"bena'an 3la alema3elewmat fi alfqrh, ayun men hedh leys methalaan 3la at3alam aletfa'eley?","The correct answer is **D: medreb dewrey alesghar** (a small tutorial figure).

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

* **The text explicitly states:** ""...wa kadhalika al-rajul al-saghir fi Microsoft Office."" (…and also the small man in Microsoft Office). This directly refers to the ""tutorial figure"" often used in software like Microsoft Office to guide users.
* **The text defines ""assaqalat"" (scaffolding) as a support system.** It gives examples like a teacher and the Microsoft Office tutorial figure.
* **The question asks for an example of *interactive* learning.** A tutorial figure *is* interactive – it guides the user through steps.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: bernamej t'eleymey fi bedayh l'ebh alekmebyewter** (a computer learning program at the beginning of the computer) – While a learning program *can* use scaffolding, the text doesn't specifically point to the program itself as the example, but rather the *within-program support* like the tutorial figure.
* **B: medres akhetbarat alekfa'h aledraseyh** (a school to train competent teachers) - This relates to *providing* scaffolding (training teachers) not *being* scaffolding itself.
* **C: bernamej derash mesteql** (an independent study program) – Independent study implies less direct support, the opposite of scaffolding.



Therefore, the small tutorial figure within software (D) is the most direct and accurate example of scaffolding as described in the text."
ay mema yely la yesf bedqh mefhewm at3alam aletfa'eley?,"The correct answer is **C: yu'eref ayedaan basem at3alam aleqa'em 3la alemsherw'** (It is known as learning based on projects).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Baynama yajib an yaj3al al-ta3allum al-8a2im 3ala al-mashari3 3amaliyati alta3allum ashal wa2akthar tashwi8an..."" (While it should make project-based learning easier and more engaging...). This directly defines the core concept.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: yemken an yewjed at3alam aletfa'eley afetradeyaan** (Project-based learning can exist independently) - While possible, the passage focuses on *scaffolding* *within* project-based learning, not the existence of the learning style itself in isolation.
* **B: hew wesyelh mesa'edh akether men kewnh teryeqh t'elem** (It is a helping tool more than a learning method) - This describes *scaffolding* itself, not project-based learning. The passage emphasizes project-based learning *as* a method.
* **D: yusetkhedm at3alam aletfa'eley letqedyem aled'em fi bedayh tejrebh at3alam** (Project-based learning is used to provide support at the beginning of a learning experience) - This describes the *function of scaffolding* *within* project-based learning, not the learning itself.



Therefore, option C best captures the core idea presented in the passage regarding what project-based learning *is*."
"wefqaan llfqrh, ma hey meyzh may sebyes alety yemken an tefyed aletlab aledyen yewajhewn mesheklh fi aleqra'h?","The correct answer is **C: 3anewan weyb wahed** (a single web address).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yumkin alwusul ila hadhihi assaf7a bi suhula min khilal tawfir 3unwan web wa7id faqat, mimma yaj3al min assahl tadhakuriha wa kitabatiha lil tullab alladhina qad yuwajihuna mushkilatan fi istikhdam law7at almafati7 aw fi attahji2a.""

This translates to: ""These pages can be easily accessed by providing only one web address, which makes it easier to remember and write for students who may have difficulty using the keyboard or spelling.""

The question asks what feature helps students who struggle with reading/writing. A single, easy-to-remember web address directly addresses this difficulty.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: aletkhesyes** (the customization) - While customization is mentioned, it doesn’t *specifically* help students with reading/writing difficulties.
*   **B: alemdewnat** (the blog) - Blogs are a feature *within* the pages, not a solution for reading/writing problems.
*   **D: 54 milyun hesab** (54 million accounts) - This is just a statistic about the website's popularity and doesn't relate to accessibility for students.

"wefqaan llfqrh, ay mema yely lm yekn jez2aan men rad Krushchev 3la a3mal shaghab al 3ummal?","The correct answer is **C: zeyadh khafd al 2ujur (increasing wage cuts)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the workers were protesting *against* wage cuts (khafd al 2ujur). Krushchev responded by conceding to *some* economic demands (ala3teraf beb3d alemtaleb alaqetsadeyh) and appointing a new Prime Minister (t3eyn r2eyes wzra2 jedyed). He also used tanks to restore order (astkhdam aldbabat laset3adh alnzam).  Therefore, *increasing* wage cuts would be the opposite of his response.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: t3eyn r2eyes wzra2 jedyed (appointing a new Prime Minister):** The passage explicitly states Krushchev agreed to appoint Wladyslaw Gomulka.
*   **B: astkhdam aldbabat laset3adh alnzam (using tanks to restore order):** The passage says Krushchev *did* send tanks.
*   **D: ala3teraf beb3d alemtaleb alaqetsadeyh (conceding to some economic demands):**  The passage specifically states Krushchev opened the door to economic concessions.



"
ayun men ataly lm yekn sebbaan a3mal shaghab fi Bolanda?,"The correct answer is **D: t3eyn Wladyslaw Gomulka (the appointment of Wladyslaw Gomulka)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Krushchev *agreed* to the appointment of Wladyslaw Gomulka as prime minister.  This was a *result* of the unrest, not a cause of it. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ashhuyu3iyya (Communism):** The passage specifically says the protests were *against* communism.
* **B: naqs al ghidha2 (lack of food):** The passage states workers were protesting a ""lack of food.""
* **C: khafd al 2ujur (reduction of wages):** The passage states workers were protesting ""reduction of wages.""

Therefore, the appointment of Gomulka wasn't a *cause* of the unrest, making it the odd one out.



"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ay men ataly lm yu2ther 3la al3laqat beyn alSovieti wa al Wilayat al Mutta7ida al amrikiya?","The correct answer is **B: alara2 7wl Almanya (the dispute over Germany)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Germany was a *common enemy* during WWII, *leading to* cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. This implies that once the common enemy (Germany) was removed, the underlying differences and conflicts began to surface. The text then explicitly states that disagreements over ideology, systems, and culture *led to* the breakdown of the alliance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: alakhetlafat aletheqafeyh (cultural differences):** The passage states cultural differences *resulted* from the breakdown, not caused it.
*   **C: al 3amaliat al mutanaqida (conflicting operations):** This is linked to the broader system/ideological conflicts, and therefore not the initial trigger.
*   **D: almnaz3at almut3aliqh bi alanzimh (disputes related to systems):**  Similar to C, this is a *result* of the breakdown, not the initial cause.

The dispute *over what to do with Germany* after WWII is what directly transitioned the relationship from cooperation to potential conflict.



"
ay mema yely la yesf bedqh alegherd men eresal alenbedat al'esebyh fi jami3 anha' alejsem?,"The correct answer is **B: edarh tadfq aldam (regulating blood flow)**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) states:** ""...lil 7ifaz 3ala tadaffuq addam duna 3a2iq"" - ""...to maintain blood flow without obstruction.""  This means the nerve impulses are *about* controlling blood flow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ebta2 tadfq aldam (starting blood flow):** The passage says maintaining, not starting.
* **C: al7efaz 3ala altawazn (maintaining balance):** While balance is *a result* of the system working, the passage focuses on the *mechanism* (nerve impulses controlling blood flow).
* **D: tejneb al thdidat aljsedyh almuhtmaleh (avoiding potential physical threats):**  Avoiding threats is a *consequence* of a healthy, functioning system, but not what the nerve impulses *directly* do.



Therefore, the passage specifically mentions the role of nerve impulses in regulating blood flow."
mada yemken al3thwr 3aleh fi hedbh alejyezh?,"The correct answer is **B: ma3abed** (temples).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...wa majmu3a min al-ma3abid..."" which translates to ""...and a collection of temples..."".  While the text *mentions* tombs (maqaber), the Great Pyramid (al-haram al-akbar), and the Seven Wonders, it doesn't say these are what can be *found* there in a general sense. The text specifically lists temples *among* the structures found at the Giza plateau.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: meqaber (tombs):** While tombs *are* present (specifically for Pharaohs and their families), the text doesn't state they are the primary thing you can find there.
* **C: jami3 al3aja2eb alsb3 (all seven wonders):** The text says the Great Pyramid is *one* of the remaining Seven Wonders, not that *all* of them are there.
* **D: alharm alakbar (the Great Pyramid):**  The text focuses on the Great Pyramid, but also mentions other structures, making this too narrow of an answer.



"
ma kan alegherd men alharm alakbar?,"The correct answer is **B: letkeryem fer'eren** (to honor the Pharaoh).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Shuyyida 2al haram 2al akbar ka naw3 min 2al takareem lel fer3an 5ofo"" which translates to ""The Great Pyramid was built as a type of honoring for the Pharaoh Khufu.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: an yesbh wahedh men 'eja'eb al'ealem alesb'** (to become one of the wonders of the world) - While true, this is a *result* of its construction, not the *reason* for it.
*   **C: leykewn ma3elemaan shheyraan** (to be a famous landmark) - Similar to A, this is a consequence, not the purpose.
*   **D: letkhezyen meqaber alashekhas aledyen matewa** (to store the tombs of the deceased) - While pyramids *contained* tombs, the primary purpose of *building* the Great Pyramid was to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, not simply to be a tomb. It was a monument to his power and divinity.



"
men alems'ewel 3an ma3ereftena balheryeq aledy demr alema3ebed?,"The correct answer is **A: سكان أفسس (The people of Ephesus)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""2a3lana 2al 2afsasiyyoun 2alghadibun 2anna 2ism Herostratus lan yusajjala abadan."" (The angry Ephesians declared that the name of Herostratus would never be recorded.) This directly indicates that the people of Ephesus were the ones who knew about and were outraged by the arson that destroyed the temple.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: الإسكندر الأكبر (Alexander the Great):** While Alexander offered to rebuild the temple, he wasn't the one who knew *about* the fire initially.
*   **C: Strabo:** Strabo *recorded* the story of the temple's destruction later, he didn't witness or know about the fire at the time it happened.
*   **D: Artemis:** Artemis is a goddess, not a person who could know about the fire.



"

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""في وقت لاحق، بعد وفاة الإسكندر، أعيد بناء المعبد في عام 323 قبل الميلاد."" (Later, after the death of Alexander, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: duf'eِt tekaleyf e'eadh alebna' men qebl Alexander alakebr** (Alexander the Great offered to pay for the rebuilding):  The text says he *offered* but was *refused*.
* **C: a'umer Herostratus betghetyh tekaleyf e'eadh alebna'** (Herostratus' life was exchanged for the rebuilding costs): The text doesn't mention this. He was simply condemned to have his name erased from history.
* **D: a'eyed bena'eh fi 3am 320 qebl alemyelad** (The rebuilding happened in 320 BC): The text specifically states it happened in 323 BC.

"wefqaan llfqrh, meta kan abekr weqt yemken an yesyer feyh new' ma 3la qedmeyn?","The correct answer is **A: mundhu sab3 malayin sana (since seven million years ago)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sahelanthropus rubbama yakunu qad sara 3ala qadamayn mundhu sab3at malayin sana"" - which translates to ""Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs since seven million years ago.""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B:** mentions two million years, which is when *Homo erectus* started walking upright, not the earliest possible time.
*   **C & D:** refer to *Australopithecus* footprints dated to 3.9-4.2 million years ago, which is *later* than the potential time for *Sahelanthropus*.



"
ay men hedh alanewa' kan yesyer banetzam 3la qedmeyn?,"The correct answer is **D: Australopithecus**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tamma al3uthur 3ala asnaf dhat qadamayn fi 7ifriyat Australopithecus mundhu 4.2-3.9 milyun sana..."" (Footprints of bipedal species were found in Australopithecus fossils since 4.2-3.9 million years ago...)
* While *Sahelanthropus* is *mentioned* as potentially walking upright earlier (7 million years ago), the passage specifically states *evidence* of regular bipedalism (walking on two feet) was found in *Australopithecus* fossils.
* *Homo Erectus* came much later in human evolution.
* ""Fesa'el dat qadamayn"" (bipedal species) is too general - we need the specific species mentioned in the text as having evidence.

Here's why:

The text states: ""كانت البحرية الألمانية تحاول إيقاف هذه الحركة، باستخدام غواصات U بشكل أساسي."" (The German navy was trying to stop this movement, using U-boats primarily).  The ""movement"" refers to the American effort to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic to *aid Britain*. Therefore, the German navy was trying to **intercept supplies coming from Britain**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: منع بريطانيا من تلقي الأشخاص والبضائع** (Preventing Britain from receiving people and goods) - While this is the *result* of their efforts, it doesn't describe *what they were trying to do*.
* **C: نقل المواد عبر المحيط الأطلسي** (Transporting materials across the Atlantic) - This is what the *Americans* were doing, not the Germans.
* **D: منع أمريكا من تلقي الأشخاص والبضائع** (Preventing America from receiving people and goods) - The primary target was the supply line *to Britain*, not directly preventing supplies reaching America.

"bena'an 3la alema3elewmat alewaredh fi alfqrh, men heqq akebr nejah fi alherb alebheryh khelal hemlh shemal alatelsey?","The correct answer is **A: alebreytaneywen walameryekyewn (The British and the Americans)**.

Here's why:

The text states the Americans tried to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic to *help* Britain. It also highlights that the German navy attempted to *stop* this movement. The passage emphasizes the importance of the Allies (implicitly Britain and America) maintaining their ability to transport people and goods, and hindering the enemy's ability to do the same.  The implication is that *successfully* aiding Britain was key, and the Americans were crucial in that effort.  The passage suggests a potential German victory (invasion of Britain) *if* the Allies had failed. This highlights the success of the British and Americans in preventing that outcome.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: alalman (The Germans):** The text describes the Germans *trying* to disrupt transport, not succeeding in a major way.
* **C: alaleman walebreytaneywen (The Germans and the British):**  The British were on the receiving end of aid, and the Germans were trying to *prevent* success, not achieve it alongside the British.
* **D: alebreytaneywen (The British):** While vital, the British success was *aided* by the American efforts. It wasn’t solely a British achievement.

The text explicitly states: ""lam yakon al-sarj 8ad okhtori3a ba3d, lithalika 7araba al-fursan al-ashurioun 3ala '6uhur khyolihim al-3aria.""  This translates to ""The saddle had not yet been invented, therefore the Assyrian cavalry rode bareback on their horses.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: alaqewas** (the bows) - The text mentions bows being used (""takhtariqa siham al aqwas"")
* **C: al'erebat** (the chariots) - The text discusses chariots as something the cavalry improved upon.
* **D: aledrew'** (the shield) - The text doesn't mention shields specifically.

The text specifically states: ""lam yakon al-sarj 8ad okhtari3a ba3d, lithalika 7araba al-fursan al-ashurioun 3ala '6uhur khyolihim al-3aria.""  This translates to ""The saddle had not yet been invented, therefore the Assyrian cavalry rode on the bare backs of their horses.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 3la aleqdemyen** (on the ancients/former times) - This is too vague and doesn't describe *how* they fought.
* **B: bedwen derw'** (Bedouin style) - The text doesn't mention any connection to Bedouin fighting styles.
* **D: ma3 jenwed aqel** (with fewer soldiers) - The text doesn't relate the number of soldiers to *how* the cavalry fought.

"wefqaan llfqrh, ayen len tejd mewatenaan babelyaan 'eadeyaan?","The correct answer is **A: yejleb qerabeyn ela sahh ma3ebed** (he brings sacrifices to the courtyard of the temple).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""كان الناس يقدمون القرابين للآلهة"" (People would offer sacrifices to the gods).  This directly links the offering of sacrifices (قربان - *qurban*) to the temples (معبد - *ma3bad*) and their courtyards (صح - *sa77*). The passage describes the temple courtyard as the place where people interacted with the gods through offerings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: يهدّر احتفالاً في معبد أساسي** (he holds a celebration in a main temple) - While celebrations happened, the passage doesn't state this is where *ordinary* Babylonians found a dwelling for the god.
* **C: في حيد في صح معبد** (in a hideaway in the temple courtyard) - There are no 'hideaways' mentioned. The passage refers to an inner sanctuary only accessible to priests.
* **D: يجلِب قربانًا إلى خلوة أمنه** (he brings a sacrifice to his safe seclusion) - This doesn't relate to the passage's description of Babylonian religious practice.



"
ay mema yely kan mekhessaan lelkhenh thedyedaan?,"The correct answer is **A: alahetfalat (الاحتفالات)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...والكهنة يحاولون تلبية احتياجات الآلهة من خلال **الاحتفالات** والأعياد"" (...and the priests would try to fulfill the gods' needs through **rituals/ceremonies** and festivals).

The question asks what was specific to the dedicated priests. Rituals and ceremonies (احتفالات) were *their* job – fulfilling the gods' needs through these practices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: alekhelwh alamenh (الخلوة الأمنة):**  This refers to the inner sanctuary of the temple, accessible only to priests, but it's a *place*, not something they *did*.
*   **C: ala'eyad (الأعياد):** Festivals were part of the worship, but not specifically *the priests'* domain alone; the people participated.
*   **D: alezqewrh (الزقورات):** Ziggurats were the temple towers, a *structure*, not something specific to the priests' work.



"
meta aketseb alemlek tewt 3anekh amewn sema3eh sey'eh?,"The correct answer is **C: b3d aketshaf qebrh** (after the discovery of his tomb).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Wa ma3a dhalika, fa inna ektishafa qabrihi fi 3am 1922 ja3aluhu min al mashahir."" (And despite that, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous.)

This directly links Tutankhamun's fame to the discovery of his tomb. The passage highlights that he wasn't well-known in ancient times or listed in many king lists, but *became* famous *after* his tomb was found.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: b3d serqh qebrh** (after his tomb was robbed) - The passage specifically states his tomb *wasn't* robbed significantly.
*   **B: khelal 'ehedh** (during his reign) - The passage states he wasn't important *during* his reign.
*   **D: b3d dekrh fi lewa'eh alemlewk aleqdeymh** (after mention in ancient king lists) - The passage states he was *not* mentioned in most ancient king lists.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Wa ma3a dhalika, fa inna ektishafa qabrihi fi 3am 1922 ja3aluhu min al mashahir. Fi 7in tamma naheb al 3adid min al qubur al qadima, illa annahu lam yattem al 3abath bi hadha al qabr.""  This translates to: ""Despite that, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous. While many ancient tombs were looted, this tomb was not disturbed.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: wed'eh fi lewa'eh alemlek aleqdeymh** (His position in the lists of ancient kings) - The passage states he *wasn't* important and *wasn't* on most lists of ancient kings.
* **C: serqh alaf aleqt' alatheryh men qebrh** (Thousands of artifacts were stolen from his tomb) - The passage states the opposite: most of the artifacts were found *intact*.
* **D: ahemyeth khelal al'esewr alemseryh aleqdeymh** (His importance during the ancient Egyptian era) - The passage states he *lacked* importance during his time.

Therefore, Homer was blind, meaning he was unable to see.

The correct answer is **B: aler'eyh** (the sight/vision).



"

(Another famous Greek is the mathematician Pythagoras, most known for his famous theory about the relationship between the sides of right triangles.) This clearly indicates Pythagoras is known for mathematics, *not* literature.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sophocles:** The passage identifies Sophocles as a playwright (a type of literature).
* **B: Homer:** The passage explicitly states Homer is a poet (literature - *Iliad* and *Odyssey*).
* **D: Aristophanes:**  The passage identifies Aristophanes as a playwright (literature).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: fi aleshar' (في الشارع)** - The passage mentions streets but not as where families *spent their time*.
* **C: fi alefna' (في الفناء)** - While women were *in* the courtyard, the passage states families generally lived outside.
* **D: fi alemnezl (في المنزل)** - The passage explicitly says the homes weren't considered important, and people lived *outside* of them.



"
ma aledy lm yekn mhemaan jedaan lel'ea'elh al'eberyh?,"The correct answer is **C: menazelhem (their homes)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""لم يمثل المنزل أهمية بالغة"" (Lam yumathel al manzel ahamiya balighah) - ""The home did not represent great importance.""  This directly answers the question of what wasn't very important to the Hebrew families.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: menakhhem (their climate)** - The passage *describes* the climate (""al sharq al awsat al dafe2"" - the warm Middle East), but doesn't say it wasn't important.
*   **B: metajerhem (their stores)** - The passage describes the stores (""كانت المتاجر مجرد منافذ مفتوحة"" - the stores were just open outlets), but doesn't say they weren't important.
*   **D: tebkhhem (their cooking)** - The passage doesn't mention cooking at all.



"

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: aletareykh (the history)** - While history differs, the passage focuses on *current* differences between the countries.
*   **B: alared (the land/territory)** - The passage doesn't focus on geographical differences, but on cultural ones.
*   **D: alesh'eb (the people)** - The passage mentions differences *between* the peoples, but it's the *customs* that are listed as a defining difference.



"

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...kanat qaba2el al Eskimo ta3ish hunak bil fi3l fi dhalika al waqet."" ( ""...the Eskimo tribes were actually living there at that time."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: alenrewyejyewn (النرويجيون)** - While Vikings (including Norwegians) *later* explored and settled parts of Greenland, the passage says Eskimos were there *first*.
*   **C: Erik alahemr (إريك الأحمر)** - Erik the Red *named* Greenland, but didn't settle it first. The text says he *found* it, implying others were already there.
*   **D: alesweydeywen (السويديون)** - Similar to the Norwegians, Swedes were part of the Scandinavian explorations, but not the first inhabitants.



"

This translates to: ""While the poor and women ate their food while sitting on chairs, the wealthy men preferred to recline together while eating their meals.""

Therefore, poor Roman men ate while sitting in chairs.



"
ay mema yely len yekwen jez'aan men welyemh rewmaneyh qedyemh?,"The correct answer is **B: meqbelat men aleqwaq'** (appetizers of snails).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that snails (الحلزون) were a somewhat unusual food eaten during feasts by the Romans.  It lists them alongside wild boar and dormice as part of their festive meals. However, the passage also states that Romans *didn't* have foods that came from the Americas or Asia in later centuries (like tomatoes, potatoes, corn, cacao). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: deywef feqra' yetnawelwen alet3am 3la alekrasey** (poor people eating food while sitting on chairs) - The passage *describes* this as a common practice for the poor and women.
* **C: rejal atherya' yestelqewn athena' al'esha'** (wealthy men reclining while eating dinner) -  The passage *describes* this as the dining style of wealthy Roman men.
* **D: tebq men aledyek alerwemy alemshewy** (dish of roasted peacock) - The passage *mentions* peacock (ديك رومي) as something the *older* Romans did *not* eat, meaning it was a later addition, not part of the *ancient* Roman diet.



Therefore, **B** is the only option that definitively represents something that *was* part of the ancient Roman diet, as specifically mentioned in the text."
"bena'an 3la alfqrh, ay mema yely men gheyr alemrejh an yekwen lh tatheyr da'em?","The correct answer is **D: theqafh hedaria (حضارة - civilization)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly defines *ḥaḍāra* (civilization) and states that it's a unique culture shared by a large group of people living and working cooperatively (a society). It emphasizes that civilizations *transmit knowledge across generations* and leave a lasting cultural imprint. The passage specifically contrasts this with smaller cultures that might disappear without leaving significant historical evidence, and therefore not be recognized as a full *ḥaḍāra*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: mejtema3 (مجتمع - society):** While a civilization *includes* a society, it's broader than just the societal structure. The passage defines civilization *as* a specific kind of shared culture within a society.
*   **B: theqafh seghera (ثقافة صغيرة - small culture):** The passage specifically contrasts civilizations *with* smaller cultures that are more likely to be forgotten.
*   **C: medyenh mesteqlh dateyaan (مدينة مستقلة ذاتيان - independent city-state):** The passage mentions city-states as ancestors of nations, but it doesn't define civilization *as* a city-state.  City-states are a *form* a civilization can take, but not the civilization itself.



Therefore, the passage consistently focuses on *ḥaḍāra* (civilization) as the element with a lasting impact and cultural transmission, making it the most appropriate answer."
"wefqaan llfqrh, ma aledy yesbeq alamh?","The correct answer is **A: theqafh hedaria (حضارة ثقافية)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ta3ni al thaqafa al 7adariyya naqel al ma3rifa 3abra 3eddat ajyal, wa basma thaqafiyya baqiya wa nasher 3adel.""  This translates to: ""Civilizational culture means the transfer of knowledge across generations, and a cultural imprint that remains and spreads justly.""

The question asks what *precedes* a civilization according to the passage. The passage describes *civilizational culture* as a defining characteristic *of* a civilization, not something that comes before it. Therefore, the closest answer is civilizational culture itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: theqafh mefredh (ثقافة مفردة)** - ""Single culture"" - The passage discusses shared culture within a large group, not a single, isolated one.
* **C: medyenh mesteqlh dateyaan (مدينة مستقلة ذاتية)** - ""Independent self-sufficient city"" - While the passage mentions city-states as predecessors to nations, it doesn't say this *is* what precedes a civilization. It's a historical point, not a defining prerequisite.
* **D: aletheqafat alesghera (الثقافات الصغيرة)** - ""Small cultures"" - The passage actually contrasts these with civilizations, stating they can disappear without leaving historical evidence and not being recognized as proper civilizations.

ay jemlh 7wl Drukgyal Dzong leyset sheyhh?,"The correct answer is **C: demr heryeq al3adid men athar aleql'eh** (destroyed many of the castle's artifacts).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Fi 3am 1951, tasabbaba 7ariq fi baqa2 ba3d athar Drukgyal Dzong, mithl surat Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal."" (In 1951, a fire caused the loss of some of Drukgyal Dzong's artifacts, such as a portrait of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.) This directly implies damage and loss of artifacts, not complete destruction of *many* artifacts.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

* **A: buneyt lelahetfal banetsar aleqwat aletbetyh alemg7wleyh** (was built to commemorate the victory over Tibetan-Mongolian forces) - The passage explicitly says this: ""ansha2a Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel al qal3a li 2e7ya2 dhekra entisarihi 3al quwat al Tibet al Mangoliyya.""
* **B: teq' fi Bhutan** (located in Bhutan) - The passage states it's in the upper part of Paro district in Bhutan: ""wa hiya tadom dayran budhiy fil juz2 al 3elwiy min muqata3at Paro (fi qaryat Phondey).""
* **D: aneshaha Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel** (was established by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel) - The passage states: ""ansha2a Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel al qal3a"" (Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the fortress).

Here's why:

The text states: ""في عام 1951، تسبب حريق في بقاء بعض آثار Drukgyal Dzong، مثل صورة Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal."" This translates to ""In 1951, a fire caused some damage to Drukgyal Dzong, such as a portrait of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.""  Option A directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: anetsert aleqwat aletbetyh alemg7wleyh** (The victory of the Tibetan forces) - The text says the Dzong was *built* to commemorate a victory *over* Tibetan/Mongolian forces, not that they achieved victory there.
* **C: lem tetather sh'ebeyh mekan alejdeb** (It did not become a popular attraction) - The text explicitly states it remains one of the most attractive tourist areas in Bhutan.
* **D: hafez 3aleha Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal** (Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal preserved it) - He *built* it, but the text mentions preservation efforts *after* the fire.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: demr alefyetnameywen Phnom Phen** (The Vietnamese destroyed Phnom Penh) - The passage says the *Thais* destroyed Phnom Penh, not the Vietnamese.
* **B: ghezt kembewdeya tayelaned 3am 1772** (Thailand invaded Cambodia in 1772) - While true, it doesn't fully capture the *result* of the invasion, which was the destruction of the city.
* **C: gheza alefyetnameywen kembewdeya fi bedayh aleqren alethamen 'esher** (The Vietnamese invaded Cambodia at the beginning of the eighteenth century) - The passage states the Vietnamese invasion happened in the *later* years of the eighteenth century, not the beginning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: gheza aletayelanedyewn walefyetnameywen kembewdeya 3am 1772** (The Thais and Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in 1772) - While the Thais *did* attack in 1772 (destroying Phnom Penh), the passage states the Vietnamese invaded *later* in the century.
* **C: demr alefyetnameywen Phnom Phen** (The Vietnamese destroyed Phnom Penh) - The passage states the *Thais* destroyed Phnom Penh.
* **D: gheza aletayelanedyewn kembewdeya 'edh merat** (The Thais invaded Cambodia several times) - The passage mentions Thai invasions, but doesn't specifically say *several* times, and doesn’t focus on them as the answer asks.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the Dutch East India Company *established* a base, *practiced* agricultural production, and *employed* Chinese workers.** These are all things they *did* do.
* **The passage states that Qing dynasty *took control* of parts of Taiwan and *declared* Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.** The Dutch East India Company didn't relinquish sovereignty to Qing; the Qing *took* it.

Therefore, the only action the Dutch East India Company did *not* do, according to the text, is giving up sovereignty to Qing.

This translates to: ""...after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan...""

Therefore, the Treaty of Shimonoseki resulted in Japan gaining control of Taiwan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the war *led to* the treaty, the treaty itself wasn't about Japan's defeat.
*   **B:**  The treaty didn't establish the Qing dynasty, it *removed* their control.
*   **C:** The text mentions Qing control *before* the treaty, not as a result of it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: meda asaseyh aw hemdeyh alemadh alekyemya'eyh** (whether the chemical substance is basic or acidic) - While pH *tells you* if something is acidic or basic, it doesn't *measure* pH directly. It's a result of the measurement.
* **B: 3dd al brotonat alemwejwedh fi alemadh alekyemya'eyh** (the number of protons in the chemical substance) - This relates to the atomic structure of the elements *within* the substance, not the acidity/alkalinity (pH) of the substance itself.

The text specifically states: ""Ayunat al-haydrojyn 3ibara 3an brotonat jurridat min elektronatiha"" which translates to ""Hydrogen ions are protons stripped of their electrons.""  Therefore, hydrogen ions *are* protons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: raqem al2as al-haydrwjiny (the pH number):** pH is a *measure* of hydrogen ion concentration, not what hydrogen ions *are*.
* **C: al quluwiya (the alkalinity):** Alkalinity is a property of bases, related to pH, but not the ions themselves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: nesbh aledkewr ela alenath leyset metsaweyh** (The ratio of males to females is not equal) - While the passage mentions a lower number of males compared to females, it doesn't focus on this *imbalance* as a defining characteristic.
* **C: aledkewr walenath jami3ehem mertebtewn aretbataan wetheyqaan** (Males and females are all ranked closely) - The passage states females are ranked closely *by lineage*, not that all lions (male and female) are closely ranked.
* **D: hem memyetwen wajetma'eyewn** (They are deadly and social) - While true, this is a general statement and not the specific detail asked for about *how* they behave.  The passage highlights *how* they behave - like dogs/wolves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: hem ajetma'eyewn lelghayh** (They are very social) - While true, the passage focuses on *how* they are social, comparing it to wolves and dogs, not just *that* they are social.
* **C: kel men aledkewr walenath memyetwen lelghayh balensebh lelferyesh** (Each male and female is deadly to their prey) - The passage says lions are ""deadly to their prey,"" but doesn't specify this applies to *each* male and female.

This translates to: ""There are predatory animals of varying sizes that feed on prey of varying sizes, starting from rabbits and ending with wolves and gazelles.""

The question asks: ""Are rabbits common prey for predatory animals?""

Since the passage *specifically mentions rabbits as a starting point for the prey of these predators*, the correct answer is:

**A: aleqtet alesgheyrh** (small prey) 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: aleqtet alekbeyrh** (large prey): The passage implies rabbits are at the *smaller* end of the prey spectrum.
* **C: aleqtet metwesth alhejm** (medium-sized prey): While rabbits might *sometimes* be prey for medium-sized animals, the passage positions them as being preyed upon by a wide range, starting with them.

This translates to ""...the small predators (including domestic sparkling predators) that eat the smaller butterflies/moths in the largest numbers, such as insects, **quails**, and birds.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: aletmahey ma3 m7ythem** (the environment with them) - The passage mentions camouflage *within* the environment, but it's not something the jaguar *doesn't* do as part of its hunting strategy. It *is* part of it.
*   **B: eteba' ra'ehh feryesthem** (following the smell of their prey) - The passage explicitly states jaguars use smell to locate prey.
*   **C: eteba' feryesthem athena' alelyel** (following prey at night) - The passage states they have good night vision, indicating they hunt at night.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: hem qaderwen 3la alesyed alejyed fi alelyel** (they are capable of good vision at night) - The passage *does* mention good night vision, but this isn't something the passage states the jaguar is *not* known for. It's a characteristic *of* the jaguar.

* **C: hash aleshem ledyhem d'eyefh** (their sense of smell is weak) -  The passage specifically says the ocelot (a related animal, used to illustrate a point about jaguars) *uses* its sense of smell to hunt, implying a *strong* sense of smell, not a weak one.

* **A: mejmew'eh segheyrh tefshel fi alazedhar fi mewq' jedyed** (a small group fails to flourish in a new location) - The passage doesn't say the group *fails*; it says they *need to adapt* to be more competitive.  Success isn't guaranteed, but failure isn't the starting point.

* **A: yhedth 3anedma yekwen aleskan alejded gheyr qaderyen 3la aletkeyf (occurs when new settlers are unable to adapt)** - While adaptation *is* discussed in the passage, the *antiwa3* (speciation) process itself isn't *caused* by a failure to adapt. It's a consequence of adaptation to *different* environments.
* **B: hey janeb hasem fi 3malyh alettewr (is a negative side in the evolution process)** - The passage describes *antiwa3* as a *result* and a *critical part* of evolution, not a negative side effect.
* **D: la mefr men hedwethha (it is inevitable)** - The passage doesn’t state that speciation is inevitable, only that it happens *as a result* of certain conditions (isolation and different environments).



Therefore, option C directly reflects the definition and purpose of *antiwa3* (speciation) as described in the text."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: al sharayin** (the arteries) - The passage states arteries *carry blood away* from the heart.
* **B: al shu3ayrat al damawiyya** (the capillaries) - These are the smallest tubes, involved in exchange, not directly returning blood to the heart.
* **C: Al-a3da2** (the muscle/organ - likely referring to the heart itself) - While the heart *is* part of the circulatory system, it doesn't *bring* blood to itself; it *receives* it.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states directly:** ""Asghar al anabib tusamma al shu3ayrat al damawiyya"" which translates to ""The smallest tubes are called capillaries.""
* **The question (Q) asks:** ""What are the smallest tubes in the circulatory system?""

Therefore, **al shu3ayrat al damawiyya (capillaries)** is the correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: al sharayin (arteries):** The passage states arteries carry blood *away* from the heart, not that they are the smallest.
* **C: al awrida (veins):** The passage states veins carry blood *to* the heart, not that they are the smallest.
* **D: Al-a3da2 (organs):**  Organs are not tubes, and not directly related to the question about blood vessel size.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hadha al2amr yamna7uha majmu3a wasi3a min alamakn assaghira lil ikhtiba2 min al7aywanat almuftarisa."" (This allows them a wide range of small places to hide from predators.)
* This directly links the ability to fold their wings to *increasing their hiding places*.  By folding their wings, insects can squeeze into smaller spaces, making it harder for predators to find them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: emedadat alegheda' (امتداد الأغدية - food extension):** The passage discusses food *searching*, but not food *extension* related to wing folding.
* **C: al'ethewr 3la alazewaj (الإعثر على الأزواج - finding mates):** While the passage mentions finding mates, it doesn't connect this to the wing-folding ability.
* **D: ser'eh aletyeran (سرعة الطيران - flight speed):** The passage doesn’t suggest wing folding impacts flight speed. It states folding wings helps with *hiding*.



Therefore, **B** is the best and most directly supported answer from the text."

This translates to ""...their ability to fly allowed them to escape from enemies and avoid them easily...""  Therefore, the *group of enemies* is directly stated as something affected by the insect's ability to fly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aletkather (multiplication/abundance):** The passage doesn't mention how flying affects insect population size.
* **B: meda alheyah (lifespan):**  The passage doesn't discuss lifespan.
* **D: alef'ealeyh (actions/deeds):** This is too vague and not related to the text's focus on survival and reproduction.

This indicates feathers are a characteristic that *distinguishes* them from what people typically think of as dinosaurs. The passage then goes on to list features they *do* share with dinosaurs (scales, claws, laying eggs, walking on hind legs).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: alemshey 3la alesaq alekhelfeyh (walking on hind legs)** - The passage states they *do* walk on their hind legs like T-Rex.
*   **C: wed' alebyewd (laying eggs)** - The passage states they *do* lay eggs.

This highlights flying as the key difference people perceive between birds and dinosaurs. The passage then goes on to list *similarities* – claws, laying eggs, walking on two legs – to show they *aren't* completely different.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: wed' alebyed** (laying eggs) - The passage states dinosaurs *do* lay eggs, just like birds.
*   **B: asetkhedam alesaqeyn alekhelfeyteyn lelmeshey** (using hind legs for walking) -  The passage specifically mentions dinosaurs walking on their hind legs like the T-Rex.

While the text mentions the Triceratops *could* eat the trunk (al jidh3), it specifically states they would first remove and eat the prickly leaves (al awraq al sha'ekh). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: alejd' (the trunk):** The text says they ate the trunk *after* removing the leaves.

This translates to: ""...recent scholars believe that this plant is very poisonous, therefore it's unlikely any dinosaur would eat it, *however*, sloths and *other animals like parrots (descendants of dinosaurs)* may eat the leaves or fruit.""

Therefore, the text explicitly mentions parrots as being able to eat the plant.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: heywan alekselan (sloth):** While sloths *might* eat the plant, the text presents them alongside parrots as examples, not as the primary animal likely to eat it.
*   **B: nebt dat ferw' selbh (plant with tough branches):**  This is what the Triceratops ate, not what the question is asking about.

This translates to: ""Previously, the current areas from Belgium were part of Luxembourg, but they became Belgium after the Belgian Revolution in the thirties of the thirteenth century."" (Note: there's a slight error in the original Arabic text regarding the century, it should be the 19th century).

Therefore, the Belgian Revolution is the event that caused parts of Luxembourg to become Belgium.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

The question (Q) asks what is being mixed on advanced computers according to the text. The answer is clearly the sounds (aleswer).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: alemwesyeqa (the music)** - While music *is* recorded, the passage specifically talks about processing and mixing the *sounds* that make up the music.
*   **B: alersewm alemt7erkh (the animated graphics)** - The passage mentions animated graphics, but not in relation to mixing on computers.

The question asks where toilets were *most commonly* found with drainage systems. Mohenjo-daro (along with Harappa) is specifically mentioned as having this feature in *almost every house*. The other options (Persia, Santorini, and China) are mentioned as having toilets, but not with the same level of pervasiveness and connection to drainage systems.



"

The passage states: ""Kana li madinatay Harappa wa Mohenjo-daro mer7adh bi nidham shatef fi kulli manzilin taqriban mutasel bi nizam sarf si77i muta6awer.""  This translates to: ""The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every house connected to a sophisticated drainage system."" 

This directly indicates that Harappa had a developed sewage/drainage network. The passage only *found remains of* toilets in the other locations (Santorini, Crete, Egypt, Persia, and China), but doesn't state they had *connected* drainage systems like Harappa.  The Roman toilets were part of public baths, not individual home systems.

This translates to: ""Considering that the lower part of the blade is slightly curved, where the blade tilts to one side or the other, the contacting edge for the skin also tilts. This causes the slider to rotate.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: alhewaf alemzedwejh 3la tewl shefrh aletzelj** (The double edge along the length of the razor blade) - While the passage mentions a double edge, it doesn't say *that* causes the rotation.
* **C: mestewa alemharh al3am lelmetzelj** (The general alignment of the slider) - The passage doesn't discuss general alignment.
* **D: jewdh alejleyd** (The presence of the skin) - The skin is acted *upon* by the rotation, but doesn’t cause it.



Therefore, the curvature of the lower part of the blade is the direct cause of the slider's rotation."

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the blade (shafra) of the modern razor as having a ""7affah muzdawaja ma3 tajwif muqa33ar baynahuma"" (double edge with a counter-curve between them).**  This means the blade isn't straight; it curves.
* **The passage further explains that the lower part of the blade is ""mun7ani qalilan"" (slightly curved) and this causes the slider (mutazalej) to rotate.** This confirms the blade has a curved shape.
* **""Menhenyh"" (منحنية) means curved.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: dat hedyen (ذات حدين)** -  Means ""double-edged."" While true, it doesn't describe *how* the edge is shaped (the curve).
* **C: meq'erh (مقعرة)** - Means ""concave.""  While there's a curve, the description doesn't specify it's concave; it's a more general curve.
* **D: ma'elh (معلقة)** - Means ""suspended"" or ""hanging."" This has nothing to do with the blade's shape.

The text describes how atoms at a higher energy level return to a lower level by releasing a small particle of light called a ""photon"". This process is specifically called ""al enbi3ath al-musta7ath lel esh3a3"" (stimulated emission of radiation), which the text clarifies involves the emission of photons.  This is the mechanism by which atoms get rid of excess energy in the form of light.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **C: alefwetwen (photons)** - Photons are the *particles* of light emitted, not the process of getting rid of the energy.
*   **D: alaneb'eath alemhefِz lelesh'ea' (stimulated emission of radiation)** - This is a slightly different wording of the correct answer, but the text uses ""al enbi3ath al-musta7ath lel esh3a3"" which translates to stimulated emission of radiation, specifically focusing on photons.

The text explains that atoms at a certain level (""mustawa al-6a8a al-sabi8"") need to *give up* the energy they acquired (""al-6a8a al-2i'9afiya"") by emitting a photon. This happens because the atom is in an excited state, and the emission of a photon allows it to return to a more stable state.  The process is even called ""al enbi3ath al-musta7ath lel esh3a3"" (stimulated emission of radiation), implying a transition *from* an unstable to a stable state.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: etelaq aletaqh aleza'edh** (releasing excess energy) - While related, the text focuses on *why* energy is released, not just that it *is* released. The instability is the root cause.
* **B: alethefyez alenajem 3an aledw' alesat'** (light affecting the atom) - The text explains the *result* of energy release (light/photons), not what causes the initial release.
* **D: red f'el 3la alesh'ea'** (reaction to radiation) - This is not mentioned in the text; the text describes the *emission* of radiation, not a reaction *to* it.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...*yata6allab al amr saru5an 3emlaqan yazid ertifa3ahu 3an 100 qadam li wadhe3 qamar sina3iy aw teleskob fil fadha2.*""  This translates to ""...the matter involves a giant crane that rises more than 100 feet to place an artificial moon or telescope in space.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ash'eh aledw'** (rays of light) - While light is *involved* in the communication, it's not the *tool* used to get the telescope into space.
* **B: aleswareykh** (the rocket) - The rocket is used to send the artificial moon to space, but it doesn't *help* with using the telescope itself.
* **C: aleghelaf alejwey lekwekb alared** (the atmosphere of Mars) - The atmosphere of Mars is mentioned as a problem the scientists work around, not a tool they use.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**al7adath addwry huwa shay2un ya7duthu miraran wa tikraran bi shaklin muntazam.**"" (A periodic event is something that happens repeatedly in a regular manner). 

The question asks what you need to *observe* about a periodic event to track the passage of time.  The passage clearly identifies **repetition** as the key characteristic of a periodic event that allows us to measure time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: almdh (المد - Duration/Length):** While duration is *related* to time, the passage focuses on *how we perceive* time passing through repeated events, not the length of those events.
*   **C: alather (الأثر - Effect/Impact):** The effect of an event doesn't help us measure time.
*   **D: als'ewebh (الصعوبة - Difficulty):**  The passage mentions time is difficult to understand, but that's not something to observe about periodic events.

The passage explicitly links the passage of time to observing repeating events. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: altwl (الطول - length)** - While duration is *related* to time, the passage doesn't say length *is* how we measure it.
*   **C: alakhetbar (الاختبار - testing)** - This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **D: alather (الأثر - effect)** - The effect of time is discussed, but not how we *measure* it.

Here's why:

The passage states that despite being able to join the army directly after school, Charles *went to university first*. This is presented as a deviation from the expected path for a heir, and the passage specifically highlights that he went to university *before* joining the army.  The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: al7osol 3la derjh 2:2** (getting a 2:2 degree) - While mentioned, it's not presented as *the* defining characteristic of being a modern heir.
*   **B: aletkhely 3an alejama3eh lelanedmam ela alejyesh** (forgoing university to join the army) - The passage states he *didn't* do this.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kana Tshharles awal fard fi al-3a2ila al-malika al-britaniya ya7sul 3ala daraja 3ilmiya."" This translates to ""Charles was the first person in the British royal family to obtain a degree."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: anedm ela alejyesh qebl alanetha' men alemdersh (joined the army before finishing school):** The text says he *could* have joined the army directly, but he *didn't*. He went to university instead.
*   **B: ders 'elem alathar (studied archaeology):** While he *did* study archaeology, the text highlights him being the first to get a degree, not specifically studying archaeology.
*   **D: aletheq bekleyh Trinity (attended Trinity College):**  Attending the college is a part of getting the degree, but the key fact the text emphasizes is *receiving* the degree itself.

The text states: ""...wa houwa muwaten Narwijiy ya6ma7 li esti3adat biladihi min al haymana al Danimarkiyya."" which translates to ""...and he is a Norwegian citizen working to reclaim his country from Danish domination.""

Therefore, Olaf Trygvasson was from Norway.

Here's why:

The text states ""Bi 7ulul al qarn al khames 3ashar..."" which translates to ""By the 13th century..."".  We are currently in the 21st century. 21 - 13 = 8 centuries, or approximately 800 years.  The text explicitly states that German cultural influence was significant in North Estonia *during* the 13th century.

Therefore, the German influence began around 800 years ago.



"
bemada tathert alelghh alasetwenyh?,"The correct answer is **B: alabejdeyh alalemaneyh** (the German alphabet).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the Estonian written language *was based on* the German alphabet (""Kana ya3tamed 3ala al abjadiyya al Almaniyyah"").  This is the most significant way German culture impacted the Estonian language, as it provided the foundation for its writing system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: alherf Õ/õ** (the letter Õ/õ) - While important, this is *a result* of the influence, not the primary influence itself.
* **C: alerheban alaleman** (the German monks) - They were the *agents* of change, but not the change itself.
* **D: alalh** (the meaning/divinity) - The monks tried to convey religious meaning, but this isn’t a direct impact on the *language* itself.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tatarawa7 al taqdirat min 340 milyon ila 500 milyon muta7addith, wa ma yasil ila 800 milyon shakhs yumkinuhum fahm al lugha."" (Estimates range from 340 million to 500 million speakers, and up to 800 million people can understand the language.)

This directly indicates that the number fluctuates depending on *whether you count those who can understand the language* in addition to those who actively speak it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: eda tem ahetsab lhejat meshabhh jedaan lelghh alhendeyh** (if you count dialects very similar to the Hindi language) - While the text mentions dialects, it doesn't say the number *changes* based on including them.
*   **B: eda tem 'ed alemthedtheyn balelghh alaredyh** (if you count speakers of Urdu language) - The text mentions the similarity between Hindi and Urdu, but doesn't state the number changes *because* of counting Urdu speakers.
*   **D: eda tem ahetsab alashekhas aledyen yemkenhem qera'h alelghh** (if you count the people who can read the language) - The text doesn't mention reading ability as a factor in the fluctuating numbers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eadh ma yekwen henak anefsal beyn alemthedtheyn balelghetyen** (Whether there is a separation between the speakers of the two languages) - The passage doesn't focus on a separation of speakers, but on the languages themselves.
* **C: enha metshabhh fi kel men alemferdat walens** (They are similar in both vocabulary and meaning) - While they *are* similar in vocabulary, the passage explicitly states they differ in writing.  ""Walens"" (meaning/sense) isn't directly discussed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: tem akhetra'eha fi bedayh 'ehed alemlek seyjewnej** (it was invented at the beginning of King Sejong's reign) - The passage states it was invented in 1444, *during* his reign (1418-1450), not necessarily at the beginning.
* **B: kan alasem alasely lelabejdeyh hewnan jeywenjewm** (the original name of the alphabet was Hunmin Jeongum) - This is *true* according to the passage, but the question asks for something that is *not* true.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""2utliqa fil asel 3ala abjadiyat al Hangeul isim Hummin Jeongeum..."" This directly translates to ""Originally, the alphabet Hangeul was called Hummin Jeongeum...""  Therefore, Hummin Jeongeum *became* Hangeul.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sejong:** Sejong was the king who commissioned the alphabet, not what it changed *to*.
* **C: Joseon:** Joseon was the dynasty, not the new name of the alphabet.
* **D: Jeongeum:** Jeongeum is part of the original name (Hummin Jeongeum), not the final evolved name.

This translates to: ""The Sanskrit language is a very complex and rich language that was a source for many modern languages, just like Latin, which is considered a source for European languages such as French and Spanish.""

Therefore, the text directly links Sanskrit to influencing European languages, just as Latin did.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: al lughat alelateyneyh (the two languages):**  The text doesn't mention only two influenced languages.
*   **C: al lughat alqdeymh (ancient languages):** While Sanskrit *is* an ancient language, the text focuses on its influence on *modern* languages, specifically European ones.
*   **D: al lughat alhendeyh (Indian languages):**  The text mentions the Aryan migration *to* India, but doesn't state Sanskrit significantly influenced other Indian languages *from* within India, as its primary impact is described as being on languages further West."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: alet'eqeyd (the belief/creed)** - The passage doesn't mention any belief system causing the decline.
*   **B: alhejrh alareh (Aryan migration)** - While the passage mentions Aryan migration as a theory for the *origin* of Sanskrit, it doesn't say it caused the language to decline.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Idha waqafta 3ala sat7 lo, fa sayakun waznuka aqalu mimma howa 3ala al ared."" This means ""If you stood on its surface, your weight would be less than it is on Earth.""
* **The passage explains why:** Lower gravity on the other planet (Eye) means less pull, and therefore less weight.  A person weighing 200 pounds on Earth weighs only 36 pounds on Eye.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** Incorrect.  The passage says weight *decreases* due to lower gravity, not that Eye's gravity pulls *more*.
* **C:** Incorrect. Weight decreases, not increases.
* **D:** Incorrect.  The passage explicitly states the opposite - Earth's gravity pulls *more* than Eye's gravity.

The passage explicitly mentions people wondering ""if extraterrestrial beings or other life may live on another planet or not.""  This is the central question posed within the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: safer alebsher ela nejwem akhera** (human travel to other stars) - While mentioned as a dream, the passage emphasizes *how distant* and *unlikely* this is in the foreseeable future. It's not the core belief being discussed.
* **B: alebsher gheyr qaderyen 3la asetkeshaf 'ewalem akhera** (humans are incapable of exploring other worlds) - The passage doesn't state humans are *incapable*, only that it's a very long way off.

This translates to ""The Amazon River is also considered the widest river on Earth, where its width reaches six miles in some places.""  So it *is* a descriptor of the Amazon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: enh thaney atewl nher (that it is the second longest river):** The passage states ""Nahr al-Amazon huwa thany atwal wa akbar nahr..."" (The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river...). This *is* a descriptor.

"3anedma yetgheyr shekl alema', ma aledy seybeqa kema hew?","The passage explains that while the *physical state* of a substance can change (gas, liquid, solid), its *chemical composition* remains the same. The example of water (H₂O) is used – it's still H₂O whether it's ice, water, or steam.

Therefore, the answer is **C: alhalh alefyezya'eyh** (its physical state).  The passage explicitly states that the physical state changes, but the chemical state remains the same.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: alebneyh alejzey'eyh** (its molecular structure) - While related, the passage focuses on the overall chemical *composition* (like H₂O) rather than the specific molecular arrangement.
* **B: alekthafh** (its density) - Density changes with state (gas is less dense than liquid), so it's *not* something that stays the same.
* **D: alenterwejyen alesa'el** (the liquid energy) - This isn't a concept discussed in the passage and isn't a fundamental property that remains constant.

"wefqaan llfqrh, ay mema yely lm yekn mesheklh lelwelayat alethelath 'esherh 3nd mhawelh ferd qewaneyn ma3eyenh?","The correct answer is **C: alet'edeylat alety tettelb alemwafeqh balejema'** (The amendments that required unanimous consent).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tatalabat al mawad mouwafaqa bi ejma3 min jami3 al wilayat an yujri ta3dilaha"" - which translates to ""Amendments required unanimous consent from all the states to be enacted.""  This was a major problem because getting *every* state to agree was extremely difficult.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: esheraf kebyer men seltat aledwelh** (Great supervision of state authority) - The passage mentions states being uncooperative, but doesn't say there was *supervision* hindering law enforcement.
* **B: neqs alesleth dakhel alekwenghers** (Lack of authority within Congress) - While the passage *does* say Congress lacked the power to enforce laws, the question asks about the problem of enacting *specific* laws. The lack of enforcement was a *result* of the lack of power, not the initial hurdle.
* **D: 3dm wejwed selth tenfeydeyh wetneyh** (Lack of executive and judicial authority) - This is also mentioned in the passage, but it's about *enforcement* of laws, not the initial ability to *pass* them. The primary obstacle to changing anything was the unanimous consent requirement.



Therefore, the inability to amend the Articles of Confederation due to the unanimous consent rule was the biggest problem for the thirteen states when trying to enact laws."

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Kana al Kongres yaftaqer 2ela ay solta li fard 2al 9ara2eb..."" (The Congress lacked any authority to levy taxes...).  It then says it relied on state governments, which were often uncooperative. This directly reflects option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: kanet alet'edeylat 3la alemwad t'etemd 3la selth alekwenghers** (Amendments to the articles required the consent of the Congress) - While true that amendments needed unanimous consent from states, this isn’t the *core* problem highlighted in the passage, which focuses on the lack of power to govern effectively.
* **C: kan memthelw alewlayh yefteqrewn ela alhedwer** (The representatives of the states lacked attendance) -  The passage mentions representatives being frequently absent *as a consequence* of the government’s weakness, not as the defining characteristic of the problem.
* **D: taleft alhekwemh alemrekzeyh men 3anesreyn r'eyesyeyn** (The central government lacked two key elements) - This is too broad. While the lack of executive and judicial branches are mentioned, the primary issue emphasized is the lack of power to enforce laws and collect taxes.

The text (P) explicitly states: ""Yudhher al-nnas fi al juzu2 min al mustanad maqluban"" (الناس في الجزء من المستند مقلوبان) which translates to ""The people in the part of the document appear upside down."" This refers to how the writing on the back of the Declaration of Independence appears.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: bekhet kebyer (بخط كبير - in large writing):** The text doesn't mention the *size* of the writing.
* **B: meshefrh (مشفرة - encrypted):** While it *looks* like a code in the movie, the text clarifies it's not a treasure map and doesn't state it's encrypted.
* **D: bekhet segheyr (بخط صغير - in small writing):**  Again, the size of the writing isn't mentioned.

teshether senghafewrh bay mema yely?,"The passage (P) discusses Singapore's transformation into a ""city in a garden"" and the selection of the Vanda Miss Joaquim orchid as the national flower. This clearly relates to **green spaces and horticulture**.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: alemsahat alekhedra' alhedreyh** (green spaces/gardens).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: aletnezh (tourism):** While gardens *attract* tourism, the passage focuses on the *creation* of the gardens themselves, not tourism as a result.
* **C: reyadat alemghamerh (underwater exploration):** This is completely unrelated to the content.
* **D: alefnewn alada'eyh (performing arts):** This also has no connection to the passage.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""... 2ukhtirat zahrat Nanda Miss Joaquim, wa hiya zahrat al Orchid al muhajjanah, li takun al zahra al wataniya lel bilad."" This translates to ""...Nanda Miss Joaquim flower, which is a hybrid Orchid flower, was chosen to be the national flower of the country.""
* **The question (Q) asks:** ""ma hey faneda meys jewkewyem?"" which translates to ""What is a species of plant?"" or more directly, ""What *kind of thing* is Nanda Miss Joaquim?"".
* The passage clearly identifies Nanda Miss Joaquim as a **zherh (flower)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: jezyerh (island):** While the passage mentions Singapore transforming the *island* into a garden city, Nanda Miss Joaquim isn't an island.
* **C: hedyeqh nebateyh (botanical garden):** The passage mentions Singapore's botanical expertise, but Nanda Miss Joaquim isn't a botanical garden.
* **D: nesb wetney (national emblem):** While the flower *became* a national emblem, the question asks *what it is* fundamentally – a flower.

* **The passage states:** ""…illa annahu lam yatim attafawuq 3ala ahramat Al-Giza min 7aythu al7ajm wa attamayuz alfani fi bina2iha.""  This translates to ""...however, there was no agreement on the pyramids of Giza in terms of **size** and artistic distinction in their construction.""
* **The question asks:** What aspect of the Giza pyramids wouldn't cause the ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom to marvel at their ancestors' work?
* The passage specifically says the *size* was so impressive it was astounding.  The other options are either things they *did* use (stone - B), are simply related to building (construction - D), or are irrelevant (age - A).

Therefore, the size of the pyramids is the element that would *not* be surprising, as it was the very thing that caused wonder.

(Then they return north across the west, again across the Mara River, after the rains in Naysan.)  This directly links the return journey *from* Naysan to the Serengeti region.  The wildebeest are returning *to* the Serengeti area after the rains in Naysan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: al suhul al janubiyya (the southern plains):** They *travel to* the southern plains, they don't depart *from* them after Naysan's rains.
* **C: nahr Mara (the Mara River):**  The Mara River is a crossing point, not a departure location.
* **D: ma7miyat Maasai Mara al wataniyya (Maasai Mara National Reserve):** While part of the ecosystem, the text doesn't say they leave *from* the Maasai Mara specifically after the Naysan rains, but return toward the Serengeti region.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: beryetaneya (Britain):** Britain was the *target* of the invasion, not the initiator.
*   **C: fernesa (France):** France had already fallen when this operation was planned.
*   **D: bewlenda (Poland):** Poland was invaded earlier, and this operation concerns a different conflict.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: dewnekyerk** - This is Dunkirk, the location of the British evacuation, not the name of the German operation.

* **B: bena' sefn edafeyh (building more ships):** The passage mentions Italy built 3 new ships *before* the war, but this isn't a step specifically to seize African countries – it's just preparation.
* **C: enesha' mensh etelaq aleqwat (establishing launch points for forces):** This is a *result* of controlling Egypt (to launch forces across the Mediterranean), not a step *to* control Egypt.

(The main Italian goals were in the African countries. To control these countries...).  The entire plan outlined revolves around gaining control of African nations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: bena' jeysh webheryh aqewa (building a stronger army and navy):** While Italy *did* build some ships, the passage notes their army and navy were weak to begin with, and building ships was *to facilitate* the main goal, not the goal itself.

These are the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting them.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: alalman** (the Germans) - The text describes the French government *cooperating* with the Germans, not the Germans themselves having relationships with invaders.
*   **C: alameryekywn** (the Americans) - The text says the Americans *liberated* Southern France, working *against* the invaders.
*   **D: hekwemh fernesa alherh** (the free French government) - The text explicitly contrasts this government with the fascist one, stating they fought *with* the Americans to liberate France.

The passage explicitly states: ""عندما بدأ الرادار في الظهور وأصبح أكثر دقة، اضطرت الغواصات إلى الغوص تحت الماء لتجنب رؤيتها."" (When radar began to appear and became more accurate, submarines were forced to dive underwater to avoid being seen.)

This directly links the development of radar to a change in submarine tactics - they began to submerge to avoid detection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: U-Boates:** U-boats were *used* by Germany, but weren't a *development* that caused changes in submarine technology.
*   **B: meda etelaq alenar (range of fire):** While limited range was mentioned, it wasn't the driving force behind technological changes.

The text states: ""Fi dhalika al waqet kanu yattasimun bil bu6u2 al shadid **wa kana nitaq ar-rimaya ma7dudan lil ghaya**."" 

This translates to: ""At that time, they were characterized by their slow speed **and the firing range was very limited**.""

* **A: alemlahh (navigation):** While submarines *need* navigation, the text doesn't mention its limitation as a characteristic of early submarines.
* **B: alesfer (travel):** The text *does* mention slow speed (alesfer bat'i2), but the specific limitation mentioned is the firing range.

The passage explicitly states that over 800,000 soldiers of the **""aljaysh al a7mar lil iti7ad alsovieti""** (the Red Army of the Soviet Union) entered Poland.  It also mentions the violation of a Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact (""mithaq 3adm al i3tida2 alsoveiti alpolandi""). 

Therefore, the passage clearly identifies the Soviet Union as the party violating agreements.



"

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the Red Army's invasion of Poland was ""in violation of the Treaty of Riga for peace, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, bilateral and multilateral.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: enesha' jebhh awekraneyh (establishing the Ukrainian front):** The passage *states* they created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts – they *did* this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: tem aleqbed 3aleh fi hesn Capuzzo** (He was captured in Fort Capuzzo) - While the British captured a fort, it doesn't say Lastucci was captured *at* Capuzzo, but rather east of Bardia.
*   **B: qetl fi Tobruk** (He was killed in Tobruk) - The text states Marshal Balbo was killed in Tobruk, not General Lastucci.
*   **D: qetl benyeran sedyeqh** (He was killed by friendly fire) - Again, this refers to Marshal Balbo, not General Lastucci.



"

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...wa attakhayulat (and visualizations)."" It's part of how *kundalini yoga* (a core component of the therapeutic bodywork) awakens *kundalini* energy.  The passage focuses on using imagination and visualization as a method within the practice.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: memaresh temareyn aletnefs (practicing breathing exercises):** While *tanfous* (breathing) is mentioned, it's presented *as part of* the overall process alongside other elements, not the defining technique.
*   **B: tekrar aletraneym (repeating exercises):** Repetition isn't specifically highlighted as the central technique.
*   **D: eteqan wed'eyat aleyweja (mastering yoga poses):** Yoga is mentioned (Kundalini yoga), but the passage emphasizes energy awakening through visualization and other internal practices rather than physical postures alone.



Therefore, **tekheyl alalhh (visualization/imagination)** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: eber tekheyl alalhh** (عبر تخيل الإله - through imagining the deity): While visualization is *part* of the process, the text specifically mentions *embodiment*, which is a more active and engaged practice than simply imagining.
* **C: tekrar aletraneym** (تكرار الترانيم - repetition of mantras):  The text mentions *taghani* (تغاني - chanting) as part of Kundalini yoga, but doesn't state it's *how* the chakras are activated specifically.
* **D: memaresh temareyn aletnefs** (ممارسة تمارين التنفس - practicing breathing exercises): Breathing exercises (*tamarin attanafus*) are mentioned as a way to awaken Kundalini energy, but not as the direct method for activating the chakras themselves.



Therefore, the text directly links chakra activation to embodying different deities."

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bada2 al-mughany Sangu Sharma fi al-masa2 yaleihi **Gay Shankar Tshudary**."" (The singer Sangu Sharma started, followed by Jai Shankar Choudhary).

(Lakkha Singh presented the Chhappan Bhog offering and was accompanied by singer Raju Khandelwal.)  This clearly indicates Lakkha Singh presented something *after* the devotional songs were sung and *as part of* the offerings to Baba Shyam, making him the one who presented after the songs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jai Shankar Choudhary:** He was a singer *during* the devotional songs, not after the songs were over presenting the food.
*   **C: Shri Shyam:**  Shri Shyam is the deity *receiving* the offering, not the presenter.

This directly identifies these three as the performers *before* the final performance of ""Nar al-Anadol.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Neyran alanadewl (Nar al-Anadol)**: This is the name of the Turkish dance troupe and their final performance, not a performance *before* it.
*   **C: aleraqeswen aleswefyewn (The Sufi Dervishes)**: They performed *before* Aksu, Safina, and Alexiou.
*   **D: fath erekwesh wemselm jewresyes (Fatih Erkwatsh wa Muslwm Ghwrsys)**: They were mentioned as being present at the orchestra, not as performers *on* stage before Aksu, Safina and Alexiou.

This translates to ""...the electricity was cut off immediately, which prevented the authorities in Tonga, according to what was circulated in the media, from receiving a tsunami warning issued by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aubelgh 3an b3d aladerar** (Some damage was reported) - While a tsunami *was* detected nearby, the passage explicitly states no damage or injuries were reported *in Tonga*.
* **B: lem tetleq alesletat aneba' beshan alethedyerat alemrefw'eh** (The authorities did not announce anything about the warnings) - The issue wasn’t a lack of announcement, but an inability to *receive* the warnings.
* **C: tathert qera'at mestewa seth alebher** (Sea level readings were affected) - While sea level readings are mentioned in the context of the tsunami, the question asks specifically about Tonga's situation.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Wa tamakant al-shorta min dabet sor3at al-sayed Reid li mara wa7ida 3endama khafafa sur3atuhu ila 160 kilometer bi-sa3a.""  This translates to: ""And the police were able to determine Mr. Reid's speed only once when he slowed down to 160 kilometers per hour.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: fi alemrh alesab'eh lh fewq alejser** (in the seventh run on the bridge) - The text doesn't specify *when* they were able to get a reading, only *at what speed*.
* **C: 3anedma kan yeqwed seyareth besr'eh tezyed 3an 160 kem/sa'eh** (when he was driving the car at a speed exceeding 160 km/h) - The text explicitly says they couldn't get a reading at higher speeds due to the car's low profile.
* **D: fi awel merh lh 3la alejser** (in the first run on the bridge) - The text doesn't mention anything about the first run.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Wajahat al-shorta al-nyuzalandiyya mushkilatan fi istikhdam banadeq al-radar al-sari3a li ma3rifat mada al-sur3a al-lati yasir biha Reid bi-sabab **inkhifad mustawa sayarat Balck Beauty**.""  This directly translates to ""The New Zealand police faced a problem using fast radar guns to determine Reid's speed because **of the low level of the Black Beauty car**."" 

The low ground clearance of the car interfered with the radar guns' ability to accurately measure the speed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: kan yeqwed seyareth besr'eh aqel men 160 kem/sa'eh** (He was driving the car at a speed less than 160 km/h) - The passage says he *exceeded* 160 km/h multiple times, and was recorded at 160 km/h *when he slowed down*.
*   **C: qad seyareth 'eber alejser seb' merat feqt** (He drove the car across the bridge three times) -  While true, this doesn't explain the difficulty in *recording* his speed.
*   **D: jesr meyna' aweklaned qedyem jedaan** (The Auckland bridge is very old) - The age of the bridge isn't mentioned as a factor in the difficulty of recording his speed.



"
ayen temrekz alezlezal balensebh le Butte?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 meyla jenwebaan** (40 miles south).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kana markaz azilzal 3ala bu3ud 65 km (40 mil) 3ala bu3ud janub Buttle.""  This translates to ""The epicenter of the earthquake was 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of Butte."""
mada hedth khelal a'emal aleshegheb fi abew gheryeb?,"The correct answer is **D: adermet alenyeran fi alesjen** (fires were set in the prison).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) states:** ""2u'9rimat al-niran fi sijn 2abu '3rib al-3ira8i..."" - This directly translates to ""Fires were set in Abu Ghraib prison...""
* **Q (the question) asks:** ""What happened during the riots in Abu Ghraib?""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: esa'h ma3eamelh alesjena'** (What the prisoners did) - While prisoner mistreatment is *mentioned* as a cause for the unrest, the passage focuses on the *result* - the fires.
* **B: eghelaq** (closure) - The passage doesn't mention the prison being closed.
* **C: seytert aleqwat alameryekyh** (American forces took control) - This happened *before* the riots, not *during* them. The passage states the riots happened *after* the Americans took control.



Therefore, **D** is the most direct and accurate answer based on the information provided in passage P."
lemaza aketseb alesjen al'eraqey sema3eh sey'eh? ,"The correct answer is **D: aketshaf esa'h ma3eamelh alesjena'** (discoveries of bad treatment within the prison).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""...ba3da iktishaf sou2 mu3amalat al-sujuna2..."" (after discovering bad treatment of prisoners). This directly links the prison's bad reputation to the uncovering of abuse.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: adermet feyh alenyeran (damage in it by fire):** While the passage mentions fires (""niran""), it doesn't say that *damage from fire* caused the bad reputation. The fires are *in* the prison, not the *cause* of its reputation.
* **B: tewlet aleqwat alameryekyh alesyetrh (the American forces controlled):** The passage states American forces *took over control*, but doesn't state that their control *caused* the bad reputation. It was the *discovery of abuse* after the takeover that led to the negative perception.
* **C: kanet henak al3adid men a'emal aleshegheb (there were many acts of rioting):**  The passage mentions ""a3mal 4a'3ab"" (punitive actions/severe acts), but doesn't specify rioting.  The primary issue is the treatment of prisoners.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage."

* This clearly indicates the event was a concert (""3ard"" translates to performance/show/concert) taking place in Maui.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ered shery (a police inquiry):** The text doesn't mention any police involvement or investigation.
* **B: mebarah kerh qedm (an old football match):** The text mentions a performance, not a football match.
* **D: heflh jema3 aletber'eat (a charity fundraising event):** While possible, the text doesn't indicate a charitable purpose for the event.  It's simply described as a performance with a large expected audience.



"

Here's why:

The text states that HK Management, the band's management company, *initially* didn't provide a reason for the cancellation, but *then* explained it was due to logistical reasons the next day.  Therefore, they are the ones who eventually provided an explanation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: alefreqh alemwesyeqyh** (the musical group/band) - They apologized to the audience, but didn't *explain* the cancellation initially.
* **C: malek esetad alherb aletdekarey** (the owner of the memorial arena) - The text doesn't mention them providing an explanation.
* **D: alema3ejebwen** (the fans) - They *received* the apology but didn't offer an explanation.

The passage states: ""La8ad al8a al-3adyd min sukkan Byshkyk billawm 3ala al-muta'6ahiryn min al-janub fy a3mal al-fw'9a walkhuruj 3ala al-8anon.""  This translates to: ""Many residents of Bishkek blamed the migrants from the south for acts of chaos and violating the law.""

Therefore, the residents of Bishkek believe the **teenagers/youth** are responsible for the looting.



"

The text explicitly states: ""La8ad al8a al-3adyd min sukkan Byshkyk billawm 3ala al-muta'6ahiryn min al-janub fy a3mal al-fw'9a walkhuruj 3ala al-8anon.""  This translates to: ""Many residents of Bishkek blamed the migrants from the south for acts of chaos and violating the law.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: debat enefad aleqanewn** (Law enforcement) - The text mentions their *absence* contributing to the problem, not blaming.
* **C: alefwedweyyen** (The observers) - The observers *described* the situation, they didn't place blame.
* **D: esabat men alenas** (Groups of people) - These groups *committed* the robbery, they weren't blaming anyone.

The text explicitly states: ""Wa qala assayed Siminoff inna nisbat al-mabi3at qad zdadat ba3da dhuhurihi fi 7alaka li barnamej Shark Tank..."" (And Mr. Siminoff said that the sales percentage increased after his appearance on the Shark Tank program...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: b3d tameyn aletmewyel fi 3am 2013** (after receiving funding in 2013) - The text states the team *rejected* funding in 2013.
* **C: b3d zhewrha 3la QVC** (after its appearance on QVC) - While Siminoff appeared on QVC, the text doesn't link that appearance to an increase in sales.
* **D: b3d tesweyh d'ewa qeda'eyh ma3 ADT** (after settling the lawsuit with ADT) - The text mentions the settlement, but doesn't state it led to increased sales.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ashara assayed Jamie Siminoff, arra2is atanfizi li sharikat Ring, ila anna asharika intalakt 3endma la7adha anna jaras babihi ghayr masmu3 min matjarihi fi mir2ab manzilihi.""  This translates to: ""Jamie Siminoff, the founder of Ring, mentioned that his company launched when he noticed his doorbell wasn't heard from his store in his home garage."" 

This directly indicates the company started *because* he realized his doorbell wasn't good enough.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: b3d zhewr fashel 3la Shark Tank** (after appearing and failing on Shark Tank) - While he *appeared* on Shark Tank, the text says they *rejected* funding, not that it was a failure that prompted the start of Ring.  The company had already begun.
* **C: b3d tameyn aletmewyel** (after securing funding) - The text specifically states funding was *rejected* on Shark Tank.
* **D: b3d zhewr najh 3la QVC** (after appearing successfully on QVC) -  His appearance on QVC was *after* the company was already running, not the initial reason for starting it.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Wa sawfa yuqaddimu kul 3ared tawsiyatin li kutubin yab7athu 3anha al-atfal fi al-maktabat.""  This translates to: ""And each show will present a recommendation for books to search for children in libraries.""

Therefore, each episode of Reading Rainbow recommended books to children.

This translates to: ""Some believe, including John Grant, that **the funding crisis** and a shift in the philosophy of educational television programs led to the cancellation of the series.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 3dm wejwed jewa'ez Emmy (lack of Emmy awards):** The passage states the show *won* over 20 Emmy awards, so this isn't the reason for its cancellation.
* **C: ray John Grant (John Grant's opinion):** While John Grant is mentioned, the passage states his opinion *is* that funding was the problem, not that his opinion *caused* the cancellation.
* **D: nejah Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood (success of Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood):** The passage simply mentions that *Reading Rainbow* aired for a shorter time than *Sesame Street* and *Mister Rogers' Neighborhood*, it doesn't suggest the latter's success caused the former's downfall.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""wa tushakilu khataran 3ala al-si7a al-3amma"" (and it poses a danger to public health). This is a direct match.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sewf tesqet hetmaan** (It will definitely fall) - While the passage mentions it was *almost* falling, it doesn't state it *will* fall definitively.  The court order prevented its immediate removal, suggesting uncertainty about its imminent collapse.
* **B: yejb al7efaz 3aleha** (It must be preserved) - The passage focuses on the danger it poses, not on preserving it.  The initial plan was to *cut it down*.
* **C: anha melwethh balefteryat** (It is infected with fungi) - The passage states ""musaba bi-da2 al-fitir"" (infected with a fungal disease), but the question asks what the official was informing the museum *about*. The danger to public health is the key information conveyed.

Here's why:

The text states David O'Shannessy believes ""muraqabat wa taftish al-masale5 yajeb an takuna amran sha2i3an fi Australia"" (monitoring and inspection of facilities should be commonplace in Australia). He specifically links this to sending ""al-dawa2ir al-talfizywniya al-mu'3la8a"" (CCTV cameras) to those working with animals.  This makes CCTV cameras the direct object of the required commonplace practice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: أي شخص يعمل مع الحيوانات (ay shakhs ya3mal ma3 al-7ayawanat - any person working with animals):** While the cameras *monitor* people working with animals, the practice isn't just about the people themselves, but about *observing* their work.
* **C: تركيبات المراقبة (tarkybat al-muraqabah - monitoring installations):** This is too broad. The text specifically mentions *cameras*.
* **D: المسالك (al-masalekh - facilities):**  The facilities are *where* the monitoring happens, but the monitoring itself is the key practice.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the RSPCA is pushing for **mandatory CCTV cameras in all Australian slaughterhouses**.  David O'Shannessy believes monitoring and inspection should be commonplace, and the cameras will send a strong message to those working with animals that welfare is the highest priority.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: alajetma'eat alelezameyh ma3 alejma3eyh alemlekyh lemn' aleqsewh 3la alheywanat (RSPCA)** - While the RSPCA is *advocating* for change, they aren't the tool to solidify the importance of animal welfare itself. They are the organization *doing* the advocating.
* **C: 3malyat tefteysh alemsalekh alemtekrerh (repeated slaughterhouse inspections)** -  The passage mentions inspections, but the *cameras* are presented as the key to making monitoring and inspection more commonplace and effective.
* **D: alerqabh men ABC (monitoring from ABC)** - ABC is just reporting on the story; they aren’t the method for establishing the importance of animal welfare.

"wefqaan llfqrh, ma hey mhenh aleshekhes aledy tem a'eteqalh?","The correct answer is **A: taleb (student)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""tamma i3tiqal talib akhar fi ma yata3allaq bi-itlaq annar 3ala al-madrasa"" which translates to ""another **student** was arrested in connection with the school shooting.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: shefy leda sheyfh meyneyabewleys setar teryebyewn:** This is gibberish and doesn't relate to the text.
*   **C: r'eyes qebley:** This translates to ""former president"" and is not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: selth fi alebheyrh alhemra':** This translates to ""authority in the red lake"" and is not the identity of the arrested person.

"wefqaan llfqrh, beynema kanet alakhebar tentesher 3an a'eteqal akher, aqeymet jenazat lekm men aledhaya ?","The correct answer is **B: thelathh (three)**.

The text states: ""حيثُ تمّ تشييع جنازة Jeff Weise و ثلاثة من الضحايا التسعة"" which translates to ""where the funeral of Jeff Weise and three of the nine victims took place."" 

Therefore, the funerals were held for Jeff Weise and three victims.

"redaan 3la alahetjajat, ay dewlh lm temdey qedmaan fi atefaqeyh mekafhh aletzeyyef aletjareyh alemweq'eh ?","The correct answer is **B: Bolanda (Poland)**.

This translates to: ""There were large protests in Poland last month when that country signed an agreement to combat trade circumvention, which led the Polish government to decide not to ratify the agreement, currently.""

This indicates Poland *did* initially move forward with the agreement (signed it) but then *rejected* it due to protests. The question asks which country *did not proceed* with the agreement, and Poland fits that description.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Almaneya (Germany):** The text only mentions protests *in* Germany, not a rejection of the agreement.
*   **C: Eskotlanda (Scotland):**  Protests happened in Scotland, but the text doesn't mention its government's stance on the agreement.
*   **D: Leythewaneya (Lithuania):** The text states Lithuania ""arja2at 3amaliyat al-endimam ila etifaqiyat mukafa7at attazwir attijari"" - meaning it *postponed* joining the agreement, not completely rejected it like Poland.

The text states: ""Laqad arja2at kul min Latvya wa Slovakya 3amaliyat al-endimam ila etifaqiyat mukafa7at attazwir attijari."" which translates to ""Both Latvia and Slovakia postponed the process of joining the agreement on combating commercial forgeries.""

Therefore, Latvia is one of the countries that postponed its accession to the agreement.



"

Here's why:

The text states: ""...tarik arba3at ashkhas ma3a 7uruq 6afifa"" which translates to ""...left four people with minor burns."" 

Therefore, four people were injured as a result of the overheating incidents.



"

Here's why:

The text states: ""...واصفها الشركة بأنها ''غير خطيرة.'' (…described them as ''not dangerous.'')"". This clearly indicates that **Apple** was the one who stated the overheating incidents were ""not dangerous.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: وزارة الاقتصاد والتجارة والصناعة اليابانية (METI)** - METI reported the incidents and requested clarification from Apple, they did *not* say the incidents were not dangerous.
*   **B: مالك أي بود للمتأثرين** - This translates to ""owner of any iPod affected"" - irrelevant to the question.
*   **C: إدارة الدفاع اليابانية** - Japanese Defense Management - completely unrelated.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: aletareykh (history)** - While he says they will *make* history, he doesn't say Apple will *invent* history.
*   **C: ales7erkh (the stage)** - The speech was *on* the stage, but he didn't say they'd invent it.
*   **D: aletkenweljejya (the technology)** - He's specifically talking about reinventing the *phone* itself, not just the technology in general.



"

Here's why:

The text states (translated): ""Jobs frankly stated during his two-hour speech that today he would reinvent the phone and we would make history today."" This clearly indicates the speech was about launching a new phone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: etelaq jhaz lewhey jedyed (launch of a new tablet):** The text specifically mentions *reinventing the phone*, not a tablet.
* **B: etelaq hasewb jedyed (launch of a new computer):**  Again, the focus is on the *phone*.
* **D: ale3lan 3an teqa'edh (announcement of retirement):** The text describes a product launch, not a retirement announcement.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Wa a3lanat al-sayida Krichner 3azmaha al-tarashu7 lil-ri2asa..."" (And Mrs. Kirchner announced her determination to run for the presidency...)
* This directly translates to her announcing her *candidacy* for president.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: neytha aletreshh lemjels alesheywekh (her candidacy for the Senate)** - While she *previously* ran for the Senate in 2005, the passage focuses on her *current* announcement, which is for the presidency.
* **C: hemletha lewfed meqat'eh Buenos Aires (her membership in the Buenos Aires province delegation)** - This is a detail about her past, not what she announced.
* **D: khettha leltenhey 3an mensebha k'edew haley fi mejles alesheywekh (her intention to resign from her current position in the Senate)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about resigning.



"
ayen a'elent Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner 3an neytha aletreshh?,"The correct answer is **B: fi mesrh bewyens ayers fi La Plata**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Wa a3lanat al-sayida Krichner 3azmaha al-tarashu7 lil-ri2asa fil al-masra7 al-arjentini wa huwa nafes al-makan al-ladhi kanat tabda2 fihi 7amlatiha al-intikhabiyya 3am 2005 li majles al-shuyukh..."" (And Ms. Kirchner announced her determination to run for president on the Argentine stage, which is the same place where she began her campaign in 2005 for the Senate...)
* **The text also states:** ""...fi madinat La Plata, al-lati taqa3 3ala bu3ud 50 kilometran (31 milan) min al-3asima Buenos Aires."" (in the city of La Plata, which is located 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the capital Buenos Aires.)

Therefore, she announced her candidacy on a stage in La Plata. Option B is the closest and most accurate translation.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** ""fi mesrh 3la b3d 31 meylaan men La Plata"" -  Incorrect, it says the stage is *in* La Plata, not 31 miles *from* it.
*   **C:** ""fi alemserh alarejnetyeny 3la b3d 31 meylaan men Buenos Aires"" - Incorrect, it's 31 miles from Buenos Aires, not the stage's location.
*   **D:** ""fi mesrh labelata fi Buenos Aires"" - Incorrect, the announcement took place in La Plata, not Buenos Aires.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""…lam yantahik Big Brother qawanin arraqaba…haythu lam yatim takhzin al-wasa2et 3ala mawqe3 Big Brother."" (Big Brother did not violate censorship laws…because the media was not stored on the Big Brother website.)
* **The core issue:**  The ACMA determined there was no violation *because* the video wasn't hosted/stored on Big Brother's server.  This is the key factor.
* **Why the other options are wrong:**
    * **A & C (laws were/weren't violated):** While the conclusion is no violation, the *reason* is crucial, and it hinges on storage.
    * **D (content existed on a server):** The passage explicitly says the content was *not* on Big Brother’s server.



Therefore, the result of the ACMA's investigation hinges on whether the content was stored on Big Brother's website."

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ولكن لي كي يتم اعتباره كمحتوى إنترنت، يجب أن يكون موجودًا فعليًا على السيرفر (But for it to be considered internet content, it must be physically present on the server).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: yejb an yetm bethha 3la alenetrent (it must be broadcast on the internet)** - Broadcasting isn't enough; it needs to be *stored* on a server.
* **C: la yemken tekhezyenha 3la mewq' weyb (it cannot be stored on a website)** - This is the opposite of what the passage states.  It *needs* to be on a server (which a website uses).
* **D: yejb an tetm alemwafeqh 3aleha men qebl hey'eh alatesalat wale3lam alasetraleyh (it must be approved by the Australian Communications and Media Authority)** -  The passage doesn’t mention approval; it focuses on *where* the content is stored.



"
men hew z'eyem alhezb alelyebraley alasetraley?,"The correct answer is **B: John Howard**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ومن المرّجح أن يخلف السيد كوستيلو رئيس الوزراء جون هوارد كزعيم للحزب الليبرالي."" This translates to ""It is likely that Mr. Costello will succeed Prime Minister John Howard as leader of the Liberal Party."" 

Therefore, John Howard is the current leader of the Liberal Party (at the time of this text), and Costello is expected to *become* the leader.



"
lemaza la temtelk asetraleya balef'el sena'eh taqh newweyh?,"The text doesn't directly state *why* Australia doesn't currently have a nuclear power industry. However, it focuses on Peter Costello saying Australia *should* pursue it **if** it becomes economically viable and available for purchase. This implies the current barrier isn't necessarily ideological (""methyrh leljedl lelghayh"" - a controversy for no reason) or dangerous (""khetyerh lelghayh"" - it's dangerous) or expensive (""meklefh lelghayh"" - it's expensive).

The most logical inference, given the context, is that it's currently not economically feasible.  While not explicitly stated, the conditional nature of Costello’s support (""if it becomes economically viable..."") points towards a lack of economic justification *currently*.

Therefore, the best answer is:

**A: alafetqar leld'em al3am (lack of public demand)**

While not a perfect fit, ""lack of public demand"" often correlates with economic viability - if there's no perceived economic benefit, there won't be demand. The text hints that until nuclear power becomes affordable and available, there's no reason to pursue it.



"

The text states: ""I7talla al-mutazaliju Al-bolandy Masyj Kryzil **wa ana Awgharzynska** al-markaz athalith 3shar fy siba8 Suber Ji.""  This translates to ""The Polish skiers Maciej Kryzel **and Anna Ogarzynska** finished 13th in the Super-G race.""

This indicates Anna Ogarzynska is a skier competing in the race, therefore a competitor with a guide. The question asks for a skier who competes *with a guide* ( مساعدة مرشد )."
ay dewlh ahetlet alemrekz al'easher fi betwelh sewber jey lef'eh alensa' fi wed' alewqewf?,"The correct answer is **B: 7wlenda (Holland)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Shamalat Holanda idh 7talat Anna al-markaz 9 al-ames fi butulat Super-G, wa Katja Saarinen min Filanda bi nafis al-markaz."" This translates to: ""Including Holland, as Anna took 9th place in the Super-G championship, and Katja Saarinen from Finland took the same place.""

While Finland also had a competitor in 9th place, the question asks which country *held* the 9th place. The text specifically states Holland (7wlenda) did.

"wefqaan llfqrh, ay jemlh jewl Blake leyset deqyeqh?","The correct answer is **C: asetkhedm 'emewd athena' alhejwem** (he used a pillar to defend against the attack).

Here's why:

The passage states Blake *claimed* he used the pillar to defend himself from glass being thrown at him by 30 people. However, he was *convicted* of obstructing justice. This implies his claim was not believed and was likely false.  The passage doesn't state he *actually* used the pillar, only that he *claimed* to have done so.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: aleqy aleqbed 3aleh fi mekan alhadeth** (he was arrested at the scene of the crime) - The passage explicitly states he was arrested at the scene.
*   **B: a'eterf balhejwem** (he confessed to the attack) - The passage does *not* say he confessed to the attack, it says he was arrested at the scene *of* the attack.
*   **D: ad'ea an alezjajat aleqyet 3aleh** (he claimed glass was thrown at him) - He *did* claim glass was thrown at him, this part of his statement isn't necessarily false (though likely a justification for his actions).



"
"bena'an 3la alfqrh, ay mema yely lm yhedth lebleyk?","The correct answer is **A: adeyn bethemh e'eaqh mesar al'edalh** (He was convicted of obstructing justice).

Here's why:

The text (P) states: ""Wa tammat idanat Blake bi annahu yu3arqil masar al-3adala."" This translates to ""And Blake was convicted of obstructing the course of justice.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: aleqy aleqbed 3aleh** (He was arrested) - The text mentions someone *else* being arrested at the scene of the crime (al-mudhi3).
* **C: t'ered lelhejwem b'emewd** (He threatened the crowd with a pole) - The text says he *used* the pole to defend himself, not to threaten.
* **D: qeyl lh enh men alemhetmel an yuresl ela alesjen** (He was told he was likely to be sent to prison) - While the judge said the matter was ""almost certain"" to result in prison, the core fact is his conviction for obstructing justice.

ma aledy len yestekhedm feyh sendewq alahetbas alherarey aletab' lel-umam al-muta7ida?,"The correct answer is **A: tanwi3 al-ma7asil (diversifying sources of income)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Yumkin an tatawajjah al-amwal ila bina2 manzil muqawima lil fayadanat, wa ila idara afdal lil miyah, **wa tanwi3 al-ma7asil**."" (The funds can go towards building disaster-resistant housing, better water management, **and diversifying income sources**.)

This clearly indicates that diversifying income sources is *one* of the ways the funds from the United Nations' appeal will be used.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: jelb al-ta8niyat limusa3adit adduwal annamiya (bringing coordination to assist developing countries):** This describes the *purpose* of the appeal, not *how* the funds will be spent.
*   **C: manzil muqawima lil fayadanat (disaster-resistant housing):**  This is *an* example of how the funds might be used, but not the sole focus.
*   **D: aletkhefyef men athar al-27tibas al-7arary al'ealemy (reducing the effects of global climate change):**  The text says the funds are to help with the *impacts* of climate change (like floods), but not specifically to mitigate climate change itself.

The text (P) explicitly states: ""Tarnw al-umam al-muta7ida ela wa'93 al-lamsat al-akhira 3ala attamwyl limusa3aditi al-duwal al-muta'9rira min '6ahirati al-27tibas al-7arary 3ala atta3amul ma3 athariha.""  This translates to: ""The United Nations is putting the final touches on funding to help countries affected by the consequences of climate change to deal with its effects.""

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: alemal, men khelal mesharekh aletkenwelwejya** (the world, through developmental projects) - While the UN *facilitates* developmental projects, the text focuses on *which* countries receive help, not the mechanism of help.
* **B: alemhaseyl** (the current situation) - This is too broad. The text isn't about the general current situation, but a specific aid effort.
* **D: alashekhas alemtedrerwen men sew' edarh alemyah** (people affected by bad global management) - This is a misinterpretation. The text specifically links the need for aid to *climate change* impacts, not generalized ""bad management.""



Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."

This translates to: ""We have not yet reached an agreement on **rules of origin** and tariff sessions, but the work we have adopted is enough to begin trade on July 1, 2020.""

Albert Mushinga explicitly states that an agreement on rules of origin is *still pending*.  The other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Nigeria's intention to join is *already* announced.
* **B:** The date trade can start is mentioned (July 1, 2020) - it's not something still needing agreement.
* **D:** Details about the African Union's duties aren't mentioned as something still being negotiated.

This translates to: ""We haven't yet reached an agreement on rules of origin and tariff schedules, **but the work we've adopted is sufficient to begin trading on July 1st, 2020.**""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While Nigeria's announcement *includes* a July date, the reason for the date isn't simply because of Nigeria's commitment. It's because of existing work.
* **C:** Agreement from the trade representative is a factor, but doesn't explain *why* trading can begin.
* **D:** The text *specifically states* they haven't agreed on the rules of origin and tariff schedules.

Here's why:

The passage states the *Atlanta Journal-Constitution* report showed test scores increased rapidly and *claimed* the school discovered internal problems but didn't take action on the results. This directly corresponds to option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aletla'eb betqeryer Jourenal-Conestitution** (Playing with the Jourenal-Constitution report) - While the passage *implies* manipulation of test scores, it doesn't say the *newspaper* was played with.
* **B: alefshel fi alta3lem alhedrey alembetker** (Failure in innovative urban education) - The passage mentions she was *recognized* for innovative urban education, not failing at it.
* **D: alebelagh 3an derjat akhetbar menkhefdh** (Reporting on low test scores) - The report actually showed *increased* test scores, and then questioned the validity of those increases.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Hall received the award in 2009**, not 2013. It mentions improved test scores *at the time* of the award, but doesn't discuss *why* she received the award.
* **A: thesn derjh alakhetbar gheyr al'eadey** (unusually high test scores) - This *is* mentioned in the text (""darajat al-ikhtibar qad zadat bi-sur3a ha2ila"").

(And some reports indicated that the death toll reached 8 people, and official reports stated that the number of injuries reached 30...)

This directly relates to the official death toll. Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: al3dd alenha'ey lelesabat:** The passage doesn't give a *final* number of victims, only estimates.
* **B: ay mebanen anefjert aleqnabel baleqreb menha:** While it says bombs exploded *near* government buildings, it doesn't specify *which* buildings.
* **C: eda tem tefjeyr qenabel edafeyh:** The passage states three bombs exploded, but doesn’t mention if there were more.

Therefore, the answer to the question ""since joining Manchester City in 2017, how many matches has Jesus played?"" is 53.

This directly translates to: ""Jesus, aged 21, joined Manchester City last year in December 2017 **from the Brazilian club Palmeiras** in exchange for an amount of 27 million pounds sterling.""

Therefore, Palmeiras is the club Jesus came *from* for the transfer fee of 27 million pounds."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kan aledyewf fi mekh lada' feryedh alhej** (the guest was in a tent near the pilgrimage) - The passage doesn't mention tents or being near the pilgrimage specifically.
* **B: b3d aledyewf leysewa mewatenyen mhelyeyn** (some guests were not Emirati citizens) - While *some* might not have been, the passage explicitly states *most* were.
* **C: kan aledyewf henak 'esheyh alhej** (the guest was there for the pilgrimage) - This isn't incorrect, but it doesn't answer the question of *who* the guests were. The passage states they were visiting the Haram in anticipation of the Hajj, but doesn't define them *as* pilgrims.

* **The passage states:** ""Wasalat 7asilat al-mawta ila 15 3ala al-aqal"" which translates to ""The death toll reached 15 at least.""  However, the question asks what the passage states *didn't* happen.  Since the passage *does* mention deaths, options C and D are incorrect as they state facts *in* the passage. Option B is incorrect as the passage states most guests were Emirati citizens, not all Arab citizens.
* **The question asks:** ""wefqaan llfqrh, ay men alejmel atalyh sheyh?"" which translates to ""According to the paragraph, what didn't happen?"".

* **The passage focuses on tracking the debris (anqad) from the explosion.** It states the US Strategic Command is tracking the debris and a tactical analysis will be published on a website. This is the main piece of information *about* the explosion beyond the basic facts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: hejm alasetdam (size of the explosion):** The passage mentions the size (over a thousand jewels) but doesn't elaborate on its scale beyond that. It focuses on the *consequences* of the explosion, not its intrinsic size.
* **B: mewq' alasetdam (location of the explosion):** The passage states the explosion happened ""on a rise 491 miles above the earth"" but doesn't provide any further detail about its exact location.
* **C: tatheyr alasetdam 3la alared (the explosion's effect on Earth):** The passage mentions scientists are *trying to determine* the effect on Earth, but doesn’t *state* what the effect is. It's a future investigation, not a current fact.

This translates to ""And they are still seeking to know the extent of this explosion and how it will affect the Earth.""  This directly relates to dealing with the consequences of the collision.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: meda ser'eh seyr alaqemar alesna'eyh weqt alasetdam** (what is the speed of the artificial satellite during the collision) - The passage *gives* the speed (17,500 miles per hour), it doesn't say they are still trying to figure it out.

The text states ""I7talla Batten al-martaba 190 fi qa2imat aghna 400 amrikiyyan..."" which translates to ""Batten ranked 190 on the list of the 400 richest Americans...""  This directly indicates he's notable because of his position on that list.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: jama3eh Virginia (Virginia community)** - While he was honored by the University of Virginia, the text doesn't say he's primarily known *to* the Virginia community.
* **C: 3dd kebyer men alema3esesat (a large number of institutions)** - The text only mentions one institution, the University of Virginia.

* **The passage states:** ""...ويعاقب على بائعها بغرامة قدرها 1000 $ لكل جريمة"" (and the seller will be penalized with a fine of $1000 for each offense). This directly translates to financial penalties for those who violate the law.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: hezr bey' aw tajeyr al'eab alefyedyew al3aneyfh lelqesr fi jami3 anha' California** (banning the sale or rental of violent video games to minors in all of California) - While the law *does* ban sales to minors, the question asks what is *part of* the law, and the penalties are a distinct component.
* **C: hezr bey' aw tajeyr al'eab alefyedyew al3aneyfh lelqesr kharej California** (banning the sale or rental of violent video games to minors outside California) - The law only applies *within* California.
* **D: ashetrat wed' melseq 3la alal'eab al3aneyfh** (requiring a label on violent games) - The passage mentions a label (""18""), but the penalties *for selling to minors* are a separate and crucial part of the law.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

This translates to: ""Layton requested changes to the draft environmental protection law during the meeting with the Prime Minister, also demanding a new, complete and comprehensive formulation of the party's draft law for environmental protection.""

Therefore, Jack Layton is the one who proposed changes to the environmental law (which is related to ""qanun al-hwa2 al-nathif"" - clean air law, as it's a component of environmental protection).

This clearly indicates that the *state government* was critical of the federal government's actions (funding the hospital) and viewed it as politically motivated before the elections.

The passage states the researcher used FTIR analysis to **compare** the precipitate (bilawrat) found in the cat's urine to the precipitate found in the urine of affected animals.  FTIR is a spectral analysis technique used to identify the *composition* of substances, in this case, the precipitate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

The text states: ""3allaqa Dustin """"Goldust"""" Runnels qa2elan :"""" Luna kanat gharibat al-atwar mithli… wa rubbama akthar… 2u7ebbuha wa sawfa 2aftaqiduha… 2amal 2an takuna fi makanin afdal."""" "" 

This translates to: ""Dustin """"Goldust"""" Runnels commented saying: """"Luna was eccentric like me… and perhaps more… I loved her and I will miss her… I hope she is in a better place."""""".  He is the one who *expressed* something about Luna.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Xinhua:** Xinhua is a news agency reporting on an unrelated event (plane black box).
*   **C: medyer Luna:** The text doesn't mention a ""medyer Luna"" (Luna's manager/representative).
*   **D: Tommy Dreamer:** While Tommy Dreamer *mentions* Luna, he's recounting facts about her career and a poetic description of her death – not *expressing* something *about* her personally.



"
"""men ashar ela Luna 3la anha """"gheryebh alatewar""""?""","The correct answer is **B: Dustin Runnels**.

The text states: ""Dhakara Tommy Dreamer... Tawaffat Luna fi layla bazagha feha qamaran... Ennaha emra2a qaweyya."""" 3allaqa Dustin """"Goldust"""" Runnels qa2elan :"""" Luna kanat gharibat al-atwar mithli… wa rubbama akthar… 2u7ebbuha wa sawfa 2aftaqiduha… 2amal 2an takuna fi makanin afdal.""""

This directly translates to: ""Tommy Dreamer said... Luna passed away on a night with a full moon... She was a strong woman."" Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels commented saying: ""Luna was strange and evolving like me… and perhaps more… I loved her and I will miss her… I hope she is in a better place.""

Therefore, Dustin Runnels is the one who described Luna as ""gheryebh alatewar"" (strange and evolving).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...السا2eq al-ladhi 2usiba bi juru7in 5atiratin fi ra2sihi"" (the driver who suffered severe injuries to his head).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: lem yesb ayaan men alashekhas dakhel alemnezl** (No one was injured inside the house) - The passage states no one *was punished*, not that no one was injured.
* **C: tem neqlh men mesteshefa fi Cambridge ela mesteshefa fi Great Yarmouth** (He was transferred from a hospital in Cambridge to a hospital in Great Yarmouth) - The passage says the opposite: he was transferred *to* Cambridge *from* Great Yarmouth.
* **D: sa'edet khedmat aletwar' fi ekherajh men seyareth** (The paramedics helped him out of the car) - The passage states the servants (خادمات الحواري) helped him out of the car, not the paramedics.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Wa badat janub afriqya hashatan amama shaqiqatihi al-janubiyyat illa annahu sur3ana ma 7asanat min ada2iha ma3 taqaddum al-butula.""  This translates to: ""And South Africa started hesitantly in front of its southern rivals, but it quickly improved its performance as the tournament progressed.""

This directly indicates a weak start (""ada' ra'e fi bedayh alebtewlh"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: al3mal alejma'ey alemtheyr lele'ejab (the excellent teamwork):** The text *highlights* their teamwork as a strength, not a weakness.
* **B: qedrh alet3amel ma3 alekrh (ability to deal with pressure):**  The text doesn't mention anything about pressure.
* **D: alemharat aledfa'eyh (defensive skills):** The text *praises* their strong defense.



"
"wefqaan llfqrh, meta beda ada' jenweb eferyeqya fi alethesn?","The correct answer is **A: hewaley alesa'eh 10:00 sebahaan** (around 10:00 AM).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Intalaqat al-mubarat 3inda sa3a al 10 saba7an..."" which translates to ""The match started at 10:00 AM...""  This directly answers the question of when South Africa's performance began.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: b3d teshedyed aledfa'** (after the pressure intensified) - The text doesn't mention pressure intensifying at the start.
* **C: b3d alekhesarh amam Zambia** (after losing to Zambia) - South Africa *won* against Zambia, not lost.
* **D: ma3 asetmerar alebtewlh** (with the continuation of the rain) - While rain is mentioned, it's said to have cleared up before the match, so it didn't affect the start of their performance.

Here's why:

* **The passage *primarily* focuses on the massive economic transformation China has undergone since the reforms initiated under Deng Xiaoping.** It highlights the 90-fold increase in economic size, surpassing Germany in car exports, and the potential to overtake the US in overall GDP.  This directly reflects a substantial growth of the Chinese economy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: As-sin ledyha sewq letsedyer alesyarat akebr men alewlayat alemthedh** (China has a larger market for exporting cars than the United States) - While the passage states China *exported* more cars than Germany and is a larger market for manufacturing, it doesn’t say it has a larger *export market* than the US.
* **C: yemken an yekwen lelseyn fi alenhayh natej mhely ejemaley akebr men alewlayat alemthedh** (It is possible that China will eventually have a larger total product than the United States) - This is a *potential* future outcome mentioned, but not the central point of the passage.  The passage states it *could* happen ""within a few decades,"" not that it's currently true.
* **D: lem tesder As-sin abedaan seyarat akether men alemaneya** (China has never exported more cars than Germany) - This is *false* according to the text, which states China *did* export more cars than Germany in the last year.



Therefore, **A** best encapsulates the main idea of the provided text."

The passage states: ""Yumkin 2an yakun al-natij al-ma7ali al-2ijmali lil Al-9iin akbar min Al-wilayat Al-muta7ida fi ghu'9un 3a8dayn.""  This translates to: ""China's total GDP may be larger than the United States' in *two decades*.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: b3d alemzeyd men aleselahat alaqetsadeyh (after more economic reforms):** While continued reforms are important, the passage *specifically* gives a timeframe.
* **C: 3anedma tekwen aleblad thet qeyadh jedyedh (when the country has new leadership):** Leadership changes aren't directly tied to GDP surpassing the US, according to the text.
* **D: fi ghedwen thelathh 'eqewd (in three decades):** The passage states *two* decades, not three.

The passage states: ""Wa shajja3a Hu adduwal annamiya 3ala “tajannub al-masar al-qadim lil-talwith awalan thumma al-tandhif la7iqan”.""  This translates to ""And he encouraged developing countries to 'avoid the old path of pollution first, then clean up later.'""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: theml aletzamat alety tedf' bemrhelh tenmeytha** (bear the commitments that fit their development stage) - While the passage mentions not asking them to exceed their capabilities, the *primary* suggestion is prevention, not just accepting commitments.
* **B: aletrekyez 3la alenatej alaqetsadey** (focus on economic output) - The passage mentions economic output *influencing* the reduction targets, but doesn't suggest focusing *on* it as the action.
* **C: tejawez mes'ewelyathem alhaleyh** (exceed their current responsibilities) - The passage explicitly says commitments should *not* exceed their development stage, responsibility, and capabilities.



"

The passage explicitly states: ""**Wa lam yu7addid raqman littakhfidhat qa2ilan innaha satatimu 3ala asas al-natij al-iqtisadi li99in.**""  This translates to: ""And he did not specify a number for the reductions, saying that it will depend on the economic output of 99 countries.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: asas aletkhefyedat** (basis of the reductions) - The passage *does* mention the basis – the economic output of 99 countries.
* **B: eseda' alemshewrh ela alebledan alenameyh beshan aletlewth** (guidance to developing countries regarding pollution) -  The passage mentions he encouraged developing countries to ""avoid the old path of pollution first, then clean up later.""
* **C: tareykh yamel an yetm feyh khefd aneb'eathat alekrebwen** (a date by which to reduce carbon dioxide emissions) -  The passage mentions a timeframe (by 2020 compared to 2005 levels), but doesn't state a *date* for achieving a specific reduction.

This translates to: ""And the official spokesperson for Doctors Without Borders Richard Veerman said: """"Angola is heading towards its worst outbreak ever and the situation remains bad there.""""

Veerman specifically said the situation is bad *in Angola*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: menzemh ateba' bela hedwed (Doctors Without Borders):** While Veerman *represents* Doctors Without Borders, he didn't say the situation within the organization was bad.
*   **C: Mangola:** Mangola is mentioned as a charity, but Veerman doesn't comment on its condition.
*   **D: menzemh aleshh al'ealemyh (The Global Health Organization):** This organization is mentioned in the beginning, but Veerman isn't quoted speaking *about* it.

The text states: ""Estaqala Huhne wa saya7elu ma7alahu Ed Davey..."" which translates to ""Huhne resigned and Ed Davey will take his place...""

Therefore, Ed Davey will take over Huhne's position.



"

Here's why:

The text states: ""...wa mina al-mutawaqqa3 2an yaqbala anna2eb Norman Lamb manseb wazir al-a3mal al-ladhi yatrukuhu Davey.""  This translates to ""...and it is expected that MP Norman Lamb will accept the position of Minister of Business that Davey is leaving.""

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states: ""...wa yushaji3 al-masra7 nafsahu al-jamahir 3ala al-indimam ilayhim."" which translates to ""...and the artist encourages the audience to join them.""  This directly refers to joining him *on stage* to partake in smoking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: alemsharekh fi t'eatey aleqneb** (projects in a smoky atmosphere) - While there *is* smoking, the passage focuses on the artist *encouraging the audience to participate*.
* **B: rhelh ela aleyaban** (a trip to Japan) - The story is about an artist obsessed with opium and Japan, but the question asks what he encourages the audience to do *during the opera*.
* **D: yed'ewa ma yhebwenh yhedd heyathem** (invite what destroys their lives) - While the opium use is destructive, the passage doesn't state he *invites* them to ruin their lives, just to join him in smoking.



"

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Wa natijatan li thalika, ya8umu al-fananin bi tadkhin al8inb 3ala khashabat al-masra7"" which translates to ""As a result of that, the artist smokes hashish on stage.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: alejmhewr alefrensey (The French audience):** The passage says the artist *encourages* the audience to join him, but doesn't say they themselves are smoking.
* **C: alefnanewn (The artists):** The passage refers to a single artist.
* **D: Camille Saint-Saens:** Camille Saint-Saens composed the opera, he doesn't smoke hashish *in* the opera's plot. The artist *within* the opera's story is the one smoking.

"""ma hew alasem alakher lel """"alesyer fi alefda'"""" aledy qam bh leywenwef?""","The correct answer is **B: sebaq alefda'** (the Space Race).

Here's why:

The passage states that Leonov's participation in the Apollo-Soyuz mission ""symbolized the end of the Space Race"" ( *yarmuz ila intiha2 Sibaq al-Fada2*).  The question asks for the final name of ""the walk in space"" that Leonov did, and the Apollo-Soyuz mission *ended* that era of competition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: muhimmat Apollo-Soyuz:** This is the mission itself, not the name of the walk in space.
*   **C: neshat kharej alemrekbh:** This translates to ""activity outside the spacecraft"" - it *describes* the walk in space, but isn't a name for it.
*   **D: ra2ed alfda2 reqm 11:** This translates to ""Space Pioneer No. 11"" - this is Leonov's nickname, not the name of his spacewalk.



"

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ba3da 10 sanawat, qada jizi2 min al-iti7ad al-sovyeti min muhimmat Apollo-Soyuz mma yarmuz ila intiha2 Sibaq al-Fada2.""  This translates to: ""After 10 years, he (Leonov) participated with the Soviet Union in the Apollo-Soyuz mission, which symbolized the end of the Space Race.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sebaq alefda' (Space Race):** While the Apollo-Soyuz mission *ended* the Space Race, Leonov didn't participate *in* the Space Race itself in this context – he participated in a mission that signified its end.
*   **C: ra2ed alfda2 reqm 11 (Cosmonaut No. 11):** This is his title, not a mission he participated in.
*   **D: neshat ma7wl kharej alemrekbh (EVA) (spacewalk):** He *performed* the first spacewalk, but the question asks about a mission he participated in later in his career.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lama yata3arad sa2iq al-sha7ina al-baligh min al-3omor 64 3ama, ila ay isabat athna2 al-7adith."" This translates to: ""A 64-year-old truck driver was injured during the accident.""

While Gibson *died* as a result of injuries sustained *after* the accident, the driver was the one *injured during* the accident itself. The children were frightened and ran away, and the mechanic is simply a witness.



"
mada hedth lelashekhas alemtewretyen fi alhadeth?,"The correct answer is **C: kana yesrekhan weybekyan** (they were screaming and crying).

The text states: ""Kana hunaka atfal yantadhirun 3ubur attariq wa kanu jami3an yasrukhun wa yabkun"". This directly translates to ""There were children waiting to cross the road and they were all screaming and crying.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: mat kelahema** (they both died) - The text doesn't say the children died, only that they ran away.
*   **B: aseyb ahedhema, wetwefy alakher** (one was injured, the other died) - Again, the text doesn't mention any injuries or deaths of the children.
*   **D: t'ered kelahema lesabat** (both were exposed to an injury) -  The text only describes their emotional state (screaming and crying) and action (running away), not any physical injury.

The text states: ""كان الأثر الذي بات يبحث عنه الفريق نجمان عن قوة مد بين المادة المعتمة في المجرّة والمادة المعتمة في مجرّة درب التبانة.""  This translates to: ""The effect the team was looking for was the tidal force between dark matter in the galaxy and dark matter in the Milky Way.""  

""Qowa meddyah jedreyah"" directly translates to ""radial tidal force,"" which is precisely what the text describes the team investigating.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: alemadh atabey3eyh** (المادة التابعية - subsidiary matter) - This isn't mentioned as the focus of the program's observations.
* **C: alejseymat alesgheyrh** (الجُسيمات الصغيرة - small particles) - While the text *later* mentions small particles making up dark matter halos, the initial investigation was about the *force* between dark matter, not the particles themselves.
* **D: alemadh alema3etemh** (المادة المعتمة - dark matter) -  They weren't just observing dark matter, but the *effect* (tidal force) *between* dark matter in different galaxies.



"

Here's why:

The passage states:

*  ""...Tumaris majarrat darb al-tabbana 8uwwa 3ala majrrat al-qaws al-qazama..."" (مجرة درب التبانة تمارس قوة على مجرة القوس القزح...) - ""The Milky Way exerts a force on the Rainbow Galaxy...""

(...كان الأثر الذي بات يبحث عنه الفريق نجمان عن قوة مد بين المادة المعتمدة في المجرة والمادة المعتمدة في مجرة درب التبانة) - ""...The effect the team was looking for was a tidal force between matter in the galaxy and matter in the Milky Way.""

The question asks what the scientists were observing the effect of.  The passage explicitly mentions the Rainbow Galaxy (مجرة القوس القزح) and the Milky Way (مجرة درب التبانة) as the bodies involved in the tidal force being studied.

Therefore, option D is the correct answer.



"
"bena'an 3la alfqrh, ma aledy la yenteqdh alemhafezwen?","The correct answer is **A: alenefaq 3la aleghathh** (spending on relief).

Here's why:

The passage states the argument (""i7tadam al-jadal"") arose *because of* disagreement over spending on relief and reconstruction after Katrina (""al-infaq 3ala al-i'3atha wa i3adat al-i3mar"").  The conservative argument (""9fqat bush fi Nyw Awrlyanz"") was *against* this spending.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: qelh jhewd e'eadh ale'emar** (the quality of reconstruction efforts) - While the passage mentions reconstruction, the initial disagreement was about *whether* to spend, not *how well* to spend.
* **C: men yhesl 3la 'eqewd e'eadh ale'emar** (who gets reconstruction contracts) - This is a specific critique from liberals *about* the reconstruction, not the conservative position.
* **D: alenefaq 3la e'eadh ale'emar** (spending on reconstruction) - The conservatives were against *both* relief *and* reconstruction spending, but the core of the initial disagreement as stated in the text was the relief spending.



"

This translates to: ""The liberal critics focused on denying reconstruction contracts to those connected to people in power in Washington.""

Therefore, the liberals are the ones criticizing the reconstruction efforts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: alemhafezwen alemaleywen** (the conservative millionaires): The text states they *opposed* the spending, not that they were criticizing the *way* it was being done. They had a different reason for their opposition (""فقات بوش في نيو اورليانز"" - ""Bush's fault in New Orleans"").
*   **C: Bush:** Bush is mentioned as being blamed by the millionaires, but isn't directly criticizing the reconstruction process itself.
*   **D: alemtel'ewen fi Washington** (the people in Washington): They are the target of the criticism (being favored with contracts), not the source of it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: eda'h awes' netaq men alesma'** (its brightness when falling from the sky) - The passage mentions it will *look* like a shooting star, but doesn't state it's a record for brightness.
*   **B: kewnha mer'eyh fi akebr 3dd men alemden** (being seen in the largest number of countries) - The passage specifies where it will be visible (California, Oregon, Nevada, and Utah), not the number of countries.
*   **D: alesfer alaser' men San Francisco ela Los Angeles** (the fastest travel from San Francisco to Los Angeles) - While the passage *uses* the San Francisco to Los Angeles comparison to illustrate speed, it's not the record itself; the record is the return to Earth.

3la mada asethewdet eBay,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states that eBay is working to expand its revenue streams and gain popularity in regions dominated by **Skype**, specifically mentioning China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil. This directly implies that Skype is a competitor and the area eBay is trying to penetrate.  Therefore, the question ""On what does eBay invest?"" is best answered by Skype, as it's the platform/company eBay is trying to compete with in those markets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Microsoft:** While Microsoft owns Skype, the passage focuses on *Skype* as the dominant force in those regions, not Microsoft as a whole.
*   **B: Apple:** Apple isn't mentioned as a competitor in the provided text.
*   **D: Zoom:** Zoom isn't mentioned in the provided text.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states eBay is working on expanding its revenue sources and gaining popularity in regions dominated by Skype, like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil.**  This directly translates to expanding into new regions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: t'ezeyz eyeradatha** (to increase its revenues) - While expansion *will* likely increase revenues, the passage focuses on *how* they are increasing revenue – through regional expansion.
* **C: t'ezeyz mekanetha** (to strengthen its position) -  Strengthening position is a *result* of expansion, not the primary goal mentioned.
* **D: ereda' hamely alashem** (to return the company to the top) - This is a very broad goal and isn't specifically mentioned in the passage.  The passage details a specific *strategy* to achieve growth.

This clearly indicates the negotiators were *still* attempting to deal with the prisoners *after* the fighting stopped and before the fire was set.  The other options are incorrect:

* **B: tewaqem ferq aleneqad (the rescue team intervened):** They intervened *after* the fire started.
* **C: debat alesherth (the police intervened):** The text mentions ""9uba6 mujahazun bimu3adati mukafa7ati al-sha'3ab al-fina2"" (a force equipped to counter popular resistance) - this is *not* the police, and they intervened *after* the fire.

* **A: alemfawedat alnaje7h** (successful negotiations) - The text explicitly states negotiations *failed* (""matilib al-sujana2 lam takun wadi7atan"" - the prisoners' demands were not clear).
* **C: alezmela' alesjena' alejrha** (the injury of the prisoner) - While a prisoner was injured and taken to the hospital, this initiated the unrest, it didn't *end* it.
* **D: heryeq** (fire) - The fire was a *result* of the unrest, not the cause of it ending.  The fire was *extinguished* by the rescue team.

This translates to: ""The Supreme Leader of the country - Ayatollah Ali Khamenei - has stopped relying on oil, considering it a 'trap' dating back to before the Islamic Revolution of Iran in 1979 and the state must liberate itself from it.""

Therefore, Khamenei believes Iran must liberate itself from **dependence on oil**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: OPEC:** OPEC reported on oil production capacity, not on the *effect* of sanctions.
* **C: ayh alelh 'eley khamen'ey:**  Khamenei spoke about reliance on oil revenue being a ""trap,"" but didn't *admit* the sanctions were ineffective. He called for independence *from* oil revenue.

ay men ataly leys jez'aan men 3malyh aletsewyet fi fernesa?,"The correct answer is **A: senadeyq alaqetra' aleshefafh** (making the voting booths transparent).

Here's why:

The text specifically states that since 1988, voting booths *must* be transparent (""9anadi8 al-2i8tira3 shaffafa"") so observers can verify no tampering occurs.  This means transparency is *required* as part of the voting process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: alemmethelwen aledyen yerselhem alemreshhewn** (representatives that candidates send) - The text explicitly says candidates *can* send representatives to monitor the process.
* **C: aletweqy' 3la qa'emh aletsewyet** (signing the voter list) - The text describes verifying the voter's identity and then the voter signing the list. This is a standard part of the process.
* **D: ferz memthelw alemreshheyn lelasewat** (imposing representatives of candidates for the votes) - The text describes counting the votes by volunteers *under strict supervision*. It doesn't mention candidates imposing representatives *onto* the counting process.



Therefore, the only option that isn't a part of the described French voting process is making the voting booths transparent, as it is a requirement, not something that is *not* done."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 3la qa'emh aletsewyet** (on a voting list) - The text doesn't mention voting lists.
*   **C: 3la mezrewf** (on an envelope) - The envelope *contains* the paper, but the choice is marked *on* the paper.
*   **D: 3la alh dakhel keshek** (inside a booth) - This refers to where the voting takes place, not how the choice is indicated.

* **The passage states:** ""Wa tu3tabaru Allen i7da athriya2 al-3alam wa qad istathmara al-kathir min tharwatihi fi al-istikshaf al-ba7ri..."" (Allen is considered one of the world's richest men and has invested a lot of his wealth in marine exploration...)

The question asks what Allen *did* during the 8-year search.  The passage clearly states he invested his wealth in marine exploration *as part of* his search for Musashi.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: therweth (his wealth):** While he *has* wealth, the question asks what he *did* with it during the search.
* **B: ahetmamh beqyas ala'emaq (his interest in measuring depths):**  The passage mentions mapping the seafloor, but doesn't state this was *what he did* for 8 years.  It's a *method* used in the exploration.
* **D: ahetmamh balherb (his interest in the sea):** This is too general. The passage specifies investment in *exploration*, not just a general interest.

The passage states: ""و قد استثمر Allen الكثير من ثروته في الاستكشاف البحري"" which translates to ""And Allen has invested a lot of his wealth in marine exploration.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: aset'eadh Musashi (استعداد موساشي - Preparing for Musashi):** While Allen's search is *for* Musashi, he didn't spend money *preparing* Musashi.
*   **C: bena' merkebh yetm alethekm bha 3an b'ed (بناء مركبة يتم التحكم بها عن بعد - Building a remotely controlled vessel):** Building the vessel was *part* of the marine exploration, not the overall thing he invested in.

The passage states: ""Wa taftaridu al-sulutat anna al-musta3abat kanat ta7tawi 3ala wuqud al-uranyum fi al-mawqi3 wa lati mumkin an takun tasarabat wa nfajarat.""  This translates to: ""And the authorities assume that the response contained uranium fuel at the location, which may have leaked and exploded.""

The question asks what is *likely* to lead to dangerous circumstances in the area.  Uranium fuel leaking and potentially exploding is the most dangerous element mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: alesyezyewm alemsh' (The cesium smell)** - While cesium was detected, the text doesn't explicitly state the *smell* is the dangerous part, and uranium is identified as a more significant threat.
* **C: aledkhan alabeyd (The white smoke)** - The white smoke is a *result* of the incident, not the cause of the danger.
* **D: alayewdeyn (The return)** - This isn't mentioned as a source of danger at all.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...و أن يطفئوا المكيفات و عدم الشرب من الصنبور"" which translates to ""...and to turn off the air conditioners and not drink from the tap.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: tejneb asetkhedam whedat tekyeyf alhewa'** (Avoid using air conditioning units) - While the passage *says to turn them off*, avoiding use is a slightly different nuance.  Turning off is a direct instruction.
* **B: alebqa' fi aledakhel** (Stay inside) - The passage actually warns people *against* staying in their homes (""...و حذرت السلطات المحلية السكان في محيط المصنع من البقاء في منازلهم..."" - ""...and local authorities warned residents near the factory from staying in their homes..."").
* **C: tejneb asetneshaq aledkhan alabeyd** (Avoid inhaling the white smoke) - This is a good general safety precaution with smoke, but the passage doesn't specifically *instruct* this; it only *reports* the smoke. The direct instructions are about water and AC.



Therefore, option D is the most directly stated piece of advice given to residents in the passage."

While the other options are mentioned in the text, the doctor *specifically* expresses concern primarily due to the high death rate.

*   **A:** Infection in the hospital is a *possible* source, but not his primary concern.
*   **B:** Drug resistance is a defining characteristic of XDR-TB, but not what he *highlights* as worrying in this new variant.

* **C: teqneyh test3mal radaraan aredyaan** (technology using ground radar) - The passage specifically states NextGen *replaces* the old radar-based technology.

The passage specifically states that NextGen allows air traffic controllers to ""ta7did al-ta2irat bi deqqah akbar"" (identify aircraft with greater accuracy). This directly benefits controllers by giving them a more precise understanding of where planes are.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: terq teyran aqesr (shorter flight paths):** While NextGen *results* in shorter flight paths, it doesn't directly *benefit* the controllers in that way. It's a consequence of the improved system.
*   **C: khefd aneb'eathat alekrebwen (reduced carbon emissions):** This is an *outcome* of NextGen, not a direct benefit to controllers.
*   **D: kemyh aqel men alewqewd (less fuel):** Similar to carbon emissions, this is a *result* of the system, not a direct benefit for the controllers themselves.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the FBI's previous policy focused resources on cases with a higher chance of being solved ""bi-hadaf ta3ziz mu3addal naja7 al-wikala"" – *to enhance the agency's success rate*.  This is the *reason* for the policy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: tekhesyes alemzeyd men alemwared lhalat alesyarat alemserweqh** (allocating more resources to stolen car cases) - While stolen car cases *were* a focus, this is *how* they tried to achieve the goal, not the goal itself.

This directly translates to: ""During the elections of 1976, he worked as an advisor to Carter regarding foreign policy, then worked as an advisor for national security (NSA) from 1977 until 1981.""

Therefore, Brzezinski is most famously known for working with Carter.

The text states: ""5alafan li Henry Kissinger"" which translates to ""succeeded Henry Kissinger"". This means Kissinger held the position *before* Brzezinski, and Brzezinski started in 1977. Therefore, Kissinger held the position of National Security Advisor until 1977.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Brzezinski** - The text says Brzezinski started in 1977, not *until* 1977.
*   **C: Carter** - Carter was President, not the National Security Advisor.

* **B is correct:** The passage explicitly says no one has scored more goals for Partizan than Bobek.
* **C is correct:** The passage states he was chosen as the best player in the club's history in 1995.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **C: l'eb ma3 Partizan heta 3am 1995** (He played with Partizan until 1995) - He left in 1958, not 1995.  1995 is when he was *named* the best player in Partizan's history.

* **C: lh jesm dew reysh kamel** (its body is completely covered in feathers) - The passage states it *is believed* to be fully feathered, but this isn't a distinguishing feature *from* Velociraptor, as Velociraptor is also thought to have been feathered.

This directly implies screens *were* set up *elsewhere* in Rome because the square itself couldn't accommodate everyone.  Therefore, screens were *not* installed *in* St. Peter's Square.

*   **C: في مواقع معينة في بولندا** (In specific locations in Poland) - The text says Poland had similar preparations, indicating screens *were* set up there.



"
ayen aqeymet merasem alejnazh?,"The correct answer is **C: fi sa7et alqdeys btrus** (in St. Peter's Square).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...lam yakun minal mumkin lil jami3 al-wusul ila al-janaza fi sa7at al-qiddis Butros."" (It was not possible for everyone to reach the funeral in St. Peter's Square).  This directly indicates the funeral was *held* in St. Peter's Square, even though the crowds were too large to all fit there.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: fi mewaq' mekhetlefh fi jami3 anha' rewma** (in different locations throughout Rome) - While screens *were* set up in different locations, the funeral itself wasn't held across multiple locations.
* **B: fi bewlenda** (in Poland) - Poland had *viewing* events, but the funeral wasn't *in* Poland.
* **D: awelaan fi rewma, them fi medyenh eyetaleyh akhera** (first in Rome, then in other cities) - The text doesn't suggest the funeral moved to other cities.

"b3d alanefjar, men aledy 'ewelj men esabat khetyerh?","The correct answer is **A: 3la alaqel khemsh ashekhas** (At least five people).

Here's why:

The text states: ""كان هناك خمسة أشخاص على الأقل في الأعلى في الموقع وقت الانفجار وقد عولجوا من أعراض القدم."" (There were at least five people upstairs at the site at the time of the explosion and they were treated for minor injuries.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: la ahed (no one)** - The text explicitly says five people were injured.
* **C: mes'ewel s7erkh aleghaz (the gas company official)** - The official arrived *after* the explosion and didn't suffer injuries from it.
* **D: jar (neighbor)** - While a neighbor reported the gas leak, the text doesn't say they were injured.



"
men abelgh 3an tesreb aleghaz?,"The correct answer is **A: jar fi alembena (a neighbor in the building)**.

The text states: ""Wa qad wasala mas2ul bi-sharikat a;-ghaz ila makan al-7adith ba3da **2an itasala a7ad al-jiran** bi sha2n tasarub lil ghaz.""  This translates to ""And a representative from the gas company arrived at the scene after **one of the neighbors** called about a gas leak.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: aleshekhes aledy y'eyesh fi alesheqh (the person who lives in the apartment):** The text specifically states no one was *in* the apartment at the time of the explosion.
* **C: mes'ewel fi s7erkh aleghaz (representative of the gas company):**  The representative *responded* to the call, they didn't make it.
* **D: medyer alembena (building manager):** The text doesn't mention the building manager at all.



"
"wefqaan llfqrh, kem 3dd alashekhas aledyen leqwa hetfhem fi alhejwem?","The correct answer is **A: 4**.

Here's why:

The text states the following people died:

*   Nicholas Alden (25 years old)
*   Zachary Cuddeback (21 years old)

And the following were injured:

*   Edgar Veguilla
*   Kristoffer Schneider

Therefore, a total of **4** people were affected (died or injured) in the attack."
men aledy feshel fi etelaq alenar fi weqt ma athena' alhejwem?,"The correct answer is **B: Uka**.

Here's why:

The text states ""A5faqa sila7 Uka bynama kana musawabban 3ala ra2isi rajoulen 5amsiniy."" This translates to ""Uka woke up while he was incorrectly on the head of a fifty-year-old man."" This implies Uka failed to properly deploy/launch the parachute during the jump.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **Cuddeback:** The text states he *was* the jumper, not that he failed to deploy.
*   **Schneider:** He was injured *after* the jump, requiring facial reconstruction.
*   **Alden:** The text doesn't mention any issues with his jump.



"
ay men aleryadat atalyh tem aletsewyet 3aleha letbeqa kharej alebrenamej alawelmeby?,"The correct answer is **C: alebyesbewl** (Baseball).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...وكذلك البيسبول والكريكت اللذين جرى استبعادهما خارج الألعاب الأولمبية عام 2005.""  This translates to ""...as well as baseball and cricket which were excluded from the Olympic Games in 2005.""

The question asks which sport was *voted on to remain outside* the Olympic program. Baseball is specifically mentioned as having been previously removed and is now still outside.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: alesekwash** (Squash) - The text says squash *attempted* to get in, but doesn't say it was voted on to stay out.
*   **B: alerjeby** (Riding/Equestrian) - This sport isn't mentioned in the text at all.
*   **D: alekarateyh** (Karate) - The text says karate *attempted* to get in, but doesn't say it was voted on to stay out.



"
ay men aleryadat atalyh sewtet aleljenh alawelmebyh aledwelyh letdemyenha fi alal'eab?,"The correct answer is **C: ette7ad alergheby** (the rugby union).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Wa tamma ikhtiyar arrugby wa la siyyama **itti7ad arrugby** wal golf min bayn 5 riyadat ukhra lil musharaka al-Olombiyad.""  This translates to ""Rugby was chosen, specifically the **rugby union**, and golf from among 5 other sports to participate in the Olympics.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aleryadat aledwarh** (the rotating sports) - This isn't a specific sport mentioned as being considered.
* **B: alebyesbewl** (baseball) - The text states baseball was *removed* from the Olympics in 2005.
* **D: alekrh alelyenh** (the fitness game) - This isn't a sport mentioned in the text.



"
qam Arthur Guinness fi alasel betajeyr St James’ Gate Brewery lekm sana?,"The correct answer is **A: 250**.

The text states ""Wa ba3da 250 3aman, ta7awalat Guinness ila sharika 3alamiya..."" (And after 250 years, Guinness transformed into a global company...).  The question asks how long Arthur Guinness has been leasing the brewery. The answer is 250 years after signing the 9000 year lease.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 10** - This number isn't related to the duration of the lease or the company's history mentioned.
* **C: 1759** - This is the year the lease was signed, not how long it's been in effect.
* **D: 9000** - This is the *length* of the lease, but the question asks how long ago the lease began and how long Guinness has been operating there.



"
hewaley kem melyar dewlar tedrha Guinness kel 3am?,"The correct answer is **C: 14**.

The text states Guinness generates ""akhtar min 10 milyarat yoro (ay ma yu3ad 14.7 milyar dolar amriki) kul 3am"" which translates to ""more than 10 billion euros (which is equivalent to 14.7 billion US dollars) each year"".  Therefore, approximately 14 billion US dollars.



"
kem 3dd beldan alal ette7ad al Europiy alety tem alet'eref 3la feyrews H5N1 feyha?,"The correct answer is **B: seta** (six).

Here's why:

The text states France is the seventh country in the European Union affected by the H5N1 virus, *after* listing six others:

1.  Annamsa (Namusa - likely a misspelling of **Namibia**, but irrelevant as it's not in the EU)
2.  Almanya (Germany)
3.  Slovenia
4.  Bulgharia (Bulgaria)
5.  Alyunan (Greece)
6.  Italya (Italy)

Therefore, a total of *seven* countries are mentioned as having the virus. However, the question asks how many countries *already* had it before France, which is six.

**Important Note:** The mention of Namibia is likely a transcription error. The context clearly indicates countries *within* the European Union.



"
ayen tem alet'eref 3la ahedth halh men feyrews H5N1?,"The correct answer is **A: farnsa (France)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...*tamma al-3uthur 3alayha mayyita fi mustanqa3at Lyon sharq Faransa*."" (Cases were found dead in farms in Lyon, eastern France).  This directly indicates the latest confirmed cases are in France.

While the text *mentions* Germany, Denmark, Greece, etc., it states they are *already* suffering from the virus, not that they are experiencing new developments as of this report.  It also notes that cases in Croatia and Denmark are *unconfirmed*.

meta kanet akher mewajhh lhayety ma3 alemred qebl alanetshar aledy sebbh qewat hefz aleslam?,"The correct answer is **A: aleqren aletas' 'esher (the 1800s)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lam takun tuwajih Haiti ay mashakil muta3alliqa bil marad mundhu 7iqbat al 1800, ay qabla wusul al-quwwat.""  This translates to: ""Haiti had not faced any problems related to the disease since the 1800s, that is, before the arrival of the forces.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: qebl weqt qesyer men weswel aleqwat (a short time before the forces arrived):** The text specifically says *since* the 1800s, not a short time before.
* **C: qebl weqw' alezlezal (before the earthquake):** While the earthquake is mentioned, the text clarifies the last outbreak was much earlier.
* **D: fi 3am 2009 (in 2009):** The text clearly states the last outbreak was in the 1800s.



"
sahemt alenfayat men ay mewq' fi anetshar alemred?,"The correct answer is **A: nher Artibonite**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""lam yatim ta3qim al-nufayat bi-sura sa7i7a min mukhayamat al-umam al-muta7ida mimma sababa bi dukhul al-baktirya ila rawafid nahr Artibonite...""  This translates to: ""Waste was not disinfected properly from the UN camps, which led to bacteria entering the Artibonite River...""

Therefore, the river (nahr Artibonite) is directly identified as the pathway through which the disease spread due to improper waste disposal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ma3esekr alamem alemthedh (UN camps):** While the camps *caused* the problem by not disinfecting waste, the river is where the spread *occurred*.
*   **C: mewq' zelzal 3am 2010 (2010 earthquake site):** The earthquake created a vulnerable situation, but it wasn't the direct source of the disease's spread.
*   **D: alema3ehed alhayety lel'edalh waledyemqerateyh (Haiti Institutes for Justice and Democracy):** This is an organization that *reported* on the issue, not a contributor to the spread.



"
ma aledy tekhett alhekwemh alayerlendeyh lef'elh?,"The correct answer is **B: sen qewaneyn akether seramh beshan sama7eyh alemkhedrat** (enacting more lenient laws regarding drugs).

Here's why:

* **The passage states the government is pushing for parliamentary legislation (""tashri3 barlamani"") to deal with the situation.** This indicates they want to *change* the laws.
* **The spokesperson states the need for legislation from a public health and criminal justice perspective.** This points towards a new approach, likely addressing the issues with current drug-related laws.
* **The Minister of Health expresses concern for individuals benefiting from the *temporary* legality of certain substances and pending prosecutions since the constitutional changes took effect.** This suggests the current situation is unstable and needs a permanent legal framework.  A more lenient approach seems to be hinted at by the concern for those currently in a legal grey area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: tewzey' aledanat 3la mertekbey jera'em alemkhedrat** (distributing convictions to drug criminals) - This is the opposite of what the passage suggests; it's about *applying* existing laws, not changing them.
* **C: tekhefyef aleqwaneyn alemt'eleqh besmaheyh alemkhedrat** (tightening existing laws regarding drugs) - This contradicts the overall tone of the passage, which implies a need for a new approach, potentially more lenient.
* **D: elegha' tejreym alemkhedrat** (canceling drug crimes) - This is too extreme and isn't supported by the text. The passage suggests a *change* in laws, not a complete cancellation of drug-related offenses.



"
ma aledy kan qanewneyaan ma3eqetaan fi ayerlenda?,"The correct answer is **D: alemkhedrat** (the drugs law).

Here's why:

The Arabic text discusses the urgency of enacting parliamentary legislation to *deal with the situation* (likely referring to drug use).  The speaker for the government explicitly mentions concerns about public health and criminal justice regarding this legislation. The Minister of Health expresses concern about individuals benefiting from the temporary legality of certain substances and pending convictions related to drugs that occurred *after* the unconstitutional changes came into effect.

This clearly points to the issue being about drug legalization/decriminalization and the need for a new, constitutional drug law.  ""Alemkhedrat"" (the drugs law) is the only option that directly relates to this topic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: alestew** - This doesn't fit the context of the passage.
*   **B: alahetyal** - This doesn't fit the context of the passage.
*   **C: ala'eteda'** - This doesn't fit the context of the passage.



"

The Arabic text (P) states: ""...al-jani al-dhakar al-mushtabah bihi yakhda3 lil ta7qiq bi-tuhmat **al-ta3addi 3ala mumtalakat al-ghayr** wa laysa al-takhrib.""  This translates to ""...the male suspect is being questioned on suspicion of **trespassing** and not vandalism.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: aledrer alemadey (damaging property):** The text specifically says it's *not* vandalism (takhrib).
*   **C: aletkheryeb (sabotage):**  The text doesn't mention sabotage.
*   **D: alesreqh (theft):** The text doesn't mention theft.



"
"3nd tegheyyer alelafeth, ma aledy lm yef'elh alemshetbh bh?","The correct answer is **A: gheyr ahed herwefha** (changing one of its letters).

Here's why:

The passage states the suspect *changed* the letter ""O"" to read like a small ""e."" This is the only action described that involved altering the sign itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: tezyenha b3lamh selam** (decorating it with a peace symbol) - The sign was *decorated* with the peace symbol and a heart, but this wasn't the alteration the suspect did.
* **C: elhaq derr madey bha** (causing material damage to it) - The passage specifically states ""Lam tata3arrad al-3alama madiyyan"" (The sign was not materially damaged).
* **D: asetkhedm aleqmash alemshema3 let'edeylha** (using black cloth to modify it) - The black cloth was used to *cover* the sign during the modification, not to modify it *itself*.



"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ay mema yely lm yethem bh alema3elem alenejleyzey karenw?","The correct answer is **B: mewa'edh talebh** (making appointments with students).

Here's why:

The text states: ""عالم مهارات المواعضة في الملاهي"" (3alim maharat al-muwa3ada fi al-mulaha'6at) which translates to ""skilled in the art of making appointments in cafes/entertainment places.""  This is a claim *about* Karno, not an accusation *against* him.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kherq heqweq alemlekyh** (violating intellectual property rights) - The text *does* state he was previously accused of this (""2ettuhima sabiqan bi 2entihak 7uquq al-tab3 wal nasher"")
* **C: teba'eh ale3lanat gheyr alemsemwh bha** (publishing unauthorized advertisements) - Modern Education accused him of this (""2etahamathu madrasat Modern Education bi tiba3at e3lanat kabirah 3ala al-7afilat min dun tasri7"")
* **D: asetkhedam leghh bedy'eh fi alefsel** (using vulgar language in the classroom) -  The text says he was accused of this (""wa qila innahu esta5dama al-alfadh annabiya wal badhi2a da5el al-fasel."")



Therefore, making appointments with students is the only thing mentioned in the text that isn't an accusation *against* Karno. It's a description of his behavior."
"wefqaan llfqrh, men lm yuakhed rheynh men qebl rewlanedw meynedweza?","The correct answer is **B: rejal sherth (police)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Laqad atlaqa Rolando Mendoza annar min bunduqiyatihi al-M16 3ala suyya7."" (Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 rifle at the police.)

This directly indicates that the police were targets *before* the hostages were released. The other options were released:

*   **sa'ehewn (travelers/tourists):** Some were released.
*   **atfal (children):**  Released.
*   **meswerwen (photographers):** Released.



"
"bena'an 3la alfqrh, ay alerha3an lm yetm aletaked men etelaq serahhem mebkeraan?","The correct answer is **B: kebar alesn (the elderly)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...و كذلك المسيرون الفيليبينيون. حلا المسيرون لاحقا محل سيدة مسنة، إذ كانت بحاجة لاستخدام المرحاض."" ( ""...and also the Filipino journalists. The journalists later swapped places with an elderly woman, as she needed to use the restroom."")

This indicates the elderly woman was released *later* than the journalists, meaning she wasn't among the first released hostages. The text also explicitly mentions children (al-atefal) were released early.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: alesa'ehewn (the prisoners/offenders):** This doesn't relate to the hostages.
*   **C: alemsewrewn (the journalists):**  The text says they *were* released early.
*   **D: alatefal (the children):**  The text says they *were* released early.

"wefqaan llfqrh, men aledy yejma3 aletweqy'eat led'em teqneyn zewaj alemthelyeyn fi alebrazeyl?","The correct answer is **D: Marta Suplicy**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""تمت صياغة مشروع القانون الأصلي من قبل عمدة ساو باولو السابق، مارتا سوبليسي."" (The original draft of the law was formulated by the former mayor of Sao Paulo, Marta Suplicy.)

Therefore, Marta Suplicy is the one who initially drafted the law for same-sex marriage in Brazil.



"
lemn seyqedm alemhetjewn 'ereydethem?,"The correct answer is **A: alekneysh alekat7wleykeyh alerwemaney (The Roman Catholic Church)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""wa qad 3aradhat al-kanisa al-rumaniyya al-kathulikiyya bi-stimrar idfa2 al-shar3iyya 3ala zawaj al-mithliyyin fil bilad."" (And the Roman Catholic Church has consistently opposed the legalization of same-sex marriage in the country.)

This directly indicates that the Roman Catholic Church is the entity opposing the legalization. The question asks who is opposing their wishes (presumably the wishes of those advocating for same-sex marriage legalization).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Roberto Jefferson:**  The text doesn't mention this person.
*   **C: alekwenghers alewteny lelberazeyl (The National Congress of Brazil):** The Congress *discussed* the law, but the text doesn't portray them as actively opposing anyone's wishes.
*   **D: 3amdh São Paulo (Mayor of São Paulo):** While a former mayor initiated the original draft law, the text focuses on the Church's opposition.

Here's why:

Armand Versace specifically states: ""لقد خسرتُ شقيقتي وصديقتها"" (I have lost my sister and her friend). This directly translates to losing trace of a family member (his sister).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: bedat alethelwej** (the snow started) - While there is mention of hail, the initial description focuses on *rain* being strong and dense.
* **B: kan al'ered metakheraan khems deqa'eq** (the show was five minutes late) - The text mentions the ride starting *after* five minutes of the show, not that the show itself was late.
* **C: kanet henak reyah shedyedh** (there was strong wind) - The text focuses on strong *rain* and hail, not wind.



"
"wefqaan le Versace, meta bedat aqewa aleryah?","The correct answer is **A: b3d deqa'eq qelyelh men bed' al'ered** (a few minutes after the show began).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ba3d khamsi daqa2iq min al-3ard, tabda2 al-riya7 fi al-dawaran..."" (Five minutes after the show, the wind begins to swirl...).  Armand Versace's statement doesn't mention *when* the wind started, only what happened *during* the wind and storm. He's describing events *within* the storm, not its beginning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: b3d alametar:** The rain came *after* the wind started, not the other way around.
* **C: b3d an feqd akheth:** Versace losing his sister happened *during* the storm, not when it began.
* **D: qebl alethelwej:**  ""qebl alethelwej"" implies before the storm, but the text clearly states the wind started *after* the show began.

"qebl feryed, kem 3dd al'ewasef alekbera alety sujelt sherq 35 derjh gherbaan?","The correct answer is **C: athenan (two)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...wa thalith i3sar kabir faqat tama tasjiluh sharqan bi zawiyat 35 daraja gharban.""  This translates to ""...and only the third major hurricane to be recorded east of 35 degrees west.""

If Fred is the *third* major hurricane recorded east of 35 degrees west, that means *two* were recorded before him. 

Therefore, the answer is two."
"3anedma kan feryed mewjewdaan baleqreb men jezr aleras alakhedr, fi ay atejah kan yetjh?","The correct answer is **D: shemal gherbey** (northwest).

The text states: ""yatajih na7wa al-shamal al-gharbi"" which translates to ""it is heading towards the northwest.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: gherbaan** (west) - While the storm *started* west of Cape Verde, it was heading *northwest* at the time mentioned in the text.
*   **B: jenwebaan** (south) - The storm is moving *away* from the south.
*   **C: sherqaan** (east) - The storm is moving *away* from the east.

The passage explicitly states: ""Tu3atabru sur3at 802.11n asra3 bikathir min sabiqatiha..."" which translates to ""The speed of 802.11n is considered much faster than its predecessors...""

Therefore, 802.11n is the fastest among the options listed."
ma hew derwery leky yekwen 802.11n metwafeqaan ma3 802.11b?,"The correct answer is **D: ajhezh radeyw mezdewjh** (dual radio devices).

Here's why:

The passage states that 802.11n can be compatible with 802.11a/b/g *if* the access point has dual radio devices. This is the condition needed for backward compatibility.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ser'eat aser' bektheyr** (faster speed) - While 802.11n *is* faster, speed isn't the *requirement* for compatibility with 802.11b.
* **B: aleqderh 3la teshegheyl 802.11b 3la 5.0 jeyghahertez** (ability to operate 802.11b on 5.0 GHz) - 802.11b operates on 2.4 GHz, not 5.0 GHz.
* **C: natej 600 meyghabeyt fi alethaneyh** (result of 600 megabits per second) - This is the maximum *speed* of 802.11n, not the condition for compatibility with 802.11b.

Here's why:

The text states the swimmer was aiming for the gold medal in **two** events (100m and 200m freestyle) *across three rounds* of the Commonwealth Games. Therefore, he was competing in events over three rounds.

Let's break it down:

* **100 meter siba7a 7orra:** One event
* **200 meter siba7a 7orra:** One event
* **thalath jawlat:** Three rounds (referring to stages of competition within those events, like heats, semi-finals, and finals).

While he aimed for two *types* of medals, the question asks about the *number of events/rounds* he was competing in for the possibility of winning a gold medal.  The ""three rounds"" detail is key.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**tamma man3 estekhdamiha athna2 al-musharaka fi al-al3ab.**"" (their use was prohibited during participation in the Games). This directly answers the question of why the athlete couldn't take the medication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: lem yekn ledyh ay alem** (He didn't have any pain) - The passage says he *had* pain (""alamihi"").
* **B: j'eleth yesh'er balemred** (He felt uncomfortable) - While discomfort might be a consequence of his condition, it's not the reason he couldn't take medication.
* **C: kan qelqaan men an y'ether delk selbaan 3la leyaqeth** (He was worried it would negatively affect his fitness) - The passage doesn't mention any concerns about side effects, only the prohibition of use.

(News came from the Icelandic Meteorological Office indicating the absence of seismic activity in the Hekla region during the past 48 hours.)  This report directly addresses and potentially clarifies confusion about seismic activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: wejwed alesheb aledakenh** (the presence of dark clouds) - The passage states the clouds were *unrelated* to volcanic activity and *caused* confusion, they didn't help clarify it.
* **C: kheryeth alezlezal aledwelyh** (international earthquake maps) - These maps showed no earthquake, but the passage focuses on the *local* Icelandic reports to address the confusion.
* **D: alenshat alembelgh 3anh fi menateq akhera men ayeslenda** (activity reported in other regions of Iceland) - The passage focuses on the Hekla region and doesn't mention activity elsewhere influencing the confusion.

The text states: ""حدثت نشاط الزلزال الضخم الذي أدى إلى تغيير المرحلة بتاريخ 10 مارس/آذار"" which translates to ""The large earthquake activity that led to a change in phase occurred on March 10th.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: fi al 48 sa'eh alemadeyh** (in the last 48 hours) - This refers to a lack of seismic activity *after* the change, not when the change itself happened.
*   **D: fi alasebw' alesabeq** (in the previous week) - The text doesn't mention the change happening in the previous week.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""wanaja7 fy al-hubu6 bil8urb min al-8u6b al-Janwbiy lil8amar."" which translates to ""and succeeded in landing gently from the southern pole of the moon."" This directly indicates a successful launch and landing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kan lelmerkebh alemdareyh alety atelqet alemsebar taqem** (The orbital vehicle that launched the probe had a structure) - The passage doesn't focus on the structure of the launch vehicle.
* **B: ahetwa alemsebar 3la adewat heyweyh** (The probe contained living tools) - The passage mentions ""thalath adawat 3ilmiya muhimma"" (three important scientific instruments), not living tools.
* **D: kanet jewaneb alemsebar theml reswemaan** (The sides of the probe contained drawings) - While the passage mentions the probe carried the Indian national flag, it doesn't say the *sides* contained drawings. It says the flag was depicted from all directions.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""wanaja7 fy al-hubu6 bil8urb min al-8u6b al-Janwbiy lil8amar"" which translates to ""and succeeded in landing softly on the south pole of the moon."" This directly indicates a successful landing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: hebt baleqreb men aleqteb aleshemaley lelqemr** (it landed near the north pole of the moon) - The passage specifically states it landed on the *south* pole.
* **C: tem etelaqh men merkebh medareyh ma7wlh** (it was launched from its orbital vehicle) - While true, this describes the *process* of getting there, not a defining characteristic of the lander itself.
* **D: kan yheml adateyn hametyen** (it carried two scientific instruments) - The passage states it carried *three* scientific instruments (""7amlih li thalath adawat 3ilmiya muhimma"").

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kama wa3adat al-7ukumat bi3idati malayin min amubulat lu8a7 altihab addima'3, mima sayusa3id fi e3dad al-wakalat a9i7iyti lil3am al-mu8bil.""  This translates to: ""The government also promised several million doses of hemorrhagic fever vaccines, which will help prepare health agencies for the coming year.""

The question asks what the government is planning to implement to counter the disease. Vaccines are the direct response mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: alembeydat alhesheryh** (insecticides) - While mentioned (rash al-mubidat - spraying pesticides), it's a measure to control the *source* of the disease (pigs) not directly treating the disease in humans.
*   **B: sa'edew alekhenazeyr** (pig culling) -  Also mentioned (nahsir sa2idi al-khanazir - culling pigs), but again, this is a preventative measure, not a direct treatment.
*   **D: seta'er aleb'ewed** (isolation barriers) - Mentioned (tawzi3 alaf min sata2er al-ba3ud - distributing thousands of barriers), these are for *prevention* of spread, not treatment.



"

The text states: ""Yanta8il al-mar'9 3an 6ari8 al-khanazir wallaty tanta8il ba3d thalik ela al-ensan 3an 6ari8 al-ba3u'9.""  This translates to: ""The disease spreads from pig saliva, which then spreads to humans from mosquito saliva.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: aleb'ewed (the mosquitoes):** While mosquitoes *transmit* the disease, they aren't the *source* of the initial spread from animals.
*   **B: alembeydat alhesheryh (insect bites):** Too general. The text specifically mentions mosquito saliva.
*   **C: alekhenazeyr (the pigs):** Pigs are the *source* of the virus, but the transmission to humans happens via mosquito saliva.



"
yemken an y'edey feshel alejmelh alethaneyh ela ay netyejh?,"The correct answer is **A: fhes fewrey l HJR-3** (failure to ratify HJR-3).

Here's why:

The text states that removing the second clause (""إسقاط القرار الثاني، الذي يقترح حظر زواج المدنية من أصحاب الجنس نفسه"") opens the door for civil unions in the future.  However, it *also* states that HJR-3 will be reviewed again in 2015 or 2016 to remain in effect.  **If the second clause is removed, and HJR-3 then *fails* to be ratified in the next legislative session, that's the direct consequence – HJR-3 would be defeated.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: alheq alemsetqebley fi alal ette7adat alemdenyh alemthelyh** (the right to future civil unions similar to those in other states): While the removal of the clause *allows* for this, the text doesn't say it *guarantees* it.  It depends on the future ratification of HJR-3.
* **C: jelsh teshery'eyh tar'eh** (a legislative session rejects it): This is too vague. The text is specifically about the fate of HJR-3.
* **D: men' alal ette7adat alemdenyh alemthelyh** (a ban on civil unions similar to those in other states): The removal of the clause is *against* a ban, not for it.



"

The text states: ""Tamma ijra2 taghyir fi hathihi al-dawra al-tashri3ia 3indama tamma hathf al-jumla al-thania...fi 3am 2011."" (A change was made in this legislative session when the second clause was removed... in 2011.)

This directly indicates that the removal of the second clause happened in 2011.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: khelal alejlesh aletshery'eyh** (during the legislative session) - While it happened *during* a legislative session, the question asks *when* it was removed, and the text specifies the year.
*   **C: yewm alethenyen** (on Monday) - Monday is when the upper council (majlis al-shuyukh) approved the removal, but not when the process *started* or when the clause was originally removed.
*   **D: fi 2015** (in 2015) - 2015 is when further review (muraja3at) of HJR-3 will occur, not when the clause was removed.

The passage states: ""Yuqsadu bi-“watha2iq Panama” 3ashru malayin wathiqa min asharika al-panamiya al-qanuniyya **Mossack Fonseca** al-lati tasarabt lil sa7afa...""  (The ""Panama Papers"" refer to ten million documents from the Panamanian legal firm **Mossack Fonseca** that were leaked to the press...).

The question asks *from whom* the ""Panama Papers"" were leaked. The text directly identifies Mossack Fonseca as the source.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: aleshafh** (the press) - The press *received* the leak, they didn't *cause* it.
*   **C: Deutsche Bank** - Deutsche Bank was implicated *in* the papers (helping clients hide money), but didn't leak them.
*   **D: qadh hekwemh ayeslenda** (the government of Iceland) - The government of Iceland was affected *by* the papers (leading to a resignation), but didn't leak them.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Za3amat jaridat The Guardian al-britaniyya anna bank Deutsche yusayter 3ala thuluth min 1200 sharikat wahmiyya li ta7qiq dhalik.""  This translates to: ""The British newspaper The Guardian claimed that Deutsche Bank controlled a third of 1200 shell companies to achieve that (hiding wealth).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 3mala' meysewrewn men mekhetlef alebnewk (Facilitators from different banks):** The passage specifically names *Deutsche Bank*, not a general group of facilitators.
*   **B: mekteb alemhamah alebnemyh (The British legal office):** The passage doesn't mention a British legal office.
*   **D: alhekwemh alebakestaneyh (The Pakistani government):** The passage mentions the resignation of the Pakistani Prime Minister *due to* the scandal, but doesn't say the government was involved in controlling shell companies.

Here's why:

The text states: ""la8ad shahidat Eyran al-shahr al-ma'9y aswa2 karitha jawiya laha munth sanawat 3indma ta7a6amat 6a2iratu rukkab kanat mutawajjiha ela Armynya mima asfar 3an ma8tal 168 kanu 3ala matniha.""  This translates to: ""Iran witnessed the worst air disaster in years this month when a passenger plane heading to Armenia crashed, resulting in the death of 168 people on board.""

This incident resulted in 168 deaths, which is significantly higher than the 17 deaths in the Mashhad incident or the 3 deaths from the police report. Therefore, the Armenia-bound plane crash had the largest number of fatalities.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Wa ta3ni al-3uqubat al-dawliyya al-jadid annahu la yumkinu shira2 tayyarat."" (And the new international sanctions mean that it is not possible to buy planes.)  This directly links the sanctions to the inability to acquire new aircraft, contributing to the problem of frequent air accidents due to an aging fleet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: asetwel qedyem men aleta'erat alemdenyh wal'esekreyh** (An old fleet of civilian and military planes) - This *describes* a problem, but isn't the *cause* of the increased incidents.
* **B: neqs fi alemyezaneyh alety tesmh beshera' ta'erat jedyedh** (A lack in budgets that allows buying new planes) - The passage doesn't mention budget issues, it specifically focuses on sanctions.
* **D: asetwel men aleta'erat sey' alesyanh** (An old fleet of civilian planes) - Similar to A, this is a description of the situation, not the reason *why* the situation exists and worsens.

Therefore, criticism of the current policy *is* included in the report.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: e3lan anh ma3 b3d aletgheyyerat, yemken tejneb al3anef alemtezayed fi al'eraq** (a declaration that with changes, violence can be avoided in Iraq) - The passage states the report warns of escalating violence if action isn't taken, it doesn't *declare* violence can be avoided with changes, but rather warns about it *without* changes.
* **C: tewseyat letameyn hedwed al'eraq** (recommendations to secure Iraq's stability) - The passage explicitly mentions a recommendation to secure Iraq's borders and re-establish diplomatic relations, contributing to stability.
* **D: neda' men ajel ejema' ameryeky** (a call for American consensus) - The passage states ""Yabda2 al-taqrir bi-da3wa li ijra2 niqash maftou7 wa tashkil mawqif jama3i fi al-wilayat al-muta7ida 7awla assiyasa tijaha al-sharq al-awsat"" (The report begins with a call for an open discussion and forming a collective stance in the United States regarding policy towards the Middle East).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: e3lan deman lewqef al3anef alemtezayed (a demand for a ceasefire)** - The text doesn't mention a ceasefire.
*   **C: asetkhedam alemnaqeshh alemfetwhh (using an open discussion)** - While the report *calls for* an open discussion, it doesn't say they investigated that *as a topic*.
*   **D: enesha' mebaderh deblewmaseyh jedyedh (launching a new diplomatic initiative)** - The report *recommends* a new diplomatic initiative, but doesn't say they investigated this *as a topic* within the report itself.

Therefore, Lo Piccolo was considered Provenzano's right hand.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...wa qad awdat bi-7ayat rajulay al-mafya al-salibiyya Giovanni Falcone wa Paola Borsellino fi 3am 1992."" (…and that brought the lives of the two mafia men Giovanni Falcone and Paola Borsellino in 1992).  It then links this to a war started by Riina: ""Wa qad kaba7a Provenzano jima7 ha2ula2 arru2asa2 bi-wad3i 7addan lil 7arb al-lati qadatha Riina..."" (And Provenzano kept these bosses in a state of limited war that Riina started...).

Therefore, Falcone's death was a result of the war initiated by Riina.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: qetleth alesherth** (killed by the police) - The text doesn't mention the police being involved in his death.
*   **C: aumer Lo Piccolo beqtelh** (Lo Piccolo ordered his killing) - While Lo Piccolo was a powerful figure, the text links the death to Riina's war, not a direct order from Lo Piccolo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: betl al'ealem merteyn** (He was a world champion twice) - The passage doesn't mention him being a world champion. It only states he was a former Olympic and world champion.
* **B: r'eyes lejnh al ette7ad alejwedw b'emewm aleyaban** (President of the Japanese Judo Federation's training committee) - While the passage states he *was* the head of the training committee, this isn't his most significant achievement. Winning two Olympic gold medals is more defining.
* **D: khebyer jewdew** (Judo expert) - This is a general description, but doesn't highlight his major accomplishment.

Here's why:

The passage states ""wa haraba min alzawaj fi Nepal"" which translates to ""and he escaped from marriage in Nepal.""  This means Iwasaki avoided a wedding *in Nepal*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: aleyaban (Lebanon):** The passage doesn't mention Lebanon.
*   **C: alhend (India):** He was *arrested* in India, not avoiding a wedding.
*   **D: aletbet (Tibet):** He was bitten by a rabid dog in Tibet, not avoiding a wedding.



"

The text states: ""wa hajamahu kalb mas3ur fi al Tibet"" which translates to ""and a rabid dog bit him in Tibet"". 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: zewjeth alemhetmelh** (his possible wife) - The text mentions he escaped from a marriage, but doesn't say his wife bit him.
*   **B: qerasana** (thieves) - The text says thieves *robbed* him, not bit him.

This translates to: ""His teammate Fernando Alonso was in the lead for most of the race...but he lost the lead immediately after his unexpected stop...Michael Schumacher overtook him a short time after Alonso.""

Therefore, Alonso lost the lead *after* Schumacher passed him.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: b3d an atelf Schumacher 'ejelth alamameyh** (after Schumacher lost his front tire) - The text doesn't say Alonso lost the lead *because* Schumacher had a tire issue. It says Schumacher overtook *after* Alonso lost the lead.
*   **B: feqd Fisichella alesyetrh 3la seyareth** (Fisichella lost control of his car) - This is about Fisichella, not Alonso.
*   **D: qebl akhed alesdarh** (before taking the lead) - The text states Alonso *had* the lead for most of the race, he didn't lose it before taking it.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...bi-sababi darar atta3liq fi al-ma3arik al-3adida khilal al-sibaq"" which translates to ""...because of suspension damage in the numerous battles during the race.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: leqd feqd alesyetrh 3la seyareth** (He lost control of his car) - The text doesn't mention loss of control, but specifically damage to the suspension.
*   **B: tesadem ma3 Alonso** (He collided with Alonso) -  The text says Alonso finished *before* Schumacher, not that they collided.
*   **C: telf al'ejelh aledy sebbh Fisichella** (He lost the reason that caused Fisichella to finish) - This doesn't make sense in the context.  Fisichella's issue was separate, and Schumacher's issue was his own suspension damage.

This translates to: ""The bail commissioner is determined, if denied, and the official cost is paid on the charges faced by **the officer who made the arrest**."" 

This means the officer is responsible for covering the costs if bail is denied. Therefore, they are the ones who benefit from being released on bail (or responsible if not).

*   **C: menshah senteral bewkenj (Central Booking facility):** This is a location, not a person responsible for the bail.

Here's why:

The text states that Judge Glynn issued an order requiring the release of detainees held for more than 24 hours *without a hearing before a magistrate*. This means a hearing is the key requirement that must be met to justify detention beyond 24 hours.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: alekfalh (bail)** - While bail is *related* to release, the text doesn't say bail is *required* for detention under 24 hours. It's what happens *after* the hearing.
* **B: leqa' ma3 aledabet aledy ajera ala'eteqal (meeting with the officer who made the arrest)** - The text mentions the officer has to fill out paperwork, but a meeting isn't the requirement for continued detention.
* **C: them resmeyh saderh 3an aleqadey ghelyen (a formal charge issued by Judge Glynn)** - The text specifies detainees are being held *without* formal charges.  Judge Glynn's order is *about* getting a hearing *before* charges are filed (if at all).

(Diplomats found enough ambiguity in the Afghan constitution to justify that a re-run was unnecessary.) and ""Yatana8'9 hatha ma3 al-ta8arir al-sabi8a allati afadat bi anna el'3a2 jawlat al-e3ada 8ad yat3ar'9 ma3 al-dustur."" (This aligns with previous reports stating the second round might conflict with the constitution.)

While security risks (almakha6ir al-amniya) are *mentioned* as a reason officials considered *not* holding the second round, the *reason* it wasn't used to justify cancelling it was the constitutional ambiguity.  The passage explicitly states the ambiguity was found sufficient to declare it unnecessary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: almakha6ir al-amniya (security risks):** This was a consideration, but not the *reason* given for not using the second round.
* **C: alnfqat almrtf3eh (high costs):** Costs aren't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: alaltbas aldustury (constitutional confusion):**  While related to the ambiguity, ""atana8'9 ma3 al-dustur"" (conflicts with the constitution) is the more precise and direct answer based on the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kant mkhalfh lldustur** (It violated the constitution) - The passage says ambiguity was *found*, not a direct violation.
* **B: kant hnak makha6ir amniya** (There were security risks) - While security risks are mentioned as a consideration for officials, it's not the reason diplomats deemed the rerun unnecessary.
* **D: kant alantkhabat muklfah jedan** (The elections were very expensive) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.

The passage explicitly states that ""wukala2 siyasiyyin"" (political agents) are responsible for providing governmental and judicial services in the FATA regions, as per Article 247 of the Pakistani constitution. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: al7ukuma al-Bakistani (The Pakistani government):** While ultimately responsible, the passage states the *agents* are the ones *providing* the services.
* **C: arra2is al-Bakistani (Pakistani presidents):**  Presidents don't directly provide services.
* **D: al7ukuma al-Britania (The British government):** Pakistan gained independence from British rule, so the British government is no longer involved.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: hm y8dmwn al-khadamat al-qada2iyya** (They provide judicial services) - The passage says they are *responsible* for providing governmental and judicial services, but doesn't state they *perform* them directly. It implies they oversee it.
* **B: tm akhtyarhm mn qbl arra2is al-Bakistani** (They are chosen by the Pakistani presidents) - The passage states the Pakistani presidents *designated* them, not necessarily *chose* them in a selection process.
* **C: hm mltzmwn baldutur al-Bakistani** (They are committed to the Pakistani constitution) - While they operate *by* Article 247 of the constitution, the passage doesn't say they are fully committed to or abide by the *entire* constitution. They operate within a specific framework.

ay mma yly bqy 8yd altshghyl b3d alzlzal?,"The correct answer is **D: m76at ta8a fi Niigata** (the power station in Niigata).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dhakarat idha3at NHK al-yabaniyya anna ma7atat Kashiwazaki Kariwa lil taqa al-nawawiyya fi mu7afadhat Niigata kanat ta3mal bi-shaklin tabi3iy.""  This translates to: ""Japanese NHK radio reported that the Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata Prefecture was operating normally.""

This means the power station in Niigata *remained operational* after the earthquake.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: jmy3 almfa3lat fi ma7atat Shika fi Hokuriku** (all reactors at the Shika station in Hokuriku) - The text says these were *shut down* (""tamma ighlaq"").
*   **B: alma6ar fi Ishikawa** (the damage in Ishikawa) - The text says the damage is still being assessed (""wala yazal mu'3la8an""), not that it's still functioning.
*   **C: jmy3 khdmat alskk alhdydyh** (all railway services) - The text says some railway services were disrupted (""ta'9ararat ba3'9 a6uru8 watawa8afat khidmatu assikak al-7adydiya"").

This translates to: ""Some damages and interruptions of railway services were reported in affected areas, and the Noto Airport in Ishikawa Prefecture remains closed.""  It specifically mentions damage to *homes* (""ba3'9 a6uru8"") alongside railway service disruptions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: mufa3alayn fi ma7atat Shika (two reactors at the Shika station):** The text says these were *shut down* as a precaution, not damaged *by* the earthquake.
*   **C: b3d altro8 (some trains):** While railway services were disrupted, the text speaks of *damage* to homes.
*   **D: ma6ar Noto (Noto Airport):** The airport is *closed* but the text doesn't say it was *damaged* by the earthquake.

Here's why:

* **The document states:** The document discusses disagreements based on the *borders* before the 1967 war (""khilaf al-7udwdy allathy tastakhdimuhu Falas6yn 2istinadan ela 7udwd ma 8abl 7arb 1967""). It *uses* the 1967 borders as a reference point, but doesn't explain *why* the war happened.
* **The document mentions:**
    * **A: mst8bal al-Qudus** (the future of Jerusalem) - explicitly stated.
    * **C: alwjwd al3askry fi al-wady** (the military presence in the valley) - detailed with a 10-year Israeli presence and a 5-year Palestinian acceptance.
    * **D: alniza3 3la al7dwd** (the dispute over borders) - the entire document is *about* a disagreement over borders.

Therefore, the cause of the 1967 war is the only topic from the choices *not* addressed in the document.



"
ay mma yly lys mn m6aleb Falas6yn?,"The correct answer is **B: alwjwd al3eskry almostmr fi wady al-Ardayn** (the continued military presence in Wadi al-Ardayn).

Here's why:

The passage states that Israel demands a *continued* military presence in the Wadi al-Ardayn for ten years, while Palestinians are willing to accept this presence for only *five* years. This difference in acceptance of a military presence is a key point of contention for the Palestinians.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: hdwd mbnyh 3la zrwf ma 8bl al7rb** (borders based on circumstances before the war) - While the passage mentions borders before the 1967 war, it doesn't state this is a Palestinian demand. It describes it as the basis for the conflict.
*   **C: alajwbh almt3el8a bmost8bl al-Qudus** (answers regarding the future of Jerusalem) - The passage mentions Jerusalem is a topic of discussion, but doesn't state a specific Palestinian position *demanded* in the negotiations.
*   **D: wjwd 3askry lmdh 5ms snwat fi wady al-Ardayn** (military presence for five years in Wadi al-Ardayn) - This is what Palestinians *agree* to, not what they demand.



"

Here's why:

The text states: ""wa darasa fi jami3at New York wa fi kuliyyat al-7uquq fi jami3at Harvard"" which translates to ""and studied at New York University and at Harvard Law School."" Both of these universities are located in the United States.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: al-Sin** (China) - While the text mentions a desire to strengthen relations with China, it doesn't say Ma studied there.
*   **C: Australia** - The text doesn't mention Australia at all.
*   **D: Hong Kong** - The text states Ma is *from* Hong Kong (""Wulida Ma fi Hong Kong""), but not that he studied there.



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, f2n munasrh ay dawlh sa3edt fi fwz Ma fi alantkhabat?","The correct answer is **D: al-Sin (China)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Ma won ""bi-suhulatin 3ala minasatin tad3u ila tawtid al-3alaqat ma3a Sin al-qarriya"" which translates to ""easily on a basis calling for strengthening relations with mainland China.""  This directly indicates that a desire for better relations with China aided Ma's victory.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: alwlayat almthdh alamrykyh (The United States):** While Ma studied in the US and has a US green card, the passage doesn't say the US helped him win.
*   **B: Hong Kong:** The passage mentions Ma is *from* Hong Kong, but not that Hong Kong helped him win.
*   **C: almmlkh almutahedh (The United Kingdom):**  There's no mention of the UK in the passage.

The text states: ""اكتشفت اغلب العائلات المعنية أن Crolyn Wilson من هيئة الإسكان في أوكلاند (OHA) قد سرقت ودائع التأمين الخاصة بهم و هرابت من المدينة."" (Most of the affected families discovered that Carolyn Wilson from the Oakland Housing Authority (OHA) had stolen their insurance deposits and fled the city.)

Therefore, Carolyn Wilson worked at the **hay2at al-eskan fi Oakland (OHA)** before leaving the city.



"
"m3 b8a2 arb3 sba8at fi almaosem, mn fi almarkz alrabe3 fi al-butula?","The correct answer is **A: Hamlin**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Fil markaz al-thalith, yatakhallaf Hamlin bi 20 noqta, lakinahu yataqadam bi 5 niqat 3an Bowyer."" This translates to: ""In third place, Hamlin is 20 points behind, but ahead of Bowyer by 5 points.""

Therefore, Hamlin is in third place."
"b3d alsba8 almazkur fi alfa8arh, km 3dd aln8a6 alty ymtlkha Kahne fi btwlh al-butula?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The text states: ""Ya7talu Kahne wa Truex al-markaz al-khamis wal sadids 3ala attawali bi-rasid 2220 wa 2207 noqta.""  This translates to: ""Kahne and Truex occupy the fifth and sixth positions respectively with scores of 2220 and 2207 points.""

Therefore, Kahne has 2220 points."
"wf8aan llfa8arh, km mrha shhd alnas tsa8t alnyazk alty thbt lahqaan anha mn asl mrykhy?","The correct answer is **B: 5ms mrat** ( خمس مرات).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Wa hadhihi hiya al-marra al-khamisa tarikhiyyan al-lati yara annasu fiha suqut madda marikhiyya ila arad.""  This translates to: ""And this is the fifth time historically that people have witnessed the fall of Martian material to Earth.""

Therefore, people have witnessed the fall of Martian meteorites **five times**.  ""5ms mrat"" is the Arabic for ""five times"".

"kma zkr fi alfa8arh, ma alshyh 7wl alskhwr alty wujd anha mrykhyh alasl?","The correct answer is **C: 8ymtha akbr mn 8ymh alzahab b7awaly 11000 dolar** (Their value is greater than the price of gold by around 11000 dollars).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Wa tuba3 al-7ijara annadira bi 11 alf dolar wusulan ila 22500 alf dolar bil unsa al-wa7ida, ay aghla min si3ir adhahab bi 10 ad3af."" This translates to ""And the rare stones are sold for 11 thousand dollars reaching up to 22,500 thousand dollars per ounce, meaning they are 10 times more expensive than the price of gold.""  While the passage doesn't give the *exact* difference in dollars, it clearly states they are significantly more valuable than gold.  Option C is the closest and most accurate representation of this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 3uthr 3lyhm jmy3eaan 5lal tasa8ut annayzak fi Yulyu** (They were all affected by the meteorite fall in July) - The passage only says 15 rocks were *attributed* to the July fall, not that all were affected.
* **B: hnak 24000 mnhm** (There are 24000 of them) - The passage states there are 24,000 *meteorites* found on Earth, not specifically Martian rocks.
* **D: hnak 34 mnhm** (There are 34 of them) -  The passage states 34 Martian meteorites have been found *in total*, not relating to a specific event.



"
mta t8a3Ad Schumacher?,"The correct answer is **C: b3d an 7l m7l Felipe Massa** (after Felipe Massa's accident).

Here's why:

The text states that Schumacher was planned to replace Massa *after* Massa's serious head injury in the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.  The passage directly links Schumacher's return to Massa's accident and subsequent absence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: b3d 7adeth Felipe Massa** (after Felipe Massa's accident) - While true, it's not the *planned* return. The passage states it was a *decision* to have Schumacher replace him.
* **B: b3ed fwzh alsabe3 al-butula** (after winning the seventh championship) - Schumacher retired *after* winning his 7th championship in 2006, not as a result of it.
* **D: fi nihayh mawsem 2009** (at the end of the 2009 season) -  The passage says he will miss the *rest* of the 2009 season, implying Schumacher will take over *before* the season ends.



"
mta a6eyb Massa?,"The correct answer is **A: 5lal khilal sibaq al-ja2izah al-kubra** (During the Grand Prix race).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Yu3ani al-braziliy min isaba khatira fil ra2es ba3da **istidam khilal sibaq ja2izat al-Majar al-kubra** 3am 2009.""  This directly translates to ""The Brazilian suffers from a serious head injury after an accident **during the Hungarian Grand Prix race** in 2009.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: b3d alfwz bbutulat Formula 1** (After winning the Formula 1 championship) - The injury wasn't related to a championship win.
* **C: 8bl t8a3ed Schumacher** (Before Schumacher retired) - While Schumacher's retirement is mentioned, it's not related to Massa's injury.
* **D: 8bl mawsem 2009** (Before the 2009 season) - The injury *happened* during the 2009 season.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Suyanafis 3adad mustakhdimi Yahahoo wa Microsoft mujtami3in 3adad mustakhdimi AOL.""  This directly translates to ""The number of Yahoo and Microsoft users combined equals the number of AOL users.""

Therefore, option C accurately reflects the information presented in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: mn almrj7 an yzdad 3dd mst5dmy AOL** (It is likely that the number of AOL users will increase): The passage doesn't suggest an *increase* in users, just equality with the combined totals of Yahoo and Microsoft.
*   **B: stkwn AOL alshrkh alwhydh alty twrt swq alrsa2el alfwryh** (AOL will be the only company to dominate the instant messaging market): The passage indicates competition from Yahoo and Microsoft, not domination by AOL.
*   **D: ln ytm ast5dam AOL b3d alan fi alwlayat almthdh** (AOL will no longer be used in the United States): The passage doesn’t indicate AOL will stop being used, it only addresses the user base numbers.



"
ay mma yly 8d yntahy b3d altrtyb aljdyd?,"The correct answer is **D: shrakhet Yahoo wa Microsoft (Yahoo and Microsoft partnerships)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Suyanafis 3adad mustakhdimi Yahahoo wa Microsoft mujtami3in 3adad mustakhdimi AOL."" (The number of Yahoo and Microsoft users combined exceeds the number of AOL users.)
* **The context:** AOL was dominant, but losing ground. This suggests that Yahoo and Microsoft *benefited* from AOL's decline by gaining users. A partnership between them makes logical sense in this new landscape.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: t6wer alentrnet 3la nta8 wase3 fi alwlayat almthdh (Development of the internet on a large scale in the United States):**  While the internet *did* develop, the passage doesn't directly link that to the AOL situation. It's a general trend.
* **B: ast5dam sw8 alrsa2el alfwryh (Use of instant messaging software):**  Instant messaging was already widespread; the passage discusses a *shift* in dominance, not the introduction of the technology.
* **C: huryh AOL fi t6wer alsw8 bwtyrteha al5ash (AOL's freedom in developing the software in its own way):** The passage implies a *loss* of AOL's freedom/dominance, not continued freedom.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Wa qala maktab al-mu7afiz inna **19 min afrad ashurta kanu min bayn al-musabin**.""  This translates to ""And the governor's office said that **19 members of the police were among the injured**.""

The question asks for the number of people injured who *were not* police officers. The text directly states 19 police officers were injured, implying those are the injured individuals mentioned in the passage.  Since the question asks for non-police, and the text doesn't mention any other injured people, the answer is 19 (as they are the injured people).
"

Here's why:

The text states: ""Wa qalat ashurta innaha tashtabih bi-dulu3 tanzim al-dawla Da3esh fi al-hujum."" (And the police said that it resembles the involvement of the Islamic State organization in the attack.)

This directly indicates the police (ashurta) are suspecting involvement from Daesh. The other options are not identified as having suspicions about the perpetrators.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...منعت فلوريدا جميع ممثليها الخمسين لـ رومني..."" which translates to ""...Florida gave all of its fifty representatives to Romney..."" This means Romney secured all of Florida's delegates.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 32 mn mndwby alwlayh** (32 of the state's delegates) - The text says *all* 50.
* **B: trshyh alhzb aljmhwry** (the Republican nomination) - While this win *helps* him towards the nomination, it doesn't guarantee it yet. The text states he's considered the ""leading candidate,"" but not the nominee.
* **D: 46 fi alma2eh mn alaswa6** (46 percent of the votes) - This is the *percentage* of votes he received, not what he *obtained* as a result of winning Florida.

The text states: ""و حَلَّ Newt Gingrich راءس مجلس النواب الأمريكي السابق في المرتبة الثانية بنسبة 32 بالمئة"" which translates to ""Newt Gingrich, the former Speaker of the US House of Representatives, came in second place with 32 percent of the votes.""
"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, mn alazy lm ystmr fi altrsh7 b3d nta2ej almu2tmr al7zby?","The correct answer is **B: Bachmann**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""قررت بشمان، التي فازت باستطلاع أميس سترو في أغسطس، إنهاء حملتها."" (Bashman, who won the Ames Straw poll in August, ended her campaign.)

This directly states that Bachmann withdrew from the race after the results of the caucus/convention. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gingrich:** The text says Gingrich *conceded* to Santorum but faced negative ads from Romney, indicating he continued campaigning.
* **C: Perry:** Perry said he was going back to Texas to reassess, but also stated he would remain in the race and compete in South Carolina.
* **D: Romney:** Romney was running negative ads, showing he was actively campaigning, not withdrawing.



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, mn athna 3ela mrsh7 a5ar b2d ntyjh almu2tmr al7zby?","The correct answer is **D: Perry**.

This translates to: ""Perry decided he 'will return to Texas to assess the results of the party conference tonight and determine if there is a chance for a comeback this morning, but he is determined to stay in the race and compete on January 21 in South Carolina.'"" 

This clearly indicates Perry was reassessing his campaign *after* the results of the conference, meaning he was considering dropping out.  The other options didn't mention reassessing their campaigns based on the results.



"

Here's why:

The text states: ""في أيامه الأولى لم يعرض البرنامج إلا عبر مواقع البث الإذاعي الحي المدا عبر الإنترنت TogiNet Radio وهو مواقع يركز على البرامج الإذاعية."" (In its early days, the program was only broadcast through live radio broadcasting sites on the internet TogiNet Radio, which is a site focusing on radio programs.)

This clearly indicates that TogiNet Radio was the *only* place the program appeared before 2015.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: East Texas:** East Texas is mentioned as the origin of the voice actors, not the broadcast location.
*   **C: radyo AstroNet:** AstroNet was founded *in* late 2015, so it wasn't around before then.
*   **D: محطة إذاعية محلية (m76at eza3eyh m7lyh - local radio station):** The text specifically says it *wasn't* on local radio stations initially, only on TogiNet Radio.

The text states the station's website describes it as a ""masra7 edha3i madrasi qadim fi dhil tawajud ta7awul jadid gharib al-atwar qad tawajaza al-7udud"" – meaning an ""old school broadcast stage under the existence of a new, *strange* transformation that has gone beyond boundaries.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: mbtde2 (مبتدئ - beginner/initial)**: While the station *started* small, the description focuses on the *nature* of its transformation, not its starting point.
*   **C: 3la altry8a al8dimh (على الطريقة القديمة - in the old way)**: The text specifically mentions a *new* transformation, contradicting this option.
*   **D: ma7ly (محلي - local)**:  While the program initially featured local talent, the description highlights the oddness of its overall change, not simply its locality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **C: almsl7wn (the armed):** He wasn't one of the attackers.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Wasala al-muhajimun li Mumbai 3ala matni **qarib** fi 26 November 2008...""  ""Qarib"" means ""boat.""  The passage explicitly says the attackers arrived *by boat*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: alta2erh (the suggestion/proposal)** -  This doesn't relate to a mode of transportation.
* **C: al8arb (the war)** - While the attacks were a serious event, the question asks *how they traveled*.
* **D: alsyarh (the explanation)** -  This is about providing information, not a method of travel.

The text states: ""Wa qad khasira mu2akharan amama Raonic fi iftita7iyat Brisbane.""  This translates to ""He recently lost to Raonic in the opening of Brisbane."" 

Therefore, Raonic won the match.  The other options are incorrect:

* **C:** The text explicitly states Nadal *lost* to Raonic.
* **D:** 76 points were won by Nadal on his first serve, not by Raonic overall.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: hsd Raonic n8a6 3la alshbkh bnsbh 88%** (Raonic won points on the net by 88%) - The text doesn't mention Raonic's net play.
* **C: kant alnatyjh 7-2** (The result was 7-2) - This refers to Nadal's win *against another opponent* (al Kamadiy), not Raonic.
* **D: faz Raonic 3la Nadal** (Raonic won against Nadal) - The text specifically states Nadal *lost* to Raonic in Brisbane. However, it doesn’t give the score of that match.

Here's why:

The text states Naked News will launch programs in Spanish, Korean, and Italian. It *already* provides reports in English and Japanese. Therefore, Italian is the only language from the options that is being *added* in the new expansion, meaning it wasn't previously used.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: alkwryh (Korean):** The text says a program *will be launched* in Korean.
*   **C: alyabanyh (Japanese):** The text states they *already* present reports in Japanese.

The text states: ""فاشilat 45 min 117 mutazalija fi siba9 Jiant Slalom"" which translates to ""45 of 117 skiers failed to complete the Giant Slalom race.""

Therefore, 45 skiers did not finish the Giant Slalom race.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""فاشilat 45 min 117 mutazalija fi siba9 Jiant Slalom"" which translates to ""45 competitors from 117 did not finish their runs in the Giant Slalom race.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

The passage states the NBA *suspended its season* (""alghat al-NBA yawm al-arbu3a2 mawsamaha li kurat assala..."") because of concerns about COVID-19.  The question asks what prompted the NBA to take this action.  The season's suspension is the direct result.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: la3eb Utah Jazz (Utah Jazz player)** - While a player on the Utah Jazz *triggered* the decision, it wasn't the player themselves that was suspended.
* **C: ay la3eb y7hsl 3la ntyjh eyjabyh fi a5tbar virus covid-19 (any player who tests positive for COVID-19)** -  This is a *reason* for the action, not the action itself.
* **D: fry8 Utah Jazz lkrh alslh (Utah Jazz basketball team)** - The team wasn't suspended, the *season* was.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Wa ja2a qarar al-NBA ba3da an uthbitat isabat la3ib fariq Utah Jazz bil Virus."" (And the NBA's decision came after a player from the Utah Jazz team was infected with the virus.)

This directly translates to a positive test result for a Utah Jazz player being the reason for the NBA's concern and subsequent action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While tests were likely done, the passage doesn't state the *results* of tests from the league generally, only a specific player.
* **B:** The passage only mentions *one* player being infected, not ""many"" players.
* **C:**  The passage says the player was *infected* (uthbitat isabat), not that they felt weak (ada2eh d3eyfaan).  Feeling weak could be a symptom, but the trigger was the positive test.

The text states: ""Wa kanat al-tamrira al-7asima al-ula fi muabarat al-layla min Ovechkin hiya hadaf al-fawz al-ladhi sajalahu Nicklas Backstrom;"" which translates to ""And the first assist of the night from Ovechkin was the winning goal scored by Nicklas Backstrom.""

Therefore, Nicklas Backstrom scored the winning goal for the Washington Capitals.



"
mn sjl hdfh alstyn haza almwsm 5lal mbarah Capitals dd Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The text states: ""Wa kana hadafahu al-thani fi al-mubarat huwa al-hadaf raqam 60 fi hadha al-mawasem li yusbi7a awal la3eb yusajjel 60 hadafan aw akthar fi mawsamin wa7ed..."" (And his second goal in the match was the 60th goal of this season, becoming the first player to score 60 or more goals in a single season...)

The text clearly indicates Alex Ovechkin scored his 60th goal of the season in this game. The other players (Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr) are mentioned only as players who *also* achieved this feat in the past (1995-96). Nicklas Backstrom assisted on a goal, but didn't score it.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""I7taja Northen Rock ila adda3im bi-sabab 3ajzihi khilal azmat arrahin al-3iqari 3am 2007."" (Northern Rock needed support because of its inability during the 2007 mortgage crisis.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: b3d t2amym al-bank** (after the bank's nationalization) - Nationalization *was* a result of needing support, not the cause.
*   **B: 3ndma anfsl al-bank 3n shrkh edarh alaswl** (when the bank was separated from the bad asset company) - This was a *consequence* of the crisis and support, not the reason for it.
*   **C: b3d an ashtrt mjmw3eh Virgin al-bank** (after Virgin Group bought the bank) - Virgin didn't buy the *whole* bank, just the good assets. The need for support came *before* Virgin's involvement.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Ishtarat Virgin al-usul arrabi7a faqat min Notheren Rock wa laysa usul al-idara."" which translates to ""Virgin purchased only the profitable assets from Northern Rock and not the managing assets.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The text says Virgin *didn't* buy the bank after its nationalization.
* **C:** While Virgin *did* offer support, the text focuses on the eventual asset purchase, not just the offer.
* **D:** The offer came *before* the nationalization, not after.

This translates to: ""Mr. Rudd's decision to sign the Kyoto climate agreement isolates the United States, making it the only developed country that will not ratify this agreement.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: alhnd (India):** The text states India *isn't* bound by emissions targets.
*   **C: Australia:**  The text states the *previous* conservative Australian government rejected Kyoto, but this is a past action.  The current government (under Rudd) *is* signing it.
*   **D: al-Sin (China):** The text states China *isn't* bound by emissions targets.

The text states: ""Rafadat al-7ukuma al-Usturaliya al-mu7afidha assabiqa al-tasdiq 3ala protokol Kyoto, qa2ilatan innahu sayadirru bi al-iqtisad..."" which translates to ""The previous conservative Australian government rejected the ratification of the Kyoto protocol, stating that it would harm the economy...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: alwlayat almthdh (the United States)** - While the text mentions the US not ratifying, the Australian government's *reason* for rejection isn't about the US.
*   **C: alsadrat al fa7am (coal exports)** - The text *mentions* coal exports as a specific way the economy would be harmed, but the overarching concern is the economy itself.
*   **D: ahdaf alblad ll anb3eathat (the country's emissions targets)** - The text doesn't suggest the government rejected it because of the targets themselves, but because of the economic impact.



"

Here's why:

The text states: ""...في إطار برنامج الأسعد الذي التابع لجمعية الرمّاح الرياضيين (NSW).""  This directly translates to ""...within the framework of the program belonging to the Australian Sporting Shooters Association (NSW).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: برنامج جمعية الرمّاح الرياضيين في أستراليا:** While close, the text specifically mentions the *NSW* branch of the association.
* **B: برنامج الحفاظ على المنتزهات والتراث التابع له:** This is the overarching organization (NPWS) involved, but not the program the volunteers were recruited *through*.
* **C: برنامج NPWS:**  NPWS is a partner, not the program itself.



"

Here's why:

* **The question asks for something that *doesn't* reflect the purpose of the pest control experiment.** The entire passage focuses on *monitoring and evaluating* the effectiveness of the experiment.  Saying it wasn't evaluated directly contradicts that purpose.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: tlqa almtlqwn ershadat tdrybyh** (The shooters received training instructions) - The passage *explicitly* states the four shooters received comprehensive safety and training instructions. This *is* part of a controlled experiment.
* **C: ashrf alhras 3la almtlqyn** (The guards supervised the shooters) -  The passage states the forest guards were supposed to supervise the shooters as part of the experiment. This *is* reflecting the purpose.
* **D: tm akhtyar arb3 syadyn** (Three shooters were selected) - The passage states *four* shooters were selected. This is a factual detail *within* the experiment.



Therefore, the lack of evaluation is the element that doesn't align with the stated goal of monitoring and assessing the experiment's effectiveness."
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ayn 3uthr 3la alanshqaq?","The correct answer is **A: fi ryft faly** (in the Rift Valley).

Here's why:

The text states the researcher from Rift Valley Research in Ethiopia said ""This means everything must be re-examined."" This is *because* the split/rift (inqisam/anshqaq) is much more complex than previously thought, and the research is happening *in* the Rift Valley.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 3la hfryh (on the excavation):** While the text mentions an excavation (7afriya), the impact of the split isn't *on* the excavation itself, but in the location of the Rift Valley.
* **C: 3la dlyl jzy2ey (on partial evidence):**  The partial evidence (adila juzay2iya) *led* to the underestimation of the split, but the split itself isn't *on* the evidence.
* **D: fi Ethiopia (in Ethiopia):**  Ethiopia is where the research is *taking place*, but the split is specifically happening within the Rift Valley *within* Ethiopia.

* The question asks what happened *earlier* than expected. The passage directly states the *inqisam* (split/fissure) did.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aktshaf alhfryh (the excavation discovery):**  The excavation *revealed* the earlier split, but wasn't the event that happened earlier.
* **C: t7lyl aldlyl aljzy2ey (analysis of partial evidence):** The analysis led to the conclusion, but isn't the event itself.

Here's why:

The text states the device uses two sensors positioned *near the controller* to determine its position in 3D space. This means the player needs to ensure those sensors are properly positioned relative to the controller for the motion tracking to work.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: t7dyd mwq3eh** (Determine your position) - While the device *tracks* your position, the player doesn't actively *determine* it; the sensors do.
* **C: wd3 ajhzh astsh3ear balqrb mn tlfzywnh** (Place sensors near your TV) - The text specifically states the sensors are near the *controller*, not the TV.
* **D: 7arek aljhaz fi alhwa2** (Move the device in the air) - While the text mentions moving the device in the air, it's *because* of the sensors tracking its movement, not as a preliminary step.  The movement is a result of the system working, not a requirement to *make* it work.



"

Here's why:

The text states the control device ""Yastakhdimu mustash3irayn mawdu3ayn bil-qurub min tilfaz al-mustakhdam..."" which translates to ""uses two sensors placed near the user's body..."". This directly refers to the sensors being the key component that makes the remote-like control possible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: jihaz t7km Nintendo Revolution** - This is the name of the console, not specifically the remote-like control.
* **C: almut7dth alr2eysy** -  This translates to ""the main speaker"" and refers to Satoru Iwata, not the device.
* **D: jihaz Nintendo Revolution** - Again, this refers to the console itself.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Wa afadat attaqarir fima ba3d anna atta2ira talaqat tahdidan yufidu bi-wujud..."" (And reports later indicated that the plane received a threat regarding the presence...). This directly translates to the plane receiving a bomb threat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: hb6t alta2erh fi Urumqi** (The plane landed in Urumqi): The passage states it *attempted* an emergency landing in Urumqi, but didn't confirm a successful landing.
*   **C: tm t7wyl msar alta2erh ela Afghanistan** (The plane's course was changed to Afghanistan):  This is stated, but it's a *result* of something else, not the initial unreported information.
*   **D: hb6t alta2erh fi Kandahar** (The plane landed in Kandahar): The passage says it was *heading* towards Kandahar, not that it landed there.



Therefore, the information about the bomb threat is the detail the report initially lacked, making **A** the correct answer."
ma aldy lm yrd fi altqryr alawl lwkalh anba2 Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **A: tm akhttaf alta2erh (the plane was hijacked)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Wa kanat wikalat al-anba2 assiniya (Xinhua) qad dhakarat fi waqtin sabiq anahu sayatim ikhtitaf ta2ira.""  This directly translates to ""And the Chinese news agency (Xinhua) had previously reported that a plane was hijacked.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: mun3et alta2erh mn alhbwt aladtrary (the plane recovered from an emergency landing)** - This information comes *later* in the report, after the initial report of hijacking.
* **C: tm t7wyl msar alta2erh lt23wd ela Afghanistan (the plane's course was changed to return to Afghanistan)** - This is also a later development in the story.
* **D: tlqt al6a2erh thdydaan bwjwd qnblh (the plane launched a threat of a bomb)** - The passage states it *received* a threat, not that it launched one.

Therefore, the initial report from Xinhua, as stated in the passage, was about the hijacking.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states Sara Danyus said they've ceased efforts to reach Bob Dylan after failing to contact him regarding his 2016 Nobel Prize. She details attempts to contact his close associates via phone and email, and their unresponsive replies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: alfa2ez bja2ezh Nobel ll2dab** (Giving up on the Nobel Prize for Literature) - While implied, the text focuses on giving up *contacting Dylan*, not the prize itself.
* **B: lm ttlq alljnh ay rdwd mn almt3eawnyn** (The committee received no responses from collaborators) -  The text states they *did* receive responses, but they were ""friendly but dismissive.""

The text states the Nobel Committee for Literature gave up trying to reach **Bob Dylan** after failing to contact him regarding his 2016 Nobel Prize.  The passage specifically mentions their inability to *attaswul ma3ahou* (contact him).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aqrb almt3eawnyn m3 Bob Dylan (Bob Dylan's closest associates):** While they *were* contacted, the issue was that they didn't get a response *from Bob Dylan*. They were reachable, but he wasn't.

* **C: al- Akadimiyya Assuwaydiya (The Swedish Academy):**  They attempted to reach him through Sara Danius and others, but couldn't.  They aren't the unreachable party.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""Wa wasafa al-muta7adith bi-ism Bush, **Gordon Johndroe**, ta3ahud kuriya al-shamaliyya..."" which translates to ""And the spokesman for Bush, **Gordon Johndroe**, described North Korea's pledge...""

The question (Q) asks who called the pledge a ""important step.""  The passage directly identifies Gordon Johndroe as the one who made that description.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: alshafh (the speaker):** Too vague. While Johndroe *is* a speaker, the question wants a specific name.
*   **B: George W. Bush:** The passage says Johndroe spoke *for* Bush, not that Bush himself made the statement.
*   **D: mt7dth basm kuriya al-shamaliyya (spokesman for North Korea):** The pledge came *from* North Korea, and Johndroe was *commenting on* it. He wasn't speaking *for* North Korea.

While the text mentions stamp #1000, that's a specific stamp, not the total number of *different* stamps produced for different countries."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kan 3rd myah alfydanat 100 qadam** (The water width in the third district was 100 feet) - The passage mentions 100 feet as the *height* the water poured *over* the dam, not the width of the flood.

Here's why:

This *directly addresses* the concern of preventing further spread, implying they are taking steps to mitigate the *possibility* of others getting infected. Hamilton did *not* deny this possibility; instead, the actions taken indicate they are actively working to prevent it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mkan sfr almryd (the patient's travel location):** The passage clearly states the patient visited Nigeria. Hamilton confirmed this.
* **C: ma eda kan qd tm atba3e al-protocol almonasb (whether the proper protocol was followed):** The passage states ""Ittaba3a al-mustashfa brutukul mukafa7iti al-3adwa"" (The hospital followed infection control protocols). Hamilton confirmed this.
* **D: alhalh alhalyh llmryd (the patient's current condition):** The passage says the patient is in stable condition (""fi-7ala mustaqirra""). Hamilton confirmed this.

* **D: tmkn almswr mn alhswl 3la swrh li Bieber** (The photographer managed to get a picture of Bieber) - The text doesn't say he *got* a picture of Bieber, only that he was likely trying to photograph the police presence related to Bieber.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: yrkn syarth fi shar3 Sepulveda Boulevard** (parking his car on Sepulveda Boulevard) - While true, this was *before* he attempted to do something that led to the accident.
* **C: 3bwr tryq sry3 mzdhm** (crossing a busy highway) - He was *about to* cross, but hadn't yet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: la ysh3er ba2nh b7alh jydh** (He doesn't feel good) - While he mentions symptoms, he *also* says he feels good and able to work remotely (""illa annani ash3uru bi-khayr wa fi 7ala jayyida lil muzawalat 3amali 3an bu3ud"").
* **B: ldyh althab fi al7lq** (He has inflammation in the throat) - He mentions throat inflammation (""iltihab al-7alq"") but this doesn't describe his overall condition.

* **The text states:** ""illa annani ash3uru bi-khayr wa fi 7ala jayyida lil muzawalat 3amali 3an bu3ud."" ( ""...but I feel well and in good condition to work remotely."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: lys ldyh 7uma** (He doesn't have a fever) - The text says ""Bi-saref annadhar 3an al-7umma"" (Regardless of the fever), implying he *did* have a fever, but it's not the primary concern now.

* **D: ldyh 7alh khtyrh mn al-virus** (He has a severe case of the virus) - The text states ""tamma tathbit isabat...bi-7ala khafifa"" (a mild case was confirmed), so it's not severe.

Here's why:

The text states ""Wa min al-mutwaqqa3 an tastamira bil inkhifad"" (It is expected to continue to decrease) *after* mentioning the wind speed was 83 kilometers per hour. This directly implies the weakening/decrease is expected to continue *from that point*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: qbl alwswl ela al-Maldives** (Before reaching the Maldives): The text doesn't tie the weakening to reaching the Maldives.
*   **C: qbl an ysl ela drwth** (Before reaching its peak): The text describes it *at* its peak, and *then* states it's expected to weaken.
*   **D: qbl wswl sr3eh alryah ela 149 mylaan fi alsa3a** (Before the wind speed reached 149 miles per hour): The weakening is expected *after* the peak speed, not before.



"
ma hy sr3eh alryah fi drwh e3sar jwnw almdary?,"The correct answer is **A: 149 kilometer fi alsa3a**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""wasalat sur3atuha ila 240 kilometran fi sa3a (149 milan fi sa3a)."" This translates to ""its speed reached 240 kilometers per hour (149 miles per hour).""  The question asks for the speed *in kilometers per hour*, and 149 is given as the equivalent speed in miles per hour. However, the passage *also* directly states the speed in kilometers: 240 km/h, but this option is not available. Thus, the closest answer that is given is A: 149 km/h.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 240 mile fi alsa3a** - The passage gives 240 *kilometers* per hour, not miles.
*   **C: 149 mile fi alsa3a** - While 149 is a speed mentioned, it's the equivalent in *miles*, not the speed itself.
*   **D: 83 kilometer fi alsa3a** - This was the *previous* wind speed, not the current peak speed of the cyclone.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Karenia brevis, wa huwa ka2in ba7riy **wa7id al-khaliyya**..."" (Karenia brevis, which is a marine **single-celled** organism...)

Therefore, it's *not* multi-cellular. Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: hw nw3e mn al67aleb** (It is a type of algae) - The passage says it *produces* toxins, making it related to harmful algal blooms, so this is a characteristic of it.
* **B: ymkn an yshl a3esab albshr** (It can paralyze humans) - The passage says it can affect humans through inhalation of the aerosols it creates, implying it can cause harm.
* **D: hw tby3ey almnsha** (It is naturally occurring) - The passage states it occurs naturally (""ya7duthu bi-shakl tabi3iy"").



"
ay mma yly la ystty3 Karenia brevis alqyam bh?,"The correct answer is **A: shl ala3esab fi alasmak (causing paralysis in fish)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ghaliban ma tamut al-asmak bi-sabab tarkiz 3ali min al-sumum fil miyah."" (Fish often die due to high concentrations of toxins in the water). This means *Karenia brevis* causes death, not paralysis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: alzyadh alsry3eh fi al3edd t7t ay zrf (rapid increase in numbers under any circumstances)**: The passage says natural factors can *cause* rapid increases in its numbers (""Yumiknu an tatdakhal al-3wamil al-tabi3iyya lil sama7 bi-tazayud a3dad al-ta7alib bi-shaklin sari3"").
* **C: y2ethr 3la almyah (affecting the water)**:  It *does* affect the water by releasing toxins (""tuntij suman 3a9abiyan yumkinuhu t36yl al-a39ab fy kul min al-bashar walasmak."").
* **D: entaj sm 3asby (producing potent toxins)**: The passage clearly states it *produces* toxins (""Tuntij al-6a7alib suman 3a9abiyan..."").



Therefore, paralysis in fish is the one thing the passage *doesn't* attribute to *Karenia brevis*."

This translates to: ""Its remnants caused heavy rains across most of the island, *despite the fact that until now there have been no reports of any damage or flooding*.""

Therefore, the passage specifically states that *no flooding* has been reported as a result of the storm.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: htwl alamtar almfyd** (the useful rainfall): The passage mentions rainfall was ""useful"" in terms of measurement, but doesn't say it didn't *cause* anything.
*   **B: htwl alamtar mshwbh balr3ed** (rainfall accompanied by thunder): The passage *does* mention thunderstorms.
*   **C: albrq almtkrr** (repeated lightning): The passage *does* mention repeated lightning.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Felicia *was* a Category 4 hurricane.** It *started* as a hurricane, and then weakened to a tropical depression (mnkhfad istiwa2i).  The option incorrectly states it *became* a hurricane *after* being a low-pressure system.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: astfadt Oahu mn htwl alamtar alnatj** (Oahu benefited from the resulting rainfall) - The passage mentions rainfall across the island, implying benefit to places like Oahu.
* **C: shhdt m3ezm aljzr htwl alamtar** (The entire island witnessed rainfall) -  ""Tasabbabatt ba8ayaha fy hu6wl am6ar fy mu3'6am al-jazira"" (Its remnants caused widespread rainfall across most of the island) supports this.

Here's why:

The passage states ""2uqila Piquet Jr. ba3da ja2izat al-majar al-kubra 3am 2009"" - which translates to ""Piquet Jr. was fired after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix."" This directly reflects the outcome of the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix for Piquet Jr.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: t3rd Fernando Alonso l7adth (Fernando Alonso caused an incident)** - The passage describes an incident *affecting* Alonso, not caused by him.
*   **B: hqq Piquet Jr. alnsr (Piquet Jr. deserved the victory)** - The passage discusses a controversial win by Alonso, and Piquet Jr.'s subsequent firing.
*   **D: t3erdt syarh al2aman l7adth (The safety car was exposed to an incident)** - The passage mentions the safety car being deployed, but doesn't focus on it being ""exposed to an incident.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: mbashrh b3d twqf alwnsw** (immediately after Alonso's stop) - The text doesn't say it happened *immediately* after Alonso stopped, but rather *while another car was refueling*.
*   **C: qbl khrwj syarh al2aman** (before the safety car came out) - The event happened *under* the safety car, not before it.

* **It *doesn't* state:** The actual *name* of this new species.  The report focuses on the *process* of speciation, not the identification by name.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **C: fi jmy3 an7a2 jnwb shrq Orobba** (in all areas of southeastern Europe) - The text says Bucharest is the *first* city, implying it's not happening everywhere.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ""y7dth fqt fi almdn alty t3etbr """"ebda3eyh"""" ""** (Happens only in cities considered ""creative"") - While Bucharest *is* aiming to be a creative city, the text doesn't say CowParade *only* happens in creative cities.

* **C: hw 7dth fny yqam fi alsyf fi jmy3 an7a2 jnwb shrq Orobba** (It is an art event that takes place in the summer in all of southeastern Europe) - The text specifies it's happening in *Bucharest*, not all of southeastern Europe.

This translates to ""...an engine separated during takeoff, but without any damage, which forced Russia to temporarily suspend the operation of the Il-76 aircraft.""

The accident (7adth) is the direct reason given for the suspension.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: alqwat aldakhlyh (internal forces):**  While the text mentions internal forces were *investigating* the incident, they didn't *cause* the suspension.
*   **C: aljysh alsoviti (Soviet army):** The Soviet army's use of the plane historically is irrelevant to the current suspension.
*   **D: thqyq mu3lq (suspended investigation):** The investigation is a *result* of the incident, not the cause of the suspension.



"

Here's why:

* The text repeatedly refers to ""ta2irat ll-76"" (طائرة إل-76).  ""Ta2ira"" means airplane or aircraft. The text describes its engine failure and temporary grounding.
* The question asks ""ma hy II-76?"" which translates to ""what is II-76?"". The text provides context that II-76 is an airplane.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 8wash (وشاح):**  Means ""scarf"" - completely unrelated.
* **B: dbabh (ضباط):** Means ""officers"" - also unrelated.
* **D: qtar (قطار):** Means ""train"" - not what the text is about.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma aldy lm yrghb b3d alnas fi an tt7dth 3nh alnsa2?","The correct answer is **A: alafrad al-zokor (men)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Fluke's efforts to prevent women from talking about their experiences with birth control *failed* because she received ""positive feedback and encouragement...from men and women alike who urged her to consider birth control medication as a medical necessity.""  This implies that *some* people initially didn't want women to discuss this topic, and those people were men.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: altkalyf altbyh (the wealthy classes):** The passage doesn't mention anything about class.
* **C: shh alnsa2 (women themselves):** The passage explicitly states women *encouraged* her, not discouraged her.

Therefore, according to the passage, Titan is the celestial body with the *second* most dynamism, making it the most dynamic of the options given *except* for Planet Ared (which isn't a choice).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: alard (Earth)** - The passage doesn't mention Earth having more dynamism than Titan.
*   **C: alshms (The Sun)** - While dynamic, the passage specifically compares things *to* Titan, not *to* the Sun.

This establishes Titan as a relevant body being discussed.
* **The passage describes a transparent liquid:** The first part of the passage ( ""Sa-yatasarraf mithla al-ma2. Fa innahu shaffaf kama al-ma2 tamaman..."") describes a substance that behaves like water and is completely transparent.  
* **Titan has liquid methane/ethane seas:** Titan is known to have lakes and seas made of liquid methane and ethane, which *are* transparent. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: almshtry (Jupiter):** Jupiter is a gas giant, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. It doesn't have surface liquids like transparent seas.
* **C: alshms (The Sun):** The Sun is a star made of plasma, not liquids.

(Scientists say that the color of this animal's feather is chestnut brown from above with a pale or reddish underside.)  This is a *description* of the feather, not a *discovery* made *because* of the feather's discovery. It's information *about* the feather, not a conclusion drawn *from* finding it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: fhm an alrysh lm ystkhdm fi altyran (understanding that the feather wasn't used for flight)** - The passage *does* state the feather structure suggests it wasn't for flight, making this a result of the discovery.
* **C: nzrh 3la ttwr alrysh (a look at the evolution of feathers)** -  The passage explicitly mentions the discovery provides insight into feather evolution: ""Yamna7u al-iktishaf aydan nazratan thaqibatan li-tatawur al-rish lida al-tuyur.""

"

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Nazarn li 3adam i7tiwa2 rish al-diynasurat 3ala 3amud fiqari mutatawir, yusmma """"rachis""""...""  This translates to: ""They noticed the dinosaur feather did not contain a developed spinal column, called """"rachis""""...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: alqsybat alsghra** (small branches) - The text discusses the feather *having* features like filaments, not lacking branches.
* **C: rysh balgh** (developed feather) - The text actually *states* the sample shows a developed feather!
* **D: janb sfly shahb allwn** (pale lower side) - This describes a *characteristic* of the feather's color, not something it lacks.

(Despite some promising leads in reducing mortality from Ebola, no drugs have yet been proven effective in treating the existing infection.)  This directly contradicts option B, which claims ZMapp *can* treat the infection.
* **Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:**
    * **A: hw msnw3 mn ajsam mdadh** (It is made of antibodies) - The text mentions ""koktel al-ajsam al-mudhadda"" (cocktail of antibodies) referring to ZMapp.

(Official studies indicated it was less effective than needed in reducing mortality.)



Therefore, option B is the only statement that contradicts the information given in the text."

This translates to: ""...in low-income countries, where survival rates for diseases like breast cancer could be half of those in wealthier countries.""

This clearly indicates the researchers believe the new strip will be *most* important in low-income countries due to its potential to improve early detection and thus survival rates.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Wa hadha yushiru ila anna al-a7dath al-jawiyya al-lati antajatha kanat 7aditha ila 7adden ma."" (And this indicates that the atmospheric events that produced them were relatively recent).  This directly supports the idea that the formations are likely due to recent events.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: wjwdhm y3ny an alqmr la yftqr ela alnshat aljywlwjy** (their existence means the moon does not lack geological activity): The passage *challenges* the idea that the moon is completely geologically inactive, it doesn't *confirm* it. It highlights a contradiction to that belief.
* **C: qd tkwn ntyjh ltqls alqmr** (they may be a result of the moon's contraction): While the passage mentions contraction (""taqallus al-qamar""), it presents it as a *possible cause* of the formations, not a definitive conclusion.
* **D: lm yu3ethr 3la alkthyr mnha 3la sth alqmr** (they didn’t affect much on the moon’s surface): The passage describes significant formations (""ashkalan ardiyyatan mutanathiratan"") *on* the lunar surface.

(And this indicates that the atmospheric events that produced it were recent to a certain extent.)  This directly supports the idea that the formations (the ""nadabat al-fissiyya"") are relatively new.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: alqmr ytqls bbt2 (The moon contracts slowly):** While the passage *mentions* contraction as a possible cause, it doesn't frame that as the theory regarding geological activity.
* **B: nshat altdarys mnd wqt twyl (The formations are from a long time ago):** This contradicts the passage's implication of recent activity.
* **C: la ywjd swa kmyh d2eylh mn altdarys 3la s67 alqmr (There is only a small amount of formations on the moon's surface):** The passage describes widespread formations across the entire lunar surface (""fi kul an7a2 sati7 al-qamar"").

(The Public Prosecution Office, responsible for legal investigations, told journalists that no comment should be made at least until charges are filed.)  While this refers to *commentary*, the preceding sentences specifically discuss the concern about publishing pictures and how the court considers it potentially prejudicial.  The overall context indicates the restriction is about *any* public dissemination of information, especially images, until charges are formally laid.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: t3elyqat edafyh (additional comments):** The passage does mention comments, but the restriction isn't solely on ""additional"" comments – it's on *any* comment.
*   **C: mnaqshat adlh shhwd al3eyan (discussion of eyewitness evidence):** The passage mentions eyewitness evidence being potentially compromised but doesn't state a prohibition on *discussing* it.

* **D: zwban aljlyd (ذوبان الجليد)** - the melting of the ice. The passage doesn't mention the ice melting; it focuses on the cold and severe weather.

Here's why:

The passage states Roberts ""emphasized the importance of settled Supreme Court precedent,"" specifically referencing *Roe v. Wade* as ""established law."" He reiterated his prior statement about its stability.  His reluctance to overturn *Roe* is directly tied to his belief in respecting established Supreme Court rulings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

The passage states Roberts believes questioning the stability of established Supreme Court precedent (""qanun al-ared al-mustaqir"") is fundamentally against the principles of judicial legitimacy. He feels it's wrong to even *begin* a discussion about when the court *should* overturn its rulings.  He repeatedly emphasized the importance of consistent rulings from the Supreme Court.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: fi mntsf alnhar** (at noon) - The text mentions a memorial garden ""fi al-muntasaf"" (in the middle), but this refers to the *location* of the garden, not when construction happens.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that the temperature fluctuations within ""The Seven Sisters"" are *similar to those found in caves* – being cooler during the day and warmer at night. This is a key characteristic of caves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: qtr mdakhl alkhf (diameter of the cave entrance):** While the text mentions the size of the entrances (328-820 feet), this doesn't *prove* they are caves, just that they are large openings.
* **C: alms7 aljywlwjy (the geological survey):** Glen Cushing's statement acknowledges they are *not* typical caves with stable temperatures, but still doesn’t definitively confirm they *are* caves. He suggests they are ""deep holes"".
* **D: swr alkhwf 3la alard (cave images on the ground):** This refers to visual patterns, and isn’t proof of the features being caves.



Therefore, the fluctuating temperatures mirroring those of caves are the strongest indicator mentioned in the text that ""The Seven Sisters"" are cave-like formations."

The passage states: ""تُظهر صور الأشعة تحت الحمراء أن متغيرات الحرارة من الليل إلى النهار شبيهة بتلك في الكهوف."" (Images taken under the red show that temperature variations from night to day are similar to those in caves.)

This directly answers the question of how the thermal behavior of ""The Seven Sisters"" is observed - through infrared images.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: حفر عميق في الأرض** (deep holes in the ground): While the passage mentions they are deep, it doesn't describe this *as* how their behavior is observed.
* **C: قطر الخوف** (diameter of fear):  This is irrelevant to the passage.

The text states ""fu8dan al-jyrwskwb musba8an fy muhimati al-ma7a6ati al-fa'9a2ya"" which translates to ""loss of the gyroscope early in the vital orbital mission"".  A gyroscope is crucial for attitude control and therefore combat capability/functioning of the spacecraft. The rest of the passage describes efforts to *recover* from this loss - adjusting position, re-establishing a natural orientation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: al7ifaz 3la almsafh alsa7i7a mn aldaf3eat** (maintaining a safe distance from threats) - While mentioned, this is a *result* of the problem, not the problem itself.  They adjusted position *because* of the gyroscope failure.

The text states ""fu8dan al-jyrwskwb musba8an fy muhimati al-ma7a6ati al-fa'9a2ya"" which translates to ""the loss of the explosive device earlier in the dangerous reconnaissance mission.""  The entire passage describes the efforts to continue the mission *despite* losing this explosive.  Therefore, the primary goal of the reconnaissance mission is to locate the lost explosive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: alaqtrab mn daf3eat alt3edyl (approaching the adjustment defense):** While they mention being at a safe distance from a ""position adjustment engine,"" this isn't the *goal* of the mission.
* **C: ekmal syr fi alfda2 (completing the reconnaissance):** Completing the reconnaissance is a consequence of trying to achieve the goal, not the goal itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: fi asr3 wqt mmkn** (as soon as possible) - While 29% of those polled wanted this, it wasn't Gillard's stated position.
*   **C: abdaan** (never) - 31% felt this way, but again, not Gillard's view.

This translates to ""...Komen's policy regarding the Family Research Council because of the pending investigation into how the Family Research Council spends...""  and ""...Yu7aqeq Stearns fi ma edha kanat al-dara2eb tusta5dam li tamwil 3amaliyat al-ejhadh men 5ilal tandhim al-2usra..."" which means ""...Stearns is investigating whether taxes are used to fund operations of the Family Research Council...""

Therefore, the organization being investigated for legal issues is the Family Research Council (tandhim al-2usra).



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: lajnat a66aqa wa attijara fi majles annuwab (House Energy and Commerce Committee):** This committee *oversees* the investigation, but isn't the one *under* investigation.
*   **B: mu2asasat Komen (Komen Foundation):** Komen changed its policy *because of* the investigation into the Family Research Council, it isn't the subject of the investigation itself.

* **C: tandhim al-2usra (Family Planning Organization):** Stearns is investigating *this* organization, but he doesn't lead it.
* **D: alljnh alfr'eyh llrqabh walthqyqat (Subcommittee for Oversight and Investigation):**  While he *chairs* this subcommittee, it falls *under* the larger Committee on Appropriations and Commerce. The question asks which committee Stearns is the head of.

Here's why:

The text states the police *recovered* stolen mobile phones and laptops. However, it *doesn't* say they recovered the Syrian woman's belongings. It specifically mentions recovering *her* phone and laptops *in addition* to other stolen items. This implies her personal belongings beyond those were not recovered.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: t'erdt llqtl (she was subjected to murder):** The text doesn't mention any murder.
*   **C: t3ardt la23etda2 jnsy mn qbl 5 ashkhas (she was subjected to sexual assault by 5 people):** The text doesn't mention any sexual assault. It only states they ""assaulted the Syrian woman"" which could mean physical assault but not necessarily sexual assault.

The text explicitly states: ""لكننا الـ ASUS حصلت على جائزة تايوان المستدامة لعام 2007"" which translates to ""But ASUS obtained the Taiwan Sustainable Award for the year 2007"". 

Therefore, ASUS is the company that won the award."

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Asba7a jihaz ASUS Eee, al-ladhi tamma itlaquhu 3alamiyan fi waqtin sabiq li 3awamil tawfir al-takalif wal waza2if..."" which means ""ASUS Eee device, which was launched globally previously for cost-saving and functional factors...""  This indicates it's a *device*, and the context of ""portable computing"" in 2007 points to a laptop.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: hatf dky (هاتف ذكي):** Smart phone - The text doesn't mention phones.
    * **C: haswb lwhy (حاسوب لوحي):** Tablet - Tablets weren't mainstream in 2007 as they are today. The Eee PC was *precursor* to some tablet concepts, but wasn't a tablet itself.
    * **D: jhaz nda2 (جهاز نداء):** Call device/Pager - Completely irrelevant to the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: mjmw3a mn skan Obanazawa** (a group of Obanazawa residents) - The residents *complained* about the missing cards, they didn't *lose* them.

The text states: ""...*al-sabiy qad akhfa akthar min 600 wathiqa baridiyya...wa lati lam yatimmu taslimuha li as7abiha.*""  This translates to ""…the employee hid more than 600 postal documents…which were not delivered to their owners.""

While the post office *issued* an apology (maktab bryd Obanazawa), the *source* of the problem and therefore the one who should be held accountable for hiding the documents is the employee (alsby). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: alskan almhlywn (the residents):** They *received* the apology, but didn't issue it.
* **C: wsa2el ale3lam (the media):** They *received* information about the apology, but didn’t issue it.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Talaqa Porto 3ilijan li katifihi fi hadhihi al-mar7ala illa annahu tamkkana min mutaba3at al-mubarat.""  This translates to ""Porto received treatment for his shoulder at this stage, but he was able to continue the match.""  The text then directly links this treatment to happening *during* the second set (""fi hadhihi al-mar7ala"" refers to the context of Del Potro getting an early lead and then needing to fight back to 6-6 *in the second set*).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: khlal almjmw3a alawla (during the first set):** The text says Murray lost the first set, not that Del Potro needed treatment then.
*   **B: qbl shwt ksr alt3eadl alawl (before the first break point):** The text doesn’t mention treatment before any specific break point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: khsrh Del Potro b3d esabth** (Del Potro lost after injury) - The text doesn't say Del Potro lost. It mentions he received treatment but continued playing.
* **C: faz bh mwrary fi almjmw'eh althanyh** (Murray won in the second set) - The text says Del Potro had an early advantage in the second set, and it went to 6-6, implying a tiebreak, but doesn't state Murray *won* the set.
* **D: faz bh Del Potro fi almjmw'eh althanyh** (Del Potro won in the second set) - The text doesn't state Del Potro won the second set, just that he had an early advantage and it went to a tiebreak.

""  This translates to: ""The governor specifically mentioned: 'We learned today that some children in the school year were among those who survived the ordeal.'""

This directly indicates that children were the ones affected and on the verge of danger (""miman khala6w al-mari'9"" - those who survived the ordeal).

*   **A: alhakm** (the governor) - While the governor is *reporting* on the situation, he isn't the one *in* danger.
*   **C: ms'ewlw Texas** (Texas officials) - The passage mentions officials taking steps to protect the public, but doesn't say they were directly threatened.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Perry *said* ""Hadhihi al-7ala khatira"" (This situation is serious).** The question asks what assurance the governor *didn't* give.  He explicitly stated it *is* serious, so he didn't assure citizens it *isn't* serious.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: alnzam ya3ml bshkl jyd (the system works well):** Perry said, ""Kunu muta2akkidin min anna nidhamana ya3mal kama yanbaghi"" (Be sure our system is working as it should). This is a call for assurance, not an assurance *given*.

* **The passage states the purpose of purchasing the vehicles is ""li takhfif al-izdi7am"" (to alleviate the congestion).**  The entire announcement is about extending the commitment to fund more fire trucks *in order to* reduce congestion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: enha mltzmh btkhfyf mshklh alnql** (that it is committed to alleviating the transportation problem) - While easing congestion is the *result* of buying more vehicles, the announcement is about *funding* the vehicles, not directly addressing the transportation problem.
* **C: enha tkhtt ltmwyl 1300 3arbeh edafyh** (that it plans to fund 1300 additional vehicles) -  The passage states the *total* will be 1300, not that they're funding 1300 *more*.
* **D: sytm hl mshklh alaktzaz bhlwl mars** (this congestion problem will be solved by the end of March) - The passage doesn't say the problem will be solved, only that the purchase is intended to alleviate it.  It also doesn't mention a deadline of March.

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Wa qalat:""""la tujad ma3lumat istikhbaratiyya tushir ila tawaqu3 hujum washik""""."" (And she said: ""There is no intelligence information indicating an imminent attack."")  This implies a lowered threat level.
* **P continues:** ""Wa ma3a dhalik, fa inna khafid mustawa al-tahdid ila khatir la ya3ni anna al-tahdid al-shamel qad zala tamaman""""."" (However, lowering the threat level to moderate does not mean the overall threat has completely disappeared.) This *confirms* a lowering of the threat level while also cautioning it's not gone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: lm y'ed hnak ay thdyd (there is no threat)** - The passage explicitly states the overall threat hasn't disappeared, even with the lowered level.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Endala3at al-e7tijajat al-lati kanat 3anifa a7yanan"" which translates to ""The protests, which were violent at times..."". This directly addresses the nature of the protests being sometimes violent.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kant alljnh alr'easyh rdaan 3la alahtjajat** (The presidential committee responded to the protests) - While true, this doesn't describe the *nature* of the protests themselves, only the response to them.

* **C: wtalbt alahtjajat bastqalh almjls alantkhaby alm3qt alsabq** (The protests demanded the resignation of the previous temporary electoral council) - This is a *demand* made *during* the protests, not a description of their nature (violent, peaceful, etc.).

This translates to: ""And one of the presidential committees last month recommended the resignation of the previous provisional electoral council as part of a package of measures for the directors in the country to move towards holding new elections.""

Therefore, the presidential committee proposed the resignation of the previous CEP. While Martelly ultimately formed a new CEP, the *proposal* for the old one to resign came from the committee.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: martyly (Martelly):** While Martelly formed the new CEP, he didn't *propose* the resignation of the old one – the committee did.
*   **B: almhtjwn (the protesters):** The protests were a *result* of the electoral issues, but they didn't directly propose the CEP's resignation. They voiced demands.
*   **D: aqtrh a3eda2 majlis intikhaby mu2a8at (CEP) dlk banfshm (members of that electoral council themselves proposed it):** The text doesn't mention the CEP members proposing their own resignation; it says the committee recommended it.

This translates to: ""We agree with the statement of the American Olympic Committee (USOC) that it is possible to better support the issues of athletes and clubs and their sports, by moving forward towards meaningful change within the organization, instead of issuing certificates.""

This clearly indicates the US Gymnastics federation believes focusing on **changes within the organization** is more important than simply issuing certificates after the Larry Nassar scandal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: shb altrakhys (issuing licenses)** - The text explicitly says they prefer changes *over* issuing licenses.
* **B: ensha' by'eh qwyh (creating a strong environment)** - While a strong environment is the *goal*, the text focuses on *how* to achieve it: through organizational change.
* **D: thqyq mstql (independent investigation)** - While they support an independent investigation, the main point is the need for changes stemming from that investigation.

This translates to: ""Also, the custody of the captive ISIS fighters, whom European countries refused to take back according to the statement, will be taken over.""

Therefore, the statement explicitly says European countries refused to take responsibility for their captured fighters.

The text explicitly states: ""Waqa3a al-7adith fawqa irtifa3at 3aliya fi **mintaqa jabaliyya**"" which translates to ""The incident happened at high altitudes in a **mountainous region**.""

* **jblyh** is the Arabic word for mountainous.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **eda'eyh:**  (narrow) - Not mentioned in the text.
* **qasyh:** (harsh/severe) - While the conditions are difficult, this doesn't describe the *type* of terrain.
* **thalfyh:** (snowy) - The text mentions bad weather (""al-taqes assayi2"" - bad weather), but doesn't specifically mention snow.

This translates to ""…the officials are working to make that (the increased water level from the dam) sufficient to restore the eroded sandbars along the river course.""

The passage explicitly states that as a result of stopping the seasonal floods after the 1963 coup, a species of fish went extinct, and *another species, including the striped chub, faces extinction*.  The entire passage revolves around the ecological consequences of stopping the floods, and the striped chub is specifically mentioned as being at risk.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: qdban alrmal (sand bars):** The passage states the *lack* of floods prevents the *formation* of sand bars, not that the coup directly affected existing ones.  The hope is to *restore* them.
* **C: mwa'el alhyah albryh (wildlife habitats):** While the loss of sand bars impacts wildlife habitats, the passage specifically highlights the fish as a direct consequence.

The text (P) explicitly states the US received information about a threat of bombings in ""ma3alim bariza"" (prominent landmarks) in *both* Ethiopia (2athyubya) and Kenya (Kinya).

*   **A & D: tfjyr qnabl fi m3alm fi bld wahd / tfjyr qnabl fi bld wahd** (bombing in landmarks in one country / bombing in one country) - The text mentions *two* countries.

This translates to ""The famous Greek lawyers, Sakis Kecgagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos were imprisoned...""  Therefore, Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos *are* lawyers.

Petros Mantouvalos is described as ""3uduw al-barlaman wal mu7ami"" - a parliament member and a lawyer.

Makis Triantafylopoulos is described as a ""sa7afiy"" - a journalist. The text doesn't mention him being a lawyer.

The text explicitly states that judges (القضاة), and court secretaries (كاتبو العدل) were involved in illegal activities and corruption.  It also mentions a lawyer, Petros Mantouvalos, resigning due to his office's involvement in corruption. However, the text *directly* points to a broader issue of corruption within the *lawyers* (المحامون) as a whole, due to the implication that Mantouvalos' office was complicit.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: mhamw alejra'at (محامو الإجراءات - procedural lawyers):** This is too specific; the text discusses a general corruption issue, not just procedural aspects.
*   **B: alqdah (القضاة - judges):** While judges are definitely implicated, the scandal's scope *includes* more than just judges.
*   **C: alshafywn (الشهود - witnesses):** Witnesses aren't directly mentioned as being part of the corruption scheme.



The passage highlights corruption affecting the entire legal system, and it explicitly names lawyers who were involved or resigned because of it. Therefore, lawyers are the group not previously mentioned as part of the scandal within the Greek legal community."

This directly indicates that the website contained sexual content and that was what was being removed/addressed.

Here's why:

The text states that despite his personal belief that women shouldn't fight, Amir Khan said he *will support the British competitors in the 2011 Olympics held in London*.  Since the question asks what he will support *despite* his opinion, and 2011 Olympics in London are referenced, it's clear he'll support the athletes at the Olympics.  While the text mentions the 2004 Olympics in relation to his medal, it's not what he's supporting *despite* his view. The 2012 Olympics are the logical continuation since the event is held in London in 2012.

The passage explicitly states: ""nadiran ma yatim 7ajez assafar al jawwi mubasharatan 3abra shirkat attayaran min dun al ba7eth awwalan 3an al as3ar wa muqaranatiha"" - ""it is rare to book air travel directly through an airline without first searching for and comparing prices.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: albhth fi 'erwd shrkat alsfr almt3ddh** (searching offers from different travel companies) - While related, the passage *specifically* emphasizes *comparing* the prices found.
* **B: alhjz mbashrh m3 shrkh altyran** (booking directly with the airline) - The passage advises *against* doing this without prior price comparison.
* **D: tfqd mwq'e shrkh altyran** (checking the airline's website) - This is *part* of the price comparison process, but not the main action the passage suggests.  The passage mentions checking airline websites *after* searching and comparing.

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states that it's *rare* for a traveler to book a flight directly without *first searching for and comparing prices*. It also mentions that prices can vary significantly between different sources.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: tfqd mwq'e shrkh altyran (Visiting the airline's website):** While the passage suggests *checking* the airline's website *after* searching, it doesn't say it's the first step.
* **C: alhjz mbashrh mn khlal shrkh altyran (Booking directly through the airline):** The passage advises *against* doing this without comparing prices first.
* **D: alhjz mbashrh m3 wkyl alsfr (Booking directly with a travel agent):** The passage doesn’t mention travel agents; it focuses on independent searching and comparison.

The passage specifically states: ""Kana assabil al wa7id lil 7usul 3alayha bishaklin asra3 huwa ersaluha ka amti3aten tamma fat7uha (The only way to get them faster was to send them as opened baggage).""  And further clarifies, ""Lan tasma7 al andhimat sharikat attayaran bi irsal al amti3a min ghaer rakeb (Airlines won't allow sending baggage without a passenger).""

This directly links the need for a companion (mrafq - someone accompanying the shipment) to sending items as baggage, requiring someone to travel *with* it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 3ndma tursl alashya' 3n tryq alshhn aljwy (When you send items by air freight):**  While air freight *can* be slow, it doesn't automatically require a companion. The passage highlights the *problem* with slow air freight, and the *solution* of sending as baggage.
* **B: 3ndma tstkhdm alshrkh ta'eratha alkhash (When you use the company's private fleet):** The passage states large companies *have* their own fleets, but the problem exists for other routes and smaller companies.
* **D: 3ndma ytm alt3aml m3 altslym mn qbl shrkh akbr (When dealing with delivery by larger companies):** The passage doesn't say larger companies *require* a companion, just that they have better resources.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the benefits offered by airlines within the same alliance *vary* and that loyalty program points accumulation can be *more difficult* with different airlines *within the same alliance*.  This means simply choosing the airline with the most points (A) or the largest alliance (B) isn't necessarily the best strategy.  While flying with the airline you most often use (C) seems logical, the passage emphasizes the importance of considering *what* those airlines offer in terms of benefits.  Therefore, prioritizing airlines that *may* offer extra perks (D) is the most sensible approach based on the information provided.

This translates to ""...frequent flyer points may be stricter with different airlines *within the same alliance*.""  The passage then implies that to get the *best* points, you need to consider airlines in *different* alliances.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: shrkh alkhtwt aljwyh almntzmh tht nfs althalf walty tsafr m3ha akthr** (Regular airlines that the same alliance and you fly with more) - The passage specifically says points can be *stricter* within the same alliance.

The passage (P) explicitly states: ""Ishrab al-mashrubat al-ku7uliya bi-i3tidal"" which translates to ""Drink alcoholic beverages in moderation."" It then goes on to explain the dangers of *overconsumption* and the risks associated with illegally produced alcohol.  Therefore, moderation is presented as a way to mitigate the harmful effects.

(and its facilities occupy the highest export values among other countries). This directly links the high value to the *munsha2atuhu* (facilities/properties) within the *Mintaqat al Qanat* (canal district).
* **The passage identifies the *Mintaqat al Qanat* as the area with unique culture and historical value.**  This area *is* the canals (Grachtengordel in Dutch).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage *states* it's a UNESCO World Heritage site, but doesn't ask *where* it's designated.
* **C:**  The passage says the area surrounds the *center* of Amsterdam, not that it was removed from the center.

The text states: ""...wa tatallab liyaqa badaniyya..."" which translates to ""...and requires physical fitness...""  It also states that a visit is not possible except during the summer months (October to February).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **C: jdwl 'eml ysmh balsfr fi dysmbr wynayr (work schedule allowing travel in December and January):** The text specifies the season for travel (Oct-Feb) but doesn’t state a schedule *prevents* travel within that season.

It then describes these beaches as family-friendly and safe for swimming.

* **C: mantiqat North Harbour:** The text describes North Harbour beaches as facing the Pacific Ocean and doesn't emphasize them as particularly calm.

(All beaches are almost sandy and safe for swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.)  It specifically mentions Devonport as the southern end of the North Harbour beaches, which are described as safe for swimming.

While the text says swimming is safe in all mentioned areas, Devonport is explicitly identified as part of the safe, sandy beaches. The other options are broader areas:

The text explicitly states: ""La tushawwih al mawaqi3 min khilal wade3 3alamat aw al kitaba 3ala al judran fil hayakil."" This translates to ""Do not deface the sites by placing marks or writing on the walls of the structures.""  Scratching buildings falls under defacing the site.

Let's look at why the other options are less directly prohibited:

*   **A: altsrf bwqar (behavior with noise)** - While disrespectful behavior isn't *encouraged* by mentioning karam wa tawqir (generosity and respect), it isn't explicitly forbidden in the listed rules.
*   **B: trk 3lamh fi mkan ma 7wl almwq'e (leaving flags somewhere around the site)** - The text doesn’t specifically address flags.
*   **C: elqa' ald'eabat (throwing garbage)** -  The emphasis on karam wa tawqir (generosity and respect) would likely discourage littering, but it isn't a direct prohibition.

The passage is very clear about not altering or damaging the physical structures of the memorial site, making ""scratching buildings"" the most inappropriate action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: مستنَّع (Mustan'ah - Borrowed/Utilized):**  While auxiliary languages *utilize* elements from other languages, they aren't simply borrowed. They are *created*.
* **B: غير طبيعية (Ghayr Tabee'iyyah - Unnatural):**  The passage contrasts auxiliary languages with *natural* languages (lughat tabi3iyya), implying they are *not* natural, but ""constructed"" is a more precise description of *how* they aren't natural.
* **D: مكتسبة (Muktasabah - Acquired):** Languages are acquired, but this doesn't define what an auxiliary language *is*.  It describes how one learns it.



Therefore, **C (Mabniyyah - Constructed)** is the most accurate description of an auxiliary language based on the provided text."

(Auxiliary languages are constructed or built languages specifically created to facilitate communication between peoples who may face difficulties communicating in another way.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: enha lghat tby'eyh wmbnyh (It is a natural and constructed language)** - The passage specifically differentiates auxiliary languages *from* natural languages.
* **C: enha lghat mbnyh lthsyn synarywhat alatsal als'ebh (It is a constructed language to improve difficult communication scenarios)** - While true it doesn't fully capture the *purpose* as stated in the passage.
* **D: tnsha klghat mhymnh byn almt7dthyn blghat mkhtlfh (It creates a common language between speakers of different languages)** -  This is a *result* of using an auxiliary language, but not its defining characteristic.

The passage (P) states: ""yu3fa rukkab arra7alat al-ba7riya min shurut atta2shira (raji3 ashurut)."" This translates to ""Passengers on sea voyages are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).""  Therefore, the question asking what passengers need if their sea voyage is in winter directly relates to the conditions/requirements for a permit (or exemption from visa requirements).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **C: alshrwt (the conditions):** While the passage refers to ""conditions,"" the question asks *what* the passengers need, not just that conditions exist. The permit/exemption *is* the requirement, the conditions detail *how* to get it.
*   **D: mqdar alwqt aldy syuqda fi almdynh (the amount of time spent in the city):** The passage says voyages in Saint Petersburg spend *some* time in the city, but it doesn’t state this as a requirement.

* **The question (Q) asks:** what can passengers avoid if the sea voyage is in winter?

Therefore, avoiding crossing the ice aligns directly with the information provided in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: alwqt fi almdynh** (time in the city) - The passage mentions time in the city, but doesn't suggest it needs to be *avoided*.
* **C: mttlbat alhswl 3la tashyrh dkhwl** (requirements for obtaining an entry permit) - The passage mentions permit requirements, but doesn't frame it as something to avoid; it's just a condition.

It is being used more for official signage because of its legal standing and wider understanding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

This directly relates to unique, antique furnishings.
* **The passage highlights the focus on basic elements elevated to an art form:** The passage states lodging and meals ""breathe"" based on beds and meals.  Luxury and attention to detail in those core areas are key.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: بنود قائمة تعام متخخصة (Specialized deal items):** While good service is implied, the passage doesn't focus on specific deals or promotions.
* **C: مساحات خارجية جيدة التصميم (Well-designed outdoor spaces):** The passage mentions gardens (""misa7at khadhra2 mushadhabba""), but it's presented as *one* element of a historical building, not the primary focus of luxury.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ay mma yly ststdyfh bkyn fi 3am 2022?","The correct answer is **B: ahdath aljlyd alty tjry fi aldakhl** (indoor ice events).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Satastadhif Beijing 7aflatay al-iftita7 wal khitam wa tadhahurat al-jalid addakhiliya.""  This translates to ""Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies and **indoor ice events**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: dwrh alal'eab alawlmbyh alsyfyh** (the summer Olympic games role) - The passage highlights Beijing being the *first* city to host both, not just a role in the summer games.
* **C: dwrh alal'eab alawlmbyh alshtwyh** (the winter Olympic games role) - While Beijing *is* hosting the winter games, the question asks specifically what it will *host*, and the passage details specific events.
* **D: mrasm alakhttam** (the closing ceremony) - It hosts the closing ceremony *and* opening, and the passage details more than just the ceremonies.



"
mn hw alakthr 'erdh llesabh benflwnza altywr?,"The correct answer is **A: مراقبي الطيور (mraqby altywr - bird watchers)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ولكن هنالك بعض المخاطر على مراقبي الطيور (but there are also some risks to bird watchers).""  This directly links bird watchers to being at risk from avian influenza.

The passage mentions those working with poultry and livestock *also* being affected, but highlights the *specific* risk to bird watchers.

Therefore, bird watchers are the most likely to be infected with avian influenza based on the provided text.



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ay mn al'ebarat altalyh tsf bdqh enflwnza altywr?","The correct answer is **A: fqt 'emal aldwajn asybwa balenflwnza** (Workers with poultry are the main cause of bird flu).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Laqad tadamman mu3dham al-ashkhas al-3amilina fi tarbiyat addawajin..."" (Most of the people involved were working in poultry farming...). This directly links poultry workers to the cases.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: tm aleblagh 3n halat fi albshr akthr mn altywr** (More cases were reported in humans than in birds): The passage states the opposite - reports are *fewer* in humans (""Tamma al-iblagh 3an aqal min alef 7ala bayna al-bashar"").
* **C: mraqbw altywr m3rdwn lkhtr alesabh** (Bird watchers are exposed to risk of infection): The passage mentions some concerns for bird watchers, but it doesn't state they are *primarily* affected.
* **D: jmy'e alhalat almblgh 3nha fi albshr kant qatlh** (All reported cases in humans were fatal): The passage states *some* were fatal (""wa lakin b3dhaha kana qatilan""), not all.



"
mada trbt qnah albhr alabyd - bhr albltyq?,"The correct answer is **C: almhyt almtjmd alshmaly wbhr albltyq** (The Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea).

The text specifically states: ""Tartabitu qanat al ba7er al Abyad wal Baltiq bayna al mu7it al mutajammid ashamali wa ba7er al baltiq..."" which translates to ""The White Sea-Baltic canal connects between the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: albhr alaswd wbhr qzwyn** (The Black Sea and the Caspian Sea) - While the text mentions Vikings using routes *to* these seas, it doesn't state they are connected to the White Sea-Baltic canal.
*   **B: bhyrh awnygha wnhr alfwlgha** (Lake Onega and the Volga River) - These are *parts* of the route, but don't define the overall connection the canal makes.
*   **D: almhyt aljnwby walbhr alahmr** (The Southern Ocean and the Red Sea) - These are completely unrelated to the described waterway.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma nw'e al3arbeh alty ymkn jm3 jwazat alsfr fyha hta la ynqt'e nwm alrakb?","The correct answer is **B: qitarat alnwm allylh (night sleeper trains)**.

The passage specifically states: ""Fi qitarat annawm allayliya, yumkin lil-mu7assil istilam jawazat assafar 7atta la taqta3a nawmak."" (In night sleeper trains, the conductor can collect passports so as not to interrupt your sleep).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ta'erat (airplane):** The passage mentions airplanes as a point of entry, but doesn't say passports are collected *during* the flight to allow passengers to sleep.
* **C: sfn (ship):** Similar to airplanes, ships are mentioned as entry points, but not as places where passports are collected for sleep.
* **D: qitarat 'eabrh llhdwd (border crossing trains):** The passage mentions inspections *on* these trains, and needing ID when boarding, but not passport collection for sleep.



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, mta ymkn fhs btaqh hwytk fi b3d alqtarat 'ebr alhdwd?","The correct answer is **D: fi alqitar alsa'er** (on the moving train).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Fi ba3dh al-qitarat al-3abira lil-7udud, tujra 3amaliyat attaftish fil qitar al-muta7arrik wa yajib 2an yakun ladayka huwiya sali7a 3inda rukub a7ad hadhih al-qitarat.""  This translates to: ""In some large border trains, inspection is carried out on the moving train and you must have valid identification when boarding one of these trains.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: b3d alnzwl mn alqitar** (after disembarking the train) - The passage states inspection points are *usually* the first stop *upon arrival*, not after leaving.
* **B: athna' nwmk** (during your sleep) - While passports might be collected during sleep on overnight trains, the passage refers to needing identification *when boarding* certain trains for inspection.
* **C: la ytm fhsha** (it is not checked) - The passage directly states it *is* checked on certain trains.

ma hy almshklat altalyh alty mn almhtml an tzhr fi alghalb athna' albqa' fi almntqh alastwa'eyh al'ealyh fi Sangafora?,"The correct answer is **C: alm3anah mn alerhaq al7rary (exhaustion from the heat)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""...when you enter the """"high equatorial regions"""" a few degrees north of the equator, you will need to cope with the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, and rarely is it not).""

This directly points to the difficulty of dealing with intense heat as the primary problem in the high equatorial regions of Sangafora.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: alt'erd llsrqh (the theft of food):** The passage doesn't mention theft. It focuses on the *need* to eat and cope with the climate.
* **B: edm emkanyh alwswl ela almtajr (impossibility of accessing shops):**  The passage states you can ""buy almost anything"" after arrival, implying access to shops *is* possible.
* **D: aldya'e (dizziness):** While heat can *cause* dizziness, the passage directly addresses the problem of heat itself as the challenge.  Dizziness is a symptom, not the core issue described.



"
mn qd yrghb fi tjnb tnawl alm3jnat alalmanyh?,"The correct answer is **A: shkhs y'eany mn hsasyh shdydh mn aljwz (A person suffering from a severe nut allergy)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ta7tawy al3adid min al-makhbuzat al-almaniya aydhan 3ala allawz wal bunduq wa ghayriha min al-mukassarat al-2ukhra."" (Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.)

Someone with a severe nut allergy would absolutely need to avoid German pastries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: shkhs yfdl alhlwyat alakthr ghna (A person who prefers sweeter sweets):** The passage describes the pastries as rich (""ghaniya""), so someone who likes rich sweets would likely *enjoy* them.
* **C: shkhs la yhb alshwkwla (A person who doesn't like chocolate):** The passage doesn't mention chocolate.  The pastries are described as containing fruit and nuts.
* **D: shkhs yfdl alnkhat alhlwh 3la alnkhat alghnyh (A person who prefers sweet flavors over rich flavors):**  The passage emphasizes the richness of the pastries; someone preferring sweetness might not find them ideal, but it's not a *need* to avoid them like an allergy.



"
ma hw almkwn aldy y'etbr 3nsraan mwsmyaan fi alm3jnat alalmanyh?,"The correct answer is **C: alkhwkh (cherries/peaches)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...يظهر الكرز والخوخ خلال فصل الصيف"" which translates to ""...cherries and peaches appear during the summer.""  This directly identifies them as seasonal ingredients in German pastries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: altfah (the dough)** - While dough is essential, it's not a *seasonal* ingredient.
* **B: albndq (hazelnuts)** - The text mentions hazelnuts *are* used, but doesn't highlight them as specifically seasonal.
* **D: allwz (almonds)** - Similar to hazelnuts, almonds are used, but not emphasized as a seasonal component.

"bna'an 3la alfa8arh, ayun mn altaly ln ykwn nsyhh mwsa bha llsfr bmyzanyh mhdwdh?","The correct answer is **D: khfd alnfqat mthl alt3am walskn (reduce expenses like food and accommodation)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on reducing expenses as a way to travel on a budget.** It specifically states ""turakkiz hadhihi al-maqala 3ala hadha al-akhir"" (this article focuses on the latter), referring to ""mu7awalat al-7ad min nafaqatik"" (trying to reduce your expenses).  It talks about ways to travel affordably by minimizing costs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: albhth 3n wza'ef ghrybh llqyam bha athna' rhlatk (looking for strange jobs to do during your trip)** - The passage doesn't mention finding odd jobs. It focuses on *reducing* spending, not *earning* while traveling.
* **B: kn mrnaan m3 mstwa rahtk (be flexible with your comfort level)** - While flexibility is helpful for budget travel, the passage doesn't directly advise this.
* **C: atlb almal mn alnas (ask people for money)** - The passage *explicitly prohibits* begging (""aw attasawwul"") as a means to fund travel.  It stresses ethical behavior.



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, mn qd ywajh s'ewbh fi alsfr bmyzanyh d'eylh jdaan?","The correct answer is **C: shkhs ma ykhtt ll'eml 3n b3d athna' alsfr** (a person who doesn't plan to work remotely during travel).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Li 2ula2ika alladhyn yarghabun fi attadh7iya bi-rra7a wal waqt wal qudra 3ala attanabu2 li-khafdh annafaqat bil qurb min assifr, raji3 al-7ad al-2adna li-mizaniyat assafar."" (For those who want to travel comfortably, with time, and the ability to reduce expenses close to travel, refer to the recent travel budget).

This implies the advice is *for those who are NOT working while traveling*.  If someone *is* planning to work remotely (and earn money) during travel, they wouldn't need the advice on drastically reducing expenses – they'd have income to offset costs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: shkhs yrhb balthdy** (a person who loves luxury) - The passage focuses on *reducing* expenses, not enjoying luxury.
*   **B: shkhs bdwn qywd zmnyh sarmh** (a person with no time constraints) - While having time flexibility might help, it isn't the core focus of who would benefit from this budget-focused advice.
*   **D: shkhs ystmt'e batba'e msar alrhlh** (a person who enjoys following the travel route) - Enjoying the route doesn't relate to the need for a tight budget.



"
ay mn altsryhat altalyh la tsf bdqh alqyadh byn Point Marion wa Fairmont?,"The correct answer is **A: hnak msahat twylh mn altrq alryfyh alna'eyh** (There are long stretches of remote rural roads).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Yumathil attariq al-mumtad bayna Point Marion wa Fairmont akthar dhuruf al-qiyada ta7addiyan...7aythu yamur 3iddat marrat 3abra tadharis ghabat ma3zula."" (The route between Point Marion and Fairmont presents more challenging driving conditions...where it crosses several isolated forest hills.)  This directly describes long stretches of remote rural roads.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: almmrat dyqh (Narrow passages):** While the passage mentions ""mun7anayat adhayiqa"" (narrow passes), it doesn't characterize the *entire* drive as being about narrow passages.
* **C: nadraan ma ytm alaltzam bhdwd alsr3eh (Speed limits are rarely adhered to):** The passage emphasizes the *importance* of adhering to the speed limit, not that it's rarely followed.
* **D: la ynbghy an tkwn khdmh alhatf almhmwl mshklh (Cell service shouldn't be a problem):** The passage actually states the *opposite* - cell service is *surprisingly good* on this route.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ay mn h3la' yjb an ykwn msdr qlq r'eysy llsa'eqyn aldyn ysafrwn 3la tryq bwfalw - bytsbrgh alsry'e?","The correct answer is **D: مواجهة أعمال الطرق المتكررة (Facing repeated road work)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the route between Point Marion and Fairmont is more challenging due to ""numerous crossings over isolated forest hills,"" ""sharp curves, passages, and narrow declines."" It emphasizes slowing down to 35-40 mph and maintaining focus. This describes difficult road conditions and the need to navigate challenging terrain - essentially, repeated road work/difficulties caused by the natural landscape.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: الوقوع في حركة المرور الكثيفة (Getting stuck in heavy traffic):** The passage doesn’t mention traffic congestion.
*   **B: نقص خدمة الهاتف الخلوي الكافية (Lack of sufficient cell phone service):** The passage *contrasts* this, saying cell service is *better* on this route.
*   **C: أخذ منعطفات حادة بكبر (Taking sharp turns at high speed):** The passage specifically warns *against* this and stresses slowing down.

ay mma yly ghyr mtlwb lbd' altjdyf?,"The passage states canyoneering (tasalluq ashallalat) requires ""al-qalil nisbiyan min attadrib aw ashakl al-badani lil-bad2"" - *relatively little* training or physical shape compared to other sports.

The question asks what is **NOT** required for canyoneering.

Let's break down the options:

* **A: alqdrh 3la alsbahh (ability to swim)** - The passage explicitly mentions canyoneering combines elements of *swimming* (as-siba7a). So this *is* required.
* **B: halh bdnyh 'ealyh (high physical fitness)** - The passage states it requires *relatively little* physical fitness. So this is *not* a primary requirement.
* **C: qdrh alqfz (ability to jump)** - The passage states canyoneering includes *jumping* (al-qafz). So this *is* required.
* **D: qdr d'eyl mn altdryb (some amount of training)** - The passage states it requires *relatively little* training. So this *is* required, even if not a lot.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: halh bdnyh 'ealyh (high physical fitness)**.  Canyoneering is accessible to people with varying levels of fitness, compared to other demanding sports.



"
ay mma yly qd ykwn drwryaan lrhlh tjdyf najhh?,"The correct answer is **D: qdrh alsbahh (ability to swim)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states that canyoneering (tasalluq ashallalat) combines elements of swimming, climbing, and jumping.** This directly implies a strong swimming ability is *necessary*.
* The passage also notes it requires ""a little relatively"" training or physical shape, *compared to* more demanding sports. This means it's not necessarily about advanced athleticism (A), or specific experience like diving (B) or formal certifications (C).  Swimming is the fundamental skill needed.

Therefore, the most crucial thing for a successful canyoneering trip, according to the text, is the ability to swim.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma aldy sykwn mfydaan lshkhs ykhtt lltkhyym fi syarth?","The correct answer is **B: syarh tsmh llmqa'ed balastlqa'** (a car that allows the seats to recline).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Yumkinu attakhyim fi assayara idha kana ladayk minivan kabir aw sayarat daf3 ruba3y aw sedan aw Station Wagon bi-maqa3id ta2khudh wadh3 al-istilqa2.""  (You can camp in the car if you have a large minivan or a four-wheel drive car or a sedan or Station Wagon with seats that can take a reclining position).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: fhm qwy lqywd syartk** (strong understanding of your car's limitations) - While understanding your car is mentioned as a benefit of using it for a road trip, it's not specifically what's *needed* for camping *in* the car.
* **C: khymh** (a tent) - The passage actually contrasts camping *in* a car with setting up a tent, implying a tent isn't necessary for this method.
* **D: mlkyh khash lltkhyym fyha** (private property for camping on) - The passage warns that camping *outside* the car (like setting up a tent) on private or public land can attract unwanted attention.



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma aldy qd yrghb mkhym fi alsyarh fi tjnbh eda kan yttl'e ela tjnb lft alantbah?","The correct answer is **C: nsb khymh fi almdynh aw fi mlkyh khash (setting up a tent in a city or on private property)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yumkinu 2an yu2ady insha2 khayma fi milkiya khassa aw fi madina min ayi 7ajm ila jadhb al-intibah ghayr al-marghub fihi bi-suhula.""  This translates to: ""You can easily attract unwanted attention by setting up a tent on private property or in a city of any size.""

The question asks what someone *might* want to avoid when camping in a vehicle to avoid unwanted attention. Setting up a tent outside the vehicle (in a city or on private land) is the action the passage identifies as attracting that attention.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: qyadh syarh akbr, mthl syarh df'e rba'ey aw shahnh sghyrh (driving a larger vehicle, like a four-wheel drive or small truck):** The passage doesn't say larger vehicles attract attention. It actually suggests they're *less* likely to.
* **B: alqyam brhlh atwl 3la altryq (taking a longer trip on the road):**  The length of the trip isn't relevant to attracting unwanted attention.
* **D: alaftqar ela alelmam balmrkbh alty ystkhdmha (lacking knowledge of the vehicle you are using):**  Knowing your vehicle is a positive thing, not a cause of unwanted attention.



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, mn a'ead bna' aldar albyda' llmrh althanyh?","The correct answer is **D: sltan almghrb** (the Moroccan Sultan).

Here's why:

The text states: ""A3ada assultan al-maghribi bina2 al-madina bi ism Daru l-Badya..."" which translates to ""The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya..."".  This directly answers the question of who rebuilt Casablanca for the second time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: albrtghalywn** (the Portuguese) - They *destroyed* and initially rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but it was abandoned after the 1755 earthquake.
*   **B: tjar esban** (Spanish traders) - They established trading posts and gave it the name Casablanca, but they didn't rebuild the city.
*   **C: almrynyd** (the Marinids) - They used it as a strategic port (Anfa) but didn't rebuild it in the second instance mentioned in the question.



"
mn hjr mdynh aldar albyda' alhdythh b3d karthh tby'eyh?,"The correct answer is **B: albrtghalywn (the Portuguese)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dammaraha al-burtughaliyun wa a3adu bina2aha ta7ta ism Casa Branca, faqat li-tarkiha ba3da zilzal sanat 1755.""  This translates to: ""The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.""

Therefore, the Portuguese were the ones who rebuilt the city after its destruction.



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, kyf hslt Sintra 3la ala'etraf byn alajanb?","The correct answer is **C: mraj'eat allwrd bayrwn aleyjabyh** (Lord Byron's positive reviews).

Here's why:

The text states: ""ushtuhirat bil ajaneb ba3da tasjil 7isab 3an madhiriha alkhallaba min qibal Lord Byron"" - which translates to ""became famous among foreigners after Lord Byron recorded an account of its captivating views."" 

Therefore, Sintra gained recognition among foreigners *because of* Lord Byron's praise.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cabo da Roca:** This is a place the bus stops at *near* Sintra, not the reason for Sintra's fame.
*   **B: alzhwrat almrymyh (the Marian apparitions):** This relates to Fatima, a different location mentioned in the text.
*   **D: tarykhha alrwmansy (its romantic history):** While Sintra *is* romantic, the text specifically attributes its foreign fame to Byron.



"
ma aldy la t'etrf bh Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: aljmhwryh aljdydh (the new republic)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ella annahu la yujad dawla qa2ima wa la 7atta Arminya ta3tarifu biha rasmiyyan"" which translates to ""However, there is no functioning state and even Armenia does not officially recognize it.""  ""It"" refers to the new republic formed in Nagorno-Karabakh.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: mntqh Nagorno-Karabakh (Nagorno-Karabakh region)** - Armenia doesn't not recognize the *region* itself, but the *republic* declared within it.
*   **B: alhrb dd aladrbyjanyyn (the war against Azerbaijan)** - The war is a past event, not something Armenia doesn't recognize.
*   **C: alhjj adrbyjan aldblwmasyh (Azerbaijani diplomacy)** - This is related to the issue, but not what Armenia is refusing to recognize.



"
ma aldy la yzal y'ethr 3la al3laqat byn Azerbaijan wa Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: eqlym Nagorno-Karabakh (Nagorno-Karabakh region)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Yuwasil aljadal al diBlomasi 7awla al mintaqa fi ifsad al3alaqa bayna Armenia wa Azerbaijan"" - which translates to ""The diplomatic dispute over the region continues to spoil relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.""  The ""region"" being referred to is Nagorno-Karabakh.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: alarmn aldyn y'eyshwn fi Azerbaijan (the Armenians who live in Azerbaijan):** While Armenians living in Azerbaijan are a factor, the text highlights the *dispute over the territory* as the primary issue.
*   **B: 7rb 1994 (the 1994 war):** The war *caused* the current situation, but the ongoing *dispute* over Nagorno-Karabakh is what *continues* to affect relations.
*   **C: alhjj aldblwmasyh (the diplomatic disputes):** This is a description of the effect, not the cause. The dispute *is* happening *because of* Nagorno-Karabakh.

"athna' rkwb syarh ajrh fi Charlotte, ma aldy ymkn an y'edy ela rswm edafyh?","The correct answer is **B: wjwd thlathh rkab (the presence of three riders)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hunaka taklifa idafiyya li wujud akthar min rakibayn, lidha qad yakun hadha al khayar aghla min al-lazem.""  This translates to: ""There is an additional cost for having more than two riders, therefore this option may be more expensive than necessary.""

This directly relates to extra fees when using ride-sharing services (like Uber/Lyft) in Charlotte.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: aleqamh fi mntqh akhra (living in another region):**  The passage discusses why people *move to* Charlotte, not costs associated with living elsewhere.
*   **C: aldhab ela abtawn (going downtown):** While going downtown might have surge pricing at times, the passage specifically mentions extra *rider* costs.
*   **D: an tkwn sdyqaan ll'ea'elh (being a driver for a family):** This is not mentioned in the text.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that while taxis/rideshares *can* be useful, they are often **more expensive** for families due to extra rider fees. This is presented as a potential downside to getting around Charlotte.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: أسعار السكن (As'aar al-sakan - Housing costs):** The passage doesn't mention anything about housing costs being a negative.
*   **C: المقيمين من منطقة أخرى (Al-muqimeen min mintaqah ukhra - Residents from another area):** The passage states people *move to* Charlotte *from* other areas specifically *because* of its family-friendly environment, so this isn't a downside.
*   **D: محاولة الاستمتاع بالمدينة (Muhawalat al-istimtaa' bilmadinah - Trying to enjoy the city):** The passage says visitors find the city enjoyable *with* children.

"qbl wswl alesban, mn kan ysytr 3la aljz' alshmaly mn tshyly?","The correct answer is **D: alenka** (the Incas).

Here's why:

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mapuche:** The text says the Mapuche inhabited the *central and southern* parts of Chile, not the north.
*   **B: alamyrkywn (Americans):** This is too general and doesn't refer to a specific ruling group.
*   **C: skan arwkanya (Araucanian people):** This is another name for the Mapuche, and as stated before, they ruled the central/southern areas.



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ay mma yly lm y7dth fi 3am 1810?","The correct answer is **B: hqqt tshyly alnsr 3la alesban** (Chile achieved victory over the Spanish).

Here's why:

The text states: ""على الرغم من إعلان تشيلي استقلالها في عام 1810 (وسط حروب نابليون التي تركت إسبانيا بدون حكومة مركزية عاملة لمدة عامين)، إلا أن النصر الحاسم على الإسبان لم يتحقق حتى عام 1818.""

This translates to: ""Despite Chile declaring its independence in 1810 (amidst the Napoleonic Wars which left Spain without a working central government for two years), a decisive victory over the Spanish was not achieved until 1818.""

Therefore, Chile *did not* achieve victory over the Spanish in 1810. They *declared* independence, but the victory came later.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: kan hnak ghyab llhkwmh almrkzyh** (there was a lack of central government) - The text explicitly states this *did* happen in 1810 due to the Napoleonic Wars.
*   **C: kant alhrwb alnablywnyh jaryh** (the Napoleonic Wars were ongoing) - The text also confirms this happened in 1810.
*   **D: a'elnt tshyly astqlalha** (Chile declared its independence) -  The text explicitly states Chile declared independence in 1810.



"

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Wa tarbut al qitarat wal qawareb al quran, wa la yumkin lil sayyarat al wusul ilayha min al kharej.""  This translates to ""The villages are connected by trains and boats, and cars cannot reach them from the outside.""

Therefore, the only ways to access the remote villages in Liguria are by train or boat.



"
"""ma aldy yshyr elyh almstlh aleytaly """"Cinque Terre""""?""","The correct answer is **A: khms qra** (five villages).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Cinque Terre, al lati ta3ni khams aradi, tadumu khams qura sa7iliyya saghira..."" which translates to ""Cinque Terre, which means five lands, consists of five small coastal villages..."" 

Therefore, ""Cinque Terre"" refers to five villages.

The text specifically states: ""Yajib an yakun annamat 3amiq bi darajatin kafiya 5 mm (1/5 inchan) aw akthr..."" which translates to ""The tread should be deep enough, 5 mm (1/5 inch) or more..."" This directly supports the option describing shoes with a sole depth of 1/5 inch.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: hda' bk'eb dyq** (shoes with a narrow heel) - The text states the heel should be *wide* (""munkhafidan wa wasi3an"").
*   **B: ahdyh bm3dat mrs'eh** (shoes with studded soles) - While the text mentions some shoes *have* studs, it doesn't say this is the *best* type.
*   **C: hda' bk'eb 'ealen** (shoes with a high heel) - The text states the heel should be *low* (""munkhafidan"").

ayun mn altaly ln ysa'ed fi thsyn aljr 3la altrq aljlydyh athna' zrwf alshta'?,"The correct answer is **D: alma' (water)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ghaliban ma yatanathar arraml aw al 7asa aw al mil7 (chloride alcalcium) 3ala alturuq aw almasarat li ta7sin al i7tikak.""  This translates to: ""Sand, gravel, or salt (calcium chloride) are often spread on roads and paths to *improve* friction.""

Water (alma') does the *opposite* - it makes surfaces slippery and *reduces* friction. Therefore, water would not help with grip on icy roads.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: almlh (salt):** The passage specifically mentions salt (mil7/calcium chloride) *improving* friction.
*   **B: alhsa (gravel):**  The passage specifically mentions gravel (7asa) *improving* friction.
*   **C: alrml (sand):** The passage specifically mentions sand (raml) *improving* friction.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Li-tamayuziha bi-nnitaq azzamany nafsahu li-Hawaii..."" which translates to ""Due to its sharing the same time zone as Hawaii..."". 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: klahma ldyh al'edyd mn alfnadq alkbyrh** (They both have many large hotels) - The text explicitly states Cook Islands *lack* large hotels, comparing them to Hawaii *before* its development.
* **B: klahma lys lhma wd'e wlayh** (They both have no valleys and plains) - The text doesn't mention valleys or plains.
* **D: klahma lys fyh ay mdn** (They both have no cities) - The text states Cook Islands have no cities, but doesn't say anything about Hawaii having or not having them.



"
ay mma yly la ysf bdqh jzr Cook?,"The correct answer is **A: enha asghr mn Hawaii** (that it is smaller than Hawaii).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""3ala arraghm min kawniha asghar 7ajman..."" which translates to ""Despite being smaller in size...""  This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: enha arkhbyl** (that it is an archipelago) - The passage *does* say it's an archipelago (""arkhabil yadhum 15 jazira""), but the question asks what doesn't describe Cook Islands.  Being an archipelago *is* a description.
* **C: almdyntan alr'eysytan huma Rarotonga wa Aitutaki** (the two main cities are Rarotonga and Aitutaki) - The passage states these are the *most important islands*, not cities. It also explicitly says Cook Islands has *no cities* (""La tadhumu juzur Cook ay mudun"").
* **D: tshark aldwlh aljzyrh almntqh alzmnyh m3 Hawaii** (the state shares the time zone with Hawaii) - The passage states it has the *same time zone* as Hawaii (""Li-tamayuziha bi-nnitaq azzamany nafsahu li-Hawaii""), making this a correct description, not something it *doesn't* do.



"

The text states: ""Tu3addu Sirena m7attat al7irasa al-wa7ida allaty tuqaddimu assakan fi salat nawm mushtaraka **wa wajabat sakhina** bil-2idhafa ila attakhyim."" This translates to: ""Sirena is the only guard station that offers accommodation in shared dormitories **and hot meals** in addition to camping.""

This indicates Sirena provides both accommodation *and* meals (a type of food choice), while the other stations only offer camping. Therefore, Sirena is the only station offering two types of choices (accommodation & meals).

The text states: ""Tuqaddimu CafeNet El Sol khidmat 7ajz muqabil rusum qadruha 30 dolar amriki, aw 10 dolarat amrikiya li yawmin wa7id..."" (CafeNet El Sol offers a booking service for a fee of 30 US dollars, or 10 US dollars for a single day...).  This directly indicates they take cash (US dollars) for booking permits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sirena:** Sirena only offers accommodation *with* permits, it doesn't sell permits themselves.
*   **B: Puerto Jiménez:** They accept direct bookings, but *don't* accept credit cards, meaning they don't necessarily accept cash either, the text doesn’t specify.
*   **D: La Leona:** Only offers camping, no food services or permit booking.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma nw'e altzlj aldy ytm fi altdarys alakthr anhdaraan?","The correct answer is **D: altzlj bhqybh alzhr** (skiing with a heavy backpack).

Here's why:

The text states that *real* skiing (the kind with steeper slopes and needing more robust gear) is *not* typically associated with ""jawlat tazzalluj"" (snowshoeing/cross-country skiing). It then draws a comparison to long-distance walking, implying that snowshoeing is less intense. However, it *does* mention that real skiing happens on very steep slopes and requires more gear.  The phrase ""7aqibat dhahr thaqila fi masarat mu3adda"" (a heavy backpack on prepared trails) directly implies the kind of skiing done *without* the features of snowshoeing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: almshy lmsafat twylh 3la altzlj** (long-distance walking on skis) - This describes snowshoeing/cross-country skiing, *not* the type of skiing mentioned as happening on steep slopes.
*   **B: altzlj fi almnatq ghyr almahwlh** (skiing in unmaintained areas) - The text doesn't specifically discuss skiing in unmaintained areas.
*   **C: altzlj 3la jbal alalb** (skiing on the Alps) - While the Alps are mentioned as an example of where *mountaineering* happens, the passage differentiates that from snowshoeing.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...wa tatatallab zallajat wa **a7dhiya akthar salaba**."" (and requires skis and **more robust boots**).  It contrasts this with regular *tazalluj* which doesn't need such strong boots. The passage implies that stronger boots are needed to achieve higher speeds in more challenging terrain (like mountain climbing).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 7aqibat dhahr thaqila (heavy backpack):** The text specifically mentions *not* having a heavy backpack is a benefit of *tazalluj* compared to long-distance walking.
* **C: adhuruf al-jayida (good conditions):**  Good conditions are helpful for distance, but don't *directly* help achieve higher speed.
* **D: masarat mu3adda (prepared slopes):** Prepared slopes are for regular *tazalluj*, not the more challenging type described where higher speeds are desired.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly discusses the difficulty travelers have *re-adjusting* to their home culture after living abroad. It states they may have adapted to the new culture and lost some customs of their homeland, and that people don't always extend the same patience and understanding upon their return that they did when the traveler first left.  This is the core of ""sadmat al-3awda"" (return shock).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: altkyf m3 thqafh mkan jdyd (adapting to a new culture)** - This is the *opposite* of the problem discussed. The passage is about the problems of *re*-adaptation.
* **B: althly balsbr waltfhm (the need for patience and understanding)** - While the passage mentions this is *lacking* from others upon the traveler's return, it's not the *problem* the traveler is experiencing. It's a lack of support *for* the problem.
* **C: alsfr llkharj (traveling abroad)** - Traveling abroad is the *cause* of the problem, not the problem itself.

This translates to: ""Sometimes travelers who have an easy time adapting to the new culture, face particular difficulties in readjusting to their original culture.""

The passage specifically highlights that those who *easily* adjust to a new culture can find the reverse culture shock particularly difficult.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: almsafrwn aldyn 'eanwa mn sdmh thqafyh sy'eh bshkl khas** (Travelers who experience a lot of culture shock) - The passage suggests the *opposite* - those who *don't* experience much culture shock initially struggle more upon return.
* **C: almsafrwn aldyn ma zalwa fi mrhlh shhr al'esl** (Travelers who are still in the honeymoon phase) - The passage specifically contrasts reverse culture shock with the honeymoon phase, stating it's *less* like that and lasts longer.
* **D: almsafrwn bsbr aql** (Travelers with less patience) - While patience is helpful, the passage doesn't focus on patience as the determining factor for reverse culture shock difficulty.  It's about the *ease* of initial adaptation.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**7awel aydan alla taqum bi 7araka ghareba bi asabe3ek**"" (Also try not to make strange movements with your fingers).  This directly translates to avoiding unnecessary movements.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage *does* mention increasing pressure on the keys for a higher sound, but it's not presented as a core, essential piece of advice.
* **C:** The passage *does* emphasize keeping your hand relaxed and capable of reaching all notes, but doesn't frame it as ""searching"" for the scales.
* **D:** The passage *does* mention using the bellows faster for more volume, but it's a technique for *volume*, not a fundamental piece of advice for successful playing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: mezyed men al8uwa** (more size) - The passage doesn't suggest size affects volume.
* **C: deghet aqel** (less pressure) - The passage suggests *more* pressure can increase volume.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: llsama7 bi tarjamat al shashah** (to allow for subtitles) - While the text mentions subtitles *being affected* by the cropping, the cropping isn't *done* for the subtitles themselves.
* **C: llsama7 bi al t7wyl albasyt ela tenseyqat akhera** (to allow for easy conversion to other formats) - The text doesn't mention format conversion as a reason for the cropping.
* **D: lqt3 tarjamat al shashah ltkown qeryebha jedaan men alejz2 alsfely** (to cut the subtitles to be very close to the bottom part) - This describes a *result* of the cropping, not the *reason* for it.

The passage explicitly states: ""وإذا كان مقطوع الفيديو يدوم ترجمة شاشة بقرب من الجزء السفلي للغيا، فإنها لن تظهر بالكامل"" which translates to ""And if the video cut persists with subtitles near the bottom of the screen, they will not appear completely."" This directly describes the problem of partially cut subtitles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sura la tmla2 kamel alshashah** (image doesn't fill the whole screen): While the passage discusses images not filling the screen (خروج عن إطار الشاشة), it's the *result* of the problem, not the specific issue faced during DVD conversion.
* **C: sura tmla2 kamel alshashah** (image fills the whole screen): This is the opposite of the problem described.
* **D: 7awaf maqtow3a** (cut edges): The passage mentions edges being cut, but primarily as a function of TVs being made for the general public. The specific issue impacting DVD conversion is the subtitle problem.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...waq3aha ra2is al Congress John Hancock wa al amin al-3am **Charles Thomson**."" This translates to ""...and was signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and the Secretary General **Charles Thomson**.""

While John Hancock *signed* the document, Charles Thomson was the secretary who officially attested to it. The question asks who signed the handwritten draft, and Thomson is specifically mentioned as doing so along with Hancock.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: John Dunlap:** He was the printer, not a signer.
*   **B: George Washington:** He *received* a copy and read it to his troops, but didn't sign the original draft.

Here's why:

The text states: ""لقد وصلت نسخا إلى لندن في 10 أغسطس"" which translates to ""Copies reached London on August 10th."" This indicates that London was one of the last places the Dunlap Broadsides were distributed to.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: New York:** While copies were read to Washington's troops in New York, it wasn't the *final* destination for distribution as stated in the text.
*   **B: matgr taba3at Dunlap (Dunlap's printing shop):** This is where the broadsides *originated*, not where they reached last.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 3ala shati2 3inda 7affat almiyah** (On the shore at the edge of the water) - While the text mentions extending a fence *towards* the shore, it doesn't say Stark's main position was *on* the shore.
*   **C: 3ala tul ashamal asharqi min shibh aljazira** (On the northeast side of the peninsula) - This is where the British opened a gap, not where Stark was positioned.
*   **D: amam assiyaj** (In front of the fence) - The text mentions a stake being placed *in front* of the fence, but it doesn't state Stark's *entire* force was positioned there. It was a specific marker.

This translates to: ""Gridley or Stark placed a stake about 100 feet (30 meters) in front of the fence and ordered no one to fire until the regulars passed it.""

This clearly indicates the fence (siyaj) was completed *before* the stake was set up, and that they waited for the British ""regulars"" to cross the line of the stake before firing. Therefore, they finalized their fence setup *before* the event of the regulars crossing the stake.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: athena2 talaba almustawtinun ll ta3zizat** (when the settlers requested reinforcements) - This happened *before* the fence was built.
* **C: khelal almad almunkhafid** (during the low tide) - The low tide facilitated expanding the fence, but it wasn't *when* they built it.
* **D: athna2 Itakhd al quwwat ll mawaqi3 al-amamiya** (while the forces took the front positions) - This describes the general situation, but doesn't pinpoint *when* the fence was finished.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

This directly translates to: ""When individuals exhibit several variations of a specific characteristic, they will be *mut3addidy alashkal* (polymorphic/multiple forms).""

* **B: alka2inat al7aya:** This simply means ""living organisms"" - too broad.

* **The question (Q) asks for:** the term for living organisms occupying a specific area.
* **""Alskan"" (السكان) directly translates to ""population""** – a group of organisms of the same species living in a particular geographic area.  This is the core concept described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: muwa7ady ashakl (مُوَحَّدُ الأَشْكال):**  Means ""monomorphic"" or ""uniform shape."" This describes a *type* of population, not the population itself.
* **C: naw3 (نوع):** Means ""species"" or ""type.""  It describes *what* makes up the population, not the population *as a whole* in a location.
* **D: mut3addidy alashkal (مُتَعَدِّدُ الأَشْكال):** Means ""polymorphic"" or ""multiple shapes."" Similar to 'muwa7ady ashakl', this is a *characteristic* of some populations, not the population itself.

The text states: ""Al-iliktrunat laha shu7nat kahraba2iya saliba"" which translates to ""Electrons have a negative electric charge."" 

Therefore, the particles orbiting the nucleus (the electrons) have a negative charge.



"

The text explicitly states: ""Tatakawwan annawat min naw3ayn mina aljusaymat - naytrunat wa prutunat."" (The nucleus consists of two types of particles - neutrons and protons.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: naytrunat wa Al-iliktrunat** (neutrons and electrons) - Electrons orbit the nucleus, they are *not* inside it.
* **C: Al-iliktrunat wa prutunat** (electrons and protons) - Again, electrons orbit, not reside *in* the nucleus.
* **D: prutunat wa naytrunat wa Al-iliktrunat** (protons, neutrons, and electrons) - Incorrect for the same reason as B and C.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** A binary number can only contain one of two values: 0 or 1.
* **Option A (1010):** Contains only 0s and 1s and has five digits.
* **Option B (12001):** Contains the number '2', which is *not* a valid binary digit.
* **Option C (10010):** Contains only 0s and 1s and has five digits.
* **Option D (110101):** Contains six digits, not five as requested by the question.

Therefore, **C** is the only option that fulfills both criteria: being a binary number and having five digits."

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: qiam (values)**: While binary numbers *have* values (0 or 1), the passage doesn't say they *are* referred to as values.
* **C: lugha astiahe7a (a receptive language)**:  Binary is *used* in computer language, but isn't the language itself.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""baynama yabda2 attullab ghaliban tajribat mudawwanatihim bi qawa3id na7wiya wa imla2iya qazira, fa inna wujud aljumhur yughayir dhalika 3umuman."" (While students often begin their blogging experience with weak grammar and spelling rules, the presence of an audience generally changes that.) This directly links blogging to *improving* writing and grammar skills.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: tanaqes fi alnaqed men alaqaran (decrease in criticism from peers):** While the passage *mentions* students strive to improve writing to avoid criticism, it doesn't present this as a primary *benefit* of blogging. It's a *motivation* for improvement, not the improvement itself.
* **C: edrak aws3 ll bi2a almu7yta bhem (broader awareness of the surrounding environment):** The passage states blogging ""yujbir attullab 3ala 2an yusbi7u akthar diraya bil 3alam min 7awlihim"" (forces students to become more aware of the world around them), but this is presented as a consequence *of* the need to be engaging, not the main benefit.
* **D: zeyadh alrghabh fi mwaselt att3allum (increased desire to continue learning):** The passage does say blogging ""tushaji3u attullab 3ala tawsi3 nitaq att3allum"" (encourages students to expand the scope of learning), but again, it’s a result *of* blogging, not its primary function as outlined in the text.

The passage states: ""Nadhran li anna attullab ghaliban ma yakunun aljumhur al-akthar intiqadan, yabda2 katib almudawwanat fi alsa3y li ta7sin alkitaba li tajannub annaqd.""  (Because students are often not the most critical audience, bloggers begin to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.)

This directly links the act of blogging to a motivation for improved writing – avoiding negative feedback.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: al2setjabh alemtekrerh ll mawad 3la al internet (repeated responses to material on the internet):** While the passage mentions responding to online material *as a result* of improved skills, it isn't the initial driver for improvement.
* **C: al7efaz 3la ahetmam jumhurhem (maintaining their audience's interest):** The passage mentions needing to *attract* audience interest, but not specifically *maintaining* it as the primary motivator for initial writing improvement.
* **D: al7ajeh li-atta3awun (the need for collaboration):** Collaboration is mentioned as a benefit of blogging, not the initial reason students try to write better.

ayun mema yely leys men fawa2ed alatesal gheyr alemtezamen li ttullab? ,"The correct answer is **B: wosol ela al-mudarrisin wajhan li wajh fi ay waqt men alywm** (access to teachers face-to-face at any time of the day).

Here's why:

The text states that asynchronous communication *replaces* waiting for face-to-face meetings. It allows students to send questions and receive reasonably quick replies *instead* of waiting for in-person class time.  Therefore, readily available face-to-face access is *not* a benefit of asynchronous communication, it's what it *replaces*.

Let's look at why the other options are correct benefits *of* asynchronous communication as described in the text:

*   **A: istikhdam al-internet ka mawred** (using the internet as a resource): The text explicitly mentions the internet and the World Wide Web as tools for accessing information at any time.
*   **C: sa3at 3amal marina** (flexible working hours):  The text states there's ""alqalil min alquyud azzamaniya ma3a imkaniyat sa3at 3amal marina"" (little time constraints with the possibility of flexible working hours).
*   **D: atta7akkum fi al watirat** (paced learning): The text mentions the ability to work according to one's pace and confirm the rate of learning materials.



"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ayun men jawaneb alatesal gheyr alemtezamen atalyh leys marinan li ttullab?","The correct answer is **B: sa3at al3amal (working hours)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...*hunaka alqalil min alquyud azzamaniya ma3a imkaniyat sa3at 3amal marina.*"" (There are few time constraints with the possibility of flexible working hours.)

This directly indicates that flexible working hours are a benefit of asynchronous communication for students. The passage highlights the *lack* of rigid schedules as a positive aspect.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: watirat at3alum (learning pace):** The text mentions the ability to work ""wifqan li darajat taqaddumihim"" (according to their progress), meaning asynchronous communication supports *different* learning paces, it isn't a *feature* of it.
*   **C: al mawad atta3limiya (learning materials):** The text doesn't say access to materials is a benefit specifically of asynchronous communication.
*   **D: istikhdam al-internet (use of the internet):** While the internet *facilitates* asynchronous communication, it is not a component *of* it. The text states it allows access to information, not that it *is* a benefit of the communication method itself.

ma aledy leys medkewraan fi alfqrh ka she2 qed yerbuth almr2 ma3 qala3 al 3usur al wusta?,"The correct answer is **A: 7ufar alzinzana (The dungeons)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions smelling the ""ra2i7at alkhawf almutasa3id min 7ufar alzinzana"" (the scent of fear rising from the dungeons). This directly links the dungeons to the feeling and imagery of the medieval castle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: al mubarazah (The jousting)** - While mentioned, it's one element *within* the castle's history, not something physically tying a person to it.
*   **C: al furusiyya (Chivalry)** -  This is a code of conduct associated with castles, not a physical element.
*   **D: al fursan (The knights)** -  Knights *used* castles, but aren't a structural part of the castle itself.



The question asks what physically connects someone to the medieval castle, and the passage explicitly states that the dungeons evoke a strong, sensory connection."
ayun mema yely leys medkwran fi alfqrh ka ra2i7a aw sawt yumken tadhakurha beyn athar qal3a?,"The correct answer is **C: ma2adem al ta3am (banquets)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the traditional castles of the Middle Ages *inspired* banquets (ma2adem al ta3am), displays of prominence, and Arthurian chivalry. It then talks about imagining sounds and smells within the ruins.  The question asks what is *not* explicitly mentioned as something you could remember *among the ruins* of a castle.

*   **alma3arek (battles)** - The passage refers to battles happening *at* the castle, so remembering them is relevant to the context of being *in* the ruins.
*   **alkhawf (fear)** - The passage directly mentions ""the scent of fear"" that might be imagined.
*   **al7awafir (hooves/clattering)** - The passage mentions ""the clattering of hooves.""
*   **ma2adem al ta3am (banquets)** - While the castle *inspired* banquets, the passage doesn't say you would *remember* a banquet happening *within the ruins themselves*. Banquets were an effect *of* the castle, not something experienced *in* its remnants.

Therefore, banquets are the only option that isn't described as something one might directly experience or imagine while standing among the castle ruins.

* **The passage states:** ""Min al 2umur al mu3tada 5ilal hadhihi al fatra e3tibar qal3at Kirby Muxloe manzilan mu7asanan min kawniha qal3ah 7aqiqiyyah.""  This translates to: ""Among the unusual things for this period was considering Kirby Muxloe Castle an improved dwelling rather than a true castle."" This directly implies the castle's construction wasn't typical.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: talb Lord Hastings judran al qal3ah alsamykh** (Lord Hastings requested thick castle walls) - The passage mentions Hastings *building*, but doesn't specifically say he *requested* thick walls. It emphasizes the period was peaceful and strong defenses weren't needed.
* **B: a7tajet al7ad aladena men alet7syn bisbab teby3eh aleblad alhad2eh fi weqt alebna2** (The builders needed help because of the country's sales at the time of construction) - This isn't mentioned in the text at all.
* **D: buneyt lett7aml hajmat tawyalh wa shadyda** (It was built to withstand long and strong attacks) - The passage *contradicts* this, saying its large windows and thin walls wouldn't withstand a strong attack for long.

(Its large glass windows and thin walls were not capable of withstanding a strong attack...). This directly implies the large windows were a weakness and *not* suitable for a fortified castle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: asas mabney let7amul alhajmat (foundations built to withstand attacks):** The passage doesn't mention anything about the foundations being inadequate.
* **C: t7syenat aqel men b3d alqila3 (fortifications less than other castles):**  The passage states defense was only needed against a small group of marauders, suggesting the level of fortification was *sufficient* for the time.
* **D: judran ra8y8a (thin walls):** The passage *acknowledges* the walls were thin and a weakness, but doesn’t present this as something *unexpected* for that time period – the large windows are the more surprising feature.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aletderb 3la 3bwr albelad jeryaan fi alsyef** (Training on country roads happens in the summer) - The passage mentions races *during* winter, not training specifically in the summer.
* **B: altrekyez 3la seql alser3a khelal aletderyeb** (Focus on increasing speed during training) - While speed is important, the passage emphasizes endurance (""atta7amul"") as crucial, alongside speed.
* **C: f3elha fi aqel men thelath deqa2eq** (Do it in less than three minutes) - The passage refers to completing a standardized number within *two* minutes, not three.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ma3a 7uduth attaghyir min rub3 mil ila nisf mil, tusbi7 assur3a aqal ahamiya bi kathir wa yusbi7 atta7amul darura quswa.""  This translates to: ""With the change from a quarter mile to half a mile, speed becomes much less important and endurance becomes a necessity.""

This directly implies that as the distance increases, prioritizing *endurance* (alqudra 3ala atta7amul) over *speed* (assur3a) is crucial.  Option B captures this trade-off.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aletderb 3la 3bwr alebled jeryaan khelal aِshher alesheta'** (Racing across the country takes place during the winter months) - This is a factual statement from the passage but doesn't answer the question about what becomes less important.

* **D: seql alser3a 3la hesab aleqderh 3la aletheml** (Maintaining speed at the expense of endurance) - This is the *opposite* of what the passage states.



"
"balensebh leryadey, ay un mema yely la yemken theqyeqh feqt men khelal alemmaresat alegheda'eyh?","Let's break down the question and the provided text to determine the correct answer.

**Understanding the Text (P):**

The text (in Arabic) discusses that while a single nutritional approach doesn't guarantee excellent performance, it *can* significantly impact the overall health of young athletes. It emphasizes that maintaining energy balance, practicing orderly exercise, and understanding different aspects of complete athletic practice can *improve performance and increase enjoyment* of sports.

**Understanding the Question (Q):**

The question (in a different dialect, possibly Levantine Arabic) asks: ""For an athlete, what is something that cannot be achieved solely through nutritional guidance?""  (It's a bit colloquial, but that's the gist.)

**Analyzing the Answer Options:**

*   **A: thesyen alada' (strengthening performance)** - The text implies nutrition *contributes* to performance, but isn't the *sole* factor.  This is a strong contender.
*   **B: zeyadh aletmet' (increasing energy)** - Nutrition is *directly* related to increasing energy. This isn't something that can't be achieved through nutrition.
*   **C: ada' memtaz (excellent performance)** - The text *specifically* states a single nutritional approach doesn't *guarantee* excellent performance. This is the best fit.
*   **D: aleshh al3amh (general health)** - Nutrition is vital for general health. This isn't something that can't be achieved through nutrition.

**Conclusion:**

The correct answer is **C: ada' memtaz (excellent performance)**. The text explicitly states that nutrition alone isn't enough to guarantee excellent athletic performance, highlighting the importance of other factors like training and balance.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""يمكن أن يساعد الحفاظ على توازن طاقتي سيحية... على تحسين أداءهم وزيادة استمتاعهم بالرياضة"" (Maintaining energy balance... can help improve their performance and increase their enjoyment of sports).  This directly addresses the question of how young athletes can find more enjoyment in their sports.

Let's look at why the other options are less fitting:

* **A: memaresh aletghedyh alemnasebh (Suitable nutrition practice):** While good nutrition is important, the passage focuses specifically on *energy balance*, which is broader than just nutrition.
* **B: teqdeym ada' 3la mestewa memtaz basetmerar (Continuously providing excellent performance):** This focuses on *achieving* high performance, not *enjoying* the sport more. The passage aims to enhance enjoyment alongside performance.
* **C: aletretyeb alef'eal (Proper action/ordering of actions):**  This refers to the order of exercises/activities, which is mentioned but not the primary focus of the passage's advice for enjoyment.



Therefore, **D** is the most directly supported answer based on the provided text."
"wefqaan llfqrh, lemaza qed yeshetrey 3da2 mesafat metwesth ma3edat akether teklefh?","The correct answer is **D: henak mefaheym khat'eh alety theyt balema3edat alaqel teklefh** (There are misconceptions about the little equipment needed to participate).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...there are many misconceptions regarding what little equipment is required for participation.""  It explains that athletes *feel* they need expensive gear even when it doesn't significantly improve performance. This is the core reason they buy more expensive equipment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: enha tefdeylathem aleshekhesyh (it favors their personality):**  The passage doesn't mention anything about personality preference.
* **B: lha fwa2ed muthebth (it has proven benefits):** The passage states the opposite – much of the equipment has little or no real effect.
* **C: sewf tuhesn men ada'ehem beshekl kebyer (it will greatly improve their performance):** Again, the passage says this isn't usually the case.  The feeling of improvement is often based on misconception.



"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ma aledy yhetaj eleyh 3da2 alemsafat alemtewseth?","The correct answer is **C: ma3edat qelyleh lelghayh** (a few pieces of equipment for the purpose).

* **The passage states:** ""...wa ma3a dhalika, fa inna hunaka al3adid min almfahim alkhati2a fima yt3laq bi ajza2 almu3iddat alqalila almatluba lil musharaka."" ( ""...and yet, there are many misconceptions regarding the few pieces of equipment required for participation."")
* **It also says:** ""Yumkinu shira2 almuntajat 7asab al7aja, wa lakinna mu3dhamaha sayakunu lahu ta2thir dha2il aw laysa lahu ta2thir 7aqiqy 3ala alada2."" ( ""Products can be purchased as needed, but most of them will have little or no real effect on performance."")

This means that middle-distance running doesn't *require* a lot of expensive gear; a few basic items are enough. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: alektheyr men alema3edat** (a lot of equipment) - The passage explicitly states the opposite.
* **B: khelfeyh reyadeyh rasekhh** (a strong athletic background) - While helpful, the passage focuses on *equipment* needs, not prior athletic ability.
* **D: alektheyr men alemal** (a lot of money) - The passage states it's a relatively inexpensive sport.

Therefore, both Bloch and Purcell discovered Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR).

This translates to: ""After three years, the first patent was granted, which was the first patent in the world issued in the field of magnetic resonance imaging.""

It also says Raymond Damadian discovered the basis for using MRI for medical diagnosis in 1970. Therefore, the patent was granted three years later, in 1973/1974.  1974 is the closest and most accurate option.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 1977** - This is the year Damadian *finished building* the first full-body MRI machine, not when the patent was granted.
*   **C: 1930** - This is when NMR was discovered, not when the first MRI patent was granted.
*   **D: 1970** - This is when Damadian made the initial discovery, not when the patent was granted.

"wefqaan llfqrh, ma aledy yejb an yefhemh alebsher beqwh leky yefserwa af'eal alakheryen alejsedyh?","The correct answer is **B: alenyh (النية)** - meaning ""intention"".

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that understanding the *intentions* (niyat) of others is crucial for interpreting their physical actions. The example given – breaking a car window – highlights how the same action can have drastically different meanings depending on *why* someone did it (theft vs. locked keys). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: alerghebh (الرغبة)** - ""desire"" - While desire can *motivate* action, it doesn't directly explain the action itself.
* **C: aleyeman (الإيمان)** - ""belief"" - Belief is internal and doesn't necessarily translate into observable actions.
* **D: alemnezwer (المنظر)** - ""the view/scene"" -  This has nothing to do with understanding *why* someone is acting.



Therefore, the passage stresses that to correctly interpret physical actions, people must understand the **intention** behind them."
"wefqaan llfqrh, yesa'ed fhem alenwaya alebsher 3la aleqyam bemada?","The correct answer is **A: aletkhels men 3dm aleyqeyn wera2 alaf3al alejsedyh** (escaping uncertainty and interpreting physical actions).

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""يسمح لنا بحل الغموض المحتمل في الأفعال الجسدية"" (allows us to resolve potential ambiguity in physical actions). This is exactly what option A describes.  Understanding intent helps us avoid jumping to conclusions based *solely* on what someone does, as illustrated by the broken car window example.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: tewq3 alrghebat** (predicting desires) - While understanding intent *can* help us understand desires, the passage focuses on resolving ambiguity in *actions*, not directly predicting wants.
* **C: alnzar llbashar alakheryen bedwen 7ukm** (looking at others without judgment) - The passage is about *informed* judgment, not avoiding it altogether.  Understanding intent *allows* for fairer judgment.
* **D: qera2t 3qewl alakheryen** (reading others' minds) -  The passage frames understanding intent as a *part* of reading minds, but it's specifically about deciphering the reasons *behind* actions, not directly reading thoughts.

The passage states that AI research focuses on *building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior*.  It then lists examples like ""attakhtit wal jadawel"" (planning and scheduling).  While recognizing speech and faces, and performing tasks generally are *applications* of AI, the *core goal* is to create systems that can *plan* and execute intelligently.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: alet3eref 3la aleswet (التعرف على الأصوات)** - recognizing sounds. This is *an application* of AI, not the overarching goal.

* **D: aleqyam balemham beshekl aley (القيام بالمهام بشكل آلي)** - performing tasks automatically. While automation is a *result* of AI, the passage emphasizes the *intelligent* aspect of those tasks – meaning the machine needs to *plan* how to do them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: khedmh al3mala' (customer service)** - While AI *can* be used for customer service, the passage doesn't specifically highlight it as a common application.
* **C: alekheyal al'elemy (scientific imagination)** - The passage states AI *draws* on scientific imagination but isn't itself primarily about it.
* **D: alet'eref 3la khet aleyd (handwriting recognition)** - This is *an example* of an AI capability mentioned, but not a main, frequently-used application according to the text.

Taking time (akhed alemr' lewqeth) is the *opposite* of speed and isn't a characteristic of this type of thinking.  It's more aligned with divergent thinking, which involves exploring many possibilities.

"wefqaan llfqrh, ayun mema yely la yu'etebr men alet'eabeyr aledqeyqh lelwejh?","The correct answer is **B: 3aqd alejbeyn (furrowing of the eyebrows)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses *minute expressions* and *facial movements that last fractions of a second*. It's about subtle cues to detect deception.

*   **3aqd alejbeyn (furrowing of the eyebrows)** is a relatively *sustained* expression, not a fleeting, fractional-second movement. While it *can* indicate negative emotions, it's not the type of brief, involuntary microexpression the text focuses on for lie detection.

Let's look at why the other options are more consistent with the passage's description:

*   **A: alenzer b'eyedaan athena' alethedth (a glance with both eyes when speaking):** This *could* be a very brief, nuanced movement.
*   **C: alermesh besr'eh (a quick blink):**  Definitely a very fast, almost subconscious movement.
*   **D: ref' alebham (a twitch of the eyebrow):**  A quick, involuntary movement, fitting the description of a microexpression.

The passage emphasizes deciphering *subtle* and *brief* facial cues. Furrowing your eyebrows is a more noticeable, held expression.

* **The passage states:** ""...yumkin lilmar2 2ktishaf ma etha kan al-shakh9 yakthib min khilal tafsyr al-ta3byrat al-da8y8a bishakl 9a7y7.""  This translates to ""...a person can discover if someone is lying through the interpretation of fleeting expressions in a real way.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: adet tesjeylat alefyedyew ela teqdemat hamh** (Video recordings led to important advances) - While true, this is a *result* of the study, not what the study *is* about regarding facial expressions.
* **C: yufesr aleklam baledafh ela alet'eabeyr alewjeyhh** (Interpreting speech instead of facial expressions) - This is the opposite of what the passage discusses. It's about interpreting *facial* expressions, even when speech is impaired.
* **D: yemkenha alemsa'edh fi teqyeym alesdeq** (It can help in evaluating truthfulness) - This is too general. The passage focuses on *how* it helps – through interpreting subtle expressions to *detect lies*.

ayun mema yely asebh akether ahemyh netyejhan 3a9r al-nah'9a? ,"The correct answer is **B: tedawel alema3erefh (circulation of knowledge)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""La8ad a7dath 3a9r al-nah'9a taghyiran jawharian hamman fy 6ary8ati al-ta3allum wanashr al-ma3rifa.""  This translates to: ""The digital revolution has caused a fundamental change in the way of learning and *spreading knowledge*.""

The passage highlights that the *method* of getting information has changed.  It's no longer about individual memorization (making A, C, and D less relevant) but about how knowledge is *distributed* and accessed.  The digital revolution's biggest impact is the ease with which information can circulate.

Let's break down why the other options are less correct:

*   **A: altdekr alfardy (individual memory):** The passage actually says individual memorization is *less* important.
*   **C: tedker alens (human memory):**  Similar to A, the passage points to a shift *away* from relying heavily on individual memory.
*   **D: al7osol 3la alema3elewmat (getting information):** While getting information *is* affected, the more significant change is *how* it's accessed and *shared*.

The passage (P) states: ""Lam ya3ud hunaka dhaght fi al-istid3a2 al fardy, lakinna alqudra 3ala tadhakkur annas asba7at akthara tarkizan.""  This translates to: ""There is no longer pressure on individual preparation, but the ability to remember people has become more focused.""

This directly indicates a *decrease* in emphasis on individual memorization (altdekr alfardy) due to the shift caused by the digital age.  The focus has shifted *away* from needing to individually commit things to memory.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: al7osol 3ala alema3erefh (obtaining knowledge):** The passage doesn't say obtaining knowledge is less focused on; it says *how* we obtain knowledge has changed.
* **C: tedker alens (remembering people):** The passage says remembering *people* is *more* focused on, not less.
* **D: al7osol 3la alema3erefhetwezy' alema3elewmat (obtaining knowledge and distributing information):** While the passage discusses changes in how knowledge is spread, it doesn't say there's less focus on obtaining knowledge itself.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically mentions ""al3alaqat almustamirra"" (ongoing relationships) as a motivating factor for internet use.** Staying in touch with family directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eqamh shebkat ala'emal (Establishing a professional network):** While the internet *can* be used for networking, the passage doesn't mention this as a core motivation discussed by the cited studies.
* **C: alebheth lelsefr (Searching for travel):**  This is a use of the internet, but not a core *motivation* for its sustained use or relationship building, as discussed in the passage.

**Translation of relevant passage sections:**

* ""...the internet falls between mass communication and personal communication...""
* ""...the distinguishing characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage approach and satisfaction. For example, ""learning"" and ""social interaction"" were identified as important motivations for using the internet...""

The passage focuses on motivations for internet use related to *personal connection* and *social interaction*. It specifically mentions:

*   **""atta3alum"" (learning)**
*   **""attanshi2a al ijtima3iyya"" (socialization)**
*   **""almusharakat alshakhsiyya"" (personal sharing)**
*   **""al3alaqat almustamirra"" (maintaining relationships)**

Let's break down why the other options *are* related to personal/social motivations:

*   **A: alebheth 3an wesfh (Searching for recipes):** While seemingly simple, sharing recipes and food interests can be a social activity and a way to connect with others.
*   **B: alensher 3la lewhh menaqeshh 3la alenetrent (Posting on internet discussion boards):** This is *directly* a form of social interaction and personal expression.
*   **D: edarh alesh'ewen alemaleyh (Managing global affairs):**  This could be seen as a form of civic engagement and connecting with a wider community, representing a social motivation.

Searching for health products (**C**) is a transactional activity – it's about obtaining information for a practical purpose, not inherently about building or maintaining personal relationships. While it *could* be connected to personal wellbeing, it doesn't fall within the stated motivations discussed in the text regarding personal/social connection.

Therefore, option C is the one that *least* reflects a motivation for using the internet for personal/social interaction, as described in the provided passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: khelal alheqbh alebyeznetyh (during the Byzantine era)** - The text says Europe *initially* was influenced by Byzantium, but then moved *away* from it.
*   **C: hewaley 25 3amaan b3d al'esewr alewseta (about 25 years after the Middle Ages)** - This is incorrect because the change began *with* the end of the Middle Ages, not after.

kan asetkhedam alazerar lerbet alemlabes netyejh lemaza? ,"The correct answer is **B: alheqbh alebyeznetyh** (الحقب البيزنطية - The Byzantine Era).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Fil bidaya t2aththara aththawb bi shidda bil thaqafa al Bizantiya fil shareq."" (Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.) and later ""...bada2a al-ashkha9 fy 2shtikhdam al-azrar le2i7kam rab6 malabisihim."" (...people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes).

This implies the adoption of buttons happened *after* and potentially *as a result of* influence from Byzantine culture.  The Byzantine Empire was known for using decorative buttons and clasps in their clothing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: alfatra aleqwetyh** (الفترة القوطية - The Gothic Period): The passage mentions a time *between* the 10th, 11th, and 13th centuries, predating the peak of Gothic fashion.
* **C: alherweb alesleybeyh** (الحروب الصليبية - The Crusades): While the Crusades are mentioned as a cause of major shifts, they are presented as a catalyst for *later* developments, not the initial reason for using buttons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: meqat'eh kheyarat nemt alheyah alemterf (reducing extravagant lifestyles)** - While the passage *suggests* living more in harmony with nature, it doesn't present this as the primary action for solving environmental problems. It's a contributing factor, but not the fundamental step.

* **D: an yesbh alemr' helyefaan lel7erkh aleby'eyh (making the matter an ally to the environmental movement)** - This is a vague phrasing and doesn’t capture the core idea of addressing the underlying issues.



Therefore, **C** directly reflects the passage's emphasis on identifying and addressing the *source* of the environmental problems."

The passage explicitly states: ""إذا كنا لا نريد حلاً مؤقتًا فحسب، فعلينا أن نجيد جذور المشكلة وحلها."" (If we don't want just a temporary solution, we must find the roots of the problem and solve them).  This directly corresponds to addressing the root causes, not just treating symptoms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: alanekherat fi alensateyh** (reducing consumption) - While mentioned as a possible action (""حتى أن نصبح نشطاء من أجل تخفيف المعاناة المستقبلية...""), it's presented as *one* potential solution, not the fundamental approach.
* **C: alet'ebeyr 3an alara' 7wl kheyarat nemt alheyah alemterf** (thinking about the impact on lifestyle choices) - This is a good thing to do, but it’s a component of finding solutions, not the solution itself.

The passage draws an analogy to treating a disease with symptoms.  Treating symptoms (like reducing consumption or eco-friendly living) helps, but doesn't *cure* the problem.  Finding the root cause (like population growth, excessive consumerism driven by technological advancement) is the key to a lasting solution.

It also clarifies this war marked a shift *away* from religious justification for European wars.

This translates to: ""The central authority of the church was in Rome for over a thousand years, and the concentration of power and wealth there led many to question whether this belief was being acted upon.""

The question asks what aspect of the Catholic Church *wasn't* being adhered to. The passage explicitly states that the concentration of power raised questions about whether the church was fulfilling its core tenet of using wealth to alleviate suffering and poverty.  Therefore, the centralization of power is the issue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eda kan tewzey' aletherwh demn alekneysh menasebaan** (If the distribution of wealth within the church was appropriate) - The passage doesn't say the distribution was appropriate, only that people *questioned* if the church's core beliefs were being followed.
* **B: eda kan yejb t'edeyl mettelbat 'eqeydh aledyanh** (If it was necessary to fulfill the requirements of religious belief) - The passage focuses on the *application* of a religious belief (helping the poor), not the belief itself.
* **D: ma eda kan yetm alewfa' bemtetlebat aler'eyesyh l'eqeydh alekneysh** (Whether the requirements of the church's doctrine were being met) -  This is too broad. The passage focuses on the specific doctrine of using wealth for the poor.

* **A: la teqleq men tekbedk lesabat (Don't move from your strength/safety)** - This is a general safety tip, but not directly related to *observing the situation first*.
* **B: qeym alemshhed qebl aledheyh (Assess the scene before approaching)** - This *directly* reflects the advice in the passage P to ""mula7azt wadh3 aldha7iya"" (observe the situation) and ""al-intbah ila ay 3lamat ta7ziriya tilqa2iya"" (be aware of any warning signs).

ayun men aletgheyyerat alety sebbetha alethewrh alefrenseyh kan lha tatheyr kebyer 3la mewateny aletbeqh al3amelh?,"The correct answer is **B: t7wl fi aletrekyez men aletbeqh ela alekfa'h** (a shift in focus from class to capability/merit).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""بعد الثورة، كانت المهن مفتوحة لجميع المتقدمين المؤهلين...فقد أصبحوا الآن يعتمدون على درجة التميز والأهمية"" (After the revolution, professions were open to all qualified applicants… they now rely on degree of excellence and importance). This clearly indicates a shift *away* from social class determining opportunity and *toward* merit and ability. This applies to both professions and the army.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: azedyad aled'em lelamh** (increased inspiration) - While the revolution *was* inspirational, the passage doesn't highlight this as a *change* it brought *to* working-class citizens within France itself. It mentions inspiring others *in other countries*.
* **C: tebney alayedyewlewjeyh alejmhewreyh** (adoption of a republican ideology) - This is a change that happened *because* of the revolution, but doesn't directly explain how it affected the working class's opportunities.
* **D: nezam qeyas jedyed** (a new system of measurement) - This is a minor detail mentioned in the passage and is not directly relevant to the opportunities available to the working class.



Therefore, the shift in focus from birth/class to capability is the most direct change the French Revolution brought to the working class citizens, as described in the text."
"b3d alethewrh alefrenseyh, kan alenjah fi alejyesh walemhen alakhera aqel ahetmalaan lan yekwen mebneyaan 3la mada?","The correct answer is **A: alenejaz (achievements)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""بدلان من أن تعتمد رتبة الجيش على الفيء، فقد أصبحوا الآن يعتمدون على درجة التميز والأهمية."" (Instead of the army rank being based on lineage/wealth, it has become based on the degree of excellence and importance/achievements).

This clearly indicates that advancement in the army after the French Revolution was based on **achievements** (alenejaz) and merit, not on family background or social status.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: aletbeqh (lineage/wealth)** - The passage specifically states the army *stopped* relying on this.
*   **C: aletmewh (status)** - While related to 'importance', 'achievements' is the more direct and specific factor mentioned in the context of army rank.
*   **D: al'eyar (defects/flaws)** - This is completely unrelated to the passage's discussion of army advancement.

ay khedmh 3amh yuqal anha alakether tesbebaan balasetya' fi alebledan alemteqdemh?,"The question (P) discusses transportation systems and frequent complaints about their quality, contrasting this with developed countries where such issues are rare. It asks *why* these problems arise and *why* they fail so often, questioning if it's due to incompetent engineers or a deeper, more fundamental issue.

The question (Q) asks which public service is most often criticized in developed countries.

Given the context of P focusing on transportation issues, the most logical answer is **C: alenqel al3am (public transportation)**. 

Here's why:

* **P's focus:** The entire passage revolves around issues with transportation systems (""anzimat annaql"").
* **Logical connection:** If transportation systems are failing and causing complaints (as described in P), it makes sense that public transportation would be a common target of criticism in any country, especially developed ones where higher standards are expected.
* **Other options are less relevant:**
    * **A: jewdh alemyah (water quality):** While important, water quality isn't directly connected to the transportation theme.
    * **B: bena' alejsewr (bridge construction):**  Bridges are *part* of infrastructure, but the broader discussion in P is about the whole system, not just bridges.  P even mentions bridges falling down as an *example* of things that don't happen often in developed countries, implying it's not a widespread, consistent complaint.
    * **D: alta3lem (education):** Education is a crucial service, but it's unrelated to the transportation problems discussed.

* **The passage states:** ""aljami3 taqriban min anzimat annaql. yashtaki..."" (almost everyone complains about public transport systems...) This directly translates to public transport *causing* complaints.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: yhebha jami3 men yestekhedmha** (everyone who uses it loves it) - The passage clearly states people *complain* about it, the opposite of loving it.
* **B: leyset benfes sew' jewdh alemyah** (is not of the same quality as global quality) - While implied, the passage focuses on the *frequency* of complaints, not necessarily a quality comparison. The example of developed countries highlights this difference.
* **D: hey mejaneyh fi aghelb aledwel alemteqdemh** (is free in most developed countries) - The passage doesn't mention whether it's free or not. It focuses on the *lack* of complaints in developed countries.

This translates to: ""For this reason, the study of traffic flow is considered a difficult matter because it is impossible to predict the behavior of drivers with 100% accuracy.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly identifies **traffic flow** as being difficult to measure due to the unpredictable nature of driver behavior.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: tekhetyet aletreq (layout of the road)**: Road layout is a factor in traffic, but not the specifically difficult-to-predict element mentioned.
*   **C: teshegheyl aletreq (operation of the road)**: This refers to managing the road, and isn't the inherently unpredictable aspect discussed in the text."

The passage focuses on mathematically representing traffic flow *using* density, flow, and speed.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: teshegheyl aletreq (operation of roads):** While the models *help* with operation, operation isn't a *component* used in the mathematical representation itself.
* **B: selwek alesa'eq (driver behavior):** The text acknowledges driver behavior is unpredictable, which is *why* a mathematical model is necessary to approximate traffic flow. It doesn't *use* driver behavior directly in the representation.
* **C: tesmeym aletreq (road design):**  Like operation, design is *aided* by the models, but isn't a direct input to the mathematical representation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: meqdar alemadh alewratheyh alemtatherh (the amount of genetic material affected):** While the extent of genetic material impacted can be *a* factor, the passage emphasizes the *type* of change first.

* The passage then clarifies that *telescopes* (with two lenses) were first made in Europe in the late 16th century.  However, the question asks about using lenses to *magnify things*, not about telescopes specifically.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Muhammad (SAW) frequently retreating to a cave called ""Hira"" on Mount Nawr for contemplation.** This cave is described as being completely isolated, where he could be alone with his thoughts and the universe.  This directly implies a need for solitude and time spent in isolation for spiritual practice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: hew yeqder aleslam wal'euzelh (He appreciates peace and isolation)** - While the passage *describes* isolation, it doesn't state he *appreciates* it; it shows he *sought* it for a purpose.  Appreciation is an interpretation, not a directly stated fact.
* **B: yemken leldejyej alekharejy an yusa'ed fi aletfekr (External stimuli can help with thinking)** - The passage specifically states the opposite - the cave isolates him *from* all external stimuli.
* **D: kan yetweq leky yura weyusema3 (He longed to see and hear)** -  The passage states he could see very little and hear very little *within* the cave, implying the opposite of longing for sensory input.

Here's why:

The text states that iron wheels were introduced because they allowed for *sa7b a7mal akbar* (carrying larger loads) than the wooden wheels. While they initially caused more wear on the wooden carriages, the ability to carry heavier loads was the driving force behind their adoption.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: lanha zadet ser'eh alahesnh** (Because they increased speed): The text mentions the carriages allowed for *sur3a akbar* (greater speed) generally with the introduction of carriages, but doesn't specifically state iron wheels *increased* speed compared to wooden wheels.

*   **D: alettewr aletkenwelwejy leys mebneyaan 3la aletatheyr alesyasey** (the development of technology is not based on political influence) - While the passage states technology transcends *both* cultural and political influence, the question asks for what doesn't reflect the passage's thinking. Saying it's not based on political influence is *in* the passage, not challenging it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: theml alewzen (carrying weight):** While chimpanzees use their hands for weight-bearing during knuckle-walking, the passage highlights that *humans* no longer do this. The evolution is *away* from this function.
* **C: al7araka (movement):** The passage specifically states the hands transitioned *from* being primarily for movement.
* **D: alemshey 3la mefasel alasab' (walking on knuckles):** This is a chimpanzee characteristic, not the evolutionary path of human hands.

(The discovery of fossil hand bones... about this transformation in the specialization of the hand from movement to manipulation.) This implies that the chimpanzee hand, being closer to the ancestral form, is *better suited for* and therefore *more resistant to* the stresses of movement and weight-bearing than the human hand which has evolved for manipulation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ayedyhem waqedamhem mekhetlefh alhejm** (Their hands and feet are different in size) - The passage *highlights* that chimpanzee hands and feet are similar in size, the opposite of this statement.
* **C: tusetkhedm letheml alewzen** (They are used to carry weights) - While they *can* carry weights, the passage focuses on the *reason* they are built for it (ancestral weight-bearing locomotion).
* **D: tusetkhedm beshekl r'eyesy lelmenawerh** (They are used mainly for maneuvering) - The passage states human hands are now specialized for manipulation, not chimpanzee hands.

yezyel alanetqa' alakhetlafat alewratheyh alejdeydh men ay tejmey'eh?,"The correct answer is **A: مستترة (Mustatirah - Hidden)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a process of genetic variation.** It states there are hidden (مخفية) and apparent (ظاهرة) genetic variations.  A new genetic variation is *added* and *removed* from a pool of variations that are understood (مجموعة التباين المعبر عنه - the group of expressed variations).  The shuffling and recombination (الفصل وإعادة التركيب) involves switching between the hidden and expressed groups with each generation.
* **The question (Q) asks where the new variations come from.** It's asking what group contributes the new genetic difference.
* **""Mestetrah"" (Hidden)** directly corresponds to the ""مخفية"" variations described in the passage as the source from which the new variation is drawn.  The process *pulls* a variation from the hidden pool into the expressed pool.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: e'eadh aletrekyeb (Recombination):** This is *part* of the process, but not the *source* of the new variation.  It's how variations are shuffled, not where they originate.
* **C: alefsel (Separation/Division):** This is also part of the process, describing the splitting of variations, but not the origin of new ones.
* **D: ma3eberh (Expressed):** The passage describes variations *moving* into the expressed pool, not originating *from* it.  



Therefore, **A: مستترة (Mestatirah - Hidden)** is the only option that accurately represents the source of new genetic variation as described in the passage."

The question asks what operation is responsible for adding differences and inheritance.  The passage clearly links *separation* to the changing of variations.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: e'eadh aletrekyeb (Recombination):** While recombination *happens*, the passage says it works *with* separation, not that it *causes* the differences.
* **C: aletferh (The difference):** This is a result, not a process.
* **D: ma3eberh (Expression):**  This doesn't relate to the creation of new genetic variations.

Here's why:

* **The Passage:** The passage states that children develop awareness of racial stereotypes very early, and these stereotypes *affect behavior*. Specifically, it gives the example of children from minority groups being *conditioned* to expect poor school performance simply by learning about their group's societal position. This conditioning leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy.

* **How Stereotypes Affect Behavior:** The passage implies that the negative stereotype *reduces* the likelihood of positive behavior (like good school performance).  It doesn't say they *will* avoid negative behavior (A), it doesn't say they'll simply fit into society (C), and it certainly doesn't say they'll reject their racial group (D).

* **Therefore:** The most logical conclusion, based on the passage, is that a child who internalizes a negative stereotype about their racial group will be *less likely* to engage in behaviors that challenge that stereotype – they may subconsciously limit their own expectations and opportunities.

It then gives an example of how stereotypes about a child's ethnicity can lead to expectations of poor school performance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

The text describes ""wild children"" (wu7shy/mutawa7ish) as those who have *not* been properly socialized by adults due to neglect, abuse, or abandonment. They are often raised by animals or live in the wilderness *alone*.  Therefore, a key characteristic is their independent existence, a direct result of lacking normal human upbringing.

*   **D: zeyadh herkat al'eyen alesrey'eh fi alelyelh** (increased rapid eye movement in the night) - The text states *less* REM is the problem, not more.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Takhdha3 alfiraq al-iftiradhiya li ma3ayir attamyiz nafsiha allati takhdha3u laha alfiraq attaqlidiya..."" This translates to ""Virtual teams take standards to distinguish themselves that are taken by traditional teams...""  This directly implies virtual teams *provide* tools/standards *to* traditional teams.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: yemtelk kela new'ey alefreq mestewyat men alasetqelal fi rewteynhem aleywemy:** The passage specifically states virtual teams generally have *more* independence than traditional teams, not the same level.
* **C: yubelgh kela new'ey alefreq ela feryeq edarh khefy:** The passage discusses a ""non-conforming team"" (fariq ghayr mar2i) which is a unique aspect of *virtual* teams, not a common feature of both.
* **D: y3mal kela new'ey alefreq fi nefs alemnetqh alezmenyh:** The passage highlights that virtual teams often consist of members from different time zones, which is the opposite of working in the same time frame.

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Ya3malu a3dha2 alfariq al-iftiradhy ghaliban ka nuqtat ittisal li majmu3atihim almadiya almubashira."" (Some virtual teams often work as a point of contact for their immediate social community.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: alefreq aletqelyedyh mutalebh betheqyeq ma3eayir a3la** (Traditional teams require higher standards) - The text states virtual teams *adopt* criteria from traditional teams, not that traditional teams have *higher* standards.
* **C: temtelk alefreq aletqelyedyh asetqelaleyh aqel men alefreq alafetradeyh** (Virtual teams have less independence than traditional teams) - The text states the *opposite*: virtual teams often have *more* independence.

This translates to: ""This theory looks into the things that make people desire what they do, and the things in their environment that make them do certain things or refrain from doing them.""  This directly relates to how the environment influences behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: alerghebat alejdeydh alety tezher fi merhelh aleblewgh** (new desires that appear in the stage of maturity) - While the passage *mentions* desires developing with maturity, it's not the central focus of the theory itself.
* **C: alhajat alety tezher dateyaan** (needs that appear continuously) - The passage connects needs to maturity, not a continuous appearance.
* **D: fhem e'ejabat alenas** (understanding people's responses) - Understanding responses is a *result* of applying the theory, not the theory's core subject.

ayun mema yely leys hedfaan men ahedaf qa'edh aletthelyeth?,"The passage (P) describes the Rule of Thirds – a guiding principle in composition that creates dynamic movement while maintaining order in an image. It states the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally.

The question (Q) asks which of the following is **NOT** a goal of the Rule of Thirds. Let's break down the options:

* **A: enesha' munetleq lelmekan aledy qed yewd' feyh alemwedw'** (Create a balance for the space in which the subject is located) - This *is* a goal. The Rule of Thirds aims to create harmonious composition.
* **B: enesha' heyah wetaqh demn sewrh** (Create a life and strength within the image) - This *is* a goal. Dynamic placement contributes to a more engaging image.
* **C: ebeqa' alemwedw' demn mekan mhedd wef'eal** (Keep the subject within a defined and effective location) - This *is* a goal.  The intersections are defined, effective locations.
* **D: taseys nezam demn sewrh** (Establish order within the image) - This *is* also a goal. The passage explicitly mentions maintaining order (""al 7ifaz 3ala qadr min al tartib"").

Therefore, none of the options are *not* a goal of the Rule of Thirds. However, option **D (taseys nezam demn sewrh - Establish order within the image)** is the *least* direct goal. The primary focus is on *dynamic* placement, and order is a *result* of that placement, not the initial aim.  The Rule of Thirds isn't about imposing rigid order, but about creating a visually appealing balance *through* dynamic positioning.

**Therefore, the best answer is D.**

The passage explicitly states: ""**...nisbat al-3ar'9 ela al-artifa3 8ad 2ktasabatha tansy8at mustash3ir 9uwar al-kamyra al-ra8miya.**"" which translates to ""...the aspect ratio was acquired by the sensor formats of digital cameras.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ma tezal tunetj** (it is still produced) - While true, the passage highlights the *impact* of the 35mm format, not just its continued production.
* **C: lha nesbh ab'ead mekhetlefh 3an al3adid men aletnesyeqat alesha'e'eh** (it has different dimensions than many common formats) - The passage actually states many common formats *equal* or *approximate* its aspect ratio.
* **D: hey alesyeghh alakether sheyw'eaan fi al'ealem** (it is the most common format in the world) - While stated initially, the passage focuses on its lasting *influence* on digital formats, not its current prevalence.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."

This translates to: ""This problem has become less of an issue as lens manufacturers meet higher standards in lens production. This has allowed zoom lenses to produce images with quality comparable to that of lenses with a fixed focal length.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: lha ser'eat 'edesat a3la** (it has a higher lens speed): The passage specifically says zoom lenses *generally have a lower* aperture (speed).
* **B: hey ashel asetkhedamaan fi zerwef aleda'h alemnekhefdh** (it is easier to use in low-light conditions):  The passage states the opposite - low speed makes it *difficult* to use in low light.
* **D: lha t'eqeyd b'erey aqel men al'edesat alawelyh** (it has less distortion than the primary lens): The passage doesn't discuss distortion.

Here's why:

The passage states a disadvantage of magnifying lenses (عدسات التكبير) is that they *usually have a lower aperture (speed)*. This makes them difficult to use in low-light conditions *without a flash*.  Therefore, a prime lens (عدسة رئيسية) would be preferable if you want to avoid using a flash in low light.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eda kanet alefthh alaqesa al'ealeyh awelweyh** (if the required lens quality is higher) - The passage says manufacturing improvements have *reduced* the quality issue with magnifying lenses.
* **B: eda aredt 3anaser 'edesat aqel** (if you want fewer lens elements) - The passage states magnifying lenses require *more* elements, not fewer.
* **D: eda kent tebheth 3an t'eqeyd b'erey akebr** (if you're looking for a larger recording area) - This isn’t discussed in the passage. The passage focuses on the *quality* of images, not the area recorded.

* **The passage emphasizes that Sufism is *distinguished* from other forms of religious belief and worship *by* its focus on direct, personal experience of a unique state of consciousness.** Option D acknowledges this focus on personal experience but points out it *can be compared* with other beliefs, meaning it's not a unique defining characteristic *enough* to be a precise description of Sufism.  The passage is about what *sets it apart*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: henak terkeyz 3la tejrebh halat alederak aleslemyh walembhejh** - This is *part* of the description of Sufism (seeking states of peaceful understanding and ecstasy), but doesn't encompass the *entire* definition.
* **B: ateba' aleswefyh yes'ewen lew'ey ederakey lheqyeqh rewhaneyh** - This (Sufis seeking awareness of spiritual truth) is stated directly in the passage and therefore *is* a description of Sufism, not something that isn't.
* **C: qed yetbena ateba' aleswefyh memaresat tesa'ed fi t'ezeyz r'eyethem lelheqyeqh alelheyh** -  This (Sufis engaging in practices to increase their insight into divine truth) is also directly stated in the passage and *is* a descriptive element.



Therefore, only option D points out a nuance that makes it *not* a precise, defining description of Sufism – the potential overlap with experiences found in other religions."
"wefqaan llfqrh, ayun mema yely leys demn terkeyz aleswefyh?","The correct answer is **B: ales'ey ela r'eyh men khelal aletjareb alemshetrekh walejma'eyh** (Seeking it through shared and collective experiences).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) emphasizes *personal, direct experience* (attajruba al sha5siya al mubashara) of a unique state of consciousness.**  It specifically contrasts Sufism with other forms of religious belief and worship by highlighting this individual experience.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ales'ey wera' alhedth ela alheqyeqh alelheyh** (Seeking and talking about the divine truth) - While Sufis *do* discuss divine truth, the passage focuses on the *experiencing* of it, not just talking about it.
* **C: terkeyz 3la halh alederak alembhejh** (Focusing on the state of joyful perception) - Joyful perception is *a result* of the Sufi experience, but it's not the central *focus* of the practice. The focus is on attaining that state through direct experience.
* **D: ales'ey ela ederak wa'ey lelelh** (Seeking awareness of the divine) - This is too general. Many religions seek awareness of the divine.  The passage distinguishes Sufism by the *way* that awareness is sought - through *personal, direct experience*.

Option B is the opposite of what the passage describes. Sufism is about *individual* experience, not shared or collective ones.  Therefore, the question asks what is *NOT* a focus of Sufism.

This translates to: ""Then the theory was established that the Maori people migrated from Polynesia in great fleets, then took New Zealand from the Moriori and established an agricultural society there.""

Therefore, according to the passage, the Maori people from Polynesia established the agricultural society in New Zealand.

Here's why:

Therefore, according to the passage, the Maori were believed to be the first inhabitants of New Zealand.

The question asks in what scenario this simple origami method would be *most* helpful for a modeler (presumably someone creating models, like origami).

Let's break down the options:

* **A: alemjeld yefdel aleqyam b'edh teyat ma3eaan (The modeler prefers to perform tasks with simple folds)** - This is the **most direct and logical answer**. The technique *is* designed for simplicity, so a modeler who prefers simple folds would benefit.

* **C: alemjeld yesn' aweryejamey tettelb teyat 'ekesyh (The modeler is making origami that requires complex folds)** -  This technique *avoids* complex folds, so it wouldn't be helpful here.
* **D: alemjeld jerbha sabeqaan lemrh wahedh aw merteyn feqt (The modeler has tried it before once or twice only)** -  This doesn't explain *why* the technique would be helpful, just that they've tried it.

* **Option D translates to:** ""It is a good method for children with limited motor skills.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** (Translation is unclear and doesn't relate to the passage)
* **B:** (Focuses on the *method* not being folded in a complex way, but the passage is about *who* it helps)
* **C:** (States the folds must be direct - a characteristic of the technique, but doesn't answer the question of *who* it's for).



Therefore, option D directly reflects the information provided in the passage about the purpose of John Smith's origami technique."
"wefqaan llfqrh, ay mewq' leys mertebtaan bhedarh wadey alesned?","The correct answer is **B: nher Sarasvati** (the Sarasvati River).

Here's why:

The passage states that some scholars *hypothesize* the civilization extended to the dried-up Sarasvati River basin and should be called the Indus-Sarasvati civilization. However, it explicitly links the civilization's name (""Wadi Assend/Indus"") to the Indus River (""nahr Assend""). The Sarasvati River connection is a debated possibility, *not* a core part of the civilization's definition as presented in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Harappa:** The text explicitly states Harappa is one of the *first sites* excavated of this civilization.
*   **C: jami3 alemnateq fi shemal sherq Afghanistan:** The passage says the civilization included ""some regions"" in northeast Afghanistan, so this is a related area.
*   **D: ma3ezem Pakistan alhedyethh:** The text directly states the civilization covered most of modern-day Pakistan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: hedarh alesned wa Sarasvati (The Indus and Sarasvati Civilization):** While the passage *mentions* the possibility of calling it the Indus-Sarasvati civilization, it's presented as a suggestion debated by scholars, not the universally accepted name.
* **C: hedarh nher alesned (The Indus River Civilization):**  This is too narrow. The civilization extended beyond just the Indus River.
* **D: hedarh wadey alesned (The Indus Valley Civilization):** This is a correct translation of ""7adarat Wadi Assend"" and is a valid name for the civilization. However, the question asks for the name *specifically* used after the discovery of Harappa, as indicated in the text.

"wefqaan llfqrh, ay mema yely yheqq fa'edh tewyelh alajel?","The correct answer is **A: alt'eawen ma3 alakheryen (cooperation with others)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: e'eta' alawelweyh lelmesalh aledateyh lelferd (giving priority to the immediate interest of the individual)** - The passage *contrasts* this with the long-term benefit of cooperation.
* **C: aletakeyd 3la ma yemken an y'ewed balefa'edh lelaqelyh 3la hesab alaghelbeyh (focusing on what can return with benefit to the minority at the expense of the majority)** - This describes selfishness and is presented as a short-term gain, *not* a long-term one.
* **D: ederak an alejsh' yemken an yekwen mefyedaan (realizing that life can be beneficial)** - This is a general statement and doesn't address the specific question of what benefits long-term well-being, as discussed in the passage.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) argues that selfishness (al-ananiya) is *always* present.** It states that even when cooperation benefits the majority, there will *always* be some who seek short-term gains through selfish behavior.
* **The question (Q) asks what a person focused on immediate benefits (""alefwa'ed alefweryh"") would prioritize.**  Someone focused on immediate benefits would act selfishly to maximize their own gain *now*, without considering long-term cooperative outcomes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aleyethar (الإيثار - Altruism):** This is the *opposite* of what the question is asking. Altruism is prioritizing others.
* **B: aleshterak (الاشتراك - Partnership/Collaboration):**  The passage acknowledges partnership *is* the better long-term choice, but the question focuses on someone prioritizing *immediate* benefits.
* **C: alt'eawen (التعاون - Cooperation):** Similar to 'aleshterak', this is the long-term ideal but not what a person focused on *immediate* gains would do.



Therefore, **al-ananiya (selfishness)** is the most fitting answer because the passage highlights its constant presence, especially when immediate gratification is prioritized."
"wefqaan llfqrh, men gheta jez'aan kebyeraan men nefqat alherb?","The correct answer is **D: alesh'eb aleflebyeny (the Filipino people)**.

Therefore, the Filipino people were the ones who bore a large part of the war's expenses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: alhekwemh aleflebyenyh (the Filipino government):** While the colonial government collected taxes, the passage says the *people* were forced to pay them.  The government was a tool of the American empire.
* **B: mesaref wewl setreyt (Wall Street banks):** The passage mentions Wall Street banks *receiving* the funds, not *paying* the expenses.
* **C: alenzam alaset'emarey alameryeky (the American colonial system):**  The system *collected* the money, it didn't *spend* it directly.  The money came from the Filipino people.

    * **B** refers to scopolamine use.
    * **C** refers to arterial clamps to stop bleeding.
    * **D** refers to amputation for gangrene.
* **However, the question asks for the treatment *not* specifically mentioned.**  The passage doesn’t directly state they had a general “wound treatment” with diverse potions, but implies it through the specific examples of morphine and scopolamine. Therefore, A is the best fit.

* **D: tejneyd alemebratewr lelateba'** (the emperor's recruitment of students) - The passage states recruitment of *doctors* (a6ibba2), not students.

* **B: al mu3allem hwa janeb asasey farid men naw3h llssi5iyya** (The teacher is a unique and fundamental aspect of Sikhism) - While the passage *does* highlight the importance of the Guru (teacher), it states this role is common in Indian religions generally, not uniquely Sikh.
* **C: khelf ts3 mu3llemyn b3d mu2eses aldyen, Guru Nanak** (Three teachers followed the founder of the religion, Guru Nanak) - The passage says ""tes3at mu3allimin 2a5arin"" (ten teachers followed) not three.
* **D: b3d teqaleyd alesyekheyh metjedrh fi alhendewseyh** (Some Sikh traditions are rooted in Hinduism) - The passage states Sikhs *recognize* their roots in Hinduism, but emphasizes their belief in it as a *separate* religion.

This translates to: ""The spiritual guide represents one of the fundamental aspects of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism, it acquired an importance that forms the essence of Sikh beliefs.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: al-taqalid al-Hendoseyya (Hindu traditions):** While the text acknowledges Sikhism *acknowledges* Hindu roots, it doesn't position these traditions as a *core* component of the belief system. They are recognized, but Sikhism is presented as distinct.
* **C: refd ala3teraf bi al deyanat al hindeyya alakhera (rejection of recognition of other Indian religions):** The text doesn't indicate rejection; it states acknowledgment of roots.
* **D: alethedth balelghh al-Punjabia (speaking in the Punjabi language):** While the term ""Gurmat"" is Punjabi, the *language* itself isn't presented as a core belief. It's the *meaning* of the term that's relevant (""the way of the teacher"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: all3eb (games):** The passage says they *can* focus on things they enjoy, like games.
* **C: meshahedh alersewm almut7reka (watching cartoons):**  Similar to games, they can focus on enjoyable activities like cartoons.
* **D: alasheya2 alty yestemt3wn baleqyam bha (things they enjoy doing):** This is a general statement that is true *because* they struggle with things they don't enjoy.  The passage specifically highlights schoolwork as the difficulty.

This translates to: ""These children tend to be noticeable in many problems because they ""engage in following risky behaviors, argue, and challenge authority"" in order to stimulate their awareness, as it cannot be stimulated by normal methods.""

Therefore, they engage in these behaviors *to stimulate their brains* because they have difficulty being stimulated in conventional ways.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: letqelyel fert alenshat** (to reduce hyperactivity) - The passage states they have difficulty focusing, not that they are trying to *reduce* hyperactivity.
*   **B: lemsa'edethem 3la aletwasel ma3 alaqeran** (to help them communicate with peers) - The passage actually states their behavior *hinders* relationships with peers.
*   **C: lejdeb anetbah waledyhem** (to attract their parents' attention) - While attention-seeking *could* be a factor, the passage explicitly states the reason is to stimulate their brains.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""When people do not see that the American deer are large and potentially dangerous, they may approach them too closely and expose themselves to danger.""

This directly translates to avoiding getting too close to deer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: tjahl wjwdhm (ignoring their presence):** The passage doesn't say to ignore deer, but to *recognize* they can be dangerous.
* **C: altqlyl ela adna hd mn mstwa althdyd almhtml (reducing to the lowest level of potential threat):** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: mraqbthm mn msafh b3eydh (observing them from a distance):** While observing from a distance is *good practice*, the passage focuses on the *negative* action to avoid – getting too close.  The key problem is the proximity, not simply observing.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with the passage:

* **B: la yunzr elyha ahyanaan 3la anha thdyd mhtml (they are sometimes not seen as a potential threat):** The passage says people don't realize they *can* be dangerous, leading them to get too close.
* **C: ymkn an tghdb mn wjwd ashkhas 3la mqrbh mnha (they can be bothered by people being close to them):**  The passage explains they will defend themselves if they feel threatened.
* **D: swf ydaf'ewn 3n anfshm eda lzm alamr (they will defend themselves if necessary):**  The passage clearly states they defend themselves if they perceive a danger.

Therefore, option A directly contradicts the information given in the passage.

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Qad yakun dhalika khatiran idha sa3a al-musafir wara2 as-sarab, wa ehdar a66aqa al-thamina, wal miyah al-mutabqqiya."" (That could be dangerous if the traveler pursues the mirage, and loses precious supplies, and remaining water.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: nqs almlabs aldaf'eh fi lylh bardh** (lack of warm clothes in a cold night) - While the passage *mentions* cold nights and hypothermia, it doesn't say this is the primary danger. It says hypothermia happens *because* of a lack of warm clothes, not that it's the main risk.
* **B: r'eyh srab y'ety whm alma'** (seeing a mirage causes confusion) - The passage states the mirage *appears* to be water, but the danger isn't the confusion itself, but chasing after it.
* **D: ehdar alma' athna' als'ey wra' alsrab** (losing water while pursuing the mirage) - The passage mentions losing water *along with* other supplies. Option C is more comprehensive.



Therefore, the most direct and accurate danger described in the passage is losing supplies (including water) while chasing the mirage."

    * **Ankhfad darajat hararat al-jism (hypothermia):** It mentions even hot deserts get cold at night and hypothermia is a real risk without warm clothes.
    * **Naqs al-ma' (lack of water):** The passage directly mentions wasting precious water chasing mirages.

* **The passage *does not* mention:**
    * **Harwq al-shams (sunburn):** While implied as a desert hazard, the passage focuses on mirages, cold nights, and water conservation, not direct sun exposure.

Therefore, **hrwq alshms** is the threat *not* mentioned in the text."

The passage details how the Spanish killed around 100,000 Taínos between 1492 and 1498. This clearly indicates the Taíno population was greatly affected after the arrival of the explorers.

This directly identifies Arawakan as the language of the Caribbean people mentioned in the text. While Spanish is now the official language of the Dominican Republic (mentioned as ""bil-espaniya""), the question asks about the language of the *original* Caribbean people as described in the passage.

* **A: eqamh tqws alkhswbh (performing the liturgy of the wood)** - Not mentioned.
* **B: eqd slah fi al'eshyh ywm alsbt (holding prayers in the evening on Saturday)** - While likely part of Easter celebrations, it isn't presented as a *special* or *distinctive* practice of traditional churches in the passage.
* **C: eqamh hflh rby'eyh llr'eyh (holding a spring festival for the shepherd)** - This refers to pre-Christian roots, which the passage mentions *might* be part of the origin, but isn't how it's currently celebrated.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...you might direct luxury branded perfumes available in these regions facing two problems; some of them may be counterfeit, and the genuine imported products may be more expensive with us.""  This directly points to fragrances being more costly in a foreign country.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: f7ws al3eyn (eye exams):** The passage suggests getting eye exams *done* in a foreign country to save money due to lower labor costs.
* **C: t2amyn alr2ueh (vision insurance):**  The passage doesn't discuss the cost of vision insurance.
* **D: etarat lyst dat asma2 tjaryh (fragrances without brand names):** The passage specifically addresses branded fragrances, not those without names.



"

Here's why:

The passage directly states: ""قد يكون بعضها مزيفاً"" which translates to ""Some of them might be counterfeit.""  This is a key concern when dealing with luxury goods in areas with lower income and potentially less regulation.

Let's look at why the other options are less direct or less emphasized in the passage:

* **A: qd tkwn hnak hajh ela fhs edafi ll'eyn (there might be a need for additional eye exams):** While the passage mentions getting an eye exam, it's presented as a *solution* to potential issues with getting prescriptions filled abroad, not a risk of *buying* the contacts themselves.
* **B: qd la tkwn alwsfh salhh letarat m3ynh (the prescription might not be valid for certain contacts):**  This is a potential issue, but not the primary risk highlighted. The prescription being valid elsewhere is discussed as something you *ensure* happens.
* **D: qd la yghty altamyn altklfh (the insurance might not cover the cost):**  This is about insurance coverage and isn’t directly addressed as a risk of the products themselves.



Therefore, the passage's main concern regarding buying contacts in a foreign country (especially a low-income one) is the possibility of receiving counterfeit products."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: tuqbl btaqat ala'etman waljnyh alestrlyny fqt fi aljzr alna'eyh** (Credit cards and the British pound are only accepted in the remote islands) - This is incorrect. Credit cards are accepted *from* Stanley, and the British pound is accepted *generally* throughout the islands.

The passage states that temple festivals celebrate:

*   The annual commemoration of the temple
*   The birthday of the deity
*   Any other major event related to the temple.

The birth of an elephant doesn't fit any of those categories. It's an external event, not intrinsically linked to the temple's religious or historical significance.

Therefore, **wladh fyl** is the event *not* related to temple festival celebrations."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: fi kl mkan min nihayat November wa 7atta muntasaf Mayo** (everywhere from the end of November to mid-May) - While the festivals happen during this time, it doesn't mean the elephants are *everywhere*.
* **B: fy alma3bad** (in the temple) - Elephants are part of the processions *around* the temple, not usually *inside* it.
* **D: fi shware3 wlayh kyrala** (in the streets of Kerala state) - While the processions travel through the streets, the elephants are specifically part of the *processions* themselves, not just randomly in the streets.

This translates to: ""The clear way to travel in first or business class is to pay money for the privilege (or better yet, have your company do it for you).""

The passage explicitly suggests having your company pay as a way to obtain these higher classes of travel. The other options are directly refuted by the text:

This translates to ""Don't forget to add the extra costs for extra visas, departure taxes, and land transportation, and so on for all those places outside of Africa.""

The question asks what *shouldn't* be forgotten when comparing total costs.  The cost of extra visas for places *outside* of Africa is explicitly mentioned as an important addition when comparing costs to global travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: tklfh dra'eb almghadrh fi afryqya** (the cost of departure taxes in Africa) - While departure taxes are mentioned, the passage emphasizes considering them *for places outside Africa* in the comparison.
* **C: tklfh altashyrh alafryqyh** (the cost of African visas) - The passage is comparing travel *to* Africa with travel around the world. African visa costs are less relevant for the comparison as they would likely be part of both scenarios.
* **D: tklfh alnql albry llmwaq'e kharj afryqya** (the cost of land transportation to places outside of Africa) - Land transportation costs are also mentioned as needing to be considered for places outside Africa, but the visa cost is a more specific and crucial point for a global comparison.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Fi ba3dh al-buldan aw anwa3 al-matajir, yujad mat3am wa7id 3ala al-aqal dakhil al-munsha2a, wa ghaliban ma yakunu mat3aman ghayr rasmy ila 7addin ma wa bi-as3ar ma3qula."" (In some countries or types of stores, there is at least one restaurant within the establishment, often somewhat informal and at reasonable prices.)

This directly addresses ways supermarkets provide convenience to customers buying prepared food – having a place to eat *at* the store.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: akhtyar aql tnw3eaan (fewer choices):** The passage states the opposite - larger stores have *more* variety.
*   **C: alt3am alny2 (raw food):** The passage is specifically about *prepared* food.
*   **D: frn maykrwwyf (microwave oven):** While the passage mentions some stores provide microwaves, this is presented as a solution to *heating* the prepared food, not a convenience the supermarket itself *offers*. It’s something the customer utilizes, not a service provided *by* the store.

ay mma yly qd la yfhmh al-Baljikiyyion wal Swisriyyion alnatqwn be al-Fransiya?,"The correct answer is **A: nidham attarqim al-Faransy al-qiyasi** (the standard French numbering system).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the numbering systems in Belgium and Switzerland differ from the standard French system. While Belgians and Swiss French speakers learn standard French in school and can generally understand it, the passage implies they *might* not immediately understand if you use the standard French numbering system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: klmat Fransiya ghrybh** (strange French words): The passage states there's *enough* similarity for understanding, suggesting unfamiliar words aren't a major issue.
* **C: ntq b3d alklmat al-Fransiya** (pronunciation of some French words): The passage mentions slight pronunciation differences, but these are considered minor and don't prevent understanding.
* **D: m3zm al-Fransiya almhkyh fi Fransa** (content of spoken French in France): The passage emphasizes understanding is generally possible despite variations, meaning the *content* isn't the problem.

The passage explicitly states: ""Wa 3ala wajeh al-khsus, fa enna jami3 al-Baljikiyyin wal Swisriyyin al-natiqin bil Faransiyya sa-yata3allamun al-Fransiyya al-qiyasiyya fil madaris..."" (And specifically, all Belgian and Swiss French speakers will learn standard French in schools...).  This means despite regional differences, they *all* learn the same standard French.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ntq kl alklmat** (pronunciation of all words) - The passage mentions slight differences in pronunciation.
* **B: nzam altrqym** (numbering system) - The passage specifically states the numbering system differs in Belgium and Switzerland.
* **D: thj'eh b3d alklmat alfrnsyh** (spelling of some French words) - The passage also mentions some words are spelled differently.

Here's why:

The passage states that to get the bereavement fares, you *must* book directly with the airline by phone. Options A, C, and D mention specific airlines, but don't relate to *how* you book. Option B directly addresses the method of booking - booking directly with the airline – which is the key requirement for these fares.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""في جميع الحالات، يجب أن تحجز عبر الهاتف مباشرة مع شركة الطيران."" (In all cases, you must book directly with the airline via phone.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: yghty tklfh alsfr ela aljnazh** (It reduces the cost of travel to the funeral) - While the passage mentions reducing costs, it doesn't say that's *the* main point.
* **B: yjb hjzh mbashrh 3la mwq'e shrkh altyran** (You must book directly on the airline's website) - The passage *specifically* says to book by *phone*, not online.
* **C: yghty tklfh alsfr fi allhzh alakhyrh** (It reduces the cost of travel at the last minute) -  This is true, but it’s a detail *about* how the airlines help, not the main point of what the passage is *about*.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...Idha lam yakun ladayka ittisal bayanat fi hatifik, aw 3indama yakun kharij nitaq attaghtiya, fa qad yakun ada2uhu ma7dud aw ghayr muta7."" (If you do not have a data connection on your phone, or when it is outside of coverage, its usefulness may be limited or non-existent.)

This directly implies that a standalone GPS device is *more* reliable when you *can't* rely on a data connection.  The phone app *requires* a data connection to function properly in many cases.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 3ndma thawl twfyr almal (When you want to save money):** The passage suggests apps are *cheaper* than buying a dedicated GPS device.
* **C: 3ndma tkwn kharj alntaq (When you are outside the coverage area):**  While true that the app is limited outside coverage, the passage implies a standalone GPS is *better* in that situation, not that using the app is preferable.
* **D: 3ndma la trghb fi ast'ejar jhaz (When you don't want to rent a device):** This is irrelevant to the comparison between an app and a dedicated GPS device.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Min al mumkin tawfir al mal li shira2 5ara2et jadida li nidham GPS, aw jihaz GPS aw isti2jar wa7id min sharikat ta2jir assayarat.""  This translates to ""You can save money on buying a new GPS map, a GPS device, or renting one from a car rental company.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: la da'ey llqlq bshan atsal albyanat (no need to worry about data connection):** The passage *acknowledges* that a data connection is needed and that the app may be limited or unusable without it. This isn't a *reason* to use the app, but a limitation.
* **C: tjnb aleyjar (avoiding rental):**  While avoiding rental is a *result* of using the app, it's not the primary reason *to* use it.
* **D: la thtaj ela shira2 khra'et jdydh (no need to buy new maps):**  Again, this is a *result* of using the app, not the fundamental reason.

The passage explicitly states: ""**Ta2akkad min 2anna al-wakil alladhy ta7jiz min khilalih mutakhassis fi juzur Galapagos wa ladayhi ma3rifa jayida bi majmu3a mutanawi3a mina assufun.**"" (Make sure that the agent you book through is specialized in the Galapagos Islands and has good knowledge of a diverse range of ships.)  This agent will then match you with a suitable ship based on your interests and limitations.

Let's look at why the other options are less direct or complete:

* **A: alhjz fi mjmw'eh ttkwn mn akthr mn 8 rkab ldyhm ahtmamat mmathlh** (Booking in a group of more than 8 people with similar interests) - While this *could* help, it's not the primary recommendation in the text.
* **B: alhjz khlal almwsm ghyr almzdhm** (Booking during the off-season) - This is mentioned as a way to *increase your chances* of getting a spot, but doesn't guarantee a suitable ship.
* **D: alhjz mqadamaan bkthyr** (Booking far in advance) - Similar to B, this increases your chances but doesn't guarantee the *right* ship for you.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ay mma yly la ystkhdm ktktyk lebqa' aldywf yqamrwn?","The correct answer is **C: mshrwbat mjanyh (free drinks)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tuqaddimu ba3dh al-amakin al-mashrubat al-ku7uliya fil manzil...li-ibqa2 adhuyuf fi 7ala mina al-mara7..."" (Some places offer alcoholic beverages on the premises...to keep the guests in a state of enjoyment). This directly links free drinks to keeping guests on the premises.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: wfrh aldw' altby'ey (abundance of luxury):** While the passage mentions luxurious food and entertainment, it doesn't specifically say *abundance* is the key to keeping guests around.
* **B: hwafz mthl tdakr alhflat almwsyqyh almjanyh (incentives like free music parties):** The passage mentions entertainment generally, but not specifically free music parties as the primary tactic.
* **D: ghyab alsa'eat (absence of clocks):** The passage mentions clocks being absent (""wa ssa3at gha2iba""), but frames it as a difficulty in tracking expenses, *not* as a strategy to keep guests from leaving.



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma aldy yjb 3la almqamr aldky tjnbh?","The correct answer is **A: shrb alkthyr mn alkhwl (drinking too much alcohol)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...wa ma3a dhalik, fa 2inna assukr yudh3if qudrat attamyiz, wa jami3 al-muqamirin al-akiffa2 ya3rifuna ahammiyat 2an tabqa mutayaqqidhan.""  This translates to ""...and with that, intoxication weakens the ability to discern, and all experienced patrons know the importance of staying vigilant.""

The passage warns about the dangers of being intoxicated and losing your ability to think clearly, directly linking it to alcohol consumption.  The question asks what a guest should avoid, and drinking too much alcohol fits this warning perfectly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: qbwl ay hwafz (accepting any gifts):** The passage doesn't mention gifts.
* **C: tfqd alwqt aw alsa'eat (losing track of time or hours):** While the passage mentions time can become distorted (""annawafidh wa ssa3at gha2iba""), it doesn't advise *avoiding* this, but rather acknowledges it happens.  The core warning is about staying safe.
* **D: alastfsar 3n aqrb mkhrj (asking about the nearest exit):** Knowing the exit is a *good* thing, not something to avoid. The passage even highlights it can be difficult to find exits.



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ay jz' mn alklam ytm ktabh awl hrf mnh bhrf kbyr fi mntsf aljmlh?","The correct answer is **B: alasma2 (the nouns)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Da2iman ma tabda2o jami3 al asma2, janban ila janb ma3a kalimat Sie, bi 7arfin kabir, 7atta law kanat fi muntasaf al-jumla.""  This translates to: ""Always start all nouns with a capital letter, side by side with the word Sie, even if they are in the middle of the sentence.""

Therefore, the passage clearly indicates that nouns are always capitalized, even mid-sentence.



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma aldy ymkn an tj'elh ktabh awl hrf mn alasma2 akthr s3ewbh?","The correct answer is **C: alktabh (the writing)**.

This translates to ""...while writing is complicated to a certain extent because of the need to know whether the verb or adjective is used in a passive form in the sentence.""

The passage directly links capitalizing all nouns to *making writing more complex*.  The other options are benefits *of* this capitalization rule (making reading easier, distinguishing between verbs and objects, distinguishing between nouns), but not what makes it *difficult*.

"""fi almnatq alryfyh mn Malaysia, ay lfth t3ny """"t3al""""?""","The correct answer is **A: thny alsbabh (bending the finger)**.

This translates to: ""And in Malaysia, at least among the Malays in rural areas, this means 'come', like bending the finger towards the body...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: altlwy7 (waving):** The passage discusses waving generally as a greeting (""Mar7aban"") but specifies the *Malaysian rural* meaning is different.
* **C: almsafhh alhwa2eyh (awkward shaking):** This isn't mentioned in the text regarding Malaysia. It describes a British tourist mistake in Spain.
* **D: rf3 alebham lla3la (thumb up):** This isn't mentioned at all in the passage.

"""wfqaan llfa8arh, ma hy alesharh alty qd t3ny """"3ud""""?""","The correct answer is **C: altlwyh m3 rahh alyd batjah alkharj** (waving the palm of the hand outwards).

Here's why:

The text states that in Malaysia, waving can mean ""come"" (similar to beckoning with a bent finger), and in Spain, British tourists might make a mistake by waving with their palm facing *themselves* (instead of outwards to the person they are waving to) which is a signal for ""return"" (""عود"" - 'ud in the question). Therefore, waving with the palm facing outwards is the explanation for the signal for ""return"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: altlwyh m3 rahh alyd batjah aldakhl** (waving the palm of the hand inwards) - This is the *incorrect* way to wave in Spain, which signals ""return"".
*   **B: thny sbabh** (bending the finger) - This is mentioned as similar to beckoning, but doesn't explain the ""return"" signal.
*   **D: aleyma' balras** (playing with the wrist) - This isn't mentioned in the text.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma aldy ysbb alshqwq?","The correct answer is **B: anhar jlydyh ghyr mstqrh (unstable glacial rivers)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states that glacial rivers (""al-anhar al-jalidiyya"") are *not* stable (""laysat thabita"") and *flow downwards* (""tatdaffaq na7wa asfal al-jabal""). This instability *causes* cracks and fissures (""tashaquqat, wa shuquq"").  The rest of the passage describes the consequences of this unstable river flow - collapses, fissures, and falling rocks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: jswr thljyh (ice bridges):** While the passage mentions glacial rivers, it doesn't state ice bridges *cause* the cracks. They are potentially *covered* by them, but aren't the root cause.
*   **C: khwf jlyda mnharh (glacial fear of rivers):** This is nonsensical and not found in the text.
*   **D: ktl fdfadh (falling masses):** Falling masses are a *result* of the cracks and unstable rivers, not the cause.

The passage states: ""...and that may lead to the occurrence of *tashaquqat* (cracks/fissures), and *shuquq* (cracks) may be hidden by ice bridges (*jusur al-jalid*).""

The question asks what can be hidden by ice bridges. The passage *directly* states that cracks/fissures can be hidden by them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: alkhwf aljlydyh (The glacial caves):** The passage mentions caves collapsing, but doesn't say ice bridges hide them.
* **C: aljdran (The walls):** The passage mentions cave walls collapsing, but doesn't say they're hidden by ice bridges.
* **D: ktl kbyrh (Large masses/blocks):** The passage says large blocks break off, but not that ice bridges hide them.

Here's why:

The text states that Goma was damaged by lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano in 2002. It *also* says that Goma is a base for *climbing* Nyiragongo.  This implies the volcano itself is a potential hazard and requires extra precautions.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **B: المنطقة المحيطة بـ Goma (The area surrounding Goma):** While the text mentions conflict in North Kivu, it doesn't specifically highlight the *area around* Goma as needing extra precautions. It suggests going *outside* Goma to understand the conflict.
* **C: وسط المدينة (The city center):** The text notes the city center was damaged, but this is past damage. It doesn’t indicate current danger specifically in the center.
* **D: رواندا (Rwanda):** Rwanda is mentioned geographically, but not as a place requiring extra precautions for travelers *related to the information about Goma*.

( ""...you must seek visits outside of Goma to understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu."") This directly implies that the situation in North Kivu is unstable and a concern for travelers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: enha mkan jyd lttb'e alghwryla aljblyh bas'ear m3qwlh** (It's a good place to follow mountain gorillas at a reasonable price): The text *does* mention Goma being a base for gorilla trekking, but doesn't warn against it.
* **C: t'etbr aldrajat alnaryh alty t'eml ktaksy tryqh jydh lltjwl** (Motorcycles that work as taxis are a good way to get around): The text *mentions* boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) as a way to get around, and even gives a price, implying they are a common and accepted mode of transport.
* **D: tq'e qa'edh brkan nyraghwnghw fi almdynh** (The base of Nyiragongo volcano is in the city): The text states Goma is a *base for climbing* Nyiragongo, not that the volcano's base is *within* the city.  It also details past damage from the volcano, highlighting potential risks.



Therefore, understanding the ongoing conflict in North Kivu is the most important piece of information a traveler should be aware of when considering a visit to Goma."

* **The passage states:** ""Taqtasir attsari7 3ala 7imayat al-wady, wa takunu muta7a fil yawm al-awwal min ashahr, arba3at ashhur qabla shahr al-bidaya."" (Permits are required to protect the canyon, and are available on the first day of the month, four months before the start month.)  This clearly indicates you *need to apply* for a permit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: nzam tsaryh mqadamh basbqyh altqdym** (A permit system submitted with prior application) - While true, it doesn't describe *what* the system is for - protection of the canyon.
* **B: altsaryh mtahh fqt fi 1 ynayr** (Permits are only available on January 1st) - This is partially true, but it's about *when* applications become valid, not the whole system.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Shakkalat hadhihi al-fanadiq al-makan allathy qad yuqimu fih al-mashahir..."" (These hotels formed the place where celebrities would reside...). This directly indicates that meeting famous guests was a characteristic of these hotels.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: bar kwktyl (cocktail bar):** While the passage mentions ""saharāt ra'i3a"" (wonderful evenings), it doesn't specifically mention cocktail bars. The evenings could involve various forms of entertainment.
* **B: mt'em fakhrh fi almwq'e (pride in the location):** The passage focuses on the *style* and *history* of the hotels, not necessarily their location.
* **D: ghrf tm tjdydha m3khraan m3 trqyat hdythh (rooms recently renovated with modern furnishings):** The passage *contrasts* these hotels with modern amenities.  It emphasizes their ""mustalzamat dhat attiraz al-qadim"" (old-fashioned facilities) and lack of modern entertainment.  They were known for *not* being modern.

Here's why:

The passage states that these hotels were characterized by ""**nuqs a7dath wasa2il attarfih**"" (a lack of modern means of entertainment). This directly contradicts the idea of good evening entertainment. The passage emphasizes their *old-fashioned* nature and lack of modern amenities.

Let's look at why the other options are likely:

* **A: almfrwshat al'etyqh fi jmy'e anha' al'eqar (old-fashioned furnishings throughout the property)** - The passage implies these hotels *would* have old-fashioned furnishings – it's part of their character and ""tiraz al-qadim"" (old style).
* **B: mt'em m3 tahen mtmyz (a distinguished chef)** -  The passage mentions they ""ghaliban ma kanat tuqaddimu ta3aman shahiyan"" (often offered delicious food), suggesting a good kitchen.
* **D: as3ear m3qwlh llghrf (reasonable room prices)** - While not explicitly stated, the passage doesn’t suggest prices would be a barrier.  The target clientele included wealthy travelers and heads of state.



Therefore, **poor evening entertainment** is the one thing least likely to be found in these hotels, given the description in the passage."

(Despite the fact that the word ""Eskimo"" remains acceptable in the United States, it is considered derogatory by many Arctic peoples who are not American, especially in Canada. While you may hear the words used by the native inhabitants of Greenland, foreigners should avoid using them.)

(Rubbama yakunu attaqs al-bared howa al-khatar al-7aqiqi al-wa7id alladhy sayuwajihuh ghayr al-musta3idin.) which translates to ""Perhaps the cold weather is the only real danger that unprepared travelers will face.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: b3ewd alshmal (mosquitoes)** - The passage mentions mosquitoes as a nuisance in the summer, but not as a major problem for *unprepared* travelers.
*   **B: aljrymh (crime)** - The passage explicitly states that crime is ""virtually unknown"" in Greenland.

This refers to the *garden* being the central square.

(Families with young children may need more preparation, but it is easy to spend a day outdoors even with toddlers and preschool-aged children.)  This *contradicts* the statement in option D.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate based on the passage:

* **A: hnak hajh ela alqlyl mn althdyr llmshy lmsafat twylh 3la almsarat alshlh** (There is a little preparation needed for long-distance walking on easy trails) - The text says ""Lil-qiyam bi nuzha li yawm wa7id 3ala tul darbin sahl, yajibu al-qiyam bi-ba3dh al-isti3dadat"" (To take a day trip on an easy trail, some preparation is required).
* **B: tkhtlf almsafat, wlkn mn almftrd an ytm tghtytha fi ghdwn ywm wahd** (The distances vary, but are expected to be covered in a single day) - The text states ""...masafat atwal yumkin taghtiyatuha fi yawmin wa7id."" (...longer distances that can be covered in a single day.)
* **C: alashkhas aldyn ytmt'ewn bmstwa m3tdl mn allyaqh albdnyh qadrwn 'emwmaan 3la alastmta'e bhda alnshat** (People who enjoy a moderate level of physical fitness are perfectly able to enjoy this activity) - The text says ""yumkin li ayi shakhs dhi liyaqa mutawassita al-istimta3 biha."" (anyone with moderate fitness can enjoy it.)

"wfqaan llfa8arh, mta yttlb altnzh alywmy alhd aladna mn althdyr?","The correct answer is **C: 3ndma ydhb alatfal fi nzhh** (When children go on the hike).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Qad ta7taj al3a2ilat allaty ladayha atfal sighar ila mazid min al-isti3dadat, wa lakin min assahl qadha2 yawm fil hawa2 attalq 7atta ma3a al-atfal arrudha3 wal atfal fi sin ma qabl al-madrasa.""  This translates to: ""Families with young children may need more preparation, but it is easy to spend a day outdoors even with toddlers and preschoolers.""

This directly implies that a day hike requires extra consideration *when children are involved*.  The passage doesn't mention needing preparation based on the trail's difficulty (A & B) or altitude (D).

This translates to: ""In the regions of Rogaland and Agder, they are usually called """"hei"""" which means a sloping area free of trees, *generally covered in heather*.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: thtwy 3la ashjar** (contain trees) - The passage explicitly states these areas are *free of trees*.
* **B: la ywjd mdayq** (there are no valleys) - The passage is *about* valleys and plateaus, so this is incorrect.
* **C: alhdab fi alghalb mtsawyh** (the plateaus are mostly flat) - The passage describes them as sloping (""mustanqa3iyya"").

(These plateaus are often referred to as ""vidde"" which means a wide, open area without trees, and an area with no limits.)
* This directly translates to the concept of open land areas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: الحداب المغطاة بالغابات (alhdab almghtah balghabat - plateaus covered in forests):** The passage specifically states these areas are *without* trees (""bila ashjar"").
* **C: مدافق شديدة الانحدار (mdayq shdydh alanhdar - steep valleys):** While the passage mentions steep valleys *existing* in Norway, it's describing the plateaus (""vidde"" or ""hei"") as a defining characteristic, not the valleys themselves.
* **D: مستنقعات (mstnq'eat - swamps/marshes):** The passage doesn't mention swamps or marshes. It describes open, generally rocky plateaus.

This clearly indicates that the hill stations are visited for snow-related activities *during the winter*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: khlal mwsm aldrwh** (during the monsoon season): The passage mentions the monsoon season (""assayf al-Hindi"") but states it's *not* when people go for skiing.
* **C: khlal alsyf alhndy** (during the Indian summer):  Again, the passage contrasts the monsoon season with the winter skiing season.
* **D: khlal alrby'e** (during the spring): The passage mentions a ""different kind of beauty"" in spring, but doesn't say people go for skiing then.

(And with that, they enjoy different kinds of beauty and charm during the winter season, where many hill stations receive significant amounts of snow and offer activities like skiing and snowboarding.)

This directly indicates that the largest number of tourists visit hill stations *during the snowfall season* (specifically winter) to enjoy snow-related activities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: twal mwsm altzlj 3la aljlyd (during the snowboarding season):** While snowboarding brings tourists, it's a *part* of the winter season, not the peak time for the largest number of tourists.
* **C: khlal alsyf alhndy (during the Indian summer):** The passage mentions the summer is *hot* and not ideal, the opposite of peak tourist season.
* **D: twal ashhr alshta' (throughout the winter months):** While winter is the season, the passage highlights *snowfall* as the main draw.  The peak is when the snow is heaviest.

mada yjb an ttjnb alqyam bh eda knt taml fi al'ethwr 3la qarb ybhth 3n almsa'edh?,"The correct answer is **B: msadqh alqbatnh (believing the captain)**.

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

The text describes a scenario where you are pretending to be a castaway seeking help. It emphasizes *gathering information* from other ""castaways"" (who are actually other participants), *observing* ships, and *trying to contact people on shore*.  

Believing the captain (msadqh alqbatnh) would contradict the core premise of the exercise, which is to assess and gather information, not to blindly trust. You're there to *evaluate* their responses and see if they offer assistance.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: almshy dhabaan weyabaan 3la alarsfh (walking back and forth on the dock):**  While potentially a bit aimless, it isn't directly *wrong*. It could be part of appearing distressed.
* **C: ale3lan 3n khdmatk (advertising your services):** This doesn't fit the scenario of being a castaway needing help.
* **D: tjahl alzmla' almtnzhyn 3la mtn alqwarb (ignoring fellow ""castaways"" on the boats):** The text *specifically* says you should ""share their information with you"" and ""talk to as many people as possible."" Ignoring them would be counterproductive.



Therefore, **B** is the most appropriate thing to avoid when pretending to be searching for help. It's about maintaining your role as an evaluator, not a naive recipient."

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) specifically states:** ""...tatakhata a7wad assufun, wa taqtarib min al ashkhas al ladhin yunazifun yukhutahum..."" (You will examine boats, and approach the people who are cleaning their boats...).  This directly indicates the need to approach people *while* they are cleaning their boats.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: altwasl m3 albharh** (connecting with sailors) - While you *will* connect with sailors, the passage details *how* you do it - through approaching people cleaning boats. This isn't the initial action.
* **B: alabt'ead 3n aladwa'** (staying away from tools) - There's no mention of avoiding tools in the passage.
* **D: tjnb alzmla' almtnzhyn** (avoiding fellow tourists) - The passage states you *will* meet and share information with other tourists (""sayuqabil mutanazzihin akharin bil qawarib wa sayusharikuna ma3lumatihim ma3ak"").

The text states: ""Mu3dham amakin attatwir al-7adhary li-jazirat Hong Kong mughattat bi-aradhy mustasla7a 3ala tul ashati2 ashamaly."" (Most of the urban development areas of Hong Kong Island are covered by reclaimed land along the northern shores.)  and ""lidha idha kunta tab7athu 3an dalil 7awla al-madhy al-isti3mary lil-mantiqa, fa-hadha makan jayid li-bad2 muhimmatik."" (Therefore, if you are looking for evidence about the colonial history of the area, this is a good place to start your search.)

This directly links the northern shore to the colonial development and therefore the colonial history.

The passage states: ""Lil 7usul 3ala afdhal al-manadhir li-Hong Kong, ghadir al-jazira wa 2itajih na7wa wajihat Kowloon al-ba7riya al-muqabila.""  This translates to: ""To get the best views of Hong Kong, visit the island and head towards the opposite Kowloon waterfront.""

Therefore, the Kowloon waterfront is specifically mentioned as the place to go for the best views.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: myna' fyktwrya (Victoria Harbour):** While Victoria Harbour *reflects* the skyline, it's not the *location* from which to get the best views.
*   **B: Hong Kong nfsha (Hong Kong itself):** Too general. The passage specifies a particular area *within* Hong Kong.
*   **C: jzyrh Hong Kong (Hong Kong Island):** The passage says to *visit* the island, but then directs you *towards* Kowloon for the best views.

This translates to: ""After that, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety stirrups that allow the stirrup leather to fall from the saddle if the horse falls backwards.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: n'eal dyqh (tight soles):** While the text mentions tight-fitting soles on riding boots, this is a general safety precaution, not a feature *of the saddle* to prevent getting caught.
*   **C: rka'eb jldyh (leather stirrups):** This is just describing the material of the stirrups, not a safety feature.
*   **D: astqrar akbr (greater stability):**  The text says stirrups *provide* greater stability, but doesn't state this is how they prevent accidents.

The passage specifically states: ""أولاً، يرتدي معظم الدراجين أحذية الركوب بكعب ونعل أملس ضيق جداً."" (Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a very smooth sole). This is a safety precaution to *reduce* the risk of a rider's foot getting caught in the stirrup.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: n'el khshn wdyq (rough and tight):** The passage states the sole is *smooth* (أملس), not rough.
*   **B: jld (skin):** Skin isn't part of the equipment used for safety.
*   **D: n'el 'eryd (wide sole):** The passage states the sole is *narrow* (ضيق جداً), not wide.

(Hospitality exchange networks are the organization that connects travelers with local residents in the cities they will visit.) This directly indicates the networks provide places to stay with locals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: rhlat jwyh rkhysh** (cheap flights) - The passage mentions Casey Fenton *needed* a cheap trip, but the network itself doesn't *provide* cheap flights.
* **C: aljwlat alty yqadamha almrshdwn almhlywn** (tours provided by local guides) - The passage doesn't mention tours.
* **D: atsalat m3 msafryn akhryn yzwrwn nfs alwjhh** (connections with other travelers visiting the same destination) - While the passage mentions reviews from other travelers, the primary offering isn't connections *with* those travelers, but lodging.

This translates to: ""Then a list of available hosts is provided, either printed or online, *sometimes* with reviews and comments from other travelers.""

* The word ""a7yanan"" (sometimes) means references are *not* always provided, making option A incorrect.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the text:

* **B: qd tttlb b3d alshbkat thqqaan edafyaan mn almsafryn** (Some networks may require additional verification from travelers) -  The text states: ""bi-rraghm min 2anna ba3dh ashabakat tuqaddim aw tatatallab ta7qiqan idhafiyan."" (although some networks offer or require additional verification)
* **C: sytm tzwyd almsafryn bqa'emh balmdyfyn almtahyn fi mdynh alwjhh** (Travelers are provided with a list of available hosts in their destination city) -  The passage explicitly states this happens: ""Ta2assasa mawqi3 Couchsurfing...bi-ssukkan al-ma7aliyin fil mudun allaty sayazurunaha.""

* **D: ttwfr ahyanaan mraj'eat almdyfyn almhlyyn llmsafryn** (Reviews of local hosts are sometimes available to travelers) -  As mentioned before, the passage states reviews are available ""a7yanan"" (sometimes).

The passage states: ""...fa-ddayf annamudhaji howa dhalika alladhy yakunu fil 3ishrinat mina al3umr (so the typical guest is someone in their twenties).""  This directly answers the question about the most likely type of guest to be sharing a room.

* **B: dyf ysafr bmfrdh (a guest traveling alone):** The passage doesn't focus on whether guests travel alone or not.

This translates to: ""...and the sweet flavors preferred by the Javanese are black pepper, cardamom and **sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar)** and other various spice flavors.""

Here's why:

* **The passage states that VPNs offer higher bandwidth and better service quality than proxies.**  If a user only needs basic web browsing and isn't demanding significant bandwidth (e.g., just checking email or reading news), a proxy might be *sufficient*.  A VPN's extra bandwidth and quality aren't necessary in those cases.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: almstkhdm yryd e'eadh twjyh kl hrkh mrwr alentrnt (The user wants to redirect all internet traffic):** The passage *specifically* states that VPNs redirect *all* internet traffic, while proxies often only handle HTTP. If that's the goal, a VPN is clearly superior.
* **B: yhtm almstkhdm btjnb alrqabh waltjss qdr alemkan (The user is concerned about avoiding surveillance and spying worldwide):** The passage emphasizes VPNs' encryption as making them harder to spy on.  A proxy doesn't provide the same level of security.
* **C: yqwm almstkhdm fi almqam alawl be'eadh twjyh hrkh mrwr brwtwkwl nql alns alfa'eq (The user primarily needs to redirect traffic through various data transfer protocols):**  Again, the passage highlights that VPNs handle *all* protocols, while proxies are often limited.

* **The text explicitly states:** ""innaha tu3id tawjih kul tadaffuq al bayanat 3alal internet, wa laysa faqat brotokol http."" (It redirects all internet data traffic, and not just HTTP protocol). This means VPNs handle *all* traffic, while proxies are often limited to specific protocols like HTTP.

* **B: ytm ntq m3zm alklmat bnfs tryqh ktabtha** (Most words are pronounced the same way they are written.) - While the passage *starts* by saying this is generally true, it then immediately points out exceptions with 'c' and 'g'.
* **C: qd tkwn alklmat dat alhrfyn (c) w (g) s'ebh** (Words with the letters 'c' and 'g' may be difficult.) - The passage says you *should pay attention* to these letters, but doesn't say they are *difficult*.
* **D: ykhtlf ntq m3zm alklmat a'etmadaan 3la alhrf alswty altaly** (The pronunciation of most words differs depending on the following vowel.) - The passage only mentions this for 'c' and 'g', not *most* words.

ayun mn myzat Izmir altalyh nshat qbl al'esr alhdyth?,"The correct answer is **D: al asquf attaqlidiyya dhat al qarmid al a7mar** (the traditional roofs with red tiles).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...wa suq al qaren aththamen 3ashar, **wal masajid wal kana2is al qadima**, 3ala rughmi min anna al madina tatamatta3 bi jawwin min Orobba al mutawasitiyya akthar min Turkiya al taqlidiyya.""  This indicates the existence of old mosques and churches, and by extension, older architectural elements like traditional roofs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ashshaware3 al wasi3a** (wide streets) - The text says Izmir is *now* characterized by wide streets, implying they are a modern development.
*   **B: al mabani dhat al wajihat azzujajiyya** (buildings with glass facades) - These are clearly described as part of the modern, developed city.
*   **C: marakiz attasawwuq** (modern shopping centers) - Also explicitly stated as a modern feature.

This directly translates to ""...and the 13th-century bazaar, mosques, and old churches, despite the city enjoying a Mediterranean European atmosphere more than traditional Turkey.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: almdynh thyt bkhlyj kbyr** (The city is located in a large bay) - While the passage mentions a bay (""khalij dakhem""), it doesn't highlight it as a *defining* characteristic of Izmir today. It's a historical detail about the ancient city of Smyrna.
* **B: y'eks aljw turkia altqlydyh** (It reflects the atmosphere of traditional Turkey) - The passage specifically states the opposite: Izmir has a more Mediterranean European atmosphere *than* traditional Turkey.
* **D: ldyha thany akbr myna' fi turkia** (It has the second largest port in Turkey) - The passage mentions Izmir has the second largest *marfa2* (port) in Istanbul, not in Turkey.

klmh hanamy tshyr ela mshahdh mada?,"The correct answer is **A: azhar alkrz** (cherry blossoms).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tu3tabar mushahadat azhar al-karaz, al-ma3rufa bi ism hanami..."" which translates to ""Observing cherry blossoms, known as hanami...""  This directly links ""hanami"" to cherry blossoms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: alarstqratyh alyabanyh** (Japanese aristocracy) - While the passage mentions the aristocracy participating, ""hanami"" *is* the observation of blossoms, not the aristocracy itself.
* **C: azhar albrqwq** (peach blossoms) - The passage states peach blossoms were preferred in Assin, the origin of the concept, but ""hanami"" in Japan is about *cherry* blossoms.
* **D: alblat alembratwry** (the imperial court) - The imperial court *hosted* the events, but ""hanami"" is the activity itself, not the location.

This translates to: ""In Japan, the emperor hosted the first cherry blossom viewing for himself only and other members of the aristocratic class around the imperial court.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: embratwr alsyn** (the Chinese emperor) - The text mentions the origin of the practice being in China (Assin), but the *first* viewing in Japan was hosted by the Japanese emperor.
*   **B: alarstqratywn alyabanywn** (Japanese aristocrats) - While aristocrats were *included* in the first viewings, they didn't *host* them.
*   **D: alarstqratywn alsynywn** (Chinese aristocrats) - This is related to the origin, but not the specific event mentioned in the question.

The text specifically states: ""Nadharan lil-ahamiya addiniya lil-madina, wa la siyama al-mawaqi3 al-3adida fi mintaqat al-balda al-qadima, tu3addu al-quds wa7ida min al-wijhat assiya7iya arra2isiya fi isra2il.""  (Considering the religious importance of the city, and especially the numerous sites in the Old City area, Jerusalem is considered one of the main tourist destinations in Israel.)

This directly links the religious significance to attracting tourists.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: mkantha k'easmh lesra'eyl** (its status as the capital of Israel): The text acknowledges this is *contested* and not universally recognized, and doesn't frame it as a draw for tourism.
* **C: erwdha althqafyh** (cultural richness): While present, the text emphasizes religion *first* as a reason for tourism.
* **D: almwaq'e altarykhyh al'edydh** (numerous historical sites): This is true, but the text *connects* the tourism specifically to the *religious* historical sites.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    * **Altarykh almdhl (the long history):** It states the Old City has a history stretching back thousands of years.
    * **Alahmyh aldynyh (the religious importance):** It highlights the city's holiness to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and its role as a spiritual center.
    * **Almwaq'e althqafyh (the cultural sites):** It mentions historical, archaeological, and cultural sites, plus vibrant shopping and dining.

* **The passage *does not* directly address:** the *political influence* or the contested status of Jerusalem as a capital.  It acknowledges other nations don't recognize it as Israel's capital and refers to ""occupied Palestine,"" hinting at political complexities, but it doesn't *detail* the political influence itself.



Therefore, the only item not explicitly covered in the text is the political influence surrounding Jerusalem."

Here's why:

The text states that the Wild Card allows access to ""a selected group of parks in South Africa or *all* of the national parks in South Africa.""  If someone *only* visits Kruger, the cost of the Wild Card likely won't be worth it compared to just paying the daily entrance fee. The Wild Card's value comes from allowing access to *multiple* parks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** This traveler *would* benefit, as the Wild Card provides access to many SANParks.
*   **C:** This traveler *would* benefit, as the Wild Card could save them money on entrance fees if they visit enough parks.
*   **D:** This traveler *would* benefit, as the Wild Card covers multiple parks.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""إنها تمثل إحدى مناطق الجذب الرئيسية في جنوب إفريقيا"" (Indeed, it represents one of the main attraction areas in South Africa).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: tkhtlf alhyah albryh byn al'edyd mn almnatq alby'eyh fi alhdyqh** (Wildlife varies between many of the ecological regions in the park): While true, this is a *detail* about the park, not its overall size or importance.

*   **A: alzrwf alrtbh (the comfortable conditions)** - The passage describes a *difficult* climb, not comfortable conditions.
*   **B: alslalm alhjryh (the stone stairs)** - The stairs are *provided* to help with the climb; they aren't a source of danger.
*   **D: alkablat alfwladyh (the steel cables)** - The steel cables are a *safety feature* (a support/handrail) in the steepest parts.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""tuwaffiru al-kablat al-fulaziya fil ajza2 al-akthar in7idaran darabzin da3im"" (Steel cables provide a sturdy railing in the steepest parts). This directly contradicts option B.

Let's look at why the other options *are* reflected in the passage:

* **A: hta almtslqyn alla'eqyn ryadyaan mn almhtml an tnqt'e anfashm** (Even fit climbers may find themselves breathless) - The passage states: ""tawaqqa3 2alla tastati3a 2iltiqata anfasik"" (Expect that you may not be able to catch your breath).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: allhm (meats)** - While meat is mentioned, it's not presented as a foundational element like bread is.
*   **C: alhbwb (grains)** -  Bread *is* made from grains, but the text specifically highlights bread itself.

This directly describes how hangi cooking utilizes either fire-heated stones or geothermal heat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the passage mentions hangi is available in Wellington, it doesn't state it *specifically* uses hot stones.
* **C:** The passage says hangi often replaces traditional barbecues, but doesn't define that as its primary characteristic. It's a consequence, not the defining feature.
* **D:** The passage *does* state hangi is available in Rotorua, but this is a location, not a description of *how* it's cooked.



"

The passage explicitly mentions two methods for heating the *hangi* pit:

*   **Al-7arara al-jawfiya misa7a mina al-ardh sakhina bi-tabi3atiha** (Geothermal heat rising from the naturally hot earth) - This corresponds to option C.

The passage *does not* mention using gas to heat the *hangi* pit. Therefore, **ghaz (gas)** is the method *not* mentioned.

The text states men are required to wear pants that cover the knees. It also mentions that these pants can be *rented* from a store at the entrance, but are not washed after each use – implying they are a standard, readily available (and likely shorter) style.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: tnanyr (skirt):** The text specifically states women must wear skirts.
*   **C: srawyl (pants):** While pants *are* required, the text implies they are a specific type (covering the knees but potentially not long pants) due to the rental situation and hygiene concerns.

* **The passage also says:** ""...satatamakkan aydan min al-istimta3 bi-nnujum"" (you will also be able to enjoy the stars) because of the lack of light pollution and the polar night.
* **Why other options are wrong:**

    * **B: 3ndma la tkwn almntqh mahwlh balskan (when the area is uninhabited):** While true that less populated areas have less light pollution, the *key* factor for seeing more stars is the darkness of the polar night.

The passage explicitly states: ""يجب أن تكون في الهواء الطلق مع وجود خط رؤية واضح للقمر الصناعي لإجراء مكالمة هاتفية"" (You must be in the open air with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eda tm e'eaqh kht alr'eyh ela alqmr alsna'ey** (if the line of sight to the satellite is obstructed) - This is the *opposite* of what's needed.
* **B: eda kan almwq'e b'eydaan jdaan** (if the location is very remote) - While remote locations are where this technology is *useful*, it's not a condition preventing it from working if a signal *can* be achieved.

The text explicitly states: ""Moldova hiya jumhuriyya mutnawwi3at al 3irqiyya wa 3anat min sira3at 3irqiyya fil madi."" (Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic and suffered from ethnic conflicts in the past.)  It then directly links this conflict to the creation of Transnistria: ""Fi 3am 1994, adda hadha assira3 ela isha2 jumhuriyyat Transnistria..."" (In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the Transnistria republic...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: alaqtsad (the economy):** While economic ties *followed* the creation of Transnistria, the text doesn't say the economy *caused* it.
*   **C: allghh (language):** The text mentions language differences (Romanian vs. Russian) but doesn't state it was the primary *cause* of the split.
*   **D: aldyn (religion):** Religion is mentioned as a characteristic of Moldova, but not as a cause of the conflict or the formation of Transnistria.



"

The text explicitly states that Transnistria ""declared its independence and its official currencies but it has not been recognized by most countries in the United Nations."" This is the key difference highlighted in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: allghh (language):** The text states Russian is the most widespread language in Moldova, but doesn't say Transnistria *specifically* differs in language.
*   **B: aldyn (religion):** The text states Russian Orthodox Christianity is prevalent in Moldova, implying it's common across the country, not a difference specific to Transnistria.
*   **D: al3mla (currency):** While the text mentions Transnistria has its own currency, it also says economic ties have been *re-established* between Transnistria and the rest of Moldova, which implies some economic interaction still exists.  The fundamental difference is recognition of sovereignty.

(And considering that the city of Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer there is when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.)

The question asks when a traveler should visit Montevideo *to avoid* windy conditions. The passage describes Montevideo's winters (when the Northern Hemisphere is experiencing summer) as having cold winds and high humidity, making it *feel* colder than the temperature indicates. Therefore, visiting during the Northern Hemisphere's winter (Montevideo's summer) would mean experiencing the windiest conditions.  To *avoid* them, the traveler should go when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: khlal mwsm aljfaf fi Montevideo** (During the dry season in Montevideo): The passage states there *isn't* a distinct dry season.
* **C: khlal ashhr alsyf fi nsf alkrh alshmaly** (During the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere): This corresponds to Montevideo's winter, which the passage indicates is windy.

(Because the city of Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer there is when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa).

The question asks when a traveler should visit Montevideo if they prefer colder weather. Since Montevideo has summer when the Northern Hemisphere has winter, the coldest time to visit Montevideo is during the Northern Hemisphere's summer.

This directly links the current form of graffiti to being an *activity* or *act* of writing (fa3aliyat al-kitaba) and elevates it to an art form, distinguishing it from simple vandalism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: khrbshat (scribbles):** The passage specifically contrasts modern graffiti *from* unreadable scribbles.

* **A: aldhab fi wqt mtakhr mn allyl** (staying up late) - While the passage mentions music continuing late, it doesn't say this is what you need to do to camp near the music.
* **B: albqa' fi mntqh ll'ea3lat** (staying in the family area) - This is for families with small children, not for those wanting to be near the music.
* **C: altkhyym kharj almwq'e** (camping outside the site) - The passage focuses on camping *within* the festival grounds, specifically near the music.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ayn yjb 3la alzwar tjnb albhth 3n alhyah allylyh fi shmal New Mexico?","The correct answer is **B: hanat albldh alsghyrh (small town limits)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**7anat al-mudun assaghira huna laysat da2iman amakin jayida li-zza2ir min kharij al-wilaya li-ttasakku3 fiha.**"" (The limits of small towns here are not always good places for a visitor from out of state to stay in.)  It also warns about the high concentration of drunk drivers near the bars in these small towns due to issues with driving under the influence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pueblos:** The passage doesn't mention anything negative about Pueblos.
*   **C: almrakz altjaryh (commercial centers):**  The passage mentions casinos often *have* entertainment (with a commercial aspect), but doesn't suggest avoiding them.
*   **D: alkazynwhat (casinos):** The passage says casinos offer drinks and entertainment, but the warning is specifically about the *towns* they are in, not the casinos themselves.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ayn mn almrjh an yjd alza'er trfyhaan m3rwfaan fi shmal New Mexico?","The correct answer is **C: fi kazynw balqrb mn Sante Fe** (in a casino near Santa Fe).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...lan tatamakan min al-3uthur 3ala 7ayat layliya duna attawajuh ila Albuquerque aw Santa Fe."" (You won't find much nightlife unless you go to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.) and ""...al-3adid minha yajlib attarfih alladhy ya7mil 3alama tijariya (bi-shaklin asasy al-kazinuhat al-kabira allaty tu7it mubasharatan bi-Albuquerque wa Santa Fe)."" (Many of them offer commercial entertainment, primarily in the form of large casinos directly bordering Albuquerque and Santa Fe.)

This indicates that casinos near Santa Fe are the most likely place to find the kind of entertainment the traveler is looking for in northern New Mexico.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: fi kazynw yb3d sa'etyn 3n Albuquerque** (in a casino two hours from Albuquerque): The passage doesn't emphasize casinos *far* from the main cities, but those *near* them.
* **B: fi pueblo b'eyd** (in a pueblo): The text doesn't mention pueblos as entertainment hubs.
* **D: fi hanh bldh sghyrh** (in a small town): The passage *warns* against small towns being good places for out-of-state visitors to stay, due to safety concerns (drunk driving).

qd yrghb almsafrwn alwa'ewn balmyzanyh fi tjnb ay nw'e mn almshrwbat?,"The correct answer is **B: almyah alm3bah (bottled water)**.

This translates to: ""Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but effects can occur on bottled water if you are worried.""

This implies that travelers concerned about their budget (as indicated by ""wa'ewn balmyzanyh"" - conscious of their budget) would want to *avoid* bottled water because it's potentially problematic and unnecessary when tap water is safe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: alnbyd alastraly (Australian wine):** The text doesn't suggest anything negative about Australian wine, only that New Zealand and Australian drinks are exported well.
*   **C: alj'eh almhlyh (local beer):** The text discusses local beers (""Number One"" and ""Manta"") positively.
*   **D: esyr alfwakh (fruit juice):** The text states fruit juices are expensive but delicious - a cost issue, not a safety one.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""anwa3 al-mashrub al-newzilandy wal 2usturaly yumkin naqluhuma ila al-kharij bi-shaklin afdhal"" (New Zealand and Australian beverages can be exported in a better way).  This implies they are good choices for a customer. Sauvignon Blanc is a well-known New Zealand wine.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: alqhwh alsghyrh alswda'** (small black coffee): The passage mentions black coffee (""espresso"") but doesn't suggest a customer would *choose* it as a recommendation. It's more a description of what Australians prefer.
*   **B: rqm wahd** (Number One): This is the name of a local beer, not something a server would recommend.
*   **D: flat wayt** (flat white): The passage specifically says Australians find the ""flat white"" coffee strange (""ghariba 3anhum""). A server wouldn’t recommend something the locals don’t even like!

"astmrt ftrh alast'emar lthlathh qrwn, wbdat mn qbl ay mjmw'eh?","The correct answer is **D: alesban (the Spanish)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bada2a al-espan fatrat al-isti3mar allaty istamarrat li-na7w thalatht qurun."" This translates to: ""The Spanish began the colonial period which lasted for about three centuries.""

The question asks which group *began* the three-century colonial period.  Therefore, the answer is the Spanish.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Payaguá & Guaycurú:** These are indigenous groups who *were subjected to* colonization, not the colonizers themselves.
*   **Guaraní:** While the Guaraní were a significant indigenous group in the region, they were also affected by colonization, not the initiators of it.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma hy afdl tryqh lj'el albarysy yrtah lk?","The correct answer is **C: altsrf bthdyb** (behaving politely/with good manners).

This translates to: ""Although this matter is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to fit in in Paris is to behave with the best manners, i.e., as a 'well-raised' person.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mhawlh mhakah alslwk albarysy** (trying to imitate Parisian behavior) - While potentially helpful, the passage emphasizes *good manners* as the most effective approach, not imitation.
* **B: ezhar althqh balnfs** (showing self-confidence) -  Confidence isn't mentioned as a key to getting along with Parisians in the text.
* **D: ezhar slwk mnfth** (showing arrogant behavior) - The passage *implies* the opposite; it describes Parisians as potentially perceiving others as arrogant, and good manners are suggested to *avoid* that perception.



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ay mma yly la y'etbr sfh nmtyh llbarysyyn?","The passage states: ""Yashtahiru al Barsiyyun bi annahum ananiyyun, wa ghalidhum wa muta3ajrifun."" (The Parisians are known to be selfish, rude, and arrogant.) It then says this is often just a stereotypical, inaccurate image.

The question asks what is *not* considered a stereotype of Parisians according to the passage.

* **A: alghrwr (غرور) - Vanity/Conceit:** The passage *does* list arrogance (muta3ajrifun) which is closely related to vanity, so this *is* a stereotype.
* **B: alfzazh (فظاظة) - Rudeness:** The passage explicitly states they are known for being rude (ghalidhum), so this *is* a stereotype.
* **C: almrh (مرح) - Joyfulness/Cheerfulness:** The passage does *not* mention joyfulness. In fact, the described traits are quite the opposite.
* **D: almbaghth (مبغت) - Suddenness/Unexpectedness:** This is unrelated to personality traits and isn't mentioned in the text.

Therefore, the best answer is **C: almrh (مرح)** because the passage focuses on negative traits and doesn't portray Parisians as joyful or cheerful.  The passage describes them as selfish, rude, and arrogant – the opposite of joyful.

Here's why:

The text states: ""7afilat MetroPlus takunu da2iman fi nihayat al-qitar al-aqrab li Cape Town."" This directly translates to ""MetroPlus carriages are always at the end of the train closest to Cape Town,"" meaning they are at the front.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: edm wjwd alkthyr mn alnas** (less crowding) - While the text says Metroplus is more comfortable and less crowded, it doesn't define *that* as its benefit, it's a *result* of it being a higher class.
* **C: enha aql tklfh mn tdkrh aldrjh althalthh** (it is cheaper than the third class ticket) - The text says it's *more expensive* than the third class, though still cheaper than European metro tickets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: haflh mtrw aql azdhamaan** (Less crowded carriages) - While MetroPlus is *said* to be less crowded, it doesn't define what the train *has*.
* **B: nfs s'er altdkrh lkla alf'etyn** (The same ticket price for both classes) - The text explicitly states the prices are different (""tazid taklifatuha qalilan"").

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""...أو تنشر العدوى (or spread contagion/infection)..."" - meaning animals can transmit diseases.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: altsbb fi tfh jldy (causing skin rash):** While some animals *can* cause skin rashes, the passage doesn't specifically mention this. It focuses on broader issues like food spoilage, allergies, and serious diseases.
* **B: thyj alhsasyh (causing allergy):**  The passage mentions ""al-7sasiya"" (allergy) as a *worse case* scenario, but isn't the primary focus of the dangers presented.
* **D: altsbb besabat qwyh (causing severe injury):** The passage states dangerous animals that *can* cause severe injuries are usually *not* considered ""affat"" (pests), distinguishing them from the pests discussed.

Therefore, **spreading infection (nshr 'edwa)** is the most direct and accurately reflected danger of pests (affat) mentioned in the passage.

This means beech trees are specifically mentioned as being present, while oak (alzan), pine (albalut), and fir (altannub) are also listed. The question asks which tree is *least* common. Since beech is the only one *not* specifically mentioned, it's the most logical answer.

The passage states: ""في حقيقة الأمر، لا تتأثر رموز المناطق بـناسخ غير القانوني..."" (In reality, region codes are not affected by illegal copying...). This directly indicates that the issue the company is *actually* addressing with the region codes is illegal copying.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: nskh alqrs (piracy copying):** While related to illegal copying, the passage specifically mentions the codes aren't *affected* by it, making it not the core issue they're addressing.
* **B: mraqbh alswq (market monitoring):** The passage states the *real* goal is to control markets for profit, but the codes themselves aren't about monitoring, they're about preventing something.

The passage (P) explicitly states the company *claims* the reason for the restrictions on region codes is ""to avoid piracy"" (""li tajannubu al qarsana""). However, the passage argues this is a lie.  It then states the *real* goal is to maintain greater control over markets (""mane7 hadhihi ashsharikat haymantan akbar 3ala aswaqiha"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: enha drwryh lksb almzyd mn alsytrh 3la alswq (that it is necessary to gain more control over the market)** - While the passage *says* this is the real goal, the question asks what the company *claims*.

* **The passage (P) directly states:** ""مراقبة الجمارك قد تكون مصدر إزعاج"" (Customs monitoring may be a source of annoyance).  It's discussing the potential for customs checks to be a problem upon returning to your home country.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: فحص الهجرة (fahs alhijrah - Immigration check):** The passage mentions *attftish al khas bil hijra* (special immigration inspection) but frames it as potentially formal (""shakliyyan"") and not necessarily a source of annoyance.
* **B: الإعلان عن الأشياء (ale3lan 3n alashya' - Declaring items):**  The passage *mentions* declaring items (""e3lan 3n ya shay2""), but it's about knowing what *must* be declared and what is illegal.  It doesn't say the declaration itself is the problematic thing.
* **C: الحدود القانونية للأشياء (alhdwd alqanwnyh llashya' - Legal limits for items):**  Similar to B, the passage talks about understanding these limits, not the limits themselves being the issue.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: eda kant hnak nqth tftysh llhjrh** (If there's an inspection point for immigration) - While true, knowing *if* there's an inspection isn't as important as knowing *what's allowed* through the inspection.

This translates to ""No alliance covers all of the Pacific crossings (and SkyTeam doesn't cover any of them).""

* **C: khtwt latam aljwyh altab'eh lthalf 'ealm wahd (LATAM flights belonging to one alliance):** LATAM specifically operates the one gap in Star Alliance coverage (Santiago to Tahiti) and is part of Oneworld, meaning it doesn't represent minimal ocean crossings *overall*.

* **C: sdyqan ysafran m3aan (a friend traveling with you):** Traveling with one friend isn't enough to get the better group rate, according to the text.
* **D: mjmw'eh mn khmsh (a group of five):** While a group of five *could* get a good price, the passage specifically highlights forming a group starting with *three* as the initial step.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Laqad sa3ada taswiruha al-mutakarrir fil musiqa wal aflam wal 2adab wal thaqafa asha3biya fi ja3l al-madina wa ma3alimiha ma3rufa fi jami3 an7a2 al-3alam.""  This directly translates to ""Its repeated depiction in music, films, literature and popular culture has made the city and its landmarks known throughout the world.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: mrafq alm3tmrat dat aldrjh alawla (first-class conference facilities)** - While mentioned, this is a *result* of San Francisco's popularity, not the primary reason for its global recognition.
*   **C: altnw'e alaqtsady (economic diversity)** - The passage mentions economic diversity, but doesn't state it's the key to global recognition.
*   **D: mshhd t3am asywy sa'ed (thriving Asian food scene)** - Also mentioned, but it’s a feature *within* the city, not the main driver of its international fame.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ay mn aljml altalyh 7wl San Francisco ghyr sa7i7a?","The correct answer is **D: y'etmd alaqtsad balkaml 3la alsyahh (the economy relies completely on tourism)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Baynama yartabitu iqtisad San Francisco bi-kawniha mantiqa 3alamiya li-jadhb assuya7, ya3tamidu iqtisaduha 3ala masadir mutanawi3a"" - This translates to ""While San Francisco's economy is linked to being a global tourist attraction, its economy relies on *diverse* sources.""  It explicitly says it *doesn't* rely *completely* on tourism.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: ghalbaan ma 'eurdt fi alaflam walktb (often depicted in films and books):** The passage states, ""Laqad sa3ada taswiruha al-mutakarrir fil musiqa wal aflam wal 2adab wal thaqafa asha3biya fi ja3l al-madina wa ma3alimiha ma3rufa fi jami3 an7a2 al-3alam"" (Its frequent depiction in music, films, literature, and popular culture has made the city and its landmarks known throughout the world.)
* **B: almtbkh alasywy sa'ed (Asian cuisine is popular):** The passage states, ""Tu3addu San Francisco aydhan a7ad afdhal al-amakin fil balad bi nnisba lil ma2kulat al-asyawiya al-2ukhra: al-kuriya wal taylandiya wal hindiya wal yabaniya"" (San Francisco is also one of the best places in the country for other Asian cuisines: Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese.)
* **C: hnak al'edyd mn alfnadq wmrakz alm3tmrat (there are many hotels and conference centers):** The passage states, ""Tu3addu San Francisco aydhan aydhan binya ta7tiya siya7iya kabira bil idhafa ila al-3adid min al-fanadiq wal mata3im wa marafiq al-mu2tamarat min addaraja al-2ula"" (San Francisco also has a large tourism infrastructure in addition to many hotels, restaurants, and first-rate conference facilities.)



Therefore, **D** is the only statement that contradicts the information provided in the text."

The text states: ""Yumkinuhum kadhalika al-i7tifadh bil-7ajz min ajlik, wa dhalika idha kunta bi-7aga ila waqt li-ttafkir fil 3ardh, **aw shira2 mustanadat 2ukhra lil-intiqal ila wijhatik (atta2shira 3ala sabil al-mithal)**.""  

This translates to: ""They can also hold the reservation for you, especially if you need time to think about the offer, **or to obtain other documents for travel to your destination (like a visa, for example)**.""

This directly indicates that a traveler needing time to acquire a visa would benefit from using a travel agency's services because the agency can hold the reservation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: msafr ghyr hasm (a non-decisive traveler):** While the text mentions needing time to *think* about an offer, the visa example is a more concrete reason.
* **B: msafr 'erdh ll'efwyh (a traveler offering offers):** This is completely unrelated to the text.
* **D: msafr yfdl hjz sfqat albaqat (a traveler who prefers package deals):** The text *describes* what travel agencies offer (package deals), but doesn’t state this is the type of traveler who *needs* them.



"

Here's why:

The paragraph discusses booking flights and hotels *through* a travel agency. It mentions things the agency *does* (securing accommodation, offering packages, holding reservations). However, it **doesn't** mention needing to provide travel documents (like passports or visas) *to the agency* when booking.  While implied, it's not explicitly stated.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: sfqat alfnadq (Hotel deals):** The paragraph *explicitly* states travel agents often make deals with specific hotels.
* **C: albaqat alshamlh (Comprehensive packages):** The paragraph mentions packages including breakfast, transfers, and flights+hotels.
* **D: alahtfaz balhjz (Holding reservations):** The paragraph specifically mentions agencies can hold reservations for you.



Therefore, **A** is the only thing *not* directly mentioned as a function or benefit of booking through a travel agency in the given text."

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...illa annahu yajib ana tatawakhkha al 7adhar li2annah qad takun qad takun asabat al ma3na bi shaklin khata2.""  This translates to ""...but one must be cautious because it may have missed the meaning in a wrong way.""  

This clearly indicates that even the best translation apps *cannot* guarantee 100% accuracy. They can translate texts and even objects, but they are prone to errors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: trjmh allaftat ela lghat ajnbyh** (translating signs into foreign languages) - The passage specifically mentions apps can translate signs/objects in the real world.
*   **B: trjmh ajza' kamlh mn alnsws** (translating complete parts of texts) - The passage states these apps *are* capable of translating complete parts of texts.
*   **C: trjmh alns 3la alashya' 'ebr alhatf aldky** (translating texts on objects via smartphone) - This is a description of a feature the apps *have*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mhrkat altrjmh almuhsnh (the improved translation engine):** While the engine *enables* translation, it doesn't allow for offline use on its own.
* **B: alhwatf aldkyh (smartphones):** Smartphones are the *device* used, not what enables offline translation.

"
ay mma yly lys mhfzaan llanhyarat aljlydyh?,"The correct answer is **A: althlj allzj (the sticky snow)**.

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

The text specifically states: ""التتمثل المشكلة في أن الثلج يكون لزجًا، لذا يحتاج إلى بعيد المحفزات لصحبه..."" (The problem is that the snow is sticky, so it needs a lot of triggers to cause it to slide...).  This directly identifies sticky snow as a factor needing triggers for an avalanche to occur.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: albshr (humans):** While the text mentions ""أحداث طبيعية أخرى أو إنسانية"" (other natural or human events), it doesn't specifically highlight humans *as* a trigger. They can *cause* events that trigger avalanches, but aren't a direct trigger themselves.
* **C: ash'eh alshms (sunshine):** The text mentions sunshine can *cause* warming which *can* contribute to avalanches, but isn't the primary sticky factor.
* **D: alhtwl althljy aledafy (warm snowfall):** Again, this contributes to warming and can be a factor, but isn't the fundamental sticky quality described as needing triggers.

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Al mun7adarat shadidat al in7idar yumkin an tabqa bati2a lil ghaya, wa tankhafid al a7jam alza2ida 3ala shakl inhiyarat thaljiyya.""  This translates to ""Steep slopes can remain quite stable, and reduce excess accumulation in the form of avalanches.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: thlj lzj lm yuhfz** (sticky snow not preserved) - While the passage mentions sticky snow *contributes* to avalanches, it's not what *is* an avalanche.  It's a condition that makes them happen.
* **B: mnhdrat shdydh alanhdar bdwn thlj** (steep slopes without snow) - Avalanches, by definition, involve snow.
* **D: trk althlj dwn an ymsh albshr** (leaving snow without walking on it) - This is irrelevant to the formation of avalanches.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Al-kari 3ibara 3an tabaq ya3tamid 3ala **al-a3shab wa attawabil**..."" which translates to ""Curry is a dish that relies on **herbs and spices**...""

While the passage *also* mentions yogurt and coconut milk as ingredients used in different regions, the foundational element of curry, according to the text, is herbs and spices.



"
"fi mnatq m3ynh, ystkhdm hlyb jwz alhnd ahyanaan bdlaan mn ay mkwn fi alkary?","The correct answer is **A: allhm (the milk)**.

The passage states: ""...fi janub al-hind wa ba3dh al-manatiq assa7iliya al-2ukhra fi shibh al-qarra al-hindiya, yashi3u istikhdam 7alib jawz al-hind.""  This translates to ""...in southern India and some other coastal regions of the Indian subcontinent, the use of coconut milk is common.""

Therefore, coconut milk (حليب جوز الهند - *halib jawz al-hind*) is used in certain regions.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hiya laysat dhakiyya lil ghaya, lidha yajeb an ya2khud al masar in7irafan tawilan 7awla jibal Transantarctic lil wusul ila al hadaba.""  This translates to: ""It is not very smart, therefore the route must take a long detour around the Transantarctic Mountains to reach the plateau.""

The question asks *why* a long detour is needed. The passage directly answers this - because the sleds aren't ""smart"" enough to navigate a direct route.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ghalbaan ma ytm eghlaq mhth McMurdo** (McMurdo is often closed) - This isn't mentioned as a reason for the detour.
* **B: althlj almdghwt khtyr** (the compacted snow is dangerous) - While the snow is described, it's not the *reason* for the detour.
* **D: enh ashl mn alsfr 'ebr bhr Ross** (it is easier to travel across Ross Sea) - The passage doesn't suggest it's easier to travel across the sea, only that travel to the pole requires specialized sleds and a long route.

"3la twl alqtb aljnwby, ma alshy' almuhdd bala3lam?","The correct answer is **C: shqwq mly'eh balthlj** (crevasses filled with snow).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Innaha thuluj madghuta ma3a shuquq mamlu2a wa mu3allama bil a3lam."" (It is crushed snow with crevasses filled and marked with flags.)  The question asks what the path to the South Pole is like *without* the flags. Therefore, the answer is the crevasses *filled* with snow, which is what lies beneath where the flags are.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: almsar fi mhth McMurdo** (the path from McMurdo) - This is the starting point, not a characteristic of the path itself.
*   **B: aljrarat alty tnql alwqwd** (the sleds that transport fuel) -  These are *used on* the path, they aren't the path itself.
*   **D: anhrafat khtyrh 7wl aljbal** (a long deviation around the mountains) - This describes *why* the path is the way it is, due to needing to avoid mountains, not the path’s physical makeup.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the passage *mentions* exploring by car is a good way to see remote places, it doesn't present it as something the traveler *should be aware of* as a crucial point. It's a suggestion, not a requirement for safe travel.
* **C:** The passage *explicitly contradicts* this. It says ""jami3 al-buldan al-mujawira laysat kadhalik"" (not all neighboring countries are stable).
* **D:**  The passage *recommends* a 4x4, but it doesn't state it's something the traveler *must be aware of* beforehand – it's a strong suggestion for accessibility, not a fundamental rule.  The crucial awareness is *that* different accessibility needs exist, not *specifically* needing a 4x4.

Here's why:

The passage *specifically* warns about being exploited to unknowingly transport drugs across international borders. It details how you could be caught with drugs without your knowledge and face severe penalties.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: qd tt'erd llsrqh** (You might be subjected to theft) - While the passage mentions lost luggage being a target for theft, it's presented as a separate risk, not the primary danger of not keeping your belongings in sight.
* **C: ymkn alkhlt bynha wbyn hqa'eb shkhs akhr** (They could be mixed up with someone else's luggage) - The passage doesn't focus on luggage mix-ups; it's about *illegal substances* being placed in your luggage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

This directly refers to the requirements for a *student visa* (tashyrh talb).  Student visas commonly require proof of financial stability to ensure the student can cover their expenses without becoming a burden on the host country.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: tashyrh al'eml (work visa):** While work visas *can* sometimes require financial documentation, the passage specifically links the financial proof to *studying*.

(Going there as an international student generally requires a longer stay than going as a regular tourist.)  It also details the requirements for student visas - offer letters, proof of funds, etc. - implying a more complex and lengthy visa process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

(It is estimated that there are currently around 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.)  This means there are *more* deer than tigers, not the other way around.

* **B: nsf msahtha alejmalyh mghtah balmstnq'eat** (Half of its total area is covered by swamps) - The passage states ""tughati al-miyah/al-mustanqa3at thuluthaha taqriban"" (approximately one-third of it is covered by water/swamps), which is close enough to half to be considered true within the context of the provided information.
* **C: hy akbr hzam manjrwf fi al'ealm** (It is the largest mangrove forest in the world) - The first sentence explicitly states ""Yu3tabar Sundarbans akbar 7izam sa7ily yatashakkal min ashjar al-mangrove fil 3alam"" (Sundarbans is considered the largest coastal forest formed by mangrove trees in the world).



Therefore, option D is the only statement that contradicts the information given in the passage."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: mhmyh alhyah albryh (wildlife sanctuary)** - While Sundarbans *is* a protected area for wildlife, the text specifically names the *part within India* as the National Park.
* **C: mwq'e lltrath al'ealmy (World Heritage Site)** -  The entire Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, but this doesn't specify the part *within India*.

The passage explicitly connects limited English knowledge to the younger generation. The other options aren't supported by the text:

*   **A:** The text doesn't focus on people who speak other languages.

(Considering that buses between regions are often full, it is best to buy a ticket a few days in advance).

Therefore, someone traveling to Jakar should ideally have a ticket beforehand, aligning perfectly with option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The text says buses to Bumthang *leave* around 7, not that you *need* to arrive by 7.
* **C:** The text doesn't mention any specific time after 11 for travel to Paro. It just mentions the shared taxi cost.

Often the opinions presented are superficial, general, and simplified in an exaggerated way...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **C: altamyn alshy almtathr** (affected security insurance) - Similar to A, the passage implies potential security concerns, not necessarily affected insurance.
* **D: m3lwmat mfslh 3n alhalh alsyasyh fi albld** (detailed information about the political situation in the country) - The passage *specifically* states that advisories offer *simplified* not detailed, information.

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agents are *not* usually a good choice for travelers with prior experience regarding nature, culture, language, or lower-income countries. It also says they are generally good at booking *usual* reservations.  However, it advises using an agent who specializes in trips *similar to yours*.

A first-time international trip is precisely the scenario where someone would *benefit* from an agent's expertise. They likely lack the experience mentioned in the passage and would need help navigating the complexities of international travel.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: rhlh ela m3tmr 'eml fi mdynh zarha almsafr mn qbl** (a business trip to a city the traveler has visited before) - This traveler likely doesn't *need* a travel agent.
* **B: rhlh lmdh asbw'eyn bmyzanyh mhddh llghayh** (a two-week trip with a limited budget) - While an agent *could* help, the passage mentions agents specializing in budget travel, so this isn't a strong indicator of needing one.
* **C: rhlh tntwy 3la hajz lghwy** (a trip involving flight reservations) - Booking flights is something most agents do, and doesn't necessarily mean the traveler needs specialized help.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...usually a travel agent is not a good choice for trips exceeding the traveler's previous experience regarding nature or cultures, or languages, or low-income countries... Many agents specialize in certain types of travel or budget ranges or destinations. It may be best to use an agent accustomed to trips similar to yours.""

This directly implies that a traveler benefits most from an agent when venturing into *unfamiliar* territory – a specialized trip they haven’t done before.  The agent's expertise in those areas would be valuable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't suggest agents are *needed* for round trips to familiar places.
* **C:** If the traveler already knows the language, an agent isn't necessarily helpful.
* **D:** While an agent *could* help with cultural differences, the passage focuses on needing assistance when the trip *exceeds* your experience - meaning you are unfamiliar with the culture to begin with.

Here's why, based on the passage (P):

The passage explicitly states: ""3indama tusafir, la tatawaqqa3 2an takuna al2umur """"kama hiya fi watanik"""". "" (When you travel, do not expect things to be ""as they are in your country"").  It goes on to explain that customs, rules, food, traffic, housing, standards, language, etc., *will* be different.  The key to avoiding disappointment (""khaybat al-amal"") is to *recognize* and *expect* these differences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: alrghbh fi tjrbh alat'emh ghyr almalwfh** (desire to try unfamiliar foods): While openness to new experiences is good, the passage doesn't focus on food specifically as a way to *avoid disappointment*.
* **C: alaltzam bnfs alqwanyn almwjwdh fi almkan aldy yatwn mnh** (adhering to the same laws as the place you come from): This is incorrect and potentially dangerous. You must adhere to the laws of the place you *are visiting*, not your home country.
* **D: tjnb albhth almsbq 3n alskn** (avoiding pre-trip research on accommodation): The passage doesn't mention anything about researching accommodation.  In fact, being prepared would likely *reduce* disappointment.



Therefore, **A** directly reflects the core message of the passage: adjust your expectations to the new environment."

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that travelers should *not* expect things to be ""as they are in their homeland."" It emphasizes differences in customs, rules, food, traffic, accommodation, standards, and language.  It then says failing to consider these differences can lead to ""disappointment"" (khaybat al-2amal) or even rejection of local customs.

A person with a closed mind (mnghlq aldhn) is unwilling to accept or adapt to differences.  They would likely be rigidly expecting things to be the same as they are used to, and therefore would be most prone to disappointment when they aren't.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: shkhs yhb alat'emh alghrybh (a person who loves strange foods):** This person would likely *enjoy* trying new things and wouldn't be disappointed.
* **B: shkhs yzdhr 3la altghyyr (a person who flourishes with change):** This person would likely adapt well and not experience disappointment.
* **D: shkhs ystmt'e balt'elm (a person who enjoys learning):** This person would likely be open to new experiences and wouldn't be disappointed.

The passage specifically advises bringing a sleeping mat or hammock when camping to protect against insects and scorpions. This is a practical item for adjusting to a developing country, particularly if venturing outside of Western-style accommodations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: طعام على الطراز الغربي (Western-style food):** The passage *suggests* sticking to Western food and hotels initially to ease the transition, but doesn't say it's something you *must* bring with you.
* **B: خدمات عالية الجودة (High-quality services):** Similar to A, the passage recommends seeking hotels with Western-quality services for comfort, but doesn't require you to bring them.
* **D: الفنادق عالية الجودة (High-quality hotels):** Again, recommended for easier adjustment, not a mandatory item to bring.

The passage's emphasis on protection *while camping* makes the camping gear the most essential item not already provided.

This translates to: ""Like Delhi Belly, the Curse of the Pharaohs, Montezuma's Revenge, and many others. Just as respiratory problems are common in cold climates, digestive problems are quite common in **hot climates**...""



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ymkn an y'edy alt'erd almntzm ela hsanh mn mada?","The correct answer is **A: almshakl alm3wyh (intestinal problems)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses how different climates can lead to different health problems. It specifically mentions:

*   **""fi al manakhat al 7arra sha2i3atan ila 7addin ma wa fi mu3dham al 7alat takunu muz3ijatan bi shakl wadi7 wa lakinnaha laysat khatiratan 7aqqan""** - which translates to ""in warm climates are quite common and in most cases are clearly irritating but not truly dangerous.""
*   It also references ""Delhi Belly,"" ""Curse of the Pharaohs,"" and ""Montezuma's Revenge"" – all names for traveler's diarrhea and other digestive issues.

The passage is explaining that travelling to new places can expose you to new bacteria, and warmer climates promote bacterial growth, leading to **intestinal problems** (mashakel alm3awyh).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: aljrathym almhlyh (local germs)** – The passage states you are likely *immune* to local germs.
*   **C: almshakl altnfsyh (respiratory problems)** – The passage links respiratory issues to *cold* climates, not warm ones.
*   **D: dlhy byly (Delhi Belly)** – Delhi Belly is *an example* of an intestinal problem, not the overarching category the passage discusses.

ay mma yly hw myzh alsfr dakhl mntqh Schengen?,"The correct answers are **A, B, and C**. Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

* **A: تجنب طلبات التأشيرة المتعددة (Avoiding multiple visa applications)** - The text explicitly states: ""لا تحتاج إلى التقدم للحصول على تأشيرة لكل دولة من دول الأعضاء في شنغن بشكل منفصل"" (You don't need to apply for a visa for each member state of Schengen separately).

* **B: توفير المال (Saving money)** - The text mentions this directly: ""...مما يوفر الوقت والمال"" (...which saves time and money).

* **C: تجنب نقاط التفتيش المتعددة لمراقبة جوازات السفر (Avoiding multiple passport control checkpoints)** -  The text states: ""يمكنك عمومًا عبور الحدود دون المرور عبر نقاط تفتيش مراقبة جوازات السفر مرة أخرى"" (You can generally cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again).

* **D: لا يشترط الحصول على جواز سفر (A passport is not required)** - This is **incorrect**. The text doesn't say a passport isn't needed, just that you don't need *repeated* checks at borders *within* the Schengen area.  You still need a passport to enter the area initially and for international travel outside it.



Therefore, the best answer encompasses all three benefits explicitly mentioned in the passage."
ma aldy lm y'ed mn almmkn al'ethwr 'elyh fi qbr twt 3nkh amwn?,"The correct answer is **D: althrwat (the treasures)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lam ta3ud almaqabir ta7wy atharawat al-muzhila, bal nuqilat ila al-mat7af al-masry bil-qahira."" This translates to: ""The tombs no longer contain the magnificent treasures, but they have been moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: b3d alzkharf (some of the decorations):** The passage states the tomb has *few* decorations (""dhu zakharif qalila""), but doesn't say they are missing.
*   **B: ras almwmya' (the mummy's head):** The passage explicitly states the head is *not* visible (""faqat huma alra's wal katifayn faqat huma aladhayn yumkinu ru2yatuha"" - only the head and shoulders can be seen).
*   **C: aktaf almwmya' (the mummy's shoulders):** The passage explicitly states the shoulders *are* visible (""faqat huma alra's wal katifayn faqat huma aladhayn yumkinu ru2yatuha"" - only the head and shoulders can be seen).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Bowen Island is a popular day trip or weekend getaway *offering kayaking, long walks, shops, and restaurants*.  It's presented as a key attraction accessible from Vancouver.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: جزيرة Granville (Granville Island):** While mentioned as the departure point for the ferry to Bowen Island, it's not presented as a destination *itself* for outdoor enthusiasts.
* **B: ممر Sea to Sky (Sea to Sky Highway):** The text says taking a trip along it is ""essential"" for outdoor lovers, but it's the *route* to destinations, not a destination itself.
* **D: بلدة Whistler (Whistler):** Whistler is mentioned, but the text highlights its *cost* and states it's a distance from Vancouver. It's not presented as being *in* Vancouver or a primary draw *of* Vancouver.



"

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Jazirat Bowen (Bowen Island) is a ""popular day trip or weekend getaway"" offering a genuine experience of the area. It describes the island's community, accessibility, and activities, positioning it as a way to experience the real Vancouver area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: بلدية Whistler (Whistler):** While Whistler is mentioned, the passage states it's *expensive* and a bit of a distance away. It's not presented as offering a typical or easily accessible Vancouver experience.
* **C: وسط مدينة Vancouver (Downtown Vancouver):** Downtown Vancouver is a starting point to *reach* Bowen Island, but not the experience itself.
* **D: جزيرة Granville (Granville Island):** Granville Island is a location from which you *depart* to Bowen Island, it is not the destination offering the authentic experience.

This translates to: ""We confirm that you will get wet if you cross the bridge or walk through the winding paths near the waterfalls. Furthermore, due to the rise in water level, your view of the actual waterfalls will be obscured by the water!""

Therefore, to see the waterfalls *without* obstruction, travelers should visit *outside* the rainy season (November to March) when the water level is lower.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma hw aljanb aleyjaby lzyarh shlalat fyktwrya byn nwfmbr wmars?","The correct answer is **C: mnazr dramyh llshlalat (dramatic views of the waterfall)**.

The text states: ""Fi mawsim hutul al-amtar (ibtida2an min Novemer ila Mars), sayartafi3u mansub 7ajm al-ma2 wa satakunu ashallalat akthar 7idda wa ashadda 3unfan.""  This translates to: ""During the rainy season (starting from November to March), the water level will rise and the waterfalls will be more numerous and more spectacular."" 

Therefore, visiting during November to March provides more dramatic and impressive views of the waterfall due to the increased water volume.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mshahdh alshlalat dwn ay e'eaqh (seeing the waterfall without any obstruction):** The text explicitly says your view *will be obstructed* by the water during this time.
* **B: syah aql (less crowds):** The text doesn't mention crowd levels.
* **D: tjnb mwsm alamtar (avoiding the rainy season):** The question asks about a *benefit* of visiting *during* the rainy season, not avoiding it.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""If you are using a drone, check beforehand what you are allowed to film and what permits or additional licenses are required.""  This directly corresponds to option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: alhswl 3la trkhys edafy** (getting an additional license) - While the text *mentions* needing licenses, it's not the primary thing to do *first*. Checking *what* needs a license is the initial step.
* **C: albhth 7wl altsaryh** (researching permits) - Similar to B, this is a consequence of the initial check, not the check itself.
* **D: altswyr fqt fi almnatq almzdhmh 7yth ln tkwn alta'erh bdwn tyar mlhwzh** (filming in a crowded area where the drone won't be noticed) - The text explicitly says this is a *bad idea*, even if legal.

(Check beforehand what you are allowed to film and what permits or licenses are required).  This directly points to needing permission *before* flying a drone and filming.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While avoiding disturbing people is good practice (mentioned in the last sentence), it doesn’t negate the need for permits.
* **B:** This is the opposite of what the passage suggests – you should *know* what is allowed.
* **C:** Crowded areas are specifically discouraged in the passage (""Da2iman ma yakunu atta7liq ta2ira bidun tayar bil qurb min ... 7ashd min annas fikra sayyi2a"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mrkz llshrth almhlyh (local police station):** The text doesn't mention police stations being involved in registration.
* **C: mktb albryd almhly (local post office):** The text doesn't mention post offices.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that many volunteer positions *don't* pay well, and some only offer minimal stipends. It contrasts volunteering with earning a substantial income. Therefore, someone prioritizing a large salary wouldn't benefit from volunteering while traveling.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: shkhs yaml fi tkwyn sdaqat jdydh syf'el dlk fi alkharj (someone hoping to make new friends will find that abroad)** - The passage highlights meeting new people as a benefit of volunteering abroad.

* **D: shkhs qd ykwn mhtmaan balghrfh walmakl (someone who might be interested in lodging and food)** - The passage states that many volunteer positions *provide* lodging and food, making this a benefit, not a reason someone wouldn't volunteer.

The passage specifically states: ""...العديد من الوظائف التطوعية توفر سكن ووجبات طعام وعدد قليل منهم يدفعون رواتب قليلة"" (...many volunteer jobs provide accommodation and meals, and a few of them pay small salaries).  This directly addresses how volunteering abroad can help someone with a limited budget.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ytm twfyr alratb tqrybaan da'emaan** (A salary is almost always provided) - The passage says *few* volunteer jobs pay a salary, not almost all.
* **B: eadh ma y'edy ela frs 'eml** (Some lead to job opportunities) - While this *could* be a benefit, it’s not mentioned in the provided text as a way to help with a limited budget.

It *also* says Disney warns against it: ""fa-attazakir ghayr qabila lil intiqal ila ghayrik"" (tickets are not transferable to others) - implying staying *outside* Disney is against the typical, planned experience.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: mnatq alhrb (War zones):** While the passage *mentions* war zones as the context for needing this training, it doesn't say the training *covers* war zones themselves in detail. It focuses on preparation *for* visiting such areas.

(Min al-mufid aydan irtida' khatam (laysa khataman yabdu bahidh athaman) - ""It is also beneficial to wear a ring (not one that looks very expensive)."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: edrak anh mn ghyr almalwf atba'eha** (Understand that it is uncommon to be followed) - While the text *mentions* things that might be considered harassment, it doesn’t focus on simply understanding it's uncommon. It focuses on *responding* to it.
* **B: artda' khatm kbyr lldlalh 3la alhalh al'ea'elyh** (Wear a large ring to indicate marital status) - The text suggests wearing *a* ring, not necessarily a large one, and primarily to signal marital status. It's a preventative measure, not a response to harassment.
* **C: fhm an alakhtlafat althqafyh tshyr ela ank ttjnb altmsk bmwqfk** (Understand that cultural differences indicate you should avoid sticking to your position) - This is the *opposite* of what the passage says.

It's difficult to find many rare animals, and sometimes parks have rules regarding taking pictures for commercial purposes. **Wildlife photography often requires a long lens, but things like a flock of birds or a small creature require a different lens.**""

Therefore, the passage directly states a specific lens is needed when photographing small creatures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:**  Rules for commercial photography might exist, but don’t dictate *what* lens to use.
* **C:**  Shyness of the animal doesn’t affect the lens choice.
* **D:** Park rules might exist, but again, don't determine the specific lens needed.

ay mma yly lm ydkr fi alfa8arh ba'etbarh thdyaan mhtmlaan lmswry alhyah albryh?,"The correct answer is **A: al'ethwr 3la hywanat ghrybh mu'eynh** (Finding certain rare animals).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yas3ub al-3uthur 3ala al-3adid min al-7aywanat al-ghariba..."" (It is difficult to find many rare animals...). This *mentions* the difficulty of finding rare animals, but doesn't detail *how* to find them or specific strategies - it's a statement of a challenge.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: alt3aml m3 al7ywanat al'eda'eyh** (Dealing with aggressive animals) - The text *explicitly* states: ""Qad takun al-7ayawanat al-barriya 2imma khajula wa 2imma 3udwaniya."" (Wild animals can be shy or aggressive.)
* **C: alhswl 3la nw'e al'edsat almtlwbh** (Getting the right type of lens) - The text discusses the need for long lenses and different lenses for different subjects: ""Ytatallab taswir al-7ayah al-barriya 3adasa tawila fil aghlab... ya7taj ila 3adasat 2ukhra.""
* **D: al'eml fi by'eat m3adyh mhtmlh** (Working in difficult climates) - The text states: ""Qad takun al-bi2a barida, aw 7arra, aw ghayr mula2ima bi-ayi shakl 2akhar."" (The environment can be cold, hot, or otherwise unpredictable).



Therefore, finding *specific* rare animals, not just acknowledging their rarity, is the detail not elaborated upon in the paragraph."
mn almhtml an ytsbb ay mma yly fi aql almshakl llsa'eq aldy ysafr 'ebr almmrat aljblyh?,"The correct answer is **B: alahtkak almnkhfd (reduced friction)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""3ala atturuq al-jalidiya wa thaljiya, yakunu al-i7tikak munkhafidan wala yumkinuka al-qiyada, wa tabdu wa ka2annaka 3ala asfalt makshuf."" (On icy and snowy roads, friction is reduced and you cannot drive, and it feels like you are on bare asphalt.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: hrkh almrwr alkthyfh (light traffic)** - The passage doesn't mention traffic volume.
* **C: emlyh altkthf almfrth (excessive condensation)** - While condensation is mentioned as *a result* of the weather, it isn't the primary concern the driver needs to *think about*.
* **D: ankhfad alr'eyh (reduced visibility)** - Reduced visibility is also mentioned as a *result* of the weather, but the core issue impacting driving ability is the loss of traction (reduced friction).

The passage emphasizes that a driver in these conditions *must consider* the possibility of ice and snow because they significantly reduce friction, making driving dangerous."
ma aldy mn almhtml an yzl thabtaan bshan drybh aldkhl 'ebr albldan almkhtlfh?,"The correct answer is **B: alhyklyh (the structure)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that income tax *systems* differ significantly between countries. It talks about different *forms* of income tax, different *rates*, and how it's applied at federal and local levels.  This all points to a difference in the *structure* of the income tax system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: alm3dlat (the rates):** While rates *are* different, the passage says rates are *part* of what differs, not the overarching thing to establish as a fact.
* **C: mkan altqdym (place of submission):** The passage mentions *where* you pay taxes (the country you reside in) but doesn't focus on that as the key difference.
* **D: alshira2eh (the regulations):** Similar to rates, regulations are a detail *within* the structure, not the structure itself.



Therefore, the most accurate and encompassing answer, based on the text, is the **structure** of income tax across different countries."
"wfqaan llfa8arh, eda knt t'eml fi alkharj wlknm mwjwdh fi mkan akhr, fayn mn almhtml an tqadam dra'eb dkhlk?","The correct answer is **A: aynma tkwn mwjwd 'eadhan (wherever you are resident)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...fa enna al 3amal fil kharij fi 3umum al amer ya3ni annahu yajeb 3alayka taqdim daribat addakhel fi **addawla al lati tuqim biha**."" (working abroad generally means you must pay income tax in **the country where you reside**).

The question asks where to submit your income tax if you work abroad but are located elsewhere. The passage directly answers this - you submit it in the country of your *residence*.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: fi alwlayat almthdh (in the United States):**  The passage speaks about general principles, not just the US. Residence determines tax filing, not just being in the US.
*   **C: fi albld aldy t'eml fyh halyaan (in the country where you currently work):** While you may have tax obligations to the work country, the passage specifically highlights residence as the determining factor.
*   **D: aynma kant alrswm adna (wherever the fees are lowest):**  Tax laws aren't based on finding the cheapest place to pay.  It's based on your legal residence.

ay mn aljml altalyh la tsf bdqh m3rd 'ealmy?,"The correct answer is **B: ytm 'erd al'erwd alnbatyh jnbaan ela jnb m3 al'erwd alfnyh walt'elymyh** (Botanical exhibits are displayed alongside artistic and educational exhibits).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states that international horticultural exhibitions *focus* on flowers, gardens, and plants.**  While the World Expo (al-ma3radh al-3alamy) showcases a wide range of arts and sciences from participating countries, horticultural exhibitions are a *specialized* event dedicated to plants. They aren't typically integrated *within* a World Expo as a standard part of it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: qd t'erd al'erwd tarykh albld aw thqafth** (Countries may display their history or culture) - This *is* a description of what happens at a World Expo, as stated in the first sentence.
* **C: ymkn an tstmr alahdath hta sth ashhr** (The event can last up to six months) - The passage confirms World Expos usually last between three and six months.
* **D: albldan ghyr mtalbh balmsharkh** (Countries are not required to participate) - The passage implies participation is voluntary by referring to ""adduwal al-musharika"" (participating countries).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tuqaddimu adduwal al-musharika 3urudhan fanniya wa ta3limiya fil ajni7a alwataniya li-3ardh qadaya al-3alam aw thaqafat wa tarikh biladihim."" (Participating countries present artistic and educational exhibits in national pavilions to showcase global issues or the culture and history of their countries.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage states the events *could* theoretically happen annually, but *practically* don't.
* **C:** The passage says they usually last between three and six months, not *until* six months.
* **D:** The passage doesn’t say *all* countries must participate, only that participating countries present exhibits.



"
alqyam bay mma yly syqll mn ahtmalyh wqw'e hjwm hywan?,"The correct answer is **A: حمل على الأعشاب العطرية (Carrying fragrant herbs)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""لتجنب حمل أو تحيّل الطعام ذات الروائح الفواحة والحفاظ على نظافة المخيم."" (To avoid carrying or tempting food with strong smells and keeping the campsite clean.) This directly relates to preventing attracting animals and therefore reducing the risk of attack.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: إزالة القمامة من موقع المخيم (Removing garbage from the campsite):** While important for general safety and cleanliness, the passage focuses on *attracting* animals with scents, not just the presence of garbage.
* **C: الحفاظ على مسافة 25 ياردة من الذئاب (Maintaining a distance of 25 yards from wolves):** The passage states 100 meters from wolves and other large animals, and 25 meters from *all other* wild animals - not 25 yards.
* **D: ردع الحيوانات بفضلات الطعام (Deterring animals with food scraps):** This is the opposite of what the passage advises. You should *not* feed or attract animals with food.



"
ay mma yly lm ydkr fi alfa8arh ksbb mhtml lhjmat alhyah albryh?,"The correct answer is **A: alrwa'eh alqwyh (strong smells)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage *does* mention strong smells:** The text explicitly states ""tajannab 7aml aw tahy al-at3ima dhat arra2i7a al-fawa7a"" which translates to ""avoid carrying or preparing foods with strong smells."" This is done to prevent attracting wild animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: edm alhfaz 3la almsafh (not maintaining distance):** The passage clearly states the required distances from animals and mentions injuries occur due to not keeping a safe distance.
* **C: et3am alhyah albryh (feeding wild animals):** The passage specifically says ""wala yanbaghy it3am hadhihi al-7ayawanat"" - ""these animals should not be fed.""
* **D: al7ywanat ghyr almtalfh m3 albshr (animals not accustomed to humans):** The passage begins by stating many animals are accustomed to humans, but *still* need to remain wild and undisturbed.
