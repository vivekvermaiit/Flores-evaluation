"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini lebeyingeke itsatfwe njenge thiphu lekungiyo yekudlala ngemphumelelo inkositini?","The correct answer is **A: Kute utfole ivolomu lengetiwe, khulisa emandla loshaya ngawo sikhiya**.

Here's why:

The passage *specifically* states: ""Kulenkositini, kutfola umsindvo lowengetiwe, usebentisa tifutfo leticindzetela kakhulu noma letinesivinini lesikhulu."" and also ""asikho sidzingo sekucindzetela emabhathini ngemandla lamakhulu kute ukhulise umsindvo"". This directly contradicts the idea of increasing force to get louder volume.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **B:** The passage encourages avoiding unnecessary tension (""futsi tama kutsi ungacinisi tandla kakhulu ngetingalo takho"").
*   **C:** The passage begins by stating ""Yenta siciniseko sekutsi sandla sakho sikhululekile uma usashaya emanothi kahle"" (Make sure your hand is relaxed when you play notes well).
*   **D:** The passage states that volume can be increased by using keys that are pressed harder or have greater velocity.



"
"Uma udlala inkositini, ngukuphi lokutawusita kukhulisa Ivolomu?","The correct answer is **A: Sivinini lesingetiwe** (Increased velocity).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...kutfola umsindvo lowengetiwe, usebentisa tifutfo leticindzetela kakhulu **noma letinesivinini lesikhulu**.""  This translates to ""...getting increased volume, using fingers that press harder **or that have higher velocity**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Emandla langetiwe (Increased strength):** The passage *explicitly* says not to press the keys with excessive force (""asikho sidzingo sekucindzetela emabhathini ngemandla lamakhulu"").
* **C: Kucindzetela lokuphasi (Passing pressure):** This doesn't directly relate to increasing volume as described in the text.
* **D: Kunyangata kwemunwe lokuphasi (Passing finger flexibility):** While finger flexibility is important for playing, the passage focuses on velocity and force as volume controls.

Kungani titfombe letikumabonakudze tijube imincele yato?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngako sitfombe sigcwalisa sikilini sonkhe** (So the image fills the entire screen).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the black bars are added to ensure ""the image is seen completely on the screen."" This process is called ""filling the image on the screen.""  The passage also explains that when making a DVD, these bars get included, which can cause issues with subtitles or text at the top and bottom.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuvumela imibhalo lengaphasi** (To allow subtitles) - While the bars *can* affect subtitles, that's a *result* of the bars, not the *reason* for them.
*   **C: Kuvumela kugucula lokulula kwalamanye emafomathi** (To allow easy conversion to other formats) - The passage doesn't mention anything about format conversion.
*   **D: Kujuba imibhalo lengaphasi dvutane kakhulu naphasi** (To make subtitles more visible at the bottom) - This is the opposite of what the passage describes; the bars actually *hide* parts of the screen, including potentially subtitles.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngutiphi tinkinga kuleti letilandzelako umuntfu langahle ahlangabetane nato uma agucula ibhayisikobho ibe ifomethi ye-DVD?","The correct answer is **B: Imibhalo lephasi isikwe kancane** (Text at the bottom is cut off).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that when converting to DVD, captions or text that was originally at the top and bottom of the screen (like subtitles) may be cut off.  This is because DVDs are expected to include the full border of the image and the passage says that text ""won't appear well"" if it was positioned near the edges originally.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sitfombe lesingagcwali sikilini sonkhe** (Image doesn't fill the screen) - The passage explains that the original broadcasts *fill* the screen, which is the problem.
* **C: Sitfombe lesigcwala sikilini sonkhe** (Image fills the screen) - The passage does *not* say this is the problem; it's the reason the text gets cut off.
* **D: Juba imichele** (Too much border) - While a border is mentioned, it's not described as the *problem* itself, just a consequence.



"
Belikuphi libutfo lemasotja aseBhrithani?,"The correct answer is **A: I-Assunpink Creek**.

The text states that General Ewing ""would station 700 troops at the Trenton Ferry, harass the enemy vigorously at Assunpink Creek and prevent all the enemy troops from escaping."" This clearly indicates the British troops were at or near Assunpink Creek.
"
Kwabani lokusayina lokuvele kulokusalungiswa lokubhalwe ngesandla?,"The correct answer is **D: Ya-Charles Thomson**.

Here's why:

The passage states the document was signed by President of the Continental Congress John Hancock **and Secretary Charles Thomson**. The question asks who *signed* the document alongside Hancock. Therefore, Charles Thomson is the correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ya-John Dunlap** - John Dunlap was the printer, not a signer.
*   **B: Ya-George Washington** - George Washington *received* a copy and read it to his troops, but did not sign the original.
*   **C: Ya-John Nixon** - John Nixon was the first to read the document publicly, but didn't sign it.



"
"Kuletindzawo letilandzelako, kukuphi lapho i-Dunlap broadside yafika khona ekugcineni?","The correct answer is **C: e-London**.

The passage states: ""Ikhophi yafika eLondon mhlaka-10 ngeNgci."" (A copy arrived in London on November 10th).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: i-New York** - While a copy was *read* to soldiers in New York, it wasn't the final destination of a broadside.
* **B: Sitolo sekuphrinta sa-Dunlap** - The broadsides were *printed* at Dunlap's print shop, but that wasn't the final destination.
* **D: i-Independence Hall** - The document was first *read* there, but it was then distributed to other places.



"
Bewahlala kuphi emasotja a-Colonel Stark?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngasenyakatfo yempumalanga ye-peninsula**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ematsotja lacinisa letikhudla letiphambili ahlanganisa libutfo lekucala nelesitfatfu lemadvodza langema-200 aseNew Hampshire...Ngekhatsi kwehla kwemanti lokuphansi kuvula umsele kulomfula iMystic **ngasenyakatfo-mphumalanga yePeninsula**...""

This directly states that Colonel Stark's troops gathered on the northeast side of the peninsula.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, emadvodza aStark alule dalada wawo?","The correct answer is **B: Ngemuva kwekutsi labajwayelekile bandlulise sigcobo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Emadvodza aStark abegudle fenisi eme ngale kulelelinye live."" (Stark's men dug a fence on the other side of the river.) This implies they dug the fence *after* crossing the river (the ""sigcobo"" - crossing/ford).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngalesikhatsi Emakholoni acela kuciniswa** - The colonists asking to be pardoned isn't related to when they dug the fence.
*   **C: Ngesikhatsi seligagazi lelincane** -  The text mentions a small ditch but doesn't link it to when the fence was dug.
*   **D: Ngalesikhatsi emasotja atsatsa tikhundla letiphambili** - While the soldiers were taking positions, the text specifies the fence was dug *after* they crossed the river.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi kwalokungulokunye kwetikhatsi teludlame kakhulu eChina?","The correct answer is **D: Sikhatsi Semibuso Lemitsatfu**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Phakatsi netikhatsi kwaba timphi letineludlame emkhatsini webantfu labanyenti labaphila ngendlela lephakeme balwela bukhosi... tinkhulungwane tebantfu tafa tilwela kuhlala etihlalweni letiphakeme eXi’an"" **during the Period of the Three Kingdoms** (Sikhatsi Semibuso Lemitsatfu).  It directly links widespread violence and fighting for power to this period.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bukhosi baJin:** The passage mentions the Jin Dynasty as *following* the Three Kingdoms period, not being a time of intense conflict itself within the excerpt.
*   **B: Sikhatsi se-Xi’an:** Xi’an is mentioned as a location where people fought for power, but it's not the *period* of the violence.
*   **C: Bukhosi baHan:** The Han Dynasty is mentioned as a period *before* the Three Kingdoms, and the text doesn’t highlight it as particularly violent within this context.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, liyini liciniso ngemasotja etintfutfwane letingena esigabeni sekuzulazula?","The correct answer is **A: Bahlala ebusuku**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngesikhatsi sekuzulazula, tintfutfwane letilubutfo timasha ebusuku futsi time emini kuze tiphumule."" This directly translates to: ""During the wandering phase, the soldier termites march at night and rest during the day.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Banekudla lokuncane** - The passage mentions food scarcity *during* the hardship stage (ikholoni icala sigaba sekuphila ngekukhatsateka ngesikhatsi kuncipha kudla), not specifically during the wandering phase.
* **C: Bakha tidleke letishintjwako ngemuva kwemalanga langu-17** - The passage says they build temporary nests *every* day, not after 17 days.
* **D: Bamasha emini** - The passage explicitly states they march at *night* (timasha ebusuku).



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngusiphi sitatimende lesikhombisa ngalokungiko imikhuba yekuhlala kwemasotja etintfutfwane phakatsi nesigaba sekutilula?","The correct answer is **C: Bashintja tidleke wonkhe malanga.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ikholoni icala sigaba sekuphila ngekukhatsateka ngesikhatsi kuncipha kudla. Kulesikhatsi, lekholoni yenta tilulu tesikhashana letishintjwako onkhe emalanga.""  This translates to ""The colony enters a stage of life with hardship when food decreases. At this time, the colony makes temporary nests that are changed every day.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bakha tindleke ebusuku** - The passage says they *move* at night, not build nests.
* **B: Bamasha emalanga langu-17 ngaphandle kwekuhlala** - The passage doesn't mention a specific number of days (17) or a period without settling.
* **D: Basebentisa tidleke letifanako ngesikhatsi sesigaba** - The passage explicitly states the nests are *changed* every day, meaning they are not the same.



"
Ngikuphi lokulandzelako lokutochubeka nangetulu kwekubakhona kwetimphawu tangaphandle?,"The correct answer is **C: Emawashi etintfo letiphilako**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Emawashi laphilako langema-oscillator latigcinako latochubeka sikhatsi sekugijima noma tingekho tinkhomba tangaphandle."" (Living clocks, as oscillators, maintain a sense of time even without external cues.)  This directly refers to the ability of biological clocks to continue functioning independently of external signals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Imijikeleto lengapheli (Perpetual cycles):** While biological rhythms *create* perpetual cycles, the passage focuses on the mechanism *driving* those cycles - the biological clocks themselves.
*   **B: Tigci tetikhatsi (Environmental cues):**  The passage emphasizes that the clocks function *even without* environmental cues.
*   **D: Tigci letibukwako (Observed cycles):**  This refers to what we *see* happening, not the internal mechanism.



"
Nguliphi ligama lelichaza bantfu labakhombisa kuhluka kwesici lesitsite se-phenotypic?,"The correct answer is **D: I-Polymorphic**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Nangabe bantfu bakhombisa kuhluka esicini lesitsite kutsiwa ba-polymorphic."" (If people show variation in a specific trait, they are called polymorphic.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I-Monomorphic** - The passage states this refers to people who are *identical* in a trait, not those who show variation.
*   **B: Tintfo letiphilako** - This translates to ""living things"" and is too broad.
*   **C: Tinhlobo** - This translates to ""types"" or ""species"" and doesn't directly relate to individual trait variation.



"
Nguliphi ligama lelifanele kulawa lalandzelako etintfo letiphilako letihlala endzaweni letsite?,"The correct answer is **A: I-Monomorphic**.

Here's why:

The passage defines monomorphic as when all individuals have the same characteristics (phenotype). The question asks for the term describing living things in a specific area that are all the same.  Therefore, monomorphic is the best fit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Linani lebantfu** (Population size) - This refers to *how many* individuals there are, not their similarity.
* **C: Tinhlobo** (Species) - This is a broader classification, not specifically about uniformity within a location.
* **D: I-Polymorphic** - This is the *opposite* of what the question is asking for; it describes variation.



"
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokungeke kube sibonelo semsebenti wekuvakasha losuselwe tikwendalo?,"The correct answer is **A: Kuhamba ngetinyawo kuya empophomeni (Walking to the waterfall)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on tourism *specifically* related to appreciating and learning about nature – its beauty, plants, and animals.**  The examples given (hiking, fishing, birdwatching, visiting parks, learning about the environment) all directly involve interacting with and appreciating the natural world.

Let's look at why the other options *are* examples of nature-based tourism:

* **B: Kutfwebula timbali tasendle (Photographing wildflowers)** - Directly involves appreciating and documenting natural beauty.
* **C: Kuvakashela imnyuziyemu yesayensi (Visiting a science museum)** - While a museum *can* have exhibits about nature, the passage implies direct engagement *in* nature, not learning about it indoors. A museum is less directly connected to experiencing the natural environment itself.
* **D: Kudoba tindiza (Fishing for birds)** - While potentially harmful, the act of *trying* to obtain something from nature falls within the scope of the passage’s definition, even if it's not ideal. (Note: This is ethically questionable and likely illegal in many places.)

**Walking to a waterfall (A) is simply a physical activity.** While a waterfall *is* a natural feature, simply *going* to see it doesn't necessarily involve the appreciation, learning, or engagement with the wider environment described in the passage. You could walk to a waterfall without paying any attention to the plants, animals, or geology around it.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokusisekelo sendlela yekusebenta yetekutfutsa?","The correct answer is **C: I-Biosphere lezinzile**.

Here's why:

The passage states that scientists now believe carbon was removed from where it once existed and where the foundation for the stable biosphere of the last two million years was based. This directly relates to the idea of a stable environment (biosphere) being a foundational element.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tindzawo tekusebenta (Workplaces)** - While the passage mentions people traveling to work, it doesn't present workplaces as the basis for how climate change functions.
*   **B: Timoto letitimele (Cars)** - Cars are mentioned in relation to commuting, but aren't fundamental to understanding climate change.
*   **D: Kugucuka kwemvelo yebantfu (Changes in human nature)** - The passage focuses on *environmental* change, not changes in human behavior or nature.



"
Tincenye letitungeleta i-nucleus tinaluphi luhlobo lekushaja?,"The correct answer is **D: Kushaja lokuhle nalokungasikahle**.

Here's why:

* **Protons** have a positive electric charge (kushaja lokuhle).
* **Neutrons** have no charge (kute kushaja - which can also be understood as neutral).

Since the nucleus is made up of both protons and neutrons, it contains both positive and no charge. Therefore, the nucleus has both a positive and neutral charge.



"
I-nucleus yakhiwe ngutiphi tincenye?,"The correct answer is **A: Emaphrothoni nema neutrons** (Protons and neutrons).

The text explicitly states: ""Inyukliyasi inetintfo letimbili - emanyuthroni nemaphrothoni."" which translates to ""The nucleus consists of two things - protons and neutrons.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ema-Neutron nema electron** - Electrons orbit the nucleus, they are *not* inside it.
* **C: Ema- Electron nema Proton** - Electrons orbit the nucleus, they are *not* inside it.
* **D: Ema-Proton, ema-neutron, kanye nema electron** - Electrons orbit the nucleus, they are *not* inside it.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokusibonelo senombolo yanombolombili lemihlanu?","The passage states that binary numbers consist of only 0 and 1. 

Let's look at the options:

*   **A: 1010** - Contains only 0s and 1s.
*   **B: 12001** - Contains the number 2, which is not allowed in binary.
*   **C: 10010** - Contains only 0s and 1s.
*   **D: 110101** - Contains only 0s and 1s.

The question asks for *an example* of a five-digit binary number. All options A, C and D are valid binary numbers with five digits. Without further constraints, any of them would be correct. However, the question doesn't specify the length, so any of the options containing only 0 and 1 are correct.

Let's choose **A: 1010** as the answer. It's the shortest and simplest example.

**Final Answer: A**"
Tinombolo tanombolombili tiphindze tibitwe ngekutsi tiyini?,"The correct answer is **A: Emabhithi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the numbers consisting of 0s and 1s are called ""tincetu"" (which translates to digits) *or* ""emabhithi"" (which translates to bits).  ""Emabhithi"" is the established computer science term for binary digits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Emanani:** Means numbers in general, not specifically binary digits.
* **C: Ijagoni:** Doesn't relate to binary numbers or computer science.
* **D: Emafomu:** Means forms or shapes, also irrelevant.



"
Ngikuphi lokulandzelako lokungakashiwo endzimeni njengenzuzo leyiyinhloko yeku-bhuloga bafundzi?,"The correct answer is **A: Intutfuko ehlelweli lelulwimi nelukhono lekubhala** (Improvement in language proficiency and writing skills).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that blogs can help students *“kutsi batfutfukise kubhala”* (to improve their writing) and mentions the problems students have with language and spelling in blog posts, suggesting improvement is a key benefit.  It connects this to how authors work to refine their writing to avoid criticism.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Kuncipha kwekugcekwa bontsanga** (Reduced plagiarism) - While the passage mentions avoiding plagiarism by improving writing, it's not the *main* benefit discussed.
* **C: Kucaphela lokunabile ngendzawo letungeletiwe** (Comfortable expression in a defined space) - The passage touches on expression, but doesn’t focus on comfort or a ‘defined space’.
* **D: Kwandza kwesifiso sekuchubeka nekufundza** (Increased desire to continue learning) -  While blogs can *encourage* continued learning, the passage focuses more on the *skills* developed through blogging.



"
Ngutiphi kuletincenye letilandzelako tekubhuloga letibalulwe njengetikhutsati kubafundzi kutsi batfutfukise emakhono abo ekubhala?,"The correct answer is **C: Kugcina sitsakaselo setilaleli** (Maintaining audience interest).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""kuba khona kwetibukeli ngalokuvamile kuyakushintja loko."" (the presence of an audience will often change that). This directly relates to students being mindful of their writing *because* they know others will be reading it, thus encouraging them to improve.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Lokuvame kuphendvula etintfweni letivela ku-inthanethi** (Frequently responding to posts from the internet) - While mentioned as a benefit of blogging (""ngekutsi baphendvule etintfweni te-Inthanethi...""), it's presented as a *result* of improved skills, not a core motivator *to* improve.
* **B: Sifiso sekugwema kugcekwa** (Desire to avoid criticism) -  The passage mentions authors working to avoid criticism, but it applies more to professional writers and isn't presented as a primary motivator for students using blogs.
* **D: Sidzingo sekubambisana** (Need for collaboration) - Collaboration is highlighted as a characteristic of blogs (""Ku-Blog litfuluzi leligcugcutela kusebentisana""), but not a key reason *why* they help students write better.



"
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokungasiyo inzuzo yekuchumana lokungavumelani kwebafundzi? ,"The correct answer is **C: Emahora ekusebenta lagucugucukako**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngalokwengetiwe, kunekulinganiselwa kwesikhatsi lokumbalwa nakuchatsaniswa nesikhatsi sekusebenta lesikhululekile.""  This translates to ""Furthermore, there is a reduction in working hours compared to traditional working hours.""  Therefore, *reduced* working hours is a benefit, not a disadvantage.

Let's look at why the other options *are* benefits mentioned in the passage:

*   **A: Kusetjentiswa kwe-inthanethi njengensita** (Using the internet as a resource) - The passage explicitly states the internet allows students to access information anytime.
*   **B: Kufinyelela kwebuso nebuso kubafundzisi nanoma ngusiphi sikhatsi selusuku** (Access to teachers face-to-face at any time of day) - The passage mentions students can ask teachers questions and get immediate responses, effectively providing access at any time.
*   **D: Kulawula litubane** (Controlling pace) - The passage mentions allowing students to work at their own pace and learn at a speed suited to them.



"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, nguyiphi kuletincenye letilandzelako tekuchumana lokungafaki sikhatsi kwebafundzi lokungavumelana netimo?","The correct answer is **D: Kusetjentiswa kwe-inthanethi** (The use of the internet).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the internet allows students to access information *anytime* and ask questions and receive answers *immediately*, rather than waiting for face-to-face meetings. This directly addresses the idea of asynchronous communication – learning that isn't bound by time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sivinini sekufundza (Learning environment):** While the passage mentions flexibility in learning *pace*, it doesn't specifically focus on the learning environment itself as being asynchronous.
* **B: Emahora ekusebenta (Working hours):**  The passage contrasts limited scheduled time with *flexible* work time, but doesn't say working hours *are* asynchronous.
* **C: Tintfo tekufundzisa (Teaching materials):** The passage doesn't center around the materials themselves being asynchronous, but rather *how* students access information and interact.



"
Yini lengakabalwa kulendzima njengentfo umuntfu langahle ayihlanganise netincaba tesikhatsi se-medieval?,"The correct answer is **B: Ema-Jousts**.

Here's why:

* **The passage heavily focuses on the romanticized, often fantastical, image of the medieval period.** It talks about knights, magic in stories (Arthurian legends), and the sounds and smells of battles – all elements associated with the *performance* and spectacle of medieval life, rather than the gritty reality. 
* **Jousts (Ema-Jousts)** were a prominent part of that performance. They were elaborate, highly ritualized tournaments that showcased knightly skill and were a major form of entertainment.  They are directly related to the imagery of knights and battles the passage evokes.

Let's look at why the other options are less fitting:

* **A: Imigodzi lakuvalelwa khona tiboshwa (Dungeons where prisoners were held):** While dungeons existed, they represent a darker, less glamorous aspect of the medieval period. The passage leans towards the romanticized, heroic view.
* **C: Buchawe (Famine):** Famine was a serious problem, but again, doesn't align with the focus on heroic imagery and fantastical tales.
* **D: Ema-Knights (Knights):** While knights are *mentioned*, the passage is about the *idea* of knights, the stories *around* them, not just their existence.  Jousts *represent* that idealized image in action.



"
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakakhulunywa endzimeni njengeliphunga noma umsindvo longavakala phakatsi kwemanciwa enkinga?,"The correct answer is **B: Kusaba**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses the feeling of fear (""kuva liphunga lekwesaba lelichamuka emigodzini yemajele"" - smelling the scent of fear from dungeons). ""Kusaba"" directly translates to fear or being afraid.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Timpi:** Means drums, not related to feelings evoked by memories.
*   **C: Emadzili:** Means dungeons - the *location* where the fear originates, not the feeling itself.
*   **D: Tinselo:** Means stars, completely unrelated to the passage's context.



"
Nguyiphi kulokulandzelako inchazelo lecondzile yeKirby Muxloe Castle?,"The correct answer is **B: Beyidzinga kuciniswa lokuncane ngenca yesimo selive lesinekuthula ngalesikhatsi kwakhiwa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that in the 1480s, when the castle was being built by Lord Hastings, the area was peaceful and defense was only needed against a few farmers. This directly supports the idea that it didn’t require extensive fortification because of the peaceful surroundings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tindvonga letikhulu teCastle tacelwa nguLord Hastings** - While true (Lord Hastings *did* commission the building), this doesn't explain the castle's *character* as described in the passage.
*   **C: Kwakhiwa kweCastle bekungasiyo intfo levamile ngesikhatsi** - The passage doesn't mention whether castle building was common or not.
*   **D: Yakhelwe kusekela kuhlaselwa lokudze nekutimisela** - The passage specifically says the opposite: the lack of threat meant extensive defense wasn’t necessary. In fact, it later states it wasn't suitable for sustained attacks.



"
Ngutiphi kuleti tici letilandzelako tekwakha letingatsatfwa njengaletijwayelekile te-Kirby Muxloe Castle ngesikhatsi lesichazwe endzimeni?,"The correct answer is **C: Kuciniswa lokuncane kunalamanye ema-Castle (It was more of a manor house than a castle)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Kirby Muxloe Castle was ""more of a manor house than a castle"" due to its large windows and thin walls. The need for defense was minimal at the time of its construction because of the peaceful surroundings and only a few potential attackers (farmers).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Emafasitelo lamakhulu (Large windows):** While the passage mentions large windows, this is presented as a *weakness* in defense, not a typical castle feature.
*   **B: Sisekelo lesakhelwe kusekela kuhlaselwa (Foundation built to withstand attack):** The passage says the opposite - the structure wasn't built for strong defense.
*   **D: Emadvonga lamancane (Small walls):** While related to the thin walls mentioned, the passage more broadly discusses the building's overall character as being less castle-like.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokungazuzisa kakhulu kumgijimi lolungiselela sikhatsi lesitako?","The correct answer is **D: Kusebentisa i-gym kutivocavoca umtimba losetulu** (Using the gym to exercise the upper body).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Leminye imicudzelwano yekugijima uze ungene kulelinye live ngesikhatsi sasebusika, ihlanganiswe nekujimisa incenye lengetulu yemtimba wakho, kuyindlela lekahle yekutilolongela umcudzelwano wekugijima."" (Some cross-country running competitions in winter involve exercising the upper part of your body, which is a good way to prepare for the running competition.)

This directly links upper body workouts to preparing for running competitions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kutijwayeta kugijima emaveni lahlukene ehlobo** (Practicing running on different terrains in summer) - The passage doesn't mention summer training or varying terrain.
*   **B: Gcila ekuhlakuleleni sivinini ngalesikhatsi ucecesha** (Focus on speeding up while stretching) - While speed is mentioned, focusing on stretching *while* speeding isn’t a key takeaway.
*   **C: Kushaya sikhatsi semizuzu lemitsatfu** (Spending three minutes) - The passage mentions a two-minute gap between runners, but doesn’t suggest spending *three minutes* on any specific activity.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokubaluleke kakhulu kumgijimi welibanga lekucala?","The correct answer is **D: Kuhlakulela sivinini ngetulu kwelitubane**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kuliciniso kutsi ingijimi legijima tigaba letingetulu kwehhafu yelimayela, lengakhona nekutsi lamlandzelako amshiye ngesikhatsi lesiyimizuzu lemibili kufanele agijime ngelitubane lelisetulu kodvwa yonkhe imijaho idzinga kukhutsatela.""  This translates to: ""It is true that a runner who runs stages higher than half a mile, even if the next one leaves in two minutes, should run on the upper tube, but all races require speed."" 

This directly emphasizes that **speed (kukhutsatela)** is crucial for all runners, more so than simply making it *over* the tube (beketela). The passage frames reaching the tube as something that isn't *that* important, but speed is.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kutijwayeta kugijima emaveni lahlukene ngetinyanga yebusika (Practicing running on different terrains in winter):** While the passage mentions winter running as preparation, it doesn't state it's the *most* important thing.
*   **B: Kuhlakulela kubeketela ngetulu kwelitubane (Learning to climb over the tube):** The passage specifically says getting over the tube isn't the biggest deal.
*   **C: Kungena ngaphasi kwemizuzu lemibili (Entering under two minutes):** This is a specific benchmark for *some* runners, but the passage states speed is important for *all* races.

"Kumsubatsi, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungeke kufezwe ngekusebentisa tinchubo tekudla lokunemsoco?","The correct answer is **B: Injabulo lengetiwe (Increased happiness)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a balanced diet alone won't achieve things at a high level, *but* it can lay a foundation for small improvements in life. It focuses on maintaining good health, energy, hydration, and understanding how nutrients help bodies function and *enjoy* activity. 

While a good diet contributes to overall well-being, which *can* lead to happiness, it doesn't *guarantee* increased happiness. Happiness is influenced by many factors beyond just diet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kusebenta lokutfutfukisiwe (Improved performance):** The passage directly mentions how nutrients help bodies function and improve how they perform.
*   **C: Kusebenta lokuhle kakhulu (Optimal function):**  The passage states the diet contributes to good health and energy levels which are elements of optimal function.
*   **D: Imphilo jikelele (Overall health):** The passage explicitly states that a balanced diet helps maintain good health.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakaphakanyisa njengendlela yekuba basubatsi labasebasha batfole injabulo lengetiwe emdlalweni wabo?","The correct answer is **D: Kugcina ibhalansi yemandla lanemphilo** (Maintaining a balance of health and energy).

Here's why:

The passage states that a good diet ""can be a foundation for small improvements in your life. It keeps you healthy and energetic..."" and also mentions hydration and understanding how to use resources to improve performance and *enjoyment* of the game.  This directly aligns with maintaining overall health and energy balance for a better experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kwenta Kudla lokufanele** (Eating the right food) - While important, the passage says it's a *foundation* for improvements, not the direct route to increased enjoyment.
* **B: Kusebenta ngalokuchubekako ezingeni lelisetulu** (Working continuously at a high level) - The passage explicitly says focusing *only* on high-level performance won't bring enjoyment.
* **C: Kutsambisa ngemphumelelo** (Achieving success) - The passage doesn't focus on success as the key to enjoyment, but rather on the process and well-being.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, kungani umsubatsi welibanga leliphakatsi angahle atsenge lucetu lemshini lobita kakhulu?","The correct answer is **D: Kenemibono leliphutsa mayelana nemishini lengabiti kakhulu.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...tintfo letitsite tingatsengwa natidzingeka, kodvwa letinyenti titawuba nemphumela lomncane noma tibe bete nje sanhlobo."" This translates to: ""Equipment can be bought and needed, but much of it will have little effect or be completely useless.""

This directly supports the idea that a community competition participant might have *false ideas* about cheaper equipment – believing it's sufficient when it likely isn't. The passage emphasizes that expensive equipment doesn't guarantee success, but *much* equipment (including cheaper options) won't have a significant impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kukhetsa kwabo sicu** (They choose because of greed) - The passage doesn't mention greed as a motivation.
*   **B: Inetinzuzo letifakazelwe** (It has proven benefits) - The passage explicitly says many items have *little* effect.
*   **C: Itoba nemtselela lomuhle ekusebenteni kwabo** (It will have a good influence on their work) -  The passage doesn't imply that expensive equipment necessarily improves work quality; it just doesn't guarantee it.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kugijima kwelibanga lelisemkhatsini kudzingani?","The correct answer is **A: Imishini leminingi** (Lots of equipment).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tintfo letitsite tingatsengwa natidzingeka..."" which translates to ""Equipment can be bought and is needed...""  It then goes on to say a lot of equipment might have little benefit, but it *is* needed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sizindza sekusubatsa lesimisiwe** (A fixed subscription fee) - The passage doesn't mention any fees.
* **C: Imishini lencane kakhulu** (Very little equipment) - The passage directly contradicts this, saying equipment is *needed*.
* **D: Imali leningi** (A lot of money) - While money is likely needed to *buy* the equipment, the passage focuses on the equipment itself being required.

Ngubani lowatfola i-nuclear magnetic resonance? ,"The correct answer is **C: I-Bloch kanye ne-Purcell**.

The passage states: ""...leyatfolwa ngabo 1930 ngu-Felix Bloch (asebenta eNyuvesi yaseStanford) na-Edward Purcell (lobuya eNyuvesi yeHarvard)."" which translates to ""...discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (at Harvard University).""

While Damadian made important contributions to *using* NMR for medical imaging, he didn't *discover* the phenomenon itself."
Lilungelo lekucala lebunikati laniketwa ngamuphi umnyaka yetekwelapha i-imaging resonance? ,"The correct answer is **A: 1977**.

The passage states: ""Ngemuva kweminyaka lemine lilungelo lebunikati baniketwa, lelilungele belilekucala emhlabeni lelake laniketwa MRI. Nga-1977, Dokotela Damadian wacedzela kwakhiwa kweMRI scanner yekucala """"yemtimba-wonkhe"""" leyabitwa ngekutsi """"Ayitsaniswa"""".""  This translates to: ""After four years a patent was granted, the first in the world patent was granted to MRI. In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first """"whole-body"""" MRI scanner called """"Omitron"".""

Therefore, the first patent was granted in 1977."
"ngekusho kwendzima, yini lekufanele kutsi bantfu bayivisise ngalokucinile kute bachaze tento talabanye letingekwenyama?","The correct answer is **D: Kucondza** (Understanding/Empathy).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kubalulekile **kucondza** tisusa talabanye."" (It is important to **understand** the reasons of others.)  The entire passage revolves around the difficulty of knowing what others think, feel, believe, want, and are motivated by – all aspects of *understanding* their perspective.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sifiso** (Desire) - While understanding desires is *part* of understanding someone, it's not the overarching skill the passage emphasizes.
* **B: Inhloso** (Purpose) - Similar to desire, purpose is a component, but not the whole picture.
* **C: Inkolelo** (Belief) - Beliefs are important, but the passage stresses understanding the *reasons* behind actions, which go beyond just knowing what someone believes.



The example of the woman breaking into a car perfectly illustrates the need to *understand* the situation before jumping to conclusions.  You need to consider her reasons (lost keys, owning the car) before assuming she's stealing it."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kuvisisa injongo kusita bantfu kutsi benteni?","The correct answer is **D: Fundza tingcondvo talabanye**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that humans are very good at learning the motivations of others (""bantfu basembili kakhulu kunato tonkhe tintfo letiphilako ngekufundza tingcondvo talabanye""). It then goes on to explain *why* understanding motivations is important - to avoid jumping to conclusions and to see things from another's perspective.  The example given illustrates needing to understand *why* someone is doing something before judging them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kucedza kungaciniseki ngemuva kwetento temtimba (Reduce uncertainty behind a physical action):** While understanding motivations can *reduce* uncertainty, the passage focuses on understanding the *reasons* for actions, not just reducing confusion.
* **B: Cagela tifiso (Predict desires):**  Understanding motivations helps you understand *why* someone wants something, not necessarily predict what they will want in the future.
* **C: Buka labanye bantfu ngaphandle kwekukwahlulela (Look at other people without judging):** This is a *result* of understanding motivations, but not the act of understanding itself.  You need to understand *why* someone is doing something before you can truly avoid judging.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokufinciwe lokungiko kwenhloso ye-Al?","The correct answer is **D: Umsebenti lotentakalelako** (Automated tasks).

Here's why:

The passage states that AI research ""involves changing tasks requiring human intelligence to be done by a machine."" This directly points to automating tasks that normally need a person's thinking ability. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kulungiselela (Preparation)** - While AI can *help* with preparation (like scheduling), it's not the core goal.
* **B: Kukhumbula livi (Remembering facts)** - AI can store and retrieve information, but that's a *tool* for achieving a bigger purpose, not the purpose itself.
* **C: Kuhlela (Planning)** - Similar to preparation, AI can assist with planning, but isn't the overarching goal.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lavame kuhlotjaniswa nako Al?","The correct answer is **B: Kuhlela kanye nekuhlela**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Al's research includes ""kucondzisa, kuhlela kanye nekwenta emlungiselelo"" (reasoning, planning, and making arrangements). This directly aligns with ""kuhlela kanye nekuhlela"" (planning and organizing).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kusitakala kwebatsengi (Artistic creation)** - The passage doesn't mention artistic creation as a function of Al.
*   **C: Inganekwane yesayensi (Science fiction)** - The passage states Al *doesn't* have a solid definition of science fiction, but it is about Al's accomplishments in science, not science fiction itself.
*   **D: Kubona kubhala ngesandla (Handwriting recognition)** - While Al can do many things, handwriting recognition isn't explicitly mentioned in the passage.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungemandla emuntfu lonemaphethini ekucabanga lagucukako?","The correct answer is **D: Khumbula emaphethini** (Remember patterns).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that people with convergent thinking ""can remember procedures, solve problems, and work with scientific testing."" Remembering procedures *is* remembering patterns.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bona timphedvulo letiningi letilungile enkingeni** (See many correct solutions to a problem) - Convergent thinking focuses on *one* best answer, not many.
*   **B: Sebentisa emasu lamasha enkingeni** (Use new strategies for a problem) - This is more characteristic of *divergent* thinking, which involves exploring many possibilities.
*   **C: Kutsatsa sikhatsi sabo kucazulula inkinga** (Spend their time solving a problem) - While they may spend time, the passage doesn't highlight time spent as a *strength* of this thinking style, but rather the ability to efficiently apply known patterns.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungabukwa njengekugcila kwemcondvo wekucabanga logucukako?","The correct answer is **A: kuvisisa kutsi kunempendvulo leyodvwa lefanele** (understanding that there is only one correct answer).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sici lesimcokwa kakhulu salesimo sengcondvo ngulesi: kunemphendvulo yinye lengiyo mbamba."" (The most important characteristic of this mindset is this: there is only one correct answer.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kutsatsa sikhatsi semuntfu** (Wasting a person’s time) - The passage doesn’t mention anything about wasting time.
*   **C: Kukhomba emaciniso** (Pointing out truths) - While finding truth is *part* of critical thinking, the passage highlights the belief in *a single* correct answer as the defining characteristic.
*   **D: Kucoca lwati** (Clearing knowledge) - This is too general and doesn't capture the specific nature of rigid thinking described in the passage.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi lokulandzelako lokungeke kutsatfwe njenge kusho lokuncane?","The correct answer is **B: Uvula butjoki**. 

Here's why:

The passage focuses on micro-expressions – subtle facial cues that reveal emotions. It mentions things like fleeting facial expressions, and the ability to detect deception through facial analysis. Let's break down why the other options *are* related to micro-expressions, and why ""uvula butjoki"" (opening the mouth) isn't:

*   **A: Ubuke khashane ngalesikhatsi ukhuluma (Looking quickly while speaking):** This relates to observing someone's face *during* speech, which is central to detecting micro-expressions.
*   **C: Kucwabita ngekushesha (Flickering quickly):**  Micro-expressions are *fast* and fleeting, meaning they ""flicker"" across the face.
*   **D: Kuphakamisa sitfupha (Raising an eyebrow):**  Eyebrow movements are a common component of micro-expressions.

*   **B: Uvula butjoki (Opening the mouth):** While people open their mouths when speaking, this in itself isn’t necessarily a sign of deception or a specific micro-expression. It's a general action of speech, not a subtle facial cue revealing emotion.



Therefore, opening the mouth is the least likely to be considered a micro-expression as described in the passage."
Ngutiphi titatimende letilandzelako mayelana nekutoliga kwe-micro-expression lokungasilo liciniso?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuhumusha lokulungile kungahle kubone kucamba emanga.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ngalokucondzile, itsi umuntfu angakhona kubona nangabe lotsite acamba emanga ngekubuka simo sakhe sebuso."" (Currently, it says a person can tell if someone is lying by looking at their facial expression.) This directly relates to decoding micro-expressions to detect deception.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kucoshwa kwemavidiyo kuholele entuthukweni lenkhulu** - While the passage mentions video recording, it focuses on *interpreting* the video, not the act of recording itself being a large development.
* **C: Inkhulumo kanye nesimo sebuso kuyatoliga** - The passage highlights the ability to *interpret* facial expressions even when speech is impaired (referencing Olive Sacks' work). It doesn't say speech and facial expressions are being interpreted together.
* **D: Kungasite kuhlola bucotho** - This is a general statement. While true, it's not the *main* point of the passage regarding micro-expressions and deception. The passage focuses on *how* micro-expressions can help detect lies.

Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokwabaluleka kakhulu ngenca ye-Renaissance? ,"The correct answer is **B: Kujikeletisa lwati (Sharing of knowledge)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sikhatsi sengucuko sente lushintjo lolubalulekile endleleni yekufundza kanye nasekusabalaliseni lwati."" (The Renaissance brought a significant change in the way of learning and *disseminating knowledge*.)

This directly highlights the importance of knowledge being *shared* as the key shift brought about by the Renaissance. The passage contrasts the previous system (knowledge held primarily in individual memory) with the new system enabled by the Renaissance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Inkhumbulo yemuntfu ngamunye (Individual memory):** The passage argues the Renaissance *moved away* from relying solely on individual memory.
* **C: Khumbula umbhalo (Remembering text):**  While remembering text is part of learning, the Renaissance was about more than just memorization. It was about wider access and dissemination.
* **D: Kutfola umniningwane (Obtaining information):** Obtaining information is general, but the passage focuses on what happened *after* information was obtained – its spread.



"
"Njengemphumela we-Renaissance, ngukuphi lokwagcizelelwa kancane kulokulandzelako?","The correct answer is **A: Inkhumbulo yemuntfu ngamunye (Individual memory)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that *before* the Renaissance, knowledge was primarily held within an individual's memory. The Renaissance brought a significant change to how knowledge was learned and disseminated.  This implies that the reliance on individual memory *decreased* as other methods of storing and spreading knowledge developed (like writing and printing).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kutfola lwati (Acquiring knowledge):** The Renaissance *increased* the acquisition of knowledge.
*   **C: Khumbula umbhalo (Remembering texts):** While remembering texts was important, the Renaissance moved beyond *just* memorizing to analyzing and building upon existing texts.
*   **D: Kusakatwa kwelwati (Dissemination of knowledge):** The Renaissance *promoted* the spread of knowledge.

Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakhombisi lugcozi lekusebentisa i-inthanethi kute uchubeke nebudlelwane?,"The passage highlights that people are drawn to the internet for things like learning, entertainment, social interaction (""socializing""), and forming ongoing relationships. 

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: Kuchumana kwebhizinisi (Business networking)** - This *could* lead to ongoing relationships, as you build connections with colleagues.
* **B: Kuhlala uchumene nemndeni (Staying connected with family)** -  This directly aligns with the idea of ""ongoing relationships.""
* **C: Kucwaninga luhambo (Researching a trip)** - This is about *information gathering* and planning. While helpful, it doesn’t inherently focus on building or maintaining relationships.
* **D: Kuhlangana nebantfu labasha (Meeting new people)** - This is about *socializing*, which the passage identifies as a key draw to the internet.  It *could* lead to ongoing relationships.

Therefore, the answer that *least* demonstrates a desire to maintain ongoing relationships is **C: Kucwaninga luhambo (Researching a trip)**. It's a transactional activity, not a relational one.



**Final Answer: C**"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakhombisa lugcizi lekusebentisa i-inthanethi kute ubambe luchaza lesicu semuntfu?,"The correct answer is **C: Kucwaninga ngemkhicito wekunakekelwa kwwtemphilo (Researching healthcare information)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses motivations for using the internet, specifically mentioning ""learning"" and finding things ""enjoyable.""  Researching healthcare information aligns directly with *learning* – seeking knowledge to improve one's well-being.  It's a practical application of the internet that addresses a personal need, fitting the passage's description of both individual and communal uses of the internet.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Ngifuna irisiphi (What recipe do I want?)** - While finding a recipe *could* be enjoyable, it's a very specific and limited use case. It doesn't represent the broader motivations described in the text.
*   **B: Kutfumela ebhodini letingcoco letiku-inthanethi (Posting on online forums)** - This is about *interaction* which the passage mentions, but doesn't represent the individual need to *learn* or find something fulfilling.
*   **D: Kuphatsa timali (Managing finances)** - This is a practical task, but doesn't directly relate to the motivations of learning or enjoyment highlighted in the passage.

Inshonalanga ye-Europe iyekela nini kutsembela kakhulu ekucaleni futsi yacala kutfutfukisa sitayela sayo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngasekupheleni kwetikhatsi letiphakatsi** (At the end of the Middle Ages).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngasekupheleni kwesikhatsi lesibitwa ngekutsi iMiddle Ages intshonalanga yeYurophu yacala kutfutfukisa indlela yayo."" (At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ngesikhatsi saseByzantine** (During the Byzantine period) - The passage says Gothic style *initially* drew from Byzantine traditions, but it didn't begin Western Europe's independence *during* the Byzantine period.
*   **C: Cishe eminyakeni lengu-25 ngemuva kwesikhatsi lesiphakatsi** (About 25 years after the Middle Ages) - The passage states the delay was in the adoption of Western styles *from* the West, not the start of Western development.
*   **D: Phakatsi kwelikhulu leminyaka 11** (Between the 11th century) - The passage mentions a delay of 25-30 years in adopting styles, but doesn't say the development began *in* the 11th century. It was later, at the end of the Middle Ages.



"
Kusebentisa tinkinobho kute kuhlanganiswe tingubo kwaba ngumphumela wani? ,"The correct answer is **A: Sikhatsi seGothic**.

Here's why:

The passage states that during the later Middle Ages (which the Gothic period falls within), the use of buttons to fasten clothing was a development that contributed to the flourishing of Western European style. This directly links the use of buttons to the Gothic period.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Indzawo yaseByzantine:** The passage mentions Byzantine influence *early* in the Gothic period, but doesn't connect buttons to it.
*   **C: Tinkholo:** While faith played a role in the Middle Ages, the passage specifically links buttons to fashion/clothing development.
*   **D: Sikhatsi lesiphakatsi:** This is a general term and doesn't relate specifically to the development described in the passage.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokubonwa njengesicatululo lesisebentako sesikhatsi lesidze etindzabeni temvelo?","The correct answer is **C: Kukhomba imbangela yendzaba (Identifying the root cause of the problem)**.

Here's why:

The passage argues that simply treating the *symptoms* of environmental problems (like a temporary fix for an illness) isn't enough. It emphasizes the need to find the *source* of the problem (""umtfombo walenkinga"") and address that. This aligns directly with identifying the root cause of the issue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kwala kukhetsa indlela yekuphila lebukhatikhati (Choosing a sustainable lifestyle):** While the passage *mentions* living in harmony with nature, it doesn't present this as the *solution* to the immediate crisis, but rather a part of a larger approach.
* **B: Bushoshovu (Corruption):**  The passage doesn't directly mention corruption. It attributes the problems to science, professionalism, overpopulation, and disregard for life.
* **D: Kuba ngumfelandzawonye wenhlangano yetemvelo (Being a member of an environmental organization):**  Joining an organization is presented as a way to *help* with the problem, but not the core solution itself.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngusiphi kuleticatululo letilandzelako lesingeke sitsatfwe njenge kulashwa lokutimphawu tetindzaba temvelo?","The correct answer is **C: Kuveta imibono mayelana nekukhetsa lokubukhatikhati yekuphila**.

Here's why:

The passage argues against simply treating symptoms (like the effects of environmental problems) and emphasizes the need to find and *remove the root cause*. It compares this to treating a serious illness – you don't just manage the symptoms, you find the source of the disease.

Let's look at why the other options *are* aligned with the passage's ideas:

*   **A: Kutibandzakanya emsebentini (Getting involved in work)** - The passage suggests joining and working with organizations focused on environmental restoration, which is direct involvement/work.
*   **B: Kuvala timbangela tetinkinga (Closing the causes of problems)** - This directly reflects the passage's argument about finding and removing the *source* of the problem.
*   **D: Kuphila ngendlela levumelana nemvelo (Living in a way that aligns with nature)** -  The passage starts by stating the importance of living in harmony with nature.

Option C, however, is about *having opinions* on lifestyles. While important, the passage isn’t focused on debating choices; it’s focused on *action* to fix the underlying issues causing environmental damage. It's a preliminary step that doesn't directly address the core issue of treating the root cause, making it the least aligned with the text’s main point.

Beyikuliphi live impi yekucala e-Europe lebekutsiwa indzaba yayo leyinhloko ihlobene nekulinganisela kwemandla kunekutsi ibe nekonga kwenkholo?,"The correct answer is **D: E-Spain**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Impi yekutsi ngubani labefanele kubusa leyaliwa Spain yaba yimpi yekucala lebe umgomo wayo kukukhombisa kutsi ngubani lonemandla."" This directly translates to ""The war over who should rule the land of Spain was the first war whose goal was to show who was powerful.""  Therefore, the first war focused on a balance of power was about Spain.



"
Nguyiphi impi lechazwa ngekutsi impi yenkholo yekugcina ngalesinye sikhatsi?,"The correct answer is **A: Imphi Yeminyaka Lemashumi Lamatsatfu**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ngako leMphi Yeminyaka Lengemashumi Lamatsatfu beyitawuba yekugcina kutsi ibitwe ngekutsi yimphi yenkholo."" (Therefore, the Thirty Years' War was the last to be called a religious war)."
Nguyiphu kuletici letilandzelako telisontfo lemaCatholic lebeyingahlolisiswa?,"The correct answer is **C: Kuhlangana kwemandla ngekhatsi kwelisontfo** (The concentration of power within the church).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the church held immense power, influencing everyone from royalty to commoners. It also mentions that the focus on power and wealth led many to question whether the original principles were being upheld. This points directly to a concern about the *accumulation* of power within the Catholic Church as a focal point of scrutiny.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uma lokwabiwe kwemcebo phakatsi ebandleni kufanelekile** (Whether the distribution of wealth within the church was appropriate) - While wealth is mentioned, the passage focuses more on the *power* that came with it, and the doubts about whether principles were being followed.
*   **B: Uma timiso letiyinhloko yenkholo kufanele tichibiyelwe** (Whether the core principles of the faith should be revised) - The passage implies the principles *were* being questioned, not whether they *should* be revised. The issue was adherence to the existing principles.
*   **D: Kube bekuhlangabetwana netimfundziso letisemcoka telisontfo** (Whether there was a conflict with the essential teachings of the church) - Similar to B, the passage points to a questioning of whether the church was *following* its teachings, not a debate about the teachings themselves.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubani lowabulawa eVersailles?","The correct answer is **D: Umgadi**.

The text states: ""Kulesinye sigaba lilunga lalesicumbi liphakamise inhloko yanogadza wasebukhosini lobulewe eVarsailles phambi kweNdlovukati lebeyitfukile."" This translates to ""At one point a member of the crowd raised the head of a gardener killed at Versailles before the frightened Queen.""
"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakaphocwa sicuku eNkosini naseNdlovukatini?,"The correct answer is **A: Kuvulwa kwemafasitelo encola yabo (The opening of their prison windows)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states the crowd *demanded* the King and Queen open the bars of their prison (represented by ""emafasitelo encola yabo""). This was a direct and shocking act of defiance towards the monarchy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kuphuma lokungakalindzelelki eVersailles (Unexpected departure from Versailles):** This happened, but it wasn't a specific act of disrespect *to* the King and Queen, it was the event that led to the disrespect.
*   **C: Kubuka kwekujutjwa kwenhloko yalogadako (Seeing the head of the murdered guard):** While horrifying, this was done *to* the Queen, but the core of the disrespectful act was the demand and demonstration of power over them.
*   **D: Luhambo lolubuyela eParis (The return trip to Paris):** This was the journey *during* which the disrespect took place, not the disrespect itself.

Here's why:

The passage states that the British blockade *broke* the established rules of international law (the ""traditional rules of the sea""). It didn't *create* disruptions to the rules of the sea, it violated them.  The other options are all explicitly mentioned as consequences of the blockade:

*   **A:** Germany responded with similar tactics (submarine warfare).
*   **B:** Ships were wrecked by mines.
*   **D:** Essential goods became unavailable.

Therefore, option C is the one thing the passage doesn't describe as a result of the British action, but rather as something the British action *disrupted*."
Ngusiphi sitatimende lesingakuchazi kahle kuvinjwa kwemikhumbi yempi yase-Britain ngalokumelene neJalimani?,"The correct answer is **A: Kuphambane nemtsetfo wemave wonkhe** (It violated international law).

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states the blockade ""broke the established rules of international law compiled over decades through various treaties."" This is the most direct and accurate description of the British action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kwabangela impi yemikhumbi-ngwenya faseJalimani** (It caused a German submarine war) - While the passage hints at a German response involving submarines, it doesn't state this was *caused* by the blockade.  It says Germany *anticipated* responding in kind.
* **C: Kuphatamise kuhamba kwetimphahla taseJalimani** (It limited German trade) - While the blockade *would* have limited German trade, the passage focuses on the legal implications of the blockade itself, not its economic effects.
* **D: Kucinisekise kutsi imikhumbi ldngatsatsi hlangotsi angeke ibe engotini** (It ensured neutral ships would not be mined) -  The passage states the mines even endangered neutral ships (""nasemikhumbini lengaketi emphini""), contradicting this option.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, kungaba kwabani kucilongwa kwe-Multiple Sclerosis?","The correct answer is **A: Wesifazane loneminyaka lengu-32** (A woman aged 32).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lucwaningo lutfole kutsi bantfu besifazane besematfubeni lamakhulu ekuba ne-MS kunebantfu besilisa."" (Research has found that women in their 20s and 30s are more likely to have MS than men.)
* **Option A** fits this description – a woman in her 30s.
* **Options B, C, and D** don't align with the passage's information about who is most likely to be affected. Option B is too young, Option C is older than the typically affected age range mentioned, and Option D is too young.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, bahlanganyeli emisebentini levamile bebadzinga kusekelwa lokungetiwe kwani?","The correct answer is **A: Umbono lomubi webuhlungu** (A negative perception of pain).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Labo labatsatsa ingcenye njalo emisebentini badzinga kusekelwa njalo nakutiwa endleleni yekuva buhlungu lengeyinhle kuhlukanisa umehluko webuhlungu lobungemahlala khona kanye nekungativa kahle ekushukumiseleni umtimba ngalokuvamile.""

This translates to: ""Those who participate regularly in activities need support to learn how to experience pain in a healthy way, to differentiate between normal pain and pain that prevents them from moving their bodies normally.""

This means they needed support specifically regarding their *perception* and *understanding* of pain – a negative or unhelpful view of pain was hindering their recovery and ability to function.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Umhlane longentasi** (Shoulder tension) - While shoulder pain is mentioned in the context of broader pain, it's not the specific reason they needed support.
*   **C: Kucindzeteleka** (Anxiety) - Anxiety is mentioned as a factor, but the need for support relates to understanding pain, not just anxiety itself.
*   **D: Kusaba** (Fear) - Similar to anxiety, fear is a component, but the core need is for help navigating their experience of pain.



"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, kubiya kuvame kudlalwa njani?","The correct answer is **D: Ngefomethi ye-duel**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Lomdlalo ngalokuyinhloko udlalwa bantfu lababili, lomunye adlale nalomunye"" which translates to ""The game is mainly played by two people, one playing against the other."" This directly describes a duel or one-on-one format.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngefomathi yesimanje (In modern format):** While the game *is* modern, the passage doesn't specifically highlight that as how it's commonly played.
*   **B: Ezingeni lenyuvesi (At university level):**  The passage mentions universities as *a* place it's played, but not as the *common* way it's played.
*   **C: Ezingeni lema-Olympic (At Olympic level):**  The passage mentions the Olympics, but also emphasizes it’s played by individuals, not as a team sport within the Olympics.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kwalokulandzelako lokungaba inkhomba lenemandla yebutsi baphakatsi?","The correct answer is **C: Emajacamba lamatima kanye nebuhlungu besiso** (Severe rashes and body aches).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Inkomba lekahle kakhulu yekutsi udle shevu kungaba kutfolakala kwesigubhu lesivuliwe semutsi noma ikhemikhali yasekhaya lenebutsi."" (The best indication that you have been poisoned could be finding an open container of liquid or a household chemical with a smell.) While that's a direct sign, the text *also* implies symptoms.  Severe rashes and body aches would be a common reaction to poisoning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sicanucanu nemkhuhlane** (Sneezing and coughing) - These are typical cold/allergy symptoms, not necessarily poisoning.
*   **B: Kuphalaza nekujuluka** (Dizziness and weakness) -  While these *could* be symptoms, they are very general and could have many causes.
*   **D: Libhodlela leliphilisi ladokotela** (A bottle of medicine from a doctor) - This indicates *treatment*, not poisoning.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngusiphi sinyatselo sekucala lesifanele uma uhlola sisulu?","The correct answer is **C: Buka simo salohlukubetekile**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nafufuna kusita lomuntfu losenkhingeni kufanele ucale uhlolisise lendzawo lakwenteke khona lengoti kuze ucinisekise kuphepha kwakho. Kufanele ubone **kutsi lesisulu sime njani** njengoba usondzela kuso netintfo letingasitfusa."" 

This directly translates to needing to **see the condition of the victim** as the first step.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Buka lesimo** - Too general. While you assess the *situation*, the first specific action is observing the victim.
*   **B: Sondzela lohlukubetekile** - Approaching the victim is mentioned *after* observing their condition.
*   **D: Lindza lusito** - Protecting yourself is important, but not the first action to take when assessing a victim.



"
Ngusiphi sitatimende kuletilandzelako lesingakhombisa ngalokungiko inchobo yekuhlola sisulu?,"The correct answer is **B: Hlola Indzawo yesigameko ngaphambi kwalojlukumetekile**.

**Here's why:**

The passage specifically states: ""Nawufuna kusita lomuntfu losenkhingeni kufanele ucale uhlolisise lendzawo lakwenteke khona lengoti kuze ucinisekise kuphepha kwakho.""  This directly translates to ""If you want to help someone in danger, you should first assess the scene to ensure your own safety.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ungakhatsateki ngekutilimata wena** (Don't worry about hurting yourself) - While safety is important, this isn't the *first* step mentioned.
*   **C: Buka sikhundla salohlukumetekile** (Look at the position of the victim) - The passage mentions observing the victim, but *after* assessing the scene.
*   **D: Zama kucaphela noma nguyiphi imijeko** (Try to identify any hazards) - Identifying hazards is *part* of assessing the scene, but 'B' is the more comprehensive answer.



"
Ngutiphi tingucuko letibangwe Ingucuko yaseFrance yaba nemtsetfo lomkhulu kutakhamuti setigaba setisebenti?,"The correct answer is **D: Luhlelo lolusha lokulinganisa** (A new system of measurement - the metric system).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically mentions the implementation of the metric system as a key change.** It highlights how it moved away from arbitrary standards to a standardized, rational system.
* **The passage also discusses changes in military and civil service based on merit (performance),** reflecting a broader shift towards a system based on quantifiable factors – aligning with the spirit of the metric system.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Kuseka lokungetiwe kwesive (Establishment of a constitutional monarchy):** While the French Revolution *eventually* led towards constitutionalism, the passage doesn't focus on this as a primary outcome.
* **B: Kushintja kwekugcila esigabeni kuya ekhonweni (Shift from estate to individual):** This is *part* of the revolution’s impact, but not the direct focus of the excerpt's discussion about the metric system and merit-based systems.
* **C: Kuguculwa kwemibono yeRepublic (Circulation of Republican ideas):**  Again, a consequence of the revolution, but not the specific detail addressed in the passage regarding practical changes.



Therefore, the passage's emphasis on the metric system as a concrete example of rationalization and standardization makes **D** the most accurate answer."
"Ngemuva kwengucuko yaseFrance, kuphumelela kwetimpi nakuleminye imisebenti bekungahle kusekelwe kuphi?","The correct answer is **D: Lizinga (Level/Merit)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ngemuva Kwetingucuko imisebenti yavuleka kubo bonkhe besilisa labafaka ticelo kuze labo labafuna kuphumelela baphumelele.""  and ""esikhundleni sekutsi emasotja emphi abekwe esigabeni lesitsite ngesigaba sawo manje sekabekwa ngekwelizinga lemsebenti wawo."" This directly translates to jobs and military positions being open to all who apply *based on their merit/level of skill* rather than birthright or social standing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Impumelelo (Success)** - While people *aimed* for success, the system wasn't based on past success, but on the ability to perform.
*   **B: Likilasi (Class)** - The revolution aimed to *break down* class barriers, not reinforce them.
*   **C: Kulangatelela (Favoritism)** - The new system sought to eliminate favoritism and promote fairness.



"
Nguyiphi inkondzo yemphakatsi lekutsiwa ibanga kunganeliseki kakhulu emaveni latfutfukile?,"The correct answer is **A: Lizinga lemanti (Water quality)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Emaveni latfutfukile kuyimvela kancane kutsi uve kukhononwa ngemanti langekho ezingeni lelikahle..."" (In rural areas, it is common to get sick from water that is not of good quality...). This directly links poor water quality to illness in rural communities.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Kwakhiwa kwelibhuloho (Road construction):** While road construction is mentioned as a potential source of discomfort, it's not directly linked to widespread sickness like water quality is.
* **C: Tekutfutsa temphakatsi (Community funding):** Funding issues aren't directly mentioned as causing illness.
* **D: Imfundvo (Education):** Education is important, but the passage focuses on *physical* health problems stemming from infrastructure issues.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini lengashiwo mayelana netinhlelo tetekutfutsa temphakatsi?","The correct answer is **C: Tibanga tikhalo letiningi ngalabo labatisebentisako** (They cause a lot of complaints for those who use them).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...cishe bonkhe bantfu bayakhonona ngetintfo tekuhamba temphakatsi."" (almost everyone complains about public transportation). It also points out issues like poor water quality and potholes, implying frequent problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Titsandvwa kakhulu nguwo wonkhe umuntfu lotisebentisako** (They are very loved by everyone who uses them) - This is the *opposite* of what the passage says.
* **B: Atisitibi njenge lizinga lemanti** (It's not stable like water quality) - While the passage *mentions* water quality as an example of a problem, it doesn't say the transport system itself is unstable.
* **D: Tikhululekile emaveni lamaningi latfutfukile** (They are comfortable in many developed areas) - The passage suggests the opposite; problems are *more* common in developed areas (""emaveni latfutfukile"").

"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungaba matima kukukala ngenca yekungabikeki kwebashayeli?","The correct answer is **D: Kuhamba kwesiminyeminye (Traffic flow)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kodvwa-ke, kudadisha kuhamba kwetimoto kulikhuni ngoba lokwentiwa bashayeli ngeke sekucombakaleke ngekukholwa lokuphelele."" This directly translates to: ""However, studying traffic flow is difficult because what drivers do cannot always be predicted with complete certainty.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sivinini sesiminyeminye (Speed of traffic):** While speed *contributes* to traffic flow, the passage doesn't say speed itself is difficult to measure due to unpredictability.
*   **B: Kuhlela Umgwaco (Road Planning):** The passage states these behaviors *help* in road planning, not make it difficult.
*   **C: Imisebenti yemgwaco (Road work):**  This isn't mentioned as being directly affected by driver unpredictability in the passage.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokusebentiswa umele kusakatwa kwekuphitsitela kwetimoto ngetibalo?,"The correct answer is **C: Umklamo wemgwaco (Road Design)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the observed driver behaviors (following, spacing, and speed) ""help in the planning, construction, and operation of roads.""  This directly relates to *road design*.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Imisebenti yemgwaco (Road Works/Maintenance):** While understanding traffic flow is *useful* for road works, the passage focuses on how this understanding *influences the initial design*.
* **B: Kutiphatsa kwemshayeli (Driver Behavior):**  The passage *describes* driver behavior, but the point isn't to study the behavior itself, but how it informs road design.
* **D: Kuminyana kwetimoto (Vehicle Density):** Vehicle density is a *result* of traffic flow, not the primary application of studying it as described in the text.



"
Hershey naChase basebentise ini kufaka i-DNA yabo? ,"The correct answer is **D: Emagciwane**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hershey and Chase used viruses called phages, or bacteria, to infect bacteria."" They used these viruses (phages/bacteria) to deliver their DNA into the bacteria.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Radioactive phosphorus:** While they *used* radioactive phosphorus in one of their experiments to track DNA, it wasn't what they used to *deliver* the DNA.
*   **B: Takhi telufuto (Fatty acids):** This isn't mentioned in the text and isn't relevant to how Hershey and Chase conducted their experiment.
*   **C: Sibabuli se-Radioactive (Radioactive tracer):** This is a component of their method, but not what they used to *introduce* the DNA.



"
Lukhono lekugucula takhi telufuto tindlulele entalweni lencike kuphi?,"The correct answer is **C: Luhlobo lekugucuka (Type of mutation)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the effects of a mutation depend on *the type of mutation*.  It differentiates between mutations in germ-line cells (which are heritable) and other mutations (which might cause cell death or cancer).  The ability of a mutation to be passed down hinges on *what kind* of mutation it is.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uma emaseli ayi-germ-line (If the cells are germ-line):** While germ-line mutations *are* heritable, the passage says the effects *depend on the type*, not just whether it's in a germ-line cell.
*   **B: Kubaluleka katakhi telufuto (Importance of the genome structure):** The passage doesn’t focus on the structure of the genome itself, but the *changes* within it.
*   **D: Uma kugucuka kungabangela kufa kweseli (If the mutation causes cell death):** This is a *possible* effect of a mutation, but it doesn’t determine the overall capability of a mutation to be passed on.



"
"Ngalokusekelwe elwatini lolunikelwe endzimeni, yini imiphumela lehlukahlukene yekugucuka kwetakhi telufuto lekungakancikwa kulo?","The correct answer is **B: Uma emaseli atsintsekile yi-germ-line**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kugucuka kwesimo lokusetinhlayiyeni ema-germ-line kungadluliselwa kubantfwana, kepha kugucuka kwesimo lokunye kungabangela kufa kwetinhlayiya noma umdlavuza."" This directly highlights that *whether* the affected cells are germ-line cells (passed to offspring) or not dramatically changes the outcomes of a genetic mutation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tingakanani takhi telufuto letitsintsekako** - The passage doesn't discuss the *size* or quantity of mutations.
*   **C: Kubaluleka kwetintfo telufuto letitsintsekile** - While importance is mentioned, the passage focuses on *different* outcomes based on germ-line status, not overall importance.
*   **D: Luhlobo lekugucugucuka lokutsintsekile** - The passage mentions different *effects* of mutations, but doesn't delve into different *types* of mutations themselves.

Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lobekungasiso sizathu sekutsi emasiko akudzala afuye timbuti?,"The correct answer is **D: Tiniketa lithuba lekutfola inyama** (They provide the opportunity to obtain meat).

Here's why:

The text specifically states that early pastoralism (herding) allowed people to easily obtain ""inyama"" (meat), as well as milk, wool, and hides.  While live livestock (B) were important, the primary driver for domesticating goats was the reliable source of food – meat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tiniketa lithuba lekudla inyama** (They provide the opportunity to eat meat) - This is very similar to D, but ""obtain"" is more encompassing - you obtain the meat *then* eat it.
*   **C: Titsembisa bungani** (They promise companionship) - The text doesn't mention companionship as a reason for herding goats.
*   **B: Tisita ekuluseni live** (They help with milking livestock) -  Milk was a benefit, but not the initial *reason* for domestication.



"
Umgomo wegalufu kutsatsa linani lelincane lani?,"The correct answer is **B: Ema-Stokes**.

Here's why:

The text states players try to complete the course in the *fewest strokes* (""Umdlali lojikijela tikhatsi letimbalwa kulekilabhu kuze acedze lomdlalo uyaphumelela"").  ""Strokes"" in golf refers to the number of times a player hits the ball.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Emabhola (Balls):** While balls are *used* in golf, the goal isn't to hit a certain number of balls, but to complete the course efficiently.
*   **C: Sikhatsi (Time):** While speed is a factor for professional golfers, the primary goal isn't to finish the fastest.
*   **D: Timbobo (Holes):** Completing the holes is the *way* to win, but the goal is to do so with the fewest strokes.



"
"Ebaleni legalufu, bukuphi tjani lobujutjwe bafinyetwa?","The correct answer is **B: Lapho kuluhlata khona**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...nalotjani emaceleni alesigodzi uhhulwa ube mncane futsi ubutwa ngekutsi luhlata."" This translates to ""...and the hole on the side of the goal is made small and covered with grass.""  Therefore, the holes are covered with grass, meaning that's where the balls are aimed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Embobeni yelishumi nesiphohlongo (In the 18th hole):** While the text mentions the 18th hole as the finishing point, it doesn't say balls are *put* there.
*   **C: Embobeni yekucala (In the first hole):** The text states players *start* at the first hole, not that balls are put there.
*   **D: Encenyeni yekucala yendlela (At the beginning of the path):** This isn't mentioned in the text.



"
Nguyiphi inhloso yekuhlola levamile?,"The correct answer is **A: Kucedza inkholelo-mbono leyodvwa noma ngetulu lokungenteka** (To test a single or multiple hypotheses).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that experimentation is a way to *eliminate false beliefs*. This directly aligns with testing hypotheses (inkholelo-mbono) to see if they hold true. 

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Kute utfole kutsi umhlaba usebenta njani** (To find out how the world works) - While experimentation *contributes* to understanding how the world works, its immediate goal is to test specific ideas, not to discover everything at once.
* **C: Kubuta imibuto** (To ask questions) - Experimentation follows questioning; it doesn't *do* the questioning itself.
* **D: Kucondzisa lucwaningo lesayensi** (To conduct scientific research) - Experimentation is *part* of scientific research, but it's not the overall purpose of the research itself.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini lengasiti kucondzisa lucwaningo lesayensi?","The correct answer is **C: Kucedza imibono lengenteka** (Eliminating false beliefs).

Here's why:

The passage states that investigation (or research) is one way to *remove false beliefs* and helps scientists understand *how things happen*. This directly relates to testing and discarding incorrect ideas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Indlela yesayensi yodvwa** (One scientific method) - While the scientific method is important, the passage focuses on the *purpose* of research, not just the method itself.
*   **B: Kwenta imibono** (Creating ideas) - Research doesn't just create ideas; it tests and refines them.
*   **D: Kwenta tivivinyo** (Doing experiments) - Experiments are *part* of research, but the passage emphasizes what research *achieves* – getting rid of false beliefs.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngusiphi sitatimende lesingasilo liciniso mayelana nema-tornado?","The correct answer is **C: Ema-tornado kamaningi atsatsa emahora lamatsatfu**.

Here's why:

The text states that *powerful* tornadoes can last for *over* three hours. It **doesn't** say that *most* tornadoes last for three hours. In fact, the beginning of the passage implies smaller tornadoes don't last as long.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

*   **A: Ema-tornado ayakwati kucekela phasi yonkhe intfo lesedvute kwawo** – The text states they can damage everything in their path (""destroy everything in their path"").
*   **B: Ema-tornado ahlasela tindzawo letincane kunaletinye tiphepho** – The first sentence directly says this: ""Small tornadoes attack smaller areas compared to hurricanes.""
*   **D: Lamanye ema-tornado angaba nemoya lofinyelela ku-300 emamayela ngelihora** – The text gives an example of a tornado with winds of 300 mph.



"
"Ngalokusekelwe kulendzima, ngitiphi tinkhulumo kuleti letilandzelako letichaza ngalokungiko liningi letiphepho?","The correct answer is **B: Takha moya cishe emamayela langu-480 ngelihora**

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states: ""Lesiphepho besinemoya lobowugijima nga-480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph)."" This translates directly to ""The wind in the tornado was traveling at 480 kilometers per hour."" Option B is the closest equivalent in the provided choices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tivame kuhlala emahora langetulu kulamatsatfu** - The passage mentions strong tornadoes lasting *over* three hours, but doesn't say they *always* do.
*   **C: Titsintsa tindzawo letikhulu kunaletinye yiphepho** - The passage says smaller tornadoes are less powerful, but doesn't mention they cover larger areas.
*   **D: Tiyakhona kudzabula tihlahla phasi** - While tornadoes *can* uproot trees, the passage describes them *breaking* trees with their winds, not necessarily uprooting them.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako labacale kukwenta bantfu eminyakeni lengu-16 ekhulwini?,"The correct answer is **A: Sebentisa ma-lens** (Using lenses).

Here's why:

The passage states the first microscopes were built in Europe in the 16th century *and* that they had two lenses which made things appear closer and larger. The question asks what people started *doing* in the 16th century related to this.  Using lenses is the direct action enabled by the invention.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tintfo thekukhulisa** (Things to magnify) - This is a *result* of using lenses, not the action itself.
* **C: Kwenta ma-lens** (Making lenses) - While someone had to *make* the lenses, the passage doesn't say this is what became common for people to do. It focuses on the *use* of lenses.
* **D: Kwenta tibonakudze** (Making microscopes) -  Again, this describes the creation of the tool, not the action people took with it.



"
Kunini bantfu bakhulisa tintfo basebentisa emalensi?,"The correct answer is **B: Kusukela ngasekupheleni kweminyaka lengu-16 ekhulwini** (Since the late 16th century).

Here's why:

The passage states that the first spectacles were *made in Europe by the end of the 16th century*.  This directly answers the question of *when* people started using lenses to improve vision.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uminyaka leyinkulungwane** (A thousand years) - The passage doesn't mention using lenses for a thousand years.
*   **C: Iminyaka leyitinkulungwane** (Thousands of years) - Similar to A, the passage doesn't suggest this long of a history with lens use.
*   **D: Kusukela ekucaleni kweminyaka lengu-16 ekhulwini** (Since the beginning of the 16th century) - The passage specifically says *end* of the 16th century.

"Ngalokusekelwe kulendzima, utsini umhume waMuhammad mayelana nemikhuba noma tindzinganiso takhe letingekwemoya?","The correct answer is **A: Kwayisa kuthula nekutihlukanisa** (It offered peace and isolation).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states Muhammad would go to the cave (""Hira"") to *think* (cabanga).** This implies a need for quiet contemplation.
* **It describes the cave as a place of solitude:** ""Kute lokubonakalako ngaphandle kwesibhakabhaka lesisetulu lesicacile, futsi lesihle naletintsaba letinengi letitungeletile. Lokuncane kakhulu kwalomhlaba kungabonakala nobe kuviwe ngekhatsi kwalomhume."" (There is nothing to see except the clear upper sky, and beautiful with these many arranged mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard in this cave.) This emphasizes the isolation.
* **The cave gave him a ""clear picture of Muhammad as a spiritual person"" (sitfombe lesicacile saMuhammad sekuba ngumuntfu wakamoya).** This suggests the environment fostered spiritual growth, which would be aided by peace and quiet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umsindvo wangaphandle ungasita kucabangela (The outside environment can help with thinking):** The passage suggests the *opposite* - he sought isolation *from* the outside world.
* **C: Bekadzinga sikhatsi lesincane kakhulu kuba yedvwa (He needed very little time to be alone):** The passage doesn't mention how long he needed to be alone, only that he frequently went to the cave.
* **D: Bekajake kubukwa nekuvakala (He wanted to be seen and heard):**  The description of the cave specifically points to its remoteness and the lack of visible/audible distractions.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini leyasebentiswa insimbi kwekucala?","The correct answer is **C: Emasondvo**.

The passage states: ""Ngekuhamba kwesikhatsi, emasondvo lakhiwe ngelikhuni atsatselwa indzawo ngulawo lakhiwe ngensimbi. Nga-1767, bonkhe bojantji besitimela bakhiwa ngensimbi.""  This translates to: ""Over time, wooden crossings were replaced by those made of iron. By 1767, all railway crossings were made of iron.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tiphambano (Rails):** The passage doesn't mention rails being the first thing made of iron.
*   **B: Indlela yetincola (Railway track):** While the track eventually used iron, the passage specifically says *crossings* were the first to be made of iron.
*   **D: Tipolo (Wheels):** The passage doesn't mention wheels being made of iron first.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kungani emasondvo esigodvo atsatselwa masondvo ensimbi?","The correct answer is **D: Bebagcitjwa yinsimbi kujantji**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngekuhamba kwesikhatsi, emasondvo lakhiwe ngelikhuni atsatselwa indzawo ngulawo lakhiwe ngensimbi. Nga-1767, bonkhe bojantji besitimela bakhiwa ngensimbi.""  This directly translates to: ""Over time, wooden rails were replaced by iron rails. By 1767, all train tracks were made of iron.""

This means the wooden rails were *replaced* by iron rails – the iron rails were preferred and used more frequently.  While iron rails might have allowed for heavier loads (option C), the text specifically states they *replaced* the wooden ones. Options A and B aren't mentioned in the text.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubaphi bantfu labalolongekile emkhatsini nemkhatsi we-Romanticism?","The correct answer is **D: Lisiko** (Tradition).

Here's why:

The passage states that the text is about a tradition that opposes strict rules, and specifically mentions Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel – all key figures in the Romanticism movement.  Romanticism valued feeling and individual expression *over* rigid traditions and rules. The passage directly connects the discussed ""tindzaba"" (stories/traditions) to Romanticism and its opposition to forced rules.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Imitsetfo** (Rules) - The passage is *against* strict rules.
* **B: Umumo wemhlaba** (World structure) - This isn't the focus of the passage.
* **C: Ngekwetifiso** (By desire/preference) - While Romanticism valued individual desire, the passage focuses on the broader *tradition* itself.

Ngutiphi titatimende letilandzelako letingakhombisi umcondvo lojwayelekile wekuncuma kwetebuchwepheshe? ,"The correct answer is **B: Kutfutfukisa kwebuchwepheshe akubangwa lusiko** (Technological development is not shaped by culture).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that technological development *follows* culture and political powers (""futsi kutfutfukiswa kwebuchwephesha kulandzela indlela lengenhla kwemasiko nemandla epolitiki"").  Option B directly contradicts this core idea.

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with the passage:

*   **A: Imiphumela yebuchwephesha emphakatsini ihambisana nenhlalo** (The effects of technology on society are social) - The entire passage revolves around how technology interacts with and shapes society, so this aligns with the text.
*   **C: Buchwepheshae bunemiphumela lengekwemvelo emphakatsini** (Technology has unintended consequences on society) - The example of roads and cars illustrates this - building roads for cars then leads to more car accidents and the need for medical technology.
*   **D: Intutfuko yetebuchwepheshe ayisekelwe ngekwentiswa tembusave** (Technological development is not based on simple cause and effect) - The passage uses the car/road example to show that technological development is complex and has feedback loops.  The initial ""cause"" (cars) leads to a new ""effect"" (road networks) that then influences further development (cheaper cars, medical advances).



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi lokulandzelako lokungakahlangani nekudonsa umnsalo?","The correct answer is **A: Umsindvo lopholile (A light sound)**.

Here's why:

The passage explains that a high-pitched instrument makes a *light* sound (""umsindvo lolula"") and a low-pitched instrument makes a *strong* sound (""umsindvo lonamandla"").  The other options are directly mentioned as being related to bowing technique:

* **B: Luphawu lolubukeka njengesisekelo (A shape resembling a base)** - This describes the ""down bow.""
* **C: Umsindvo lonemandla (A strong sound)** - This is a result of the ""down bow.""
* **D: Icala esicocweni (The part on the frog)** - This is where you grip the bow and is part of the ""down bow"" explanation.

The passage doesn't directly link a *light* sound to a specific bowing technique, making it the one element not directly related to the described bowing actions.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi lokulandzelako lokuhlotjaniswa nemsindvo lopholile?","The correct answer is **C: Luphawu lolubukeka njenge V**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Limaki leliyi """"up bow"""" libukeka njenga-V bese kutsi """"limaki leliyi-down bow"""" lifanana nentfo lesisekelo noma lesikwele lesite incenye yaso lengaphansi."" This translates to: ""This 'up bow' mark looks like a V and this 'down bow' mark looks like a basic or square shape with only a portion of it below.""  It then goes on to say the higher string produces a lighter sound. Therefore, the V-shaped mark is associated with the lighter sound.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: liphawu lebutjoki loluphasi** - This refers to the bow mark in general, not specifically the light sound.
*   **B: Dvonsa butjoki** - This describes the *action* of a down bow, not the mark itself or the sound.
*   **D: Icala lapho sandla sakho sibambe khona butjoki** - This describes the location related to the down bow, not the light sound."
Tinsalela tematsambo tikhombisa kutsi tandla tagcina setitayele kusebentiswa ngalokuyinhloko kulokulandzelako?,"The correct answer is **B: Kutfwala sisindvo (Carrying weight)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sandla seshimpandzi nelunyawo kuyalingana ngebukhulu nebudze, kukhombisa lomsebenti walesandla kutfwala sisindvo uma ihamba."" (A chimpanzee's hand and foot are equal in size and length, indicating the hand's job of carrying weight when walking).  It also says human hands are *shorter* than feet, and fingers are *shorter* than toes, a change revealed by fossils over millions of years, indicating a shift *away* from weight-bearing on hands.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kukhwabanisa (Climbing):** While hominids likely climbed, the passage focuses on the shift *away* from using hands for locomotion, including climbing.
*   **C: Kuhamba (Walking):** The passage points out that hands *stopped* being primarily used for walking.
*   **D: Kuhamba ugucile (Knuckle-walking):** The passage doesn't mention knuckle-walking.



"
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokuchaza ngalokungiko ema-phalange emfene? ,"The correct answer is **A: Ticondzile kunebantfu’** (They are shorter than humans’).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sandla semuntfu sifisha kunelunyawo, netingalo leticondzile kunetetinyawo."" This directly translates to ""A human’s hand is shorter than their foot, and the fingers are shorter than the toes.""  This describes the phalanges (fingers/toes) being shorter in humans compared to other hominids like chimpanzees.

Let’s look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tandla netinyawo tato tiyahluka ngebukhulu** (Their hands and feet differ in size) – While true for humans as described, the passage focuses on *how* they differ (hand shorter than foot).
*   **C: Tisebentiselwa kutfwala sisindvo** (They are used to carry weight) – The passage says chimpanzee hands are used for carrying weight, not specifically phalanges.
*   **D: Tisebentiselwa ngalokuyinhloko yekukhohlisa** (They are primarily used for deception) – The passage does not mention any deception function.



"
Ukhetsa kususa kuhluka kwelufuto lolusha kuliphi licumbu?,"The correct answer is **D: Kuvetiwe** (Vetiwe - meaning ""derived"" or ""selected"").

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...lokukhetsa kuyakususa kulelicembu lekuhlukahlukana lokuvetiwe.""  This directly translates to ""...selection will remove from the derived variation group."" 

Therefore, selection acts *on* the derived variation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kufihliwe** (Fihliwe - meaning ""hidden"") - The passage speaks of hidden variation, but selection doesn't remove from the hidden group, it removes from the derived group.
* **B: Kuhlanganisa kabusha** (Kuhlanganisa kabusha - meaning ""recombination"") - Recombination contributes to variation, but it's not what selection *removes*.
* **C: Kuhlukaniswa** (Kuhlukaniswa - meaning ""separated"") - This doesn't fit the context of how selection operates.



"
Nguyiphi inchubo lenesibopho sekungeta kuhluka kwelufuto?,"The correct answer is **C: Kugucuka kwetakhi telufuto** (Fluctuations in the structure of the foot).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kugucuka kwesimo kungeta kuhlukahlukana kwelufuto..."" This translates to ""Fluctuations in condition contribute to the variation of the foot...""  This directly links fluctuations (changes) in the foot's structure to the differences observed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuhlukaniswa** (Separation) - While the passage mentions two groups, it doesn't say separation *causes* the variation.
* **B: Kuhlanganisa kabusha** (Reorganization) - Reorganization is a *result* of the differences, not the cause. The passage states it happens *after* the variation exists.
* **D: Kuvetiwe** (Derived/Developed) -  ""Derived"" refers to one type of foot structure, not the reason for variation.

"Ngekusekelwa elwatini lolusendzimeni, ngikuphi kuloku lokufanele inkawu ikudle kute icatulule “inkinga yemaprotheni”?","The correct answer is **A: Emacembe lafile (Dried maize/corn)**.

Here's why, based on the text:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Lebesingakhona kusheshe sikutfole etitjalweni ngumsoco losemacembeni kanye nakulokunjengabomabhontjisi..."" (We can easily get it from plants like maize and beans...) This indicates maize is a source of the necessary nutrients.
* **The passage also mentions:** ""...kepha kulukhuni kutsi kungahlafukeka kugayeke ngaphandle kwanakuphekiwe."" (…but it's difficult to digest without being cooked.)  This highlights a potential issue with *unprocessed* maize – it needs preparation to become digestible.  “Emacembe lafile” (dried maize) would be the unprocessed form.
* **The overall point of the passage** is about animals needing a complete amino acid profile, which is difficult to get from plants without proper processing. Maize, while containing the nutrients, needs cooking to be effectively utilized.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lokusanhlavu lokuluhlata (Ripe vegetables):** While nutritious, the text doesn't focus on vegetables as a solution to the protein issue.
* **C: Intsetse (Millet):**  Not specifically mentioned as a source in the passage.
* **D: Sici setimbali (Flower nectar):** Nectar is primarily sugar and not a source of protein/amino acids.

"Ngekusho kwendzima,nguyiphi kuletinkinga letilandzelako lengabangela kusweleka kwema-amino acid labalulekile?","The correct answer is **A: Tinkinga tekugaya kudla** (Problems with digestion).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the problem stems from animals *not being able to properly digest* plant matter to obtain the necessary amino acids. It says they lack the means to break down the food ""like humans"" to get those amino acids. The other options are *consequences* of the amino acid deficiency, not the root cause.

*   **B: Kungondleki kahle** (Not eating well) is a *result* of the deficiency.
*   **C: Kukhula lokungajabulisi** (Unhappy growth) is also a *result*.
*   **D: Kufa** (Death) is the ultimate *result* of prolonged deficiency.

Emalunga elusiko lelincane lelitsite ngalokuvamile akhombisa njani kuhlangana kwawo nelicembu?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngekusebentisa sitayela ngendlela yeluphawu** (By using style as a symbol).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Emalungu elisiko kaningi abonisa bulunga bawo ngekusebentisa tindlela netimphawu letihlukile tesitayela, lokufaka imfashini, kutiphatsa, nelulwimi lesigodzi."" (Members of a subculture often demonstrate their allegiance by using distinct styles and symbols, including fashion, behavior, and coded language.)

This directly supports the idea that members of a subculture (the smaller culture within the larger one) show their connection to the group through *style* and *symbols*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngekutama kuhlanganisa** (By simply associating) - While association is part of it, the passage emphasizes *how* they show association.
*   **B: Ngekwamukela tinkholelo tawo wonkhe umuntfu lobatungeletile** (By accepting everyone's beliefs) - Subcultures can have specific beliefs, but the passage focuses on *demonstrating* belonging, not just open acceptance.
*   **C: Ngekwamukela timiso temphakatsi** (By accepting societal norms) - Subcultures often *challenge* societal norms, not simply accept them.

"ngekwembono lovetiwe kulendzima, yini lengahle yenteke emntfwaneni lohlanganisa nelicembu lelincane lebuhlanga lelicabangwa kutsi lihileleke ekutiphatseni lokuyingoti?","The correct answer is **B: Umntfwana utoba nemathuba lamaningi kutsi ahileleke ekutiphatseni lokuyingoti** (The child will have a higher chance of participating in negative behavior).

Here's why:

The passage states that being discriminated against from a young age *shapes* how children behave.  If a child is part of a minority group that is *expected* to behave negatively, the constant negative association and potential internalizing of stereotypes increases the likelihood they will conform to that expectation.  It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umntfwana utotama kugwema kutibandzakanya ekutiphatseni lokuyingoti** (The child will try to avoid negative behavior) - While a child *might* try, the passage suggests the discrimination is powerful enough to *influence* their behavior, not necessarily avoid it.
* **C: Umntfwana utawuhoca etimeni temphakatsi** (The child will drop out of community activities) - The passage doesn't discuss community involvement.
* **D: Umntfwana utawala kuhlanganyela naletinye tinhlanga letincane** (The child will associate with other minority groups) - The passage doesn't focus on interaction with *other* groups, but on the effect of discrimination *within* the existing societal context.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, lwati lemntfwana nemibono yebuhlanga kungaba nemtselela kulokulokulandzelako?","The correct answer is **B: Kutiphatsa kwabo (Their self-esteem)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that discrimination (""bantfwana bakhulisa kubandlulula"") *affects how they behave* (""kutsintsa indlela labatiphatsa ngayo"").  The example given demonstrates how being looked down upon due to race leads to lower performance in school, which is a direct result of a negative self-perception.  This directly relates to self-esteem.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **A: Idlandzana lebuhlanga lebakhetsa kutihlanganisa nabo (The racial group they choose to associate with):** The passage doesn't discuss choices of friendship groups.
* **C: Budlelwane babo nalabanye bantfwana (Their relationships with other children):** While discrimination *impacts* relationships, the passage focuses on the internal effect on the child.
* **D: Inchazelo yabo yebuhlanga (Their explanation of race):** The passage doesn't discuss how children *explain* race, only how being discriminated against affects them.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi lokulandzelako lokungeke kuhambisane nekukhuliswa kwemntfwana yemuntfu wesifazane?","The correct answer is **D: Kukhatsateka kwemphakatsi**.

Here's why:

The passage describes children who are deliberately isolated – hidden, abandoned, or raised without human contact (""besiganga"" or outcasts).  This isolation *leads* to difficulties with social interaction and acceptance (""kukhatsateka kwemphakatsi"" - social awkwardness/rejection).  A child properly raised by a mother would *not* typically experience this as a direct result of their upbringing.

Let's look at why the other options are plausible outcomes of *any* child's upbringing, including one with a mother:

*   **A: Kuhlala ngekutimela (Being timid)** - Timidity can be a personality trait developed regardless of upbringing.
*   **B: Emakhono ekucoca lacinile (Refined cleaning skills)** -  These skills are learned, and a mother could certainly teach them.
*   **C: Kutsambekela lokungakatayeleki (Unconventional behavior)** -  While extreme isolation could *cause* this, a child raised normally could also simply be naturally unconventional.



The passage specifically links social difficulties to the *lack* of proper human upbringing. Therefore, it's the one outcome that wouldn’t naturally align with a child raised by a mother."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokuchaza ngalokungiko kutiphatsa kwebantfwana?","The correct answer is **B: Kutiphatsa lokungakafundziseki kungabangela kusweleka kwebudlelwane.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that children labeled ""besiganga"" (outcasts) were often prevented from interacting with others.** This isolation is a direct consequence of being treated differently and leads to a lack of social connection.  The text details how parents *prevented* these children from associating with others.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Liningi lekutiphatsa lokungakafundziseki kubangwa kukhubateka ngekwemtimba:** While physical disability *could* be a reason for abandonment (as the text mentions), it's not the *sole* cause of outcast behavior.  The passage mentions both physical and mental disabilities as reasons for rejection.
* **C: Kutiphatsa lokungakafundziseki kuphela ebantfwaneni labavalelwe batali babo:** The passage describes children hidden *by* parents, but also children abandoned entirely, and those raised by animals. It's not limited to parental concealment.
* **D: Konkhe kutiphatsa lokungakafundziseki kubangelwa kukhubateka lokukhulu kwengcondvo:**  The passage states that both physical and mental disabilities could lead to abandonment, not just severe mental disabilities.

(Farming without the intention of making a business is a type of farming aimed at getting enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kukhicita kudla lokutsengiselwa labanye** (Producing food for sale to others) - This describes commercial farming, *not* subsistence farming.
* **C: Kugcila ekuvuneni lokusetulu ngalokuphambene nemasu latfutfukile** (Focusing on yields that are low in contrast to developed techniques) - While subsistence farming *can* be less efficient, the passage doesn't emphasize low yields as a defining characteristic. It focuses on self-sufficiency.
* **D: Kutfola imbewu endzaweni kuya endzaweni yemlimi** (Getting seeds from place to place of the farmer) -  The passage mentions saving seeds, but it's a *method* used in subsistence farming, not the defining goal of it.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that subsistence farming is often *natural*, using locally preserved seeds and simple methods. It emphasizes it's not about profit, but about providing for the family.  This aligns with a completely natural system, relying on the environment and traditional practices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Isebentisa emasu lahlukile ekukhulisa titjalo** (It uses different methods of growing plants) - While there *are* methods, the passage highlights *simple* methods, not necessarily *different* ones.
* **C: Ivumela balimi kutsi babelane ngetitjalo tabo kuso sonkhe sifundza sabo** (It allows farmers to share their plants throughout their region) -  The passage doesn't mention sharing of crops.
* **D: Isebentiswa balimi kuletinye tive** (It is used by farmers in other times) - The passage mentions it was historically common and *still* exists in many developing areas, implying current use, not just past use.

Here's why:

The passage states that cultural tourism involves visiting a place specifically to learn about its history and culture. Museums are *specifically* places dedicated to preserving and displaying history and culture. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuvakasha kwebhizinisi (Business Tourism):** This involves travel for work-related purposes.
*   **B: Tekuvakasha tekungcebeleka (Recreational Tourism):** While museums can be enjoyable, the primary goal isn't just fun; it's learning. The passage associates recreational tourism with places like beaches and amusement parks.
*   **D: Kuvakasha kwangaphandle (International Tourism):**  This simply refers to travelling to another country, and doesn't define the *type* of tourism. You could go to a museum in your own country.

Here's why:

The passage states that recreational tourism is ""when people go to a place very different from where they live to relax and enjoy themselves.""  This directly points to the primary goal of recreational tourists being to *escape* and *relax* – to take a break from their usual lives.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kugcila emasikweni endzawo** (Immersing themselves in the culture of the place) – This describes *cultural tourism*, not recreational tourism.
*   **C: Kubona timphawu tendzawo letibalulekile** (Seeing important local landmarks) – While tourists *might* do this, it's not the defining goal of recreational tourism.
*   **D: Kuvisisa umlandvo wendzawo** (Understanding the history of the place) – This also describes *cultural tourism*.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tindzaba temphumelelo letinjena tehlisa kwesaba kwenta lushintjo, esikhatsini lesifanako takha tifiso letinhle tekushintja esikhatsi lesitako."" This directly translates to ""Such success stories reduce the fear of change, and at the same time create good desires for changing the future.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kutfola kuvisisa ebantfwini lababe nemtselela welisiko lenhlangano** (Understanding people who had a history with the culture of the organization) - While understanding history is important, the passage specifically links *success stories* to reducing fear.
* **C: Kutfola emandla ekushayela enhlangano** (Finding the power to drive the organization) - The passage doesn't focus on *finding* power, but on the effects of past success.
* **D: Kuvisisa umlandvo wenhlangano** (Understanding the history of the organization) - Understanding history is a broader concept. The passage specifically highlights the impact of *successful* historical examples.

The passage states: ""Njengoba kucondza umlandvo wemuntfu kungasho kutsi sowucondza lisiko lakhe, kodvwa kuyabasita bantfu kubanikete umcondvo wekutsi bawelaphi kulomlandvo walenhlangano.""  This directly translates to ""As understanding a person's history means understanding their culture, it helps people get a sense of where they fit within the history of the organization.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kunciphisa kusaba kushintja** (Reduces fear of change) - While the passage *mentions* reducing fear of change through stories of success, it's a *result* of understanding history, not the primary benefit of understanding a person's history itself.
* **B: Kukhulisa emanani** (Increases values) - The passage doesn't directly link understanding history to increasing values.
* **D: Kwenta kancono kutiphatsa kutemabhizinisi** (Improves dealing with businesses) -  The passage briefly touches on businesses, but the main focus is on understanding the organizational history and one's place within it.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the disconnect between learning and *application*.** It points out how we consume information (through TV, for example) but often can't translate that into real-world changes or action. This means some learning experiences (those that lead to applicable knowledge) are more valuable than others (those that don't).

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Kufundza kufanele kugcile itintfweni lesitsembela kutsi sitawubukana nato** - This isn't the main point of the passage. The passage doesn't suggest focusing on things we already believe.
* **C: Tindlela letitsite tekufundza tincono kunaletinye** - The passage states there's *no single way* to learn, not that some methods are inherently better.
* **D: Kute kuphelela ekufundzeni** - While the passage highlights the limitations of passive learning, it doesn’t state that learning is complete. It suggests learning needs to be *applied* to be fully effective.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that learning is about experience *leading to* knowledge and understanding. It doesn't suggest ranking experiences or prioritizing some over others. It presents learning as a holistic process where everything contributes.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

*   **A: Kunetindlela letiningi tekufundza lwati** - The passage explicitly states ""Ayikho indlela leyodvwa yekufundza"" (There is no single way to learn).
*   **C: Sipiliyoni sekufundza sincike kumfundzi naselwatini loluthulile** - The passage implies this by saying learning requires ""senteko"" (thought/focus) and deriving lessons from experience.
*   **D: Lwati lokungenteka singacali silusebentise kusafanele silufundze** - The example of watching TV shows demonstrates this - we receive information but often don't *apply* it.

Here's why:

The passage describes techniques to lightly wake you up and then *make* you get out of bed, avoiding falling back into deep sleep immediately.  The goal is to reset your sleep cycle.  Reading for a while (an hour and a half is a good duration) can promote relaxation and sleepiness without being overly stimulating, preparing you for a more natural return to sleep.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kusebentisa indlu yekugezela uphindze ubuyele embhedzeni** (Using the bathroom and returning to bed) - While a bathroom trip can be necessary, it doesn't actively address the need to reset your sleep cycle.
* **C: Kuvala i-alarm yakho endzaweni yakho yekulindza ebusuku bese ubuyela emuva kute ulale ngemuva kwemizuzu lengemashumi lamabili** (Turning off your alarm in your sleeping spot and going back to sleep after twenty minutes) - This defeats the purpose! The passage emphasizes *getting out of bed* to avoid immediately falling back into deep sleep.
* **D: Kuvuka unatse emanti lasebhodleleni etulu kwe-nightstand yakho** (Waking up and drinking water from a bottle above your nightstand) -  This is mentioned in the passage as a tactic to *cause* you to wake up (dehydration), not a tactic to *recover* from a mid-sleep interruption and improve sleep quality.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes sleep inertia:** It explains being woken up *during* a sleep cycle and the grogginess/difficulty functioning that follows. The methods suggested (alarm across the room, slight dehydration) are all about *mitigating* the effects of sleep inertia, not intentionally trying to re-establish a full sleep within two hours.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kungasuselwa esigcini se-bio (It is based on a biological clock):** The passage *uses* biorhythms to explain *why* sleep inertia happens, but it's not the core definition of the phenomenon itself.
* **B: Umgomo wekutsi ungativusi ngalokugcwele (The goal is not to fully wake you up):** This describes the *strategy* used with the alarm clock, but isn’t the definition of sleep inertia. Sleep inertia is what *happens* when you *are* woken up (even if it's gently).
* **C: Inchubo yenteka phakatsi nesikhatsi sakho sekulala lesivamile (A disruption that occurs during your normal sleep time):** While sleep inertia *happens* during sleep, this is a general statement about sleep disruption and doesn't define the specific feeling of grogginess and impaired performance.

"Njengoba bucopho butama kuphupha ngalokungiko kaningi, yini leyandzako?","The correct answer is **A: Linani letifundza te-REM** (The number of REM cycles).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the feeling of being interrupted is linked to ""Ngema-REM lambalwa ngebusuku lobubodvwa"" (the few REM cycles during the night). It explains that frequent attempts to recall dreams during the night contribute to the sensation of being frequently interrupted, mirroring the feeling of being woken up after short intervals while watching TV. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Emazinga emandla** (Energy levels) - The passage doesn’t discuss energy levels.
* **C: Budze besimo sekutakula** (The severity of the condition) - While the passage discusses a feeling that *could* be unsettling, it doesn't focus on the severity of a condition.
* **D: Sikhatsi phakatsi kwesifundza se-REM** (Time between REM cycles) -  The passage emphasizes the *number* of REM cycles, not necessarily the time *between* them.



"
Ngumuphi kulemiphumela lemibili lelandzelako lengahle ibe nako kuphupha lokucacile emtimbeni?,"The correct answer is **A: Budze besikhatsi lobunciphile phakatsi kwetifundza te-REM**.

Here's why:

The passage states that lucid dreams are linked to ""lomphumela walamaphupho lamahle lachubekisa lobudze besikhatsi emkhatsini wemave eREM"" - the continuation of good dreams for a short time within REM cycles.  This means *shorter* time between REM phases could contribute to lucid dreaming because the dream state is more readily re-entered.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kuncishiswe ema-REM ngebusuku ngabunye** - The passage describes REM as *important* to lucid dreaming, not reduced.
* **C: Kuncika ekuphupheni lokucacile** - This is circular reasoning – it states the effect depends on the thing itself.
* **D: Ema-REM akhuphuliwe ngebusuku ngabunye** -  The passage doesn't suggest an *increase* in REM, but a continuation *within* the REM cycle.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, emacembu latayelekile kanye nemacembu labonakalako afana njani?","The correct answer is **A: Womabili emacembu kulindzeleke kutsi ente ezingeni lelifanako.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Emacembu ekubonana abanjwa ngendlela lesezingeni lelisetulu lelifanako nelemacembu lavamile...""  This directly translates to ""Teams that meet are held in a similar high-level way as normal teams...""  Meaning both types of teams are expected to perform at the same standard.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage highlights a *difference* in standards, not a similarity.
* **C:** Only the visible team reports to the informal team - not both.
* **D:** The passage mentions the visible team having different meeting schedules, implying *different* times, not the same.



"
"Ngalokusekelwe endzimeni, ngusiphi sitatimende lesiphatselene nemacembu laphatsekako kanye nangekweliciniso lokungasilo liciniso?","The correct answer is **B: Emacembu labonakalako avame kusebenta njenge ndzawo yekuchumana kwemacembu latayelekile.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Emalunga elicembu labonakalako imvamisa asebenta njengendlela yekuchumana yalelicembu lelingokocobo lanyalo.""  This translates to ""Members of the formal group often serve as a communication channel for the informal group.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Emacembu latayelekile atayele kubanjelwa ezingeni lelisetulu** - The passage says formal and informal groups exist *at the same level* (""lifanako""), not that formal groups are always held at a higher level.
*   **C: Emacembu lavamile anekutimela lokuncane kunemacembu labonakalako** - The passage doesn't compare the commitment levels directly, but implies informal groups *can* be more committed due to their specific interactions.
*   **D: Tikhatsi letishintjako tingazuza emacembu labonakalako** - While the passage mentions different meetings for different groups, it doesn't say these benefit the formal group. It implies they are a *cause* of the informal group’s existence.

Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungasiyo intfo yemicabango yalokucuketfwe lagcile kuko?,"The correct answer is **B: Kutsi imvelo yemutfu itintsintsa njani tento tabo** (How a person's nature influences their choices).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on *acquired* motivations,** meaning motivations people develop through life experiences and needs. It talks about why people choose or complain about things, and how beliefs shape these choices based on underlying needs and desires.
* **Option B delves into *innate* nature.**  While a person's inherent personality does play a role in choices, the passage specifically centers on motivations that *arise* as people grow and face different circumstances, not on pre-existing personality traits.

Let's look at why the other options *are* related to the passage:

* **A: Tifiso letisha letenteka uma sewukhulile (New desires that emerge as you get older):** This aligns directly with the passage's idea that needs and desires change throughout life.
* **C: Tidzingo tangekhatsi (Intrinsic needs):**  The passage explicitly mentions intrinsic needs and desires as the basis for motivations.
* **D: Kuvisisa kutsandvwa bantfu (Understanding the need for affection):** This relates to the idea of underlying needs influencing behavior – a need for belonging and love would be a motivating factor.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungasiyo intfo yemtsetfo wesitsatfu?,"The correct answer is **D: Kucalisa li-order ngaphakatsi kwesitfombe (It introduces order within the composition).**

Here's why:

The passage describes the leading line as *simple*, *creating variation*, and *ending in a focal point*.  It's about *guiding the eye*. 

Let's look at why the other options *are* characteristics of a leading line:

* **A: Kudala sisekelo lapho sihloko singabekwa khona (It creates a foundation where the subject can be placed):** Leading lines often guide the eye *towards* the subject.
* **B: Kudala imphilo nemandla phakatsi kwesitfombe (It creates life and energy within the composition):**  Directing the eye adds visual interest and energy.
* **C: Kugcina sitfombe sisendzaweni letsite nalesebentako (It keeps the composition neat and functional):** Leading lines help organize the visual elements.

Introducing *order* isn't necessarily the *primary* function of a leading line.  It's more about guiding the view, not simply imposing order. The passage focuses on the *dynamic* aspect of a leading line (variation, focal point) rather than its organizational role.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungachazi ifomethi yesitfombe lesingu-35mm?,"The correct answer is **C: Ine-aspect ratio lehlukile kunemafomethi lamaningi latayelekile**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The 35mm format has an aspect ratio of 3:2 and *many* common formats (like APS) *match or closely approximate* this ratio.  Therefore, a format that *doesn't* have a similar aspect ratio would not be describing the 35mm format.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Isakhicitwa:** The passage describes the 35mm format very specifically (size, dimensions, aspect ratio).
* **B: Yemukelwa yifomethi yemakhamera edijithali:** The passage explicitly states that the 35mm format has been adapted for use in modern digital cameras.
* **D: Ifomethi levame kakhulu emhlabeni:** The passage states it *was* the most popular format, implying it's still important and known.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, njengoba bakhiciti banyuse lizinga lekukhicitwa kwemalensi, athuthukiswe njani emalensi e-zoom?","The correct answer is **A: Anelijubane lelisetulu lemalensi** (Higher focal complexity of lenses).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lokukabi ngetibuko tekubukela dvute kutsi le-focal complexity nelinani letintfo letidzengekako kutfola budze bema-focal kukhulu kunaletinye tibuko letivamile.""  This translates to: ""The advantage of zoom lenses is that their focal complexity and the number of elements required to achieve a large focal length are greater than other normal lenses.""

The passage then connects this increased complexity to *higher quality images* (""emalensi e-zoom akhicite titfombe letisezingeni lelisetulu"").  Therefore, the development of zoom lenses is characterized by a higher focal complexity leading to improved image quality.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kulula kuwasebentisa etimeni tekukhanya lokuphansi** (Easy to use in low light) - The passage actually states zoom lenses are *more difficult* to use in low light due to their slower speed.
*   **C: Ikhuwalithi yesithombe sawo ifana nemalensi lanebudze lobugcilile** (Their image quality is the same as fixed focal length lenses) - The passage says they produce *higher quality* images.
*   **D: Anebumatima lobuncane bekugcila kunemalensi laphambili** (Has a smaller weight compared to previous lenses) - The passage does not mention weight.



"
"Ngalokusekelwe elwatini lolusendzimeni, kunini lapho I-zoom lensi ingahle ikhetse khona kune-prime lens?","The correct answer is **A: uma imbobo lesetulu ibalulekile** (if a large aperture is important).

Here's why:

The text states that zoom lenses generally have *slower* apertures (smaller maximum aperture, higher f-number) compared to prime lenses.  A slower aperture means less light enters the lens. However, the text also highlights that focal complexity allows zoom lenses to achieve higher image quality. This implies a trade-off: you gain image quality but potentially sacrifice a large aperture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Uma ufuna sici selensi lesincane** (If you want a small lens feature) - The text doesn't mention size as a benefit of zoom lenses. In fact, complex lenses are often larger.
*   **C: uma ungafuni kusebentisa kukhanya endzaweni lemnyama** (If you don't want to use light in a dark place) - The text says zoom lenses are *harder* to use in low light *because* of their smaller apertures.
*   **D: Uma ubuka bumatima lobukhulu lobugcilile** (If you are looking at the complexity of detail) - The text does mention higher image quality, but this is a result of the focal complexity, not a reason to specifically *choose* a zoom lens.

Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungeke kutsatfwe njenge nchazelo lekungiyo ye-Mysticism?,"The correct answer is **D: Kugcizelelwakwekufuna lokuhlangenwe nako lokucondzile esicini semuntfu kucatsaniswa noma ngutiphi letinye tinhlobo tenkholelo yenkholo nekukhulekela.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that mysticism *distinguishes itself* from other religions and worship by its emphasis on the **individual's direct experience**. Option D suggests mysticism prioritizes individual experience *over* all other forms of belief and worship, which isn't quite accurate.  Mysticism isn't necessarily *against* other beliefs, but it places a unique emphasis on personal spiritual connection.

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with the passage:

*   **A: Kukhona kugcizelela ekubukaneni netimo letinekuthula naletijabulisako tekucaphela** - The passage mentions peace, contentment, and even ecstatic bliss as outcomes of mystical experience.
*   **B: Balandzeli be-mysticism bafuna kucaphela liciniso lelingekwemoya** - The passage defines mysticism as seeking to unite with spiritual truths, God, or the divine.
*   **C: Balandzeli bemfihlakalo bangahle batsatse imikhuba letawusita ekukhuliseni kucondza kwabo ngeliciniso lelisetulu** - The passage states followers strive to live in ways or practice habits that align with those truths.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungasiyo ingcikitsi ye-Mysticism?","The correct answer is **B: Kulandzelela kucondza ngekusebentisa lokwebiwe, sipiliyoni semphakatsi.**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that mysticism is about a *personal, direct experience* of the divine or spiritual truth. It highlights individual feelings like peace, joy, or even intense suffering as pathways to understanding. Relying on established doctrines (""lokwebiwe"" - that which is written/taught) and communal experiences (""sipiliyoni semphakatsi"" - community experience) is more characteristic of organized religion, not the individualistic core of mysticism described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with the passage:

*   **A: Kufuna imiva ibe ngekweliciniso** (Seeking to align with truth) - This aligns with the passage's mention of seeking ""liciniso lakamoya"" (spiritual truth).
*   **C: Kugcizelela esimeni lesijabulisakos ekucaphela** (Emphasizing states of joy in contemplation) - The passage directly mentions joy as a possible outcome of mystical experience.
*   **D: Kulandzelela kwati ngaNkulunkulu** (Pursuing knowledge of God) -  This relates to the passage’s reference to seeking “Nkulunkulu” (God).



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubani lokungenteka kutsi wacala umphakatsi wetekulima?","The correct answer is **B: Moriori wase-Chatham Islands**.

Here's why:

The passage states that new evidence suggests the Moriori *were* a distinct branch of Māori who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, developing their own unique and peaceful culture. It's this group of Moriori who established a farming society on the Chatham Islands.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Moriori wase-New Zealand:** While the Moriori *originated* from New Zealand, the passage specifies they developed the farming society *after* migrating to the Chatham Islands.
* **C: Bantfu base Maori lababuya ePolynesia:** The passage states the initial belief was that Māori came *from* Polynesia, but the new evidence shifts the focus to the Moriori’s development *within* New Zealand and then the Chatham Islands.
* **D: Maori yasevenikati:** The passage does not mention ""Maori yasevenikati"" (interior Māori). It focuses on the split between Māori remaining in New Zealand and those who became Moriori.



"
"Ngakusho kwendzima, licembu lebelitingela ema-moas belibantfu bekucala labahlala kuyiphi indzawo?","The correct answer is **B: E-New Zealand**.

Here's why:

The passage states the initial belief was that the first inhabitants of New Zealand (who hunted moas) were Māori who came from Polynesia. While later evidence suggests a more complex story, the question asks about the *initial* belief regarding the hunters of moas.  The text specifically links those hunters to the early Māori in New Zealand.



"
Kusiphi simo lapho kusebentisa indlela ye-Pureland ye-origami kungazuzisa ifolda?,"The correct answer is **A: Umgoci ukhetsa kwenta kugoca ngalokuphindza phindziwe ngesikhatsi sinye** (The folder chooses to make repeated folds at once).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the Pureland method was designed for ""inexperienced or those with limited dexterity."" It allows for folding multiple layers simultaneously, simplifying the process.  Option A directly relates to this - repeatedly folding at once is a core benefit for someone with less skill.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Umgoci unemakhono latfutfukile ekusebentisa imisipha.** (The folder has advanced skills in using muscles.) - The method is *for* those *without* advanced skills.
*   **C: Umgoci wakha i-origami ledzinga kugocwa ibuyele emuva** (The folder creates origami that requires reverse folding) - The passage specifically states reverse folds are *not* allowed with this method.
*   **D: Umgcoci ukutame kanye noma kabili ngaphambilini** (The folder has practiced once or twice before) - The method is useful even for those with *no* prior experience.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungachazi ngalokungiko i-origami yase-Pureland?,"The correct answer is **B: Indlela iyifaki kugcogca lokubuyela emuva**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""tindlela letiyinkimbinkimbi tekugoca njengekugoca uyise emuva atikavumeleki"" which translates to ""complex folding methods like folding backwards are not allowed.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ihloselwe emafolida lanelwati** - The passage says it was designed for beginners or those with limited skills.
*   **C: Kugcogca kufanele kuba nendzawo lecondze phambili** - The passage says ""tonkhe tintfo letigocwako tigocwa tiyiswe phambili"" - everything is folded forward.
*   **D: Kuyindlela lenhle yekugcogca lenemakhono lalinganiselwe emoto** - The passage states this is a purpose of the method (for those with limited skills).



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, nguyiphi indzawo lengakahlangani ne-Indus Valley Civilization?","The correct answer is **C: Tonkhe tifundza enyakatho-mpumalanga Afghanistan**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Indus Valley Civilization included ""cishe yonkhe iPakistan yesimanje naletinye tigodzi letisenyakatfo nemphumalanga nenyakatfo yenshonalanga ne-Afghanistan."" This means it *did* include parts of Afghanistan. Therefore, it’s not an area that was *not* part of the civilization.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I-Harappa:** The passage mentions Harappa as the location of its first discovery, meaning it *was* part of the civilization.
*   **B: Umfula i-Sarasvati:** The passage acknowledges some believe it should be called the Indus-Sarasvati Civilization, meaning it's connected to it.
*   **D: Liningi lePakistan yanamuhla:** The passage explicitly states it includes ""cishe yonkhe iPakistan yesimanje.""



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakabalwa njengeligama lekungaba ngilo libe le-Bronze Civilization lecocwe kulendzima?,"The correct answer is **C: yi-Indus River Civilization**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states the civilization is called the **Indus Valley Civilization**, the **Indus-Sarasvati Civilization**, and the **Harappan Civilization**.
*   While the civilization *originated* near the Indus River, the text doesn't refer to it as the ""Indus River Civilization"" as an official name. It's a description of *where* it began, not *what* it's called.

Therefore, ""Indus River Civilization"" is the only option that isn't presented as a possible name for the Bronze Age civilization in the text.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokuletsa inzuzo yesikhatsi eceleni?","The correct answer is **A: Kuhambisana nalabanye** (Working together with others).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""bantfu labaningi batobona kutsi lokuncono kakhulu esikhatsini lesidze kusebenta kanyekanye nalabanye."" (many people see that the best thing in recent times is to work together with others).  This directly supports the idea that collaboration leads to positive outcomes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kubeka titsakaselo temuntfu phambili** (Putting individual interests first) - The passage implies the opposite – that focusing solely on individual gain can lead to exploitation (""labatawenta bugovu batfole inzuzo lenkhulu"" - those who exploit others profit greatly).
* **C: Gcizelela loko lokungazuzisa lidlandzana ngetulu kwalabaningi** (Emphasizing what benefits a few over many) - This is also linked to the negative example of exploitation.
* **D: Kucaphela kutsi kuhala kungaba yinzuzo** (Concluding that hardship can be a benefit) - The passage doesn’t suggest hardship is beneficial; it highlights the issue of people taking advantage of difficult situations.

"Ngekusho kwalendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako umuntfu langahle akubeke phambili uma kugcila kwakhe kusetinzunzweni tanyalo.","The correct answer is **B: Kusebentisana (Collaboration)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Asetsembe kutsi, bantfu labaningi batobona kutsi lokuncono kakhulu esikhatsini lesidze kusebenta kanyekanye nalabanye.""  This translates to ""It is believed that many people see that the best thing in recent times is to work together with others.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kutidzela (Self-reliance):** The passage *contrasts* this with the positive outcome of working with others.
*   **C: Kubambisana (Unity):** While related to collaboration, it's not the direct focus of the passage's main point about achieving better results.
*   **D: Bugovu (Cheating/Fraud):** The passage actually *criticizes* this, stating that some profit greatly from others' misfortunes.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubani lohlanganise incenye lenkhulu yetindleko tempi?","The correct answer is **B: Emabhange e-Wall Street**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Filipinos were forced to pay off a portion of the debt obligations *on behalf of the Philippine government* through Wall Street. This implies that Wall Street institutions were heavily involved in financing and profiting from this debt.  The text explicitly links the profit made from this situation to American imperialism, suggesting Wall Street played a key role in that process.



"
Ngusiphi sikhatsi lesafika ngaphambi kweminyaka yema-Templars?,"The correct answer is **C: Kminyaka lesekucaleni nemkhatsi** (Early Middle Ages).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""EmaHigh Middle Ages andvulela emaEarly Middle Ages..."" which translates to ""The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages..."".  Therefore, the period *before* the Templars (who existed during the High Middle Ages) was the Early Middle Ages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: i-Late Middle Ages:** This came *after* the High Middle Ages.
*   **B: i-12th century:** The 12th century is *within* the High Middle Ages.
*   **D: Likhulu leminyaka 13:** The 13th century is also *within* the High Middle Ages.



"
Ngusiphi sikhatsi lesafika ngemuva kweminyaka yema-Templars?,"The correct answer is **A: i-Late Middle Ages**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""EmaHigh Middle Ages andvulela emaEarly Middle Ages alandzelwa ngemaLate Middle Ages..."" which translates to ""The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages...""

Therefore, the period that came *after* the High Middle Ages (the time of the Templars) is the Late Middle Ages.

Nguyiphi indlela yekulapha noma inchubo lekungakhulunywa ngekutsi beyisetjentiswa bodokotela nabodokotela lahlindzako ngesikhatsi sembuso waseRoma?,"The correct answer is **B: Kusebentisa tincaphuno tembewu ye-herbane ye-scoplamine**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...ne-scopolamine lephuma embewini yesitjalo se-herbane."" This directly indicates that scopolamine, derived from the henbane plant, was used by Roman doctors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While Romans dealt with trauma, the passage doesn't mention PTSD or specific treatments for it.
*   **C:** The passage mentions preventing bleeding using ""tintfo letitsite"" (small things) but doesn't specify arterial clamps.
*   **D:** The passage doesn't mention bloodletting or any practices of draining fluids from patients.

"Ngekusho kwalendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakadzalulwa intfutfuko leyentiwe emkhakheni wetekulapha ngesikhatsi sembuso waseRoma?","The correct answer is **A: Kwakhiwa kweNhlangano yeTekulapha (The establishment of a Medical Corps)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""yaphindze yakha iRoman Medical Corps yekucala yekusentjentiswa ngemuva kwetimphi"" (and then built the first Roman Medical Corps for use after the wars). This directly refers to the creation of a formal medical organization, which is what option A describes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Inchubomgomo yetetimpi yembuso lenelulaka (A policy of state temples):** The passage doesn't mention anything about policies regarding temples.
*   **C: Kwakhiwa kwetibhedlela tekufundza (The construction of teaching hospitals):** While the Romans made advancements in medicine, the passage doesn't say they built hospitals specifically for teaching.
*   **D: Kucashwa kwabodokotela yiNkhosi (Doctors being honored by the King):** While doctors were recognized (Augustus ""kucashwa"" them), the *establishment of the Medical Corps* is a more significant advancement in the field of medicine than simply honoring doctors.



"
Lincike tukwani likhono lekubona?,"The correct answer is **A: Titfo tesimiso yemiva yekubona** (The principles of visual systems).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kubona, noma likhono lekubona kushiyana etintfweni letisebentisa imiva yekubona noma emehlo."" (Vision, or the ability to see, differs in organisms that use visual systems or eyes). This directly links the *ability* to see to the underlying **visual systems** themselves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tidzingo tentfo lephilako** (Needs of the living thing) - While the passage mentions organisms needing different vision for survival, it doesn't say that *defines* the ability to see. The needs *influence* what kind of vision develops, not the ability itself.
*   **C: Kuvakala kwebudze lobutsite beligagasi** (Perception of the brightness of light) - Brightness is *part* of vision, but it doesn't encompass the entire ability to see.
*   **D: Emazinga e-acuity lahlukahlukene** (Different levels of acuity) - Acuity (sharpness of vision) is a *characteristic* of vision, not what makes the ability to see possible in the first place.



"
Kuhluka kwesakhiwo semehlo phakatsi kwetintfo letiphilako kuncike kuphi?,"The correct answer is **B: Tidzingo temtimba (Needs of the organism)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that eye structures vary ""depending on the needs of the living organism.""  It goes on to explain how different structures are suited to different wavelengths, sensitivities, and functions. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuvela budze beligagasi (Appearance of the glass)** - This is irrelevant to the passage's discussion of eye *structure* and function.
* **C: Lizinga le-acuity (Level of acuity)** - Acuity is a *result* of eye structure, not a cause of it.
* **D: Bumatima bemtimba (Strength of the body)** - Body strength is unrelated to the specific requirements that shape eye structure.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Yachubeka ikhona iminyaka leyimfica."" which translates to ""It continued to exist for many years afterwards."" This directly indicates the faith persisted and developed beyond Guru Nanak's initial founding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I-Sikhism beyimphumela wekuhlukana kwemahlalo phakatsi kwelisiko lema-Hindu** - While the passage states Sikhism arose *within* a Hindu cultural context and distinguishes itself *from* Hinduism, it doesn't explicitly frame it solely as a result of social separation. It speaks of it developing a *different* belief system.
* **B: I-guru isici lesibalulekile lesingakavami ku-Sikhism** - The text emphasizes the *centrality* of Gurus (teachers) to Sikhism, stating they are ""essential and respected in all Indian religions but are most important in Sikhism"". It's not something uncommon.
* **D: Emasiko latsite eSikhism asekelwe ku-Hinduism** - The passage states Sikhism acknowledges roots in Hindu traditions, but emphasizes its distinct identity (""different from Hinduism"").  It doesn't say all its practices are *based* on Hinduism.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sikhism ngiyo lebalulekile leyakha umgogodla wetikholelo teSikh."" (Sikhism itself is important in building the foundation of Sikh beliefs). This directly links the core of the Sikh faith to the teachings and guidance of the Gurus.  It also mentions Guru Nanak as the founder and the faith continuing through subsequent Gurus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Emasiko ema-Hindu:** While the passage acknowledges Sikhism originates *within* a Hindu cultural context, it explicitly states Sikhs consider their belief system *distinct* from Hinduism.
* **C: Kwala kuvuma letinye tinkholo temandiya:** The passage doesn't state Sikhism is defined by accepting other Indian religions. It highlights its uniqueness.
* **D: Kukhuluma si-Punjabi:** While Punjabi is the language of the term ""Gurmat"", the passage doesn't indicate language is a core tenet of the faith itself.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, kungani bantfwana labanenkinga yekuswela Kunakwa Lokungentek Kube Matima Kugcila kuyo?","The correct answer is **D: Tintfo labajabulela kutenta** (Things they enjoy doing).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Labantfwana bane-ADD bakutfola kumantima kugcila etintfweni letifana nemsebenti wesikolwa, kepha bayakhona kugcila etintfweni labatsandzako kutenta njengekudlala imidlalo nobe kubukela bopopayi lababatsandzako nobe kubhala imisho lengenatimphawu tekukhuluma.""

This translates to: ""Children with ADD find it difficult to focus on things like schoolwork, but they *can* focus on things they enjoy doing, such as playing games or watching their favorite shows...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umsebenti wesikolo (Schoolwork):** The passage specifically says they have *difficulty* focusing on schoolwork.
*   **B: Kudlala imidlalo (Playing games):** While they *can* focus on games, the answer needs to be more general - it's about things they enjoy.
*   **C: Kubukela bopopayi (Watching TV):** Same as above - it's an example, not the core reason.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, kungani bantfwana labanenkinga Yekunaka bavame kutibandzakanya ekutiphatseni lokuyingoti?","The correct answer is **A: Kwehlisa kusebenta kakhulu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Labantfwana bavamisa kungena etinkingeni letinkhulu, ngoba """"benta tintfo letiyingoti, bayalwa, futsi baphikisane neligunya"""" kuze basitwe endleleni labacabanga ngayo, njengoba tingcodvo tabo tingeke tisitwe tindlela letivamile nje.""  This directly translates to: ""These children often get into big trouble because ""they do naughty things, fight, and argue with authority"" in order to be understood in the way they think, as their brains cannot be controlled in normal ways.""

This means the ""naughty"" or problematic behavior is a way for them to cope with or express their different way of thinking and their inability to function in typical ways. It's a way to *reduce frustration*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kubasita bahlangane nabontsanga:** The passage mentions ADD relating to social difficulties, but doesn't say problematic behavior helps them connect with peers.
*   **C: Kute batfole kunakwa batali babo:** While attention-seeking behavior *can* be a factor in some cases, the passage specifically links the behavior to their cognitive differences.
*   **D: Kuvuselela bucopho:** The passage does not mention anything about stimulating curiosity.

"Ngekusekela elwatini lelisendzimeni, ngukuphi kuloku lokungasiso sibonelo sekwenta sikafu?","The correct answer is **A: Sifundvo ekucaleni kwemdlalo wangcondvo mshini (A tutorial at the beginning of a machine learning game)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes learning by *doing* and receiving support while tackling new tasks.** It specifically mentions examples like learning new software (like Microsoft Office) or starting a new job.
* **A machine learning game tutorial directly embodies this.** It introduces a new skill (machine learning) and provides scaffolding – prompts to do things, explanations of what was done – as the user learns. This aligns with the ""Virtual Scaffold"" concept described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Umfundzisi we-SAT (SAT tutor):** While helpful, SAT tutoring focuses on *preparation* for a specific test, not necessarily learning a fundamentally new skill with ongoing support.
* **C: Luhlelo lekufundza lelitimele (A self-paced learning program):**  Self-paced learning can be good, but the passage specifically highlights the *teacher's* role in providing support and scaffolding.
* **D: Umceceshi weligi lencane (Little League coach):** While a coach offers guidance, the passage's context is more about acquiring *knowledge and skills* in a formal learning environment, not athletic training.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungawuchazi kahle umcondvo wekwenta sikafu?,"The correct answer is **D: Tikafu tisebentiselwa kuniketa kwesekwa ekucaleni kwesipiliyoni sekufundza.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Virtual Scaffolds afakwa ngekhatsi kwale-software futsi entelwe kubuta, kucela kutsi wente, nekuchaza loko umfundzi labekakutfola kumetima kukwenta ayedvwana."" This directly describes scaffolds *supporting* a learner as they begin to experience and understand something new.  They provide assistance (""asks, requests, and explains"") at the starting point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tikafu tingabakhona cishe:** The passage doesn’t discuss the potential existence of scaffolds, only what they *do*.
* **B: Kulusito kakhulu kunendlela yekufundza:**  The passage presents scaffolds as *part of* a learning approach (project-based learning), not as superior to learning itself. They *support* the learning process.
* **C: Kwatiwa nangekutsi kufundza lokusekelwe kumaphrojekthi:**  While scaffolds are used *with* project-based learning, the passage is specifically defining what scaffolds *are*, not describing project-based learning in general.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngusiphi sici seMySpace lesingazuzisa bafundzi labanenkinga yekufundza?","The correct answer is **C: Likheli lewebhu lelilodvwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lelikhasi ungangena kalula kulo ngekufaka likheli lewebhusayithi nje yinye, lokwenta kube lula kulikhumbula futsi kube lula kubhala kubafundzi labangaba nebumatima kusebentisa i-keyboard noma kubhala emagama."" (This page can be easily accessed by entering just one website address, making it easy to remember and easy to type for students who have difficulty using the keyboard or spelling words.)

This directly relates to helping students with reading difficulties because a single, easy-to-remember address simplifies access.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kwenta ngekufisa (Customization):** While useful, it doesn't directly address reading/typing difficulties.
*   **B: Emabhulogi (Blogs):** Blogs are a feature, but don't specifically help with reading/typing challenges.
*   **D: Emaphrofayili latingidzi letingu-54 (54 million profiles):** The number of profiles is irrelevant to reading difficulties.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lobekungasiyo incenye yemphendvulo ya-Krushchev esibhebheni sesisebenti?","The correct answer is **B: Sebentisa emathangi kubuyisela ema-oda**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Khrushchev *sent troops to restore order*, but it doesn't say they used tanks. In fact, it highlights that he ultimately *agreed to demands* and *allowed Gomulka to become the new leader*.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Khetsa indvunankhulu lesha (Choose a new leader):** The passage explicitly states Krushchev allowed Wladyslaw Gomulka to become the new leader.
*   **C: Kwandzisa kunciphiswa kwemholo (Increase wage cuts):** The passage indicates the protests were *against* wage cuts, and Krushchev responded by giving in to demands, so he wouldn't have increased them.
*   **D: Mukela letinye tidzingo temnotfo (Accept some demands):** The passage states Krushchev ""yielded to some demands relating to welfare"" and ""agreed that Gomulka should be the new prime minister"", confirming he accepted demands.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungasiyo imbangela yeluthuli ePoland?,"The correct answer is **D: Kukhetfwa kwa-Wladyslaw Gomulka**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the protests *led to* Wladyslaw Gomulka being appointed as the new prime minister. He wasn't a *cause* of the protests; he was a *result* of them. 

The other options are all mentioned as causes of the protests:

*   **Bukhomanisi (Communism):** The protests were ""against communism.""
*   **Kuswelakala Kwekudla (Food shortages):** Workers protested over ""the scarcity of food.""
*   **Kunciphiswa kwemholo (Wage reductions):** Workers protested over ""reduced wages.""



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakatsintsi budlelwane phakatsi kwe-USSR kanye ne-USA?","The correct answer is **C: Tinchubo letiphikisanako** (Conflicting interests).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""inchubo nemasiko kwenta kutsi lamave acabane"" (interests and ideologies caused these countries to disagree). This directly points to conflicting interests as the source of the breakdown in the USSR-USA relationship after WWII.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Umehluko wemasiko** (Cultural differences) - While cultural differences *contributed* to the overall tension, the passage highlights ""interests"" as the primary driver of disagreement.
*   **B: Imibono mayelana ne-Germany** (Views on Germany) - The passage doesn’t mention Germany specifically as a point of contention.
*   **D: Tingcabano mayelana netinhlelo** (Disagreements about plans) - This is too vague. ""Interests"" encompass a wider range of disagreements, including strategic plans.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungachazi ngalokungiko inhloso yekutfumela imiva emtimbeni wonkhe?,"The correct answer is **C: Kugcina i-homeostasis**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lemifutfo yemiva ingatfumeleka ngekushesha kuwo wonkhe umtimba lokusita umtimba uhlale uphephile kunoma yini lewuhlaselako."" (These blood vessels can quickly spread throughout the body to help the body stay safe from anything that attacks it.)  This describes the body maintaining a stable internal environment - which is the definition of **homeostasis**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kunciphisa kugeleta kwengati (Reducing inflammation):** While improved circulation *can* help with inflammation, the passage doesn't state that reducing inflammation is the *purpose* of the blood vessels spreading.
* **B: Kulawula kugeleta kwengati (Controlling inflammation):**  Similar to A, control isn't the main purpose described.
* **D: Gwema tinsongo temtimba letingaba khona (Avoiding potential bodily pains):**  While a healthy circulatory system can *contribute* to avoiding pain, the passage focuses on overall protection and stability, not just pain avoidance.



**In summary:** The passage emphasizes the blood vessels' role in quickly responding to threats and maintaining the body's overall safety and stability, which is fundamentally about maintaining **homeostasis**."
Yini lengatfilakala e-The Giza Plateau?,"The correct answer is **B: Emathempheli**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I-Giza Plateau... inema-pyramid lamanyentana, emathuna lamancane lamanyentana, **emathempeli lamanyentana**, neSphinz lenkhulu."" (Giza Plateau... has several pyramids, several small tombs, **several temples**, and the Great Sphinx).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lithuna** - The passage mentions tombs (""emathuna lamancane""), but doesn't state that *only* tombs are found there.
*   **C: Tonkhe timangaliso letidikhombisa** - The passage specifically says the Great Pyramid is the *only* one of the Seven Wonders still standing.
*   **D: Iphiramidi lenkhulu** - While the Great Pyramid *is* at Giza, the passage lists other structures besides just the pyramid.



"
Bekuyini inhloso ye-Phiramidi Lekhulu?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuhlonipha Pharaor**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""I-pyramid lenkhulu yakhiwelwa kuhlonipha Faro Khufu, futsi lamanyenti alama-pyramid, emathuna, nemathempeli akhiwelwa kuhlonipha bafati baKhufu nemalungu emndeni."" (The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and the other pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kute ube ngulomunye wetinhlangano letisikhombisa temhlaba** - While it *is* one of the Seven Wonders, that wasn't the *purpose* of building it.
*   **C: Kusebenta njengendzawo leyacupha umlandvo** - While it *does* serve that purpose now, it wasn't the original intention.
*   **D: Kugcina ematje emathuna ebantfu labangasekho** - While tombs are present at Giza, the pyramids themselves were built as monuments to the pharaohs, not simply as storage for remains.



"
Ngubani lonesibopho ngelwati letfu lemshiseli lowacekela phasi lithempeli?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngu-Strabo**.

Here's why:

* The text states that the Greek historian Strabo **wrote down** Herostratus’s name, which is how we know about the arsonist today. While Herostratus *committed* the act, Strabo is the one responsible for preserving the information for us.
* **A: Be-Ephesia** wanted the arsonist's name erased, not preserved.
* **B: Alexander lomkhulu** offered to rebuild the temple, but wasn’t involved in recording the arson.
* **D: Ngu-Artemis** is a goddess, not a historical figure who would record events.



"
Ngukuphi lokunenkhulumo lekungiyo ngalokuphatselane nekwakhiwa kabusha kwelithempeli la-Artemis?,"The correct answer is **B: Yakhiwe kabusha ngemuva kwekuphatsa kwa-Alexander Lomkhulu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ngekuhamba kwesikhatsi, ngemuva kwekufa kwa-Alekzanda, lithempeli lakhiwa kabusha nga-323 BCE."" This directly translates to ""Over time, after the death of Alexander, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BCE.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kwakhiwa kabusha kwabhadalwa ngu-Alexander Lomkhulu** - While Alexander *offered* to rebuild, the offer was *rejected*.
*   **C: I-Herostatus yayalelwa kutsi ibukane netindleko tekwakha kabusha** - Herostratus was punished for destroying the temple, not for paying to rebuild it.
*   **D: Yakhiwe kabusha ngo-320 BCE** - The text specifies 323 BCE.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, kwacala nini kutsi luhlobo lolutsite lahamba ngemilente lemibili?","The correct answer is **A: Iminyaka leyitigidzi letisikhombisa leyandlula**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""nanobe iSahelanthropus kungenteka kutsi yayihamba ngetinyawo letimbili ekucaleni kweminyakeni letigidzi letisikhombisa letindlulile.""  This directly translates to ""although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs at the beginning of over seven million years ago.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Iminyaka leyitigidzi letibile leyandlula:** The passage mentions 4.2-3.9 million years ago, not eight million.
* **C: Iminyaka letigidzi 3.9 leyandlula:** While evidence of bipedalism *exists* from around 3.9 million years ago, the passage suggests it *potentially* started earlier.
* **D: Iminyaka leyitigidzi letine 4.2 leyandlula:** Similar to C, this is evidence *of* bipedalism, not necessarily when it *began*.



"
Ngutiphi kuletilwane letivame kuhamba ngetinyawo letimbili?,"The correct answer is **B: I-Homo Erectus**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""bantfu bacala kuhamba ngalokucondzile etigidzini letimbili teminyaka letendlulile ngekuvela kwa**Homo Erectus** (lokusho kutsi indvodza lecondzile).""  This translates to: ""People began to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of **Homo Erectus** (meaning upright man).""

While the passage mentions other species walked upright, *Homo Erectus* is specifically identified as the species that *began* walking upright two million years ago.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I-Sahelanthropus:** The passage suggests *Sahelanthropus* *might* have walked upright very early on (7 million years ago), but doesn't state it was a common practice.
*   **C: Tigcweti te-Bipedal:** This translates to ""Bipedal creatures"". It's a *description* of how they walk, not a specific animal.
*   **D: I-Australopithecus:** The passage says *Australopithecus* developed walking upright as a habit, and evidence of their bipedalism exists from even earlier than *Homo Erectus*, but they weren't the *first* to do so according to the text."
Yini lebeyizama kufezwa mabutho etimpi asemantini aseJalimani phakatsi nempi yelive yesibili?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuvimbela iBritain kutsi yamukele bantfu netimphahla**.

Here's why:

The passage states that German soldiers were ""trying to block shipments"" (meaning people and goods) while America was trying to send things to Britain across the Atlantic. This clearly indicates their goal was to *prevent* Britain from receiving aid.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kivimba timphahla letibuya eBritain** - The passage focuses on blocking shipments *to* Britain, not from it.
*   **C: Tintfo letithutswa tincamule I-Atlatic** - While things *did* sink, that was a consequence of the blocking effort, not the primary goal.
*   **D: Kuvimbela Imelika kutsi yamukele bantfu netimphahla** - The Germans were focused on stopping Britain from receiving aid, not preventing America from sending it.

Ngalokusekelwe elwatini loluniketwe endzimeni lophumelele kakhulu ngetimpi taselwandle phakatsi nemkhankaso weNyakatho ye-Atlantic?,"The correct answer is **A: Ema-Britain kanye NemaMelika**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Americans were trying to get supplies *to* Britain, and that Britain was successfully evading the German U-boats. This implies both countries were successful in their roles within the North Atlantic campaign – the US in attempting to deliver and Britain in surviving to receive.  The passage highlights the difficulty the Germans had in completely stopping the flow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: EmaJalimani:** The text says they were *trying* to impede shipping, but ultimately weren’t completely successful in stopping it.
* **C: EmaJalimani kanye nema-Britain:** While both were involved, the passage emphasizes Britain's success in evading and America's efforts to deliver.
* **D: Ema-Britain:** While Britain was successful in evading, the US effort to *provide* was also a key part of the success.



"
Kungani belingekho lapho ema-Assyrian acalisa kusebentiswa kwe-Calvary?,"The correct answer is **A: Emahhashi** (Horses).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Cishe ngemnyaka wa-1000 B.C., ema-Asiriya enta impi yekucala yamasosha lalwa agibele emahhashi."" which translates to ""Around 1000 B.C., the Assyrians waged the first war of soldiers fighting on horseback.""  The passage then explains what ""calvary"" means – soldiers mounted on horses. 

Therefore, the Assyrians began using cavalry *because* of horses. The other options don't fit the context of the passage explaining the *introduction* of cavalry.



"
Tinjani timpi letisebentisa i-Calvary?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngelihhashi**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that ""calvary"" refers to soldiers who fought *on horseback*. It describes the Assyrians as being the first to use cavalry in warfare, meaning they fought using horses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngetinyawo** - Cavalry doesn't fight on foot.
*   **B: Ngaphandle kwesikhali** - Soldiers, especially in ancient warfare, always had weapons.
*   **D: Nemasotja lamancane** - The text doesn't mention anything about smaller soldiers being part of the cavalry.



"
"Ngekusho kwesicephu, bowungeke suitable sakhamuti sase-Babylonian lesivamile?","The correct answer is **C: Umcimbi logcekeni lelithempeli** (A ceremony in the temple courtyard).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bantfu bebaletsa iminikelo kulabonkulunkulu bese baphristi betama kunaka letidzingo tabonkulunkulu basebentisa **imicimbi kanye netikhatsi tekukhumbula lokutsite**."" This translates to ""People would bring offerings to the gods, and priests would tend to the needs of the gods and use **ceremonies and rituals**.""
* This indicates that participating in or observing ceremonies within the temple was a common practice.
* The passage specifically mentions the open courtyard where activities happened.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Kuletsa imihlantjelo egcekeni lelithempeli** (Bringing offerings to the temple courtyard) – While people *brought* offerings, the question asks what a *common person* would *do*. Bringing offerings was part of the process *leading up to* a ceremony, not the ceremony itself.
* **B: Kuhambela umcimbi ethampelini lekucala** (Attending a ceremony for the first time) – The passage doesn't suggest anything about first-time attendees, just participation in ceremonies generally.
* **D: Baletsa imihlatjelo endlini lencwele lephakatsi** (Making offerings in the community sacred house) –  The passage specifically states offerings were made *to the gods* at the *temple*, not a general ""community sacred house."" Also, only priests entered the inner sanctum.



"
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lobekuhloselwe bafundisi ngalokukhetsekile?,"The correct answer is **B: Tindzawo taphakatsi letincwele** (Sacred places of worship).

Here's why:

The passage states ""bese kuba kungekhatsi lekungena kuyo umpristi kuphela"" - meaning there was a special area only the priest could enter. This indicates a dedicated, sacred space for religious practice, which aligns with ""sacred places of worship.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Imikhosi (Ceremonies)** - While ceremonies *happened* at the temple, they weren't the place *reserved* for priests.
* **C: Imicimbi (Events)** - Similar to A, events occurred at the temple, but the restricted area wasn't *for* events generally.
* **D: Ema-Ziggurats (Ziggurats)** - Ziggurats were *part* of the temple complex, not the area specifically for priests. The passage says the top of the Ziggurat was a special holy place for the god, but doesn’t mention the priests exclusively using it.



"
Inkosi Tutankhamun waluzuza nini ludumo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngemuva kwekutholwa kwelithuna lakhe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kutfolakala kwelithuna lakhe nga-1922 kwamenta waba ngulodvumile."" This translates to ""The discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kulandzela kwebiwa kwelitje lasethuneni lakhe** - The passage doesn't mention anything about looting before the full discovery.
*   **B: Phakatsi nekubusa kwakhe** - The passage says he wasn't considered important *during* his reign.
*   **D: Ngemuva kwekushiwo eluhlwini lemakhosi asendvulo** - He wasn't recorded in the list of ancient kings, so this isn't the reason for his fame."
Yini leyenta Inkosi Tutankhamun waba yinkosi yaseGibhithe leyatiwa kakhulu?,"The correct answer is **A: Kutfolakala kwelithula lakhe lelingakaphatamiswa** (The discovery of his undisturbed tomb).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kutfolakala kwelithuna lakhe nga-1922 kwamenta waba ngulodvumile."" (The discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous).  It specifically highlights that *because* his tomb was found nearly intact, it made him so well-known.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Simo sakhe ehlwini lemakhosi asendvulo** (His position in the list of ancient kings) - The passage actually says he wasn't considered very important and wasn't listed prominently.
*   **C: Kuphangwa kwetinkhulungwane tetintfo tebuciko ethuneni laphe** (The finding of thousands of art objects in the tomb) - While true, this is a *result* of the tomb's discovery, not the reason *why* he became famous.
*   **D: Kubaluleka kwakhe ngetikhatsi taseGibhithe lasendvulo** (His importance in ancient Egyptian times) - The passage suggests he wasn't particularly important *during* his life. His fame came *after* the tomb was found.



"
Yini imbongi yem-Greek lengu-Homer lengakwati kukwenta?,"The correct answer is **D: Khuluma**.

Here's why:

The passage states Homer was a ""losonkondlo loyimphuphutse"" which translates to ""famous poet"". Poets *speak* (or rather, write to be spoken) through their poetry. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vani** (Hear) - While people *hear* Homer's poetry, he is the one *creating* it.
* **B: Bona** (See) - The passage doesn't mention anything about Homer's sight.
* **C: Hamba** (Walk) - The passage focuses on his literary abilities, not his physical ones.



"
Ngumuphi um-Greek lodvumile lowatiwa ngalokunye ngaphandle kwetincwadzi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngu-Pythagorus**.

Here's why:

*   The text states Pythagoras is famous for a *theorem* (a mathematical principle), not writings like Homer, Sophocles, and Aristophanes. The question asks for someone famous for something *other* than writing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngu-Sophocles:** He is described as a playwright (writes plays/books).
*   **B: Ngu-Homer:** He is described as writing the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey*.
*   **D: Ngu-Aristophanes:** He is also described as a playwright.



"
Umndeni wema Hebrew usicitsa kuphi sikhatsi sawo lesiningi?,"The correct answer is **C: Egcekeni** (In the courtyard).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kaningi imphilo yemndeni wemaHebheru yentaka ebaleni."" which translates to ""Much of the Hebrew family's life was outside in the courtyard.""  It then details activities happening *in* the courtyard - women cooking, clothes being hung to dry, and trees providing wood. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Emoyeni lovulekile** (In the open air) - While activities happened *in* the open air, the specific location mentioned is the courtyard.
*   **B: Endleleni** (On the road) - The text doesn't mention spending time on the road.
*   **D: Endlini** (Inside the house) - The text specifically contrasts life *outside* in the courtyard with the house, implying the house wasn't the primary living space.



"
Yini lebeyingakabaluleki kakhulu emndenini wema Hebrew?,"The correct answer is **A: Simo sabo selitulu** (Their house/dwelling).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Endzaweni leshisako yaseMphumalanga Lesekhatsi, **indlu bekungasiyo intfo lebaluleke kangako.**""  This translates to ""In the ancient Near East, **a house was not something so important.**"" 

The passage then goes on to describe how much of family life *happened* around the home (cooking, stories, building materials came from it), implying it was the *center of life* even if the structure itself wasn't prized. Therefore, the state of their dwelling was paramount.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tindzaba tabo (Their stories):** While stories were told *in* the home, the passage doesn't suggest they were the least important thing.
* **C: Imiti yabo (Their medicine):**  Medicine isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Kupheka kwabo (Their cooking):** Cooking happened *in* the house, and is highlighted as a key activity, making it *important*, not unimportant.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakachazwa njengemehluko phakatsi kwemave Scandinavian?,"The correct answer is **B: Lendzawo**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Noma lelo nalelo lalamave 'belingelemaScandinavia', bekunemehluko leminengi emkhatsini **kwebantfu, emakhosi, imihambo nemlandvo** weSweden, iNorway ne-Iceland."" 

This means differences existed in people, rulers, customs, and history.  ""Lendzawo"" (location) isn't mentioned as a differentiating factor in the passage. While there *are* geographical differences between these countries, the passage doesn't highlight that as a *difference* between the Scandinavian cultures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lomlandvo (History):** The text directly mentions differences in history.
*   **C: Lamasiko (Customs):** The text directly mentions differences in customs/traditions (""imihambo"").
*   **D: Labantfu (People):** The text directly mentions differences in people.



"
Ngubani lowahlala e-Greenland kucala?,"The correct answer is **A: Tive tema-Eskimo**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kepha ngale kwetintfo latitfolile, sive sema-Eskimo besesivele siphila lapho ngaleso sikhatsi."" This translates to ""But despite these discoveries, the Eskimo people were already living there at that time.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bantfu base-Norway** - While Erik the Red (from Norway) *discovered* Greenland for the Norse, the text says the Eskimo were already there.
*   **C: Erik Lobovu** - Erik the Red *settled* in Greenland, but didn't live there first.
*   **D: Bantfu base-Sweden** - The text mentions Sweden as being different from Norway and Iceland, but doesn't state Swedes lived in Greenland first.

Nguliphi licembu lelingatsandza kudla ngaphandle kwetihlalo?,"The correct answer is **A: Bafati baseRoma labacebile**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""njengoba bantfu labaphuyile nebafati badla kudla kwabo bahleti etitulweni, tinjinga titsandza kwenta siphihli selidzili tindzawonye tihleli tingcebelekile njengobe tidla kudla kwato."" This translates to ""as slaves and *women* ate their food separately at tables, fingers tended to make a mess as they ate with their hands.""  The context implies that wealthy women would be the ones dining separately and therefore eating in this manner.  The passage contrasts this with how people generally ate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Emandvodza aseRoma lahluphekile:** The passage mentions slaves eating separately, but doesn't specify they were men.
*   **C: Emadvodza eseRoma lacebile:** The passage specifically mentions women, not men.
*   **D: Bafati baseRoma labahluphekile:** The context suggests the practice was more common among the wealthy who could afford separate dining arrangements.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lobekungeke kube yincenye yemkhosi wemaRoma asendvulo?,"The correct answer is **D: Sitja selikalikhuni lelosiwe** (Roasted potato).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that potatoes were *not* part of the ancient Roman diet. They arrived in Europe from the Americas hundreds of years later. 

Let's look at why the other options are plausible based on the text:

*   **A: Tivakashi letihluphekile tidla etitulwini** (Injured veterans eat reclining) - The text mentions that injured men and women ate reclining at meals.
*   **B: I-appetizer yeminenke** (A dormouse appetizer) - The text specifically lists dormice as a food enjoyed by the Romans.
*   **C: Emadvodza lacebile alala phasi ngesikhatsi sesidlo santsambama** (Rich men lie down during a banquet) - The text says wealthy Romans ate reclining.

"Ngalokusekelwe endzimeni, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungenteka kube nemtselela lohlala njalo?","The correct answer is **A: Umphakatsi (Society)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Imphucuko ilisiko lelihlanganyelwa licembu lelikhulu lebantfu labahlala futsi basebente ndzawonye endzaweni letsite."" which translates to ""Culture is a system practiced by a large group of people who live and work together in a specific area."" This directly links culture to the existence of a *society* – a group of people living together. 

The passage further explains the origin of ""Imphucuko"" (culture) comes from Latin words relating to citizens and cities, emphasizing its connection to organized communities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lisiko lelincane (Small culture):** The passage specifically mentions these *disappearing* and not being lasting.
* **C: Sifundza lesitimele (Small area):** While culture exists *within* areas, the area itself isn't the lasting element, but the people and their practices.
* **D: Lisiko lemphucuko (Culture of civilization):** This is too specific. The passage discusses culture in general, not just that of a ""civilized"" society.



"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, yini leyandvulela sive?","The correct answer is **A: Lisiko lemphucuko** (The culture of civilization).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kuphucuka kwemhlaba kusuka eLatin civilis, lokusho tidzingo temphakatsi, lokubhekisela eLatin civis, lokusho takhamuti, lokusho lidolobha, loko ngandlela tsite kuchaza linani lalesive."" This translates to: ""Civilization originates from the Latin 'civilis,' meaning societal needs, referring to the Latin 'civis,' meaning citizen, meaning city, which directly defines the size of a civilization."" 

Therefore, the passage directly links *civilization* (lisiko lemphucuko) to the formation and definition of a society/civilization (sive).



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Lisiko lelilodvwa** (A single culture): The passage emphasizes the *combination* of cultures, not a single one.
*   **C: Sifundza lesitimele** (A small place): While small places are *within* a civilization, they don't *create* it.
*   **D: Emasiko lamancane** (Small cultures): The passage says these are fragile and can disappear without being recorded, suggesting they don't define a civilization."
Ngusiphi sitatimende lesingasilo liciniso mayelana ne-Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **C: Umlilo umoshe tinsalela letiningi tale-Castle**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the fire in 1951 *left ruins only* of Drukgyal Dzong, meaning most of the castle was destroyed. Option C implies significant remains were left, which contradicts the text.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Yakhelwe kugubha kuncoba kwemabutho aseTibetan-Mongol** - The passage states Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built it to commemorate his victory against Tibetan-Mongol armies.
*   **B: Itfolakala eBhuthan** - The passage says it’s one of Bhutan's landmarks.
*   **D: Yadalwa ngu Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel** - The passage explicitly states Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the fortress.



"
Ngusiphi sitatimende lesichaza ngalokungiko umphumela wemlilo Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **A: Intfo lesele bekumfanekiso waZhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal** (The only thing that remained was the portrait of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Nga-1951, umlilo wabangela kutsi kusale tinsalela kuphela taseDrukgyal Dzong, njengalesitfombe saZhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal."" (In 1951, a fire caused only remnants to remain at Drukgyal Dzong, such as the portrait of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Emabutho aTibetan-Mongol ancobile** (Tibetan-Mongol armies conquered) - The passage mentions battles with them previously, but not as a result of the fire.
* **C: Kutsandvwa lokukhangako akumange kutsintseke** (The valued attraction has not yet been restored) - While the fortress was later preserved, the passage doesn't focus on restoration *immediately* after the fire.
* **D: Yalondvolotwa nguZhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel** (It was built by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel) - The passage states he *built* the fortress, not that it was a result of the fire.



"
Ngusiphi sitatimende lesilandzelako lesiliciniso mayelana ne-Cambodia?,"The correct answer is **D: Bantfu baseThailand babhubhise iPhnom Phen**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Base-Thai bangena eCambodia tikhatsi letinyenti ngelikhulu lesi-18 futsi nga-1772 babhubhise iPhnom Phen."" (The Thai entered Cambodia many times in the 18th century and in 1772 they destroyed Phnom Phen).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: EmaVietnames abhubhise Phnom Phen** - The text says Vietnamese *entered* Cambodia towards the end of the century, but doesn't mention them destroying Phnom Phen.
*   **B: I-Cambodia ihlasele iThailand ngo 1772** - The text says the opposite: Thai people entered and attacked Cambodia.
*   **C: I-Cambodia yahlaselwa i-Vietnam ekucaleni kwemakhulu langu-18 eminyaka** - The text states Vietnam entered towards the *end* of the 18th century, not the beginning.



"
Ngutiphi titatmende letilandzelako letichaza ngalokungiko kuhlaselwa kwe-Cambodia?,"The correct answer is **B: Bantfu baseThailand kanye nebaseVietnam bahlasele iCambodia ngo 1772**.

Here's why:

*   The text specifically states that the Thai invaded Cambodia multiple times in the 18th century *and* that in 1772 they sacked Phnom Penh. It also says Vietnam invaded Cambodia towards the end of the 18th century.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I-Vietnam ihlasele iCambodia kaningi** - The text says Vietnam invaded towards the *end* of the century, not necessarily multiple times.
*   **C: EmaVietnames abhubhise Phnom Phen** - The text states the *Thai* sacked Phnom Penh, not the Vietnamese.
*   **D: Bantfu baseThailand bahlasele iCambodia kaningi** - While true, it doesn’t include the Vietnamese involvement, which is also mentioned in the text.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lengakakhoni kukwenta ngesikhatsi ise-Taiwan I-Dutch East India Company?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngekutimisela kuyekela kulawula iTaiwan ebukhosini baka-Qing**.

Here's why:

The text states the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan in 1624. It also mentions they exploited indigenous labor and used Chinese workers.  However, the text describes the Qing dynasty *taking* control of Taiwan in 1683, not the Dutch *voluntarily* giving it up.  The Dutch were overtaken by the Qing, they didn't willingly relinquish control.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: Banesizindza encenyeni leseningizimu-ntshonalanga yesichingi** - The text says they ""icalisa sisekelo eningizimu-nshonalanga neTaiwan"" (established a base in southwestern Taiwan).
*   **B: Kutijwayeta kukhicita lokusanhlavu kwemdzabu** - The text states they ""yacalisa lushintjo lendlela yekukhicita lokusanhlavu kwemdzabu"" (began to exploit indigenous labor).
*   **C: Casha tisebenti taseChina emasimini ayo** - The text says they ""yacasha tisebenti taseShayina kusebenta emasimini ayo erayisi newashukela"" (employed Chinese laborers in its rice and sugar fields).



"
Yini leyasungulwa sivumelwano sase-Shimonoseki?,"The correct answer is **D: Ligunya lase-Japan ngetulu kwe-Taiwan**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that the Treaty of Shimonoseki ""agreed to cede Taiwan to Japanese rule."" This means Japan was granted authority over Taiwan as a result of the treaty.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuncotjwa kweJapan empini yekucala yema-Sino-Japanese** - While Japan *won* the war, the treaty was the result of that win, not the victory itself.
*   **B: Simo se-Taiwan njengesifundzave ngaphasi kwebukhosi baka-Qing** - The text states Taiwan *became* a province of the Qing dynasty *before* the treaty, not as a result of it.
*   **C: Likhono le-Taiwan lekubuyisela emuva kulawula tindzawo tayo leyisegwini** - The treaty did not give Taiwan more control over its coastal areas; it took control *from* the Qing dynasty.



"
Likalwa njani lizinga lekhemikhali I-pH?,"The correct answer is **C: Linani lema-ions Hydrogen kukhemikhali**.

The text explicitly states: ""Lizinga le-pH livetwa linani le-Hydrogen (H ku-pH) ions kumakhemikhali lahloliwe."" (The pH level is determined by the number of Hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the chemical being tested.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While pH *indicates* if a chemical is acidic or basic, the pH *is* the measurement of hydrogen ions, not the categorization itself.
*   **B:** The number of protons isn't directly the pH - it's the *free hydrogen ions* (protons without electrons) that matter.
*   **D:** The number of electrons is relevant to the atom itself but not the pH level of a chemical."
Yini leyasuswa kuma-ions Hydrogen?,"The correct answer is **D: Ema-Electron**.

The passage states: ""Emahydrogen ions ngemaprothoni lasuswe ema-elekthroni awo..."" which translates to ""Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed."" 

Therefore, hydrogen ions are formed when electrons are removed from hydrogen atoms."
Ngutiphi kuletinkhulumo letilandzelako letingakuchazi kahle kutidla kwemabhubesi?,"The correct answer is **D: Totibili tiyabulala futsi tiyahlalisana**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Licembu lemabhubesi lenta njengelicembu letimphisi, noma tinja, tilwane leticishe tifane nemabhubesi (kodvwa hhayi emakati lamakhulu) ngekutiphatsa, kantsi futsi **tiyabulala uma titingela**."" (The group of lions acts like a pack of jackals or dogs, animals similar to lions (but not big cats) in behavior, and also **they kill when hunting**.)  It also says they live together (""aphila ndzawonye"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Titiphatsa ngendlela lefana nemaphaketi etinja** (They behave like packs of dogs) - While the passage *compares* their behavior to dogs, it doesn't specifically focus on *how* they hunt.
* **B: Silinganiso salomdvuna nawesifazane asilingani** (The ratio of males to females is unequal) - The passage mentions the numbers of males and females but doesn't state if the ratio is unequal, only that there are fewer males.
* **C: Labadvuna nabesifazane bonkhe bahlobene dvute** (All males and females are closely related) - The passage states the *lionesses* are closely related, not necessarily *all* lions in the pride.



"
Ngutiphi tinkhulumo kuleti letilandzelako letingakuchazi kahle kutiphatsa kwemabhubesi?,"The correct answer is **B: Indlela latiphatsa nagyo iyefana neyetimphisi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""Licembu lemabhubesi lenta njengelicembu letimphisi...ngekutiphatsa"" which translates to ""A group of lions acts like a pack of hyenas...in terms of behavior.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Abantfu kakhulu emphakatsini** (Many people in the community) - This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Kokubili lamadvuna nawesifazane kuyingoti kakhulu etilwaneni** (Both males and females are very important in the hunt) - While the passage mentions both are involved, it doesn’t focus on their *behavior* specifically. It focuses on the size of each group.
* **D: Kutiphatsa kwawo kuyafana nalamanye emakati lamakhulu** (Their behavior is similar to other big cats) - The passage explicitly states they behave *like hyenas*, not other big cats, and points out hyenas are *not* big cats.



"
Bonogwaja basisulu lesivamile saluphi luhlobo letilwane letiyingelako?,"The correct answer is **D: Tinyamatane**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngephansi kwato kunaletiningi tinhlobo letisemkhatsini ngekwakheka tabokati letidla **tinyamatane** letisemkhatsini ngekwakheka...""  This directly translates to ""Under the boat there are many types of creatures, including cats that eat **beetles**...""

The question asks what a common prey of *bonogwaja* (which are cats in this context) is. The passage identifies tinyamatane (beetles) as prey for these cats.



"
Emakati lamancane ngalokuvamile atingela kuphi kulokulandzelako?,"The correct answer is **A: Emagundvwane**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""...emakati lamanyenti lamancane ... ladla tilwane letincane njengetilokatana, **emagundvwane**, imigololo, netinyoni."" ( ...small wild cats ... eat small animals such as lizards, **frogs**, snails, and birds.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bonogwaja** - The text mentions bonogwaja as prey for larger animals, not specifically for the small cats.
*   **C: Tinyamatane** - Tinyamatane are mentioned as prey for the animals *under* the boat, not the small cats.
*   **D: Inyamatane** - Inyamatane (deer) are too large for small cats to reliably hunt.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungasiyo incenye yendlela yekutingela ema-ocelot?,"The correct answer is **C: Kulandzela inyamatane yabo ebusuku**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tingabona kahle ebumnyameni ngembono wasebusuku, bese tiyanyenya."" (They can see well in the dark with night vision, and then stalk.) This means they *use* their night vision to stalk, not specifically to *follow* prey at night.  The focus is on the ability to see in the dark *while* stalking.

Let's look at why the other options *are* part of ocelot hunting:

* **A: Kubhaca endzaweni letitungetile (To stalk in bushy areas):** The passage says ""Tingabona kahle ebumnyameni ngembono wasebusuku, bese tiyanyenya."" (They can see well in the dark with night vision, and then stalk.)
* **B: Kulandzela liphunga lenyamatane yabo (To follow the scent of their prey):** The passage states ""Bososayensi batsi emakati esiganga alandzela tilwane atibambe kuze atidle (tinyamatane letitingelwako) ngekutsi ative ngeliphunga, anukise kuze eve kutsi betikuphi."" (Scientists say wild cats follow animals to catch them to eat (prey) by smelling and sniffing to find out where they are.)
* **D: Kutingela kuphela tilwane letinesayizi lencane (To only hunt small animals):** The passage says ""Cishe tonkhe letilwane ema-ocelot lakatitingelako tincane kakhulu kunawo."" (Almost all the animals ocelots hunt are much smaller than them.)



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungachazi kahle i-ocelot? ,"The correct answer is **B: Tinyakata ngalokuthulile**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""bese tiyanyenya"" which means they *stalk* or *creep* – they don't move quietly, they actively stalk their prey. The passage describes them pouncing and digging, not silent movement.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Tikhona kutingela kahle ebusuku** - The passage says ""Tingabona kahle ebumnyameni ngembono wasebusuku"" (They can see well in the dark with night vision).
* **C: Imiva yato yekunuka ibutsakatsaka** - The passage states ""bososayensi batsi...alandzela tilwane atibambe kuze atidle (tinyamatane letitingelwako) ngekutsi ative ngeliphunga, anukise kuze eve kutsi betikuphi"" (scientists say...they follow animals to catch and eat them by activating their sense of smell, sniffing to feel where they are).
* **D: Tikhetsa kutingela tilwane letincane** - The passage starts with ""Ema-ocelots atsandza kudla tilwane letincane"" (Ocelots prefer to eat small animals) and details what small animals they hunt.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungeke kubukwe njengemandla lamakhulu engwe?,"The correct answer is **B: Kunwabhela**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a leopard's powerful actions: climbing, roaring, marking territory, and powerfully attacking.  These all demonstrate strength. ""Kunwabhela"" (to play) doesn't fit the description of a leopard's formidable abilities and is the least indicative of its power.

Let's look at why the other options *are* linked to the leopard's strength as described in the passage:

*   **Kubhodla (to pounce):** The passage specifically states leopards can pounce powerfully.
*   **Kuzuba (to roar):**  The passage mentions the leopard roaring.
*   **Kudvonsa (to attack):** The passage describes the leopard attacking with force five times a strong man.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngumuphi umehluko phakatsi kwetingwe nemabhubesi?","The correct answer is **B: Umsindvo wekubhodla kwato (The sound of its roar)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Indlela lihlosi lelibhodla ngayo ayifanani naleyo lephakeme libhubesi lelibhodla ngayo, kodvwa libhodla ngendlela lekhombisa kutsi litfukutsele."" (The way the leopard roars is different from the way the lion roars, but it roars in a way that shows it is angry.)

This directly highlights a difference in *how* they roar – the sound of their roars.  The other options are not mentioned as a distinguishing feature in the text.



"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, Robert Hooke wentani ngaphambi kwaletinye tati tetintfo letiphilako?","The correct answer is **A: Caphela ema-cell afile** (Observed dead cells).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ngumuntfu wekucala lowabona emangcamuzana lafile."" (He was the first person to see dead cells).  He observed these cells in cork, which is a dead plant material.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sebentisa sibonakhulu kute ubuke intfo lephilako** (Used a microscope to look at living things) - While he *used* a microscope, he didn't initially observe living things.
* **C: Caphela tikwele letincane** (Observed small squares) - He observed what *looked like* small squares, but he was actually looking at dead cell walls.
* **D: Titfolele emayunithi lamancane kakhulu lasebentako entfo lephilako** (Discovered the very small functional units of living things) - He didn't discover the functional units (which are cells themselves). He saw the remnants of cells.



"
Shano kutsi imvelaphi yeligama lelitsi “cell” isho kutsini?,"The correct answer is **B: Likamelo lelincane**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ingcamuza ligama lesitsatselwa kwelesiLathini lelitsi cella lelisho likamelo lelincane."" This directly translates to ""The word 'cell' is derived from Latin 'cella' which means a small room.""  Robert Hooke compared what he saw under the microscope to small rooms, hence the name.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, tilwane letiningi tinelukhono lekwentani?","The correct answer is **D: Gubha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tiyagubha emhlabatsini..."" which translates to ""They dig in the ground...""  This directly answers the question about what many animals are capable of doing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Phapha** (Run) - While many animals *can* run, the passage doesn't specifically state this as a common ability.
*   **B: Nyakata** (Swim) - The passage mentions animals swimming in the ocean, but doesn't say *many* animals can swim.
*   **C: Bhukuta** (Fly) - The passage mentions animals flying, but doesn't say *many* animals can fly.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngutiphi tilwane letingena?","The correct answer is **A: Ema-cell**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tilwane kuphela letinetingcondvo (nomanje kungasito tonkhe tilwane letinayo; ijellyfish, ngekwesibonelo, ite ingcondvo)."" This translates to ""Animals only have brains (although not all animals have them; jellyfish, for example, do not have brains).""

The passage is defining a characteristic of animals – the presence of cells that form brains. The other options are functions or abilities *within* animals, not what defines them as animals.

*   **B: Lukhono lekugaya (Ability to digest):** Many things can digest, not just animals.
*   **C: Bucopho (Breathing):** Again, not exclusive to animals.
*   **D: Lukhono lekudla (Ability to eat):**  Like digesting, many organisms eat.



"
Yini lesita titjalo enchubeni ye-photosynthesis?,"The correct answer is **D: Lilanga**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tihlahla tenta kudla kwato ngekusitwa **lilanga** ngenchubo lebitwa ngekutsi yi-photoynthesis."" This directly translates to ""Trees make food with the help of **sunlight** through a process called photosynthesis.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sitfunti (Water):** While water is *necessary* for photosynthesis, the text doesn't say it *helps* the plant in the process, sunlight does.
*   **B: Tilwane (Animals):** Animals don't help with photosynthesis.
*   **C: Kudla (Food):** Food is a *result* of photosynthesis, not something that helps it happen.



"
Yini lena bantfu labayikhiphako ihogelwe tigjalo?,"The correct answer is **B: Umoya lohlantekile (Clean air)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tihlahla tikhicita umoya mphilo lophefumulwa bantfu, tona titsatse umoya lophuma ebantfwini lobitwa ngekutsi yi-carbon-dioxide (lokhishwa bantfu).""  This translates to: ""Trees clean the air breathed by people, and they absorb the air that comes from people called carbon-dioxide (exhaled by people).""

Therefore, trees take in what people exhale and give back clean air. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kudla (Food):** While trees *provide* food, they don't *take in* food from people.
*   **C: Emanti (Water):** Trees use water, but don't specifically take in exhaled air for water.
*   **D: Umoya longcolile (Dirty air):** Trees clean the air, they don't take in dirty air to keep it.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngisiphi kuletibonelo letilandzelako lesingatsiya inchubo yekutiphendvukela kwemvelo?","The correct answer is **A: Licembu lelincane lelihlulekako kuchuma endzaweni lesha** (A small group failing to thrive in a new environment).

Here's why:

The passage describes **speciation** as a result of a small group becoming isolated from the main population. This isolation leads to the small group needing to adapt to a new environment with different challenges.  This adaptation over time results in them becoming a distinct species. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Incenye yemuntfu munye lotfutsela endzaweni lesha** (A portion of one person relocating to a new environment) - This refers to a single individual, not a breeding population needed for speciation.
* **C: Sibalo sebatfu lesilungisa kutayela kwayo endzaweni lesha** (A number of animals adjusting to its new environment) - Adjustment is part of the process, but doesn't *cause* speciation itself. It’s the isolation *and* the need to adapt differently that leads to a new species.
* **D: Sibalo sinye sigcine senta lababili** (A single number remaining of both groups) - This simply describes a population decline, not the divergence necessary for speciation.



The passage explicitly states that speciation happens when a small group is *isolated* and then must adapt to a *different environment* to survive. Option A best reflects this core concept."
Ngusiphi sitatimende lesilandzelako lesingachazi kahle inchubo ye-speciation? ,"The correct answer is **A: Kwenteka lapho linani lebantfu labasha lingakwati kuvumelana netimo.**

Here's why:

* **Speciation** isn't *about* adapting to conditions. Adaptation happens *during* the speciation process, but the core of speciation is the *splitting* of one population into two that become increasingly distinct. The text emphasizes the *isolation* and subsequent differences that arise, leading to the inability to be considered the same species.  Adapting is a *result* of the isolation, not the definition of it.

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct according to the text:

* **B: Kuyincenye lebalulekile yenchubo yekutiphendvukela kwemvelo** - The passage explicitly states: ""I-speciation yimbangela lengagwemeki futsi yincenye lebalulekile yekutiphendvukela kwemvelo."" (Speciation is an unavoidable cause and an important part of evolution).
* **C: Kubukiselwa ekwakhiweni kweluhlobo lolusha** -  The passage defines speciation as ""kwakhiwa kwetinhlobo letinsha"" (the creation of new species).
* **D: Kwenyeka kwayo akunakugwenywa** -  The passage states: ""I-speciation yimbangala lengagwemeki"" (speciation is an unavoidable cause).



"
Nguyiphi incenye yesimiso sekujikeleta kwengati leletsa ingati enhlitiyweni?,"The correct answer is **A: Imitsambo yengati**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ingati isuka enhlitiyweni ngemitsambo yengati letibitwa ngekutsi ema-arteries..."" (Blood leaves the heart through blood vessels called arteries...).  This directly links blood vessels (imitsambo yengati) to carrying blood *to* the heart.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ema-Capillary:** Capillaries are tiny blood vessels where exchange happens, not the primary vessels *leading to* the heart.
* **C: Titfo temtimba:** This translates to ""body tissues"" - not vessels carrying blood.
* **D: Imitsambo:** This is a general term for vessels, but ""imitsambo yengati"" (blood vessels) is more specific and accurate to the passage's context.



"
Nguwaphi emashubhu lamancane kakhulu ehlelweni lekujikeleta kwengati?,"The correct answer is **A: Ema-Capillary**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Imitsambo yengati lemincane ibitwa ngekutsi ema-capillaries."" (The small blood vessels are called capillaries.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Imitsambo yengati** - This is a general term for blood vessels (arteries and veins).
* **C: Imitsambo** -  Also a general term for vessels, not specifically the smallest ones.
* **D: Titfo temtimba** - This translates to ""body tissues"" and isn't related to blood vessels.



"
Lukhono letinambutane lekugoba emaphiko ayo emuva ikhulisa ngukuphi lokulandzelako?,"The correct answer is **B: Indzawo yekubhaca** (Space for stinging/biting).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Loku kubaniketa indzawo levulekile lenetindzawana letincane tekubhacela bahlaseli."" This directly translates to ""This gives them open space with small parts to sting attackers.""  Therefore, the ability to fold their wings provides a space for stinging/biting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuphakela kudla** (Finding food) - While wings help find food, the passage links the wing folding *directly* to defense, not food acquisition.
*   **C: Kutfola bangani** (Finding friends) - The text doesn't mention anything about finding friends.
*   **D: Sivinini sendiza** (Flying speed) - The text states wings *help* them fly, but the folding is related to something else - creating space for biting.

Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakashiwo endzimeni njengetfo likhono lekuphapha kwetinambutane?,"The correct answer is **B: Budze bemphilo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Likhono lato lekutindiza litisita kutsi tibalekele titsa tato kalula futsi titfole kudla futsi tikhwelane kahle."" This translates to ""This ability to fly helps them escape their enemies easily and find food and reproduce well.""  This directly links flying to *survival* and thriving - which is the essence of **budze bemphilo** (life skills/survival skills).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kukhicita kabusha (Replication/Reproduction):** While flying *helps* with reproduction, the passage doesn't focus on replication as the primary benefit of flight.
* **C: Kugcogca kudla (Finding food):**  Finding food is *a* benefit, but not the overarching reason for the evolution of flight as presented in the text.
* **D: Kusebenta kahle (Working well/Efficiency):**  Too broad. While flying makes things more efficient, it doesn't capture the core purpose as well as survival.



"
Nguyiphi tici letilandzelako letingakavami kusebentiswa nema-dinosaurs?,"The correct answer is **B: Tinsiba**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Labanyenti bantfu abawacabangi njengema-dinosaur ngoba anensiba..."" (Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers). This directly contrasts with dinosaurs *not* having feathers, making feathers the less common characteristic associated with dinosaurs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuhamba ngemlente lomnyama** - This doesn't relate to the passage.
*   **C: Kubeka emacandza** - The passage states birds lay eggs, which is similar to dinosaurs.
*   **D: Tinyawo letinetinzipho** - The passage specifically mentions birds have scaled feet, similar to dinosaurs.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakavami kubukwa njengesici lesabiwe setinyoni nema-dinosaurs?,"The correct answer is **C: Likhono lekundiza** (The ability to fly).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that people *don't* think of birds as dinosaurs because they can fly. It highlights that despite this difference, many other characteristics link birds to dinosaurs. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kubeka macandza (Laying eggs):** The passage mentions birds lay eggs, just like dinosaurs.
*   **B: Kusebentisa tinyawo letimbili tasemuva kuhamba (Using two legs to walk):** The passage specifically says birds walk on two legs like the T-Rex.
*   **D: Tinyawo ngetindzipho (Feet with claws):** The passage states birds have feet with claws, a characteristic shared with dinosaurs.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, nguyiphi incenye yesitjalo se-cycad lokungenteka idle i-Triceratops?","The correct answer is **A: Emacembe enaso**.

The passage states: ""I-Triceratops kungenteka isebentise umlomo wayo lonemandla kukhipha **emacembe** ngembi kwekudla umtimba wesihlahla."" (Triceratops could have used its powerful beak to pull out **cones** rather than eating the body of the tree.) 

Therefore, the passage specifically mentions Triceratops potentially eating the cones of the cycad plants."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi lokulandzelako lokungenteka kutsi i-Triceratops idle? ","The correct answer is **B: Sitselo lesinemagaja lacinile** (Plants with tough bark).

Here's why:

The passage states that Triceratops could have eaten not only cycads (which had tough bark) but also ""trees and shrubs with very thick bark."" This directly supports the idea that they ate plants with tough bark.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Libheja** (Meat) - The passage focuses on plant-based diets for Triceratops.
*   **C: Lipoli** (Horse) -  Triceratops is a dinosaur, not a predator that would eat a horse.
*   **D: Sitjalo lesinetitselo letinebutsi** (Plants with soft stems) - The passage highlights their ability to eat plants *with tough* bark, making soft stems unlikely.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kulemidlalo lelandzelako lekungenteka idume kakhulu etindzaweni letisenyakatho ye-Italy?","The correct answer is **C: Kugibela emabhodi esithwathweni** (Skiing).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Imidlalo yasebusika idvumile etigodzini taseNyakatfo..."" which translates to ""Winter sports are popular in the northern regions...""  Skiing is a winter sport.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ibhola letinyawo (Football/Soccer):** The passage says it's popular *generally* but doesn't specifically link it to northern Italy.
*   **B: Ivolibholi (Volleyball):**  Similar to soccer, it's generally popular, not specifically northern Italy.
*   **D: Umjaho wetimoto F1 (F1 racing):**  This is mentioned as a popular sport overall, but not specifically tied to the northern regions.



"
"Ngalokusekelwe elwatini loluniketwe endzimeni, ngumuphi kulemidlalo lelandzelako lowawina umcudzelwano wemhlaba wase-Italy?","The correct answer is **A: Ibhola yetinyawo (Football)**.

The text explicitly states: ""leli laseTaliyane laba boshampeni bemcudzelwano Wendzebe Yemhlaba nga-2006"" which translates to ""the Italian team won the World Cup in 2006"". The World Cup is a football (soccer) tournament.
"
Ngemuva kwasiphi sentakalo tincenye letitsite tase-Luxembourg taba I Belgium?,"The correct answer is **B: Kugucuka Kwebantfu Base-Belgiam** (The Belgian Revolution).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tincenye tamanje teBelgium betiyincenye yeLuxembourg esikhatsini lesendlulile kodvwa tabese tiba yiBelgian ngemuva kwa-1830 ngemuva Kwetingucuko taseBelgian.""  This translates to: ""Parts of present-day Belgium were once part of Luxembourg but became Belgian after 1830 following the Belgian Revolution.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Imphi Yelive Yekucala** (World War I) - The text mentions Luxembourg remaining neutral during both World Wars, not losing territory to Belgium during WWI.
*   **C: Imphi Yelive Yesibili** (World War II) -  Similarly, Luxembourg was occupied during WWII, but this didn't result in a transfer of territory to Belgium.
*   **D: Kutfolakala kwenyonyana yase-Europe** (The formation of the European Union) - This happened much later and doesn't explain the historical shift in territory.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokutsintse kungatsatsi luhlangotsi kwe-Luxembourg?,"The correct answer is **A: Umsebenti wase-German** (German occupation).

Here's why:

The text states: ""beliphishekile kutotimbili timphi iMphi Yelive Yekucala neMphi Yelive Yesibili eJalimane."" This directly translates to ""it suffered during both World War I and World War II in Germany."" This indicates Luxembourg was occupied by Germany, making German occupation its struggle as a small country.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kujoyina Inyonyana Yase-Europe** (Joining the European Union) - The text mentions Luxembourg *founding* the European Union, which is a positive achievement, not a struggle.
*   **C: Kugucuka Kwebantfu Base-Belgiam** (Belgian Revolution) - While the text mentions a connection to Belgium, the revolution itself wasn't Luxembourg's *struggle*.
*   **D: Kuba live lelitimele** (Being a small country) - Being small is a characteristic, not a struggle. The text describes the *consequences* of being small (being occupied), not the smallness itself as the problem.



"
Mangaki emakhilomitha Sikwele endzawo yonkhe yase-Turkey e-Europe?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The text states: ""Indzawo yaseTurkey iyenta ibe live lesi-37 lelikhulu emhlabeni wonkhe, futsi iphose ilingane neMetropolitan France kanye neBrithani kuhlangene. I-Turkey itungelwetwe lwandle etinhlangotsini letintsatfu, ngasenshonalanga lwandle i-Aegean' ngasenyakatfo lwandle iBlack, bese kuba lwandle iMediterranean ngaseningizimu. Indzawo yase-Turkey, kufaka ekhatsi emachibi, ivala 783,562 wema-square khilomitha (300,948 sq mi), ema-square khilomitha langu 755,688 (291,773 sq mi) angaseningizimu nenshonalanga ye-Asia bese nema-square khilomitha langu-**23,764 (9,174 sq mi)** eYurophu.""

Therefore, the area of Turkey in Europe is 23,764 square kilometers."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, cishe imakhilomitha lamangaki i-Turkey?","The correct answer is **A: 1600**.

The passage states: ""Indzawo yaseTurkey ingetulu ngemakhilomitha langu-1,600 (1,000 mi) budze futsi ibe ngu-800 km (500 mi) bubanti"" which translates to ""Turkey's area is over 1,600 kilometers (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide.""  Therefore, 1600 km represents the length of Turkey."
Lusetjentiswela ini lulwimi lwesi-Latini e-Vetican City?,"The correct answer is **A: Imicimbi yenkholo** (Religious ceremonies).

The text states: ""siLatin sivame kusetjentiswa emibutsanweni yetenkholo"" which translates to ""Latin is often used in religious ceremonies."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kuchumana wonkhe malanga** (Daily communication) - The text states Italian is used for daily communication.
* **C: Umtsetfo** (Formal rules) - The text mentions Italian is used in formal procedures.
* **D: Kuchumana lokusemtsetfweni** (Formal communication) - While it's used *in* formal settings, it's specifically for religious ceremonies.



"
"Edolobheni lase-Vatican, indzaba si-Italian singasebentiswa sona?","The correct answer is **D: Kuchumana wonkhe malanga**.

The passage states: ""I-Vatican City isebentisa Sitaliyane emitsetfweni kanye netekuchumana letisemtsetfweni. SiTaliyane siphindze sibe lulwimi lolusetjentiswa onkhe malanga ngulabo labasebenta khona..."" (Vatican City uses Italian in official business and communication. Italian is also the language used every day by those who work there...). This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umtsetfo (Official business):** While Italian *is* used for official business, the passage says it's used for *all* daily communication too.
*   **B: Kuchumana lokusemtsetfweni (Official communication):**  Similar to A, it's not the full picture.
*   **C: Imicimbi yenkholo (Religious ceremonies):** Latin is primarily used for religious ceremonies, not Italian."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokuzuzisako ngekucuba umsindvo wabongcondvomshini labasezingeni lelisetulu?","The correct answer is **A: Umculo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Umculo utfebulwa kusetjentiswa bongcondvomshini labayinkimbinkimbi kwenta nekuhlanganisa imisindvo kanyekanye."" This directly translates to ""Music is produced using sophisticated machines to create and combine sounds."" 

Therefore, the passage explicitly states that sophisticated machines are used to *create music*. The other options (imifanekiso - images, titfombe - pictures, kwakha - to build) are not directly mentioned as benefits of using these machines in the text."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, miningi lemiti lekuyiphi indzawo lenemathoyilethi lashaywako?","The correct answer is **A: I-Mohenjo-daro**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that ""Emadolobha aseHarapa neMohenjo-daro anemitindlu tangasese lehambisa indle ngemanti cishe kuto tonkhe tindlu..."" (The cities of Harapa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets that carried water to almost every house...). This indicates a widespread presence of toilets in Mohenjo-daro.

While toilets are mentioned in other locations (Minoan Crete/Santorini, Egypt, Persia, China, and Rome), the passage emphasizes the extensive and organized toilet systems found in Mohenjo-daro and Harapa.



"
Kukutiphi tindzawo kuleti letilandzelako lapho kutholwe khona emasistimu endle atfutfukile?,"The correct answer is **A: I-Harappa**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Emadolobha aseHarapa neMohenjo-daro anemitindlu tangasese lehambisa indle ngemanti cishe kuto tonkhe tindlu..."" (The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets that carried water to almost every house...). 

While toilets were also found in other places mentioned (Minoan Crete/Santorini, Egypt, Persia, China, and Rome), the passage highlights Harappa and Mohenjo-daro as having *advanced systems* connected to nearly every house.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokubangela kutsi loshwibako ajike?,"The correct answer is **A: Lijika lelincane ngaphasi kwensingo yesketi**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ngenca yekutsi ngaphansi lolusingo lutjekile kancane, njengoba lolusingo lugucuka kusuka kulolunye luhlangotsi kuya kulololunye, lesiphetfo sawo lesitsintsa lelichwa naso siyagobeka. Loku kubangela kutsi lamasodvo ahambe.""  This translates to: ""Because the bottom of the skirt is slightly tilted, as the skirt swings from one side to the other, its delicate fabric also bends. This causes the seams to move.""

This tilting of the skirt's bottom edge is what causes the seams to move and therefore the dress to swing in the direction you lean. The other options are irrelevant to the explanation provided in the text.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokuchaza ngalokungiko imbobo yensimbi yesimanje yekushibilika esithwathweni?","The correct answer is **B: Kugobekile (Curved)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngenca yekutsi ngaphansi lolusingo lutjekile kancane, njengoba lolusingo lugucuka kusuka kulolunye luhlangotsi kuya kulololunye, lesiphetfo sawo lesitsintsa lelichwa naso siyagobeka."" (Because the underside of the spoon is slightly convex, as the spoon curves from one side to the other, its shallow bowl also curves.)

This directly describes the spoon as being curved.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lokukabili (Double):** While the spoon has two corners, this isn't what defines its functionality or the key characteristic described in relation to the food movement.
*   **C: Umgede (Flat):** The passage explicitly states it *isn't* flat (""ngaphansi lolusingo lutjekile kancane"" - the underside is slightly convex).
*   **D: Kutjekile (Convex):** While the underside *is* convex, the passage focuses on the *resulting* curve of the bowl itself. Saying ""curved"" more accurately describes the overall shape affecting the food.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, nguyiphi inchubo levumela ema-athomu kutsi asuse emandla langetulu kwemandla ekukhanya?","The correct answer is **C: I-Photon**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that atoms release excess energy gained from light by *emitting* a small packet of energy called a ""photon."" This emission of photons is how they return to their original energy level.  The passage directly links the removal of excess energy to the photon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Imisebe (Rays/Beams):** While the passage discusses light and its interaction with atoms, it's the *photon* – a particle *of* light – that's the key to releasing the excess energy, not the rays themselves.
*   **B: Kukhishwa kwema-photon lavuselewe (Emission of excited photons):** The passage doesn't mention *excited* photons being emitted, only photons in general. It's the act of emitting *a* photon that matters.
*   **D: Kukhishwa kwemisebe levuselelwe (Emission of excited rays/beams):** Similar to option B, this focuses on 'excited rays' which isn’t the central concept explained in the text.



"
Yini leyenta i-atom ikhiphe i-photon?,"The correct answer is **A: Kukhulula emandla lamaningi (Releasing excess energy)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kuze abuyele akhanye ngelizinga lebekakhanya ngalo ngaphambili kufanele alahle emandla lengetiwe lawatfole kulokukhanya.""  This directly translates to ""In order to return to shining at the level it shone at before, it must release the excess energy it gained from the light.""  This excess energy is released *as* a photon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kuvuselela lokubangwa kukhanya lokukhulu (Stimulating the formation of larger light):** The passage doesn’t mention anything about “forming” light, only *releasing* it.
* **C: Emazinga emandla langakazinzi (Unstable energy levels):** While energy levels are involved, the passage focuses on *releasing* excess energy, not just instability.
* **D: Kusabela lokungasikuhle emisebeni (Bad reactions in the beams):** This is not mentioned in the text.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini letawugcina ibanga kutsi sibani siyekele kusebenta?","The correct answer is **A: Sibani asikacinywa ngendlela lekahle**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the switch must be turned off *or* the fuse removed **before** changing the lightbulb. This is to prevent electric shock. The passage warns of being shocked if you touch metal parts while the socket is still live.  Therefore, the danger comes from not properly disabling the power.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kuba nesisekelo sensimbi yesibani kuphela kancane kusokhethi** - While a loose connection could cause problems, the passage doesn't focus on that as the *immediate* danger.
* **C: Mucu lophakatsi kwesibani uyasha** - A broken filament would mean the bulb is simply burned out, not a safety hazard during replacement.
* **D: Kugeleta kwagezi kuya kusokhethi kuyancipha** -  The passage doesn't mention anything about grease.



"
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokungaba yingoti kukutsintsa uma ushintja sibani?,"The correct answer is **B: Inkinobho yekukhanya (The light switch)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kwekucala, iswishi yalelilambu kufanele icishwe..."" which translates to ""First, the light switch must be turned off..."". 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mucu (Finger):** Touching the bulb itself is dangerous and the text warns against touching metal parts.
*   **C: Sisekelo sesibani (Base of the lamp):** The base isn't what you'd touch to stop the flow of electricity.
*   **D: Ikhebuli (Cable):** While unplugging the lamp is also mentioned as a safety measure, the first and primary step is to turn off the switch.



"
"Ngekusho kwesicephu, kwentekani uma i-nucleus ihlukana?","The correct answer is **B: Emandla ayakhululwa** (Energy is released).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...futsi bese ikhipha emanye alawo mandla."" which translates to ""...and then releases some of that energy."" This directly links the splitting of the nucleus to the release of energy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ema-Proton ayatfolakala** (Protons are found) - While protons *are* part of the nucleus, the passage doesn't say they're *found* when it splits, just that fission involves nuclei with many protons.
*   **C: Ema-Atom awazinzi** (Atoms become unstable) - The passage states some atoms *are* prone to splitting because their nuclei aren't stable, but it doesn't say instability *results* from the split. It's a pre-existing condition.
*   **D: Ema-Neutron alahlekile** (Neutrons are lost) - While neutrons are involved in fission, the passage doesn't specifically say they are lost during the process.



"
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokukhombisa libanga lelidze kushayela emuva emhlabeni,"The correct answer is **B: Emasethelayithi**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Lesethelayithi lesemkhatsini itfola lucingo bese ilubuyisela emvu emhlabeni ngekushesha."" (This satellite in space receives the signal and returns it to the earth immediately.)  This directly connects satellites to relaying signals back to Earth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tibonakudze (Binoculars):** While used by scientists to *see* things, they don't relay the signal back to Earth.
*   **C: Tibani (Bands):** This isn't mentioned in the context of signal transmission.
*   **D: Emarokhethi (Rockets):** Rockets are used to *launch* the satellite, but they don't handle the signal once the satellite is in space.



"
Ngikuphi kuleti letisebentiselwa kubeka sibonakudze emkhatsini?,"The correct answer is **B: Emarokhethi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bososayensi basebentisa sibonakudze... Kudzingeka irokhethi lengemafidi langetulu kwalangu-100 kuphakama kuze ufake isethelayithi noma sibonakudze.""  This directly indicates that rockets are used to place the telescope (sibonakudze) into space.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Imishayo lekhanyako (Light rays)** - Light rays are *affected* by the telescope, but not the location where it's placed.
*   **C: Umkhatsi wemhlaba (Earth's space)** - This is where it ends up, but not *how* it gets there.
*   **D: Emasethelayithi langetulu kwemamitha langu-100 kuphakama (Satellites over 100 meters high)** - This describes the *height* where it's placed, not the method of placement.



"
Lokufanele kucaphelwe ngemcimbi lojikeletako kute kulandzelwe kuhamba kwesikhatsi?,"The correct answer is **A: Budze besikhatsi** (The nature of time).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sikhatsi futsi siyindlela lesicatsanisa ngayo **budze betehlakalo**."" (Time is also the way we understand the **nature of events**).  The whole text revolves around trying to grasp what time *is*, its fundamental qualities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ludumo (Fame):**  Fame isn't related to understanding the cyclical nature of time.
* **C: Tsintsa (Silence):** While the passage mentions ""tsintsa konkhe lesikwentako"" (silence all that is old), it's used metaphorically and doesn't represent what needs to be observed in cyclical events.
* **D: Lukhuni (Hardship):** Hardship isn't the key to understanding time's cyclical flow.



"
"Ngekusho kwesicephu, ngusiphi sici sesigameko lesisebentiswa sikhatsi kucatsanisa?","The correct answer is **A: Budze**.

The text explicitly states: ""Sikhatsi futsi siyindlela lesicatsanisa ngayo **budze** betehlakalo."" This translates to ""Time is also the way we organize the **order** of events."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ludumo (Fame/Reputation)** - This isn't mentioned in the text in relation to how time organizes events.
* **C: Sipiliyoni (Experience)** - While time *allows* for experience, it doesn't *organize* events by experience itself.
* **D: Tsintsa (Thought/Mind)** -  The text mentions thinking *about* time, but not that time organizes events by thought.



"
"Ngekusho kwesicephu, ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokubukwa njengalokutayelekile njengendlalifa yesihlalo sebukhosi?","The correct answer is **D: Kuya enyuvesi ngaphambi kwekujoyina emasotja**.

Here's why:

The passage states that it was *traditional* for heirs to the throne to go into the military. However, Charles *first* went to university (Trinity College, Cambridge) and *then* joined the military. This broke with tradition, making going to university *before* the military the new, more accepted path for an heir.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kutfola i-2:2 libanga (Getting a 2:2 degree):** While mentioned, the degree itself isn't presented as a tradition.
*   **B: Kuyekela inyuvesi kute ujoyine emasotja (Leaving university to join the military):** The passage indicates this was the *old* tradition, not the current one.
*   **C: Kufundza Umlandvo (Studying History):**  He studied History *after* Anthropology and Archaeology, and it wasn't presented as a typical requirement for an heir.



"
"Ngalokusekelwe elwatini loluniketwe indzimeni, Charles waba wekucala kwentani?","The correct answer is **C: Kutfola ticu (Getting a degree)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Charles bekalilungu lekucala Lomndeni Wasebukhosini WaseBritish lowaklomeliswa ngesicu se-degree."" This translates to ""Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to be awarded a degree.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kujiyina emasotja ngaphambi kwekucedza sikolo (Joining the army before finishing school)** - The passage mentions he ""condzile emasotjeni"" (joined the army) *after* finishing school, not before.
* **B: Kufundza umvubukulo (Studying history)** - He *did* study history, but wasn't the first to do so. The passage focuses on him being the first to get a degree.
* **D: Kufundza ekholeji i-Trinity (Studying at Trinity College)** - He studied there, but being a student isn't what made him first in the Royal Family.



"
Ivela kuliphi live imikhumbi i-Trygvasson?,"The correct answer is **D: E-Norway**.

The text specifically states: ""Olaf Trygvasson, indvodza yaseNorway..."" which translates to ""Olaf Trygvasson, a man from Norway..."" Therefore, his ships originate from Norway."
Ngusiphi sikhatsi emlandvweni lapho Ijalimani yaba nelithonya lemasiko lelinemandla e-Estonia?,"The correct answer is **B: Eminyakeni lengu-400 lendlulile**.

Here's why:

The passage states the influence was around the 15th century (""cishe ngelikhulu lesi-15""). Counting back from today (2024), the 15th century was roughly 600 years ago. However, the passage also mentions the influence *continues* to be seen today, with many borrowed words. This suggests a long-lasting influence, and 400 years (around the 16th century onwards) is a more reasonable timeframe for a sustained cultural impact that is still felt.

While 600 years is technically closer, the context of ongoing influence makes 400 years the more logical choice.



"
Lulwimi lase-Estonia lacalwa yini?,"The correct answer is **B: I-alfabethi yaseJalimani**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the letter ""Õ/õ"" was *added* to the Estonian language, and this came about due to German influence. While the passage mentions attempts to bring God closer to the native people and uses of German words, the direct change to the language itself was through the introduction of a letter from the German alphabet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umlingisi Õ/õ** - This is the *result* of the influence, not the influence itself.
*   **C: Tindlela taseJalimane** - While German customs were a factor, the question asks *how* the language was influenced.
*   **D: Nkulunkulu** - This is the motivation behind some of the actions, not the linguistic change itself.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, linani lebantfu bemdzabu labakhuluma si-Hindi lishintjashintja ngekuya ngayiphi intfo?","The correct answer is **A: Uma lulwinisgodzi lolufana kakhulu nesi-Hindi lubaliwe** (If a closely related language to Hindi is counted).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Linani lalabakhuluma lulwimi lwalendzawo luyehlukana kushiyane ngekutsi labahlobene kakhulu bayabalwa yini noma cha."" This translates to: ""The number of native speakers varies depending on whether closely related languages are counted.""

This directly indicates that the number changes based on whether languages very similar to Hindi are included in the count.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Uma bantfu labakhuluma si-Urdu babaliwe** (If Urdu speakers are counted) - While Hindi and Urdu are similar, the text specifically mentions the variation in *native* Hindi speakers, not just adding Urdu speakers.
*   **C: Uma bantfu labakhona kuvisisa lolulwimi babaliwe** (If people who understand the language are counted) - The text focuses on *speakers*, not just understanding.
*   **D: Uma bantfu labakhona kufundza lolulwimi babaliwe** (If people who learn the language are counted) -  The text focuses on *native* speakers, not those learning it.

Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokusitatimende lesiliciniso mayelana netilwimi i-Hindi kanye ne-Urdu?,"The correct answer is **B: Tiyahluka ngembhalo** (They differ in writing).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""SiHindi nesiUrdu kusebentisa emagama lafanako kepha kuhlukile ngekubhala phansi"" which translates to ""Hindi and Urdu use similar words but differ in writing.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngalokuvamile kuba nekuncamulwa emkhatsini kwetikhulumi talamalwimi womabili** (There is usually confusion between speakers of both languages) - The text states they often understand each other.
*   **C: Tiyafana kuko kokubili emagama nembhalo** (They are alike in both words and writing) - The text states they are *not* alike in writing.
*   **D: Tihluke ngemagama** (They differ in words) - The text states they use *similar* words.



"
Ngikuphi lokulandzelako lokungasilo liciniso lekungilo mayelana nema-alfabethi eHangeul?,"The correct answer is **B: Ligama langemphela lema-alfabethi bukungu Hunan Jeongeum**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Ubite ngalokusemtsetfweni i-alfabhethi yeHangeul **Hunmin Jeongeum**, lesho kutsi """"umsindvo lokunguwo weticondziso tebantfu"""".""  The correct spelling is Hunmin *Jeongeum*, not Hunan Jeongeum.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

*   **A: Yasungulwa ekucaleni kwekubusa kweNkosi Sejong:** The passage says it was created around 1444, which falls within Sejong's reign (1418-1450).
*   **C: Yasungulwa inkosi yesine ya-Joseon Dynasty:** The passage explicitly states Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty.
*   **D: Yasungulwa ngamabomu:** The passage implies it was deliberately created (by King Sejong) to improve literacy.



"
I-alfabethi Hunmin Jeongeum igcine ishintjwe yaba yini?,"The correct answer is **B: I-Hangeul**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ubite ngalokusemtsetfweni i-alfabhethi yeHangeul Hunmin Jeongeum..."" which translates to ""Originally the alphabet was called Hangeul Hunmin Jeongeum..."". This directly indicates that Hunmin Jeongeum is the original name of what is now known as Hangeul. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I-Sejong** - Sejong was the king who *created* the alphabet, not what it was renamed to.
* **C: I-Joseon** - Joseon was the dynasty during which it was created, not the name of the alphabet.
* **D: I-Jeongeum** - Jeongeum is part of the original name, but not the current, simplified name.



"
Ngekusho kwalendzima ngutiphi tilwimi letitfonye si-Sanskrit,"The correct answer is **A: Tilwimi tesi-Latin**.

The passage explicitly states: ""SiSanskrit lulwimi lwemdzabu futsi lufananiswa nelulwimi lwesi-Latin lolukhulunywa eYurophu."" (Sanskrit is an indigenous language and is compared to the Latin language spoken in Europe.)

Therefore, the passage identifies Latin as the language most closely related to Sanskrit.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kusebentiswa kwe-Sanskrit kwancipha ngenca yani?","The correct answer is **D: Kubusa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Emvakwekuhlanganiswa kwe-Upanishads, iSanskrit yanyamalala nje ngenca yalabaphetse."" This translates to: ""After the compilation of the Upanishads, Sanskrit disappeared simply because of the rulers.""

Therefore, the decline in the use of Sanskrit is attributed to those in power (rulers).



"
Ngekusho kwendzima ngikuphi kwesitatimende lekungiso mayelana nemandla ladvonsela ku-lo?,"The correct answer is **A: Emandla ladvonsela phasi angadvonsa kancane kuwe kunemandla a-lo ladvonsela phasi** (Gravity pulls on you less on lo than it does on Earth).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Emandla ladvonsela phansi, enta sisindvo sibe sikhulu."" (Gravity makes your weight greater.) and then gives the example of a person weighing 200lbs on Earth weighing only 36lbs on lo.
* **This demonstrates:** Gravity on lo is *weaker* than gravity on Earth.  Therefore, it pulls on you *less*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage doesn't say lo's gravity pulls *more* - it says you weigh less.
* **C:**  While you *feel* lighter, it's because of weaker gravity, not because you're inherently stronger.
* **D:** This is the opposite of what the passage states. Earth's gravity pulls on you *more*.



"
Ngekusho kwendzima ngutiphi taletilandzelako titatimende letichaza ngalokungiko luhla lweNyanga lwangaphandle?,"The correct answer is **A: Luhlangotsi lolusedvute lune luhla lolungaphandle lolukhulu.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lencenye yenyeti lebitwa ngekutsi yi-crust ingemakhilomitha langu 70 bududla ngasehlangotsini loludvute bese iba ngemakhilomitha langu 100 bududla ngasehlangotsini lolukhashane."" This directly translates to the far side (usedvute) having a thicker crust (and therefore a higher elevation) than the near side (lukhashane).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Loluhla lwangaphandle luncane kunetindzawo letisetulu** - The passage states the opposite - the crust is *thicker* on the far side.
* **C: Kungaba na-maria lomncane ehlangotsini lolukhashane** - The passage doesn't specifically relate maria (lava plains) to either side of the moon, only mentions maria being more likely due to the thinner crust.
* **D: Kungaba na-maria lomncane ngaphasi kwetindzawo letisetulu** - Similar to C, the passage doesn't directly connect maria to high or low areas, only the crust thickness.



"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, kukuphi lapho lucwecwe lweNyanga lulukhulu khona?","The correct answer is **A: Eluhlangotsini loludvutane (On the near side)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...i-crust ingemakhilomitha langu 70 bududla ngasehlangotsini loludvute bese iba ngemakhilomitha langu 100 bududla ngasehlangotsini lolukhashane."" This directly translates to ""...the crust is 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.""  Therefore, the crust (and thus the ""lucwecwe"" - crust) is thicker, and therefore larger, on the near side.



"
"Ngekusekelwa indzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokukholelwa bantfu labatsite?","The correct answer is **C: Imphilo ikhona kulamanye maulanethi** (Life exists on other planets).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...labanye bayatibuta kutsi kunani lengaphandle labanye bakholwa kutsi kukhona tidalwa noma kukhona lokuphilako kuleminye imikhatsi."" This translates to ""...some wonder what is out there, and some believe there are creatures or living things on other planets.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bantfu bahambe baya kuletinye tinkhanyeti** (People will travel to other stars) - The passage mentions this *might* happen ""ngalinye lilanga"" (one day), but it's presented as a future possibility, not a current belief.  It also states it won't happen soon.
* **B: Bantfu abakhoni kubuka leminye imihlaba** (People cannot see other worlds) - The passage doesn't say people *can't* see other worlds, but rather that they *imagine* them through dreams.
* **D: Kunemamayela langaphasi kwetigidzigidzi emkhatsini kwetinkhanyeti** (There are distances of less than billions of miles between stars) - This is a factual statement about the vastness of space, used to illustrate the difficulty of travel, not a belief people hold.



"
Lokuba kuncane uma uchubeka uhamba usuka emkhatsini kwelilanga?,"The correct answer is **C: Igesi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lomoya uba muncane nawuchubekela khashane nemkhatsi welilanga."" which translates to ""This gas becomes thinner as you move away from the sun's surface.""  

Therefore, the thing that becomes smaller/thinner as you move away from the sun is gas (Igesi).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I-Plasma:** While the sun *contains* plasma, the passage doesn't say plasma gets thinner.
*   **B: Umlilo:** Fire is a result of the processes within the sun, not something that diminishes as you move away.
*   **D: Luhlu lwangaphandle:**  This refers to the photosphere (outer layer), not something that gets smaller in density.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, nguyiphi incenye yelilanga lebonakalako emhlabeni?","The correct answer is **C: I-phothosphere**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Incenye lengephandle lesiyibonako nasibuka Lilanga ibitwa ngekutsi yi-photosphere, lokusho kutsi """"libhola lekukhanya""""."" This directly translates to ""The outer part we see when we look at the Sun is called the photosphere, which means """"sphere of light"""".""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Luhlu langaphandle** - While the photosphere *is* an outer layer, the passage specifically names it as the visible one.
*   **B: Le-Plasma** - Plasma is *within* the sun, not what we directly see.
*   **D: Umkhatsi** -  ""Umkhatsi"" translates to core, which is the innermost part of the sun.



"
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokuphawuliwe lokwasita ekucinisekiseni lokusemcondvweni wa-Copernicus?,"The correct answer is **A: Tigaba ta-Venus**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Galileo Galilei observing Venus' phases ""supported Copernicus's claim that the planets revolve around the Sun.""  The phases of Venus (like the moon) could only be explained if Venus was orbiting the Sun.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kuhamba kwe-Venus:** While Horrocks observed Venus's movement, the passage connects Copernicus's theory specifically to the *phases* observed by Galileo.
*   **C: Kufana kweLilanga ne-Venus:** The passage doesn't highlight similarities between the sun and Venus, but rather Venus’s behavior being similar to the moon.
*   **D: Kufana kweLilanga neNyeti:** While the passage explains how the moon appears illuminated, it emphasizes the phases of Venus as the confirming evidence for Copernicus’s idea.



"
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokwabonwa ngu-Galileo Galilei ngo-1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Tigaba ta-Venus**.

The text explicitly states: ""cishe ngemuva kweminyaka letinkhulungwane letintsatfu, nga-1610, umTaliyane losati setinkhanyeti longuGalileo Galilei wasebentisa sibonakudze kuze abone kutsi i-Venus inetigaba, njengoba nje nenyeti inato."" (roughly translated: ""around three thousand years ago, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe that Venus has phases, just like the moon"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Luhlangotsi lweNyeti lolubuke Lilanga (The illuminated part of the Moon facing the Sun)** - While the text mentions how the moon is illuminated, it doesn't say Galileo *observed* this specifically in 1610.
*   **C: Emapulanethi atungeleta lilanga (Planets orbiting the sun)** - This is a *conclusion* supported by Galileo’s observations, but not what he directly observed.
*   **D: Kuhamba kwe-Venus (The movement of Venus)** - Jeremiya Horrocks observed the movement of Venus, not Galileo.



"
"Ngekusho kwemugca, uwatsatsaphi emanti lomfula i-Amazon?","The correct answer is **A: Imifula lemincane**.

The text states: ""Utsatsa emanti etinkhulungwaneni temifula lemincane."" which translates to ""It draws water from thousands of small rivers."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: umifula lomudze kunawo wonkhe** - The text doesn't say it draws from *all* the largest rivers.
* **C: Lulwandle** - The text says 20% of the planet's river water *returns* to the ocean from the Amazon, not that it draws water *from* the ocean.
* **D: Umfula wesibili lomkhulu kunawo wonkhe** - This describes the Amazon, but doesn't state where its water comes from.



"
Ngikuphi kuncoma lokungakabaluleki emfuleni i-Amazon?,"The correct answer is **A: Umfula wesibili lomudze kunawo wonkhe** (The second largest river in the world).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Umfula i-Amazon ingumfula wesibili ngebukhulu nebudze emhlabeni..."" (The Amazon is the second largest river in the world in terms of length and volume...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umfula lomkhulu kunawo wonkhe** (The largest river in the world) - The passage specifically states it's the *second* largest.
* **C: Umfula lomkhulu lomudze wonkhe** (The largest river in volume) - While it carries a lot of water, it's not stated as the largest in volume overall, only that it returns 20% of the planet's freshwater to the ocean.
* **D: Umfula lobanti kunawo wonkhe** (The deepest river in the world) - The passage mentions its depth fluctuates greatly during the year, but doesn't claim it's the deepest overall.



"
Ngumuphi umugca wemsebenti locasha inombolo lencane yebantfu base-Venezuela?,"The correct answer is **A: Tekulima (Agriculture)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""one in five Venezuelans working are in agriculture."" This means 20% of the workforce is in agriculture. 

Let's compare that to the other options based on the text:

*   **Indzawo yekukhicita tintfo letitsite (The informal sector):** The passage says ""many of those who are employed work in the informal sector,"" suggesting a *large* percentage.
*   **I-Oyila (Oil):** The passage states ""only one percent of Venezuelans are employed in the oil sector."" This is a very small percentage.
*   **Umsebenti (Work/Employment):** This isn't a specific sector, but a general category.

Therefore, agriculture has the smallest percentage (one in five, or 20%) compared to the informal sector (many) and oil (only one percent)."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, nguyiphi kulemikhakha lelandzelako lecasha bantfu inombolo lekhulu yebantfu base-Venezuela?","The correct answer is **A: Umsebenti** (Work/Employment).

Here's why:

The passage states ""Maphesenti lalishumi nesiphohlongo ebantfu baseVenezuela labangasebenti"" which translates to ""Ten percent of the Venezuelan people are employed."" This means employment encompasses the largest sector of the workforce. While the passage details percentages in other sectors (informal work, helping, diverse fields, agriculture, oil), it explicitly states the *overall* largest portion is those who are employed.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kuhlangana kutivumela kutsi tenteni tinkhanyeti?","The correct answer is **C: Khipha kukhanya nekushisa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Tinkanyeti tiniketa kukhanya nekushisa ngenca yemandla laphuma ngesikhatsi ema-athomu e-hydrogene akheka (nobe ahlanganiswa) ndzawonye kwakha ema-elementi lasindzako.""  This translates to: ""Stars give off light and heat because of the energy released when hydrogen atoms combine to form heavier elements.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yakha takhi letisindzako** (Create heavier elements) - While stars *do* create heavier elements, the passage states this is the *result* of the process that creates light and heat, not the reason they shine.
*   **B: Yakha kuhlangana lokubuyisako** (Create a recursive connection) - This doesn't relate to the information in the passage.
*   **D: Idala i-hydrogen atoms** (Create hydrogen atoms) - The passage states stars *use* hydrogen atoms, they don't create them in this process.



"
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokungentiwa kuhlangana lokubuyisako lokulusito?,"The correct answer is **A: I-Hydrogen**.

Here's why:

The passage states that energy is released when hydrogen atoms *fuse* together to create heavier elements. The question asks what is being fused. Therefore, the answer is hydrogen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tinkhanyeti (Stars):** Stars *use* hydrogen fusion, but they aren't what's being fused.
*   **C: I-Atom (Atom):** While hydrogen *is* an atom, the passage specifically mentions *hydrogen atoms* fusing.
*   **D: Emandla (Energy):** Energy is *released* by the fusion, it isn't what is fusing.



"
Yini ikhemikhali leyentiwe ngemanti?,"The correct answer is **D: Ema-hydrogen atom lamabili kanye nemoya lohlobile lowodvwa i-atom**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Emanti akhiwa tincenye letimbili tema-athomu e-hydrogen kanye ne-athomu yinye yemoya lesiwuphefumulako.""  This translates to ""Water is made up of two parts hydrogen atoms and one part of the oxygen atom we breathe.""

Therefore, water is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
"
Uma emanti ashintja simo yini lokusale kufana?,"The correct answer is **A: Sakhiwo se-molecular** (Molecular structure).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Ngisho noma simo semtimba singase sishintje, kodvwa simo semakhemikhali sihlala sinjalo."" (Even if the state of matter changes, the chemical structure remains the same.)  The molecular structure *is* the chemical structure.
*   **B: Kuminyana** (Density) changes when matter changes state.
*   **C: Simo semtimba** (State of matter) is precisely what *changes* (solid, liquid, gas).
*   **D: I-nitrogen lemanti** (Nitrogen in water) is irrelevant – water is made of hydrogen and oxygen, not nitrogen.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lobekungasiyo inkinga yelive lapho itama kujabulisa umtsetfo lotsite?","The correct answer is **A: Kunganyelwa lokukhulu lokuvela kutiphatsimandla tembuso**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the government under the Articles of Confederation was weak because it *relied on the powers of the states*, and those states *didn't want to cooperate* with the central government.  This meant the central government couldn't effectively enforce laws or collect taxes due to the states' resistance. This lack of power *from* the states is the core problem described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kungabi nemandla phakatsi kwencubekelaphambili** - The passage doesn't focus on issues with internal division within the central government. The problem is external – the states undermining it.
*   **C: Tichibiyelo letidzinga kugunyatwa ngelivi linye** - While the requirement for unanimous consent for amendments is mentioned, it's presented as a *result* of the weakness, not the primary problem.
*   **D: Sikhulu selive lonkhe lesingekho** - The passage mentions the absence of an executive and judicial branch, but the fundamental issue is that even with those branches, Congress lacked the *power* to enforce its decisions because of the states.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngusiphi sitatimende lesiveta ngalokungiko simo sahulumende lomkhulu phakatsi kweMphi Yetingucuko?","The correct answer is **A: Umtsetfo wetintsela uphocelelwe ngukhongolose kanye netiphatsimandla telive**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ICongress ayisenamandla ekucoca intela, njengaloku bekangekho umphatsi welive nome bahluleli, yayincike etiphatsimandleni tembuso..."" (Congress had no power to collect taxes, there was no executive or judges, and it depended on the power of the states...). This directly supports the idea that tax collection was controlled by the states and local authorities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tichibiyelo tendzatjana betincike egunyeni lakhongolose (State disputes were dependent on the authority of the congress):** The passage states the opposite - states *didn't* want to cooperate with the central government, hindering its ability to resolve disputes.
* **C: Bameli bembuso abakabi khona (State representatives were not present):** While the passage mentions representatives weren't present *often* enough to make changes, it doesn't say they were generally absent.
* **D: Hulumende lomkhulu bekanetincenye letibili letiyinhloko (The central government had two main parts):** The passage highlights the *weakness* of the central government, not its structure. It mentions the lack of an executive and judiciary, indicating a lack of defined ""parts"".



"
Abhalwe njani emagama langemuva kweSimemetelo senkhululeko?,"The correct answer is **C: Kubuke phasi**.

The passage states: ""Lombhalo bowuvela ekugcineni kwaleliphepha lobewubhalwe kulo, ubhalwe ubheke phansi."" which translates to ""This writing appeared at the end of the paper it was written on, written facing downwards.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngefonti lekhulu** - The passage mentions the *size* of the document but not the font used.
*   **B: Ngekhodi** - The passage states it's not a treasure map, implying it’s not a coded message.
*   **D: Ngefonti lencane** - The passage doesn’t mention the size of the font.



"
I-Singapore idume ngakuphi kulokulandzelako?,"The correct answer is **A: Luhlata lwasemadolobheni (Urban greenery)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the Singapore Botanic Gardens played a role in changing the perception of orchids, and that a specific orchid (Vanda Miss Joaquim) became the national flower of Singapore. This highlights Singapore's focus on and reputation for its beautiful urban greenery.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kuhamba ngetinyawo (Hiking):** The text doesn't mention hiking.
*   **C: Luhambo letemidlalo (Sports tourism):** The text doesn't mention sports tourism.
*   **D: Buciko bekusebenta (Arts and crafts):** The text focuses on botany and national symbols, not arts and crafts.



"
Yini iVanda Miss Joaquim?,"The correct answer is **B: Imbali**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Nga-1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, loyiorchid hybrid, wakhetfwa waba yimbali yesive yavelonkhe."" This directly translates to ""In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, this orchid hybrid, was chosen as the national flower."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sichingi** - The text mentions it's a hybrid *of* an orchid, but Vanda Miss Joaquim itself *is* the flower.
*   **C: Ingadze yetitjalo** - While the Singapore Botanic Gardens is a garden, Vanda Miss Joaquim is the flower itself, not the garden.
*   **D: Litje lesikhumbuto lavelonkhe** - While it *is* a national symbol, the text explicitly identifies it as a flower.



"
Ngekusho kwalendzima ngusiphi sici semaphirimidi ase-Giza lebekungentaki kutsi ingawumangati bukhosi lobusha baseGibhite?,"The correct answer is **C: Bukhulu bato** (Their size).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""emaphiramidi ase Giza awazange endlulelwe sikhatsi ngebukhulu nebuchwephesha lobasetjentiswa nakakhiwa."" This translates to ""the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size or the skill used to build them.""

The passage then says the New Kingdom Egyptians were amazed by the pyramids. This amazement stemmed from the pyramids’ enduring quality and *size* – they couldn’t replicate that scale.  The other options (year they were built, resources used, how they were built) are not directly highlighted as the source of the New Kingdom Egyptians' wonder.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, tisuka tibuya kuphi tilwane letidla tjani uma tilandzela imvula?","The correct answer is **B: Tintsaba tasenyakatho**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...tisuka etintsabeni letingasenyakatfo kuze titfole imvula."" This directly translates to ""...they come from the northern mountains to find rain."" 

Therefore, the animals originate from the northern mountains when following the rain."
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, nguyiphi indzawo tilwane letidla tjani letisuka kuyo kusukela ngesikhatsi sa-April?","The correct answer is **A: Sifundza se-Serengeti**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...futsi uphindze abuye enyakatfo angena ngasenshonalanga, endlula emfuleni i-Mara, **ngemuva kwetimvula tanga-April**.""  This means after the April rains, the animals return *to* the Serengeti.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ematsafa aseningizimu:** The text says they *travel to* the south, not that they come *from* the south after April.
* **C: Umfula i-Mara:** The river is a point they cross, not where they originate from after April.
* **D: i-Maasai Mara Nation Reserve:** While they pass through here, they are returning *to* the Serengeti after April.



"
Kusebenta kwaSealion kwaba kuhlasela kwaliphi live?,"The correct answer is **B: I-Britain**.

The text explicitly states: ""Njengoba libutfo laseFrance laseliphelile, emaJalimane acala kulungela kungena esichingini saseBrithani."" (As the French army collapsed, the Germans began preparing to invade Britain.) and that ""Operation Sealion"" was the code name for the attack *on* Britain.
"
Akubite ngani emaJalimani kuhlasela eBritain?,"The correct answer is **B: Operation Sealion**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ikhodi yaseJalimane yetsa lokuhlasela ngekutsi """"yi-Operation Sealion""""."" (The German code named the attack ""Operation Sealion"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I-Dunkirk** - Dunkirk was an *evacuation* of British and allied troops, not the name of the planned German invasion.
*   **C: I-Kriegsmarine** - This is the name of the German Navy.
*   **D: I-Royal Navy** - This is the British Navy, and it was defending against the invasion, not the name of it.



"
Yini lengakashiwo njengesinyatselo lesidzingekako ehlelweni le-Italy lekuthumba emave ase-Afrika?,"The correct answer is **D: Kubhidlita tisekelo taseBritain**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngaphandle kwekwenta loko, timphi taseTaliyane bekungakafaneli tente lokunye.""  ""Loko"" refers to breaking away from British support and ships in Egypt (""behlukane netisekelo taseBrithani nemikhumbi eGibhithe""). This means eliminating British support was *essential* for Italy's plan to invade Africa to succeed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kususa imikhumbi eGibhithe:** While related, the passage emphasizes removing *support* (bases/infrastructure) from Britain, not just ships.
*   **B: Kwakha imikhumbi lengetiwe:** The passage mentions they were still building warships, but it doesn't present this as a prerequisite for invading Africa.
*   **C: Kwakha i-pad yekucalisa yeliciniso:** This option doesn't appear in the passage at all.



"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, yini lebeyibukwa njenjongo yekucala ye-Italy ngalemphi?","The correct answer is **A: Kutfumba emave ase-Afrika** (Conquering territories in Africa).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ITaliyane umgomo wayo loyinhloko bekukungena emaveni ase-Afrika."" This directly translates to ""Italy's main goal was to enter territories in Africa."" 

The other options are related to *how* Italy planned to achieve that goal (building a strong military, dealing with British support), but aren't the goal *itself*.



"
Ngubani lowakhe budlelwane bebungani nebahlaseli?,"The correct answer is **B: I-Vichy French**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the ""Vichy French"" were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and *worked with* the invaders rather than fighting them. This indicates a friendly relationship with the enemy (the invaders/attackers).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kwakha libutfo lelinamandla kanye nemasotja aselwandle** - This is a general statement and doesn't represent a specific group with a friendly relationship with the attackers.
*   **C: Bantfu baseMelika** - The Americans *attacked* France, so they weren't friendly with the attackers.
*   **D: Ma-French Lakhululekile** - The Free French fought *against* the Germans, so they were not friendly with the attackers.



"
Bobani labangani bebabandzanyekile ku-Operation Dragoon?,"The correct answer is **A: Bantfu base-Melika kanye nema-French Lakhululekile** (Americans and Free French).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Ngemaviki lamabili nje kuphela emaMelika  nemabutfo ase France lebesekakhululiwe, akhulula incenye leseNingizimu ye France..."" which translates to ""For just two weeks, the Americans and the already liberated French forces liberated part of Southern France..."". 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The text clearly states the Vichy French *collaborated* with the Germans, they weren't allies in Operation Dragoon.
*   **C:**  The Allies (including Americans and Free French) were fighting *against* the Germans.
*   **D:** Americans were fighting *against* the Germans.

Umnyango wabuphi bucwepheshe lodale kutsi imikhumbingwenya ihambe ngaphansi kwemanti?,"The correct answer is **A: Tikebhe te-U**. 

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Imikhumbi yaseJalimane lehamba ngaphansi kwemanti yayibitwa ngekutsi yi-U-Boats."" (German submarines were called U-Boats). This directly links U-Boats (submarines) to the technology of underwater travel. The passage doesn't mention anything about shooting (Luhlalekudubula), navigation (Kuzulazula), or radar (Irada) being the primary development that *enabled* submarines to travel underwater.



"
"Ekusebentisweni kwawo kwekucala, imikhumbingwenya beyinebubanti lobukalekile kakhulu kuyiphi indzawo?","The correct answer is **B: Lohambako**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ekucaleni kwemphi ngalokuvamile beyihamba ngetulu kwelwandle, kodvwa nakucalwa kwakhiwa intfo letsite lebona indlela, sigaba nelitubane umkhumbi lohamba ngalo futsi ishaya khona, imikhumbi lehamba ngephansi yaphoceleleka kutsi ihambe ngephansi kuze ingabonwa.""

This translates to: ""At the beginning of the war, they usually traveled on the surface of the water, but when it was started something small was built to see the way, a stage and a tube the ship travels through and hits it, the ships traveling underwater succeeded in traveling underwater until they were unseen.""

This clearly indicates the initial weakness was in their **speed/movement (Lohambako)** – they were slow and couldn’t maneuver well underwater.  The text goes on to describe how they overcame this to effectively travel *underwater*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Zulazula (Searching):** The text mentions the Germans were good at *finding* their U-boats, not that the submarines had trouble searching.
*   **C: Dubula (Shooting):** The text mentions they couldn't shoot effectively while submerged initially, but that's not their primary initial weakness.
*   **D: Kusebenta (Working/Operating):**  The problem wasn't that they didn't work, but *how* they moved and operated underwater.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubani lophule sivumelwano? ","The correct answer is **D: EmaSoviet**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Soviet Union Red Army invaded Poland, *breaking* the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties. This clearly indicates they were the ones who violated the agreements.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: BasePoland:** The passage states Poland's defense was *damaged* and they were hoping to join forces with Rome, not that they broke agreements.
* **B: BaseRoma:** Rome (likely referring to Italy) was mentioned as a potential ally for Poland, not as a treaty breaker.
* **C: Base-Ukraine:** While Ukraine was invaded, the passage states the Soviet Union was the invading force.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakentiwa i-Red Army?,"The correct answer is **C: Kuhlelwa kabusha kwelibhuloho (Reorganizing the front)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Red Army ""langena futsi akha tingcinamba"" (entered and established fortifications) in Belarus and Ukraine.  This indicates they were *building* defenses, not reorganizing a pre-existing front.  The passage focuses on the *initial invasion* and breach of treaties.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kwakhiwa kwebuso be-Ukrainian (Building a Ukrainian facade):** The text doesn’t mention building a “facade”. It mentions establishing fortifications *in* Ukraine.
*   **B: Kuhlaselwa kwetifundza tasempumalanga (Attacking eastern territories):** The passage explicitly states they attacked eastern Poland (""kuhlasela tigodzi tasemphumalanga yePoland"").
*   **D: Kwephulwa kwesivumelwano (Breaking agreements):** The passage clearly states the invasion broke treaties (""phula umtsetfo iRiga Peace Treaty, neSoviet-Polish Non-Agression Pact"").



"
Kwentekani kunjiniyela lomkhuli weMasotja Elishumi ase-Italy?,"The correct answer is **C: Uthunjwe maBritish**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""EmaBritish abamba Njiniyela Losetulu Welishumi Wase-Italy, General Lastucci."" This directly translates to ""The British captured the Tenth Italian Army General, General Lastucci."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Utfunjwe eFort Capuzzo** - While Fort Capuzzo is mentioned, it's where the British *attacked*, not where Lastucci was captured.
* **B: Ubulewe eTobruk** - Marshal Balbo was killed at Tobruk, not General Lastucci.
* **D: Ubulawe mlilo webungani** - The text doesn't mention anything about friendly fire relating to Lastucci.



"
Wabulalelwaphi Italo Balbo?,"The correct answer is **D: E-Tobruk**.

The text states: ""Mhlaka-28 iNhlaba, Marshal Italo Balbo, loMbusi-Jikelele waseLibya futsi lobekufanele adle lifa laMussolini, wabulawa ngumlilo nakafika **eTobruk**."" (On June 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, the Governor-General of Libya and who was supposed to inherit Mussolini's legacy, was killed by fire upon arriving in **Tobruk**.)



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, nguwaphi emasu kulalandzelako layincenye lebalulekile yekuzindla kwe-Tibetan?","The correct answer is **B: Emavi laphindvwaphindvwako**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ikanye na-Kundalini Yoga emandla eKundalini (kukhanyiselwa) avuswa kuma-yoga, **indlela yekuphefumula, emavi laphindvwaphindvwako** kanye naloko lokubonwa ngemehlo.""  This directly links repeated mantras to the practice of Tibetan Buddhism and Kundalini Yoga.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kutijwayeta tivivinyo tekuphefemula** - While breathing exercises are mentioned, the passage focuses on mantras as a core practice.
*   **C: Kubona boNkulunkulu ngeliso lengcondvo** - Deity Yoga is mentioned, but the passage doesn't specify visualizing deities with the mind's eye as a core *technique* of meditation.
*   **D: Kuvisisa kuma kwe-yoga** - Understanding yoga is important context, but not a specific meditative practice.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, i-Chakras ivulwa njani ibeketelela “sikhungo” semitsi yase-Tibetan?","The correct answer is **A: Ngekusebentisa timo letihlukene te-yoga**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ikanye na-Kundalini Yoga emandla eKundalini (kukhanyiselwa) avuswa kuma-yoga, indlela yekuphefumula, emavi laphindvwaphindvwako kanye naloko lokubonwa ngemehlo.""  This directly translates to ""In connection with Kundalini Yoga, the energies of Kundalini (illuminated) are awakened through **yoga practices**, breathing techniques, repeated mantras and visualizations.""

While breathing techniques (D) and mantras (mentioned alongside yoga) are *part* of the process, the passage frames it as a broader use of *different types of yoga* to awaken the energies.  Options B and C are mentioned as components, but aren't the overarching method described for opening the chakras.



"
Ngubani lothule ingoma yesibili yemkhuleko phakatsi ehlelweni?,"The correct answer is **D: NguJai Shankar Choudhary**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Umhlabeleli lokungu Sanju Sharma nguye locale kuhlabela kulobusuku, walandzelwa ngu**Jai Shankar Choudhary**.""  This translates to ""The singer Sanju Sharma was the first to sing tonight, followed by **Jai Shankar Choudhary**.""  Therefore, Jai Shankar Choudhary sang the second song.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubani lowathula ingoma yemkhuleko ngalesikhatsi kunikelwa kudla?","The correct answer is **A: NguLakkha Singh**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kwase, Lakkha Singh wahola kuhlabela i-bhajans."" which translates to ""Then, Lakkha Singh led the singing of the bhajans.""  Bhajans are devotional songs, essentially prayers in song form, and he led them *during* the offering of the Chhappan Bhog.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: NguJai Shankar Choudhary:** He followed Sanju Sharma in singing, but didn't *lead* the singing during the offering.
*   **C: NguShri Shyam:** Shri Shyam is the deity *receiving* the offering, not the one singing.
*   **D: NguSanju sharma:** He was the first to sing, but Lakkha Singh led the bhajans *during* the offering.



"
Bekungumuphi umdlalo wesibili ekugcineni kwebusuku?,"The correct answer is **B: Umlilo wa-Anatolia**.

The passage states: ""Kucedzela, licembu lekudansa iFire of Anatolia lenta lombukiso i""""Troy""""."" This means the Fire of Anatolia performed the final act (""Troy""). Therefore, it was the second-to-last performance."
Ngubuphi buve ba-Alessandro Safina?,"The correct answer is **D: Wase-Italy**.

The text states: ""Umhlabeli we-tenor wase-Italy Alessandro Safina uhlabele..."" which translates to ""Italian tenor singer Alessandro Safina sang..."".
"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, ngusiphi kuletitatimende letilandzelako lesingasilo liciniso?","The correct answer is **A: Bekunemlilo e-Santa Clara**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states a fire captain, Scott Kouns, was present, and mentions hot weather.** However, it **doesn't explicitly say there was a fire *at* Santa Clara**. It just states it was a hot day in Santa Clara.
*   **B: Bantfu bebakhacamele ku-roller coaster** - The passage says people were stuck on a roller coaster, implying they were riding it.
*   **C: Bagibeli banikwe emanti** - The passage directly states, ""Bagibeli banikwe emanti...""
*   **D: Kutsatse lokungenani imizuzu lengu-60 kukhipha umuntfu wekucala lobekagibele lomshini wekutijabulisa** - The passage states it took ""at least an hour"" to get the first person off, which is 60 minutes.

Therefore, only option A is not directly stated as true in the passage."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubani lophawulile mayelana nekungakhululeki kwelizinga lekushisa?","The correct answer is **B: Umphatsi wemlilo** (Fire Captain).

The passage specifically states: ""Kapteni wemlilo Scott Kouns utsi, """"Bekulilanga lelishisako eSanta Clara emazinga ekushisa efika ku-90."""" (Fire Captain Scott Kouns says, ""It was a hot day in Santa Clara with temperatures reaching 90."") He is the one commenting on the uncomfortable heat.



"
Lapho bekuncamuka khona gezi ngenca yeTsunami?,"The correct answer is **A: E-Tonga**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kute umonakalo lomkhulu noma kulimala lokubikiwe eTonga, kepha **gesi wahamba kwesikhashana**, lokwavimbela tiphatsimandla taseTonga kutsi tive lesicwayiso setsunami."" This directly links the power outage to Tonga because of the tsunami.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: E-Niue:** The text mentions a tsunami was recorded near Niue, but not a power outage.
*   **C: Etikoleni eHawaii:** The text mentions harbors in Hawaii were closed, but not a power outage.
*   **D: E-Pago:** The text mentions a tsunami was recorded near Pago, but not a power outage.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, beyitsintseka kanjani iTonga ngekuncamuka kwagezi?","The correct answer is **D: Tiphatsimandla atikakhoni kutfola ticwayiso letifanele.**

Here's why:

The text states that the power went out in Tonga, *preventing* officials from receiving the tsunami warning issued by the PTWC. This means they were unable to get the appropriate warnings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bekunembiko wemonakalo** - The text says there was *no* major damage reported in Tonga.
* **B: Tiphatsimandla atimange titfole tindzaba mayelana neticwayiso letiphakamisiwe** - The power outage prevented them from receiving the news, so they couldn't have been monitoring it.
* **C: Kufundvwa kwelizinga lelulwandle kwatsintseka** - While sea level readings *showed* a tsunami was generated, that doesn't explain Tonga's difficulty. The issue was receiving the warning.



"
Emaphoyisa ayokhona nini kusebentisa tibhamu tawo tematubane kute bashaye sivinini sekushayela kwaJonny Reid?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngalesikhatsi ahamba ngesivinini lesingu-160 emakhilomitha ngelihora** (When he was traveling at a speed of 160 kilometers per hour).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Emaphoyisa aseNew Zealand bekanebumatima kusebentisa letibhamu tabo letinesivinini kubona kutsi Umnumzane Reid bekagijima kakhulu ngelizinga lelinganani...futsi lesikhatsi lesisodvwa lamaphoyisa lakhone kufundza ngaso sivinini seMnumzane Reid kwaba ngulapho ehlisa sivinini kuya ku-160km/h."" 

This directly translates to the police using their speed guns *when* he was going 160km/h – it was the point at which they could accurately measure his speed.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kungani kumatima emaphoyiseni ase-New Zealand kubamba sivinini saJonny Reid?","The correct answer is **B: Imoto beyiphasi kakhulu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Emaphoyisa aseNew Zealand bekanebumatima kusebentisa letibhamu tabo letinesivinini kubona kutsi Umnumzane Reid bekagijima kakhulu ngenca yekutsi Black Beauty unjani..."" 

This directly translates to: ""New Zealand police were having difficulty using their speed guns to determine how fast Mr. Reid was going *because of what Black Beauty was like*."" This implies the car's characteristics (likely its speed and performance) made it difficult to accurately measure its speed.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bekahamba ngesivinini lesingaphasi kwa-160 emakhilomitha ngelihora** - The text states he *reached* over 160km/h, not that he was always below it.
*   **C: Washayela etulu kwelibhuloho tikhatsi letisikhombisa kuphela** - While he did drive over the bridge several times, this doesn't explain the difficulty in measuring his speed.
*   **D: Lelibhuloho lase-Auckland Harbour lidzala kakhulu** - The age of the bridge is irrelevant to the police's ability to measure speed."
Kutamatama kwemhlaba bekugcile kuphi macondzana ne-Butte?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 emamayela eningizimu**.

The text states: ""cishe emakhilomitha langu-65 (emamayela langu-40) neningizimu yeButte."" which translates to ""approximately 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of Butte."""
Kwentekani ngesikhatsi seludlame e-Abu Ghraib?,"The correct answer is **A: Kuhlukumetwa kwetiboshwa** (Torture of prisoners).

The passage specifically states the trouble began ""after the discovery of prisoner abuse"" after the US military took control.  While the prison *was* eventually damaged (D), the initial problem and the source of the scandal was the abuse of prisoners.  

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kukhiya** (Locking up) - This is a normal function of a prison, not the problem described.
* **C: Emasotja ase-US atsatsa kulawula** (US soldiers took control) - This is the *context* of the problem, not the problem itself.
* **D: Lijele lashiswa** (Prison was burned) - The passage mentions it was damaged *during* the unrest, but the initial issue was the abuse.



"
Kungani lijele lase-Iraqi lizuze ludvumo? ,"The correct answer is **D: Kutfolakala kwekuhlukunyetwa kwetiboshwa** (The discovery of prisoner abuse).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the prison gained notoriety *after* the abuse of prisoners was revealed following the US military taking control.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lashiswa** (It was burned) - While the prison was damaged, that wasn't the reason for its notoriety.
* **B: Emabutho ase-US alawula** (US troops controlled it) - US control was a *precursor* to the notoriety, not the cause of it.
* **C: Kwaba netibhelu letiningi** (There were many problems) - This is too general; the *specific* abuse is what caused the outcry.



"
Luhlobo luni lemcimbi lobowutawuba eMaui War Memorial Stadium?,"The correct answer is **A: Umbukiso wemlingo** (Concert).

Here's why:

The text states ""Lelicembu lebahlabeleli likhansele umbukiso"" which translates to ""The band cancelled a concert."" This directly indicates the event was a concert.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umdlalo webhola letinyawo** (Soccer game) - The text doesn't mention any sport.
* **C: Kuhlangana** (Meeting) - A meeting wouldn't usually draw 9,000 people and be considered a ""show.""
* **D: I-fundraiser** (Fundraiser) -  While a concert *could* be a fundraiser, the text doesn't state that it was.  It focuses on the concert itself being cancelled.



"
Lowagcina anikete inchazelo mayelana nekuhociswa kwemcimbi?,"The correct answer is **B: Inkampani yekuphatsa (The managing company)**.

Here's why:

The text states that **HK Management Inc.**, the company managing the team, initially didn't provide a reason for the cancellation but *did* later offer an explanation. The other options are incorrect:

*   **Licembu (The team)** - They were the subject of the event, not the explainers.
*   **Umnikati weNkundla Yesikhumbuto Sempi (The stadium owner)** - The text doesn't mention their involvement in providing an explanation.
*   **Balandzeli (The fans)** - They were affected by the cancellation, but didn't provide the explanation.



"
Bobani labaningana betakhamuti tase-Bishkek labacabanga kutsi banelicala lekuphanga?,"The correct answer is **C: Babhikishi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Takhamuti letinyenti taseBishkek tibhikishe tisuka eningizimu tikhala ngekwephulwa kwemtsetfo."" This translates to: ""Many protesters in Bishkek protested from the south, blaming the government.""

Therefore, the protesters (babhikishi) are the ones who believe someone is responsible for the robbery/situation.



"
Ngubani losole babhikishi baseningizimu ngekutapa?,"The correct answer is **A: Takhamuti tase-Bishkek**.

The text states: ""Takhamuti letinyenti taseBishkek tibhikishe tisuka eningizimu tikhala ngekwephulwa kwemtsetfo.""  This directly translates to ""Many activists in Bishkek protested coming from the south complaining about the deterioration of the situation.""

Therefore, the protestors from the south *are* the Takhamuti of Bishkek.



"
Ngubani lowatfola indandatho lekhuphule intsengo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngemuva kwekuvela eThangini laShaka (After appearing on Shark Tank)**.

The text states: ""Kutsengiswa kukhuphukile ngemuva kwekuvela kwakhe nga-2013 eluhlelweni lolutsi Shark Tank lapho loluhlelo belukhuluma ngekwehla lobekubonake ekusekeleni."" (Sales increased after his appearance on Shark Tank in 2013 when the show talked about the decline seen in support.) This directly links the increased sales to the Shark Tank appearance.
"
Jamie Siminoff ukhetse nini kucala i-Ring?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngemuva kwekubona insimbi yakhe yasemnyango benyinganeli** (After noticing his own doorbell wasn't working well).

The passage states: ""Esikhatsini lesendlulile, CEO weRing's, Jamie Siminoff, watsi lenkapane yacala ngesikhatsi insimbi lesemnyango wakhe bewungavakali kahle umsindvo wayo esitolo sakhe nawusegaraji."" (Previously, Ring’s CEO Jamie Siminoff said the idea started when his doorbell wouldn’t reliably make a sound in his garage).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** Shark Tank appearance happened *after* the idea started, and it helped sales, but didn't *start* the company.
* **C:** The passage mentions a lawsuit with ADT, but not the reason for starting the company.
* **D:** The QVC appearance was later in the company’s history, also after it was already founded.



"
Sicephu ngasinye semusho wenkosatane saloko lokugcinela indzawo yekuhlala?,"The correct answer is **D: Tincwadzi (Books)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Each segment of the show would center around a single children’s book and expand upon that theme with many stories."" This directly connects each segment to a children's book.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umdlalo wamabonakudze (Television show):** While *Reading Rainbow* is a TV show, the question asks what each segment *centers around*.
*   **B: Umtapo welwati wendzawo (Local library):** The passage mentions kids going to a library *to look at* books, but the segments aren't *about* the library itself.
*   **C: Tingcikitsi (Stories):** While segments include multiple stories, they *expand upon the theme of a single book*."
Lokungenteka kube nemtselela ekusuleni Luchungechunge lekufudza umusho wenkosatana?,"The correct answer is **C: Umbono waJohn Grant**.

Here's why:

The passage states that John Grant and others *believe* the financial success and educational philosophy of shows like Reading Rainbow led to their longevity.  The question asks about a reason for the *continuation* of such series. Grant's statement directly connects the show's success to its positive impact on children's reading habits, suggesting a reason why funders and networks would continue to support it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Luchaso lolunganeli (Insufficient struggle):** The passage doesn't mention any struggles or challenges that led to the series continuing.
*   **B: Kushoda kwemiklomelo ye-Emmy (Lack of Emmy awards):** The passage actually states Reading Rainbow *won* over 20 Emmys, so a lack of them isn't a reason for continuation.
*   **D: Impumelelo yemphatsiswa Rogers endzaweni (Mr. Rogers' success in the area):** While Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood is mentioned, the passage doesn’t tie its success to the continuation of Reading Rainbow.



"
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokungasiyo ingcabano leyentiwe tikhulu te-Amsterdam kanye ne-Museum mayelana nesihlahla?,"The correct answer is **D: Ingoti imphilweni yemphakatsi**.

Here's why:

The passage states the tree was going to be felled (""siyasho kutsi lesihlahla satfola ifungus futsi siyingoti emphilweni yesive"") because it was deemed a danger to public safety.  The city and museum argued *against* felling it, emphasizing its importance. Therefore, the statement that the tree ""is a danger to the community"" is the opposing viewpoint they were fighting against.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nakanjani itawuwa** - This means ""It will definitely fall"" - this is what they were trying to *prevent*.
*   **B: Kufanele igcinwe** - This means ""It should be kept"" - this is the city and museum's position, not the opposing argument.
*   **C: Ingcoliswe lukhunta** - This means ""It was contaminated by fungus"" - this is a fact about the tree, not an argument about its fate.



"
Ngekwemhloli lomkhulu wekuhlolwa kwe-RSPCA kufanele kube kutayelekile kulokulandzelako?,"The correct answer is **A: Ikhamera ye-CCTV**.

Here's why:

The text states David O'Shannessy believes ""kubukwa kanye nekuhlolwa kwalapho kubulawela khona tilwane kufanele kube yintfo leyentiwa njalo e-Australia"" and that ""Levidiyo ye-CCTV nakanjani itotfumela umlayeto locinile kubo bonkhe bantfu labasebenta netilwane kutsi inhlalakahle yabo ibaluleke kwedlula konkhe."" This directly translates to a call for consistent monitoring with CCTV cameras in animal slaughterhouses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Noma ngubani losebenta netilwane** - While the CCTV is *for* those working with animals, the focus isn't on the people themselves, but on monitoring their actions.
*   **C: Kufakwa kwekugada** - The text doesn't mention increased security guards.
*   **D: Silaha** - Weapons are not mentioned in the text.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini lengasita ekuciniseni kubaluleka kwenhlalakahle yetilwane kubasebenti base-Australia labahlindzako?","The correct answer is **A: Kufakwa kwekhamera i-CCTV**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that CCTV footage ""will send a clear message to all people working with animals that their welfare is paramount."" This directly links CCTV cameras to improving the importance placed on animal welfare by those who work with them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Umhlangano lonemandla ne-RSPCA:** While the RSPCA is advocating for this, the meeting itself isn't what improves welfare, it's the *result* of the advocacy (the cameras).
*   **C: Kuhlolwa njalo kwesilaha:** The passage doesn't mention weapon inspections.
*   **D: Kunganyelwa kwe-ABC:** The ABC is simply reporting the news, not a solution to improve welfare.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini umsebenti walomuntfu loboshiwe?","The correct answer is **A: Mfundzi**.

The text states: ""...lomunye umfundzi uboshiwe mayelana nalokudubula kwasesikolweni..."" which translates to ""...another student was arrested in connection with the school shooting...""

Therefore, the person arrested is a student/mfundzi."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kungani kusabalala tindzaba tekutsi kubanjwe lomunye umngwabo loboshiwe ngoba bangaki labahlukumetekile?","The correct answer is **B: Kutsatfu**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""...umngcwabo wa-Jeff Weise nalabanye **labatsatfu** kulabantfu labayimfica..."" which translates to ""...Jeff Weise and **three** others of those who survived him..."".  The news of another arrest is spreading *because* three people were affected (survived/were impacted by) the shooting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kunye** - Means ""with"" - doesn't fit the context.
*   **C: Imfica** - Means ""survivors"" - while relevant to the shooting, it doesn't explain *why* news of a new arrest is spreading.
*   **D: Kune** - Means ""there are"" - doesn't fit the context.



"
Ekuphendvuleni umbhikisho nguliphi live lelingamange lichubekele phambili nesivumelwano salo se-ACTA?,"The correct answer is **B: I-Poland**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kulenyanga lendlulile, bekunemibhikisho leminingi lebeyenteka ePoland ngesikhatsi live lisayina i-ACTA, leyente kutsi hulumende wasePoland ancume kungasisayini sivumelwano, kwanyalo."" This directly indicates that Poland had significant protests *specifically* related to the ACTA agreement and successfully pressured their government to not sign it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ijalimani:** While Germany had protests, the text doesn't link them specifically to ACTA's rejection.
*   **C: E-Scotland:** Scotland had protests, but no mention of ACTA being the focus.
*   **D: I-Lithuania:** Lithuania is listed as a place where protests *occurred*, but not one where the protests led to a change in policy regarding ACTA.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngumaphi emave lalandzelako kuhlehlisa inchubo yekujoyina i-ACTA?","The correct answer is **D: I-Latvia**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ILatvia neSlovakia bonkhe baphutile ngeluhlelo lwekujoyina i-ACTA."" This directly translates to ""Both Latvia and Slovakia backed down from the plan to join ACTA."" 

The question asks which countries *withdrew* from joining ACTA, and Latvia is explicitly mentioned as doing so.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I-Estonia** - The passage mentions protests *in* Estonia, but doesn't say it withdrew from ACTA.
*   **B: I-Lithuania** - The passage mentions protests *in* Lithuania, but doesn't say it withdrew from ACTA.
*   **C: E-Scotland** - The passage mentions protests *in* Scotland, but doesn't say it withdrew from ACTA.



"
Bangaki bantfu labalimele ngenca yetigameko tekushisa kakhulu kwe-iPod?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The text states: ""...creating a relatively small but concerning number of fire incidents and **four** people injured."" 

Therefore, four people were injured due to the overheating iPod incidents."
Ngubani lowatse sigameko sekushisa ngalokwecile besingasisibi kakhulu?,"The correct answer is **A: I-METI**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""INdvuna yeliTiko Letemnotfo, Netekutsengiselana eJapan (MET) itse beloku ngetingoti letingu 27 letimayelana nemadivaysi."" This translates to ""The Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced today 27 reports relating to the devices.""  The text then goes on to say METI investigated and Apple reported 34 incidents.  Therefore, METI is the entity that addressed and investigated the overheating incidents.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Umnikati we-iPod ufakiwe:** The passage doesn’t mention individual owners reporting, but rather reports *about* the devices.
*   **C: Sikhungo saseJapan semlilo:** While fires were a result of the overheating, the passage doesn't mention a fire department specifically.
*   **D: Lihhabhula:** This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
Ngesikhatsi senkhuluma indzaba Steve Jobs atsi li-apula litayisungula ngekushesha?,"The correct answer is **B: Lolucingo** (The phone).

Here's why:

The passage states Steve Jobs said, ""Lamuhla i-Apple itokwakha kabusha **lucingo**..."" which translates to ""Today Apple is going to reinvent **the phone**..."" 

Therefore, he was saying Apple would revolutionize the phone.



"
Bekuyini inhloso yenkhuluma ya-Steve Jobs yemahora lamabili?,"The correct answer is **C: Kucalisa makhalekhikhini** (To launch a cellphone).

Here's why:

The passage states Steve Jobs *revealed the iPhone* during his two-hour speech and said Apple would ""reinvent the phone."" This clearly indicates the purpose of the speech was to **launch a cellphone** (makhalekhikhini).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kucalisa ithebulethi lesha** (To launch a new tablet) - The passage focuses solely on the iPhone, not a tablet.
*   **B: Kucalisa ngcondvomshini** (To launch an engine) -  This is completely unrelated to Apple and Steve Jobs' known products.
*   **D: kumemetela umhlalaphasi wakhe** (To announce his successor) - The passage doesn't mention anything about announcing a successor.



"
Yindzaba Cristina Fernandez ayikamenteli enkhundleni yemidlalo yase-Argentine?,"The correct answer is **C: Umkhankaso wakhe welitsimba lesifundzve sase-Buenos Aires**.

Here's why:

The passage states Mrs. Kirchner *began her 2005 campaign for Senate representing the Province of Buenos Aires* at the Argentine Theatre. This directly relates to her campaign within Buenos Aires province.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Longenele lukhutfo lokungamela** - The passage doesn't mention anything about a representative.
*   **B: Inhloso yakhe yekuphatsa umbuso** - While she aspires to be president, the passage focuses on the *start* of a specific campaign, not her overall ambition.
*   **D: Luhlelo lwakhe lekushiya sikhundla sekuba lilunga lephalamende njenganyalo** -  The passage does not discuss her plans to leave a parliamentary position.



"
Christina Fernandez umemetele kuphi inhloso yakhe yekugijima?,"The correct answer is **B: e-Buenos aires inkundla e-La Plata**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...utfule inhloso yakhe yekungenela kuba ngumongameli e-Argentine Theatre, indzawo layisebentisa ngesikhatsi acala umkhankaso wakhe wanga-2005...eLa Plata, lidolobha lelichele ngemakhilomitha langu-50 (emamayela langu-31) eBuenos Aires.""

This translates to: ""...announced her intention to run for president at the Argentine Theatre, a place she used when she began her 2005 campaign...in La Plata, a city located 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires.""

Therefore, she announced her intention in La Plata, which is near Buenos Aires.



"
Yini letfolwe yi-ACMA mayelana neBig brother?,"The correct answer is **A: Imitsetfo yokucwaninga beyingakaphulwa** (The research standards were not broken).

Here's why:

The text states: ""I-ACMA nayo itfole kutsi nanome levidiyo idlaliwe ku-inthanethi, i-Big Brother ayikaphuli imitsetfo yalokuvumelekile kufakwa ku-inthanethi"" which translates to ""ACMA also found that even if a video is played online, Big Brother has not broken the accepted standards for being put online.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The text doesn't mention media being complicit.
*   **C:** The text directly states the standards *were not* broken.
*   **D:** While the text mentions online broadcasting being regulated, it doesn’t say the broadcasting *was* found to be problematic.



"
Ngutiphi tinhlaka lekufanele imidiya iwele ngaphasi kwayo kute icabangele lokucuketfwe i-inthanethi?,"The correct answer is **D: Kufanele ngigunyatwe yi-AcmA (It must be authorized by ACMA)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Broadcasting Services Act allows for regulation of online content, *but* content must remain hosted on the internet.  Crucially, it also states that Big Brother hasn't breached rules *because the content isn't hosted on their website*. This implies a need for authorization/regulation by ACMA (the I-ACMA mentioned in the text) *before* content is legally allowed to be broadcast online.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kufanele ngisakatwe ku-inthaneyhi (It must be scattered on the internet):**  This is the opposite of what the passage implies.  Regulation suggests control, not scattering.
* **B: Kumele ngekweliciniso uhlale endzaweni ukhonta (It must truthfully remain where it points):** This is unclear and doesn't relate to the regulatory aspect.
* **C: Angikwati kugcinwa ku-webhusayidi (I cannot be stored on a website):** While true in the *example* given (Big Brother isn't hosting it), this isn't a general rule for all online content. The passage implies content *can* be online, just regulated.



"
Ngubani umholi we-Liberal Party yase-Australia?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngu-John Howard**.

The text states Peter Costello is positioned to *follow* John Howard as leader of the Liberal Party. This means John Howard is currently the leader.
"
Kungani i-Australia ibete kwakudzala imboni yemandla enuzi ?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuphikiswana kakhulu** (It is highly controversial).

Here's why:

The passage states that Mr. Costello believes Australia should consider nuclear power ""if it became available,"" but also says “there shouldn’t be an ideological opposition to nuclear power.” This implies that there *is* opposition, making it controversial. The passage doesn’t mention cost, feasibility or public support directly.



"
Ngumuphi umshwibi locudzelana naye ngelusito lemhlahlandlela?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngu-Anna Jochemsen**.

The text states: ""nga-Anna Jochemsen locedze asendzweni yemfica kubantfu besifazane kuSuper-G itolo"". This directly translates to ""Anna Jochemsen finished in first place in the women's Super-G race."" Therefore, she is the skier who finished first."
Nguliphi live lelicadze endzaweni Yelishimi ku-Super-G Kubesifazana labamile?,"The correct answer is **B: I-Netherlands**.

The text states: ""Tifaka ekhatsi iNetherlands, nga-Anna Jochemsen locedze asendzweni yemfica kubantfu besifazane kuSuper-G itolo..."" which translates to ""Including the Netherlands, with Anna Jochemsen finishing in first place for women in the Super-G race..."" 

Therefore, Anna Jochemsen from the Netherlands finished in first place."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngusiphi sitatimende lesimayelana ne-Blake lesingasiso selucobo?","The correct answer is **A: Waboshwa kulendzawo yesigameko**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Lona lowetfula tinhlelo, loboshwe kulendzawo yalesigameko..."" (This perpetrator, arrested at the scene of the incident...) This directly confirms Blake was arrested at the scene.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Wavuma kuhlasela (He admitted to assaulting):** The text says he *denied* assaulting anyone (""uphikile kutsi kunebantfu labekabahlasela"").
* **C: Wasebentise lipali ngesikhatsi sekuhlasela (He used a weapon during the assault):** The text states he used it for self-defense against a crowd throwing bottles, not as an initial attack.
* **D: Watse emabhodlela ajikijelwe kuye (Bottles were thrown at him):** While the text mentions bottles being thrown *at him*, it doesn't say he *received* them. It's a detail about the situation, not a statement about Blake himself.



"
"Ngalokusekelwe kulendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungamange kwente ku-Blake?","The correct answer is **D: Watjelwa kutsi kungenteka atfunyelwe ejele**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lelijaji latjela Blake kutsi """"cishe kutokwenteka"""" kutsi utotfunyelwa ejele."" This translates to ""The judge told Blake that it was """"highly likely"""" he would be imprisoned."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Watfolakala anelicala lekuhlaneketela bulungiswa** - The passage states he was found guilty of obstructing the police, not interfering with justice.
*   **B: Waboshwa** - The passage states he *was* arrested, but the question asks about something happening *based on the passage*, and the judge's statement is the key takeaway.
*   **C: Wahlaselwa ngelipali** - The passage states someone else (the person Blake was defending himself against) was attacked with bottles, not Blake.



"
Ingabe yini sikhwama se-U.N. sekufutfumala kwemhlaba ngekwawo lesingeke sisetjentiselwe kona?,"The correct answer is **C: Tindlu letivikeleke etikhukhuleni**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Lemali ingasetjentiselwa **tindlu letivimbela tikhukhula**, kunakekela emanti kancono, nekwandziswa kwetitjalo.""  This directly links the UN funding to building houses that protect against storms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kukhulisa titjalo letihlukene esivandzini sinye** - While increasing plant growth is mentioned, it's *one* use of the funds, not something the funds *won't* be used for.
*   **B: Kuletsa buchwepheshe emaveni latfutfukako** - The passage talks about *teaching* others skills, not bringing in technology directly.
*   **D: Kunciphisa imiphumela yekufutfumala kwemhlaba ngekwawo** - This is a general goal, but the passage specifies *how* the money will be used to achieve that goal - through things like storm-resistant houses.



"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, yini i-U.N. lenelitsemba lekuyisindzisa?","The correct answer is **A: Imali, ngekwabelana ngebuchwepheshe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I-U.N. nayo yetsemba kutsi itawucedzela kuhlanganisa imali yekusita emave lahlaselwe kushisa kakhulu kwemhlaba kuze akhone kubhekana nemiphumela loko lokuwuletsile. ...Lemali ingasetjentiselwa tindlu letivimbela tikhukhula, kunakekela emanti kancono, nekwandziswa kwetitjalo.""  It also mentions ""kufundzisa labanye ngebuchwephesha"" (teaching others about expertise).

Therefore, the UN hopes to mobilize **money** and share **expertise** to help those affected by climate change.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Titjalo** - While the money *could* be used for plants, that's a consequence of the UN's goal, not the goal itself.
*   **C: Emahlatsi emvula lasele** - The passage mentions protecting forests, but the UN's hope isn't *to save* the forests themselves, but to use resources to help communities.
*   **D: Bantfu labatsikametwe kungaphatfwa kahle kwemanti** -  Better water management is *part* of what the money could be used for, but not the overall hope.



"
Ngukuphu kulokulandzelako lonkungangabalilwa mngu-Albert McCall njengalamanye lokusamele kuvunyelwane ngawo?,"The correct answer is **B: Lusuku kuhweba lokungacala ngalo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Albert Muchanga said, """"Sisengakavumi mayelana nemitsetfo yemisuka nekukhokha nekuvumelana ngemitselo, kodvwa luhlaka lesinalo lanele kucala kuhweba ngaKholwane 1, 2020"""" (We haven't agreed on rules of origin, payments and tariffs, but the framework we have is sufficient to start trading on January 1, 2020).  

This directly states a date for the start of trading.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I-Benin itawujuyona i-AFCTA** - The passage mentions Benin *joining* but doesn't state it's a confirmed agreement. It's still being discussed.
*   **C: Imitsetfo yekucala** - The passage explicitly says they *haven't* agreed on the initial tariffs.
*   **D: Imvume yentsela** - The passage doesn't discuss agreements related to pathways or corridors.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kungani kuhweba kungacali ngeNhlaba?","The correct answer is **B: Kuneluhlaka lolwanene lwemitsetfo kanye nemvumelwano lekhona**.

Here's why:

The passage states, """"Sisengakavumi mayelana nemitsetfo yemisuka nekukhokha nekuvumelana ngemitselo, kodvwa **luhlaka lesinalo lanele kucala kuhweba ngaKholwane 1, 2020**"""" This directly translates to ""We are not yet in agreement on tariffs and payments and settling disputes, but **the framework we have is sufficient to start trading on January 1, 2020**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't say the date was part of Nigeria's timeline, it's the date trading *could* start despite ongoing disagreements.
*   **C:** While the commissioner made an announcement, the passage focuses on the *reason* for starting trade, not just that it was announced.
*   **D:** The passage explicitly states they *haven't* agreed on tariffs and pricing.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, liphephandzaba lase-Atlanta lasola ngani tikhulu tetemfundvo?","The correct answer is **D: Kubika emaphuzu ekuhlolwa laphasi**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""The Atlanta Journal-Constitution released a report showing problems with the test results. The report showed that test scores had risen sharply, and that the school system had been aware of problems but covered them up."" This directly indicates the newspaper accused the school officials of manipulating test scores (""reporting test scores down"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuphazamisa umbiko wemtsetfo sisekelo jikelele** - While there was a problem with the integrity of testing, the article doesn't mention disrupting a foundational report.
* **B: Kwehluleka kusungul imfundvo yasemadolobheni** - The passage focuses on cheating on tests, not the overall establishment of urban education.
* **C: Kungasebenti ngetinkinga taphakatsi letitholiwe** - The article states they *covered up* problems, not that they failed to address community issues.



"
"Ngalokusekelwe elwatini loluniketwwe endzimeni, yini lekungakashiwo ku-journal-Constitution?","The correct answer is **A: Kutfutfukiswa kwemaphuzu ekuhlolwa lokungakatayeleki (Unaccounted for improvement in test scores)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that *The Atlanta Journal-Constitution* published a report showing problems with the test results, indicating the scores had increased rapidly and the school system covered up issues found. This directly relates to an unexplained or unaccounted-for increase in test scores.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bufakazi bekutsi emaphepha eluhlolo aphatamiswa (Evidence that test papers were tampered with)** - While the passage does mention test papers were altered, it doesn't say the *Journal-Constitution* revealed this evidence. It states the alteration was *proven* in 2013.
*   **C: 2013 loyinduna yavelonkhe (2013 was the year of the superintendent)** - The passage states the superintendent won an award in 2009 and that the tampering was proven in 2013. It doesn't say 2013 was the year of the superintendent.
*   **D: Tikhalo tekusungula imfundvo yasedolobheni (Complaints about establishing the urban education)** - The passage doesn't mention any complaints about establishing urban education; it focuses on test score manipulation.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, nguluphi lwati lolatiwako mayelana nekubhoma?","The correct answer is **D: Linani lalabashonile lelisemtsetfweni** (The number of injured people currently known).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...imibiko icinisekisa kutsi bangu-30 labalimele; kepha kwanyalo kusete tibalo leticinisekisiwe."" (Reports confirm 30 are injured, but currently there are no confirmed numbers). This directly addresses the current state of knowledge regarding the number of injured.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: linani lekugcina lekulimala** (The final number of damage) - The passage doesn't mention the *final* extent of the damage, only that bombs exploded.
* **B: Ngutiphi takhiwo ibhomu lechume dvute nato** (Which building the bomb exploded near) - The passage says the bombs exploded ""eceleni kwetakhiwo tahulumende"" (near a government building), but doesn’t specify *which* building.
* **C: Uma ibhomu leyentiwe lapho kufanele ihlotjiswe** (If the bomb was made where it should have been made) -  The passage doesn’t discuss the *making* or proper handling of the bombs, only the fact that they exploded.



"
"Soloku wajoyina iManchester City ngo-2017, mingaki imidlalo layidlalile Jesus?","The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The passage states: ""Kusukela ngaleso sikhatsi lomdlali waseBrazil sewudlale emahlandla langu-53 kulelicembu lakhe kuyo yonkhe imicudzelwane..."" (Since then the Brazilian player has played 53 times for his team in all competitions...).



"
Nguliphi licembu lapho Jesus bekathola £27 million ngekuyijoyina?,"The correct answer is **A: I-Palmeiras**.

The passage states Jesus joined Manchester City *from* Palmeiras for £27 million. Therefore, Palmeiras is the team that received the money."
ngusiphi sitatimende lesingasilo liciniso mayelana tivakashi tasehhotela?,"The correct answer is **D: Liningi letivakashi betivela edolobheni lelincwele**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Letivakashi tasehostela ikakhulu bekutakhamuti tase-United Arab Emirates"" (The guests at the hostel were mostly nationals of the United Arab Emirates). This directly contradicts the statement that many of the guests came from the holy city (Mecca).

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

*   **A: Tihambeli betise-Mecca lapho tihambela khona** (They are visiting Mecca when they visit) - This is true, as the hostel is in Mecca.
*   **B: Letinye tetivakashi bekungasito takhamuti tendzawo** (Some of the guests were not local nationals) - This is true, because the majority were from the UAE, implying some were not local to Mecca.
*   **C: Tivakashi** (Guests) - This is a basic statement and clearly true.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngusiphi sitatimende saletilandzelako lesiliciniso?","The correct answer is **D: Liningi letivakashi lihlala eMecca**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the hostel provides accommodation for many visitors *coming to visit the holy city* (Mecca) and those undertaking the Hajj pilgrimage. This directly supports the idea that many visitors stay in Mecca.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kute labashonile** - The passage explicitly states at least 15 people have died, and the number is expected to rise.
*   **B: Tonkhe tivakashi tibuya e-United Arab Emirates** - The passage says *most* of the hostel's guests are from the UAE, not *all*.
*   **C: Letivakashi betikhona ngelusuku lekwandulela hajj** - The passage mentions the Hajj pilgrimage, but doesn't specify they were there the day before. It says the hostel is used during the Hajj.



"
"Ngalokusekelwe endzimeni, kutsi nguluphi lwati mayelana nekuhlangana lokungacaci?","The correct answer is **A: Bukhulu bekushayisana**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Bososayensi batsi kuchuma lokwabangelwa ngulokushayisana kwaba kukhulu kakhulu."" (Scientists say the impact was caused by a very large collision). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Indzawo yekushayisana** - While the passage mentions the object hit 491 miles *above* Earth, it doesn't detail the *location* of the impact itself.
*   **C: Utselela wekushayisana emhlabeni** - The passage doesn't discuss the effect of the collision *on* Earth, only that it happened above it.
*   **D: Indzawo yemfecumfecu** - While the U.S. Strategic Command is investigating the debris, the passage focuses on what scientists believe *caused* the event, not the debris field itself.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini lesadzinga kuncunywa mayelana nekushayisana?","The correct answer is **D: Sikali lekungiso sekuphahlaka** (The scale of the deformation).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bososayensi batsi kuchuma lokwabangelwa ngulokushayisana kwaba kukhulu kakhulu. Basetama kutfola kutsi kube ngakanani lokuphihliteka nekutsi uMhlaba utsikameteke njani.""  This translates to: ""Scientists say the impact was caused by a very large collision. They are trying to find out how much deformation there was and how the Earth was affected.""

This directly indicates that determining the *scale of the deformation* is what needs to be investigated.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngubani lotophatsa kulandzela idodi** (Who is responsible for following up on the debris) - The passage mentions the U.S. Department of Defense is seeking debris, but doesn't state this is what *needs to be figured out*.
*   **B: Kutsi masethelayithi bewahamba ngekushesha lokungakanani ngalesikhatsi kushayisana** (How fast the meteorite was traveling at the time of impact) - The speed is already stated in the passage (17,500 mph).
*   **C: Kutsi imiphumela yekuhlatiya litulo litowabiwa njani** (How the results of the analysis will be shared) - While the passage mentions the results will be put on a public website, it's not the primary thing that *needs to be determined*.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, nguyiphi indzawo Batten lake wayibamba ehlwini lwaseMelika lebantfu labacebe kakhulu?","The correct answer is **A: Yesi-400**.

The passage states: ""Batten wabalwa njengewesi-190 nga-2008 kubantfu labangu-400 Labanjingile e-Melika..."" which translates to ""Batten was ranked as 190th in 2008 among the 400 richest people in America..."" 

Therefore, he was within the top 400. While his rank was specifically 190, the question asks about his position *in the list* of 400.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lapho Batten ente umnikelo khona?,"The correct answer is **B: Enyuvesi yase-Virginia**.

The text specifically states that Batten ""wetfweswa ticu eKolishi Letebuciko Nesayensi yaseNyuvesi yeVirginia"" (was educated at the College of Arts and Sciences of the University of Virginia) and ""bekafaka sandla ekunikeleni kuleso sikolwa"" (contributed to that school). This directly indicates he made a contribution to the University of Virginia.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Luhlu lolucebe kakhulu eMelika** - The text mentions his wealth but doesn't say he contributed to a list of the wealthiest.
*   **C: Inombolo lenkhulu yetikhungo** - The text only mentions one institution, the University of Virginia.
*   **D: Emakolishi laniketelwe tabuciko kanye nesayensi** - While the text mentions the College of Arts and Sciences, it doesn't say he contributed to *multiple* colleges of this type."
Litsini ligalelo lemtsetfo sivivinya losayinwe umbusi Arnold Schwarzenegger?,"The correct answer is **A: Kuvimbelwa kwekutsengisa noma kwekucashwa kwemidlalo yevidiyo leneludlame kulo lonkhe lase-California** (Preventing the sale or rental of violent video games throughout California).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states the law ""umtsetfo lovala kudayisela nobe kucashisela ebantfwana ngemavidiyo lanebudlova"" which translates to ""a law prohibiting the sale or rental to children of violent video games"".  The law aims to restrict access to violent video games *within* California.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tinhlawulo temali yalabente lokubi** (Fines for bad behavior) - While fines *are* mentioned ($1000 per offense), they are a *result* of breaking the law, not the law's main purpose.
* **C: Kuvimbelwa kwekutsengisa noma kwekucashwa kwemidlalo yevidiyo neludlame ngaphandle kwe-California** (Preventing the sale or rental of violent video games outside of California) - The law applies specifically *in* California.
* **D: Imfuneko Yedecal emidlalweni leneludlame** (Requirement for a decal on violent games) -  The law requires a label (""18""), but the *purpose* isn't just the label itself, it's to restrict sales to minors.



"
"Ngekusho kwenzima, ngubani londlulwe ngulokukhulumiwe?","The correct answer is **C: Ngu-Miller**.

Here's why:

The passage states Miller is the one being talked *about* (""nokunguye lendzaba lecondzene naye"" - and he is the subject of the story).  Mike is quoted *responding* to something said about the case, and Duvall is mentioned as having children, but Miller is the person the discussion revolves around. The question asks who is ""londlulwe ngulokukhulumiwe"" - meaning who is being talked *about*.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokuliciniso kulokuhlangene nako kwa-Miller ekucileni macala?","The correct answer is **B: Bekangakanaki ngalesikhatsi atilungiselela**.

Here's why:

The passage states Miller said, """"Mike ukhuluma kakhulu nakuchubeka lelicala...bengitilungiselela ngako-ke angivanga kahle kutsi bekatsini""""."" This translates to ""Mike talks a lot during the trial...I was preparing for it and didn't hear clearly what was happening.""  This directly indicates he was *not* fully focused because he was preparing something else.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Duvall wente umbono ku-Miller ngesikhatsi sekulalela emacala** - The passage doesn't mention Duvall offering an opinion to Miller.
*   **C: Bantfwana baDuvall lababili bakhuluma kakhulu ngesikhatsi sekulalelwa kwelicala** - The passage mentions Duvall's children were present, but doesn't say they were the ones talking a lot – Mike (presumably someone else) is said to be talking a lot.
*   **D: Bekayinakisisile indzaba yaDuvall** - The passage doesn't state whether Miller had thoroughly investigated Duvall's case; it focuses on his distraction during the trial.



"
Ngubani lophakamise kutsi kubuyeketwe ‘Umtsetfo Wemoya Lohlantekile’?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngu-Stephen Harper**.

The text states: ""Ndvunankhulu Stephen Harper uvumile kutfumela umtsetfo wahulumende lotsi 'Clean Air Act' ekomidini kuze iwubuyekete..."" which translates to ""Prime Minister Stephen Harper agreed to send the government's 'Clean Air Act' back to committee for revision...""

Therefore, Stephen Harper is the one who proposed the review of the ‘Clean Air Act’."
Ngubani lophikile kutsi “sento semoya lohlobile” besisebentiswa njenge sento sangaphambi kwelukhetfo?,"The correct answer is **D: I-federal MP**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kepha Ndvunankhulu John Howard utsite lesento bekungesekuvikela sakhiwo sasesibhedlela ekutsini singehliselwa esigabeni lesiphansi nguhulumende waseTasmanian, ngekukhipha tigidzi temadola letingu-AUD$45.""  This translates to: ""But Prime Minister John Howard cited this as not being about protecting the hospital building from being lowered into the ground by the Tasmanian government, by releasing tens of millions of AUD$45 dollars.""

This means members of parliament (MPs) opposed the use of the funding as a pre-election issue. The Prime Minister defended it.



"
Takhi te-cyanuric acid nemelamine takha ini lapho uma tisabela emchameni wakati?,"The correct answer is **C: Emakristali**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bacwaningi kulenyuvesi batsi letinhlanganisela letimbili tiyahlangana kuze takhe **emakristalu** lokungenteka avale tinso."" (Researchers at the university said the two compounds combine to form **crystals** that appear like sand.)  The question asks what they *form* when they react in the cat's bladder.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tinso** - The crystals *look like* sand, but they *are* crystals.
*   **B: Kudla kwetilwane letifuywako** - This is the source of the contamination, not what's formed in the bladder.
*   **D: I-spectroscopy ye-infrared** - This is a method used to analyze the crystals (FTIR), not what they are.



"
Yini indzaba bacwaningi basebentise i-infrared spectroscopy kute bayibone?,"The correct answer is **B: Kwakheka kwe-kristali emchameni wesilwane lesifuywako**.

Here's why:

* The passage states ""Bacwaningi babona emakristali akheka emchameni welikati... Indlela loluhlobo lwemakhambi lolwakheke ngayo luyafana nalawa latfolwe emchameni wetilwane letitsintsekile nangabe ucatsaniswa ngesikali samakhemikhali (FTIR).""  This directly links FTIR (infrared spectroscopy) to identifying the *formation of crystals* in the animal tissues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kusebenta kwetinso** - The passage mentions that the crystals can cause kidney damage, but the spectroscopy wasn't used to directly study kidney function.
* **C: Tilwane letifuywako letitsintsekako** - While the passage *compares* findings to sick animals, the spectroscopy was used to analyze the current samples, not simply identify sick animals.
* **D: Kudla kwesilwane lesifuywako lokungcolile** - The contaminated food is the *source* of the problem, but FTIR was used to analyze the crystals *within* the animal tissue.



"
Ngubani lowabita Luna njenge “ndlovukati Yekwecisa”?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngu-Tommy Dreamer**.

The text states: ""Tommy Dreamer watsi, """"Luna bekayiNdlovukazi yekucala Leyendlulele."""" (Tommy Dreamer said, ""Luna was the first Wonder Woman."")

Therefore, Tommy Dreamer is the one who called Luna “Ndlovukati Yekwecisa” (Wonder Woman)."
Ngubani lobite Luna ngekutsi “uyahlanya”?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngu-Dustin Runnels**.

The text states: ""Dustin """"Goldust"""" Runnels uphawule ngekutsi """"Luna uyacaka njengami...kungenteka ucaka kakhulu yena..."""" which translates to ""Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels commented that 'Luna is crazy like me...she might be crazier than me...'"".
"
Yini lengazange yenteke kulomshayeli lobandzakanyeke engotini?,"The correct answer is **C: Wasuswa esibhedlela eCambridge wayiswa ekulesinye eGreat Yarmouth**.

Here's why:

The text states the driver was *transferred* from James Paget (Great Yarmouth) *to* Addenbrooke (Cambridge). It doesn't say they were moved *from* Cambridge back to Great Yarmouth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Walimala inhloko** - The text explicitly states the driver was severely injured in the head.
*   **B: Akazange alimate namunye webantfu phakatsi ekhaya** - The text says no one else in the house was injured.
*   **D: Bestimo letiphuthumako bamsitile bamkhipha emotweni yakhe** - The text mentions emergency services extracting the driver from the car.



"
Yini lebeyingagcamanga ngemdlalo weNingizimu Afrika ngesikhatsi semchudzelwano welibhola lembhoco.,"The correct answer is **D: Emakhono ekutivikela (Defensive skills)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Idifensi yabo lefundzisekile...kwenta kutsi bahlabane"" which translates to ""Their trained defense...made them win.""  This directly highlights their strong defensive skills as a key factor in their success.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Kusebentisana kwelicembu lokuhlaba umchele (Teamwork in scoring tries):** While they *won* by scoring, the text doesn't specifically focus on their scoring teamwork.
* **B: Likhono lekuphatsa ibhola (Ball handling skill):** The text mentions ""emakhono ekubamba ibhola"" (skills in catching the ball) but doesn't emphasize this as the *primary* reason for their victory.
* **C: Umdlalo lophuculiwe ekucaleni kwemchudzelwano (Improved game at the beginning of the tournament):** The text states they ""raised their level as the tournament progressed,"" not at the beginning.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, umdlalo waseNingizimu Afrika ucale nini kuba ncono?","The correct answer is **D: Njengoba umcudzelwano uchubeka**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""iNingizimu Afrika itse kuphakamisa lizinga ngesikhatsi lomcudzelwano usachubeka"" which translates to ""South Africa itself raised its level as the tournament progressed."" This directly indicates their play improved *during* the tournament, not at a specific time like 10:00 AM, after a loss, or solely due to defense.



"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, ngusiphi kuletitatimende letilandzelako lesingakhombosi ngalokungiko umnotfo wase-China?","The correct answer is **D: I-China ayikase itfumele timoto ngaphandle kundlila iJalimani.**

Here's why:

The passage *specifically states* that China recently surpassed Germany in auto exports.  Therefore, the statement that China hasn't exported more cars than Germany is **false** according to the text.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Umnotfo wase-China ukhule kakhulu kusukela bente tingucuko.** - The passage states the economic growth began under Deng Xiaoping and has grown by over 90%, showing significant growth after reforms.
*   **B: I-China inemakhethi lenkhulu yekutfumela timoto kulamanye emave kundlula i-United States.** - The passage explicitly states China surpassed both Germany *and* the United States in auto exports.
*   **C: I-China ingagcina ibe ne-GDP lenkhulu kune-United States** - The passage suggests this is a possibility within the next 20 years.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, i-GDP yaseChina ingayindlula nini yase-United State?","The correct answer is **B: Emkhatsini kwemashumi lamabili emnyaka** (Within the next two decades).

The passage states: ""Umnotfo waseShayina ungase ube mkhulu kunowaseMelika kungakapheli iminyaka lengamashumi lamabili."" This translates to ""The Chinese economy may be larger than the American one within the next two decades.""
"
Huwaphakamisa kutsi emave lasatfutfuka enteni?,"The correct answer is **D: Kugwema indlela lendzala yekungcola** (To avoid the old way of polluting).

Here's why:

The text specifically quotes Hu as advocating for countries to ""avoid the old way of polluting first and then gradually improve with the passage of time."" This is the core of his suggestion for developing nations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Batsetse tibopho letichilita sigaba sabo sekutfutfuka** (Accept commitments suitable for their stage of development) - While related to his overall message, it's not the *specific* suggestion he makes.
*   **B: Gcila ekuphumeni kwemnotho** (Focus on economic growth) - The text doesn't highlight economic growth as his proposal, but rather *how* to achieve it sustainably.
*   **C: Bandlulele ngale kwetibopho tabo tamanje** (Exceed their current commitments) - He explicitly states the opposite - that they shouldn't be asked to take on more than they can handle.



"
Lokungakashiwo ngu-Hu?,"The correct answer is **B: Seluleko emaveni lasatfutfuka mayelana nekungcola**.

Here's why:

* The passage states Hu ""khutsatse emave latfutfukako """"kutsi agweme lendlela lendzala yekungcolisa kucala bese ayakhuculula kuhlobisa ngekuhamba kwesikhatsi."""" which translates to ""urged developing countries to avoid the old path of pollution first and then try to catch up later."" This is clearly advice regarding pollution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sisekelo sekusikeka (Basis for reduction):** While the passage talks about reducing carbon emissions, it doesn't define a basis for that reduction.
* **C: Lusuku lapho kushiswa kwekhabhoni kutsembakala kutsi kutoncanyulwa khona (Date when carbon emissions are expected to peak):** The passage doesn’t mention any specific date.
* **D: Sibalo sekuncamuka kwekushiswa kwekhabhoni (Figure for carbon emission reduction):** The passage specifically states he *didn't* mention how much the emissions would fall.



"
Kunaku lokulandzelako ngukuphi Veerman latsite simo besingasikahle?,"The correct answer is **B: I-Angola**.

Here's why:

The text states Richard Veerman (speaking for Medicines Sans Frontieres) said: """"I-Angola ijakele ekubhedvukeni kwesimo lesibi kakhulu futsi lesimo sitohlala sisibi kakhulu e-Angola,"""" which translates to ""Angola is facing the worst health crisis and this situation will remain very bad in Angola.""  He's describing the bad situation *in* Angola.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Inhlangano i-Medecines Sans Frontieres:** Veerman represents this organization, but he's talking about the situation in Angola, not the organization itself being in a bad state.
*   **C: I-Mangola:** Mangola is the disease, but the quote focuses on the *impact* of the disease on a country.
*   **D: I-World Health Organization:** While the WHO is mentioned, Veerman is specifically commenting on Angola's situation.



"
Ngenca yemshushisi lototsatsa sikhundla saHuhne?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngu-Davey**.

The text states: ""Huhne usukile esikhundleni futsi lotofakwa esikhundleni sakhe kuKhebinethi nguEd Davey MP."" This translates to ""Huhne resigned from his position and was replaced in the Cabinet by Ed Davey MP."" 

Therefore, Davey took Huhne's position."
Ngubani lotobamba lichaza langcongcoshe wetemabhizinisi ngemuva kwekushushiswa?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngu-Lamb**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Norman Lamb MP kulindzeleke kutsi atsatse lomsebenti loshiywe nguDavey wekuba nguLobuke Temabhizinisi."" This translates to ""Norman Lamb MP is expected to take the job left by Davey of being the Business Secretary."" 

Therefore, Lamb will be the one in charge of the business portfolio after the reshuffle."
Yini loku badlali bakhutsata tibukeli kutsi tente ngesikhatsi se-operaye-Camille Saint-Saen?,"The correct answer is **C: Hlanganyela nabo esiteji kute badlale.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Labantfu labaphefomako babhema insangu nabasesiteji lokwenta kutsi wonkhe umuntfu lolangekhatsi afise kubhema.""  This translates to ""The performers smoked cannabis and used the stage to make everyone present want to smoke.""  This implies they were *encouraging the audience to participate* – to join them on stage (metaphorically or literally) in the experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bahlanganyele ekusebenteni kwe-cannabis:** While cannabis use is mentioned, the passage doesn’t say they encouraged audience *participation* in that activity, but rather that their performance *made* people want to.
*   **B: Tsatsa luhambo loluya eJapan:** The opera is *about* Japan, but the passage doesn't mention encouraging trips there.
*   **D: Vumela kuphila kwabo kubonwe nguloku lebakutsandzako:** This isn't supported by the text. The passage focuses on the performers' actions and their effect on the audience, not a display of their personal lives.



"
Ngubani locale wabhema ijoyinti ngesikhatsi se-opera?,"The correct answer is **C: Badlali** (Actors).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Labantfu labaphefomako babhema insangu nabasesiteji lokwenta kutsi wonkhe umuntfu lolangekhatsi afise kubhema.""  This translates to ""The performers smoked tobacco and staged things to make everyone who wasn't present want to smoke.""  

""Labantfu labaphefomako"" directly refers to the **actors** or performers in the opera. The passage focuses on what *they* did to encourage smoking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umculi (Singer):** While singers are performers, the passage refers to all those *performing* – which includes actors who might not sing.
* **B: Tetsameli tesiFrench (French audience):** The passage says the performers *made the audience* want to smoke, not that the audience themselves were smoking.
* **D: I-Camille Saint-Saens (Camille Saint-Saens):** He was the composer, not a performer in this context.



"
Nguliphi lelinye ligama le-”spacewalk” lelidlalwe ngu Leonov?,"The correct answer is **C: Umsebenti extravehicular**.

Here's why:

* The passage states Leonov performed the first ""extravehicular activity (EVA)"", which is then explained as being the same as a ""spacewalk"". 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umsebenti we-Apollo-Soyuz:** This was a later mission Leonov *led*, not a name for a spacewalk.
* **B: Umjaho we-space:** This is the broader context of the space race, not a name for a spacewalk.
* **D: I-Cosmonaut No. 11:** This is Leonov's designation, not a synonym for a spacewalk.



"
Leonov wahola incenye yeSoviet kumuphi umsebenti?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku-Apollo-Soyuz**.

The passage states: ""Ngemuva kweminyaka lelishumi, wahola iSoviet leyincenye yemsebenti we-Apollo–Soyuz lokhombisa kutsi leSpace Race isiphelile."" (After ten years, he led the Soviet part of the Apollo–Soyuz mission which showed that the Space Race was over.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Emjakweni we-space** - While Leonov was a cosmonaut and went to space, the passage specifically mentions him *leading* a part of the Apollo-Soyuz mission.
*   **C: I-Cosmonaut No. 11** - This is his designation, not a mission he led.
*   **D: Ku-EVA** - He *performed* an EVA, but didn't *lead* a mission related to it specifically mentioned in the text.



"
Ngubani lolemele kulengoti?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngu-Gibson**.

The text explicitly states: ""Nayicedza kwenteka lengoti Gibson waphutfunyiswa esibhedlela kodvwa wafa ngekushesha ngemva kwaloko."" (It ended with the accident that Gibson was injured in the hospital but died shortly after.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sisebenti sasegaraji:** The garage worker witnessed the accident and was upset, but wasn't *injured* in the accident itself.
*   **C: Bantfwana:** The children were frightened and crying, but the text doesn't say they were injured.
*   **D: Mshayeli weloli:** The text states ""akakalimalanga kulengoti"" (he was not injured in the accident).



"
Kwentekeni kulabantfu lababandzakanyeke kulengoti?,"The correct answer is **B: Munye bekangakalimali, munye ufile**.

Here's why:

* **Gibson** waphutfunyiswa esibhedlela kodvwa wafa (was injured in hospital but died).
* **Umshayeli waleloli** akalimalanga (the truck driver was not injured).

The passage explicitly states one person died and one was unharmed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bobabili bafile (Both died)** - The truck driver didn't die.
* **C: Bebamemeta futsi bakhala (They were crying and screaming)** - This describes the *witnesses* (the children), not the people directly involved in the accident (Gibson and the driver).
* **D: Bobabili balimele (Both were injured)** - Only Gibson was injured, and he died. The driver was not injured.



"
Bososayensi labasebenta kuleluhlelo bebanelitsemba lekubona imphumelelo lebangwa ngukuphi kulokulandzelako?,"The correct answer is **D: Indzaba lemnyama** (Dark Matter).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the desired result of the simulation was caused by ""amandla lashintjashintjako emkhatsini kwetintfo letimnyama tegalaxy netintfo letimnyama teMilky Way"" -  the interaction of dark matter between the Sagittarius and Milky Way galaxies. The entire simulation was built to understand how these *invisible* forces affect each other, mirroring how visible objects interact. The passage also mentions dark matter several times, establishing it as the core focus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Indzaba letayelekile (Common Story):** This is too vague and doesn't relate to the specific scientific focus of the simulation.
*   **B: Emandla elulwandle (Ocean Forces):** This is irrelevant to the context of galactic interactions.
*   **C: Timvitsi letincane kakhulu (Very Small Jokes):** This is completely unrelated to the passage.



"
Bososayensi bebabukisisa indzaba yakuphi kulokulandzelako?,"The correct answer is **D: I-Sagittarius galaxy kanye neMtsambo Wetinkhanyeti**.

Here's why:

The text specifically discusses the interaction between the Sagittarius galaxy and the Milky Way (referred to as ""Mtsambo Wetinkhanyeti"" in the text).  The research focuses on how the gravitational forces between these two galaxies are influencing each other, specifically looking at the role of dark matter.  The analogy to the moon affecting the Earth is used to illustrate this gravitational interaction, but the core subject is the two galaxies themselves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Utsambo Wetinkhanyeti kanye neNyanga:** While the moon is *mentioned* as an analogy, it's not the primary focus of the research.
*   **B: Umhlaba kanye neSagittarius galaxy:** The Earth is not a part of this study.
*   **C: Umhlaba kanye neNyanga:**  This is a familiar relationship but irrelevant to the passage’s central topic.



"
"Ngalokusekelwe kulendzima, yini lengagcekwa bagcini bemtsetfo?","The correct answer is **C: Bobani labaniketwa tinkontileka tekwakha kabusha** (Who was given the reconstruction contracts).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states there's controversy over the allocation of reconstruction funds *and* accusations that reconstruction efforts were skewed towards giving contracts to those favored in Washington.  This is the core of the complaint about the ""Bush-New Orleans agreement.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Imali yekusita (Aid money):** While the passage mentions funds, the *issue* isn't simply the existence of aid money, but *how it was distributed*.
* **B: Kweswela kwemzamo wekwakha kabusha (Failure of the reconstruction effort):** The passage doesn't focus on whether reconstruction failed, but *why* it might have been problematic (unfair contract allocation).
* **D: Imali yekwakha kabusha (Reconstruction money):**  Similar to A, the money itself isn't the core problem; it's the suspected favoritism in how it was spent.



"
Ngubani logceka emakontileka ekwakha kabusha kwemizamo yekusita ye-Hurricane Katrina?,"The correct answer is **D: Labaphakatsi e-washington**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kusolwa lokubanti ngemitamo yekwakha kabusha igcile ngekuniketa ngetinkontileka tekwakha kabusha kulabo lababukile labangekhetsi eWashington.""  This translates to: ""It is alleged that reconstruction efforts were focused on giving reconstruction contracts to those who were favored and chosen in Washington."" 

Therefore, people connected/based in Washington received the contracts.



"
"Ngekusho kwesicephu, tibani letivela emkhatsini kwe-Stardust titobonakala kuphi kucala?","The correct answer is **B: Enyakatho ye-California**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Leliphilisi litogijima ngesivinini lesingu-12.8 wemakhilomitha nobe emamayela langu-8 miles ngemzuzwana, litubane lelanele kusuka e-San Fransisco kuya e-Los Angeles ngomzuzu munye.""  Then it continues, ""Itawundlula ngenhla kwelugu laseningizimu neCalifornia bese ikhanyisa sibhakabhaka phakatsi ne-Oregon ichubekele eNevada nase-Idaho iye e-Utah.""

This indicates it will first be seen passing over Southern California and *then* illuminating the sky between Oregon, Nevada, Idaho, and Utah. The first visible location mentioned is therefore near Northern California (where San Francisco and Los Angeles are located).



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, umkhumbi-mkhatsi utocopha umlandvo wakuphi kulokulandzelako?","The correct answer is **C: Kubuyela emhlabeni ngekuphutfuma lokukhulu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""IStardust itobeka lirikhodi lelisha ngekuba ngumshini loya enyangeni losheshako kubuya eMhlabeni, iphula lirikhodi lelabekwa ngeNkhwenkhweti yanga-1969 ngesikhatsi kubuya i-Appolo X command module.""  This directly translates to ""Stardust will set a new record for being the fastest spacecraft to return to Earth, breaking the record set in July 1969 when the Apollo X command module returned.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kukhanyisa luhla lwesibhakabhaka lolubanti kakhuku** - While the spacecraft *will* illuminate the sky, this isn't the historical record it's breaking.
*   **B: Kunonakala emadolobheni lamakhulu** - The passage does not mention any damage to cities.
*   **D: Kuhamba usuka e-San Francisco uye e-Los Angeles kuphutfuma lokukhulu** - While it's mentioned as an example of its speed, this isn't the historical achievement.



"
Uhlobene njani Dkt Malar Balasubramanian Ku-Saroja Balasubramaniam?,"The correct answer is **C: Make**.

The text states: ""...kutsi make wakhe atfolakale afile..."" which translates to ""...that his mother was found dead..."". This directly indicates that Saroja Balasubramanian was Dr. Malar Balasubramanian’s mother.
"
Watfolakala kuphi umtimba waSara Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **B: Eceleni kwemgwaco**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dkt. Malar Balasubramanian, 29, watfolakala eBlue Ash, e-Ohio, indzawo lengaba ngemamayela langu-15 enyakatfo yeCincinnati ehleti phansi emhlabatsini **eceleni kwemgwaco**..."" and then later mentions the body of Saroja Balasubramanian was found there too.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E-Cincinnati** - While Blue Ash is near Cincinnati, the body wasn't *in* Cincinnati, but beside a road *near* Cincinnati.
*   **C: Ebhuthini yemoto** - The doctor was found in the car, but the mother's body was found on the ground beside the road.
*   **D: E-Pittsburgh** - The doctor works in Pittsburgh, but the body was found in Ohio.



"
Yini letholwe I-eBay?,"The correct answer is **A: I-Microsoft**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Kuyintfo lekhulu letfoliwe emlandvweni wa-eBay."" (A major thing found in eBay's history).  It then goes on to say the company plans to divide its profit streams and focus on areas where Skype is strong. Skype is owned by Microsoft. Therefore, eBay found Microsoft to be a major element in their history, likely through data analysis or business impact.



"
Yini lefuna kukuzuza i-eBay ngalokutsenga?,"The correct answer is **B: Kwandzela etindzaweni letinsha** (Expand into new areas).

Here's why:

The passage states eBay plans to ""split its profit pools and focus on areas where Skype has a strong position, such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil."" This directly indicates they are aiming to expand their reach into new geographic markets where Skype is already popular.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hlanganisa imali lengenako (Generate income)** - While increasing profits is the ultimate goal, the passage doesn't say the acquisition is *for* generating income, but rather *how* they will generate income (by focusing on specific areas).
*   **C: Phakamisa iphrofayili yako (Raise your profile)** - The focus is on geographic expansion, not overall brand awareness.
*   **D: Kwenelisa baninimasheya abo (Satisfy shareholders)** - This is a general business goal, not the specific reason for this strategic move.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubani longazange achumane netiboshwa letisala egcekeni ngemuva kwekulwa?","The correct answer is **A: Labacocisana nabo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Labacocisani bazama kulungisa lesimo, kepha letiboshwa ativakali kutsi tifunani."" This translates to ""The mediators tried to fix the situation, but the prisoners didn't respond to what they wanted."" This indicates the mediators attempted to communicate with the prisoners but weren't successful in engaging with them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tisebenti telusito lemlilo (Firefighters):** The text specifically states firefighters *did* engage with the prisoners by extinguishing the fire they started.
*   **C: Emaphoyisa (Police):** The text says police entered the yard and used tear gas to control the prisoners – a direct engagement.
*   **D: Tisebenti tasesibhedlela (Hospital staff):** Hospital staff treated the injured, but the text doesn't say they attempted to communicate with the remaining prisoners at the prison.



"
Ngukuphi kwalokulandzelako lokubangekutsi tiboshwa tihlehle kulesiphitsiphitsi?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngumlilo** (The fire).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Emkhatsini wa-10:00-11:00 ntsambama MDT, umlilo wacalwa tiboshwa ebaleni."" (Between 10:00-11:00 PM MDT, a fire was started by inmates in the yard.)  This directly indicates the fire as the cause of the unrest and the reason for the situation escalating, requiring police intervention with tear gas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tingcoco letiyimphumelelo** (Successful negotiations): The passage states negotiators were *trying* to resolve the situation, but the inmates were unresponsive.
*   **B: Lisisi lelikhalisa tinyembeti** (A tearful confession):  There's no mention of any confessions in the text.
*   **C: Tiboshwa letilimele** (Injured inmates): While injured inmates are mentioned at the beginning, they aren't the *cause* of the chaos, but rather a preceding event.



"
"Ngekwembono wa-Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, yini lekufanele live lase-Iran litikhulule kuko?","The correct answer is **D: Kuncika emafutseni (Dependence on oil)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Utse lelive kumelwe litikhulule kulenkhinga"" (He said the country must liberate itself from this problem).  The context of this statement is directly after he calls relying on oil ""a problem since the Islamic Revolution in 1979"". He wants Iran to move beyond being so heavily dependent on oil revenue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Imikhawulo yetetimali (Financial sanctions)** - While sanctions are mentioned, Khamenei's statement is about the *reliance on oil* itself, not just the sanctions causing problems.
*   **B: Ingucuko yema-Islamic (Islamic Revolution)** - He references the revolution as a point in time, not as something to be liberated from.
*   **C: Imali yangaphandle lengenako (Lack of foreign currency)** - This is a *result* of the oil situation, not the core problem he's addressing.



"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, ngubani lowavumela emnotweni wase-Iran?","The correct answer is **A: Imitfombo lesetulu** (Oil companies).

The passage states: ""kwenteka kumabonakudze, bekukwekucala kutsi babiki labadzaka be-Iran bavume kutsi letigwebo tiyasebenta."" This translates to: ""For the first time, Iranian oil companies admitted that the sanctions were working.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I-OPEC** – OPEC discussed oil production levels, but didn't *admit* sanctions were working.
* **C: Ngu-Ayatollah Ali Khamenei** – He spoke *about* the importance of oil and the problem of sanctions, but didn’t admit the sanctions were effective.
* **D: Inyonyana yase-Europe** – The passage mentions the European Union issuing a sanction, but not admitting it was working.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungasiyo incenye yenchubo yekuvota kwaseFrance?,"The correct answer is **D: Emavoti abalwa ngulabamele lukhetfo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kusihlwa, emavoti abalwa ngemavolontiya lagadvwe ngekucophelela, alandzelela ticondziso letitsite."" (In the evening, votes are counted by carefully selected volunteers, following strict instructions). This directly contradicts option D, which states the votes are counted by election representatives.

Let's look at why the other options *are* part of the French voting process:

*   **A: Emabhokisi ekuvota lasobala** - The passage states: ""Kusukela nga-1988, emabhokisi ekufaka timvilophi tekuvota bekubonakala lokungekhatsi kuwo kuze kutsi kungabi nemvilophi lefakwa kusengakacali kuvota nekutsi kute timvilophi letengetwako..."" (Since 1988, ballot boxes have been transparent so that no ballot is cast before voting begins and there are no ballots added except those cast by voters...)
*   **B: Bameli labatfunyelwe ngulababekwe esikhundleni** - The passage states: ""Tihambeli tingatfumela bameli kute batoba bofakazi kulo lonkhe loluhlelo"" (Observers can send representatives to witness the entire process).
*   **C: Kusayina Ehlwini lekuvota** - The passage states: ""...labavotile bafaka timvilophi emabhokisini ekuvota bese basayina ephepheni lekuvota."" (…voters put the ballots in the ballot boxes and then sign the voting register.)



"
Bantfu labavotako babakhombisa kuphi bantfu lababakhetsile?,"The correct answer is **C: Emvilopheni** (In the envelope).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...bafake liphepha leliprintiwe lelishoko kutsi bavotela bani **emvilophini**."" ( ...they put a printed paper stating who they are voting for **in the envelope**.)

This directly indicates that voters show who they have chosen by placing the paper with their choice *inside the envelope*.



"
Yini leyaholela Allen kutsi acele kutfungatsa ema-Musashi iminyaka lesiphohlongo?,"The correct answer is **C: Kutjala kwakhe imali ekuhloleni elwandle**.

Here's why:

The passage states Allen *invested* his wealth in ocean exploration and *initiated* the search for the Musashi because of a lifelong passion for shipwrecks. While his wealth (A) enabled the search, it wasn't the *reason* he pursued it.  The passage doesn't mention anything about mapmaking (B) or a passion for war (D). 

Investing in ocean exploration and having a lifelong passion for shipwrecks were the driving forces behind his decades-long pursuit.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini lena Allen lasebentise kuyo imali yakhe leningi?","The correct answer is **B: Kuhlola lulwandle**.

The passage states: ""Allen kwabikwa kutsi umcebo wakhe lomningi wawu-investela **luhlolo lwetelwandle** futsi wacala umtamo wekutfola i-Musashi ngenca yesifiso semphilo yonkhe setemphi."" 

While retrieving the Musashi is the *result* of his investment, the passage specifically says he invested in ocean exploration.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungenteka kuholele etimeni letiyingoti phakatsi nasedvute kwesitjalo?","The correct answer is **A: Emafutsa e-Uranium**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that authorities suspect the white smoke indicates a leak in the **oil (efutsa)** used to cool the **uranium (Uranium)**. They believe the leak is vaporizing and being released into the air.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: I-caesiumlenemisebe:** Caesium and radiation are mentioned as being *detected*, but not as the *cause* of the smoke.
*   **C: Intutfu lemhlophe:** The white smoke is a *symptom* of the problem, not the problem itself.
*   **D: i-lodine:** Iodine is also detected, but similarly to caesium, it's a consequence, not the source of the issue.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungasiyo lenye yemathiphu ekuphepha laphakamiswe kubahlali bendzawo kulandzela sigameko lesenteke kulesikhungo?,"The correct answer is **C: Gwema kuhogela intutfu lemhlophe** (Avoid inhaling the white smoke).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Labasemagunyeni bacwayisa bahlali labadvutane nalendzawo kutsi bahlale etindlini, bacime ema-air-conditions futsi banganatsi emanti asepompini."" (Authorities advised residents to stay indoors, turn off air conditioners, and not draw water from the well).

Let's break down why the other options *are* advice given in the passage:

* **A: Gwema kusebentisa emayunithi emoya** (Avoid using air conditioning) – Directly stated in the passage.
* **B: Hlala phakatsi** (Stay indoors) – Directly stated in the passage.
* **D: Gwema kunatsa emanti empompini** (Avoid drawing water from the well) – Directly stated in the passage.

The passage does not mention anything about avoiding inhaling white smoke.  It only mentions the *presence* of white smoke, linking it to a potential leak.  Therefore, avoiding inhaling it is a logical safety precaution, but it wasn't explicitly stated as advice given to the residents in the provided text.



"
"Ngekwa Dtk. Moll, yini lekhatsata kakhulu mayelana ne-XDR-TB?","The correct answer is **D: Lizinga lekufa lelisetulu** (The high mortality rate).

Here's why:

The text states Dr. Moll describes the new strain as ""a bigger problem and more worrying because of the high number of people it kills."" This directly points to the high mortality rate being the biggest concern.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lokuhlukile kuba yikontileka esibhedlela** (The fact that it is contracted in hospitals) - While Dr. Moll suspects hospital transmission, this isn't presented as the *most* worrying aspect.
*   **B: Umehluko wekumelana netidzakamiva** (The difference in drug resistance) - The text states it *is* XDR-TB (Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis), implying resistance is known, but doesn't highlight this as the primary concern.
*   **C: Linani lebantfu labangandluliselwa ngumuntfu logulako** (The number of people one sick person can infect) - While the text mentions infectivity (10-15 people per year), it doesn't say this is the *most* concerning factor.



"
Tingaki tigulane letitfole ikontileka lesha leticinisekisiwe kutsi titisebenti tetemphilo?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The passage states: ""Dkt. Moll ucabanga kutsi letinye tiguli tisitfole esibhedlela lesifo, lokungenani lababili bekutisebenti tasesibhedlela."" This translates to ""Dr. Moll thinks that some patients contracted the disease in the hospital, at least two of whom were healthcare workers."" 

Therefore, the answer is 2."
Hlobo muni webuchwephesha lolusebentiswa luhlelo lwe-NextGen?,"The correct answer is **A: Buchwepheshe lobusekelwe kusethelayithi**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Isebentisa **buchwephesha lobusisekelo besethelayithi** ngalokokwehlukile ebuchwephesheni bangesikhatsi lesendlulile..."" (It uses **satellite-based technology** unlike previous technology...). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Buchwepheshe bekunemba** - While accuracy is *a result* of the technology, it isn't *what* the technology *is*.
* **C: Buchwepheshe lobusekelwe phasi ku-rada** - The passage specifically contrasts NextGen with *older* technology, implying it isn't radar-based.
* **D: Buchwepheshe bekukhishwa kwekhabhoni** - This describes the *benefit* of the system, not the technology itself.



"
Ingabe i-NextGen ibazuzisa njani balawuli bekuphitsitela kwetindiza?,"The correct answer is **B: Indzawo yendiza lenembe kakhudlwana**.

Here's why:

The passage states that NextGen uses advanced technology to allow air traffic control to ""condzise tindiza"" (optimize flights) and provide pilots with ""umniningwane loliciniso"" (accurate information).  This directly translates to more precise flight paths and therefore, more accurate positioning of aircraft.

Let's look at why the other options are less directly supported by the text:

*   **A: Imizila yendiza lemifisha (Shorter flight paths):** While NextGen *results* in shorter flight paths, the passage doesn't say this is *how* it benefits controllers. It's a consequence of the improved accuracy.
*   **C: Kunciphisa kukhishwa kwekhabhoni (Reduced carbon emissions):** This is a benefit of NextGen, but not a direct way it helps controllers.
*   **D: Phethiloli lomncane (Less fuel):**  Again, a result of the system, not a direct benefit to controllers.

Therefore, the most direct benefit to air traffic controllers from the description in the passage is improved flight positioning accuracy."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini lengazange igcekwe tatimlandvo i-FBI ngekugcila kuyo?","The correct answer is **A: Kukhulisa lizinga lempumelelo yabo** (Increasing their success rate).

Here's why:

The passage states the FBI was using funds and resources *to* increase its success rate, specifically in cases like auto theft. It doesn't say they *failed* to do so, only that that was the *goal*.  The passage focuses on *how* they were trying to achieve this, by focusing on certain types of crimes and assigning personnel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kwaba tinsita ebugebengwini lobucatululeka lula** (Being involved in easily solvable crimes) - The text implies they were focusing on *solving* these crimes, not just being involved with them.
*   **C: Kugcila kakhulu etimeni tetitfombe letingcolile** (Focusing too much on violent crime) - The text states they were assigned 10 agents to *specific* violent crime areas, but doesn't indicate they focused *too* much.
*   **D: Emacala emoto leyebiwe** (Auto theft cases) - They *were* focusing on auto theft cases, so it wasn't something they didn’t address.



"
Sinyatselo semanyala siphocelela i-FBI kutsi yenteni?,"The correct answer is **B: Khulisa lizinga lempumelelo ye-ejensi** (Increase the success rate of the agency).

Here's why:

The text states the funding was given ""with the goal of increasing the agency's success rate."" While the text *also* mentions specific areas like auto theft and dedicating agents to certain crimes, these are *methods* to achieve the *goal* of increased success.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While investigating auto theft is mentioned, it's not the overarching *purpose* of the funding.
*   **C:** The funding isn't about focusing on easy-to-solve crimes; it's about improving overall success.
*   **D:**  Assigning agents to specific crimes is a tactic, but not the main aim of the funding.



"
Kwentekeni emotini yeticishamlilo lephendvule engotini ye-JAS 39C Grpen? ,"The correct answer is **B: Igicikile** (It overturned).

The text states: ""Imibiko yemaphephandzaba ibike ngemoto yemlilo legicikile ngesikhatsi iya endzaweni lokwenteke kuyo ingoti."" This translates to ""Newspaper reports reported an overturned fire truck on its way to the crash site.""
"
"Kulandzela kushayisa kwe-JAS 39C Gripen, siteshi setindiza besivalelwe ini?","The correct answer is **A: Tindiza tekutsengiselana** (Commercial flights).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...kwavalwa lesikhungo setindiza kundizela temsebenti"" which translates to ""...the airfield was closed to commercial flights.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Timoto temlilo** (Fire trucks) - The text mentions fire trucks *going to* the crash site, not that the airfield was closed because of them.
* **C: Imidiya yendzawo** (Local media) - Media coverage doesn't cause an airfield to close.
* **D: Behold Belicembu** - This doesn't make sense in the context of the passage.



"
Brzezinski unikete bani sicondziso ngesikhatsi sengucuko yase-Iran?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngu-Carter**.

The text states: ""Njenge-NSA, usite Carter ngekubamba tindzaba temave... i-Iranian Revolution, leyaletsa simo se-Iran sekutfumba, nga-1979."" This directly translates to: ""As NSA, he assisted Carter in handling foreign affairs... the Iranian Revolution, which led to the collapse of the situation in Iran, in 1979."" 

Therefore, Brzezinski advised *Carter* during the Iranian Revolution.



"
Ngubani lobambe sikhundla sekuba ngumeluleki wetekuphatsa Eveni lonkhe kwaze kwaba ngu-1977?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngu-Brzezinski**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Njenge-NSA, usite Carter ngekubamba tindzaba temave...kusuka nga-1977 kuya nga-1981, endlula Henry Kissinger."" This means Brzezinski held the position of National Security Advisor (NSA) starting in 1977, *succeeding* Kissinger. Therefore, before 1977, Kissinger held the position. The question asks who held the position *until* 1977, making Brzezinski the correct answer as he took over in that year.



"
Ngukuphi kulokuladzelako lokungakhombisi ngalokungiko umsebenti waBobek nePartizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **A: Ushaye emagoli langetulu kulangu-468 ngesikhatsi adlalela licembu**.

Here's why:

The passage states Bobek scored 403 goals in 468 games. Option A says he scored *more* than 468 goals. This directly contradicts the information in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: Ushaye emagoli lamaningi kunanoma ngumuphi lomunye umdlali** - The passage says ""Kute lomunye lowake wadlala imidlala leminingi futsi washayela lelicembu emagoli lamaningi kwendlula Bobek,"" which means no one scored more goals for Partizan than Bobek.
* **C: Wake wavotelwa njengemdlali lovelele emlandvweni welicembu** - The passage states ""Nga-1995 wavotelwa ngengemdlali lohamba phambili kuwo wonkhe umlandvo wemaPartizan.""
* **D: Ubonakale emidlalweni leminingi kunoma ngumuphi lomunye umdlali** - The passage states ""Kute lomunye lowake wadlala imidlala leminingi futsi washayela lelicembu emagoli lamaningi kwendlula Bobek,"" indicating he played more games than anyone else.



"
Ngusiphi sitatimende lesimayelanne nemlandvo wa-Bokek ne-Partizan Belgrade lesiliciniso?,"The correct answer is **A: Ucale kudlalela i-Partizan nga-1945**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Wabajoyina nga-1945 futsi wahlala kwaze kwaba ngu-1958."" (He joined them in 1945 and stayed until 1958.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage says he was *from* Zagreb, not that he played for the team there.
*   **C:** He finished playing for Partizan in 1958, not 1995. 1995 is the year he was voted the greatest player.
*   **D:** He gained fame *before* being voted the best player, not after. His fame came from his performance while playing for Partizan.



"
Ngekwendzima ngutiphi tici letihlukanisa iHesperonychus ku-Velociraptor?,"The correct answer is **A: Inetinyawo letimbili** (It has two claws).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Lenyoni legcwele tinsiba lenengati lefutfumele bekukholelwa kutsi yake yahamba yacondza ngetinyawo tayo letimbili nangetidladla njengeVelociraptor."" which translates to ""This fully feathered dinosaur with sickle claws was believed to walk hunting with its two feet and claws like Velociraptor.""  This highlights the two feet as a key characteristic.

The passage then states: ""Tidladla tayo tesibili tatitinkhulu, taniketwa ligama lelitsi Hesperonychus lelisho kutsi """"tidladla tasenshonalanga."""""" which translates to ""Its second claws are large, named Hesperonychus meaning """"western claws."""".  While the claws *are* mentioned, the fundamental difference being highlighted is the *number* of feet it uses for hunting, like the Velociraptor.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Eneluzipho lwesibili lolukhundlwana** (A smaller second toe) - The passage actually says the second claws are *large*.
*   **C: Inemtimba lonetinsiba ngalokugcwele** (A fully feathered body) - Both Hesperonychus and Velociraptor are described as being fully feathered.
*   **D: Kufutfumala ingati** (Sickle clawed) - Both have sickle claws, it's not a differentiating factor.



"
Inchazelo ye”Hesperonychus” iniketwa ngutiphi tici letibonakalako tetinhlobo tetilwane?,"The correct answer is **A: Luzipho(s)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Taniketwa ligama lelitsi Hesperonychus lelisho kutsi """"tidladla tasenshonalanga."""""", which translates to ""It was given the name Hesperonychus which means """"western claws."""""".  This directly links the name ""Hesperonychus"" to the animal's **claws** (luzipho).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Umtimba lonetinsiba** (A body with feathers) - While the text mentions feathers, it doesn't explain the name ""Hesperonychus"".
*   **C: Tinyawo** (Feet) - The text mentions it walked on two feet, but doesn't link that to the name.
*   **D: Umlomo** (Mouth) - The text does not mention the mouth in relation to the name.



"
Ngutiphi titatimende letilandzelako letiliciniso mayelana nekudubula?,"The correct answer is **D: Kudubula kwenteke eBuffalo**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states the husband was killed in a shooting in Buffalo: ""Umyeni loneminyaka lengu-30...waba ngulomunye kulabo labane lababulawe kulokudubulana, kodvwa umfati wakhe akazange alimale.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Indvodza nemfati bobabili babuya eTexas:** The text says the husband *moved* to Buffalo from Texas, not that they both came from Texas.
*   **B: Bekunebantfu labahlanu labahlukumetekile:** The text states four people were killed, not five affected in total.
*   **C: Lalababili bashade ngemnyaka lodlulile eBuffalo:** They were married last year, but the text specifically states they were married in Texas: ""Lombhancwane boshade e-Texas emnyakeni lophelile."""
Ngusiphi sitatimende lekungiso lesimayelana nendzawo lapho kwenteke khona sigameko sekudubulana?,"The correct answer is **A: Kwenteke emcimbini wekugubha iminyaka eBuffalo**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Lombhancwane boshade e-Texas emnyakeni lophelile wabese uta e-Buffalo kutojabula nebangani netihlobo."" and later, ""Umyeni loneminyaka lengu-30...waba ngulomunye kulabo labane lababulawe kulokudubulana.""  This clearly indicates the shooting happened in Buffalo, where he was celebrating with friends and family.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kwenteke emcimbini losemtsetfweni wekugubha lusuku** - The text doesn't mention a street event or a day celebration.
*   **C: Kwenteke emcimbini e-Texas** - He *got married* in Texas, but the shooting happened in Buffalo.
*   **D: Kwenteke emshadweni webashadikati** - The text says they were celebrating their *first anniversary*, not getting married again.



"
Ngekusho kwendzima bekuyini kukhtsateka kwekucala phakatsi kwetikhulu mayelana ne-Luno?,"The correct answer is **A: Kusweleka kwemtfwalo wamanyolo** (Loss of cargo).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...baphatsi bacala kukhatsateka kutsi lomkhumbi ungase uwuchitse lomthwalo."" This translates to ""...the managers started to worry that the ship might lose its cargo.""  The worry is directly about the potential loss of the cargo being transported by the ship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Emagagasi nemoya lomkhulu** (Waves and strong winds) - While these are mentioned, they are the *cause* of the potential problem, not the worry itself.
* **C: Kucitseka kwemafutsa** (Spilling of oil) -  The passage mentions oil (""aphethiloli"") spilling, but the managers' worry is about the cargo, not the oil.
* **D: Kulimela lokungenteka kumalunga etisebenti** (Injury to crew members) - The passage mentions crew injuries from the plane crash, but this is a separate incident and not the worry related to the ship and Luno.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngutiphi kuletitatimende letilandzelako letingasilo liciniso mayelana nekuphuka kwe-Luno?","The correct answer is **B: Umkhumbi bowunemafutsa langemamitha langu-100 ngesikhatsi sekuphuka.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Umkhumbi longemamitha langu-100 bewusendleleni uyotsatsa umtfwalo wemcuba..."" (The ship of 100 meters was on its way to deliver a load of coal...).  It doesn't say it *had* coal on board *when* it broke. It was *going* to load coal.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

* **A: Kuphuka kwenteke ngaphambi kwekutsatsa imphahla** (The break happened before loading goods): The passage implies this – the ship was *on the way* to load, but the break happened *before* it completed that task.
* **C: Kwetisebenti letilishumi nakubili, kwalimala munye** (Of the twelve workers, one was injured):  ""...indiza lenaphephela emhlane isindzise bantfu labalishumi nakubili labasebenta ndzawonye lolimele umane nje waphuka imphumulo"" (the helicopter rescued eighteen workers who were working together, only one was injured).
* **D: Umkhumbi waphoswa emantini lageletako** (The ship was pushed to the shore): ""...umoya lomkhulu nemagagasi kwayiphushela emantini."" (the strong wind and waves pushed it to the shore).



"
Kuiphi lishumi leminyaka lapho i-Algeria yatfola khona imphumelelo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngo-1960s**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngabo-1960 wabuyela emuva e-Algeria eveni lebeselitfole imvume yekutibusa...""  This translates to ""In the 1960s he returned to Algeria after it had already gained its independence..."" 

Therefore, Algeria achieved independence (success in gaining self-governance) in the 1960s.



"
Betikuphi tikilini tamabonakudze tingakalungiseleli umcimbi wemngcwabo?,"The correct answer is **A: Kulo lonkhe laseRome**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bomabonakudze labanyenti labakhulu bafakiwe **etindzaweni letinyenti taseRoma** kuze bantfu babukele lombutsano.""  This directly translates to ""Many screens were set up in **many places in Rome** so people could watch the funeral.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Emadolobheni lahlukene ase-Italy** - While the text mentions similar events in other Italian cities, it specifically states the screens were in *many places in Rome*.
*   **C: Etindzaweni letitsite ePoland** - Poland is mentioned as a place *watching* the funeral, not where screens were set up.
*   **D: E-St. Peter Square** - The text states the square was too full to accommodate everyone, which is why screens were set up *elsewhere*.



"
Wentelwe kuphi umcimbi wemgcwabo?,"The correct answer is **C: E-St. Peter Square**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...bekungeke kwenteke kutsi wonkhe umuntfu akhone kungena kulomngcwabo eSt. Peter's Square."" This directly identifies St. Peter's Square as the location of the funeral. While people *gathered* in many places to *watch* the funeral, the funeral itself took place at St. Peter's Square.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Etindzaweni letihlukene kulo lonkhe laseRome** - This is too broad. People gathered in many places *to view* the funeral, but it wasn't held in multiple locations simultaneously.
*   **B: E-Poland** - Poland held similar events to *watch* the funeral, but it wasn't the location of the funeral itself.
*   **D: Kwekucala eRome, kubese kuba kulelinye lidolobha lase-Italy** - The passage doesn't suggest the funeral moved to another city."
"Kulandzela kuchuma, ngubani lowalashelwa kulimala lokubi?","The correct answer is **A: Lokungenani bantfu labasihlanu** (At least five people).

The text states: ""bantfu labasihlanu labebakulendzawo ngesikhatsi salokuchuma balashelwa kwetfuka."" This directly translates to ""five people who were in the house at the time of the explosion were taken to the hospital with injuries."" 

Therefore, at least five people were injured.



"
Ngubani lobike?,"The correct answer is **A: Makhelwane esakhuweni** (Neighbors in the area).

The text states: ""...makhelwane ashaye lucingo wabika ngekuvuta kwagesi."" which translates to ""...neighbors called reporting an electrical fault.""
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, bangaki bantfu labashone kulokuhlasela?","The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The text states ""Labashonile bekunguNicholas Alden, 25, naZachary Cuddeback, 21."" This directly states that two people died in the attack. 

While Kristoffer Schneider was severely injured, the text says he *needed* surgery and doesn't state he died. The mention of the fifth person and the failed attempt to shoot them doesn't indicate a fatality."
Sabani sikhali lesihluleke kudubula ngesikhatsi lesitsite ngesikhatsi sekuhlasela?,"The correct answer is **B: Sa-Uka**.

The text states: ""Sikhali sa-Uka sahluleka sibe sikhonjwe enhloko yendvodza yesihlanu."" (The Uka's weapon failed to be aimed at the head of the fifth man.) This directly indicates the weapon that malfunctioned was Uka's."
Ngiyiphi yalemidlalo lelandzelako leyavotelwa kutsi isuswe ehlelweni lema-Olympic?,"The correct answer is **C: I-Baseball**.

The text states: ""I-baseball ne-softball, lekwavotelwa kutsi kuphume Emidlalweni yema-Olimpiki nga-2005.""  (Baseball and softball, which were voted out of the Olympic Games in 2005.)
"
Nguyiphi Yalemidlalo ldlandzelako levotelwe likomiti lavelonkhe kutsi liwufake kulemidlalo?,"The correct answer is **C: Inyonyane Yebhola lembhoco** (Rugby sevens).

The text specifically states: ""rugby, ngalokukhetsekile inyonyane ye-rugby, negalufa yakhetfwa kunaleminye imidlalo lesihlanu lebeyibalelwe kudlalwa kuma-Olimpiki."" This means rugby sevens was voted to be included.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I-Rollersports** - The text mentions ""imidlalo yekugicika"" which *includes* rollersports, but doesn't say it was specifically voted in.
*   **B: I-Baseball** - The text states baseball and softball were *removed* from the Olympics in 2005.
*   **D: Ibhola letsambile** - (Football/Soccer) is not mentioned in the text as being considered for inclusion.



"
Arthur Guinness ekucaleni wacashisa iSt James’ Gate iminyaka lemingaki?,"The correct answer is **D: 9000**.

The text states Arthur Guinness signed a lease for 9,000 years to use St James' Gate Brewery. The other options are incorrect:

* **A: 250** - This is the number of years *after* the initial lease.
* **B: 10** - This number doesn't appear in the text.
* **C: 1759** - This is the year the lease was signed, not the length of the lease."
Mayelana netigidzi letiyinkhulungwane temadola letiletfwa nguGuinness ngemnyaka ngamunye?,"The correct answer is **D: 10**.

The text states Guinness generates ""over 10 billion euros (US$14.7 billion) each year."" The question asks about the billions of *dollars*, and the text provides the equivalent in dollars as $14.7 billion, which is ""over 10 billion"" (rounded down). Therefore, 10 is the closest and correct answer."
Mangaki emave e-European Union lakhonjiwe laneligciwane i-H5N1?,"The correct answer is **C: Sikhombisa**.

The text states: ""Live laseFrance lesikhombisa emaveni aseYurophu Lehlangene kutsi lihlaselwe nguleligciwane..."" which translates to ""Seven European Union countries have shown to be infected with the virus...""
"
Likhonjwe kuphi licala lakamuva leligciwane i-H5N1?,"The correct answer is **A: I-France**.

The text states: ""...i-H5N1, kucinisekisiwe kutsi sibulale lidada lasesigangeni, lelitfolakale ngeMsombuluko emachaphozini lasedvute kwe-Lyon empumalanga yase-France."" This clearly indicates the latest case is in France.



"
Wagcina nini Haiti kuba nalesifo ngaphambi kwekusakateka lokubangwa masotja ekuthula?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngabo 1800**.

The text states: ""Ngaphambi kwekutsi emabutfo emphi efike, iHaiti beyingakake yahlangabetana netinkinga letihlobene netifo kusukela nga-1800."" This translates to ""Before the peacekeeping forces arrived, Haiti had not faced problems related to disease since 1800.""
"
Tibi letisuka kuyiphi indzawo letinemtselela ekubhebhetsekeni kwalesifo?,"The correct answer is **B: Enkambu i-UN**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""imfucuta lesuka enkambu ye-UN yayingakahlantisiswa kahle, lokwabangela kutsi emagciwane angene emseleni wemanti loya Emfuleni i-Artibonite..."" This directly links the UN camp as the *source* of the contamination that led to the cholera outbreak.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Emfuleni i-Artibonite** - The river *received* the contamination, it wasn't the source.
*   **C: Endzaweni yekutamatama kwemhlaba ngo-2010** - The earthquake created conditions that may have worsened the situation, but it didn't directly cause the cholera.
*   **D: Sikhungo se-Haiti Sebulungiswa Nentsandvo Yelinyenti.** - This is an organization investigating the issue, not the source of the cholera.

Uhlele kwentani hulumende wase-Irish?,"The correct answer is **C: Kunetseteka imitsetfo mayelana nekuvunyelwa kwetidzakamiva** (Ensuring regulations regarding the approval of medicines).

Here's why:

The passage states the Irish government emphasizes the importance of *putting a framework in place* to correct the situation. They want to ensure medicine is used quickly and safely. The Minister of Health expressed concern about both public health *and* the breakdown of regulations concerning medicine approval.  This points to the government trying to **ensure regulations** are followed and effective.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tigwebo letiniketwa labaphula umtsetfo wetidzakamiva** (Punishments for those who break drug laws) - The passage doesn't focus on punishment, but on *preventing* issues with medicine approval.
* **B: Kwethula imitsetfo lecinile mayelana nekuvunyelwa kwetidzakamiva** (Introducing strict regulations regarding medicine approval) -  The passage implies regulations *already exist* but have failed; the government is trying to *fix* the existing system.
* **D: Kubandlulula tidzakamiva** (Smuggling drugs) - This isn't mentioned at all in the passage.



"
Yini lebeyisemtsetfweni kwesikhashana e-Ireland?,"The correct answer is **D: Tidzakamiva** (Drugs).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...nemacala lamayelana netidzakamiva lakehlile solo lolushintjo nyalo-lolungekho emtsetfweni lucalisile."" This translates to ""...and cases related to drugs have declined sharply now - no longer on the street are visible.""  This clearly indicates that drugs were temporarily present on the streets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kugcekeza** (Violence) - The text doesn't mention violence being on the streets.
*   **B: Inkhohliso** (Deception) - There's no mention of deception.
*   **C: Kuhlasela** (Attacks) - The text doesn't discuss attacks.



"
Uphenyelwa ini umsolwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Kucekela phasi imphahla**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...utse lomboshwa wesilisa uyaphenywa ngelicala lekungena endzaweni lakangakavunyelwa kuyo kunelokulimata imphahla.""

This translates to: ""...that the male suspect is being investigated for the crime of entering a prohibited area with the intention of stealing property.""

""Kucekela phasi imphahla"" means ""stealing property"" or ""theft"". The other options don't relate to the described crime.



"
"Uma ushintja luphawu, yini langakayenti umsolwa?","The correct answer is **A: Kushintja yinye yetinhlavu tayo**.

Here's why:

The passage states the signature was altered by changing an ""O"" to a small ""e"". This is a change to a letter (a glyph/symbol). Therefore, changing *any* of the letters/symbols would be what the suspect *didn't* do – they specifically changed one letter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kuyihlobisa ngeluphawu lekuthula** - The passage says the signature was *decorated* with peace and heart signs, not altered *by* them.
* **C: Ilimate ngekwemtimba** - The passage mentions trespassing to *steal property*, not physical assault.
* **D: Sebentisa liseyili kuyilungisa** - The passage states the alteration *was* done using black ink.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzdlako lobekumfundzisi wesingisi Karno langasolwa ngako?","The correct answer is **D: Kusebentisa lulimi lolungcolile ekilasini** (Using vulgar language in class).

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states: ""futsi kubikwa kutsi usebentise inkhulumo lengcolile ekilasini"" which translates to ""and it is reported that he used vulgar language in class.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuphulwa kwe-copyright (Copyright infringement):** While he *was* previously accused of this, the passage states he was never penalized. It’s a past accusation, not a current one.
* **B: Kutsandzana nemfundzi (Flirting with students):** The passage mentions him writing notes teaching others ""skills of seduction,"" and being friends with students, but doesn't directly accuse him of *flirting*. It’s more about inappropriate content and relationships.
* **C: Kuphrinta tikhangiso letingakagunyatwa (Printing unauthorized advertisements):** Modern Education accuses him of this, but the main focus of the accusations isn't the printing itself, but the false claim of being a “leading English teacher” in the ads.



Therefore, the most direct and explicitly stated accusation against Karno in the passage is the use of vulgar language in class."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubani longakathunjwa nguRonald Mendoza?","The correct answer is **A: Tihambi letibuka indzawo** (Tourists).

The passage states: ""Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists."" This directly identifies the tourists as the people he shot at.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Liphoyisa** (Police officer) - He *was* a police officer, but not who he shot at.
*   **C: Bantfwana** (Children) - While children were among the hostages, the passage doesn't say he specifically targeted them.
*   **D: Batfwebuli** (Photographers) - They were taking photos of the situation as it unfolded, but weren't the targets of the shooting.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubaphi labathunjiwe labangakacinisekiswa kutsi bakhululwe ngaphambi kwesikhatsi?","The correct answer is **D: Labantfwana**.

The passage specifically states: ""Bantfu labasitfupha labebatfunjiwe lokufaka ekhatsi bantfwana nebantfu labadzala, bakhululiwe, njengoba bebabatsebuli betitfombe beFilipino."" This translates to: ""The younger hostages including children and adults were released, as they were Filipino citizens."" 

Therefore, the children were confirmed to be released before others.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubani lococa imisayino kute asekele kushada ngebulili lobufanako eBrasil?","The correct answer is **A: Bafaki tikhalo** (Protestors).

Here's why:

The text states that protestors are hoping to collect 1.2 million signatures to present to the Supreme Federal Court in November *in support of* same-sex marriage. This indicates they are the ones actively advocating for it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngu-Roberto Jefferson:** Roberto Jefferson is mentioned as currently holding the draft bill, not as someone advocating for same-sex marriage.
* **C: Lisontfo lemaRoma iCatholic:** The text explicitly states the Catholic Church *opposes* same-sex marriage.
* **D: Marta Siplicy:** Marta Suplicy wrote the initial draft but the text doesn't portray her as currently leading the charge for approval.



"
Babhikishi batasiniketa bani sicelo sabo?,"The correct answer is **A: Lisontfo lemaRoma iCatholic**.

Here's why:

The text states the protests are in response to the Catholic Church's opposition to same-sex marriage. The protesters are hoping to deliver a petition to the Vatican (Engcungcutseleni Yelive Lonkhe which translates to Vatican) to address this issue. Therefore, their petition is directed towards the Catholic Church.



"
"Ngekusho kwa-Armand Versace, yini leyenteka ngaphambi kwekutsi sicuku sicale kusabela esimeni selitulu?","The correct answer is **A: Lacala laduma**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ngemizuzu nje lesihlanu, **kucale kuhhusha**..."" which translates to ""Just five minutes ago, **it started to thunder**..."". This directly precedes the description of the storm's intensification.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Siboniso besigijima ngemuva kwemizuzu lemihlanu** - The text mentions wind speed, not someone running.
*   **C: Kwaba nemoya lonemandla** - While there *was* strong wind, the thunder came *before* the wind was fully felt (""ngemuva kwemzuzu lowodvwa, lomoya bowugijima..."").
*   **D: Ulahlekelwe umkhondo welilunga lemndeni** - This refers to him losing his wife and friend *during* the storm, not before it began.



"
"Ngekusho kwaVersace, ucale nini umoya lonemandla?","The correct answer is **A: Imizuzu lembalwa ngemuva kwekutsi sicale siboni**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ngemizuzu nje lesihlanu, kucale kuhhusha, cishe ngemuva kwemzuzu lowodvwa, lomoya bowugijima ngesivinini lesingu 70km/h..."" This directly translates to ""Just five minutes ago, it started to drizzle, almost after one minute, the wind started blowing at a speed of 70km/h...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ngemuva kwemvula** - The text says it *started to drizzle* *before* the strong wind, not after a full rain.
*   **C: Ngemuva kwekulahlekelwa ngudzadze wabo** - The loss of his brother is mentioned, but it doesn't cause the wind. It's a separate event happening concurrently.
*   **D: Ngaphambi kwesichotho** - While the situation is chaotic, the text doesn't say the wind started *before* any damage occurred. It describes the wind *causing* the chaos.



"
"Ngaphambi kwaFred, tingaki tivunguvungu letikhulu letirekhodiwe eMpumalanga ya-35°?","The correct answer is **B: Kutsatfu** (Three).

The text states: ""...futsi sisiphepho sesitsatfu lesikhulu lesike sabikwa emphumalanga lesingu-35°W.""  This translates to ""...and is the third major hurricane to be reported east of 35°W.""
"
"Lapho Fred asedvute nsichingi saseCape Verde, bekacondze ngakuphi?","The correct answer is **A: Enshonalanga**.

The text states: ""Siphepho, lebesisendzaweni lechele ngemamayela langaba ngu-645 (1040 km) **enshonalanga** yesichingi saseCape Verde..."" (The storm was located about 645 miles (1040 km) **west** of the Cape Verde islands...). 

Therefore, when Fred passed the Cape Verde islands, it was to the west of them.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokunesivinini lesisheshako kunetindvuleli tayo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngu-802.11n**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that 802.11n is *greater* than 600Mbit/s. The other options (802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g) are all older standards and have lower maximum speeds than 802.11n.  The passage highlights that 802.11n is faster."
Yini ledzingekako kute i-802.11n ibuyele emuva ihambisane ne-802.11b?,"The correct answer is **A: Sivinini lesishesheko kakhulu**.

Here's why:

The passage states 802.11n can operate with 802.11b, but 802.11n is much *faster* (over 600Mbit/s) than 802.11b. To be compatible with the slower 802.11b standard, the 802.11n network must **reduce its speed** to match the slower standard. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Likhono le-802.11b lekusebenta ku-5.0Ghz:** 802.11b operates on the 2.4GHz frequency, not 5.0GHz.
* **C: Kuphuma kwe-600Mbit/s:**  While 600Mbit/s is mentioned as the *speed of* 802.11n, it's not what's needed to fall back to 802.11b.
* **D: Umsakato lokabili:**  Dual-band capability (2.4GHz and 5.0GHz) helps 802.11n with broader compatibility, but doesn't enable it to work *with* slower standards like 802.11b.



"
Mingaki imicimbi lapho umhlomuli wendondi yegolide wema-Olympics lobekumele abhukute kuyo imidlalo yemphakatsi?,"The correct answer is **A: Kuhlanu**.

Here's why:

The text states the athlete was supposed to compete in:

*   100m freestyle
*   200m freestyle
*   Three relays

That makes a total of 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 events."
Kungani lowazuza imedali  yeligolide kuma-Olympics angazange anatse umutsi wetinhlungu takhe?,"The correct answer is **C: Bekakhatsatekile kutsi kutawuphatamisa kulungela kwakhe**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ngenca yekungaphili kakhle kuyangabateka kutsi uwulungele lomcudzelwano."" (because of not feeling well, it's feared he won't be ready for the competition) and ""...angakhoni kunatsa emaphilisi ladzingekile kuze acedze lobuhlungu lanabo njengoba angakavunyelwa kuLomdlalo."" (he can't take the necessary pills to finish the pain because he isn't allowed to compete in the Games).

This shows he was worried about how taking pain medication would affect his performance.  He wasn't *unable* to manage the pain, but concerned about the consequences of doing so.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Akakabi nebuhlungu** (He has no pain) - The passage clearly states he *has* pain.
* **B: kumente wativa agula** (It made him feel sick) - The passage says he's not feeling well, but doesn't say it made him sick. The issue is the pain itself and how to manage it.
* **D: Akukavunyelwa kuma-Commonwealth Games** (He wasn't allowed in the Commonwealth Games) - This is a result of his condition, not the reason he didn't take the pain medication.



"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, ingabe yini leyaholela ekudzidzekeni mayelana nesehlakalo sekutamatama kwemhlaba?","The correct answer is **C: Libalave lavelonkhe lekutamatama kwemhlaba**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lucwaningo Lwendzawo Lwase Melika lukhombisa kutsi emephini yemhlaba yekutamatama kwemhlaba kute kutamatama kwemhlaba lokwenteke e-Iceland kuleliviki lelegcile."" (American geological research showed a connection between the global earthquake pattern and the earthquake in Iceland last week). This means broader earthquake data led to the awareness of the event in Iceland.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuba khona kwemafu lamnyama** - The dark clouds are a *result* of possible volcanic activity and cause *uncertainty* about an eruption, they didn't *lead* to the discovery of the earthquake.
*   **B: Imibiko lebuya e-Icelandic Meteorological Office** - The Icelandic office hasn't reported anything in the last 48 hours, so they didn't initiate awareness.
*   **D: Tehlakalo letibikwe kuletinye tindzawo tase-Iceland.** - The passage mentions an earlier event (March 10th), but the current awareness comes from the *connection* to global patterns, not just local events.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kuvela nini kugucuka kwesigaba?","The correct answer is **C: Ngeti 10 Indlovulenkhulu (On March 10)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lokutamatama kwemhlaba lokuphumele emonakalweni kwenteka nga-March 10..."" which translates to ""The earthquake that caused damage occurred on March 10..."".

Therefore, the volcanic activity (the source of the disturbance) started on March 10th.
"
Ngutiphi titatimende letilandzelako mayelana neluphenyo le-Chandrayaan-1’s letingasilo liciniso?,"The correct answer is **D: Luphenyo belupentiwe ehlongotsini**.

Here's why:

The passage states the probe carried a ""picture of the Indian flag,"" not that the *probe itself* was painted. The other options are directly supported by the text:

*   **A: I-orbiter letfula luphenyo beyinetisebenti** - The passage describes the orbiter deploying the probe, indicating it was operational.
*   **B: Luphenyo belucuketfwe emathulusi labalulekile** - The passage states it carried ""three important scientific instruments.""
*   **C: Umjovo weluphenyo ube yimpumelelo** - It successfully crashed near the Moon's south pole, demonstrating a successful mission.



"
Ngutiphi titatimende letilandzelako letichaza ngalokungiko luphenyo lwenyanga?,"The correct answer is **C: Yakhishwa ku-orbiter lenebentfu**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""I-lunar orbiter lengatiwe iChandrayaan-1 ikhiphe iMoon Impact Probe (MIP)..."" which translates to ""The Chandrayaan-1 lunar orbiter *released* the Moon Impact Probe (MIP)...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yehla dvutane nesigcobo Enyakatho yeNyanga** (Fell near the North Pole of the Moon): The passage says it landed near the *south* pole, not the north pole.
* **B: Kushayiseka kwekufika kube imphumelelo** (The landing was a success): While it *was* a successful impact, this doesn't describe how it was deployed. The passage focuses on the release from the orbiter.
* **D: Beyitfwele emathulusi lamabili labalulekile** (It carried two important tools): The passage mentions *three* scientific instruments, not two. Also, focusing on the tools doesn't describe the deployment of the probe.



"
"Ngalokusekelwe endzimeni, ngusiphi silinganiso lesisebentiswa ekugcineni sekuvikela lesifo?","The correct answer is **D: Emakhethini etimbuzulwane** (Vaccines for ticks).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...kusakatwe tinkhulungwane tetintfo letikuvikela etimbuzulwaneni..."" which translates to ""...thousands of vaccines for ticks were distributed..."". This clearly indicates that vaccination against ticks is a measure taken to prevent the spread of the disease.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: SIbulala tinambutane** (We kill mosquitoes) - The text doesn't mention mosquitoes as carriers of the disease.
*   **B: Badobi betingulube** (Pig hunters) - While the text mentions culling pigs, the *purpose* is to control the disease spread, not simply hunting pigs. The core prevention method is the vaccine.
*   **C: Imitsi yekugomela i-Encephalitis** (Encephalitis medication) - The text mentions preparing for cases of encephalitis (a complication of the disease) by providing resources for healthcare workers, but medication *treats* the illness, not *prevents* it.



"
Sindlulela njani ebantfwini lesifo?,"The correct answer is **A: Timbuzulwane** (Ticks).

Here's why:

The text states: ""…kwenteka imbuzulwane iluma ingulube lenalesifo bese iyesuka iyoluma umuntfu uyawubese uyasitfola ke lesifo."" This directly translates to ""...if a tick bites a pig with the disease and then goes on to bite a person, that person will get the disease."" 

Therefore, ticks are the vector (carrier) that transmits the disease to humans.



"
Kuhluleka kwesigwebo sesibili kungaholela kumuphi umphumela?,"The correct answer is **B: Lilungelo lakusasa letinyonyane tebulili lobufanako**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kuhluleka kwalesigwebo sesibili, lesiphakamisa kumiswa kwetinyonyane temmango tebulili lobufanako, kungenta kutsi kuvunyelwe tinyonyane temmango ngekuhamba kwesikhatsi.""  This directly translates to: ""Failure of the second judgment, which proposes suspending same-sex marriage, would lead to same-sex marriage being allowed over time.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kubuyeketwa lokuphutfumako kwe-HJR-3** - While HJR-3 is mentioned, the *failure of the judgment* is what leads to the outcome, not a review of HJR-3's expiration.
*   **C: Sikhatsi lesiphutfumako semtsetfo** - The passage discusses the timeline of potential re-evaluation, but it's a consequence of the failure, not the failure itself.
*   **D: Kuvinjelwa kwetinyonyane tebulili lobufanako** - The opposite is true. Failure of the judgment *allows* same-sex marriage, it doesn't prevent it.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, sisuswe nini sigwebo sesibili?","The correct answer is **C: Ngemsombuluko** (On Monday).

The text states: ""...wendluliselwa ngendlela lefanako yi-Senate ngeMsombuluko."" (…was passed in the same way by the Senate on Monday.) This directly indicates when the second judgment was removed/passed.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngesikhatsi semtsetfo** (During the vote) - While related, it doesn't specify *when* it was removed, just that it happened during the process.
*   **B: Ngo-2011** (In 2011) - This is when the original houses were affected, not when the second judgment was removed.
*   **D: Ngo-2015** (In 2015) - This is when a review/amendment is planned, not when the judgment was removed.



"
Aputjutelwe kubani “emaphepha asePanama”?,"The correct answer is **B: Betindzaba** (News outlets/The media).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Emaphepha ePanama ligama lelisentjentiswa nakushiwo tincwadzi temtsetfo tasePanama Mossack Fonseca, letaphumela **kubetindzaba** ngentfwasahlobo yanga-2016."" 

This directly translates to: ""The Panama Papers is the name used when referring to the Panama Papers documents from Mossack Fonseca, which resulted in **news reports** in the spring of 2016.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Inkampani yase-Massachusetts Fonseca:** Mossack Fonseca is the *source* of the papers, not what they are named after.
*   **C: I-Deutsche Bank:** Deutsche Bank is mentioned as being heavily involved, but not what the papers are called.
*   **D: Baholi bahulumende base-Iceland:** Leaders were *affected* by the papers, but they don't define the papers themselves.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, Ngubani lowatse batindzaba baseBritish bekaphetse tinkampani letiningi letisebentiselwa kufihla Umcebo?","The correct answer is **C: I-Deutsche Bank**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Liphephandzaba laseBritish i-The Guirdian lisikisele kutsi Libhange leDeutsche lilawulwe cishe nguyinye kuletintsatfu tetinkapane teShell letingu 1200 letisentjentiselwe kwenta loku."" 

This translates to: ""The British newspaper The Guardian reported that Deutsche Bank controlled almost one of three of the 1200 shell companies used to do this.""

Therefore, the British newspaper reported Deutsche Bank was heavily involved with the shell companies used to hide wealth.



"
Ngutiphi tingoti tetindiza kuleti letilandzelako letife kakhulu?,"The correct answer is **A: Indiza iphahlateke endlelini iya e-Armenia isuka e-Iran**.

The text states: ""Kulenyanga lendlulile i-Iran ibe nengoti yendiza lembi kakhulu ngesikhatsi indiza lebeyiya e-Armenia iwa kufe bagibeli labangu-168."" This directly refers to a plane crash on a route from Iran to Armenia, resulting in 168 fatalities, making it the most significant plane crash mentioned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** While a police helicopter crashed, it only killed three people, making it less significant than the Armenia-bound plane crash.
*   **C:** The text describes a flight *from* Iran *to* Armenia, not the other way around.
*   **D:** The Mashhad incident, while tragic (18 deaths), is still less significant in terms of fatalities than the Armenia-bound flight crash.



"
Ngukuphi lokulandzelako lokungasiso sizatfu sebunyenti betingoti temoya letenteka e-Iran?,"The correct answer is **B: Kusweleka kwesabelomali lesivumela kutsengwa kwetindiza letisha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kumiswa kutsi kuyiwe emaveni langesheya kwetilwandle kwente kutsi tindiza letinsha tingatsengwa"" which translates to ""Funds were diverted from overseas accounts to prevent the purchase of new aircraft."" This directly indicates a lack of funding for new aircraft is a contributing factor to the air safety issues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Indiza lendzala yetindiza temphakatsi netetimpi** (Old military and police aircraft) - While old aircraft are likely *a result* of the problem, the passage doesn't present this as the *cause* of the increased crashes.
*   **C: Luswinyo loluvimbela kutsengwa kwetindiza letisha** (Sanctions preventing the purchase of new aircraft) - The passage discusses diverted funds, not sanctions specifically.
*   **D: Ingcogco yetindiza letinganakekelwa kahle** (Poor maintenance of well-maintained aircraft) - The passage doesn't mention maintenance issues.



"
Nguyiphi kuletilandzelako lengakafakwa embikweni weLicembu Lekufundza lase-Iraq?,"The correct answer is **C: Tincomo tekuvikela imincele ye-Iraq (Recommendations to protect Iraq's borders)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the report's first of 78 recommendations is to ""vikela emagede langena e-Iraq kubantfu labaneludlame"" (protect Iraq's borders from violent people).  This directly translates to recommendations for border security.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Kugcekwa kwenchubomgomo yamanje (Review of current policies):** While the report likely *contains* a review of current policies, the passage highlights the need for *change*, not just a review.
* **B: Simemetelo sekutsi ngetingucuko letitsite, ludlame lolukhulakho e-Iraq lungagwenywa (Assurance that through small reforms, large-scale violence in Iraq can be avoided):** The passage states the report calls for ""lushintjo loluphutfumako"" (radical change), not ""small reforms"".
* **D: Sicelo sekuvumelana kwe-US (Request for US agreement):** The passage says an agreement *was made* with the US, it doesn't mention a *request* for one in the report itself.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakaphisiswana ngako Licembu Lekufundza lase-Iraq embikweni wayo?,"The correct answer is **B: Lushintjo lwendlela lolusheshako**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Lombiko ufuna kutsi kube nelushintjo loluphutfumako"" which translates to ""The report calls for rapid policy change."" This directly matches option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kutsi kumemetelwe siciniseko sekumisa ludlame lolukhulako** - While the report mentions ending violence, it doesn't *guarantee* it will end. It calls for actions to help achieve that.
*   **C: Kusetjentiswa kwenkhulomomphikiswano levulekile** - The report *mentions* the need for open dialogue, but it isn't the main point of contention/debate presented.
*   **D: Kusungulwa kweluhlelo lolusha lemancusa** - This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
"Ngekusho kwemaphoyisa, ngubani lobekabonwa njengemuntfu longakwesekudla waseProvenzano?","The correct answer is **B: Ngu-Lo Piccolo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Emaphoyisa atsi Lo Piccolo abenesandla lesikhulu kuloku ngesizatfu sekutsi abesedvutane naProvenzano ePalermo futsi kuba nelwati kwakhe kwamenta wahlonishwa situkulwane lesidzala sebaphatsi.""  This directly translates to ""Police say Lo Piccolo had a significant hand in this because he allied with Provenzano in Palermo and his knowledge made him respected by the old guard of bosses.""

This clearly identifies Lo Piccolo as someone closely connected to and valued by Provenzano. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngu-Giovanni Falcone** and **D: Ngu-Paolo Borsellino** were victims of the Mafia, not supporters of Provenzano.
*   **C: Ngu-Ansa** is the source of the quote, not a person being identified as a Provenzano ally.



"
"Ngalokusekelwe kulolwati loluniketwe endzimeni, yini imbangela yekufa kwa-Falcone?","The correct answer is **A: Wabulawa empini lebeyichutjwa iRiina**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Riina embusweni leyabulala boMafia crusaders Giovanni Falcone naPaolo Borsellino nga-1992."" This directly translates to ""...Riina in the reign who killed Mafia crusaders Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992.""  It explicitly states Falcone was killed *by* the conflict instigated by Riina.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Wabulawa maphoyisa** - The passage does not suggest police were involved in Falcone's death.
* **C: Lo Piccolo wayalwa kutsi ambulale** - While Lo Piccolo is mentioned in connection to Mafia activities, the passage doesn't say he was ordered to kill Falcone.
* **D: Wabulawa nguPaolo Borsellino labekasebenta naye bu-Mafia** - This is incorrect. Borsellino was killed *alongside* Falcone, not by him.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungasi ngulenye yetindondo ta-Hitoshi Saito?,"The correct answer is **D: Chwepheshe weJudo** (Judo expert).

Here's why:

* **The passage states Hitoshi Saito was an Olympic and World champion.** This clearly indicates he was highly skilled and an expert in Judo.
* **A: Mphetsa wemhlaba emahlandla lamabili** (World Champion twice) - While true, the passage says he was a *World champion* (singular, not necessarily twice).
* **B: Sihlalo wekomiti le-All Japan Judo Federation** (Chairman of the All Japan Judo Federation) - This was a position he held *at the time of his death*, not an accomplishment *he was known for* throughout his career.
* **C: Lotfole indondo yegolide ye-Olympic emahlandla lamabili** (Won two Olympic gold medals) - This is stated in the passage, but it's *a result* of his skill, not the skill itself.  Being a champion *demonstrates* expertise, but isn't the expertise itself.



Therefore, being a Judo expert encompasses his overall skill and accomplishment."
Wakwati kuphi lwasaki kugwema kutsatsa tifungo?,"The correct answer is **A: E-Japan**.

Here's why:

The passage states Lwasaki was arrested in India (""waboshwa eNdiya""). The question asks where he *avoided* imprisonment. The passage doesn't mention anything about his experiences in Japan, implying he successfully avoided trouble there. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: E-Nepal:** He *ran away from* a wedding in Nepal, not avoided prison.
*   **C: E-India:** He was *arrested* in India.
*   **D: E-Tibet:** He was *attacked* by a dog in Tibet.



"
Ngubani lohlasele lwasaki?,"The correct answer is **C: Inja**.

The passage states: ""wahlaselwa yinja lenelulaka eTibet"" which translates to ""he was attacked by a fierce dog in Tibet"". 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Longahle abe mlingani wakhe wemshado** - This refers to someone who was going to be his wedding partner, not an attacker.
*   **B: Tigebengu** - The passage mentions he was arrested, but doesn't say he was attacked by criminals.
*   **D: Maphoyisa** - The passage states he was arrested *by* police, not attacked *by* them.



"
Wawucedza nini Alonso umncintiswano wakhe?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngaphambi kwekutsi Schumacher acedze umncintiswano wakhe**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Michael Schumacher ucedze umjaho wakhe kungasikudzala emuva kwa-Alonso..."" (Michael Schumacher finished his race shortly after Alonso...). This means Alonso finished *before* Schumacher.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngaphambi kwekutsi Schumacher alimate lisondvo lakhe laphambili** - The text mentions Schumacher having a food-related issue, but doesn't tie this directly to Alonso finishing the race.
*   **B: Fisichella wahluleka kulawula imoto yakhe** - This describes Fisichella's incident, not Alonso's race completion.
*   **D: Ngaphambi kwekuhola** - The text doesn't specify *when* relative to the finish Alonso completed his race.



"
Yini lebangele Schumacher kutsi asheshise kucedza umncintiswano wakhe?,"The correct answer is **D: Kulimala kwekumiswa kwemoto**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Michael Schumacher ucedze umjaho wakhe kungasikudzala emuva kwa-Alonso, ngenca yekumiswa tikhatsi letimbalwa emcintiswaneni."" This directly translates to ""Michael Schumacher finished his race early behind Alonso, because of a problem with the suspension during the race.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uhluleke kulawula imoto yakhe** - This describes Fisichella's issue, not Schumacher's.
*   **B: Kugcundzana na-Alonso** - The text mentions Alonso was suspected of wrongdoing, but that doesn’t explain Schumacher finishing early.
*   **C: Kulimala kwelisondvo lokubangelwe nguFisichella** - Fisichella caused an accident, but it didn’t directly cause Schumacher to retire. The problem was with *Schumacher’s* car.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngumsebenti wabani kubeka ibheyili kulababoshiwe?","The correct answer is **A: Liphoyisa lelibophako (The arresting officer)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...futsi wenta emacala lafakwe ngemaphoyisa labophanako. Loseligunyeni ubeke ibheyili..."" which translates to ""...and deals with cases filed by the arresting officers. That authority sets bail...""

This clearly indicates that the **arresting officer** is the one who sets bail, if it is granted.



"
"Ngekusho kwemyalo wekuvinjelwa kwesikhashane lekukhulunywa ngawo kulendzima, yini lekumele tiboshwa tivunyelwe kuba nako uma kumele tigcinwe sikhatsi lesingetulu kwema-awa langu-24?","The correct answer is **D: Kulalelwa (A hearing)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...umtsetfo wesikhashane wakhishwa nguJaji Glynn kute kucinisekiswe kutsi labo lababoshwe ngetulu kwema-awa langema-24 bafike ejele bayakhululwa **nangabe bengakayi ekulalelweni kwelicala labo** ikhomishana yenkantolo.""

This directly translates to: ""...a temporary order was issued by Judge Glynn to ensure that those arrested for over 24 hours are released **if they have not gone to a hearing for their case** before the court commission.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ibheyili (Bail):** While bail is mentioned, the order focuses on the *right to a hearing*, not just bail. Bail may be set, but the hearing is the key requirement.
*   **B: Umhlangano neliphoyisa lelibophako (Meeting with the arresting officer):** The passage doesn't mention a meeting with the officer as a requirement.
*   **C: Emacala lasemtsetfweni lakhishwe lijaji Glynn (Charges filed by Judge Glynn):** Judge Glynn issued the *order* regarding the timeframe, but didn't file the charges themselves. The charges are filed by police.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngusiphi sizatfu lesingasetjentiswanga kuze kuchazwe kutsi kungani lolukhetfo lukhanselwe?","The correct answer is **B: Kushayisana nemtsetfo sisekelo** (Conflict with the constitution).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Loku kungcubutana nembiko lokhishwe ekucaleni, lotsite kukhansela lomncintiswano kuphambene nemtsetfosisekelo."" This translates to ""This aligns with an earlier report, stating the cancellation of the competition contradicts the constitution."" 

The text explicitly links the cancellation to a constitutional issue.  While costs and security are *mentioned* as concerns, the *reason* given for the cancellation, according to the text, is its conflict with the Afghan constitution.



"
Kungani emancusa agcina atsatse lukhetfo njengalolungadzingeki?,"The correct answer is **C: Bekunekungacaci kahle kumtsetfo sisekelo** (There was a lack of clarity in the constitution).

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Bosomachinga batsi batfole incazelo leyanele yemtsetfosisekelo wase-Afghan kutewuchata ngelukhetfo lolungenasidzingo."" This directly translates to ""Experts say they found insufficient explanation in the Afghan constitution to justify an unnecessary election.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Luphambene nemtsetfo sisekelo** (It violates the constitution) - The passage says the runoff *was considered* to be against the constitution, but the *reason* the experts deemed the election unnecessary was due to a lack of clarity within the constitution itself.
*   **B: Kube netingoti tekuphepha** (There were security concerns) - While the passage mentions safety concerns (""kusindzisa bantfu be-Afghanistan etindlekweni nasekuphepheni""), this is a *result* of the situation, not the *reason* the experts called the election unnecessary.
*   **D: Lolukhetfo beludula kakhulu** (The election was too expensive) - The passage mentions cost (""etindlekweni""), but not as the primary reason for deeming it unnecessary.



"
Ngubani losita i-FATA ngetindzaba temtsetfo?,"The correct answer is **A: Hulumende wase-Pakistan**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the President of Pakistan appointed ""Political Agents"" to govern FATA and that these agents were responsible for providing the government with information (including judicial functions). This directly links the governance and information flow to the **Government of Pakistan**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Emancusa Etepolitiki (Political Agents):** While they *provide* information, they are *part* of the government structure and don't represent an external source of assistance.
*   **C: Mengameli wase-Pakistan (President of Pakistan):** The President appointed the agents, but doesn't directly handle the day-to-day information gathering.
*   **D: Hulumende wemaNgisi (British Government):** The passage discusses Pakistan *after* independence from Britain in 1947. The British government is no longer involved in governing FATA.



"
Ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako lamayelana ne-”Mancusa Etepoliliti” e-FATA langesilo liciniso?,"The correct answer is **B: Akhetfwa ngumengameli wase-Pakistan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mengameli wasePakistani ubeke """"Bantfu labatammelela Kutepolitiki"""" kuze babuse i-FATA..."" This directly translates to ""The President of Pakistan appointed the 'Political Agents' to govern FATA..."".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aniketa lusito lwetemtsetfo (They provide constitutional support):** While they operate within the constitutional framework, the passage doesn't state they *provide* constitutional support, but rather operate *according* to it (Article 247).
*   **C: Alandzela umtsetfo sisekelo wase-Pakistan (They follow the Pakistani Constitution):** They operate *under* Article 247, but the passage doesn't say they actively *follow* the whole constitution. Their powers are specifically defined by that article.
*   **D: Anemandla laphelele ekulawula tindzawo letitsite (They have full powers to control small areas):** The passage doesn't specify the extent of their powers beyond providing the government with what it needs, including judicial functions. It doesn't say they have *full* control.



"
Ngumuphi umklomelo Emma Stone lanconyelwa wona?,"The correct answer is **C: Umlingisi Lohamba Embili** (Best Actress).

Here's why:

The text states Gosling and Stone were nominated for ""Badlali Baseshashalazini Labahamba Phambili"" (Leading Actors). While it doesn't *explicitly* say Stone won for Best Actress, the context clearly indicates she was nominated in that category. The other options are for different roles (Director, Supporting Actor/Actress, Film Editor) and aren't what the text mentions regarding Stone's nomination.



"
Ngumuphi umklomelo lemuvi lengazange inconyelwe wona?,"The correct answer is **B: Tintfo Letibukwako Letihamba Embili**.

Here's why:

The text lists many awards the film *was* nominated for: Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, Cinematography, Film Editing, Original Song, Costume Design, Sound Editing, Sound Mixing and Original Screenplay.  It specifically mentions two songs being nominated for Best Original Song.

It *doesn't* mention any nomination for Visual Effects. Therefore, Visual Effects is the only category from the options that the film wasn't considered for.



"
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokwachubeka kusebenta ngemuva kwekutamatama kwemhlaba?,"The correct answer is **A: Yonkhe imishini yekuhlola eplantini yaseHokuriku**.

Here's why:

The text states the Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata *resumed* operation despite the earthquake. It also mentions damage at the Shika plant and safety checks being conducted. This implies the monitoring equipment at the Hokuriku plant continued to function.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sikhumulo setindzisa lesise-Ishikawa:** The text explicitly states the Noto Airport in Ishikawa is *closed*.
*   **C: Yonkhe imisebenti yakaloliwe:** The text mentions road damage and disrupted train services, indicating operations are *not* continuing as normal.
*   **D: Iplanti yagesi leseNiigata:** While it resumed operation, the question asks what *continued* to operate, and the plant had to be *restarted* which implies it wasn't continuously operating. The monitoring equipment was functioning all along.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokwalimala kulokutamatama kwemhlaba?","The correct answer is **A: Lamanye emakhaya**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Kubikwa kutsi emakhaya lengu-9400 kulesigodzi ete emanti futsi lokungenani emakhaya langu-100 akanaye gesi."" (It is reported that 9400 households in the area are without water and at least 100 households are without gas.) This directly indicates damage to homes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Imishini yekuhlola lemibili eplantini yaseShika** - The text mentions reactors being shut down, but not damage to inspection equipment.
*   **C: Leminye imigwaco** - While the text says ""Leminye imigwaco imoshekile"" (some roads are damaged), the question asks what *is* damaged, and homes are more extensively impacted (9400 without water, 100 without gas).
*   **D: Sikhumulo setindiza saseNoto** - The text states the airport is *closed*, not necessarily damaged. It's a precautionary measure.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi lokungakafakwa kuletimphepha?","The correct answer is **A: Likusasa leJerusalema (The future of Jerusalem)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""hulumende lolandzelako waseJerusalema"" (the future government of Jerusalem) as one of the reported topics. This directly relates to the future of Jerusalem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Imbangala yemphi yanga-1967 (The cause of the 1967 war)** - The passage *mentions* the 1967 war as a historical point of reference (""ngaphambi kwempi yemphumalanga lesekhatsi leyaliwa nga-1967""), but it doesn't delve into the *cause* of the war.
*   **C: Kuba khona kwembutfo wetemphi esigodzini (The presence of a military base in the area)** - The passage states Israel wants a military presence for 10 years and PA agrees for 5, therefore it is discussed.
*   **D: Kubangwa kwemincele (The claiming of land)** - The passage *clearly* discusses land claims – that's the central issue (""IPhalestina ifuna lendzawo ibe yayo"" - Palestine wants this land to be theirs).



"
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungasiyo lenye yetintfo letifunwa yiPalestine?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuba khona lokuchubekako kwembuto wetemphi eSigodzini SaseJordan**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that Palestine wants the land and claims its people historically lived there *before* the 1967 war. It also mentions Israel wanting a military presence in the Jordan Valley for 10 years (and the PA agreeing to 5). This indicates Palestine *doesn't* want a continued military presence there, but rather full control.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Imincele lesekelwe etimeni tangembi kwemphi:** The text directly states Palestine wants the land, implying a desire for borders based on pre-1967 lines.
*   **C: Timphendvulo letimayelana nelikusasa leJerusalema:** The text specifically mentions the future government of Jerusalem as one of the topics being discussed.
*   **D: Kuba khona kwembutfo wetemphi iminyaka lesihlanu eSigodzini SaseJordan:** The text states the PA would agree to a 5-year military presence, not that they desire it.



"
Ma uwufundzele kuliphi live umtsetfo?,"The correct answer is **A: E-United States of America**.

Here's why:

The text states Ma ""wafundza eNew York University naseSikolweni Tetemtsetfo iHarvard"" which are both universities in the United States of America.  Therefore, Ma received his education in the United States.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kumelela liphi live lokwasita Ma kutsi aphumelele lukhetfo?","The correct answer is **A: E-United States of America**.

Here's why:

The passage states Ma ""wafundza eNew York University naseSikolweni Tetemtsetfo iHarvard futsi wake waba """"nelikhadi leliluhlata"""" lekuhlala eMelika sikhatsi lesigcwele."" (studied at New York University and Harvard Law School and once had a ""green card"" for full-time residency in America). This indicates a strong connection and benefit from being in and having residency in the United States, which aided his campaign.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: IHong Kong** - While Ma is from Hong Kong, the passage highlights his education and residency in the US as advantages.
*   **C: INgilandi** - There's no mention of England in the passage.
*   **D: IChina** - The passage mentions he ""waphose wabambana etulu ne Shayina"" (opposed and clashed with China), suggesting a contentious relationship, not assistance.



"
"Njengobe kushiwo kulesicephu, Carolyn Wilson bekasebentela bani ngembi kwekutsi ahambe edolobheni?","The correct answer is **C: I-OHA**.

The passage states: ""Carolyn Wilson wase-OHA bekantjontje imali yabo futsi wabaleka kulelidolobha."" This directly translates to ""Carolyn Wilson of OHA was stealing their money and fled the city."" Therefore, she worked for OHA before leaving town.
"
"Njengobe sekusele imijako lemine kulesizini, ngubani losesigabeni sesine kuloMcudzelwane Webashayeli?","The correct answer is **D: NguBowyer**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Ngelihlandla lesitsatfu, Hamlin usemuva ngemaphuzu langemashumi lamabili, kodvwa uphambili ngalasihlanu kuBowyer."" This means Bowyer is in 5th place, and Hamlin is ahead of him. Therefore, Bowyer is in 4th position.



"
"Kulandzela umcudzelwane lokukhulunye ngawo kulesicephu, Kahne unemaphuzu lamangaki kuloMcudzelwane Webashayeli?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The text states: ""Kahne naTruex, Jr. basendzaweni yesihlanu neyesitfupha ngekulandzelana ngemaphuzu langu-2,220 nalangu-2,207.""  This clearly indicates Kahne has 2220 points."
"Ngekwalesicephu, kukangakhi bantfu babona emateja lawa esibhakabhakeni futsi kamuva abonakala kutsi avela ku-Mars?","The correct answer is **C: Tikhatsi letishumi nesihlanu**.

The text states: ""Lamanye alamatje lokumatima kutsi uwatfole Emhlabeni, atsengiswa nga-US$11,000 to $22,500 li-awunsi, lokuyimali leyendlula cishe ngetikhatsi letilishumi itsengo yeligolide. **Lamanye alamatje lokumatima kutsi uwatfole Emhlabeni, atsengiswa nga-US$11,000 to $22,500 li-awunsi, lokuyimali leyendlula cishe ngetikhatsi letilishumi itsengo yeligolide.**""  It specifically says fifteen meteors were observed in the sky in July.
"
"Njengobe kushiwo esiceshini, ngukuphi lokuliciniso ngematje latfolakele kutsi avela ku-Mars?","The correct answer is **D: Kunalangu-34 awo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kulamatje lati-24,000 lekutsiwa ngema-meteorotes latiwako lawela emhlabeni, angema-34 kuphela lokwacinisekiswa kutsi avela kulenye iplanethi.""  This translates to: ""There are 24,000 meteorites said to have fallen to Earth, only 34 of which have been confirmed to come from another planet.""  This directly answers the question about how many have been confirmed to come from another planet (like Mars).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage states 15 meteors were observed in July, but doesn't say they all came from Mars.
*   **B:** 24,000 is the total number of meteorites *said* to have fallen, not specifically from Mars.
*   **C:** While the passage mentions the price of some meteorites, it doesn't link this specifically to those from Mars.



"
Schumacher uwutsetse nini umhlalaphansi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngemuva kwekutsatsa indzawo yaFelipe Massa**.

Here's why:

The passage states Schumacher ""lowatsatsa umhlalaphansi nga-2006 ngemuva kwekuphumelela umcudzelwano weFormula 1 tikhatsi letisikhombisa, besekufanele angene esikhundleni saFelipe Massa lobekalimele."" This directly translates to he retired after winning seven championships, but then *had to take Felipe Massa's place* because Massa was injured.  Therefore, his return was because he was filling Massa's spot.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngemuva kwekushayisa kwaFelipe Massa:** While Massa's accident triggered Schumacher's return, it wasn't the immediate moment of the crash that made him return, but the need to fill his spot.
*   **B: Ngemuva kwekuphumelela kwakhe umcudzelwane wesikhombisa:** He had already retired after this.
*   **D: Ngemuva kwekuphela kwesizini ya-2009:** He returned *during* 2006, not after the 2009 season.



"
Walimala nini Massa?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngesikhatsi se-Grand Prix**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""LowaseBrazil utfole kulimala enhloko emuva kwekushayisa nakuchubeka i-2009 Hungarian Grand Prix."" This directly translates to ""The Brazilian (Massa) sustained a head injury after an accident during the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ngemuva kwekuphumelela i-Formula 1** - The injury wasn't *after* a win, but *during* a race.
*   **C: Ngembi kwekutsi Schumacher atsatse umhlalaphansi** - While Schumacher returning is mentioned, it isn't directly related to Massa's injury.
*   **D: Ngembi kwesizini ya-2009** -  While the injury happened in 2009, the text specifies it was *during* a Grand Prix.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, loluhlelo lutayitsintsa njani i-AOL?","The correct answer is **C: Linani lababantfu labasebentisa i-AOL litawulingana nelebantfu labasebentisa i-Yahoo kanye ne-Microsoft**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the combined user base of Yahoo and Microsoft *could* rival AOL's customer base. This implies a competition where AOL's dominance is threatened and could potentially equalize in terms of user numbers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Linani lebantfu labasebentisa i-AOL kungenteka likhule:** The passage focuses on competition *reducing* AOL's unique position, not necessarily increasing its user base.
* **B: I-AOL kutawuba ngiyo kuphela inkampani letfutfukise imakethe ye-IM:** The passage explicitly states that Yahoo and Microsoft are also contributing to the development of the IM market, challenging AOL's sole dominance.
* **D: I-AOL angeke iphindze isetjentiswe eMelika:** The passage doesn't suggest AOL will no longer be used, only that its dominance is being challenged.



"
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungase kucephele ngemuva kwaloluhlelo lolusha?,"The correct answer is **C: Inkhululeko ye-AOL yekutfutfukisa imakethe ngelitubane layo** (AOL's freedom to dominate the market with its platform).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on AOL's dominant position in the IM market due to its large user base in America.**  It states that Yahoo and Microsoft combined couldn't compete with AOL's customer base. This implies AOL has a strong advantage and the potential to *continue* dominating.
* **The phrase ""lenkhululeko kungenteka iphele"" translates to ""this freedom could be complete"".** This directly refers to AOL's power to control the market.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kutfutfukiswa lokwandzako kwe-inthanethi eMelika (Further development of the internet in America):** While the internet's development is happening, the passage doesn't suggest this is *caused* by the situation with AOL.
* **B: Labasebentisa imakethe ye-IM (IM market users):** The passage talks *about* the users, but doesn't say they are the outcome of the situation.
* **D: Kuhlangana kwe-Yahoo ne-Microsoft (Yahoo and Microsoft merging):** The passage states they *can't compete* with AOL, not that they will merge.



"
Bangakhi bantfu labafa kulokuhlasela labebangasiwo emaphoyisa?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The text states ""ibulele emaphoyisa lamabili yalimata bantfu labangetulu kwemashumi lamabili"" which translates to ""killed two police officers and injured more than twenty people.""  This means two people who were *not* police officers died in the attack.



"
Ngubani lobike umsolwa kulokuhlasela?,"The correct answer is **A: Emaphoyisa** (The police).

The text states: ""Emaphoyisa atsi asola kutsi libutfo leDaesh (ISIL) leli lelihlasele."" which translates to ""The police say they suspect the Daesh (ISIL) group carried out the attack."" 

Therefore, the police are the ones pointing the finger at the suspect."
"Ngesizatfu sekutsi i-Florida yatiswa njengendzawo lephumelelako, yini leyahlonyeliswa Mitt Romney?","The correct answer is **C: Tonkhe tihambeli tembuso**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Njangaloku lophumelele ebusa wonkhe umbuso, i-Florida inikete Romney tonkhe titfunywa tayo letingemashumi lamahlanu..."" This translates to ""Now that the winner has dominated the entire state, Florida awards Romney all of its 50 delegates...""

This means Romney received all of Florida's delegates as a reward for winning the primary. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tihambeli tembuso letingu-32** - The text states 50 delegates, not 32.
*   **B: Kunconywa kweLicembu Le-The Republican** - While winning helps with endorsement, the direct reward mentioned is the delegates.
*   **D: Emaphesenti langu-46 emavoti** - While 46% is how he won, it's not *what* he was awarded.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngemaphesenti lamangakhi emavoti Gingrich labe nawo elukhetfweni lwekucala?","The correct answer is **B: Emaphesenti langu-32**.

The text states: ""Loyo bekaNgumcondzisi Wetinkhulumo e-U.S. Kulendlu Newt Gingrich uphume waba wesibili ngemaphesenti langu-32."" (Newt Gingrich came in second with 32 percent of the votes)."
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngubani longazange achubeke afuna imiphumela yemhlangano?","The correct answer is **B: NguBachmann**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bachmann, lowine i-Ames Straw Poll ngeNgci, ukhetse kucedza kukhankasa kwakhe."" This translates to ""Bachmann, who won the Ames Straw Poll in August, chose to end her campaign.""  

This clearly indicates she *did not* continue seeking results from the caucus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: NguGingrich** - Gingrich conceded to Santorum but still expressed negativity towards Romney, implying he was still involved.
* **C: NguPerry** - Perry stated he was going back to Texas to assess the situation *before* deciding if he would continue, showing intent to potentially continue.
* **D: NguRomney** - The text doesn't mention Romney ceasing his campaign; it just notes Gingrich's criticism of him.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngubani lowakhuluma kahle ngalomunye ngemuva kwemhlangano?","The correct answer is **B: NguGingrich**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Gingrich wamdvumisa Santorum, kodvwa washo emavi lacinile kuRomney..."" This translates to ""Gingrich conceded to Santorum, but spoke harshly to Romney...""  This indicates Gingrich *did* speak about someone else (Romney) after the results, and it wasn't a positive comment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: NguBachmann:** Bachmann chose to end her campaign, she didn't speak about others.
*   **C: NguRomney:** The text states Gingrich spoke *to* Romney, not that Romney spoke about others.
*   **D: NguPerry:** Perry announced he was returning to Texas, and didn't mention speaking about anyone else.



"
Nguyiphi indzawo lokukuphela kwayo lapho lombukiso lowaba khona ngembi kwa-2015?,"The correct answer is **C: I-AstroNet Radio**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ekupheleni kwa-2015, iTogiNet yasungula i-AstroNet Radio njengesiteshi semsakato. Lombukiso ekucaleni bewunemavi ebantfu labasebasha ekwenteni umbukiso, labahlala eceleni kwaseMphumalanga yeTexas."" This directly translates to: ""At the end of 2015, TogiNet launched AstroNet Radio as a podcast station. The show initially featured interviews with young people running the show, who lived near East Texas.""

Therefore, AstroNet Radio is where the show became available as a podcast at the end of 2015.



"
Siteshi sichaza lombukiso ngekutsi unjani?,"The correct answer is **D: Wasendzaweni**.

Here's why:

The passage states the show is described as ""njengaloyo wasewayilesini yakadzeni lohambisana nalokutsite lokusha lokumangalisako!"" which translates to ""like an old-time radio show with a fresh and exciting twist!"". It also mentions it *started* on a niche internet radio station and was created by young people from a specific area (East Texas).  This all points to it being a *local* or *regional* show initially.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wemafundza (Informative)** - The passage doesn't highlight the show's educational value.
*   **B: Unekuhlakanipha (Intelligent)** - The passage doesn't focus on the show's intelligence or sophistication.
*   **C: Wakudzala (Old)** - While it *evokes* a feeling of old-time radio, the description also mentions a ""fresh"" twist, making it not simply ""old"".



"
Yini David Headley layitfola ekugcineni leyasita tidlamlilo kutsi tihlasele?,"The correct answer is **A: Kwatiswa (Information)**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Kuhlanganisa lulwati kwaDavid Headley kwasita kutsi bakhone kucalisa umsebenti webantfu labangu-10 labaphatsa tibhamu..."" This directly translates to ""Including information from David Headley helped them to identify the 10 people who handled the weapons...""

Therefore, David Headley provided **information** that aided the attackers. The other options are things the attackers *used* (bombs, guns), not what Headley *provided*.
"
Nguyiphi intfo yekuhamba licembu letidlamlilo lelayisebentisa naliya eMumbai?,"The correct answer is **C: Sikebhe** (Ship).

The text states: ""Labahlaseli baseMumbai bafika **ngemkhumbi** ngeLweti 26, 2008..."" which translates to ""The Mumbai attackers arrived **by ship** on November 26, 2008..."".
"
Ngumaphi emavi laveta kahle umphumela wemdlalo we-Nadal ne-Raonic’s Brisbane Open lokukhulunywa ngayo kulesicephu?,"The correct answer is **A: Raonic wehlule Nadal**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Muva nje wehlulwe nguRaonic..."" which translates to ""He was recently defeated by Raonic..."". This clearly indicates Raonic won the match against Nadal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Raonic ube nemaphuzu langemaphesenti langu-88** - The text says Nadal had 88% of the points, not Raonic.
*   **C: Nadal wehlule Raonic** - The text explicitly states Nadal *was defeated* by Raonic.
*   **D: Raonic ushaye emaphuzu langu-76** - The text says Nadal won 76 points in the beginning of the match, not Raonic.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, bekangakanani emaphuzu emdlalo waNadal naRaonic ngemuva kwekudlala kwekucala?","The correct answer is **B: Nadala uwine emaphuzu langu-76**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Nadal utfole emaphoyinti langemaphesenti langema-88 sekaphelele kulomdlalo wawina emaphoyinti langema-76 ekucaleni nje."" (Nadal scored 88% of the points overall in the match and won 76 points in the first set alone.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Raonic ube nemaphuzu langemaphesenti langu-88** - The text says Nadal had 88% of the points, not Raonic.
*   **C: Umphumela ube ngu-7-2** - This is the score of the *set*, not the total points.
*   **D: Raonic wehlule Nadal** - The text states Raonic *defeated* Nadal, but the question asks about points in the first game.



"
Nguluphi luhlelo lwelulwimi lolungakafakwa etinhlelweni letintsatfu letinsha te-Naked News?,"The correct answer is **D: Sipanish**.

Here's why:

The text states that Naked News is planning to launch programs in Spanish, Italian, and Korean *in addition* to already reporting in English and Japanese.  Therefore, Spanish is one of the new languages being added.
"
Ngekwalesicephu kukuphi lapho lenitenlo letinsha te Naked News letingeke tigfolakale knona?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku-inthanethi** (On the internet/online).

Here's why:

The text specifically states the expansion will include ""kuwebhu"" which translates to ""on the web"" or ""online."" While the expansion includes TV and other platforms, the question asks *where* the new content will be found, and the text prioritizes the online expansion.



"
Bangakhi bantfu labangazange bayicedze i-Giant Slalom?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

The text states: ""Besifazane labane emdlalweni wekuhamba echweni behlulekile kucedza umncintiswano wabo, futsi labangu-45 kulabangu 117 kulomdlalo lobewuseGiant Slalom behlulekile kuniketwa sigaba sabo kulomcudzelwano.""

This directly answers the question of how many people didn't finish the Giant Slalom – 45.



"
Ngumaphi emavi kulawa lalandzelako layiveta kahle imiphumela yeMcudzelwane?,"The correct answer is **B: Labantjuzako labangu-45 abacedzanga ku-Giant Slalom**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Besifazane labane emdlalweni wekuhamba echweni behlulekile kucedza umncintiswano wabo, futsi labangu-45 kulabangu 117 kulomdlalo lobewuseGiant Slalom behlulekile kuniketwa sigaba sabo kulomcudzelwano."" This directly addresses the number of competitors who didn't finish the Giant Slalom.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage says Carpenado came in 10th, not second, in Giant Slalom.
*   **C:** The passage states Carpenado did *not* finish the Slalom run. Therefore, we can't say more competitors finished the Giant Slalom than the Slalom.
*   **D:** The passage says Carpenado did *not* finish the Slalom run. Therefore, he could not have placed 10th in Slalom.



"
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako i-NBA lencume kukukhipha?,"The correct answer is **A: Isizini ye-basketball**.

The passage explicitly states that the NBA *suspended the basketball season* due to COVID-19 concerns. The other options are related to the situation, but the direct outcome mentioned is the suspension of the season.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini leyabangela i-NBA kutsi ibe nekukhatsateka ngaleligciwane?","The correct answer is **D: Umdlali we-Utah Jazz utfolakele nalo**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Lesincumo se-NBA salandzela umdlali we-Utah Jazz lowatfola kutsi uneligciwane leCOVID-19."" (The NBA's decision followed a Utah Jazz player being found to have COVID-19).  This directly identifies the player's positive test as the reason for the concern.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Emalunga e-NBA atfolakele analo** - The text doesn't mention NBA officials testing positive.
* **B: Badlali labanyenti batfolakele banalo emdlalweni we-Utah Jazz** - The text only mentions *one* player initially.
* **C: Umdlai we-Utah Jazz akadlalanga kahle ngemuva kwekutfolakala nalo** - The text doesn’t mention performance; it focuses on the positive test.



"
Ngubani lofake ligoli lekuwina le-Washington Capitals emdlalweni ne-Atlanta Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **D: NguAlex Ovechkin**.

The text states: ""Ovechkin was assisted for the first time tonight and assisted rookie player Nicklas Backstrom to score his game-winning goal."" This means Ovechkin *assisted* Backstrom in scoring the winning goal, but Ovechkin didn't score it himself.  However, the text also says Ovechkin scored two goals, one of which was the game-winning goal.



"
Ngubani loshaye ligoli lakhe lesi-60 lesizini emdlalweni emkhatsini we-Capitals ne-Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **C: NguAlex Ovechkin**.

The passage states: ""Leligoli lakhe lesibili ngalobo busuku lenta kutsi emagoli lawashayile kulesizini afike ku 60..."" which translates to ""His second goal tonight brought his goal total for the season to 60..."" This clearly indicates that Alex Ovechkin scored his 60th goal of the season.

The passage also mentions Jaromir Jagr and Mario Lemieux, but states they achieved this feat in a previous season (1995-96). They didn't score the 60th goal *in this particular game*.



"
Kunini laphi libhange i-Northern Rock lidzinge khona kusekelwa nguhulumende?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngesikhatsi kunenkinga yesikweleti sekutsenga indzawo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""I-Nothern Rock beyidzinga lusito ngenca yekunekwa kwayo ebaleni ngesikhatsi inenkinga yesikweleti sayo lesingakavami nga-2007.""  This directly translates to ""Northern Rock needed help because of its problems in the market at the time it had its unprecedented credit crisis in 2007.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngemuva kwekutsi lelibhange lifakwe ngaphansi kwahulumende** - The text says the government *took over* the bank *after* it needed help, not that it needed help *after* being taken over.
*   **B: Ngesikhatsi lelibhange liphuma enkampanini lelawula imphahla** - The text doesn't mention the bank needing help when exiting a mortgage company.
*   **C: Ngemuva kwekutsi licembu le-Virgin litsenge lelibhange** - Virgin *tried* to buy the bank, but the deal failed *before* the government took over.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako lachaza kahle kusebentelana kwe-Virgin Group nelibhange le-Northen Rock?","The correct answer is **C: I-Virgin Group inikete lelibhange lusito loluphutfumako ngesikhatsi senkinga yesikweleti sekutsenga indzawo.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Licembu laSir Richard Branson lelibitwa ngekutsi yiVirgin Group belilibhidele lelibhange kodvwa sicelo salo sangaphumeleli ngaphambi kwekutsi hulumende alitsatse lelibhange."" This means Virgin Group *bid* for the bank (offered help/a potential buyout) but their bid was unsuccessful *before* the government nationalized it.
*   The passage also states: ""I-Virgin itsenge kuphela """"lelibhange lelikahle"""" laseNyakatfo Rock, hhayi lenkapane yekuphatsa imphahla."" This means they eventually bought parts of the bank *after* it was split, but not the part dealing with bad debts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** Incorrect. The passage states Virgin *didn't* buy the asset management part of Northern Rock.
*   **B:** Incorrect. Virgin bid *before* the government took over the bank.
*   **D:** Incorrect. Virgin bid *before* the bank was nationalized, not after.



"
"Njengobe kushiwo kulesicephu, nguliphi live lelitsintfwe kusayinwa kwesivumelwane sesimo selitulu lesentiwa eKyoto?","The correct answer is **A: Yi-United States**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sincumo sa-Mr. Rudd sekusayina sivumelwano seKyoto sishiya iMelika, letawuba ngiyo yodvwa emaveni latfutfukile kungasayini lesivumelwano."" This translates to: ""Mr. Rudd's decision to sign the Kyoto agreement left the United States as the only developed country not to sign the agreement.""

Therefore, the text explicitly identifies the United States as the country that refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol."
Hulumende waphambilini wase-Australia bewucabanga kutsi kucinisekiswa kweKyoto kutawubangela kulimanga kuphi?,"The correct answer is **C: Emalahleni layiswa kulamanye emave**.

Here's why:

The text states the previous Australian government didn't sign Kyoto ""watsi kungenteka kulimate umnotfo ngenca yekuncika kwayo kakhulu ekuhambiseni lilahle emaveni langaphandle, njengaloku emave lafana nendiya kanye neShayina engekho emgomweni wekungagcolisi umoya."" This directly translates to: ""...it could harm the economy because of its reliance on exporting coal to countries like India and China who don't have pollution commitments.""  

Therefore, the previous government believed ratifying Kyoto would harm the Australian economy specifically due to the impact on coal exports.
"
Nguluphi luhlelo badubuli bebabutselwe lona?,"The correct answer is **D: Luhlelo lwebatingeli lwe-Sporting Shooters Association**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...emavolontiya lafanelekako abhaliswa, **ngaphansi kweluhlelo lwekutingela lweSporting Shooters Association**."" This directly indicates the program the shooters were enrolled in.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia is mentioned, the text specifies it's their *hunting program*, not the association itself.
* **B:** Park Conservation and Heritage is a department Mick O'Flynn works for, not a program the shooters were in.
* **C:** NPWS (National Parks and Wildlife Service) collaborated, but didn't *run* the program the shooters were part of.



"
Ngumaphi emavi langakuveti kahle kulawulwa kwetinambutane lokuzanywako?,"The correct answer is **A: Njengobe loluhlelo belwetanywa kwekucala, aluzange luhlolwe.**

Here's why:

The passage states the program was a *first* – ""ekucibishela kwekucala"" – and that its success was being *tested* (""kuhlolwa""). This directly implies there hadn't been prior testing or evaluation of the program's effectiveness in controlling the feral animal population.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Labadubulako batfola ticondziso tekuceceshwa** - The passage states they *received* safety certifications, not that there was a problem with their competence.
*   **C: Labadubulako bebacondziswa bogadzi** - The passage states they were overseen by people who handle animals, implying oversight, not a failing.
*   **D: Kwakhetfwa labadubulako labane** - The passage states four shooters were *selected*, not that there was an issue with the number of shooters.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, lokwehlukana kwatfolakala kuphi?","The correct answer is **D: ETopiya**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the researcher is from Rift Valley Research Service **in Ethiopia** and is discussing a split found through their research. While Rift Valley is *where* the research is based, the split itself was *discovered* in Ethiopia.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E-Rift Valley** - Rift Valley is a location, but the statement speaks of the split happening *in* Ethiopia, which contains the Rift Valley.
*   **B: Kufosili** - The passage doesn't mention fossils specifically. It mentions ""molecular evidence.""
*   **C: Ebufakazini bemagcamzane** - The passage doesn't mention bones or ""magcamzane"". It references ""molecular evidence.""



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini leyenteka ngekushesha kunaloko bekulindzelekile?","The correct answer is **B: Kwehlukana** (Separation/Divergence).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngekuya kwaletinsalela, lokusho kutsi **lokuhlukana** kusheshe kwenteka kunalobekulindzelekile ngebufakazi be-molecular."" 

This directly translates to: ""According to the fossils, this means that **the separation** happened more quickly than expected with molecular evidence.""

The passage is talking about when species diverged (separated) from a common ancestor, and that this happened *faster* than previously thought based on molecular data.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kutfolakala kwefosili** (Fossil discovery) - The passage mentions fossils *providing* the information, but isn’t what happened quickly.
*   **C: Kuhlatiywa kwebufakazi bemangcamuzane** (Molecular evidence analysis) - This is the evidence *used* to make the comparison, not the event itself.
*   **D: Luhlolo lwase-Rift Valley** (Rift Valley research) - This is where the research took place, not what happened quickly."
Yini umdlali lokutawudzingeka ayente kute akhone kuhamba emdlalweni wevidiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Ahambise emoyeni lithulusi lekucondzisa**.

Here's why:

The passage states the controller ""allows players to control actions and movement in video games by *moving the device through the air*.""  This directly corresponds to option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't mention needing to position the controller in relation to the console.
* **B:** While the controller *allows* for movement, it doesn't say the player needs to move *up and down and side to side* specifically. It's the movement *of the controller* that matters.
* **C:** The passage describes two buttons on the side, not a sensor that needs to be placed near the TV.



"
Yini leyentiwa ngendlela yekutsi ifane nerimothi yamabonakudze?,"The correct answer is **A: Emasensa lamabili elithulusi lekucondzisa** (Two sensors for detecting movement).

Here's why:

The passage states the device ""usebentisa tintfo tekuva letimbili letibekwa eceleni kwalomabonakudze"" which translates to ""uses two sensors placed on either side of the television."" This is directly comparable to how a remote control works, using sensors to detect motion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Lithulusi lekucondzisa le-Nintendo Revolution** (The Nintendo Revolution sensor) - While the device *is* part of the Nintendo Revolution system, the passage specifies it's the *two sensors* that function like a remote control.
*   **C: kwetfulwa kwenkhulumo lengumgogodla** (Opening speech of the president) - This refers to Satoru Iwata's speech, not the device itself.
*   **D: Ikhonsoli ye-Nintendo Revolution** (The Nintendo Revolution console) - The console is the whole system, not the specific motion-sensing component."
Yini lengashiwongo embikweni losandza kuphuma lovela enhlanganweni lensha ye-Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **A: Lendiza isongelwe ngebhomu** (The plane was reported to be bombed).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Imibiko yakamuva ibike kutsi indiza itfole imibiko yekutfuswa ngebhomu..."" which translates to ""The latest reports state that the plane received reports of being bombed...""  This directly addresses what the report states.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Indiza ihlale e-Ürümqi** (The plane is stationed in Ürümqi) - The text doesn't mention Ürümqi.
* **C: Lendiza ikhiswe emzileni yayiswa e-Afghanistan** (The plane was diverted and sent to Afghanistan) - While it *ended up* in Afghanistan, the initial report was about a bomb threat, not a diversion.
* **D: Lendiza ihlale e-Kandahar** (The plane is stationed in Kandahar) - The text says it *went to* Kandahar, not that it's stationed there, and the primary issue is the bomb report.



"
Yni lengashiwongo embikweni wekucala wenhlangano lensha ye-Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **C: Lendiza yaphambukiswa yabuyiselwa e-Afghanistan** (The plane was intercepted and returned to Afghanistan).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Imibiko yakamuva ibike kutsi indiza itfole imibiko yekutfuswa ngebhomu yabe seyibuyiselwa emuva e-Afghanistan, yaya kuyohlala eKandahar.""  This translates to ""Recent reports state that the plane received reports of a bomb threat and was then returned to Afghanistan, to land in Kandahar.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lendiza yatfunjwa** (The plane was found) - The passage doesn't say the plane was *found*, but rather *returned*.
* **B: Lendiza ayivunyelwanga kutsi ihlale ngalokuphutfumako** (The plane was not allowed to land) - While it didn't land, the reason wasn't a denial of landing permission, but a bomb threat.
* **D: Lendiza isongelwe ngebhomu** (The plane was threatened with a bomb) - The passage states it *received reports* of a bomb threat, not that it was actively threatened. There's a difference between a report and a direct threat.



"
Yini leyamenyetelwa nguSara Danius eluhlelweni lwewayilesi?,"The correct answer is **D: Ikomidi itokuma kwenta imetamo yekuchumana naBob Dylan**.

Here's why:

The passage states Danius said they had tried contacting Dylan (""ngishayele ngaphindze ngatfumela ema-imeyile kubo bonkhe lesisebentisana nabo"") and received polite responses, but currently, that's enough - implying they are stopping their attempts to reach him for now (""Kwanyalo, loko kuphela kwanele.""). This means the committee will cease efforts to contact Bob Dylan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lophumelele i-Nobel Prize kutetincwadzi** - The passage mentions the Nobel Prize winner but doesn’t say this was *announced* on the radio program.
*   **B: Ikomidi kute timphendvuto letitfolile kulabahlanganyelako** - While the passage mentions receiving responses, it’s about attempts to reach Dylan’s representatives, not general feedback from participants.
*   **C: Labanconyelwe i-Nobel Prize kutetincwadzi nga-2016** - The passage refers to Dylan *winning* the prize, not being nominated.



"
Ngubani lokungafinyelelwanga kuye?,"The correct answer is **D: NguBob Dylan**.

Here's why:

The text states Sara Danius tried to reach Bob Dylan by phone and email, but received ""friendly responses"" from *everyone else* she contacted who works with him. This implies she was unable to connect with Dylan directly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Labasedvute labahlanganyela naBob Dylan** - The text says she *did* get responses from his associates.
*   **B: NguSara Danius** - The text is *about* Sara Danius trying to reach someone.
*   **C: Sikhungo Sekufundza SaseSweden** - This isn't mentioned as being unreachable in the text.



"
Ngubani lophawule watsi lesitsembiso “sisinyatselo lesikhulu”?,"The correct answer is **C: NguGordon Johndroe**.

The passage states that Gordon Johndroe, speaking for Bush, called the involvement of North Korea ""sisinyatselo lesikhulu."" Therefore, he is the one who made the statement."
Tingakhi titembu Słania latikhicitela emave lehlukahlukene?,"The correct answer is **D: Tingetulu kwa-1,000** (More than 1,000).

The text states: ""Ukhicite titembu letingetulu kwa-1000 taseSweden netalamanye emave langu-28."" which translates to ""He created more than 1000 stamps for Sweden and other countries totaling 28.""
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lokungenteka iyimbangela yekuvuta lokuchubekako kwemaventi elithange?","The correct answer is **C: Kwandza kwekushisa**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Sukuloku avuta lokungenteka kwakubangelwa kushisa lokwakungekhatsi kwelithangi."" This translates to ""The venting was caused by unexpected heating of the tank.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Indzawo yesibili yekugcina igcwaliswe yaze yefika emtsameni:** While the text mentions the second containment area, it doesn't link it to the venting.
*   **B: Kuhlola lokwetayelekile kweluhlelo lwekulawula umlilo:** The text says the power outage was *for* a fire safety inspection, but the inspection itself didn't cause the venting.
*   **D: Ngumlilo kulenye yemaphampu aseFort Greely:** The text does not mention any fire at Fort Greely pumps.



"
Kungani emavaluvu ekukhulula avulekile?,"The correct answer is **A: Kube nekukwandza kwekushisa ngekhatsi emathangeni** (There was an unexpected temperature increase in the tanks).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sukulandzela ngaLesitsatfu ntsambama, emathange bekaloku avuta lokungenteka kwakubangelwa kushisa lokwakungekhatsi kwelithangi."" This directly translates to ""Since Wednesday afternoon, the tanks were venting due to unexpected heat in the tank."" The opening of the valves was a result of this unexpected heat buildup.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kuphele gesi ngemuva kwekuhlolwa kwemishini** (The power went out after equipment testing) - The power outage caused the initial issue, but not the valve opening.
*   **C: Emathange bekagcwele aze afika emtsameni** (The tanks were full to the brim) - The text doesn't mention the tanks being overfull as a reason for the valves opening.
*   **D: Indzawo yesibili yekugcina beyingasakhoni kutsatsa imiphongolo leyenele** (The secondary containment area could not hold enough gallons) - This refers to a separate issue with containment capacity, not the reason the valves were opened.



"
"Njenganyalo, aphakeme kangakanani emanti e-The Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **C: Afika elukhalo**.

The text states: ""I-Ninth Ward, lebhekene nesikhukhula lesingetulu kwetinyatselo letingu-20 ngesikhatsi kuchubeka Sikhukhula iKatrina, njengamanje inemanti lafika elukhalweni..."" (The Ninth Ward, facing a storm surge of over 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina, currently has water reaching chest height...).
"
"Ngesikhatsi kuneSiphelo Lokutsiwa NguKatrina, kwentekani e-The Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **B: Emanti labefika elukhalo engca lugidzi**.

The passage states: ""I-Ninth Ward, lebhekene nesikhukhula lesingetulu kwetinyatselo letingu-20 ngesikhatsi kuchubeka Sikhukhula iKatrina, njengamanje inemanti lafika elukhalweni njengoba lelidamu lelisedvute lagcwala laphuphutela."" This translates to: ""The Ninth Ward, facing a flood exceeding 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina, currently has water reaching chest height as the levees nearby begin to fail.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Emanti agcwala aba ngemafidi langu-100** - While the passage mentions a 100-foot breach in the levee, it doesn't say the water *filled* to 100 feet.
*   **C: Emanti bekangefidi langu-20 kuphakama** - The passage says the flooding *exceeded* 20 feet, but doesn't state the water level was at 20 feet.
*   **D: Imvula lengema-intji langu-6 ephula lolugidzi lolonakele** - The passage mentions 6 inches of rain, but doesn't say it caused the levee to break. It says the levee was failing.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungazange kucinisekiswe nguHamilton?,"The correct answer is **A: Kutsi siguli besiya kuphi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the patient *had been* to Nigeria, where Ebola cases were found. Hamilton did not confirm the patient *was going* to Nigeria, but rather that they had a history of travel there.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ematfuba ekutsi letinye tigulane titfole leligcinwane:** The passage confirms the hospital took precautions to *prevent* the spread of the virus to other patients, meaning they acknowledged the possibility.
*   **C: Kutsi tinyatselo letifanele talandzelwa yini:** The passage explicitly states the hospital followed infection control protocols, confirming appropriate measures *were* taken.
*   **D: Kutsi sigulane sikusiphi simo njenganyalo:** The passage states the patient was in ""serious but stable condition"", confirming their current state.



"
Yini bososayensi labafuna kuyitfola?,"The correct answer is **D: Kutsi uMhlaba wakheka kanjani** (How the Earth formed).

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Bososayensi betsemba kutsi batawucondza kutsi emaplanethi akheka njani, *ikakhulukati kutsi uMhlaba wakheka kanjani*..."" (Scientists hope to research how planets are formed, *especially how the Earth was formed*...).  This directly indicates their primary goal is to understand the Earth's formation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lapho tinkhanyeti letinemsila tishayisana nemhlaba** (When asteroids hit the Earth) - While the passage mentions asteroid impacts, it's presented as *part* of understanding how the Earth formed, not the main thing they are researching.
*   **B: Kutsi emaphrotheni akheka njani** (How proteins are formed) - The passage briefly mentions proteins but doesn't say scientists are studying *how* they are formed.
*   **C: Kutsi iyini imikhicito levela etihlahleni, etilwaneni nakuletinye tintfo** (What processes happen in trees, animals, and other things) - This is not mentioned at all in the passage.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguyiphi indzima leyadlalwa ngemaphoyisa endzawo kulokuvalwa?","The correct answer is **C: Acondzisa bashayeli betimoti kuleminye imigwaco**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""kwaze kwasita emaphoyisa langu-80 kutsi akhombise timoto kutsi tihambe ngaletinye tindlela"" which translates to ""and 80 police officers assisted in showing vehicles to travel on other routes."" This directly indicates the police were redirecting traffic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ancusa i-FBI kutsi ivale** - The passage doesn't mention the police *helping* the FBI close anything, only that the closure happened *because* of the FBI.
*   **B: Ancuma kutsi avale** - Same as A, the passage doesn't indicate police requested the closure.
*   **D: Abika kubambeleleka kwetimoti kuleleminye imigwaco** - While they likely observed traffic jams, their *action* was to redirect traffic, not just report the problem.



"
Yini leyenteka ekungeneni kwemashubhu ngesikhatsi kuvaliwe?,"The correct answer is **A: Bekavalekile** (It was closed).

The passage states the Maryland Transportation Authority *closed* the tunnels due to the FBI investigation. This directly indicates they were not open for traffic.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bekasetjentiselwe kuphambukisa:** The passage doesn't mention any redirection of traffic *through* the tunnels. It says police redirected traffic *around* them.
*   **C: Bekavulekele bashayeli betimoti:** This is the opposite of what the passage says - they were closed.
*   **D: Bekugcwele timoti letihamba embili:** The tunnels were closed, so they wouldn't be full of traffic.

"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengazange yenteke ngembi kwekutsi umtsebuli wetitfombe ashayiswe yimoti?","The correct answer is **D: Lomtsebuli wetitfombe wakhona kutsatsa sitfombe saBieber**.

Here's why:

The text states Bieber said he ""wouldn't have met this talented photographer"" and expressed condolences to the family. This implies he *didn't* get to photograph Bieber. The other options are all things that *did* happen according to the text:

* **A:** The text explicitly says the photographer was told by the California Highway Patrol to go back.
* **B:** The text says the photographer parked his car on Sepulveda Boulevard.
* **C:** The text states the photographer was trying to photograph the police car.



"
Yini lomtsebuli wetitfombe lebekatama kuyenta ngembi kwekushayiswa yimoti?,"The correct answer is **B: Kutsatsa titfombe tesitobhu semaphoyisa** (Taking pictures of the police vehicle).

Here's why:

The text states: ""umtfwebuli wetitfombe umise imoto yakhe kolunye luhlangotsi lwe-Sepulveda Boulevard wetama kutfwebula titfombe teliphoyisa lelimako embi kwekutsi liwele umgwaco bese lichubeka..."" This directly translates to ""the photographer parked his car on the side of Sepulveda Boulevard trying to take pictures of the police vehicle as it responded to the accident scene.""  This is what he was doing *before* being hit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kupaka ku-Sepulveda Boulevard** (Parking on Sepulveda Boulevard) - This is *where* he was, not *what* he was trying to do.
*   **C: Kwengca umgwaco lophitsitelako** (Crossing the busy road) - The text doesn't mention him crossing the road.
*   **D: Kuncenga liphoyisa kutsi limvumele achubeke nekutsatsa titfombe** (Asking the police to allow him to continue taking pictures) - The text states the police told him to go back, not that he was asking for permission.

Ngumaphi emavi langasichazi kahle simo samengameli ngemuva kwekutfolakala neligciwane?,"The correct answer is **B: Unemphimbo lobuhlungu** (He has a sore throat).

Here's why:

The text states: *""Ngaphandle kwekushisa nemphimbo lobuhlungu...""* (Despite the heat and a sore throat...). This directly indicates the president is experiencing a sore throat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Akativa kahle** (He doesn't feel well) - While true, it's a general statement. The text provides a *specific* symptom.
*   **C: Simo sakhe sincono** (His condition is improving) - The text doesn't state his condition is improving, only that it's stable.
*   **D: Unemfiva** (He has a fever) - The text mentions ""kushisa"" (heat) but doesn't specifically confirm a fever; it could refer to feeling generally hot.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako laliciniso mayelana namengameli?","The correct answer is **D: Leligciwane limbambe kamatima**. 

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Arias utfolwe kutsi unalo kancane leligciwane"" which translates to ""Arias was found to have a slight illness."" and ""Ngaphandle kwekushisa nemphimbo lobuhlungu..."" which translates to ""Besides fever and body aches..."". This indicates the illness, while slight, *is* affecting him.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ute imfiva (He has the flu):** The text doesn't specifically say he has the flu, just a ""ligciwane"" (illness) with a fever as a symptom.
* **B: Utawuchubeka asekhaya emaviki lambalwa (He will continue to stay home for a few weeks):** The text says he will isolate for ""lamanyentana"" (a few days), not weeks.
* **C: Seweluleme ngalokwenele kutsi angachumana nebantfu ngelucingo (He is too weak to interact with people physically):** He explicitly states he can continue working by *interacting* with others.

"Ngekwalesicephu, kunini lapho siphepho lokutsiwa ngu-Tropical Cyclone lokulindzeleke kutsi sichubeke sehla khona?","The correct answer is **B: Lapho umoya sewehle ngemakhilomitha lacishe abe ngu-83 ngeli-awa**.

Here's why:

The text states ""bekulindzeleke kutsi uchubeke wehla"" (it was expected to continue decreasing) *after* the wind was already at 83 km/h. This directly links the expected decrease with the current wind speed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngembi kwekutsi sifike eMaldives:** The text doesn't say the cyclone will weaken *because* it reaches the Maldives.
*   **C: Ngembi kwekufinyelele lizinga laso lesisetulu:** The text doesn’t mention anything about reaching a peak intensity.
*   **D: Ngembi kwekutsi umoya ufike kumamayela langu-149 ngeli-awa:** The speed being mentioned is about its current speed and not when it’s expected to decrease.



"
Besingakanani sivinini semoya ngesikhatsi siphepho lokutsiwa ngu-Tropical Cyclone Gonu sinemandla kakhulu khona?,"The correct answer is **C: Emamayela langu-149 ngeli-awa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""sifinyelele sivinini lesingemakhilomitha langu-240 ngeli-awa (149 yemamayela ngeli-awa)."" This directly translates to ""reached a speed of 240 kilometers per hour (149 miles per hour).""
* The question asks for the wind *speed* at the peak of Cyclone Gonu. The passage provides that speed as 149 miles per hour.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Emakhilomitha langu-149 ngeli-awa:** This is the speed mentioned for *today* (83 km/h fell to this), not the peak of the cyclone.
* **B: Emamayela langu-240 ngeli-awa:** This is the speed in kilometers, not miles, as the passage also provides the conversion.
* **D: Emakhilomitha langu-83 ngeli-awa:** This is the speed of the wind *this morning*, which was *decreasing*, not the maximum speed of the cyclone.

Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungasiso sici se-Karenia brevis?,"The correct answer is **B: Ingakhubata imiva yebantfu** (It can paralyze the nerves of people).

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Nkhushe ikhicita shevu lolimata simiso setimva, loshevu ungalimata timva kubantfu nasetimfishini."" This translates to ""The bloom produces a neurotoxin that attacks the nervous system, the neurotoxin can paralyze the nerves of people and fish.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ingulolunye luhlobo lwetihlahla tasemantini** (It is a type of marine plant) - While *Karenia brevis* is a marine organism, the text doesn't specifically say it is a plant. It is more accurately described as a phytoplankton.
*   **C: Inemaseli lamanyenti** (It has many cells) - The text doesn't mention anything about the number of cells.
*   **D: Itivelela ngekwemvelo** (It occurs naturally) - The text states it is a ""natural phenomenon"" (intfo lengekwemvelo), but that’s a characteristic of its blooms, not *Karenia brevis* itself. The question asks specifically what *Karenia brevis* *does*.



"
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako iKarena brevis lengakhoni kukwenta?,"The correct answer is **A: Kukhubata imiva yetinhlanti (To kill plant roots)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Inkhushe ikhicita shevu lolimata simiso setimva, loshevu ungalimata timva kubantfu nasetimfishini.""  This translates to ""The algae produces a poison that damages the nervous system, that poison can damage the nerves of humans and fish."" It mentions damage to the *nervous system* (timva), not the *roots* of plants. It also states ""Inhlanti iyafa ngenca yelizinga leliphakeme lebutsi lobusemantini."" which translates to ""Plants die because of the high levels of toxins in the water"". This means the toxin *kills the plants*, but doesn’t necessarily directly attack the roots.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **B: Kwandza kakhulu ngaphansi kwanome ngutiphi timo (To grow rapidly under any conditions)** - The passage says ""Tici temvelo tingahlangana kwakha timo letikahle, tivumele lelulwelwe kutsi lwandze ngelinani ngalokunakekako"" - suggesting growth is spurred by favorable conditions.
*   **C: Kuphazamisa emanti (To disrupt the water)** - The passage states it is a marine organism and causes harmful algal blooms.
*   **D: Kukhicita i-neurotoxin (To produce a neurotoxin)** - The passage explicitly states “Inkhushe ikhicita shevu lolimata simiso setimva” (The algae produces a poison that damages the nervous system).

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions ""heavy rainfall across many areas"" and rainfall up to 6.34 inches, described as ""beneficial."" It also states some rain was accompanied by thunder and lightning.
*   However, the passage explicitly states ""no damage or injuries have been reported"" and does *not* mention any road flooding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Imvula lenenzuzo (Beneficial rain)** - The passage directly states the rain was described as ""beneficial.""
*   **B: Imvula lehambisana nekudvuma (Rain accompanied by thunder)** - The passage mentions some rain was accompanied by thunder and lightning.
*   **C: Umbane lophindzaphindzako (Frequent lightning)** - The passage mentions thunder and lightning which indicates the presence of lightning.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states Felicia *was* a Category 4 hurricane, but *weakened* before disappearing.** It didn't start as a weaker system and *become* Category 4. Option B misrepresents this order.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Imvula lehambisana naso yazuzisa i-Oahu** - The passage directly calls the rainfall ""lezuzisako"" (beneficial).
*   **C: Linyenti letichingi latfola imvula** - The passage mentions ""kuletinyenti taletichingi"" (many areas) received rainfall.
*   **D: Letinye taletimvula betihambisana nembani** - The passage states ""Letinye timvula betihambisana nekudvuma kanye nembani"" (Some rains were accompanied by thunder and lightning).

Ngumaphi emavi laveta kahle imiphumela ye-Hungarian Grand Prix ya-2009?,"The correct answer is **C: Piquet Jr. wacoshwa kamuva** (Piquet Jr. was later fired).

The provided text explicitly states: ""Piquet Jr. wacoshwa ngemuva kweHungarian Grand Prix yanga-2009"" which means he was fired after the Hungarian Grand Prix of 2009.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fernando Alonso watfola ingoti** - The text doesn't mention Alonso winning the Hungarian Grand Prix. It talks about a Singapore Grand Prix incident involving Alonso.
*   **B: Piquet Jr. waphumelela** - The text indicates Piquet Jr. was *fired* after the race, not that he won it.
*   **D: Imoti yekuphepha yatfola ingoti** - The safety car doesn't win races. It's a vehicle used for safety purposes.



"
Yenteke nini lengoti?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngesikhatsi letinye timoti tifaka phethiloli**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while the cars ahead of Alonso were pitting (filling up with fuel), he overtook them. The incident happened *during* the pit stop period for other cars, allowing Alonso to gain positions. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngekushesha ngemuva kwekuma kwa-Alonso kuze imoti yakhe ilungiswe** - The passage doesn't mention his car being fixed.
*   **C: Ngembi kwekuphuma kwemoti yekuphepha** - This isn't the primary timing of the overtake, but a surrounding circumstance.
*   **D: Ngemuva kwekutsi Piquet aye kuyofaka phethiloli** - Piquet is mentioned as being investigated later, but his pit stop doesn't define the timing of Alonso's move.

Here's why:

The passage states that researchers *previously believed* the species had been distinct for a long time ""due to interbreeding"" between the Darwin finch and the cactus finch.  The research showed it hadn't been as long as they thought. This means their initial belief about the *interbreeding* being a long-term factor was inaccurate - it happened more recently than believed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuba khona kwenhlobonhlobo tetintfo** (Existence of species variety) - This is a general statement, not what the research specifically changed their understanding of.
*   **B: Kubika ngetinhlobonhlobo tetintfo** (Reporting on species variety) - This describes what the researchers *did*, not what their beliefs changed about.
*   **D: Kutigucukela kwetinhlobonhlobo tetintfo** (Evolution of species variety) - Evolution is a broader process; the passage focuses specifically on the impact of interbreeding on how long they thought the species had been separate.



"
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungazange kubikwe bacwaningi?,"The correct answer is **B: Budze benchubo yekutigucukela kwemvelo**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** The researchers reported the new species in two papers, even though it was believed the population resulted from long-term interbreeding between the Darwin finch (Geospiza) and a hybrid called the cactus finch. This implies they understand *how* the new species came to be (through interbreeding), but doesn't report on the *reason why* this interbreeding happened or the selective pressures involved (the ""why"" of evolution).
*   **The passage does state:**
    *   **A: Takheka kuphi tinhlobonhlobo letinsha tetintfo** - It specifies the location: the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
    *   **C: Ligama letinhlobo letinsha** - It mentions the Darwin finch (Geospiza) and the cactus finch.
    *   **D: Tinyoni letambandzakanyeka kulokutalana** - It directly says the species arose from interbreeding between the Darwin finch and the cactus finch.

Therefore, the only piece of information *not* reported is the underlying evolutionary reasons or pressures that led to the interbreeding and the formation of the new species."
I-CowParade itawuba kuphi?,"The correct answer is **B: Edolobheni laseBucharest**.

The text states: ""Lidolobha litoba ngelekucala eningizimu yempumalanga yeYurophu kubamba iCowParade... emkhatsini weNhlaba neNgci kulomnyaka."" which translates to ""The city will be the first in Southeastern Europe to host the CowParade... between the World and the Sun this year."" and clarifies that Bucharest is the city hosting it."
Ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako layichaza kahle i-CowParade?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngumcimbi webuciko lomkhulu kunayo yonkhe emhlabeni**.

The passage explicitly states that the CowParade is ""umcimbi webuciko wemphakatsi lomkhulu kunayo yonkhe emhlabeni"" (the largest public art event in the world). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't mention anything about cities being ""vibrant.""
*   **B:** While the Bucharest City Hall *is hosting* the event, the CowParade itself isn't *made by* them.
*   **C:** The passage states it's the first in *southeastern* Europe, not all of southern Europe, and doesn’t mention it being held in summer."
Yini leyabangela kutsi iRussia ivale kusetjentiswa kwe-II-76s?,"The correct answer is **B: Ingoti**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...seyihlangabetane nengoti lenkhulu eRussia kulenyanga lephelile."" (It has encountered a major accident in Russia this past month.) and then ""...IRussia yamisa ema-Il-76s kwesikhashana emvakwalesehlakalo."" (Russia temporarily grounded the Il-76s after the incident.)

This directly links the grounding of the planes to the accident (""ingoti"").  The accident was caused by an engine failure during takeoff.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Emasotja engaphakatsi** (Soldiers inside) - While the text mentions soldiers were on board, this isn't the *cause* of the grounding.
*   **C: Umbutfo wemasotja e-Soviet** (Soviet military fleet) - This is historical context, not the reason for the current grounding.
*   **D: Luphenyo lolusalindziwe** (Ongoing investigation) - The investigation is *because* of the accident, not the reason for the grounding itself."
Iyini i-II-76?,"The correct answer is **C: Indizamshini**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""I-Il-76 beyisolo ilithuluzi lelikhulu lemabutfo omabili eRussia neSoviet kusukela ngabo-1970...""  ""Ilithuluzi"" translates to ""tool"" or ""instrument"", and the context describes it being used by armies. This points to it being a machine, specifically an aircraft (a type of indizamshini). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umkhumbi lohamba phansi emantini** - This translates to ""submarine,"" which doesn't fit the context of being used by armies and having engines that can fail during takeoff.
*   **B: Lithange** - This translates to ""rock"" or ""stone"" - clearly not a military tool.
*   **D: Sitimela** - This translates to ""train"" - also doesn't fit the context.

"
"Ngekwa Fluke, ngubani lobekamtfumelela emavi netikhutsato letakhako?","The correct answer is **D: Kokubili labadvuna nalabasikati**.

Here's why:

The passage states Fluke achieved her goal because of ""lokunyenti lokuhle netikhutsato latfunyelelwa tona ngulabanye besifazane nebesilisa"" (much good and encouragement received from other women and men). This clearly indicates support came from *both* genders.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bodokotela (Doctors):** While doctors might be involved in family planning, the passage doesn't specifically mention them as the source of the encouragement.
*   **B: Tishoshovu temphilo yalabasikati (Women's health advocates):** This is a possibility, but the passage broadens the support beyond just advocates.
*   **C: Labadvuna (Men):**  While men *are* mentioned as a source of support, it's not exclusively from them.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini labanye bantfu lebebangafuni bantfu labasikati bakhulume ngayo?","The correct answer is **C: Imphilo yalabasikati** (The health of women).

Here's why:

The passage states Fluke wrote about experiences *made by others* to get women to talk about their *successful lives*.  It connects this to the importance of family planning being seen as healthcare.  This implies that previously, there was resistance to women openly discussing their health and reproductive lives.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bantfu labadvuna** (Men) - The passage mentions men supporting family planning, not suppressing women's voices.
* **B: Tindlela tesibhedlela** (Hospital methods) - The passage focuses on the topic of discussion, not *how* healthcare is delivered.
* **D: I-Fluke** (Fluke) - The question asks what others didn't want discussed, not about Fluke herself.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguyiphi intfo emkhatsini lehamba kakhulu?","The correct answer is **A: Umhlaba**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: *""Ngokwaloko lesikwatiko, kunendzawo yinye yeplanethi lekhombisa bukhulu kundlula i-Titan, ligama layo nguMhlaba,""* which translates to: *""According to the scale, there is one planet that shows a size larger than Titan, and its name is Earth.""*

Therefore, the passage identifies Earth as the largest object discussed."
Imifula nemachibi lanalokungemanti itfolakele kuphi?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kutawubonakala ngale njengemanti. Nangabe bowume ngaselwandle, ungakhona kubona phansi ubone ematje lamancane lasekujuleni kwelwandle."" (It would look like water. If you were an ocean dweller, you could see down and see small lakes deep in the ocean.) and ""...ligama layo nguMhlaba,"" (its name is Earth). This is comparing Titan to Earth, and implying that Titan has features *like* Earth's oceans and lakes.  The passage specifically talks about finding rivers and lakes *on* Titan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jupiter** - Jupiter is a gas giant and doesn't have a solid surface for rivers and lakes to exist on.
*   **C: Lilanga (Sun)** - The Sun is a star, made of plasma, and has no rivers or lakes.
*   **D: Saturn** - While Saturn has moons (like Titan) with potential for liquid, the passage focuses specifically on Titan.

Ngukuphi kwaloku lokutfolakele lokungasiwo umphumela walokunye lokuye kwatfolakala ngetinsiba?,"The correct answer is **A: Umbala wetimphiko tesilwane** (The color of the animal's feathers).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bososayensi batsi tinsiba talesilwane betinsundvu etulu bese siba nembala lophaphatsekile emaceleni."" (Scientists say the animal’s feathers were fluffy and had a fringed color on the edges.) This finding about color is *new* information gained from the feathers themselves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kucondza lokutsi tinsiba atisetjentiswanga ekundizeni** (The suggestion that feathers weren’t used for flight) – The passage presents this as a hypothesis *based on* the feather structure, but the feather structure itself wasn’t a completely new discovery.
* **C: Kucondza ngekugucuka kwetinsiba** (The suggestion about the evolution of feathers) – This is also a conclusion drawn *from* the feathers, not the feathers themselves being a novel finding.
* **D: Sicinisekiso sekutsi ema-dinosaur anetinsiba** (Confirmation that dinosaurs had feathers) – The passage states this was already a known belief (""inkholelo leyandzile""). The discovery *adds detail* to that belief, but isn’t the initial confirmation.



"
Yini tinsiba te-dinosaur betite kona?,"The correct answer is **C: Timphiko letindzala**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bososayensi batsi tinsiba talesilwane betinsundvu etulu bese siba nembala lophaphatsekile emaceleni."" This directly translates to ""Some scientists say the dinosaur's feathers were long and had a fluffy color on the edges.""  Therefore, the dinosaur had feathers. The passage also refers to parts of the feathers like rachis, barbs and barbules.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ema-barbules:** Barbules are *part* of the feathers, not the feathers themselves.
*   **B: Ematsambo:** The passage doesn't mention bones directly in relation to the feathers.
*   **D: Lingaphansi lelinembala lophaphatsekile:** While the passage mentions a fluffy color on the edges of the feathers, it's describing a characteristic *of* the feathers, not what the feathers *are*.

Ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako mayelana ne-ZMapp langasilo liciniso?,"The correct answer is **B: Iyakhona kwelapha titfo letivele tikhona kodvwa akukuvikeli kufa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...akukho lokutsite lokukhona kwekwelapha bantfu labangenwe ngulesifo."" (currently there is no evidence of curing people infected with the disease).  And ""...tifundvo letihlelekile takhomba kutsi inelusito loluncane kunalokudzingekile kuvimbela kufa."" (studies have shown it has less benefit than needed to prevent death). This directly contradicts the idea that it *does* help treat the disease, even if it doesn't prevent death.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Yakhiwa ngemasotja emtimba** - The passage states, ""Yinye i-cocktail yemasotja emtimba, iZMapp..."" (One cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp...)
* **C: Isebenta ekulawuleni elucwaningweni lwe-PALM** - The passage says, ""ZMapp yasetjentiswa ngenjongo yekucodzisa, lokusho kutsi bososayensi bayisebentisa njengesisekelo futsi bacatsanisa naleti letinye tindlela letintsatfu tekwelapha."" (ZMapp was used for comparison, meaning scientists use it as a basis and compare it to other potential treatments). This means it's central to the PALM study.
* **D: Lucwaningo luvete kutsi tinzuzo tayo tincane kunaleto ekucaleni bekucatjangwa kutsi inato** - The passage confirms this with, ""...tifundvo letihlelekile takhomba kutsi inelusito loluncane kunalokudzingekile kuvimbela kufa."" (studies have shown its benefits are less than initially thought).



"
Ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako laluchaza kahle lucwaningo lwe-PALM?,"The correct answer is **C: I-ZMapp yasetjentiswa njengesisekelo selucwaningo**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states: ""Kuloluhlolo i-PALM, ZMapp yasetjentiswa ngenjongo yekucodzisa, lokusho kutsi bososayensi bayisebentisa njengesisekelo futsi bacatsanisa naleti letinye tindlela letintsatfu tekwelapha."" (In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used for comparison, meaning scientists used it as a basis and compared it to other experimental treatments.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't say the trial was to see if there were *more* benefits than anticipated. It was about comparing ZMapp to other options.
* **B:** While the passage mentions ZMapp being compared to other treatments, it doesn't state that the trial *was* the comparison itself. ZMapp was the starting point *for* the comparison.
* **D:** The passage explicitly states ZMapp showed ""little benefit"" in preventing death, so it wasn't successful in treating existing infections.

Bacwaningi bacabanga kutsi i-chip lensha itoba lusito kuphi?,"The correct answer is **A: Emave laphuyile** (In developing countries).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the chip could help diagnose diseases like cancer early, tuberculosis, and HIV ""etigulaleni letisemaveni lahola kancane"" which translates to ""in patients in developing countries"".  The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Emave lanjingile** (Developed countries) - The passage focuses on helping countries with limited resources.
*   **C: E-United States** (United States) - While the research is from Stanford, the *impact* is intended for developing countries.
*   **D: ENyuvesi yaseStanford** (Stanford University) - Stanford is where the chip was developed, not where it will be used.

The text specifically states the tool ""lengakhiwa kusetjentiswa iphrinta i-inkjet levamile"" (can be made using a common inkjet printer). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I-U.S. cent yinye** - This refers to the *cost* of the tool, not *how* it's made.
*   **C: Ema-chip laphrintekako** - While it's printed, the text doesn't say it's a chip. It's a tool that can analyze samples.
*   **D: Lamanye emathulusi ekuhlola** - This is too general. The text gives a specific method of creation.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi emavi langasilo liciniso mayelana nema-lobate scarps?","The correct answer is **B: Kuba khona kwawo kusho kutsi inyanga inaso sandla kulokwenteka emhlabeni.**

Here's why:

The passage *specifically states* that the formation of the lobate scarps **contradicts** the idea that the moon is not interacting with processes on Earth. The scarps' recent formation suggests lunar activity *is* related to Earth events.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Loko lokwabangela kutsi akheke kungenteka kusandza kwenteka** - The passage does suggest they formed relatively recently, but this isn't a false claim *about* the scarps themselves, it's a finding *about* them.
*   **C: Kungenteka avela ngenca yekuncipha kwenyanga** - The passage states the scarps are *caused by* the moon shrinking, not that the shrinking *is* the scarps.
*   **D: Akasimanyenti latfolakala enyangeni** - The passage says remnants are found *all over* the moon, meaning they *are* widespread.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumuphi umbono mayelana nekuma kwemhlaba loveta kutsi kukhona lokwentekako enyangeni lokutsintsa umhlaba?","The correct answer is **D: Lokwenteka kwetintfo emhlabeni kusandza kwenteka.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the features on the moon (""lobate scarps"") suggest the moon is shrinking. It *also* points out that these features are found all over the moon *and* appear relatively young (""tabonakala titincane, lokwakhombisa kutsi loku lokwatidala kwakusandza kwenteka"").  This youthfulness implies that the processes causing the shrinking are *recent* and therefore connected to current geological activity on Earth (which the passage says the shrinking contradicts).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Inyanga iyancipha kancane kancane** - While true according to the passage, it doesn't directly address the connection to what's happening *on Earth*.
* **B: Lokwanteka kwetintfo emhlabeni kwenteka kadzeni** - The passage argues *against* the idea that Earth's activity doesn't impact the moon.
* **C: Kunetintfo letincane kakhulu enyangeni** - The passage mentions small features, but the key is their *age* – their recent formation – not just their size.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengeke ibe ngetulu kwaloku kuze kubekwe licala?","The correct answer is **B: Kushicilelwa Kwetitfombe** (Publication of photos).

Here's why:

The text specifically states that the photos of the accused have been ""circulated everywhere"" and this is considered a common practice in the UK and Scottish justice systems, which courts are looking to restrict as it can demonstrate bias. This is the key issue preventing the case from progressing. The other options are related to the case but aren't the direct impediment mentioned in the passage.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Emavi lengetiwe** (False allegations) - Not discussed in the text.
*   **C: Kucoca ngebufakazi balabatibonele ngewabo** (Contamination of witness evidence) - While the text mentions witness evidence *could* be compromised, the photo circulation is the current, concrete problem.
*   **D: Kushicilelwa kwetihloko** (Publication of headlines) - This is too general; the specific issue is the photos themselves.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengasiyo inkinga lekhona nyalo kubantfu labatingela emasili?","The correct answer is **C: Bukhulu belichwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bukhulu kanye nebududla balelichwa lelihlanganisiwe, ngekuya kwaPittman, ngulembi kakhulu leke yabakhona kubavali balo eminyakeni lengu-15 leyengcile."" This translates to ""The size and density of this combined swarm, according to Pittman, is the worst it has been in the last 15 years for beekeepers.""

The passage explicitly identifies the *size* of the swarm as the primary problem. While the bad weather (A) is mentioned as hindering rescue efforts, and density (B & D) are part of the issue, the **size** is highlighted as being unprecedented.



"
"Ngetulu kwelichwa, yini lenye lephazamisa imetamo yekuhlenga?","The correct answer is **B: Simo selitulu**.

The passage explicitly states: ""simo selitulu lesibi kakhulu sibambetele imitamo yekusindzisa"" (the very bad weather conditions are hindering rescue efforts). This directly connects bad weather to the difficulty in rescue operations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kushoda kwetintfo (Lack of things/resources):** The passage doesn't mention a lack of resources.
*   **C: Kushoda kwelusito (Lack of help):** While rescue efforts *are* happening, the passage focuses on the *hindrance* to those efforts, not a complete lack of help.
*   **D: Labatingela emasili (Those hunting animals):** This is not mentioned in the passage at all.



"
Nguyiphi inkholela Roberts lagwema kuyicinisekisa?,"The correct answer is **C: Kucala kwemphilo** (When life begins).

Here's why:

The passage states Roberts ""wala kusho lokutsite mayelana naloko lakukholelwako ngekutsi kuphila kucala kuphi"" (refused to say anything about what he believes about when life begins). This explicitly shows he avoided clarifying his personal belief on this fundamental question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Similo sekucoca ngemacala** (The virtue of clarity in cases) - While he spoke about precedent, he didn't avoid being clear about his stance *on* cases, but rather on a foundational belief.
*   **B: Kubaluleka kwetijubo teNkantolo Lephakeme letingashintjashintji** (The importance of unchanging Supreme Court precedents) - He *emphasized* this, he didn't avoid it.
*   **D: Lilungelo lekugcina tintfo tiyimfihlo** (The right to privacy) - He acknowledged believing in the right to privacy as connected to Roe, so he didn't avoid confirming that belief.



"
Ngusiphi sihloko Roberts leva ngatsi asifaneleki kutsi kucocwe ngaso?,"The correct answer is **D: Imininingwane yemacala** (Details of cases).

Here's why:

The text states: ""utsite akukalungi kukhuluma ngaletintfo"" (he said it's not good to talk about these things) referring to where you stand on beliefs about where life begins. This implies Roberts believes discussing the details of *personal beliefs about when life starts* is inappropriate, particularly in relation to legal arguments.  This connects to the core of the cases being discussed – the details of the arguments surrounding abortion and when life begins.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kungashintjashintji kweTijubo Tenkantolo Lephakeme** (Changes to the Supreme Court's precedents) - While Roberts mentions the importance of precedent, he doesn't say it's a topic not to be discussed.
*   **B: Sincumo ecaleni la-Roe naWade** (The decision in Roe v. Wade) - He specifically talks *about* the Roe v. Wade decision.
*   **C: Lilungelo lebumfihlo lobunconywako** (The right to privacy) - He acknowledges the connection between privacy rights and Roe v. Wade, not that it’s a taboo topic.



"
Imisebe yekukhanya lemibili ikhanya kuphi?,"The correct answer is **A: Kubheka esibhakabhakeni** (Looking at the sky).

The text states: ""Imisebe lemibili yekukhanya imiswe yabuka etulu, kuze ikhombe esibhakabhakeni ebusuku."" which directly translates to ""The two beams of light were stopped, looking up, pointing to the night sky.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngesheya kwelidolobha** (Outside the city) - The text doesn't mention the lights being outside the city.
* **C: Lakuhloswe khona indiza yekucala** (Where the first plane aimed) - While a plane *is* arriving, the lights aren't necessarily pointed *at* where it's aiming, just upwards.
* **D: Ekhatsi nepaki yesikhumbuto** (Next to the memorial park) - The text mentions a park nearby, but doesn't say the lights are pointed *at* it.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, titezi titokwakhiwa nini kulendzawo?","The correct answer is **D: Nakusachubeka kwakha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kwakhiwa kwemabhilidi lamade lamahlanu kuyachubeka endzaweni yesakhiwo..."" which translates to ""Five long buildings were being built and construction continues in the building area..."". This directly indicates that construction is *currently* ongoing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ekhatsi nelilanga** (Day and night) - The passage doesn't specify construction happens both day and night.
*   **B: Nga-8:46 ekuseni** (At 8:46 am) - This is the time the scene is *set*, not when construction began.
*   **C: Ebusuku** (At night) - While there's mention of a ""night sky"", it doesn't mean construction only happens at night.



"
Ngukuphi kwatiswa lokuveta kutsi i-The Seven Sisters mihume?,"The correct answer is **B: Bukhulu balakungenwa khona kulemihume**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that ""Tonkhe tindzawo letisekungeneni kwemihume, letetsiwa ngekutsi """"Bosisi Labasikhombisa"""", lokungenani tingemamitha langu-100 kuya kulangu-250 (328 kuya ku-820 wemafidi) bubanti.""  This translates to: ""These areas, known as """"The Seven Sisters"""", are at least 100 to 250 meters (328 to 820 feet) in diameter.""

The passage *defines* The Seven Sisters by their size.  The other options are mentioned in the text but don't *identify* what The Seven Sisters are.



"
Kubonakala kanjani kushisa ku-Seven Sisters?,"The correct answer is **B: Imigodzi lejulile emhlabatsini** (Deep canyons on the planet).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kushisa kwawo akukemi ndzawonye njengemihume lemikhulu emhlabeni...kodvwa kuyefana ngaloku kuyimigodzi lephansi kakhulu kulomhlaba.""  This translates to: ""...their heat is not uniform like the large dunes on Earth...but it is similar to very deep canyons on Earth.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngetitfombe te-infrared** (With infrared images) - Infrared images were *used* to observe the temperature differences, but they don't *describe* what the temperature is *like*.
*   **C: Bukhulu bemihume** (The size of the dunes) - The passage mentions size, but relates it to the range of measurements, not the temperature.
*   **D: Luhlolo lwemihume emhlabeni** (Investigation of the dunes on Earth) - This isn't what the passage describes; it's a comparison to Earth's canyons.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi emavi langasilo liciniso mayelana nemsolwa?","The correct answer is **D: Bekangakalimali**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""emvakwekulimala kulokuchuma"" - meaning he was *injured* in the explosion. Therefore, he wasn't unharmed (""bekangakalimali"" means he was unharmed).

Let's look at why the other options are likely true based on the text:

* **A: Wasebentisa imoti kulokuhlasela:** The text mentions he drove a car ""lenemasondvo lamatsatfu lenetibhamu yacondza esicukwini sebantfu"" - a car with explosives aimed at people. This implies use in an attack.
* **B: Kusolwa kutsi wachumisa sichumane:** The text states he was arrested ""emvakwekulimala kulokuchuma"" - after being injured in the explosion, implying he detonated the bomb.
* **C: Buve bakhe batiwa tiphatsimandla:** The text says, ""Ligama lakhe solo alatiwa kutiphatsimandla"" - his name is also allegedly linked to militants.



"
Ngukuphi kwatiswa lokumayelana nekuhlaselwa lokucinisekiswe tiphatsimandla?,"The correct answer is **C: Sisusa salokuhlasela**.

Here's why:

The text describes an attack (a bombing targeting civilians). The question asks what information was *revealed* about the attack itself, following the arrest.  While the text *mentions* the suspect (options A, B, and D), the core information being *revealed* is the *nature* of the attack – that it happened, it involved a car bomb, and it targeted people.

Let's break down why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Kutsi bobani lebebasebentisana nemsolwa** - The text doesn't mention any accomplices.
*   **B: Buve bemsolwa** - While the text states he was injured, it doesn't provide details *revealed* about his background.
*   **D: Ligama nesibongo semsolwa** - The text states his name isn't being released, so it wasn't *revealed*.



"
Nguliphi licembu lelitodla emdlalweni e-Ellis Park?,"The correct answer is **C: South Africa ne-Australia**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Umdlalo wekugcina waloluchungechunge utobanjelwa e-Ellis Park eJozi kuleliviki lelitako, Amabhokobhoko atodlala ne-Australia."" 

""Amabhokobhoko"" refers to the Springboks (South Africa's national rugby team). Therefore, the final match will be between South Africa and Australia.



"
Ema-Springboks atawudlalela kuphi umdlalo wawo lolandzelako?,"The correct answer is **C: E-Johannesburg**.

The text states: ""Umdlalo wekugcina waloluchungechunge utobanjelwa e-Ellis Park eJozi kuleliviki lelitako, Amabhokobhoko atodlala ne-Australia.""  Ellis Park is in Johannesburg.



"
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako siteshi sasemkhatsini lesibe nenkinga nako ekhatsi nalomsebenti?,"The correct answer is **B: Kugcina i-gyroscope** (It retains the gyroscope).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""noma kulahleke i-gyroscope ekucaleni, futsi batakwenta loko luze luphele luhambo lwasemkhatsini."" (even though the gyroscope was lost at the beginning, they will continue until the end of the space journey). This directly links the problem to the gyroscope.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kugcina libanga lelifanele kusuka enjinini lencane** (It maintains the proper distance from the small engine) - This isn't mentioned as a problem or a solution.
*   **C: Kusebentisa indiza** (It uses an airplane) - The text refers to a space station and a space journey, not an airplane.
*   **D: Kutfola simo sengcondvo lesetayelekile** (It achieves a stable condition) - While the text says a normal condition was restored, it doesn't say *what* achieving that condition *is*, but refers back to the gyroscope issue as the initial problem.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, wawuyini umgomo wesiteshi sasemkhatsini?","The correct answer is **C: Kucedzela luhamba lwasemkhatsini** (To complete the space journey).

Here's why:

The text states the crew will *continue their good condition until the space journey is complete* even after losing the gyroscope. This indicates the primary goal is to finish the mission.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kutfola i-gyroscope lelahlekile** (To find the lost gyroscope) - While the gyroscope was lost, the text focuses on continuing *despite* the loss, not on retrieving it.
*   **B: Kusondzela etinjinini letincane** (To approach small engines) - This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Kwenta tindiza tisebente** (To make planes work) - The text mentions engineers working on the plane *on the ground*, not the spaceship's primary mission.



"
Ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako langesilo liciniso ngelicala?,"The correct answer is **C: Kulelicala kwasetjentiswa umtsetfo lomayelana nemilayeto yelikheli le-inthanethi langafuneki.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states the lawsuit was about *spam* which is unwanted email - effectively unsolicited internet addresses. This links directly to a law regarding unwanted internet address usage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Latekwa esifundzeni lapho i-AOL inenhlokohhovisi khona** - While the case *was* in Virginia, where AOL is located, this is a detail, not the core fact *about* the case itself.
*   **B: Kwakhishwa sigwebo** - The passage states a settlement was reached, but doesn't say a *judgment* was issued.
*   **D: I-AOL yabekwa licala** - The passage says AOL *settled* the case, implying they were accused, but it doesn't state they were *sued* directly (though it's heavily implied). The focus is on the nature of the case.



"
Ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako lalichaza kahle lelicala?,"The correct answer is **A: I-AOL yabekwa licala lekutfumela kungacelwanga**.

Here's why:

*   The passage clearly states that AOL was ""legcugcutele lamacala"" (sued) because of sending unwanted emails (""kuncishiswe ema-e-mail lamanyenti""). This directly relates to being sued for spam or unsolicited communications.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** While the passage mentions two leading internet companies, the case wasn't *between* them; it was *against* AOL.
*   **C:** The year 2003 is just a reference point for when the law was passed, not what the case was *about*.
*   **D:** The passage says AOL was *sued*, not that they initiated the lawsuit.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguliphi licembu Vidal lacale kulidlalela kumasizini lamatsatfu lendlulile?","The correct answer is **A: Yi-Sevilla**.

The text states Vidal joined Barça *from* Sevilla three years ago. Therefore, he was playing for Sevilla before joining Barça.



"
Mingakhi imidlalo Vidal layidlala ku-Barça?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The text states: ""Kusukela ahamba waya enhloko dolobha lebitwa ngekutsi yiCatalan, Vidal sowudlale imidlalo lengu-49 kulelicembu."" (Since he went to the city called Catalan, Vidal has now played 49 games for the team.)
"
Nguliphi licembu bebadlala nalo?,"The correct answer is **B: Yi-Bolonia**.

The text states Jarque was preparing for a match *against* Bolonia (""lolungiselwe lisontfo neBolonia""). Therefore, Bolonia is the team they were going to play.



"
Kungani Jarque bekahlala ehhotela?,"The correct answer is **C: Bekanemdlalo ngeLisontfo** (He had a game with Lissone).

Here's why:

The text states Jarque was at the hotel ""ngembikwemdlalo lolungiselelwe ngeLisontfo neBolonia"" (because of the game scheduled with Lissone and Bologna). This directly indicates he was there *for the game*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bakatilungiselela** (They were preparing) - While preparation is implied, it doesn't explain *why* Jarque specifically was at the hotel.
*   **B: Bekanemhlangano wangembi kwekucala kwesizini** (He had a pre-season meeting) - The text doesn't mention any meetings.
*   **D: Bekatilolonga neBolonia** (He was playing against Bologna) - He was playing *with* Lissone and Bologna was also involved in the schedule but wasn't the sole reason he was at the hotel.



"
Kungani i-ejensi yesayensi yemhlaba yaseJakarta ingazange ikhiphe secwayiso?,"The correct answer is **D: Beyite emandla ladzingekako ekutamatameni kwemhlaba**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""kute secwayiso setsunami lesitomemetelwa ngoba lekutatama akukahlanisi lelizinga lelibekiwe la-6.5 lelidzingekako."" This translates to: ""there was no tsunami warning because the earthquake did not meet the required magnitude of 6.5.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bekute ingoti yetsunami:** The text doesn't mention any indication of a tsunami, just that the earthquake wasn't strong enough to trigger one.
*   **B: Kugwema kwetfusa takhamuti:** The text does mention people evacuating, but not as a preventative measure for a false alarm – they evacuated because of the *possibility* of a tsunami even though no warning was issued.
*   **C: Kuvikela emabhizinisi endzawo kutsi angatsintseki:** Protecting businesses isn't the reason for issuing or not issuing a tsunami warning. Safety of life is the priority.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini leyabangelwa ngulokutamatama kwemhlaba?","The correct answer is **C: Kwakhishwa secwayiso** (A warning was issued).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""kute secwayiso setsunami lesitomemetelwa"" (a tsunami warning was issued).  Even though the earthquake didn't meet the criteria for a real tsunami, a warning *was* issued.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bantfu bendzawo betfuka (Locals evacuated)** - This was a *result* of the warning, not the direct cause of the earthquake.
* **B: Kwaba nengoti yetsunami (There was a tsunami threat)** - The passage explicitly says a tsunami *wasn't* expected because the earthquake wasn't strong enough.
* **D: Kwakunemandla langu-6.5 ngekwesikali (It had a magnitude of 6.5 on the scale)** -  The passage states the earthquake did *not* reach a magnitude of 6.5.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokubangela kutsi kwenteke lokutsite elangeni nakuto tonkhe tinkhanyeti?,"The correct answer is **C: Kutungeleta kanye nekukhanya** (Rotation and light).

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""Kukhanya nekutungeleta kusetjentiswa kanyekanye kutfola inombolo yeRossby yenkhanyeti..."" (Light and rotation are used together to find a star's Rossby number...).  The passage links these two factors to the phenomenon described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kukhanya nekugeleta kwe-plasma** (Light and plasma convection) - While plasma convection is *related* to the magnetic activity, the passage specifically links light and rotation.
* **B: Inombolo ye-rossy, kutungeleta, nekujika kwatibutse** (Rossby number, rotation, and axis tilt) -  The Rossby number is *calculated* using light and rotation, it isn’t a fundamental *cause* as the passage describes. Axis tilt isn't mentioned.
* **D: Kukhanya, inombolo ye-rossby, nekujikeleta** (Light, Rossby number, and rotation) -  Similar to B, the Rossby number is a result of light and rotation, not a cause.



"
Inombolo ye-Rossby yenkhanyeti incunywa kanjani?,"The correct answer is **A: Kukhanya nekujikeleta** (Light and rotation).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kukhanya nekutungeleta kusetjentiswa kanyekanye kutfola inombolo yeRossby yenkhanyeti..."" which translates to ""Light and rotation are used together to obtain the Rossby number of a star...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Linani lekugeleta kwe-plasma** (Amount of plasma flow) - While plasma flow *relates* to the Rossby number (as the number relates to plasma flow), it's not *how* the number is calculated *from the text*.
*   **C: Lizinga lalokwentekako** (Level of occurrence) - This doesn't make sense in the context of a scientific measurement.
*   **D: Bungako bekujika kwatibutse** (Amount of axis tilt) - While tilt can influence stellar behavior, it's not mentioned as part of the Rossby number calculation in the text.



"
Mangakhi emaphesenti ebantfu lokwentiwa kubo luhlolo labasekela kutsi ngekushesha i-Australia ibe live lelinahulumende lotimele?,"The correct answer is **A: Emaphesenti langu-31**.

The text states: ""29 wemaphesenti alabo lababutiwe bakholwela kutsi i-Australia kumele ibe yive lelibuswa ngentsandvo yelunyenti ngekushesha, kantsi labangephesenti langu 31 bona batsi i-Australia akumele ibe yive lelibuswa ngentsandvo yelunyenti."" This means 31% of those polled *did not* want Australia to become a republic immediately. However, the question asks for the percentage who *support* becoming a republic immediately, which is 29%.

My apologies, I misread the question. The question is asking for the percentage who *believe Australia should become a republic immediately*, which is **29%**.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Emaphesenti langu-29**.
"
"NgekwaJulie Gillard, kunini lapho i-Australia kufanele ibe nahulumende lotimele?","The correct answer is **B: Ngemuva kwekubusa kwa-Queen Elizabeth II**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lonakekela Ndvunankhulu Julia Gillard ngesikhatsi kuchubeka umkhankhaso welukhetfo wanga-2010 watsi ukholelwa kutsi i-Australia itoba live lelibuswa ngalokukhululekile nakuphela kubusa kweNdlovukazi Elizabeth II."" This directly translates to: ""Prime Minister Julia Gillard, during the 2010 election campaign, said she believed Australia would become a republic only after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngekushesha nakungenteka** - The text doesn't suggest immediate change.
*   **C: Ingalokotsi** - The text shows Gillard has a clear opinion.
*   **D: Ngemuva kwelukhetfo** - While she said this *during* the election campaign, the timing of the republic isn't tied to the election itself, but to the Queen's reign ending.



"
Nguyiphi inhlangano lengaphansi kweluphenyo?,"The correct answer is **D: I-The Oversight ne-Investigations Subcommittee**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Stearns wenta luphenyo lwekutsi imali yentela kungenteka yini kutsi isentjentiselwa kukhishwa kwetisu kusetjentiswa i-Planned Parenthood emsebentini wakhe njengasihlalo we**Likomidi Lelingaphansi Kwalelibhekile naleliPhenyako**...""

This directly identifies the committee conducting the investigation.  While other organizations are *mentioned* in relation to the investigation, they are not the entities *doing* the investigation.
"
Cliff Stearns ungumholi wayiphi ikomidi?,"The correct answer is **D: I-The Oversight ne-Investigations Subcommittee**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Stearns wenta luphenyo lwekutsi imali yentela kungenteka yini kutsi isentjentiselwa kukhishwa kwetisu kusetjentiswa i-Planned Parenthood emsebentini wakhe njengasihlalo we**Likomidi Lelingaphansi Kwalelibhekile naleliPhenyako**, lengaphansi kweLikomidi leHouse Energy and Commerce.""  This translates to ""Stearns conducted an investigation into whether tax dollars could be used for abortions using Planned Parenthood in his role as chairman of **The Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee**, which fell under the House Energy and Commerce Committee.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I-The House Energy ne-Commerce Committee:** While the subcommittee is *under* this committee, Stearns led the *subcommittee*, not the full committee.
*   **B: I-The Komen Foundation:** The Komen Foundation is the subject of the investigation, not where Stearns held a leadership position.
*   **C: I-Planned Parenthood:** Planned Parenthood is the entity being investigated, not Cliff Stearns' position.



"
"Ngekusho kwesicephu saseSwitzerland, yini lengazange yenteke kulomfati waseSwitzerland?","The correct answer is **A: Imphahla yakhe lebeyebiwe yatfolakala** (Her stolen belongings were recovered).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...bantfu labahlanu labadlwengule lowesimame waseSwiss batfola makhalekhukhwini kanye nekhompyutha yakhe lephatfwako"" - which translates to ""...five criminals stole a Swiss woman's mobile phone and her personal laptop"".  It then states they *found* the phone and laptop – meaning the stolen items were *recovered*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Wabulawa** - The text doesn't mention the woman being killed.
* **C: Wagagadlelwa bantfu labangu-5** - The text states she was *robbed by* 5 people, not kidnapped by them.
* **D: Lucingo lwakhe nangcondvomshini lophatfwako kwebiwa** - While her laptop was stolen, the text doesn't mention anything about her identity documents (lucingo) being stolen.

Nguyiphi inkapani leyaklonyeliswa nge-Taiwan Sustainable Award nga-2007?,"The correct answer is **C: I-ASUS**.

The text explicitly states: ""...i-ASUS itfole umklomelo kuyi-2007 Taiwan Sustainable Award levela Kumphatsi weRepublic of China."" ( ...ASUS received the 2007 Taiwan Sustainable Award from the Republic of China government.)"
Iyini i-ASUS Eee PC?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngcondvomshini lophatfwako** (which translates to ""portable computer"" or ""laptop"").

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states ""I-ASUS Eee PC, phambilini ikhiphe emanani okonga emhlaba wonkhe kanye netindlela tekusebenta..."" (ASUS Eee PC, previously released cost-effective prices and operating methods...) and continues to describe it in relation to the computer industry. This clearly identifies it as a type of computer.  The other options (smartphone, tablet, pager) are different types of devices.



"
Ngubani labekanesandla ekulahlekeni kwetimphepha teliposi?,"The correct answer is **C: Umfana** (The boy).

The passage explicitly states that a boy was found hiding 600 pieces of mail, including the missing New Year's cards. This makes him directly responsible for the lost mail.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tisebenti taseposini** (Post office workers) - The passage doesn't indicate the workers were involved, only that the post office investigated.
*   **B: Licembu letakhamuti tase-Obanazawa** (Obanazawa police force) - They investigated, but didn't *cause* the loss.
*   **D: Bemsakato** (Residents) - They were the *victims* of the loss, not the cause.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngubani lowacolisa mayelana netimphepha letalahleka?","The correct answer is **B: Ngumfana** (A boy).

The text states: ""umfana ufihle tincwadzi tebantfu letingu-600..."" which translates to ""a boy hid people's documents, including..."". This directly identifies the boy as the one who revealed the location of the missing items.



"
Kunini lapho Del Potro asingatsa khona inkinga yakhe yelihlombe?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngesethi yesibili**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""De Potro ube sematfubeni esiwombeni sesibili, kepha loku bekudzinga sikhashana sekuphumula ngemuva kwekuhlanganisa 6-6. Potro welashwa lihlombe ngaso leso sikhatsi futsi wakhona kubuyela achubeke nemdlalo.""

This directly translates to: ""De Potro was on the court in the second set, but this required a short break after tying 6-6. Potro received treatment for his shoulder at that time and was able to return to continue the match.""

Therefore, he received treatment for his shoulder *during* the second set.



"
Waba yini umphumela welikhefu le-tie yekucala?,"The correct answer is **A: Kwehlulwa Murray ngesethi yekucala** (Murray lost the first set).

Here's why:

The text states ""Murray wehluleka esigabeni sekucala"" which directly translates to ""Murray lost the first set."" The rest of the passage details what happened *after* the first set.
"
"Njengobe kushiwo kulesicephu, ngubani ngalokucondzile lowaba nekuhlangana nesigulane?","The correct answer is **B: Bantfwana**.

Here's why:

The text states: """"Namuhla sitfole kutsi bantfwana labasafundza sikolwa bakile batsintsana nalesiguli."""" which translates to ""Today we find that schoolchildren are sick with this disease.""  This directly indicates that schoolchildren (bantfwana) are the ones who have encountered the illness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umbusi (The Leader/Governor Perry):** Perry is *reporting* on the situation, not experiencing it himself.
*   **C: Tikhulu tase-Texas (Texas officials):** They are involved in the response, but not stated to be sick.
*   **D: Takhamuti tasendzaweni (Local authorities):**  Similar to Texas officials, they are responding, not infected.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngusiphi sicinisekiso umbusi langazange alisho nakakhuluma netakhamuti taseTexas?","The correct answer is **D: Lenkinga ayisiyinkhulu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Perry *said* the issue *is* huge (""Lendzaba lena yinkhulu."").** Therefore, he did *not* say it wasn't a big deal.
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **A: Luhlelo lusebenta kahle** - Perry explicitly states he wants to ""ciniseka kutsi luhlelo lwetfu lusebenta ngendlela lefanele"" (make sure our system is working properly).
    * **B: Entelwa kugcina sive siphephile** - The entire point of the statement is about protecting people (""kutsi kuvikelwe bantfu"").
    * **C: Akulungele kubhekana nensayeya** - Perry said Texas is well-prepared (""Kunetindzawo letimbalwa emhlabeni letilungiselelwe kuhlangabetana nenselele lephakanyiswe kulesimo."").

Therefore, the only thing Perry did *not* say was that the problem wasn't a big deal."
Ngumuphi umtfombo wetindzaba letihlekisako lowentiwa bafundzi lababili base-UW?,"The correct answer is **D: I-The Onion**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Kudzala ngembi kwe-The Daily Show ne-The Colbert Report, Heck naJohnson babone kushicilelwa kwetindzaba—nekubika kwetindzaba—uma basesebafundi e-UW nga-1988. Kusukela lasungulwa, **liphephandzaba i-The Onion** libe liphephandzaba lelidvumile...""

This directly links Heck and Johnson to the founding and observation of *The Onion* while they were students at UW. While the passage mentions *The Daily Show* and *The Colbert Report*, it says they *observed* the publication of *The Onion*.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokungazange kufakwe etindzabeni letihlekisako lokutsiwa yi-The Onion?","The correct answer is **A: I-atlas yemhlaba**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""Umhlaba Wetfu Lolibele"" which translates to ""Our Dumb World"" – **a map of the world** published by The Onion. The other options are all mentioned as formats or platforms used by The Onion:

* **B: Lifilimu** - Not directly mentioned.
* **C: Likhasi le-inthanethi** - The passage says they have a website.
* **D: Luhlelo loluphrintiwe** - The passage states it's a printed newspaper.

Therefore, the atlas/map is the one thing from the options that *is* actually a product of The Onion, not something they haven’t done."
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lebeyigadvwe maphoyisa?","The correct answer is **C: Lisango le-The Downing Street**.

The passage states that police were guarding ""the entrance to Downing Street"". This directly answers the question of what the police were guarding. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I-Trafalgar Square** - The protest *passed through* Trafalgar Square, but wasn't guarded there.
* **B: I-The Spring Forum** - This is the meeting the protesters were heading *to*, not what the police were guarding.
* **D: Emagumbi e-The Grand Connaught** - This is where the forum was held, but the police were guarding Downing Street.



"
Kungabani sikhatsi lapho emaphoyisa acele khona babhikishi kutsi bahambe kuze kugwenywe kutsi phindze kugcwale timoti?,"The correct answer is **D: Nga-11:20**.

The text states: ""Nga-11:20, liphoyisa licele babhikishi kutsi basuke bame endleleni yekuhamba abantfu..."" which translates to ""At 11:20, police asked protesters to move from the road...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cishe ngabo-11:00** - The protest *started* around 11:00, but the police request came later.
* **B: Nga-11:29** - The protest had already moved by 11:29.
* **C: Ngembi kwa-11:00** - This is vague and doesn't match the specific timing given in the text.



"
Ngukuphi lokuliciniso mayelana nelucwaningo lolwentiwa nguDokotela Ehud Ur?,"The correct answer is **D: Lamanye emagundvwane labekete sifo sashukela sekanaso** (Some of the mice that were given diabetes recovered from the disease).

Here's why:

*   The text states: """"""Nyalo sesinemagundvwane lanetinyanga letine budzala lasekete shukela labekanawo shukela"""""""""" which translates to ""Now some of the mice that were given diabetes recovered from diabetes"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text specifically states the findings are *not* related to people with Type 1 diabetes.
*   **B:** While the text mentions mice being *given* diabetes, it doesn't say they naturally contracted it.
*   **C:** Dr. Ur is generally optimistic about a cure for diabetes, but the text doesn't say *this specific research* is expected to lead to a cure. It notes the research is in its early stages.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini Dokotela Ur lanekungabata ngayo?","The correct answer is **A: Kutsi lemiphumela iyasebenta yini kubantfu labanesifo sashukela lesiLuhlobo 1**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that Dr. Ur cautioned that the findings ""do not apply to people with Type 1 diabetes."" This directly indicates his concern is whether the research results are relevant to individuals *with* Type 1 diabetes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kutsi likhambi likhona** - The text doesn't focus on whether a cure exists generally, but specifically on the applicability of this research to Type 1 diabetes.
*   **C: Imibono yalabanye bocwepheshe mayelana nelikhambi** - The text doesn't discuss the opinions of other experts.
*   **D: Kutsi emagundvwane lete sifo sashukela atohlala ete yini** - The text doesn't mention how long mice with diabetes live.



"
Ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako langakuchazi kahle kuphahlateka kweNdiza CG4684?,"The correct answer is **D: Imetamo yekutfola lapho lendiza iphahlatekele khona yaphazanyiswa simo selitulu** (The search for where the plane crashed was hampered by the weather).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Lolucwaningo luphatanyiswe ngulesimo selitulu lesingasisihle lesiphatamise nalokuhlala kwendiza."" (The search was complicated by the bad weather that hampered the landing of the plane). This directly connects the weather to difficulties in finding the crash site.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lendiza yacale yangakhoni kuhlala ngesizatfu sesimo selitulu** (The plane failed to land due to the weather) - While the weather contributed, the text says it was *already* on the ground and preparing for a second attempt when it disappeared.
* **B: Lendiza yaphahlateka endzaweni lechele kakhulu** (The plane crashed in a very remote area) - The text mentions it's in a forested area and difficult to access, but doesn't emphasize extreme remoteness as the primary issue.
* **C: Lendiza yetama kuhlala tikhatsi letintsatfu ngembi kwekuphahlateka** (The plane attempted to land three times before the crash) - The text states it was preparing for a *second* landing attempt.



"
Yini leyabangela Indiza CG4684 kutsi iyekele kuhlala?,"The correct answer is **D: Simo selitulu besisibi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lolucwaningo luphatanyiswe ngulesimo selitulu lesingasisihle lesiphatamise nalokuhlala kwendiza."" This translates to ""The investigation is complicated by the bad weather that affected the aircraft's landing.""

This directly indicates that the bad weather was a factor in why the plane couldn't land as intended.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bekungangeneki endzaweni lakufanele ihlale khona** - While the plane couldn't *reach* the landing spot, the text says the weather *affected* the landing, not just that it was inaccessible.
*   **B: Bekunaletinye tindiza letinyenti ngembi kwe-CG4684** - The text doesn't mention any other aircraft.
*   **C: Lendiza yaphambukiswa yayiswa eKokoda** - The text says the plane *was supposed* to land at Kokoda, not that it was diverted from there."
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako laliciniso mayelana nalokwehlela Franciszek Kowal?","The correct answer is **A: Wakhona kwephula lifasitelo** (A window was broken).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lelinye lalamafasitela lagcina liphukile, futsi bacala kuphuma ngalelifasitelo"" which translates to ""One of the windows finally broke, and they started to exit through that window.""  This directly confirms that a window was broken.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Akazange alimale** (He was not injured) - The text doesn't mention if Franciszek was injured or not.
* **C: Wephula situlu lapho etama kuphuma** (He broke his leg when trying to get out) - The text doesn't mention any injuries, let alone a broken leg.
* **D: Walimanala lapho etama kwephula lifasitelo** (He was injured when trying to break the window) - Again, no mention of injuries.



"
Kungani kumatima kukala umonakala longabangwa Siphepho Lokutsiwa Ngu-Danielle?,"The correct answer is **C: Lesiphepho sikhashane nekufika emhlabeni.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Njengoba siphepho sikhashane nekuwa kwemhlabatsi, kuhlala kumantima kubona umonakalo lowentekile eMelika noma eCaribbean.""  This directly translates to ""As the hurricane approaches landfall, it is always difficult to predict the damage it will cause in America or the Caribbean.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the potential for it to become a major hurricane is mentioned, it doesn't explain *why* damage is hard to predict.
* **B:** Scientists *have* made assessments about the wind speed, but this doesn’t explain the difficulty in predicting damage.
* **D:**  Its proximity to Miami is a detail about its location, not the reason damage prediction is difficult.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako langasilo liciniso mayelana neSiphepho Lokutsiwa Ngu-Danielle?","The correct answer is **A: Umonakala wase e-Caribbean awatiwa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kuhlala kumantima kubona umonakalo lowentekile eMelika noma eCaribbean"" - This means scientists are *watching for potential damage* in the Caribbean, not that no damage is expected.  Therefore, saying no damage is known is false.

Let's look at why the other options are true, according to the text:

* **B: Sakheka eLwandle I-Atlantic** - The text directly states, ""sakheka e-Atlantic Ocean.""
* **C: Singashintja sibe sivunguvungu lesinemandla** -  ""Bososayensi ku-National Hurricane Center bacabanga kutsi Danielle utawucina abe siphepho ngeLesitsatfu"" means they think it *could become* a hurricane.
* **D: Sisedvute nekufika emhlabeni** - The passage implies this by discussing its location and potential for damage.

"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lokunconywa kutsi yenteke ngaleligciwane ngembi kwekutsi libe lubhubhane lwemhlaba wonkhe?","The correct answer is **A: Kufanele anciphe emandla alo ekubulala** (It should have its killing power reduced).

Here's why:

The passage states that research shows the virus *can be diminished in severity* so it doesn't cause a pandemic. ""Diminished in severity"" means reducing its ability to cause serious illness or death – its killing power.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Timphawu kufanele ahlale angabi nemandla** (Symptoms should remain mild) - While mild symptoms are part of reduced severity, the core issue is the virus's ability to *cause harm*, not just the symptom level.
* **C: Kufanele libambe bantfu labanyenti** (It should infect many people) - A pandemic requires widespread infection *and* serious illness.  More infections aren't helpful if the virus remains deadly.
* **D: Bantfwana kufanele babe netimphawu talo** (Children should have symptoms) - The passage specifically notes the children *didn't* have symptoms, and this is part of the reason for hope.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, lesishingishane sikhashane kangakanani neFujian?","The correct answer is **D: Emakhilomitha langu-77**.

The text states the eye of Mokarat was ""cishe ngemakhilomitha langemashumi lasikhombisa"" (approximately seventy kilometers) from Fujian province.  Therefore, 77 kilometers is the closest and most accurate answer.



"
Ngubani lowabingelela George W. Bush nakefika e-Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng naLee Hsien Loong**.

Here's why:

The text states that George W. Bush was ""welcomed by Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng and he discussed trade and security issues with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.""  Therefore, both Wong Kan Seng and Lee Hsien Loong welcomed him.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndvunankhulu (Prime Minister)** - While he *did* meet with the Prime Minister, he wasn't solely welcomed by him.
*   **B: Tetsameli (Ambassador)** - The text doesn't mention an ambassador.
*   **D: Lisekela Landvunakhulu (Deputy Prime Minister)** - While the Deputy Prime Minister *did* welcome him, Lee Hsien Loong also played a role in the welcome.



"
Mengameli ukhulume nini ngekwandza kwetekutsengiselana kwe-Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Kulandzela kwehluleka kwakhe elukhetfweni lwasekhatsi nemnyaka**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ngemuva kweliviki ehlulekile elukhetfweni, Bush utjele labebamlalele ngekwenwetjwa kwetentsengiselwano e-Asia."" This translates to ""After a difficult week on the campaign trail, Bush told listeners about the importance of trade in Asia.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nakafika eSingapore** - He spoke *after* the failed week, not upon arrival.
*   **B: NakanaWong Kan Seng** - He spoke to a wider audience, not specifically to Wong Kan Seng.
*   **D: Ekhatsi nekuhambela kwakhe kweliviki e-Asia** - While related, the key trigger for his speech was the failed week, not just the trip itself.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungumgomo wahulumende?","The correct answer is **B: Kutfola tinkalishi letingu-300**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lomunye 300 ungenta lelinani libe tincola letingu-1,300..."" which translates to ""One 300 will increase this number to 1,300...""  This clearly indicates a government policy of *providing* 300 grants.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuchasa tinkalishi letengetiwe angakendluli March kulomnyaka:** (Cancelling grants before March this year) - The passage doesn't mention cancelling grants.
* **C: Kutfola tinkalishi letengetiwe letingu-1,300:** (Receiving 1,300 grants) - The passage says the 300 *adds up to* 1,300 *total* grants, not that individuals receive 1,300.
* **D: Kunciphisa kugcwala kakhulu kwetinkalishi:** (Reducing the overcrowding of grants) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
Yini lemenyetelwe nguhulumende?,"The correct answer is **C: Bahlela kuchasa ngetinkalishi letengetiwe letingu-1,300**.

Here's why:

The text states the government promised to pay for 1,300 students' tuition (kutsenga kwekutfwala) using 300 million (lomunye 300 ungenta lelinani libe tincola letingu-1,300).  This directly translates to a plan to cover tuition for 1,300 students.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Luhlelo lwekuchasa ngetinkalishi letengetiwe letingu-300** - The 300 million is *used to fund* the 1,300 students, it's not the number of students being funded directly.
*   **B: Batimisele kutsi balungise inkinga yetinkalishi** - While addressing the tuition issue is a form of fixing a problem, the text specifically details *how* they are fixing it (funding students), not just a general commitment.
*   **D: Inkinga yekugcwala kakhulu itawulungiswa angakendluli March** - The text doesn't mention anything about overcrowding or a deadline of March.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwatiswa lokwatiwako?","The correct answer is **A: Lizinga lengoti selincishisiwe** (The level of threat has been reduced).

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""...lokuncipha kwalelizinga lalesisongo kulesimatima..."" which directly translates to ""...the reduction in the level of threat at this time...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sekute ingoti** (The threat is over) - P explicitly says the *reduction* in threat doesn't mean the threat is *gone*.
* **C: Kulindzeleke kuhlasela** (An attack is expected) - P initially suggests an attack *could* be imminent, but then focuses on the *change* in threat level.
* **D: Betebunhloli bakucinisekisile kutsi kuhlasela kutawuba kubi kakhulu** (Intelligence has confirmed the attack will be very bad) -  This information isn't present in the passage.  P only discusses the *possibility* and *level* of the threat, not its severity as confirmed by intelligence.



"
Ngumaphi emavi langasilo liciniso mayelana nemibhikisho?,"The correct answer is **A: Ikhomishane yebungameli ibe yimphendulo emibhikishweni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lekhomishini bekuyiphendvula ngekwandza kwemibhikisho yekuvukela umbuso yaseMartell..."" This directly translates to ""The commission was a response to the anti-Martelly protests...""  This means the commission *reacted to* the protests, it wasn't the cause of them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Lukhetfo lebelusolo lungenteki lubangele lemibhikisho** - The text states the protests were caused by the *failure* to hold an election that was *supposed* to happen in 2011. So it was the failed election causing the protest.
*   **C: Lemibhikisho beyifuna kutsi i-CEP yangaphambilini isule** - The text doesn't mention the protests demanding the previous CEP resign.
*   **D: Lemibhikisho beyineludlame ngaletinye tikhatsi** - The text says the protests were violent (""Lokubhikisha lokuneludlame""). This is *true* according to the text, not a falsehood.



"
Ngubani lowancoma kutsi i-CEP legcinile yesule?,"The correct answer is **D: Emalunga e-CEP ancome loku ngekwawo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lecouncil inemalunga layimfica."" which translates to ""The council had its members approve it.""  This means the members of the CEP themselves approved the decision to dismiss Martelly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: NguMartelly:** The passage says Martelly was *dismissed* by the CEP, he didn't approve it.
*   **B: Babhikishi:** The passage says protests *led* to the commission considering replacing the CEP, but doesn't say the protesters approved the decision.
*   **C: Ikhomishane yebungameli:** The commission *considered* replacing the CEP, but the text says the CEP members themselves made the decision to dismiss Martelly.



"
"Ngekwalamavi, yini lengasekelwa yi-USA Gymnastics kulandzela kuhlukunyetwa kwebasubatsi nguNassar?","The correct answer is **C: Lushintjo loludzingekako ngekhatsi kwalenhlangano**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Betemdlalo wemagymnastics baseMelika kanye neUSOC banemgomomunye wekwenta lomdlalo naleminye uphephe kuze bantfu labawudlalako baphephe bakhone kufeza emaphupho abo."" and ""Betekujima eMelika iyalamukela noma ngabe nguluphi lushintjo lolufanele naloludzingekako.""  This directly translates to USA Gymnastics supporting *necessary changes within the organization* to improve safety and prevent future abuse.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kusulwa kwesitifiketi (Revoking certifications):** While this might be *a part* of changes, the passage doesn't specifically highlight it as the primary support.
*   **B: Kwenta kutsi kube nesimo lesikhombisa kuba nemandla (Creating a show of strength):** The passage focuses on actual change and safety, not just appearances.
*   **D: Luphenyo lolutimele (Independent investigation):** While they support the investigation, the main point is their commitment to implement changes *based* on the findings.



"
"Ngekwalamavi, uyini umgomo loyinhloko we-USA Gymnastics ne-United States Olympic Committee kuya phambili?","The correct answer is **D: Kukhutsata ktusi kube nesimo lesiphephile kubasubatsi** (To ensure a safe environment for athletes).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that both USA Gymnastics and the USOC want to make the sport safer for all athletes so they can achieve their dreams. They are supporting investigations and accepting changes to prevent abuse like that of Larry Nassar from happening again. While addressing Nassar's actions (A) is *part* of the solution, the overarching goal is preventative and focused on athlete safety.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuveta kuhlukumeta lokwentiwa ngu-Larry Nassar** (To avenge the harm done by Larry Nassar) - While they acknowledge the harm, the focus is on preventing future harm, not revenge.
*   **B: Kutsatsa tinyatselo tekusula sitifiketi** (To implement certification measures) - The passage doesn't mention certification.
*   **C: Kutsatsa tinyatselo teluphenyo lolutimele** (To implement independent investigations) - They *support* investigations, but that's a method to achieve the larger goal of safety, not the goal itself.



"
Lomkhumbi bewulibhekise kuphi ngesikhatsi kwenteka lesehlakalo? ,"The correct answer is **C: EPalawan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""lomkhumbi bowusendleleni yawo uya e-Puerto Princesa in Palawan."" This translates to ""the ship was on its way to Puerto Princesa in Palawan."" Therefore, the ship was heading *towards* Palawan when the incident occurred.



"
Ngukuphi lokungasilo liciniso mayelana nalomkhumbu lokukhulunywe ngawo kulesicephu?,"The correct answer is **B: Utinte ePalawan**.

Here's why:

The text states the ship was *en route* (on its way) to Puerto Princesa in Palawan, but it doesn't say it *is based* in Palawan. It's currently heading there, but its home port is Sasebo, Nagasaki in Japan.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

*   **A: Bewulibangise ePuerto Princesa** - The text says the ship is ""on its way to Puerto Princesa""
*   **C: Ngumkhumbi lobitwa ngekutsi yi-mine countermeasures ship** - The text mentions the spokesperson is using methods to combat the ship, implying it's a ship used to find and neutralize mines.
*   **D: Wabelwe i Seventh Fleet ye U.S. Navy** - The text explicitly states ""Yabelwe e-U.S Navy's Seventh Fleet"".



"
Ngubani lowasho lamavi mayelana nemasotja aseMelika?,"The correct answer is **A: NguDonald Trump**.

The text explicitly states that Donald Trump made the statement regarding the withdrawal of US troops from Syria.
"
"Ngekwalamavi, nguliphi live lelitsetse umsebenti wekugadza titfunjwa letilwako?","The correct answer is **D: ITurkey**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""I-Turkey ingatsatsa kugadza bantfu labalwela i-ISIS lababanjiwe..."" which translates to ""Turkey will start to guard the ISIS fighters who are prisoners..."" This directly indicates Turkey is taking on the responsibility of guarding the prisoners.



"
Yini lokukholelwa kutsi iyimbangela yalengoti?,"The correct answer is **B: Umlilo lonemandla** (An intense fire).

The text specifically states: ""kukholelwa kutsi ibangelwe ngumlilo lonemandla"" which translates to ""it is believed to be caused by an intense fire.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Indzawo lembi** (Bad location) - While the location is mountainous, the text doesn't say the location *caused* the incident.
*   **C: Indzawo letintsaba** (Mountainous area) - The location is mentioned, but not as the cause.
*   **D: Simo selitulu lesibi** (Bad weather) - Bad weather hampered the *search* efforts, but wasn’t the cause of the incident itself.



"
Ingoti yenteke kuluphi luhlobo lwendzawo?,"The correct answer is **D: Lenetintsaba** (Mountainous).

The text states ""Lengoti yenteke etulu emgwaceni losentsabeni"" which translates to ""The incident occurred high on the mountain road"". This clearly indicates a mountainous area.



"
Yini tikhulu letinelitsemba layo njengemphumela wetikhukhula?,"The correct answer is **A: Kubuyiselwa kwendvundvuma yesihlabatsi** (Restoration of the ecosystem).

Here's why:

The passage states that authorities *hope* the increased water levels will be *enough to restore the degraded land and river*. This directly links the hope to the ecosystem's recovery.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kwakhiwa kwemabhishi** (Construction of beaches) - The passage states beaches were *created as a result of* the dam, not that it's a hoped-for outcome of the releases.
* **C: Linani lelikhulako lema-humpback chubs** (Increased number of humpback chubs) - The humpback chub is *endangered*, not increasing.
* **D: Tindzawo letengetiwe tetilwane tasendle** (Designated wildlife areas) - The passage doesn't mention designating wildlife areas; it talks about habitat loss and potential restoration.



"
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokwatsintfwa unomphela kwakhiwa kwelidamu?,"The correct answer is **B: Ema-Humpback chubs**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that two fish species are no longer found, and two are endangered *including* the humpback chub, as a direct result of the dam's construction. The other options are mentioned, but not as the primary focus of the impact described.

*   **A: Tindvundvuma tesihlabatsi (Soil structures)** - While the text mentions sediment build-up, it doesn't say these were *lost* due to the dam.
*   **C: Tindzawo tetilwane tasendle (Wildlife habitats)** -  The passage says habitats were *created* by the reservoir, not lost.
*   **D: Kusabalala kwenkhucunkhucu (Spread of weeds)** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngubani lowacwayisa i-United States ngekuhlalelwa lokungase kwenteke?","The correct answer is **A: Bontsamolukhuni baseSomalia**.

Here's why:

The text states the U.S. issued a warning about ""bantfu betepolitiki labecisako eSomalia"" (radical Somali politicians) planning attacks.  Therefore, the U.S. is warning *about* Somali politicians, not accusing the other options.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Lihhovisi lelincusa laseTopiya** - The text mentions Ethiopia as a potential target, not the source of the threat.
*   **C: Ngumtfombo longatiwa** - The text doesn't mention a specific individual.
*   **D: Ngumtfomba loseKenya** - Kenya is mentioned as a potential target, not the source of the threat.

Ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako lalichaza kahle lichinga labontsamolukhuni lekuhlasela lokusolwa kutsi likhona?,"The correct answer is **C: Kuchumisa emabhomu netichumane emaveni lamabili**.

Here's why:

The text states the warning is about plans to detonate bombs to attack **both** Kenya and Ethiopia (""kuhlaselwe iKenya neTopiya"").  Therefore, the plan involves bombs in *two* locations. The text also mentions the use of explosives (""emabhomu"") and potentially other devices (""tichumane"").

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuchumisa emabhomu netichumane eveni linye** - This says ""one location"" which is incorrect.
*   **B: Kuchumisa emabhomu emaveni lamabili** - This doesn't mention the possible use of ""tichumane"" (other devices).
*   **D: Kuchumisa emabhomu eveni linye** - This says ""one location"" which is incorrect.



"
Ngumuphi kulabantfu labalandzelako longasiye ummeli?,"The correct answer is **D: NguMakis Triantafylopoulos**.

Here's why:

* **Petros Mantouvalos** is explicitly stated as a member of Parliament *and* a representative (ummeli).
* **Sakis Kechagioglou** and **George Nikolakopoulos** are described as lawyers (abameli).
* **Makis Triantafylopoulos** is described as a presenter on a TV show (""intsatseli lenguMakis Triantafylopoulos eluhlelweni lwakhe loludvumile kuThelevishini lelitsi """"Zoungla"""" ku-Alpha TV""). He is not mentioned as being a representative or lawyer.



"
Nguliphi licembu lebantfu lelingabalwa njengencenye yelihlazo lelikhona kubetemtsetfo baseGreece?,"The correct answer is **B: Emajaji**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...ihlazo lelikhulu endzabeni yetemtsetfo taseGreece livele ngesikhatsi kwenekwa obala tindlela tekutiphatsa lebetentiwa ngabehluleli, abameli, nebameli bemafa emkhatsini waleminyaka leyengcile."" 

""Behluleli"" translates to judges. The passage directly links the scandal to the conduct of judges (along with representatives and lawyers), making them a key part of the disgrace within the Greek justice system.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Beluleki betemtsetfo (Lawyers):** While lawyers are mentioned, the passage emphasizes judges specifically in the context of the scandal's impact.
*   **C: Tintsatseli (Swindlers/Fraudsters):**  The passage discusses swindlers being *caught* (Kechagioglou, Nikolakopoulos, Triantafylopoulos), but they *cause* the scandal, they aren't part of the shame *within* the judicial system itself.
*   **D: Bameli (Representatives/Politicians):** The example of Mantouvalos shows politicians were involved, but the primary focus of the ""great disgrace"" is the actions of those *within* the justice system (judges, lawyers, and representatives of the courts).



"
INdiya ilahlekelwe mawikhethi lamangakhi?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The passage states: ""...emuva kwekulahlekelwa ngema-wicket kukaputeni waseNdiya wenta ema-runs langu-36 walahlekelwa ema-wickets langu-7 ngasekupheleni kwema-innings."" This directly translates to ""…after the Indian captain scored 36 runs, they lost 7 wickets at the end of the innings.""
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, bekangakanani emaphuzu lasetulu ema-innings?","The correct answer is **A: Ema-runs langu-70**.

The text states: ""Robin Uthappa wente ema-innings laphakheme, waba nema-runs langu-70..."" which translates to ""Robin Uthappa scored the highest innings, scoring 70 runs..."" 

Therefore, the highest score in the innings was 70 runs."
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungasiyo imbangela yekukhungatseka kwa-Adam Cuerden?,"The correct answer is **B: Kususwa kwebuciko baseWales** (The removal of Wales' artwork).

Here's why:

The passage states Adam Cuerden is upset because of being ""censored"" while speaking to Wikinews, and specifically mentions Wales ""simply lied from the start."" The passage then details how Wales initially claimed the censorship was due to unspecified reasons and then later implied Cuerden was being difficult. This directly relates to the removal of Cuerden's artwork by Wales.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umgomo lomusha wesayithi lomayelana netintfo letitsintsa tasecansini** (The new site policy regarding sexual content) - While the policy change is *related* to the overall conflict, it's not the direct cause of Cuerden's initial upset – it’s the censorship of *his* work.
*   **C: Kungalalelwa yiWales** (Not being listened to by Wales) - The passage mentions Wales not listening as a continuation of the problem, but not the root cause.
*   **D: Emanga mayelana nembangela yekususwa kwalobuciko** (Lies about the reason for the removal of the artwork) - The lie is a *part* of the problem, but the removal of the artwork is the core issue that triggered Cuerden’s frustration.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini leyasuswa kulesayithi?","The correct answer is **B: Tintfo letimayelana nekuya ecansini**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...kuhlelele emitamweni leyentiwako nyalo yekubhala umtsetfo mayelana netitfo letiphatselene netemacansi kulewebusayithi..."" This translates to ""...leading to current efforts to write a policy regarding content related to sexuality on this widely used, permissioned news website.""

This clearly indicates that content *related to sexuality* is what's being addressed and potentially removed/regulated.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako Amir Khan langakusekeli?","The correct answer is **A: Kufaka labasikati labalwako kuma-Olimpiki (Including female boxers in the Olympics)**.

Here's why:

The text states Amir Khan believes ""bantfu besimame akukafaneli balwe"" (women shouldn't fight). This directly implies he *doesn't* support women participating in combat sports like boxing at the Olympics. He supports the competition itself (2012 London Olympics) and supports competitors, but not women *boxing* in it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Timbangi letiMangisi (British competitors):** He explicitly states he will support British competitors.
* **C: Imibono yebantfu labasikati (Opinions of women):** He expresses *his own* opinion, not a rejection of women's opinions.
* **D: Kutsi i-London ibambe imidlalo yema-Olimpiki (That London hosts the Olympic Games):** He explicitly supports the 2012 London Olympics.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokutawusekelwa ngu-Amir Khan ngisho nangetulu kwemibono yakhe?","The correct answer is **C: Ema-Olimpiki a-2012**.

Here's why:

The passage states Amir Khan ""said he would support those competing in the 2012 British Olympic Games.""  While he expressed a personal belief against women fighting, he *specifically* stated his support for the 2012 Olympics participants. The other options are not directly supported by the text.

* **A: Labasikati labalwako (Female fighters)** - He expressed a *belief* about them, not support.
* **B: Timbangi takhe tangema-Olimpiki a-2004 (His 2004 Olympic opponents)** - The passage doesn't mention his support for them.
* **D: Labanye labatfola timendlela telitfusi (Other silver medalists)** - No support for them is mentioned.



"
Peter Lenz wafa nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Esibhedlela** (At the hospital).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...wamikiswa esibhedlela sendzawo lapho afela khona ngekuhamba kwesikhatsi."" which translates to ""...he was taken to a local hospital where he died after a while.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngesikhatsi atilungiselela** (While preparing) - He died *after* the accident, not while preparing.
*   **B: Ngemuva kwekuwa esidududwini** (After falling on the track) - He died *after* being hit, and after receiving medical attention.
*   **D: Ngesikhatsi anetisebenti tetemphilo** (While with medical personnel) - He died at the hospital *after* the initial medical attention.



"
Ngubani Xavier Zayat?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngulomunye losemcudzelwaneni** (He is one of the competitors).

The text states that Peter Lenz was hit by Xavier Zayat, who was another competitor in the race. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sisebenti setemphilo** (He is a healthcare worker) - The text says healthcare workers provided aid *after* the accident, not that Zayat was one.
* **C: Ngudokotela** (He is a doctor) - Same reasoning as above.
* **D: Ngumlandzeli** (He is a fan) - The text clearly establishes Zayat as a racer, not a spectator.



"
Kukusiphi simo lapho umgibeli wendiza lowesabako kungenteka khona kutsi azuze ngekucondza indlela indiza lesebenta ngayo?,"The correct answer is **B: Nangabe kwesaba kwakhe kundiza kubangelwa kwesaba lokungatiwa**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...kucondza indlela tindiza letisebenta ngayo nekutsi kwentekani nawusendizeni kungabasita bancobe kwesaba lokusekelwe etintfweni labangatati...""  This directly translates to ""understanding how planes work and what happens on a flight can help them overcome fear based on *irrational beliefs*.""  Fear of the unknown (irrational beliefs) is the key here.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nangabe lomgibeli anemahloni ngekwesaba kwakhe:** The passage says it's *not* something to be ashamed of, but knowing you're afraid doesn't automatically help you overcome it.
* **C: Nangabe umgibeli angahambisani nato tonkhe tinhlobo tetekutfutsa:**  This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Nangabe kwesaba kwakhe kuyimbangela yetintfo letibuhlungu letingahlobene nekundiza:** This suggests the fear stems from something *outside* of the flight itself, which isn't what the passage addresses.

"Ngalokusekelwe kulesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako umuntfu lohambako lokhatsateka kakhulu ngemali lokufanele ayente ekugcineni?","The correct answer is **C: Kucatsanisa imali etinkapanini letehlukahlukene tekuhamba (Comparing prices from different travel companies)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that prices for the same flight can vary significantly. It *specifically* recommends comparing results and checking websites of airlines after booking. This implies the most financially savvy thing to do is to **compare prices across different companies** to find the best deal.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

*   **A: Kuhlola lokuniketwa tinkapani letehlukahlukene tekuhamba (Checking offers from different travel companies):** While similar to C, ""comparing prices"" is more direct and specific to saving money.
*   **B: Kubhuka ngalokucondzile nenkapani yetindiza (Booking directly with the airline):** The passage doesn't suggest this is *always* the best option, only that you should check prices after booking.
*   **D: Kuhlola likhasi le-inthanethi lenkampani yetindiza (Checking the airline's website):** This is a *part* of the process, but not the overall most important step. You need to compare across multiple sources, not just one airline's website.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini bantfu labahambako lokufanele bayente kucala kuze batfole emanani lancono etindiza nakungenteka?","The correct answer is **B: Kucatsanisa emanani kumakhasi e-inthanethi lehlukene (Comparing prices on different websites)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*kuyasita kucatsanisa imiphumela nekubuka iwebusayithi yetindizamshini nawubhukhile*” - which translates to ""...it helps to compare results and look at the airline websites when you book.""  This directly suggests checking multiple websites to find the best prices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuhlola likhasi le-inthanethi lenkampani yetindiza (Checking the airline's website):** While useful, the passage highlights the importance of looking at *multiple* websites, not just the airline's.
*   **C: Kubhuka ngalokucondzile enkapanini yetindiza (Booking directly with the airline):** The passage doesn’t suggest this is the *first* thing to do to get better prices.
*   **D: Kubhuka ngalokucondzile enkapanini yekuhamba (Booking directly with a travel agency):** This isn't directly mentioned as a key step in the passage.

Kunini lapho kudzingeka khona kutsi umngani ahambe nentfo lemikiswako?,"The correct answer is **C: Nangabe tintfo titfunyelwa njengemitfwalo lehloliwe** (If things are shipped as bonded cargo).

Here's why:

The passage states that the *only* way to get shipments through quickly is to send them as ""bonded cargo"" (liputumende lelihloliwe). It also explains the regulations prevent airlines from transporting bonded cargo without an owner present - that's where the ""friend"" (you) comes in.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nangabe tintfo titfunyelwa ngendiza** (If things are shipped by air) - While air freight is *involved* in the problem, it doesn't automatically require an escort.
* **B: Nangabe lenkapani isebentisa tindiza tayo** (If the company uses its own planes) - The passage mentions difficulties even with companies that have their own planes.
* **D: Nangabe lentfo itfunyelwa ngenkapani lenkhulu** (If the item is shipped by a large company) - Large companies still face issues, as the passage states some areas have problems even with them.

"Ngalokusekelwe kulesicephu, nawukhetsa Luhlelo Lwalabandiza Njalo kumfelandzawonye, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokufanele kuhambe embili?","The correct answer is **D: Inkapani yetindiza lengase ifake emalungelo lengetiwe**.

Here's why:

The passage states that even if you're loyal to a particular airline, the benefits within the partnership can *vary* and some airlines might offer *better* perks.  Therefore, when choosing a frequent flyer program, you should consider which airline within the alliance offers the most advantageous benefits to *you*.  ""Emalungelo lengetiwe"" means enhanced or additional benefits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Inkapani yetindiza leniketa emaphoyini lamanyenti** (The airline that offers the most flights) - While more flights can be helpful, the passage focuses on the *quality* of benefits, not just quantity of routes.
*   **B: Inkapani yetindiza lenemfelandzawonye lomkhulu** (The airline with the largest alliance) - The size of the alliance doesn’t guarantee better benefits for *you*.
*   **C: Inkapani yetindiza sikhatsi lesinyenti loyisebentisako** (The airline you most frequently fly) - The passage specifically warns against automatically choosing based on existing loyalty, as benefits can differ.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguyiphi inkapani lengase inikete emaphoyinti alabandiza njalo?","The correct answer is **B: Inkapani loyisebentisa kakhulu ngephansi kwemfelandzawonye lofanako** (The company that operates the most under the same alliance).

Here's why:

The passage states that benefits and earning opportunities *can vary* even within the same airline alliance. It suggests focusing on the airline you fly with *most often* within that alliance, as they're likely to offer the best rewards for your loyalty. 

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A & D: Inkapani leyehlukile kumfelandzawonye lowehlukile/lofanako** (A company different from a different/same alliance) - This is irrelevant as the passage is about maximizing benefits *within* an alliance.
* **C: Inkapani loyisebentisa kakhulu kumfelandzawonye lowehlukile** (The company that operates the most under a different alliance) - This is counter to the advice given - focus on airlines within *your* alliance.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumuphi kulemiva lelandzelako longase ukhinyabetwe kunatsa kakhulu tjwala?","The correct answer is **B: Kubona** (Seeing).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that excessive alcohol consumption can lead to ""**kungaboni emehlweni**"" - blindness/loss of vision.  This directly links excessive drinking to a problem with *seeing*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuva** (Hearing) - The text doesn't mention hearing loss.
*   **C: Kunambitsa** (Tasting) - The text doesn't mention taste.
*   **D: Kunikisa** (Giving) - This doesn't relate to the health consequences described in the text.

"Njengobe kushiwo kulesicephu, yini lokungenteka inciphise bungoti tjwala lobunato?","The correct answer is **B: Kunatsa timehlane letentiwe ngalokungekho emtsetfweni** (Drinking alcohol made off the record/illegally).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that drinking spirits *not* from a legitimate source (meaning illegally made) can contain dangerous impurities like methanol, which can cause blindness or even death.  This directly links to the risk of reduced alcohol safety.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kunatsa tjwala lobune-methanol** (Drinking alcohol with methanol) - While methanol *is* the danger, the passage focuses on the source of the methanol being illicitly produced alcohol.
*   **C: Kunatsa tjwala ngalokusesilinganisweni** (Drinking alcohol in moderation) - The passage mentions the dangers of *too much* alcohol, but the question asks about reducing the risk of *unsafe* alcohol.
*   **D: Kunatsa nebantfu labahlukahlukene** (Drinking with different people) - This is irrelevant to the safety of the alcohol itself.



"
Kukuphi lapho emanani etindzawo aphakeme kakhulu khona e-Amsterdam?,"The correct answer is **A: Sifundza SaseCanal**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Sifundza saseCanal (iDutch: Grachtengordel) isigodzi sengelikhulu lesi-17 leminyaka lesidvumile lesitungelete iBinnenstad yase-Amsterdam.""  It then goes on to say this area is famous and a UNESCO World Heritage site. The question asks where property values are highest, and the text strongly implies the Canal Ring is the most prominent and valuable area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While true (it *is* a UNESCO site), this doesn't answer the question about where property values are highest.
* **C:**  Binnenstad is the city center, but the text specifies the Canal Ring *within* Binnenstad as being special.
* **D:** The text states it has historical significance, but doesn't directly link that to high property values.



"
Kungani Sifundza SeCanal sikhetfwe ktusi sibe Yindzawo Yemagugu Emhlaba Ye-UNESCO?,"The correct answer is **A: Kubaluleka kwayo emlandvweni nakutemasiko** (Its importance in history and culture).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Sonkhe lesigodzi sihlelwe njenge-UNESCO Indzawo Yetintfo Temasiko Emhlabeni **ngenca yekwehluka kwaso ngekwemasiko nangekwemlandvo**..."" (The entire area is designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site **because of its cultural and historical uniqueness**).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tindzawo tayo letehlukile** (Its unique locations) - While the locations are part of what makes it special, the *reason* for UNESCO status is the cultural and historical significance.
* **C: Kutungeleta kwayo iBinnenstad** (Its location in Binnenstad) - Being *in* Binnenstad doesn't make it worthy of UNESCO status.
* **D: Kudula kwetindzawo letikuyo** (The beauty of its locations) -  Beauty is subjective and isn't the primary criterion for UNESCO designation.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokwenta kuvakashela i-Phnom Krom kube ngulokuzuzisako?","The correct answer is **D: Kuhamba ngesikebhe echibini** (Taking a boat to the lake).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Kuba mnandzi kutsi nawuvakashela khona uphindze ugibele sikebhe lesiya esichingini."" which translates to ""It is enjoyable to visit there and then take a boat to the lake.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kubona i-Tonle Sap** (Seeing Tonle Sap) - While the view of Tonle Sap is mentioned as a reason to visit, the text highlights *going to* Tonle Sap via boat as particularly enjoyable.
*   **B: Kuhamba e-Angkor Pass** (Traveling with Angkor Pass) - The Angkor Pass is a requirement for entry, not an activity that makes the visit enjoyable.
*   **C: Kubona i-Siem Reap** (Seeing Siem Reap) - The text focuses on Phnom Krom and Tonle Sap, not Siem Reap itself."
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini ledzingekako kulabavakashile kuze bangene e-Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **C: Kutfola i-Angkor Pass**.

The text explicitly states: ""I-Angkor Pass iyadzingeka kungena kulelithempeli"" (An Angkor Pass is required to enter this temple).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuncanca bendlule lithempeli i-Yasovarman** - The text mentions Yasovarman as the king who built the temple, not a requirement for entry.
* **B: Kuhamba bajikelete i-Siem Reap** - Getting to Siem Reap is implied as a starting point, but not a requirement to *enter* Phnom Krom.
* **D: Kuhamba ngesikebhe bajikelete i-Tonle Sap** - Taking a boat to the lake is suggested as an enjoyable activity *after* visiting, not a requirement for entry.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungavimbela sivakashi kutsi sivakashele i-Antarctica?","The correct answer is **A: Imali lenyenti yeluhambo** (A lot of travel money).

Here's why:

The passage states that visiting Antarctica is challenging and requires good physical strength. It also implies it's not easily accessible. While not directly stated, the demanding nature and limited season (summer only) suggest it would be an expensive trip.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Inshisekelo yekuhlola i-Ross Sea** (Interest in exploring the Ross Sea): The passage *mentions* the Ross Sea as a place people visit, not as a barrier to visiting.
*   **C: Luhlelo lwekusebenta loluvumela umuntfu kutsi avakashe ngaDecember nangaJanuary** (A work schedule that allows someone to visit in December and January): The passage states this *is* the time to visit, not a requirement that prevents people from going.
*   **D: Lizinga lelilinganiselwe lekuhamba** (Limited level of travel): The passage implies some travel is required to get to Antarctica but doesn't indicate a specific limit on travel experience. It emphasizes *physical* strength.



"
Sivakashi lesinenshisekelo yekucanca intsaba singase sivakashele yini incenye ye-Antartica?,"The correct answer is **C: I-Peninsula**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...kakhulu kugcila ePeninsula, Tichingi naseRoss Sea."" and later mentions ""...kucanca tintsaba..."" when describing activities in Antarctica.  While Tichingi and Ross Sea are mentioned alongside Peninsula, the text doesn't *specifically* link mountain climbing to those locations. Peninsula is presented as a major area for visitors and the context suggests mountain climbing is a possible activity there.



"
Kukuphi lapho amancane khona ematfuba ekutsi indzawo yekuhlola yangembi kwesikhatsi sesimanjemanje ibe khona?,"The correct answer is **A: Endzaweni lokufikeka melula kuyo** (In a less accessible area).

Here's why:

The passage states that modern research facilities are often *easier to find* in cities or educational institutions, but historically, they were *more difficult to find* – implying they were located in less accessible areas. The passage highlights that older facilities are often found where modern ones aren't, suggesting a difference in location accessibility.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Enkhabeni yelidolobha** (In the heart of the city) - The passage says modern facilities are *commonly* found here, not where older, harder-to-find ones would be.
*   **C: Endzaweni lechelile** (In a crowded area) - This doesn’t directly relate to the passage’s discussion of accessibility or historical location.
*   **D: Etakhiweni telikolishi** (In college buildings) - Again, this is where modern facilities are often *found*, not where historically difficult-to-find ones would be.



"
Kukuphi lapho sibonakudze sesimanjemanje sekwenta luhlolo lokunematfuba lamanyenti ekutsi sibekwe khona?,"The correct answer is **B: Etakhiweni tenyuvesi** (At the university building).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*tibonakudze tesimanjemanje tekucwaninga tinkhulu futsi telizinga leliphakeme futsi tingasetjentiswa etindzaweni letikhashane letinesimo lesihle.*""  This translates to ""...modern research facilities are large and of a high standard and can be used in suitable places with good conditions."" Universities are the primary locations for modern, high-standard research facilities.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Emsamo** (In the silo) - Silos are for storage, not research.
*   **C: Endzaweni yetemfundvo** (In the learning area) - Too general; doesn't specify the type of learning area suited for complex research.
*   **D: Esakhiweni lesikhulu** (In the main building) - Again, too general.  A main building could be anything.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguyiphi indzawo lokungaba kahle kuya kuyo nawufuna ibhishi lethulile?","The correct answer is **A: I-St Heliers**.

Here's why:

The text states that the beaches on Tamaki Drive (including St Heliers and Mission Bay) are often crowded with families and have many boats. However, the passage specifically highlights that the North Shore beaches are generally less crowded (""letinyenti letidvumile tindzawo tisetindzaweni letintsatfu"" - many of the popular spots are in fewer places). Therefore, St Heliers, being part of the busier Tamaki Drive area, would likely be more crowded than beaches in the North Harbour District.

While Mission Bay is also mentioned, the text doesn’t differentiate it as particularly quiet. North Harbour District is described as having many beaches, but not necessarily quiet ones. Waitemata Harbour is a general location, not a specific beach.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kukuphi lapho timo tingaba nguletiphephe khona kutsi ungabhukusha?","The correct answer is **C: E-Central Auckland**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Emabhishi aseTamaki Drive aseWaitemata Harbour, etindzaweni tasemadolobheni eMission bay neSt Heliers eCentral Auckland. Lawa ngalesinye sikhatsi kuba ngemabhishi lagcwala imindeni abe netitolo letinyenti letiba ngaselusetseni. Kubhukusha khona kuphephile.""  This directly says it's safe to swim in Central Auckland (Mission Bay & St Heliers).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E-Devonport:** While Devonport is mentioned as a location for beaches, the passage doesn't specifically state it's safe for swimming.
*   **B: E-North Harbor District:** This is a broader region, and the passage only details beaches on the North Shore, not the entire district's swim safety.
*   **D: E-Long Bay:** Long Bay is mentioned, but the passage only says the beaches *generally* have land and are safe to swim, not specifically Long Bay.

"Nawusavakashele indzawo lechazwe kulesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungatsatfwa njengalokungakafaneli?","The correct answer is **C: Kuhlekisa**.

Here's why:

*   The prompt explicitly states ""Ungenti emahlaya ngeHolocaust noma emaNazi"" (Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis). Laughing or making light of the suffering that occurred at a concentration camp is deeply disrespectful and harmful.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kutiphatsa njengalohlonipheke kakhulu** (Acting with the utmost respect) - This is *exactly* what the prompt asks for.
*   **B: Kushiya lokudvwetjiwe endzaweni letsile** (Leaving something written in the area) - While not ideal, it's not as directly offensive as mockery. It could be considered disrespectful depending on *what* is written.
*   **D: Kuhhudla sakhiwo** (Vandalizing structures) -  This is disrespectful and damaging, but the prompt focuses specifically on preventing insensitive behavior towards the *memory* of those who suffered.



"
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokuchaza tilwimi te-lingua francas?,"The correct answer is **A: Mbumbulu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a language specifically created to facilitate communication between people who speak different languages and have difficulty understanding each other.** This is the core definition of a *lingua franca*.
* **Mbumbulu** (also known as Fanagalo) is a pidgin language developed in Southern Africa for use between workers of different language groups, primarily in mining. It fits the description perfectly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Longesiyo imvelo (Not natural):** While lingua francas often *evolve* from simpler origins, they aren't necessarily inherently unnatural.  Many start as simplified versions of existing languages.
* **C: Lokwakhiwe (Constructed):**  While some constructed languages *could* become lingua francas, the passage focuses on a language *arising from need* rather than deliberate creation.
* **D: Lokuphilako (Living):** While a lingua franca can *become* a living language, the passage emphasizes its origin as a tool for communication, not a fully developed, naturally evolving language.

Ngumaphi emavi langatichazi kahle tilwimi letingasito letiyinhloko?,"The correct answer is **D: Tilwimi letakhiwe letisetjentiswa kakhulu bantfu labakhuluma tilwimi letehlukene.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""letilwimi loluvamile emkhatsini wetikhulumi, lokulwimi loluvamile lelibese likhulunywa kakhulu ngenca yesisizatfu letsite njengendlela yekuchumana emkhatsini webantfu labakhuluma letinye tilwimi.""  This directly translates to ""common languages among speakers, this common language was often spoken due to a simple reason as a way of communicating between people who speak different languages.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While true, it's a *result* of the language's function, not the definition itself.
* **B:** The passage focuses specifically on *constructed* languages (letakhiwe) used for communication, not naturally occurring ones (temvelo).
* **C:** This focuses on the *purpose* of the language, not what it *is*.

"Ngekwalesicephu, yini umuntfu lokufanele ayihlole nangabe atohamba ngemkhumbi ebusika?","The correct answer is **C: Imigomo**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Bantfu labahamba ngemkhumbi asikho sidzingo sekutsi babe nemavisa (buka imigomo)."" This means someone traveling by ship should check the **terms/conditions (Imigomo)** regarding visa requirements.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Indzawo ligumbi lelikuyo** - While the passage mentions checking cabin location, it's related to rough seas and vulnerability, not a primary requirement to check *before* traveling.
*   **B: Lokudzingekako kuze utfole i-Visa** - The passage actually states you *don't* need a visa (but to check the conditions - which is C).
*   **D: Bungako besikhatsi lesicitfwa edolobheni** - The passage mentions time in the city, but doesn't suggest you need to check how much time is allowed.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nangabe umkhumbi umuntfu lawugibele usehlobo, yini langase ayigweme?","The correct answer is **B: Kuhambe echweni**.

Here's why:

The text states that traveling on the ice (echweni) in the Baltic Sea during winter causes significant hardship for those who venture onto it. The question asks what someone traveling by ship might avoid. While the ship travels *to* Saint Petersburg, the text specifically warns against traveling *on the ice*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sikhatsi edolobheni (Time in the city)** - The text says spending time in the city is a benefit of the ship journey.
*   **C: Lokudzingekako kuze utfole i-Visa (Visa requirements)** - The text states people on the ship *don't* need visas.
*   **D: I-Saint Petersburg (Saint Petersburg)** - The ship is going *to* Saint Petersburg; it's not something to avoid.



"
Kungani siCatalan sikhatsi lesinyenti sisetjentiswa etimphawini nasetimemetelweni eBarcelona?,"The correct answer is **B: Lulwimi lwekucala lolusemtsetfweni kulelidolobha** (It is the first language historically in this city).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...tibonakalo letinyenti tikhonjiswa ngesiCatalan kuphela ngoba sakhetfwa ngekwemtsetfo njengelulimi lekucala lelisemtsetfweni."" This directly translates to ""...many signs are displayed in Catalan only because it was chosen historically as the first language of the area.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sicondvwa bantfu labanyenti kuneSpanish** (It is understood by more people than Spanish) - The passage doesn't say Catalan is *understood* by more people, only that everyone *speaks* Spanish.
* **C: Lulwimi bantfu labalunconotako eBarcelona** (It is the language people prefer in Barcelona) - The passage doesn't state preference, it states historical grounding.
* **D: Indzawo Yetitimela kanye naletinye takhiwo tesive tivakashelwa kakhulu bantfu labakhuluma siCatalan** (The metro and other city buildings are mostly visited by Catalan speakers) - The passage doesn't mention who visits these places.



"
Nguluphi kuletilwimi letilandzelako lolusetjentiswa kakhulu eTitimeleni eBarcelona nakukhishwa timemetelo letentiwa njalo?,"The correct answer is **B: SiCatalan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Timemetelo letivamile kuleMetro tentiwa kuphela ngesiCatalan"" which translates to ""Regular announcements on the Metro are made only in Catalan."" 

Therefore, Catalan is the language most used for regular announcements in Barcelona's Metro."
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokunematfuba lamanyenti ekutsi indzawo yekulala leniketa nekudla kwasekuseni futsi lesezingeni lelisetulu ikubeke embili?","The correct answer is **B: Ifenisha yakudzala leyehlukile (Unique antique furniture)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""umuntfu angatfola tintfo takanokusho tembhedze, mhlawumbe likhwilithi lelitfungwe ngetandla noma umbhedze wakadzeni lonelinani lelihle"" (a person can find valuable things for the bedroom, perhaps a skillfully crafted chair or a beautiful antique bed). It also describes a ""sakhiwo semlandvo sakadzeni lesinefenisha yakadzeni"" (a historical building with antique furniture). 

This directly highlights the importance and appeal of unique, antique furniture in elevating the experience of the lodging.  The passage focuses on the *quality* and *character* of the space, which is best represented by the furniture.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Tintfo temenyu letikhetsekile (Special menu items)** - While a good breakfast is mentioned, it's presented as one component, not the defining factor.
*   **C: Indzawo yangaphandle lenakekelwe kahle (Well-maintained outdoor area)** - The passage focuses entirely on the *indoor* experience of the lodging and doesn't mention the outdoors.
*   **D: I-WiFi lenesivinini lesisetulu (High-speed WiFi)** - Modern amenities aren't mentioned and don't align with the described aesthetic.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungasilo lelinye lemaphuzu layinhloko ekucudzelaneni kwema-B&B akanokusho?","The correct answer is **A: Kuhlobisa kwesimanjemanje (Modern decor)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the two main points of focus for luxurious B&Bs are:

*   **Accommodation (Kwekulala)** -  Described as finding comfortable beds, perhaps a quilted blanket or a beautiful antique bed.
*   **Breakfast (Kudla kwasekuseni)** - Described as seasonal or customized food.

The passage also mentions historical buildings and antique furniture, emphasizing a classic, not modern, aesthetic.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned in the passage:

*   **B: Tinhlobonhlobo tekudla kwasekuseni lokuniketwa ngetikhatsi letitsite (Variety of breakfast offered at specific times)** - The text talks about customized or seasonal breakfasts.
*   **C: Tintfo tekulala letisezingeni lelisetulu (High-quality accommodation)** - The passage directly describes luxurious beds and linens.
*   **D: Kudla netinatfo lokutfolakele endzaweni (Food and amenities sourced locally)** - While not directly stated, the emphasis on seasonal food suggests a local source.



Therefore, modern decor doesn't align with the described characteristics of a high-end B&B in this passage."
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungeke kubanjelwe eBeijing nga-2022?","The correct answer is **B: Imicimbi yekunjuza echweni yaseTaizicheng**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that some of the skiing events will be held in Taizicheng, Zhangjiakou, *not* in Beijing. The opening and closing ceremonies, and events within the stadium, will be held in Beijing.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuluku lokulandzelako lokutawubanjelwa eBeijing nga-2022?","The correct answer is **C: Ema-Olimpiki asebusika**.

The passage states: ""Lidolobha laseBeijing eShayina litobamba **Imidlalo yaseBusika** yema-Olimpiki nga-2022..."" (The city of Beijing, China will host the **Winter** Olympic Games in 2022...) 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ema-Olimpiki asehlobo** - The passage specifically mentions *Winter* Olympics. It also says Beijing will be the first city to host both, but the 2022 games are Winter.
*   **B: Imicimbi yelichwa ledlalelwa ngekhatsi endlini** - While the opening and closing ceremonies are in Beijing, the passage doesn't define all events as being held indoors.
*   **D: Imicimbi yekuvala** - The closing ceremony is *part* of the Winter Olympics, but it's not the entire event being held in Beijing."
Ngubani losengotini yekutfola i-avian influenza?,"The correct answer is **C: Bantfu labasebenta ngetinkhunkhu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kaningi kufakwe bantfu labasebenta ngetinkhunkhu, kodvwa futsi kunengoti kulabo lababuka tinyoni."" This translates to: ""Many cases have been reported in people working with poultry, but there is also a risk to those who observe birds.""

While those who observe birds *are* at risk, the text specifically highlights that *many* cases have been reported in poultry workers. Therefore, they are the group most frequently affected and thus, most at risk.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako lawuchaza kahle umkhuhlane wetinkhukhu?","The correct answer is **C: Bantfu lababuka tinyoni basengotini yekuwutfola** (People who observe birds are at risk of getting it).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...futsi kunengoti kulabo lababuka tinyoni."" (and there is a risk to those who observe birds). This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tisebenti tetinkhukhu kuphela letiwutfola** (Only chicken workers get it) - The passage says workers are *often* infected, but also mentions a risk to bird watchers.
* **B: Banyenti bantfu lokubikwe kutsi banawo kwendlula tinyoni** (More people have been reported to have it than birds) - The passage doesn't compare the number of cases in birds vs. people.
* **D: Bonkhe bantfu lokubikwe kutsi banawo bafile** (All people reported to have it have died) - The passage states *some* cases have led to death, not all.



"
I-White Sea–Baltic Canal ihlanganisa ini?,"The correct answer is **C: I-Arctic Ocean ne-Baltic Sea**.

The passage explicitly states: ""I-White Sea–Baltic Canal ihlanganisa i-Arctic Ocean kuBaltic Sea..."" (The White Sea–Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean to the Baltic Sea...).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Etitimeleni letihamba ebusuku, emaphasipoti atsatfwa ngumholeli ungatophazamiseka nasowulele."" which translates to ""On night trains, passports are checked by the conductor even if you are asleep.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tindiza (Airplanes):** The text mentions airplanes as a place where you are *usually* checked, but doesn't say passports are checked while you're asleep on them.
* **C: Imikhumbi (Ships):** The text mentions ships as a place where you are *usually* checked, but doesn't specify passport checks while sleeping.
* **D: Titimela leteca imincele (Local trains):** The text states ID is required for these, but doesn't mention passport checks or checks while sleeping.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kunini lapho khona i-ID ingase ihlolwe kuletinye tetitimela leteca imincele?","The correct answer is **D: Nasisahamba sitimela**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Etitimeleni letihamba ebusuku, emaphasipoti atsatfwa ngumholeli ungatophazamiseka nasowulele."" This translates to ""On night trains, passports are checked by the conductor even while you are asleep.""  This directly indicates IDs (passports in this case) are checked *while the train is moving*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngemuva kwekwehla esitimeleni (After getting off the train):** The passage mentions checks happen *on* the train, not after disembarking.
*   **B: Nawusalele (When you are asleep):** While the passage *mentions* checks happen even when asleep, it doesn't mean that's the *only* time. It's a specific example of when they happen.
*   **C: Ayihlolwa (It is not checked):** The passage clearly states IDs *are* checked on some trains.

Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokunematfuba labanyenti ekutsi kwenteke nawusahlala endzaweni leshisako yaseSingapore?,"The correct answer is **C: Kuhlushwa kukhatsala** (Being overheated/suffering from the heat).

**Here's why:**

The passage (P) specifically states that ""hot spots"" in Singapore require you to deal with both heat (all the time) and strong sun.  Therefore, overheating is the most likely risk associated with staying in these areas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kubanjwa inkunzi** (Being stung by a jellyfish) - The passage doesn't mention jellyfish or stings.
*   **B: Kungakhoni kufinyelela etitolo** (Being unable to reach shops) - The passage states you can buy anything once you arrive in Singapore, implying access to shops.
*   **D: Kulahleka** (Getting lost) - The passage mentions Singapore is easy to get around, making getting lost less likely.



"
Ngubani longase afuna kungadli emakhekhe aseJalimane?,"The correct answer is **A: Umuntfu loguliswa kakhulu ngemantongomane** (Someone who is very allergic to nuts).

Here's why:

* The text specifically states that many German baked goods *include* almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Someone with a severe nut allergy would need to avoid these.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umuntfu lonconota emadizethi lamnandzi** (Someone who dislikes sweet fats) - German cakes are described as being paired with coffee, and generally sweet. This person wouldn't necessarily avoid them *because* they are German.
* **C: Umuntfu lowenyanya ishokolethi** (Someone who dislikes chocolate) - The text doesn't mention chocolate.
* **D: Umuntfu lonconota lokunongotelako kunalokuneluswayi** (Someone who prefers savoury to sweet) - While some people prefer savoury, this wouldn't make someone specifically avoid *German* cakes.



"
Ngusiphi sitsako lesitsatfwa njengencenye yemakhekhe aseJalimane yangesikhatsi lesitsite?,"The correct answer is **A: Emahhabhula** (Apples).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Emakhekhe lafakwa titselo avamile lawemahhabhula wona entiwa umnyaka wonke..."" which translates to ""Cakes often contain common fruits like apples which are made throughout the year...""

While almonds, hazelnuts, and plums are mentioned as ingredients in German cakes, apples are specifically noted as being *commonly* used and made with year-round.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungeke kunconywe nawuhamba ngemali lencane?","The correct answer is **C: Cela imali kubantfu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that to travel on a budget, you should consider things like being a ""cheap traveler, going to less popular places, or exchanging work for room and board"". It then mentions that the advice ""suggests that travelers work for small amounts of money, go where it’s free, or trade with others to benefit"".  Asking people directly for money is *not* listed as an acceptable or suggested method.

Let's look at why the other options are plausible, but incorrect based on the text:

*   **A: Kutfola imisetjentana phakatsi neluhambo** (Finding small jobs along the way) - This aligns with the idea of exchanging work for benefits, which is encouraged in the passage.
*   **B: Kulungele kushintja lizinga lakho lekunetseteka** (Being willing to change your comfort level) - Traveling on a budget inherently means sacrificing some comfort, so this is acceptable.
*   **D: Nciphisa tindleko letinjengetekudla netendzawo yekuhlala** (Reducing costs like food and accommodation) - This is a core principle of budget travel, directly mentioned in the first sentence of the second paragraph.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngubani longaba nesikhatsi lesimatima nakahamba ngemali lencane kakhulu?","The correct answer is **B: Umuntfu lote sikhatsi lesicinile (A person with limited time)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that people with little money for travel have ""nesikhatsi kuze bangabi nato tindleko"" which translates to ""time until they have no expenses"". This implies they have a limited amount of time *before* they run out of money and need to return.  The passage is about making the most of limited funds, and someone with limited *time* is most likely to need to be strategic about keeping costs down.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umuntfu lowemukela insayeya (A person who accepts advice)** - While taking the advice is good, it doesn't directly relate to *why* someone might be on a tight budget and timeline.
* **C: Umuntfu lohlela kusebenta nakasavakasha (A person who plans to work while traveling)** - This is a different strategy for traveling on a budget, and isn't the focus of this paragraph.
* **D: Umuntfu lotsandza kulandzela luhla lwetintfo letentiwako (A person who likes to follow a list of things to do)** - This is unrelated to the time constraints mentioned in the passage.



"
Ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako langakuchazi kahle kushayela emkhatsini we-Point Marion ne-Fairmont?,"The correct answer is **C: Kuyetfukela kutsi litubane lelibekiwe ligcinwe**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Litubane lokufanele uhambe ngalo emgwacweni libonakala ngalokucacile — ngalokuvamile kuba ngu-35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — futsi kuhamba ngalelitubane kubaluleke kakhulu."" This directly translates to ""The speed limit on this road is clear—usually 35-40 mph—and staying within that limit is very important."" It highlights the *need* to pay attention to and abide by the speed limit because of the challenging driving conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kunetincenye letindze temigwaco yasemaphandleni:** The text mentions challenging rural roads, but doesn't specify *many* sections.
*   **B: Imizila mincane:** The text does mention small hills, but this isn't the primary challenge.
*   **D: Isevisi yamahlalekhikhini ayisiyo inkinga:** The text actually mentions good cell service, which contrasts with the idea that service is a problem.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokufanele kukhatsate kakhulu bashayeli labashayela emgwacweni i-Buffalo-Pittsburg?","The correct answer is **C: Kujika ngekushesha** (Sharp turns).

Here's why:

The passage specifically warns drivers to be cautious of ""ekwehleleni nasemenyukeleni"" (descents and ascents), ""imivila lemincane"" (tight curves), and ""makoneni lavelele"" (blind corners). It emphasizes slow speeds (35-40 mph) are necessary because of these features.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kubambeka esiminyaminyeni setimoti** (Getting stuck in mud) - The passage doesn't mention mud.
*   **B: Kushoda kwesevisi leyenele yamahlalekhikhini** (Lack of adequate bathroom facilities) - The passage doesn't discuss bathroom services.
*   **D: Kutfola kakhulu tincene lapho kulungiswa khona umgwaco** (Finding many cones where the road is being repaired) - The passage doesn't mention road repairs.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungadzingeki kuze ucale kugcuma emfuleni losendzaweni leneliwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Likhono lekubhukusha (The ability to swim)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""kuzuba etindzaweni letisemaweni kuhlanganisa tintfo letinjengekubhukusha, kukhwela intsaba kanye nekugcuma..."" which translates to ""exploring in aquatic environments includes things like swimming, climbing mountains, and diving..."". It then specifically contrasts this with activities like canyoning which require specific preparation (physical fitness, etc.).

The question asks what is *not* needed to start diving in a river. The passage implies you need the ability to swim (kubhukusha), physical fitness, and the ability to dive (kugcuma) and perhaps some minimal preparation (kuceceshwa lokuncane). However, simply being in good physical condition (B: Simo semtimba lesisetulu) isn't enough on its own – you still need the skill of swimming to even begin.  

Therefore, the ability to swim is a foundational skill for diving and less directly related to preparation compared to the other options.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungase kudzingeke nawusagcuma emfuleni losendzaweni leneliwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Sitifiketi sekugcuma emfuleni losendzaweni leneliwa (A certificate for river crossing in a wilderness area)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that wilderness activities like river crossing (kugcuma) require preparation and skill. While all the options *could* be helpful, a **certificate** specifically indicates training and competency for the dangerous activity of crossing a river in a wilderness setting.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Likhono lelisetulu lekudlala (General athletic ability):** While helpful, athletic ability isn't specific enough for the dangers of a wilderness river crossing.
*   **B: Sipiliyoni sekunjweza ekhatsi emantini (Experience swimming in the ocean):** Ocean swimming is different than navigating a potentially fast-flowing, rocky river.
*   **D: Likhono lekubhukusha (Swimming ability):**  Again, while important, simply being able to swim isn’t sufficient for a safe river crossing – you need specialized knowledge and skills.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengasita umuntfu lohlela kuyokhempa emotweni?","The correct answer is **B: Imoti levumela tihlalo kutsi tilale**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kukhempa ngemoto kungenteka nawunekhumbi lencane nobe i-SUV, Sedan nobe Station Wagon lenetitulo letikhonako kulala phansi."" This directly translates to ""Car camping is possible if you have a hatchback or an SUV, Sedan or Station Wagon with seats that can fold down.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kucondza kahle kutsi yini imoti yakhe lengakwati kuyenta** (Understanding what your car can do) - While generally good advice, the passage *specifically* mentions the ability to lay the seats down.
* **C: Lithende** (A parking spot) -  The passage mentions parking is easier, but it doesn't say a parking spot *helps* with car camping, only that it's a benefit of having a smaller car.
* **D: Indzawo yekukhempa lengasiyo yawonkhewonkhe** (A non-traditional camping spot) - The passage doesn't focus on *where* to camp, but *how* to camp in a car.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini bantfu labakhempa etimotweni labangase bafune kuyigwema nabafuna kunganakeki?","The correct answer is **C: Kugcumeka lithende edolobheni nome endzaweni lengasiyo yawonkhewonkhe.**

Here's why:

The passage states that parking in a tight spot or in town easily ""attracts people's eyes unnecessarily."" If someone wants to remain unnoticed while car camping, they would want to avoid doing that. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage suggests *any* vehicle with a reclining seat can be used for car camping, so avoiding larger vehicles isn't about avoiding attention.
*   **B:** Long road trips are presented as enjoyable, not something to avoid for discretion.
*   **D:** The passage doesn't mention needing to match the car to one's usual vehicle to remain unnoticed.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngubani lowakha i-Casablanca kabusha lihlandla lesibili?","The correct answer is **D: Inkhosi yaseMorocco**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lombusi waseMorocco walakha kabusha lelidolobhakati walicamba ngekutsi yiDaru l-Badya..."" This directly translates to ""The ruler of Morocco rebuilt the city and named it Daru l-Badya..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: NgemaPutukezi (The Portuguese)** - The text says the Portuguese *originally* built it, but not the second rebuild.
*   **B: Batsengisi BaseSpain (Spanish merchants)** - They *called* it Casablanca, but didn't rebuild it.
*   **C: Ngema-Merenids (The Merenids)** - They used Anfa (the original name) as a center, but didn't rebuild it after it was abandoned.



"
Bobani labashiya lidolobha lesimanje lase-Casablanca ngemuva kwesehlakalo semvelo?,"The correct answer is **B: NgemaPutukezi**.

The text states: ""EmaPutukezi ayibhidlita futsi ayakha kabusha ase ayetsa ngekutsi yiCasa Branca, kodvwa ase ayayiyekela ngemuva kwekutamatama kwemhlaba nga-1755."" (The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it and called it Casa Branca, but they abandoned it after the earthquake in 1755.)

Therefore, the Portuguese left the city after the natural disaster."
"Ngekwalesicephu, i-Sintra yakutfola kanjani kucashelwa phakatsi kwebantfu bekuhamba?","The correct answer is **C: Kubuketa lokuhle kwa-Lord Byron**.

Here's why:

The passage states Sintra became famous ""because of the famous poetic account of its splendor written by Lord Byron."" This directly links Sintra's popularity to Byron's writings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ECabo da Roca** - Cabo da Roca is a place the bus goes *to* near Sintra, not the reason people know about Sintra.
*   **B: Kubonakala kwaMariya** - The passage mentions Fatima (a Marian shrine) but doesn't say it caused Sintra to become famous.
*   **D: Umlandvo wayo wetekutsandzana** - While Sintra may have a history, the passage specifically attributes its fame to Byron's poem.



"
Yini lengacashelwa yi-Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: Umbuso webantfu lomusha** (A new government of the people).

Here's why:

The passage states that despite the Armenia-led victory and the establishment of a self-declared republic, *no government was actually established - not even recognized by Armenia itself*. This is the key point of what Armenia failed to do.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sifundza sase-Nagorno-Karabakh** (The region of Nagorno-Karabakh) - Armenia *did* support the region's independence movement, they didn't ignore the region itself.
*   **B: Imphi ngalokumelene na-Azeris** (The war against the Azeris) - Armenia *won* the war.
*   **C: Tincabano temancusa ase-Azerbaijan** (Azerbaijani military conflicts) - The passage states that disputes continued to damage relations, but doesn't say Armenia neglected conflicts.



"
Yini lechubeka iphazamisa buhlobo emkhatsini we-Azerbaijan ne-Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: Sifundza sase-Nagorno-Karabakh** (The region of Nagorno-Karabakh).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Timpikiswano tahulumende esifundzeni liyachubeka nokonakalisa buhlobo emkhatsini we-Armenia ne-Azerbaijan.""  This translates to: ""Disputes over the territory continue to damage relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan."" This directly points to the ongoing conflict *over the region of Nagorno-Karabakh* as the source of the strained relationship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bantfu base-Armenians labahlala e-Azerbaijan** (Armenians living in Azerbaijan) - While their situation *is* a factor, the core issue is the disputed territory itself.
*   **B: Imphi yanga-1994** (The 1994 war) - The war *created* the situation, but the ongoing *disputes over the territory* are what continue to harm relations.
*   **C: Tincabano temancumo** (Political disagreements) - This is too broad. The text pinpoints the disagreement to a specific territory.

"Nawusahamba ngetekisi e-Charlotte, yini lengaholela ekukhokhisweni lokwengetiwe?","The correct answer is **B: Kuba nebagibeli labatsatfu**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Ubhadala kakhulu nangabe unebantfu lohamba nabo labangetulu kwabangu-2, ngako lendlela lena ingabita kakhulu ngaphandle kwesidzingo."" This directly translates to ""You pay more if you have more than 2 people traveling with you, so this method can be expensive unnecessarily.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuhlala kulenye indzawo (Living in another place):** The passage doesn't mention cost being affected by where you live.
*   **C: Kuya encenyeni lesenhla yelidolobha (Going to the north end of the city):** The passage doesn't connect location within the city to taxi fares.
*   **D: Kuba yindzawo lekahle emindenini (Being a good place for families):** This is a general description of Charlotte and doesn't relate to taxi costs.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengatsatfwa njengentfo lembi ngekuhlala e-Charlotte nebantfwana?","The correct answer is **B: Kutsatsa itekisi** (Taking taxis).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ematekisi akakavami kusetjentiswa imindeni yaseCharlotte, noma nje bangawasebentisa kuletinye timo. Ubhadala kakhulu nangabe unebantfwana lohamba nabo labangetulu kwabangu-2, ngako lendlela lena ingabita kakhulu ngaphandle kwesidzingo."" (Taxis are not often used by Charlotte families, or even if they do use them sometimes. You pay a lot if you have more than 2 people traveling with you, so this method can be expensive unnecessarily.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Imali yetindlu (Housing costs):** The passage doesn't mention housing costs being a negative. It highlights the *quality* of housing as a positive.
*   **C: Bahlali bakuletinye tindzawo (Out-of-town residents):** The passage mentions them, but not as a negative aspect of living in Charlotte.
*   **D: Kwetama kujabulela lidolobha (Difficulty enjoying the city):** The passage says the city is *easy* to enjoy with children.



"
"Ngembi kwekufika kwebantfu base-Spain, bobani lebebaphetse incenye lesenyakatfo ye-Chile?","The correct answer is **D: Ema-Incas**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""before the arrival of the Spanish, the northern part of Chile was under Inca rule..."" 

While the Mapuche were also present and important, the text specifically says the *northern* part was under Inca control *before* the Spanish arrived. The Araucanians are another name for the Mapuche. ""Emamelika"" is too general."
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungazange kwenteke nga-1810?","The correct answer is **B: I-Chile yancoma Spain**.

Here's why:

The text states that Chile *declared* independence in 1810, but actual independence from Spain wasn't achieved until 1818. Declaring independence is not the same as succeeding from Spain, meaning they did not overcome Spain in 1810.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bekute hulumende lomkhulu** - The text says Napoleon's wars left Spain *without* a functioning government, so this *did* happen.
*   **C: Bekuliwa timphi ta-Napoleon** - The text explicitly mentions Napoleon's wars as a backdrop to the events in Chile.
*   **D: I-Chile yamemetela inkhululeko** - The text states Chile *declared* independence in 1810.



"
Bantfu bangafika kanjani etindzaweni letichelile esifundzeni sase-Liguria?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngesitimela nome ngesikebhe** (By train or by boat).

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Imigcwaco, titimela kanye nemikhumbi lehlanganisa tigodzi, timoto atikhoni kufinyelela kuleto tindzawo."" This translates to ""Roads, trains and boats connect the villages, cars cannot reach these places.""
*   Therefore, the only ways to access these villages are by train or boat.



"
Ligama lesiTaliyane lelitsi ‘Cinque Terre’ libhekisela kuphi?,"The correct answer is **A: Tindzawo letisihlanu**.

The text directly translates ""Cinque Terre"" as ""Tindzawo Letinhlanu"" which means ""Five Places"" or ""Five Lands"". Therefore, it refers to the five villages.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguluphi luhlobo lwesikebhe lolulungela timo letingase tibe nguletishelelako ebusika?","The correct answer is **D: Emabhudzi lete iphethini lejulile lengema-intji langu-1/5** (Boots with a deep tread pattern of 1/5 inch or more).

Here's why:

* **The text specifically states:** ""Lephethini kufanele ibe ngu-5mm (1/5 inch) noma ngetulu, futsi lendvwangu itsambe ngalokwenele etindzaweni letibandzako."" (The pattern should be 5mm (1/5 inch) or more, and the sole should grip enough in icy areas).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Emabhudzi lanetitsendze letincane** (Boots with small treads) - The text says winter roads are slippery and need *good* grip, which small treads wouldn't provide.
* **B: Emabhudzi lanemastadi** (Boots with studs) - While studs offer good grip, the text doesn't specifically mention them as a requirement.  It focuses on tread depth.
* **C: Emabhudzi lanetitsendze letiphakeme** (Boots with high treads) - While height *can* contribute, the *depth* of the tread (1/5 inch or more) is the key detail mentioned.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokungeke kusite ekuvikeleni kushelela emigwacweni lenelichwa ngesikhatsi sasebusika?,"The correct answer is **D: Emanti (Water)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that salt (calcium chloride) and grit are used to *make it easier to walk* on icy roads. It also mentions that ice is slippery. Therefore, water (which *creates* ice) would be the least helpful and most likely to *contribute* to the slipping hazard.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Luswayi (Salt):** The passage states salt (calcium chloride) is used to improve traction.
*   **B: Igraveli (Gravel):** The passage mentions needing boots with good soles for gravel roads, implying gravel is a normal winter road surface.
*   **C: Sihlabatsi (Grit):** The passage explicitly states grit is used to improve traction on icy roads.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokuchaza kahle kufana lokukhona emkhatsini we-Hawaii ne-Cook Islands?,"The correct answer is **C: Letindzawo tinesikhatsi lesifanako**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Njengoba tihambisana ngetikhatsi neHawaii, tichingi ngaletinye tikhatsi kucatjangwa kutsi """"tase-Hawaii""""."" This directly translates to ""As they are similar to Hawaii, these islands are sometimes referred to as """"mini-Hawaiis"""". 

This indicates a similarity in *feel* or *atmosphere*, not necessarily in features like hotels (A) or being uninhabited (B). While the passage does mention the Cook Islands have cities (D), the comparison to Hawaii isn't based on that fact. The comparison is about a shared feeling or resemblance.



"
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungayichazi kahle i-Cook Islands?,"The correct answer is **C: Emadolobha lamakhulu yi-Rarotonga ne-Aituta**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lesichingi saseCook site emadolobha kodvwa sinetichingi letingu 15 letehlukene. Lesiyinhloko yiRarotonga kanye ne-Aitutaki."" This translates to ""The Cook Islands are not cities but have 15 separate islands. The main ones are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.""  The passage *doesn't* say these are large cities, just the main islands.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yincane kune-Hawaii (It's smaller than Hawaii):** The passage compares it to Hawaii and mentions it's smaller, making this a correct description.
* **B: Licoco letichingi (It consists of islands):** The passage clearly states it's an archipelago (a chain of islands) with 15 islands.
* **D: Lelive lelisichingi linesikhatsi lesifanako nese-Hawaii (The island has the same climate as Hawaii):** The passage mentions the similarity in climate, making this a correct description.



"
Nguyiphi kuletindzawo letilandzelako talabagadza tilwane lenetinhlobo letimbili tetindzawo tekulala longakhetsa kuto?,"The correct answer is **A: I-Sirena**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sirena ngiyo kuphela indzawo lapho ungakhona kulala khona futsi udle nekudla lokushisako ngetulu nje kwekukhempa."" This translates to ""Sirena is the only place where you can sleep and eat hot food in addition to camping.""  This means it offers two types of lodging - sleeping in a building and camping.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **I-Los Patos:** Not mentioned in the text.
*   **I-La Leona:** Only offers camping (""utfola kuphela indzawo yekukhempa"").
*   **I-San Pedrillo:** Only offers camping (""utfola kuphela indzawo yekukhempa"")."
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi lapho ungafuna khona imvume yepaki nawufuna kusebentisa kheshi kunesikweleti?","The correct answer is **B: E-Puerto Jiménez**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kungenteka kutsi utfole imvume yekungena epaki ngalokucondzile eRanger Station ePuerto Jiménez, kodvwa abawemukeli emakhadi ekubhadala ngesikweleti."" This directly translates to ""You can obtain a permit to enter the park in advance at the Ranger Station in Puerto Jiménez, but they do not accept credit cards."" 

The question asks where you can get a permit and still *use* a credit card. The passage doesn't mention being able to use a credit card at Sirena, La Leona, or CafeNet El Sol for the permit itself. CafeNet El Sol offers *financial assistance*, not a permit."
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguluphi luhlobo lwekuntjuza echweni lolwentiwa endzaweni leyehlelako?","The correct answer is **A: Kuhamba nge-ski (Skiing)**.

Here's why:

The passage directly compares walking in a gorge to climbing a mountain and mentions ""walking in the gorge"" can be like ""sliding through the gorge"" at times. The passage also describes needing sturdy shoes and boots, which are commonly used for skiing. Therefore, it's safe to assume that the kind of gorge exploration described is skiing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kuntjuza echweni etindzaweni tasemakhaya (Gorge exploration in local areas)** - This is too vague. The passage describes a specific *type* of gorge exploration.
*   **C: Kuhamba nato tonkhe tintfo lotidzingako (Traveling with everything you need)** - This is a general statement about hiking/exploring, not a specific type of gorge exploration.
*   **D: Kuntjuza ube umeme tikhwama (Exploring with empty pockets)** - This is irrelevant to the description of the activity.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengasita bantfu labantjuza etindzaweni letisemaphandleni labafuna kufinyelela litubane lelisetulu?","The correct answer is **A: Emabhudzi lacinile (Strong boots)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that higher-level canyoning (like in steeper canyons) ""is done in places that require solid boots and helmets."" The passage compares canyoning to mountain climbing, emphasizing the need for appropriate footwear.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bhaki losindzako (A strong backpack):** While a backpack might be useful, it's not directly mentioned as essential for reaching a high point in the canyon.
*   **C: Timo letikahle (Good shoes):** The text specifically mentions *solid* boots, implying a need for more substantial footwear than just ""good shoes"".
*   **D: Tindlela letilungisiwe (Well-maintained paths):** The description of canyoning suggests navigating through a natural canyon, which wouldn't necessarily have well-maintained paths.



"
Bantfu labebahambile labanenkinga yekwetfuka nababuyela ekhaya yini labakutfola kumatima kuyenta?,"The correct answer is **A: Kwetayela lisiko lendzawo lensha**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that returning home after being away is difficult because you need to readjust to a *new* (or re-established) culture and it can be painful. It highlights the challenge of tourists adjusting to this new/old culture, and losing habits from the culture they've become accustomed to.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kuba nesineke nekucondza (Being patient and understanding):** While patience is helpful, the passage doesn't say this is *difficult* for returning people, but rather that *others* should be patient with them.
* **C: Kuvakashela kulamanye emave (Visiting other countries):** This is unrelated to the difficulty of *returning home*.
* **D: Kwetayelana nelisiko lendzawo yakubo (Adjusting to their original culture):** The passage implies it's *not* easy to adjust back to your original culture after being away – it's a ""new"" experience because *you* have changed.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kwetfuka nawubuyela ekhaya kungabe matima ngalokukhetsekile kuluphi luhlobo lwemuntfu lobekahambile?","The correct answer is **A: Bantfu labahambako labahlangabetane nekwetfuswa lisiko** (People who have travelled and experienced a different culture).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""usuke sojwayele emasiko nemihambo lehlukile futsi walahlekelwa nguleminye imikhuba yemasiko aseveni lakini."" (You have become accustomed to different customs and habits and lost some of your own cultural practices.) This means the difficulty of readjustment is highest for those who have *immersed themselves* in another culture.
* The passage emphasizes the shock of returning to a familiar yet now *different* home environment after being accustomed to a new one.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bantfu labahambako labasheshe betayele nabakulamanye emave** (People who travel quickly and have a lot of luggage) -  This focuses on the *how* of travel, not the *impact* of cultural immersion.
* **C: Bantfu labahambako labaseseholidini letitsandzani** (People who go on short vacations) - Short vacations don't typically allow for deep cultural immersion; the readjustment wouldn't be as significant.
* **D: Bantfu labahambako labete sineke** (People who travel with patience) - Patience is a good trait for any traveler, but it doesn't directly address the core issue of cultural readjustment.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokufanele bantfu bangakwenti esilwaneni lokutsiwa yimusi?,"The correct answer is **A: Kunganaki kutsi ikhona** (To ignore that it is there).

Here's why:

The passage states the moose *will defend itself if it feels threatened*.  Therefore, the safest thing to do is to avoid provoking it by not acknowledging its presence and giving it space.

Let's look at why the other options are wrong:

* **B: Kuya ngelitubane leliphansi kakhulu** (Going to the lowest possible point) - This doesn't address the moose's defensive behavior.
* **C: Kutsatsa kancane ingoti yaso** (Touching its antlers slightly) - This is *extremely* dangerous and would almost certainly provoke an attack.
* **D: Kuyibukela khashane** (Staring at it intently) - Direct eye contact can be perceived as a threat by many animals, including moose.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako langasilo liciniso mayelana nesilwane lokutsiwa yimusi?","The correct answer is **A: Ngekwemvelo tilwane letinelulaka** (Naturally a ferocious animal).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""IMoose (leyatiwa ngele elk) ngekutalwa alinalo lulaka..."" (The moose (also known as elk) is naturally ferocious...).
* **Option B:** The passage says people *can* get too close and be in danger, implying it *can* be dangerous, not that it’s always considered a dangerous animal.
* **Option C:** The passage says it defends itself when attacked, not that it's easily angered by people approaching.
* **Option D:** The passage explicitly states it *does* defend itself when threatened, making this statement true, not false.

Therefore, the only statement that contradicts the information in the passage is that a moose is naturally ferocious, which the passage confirms is true.  The question asks for the statement that is **not** true."
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungeke kube yingoti kakhulu kumuntfu lohamba elugwadvule?","The correct answer is **A: Kushoda kwetimphahla letifutfumele ngebusuku lobubandzako (Lack of warm clothing on a cold night)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ngisho nelugwadvule lolushisako lungabandza kakhulu ebusuku."" (Even a hot desert gets very cold at night.)  It then links this to needing warm things (""Emakhata angaba ingoti mbamba nawute timphahla letishisako"" - blankets can be a lifesaver if you have warm clothes).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kubona lutalagu lolwenta kube ngatsiumuntfu ubona emanti (Seeing a mirage that makes it seem like you see water)** - The passage warns *against* chasing mirages as they can lead to exhaustion and death.
* **C: Kumosha emandla usagijimisa lutalagu (Wasting energy chasing a mirage)** -  Similar to B, the passage warns against this.
* **D: Kumosha emanti usagijimisa lutalagu (Wasting water chasing a mirage)** - The passage warns against running out of water.

Therefore, lacking warm clothes on a cold night is the most direct and significant danger described in the passage for someone traveling in the desert.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungashiwongo njengengoti bantfu labahamba elugwadvule labangase babhekane nayo?,"The correct answer is **C: I-Hypothermia**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where people can be overcome by cold, almost as if they are water (weak and collapsing).** This is a clear description of hypothermia - a dangerous drop in body temperature. It mentions the cold being especially strong at night and how even hot clothes can become ineffective.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kushoda kwemati (Dehydration):** While the passage mentions a traveler wanting water and possibly using it up, the core danger described isn't a lack of water, but the *cold*.
* **B: Lutalagu (Sunstroke/Heat exhaustion):**  The passage talks about the cold, not the heat. It actually mentions hot clothes, implying a need for warmth, not cooling down.
* **D: Kushiswa lilanga (Sunburn):** Similar to B, the passage focuses on cold temperatures.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguliphi licembu lebantfu lelatsintseka kakhulu ngemuva kwekufika kwebahloli bemave?","The correct answer is **C: Ema-Taíno**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""linani lebantfu baseTainos lancishiswa bancobi baseSpain"" (the number of Taíno people was reduced by Spanish colonizers) and goes on to state an estimated 100,000 Taínos were killed.  This directly indicates they were the group most affected by the arrival of the explorers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bantfu baseHaiti** - The text mentions Haiti as sharing the island but doesn't say their population declined due to the explorers in this passage.
*   **B: Bantfu baseCaribean** - This is too broad. While the Taíno were Caribbean people, the text focuses specifically on the impact to the Taíno.
*   **D: Bantfu Base-Spain** - The text states the Spanish *caused* the decline, not that they themselves were negatively impacted.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguluphi lulwimi lobelukhulunywa bantfu baseCaribean?","The correct answer is **D: Si-Arawakan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""EmaCaribes bekabantfu lebebakhuluma si-Arawaka labafika cishe nga-10,000 BCE."" This directly translates to ""The Caribs were people who spoke Arawakan who arrived around 10,000 BCE.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: SiHaiti** - While Haiti shares the island of Hispaniola, the passage specifically mentions Arawakan as the language of the *original* Caribbean people.
*   **B: Sipanish** - Spanish came with the Spanish colonizers *after* the original inhabitants.
*   **C: SiNgisi** - English is not mentioned in the context of the original inhabitants.



"
Ngubani lokufanele abongwe ngekwenta umdlalo wekuntjuza echweni watiwe njengemdlalo wekutijabulisa?,"The correct answer is **B: Bantfu BaseNorway**.

Here's why:

The text states that the first ski club was founded by Norwegians in Australia in 1861. This indicates they were instrumental in formalizing and popularizing skiing as a recreational activity. While ""ski bums"" enjoy skiing, they didn't *invent* it as a pastime. The mention of ancient art doesn't credit a specific group with the *recreational* aspect, and Australians are mentioned as the location of the first club, not the founders.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kungasiphi sikhatsi lapho kuntjuza echweni kwacashelwa kwekucala njengemdlalo?","The correct answer is **D: Ngelikhulu lesi-17**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kushibilika elichweni kusukela emuva cishe ngelikhulu lesi-17..."" which translates to ""Skiing has been practiced since around the 17th century..."". 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngelikhulu lesi-18:** While clubs formed later, the *practice* started earlier.
*   **B: Nga-5000 BC:** The text mentions artwork depicting early forms of gliding, but not organized skiing as a sport.
*   **C: 1861:** This is when the first skiing *club* was founded, not when the activity itself began.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokuhlotjaniswa ngesichingi lesikhulu kunato tonkhe elugwini lwe-Afrika lesemphumalanga?,"The correct answer is **A: Litfonya leYurophu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Litfonya leYurophu kanye nekwenta lamanye emave emakoloni kwacala ngelikhulu lesi 15 ngesikhatsi inhloli yasePortugal Vasco da Gama atfola indlela lehamba ekapa leya eNdiya."" This directly links European influence as a major historical factor impacting the region, starting with the Portuguese exploration.

Let's look at why the other options are less central to the *entire* eastern African coast as described in the passage:

*   **B: Inkholo yeMasulumane (Islam):** While important (mentioned as brought by Arabs), it's presented as an earlier influence *before* European colonization, not the defining large-scale historical force.
*   **C: Tilwane tesiganga (Wildlife):** Madagascar is mentioned for its unique wildlife, but this isn't a defining characteristic of the *whole* eastern African coast.
*   **D: Tindzawo tekungcebeleka takanokusho (Beautiful beaches & resorts):** This is a modern characteristic, not a major historical factor shaping the region as a whole.



"
Yini lengasiyo imfanelo yetichingi letincane taseMphumalanga Ye-Afrika? ,"The correct answer is **A: Kuchumana neFrance**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""tinebudlelwane neFrance, tatiwa ngemabhishi lamahle lanetindzawo tekungcebeleka."" This translates to ""have a relationship with France, known for beautiful beaches and recreational areas.""  The question asks for something that is *not* a characteristic of the small islands. Having a relationship with France *is* a characteristic, making it the incorrect answer.

Let's look at why the other options are correct characteristics:

*   **B: Tindzawo letinyenti tekungcebeleka** - The passage mentions beautiful beaches and recreational areas.
*   **C: Kwatiwa ngetilwane tesiganga** - The passage states ""Letiningi tichingi letincane ngemave latimele, noma tinebudlelwane neFrance, tatiwa ngemabhishi lamahle lanetindzawo tekungcebeleka."" meaning ""Many small islands are surrounded by coral reefs, or have a relationship with France, known for beautiful beaches and recreational areas.""
*   **D: Kukhululeka kuletinye tive** - The passage mentions the influence of Arabs bringing Islam, implying interactions with cultures from elsewhere.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, Liphasika ligunjwa njani, ikakhulukati emasontfo emdzabu?","The correct answer is **B: Kubamba umlindzelo ngeMgcibelo**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Lamaningi emasontfo kaningi abamba **imilindzelo** ngema-Easter ngeMgcibelo ebusuku..."" (Many churches often hold **vigils** for Easter on Holy Saturday night...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuba nemsimeto wentalo** (Having a natural foundation) - While the passage mentions pre-Christian origins, it doesn't say this *is how* Easter is observed.
*   **C: Kuba nemcimbi wasentfwasahlobo welibandla** (Being a spring festival of the church) - The passage doesn't focus on Easter as a spring festival.
*   **D: Kubukela kuphuma kwelilanga** (Watching the sunrise) - The passage mentions watching the sunrise as *part* of the tradition, but it's not the defining characteristic. The vigil itself is.



"
"Kuze ugweme letinye tintfo letifunekako nawungena e-Ecuador, sakhamuti saseCuba kufanele sicale sibe nani?","The correct answer is **A: Ipasipoti lesalelwe sikhatsi lesingetulu kwetinyanga letingu-6 kusuka etinsukwini tekuhamba** (A passport valid for more than 6 months from the date of travel).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Iphasipoti yakho kufanele ibe semtsetfweni lokungenani tinyanga letingu-6 ngaphambi kwekutsi kufike lilanga lakho lekuhamba."" (Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months before your travel date.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Incwadzi yesimemo lecinisekisiwe** (Confirmed invitation letter) - While the text mentions an invitation letter, it's specifically for Cubans entering *without* using American cards.
*   **C: Lithikitsi lekuya nekubuya lelicinisekisa budze besikhatsi loyosihlala** (Round-trip ticket confirming length of stay) - The text states a return ticket is *required* as proof of stay, but it isn't a way to *avoid* other requirements.
*   **D: Matisi waseMelika** (American card) - Cubans using these cards need to visit the consulate to be *exempted* from the invitation letter requirement, not obtain it.



"
Yini timfuneko tekuvakasha e-Ecuador letingentelwanga yona?,"The correct answer is **B: Kugcina kungena nekuphuma kwebantfu kuhlelekile** (Maintaining orderly entry and exit of people).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the requirement for the invitation letter and other documentation is ""to ensure orderliness between the two countries"" regarding those traveling.  The other options are also requirements mentioned, but *orderliness of entry/exit* is the overall *reason* for the requirements.

*   **A** is incorrect - the passage doesn't mention limiting the number of tourists.
*   **C** is a requirement (proof of return ticket), but not the overarching purpose of the rules.
*   **D** is a requirement (6-month passport validity), but again, not the main goal of the requirements.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungase kubite kakhulu kulelinye live kwendlula eveni lakho?,"The correct answer is **B: Emafulemu lasezingeni lelisetulu (High-end frames)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that high-end frames from these places (where eye tests are done) have issues: some may be flimsy, and others might be more expensive than those bought locally.  The passage is concerned about the cost of these frames being higher.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuhlolwa kwemehlo (Eye tests)** - The passage *suggests* getting eye tests at home, especially if insurance covers them, potentially *saving* money.
*   **C: Umshuwalensi wemehlo (Eye insurance)** -  Insurance is presented as a way to *reduce* cost, not increase it.
*   **D: Emafulemi lete ligama (Designer frames)** - While these frames might be expensive, the passage's primary concern is with the general high cost of frames from those types of establishments, not specifically designer ones.



"
Nguyiphi ingoti lengase ibe khona ngekutsenga emafulemu lasezingeni lelisetulu kulelinye live?,"The correct answer is **C: Angase abe ngemafulemu mbumbulu**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that high-end frames from certain locations may be ""fake frames"" (""lamanye mhlawumbe angemafreyimi mbumbulu"") or cheaply made (""futsi lalangiwo mbamba langenisiwe mhlawumbe angadula kunewasekhaya""). This directly addresses the potential pitfall of buying expensive frames elsewhere – they might be counterfeit.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Kungase kudzingeke imali leyengetiwe yekuhlolwa kwemehlo** - While getting an eye exam could be a cost, the passage doesn't focus on the *exam* itself, but the *frames*.
*   **B: Tibuko tingase tingasebenti kulamanye emafulemu** - This isn't mentioned in the passage. The issue is the quality of the frames, not compatibility.
*   **D: Umshuwalensi kungenteka ungawakhokheli** - The passage mentions insurance *covering* the exam, not necessarily not covering it. The primary concern is the frame quality.

"Mayelana nekucetjentiswa kwemali e-Falklands, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako laliciniso?","The correct answer is **D: Ngaphandle kwampondo wase-Falkland, mpondo waseNgilandi ngalokuvamile ngiyo imali leyemukelwako**.

Here's why:

*   **The text states:** ""Pondo waseBritish litokwamukeleka nome ngukuphi etichingini..."" (British pounds are accepted anywhere in the shops...). This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text states dollars are also accepted, and card payments are common in Stanley.
*   **B:** While the main exchange point is in Stanley, the text also says US dollars are accepted.
*   **C:** The text explicitly advises *against* waiting to exchange Falklands pounds until after leaving the islands (""Kuyintfo lematima kushintja imali yakumaFalkands nasewuphumile kuletichingi, ngako shintja lemali kucala ngaphambi kwekutsi uhambe kuletichingi"")."
"Ngalokusekelwe kulesicephu, ngawuvakashela i-Falklands usuka eMelika, kukuphi lapho lenye indlela yekubhadala ngaphandle kwelikhadi lesikweleti ingaba lusito khona ngalokukhetsekile?","The correct answer is **A: Esitolo i-FIC West**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Indzawo lakungashitjwa khona imali kuletihlenge kusebhange liseStanley, lapha nje nawusuka eFIC West Store uwelela kulo.""  This directly translates to: ""The place where you can change money for purchases is at the bank in Stanley, right next to the FIC West Store."" This implies that FIC West is a location where currency exchange is convenient, and therefore, a good place to have an alternative to credit cards (like US dollars) readily available.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kuto tonkhe letichingi:** The text says credit cards are *not* always accepted in smaller shops.
* **C: Etichingini letingaphandle:** The text doesn’t mention anything specific about ""outside shops"".
* **D: Kuso sonkhe Stanley:** While Stanley is where the bank is for currency exchange, the text specifically links the convenience to FIC West.

Ngumuphi umcimbi longahlotjaniswa nekugunjwa kwemikhosi yelithempeli?,"The correct answer is **D: Imicimbi lemikhulu letsintsa lithemppeli (Major festivals celebrated at the temple)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Leminingi imikhosi yemathempeli abungatwa uma ahlanganisa umnyaka noma lophetse ahlanganisa umnyaka noma leminye imikhosi lemayelana nelithempeli."" This directly translates to ""Many temple festivals are celebrated when combining a year or the person combining a year or other festivals related to the temple.""  This indicates the events are *festivals*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kutalwa kwendlovu (Elephant birth):** The passage mentions decorated elephants *at* the festivals, but doesn't say elephant births *cause* the festivals.
* **B: Lusuku lwekukhumbula lilanga lithempeli lelaba khona ngalo (Commemoration day of the temple's founding):** While possible, the passage doesn't specifically mention a founding day commemoration. It's too narrow a focus.
* **C: Lusuku lwekutalwa lwankulunkulu (God's birthday):**  The passage doesn't explicitly state festivals are related to a god's birthday.



"
Kukuphi lapho kungabonakala khona tindlovu letihlotjisiwe?,"The correct answer is **B: Emathempelini** (At the temples).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Imigidvo yasethempelini iKerala iyatsandzeka kuyibona, nekungena njalo kwetindlovu letihlotjisiwe..."" (The temple festivals of Kerala are wonderful to see, with the constant entry of decorated elephants...). This directly links the decorated elephants to the temples.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nome ngukuphi kusukela ekupheleni kwaNovember kuya emkhatsini waMay** (Anywhere from the end of November to mid-May) - This is a timeframe mentioned in the passage, not a *location*.
*   **C: Eludvwendvweni lwasemikhosini yasethempelini** (In the midst of temple festivals) - While true they are *during* festivals, it doesn't specify where they are seen.
*   **D: Etitaladini taseKerala** (In the state of Kerala) - Too broad. While the festivals are *in* Kerala, the passage specifically says they are at the *temples*.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungenteka kuyindlela lencono yekonga imali encenyeni yebhizinisi nome yelizinga lekucala endizeni?","The correct answer is **A: Kubhadala ngenkapani yakho** (Paying with your company).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Indlela levamile yekugibela indiza uhlale endzaweni yesigaba sekucala noma esigabeni sabosomabhizinisi kutsi ubhadale imali lenkhulu kuze utfole lelo lungelo (noma **inkapane yakho ikubhadalele**)."" This translates to ""The typical way to fly in first or business class is to pay a lot of money for that privilege (or **your company pays for it**).""

The passage also highlights that paying with your company is a common way to access these higher classes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kubhuka incenye yelizinga lekucala kunencenye yebhizinisi** (Booking part first class and part business class) - The passage doesn't mention this as a strategy.
*   **C: Kubhuka indiza yelizinga lekucala lengayi ngalokucondzile endzaweni loya kuyo** (Booking a first-class flight that goes directly to your destination) - The passage implies direct flights in these classes are *more* expensive, not a way to save money.
*   **D: Kutfola sephulelo** (Getting a discount) - The passage states there's no need to *look for* a business or first-class discount on a direct flight.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kufuna ini lokungaba kucitsa sikhatsi nawubhuka letinye tigaba tekugibela endizeni?","The correct answer is **D: Incenye yelizinga lekucala** (First-class section).

Here's why:

The passage explains that while typically you pay a premium for first or business class, you can sometimes pay *many* times the normal economy fare for it.  It highlights that people are willing to pay a lot for the comfort and speed of these classes. The passage implies that *booking* these premium sections is what drives up the cost.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tindiza letiya ngalokucondzile endzaweni letsite** (Flights that depart from a nearby location) - The passage doesn't discuss location.
*   **B: Incenye yebhizinisi** (Business section) - While business class is expensive, the passage specifically contrasts it with *first class* being even more expensive.
*   **C: Tephulelo** (Discount) -  The passage talks about paying *more*, not less.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states to *not* forget to include extra costs like visas, accommodation, transportation, etc., when comparing costs to places *outside* of Africa.  The question asks what is *not* needed to consider when comparing African flight costs to global costs. Therefore, visas for non-African destinations are the factor to specifically remember to add in when comparing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tindleko temtselo wekuhamba e-Afrikha:** Accommodation *is* a cost that needs to be considered.
*   **C: Tindleko te-visa yase-Afrikha:** Visas *for* Africa are relevant to the comparison.
*   **D: Tindleko tekwekuhamba emgwacweni etindzaweni letingephandle kwe-Afrikha:** Transportation costs are relevant to the comparison.

"Ngekwalesicephu, yini titolo letinkhulu leseticala kuniketa kukhetsa lokuhlukahlukene kuyo?","The correct answer is **A: Kudla lesekuvele kuvutsiwe** (Pre-prepared food).

Here's why:

The passage states that when eating at a convenience store, unlike cooking at home, you have limited choices for cooked food *except* for pre-prepared meals. The passage then goes on to discuss the increasing number of stores offering various types of this pre-prepared food. This indicates that pre-prepared food is the main offering that provides variety within the limited scope of convenience store dining.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bohhavini be-microwave:** While some stores have microwaves, they aren't the main thing offering variety – you still need to *buy* something to heat up.
* **C: Titolo tekudlela:** The passage mentions some stores have dining areas, but describes them as often poorly maintained and not necessarily providing a good experience. They aren't the focus of providing diverse options.
* **D: Emanani lafinyelelekako:** The passage doesn't discuss affordability, only the limited selection.



"
Nguluphi lusito loluniketwa titolo letinkhulu lolungase lukhange likhasimende lelitsenga kudla lesekuvele kuvutsiwe?,"The correct answer is **B: Kukhetsa lokuncane lokuhlukehlukene**. 

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngaphandle kwematfuba ekupheka, kuncane longakukhetsa kwekutfola kudla lokuphekiwe."" This directly translates to ""Apart from cooking opportunities, there is little to choose from when getting pre-cooked food."" This highlights the *limited variety* available at these stores.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Titolo tekudlela (Restaurant stores):** The passage discusses stores *like* restaurants, but isn't specifically about restaurants themselves. It's about stores selling prepared food.
*   **C: Kudla lokungakavutfwa (Unheated food):** The passage talks about food that *is* pre-cooked and often needs heating.
*   **D: Hhavini we-microwave (Microwave oven):** While microwaves are mentioned as a way to heat the food, they are not the main issue or benefit the passage discusses.

Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungenteka kungacondvwa bantfu baseBelgium naseSwitzerland labakhuluma siFulentji?,"The correct answer is **A: Luhlelo lwetinombolo lolwetayelekile lwesiFulentji (The standard numbering system of French)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ikakhulukati luhlelo lwetinombolo ngesiFrench lesikhulunywa eBelgium naseSwitzerand sinetici letehlukile kusiFrench lesikhulunywa eFrance."" (Specifically, the French numbering system spoken in Belgium and Switzerland has a different accent than French spoken in France.) 

The passage also mentions they *learn* standard French in school, but still use the different numbering system in everyday speech. This makes it the most likely thing someone in Belgium or Switzerland speaking French would encounter.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Emagama esiFulentji langakavami (Uncommon French words):** The passage doesn't mention any difficulties with uncommon words.
*   **C: Indlela letsite yekubita emagama esiFulentji (A slightly different way of pronouncing French words):** While mentioned, the passage focuses more on the numbering system as the key difference.
*   **D: SiFulentji lesinyenti lesikhulunywa eFrance (The vast majority of French spoken in France):** The passage focuses on the *differences* between the French spoken in these regions, not the similarities to standard French in France.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako eFrance lokungafani naseBelgium nome eSwitzerland?,"The correct answer is **B: Luhlelo lwetinombolo**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ikakhulukati luhlelo lwetinombolo ngesiFrench lesikhulunywa eBelgium naseSwitzerand sinetici letehlukile kusiFrench lesikhulunywa eFrance..."" (Specifically, the number system in French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland has a different accent than French spoken in France).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Indlela yekubita onkhe emagama (The way all words are pronounced):** The passage states the pronunciation of *some* words is slightly different, not all.
*   **C: SiFulentji letivamile lesifundziswa etikolweni (Standard French taught in schools):** The passage says everyone in Belgium and Switzerland *learns* standard French, meaning it's the same as in France.
*   **D: Indlela lamanye emagama esiFulentji labhalwa ngayo (The way French words are written):** The passage doesn't mention any differences in spelling.

Kukusiphi simo lapho ungase unganikwa khona imali yekushonelwa?,"The correct answer is **B: Nawetama kubhuka ngalokucondzile enkapanini yetindiza kunakulabaniketa lusito labatimele**. 

Here's why:

The passage states that you need to **book directly through the airline's phone line** to be eligible for bereavement fares. Option B reflects this requirement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While WestJet *offers* bereavement fares, simply flying with them doesn't guarantee you'll receive one.
*   **C:** The passage doesn't specify a route (Paris to America) - it simply states Lufthansa offers bereavement fares.
*   **D:** Delta *offers* bereavement fares, but like WestJet, just flying with them isn’t enough. You need to book correctly.



"
Ngukuphi lokuliciniso mayelana nemali yekushonelwa?,"The correct answer is **D: Kufanele ubhuke ngalokucondzile nenkapani yetindiza usebentisa lucingo** (You must book in advance with the airline using the phone).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Kuto tonkhe tikhatsi, kufanele ubhuke ngamakhalekhukhwini wakho ngalokucondzile esiteshini setindiza."" which translates to ""In all cases, you must book in advance over the phone at the airline station.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ikhokhola tindleko temngcwabo** (It pays funeral costs) - The text says it *reduces* costs for immediate burial, not that it covers them entirely.
*   **B: Kufanele ubhuke ngalokucondzile ekhasini le-inthanethi lenkapani yetindiza** (You should book in advance on the airline's website) - The text specifically mentions booking *by phone*.
*   **C: Ikhokhola tindleko teluhambo loluphutfumako** (It pays for interrupted travel costs) - This isn't mentioned in the text.

Kunini lapho kusebentisa i-GPS levamile kungaba lusito kakhulu khona kunekusebentisa i-app ye-GPS?,"The correct answer is **C: Nangabe uphuma ku-inthanethi** (If you are offline).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Nangabe lucingo lwakho lungakhonekithi ku-inthanethi, noma lungabambi kahle, ngete lwasebenta kahle nobe lungatfolakali."" (If your phone is not connected to the internet, or has a poor connection, a regular GPS might work well or be unavailable). This directly contrasts with app-based GPS which *requires* an internet connection or pre-downloaded maps.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nawetama konga imali** (If you want to save money) - While GPS devices can be expensive, the passage mentions apps can also save money by replacing maps.
* **B: Nawuciniseka kutsi utawuba nemadatha** (If you are sure you'll have data) - The passage focuses on the *lack* of data, making this the opposite of when a regular GPS is better.
* **D: Nawungafuni kurentha idivayisi** (If you don't want to rent a device) - This is a benefit of apps, not a situation where a regular GPS is superior.



"
Yini lengasiso sizatfu lesihle sekusebentisa i-app ye-GPS nakucatsaniswa nemshini we-GPS lotimele?,"The best answer is **A: Kungabi nesidzingo sekukhatsateka ngema-datha** (You won't need to worry about data).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Nangabe lucingo lwakho lungakhonekithi ku-inthanethi, noma lungabambi kahle, ngete lwasebenta kahle nobe lungatfolakali."" (If your phone isn't connected to the internet, or doesn't get a good signal, it might not work well or be found at all).  This highlights the advantage of an app *not* relying on data connectivity.

Let's look at why the other options are less strong:

* **B: Konga imali** (Save money) - While the passage mentions saving money compared to buying GPS devices or maps, this isn't the *primary* benefit. A dedicated GPS also costs money.
* **C: Kubalekela kurenta** (Avoid renting) -  Again, it's a cost benefit, but not the central advantage.
* **D: Kungabi nesidzingo sekutsenga emabalave lamasha** (You won't need to buy new maps) - This is a benefit, but less important than the ability to function *without* internet access.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ungacinisekisa kanjani kutsi ucondzaniswa nemkhumbi lofanelekako?","The best answer is **C: Kubhuka nenkapani lesebenta ngekuvakasha eGalapagos** (Booking with a company that specializes in Galapagos tours).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of a company with ""in-depth knowledge of routes and ship types.""** This is exactly what a specialist Galapagos tour operator would have. They understand the different ships, itineraries, and what each offers.
* **Options A, B, and D are all factors, but not the *primary* way to ensure a good fit.**
    * **A:** Traveling with a group of like-minded people is good, but doesn't guarantee the *ship* is right for you.
    * **B:** Booking early helps get a spot, but doesn't help choose the right ship.
    * **D:** Booking quickly might secure a spot, but doesn't help choose the right ship.

Therefore, choosing a company that specializes in Galapagos travel is the most direct way to ensure you are matched with the most suitable ship based on your preferences and needs, as highlighted in the passage.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungasetjentiswa njengelichinga lekugcina tivakashi tigembula?","The correct answer is **C: Tinatfo tekubonga** (Gratuities/Tips).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that establishments often provide ""kudla lokukhetsekile, kwekunatsa nekutijabulisa, kuze bagcine tihambeli tijabulile, futsi tigcineke tikulendzawo"" (special food, treats and entertainment, so that visitors are happy and stay longer) and that ""Letinye tindzawo tiniketa tinatfo letinetjwala endlini"" (Some places offer drinks in-house).  This points to *service* being a key component of keeping customers happy and encouraging tipping. The passage also emphasizes the importance of servers knowing when to stop serving alcohol to prevent overindulgence, implying responsible service is valued.  Tipping is a direct result of good service.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuba nekukhanya kwemvelo lokunyenti** (Having lots of natural light): The passage mentions a lack of windows, so this is unlikely to be a strategy.
*   **B: Tintfo letifana nemathikithi amahhala ekhonsathi** (Things like free concert tickets): While nice, the passage doesn't mention this as a regular practice.
*   **D: Kungabi khona kwemawashi** (Not having clocks): The passage specifically states clocks are *not* usually present, but frames this as a characteristic of the place, not a method to keep guests happy.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini umuntfu logembulako lohlakaniphile lokufanele ayigweme?","The correct answer is **A: Kunatsa kakhulu tjwala** (Drinking too much alcohol).

Here's why:

The passage states that establishments often offer specialized food and entertainment to keep patrons happy and spending. It *also* mentions that some places offer alcohol. Critically, it then states the need to manage how much one consumes and that servers are aware of the importance of guests not becoming intoxicated (""bagembuli bayati kutsi kubaluleke ngani kuhlala bangakadzakwa""). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kwemukela nome ngutiphi tikhutsato** (Accepting any bribes) - The passage doesn't mention bribes.
* **C: Kubuka emawashi** (Looking at watches) - The passage states casinos often *lack* clocks, but doesn't say looking at them is something to avoid.
* **D: Kubuta ngendzawo yekuphuma lesedvute** (Asking about the emergency exit) -  The passage says emergency exits are often obscured, but doesn't say asking about them is unwise.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguyiphi incenye yenkhulumo lebhalwa ngafeleba ekhatsi nemusho?","The correct answer is **A: Tento**.

Here's why:

The passage describes words (""onkhe emagama laseceleni kweligama lelitsi Sie"") that *always* start with capital letters, *even within a sentence*. This is a characteristic of **nouns (Tento)** in SiSwati.  The passage explicitly states this is a way to differentiate nouns from other word classes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Emabito (Verbs):** Verbs don't generally have a consistent capitalization rule like the description in the passage.
* **C: Tibaluli (Adjectives):**  Adjectives also don't have this consistent capitalization rule.
* **D: Tiphawulo (Adverbs):** Similarly, adverbs aren't typically capitalized in this manner.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini kubhala emabito ngabofeleba lokungayenta ibe lukhuni kakhulu?","The correct answer is **C: Kubhala**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ngisho noma kubhala kuba matima..."" which translates to ""...even though writing can be difficult..."".  The passage directly links writing with being challenging due to the capitalization rule.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kufundza (Reading):** While the passage says reading *can* be easier, it doesn't say writing makes reading difficult.
*   **B: Kuhlukanisa tento (Distinguishing meaning):** The passage mentions this is *helped* by the capitalization, not hindered by writing.
*   **D: Kuhlukanisa bosobito (Distinguishing parts of speech):** Similar to B, capitalization assists in this, doesn't create difficulty.



"
"Etincenyeni letisemakhaya teMalaysia, ngusiphi sento lesisho kutsi “kota”?","The correct answer is **A: Kugobisa umunwe wekukhomba** (Curving the index finger).

Here's why:

The passage states that in Malaysia, particularly among locals, ""kota"" refers to a gesture similar to hooking the index finger and pointing it towards the body – a gesture considered rude in many Western cultures.  It's used specifically to beckon someone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kuphakamisa sandla usivilitise** (Raising your hand in greeting) - The passage specifically says raising a hand means ""you are polite"" *elsewhere in the world*, but has a different meaning in Malaysia.
* **C: Kushayanisa timphama tetandla** (Clapping hands) - This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **D: Kukhipha sitfupha** (Taking a breath) - This isn't mentioned in the text.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngusiphi sento lesingase sisho kutsi “buya”?","The correct answer is **B: Kugoba umunwe wekukhomba**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that in Malaysia, gesturing with a raised hand (like a wave in Western cultures) is considered rude and similar to pointing with the index finger at someone's body. It further explains this gesture is used to beckon someone *to come back*. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuphakamisa intsendze yesandla ibuke ngekhatsi** (Raising the palm of the hand facing inwards) - This is the gesture that's *incorrect* in Malaysia.
*   **C: Kuphakamisa intsendze yesandla ibuke ngephandle** (Raising the palm of the hand facing outwards) - While a wave in many cultures, the passage emphasizes it’s impolite in Malaysia.
*   **D: Kuvuma ngenhloko** (Nodding the head) - The passage doesn't mention nodding as having any specific meaning in either Malaysia or Spain.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lebangela kutsi kube netimfa letinkhulu elichweni?","The correct answer is **C: Imihumbe yelichwa lewako**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Emabondza kanye neluphahla lemihume yelichwa angawa kantsi timfa tingavaleka."" This translates to ""The sides and the roof of the cave can collapse and block the passages.""  This directly links the collapses of the cave's structure (mihume - roofs/ceilings) to the blockage of passages, resulting in large, inaccessible caves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngema-snow bridge** (Snow bridges) - The text doesn't mention snow or snow bridges.
* **B: Tinguzunga telichwa letingakatinti** (Unstable cave formations) - While instability is implied, the text specifically points to the *collapse* of the cave's roof/ceilings.
* **D: Lichwa lelingakacini** (An incomplete cave) - The text discusses what happens *within* a large cave, not the state of its formation.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokungafihlwa ngema-snow bridges?","The correct answer is **A: Timfa**.

Here's why:

The text states ""...nekuvuleka kwemhlaba lokungahle kufihlwe mabhuloho elichwa... Emabondza kanye neluphahla lemihume yelichwa angawa kantsi **timfa tingavaleka**.""  This directly says the *timfa* (roots) can be blocked/covered.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Imihume yelichwa:** The text says these *fall* – they aren't hidden.
* **C: Tindvonga:** This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **D: Tigadla letinkhulu telichwa:** This isn't mentioned in the text.

Here's why:

The text states: ""konkhe kuvakashela ngaphandle kwe-Goma kufuna kuhlatiywe kutocondza lesimo sekulwa lesichubekako esifundzaveni saseNyakatfo Kivu."" This directly translates to ""all travel outside of Goma requires caution due to the ongoing conflict in the North Kivu region.""  This means that venturing *outside* the city itself requires safety precautions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: INyiragongo volcano:** While the text mentions the volcano, it doesn't specifically say visitors need extra caution *at* the volcano itself, but rather when travelling in the surrounding region.
*   **C: Inkhaba yelidolobha:** The text doesn’t mention needing special caution within the city limits.
*   **D: IRwanda:** Rwanda is mentioned as being *near* Goma, but the text doesn't suggest any safety concerns specifically for travelling to Rwanda.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungeke kube yithiphu lenhle kumuntfu lovakashela iGoma?,"The correct answer is **A: Timphu letiseNyakatfo YeKivu timnandzi** (Tips for North Kivu are pleasant).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""konkhe kuvakashela ngaphandle kwe-Goma kufuna kuhlatiywe kutocondza lesimo sekulwa lesichubekako esifundzaveni saseNyakatfo Kivu."" This translates to ""all travel outside of Goma requires caution due to the ongoing conflict in the North Kivu region.""  Therefore, suggesting tips for North Kivu are *pleasant* is misleading and not helpful, as it downplays the danger.

Let's look at why the other options are good tips based on the text:

*   **B: Yindzawo lekahle naleshiphile Yekucaca Intsaba Ubuke Emagorila** (It is a good place and a viewing point for mountain gorillas) – The text mentions Goma as a base for exploring Virunga National Park, where mountain gorillas are found.
*   **C: Ematekisi etidududu ayindlela lekahle yekuhamba** (Motorcycle taxis are a good way to get around) – The text directly suggests using ""boda-boda"" (motorcycle taxis) for transportation within Goma.
*   **D: Incenye lephansi yentsabamlilo iNyiragongo itfolakala edolobheni** (Part of the Nyiragongo volcano is located in the city) - The text states Goma is a base for visiting the Nyiragongo volcano.



"
Kunini lapho itotfolakala khona imvume yasendzaweni yasemakhaya yelilanga lekucala nga-August?,"The correct answer is **B: Nga-April 1**.

Here's why:

The passage states permits become available ""four months after the first of the month."" If you want a permit for August 1st, you need to calculate four months *before* August.

* August - 1 month = July
* July - 1 month = June
* June - 1 month = May
* May - 1 month = April

Therefore, the permits are available on April 1st."

Here's why:

* The text states, ""Sikhala setindzawo letidvume kakhulu... imvamisa sigcwaliswa ticelo letitfolwe ngelusuku letivulwa ngalo kuze kufakwe ticelo."" This directly means popular campsites are filled by those who apply *first*.

* **B: Timvume titfolakala kuphela ngaJanuary 1** (Permits are only available on January 1) - The text says permits become available on January 1st *four months after the first of the month*, not that they are *only* available then.
* **C: Timvume titrolakala kuphela ngeticelo letentiwa matfupha** (Permits are only controlled by applications made in person) - The text doesn't specify *how* applications must be made, only that demand is high.
* **D: Timvume timbalwa** (There are few permits) - The text doesn't state the number of permits is small, only that there's a *limit* and popular spots fill up quickly.  A limit doesn't mean few exist, just that there’s a maximum.

Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokunematfuba lamancane ekutsi kutfolakale eluhlotjeni lwemahhotela lachazwe kulesicephu?,"The correct answer is **D: Emagumbi lasandza kulungiswa atfutfukiswa ngendlela yesimanje** (Recently renovated rooms furnished in a modern style).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that these hotels were characterized by *not* having modern conveniences and by *having* antique elements. Modern, renovated rooms are the opposite of what would be found in these historic hotels.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Libhala lema-cocktail (Cocktail bar):** While not a defining feature, cocktail bars were common in upscale hotels of the time.
*   **B: Indzawo yekudlela ye-gourmet (Gourmet dining room):**  These hotels were described as offering ""comfortable lodging and a pleasant evening,"" suggesting good dining would be available.
*   **C: Tivakashi letatiwako naleticashelwako (Famous and respected guests):** The passage mentions presidents and important people sometimes stayed at these hotels, making this a possible characteristic.



Therefore, **D** is the most unlikely feature of the hotels described."
"Ngekuya ngekwatiswa lokukulesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako tivakashi tasehhotela lokunematfuba lamancane ekutsi tikubeke embili?","The correct answer is **A: Imphahla yakudzala kuyo yonkhe indzawo** (Antique furnishings throughout).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that these hotels were characterized by their **old-fashioned nature** and the presence of **antique items**.  It specifically states that the lack of modern amenities and the presence of things from the past were *part of their charm*.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Sitolo sekudlela lesinashefu lovelele** (A restaurant with an excellent chef) - While nice, the passage focuses on the overall atmosphere and historical aspect, not specifically the food quality.
* **C: Indzawo yekuphumula lenetekutijabulisa kwasebusuku** (A lounge area with nightly entertainment) - The passage mentions a pleasant stay but doesn't highlight entertainment as a key feature.
* **D: Emanani lafinyelelelako emagumbi** (Affordable room rates) - The passage suggests these hotels catered to wealthy travelers (""a wealthy traveler could choose a round-the-world flight..."") and even hosted presidents, implying they weren't necessarily budget-friendly.  It also states that while generally for those who could afford it, important people *were* housed there.

"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lokufanele igwenywe tivakashi letivakashela iGreenland?","The correct answer is **D: Kubhekisela kubantfu bemdzabu baseGreenland ngekutsi ngema-”Eskimo”**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: *""Noma nje leligama """"Eskimo"""" lisavumeleka eMelika, litfolakala liyinhlamba kubantfu base-Artic labangabo baseMelika, ikakhulu eKhanada...kusetjentiswa kwalo kufanele bantfu lababuya kulamanye emave bakugweme.""*  This directly advises visitors to avoid using the term ""Eskimo"" when referring to the Indigenous people of Greenland.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the text mentions crime, it doesn't say tourists should *avoid* specific areas, only that it's less common in Greenland and that ""violent areas"" exist even in towns.
*   **B:** The text advises bringing *warm* clothing, not packing light for heat.
*   **C:** The text states internet access is widely available, not unreliable.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokunematfuba lamanyenti ekutsi kube yinkinga kubantfu labavakashela iGreenland bangakatilungiseleli?","The correct answer is **C: Simo selitulu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Simo selitulu kuphela kwengoti labangakalungeli labatobhekana nayo."" (The climate is the only thing unprepared people will face.) It also mentions the need for warm clothing in winter and potential sleep problems due to long daylight hours in summer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Timbuzulwne lokutsiwa ngemaNordic:** While mentioned, the passage states it's *annoying* not dangerous (""iyanyanyisana"").
*   **B: Bugebengu:** The passage says crime is *less common* in Greenland than for visitors from other countries.
*   **D: Bantfu bendzawo:** The passage discusses cultural sensitivity regarding names but doesn't suggest locals are a threat to visitors.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako nyalo lokusetjentiswa njengendzawo yetitolo?,"The correct answer is **A: I-Jardín de la Unión**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nyalo kusebenta njengeplaza lesemkhatsini..."" which translates to ""Currently it functions as a central plaza...""  A plaza is a public square or open space used for gatherings and events – essentially a central location. The text specifically says the Jardín de la Unión *is* this plaza.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I-Alley of the Kiss (Callejon del Beso)** - The text describes it as a narrow passage known for a romantic legend, not a central gathering place.
* **C: I-Templo de San Diego** - The text says it's *one of the buildings that remains* within the Jardín de la Unión, not the plaza itself.
* **D: I-Callejon del Beso** - Same reasoning as option B.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungatfolakali e-Jardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **A: Lithende leliphakatsi lelinemakhonsthi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nawubanike nje emasetjana lamancane labanye bantfwana bangakucocela indzaba."" (If you just give a few cents, some children can tell you a story.) This implies small tips for stories, *not* a formal church collection.
* **The passage mentions:**
    * **B:** Callejon del Beso is the home of a famous old love story.
    * **C:** ""Kunetidzawo letinyenti tekudlela letiseceleni kwalengadze"" (There are many restaurants alongside the square.)
    * **D:** ""lomkhatsi wakhiwa indlu yebaPhristi yangelikhulu lesi-17 leminyaka, lapho iTemplo de San Diego kungiso sodvwa sakhiwo lesisele."" (the square was built by a priest in the 17th century, where the Templo de San Diego is one of the remaining buildings). This indicates a historical religious building.

Therefore, a church *collection* is the only option not directly mentioned or implied in the text.

"Ngalokusekelwe kulesicephu, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako mayelana neluhambo lwelilanga langase atsatfwe njengalangasilo liciniso?","The correct answer is **D: Kuhamba emini akusiyo intfo lekahle leyentiwa ngaphandle kumindeni lenebantfwana.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Imindeni lenebantfwana labancane ingase idzinge kulungiselela kakhudlwana, futsi noma ngubani lophilile ngekwelizinga lelisesilinganisweni angakujabulela.""  This means even families with young children *can* enjoy a day hike with a little extra preparation.  The statement in option D directly contradicts this.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

*   **A: Kuncane kutilungiselela lokudzingekako nawutohamba endleleni lemelula** - The passage says ""Kukhuphuka intsaba lilanga lonkhe uhamba endzaweni lengasimatima kangako kudzinga kulungiselela lokuncane"" which supports this.
*   **B: Emabanga ayashiyana, kodvwa entelwe kutsi ahlanganiswe ngelilanga linye** - The passage states ""Lilanga lekuyokhwela intsaba lihlanganisa libanga lelingaphansi kwelimayela kuya emabangeni lamadze langahanjwa ngelilanga linye.""
*   **C: Bantfu labanelizinga lelilinganiselwe lekucina emtimbeni bavamise kukujabulela** - The passage says ""noma ngubani lophilile ngekwelizinga lelisesilinganisweni angakujabulela.""



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kunini lapho luhambo lwasemini ludzinga khona kutilungiselela lokuncane?","The correct answer is **A: Nangabe loyo lohambako acinile emtimbeni** (If the hiker is in reasonably good physical condition).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kukhuphuka intsaba lilanga lonkhe uhamba endzaweni lengasimatima kangako kudzinga kulungiselela lokuncane, futsi noma ngubani lophilile ngekwelizinga lelisesilinganisweni angakujabulela.""  This translates to: ""Hiking a mountain all day and walking in not-too-difficult terrain requires little preparation, and anyone in reasonably good physical condition can enjoy it.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage doesn't say difficult trails require *less* preparation.
*   **C:** The passage specifically mentions families with young children might need *more* preparation.
*   **D:** The passage describes hiking in *natural areas*, not artificial ones.



"
Uyini umehluko etsafeni laseRogaland nome Agder nalicatsaniswa nayo yonkhe iNorway?,"The correct answer is **A: Linetihlahla** (It has forests).

Here's why:

The text states: ""ERogaland nase-Agder ngalokuvamile abitwa ngekutsi """"hei"""" lokusho indzawo lete tihlahla lembonywe timbhali.""  This translates to ""Rogaland and Agder are often called """"hei"""" which means an area with forests grown with heather.""

This directly contrasts with the description of Norway generally as a ""vidde"" – a large, open landscape with little vegetation.  Therefore, the key difference is the presence of forests in Rogaland and Agder.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kute ema-fjords** (It has fjords) - The text doesn't mention fjords specifically differentiating these regions.
* **C: Ematsafa sikhatsi lesinyenti ayalingana** (The areas are often equal) - The text focuses on *differences* in landscape, not equality.
* **D: Sikhatsi lesinyenti avalwe sitjalo lokutsiwa yi-heather** (It is often covered in plants called heather) – While heather *grows* in the forests, the defining characteristic is the forests themselves, not simply the heather.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kulolu lokulandzelako lokungeke kube ngulokujwayelekile ngeNorway?","The correct answer is **B: Ematsafa emahlatsi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Norway as having ""vidde"" – large, open spaces with sparse vegetation.** This aligns with options A (open land) and D (moorland - which is a type of open, heathland).
* **It also mentions ""hei"" – forested areas with low-growing trees.** This implies forests are common.
* **""Fjords"" (C) are specifically mentioned as being located at the top of the mountains.**
* **However, the passage *doesn't* describe Norway as having lush forests (""ematsafa emahlatsi"").** It describes *sparse* vegetation in the ""vidde"" and low-growing trees in the ""hei"" - not dense forests.

Therefore, lush forests would be the least typical landscape feature of Norway according to this text.

Kunini lapho tivakashi letinesifiso sekuntjuza echweni letingavakashela khona titeshi letisegcumeni?,"The correct answer is **A: Ebusika (Winter)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kodvwa, kunebuhle nekutsandzeka lokuhlukile ebusika, titeshi temadvwala titfola sitfwatfwa lesanele futsi kunetintfo letinengi longatenta kufaka ekhatsi imidlalo yasesitfwatfweni.""  (But, there is beauty and a different charm in winter, the mountain slopes get enough snow and there are many things that make it worth participating in snow sports.)

This clearly indicates that winter is the best time to visit the mountains for snow-related activities.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kunini lapho kuba netivakashi letinyenti khona etiteshini letisegcumeni?","The correct answer is **C: Ngesikhatsi selihloba laseNdiya**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Linani letivakashi letiya endzaweni lesemagcumeni yaseNdiya tiba tinyenti **ehlobo**."" (Many tourists come to the mountainous regions of India **in the summer**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngesikhatsi selichwa lelinamandla** - The passage mentions winter, but not specifically strong snowfall as a peak tourist time.
*   **B: Kuso sonkhe sikhatsi sekuntjweza echweni** - The passage doesn't indicate tourism is consistent year-round.
*   **D: Kuto tonkhe tinyanga tasebusika** - The passage actually contrasts the busy summer with the quieter winter.

Yini lokufanele ugweme kuyenta nawunelitsemba lekutfola sikebhe lesifuna lusito?,"The correct answer is **C: Kukhangisa ngemsebenti lowentako** (Bragging about the work you can do).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes being helpful, observing, and letting people *offer* you work.  Bragging would be pushy and likely turn people off. The goal is to be seen as willing to help, not to boast about skills.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kwehla wenyuka kuma-dock** (Walking up and down the docks) - This is a normal part of looking for work and observing.
* **B: Kutayelana nabokaputeni** (Chatting with captains) -  The passage *encourages* talking to people.
* **D: Kungabanaki labanye labacela kugibela tikebhe** (Not being among many asking to crew boats) -  The passage encourages speaking to *many* people, not avoiding them.



"
Yini lokufanele uyente nawuseceleni kwebashayeli betikebhe nawusafuna tikembe letidzinga lusito endzaweni yekupaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Chumana nebashayeli bemikhumbi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""utame kukhuluma nebashayeli bemikhumbi endzaweni letsengisa tjwala"" - which translates to ""try to talk to the boat drivers in the docking area"".  This directly encourages interaction with the drivers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hlala ungabonakali (Stay unnoticed):** The passage encourages being proactive and helpful, not hiding.
* **C: Yani kuphela kubantfu nabasahlala tikebhe tabo (Only speak to people who are still on their boats):** The passage suggests speaking to *many* people, including those helping with the boats.
* **D: Gwema kucela kugibela kuletinye tikebhe (Avoid asking for a ride on other boats):** While the main goal is to find a boat needing help, avoiding all conversation isn't the primary instruction.

Nguyiphi indzawo lengakhanga tivakashi letinesifiso sekutfola umlandvo wekubuswa kwesichingi?,"The correct answer is **C: Inkhaba yelidolobha laseHong Kong**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lena yindzawo lapho baseBrithani labangena ngenkhani kuyo bayenta yabo ngako ngangabe ufuna bufakazi balendzawo kutsi yatsatfwa ngubani ekucaleni, lena yindzawo lekahle longacala kuyo."" This directly translates to: ""This is the place where the British entered and made it their own. If you want proof from locals about who colonized it first, this is a good place to start.""  

This clearly refers to the core of Hong Kong city as the historical entry point for British colonization.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lugu loluseNyakatfo (Northern Point)** - The passage mentions the waterfront but doesn't specifically tie it to the *beginning* of British colonization.
*   **B: Indzawo lengaselwandle lokutsitwa yi-Kowloon (Kowloon waterfront)** - While Kowloon is mentioned, the historical entry and colonization are linked to Hong Kong Island itself.
*   **D: Sikhumulo semikhumbi lokutsiwa yi-Victoria Harbor (Victoria Harbor)** - Victoria Harbor is a landmark, but the passage points to the land area *where* the British initially landed and established control.



"
Nguyiphi indzawo lengakhanga sivakashi lesitsandza indzawo lenhle?,"The correct answer is **C: I-Hong Kong Island**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Sichingi iHong Kong sinika lensimu yaseHong Kong ligama layo futsi siyindzawo tivakashi letiningi letiyibuka njengaleyo letifuna kuyinaka nakakhulu nativakashile."" This translates to ""Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong its name and is a place many tourists look for and want to visit.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sikhumulo semikhumbi lokutsiwa yi-Victoria Harbor (Victoria Harbour)** - While beautiful, the passage mentions Victoria Harbour as a feature *of* Hong Kong Island, not the island itself being the ideal place for tourists.
*   **B: I-Hong Kong proper** - This is a vague term and doesn't pinpoint a specific location described as ideal for tourists in the passage.
*   **D: Indzawo lengaselwandle lokutsitwa yi-Kowloon (The waterfront area facing Kowloon)** - The passage *also* mentions Kowloon waterfront, but it's presented as a continuation *after* visiting Hong Kong Island.

Yini letinye tihlalo temahhashi letinayo kuze tivikele kutsi lunyawo lwemgibeli lubanjwe yifulemu yekufaka tinyawo?,"The correct answer is **B: Tindvuku tekuphepha (Safety stirrups)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...tihlalo, kakhulu tihlalo taseNgilandi, tinemigoco yekuphepha lebangela kutsi situbhu sesikhumba siwe kulesihlalo uma sidvonselwa emuva ngumgibeli lowako."" This translates to ""...saddles, especially English saddles, have safety loops that cause the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle if pulled backwards by the rider.""  These ""migoco yekuphepha"" are safety stirrups (or stirrup bars/loops) designed to release the foot in case of a fall, preventing it from getting stuck.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Emasoli lamancane (Small soles)** - Soles don't prevent the foot from being *trapped* in the stirrup.
*   **C: Emafulemu ekufaka tinyawo lentiwe ngesikhumba (Leather stirrup irons)** - These are part of the stirrup, but don't actively prevent trapping.
*   **D: Kutinta lokukhulu (Larger tint)** - This is irrelevant to stirrup safety.



"
Ngusiphi sici selibhudzi lemgibeli welihhasi lesikhulisa lizinga lekuphepha nakasebentisa emafulemu ekufaka tinyawo?,"The correct answer is **C: Sitsendze**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kwekucala, bagibeli labanyenti bagcoka **emabhudze lanesitsedze**."" (Firstly, many riders wear **close-fitting boots**).  Close-fitting boots are crucial for safety when using stirrups because they prevent the foot from slipping through the stirrup in case of a fall, as described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isoli lencane, lehhedlako (Small, smooth sole):** While a sole is part of a boot, the passage emphasizes the *fit* of the boot, not the sole's characteristics.
*   **B: Sikhumba (Leather):** Leather is a material boots can be *made of*, but it doesn't directly enhance safety with stirrups.
*   **D: Isoli levulekile (Open sole):** An open sole would be *more* dangerous, as it would increase the risk of a foot getting caught.

Yini leniketwa tivakashi kusetjentiswa emanethiwekhi etekuvakasha?,"The correct answer is **A: Tindzawo tekuhlala lapho labanakekela tivakashi kubantfu bendzawo** (Accommodation provided by locals for visitors).

Here's why:

The passage states that the network connects tourists with locals in the cities they visit. The example of Casey Fenton highlights the problem of finding affordable accommodation, and the network solves this by connecting him with locals offering places to stay.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tindiza letishiphile** (Cheaper flights) - The passage doesn't mention anything about flights.
*   **C: Kuvakashiswa bantfu bendzawo** (Being toured by locals) - While interaction with locals is part of the experience, the primary service is the accommodation.
*   **D: Kuhlangana nalabanye nabo labavakashele indzawo lefanako** (Meeting others who have visited the same place) - This *could* be a byproduct of using the network, but isn't its core function.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kujoyina le-network kudzinga nje kugcwalisa lifomu nge-inthanethi; **noma lamanye ema-network aniketa noma adzinga lolunye luhlolo.**"" This directly supports the idea that some networks may require additional verification.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the network *connects* tourists with locals, the text doesn't say tourists are *always* given information about them.
*   **C:** The passage mentions lists of hosts exist, but doesn't guarantee tourists are given a list to choose from.
*   **D:** The passage doesn’t specifically state that reviews of locals helping tourists are available; it mentions lists being reviewed *by* visitors.

"Ngekwalesicephu, nguluphi luhlobo lwesivakashi lokunematfuba lamancane kutsi ungalutfola egumbini lelihlanganyelwako?","The correct answer is **C: Sivakashi lesihamba nebantfwana labancane** (A visitor traveling with small children).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Imindeni lenebantfwana ayikavami kubonakala, kodvwa lamanye emahhotela ayabavumela kutsi bangene emakamelweni latsite."" This translates to: ""Families with children are not often seen, but some hotels allow them to enter small rooms.""  This directly indicates that families with small children are *less common* guests at this hotel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sivakashi lesisekucaleni kweminyaka yemashumi lamabili** - The passage says this is the *most common* type of visitor.
* **B: Sivakashi lesihamba sodvwana** - The passage doesn't mention anything about solo travelers.
* **D: Sivakashi lesisemkhatsini weminyaka yemashumi lamatsatfu** - The passage mentions older visitors *can* be found, but doesn't say they are rare.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Emahostela anaka kakhulu bantfu labasha - luhlobo lwetivakasha letivamile tiseminyakeni yemashumi lamabili..."" (Hostels mainly cater to young people - a type of traveller common in their twenties...). This directly indicates that young adults in their twenties are the most likely to stay at this type of hostel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Titsandzani letineluswane** - The passage focuses on younger travellers.
*   **C: Titsandzani letiseminyakeni yabo-70** - The passage mentions that older tourists *can* be found there, but they aren't the primary target.
*   **D: Imindeni lemibili lehamba nebantfwana bayo** - The passage states families with children are *not commonly seen* at these hostels.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states:** ""Nangabe ufuna kufundza kujikijela iboomerang lebuyela esandleni sakho..."" This directly relates to the idea of a well-thrown boomerang returning to the thrower.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Yetayeleke kakhulu kubantfu bendzawo kunasetivakashini** - The passage doesn't focus on *who* throws boomerangs, but on whether they return.
*   **C: Akasimanyenti ema-boomerang latfolakalako e-Australia** - The passage states many Australian boomerangs *don't* return, making this option incorrect.
*   **D: Ngulamanye ema-boomerang kuphela lakhona kubuya** - The passage doesn't imply it's only *some* boomerangs that return, but that a good one *should* return with a proper throw.

Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokusetjentiswa kakhulu ekudleni kwesiJavanese?,"The correct answer is **C: Shukela wekhokhonathi**. 

The text specifically states: ""...cuisine yaseJavane ihlanganisa kudla lokuningi lokunongwe kalula, tinambitfo letihamba embili emaJavane lakatitsandzako ngemantongomane, pelepele, **shukela (ngalokukhetsekile shukela wekhokhonathi waseJavane)** neletinye letinengi tipayisi letine-aromethi.""

This means brown sugar (shukela wekhokhonathi) is particularly favored in Javanese cuisine.

"Ngekwalesicephu, sifo lesitsatsalwanako sandza kanjani?","The correct answer is **B: Emagciwane lokutsiwa ngema-pathogen** (Microorganisms called pathogens).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sifo lesitsatselwanako sifo lesibangwa ligciwane kungaba yivariyasi ibhakthiriya ifangasi noma tilwanyana letimunya ingati."" This translates to ""An infectious disease is a disease caused by microorganisms, which can be a virus, bacteria, fungus or other parasites.""  Pathogens *are* these microorganisms that cause disease.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngebantfu labanaso** (By people who have it) - While people *spread* infectious diseases, they aren't the *cause* of the disease itself.
* **C: Ema-Bacterium** (Bacteria) - Bacteria are *a type* of microorganism that can cause infectious disease, but the passage lists viruses, fungi, and parasites as well.  It's too specific.
* **D: Kugoma** (Vaccination) - Vaccination *prevents* infectious diseases; it doesn't explain what they *are*.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lebeyingatiwa kutsi ibangela sifo lesitsatselwanako?","The correct answer is **B: Emagciwane**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sifo lesitsatselwanako sifo lesibangwa **ligciwane** kungaba yivariyasi ibhakthiriya ifangasi noma tilwanyana letimunya ingati.""  This directly translates to ""A communicable disease is a disease caused by **germs**, which may be a variation of bacteria, fungus, or other small animals.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kugoma (Coughing):** Coughing can *spread* disease, but isn't the *cause* of the disease itself.
*   **C: Emabhakthira (Bacteria):** Bacteria are *a type* of germ that can cause communicable diseases, but the text lists germs as the broader cause.
*   **D: Kukhuntsa (Sneezing):** Similar to coughing, sneezing spreads disease, but isn't the origin.

Kukusiphi simo lapho kukhetsa khona i-web proxy kune-VPN kwenele kumuntfu?,"The correct answer is **C: Lomuntfu ngalokuyinhloko ukhatsateke ngekuhambiswa kwatiswa kwe-http.**

Here's why:

* **The passage highlights that web proxies are good at handling HTTP traffic.** It specifically states they can bypass restrictions related to how internet lines transmit data (not just HTTP).
* **VPNs are presented as offering broader benefits** – better security, stronger encryption, and making tracking harder. These are relevant for concerns in options A, B, and D.
* **If the *main* concern is simply getting around HTTP-specific restrictions,** a web proxy is sufficient. It addresses the core issue the passage identifies proxies as being good at.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Umuntfu ufuna kuphambukisa konkhe kwatiswa** (The person wants to bypass everything) - A VPN is better for this as it encrypts all traffic.
* **B: Umuntfu ukhatsate kakhulu ngekuvinjelwa nekuhlolwa kwetintfo takhe** (The person is very concerned about censorship and monitoring) - A VPN provides stronger security and anonymity, making it better for this.
* **D: Lokwentiwa ngulomuntfu kudzinga i-bandwidth lenemandla lasetulu ngalokusesilinganisweni** (What the person is doing requires high bandwidth) -  While some proxies *can* be fast, bandwidth isn't the defining advantage mentioned in the passage about proxies versus VPNs.

The passage states: ""Emalayini e-Inthaneti bawahambisa ngalenye indlela, hhayi nje kuphela i-http."" (Online lines transport differently, not just http.) This directly contradicts the claim that VPNs *only* handle http traffic.  VPNs encrypt *all* internet traffic, not just HTTP.

Let's look at why the other options are likely true (and therefore *not* the incorrect statement):

*   **A: Ngalokuvamile ema-VPN aniketa i-bandwidth lesetulu kunema-web proxies** - The passage mentions VPNs offer higher and more stable support, implying better bandwidth.
*   **B: Ema-web proxies angeke akhone kuhambisa konkhe kwatiswa** - The passage states that web proxies have many limitations.
*   **C: Ema-web proxies anekhwalithi lephansi nakacatsaniswa nema-VPN** - The passage describes VPNs as being harder to trace and having high-level support which supports the idea that they are better quality.

Yini levumela umuntfu kutsi asebentise inkapani yelucingo ngephandle kwendzawo lahlala kuyo?,"The correct answer is **A: Tincingo letihanjiswa nge-inthanethi** (Internet-based phone services).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ngoba tincingo tihlanganiswe ne-Inthanethi, akunasidzingo sekutsi usebentise lucingo lenkhampani yalapho uhlala khona noma lapho uvakasha khona."" This directly explains that internet connectivity is what allows you to use a phone service regardless of your location.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tinombolo tetincingo temhlaba wonkhe (International phone numbers):** While necessary *to receive* calls from traditional phone systems (PSTN), it's the internet connection enabling the service, not the international number itself, that allows for location independence.
* **C: Emasethelayithi (Addresses):** Addresses are irrelevant to the functionality of a phone.
* **D: Tincingo tema-PSTN (PSTN phones):** PSTN phones are traditional landlines and *require* a local area code, contradicting the passage's point about being location independent.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lokungase kudzingeke yentiwe kuze kungene letinye tincingo?","The correct answer is **A: Tsenga inombolo yemhlaba wonkhe**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Esikhatsini lesinyenti, kufuneka utsenge inombolo yamhlabawonkhe levumela tincingo tePSTN kutsi tikushayele."" (Often, you need to purchase an international number to allow PSTN phones to call you.) This directly answers the question of what needs to be done to allow other phones to reach you.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sebentisa inkapani yetincingo yasendzaweni (Use a local phone company):** The passage is about *avoiding* the need for a local phone company due to internet-based calling.
*   **C: Tfola inombolo endzaweni yakini (Get a number in your area):** The passage explains how you *don't* need a number in your area, you can get one from anywhere.
*   **D: Tsenga lucingo lwe-PSTN (Buy a PSTN phone):** The passage is about using internet-based phones *instead* of traditional PSTN phones.

Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungayichazi kahle indlela yekubita emagama esiTaliyane?,"The correct answer is **C: Emagama lanetinhlavu c na-g ayadidana**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that the pronunciation of 'c' and 'g' is *different* depending on the following letter.  Option C says they are *the same*, which directly contradicts the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bo-r lababili babitwa ngendlela leyehlukule ku-r munye:** The passage *does* mention the difference between single 'r' and double 'rr' pronunciation.
* **B: Linyenti lemagama libitwa ngendlela lelibhalwe ngayo:** The passage states the opposite – that many words are *not* pronounced as they are written.
* **D: Indlela emagama lamanyenti labitwa ngayo iyahluka kuye ngankhamisa lolandzelako:** The passage supports this statement; it highlights how the next letter changes the pronunciation of 'c' and 'g'.

Ngutiphi kuletici letilandzelako te-Izmir lesavela ngembi kwesikhatsi samanje?,"The correct answer is **D: Luphahla lolunemathayizi labovu** (The roof with blue tiles).

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions: ""imigwaco lemikhulu, emabhilidi lafakwe emafasitela lamakhulu netakhiwo tetitolo tekutsenga tesimanje tifakwe **luphahla lelunemachashati labovu emdzabu**"" (the main streets, buildings covered with large windows and modern shopping title structures are covered with **a roof with blue tiles**). This detail is presented as a characteristic feature of modern İzmir.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Titaladi letinkhulu letinetihlahla** (Large squares with trees) - While İzmir might have these, the passage doesn't specifically highlight them as a defining modern feature.
*   **B: Takhiwo letakhiwe ngengilazi ngembili** (Buildings built with double glass) - This is a feature of modern buildings generally, but not specific to İzmir as mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Tikhungo tekutsenga** (Shopping centers) - The passage states İzmir *is* a shopping center, but that's a general description, not a specific modern characteristic highlighted in the text.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungasiso sici lesiliciniso nge-Izmir?,"The correct answer is **C: Ungatfola kokubili tikhungo tekutsenga tesimanje kanye nemasontfo lamadzala** (You can find both modern shopping centers and old mansions).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""...netindlu letindzala letisontsela kito emaSulumane kanye nemasontfo lamadzala, noma-nje lelidolobha linemoya waseYurophu YaseMedithera kudlula owendzabuko yaseTurkey.""  (and old houses reflecting both Muslim and ancient traditions, although the city has a Mediterranean European atmosphere rather than a traditional Turkish one). It also mentions ""takhiwo tetitolo tekutsenga tesimanje"" (modern shopping structures).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lelidolobha litungelete ibhayi lenkhulu** (The city is situated in a large bay) - While true, this is only *one* detail of many.
* **B: Simo siveta iTurkey yemdzabu** (The city represents traditional Turkey) - The passage explicitly states the opposite: it has a more European Mediterranean atmosphere *than* traditional Turkey.
* **D: Inesikhu,mulo semikhulu lesisesibili ngebukhulu eTurkey** (It has the second largest port in Turkey) - While also true, it's just one fact amongst others and not the most comprehensive description offered in the passage.



"
Ligama lelitsi hanami libhekisela ekubukeni ini?,"The correct answer is **A: Ema-cherry blossoms**.

Here's why:

The passage states that *hanami* is a Japanese tradition from the 8th century involving viewing flowers. While it originated with plum blossoms in China, in Japan it became associated with cherry blossoms (timbali tetihlahla letinyenti). The passage describes *hanami* as a flower viewing, and the context points to cherry blossoms being the flowers viewed in Japan.



"
Ngubani lowabamba imicimbi yekucala leyayentelwe kubukwa kwema-cherry blossoms?,"The correct answer is **C: Umbusi waseJapane** (The Emperor of Japan).

Here's why:

The text states: ""EJapan, emaphathi ekucala umhleli wawo bekuba ngumbusi atentela yena lephathi nalamanye emalunga ebukhosi eceleni kweNkantolo Yasebukhosini."" This directly translates to ""In Japan, the first parties were led by the emperor who held the party with other members of the royal family near the Imperial Court.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umbusi waseChina** - The text says the *tradition* originated in China with plum blossoms, but the Japanese *hanami* parties were led by the Japanese emperor.
*   **B: Bantfu labakhulu baseJapane** - While many people participated, the emperor *led* the initial events.
*   **D: Bantfu labakhulu baseChina** - Similar to option A, this refers to the origin of the tradition, not who held the first Japanese hanami parties.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngusiphi kuletici letilandzelako teJerusalema lokunematfuba lamancane ekutsi sikhange tivakashi?","The correct answer is **B: Kuba kwalo lidolobha lelikhulu ka-Israyeli**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""IJerusalema inemlandvo lomningi, tinsalo letimbiwe netindzawo temasiko, kuhlanganise netitolo letigcwele letiphitsitelako, emakhefi, netindzawo tekudlela."" and “IJerusalema iyindzawo leyinhloko yebavakashi kwa-Israyeli.” This directly links the city's status as Israel's capital (even with international dispute) to its popularity with tourists.  While the religious significance and history are important, the passage emphasizes that *because* it's a major city, it attracts tourists.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Kubaluleka kwalelidolobha kutenkholo:** While very important, the passage states religious significance *leads to* tourism, it isn’t the core reason people visit.
*   **C: Emasiko alo:**  The passage mentions culture, but doesn’t highlight it as the primary draw for visitors.
*   **D: Tindzawo letinyenti temlandvo:** Again, history is important, but the passage frames it as part of the overall appeal *because* it is a major city.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungakashiwo kulesicephu njengentfo iJerusalema leyatiwa ngayo?,"The correct answer is **B: Emandla ayo kutepolitiki**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states:** ""IJerusalema inhloko dolobha nelidolobha lelikhulu ka-Israyeli, noma nje lamanye emave Nenhlangano Yetive Letihlangene angaliboni njengenhloko dolobha yaka-Israyeli."" (Jerusalem is the capital and largest city of Israel, but many countries and the United Nations do not recognize it as the capital of Israel.) This highlights the political dispute and contested status of Jerusalem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umlandvo wayo lomangalisako** (Its amazing history) - The passage *does* mention its history, but it's presented as a fact, not something it's contested *for*.
*   **C: Kubaluleka kwayo kutenkholo** (Its religious importance) - The passage emphasizes Jerusalem's religious importance, but this is presented as a defining characteristic, not a point of contention.
*   **D: Tindzawo temasiko** (Cultural sites) - Like the history, cultural sites are mentioned, but not as a primary reason it's significant or disputed.

"Ngekwalesicephu, nguluphi luhlobo lwesivakashi lolungeke luzuze ngekutsenga i-Wild Card?","The correct answer is **B: Sivakashi lesivakashela i-Kruger National Park kuphela**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Wild Card ""makes it possible to enter selected parks in South Africa or all SANParks parks in South Africa.""  If someone *only* visits Kruger National Park, the Wild Card doesn't offer them any additional benefit because they can already pay the entry fee for just that park.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** A visitor planning to visit many SANParks *would* benefit from a Wild Card.
* **C:** A visitor concerned about park costs *would* benefit from a Wild Card if they visit multiple parks.
* **D:** A visitor planning to visit Kruger and at least one other park *would* definitely benefit from a Wild Card.



"
Ngumaphi emavi langayichazi kahle i-Kruger National Park?,"The correct answer is **A: Ibhekwa njengendzawo lehamba embili eNingizimu Afrikha ngekukhanga tivakashi** (It is considered a two-way destination in South Africa due to attracting tourists).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ngulenye yetindzawo letitsakatelisako eNingizimu Afrika futsi itsatfwa njengendzawo lenhle kumaPaki Esive aseNingizimu Afrika (SANParks).""  This translates to ""It is one of the most popular destinations in South Africa and is regarded as a prime destination for South African National Parks (SANParks)."" This directly supports the idea of it being a major tourist attraction and a ""two-way"" destination (attracting people *to* South Africa).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tilwane tiyehlukahlukana etindzaweni letinyenti talephaki** (Animals are diverse in many areas of the park) - While true (the passage mentions different wildlife in each of the 14 sections), it doesn’t *define* Kruger National Park. It’s a characteristic, but not its primary identifying feature.
* **C: Iyiphaki lencane kunato tonkhe e-South African National Parks** (It is the smallest park of all the South African National Parks) - The passage states the park is 19,500 km², which is substantial and unlikely to be the smallest.
* **D: Tivakashi tiyakhona kungena kuyo ngekutsi titsenge i-Wild Card** (Tourists can enter it by purchasing a Wild Card) - The passage mentions a Wild Card *can* be used, but doesn’t define the park *by* that entry method. It's a convenience, not a defining characteristic.

Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungenteka kubangele ingoti kubantfu labacancako kuto tonkhe tincenye talentsaba letehlela kakhulu?,"The correct answer is **A: Kuba manti**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""njengoba kungaba yingoti masinyane"" (as it can become slippery quickly) *when there is water*.  This directly links water to the risk of slipping and falling.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ematje lokuhanjwa kuwo (The dirt walked on):** While the path is described as dusty, the passage doesn't say this causes slipping.
*   **C: Imihume lemincane (Small caves):** The passage describes having to carefully navigate a narrow passage, but doesn't say it's slippery.
*   **D: Emakhebuli ensimbi (Steel cables):** The steel cables *help* with safety by providing something to hold onto.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Kunemhume lomncane eceleni kwalapha etulu lokufanele wendlule kuwo, uphansi futsi kufanele utiminye kuze ungene kuwo."" (There is a small tunnel on the side of the top that you must pass through, low and you must bend to enter it.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngisho nebacanci labanemandla kungenteka baphelelwe ngumoya** (Even strong climbers can get out of breath) - While the passage *mentions* getting out of breath, it doesn't focus on it as a key challenge.
* **B: Kute kwekubambelela kuto tonkhe tincenye letehlelako** (There is support throughout the steep parts) - The passage mentions ropes for support in *some* areas, but not *throughout* all steep parts.
* **D: Tindzawo letehlelako tiba yingoti masinyane** (The steep parts become slippery when wet) - The passage says the path can become slippery *if* it’s wet, but doesn’t state the steep parts themselves *are* slippery.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungasiyo intfo lehamba embili ekudleni kwesi-Majorcan ?","The correct answer is **C: Lokusanhlavu**.

Here's why:

The passage states Majorcan cuisine includes bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil extensively. It *specifically* mentions *Pa amb Oli* – bread with oil, tomatoes, and other toppings. 

Lokusanhlavu (dessert) is **not** mentioned as a core component of Majorcan cuisine in the provided text. While they might have desserts, the passage doesn't highlight them as central to their diet like the other options.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states: ""Tindzawo letinyenti eRotorua tinetindzawo lapho kudla kuphekwa khona ngematje lashisako"" which translates to ""Many places in Rotorua have places where food is cooked with hot springs.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage says the hot springs *are* used, but doesn't mention the fire used to heat them initially.
* **B:** While the passage mentions Wellington *might* have these places, it's not a definitive statement like it is for Rotorua.
* **C:** The passage states the practice was used historically (""kusihlwa lokosiwe"") but doesn't say it's common *now*.
"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungabalwanga njengendlela levamile yekushisisa umgodzi wehangi?,"The correct answer is **A: Igesi**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions these methods for heating the hangi pit:

*   **Ematje lashisako (hot stones):**  This is a primary method described.
*   **Kushisa kwemhlaba (geothermal heat):** The passage states the earth itself can heat the pit naturally.

The passage *does not* mention using gas (Igesi) as a traditional or common method for heating a hangi.  While gas might be used *now* in some modern adaptations, it's not part of the traditional methods described in the text.

Therefore, **A** is the only option not mentioned as a traditional way to heat a hangi."
Yini lengase iholele ekucashelweni lokukhetsekile kwe-monk nome i-nun?,"The correct answer is **A: Kugcoka libhali lelivalako** (Wearing a covering head).

Here's why:

The text specifically states that women are required to wear head coverings that cover their hair and shoulders.  It also mentions that if you have your own, especially a light-colored one, it's considered respectful. This directly relates to a monk or nun's covering.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kuvala emahlombe** (Covering the shoulders) - While covering the shoulders *is* part of the requirement, it's the head covering that is the most emphasized and distinct aspect of the dress code.
* **C: Kuboleka libhayi endlini yema-nun** (Borrowing a veil from the nuns' house) - The text mentions borrowing veils *at* the house if you don't have one, but it's not the reason for special attention.
* **D: Kugcoka siketi lesifika ngetulu kwemadvolo** (Wearing a skirt that reaches above the knees) - The text focuses on head and shoulder coverings, not skirt length.



"
Nguyiphi kuletimphahla letilandzelako lekunematfuba lamancane ekutsi ingatfolakala kuze ibolekwe endlini yema-nun? ,"The correct answer is **A: Tiketi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that women *need* to wear coverings (tiketi) that cover their arms and shoulders, and that many mosques provide them for women who don't have them. This implies tiketi are often borrowed. The passage also mentions that a borrowed tiketi might be damp and uncomfortable.

The other options are mentioned, but not as items commonly borrowed:

*   **Tikhindi:** Not mentioned as something borrowed.
*   **Emabhuluko:** Men are expected to *wear* their own long pants (emabhuluko).
*   **Emabhayi:** Not mentioned in the passage.

Kunini lapho sivakashi singaba nematfuba labanyenti ekubuka tinkhanyenti nasisavakashele tindzawo tase-Antarctic?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngetinyanga tasebusika**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Loku kuniketa litfuba lelihle lekubona i-Aurora, njengoba sibhakabhaka sitawube simnyama kakhulu. Njengoba tindzawo tinebantfu labambalwa, buningi bekukhanya abuvamisile kutsi bube inkhinga, ungakhona kujabulela kubuka tinkanyezi.""  This directly links the best time to see stars (and presumably Auroras) to the winter months when the sun doesn't rise (polar night) and the sky is very dark.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngetinyanga tasehlobo** - Summer months have more daylight, making it harder to see stars.
*   **B: Lapho lendzawo ite khona bantfu labanyenti** - More people mean more light pollution, making it *harder* to see stars.
*   **D: Nangabe lizinga lekungcoliswa kwekukhanya liphansi** - While low light pollution is good, the passage specifically ties the best viewing to the winter months. This is a condition that's generally met in the Antarctic during winter.



"
Kunini lapho lucingo lwesethelayithi lungeke lulunge khona kutsasa sikhundla samahlalekhikhini?,"The correct answer is **A: Nangabe umugcwa wesethelayithi wekubuka ungase uvimbeke** (If the satellite's view is obstructed).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that satellite phones require a clear line of sight to the satellite to function. Obstructions (like being inside a building or surrounded by dense foliage) will block that signal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nangabe lendzawo ichele kakhulu** (If the area is too cold) - The passage doesn't mention temperature affecting satellite phone functionality.
*   **C: Nangabe lutosetjentiswa ngephandle** (If it is used outdoors) - The passage states satellite phones *need* to be used outdoors in some cases for a clear signal.
*   **D: Nangabe luhambo lunetidzingo letitsite temadatha** (If the trip has small data requirements) - Data requirements are not discussed as a limitation in the passage.



"
Kunini lapho lucingo lwesethelayithi lungaba ncono khona kunamahlalekhikhini?,"The correct answer is **B: Eluhambeni lwesikebhe** (On a boat/ship).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that satellite phones are commonly used by those who transport things, *including* recreational vessels (ships). It explains the limitation of cell phones in kitchens (and by extension, places with obstructions) and how satellite phones overcome that by requiring a clear line of sight to the satellite.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nawusavakashelele edolobheni** (When visiting a city) - Cell service is generally good in cities, making satellite phones unnecessary.
* **C: Nangabe idatha ingadzingeki** (If data is not needed) - While satellite phones are primarily for voice, this isn't the main reason they're *better* than cell phones.
* **D: Nangabe kunematfuba lamanyenti ekutsi mahlalekhikhini utobamba** (If there's a high chance cell phones will get coverage) - This is the opposite of when a satellite phone would be preferable.

This translates to: ""Moldova has a population of diverse origins and has faced the problem of fighting over identity. In 1994, this disagreement led to the establishment of what is called the Transnistria Republic...""

Therefore, the disagreement over identity/ethnicity (buve) directly led to the creation of the Transnistria Republic.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako iTransnistria Republic lenako lokwehlukile kuyo yonkhe iMoldova?  ,"The correct answer is **C: Kucashelwa yi-UN (Recognized by the UN)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""lenahulumende wayo and nemali yayo kodvwa ayinakwa njengelilunga laMhlabuhlangene"" which translates to ""it has its own government and currency but is not recognized as a member of the United Nations"".  This means Transnistria Republic is *not* recognized by the UN, whereas Moldova is.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lulwimi (Language)** - The text says Moldova primarily uses Romanian, but Russian is more widely spoken. It doesn't say Transnistria uses a different language.
*   **B: Inkholo (Religion)** - The text states the predominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity. It doesn’t specify a different religion in Transnistria.
*   **D: Imali (Currency)** - The text states Transnistria *does* have its own currency, same as Moldova.

"Ngekwalesicephu, kunini lapho umuntfu kufanele avakashele khona iMontevideo nangabe afuna kubalekela umoya?","The correct answer is **A: Ngetinyanga tasebusika eNyakatfo Yemhlaba**.

Here's why:

The passage states that when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it's summer in Montevideo. The question asks when to visit to *escape* the cold. Therefore, visiting during the Northern Hemisphere's winter (which is Montevideo's summer) is the correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngesikhatsi komile eMontevideo:** The passage states there isn't a distinct dry season - rain is spread throughout the year.
* **C: Ngetinyanga tasehlobo eNyakatfo Yemhlaba:** This would be Montevideo's winter, which the passage describes as potentially very cold.
* **D: Ngetinyanga tasebusika taseMontevideo:** This is the opposite of escaping the cold – it *is* the cold season in Montevideo.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kunini lapho umuntfu kufanele avakashele khona iMontevideo nangabe atsandza simo selitulu lesipholile?","The correct answer is **D: Nakusebusika eNyakatfo Yemhlaba**.

Here's why:

The passage states that when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it's summer in Montevideo. The question asks when to visit for *cool* weather. Therefore, you'd want to go when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere to experience the cooler temperatures in Montevideo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nakusehlobo eMontevideo** - The passage says summer in Montevideo is *hot* (+30°C).
*   **B: Nakusehlobo eNyakatfo Yemhlaba** - This would be winter in Montevideo, so it would be hot, not cool.
*   **C: Nakusikhatsi setimvula eMontevideo** - The passage states there is no specific rainy season; rain happens throughout the year. It doesn’t imply a cool, wet season."
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungahlotjaniswa nemuntfu lowenta buciko begrafithi, ngalokuphambene nekucekelwa phansi kwemphahla?","The correct answer is **A: Imicimbi yegrafithi** (Graffiti events).

Here's why:

The passage specifically contrasts unwanted, destructive graffiti (vandalism) with *approved* graffiti artists, *graffiti events*, and ""legal walls."" This means graffiti events are associated with legitimate art, not vandalism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kuskribula** (Scribbling) - This sounds like random, uncontrolled marking, aligning more with the negative view of graffiti as damage.
* **C: Imidvwebo lengadzingeki endzaweni yesive** (Unwanted drawings in a public space) - This is a general description of *all* graffiti, including the destructive kind.
* **D: Emamaki langekho emtsetfweni** (Marks that are not legal) -  This directly implies illegality and vandalism, the opposite of legitimate art.

Ngusiphi sici semikhosi yemiculo letinye tihambeli letisitsatsa njengencenye lebalulekile?,"The correct answer is **C: Umculo lodlala kuze kube sebusuku**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ngisho nobe umculo endzaweni yawo ungaphela, kutaba netindzawo emcimbini letitochubeka tidlala umculo kute kube sebusuku."" This directly highlights that the continuation of music throughout the night is a feature that many attendees enjoy as part of the experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuletsa bantfwana labancane** - While some festivals *have* areas for families, the passage doesn't state this is a key feature attendees enjoy.
*   **B: Kukhempa kuleyo ndzawo** - Again, some festivals offer camping, but it's not presented as a widely appreciated feature.
*   **D: Kungena kusesenesikhatsi** - The passage advises entering early to get a good spot, but doesn't suggest this *is* a feature people enjoy.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Uma ufuna kuba dvute nalombukiso kufuneka usheshe ungene kutfola likamu lelidvute nalomculo."" This directly translates to ""If you want to be close to the show, you need to enter quickly to get a good spot with the music.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuya ebusuku** - While the music continues late, the passage emphasizes *getting in* early, not just staying until night.
*   **B: Kuhlala endzaweni yemindeni** - The passage mentions a family camping area, but doesn't say it's necessary to be there to be close to the music.
*   **C: Kukhempa ngaphandle kwendzawo** - The passage doesn't suggest camping outside the designated areas.

The passage states: ""Caphela: tindzawo tetjwala letincane lapha atisikahle kumuntfu losivakashi kutsi acitse sikhatsi khona."" This directly translates to ""Note: small bars here are not good for a visitor to spend time in.""  This refers to the small towns with drinking establishments.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuma-Pueblos:** The passage doesn't mention anything negative about Pueblos.
*   **C: Sikhungo setitolo:** The passage doesn't discuss shopping centers.
*   **D: Emakhasino:** The passage states casinos *do* offer entertainment, though mostly in Albuquerque and Santa Fe.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kukuphi lapho kunematfuba lamanyenti khona ekutsi sivakashi sitfole tekutijabulisa lokwatiwa kakhulu enyakatfo ye-New Mexico?","The correct answer is **C: Ekhasino lesedvute neSante Fe**.

Here's why:

The passage states that most casinos offer entertainment (especially the larger ones in Albuquerque and Santa Fe). It specifically mentions that you won't fully enjoy a night out without going to Albuquerque or Santa Fe. Therefore, a casino near Santa Fe would likely offer the most well-known entertainment options in the state.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ekhasino lechele ngema-awa lamabili kusuka e-Albuquerque:** While casinos near Albuquerque exist, the passage prioritizes Albuquerque *and* Santa Fe for entertainment.
*   **B: Ku-pueblo lechelile:** The passage doesn’t mention pueblos offering significant entertainment.
*   **D: Ebhaleni lelisedolobheni lelincane:** The passage warns about finding intoxicated drivers in smaller towns and doesn't suggest they are entertainment hubs.

Tivakashi letikhatsateka kakhulu ngemali tingase tifuna kugwema luphi luhlobo lwetinatfo?,"The correct answer is **A: Liwayini lase-Australia**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lamanti empompi endzawo aphephe kahle kuwasebentisa kunatsa, kodvwa emanti labilisiwe kumelula kuwatfola uma wesaba.""  This translates to ""Local fruit juices are safe to use when traveling, but bottled water is harder to find if you're scared.""

This implies that bottled water (which would include imported wines like those from Australia) might be difficult to obtain or less reliable for cautious travelers.  The passage doesn't suggest issues with local beer, local juices, or Belgian chocolate. Therefore, travelers concerned about spending money wisely (and potentially getting sick) would likely avoid the potentially problematic Australian wines.



"
"Ngalokusekelwe endzaweni lechazwe kulesicephu, nguliphi li-oda letinatfo lelingase lididwe ngumuntfu losevako?","The correct answer is **D: Likhofi i-flat white**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically mentions Australians prefer espresso and cappuccino (with cream) and *flat whites* with milk.** This directly indicates a flat white is a drink someone visiting the described location (Australia) could order.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Likhofi i-short black:** While Australians drink espresso, the passage doesn't *specifically* mention ordering a ""short black.""
* **B: Sinatfo lokutsiwa yi-Number One:** This refers to a beer, and the passage doesn't suggest it's a common order for a visitor.
* **C: I-Sauvignon Blanc yaseNew Zealand:** The passage mentions New Zealand wines are good, but doesn't imply it's a drink a visitor would *specifically* choose based on the context of local preferences.



"
"Njengobe satsatsa emakhulu lamatsatfu eminyaka, sikhatsi sekubusa kwemakoloni sacalwa nguliphi licembu?","The correct answer is **D: I-Spaniards**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ngelikhulu lesi-16 iParaguay...yaba khona ngenca yekuhlangana kwebancobi beseSpain nelicembu lalabo bemdzabu."" (In the 16th century Paraguay...came about due to the meeting of Spanish conquerors and the indigenous group.)  It then specifies the Spanish began entering the area in the 16th century, marking the start of colonial rule.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **I-Payaguá & I-Guaycurú:** These are indigenous groups who *preceded* Spanish colonization.
*   **I-Guaraní:** While important to the history of Paraguay, they were the indigenous people *encountered* by the Spanish, not the colonizers themselves.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu,nguyiphi indlela lencono yekwenta umuntfu waseParis kutsi akhululeke kuwe?","The correct answer is **C: Bani nenhlonipho**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""indlela lekahle kakhulu yekwati iParis kutsi utiphatse kahle, wente tintfo njengemuntfu lokutsiwa ngaye """"bien élevé"""" (ukhuliswe kahle)."" and ""Simo sangaphakatsi sabantfu baseParis siyancibilika nangabe ubabonisa inhlonipho.""  This directly translates to showing respect being key to getting along with Parisians.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yetama kulingisa indlela yekwenta tintfo yebantfu baseParis** - While adapting to local customs is helpful, the passage emphasizes *respect* as the primary approach.
*   **B: Veta kutetsemba** - Trust is important in any relationship, but isn’t the main point of the passage.
*   **D: Bonisa kukhululeka lokukhulu** - The passage implies Parisians value politeness and good manners, which aren’t necessarily the same as being overly casual.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kulolu lokulandzelako lokungatsatfwa njengembono longashintji mayelana nebantfu baseParis?","The correct answer is **A: Kutikhukhumeta (Being arrogant)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Parisians dislike arrogance and laughter *at* them (""ngekuticabangela bona, kungabi nanhlonipho nekuhaha""). It emphasizes the importance of politeness and good manners (""ukuthi utiphatse kahle, wente tintfo njengemuntfu lokutsiwa ngaye """"bien élevé"""""").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kuba luhlata (Being dirty)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about cleanliness.
* **C: Kutsandza kudlala (Liking to play)** -  The passage focuses on respectful behavior, not recreational preferences.
* **D: Kwenta tintfo ngalokungalindzelekile (Doing unexpected things)** - While Parisians might have their quirks, the passage centers around *how you behave towards them*, not their own unpredictable actions.



"
Iyini inzuzo yeLizinga Lekucala Etitimeleni taseCape Town?,"The correct answer is **A: Litilogo lingembili kwesitimela** (It's at the end of the train).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ema-MetroPlus ngaso sonkhe sikhatsi atfolakala ekugcineni kwesitimela dvutane naseCape Town."" This translates to ""MetroPlus is always found at the end of the train in Durban and Cape Town.""  This describes the *location* of First Class (MetroPlus) carriages, which is the benefit mentioned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kute bantfu labanyenti kakhulu** (There are many people) - The text says MetroPlus is *less crowded*, not more.
*   **C: Lishiphile kunelithikithi leLizinga Lesitsatfu** (It is cheaper than a Third Class ticket) - The text says it's *more expensive* than a Metro (Third Class) ticket.
*   **D: Liyimali lefanako neyelithikitsi leSitimela** (It costs the same as a train ticket) - The text says it costs *slightly more* than European metro tickets.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini sitimela sebagibeli eCape Town lesinayo?","The correct answer is **D: Kokubili ematilogo elizinga Lekucala neLesitsatfu** (Both First and Third class carriages).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states:

* **MetroPlus (First Class)**
* **Metro (Third Class)**

Therefore, Cape Town's MetroRail has both first and third-class carriages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Litilogo le-Metro lelingakagcwali kakhulu** - While MetroPlus is less crowded, this doesn't describe *all* the carriages.
* **B: Imali lefanako yemathikithi yawo womabili emazinga** - The passage says MetroPlus is *slightly* more expensive.
* **C: Kunemazinga lamatsatfu langafani** - The passage only mentions two classes (First/MetroPlus and Third/Metro).



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako tinambutane lokunematfuba lamancane ekutsi tikwente?,"The correct answer is **A: Kubangela kucubuka (Causing itching)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that unfamiliar animals can cause allergic reactions (""kulunywa""), and more seriously, ""kwandzise shevu"" which translates to causing rashes. Itching (kucubuka) is a common symptom of both allergies and rashes.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Kubangela ema-aleji (Causing allergies):** While the passage mentions allergies, the question asks what the animals *specifically* might *do*. Itching is a *result* of an allergy, not the action itself.
* **C: Kwandzisa ligciwane (Increasing germs):** The passage doesn’t mention anything about germs.
* **D: Kubangela kulimala lokunemandla (Causing severe injury):**  The passage mentions potential for *serious* illness or even death (""tibule bantfu""), but focuses more on the immediate reactions like itching and allergies.  Severe injury isn’t the primary or most common risk described.



"
Atsengwa kuphi emakhadi elucingo lakhokhelwa kusengaphambili?,"The correct answer is **A: Emaveni latsite (At gas stations)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...lamanye ngalokukhetsekile akuniketa emanani laphasi ekushaya nawushayela **emaveni latsite** kuphela."" ( ""...some are specifically offer lower rates when calling **gas stations** only.""). This directly links the purchase/use of these cards to gas stations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Etiteshini tetitimela (At train stations):** The passage doesn't mention train stations.
* **C: Etitolo letincane (At small shops):** While possible, the passage specifically highlights gas stations.
* **D: Etincingweni letikhokhelwako (At payphones):** The passage discusses using the cards *with* phones, not buying them *at* payphones.



"
Atfolakala kanjani emanani lancono ekushaya tincingo ngalamanye emakhadi ?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngetinombolo letishayela mahhala** (With toll-free numbers).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Letinsita tivamise kufinyeleleka ngekushayela inombolo lengabhadalelwa longayishayela ngetincingo letinyenti ngaphandle kwekubhadala.""  This directly translates to ""Savings are often available by dialing a toll-free number that many phones can dial without charge.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Angatfolakala kuphela emaveni latsite** (Only available in certain areas) - The passage doesn't limit savings to specific areas.
*   **C: Etitolo letincane** (Small titles) - This doesn't relate to phone call costs.
*   **D: Ngekusebentisa lucingo lolubhadalelwako futsi ukhokhe imali leyengetiwe** (Using a paid phone and paying extra) - This is the *opposite* of getting better rates.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngusiphi kuletihlahla letilandzelako lesingakavami e-Plitvice Lakes national park?","The correct answer is **B: I-oak**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states Plitvice Lakes has ""large beech forests, spruce forests, and fir trees."" It doesn't mention oak trees. Therefore, oak is the tree *not* commonly found there.
"
Ngutiphi kuletilwane letingakavami letitfolakalako e-Plitvice Lakes national park?,"The correct answer is **D: I-capercaillie**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage mentions:** ""tilwane letifaka ekhatsi libhele lelinsundvu laseYurophu, imphisi, lukhozi, sahhukulu, i-lynx, sahhanya netinyoni tiyatfolakala lapha, kanye naletinye tinhlobo tato"" - This includes many European animals, but specifically mentions birds.

*   **I-capercaillie** (also known as the wood grouse) is a large bird found in European forests, fitting the description of the park's wildlife.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **Ingalukhuni (Kudu):** Kudus are African antelopes, not typically found in European environments like Plitvice Lakes.
*   **Sambane (Eland):**  Elans are large African antelopes, also not found in Croatia.
*   **I-cassowary:** Cassowaries are native to Australia and New Guinea.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, emakhodi etifundza asita kuphi?","The correct answer is **B: Kulawula imakethe (Controlling the market)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Inhloso lekungiyo kunika tinkampani kulawula timaketse tato; konkhe kumayelana nekushintjana ngemali.""  This translates to: ""The purpose is to give companies control of the markets; it's all about exchanging money.""

The passage explicitly states the codes aren't effective at preventing illegal copying (""emakhodi alesigodzi akanawo umtselela ekukopeni ngalokungekho emtsetfweni""). They are instead a tool for companies to *control* the market and profit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kukopa emadiskhi (Copying disks):** The passage discusses preventing copying, not aiding it.
*   **C: Kuvikela bugebengu (Protecting piracy):** The passage is against piracy.
*   **D: Kuvikela kukopisha lokungekho emtsetfweni (Protecting against illegal copying):** The passage states the codes *don't* prevent illegal copying.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungemanga mayelana nemakhodi esifundza futsi lasakatwa tinkapani tetindzaba?","The correct answer is **B: Asita ekuvikeleni kukopisha lokungekho emtsetfweni.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""emakhodi alesigodzi akanawo umtselela ekukopeni ngalokungekho emtsetfweni"" which translates to ""the codes of the signature have no effect on preventing unauthorized copying.""  The passage argues that the codes *don't* prevent copying, and the whole system is about control and money, not actual protection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ayadzingeka kuze ulawule imakhethe lenkhulu** - The passage doesn't mention needing to control a large market. It focuses on the *illusion* of control.
*   **C: Alusito ekwakheni imali** - The passage directly states the system *is* about making money (""konkhe kumayelana nekushintjana ngemali"").
*   **D: Akavamisile kuvikela bugebengu** - The passage uses ""tivembela bugebengu"" ironically, suggesting the system *doesn't* protect against piracy, it just pretends to.



"
"Nawufika eveni lakini, nguyiphi inchubo ngalokuvamile lengakahleleki?","The correct answer is **A: Kuhlolwa kwalabangenako** (Checking of those entering).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...noma kwenta ngekuhleleka nawufika eveni lakini, kepha kulawula kwasemagedeni kusengaba ngumsebenti."" This translates to ""...even if things are organized when you arrive at the gate, but gate control is still a task.""  This strongly implies that *checking who is entering* (who the 'labangenako' are) is the part that isn't always smooth or well-organized.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Kubika tintfo** (Reporting things) - While reporting is important, the passage doesn't highlight it as a common issue.
* **C: Silinganiso lesisemtsetfweni setintfo** (Inventory assessment) - This isn't directly mentioned as a problem in the passage.
* **D: Kulawula kuphuma nekungena kwetintfo** (Controlling the exit and entry of things) - The passage focuses on the *control* being a task, but doesn't specifically say *what* part of that control is problematic - it's implied to be the people entering.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokufanele ukwati ngembi kwekufika eveni lakini?,"The correct answer is **B: Nawutawudzinga kutsi ubika tintfo letingetulu kwesilinganiso lesisemtsetfweni.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...bika konkhe ngalokusemtsetfweni"" - meaning you need to report everything according to procedure.  The phrase ""tintfo letingetulu kwesilinganiso lesisemtsetfweni"" (things above the standard procedure) directly relates to this reporting requirement.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Nakutawuba nendzawo yekuhlola labangenako:**  The passage doesn't mention inspection areas.
* **C: Nangabe kutawuba nalabalawula kuphuma nekungena kwetintfo:** While control of goods is mentioned (""kulawula kwasemagedeni""), the passage doesn't specifically say there *will* be controls on exits and entries.
* **D: Nangabe lokutsite lokuphetse kungakavumeleki:** The passage doesn’t mention restrictions on carrying items.

"Ngekwalesicephu, bunyenti bani lobenta kutsi bantfu labacancako bahlale batfola tindlela letinsha eSigodzingi SaseCochamó?","The correct answer is **C: Sicongo**. 

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nawusesicongweni sentsaba ubuka ubona buhle lobumangalisako."" (When you are at the top of the mountain you see amazing beauty.) This implies the *view* from the top – the scenic beauty – is what motivates climbers to find new routes.  ""Sicongo"" means view.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kubuka** - means to look, it doesn't explain *why* climbers seek new routes.
*   **B: Incenye lesetulu** - means the top part, it states where you are, not what inspires.
*   **D: Tindvonga** - means cliffs/walls. While they are part of the valley, they don't explain the motivation for finding new routes.

"Ngalokusekelwe ekwatisweni lokukulesicephu, ngubani lohlanganisa tindzawo letiwelwa kakhulu eNingizimu Yenkhaba Yemhlaba?","The correct answer is **B: I-Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""I-Star Alliance ihlanganisa konkhe ngaphandle kwemphumalanga Ningizimu Pacific kusukela eSantiago de Chile kuya eTahiti, lokuyindiza i-ATAM Oneworld."" This means Star Alliance covers the vast majority of South American and southern hemisphere destinations, except for a specific eastern South Pacific region covered by LATAM Oneworld.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I-SkyTeam** - The text explicitly states SkyTeam doesn't include *any* of these South American destinations.
*   **C: I-South Pacific** - This is a geographic region, not an alliance.
*   **D: I-LATAM Oneworld** -  This only covers a *portion* of the area (eastern South Pacific) and is described as being the exception to Star Alliance's broader coverage.



"
Ngutiphi tindiza letiwela kancane eNingizimu Yenkhaba Yemhlaba?,"The correct answer is **C: I-LATAM Oneworld**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""I-Star Alliance ihlanganisa konkhe ngaphandle kwemphumalanga Ningizimu Pacific kusukela eSantiago de Chile kuya eTahiti, lokuyindiza i-ATAM Oneworld."" This means LATAM (which is part of Oneworld) is the airline that operates flights to the areas *not* covered by Star Alliance in the South Pacific. Therefore, it flies to more destinations in that region.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I-Star Alliance:** The text says Star Alliance covers *most* of the Southern Hemisphere, but specifically *doesn't* cover the Eastern South Pacific.
*   **B: I-South Pacific:** This is a region, not an airline.
*   **D: I-SkyTeam:** The text states SkyTeam doesn't cover any Southern Hemisphere coastal areas.



"
Nguyiphi inhlangano yekuvakasha lephumelele i-Global Running Tours?,"The correct answer is **B: I-Go Running Tours**.

Here's why:

The text states that ""I-Go Running Tours letsetse sikhundla seGlobal Running Tours ihlanganisa labaniketa kugijima kwekubuka indzawo labaningi..."" This means I-Go Running Tours *formed* or *established* Global Running Tours by bringing together many tour operators. It wasn't a tour operator *joining* Global Running Tours, but rather the creator of it.

The other options are tour operators that *joined* Global Running Tours, not the organization that initiated it.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, i-Go Running Tours isita ekuhlanganiseni tinhlangano letingakhi tekugijima ube ubuka tindzawo?","The correct answer is **C: Idazini (Yes)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""I-Go Running Tours letsetse sikhundla seGlobal Running Tours ihlanganisa labaniketa kugijima kwekubuka indzawo labaningi kumakhontinenti lamane."" This directly translates to ""Go Running Tours established the position of Global Running Tours to *unite* many providers of running sightseeing tours across four continents.""

Therefore, Go Running Tours *does* help connect independent running sightseeing tour organizations.



"
Yini lokufanele sivakashi siyente nasinelitsemba lekubona kahle lihlosi?,"The correct answer is **C: Sebentisa tibonakudze** (Use binoculars).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Emabhubhesi tinhlosi kanye netingwe ngaletinye tikhatsi tiba nemahloni tibonakala kahle nawutibuka **ngetipopolo**.""  ""Tipopolo"" translates to binoculars. The passage specifically mentions that animals like buck, kudu, and leopards are best seen *with binoculars* because they are shy and hide in the bushes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tsatsa luhambo lwetinyawo** (Plan a walking safari): While walking safaris are mentioned, the passage doesn't say it's *specifically* for seeing shy animals.
*   **B: Hamba ehlatsini** (Walk in the forest): This is part of a safari, but doesn't guarantee seeing a kudu or leopard.
*   **D: Sebentisa imoti futsi usebentisa imishini leyetayelekile** (Use a car and tourist equipment):  The text says elephants and rhinos come *close to the cars*, but doesn't say this is the best way to see shy animals.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguluphi luhlobo lwesilwane sivakashi lokungenteka sisibone nasisahamba ngemoti?","The correct answer is **B: Tindlulamitsi**. 

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Letinye tilwane, letifaka ekhatsi tindlovu **netindlulamitsi**, titsandza kusondzela etimotweni futsi loko kungasibangela kutsi sitibone kahle."" (Some animals, including elephants and **giraffes**, like to approach vehicles and that can cause us to see them well.)

While the passage mentions lions, leopards, and rhinos, it specifically says giraffes are known to approach vehicles, making them the most likely animal to be seen while on a safari drive according to this text.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengehlisa imali yeluhambo?","The correct answer is **D: Kutfola licembu lebantfu labasitfupha nome ngetulu** (Finding a group of four or more people).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""zama kutfola labanye bantfu nente licembu lalabane kuya kulabasitfupha litoba ncono linani lelibhadalwa ngumuntfu amunye."" This directly translates to ""try to find other people and form a group of four to more, it will be better the amount paid by one person.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kutihambela wena** (Traveling alone) - The passage implies this would be *more* expensive, not less.
*   **B: Kutfola licembu lalabane** (Finding a group of four) - While good, the passage suggests even *more* than four is better.
*   **C: Kuhamba nalomunye umuntfu** (Traveling with one other person) - While better than alone, it doesn’t maximize the savings like a larger group.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngubani longaba nenhlanhla yekutfola imali yekuvakasha lencono?","The correct answer is **C: Bangani labahamba ndzawonye**.

Here's why:

The passage states that it's better to find others and form a group of four to six people to improve the cost per person. It also mentions that people sometimes trick others into paying more. This suggests that traveling *with friends* is the best way to get a good deal and avoid being overcharged.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tivakashi letikulungle kudvonsa timoti (Tourists who are willing to drive cars):**  While driving might be *a* way to travel, the passage focuses on splitting costs with others, not specifically on who drives.
* **B: Licembu lalabatsatfu (A group of three):** The passage suggests 4-6 is optimal, not necessarily just 3.
* **D: Licembu lalabasihlanu (A group of five):**  While 5 is within the range mentioned, the passage emphasizes finding *others* which implies a group formed through seeking companions, and it doesn't single out 5 as the magic number.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini leyafaka sandla ekutsi i-San Francisco icashelwe emhlabeni wonkhe?","The correct answer is **C: Kuhlukahluka kwetemnotfo** (The diversity of the economy).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""umnotfo wakhona wehlukahlukene. Tinhlobo tetemsebenti letinkhulu kunato tonkhe ngimisebenti yabochwepheshe, hulumende, tetemali, tekutsengiselana, netekuvakasha."" (Its economy is diverse. The major types of activities include professional, governmental, financial, commercial, and tourism jobs).  This diversity is directly linked to San Francisco's global recognition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuba khona njalo etinhlotjeni letehlukehlukene temaciko netindzaba** (Being constantly in different art and news scenes) - While the passage mentions culture (music, film, literature), it doesn't present this as *the* main reason for global fame.
* **B: Tikhungo temhlangano letisezingeni lelisetulu** (High-level conference facilities) - This is a *result* of San Francisco being well-known, not the primary cause.
* **D: Indzawo yekudla yase-Asia leta kahle** (Good Asian food scene) -  This is a benefit of the city but doesn't explain its overall global reputation.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako langasilo liciniso mayelana ne-San Francisco?","The correct answer is **D: Umnotfo usekelwe tekuvakasha ngalokuphelele** (The economy is based entirely on tourism).

Here's why:

The passage states that San Francisco's economy is *diverse* and includes major industries like **professional services, government, finance, trade, and tourism**. It doesn't say tourism is the *only* or *entire* basis of the economy.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Ifakwe kakhulu kumamuvi nasetincwadzini** (It's featured heavily in movies and books) - The passage explicitly states that ""the frequent exposure of music, movies, books, and popular culture helps in making the city famous worldwide.""
*   **B: Kunyenti kakhulu kudla kwase-Asia** (There is a lot of Asian food) - The passage mentions it's one of the leading cities for Asian communities like Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese.
*   **C: Manyenti emahhotela netindzawo temihlangano** (Many hotels and conference venues) - The passage says San Francisco is built with many things to assist visitors, including ""many hotels, restaurants, and high-quality meeting facilities.""

"Ngekwalesicephu, nguluphi luhlobo lwesivakashi lokute ematfuba ekutsi luzuze ngekusebentisa inkapani yekuvakasha?","The correct answer is **C: Sivakashi lesisengakayitfoli i-visa** (A traveler who hasn't yet obtained a visa).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that travel agents can help with obtaining travel documents *like visas*. This is a clear benefit for someone who hasn't secured their visa yet.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Sivakashi lesingakasenti sincumo** (A traveler who can't make decisions) - While agents can help with planning, the passage doesn't focus on indecisiveness as the primary reason to use one.
*   **B: Sivakashi lesitsambekele ekutentakaleleni kwetintfo** (A traveler who prefers things to be meticulous) -  The passage doesn't highlight detailed planning as the key benefit.
*   **D: Sivakashi lesinconota kubhuka nakunendali** (A traveler who hesitates to book even with money) - This isn't mentioned in the text.

Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungakashiwo kulesicephu njengenzuzo yekubhuka usebentisa inkapani yekuvakasha?,"The correct answer is **C: Emaphakheji lafaka konkhe**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions that travel agents can include things like breakfast, airport transfers, and flight/hotel arrangements – essentially, *packages* that cover multiple aspects of a trip. 

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Timphepha tekuhamba letisheshisiwe (Expedited travel documents):** While the passage *mentions* help with visas, it doesn’t highlight getting them faster as a primary benefit.
*   **B: Emadili lashisako (Hot deals):** The passage mentions discounts for agents themselves, but not necessarily for customers finding ""hot deals"".
*   **D: Kubamba indzawo (Booking space):** While agents do book things, the passage goes beyond just booking - it describes comprehensive planning.

"Ngekwalesicephu, yini tinhlelo tekuhumusha lokubhaliwe letingakhoni kuyenta?","The correct answer is **D: Kuhumusha kahle ngaso sonkhe sikhatsi** (To translate accurately all the time).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...kodvwa kuyadzinga kutsi kucashwe, ngoba kungenteka lokuhunyushiwe kungabi ngiko."" This translates to ""...but it requires checking, because it is possible that the translation is not correct.""  This directly implies that translation apps *cannot* always translate perfectly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuhumusha timphawu ngetilwini tekuhamba** (Translate signs while traveling) - The text *mentions* this as a capability of some apps.
* **B: Kuhumusha ticephu temibhalo** (Translate excerpts of texts) - The text says apps now commonly translate *small portions* well.
* **C: Kuhumusha emavi lasetintfweni usebentisa lucingo lwesimanje** (Translate images in magazines using a smartphone) - The text *mentions* this as a capability of some apps.



"
Yini levumela kutsi kuhunyushwe nawungekho ku-inthanethi?,"The correct answer is **C: Kudawuniloda kwatiswa kwelulimi** (Downloading language data).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...levumela kuhumusha ngaphandle kwe-intanethi **emva kwekutsi udawunilode lemininigwane yalolulimi**."" ( ...allows translation without the internet **after you download the language data**).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tinhlelo tekuhumusha letitfutfuke kakhulu** (Advanced translation programs) - While true, this doesn't *enable* offline translation, it just describes the type of program.
*   **B: Tincingo tesimanje** (Modern phones) - Phones are the device used, but not what enables the offline translation.
*   **D: Tinhlelo letitfolakala ngaphansi kwencenye yekuhumusha** (Programs found under the translation section) - This is too general and doesn't pinpoint the specific requirement for offline use.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungabangeli kuwa kwelichwa entsabeni?,"The correct answer is **A: Lichwa lelinamatsele** (The clinging snow).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Inkinga kutsi umkhitsiko uyanamatselana ngako udzinga kutsintfwa kuze wehle..."" (The problem is that the frost clings to it and needs to be melted to fall...). This directly identifies clinging snow as a *cause* of avalanches, or the falling of snow from the mountain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bantfu** (People) - The passage mentions people as a *factor* in avalanches, but not a direct *cause* of the snow falling. They can trigger them, but aren't the reason the snow is unstable.
* **C: Kuphuma kwelilanga** (Sunshine) - The passage mentions sunshine as *one* of the things that can cause the snow to fall, but it's not the primary, consistently present cause.
* **D: Kuwa lokwengetiwe kwelichwa** (Excessive snowfall) -  This is also mentioned as *a* cause, but not the fundamental one described as needing to be addressed (the clinging snow).



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokwenhla njengengelichwa leliwa entsabeni?","The correct answer is **B: Tindzawo letehlelako letite lichwa** (Places that collect dew).

Here's why:

The passage describes dew forming, clinging, and needing to be shaken off. It also mentions factors affecting its formation (sun, abundance of dew, natural events, people).  The core issue is the *location* where the dew accumulates – the places where it collects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lichwa lelinamatsele lelingabangelwanga** (Dew that sticks and isn't caused) -  The passage doesn't focus on the *cause* of the dew sticking, but rather the fact *that* it does.
* **C: Lichwa lelinyenti etindzaweni letehlelako** (A lot of dew in collecting places) - While the passage mentions abundance, it's not the central point. The collecting places *are* the point.
* **D: Lichwa lelisala lingatsintfwanga bantfu** (Dew that remains unshaken by people) -  The passage mentions people *shaking* it off, not dew remaining unshaken.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, khari usekelwe kutiphi titsako?","The correct answer is **B: Emakhambi netinongo**.

The text explicitly states: ""Khari kudla lokuhlanganisa emakhambi netinongo, kanye nenyama noma tibhidvo."" (Khari is a dish that combines grains and legumes, as well as meat or vegetables.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Iyogathi nemanti** - While yogurt and water can be used, they aren't the *base* ingredients.
*   **C: Lubisi lwekhokhonathi nenyama** - Coconut milk and meat are sometimes used, but not always.
*   **D: Tibhidvo nelubisi** - Vegetables and milk are optional additions.



"
"Kuletinye tifundza, lubisi lwekhokhonathi ngaletinye tikhatsi lusetjentiswa esikhundleni sasiphi sitsako kukhari?","The correct answer is **C: Iyogathi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Etifundzeni letisekhatsi nelive eNyakatfo yeNdiya nasePakistan, iyogathi ivame kusetjentiswa kukhari; ENingizimu yeNdiya nakuletinye tifundza letiselugwini lalelivekati, lubisi lwekhokhonathi livame kusetjentiswa.""  This translates to: ""In certain regions living in North India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry; In South India and some regions of the western regions, coconut milk is often used.""

Therefore, coconut milk is used *instead of* yogurt in those specific regions.
"
Kungani kudzingeka kutsi ujike utungelete tintsaba tase-Transantarctic kuze ufike etsafeni?,"The correct answer is **D: Kumelula kunekuhamba ngase-Ross Sea**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the traverse is 1600 km from McMurdo Station *to the Pole* and that it involves going *around* the Transantarctic Mountains.  This implies the mountains create a barrier, making a direct route via the Ross Sea more difficult than going around them. The passage specifically mentions needing to circle the mountains.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Siteshi i-McMurdo sivamise kuvalwa** - The text doesn't mention McMurdo Station being closed as a reason for the route.
*   **B: Lichwa lelingcingcekile liyingoti** - The text states the path is marked with flags, but doesn't say it's icy.
*   **C: Tigulumbha letikhetsekile atisheshi** - The passage mentions specialized vehicles, but doesn't suggest they are slow or the reason for the detour.



"
"E-South Pole Traverse, yini lephawulwe ngemafulegi?","The correct answer is **C: Timfa letigcwele lichwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lichwa laso lihlanganisa kuchekeka lokugcwaliswe ngemafulegi."" (Its route includes a track marked with flags).  This directly tells us that the track itself, which is part of the traverse, is marked with flags.  ""Timfa letigcwele lichwa"" translates to ""Tracks marked with flags"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Indlela esiteshini i-McMurdo** (The route to McMurdo Station) - The flags mark *the route of the traverse* from McMurdo, not just the route *to* McMurdo.
*   **B: Tigulumba letidvonsa emafutsa** (Islands that extract fuel) - The passage mentions fuel being *brought* but doesn't say islands extract it or are marked by flags.
*   **D: Emajika layingoti latungeleta tintsaba** (Latitude marks pointing to mountains) - The passage mentions the Transantarctic Mountains but doesn't say they are marked with latitude marks.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Imininingwane yekutfola i-visa kanye netindleko kuyashiyana emaveni ngemave futsi live losuka kilo lingaba nemtselela kuloku."" This directly translates to ""Visa information and costs vary between countries and each country can affect this.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage says a normal car *can* work with good planning, but a 4x4 is *recommended* because many places require it. This implies some places are *not* easily accessible by normal cars.
* **C:** The passage warns that South Africa being safe doesn't mean neighboring countries are. This contradicts the idea that all neighboring countries are safe.
* **D:** The passage *recommends* a 4x4, but doesn't say it's required for all travel, just for many areas.

"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengatsatfwa njengeseluleko lesibi etivakashini letifuna kuvakasha eNingizimu Afrikha ngemoti?","The correct answer is **A: Tintfo letitsite tetimo letiphutfumako emotini tingase tifunwe ngumtsetfo.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Live ngalinye linemtsetfo lohlukile lofuna kube netintfo letitsite emotweni tetimo letiphutfumako."" (Each border has different requirements that may require certain items in the car for emergency situations). This highlights that being prepared with emergency car equipment is crucial and could be a requirement at border crossings – a potential pitfall for tourists.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the passage does mention a standard car *can* work with good planning, it emphasizes the *benefit* of a 4x4. This isn't a negative piece of advice.
* **C:**  This is a positive aspect of road tripping in South Africa, not a warning.
* **D:** The passage says South Africa itself is safe, but neighboring countries aren't *all* the same. This is a cautionary note, but not a direct ""bad advice"" piece - it's about differing visa/cost implications.

Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungakashiwo kulesicephu njengengoti lengase ibe khona nawushiya tikhwama takho tingakagadvwa?,"The correct answer is **D: Tiphatsimandla tingase ticabange kutsi tinebhomu**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""...tikhwama letinganakwa tisematfubeni lamaningi ekwetjiwa, kani tingaphindze tidvonse emehlo alabaphetse kuletsa tinsolo tekusongelwa ngemabhomu.""  This translates to ""Bags left unattended are often searched, but they can also attract the attention of security who may suspect a bomb.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tingase tebiwe (They might be stolen):** While possible, the text focuses more on the security risk and legal consequences.
*   **B: Ungatfwala tidzakamiva kodvwa ungati (You might find drugs but not know):** The text mentions being framed with drugs, but it's presented as a *result* of leaving your bag unattended, not the primary risk.
*   **C: Tingase tiphambaniswe netalomunye umuntfu (They might be confused with another person):** This isn't mentioned in the text at all.



"
Yini lengashiwongo kulesicephu ngekutfwala tidzakamiva?,"The correct answer is **C: Tinja letinukisa tidzakamiva tingase tisetjentiswe ngaphandle kwekutsi nitjelwe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""njengoba tinja letimfumfutsa tidzakamiva tingasetjentiswa noma nini ningakatjelwa"" which translates to ""as dogs that sniff drugs may be used at any time without you being notified.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the passage mentions first-time offenders receiving harsh penalties, it doesn't specifically say they are *sentenced to jail*. It says penalties *can include* over 10 years in prison or death.
*   **B:** The passage implies caution when traveling to other countries, but doesn't explicitly state you *should* be extra careful. It focuses on the consequences of carrying drugs.
*   **D:** The passage warns about searches, but it's because you might be carrying drugs, not just a general fear of authorities searching your belongings.



"
Nguyiphi inhlobo yesinatfo lengakashiwo njengentfo longetama kuyenta ekhaya ngesikhatsi uhleli?,"The correct answer is **A: Ijusi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Uma utiva ukhutsele nakakhulu, tsatsa lelitfuba kwenta ijusi noma kuhlanganisa emasmoothies."" (If you feel very bored, take the opportunity to make juice or blend smoothies.) This directly suggests juice as something to make at home when you're feeling restless.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Likhofi (Coffee)** - The text mentions coffee being enjoyed *in the morning* but doesn't suggest making it when bored.
*   **C: Bhiya (Beer)** - The text doesn't mention beer at all.
*   **D: Litiya (Tea)** - The text mentions tea being drunk *at night* but doesn't suggest making it when bored.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Uma uhlala edolobhenikati lelinemikhuba yekunatsa lehlukahlukene, yani emabhareni noma etinkantini etindzaweni letidvute longakavami kuya kito kakhulu."" (If you live in a city with diverse culinary customs, like bars or cafes in less frequented areas.)

This directly points to exploring places with unique and less common drinks as a way to experience the city's culinary culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Titolo telikhofi ngephandle kwendzawo lokuyo** (Coffee shops outside the area) - While coffee is mentioned, the passage focuses on *different* culinary experiences, not just coffee.
*   **B: Titolo tejusi nome smoothie** (Juice or smoothie places) - The passage suggests making juice/smoothies *at home* when feeling stressed, not seeking them out as a cultural experience.
*   **D: Titolo tekudlela letenta litiya i-chamomile** (Restaurants that make chamomile tea) - Chamomile tea is a soothing remedy, but isn't related to exploring a city's unique culinary scene.



"
Itfolakala kuphi imifanekiso yematuba lebatiwe?,"The correct answer is **B: Ebaleni elisontfo**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Lesontfweni kulamathuna lalabaleni kubekwe ematuba lamahle lakhiwe nge mabula."" This translates to ""In the beautiful valley, there are dunes where beautiful stone structures are built.""  This directly links the stone structures (the ""ematuba lebatiwe"" - carved structures) to the ""baleni elisontfo"" (beautiful valley).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Li-awa nehhafu kusuka emakhaya** - This refers to the time spent admiring the place, not where the structures are located.
* **C: Esichingini sase-Eysturoy** - While the valley is *next* to the Eysturoy cliff, the structures are in the valley itself.
* **D: Ngekhatsi esontfweni** - This refers to *when* the structures are visible (during the week), not *where* they are.

Nguluphi luhlobo lwe-visa lolungase ludzinge kutsi umuntfu aletse bufakazi bekuba nemali leyenele yekumsekela?,"The correct answer is **D: I-visa yekufundza (Student visa)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Kuze utfole ivisa nawungumfundzi lenchubo netintfo lokudzingeka ube nato tihlukile kunanawufuna ivisa yekuvakasha noma yekuyokwenta ibhizinisi...utawudzinga kutsi ube nebufakazi bekutsi utawukhona kutisekela lokungenani kulomnyaka wekucala wetifundvo takho."" This directly translates to needing proof of funds to support yourself for at least the first year of studies when applying for a student visa.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I-visa yebhizinisi (Business visa):** While a business visa might require demonstrating financial stability, the passage doesn't specifically link it to needing proof of funding for a *duration* like a year.
*   **B: I-visa yekuvakasha (Tourist visa):** Tourist visas generally don't require extensive proof of long-term financial support.
*   **C: I-visa yesikhashana (Short-term visa):**  The passage indicates short-term visas (for tourism or business) have different requirements than student visas.



"
Ngubani lokunematfuba lamanyenti ekutsi adzinge i-visa lenesikhatsi leseluliwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Umfundzi lovela kulelinye live** (A student from another country).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kuze utfole ivisa nawungumfundzi lenchubo netintfo lokudzingeka ube nato tihlukile kunanawufuna ivisa yekuvakasha noma yekuyokwenta ibhizinisi."" (To get a visa as a student, the requirements are different than for a tourist or business visa). It also says that students generally need to prove they'll be staying for at least the first year of their studies and have an acceptance letter from the school. This implies a longer-term visa is required for students.

The passage highlights that students are more likely to need a visa that lasts for a significant period, unlike short-term tourists or business travelers.



"
Kunini lapho kufanele ube nendzaba khona netimbuzulwane?,"The correct answer is **C: Etindzaweni temahlatsi lanemvula** (In rainy forest areas).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states you need to watch out for ticks when climbing mountains and walking in rainy forests (""ngalokuvamile, utawudzinga kugadza timbhuzulwane nangabe uncuma kucanca intsaba uhamba ngasemahlatsini emvula"").  It also mentions they can get in your car even with a short opening while driving through rainy forests.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngetinyanga tasehlobo** (During summer months) - While ticks *are* more active in warmer months, the passage focuses on the *location* (rainy forests) rather than the season.
*   **B: Nawuhayikha** (When hiking) - Hiking is mentioned, but only *in the context of being in rainy forests*.
*   **D: Nawusashayela** (When driving) - Driving is mentioned as a way you *encounter* ticks, but the risk comes from driving *through* rainy forests, not just driving in general.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lokufanele ungayenti kuze ugweme timbuzulwane nawushayela etindzaweni temahlatsi lanemvula?","The correct answer is **A: Kushiya tivalo temoti tivulekile sikhatsi lesidze (Leaving the car windows open for a long time)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that even opening the car windows for a *few* minutes is enough for flies to get in. Leaving them open for a *long time* would obviously increase the risk.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kushayela ehlobo (Driving in summer)** - The passage specifically mentions driving in the rainy season, not summer.
* **C: Kushayela etindzaweni letishisako (Driving in hot places)** - The passage focuses on rainy forests, not hot places.
* **D: Kushiya imoti inganamuntfu nawusahayikha (Leaving the car unattended while parking)** - This doesn't relate to preventing flies from entering.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako langesilo liciniso mayelana ne-Sundarbans?","The correct answer is **C: Yindzawo lenkhulu emhlabeni yemahlatsi e-mangrove**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states: ""I-Sundarbans indzawo lenkhulu emhlabeni lenesitjalo i-mangrove lesiselusebeni lwelwandle emhlabeni…"" (Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Inalamanye emahlatsi lamakhulu lambalwa lasekasele:** The text doesn't mention hundreds of other forests.
*   **B: Incenye yendzawo yayo igcwele emachaphoti:** The text states that a quarter of the area is covered in water/mudflats, but doesn't say it's *full* of mudflats.
*   **D: Ilikhaya letinyamatane letinemabalabala kwendlula ema-Bengal tiger:** The text states there are approximately 400 tigers and 30,000 deer, meaning there are far more deer than tigers."
Nguyiphi incenye yelihlatsi lesekhatsi kwendzawo yaseNdiya?,"The correct answer is **A: I-Sundarbans National Park**.

The passage states: ""Incenye yelihlatsi lelisemhlabeni waseNdiya ibitwa ngekutsi yiPaki Yesive yaseSundarbans."" (A portion of this forest area in India is called Sundarbans National Park).



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngubani lokunematfuba lamakhulu ekutsi alucondze lokungenani kancane lulwimi lwesiNgisi?","The correct answer is **B: Bantfu labancane ngeminyaka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kulamanye ungalindzela lwati lelingakapheleli - ikakhuluati kubantfu labasha."" This directly translates to ""...you can expect incomplete knowledge - especially among young people.""  This indicates that younger people are more likely to have less-than-perfect English skills.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bantfu labakhuluma lokungenani letinye tilwimi letimbili:** While multilingualism exists, the passage doesn't suggest it relates to English proficiency issues.
* **C: Bantfu labaya eToronto:**  Toronto is a location where diverse languages are spoken, but simply *going* there doesn't mean someone will have limited English.
* **D: Bantfu lasebakhulile ngeminyaka:** The passage implies the opposite - older individuals may have more difficulty *pronouncing* English words, but not necessarily a lack of overall knowledge.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lokungaba matima kuyibita?","The correct answer is **B: Emakheli**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Liciniso laloku siyalibona emakhelini, ngalokuvamile lokulukhuni kuphimisela kahle emagama awo."" This directly translates to ""This is true with addresses, it is often difficult to pronounce their names correctly.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Emagama lanetimphawu letehlukile (Words with different symbols):** While potentially difficult, the passage doesn't specifically mention this.
*   **C: Emagama labhaliwe (Written words):** The passage actually says written words are *easier* to understand than spoken words.
*   **D: Sitsotsi sendzawo (Local slang):** The passage doesn't mention slang at all.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngusiphi simo lesingalungela sivakashi lesihlela kutsatsa ibhasi lesuka esiteshini lesisekhatsi nesifundza?","The correct answer is **A: Lesivakashi siya e-Jakar futsi sesivele silitsengile lithikithi** (The visitor is going to Jakar and has already bought a ticket).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""emabhasi laya empumalanga neJakar/Bumthang asuka nga-06:30 nanga-07:30"" (buses to the east and Jakar/Bumthang depart at 6:30 and 7:30).
* **The text *also* recommends:** ""kutsi lithikithi ulitsenge kusasele emalanga lingakafiki lilanga lakho lekuhamba"" (that you buy your ticket several days before your travel day).

Therefore, someone going to Jakar who has *already* purchased a ticket fits the advice given in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While Bumthang is mentioned, the text doesn't specify a need to leave at 7.
* **C:** The text mentions Paro as a destination accessible by taxi, not bus, and doesn't mention a departure time of 11.
* **D:**  The text says buses *depart* at 6:30/7:30, not *arrive* by 6:20.  Arriving before departure makes no sense.

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Njengoba emabhasi lachumanisa tifundza avamise kugcwala kuyaye kube kahle kutsi lithikithi ulitsenge kusasele emalanga lingakafiki lilanga lakho lekuhamba."" (As buses fill up quickly, it is best to buy your ticket a few days before your travel date.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Emabhasi asuka ngemuva kwa-8:30 (Buses depart after 8:30)** - The passage states buses leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
* **C: Emabhasi lamanyenti ahlale esuka lilanga lonkhe (Many buses run all day long)** - The passage says they run all day, *but* emphasizes they get full.
* **D: Itekisi lehlanganyelwako ingase ibe yindlela lehlakaniphile yekuhamba (A shared taxi may be a smart way to travel)** - While mentioned as an option, it's presented *after* discussing the buses, and doesn’t have the same emphasis.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungayichazi kahle i-Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ayifinyeleleki ngendiza**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...futsi linesikhungo setindiza"" which translates to ""...and has an airport."" This directly contradicts option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Inelitfonya lelikhulu lema-Arab kunayo yonkhe lenye incenye yelive** - The passage states it has ""an Arab spirit that surpasses an African one,"" supporting this option.
*   **B: Kugcwele buphuya** - While the passage mentions it was once a remote place, it now describes it as a place people *want* to visit, indicating it’s not full of danger.
*   **D: Iyachubeka idvonsa tivakashi letinelilukuluku** - The passage states it's ""a city that attracts visitors"" and has an airport, supporting this option.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokuliciniso nge-Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **A: Lelidolobha liyafinyeleleka ngendiza**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states: ""futsi linesikhungo setindiza"" which translates to ""and has an airport"". This means Timbuktu is accessible by plane.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Yinhle kakhulu kunekutsi ibe nguleliphuyile:** The passage states it's a ""dolobha leliphuyile"" (destroyed city), but then says its history *makes* it attractive to tourists, not that it's currently beautiful.
*   **C: Yincane imihlobiso yase-Afrikha kunakulamanye emadolobha lakhelene nayo:** The passage says it has a unique ""moya wesi-Arab"" (Arab spirit) *instead* of African, implying it's distinct, not lacking in African influence.
*   **D: Lelidolobha alisatikhangi tivakashi:** The passage explicitly says ""lidvumela lalo lilenta libe lidolobha lelitsandza kuvakashelwa tivakashi"" (its history makes it a city loved by tourists).

Ekucaleni bekuhlelwe kutsi atoba khona nini ema-Olimpiki asehlobo? ,"The correct answer is **D: Nga-July 2020**.

The text states: ""Uma ngabe ubhadalele indiza nendzawo yekulala kwa-2020 ngaphambi kwekutsi lokuhlehlisa kumunyetelwe... lapho khona kuhlelwe umdlalo wema-Olempikhi."" This indicates the games were originally scheduled for 2020.  While they *took place* in August/September 2021, that was a postponement.

"Ngekwalesicephu, kunini lapho lifu lelimise kwefanla liba khona yinkanyamba?","The correct answer is **A: Lapho umoya ufika kumamayela langu-100 ngeli-awa** (When the wind reaches 100 miles per hour).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Tenta umoya lomkhulu (ngalokuvamile lohamba 100-200 wemamayela/ngeli-awa) longaphakamisa tintfo letisindzako utiyise emoyeni..."" (Describe the large wind (usually traveling 100-200 miles/hour) that lifts heavy things and carries them into the air...).  This directly links the strong wind speed to the formation of a tornado.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lapho emakholumu emoya acala kutungeleta** (When air columns begin to rotate) - While rotation is *part* of a tornado, the passage emphasizes the *speed* of the wind as a key factor.
* **C: Nayisashintja ekubni ngemafu lanesiphepho** (It is still changing in the form of a wind) -  This is too vague and doesn't pinpoint the critical moment.
* **D: Ngemuva kwekufika emhlabatsini** (After arriving on Earth) - The passage describes the tornado *becoming* a ""strong wind"" *when it reaches the ground*, not forming *after* reaching the ground.

*   **The passage explicitly states:** ""Tenta umoya lomkhulu (ngalokuvamile lohamba 100-200 wemamayela/ngeli-awa)..."" (Describes a large wind, often traveling 100-200 miles per hour...). This is a core characteristic of a tornado described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ngalokuvamile ihamba netintfo letisindzako** (It usually travels with heavy objects): While tornadoes *can* lift heavy objects, it's a *result* of the tornado, not a defining characteristic *of* it.
*   **C: Iba ngemafu lamise kwefanela ngemuva kwekufika emhlabatsini** (It becomes a funnel that fits after arriving on Earth): The passage describes the tornado *starting* as a rotating column of air, not *becoming* a funnel.
*   **D: Ngemakholumu lajikeletako lafushela umoya ngaphandle** (With rotating columns pushing air outwards): The passage describes the tornado *drawing* air upwards and swirling it, not pushing air outwards.

"Ngekwalesicephu, sivakashi kufanele sisitfole kutsi seluleko mayelana nesimo setepolitiki edolobheni lesiya kulo?","The correct answer is **A: Kuhulumende walelive lesitolivakashela (From the government of the country you are visiting)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ungase wetame kuphindze uchumane nahulumende kuze utfole sicondziso ngaphandle kwaleso losicabangako wena, kodvwa teluleko takhe tentelwe bantfu bakulelo live."" (You may also want to consult with the government to get advice outside of what you're thinking, but their advice is tailored to people in that country.) and ""Beluleki bamane nje basifinyeto sesimo setepolitiki eveni lelitsite."" (Advisors simply provide a summary of the political situation in that location.)

This directly indicates that the government of the country you are visiting is the source for political situation information.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Emibonweni levetwe etelulekweni tetekuhamba (Opinions stated in travel advice)** - The passage says these opinions are often inadequate and simplistic.
*   **C: Kutakamuti takulelive lesitolivakashela (From the customs of the country you are visiting)** - The passage doesn't mention customs as a source of political information.
*   **D: Kuhulumende wakubo (From your own government)** - While your government might offer *some* advice, the passage emphasizes the importance of getting information tailored *to that country* from *its* government."
"Nakuneteluleko tetekuhamba, yini umuntfu wekuhamba lokunematfuba lamancane ekutsi ayitfole?","The correct answer is **C: Kutsintseka kwemshuwalensi wemphilo** (Expiration of health insurance).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Nangabe lelive lotobe ulivakashele libhekana nekwelulekwa kwetivakashi, umshwalensi wakho wetemphilo eluvakashweni nobe umshwalensi wekumisa luvakasho lwakho ungatsintseka."" This directly translates to ""If the country you are visiting faces travel advisories, your health insurance on the trip or travel cancellation insurance may expire.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umshuwalensi lomisiwe** (Invalid insurance) - While insurance *could* become invalid, the passage specifically mentions *expiration* as a risk.
*   **B: Tingcikitsi letentiwe taba melula mayelana nesimo setepolitiki talelive** (Simplistic advice regarding the political situation of the country) - The passage notes advice is often too simplistic, but doesn't say a traveler is likely to *receive* it.
*   **D: Kwatiswa lokunemininingwane leminyenti mayelana nesimo setepolitiki talelive** (Being provided with extensive information regarding the political situation of the country) - The passage indicates advice is often *lacking* in detail, not that extensive information is provided.

"Ngekwalesicephu, nguluphi luhlobo lweluhamba lokunematfuba lamancane ekutsi ludzinge kutsi utfole lusito lwekubhuka enkapanini yekuhamba?","The correct answer is **D: Luhambo lwekucala lwesivakashi loluya kulamanye emave**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a travel agent is most helpful for travelers who are unfamiliar with a destination, its culture, language, or budget.  A first-time traveler going to a foreign country *definitely* fits this description. They are likely to need help with planning, understanding local customs, and potentially with language barriers.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A:** A business trip to a familiar city doesn't usually require a travel agent.
*   **B:** A two-week trip with a fixed budget might *benefit* from an agent, but it's not as urgently needed as a first-time international trip.
*   **C:** Language barriers are mentioned as a reason to use an agent, but the *first-time* aspect of traveling to a foreign place generally necessitates more comprehensive assistance.

"Ngekwalesicephu, kukusiphi simo lapho khona sivakashi sitawuzuza khona kakhulu elusitweni lwenkapani yetekuhamba?","The correct answer is **B: Nangabe lesivakashi sinenshisekelo yekubhuka luhambo lolukhetsekile kwekucala** (If the traveler is interested in booking a specialized trip for the first time).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that travel agencies excel at providing *specific* knowledge about destinations – culture, language, cost of living, etc. This is particularly valuable for travelers embarking on a unique or less common type of trip.  The passage states they are good at ""khetsa eluvakashweni lelendlula lwati lwesivakashi mayelana nemvelo, emasiko, lulwimi noma live lelinemali lephansi"" (choosing a vacation that exceeds the traveler's knowledge about nature, customs, language or a low-cost life).

Let's look at why the other options are less fitting:

*   **A:** Booking flights is a standard service, not where a travel agency's specialized knowledge would be most beneficial.
*   **C:** Knowing the local language is helpful *to the traveler*, but doesn't necessarily require the agency's expertise.
*   **D:** Visiting a place with different cultures is interesting, but again, doesn't necessarily demand the unique assistance a travel agent provides.

"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengase isite sivakashi sigweme kudvumateka nasivakashele tindzawo letinsha?","The correct answer is **A: Kulindzela lizinga lelifanako nalapho sisuka khona** (Expecting the same standards as where you come from).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Nawuvakashile gadza kutsi timo tingafani njengobe tinjalo """"emuva ekhaya""""."" (When you visit, remember that things will be different than """"back home""""). It goes on to list numerous examples of differences (customs, food, transport, etc.).  

The passage emphasizes *avoiding* disappointment by *not* expecting things to be the same.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kukulungela kwetama kudla lesingakakwetayeli** (Being prepared to try unfamiliar food) - While being open to new food is good, the passage doesn't say this prevents disappointment, it just says food *will* be different.
* **C: Kulandzela imitsetfo lefanako neyalapho sisuka khona** (Following the same customs as where you come from) - The passage actually says the opposite - customs *will* be different.
* **D: Kugwema kwenta lucwaningo ngetindzawo tekulala** (Avoiding research about accommodation) - The passage doesn't mention accommodation or research.

"Ngalokusekelwe ekwatisweni lokukulesicephu, luhlobo lolunjani lwemuntfu lolungase ludvumateke naluvakashela endzaweni yangaphandle?","The correct answer is **C: Umuntfu lonemcondvo lovalekile** (A person with a closed mind).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that things will be *different* than ""back home"" – customs, food, transportation, language, etc.  It warns against getting upset or disliking how things are done in the new place. This directly implies that someone who is inflexible in their thinking (""nemcondvo lovalekile"" - closed-minded) will be the one most likely to be frustrated and unhappy with the differences they encounter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umuntfu lotsandza kudla lokungakajwayeleki** (A person who likes unfamiliar food): This person would likely *enjoy* the differences, not be upset by them.
* **B: Umuntfu lojabulela lushintjo** (A person who enjoys change): This person would also likely adapt well.
* **D: Umuntfu lotsandza kufundza** (A person who likes to learn):  Learning about new cultures is positive and wouldn't necessarily lead to frustration.

Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungasiso seluleko lesinconywako kubantfu labavakashela live lelisatfutfuka kwekucala?,"The correct answer is **C: Kunconywa umbhedze nome ihamokhi nangabe ukhempe ngaphandle** (It is recommended to have a bed or hammock if you are camping outside).

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states: ""Nangabe nitolala ngephandle emathendeni, wota nembhedze wangaphandle noma ihamoki kubalekela tinyoka, tinyoka tebafati nalokunye lokufanako."" (If you are camping outside, bring an outdoor bed or hammock to protect against snakes, scorpions, and the like.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yati tilwane tasendzaweni ngembi kwekutsi ulale phansi** (Fear local animals more than sleeping on the ground) - While avoiding sleeping on the ground is advised *because* of animals, the passage doesn't say to *fear* them more than the ground itself.
*   **B: Gwema kudla kakhulu ngemalanga akho ekucala** (Avoid eating too much during your first few days) - The passage suggests spending *more* money on things like food and services, not avoiding it.
*   **D: Tfola lihhotela lelisezingeni lelisetulu nawufika kwekucala** (Find a high-quality hotel when you first arrive) - While the passage mentions using Western-style hotels, it doesn't specifically recommend finding a *high-quality* one; it's more about a familiar comfort.

Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungakabalwa njengentfo longayijabulela nawusetayelana nelive lelisatfutfuka?,"The correct answer is **C: Matalasi nome sipontji sekukhempa**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically warns against sleeping on the ground (""esiphonjini"") or in cheap places where animals could get to you. It then suggests using an outdoor bed or hammock to avoid snakes and other creatures *when camping*.  This implies that a mattress or camping cot is a good idea for outdoor sleeping, therefore something you *would* enjoy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kudla kwasenshonalanga (Western-style food):** The passage *recommends* spending more money on Western-style food.
*   **B: Emasevisi lasezingeni lelisetulu (High-level services):** The passage implies enjoying higher-level services.
*   **D: Emahhotela lasezingeni lelisetulu (High-level hotels):** The passage *recommends* spending more money on high-level hotels.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Uma uvakashile unangcondvomshini lephatfwako noma ithebulethi, gcina ikhophi kumemori yayo noma kudiskhi (letfolakalako ngaphandle kwe-inthanethi).""  This directly addresses the situation of someone needing a copy *without* internet access.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuniketa umuntfu lahamba naye ikhophi** - While helpful, the passage doesn't prioritize this as the *best* option for someone who can't access the internet themselves.
* **B: Kutitfumelela ikhophi nge-imeyili** - This requires internet access, which the person doesn't have.
* **D: Kugcina ikhophi ku-“cloud”** - This *also* requires internet access.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungadzingeki kukhonjiswe kupholisi?","The correct answer is **A: Tinombolo telucingo temave emhlaba tekwenta ticelo**.

Here's why:

The passage states you might need to provide ""inombolo telucingo takulamanye emave kuze bagunyatwe futsi bafake sicelo sekutfola lokutsite"" (phone numbers of other people to authorize and file a claim). It *doesn't* specify needing phone numbers for simply *making* a claim request.

Let's look at why the other options are needed:

* **B: Likheli le-imeyili lenkapani yemshuwalensi (Email address of the insurance company):** The passage mentions needing the email address of the insurer.
* **C: Tinombolo telucingo temave emhlaba tekugunyata (Phone numbers of other people for authorization):**  This is directly requested in the text.
* **D: Likheli le-imeyili lemnikati wepholisi (Email address of the policy holder):** The passage states the insurer might need the policy holder’s email address.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguyiphi isayizi leveta ifomathi yelifilimu lesetjentiswa kakhulu?","The correct answer is **C: I-35 mm negative**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kusukela kulavamile langu-35 mm (36 nanga-24)."" This translates to ""Starting with the common 35 mm (36 by 24).""  This indicates that 35mm was the most frequently used format.

While the passage *also* discusses the 6x6 format, it presents it as *another* option, and highlights how much *larger* it is compared to 35mm.  It doesn't say 6x6 was more commonly used.

Therefore, 35mm is the most common format described in the text."
Nguyiphi kulamafomathi elifilimu lalandzelako leniketa kukhanya lokufana nekwe-DSLR?,"The correct answer is **A: Lifilimu lelingu-35 mm**.

Here's why:

The passage states that 35mm film (36x24mm) is commonly used and *can be replicated with modern DSLR sensors*.  The other formats (medium format and 6x6) are significantly *larger* than a typical DSLR sensor, offering much more detail and a different look – they don't replicate the DSLR experience.

Therefore, 35mm is the film format most closely aligned with the image size and capabilities of a DSLR.

Here's why:

* The text states that after practicing formatting and editing, you can *then* build your own website. This implies website creation is the culmination of the initial steps.
* Options A, B, and D are all skills you *develop* to *enable* you to run the business, but they aren't the business itself.  You need a platform (the website) to *showcase* those skills and attract clients.



Therefore, **C** is the correct answer."
"Nawucalisa ibhizinisi yakho yekubhala ngetekuhamba, ngumaphi kulamakhono lalandzelako lokungase kudzingeke uwatfutfukise kucala?","The most logical answer, based on the prompt, is **A: Kubhala iwebusayithi (Website Writing)**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt focuses on writing for an *existing* travel blog.** It suggests building your skills *within* that context first.  Writing for a website is the core skill needed for that.
* While the prompt *mentions* eventually building your own website (D), it states that's something you do *after* gaining experience.
* Editing (B & C) are important skills, but they build on the foundation of *being able to write* in the first place. You need content to edit!

Therefore, starting with website writing is the first step to tackling this travel writing job.

Kukuluphi luhlobo lwesimo selitulu lapho tinkinga tematfumbu tivame kutfolakala khona?,"The correct answer is **C: Lapho kushisa khona** (Where it is hot).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Futsi etindzaweni letishisako ligciwane landza ngekushesha futsi liphile sikhatsi lesidze nalingephandle kwemtimba. Kanjalo lokuhlupheka kweDelhi Belly, kucalekiswa kwaFaro, Kutiphindzisela kwaMontezuma, nebangani babo labanyenti... tinkhinga tesisu tetayelekile etindzaweni letishisako...""

Also the suffering of Delhi Belly, Pharaoh's curse, Montezuma's revenge, and their many friends... stomach problems are common in hot places...""



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kuchayeka njalo kungabangela kuvikeleka kuphi?","The correct answer is **A: Etinkingeni tematfumbu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ekhaya, ngenca yekuchayeka njalo emagciwaneni asendzaweni, manengi ematfuba ekutsi ugcine umtimba wakho sewukhona kulwa nawo."" This translates to: ""At home, due to constant exposure to germs in the environment, there are many opportunities for your body to remain able to fight them off.""  This directly links constant exposure to building immunity/being protected *in the gut* (umtimba - often refers to the gut/internal system in this context).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kumagciwane endzawo (To local germs):** The passage discusses building *resistance* to germs, not just being exposed to them.
*   **C: Etinkingeni tekuphefumula (Breathing problems):** The passage compares gut problems to breathing problems, but focuses on the gut.
*   **D: Etinkingeni tesisu (Stomach problems):** The passage *describes* stomach problems that can be contracted while traveling, but doesn't say constant exposure *prevents* them – it’s the ongoing exposure at home that builds immunity.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokubuhle bekuvakasha endzaweni ye-Schengen?,"The correct answer is **A: Kugwema ticelo letinyenti tema-visa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that having a Schengen visa means you ""awudzingi kufaka ticelo tema-visa eveni ngalinye lelililunga leSchengen"" (you don't need to apply for visas for each Schengen member). This is the primary benefit described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Konga imali** - While avoiding multiple visa applications *saves* money, the passage focuses on avoiding the applications themselves as the benefit.
* **C: Kugwema tindzawo letinyenti tekuhlolwa kwemapasipoti** - The passage mentions you *might* avoid passport checks if staying within a zone, but it's not the main advantage of the Schengen area.
* **D: Ayifuneki ipasipoti** - The passage states you still need a passport, just potentially fewer checks.



"
Yini lengeke isatfolakala ethuneni la-Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **A: Leminye imihlobiso (Some of the decorations)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lemicebo lemangalisako yalelithuna ayisekho kilo, kepha yasuswa yamikiswa eMsamo weGibhithe eCairo."" This translates to ""The amazing treasures of this tomb are no longer there, but were removed and placed in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.""  This means the decorations (and treasures) are *gone* from the tomb itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Inhloko yemufi (The head of the deceased):** The text explicitly states ""yinhloko nemahlombe kuphela lokubonakalako"" (only the head and shoulders are visible), so the head is still *in* the tomb.
*   **C: Lihlombe lemufi (The shoulder of the deceased):** Similar to the head, the shoulders are still visible within the tomb.
*   **D: Umcebo (The treasure):** While the treasure is gone, it was *removed* to the museum, it isn't something that’s no longer found within the tomb, it’s just not *in* the tomb anymore.

"Ngekwalesicephu, nguyiphi indzawo yaseVancouver lengakhanga kancane bantfu labakhatsateke kakhulu ngemali? ","The correct answer is **C: Bowen Island**.

Here's why:

The text states that Bowen Island is accessible by a ferry from Granville Island in Vancouver and offers activities like kayaking and exploring nature. It doesn't mention a high cost associated with visiting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Granville Island:** While a point of access to Bowen Island, the question asks for a *destination* that is less crowded and more affordable. Granville Island itself is a popular, bustling tourist spot.
*   **B: Indzawo ye-Sea to Sky:** This refers to the route including Whistler, and the text mentions Whistler is ""expensive"".
*   **D: I-Whistler:** The text explicitly states Whistler is ""expensive"".



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguyiphi indzawo lokunematfuba lamakhulu ekutsi yente tivakashi tijabulele i-Vancouver?","The correct answer is **A: I-Bowen Island**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically describes Bowen Island as offering a variety of activities for visitors – kayaking, nature walks, dining, etc. It's presented as a destination *for* tourists. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I-Whistler:** While Whistler is mentioned, it's noted as being expensive and primarily known for winter sports.
* **C: Lidolobha laseVancouver:** Vancouver is the starting point for trips to Bowen Island and Whistler, but the passage isn't focusing on Vancouver itself as a place to *do* these activities.
* **D: I-Granville Island:** Granville Island is a location *from which* you can access Bowen Island via ferry, not a destination offering the variety of activities described.

"Ngekwalesicephu, kunini lapho khona tivakashi kufanele tivakashele Timphophoma natifuna kubuka kahle ngaphandle kwekusitseka?","The correct answer is **D: Nakungasiso sikhatsi setimvula**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ngesikhatsi setimvula (ngaNovember kuya kuMarch), lizinga lemanti litawukhula kakhulu neTimphophoma titawuba nemanti lamanyenti.""  It then warns that you *will* get wet during the rainy season.  Therefore, to avoid getting soaked and potentially not seeing the falls clearly due to the spray, you should visit *outside* of the rainy season.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nga-November kuya ku-March:** This is *when* the water is highest, and you're most likely to get wet – the opposite of what the question asks.
*   **B: Ngesikhatsi setivakashi:** This is too general. The passage doesn't specify a best *time* for tourists, only what to expect during the rainy season.
*   **C: Lapho lizinga lemanti likhuphukile:** Again, this is when it's hardest to see clearly due to the spray.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, buyini buhle bekuvakashela i-Victoria Fall emkhatsini wa-November na-March?","The correct answer is **C: Kumangalisa kwemphophoma** (The magnificence of the waterfall).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngesikhatsi setimvula (ngaNovember kuya kuMarch), lizinga lemanti litawukhula kakhulu neTimphophoma titawuba nemanti lamanyenti."" (During the rainy season (November to March), the water level will be very high and the waterfalls will have a lot of water.)  This directly implies that visiting during this time allows you to see the waterfall at its most impressive and powerful.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kubuka Imphophoma ngaphandle kwekusitseka** (Seeing the waterfall without getting wet) - The passage actually *warns* you will get wet (""Utawuba manti nakanjani nawewela kulelibhuloho noma nawuhamba endleleni leseceleni kwaleMphophoma."")
*   **B: Kunetivakashi letincane** (There are fewer tourists) - The passage says it attracts *many* tourists.
*   **D: Kugwema sikhatsi setimvula** (Avoiding the rainy season) - The passage describes what happens *during* the rainy season, not why to avoid it.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Nawusebentisa ikhamera leyindiza lekutsiwa yidrone hlola kusengaphambili kutsi yini longakhona kuyitfwebula nalovumeleke kuyitfwebula noma kutsi kukhona yini letinye timvume lotidzingako."" (When using a drone camera, check beforehand what you can film and who you need permission from, or if any other permits are required.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kutfola timvume letengetiwe** (Getting necessary permits) - While important, the passage *first* stresses knowing *what* requires a permit.
* **C: Kwenta lucwaningo mayelana netimvume** (Doing research about permits) - Similar to B, research is a step *towards* getting permits, but the passage prioritizes the initial check.
* **D: Kushutha kuphela etindzaweni letigcwele bantfu lapho idroni ingeke inakeke khona** (Filming only in crowded places where the drone won't be noticed) - This is directly cautioned *against* in the passage.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngutiphi tindzawo letincono kutsi ungashutha ngedroni?","The correct answer is **D: Etindzaweni lapho utfole khona timvume kusengaphambili** (Places where you obtain permits beforehand).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states you should ""hlola kusengaphambili kutsi yini longakhona kuyitfwebula nalovumeleke kuyitfwebula noma kutsi kukhona yini letinye timvume lotidzingako"" (check beforehand what you can film and who allows you to film it, or if there are any other permits you need).  This directly supports the idea of getting permits before flying and filming.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage warns *against* flying near people and private property.
* **B:** The passage implies you shouldn't fly where it's prohibited.
* **C:** The passage warns against areas with crowds where the drone might be difficult to control.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""In some cases, only those visiting the places where locals live are required to register."" This directly supports the idea that if you're in a tourist area, registration might not be necessary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Onkhe emave adzinga kutsi ubhalise netiphatsimandla tendzawo** - The passage says registration *may* be required, not that it's required in *all* cases.
* **C: Kungase kudzingeke uye emahhovisi etekungena kwebantfu** - While the passage mentions seeking help from immigration offices, it doesn't say it's *always* necessary.
* **D: Kuletinye tindzawo, emahhotela endzawo ayabhalisa** - This is true according to the passage, but it isn't a statement about a requirement that is *false*. The question asks for a false statement.

Kuletinye timo, ngulabo kuphela labangahlali etindzaweni tebantfu labavakashile lokudzingeka kutsi babhaliswe."" It also mentions needing to go to ""emahhovisini ekutfutsela kulelinye live"" which translates to immigration offices.  A post office is a place one might find such services. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Esiteshini semaphoyisa endzaweni** - The text mentions potentially filling out forms *with* local police, but doesn't state they are a registration *location*.
*   **B: Ehhotela letihlala kulo** - While hotels *may* register you, it's not guaranteed, and the passage says to *ask* if they do. It's not the primary registration point.
*   **D: Emahhovisi etekungena kwebantfu** - This option is not mentioned in the provided text.



"
Ngubani longeke azuze ngekuvolontiya nakaseluhambeni?,"The correct answer is **B: Umuntfu lofuna liholo lelikhulu** (A person who wants a large salary).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that many volunteer positions offer accommodation and food, and some offer a small stipend, *not* a large salary. The passage highlights benefits *other* than financial gain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umuntfu lonelitsemba lekwakha bangani nakakulamanye emave** (A person who hopes to make friends and have other adventures) - The passage *supports* this as a benefit of volunteering (""uhlangane nebantfu labasha"").
* **C: Umuntfu lonelitsemba lekutfola likhono lelisha** (A person who hopes to gain a new skill) - The passage explicitly mentions gaining new skills (""utfole emakhono lamasha"").
* **D: Umuntfu longase abe nenshisekelo yendzawo yekulala nekudla** (A person who might be interested in accommodation and food) -  The passage notes this as a common benefit.

"Ngekwalesicephu, kuvolontiya nawukulamanye emave kumzuzisa kanjani umuntfu lonemali lekaliwe?","The correct answer is **C: Kudla nendzawo yekuhlala ngaletinye tikhatsi uyanikwa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...leminyenti imisebenti yekuba livolontiya utfola indlu yekuhlala nekudla futsi labambalwa babhadala imali lencane."" (Many volunteer jobs provide accommodation and food, and some pay a small amount of money). This directly addresses how volunteering can benefit someone with limited financial resources.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Cishe liholo lihlale likhona (A salary is almost always present):** The passage says *some* volunteer positions pay, but it's not the norm.
* **B: Ngalokuvamile kuholela ematfubeni emsebenti (It often leads to job opportunities):** While the passage mentions gaining skills, it doesn't specifically say it *often* leads to jobs.
* **D: Kungakusita kutsi utive unembono (It can help you feel purposeful):** This is a benefit of volunteering mentioned in the passage, but it doesn't directly address financial benefit for someone with limited money.

"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengase itsatfwe njengaleyetayelekile eluhambeni loluvamile loluya e-Walt Disney World?","The correct answer is **C: Kucitsa sonkhe sikhatsi kuloluhambo usendzaweni ye-Disney** (Spending the entire trip within the Disney area).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...kucitsa sikhatsi lesicishe sibe liviki ngaphandle kwekusuka endzaweni yaseDisney..."" which translates to ""...spending almost a week without leaving the Disney area..."". This describes the typical behavior of those who ""go to Disney World"" as mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kucitsa liviki ubuka ipaki** (Spending a week looking at the park) - While seeing the park is *part* of the trip, the text doesn't say the entire week is spent *just* looking at the park.
*   **B: Kuhlala ehhotela lelingekho endzaweni** (Staying at a hotel outside the area) - The passage implies staying *at* a Disney hotel is typical.
*   **D: Kutsatsa ibhasi kusuka esikhumulweni setindiza kuya ehhotela** (Taking a bus from the airport to the hotel) - The passage mentions flying *to* Orlando airport and going *to* a Disney hotel, but doesn't specify *how* one gets there.



"
Ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako langasilo liciniso mayelana ne-Walt Disney World?,"The correct answer is **A: Emathikithi e-park-hopper ayendluliseleka kuletinye tivakashi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ngisho lona kungumdlalo lovamile, awukavunyelwa nguDisney: nemathikithi awo angeke uwendlulisele kulomunye."" This means Disney tickets are *not* transferable.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

*   **B: Tindzawo tekulala tiyatfolakala khona** - The passage mentions staying at a Disney hotel.
*   **C: Kunemabhasi latfolakalako kuze atsatse tivakashi kuzuka esikhumulweni setindiza kuya kulendzawo** - It mentions flying into Orlando International Airport and traveling to a Disney hotel, implying transportation options.
*   **D: Emathikithi emalanga lamanyenti angatfolakala kumawebusayithi endali** - The passage states tickets are often bought online from sites like eBay or Craigslist (although Disney doesn't allow this).



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuletinkinga letilandzelako lokunematfuba lamanyenti ekutsi kungentiwa eklasini lekucecesha lelicwepheshile nome kulokushicilelwe?","The correct answer is **C: Kulungela indzawo lenemphi** (Preparing for a combat zone).

Here's why:

The passage focuses heavily on training for scenarios involving potential conflict (""kuyaliwa kulo"" - being fought in), weapon handling (""kuceceshwa ngetikhali"" - practicing with weapons), and the type of skills needed in a potentially dangerous situation. It specifically mentions training for a ""secenjini lemasosha"" (military scenario) and the lack of readily available resources on smaller-scale conflicts.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Kusindza ehlane** (Staying safe) - While safety is *part* of the training, the passage focuses on preparedness *for* danger, not simply avoiding it.
* **B: Kulungela lusito lwekucala** (Preparing for first aid) - First aid is mentioned as *part* of the 2-5 day training, but it's not the core focus.
* **D: Kudlala indzima** (Role-playing) - Role-playing is *a component* of the training, used to simulate situations, but it’s not the overall goal.



Therefore, **C** best reflects the overall theme of the passage, which is preparing individuals for the realities and challenges of a combat environment."
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngutiphi kuletihloko letilandzelako lokunematfuba lamancane ekutsi tentiwe eklasini lekucecesha lokucwepheshile?","The correct answer is **B: Indzawo Yemphi** (Battlefield Tactics).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that books and magazines often cover survival in general, but *rarely* cover **small battlefield tactics**. The text emphasizes that this is something taught in the specialized training described, and is often learned through practical experience.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Lusito lwekucala (First Aid):** First aid is a core component of nearly all military/security training and is mentioned as part of the training.
*   **C: Kusindza ehlane (General Survival):** The passage explicitly says survival information is widely available in books and magazines - therefore less likely to be the focus of specialized training.
*   **D: Timo letimatima (Weapon Handling):** Weapon handling and qualification is also mentioned as a component of the training.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumuphi umbono loncono wekugwema emanti lokungenteka angcolile?","The correct answer is **B: Tsenga emanti lasemabhodleleni** (Buy bottled water).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that considering buying bottled water from a reputable source is a good idea, especially because boiling times vary and filters differ in effectiveness.  It highlights the uncertainty around reliably purifying water using other methods.

Let's look at why the other options are less ideal based on the text:

* **A: Bilisa emanti imizuzu lembalwa** (Boil water for a few minutes) - While boiling is mentioned, the passage points out that the *required* boiling time varies significantly by location.
* **C: Bilisa emanti umzuzu lowodwa** (Boil water for one minute) -  The text says one minute is *only* sufficient in *some* places, implying it's insufficient in others.
* **D: Hlola emanti kuze utfole tingoti letitsite** (Test the water for germs) - The passage doesn't mention testing as a solution, and testing requires equipment and knowledge most people don't have.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengase ingenteki ngisho nakubabhukushi labanelikhono?","The correct answer is **D: Kubhukusha utungelete emagagasi** (Being swept away by waves).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...lokungaba yintfo lengenteki"" (which can be something impossible) referring to being swept back by the current.  It describes a dangerous situation where the current pulls a swimmer back out to sea, *despite* their efforts to swim back to shore. This is the ""something impossible"" mentioned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kubhukusha edvute nematje** (Swimming with jellyfish) - Possible, though unpleasant.
*   **B: Kubhukusha emantini lashonako** (Swimming in shallow water) - Perfectly possible and common.
*   **C: Kubhukusha uphambane nemsinga wemanti** (Swimming against a current) - Difficult, but not impossible, and skilled swimmers can attempt it.



"
Yini lokufanele uyente nawubanjwa ngumsinga?,"The correct answer is **A: Yetama kuphuma kuwo ngekuya kulolunye luhlangotsi, bese ubhukusha uya elusentseni.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Emagagasi labuyela emuva elwandle esuka elusetseni...Kufa lokuningi kwenteka ngemphumela yekukhatsala kutama kubuyela emuva ubhukusha...Zama kufinyelela lapho bangeke bakubambe khona futsi noma, kushiyane ngemakhono akho kutsi sebakubonile yini..."". This describes being caught in a rip current ( *emagagasi labuyela emuva*).  The advice is to **swim parallel to the shore** (to get out of the current) and *then* swim back to shore.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bhukusha ngekushesha uphambane nemsinga:** Swimming directly against a rip current is exhausting and ineffective.
* **C: Bhukusha ubheke kulenye indzawo:**  This is not helpful and could waste energy.
* **D: Bhukusha ungene ngephansi kwemanti:** This is dangerous and not a recommended escape strategy.

"Ngekwalesicephu, kukuyiphi indzawo lapho kuvakashela ikhaseli kungase kube yintfo lemnandzi kuyenta nawuseholidini?","The correct answer is **D: Kunome ngumaphi emanti lasekhatsi nelive**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that exploring areas *around* inland waterways (like the Loire, Rhine, Danube, and Erie Canal) is a good holiday option. It lists examples of visiting castles along the Loire, the Rhine gorge, cities along the Danube, and boating on the Erie Canal. 

Therefore, the general idea is that *any* inland waterway area could be a nice place for a holiday, not just the specifically mentioned ones.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lidolobha leligudla iDanube:** While the Danube is mentioned, the passage doesn't suggest *only* cities along the Danube are good.
*   **B: Edvute ne-Erie Canal:** Again, the Erie Canal is an example, but not the overarching point.
*   **C: E-Rhine Valley:** Same as above - the Rhine Valley is an example, not a general recommendation.

Here's why:

The passage specifically warns women to be aware of cultural differences and that what seems like harmless behavior to them might be perceived as offensive or disrespectful by locals. This could lead to conflict.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gwema kucoca ngesimo sekulwa:** The passage doesn't mention avoiding talking about conflict.
*   **C: Gwema kugcoka bucwebe lobukhatitelako:** The passage does mention dressing modestly (not overly revealing), but doesn't specifically focus on avoiding *flashy* clothing.
*   **D: Cina nangabe kudzingekile:** The passage *encourages* women to defend themselves if necessary, and explicitly says not to be afraid to do so.



"
"Ngalokusekelwe endzaweni lechazwe kulesicephu, yini lengase inconyelwe kulabasikati labavakashako?","The correct answer is **D: Endzabeni yekufunwa, cina ekwaleni emadvodza** (In a situation of pursuit, stand up to men).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Kufanele ucine nangabe wala indvodza, ungasabi kwala (kuhlukana ngekwemasiko noma cha, akwenti kutsi kube kuvumeleke!)."" which translates to ""You should stand up to a man if he pursues you, don't be afraid to refuse (whether it's culturally different or not, it doesn't make it acceptable!).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bona kutsi akukavami kulandzelwa** (Know that it is not commonly followed) - While the passage mentions cultural differences, it doesn't advise visitors to *expect* things not to be followed.
* **B: Gwema kugcoka indandatho lenkhulu kukhombisa simo sekulwa** (Avoid wearing a large ring to show a married status) - The passage suggests a ring, but specifically says ""hhayi lebonakala shengatsi idule kakhulu"" (not one that looks *too* big).
* **C: Condza kutsi kwehluka kwemasiko kusho kumelela indzawo yakho** (Understand that cultural differences mean representing your place) - The passage warns against misinterpreting cultural differences as justification for unwanted advances.

"Ngalokusekelwe kulesicephu, ngusiphi simo lesidzinga umtsebuli wetitfombe kutsi asebentise ilensi lekhetsekile?","The correct answer is **A: Nawufuna kushutha tilwanyana letincane**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nawushutha tilwane tasendle ngalokuvamile udzinga ilensi lendze, nakuba tintfo letinjengemhlambi wetinyoni noma tilokatana letincane tidzinga lamanye emalensi."" This directly translates to: ""When photographing wildlife you usually need a long lens, although things like bird flocks or small cats require different lenses."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The text mentions restrictions for *making money* from photos, not needing special lenses for commercial purposes.
* **C:** The text says some animals can be marked or aggressive, but doesn't link this to needing a specific lens.
* **D:** The text mentions park restrictions but doesn't say these require a different lens.

Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungakashiwo kulesicephu njengenkinga lengahle ibe kona kubatsebuli betitfombe?,"The correct answer is **D: Kusebenta etindzaweni letingase tibe nebungoti** (Working in potentially dangerous locations).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tilwane tesiganga tingaba nemahkoni nobe tibe nelulaka. Kantsi indzawo letihlala kuyo kungenteka ibandze kakhulu, ishise noma ibe kabi ekuphileni kwalesilwane ngandlelatsite."" This directly mentions the danger of both the animals themselves *and* their habitats (cold, hot, difficult conditions). This poses a risk to photographers.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **A: Kutfola tilwane letitsite letingakavami (Finding rare animals):** While the passage mentions difficulty in *finding* beautiful animals, it doesn’t frame this as a *problem* for the photographer, just a challenge.
* **B: Kubhekana netilwane letinelulaka (Dealing with aggressive animals):** This is mentioned, but it's presented as a characteristic of the animals, not a major problem the photographer must overcome.
* **C: Kutfola luhlobo lwemalensi ladzingekako (Finding the right type of lens):** The passage says different lenses are needed for different animals, but it doesn't suggest this is a significant *problem*, only a logistical detail.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungase kubangele tinkinga letincane kumshayeli lohamba etindzaweni tetintsaba?,"The correct answer is **D: Kungaboni kahle**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Lokwenta kutsi kungabonakali kahle kungahle kube kutsi liyakhitsika, noma liyahhusha liphephule lichwa noma- ke kugucuka kwemoya ube ngemanti ngalesinye sikhatsi kube lichwa lelisemafasitelweni emoto."" This directly links poor visibility to conditions in mountainous areas (snow, fog, etc.).

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Siminyaminya setimoti:** While tire slippage can be a problem, the passage focuses on conditions *creating* the slippage (snow, ice).
*   **B: Kushayisana lokuphansi:**  This isn’t mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Kushintja kwegesi ibe ngemanti:** This refers to water forming on the windshield due to temperature changes, and is only *one* way visibility can be impaired, not the primary concern.



"
Yini lengase ihlale ingashintji mayelana nemtselo longena emaveni lehlukehlukene?,"The correct answer is **A: Emanani**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""linani lemtselo liyehlukana kulelinye live nakuchatsaniswa nalelinye."" This directly translates to ""the amount of tax differs from one venue to another."" While the *way* the tax is calculated (kwakheka) and *where* you pay it (lapho ufaka khona) and the *rates* (emazinga) might vary, the actual *amount* of tax you pay is what changes based on the venue and location. The passage emphasizes the differing amounts.

Therefore, the one thing that *will* change across different venues is the amount of tax."
"Ngekwalesicephu, nawusebenta kulamanye emave kodvwa uhlala kulenye indzawo, kukuphi lapho kungenteka ufaka khona umtselo wakho wemali lenganako?","The correct answer is **A: Lapho uhlala khona sikhatsi lesinyenti (Where you reside most of the time)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that tax is calculated differently in different provinces/states, and in countries like the US and Canada, tax varies *by province and locality*. It implies that your tax obligations are tied to your *place of residence* rather than simply where you work.  The passage focuses on where you *live* determining your tax responsibilities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: E-United States (In the United States):** This is too broad. The US has different state and local taxes.
* **C: Eveni lapho usebentela khona (In the state/province where you work):** While work location is *a* factor, the passage prioritizes residence.
* **D: Nome ngukuphi lapho imali iphansi khona (Wherever the money is lowest):** This isn't mentioned in the passage and is a simplification of tax law.

Ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako langayichazi kahle i-World Fair?,"The correct answer is **A: Imibukiso ingase ibonise umlandvo nome emasiko elive** (Exhibitions may showcase the history or culture of a people).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Emave latsatsa incenye abonakalisa buciko kanye nemfundvo etindzaweni temphakatsi tesive kubonisa inkinga yemhlaba wonkhe nobe lisiko nemlandvo welive labo."" (Exhibitions showcase art and education in public spaces, showing global issues or the culture and history of their people.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Imibukiso yetitjalo ikhonjiswa edvute nemibukiso yemasiko neyekufundzisa** (Horticultural exhibitions are displayed separately from cultural and educational exhibitions) - The passage distinguishes *between* World Expositions and Horticultural Expositions, but doesn't say they are always displayed separately.
* **C: Imicimbi ingafinyelela etinyangeni letingafika kuletisitfupha** (Events can last up to six months) - While true according to the passage, this describes a *characteristic* of the fairs, not a *definition* of what they are.
* **D: Emave akudzingeki abe yincenye** (Exhibitions do not need to be a part) -  The passage clearly states that exhibitions *are* a central part of the World Fair.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungumtsetfo we-World’s Fair nome i-International Exposition?,"The correct answer is **A: Imibukiso kufanele ikhombise kokubili emasiko elive netinkinga temhlaba** (Expositions should showcase both the cultures of life and the problems of the world).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Emave latsatsa incenye abonakalisa buciko kanye nemfundvo etindzaweni temphakatsi tesive kubonisa inkinga yemhlaba wonkhe nobe lisiko nemlandvo welive labo."" (Countries showcase art and education in public areas, showing global issues or the culture and history of their people). This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Live lelifanako ngeke libambe lemicimbi minyaka yonkhe:** The text says they *should* happen annually if possible, but acknowledges they don't currently.  This is a statement of what *could* be, not a defining characteristic.
* **C: Lemicimbi kufanele itsatse sikhatsi lesifika etinyangeni letisitfupha:** The text states events last from 3 to 6 months - so not *always* up to 6.
* **D: Kuze lombukiso ubanjwe, onkhe emave kufanele ahlanganyele:**  The text doesn't state all countries *must* participate for the Expo to happen.

Kwenta kuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungehlusa ematfuba ekuhlaselwa silwane?,"The correct answer is **C: Kugcina libanga lelingemayadi langu-25 kusuka etimphisini**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""kufanele ube khashane ngemamitha langu-100 emabheleni nasetimphisini futsi ube khashane ngemamitha langu-25 kuletinye tilwane tasendle!"" This translates to needing to be a distance of 100 meters from bears and mountain lions, and 25 meters from other wildlife.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuphatsa emakhambi lanemakha** - The text warns *against* cooking smelly food.
*   **B: Kususa idoti endzaweni yekukhempa** - While good practice, the text doesn't mention this as a way to avoid attacks.
*   **D: Kuvimbela tilwane ngetinsalela tekudla** - The text specifically says to *avoid* attracting animals with food smells.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungakashiwo kulesicephu njengalokungase kube yimbangela yekuhlaselwa silwane?,"The correct answer is **A: Liphunga lelinamandla (Strong smell)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: *""Ngalokwengetiwe, naka kutsi kunuka kubita emabheleni naletinye tilwane tesiganga, ngako-ke gwema kuphatsa noma kupheka kudla lokunukelelako futsi ugcine likamu lihlobile.""* (Additionally, be aware that it smells tempting to bears and other wild animals, so avoid cooking or preparing fragrant food and keep your campsite clean.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kwehluleka kugcina libanga (Failing to keep distance):** While keeping distance is mentioned as a safety precaution, the passage states it prevents attacks, not that it *causes* them.
*   **C: Kunika tilwane tasendle kudla (Feeding wild animals):** The passage implies *not* feeding animals is important for safety, not that feeding them causes attacks directly. It's the smell of food that's the attractant.
*   **D: Tilwane letingakabetayeli bantfu (Animals that don't approach people):** The passage warns that *all* large animals can be dangerous, even those that don't typically approach people.
