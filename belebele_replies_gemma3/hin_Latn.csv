"Passage ke hisab se, accordion ache se bajaane ki kaun si sabse sahi tip nhi kehlayegi?","The correct answer is **D: Atirikt volume praapt karne ke liye apni gati badhayein.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""**accordion par, atirikt volume praapt karne ke liye, aap kuhni ka upyog adhik dabaav ya gati ke saath karte hain.**"" (To get extra volume on the accordion, use your elbow with more pressure or *motion*). However, it also says, ""**Yeh bhi prayaas karein ki aapki ungaliyaan atyadhik gatiwan naa ho.**"" (Also try to make sure your fingers aren't overly fast).  Therefore, increasing speed is *not* the recommended way to increase volume, and the passage actually cautions *against* excessive finger movement.

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct tips according to the passage:

*   **A: Zyada aawaaz ke liye kunji ko zyada dabaav ke sath dabaayein:** The passage explicitly says this is *not* how to get more volume on an accordion (unlike a piano).
*   **B: Apna stamina barkarar rakhne ke liye bevajah ka movement kam se kam karein:** The passage advises to keep your hand as steady as possible and avoid unnecessary finger movement to conserve energy (""jitna ho sakega, apne ko thaka lenge"").
*   **C: Sthir hath rakhte hue notes bajate hue dhyan dein:** The passage directly states, ""**Sunishchit karein ki aapka haath sabhi notes ko sahi se bajaate hue bhi jitna ho sake, utna sthir hai**"" (Ensure your hand is as steady as possible while playing all the notes correctly).



"
"Accordion bajate hue, inmein se kya volume ko badhane mein madad karega?","The correct answer is **B: Zyada dabaav**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Accordion par, atirikt volume praapt karne ke liye, aap kuhni ka upyog adhik dabaav ya gati ke saath karte hain."" (On the accordion, to obtain additional volume, you use the bellows with more pressure or motion.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Zyada gati** (More motion) - The passage mentions motion *along with* pressure, but pressure is specifically highlighted as a way to increase volume.
*   **C: Kam dabaav** (Less pressure) - This would decrease volume.
*   **D: Ungliyon ka kam gatiwaan hona** (Fingers being less active) - The passage actually advises against excessive finger movement.



"
Television par dikhne wali images ki seemaayein kyu cut jaati hain?,"The correct answer is **B: Image puri screen par dikhe**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ise yah sunishchit karne ke liye banaaya gaya taaki tasveer puri screen ko cover kare."" (It was created to ensure the image covers the entire screen). This is the reason for overscan and cutting the edges of the image.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Subtitles dikh jaye** - The passage actually states that subtitles can *be cut off* due to overscan.
*   **C: Dusre formats mein aasaani se conversion ke liye** - The passage doesn't mention anything about easy conversion to other formats.
*   **D: Nichle bhaag ke atyadhik pas subtitles cut ho** - This is a *result* of overscan, not the *reason* for it.



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, movie to DVD format mein badalne mein kisi bhi vyakti ko inmein se kaun si dikkat aa sakti hain?","The correct answer is **D: Seemaayein cut jayein**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""jab aap ek DVD bante hain, toh adhik sambhavana hai ki seemaayein cut jaayengi"". This directly addresses the problem encountered when converting a movie to DVD format.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aisi image jo puri screen par na dikhe:** While overscan *causes* parts of the image to be cut off, it doesn't mean the entire image won't be visible.
*   **B: Aadhe cut hue subtitles:** The passage mentions subtitles being affected *because* the bottom margin is cut, but the primary problem is the margin cut itself.
*   **C: Aisi image jo puri screen par dikhe:**  This is the *intention* of overscan in televisions, but the problem when converting to DVD is that the image is cut *to* fit the screen, not that it naturally fits.



"
British garrison kahan istith tha?,"The correct answer is **C: Bordentown**.

The passage states: ""General John Cadwalder will begin a diversionary attack against the British garrison in Bordentown to prevent any of their reinforcements."" This directly indicates the British garrison was located in Bordentown."
Hath se likhe masaude par kiske hastakshar kiye gaye the?,"The correct answer is **D: Charles Thomson**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ek haath se likhe gaye masaude par congress ke adhyaksh John Hancock **aur sachiv Charles Thomson** dwara hastakshar kiye gaye the..."" ( ""...on a handwritten draft were signed by the president of Congress John Hancock and secretary Charles Thomson..."")

Therefore, Charles Thomson was one of the people who signed the handwritten draft.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: John Dunlap:** He printed the broadsides, he didn't sign the original draft.
*   **B: George Washington:** He *received* a copy and read it to his troops.
*   **C: John Nixon:** He did the first public reading of the document.



"
Di gayi location mein se Dunlap broadside aakhiri baar kahaan pahuchi thi?,"The correct answer is **C: London**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Uski ek copy 10 August ko london pahunchi."" (One copy reached London on August 10th.) This indicates that London was the final location mentioned where a Dunlap broadside arrived.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: New York:** While a broadside was *read* in New York, it wasn't the final destination mentioned in the text.
*   **B: Dunlap ki printing ki dukaan (Dunlap's printing shop):** The broadsides were *made* there, but not their final destination.
*   **D: Independence Hall:** It was the location of the first public reading, but not the final location of a copy.



"
Colonel Stark ke sainikon ka morcha kahan maujood tha?,"The correct answer is **A: Uttari chor par baad ke saath** (On the northern shore with the rear).

The text states: ""Stark ke aadmiyon ne upniveshvadiyon ki isthiti ke **uttari chor par baad ke saath-saath** apna morcha sambhala."" This directly translates to ""Stark's men handled their front on the **northern shore with the rear** of the colonial position.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Samudra tat ke kinare par** (On the ocean shore) - While they eventually extended their line *towards* the ocean shore, their initial position wasn't *on* it.
* **C: Praaydweep ke uttar-poorva mein** (Northeast of Praaydweep) - This is a general location, but doesn't specify *where* on the northeast side their front was.
* **D: Baad ke saamne** (In front of the rear) - This is vague and doesn't describe their position as accurately as option A.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, Stark ke admiyoon ne baad ko aage badhaya?","The correct answer is **B: Sainikon ke nikal jane tak**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gridley ya Stark ne baad ke aage 100 feet (30 meter) tak ek khoonta lagaa rakhaa tha aur order diya tha ki sainikon ke nikal jaane tak koi bhi goli nahin chalaayega.""  This directly translates to ""Gridley or Stark had placed a stake 100 feet (30 meters) beyond the barrier and ordered that no shots be fired until the soldiers had retreated.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Upniveshvadiyon ke balvriddhi ke liye bulane par** - While Stark was called for reinforcements, the passage doesn’t state he advanced the barrier *because* of this.
* **C: Kaam bahav ke dauraan** - The passage mentions a low water flow, but doesn't link it to the barrier's advancement.
* **D: Sainikon ke agrim morche par sochne par** - This option is not mentioned in the passage.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, inmein se kaun sa yug Cheen ka sabse khooni yug tha?","The correct answer is **D: Three Kingdoms wala yug**.

The passage explicitly states: ""The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying to fight for the highest seat in the grand palace in Xian."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jin Rajvansh:** The passage mentions the Jin dynasty *in relation* to the Three Kingdoms period, but doesn't describe it as the bloodiest.
*   **B: Xi yug:** This period isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Han rajvansh:** The passage doesn't specify the Han dynasty as the bloodiest, it only states that the instability occurred *within* dynasties.



"
Passage ke anusaar inmein se kaun si chiz chintiyon ki fauz ke khanabadosh charan mein ane ke lihaz se shi hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Unke pas khane ki kami hoti hain** (They have a shortage of food).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Jab khana kam ho jaataa hai toh basti banjara charan shuru karti hai"" which translates to ""When food becomes scarce, the colony begins the nomadic phase.""  This directly links the nomadic phase to a lack of food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Veh raat ke samay ghonsle banaati hain** (They build nests at night) - The passage says they *march* at night during the nomadic phase, not build nests.
*   **C: Vehaise ghonsle banaati hain jo 17 din baad badla jaataa hai** (They build nests that are changed after 17 days) - The passage states the *entire* nomadic phase (including multiple temporary nests) lasts about 17 days, not that each nest lasts 17 days. And the nests are temporary and changed *daily*.
*   **D: Veh din mein march karti hain** (They march during the day) - The passage explicitly says they march at *night* during the nomadic phase.



"
Passage ke anusaar kaun sa kathan chintiyon ki fauz ke khanabadosh charan ke dauran unki ghonslein banane ki aadat ko sabse sahi se dikhata hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Veh pratidin ghonsla badalti hain** (They change nests daily).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Is charan mein basti asthaayi ghonsle banaati hai jinhen pratidin badla jaataa hai."" (In this phase, the colony builds temporary nests which are changed daily.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Veh raat ke samay ghonsle banati hain** (They build nests at night): The passage only says they *march* at night during the khanabdosh charan, not that they build nests then.
*   **B: Veh ghonsle banaye bina 17 din tak march karti hain** (They march for 17 days without building nests): The passage says they *do* build temporary nests during this phase.
*   **D: Veh charan ke dauran wahi nest istemal karte hain** (They use the same nest during the phase): The passage specifically states they change nests *daily*.



"
Baahari sanketon ki mauzudgi ke bavjood inmein se kaun sa jaari rahega?,"The correct answer is **C: Jaivik ghadiyon**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Jaivik ghadiyaan aatmanirbhar ocilator hain jo baahari sanketon ke abhaav mein bhi mukt chalne wale cycle ko ek avdhi tak jaari rakhenge."" (Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue a free-running cycle for a period of time even in the absence of external cues.)

This directly means biological clocks continue to run *even with* external cues present.  The question asks what will continue *despite* external cues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Antarjaat chakron (Internal cycles):** While related to biological clocks, the passage says biological clocks *contain* these cycles, it doesn't state the cycles themselves continue independently.
* **B: Saamyik lay (Periodic rhythm):** This is a general term for rhythms, but the passage highlights biological clocks as the source of these rhythms, even without external cues.
* **D: Dekhi gyi lay (Observed rhythm):** This is what we *see* happening, and is dependent on the biological clock, but not the thing that persists independently.



"
Kaun sa shabd kuch khas phenotypic visheshta ke kayi roop darshata hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Polymorphic**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Jab vyakti kisi visheshta ke kayi roop dikhaata hai, toh wah bahurupiya hota hai."" (""When individuals show many forms of a characteristic, they are polymorphic."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Monomorphic:** The passage defines this as being *uniform* in a characteristic, the opposite of showing many forms.
* **B: Organisms:** This is a general term for living things and doesn't relate to variation within a population.
* **C: Species:** This is a broader classification than a population and doesn't describe the phenotypic variation within it.



"
Inme se kaun sa un jeevon ke liye shi shabd hai jo kisi vishesh kshetra par kabja kar lete hain?,"The correct answer is **B: Jansakhya**.

Here's why:

* **Jansakhya (Population)** is defined as a group of living organisms of the same species inhabiting a specific geographic area. The passage starts by *defining* population.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Monomorphic:**  Describes a population where everyone shares the same trait – it doesn’t describe the population *itself*.
* **Species:**  Refers to a broader classification of organisms, not a specific group in a location.
* **Polymorphic:** Describes a population *with* variation in traits, not the population itself.



"
Inme se kaun sa prakrti-aadharit paryatan gatividhi ka udaaharan nhi hoga?,"The correct answer is **C: Science museum ka daura (Visiting a science museum)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly defines nature-based tourism as focusing on plants, animals, and ecosystems. The activities listed (hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, park visits, studying ecosystems) all directly relate to experiencing and learning about the natural world.

* **Jharne ki hiking (Hiking to a waterfall)** involves being *in* nature.
* **Jungalee phuloon ki photography (Photography of wildflowers)** focuses on a natural element.
* **Machhli pakdna (Fishing)** is an activity directly utilizing and interacting with a natural ecosystem.

However, a **science museum** is a man-made structure focused on *learning about* science, not directly *experiencing* nature itself. While it *might* have exhibits about nature, the activity of visiting the museum isn't inherently nature-based tourism.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kaun parivahan pranali ka aadhaar hai?","The correct answer is **B: Nijee cars (Private cars)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""aur niji karon par aadhaarit parivahan pranali ka samarthan karta hai"" which translates to ""...and supports a transportation system based on private cars.""  This directly identifies private cars as the foundation of the transportation system being discussed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kaarya sthal (Workplaces):** Workplaces are *reached* by the transportation system, but they don't *support* it.
*   **C: Sthir jeevmandal (Stable biosphere):** The biosphere is being *affected* by the transportation system, not supporting it.
*   **D: Manav vikas (Human development):**  Human development has been *aided* by the stable biosphere the transportation system is disrupting, but is not the basis of the system itself.



"
Naabhik ki parikrama karne vaale kanon me kaun sa aavesh hota hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Dhanaatmak aavesh**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Proton ka dhanaatmak vidyut avesh hota hai jabki neutron ka koi avesh nahin hota."" (Protons have a positive electric charge while neutrons have no charge.)  The nucleus is made of protons and neutrons. Therefore, the particles orbiting the nucleus (which are the protons within the nucleus) have a positive charge.
"
Naabhik kin kanon se bana hota hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Protons aur neutrons** (Protons and neutrons).

The text explicitly states: ""Nucleus do kanon - neutron aur proton se milkar banta hai."" which translates to ""The nucleus is made up of two particles - neutrons and protons.""



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kaun sa paanch bit binary number ka udaaharan hai?","The passage states that a binary number can only have two values: 0 or 1.

Let's examine each option:

*   **A: 1010** - This consists only of 0s and 1s, and has 4 bits.
*   **B: 12001** - This contains the number 2, which is not allowed in a binary number.
*   **C: 10010** - This consists only of 0s and 1s, and has 5 bits.
*   **D: 110101** - This consists only of 0s and 1s, and has 6 bits.

The question asks for a *five* bit binary number. Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 10010**."
Binary ankon ko aur kya kha jaata hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Bits**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...aur in sankhyaon ko hi binary ank - yaa computer ke shabdawali mein **bit** kahaa jaataa hai."" ( ...and these numbers are called binary digits - or in computer terminology, **bits**.)

Therefore, the answer is directly found within the provided text."
Chhaatr bloging ke prathmik labh ke roop mein inme se kiska ullekh passage me nhi kiya gya hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Saathiyon ki aalochna me kami (Reduction in peer criticism)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that blogging leads to improvement in grammar and writing skills (A).** It mentions students improve their writing to avoid criticism from their audience.
* **The passage states blogging ""forces students to be more aware of the world around them"" (C).** This refers to increased awareness of their environment.
* **The passage highlights that blogging encourages collaboration and a better learning experience than traditional schooling, fostering a desire for continuous learning (D).**

However, the passage doesn't say that blogging *reduces* criticism from peers.  In fact, it suggests the *presence* of an audience (which includes peers) *motivates* improvement because of potential criticism.  It's the fear of criticism that drives improvement, not a reduction in it.

Therefore, option B is the benefit *not* mentioned as a primary outcome of student blogging in the passage.



"
Bloging ke kis pahlu ko chhaatron ke lekhan kaushal mein sudhaar ke liye prerak btaya gya hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Aalochna se bachne ki chaahat ko**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Choonki chhaatr aksar sabse aalochnatmak darshak hote hain, isliye blog lekhak aalochna ya sameeksha se bachne ke liye lekhan mein sudhaar karne ka prayaas karna shuru kar deta/deti hai."" (Because students are often the most critical audience, blog writers start trying to improve their writing to avoid criticism or review.)

Let's look at why the other options are less directly supported:

*   **A: Internet par uplabdh samagri par pratikriya dene ko:** While the passage mentions responding to internet content, it frames this as a result of blogging empowering students to be analytical, not the *motivation* for improvement.
*   **C: Apne audience ki ruchi ko banae rakhne ko:**  The passage does mention the need to keep the audience interested (""darshakon ke dilchaspi ko pura karne ki zaroorat""), but it doesn't present this as the primary driving force behind improving writing skills.
*   **D: Sahyog ki jarurat ko:** Collaboration is mentioned as a benefit of blogging, but not as a direct motivator for *improving writing*.



"
Inme se kaun sa chhaatron ke liye atulyakaalik sanchaar ka laabh nhi hai? ,"The correct answer is **D: Bhagam-bhaag se bachaav** (Avoiding rush/hurry).

Here's why:

The passage describes atulyakaalik sanchaar (asynchronous communication) as *increasing* time for reflection and response, allowing students to work at their own pace, and offering flexibility in scheduling.  It *doesn't* mention avoiding rush or hurry as a benefit. In fact, the ability to get immediate answers *reduces* waiting time.

Let's look at why the other options *are* benefits, according to the passage:

*   **A: Ek sansaadhan ke roop mein internet ka upyog** (Using the internet as a resource) - The passage explicitly states the internet provides access to information anytime.
*   **B: Kisi bhi samay shikshakon se milne ki suvidha** (The convenience of meeting teachers at any time) - The passage highlights the ability to ask teachers questions at any time and get immediate responses.
*   **C: Apne hisab se kaam krne ki suvidha** (The convenience of working at one's own pace) - The passage mentions students can work at their own pace and control the speed of learning.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, atulyakaalik sanchaar ka inmemein se kaun sa pahaloo chhaatron ke liye apnane yogya nhi hai?","The correct answer is **C: Shikshan samgree (Educational Material)**.

Here's why:

The passage highlights the benefits of asynchronous communication for *timing* and *control* for students:

* **Seekhne ki gati (Learning Pace):** The passage explicitly states it allows students to work at their own pace.
* **Kaam ke ghante (Work Hours):**  It mentions flexibility in choosing work hours.
* **Internet ka istemal (Use of the Internet):** It emphasizes the convenience of access to information through the internet.

However, the passage **does not** mention asynchronous communication improving or offering flexibility in *educational materials* themselves.  It's about *how* and *when* students access and interact with existing material, not the material itself.

Therefore, asynchronous communication's benefits don't directly relate to adapting the educational content.
"
Passage me kis cheez ka ullekh kisi aesi cheez ke roop mein nhi kiya gya hai jise koi madhya-yugeen quile se jod sakta hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Saurya (Solar)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses medieval castles and evokes imagery of:

*   **Kalkothri ke gaddhe (Dungeons)** - mentioned explicitly as part of the castle's atmosphere (""kabron se uthne waale dar"").
*   **Ghudsawaar (Cavalry/Horses)** - the sound of hooves (""khuron ki khatpat"") is used to create the castle's ambiance.
*   **Shoorveer (Braves/Warriors)** - the passage references battles and implies the presence of warriors defending or attacking castles (""ladaaiyon ke aawaaz"").

**Saurya (Solar) – relating to the sun – is not mentioned or implied as a characteristic associated with medieval castles in the passage.** While castles *benefitted* from sunlight and may have had design elements related to it, the passage doesn't directly connect ""solar"" aspects to the imagery or purpose of castles.

Therefore, **C** is the element not linked to a medieval castle within the provided text."
Inme se kiska ullekh passage me gandh ya dhvani ke roop mein nhi kiya gya hai jise quile ke khandaharon ke beech mahsoos kiya ja sakta hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Daawat (Feast)**.

Here's why:

*   **Yuddh (War):** The passage explicitly mentions ""lambi samay se chali aa rahi ladaaiyon ke aawaaz"" (the sounds of long-standing battles).
*   **Dar (Fear):** The passage mentions ""kalkothri ke kabron se uthne waale dar ko soonghne jaisa"" (like smelling the fear rising from dungeon graves).
*   **Khur (Hooves):** The passage directly refers to ""koyalon par khuron ki khatpat"" (the clatter of hooves on cobbles).
*   **Daawat (Feast):** While the passage *implies* the possibility of feasts occurring in castles (mentioning ""bhojon"" - banquets), it doesn’t describe a smell or sound directly associated with it that one would experience within the ruins. It only mentions the *image* that castles evoke.

Therefore, **Daawat** is the only option not described as a sensory experience (smell or sound) in the passage when imagining being among castle ruins."
Inme se kaun Kirby Muxloe quile ka sateek varnan hai?,"Sahi jawab hai: **B: Nirmaan ke samay desh me shaantipoorn sthiti hone ke kaaran ise nyoonatam quile-bandee ki jarurat thi.**

**Vyakhyā:**

P text mein saaf-saaf kaha gaya hai ki 1480 mein, jab Kirby Muxloe Castle banaaya jaa raha tha, tab desh shaant tha aur bachaav ki zaroorat sirf ghumakkad updraviyon ke chhote samoohon ke khilaaf thi. Isliye, is quile ko lambe samay tak chalne wale hamle ka virodh karne ke liye mazboot banaya jaane ki zaroorat nahi thi.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** Text mein ye nahi kaha gaya ki Lord Hastings ne motee deevaaron ka anurodh kiya tha. Balki, text mein kaha gaya hai ki deevaaren patli hain.
*   **C:** Text mein quile ke nirmaan ki kathinai ke bare mein kuch nahi kaha gaya hai.
*   **D:** Text mein saaf-saaf kaha gaya hai ki quile ko lambe samay tak chalne wale yuddh aur bhari hamalon ko jhelne ke liye nahi banaya gaya tha."
Passage me btayi gyi avadhi ke dauraan inme se kaun si nirmaan visheshta Kirby Muxloe quile ke liye asaamanya mani jayegi?,"Sahi jawab **A: Badi khidkiyan** hai.

Passage me saaf-saaf kaha gaya hai ki Kirby Muxloe quile ki ""badi chamakdaar khidkiyan"" uske mazboot qile hone mein baadh ban rahi thi. Us samay ki quilon mein lambi, chhoti khidkiyan hoti thi jo hamlon se bachaav karti thi. Badi khidkiyan ise asaamanya bana deti thi.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hamlo ko jhelne ke liye bnayi gyi neev:** Passage mein iska zikr nahin kiya gaya hai.
*   **C: Anya quilon ki tulna me kam quile-bandi:** Passage mein kaha gaya hai ki quile ke patli deewaren kamjor hain, lekin kam quile-bandi ke baare mein nahin.
*   **D: Patali deewaren:** Passage mein iska zikr to hai, lekin isko asaamanya nahin kaha gaya hai. Patli deewaren uske kamzor hone ka ek vishishtata hai, asaamanya nahin."
"Passage ke hisab se, aane wale seezan ki taiyai kar rhe runner ke liye inme se kya chiz sbse adhik phaydemand hogi?","The correct answer is **D: Shareer ke upari hisse ki kasarat ke liye gym ka upayog karna**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that runners preparing for the running season (presumably after winter) are joining gyms to build upper body strength. It emphasizes this is ""the most correct preparation for the running season."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Garmiyon me cross country running ka abhyaas** - The passage mentions cross country running *during winter*, not summer.
*   **B: Training ke samay gati badhane par jor** - While speed is important, the passage states that with half-mile races, ""speed becomes less important and endurance becomes extremely necessary.""
*   **C: Teen minute ke andar race khatam karna** - The passage mentions runners who can complete a half-mile in *under two minutes*, not three. This is a specific performance goal, not a general preparation need.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, aadha-mile daudne wale first-class runner ke liye sabse mahatvapurna chiz kya hai?","सही उत्तर है **B: Gati se jyada strength par dhyan dena**

यहाँ स्पष्टीकरण दिया गया है:

Passage में कहा गया है कि जैसे-जैसे दूरी बढ़ती है (जैसे कि आधे मील तक), गति कम महत्वपूर्ण हो जाती है और स्थिरता (strength) अत्यंत आवश्यक हो जाती है। भले ही एक प्रथम श्रेणी का आधा मील धावक तेज़ हो, लेकिन उसे सभी खतरों को सहने के लिए सहनशक्ति (strength) विकसित करने की आवश्यकता है।

*   **A: Shardiyo me cross country abhyas karna** - यह तैयारी का एक तरीका है, लेकिन सबसे महत्वपूर्ण चीज नहीं।
*   **C: Do minute me race khatam krna** - यह क्षमता महत्वपूर्ण है, लेकिन passage में जोर सहनशक्ति पर है।
*   **D: Strength se jyada gati par dhyan dena** - यह passage में बताए गए विचार के विपरीत है।

इसलिए, सबसे महत्वपूर्ण बात गति से अधिक शक्ति पर ध्यान देना है।"
"Ek athelete ke liye, inme se kaun si chiz sirf pooshan se prapt nhi ki ja sakti?","The correct answer is **C: Vishisht pradarshan (Specific performance)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that nutrition *alone* cannot guarantee high performance (""Uchit poshan sambandhi sevan akele kuleen pradarshan utpann nahin kar sakte""). While good nutrition significantly *impacts* overall health and *helps* athletes improve, it's not the sole determinant of exceptional performance.  Factors like training, genetics, skill, and mental fortitude also play crucial roles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Behtar Pradarshan (Improved performance):** The passage explicitly says nutrition helps improve performance.
*   **B: Aanand badhana (Increasing enjoyment):**  The passage states nutrition can increase enjoyment of the sport.
*   **D: Aam dekh-bhaal (General well-being):** The passage emphasizes nutrition's importance for overall health.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, yuva athlete ko apne khel me jyada aanand pane ke liye inme se kya nhi karna chahiye?","The correct answer is **B: Lagatar vishisht pradarshan karna** (Consistently achieving outstanding performance).

Here's why:

The passage states that good nutrition *alone* doesn't guarantee high performance, but significantly impacts overall health and can *help* improve performance and *increase enjoyment* of the sport. It focuses on health, balance, and hydration as key elements. 

The passage doesn't say athletes should strive for constant, exceptional performance.  It implies enjoying the sport is *enhanced* by proper nutrition, not *dependent* on constantly performing at a high level.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uchit poshan lena** (Taking proper nutrition) - The passage explicitly states this is helpful.
* **C: Khoob pani pina** (Drinking plenty of water) - The passage mentions effective hydration habits.
* **D: Swasth oorjaa santulan bnana** (Maintaining a healthy energy balance) - The passage specifically highlights this.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, madhyam duri ka runner adhik mahnga upakaran kyon khareed sakta hai?","Correct answer is **D: Saste upakaranon ko lekar galatfahmiyaan hai**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that there are ""many misconceptions"" about the necessary parts of equipment for middle-distance running.  Players might *think* certain products are beneficial, but the passage says they often don't actually improve performance. This is the reason why runners might buy more expensive equipment - due to these misunderstandings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ye unki apni ichcha hai** - While they *can* choose, the passage explains *why* they might make that choice (misconceptions).
*   **B: Isse unhe laabh milta hai** - The passage states the opposite – expensive items often don't provide a real benefit.
*   **C: Isse unke pradarshan par kafi asar padta hai** - The passage says most extra purchases don't have a significant impact on performance.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, madhayam duri ki running ke liye kya jaruri hai?","The correct answer is **C: Bhut kam upakaran** (Very few equipment).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Madhyaduri ke daud apekshaakrit ek sastaa khel hai..."" which translates to ""Middle distance running is a relatively inexpensive sport..."" and then goes on to say that while there are misconceptions about necessary equipment, you can buy products as needed, but most won't have a significant impact on performance.

This implies that you don't *need* a lot of expensive equipment to participate in middle distance running.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bahut sare upakaran** (Many equipment): The passage explicitly states it's *inexpensive*.
*   **B: Ek sthapit athlete ki prshthabhoomi** (Background of an established athlete): The passage doesn't mention anything about a required athletic background.
*   **D: Bhut sara paisa** (A lot of money): The passage says it is a *cheap* sport.



"
Paramaanu chumbakeey anunaad ki khoj kisne ki? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch aur Purcell**.

The passage states: ""...1930 ke dashak mein felix baloch (stanford vishvavidyalaya mein karyarat) aur Edward Parsel (Harvard vishvavidyalaya) ne NMR ki khoj ki."" ( ""...in the 1930s, Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (Harvard University) discovered NMR."")

Therefore, Bloch and Purcell discovered nuclear magnetic resonance."
Medical imaging resonance ka pahla patent kis varsh kiya gya tha? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The passage states: ""Chaarl saal baad koi patent diya gaya. Yah meri ke kshetra mein jaari kiya gaya duniya ka pahala patent tha.""  This translates to ""Four years later a patent was granted. This was the first patent ever issued in the field of MRI.""  Since Damadian discovered the basis for using MRI for medical diagnosis in 1970, the patent would have been granted in 1974.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **1977:** This is when Dr. Damadian built the first full-body MRI scanner, not when the first patent was granted.
* **1930:** This is when NMR was discovered, not when MRI was patented for medical imaging.
* **1970:** This is when Damadian made his discovery, not when the patent was granted.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, doosaron ke shaareerik kaaryon ki vyakhya karne ke liye manushya ko kis cheez ki gahri samjh honi chahiye?","The correct answer is **B: Irada (Intention)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**dusron ke iraade ko samajhna mahatvapurn hai**"" (understanding the intentions of others is important).  It then provides the example of someone breaking a car window to illustrate how understanding *why* they are doing it (their intention - theft vs. locked out) changes how we interpret the action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ichcha (Wish):** While wishes can influence actions, the passage focuses on *why* an action is happening, not just a desire.
*   **C: Vishwas (Belief):**  Beliefs play a role in intention, but intention is the direct driver of action that the passage emphasizes.
*   **D: Dharnaa (Assumption):** The passage is *about* moving beyond assumptions to understand true intention.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, irade ko samjhne se manushya ko kya karne me madad miltee hai?","The correct answer is **A: Shaareerik kriyaon ke peechhe ki anishchitata ko door karne me** (In resolving the ambiguity behind physical actions).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""यह हमें शारीरिक क्रियाओं के संभावित अस्पष्टताओं को हल करने के योग्य बनाता है।"" (This enables us to resolve potential ambiguities in physical actions.)  The example of the car window being broken directly illustrates this point. Understanding the *intention* behind the action (theft vs. locked keys) clarifies the ambiguity of the physical act (breaking the window).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ichchayen samjhne me** (In understanding desires): While understanding intention *relates* to understanding desires, the passage focuses on clarifying *actions*, not just knowing what someone wants.
* **C: Manushyon ko nirpeksha drishti se dekhne me** (In seeing people objectively): The passage actually discusses the opposite - understanding subjective intent.
* **D: Dusron ke dimaag ko padhne me** (In reading other people's minds): The passage states humans are good at *inferring* intentions, not directly reading minds.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kaun sa AI ka mukhya uddeshya hai?","Correct answer is **D: Karya swachalit karna** (Automating tasks).

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states: ""AI mein anusandhaan mein aise karyon ko **swachaalit karne** ke liye machinein banana shamil hai jinmein buddhiman vyavhaar ke aavashyakta hoti hai."" 

This directly translates to: ""AI research includes creating machines to **automate** tasks that require intelligent behavior.""

While planning (A), speech recognition (B), and scheduling (C) are *examples* of things AI can *do*, the *main objective* of AI, as described in the passage, is to automate tasks.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inmein se kiske saath AI ko joda jaata hai?","The correct answer is **B: Plan karna aur schedule karna** (Planning and scheduling).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Iske udaharanon mein niyantran, niyojan aur samay nirdhaaran..."" which translates to ""Its examples include control, planning and scheduling...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Grahak seva (Customer service):** While the passage mentions ""graahak ke nidan"" (diagnosing customers), it's presented as *an example* of a task AI can handle, not a core association *with* AI itself.
*   **C: Vigyaan kathaayen (Science fiction):** The passage acknowledges a strong connection to science fiction, but emphasizes AI is also a major branch of computer science. It's not *defined* by science fiction.
*   **D: Haath se likhe hone ki pahchaan karna (Handwriting recognition):**  Similar to customer service, this is an example of what AI *does*, but not what AI *is* intrinsically linked to.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inmein se kaunsa sammilit soch pattern waale ki khoobi hai?","The correct answer is **D: Pattern ko yaad rakhna** (Remembering patterns).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Is tarah ke soch waale log taarkik soch rakhte hain, jo **pattern ko yaad rakhne**, samasyaon ko hal karne aur vaigyaanik parikshanon par kam karne mein saksham hote hain."" (This type of thinker has logical thinking, being able to **remember patterns**, solve problems, and work on scientific experiments.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ek samasya ke kai sahi uttaron ki pehchaan karna** (Identifying multiple correct answers to a problem) - The passage explicitly states that convergent thinkers believe there is *only one* correct answer.
*   **B: Samasya par nayi technique lagu karna** (Applying new techniques to a problem) - While they *can* apply techniques, the passage emphasizes re-applying *existing* techniques.
*   **C: Samasyaon ko hal karne ke liye samay lena** (Taking time to solve problems) - The passage focuses on speed, logic, and accuracy rather than a deliberate pace.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inmein se kya sammilit soch ki maansikta ka lakshya nahi hai?","Correct answer is **B: Samay lena** (Taking time).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that convergent thinking aims for **speed (gati)**, logic, and accuracy. Taking time would be the opposite of speed. 

Let's look at why the other options *are* objectives of convergent thinking, according to the passage:

*   **A: Ye samajhna ki sirf ek sahi uttar hai** (Understanding that there is only one correct answer): The passage *emphasizes* this as the most important characteristic.
*   **C: Tathyon ki pehchaan** (Identifying facts): The passage lists fact identification as a goal.
*   **D: Jaankari jutana** (Gathering information): The passage mentions collecting information as part of the process.



"
"Passage ke Hisab se, inmein se kya micro-expression nahi maana jaayega?","The passage defines micro-expressions as facial movements that last for a few milliseconds. Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Baat karte samay kahin aur dekhna (Looking away while talking)** - This isn't a facial *movement* in the same way as the others. It's a change in gaze, but not a fleeting facial expression.
*   **B: Bhau sikodna (Frowning)** - This *is* a facial movement that can happen very quickly.
*   **C: Tez palkein jhapkana (Blinking rapidly)** - This *is* a facial movement that can happen in milliseconds.
*   **D: Thumb’s up ka ishara karna (Giving a thumbs up)** - This is a deliberate gesture, not a fleeting, involuntary facial expression.

Considering the definition of micro-expressions as *brief, involuntary* facial movements, the best answer is **D: Thumb’s up ka ishara karna (Giving a thumbs up)** because it is an intentional, not involuntary, gesture. While A is not a facial expression, D is more clearly *not* a micro-expression as defined in the passage.



Therefore, the correct answer is **D**."
Micro-expressions ke baare mein Inmein si kaunsi baat sach nahi hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Speech ke saath-saath chehre ke expression ki vyakhya ki jaati hai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage actually states the opposite of C.** Oliver Sacks' example demonstrates people with brain damage who *couldn't* understand speech could *still* accurately assess honesty.  This suggests honesty assessment doesn't *require* understanding of speech alongside facial expressions.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

* **A: Video recording se kaafi pragati hui hai:** The passage explicitly states video recording has advanced research into micro-expressions.
* **B: Sahi vyakhya se jhooth pakda jaa sakta hai:** The passage directly states that correctly interpreting micro-expressions can help detect deception (lying).
* **D: Isse imandari ka aaklan hota hai:**  The passage highlights the ability to assess honesty, both in humans (despite speech impairment) and potentially in animals.



"
Inmein se kya punarjagaran ki wajah se mahatvapurn ban gaya? ,"The correct answer is **B: Gyaan ka prasaar (The spread of knowledge)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sankshep mein, punarjagaran se seekhne aur **gyaan ke prasaar** ke drishtikon mein ek mahatvapurn badlav hua hai."" (In short, the Renaissance brought a significant change in the perspectives of learning and **the spread of knowledge**.)

While the passage mentions changes in *how* knowledge was acquired (like memorization improving), the *most important* change, according to the text, was in the overall spread of knowledge itself.  

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Vyaktigat taur par yaad karna (Individual memorization):** The passage states pressure to memorize individually *decreased*, not increased in importance.
*   **C: Paath ko yaad karna (Remembering lessons):**  This is mentioned as a *result* of the change, not the change itself.
*   **D: Jaankari praapt karna (Acquiring information):** This is a general process, the passage focuses on the *approach* to acquiring information changing, leading to greater spread.



"
Punarjagaran ki wajah se inmein se kis par kum dhyaan diya gaya?,"The correct answer is **A: Vyaktigat taur par yaad karna (Memorizing individually)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vyaktigat taur bhitari dabaav nahin banaa, lekin paath ko yaad karne ke kshamata ki adhik ho gayee."" This translates to ""There was no individual pressure, but the ability to memorize lessons increased.""

This implies that *the emphasis shifted away from individual memorization* as the primary method of learning. While the *ability* to memorize increased (likely due to better understanding and methods), the pressure and focus on rote memorization as an individual effort decreased.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Gyaan Praapt karna (Acquiring Knowledge):** The passage states knowledge acquisition changed, but doesn't imply less attention was paid to it.
*   **C: Paath ko yaad karna (Memorizing lessons):** The passage explicitly says the *ability* to memorize lessons *increased*.
*   **D: Jaankari baantna (Sharing Information):**  The passage mentions the spread of knowledge changed, implying more sharing, not less.



"
Inmein se kya satat sambandhon ke liye internet ke prayog ki aham wajah nahi hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Yatra par research karna** (Researching travel).

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the motivations for *ongoing connections* fostered by the internet. It specifically mentions:

* **Learning**
* **Socialization**
* **Private interaction**
* **Sustained relationships**

Let's look at how the other options relate to these motivations:

* **A: Vyapar networking (Business networking):**  This builds sustained relationships (professional contacts).
* **B: Parivaar se jude rehna (Staying connected with family):** This clearly fosters sustained relationships.
* **D: Naye logon se milna (Meeting new people):**  This can *lead* to sustained relationships, and facilitates socialization.

However, **researching travel** is a transactional use of the internet - you get information and then (potentially) go on a trip. It doesn't inherently build or maintain *sustained relationships*.  It’s a task-oriented activity, not a relationship-building one.



"
Inmein se kya niji bhagidari ke liye internet ke prayog ki aham wajah nahi hai?,"The passage focuses on motivations for using the internet like learning, socialisation, private involvement, and sustained relationships. Let's analyze the options:

* **A: Kisi vyanjan ko banane ka tareeka dekhna (Seeing how to make a dish):** This falls under *learning* a skill, which the passage mentions as a reason for internet use.
* **B: Online varta manch par post karna (Posting on an online forum):** This is a clear example of *socialisation* and contributes to *sustained relationships*.
* **C: Healthcare utpadon par research karna (Researching healthcare products):** This is similar to *learning* and can also involve seeking support/advice - a form of social interaction.
* **D: Paisa sambhalna (Managing money):** While the internet is *used* for managing money, the passage doesn’t mention financial transactions as a primary driver of *private involvement* or a core motivation for using the internet. It's a practical application *enabled* by the internet, not a reason people are drawn to it for a sense of connection or personal fulfillment.

Therefore, the answer is **D: Paisa sambhalna**. It's the least related to the motivations of ""private involvement"" and ""sustained relationships"" discussed in the passage.



"
Paschimi Europe ne kab baahari baaton se prabhavit hona band kiya aur apni khud ki shally viksit ki?,"The correct answer is **A: Madhya yug ke ant mein**.

The text specifically states: ""Madhya yug ke ant mein paschimi europe ne apni shally viksit karna shuru kar diya."" This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Byzantine daur ke dauran:** The text says early Gothic style *was influenced* by Byzantine culture, not that they stopped being influenced during that period.
* **C: Madhya yug ke ant ke 25 saal baad:** The text mentions communication delays of 25-30 years, but this refers to how long it took for trends to reach the West, not when they started developing their own style.
* **D: 11veen sadi ke bich:** The text states Gothic style was prevalent *between* the 10th and 11th centuries, but doesn't say that's when Western Europe began developing its own style.



"
Kapadon ko baandhne ke liye button ka upayog kiska natija tha? ,"The correct answer is **C: Dharmyuddh**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""dharmyuddh ke parinamswarup us samay ke sabse bade vikas mein se ek logon ne kapadon ko baandhne ke liye button ka upayog karna shuru kiya"" which translates to ""As a result of the Crusades, one of the biggest developments of the time was people starting to use buttons to fasten clothes.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gothic Daur:** While buttons emerged during the later part of the Gothic period, the text states the Crusades *led to* their use.
*   **B: Byzantine Daur:** The text mentions Byzantine culture influencing early clothing, but not the introduction of buttons.
*   **D: Madhya Yug:** This is too broad – buttons appeared at the *end* of the Middle Ages due to a specific event (the Crusades).



"
"Passage ke hisab se, paryavaran muddon ka inmein se kya lambe samay waala vyavharik hal hai?","The correct answer is **A: Ativyayi jeevan shaili ka tyag karna**.

Here's why:

The passage states that to avoid temporary solutions, we need to ""dhoondh kar unhein nishkriya karna chaahiye"" (find the root of the problems and neutralize them). It then directly links the problems to ""adhik jansankhya aur maanav jaati ke ativyayi jeevan shaili"" (overpopulation and the excessive lifestyle of humanity).  Therefore, abandoning the excessive lifestyle is presented as the core, long-term solution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sakriyta (Activism):** While the passage mentions joining environmental movements and becoming activists, it frames this as similar to palliative care – it helps, but doesn't address the underlying cause.
* **C: Samasyaon ki wajah ki pehchaan karna (Identifying the cause of the problems):**  The passage *does* emphasize identifying the root cause, but identifying isn't enough. You must then *neutralize* it (which leads to option A).
* **D: Paryavaran andolan ke sahyogi banna (Becoming a supporter of environmental movements):** Same as option B - helpful, but not a fundamental solution.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inmein se kaunsa samadhan paryavaran samasyaon ke liye rogsoochak upchaar nahi maana jaayega?","The passage states that living more environmentally friendly and joining environmental movements are *like* symptomatic treatment - they address the symptoms but not the root cause.  The passage explicitly advocates for finding and neutralizing the *root* of the problems as the way to avoid temporary solutions.

Therefore, **B: Samasyaon ki mool wajah ko khatm karna** (eliminating the root cause of the problems) is the solution that the passage *doesn't* consider symptomatic treatment. In fact, it's presented as the *opposite* of symptomatic treatment.

Let's look at why the other options *are* considered symptomatic:

*   **A: Sakriyta mein shaamil hona** (getting involved/taking action) - This is linked to joining environmental movements, which the passage compares to symptomatic treatment.
*   **C: Ativyayi jeevan shaili ke chunav par apne vichar rakhna** (reflecting on choices of extravagant lifestyles) - This is addressing a symptom of the problem (overconsumption) but doesn't address the core drivers.
*   **D: Paryavaran ke saath adhik dostana banna** (becoming more environmentally friendly) -  This is explicitly stated as being like symptomatic treatment.



So the answer is **B**."
Kis desh mein Europe ka pehla yuddh hua tha jiska mool mudda dhaarmik ki jagah shakti santulan sthapit karna tha?,"The correct answer is **D: Spain**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Spanish uttaradhikar ka yuddh pehla aisaa yuddh tha jiska mool mudda shakti santulan asthaapit karna tha.""  This directly translates to ""The Spanish War of Succession was the first war whose main issue was to establish a balance of power.""

Therefore, the first war in Europe with the main issue shifting from religion to balance of power occurred in **Spain**.



"
Kis yuddh ko kabhi-kabhi antim ‘dharmik yuddh’ kaha jata hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Tees Saal ka Yuddh**.

The passage explicitly states: ""is prakar, tees saal ka yuddh ek dhaarmik yuddh kahlaane wala antim yuddh hoga"" (Thus, the Thirty Years' War will be the last war to be called a religious war)."
Catholic Chruch ki inmein se kis baat par jaanch nahi hui?,"सही उत्तर है **B: क्या धर्म के मुख्य सिद्धांत में बदलाव करना चाहिए**।

अनुच्छेद में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि चर्च के धन के उपयोग और शक्ति के केंद्रीकरण पर सवाल उठाए गए थे, और यह भी जांच का विषय था कि चर्च के सिद्धांत पूरे हो रहे थे या नहीं। 

लेकिन यह कहीं भी नहीं कहा गया है कि चर्च के मुख्य सिद्धांतों को बदलने की आवश्यकता पर सवाल उठाया गया था। बल्कि, अनुच्छेद में कहा गया है कि एक मुख्य सिद्धांत यह है कि धन का उपयोग दुःख और गरीबी को कम करने के लिए किया जाना चाहिए, और जांच इस बात पर थी कि क्या चर्च इस सिद्धांत का पालन कर रहा है।

इसलिए, विकल्प B वह है जिस पर अनुच्छेद में जांच नहीं हुई है।"
"Passage ke hisab se, Versailles mein kaun maara gaya tha?","The correct answer is **D: Angarakshak**.

The passage states: ""एक मौके पर तो भीड़ में मौजूद किसी व्यक्ति ने घबराई हुई महारानी के सामने ही वर्साय में मारे गए शाही अंगरक्षक का सिर पकड़कर हिला दिया।"" This directly translates to ""At one point, a person in the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the frightened queen.""

Therefore, the passage specifically mentions a royal guard being killed in Versailles."
Bheed ne raja aur rani ko inmein se kya karne ke liye majboor nahi kiya tha?,"सही उत्तर है **B: Versailles se achanak palayan karna**.

टेक्स्ट में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि भीड़ ने राजा और रानी को Versailles से वापस Paris जाने के लिए मजबूर किया, लेकिन यह नहीं कहा गया है कि उन्हें Versailles से अचानक भागने के लिए मजबूर किया गया था। वे पहले से ही Versailles में थे जब भीड़ ने उन्हें Paris जाने के लिए मजबूर किया।

अन्य विकल्प टेक्स्ट में वर्णित घटनाओं से मेल खाते हैं:

*   **A: Unki gaadi ki khidki kholna** - भीड़ ने उन्हें खिड़की खोलने के लिए मजबूर किया।
*   **C: Guard ka sir katta hua dekhna** - रानी के सामने शाही अंगरक्षक का सिर हिलाया गया।
*   **D: Waapas Paris ki yatra** - भीड़ ने उन्हें वापस Paris जाने के लिए मजबूर किया।"
Inmein se kya Britian ke alag nausena yuddh ka parinaam nahi tha?,"The correct answer is **C: Antarrashtriya kanoon mein badlaav (Changes in international law)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Britain's naval blockade *violated* established international law.**  The question asks for something that wasn't a direct result of Britain's actions. While the blockade caused hardship and provoked Germany, it didn’t inherently *change* international law.  It was the violation *of* existing law.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Germany ki samaan yuddh niti apnaane ki ichchha (Germany's desire to adopt a similar war policy):** The passage explicitly states Germany *hoped* for a similar response to their unrestricted submarine warfare based on Britain's limited pushback.
* **B: Jo jahaaz shaamil nahi the unhe khatre mein daalna (Putting non-involved ships in danger):**  The passage specifically mentions Britain mining international waters, creating a danger even for ships not directly involved in the conflict.
* **D: Aham apoorti pahunch se baahar hui (Important supplies were cut off):** The passage states the blockade was ""effective at cutting off vital military and supply deliveries."" This *was* a result of the blockade.



Therefore, the only option that isn't a direct outcome of Britain's naval warfare is a change to international law. It was a violation, not a revision, of existing rules."
Inmein se kaunsi baat Britian dwara Germany ki samudri gherabandi ko nahi darshati hai?,"सही उत्तर है **D: Isne pakka kiya ki neutral ships ko khatra nahi hoga**.

अनुच्छेद स्पष्ट रूप से बताता है कि ब्रिटेन ने अंतर्राष्ट्रीय जल में खदानें बिछाईं, जिससे तट पर खड़े जहाजों के लिए भी खतरा पैदा हो गया। इसका मतलब है कि तटस्थ जहाजों को खतरा था, न कि यह कि उन्हें कोई खतरा नहीं था।

अन्य विकल्प अनुच्छेद में उल्लिखित जानकारी से समर्थित हैं:

*   **A: Ye Antarrashtriya kanoon ke virrudh tha** - अनुच्छेद में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि नाकाबंदी ने अंतर्राष्ट्रीय कानून का उल्लंघन किया।
*   **B: Isse Germany ke Pandubbi yuddh ki shuruat hui** - जर्मनी ने अप्रतिबंधित पनडुब्बी युद्ध शुरू करने के लिए इसी तरह के प्रतिक्रिया की उम्मीद की।
*   **C: Is wajah se German apoorti mein rukawat aa gayi** - नाकाबंदी का उद्देश्य महत्वपूर्ण सैन्य और आपूर्ति को काटना था, जिससे जर्मन आपूर्ति बाधित हुई।"
"Passage ke hisaab se, Multiple Sclerosis ki pareshani ki sambhavna kise sabse zyada ho sakti hai?","सही उत्तर है **A: 32 साल की एक औरत**।

पैसेज में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि महिलाओं में पुरुषों की तुलना में एमएस होने की संभावना दोगुनी होती है। इसके अलावा, एमएस युवा और मध्यम आयु वर्ग के वयस्कों में प्रमुख है। 32 साल की महिला इस विवरण से सबसे अधिक मेल खाती है।

अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि:

*   **B: 15 साल का एक लड़का** - एमएस आमतौर पर युवा वयस्कों में होता है, बच्चों में नहीं।
*   **C: 43 साल का एक आदमी** - पुरुषों की तुलना में महिलाओं में एमएस होने की संभावना कम होती है।
*   **D: 10 साल की एक लड़की** - एमएस आमतौर पर बच्चों में नहीं होता है।"
"Passage ke hisab se, niyamit gatividhi mein hissa lene wale logon ko kis cheez ke liye sabse zyada madad ki zarurat padti hai?","The correct answer is **A: Dard ke baare mein nakaratak soch (Negative thoughts about pain)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...jo niyamit gatividhi mein hissa le rahe hain, unhein dard ke nakaratmak sanvedana ke roop mein zyada support ki zaroorat hai."" This directly translates to ""those participating in regular activity need more support in terms of negative sensations of pain.""

The passage explains that people regularly engaged in physical activity need help distinguishing between normal discomfort from exercise and harmful pain. This requires a shift in how they *perceive* and *think about* pain, hence needing support with ""negative thoughts about pain"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kamar ke liye (For the back):** While the passage discusses lower back pain, it doesn't say people *need help for their back* specifically, but rather their *perception of pain*.
*   **C: Avsaad (Depression):** The passage mentions depression as a mediator of pain and disability, but doesn't state people actively participating in exercise need help *with* depression.
*   **D: Dar (Fear):** Similar to depression, fear is mentioned as a factor, but not as a specific need for those in regular activity.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, aam taur par talvaarbaazi kaise ki jaati hai?","The correct answer is **D: Duel roop mein**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Aam taur par khel **do roopon mein khele jaate hain, ek fencer aur doosra dwelling hota hai**"" which translates to ""Generally, the game is played in two forms, one fencer and the other dwelling (duel)"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aadhunik roop mein (In modern form)** - While the passage says it's a modern game, it doesn't say it's *generally* played in a modern form.
* **B: Vishvavidyalaya star par (At the university level)** - The passage mentions universities, but that's where the players *learn*, not how the game is *generally* played.
* **C: Olympic star par (At the Olympic level)** -  The passage mentions Olympic training, but doesn't say that's how it's *generally* played.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Andruni vishaaktata ki sabse badi pehchaan inmein se kya hogi?","The correct answer is **D: Prescription ki goli ki bottle** (A bottle of prescription pills).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Internal poisoning ka sabse acha lakshan dawai ya vishaile gharelu rasayanon ke khule dibbe ki maujoodgi ho sakti hai."" This directly translates to ""The best sign of internal poisoning could be the presence of open medicine or poisonous household chemicals.""

While nausea and vomiting (options A & B) are *symptoms* of internal poisoning, they are common symptoms that can indicate many things. The passage emphasizes that these symptoms aren't specific enough for quick diagnosis.  The presence of a container for poison (like a pill bottle) is the strongest indicator.

Option C (stomach discomfort and pain) is also a symptom, but not the *best* indicator according to the passage."
"Passage ke hisab se, kisi peedit ki halat jaanchte samay sabse pehle kya karna chahiye?","The correct answer is **A: Ghatna ko baariki se dekhein** (Examine the scene closely).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Peedit ke jaanch karne ke liye, aapko apni suraksha sunishchit karne ke liye pehle us asthal ki jaanch karni chaahiye.""  This translates to: ""To check on a victim, you should first examine the location to ensure your safety.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Peedit ke paas jayein** (Go to the victim) - The passage says to check the *scene* first, *before* approaching the victim.
* **C: Peedit ki haalat dekhein** (Check the victim's condition) - While you eventually need to do this, the passage prioritizes assessing the safety of the scene first.
* **D: Madad ka intzaar karein** (Wait for help) - The passage doesn't suggest waiting; it suggests a careful initial assessment.

"Peedit ko dekhne ki prakriya mein, yahan bataaya gaya kaunsa kaam nahi karna chahiye?","The correct answer is **A: Apni khud ki choton ko lekar pareshan na ho (Don't worry about your own injuries)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states that if you injure yourself while trying to help, you will only make the situation worse. Therefore, focusing on *avoiding* injury to yourself is a key part of ensuring you can actually help.  The passage prioritizes your own safety *before* helping the victim.

Let's look at why the other options are things you *should* do:

* **B: Peedit se pahle us scene ka aaklan karein (Assess the scene before approaching the victim):** This is directly stated in the first sentence.
* **C: Peedit ki sthiti ko barariki se dekhein (Carefully observe the victim's condition):** This is part of assessing the situation.
* **D: Kisi bhi red flag par dhyan dene ki koshish karein (Try to pay attention to any red flags):** The passage mentions paying attention to signs of danger.

French Revolution se shuru hue kin badlaavon ka shramik varg ke naagarikon par gehra asar pada hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Class ke bajaay kabiliyat par gaur kiya ja raha hai (Emphasis on merit rather than class)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""kranti ke baad vyavasaay sabhi purush aavedakon ke liye khule the jismein sabse mahattvakankshi aur safal hone vaale safal ho sakte the. Yahi sena par bhi lagu hota hai kyonki sena ki ranking warn par aadhaarit hone ke bajaay ab yogyata par aadhaarit hain.""  This directly translates to opportunities in business and the military being based on merit (skill/ability) instead of social class. This is a fundamental shift impacting the working class (and all citizens) by allowing upward mobility.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Desh ke liye support badha (Increased support for the country):** While the revolution *could* lead to increased national feeling, the passage doesn't explicitly state this as a direct effect *on the working class*.
* **C: Republican ideology ko apnana (Adopting a Republican ideology):**  The passage mentions the shift *to* republicanism, but doesn't connect this specifically to a deep impact *on* the working class. It's a broader political change.
* **D: Maapne ka naya system (New system of measurement):** The metric system is mentioned, but it's presented as one of many changes, and not one that directly and profoundly affects the lives of working-class citizens.



Therefore, the most direct and significant impact on the working class (as described in the passage) is the opportunity to advance based on ability, not birthright."
"French Revolution ke baad, military aur anya kaamon mein, safalta milne ka paimana kis cheez par sabse kam aadhaarit tha?","The correct answer is **D: Kshamta (Ability/Merit)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""sena ki ranking warn par aadhaarit hone ke bajaay ab yogyata par aadhaarit hain."" (the army's ranking was now based on ability/merit instead of class). This directly answers the question of what success in the military (and by extension, other professions) was *least* based on after the French Revolution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uplabdhi (Achievement):** While achievement is *a result* of ability, the passage emphasizes ability/merit as the *basis* for opportunity.
* **B: Varg (Class):**  The passage specifically states that ranking was *no longer* based on class.
* **C: Mahtvkanksha (Ambition):** Ambition is important, but the passage highlights that the system allowed the most ambitious to *succeed based on their ability*, not just because of ambition itself.



"
Vikasit deshon mein kaun si saarvjanik seva ki wajah se log sabse zyada nakhush hote hain?,"The correct answer is **C: Saarvjanik parivahan (Public Transport)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Lagbhag sabhi log transport system ke baare mein shikayat karte hain. Viksit deshon mein aap shayad hi kabhi paani ki gunvatta ya pulon ke girne ki milte-julte astaron vaali shikayatein sunte hain.""  This directly translates to ""Almost everyone complains about the transport system. In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing like those about transport.""

Therefore, the passage indicates that public transport is the service people are most dissatisfied with in developed countries.



"
"Diye gaye passage ke hisab se, public transportation systems ke baare mein kya kaha ja sakta hai?","Correct answer is **C: Ve log unki bahut burai karte hain jo un systems ko istemaal karte hain.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Lagbhag sabhi log transport system ke baare mein shikayat karte hain"" which translates to ""Almost everyone complains about the transport system.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ve un sabhi logon ko bahut pasand aate hain jo unka istemaal karte hain** - The passage says the opposite; people *complain* about them.
*   **B: Unki quality paani jitni kharaab nahi hai** - The passage *uses* the comparison to water quality and bridge collapses to show how transport systems seem to have more frequent problems, not that they are better.
*   **D: Zyadatar developed deshon mein ve free hain** - The passage doesn't mention anything about the cost of transport systems.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, drivers ki apratyaashitata ki wajah se kis baat ka aaklan karna sabse mushkil ho sakta hai?","Correct answer: **D: Traffic ka flow**

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states: ""Durbhagya se, traffic flow ka adhyan karna mushkil hota hai kyunki driver ke vyavhaar ka sou pratishat nishchitata ke saath pahle se anuman nahin lagaaya jaa sakta hai."" (Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of the driver cannot be predicted with 100% certainty beforehand).

Therefore, the unpredictability of drivers directly makes it the hardest thing to estimate - the traffic flow itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Traffic ki speed:** While speed is *related* to traffic flow, the passage doesn't say it's the hardest thing to estimate. It's one of the three main characteristics *used to describe* flow.
*   **B: Raaste ki planning:** Road planning uses the understanding of flow, density, and speed, but the unpredictability doesn't directly make planning impossible, just more complex.
*   **C: Sadak par hone wala kaam:** Road work is a separate factor, not caused by driver unpredictability."
"Traffic ki speed ka andaza lagaate samay, inmein se kis cheez ka istemaal kiya jata hai?","The correct answer is **B: Driver ka vyavhaar (Driver's behavior)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while predicting driver behavior with 100% certainty is impossible, drivers generally behave within a ""reasonable consistent range."" This consistency allows for a mathematical representation of traffic flow.  Traffic speed is *directly* impacted by how drivers choose to operate their vehicles.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

*   **A: Sadak par hone wala kaam (Road work):** Road work *affects* speed, but it isn't used to *estimate* speed in general traffic flow models. It's a temporary disruption.
*   **C: Sadak ke raaste ka design (Road design):** Road design influences speed limits and potentially encourages certain speeds, but it doesn't directly estimate the actual speed being driven.
*   **D: Traffic kitna hai (Traffic density):** Traffic density (how many cars are on the road) is *related* to speed, but speed is not *estimated* by simply knowing how much traffic there is. You need to know how drivers are reacting to that density.



"
Hershey aur Chase ne apne DNA ko pratyaaropit karne ke liye kya kiya? ,"सही उत्तर है **D: Viruses**

Hershey और Chase ने DNA को जीवाणु में पहुंचाने के लिए वायरस (specifically bacteriophages) का इस्तेमाल किया। उन्होंने वायरस को रेडियोधर्मी फास्फोरस और रेडियोधर्मी सल्फर से चिन्हित किया, ताकि यह पता चल सके कि वायरस का कौन सा हिस्सा (DNA या प्रोटीन) जीवाणु में प्रवेश कर रहा है और नए वायरस बनाने में शामिल है।

अन्य विकल्प गलत क्यों हैं:

* **A: Radioactive phosphorus:** रेडियोधर्मी फास्फोरस का इस्तेमाल DNA को चिन्हित करने के लिए किया गया था, लेकिन यह वह तरीका नहीं था जिससे DNA को जीवाणु में पहुंचाया गया।
* **B: Genetic material:** यह Hershey और Chase के प्रयोग का परिणाम था, न कि प्रयोग का तरीका।
* **C: Radiodharmi sulfur:** रेडियोधर्मी सल्फर का इस्तेमाल प्रोटीन को चिन्हित करने के लिए किया गया था, लेकिन यह वह तरीका नहीं था जिससे DNA को जीवाणु में पहुंचाया गया।"
Apni aulaad mein mutation pass karne ki kshamta kis chheez par nirbhar karti hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Agar cell germ-line ke hain (If the cells are germ-line cells)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kewal germ-line koshikaon mein vriddhi bachchon tak pahunch sakti hai (Only mutations in germ-line cells can reach children)."" This means the ability to pass on mutations to offspring *depends* on whether the mutation occurs in germ-line cells (cells that produce eggs or sperm).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Genetic material ka kitna asar hai (How much the genetic material is affected):** While the extent of genetic material affected *influences* the impact of a mutation, it doesn't determine whether it's passed on to offspring.
*   **C: Mutation kis tarah ka hai (What type of mutation it is):** The type of mutation affects *what* changes are passed on, but not *if* they are passed on.
*   **D: Agar mutation ki wajah se cell ki death ho sakti hai (If the mutation can cause cell death):**  Cell death is a consequence of some mutations, but it doesn’t determine if a mutation is heritable.  In fact, mutations that cause cell death *won't* be passed on.



"
"Passage mein di gayi jaankari ke aadhaar par, mutation ke alag-alag asar kin cheezon par nirbhar nahi karte hain?","Correct answer is **D: Jis mutation par asar hua hai wo kis tarah ka hai**.

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that the effect of a mutation depends on:

*   **The affected portion of the genetic material (genetic material ke tukde ka mahatva)** - option A and C
*   **Whether the affected cells are germ-line cells (prabhaavit cells germ-line cells hain)** - option B

The passage *does not* mention the *type* of mutation (e.g., point mutation, frameshift mutation) as a factor influencing its effect. It focuses on *where* it occurs and *what* it affects. Therefore, the effect of the mutation does not depend on the *type* of mutation itself.



"
Inmein se wo kaunsi wajah nahi thi ki puraane zamaane mein log bakriyan palte the?,"Sahi jawab hai **C: Ve saathi ban jaati thi**.

Passage mein bakriyon ko paalne ke in wajahon ka zikr hai:

*   **Meat (maans):** ""maans""
*   **Milk (doodh):** ""doodh""
*   **Wool (baal):** ""baal""
*   **Hides (chamda):** ""chamde""

Passage mein bakriyon ko ""saathi"" ke roop mein paalne ka koi zikr nahi hai.  Bakriyon ko unke upyogi utpaadon ke liye paala jaata tha, saathi hone ke liye nahi.

Therefore, option C is the answer which is *not* a reason people raised goats in ancient times."
Golf ka lakshya hai ki kis cheez ka istemaal kam se kam kiya jaaye?,"The correct answer is **A: Gendon**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Wo khiladi jeetata hai jo course samaapti ke liye sabse kam stroke leta, ya sabse kam baar club ko ghumaata hai.""  A ""stroke"" in golf means hitting the ball with the club. Therefore, the goal is to use the club (and thus hit the ball - the ""genda"") the fewest times.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tez prahar (Fast hit):** While hitting the ball with force is part of the game, it's not the *goal* to hit it fast, but to get it in the hole with the fewest strokes.
* **C: Samay (Time):** There isn't a time limit in golf.
* **D: Chhed (Holes):** The goal isn't to use the holes the least, but to complete all of them.



"
Golf course mein kis jagah par ghaas chhoti kaati jaati hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Pahle chhed par**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Khel ghas par khela jaataa hai, aur chhed ke chaaron or ghas ko chhota rakhaa jaataa hai aur use green kahaa jaataa hai."" This means the grass around *each hole* (including the first) is kept short. The passage doesn't specify only the 18th hole.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Atthaharvein chhed par** - While the grass is short around the 18th hole, it's short around *all* holes.
*   **B: Hari ghaas par** - This is too general. The passage is specifically about the *short* grass.
*   **D: Golf course ke pahle hisse mein** - The passage talks about the grass *around the holes*, not a general section of the course.



"
"Aamtaur par, kisi prayog ka kya maqsad hota hai?","The passage about golf doesn't discuss the purpose of experiments. It describes a game. Therefore, none of the options (A, B, C, or D) are relevant to the given text. 

However, if forced to choose the *most* generally applicable answer, **B: Ye pata lagana ki duniya kaise kaam karti hai** is the closest. While golf itself isn't an experiment, the *desire* to improve at golf (and understand how to hit the ball further, straighter, etc.) could be framed as trying to understand how the world (in this case, physics of the golf swing and ball flight) works.

But again, it's important to note that this is a stretch and the passage doesn't directly address the question. The question is poorly matched to the given text.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, scientific research ko guide karne mein kya cheez madad nahi karti?","The correct answer is **A: Sirf vaigyaanik tariko par kaam karna**.

Here's why:

The passage states that scientific research is guided by experimentation, observation, and eliminating potential hypotheses. It also mentions that while the scientific method is *central*, it's not the *only* thing that guides research.  

Option A, ""Sirf vaigyaanik tariko par kaam karna"" (working *only* on scientific methods), directly contradicts this idea. The passage implies research needs more than just rigid adherence to methods – it needs observation, questioning, and testing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Observe karna (Observation)** - The passage explicitly states observation guides scientific discovery.
* **C: Sambhavit parikalpana ko khatm kar dena (Eliminating potential hypotheses)** - The passage mentions this as part of the experimental process that guides research.
* **D: Prayog karna (Experimentation)** -  The passage clearly states experimentation is a crucial part of guiding scientific discovery.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, tornado ke bare me kaun sa kathan galat hai?","The correct answer is **C: Jyadatar tornado teen ghanto se jyada samay tak ke liye aate hai**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""**Sabse adhik hinsak do pratishat bavandar teen se adhik ghanton tak bane rehte hain.**"" (The most violent two percent of tornadoes last more than three hours.) This means *most* tornadoes do **not** last more than three hours.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Tornado apne kshetra me padne wali har chiz ko nasta kr sakte hai** - The passage explicitly states they ""can destroy everything in their path.""
* **B: Anya toofano ke mukable, tornado chhote kshetra tak seemit rhte hai** - The passage begins by stating tornadoes ""attack a small area compared to other dangerous storms.""
* **D: Kuch tornado aese hote hai jinme hawa ki gati 300 mile prati ghante tak hoti hai** - The passage states tornadoes have winds up to ""480 kilometer/ghanta (300mph).""



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kaun sa kathan jyadatar tornado ke bare me jankari deta hai?","The correct answer is **B: Inme hawa ki gati lagbhag 480 mile prati ghante hoti hai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""In khatarnaak tufaanon mein 480 kilometer/ghanta (133my/second; 300mph) tak ki havaayen hoti hain.""  This is a direct detail about tornadoes provided in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage says the *most violent* 2% last over three hours, not that they *generally* do.
* **C:** The passage explicitly states tornadoes affect a *small* area compared to other storms.
* **D:** While the passage *mentions* tornadoes uproot trees, it's just one example of their damage, and not the most defining characteristic highlighted in the text. The wind speed is the most striking and specific piece of information provided.



"
Inme se kaun sa kaam manav ne 16vi shatabdi me krna shuru kar diya tha?,"The correct answer is **D: Doorbeen bnana**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""pehli vaastavik doorbeen 16ween shatabdi ke ant mein europe mein banaai gayi thi."" (The first actual telescope was made in Europe at the end of the 16th century.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lense ka istemal karna (Using lenses):** The passage states humans have been making and using lenses for ""hazaaron aur hazaaron salon"" (thousands and thousands of years) – long before the 16th century.
* **B: Chizon ko bda karke dekhna (Seeing things bigger):** Using lenses to magnify objects predates the 16th century.
* **C: Lense bnana (Making lenses):**  Like using lenses, making them also predates the 16th century.



"
"Lense ka istemal karke, manav kab se chizon ko bda karke dekh rha hai?","The correct answer is **C: Hazaron saloon se**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Manushya hazaaron aur hazaaron salon se aavardhan ke liye lens banaa rahe hain aur istemal kar rahe hain."" This directly translates to ""Humans have been making and using lenses for magnification for thousands and thousands of years.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ek hazar saloon se (One thousand years):** While accurate, the passage says ""thousands *and* thousands"" (hazaaron aur hazaaron), implying a much longer period.
* **B: 16vi shatabdi ke uttrardh se (From the latter half of the 16th century):** This is when the *first practical telescope* was made, not when people started using lenses for magnification.
* **D: 16vi shatabdi ki shuruat se (From the beginning of the 16th century):**  Similar to B, this refers to telescope development, not the long history of lens use.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Muhammad ki gufa se unke adhyatmik karm-kando ya mulyon ke bare me kya pta chalta hai?","The correct answer is **A: Ve shanti aur ekant ko mahatva dete the (They valued peace and solitude)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Unhone khud ko ekant karaa , jo kayee samay tak rahaa, yah muhammad ke aadhyaatmik jhukav ki ek bahut hi ujjwal chhavi deta hai."" (They isolated themselves for a long time, which is a very bright image of Muhammad's spiritual inclination). This directly indicates a preference and value for solitude for spiritual purposes.
* **The description of the cave:** The passage describes the cave as being completely cut off from the world, hard to find, and offering complete isolation. This reinforces the idea that Muhammad *sought* this peaceful, solitary environment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bahri shor chinatan me madad kar sakta hai (External noise can help in contemplation):** The passage describes a place *free* from external noise, the opposite of this statement.
* **C: Unhe bahut kam samay tak akele rahna pasand tha (They preferred to be alone for a very short time):**  The passage states he would isolate himself for *long periods* (""kayee samay tak rahaa"").
* **D: Ve chahte the ki jyada se jyada loog unhe dekhe aur sune (They wanted as many people as possible to see and hear them):**  The entire description of the hidden, isolated cave contradicts this.  He specifically sought a place where he *wouldn't* be seen or heard.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, sabse pahle lohe ka istemal kisliye kiya gya?","The correct answer is **D: Patriyan (Rails)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Patriyon ko unke aasthan par banaaye rakhne ke liye crostai ko kafi pahle vyavhaar mein laya gaya tha. lekin dhire-dhire yah mahsoos hua ki agar patriyon oopar lohe ki patti ho toh ve zyada daksh hongi.""

This translates to: ""Crosties were used early on to keep the rails in place. But it was gradually realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had iron strips on top.""

Therefore, iron was first used on the rails (patriya) to improve their efficiency.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, lakdi ke bjay lohe ke pahiye kyo istemal kiye jane lage?","The correct answer is **D: Ve patriyon par lge lohe se ghise rhe the** (They were wearing out due to the iron on the rails).

Here's why:

The passage states that iron wagonways became common, but the iron wheels wore down the wooden wheels quickly. This led to the eventual replacement of wooden wheels with iron wheels.  The passage doesn't mention increasing speed, capacity, or general efficiency as the *reason* for the switch – it highlights the wear and tear issue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ghodon ki gati badhane ke liye** (To increase the speed of the horses) - The passage says horses could pull them faster, but doesn't link this to the wheel material change.
*   **B: Unki dakshta jyada thi** (They were more efficient) - Efficiency is mentioned as a benefit of iron rails, but not specifically of iron wheels *initially*.
*   **C: Unse jyada bhari saman dhoya ja sakta tha** (More heavy goods could be carried with them) - The passage states horses could carry more on the *wagonways*, but not because of the wheel material.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Rumaniyatwad ke dauran logon ne kya bnaya?","The correct answer is **D: Sanskriti**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...*samay ke saath-saath us bhugol se judey reeti-rivaaj aur sanskriti utpann hui*."" ( ""...customs and culture arose with time connected to that geography"").  It also states that Romanticism emphasized a connection to the geography and, over time, that geography fostered customs *and* culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kanoon (Laws):** The passage contrasts Romanticism *against* arbitrary laws, saying people connected to their place were *better than* arbitrarily imposed laws.
*   **B: Bhugol (Geography):**  While geography is mentioned as a foundation, the passage doesn't say they *created* geography; it existed and influenced them.
*   **C: Reeti-rivaaj (Customs):** Customs are mentioned, but the passage highlights both customs *and* culture as things that developed. Culture is the broader, more encompassing answer.



"
"Inme se kaun sa kathan, Technological nirdhaaranvaad ke samanya siddhant ko vyakta nhi karta hai? ","The correct answer is **A: Samaj aur samajik sthitiyon par takneek ka asar padta hai (Technology affects society and social conditions)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that technological determinism argues *against* the idea that culture or politics influence technological development. It asserts that technology *shapes* society, not the other way around.  

Let's look at why the other options *do* represent the core tenets of technological determinism as described in the passage:

* **B: Saanskriti ka koi asar takneeki vikas par nhi padta hai (Culture has no effect on technological development):** The passage directly states this is a central idea of technological determinism.
* **C: Takneek ka samaj par antarnihit asar hota hai (Technology has an inherent effect on society):**  The passage describes how technology is seen as inherently driving societal changes, rather than simply being adapted to societal needs.
* **D: Takneeki vikas par rajneetik asar nhi hota (Political impact does not occur on technological development):** Similar to culture, the passage indicates that technological determinism believes political factors don't influence technological progress.



Therefore, option A is the only statement that *contradicts* the principles of technological determinism as explained in the given text."
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kaun sa kathan bow khichne se sambandhit nhi hai?","Correct answer is **A: Mridu dhwani**.

Here's why:

The passage states that an *up bow* (V-shaped symbol) typically produces a *soft* (mridu) sound. However, the question asks for something **not** related to the act of *drawing* the bow itself (how you move the bow).

Let's break down the other options:

*   **B: Chinh jo staple ki tarah dikhta hai** -  The passage explicitly mentions the ""down bow"" symbol looks like a staple. This is directly related to the bowing technique.
*   **C: Adhik dhwani** - The passage states ""down bow"" is *stronger and more pronounced* (adhik mukhar), relating to the sound produced by the bow movement.
*   **D: Shirsh se shuru karna** - The passage says ""forward means you should start from the tip and push the bow"", indicating how to draw the bow.

Therefore, while ""mridu dhwani"" is *a result* of a specific bowing technique (up bow), it's not a description of the *action of drawing the bow* itself. It's a description of the sound *created* by that action."
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kaun sa kaam mridu dhwani se sambandhit hai?","The correct answer is **C: V ki tarah dikhne wala chinh**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ek oopri-chaap aam taur par ek mridu dhwani utpann karta hai..."" and ""up bow chihn V ki tarah dikhta hai...""  Therefore, the V-shaped mark (up bow) is associated with a softer sound.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Down bow chinh:** The passage says a down bow creates a ""mazboot aur adhik mukhar"" (stronger and more prominent) sound, not a soft one.
*   **B: Bow khichna:** This refers to drawing the bow from the frog, which creates a stronger sound.
*   **D: Wha se shuru krna jha se aapne bow pakda hua hai:** This also refers to the frog and a stronger sound.



"
"Jeevaashm ke hisab se, hathon ka istemal mukhya roop se kis kaam ke liye kiya jata tha?","The correct answer is **A: Manipulation ke liye** (For manipulation).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jeevaashm ke haath ke haddiyaan do millionse teen million saal purani hain, yah haath ke visheshagyata ko locomotionse manipulation tak badalane ke baare mein bataati hain.""  This directly translates to: ""Fossil hand bones two to three million years old indicate a change in hand specialization *from* locomotion *to* manipulation.""

Therefore, the fossils show hands were evolving *towards* being used for manipulation.



"
Inme se kaun Chimpanji ke phalanges ki sahi jankari deta hai? ,"The correct answer is **C: Ve bhaar vahan karne ke kaam aate the** (They were used for carrying weight).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Chimpanji ka haath aur pair aakar aur lambai mein samaan hote hain, jo ghutanon ke ball chalane mein bhar vahan karne ke liye haath ke upayog ko darshaata hai."" (Chimpanzee hands and feet are the same in shape and length, which demonstrates the use of hands for carrying weight in knuckle-walking.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ve manvo se jyada seedhe the’** (They were straighter than humans) - The passage does *not* mention the straightness of chimpanzee phalanges compared to humans. It focuses on their size and function.
* **B: Unke hath aur pairon ka aakar alag-alag tha** (Their hands and feet were different in shape) - The passage explicitly says their hands and feet are the *same* shape.
* **D: Ve mukhya roop se manipulation ke liye istemal kiye jate the** (They were mainly used for manipulation) - The passage links the chimpanzee hand structure to weight-bearing during knuckle-walking, not primarily to manipulation. Manipulation is highlighted as a *shift* in function for humans.



"
Chayan nayi aanuvanshik bhinnata ko kis pool se nikal deta hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Vyakt** (Expressed).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Utparivartannei aanuvanshik bhinnata jodata hai, aur **chayan ise vyakt bhinnata ke poolse nikal deta hai**.""  This directly translates to ""Mutations add genetic variation, and **selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Chhupa hua (Hidden):** The passage says selection acts on *expressed* variation, not hidden variation.
* **B: Punarsanyojan (Recombination):** Recombination *moves* variation between pools, it doesn't have selection acting *on* it to remove it.
* **C: Algaav (Segregation):**  Like recombination, segregation is a process that shifts variation between pools, not where selection removes it from.



"
Aanuvanshik bhinnata ko jodne ka kaam kaun si prakriya karti hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Utparivartannei (Mutation)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Utparivartannei aanuvanshik bhinnata jodata hai..."" which translates to ""Mutation adds genetic variation..."". 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Algaav (Segregation):**  The passage says segregation *moves* variation between the pools, it doesn't *add* it.
*   **B: Punarsanyojan (Recombination):** Similar to segregation, recombination *moves* variation, but doesn't create new variation.
*   **D: Vyakt (Expressed):**  ""Expressed"" refers to the visible traits and doesn't generate the underlying variation.

"Passage me di gyi jankari ke hisab se, “protein ki samasya” ko door karne ke liye inme se kya khana chahiye?","The correct answer is **C: Tidde (Chintiyan)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""iske vipreet, pashu khaadya padaarth (chintiyan, deemak, andey) naan kewal aasaani se pachane yogya hote hain, balki way uchch matra mein protein pradhan karte hain jismein sabhi zaruri amino acid hote hain."" 

This translates to: ""Conversely, animal food sources (locusts/grasshoppers, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest but also rich in protein containing all the essential amino acids.""  The passage highlights that animal sources, like locusts, efficiently solve the ""protein problem.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mrit pattiyan (Dry Leaves):** The passage says leaves are difficult to digest without cooking.
*   **B: Kacchi faliyan (Raw Beans/Pods):**  Similarly, the passage states raw pods are hard for primates to digest.
*   **D: Fuloon ke tane (Flower Stems):** The passage doesn't mention flower stems as a source of protein.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kaun si samasya amino-acid ki kami ki wajah se nhi hoti hai?","Correct answer is **A: Pachan ki samasyaen**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that primates have difficulty digesting plant-based proteins *without cooking*. It doesn't say that a lack of amino acids *causes* digestive problems. Instead, it says digestion is difficult due to the nature of plant matter.  The passage links amino acid deficiency to depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death, but doesn't list digestive issues as a direct consequence of the deficiency itself.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

*   **B: Kuposhan** - The passage directly mentions ""kuposhan"" (malnutrition) as a serious consequence of not getting enough amino acids.
*   **C: Kam vikas** - Though not directly stated as ""kam vikas"", depression and malnutrition will inhibit development.
*   **D: Mrityu** - The passage states that failure to meet amino acid needs can ""antatah mrityu"" (ultimately lead to death).



"
"Aamtaur par, upsanskriti ke sadasya apni sanskriti ke sath kaise judav vyakt karte hai?","The correct answer is **D: shally ka prateekatmak upayog karke** (by using symbolic symbols).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ek upsanskriti ke sadasya aksar shally ke ek vishisht aur prateekatmak upayog ke madhyam se apni sadasyata ka sanket dete hain, jismen fashion, taur-tareeke aur khaas boli shamil hain."" (A member of a subculture often signals their membership through a specific and symbolic use of symbols, including fashion, manners, and specific language).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ghulne-milne ka prayaas karke** (By trying to blend in) - Subcultures often *resist* blending in and actively distinguish themselves.
*   **B: Apne aas-paas ke logon ki maanyataon ko apnaakar** (By adopting the beliefs of those around them) - Subcultures often have beliefs that *differ* from mainstream society.
*   **C: Samajik maandandon ko sveekar karke** (By accepting social norms) - Subcultures often challenge and reject existing social norms.

"Passage me diye gye siddhaant ke hisab se, us bachche ka kya hoga jo ek nasleey alpasankhyak aur khataranaak gatividhiyon me shamil hone wala mana jata hai?","The correct answer is **B: Vo bachcha khataranaak gatividhiyon me aur jyada shamil hone lagega**.

Here's why:

The passage states that awareness of stereotypes can *influence* behavior.  It specifically gives the example of racial minorities perceived as not doing well in school – when they become aware of that stereotype, they are *more likely* to underperform.  

Applying that same logic to the question: If a child is part of a racial minority perceived as engaging in dangerous activities, becoming aware of that stereotype would likely lead them to *increase* their involvement in those activities, mirroring the example given in the passage.  The passage doesn't suggest stereotypes cause positive change (stopping the activity) or social withdrawal.

Therefore, option B is the most consistent with the principle outlined in the passage."
"Passage ke hisab se, bachche ki nasleey roodhivaadita ki samajh ka asar inme se kis par padega?","The correct answer is **B: Unke vyavhaar par (Their behavior)**.

Here's why:

The passage directly states: ""ye jaatiya roodhiyaan vyavhaar ko prabhaavit karti hain"" which translates to ""these racial prejudices affect behavior.""  The example given illustrates how understanding a negative stereotype associated with their race leads children to *act* in a way that confirms that stereotype (performing poorly in school).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Us nasleey alpasankhyak samaj par jiske sath usne judne ka vikalp chuna hai (The racial minority community they chose to identify with):** The passage doesn't discuss a *choice* of identification, it discusses inherent awareness of prejudice linked to their existing racial identity.
* **C: Anya bachchon ke sath unke vyavhaar par (Their behavior with other children):** While it *could* indirectly affect their interactions, the primary impact stated is on *their own* behavior.
* **D: Us nasla ko lekar unki soch par (Their thinking about that race):** The passage focuses on the *impact* of awareness of prejudice on action, not necessarily on internal thought processes, though that's a possible consequence.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, jangalee bachche ke paalan-poshan me inme se kis chiz ki kami rhne ki sambhaavna hai?","The correct answer is **B: Baat-cheet karne ki kushalta (Communication skills)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""wild children"" often behave like animals, displaying fear or indifference towards humans. This indicates a severe lack of **socialization**, which includes learning how to interact and communicate with others.  They haven't been taught the nuances of human interaction, hence their communication skills would be severely underdeveloped.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: svatantra roop se rahna (Living independently):** While they *end up* living independently (due to being isolated), the passage doesn't suggest a lack of ability to do so. Their independence is a *result* of neglect, not a deficiency in their inherent ability.
* **C: Ekaantapriya pravritti (Introverted tendencies):** The passage describes fear or indifference, not necessarily a preference for solitude. Their behaviour is a result of trauma and lack of interaction, not a personality trait.
* **D: Saamaajik ghabraahat (Social anxiety):**  While they *might* experience fear around people, it's more accurate to say they lack the understanding of social cues and norms – anxiety implies an awareness of social situations and worry about them, which isn't explicitly stated in the passage.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kaun sa kathan bachchon mein jangalee vyavhaar ka sateek varnan karta hai?","The correct answer is **B: Samajikaran ki kami se jangalee vyavhaar utpann ho sakta hai** (Lack of socialization can lead to feral behavior).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that these children were not neglected *simply* but through neglect, misfortune, or abuse.** It highlights cases where children were isolated from the world, either by parents or through circumstances like being abandoned.
* **The passage describes how these isolated children behave *like* animals – showing fear or indifference towards humans.** This demonstrates a lack of socialization, where they haven't learned typical human behaviors.
* **The passage connects the behaviour to a lack of human interaction, not solely to physical or mental disabilities.** While disabilities are mentioned as *a reason* some parents isolate children, it's not the only reason, and the core issue is the lack of human connection and learning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jyadatar jangalee vyavhaar shaareerik kami ke kaaran hote hain** (Most feral behavior is caused by physical deficiencies) - The passage states physical deficiencies can *be* a reason, but it's not the *main* or *most common* reason.
* **C: jangalee vyavhaar keval un bachchon mein paya jata hai jinhen unke mata-pita ne tyaag diya hai** (Feral behavior is only found in children abandoned by their parents) - The passage mentions children raised by animals or living alone in the wild, not just those abandoned by parents.
* **D: Sabhi jangalee vyavhaar gambhir bauddhik akshamataon ke kaaran hote hain** (All feral behavior is caused by severe intellectual disabilities) - The passage doesn't state that *all* feral behavior stems from intellectual disabilities; it highlights isolation and abuse as major factors.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kaun si pratha nirvaah krishi ke anuroop nhi hai?","The correct answer is **B: Bechne ke liye bhojan ka utpaadan karna (Producing food for sale)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Nirvaah krishi kewal krishak tatha uske parivar ke aavashyaktaon ko pura karne..."" meaning subsistence farming focuses *only* on fulfilling the needs of the farmer and their family.  Producing food for sale (commercial farming) is the opposite of this.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with the passage:

*   **A: Aesi upaj par dhyaan kendrit karna jo kisaan ke parivaar ki jaroraton ko poora karti ho (Focusing on produce that meets the farmer's family needs):** This *is* what subsistence farming is all about.
*   **C: Unnat takaneekon ke bjay jyada se zyada upaj par dhyan kendrit karna (Focusing on maximizing yield instead of advanced techniques):** The passage mentions using simple, often organic, methods and local seeds - implying a lack of reliance on advanced technology.
*   **D: kisaan ke kshetra ke liye sthaaneey beej uplabdh krana (Providing local seeds for the farmer's field):** The passage specifically mentions the use of locally adapted seeds.



"
Inme se kaun nirvaah krishi ka sateek varnan krta hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Yah puri tarah jaivik pranaali hai (It is a completely organic system)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Jeevika aadhaarit kheti ek aasaan, aksar jaivik, pranali hai..."" (Subsistence farming is an easy, often organic, system...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Isme faslon ka utpadan badhane ke liye anoothee takaneekon ka upayog kiya jata hai (It uses unique techniques to increase crop production)** - The passage says it uses *simple* techniques, not necessarily *unique* ones aimed at maximizing yield. It focuses on meeting needs, not maximizing production.
* **C: Isse kisano ko apni fasal apne kshetra me share karne ki suvidha milti hai (It allows farmers to share their crops within their area)** - The passage doesn't mention sharing. It's about producing enough for the farmer and their family.
* **D: Kuchh deshon mein kisan abhi bhi iska upayog karte hai (Farmers still use it in some countries)** - While true (stated in the passage), this doesn't *define* what subsistence farming *is*. It's a fact *about* it, not a description *of* it.



"
Kisi sangrahalay ka daura karna paryatan ki kis shrenee mein aaega?,"The correct answer is **C: Saanskrtik paryatan (Cultural Tourism)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yadi kisi vyakti ke kisi vishesh asthan ke yatra ka uddeshya uske itihas aur sanskriti ko jaanna hai toh is prakar ke paryatan ko saanskritik paryatan ke roop mein jaanaa jaataa hai."" (If a person's purpose of traveling to a particular place is to know its history and culture, then this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.)

Visiting a museum is directly related to learning about history and culture. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vyaapaar paryatan (Business Tourism):**  This involves travel for work purposes, like conferences.
*   **B: Manoranjak paryatan (Recreational Tourism):** This focuses on fun and entertainment like beaches and theme parks.
*   **D: Outdoor paryatan (Outdoor Tourism):** This involves activities in natural environments, like camping.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, manoranjak yaatriyon ki prathmikta kya ho sakti hai?","The correct answer is **B: Apni dinacharya se chhuttee lena** (Taking a break from their daily routine).

Here's why:

The passage states that recreational tourism happens ""when people go to places completely different from their daily lives for rest and fun."" This directly indicates that the priority of recreational tourists is to escape their routine and enjoy leisure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sthaneey sanskrti ka anand lena** (Enjoying the local culture) - This describes *cultural tourism*, not recreational tourism.
*   **C: Mahatvapoorn sthalon ko dekhna** (Seeing important places) - The passage doesn't specifically say recreational tourists focus on important places, just places for entertainment.
*   **D: kisi sthaan ke itihaas ko smjhna** (Understanding the history of a place) - This also describes *cultural tourism*.



"
Passage me kis cheez ka ullekh kiya gaya hai jisse sthaaneey church me parivartan ke dar ko kam krne mein madad milee?,"The correct answer is **A: Udyamasheel vyavhaar ke saphal udaaharanon ko yaad karna**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""is udaaharan mein, udyami vyavhaar ke pichle udaaharan ke yaadon aur safalataon ne, asthaaniya church ko naye badlaavon aur nirdeshon ke saath kholne mein logon ki madad ki. Aisi safalata ke kahaaniyon ne bhavishya mein badlav ki disha mein sakaratmak jhukav paida karte hue, badlav ke aashankaon ko kam kiya.""  This directly connects remembering successful entrepreneurial examples to reducing fear of change in the local church.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sangathan ki sanskriti ko prabhavit karne vale logon ke baare mein jankaari praapt karna:** While the passage *mentions* learning about people who influenced the organization's culture, it doesn't say this specifically reduced fear of change. It contributed to understanding the organization's history.
* **C: Sangathan chalane wali takton ki khoj karna:** The passage talks about understanding the ""prerak shakti"" (driving force) but doesn't say discovering these forces lessened change-related fears.
* **D: Sangathan ke itihas ko samjhna:**  Understanding the history is helpful, but the *specific* thing that reduced fear was recalling past successes. The passage states understanding history doesn’t equal understanding the culture, but helps people understand their place within it.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, apna itihaas samjhne se kya madad mil sakti hai?","The correct answer is **A: Parivartan ka dar kam hoga (Fear of change will decrease)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Aisi safalata ke kahaaniyon ne bhavishya mein badlav ki disha mein sakaratmak jhukav paida karte hue, badlav ke aashankaon ko kam kiya."" This translates to: ""Stories of success helped to create a positive inclination towards change in the future, reducing anxieties about change.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Moolyon ki vraddhi hogi (Values will increase):** While understanding history *can* reinforce values, the passage doesn't directly state this as a result. It focuses on understanding the driving forces *behind* the values.
*   **C: Sangathan ke bheetar sthaan bnane ki bhaavna paida hogi (A sense of belonging within the organization will be created):** The passage mentions understanding where one ""fits"" within the organization's history, but it doesn't equate this to a feeling of belonging.
*   **D: Udyamasheel vyavhaar mein sudhaar hoga (Entrepreneurial practice will improve):** The passage uses the example of a church, not a purely entrepreneurial context, and doesn't claim history directly improves entrepreneurial practices.



"
Inme se kaun sa kathan seekhane ke uttar aadhunik drishtikon ka sateek varnan karta hai?,"The most accurate answer based on the passage is **B: Aesi chizen sikhni chahiye jinse hmara vasta hota hai** (We should learn things that we encounter/relate to).

Here's why:

* **The passage heavily emphasizes learning through experience.** It argues that true learning comes from the interaction between the learner and the knowledge provider, and from *doing* things, not just passively observing.  The examples provided (fountains, ruins, home repair) all illustrate things people watch on TV but don't actually *do*.
* **The core message is that learning is most effective when it's applicable to your life.** The passage criticizes learning that doesn't translate into practical experience.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Seekhane ke kuch anubhav doosaron ki tulna mein adhik phaaydemand hote hain** (Some learning experiences are more beneficial than others): While true in general, the passage doesn't focus on *which* experiences are better, but rather on the necessity of *experiential* learning.
* **C: Seekhane ke kuchh tarike doosaron se behtar hote hai** (Some ways of learning are better than others): The passage doesn't prioritize one *method* of learning (like reading vs. watching). It prioritizes *doing* over *observing*, which isn't about the method itself, but the involvement of the learner.
* **D: Seekhne ki koi seema nhi hoti** (There is no limit to learning): The passage doesn't discuss the limits of learning, only its effectiveness.



Therefore, option B best captures the central argument of the passage – that learning is most valuable when it's connected to practical experience and what you actually encounter in life."
Inme se kaun sa kathan uttar aadhunik shikshan drishtikon ko sateek roop se pratibimbit nhi krta?,"The correct answer is **D: Jis gyan ko hum shaayad kabhi istemaal na kar saken, vah bhi seekhne laayak hai.**

Here's why:

The passage strongly argues *against* learning for the sake of learning. It emphasizes that true learning comes from *doing*, from experience, and from applying knowledge. It critiques television shows that present information without the opportunity for practical application, suggesting that such learning is ultimately useless.

Let's look at why the other options *do* reflect post-modern educational viewpoints presented in the passage:

*   **A: Seekhane ke kyi tarike hote hai (There are many ways to learn):** The passage implicitly acknowledges this by contrasting traditional, passive learning (like watching TV) with experiential learning.
*   **B: Seekhane ke kuch anubhavon ko doosaron ki tulana mein praathamikta di jani chahiye (Some learning experiences should be prioritized over others):** The passage clearly prioritizes *active*, *experiential* learning over passive observation.
*   **C: Seekhane ka anubhav seekhne vaale vyakti aur prastut samagri par nirbhar krta hai (The learning experience depends on the learner and the presented material):** The passage directly states learning happens through the interaction between the learner and the knowledge provider, and emphasizes the importance of *applying* the learned material.

Option D directly contradicts the central argument of the passage, which is that learning without application is pointless. Therefore, it doesn't accurately reflect the post-modern educational viewpoint described.



"
"Neend ki samanya avadhi ke dauraan jaanboojhkar jagne ke baad, inmen se kaun badha banega?","The correct answer is **B: Bathroom istemal krke fir se so jana**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""sone se pehle bahut saare taral padaarth peena (vishesh roop se paani yaa chay, ek prachalit mootravardhak) shamil hai, jisase vyakti ko mutra karne ke liye majboor hona padta hai.""  This means deliberately drinking fluids before bed to *force* yourself to wake up and go to the bathroom is a method to interrupt sleep.  Going to the bathroom and then going back to sleep directly follows this principle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dobaara sone se pahale dedh ghante tak padhna (Reading for an hour and a half before going back to sleep):** This would likely make you *more* sleepy, not interrupt sleep.
* **C: Alarm band karna aur bees minute baad phir se so jana (Turning off the alarm and falling asleep again 20 minutes later):** The passage suggests making it *difficult* to turn off the alarm, not simply turning it off and immediately falling back asleep.
* **D: Pani pine ke liye uthna (Getting up to drink water):** While getting up to drink water *could* wake you up, the passage describes this as a method to *cause* the waking up (by drinking a lot *before* bed), not as a consequence of already being awake.



"
Inme se kaun sa kathan neend rokne ke bare me shi nhi hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Lakshya yah hai ki jagne ke do ghante baad vaapas so jana hai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states sleep interruption is followed by a relatively short period (10-60 minutes) before falling back asleep.** It doesn't mention a two-hour gap.  The intention is to briefly wake up to reset and then quickly return to sleep.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Yah biorythem par aadharit ho sakta hai (It can be based on biorhythms):** The passage mentions ""biorad-aadhaarit vikalpon"" (biorhythm-based options) like drinking fluids before bed.
* **B: Puri tarah jagna maksad nhi hai (Fully waking up is not the goal):** The passage explicitly states it's about bringing you to consciousness *without fully waking up* using a gentle alarm.
* **C: Yah prakriya aapki neend ki samanya avadhi ke dauraan hoti hai (This process happens during your normal sleep duration):** The first sentence directly states this.



"
"Jaise-jaise dimag aur jyada spasht sapne dekhane ka prayaas karta hai, kya badhata hai?","The correct answer is **D: REM sthitiyon ke beech ka samay (The time between REM cycles)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that frequent lucid dreaming (which involves the brain trying to have these dreams) leads to fatigue because it **""vistaar karne waale suhavane sapanon ka parinam hai""** (extends the duration of REM cycles) and makes it similar to waking up every 20-30 minutes.  This directly means the *time between* REM cycles is being lengthened, disrupting normal restorative sleep.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: REM isthitiyon ki matra (Number of REM cycles):** The passage doesn’t say the number of REM cycles increases, but that they are *extended*.
*   **B: Urja stara (Energy levels):** The passage states lucid dreaming *decreases* energy levels, causing fatigue.
*   **C: Recovery sthiti ki avadhi (Duration of recovery state):**  The passage implies recovery is *hindered* by the extended REM cycles, not that the recovery period itself is lengthened.



"
Baar-baar spasht sapne dekhne se shareer par inme se kaun sa nakaratmak prabhaav pad sakta hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Har raat REM ki sankhya ghat jati hai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""har raat kam REM ke saath, wah avastha jismein aap vaastavik neend ka anubhav karte hain..."".  This directly translates to ""with less REM each night, the state in which you experience real sleep..."". The passage links frequent lucid dreaming to a decrease in the number of REM sleep cycles a person experiences each night.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: REM sthitiyon ke beech ki avadhi kam ho jati hai** - The passage states the *opposite* - lucid dreaming *extends* the time within REM cycles.
*   **C: Spasht svapn dekhne par nirbharta badh jati hai** - The passage doesn't mention addiction or dependence.
*   **D: Har raat REM ki sankhya badh jati hai** - This is the opposite of what the passage describes.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, paramparagat aur virtual team ek jaisee kaise hai?","The correct answer is **A: Dono team ek jaisa pradarshan karti hai** (Both teams perform the same).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Virtual teams ko bhi parmparagat teams ke tarah hi utkrishtata ke samaan manakon par rakhaa jaataa hai..."" which translates to ""Virtual teams are also held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage says virtual teams *have more* autonomy, not that it's different in daily routine.
* **C:** Only virtual teams have the concept of an ""invisible team"" that members report to. Traditional teams don't necessarily function this way.
* **D:** The passage specifically states virtual teams *may* operate across different time zones, implying they do *not* work in the same time zone.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Paramparagat aur virtual team ke sambandh me kaun sa kathan satya nhi hai?","The correct answer is **A: Paramparagat team ko aamtaur par behtar mana jata hai**

Here's why:

The passage states that virtual teams are held to the *same standards of excellence* as traditional teams (""Virtual teams ko bhi parmparagat teams ke tarah hi utkrishtata ke samaan manakon par rakhaa jaataa hai"").  It doesn't imply that traditional teams are considered better.  In fact, it points out some advantages of virtual teams (autonomy, working across time zones).

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

*   **B: Virtual team aksar paramparagat team ke liye sampark bindu ke roop mein karya karti hai** - This is directly stated in the passage (""Virtual team ke sadasya aksar apne taatkalik bhautik samooh ke liye sampark bindu ke taur par kam karte hain."")
*   **C: Paramparagat team mein virtual team ki tulana mein kam autonomy hoti hai** - The passage says virtual teams have *more* freedom (""unke paas parmparagat team sadasyon ke mukabale zyada azadi hoti hai"").
*   **D: Alag-alag samay kshetra se virtual team ko fayda ho sakta hai** - The passage explicitly mentions this as a feature (""unaki teemen alag-alag samay kshetron ke hisaabse mill sakti hain"").



"
Inme se kaun si aesi cheez nhi hai jis par Samagri ka siddhant kendrit hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Mature aadmi me nyi-nyi ikshayen utpanna hoti hai** (New desires are generated in a mature man).

Here's why:

The passage states that motivational theories focus on needs and desires that are **embedded within people as they mature** – meaning they *already exist* and are revealed with age, not newly created. It doesn't say that new desires *arise* in maturity.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

*   **B: Kisi ka vatavaran uske karyon ko kaise prabhaavit krta hai** (How someone's environment influences their actions) - The passage explicitly mentions how the environment dictates what people do or don't do.
*   **C: Aantarik aavashyakataen** (Internal needs) - The passage focuses on uncovering inherent needs and desires.
*   **D: Logo ki pasand ko samajhna** (Understanding people's preferences) - The passage begins by stating the theory is about discovering ""what makes people tick"" or ""what attracts them.""



"
Inme se kaun tisre niyam ka uddeshya nhi hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Photo vyavasthit karna (To organize the photo)**.

Here's why:

* **The Rule of Thirds** is about *composition* - where you *place* elements within a photo to create a more visually interesting and balanced image. It's not about simply making the photo ""organized"". While good composition *contributes* to organization, organization itself isn't the *purpose* of the rule.

Let's look at why the other options *are* related to the Rule of Thirds:

* **A: Vastu ko kha rakha ja sakta hai, iske liye ek aadhaar rekha banaana (Creating a baseline for where objects can be placed):** The grid created by the Rule of Thirds *provides* those baselines – the lines themselves.
* **B: Ek hi tasveer me jeevan aur urja dikhana (Showing life and energy in a single picture):** Placing key elements at the intersections or along the lines can create a dynamic and engaging image, conveying a sense of life and energy.
* **C: Vastu ko kisi khas aur prabhaavshali sthan par rakhna (Placing objects in a specific and impactful location):** This is the core of the Rule of Thirds - identifying the most visually compelling locations within the frame.



"
Inme se kaun 35 mm ke photography praaroop ko pradarshit nhi karta?,"The correct answer is **C: Kyi saamaanya praaroop ki tulana me, isme ek alag aspect ratio ka istemal kiya jata hai.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that many common formats (like APS) are *close to* or *around* the 3:2 aspect ratio inherited from the 35mm format.  This means 35mm *doesn't* have a drastically different aspect ratio than other common formats – it's the foundation for them.

Let's look at why the other options are correct statements about 35mm, according to the passage:

*   **A: Yah abhi bhi utpaadan mein hai** - The passage states ""yah aaj bhi banaaya jaataa hai"" (it is still produced).
*   **B: Ise digital camera praaroop me apnaya gya tha** - The passage states the 35mm format’s aspect ratio was inherited by digital camera image sensors.
*   **D: Yah duniya ke sabse aam praaroop hai** - The passage states “duniya mein sabse yaada istemal hone wala totograni format 35mm hai” (the most used photographic format in the world is 35mm).



"
"Passage ke hisab se, jaise-jaise nirmata lens utpaadan ki gunvatta badha rahe hai, zoom lens mein kaise sudhaar hua hai?","The correct answer is **C: Inki photo quality nishchit focal lenth vaale lens ke samaan hoti hai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Isane nishchit focal lambai waale lens se hassil tasveeron ke tulna mein jom lenses dwara uchch koti ke tasveeren hassil karna sambhav kiya hai.""  This translates to ""This has made it possible to obtain high-quality images with zoom lenses compared to images obtained with lenses of a fixed focal length.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Unme lens ki gati jyada hoti hai:** The passage actually says zoom lenses *typically have a lower maximum aperture (speed)*.
*   **B: Kam roshni me inka upayog karna aasaan hota hai:** The passage states low light use is *difficult* with cheaper zoom lenses.
*   **D: Prime lens ki tulna me inki focal jatilta kam hoti hai:** The passage says zoom lenses have *more* focal complexity than prime lenses.



"
"Passage me di gyi jankari ke hisab se, prime lens ki tulna me zoom lens kab behatar ho sakta hai?","The correct answer is **B: Agar apko lens me kam element chahiye** (If you want fewer elements in the lens).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Zoom lens ka dosh yah hai ki focal lambai ke ek seema ko praapt karne ke liye aavashyak focal jatilta aur lenses ke sankhya prime lens ke tulna mein bahut adhik hoti hai.""  This directly translates to ""The drawback of a zoom lens is that to achieve a range of focal lengths, it requires more focal complexity and *more lenses* compared to a prime lens.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Agar adhikatam uchch aperture (gati) prathmikta hai** (If maximum high aperture (speed) is a priority) - The passage states zoom lenses generally have *lower* maximum apertures.
* **C: Agar apko kam roshani me flash ka istemal na karna ho** (If you don't want to use flash in low light) - The passage says low light performance is *difficult* with cheaper zoom lenses due to their smaller apertures.
* **D: Agar apko jyada focal jatilta chahiye** (If you want more focal complexity) - This is actually a characteristic *of* zoom lenses, not a situation where a prime lens would be better.

Inme se kise rahasyavaad ka sateek varnan nhi maana jaega?,"The correct answer is **A: Chetna ki shantipurna aur aanandmay sthiti ka anubhav karne par jor diya gya hai** (Emphasis on experiencing a peaceful and blissful state of consciousness).

Here's why:

The passage states that mysticism *can* lead to peaceful, blissful, even ecstatic states, but that's a *result* of the core pursuit, not the definition of the pursuit itself. The core pursuit is about connecting with ultimate reality, God, or spiritual truth.

Let's break down why the other options *are* accurate descriptions of mysticism, based on the passage:

* **B: Rahasyavaad ke anuyayi aadhyatmik satya ke prati jagrukta chahte hai** (Mystics seek awareness of spiritual truth) -  The passage explicitly states mysticism is a ""koshish"" (effort) to understand spiritual truth.
* **C: Rahasyavaad ke anuyayi aesi prathaon ko apana sakte hai jo divya vastavikta mein unki antardrishti ko vikasit karne mein madad karengi** (Mystics may adopt practices that help develop their intuition in divine reality) - The passage says followers use certain methods to *experience* these realities.
* **D: Dharmik vishvas aur puja ke anya tarikon ke bjay, pratyaksha vyaktigat anubhav praapt karne par jor** (Emphasis on obtaining direct personal experience, rather than other ways of religious belief and worship) - This directly reflects the passage's statement about prioritizing *pratyaksh vyaktigat anubhav* (direct personal experience).

Therefore, option A is the only one that describes a *potential outcome* of mysticism rather than its defining characteristic."
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kaun sa rahasyavaad ka kendra bindu nhi hai?","Correct answer is **B: Sajha, samudayik anubhavon ke maadhyam se antardrishti praapt karna**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that mysticism emphasizes **direct personal experience** of consciousness – peaceful, practical, joyful, even ecstatic. It focuses on individual experiences of the divine, intuition, or insight. 

Option B, ""Sajha, samudayik anubhavon ke maadhyam se antardrishti praapt karna"" (Gaining insight through shared, communal experiences) contradicts this focus on *personal* and *direct* experience.  Mysticism, as described in the passage, isn't about collective experiences, but about individual awakening.

Let's look at why the other options *are* central to mysticism according to the passage:

*   **A: Divya vastavikta me antargyan ki talaash** (Searching for intuition in divine reality) - The passage mentions ""antargyaan"" (intuition) as a way to experience the divine.
*   **C: Chetna ki aanandmay sthiti par jor** (Emphasis on a blissful state of consciousness) -  The passage specifically describes mystical experiences as ""shantipurna, vyaavhaarik, anandit, yaa yahaan tak ki anandit charitra"" (peaceful, practical, joyful, even ecstatic).
*   **D: Ishwar ke prati sachet jagrukta hasil karna** (Gaining conscious awareness of God) - The passage defines mysticism as an effort to gain conscious awareness of God, spirituality, or ultimate reality.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, krishi samaaj ki shuruaat kisne ki hogi?","The correct answer is **C: Polynesia ke Maori logon ne** (The Maori people of Polynesia).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...it was long believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were Maori people who hunted the moa, a giant bird. The theory established that the Maori travelled in a great fleet from Polynesia and took New Zealand from the Moriori, establishing an agricultural society.""

This clearly indicates that the initial establishment of an agricultural society in New Zealand is attributed to the Maori people arriving from Polynesia.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: New Zealand ke Moriori ne** - The passage clarifies that the Moriori were *taken over* by the Maori, and weren't the ones who originally established the agricultural society.
*   **B: Chatham Islands ke Moriori ne** - The Moriori of the Chatham Islands developed *after* separating from the mainland Maori, and their culture was distinct. They didn't establish the initial agricultural society in New Zealand.
*   **D: Mainland ke Maori ne** - While the mainland Maori did establish an agricultural society, the passage states they came *from* Polynesia. So, Polynesia is the correct origin.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, moa ka shikaar karne vaala samooh pahle kha rahtaa tha?","The correct answer is **B: New Zealand**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Unnisvin aur beesavin shatabdi ke dauran lambe samay tak, yah maanaa jaataa tha ki newzealand ke pehle nivasi maori log the, **joe moss namak vishal pakshi ka shikar karte the.**""  This directly says the Māori people, who hunted the moa (moss), were the first inhabitants of *New Zealand*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: The Mainland:** While the text discusses a mainland group later becoming the Moriori, it doesn't say they *originally* hunted the moa there.
*   **C: The Chatham Islands:** The Moriori moved *to* the Chatham Islands, they didn’t begin hunting moa there.
*   **D: Polynesia:**  The passage states the Māori came *from* Polynesia, but doesn’t say they hunted moa *in* Polynesia.



"
Kis sthiti me origami ki pureland paddhati ka upayog karne se folder ko laabh hoga?,"The correct answer is **A: Jb folder ko ek saath kayi fold bnane ho**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Pureland origami is designed for people with limited motor skills or those new to origami.**  This implies it simplifies the folding process.
* **It specifically mentions it *doesn't* allow complex folds like reverse folds.** This eliminates option C.
* **The passage highlights it's for beginners or those with difficulty,** making options B and D incorrect.  They would *not* benefit from a simplified method.
* **Pureland origami's restriction to single folds and straight lines makes it easier to perform multiple folds in sequence.** This is the core benefit implied by the method's design.

Therefore, if a folder needs to make several folds quickly and easily, Pureland origami would be most helpful.



"
Inme se kaun sa kathan Pureland origami ke bare me shi nhi hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Ye sirf anubhavi folder ke liye hi hai (It is only for experienced folders)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Pureland origami was *developed to help inexperienced folders or those with limited motor skills*. Therefore, it's *not* only for experienced folders.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

* **B: Isme reverse fold shamil nhi hote (It doesn't include reverse folds)** - The passage says complex folds like reverse folds are not allowed.
* **C: Fold me seedhe sthaan hone jaruri hai (Straight angles are necessary in the folds)** - The passage explicitly states all folds have straight angles.
* **D: Seemit motor skill wale folder ke liye acha tarika hai (It's a good method for folders with limited motor skills)** - The passage states it was developed to help those with limited motor skills.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, kaun sa sthaan sindhu ghaatee sabhyata se sambandhit nhi hai?","The correct answer is **C: Purvottar Afghanistan ke sabhi kshetra**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Indus Valley Civilization included ""some areas of north-eastern Afghanistan"". It does *not* say it included *all* areas of north-eastern Afghanistan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Harappa** - The passage specifically mentions Harappa as the site of the first excavation that led to the civilization being called the Harappan civilization.
*   **B: Saraswati Nadee** - The passage mentions the debate about renaming it the ""Indus-Saraswati Civilization"" due to theories about it originally flourishing along the Saraswati River.
*   **D: Adhikansh aadunik Pakistan** - The passage explicitly states it included ""areas of modern Pakistan"".



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kiska ullekh kansya yug sabhyta ke sambhaavit naam ke roop me nhi kiya gya hai?","Correct answer is **C: Sindhu nadee sabhyata**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions these names:

*   **Sidhu ghatee sabhyata** (Sindhu Ghati Sabhyata - Indus Valley Civilization)
*   **Hadappa sabhyata** (Harappa Civilization)
*   **Sindhu-saraswati sabhyata** (Indus-Saraswati Civilization)

It states the civilization is *named* after the Indus River, but doesn't refer to it *as* ""Sindhu nadee sabhyata"" as a possible name for the civilization itself. It's a description of *why* it's called the Indus Valley Civilization.

Therefore, ""Sindhu nadee sabhyata"" is the option *not* presented as a possible name in the passage."
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kaun lambe samay tak labh deta hai?","Correct answer is **A: Anya logo ke sath mil-jul kar kaam karna**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ummid hai ki adhikansh log yah mahsoos karenge ki dusron ke saath milkar kam karna unka deerghakalik sabse achcha vikalp hai."" (It is hoped that most people will realize that working with others is their best long-term option.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Apne hiton ko prathmikta dena (Prioritizing your own interests):** The passage suggests that while selfishness exists, it's *less* beneficial in the long run than cooperation.
*   **C: Is baat par jor dena ki bahusankhyak ki tulna me alpasankhyak ko kya laabh hoga (Emphasizing what the minority will gain compared to the majority):** The passage focuses on the benefit of the *majority* achieving gains through cooperation, not on the minority.
*   **D: Yeh pahachanna ki laalach fayademand ho sakata hai (Recognizing that greed can be beneficial):** While the passage acknowledges greed exists, it frames it as a short-term gain that isn’t as good as collaboration.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, agar kisi ka dhyaan turant faayda paane par hai, to wo inmein se kis cheez ko prathmikta dega?","The correct answer is **D: Swarthta (Self-interest)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that when a majority will benefit, it's *more* profitable in the short term to act selfishly (swarthy bunker kam karne se alpaavadhi mein zyada laabh hoga) than to cooperate.  Someone focused on *immediate* gain will prioritize that short-term profit, and therefore, prioritize self-interest.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Niswarthta (Selflessness)** - The passage contrasts selflessness with self-interest, stating that self-interest is more profitable in the short term.
*   **B: Sath milkar kaam karna (Working together)** - The passage suggests cooperation is better in the *long* run, but not for immediate gains.
*   **C: Sahyog (Cooperation)** - Similar to 'working together', the passage implies cooperation is a longer-term strategy.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, war par hone wale kharcho ka sabse bada hissa kisne diya?","Correct answer: **D: Philippines ke logo ne**

The passage clearly states: ""Philippiens ke veejay mein American samrajyavad ke yuddh vyay ka bhugtan philipino ke logonne khud kiya tha."" (In the Philippines' victory, the people of the Philippines themselves paid for the war expenses of American imperialism.)

Therefore, the passage states the Filipino people bore the greatest burden of the war expenses.



"
Templars ke yug se pahle kaunsa samay kaal aaya tha?,"The correct answer is **C: Praarambhik madhya yug** (Early Middle Ages).

The passage states: ""Uchch madhya yug aarambhik madhya yugse pehle hua tha..."" which translates to ""The High Middle Ages came *before* the Early Middle Ages."" 

Therefore, the time period before the Templars' era (High Middle Ages) was the Early Middle Ages."
Templars ke yug ke baad kaunsa time period aaya tha?,"The correct answer is **A: Uttar madhya yug** (Late Middle Ages).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Uchch madhya yug...uske baad aadhunik madhya yug aaya jiska samaapan 1500 ke aspas maanaa jaataa hai.""  ""Aadhunik madhya yug"" translates to ""Late Middle Ages.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 12vin sadi** (12th century) - This is *within* the High Middle Ages, not *after* it.
* **C: Uchch madhya yug** (High Middle Ages) - This is the period being discussed, not what came after.
* **D: 11vin sadi** (11th century) - This is also *within* the High Middle Ages.



"
"Roman saamraajy ke dauraan, doctors aur surgeons ki taraf se istemaal kiye jaane waale kis chikitsa upchaar ya prakriya ke baare mein nahi bataya gaya hai?","The correct answer is **A: Dimag ko sukoon dene wali alag-alag dawaiyon se post-traumatic stress disorder ka ilaaj**.

Here's why:

The passage mentions:

* **B:** Scopolamine from henbane seeds was used.
* **C:** Tourniquets and arterial clamps were used to stop blood flow.
* **D:** Amputation was skillfully performed to save patients from gangrene.

However, the passage **does not mention** any treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder or specifically using different drugs to calm the mind after trauma.  While they had pain relief, the concept of specifically treating psychological trauma with medication is not discussed in the text.

Therefore, option A is the medical treatment or procedure *not* mentioned in the provided text.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, yahan batayi gayi kis cheez ko Roman samraajy ke dauraan chikitsa ke kshetr mein hui pragati ka shrey nahi diya jaata?","Sahi jawab hai **C: Shiksha ke hospitals banana**.

Passage mein bataya gaya hai ki:

*   **Medical Corps ka gathan** (Samrat Augustus ne pahali Roman medical core banwai) - A sahi hai.
*   **Raja ki taraf se ki gayi doctors ki bharti** (Samrat Augustus ne doctors ko bharti karna shuru kiya) - D sahi hai.
*   **Empire ki aakramak sainya neeti** (ladai ke baad upayog ke liye medical core banwai aur shalyachikitsakon ne dard mitaane waali aushadhiyon ka gyaan prapt kiya) - B sahi hai.

Par passage mein **shiksha ke hospitals banane** ka koi zikr nahi hai. Isliye, ye Roman samrajya ke dauraan chikitsa ke kshetr mein hui pragati ka shrey nahi diya jaata."
Dekhne ki kshamta kis cheez par nirbhar karti hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Visual system sensory organs par**.

Here's why:

The passage clearly states in the first sentence: ""Drishti yaa dekhne ki shamta visual system sensory organs yaa aankho par nirbhar karti hai."" (Vision or the ability to see depends on the visual system, sensory organs, or eyes).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Organism ki zarooraton par** - While the passage *mentions* organisms' needs influence the complexity of eye structures, it doesn't say sight *depends* on them.
* **C: Kuchh khaas tarah ki wave-lengths ke liye samvedansheel hone par** - This is a *characteristic* of different eye structures (mentioned later), not what sight fundamentally depends on.
* **D: Sahi se dekhne ke alag-alag level par** - This also describes a *result* of different eye structures, not the core dependency.



"
Organisms ke beech aankhon ka alag-alag structure kin cheezon se tay hota hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Organism ki zarooraton ke mautaabik** (According to the needs of the organism).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Aankho ke kayee vibhin rachanaaen hain, jo jeev ki zarooraton ke aadhar par jatilta mein hain."" (There are many different structures of eyes, which vary in complexity based on the needs of the organism.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Tarang savedanshilta (Wavelength sensitivity)** - While wavelength sensitivity *is* a characteristic of eye structure, the passage states it's a *result* of the structure, not the determining factor of *why* structures differ.
*   **C: Sahi se dikhai dene ke level se (Level of clear vision)** - Clear vision is an outcome of eye structure, not the reason for the structural differences.
*   **D: Organism ki complexity se (Organism's complexity)** -  The complexity of the organism doesn't directly dictate eye structure. A simple organism can have a complex eye adapted to its specific needs, and vice versa.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Sikh dharm ke baare mein batai gai inmein se kaunsi baat sahi nahi hai?","The correct answer is **B: Sikh dharm hi ek aisa dharm hai jismein guru ka fundamental pehlu hai.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""guru sabhi bhartiya dharmon ka ek moolbhoot pahlu hai, lekin sikh dharm mein iska itna adhik mahatva hai ki yah sikh maanyataon ka mool hai.""  This means *all* Indian religions have the concept of a guru, but it's particularly central to Sikhism.  Saying Sikhism is the *only* one with a fundamental guru aspect is inaccurate according to the text.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Hindu dharm ki andar hi sampradiyak algaav ki wajah se Sikh dharm udhra tha** - The passage states: ""yah 15vi shatabdi ke dauran punjab shetra mein hindu parmpara ke bhitar ek sampradayik vibhajan se utpann hua tha."" (It arose from a sectarian split within the Hindu tradition in the Punjab region in the 15th century.)
*   **C: Dharm ke sansthaapak Guru naanak ke baad nau guru hue** -  The passage states: ""Dharm ki asthapna 15 ween shatabdi mein Guru Nanak (1469-1539) ne ki thi. uske baad nau guru ek ke baad ek karke aye."" (The religion was founded by Guru Nanak in the 15th century. After him, nine gurus came one after another.)
*   **D: Sikh dharm ki kuchh paramparaein Hindu dharm par aadhaarit hain** - The passage states: ""Sikh apne vishwaas ko hindu dharm se alag maante hain, haalaanki way iski hindu jadon aur parmparon ko sweekar karte hain."" (Sikhs consider their faith separate from Hinduism, although they acknowledge its Hindu roots and traditions.)



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inmein se kis cheeez ko Sikh dharm ka mukhya pehlu mana jata hai?","The correct answer is **A: Guru ka concept**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sikh dharm mein iska [guru ka] itna adhik mahatva hai ki yah sikh maanyataon ka mool hai."" (In Sikhism, it is so important that it is the root of Sikh beliefs).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hindu paramparaein:** While the passage acknowledges Sikhism originated *within* Hindu tradition and *accepts* its roots, it doesn't state these traditions are the *main* aspect of the religion.
* **C: Bharat ke anya dharmon ko swikar karne se mana karna:** The passage doesn't mention anything about *refusing* to accept other religions.
* **D: Punjabi bhasha mein baat karna:** The passage mentions ""gurmat"" is a Punjabi word but doesn't claim speaking Punjabi is a central tenet of the faith.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Attention Deficit Disorder se joojh rahe bachchon ko kis cheez par focus karne mein mushkil ho sakti hai?","The correct answer is **A: School ke kaam mein** (School work).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""ADD wale bachchon ka mushkil samay hota hai schooly padhaai jaisi chizon par dhyan kendrit karna..."" (Children with ADD have difficulty focusing on things like school studies...). 

The passage *also* states they *can* focus on things they enjoy like games and cartoons, ruling out options B, C, and D.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, Attention Deficit Disorder se joojh rahe bachche zokhim bhare kaam kyun karte hain?","The correct answer is **D: Apne dimaag ko uksaane ke liye** (To stimulate their brain).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ye bachche bahut pareshani mein padtein hain, kyonki ye apne dimag ko uttejit karne ke liye jokhim bharey kam karte hain...""  This directly translates to ""These children get into a lot of trouble because they do risky things to stimulate their brains...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hyperactivity ko kam karne ke liye** (To reduce hyperactivity) - The passage states they *seek* stimulation, not reduce hyperactivity through risky behavior.
* **B: Apni umr ke bachchon se judne ke liye** (To connect with children their age) - The passage focuses on the internal neurological need for stimulation, not social connection.
* **C: Apne parents ka dhyaan khinchne ke liye** (To get their parents' attention) - While attention-seeking *could* be a behavior, the passage specifically links risky behavior to the need to stimulate the brain.



"
"Passage mein di gayi jaankaari ke aadhaar par, inmein se kis tarike se scaffolding nahi ki jati?","The correct answer is **C: Ek alag study program (A separate study program)**.

Here's why:

The passage defines scaffolding as *support* given to someone learning something new. It explicitly mentions examples like teachers and the Microsoft Office Paperclip, which *guide* the learner.  It highlights that scaffolding helps with processes challenging for the learner to handle *alone*.

Let's look at why the other options ARE scaffolding:

* **A: Computer game ki shuruaat mein ek tutorial (A tutorial at the beginning of a computer game):** Tutorials guide you through the initial steps, providing support until you understand the basics. This is a clear example of scaffolding.
* **B: Ek SAT tutor (An SAT tutor):** A tutor provides personalized guidance and support to help you improve your skills and knowledge for the SAT, helping you overcome challenges.
* **D: Kisi chhoti league ka coach (A coach of a minor league):** A coach teaches fundamental skills and strategies, offering support and guidance as players learn and develop.

A separate study program (C) simply *provides material* to learn. It doesn't inherently offer the *dynamic, supportive, and guiding* assistance that defines scaffolding. You are left to navigate the program and challenges on your own.  While helpful, it isn’t scaffolding *itself*.



"
"Inmein se kaunsi baat, scaffolding ke concept ke baare mein sahi jaankari nahi de rahi?","Correct answer is **C: Ise project based learning bhi kaha jata hai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage clearly states:** ""Jabki project aadhaarit learning ko, learning ko aur aasaan aur adhik dilchasp banana chaahiye, scaffolding isase bhi ek kadam aage jaati hai."" (While project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.)  This directly implies scaffolding is *different* from project-based learning, not the same thing.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Scaffolds, virtually ho sakte hain:** The passage explicitly says, ""Scaffold virtual bhi ho sakte hain aur asli bhi..."" (Scaffolds can be virtual as well as real...)
* **B: Yeh madad ki bajaaye, seekhne ka tariqa zyada hai:** The passage states scaffolding *helps* people learning new things (""aise logon ko madadgaar hoti hai""). It's not just a method of learning itself, but support *during* learning.
* **D: Padhai ki shuruaat mein madad karnne ke liye, scaffolds ka istemaal kiya jata hai:** The passage implies this by saying scaffolding assists with challenging tasks (""chhaatr ke liye akele sambhaalne mein chunauti bhari hoti hain"").  Starting points are often challenging!



"
"Passage ke hisab se, MySpace ke kis feature se un students ko fayda ho sakta hai jinhein padhne mein pareshani hoti hai?","The correct answer is **A: Anukoolan (Customization)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ise padhne mein aasaan banaane ke liye anukoolit kiya jaa sakta hai aur wo bhi vaanchhit jitne yaa thode rang ke saath.""  This translates to: ""It can be customized to make it easier to read, and also with as many or as few colors as desired.""

This directly relates to helping students who have difficulty reading by making the page more accessible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Blogs:** Blogs are a feature, but the passage doesn't link them to helping students with reading difficulties.
* **C: One web address:** While convenient, a single web address doesn't directly address reading problems.
* **D: 5.4 crore profiles:** The number of profiles is a statistic about popularity, not a feature that aids reading.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, karmchariyon ke dange ke dauran, Krushchev ne inmein se kaunsi pratikriya nahi di thi?","Sahi jawab hai **C: Wage mein katauti badha di**.

Passage mein bataya gaya hai ki karmchariyon ne ""bhojan ki kami aur mazdoori mein katauti"" ka virodh kiya tha, lekin ismein yeh nahi kaha gaya ki Krushchev ne wage mein katauti badha di. Balki, passage mein bataya gaya hai ki unhone kuch aarthik maange poori ki aur Gomulka ko prime minister banaya. Tanks ka istemaal bhi passage mein zikr hai.

Isliye, **C** vah pratikriya hai jo Krushchev ne dange ke dauran nahi di thi."
Inmein se kis wajah se Poland mein dange nahi hue the?,"The correct answer is **D: Wladyslaw Gomulka ki niyukti se**.

Here's why:

The passage states that *after* the unrest, Khrushchev agreed to appoint the well-known figure Vladislav Gomulka as the new Prime Minister. This appeased some of the protesters and likely de-escalated the situation. While food shortages and wage cuts *caused* the initial protests, Gomulka's appointment is what led to the end of the unrest.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Saamyavaad:** The protests were *against* communism, so it's not a reason the riots didn't continue.
*   **B: Khaane ki kami:** Food shortages were a *cause* of the protests, not a reason they stopped.
*   **C: Vetan mein katauti:** Wage cuts were also a *cause* of the protests, not a reason they stopped.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inmein kis cheez ne USSR aur USA ke sambandhon par asar nahi dala tha?","The correct answer is **B: Germany ke baare mein raay** (Opinions about Germany).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that USSR and USA *cooperated* because of a *common enemy* in Germany during WWII. This means their opinions about Germany initially *brought them together*, not caused a rift. Once Germany was defeated, the passage details how differences in ""systems, processes, and cultures"" led to conflict and the Cold War.

Let's look at why the other options are correct influences:

*   **A: Saanskrtik antar** (Cultural differences) - The passage directly mentions ""cultures ke takraavon"" as a cause of the breakdown.
*   **C: Virodhabhasi prakriyaein** (Conflicting processes) - The passage states ""prakriya ke takraavon"" contributed to the issues.
*   **D: Systems ko lekar vivaad** (Disputes over systems) - The passage specifically mentions ""system ke takraavon"" as a reason for the breakdown of the alliance.

Therefore, opinions about Germany were not a factor in the deteriorating relationship; in fact, it was the opposite."
"Inmein se kaunsi cheez, poori body mein nerve impulse bhejne ke maksad ke baare mein sahi jankari nahi de rahi?","The correct answer is **A: Blood flow dheema hona**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tantrika tantra shareer ke madhyam se tantrika aavegon ko bhej kar homeostasis ko banaaye rakhta hai taaki pravaah ke saath-saath rakt abaadhit bhi banaa rahe.""  This means the nervous system works *with* blood flow, not to slow it down.  It needs good blood flow to deliver oxygen and nutrients, and to remove waste.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

* **B: Blood flow manage karna:** The passage mentions blood flow (""pravaah"") and its regulation (""abaadhit"").
* **C: Homeostasis banaye rakhna:**  The passage explicitly states the nervous system maintains homeostasis (""homeostasis ko banaaye rakhta hai"").
* **D: Body ke sambhaavit khatron se bacahna:** The passage says nerve impulses protect the body from danger (""shareer ko kisi bhi hone waale khatare se surakshit rakhne mein madad karta hai"").

Therefore, the only option that contradicts or misrepresents the information in the passage is slowing down blood flow.



"
Giza Plateau mein kya milta hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Makbare (Tombs)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Geeza pathar, """"geezaa necropolis"""" yaa mritakon ke misra ki ghaati mein kayee pyramid (jinmein se the great pyramid sabse bada hai), **kayee chhoti kabrein**..."" which translates to ""On the Giza plateau, """"Giza necropolis"""" or the valley of the dead, there are many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), **many small tombs**..."". 

While temples and the Great Pyramid are *also* present, the passage specifically highlights the presence of *many* tombs in the Giza necropolis.  ""Saaton ajoobe"" is incorrect as the passage states the Great Pyramid is the *only* remaining wonder.



"
Great Pyramid banane ka kya maksad tha?,"The correct answer is **B: Ferro ka Sammaan mein (In honor of Ferro)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Mahaan pyramid ferro khufu ke sammaan mein banaaya gaya tha"" (The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Saat ajubon mein se ek banane ke liye (To be one of the seven wonders)** - While the passage mentions it *is* one of the seven wonders, that's a *result* of its construction, not the *reason* for it.
*   **C: landmark banae ke liye (To create a landmark)** -  It became a landmark, but the primary purpose wasn't just to be a landmark.
*   **D: Jin logon ka nidhan hua hai wahan unki kabr banane ke liye (To build a tomb for those who have passed away)** - While it *is* a tomb, it was specifically for Pharaoh Khufu, not just anyone who had died.



"
Artemis ke mandir ko nasht karne mein kiska hath tha?,"The correct answer is **A: Ephesians**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ephisus mein artemis ke mandir ko 21 july, 356 eesa poorva ko **estostus dwara aagajani mein nasht kar diya gaya tha**."" While Herostratus *carried out* the act, he was an Ephesian (a resident of Ephesus). The passage implies the Ephesians were the source of the destruction, even if through one individual.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Alexander:** Alexander offered to rebuild the temple, he didn't destroy it.
*   **C: Strabo:** Strabo was a historian who *recorded* Herostratus's name, he didn't destroy the temple.
*   **D: Artemis:** Artemis was the goddess the temple was dedicated to; she wouldn't destroy her own temple."
Artemis ke mandir ko punar nirmaan ke baare mein konsa kathan sahi hai?,"सही उत्तर है **B: Alexander ke saashan ke baad mandir ka punar nirmaan hua**

टेक्स्ट में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि ""बाद में, अलेक्जेंडर की मृत्यु हो गई और 323 ईसा पूर्व में मंदिर का पुनर्निर्माण हुआ था।"" यह इंगित करता है कि पुनर्निर्माण अलेक्जेंडर के शासनकाल के बाद हुआ।

अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि:

*   **A:** टेक्स्ट में यह उल्लेख है कि अलेक्जेंडर ने मंदिर को फिर से बनाने का प्रस्ताव दिया था, लेकिन इसे अस्वीकार कर दिया गया था।
*   **C:** टेक्स्ट में हेरोस्ट्रैटस को पुनर्निर्माण लागत का भुगतान करने का कोई उल्लेख नहीं है।
*   **D:** टेक्स्ट में 323 ईसा पूर्व में पुनर्निर्माण की बात कही गई है, न कि 320 ईसा पूर्व में।"
Passage ke hisab se sabse pehle kab kisi prajati ne do pairon par chalna shuru kiya?,"The correct answer is **A: 7 million varsh pehle**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ho sakta hai 7 million varsh pahle se *sahenthropus* do pairon par chal sakta tha."" (It is possible that *Sahelanthropus* could walk on two legs from 7 million years ago). 

While bipedal features are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, the passage suggests the possibility of bipedalism *even earlier* with *Sahelanthropus*. Therefore, 7 million years ago is the earliest time mentioned when a species might have started walking on two legs.



"
Inme se konsi prajati niyamit roop se apne pairon par chalti thi?,"The correct answer is **B: Homo Erectus**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Pehla gyaat parivahan paidal chalna tha, insaanon ne **homo erects** (yaani upright mein) ke udbhav ke saath bees lakh saal pehle paidal chalane ke shuruat ke thi.""  This directly translates to: ""The first known means of transportation was walking, humans began walking with the emergence of **Homo Erectus** about two million years ago.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sahelanthropus:** The passage mentions *Sahelanthropus* may have walked on two legs as far back as 7 million years ago, but doesn't say they did so *regularly*.
* **C: Bipedal visheshagyat:** This refers to the *characteristic* of walking on two legs, not a specific species.
* **D: Australopithecus:** The passage says *Australopithecus* didn't habitually walk upright, though fossil evidence suggests they *had* bipedal characteristics.



"
German nausena dusre vishva yuddh ke dauran kya karna chahti thi?,"The correct answer is **A: Britain se aane wale saamaan ko rokna**.

The text states: ""...German nausena mukhya roop se U-boat ka istemal karte hue is traffic ko rokne ke koshish kar rahi thi."" (""...the German navy, mainly using U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic."")

This ""traffic"" refers to the American effort to transfer soldiers and materials to Britain. Therefore, the German navy aimed to stop goods *from* reaching Britain.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Britain ko saamaan aur logon ko paane se rokna** - This is too broad. They were specifically trying to *stop* things *reaching* Britain, not just prevent Britain from getting anything.
* **C: Pure Atlantic mein saamaan transport karna** - The text states they were trying to *stop* transport.
* **D: America ko saamaan aur logon ko paane se rokna** - They were targeting the flow of goods *to* Britain, not preventing America from sending them.



"
"Passage mein di gayi jankaari ke hisab se, uttari atlantic abhiyan ke dauran kise nausena yudh mein sabse jada safalta mili?","सही जवाब है **B: German**

व्याख्या:

पैसेज में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि जर्मन नौसेना, मुख्य रूप से U-boat का इस्तेमाल करते हुए, अटलांटिक महासागर में मित्र देशों के ट्रैफिक को रोकने की कोशिश कर रही थी। हालांकि पैसेज यह नहीं बताता कि कौन जीता, यह जर्मनों की सक्रिय भूमिका और उनकी रणनीति पर जोर देता है। अगर मित्र राष्ट्र विफल हो जाते, तो जर्मनी ब्रिटेन को हरा देता, यह जर्मन नौसेना की सफलता को दर्शाता है।

अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि:

*   **A: British और Americans:** पैसेज बताता है कि वे सामग्री और सैनिकों को स्थानांतरित करने की कोशिश कर रहे थे, लेकिन यह उनकी सफलता के बारे में नहीं कहता।
*   **C: German और British:** पैसेज ब्रिटिश की सफलता के बारे में कुछ नहीं बताता है।
*   **D: British:** पैसेज में ब्रिटिश की सफलता का कोई उल्लेख नहीं है।

"
Assyrians ne jab ghudsavaari shuru ki thi tab konsi cheez majud nhi thi?,"The correct answer is **A: Kathi** (Saddle).

The passage explicitly states: ""kathi ka aavishkar nahin hua tha, isliye assyrian ghudsavaar apne ghodon ke nangi peeth par baith kar ladey."" This translates to ""The saddle had not been invented, so the Assyrian cavalry fought sitting on the bare backs of their horses.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Crossbow:** The passage mentions Assyrians using a ""ghatak crossbow"" (deadly crossbow).
*   **C: Rath:** The passage states teeli waale pahiyon ke aavishkar ne rathon ko halka, tez aur behtar tareeke se taiyar banaa diya (the invention of spoked wheels made chariots lighter, faster, and better).
*   **D: Kavach:** The passage mentions crossbow bolts being able to pierce enemy ""kavach"" (armor).



"
Ghudsavaari ka istemal karne wali ladaiyan kaise ladi jati hain?,"The correct answer is **C: Ghodon ke peeth par baith kar**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ghudsavaar sena, ek aisi sena hai jo ghode par baithkar ladtee hai."" (Cavalry is an army that fights while riding on horses.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pairon par (On foot):** This is the opposite of what cavalry does.
*   **B: Bina kavach ke (Without armor):** The passage mentions Assyrian cavalry *didn't* have saddles, not that they lacked armor.
*   **D: Kam sainikon ke sath (With fewer soldiers):** The passage doesn’t say anything about the number of soldiers.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, apko ak ausat Babylon ka nivaasi kahan nhi milega?","The correct answer is **D: Aantarik garbhagrih mein bali lane ke liye**.

Here's why:

The passage states that only priests were allowed to enter the inner sanctum (garbhagrih). Therefore, a typical Babylonian resident would **not** be found offering sacrifices in the inner sanctum.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mandir ke praangan mein bali lane ke liye:** The passage mentions people offered sacrifices *to* the gods, implying they would be in the open courtyard.
*   **B: Mukhya mandir ke aayojano mein:**  The passage states priests dedicated their time to serving the gods through arrangements and festivals. Regular residents would also participate in these arrangements and festivals.
*   **C: Mandir ke praangan mein hone wale tyauhaaron mein:** Like option B, the passage implies residents would participate in festivals in the courtyard.



"
Inme se khas taur par pujariyon ke liye kya tha?,"सही जवाब है **B: आन्तरिक गर्भगृह**।

यहाँ कारण दिए गए हैं:

पाठ स्पष्ट रूप से बताता है कि ""केवल पुजारी ही आन्तरिक गर्भगृह में प्रवेश कर सकते थे।"" अन्य विकल्प (त्यौहार, आयोजन, और ज़िगगुराट्स) सभी में पुजारी शामिल थे, लेकिन वे पुजारी के लिए विशिष्ट नहीं थे - हर कोई त्यौहारों और आयोजनों में भाग ले सकता था और ज़िगगुराट्स मंदिर का एक हिस्सा थे, जहाँ सभी जा सकते थे।"
Raja Tutankhaman ko kab prasiddhi mili?,"The correct answer is **C: Unki kabr milne ke baad** (After his tomb was found).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Haalaanki, 1922 mein unki kabr ke khojne unhein ek charchit vyakti banaa diya."" (However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a famous person.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Unki kabr ki loot ke baad** (After his tomb was looted) - The passage specifically mentions the tomb *wasn't* looted.
* **B: Unke saashankal ke dauran** (During his reign) - The passage states he wasn't considered very important *during* his time.
* **D: Prachin raajaon ke soochi mein naam darj hone ke baad** (After his name was listed in the list of ancient kings) - He wasn't listed in ancient king lists.



"
Kis cheez ki wajah se Raja Tutankhama misra ke prasiddh raajaon mein se ek bane?,"The correct answer is **A: Binaa kisi chhedchhad ke mili unki kabr** (His tomb found without any disturbance).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Haalaanki, 1922 mein unki kabr ke khojne unhein ek charchit vyakti banaa diya."" (However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a famous person.) It also highlights that the tomb was *unlooted*, which is why so many valuable artifacts were preserved, contributing to his fame.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Prachin raajaon ke soochi mein naam** (Name in the list of ancient kings) - The passage says he *wasn't* listed among important ancient kings in ancient times.
* **C: Unki kabr se hazaron kalakritiyon ki loot** (Loot of thousands of artworks from his tomb) - The tomb was *not* looted; it was found intact.
* **D: Prachin misra kaal ke dauran unka mahatv** (His importance during ancient Egyptian times) - The passage states he wasn't considered very important *during* ancient times.



"
Greece ke kavi Homer kya nhi kar sakte the?,"The correct answer is **B: Andhe the**.

The passage explicitly states: ""संभावतः इस संस्कृति के सबसे प्रसिद्ध व्यक्ति होमर, महान अंधे कवि हैं"" which translates to ""Perhaps the most famous person of this culture is Homer, the great blind poet.""

Therefore, Homer *was* blind, meaning he could not see. The question asks what Homer *could not* do.
"
Greece ka konsa prasidh vyakti saahitya ke alawa kisi anya cheez ke liye jana jata tha?,"सही उत्तर है **C: Pythagorus**.

यहाँ कारण बताया गया है:

* **P में दी गई जानकारी के अनुसार:** पायथागोरस एक गणितज्ञ थे जिन्हें समकोण त्रिभुज के भुजाओं पर आधारित प्रमेय के लिए जाना जाता था। यह साहित्य से अलग एक क्षेत्र है।
* **अन्य विकल्प:**
    * **Homer, Sophocles, और Aristophanes** सभी लेखक/कवि/नाटककार थे, इसलिए उन्हें साहित्य के अलावा किसी और चीज के लिए नहीं जाना जाता।

इसलिए, पायथागोरस ही वह प्रसिद्ध व्यक्ति है जो साहित्य के अलावा किसी अन्य चीज के लिए जाना जाता था।"
Hibru parivar apna adhikansh jeevan kahan bitate the?,"The correct answer is **A: Khuli hawa mein** (In the open air).

The passage explicitly states: ""Hibru parivar ka adhikansh jeevan khuli hawa mein bitaa."" (The Hebrew family spent most of their lives in the open air.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sadak par** (On the road) - While stores had open counters on the road, the family didn't *live* there.
* **C: Aangan mein** (In the courtyard) - Women cooked in the courtyard, but the family life wasn't *confined* to the courtyard.
* **D: Ghar mein** (In the house) - The passage actually states houses weren't as necessary due to the warm climate, and they spent most of their lives *outside* of houses.



"
Hibru parivar ke liye kya jayad zaruri nhi tha?,"The correct answer is **C: Unke ghar** (Their houses).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Madhyapoorv ke garm jalvaayu mein **ghar utna zaruri nahin tha**."" (In the hot climate of the Middle East, **houses were not so necessary**.)

The question asks what was *not* very necessary for Hebrew families. The passage directly answers that it was houses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jalvaayu (Climate):** The climate *is* mentioned, but the passage says houses were not necessary *because of* the climate. The climate itself wasn't unnecessary.
*   **B: Unke store (Their stores):** The passage mentions stores, but doesn't say they weren't necessary.
*   **D: Khana (Food):** Food is obviously essential; the passage says women cooked.



"
Inme se kise scandinavian deshon ke bich antar ke rup mein nhi btaya gaya?,"सही उत्तर है **B: ज़मीन**

पैराग्राफ में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि डेनमार्क, स्वीडन, नॉर्वे और आइसलैंड के लोगों, राजाओं, रीति-रिवाजों और इतिहास के बीच अंतर थे। ज़मीन (भूमि) का उल्लेख इन अंतरों के रूप में नहीं किया गया है।

इसलिए, विकल्प B सही है।"
Greenland ko sabse pehle kisne basaaya tha?,"The correct answer is **A: Eskimo janjaati**.

The passage explicitly states: ""eskimo janjaati us samay pahle se hi vahan rah rahi thi"" (the Eskimo tribe was already living there at that time).

While Erik the Red later explored and named Greenland, and Scandinavians settled there, the passage emphasizes that the Eskimo people were the *first* inhabitants."
Konsa group kursiyon par baithkar khana nhi khaata?,"The correct answer is **C: Roman ke ameer admi** (Roman rich men).

Here's why:

The passage states, ""जहाँ गरीब लोग और महिलाएँ कुर्सीयों पर बैठकर खाना खाते थे, वहीं अमीर लोग मिलजुल कर दावतें करना पसंद करते थे और भोजन करते वक़्त व़ाय मौज मस्ती करते थे।"" (Where poor people and women preferred to eat sitting on chairs, the rich preferred to give feasts together and enjoyed themselves while eating.)

This directly indicates that rich Romans did *not* eat sitting on chairs; they preferred feasts and socializing during meals."
Inme se konsi cheez prachin roman bhojan ka hissa nhi thi?,"The correct answer is **D: Bhuni hui Turkey ki thali**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""unke paas naa toh makai thi, na hi tamatar, aloo, aur cocoa tha aur kisi bhi prachin Rome vaasi ne kabhi bhi Turkey nahin chakhaa tha."" (They did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted Turkey.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gareeb mehmanon ka kursi par baith kar khana** - The passage states that poor people *did* eat sitting on chairs.
*   **B: Khane mein ghonghe parosana** - The passage lists snails as one of the unusual foods Romans enjoyed.
*   **C: Ameer aadmi raat ke khane ke dauran lete rehte hain** - The passage mentions that wealthy Romans preferred to dine together and enjoy themselves during meals, which implies a leisurely, reclining manner.



"
Passage ke hisab se inme se kiska asar lambe samay tak padne ki sambhavna nhi hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Chhoti sanskritiya**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Chhoti sanskritiyan binaa beyne aitihaasik sabooton ke khatm ho jaati hain aur unhein sabhyata ka darja nahin mill paataa.""  This directly means small cultures are likely to disappear without leaving significant historical evidence, and therefore won't have a lasting impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Samaj (Society):**  The passage defines civilization *as* a society working together.  So, society is fundamental and has a lasting impact.
* **C: Shahar-rajya (City-states):** The passage states city-states are the foundation of nations, implying a continued influence.
* **D: Sabhyataagat sanskriti (Civilizational Culture):** This is the very subject of the passage and is described as having a lasting impact over many generations (""kayee peedhiyon mein gyaan ka paarit hona"").



"
Passage ke hisab se rashtra se pehle kya hota hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Shahar-rajya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shahar-rajya rashtron ke agua hain."" (City-states are the predecessors of nations.) This directly indicates that city-states existed *before* nations (rashtra).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sabhyataagat sanskriti** - While important, the passage doesn't say this comes *before* nations.
*   **B: Ek bade samooh mein saanjha ki jane wali sabhyata** - This *describes* a civilization, it doesn't indicate its temporal relationship to nations.
*   **D: Chhoti sanskritiyan** - The passage says these *disappear* without historical proof, they aren't precursors to nations.



"
Drukgyal Dzong ke bare mein konsa kathan sahi nhi hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Tibbati-Mangol sena ki jeet ke jashan manane ke liye banaya gaya tha.**

Here's why:

The passage clearly states that Drukgyal Dzong was built by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel *to commemorate his victory *against* the Tibetan-Mongol armies, not to celebrate the victory *of* the Tibetan-Mongol armies.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **B: yah Bhutaan mein hai** - The passage mentions Paro, which is in Bhutan.
*   **C: Aag ne kille ke kai avasheshon ko khatam kar diya** - The text says the fire left only a few remnants, like the portrait of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.
*   **D: Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel ne banavaaya tha** - The passage specifically states he built the fort in 1649."
Konsa kathan Drukgyal Dzong mein aag ke parinam ke bare mein sahi batata hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal ke chitra ka ak matra avashesh** (Only remnants of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal's portrait).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""1951 mein, aug ke karan drukgyal ongon ke kewal kuch hi avashesh bache, jaise ki Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel ka chitra.""  This translates to ""In 1951, due to fire, only a few remnants of Drukgyal Dzong remained, such as the portrait of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tibbati-mangol senaaon ki jeet** (Victory of Tibetan-Mongol armies) - The passage states the Dzong was *built* to commemorate a victory *against* them.
*   **C: Kille ki lokpriyata par koi asar nhi padha** (No effect on the castle's popularity) - The passage states it remains a ""shandar aakarshak jagah"" *after* being preserved, implying it was significantly affected and then restored.
*   **D: Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel ne surakshit rakha** (Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel protected it) - He *commissioned* its construction, but the passage says it was protected *after* the fire.



"
Inme se konsa kathan kambodiya ke bare mein sahi hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Thaai logon ne Phnom Phen ko nashta kar diya**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Thaai logonne 18ween sadi mein kayee baar kambodiya par hamla kiya aur saal 1772 mein Phnom Phen ko nashta kar diya."" (Thai people attacked Cambodia many times in the 18th century and destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Viyatnamiyon ne Phnom Phen ko nashta kar diya** - The passage says Vietnamese *attacked* Cambodia, but doesn't say they destroyed Phnom Penh.
*   **B: Kambodiya ne 1772 mein Thailand par hamla kiya** - The passage states Thailand attacked Cambodia, not the other way around.
*   **C: 18ween sadi ki shuruat mein Viyatnamiyon ne Kambodiya par bhi aakraman kiya** - The passage states Vietnamese attacks happened in the *later* years of the 18th century, not the beginning.



"
Inme se konsa kathan Kambodiya par aakramanon ka sahi varnan karta hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Thaai logon ne Kambodiya par kai baar aakraman kiya**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Thaai logonne 18ween sadi mein kayee baar kambodiya par hamla kiya"" (Thai people attacked Cambodia many times in the 18th century).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Viyatnamiyon ne Kambodiya par kai baar aakraman kiya** - While the passage mentions Vietnamese attacks, it doesn't say they happened *many* times.
*   **B: Thaai aur Viyatnamiyon ne Kambodiya par 1772 mein aakraman kiya** - Only the Thai attack and the destruction of Phnom Penh in 1772 are specifically mentioned. Vietnamese attacks are mentioned later in the 18th century, not necessarily in 1772.
*   **C: Viyatnamiyon ne Phnom Phen ko nashta kar diya** - The passage states the *Thai* people destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772, not the Vietnamese.



"
Ditch east india company ne taiwan mein apne samay ke dauran inme se kya kiya?,"Correct answer: **A, B, and C**

The passage explicitly states that the Dutch East India Company:

*   **A: Dakshin-paschimi taiwan mein ek base ki asthapna ki** (established a base in southwestern Taiwan)
*   **B: Adivasi anaaj utpaadan ke tariko mein parivartan ki shuruat kar rahi thi** (began changing indigenous agricultural practices)
*   **C: chini majdooron ko apne chawal aur chini baganon par kam karne ke liye niyukt kar rahi thi** (employed Chinese laborers on their rice and sugar plantations)

Option **D** is incorrect because the passage states that the Dutch East India Company did *not* hand control of Taiwan to the Qing dynasty. It was the Qing dynasty that seized control from the Dutch.



"
Shimonoseki ki sandhi ne kya kiya?,"The correct answer is **D: Taiwan par Japan ka adhikar** (Japan's control over Taiwan).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...jiske dwara wah taiwan ki samprabhuta japan ko saunp deti hai, jo 1945 tak dweep par raja karta hai."" This directly translates to ""...by which it surrendered Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, who ruled the island until 1945.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pratham Chin-japan yuddh mein Japan ki haar** (Japan's defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War) - The treaty was a *result* of the war, not the defeat itself.
*   **B: Ching rajvanshn ne Taiwan ko samrajya ka praant ghoshit kiya** (The Qing dynasty declared Taiwan a province of the empire) - This happened in 1885, *before* the treaty.
*   **C: Taiwan ki apne paschimi aur uttari tateey kshetron par control wapas lene ki koshish** (Taiwan's attempt to regain control over its western and northern coastal areas) - The treaty resulted in a *loss* of control, not an attempt to regain it.



"
Kisi rasayan ka ph star kaise maapa jata hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Chemical mein Hydrogen aayan ki matra** (The amount of hydrogen ions in the chemical).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""pH... is based on the concentration of hydrogen ions (protons)."" 
* **pH measures acidity/alkalinity:** The passage explains that pH changes color in red cabbage juice based on whether a substance is acidic or alkaline, and that pH is linked to the concentration of hydrogen ions.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A:** While pH *indicates* how acidic or alkaline a chemical is, it doesn't *measure* that directly – it measures the hydrogen ion concentration.
    * **B:** The *total* number of protons in a chemical isn't what determines pH. It's the *free* hydrogen ions.
    * **D:** The number of electrons doesn't directly determine pH.  It's the concentration of positively charged hydrogen ions that matters.



"
Hydrogen aayan se kya hataya gaya hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Electrons**.

The passage states: ""Hydrogen aayan way protons hain jinake electronsne unhein hataa diya (kyonki hydrogen atom ek proton aur ek electron se mill kar banaa hota hai).""  This directly translates to ""Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (because a hydrogen atom is made up of a proton and an electron).""

Therefore, the thing removed from a hydrogen ion is electrons."
Inme se konsa kathan Share pride ka satik varnan nahi karta?,"The correct answer is **B: Ner-Maadaaen anupat nhi hain**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Sheron ka samooh vayask ner ke saath-saath teesse zyada maadaa aur shavakon ke saath ekse teen tak ka banaa hota hai."" This translates to ""A lion pride consists of adult males along with *three times more females* and their cubs, ranging from one to three."" This *clearly* indicates an imbalanced ratio of males to females - more females than males.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Kafee hadd tak kutton ke tarah vyavhaar karte hain** - The passage states they function ""kafee hadd tak bhediyon yaa kutton ke jhund ke tarah"" (to a great extent like packs of wolves or dogs).
*   **C: Ner aur maadaaen ek-dusre ke karib judee hoti hain** - The passage states, ""Bahanon aur betiyon ka ek bada parivar hone ke naate, maadaaen aam taur par ek-dusre ke karib judee hoti hain"" (Because they are a large family of sisters and daughters, females are usually closely connected to each other).
*   **D: Ve ghatak aur samajik dono hain** - The passage describes them as ""bahut ghaatak bhi hote hain"" (very deadly) and the entire text focuses on their social structure (pride).

Therefore, option B is the statement that is *not* accurately described in the passage."
Inme se konsa kathan Shareon ke vyavhaar ka satik varnan nahi karta?,"The correct answer is **D: Ve kafee hadd tak billiyon ki tarah vayvhaar karte hain** (They behave a lot like cats).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states shers (lions) behave *remarkably similarly* to wolves or dogs in their behavior**, not cats. It highlights their social structure and hunting techniques are comparable to those of canids (wolves/dogs), not typical feline behavior.
* The passage *does* say they are the largest social cats, but the comparison is to *other social animals* like wolves, not to cats generally.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: ve bahut samajik hote hain** (They are very social) - The passage begins by stating lions live in prides, which are the largest social groups among big cats.
* **B: Kafee hadd tak bhediyon ki tarah vayvhaar karte hain** (They behave a lot like wolves) - The passage directly compares lion prides to wolf packs.
* **C: Ner aur maada apne shikar ke liye bahut ghaatak hote hain** (Males and females are very deadly in their hunting) - The passage states they are ""very deadly"" hunters.



"
Khargosh aam taur par kis tarah ke shikariyon ka shikar hote hain?,"The correct answer is **C: Madhyam aakar ki billiyaan** (Medium-sized cats).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Unke antargat adhik madhyam aakar ki billiyaan hoti hain jo khargoshon se lekar mrigon aur hiranon tak ke madhyam aakar ke shikar khaati hain.""  This directly translates to ""They include more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to deer and elk.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chhoti billiyaan** (Small cats) - The passage says small cats eat *smaller* prey like insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
*   **B: Badi billiyaan** (Big cats) - The passage doesn't specifically mention big cats hunting rabbits.
*   **D: Mirag** (Deer) - Deer are prey, not predators of rabbits.



"
Chhoti billiyaan aam taur par inme se kiska shikar karti hain?,"The correct answer is **A: Rodents**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""अंत में, कई ऐसी छोटी बिल्लियाँ (loose pet cats सहित) हैं जो कीट, **rodents**, छिपकलियों और पक्षियों जैसे कई छोटे जीवों को खाती हैं।"" (Finally, many small cats (including loose pet cats) eat many small creatures like insects, **rodents**, lizards, and birds.)

The other options (Khargosh - rabbits, Mirag - deer, Hiran - deer) are mentioned as prey for *larger* cats, not the *small* cats described in that part of the passage.



"
Inme se konsa Ocelot ke shikar ka tarika nhi hai?,"Correct answer is **A: Parivesh ke hisab se dhalna (Camouflaging to blend with the environment)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes Ocelots hunting using:

*   **Sugandh ka peecha karna (Following the scent of their prey):** ""Vaigyaanikon ka maanana hai ki ocelots gandh ke dwara jaanvaron ka peechha karte aur khaate...""
*   **Raat mein peecha karna (Hunting at night):** ""Way raat ke andhere mein bahut achchi tarah se dekh sakte hain...""
*   **Chhote jaanvaron ka shikar (Hunting small animals):** ""...lagbhag sabhi janwar jo auselat ka shikar hote hain, ince bahut chhote hote hain.""

The passage does **not** mention Ocelots camouflaging themselves to blend with their environment. They are described as stalking and pouncing, relying on scent and night vision. Therefore, camouflaging isn't part of the described hunting method."
Inme se konsa Ocelot ka sahi se varnan nhi karta? ,"The correct answer is **C: Unke soonghne ki kshamta kam hain** (Their sense of smell is weak).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Vaigyaanikon ka maanana hai ki ocelots gandh ke dwara jaanvaron ka peechha karte aur khaate (shikar) hain, yah soonghate hue ki way meenan par kahaan rahe honge."" (Scientists believe that ocelots track and eat animals by smell, figuring out where the fish are.) This directly indicates that ocelots have a *strong* sense of smell, not a weak one.

Let's look at why the other options are correct descriptions based on the passage:

*   **A: Ve raat mein bhi shikar kar sakte hain** (They can hunt at night) - The passage says ""Way raat ke andhere mein bahut achchi tarah se dekh sakte hain"" (They can see very well in the dark) which supports nighttime hunting.
*   **B: Ve chupke se aage badhte hain** (They move silently) - The passage says ""Way bahut hi chupkese aage bada sakte hain"" (They can move very silently).
*   **D: Ve chhote janvaron ka shikar karte hain** (They hunt small animals) - The passage clearly states ""Ocelot, chhote jaanvaron ko khana pasand karte hain"" (Ocelots like to eat small animals).



"
Inme se kise bagh ki sabse badi takat nahi mana jata?,"The correct answer is **A: Dahaad (Roar)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bagh ke dahaad kisi share ke tez aawaaz vaali dahaad ke tarah nahin hoti, lekinuski bandhi hui, chillaane jaisi hoti hai."" This translates to: ""A tiger's roar is not as loud as a lion's roar, but it is restrained, more like a scream.""  This indicates the tiger's roar isn't its *strongest* ability; it's weaker compared to a lion's roar.

The passage specifically highlights the tiger's strength in climbing, swimming, jumping, and pulling as being very strong (like a fully developed athlete, and 5 times a strong human). Therefore, these are all considered significant strengths.  The roar is the one described as comparatively weaker."
Passage ke hisab se bagh aur sher mein kya antar hai?,"Correct answer is **B: Dahaadne ki aawaz**.

The passage specifically states: ""Bagh ke dahaad kisi share ke tez aawaaz vaali dahaad ke tarah nahin hoti, lekinuski bandhi hui, chillaane jaisi hoti hai."" (A tiger's roar doesn't sound like a lion's loud roar, but is more bound and scream-like.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tairne ki kshamta:** The passage says tigers *can* swim, as can lions.
*   **C: Chhalang lagane ki duri:** The passage says tigers can leap long distances, but doesn't compare this to lions.
*   **D: Khinchne ki taakat:** The passage states tigers can pull five times their weight, but does not compare it to lions.



"
Passage ke hisab se Robert Hook biologist se pehle kya kaam karte the?,"The correct answer is **A: Mrit koshikaon ka nireekshan**.

The passage states: ""wah (robbert hook) mrit koshikaon ka nireekshan karne waale pehle vyakti the."" (He (Robert Hook) was the first person to observe dead cells).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Microscope mein se jeevit chijon ko dekhna** - The passage says *anyone* looking through a microscope will see cells, it doesn't say Hooke was the first to do this generally.
* **C: Chhote chaukhanon ka nireekshan** - He *saw* small squares, but his first work was observing the dead cells themselves. The squares were what he observed *in* the cells.
* **D: Jeevit jeev ke sabse chhoti karyatmak ikai ki khoj** - The passage states that a cell *is* the smallest unit, but doesn't say Hooke *discovered* that fact. He observed cells, but the understanding of their fundamental importance came later.



"
Cell ka kya matlab hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Chhota kamra**.

The passage states: ""Sell latin shabd cellase aata hai jiska earth hai chhota kamra."" This translates to ""Cell comes from the Latin word 'cellula' which means small room.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""Cell"" is a small room.



"
Passage ke hisab se adhikatar janwar kya kar sakte hain?,"The correct answer is **B: Chalna**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""adhikatar janwar chal sakte hain"" which translates to ""most animals can walk"". 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Urana (fly):** The passage mentions animals *can* fly, but doesn't say *most* can.
*   **C: Tairna (swim):** The passage mentions animals *can* swim, but doesn't say *most* can.
*   **D: Khodna (dig):** The passage says animals *dig burrows*, but doesn't say *most* can.



"
Passage ke hisab se kuch janwaron ke pass kya nhi hota?,"The correct answer is **C: Dimag**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kewal jaanvaron mein dimag hota hai (haalaanki sabhi jaanvaron mein nahin hota hai; udaaharan ke liye, jelifish mein dimag nahin hota hai).""  This translates to ""Only animals have brains (although not all animals have them; for example, jellyfish do not have brains).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Koshikaien (Cells)** - The passage begins by stating animals *are* made of cells.
*   **B: Pachaane ki kshamta (Ability to digest)** - The passage states animals eat and digest food.
*   **D: Khane ki kshamta (Ability to eat)** - The passage states animals eat.



"
Photosynthesis ki prakriya se paudhon ko kya milta hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Bhojan (Food)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Paudhe photosynthesis dwara suryase apna **bhojan** banaate hain."" (Plants make their **food** through photosynthesis using sunlight.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chhaya (Shadow)** - Plants *provide* shade, but don't *receive* it through photosynthesis.
*   **B: Janwar (Animals)** - Animals depend on plants, but plants don't get anything from animals through photosynthesis.
*   **D: Dhoop (Sunlight)** - Sunlight is *used* in photosynthesis, it isn't what the plant *gets* from the process.



"
Manushya kya saass chhodte hain jo paudhe saass lete hain?,"The correct answer is **D: Carbon dioxide**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Paudhe way carbon-dioxide lete hain jo manushya saasse chhodate hain"" which translates to ""Plants take in carbon dioxide which humans exhale (breathe out).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bhojan (Food)** - Humans don't exhale food.
*   **B: Oxygen** - Humans inhale oxygen, they don't exhale it.
*   **C: Paani (Water)** - While we exhale some water vapor, carbon dioxide is the primary gas exchanged that plants use.



"
Passage ke hisab se inme se konsa udharan vikas ki prakriya mein badha banega?,"The correct answer is **A: Chhota samooh kisi nayi jagah par nhi reh paa raha hai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explains speciation happens *when* a small group successfully establishes itself in a new environment.** They *need* to adapt to survive. If the small group *cannot* survive in the new environment, speciation won't occur.  This is a *barrier* to the process described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ek abadi ka hissa naye mahul mein jaa raha hai** - This is the *starting point* of speciation, as described in the passage. It's not a hindrance, it's the beginning.
* **C: Abadi apne aap ko naye mahul mein dhal rahi hai** - This is the *process* of adaptation that leads to speciation. It's essential for the passage's explanation.
* **D: Ek abadi do hisson mein bant rahi hai** - This is also a necessary *step* in speciation – the initial division of the population.



"
Inme se konsa kathan prajaatikaran ka sateek varnan nhi karta? ,"The correct answer is **A: Yah tab hota hai jab koi abadi kisi mahul mein nhi dhal paati (It happens when a population cannot adapt to an environment).**

Here's why:

The passage *explicitly* states that speciation happens when a population *does* adapt to a new environment – specifically, a different environment than the original population. The new environment has different resources and competitors, *forcing* adaptation.  If a population *couldn't* adapt, it would likely go extinct, not speciate.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: Yah vikas ka ek bahut mahatvapurn hissa hai (It is a very important part of evolution)** - The passage directly states this.
* **C: Issne ek nayi prajati banti hai (It creates a new species)** - The passage defines speciation as the process of forming new species.
* **D: Iska hona zaruri hai (It is necessary)** - While not stated as 'necessary', the passage implies it's a fundamental process in the formation of Earth’s species, making it crucial for evolution.



"
Circulatory system ka konsa hissa rakt ko hriday tak le jata hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Dhamani** (Veins).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hridayse rakt naliyonse baahar jaataa hai jinhen **dhamani** kahaa jaataa hai nalikaonse hriday mein vaapas aata hai jinhen **dhamani** kahaa jaataa hai."" (Blood goes out of the heart through blood vessels called arteries and returns to the heart through vessels called veins.)

Therefore, veins (dhamani) are the blood vessels that carry blood *to* the heart.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Keshika (Capillaries):** These are the *smallest* blood vessels and facilitate exchange of materials, not transport *to* the heart.
* **C: Ang (Limb/Organ):** This is a body part, not a component of the circulatory system responsible for transport.
* **D: Nasen (Nose):** This is a body part and not part of the circulatory system.



"
Circulatory system mein konsi naliyan sabse chhoti hoti hain?,"The correct answer is **A: Keshika**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** states: ""sabse patali nalika ko keshika kahaa jaataa hai"" - which translates to ""the thinnest tube is called a capillary"".
* Therefore, capillaries (keshika) are the smallest blood vessels in the circulatory system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dhamani (Arteries):** Arteries carry blood *away* from the heart, and are larger than capillaries.
* **C: Nasen (Veins):** Veins carry blood *to* the heart, and are also larger than capillaries.
* **D: Ang (Limbs/Organs):** Limbs and organs are not blood vessels.



"
Keede ke apne pankha ko vaapas apne shareer par lane ke kshamta inme se kis cheez ko badhati hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Shikariyon se chhipane**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""यह [keeton ko apne pankha ko vaapas apne shareer par oo lene ka fayda] unhein shikariyonse chhipane ke liye chhote asthanon ke ek bahut bee shrinkhala deta hai."" (This [the ability of insects to fold their wings back onto their body] gives them a very complex chain of small spaces to hide from predators.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bhojan lane:** While flying helps with finding food, the passage doesn't mention wing-folding specifically aiding in food gathering.
*   **C: Saathi dundhane:** Similar to food, flying is helpful, but the passage doesn't link wing-folding to finding mates.
*   **D: Udne ki speed mein:** The passage doesn't mention anything about wing-folding affecting flight speed.



"
Inme se konse cheez passage mein nhi batayi gayi hai jo keede ki urdne ki kshamta ko prabhavit karti hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Jeevankaal (Lifespan)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage focuses on:**
    *   How flight helped insects evade predators (dushmanon ko bachane mein)
    *   How flight helped insects find food and mates (bhojan aur saathi ko paane mein)
    *   The advantage of folding wings for hiding (shikariyonse chhipane ke liye)
    *   Food gathering (bhojan ikattha karna) is specifically mentioned as a benefit of flight.
    *   Efficiency (kushalata) is also mentioned as something flight improves.
    *   Reproduction (prajanan) is implied as flight helps in finding mates.

*   **Lifespan (Jeevankaal)** is *not* discussed or even alluded to in the passage. It doesn't explain how flight affects how long insects live.

Therefore, **Jeevankaal (Lifespan)** is the only option not mentioned in the passage as something influenced by an insect's ability to fly."
Inme se dynasore ki konsi vishesta nhai hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Pankh** (Feathers).

Here's why:

The passage states that *because* birds have feathers, many people don't consider them dinosaurs. It highlights feathers as the main difference people perceive. The passage is arguing that despite the feathers, birds *are* dinosaurs, and shares several dinosaur characteristics like scales on legs, claws, laying eggs, and walking on two legs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Peechhe vaale pairon par chalna (Walking on hind legs):** The passage *specifically* mentions birds walking on their two hind legs like dinosaurs.
* **C: Anda dena (Laying eggs):**  The passage explicitly states birds lay eggs, a dinosaur characteristic.
* **D: Panje wale pair (Clawed feet):** The passage states birds have claws on their feet, another dinosaur characteristic.



"
Inme se kise aam taur par pakshiyon aur dynasore ki visheshta nhi mana jata hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Urne ki kshamta (The ability to fly)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that people *don't* consider birds dinosaurs *because* of their wings and ability to fly. It highlights the fact that despite shared dinosaur-like traits (scales, claws, laying eggs, walking on two legs), the ability to fly is a major distinguishing factor in people's minds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ande dena (Laying eggs):** The passage *mentions* egg-laying as a dinosaur-like trait in birds.
*   **B: Peechhe vaale pairon par chalna (Walking on hind legs):** The passage describes birds walking on their two hind legs ""like tea-rakes"" - a dinosaur-like characteristic.
*   **D: Panje wale pair (Clawed feet):** The passage specifically states birds have claws (""papadiyan aur panje"") like dinosaurs.



"
Passage ke hisab se triceratops cycads paudhe kis hisse ko khate hain?,"The correct answer is **A: Kantedar pattiy** (Thorny leaves).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Triceratops prajaati ke dynasore, paid ke taney khanese pehle unaki pattiyon aur tahaniyon ko apni shaktishali chonchse todkar alag kar sakte the."" 

This translates to: ""Triceratops dinosaurs could break off and separate the leaves and branches of the plant before eating the trunk.""

Therefore, they ate the **pattiyon** (leaves), which are described as ""kantedar pattiyon"" (thorny leaves).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Taney (Trunks):** The passage says they broke off leaves *before* eating the trunk.
* **C: Jadein (Roots):** The passage does not mention the roots.
* **D: Full (Fruits):** The passage does not mention fruits.



"
Passage ke hisab se triceratops inme se konsa khana sabse adhik khaate hai? ,"The correct answer is **B: Sakht shaakhaon wale paid**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Triceratops prajaati ke dynasore, paid ke taney khanese pehle unaki pattiyon aur tahaniyon ko apni shaktishali chonchse todkar alag kar sakte the.""  This directly says Triceratops ate the leaves and branches of trees (paid).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sloth** - The passage only mentions sloths as an example of modern animals that *can* eat poisonous plants, not that Triceratops ate them.
*   **C: Tota** - Similar to sloths, totas are just used as an example.
*   **D: Jaharile full wale paid** - The passage *discusses* whether Triceratops could eat poisonous plants, with some scientists believing they were too toxic. It doesn't state they *did* eat them. It states that some scientist believe it's unlikely Triceratops ate them.



"
Passage ke hisab se inme se konse khel Italy ke uttari kshetron mein lokpriya hain?,"The passage states: ""Antarrashtriya khelon aur olympic spardhaon mein pratispardha karne vaale italians ke saath, **shitkaleen khel** uttari kshetron mein sabse lokpriya hain.""

""Shitkaleen khel"" translates to winter sports.  Snowboarding is a winter sport.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Snowboarding**.

While football is popular in Italy overall (mentioned in the passage), the passage specifically states *winter* sports are most popular in the northern regions.  Volleyball and F1 motor racing are not mentioned as being particularly popular in the north.



"
Passage ke hisab se Italy ne inme se kis khel ki championship jeete?,"The correct answer is **A: Football**.

The passage explicitly states that Italy was the winner of the FIFA World Cup 2006. This means they won the championship in football. The other options are mentioned as popular sports in Italy, but the passage doesn't say Italy won championships in those."
Kis ghatna ke baad Luxembourg ka kuch hissa belgium ka hissa ban gaya?,"The correct answer is **B: Belgium kranti**.

The text explicitly states: ""Vartamaan mein belgium ka hissa ateet mein luxemberg ka hissa tha lekin 1830 ke dashak ke belgium kranti ke baad belgium bn gaya."" (Currently a part of Belgium was formerly a part of Luxembourg, but became Belgium after the Belgian Revolution of the 1830s).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vishwa yuddh I (World War I)** - The text says Germany occupied Luxembourg during WWI, but doesn't mention it losing territory to Belgium then.
*   **C: Vishwa yuddh II (World War II)** - Similar to WWI, Germany occupied Luxembourg, but no territorial loss to Belgium is mentioned.
*   **D: European sangh ki sthapana (Establishment of the European Union)** - This event saw Luxembourg *join* an organization, not lose territory."
Inme se kisne Luxembourg ki tatasth par asar dala?,"सही जवाब है **A: Germany का कब्ज़ा**।

टेक्स्ट में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि जर्मनी ने प्रथम विश्व युद्ध और द्वितीय विश्व युद्ध में लक्जमबर्ग पर कब्ज़ा कर लिया था, जिससे उसकी तटस्थता प्रभावित हुई।

अन्य विकल्प गलत क्यों हैं:

*   **B: European संघ की सदस्यता:** यूरोपीय संघ की सदस्यता ने लक्जमबर्ग की तटस्थता को प्रभावित नहीं किया।
*   **C: बेल्जियम क्रांति:** बेल्जियम क्रांति ने लक्जमबर्ग के इतिहास को प्रभावित किया, लेकिन उसकी तटस्थता को सीधे तौर पर प्रभावित नहीं किया।
*   **D: स्वतंत्र देश बनना:** स्वतंत्र देश बनने से लक्जमबर्ग को अपनी नीति चुनने की स्वतंत्रता मिली, लेकिन यह जर्मनी के कब्ज़े की तरह तटस्थता को सीधे तौर पर प्रभावित नहीं करता।"
Turkey ke kul kshetrafal mein se kitna varg kilometre Europe mein hai?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The passage states: ""Turkey ka ilaka, jhilon sahit, 783,562 varg kilometres (300,948 varg meal) par hain ,jismein se 755,688 varg kilometres (291,773 varg meal) dakshin paschim asia mein aur **23,764 varg kilometres (9,174 varg meal) europe mein hain**.""

Therefore, 23,764 square kilometers of Turkey's total area is in Europe."
Passage ke hisab se Turkey lagbhag kitne mile lambi hai?,"The correct answer is **D: 1000**.

The passage states: ""Turkey ka kshetrafal 1,600 kilometres (1,000 meter) lamba aur 800 kilo meter (500 meal) chauda hai...""  It explicitly states Turkey is 1,600 kilometers long *or* 1,000 miles long.

Therefore, the answer is 1000."
Vatican city mein latin bhasha ka istemal kis mein kiya jata hai?,"सही उत्तर है: **A: धार्मिक रसमें**

अनुच्छेद स्पष्ट रूप से बताता है कि ""latin का धार्मिक रस्मों में इस्तेमाल किया जाता है।""

अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि:

*   **B: रोज़ाना इस्तेमाल होने वाली भाषा** - अनुच्छेद कहता है कि इतालवी रोज़मर्रा की भाषा है।
*   **C: कानूनी भाषा** - अनुच्छेद कहता है कि कानूनी और आधिकारिक संचार में इतालवी का उपयोग होता है।
*   **D: आधिकारिक भाषा** - अनुच्छेद कहता है कि कानूनी और आधिकारिक संचार में इतालवी का उपयोग होता है।"
Vatican city mein Italian bhasha ka istemal kis mein nhi kiya jata?,"Sahī javāb hai **C: Dhaarmik rasmein**.

P parāgraph mein batāyā gayā hai ki Latin kā istemāl dhaarmik rasmon mein kiya jaatā hai, Italian nahī. Isliye, Italian bhashā ka istemāl dhaarmik rasmon mein nahīं hota hai.

Other options are incorrect because the paragraph states that Italian is used in legal and official communication, and is the everyday language used by most people in Vatican City."
Passage ke hisab se parishkrit computer par dhwani ko mix karke inme se konsa fayda hota hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sangeet (Music)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dhvani ko process aur ek saath mix karne ke liye parishkrit computer ka upayog karke sangeet record kiya jaataa hai."" This translates to ""Music is recorded by using sophisticated computers to process and mix sound together.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Animation:** The passage mentions animation being *created* on computers, but doesn't link it to sophisticated computers for sound mixing.
*   **C: Tasveer (Picture):** The passage mentions pictures/images being manipulated, but not in connection with the sophisticated computer use for sound.
*   **D: Koi cheez banana (To create something):** This is too vague. The passage specifies *what* is created – music.



"
Passage ke hisab se inme se kis jagah par lagbhag har ghar mein ek flush shauchalaya hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Hadappa aur Mohenjo-daro ke shaharon mein lagbhag har ghar mein ek flush shauchalaya tha..."" (In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Persia:** The passage states Persia *had* toilets, but not that *every* house had one.
*   **C: Santorini:** The passage mentions sewage systems were *found* in Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, not flush toilets in every home.
*   **D: China:** The passage states China *had* toilets, but not that *every* house had one.



"
Inme se kis jagah par behatar sivej system hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that **""Hadappa aur mohan-jodado ke shaharon mein lagbhag har ghar mein ek flush shauchalaya tha, jo ek parishkrit cvage systemse judaa tha""** (Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a purified sewage system). This indicates a highly developed and widespread sewage system in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, far surpassing the descriptions given for Santorini, Egypt, or China.

While the other locations *had* toilets or sewage systems, the description for Harappa is the most comprehensive and advanced."
Inme se kis vajah se skate mudata hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Blade thoda sa ghumaavdaar tall** (Blade has a slightly curved heel).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kyonki blade ka tall thoda ghumaavdaar hota hai, jisase blade ek taraf yaa doosri taraf jhuk jaati hai aur jo kinare barf ke sampark mein hoti hai, wah bhi mud jaati hai. is karan skater mudataa hai."" (Because the heel of the blade is slightly curved, the blade leans to one side or the other, and the edges in contact with the snow also turn. This is why the skater turns. If the skates lean right, the skater turns right, if the skates lean left, the skater turns left.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Skate ke blade ke dodhari kinare** (Double-edged blades of the skate): While double-edged blades are a feature, the passage explains *how* those blades are used for turning, which relies on the curved heel.
* **C: Skater ki skill** (Skater's skill): Skill is important for skating in general, but the passage focuses on the *mechanism* of turning, not the skill level required.
* **D: Barf ki quality** (Quality of snow): Snow quality affects skating, but it doesn’t *cause* the turning mechanism described in the passage.



"
Passage ke hisab se inme se kaun si cheez adhunik ice skate ke khokhlepan ka sateek varnan karti hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Avatal (凹)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...unke beach ek **avtal khokhla aakar** hota hai."" (…their bottom has a **concave hollow shape**.) This directly describes the hollowness of modern ice skates.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dohare kinare (Double edges):** While the blade *has* two edges, the passage focuses on the *shape* of those edges (hollow).
*   **B: Ghumaavdaar (Twisted):** The passage mentions the *shank* is slightly twisted, which *causes* the turning, but doesn’t *describe* the hollowness itself.
*   **D: Mudanaa (Turning):**  Turning is a *result* of the hollowness, not a description of it.



"
Passage ke hisab se konsi prakriya parmaanuon ko atirikt oorjaa se chhutkara dilati hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Vikiran ka uttejit utsarjan** (Stimulated emission of radiation).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Vaigyaanik is prakriya ko """"vikiran ka uttejit utsarjan"""" kahte hain, kyonki parmaanuon ko tez prakash dwara uttejit kiya jaataa hai, jisase prakash ke photon ka utsarjan hota hai aur prakash ek tarah ka vikiran hai.""  This translates to: ""Scientists call this process """"stimulated emission of radiation"""" because atoms are excited by intense light, causing the emission of photons of light and light is a type of radiation.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vikiran (Radiation):** While radiation is *involved*, it's not the *process* that releases energy.
* **B: Photon ka uttejit utsarjan (Stimulated emission of photons):** This isn't the term used in the passage. It's *stimulated emission of radiation* that's described.
* **C: Photon (Photon):** Photons are the *result* of the process, not the process itself.



"
Parmaanuon photon ko kyu nikalte hain?,"The correct answer is **A: Atirikt oorjaa nikalne ke liye** (To get rid of excess energy).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""unke pichle oorjaa star par vaapas aane ke liye, unhein prakashse mili atirikt oorjaase chhutkara panna hoga.""  This translates to ""To return to their previous energy level, they must get rid of the extra energy they received from the light.""  The passage then explains photons are *how* they get rid of that excess energy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tez prakash ki vajah se utsarjan** (Because of stimulated emission of bright light) - While stimulated emission *triggers* the process, it's not *why* atoms release photons. It's the excess energy that drives the release.
* **C: Asthir oorjaa star** (Unstable energy level) -  The passage describes atoms *returning* to a lower energy level, implying they were initially in a higher (and thus, energetic) state, not necessarily unstable.
* **D: Vikiran ka bura asar** (The bad effect of radiation) - The passage explains that light *is* a form of radiation, and the process isn't about a negative effect.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, prakash bulb kis wajah se kaam nahi karta?","The correct answer is **C: Bulb ke andar filament jal jaana** (The filament inside the bulb burns out).

The passage explicitly states: ""Saikadon ghante tak kary karne ke baad bulb ka filament jal jaataa hai aur iske baad light bulb kam nahin karta."" (After working for hundreds of hours, the filament of the bulb burns out and after that, the light bulb does not work.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Switch sahi se band na kiya jana** (Switch not being turned off properly) - The passage doesn't mention the switch being the cause of the bulb failing.
*   **B: Bulb ka kuch dhaatu ka aadhar socket mein adhoora lagna** (Some metal base of the bulb not fully fitting into the socket) - While the passage warns about touching the metal base when the socket is live, it doesn’t say this *causes* the bulb to stop working. It’s a safety hazard.
*   **D: Socket mein bijli ka pravaah dheema hona** (The flow of electricity in the socket being slow) - The passage does not mention anything about the electricity flow being slow.



"
Prakash bulb badalte samay inmein se kya chhuna khatarnaak ho sakta hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Bulb ke neeche ka hissa** (The lower part of the bulb).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Iska kuch bhaag jab socket ke under hota hai agarus samay aap socket ke under yaa bulb ke dhaatu ke aadhar ko chhoote hain, toh bulb ke dhaatu ka hissa aapko ek gambhir bijli ka jhatka dei sakta hai..."" This directly translates to: ""Some part of it is under the socket at this time if you touch under the socket or the metal base of the bulb, the metal part of the bulb can give you a serious electric shock...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Filament:** The filament burns out *after* use, it's not a shock hazard during replacement.
*   **B: Prakash ka switch:** While it's good practice to turn off the switch, the switch itself isn't a shock hazard if you touch it.
*   **D: Cable:** Disconnecting the cable is a safety measure, but the cable itself isn't the immediate danger during bulb replacement if the switch is on.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, naabhik ke alag hone par kya hoga?","The correct answer is **B: Oorja nikalti hai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...nucleus ko phir se vibhajit karna *aurusmense kuch oorjaa nikalana*."" which translates to ""...splitting the nucleus again *releases some energy*.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Protons badhte hai (Protons increase):** The passage doesn't mention an increase in protons during nuclear fission.
*   **C: Parmaanu asthir hote hain (Atoms become unstable):** The passage says *some* nuclei *are* unstable, not that they *become* unstable upon splitting.
*   **D: Neutrons kho jaate hain (Neutrons are lost):** While neutrons can be released during nuclear fission, the passage doesn't state this as the direct result of a nucleus splitting.



"
Inmein se kya lambi doori ki call waapas Prithvi par paravartit karta hai,"The correct answer is **B: Upgrah (Satellite)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Antariksh mein upgrah ko call milata hai aur phir ise vaapas niche, use samay paravartit karta hai."" (The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down, changing its time).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Telescopes (Doorbeenon)** - The passage says telescopes are used for *observing* light, not for relaying calls.
*   **C: Prakash (Light)** - Light is what can be distorted by the atmosphere, but it doesn't *reflect* calls.
*   **D: Rockets** - Rockets are used to *launch* satellites, but they don't handle the call reflection themselves.



"
Inmein se kya telescope ko antriksh mein rakhta hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Rockets**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Upgrah ko ek roketse antariksh mein bheja gaya tha."" (Satellites are sent into space by a rocket.) Telescopes are also placed in space using rockets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Light beams:** Light beams *are* what telescopes detect, but they don't *place* telescopes in space.
*   **C: Prithvi ka vaayumandal (Earth's atmosphere):** The atmosphere is the *reason* telescopes are put in space, not what puts them there.
*   **D: 100 feet se upar sthit satellites (Satellites above 100 feet):** While satellites are in space, they don't place telescopes there - rockets do. They are the *result* of rocket launches, not the means of launching.



"
Samay ke beetne par nazar rakhne ke liye chakreeya ghatna ke baare mein kis baat ko dhyaan mein rakhna chahiye?,"The correct answer is **B: Dohrao (Repetition)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**Aap chakreeya ghatnaaon ke dohrao ko gaurse dekhkar samay ke badlav ko chinhit kar sakte hain.**"" (You can mark the change of time by closely observing the repetition of cyclical events.)

This directly links tracking time to noticing the *repetition* within cyclical events.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Samay (Time):** While the passage is *about* time, it doesn't say to focus on time itself to track its passage.
*   **C: Asar (Effect):** The passage mentions time *affecting* things, but doesn't say to focus on the effects to track time.
*   **D: Mushkil (Difficult):** The passage states time is difficult to understand, but doesn't suggest focusing on the difficulty to track its passage.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, samay ko ghatna ki kis baat ki tulna ke liye upyog kiya jaata hai?","The correct answer is **A: Lambaai (Duration/Length)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Samay yah bhi hai ki hum ghatnaaon ke avadhi (lambai) ke tulna kaise karte hain."" 

This directly translates to: ""Time is also how we compare the duration (length) of events.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dohrao (Repetition):** While the passage *mentions* cyclical events and repetitions as a way to *mark* the passage of time, it doesn't say time *is* used for comparing repetitions.
* **C: Anubhav (Experience):** The passage says we *experience* time as a flow from past to future, but doesn't state that time is used to compare experiences.
* **D: Asar (Effect/Impact):** The passage mentions time *influences* things, but it doesn't say time is used to compare the effects of events.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, takht ke uttaradhikari ke liye kya paramparagat maana jaata hai?","The correct answer is **B: Vishvavidhyalay chhodkar sena mein jana**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""parmparagat roop se, takht ka uttaradhikari schooly shiksha puri karne ke baad seedhe sena mein jayega.""  This translates to: ""Traditionally, the heir to the throne would go straight into the army after completing their schooling.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 2:2 degree haasil karna** - The passage mentions Charles *received* a 2:2 degree, but doesn't state it's traditional. It highlights that he was the *first* royal family member to get a degree.
* **C: Itihaas padhna** - The passage mentions Charles studied humanities, archaeology, and later history, but doesn't say this is a traditional requirement.
* **D: Sena mein jane se pehle vishvavidhyalay jana** - The passage explicitly states this is *not* traditional. Charles was the first to do so.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Charles ne pehli baar kya kiya?","सही उत्तर है **C: Degree haasil ki**.

Passage में स्पष्ट रूप से लिखा है कि चार्ल्स ब्रिटिश शाही परिवार के पहले सदस्य थे जिन्हें डिग्री प्रदान की गई थी। इसलिए, चार्ल्स ने सबसे पहले डिग्री हासिल की।

अन्य विकल्प गलत क्यों हैं:

* **A: School poora karne se pehle sena mein jana** - Passage कहता है कि पारंपरिक रूप से उत्तराधिकारी स्कूल के बाद सेना में जाते थे, लेकिन चार्ल्स ने ऐसा नहीं किया।
* **B: Puratatva shastra padha** - चार्ल्स ने पुरातत्व का अध्ययन किया, लेकिन यह उनकी पहली उपलब्धि नहीं थी।
* **D: Trinity college gaye** - चार्ल्स ने Trinity College में प्रवेश लिया, लेकिन डिग्री हासिल करना उनकी पहली उपलब्धि थी।"
Trygvasson bera kis desh ka tha?,"The correct answer is **D: Norway**.

The text explicitly states: ""Norwaywasi, Olaf Trygvasson..."". This means Olaf Trygvasson was from Norway."
Itihaas mein kis samay Germany ka Estonia par bada sanskritik prabhav tha?,"The passage states the influence was around the 15th century. Let's calculate how many years ago that was (approximately):

2024 (current year) - 1450 (15th century) = 574 years.

Therefore, the closest answer is **C: Lagbhag 600 saal pehle** (Approximately 600 years ago).



"
Estonia ki bhasha par kiska asar tha?,"The correct answer is **B: German varnmala**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the Estonian written language was *based on* the German alphabet (""yah german varnamala par adharit tha""). While other options are mentioned in the context, the fundamental influence on the *language itself* was the German alphabet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Õ/õ akshar ka** - This is a result *of* the influence, not the influence itself.
*   **C: German bhikshu** - They *used* the language to spread religion, but they weren't the source of the linguistic influence.
*   **D: Ishwar** -  Religion is mentioned as the *reason* for the language's creation, but not as a linguistic influence.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, mool roop se Hindi bolne waalon ki sankhya kis aadhar par ghatti badhti hai?","The correct answer is **A: Kya Hindi jaisi boliyon ko joda jaata hai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sthaaniya bhasha bolane waale logon ke sankhya is aadhar par alag ho sakti hai ki sambandhit boliyon ke ginati bahut barikise ke jaati hai yaa nahin.""  This translates to: ""The number of native speakers can vary depending on whether the count of related dialects is done very precisely or not."" 

This directly addresses how the number of Hindi speakers fluctuates based on *how* (or *if*) related dialects are included in the count.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kya Urdu bolne waalon ko joda jaata hai:** The passage mentions Hindi and Urdu are mutually intelligible, but doesn't say the speaker count changes *based on* including Urdu speakers.
*   **C: Kya bhasha ko samajhne waalon ko joda jaata hai:** The passage *states* how many people understand Hindi, but doesn't say the core speaker count is based on this understanding.
*   **D: Kya bhasha ko padh sakne waalon ko joda jaata hai:** The passage doesn’t mention reading ability.



"
Hindi aur Urdu bhashaon ke liye inmein se kaunsi baat sahi hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Unki lipi alag hai** (Their scripts are different).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Hindi aur urdu shabdakosh samaan hain lekin unaki lipi alag hai"" (Hindi and Urdu have the same vocabulary but different scripts).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aam taur par, dono bhashaon ko bolne walon mein dohrao hai** (Generally, there is overlap among those who speak both languages) - While the text *implies* this (""rosemarra ke baatchit mein, dono bhaashaon ke bolane waale aam taur par ek-dusre ko samajh sakte hain"" - in everyday conversation, speakers of both languages generally understand each other), it doesn't directly state it as a fact.
*   **C: Unka shabdkosh aur lipi samaan hain** (Their vocabulary and script are the same) - The text says the *vocabulary* is the same, but explicitly states the *scripts* are different.
*   **D: Unka shabdkosh alag hai** (Their vocabulary is different) - The text states their vocabulary is the *same*.



"
Inmein se kya Hangeul akshar ke baare mein sahi tathya nahi hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Akshar ka mool naam Hunan Jeongeum tha**.

Here's why:

The passage states the original name of the Hangeul alphabet was **Hunmin Jeongeum**, *not* Hunan Jeongeum.  The passage explicitly says: ""Unhone hangeul akshar ka mool naam **Hunmin Jeongeum** rakhaa, jiska earth hai """"logon ke nirdesh ke liye sahi aawaaz.""""

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct:

* **A: Ise Raja Sejong ke rajya mein banaya gaya tha** - The passage states it was created in 1444 during King Sejong's reign.
* **C: Ise Joseon rajvansh ke chauthe raja ne banaya tha** - The passage clearly identifies King Sejong as the fourth ruler of the Joseon dynasty.
* **D: Ise jaanboojh kar banaya gaya tha** -  The passage states ""Sirf Hangeul hi jaanboojh kar banaaya gaya aisaa warn hai..."" (Only Hangeul is a purposefully created writing system).



"
Hunmin Jeongeum akshar ko kis mein badal diya gaya?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

The passage states: ""Unhone hangeul akshar ka mool naam Hunmin Jeongeum rakhaa...""  This translates to ""He gave the original name of the Hangeul alphabet as Hunmin Jeongeum..."" 

Therefore, Hunmin Jeongeum was the original name, and it became known as Hangeul."
"Passage ke hisab se, sanskrit ka asar kin bhashaon par hua hai?","Correct answer is **D: Bhartiye bhashayen**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**Sanskrit ek bahut hi jatil aur samriddh bhasha hai, jisane kayee aadhunik bhartiya bhaashaon ke liye srot hone ka kam kiya hai**"" which translates to ""Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, which has served as a source for many modern Indian languages.""

While the passage draws a parallel to Latin's influence on European languages, it *directly* states Sanskrit's influence on Indian languages. Therefore, option D is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
"Passage ke hisab se, sanskrit ka upyog kis wajah se fika pad gaya?","सही उत्तर है **D: Padanukram**।

Passage में स्पष्ट रूप से लिखा है कि ""upanishadon ke sankalan ke baad, sanskrit kewal padanukram ke karan fika parh gayee।"" जिसका अर्थ है कि उपनिषदों के संकलन के बाद, संस्कृत केवल शिक्षण के माध्यम से जीवित रही, और उसका व्यापक उपयोग कम हो गया।

अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि:

*   **A: Jatilta** - passage sanskrit को जटिल बताती है, लेकिन यह नहीं बताती कि यह जटिलता उसके उपयोग में कमी का कारण बनी।
*   **B: Aryan pravas** - यह सिद्धांत बताता है कि संस्कृत कैसे अस्तित्व में आई, यह उसके उपयोग में कमी का कारण नहीं है।
*   **C: Latin bhashayen** - passage sanskrit की तुलना लैटिन से करती है, लेकिन लैटिन भाषाओं के कारण संस्कृत का उपयोग कम नहीं हुआ।"
"Passage ke hisab se, lo par gravity ke liye inmein se kaunsi baat sahi hai?","The correct answer is **A: Dharti ka gurutvaakarshan lo ke gurutvaakarshan ki tulna mein aapko kum kheenchega.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that if you were standing on Io (Aayo), your weight would be *less* than your weight on Earth.  This is because Io's gravity exerts *less* pull on you.  Therefore, Earth's gravity pulls on you less strongly *compared* to Io's gravity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lo ka gurutvaakarshan adhik khinchega, isliye aapka vazan kum hoga** - Incorrect. Io's gravity is *weaker*, not stronger.
* **C: Lo ka gurutvaakarshan adhik khinchega, isliye aapka vazan adhik hoga** - Incorrect. Stronger gravity would mean more weight.
* **D: Dharti ka gurutvaakarshan lo ke gurutvaakarshan se adhik khinchega** - Incorrect. The passage states the opposite – Io pulls less, making you weigh less.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Inmein se kaunsi baat Chand ki baahri parat ke liye sahi hai?","The correct answer is **C: Sabse door ke sire par kum maria hote hain**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Papdi patali hone ke karan aas-paas par kayee maria hongi."" (Because the crust is thin, there will be many maria around.)  It also states the crust is thinner on the near side (70 km) and thicker on the far side (100 km). Therefore, there would be *fewer* maria on the far side where the crust is thicker.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sabse nazdiki sire par crust ki motaai adhik hoti hai:**  The passage says the opposite - the crust is *thinner* on the near side.
* **B: Unche kshetron ke neeche crust patla hota hai:** The passage states the crust is *thicker* under higher regions.
* **D: Pahadi zameen ke neeche, ho sakta hai ki maria kam hote ho:** While possible, the passage doesn't directly support this; it links maria to the *thinness* of the crust, not specifically to mountainous terrain.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, chaand ki parat sabse moti kis jagah par hai?","The correct answer is **C: Pahadi zameen ke neeche** (Under mountainous regions).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""यह समudra के नीचे पतला और ऊंचे क्षेत्रों के नीचे मोटा होता है."" This translates to ""It is thin under the oceans and thick under higher regions.""  ""Pahadi zameen"" means mountainous regions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Paas ki taraf** (Near side) - While the passage mentions thickness on the near side, it doesn't say it's the *most* thick there, only that it's around 70km.
*   **B: Wahan, jahan maria zyada hai** (Where there are more maria) - The passage states the crust is *thinner* under maria.
*   **D: Maria ke neeche** (Under maria) - Again, the passage says it's thinner under maria.



"
"Passage ke aadhaar par, inmein se kin baaton par kuchh log bharosa karte hain?","The correct answer is **C: Anya grahon par zindagi maujood hai.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""kuch log sochate hain ki vahan kya ho sakta hai jabki kuch any maante hain ki dusren grahaan par elean yaa any jeev ho sakte hain.""  This directly translates to ""some people wonder what could be there, while others believe that aliens or other lifeforms might exist on other planets.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Insaan se doosre stars par travel kiya hai** - The passage discusses *dreaming* of future travel, not current travel.
*   **B: Insaan doosri duniya ki khosh karne ke kabil nahi hai** - The passage does not mention anything about humans being incapable of exploring other worlds.
*   **D: Taaron ke beech kharbon meel se bhi kam doori hoti hai** - The passage specifically says the stars are incredibly far apart - ""kharbon meal ke doori"" (billions of miles).



"
"Veh kya cheez hai jo sooraj ke center se jitna aage hoti jaati hai, utni hi patli hoti jaati hai?","The correct answer is **C: Gais (Gas)**.

The passage states: ""Surya ke kendrase door jaate-jaate gais patali hoti jaati hai."" which translates to ""As you go further from the center of the Sun, the gas becomes thinner.""

Therefore, the answer is gas.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, sooraj ka kaunsa hissa dharti se dikhta hai?","The correct answer is **C: Photosphere**.

The passage specifically states: ""Suraj ko dekhte samay jo baahari bhaag dikhai deta hai, use photosphere (panorama) kahte hain."" (The outer part that is visible when looking at the sun is called the photosphere.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Satah (Surface):** The passage explicitly states the sun *doesn't* have a surface you can stand on.
*   **B: Plasma:** Plasma is what the sun is *made of*, but not the part we see.
*   **D: Center:** The passage mentions the center becomes thinner as you go inward, but doesn't say it's visible from Earth.



"
Inmein se kis observation ki mada se Copernicus theory ki pushti hui?,"Correct answer is **A: Venus ke phases**.

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states: ""shukra kalaayen copernicus ke is siddhant ka samarthan karti hain ki grah surya ke parikrama karte hain."" (Venus' phases support Copernicus' theory that planets orbit the sun). 

Galileo's observation of Venus exhibiting phases (like the moon) was crucial because it only made sense if Venus was orbiting the Sun, not the Earth. This directly contradicted the geocentric model (Earth-centered) and supported the heliocentric model (Sun-centered) proposed by Copernicus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Venus ka transit:** While Horox observed Venus' transit, the passage doesn't say this specifically confirmed Copernicus' theory. It was an observation *after* the initial support from the phases.
*   **C: Sooraj ki Venus se samanta:** The passage doesn't mention any comparison of similarity between Sun and Venus.
*   **D: Sooraj ki chaand se samanta:** The passage doesn't mention any comparison of similarity between Sun and Moon.



"
"1610 mein, Galileo Galilei ne yahan batayi gayi cheezon mein se kya dekha tha?","The correct answer is **B: Venus ke phases**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Karib 3000 saal baad, 1610 mein italy ke khagolvid galilio galileine ek doorbeen ka istemal karte hue yah dekhaa ki **shukra ke charan hain, thik vaise hi jaise chandrama ke hain**.""  This means Galileo observed phases of Venus, just like the phases of the moon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chaand ka veh hissa jo sooraj ki taraf hota hai** - While the passage mentions the phases are *like* the moon's, it doesn't say Galileo specifically observed the illuminated part of the moon.
*   **C: Planet sooraj ke charon taraf chakkar laga raha hai** - Galileo's observation *supported* the idea that planets orbit the sun, but he didn't directly *see* planets orbiting. He saw phases which provided evidence for that idea.
*   **D: Venus ka transit** - The passage states Geremia Horrox observed the transit of Venus in 1639, not Galileo in 1610.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Amazon River ko paani kahan se milta hai?","The correct answer is **A: Chhoti nadiyon se**.

The passage states: ""isamen hajaaron chhoti nadiyan milti hain"" which translates to ""it has thousands of small rivers flowing into it."" This directly answers the question of where the Amazon River gets its water from.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sabse lambi nadi se:** While the Amazon is the longest river, the passage doesn't say it *gets* water from the longest river - it *is* the longest river.
*   **C: Oceans se:** The passage states the Amazon flows *to* the ocean, not that it gets water *from* the ocean.
*   **D: Doosri sabse badi nadi se:** The passage states the Amazon has 8 times more water than the second largest river, but doesn't state it *receives* water from it."
Amazon River ki kis baat ke liye sarahna nahi ki jati hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Yeh sabse badi nadi hai** (It is the biggest river).

Here's why:

The passage states the Amazon is the *second* largest river, and has 8 times more water than the *second* largest river. It does *not* claim it is the largest river overall.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yeh doosri sabse badi nadi hai** - The passage *confirms* this.
*   **C: Yeh sabse lambi nadi hai** - The passage states it is the *second* longest.
*   **D: Yeh sabse chaudi nadi hai** - The passage *confirms* this.

Therefore, the only thing the passage doesn't praise the Amazon for is being the biggest river, it acknowledges it is second to another river."
"Passage mein bataaye gaye kis kaam mein, Venezuela ke logo ko sabse kam naukriyan milti hain?","Sahi jawab **A: Krishi** hai.

Passage mein kaha gaya hai ki Venezuela ke kam karne waalo ka paanchva bhaag (yaani 20%) krishi mein kam karta hai, jo ki deewar sektar mein sabse kam hai. Seva (2/3), udyog (1/4) aur tell (1%) ka hissa isse zyada hai."
"Passage ke hisab se, kis kaam mein Venezuela ke logo ko sabse zyada naukriyan di jati hain?","Correct answer is **A: Serva**

The passage states: ""Venezuela ke kam karne waale do tihai log seva kshetra mein kam karte hain..."" which translates to ""Two-thirds of Venezuelan workers are employed in the service sector..."" This means the service sector employs the most people."
"Passage ke hisab se, fusion se taaron ko kya karne mein madad milti hai?","Correct answer is **C: Raushni aur garmi chhodne mein**.

The passage states: ""Jab bhari tatvon ko banaane ke liye hydrogen parmaanuon ka vile (yaa fusion hota hai), toh jo urja nikalati hai, usese sitaare prakash aur garmi pradaan karte hain."" This directly translates to ""When hydrogen atoms fuse to make heavier elements, the energy released is what stars use to provide light and heat.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Zyada bhaari elements banane mein** - While fusion *does* create heavier elements, the passage states the energy *released from* fusion is what stars use for light and heat.
*   **B: Fusion reactors banane mein** - The passage says scientists are *trying* to build fusion reactors, but it's not what fusion helps stars do.
*   **D: Hydrogen atoms banane mein** - Fusion *uses* hydrogen atoms, it doesn't create them.



"
"Koi faydemand fusion, inmein se kaunsa reactor banayega?","The correct answer is **A: Hydrogen**.

Here's why:

The passage states that *hydrogen atoms fuse* to create heavier elements, and *that process* releases energy. The question asks what will build a useful fusion reactor, and the passage directly links fusion to hydrogen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Stars:** Stars *use* fusion, but they aren't building reactors.
*   **C: Atoms:** Atoms are *involved* in fusion, but aren't the builder of the reactor.
*   **D: Energy:** Energy is *released* by fusion, but it doesn't build anything.



"
Paani ki raasaynik sanrachna kya hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Do hydrogen atom aur ek oxygen atom** (Two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom).

The passage explicitly states: ""Paani doosra udaarahan hai. yogic jal hydrogen ke do anuonse aur oxygen ke ek anuse milkar banaa hota hai.""  This translates to ""Water is another example. Yogic water is made up of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen."""
"Jab paani apna roop badalta hai, to kaunsi cheez waisi hi rehti hai?","The correct answer is **A: Aanvik sanrachana** (Molecular structure).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""iski ek hi aanvik sanrachana hai chaahe wah gais, taral yaa thos ho."" (It has the same molecular structure whether it is gas, liquid, or solid).
* **The passage highlights** that while the *physical state* changes (gas, liquid, solid), the *chemical composition* (and therefore molecular structure) remains the same.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ghanatav (Density):** The passage says liquid state is denser, meaning density *changes* with state.
* **C: Bhautik isthiti (Physical state):** The passage states this *changes*.
* **D: Taral nitrogen (Liquid nitrogen):** This is an example used to illustrate the concept, but it's not what *stays the same* when water changes form.

"Pasaage ke hisab se, kuchh qanoonon ko laagoo karne ki koshish karte samay, terah raajyon ke liye inmein se kaunsa mudda zaroori nahi tha?","सही उत्तर है **A: राज्य अधिकारियों की तरफ से भारी निगरानी**.

अनुच्छेद स्पष्ट रूप से बताता है कि राज्य अधिकारी अक्सर कांग्रेस के कार्यों को लागू करने में सहयोगी नहीं थे। इसका मतलब यह है कि राज्य अधिकारियों की निगरानी एक मुद्दा था, लेकिन यह कानून लागू करने में समस्या का *कारण* था, न कि एक आवश्यक मुद्दा जिससे राज्यों को निपटना पड़ा। 

अन्य विकल्प अनुच्छेद में सीधे तौर पर बताए गए आवश्यक मुद्दे हैं:

*   **B: कांग्रेस के अंदर शक्ति की कमी:** अनुच्छेद बताता है कि कांग्रेस के पास कर लगाने का अधिकार नहीं था और कोई राष्ट्रीय कार्यकारी या न्यायपालिका नहीं थी।
*   **C: वे संशोधन जिनके लिए सभी की रज़ामंदी की ज़रूरत है:** अनुच्छेद में कहा गया है कि संशोधनों के लिए सभी राज्यों की सर्वसम्मति की आवश्यकता थी।
*   **D: अस्तित्वहीन राष्ट्रीय कार्यकारी:** अनुच्छेद बताता है कि कोई राष्ट्रीय कार्यकारी नहीं था, जो कांग्रेस को कमजोर करता था।

इसलिए, राज्य अधिकारियों की निगरानी एकमात्र विकल्प है जो कानून लागू करने की कोशिश करते समय राज्यों के लिए एक आवश्यक मुद्दा *नहीं* था।"
"Pasaage ke hisab se, krantikari yuddh ke dauran, inmein se kaunsi baat kendra sarkaar ki haalat par sahi baithti hai?","सही उत्तर **C: राajyon ke pratinidhi ke maujoodgi ki kami rahi** है।

**कारण:**

अनुच्छेद स्पष्ट रूप से बताता है कि ""राज्योंने केंद्र सरकार को गंभीरता से नहीं लिया और उनके प्रतिनिधि अक्सर सभा में आते ही नहीं थे।"" यह सीधे तौर पर प्रतिनिधियों की अनुपस्थिति की समस्या को इंगित करता है, जो केंद्र सरकार को कमजोर कर रही थी।

अन्य विकल्प गलत क्यों हैं:

*   **A: Congress aur rajya adhikaariyon ne karon ko laagoo kiya tha** - अनुच्छेद कहता है कि कांग्रेस के पास कर लगाने का अधिकार *नहीं* था।
*   **B: Congress ke adhikaar se tay hona tha ki sanshodhan karna hain ya nahi** - अनुच्छेद बताता है कि संशोधनों के लिए *सभी* राज्यों की सर्वसम्मति की आवश्यकता थी, न कि केवल कांग्रेस के निर्णय से।
*   **D: Kendriya sarkar mein do mukhya ghatak the** - अनुच्छेद स्पष्ट रूप से कहता है कि केंद्र सरकार में केवल एक घटक था: कांग्रेस।"
Swatantrata ke mool ghoshna ke pichhe kaise shabd likhe gaye hain?,"The correct answer is **C: Ulte**.

The passage states: """"paath dastaavez ke tall par dikhai deta hai, ulta."""" which translates to ""The text appears on the back of the document, reversed.""

Therefore, the words written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are written in reverse."
Singapore inmein se kiske liye mashhoor hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shaharee hariyaalee (Urban greenery)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Singapore started as a heavily vegetated island and was transformed into a tropical garden city. It also mentions the national flower, emphasizing the importance of flora. This all points to Singapore being famous for its urban greenery.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Hiking:** While Singapore has some hiking trails, it isn't primarily known for hiking.
*   **C: Adventure sports:** Singapore offers some adventure sports, but it's not a major destination for them.
*   **D: Pradarshan kala (Performing arts):** Singapore has a growing arts scene, but it's not its defining characteristic.



"
Vanda Miss Joaquim kya hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Ek phool** (A flower).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""1981 mein, advance kism ke arched hybrid **vanda mis joakim** ko desh ke rashtriya **fool** ke roop mein chuna gaya tha."" (In 1981, an advanced breed of arched hybrid **Vanda Miss Joaquim** was chosen as the national **flower** of the country).

Therefore, Vanda Miss Joaquim is a type of flower.

"Passage ke hisab se, Giza pyramids ki kis gunavatta se, Naye saamraajy ke misravaasiyon ke hairan hone ki ummeed nahi thi?","Sahi jawab hai **A: Unki umr**.

Passage mein kaha gaya hai ki Nyu Kingdom ke misravaasi apne purvavartiyon ke smarakon se ""aashcharyachakit the, jo tab ek hazaar varsh se adhik puraane the."" Isse pata chalta hai ki unhe yeh baat hairan karne wali lagi ki pyramid kitne purane the.

Baaki options passage mein is tarah se nahi bataye gaye hain:

*   **Patthar ka istemaal:** Passage mein patthar ke istemaal ke bare mein kuch nahi kaha gaya hai.
*   **Unka aakaar:** Passage mein yeh kaha gaya hai ki Giza ke pyramid ka aakar utkrishth tha, lekin yeh nahi kaha gaya ki Nyu Kingdom ke misravaasi is aakar se hairan the.
*   **Unki banawat:** Passage mein unke nirmaan ke technique ki utkrishtata ka zikr hai, lekin yeh nahi kaha gaya ki Nyu Kingdom ke misravaasi isse hairan the."
"Passage ke hisab se, shakahari jeev khaane ki talaash mein kahan aate hain?","The correct answer is **C: Dakshini maidaan (Southern plains)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...lagbhag 1.5 million shakahari jeev-jantu barish ke liye uttari pahaadiyonse hote hue, maaraa nadee ko paar karke **dakshini maidanon ke or jaate hain**.""  This translates to ""approximately 1.5 million herbivorous animals, passing through the northern hills for the rains, cross the Maraa River and go towards the **southern plains**.""

Therefore, the passage clearly indicates they are moving *to* the southern plains in search of food (implied by the mention of the rains and migration).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pashchimee maidaan (Western plains):** The passage mentions crossing the Maraa River, but doesn't directly state they end up in the western plains.
*   **B: Uttaree pahaadiyaan (Northern hills):** They *start* from the northern hills, but don't stay there; they migrate away.
*   **D: Pashchimee pahaadiyaan (Western hills):**  The passage does not mention any western hills.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, shaakaahaaree praanee April ke aaspaas kis kshetra ko chhod dete hain?","The passage states the herbivores *migrate to* the southern plains around October. It doesn't say where they *leave from* in April. However, the migration described is a cycle – they move from the northern hills to the southern plains, then *back* across the Mara River.  Therefore, the logical starting point before heading south in October would be the northern hills. The Serengeti ecosystem includes the areas they migrate *through* (Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Maswa Game Reserve, and Masai Mara National Reserve), but doesn't specify a place they *leave* from in April.

Given the options, the best answer is **A: Serengeti kshetra** because it's the larger region encompassing the starting point of their migration. While the passage doesn't explicitly say they *leave* the Serengeti in April, it's the most likely place they would be before migrating south towards October.



"
Operation Sealion mein kis desh par hamla kiya gaya tha?,"The correct answer is **B: Britain**.

The text states: ""Germany ne britten ke dweep par aakraman karne ke liye taiyar hona shuru kar diya tha"" which translates to ""Germany had begun preparing to invade the island of Britain"".  It then specifically names the operation to do so as ""Operation Sealion"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Germany** - Germany was *launching* the attack, not the target of it.
* **C: France** - The text mentions France in relation to a previous conflict, but Operation Sealion was directed at Britain.
* **D: Poland** - Poland was involved in earlier conflicts with Germany, but not Operation Sealion.



"
Britain par kiye gaye hamle ko Germany ne kya naam diya tha?,"The correct answer is **B: Operation Sealion**.

The text explicitly states: ""Germany ne is hamale ko """"operation sealian"""" naam diya."" (Germany named this attack ""Operation Sealion"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dunkirk** - Dunkirk was a *location* where British troops were evacuated, not the name of the planned invasion.
*   **C: Kriegsmarine** - Kriegsmarine is the name of the German Navy.
*   **D: Royal Navy** - Royal Navy is the name of the British Navy.



"
Africa ke desho par qabza karne ke Italy ki yojna mein inmein se kis cheez ko zaroori step ke taur par nahi bataya gaya hai?,"Sahi jawab hai **C: Sena ki tukdiyon ke liye launching pad ki sthaapana**.

Gaya hua passage mein Africa par kabza karne ki Italy ki yojana mein yeh bataya gaya hai ki unhein bhoomadhya sagar ko paar karna hai, misr mein British thikano aur jahaazon se chhutkara pana hai, aur unke yuddh ke jahaazon ko kuch aur nahi karna hai. Ismein sena ki tukdiyon ke liye launching pad sthaapana ka zikr nahi kiya gaya hai.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Egypt mein jahaazon se chhutkara pana:** Passage mein saaf-saaf bataya gaya hai ki misr mein British jahaazon se chhutkara pana zaroori hai.
*   **B: Atirikt jahaaz banana:** Italy ne yuddh ke shuruatse thik pehle chaar naye jahaazon ka nirmaan kiya tha, jo yojana ka hissa tha.
*   **D: British thikano ko barbaad karna:** misr mein British thikano ko barbaad karna bhi yojana ka ek hissa tha."
"Passage ke hisab se, Italy ke yuddha ka mukhya uddeshya kya mana gaya tha?","The correct answer is **A: Africa ke deshon par qabza karna**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Italy ka mukhya lakshya african desh the. Un deshon par kabza karne ke liye..."" (Italy's main goal was African countries. To capture those countries...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Zyada mazboot sena aur nausena banana** - The passage states Italy *had* a weak army and navy, and doesn't mention a goal of strengthening them as a primary objective.
* **C: Egypt mein jahaazon se chhutkara pana** - While getting rid of British ships in Egypt was a *step* towards their goal, it wasn't the goal itself.
* **D: British thikane banana** - Italy wanted to eliminate British bases, not build them.



"
Hamla karne walo ke saath kisne dostana rishte banaye?,"The correct answer is **B: Vichy French**.

The passage explicitly states: ""ye francici log hi the jinhone 1940 mein Germans ke saath shanti asthaapit ki thi aur aakramankariyon se ladne ke bajaay unke saath kam kiya tha.""  This directly refers to the Vichy French collaborating with the Germans.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: German:** The passage states the Vichy French made peace *with* the Germans, not the other way around.
* **C: Americans:** The Americans *fought against* the Vichy French (and Germans) in Operation Dragon.
* **D: Free French:** The Free French *fought alongside* the Americans to liberate Southern France.



"
Operation Dragoon mein shaamil sahayogi kaun the?,"The correct answer is **A: Americans and Free French**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kewal do hafton mein amerikiyon aur free French balon ne dakshini Fraance ko mukt kar diya tha..."" (Only in two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated Southern France...).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Vichy French and Americans:** The text describes the Vichy French as the ones *being liberated from*, not as participants in the operation.
*   **C: Germans and French:** The operation was *against* the Germans.
*   **D: Americans and Germans:** The operation was *against* the Germans.



"
Kis technology ke vikaas ki wajah se panadubbiyan paani ke niche yaatra karane lagi?,"The correct answer is **D: Radar**.

The passage states: ""Jaise-jaise radar viksit hone lagey aur zyada steak hote gaye, pandubbiyon ko dikhanese bachane ke liye paani ke niche jaane ke liye mazboor hona padaa."" This directly translates to ""As radar developed and became more effective, submarines were forced to go underwater to avoid detection.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: You-boat:** This is what the Germans called their submarines, not a technology that caused them to submerge.
*   **B: Nishaanaabaazee kee seema (shooting range):** While the passage mentions limited shooting range, it doesn't connect that to the reason for submarines going underwater.
*   **C: Maargadarshan (navigation):** Navigation is important for submarines, but not the reason they started submerging.



"
"Pehli baar istemaal karne ke dauran, panadubbiyaon ki kabiliyat kin cheezon mein sabse kam thi?","The correct answer is **C: Nishaanaabaazee mein** (in shooting/aiming).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""...tab unaki raftar kafee dhimi aur **shooting range bhi bahut kafee seemit hua karti thi**.""  This translates to ""...their speed was quite slow and their **shooting range was also very limited**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maargadarshan karne mein** (in navigation): The text mentions they became *forced* to submerge to avoid radar, implying navigation was possible, just needing adaptation.
*   **B: Yatra karne mein** (in travel): While the text mentions speed was slow, it doesn't indicate an inability to travel.
*   **D: Sanchalan mein** (in operation/handling): The text highlights Germany's *skill* in operating and navigating submarines, so this isn't a weakness.

Therefore, the text directly points to limited shooting range as a key weakness of early submarines."
"Passage ke hisab se, kisne agreement ka ullanghan kiya? ","Correct answer is **D: Soviet ne**.

The passage explicitly states that the Soviet Union violated the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements by invading Poland. Therefore, the Soviet Union is the one who broke the agreements."
Inmein se kaunsa kaam Red Army ne nahi kiya tha?,"Correct answer is **C: Bridgehead ke saath reorganization**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Polish army *planned* to regroup with the Romanian bridgehead. It does **not** say the Red Army did the reorganizing with the bridgehead. 

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the passage:

*   **A: Ukraine ka morcha banana:** The passage explicitly states the Red Army ""khade kar diye Belarus aur ukraini morche"" (established Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts).
*   **B: Poorvi kshetron par hamla:** The passage states the Red Army ""polland ke purvi kshetron par hamla karne ke baad pravesh karte hue"" (after attacking Poland's eastern territories).
*   **D: Sandhi ka ullanghan:** The passage says they violated ""riga shanti sandhi, the soviyat-polish non-aggression pact aur anya antar rashtriya dwipakshiya aur bahupakshiya dono tarah ke sandhiyon"" (Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international bilateral and multilateral treaties).



"
Italian Tenth Army ke Engineer-in-Chief ko kya hua tha?,"The correct answer is **C: Unhein British ne pakad liya tha**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Baradia ke poorv mein ek ghaatak jagah par, angrezonne dasavin italian sena ke engineer-inn-chief, general lastuci ko pakad lia tha.""  This directly translates to ""In a dangerous place east of Bardia, the British captured the Engineer-in-Chief of the Tenth Italian Army, General Lastuci.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Unhein Fort Capuzzo mein pakad liya gaya:** While the text mentions Fort Capuzzo being captured, it doesn't state Lastuci was captured *at* the fort. He was captured in a dangerous area near Bardia.
*   **B: Unhein Tobruk mein maar diya gaya:** Marshal Balbo was killed in Tobruk, not General Lastuci.
*   **D: Veh ek friendly fire mein maare gaye the:** This describes Balbo's death, not Lastuci's fate.



"
Italo Balbo ko kahan mara gaya tha?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk**.

The text states: ""28 june ko, libia ke governor general aur marshal musolini ke spasht uttaradhikari marshal italo balbo, **tobruk** mein land karte samay friendly fire mein maare gaye."" (On June 28th, the Governor General of Libya and Marshal Mussolini's clear successor, Marshal Italo Balbo, was killed by friendly fire while landing in **Tobruk**.)



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inmein se kaunsi takneek, Tibetan meditation ke zaroori hissa hain?","The correct answer is **C: Devtaon ki kalpana karna** (Imagining deities).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Daiv yoga tibbati dhyan ka kendra hai. alag-alag devtaon ke chitranse oorjaa channels ko saaf kiya jaataa hai, chakron ko sakriya kiya jaataa aur aatmagyaan chetna ka nirmaan kiya jaataa hai.""  This translates to: ""Divine Yoga is the center of Tibetan meditation. Through the images of various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and self-knowledge consciousness is built.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Saans lene ke vyaayaam ka abhyaas karna** (Practicing breathing exercises) - While breathing exercises *are* mentioned in relation to Kundalini Yoga, they aren't specifically tied to Tibetan meditation (Daiv Yoga) in the passage.
*   **B: Mantra dohrana** (Repeating mantras) -  Mantras are mentioned with Kundalini Yoga, not Tibetan meditation directly.
*   **D: Yog mudraon mein mahaarat haasil karana** (Mastering yoga mudras) - Similar to breathing exercises and mantras, mudras relate to Kundalini Yoga, not specifically Tibetan meditation.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Tibetan meditation ke “center” ke dauran chakras kaise sakriya hote hain?","The correct answer is **B: Devtaon ki kalpna karke** (By visualizing deities).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Daiv yoga tibbati dhyan ka kendra hai. alag-alag devtaon ke chitranse oorjaa channels ko saaf kiya jaataa hai, **chakron ko sakriya kiya jaataa hai** aur aatmagyaan chetna ka nirmaan kiya jaataa hai."" 

This translates to: ""Divine yoga is the center of Tibetan meditation. Energy channels are cleared by visualizations of various deities, **chakras are activated**, and self-knowledge consciousness is built.""

The passage explicitly links chakra activation to the visualization of deities. The other options are mentioned as part of Kundalini Yoga, not specifically Daiv Yoga (the center of Tibetan meditation).



"
Program ke dauran doosra bhakti geet kisne sunaya?,"The correct answer is **D: Jai Shankar Choudhary**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gaayak sanju sharmane sham ke shuruat ke, **uske baad jaya shankar chaudharine chhappan bhog bhajan bhi gaya**, gaayak, raju khandelwalne unka saath diya."" 

This translates to: ""Singer Sanju Sharma started the evening, **after that Jai Shankar Choudhary also sang a Chhappan Bhog bhajan**, singer Raju Khandelwal accompanied him.""

Therefore, Jai Shankar Choudhary was the second singer to perform a devotional song (Chhappan Bhog bhajan) during the program.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, khana kilate samay kisne bhakti sunaya?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Baba Shyam ko chhappan bhog (hindu dharm mein, 56 alag-alag khaadya padaarth, jaise, mithaai, full, meva, vyanjan aadi jo devta ko chadhaae jaate hain) ke 108 thali parosi gaeen. Lakkha singhne chhappan bhog bhajan bhi prastut kiya. gaayak, raju khandelwal unke saath the."" 

This clearly indicates that Lakkha Singh sang a *bhajan* (devotional song) while the *chhappan bhog* was being offered.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jai Shankar Choudhary:** He sang a *chhappan bhog bhajan* earlier, but not *during* the offering of the food.
*   **C: Shri Shyam:** Shri Shyam is the deity *receiving* the offering, not singing.
*   **D: Sanju Sharma:** He sang at the beginning of the event, not during the offering of food.



"
Us raat ki second-last performance kaunsi thi?,"The correct answer is **B: Fire of Anatolia**.

Here's why:

The passage states the order of performances as follows:

1. Circ Du Soleil
2. Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra (with Faith Ercock & Muslum Gurses)
3. Whirling Dervishes
4. Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina & Harris Alexiou
5. Fire of Anatolia (""Troy"" show)

Therefore, Fire of Anatolia was the *second-to-last* performance.



"
Alessandro Safina kis desh se hain?,"The correct answer is **D: Italian**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Turkey ki gayika Sejen Aksu ne **italian Alessandro Safina** aur Greek gaayak Harris Alexey ke saath karyakram kiya."" (Turkish singer Sejen Aksu performed with **Italian Alessandro Safina** and Greek singer Harris Alexey.)
"
Passage ke aadhaar par inmein se kaunsi baat sach nahi hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Santa Clara mein aag lag gayi thi** (There was a fire in Santa Clara).

Here's why:

* **The passage states passengers were waiting in 90-degree heat.** It mentions a fire captain, but only in the context of commenting on the *heat* being like a hot day, not that there was a fire.
* **B: Log ek roller coaster par phanse hue the** (People were stuck on a roller coaster) - The passage explicitly states people were stuck on a roller coaster.
* **C: Passengers ko paani diya gaya tha** (Passengers were given water) - The passage starts by stating passengers were given water.
* **D: Pahle vyakti ko us ride se utaarne mein kam se kam 60 minute lage** (It took at least 60 minutes to get the first person off the ride) - The passage says it took *at least an hour* (60 minutes) to get the first person off.

Therefore, the only statement *not* supported by the passage is that there was a fire in Santa Clara."
"Passage ke hisab se,asuvidhaajanak taap star ke sambandh mein kisne tippani ki?","The correct answer is **B: Agni kaptaan ne (Fire captain)**.

The passage states: ""Fire captain Scott Conusne kahaa, """"90 ke dashak mein tapman ke saath santa clara mein yah ek germ din tha."""" (Fire captain Scott Conus said, """"It was a hot day in Santa Clara with temperatures in the 90s."""")

This directly indicates that the fire captain commented on the uncomfortable heat.
"
Tsunami ki gatividhi ki wajah se kahan ki bijli gul ho gayi thi?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

The text explicitly states: ""Tonga mein koi badee kshati yaa chot ke suchna nahin mili hai, lekin bijli asthaayi roop se chully gayi thi..."" (There is no information about major damage or injuries in Tonga, but the electricity was temporarily cut off...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Niue:** The text mentions tsunami activity *near* Niue, but doesn't say the power went out there.
*   **C: Hawaii mein bane school:** The schools were *closed* as a precaution, but the text doesn't say the power went out at the schools.
*   **D: Pago Pago:** Pago Pago is mentioned as a location where tsunami activity was recorded, but not where the power outage occurred.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, bijli gul hone ki wajah se Tonga par kya asar pada?","The correct answer is **B: Adhikaariyon ko, hatai gai chetavniyon ki khabar nahi mili** (Officials didn't receive news of the removed warnings).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*bijli asthaayi roop se chully gayi thi, jiske karan kathit taur par tongan adhikariyon ko ptwc dwara jaari sunami chetavani milna rook gayi thi.*"" This directly translates to ""...the electricity went out temporarily, because of which Tongan officials reportedly stopped receiving tsunami warnings issued by PTWC.""  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Thode nuksan ki soochna mili thi** (Some damage was reported) - The passage says there was *no* report of major damage or injury.
*   **C: Samudra star ki readings par asar hua tha** (The sea level readings were affected) -  The sea level readings *indicated* the tsunami, but the electricity outage affected the officials receiving information about it.
*   **D: Adhikaariyon ko zaroori chetavniayn nahi mili thi** (Officials didn't receive important warnings) - While true, this is a general statement. The passage *specifically* says they didn’t receive news of the *removed* warnings. Option B is more precise to what the passage states.



"
Jonny Reid ki driving speed ko maapne ke liye police ne apni radar gun ka istemaal kab kiya?,"The correct answer is **A: Jab veh 160km/h ki speed se gaadi chala raha tha**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""police unaki raftar sirya tabhi map sucky, jab way rtaar kam karke 160 kilometres/ghantase par aa gaye the."" This translates to ""police could only measure his speed when he reduced it to 160 kilometers/hour.""  This means they used the radar gun *at* 160 km/h, not before or during faster speeds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jab veh saantvi baar pull par aaya** - The passage doesn't mention *when* they tried to measure the speed, only *at what speed* they could.
*   **C: Jab veh160km/h se zyada ki speed par gaadi chala raha tha** - The passage specifically says they *couldn't* get a reading at higher speeds.
*   **D: Jab veh pehli baar pull par aaya** - There's no mention of when the police first attempted to measure the speed."
"Passage ke hisab se, New Zealand police ke liye Jonny Reid ki speed par nazar rakhna mushkil kyun tha?","Correct answer is **B: Car bahut neechi thi**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Blek Beauty ke chhote aakar ke vajah se newland ke police ko speed radar gana ka istemal karke shree reed ke rtaar pata lagaane mein kathinaaee ho rahi thi."" This directly translates to: ""Because of Black Beauty's small size, the New Zealand police were having difficulty using speed radar guns to detect Mr. Reid's speed.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Veh 160km/h ki speed se gaadi chala raha tha:** While he *was* going fast, the passage says the police had trouble detecting the speed, not that the speed itself was the problem.
*   **C: Usne sirf saat bar pull paar kiya:** The number of times he crossed the bridge isn't related to the difficulty in tracking his speed.
*   **D: Auckland Harbour Bridge bahut purana hai:** The bridge's age isn't mentioned as a reason for the police's difficulties.



"
Butte sa juda bhookamp kahaan kendrit tha?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 meel dakshin mein** (40 miles south).

The passage states the earthquake was centered approximately 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of Butte."
Abu Ghraib mein dange ke dauran kya hua?,"The correct answer is **C: US ki sena ne niyantran le liya** (US military took control).

Here's why:

The passage states that after the abuse of prisoners was discovered, the US military took responsibility for the jail. This directly addresses what happened *after* the riot. While abuse (A) was the *reason* for the subsequent action, it wasn't what happened *during* the riot itself.  Options B and D aren't mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.



"
Iraq ki jail kis wajah se badnaam hui? ,"The correct answer is **D: Qaidiyon ke saath badtameezi ki jaankaari mili** (Information about mistreatment of prisoners was revealed).

Here's why:

The passage states that Abu Ghraib jail became notorious *after* the revelation of prisoner abuse. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ismein aag lagaa di gai thi** (It was set on fire) - The passage doesn't mention a fire.
*   **B: US ki sena ne niyantran le liya tha** (The US army took control) - While the US army did take control, that wasn't *why* the jail became infamous. It happened *after* the abuse came to light.
*   **C: Wahan kai dange hue** (There were many riots there) - The passage mentions unrest (""dange ke dauran""), but the infamy came specifically from the abuse, not just the unrest itself.



"
Maui ke War Memorial Stadium mein kis tarah ka aayojan hone wala tha?,"The correct answer is **C: Sangeet samaaroh** (Music concert).

Here's why:

The passage states that 9,000 *people were going to attend* the show. This, combined with the mention of a ""band"" and their ""management company"", clearly indicates it was a music concert (sangeet samaaroh).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jaadoo ka show** (Magic show) - No mention of magic or a magician.
*   **B: Football match** (Football match) - No mention of football or a sports event.
*   **D: Fundraiser** (Fundraiser) - While a concert *could* be a fundraiser, the passage doesn't indicate that was the purpose. It focuses on the band and attendance.



"
"Aakhir mein, aayojan ke cancel hone ke sambandh mein kisne safayi di?","The correct answer is **B: Prabandhan company ne** (The management company).

Here's why:

The text states that HK management incorporation (the band's management company) initially didn't give a reason for the cancellation, and *then* the next day attributed it to preparation reasons. This means they ultimately provided the explanation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Band ne** (The band) - While the band apologized, they didn't explain *why* the show was cancelled.
*   **C: War Memorial Stadium ke maalik ne** (The owner of War Memorial Stadium) - The stadium owner isn't mentioned as providing an explanation.
*   **D: Prashansako ne** (The fans) - Fans received the apology but didn't provide clarification.



"
Bishkek ke kuchh nivaasiyon ne lootpaat ke liye kise zimmedaar thehraya?,"The correct answer is **C: Pradarshanakaariyon ko (Protesters)**.

The text states: ""kayee bishkek nivaasiyonne dakshin ke pradarshankariyon ko is arajakata ke liye doshi thaharaaya"" which translates to ""many Bishkek residents blamed the southern protesters for this unrest.""

Therefore, the residents blamed the protesters for the looting."
Lootpaat ke liye dakshin ke pradarshanakaariyon ko kisne zimmedaar mana?,"The correct answer is **A: Bishkek ke nivaasiyon ne** (Bishkek residents).

The passage explicitly states: ""kayee bishkek nivaasiyonne dakshin ke pradarshankariyon ko is arajakata ke liye doshi thaharaaya"" - which translates to ""many Bishkek residents blamed the southern protesters for this chaos.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Qanoon laagoo karne waale adhikaariyon ko** (Law enforcement officials) - The passage states they *weren't present*, so they couldn't be blaming anyone.
* **C: ArajakatavadI** (Anarchists) - While the passage mentions unrest, it doesn't say anarchists are doing the blaming.
* **D: Logo ke giroh ko** (Crowds of people) - The crowds are *doing* the looting, not blaming anyone *for* it.



"
Ring anubhav se bikree kab badhi?,"The correct answer is **A: Shark Tank par upasthiti ke baad** (After appearing on Shark Tank).

The passage specifically states: ""Siminoffne kahaa ki 2013 mein shark tank episode mein unke dikhane ke baad bikri mein badhotari hui"" which translates to ""Siminoff said that sales increased after his appearance on the Shark Tank episode in 2013.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 2013 mein funding haasil karne ke baad** (After receiving funding in 2013) - The passage states the Shark Tank panel *didn't* invest, so they didn't receive funding *from them* at that time.
* **C: QVC par upasthiti ke baad** (After appearing on QVC) - The passage simply states he appeared on QVC in 2017, it doesn't say sales increased because of it.
* **D: ADT ke saath mukadma nipataane ke baad** (After filing a lawsuit against ADT) -  The passage mentions a lawsuit, but doesn't link it to an increase in sales.



"
Jamie Siminoff ne Ring shuru karne ka faisla kab liya?,"The correct answer is **A: Yeh mehsoos karne ke baad ki unki khud ki doorbell aparyaapt thi** (After realizing his own doorbell was inadequate).

The passage states Ring started because he couldn't hear the doorbell from the store. This directly indicates the reason for starting the company.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shark Tank mein asafal upasthiti ke baad** (After an unsuccessful appearance on Shark Tank) - While Shark Tank *increased* sales later, it wasn't the initial reason for starting the company.
* **C: Funding haasil karne ke baad** (After securing funding) - The passage doesn't suggest funding came *before* the idea.
* **D: QVC par safal upasthiti ke baad** (After a successful appearance on QVC) - QVC was much later in the company's history.

Reading Rainbow ke har episode mein bachchon ko kis cheez ka sujhaav diya gaya tha?,"The correct answer is **D: Kitabon ka** (Books).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""har show mein kuch kitaabon ke baare mein salah bhi dee jaayegi. bachchon ko apni library mein jaakar yekitaaben padhani chaahiye.""  This directly translates to ""Each show will also give suggestions about some books. Children should go to their library and read some books.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Television dharavahiko ka** (Television series) - The show *is* a television series, but doesn't suggest others to watch.
*   **B: Sthaaniya pustakalay ka** (Local library) - While the show encourages visiting the library, it's to *read books* there, not just to suggest the library itself.
*   **C: Themes ka** (Themes) - The show explores themes, but the direct suggestion is about *books* related to those themes.



"
Reading Rainbow series ke cancel hone ki kya wajah rahi hogi?,"The correct answer is **A: Aparyaapt funding**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**John Grant sahit kuch logon ka manna hai ki funding ke kami...donone is shrinkhala ko samaapt karne mein yogdan diya hai.**"" (John Grant and some others believe that lack of funding... contributed to the cancellation of this series.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Emmy awards ki kami:** The passage mentions the show *has* won many awards, so a lack of them isn't the reason for cancellation.
* **C: John Grant ki raay:** While John Grant *expressed* an opinion on the reason, the passage states funding *along with* changes in educational TV were factors.  His opinion isn't the sole reason.
* **D: Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood ki safalta:** The passage states *Reading Rainbow* aired *after* *Sesame Street* and *Mister Rogers' Neighborhood*, but doesn't suggest their success caused *Reading Rainbow* to be cancelled.



"
Ped ke sambandh mein Amsterdam aur museum ke adhikaariyon ne inmein se kaun si baat nahi kahi thi?,"सही उत्तर है **A: Pakka hai ki yeh gir hi jayega**।

टेक्स्ट में कहा गया है कि पेड़ गिरने का ""पूरा खतरा"" था, लेकिन यह नहीं कहा गया कि यह ""निश्चित रूप से"" गिर जाएगा। अन्य सभी विकल्प टेक्स्ट में बताए गए हैं:

*   **B: Ise sanrakshit karna chahiye** - पेड़ को बचाने के लिए आपातकालीन अदालत में गया गया।
*   **C: Ismein pahphoond lagi hui hai** - टेक्स्ट में कहा गया है कि पेड़ संक्रमित है।
*   **D: Yeh sarvajanik svasthy ke liye khatarnaak hai** - टेक्स्ट में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि पेड़ सार्वजनिक स्वास्थ्य के लिए खतरा है।

इसलिए, विकल्प A वह बात है जो नीदरलैंड के अधिकारियों ने नहीं कही थी।"
"RSPCA ke mukhy nirikshak ke hisab se, inmein se kiske liye, nireekshan ka manak bana dena chahiye?","The correct answer is **B: Janwaron ke saath kaam kar raha koi bhi vyakti** (Anyone working with animals).

Here's why:

The passage states David O'Shannessy said CCTV would ""definitely... give a strong signal to people *looking after animals* that their welfare is the top priority.""  He's not saying it's about monitoring the cameras themselves, or specifically the slaughterhouses, but about changing the *behavior of the people caring for the animals*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: CCTV cameras:** While CCTV is the *tool* being proposed, it's not what needs a standard of oversight.
*   **C: Surveillance installations:** This is too broad.
*   **D: Qasaikhaane:** The passage mentions slaughterhouses as the *location* where this is being proposed, but the focus of the oversight is on the people working *within* those locations.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Australia ke qasaikhaano ke shramiko ke liye, pashu kalyaan ki zaroorat ko mazbooti dene mein kya cheez madad kar sakti hai?","The correct answer is **A: CCTV cameras ka installation**.

Here's why:

The passage directly states that David O'Shonnessy believes CCTV cameras ""will definitely send a strong signal to those handling animals that their welfare is the top priority."" This means the installation of CCTV cameras will reinforce the importance of animal welfare for workers in Australian slaughterhouses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: RSPCA ke saath zaroori meetings:** The passage mentions the RSPCA *advocating* for CCTV, but doesn't say meetings with them would reinforce the need for welfare.
* **C: Qasaikhaano ke niyamit nirikshan:** While the passage mentions the need for regular monitoring and inspection, it specifically highlights CCTV as the tool to *signal* the importance of welfare.
* **D: ABC se nirikshan:** ABC is mentioned only as the news outlet reporting the story, not as something that would influence worker behavior.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, jis vyakti ko giraftar kiya gaya hai vah kya kaam karta hai?","The correct answer is **A: Chaatr** (Student).

Here's why:

The passage states ""ki ek any chhaatr ko 21 march ke school mein golibari ke silsile mein giraftar kiya gaya hai"" which translates to ""that another **student** was arrested in connection with the March 21 school shooting.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Miniapolis star-tribune ke sath ek journalist** - The passage mentions a source *to* the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, but doesn't say the arrested person is a journalist.
*   **C: Tribal ke adhyaksh** - While the passage identifies the arrested individual as the son of the tribal president, it doesn't state that *he* is the president.
*   **D: Raid lake ka koi adhikari** - The passage does not indicate the arrested person is an official of Raid Lake.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, jab ek aur giraftari ki khabar fail rahi thi, tab kitne logo ka antim sanskar kiya ja raha tha?","The correct answer is **B: Teen**.

The passage states: ""Jeff weas aur nau peediton mein se **teen** ka antim sanskar karte samay, aaj raid lake samudaay mein yekhabar fail gayi ki ek any chhaatr ko..."" 

This translates to: ""While performing the last rites of **three** out of the nine victims, news spread today in the Red Lake community that another student was...""

Therefore, the passage clearly states three people were being mourned when news of the arrest broke."
"Dharane ke virodh mein, kaunsa desh ACTA samjhaute par hastakshar karne ke lie aage nahi aaya?","The correct answer is **B: Poland**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""pichle mahine polland mein badey virodh pradarshan hue the jabus deshne acta par hastakshar kiye the, jiske karan polland ke sarkarne is samjhaute abhi manjur nahin karne ka faisala kiya hai.""  This directly translates to ""Last month, large protests took place in Poland after signing the ACTA, causing the Polish government to decide not to ratify the agreement yet.""

This means Poland *signed* ACTA but then *decided not to ratify* it due to protests - therefore, they haven't fully committed to it. The question asks which country didn't come forward to *sign* ACTA, and Poland is the only one mentioned as having hesitated after signing due to public pressure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **Germany:** The text states protests happened *in* Germany (Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg, Hanover) but doesn't say they didn't sign ACTA.
*   **Scotland:** Protests occurred in Scotland (Edinburgh and Glasgow), but it doesn't imply Scotland is a signatory or refused to sign.
*   **Lithuania:** Protests happened in Lithuania (Vilnius), but again, nothing about them refusing to sign.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kaunse desh ne ACTA samjhaute ko manjur nahin karne ka faisala kiya hai?","The correct answer is **D: Latvia**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Poland ke sarkarne is samjhaute abhi manjur nahin karne ka faisala kiya hai."" (Poland's government has decided not to ratify the agreement yet.) It also says, ""Latavia aur slovakia donone acta mein shamil hone ke prakriya mein deree ke."" (Latvia and Slovakia are both delaying the process of joining the act.) This implies Latvia hasn't approved it yet.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Estonia:** The passage mentions protests in Tallinn (Estonia), but doesn't say they rejected ACTA.
*   **Lithuania:** The passage mentions protests in Vilnius (Lithuania), but doesn't say they rejected ACTA.
*   **Scotland:** The passage mentions protests in Edinburgh and Glasgow (Scotland), but doesn't say they rejected ACTA.



"
iPod overheatig ki ghatna ki vajah se kull kitne logo chhote aayin?,"The correct answer is **C: 6**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ipod overheating mein kharabi ke lagbhag 60 mamle samne aye hain, jisase **cull chhah baar aug luggy** aur chaar log mamuli roop se jall gaye.""  (Approximately 60 cases of iPod overheating have come to light, resulting in **six people being injured** and four people suffering minor burns.)

Therefore, 6 people were injured due to the iPod overheating incidents."
Yah kisne kaha ki overheating ki ghatnayein zyaada gambhir nahin hain?,"The correct answer is **D: Apple**.

The text states: ""pichle hafte, metine ghoshana ke ki applene 34 overheating ke mamle samne aye hai , jise companyne gambhirtase nahin lia."" This translates to ""Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 cases of overheating, which the company did not take seriously.""

Therefore, Apple is the one who didn't consider the overheating incidents to be serious. METI criticized Apple *for* not taking it seriously.



"
"Apne bhashan ke dauran, Steve Jobs ne Apple ke kis product ka phir se aavishkar karne ki baat ki?","The correct answer is **B: Phone**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states Steve Jobs said, ""aaj aipal apne **phone** ka phir aavishkar karne jaa raha hai"" (today Apple is going to reinvent its **phone**). 

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ithihas (History)** - While he said they were *making* history, he wasn't reinventing it.
*   **C: Company** - He spoke about reinventing a *product* of the company, not the company itself.
*   **D: Technology** - Although the phone relies on technology, he specifically mentioned the *phone*.



"
Steve Jobs ke do ghante ke bhashan ka maksad kya tha?,"The correct answer is **C: Naya phone launch karna**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states Steve Jobs said, """"aaj aipal apne phone ka phir aavishkar karne jaa raha hai, aaj hum itihas banaane ja rahe hain."" (today Apple is going to reinvent its phone, today we are going to make history). This clearly indicates the purpose of his speech was to launch a new phone.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Naya tablet launch karna** - The passage doesn't mention a tablet.
*   **B: Naya computer launch karna** - The passage doesn't mention a computer.
*   **D: Apni retirement ki ghoshana karna** - The passage doesn't mention retirement."
Argentine theatre mein Christina Fernandes die Kirchnerne ne kya ghoshana ke?,"The correct answer is **A: Apne rashtrapati pada ke ummidwari ke ghoshana ke** (She announced her candidacy for the presidency).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Shrimati kirchnerne argentine theatre mein rashtrapati ke daud mein shamil hone ke ghoshana ke"" which translates to ""Mrs. Kirchner announced her entry into the presidential race in the Argentine theatre.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Apne Senate ke chunav ladne ke irade ke** (Her intention to contest the Senate elections) - While the passage mentions her previous Senate campaign, the announcement *in the Argentine Theatre* was about the presidency.
* **C: Buenous ires praant ke pratinidhimandal ke lie apne abhiyaan ke** (Her campaign for the Buenos Aires province delegation) - This is a past event mentioned as context, not the current announcement.
* **D: Maujooda senator ke apne pada ko tyaagne ke plan ke** (The current senator's plan to resign from her position) - The passage does not mention anything about resigning.



"
Christina fernandes die kirchnerne ne kis jagah par apne chunaw ladne ke ghoshana ke?,"The correct answer is **C: Buenos ires se 31 meel dur Argentine Theatre mein**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shrimati kirchnerne argentine theatre mein rashtrapati ke daud mein shamil hone ke ghoshana ke..."" This translates to ""Mrs. Kirchner announced her presidential candidacy in the Argentine Theatre..."" and also specifies it was ""50 kilometres (31 meal) door shahar lae plata mein apne rashtrapati pada ke ummidwari ke ghoshana ke"" which means 31 miles from La Plata, placing it near Buenos Aires.
"
Big brother ke bare mein ACMA ko kya pata chala?,"The correct answer is **A: Unhone Censorship kanoonon ka ulanghan nahi kiya tha**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ACMA yah bhi paya ki...big brotherne online content censorship kanoonon ka ulanghan nahin kiya tha..."" (ACMA also found that...Big Brother had not violated the online content censorship laws...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Media ko big brother ki website par store kiya gaya tha** - The passage specifically states the *opposite* – the media was *not* stored on Big Brother's website, which is why the law didn't apply.
*   **C: Censorship kanoonon ka ulanghan kiya gaya tha** - This directly contradicts the passage.
*   **D: Content bhautik roop se server par mila tha** - The passage explains the law requires content to be *physically* on a server to be considered a violation, and doesn't state whether it *was* found there. It focuses on the finding of *no violation*.



"
Internet content maane jaane ke liye media ko konse parameters ke under aana chahiye?,"Correct answer is **B: Ise bhautik roop se server par hona chahiye.**

The passage explicitly states that the broadcasting act applies to internet content, *however*, it requires the content to be *physically located* on a server to be considered under its control.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ise internet par stream kiya jaana chahiye** - Streaming is mentioned, but isn't the deciding factor.
*   **C: Ise kisi website pe store nahi kiya ja sakta** - The passage directly contradicts this. Big Brother *didn't* store the content on its website, but that didn't exempt it from the law *if* the content had been stored on a server.
*   **D: Ise ACMA ki taraf se approv hona chahiye** - The passage doesn't mention ACMA approval as a requirement.



"
Australia ki Liberal Party ka leader koun hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Peter Costello**.

The passage clearly states: ""Australia ke treasurer aur liberal party ke neta ke roop mein pradhaanmantri john hoard ke jagah lene waale peeter castellone..."" This translates to ""As Australia's treasurer and leader of the Liberal Party, replacing Prime Minister John Howard, Peter Costello...""

Therefore, Peter Costello is the leader of Australia's Liberal Party."
Australia mai phele se koi nuclear power industry kyon nhi hai?,"The provided text doesn't directly state *why* Australia doesn't have a nuclear power industry. However, it *implies* that the obstacle isn't technological or theoretical (Costellone says he has no ""ideological objection""). It suggests the issue is about economic viability (""when nuclear energy production becomes economically viable"").

Of the choices given, **D: Bahut mehanga hai (It is very expensive)** is the most logical inference. While the other options might be *factors* contributing to resistance, the text focuses on commercial viability.  A lack of public support (A) and it being controversial (B) would likely stem from concerns about cost and safety (C), but the core statement relates to economic feasibility.

Therefore, the best answer is **D**.



"
Kis skier ne guide ki madad se pratiyogita me hissa liya?,"The correct answer is **C: Maciej Krezel**.

The text states: ""Polland nivasi netrahin purush, **mekies crazell** aur unaki guide **ainaa augerzinskane** super-jee mukabale mein terahvaan asthan hassil kiya.""  Maciej Krezel is the Polish name mentioned with a guide, meaning he participated with assistance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Anna Jochemsen** - The text states she competed in the women's standing class, not with a guide.
*   **B: Jong Seork Park** - The text states he competed in the competition but doesn't mention a guide.
*   **D: Anna Ogarzynska** - Anna Ogarzynska is the *guide* for Maciej Krezel, not the skier.



"
Mahilaaon ki standing class ke liye super-jee mai konsa desh dasaven asthan par raha?,"The correct answer is **B: Netherlands**.

The text states: ""Way neetherland mein shamil hain, jo anna jochemsen ke saath call super-jee mein mahilaaon ke standing class mein nauvein asthan par rahaa aur finland use pratiyogita mein katja sarinan ke saath dasaven asthan par rahaa.""  This translates to: ""Among them was the Netherlands, who were ninth in the women's standing class in the super-jee with Anna Jochemsen and Finland was tenth in the competition with Katja Sarinan.""

Therefore, the Netherlands were ninth and Finland was tenth in the women's standing class super-jee. The question asks for the country in *tenth* place, so the answer is Finland.

However, the original text says that Netherlands were ninth and Finland were tenth. So, the answer should be **Finland**.

My apologies for the initial confusion. I misread the sentence structure. The correct answer is **B: Netherlands**.
"
"Passage ke hisaab se, blek ke baare mein kaunsa statement sahi nahi tha?","The correct answer is **B: Usne hamle ki baat ko sweekar karlia tha** (He confessed to the assault).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Prenenter, jise mauka-ae-vaardaatse girtaar kiya gaya tha,ne hamalese incar kiya aur daavaa kiya kiusne poll ka istemal khud ko lagbhag tees logon dwara fenke jaane waali bottlesse bachaane ke liye kiya."" This means the *presenter* (victim) accused Blek of assault and claimed to use a pole for defense. The passage **does not** say Blek admitted to the assault.  Instead, Blek was found guilty of attempting to obstruct justice *during* the trial.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Use mauka-ae-vaardaatse se giraftaar kiya gaya tha** (He was arrested from the scene of the incident) - The passage clearly states this.
* **C: Hamale ke dauraan usne pole ka istemal kiya** (He used a pole during the assault) -  The passage says the presenter used the pole, and Blek was accused of the assault.
* **D: Usne daavaa kiya ki us par bottles fenki gayi thi** (He claimed bottles were thrown at him) - While the presenter claims to have used the pole to defend *against* bottles, the passage doesn't state Blek made this claim. It’s implied he was the one bottles were thrown *at*, according to the presenter's statement.



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, Blek ke sath inmein se kya nahi hua tha?","The correct answer is **C: Us par pole se hamla kiya gaya tha** (He was attacked with a pole).

Here's why:

The passage states the *presenter* (victim) used a pole to defend themselves from bottles being thrown. It does *not* say that Blek was attacked with a pole. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Use nyay-path ko bigaadne ke prayaas ka bhi doshi paya gaya** (He was also found guilty of trying to obstruct justice) - The passage explicitly states this.
*   **B: Use girftaar kiya gaya tha** (He was arrested) - The passage states Blek was arrested at the scene.
*   **D: Use bataaya gaya tha ki uska jail jana lagbhag tay tha** (He was told his imprisonment was almost certain) - The judge told Blek this.



"
Sanyukt Rashtra Sangh ke vaishvik taapvriddhi fund ka istemaal kis kaam ke liye nahi kiya jayega?,"The correct answer is **B: Vikashil deshon mein praudyogikee lane ke lie (To bring technology to developing countries)**.

Here's why:

The text states the fund will be used for:

*   Flood-resistant houses (Baadh-rodhi gharon)
*   Better water management (Behtar jall prabandhan)
*   Crop diversification (Fasal vividhikaran)

It specifically focuses on helping countries *cope* with the effects of global warming, not necessarily bringing in new technology. While technology might *enable* these solutions, the fund isn't directly earmarked for technology acquisition. The text also mentions techniques to help developing nations move forward with *less* polluting methods, suggesting a focus on sustainable practices rather than just introducing new technology.

Therefore, bringing technology to developing nations isn't a direct use mentioned in the passage.



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, Sanyukt Rashtra Sangh kya bachaane ki ummid kar raha hai?","The correct answer is **C: Bache hue jungles ko bachaane ki** (Saving the remaining jungles).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**Baali mein is agende ke any vishayon mein duniya ke bache hue jungles ko bachaane...**"" (Among the issues on this agenda is saving the remaining jungles of the world...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Technique ko share karke paise bachaane ki** (Saving money by sharing techniques) - While the passage mentions sharing techniques, the primary goal isn't *saving money*, it's helping developing nations adopt cleaner methods.
*   **B: Fasalon ko bachaane ki** (Saving crops) - Crop diversification is *a way* to help, but not what the UN is directly hoping to save.
*   **D: Kharaab jall prabandhan se prabhavit hue logo ko bachaane ki** (Saving people affected by poor water management) - Better water management is a use of the funds, not what the UN is trying to *save*.



"
Nimnlikhit me kisko Albert Muchangane aisi chiz ke roop me maana jiske lie sehamti ki aavashykta hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Tariff riyaayatein (Tariff concessions)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Aayuktne kahaa, """"ham abhi tak mool aur tarriff riyaayaton ke niyamon par sahmat nahin hue hain..."""""", which translates to ""The Commissioner said, 'We have not yet agreed on the rules of origin and tariff concessions...'"".

This directly shows Albert Muchangane identifying tariff concessions as something agreement is *needed* on. The other options are mentioned, but not as things requiring consensus:

*   **A:** Benin joining AfCFTA is a fact that has been announced, not something requiring agreement.
*   **B:** The date trade can start is a goal (July 1, 2020), not something they're still agreeing on the rules for.
*   **C:** Rules of origin are mentioned alongside tariff concessions as something they haven't agreed on, but the question asks what *he* specifically identifies as needing agreement.



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, July se trading kyun shuru ho sakti hai?","The correct answer is **B: Niyamon aur riyayaton ka paryaapt dhancha maujood hai** (There is a sufficient framework of rules and concessions).

Here's why:

The passage directly states: """"ham abhi tak mool aur tarriff riyaayaton ke niyamon par sahmat nahin hue hain, lekin hamare paas 1 july, 2020 ko vyaapaar shuru karne ke liye paryaapt dhancha hai"""" (""We have not yet agreed on the rules and concessions of base and tariff, but we have a sufficient framework to start trading on July 1, 2020"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While Nigeria's terms *included* a July start date, the passage doesn't say *why* trading could start then, only *when* it could.
* **C:**  The AU Commissioner's approval is implied, but the passage focuses on the framework being in place.
* **D:** The passage explicitly states they haven't agreed on base rules and tariff concessions.



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, atlanta journal-constitutionne ne shiksha adhikariyon par kya aarop lagaaya?","The correct answer is **C: Aantarik samasyaon ko pahachaana par unhein thik karne ke liye kuch nahin karne ka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Report mein bataaya gaya ki test ke ank teyn gatise bay, us schoolne aantarik taur par kuch samasyaon ko pahachaana par unhein thik karne ke liye kuch nahin kiya.""  This directly translates to ""The report stated that the test scores declined, the school internally identified some problems but did nothing to fix them.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Journal-Constitution ki report ke sath ched chhad karne ka** - The passage says the Journal-Constitution *published* a report, not that the report itself was tampered with.
*   **B: Shahari shiksha mein naye tareeke apanaane mein asafal hone ka** - The passage states she was *recognized* for adopting new methods in urban education, not failing at it.
*   **D: Test ke ank kam hone ki report karna** - While they *did* report on declining test scores, the core accusation was about knowing about problems and doing nothing.



"
"Passage me di gai jaankari ke hisaab se, Dha Atlanta Journal-Constitution ki report mein kis baat ka ullekh nahi kiya gaya tha?","Sahi jawab hai **C: Saal 2013 ke national superintendent ke vijetha ki**.

Passage mein 2009 mein Beverly Hall ko national superintendent ka upadhi sammanit kiya gaya, lekin 2013 mein unpar lagaye gaye aaropon ka zikr hai. Report mein 2013 ke vijeta ka ullekh nahi hai.

Baaki vikalpon ka passage mein zikr hai:

*   **A: Anko ki asamanya taur par hui vridhi:** Report mein anko mein bade sudhaar ka zikr hai.
*   **B: Aise sabooton ki jo papers ke sath hui chedchaad ki:** Report mein test ke prashnapatron se chhedchhaad ka zikr hai.
*   **D: Shahari shiksha me naye tarike apanane ke sujhavo ki:** Passage mein unhein shahari shiksha mein naye tareeke apanaane mein pehchaan milne ka zikr hai."
"Passage ke hisab se, bumbaari ke baad inme kis baat ke baare me pata chala?","The correct answer is **D: Aadhikarik mrityu darr ki** (About the official death toll).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""kuch report aadhikarik mrityu darr aath bataati hain, aur aadhikarik reportsse pushti hoti hai ki 30 tak ghayal hue hain"" (Some reports indicate an official death toll of eight, and official reports confirm up to 30 injured). This directly tells us information about the official death toll.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ghayalon ki kul sankhya** (Total number of injured) - The passage says *up to* 30 are injured, meaning the total is not yet known.
* **B: Kin buildings ke pass bum fataa tha** (Which buildings the bombs exploded near) - The passage only says ""sarkari imaaraton ke paas"" (near government buildings) - it doesn't specify *which* government buildings.
* **C: Kisi aur bum ko bhi visfot kiya jana tha** (Whether another bomb was to be detonated) - The passage doesn't mention anything about future planned explosions.



"
Jeesas ne 2017 mein Manchester City mein shamil hone ke baad se kul kitne match khelein hain?,"The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The passage states: ""Tabse, brazilne sabhi pratiyogitaon mein club ke liye **53 matches** mein bhaag lia..."" which translates to ""Since then, Brazil has participated in **53 matches** for the club in all competitions...""

Therefore, Jeesas (Brazil) has played 53 matches since joining Manchester City in 2017."
Jeesas ko kis club se 27 million ki fees dekar apni team me shamil kiya?,"The correct answer is **A: Palmeiras**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""21 varshiya jeesas pichle saal janwari 2017 mein brazil ke club **palmyrasse** ps 27 million ke kathit fees ke liye manchester city mein shamil hue the."" 

This directly translates to: ""21-year-old Jesus joined Manchester City in January 2017 from Brazilian club **Palmeiras** for a reported fee of 27 million.""

Therefore, Manchester City bought Jesus *from* Palmeiras."
chhatrawas ke baare me inme se kaunsa kathan sahi nahi hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Adhikatar Mehman pavitra sthal se aaye the** (Most guests were from the holy place).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the guests were *mostly citizens of the United Arab Emirates* (sanyukt arab amirat ke nagrik). This directly contradicts the statement that they were mostly from the holy place (Makka).

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Mehman teeratyatra ke lie Makka me the** (The guests were in Mecca for pilgrimage) - The passage states they were pilgrims preparing for Hajj.
* **B: Kuch mehman sthaniya nagarik nahi the** (Some guests were not local citizens) -  Since they were mostly from the UAE, they were not local to Mecca.
* **C: Mehman hajj yarta ki poorv sandhya ke lie aaye the** (The guests came for the eve before the Hajj pilgrimage) - The passage directly states they arrived the evening before Hajj.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kaunsa kathan sahi hai?","The correct answer is **C: Mehman hajj yatra ke poorv sandhya ke lie aaye the**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""is imarat mein kayee teerthayaatri rehte the jo hajj yatra ke poorv sandhya par pavitra shahar mein aate the."" (This building housed many pilgrims who came to the holy city on the eve of the Hajj pilgrimage).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Koi mrityu nahi hui** - The passage states at least 15 people died (""Marane vaalon ke sankhya kamse kam 15 hai"").
* **B: Sabhi mehman Sanyukt Arab Amirat ke nagrik the** - The passage says ""Chhatrawas ke mehman adhikatar sanyukt arab amirat ke nagrik the"" (The guests of the hostel were *mostly* citizens of the United Arab Emirates).  ""Adhikatar"" means *most* not *all*.
* **D: Adhiktar mehman makka ke sthaniya log the** - The passage doesn't mention anything about the guests being local to Mecca; it states they were pilgrims.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, takraav ke baare me kaunsi jaankari pukhta nahi hai?","The correct answer is **A: Takraav ke size ki (The size of the crash)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Abhi bhi way yah pata lagaane ke koshish kar rahe hain ki crash kitna bada tha..."" This directly translates to ""They are still trying to find out how big the crash was."" This indicates the size of the crash is *not* confirmed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Takraav ke jagah ki (The location of the crash):** The passage states the satellites collided at an altitude of 491 miles, establishing a location (though not a precise ground location).
* **C: Takraav ke dharti par padne vale asar ki (The impact of the crash on Earth):** The passage states scientists are trying to determine how Earth will be affected, but this implies they *are* investigating its impact, not that it's unknown.
* **D: Malbe ki jagah ki (The location of the debris):** The US Department of Defense is monitoring the debris, meaning they *are* tracking its location.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, takraav ke baare me abhi kis baat ka pata lagaya jaana baaki hai?","The correct answer is **D: Crash kitna bada tha** (How big the crash was).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Abhi bhi way yah pata lagaane ke koshish kar rahe hain ki crash kitna bada tha aur dharti kis tarah se prabhaavit hogi."" (Scientists are still trying to figure out how big the crash was and how the Earth will be affected.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Malbe ki tracking ke kaam ko kaun sambhalega** (Who will handle the debris tracking) - The passage says the US Department of Defense is tracking the debris.
*   **B: Takraav ke samay satellite kitni raftar se udh rahi thin** (How fast the satellites were flying at the time of the crash) - The passage states the speed: ""karib 17,500 meal prati ghanta"" (approximately 17,500 meals per hour - likely a typo and meant to be kilometers per hour).
*   **C: Plotting analysis ka parinam kab share kiya jayega** (When will the plotting analysis results be shared) - The passage only says the results *will* be posted on a public website, not *when*.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, sabse ameer amerikiyon ke soochi mein Batten ko kis asthan par rakha gaya tha?","The correct answer is **C: 190 vein**.

The passage explicitly states: ""P: 2008 ke 400 sabse ameer amerikiyon ke soochi mein batten ko $ 2.3 billion ke anumaanit sampatti ke saath **190 vein asthan** par rakhaa gaya tha."" 

Therefore, the answer is 190th position."
Batten ne inmein se kisko daan diya?,"The correct answer is **B: Virginia university ko**.

The passage states that Batten ""graduated from the University of Virginia's College of Arts and Sciences"" and was a ""significant benefactor"" (meaning donor) of the university. While it's possible he donated to other institutions (option C), the passage *specifically* mentions his connection to and support of the University of Virginia.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sabse ameer amerikiyon ke soochi** - This is a list *of* Batten, not something he donated to.
*   **C: kaafi saare sansthanon ko** - The passage doesn't explicitly state he donated to ""many"" institutions, only that he was a benefactor.
*   **D: Khas taur par Kala aur vigyaan ke lie bane colleges ko** - While he graduated from the College of Arts and Sciences, the passage doesn't confirm he *specifically* donated to colleges *of* arts and sciences.



"
Governor Ernold schwarzenegger ne inme se kis bill par hastaskhar nahi kiye hain?,"The correct answer is **C: California ke bahar nabaligo ko beche ya kiraye par die jaane vaale hinsak video game ke ban par**.

Here's why:

The passage states the bill *prohibits selling or renting violent video games **to minors** in California*.  It doesn't mention anything about restrictions on sales *outside* of California. The bill focuses on what happens *within* the state.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: California mein nabaligo ko beche ya kiraye par die jaane vaale hinsak video game ke ban par** - The passage explicitly states the bill does this.
*   **B: Ullanghan karne vaalo par danda lagakar** - The passage mentions a $1000 fine for violations.
*   **D: Hinsak game par decal ki avashykta par** - The passage states violent games must have an ""18"" decal.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, kaun kahi gayi baato ko ansuna karta hai?","The correct answer is **C: Miller**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Miller said, """"mike sunate samay bahut saaree baatein karta hai ... mein taiyar ho rahaa tha isliye wah jo kaha rahaa tha mein vaastav mein use soon nahin rahaa tha"""". This directly translates to ""Mike talks a lot while broadcasting... I was getting ready, so I wasn't really listening to what he was saying.""

Therefore, Miller is the one admitting to not listening."
"Passgae ke hisab se, baate sunne ke mamle mein Miller ke lie inmein se kaunsi baat sach hai?","The correct answer is **B: Vah taiyaar hone ki vajah se baate sahi se sun nahi saka**

Here's why:

The passage directly states: """"mike sunate samay bahut saaree baatein karta hai ... mein taiyar ho rahaa tha isliye wah jo kaha rahaa tha mein vaastav mein use soon nahin rahaa tha"""" which translates to ""Mike says a lot of things while speaking... I was getting ready that's why I wasn't actually hearing what he was saying.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Duvall ne baaton ke dauraan Miller par prabhav daala** - The passage states Duvall did *not* affect Miller.
*   **C: Duvall ke bachche baaton ke beech me bahut baatein kar rahe the** - The passage makes no mention of Duvall’s children.
*   **D: Vah Duvall ki kahaani par pura dhayan de raha tha** - The passage explicitly states Miller wasn't listening attentively.



"
‘Swachh Vayu Adhiniyam’ (clean air aikt) mein sudhar karne ka sujhav kisne dia?,"The correct answer is **C: Jack Layton**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Laytonne pmse mulakat ke dauran conservative party ke paryaavaran bill mein badalaav ke liye kahaa tha.""  This translates to ""Layton, during the meeting with the PM, asked for changes to the Conservative party's environmental bill.""  Since the ""Swachh Vayu Adhiniyam"" (Clean Air Act) *is* the Conservative party's environmental bill in this context, Layton suggested improvements to it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: John Howard:** The text mentions Howard clarifying the funding for the hospital, but not suggesting changes to the Clean Air Act.
*   **B: The Conservative Party:** They *have* a bill, but Layton asked *them* for changes.
*   **D: Stephen Harper:** He agreed to send the bill to a committee *after* Layton requested changes. He didn't initiate the suggestion for improvement.



"
Is baat ka kisne khandan kia ki ‘Swachh Vayu Adhiniyam’ chunav se pehle kiya jaane vala stunt hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Pradhanmantri (Prime Minister)**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Lekin pradhaan mantri john hoardne kahaa hai ki yah adhiniyam kewal aspatal ke suvidhaon ko tasmanian sarkar dwara niche giranese bachaane ke liye atirikt aud $45 million dene ke liye tha.""  This directly translates to ""But Prime Minister John Howard said that this act was only to give an additional AUD $45 million to save hospital facilities from being lowered by the Tasmanian government.""

This is a direct denial of the claim that the act was a pre-election stunt.  The other options are not the ones making the denial.



"
Jab Cyanuric acid aur melamine compound billi ke mutra mein ek dusre ke sath pratikriya karte hain to kya banata hain?,"The correct answer is **C: Crystal**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""do compound ek dusre ke saath milkar crystal banaate hain jo kidney ke karyapranali ko rok kar sakte hain."" (the two compounds combine to form crystals that can block kidney function). 

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kidney:** The crystals *affect* the kidney, but aren't what's formed.
*   **B: Paltu jawaron ka bhojan (Pet food):** The contaminated pet food *contained* the compounds, but isn't what they form in the urine.
*   **D: Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR):** FTIR is a method used to *analyze* the crystals, not what they are.



"
Shodhkarta infrared spectroscopy ka istemaal kise observe karne ke lie karte hain?,"The correct answer is **B: Paltu janwar ke mutra mein crystal bante hue**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jab infra red spectroscopy (FTIR)se in crystals ke sanrachana ke tulna ke gayee, toh way prabhaavit paltu jaanvaron ke mutra mein paaye crystal se mail khaate hain."" This directly translates to ""When the structure of the crystals was compared using infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), it matched the crystals found in the urine of affected pets.""

This shows that FTIR was used to *observe and analyze the crystals* forming in the urine.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kidney ke karyapranali (Kidney function)** - The crystals *affect* kidney function, but FTIR wasn't used to observe the function itself.
*   **C: Jo paltu janwar prabhavit hue (Affected pets)** - FTIR was used on the crystals *from* the affected pets, not the pets themselves.
*   **D: Dooshit paltu bhojan (Contaminated pet food)** - FTIR was used to analyze the crystals, not the food.



"
Luna ko “Queen of Extreme” kisne kaha?,"The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The text states: ""Tommy Dreamer kahaa """"luna pahali queen off extreme thi."""" which translates to ""Tommy Dreamer said ""Luna was the first queen of extreme."""" 

Therefore, Tommy Dreamer is the one who called Luna ""Queen of Extreme""."
Luna ko “ajib” kisne kaha?,"The correct answer is **B: Dustin Runnels**.

The text explicitly states: ""Dustin """"goldst"""" runalsne tippani ke ki """"luna mere jaisi hi ajib thi...shayed mujhase bhi adhik..."""""". This translates to ""Dustin 'goldst' Runnels commented that 'Luna was as strange as I am...maybe even more so...'"".

Therefore, Dustin Runnels is the one who called Luna ""ajib"" (strange)."
Durghatna mein driver ke sath inmein se kya nahi hua?,"The correct answer is **C: Use Cambridge ke Great Yarmouth aspatal mein le jaya gaya**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Pehele use great yarmouth ke gems paigat aspatal mein bharti kiya gaya tha. Baad mein unhein cambridge mein edenbrook ke aspatal mein sthanantarit kar diya gaya.""  This means they were first taken to Great Yarmouth hospital, *then* transferred to Cambridge's Edenbrook hospital - not the other way around.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Usko sir me chot aayi:** The passage explicitly states the driver sustained serious head injuries (""driver ke sir mein gambhir chotein aayi thi"").
* **B: Usne ghar ke andar kisi ko nuksaan nahi pahuchaya:** The passage says ""Halanki teen log ghar ke under the phir bhi jab kar takrai tab kisi ko bhi chot nahin aayi,"" confirming no one inside the house was hurt.
* **D: Apataklin sevaaon ne gaadi se nikalne mein madad ki:** The passage states, ""apataklin sevaaonne driver ko laal rung ke audi ttse nikal diya tha,"" which means emergency services helped extract the driver from the car.



"
Rugby Taurnament ke dauraan Dakshin Africa ke gameplay mein kaunsi chiz sabse hatkar dikhai di?,"The correct answer is **A: Shaandar team work**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Unaki anushaasit raksha, gendbaji ke calla aur team ke achche kamne unhein baahar khadaa kar diya..."" This translates to ""Their disciplined defense, excellent passing, and **good teamwork** set them apart.""  The passage highlights teamwork as a key factor in South Africa's strong performance.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Ball ko sambhalne ki kshamta (Ability to handle the ball):** While good passing is mentioned, the passage doesn't emphasize ball-handling as the *most* outstanding aspect.
*   **C: Taurnament ki shuruat mein shaandar pradarshan (Excellent performance at the start of the tournament):** This is a result of their gameplay, not the gameplay itself. The passage focuses on *how* they performed, not just *that* they performed well initially.
*   **D: Rakshatamak kaushal (Defensive skills):**  Disciplined defense is mentioned, but it's presented *as part of* their overall strong teamwork, not as the single most outstanding element.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Dakshin Africa ke khel mein kab sudhar hua?","The correct answer is **D: Taurnament ke aage badhne par** (After advancing in the tournament).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""phir bhi lagaatar dakshin africane taurnament ke aage badhane par sudhaar kiya hai."" This translates to ""However, South Africa consistently improved after advancing in the tournament.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Subah 10:00 baje** (10:00 AM) - The game *started* at 10:00 AM, but the passage doesn't say they improved *at* that time.
* **B: Raska ko kadee karne baad** (After tightening defense) - While the passage mentions their disciplined defense, it doesn't link improvement *to* that specifically.
* **C: Zambia se harne ke baad** (After losing to Zambia) - They *won* against Zambia, they didn't lose.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inmein se kaunsa kathan Chean ki arthavyavastha ko satik roop se nahi dikhata?","The correct answer is **D: Chean ne germany ki tulna mein adhik karon ka niryaat kabhi nahi kiya.**

Here's why:

The passage *specifically states*: ""Pehli baar, pichle saal cheanne germany ke tulna mein adhik karon ka niryaat kiya..."" (For the first time, last year China exported more goods than Germany...).  Option D directly contradicts this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the passage:

* **A: Sudhar ke baad se Chean ki arthvyavastha mein tezi se badhotari hui** (Since the reforms, China's economy has improved rapidly) - The passage states ""Chean ka aarthik aakar 90 gunaa bada gaya hai"" (China's economic size has grown 90 times) which clearly indicates rapid improvement.
* **B: Car ke vyapar ke lie Chean me America se bhi badha bazaar hai** (China has a larger market for car trade than America) - The passage states ""is vyavasaay kshetra ke sabse badey bazar ke sanyukt rajya americase age nickel gaya"" (it surpassed the United States as the largest market in this business sector).
* **C: Chean ke gdp america ke gdp se zyada ho sakti hai** (China's GDP could exceed America's GDP) - The passage explicitly says ""Chean ke gdp aane waale do dashakon may america ke gdpse zyada ho sakti hai."" (China's GDP could exceed America's GDP in the next two decades).



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Chean ki gdp America ki gdp se kitne samay me aage nikal sakti hai?","The correct answer is **B: Do dashakon mein**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Chean ke gdp aane waale **do dashakon may** america ke gdpse zyada ho sakti hai."" (China's GDP could surpass America's GDP in the next **two decades**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Adhik aarthik sudharo ke baad (After further economic reforms)** - While reforms are mentioned as a key factor in China's growth, the passage doesn't tie the GDP surpassing to *further* reforms, just that it *could* happen in the next two decades.
* **C: Naye netratav ke andar (Under new leadership)** - Leadership is mentioned in the context of past reforms, but not as a condition for surpassing the US GDP.
* **D: teen dashakon ke andar (Within three decades)** - The passage specifically states *two* decades, not three.



"
Hu ne vikashil deshon ko kya karne ka sujhav dia?,"The correct answer is **D: Pradooshan ke purane rastho se bachne ka** (To avoid old ways of polluting).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hoone vikashil deshon ko """"puraane tareekonse pradooshan failaanese rokane aur baad mein safai karne ke liye protsaahit kiya."""" (Hoone encouraged developing countries to ""prevent pollution from old methods and clean up later."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jimmedari lene ka jisse unka vikas tezi se ho** (Taking responsibility to ensure their rapid development) - While Hoone mentioned not burdening developing nations with unrealistic responsibilities, he didn't *suggest* taking on more for faster development.
* **B: Aarthik utpaadan par dhyan dena** (Focusing on economic production) - The passage does mention economic production as a basis for targets, but it isn't what Hoone *suggested* to developing nations.
* **C: Apni maujood jimmedariyon ke alava aur jimmedari nibhane ka** (Taking on more responsibility in addition to existing ones) - This is the opposite of what Hoone said; he cautioned against asking developing nations to take on *more* responsibility than they can handle.



"
Hu ne kis baat ka ullekh nahi kiya?,"The correct answer is **D: Carbon utsarjan ki katautee ka aankada (The figure for carbon emission reduction)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""unhone katauti ke liye koi aankada nirdhaarit nahin kiya."" (They did not determine any figure for the reduction.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: katauti ka adhar (The basis of the reduction):** The passage states reductions will be based on ""way chean ke aarthik utpaadan"" (way chean's economic production).
* **B: Pradooshan ke mamle mein vikasashil deshon ko sujhav (Suggestions to developing countries regarding pollution):** The passage mentions Hoon encouraging developing nations to prevent pollution and clean up later.
* **C: Vah taareekh jisme ummeed hai ki carbon ke utsarjan mein katautee hogi (The date by which carbon emission reduction is expected):** The passage specifies a timeframe of ""2005 ke starse 2020 tak"" (from 2005 to 2020).



"
Veeraman ne inmein se kiske lie kaha ki haalat achche nahin hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

Here's why:

The text states Richard Veeraman (pravakta of Medicines Sense Frontier) said: """"angola mein mahamari failane ke rtaar ab tak ke sabse bure daur mein pahunch gayi hai aur vahan ke haalat bahut kharab hain."""" -  ""the way the epidemic is spreading in **Angola** has reached the worst phase so far and the situation there is very bad.""

He is specifically talking about the situation *in Angola*.  While Medicines Sense Frontier is his organization, he's describing the condition of Angola.
"
Abhiyojan ki vajah se Hoon ka cabinet pad kaun lega?,"The correct answer is **A: Davey**.

Here's why:

The text states: "" Hoonne istifa dei diya hai. mantrimandal mein unaki jagah saansad aid devi lenge.""  (Hoon has resigned. MP Aid Davey will take his place in the cabinet.)

Therefore, Aid Davey will be taking Hoon's cabinet position."
Abhiyojan ke maddenajar vyapar mantree ki bhoomika kaun nibhaega?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""saansad norman lamb ke vyapar mantri banane ke ummid hai."" (MP Norman Lamb is expected to become the Business Secretary). 

Therefore, Lamb will be taking on the role of Business Secretary (Vyapar Mantri)."
Kemili cent-sense opera ke dauraan kalakar darshakon ko kya karane ke lie protsaahit karate hain?,"The correct answer is **C: Munch par performance me shamil hone ke lie** (To participate in the performance on Munch).

Here's why:

The passage (P) specifically states: ""...yetheatre khud darshakon ko bhi isamen saath shamil hone ke liye prerit karte hain."" which translates to ""...the theatre itself encourages the audience to participate in it.""  This refers to participating in the performance happening *on Munch*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ganje bhari sigaraten peene ke lie** (To smoke marijuana-filled cigarettes) - While the passage mentions artists smoking these, it doesn't say they encourage the *audience* to do so.
* **B: Japan ki yatra karne ke lie** (To travel to Japan) - Japan is mentioned as being *shown* in the opera, not as something the audience is invited to do.
* **D: Unhe apni zindagi ki pasandida chize karne ke lie** (To do their favorite things in life) - This is too broad and not mentioned in the passage.



"
Opera ke dauraan mukhya roop se sigarate kaun peeta hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Kalakaar** (The Artist).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""munch par kalakar ganje bhari sigaraten peete hain"" - ""On stage, the artist smokes cigarettes filled with marijuana.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: France ke darshak (French audience):** The passage says the theatre *encourages* the audience to join in, but doesn't state they are smoking.
* **C: Perfrom karne vala (Performer):** While the artist *is* a performer, the passage specifically names ""kalakar"" (artist) as the smoker.
* **D: Kemili cent-sense:** This is the name of the opera itself, not a character who smokes.



"
"""Leonov ka """"spacewalk"""" vala doosara naam kya hai?""","The correct answer is **C: Extravehicular activity**.

Here's why:

The passage states Leonov performed the first *maanavyukt chahalkadami (EVA)*, which is then clarified as """"spacewalk"""".  EVA stands for Extravehicular Activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Apollo-Soyuz mission:** This was a later mission Leonov *led*, not a name for the spacewalk itself.
*   **B: Antariksh Race:** This is the broader context of the time, but not a name for the spacewalk.
*   **D: Cosmonaut No. 11:** This is a nickname for Leonov, but not a name for the spacewalk.



"
Lenove ne kis mission ke soviate bhaag ka netritva kiya?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Dasa saal baad, unhone apolo-soyuz mission ke soviate bhaag ka netritva kiya..."" (Ten years later, he led the Soviet part of the Apollo-Soyuz mission...)



"
Durghatna me kaun ghayal hua?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibson**.

The text explicitly states: ""Durghatna ke baad, gibson ko aspatal pahunchaaya gaya lekin kuch hi samay baad unaki mrityu ho gayee."" (After the accident, Gibson was taken to the hospital but died shortly after.)  This means Gibson was injured in the accident.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Garrage mein kam karne vala:** The text says he *saw* the accident, it doesn't say he was injured.
* **C: Bachche:** The text states the children *ran away* from the scene, meaning they were not injured.
* **D: Truck driver:** The text states the truck driver was *not* injured. (""Truck chaalak, jiski umr 64 saal hai, durghatna mein ghayal nahin hua tha."")



"
Jin logon ke sath durghatana hui unka kya hua?,"The correct answer is **B: Ek ko kuch nahi hua, doosra mar gaya**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Durghatna ke baad, gibson ko aspatal pahunchaaya gaya lekin kuch hi samay baad unaki mrityu ho gayee."" (After the accident, Gibson was taken to the hospital but died shortly after.)  This means Gibson died.
* **The passage also states:** ""Truck chaalak, jiski umr 64 saal hai, durghatna mein ghayal nahin hua tha."" (The 64-year-old truck driver was not injured in the accident.) This means the truck driver was unharmed.

Therefore, one person (Gibson) died, and one person (the truck driver) was unharmed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dono mar gaye** (Both died) - Incorrect, the truck driver was unharmed.
* **C: Vey ro aur chilla rahe the** (They were crying and shouting) - Incorrect, this refers to children *near* the accident, not the people *involved* in the accident.
* **D: Dono ghayal ho gaye** (Both were injured) - Incorrect, Gibson died and the truck driver wasn't injured.



"
Karyakram par kaam kar rahe vaigyaanik inmein se kiski vajah se hone vaale prabhaavon ko observe karne ki ummeed kar rahe the?,"The correct answer is **D: Dark matter**.

Here's why:

The passage states the team was searching for the effect ""between the dark matter of the Milky Way and the dark matter of the Sagittarius galaxy"". They were simulating observations to understand how dark matter interacts, and the analogy to tides (caused by the moon's gravity) illustrates how one galaxy's dark matter would affect another.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aam padaarth (Ordinary matter):** The passage specifically focuses on *dark* matter and its interactions, not ordinary matter.
*   **B: Jwaar bhaata (Tides):** Tides are used as an *analogy* to explain the effect, but are not what the scientists were directly observing or studying.
*   **C: Chhote kan (Small clumps):** While the passage mentions dark matter forming ""many small clumps"", the scientists were looking for the overarching *effect* of dark matter interactions, not the clumps themselves.



"
Vaigyaanik inmein se kaunse matter ko observe kar rahe the?,"The correct answer is **D: Sagitarius galaxy aur akashganga** (Sagittarius galaxy and Milky Way).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the team was simulating observations *of the Sagittarius galaxy* to understand the influence between it and *the Milky Way* (akashganga).  They were looking at how the Milky Way's dark matter affected the Sagittarius galaxy, and vice versa.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Akashganga aur chand** (Milky Way and Moon) - The moon is used as an *analogy* to explain tidal forces, but it's not what the scientists were directly observing.
*   **B: Prithvi aur Sagitarius galaxy** (Earth and Sagittarius galaxy) - Earth isn't mentioned as an object of observation.
*   **C: Prithvi aur chand** (Earth and Moon) - Similar to A, the Earth and Moon are used for an analogy, not the actual observation."
"Passage ke hisab se, roodhivaadiyon ne kiski aalochana nahin ki?","Sahi jawab hai **A: Rahat raashi ke kharch ki**.

Passage mein yeh kaha gaya hai ki roodhivaadiyon ne ""bushes ke nyu orleans deal"" ka mazaak banaya aur unhone punarnirmaan ke theke kisko diye gaye is par aalochana ki.  Rahat raashi ke kharch ki aalochana ka zikr passage mein nahi hai.

इसलिए, सही उत्तर A है।"
Toofaan catarina ke rahat prayaason ke lie punarnirmaan contract ki aalochana kaun kar raha hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Rajkoshiya roodhivaadi (Fiscal conservatives)**.

Here's why:

The text states: "" *kuch rajkoshiya roodhivaadiyonne """"bushes ke nyu orleans deal"""" ka mazaak banaaya hai.*"" (some fiscal conservatives mocked ""Bush's New Orleans deal""). This directly indicates that fiscal conservatives are criticizing the reconstruction contracts related to the relief efforts for Hurricane Katrina.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Udaaravaadee (Liberals):** The text does not mention liberals criticizing the contracts.
*   **C: Bush:** While the deal is *named* after Bush, the text says conservatives are mocking the deal, not Bush himself being the critic.
*   **D: Washington ke logon ne (People of Washington):** The text says the criticism focuses on contracts being given to people *within* Washington (meaning those connected to the government), not the entire population of Washington.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, stardust antariksh yaan ke light sabse pehle kahaan dikhai degi?","The correct answer is **B: Northern California**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Subah lagbhag 5 baje... capsule dharti ko chhookar vayumandal mein pravesh karta hai, tab **uttari california**, auregan, nevada aur utaah ke logon ke liye ek shandar light show pesh karne ke apeksha hoti hai."" 

This translates to: ""Around 5 am... when the capsule touches Earth and enters the atmosphere, it is expected to present a spectacular light show for the people of **Northern California**, Oregon, Nevada, and Utah.""

Therefore, the light show will be visible *first* in Northern California. While it will be visible in the other locations as well, Northern California is mentioned first, indicating it will be the initial point of viewing.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, antariksh yaan inmein se kaunsa record banayega?","The correct answer is **C: Sabse tezi se dharti par vapas lautne ka** (Returning to Earth at the fastest speed).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Stardust dharti ke or itni tezise vaapas lautega ki ab tak ke saare record toot jayenge. filhal yah record apolo x ke command module ke naam hai jo maee, 1969 mein sabse tez gatise dharti mein vaapas lota tha.""  This directly translates to ""Stardust will return to Earth so fast that all previous records will be broken. Currently, this record belongs to the Apollo X command module, which returned to Earth at the fastest speed in May 1969.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Asman mein light show pesh karne ka** (Presenting a light show in the sky) - The passage says it *will* present a light show, but doesn't frame it as breaking a record.
* **B: Jyadatar shehro me dikhne ka** (Being visible in most cities) -  The passage only mentions visibility in specific states.
* **D: San Francisco se Los Angeles tak ki sabase tez yaatra karega** (Will travel fastest from San Francisco to Los Angeles) - While it mentions the speed of travel *between* those cities, the record-breaking aspect is the *return to Earth* speed.



"
Dr. Malar Balasubramanian ka Saroja Balasubramanian se kya sambandh tha?,"The correct answer is **C: Mata** (Mother).

The text states ""una par budhwar ko apni kar ke dikki mein apni maan ke mrit paaye jaane ke baad"" which translates to ""after her mother was found dead in the trunk of her car."" Therefore, Saroja Balasubramanian was Dr. Malar Balasubramanian's mother.

Sara Balasubramanian ka shav kahaan mila?,"The correct answer is **C: Car ki dikki mein**.

The passage states: ""Ohiyo mein adhikariyon ka kahna hai ki ek doctor... apni kar ke dikki mein apni maan ke mrit paaye jaane ke baad sangeen hatyaa ke aarop lagenge."" This translates to ""Ohio authorities say a doctor... will be charged with murder after finding her mother's body in the trunk of her car.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cincinnati mein** - While the doctor was *found* near Cincinnati, the body was not found there.
*   **B: Sadak ke bagal mein** - The doctor was found by the side of the road, not the body.
*   **D: Pittsburgh mein** - The doctor worked in Pittsburgh, but the body was found in Ohio."
eBay ne kiska adhigrahan kiya?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""P: yah ebay ke itihas mein sabse bada adhigrahan hai."" (This is eBay's largest acquisition in history.) and then mentions Skype.  Therefore, eBay acquired Skype.

The passage does *not* mention Microsoft, Apple, or Zoom."
Is adhigrahan se eBay kya haasil karana chaahata hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Naye chhetro me vistar karna** (Expand into new regions).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that eBay hopes to diversify its revenue streams and gain popularity in regions where Skype is strong, such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil. This directly indicates a desire to **expand into new regions**.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Apne revenue ko consolidate karna** (Consolidate its revenue) - While integration *might* lead to consolidation eventually, the passage focuses on *new* revenue sources, not just organizing existing ones.
*   **C: Apni profile ko behtar banana** (Improve its profile) - This is a general benefit of a successful acquisition, but not the primary *goal* stated in the passage.
*   **D: Apne sheyaradharkon ko santushth karna** (Satisfy its shareholders) - Satisfying shareholders is a general business aim, but the passage highlights a specific *strategy* (regional expansion) to achieve growth and ultimately shareholder value.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, kisne ladai ke baad yard mein rah gaye kaidiyon se baatchit nahin ki?","The correct answer is **B: Agni bachav dal ne** (The fire rescue team).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""Baatchit karne vaalonne isthiti ko sudhaarne ke koshish ke"" (People tried to talk to improve the situation). This implies some communication was attempted.
*   It specifically mentions ""less adhikariyonne ahaate mein pravesh kiya"" (officials entered the area) to control the situation with tear gas.
*   The passage doesn't mention the fire rescue team (Agni bachav dal) engaging in any communication; their role was solely to extinguish the fire.
*   Hospital staff (Aspatal ke staff) are only mentioned in relation to the injured.
*   Vartakaron (negotiators) could have been among those attempting communication, but it's not specific enough to be the definitive answer.

Therefore, the fire rescue team is the only group explicitly *not* mentioned as having attempted to communicate with the remaining prisoners."
Inmein se kiski vajah se antatah kaidi dange se peechhe hat gaye?,"The correct answer is **B: Aansu gas**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jald hi, dangaa sambandhi upkaranon se less adhikariyonne ahaate mein pravesh kiya aur kaidiyon ko aansu gases ke madadse kabu mein kar lia."" (Soon, officers entered the premises with riot gear and controlled the prisoners with the help of tear gas).  Following this, the fire was extinguished, indicating the tear gas was the direct cause of the prisoners being subdued.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Safal baatchit (Successful negotiation):** The passage explicitly says negotiations were attempted but the prisoners' demands were unclear, meaning they were *not* successful.
* **C: Ghayal sathiyon ki vajah se (Because of injured comrades):** While the injured were taken to the hospital, the passage doesn't link this to the end of the riot.
* **D: Aag ki vajah se (Because of the fire):** The fire was *extinguished* after the prisoners were subdued, meaning it wasn't the cause of them backing down.



"
"Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ki raay mein, Iraan desh ko khud ko kis chiz se mukt karana chahiye?","The correct answer is **D: Tail pe nirbharta (Dependence on oil)**.

The passage states: ""Desh ke supreme leader ayatollah ally khaamenine tell par nirbharta ko ek aise """"jaal"""" ke roop mein paribhaashit kiya hai jo 1979 mein iraan ke islamic kranti ke pahle se bunaa jaa raha hai aur jisase desh ko apne aapko azad karna chaahiye."" This directly translates to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei defining dependence on oil as a ""trap"" from which the country should free itself.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vittiya pratibandhon (Financial sanctions):** While the passage discusses financial sanctions, Khamenei doesn't say Iran needs to free itself *from* them, but rather that oil dependence is the underlying issue.
*   **B: Islamic kraanti (Islamic Revolution):** The passage mentions the Islamic Revolution as a point of reference but doesn't state it's something to be freed from.
*   **C: Videshi aay (Foreign income):** The passage talks about foreign income being affected, but Khamenei's focus is on the *source* of that income – oil – not the income itself.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Irani arthavyavastha par pratibandh ke prabhaav ko kisne swikar kiya?","The correct answer is **A: Varishth sootron ne** (Senior officials).

The passage explicitly states: ""Television par kiye gaye live comments mein **pahali baar senior iranian sootronne** yah maanaa tha ki pratibandhon ko koi prabhaav hua tha."" (For the first time, **senior Iranian officials** admitted that the sanctions had an effect.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: OPEC ne:** While OPEC reported a decline in oil exports, they didn't *acknowledge the effect of sanctions*. They just reported a fact.
* **C: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ne:** He criticized dependence on oil, but didn't *admit sanctions had an impact*.
* **D: European sangh ne:** They *imposed* the sanctions, but the passage doesn't say they acknowledged their effect on the Iranian economy.



"
Inmein se kya frace ki matdan prakriya ka hissa nahin hai?,"Sahi jawab hai **D: Ummidvaar ke pratinidhiyon dwara voton ki ginati kiya jana**.

Passage mein bataya gaya hai ki voting ke baad, sham ko swayamsevakon dwara kadee nigrani mein voton ki ginati ki jaati hai, ummidvaron ke pratinidhiyon dwara nahin.

Baki options passage mein bataye gaye hain:

*   **Pardarshi matdan boxes:** 1988 ke baad se matpetiyan pardarshi hone chaahiye thi.
*   **ummidavaron ki aur se bheje gaye pratinidhi:** Ummidwar prakriya ke har hisse ko dekhne ke liye pratinidhi bhej sakte hain.
*   **Voting roll par hastaakshar karana:** Matdaata voting role par hastakshar kar deta hai."
Matdata apne chune hue ummidvaar ka sanket kahaan dete hain?,"The correct answer is **C: Lifafe par**.

The passage explicitly states: ""matadaata kagaj ke ek poorv-mudrit shit daalte hain jo lifafe mein unki pasand ke ummidwar ko darshaati hai"" - which translates to ""voters cast a pre-printed paper ballot in an envelope indicating their preferred candidate.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Voting roll par** - The voting roll is where they *sign* to confirm their identity, not where they indicate their candidate choice.
*   **B: kagaj ki ek poorv-mudrit shit par** - The pre-printed sheet itself is blank, the choice is marked *on* it and then placed *in* the envelope.
*   **D: Matdan kendra par lagi machine par** - The passage describes a traditional paper ballot system, not a machine-based one.



"
Allen ko Musashi ki aath saal ki khoj shuroo karne ke lie kis chiz se prerna mili?,"The correct answer is **D: Unke yudh me hone vali dilchaspi se** (His interest in the war).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Allen ne mushishi ko yuddh mein aajivan ruchise baahar khojne ke liye apni khoj shuru ke."" This translates to ""Allen started his search to find Musashi, having a lifelong interest in the war.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uski sampatti se** (From his wealth) - While he *used* his wealth, it wasn't the initial motivation.
*   **B: Unki samudree tal manchitran ki ruchi se** (From his interest in seafloor mapping) - Seafloor mapping was a *method* used in the search, not the reason for starting it.
*   **C: Unke samudree anveshan mein nivesh se** (From his investment in marine exploration) - Similar to A, investment was a consequence of his motivation, not the cause.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Allen ne apne dhan ka ek ahem hissa kis par kharch kiya?","The correct answer is **B: Samudri anveshan mein** (In marine exploration).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Duniya ke sabse dhanee logon mein se ek alonne apni sampatti ka adhikansh hissa samudri khoj mein lagaaya..."" (One of the wealthiest people in the world, Allen, spent most of his fortune on marine exploration...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Musashi ko punarsthaapit karane mein** (In restoring the Musashi) - While finding the Musashi was the *goal* of the exploration, the spending was on the exploration itself, not restoring the wreck (yet).
*   **C: ROV banane mein** (In making ROVs) - ROVs were *used* in the exploration, but the passage doesn't say Allen spent a significant amount on *building* them.
*   **D: Samudri satah ki mapping sikhne mein** (In learning sea surface mapping) - Mapping was a *method* used during the exploration, not the primary area of spending.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inmein se kiske karan plant mein aur uske aas-pas khataranaak sthitiyaan utpann hone ki sambhavana hai?","The correct answer is **A: Uranium Idhan (Uranium Fuel)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Adhikariyon ke anuman ke anusaar site par uranium eendhan rakhane vaale container toot gaye honge aur leak ho rahe honge."" (Officials estimate that containers holding uranium fuel on the site have broken and are leaking.) This directly links the uranium fuel to the hazardous situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Radioactive caesium:** While the passage mentions radioactive caesium being detected, it's a *result* of the leak, not the *cause*. The source of the caesium is the leaking fuel.
* **C: Safed dhuan (White smoke):** The white smoke is a *symptom* of the problem, an observation, but not the underlying cause of the danger.
* **D: Iodine:** Similar to caesium, iodine is a radioactive substance detected, but it's a consequence of the leak, not the primary hazard.



"
Plant mein hui ghatna ke baad sthaniy nivasiyon ko bataye gaye suraksha sujhavon mein se kaunsa inmein se ek nahin hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Safed dhuyen ko andar lene ke lie** (To inhale the white smoke).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states residents are being warned to **stay indoors** (Ghar ke andar rahein) to *avoid* the white smoke, not inhale it. The other options are all directly mentioned as safety suggestions:

* **A: Air-Conditioner ka istemal band karne ke lie** (To stop using the air conditioner) - mentioned in the passage.
* **B: Ghar ke andar rehne ke lie** (To stay indoors) - mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Nal ka paani peene se parhej karne ke lie** (To avoid drinking tap water) - mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, inhaling the smoke is the opposite of the advice given."
"Dr. Moll ke hisab se, XDR-TB ke baare mein sabse chintaajanak baat kya hai?","The correct answer is **D: Iski mrityu dar bahut adhik hai**.

The passage explicitly states that Dr. Dou said the high mortality rate was ""very worrying and dangerous"". While the other options are mentioned in the passage as facts about XDR-TB, the *most* concerning aspect, according to Dr. Dou, is the high death rate.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage mentions hospital-acquired infections but doesn't frame this as the *most* concerning aspect.
*   **B:** Drug resistance is a characteristic of XDR-TB, but Dr. Dou focuses on the consequence of that resistance – the high death rate.
*   **C:** The transmissibility is mentioned, but again, not highlighted as the primary concern."
Naye variant se sankramit kitane marizon ke svasthyakarmi hone ki pushti ki gayi?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The text states: ""...aur in mein kamse kam do aspatal swaasthya karyakarta the."" which translates to ""...and among them were at least two hospital health workers.""

Therefore, the answer is 2."
Nextjen pranali kis takneek ka upyog karti hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Upgrah-aadhaarit takneek (Satellite-based technology)**.

The passage explicitly states that Nextjen pranali uses ""upgrah-aadhaarit praudyogiki"" (satellite-based technology).  The passage also contrasts it *against* ""puraane zameeni-radar-aadhaarit takneek"" (old ground-radar-based technology), further solidifying this answer."
Nextjen hawai yatayat niyantrakon ko sidhe kaise laabh pahunchaata hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Adhik steak vimaan ki jagah**.

Here's why:

The passage states that NextGen uses satellite technology to help air traffic controllers ""अधिक सateekta ke saath vimaan ko chalaane"" (guide aircraft with more accuracy) and provide pilots with ""अधिक steak jaankari"" (more accurate information). This directly translates to controllers having a more precise understanding of aircraft positions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chhote udaan maarg (Shorter flight paths):** While NextGen *enables* shorter flight paths, this isn't how it directly benefits controllers. It's a *result* of the improved accuracy.
*   **C: Carbon utsarjan mein kami (Reduction in carbon emissions):**  This is a benefit of NextGen, but not how it *directly* helps controllers.
*   **D: Kam Indhan (Less fuel):** This is also a benefit, but again, a result of the system, not a direct benefit to controllers.

"Passage ke hisaab se, kis chiz par dhyan kendrit karne ke lie itihasakaron ne FBI ki aalochana nahin ki?","Sahi jawab **A: Unki safalta dar ki vridhi par** hai.

Passage mein yeh bataya gaya hai ki itihaskaron ne FBI ki neetiyon ki aalochana ki hai jo agency ki safalta dar ko *badhaane* ke iraade se sansadhanon ko kendrit karne ka prayas karti hain. Iska matlab hai ki unhone safalta dar ko badhane ke prayas ki aalochana ki, safalta dar ke *badhane* par nahi.

Baaki vikalp passage mein ullekhit hain:

*   **B:** Passage mein bataya gaya hai ki itihaskaron ne aasaani se sulajhane vaale aparaadhon ke liye sansaadhan aavantit karne par aalochana ki hai.
*   **C:** Passage mein bataya gaya hai ki Congress ne vayask pornography ke liye nidhikaran kiya aur FBI ko is par dhyan kendrit karne ko kaha.
*   **D:** Passage mein bataya gaya hai ki itihaskaron ne kar chori ke mamlon par dhyan kendrit karne par aalochana ki hai.

Isliye, **A** hi vah chiz hai jis par itihaskaron ne FBI ki aalochana nahin ki."
Ashlilta ki pehal FBI ko kya karne ke lie majaboor karti hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Agents ko pornograhy vale mamlo me samarpit karna chahiye** (Agents should be dedicated to pornography cases).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Congressne vitt varsh 2005 mein ashlilata ke liye nidhikaran shuru kiya aur nirdisht kiya ki fbi ko vayask pornography ke liye 10 agents ko samarpit karna chaahiye."" (Congress started funding for obscenity in fiscal year 2005 and specified that the FBI should dedicate 10 agents to adult pornography.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage mentions resource allocation broadly, but doesn't say the obscenity initiative *forces* them to allocate more to car theft.
* **B:**  The passage states a concern that focusing on easy cases *could* increase the agency's success rate, but the obscenity initiative itself doesn't force this.
* **C:** While the passage mentions focusing on easily solvable crimes as a potential outcome of FBI policy, the obscenity initiative doesn't directly require this.



"
JAS 39c Gripen ki durghatana par pratikriya dene vaale agnishaman vahan ka kya hua? ,"The correct answer is **B: Ludhak gaya**.

The text states: ""...jiski vajah se vaanijyik udaanon ke liye hawai adde ko band kar diya gaya. ...Sthaaniya mediane bataaya hai ki karravaai karne ke dauran airport ka agnishaamak vaahan **ludhak gaya** tha."" 

This directly translates to ""...which led to the airport being closed for commercial flights. ...Local media reported that the airport's fire truck **skidded/slid** while responding."""
"JAS 39C Gripen ke durghatanagrast hone ke baad, hawai adde ko kiske lie band kar diya gaya tha?","The correct answer is **A: Vaanijyik udaanon**.

The text states: ""...जिसकी वजह से **वाणिज्यिक उड़ानों के लिए हवाई अड्डे को बंद कर दिया गया**"" (which caused the airport to be closed for **commercial flights**).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Agnishaamak vaahan (Firefighting vehicle)** - While a firefighting vehicle crashed during response, the airport wasn't closed *for* the vehicle, but because of the plane crash.
* **C: Sthaniya media (Local media)** - The media *reported* on the closure, they didn't cause it.
* **D: Squadron Leaders** -  Squadron Leader Dilokrit Patavi was the pilot; the airport wasn't closed because of them.



"
Irani kranti ke dauraan brejhinski ne kiske salahkar bane the?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

The passage states that Brezhinski served as National Security Advisor to Henry Kissinger *from* 1977-1981 and *assisted Carter* in handling world affairs like the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Therefore, during the Iranian Revolution, he was advising Carter.



"
Saal 1977 tak rashtriya suraksha salahakar ke pad par kaun raha?,"The correct answer is **B: Kissinger**.

The passage states that Brzezinski served as National Security Advisor *from 1977 to 1981*, implying Kissinger held the position before that."
Inmein se kaunsi uplabdi partizen belgrade ke sath bobek ke career ko satik roop se nahin darshati hai?,"Sahi jawab hai **A: Unhonne team ke lie khelte hue 468 se adhik goal kiye**.

Pyaas mein kaha gaya hai ki Bobeck ne apni team ke saath 468 mukabalon mein 403 goal score kiye the. Yeh ullekh nahi kiya gaya hai ki unhone 468 se adhik goal score kiye the.

Baaki uplabdhian darshai gayi hain:

*   **B:** Pyaas mein kaha gaya hai ki Bobeck ne ""Bobeck ke tulna mein kisi aur ne kabhi bhi club ke liye zyada pradarshan yaa zyada goal nahin kiye hain.""
*   **C:** Pyaas mein kaha gaya hai ki ""1995 mein, unhein partizen ke itihas ka sabse shandar khiladi chuna gaya.""
*   **D:** Pyaas mein kaha gaya hai ki unhone 468 mukabalon mein khelte hue goal score kiye, jis se yeh sandarbh hai ki unhone kaafi game khele."
Partizan belgrade ke sath bobek ke itihaas ke baare mein inmein se kaunsa kathan satya hai?,"सही उत्तर है **A: उन्होंने 1945 से पार्टिज़न के लिए खेलना शुरू किया**।

यहाँ क्यों:

*   **पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है:** ""वह 1945 में उनके साथ जुड़े और 1958 तक उनके साथ काम किया।"" इसका मतलब है कि उन्होंने 1945 में पार्टिज़न के लिए खेलना शुरू किया।

अन्य विकल्प गलत क्यों हैं:

*   **B: पार्टिज़न बेलग्रेड से पहले वह ज़ाग्रेब के लिए खेले** - पाठ में कहा गया है कि वह क्रोएशिया की राजधानी ज़ाग्रेब में पैदा हुए थे, लेकिन यह नहीं कहा गया है कि उन्होंने वहां कोई टीम खेली थी।
*   **C: वह 1995 तक पार्टिज़न के लिए खेले** - पाठ में कहा गया है कि उन्होंने 1958 तक पार्टिज़न के लिए खेला, न कि 1995 तक। 1995 में उन्हें पार्टिज़न के इतिहास का सबसे शानदार खिलाड़ी चुना गया था।
*   **D: पार्टिज़न के सबसे अच्छे खिलाड़ी के तौर पर जाने जाने के बाद उसने काफी नाम कमाया** - पाठ में उल्लेख किया गया है कि उन्हें 1995 में चुना गया था, लेकिन यह नहीं कहा गया है कि इससे पहले उन्होंने नाम नहीं कमाया था। वास्तव में, पाठ बताता है कि उन्होंने खेलते समय नाम कमाया।"
Passage ke anusaar kaun si vishesta Hesperonychus ko Velociraptor se alag banati hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Iska dusra panja bada hai** (Its second claw is large).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Iska doosra panja bada tha, jisase iska naam hesperonicus paan, jiska earth hai """"paschimi panja""""."" (Its second claw was large, which is where the name Hesperonychus comes from, meaning ""western claw."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Iske do pair hain** (It has two legs) - The passage states Hesperonychus walked on two legs *like* Velociraptor, but this doesn't *distinguish* it.
* **C: Iske pure shareer mein pankh hain** (It has feathers all over its body) - The passage mentions it was *fully feathered* but doesn't state this is a differentiating factor from Velociraptor.
* **D: Iska khoon garam hai** (Its blood is warm) -  The passage says it was likely warm-blooded, but again, doesn't state Velociraptor wasn't also warm-blooded.



"
“Hesperonychus” ka matlab kis prajati ki sharirik visheshta se nikala gya hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Panje**.

The passage states: ""Iska doosra panja bada tha, jisase iska naam hesperonicus paan, jiska earth hai """"paschimi panja""""."" This directly translates to ""Its second claw was large, from which its name Hesperonychus, meaning 'western claw,' originated.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""Hesperonychus"" is derived from the characteristic of its claw."
Inme se kaun sa kathan shooting ke bare mein shi hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Shooting Buffalo mein hui**.

Here's why:

*   The text states, ""Shooting mein marane waale chaar logon..."" (Four people died in the shooting...) and earlier mentions the couple came to Buffalo to celebrate their wedding. This clearly indicates the shooting occurred in Buffalo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pati aur biwi dono Texas se the** - The husband was born in Buffalo, but the text doesn't say where the wife is from.
*   **B: Panch peedit the** - The text states four people died, it doesn’t mention how many people were injured.
*   **C: Couple ki shaadi ek saal pehle Buffalo mein hui** - The text says they had their wedding a year ago *in* Taxus, then came to Buffalo to celebrate."
Inme se kaun sa kathan shooting ka event kahan hua us jagah ke bare mein shi hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Texas ki party mein**.

Here's why:

* The text states the couple had their wedding and celebrated with friends and family *in Buffalo* a year ago.
* However, the shooting happened *at a party in Texas*.  The text specifically mentions ""shooting mein marne waale chaar logon"" occurred in Texas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Buffalo mein varshgaanth ki party mein hui thi:** The shooting didn't happen at the anniversary party itself (which was postponed), but in Texas.
* **B: Aupchaarik varshgaanth karyakram mein:** The formal anniversary program hadn't happened yet.
* **D: Dampati ki shaadi mein:** The shooting occurred a year *after* the wedding.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, shuruat me Luno ko lekar adhikaariyon ko chinta kya thi?","The correct answer is **D: Chaalak dull ke sadasyon ko chot lagne ki sambhavna**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""shuruat mein adhikariyon ko darr tha ki maal ka bhar shayed adhik ho"" (initially, officials feared that the cargo load might be excessive). This implies their concern was about the *ship's stability and the potential for harm to the crew* due to an overloaded cargo. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Urvarak Cargo ki kami (Lack of fertilizer cargo)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about a shortage of fertilizer.
*   **B: Lehrein aur tez hawayein (Waves and strong winds)** - While waves and winds *caused* the ship to break apart, they weren't the initial concern of the officials.
*   **C: eendhan ka risaav (Fuel leak)** - There's no mention of a fuel leak in the passage.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Luno ke tootane ke baare mein inmein se kaun sa kathan satya nahin hai?","The correct answer is **B: Tootane ke samay jahaaz mein 100 meter eendhan bhara hua tha** (At the time of the breakdown, the ship had 100 meters of fuel).

Here's why:

* **The passage states Luno had 120-160 cubic meters of fuel when it broke down,** not 100 meters.  This directly contradicts option B.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

* **A: Maal uthaane se pehle jahaaz toota tha** (The ship broke down before loading cargo) - The passage states it was *going* to collect its usual food supplies, implying it hadn't loaded them yet.
* **C: Chaalak dull ke baarah sadso me se sirf ke chot lagi thi** (Only one member of the twelve crew members was injured) - The passage explicitly says ""kewal ek vyakti ke naka tooti hui thi."" (only one person's nose was broken).
* **D: Jahaaz ko baandh me dhakela gaya tha** (The ship was pushed into the harbor) - The passage states ""tez havaaon aur laharonne ise baandh mein dhakel diya"" (strong winds and waves pushed it into the harbor).



"
Algeria ne kis dashak mein swatantra haseel ki?,"The correct answer is **C: 1960**.

The passage states: ""1960 ke dashak mein film nirdeshan sikhaane ke liye wah naye swatantra hue algeria vaapas aa gaye."" (In the 1960s, he returned to newly independent Algeria to teach film direction.)

This directly implies Algeria gained independence in the 1960s. While the Algerian War of Independence began in the 1950s, full independence was achieved in 1962, placing it firmly within the 1960s decade."
Kahan antim sanskar ke liye television screen nhi lagaye gye the?,"Sahi jawab hai **D: St. Peter Square mein**.

P passage mein bataya gaya hai ki St. Peter's Square mein log itne zyada the ki har kisi ke liye pahunch pana mumkin nahi tha, isliye television screen nahi lagaye gaye. Television screen Rome ke alag-alag jagahon, Italy ke any shaharon, aur Poland mein lagaye gaye the taaki log samanroh dekh sakein."
Antim sanskar kahan hua tha?,"The correct answer is **C: St. Peter Square mein**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...cent peters square mein antim sanskar ke liye har kisi ke pahunch panna mumkin nahin tha."" (It wasn't possible for everyone to reach St. Peter's Square for the funeral). While the event was *also* shown on screens in other locations (Rome, Italy, Poland), the funeral *itself* took place in St. Peter's Square.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Rome ki alag-alag jagahon mein** - While screens were set up in various locations in Rome, the funeral wasn't happening simultaneously in all those places.
* **B: Poland mein** - Poland was a viewing location via screens, not the location of the funeral.
* **D: Pehle Rome mein fir dusri Italian shahar mein** - The passage doesn't indicate the funeral moved to another city."
"Visfot ke baad, gambhir roop se ghayal ke taur par kiska ilaaj kiya gaya?","The correct answer is **B: Kisi ka nahi**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Koi gambhir roop se ghayal nahin hua."" (No one was seriously injured). While five people were treated for shock, they weren't *seriously* injured.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kam se kam paanch logo ka** - They were treated for *shock*, not serious injuries.
*   **C: Gas company ke adhikar ka** - The passage doesn't mention the gas company official being injured.
*   **D: Ek padosi ka** - The neighbor *reported* the leak, but wasn't reported as injured.



"
Gas risaav ki report kisne ki?,"Correct answer is **A: Building mein ek padosi ne**

The passage states: ""Gas company ke ek adhikari ne **padosi dwara kiye gaye gas leak ke phone** ke chalte jagah ka dora kiya."" This directly translates to ""A gas company official visited the location after a gas leak call **made by a neighbor**.""

Therefore, a neighbor reported the gas leak."
"Passage ke hisaab se, hamle mein kitne log maare gaye?","The passage states the weapon malfunctioned when aimed at a fifth person. It doesn't say anyone *died*. It only details injuries to Edger Veguilla and Kristofferr Schneider. 

Therefore, the answer is **B: 2** because while Schneider suffered extensive injuries, the passage does not mention any deaths. The question is asking about deaths, not injuries."
Hamle ke dauraan ek mauke par kiska hathiyaar fire nahi kar paya?,"The correct answer is **C: Schneider**.

The text states: ""Unka ka hathiyar tab vifal ho gaya jab paanchven vyakti ke sir par nishana lagaya."" (Their weapon failed when aimed at the fifth person's head). This refers to Schneider, as the following sentence details the injuries he sustained.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **Cuddeback:** He was the driver, not the one whose weapon malfunctioned.
*   **Una:** This name isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **Alden:** Nicholaus Eldon was present, but the text doesn't say his weapon malfunctioned.



"
Kaunse khel ko olympic karyakram se bahar kar diya gaya tha?,"The correct answer is **C: Baseball**.

The passage states: ""Baseball aur Softball ne olympic karyakram mein jagah banaane ka prayaas kiya, jinhen (baseball aur softball) 2005 mein olympic khelo se baahar kar diya gaya tha.""  This directly translates to ""Baseball and Softball tried to make a place in the Olympic program, which were removed from the Olympic games in 2005."""
Antarrashtriya Olympic Committee ne kis khel ko khelo mein shamil karne ke liye matdan kiya?,"The correct answer is **C: Rugby union**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Rugby khaas taur par rugby union aur golf ko olympic mein bhaag lene ke liye paanch khelo mein se chuna gaya."" (Rugby, especially rugby union, and golf were chosen from five sports to participate in the Olympics.)

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rollersports** - Mentioned as one of the sports *trying* to get in, but not selected.
*   **B: Baseball** - Also trying to get in, but not selected.
*   **D: Softball** - Also trying to get in, but not selected.



"
Arthur Guinness ne Saint James' Gate Brewery ko kitne saalo ke liye lease par diya?,"Correct answer is **D: 9000**

The text clearly states: ""24 September, 1759 ko, Arthur Guinness Dublin, Ireland mein Saint James' Gate Brewery ke liye **9,000 saal** ke lease par hastakshar kiye."" (On September 24, 1759, Arthur Guinness signed a **9,000-year** lease for the Saint James' Gate Brewery in Dublin, Ireland.)"
Guinness har saal kitne billion dollars kamata hai?,"Correct answer is **C: 14**

The text states Guinness makes over 10 billion euro which is equivalent to 14.7 billion American dollars *per year*.  The closest option to 14.7 is 14."
European sangh ke kitne desho mein H5N1 virus ki pushti ki gayi hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Saat** (Seven).

The text states: ""Australia, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece aur Italy ke baad France European sangh ka saatvaan desh hai, jo is virus ki maar jhel rahaa hai."" This translates to: ""After Australia, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece and Italy, France is the seventh country in the European Union to be affected by the virus.""

Therefore, H5N1 has been confirmed in seven countries within the European Union.



"
H5N1 virus ka sabse naya mamla kahan paya gaya tha?,"The correct answer is **A: France**.

The passage states: ""H5N1, manushyon ko bird flue ke ghaatak hone ki pushti ki gayi hai, jo somwar ko France ke poorv mein Lyon ke paas daldali bhoomi mein paya gaya hai."" (H5N1, confirmed to be fatal to humans from bird flu, was found on Monday in a wetland near Lyon in eastern France.)
"
shanti sainikon ke karan phailane se pehle Haiti ka is bimari se aakhiri bar samna kab hua tha?,"सही जवाब है **A: 1800 के दशक में**।

टेक्स्ट में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि टुकड़ियों के पहुँचने से पहले, 1800 के दशक से हैती को कभी भी बीमारियों से जुड़ी समस्याओं का सामना नहीं करना पड़ा था।"
Kis jagah ke kachare ne bimari ko badhne me yogdaan dia?,"सही उत्तर है: **B: संयुक्त राष्ट्र के शिविर**

टेक्स्ट में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि संयुक्त राष्ट्र के शिविर से निकलने वाले कचरे को ठीक से साफ नहीं किया गया, जिसके कारण बैक्टीरिया आर्टिबोनाइट नदी की सहायक नदी में प्रवेश कर गया और बीमारी फैली। 

अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि:

*   **A: आर्टिबोनाइट नदी** - नदी स्वयं स्रोत नहीं थी, बल्कि वह माध्यम थी जिससे बीमारी फैली।
*   **C: 2010 के भूकंप की जगह ने** - भूकंप ने स्थिति को बदतर बनाया, लेकिन बीमारी का स्रोत नहीं था।
*   **D: Haitian Institute for Justice and Democracy** - यह एक संस्थान है जिसने अध्ययन किया, लेकिन कचरा उत्पन्न नहीं किया।"
Irish sarkar kya karne ki yojana bana rahi hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Davayion ki anumati dene par adhik kathor kaanoon laagoo karne ki** (To implement stricter laws regarding drug approvals).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The Irish government is emphasizing the *necessity of parliamentary law to improve the situation*. A government spokesperson said it's important to implement the law quickly from both *public health and criminal justice perspectives*.  The health minister also expressed concern about people exploiting the temporary legality of certain elements, and transferring drug-related ideas to future generations.
* **This indicates:** The government is concerned about the legal status of drugs and its impact on public health and crime. They want to change the laws to be stricter, likely regarding approvals and control.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nashili Davayion ke aparaadhiyon ko saza sunane ki** (To punish drug offenders) - While criminal justice is mentioned, the focus is on the *laws themselves* and their impact, not just punishment.
* **C: Davayion ke kanoon me dheel dene ki** (To relax drug laws) - The passage explicitly states the opposite - a need for stricter laws.
* **D: davayion ko apradh mukht karne ki** (To decriminalize drugs) - This is also the opposite of what the passage suggests.



"
Ireland mein asthaayee roop se kya vaidh tha?,"The correct answer is **D: Dawaiyan (Medicines)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Swaasthya mantri ne ismein shamil tatvon ke asthaayi vaidhata ka faayada uthaane waale logon ke kalyan ke liye chinta zaahir ki...""  This translates to ""The Health Minister expressed concern for people benefiting from the temporary validity of elements *within it*...""  The ""it"" refers to the parliamentary law being pushed, and the ""elements"" are related to medicine (""dawa se judi dhaaranaon"").  Therefore, medicines were temporarily legal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sendhmari (River name - not related to the text)**
*   **B: Dhokhadhadi (Fraud - not mentioned as being temporarily legal)**
*   **C: Marna (To die - not related to the text)**



"
Sandigdh aparadhi se poochtach kis liye ke jaati hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Atikraman ke lie (For trespassing)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Los Angeles police vibhaag ke ek pravakta Christopher Garcia ne kahaa ki sandigdh purush aparadhi ki gundagiri ke **bajaay atikraman ke liye jaanch ke jaa rahi hai**.""  This directly translates to ""Los Angeles police spokesperson Christopher Garcia said that they are investigating the suspect for **trespassing** instead of gangsterism.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shaaririk roop se kshatigrast hone ki jaanch karne ke lie (To investigate physical harm):** The passage explicitly states the victim wasn't physically harmed.
* **C: Barbarata ke lie (For vandalism):** While there was alteration of a sign, the focus of the investigation is *not* vandalism, but trespassing.
* **D: Chori ke lie (For theft):** The passage doesn't mention anything about theft.



"
"Sanket me badlav karte samay, sandigdh ko kya nahi karna chahiye?","The correct answer is **A: Uske kisi akshar me badlav nahi karna chahiye** (He shouldn't change any of its letters).

Here's why:

The passage states the sign was *altered* by changing ""O"" to ""E"" and decorating it with peace and heart symbols.  The question asks what the suspect *shouldn't* do when changing the sign. Therefore, the correct answer is that they shouldn't change any letters at all.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shanti chinh se sajana chahiye** (Should be decorated with a peace symbol) - The passage states this *was* done, not what should be done.
* **C: shaaririk roop se kshatigrast karna chahiye** (Should be physically damaged) - The passage explicitly states the sign was *not* physically damaged.
* **D: Tirpal istemal karke sansodhit kiya jana chahiye** (Should be modified using tarpaulin) - The passage states tarpaulin was *used* to make the modification, not that it should be used.



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, angreji ke tutor Karno par inmein se kaunsa aarop nahin tha?","Sahi jawab hai **B: Ek chhatra ke sath dating**.

Passage mein yeh kaha gaya hai ki Karno apne notes mein dating kaushal sikhata tha, lekin yeh nahi kaha gaya ki unhone kisi chhatra ke sath dating ki.

Baaki sabhi aarop passage mein diye gaye hain:

*   **A: Copyright ullanghan** - Passage mein kaha gaya hai ki un par pehle bhi copyright ullanghan ka aarop lagaya jaa chuka hai.
*   **C: anadhikrit vigyapan chhapna** - Passage mein kaha gaya hai ki aadhunik shiksha ne un par adhikar ke binaa bus par badey vigyaapan chhaapne ka aarop lagaya.
*   **D: Class mein abhadra bhasha istemal karna** - Passage mein kaha gaya hai ki unhone aise shabdon ka istemal kiya, jinhen kuch maataa-pita bhadda maante the aur kathit taur par unhone kaksha mein apavitrata ka istemal kiya, aur ek poorv chhatr ne kaha ki wah 'class mein gaali deta tha'."
"Passage ke hisab se, Rolando Mendoza ne kise apna bandhak nahi banaya?","Sahi javab hai **D: Photographers ko**.

Passage mein bataya gaya hai ki filipino photographers ko jaldi chhod diya gaya, aur unhone baad mein ek vriddh mahila ki jagah le li. Iska matlab hai ki Mendoza ne unhe bandhak nahi banaya.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Paryatakon ko** - Passage mein saaf-saaf bataya gaya hai ki Mendoza ne Hong Kong ke paryatakon ko bandhak banaya tha.
*   **B: Policewalo ko** - Although the passage doesn't explicitly say Mendoza held police hostage, it implies a confrontation with authorities and the situation began with a former police officer.
*   **C: Bachhe** - Passage mein bataya gaya hai ki bachchon ko jaldi chhod diya gaya tha, lekin iska matlab yeh nahi hai ki unhe bandhak nahi banaya gaya tha. Unhe bandhak banaya gaya tha, lekin jaldi chhod diya gaya.



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, kin bandhako ko jaldi chhodne ki chhodne ki pushti nahi ki gayi?","सही उत्तर है **A: Paryatakon**

Passage में यह स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि बच्चों, बुजुर्गों और फ़िलिपिनो फ़ोटोग्राफ़र्स को जल्द ही छोड़ दिया गया। लेकिन यह नहीं बताया गया है कि बाकी पर्यटको को कब छोड़ा गया, इसलिए यह उत्तर सही है।"
"Passage ke hisaab se, Brazil mein samlaingik vivaah ko vaidh banaane ke support mein kaun hastakshar ekatra kar raha hai?","The correct answer is **A: Pradarshankari (Protestors)**.

The passage states: ""Pradarshankariyon ko aashaa hai ki wo november mein rashtriya congress ke samne prastut karne ke liye 12 lakh hastakshar ekatra karke ek yachika bana lenge."" (Protestors hope to collect 1.2 million signatures to present a petition to the national congress in November.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Roberto Jefferson:** He *has* the proposed law, but isn't collecting signatures.
* **C: Roman Catholic church:** The passage explicitly states the church *opposes* same-sex marriage.
* **D: Marta Suplicy:** She *drafted* the original bill, but isn't currently collecting signatures.



"
Pradarshankari apni yachika kise denge?,"The correct answer is **C: Brazil ki rashtriya congress**.

The text states: ""Pradarshankariyon ko aashaa hai ki wo november mein rashtriya congress ke samne prastut karne ke liye 12 lakh hastakshar ekatra karke ek yachika bana lenge.""  This directly translates to ""Protestors hope to collect 1.2 million signatures to create a petition to present to the national congress in November.""



"
"Armand Versace ke hisaab se, bhid dwara mausam par pratikriya dene se thik pehle kya hua tha?","The correct answer is **A: Ole girne lage** (Hail began to fall).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""phir akash se ole girte hain, log ghabraate hain, chillaate hain aur afratfari mach jaati hai. Armand Versace kahaa, meine apni behen auruski dost ko kho diya...""

This clearly shows the hail (ole) falling *immediately before* Armand Versace reports losing his sister and her friend, and before the chaos begins.  The passage describes the hail as happening *before* the panic and the description of the disabled people being trampled.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pradarshan paanch minute deri se hua** - The passage states the wind started *within* five minutes of the show starting, not that it was delayed.
* **C: Tez hawa chal rahi thi** - The strong wind happened *before* the hail, not the other way around.
* **D: Usne family ke ek member ko kho diya** - Losing his family member happened *after* the hail started causing panic.



"
"Versace ke hisaab se, sabse tez hawaein kab shuru hui?","The correct answer is **D: Ole girne se phele**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pradarshan chalu hone ke paanch minute mein hawa shuru ho jaati hai, lagbhag ek minute baad, hawa 70 kilometer/ghanta tak pahunch rahi hai... phir barish aati hai, lekin itni tez aur itni badi booden ki yah aapaki twacha ko sui ke tarah chubhati hai, phir akash se ole girte hain...""

This clearly indicates the strong winds (70 km/h) started *before* the hail (ole) began to fall. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pradarshan chalu hone ke kuch minute baad** - While the wind started shortly after the show began, the *strongest* winds were later.
*   **B: Barish ke baad** - The wind was already strong before the rain started.
*   **C: Apni behen ko khone ke baad** - Losing his sister is a separate event and doesn't relate to when the wind was at its strongest.



"
Fred se phele 35°W ke poorv mein kitne bade toofan record kiye gaye hain?,"The correct answer is **B: Teen**.

The text states: ""Satellite imagery ke aagaman ke baad se fried atlantic mein ab tak dakshin aur poorv mein darj sabse shaktishali ushnakatibandhiya chakravaat hai aur 35°W ke poorv mein kewal teesara pramukh toofan record hai."" 

This translates to: ""Since the advent of satellite imagery, Fried has been the most powerful tropical cyclone recorded in the south and east in the Atlantic and is only the third major storm recorded east of 35°W.""

Therefore, two other major storms were recorded before Fried east of 35°W. Adding Fried itself makes it three. So the answer is Teen (three)."
"Jab Fred, Cape verde dveepon ke paas aaya tha, to vah kis disha ki or badh raha tha?","The correct answer is **D: Uttar-paschim** (North-west).

The text states: ""is samay fried 105 mile prati ghante (165 kilo meter prati ghanta) ki hawa ke gati se **uttar-paschim** ki or badh raha hai."" (at this time Fred is moving towards the **north-west** at a wind speed of 105 miles per hour)."
Inmein se kiski gati apne poorvavartiyon ki tulana mein tez hai?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The passage explicitly states: ""600 megabit/second ke adhikatam theoretical throughput ke saath 802.11n ke gati apne pehle vaale chalakon se ullekhaniya roop se bahut tez hai."" (With a maximum theoretical throughput of 600 megabits/second, the speed of 802.11n is significantly much faster than its predecessors.)

The passage doesn't mention 802.11b, 802.11g, or 802.11a being faster than their predecessors – in fact, 802.11n is *backwards compatible* with them, meaning it can work *with* them but isn't faster *than* them overall."
802.11n ko 802.11b ke sath sangat karne ke lie kya chiz jaruri hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Dual radio**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""802.11n...will allow it to backward compatibility with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, *provided the base station has dual radios*.""  This means having two radios (one for each frequency band - 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz) is necessary for 802.11n to work with older standards like 802.11b.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bahut tez gati (Very fast speed)** - While 802.11n *has* faster speeds, speed itself isn't the requirement for compatibility.
*   **B: 802.11b ki 5.0ghz par sanchaalit hone ki kshamata (802.11b's ability to operate on 5.0ghz)** - 802.11b operates on 2.4 GHz, not 5.0 GHz.
*   **C: 600Mbit/s ka throughput (600Mbit/s throughput)** - This is the *maximum* speed of 802.11n, not a requirement for compatibility with older standards.



"
Olympic swarna padak vijeta ko rashtramandal khelon mein kitani spardhaon mein bhaag lena tha?,"The correct answer is **A: Paanch**

Here's why:

The passage states the athlete was to compete in:

*   100 meter freestyle
*   200 meter freestyle
*   Three relay events

That's a total of 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 competitions."
Olympic swarna padak vijeta apne dard ki davaa kyon nahi le raha tha?,"The correct answer is **D: Rashtramandal khelon mein ise lene ki anumati nhi thi** (It was not allowed to be taken in the Commonwealth Games).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the swimmer couldn't take the necessary medication because ""way davaaiyaan khelon mein pratibandhit thi"" (those medicines were prohibited in the Games).  This directly answers the question of why he wasn't taking the pain medication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Use koi dard nahi hua** (He had no pain) - The passage says he had complaints and pain.
*   **B: Isse uski tabiyat kharab ho gai** (It made his health worse) - The passage doesn't say the medication made him sick, only that he couldn't take it.
*   **C: Use chinta thi iska uski sehat par bura prabhav padega** (He was worried it would negatively affect his health) - The passage states the *reason* he couldn't take it was because it was prohibited, not because of worry about side effects.



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, bhookamp gatividhi ke baare mein bhram ki sambhavana kya ho sakti hain?","The correct answer is **A: kale baadlon ka maujood hona**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Parvat ke taraai mein kisi bhi jwalamukhiya gatividhi se asambandhit kale baadlon ki suchna di gayee. Baadlon se bhram ke sambhavana paida hui, ki vakai mein visfot hua tha."" 

This translates to: ""Information was given about dark clouds unrelated to any volcanic activity in the mountain foothills. The possibility of confusion arose from the clouds, that an eruption had actually occurred.""

Therefore, the presence of dark clouds is what led to the possibility of a misconception about seismic activity (thinking an eruption had happened).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Icelandic mausam vigyaan karyalaya se report milna** - The report stated *no* seismic activity, which would *reduce* confusion, not create it.
* **C: Antarrashtriya bhookamp nakshe** - The map showed no earthquakes in the first week, again reducing confusion.
* **D: Iceland ke dusro hisso me bhukamp ki report hona** - The passage doesn't mention earthquakes in other parts of Iceland causing confusion."
"Passage ke hisaab se, phase me badlav kab hota hai?","The correct answer is **C: 10 March ko**.

The passage states: ""Tez bhookamp gatividhi ke parinamswarup isthiti parivartan **10 march** ko jwalamukhi ke shikhar caldera ke uttar-poorv ki or hua tha.""  This translates to: ""Due to increased seismic activity, the state change occurred on **March 10th** towards the northeast of the volcano's summit caldera.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 10th March se phele:** The passage states the change *happened* on March 10th, not before.
*   **B: Pichle 48 ghanton mein:** This refers to the lack of seismic activity reported by the Icelandic Meteorological Office.
*   **D: Pichle saptah se pehle:** This refers to the initial observation of no earthquakes in Iceland by the USGS.



"
Chandrayaan-1 ki lunar probe ke baare mein inmein se kaun sa kathan satya nahin hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Orbiter ko launch karne vale probe mein ek crew tha** (The probe launched by the orbiter had a crew).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states ""Maanav rahit lunar orbit chandrayan -1""** which means Chandrayaan-1 was a *humanless* (unmanned) mission. Therefore, the probe launched from it could not have had a crew.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

* **B: Probe me zaruri instrument the** (The probe had necessary instruments) - The passage states it carried ""Teen mahatvapurn vaigyaanik upkaranon"" (three important scientific instruments).
* **C: Probe ke ejection safaltapoorvak hua** (The probe's ejection was successful) -  The passage says the MIPS was ""safaltapurvak chand ke dakshini dhruv par utra"" (successfully landed on the south pole of the moon), implying a successful ejection.
* **D: Probe ki sides me paint hua tha** (The probe was painted on its sides) - The passage mentions ""bhartiya rashtriya dhwaj bhi tha jo ki sabhi aur chitrit tha"" (the Indian national flag was also there, which was painted on all sides).



"
Inmein se kaunsa kathan lunar probe ko satik roop se darshata hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Uski crash landing safal rahi** (Its crash landing was successful).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""safaltapurvak chand ke dakshini dhruv par utra tha"" which translates to ""successfully landed on the south pole of the moon."" While it was a *controlled impact* and thus a ""crash landing"", the passage emphasizes its success.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vah Chandrama ki uttari dhruv ke pass utra tha** (It landed near the north pole of the moon) - The passage states it landed on the *south* pole.
* **C: Maanav rahit lunar orbit ko bahar nikala tha** (It was removed from lunar orbit) - The probe was *released* from the orbiter, not removed.
* **D: Isme do mahatvapurn upkaran the** (It had two important instruments) - The passage states it carried *three* important instruments.



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, bimari se bachav ka kaunsa upaay sabse aakhir mein kiya jaega?","The correct answer is **C: Encephalitis vaccine**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sarkarne encephalitis vaccine ke kayee million vial ka vaadaa kiya hai, jo agle saal swaasthya agencies ko taiyar karne mein madad karegi.""  This clearly indicates the vaccine will be available *next year*, making it the last of the mentioned measures to be implemented.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: keetnashakon ka istemal (use of pesticides):** The passage states pesticides were *already* used as a measure taken due to the outbreak.
* **B: Suar pakadane vaale (pig catchers):**  The passage says pig catchers were *deployed* as a response to the outbreak.
* **D: Machhardani (mosquito nets):**  The passage states thousands of mosquito nets were *distributed*.

Therefore, the vaccine is the only measure promised for the future, making it the last to be implemented."
Bimari manushyon mein kaise aati hain?,"The correct answer is **A: Machharon se** (From mosquitoes).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""yah bimari suaron ke karan hoti hai, jo baad mein machharon ke madhyam se manushyon mein aati hai."" (This disease is caused by pigs, which later spreads to humans through mosquitoes.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: keetnashakon ka istemal** (Use of pesticides) - Pesticides are a *response* to the disease, not how it's *transmitted*.
*   **C: Suaron se** (From pigs) - While pigs are the *source* of the disease, the passage clearly states it's transmitted *by* mosquitoes.
*   **D: Suar pakadane vaale** (Pig catchers) - Pig catchers are deployed as a control measure, not the way the disease spreads."
Dusri saza ki viphalata ke kya parinaam ho sakata hai?,"The correct answer is **B: samlingi naagarik sanghon ka bhavishy ka adhikaar (the future rights of same-sex civil unions)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Isse aane waale samay mein samalingi kanooni maanyata waale rishton ke liye ummid jagi hai."" (This has raised hope for same-sex civil unions in the future.)  The failure of the second clause (which banned same-sex civil unions) *creates* that hope and a potential for future rights.
* **HJR-3's review (A)** is a *process* that happens because of the failure, it isn't the direct *result* of it.
* **C and D** are not mentioned in the passage at all and are therefore incorrect.

Therefore, the most direct consequence of the second clause's failure is the increased possibility of legal recognition for same-sex relationships in the future.



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, doosri saza ko kab hataya gaya?","The correct answer is **C: Somavaar ko**.

The passage explicitly states: ""dusri saza pehle house of representatives dwara khatm kar dee gayee aur phir somwar ko senate ne use roop mein paas kiya."" (The second clause was eliminated by the House of Representatives and then passed by the Senate in that form on Monday.)



"
“Panama Papers” kiske liye leak hue the?,"Correct answer is **B: Press**.

The passage clearly states: ""Panama papers...jise sun 2016 ke vasant mein **press ko leak kar diya gaya tha**."" (Panama papers...which were leaked to the **press** in the spring of 2016).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mossack Fonseca firm:** The papers *belonged* to this firm, but they weren't leaked *to* the firm.
*   **C: Deutsche Bank:** Deutsche Bank was *involved* as a user of shell companies, but not the recipient of the leak.
*   **D: Iceland ke sarkari netaa:** The leaders resigned *as a result* of the leak, they didn't receive the leak itself.



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, British akhbar ne daava kiya tha ki dhan chhupaane ke lie istemaal ki jane vali kai comaniyon ka prabandhan kaun kar raha tha?","The correct answer is **C: Deutsche Bank**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""British akhbar The Guardian ke anusaar duetsche bank ne ise pura karne ke liye istemal ki jaane waali 1200 shell companiyon mein se ek tihai ko mote taur par niyantrit kiya.""  (According to the British newspaper The Guardian, Deutsche Bank controlled about a third of the 1200 shell companies used to accomplish this.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kai banks ke ameer grahak (wealthy clients of several banks):** While the *purpose* of the shell companies was to hide money for wealthy clients, the passage specifically says Deutsche Bank controlled them.
* **B: Panama ke kanooni firm (Panama legal firm):** Mossack Fonseca was the firm *involved* in the leak, but the passage says Deutsche Bank controlled the companies.
* **D: Pakistan ki sarkar (Pakistan government):** The passage only mentions that leaders in Pakistan resigned *as a result* of the papers, not that they controlled the companies.



"
Inmein se kis vimaan durghatana mein sabase adhik mauten huin?,"The correct answer is **A: Iran se Armenia ja rahe plane crash mein**.

The text states that the plane crash heading to Armenia resulted in the death of 168 people, which is significantly higher than the casualties in the other accidents mentioned.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Iran se Armenia ja rahe plane crash:** 168 deaths
*   **Police ke helicopter crash:** 3 deaths
*   **Mashhad mein hue plane crash:** 17 deaths"
Iran mein hone vali anek hawai durghatanaon ka inmein se kaunsa karan nahin hai?,"Sahi jawab hai **B: Naye vimaan khareedane ke liye budget ki**.

Paaragraph mein kaha gaya hai ki antarrashtriya pratibandhon ke karan naye vimaan nahin khareede ja sakte, budget ki kami ka zikr nahin hai. Baaki sabhi options (purane vimaan, pratibandh, maintenance ki kami) paragraph mein hawai durghatnaon ke karan ke roop mein diye gaye hain."
Inmein se kya Iraq adhyayan samooh ki report mein shaamil nahin tha?,"Correct answer is **B: Ek ghoshana ki kuchh badlavon ke sath iraq mein badhti hinsa se bacha ja sakata hai**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the report *warns* that no one can guarantee actions will curb sectarian violence, increasing bloodshed or chaos. It doesn't offer a *declaration* that violence can be averted with changes – it expresses uncertainty and a need for a different approach.

Let's look at why the other options are correct and found within the passage:

*   **A: Vartamaan neeti ki aalochana (Criticism of current policy):** The passage says the report is ""behad aalochanatmak"" (highly critical) of the administration's current policy.
*   **C: Iraq ki seemaon ko surakshit karne ki sifaarishen (Recommendations to secure Iraq's borders):** The first suggestion is to secure Iraq's borders.
*   **D: America ki sehmati banane ke liye ek yachika (A plea to build American consensus):** The report ""opens with a plea"" for open debate and building consensus in the US."
Iraq adhyayan samooh ne apni report mein inmein se kiska aagrah nahin kiya tha?,"The correct answer is **A: Badhti hinsa ko rokane ki gaurantee vali ghoshna ne** (A guarantee to stop increasing violence).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the report *warns* that no one can guarantee a halt to sectarian violence, increased violence, or chaos in Iraq. It doesn't *advocate* for a guarantee of stopping violence. Instead, it acknowledges the uncertainty.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nirdesho me hue turant badlavo ne** (Immediate changes in direction): The passage says the report ""urges immediate changes in direction.""
* **C: Khuli bahas ne** (Open discussion): The passage mentions the report ""opens with a plea for open debate.""
* **D: Nai kootnitik pahal ki shuruat ne** (Initiation of a new diplomatic initiative): The passage states the first suggestion is to begin a new diplomatic initiative.



"
"Police ke hisaab se, Provenzano ka dahina haath kise mana jata hai?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

The passage states: ""Police ne kahaa ki lo piccolo ki sthiti maboot thi kyonki wah palermo mein provenzano ka dahina haath tha..."" which translates to ""Police said that Lo Piccolo's position was strong because he was Provenzano's right-hand man in Palermo...""

Therefore, Lo Piccolo is identified as Provenzano's right-hand man according to the police.



"
"Passage mai di gai jaankari ke hisaab se, Falcone ki maut ki kya vajah thi?","The correct answer is **A: Reena-dwara sanchaalit yuddh ke dauraan mara gaya tha**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...1992 mein rajya ke viruddh reena-dwara sanchaalit yuddh ko samaapt kiya jismein mafia yoddha Giovanni Falcone aur Paolo Borsellino ki jaan chali gayi thi.""  This translates to: ""...ended the war waged against the state by Reena in 1992, in which mafia fighters Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino lost their lives.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Police dwara mara gaya tha:** The passage doesn't mention police involvement in Falcone's death.
* **C: Lo Piccolo ko use marne ka order diya gaya tha:** The passage mentions Lo Piccolo's position, but not his involvement in Falcone's death.
* **D: Use saathi Mafia crusader Paolo Borsellino ne maar dala tha:** The passage states both Falcone *and* Borsellino died in the conflict, so Borsellino couldn't have killed Falcone.



"
Inmein se kaun Hitoshi Saito ki prashansaon mein se ek nahin hai?,"Correct answer is **C: Do baar ke olympic gold medals ke vijeta**

Here's why:

The passage states Hitoshi Saito was an Olympic gold medalist (singular), not a two-time Olympic gold medalist. The passage *does* mention he was a former world champion and the chairman of the All Japan Judo Federation training committee. He was undoubtedly a Judo expert due to his achievements. 

Therefore, option C is the only statement that is *not* true based on the provided text."
Iwasaki pratigya lene se bachane mein kahan safal rahi?,"The passage states Iwasaki escaped from a wedding in Nepal. Therefore, Iwasaki was successful in avoiding a vow (pratigya) in **Nepal**.

The correct answer is **B: Nepal**."
Iwasaki par kisne attack kiya tha?,"The correct answer is **B: Samudri daakuon ne** (Sea pirates).

The passage (P) explicitly states: ""Use samudri daakuonne lootaa tha"" which translates to ""He was looted by sea pirates.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uske hone vale pati ne** (His future husband) - The passage mentions he ran away from a wedding in Nepal, implying trouble *related* to the wedding, but doesn't say his future husband attacked him.
*   **C: Kutte ne** (Dog) - While a mad dog *attacked* him in Tibet, this isn't the overall attack referred to in the question.
*   **D: Police ne** (Police) - He was *arrested* by police in India, not attacked.



"
Alonso ne apni race kab samaapt kari?,"The correct answer is **A: Schumacher ke samne wala pahiya toot jaane par** (When Schumacher's front wheel broke).

Here's why:

The text states Alonso stopped ""thik baad"" (immediately after) his pit stop, and ""shayed isliye kyonki samne wala pahiya buri tarah se sikud gaya tha"" (perhaps because his front wheel was badly damaged).  This directly links his retirement to the wheel issue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fisichella ke apni car se control kho jane par** - Fisichella's crash happened *before* Alonso's retirement.
* **C: Schumacher dwara apni race samaapt karne par** - Schumacher stopped *after* Alonso.
* **D: Lead lene se phele** - The text doesn't say anything about Alonso losing the lead. It only says he was ahead for most of the race.



"
Schumacher ka apni race jaldi samaapt karne ka kya karan tha?,"The correct answer is **D: Car ke suspension ko kshati pahunchi thi**.

The text explicitly states: ""Michael Schumacher ne alonso ke kuch samay baad hi apni race samaapt kar di thi kayonki race ke dauran kayi sangharshon mein suspension ko kshati pahunchi thi."" (Michael Schumacher finished his race shortly after Alonso because his suspension was damaged in several collisions during the race).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Usne apni car par niyantran kho diya:** This happened to Fisichella, not Schumacher.
* **B: Alonso se takkar ho gai:** While there were collisions, the text specifies the damage was to the *suspension*, not a direct collision with Alonso that ended his race.
* **C: Fisichella ki vajah se pahiya toot gaya:** Fisichella's incident was separate from Schumacher's.



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, giraftar logon ke liye jamanat karne ka kaam kiska hai?","The correct answer is **D: Court ke commissioner ka** (Court Commissioner).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Agar giraftaar karne waale adhikari dwara darj kiye gaye aaropon ko aupchaarik roop aur anumati dee jaati hai, tab aayukt jamaanat pradaan karta hai.""  This directly translates to ""If the charges filed by the arresting officer are formalized and approved, the commissioner grants bail.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Giraftaar karne wale adhikari ke** (Arresting Officer): The officer *files* the charges, but doesn't grant bail.
*   **B: Judge Glynn ka** (Judge Glynn): Judge Glynn issued a temporary restraining order, but doesn't directly grant bail in this process.
*   **C: Central booking facility ka** (Central Booking Facility): The facility released people, but that was *after* a process involving the commissioner, not because they themselves granted bail.



"
"Passage mein ullikhit asthayi nirodhak aadesh ke hisab se, giraftar kie gaye logon ko 24 ghante se adhik samay tak hirasat mein rakhne ke lie kya anumati di jani chahiye?","The correct answer is **A: Jamanat**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the temporary restraining order issued by Judge Glynn prohibits holding people for more than 24 hours *who have not been brought before a court commissioner*. The court commissioner grants bail *if* the charges filed by the arresting officer are formalized and approved. Therefore, to legally hold someone for more than 24 hours, bail (jamanat) needs to be granted.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Giraftar karne wale adhikari ke sath mulakat (Meeting with the arresting officer):**  The passage doesn't mention a meeting as a requirement for extended detention.
*   **C: Judge Glynn dwara jaari kiye gaye samanya shulk (General fee issued by Judge Glynn):** The order is a *restraining order*, not a fee.
*   **D: Sunvai (Hearing):** While a hearing date is eventually set, it's *after* the initial 24-hour period and after bail is potentially granted.  The order specifically addresses detention *before* being presented to the commissioner for a hearing.



"
Passage ke anusaar naa bhaagne ki kaun si vajah nhi di gayi thi?,"Correct answer is **B: Samvidhaan ka virodhabhas**.

Here's why:

The passage states that politicians found ""sufficient ambiguity"" in the Afghan constitution that would allow them to determine the decisive vote unnecessarily. It also mentions cost and security risks as reasons for not fleeing. However, it **doesn't** say that avoiding a constitutional contradiction was a reason for not fleeing. In fact, it *contradicts* previous reports that said canceling the decisive vote would be unconstitutional.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Suraksha jokhim (Security risk)** - The passage explicitly states security risk was a reason.
*   **C: Zyada kharch (High cost)** - The passage explicitly states election cost was a reason.
*   **D: Samvidhaan mein kafi aspashtata (Sufficient ambiguity in the constitution)** - The passage explicitly mentions this as a reason."
Raajnitigyon ne kyu bhaagne ko anavashayak tehraya?,"The correct answer is **C: Samvidhaan mein aspashtata thi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Raajnitigyon ne kahaa ki unhone nirnaayak matt ko anaavashyak roop se nirdhaarit karne ke liye afghan samvidhaan mein kafi aspashtata paayi thi."" This directly translates to ""Politicians said they found enough ambiguity in the Afghan constitution to determine the decisive vote unnecessarily.""  This explains *why* they considered running unnecessary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yah samvidhaan ke viroddh gya** - The passage actually *contradicts* previous reports that said cancelling the vote *would* be unconstitutional.
*   **B: Surakhsha jokhim tha** - Security risk is mentioned as a reason officials decided *not* to run, not why politicians deemed running unnecessary.
*   **D: Chunaav bahut jyada kharcila tha** -  The high cost of the election is also a reason given for officials not running, not politicians.



"
FATA ko nyaayik sevaayen kaun pradaan karta hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Raajneetik agents**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""raajneetik agents"" are responsible for providing governmental and judicial services under Article 247 of the Pakistani constitution in FATA.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pakistani sarkar** - While ultimately responsible, the passage says agents *provide* the services *for* the government.
* **C: Pakistan ke rashtrapati** - The president *appoints* the agents, but doesn't directly provide the services.
* **D: British sarkar** - The passage refers to the time *after* independence from British rule.



"
"""FATA ke """"raajneetik agents"""" ke baare mein niche diye gaye kathano mein se kaun sa sahi nhi hai?""","The correct answer is **C: Ve Pakistan ke samvidhaan ka paalan karte hain** (They follow the Pakistani Constitution).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states the agents operate *under* Article 247 of the Pakistani Constitution, but it doesn't say they operate *according to* the full Constitution.** Article 247 is a specific provision dealing with FATA's unique status and allows for a different administrative framework.  FATA historically operated with a significant degree of autonomy from standard constitutional law.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Ve nyaayik sevaayen pradaan karte hain (They provide judicial services):**  The passage explicitly states they are responsible for providing judicial services.
* **B: Ve Pakistani rashtrapati dware chune gye the (They were chosen by the Pakistani President):** The passage states the Pakistani President appointed them.
* **D: Unka kuch khaas area par pura niyantran hai (They have full control over a specific area):** The passage says they had ""almost full administrative control"" over the tribal areas.



Therefore, the statement that they fully follow the Pakistani Constitution is the one that is *not* supported by the information given in the passage."
Emma Stone ka namankan kis award ke liye hua tha?,"The correct answer is **A: Sarvshreshth sah-abhinetri (Best Supporting Actress)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gosling aur stone ko kramshah sarvshreshth abhineta aur abhinetri ke liye namankan mila hai"" which translates to ""Gosling and Stone were nominated for Best Actor and Best Actress respectively."" While the question asks for Emma Stone's nomination, it's worded as ""Best Supporting Actress"" which is a translation error. The context clearly shows she was nominated for Best Actress.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sarvshreshth director (Best Director)** - The director received a nomination, but not Emma Stone.
*   **C: Sarvshreshth abhineta (Best Actor)** - This was Ryan Gosling's nomination.
*   **D: Sarvshreshth film-sampadan (Best Film Editing)** - The film itself received a nomination for this, not Emma Stone.



"
Kis award ke liye film ka namankan nhi kiya gaya tha?,"The correct answer is **B: Sarvshreshth Visual Effects**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly lists all the nominations the film received. It includes:

*   Best Picture
*   Director
*   Cinematography
*   Costume Design
*   Film Editing
*   Original Score
*   Production Design
*   Sound Editing
*   Sound Mixing
*   Original Screenplay
*   Best Original Song (for two songs)
*   Best Actor (Gosling)
*   Best Actress (Stone)

Visual Effects are **not** mentioned in the list of nominations. Therefore, the film was not nominated for Best Visual Effects.

"
Niche diye gaye mein se kaun-sa bhookamp ke bad bhi karyarath tha?,"सही उत्तर है **D: Niigata ka power plant**।

टेक्स्ट में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि निगाटा प्रांत में काशिवाजाकी करीवा परमाणु ऊर्जा संयंत्र सामान्य रूप से काम कर रहा था, भले ही भूकंप आया हो।

अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि:

*   **A:** टेक्स्ट में बताया गया है कि शिका प्लांट के रिएक्टर नंबर 1 और 2 बंद कर दिए गए थे।
*   **B:** टेक्स्ट में कहा गया है कि इशिकावा प्रांत में नोटो हवाई अड्डा बंद था।
*   **C:** टेक्स्ट में कहा गया है कि प्रभावित क्षेत्रों में रेल सेवा बाधित हुई थी।"
Passage ke anusaar niche diye gaye mein se kaun bhookamp se hue nuksaan ko jhel gaye?,"The correct answer is **A: Kuch ghar** (Some homes).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ek report may bataaya gaya hai ki is kshetra 9400 ghar paani ki kamee se joojh rahe hai"" (a report stated that 9400 homes in the area are struggling with a water shortage). This means homes experienced a negative impact due to the earthquake.

Let's look at why the other options are not the *best* answer:

*   **B: Shika plant ke do reactor** (Two reactors of the Shika plant): While the reactors were *shut down* as a precaution, the passage doesn't state they were *damaged* by the earthquake.
*   **C: Kuch sadaken** (Some roads): The passage says roads were *damaged*, but the primary impact described is on homes due to water shortage.
*   **D: Noto Airport** (Noto Airport): The passage states the airport is *closed*, but this doesn't necessarily mean it sustained damage. It could be closed due to other reasons related to the earthquake's impact (like access issues).

Therefore, **A** is the most direct answer to the question of who ""suffered damage"" from the earthquake, as homes are specifically mentioned as struggling with a direct consequence (water shortage)."
"Passage ke anusaar, inmein se kaun si samasya dastaavez mein shaamil nhi hai?","Correct answer is **B: 1967 ke yuddha ki vajah**.

Here's why:

The passage clearly states the document concerns:

*   **Seema vivaad:** (Border dispute) - based on the 1967 borders.
*   **Jerusalem ka bhavishya:** (Future of Jerusalem) - a contested issue.
*   **Ghaati samasya:** (Jordan Valley issue) - a sensitive area.
*   **Sainya sthiti:** (Military presence) - Israel wants 10 years, PA wants 5.

However, the passage does *not* discuss the **cause of the 1967 war** itself. It only uses the 1967 borders as a reference point for the dispute.

Therefore, option B is the only issue *not* mentioned as being part of the document's contents."
Inmein se kaun si Palestine ki maang mein se nhi hai?,"Sahi jawab hai: **D: Jordan ghaati mein panch saal ki sainya mauzudgi**

Kyuki leak ke anusaar, Palestine (PA) Jordan ghaati mein sainya mauzoodgi ko kewal panch saal tak jaari rakhane ke liye sahmat hai, ise maang nahi kehta. Israel, vartamaan sainya sthiti ko agle dus salon tak banaae rakhane ki maang karta hai. Isliye, PA ki maang dus saal nahi, balki panch saal ki sainya mauzoodgi ki hai.

Baaki vishay (yuddh se poorva ki istithi par aadharit seemayein, Jerusalem ke bhavishya, aur Jordan ghaati mein vartamaan sainya mauzoodgi) Palestine ki maangon mein shaamil hain."
Ma ne kis desh mein law ki padhayi ki?,"The correct answer is **A: America**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ma ka janm hong kong mein hua tha, unhone new york vishvavidyalaya aur **harvard law school mein adhyayan kiya**...""  Harvard Law School is in America.

Therefore, Ma studied law in America.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, Ma ke chunaav ki jeet mein kis desh ka sath tha?","The correct answer is **D: Cheen (China)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""in aaropon ke bavjood, maane **chini mahadweep** ke saath ghanishth sambandhon ke vakalat karte hue ek munch par jeet hassil ki.""

This translates to: ""Despite the accusations, Ma won an election advocating for close ties with the **Chinese mainland**.""

Therefore, Ma's election victory was associated with support for China.



"
"Jaisa ki passage mein bataya gaya hai, Carolyn Wilson shehar chodne se pehle kiske liye kaam karte the?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""...achaanak pata chalaa ki OHA ke Carolyn Wilson ne unki suraksha jama raashi chura liye thi aur shahar se bhaag gaya tha."" This directly translates to ""...suddenly discovered that Carolyn Wilson of OHA had stolen their security deposits and fled the city.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: East Bay Community Law Center:** The passage mentions the center *hosted* a meeting, but doesn't say Carolyn Wilson worked there.
*   **B: Oakland Police:** The passage says the Oakland Police are investigating properties, not that Carolyn Wilson worked for them.
*   **D: Lockwood Gardens:** Lockwood Gardens is where the tenants live; Carolyn Wilson did not work *for* them.



"
Season ki chaar race bachi rahne par Drivers championship ke chauthe sthan par kaun hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Bowyer**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Teesare mein, hamlin bees ankonse peechhe hain, lekin bowyer se paanch ank age hain.""  This means Hamlin is third, and Bowyer is just behind him in fourth place.

Let's break it down:

*   Keselowski: 2,250 points (1st)
*   Johnson: 2,243 points (2nd)
*   Hamlin: 2,243 - 20 = 2,223 points (3rd)
*   Bowyer: 2,223 + 5 = 2,228 points (4th)"
Passage mein btayi gayi race ke anusaar Drivers ki Championship mein Kahne ko kitne points mile?,"The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The passage states: ""Kahne aur truex, junior kramshah 2,220 aur 2,207 ankon ke saath paanchven aur chhathe asthan par hain."" This directly tells us Kahne has 2,220 points."
Passage ke anusaar kitni baar logon ne ulkapindon ko girte hue dekha jo ki bad mein satyaapit hua ki ve mool roop se mangal se hain?,"The correct answer is **B: Paanch baar**.

The passage states: ""Yah itihas mein paanchvin baar maanaa gaya hai ki logonne dekhaa dharti par geerate hue yuddh samagri ke rasayanik roop se pushti ke gayee hain.""  This translates to: ""It has been confirmed five times in history that people have seen debris falling to Earth and it has been chemically confirmed to be from Mars.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly states it has been confirmed *five* times.
"
Jaisa ki passage mein bataya gaya hai patharon ke bare mein kya shi hai jo ki mool roop se mangal mein mile hain?,"The correct answer is **D: 34 hain** (There are 34 of them).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Prithvi par girne waale lagbhag 24,000 gyaat ulkapindon mein se kewal 34 ke baare mein satyaapit kiya gaya hai ki way mool roop se mangal se hain."" (Out of the approximately 24,000 known meteorites that have fallen on Earth, only 34 have been confirmed to be originally from Mars.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sabhi july mein hue ulkapat ke dauraan mile hain** (All were found during the July meteor shower) - The passage states *fifteen* of the Martian rocks were from a July meteor event, not all 34.
* **B: 24,000 hain** (There are 24,000) - This is the *total* number of meteorites found on Earth, not specifically Martian ones.
* **C: Lagbhad $11,000 se jyada ka sona** (More than $11,000 worth of gold) - The passage compares the price of these rocks *to* gold, it doesn't say they are worth more than $11,000 worth of gold. It says they are 10 times more expensive than gold *per ounce*.



"
Schumacher kab retire hue?,"Sahi jawab hai: **D: 2009 season ke aakhir mein**

Paasage mein saaf-saaf kaha gaya hai ki ""Schumacher ne saal 2006 mein is khel se sanyas le lia tha"". Lekin Felipe Massa ke ghayal hone ki wajah se unhe waapas aane ki zaroorat padi. Isliye, Schumacher ka sanyas 2006 mein hua tha, lekin wo 2009 season ke aakhir tak dobara khelne ke liye waapas aaye."
Massa kab ghayal hue?,"The correct answer is **A: Grand Prix ke dauraan** (During the Grand Prix).

The text explicitly states that Massa was injured ""during the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Formula 1 championship jeetne ke baad** - The text doesn't state Massa was injured *after* winning a championship.
*   **C: Schumacher ke retirement se pehle** - Schumacher retired in 2006, but Massa's injury was in 2009.
*   **D: 2009 season se pehle** - The injury happened *during* the 2009 season, specifically at the Hungarian Grand Prix.



"
Passage ke anusaar vyavastha AOL ko kaise prabhavit karegi?,"The correct answer is **C: AOL ke kul upayogkartaon ki sankhya eksath Yahoo aur Microsoft ke upayogkartaon ka saamna karegi** (AOL's total number of users will face Yahoo and Microsoft's users together).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yahoo! aur microsoft sevaaon ke upayogkartaon ke sankhya eksath aol ke grahakon ke sankhya ka saamana karegi."" This directly translates to ""The number of users of Yahoo! and Microsoft services will face the number of AOL's customers together.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: AOL ke upayogkartaon ke sankhya sambhavtah badhegi** (AOL's number of users will likely increase) - The passage suggests the opposite, a challenge to AOL's user base.
*   **B: AOL eklouti aise company hogi jo IM market viksit karegi** (AOL will be the only company to develop the IM market) - The passage mentions Yahoo! and Microsoft as competitors, disproving this.
*   **D: AOL ab america mein upyog nhi kiya jayega** (AOL will no longer be used in America) - The passage doesn't state AOL will become unusable, only that its dominance is threatened.



"
Inmein se kaun shayad nayi vyavastha ko khatam kar sakta hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Yahoo aur Microsoft ki bhaagidaari (Yahoo and Microsoft's partnership)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that if AOL continues operating at its own pace, its dominance won't last because Yahoo! and Microsoft will gain users and *rival* AOL's customer base.  This directly implies that a combined effort (partnership) from Yahoo and Microsoft is what could *end* AOL's current system/advantage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: America ke under internet ke apne vyaapak upayog (Widespread internet use in America):**  The passage states widespread use *allowed* AOL to grow, not that it would end the system.
* **B: IM market ka upayog (Use of the IM market):** While the IM market is relevant, the passage highlights the competition *within* that market, specifically from Yahoo and Microsoft.
* **C: AOL ke apni khud ke raftar se market ko age badhaane ki azaadi (AOL's freedom to develop the market at its own pace):** The passage suggests this freedom is *the problem* – it's unsustainable.  It's not something that would end the system, but rather the system is threatened *because* of it.



"
Hamale mein mare gye kitne log police adhikari nhi the?,"The correct answer is **C: 0**.

Here's why:

* The passage states two police officers were killed.
* It also states that 19 of the injured were police officers.
* This implies all the fatalities were police officers, meaning zero non-police officers died.

Therefore, the number of people killed who were *not* police officers is 0.



"
Kisne hamle ke liye kathit zimmedaar btaya?,"The correct answer is **A: Police**.

The text states: ""Police ne kahaa ki unhein hamale ke liye zimmedaar kathit Daesh (ISIL) ladaakon par sandeh hai."" which translates to ""Police said they suspect the alleged Daesh (ISIL) fighters responsible for the attack.""

Therefore, the police are the ones who identified the suspected perpetrators.



"
Florida mein sabhi rajya ke roop mein vijeta hone ki vajah se Mitt Romney ko sammaanit kiya?,"The correct answer is **C: Rajya ke sabhi pratinidhi** (All the state's representatives).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Florida ne apne sabhi pachas pratinidhiyon ko Romney ko sammaanit kiye..."" which directly translates to ""...Florida awarded all of its fifty representatives to Romney...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Rajya ke 32 pratinidhi** (State's 32 representatives) - The passage states 50 representatives, not 32.
* **B: Republican Party ke namankan** (Republican Party nomination) - While winning in Florida *helps* with the nomination, it's not what he was *awarded* for winning.
* **D: 46 pratishat vote** (46 percent vote) -  The percentage of votes he received explains *how* he won, not *what* he was awarded.



"
Passage ke anusaar praathamik chunaav mein Gingrich ko kitne pratishat vote mile?,"The correct answer is **B: 32 pratishat**.

The passage states: ""Newt Gingrich sadan ke poorv american vaktaa 32 pratishat ke saath dusre sthan par aye."" (Newt Gingrich, former Speaker of the American House, came in second with 32 percent of the vote.)"
Passage ke anusaar caucus ke parinaam ke bad kaun nhi ladai jaari nhi krega?,"The correct answer is **B: Bachmann**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""August mein aims straw poll ko jeetane vaali Bachmann ne apna campaign khatm karne ka faisla lia."" (Bachmann, who won the August aims straw poll, decided to end her campaign.)

This clearly indicates that Bachmann will not continue the fight after the caucus results.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gingrich:** The passage says Gingrich praised Santorum and criticized Romney *after* the results, implying he's continuing.
*   **C: Perry:** The passage says Perry initially considered re-evaluating but *then* stated he would stay in the race and compete in South Carolina.
*   **D: Romney:** Romney is criticized *by* Gingrich, but there's no indication he's dropping out.



"
Passage ke anusaar caucus ke parinaam ke bad kisne dusre pratyashi ki badayi ki?,"The correct answer is **B: Gingrich**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Natija aane ke baad Gingrich ne Santorum ki tarif ke, lekin Romney ke ninda ke..."" This directly translates to ""After the results came in, Gingrich praised Santorum, but condemned Romney...""

Therefore, Gingrich is the one who praised another candidate (Santorum) after the caucus results.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bachmann:** Bachmann ended her campaign.
*   **C: Romney:** Romney was *condemned* by Gingrich, not the one doing the praising.
*   **D: Perry:** Perry was evaluating his future in the race.



"
2015 ke pehle show sirf kis jagah dikhaya gya tha?,"The correct answer is **A: TogiNet Radio**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""iske shuruati dino mein, is show ko kewal lambe samay tak chalane vaali internet radio site toginet radio... par feature kiya gaya tha."" (In its early days, the show was only featured on the long-running internet radio site TogiNet Radio...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Purvi texas** - The show *included* actors from East Texas, but wasn't shown *in* East Texas.
*   **C: AstroNet Radio** - AstroNet Radio was established *later*, in late 2015, as a supporting station.
*   **D: Sthaniye radio station** - The show was on an *internet* radio station, not a local/traditional radio station.



"
Station ne show ko kis tarah ke ghumaav ke taur par dikhaya hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Avyavasthit**.

The passage states the station's website described the show as having a ""naye aur kharab tareekese avyavasthit ghumaav"" (new and bad way disorganized spin).  Therefore, ""avyavasthit"" (disorganized) is the way the station portrayed the show's spin.
"
David Headley ne aisa kya ektrit kiya jisse ki aatankvaadi samooh ko madad mili?,"The correct answer is **A: Jaankari (Information)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""David Headley ki scouting aur **suchna ektrikaran** se pakistani aatankvaadi samooh lashkar-e-taiyaba ke 10 bandukdhariyon ko operation ko safal banaane mein madad mili thi.""  This means David Headley gathered and provided information (suchna ektrikaran) that helped the terrorists.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Grenade:** The passage mentions grenades being *brought* by the attackers, but not collected by Headley.
* **C: Bandukdhari:** Headley didn't collect the gunmen; he aided them.
* **D: Swachaalit hathiyar:** Similar to grenades, the passage states the attackers brought the weapons, not Headley.



"
Aatankvaadi samooh ne Mumbai aane ke liye parivaah ke kis saadhan ka istemal kiya?,"The correct answer is **C: Naav** (Boat).

The passage clearly states: ""26 november 2008 ko mumbai ke hamlawar **naav** ke dwara pahunche..."" (On November 26, 2008, the attackers reached Mumbai **by boat**...).

Therefore, the terrorists used a boat to travel to Mumbai."
Kaun sa kathan passage mein diya gye Nadal aur Raonic’s Brisbane Open match ke natije ko sahi se darshata hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Raonic ne Nadal ko haraya** (Raonic defeated Nadal).

The passage states: ""Way hall hi mein brisbane open mein Raonic ke khilaf haar gaye the."" which translates to ""Nadal lost to Raonic in the Brisbane Open.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Raonic ko net 88% point mile** - The passage says Nadal received 88% net points on his *first serve*, not Raonic.
* **C: Nadal ne Raonic ko haraya** - This is the opposite of what the passage states.
* **D: Raonic ne 76 points haasil kiye** - The passage states Nadal won 76 points with his first serve, not Raonic.



"
Passage ke anusaar first serve ke bad Nadal aur Raonic ke match ke kya natija rha?,"The correct answer is **D: Raonic ne Nadal ko haraya** (Raonic defeated Nadal).

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Way hall hi mein brisbane open mein Raonic ke khilaf haar gaye the."" This directly translates to ""In the way hall, he lost to Raonic in the Brisbane Open.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Raonic ko net 88% point mile** (Raonic got 88% net points) - This refers to Nadal's first serve performance, not the overall match result.
*   **B: Nadal ne 76 point jeete** (Nadal won 76 points) - While the passage mentions 76 winning points for Nadal's first serve, it doesn't state he won 76 *points* in the match against Raonic.
*   **C: Score 7-2 rha** (The score was 7-2) - This refers to Nadal's overall record *against* Canadians, not the specific match against Raonic.



"
Teen naye Naked News broadcasts mein kaun si bhasha ka program shaamil nhi hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Japani**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Naked News *already* reports in Japanese and English. It is *adding* Spanish, Italian, and Korean. Therefore, Japanese is not one of the *new* languages being added.

"
Passage ke anusaar naya Naked News broadcasts kahan uplabdh nhi hoga?,"The correct answer is **C: Theater**.

Here's why:

The passage states Naked News will be broadcasting in new languages on **television, web, and mobile devices**.  It doesn't mention anything about theaters. Therefore, the new broadcasts will *not* be available in theaters.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mobile:** The passage explicitly states broadcasts will be available on mobile devices.
* **B: Internet:** The passage explicitly states broadcasts will be available on the web (internet).
* **D: Television:** The passage explicitly states broadcasts will be available on television.



"
Kitne pratiyogiyon ne vishal slallum ko pura nhi kiya?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""giant slallum mein kul 117 mein se 45 skier is race mein asthan paane mein asafal rahe."" This directly translates to ""45 skiers failed to finish the giant slalom out of a total of 117.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 36** - This refers to the number of skiers who didn't finish the first slalom, not the giant slalom.
*   **B: 117** - This is the total number of skiers in the giant slalom, not the number who didn't finish.
*   **C: 4** - This refers to the number of skiers who didn't finish in the current group of women's giant slalom, not the total who didn't finish."
Kaun sa kathan Championship ki daud ke parinaam ko sahi se darshata hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Vishal slallum mein 45 skiers ne apni daud samaapt nhi ki**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states directly:** ""giant slalom mein kul 117 mein se 45 skier is race mein asthan paane mein asafal rahe"" (In the giant slalom, 45 out of 117 skiers failed to finish the race).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Doosri daud mein Hungary ke skier se pehle Carpenado ne daud samaapt ki** - The passage states Carpenado finished *slower* than the Hungarian skier, not faster.
* **C: Zyadatar skier ne slallum ki tulna mein vishal slallum samaapt ki** -  We don't have enough information to compare the completion rates between the two races. We only know 36 skiers didn't finish the slalom and 45 didn't finish the giant slalom.
* **D: Carpenado ne slallum dasavein sthan mein samaapt ki** - The passage says Carpenado *did not complete* the first run of the slalom.



"
NBA ne niman mein se kise sthagit karne ka faisla kiya?,"The correct answer is **A: Basketball season**.

Here's why:

The text clearly states: ""Covid-19 se judee chinta ke vajah budhwar ko united states national basketball association (nba) ne apna **professional basketball season** sthagit kar diya hai."" (Due to concerns related to Covid-19, the United States National Basketball Association (NBA) suspended its **professional basketball season** on Wednesday.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Utah Jazz se khiladi:** The text says a Utah Jazz player *tested positive*, but the NBA didn't suspend the *player*, they suspended the season.
*   **C: Koi bhi khiladi jiska COVID-19 positive paya gaya:**  Again, the suspension was of the season, not individual players.
*   **D: Utah Jazz basketball team:** The team wasn't suspended, the season was.



"
Passage ke anusaar virus ki vajah se NBA ko kis chiz ki chinta hui?,"The correct answer is **A: NBA ke sadasya ka test positive raha** (An NBA member tested positive).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Covid-19 se judee chinta ke vajah... NBA ne apna professional basketball season sthagit kar diya hai... Nba ke faisale ke baad ek utah jazz khiladi covid-19 postive paya gaya."" (Due to concerns related to Covid-19... the NBA suspended its professional basketball season... After the NBA's decision, a Utah Jazz player tested positive for Covid-19.)

This directly indicates the concern was *because* a member (a Utah Jazz player) tested positive.  The NBA suspended the season *after* learning of the positive test, showing that's what triggered the worry.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Utah Jazz ke game mein kayi khiladiyon ka test positive paya gaya** (Multiple players on the Utah Jazz tested positive) - The passage only mentions *one* player.
* **C: Utah Jazz ke khiladi ka test positive aane ke bad unhone kharab pardarshan kiya** (After the Utah Jazz player tested positive, they performed poorly) -  The passage doesn't mention anything about performance.
* **D: Utah Jazz ke khiladi test positive aya** (A Utah Jazz player tested positive) - While true, this is a *result* of the concern, not the *concern itself*.  The concern *was* about the virus and its potential spread, evidenced by a positive test.



"
Washington Capitals ke liye Atlanta Thrashers ke virudh kisne khek jeetane wala goal kiya?,"The correct answer is **A: Nicklas Backstrom**.

The passage states: ""us raat rookie Nicklas Backstrom ke khel jitaane waale goal se ovechkin ko sabse pahali madad milli."" which translates to ""that night, Ovechkin got the first assist on rookie Nicklas Backstrom's game-winning goal."""
Capitals banam Thrashers game ke dauran kisne season ka 60van goal scor kiya?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Raat ka unka doosra goal season ka unka 60van goal tha..."" which translates to ""His second goal of the night was his 60th goal of the season...""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Mario Lemieux** and **Jaromir Jagr** are mentioned as players who scored 60+ goals *before* Ovechkin, not *during* the Capitals vs. Thrashers game.
*   **Nicklas Backstrom** scored the game-winning goal but didn't score the 60th goal of the season.



"
Northern rock bank ko kab sarkar ke madad sahaayata thi?,"The correct answer is **D: Mortgage sankat ke dauran (During the mortgage crisis)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""2007 mein subprime mortgage sankat ke dauran northern rock ko iske exposure ke karan samarthan ki zaroorat thi."" (During the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis, Northern Rock needed support due to its exposure.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bank ke rashtriyakaran hone ke bad (After the bank was nationalized):** The support came *before* nationalization, leading *to* nationalization.
*   **B: Bank ke sampatti prabandhan karne waali company se alag hone par (When the bank's asset management company was separated):** This happened *after* the initial support and nationalization.
*   **C: Virgin samoh ke bank kharide jane ke bad (After the Virgin Group bought the bank):** Virgin didn't buy the original Northern Rock bank; they bought the ""good bank"" *after* it was separated.



"
Passage ke anusaar Northern Rock bank ke saath Virgin samoh ki dealings ko kaun sa kathan sabse shi se darshata hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Virgin Group ne mortgage sankat ke dauran bank ko aapaatkaleen sahaayata ki peshkash ki.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Sir richard branson ke virgin samooh ne un bankon ke liye boli lagaai thi jinhe rashtriyakaranse pehle aswikar kar diya gaya tha."" This directly translates to Virgin Group offering to help/bid for the bank *during* the subprime mortgage crisis, before it was nationalized.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage explicitly states ""Virgin ne kewal uttari rok ke 'achcha bank' ko kharida hai, naa ki sampatti prabandhan karne waali company ko."" (Virgin only bought the 'good bank' of Northern Rock, not the asset management company).
* **B:** Virgin bid *before* the nationalization, not after.
* **D:** The passage says they bid *before* nationalization, making this incorrect.



"
Passage ke anusaar Kyoto jalavaayu samjhaute par hastakshar karne se kis desh ko farq pada hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sanyukt rajya america (United States of America)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kyoto jalavaayu samjhaute par hastakshar karne ke shree rudd ke nirnay ne **sanyukt rajya america** ko alag kar diya hai, jo ab ekmatra viksit rashtra hoga jisane samjhaute ke pushti nahin ke hai."" (The decision to sign the Kyoto climate agreement has isolated the **United States of America**, which will now be the only developed nation not to have ratified the agreement.)

The passage also mentions Australia, India, and China, but in the context of *why* Australia didn't ratify the agreement - it wasn't about the impact *on* those countries, but about their lack of emission targets."
Australia ke poorv sarkar sochti hai ki Kyoto ke pushti karne se kise nuksan hoga?,"The correct answer is **C: Koyale ke niryaat**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Australia ke poorv roodhivaadi sarkarne kyoto ke pushti karne se mana karte hue kahaa ki jabki bharat aur china jaise desh utsarjan lakshyase nahin bandhe hain, isse **koyale ke niryaat par bhari nirbharta ke saath arthavyavastha ko nuksan hoga**.""

This directly translates to: ""Australia's previous conservative government refused to ratify Kyoto, saying that while countries like India and China are not bound by emissions targets, this would harm the economy with its heavy reliance on coal exports.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sanyukt rajya america:** The passage mentions the US not ratifying the agreement, but the question asks what *Australia's* government thought would be harmed.
*   **B: Desh ki arthavyavastha:** While the economy *would* be harmed, the specific source of the harm (coal exports) is more directly stated.
*   **D: Desh ke utsarjan lakshya:** Australia didn't believe they should be bound by emissions targets, but they are concerned about the impact on their *exports* specifically.



"
Kis program ke tahat nishaanebaajon ki bharti ki gyi thi?,"The correct answer is **D: Sporting shooters association ke hunting program**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...*Npws aur australia ke sporting shooters association (nsw) ke beech saajhedaari mein talent hunting show ke tahat kabil swayamsevakon ke bharti ke gayee thi.*"" This directly translates to ""capable volunteers were recruited under a talent hunting show in partnership between NPWS and the Australia Sporting Shooters Association (NSW).""  This implies the recruitment was part of a hunting program run *by* the Sporting Shooters Association.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Australia ke sporting shooters association program:** While involved, it's a *talent hunting show* within the SSA's broader activities, not a standalone program.
*   **B: Udyaan sanrakshan aur viraasat program:** This is the department Mick O'Flynn leads, but not the program under which the shooters were recruited.
*   **C: NPWS program:** NPWS partnered, but didn't run the recruitment program itself.



"
Inmein se kaun sa kathan keat niyantran pareekshan ko sahi se darshata hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Nishaanebaajon ke rangers dwara bariki se nigrani ke jaani thi.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""use tarah poorak keat niyantran pareekshan mein nishanebazon ke rangers dwara bariki se nigrani ke jaani thi."" (In the same way, the supplementary pest control trial was to be closely monitored by the rangers with the shooters.) This directly describes the pest control trial.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kyunki yah program ka pehla pareeksahn hai iska mulyankan nhi kiya gaya tha** - The passage states the trial *was* evaluated after initial monitoring.
* **B: Nishaanebaajon ko prashikshan se judey nirdesh mile** - While true, this is a detail *about* the shooters, not a description of the trial itself.
* **D: Chaar nishaanebaajon ko chuna gaya** -  Again, this is a detail *about* the process, not a description of the trial.



"
Passage ke anusaar vibhajan kahan mila?,"The correct answer is **A: Rift valley mein**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""...*ethopia mein rift valley research service ke shodhkarta aur adhyayan ke saha-lekhak, barhen asfaune kahaa.*"" This directly indicates the split (vibhajan) was found in the Rift Valley.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jeevashmon par** - The passage mentions fossils (*Jeevashmon*) are used to *date* the split, but the split itself wasn't *found on* the fossils.
*   **C: Aanvik sakshya mein** - The passage contrasts the dating from fossils with dating from molecular evidence (*Aanvik sakshya*). It doesn't say the split was found *in* molecular evidence.
*   **D: Ethiopia mein** - While the research service is *in* Ethiopia, the specific location of the find is the Rift Valley *within* Ethiopia.



"
Passage ke anusaar kya umeed se pehle hua?,"The correct answer is **B: Vibhajan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jeevashmon ke aadhar par, iska matlab hai ki vibhajan aanvik sakshya dwara pratyaashit hone ke tulna mein bahut purana hai.""  This translates to: ""Based on fossils, it means the split (vibhajan) is much older than predicted by molecular evidence.""

This directly indicates that the *split* or *division* happened *earlier than expected* based on genetic analysis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jeevashmon ki khoj (Discovery of fossils):** The passage talks about fossils *leading to* the conclusion, not the discovery itself being unexpected.
*   **C: Aanvik sakshya ke vishleshan (Analysis of molecular evidence):**  The molecular evidence is what the passage says the split is *older than*, not something that happened unexpectedly.
*   **D: Rift valley mein research (Research in the Rift Valley):** The Rift Valley research is where the discoverer is from, but isn't what the passage claims happened sooner than expected.



"
Video game ke dauran khilaaniyon ke movement control karne ke liye khilaaniyon ko kya karna hoga?,"Sahi jawab hai **D: Hawa se controller ko move karein**.

P mein saaf-saaf likha hai ki ""yah device ko hawa mein move karke khilaaniyon ko action aur movement control karne ki anumati dega."" Isliye, khilaariyon ko video game ke dauran movement control karne ke liye controller ko hawa mein move karna hoga.

अन्य विकल्प सही क्यों नहीं हैं:

* **A:** Controller ke sensor ko console ke paas rakhna device ko kaam karne ke liye zaroori hai, lekin gameplay control karne ka tarika nahi hai.
* **B:** ""Isthiti ko tribhujaakar banana"" controller ki technology ka varnan hai, gameplay ka nahi.
* **C:** Sensor ko television ke paas rakhna bhi device ko kaam karne ke liye zaroori hai, lekin gameplay control karne ka tarika nahi hai."
Television remote se milta-julta dikhne wala kya design kiya gaya tha?,"The correct answer is **B: Nintendo Revolution controller**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Television remote se milta-julta, controller..."" (Similar to a television remote, the controller...). The question asks what design *looked* like a television remote. Therefore, the answer is the controller itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Controller ke do sensor:** The sensors are *part* of the controller, but they aren't the design that resembles a remote.
*   **C: Aham presentation:** This refers to the event, not a design.
*   **D: Nintendo Revolution console:** This is the console the controller is *for*, not the design itself."
Samachar agency shinhuane ki taza report mein kya nahi bataya gya?,"The correct answer is **A: Vimaan ko bum se udane ki dhamki di gayi** (The plane was threatened to be blown up).

Here's why:

The passage states that *later* reports mentioned the bomb threat. The initial report from Xinhua only mentioned the hijacking. Therefore, the initial report *did not* include information about the bomb threat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Vimaan urumki mein utara gya tha** - The passage states the plane was *intended* to land in Urumqi, but then taken to Afghanistan.
*   **C: Vimaan ko Afghanistan ke taraf moda gya tha** - The passage explicitly states the plane was diverted towards Afghanistan.
*   **D: Vimaan ko Kandahar mein utara gya tha** - The passage states the plane was landed in Kandahar.



"
Samachar agency shinhuane ki pichli report mein kya nahi bataya gya?,"The correct answer is **D: Vimaan ko bum se udane ki dhamki di gayi.**

Here's why:

The passage states that *later* reports revealed the plane had received information about a bomb threat and was diverted to Kandahar. The *initial* report from Xinhua only mentioned the hijacking. Therefore, the bomb threat information was *not* in the initial report.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vimaan ke apaharan ho gya tha** - The initial report *did* state the plane was hijacked.
*   **B: Vimaan ko apatkalin landing se incar kar diya gya tha** - The passage says the emergency landing was *intended* for Urumqi, but doesn't state it was successfully carried out in the initial report.
*   **C: Vimaan ko Afghanistan vaapas le jaya gaya tha** - This is information that came *after* the initial report, not something missing from it.



"
Radio karyakaram ke dauran Saara Danius ne kya ghoshna ki thi?,"The correct answer is **D: Samito Bob Dylan tak pahuchne ke prayason ko chhod degi** (The committee will abandon efforts to reach Bob Dylan).

Here's why:

The passage states that Saara Danius announced the committee had *given up* trying to contact Bob Dylan directly regarding the 2016 Nobel Prize. This is directly reflected in option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Saahitya ke liye nobel purushkar ke vijeta** (The winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature) - The announcement wasn't *who* the winner was, but about the difficulty in contacting the winner.
* **B: Samiti ko sahyogiyo se koi jawab nhi mila** (The committee received no response from collaborators) - While the passage mentions responses were *friendly*, it doesn't say they received *no* response.
* **C: Saahitya mein nobel purushkar ke 2016 ke namankan** (The 2016 nomination for the Nobel Prize in Literature) - The passage isn't about the nomination process, but about the attempts to contact the winner *after* the prize was awarded.



"
Kaun nhi pahuch paya?,"The correct answer is **B: Saaraa Danius**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""saaraa danius, sweeden samiti mein saveridge radio par ek radio karyakram ke dauran saarvajanik roop se ghoshana ke, ki saahitya mein 2016 ke nobel puraskar jeetane ko lekar **seedhe bob dylan tak pahunchane mein asamarth** hocker, apne prayason ko chhod chuke the.""

This directly translates to: Saaraa Danius announced that she was unable to reach Bob Dylan directly regarding the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature, and had given up trying.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bob Dylan ke nazdiki sahyogi (Bob Dylan's close associates):** The passage states Danius emailed *her colleagues*, not Dylan's.
*   **C: Sweeden samiti (Sweden Committee):** The passage focuses on Danius's inability to reach Dylan, not the committee as a whole.
*   **D: Bob Dylan:** The passage says Danius couldn't *reach* Bob Dylan, not that Bob Dylan couldn't be reached by anyone.



"
Pratigya ko kisne “ek mahatvapurn kadam” btaya?,"The correct answer is **B: George W. Bush**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bushes pravakta garden jondrone uttari koria ke pratigya ko """"koriyai praaydweep ke satyaapit kiye jaa sakane vaale denuclearisation ko paane ke disha mein ek mahatvapurn kadam"""" bataaya."" 

This translates to: ""Bush's spokesperson, Garden Jondrone, called North Korea's pledge """"a significant step towards achieving the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."""" ""

While Garden Jondrone *said* it, he was speaking *for* Bush. The statement originated from Bush's office/perspective. Therefore, Bush is the one who considered the pledge a significant step.



"
Slania ne kayi deshon ke liye kitne stamps banaye?,"The correct answer is **D: 1,000 se jyada** (more than 1,000).

The text states: ""Unhone sweeden aur 28 dusre deshon ke liye 1,000se yaada stamp banaae."" which translates to ""He created more than 1,000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 2,000 se jyada** - The text doesn't specify *more* than 2,000, only *more* than 1,000.
*   **B: 1000** -  The text specifically says *more than* 1,000.
*   **C: Kareeb 2,000** - The text doesn't give an approximate number of 2,000.



"
Passage ke anusaar tankiyon ke chhidra se lagataar leakage ki kya vajah hai?,"सही उत्तर है **C: Thermal expansion**.

Passage में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि ""बुधवार की दोपहर तक टैंक के नीचे थर्मल विस्तार से रिसाव जारी रहा।"" यह बताता है कि टैंक से लगातार रिसाव की वजह थर्मल विस्तार है।

अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि:

*   **A:** दूसरा containment क्षेत्र भरने की क्षमता के बारे में जानकारी रिसाव के कारण के बारे में नहीं बताती है।
*   **B:** नियमित fire-command system परीक्षण रिसाव का कारण था, लेकिन लगातार रिसाव का नहीं।
*   **D:** Fort Greely के पंप स्टेशन में आग लगने का कोई उल्लेख नहीं है।"
Reliyef valves kyu khula rha?,"Correct answer is **B: System pareekshan ke bad power failure hua tha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ek niyamit fire-command system pareekshan ke chalte bijli chale jaanese reliyef valve khula gaye..."" This directly translates to ""relief valves opened due to a power failure during a routine fire-command system test.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tank ke ander thermal expansion tha:** Thermal expansion is mentioned as a *result* of the leak, not the *cause* of the valves opening.
*   **C: Tankiyon ki poorna kshamata thi:** The passage states the tank was *not* filled to capacity, making this incorrect.
*   **D: Doosra containment area abhi tak zyada barrel nhi rakh sakta:** The passage says the second containment area *could* hold more barrels, so this is false.



"
Vartamaan mein nauvaan ward mein paani kitna oopar hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Kamar se oopar**.

The passage specifically states: ""Nauvaan ward, jo toofan catarina ke dauran 20 feet tak oonchaa dekhaa gaya tha, wah vartamaan mein kamar se oopar paani mein hai..."" (Ninth Ward, which was seen up to 20 feet high during Hurricane Katrina, is currently in waist-deep water...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 20 feet:** While the water *was* 20 feet high during Katrina, the passage states the current level is different.
* **B: 6 inch:** The passage mentions 6 inches of rain *could* damage levees, but doesn't state that's the current water level in the Ninth Ward.
* **D: 100 feet:** This refers to the *width* of the breach in the levee, not the water level.



"
"Toofan catarina ke dauran, Nauve ward me kya hua?","The correct answer is **B: Kamar se oopar paani tha** (Water was waist-deep).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nauvaan ward, jo toofan catarina ke dauran 20 feet tak oonchaa dekhaa gaya tha, wah vartamaan mein kamar se oopar paani mein hai...""  This directly translates to ""Ninth ward, which was seen up to 20 feet high during Hurricane Katrina, is currently waist-deep in water...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pani 100 ki chaudain me fail gya** (Water spread in a width of 100 feet) - While the passage mentions a 100-foot breach, this isn't *what happened* during Katrina, it's a current situation.
*   **C: Baadh ka pani 20 feet tak oonchaa dekhaa gaya** (Flood water was seen up to 20 feet high) - This refers to the height *during* Katrina, not the current state of the Ninth Ward.
*   **D: 6 inch barish ne kshatigrast baandhon ko tod dia** (6 inches of rain broke damaged dams) - This is about a potential future event, not what happened in the Ninth Ward during or after Katrina.



"
Inme se kis kathan ki pushti Hamilton ne nhi ki?,"The correct answer is **A: Mareez ke kahi jane ki** (That the patient had traveled).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hamilton ne pushti ke ki Harvard university aspatal ne mareez ko asthir haalat mein bharti kiya. **mareez Nigeria gaya tha**, jahaan ebola virus ke kuch mamle samne aye hain."" (Hamilton confirmed that Harvard University Hospital admitted a patient in unstable condition. **The patient had gone to Nigeria**, where some cases of Ebola virus have been reported.)
* **However**, the question asks which statement Hamilton *did not* confirm.  While the passage *states* the patient went to Nigeria, it's attributed to the information being provided *about* the patient, not something Hamilton specifically confirmed himself. Hamilton confirmed the hospital admission and the unstable condition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sambhaavit sankraman ke khatre ki** (The potential risk of infection) - The passage clearly indicates this by mentioning the Ebola virus and the need for infection control.
* **C: Niyamon ka paalan kiye jane ki** (That the rules were followed) - The passage states the hospital followed infection control rules.
* **D: Mareez ki maujooda sthiti ki** (The patient's current condition) - Hamilton confirmed the patient was admitted in an unstable condition.



"
Vaigyaanik kya samajhna chahte hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Prithvi kaise bany** (How Earth was formed).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vaigyaanikon ko yah samajhne ki ummid hai ki grah kaise bante hain, khas kar prithvi kaise bany..."" (Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, *especially how Earth was formed*...).  The entire premise of studying the comet's potential water delivery is *to understand Earth's formation*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dhumketu prithvi se kab takraye** (When comets collided with Earth) - While the passage mentions collisions, the primary goal isn't *when* they happened, but what they *contributed* to Earth.
*   **B: Protiens kaise bany** (How proteins were formed) - The passage doesn't mention proteins at all.
*   **C: Organic tatva kya hain** (What organic elements are) - While comets *contain* organic molecules, the passage isn't focused on defining what those elements are, but on their role in delivering water.

"Passage ke hisab se, chhanbin band karne me local police ki kya bhumika thi?","The correct answer is **C: Unhone motor chalakon ko dusre raastese par bhej dia**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Surang ke pravesh ko band karne ke liye dump trucks ka istemal kiya gaya tha aur motor chalakon ko dusre raastese bhejane ke liye 80 police karmiyon ke sahaayata liye gayee.""  This directly translates to ""Dump trucks were used to block the tunnel entrance, and 80 police officers were used to redirect drivers to alternative routes.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Unhone fbi ke kahane par chhanbin band ki:** The passage states the *Maryland Transportation Authority* stopped the investigation based on the FBI's statement, not the police.
* **B: Unhone khud ise band karne ka nirnay lia:** The passage doesn't say the police *decided* to close it, only that they *helped* with the closure.
* **D: Unhone vaikalpik marg ke sath-sath yatayat ke rukawat ke suchna di:** The passage specifically states there was *no* information given about traffic disruptions on alternative routes.



"
chhanbin band karne par surang ke pravesh ka kya hua?,"The correct answer is **A: Surang ke pravesh ko band kar dia gya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Surang ke pravesh ko band karne ke liye dump trucks ka istemal kiya gaya tha..."" (Dump trucks were used to block the tunnel entrance...).  This directly answers the question of what happened to the tunnel entrance when the investigation was halted.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Unhe dusre raastese bhejane ke liye istemal kiya gya (They were used to send them on another route):** This refers to *motor chalakon* (drivers), not the tunnel entrance itself.
*   **C: Unhe motor chalakon ke liye khol diya gya (They were opened for drivers):**  This is the opposite of what happened.
*   **D: Wha bhut jyada yatayat ke rukawat khadi ho gyi (There was a lot of traffic congestion there):** While there *could* have been congestion, the passage doesn't specifically state that it happened *at the tunnel entrance*. It says alternative routes had no reported blockage."
"Passage ke hisab se, photographer ko vaahan se takkar lagne se pahle kaun si ghatna nhi hui thi?","The correct answer is **D: Photographer bieber ki photo lena chahta tha.**

Here's why:

The passage states the photographer was trying to take photos of a police stop, but it *doesn't* mention anything about them trying to photograph Bieber.  The passage only says Bieber released a statement about the incident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Highway petrol pulis adhikari ne photographer se sadak paar karne ko kha:** The passage states the officer ordered him to stop twice.
* **B: Photographer ne apna vaahan sepulweda boulevard ke doosri taraf roka tha:**  The passage specifically states this happened.
* **C: Photographer ne pulis stop ke photo lee:** The passage states he *tried* to take photos of the police stop.



"
Photographer ko vaahan se takkar lagne se pahle wah kya karna chahta tha?,"The correct answer is **B: Pulis stop ke photo lena chahta tha** (He wanted to take photos of the police stop).

The text states: ""TMZ ka maanana hai ki photographer ne apna vaahan sepulweda boulevard ke doosri taraf roka tha aur **sadak paar karne aur jaari rakhane se pehle pulis stop ke photo lene ke koshish ke.**"" This directly translates to ""TMZ believes the photographer stopped his vehicle on the other side of Sepulveda Boulevard and **tried to take photos of the police stop before crossing the road and continuing.**""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sepulweda boulevard par apni gaadi khadi karna chahta tha** - He *did* stop his car, but that wasn't his *goal* before being hit.
* **C: Sadak paar karna chahta tha** - He intended to cross the road *after* taking the photos.
* **D: Pulis adhikari se photo lene ki anumati lena chahta tha** - The text doesn't mention anything about asking for permission. He was attempting to take the photos directly.



"
Kaun sa kathan rashtrapati ke virus se sankramit hone ki sthiti ka sateek varnan nhi karta hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Ve accha mahsoos nhi kr rhe**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""bukhaar aur gale mein kharash ke alawa, mein acchi tarah se aur acchi haalat mein mahsoos karta hoon..."" (Apart from fever and sore throat, I feel good and in good condition...).  This directly contradicts the statement that they are *not* feeling well.

Let's look at why the other options are correct descriptions:

* **B: Unke gale mein kharash hai** - The text says ""gale mein kharash"" (sore throat).
* **C: Unki haalat stir hai** - The text says ""Rashtrapati ke haalat stir hai"" (The President's condition is stable).
* **D: Unhe bukhaar hai** - The text says ""bukhaar"" (fever).

Therefore, option A is the *incorrect* statement about the President's condition.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, rashtrapati ke baare mein nimnalikhit mein se kaun sa kathan saty hai?","The correct answer is **B: Wah kayee dino tak ghar par ekant mein rahenge.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Rashtrapati ke haalat stir hai, haalaanki wah kayee dino tak ghar par ekant mein rahenge."" (The President's condition is stable, although he will remain isolated at home for several days.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Unhe bukhaar nhi hai** - The passage explicitly mentions ""bukhaar"" (fever) as a symptom.
* **C: Wah telecommuting karke apna kam pura kar sakte hai** - While he *intends* to, the passage doesn't confirm he *can* currently. He says he *hopes* to resume duties on Monday.
* **D: Wah virus se kayi baar sankramit ho chuke hai** - The passage states he was ""halke prakarse sankramit paaye gaye"" (found to be lightly infected), implying this is his first infection.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, tropical cyclone gonu ke kab kamzor rahne ke apeksha thi?","The correct answer is **B: Havaayen lagbhag 83 kimmy/ghanta thi**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Din ke shuruat mein, havaayen lagbhag 83 kimmy/ghanta thi aur iske kamzor rahne ke apeksha thi."" (In the beginning of the day, the winds were about 83 km/h and it was expected to weaken.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maldive pahunchne se pahle:** The passage doesn't mention expectations of weakening *before* reaching the Maldives.
*   **C: Apne charm par pahunchne se pahle:** The passage states it *reached* 240 km/h at its peak (charm par), not that it was expected to weaken before that.
*   **D: Havaaon ki gati 149 meal prati ghante pahunchne se pahle:** The passage doesn't talk about expectation of weakening before winds reached 149 mph.



"
Tropical cyclone gonu ke dauran havaayon ki charm par gati kitni thi?,"The correct answer is **A: 149 kilometer prati ghante**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Apne charm par, tropical cyclone gonu... 240 kilometres (149 meal prati ghante) ke lagaatar havaaon tak pahunch gaya.""  This means at its peak, the winds reached 240 kilometers *or* 149 miles per hour. The question asks for the speed *at its peak* (charm par), and 149 is given as the equivalent in miles per hour.

It's a bit confusing with the mix of units (km and meal - which should be mph), but the question is looking for the speed at peak intensity.  149 km/h is implied as the peak speed when converted to mph.

Therefore, the answer is A.



"
Nimnalikhit mein se kise karenia bravis ke lakshan nhi maana jaata hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Yah Bahu-koshika wala jeev hai** (It is a multicellular organism).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Laal jwaar, karenia bravis ke samanya sandratase zyada hone ke karan hota hai, jo praakritik roop se paaye jaane wala **ekal-koshika wala** samudri jeev hai.""  (Red tide is caused by an increase in the concentration of *Karenia brevis*, a **single-celled** marine organism found naturally.)

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

* **A: Yah ekal-koshika wala samudri jeev hai** (It is a single-celled marine organism) - This is *directly* stated in the passage.
* **B: Yah manushya ki nason ko kamzor kar sakta hai** (It can weaken human nerves) - The passage states it produces a neurotoxin that weakens nerves in both humans and fish.
* **D: Iska nirmaan praakritik roop se hota hai** (It occurs naturally) - The passage states it is found ""naturally.""

Therefore, the only statement that *contradicts* the information in the passage is that *Karenia brevis* is multicellular."
Karenia bravis inme se kya nhi kar sakta?,"The correct answer is **B: Kisi bhi parasthiti me iski sankhya naatakiya roop se badhti hai** (It drastically increases in number in any situation).

Here's why:

The passage states that *Karenia brevis* experiences dramatic increases in population when **natural factors create ideal conditions**.  This means it *doesn't* increase drastically in *any* situation - it needs specific favorable conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Machhali ke nason ko kamzor kar sakta hai** (Can weaken fish nerves) - The passage explicitly states it produces a neurotoxin that affects nerves in both humans and fish.
*   **C: Jal ko prabhaavit karta hai** (Affects water) - The passage clearly states the water becomes affected.
*   **D: Neurotoxin banaata hai** (Produces a neurotoxin) - The passage directly says it *creates* a neurotoxin.

Therefore, the only statement that *Karenia brevis* **cannot** do is increase drastically in number regardless of conditions."
"Passage ke hisab se, Felicia toofan aane par kya nhi hota hai?","The correct answer is **D: Baadh aa jati hai**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...haalanki abhi tak kshati yaa baadh ke Aisi koi suchna nahin mili hai."" This translates to ""...although so far there is no information about damage or flooding.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Laabhkari varsha hoti hai** - The passage says ""Ohu par ek gaze par 6.34 inch tak pahunchane waali namee ko laabhkari """"bataaya gaya."""" (The rainfall reaching up to 6.34 inches on Oahu was described as ""beneficial."")
*   **B: Musladhar barish hoti hai** - The passage states ""iske avasheshonse adhikatar dweepon mein musladhar barish hui"" (""most of the islands received heavy rainfall from its remnants."")
*   **C: Baar-baar bijli girti hai** - The passage states ""kuch varsha ke samay aandhi aai aur baar-baar bijli giri"" (""for some time there was a storm and frequent lightning."")

Therefore, the passage explicitly mentions that there has been *no information* about flooding."
Felicia toofan ke bare me kaun sa kathna galat hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Shreni 4 ke toofan me badlne se pahle ise ushnakatibandhiya avasaad kha gya**.

Here's why:

The passage states the storm *formed* from a tropical depression, and *then* became a Category 4 storm. It didn't get ""consumed"" by the depression.  It originated *from* it.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Ohu ke liye laabhkari barish hui** - The passage explicitly states the rain on Oahu was ""beneficial.""
*   **C: Adhikatar dweepon mein musladhar barish hui** - The passage says ""most islands received heavy rain.""
*   **D: Varsha ke samay bijli bhi giri** - The passage mentions ""frequent lightning"" during the storm.



"
Kaun sa kathan 2009 hangri gran pri ke parinaam ko sateek roop se darshaata hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Picket junior ko hangri grand pri ke baad nikal diya gaya**.

The text explicitly states: ""Picket junior ko 2009 hangri grand pri ke baad nikal diya gaya tha.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fernando Alonso durghatnagrast ho gaya** - Alonso crashed in the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, not the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.
*   **B: Picket junior ns jeet darj ki** - The text says Piquet Jr. *moved up* to a winning position *after* Alonso's pit stop in 2008, but doesn't mention him winning the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.
*   **D: Safety kar se durghatna hui** - The text says the safety car came out *because* of Alonso's crash, not that the safety car *caused* the crash."
Durghatna kab hui?,"The correct answer is **A: Alonso ke stop ke baad** (After Alonso's stop).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Piquet Jr. crashed *after* Alonso made his early pit stop.  The other options are either related to events surrounding the crash but don't pinpoint *when* it happened, or refer to a different person (Piquet)."
"Passage ke hisab se, nimnalikhit mein se kisane shodhkartaon ke mool anumaan se kam samay liya?","Correct answer is **A: Prajaati ke nirmaan me**.

Here's why:

The passage states that researchers previously believed species formation (especially between the *Geospiza fortes* and *Geospiza conerostris* finches) would take a long time. However, the new study shows a new species formed in just two generations. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Prajaati ki suchna dene me:** The passage is about the *formation* of a species, not just its discovery/notification.
*   **C: Alag-alag prajaati ke bich prajanan me:** The passage mentions interbreeding *as* the process previously thought to take a long time, but the question is about what took less time according to the study.
*   **D: Prajaatiyon ke vikas me:** While species formation is a part of evolution, the specific focus of the passage is the *speed* of the formation itself, not overall evolution.



"
Shodhkartaon ne kya nhi bataaya?,"Correct answer is **C: Nai prajaati ka naam**.

Here's why:

The passage states the study *suggests* the formation of a new bird species, but it **doesn't mention the name** of that new species. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nai prajaati ka nirmaan kha hua** - The passage mentions the location (Galapagos Islands).
*   **B: Viksit hone ka samay** - The passage *specifically* states the species developed in just two generations.
*   **D: Prajanan ke karan pakshi prajaati ke nirmaan ke bare me** - The passage explains the new species arose from breeding between two existing finch species.

Therefore, the only information missing from the passage is the name of the newly formed species."
Kalaatmak karyakram kha honge?,"The correct answer is **B: Bucharest city me**

Here's why:

The passage states the artistic event is part of the Bucharest City Hall's campaign. It specifically mentions Bucharest as the city being revitalized with a creative image. The event (Coupred) will be *organized* in Bucharest. 

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A:** The passage doesn't say the events will be in *many* Romanian cities.
* **C:** The passage specifies Bucharest, not all of Southeastern Europe.
* **D:** The passage focuses solely on Bucharest, not other major European cities.



"
Nimnalikhit mein se kaun sa kathan CowParade ka sateek varnan karta hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Yah duniya ka sabse bada saarvajanik calla karyakram hai** (This is the world's largest public art event).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""...is saal june aur agast ke beach duniya ka sabse bada saarvajanik calla karyakram, coupred ka ayojan karne wala dakshina-purvi europe ka yah pahala shaharhoga."" (This year, between June and August, this will be the first city in Southeastern Europe to organize Coupred, the world's largest public art event.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't say it *only* happens in ""creative"" cities, just that Bucharest is trying to project a creative image.
* **B:** While Bucharest City Hall is involved in the overall campaign, the passage focuses on Bucharest being the *host* of the Coupred event, which *is* the CowParade. It doesn't state they solely organized it.
* **C:** The passage says it's the first city in Southeastern Europe to host it, not that it happens throughout the region every summer.



"
Kis kaaran se rouse ne II-76s ka upayog karna band kar diya?,"The correct answer is **B: Durghatna ke Kaaran (Because of the accident)**.

The text states ""rouseneus durghatna ke baad il-76s ko kuch samay mein hi zameen par utaar diya"" which translates to ""After the Rousseneus accident, the Il-76s were grounded shortly.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aantarik sainikon ke kaaran (Because of space soldiers)** - The text mentions the plane *was* operated by airborne troops, but doesn't say this is why it was grounded.
*   **C: Soviyat senaaon ke kaaran (Because of Soviet armies)** - The text mentions the plane's history with Soviet armies, but not a reason for grounding.
*   **D: Uski jaanch baki thi (Its investigation was pending)** - While an investigation was launched, the text states the grounding happened *after* the accident, not because the investigation was ongoing.



"
II-76 kya hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Ek vimaan (An airplane)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Vimaan irkutsk ke or jaa raha tha..."" (An airplane was going towards Irkutsk...) and later refers to ""Il-76"" being involved in accidents and grounded.  These are all characteristics of an airplane.

The text also says: ""Il-76. 1970 ke dashakse hi russie aur soviyat senaaon ka mukhya ghatak raha hai."" (Il-76 has been a key component of the Russian and Soviet armies since the 1970s.) This suggests it is a military aircraft.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ek pandubbi (A submarine)** - The text describes something that flies, not something that travels underwater.
*   **B: Ek tank (A tank)** - Tanks are ground vehicles, not aircraft.
*   **D: Ek train (A train)** - Trains travel on tracks, not through the air.



"
The Simpsons ke liye kisne lekhan team ko niyukt kiya tha?,"The correct answer is **B: Saiman**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...1989 mein usne brooks aur groening ke saath the simpson ko rachane mein madad ke aur wah show ke pahali writing team ko niyukt karne ke liye uttardaayi tha.""  This translates to: ""...in 1989 he helped Brooks and Groening create The Simpsons and was responsible for hiring the show's first writing team.""

Therefore, Saiman was the one who hired the writing team."
"Fluke ke anusaar, use sakaaraatmak comment aur protsaahan kaun bhej raha tha?","The correct answer is **D: Mahila aur purush dono** (Both men and women).

The passage explicitly states: ""Mahila aur purush, dono ke orse bee sankhya mein mille sakaratmak comment aur protsaahan..."" which translates to ""Both men and women sent a large number of positive comments and encouragement...""

Therefore, Fluke was receiving positive comments and encouragement from both men and women.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, kuchh log nahin chaahate the ki mahilaen kis baare mein bolen?","Sahi jawab hai: **C: Mahilaaon ke swaasthya ke baare mein**

Passage mein saaf-saaf likha hai ki ""kuchh logon ne mahilaaon dwara mahilaaon ke swaasthya ke baare mein bulwaane ka prayaas kiya jismein way asafal rahe"".  Yeh seedhe-seedhe batata hai ki woh log chahte the ki mahilaaon ke swaasthya ke baare mein baat na ho.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Purusho ke baare mein:** Passage mein purusho ke baare mein kuch nahi kaha gaya hai.
* **B: Davaaon ke baare mein:** Passage mein davaaon ka zikr hai, lekin yeh nahi kaha gaya hai ki log chahte the ki davaaon ke baare mein baat na ho.  Asal mudda mahilaaon ke swaasthya ke baare mein baat karna tha.
* **D: Fluke ke baare mein:** ""Fluke"" ka zikr passage ki shuruaat mein ek example ke taur par kiya gaya hai, lekin yeh mudda nahi hai ki log kis baare mein baat karne se rokna chahte the.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, kaun sa grah sarvaadhik gatisheel hai?","The correct answer is **A: Dharti**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Stoffenne kahaa, jahan tak hum jaanate hain, ek hi aisaa grah hai, jo tyton ke tulna mein zyada gatishilata dikhaata hai aur uska naam hai, dharti.""  (Stoffenne said, as far as we know, there is only one planet that shows more dynamism than Tyton, and that is Earth.)

Therefore, according to the passage, Earth is the most dynamic planet."
Pardarshi taral padaarth se yukt nadiyon aur jheelon kee pahachaan kis grah par kee gaee hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Tyton**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Stoffenne kahaa, jahan tak hum jaanate hain, ek hi aisaa grah hai, jo tyton ke tulna mein zyada gatishilata dikhaata hai aur uska naam hai, dharti.""  This means Tyton is being compared to Earth, and the description of the transparent, water-like substance applies to Tyton.
* **The passage describes:** A transparent, fluid-like substance allowing visibility to the bottom of rivers/lakes. This is directly linked to Tyton in the provided text.

The other options are incorrect:

* **Shukra (Venus):** Not mentioned in relation to the transparent fluid.
* **Surya (Sun):** A star, not a planet with liquids.
* **Shani (Saturn):**  While Saturn has moons with potential subsurface oceans, it isn't described with this transparency in the passage.



"
Inamen se kaun sa nishkarsh pankh kee khoj ka parinaam nhi hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Janwar ke pankh ka rang (The animal's feather color)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Vaigyaanikon ka yah kahna hai ki is janwar ke romchhidra bhoore aur carotenoid ke niche ka rung bhura-bhura tha."" (Scientists say that the animal's filaments were brownish and the underlying color under carotenoids was mottled brown.)  This color information is *presented* as a finding *about* the feather, but it isn't a *conclusion drawn from* the discovery of the feather itself. The color was determined by examining the preserved filaments, not a conclusion reached because of the feather's structure.

Let's look at why the other options *are* conclusions drawn from the feather discovery:

* **B: Yah samajh ki pankhon ka upayog udaan mein nhi kiya jata tha (Understanding that feathers were not used for flight)** - The structure of the feathers (rachis instead of a fully developed shaft, presence of barbs and barbules) led researchers to conclude they were likely for display or temperature regulation.
* **C: Pankhon ke vikaas ki aham jankari (Important information about feather development)** - The discovery provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
* **D: Is baat ki pushti ki jyadatar dynasore ke pankha the (Confirmation that most dinosaurs had feathers)** - The text explicitly states the discovery supports the existing theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers.



"
Dynasore ke pankhon me kya nhi tha?,"The correct answer is **C: Viksit pankh** (Fully developed feathers).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""हालाँकि, डायनासोर के पंखों के शाफ्ट पूरी तरह से विकसित नहीं होते थे और उन्हें रेचिस कहा जाता था।"" (However, the shafts of the dinosaur's feathers were not fully developed and were called rachises).

This means the feathers were *not* fully developed.  The other options are mentioned as present:

*   **Barbules:** The passage states dinosaurs' feathers *had* barbs and barbules.
*   **Rachis:** The passage specifically mentions the presence of rachises (underdeveloped shafts).
*   **Neeche ka bhaag halke rang ka:** The passage discusses the colors found in the feathers.

Therefore, the only thing the dinosaur feathers *didn't* have was full development.



"
Zmapp ke baare me kaun sa kathan asatya hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Yah ilaaj karne ke liye hai, lekin maut ko nhi rok sakta**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while ZMapp initially showed promise, ""औपचारिक अध्ययनोने संकेत दिया कि मaut को रोकने में प्रत्याशित लाभ के तुलना में इसका लाभ कम था"" (formal studies indicated its benefit was less than expected in preventing death).  This means it *didn't* clearly prevent death, and the passage doesn't state it's a treatment that simply doesn't prevent death, but rather its effect is less than anticipated.

Let's look at why the other options are true:

*   **A: Yah antibody se banta hai** (It's made of antibodies) - The passage states it's an ""antibody cocktail.""
*   **C: Palm pareekshan mein, ek niyantran ke roop mein karya karta hai** (It acted as a control in the Palm trial) -  The passage explicitly says this: ""Palm pareekshan mein, ZMappne ek niyantran ke roop mein karya kiya...""
*   **D: Adhyayanon se pata chalata hai ki isake laabh, pratyaashit laabh se kam hain** (Studies show its benefits are less than expected) - This is also directly stated in the passage.



"
Inmen se kaun sa kathan Palm pareekshan ke bare me shi hai?,"The correct answer is **C: ZMapp ka istemal baseline ke roop mein kiya gya**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Palm pareekshan mein, zmappne ek niyantran ke roop mein karya kiya, jiska earth hai ki vaigyaanikonne ise baseline ke roop mein istemal kiya aur iske saath teen any upchaaron ke tulna ke.""  This directly translates to ""In the Palm trial, ZMapp acted as a control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared it with three other treatments.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Adhyayanonne me pta chla ki iske labh, pratyaashit labh se jyada hai** - The passage states the *opposite*: ZMapp's benefits were *less* than expected.
* **B: Niyantran ke roop mein teen any upchaaron ke sath tulna ke gyi, jisme se ek zmapp tha** - While ZMapp *was* used in comparison with other treatments, it wasn't *one of* the treatments being compared *to* – it *was* the baseline *for* the comparison.
* **D: Maujooda condition a ilaaj karne me saksham tha** - The passage says no drugs are *proven* to treat Ebola, and specifically mentions ZMapp didn't show the expected benefit.



"
Shodhakartaon ke hisab se naee chip sabase jyada upyogi kahaa hogi?,"The correct answer is **A: Alp aaya waale deshon mein**.

The passage explicitly states: ""यह अल्प आया वाले देशों में कैंसर, टीवी, एचआईवी और मलेरिया के रोगियों के आसानी से पहचान करेगा..."" (This will easily identify patients with cancer, TB, HIV and malaria in low-income countries...).

Therefore, the inventors believe the new chip will be most useful in low-income countries.



"
Diagnostic tool ke nirmaan ke lie kis vidhi ka upayog kiya jaega?,"The correct answer is **B: Standard inkjet printer**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the chip is manufactured ""using a standard inkjet printer.""  The cost (A) is the *result* of the method, and the chip (C) is the *product* of the method. ""Anya diagnostic tool"" (D) is irrelevant.

Therefore, the method used for construction is the standard inkjet printer.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, lobet scarps ke baare mein kaun sa kathan saty nahin hai?","The correct answer is **D: Ve chanda ke satah par jyada nhi hai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yeprapaat pure chandrama par paaye gaye..."" (They have been found all over the moon...) This directly contradicts the idea that they are *not* abundant on the moon's surface.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

* **A: Hall hi mein bane hai (Were formed recently):** The passage states they appear ""nyuntam roop se mausam ke karan raaba hue dikhai dete hain"" (show little evidence of weathering), indicating recent formation.
* **B: Chand puri tarah se bhoogarbhiya gatividhise rahit nhi hai (The moon is not entirely devoid of geological activity):**  The passage says the discovery ""is siddhant is daave ka khandan karta hai ki chand puri tarah se bhoogarbhiya gatividhise rahit hai"" (contradicts the theory that the moon is completely devoid of geological activity).
* **C: Chandrama ke sikudane ke vajah se hue hain (Were caused by the shrinking of the moon):** The passage explicitly states they are ""chanda ke satah par lobet scarps namak kharab hue landforms ke khoj ke hai jo saaf taur par chandrama ke sikudane ke vajah se hue hain"" (lobate scarps found on the moon's surface, clearly caused by the shrinking of the moon).

Therefore, option D is the only statement *not* supported by the provided text.

"Passage ke hisab se, bhoo-aakrtiyon ke sambandh mein kaun sa siddhaant bataata hai ki chandrama par bhoogarbhiya gatividhi ho rahee hai?","The correct answer is **D: Hall hi mein bani hai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...jo yah darshaata hai ki kisi bhoogarbhiya ghatnaaonne unhein hall hi mein banaaya tha."" (which translates to ""...which indicates that some geological event created them recently."") This directly supports the idea of ongoing geological activity on the moon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Chandrama sikud rha hai (The moon is shrinking):** While the passage mentions the shrinking of the moon *caused* the landforms, the landforms themselves are the *evidence* of ongoing activity, not the theory itself.
* **B: Bhoo-aakrtiyan bhut pahle bni thi (The landforms were formed a long time ago):** The passage explicitly contradicts this, saying they appear *recently* formed.
* **C: Chandrama par inki sankhya bhut kam hai (Their number on the moon is very small):** The passage states they've been found *across* the moon, implying they aren’t rare.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, abhiyog lagane tak aur kya nahin hoga?","The correct answer is **A: Tippani nahin ke jaayegi**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Crown office...ne patrakaron ko sanket diya hai ki kamse kam abhiyog lagane tak koi tippani nahin ke jaayegi."" This directly translates to ""The Crown Office...has indicated to journalists that no comment will be made until at least charges are filed.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tasveeron ka prakashan nhi hoga** - The passage mentions concerns about the publication of photos *having already happened* and its potential impact, but doesn't state a prohibition on it. It notes courts view publication as potentially prejudicial.
*   **C: Chashmadid gawah pr baat nhi hogi** - The passage states witnesses *could* be influenced, not that they won't be spoken to.
*   **D: Article ka prakashan nhi hoga** - The passage doesn't mention a ban on articles, only on *comment* from the Crown Office.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, sealers ke liye vartamaan samasya kya nahin hai?","The correct answer is **D: Pighalti barf**.

Here's why:

The passage states the problems are ""tez barfbari"" (heavy snowfall) and ""kharab isthiti"" (bad weather conditions). It also specifically mentions ""pek barf ke matra aur motai"" (amount and thickness of ice) as the worst in 15 years for sealers.  The passage does *not* mention melting ice as a problem.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mausam ke kharab isthiti (Bad weather conditions):** The passage explicitly states this *is* a problem.
* **B: Tez barfbari (Heavy snowfall):** The passage explicitly states this *is* a problem.
* **C: Barf ke motai (Thickness of ice):** The passage explicitly states this *is* a problem.



"
"Barf ke alawa, bachaav ke prayason par aur kiska prabhaav pad raha hai?","The correct answer is **B: Mausam ke isthiti** (Weather conditions).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tez barfbari ke alawa, **mausam ke kharab isthiti** bachaav ke prayason mein bada bn rahi hai.""  This directly translates to ""Besides heavy snowfall, **bad weather conditions** are increasing problems in rescue efforts.""

The question asks what *else* is affecting rescue efforts besides snow. The passage explicitly identifies bad weather.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aapurti ki kami** (Shortage of supplies) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Madad ki kami** (Lack of help) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Sealers** - The passage mentions sealers *are affected* by the weather, but aren't causing problems for the rescue efforts.



"
Roberts ne kis chiz par apne vichaar prakat karne se manna kar diya?,"The correct answer is **C: Jeevan ki shuruat par**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Garbhpaat ke naitikta par vichaar karte samay ek mahatvapurn sawal, **jeevan kab shuru hota hai** par sambhaavit mamalon ke baarikiyon par tippani karne ko anaitik bataate hue robertsne is par apne vichaar prakat karne se saann-saann manna kar diya.""  (While considering the ethics of abortion, Roberts refused to express his views on the important question of **when life begins**, stating that commenting on the nuances of potential cases would be unethical.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Case par vichar krne ki naitikta par:** While the passage mentions ethics, Roberts didn't refuse to comment on the ethics *of considering the case*, but specifically on the question of when life begins.
*   **B: Uchchatam nyayalaya ke susangat nirnayon ke mahatva par:** He *reaffirmed* his belief in this, he didn't refuse to comment on it.
*   **D: Gopaniyata ke nihit adhikaron par:** He *confirmed* his belief in this, he didn't refuse to comment on it.



"
Roberts ko kis vishay par baat karna naitikta ke khilaf lgta tha?,"The correct answer is **D: Cases ki khas baton par** (Details of the cases).

Here's why:

The passage states Roberts ""refused to offer his views on the matter, seemingly reluctant to delve into the nuances of potential cases, deeming it unethical to comment on the specifics."" This directly indicates he felt it was unethical to discuss the details (or ""nuances"") of individual cases related to the ethics of abortion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uchchatam nyayalaya ke nirnayon par** (On Supreme Court decisions) - While he acknowledged the importance of precedent, he didn't refuse to discuss Supreme Court decisions *in general*.
*   **B: Roe v. Wade nirnay par** (On the Roe v. Wade decision) - He reaffirmed his previous statement about Roe v. Wade being ""settled law.""
*   **C: Gopaniyata ke nihit adhikaron par** (On inherent rights to privacy) - He explicitly stated he believes in the right to privacy.



"
Prakash ke do kirane kha chahmak rhi hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Aasmaan me (In the sky)**.

The text states: ""Ratbhar aasmaan ke or dekhne ke liye prakash ke do kiranon ko taiyar kiya gaya hai.""  This translates to ""Two beams of light were prepared to look at the sky all night.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pure shahar me (In the whole city):** The text doesn't say the light beams illuminate the entire city.
* **C: Pehle jett ke nishane par (On the target of the first jet):**  The light beams are for *looking* at the sky, not targeting a jet.
* **D: Smaarak park me (In the memorial park):** The text mentions a memorial park, but doesn't connect the light beams to it.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, site par naee gaganachumbee imaaraten kab banaee ja rahee hain?","The correct answer is **D: Kam chal raha hai** (Work is in progress).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Site par panchnei gaganchumbi imaraton par **kam chal raha hai**..."" which translates to ""Work is in progress on five skyscraper buildings at the site..."" 

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dopahar me** (In the afternoon) - The passage doesn't mention afternoon construction.
* **B: Subah 8:46 baje** (At 8:46 am) - This refers to a moment of silence, not construction.
* **C: Ratbhar** (All night) - This refers to preparing lights, not building construction.



"
Kis jankari pta chlta hai ki saaton bahanen gufaaen hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Tapman se (Temperature)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ""saat bahanen"" caves exhibit a temperature behavior - being cooler during the day and warmer at night - that is *similar to other caves*. This temperature fluctuation is the key indicator that these formations are, in fact, caves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Gufaaon me ghusane ke jagah ka diameter (Diameter of the cave entrances):** While the diameter is mentioned, it doesn't *prove* they are caves, it just describes a characteristic of their entrances. Many things can have a large diameter opening.
*   **C: Geological survey (Geological survey):** The USGS is *studying* them, but the survey itself doesn't define what they *are*.
*   **D: Prithvi par gufaaon ke chitra (Images of caves on Earth):** Images would show what caves *look* like, but the passage doesn't mention images being used to identify these formations.



"
Saaton bahano ka tapman kaise pta chlta hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Infrared chitra se** (From infrared images).

The passage explicitly states: ""Infrared chitra dikhaate hain ki raat aur din ke badale tapmanse way kuchh-kuchh gufaaen jaisi hain."" (Infrared images show that some caves behave like they change temperature with night and day). This directly indicates that infrared images are used to determine the temperature of the Seven Sisters caves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: prithvi ke badee gufaaon se** (From the Earth's large caves) - The passage *compares* the temperature behavior to larger caves, but doesn't say temperature is *determined* from them.
* **C: Gufaaon me ghusane ke jagah ke diameter se** (From the diameter of the cave entrances) - The diameter is mentioned, but doesn't relate to temperature.
* **D: Prithvi par gufaaon ke survey se** (From surveying caves on Earth) - While a survey might *include* temperature readings, the passage specifically highlights infrared images as the method.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, sandigdh ke baare mein kaun sa kathan satya nhi hai?","The correct answer is **C: Uski jaati adhikariyon ko pata hai** (His ethnicity is known to officials).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Uska naam abhi bhi adhikariyon ko pata nahin hai, haalaanki way jaanate hain ki wah uighar jaatiya samooh ka sadasya hai."" (His name is not yet known to officials, although they know he is a member of the Uighur ethnic group.) This means while they know his *ethnic group* (Uighur), they don't know his specific *identity* or ""jaati"" which can encompass more than just ethnicity.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

* **A: Usne hamla karte samay vaahan ka istemal kiya** (He used a vehicle during the attack) - The passage says a three-wheeled vehicle was used.
* **B: Usne kathit taur par visfot kiya** (He allegedly detonated) - The passage describes an explosion and someone being arrested from the rubble.
* **D: Use chotein nhi aai** (He wasn't injured) -  The passage states ""use kuch chotein aai hain"" (he sustained some injuries). Therefore, this statement is false.



"
Adhikaariyon ne hamale ke sambandh mein kis jaanakaaree kee pushti kee hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Uski jaati** (His ethnicity).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""हालांकि अधिकारियों को उसका नाम अभी भी पता नहीं है, हालांकि वे जानते हैं कि वह उइगर जातीय समूह का सदस्य है।"" (Although officials do not yet know his name, they do know that he is a member of the Uyghur ethnic group.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uske aathee ki pahachaan** (His attacker's identity) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the attacker's identity, only the perpetrator of the bombing.
* **C: Hamle ka uddeshya** (The purpose of the attack) - The passage doesn't provide any information about the motive behind the attack.
* **D: Uska naam** (His name) - The passage clearly states his name is *not* yet known.



"
Ellis Park me kaun si team match khelegi?,"The correct answer is **C: South Africa aur Australia** (South Africa and Australia).

The passage states: ""is seereez ka final match springbox aur australia ke beach, agle hafte johannesburg ke ellis park mein khela jayega."" (The final match of this series will be played between Springbox and Australia next week at Ellis Park in Johannesburg). ""Springbox"" is a nickname for the South African rugby team.
"
Springbox agla match kha khelegi?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

The text states: ""is seereez ka final match springbox aur australia ke beach, agle hafte johannesburg ke ellis park mein khela jayega."" (The final match of this series will be played between Springbox and Australia next week at Ellis Park in Johannesburg.)"
Space station mission ke dauraan kisase pareshaanee huee?,"Sahi jawab hai **B: Gyroscope rakhne se**.

P passage mein saaf-saaf bataya gaya hai ki spacewalk ke ant tak space station mission mein pehle ek gyroscope ke nuksan hua tha. Yahi pareshaani thi jisne station ko apna rukh banae rakhne mein mushkil paari.

Baaki options galat hain kyunki:

*   **A:** Thruster se doori banaana pareshaani nahi thi, balki us pareshaani (gyroscope ke nuksan) se bachne ke liye ek kadaam tha.
*   **C:** Jets ko activate karna pareshaani ka hal tha, pareshaani nahi.
*   **D:** Normal attitude hassil karna pareshaani ke khatm hone ka parinaam tha, pareshaani nahi."
Passage ke anusaar space station ke mission ka lakshay kya tha?,"The correct answer is **C: Spacewalk poori karna**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the spacewalk *happened* despite a gyroscope failure. The focus is on maintaining the station's orientation *so the spacewalk could continue*. The other options are details of *how* they dealt with the problem, not the overall goal of the mission described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Khoye hue gyroscope khojna:** The passage says the gyroscope was damaged, not lost, and the mission wasn't about finding it.
*   **B: Samayojan thruster ke kareeb pahuchna:** The passage mentions maintaining a safe distance from the thrusters, not getting close to them.
*   **D: Jets ko activate karna:** Activating the jets was a *solution* to a problem, not the mission's goal.



"
Inmein se kaun sa kathan is mamle ke bare mein shi nhi hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Is par us rajya mein mukadama chalaya gaya AOL ka mukhyalay tha**.

Here's why:

The passage states Virginia was the location of the trial *because* it was the home of AOL, the company that initiated the allegations. This implies the trial location wasn't directly *because* it was AOL's headquarters, but because of a connection to the allegations originating from AOL being based there. It’s a subtle but important distinction.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **B: Vishwaas haasil kiya gaya:** The passage explicitly states “vishwaas hassil kiya gaya” (a conviction was secured).
*   **C: Mamle mein spam email se sambandhit kanoon ka istemaal kiya gya:** The passage mentions the use of a 2003 law designed to stop bulk email and spam.
*   **D: AOL par aarop lagaya ja rha tha:**  The passage states AOL was the company “jisane aaropon ko uksaayaa” (that instigated the allegations).



"
Inme se konsa kathan mamle ka sahi varnan karta hai?,"The correct answer is **A: AOL par anchaahe distributor ka aarop lagaya gaya tha** (AOL was accused of unwanted distribution).

Here's why:

* The passage states the case was brought because AOL (a leading internet service provider) was ""the home"" of the company that *instigated the accusations*. This directly implies AOL was accused of something relating to the bulk emails and spam.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Is case mein do mukhya internet seva pradaata shamil the** (This case involved two major internet service providers) - The passage only explicitly mentions AOL.
* **C: Is mamle par 2003 mein mukadama chalaya gaya tha** (This case was tried in 2003) - The passage states the *law* used in the case was created in 2003, not that the trial was *in* 2003.
* **D: Aol ne mukadama shuru kiya tha** (AOL started the lawsuit) - The passage says AOL was the target of accusations, not the initiator of the lawsuit.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Vidal ne teen season pehle kis club mein khelna shuru kiya tha?","The correct answer is **A: Sevilla**.

The passage states: ""28 varshiya vidal teen season pehle sevillase barka mein shamil hue the.""  This translates to ""28-year-old Vidal joined Barça from Sevilla three seasons ago.""  Therefore, he started playing for Sevilla three seasons prior to joining Barça."
Vidal ne Barça ke liye kitne game khele?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The passage states: ""Vidal ne club ke liye 49 game khele the."" (Vidal played 49 games for the club.)
"
Match mein virodhi team kon thi?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

The text explicitly states: ""way ravivaar ko bolonia ke khilaaf yojnabaddh matchse pehle team hotel mein thahare the"" (They were staying at the team hotel before the scheduled match against Bologna on Sunday). 

Therefore, Bolonia was the opposing team in the match.



"
Jerkus hotel mein kyun ruka tha?,"The correct answer is **C: Sunday ke match ke liye (For the Sunday match)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""way ravivaar ko bolonia ke khilaaf yojnabaddh matchse pehle team hotel mein thahare the"" - which translates to ""they stayed at the team hotel before the scheduled match against Bologna on Sunday."" This directly links their hotel stay to the upcoming match.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Abhyas ke liye (For practice):** They were *already* practicing in Coverciano. Staying at the hotel wasn't *for* practice itself.
* **B: Pri-season meeting ke liye (For a pre-season meeting):** The passage doesn't mention any meetings.
* **D: Bolonia ke sath training ke liye (For training with Bologna):**  They were playing *against* Bologna, not training with them.



"
Jakarta bhubhautiki agency chetavani jaari kyun nhi karegi?,"The correct answer is **D: yah bhookamp ke liye parmiaan ke aavashyakta ko pura nahin karta tha.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...*koi sunami ke chetavani jaari bhi nahin ke jaayegi kyonki bhookamp 6.5 ke aavashyakta ko pura nahin karta tha*."" (no tsunami warning will be issued because the earthquake did not meet the 6.5 requirement).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sunami ka koi khatra nhi tha** - While true, this is a *result* of why no warning was issued, not the *reason* the agency wouldn't issue it.
*   **B: Nivaasiyon ke beech dahashat failne se rokne ke liye** - The passage doesn't suggest this was a motivating factor for the agency.
*   **C: Sthaniya karobaaron ko hone wale asar se bachane ke liye** -  This isn't mentioned as a reason.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, bhookamp ka karan kya tha?","The correct answer is **D: Parimaan paimaane par 6.5**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""koi sunami ke chetavani jaari nahin ke gayi hai...kyonki bhookamp 6.5 ke aavashyakta ko pura nahin karta tha."" This directly tells us the earthquake *was* 6.5 in magnitude, and it was this magnitude that was the *reason* a tsunami warning wasn't issued.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sthaniya logon ke beech dahashat (Fear among locals):** While fear was a *result* of the earthquake, it wasn't the cause of the earthquake itself.
* **B: Sunami ka khatra (Tsunami threat):**  The passage explicitly states there was *no* tsunami threat.
* **C: Jaari ki gayi chetavani (Issued warning):** No warning was issued.



"
Inme se kis wajah se surya aur any sitaaron ki gatividhi sanchaalit hoti hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Parikraman aur Prakash** (Rotation and Light).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""mandal ke sabhi sitaaron ke gatividhi unke prakash, unke parikraman dwara sanchaalit thi, kisi aur karanse nahin."" (The activity of all stars in the galaxy was governed by their light, their rotation, and no other cause).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Prakash aur plasma flow (Light and plasma flow):** While plasma flow is *related* to the Rosby number, the passage doesn't say it *directly* governs activity.
* **B: Rosby sankhya, parikraman, aur chumbakiya utkraman (Rosby number, rotation, and magnetic evolution):** The Rosby number is a *result* of the activity, used to measure it, not a primary driver.  Magnetic evolution is a consequence of activity, not a cause.
* **D: Prakash, Rosby sankhya, aur parikraman (Light, Rosby number, and rotation):**  Similar to B, Rosby number is a measurement *of* activity, not a cause of it.



"
Kisi sitare ki Rosby sankhya ko kese nirdharit kiya jata hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Prakash aur Parikraman** (Brightness and Rotation).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...ek taare ke rosby sankhya...ka pata lagaane ke liye uski chamak aur rotation ka ek saath istemal kiya jaataa hai"" which translates to ""...to determine a star's Rossby number... its brightness and rotation are used together.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Plasma flow ki matra (Amount of plasma flow):** While Rossby number *relates* to plasma flow, the passage doesn't say that the *amount* of plasma flow is directly measured to find the Rossby number.
*   **C: Gatividhi ka star (Level of activity):**  The passage states the Rossby number *indicates* activity level, but doesn't say it's *how* it's determined.
*   **D: Chumbakiya utkraman ki matra (Amount of magnetic evolution):** Similar to C, magnetic evolution is a *result* related to the Rossby number, not how it's calculated.



"
Survey mein hissa lene wale kitne prathishat log Australia ko turant gantantra banana chahte the?,"The correct answer is **B: 29 prathisha**.

The passage states: ""Survey ke natije ke mutabik, survey mein shamil 29 pratishat logon ka maanana hai ki Australia ko jaldse jald ek gantantra ban jaanaa chaahiye..."" (According to the survey results, 29 percent of those surveyed believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible...).

Therefore, 29% of the surveyed people wanted Australia to become a republic immediately."
"Julia gillard, Australia ko kab gantantra banana chaahiye?","The correct answer is **B: Raani Elizabeth dwiteeya ke shasankal ke baad**.

The text specifically states: ""Karyavahak pradhaanmantri julia gillard ne 2010 ke sanghiya chunaav ke campaign ke dauran daava kiya ki wah maanti hain ki raani elizabeth dwiteeya ke shasankal ke ant mein Australia ko ek gantantra banana chaahiye.""  This translates to: ""Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jald se jald** - The survey shows 29% believe this, but it's *not* what Gillard stated.
* **C: Kabhi nhin** - The survey shows 31% believe this, but it's *not* what Gillard stated.
* **D: Federal election ke baad** - The text doesn't link Gillard's view to the election timeframe. It's tied to the Queen's reign.



"
Kis sanstha par kanuni jaanch chal rahi hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Niyojit parenthood**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Cliff Sterns is investigating whether funds from Planned Parenthood were used for abortions while he was chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. This clearly indicates a legal investigation *into* Planned Parenthood.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: House energy end comers kameti:** This committee is *conducting* the investigation, not *under* investigation.
*   **B: Comen sanstha:** Comen Sanstha is the one *imposing* the new rules based on ongoing investigations, it isn't the subject of one.
*   **D: Overdite end investigations upasamiti:** This is the subcommittee Cliff Sterns *led*, so it's related to the investigation, but not being investigated itself.



"
Cliff Stearns kis kameti ke head hain?,"The correct answer is **D: Overdite end investigations upasamiti**.

The text specifically states: ""Sterns is baat ke jaanch kar rahe hain ki kya karon ka istemal overdite end investigations upasamiti ke adhyaksh ke roop mein unaki bhoomika mein niyojit parenthood ke madhyamse garbhpaat ke liye kiya jaataa hai.""  This translates to ""Sterns is investigating whether funds were used for abortions through Planned Parenthood in his role as chairman of the Oversight and Investigations subcommittee.""

Therefore, Cliff Stearns is the head of the Overdite end investigations upasamiti (Oversight and Investigations subcommittee).



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Swiss mahila ke sath kya nhi hua tha?","The correct answer is **B: Use maar diya gaya tha**.

Here's why:

The passage states the police arrested five people for **raping** a Swiss woman (balatkar karna - means rape). It does *not* mention anything about her being killed. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chori hua samaan baramad hua** - This is true, the passage states her laptop and phone were recovered.
*   **C: Uske sath 5 logo ne yaun utpidan kiya** - This is also true, as 'balatkar' directly translates to rape/sexual assault.
*   **D: Uska phone aur laptop chori hua tha** - This is true, the passage mentions recovery of her stolen phone and laptop.



"
2007 mein kis company ko taiwan sustainable awardse sammaanit kiya gaya?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The passage explicitly states: ""chini ganarajya ke karyakari yuan dwara 2007 mein asus ko taiwan sustainable awardse sammaanit kiye jaane ke baad..."" (in 2007, ASUS was honored by the Executive Yuan of the People's Republic of China with the Taiwan Sustainable Award...).



"
ASUS Eee PC kya hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Laptop**.

The passage clearly states ""laptop computer"" in reference to the ASUS Eee PC. It talks about the consumer market for laptops becoming more diverse and specifically mentions the ASUS Eee PC as a type of laptop.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Smartphone** - The passage doesn't mention smartphones.
* **C: Tablet** - The passage doesn't mention tablets.
* **D: Pager** - Pagers are outdated technology and not discussed in the passage.



"
Kiski wajah se dock dastaavezon khoye the?,"The correct answer is **C: Ladka (Boys)**.

The passage states ""ladkene...429 postcard sahit 600se zyada dock dastaavezon ko chhipaaya tha"" which translates to ""boys hid more than 600 dock documents including 429 New Year postcards"".  This clearly indicates the boys were responsible for the missing documents.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, khoye hue dastaavezon ke liye kisne maafinama likha?","The correct answer is **D: Obnazwa post office**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Call, dakgharne nagrikon aur media ko apni maafee jaari ke..."" This translates to ""The post office issued an apology to citizens and the media...""

Therefore, the Obnazwa post office wrote the apology for the missing documents.



"
Potro ne kab apne kandhe ka ilaaj karvaaya?,"The correct answer is **C: Dusre sett ke dauran** (During the second set).

The text states: ""Potrone is point par apne kandhe ka ilaaj karvaaya lekin khel mein vaapsee karne mein kamyab rahe."" and it clearly says this happened *after* they reached 6-6 in the *second* set.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pehle sett ke dauran** (During the first set) - The text says he lost the first set.
*   **B: Pehle tyee break se pehle** (Before the first tie-break) - The tie-break happened *after* he lost the first set.
*   **D: Teesre tyee break ke baad** (After the third tie-break) - The text only mentions a tie-break being necessary in the second set.



"
Pehle tyee break ka kya natiza tha?,"The correct answer is **A: Marey pahala sett haar gaye**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Sett mein ek-ek service dono purushon ke paas rahne ke baad marey tyee breaker mein pahala sett haar gaya."" (After each player had a service in the set, Marey lost the first set in the tie-breaker.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Del Potro apni chot ki wajah se haar gaye:** The passage says Del Potro *received treatment* for his shoulder, but it doesn't say he lost *because* of the injury.
* **C: Marey ne dusra sett jeeta:** The passage only states the second set was tied 6-6 and went to a tie-break, but doesn't mention who won it.
* **D: Del Potro ne dusra sett jeeta:** Similar to C, the passage doesn't state the outcome of the second set.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, kon vishesh rup se ak rogi ke sampark mein aya tha?","The correct answer is **B: Bachch (Children)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Governorne yah bhi kahaa, """"aaj, hamein pata chalaa hai ki kuch schooly umr ke bachchon ke pehchaan hui hai jinka rogise sampark tha""""."" 

This translates to: ""The Governor also said, 'Today, we learned that some school-aged children have been identified who had contact with the infected.'""

Therefore, the passage specifically states *children* were identified as having been in contact with someone who was infected.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Governor ne Texas ke logon ko kya bharosa dilaaya?","The correct answer is **B: Logon ki suraksha ke liye kaam kiye jaa rahe hain**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Una adhikariyon ke saath unhone texas ke logon ko **bharosa dilaaya ki unaki suraksha ke liye kadam uthaaye jaa rahe hain**."" (They assured the people of Texas that steps are being taken for their safety.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: System acche se kaam kar raha hai** - While the Governor *says* the system is working as expected, this is a *result* of the assurance about safety, not the primary assurance itself.
*   **C: We chunauti ka samna karne ke liye taiyar hain** - The passage mentions the Governor saying there are few places in the world equipped to handle the challenge, but doesn’t explicitly say they are *ready* to face it.
*   **D: Mamla gambhir nahin hai** - The Governor specifically states ""Yah mamla gambhir hai."" (This matter is serious).



"
UW ke do purva chaatron ne konsa samachar parody source banaya tha?,"The correct answer is **D: Tha aniyan**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""heck and johnsonne ek prakashan ke kalpana ke, jo samachar aur samachar reporting ke parody karega -"". It then goes on to describe how this publication, ""dha aniyan,"" grew into a large parody empire. While the passage mentions *The Daily Show* and *The Colbert Report* as shows influenced by *Tha aniyan*'s writers, *Tha aniyan* itself is the source they created.

"Passage ke hisab se, inms se kon Tha anyian ke samachar parody samrajya mein shaamil nhin hai?","Sahi jawab hai **B: Film**.

Passage mein anyian ke samachar parody samrajya mein shaamil cheezein hain:

*   Print sanskaran

"Passage ke hisab se, police kiski suraksha kar rahi thi?","सही जवाब है **C: Downing Street ke darwaaje**

टेक्स्ट में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि विरोध प्रधानमंत्री के आधिकारिक आवास डाउनिंग स्ट्रीट के पुलिस-पहरेदार दरवाजे के सामने शुरू हुआ। इसका मतलब है कि पुलिस डाउनिंग स्ट्रीट के दरवाजे की सुरक्षा कर रही थी।

अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि:

*   **A: Traanalgar square** - प्रदर्शनकारी वहां गए थे, लेकिन पुलिस वहां सुरक्षा नहीं कर रही थी।
*   **B: Spring poram** - पुलिस इस कार्यक्रम की सुरक्षा नहीं कर रही थी, प्रदर्शनकारी वहां जा रहे थे।
*   **D: grand cannot room hotel** - पुलिस होटल की सुरक्षा नहीं कर रही थी, बल्कि प्रदर्शनकारियों को वहां पहुंचने से रोकने की कोशिश कर रही थी।"
Police ne traffic se bachane ke lie virodh karne waale logon ko kis samay hatane ke lie kaha?,"The correct answer is **D: 11:20 baje**.

The text states: ""11:20 par, policene pradarshankariyon ko yah kahte hue footpath par vaapas jaane ke liye kahaa ki unhein bhid ikattha karne ke saath virodh karne ke adhikar ko santulit karne ke zaroorat hai."" (At 11:20, police asked the protesters to go back to the sidewalk, saying they needed to balance their right to protest with gathering a crowd.)

This directly answers the question.



"
Dr. ehood ke kiye gaye shodh ke bare mein kya sach hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Madhumeh se pidit kuch choohon ko ab madhumeh nhin hai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Unhone kahaa """"ki ab hamare paas 4 mahine umr vaale choohe hain jinhen madhumeh nahin hai jo madhumeh ke rogi the."""" (They said that they now have 4-month-old mice who do not have diabetes who were diabetic patients.)""  This directly translates to some mice *previously* with diabetes no longer having it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ye nishkarsh unke liye faydemand ho sakte hain Jinhe pahle se type 1 madhumeh hai** - The passage specifically states Dr. Ehood doubts the relevance of these findings for those *already* with type 1 diabetes.
* **C: Unhe bharosa hai ki nishkarshon se ilaaj ho sakta hai** - The passage states he *doubts* diabetes can be cured.
* **D: Jin choohon ko madhumeh nhin tha unhe ab madhumeh hai** - The passage doesn't mention anything about mice *without* diabetes developing it.



"
Passage ke hisab se Dr. Ur ko kis baat mein sandeh hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Madhumeh ko thik kiya jaa sakta hai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*unhein is baat par sandeh hai ki kya madhumeh ko thik kiya jaa sakta hai...*"" This directly translates to ""he doubts whether diabetes can be cured.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nishkarsh type 1 madhumeh wale logon ke liye prasangik hai** - The passage says he doubts the relevance *to* those with type 1 diabetes, not that the results *are* relevant.
*   **C: Ilaaj ke sambandh mein any visheshagyon kee raay** - The passage mentions he shares this doubt *with* some other specialists, not that he doubts *their* opinions.
*   **D: Jin choohon ko madhumen nhin hai ve aise hi rahenge** - The passage doesn't mention anything about the future of the mice that don't have diabetes.



"
Inme se konsa kathan flight cg4684 ki Durghatna ka sahi vranan nhin karta hai?,"सही उत्तर है **C: Durghatna hone se pehle flight ne teen baar land karne ki koshish ki**.

टेक्स्ट में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि विमान ने एक बार लैंडिंग का प्रयास किया, लेकिन उसे रद्द कर दिया गया। यह नहीं कहा गया है कि उसने तीन बार प्रयास किया। 

अन्य विकल्प टेक्स्ट में दी गई जानकारी से मेल खाते हैं:

*   **A:** फ्लाइट खराब मौसम के कारण लैंड नहीं कर पाई - यह टेक्स्ट में स्पष्ट है।
*   **B:** फ्लाइट दुर्गम स्थान पर दुर्घटनाग्रस्त हुई - टेक्स्ट में कहा गया है कि दुर्घटनास्थल दुर्गम था।
*   **D:** फ्लाइट की दुर्घटनास्थल की तलाश मौसम के कारण प्रभावित हुई - टेक्स्ट में कहा गया है कि खराब मौसम ने खोज में बाधा डाली।"
Flight CG4684 kis wajah se land nhi kar paya?,"Correct answer is **D: Mausam kharab tha**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Khoj meinus kharab mausam ke karan rukawat paida hui thi jiski vajah se landing nahin ho paayee thi"" which translates to ""The search was hampered by bad weather which prevented landing.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Landing sthan durgam tha:** While the crash site *was* remote, the passage states the landing couldn't happen *because* of the weather, not because of the remote location.
*   **B: CG4684 ke aage kai anya flight the:** This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Flight ko phir se kokoda bheja gaya:** The passage indicates the flight was *attempting* to land, not being rerouted.

"Passage ke hisab se, franciszek koval ke anubhav ke bare mein konsa kathan sach hai?","The correct answer is **B: Unhe kuch nahin hua tha** (They were unharmed).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Saubhagya se mujhe kuch nahin hua..."" which translates to ""Luckily, nothing happened to me...""  This directly tells us Franciszek Kovalne was not harmed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Unhone khidaki todi** (They broke the window) - The passage says *others* were trying to break the window, and eventually *a* window broke, but doesn't say Franciszek broke it.
*   **C: Bahar nikalte samay unhone kursi todi** (They broke a chair while leaving) - The passage says people were hitting the glass *with* chairs, not breaking them while escaping.
*   **D: Khidki todte samay unhe chot lagi** (They were injured while breaking the window) - The passage explicitly states they were unharmed.

Ushnakatibandhiya toofan denial ke sambhaavit prabhaav ka aaklan karna mushkil kyun hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Toofan bhuskhalanse bahut door hai** (The storm is very far away).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Choonki toofan bhuskhalanse bahut door hai, isliye sanyukt rajya america yaa carribean mein sambhaavit prabhaav ka aaklan karna mushkil hai."" (Because the storm is very far away, it is difficult to assess the possible impact in the United States or the Caribbean.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Toofan shaktishali toofan ka roop le lega** (The storm will become a strong storm) - This describes a *prediction* about the storm, not *why* assessment is difficult.
*   **B: Toofan ki tez havaaon ke baare mein vaigyaanik anishchit hain** (Scientists are uncertain about the storm's strong winds) - The passage doesn't mention uncertainty about wind speed.
*   **D: Toofan Miami se bahut door hai** (The storm is very far from Miami) - While true, the passage focuses on difficulty assessing impact in the US and Caribbean *generally*, not just relative to Miami.  The distance is a factor in assessing overall impact, not just location.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Ushnakatibandhiya toofan denial ke bare mein inme se konsa kathan sahi nhin hai?","The correct answer is **D: yah bhuskhalanse ke pass hai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Choonki toofan bhuskhalanse bahut door hai..."" (Because the storm is very far from the mainland...).  This directly contradicts the statement that it's near the mainland.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Carribean mein iske sambhaavit prabhaav ke bare mein koi jankari nhin hai:** The passage says ""Choonki toofan bhuskhalanse bahut door hai, isliye sanyukt rajya america yaa carribean mein sambhaavit prabhaav ka aaklan karna mushkil hai."" (Because the storm is very far from the mainland, it is difficult to estimate the possible impact in the United States or the Caribbean). This means there *is* no information about its potential impact on the Caribbean.
* **B: Atlantic mahasagar mein banaa hai:** The passage states ""Ushnakatibandhiya toofan denial, 2010 atlantic toofan ke mausam ka chautha naamit toofan purvi atlantic mahasagar mein banaa hai."" (Tropical storm Denial, the fourth named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.)
* **C: Yah shaktishali toofan ka roop le sakta hai:**  The passage says ""National hariken centre ke vaigyaanikon ka purvanuman hai ki denial budhwar tak shaktishali toofan ka roop le legaa."" (Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that Denial will become a powerful hurricane by Wednesday.)

"Passage ke hisab se, vaishvik mahamari banne se pehle bimari ke sath kya karne ka sujhav diya gaya hai?","The correct answer is **A: Ise kam ghatak banana hoga (It needs to be made less lethal)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Unhone kahaa ki kuch adhyayanonse pata chalta hai ki vaishvik mahamari ka karan bananese pehle bimari kam ghaatak ho sakti hai."" This directly translates to ""She said that some studies suggest that the disease causing a global pandemic might initially be less lethal.""

The passage expresses *concern* about a less lethal disease spreading more easily because mild symptoms would allow people to continue their routines and infect others. The *suggestion* implied is that reducing the lethality is a characteristic of the disease *before* it becomes a pandemic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: lakshan halke bane rahene chaiye (Symptoms should remain mild):** The passage expresses *concern* about mild symptoms, not a suggestion that they *should* remain mild.
*   **C: Zyada logon ko sankramit karne ki jarurat hai (It is necessary to infect more people):**  The passage explicitly worries about *increased* infection rates.
*   **D: Bacchon mein lakshan dikhane chaiye (Symptoms should appear in children):** The passage mentions children being infected *without* being sick, not that symptoms *should* appear.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, toofan fujian se kitni door tha?","The correct answer is **C: 70 kilometers**.

The passage states: ""morakote ke aankh (kendra) chini praant fujianse lagbhag sattar kilometres door thi."" (The eye of the storm Morakot was approximately seventy kilometers away from the Chinese province Fujian.)

Therefore, the storm was 70 kilometers from Fujian.
"
George W. Bush ke asia aagman par unka swaagat kisne kiye tha?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng aur Lee Hsien Loong**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""unka singapur ke up-pradhan mantri wong kana sengne swaagat kiya aur unhone singapur ke pradhaanmantri liye sien lung ke saath vyapar aur aatankvaad ke mamle par baatchit ke."" 
* This translates to: ""He was welcomed by Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng and he discussed trade and terrorism issues with Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.""

Therefore, both Wong Kan Seng (Deputy Prime Minister) and Lee Hsien Loong (Prime Minister) welcomed George W. Bush.



"
Rashtrapati ne asia ke vyapar ke vistaar ke baare mein kab baat ki?,"The correct answer is **C: Apne madhyaavadhi chunaav haarne ke baad**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Madhyaavadhi chunaav mein ek hafte tak haarne ke baad, bushesne logon ko asia mein vyapar ke vistaar ke baare mein bataaya."" (After losing in the midterm elections for a week, Bushes told people about expanding trade in Asia.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Singapur aane par** - While he *was* in Singapore when talking about trade, the passage links the discussion to the election results, not simply his arrival.
*   **B: Wong Kan Seng ke sath** - He discussed trade *with* Wong Kan Seng, but the broader announcement to the public was after the election.
*   **D: Asia ke ek hafte ke daure ke baad** - The tour was happening *while* he was talking about trade, not after it. The timing is related to the election loss.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se sarkar ka lakshya kya hai?","The correct answer is **D: Gaadiyon mein bhidbhaad kam ho**.

Here's why:

The passage states the vehicles are being procured ""taakin bhidbhaadse nijaat mill sake"" - meaning ""so that congestion can be relieved"". This directly indicates the government's goal is to reduce congestion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Is saal march mein aur vaahanon ko vittiya madad de** - While the government *did* promise financial aid, that was a past action, not the current goal.
*   **B: Kul 300 gaadiyan mangwaye** - The passage states 300 *plus* existing vehicles make 1,300. 300 isn't the total.
*   **C: 1300 aur gaadiyan mangwaye** - The passage says 1,300 vehicles have been *acquired* (mangwai gayi hain), not that they are still being ordered.

Therefore, the passage focuses on the *purpose* of getting the vehicles, which is to alleviate congestion."
Sarkar ne kya ghoshna ki?,"The correct answer is **C: Ve 1300 aur gaadiyon ki vittiya madad ki yojna bana rahe hain**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""aaj ke is ghoshana ke saath hi, sarkar ka wah wada bhi pura hua. 300 aur gaaiyonse sankhya banati hain , 1,300 gaadiyan jo mangwai gayi hain ae taakin bhidbhaadse nijaat mill sake.""  This translates to ""With today's announcement, the government's promise has also been fulfilled. 300 more, making a total of 1,300 vehicles have been procured to alleviate congestion.""
* **Option C** accurately reflects this - the government is providing financial aid for 1300 vehicles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't say they *are planning* to create a financial aid scheme for 300 more vehicles; it states that *with the announcement* the previous promise for 1300 vehicles is fulfilled.
* **B:** While they *aim* to resolve the vehicle congestion, the announcement is specifically about financial aid for vehicles.
* **D:** The passage doesn't mention a timeline of resolving the congestion *by* March. It says the promise made *in* March is now fulfilled.



"
Is passage se kya jaankari milti hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Hamale ke ashanka hai**.

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Usane kahaa, """"is baat ko bataane waali koi gupta suchna nahin hai ki nikat bhavishya mein kisi hamale ke ashanka hai."""" - This translates to: ""He said, """"there is no secret information to indicate that an attack is expected in the near future.""""

Even though the passage says the *severity* of the threat has decreased, it explicitly states that the *possibility* of an attack still exists.  It clarifies that a reduced severity doesn't mean the threat is *gone*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Khatare ka star kam ho gaya hai (The level of danger has decreased):** While true according to the passage, it's not the primary information conveyed.
* **B: Khatra tall gaya hai (The danger has passed):**  The passage specifically says this is *not* true.
* **D: Gupta suchna ke mutabik hamla behad khatarnak hoga (According to secret information, the attack will be very dangerous):** The passage says there *is no* secret information indicating danger.



"
Virodh pradarshan ke mamle mein konsa kathan sahi nhin hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Presidential commission, virodhi pradarshanon ki pratikriya thi** (Presidential commission was a reaction to the protests).

Here's why:

The passage states the *commission recommended* a new CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections *in response to* the widespread protests. It doesn’t say the commission *was* a reaction to the protests, but rather that its recommendations were *made in response* to them. The commission was a consequence of the situation, not the immediate reaction itself.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **B: Samay se pehle hue chunnav ki wajah se virodh shuru hue** (Protests started because of prematurely held elections) - The passage states that violent opposition started after 2011 due to *occasional* elections being held.
*   **C: Virodh pradarshanon mein purv CEP ke tyagpatra ki maang ki gayi** (The protests demanded the resignation of the previous CEP) - The passage says the commission followed the *recommendation of the previous CEP's resignation*. This implies the protests also called for the resignation.
*   **D: Virodh kai baar hinsak roop le lete hain** (The protests sometimes turned violent) - The passage explicitly states ""2011 ke baadse, kabhi-kabhi chunaav karaane mein rahne ke vajah se hinsak virodh shuru ho gaya tha."" (After 2011, violent opposition sometimes started due to staying in election mode).



"
Poorv CEP ke poorv tyagpatra ka sujhav kisne diya?,"The correct answer is **C: Presidential commission**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""pichle mahine ek presidential commissionne desh ko naye chunaavon ke or badhane ke upaay ke pekage ke ek hisse ke roop mein cep ke poorv tyagpatra ke anushansa ke.""  This directly translates to ""Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Martelly** - While Martelly reacted *to* the protests and formed the CEP, he didn't suggest their predecessors resign.
*   **B: Pradarshankari (Protestors)** - The protestors demanded changes, but didn't specifically suggest the prior CEP members resign.
*   **D: Khud CEP ke sadasyon ne (The CEP members themselves)** - The text indicates an *external* recommendation for their resignation, not a self-initiated one.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Nassar ka atheletes ke sath durvyavhar karne ke baad se US gymnastics kis cheez ka samarthan nhin karta hai?","The correct answer is **A: Vipramanan (Retaliation)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""hum usoc ke is kathanse sahmat hain ki hamare athletes aur clubs aur unke khel, hamare sangathan ke bhitar saarthak badalaav ke saath aage bada kar behtar seva ke jaa sakti hai **naa ke vipramananse**."" This translates to ""We agree with the USOC's statement that our athletes and clubs and their sport can move forward with meaningful change within our organization to better serve them, **not with retaliation**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sashakt vatavaran banana (Creating a empowering environment):** The passage clearly states they support ""athletes ko surakshit, sakaratmak aur sashakt vatavaran mein apne sapanon ka anusaran karne ke liye..."" (athletes pursuing their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment).
*   **C: Sangathan mein jaruri badalaav (Necessary changes within the organization):** The passage supports ""saarthak badalaav ke saath aage bada"" (moving forward with meaningful change).
*   **D: Swatantra jaanch (Independent investigation):** The passage specifically states they support ""ek swatantra jaanch ka samarthan karta hai"" (supports an independent investigation).

Therefore, the only thing the passage indicates US Gymnastics *does not* support is retaliation.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, US gymnastics aur sanyukt rajya olympic samiti, dono ka mukhya lakshya kya hai?","The correct answer is **D: Atheletes ke liye sashakt vatavaran banana** (Creating a empowering environment for athletes).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""US Gymnastics aur USOC ka ek hi lakshya hai -- athletes ko surakshit, sakaratmak aur sashakt vatavaran mein apne sapanon ka anusaran karne ke liye gymnastics aur any logon ke khel ko jitna sambhav ho sake utna surakshit banana."" (US Gymnastics and USOC have the same goal – to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and empowering environment.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Larry nasser ke durvyavhar par prakash daalna** (To shed light on Larry Nasser's abuse) - While they *support* an investigation into this, it's not their *main* goal.
* **B: Vipramanan karna** (To oppose) - The passage states they want to move forward *with* change, not oppose it.
* **C: Swatantra jaanch karna** (To conduct an independent investigation) -  Again, they support this *as a means to an end*, but it's not the ultimate goal itself.



"
Ghatna ke dauran jahaaz kahan tha? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Avenger class mine countermazer ship, yah jahaaz **palwan ke pyarto princessa** ke raaste mein tha.""  This directly translates to ""Avenger class mine countermeasure ship, this ship was on the route of **Palawan** to Princessa.""

Therefore, the ship was located near Palawan during the incident.



"
Passage ke hisab se jahaaz ke baare mein konsi baat sahi nhin hai?,"The correct answer is **A: yah Puerto Princesa ke raste mein tha**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Avenger class mine countermazer ship, **yah jahaaz palwan ke pyarto princessa ke raaste mein tha.**"" 

Therefore, saying it *wasn't* on the route of Palawan and Puerto Princesa is incorrect, based on the provided text.  The passage *confirms* it was there.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

* **B: Yah Palawan mein hai** - The passage says it was ""palwan ke pyarto princessa ke raaste mein"" (on the route of Palawan and Puerto Princesa).
* **C: Yah mine countermazer ship hai** - The passage states: ""Avenger class **mine countermazer ship**...""
* **D: Ise U.S nevi ke saatven bede ko saunpa gaya tha** -  The passage says: ""Ise us nevi ke **saatven bede mein tainaat kar diya hai**..."" (It was deployed to the 7th Fleet).



"
America ki sena ke sambhand mein kisne bayaan diya tha?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

The text states: ""Ravivaar ko dair sham, **united states ke rashtrapati donald trumpne** press secretary ke riyein die bayaan mein bataaya ki us sena siriya ko chhonen vaali hai.""  (On Sunday evening, the President of the United States, **Donald Trump**, announced in a statement through the press secretary that the army is about to leave Syria.)

Therefore, Donald Trump is the one who gave the statement regarding the American army.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, bandi lasaakon ki suraksha ki zimmedari kis desh ne sambhali?","The correct answer is **D: Turke**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Turkene isis ke ladaakon ko pakadana aur nigrani karna shuru kar diya hai"" (Turkey has begun to capture and monitor ISIS fighters). This directly indicates that Turkey has taken on the responsibility for the custody of ISIS fighters.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Syria:** The passage states the US is *leaving* Syria, not taking responsibility for prisoners there.
*   **B: Europe:** The passage specifically says European countries *refused* to take them back.
*   **C: Sanyukt rajya america (United States of America):** The passage states the US is withdrawing, implying they are no longer responsible for the fighters.



"
Durghatna ka kya karan mana jaa raha hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Aapsi dushmani** (Mutual animosity).

The text states: ""Pahadi ilaakon mein zyada durghatna hui. **iski vajah aapsi dushmani ko maanaa jaataa hai.**"" (More accidents happened in the hilly areas. **The reason for this is believed to be mutual animosity.**)

While the other options (harsh terrain, hilly areas, and bad weather) are mentioned in the context of the situation, they are not stated as the *cause* of the accident. The text specifically identifies mutual animosity as the believed cause."
Durghatna kis tarah ke ilake mein hui?,"The correct answer is **D: Pahadi**.

The text explicitly states: ""Pahadi ilaakon mein zyada durghatna hui."" (More accidents happened in the hilly areas.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dushman (Enemy)** - While the text mentions ""aapsi dushmani"" (mutual animosity) as a *cause* of the accidents, it doesn't describe the *location* as being the enemy.
*   **B: Kathor (Harsh)** - The text says the area is ""kathor"" (harsh), but it also specifically mentions it's a ""pahadi"" (hilly) area.  The question asks for the *type* of area.
*   **C: Sanyukt sena (Joint army)** - The joint army is *operating* in the area, but it doesn't describe the area itself.



"
Baadh ki wajah se adhikari kya ummid kar rahe hain?,"The correct answer is **A: Sandars ki bahali (Restoration of sandbars)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Haalaanki, baadh ke baad paani ka astar sirf kuch hi feet badhega, lekin adhikari ummid kar rahe hain ki yah **nichale astar ke sandbars ko phir se bahal karne ke liye kafee hoga**.""  This directly translates to ""Although, after the flood, the water level will only rise a few feet, officials are hoping it will be enough to **restore the lower reach's sandbars**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Taton ka nirmaan (Construction of dunes):** The passage mentions dunes *were* necessary for wildlife, but doesn't say officials expect the flood to *create* them.
*   **C: Humpbek choob ki sankhya mein badhotri (Increase in the number of humpback chub):** The passage states the humpback chub is *endangered* due to the dam, not that its numbers will increase.
*   **D: Zyada wildlife habitants (More wildlife habitats):** While sandbar restoration could *eventually* lead to more habitats, the passage specifically states the hope is for sandbar restoration *first*.



"
Baandh ke nirmaan ke baad inme se kis par sthayi roop se asar hua?,"The correct answer is **B: Humpbek choob**.

Here's why:

*   The text specifically states that two fish species went extinct, and *another two became endangered, including the humpback chub*. This means the dam construction had a lasting, negative impact on the humpback chub population.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sandbars:** The text states the dam stopped sediment flow, *preventing* sandbar formation.  However, officials *hope* the increased water level will restore them – this implies the effect isn't permanent yet.
*   **C: Wildlife habitats:** While the dam altered wildlife habitats, the text details the specific impact on fish species. This is a more direct and permanent effect.
*   **D: Talachhat phail gaya (Spread of silt):** The dam *stopped* the spread of silt, it didn’t cause it.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, united states ko sambhavit hamlon ke baare mein kisne jaankari di?","The correct answer is **C: Agyaat srot** (Unknown source).

The passage explicitly states: ""America ka kahna hai ki use ek **agyaat srotse** jaankari mili hai..."" (America says it received information from an **unknown source**...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Somalia ke ativaadi** (Somali militants) - The passage says the militants are *planning* the attacks, not *providing* the warning.
*   **B: Ethiopia ke dutawas** (Ethiopian embassy) - The passage doesn't mention any information coming from the Ethiopian embassy.
*   **D: Kenya ka srot** (Kenyan source) - The passage doesn't mention any information coming from a Kenyan source.



"
Inme se konsa kathan ativaadi ke hamle ki yojana ka sahi vrnan karta hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Do deshon ke pramukh sthalon par bum visphot** (Bomb blasts at prominent locations in two countries).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the warning is about Somalia-based militants planning *suicide bomb attacks* in **both Kenya and Ethiopia** targeting **""prominent locations""**. 

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Desh ke pramukh sthalon par bum visphot** (Bomb blasts at prominent locations in *one* country) - The passage mentions two countries.
*   **B: Do deshon mein bum visphot** (Bomb blasts in two countries) - This is too vague; it doesn't specify *where* in those countries.
*   **D: Ak desh mein bum visphot** (Bomb blasts in *one* country) -  The passage clearly indicates two countries are targeted.

Inme se kon vakeel nhin hai?,"Sahi jawab hai: **D: Makis Triantafylopoulos**

Kyoki:

*   **Petros Mantouvalos** sansad ka sadasya aur vakeel hai.
*   **Sakis Kechagioglou** ek prasiddh Greek vakeel hai.
*   **George Nikolakopoulos** ek vakeel hai.
*   **Makis Triantafylopoulos** ek patrakar (journalist) hai, vakeel nahin. Ve apne television show ke madhyam se corruption ka ujagar karte hain.

"
Greek kanuni samudaay ke bhitar kis samuh ke logon ko ek badey ghotale ka hissa nhin btaya gaya hai?,"सही उत्तर है **C: Patrakar**

टेक्स्ट में स्पष्ट रूप से उल्लेख है कि पत्रकार माकिस ट्रिंटाफेलोपोस ने अपने शो के माध्यम से जानकारी प्रकाशित की जिससे घोटाला उजागर हुआ। उन्हें घोटाले का हिस्सा नहीं बताया गया है, बल्कि उन्होंने इसे उजागर करने में भूमिका निभाई है। 

अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि:

*   **Solicitors:** टेक्स्ट में उल्लेख है कि solicitors भी भ्रष्टाचार में शामिल थे।
*   **Nyayadhishon:** टेक्स्ट में स्पष्ट रूप से उल्लेख है कि न्यायाधीश भ्रष्टाचार में शामिल थे।
*   **Vakeelon:** टेक्स्ट में उल्लेख है कि वकील भ्रष्टाचार में शामिल थे।

इसलिए, सही उत्तर **C: Patrakar** है।"
India ne kitne wicket ganvaane?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The passage states: ""कप्तान का विकेट ganvaane ke baad bharatne paari samaapti tak **7 wicket** khokar kewal 36 rann hi banaae."" (After losing the captain's wicket, India lost only 36 runs by losing **7 wickets** till the end of the innings)."
"Passage ke hisab se, Paari mein sabse zyada score kya tha?","The correct answer is **A: 70 rann**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Robin uthappane kewal 41 gendon mein 11 chaukon aur 2 chhakkon ke madadse **70 rann** banaa kar paari ka sarvochch score banaaya."" (Robin Uthappa scored the highest score of the innings by making **70 runs** in just 41 balls with 11 fours and 2 sixes.)"
Inme se konsa Addam Kardenne ki nirasha ka karan nhin hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Youn saamagree ke liye site ki nayi neeti**.

Here's why:

The passage states Addam Kardenne was frustrated because:

* **Wells lied from the start.** He initially claimed the calla removal was for legal reasons, which Kardenne believed was a falsehood. (This corresponds to option D)
* **Wells pretended to listen to their concerns** while delaying the calla removal. (This corresponds to option C)
* **Wells removed the calla.** (This corresponds to option B)

The passage mentions a new policy is being *drafted* in response to community anger, but it doesn't state that Kardenne is *frustrated by the policy itself*, only by Wells' actions leading up to the need for the policy.  The policy is a consequence of the issues, not a cause of Kardenne's frustration.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, site se kya hataya gaya?","The correct answer is **A: Calla**.

The passage states: ""doosra, apni calla ko hataane ke samay tak yah jataate hue ki wah hamari baat soon rahaa tha."" (Secondly, while removing his calla, he pretended to be listening to us.)

This clearly indicates that ""calla"" was removed from the site. The other options are not mentioned as being removed in the passage.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Amir Khan inme se kiska samarthan nhin karte hain?","The correct answer is **A: Olympic mein mhilaaon fighters (Women fighters in the Olympics)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Amir Khan said, """"mujhe dilse lagata hai ki mahilaaon ko ladaai nahin karni chaahiye. Aisi merry rae hai"""" - which translates to ""I sincerely believe that women should not fight. It's a silly idea.""  This clearly indicates he doesn't support women participating as fighters in the Olympics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: British pratispardhiyon (British competitors):** He *explicitly* states he will support British competitors in the 2012 Olympics.
*   **C: Mahilaaon ke vichar (Women's thoughts):** While he disagrees with the idea of women fighting, the passage doesn't say he doesn't respect their opinions generally.
*   **D: London mein ayojit olympics (Olympics held in London):** He supports the Olympics being held in London, and will support the British competitors competing there.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Amir Khan apni vyakitgat rayee ke baad inme se kiska samarthan karenge?","The correct answer is **C: 2012 Olympics**.

Here's why:

The passage states that despite his personal opinion (""mujhe dilse lagata hai ki mahilaaon ko ladaai nahin karni chaahiye. Aisi merry rae hai""), Amir Khan will support British competitors in the 2012 Olympics in London.  He's supporting the *event* (2012 Olympics) and its competitors, not specifically female fighters or anyone else mentioned in the options.



"
Peter Lenz ki mrityu kab hui?,"The correct answer is **C: Aspatal mein** (In the hospital).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...uski mrityu ho gayi thi."" (he died) and before that it says ""...ek sthaaniya aspatal mein le jaya gaya jahan baad meinuski mrityu ho gayi thi."" (he was taken to a local hospital where he later died). 

While he was initially injured when he fell off his bike and hit by another racer, he ultimately died in the hospital.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Warm up ke dauran** (During warm-up) - The passage doesn't specify *when* during warm-up it happened, just that he was riding fast.
*   **B: Bike se girane ke baad** (After falling off the bike) - He was injured after falling, but didn't die immediately.
*   **D: Onn-trek medical staff ke sath** (With the on-track medical staff) - They provided initial treatment, but he died in the hospital."
Xavier Zayat kon hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Dusra racer** (Another racer).

The passage states ""saathi racer zavier zyaat dwara maaraa gaya tha"" (was hit by fellow racer Xavier Zayat). This clearly identifies Xavier Zayat as another racer involved in the incident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Onn-trek medical staff:** The passage says medical staff *treated* Peter Lenz, they weren't Xavier Zayat.
* **C: Doctor:** The passage doesn't state Xavier Zayat is a doctor.
* **D: Fan:** The passage indicates Xavier Zayat was a participant in the race, not a spectator.



"
"Kis sthithi mein ak ghabraye hue yatri ko vimaan ke kam karne ke tareeke aur udan ke dauran kya hota hai, is baare mein samjhane se phayda ho sakta hai?","The correct answer is **B: Udaan ke aise darr ko door karne mein jo agyaat hai**.

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states: ""kuch ke liye, vimaan ke kam karne ke tareeke aur udan ke dauran kya hota hai, is baare mein samajhna ek aise darr ko door karne mein madad kar sakta hai jo agyaat yaa niyantran mein naan hone par aadhaarit hai.""  This directly translates to ""for some, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help overcome a fear based on the unknown or lack of control.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Agar yatri ko apne darr par sharam aati hai:** While the passage acknowledges that people *might* feel ashamed, understanding the mechanics of flight isn't about addressing the shame itself, but the fear.
* **C: Agar yatri ko sabhi tarah ke vaahan se dar lagta ho:** The passage specifically focuses on fear of *flying* (vimaan mein yatra), not a general fear of all vehicles.
* **D: Agar unhe yatra ke dauran kisi dardnak ghatna ka saamana karna padaa ho:** The passage mentions past traumatic events as a possible cause of fear, but understanding airplane mechanics is presented as a solution for fear stemming from the *unknown*, not necessarily trauma.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Keemat ke prati jaagrook yatri ko inme se kya karna chaiye?","The correct answer is **C: Kai travel companies se price ki tulna karni chaiye** (You should compare prices from multiple travel companies).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that different aggregators can show different prices for the same flight and that it's beneficial to *compare* search results.  While checking the airline's website directly (D) is also mentioned as beneficial, the primary advice is price comparison.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kai travel companiyon par offers dekhne chaiye** (You should look at offers from multiple travel companies) - This is too broad. The passage emphasizes *comparing prices* specifically, not just looking at offers.
*   **B: Seedhe airline se book karni chaiye** (You should book directly with the airline) - While the passage suggests checking the airline's website, it doesn't say you *should* always book directly. It's part of the comparison process.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Yatri ko flight ka sabse accha offer dekhne ke liye kya karna chaiye?","The correct answer is **B: Alag-alag aggregators par keemat ki tulna karni chaiye** (Compare prices on different aggregators).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kabhi-kabhi vibhin aggregators par ek hi flight ke alag-alag moolya ho sakte hain aur khoj parinamon ke tulna karna aur bookingse pehle airline ke swayam ke website bhi dekhna laabhdaayak hota hai."" 

This means prices can vary across different aggregators, and it's *beneficial* to compare search results. While checking the airline's website directly is also mentioned, the primary advice is comparing across aggregators.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Airline ki website dekhni chaiye** (Should check the airline's website) -  The passage says checking the airline's website is *also* beneficial, but not the primary step.
*   **C: Seedhe airline se book karni chaiye** (Should book directly with the airline) - The passage doesn't advocate for booking directly, only for checking prices there.
*   **D: Seedhe travel agent se book karani chaiye** (Should book with a travel agent) - The passage doesn't mention travel agents at all.



"
Delivery ke liye ak sathi ki jarurat kab padti hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Jab air fret ke zariye chizon ko bheja jata hai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yadi way air fret ke zariye chizon ko bhejate hain, toh kuch roots par unloading karne aur custom ke liye kuch din lug sakte hain. Ise teense praapt karne ka ekmatra tarika ise check kiye gaye saamaan ke roop mein bhejana tha."" This directly means a companion (or someone to assist) is needed when sending things via air freight, because it takes days to unload and clear customs, and the only way to expedite it is to send it as checked baggage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jab companiyan khud ke vimaan se chizon ko bhejati hain:** The passage states larger companies *have* their own planes, but doesn't mention needing a companion when using them.
*   **C: Jab chizon ko check kiye gaye saamaan ke roop mein bheja jata hai:** Sending as checked baggage *is* the solution to the problem, but it's not *when* a companion is needed – it's *how* to make the delivery faster when using air freight.
*   **D: Jab delivery ak badi company kar rahi ho:** The passage discusses big companies having their own planes, but doesn't say a companion is needed specifically *when* a large company is delivering.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, kisi sandhi mein baar baar udaan ke liye airline chunte samay, apko inme se kise prathmikata deni chaiye?","The correct answer is **D: Wah airline jo atirikt phayde dete ho (The airline that offers additional benefits)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""airline mein dee jaane waali khaas suvidhaaen aksar alag-alag hoti hain"" (special facilities offered by airlines are often different). It then suggests that frequent travelers who fly different airlines in the same region will have more informed opinions *because* of these varying facilities.  This means the primary consideration should be the extra benefits offered, not just familiarity or size.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jo airline sabse zyada suvidha de (The airline that offers the most convenience):** While convenience is important, the passage focuses on *specific benefits*, not just overall convenience.
* **B: Sabse badi sandhi mein airline (The airline in the largest network):** The passage doesn't mention network size as a key factor.
* **C: Jis airline se aap aksar yatra karte hain (The airline you travel with most often):** The passage actually *cautions* against automatically choosing the airline you're used to, emphasizing the need to consider available benefits.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, kon baar baar sabse zyada suvidha de sakta hai?","Correct answer is **D: Ek hi sandhi mein alag alag airline**.

Here's why:

The passage states that frequent travelers who fly *different airlines within the same region* will have more informed opinions about which airline offers the best amenities. This is because amenities vary between airlines.  

* **Option A** talks about different regions, which isn't the focus of the passage.
* **Option B** suggests sticking with your most frequent airline, which the passage argues *against* - it says you should consider options.
* **Option C** talks about different regions again.
* **Option D** directly reflects the passage's advice: look at multiple airlines *within the same region* to find the best services.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, atyadhik sharab pine se inme se konsi indriyaan kharab ho sakti hain?","The correct answer is **B: Dekhana (Seeing)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Atyadhik sharab pinese sambhaavit deerghakalik swaasthya ghatnaaon mein leaver ke kshati aur yahaan tak ki **andhaapan** aur mrityu bhi ho sakti hai."" 

""Andhaapan"" means blindness, which directly relates to the sense of sight (seeing). The passage doesn't mention any negative effects on hearing, taste, or smell."
"Passage ke hisab se, sharab ke haanikarak prabhav ko sambhavit roop se kaise kam kiya jaa sakta hai?","The correct answer is **C: Kam sharab peena** (Drinking less alcohol).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Atyadhik sharab pinese sambhaavit deerghakalik swaasthya ghatnaaon mein leaver ke kshati aur yahaan tak ki andhaapan aur mrityu bhi ho sakti hai."" (Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to long-term health events, including liver damage, and even blindness and death).  It also stresses knowing your limits. Therefore, drinking less is the way to reduce the harmful effects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Methanol ke sath sharab peena** (Drinking alcohol with methanol) - The passage *warns against* this, saying it can cause blindness or death.
*   **B: Avaidh roop se banayi sharab peena** (Drinking illegally made alcohol) - The passage also *warns against* this, stating it contains dangerous impurities.
*   **D: Alag alag logon ke sath sharab peena** (Drinking alcohol with different people) - The passage doesn't mention this as a factor in the harm caused by alcohol. It focuses on *how much* you drink.



"
Amsterdam mein sampatti ka moolya sabse zyada kahan hain?,"The correct answer is **A: Canal District**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...iski sampatti ka moolya desh ke sarvocch moolyon mein se ek hai"" (its property value is among the highest in the country) *in reference to* the Canal District (gratchengordale). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: UNESCO World Heritage Site ke roop mein naamit koi bhi jagah:** While the Canal District *is* a UNESCO site, the passage specifies the high property value is specifically within the Canal District.
* **C: Binnenstead se hatayi gayi jagah:** The passage refers to ""binnenstead"" as part of the Canal District, not a place from which property is removed.
* **D: Aitihaasik mahatav wali jagah:**  Historical importance is mentioned, but it's the Canal District that has the highest property value.



"
Canal district ko UNESCO World Heritage Site ke roop mein kyun naamit kiya gaya hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Saanskritik aur aitihaasik moolya** (Cultural and historical value).

The passage explicitly states the Canal District was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site *because* of its ""adbhut saanskritik aur aitihaasik moolya"" (wonderful cultural and historical value).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Anokhi jagah** (Unique location) - While it *is* a unique place, the passage doesn't state this as the *reason* for the UNESCO designation.
* **C: Ye Binnenstad ke aas pass hai** (It is near Binnenstad) -  Its location near Binnenstad is a fact, but not the reason it's a UNESCO site.
* **D: Sampatti ka moolya sabse zyada hai** (Property value is the highest) - The passage mentions its high property value, but that isn't the reason for the UNESCO designation; the cultural and historical value is.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kya chiz Fnome chrome ki yatra ko sarthak banati hai?","The correct answer is **A: Tonle Sap par nazare (Views of Tonle Sap)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mandir ka suunaa vatavaran aur **toneley sap jhil ke oopar ka drishya** pahadi ke chadhaai ko saarthak banaata hai."" This directly translates to ""The serene atmosphere and **view of Tonle Sap lake** makes the climb worthwhile.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Angkor Pass ke zariye yatra (Travel with Angkor Pass):** While the passage mentions needing an Angkor Pass to enter, it doesn't say the pass *makes* the trip worthwhile, just that it's *required*.
*   **C: Siam reap dekhana (Seeing Siam Reap):**  The passage states Phnom Krom is *near* Siem Reap, but doesn't link seeing Siem Reap to the worth of the Phnom Krom trip.
*   **D: Jhil tak boat trip (Boat trip to the lake):** The passage says the trip to the site can be *combined* with a trip to the lake, but doesn't say the boat trip itself makes the Phnom Krom trip worthwhile.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, yatri ko Fnome chrome mein pravesh karne ke liye kis chiz ki zaroorat padati hai?","The correct answer is **C: Angkor Pass lena**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Jab aap toneley sape ke or bada rahe hone, toh apne saath passport laana naa bhoolen kyonki mandir mein pravesh ke liye angkor paas ke zaroorat padati hai."" (When you are heading towards Tonle Sap, don't forget to bring your passport because you need an Angkor Pass to enter the temple).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yasovarman madir ke peeche chadana** - The passage mentions Yasovarman as the king who built the temple, but doesn't say anything about climbing behind it.
* **B: Siam reap ke aas pass ghumana** - While Fnome Chrome is near Siem Reap, simply being in the area isn't enough to enter the temple.
* **D: Tonle Sap mein boating** -  The passage mentions Tonle Sap, but boating on it isn't a requirement for entering Fnome Chrome.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kya chiz paryatak ko Antarctica jaane se rok sakti hai?","The correct answer is **D: Shaaririk fitness ki kami**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Paryatakon ka dora mahanga hai aur **shaaririk fitness ke maang** kewal garmiyon mein novemberse farwari tak ho sakti hai..."" This directly translates to ""Tourism is expensive and **physical fitness is required** only during the summer months from November to February...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vyaapak yatra bajat (Extensive travel budget):** While the passage mentions tourism is expensive, it doesn't say it *prevents* tourists. It's a factor, but not a barrier mentioned as a requirement.
*   **B: Ross saagar ghumne ki ruchi (Interest in visiting the Ross Sea):** The passage doesn't suggest interest in a specific area prevents tourism.
*   **C: Kaam ka schedule, jiski wajah se sirf December aur January mein ghum sakte hain (Work schedule, due to which you can only travel in December and January):** The passage states tourism is possible from November to February, not just December and January. It doesn't link this to work schedules.



"
Parvataarohan mein ruchi rakhane wale payatak Antarctica ke kis hisse ki yatra kar sakte hain?,"The correct answer is **B: Antardeshiya ilaka (Interior region)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Parvataarohan ke liye yaa dhruv tak pahunchane ke liye kabhi-kabhi visheshagya antardeshiya hawai yatra karte hain, jiska ek bada aadhar hai.""  This directly links mountain climbing (parvataarohan) to travel in the *interior region* (antardeshiya ilaka) of Antarctica.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ross sagar (Ross Sea):** The passage mentions tourism is *limited to* the islands, archipelagos and Ross Sea, but doesn't say mountain climbing happens *in* the Ross Sea.
*   **C: Updweep (Archipelagos):**  Tourism is limited to these areas, but again, the passage specifically connects mountain climbing to the interior.
*   **D: Dweep (Islands):** Same reasoning as archipelagos – tourism happens here, but mountain climbing is linked to the interior.



"
Aadhunik callse pehle ke vedhashaalaa kahan hone ki sabse kam sambhavana hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Dooradraj ke kshetra (Remote areas)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ancient observatories are *generally* located in cities or surrounding areas because light pollution wasn't an issue back then. It *also* states that modern research telescopes are equipped to operate in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions. This implies that ancient observatories would *not* typically be found in remote areas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aasani se paunchane wali jagah (Easily accessible locations):** The passage supports this – ancient observatories were easier to reach than modern ones.
*   **B: Shahar ke beech (City center):** The passage states ancient observatories were commonly located in or near cities.
*   **D: College parisar (College campus):** The passage mentions they are *now* often kept as museums or educational institutions (like on college campuses), but not that they were originally *built* there.



"
Aadhunik anusandhaan doorbeenon kahan rakhe jane ki sambhavna hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Ek badi suvidhaa (A large facility)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Adhikansh aadhunik anusandhaan doorbeenon mein anukool vayumandaliya pariisthitiyon ke saath dooradraj ke kshetron mein kam karne ke liye bahut suvidhaaen hain.""  This translates to: ""Most modern research telescopes have many facilities to operate in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.""

This indicates modern telescopes are located in dedicated, purpose-built facilities in remote locations, not museums (sangrahalay), university campuses (vishvavidyaalay parisar), or general educational institutions (shaikshanik asthan).
"
"Passage ke hisab se, shant samudri tat ke liye konsi Jaga sabse accha hai?","The correct answer is **C: Uttar harbour zile**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Uttari samudri tat, (uttar harbour zile mein) prashant mahasagar mein hain aur yah uttar mein long bays e lekar dakshin mein devenport tak phaila hua hai. ye zyaadaatar reit ke tat hain jahaan tairna surakshit maanaa jaataa hai."" 

This directly translates to: ""The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south. These are mostly sandy beaches where swimming is considered safe.""

The passage specifically highlights the North Harbour district as having *shant* (peaceful/calm) beaches where swimming is safe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: St Heliers & B: Mission Bay:** These are described as being on the Waitemata Harbour and sometimes crowded.
*   **D: Waitemata Harbor:** This is a location *of* beaches, not a specific beach known for being calm.



"
"Passage ke hisaba, kis jaha tairna surakshit maanaa jaataa hai?","The correct answer is **B: Uttar harbour zile** (North Harbour district).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Uttari samudri tat, (uttar harbour zile mein) prashant mahasagar mein hain aur yah uttar mein long bays e lekar dakshin mein devenport tak phaila hua hai. ye zyaadaatar reit ke tat hain jahaan **tairna surakshit maanaa jaataa hai**.""

This directly says swimming is considered safe on the North Harbour district beaches.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Devonport** - While Devonport is *part* of the North Harbour beaches mentioned, the passage says swimming is safe *throughout* that district, not just Devonport.
*   **C: Central Auckland** - The passage says swimming is safe on the Tamaki Drive beaches in Central Auckland, but it doesn't make that the primary focus.
*   **D: Long Bay** - Long Bay is *within* the North Harbour district beaches, but again, the passage refers to the entire district being safe for swimming.



"
Passage mein btayi gayi jagah par jate samay inme se kise sahi nhin mana jata hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Majak banana** (Making jokes).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**holocaust yaa naazi logon ke baare mein mazaak naan karein.**"" (Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis). This makes making jokes the one thing specifically forbidden by the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vyavhaar mein gambhirta** (Seriousness in behavior) - The passage *requests* seriousness.
*   **B: Jagah ke aas paas koi kuch banaana** (Making something around the place) - The passage forbids damaging the place by building or scratching.
*   **D: Chizon ko kharonchna** (Scratching things) - The passage specifically says not to damage the place by scratching.



"
Inme se konsa Samanya bhashaon ka varnan karta hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Praakritik**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Way samanya bhashase alag hain, jo any bhasha bolane vaalon ke beach sanchaar ke saadhan ke roop mein **praakritik yaa jaivik bhaashaaen** hain...""  This directly translates to ""These are different from common languages, which are **natural or organic languages** used as a means of communication between speakers of other languages...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Artificial** - The passage specifically contrasts artificial languages *with* common languages.
* **B: Unnatural** - While common languages aren't 'artificial', describing them as 'unnatural' isn't how the passage frames it.
* **C: Banaai gayi** - This translates to ""made"", which describes artificial languages, not common languages.



"
Inme se konsa kathan sahayak bhaasha ka sahi varnan karta hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Ye kathin sanchaar paridrshyon ko behatar banaane ke lie banaee gaee bhaashaen hain** (These are languages created to improve difficult communication scenarios).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""Inhen taiyar karne ka maksad aise logon ko baatchit karne ke suvidha denaa hai jo inke naa hone par aasaanise baatchit nahin kar paayenge."" (They are created with the purpose of facilitating communication for people who would not be able to communicate easily without them.) This directly aligns with option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage states *artificial* languages are created, not *organic* (jaivik) ones.
* **B:** The passage distinguishes between artificial and natural languages; they are not both.
* **D:** While auxiliary languages *facilitate* communication between speakers of different languages, the passage emphasizes the purpose is to help those who *cannot* communicate easily otherwise, not just those speaking different languages. It's about overcoming a communication barrier, not simply translation.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, sardiyon mein jahaz mein jaate samay kya dekhna chaiya?","Correct answer: **A: cabin ka sthan**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Agar aap sardiyon mein uttari batlik ko paar karte hain, toh aapko **cabin asthan ke jaanch karni hogi**..."" (If you cross the North Atlantic in winter, you must **check the location of the cabin**...)

The passage directly highlights the need to check the cabin's location when travelling in winter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: visa aavashyakta (visa requirements):** The passage mentions exemptions from ""veean aavashyaktaon"" (visa requirements) but doesn't say you *need* to check them. It says requirements are *waived* for potvihar passengers.
* **C: Shartein (conditions):** While the passage refers to ""sharton ko jaanchen"" (checking conditions) it's about exemptions *from* conditions for potvihar passengers, not a condition you need to check for yourself.
* **D: Shahar mein bitaya gaya samay (time spent in the city):** The passage mentions spending time in the city at Cent Pietersberg potvihar, but doesn't suggest you need to check this before travelling.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, agar kisi yatri ki yatra garmiyon mein hai, to kya ve ise taal sakte hain?","The correct answer is **C: Visa aavashyakta**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""potvihar yaatriyon ko veean aavashyaktaon (sharton ko jaanchen)se chhoot dee gayi hai."" This means travellers on the Potvihar trip are exempt from visa requirements.
* **The question asks:** If a traveller is travelling in summer, can they postpone the trip?  The passage *only* mentions visa exemptions for Potvihar trips. There's no indication that summer travel would change visa requirements.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shahar mein samay (Time in the city):** The passage mentions spending time in the city but doesn't relate it to postponing a trip.
* **B: Barf se gujarana (Travelling through snow):** This is a condition for *winter* travel, not a reason to postpone.
* **D: Saint Petersburg:** Saint Petersburg is a location mentioned, but it doesn't relate to the question of postponing a summer trip.

Therefore, the only relevant information is the visa exemption, making **C** the correct answer.

Barcelona mein sanketon aur ghoshanaon ke liye aksar catalan ke istemal kyun kiya jata hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Yah is sahar ki aadhikarik bhaasha hai** (It is the city's official language).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...zyaadaatar sanket sirf catalan mein hi ingit kiye jaate hain, **kyonki yah kanunan vahan ke pahali aadhikarik bhasha hai**."" (most signs are indicated only in Catalan, **because it is legally the first official language there**).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yah Spanish ki tulna mein vyaapak roop se istemal ke jaati hai** (It is used more widely than Spanish) - While it's mentioned Catalan is preferred by about half the population, the reason for the signs isn't just widespread use, it's *official* status.
*   **C: Yah bhasha Barcelona mein jada pasand ki jati hai** (This language is more liked in Barcelona) - Preference is a factor, but not the primary reason for official signage.
*   **D: Metro aur anya saarvajanik jagahon par zyadatar Catalan bolne wale log aate hain** (Most Catalan speakers come to the metro and other public places) - This isn't mentioned in the passage and is an assumption.



"
Barcelona ki metro mein niyamit ghoshanaaen inme se kis bhasha mein hoti hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Catalan**.

The passage clearly states: ""Metro mein niyamit ghoshanaaen kewal catalan mein ke jaati hain."" (Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan).

While other languages are used for automated disruption announcements, the *regular* announcements are specifically in Catalan."
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kis suvidha ko luxury bistar aur nashte ko prathmikta diye jane ki sambhavna nhin hai?","The correct answer is **D: Tez speed wala wifi**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the *luxury* and *traditional* aspects of B&Bs in developed countries. It highlights:

*   **Luxurious beds:** High-quality bedding, handmade quilts.
*   **Local and unique breakfasts:** Seasonal produce, host's specialties.
*   **Atmospheric settings:** Historic buildings, antique furniture, manicured grounds, swimming pools.

While modern conveniences like Wi-Fi are *nice to have*, they aren't mentioned as a key component of the luxury experience described in the passage. The emphasis is on indulgence, local flavor, and historical charm – things that Wi-Fi doesn't directly contribute to.

Let's look at why the other options are likely to be prioritized:

*   **A: Vishesh menu item (Special menu items):** The passage specifically mentions ""mezban ke khaas vyanjan"" (host's special dishes).
*   **B: Ankoha antic saman (Antique furniture):** The passage explicitly states the setting might have ""antic saman"" (antique furniture).
*   **C: Acchi tarah se banaya gaya bahar ka area (Well-maintained outdoor area):**  The passage refers to ""manikare maidan"" (manicured grounds) and swimming pools.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se konsi chiz luxury B&Bs ke beech pratispardha ke liye jaruri nhin hai?","The correct answer is **A: Adhunik sajavat (Modern decoration)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that luxury B&Bs compete primarily on **beds and breakfast**. It then details what makes them luxurious:

*   **Beds:** ""sabse adhik vilasi bistar, aur sambhavatah haath ka banaa kambal yaa ainteek baid"" (most luxurious beds, and possibly handmade blankets or antique quilts)
*   **Breakfast:** ""kshetra ke mausami rush yaa mezban ke khaas vyanjan"" (local seasonal produce or the host's specialty dishes)
*   **Setting:** ""antic saman, manikare maidan aur swimming pool waali koi purani aitihaasik imarat"" (antique furniture, manicured grounds and a swimming pool in an old historical building).

The passage focuses on *antique* settings and luxurious comfort, implying a more traditional aesthetic. **Modern decoration** isn't mentioned as a key competitive factor. 

Options B, C, and D are all directly linked to elements described as important for luxury B&Bs in the passage:

*   **B: Mausami nashte ke offer (Offering seasonal breakfasts)** - explicitly mentioned.
*   **C: Mahenge bistar (Expensive beds)** - linked to ""vilasi bistar"" (luxurious beds).
*   **D: Sthaniya khana peena (Local food and drink)** - this is encompassed within ""kshetra ke mausami rush"" (local seasonal produce)."
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kya 2022 mein beijing mein Ayojit nhin kiya jayega?","The correct answer is **B: Taizicheng ski kshetra mein spardha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Any skiing programs will be in Zhangjiakou in the Taizicheng ski area, approximately 220 kilometers (140 miles) from Beijing."" This means skiing events will *not* be held in Beijing itself, but in a nearby city.

The passage also confirms that Beijing *will* host:

*   **A: Udghaatan samaroh (Opening Ceremony)**
*   **C: Samaapan samaroh (Closing Ceremony)**
*   **D: Indor barf ke spardha (Indoor ice competitions)**"
"Passage ke hisab se, 2022 mein beijing mein inme se kiski mezbani ki jayegi?","The correct answer is **B: Indor barf ke spardha (Indoor ice competitions)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Beijing udghaatan aur samaapan samaroh aur indor barf ke spardhaon ke mejbani karega."" (Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies and indoor ice competitions).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Grishmakaleen olympic (Summer Olympics):** The passage states Beijing will be the first city to host *both* summer and winter Olympics, but this question asks what will be hosted *in 2022*, which is the Winter Olympics.
*   **C: Shitkaleen olympic (Winter Olympics):** While Beijing *is* hosting the Winter Olympics, the passage doesn’t say Beijing will host *all* the Winter Olympics events, only some (indoor ice competitions and ceremonies).
*   **D: Samaapan samaroh (Closing Ceremony):** The passage mentions Beijing hosting the closing ceremony, but it also mentions hosting indoor ice competitions, making option B a more comprehensive answer of what Beijing will host.



"
Avian influenza se sankramit hone ka sabse zayda jokhim kise hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Pakshi paalan wale (Bird keepers)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Adhikansh log murgi paalan karte hain, lekin pakshi paalan mein kuch jokhim bhi hai"" (Most people raise chickens, but there is some risk in bird keeping).  It directly links bird keeping (pakshi paalan) with risk, even mentioning chickens (murgi paalan) as more common but still having risk.  Since avian influenza affects birds, those directly involved in their care – bird keepers – are at the highest risk of exposure.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Standhaariyon ke sath kaam karne wale (Those who work with livestock):** While the passage mentions the flu can affect livestock, it doesn't specifically highlight them as *most* at risk.
* **C: murgi paalan karne wale (Chicken farmers):** While chicken farmers *are* at risk, the passage specifically notes a risk with *all* bird keeping, making 'bird keepers' a broader and more accurate answer.
* **D: Jo pehle bhi sankramit ho chuka hai (Those who have been infected before):** Previous infection doesn't necessarily mean higher current risk; it might even offer some immunity (although the passage doesn't discuss this).



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se konsa kathan bird flu ka sahi varnan karta hai?","The correct answer is **C: Pakshi paalan ka kaam karne wale logon ke liye sabse zayda jokhim hai** (Those who work in poultry farming are at the highest risk).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Adhikansh log murgi paalan karte hain, lekin pakshi paalan mein kuch jokhim bhi hai."" (Most people raise chickens, but there is some risk in poultry farming as well.)  This indicates a higher risk for those involved in raising birds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sirf murgi paalan ka kaam karne walon ko flu hua hai** (Only those who work in chicken farming have contracted the flu) - The passage states it can infect birds *and* mammals, and humans have had cases, not just chicken farmers.
* **B: Pakshiyon ke mukable insanon ke zyada case samne aaye hain** (More cases have been reported in humans than in birds) - The passage doesn't compare the number of cases in birds vs. humans.
* **D: Insanon mein samane aaye sabhi mamle ghatak rahe hain** (All cases in humans have been fatal) - The passage specifically says ""unamense kuch ghaatak rahe hain"" (some have been fatal), not all.



"
White see-baltic nahar kise jodati hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Arctic mahasagar aur baltic sagar**.

The text explicitly states: ""White see-baltic nahar arctic mahasagar ko jyaadaatar nadiyon aur jhilon dwara baltic sagarse jodati hai..."" (The White Sea-Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean to the Baltic Sea mostly through rivers and lakes...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kala sagar aur caspian sagar** - The text mentions Vikings used routes to these seas, but the canal doesn't directly connect them.
* **B: Jhil onega aur nadi volga** - While the text mentions these are connected, it's not the *primary* connection the canal provides.
* **D: Dakshinee mahasagar aur laal sagar** - These are not mentioned in the text at all.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, kis tarah ke vaahan par passport ekatra kiya ja sakte hai, taki yatri ko koi pareshani na ho?","The correct answer is **B: Night sleeper trains**.

The passage specifically states: ""Night sleeper trains par, conductor dwara passport ekatra kiya jaa sakta hai taaki aapko apni neend mein bada naa aye."" (On night sleeper trains, the conductor may collect passports so you are not disturbed in your sleep.)

The other options are mentioned in the passage, but not in relation to passport collection for convenience."
"Passage ke hisab se, kuch cross-border trains mein apke ID ka nireekshan kab kiya ja sakta hai?","The correct answer is **D: Chalti train mein**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""kuch cross-border trains mein nireekshan chalati hui train mein kiya jaataa hai..."" which translates to ""in some cross-border trains, inspection is done while the train is running.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Train se utarne ke baad** - The passage states immigration checkpoints are *typically* the first step *when disembarking* (getting off) a vehicle. This doesn't apply to inspections *on* cross-border trains.
*   **B: Aape sone ke dauran** - While the passage mentions passports being collected on night sleeper trains *while you sleep*, this isn't about general ID checks, it's a specific procedure for passport collection.
*   **C: nireekshan nhin kiya jata** - The passage clearly states that inspections *do* happen on some cross-border trains.



"
Singapur ke atyadhik ushnakatibandh kshetra mein rehane ke dauran inme se konsi samasya hone ki zyada sambhavna hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Garmi se thakavat**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states: ""...atyadhik ushnakatibandh mein hone ke vajah se, aapko garmi (hamesha) aur tez dhoop (jab aasmaan saaf ho, jo ki zyaadaatar hota hai) ka saamana karna padegaa.""  This directly points to heat being a constant issue and the likelihood of heat exhaustion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Thage jana (Being robbed):** The passage mentions Singapur being a safe place.
* **B: Aasani se dukanon tak na paunch pana (Difficulty reaching shops):** The passage states you can easily navigate and buy almost anything.
* **D: Raste bhatak jana (Getting lost):** The passage states you can easily navigate.



"
German pastries kon nhin khana chahega?,"The correct answer is **A: Jise giri se gambhir allergy hai (Someone with a severe nut allergy)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""kayee german beked saamanon mein badam, akhrot aur dusre pedon ke giri shamil hain"" (Many German baked goods include almonds, walnuts and other nuts).  Therefore, someone with a nut allergy would want to avoid these pastries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jise zyada tasty mithaiyan pasand hain (Someone who likes very tasty sweets):** The text describes the pastries as good and popular, implying they *are* tasty.
*   **C: Jise choclate pasand nhin (Someone who doesn't like chocolate):** The text doesn't mention chocolate.
*   **D: Jise namkeen ke mukable meetha pasand hai (Someone who prefers sweet over savory):** The text focuses on sweet pastries, so this person would likely *enjoy* them.



"
German pastry mein konsi chiz mausam ke hisab se istemal hoti hai?,"Correct answer is **C: Plum**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Fruit pastry aam hain, jismein poore saal seb ko pakakar pastry banaai jaati hain, aur cherry aur plum garmiyon ke dauran dikhai dete hain."" (Fruit pastries are common, with apples being baked into pastries throughout the year, and cherries and plums appearing during the summer.)

Therefore, plums are specifically mentioned as being used seasonally (during the summer).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Seb (Apples):** The text says apples are used *throughout the year*, not just seasonally.
*   **B: Akhrot (Walnuts):** The text states that walnuts are included in *many* German baked goods, but doesn't mention seasonality.
*   **D: Badam (Almonds):**  Similar to walnuts, almonds are generally used and not tied to a specific season.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, budget yatra ke liye inme se konsi salah ka sujhav nhin diya jata hai?","Correct answer is **C: Logon se pese mange (Begging)**.

The passage explicitly states that travelers should *not* beg (""bhikh nahin maange""). 

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with budget travel as described in the passage:

*   **A: Yatra ke dauran naukri karna (Working while traveling):** While not explicitly mentioned, working while travelling could be a way to limit expenses, aligning with the overall concept of budget travel.
*   **B: Apni suvidhaon darkinar karna (Forgoing comforts):**  The passage implies this when it mentions sacrificing comfort, time, and the possibility of minimal expenses.
*   **D: Khane aur rukne ki jagah par kharchein kam karein (Reducing expenses on food and lodging):** This is a core element of limiting costs, and therefore budget travel.



"
Passage ke hisab se bahut kam budget mein yatra karne mein kise pareshani ho sakti hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Jise challenge pasand hain**.

Here's why:

The passage states that those who are willing to sacrifice comfort, time, and the possibility of reducing expenses to almost zero can consider minimal budget travel. This implies that minimal budget travel *is* challenging – it requires sacrifices. Therefore, someone who *likes* challenges would be the one least bothered by the potential difficulties of traveling on a very low budget.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jise samay ki koi kami nhin hai:** The passage implies minimal budget travel will *take* more time, not that you need to have plenty of it.
*   **C: Jo yatra ke dauran office ka kaam krne karne ki yojna bana rahe ho:** The passage doesn't mention anything about working while traveling.
*   **D: Jise yatra karyakram ka palan karne mein maja aata ho:** Minimal budget travel is more about flexibility and accepting limitations than strictly following a plan.



"
Inme se konsa kathan marrian aur fairmont ke beach gaadi chalne ka sahi varnan nhin karta?,"The correct answer is **C: Gati seema ka palan bahut kam kiya jata hai.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""**Jaari ke gayi gati seemaaen pehle ke tulna mein kafee kam hai -aam taur par yah 35-40 meal prati ghanta(56-60 kilo meter prati ghanta ) aur unke liye sakht niyam kafee jaruri hai**"" - meaning speed limits are *strictly enforced* and are lower than usual.  Therefore, the statement that speed limits are rarely followed is incorrect.

Let's look at why the other options are correct descriptions based on the passage:

*   **A: Shahar se dur gaadi chalane ka chunati bhara lamba rasta** - The passage describes a challenging drive through ""sunsan jungle ke beach"" (remote/isolated beaches).
*   **B: Patali galiyaan** - The passage mentions ""patali galiyaan"" (narrow streets).
*   **D: Mobile phone seva ki samasya nhin honi chaiye** - The passage states mobile phone service is *better* in this area compared to other parts of the Pennsylvania wilds.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Buffello-pitsburg haaive par yatra karne wale driveron ke liye inme se kya mukhya chinta ka vishay hona chaiye?","The correct answer is **C: khatarnaak mod par teze se chalna** (Driving too fast on dangerous curves).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""steep grades, narrow lanes, and dangerous curves."" It emphasizes these as challenging aspects of driving on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway.
* **It also mentions speed limits are low:** ""posted speed limits are considerably lower - typically 35-40 mph (56-60 kilometers per hour) and are strictly enforced."" This implies the danger of driving too fast.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bhari traffic mein phansna (Getting stuck in heavy traffic):** The passage says the road often passes through ""sparsely populated areas,"" suggesting *less* traffic, not more.
* **B: Mobile phone seva ki samasya (Problems with mobile phone service):** The passage actually states mobile phone service is *better* on this stretch of road compared to other parts of the Pennsylvania wilds.
* **D: Baar baar sadak nirmaan ka samana karna (Constantly encountering road construction):** The passage does not mention road construction.



"
Canyoning shuru karne ke liye inme se kiski jarurart nhin hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Shaaririk vikas**.

Here's why:

The passage states that canyoneering requires *relatively little* physical development (compared to activities like rock climbing). The other options (swimming, jumping, and little training) are all mentioned as components *of* canyoneering.

Therefore, strong physical development is the one thing *not* explicitly required."
Canyoning ke liye inme se kiski jarurart ho sakti hai?,"Sahi jawab hai **D: tairaki aana**.

Paasage mein saaf-saaf kaha gaya hai ki canyoneering mein **tairaki** ka tatv shamil hota hai. Passage ye bhi batata hai ki iske liye rok climbing, scuba diving ya alpine skiing jaise games ke tulna mein kam prashikshan aur shaaririk vikas ki aavashyakta hoti hai. Isiliye option A, B aur C sahi nahi hain."
"Passage ke hisab se, apni kar mein camping ke liye kya upyogi hoga?","The correct answer is **B: Aisi seatein jinhe niche kiya jaa sake (Seats that can be folded down)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Agar aapke paas ek badee minivan, suv, sedan yaa station wagon hai, jismein **seeten niche ke jaa sakti hain**, toh kar camping sambhav hai."" (If you have a large minivan, SUV, sedan or station wagon **where the seats can be folded down**, then car camping is possible.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Apni kar ki seemaon ki behatar samajh (Better understanding of your car's limits):** While the passage mentions knowing your car's limits, it doesn't say it's *necessary* for car camping. It's more about general safe driving.
*   **C: tent (Tent):** The passage mentions avoiding attracting attention by pitching a tent on private property or in a city, implying it's not always *needed* for car camping. The car itself can function as a ""camp.""
*   **D: Camp ke liy niji sampatti (Private property for camping):** The passage actually suggests *avoiding* camping on private property to avoid attention.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, agar kar camper radar ke niche rehna chahte hain to ve kisse bachana chahenge?","The correct answer is **C: Kisi sahar ya niji property par tent lagana**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Niji sampatti par yaa kisi bhi aakar ke shahar mein tambu gaana karna aasaanise binaa jarurat ke dhyan ko aakarshit kar sakta hai."" This translates to: ""Camping on private property or in any size city can easily attract unwanted attention.""

The question asks what a car camper would want to avoid to stay ""under the radar"". Avoiding camping in cities or on private property would help them do that.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Minivan ya suv jese badi gaadi chalana** - The passage doesn't suggest avoiding larger vehicles. It states people are likely *already* used to driving them.
*   **B: Lambi sadak yatra** - The passage *promotes* long road trips in a car.
*   **D: Ve jis gaadi ko chala rahe hain uske baare mein zyada jankari na hona** - The passage says knowing your vehicle's limits is important.



"
Passage ke hisab se casablanca ka dusri baar nirmaan kisne kiya?,"The correct answer is **D: Morakko ke sultan**.

The passage states: ""Morakko ke sultanne shahar ko daru ll-baadya ke naamse phir se banaaya..."" (The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Baida).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Purtagaali:** The passage says the Portuguese *destroyed* it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but not the second rebuilding.
*   **B: Spain ke vyapari:** Spanish traders *named* it Casablanca and established a trading center, but they didn't rebuild the city itself.
*   **C: Marinades:** The Marinades used it as a strategic port long before the modern city was established, but didn't rebuild it in the context described in the passage.



"
Prakratik apada ke baad adhunik shahar casablanca ko kisne chhoda?,"The correct answer is **B: Purtagaali**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Purtagaaliyonne ise khatm kar diya aur ise kasaa branca naamse isko phir se banaaya phir bhookamp ke baad ise 1755 mein chhod diya gaya.""  This directly translates to ""The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Kasaa Branca, then abandoned it after the earthquake in 1755.""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Romans:** The text mentions Romans using Anfa (old Casablanca) as a strategic port, but doesn't say they abandoned it.
*   **Spain ke log (Spanish people):**  They later established trading centers and named it Casablanca, but didn't abandon it after a disaster.
*   **Phonesian:** Like the Romans, they used it as a port, but didn't abandon it after a disaster.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, sintara ko videshiyon ke beech pehchan kese mili?","The correct answer is **C: lord byron ki sakaratmak samiksha**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Sintra became famous among foreigners ""**after being publicized by Lord Byron through his magnificent adventures.**"" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cabo da Roca:** While the bus route *goes to* Cabo da Roca, it doesn't explain Sintra's fame.
* **B: Marian apparitions:** The passage mentions the shrine where Marian apparitions are seen in the north, but doesn't connect it to Sintra's initial recognition by foreigners.
* **D: romantic ithihaas:** While Sintra *is* described as romantic, the passage says it gained fame specifically *because of* Lord Byron, not simply its romantic history.



"
Armenia kise maanyata nahi deta hai?,"Correct answer is **A: nagorno-karabakh kshetra**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""haalaanki, koi bhi sthaapit rashtra - yahaan tak ki armenia bhi - ise sarkari taur par maanyata nahin deta hai."" (""however, no established nation - even Armenia - officially recognizes it."")  ""Ise"" refers to the Nagorno-Karabakh region.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: azeris ke khilaaf yuddh** - The text says Armenia *fought* against Azeris, it doesn't say Armenia doesn't recognize the war itself.
*   **C: azerbaijan ke beach kootneetik turk** - The text says this relationship is strained, but Armenia doesn't *not recognize* it.
*   **D: nea ganarajya** - The text states a republic was formed *with Armenian support*, but that the republic is not recognized by any nation including Armenia. But the question asks what Armenia does *not* recognize.



"
Azerbaijan aur Armenia ke beach sambhandhin ko kisne bigaade rakha hai?,"सही उत्तर है **C: कूटनीतिक तौर पर**.

टेक्स्ट स्पष्ट रूप से बताता है कि ""प्रांत को लेकर आर्मेनिया और अज़रबैजान के बीच कूटनीतिक तौर पर बिगड़े संबंधों को जारी रखा जाता है""। अन्य विकल्प सीधे तौर पर संबंधों को बिगाड़ने का कारण नहीं हैं, बल्कि इस संघर्ष के पहलू हैं।

* **A:** अज़रबैजान में रहने वाले अर्मेनियाई संघर्ष का हिस्सा हैं, लेकिन वे संबंधों को बिगाड़ने का कारण नहीं हैं।
* **B:** 1994 का युद्ध संबंधों को बिगाड़ने की शुरुआत थी, लेकिन यह संबंध बिगड़ने का *निरंतर* कारण नहीं है।
* **D:** नागोर्नो-काराबाख क्षेत्र विवाद का केंद्र है, लेकिन यह स्वयं संबंधों को बिगाड़ने का कारण नहीं है।"
"Shorlett me taxi ka istemal karte samay, kis wajah se surcharge badh sakta hai?","The correct answer is **B: teen yatri hone ki wajah se**.

The passage states: ""2se zyada yatri hone par surcharge lagega, isliye yah vikalp zarooratse zyada mahanga parh sakta hai."" (A surcharge will be applied for more than 2 passengers, therefore this option can be more expensive than needed.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: doosre ilaakon me rehne ki wajah se** - The passage says people *move* to Charlotte from other areas, it doesn't say where you live affects taxi costs.
* **C: Uptown jaane ki wajah se** - The passage mentions Uptown has more family options, not that going there increases taxi fares.
* **D: parivaaron ke liye kafee acchi quality ki wajah se** - The quality of family options doesn't affect taxi surcharges.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, Shorlett me bachchon ke sath kyu nahi raha ja sakta?","The correct answer is **B: Taxi ka istemal** (Use of taxis).

Here's why:

The passage states that families in Charlotte *don't generally use taxis* and that taxis can be *expensive* with surcharges, especially with more than two passengers. This suggests a potential inconvenience for families, not that it's impossible to live with children, but that relying on taxis isn't a practical or cost-effective option.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: gharon ki keemat** (House prices) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the cost of housing.
*   **C: doosre ilaakon se aakar rehna** (Moving from other areas) - The passage states people *do* move to Charlotte from other areas *because* of its family-friendly environment.
*   **D: shahar ko enjoy karna** (Enjoying the city) - The passage clearly states children and families *enjoy* Charlotte.



"
"spainy logon ke aane se pehle, uttari chilly kinke adhin tha?","The correct answer is **D: Incas**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""16वीं शताब्दी में स्पेनियों के आने से पहले, उत्तरी चिली इनका के अधीन था..."" (""Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern Chile was under their control..."") and later identifies ""इनका"" as the people being referred to. While Mapuche were present in central and southern Chile, the passage explicitly states the *northern* region was under Inca rule before the Spanish arrived.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mapuche:** Mapuche inhabited central and *southern* Chile, not the north.
*   **B: America ke logon:** This is too general. The passage specifies a particular group.
*   **C: Araucanians:** Araucanians is an older term for Mapuche; while correct for a different region, it doesn’t answer the question about *northern* Chile.



"
1810 me inme se kya nahi hua tha?,"The correct answer is **B: Chilly ne Spain par jeet haasil ki** (Chile achieved victory over Spain).

Here's why:

The passage states that Chile declared independence in 1810, *but* a decisive victory over Spain wasn't achieved until 1818. Therefore, in 1810, Chile had *not* yet defeated Spain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: kendra sarkar ka na hona** (no central government) - The passage explicitly states Napoleon's wars left Spain without a functioning central government.
*   **C: napolean ke yuddh lade ja rahe the** (Napoleon's wars were being fought) -  The passage states these wars were happening *during* 1810.
*   **D: Chilly ne swatantra ghoshit kar di thi** (Chile declared independence) - The passage directly states Chile declared independence in 1810.



"
Liguria me log dur ke ganvon me kaise pahunch sakte hain?,"The correct answer is **C: train ya boat se** (train or boat).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""raaste, trains aur naaven gaanvon ko jodati hain, aur baaharse karen vahan nahin pahunch sakti hain."" (Roads, trains and boats connect the villages, and cars from outside cannot reach there.)

This directly tells us that trains and boats are the ways to reach these remote villages in Liguria.  Cars *cannot* reach them.



"
Italian shabdpad ‘Cinque Terre’ ka kya matlab hai?,"The correct answer is **A: paanch gaanv** (five villages).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sink tear, jiska earth hai paanch bhoomi, jo paanch chhote tateey gaon rayomegior, manrola, cornigleya, verneza, monterosose banaa liguria ke italvi kshetra mein sthit hai.""  This translates to ""Sink tear, whose earth is five lands, which five small tertiary villages rayomegior, manrola, cornigleya, verneza, monterosose form in the Liguria region of Italy.""  

""Cinque Terre"" literally means ""Five Lands"" or ""Five Villages"" in Italian, referring to these five settlements.



"
Sardiyon me fisalne wale raaston ke liye kis tarah ke jute sahi hote hain?,"The correct answer is **B: uchit tulle waale jute** (shoes with appropriate soles).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""kamse kam, aapko uchit tulle waale jute chaahiye"" which translates to ""at least, you need shoes with appropriate soles.""  It then goes on to describe what makes a sole appropriate for slippery winter conditions - a deep tread pattern (5mm or more) and a material that remains flexible in cold temperatures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: patli heels waale jute** (shoes with thin heels) - The passage states heels should be *low and wide*, not thin.
* **C: oonchi heel waale jute** (shoes with high heels) - High heels are mentioned as being *unsuitable* because they are less stable.
* **D: 1/5 inch gahare pattern ke bina jute** (shoes without a 1/5 inch deep pattern) - The passage specifically says the pattern *should* be 5mm (1/5 inch) or deeper.



"
"Sardiyon me barf wali sadkon par, inmen se kisse traction me sudhaar nahi hoga?","The correct answer is **D: paani (water)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that salt, gravel (kankar), and sand (reit) are *spread* on roads to *improve* traction.  Water, however, is the *cause* of slippery conditions (ice and snow are frozen water), and therefore will *reduce* traction, not improve it.

Therefore, water is the one option that doesn't help with traction in icy/snowy conditions."
Hawaii aur Kok island ke beech kya samaanta hai?,"The correct answer is **C: dono ka time zone same hai** (both have the same time zone).

The passage states: ""Hawai ke time zone ke samaan, dweepon ko kabhi-kabhi """"australiyai hawai"""" ke roop mein maanaa jaataa hai.""  This directly translates to ""Similar to Hawaii's time zone, the islands are sometimes considered 'Australian Hawaii'.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: dono me bade hotel hain** (both have big hotels) - The passage states the Cook Islands *don't* have large tourist hotels, unlike Hawaii.
* **B: dono desh nahi hain** (both are not countries) - Hawaii is a state of the US, and the Cook Islands *is* a country.
* **D: dono me koi shahar nahi hai** (both have no cities) - The passage specifically states the Cook Islands have no cities, but doesn't mention whether or not Hawaii does.



"
Inmen se kisse Kok island ko sahi se paribhaashit nahi kiya gaya hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Iske mukhya shahar Rarotonga aur Aitutaki hain.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""kok islands mein koi shahar nahin hai, lekin isamen 15 alag-alag islands hain. inmein rarotonga aur aitohtaaki pramukh hain.""  (Kok Islands does not have any cities, but has 15 different islands. Rarotonga and Aitutaki are prominent among them.)

* This means Rarotonga and Aitutaki are *islands* within the Kok Islands, not cities. Defining them as ""main cities"" is inaccurate according to the text.

Let's look at why the other options are correct as stated in the passage:

* **A: yah Hawaii se chhota hai** (it is smaller than Hawaii) - The passage directly compares its size to Hawaii.
* **B: yah ek archipelago hai** (it is an archipelago) - The passage states it's a group of 15 islands, which defines an archipelago.
* **D: Island ka time zone aur Hawaii ka time zone ek hi hai** (The island's time zone and Hawaii's time zone are the same) - The passage explicitly says this.



"
Inmen se kaunsa ranger station do tarah ke lodging vikalp deta hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

The text states: ""Cyrena ekmatra ranger station hai jo camping ke alawa shayanagar awas aur germ bhojan pradaan karta hai.""  This translates to ""Cyrena is the only ranger station that provides lodging besides camping and hot food.""

Therefore, Sirena (Cyrena) is the only one offering more than just camping.



"
"Agar aapko credit ki jagah cash ka istemal karna hai, to park permit kahan se book kiya ja sakta hai?","The correct answer is **B: Puerto Jiménez**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Park permit seedhe puerto jimenen ke ranger stationse park permit lia jaa sakta hai. haalaanki, way credit card sweekar nahin karte hain."" (Park permits can be obtained directly from the Puerto Jiménez ranger station. However, they do not accept credit cards.)

Since the question asks where to book a permit *using cash* (instead of credit), Puerto Jiménez is the only option that fits this criteria.



"
khade ilaakon me kis tarah ki skiing ki jaati hai?,"The correct answer is **C: alpine shally**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""alpine shally ke sky tauring yaa mountaineering shaili ke sky tauring, jise khade ilaakon mein kiya jaataa hai..."" (alpine-style skiing or mountaineering-style skiing, which is done in steep areas...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ski hiking:** The passage says backcountry skiing *can* be called ski touring or ski hiking, but it isn't *specifically* the type done in steep areas.
* **B: bekcontry sky:** The passage differentiates backcountry skiing from the type done on very steep terrain.
* **D: Bekpeking buy sky:** This is just a repetition of part of the name of backcountry skiing and doesn't relate to the steep area description.



"
bekcontry sky karne wale aese logon ko kisse madad mil sakti hai jo zyada unchaai par pahunchna chahte hain?,"The correct answer is **A: kade boot (sturdy boots)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that ""alpine shally ke sky tauring yaa mountaineering shamil nahin hoti hai, jise khade ilaakon mein kiya jaataa hai aur jiske liye bahut kadee sky aur boot ke zaroorat hoti hai.""  While backcountry skiing isn't *the same* as mountaineering, if someone wants to reach higher elevations within a backcountry skiing context, they'll need the equipment similar to what's needed for more challenging mountain terrain – specifically, sturdy boots.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: bhaari bag (heavy bag):** The text says you *won't* likely get the speed of cross-country skiing *with* a heavy bag.
* **C: Achchi pariisthitiyan (good conditions):** Good conditions help with distance, but don't help with reaching higher, steeper areas.
* **D: taiyar patariyan (prepared trails):**  Backcountry skiing, by definition, is *not* on prepared trails.



"
Punah pravesh jhatka experience karne wale yaatriyon ko kya karne me samasya aati hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Gharelu sanskriti ko wapas apnaana (Readopting the home culture)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that returnees have often adopted aspects of the foreign culture and *lost habits of their home culture*.  This makes it difficult to readjust and re-integrate. The passage focuses on the difficulties of re-entering and *re-adopting* one's original culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: nayi jagah ki sanskriti ko apnaana (Adopting a new place's culture):** This is the opposite of the problem. The travelers *already* adapted to a new culture.
* **B: dhairya aur samajh rakhna (Having patience and understanding):** The passage says others *lack* patience and understanding *towards* the returnees, not that the returnees lack these qualities themselves.
* **C: Videsh me ghoomne jana (Traveling abroad):** This isn't related to the challenges of *returning* from abroad.



"
Kis tarah ke yaatri ke Punah pravesh jhatka mukhya roop se kathin ho sakta hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Aese yaatri ko videsh me ghoomte samay wahan ki sanskriti ko turant apnaa lete hain**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jin yaatriyon ke paasnei sanskriti ko samaayojit karne ke liye ek achcha mauka tha, unke liye kabhi-kabhi unaki mool sanskriti ke liye vishesh roop se kathin samay hota hai.""  This translates to: ""For those travelers who had a good opportunity to integrate into the foreign culture, it can sometimes be a particularly difficult time for their original culture.""

This directly supports option B, as it describes travelers who *quickly* adopt the foreign culture, making the readjustment to their home culture more challenging.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't mention ""kharab sanskriti"" (bad culture). It focuses on the difficulty of *re-integrating* after adapting to a different culture.
*   **C:** The passage states re-entry shock lasts *longer* than the honeymoon phase, meaning those still *in* the honeymoon phase are less likely to experience it severely.
*   **D:** While patience is mentioned as lacking in others towards returning travelers, the passage doesn't state that *lack of patience in the traveler* is the core reason for the shock.



"
Logon ko moose ke saath kya nahin karna chahiye?,"The correct answer is **C: khatre ke star ko kam karna** (underestimating the danger).

Here's why:

The passage states that people don't *think* moose are very dangerous, which leads them to get too close and put themselves at risk. This means they are **underestimating the danger** posed by moose, even though moose will defend themselves if they feel threatened.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Unke hone ko andekha karna** (Ignoring their presence) - While important, the passage focuses on *how* people interact with moose when they *do* see them.
* **B: Dheere-dheere paas aana** (Slowly approaching) - The passage doesn’t specifically say *how* people get close, just that they *do* get close due to underestimating the risk.
* **D: Door se moose ko dekhna** (Watching moose from a distance) - This is a *safe* thing to do, not something to avoid!



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, inme se kaun sa kathan moose ke baare me sahi hai?","The correct answer is **D: Agar unhe khatra mehsoos hota hai to ve apni raksha karenge** (If they feel threatened, they will defend themselves).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Moose (jise elk bhi kahaa jaataa hai) sahaj roop se aakramak nahin hote, lekin yadi unhein koi khatra mahsoos hota hai, toh way apni raksha karenge."" (Moose are not naturally aggressive, but if they feel threatened, they will defend themselves.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ve praakritik roop se aakraamak hote hain** (They are naturally aggressive) - The passage states the opposite.
* **B: Unhen kabhi-kabhi khatra nahi maana jaata** (They are sometimes not considered dangerous) - While the passage *implies* this, it's not the main point, and option D is a more direct statement from the text.
* **C: Agar log unke zyada paas jaate hain to ve aakraamak ho sakte hain** (If people get too close to them, they can become aggressive) -  The passage says people *might* get too close because they don't perceive the danger, leading to risk, but doesn't directly state moose *become* aggressive when approached. They act in self-defense if they feel threatened.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, registan me yaatraa karne wale vyakti ke liye inme se kya sabse kam khatarnaak hoga?","The passage states that pursuing a mirage wastes valuable energy and water, which can be dangerous. It also states that not having warm clothes in a cold desert night can lead to hypothermia, which is a significant risk.

Comparing the options:

* **A: thandi raat me garm kapdon ka na hona (not having warm clothes in a cold night)** - The passage explicitly states this carries a ""bada khatra"" (big risk) of hypothermia.
* **B: aesi marichika dekhna jo paani jaisi lage (seeing a mirage that looks like water)** - Seeing a mirage itself isn't dangerous; the danger comes from *following* it.
* **C: marichika ka peechha karte hue energy waste karna (wasting energy pursuing a mirage)** -  The passage says this is wasteful and potentially dangerous.
* **D: marichika ka peechha karte hue paani waste karna (wasting water pursuing a mirage)** - The passage specifically emphasizes this as dangerous, as water is precious.

Therefore, simply *seeing* a mirage (option B) is the least dangerous of the options presented.  The passage doesn't say it's safe, but compared to the other options, it poses the smallest immediate threat.

**The correct answer is B.**"
Registan me yaatraa karne waalon ke liye inme se kya sambhavit khatra nahi hota?,"The correct answer is **A: paani ki kami (water scarcity)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states** that travelers experience thirst (leading to the illusion of water) and warns about wasting precious energy and water chasing mirages. This *directly* indicates water scarcity is a real danger.  Therefore, it *is* a potential hazard, not one that isn't.

Let's look at why the other options *are* hazards mentioned in the passage:

* **B: marichika (mirages):** The passage directly warns about the dangers of chasing mirages.
* **C: Hypothermia:** The passage states deserts can get very cold at night and warns of the risk of hypothermia without warm clothes.
* **D: Dhoop se jhulsan (sunburn):** While not directly stated, ""teekshan garmi"" (intense heat) strongly implies the risk of sunburn.

Therefore, only 'paani ki kami' is something the passage describes as a problem *caused* by the desert, not a risk *in* the desert.  The problem *is* the lack of water, the risk is wasting what little you have trying to find illusory water.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, khojkartaon ke aane ke baad inme se kiski aabaadi bahut kam ho gayi thi?","Correct answer is **C: tenos**.

The passage explicitly states: ""European khojkartaon ke aane ke baad kuch hi salon mein, spanish vijeta dwara tenos ke abadi kafee kam kar dee gayi thi."" (After the arrival of European explorers, within a few years, the population of the Taino people was greatly reduced by the Spanish conquerors.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: haiti:** The passage mentions Haiti as sharing the island, but doesn't say its population decreased after the explorers arrived.
*   **B: karaibiyai:**  While the passage mentions the Carib people, it specifically states the *Taino* population was reduced.
*   **D: Spain ke log:** The passage states the Spanish *reduced* the Taino population, not that their own population decreased."
"Passage ke anusaar, karaibiyai kaunsi bhasha bolte the?","The correct answer is **D: Arawakan**.

The passage states: ""carribes log arvakan bhasha bolate the..."" (Caribes people spoke the Arawakan language...).

Therefore, the answer is Arawakan."
Skiing ko manoranjak khel ke roop me popular karne ka shrey kise jaata hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Norwey ke log** (Norwegians).

The passage states: ""1861 mein australia mein norwey ke logon dwara pahala manoranjak sky club khola gaya tha."" (In 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ski bum:** Ski bums are people who *enjoy* skiing, not those who popularized it as a sport.
* **C: Cave dweller:** Cave dwellers depicted skiing in ancient art, but they didn't *popularize* the sport as recreation.
* **D: Australiyaai log:** Australians were the *location* where the first club was opened, but Norwegians were the ones who opened it and thus popularized the recreational aspect.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, lagbhag kis samay skiing ko khel ke roop me maanyata mili?","The correct answer is **D: 17veen shatabdi**.

The passage states: ""Downhill sking ek khel ke roop mein kamse kam 17 ween shatabdi mein shuru hui thi..."" which translates to ""Downhill skiing started as a sport at least in the 17th century...""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 18veen shatabdi (18th century):** The passage says *at least* the 17th century, making the 18th century too late as a starting point.
* **B: 5000 eesa poorv (5000 BC):** This refers to the earliest depictions of skiers in cave paintings, not when it was recognized *as a sport*.
* **C: 1861:** This is the year the first recreational ski club was opened, not when skiing itself began as a sport.



"
africa ke purvi tata ke parey sabse bada mahadweep kaunsa hai?,"The correct answer is **C: vanyajeev** (wildlife).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Medagaskar sabse bada apna khud ka vanyajeevan wala mahadweep hai."" (Madagascar is the largest island with its own wildlife.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: European prabhaav (European influence)** - The passage mentions European influence, but doesn't state it's the largest island.
*   **B: islam dharm (Islam religion)** - The passage mentions Islam's spread, but not as the largest island.
*   **D: lagzari beach resort (luxury beach resort)** - The passage mentions these islands are known for resorts, but it doesn't define the largest island.



"
Chhote poorvi afriki mahadweep ka attribute kya nahi hai? ,"The correct answer is **D: doosre deshon se swatantrata** (independence from other countries).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Adhikansh chhote dweep swatantra rashtra hain, **yaa fraansse sambandhit hain**"" (Most of the small islands are independent nations, **or are connected to France**). This means many are *not* independent, but linked to France.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, according to the passage:

*   **A: France se connection** (Connection to France) - Directly stated in the passage.
*   **B: bahut saare lagzari resort** (many luxury resorts) - The passage says they are ""jaane jaate hain lagzari beach resort ke roop mein"" (known as luxury beach resorts).
*   **C: vanyajeewan wala mahadweep** (wildlife-rich island) - Specifically mentions Madagascar as a large island with its own wildlife.



"
"Passage ke asnusaar, kuchh parmparagat churches mein easter kaisa manaya jata hai?","Correct answer is **B: shaniwar raat ko vigil rakhkar**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Zyada parmparagat churches mein easter saptahant mein shaniwar raat ko easter vigil ka aayojan kiya jaataa hai, jismein log cris ke punarjanam ka utsav manaane ke liye aadhi raat ke samay utsav manana shuru karte hain."" (In more traditional churches, an Easter vigil is organized on Saturday night of Easter week, in which people begin to celebrate around midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: fertility rasam rakhkar (by holding fertility rituals)** - The passage suggests a *possible* pre-Christian origin related to fertility, but doesn't say churches *practice* these rituals.
*   **C: punarjanam ke liye spring party rakhkar (by holding a spring party for resurrection)** - While spring and resurrection are connected thematically, the passage doesn't mention a ""spring party.""
*   **D: suryodaya dekhkar (by watching the sunrise)** - The passage mentions sunrise viewing as a tradition in *some* places, but not specifically in traditional churches' Easter celebrations.



"
"Equador me pravesh karte samay kuchh zaruraton se bachne ke liye, Cuba ke naagrik ke paas kya hona chahiye?","The correct answer is **D: US ka green card**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Cuba ke nagrik jo america ke green card dhaarak hain, unhein is aavashyaktase chhoot praapt karne ke liye equador ke vanijya dutawas mein jaanaa chaahiye.""  This means Cubans with a US green card are exempt from the invitation letter requirement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yaatra ki taareekh se 6 mahine pehle ka passport:** While a valid passport is required (with 6 months validity after the travel date), it doesn't *exempt* anyone from requirements, it's a basic necessity for everyone.
*   **B: kaanooni aamantran patra:** This is the requirement that Cubans *generally* need, but those with a green card are exempt *from* this.
*   **C: yah dikhaane ke liye ki kitne din rehna hai, round/onward trip ticket:** This is also a general requirement, not something that allows you to avoid other requirements.



"
Equador me yaatraa karne ki zaruraton ko kiske liye design nahi kiya gaya hai?,"The correct answer is **A: यात्रियों की संख्या को कम से कम रखने के लिए (To keep the number of travellers to a minimum)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on regulating the flow of Cuban citizens into Ecuador.** It details requirements like invitation letters and checks on passport validity and onward travel tickets. These are all about *managing* migration, not necessarily *reducing* the number of travellers.
* **B: Migration ki sthiti ko sahi rakhne ke liye (To maintain the migration situation correctly)** - This is a valid purpose. The requirements are clearly designed to control and regulate who enters the country.
* **C: Yaatri ke rehne ke din tay karne ke liye (To determine the days of the traveller’s stay)** -  The requirement to show a return/onward ticket does help determine how long someone intends to stay.
* **D: Passport ki maanyata sunshchit karne ke liye (To ensure passport validity)** - The passage explicitly states the passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the travel date.

The regulations aren't about discouraging travel; they're about controlling and documenting it, particularly for citizens of Cuba. Therefore, minimizing the number of travelers isn't the primary design goal."
Inme se kya apne desh ke muqaable dusre desh me mehnga ho sakta hai?,"The correct answer is **B: mehnge frame**.

Here's why:

The passage states that expensive brand-name frames *can be* more expensive in other countries due to potentially being stolen or imported, making them pricier than domestically produced frames.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aankhon ki jaanch (eye exams)** - The passage suggests eye exams might be *cheaper* at home if insurance covers them.
* **C: Aankhon ka beema (eye insurance)** - The passage simply mentions insurance *paying* for exams, not being more expensive abroad.
* **D: local frame (local frames)** - The passage implies local frames in other countries are cheaper due to lower labor and material costs.



"
Dusre desh me mehnge frame khareedna jokhim bhara kisliye ho sakta hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Ye chori ke ho sakte hain**.

Here's why:

The passage directly states: ""Aise kshetras mein upalabdh mahange brand-naam ke frame mein do samasyaaen ho sakti hain; **kuch chori ke ho sakte hain**..."" (In areas available with expensive brand name frames there can be two problems; **some may be stolen**...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: aankhon ki stirikt jaanch ki zaroorat ho sakti hai (a strict eye exam may be required):** The passage mentions getting an eye exam at home *before* buying, but doesn't say a strict one will be *required* abroad.
*   **B: Ho sakta hai ki Doctor ka parcha kuchh frames ke liye manya na ho (The doctor's prescription may not be accepted for some frames):**  The passage mentions bringing a prescription, but doesn't say it won't be accepted, only that you should bring it.
*   **D: Ho sakta hai beema iska bhugtan na kare (Insurance may not cover it):** The passage suggests insurance *might* pay for the exam at home, but doesn't address coverage for frames purchased abroad.



"
"Fockland me mudra ke isteman ke sambandh me, inmen se kaunsa kathan sahi hai?","The correct answer is **C: Dweep chhodne par Fockland pound ko badla jana chahiye** (Fockland pound should be exchanged before leaving the islands).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Dweepon ke baahar fockland ke karency ko badalana lagbhag asambhav hai, isliye dweep chhodanese pehle paas ko badalwa lain."" (It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland currency outside the islands, therefore exchange the currency before leaving the islands).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dweepon me keval credit card aur British pound sweekaar kiye jaate hain** (Only credit cards and British pounds are accepted on the islands) - This is incorrect. The passage says US dollars are *often* accepted too.
*   **B: keval steinly me hi US dollar sweekaar kiye jayenge** (US dollars will only be accepted in Stanley) - This is not stated in the passage. It says US dollars are ""often accepted"" generally.
*   **D: Fockland pound ke alawa, aam taur par sabse zyada British pound ko sweekaar kiya jata hai** (Apart from the Falkland pound, British pounds are generally the most accepted) - While British pounds are widely accepted, the passage doesn't state they are *most* accepted after the Falkland Pound.



"
"Passage ke aadhaar par, United States se Fockland jaane par, credit card ke alawa bhugtan karne ka koi aur tareeka kaam aa sakta hai?","सही उत्तर है **C: Bahar ke dweep par**.

यहाँ कारण दिया गया है:

पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि ""बाहरी द्वीपों पर क्रेडिट कार्ड शायद स्वीकार नहीं किए जाएंगे, हालांकि ब्रिटिश और संयुक्त राज्य मुद्रा स्वीकार की जाएगी।"" इसका मतलब है कि यदि आप बाहरी द्वीपों पर क्रेडिट कार्ड का उपयोग नहीं कर सकते हैं, तो आप ब्रिटिश पाउंड या अमेरिकी डॉलर का उपयोग कर सकते हैं। अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि:

*   **A: FIC West स्टोर में:** पाठ FIC West स्टोर के बारे में कोई जानकारी नहीं देता है।
*   **B: पूरे द्वीप पर:** पाठ में कहा गया है कि क्रेडिट कार्ड स्टेनली और द्वीपों पर स्वीकार किए जाते हैं, लेकिन बाहरी द्वीपों पर नहीं।
*   **D: स्टेनली में:** पाठ में कहा गया है कि क्रेडिट कार्ड स्टेनली में स्वीकार किए जाते हैं, लेकिन प्रश्न क्रेडिट कार्ड के अलावा अन्य भुगतान विकल्पों के बारे में पूछ रहा है।"
"Inme se kaunsa event, mandir ke tyohaar se smabandhit nahi hai?","The correct answer is **A: ek haathi ka janm (the birth of an elephant)**.

Here's why:

The passage states temple festivals are typically linked to:

*   **Mandir ka asthapna dinn (Temple's founding day)**
*   **Devta ka janmadin (Deity's birthday)**
*   **Mandir se jude dusre khaas din (Other special days related to the temple)**

While the passage *mentions* elephants are *part of* the festival celebrations (decorated elephants), it does *not* say the birth of an elephant is a reason for the festival itself. Therefore, an elephant's birth is not a reason for holding the festival."
saje huye haathi kahan dekhe jaa sakte hain?,"The correct answer is **D: Kerala ke mandiron mein**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Kerala ke mandiron mein manaae jaane waale tyauhar dekhne mein kafee mazedaar hote hain. inmein paaramparik tareekese saje-dhaje haathi..."" 
(The festivals celebrated in the temples of Kerala are very fun to watch. They include traditionally decorated elephants...)

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: November ke end se maee ke madhya tak har jagah** - While the festivals happen *during* this time, it doesn't say decorated elephants are everywhere.
*   **B: mandiron me** - This is too general; the passage specifies *Kerala* temples.
*   **C: mandir ke tyoharon me** - This is true, but Kerala's temples are specifically highlighted as having decorated elephants.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, business ya first class ki yatron par paise bachane ka sabse achcha tareeka kya hai?","The correct answer is **A: company se booking karwana (getting your company to book it)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""First yaa business class mein yatra karna suvidha ke liye adhik paise kharch karna hai (**yaa, behtar yah hai ki aap apni companyse booking karavaaen**)."" This directly translates to: ""Traveling in business or first class is spending more money for convenience (**or, it is better to have your company book it**).""

The passage doesn't suggest discounts are available (especially on direct flights) or that one class is cheaper than another. It explicitly points to company booking as a potentially better option.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: business ki jagah first class book karna (booking first class instead of business):** The passage says first class is *even more* expensive (eleven times the economy fare).
*   **C: Aesi first class flight book karna jo seedhi udaan na ho (booking a first class flight that isn't direct):**  The passage specifically states discounts are *not* found on direct flights, but doesn't mention anything about indirect flights being cheaper.
*   **D: Discount dhoondhna (looking for discounts):** The passage explicitly says discounts are unlikely, particularly on direct flights.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, Kuchh shreni me ticket book karte samay inme se kya samay ki barbaadi hogi?","The correct answer is **C: Discount**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""aam taur par aisaa kahaa jaataa hai ki seedhi udaanon mein eyese bee tak business yaa first class seats par kisi bhi soorat mein discount nahin diya jaataa hai.""  This directly translates to ""it is generally said that on direct flights, there is no discount whatsoever on business or first class seats.""

Therefore, according to the passage, booking in those classes (business or first) on a direct flight will result in a *loss* of discount – a waste of the opportunity to save money.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: seedhi udaan (direct flight)** - The passage discusses direct flights, but doesn't say they *cause* a waste of time.
*   **B: Business class** - Business class itself isn't a waste of time, though it's expensive.
*   **D: First class** - Similar to business class, first class is expensive, not a waste of time.

africa ke yatra ke kiraaye aur world-taur ke kiraaye mein tulna karte samay kya jodna nahi bhoolna chahiye?,"Correct answer is **D: Africa se bahar ki jagahon ka bhoomi parivahan ka kharch**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Africa ke baahar una sabhi asthanon ke liye atirikt veean, prasthaan kar, bhoomi parivahan, aadi ke atirikt laagat jodana naa bhoolen."" (Don't forget to add additional costs like visa, departure tax, ground transportation, etc. for all destinations outside of Africa).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Africa ke baahar una sabhi asthanon ke liye visa ka atirikt kharch** - Visa cost is mentioned in the passage as an additional cost.
* **B: Africa se prasthaan kar ka kharch** - Departure tax is mentioned in the passage as an additional cost.
* **C: Africa ke visa ka kharch** - The passage asks about comparing costs *to* Africa versus worldwide, so the visa *for* Africa isn't relevant to the comparison, it's the costs for destinations *outside* Africa that need to be considered.

"Passage ke anusaar, supermarket me inmen se kiske liye zyada vikalp mil rahe hain?","Correct answer is **A: Taiyar bhojan**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that supermarkets are rapidly increasing the variety of *ready meals* they offer. The entire paragraph revolves around the increasing options for prepared food within supermarkets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Microwave oven:** The passage mentions some meals come *with* a microwave, but doesn't say there are more options *for* microwave ovens themselves.
*   **C: onn-site restaurant:** While the passage mentions these exist in some supermarkets, it's presented as a separate point, not something supermarkets are expanding *within* the supermarket itself.
*   **D: kifaayati daam:**  Affordable prices are mentioned, but the passage is about the *variety* of options, not specifically price.



"
"Taiyar bhojan khareedte samay, Supermarket dwara pradaan kiye gaye Inme se kisse graahak sabse zyada aakarshit honge?","The correct answer is **D: microwave oven**.

Here's why:

The passage states that some supermarkets *provide* microwave ovens with certain ready meals. This implies a benefit to the customer - convenience. Customers buying ready meals are looking for ease and speed, and having a microwave oven readily available to heat the meal is a significant draw.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: onn-site restaurant:** While mentioned, it's presented as a separate option *alongside* ready meals, not something directly associated with purchasing ready meals.
*   **B: kam vividh khand (limited variety):**  The passage actually says supermarkets are *increasing* variety. Limited variety wouldn't attract customers.
*   **C: taiyar bhojan (ready meals):** This is what customers are already considering, so it's not something that would *attract* them further.

French bolne wala bengian aur switzerland ke logon ko inme se kya samajh nahi aa sakta hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Kuchh frech shabdon ka uchchaaran** (Some French words' pronunciation).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Belgium aur switzerland mein boli jaane waali french, fraans mein boli jaane waali frenchse thodi alag hai...kuch shabdon ka uchchaaran thoda-sha alag hai."" (French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland is a little different from French spoken in France...the pronunciation of some words is slightly different).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: maanak french ankan pranali** (Standard French numbering system) - The passage specifically says they *learn* standard French in school and would understand it.
* **B: Ajeeb se french shabd** (Strange French words) - The passage doesn't mention they struggle with unusual words, just slight differences.
* **D: France me boli jaane wali adhiktar french** (Most of the French spoken in France) - The passage says they can understand it to a large extent (""yekafee hadd tak samaan hain jinhen opus mein samajha jaa sakta hai"").



"
Inme se kya france me to hai lekin Belgium ya Switzerland e samaan nahi hai?,"सही उत्तर है **A: सभी शब्दों का उच्चारण**।

यहाँ कारण दिया गया है:

*   पैराग्राफ स्पष्ट रूप से बताता है कि ""कुछ शब्दों का उच्चारण थोड़ा-शा अलग है"" बेल्जियम और स्विट्जरलैंड में फ्रांसीसी बोलने वालों के बीच, फ्रांस में फ्रांसीसी बोलने वालों की तुलना में।
*   अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि:
    *   **ankan pranali (अंकन प्रणाली)** - पैराग्राफ में कहा गया है कि सभी फ्रांसीसी भाषी (फ्रांस, बेल्जियम और स्विट्जरलैंड) मानक फ्रांसीसी अंकन प्रणाली को समझेंगे।
    *   **School me padhai jaane wali french bhasha (स्कूल में पढ़ाई जाने वाली फ्रांसीसी भाषा)** - पैराग्राफ में उल्लेख है कि बेल्जियम और स्विट्जरलैंड में भी स्कूल में मानक फ्रांसीसी पढ़ाई जाती है।
    *   **Kuch French shabdon ki spelling (कुछ फ्रांसीसी शब्दों की स्पेलिंग)** - पैराग्राफ में स्पेलिंग में अंतर का कोई उल्लेख नहीं है, केवल उच्चारण में अंतर का उल्लेख है।

इसलिए, एकमात्र विकल्प जो फ्रांसीसी बोलने वालों के बीच बेल्जियम और स्विट्जरलैंड में फ्रांस से अलग है, वह सभी शब्दों का उच्चारण है।"
kis sthiti me aapko shock kiraaya milne ki sambhavana kam hai?,"The correct answer is **B: agar aap thid-party seva ke bajaay seedhe airline se book karne ki koshish karte hain**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sabhi mamalon mein, aapko airline ke booking seedhe p hone se karni hogi."" (In all cases, you must book directly with the airline.) This means if you *don't* book directly, you won't get the discounted fare.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Agar aap WestJet se yaatraa kar rahe hain** - The passage *includes* WestJet as an airline that offers the fare.
*   **C: Agar aap Lufthansa me Pars se United States ki yaatraa karte hain** - The passage mentions Lufthansa as an airline offering the fare, but doesn't specify routes.
*   **D: Agar aap Delta se yaatraa karte hain** - The passage *includes* Delta as an airline that offers the fare.



"
shock kiraaye ke baare me kya sahi hai?,"The correct answer is **A: antim sanskar ki antim yaatraa me chhoot dete hain (they offer discounts on final journey costs for funerals)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states:** ""Kewal kuch hi airlines shock kiraaye ke peshkash karti hain, jo antim sanskar ke antim yatra ke laagat mein thoda bahut chhoot detee hain."" (Only a few airlines offer bereavement fares, which provide some discount on the cost of the final journey for funerals).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Inhe seedhe airline ki website se book kiya jana chahiye (They should be booked directly through the airline's website)** - The passage says bookings must be made ""directly from the airline"" but doesn’t specify *how* (website vs. phone).
*   **C: Ve aakhri samay me yaatraa karne ki laagat cover karte hain (They cover the cost of traveling at the last minute)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about covering costs associated with last-minute travel.
*   **D: Unhen seedhe phone ki madad se airline se book kiya jana chahiye (They should be booked directly from the airline by phone)** - As mentioned above, the passage says ""directly from the airline,"" not necessarily by phone.



"
"GPS navigation app ke muqaable, GPS device ka istemaal karna zyada sahi kab hota hai?","The correct answer is **C: jab aap range se bahar hon** (when you are out of range).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Agar aapke phone mein deta connection nahin hai yaa jab wah out off range hota hai, toh unka performance seemit yaa anupalabdh ho sakta hai."" (If your phone doesn't have a data connection or when it is out of range, their performance can be limited or unavailable.) This directly indicates that a GPS device (which doesn't rely on data) is better when you're out of cell service range.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: jab aap paise bachane ki koshish kar rahe hon** (when you are trying to save money) - The passage states navigation apps *save* money compared to GPS devices.
* **B: jab pakka ho ki aapke paas data connection hoga** (when you are sure you will have a data connection) - This favors the *app*, not the device.
* **D: jab aapko device kiraaye par na lena ho** (when you don't want to rent a device) - This is irrelevant to the comparative accuracy of the two methods.



"
GPS device ke badle GPS navigation app ka istemaal karne ka sahi kaaran kya nahi hai?,"The correct answer is **A: data connection ki chinta na karna** (Not having to worry about data connection).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Agar aapke phone mein deta connection nahin hai yaa jab wah out off range hota hai, toh unka performance seemit yaa anupalabdh ho sakta hai."" (If your phone does not have a data connection or when it is out of range, their performance may be limited or unavailable).

This means a *limitation* of using a GPS navigation app *is* the reliance on data connection.  The other options (B, C, and D) are presented as *benefits* of using an app instead of a dedicated GPS device.

Therefore, needing data connection is a reason *not* to rely solely on a GPS navigation app."
"Passage ke anusaar, aap yah kaise pakka karenge ki aapko sahi ship ke saath match kiya gaya hai?","The correct answer is **C: Galapagos travel ke agent se book karwa ke** (By booking through a Galapagos travel agent).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""is baat mein puri tarah nishchint ho jaaen ki aapne jis agent ke jariye book kiya hai, wah jahaajon ke kayee kismon ke achche gyaan ke saath ek gallapagos ka visheshagya hai. Yah sunishchit karega ki aapke khaas hit aur / yaa samasyaaen jahaajse mail karein jo unke sabse upayukt ho."" (Be sure that the agent you booked through is a Galapagos expert with good knowledge of the many types of ships. This will ensure that your specific interests and/or problems match the ship that is most suitable for them.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: samaan ruchi rakhne wale 8 se zyada yaatrin ke sath book karke** (By booking with more than 8 travelers with similar interests) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the number of travelers or needing to share interests with them.
*   **B: aese samay book karke jab peak season na ho** (By booking a time when it is not peak season) - While the passage mentions boats are full during peak season, it doesn't say booking off-peak will ensure you get the *right* ship.
*   **D: pahle se book karke** (By booking in advance) -  The passage mentions booking in advance is generally necessary, but it doesn't guarantee the ship will be a good match.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, mehmaanon ko gambling karte rehne ke liye kaunsa tareeka nahi apnaya jata?","The correct answer is **A: bahut si praakritik roshni (a lot of natural light)**.

Here's why:

The passage states casinos try to maximize time and money spent by guests through things like:

*   Special food and drink
*   Entertainment
*   Offering alcohol (though acknowledging it can impair judgment)
*   Making it difficult to find exits
*   Removing clocks (implied by ""ghadiyaan na lagana"")

It does **not** mention using natural light as a tactic to keep people gambling. In fact, casinos are often designed *without* much natural light to disorient guests and make them lose track of time.

Therefore, ""bahut si praakritik roshni"" is the only option that is *not* a strategy mentioned in the passage.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: muft concert ticket jaisi cheezein (free concert tickets and such)** - This falls under the category of entertainment.
*   **C: muft drink (free drinks)** - Specifically mentioned as a tactic.
*   **D: ghadiyaan na lagana (removing clocks)** - Directly stated as a common practice."
"Passage ke anusaar, ek achhe juaari ko kya nahi karna chahiye?","The correct answer is **A: bahut zyada sharaab peena (drinking too much alcohol)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...nashes e nirnay prabhaavit hota haiye, aur sabhi achche juari saadaa rahne ke mahatva ko jaanate hain.""  This translates to: ""Intoxication affects judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.""

Therefore, a good gambler should *not* drink too much alcohol.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: muft me koi cheez lena (taking something for free):** The passage doesn't mention anything about taking free things.
*   **C: ghadiyaan dekhte rehna (keep looking at watches):** The passage doesn't mention watches or time-checking.
*   **D: baahar nikalne ka sabse nazdeek ka rasta khojna (finding the nearest way to exit):** The passage actually states finding the exit can be *difficult*, suggesting it's not something a gambler should avoid in principle, but rather something casinos try to prevent.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, vakya ke beech ke kis part of speech ke pehle akshar ko bade akshar me likha jata hai?","The correct answer is **B: sangya (noun)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Saaee ke saath-saath sabhi **sangya shabd** hamesha angrezi ke badey aksharse hi shuru hote hain..."" (Along with proper nouns, all **nouns** always begin with capital letters in English...)

The passage focuses on the capitalization of nouns, even when they appear in the middle of a sentence. It mentions this is sometimes tricky to distinguish from verbs and adjectives."
"Passage ke anusaar, sangya ke pehle akshar ko bade akshar me likhne se kya mushkil aa sakti hai?","The correct answer is **C: likhne me**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...*halanki yah pata lagaane ke aavashyaktase likhana kanhi zyada mushkil hai ki kya ek kriya yaa visheshan ka upayog sahi dhangse kiya gaya hai.*""  This translates to ""...although it is much more difficult to write correctly to determine whether a verb or adjective has been used correctly.""

Therefore, the difficulty lies in *writing* when always capitalizing nouns, as it makes it harder to check the correct usage of other parts of speech.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: padhne me (in reading):** The passage states it *makes reading easier*, not harder.
*   **B: kriya ke beech antar karne me (in differentiating verbs):**  Capitalizing nouns *helps* differentiate them, but isn't the source of a difficulty.
*   **D: karm ke beech antar karne me (in differentiating objects):** The passage doesn't mention difficulty in differentiating objects."
"Malaysia ke grameen ilaakon me, kis ishaare ka matlab hota hai “milane aao”?","The correct answer is **B: haath lehrana**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Haalaanki, malaysia mein, kamse kam grameen kshetras mein malaysia ke logon ke beach, iska matlab hai """"milane aao,"""""" referring to waving a hand.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: tarjani ungali ko modna (bending the index finger)** - The passage compares the gesture to pointing with the index finger, not bending it.
*   **C: high-five karna (high-five)** - This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: thumbs up karna (thumbs up)** - This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, kis ishaare ka matlab hota hai “wapas aao”?","The correct answer is **A: Haath ko andar ki or rakh kar lehrana**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""In Spain, a British traveler might mistake waving a hand with the palm inward as a recall gesture, with the palm facing toward the waver (rather than the person being waved to).""  This directly describes waving a hand with the palm inward as meaning ""come back.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: tarjani ungali ko modna (bending the index finger):** The passage mentions pointing the index finger in Malaysia, but not bending it.
*   **C: Haath ko bahar ki or rakh kar lehrana (waving a hand with the palm outward):** The passage says this is generally understood as ""hello"" in many parts of the world.
*   **D: sar hilaana (shaking the head):** This isn't mentioned in the passage at all.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, himvider kis wajah se hote hain?","Sahi jawab hai **B: glacier ke sthir na hone se**.

Passage mein likha hai, ""Glacier stir nahin hote, lekin phad ke niche bahate hai. yah daraaren, himvider paida karenge..."" iska matlab hai ki glaciers ki harkat (stir na hone ke bawajood bhi bahna) himvider (crevasses) banati hai.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: barf ke girne se** - Barf girna daraaren bana sakta hai, lekin passage himvider ko glacier ke bahne se jodta hai.
*   **C: barf ki gufaaen dhahne se** - Barf ki gufaein dhahne se daraaren band ho sakti hain, himvider nahin.
*   **D: block ke kamzor hone se** - Block ke kamzor hone se glacier ke kinaron par ice calve hoti hai, lekin himvider nahin.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, barf ke pul se kya chhip sakta hai?","Sahi jawab hai **A: daraaren**.

Passage mein likha hai, ""daraaren, himvider paida karenge, jo him setu dwara dhundhale ho sakte hain."" (Glaciers create crevasses which can be hidden by ice bridges.)

Iska matlab hai ki him setu (ice bridge) daraaren ko chhupa sakta hai.
"
"Passage ke aadhaar par, kis jagah par jaate samay yaatriyon ko zyada saavdhaani baratni chahiye?","The correct answer is **B: Goma ke aas-paas ke ilaake** (the areas around Goma).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Halanki goma yathochit surakshit hai, lekin goma ke baahar jaate samay uttar kivu praant mein chal rahi ladaai ke isthiti ko samajh lena chaahiye."" This directly translates to: ""Although Goma is reasonably safe, one should understand the situation of the fighting going on in the North Kivu province when leaving Goma.""

This means travellers should be cautious *outside* of Goma, in the surrounding region, due to the ongoing conflict.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nyiragongo volcano:** The passage mentions climbing the volcano, but doesn't say it's particularly dangerous to *go* there, just that it's a base for climbing.
*   **C: town center:** The passage mentions the town center was damaged by lava, but doesn't say it's currently unsafe.
*   **D: Rwanda:** Rwanda is mentioned as being east of Goma, but there's no warning about danger in Rwanda within the passage.



"
Gome me paryatak ke liye kya ek achha sujhaav nahi hai?,"Sahi jawab hai **A: North Kivu me mazedaar fight hoti hain**.

Kyuki passage mein uttar kivu praant mein chal rahi ladaai ke isthiti ko samajhne ki chetawani di gayi hai. ""mazedaar fight"" ise halke mein lena dikhata hai, jo ki paryatak ke liye achha sujhaav nahi hai.

Baaki ke options sahi hain:

*   **B:** Passage mein kaha gaya hai ki Goma Africa ke kuch sabse saste pahadi gorilla treking ke saath hi nairagongo jwalamukhi ke saath hi nairagongo jwalamukhi ke chadhaai karne ka bases bhi hai.
*   **C:** Passage mein bodaa-bodaa (motorcycle taxi) ka zikr hai.
*   **D:** Passage mein kaha gaya hai ki Goma Nyiragongo volcano ka base hai."
August ke liye backcountry permit kis din se uplabdh hoga?,"The correct answer is **B: 1 April**.

Here's why:

The passage states the permits become available ""four months before the start of the month."" August is the 8th month. Four months prior to August is April. Therefore, the permits for August will be available on April 1st."
Canyon ki suraksha ke liye kaunsi neeti hai?,"Sahi jawab hai: **A: Pehle aao, pehle pao wala permit system**

**Vyakhya:**

Paath mein saaf-saaf kaha gaya hai ki ""Yahaan pehle aao, pehle pao ke aadhar par walk-in anurodhon ke liye seemit sankhya mein permit reserve kiye gaye hain."" Isse pata chalta hai ki canyon ki suraksha ke liye pehle aao, pehle pao wala permit system hai.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Pevmit keval 1 January ko hi uplabdh honge:** Paath mein kaha gaya hai ki permit mahine ke 1 tarikh ko chaar mahine pehle uplabdh ho jaate hain, sirf 1 January ko nahin.
*   **C: Permit keval walk-in anurodhon par hi mil sakte hain:** Paath mein ye bhi kaha gaya hai ki aarakshan khole jaane ke pehle din milane wale anurodhon se jagah bhar jaati hai, isliye ye sirf walk-in anurodhon par hi uplabdh nahin hai.
*   **D: Permit ki seemit sankhya:** Ye sahi hai ki permit ki sankhya seemit hai, lekin ye canyon ki suraksha ke liye *neeti* nahin hai."
"Passage me jis prakaar ke hotel ka varnan kiya gaya hai, unme kiske milne ki sambhavna sabse kam hai?","Sahi jawab **D: naye aur naveentam suvidhaaon wale kamre** hai.

**Passage ke anusar:**

*   **Puraane dhang ke fitting** hote hain.
*   **Navintam suvidhaon ke kamee** hoti hai.
*   Hotel **sundar vriddhavastha** ke hote hain.

Iska matlab hai ki un hotelon mein naye aur naveentam suvidhaaon wale kamre hone ki sambhavna kam hai.

**Dusre vikalp galat kyun hain:**

*   **Cocktail bar:** Ameer aur prasiddh log aise hotels mein cocktail bar ka anand le sakte hain.
*   **Onsite gourmet restaurant:** Passage me kaha gaya hai ki aise hotels mein aksar badhiya bhojan kiya jata tha, jo ki onsite gourmet restaurant ka sanket hai.
*   **Aise mehmaan jo ameer aur prasiddh hain:** Passage me vishisht roop se kaha gaya hai ki aise hotels mein ameer aur prasiddh log rukhte the.

"
"Passage ki jaankaari ke anusaar, Hotel me rukne wale mehmaan, inme se kis suvidha ko sabse kam praathmikta denge?","The passage states that these hotels are characterized by ""navintam suvidhaon ke kamee"" (lack of modern amenities). This directly implies that modern comforts are *not* a priority in these hotels. 

Of the options provided, ""kifaayti kamre"" (comfortable rooms) represents a modern amenity. The other options - antique furnishings, a good restaurant, and evening entertainment - are all things the passage suggests *are* present and valued in these hotels.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: kifaayti kamre**.
"
"Passage ke anusaar, Greenland jaate samay yaatriyon ko kya nahi karna chahiye?","The correct answer is **D: Greenland ke native ko “Eskimo” kehkar nahi pukaarna chahiye**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: *""haalaanki """"eskimo"""" shabd sanyukt rajya america mein sweekarya hai, kintu ise kayee gair-amriki arctic logon dwara, vishesh roop se kanada mein apmaanjanak maanaa jaataa hai. ... iske upayog ko videshiyonse bachana chaahiye.""* (Although the word ""Eskimo"" is accepted in the United States, it is considered offensive by many non-American Arctic peoples, especially in Canada... its use should be avoided by foreigners.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Zyada Crime wale ilaakon me nahi jana chahiye** - The passage states that crime is ""virtually unknown"" in Greenland.
*   **B: bhaari kapde nahi le jane chahiye, kyuki wahan pure saal garam mausam rehta hai** - The passage warns about the cold weather, especially when travelling further north, and emphasizes the need for warm clothing.
*   **C: Wahan kaam karne ka nahi sochna chahiye, kyuki intenet connection slow ho sakta hai** - The passage mentions good internet connectivity in Greenland and doesn't suggest avoiding work due to this.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, taiyaari na karke jaane wale yaatriyon ke liye Greenland me sabse zyada mushkil bhara kya ho sakta hai?","The correct answer is **C: Mausam**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""thand ka mausam shayed ekmatra vaastavik khatra hai jiska saamana binaa taiyari vaalon ko karna hoga."" (The cold weather is perhaps the only real danger that travelers who are unprepared will face.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nordic machchhar:** While the passage mentions Nordic mosquitoes, it states they don't spread disease and are only ""taklifdeh"" (troublesome).
*   **B: Crime:** The passage says ""Aparadh...greenland mein vastutah agyaat hai"" (Crime...is practically unknown in Greenland).
*   **D: local log:** The passage states that ill-treatment towards foreigners is unknown in Greenland.



"
Inme se kise ab central plaza ke roop me istemaal kiya jata hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ab yah kendriya plaza ke roop mein kary karta hai, aur jahaa din aur raat bahut saree kam chalte hain."" (""Now it functions as a central plaza, and where a lot of activity happens day and night."")  This refers to Jardín de la Unión.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: The Alley of the Kiss (Callejon del Beso):** The text describes it as a location with a love story, where children tell the story for money.
* **C: Templo de San Diego:** The text states it's the *only remaining building* from the 17th-century convent that originally formed the atrium, but doesn't say it's used as a plaza.
* **D: Callejon del Beso:** Same as B – it’s a specific location, not the whole plaza.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, Jardín de la Unión me kya nahi milta?","सही उत्तर है **D: puraani building** (पुरानी इमारत)।

पैसेज में बताया गया है कि Jardín de la Unión पहले 17वीं शताब्दी के कॉन्वेंट का हिस्सा था, लेकिन अब केवल टेम्पलो डे सैन डिएगो ही बची है। इसका मतलब है कि कॉन्वेंट की अन्य इमारतें मौजूद नहीं हैं। 

अन्य विकल्प सही हैं:

*   **A: central gazebo me concert** (सेंट्रल गेज़ेबो में कंसर्ट) - पैसेज में कहा गया है कि गेज़ेबो में अक्सर मुफ्त संगीत कार्यक्रम होते हैं।
*   **B: prem katha ka ghar** (प्रेम कथा का घर) - Callejon del beso (चुंबन की गली) को प्रेम कथा का घर बताया गया है।
*   **C: Bageeche ke aas-paas restaraan** (बगीचे के आसपास रेस्टोरेंट) - पैसेज में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि बगीचे के आसपास कई रेस्टोरेंट हैं।"
"Passage ke aadhaar par, din me hiking karte samay inme se kis kathan ko galat maana jaa sakta hai?","The correct answer is **D: Din me hiking karna aese parivaaron ke liye sahi nahi hai jinme bachche hain**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**Chhote bachchon waale parivar ko zyada taiyari ke zaroorat hogi, lekin chhote bachchon aur pri-school bachchon ke saath bhi ek din baahar ke ser aaramse sambhav hogi.**"" (Families with small children will need more preparation, but a day out with young and pre-school children is also comfortably possible).

This directly contradicts option D, which claims day hiking is *not* suitable for families with children.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

*   **A:** ""Aasaan raaston par din me hiking ke liye thodi taiyaari ki zarurat hoti hai"" - The passage says ""Saral prabhaav ke saath ek din ke vriddhi ke liye thodi taiyari kar lenny chaahiye"" (For a simple day hike, a little preparation should be done).
*   **B:** ""Doori zyada ho sakti hai, lekin unhen ek din ke andar cover kiya jana chahiye"" - The passage defines day hiking as a distance ""jise ek hi din mein cover kiya jaa sakta hai"" (which can be covered in a single day).
*   **C:** ""Aam taur par, thode fit log is gatividhi aa aanand le paate hain"" - The passage states ""koi bhi samanya roop se fit vyakti unka anand le sakta hai"" (any reasonably fit person can enjoy it).



"
"Passage ke anusaar, din me hiking karte samay kab kam taiyaari ki zarurat kab hoti hai?","The correct answer is **A: jab hiker sharirik taur par fit ho** (when the hiker is physically fit).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Saral prabhaav ke saath ek din ke vriddhi ke liye thodi taiyari kar lenny chaahiye, aur **koi bhi samanya roop se fit vyakti** unka anand le sakta hai."" This directly translates to: ""A little preparation should be done for a day's increase with simple impact, and **any normally fit person** can enjoy it.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: jab raasta aasaan ho** (when the path is easy) - The passage doesn't specifically mention the path being easy influencing the amount of preparation needed.
* **C: jab bachche hiking karne ja rahe hon** (when children are going hiking) - The passage specifically says families *with* small children need *more* preparation.
* **D: jab hiking prakritik paryavaran me ho** (when hiking in a natural environment) -  The passage states hiking *is* done in a natural environment, but doesn't link that to needing less preparation.



"
"Baaki bache Norway ki tulna me, Rogland aur agder me pathaar ke baare me kya alag hai?","The correct answer is **D: Ve samanyatah heather se dhake hote hain**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Rogland aur agder mein unhein aam taur par """"heyee"""" kahaa jaataa hai jiska earth veeraan daldali bhoomi hota hai jo aksar headerse aachchhaadit hoti hai.""  This translates to: ""In Rogaland and Agder, they are commonly called 'heyee' which is earth covered with heather.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wahan ped hain** - The passage doesn't mention trees in relation to the stone formations in Rogaland and Agder.
*   **B: Wahan fjord nahi hain** - The passage does not mention fjords at all.
*   **C: Pathaar zyadatar plain hain** - The passage states the landforms are slopes and valleys, not plains.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, Normay me aam taur par kya nahi hota?","The correct answer is **B: Samtal pathaar**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states Norway is known for *steep slopes and valleys* which *suddenly form a high, more or less flat plateau*. It then goes on to describe these plateaus as ""widths"" (chaudaai) - a wide, open space. 

Therefore, the passage emphasizes the *lack* of consistently flat land and instead highlights the abrupt transition to plateaus. The other options are all mentioned as being typical of Norway:

*   **A: Dharti ka khula failaav (Wide, open expanses of land):**  Described as ""chaudaai"".
*   **C: khadi dhalaan (Steep slopes):**  The passage starts by stating this is characteristic of Norway.
*   **D: Moorland:** Mentioned as ""heyee"" in Rogaland and Agder, describing a desolate marshy land, which is a type of moorland.



"
Skiing me ruchi rakhne wale paryatakon ko hill station kab jana chahiye?,"The correct answer is **A: Sardiyon ke mausam me (In winter season)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...sardiyon ke dauran unka ek alag tarah ka saundarya aur aakarshan hota hai, jab kayee hill station mein acchi barf hoti hai aur way sking aur snowboarding jaisi gatividhiyon ke peshkash karte hain."" ( ""...during winters they have a different kind of beauty and attraction, when many hill stations have good snow and offer activities like way sking and snowboarding."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Peak season me (In peak season)** - Peak season could be summer, not specifically for skiing.
* **C: Bhartiya garmiyon me (In Indian summers)** - The passage says tourism is *higher* in summer, but skiing isn't possible without snow.
* **D: Vasant ritu ke dauraan (During spring)** - While there might be some snow in early spring, it's generally not reliable for skiing.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, aamataur par hill stussions par sabase jyaada paryatak kab aate hain?","The correct answer is **C: garmiyon ke dino mein**.

The passage explicitly states: ""bhartiya hill stussions par paryatakon ka zyada jamaavaa **garmiyon ke dino mein** hota hai"" which translates to ""Indian hill stations see the biggest influx of tourists **during the summer days**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jab hill station mein acchi barf hoti hai (When there is good snow in the hill stations):** The passage says snow attracts tourists in *winter*, but not that this is the *most* popular time.
*   **B: snowboarding season me (During the snowboarding season):** Snowboarding is mentioned as an activity *available* in winter, not the primary reason for most visits.
*   **D: sardiyon ke dauran (During the winter):** The passage states winter has a different beauty and attraction, but *more* tourists come in summer.



"
"Agar aapko koi naav dhudhne me madad chahiye, to aapko kya nhi karna chahiye?","The correct answer is **D: apne saath yatra karne waale any yatriyo ko ignore karna** (ignoring other passengers traveling with you).

Here's why:

The passage *specifically* states: ""aapko vahan naav mein apne saath yatra karne waale any yatri milenge aur way aapko apni jaankari bataayenge."" (You will meet other passengers traveling with you on the boat, and they will share information with you.)  The advice is to *engage* with them, not ignore them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ghaat par oopar-neeche ghoomna** (wandering up and down the ghat) - This isn't mentioned as something to avoid, and is a natural part of looking for a boat.
* **B: kaptaanon se dosti** (befriending captains) -  The passage encourages making contact with boatmen (""baar mein naavikonse sampark banaane ke koshish aadi karenge""). Befriending captains would be part of that.
* **C: apani sevaon ka vigyaapan** (advertising your services) - The passage mentions offering help (""mool roop se, aap apni madad dene ke liye notice pesh karenge""). Advertising your services *is* what you should be doing.



"
"Agar aapko koi naav dhudhne me madad chahiye, to aapko marina me kya karna chahiye?","The correct answer is **A: naavikon se sampark banaayege** (You will contact the boatmen/sailors).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""...baar mein naavikonse sampark banaane ke koshish aadi karenge"" (Try to connect with the sailors at the bar).  This directly advises contacting the sailors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Radar me rahege (Stay on the radar):** The passage doesn't mention radar at all.
* **C: Sirf un logon se baat karenge jo apni naav ki safai kr rhe ho (Only talk to those cleaning boats):** The passage suggests talking to *many* people, not just those cleaning boats.
* **D: apne saath yatra karne waale any yatriyo se bachege (Avoid other passengers traveling with you):** The passage says you *will* meet other passengers and they will help you.



"
dweep ke aupaniveshik ateet mein ruchi rakhane vaale paryatak ko kaun sa sthaan pasand aaega?,"The correct answer is **A: Uttari Tata (Northern Shore)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hangkang dweep ke shahari vikas ka jyaadaatar hissa punah nirmit bhoomi par uttari tata ke saath adhik roop se bharaa hua hai. yah wah jagah hai jahaan british upaniveshvaadiyonne apna banaaya aur isliye agar aap is jagah ke aupaniveshik ateet ke sabooton ko dhoondh rahe hain, toh yah ek achchi jagah hai.""  (Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is heavily concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore. This is where the British colonists established themselves, and therefore if you are looking for evidence of the place’s colonial past, this is a good place to be.)

The question specifically asks where a tourist interested in the colonial past would enjoy. The passage directly links the northern shore to the colonial history.



"
sarvshreshth najare prapt karne ke liye aapko kha jana chahiye?,"The correct answer is **C: Hangkang dweep**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hangkang ke sarvshreshth naaren praapt karne ke liye, dweep ko chhonen aur covloon waterfront ke vipareet chale jaye.""  This translates to ""To get the best views of Hong Kong, touch the island and go opposite the Kowloon waterfront."" 

Therefore, the passage specifically says to go to **Hangkang dweep** (Hong Kong Island) for the best views.



"
kuchh kathiyon mein aisa kya hota hai jo savaar ke pair ke rakab mein phansane ke jokhim ko kam karane mein madad karta hai?,"The correct answer is **B: suraksha pattiyaan** (safety straps).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...*kuch kathi, vishesh roop se angrezi kathi mein suraksha pattiyaan hoti hain jismein ek rakab chaman kathise girata hai yadi ek girata hua savaar use peechhe ke or khinchata hai.*"" (Some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety straps that release the stirrup if a falling rider pulls back on it). This directly addresses reducing the risk of a foot getting stuck.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: kafee patale tale vaale riding boots** (thin-soled riding boots) - While mentioned, they don't *release* the stirrup, they just help with feel.
*   **C: chamade ki rakab** (leather stirrups) - The material of the stirrup isn't mentioned as a safety feature.
*   **D: adhik sthirata pradhan karte hain** (provide more stability) - This describes a function of stirrups generally, not a safety feature to prevent getting stuck.



"
riding boot ki kaun si visheshata rakab ka upayog karte samay savaar ki suraksha badhaane mein madad karti hai?,"The correct answer is **A: kafee patale tale** (sufficiently thin soles).

Here's why:

The passage states that most riders wear boots with ""a chikni, kafee patale tale"" (smooth, sufficiently thin soles). This is specifically mentioned as a safety feature related to stirrups. Thin soles allow the rider's foot to be firmly seated in the stirrup, reducing the chance of it getting stuck and pulled during a fall.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Chamda (Leather):** While boots are often made of leather, the passage doesn't highlight leather as a safety feature regarding stirrups.
*   **C: heal (Heel):** Heels are mentioned alongside thin soles, but the *thin sole* is what directly relates to preventing the foot from getting caught.
*   **D: Chaude tale (Warm soles):** The passage doesn't mention anything about the temperature of the soles.



"
Hospitality exchange network ke madhyam se yaatriyon ko kaun si suvidhayen milti hai?,"The correct answer is **A: sthaaniya mezbaanon ke saath rahne ki suvidha** (The facility to stay with local hosts).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Hospitality exchange network aisaa sangathan hai jo una shaharon mein yaatriyon ko sthaaniya logonse jodata hai..."" (Hospitality exchange networks are organizations that connect travelers in unfamiliar cities with local people...).  This means the primary benefit is finding a place to stay with locals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: sasti flight** (cheap flight) - The passage mentions Kessy Fentonne *finding* a cheap flight, but the network itself doesn't *provide* cheap flights.
* **C: sthaaniya guide ki suvidha** (facility of a local guide) - While hosts might *act* as guides, this isn't the core purpose of the network.
* **D: Usi jagah ja rhe any yaatriyon ke sath sampark** (contact with other travelers going to the same place) - The passage mentions reviews *from* other travelers, but doesn't say the network facilitates direct contact between travelers going to the same destination.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, hospitality exchange network ke sambandh mein nimnalikhit mein se kaun sa kathan saty nhi hai?","Correct answer is **A: shaharon mein yaatriyon ko hmesha sthaaniya logonse jodata hai**

Here's why:

The passage states hospitality exchange networks *connect* travelers with locals in the cities they are visiting.  It doesn't say they *always* connect them. It's possible, though not explicitly stated, that a connection isn't always possible. 

Let's look at why the other options are true according to the passage:

*   **B:** ""Kuch network atirikt satyapan karne ke liye kahte yaa maang karte hain"" - The passage directly states this.
*   **C:** ""Shahar me upalabdh mezbaanon ke soochi yaatriyon ko pradaan ke jaati hai"" - The passage states ""Upalabdh mezbaanon ke soochi...pradaan ke jaati hai"".
*   **D:** ""Kabhi-kabhi yaatriyon ko Sthaaniya logo ki sameekshayen pradaan ke jaati hai"" - The passage says lists sometimes include references and reviews from other travelers.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, saajha hostel mein kis prakaar ke yatri milane ki sambhaavana sabase kam hai?","Correct answer is **C: Bachchon ke saath waale parivar**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that seeing families with children in hostels is ""very unlikely"" (""bahut hi namumkin see baat hai""). While some hostels *might* allow them in private rooms, they are generally not the typical clientele.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: bees saal ke umr ke log** - The passage states hostels are *mostly* for people around 20.
*   **B: Akele yatra karne wale log** - Hostels are popular with solo travelers, this isn't mentioned as being rare.
*   **D: bees saal se bde log** - The passage mentions people older than 20 are often seen in hostels.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, aam taur pr hostel me kon log rhte hai?","The correct answer is **B: 22 saal ki umr wale 3 log, jo ek sath yatra kr rhe hai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hostel khaas taur par yuva logon ke liye hote hain. inmein yadatar bees saal ke umr ke log rukte hain."" (Hostels are especially for young people. Mostly people around 20 years old stay in them.)
* Option B directly reflects this - three people around 22 years old traveling together.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bachchon ke saath waale parivar (Families with children):** The passage states families with children are ""bahut hi namumkin"" (very unlikely) to be seen in hostels.
* **C: 70 saal ke km umr ka pariwar (Family under 70 years old):**  The passage doesn't mention any age limit *above* 20.  It focuses on young people.
* **D: Bachchon ke saath waale 2 parivar (2 families with children):** Same reasoning as option A - families with children are rarely found in hostels.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, nimnalikhit mein se kaun sa kathan boomerang phenkane ka sateek varnan karta hai?","The correct answer is **A: Sahi se fekane par yah apke hath me vaapas aa jata hai** (If thrown correctly, it returns to your hand).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that a correct boomerang *should* return to the thrower: ""...aapke paas vaapas aane wala sahi boomerang hona chaahiye."" (you should have the right boomerang that returns).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Yatriyon ki apeksha sthaaniya logo me mashur hunar hai** (This skill is more popular with locals than tourists) - The passage says tourists *want* to learn, not that it's more popular with locals.
*   **C: boomerang Australia mein kam upalabdh hai** (Boomerangs are not readily available in Australia) - The passage says boomerangs are *available* in Australia, but most don't return.
*   **D: Sirf kuch hi boomerang vaapas aate hai** (Only some boomerangs return) - While true that not all do, the passage focuses on needing the *right* kind to return, implying it's possible and the goal.



"
Nimnalikhit mein se kiska upayog mukhya roop se jawa ke vyanjanon mein kiya jaata hai?,"The correct answer is **C: narial chini**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...jawa ke vyanjanon mein pramukh swaad...chini (vishesh roop se jawa ke narial chini)...ka hota hai.""  This translates to ""...Javanese cuisine prominently features the flavor of sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar)...""

Therefore, coconut sugar (narial chini) is specifically mentioned as a key ingredient in Javanese cuisine. The other types of sugar are not highlighted in the text."
"Passage ke hisab se, sankraamak rog kaise phailata hai?","The correct answer is **A: sankramit vyakti dwara** (through an infected person).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sankraamak bimari wah bimari hai jo aas-paas ke **sankramit vyakti** dwara aasaanise failati hai."" This directly translates to ""A contagious disease is one that easily spreads through nearby **infected people**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Rogjanakon se** (through pathogens) - While pathogens *cause* contagious diseases, the passage specifies *how* they spread - through people.
* **C: keetanu se** (through germs) - Similar to pathogens, germs are the cause, not the method of spread mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Vaccine se** (through vaccine) - Vaccines *prevent* contagious diseases, they don't spread them.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Sankraamak bimari kisse nhi hoti?","The correct answer is **A: Vaccine se**.

Here's why:

The passage states that infectious (sankraamak) diseases are caused by things like viruses, germs (keetanu), fungi (fafoond), or parasites. It does *not* mention vaccines as a cause of infectious diseases. In fact, vaccines are used to *prevent* infectious diseases.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: virus:** The passage explicitly states that viruses cause infectious diseases.
*   **C: keetanu:** The passage explicitly states that germs (keetanu) cause infectious diseases.
*   **D: fafoond:** The passage explicitly states that fungi (fafoond) cause infectious diseases."
Kis sthiti mein Vyaktigat VPN pradaata ke bajaay web proxy chunana upayogakarta ke lie paryaapt hoga?,"The correct answer is **C: way kewal http traffic ko dobara routet karna chahte hai**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that VPNs are superior to web proxies *because* they route **all** internet traffic, whereas web proxies only handle HTTP traffic. Therefore, if a user *only* needs to route HTTP traffic, a web proxy would be sufficient.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage states VPNs are better for those who want to route *all* traffic.
*   **B:** The passage mentions VPNs are better for avoiding political control and spying.
*   **D:** The passage states VPNs generally offer more bandwidth and better quality service.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, VPN aur web proxy ke liye inme se kaun sa kathan galat hai?","Sahi jawab hai **D: VPN sirf http trafic ko dobara routet kr skte hai.**

Passage mein saaf-saaf kaha gaya hai ki VPN *saare* internet traffic ko dobara rout karte hain, sirf HTTP traffic ko nahin. Yeh kathan passage ke virudh hai.

Baaki options passage mein diye gaye information ke anurup hain:

*   **A:** Passage mein kaha gaya hai ki VPN aam taur par zyada bandwidth aur behtar gunvatta waali seva pradaan karte hain.
*   **B:** Passage mein kaha gaya hai ki VPN saare internet traffic ko dobara rout karte hain, jabki web proxy sirf HTTP traffic ko.
*   **C:** Passage mein indirectly yeh bataya gaya hai ki VPN ki seva ki gunvatta web proxy se behtar hoti hai."
Aap apne rahne waali jagah ke phone company ka istemal kab kar sakte hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Calls internet par root kiye jaane ke vajah se**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Calls internet par root kiye jaane ke vajah se aapko apne rahne waali jagah yaa yatra karne waale asthan ke phone company ka istemal karne ke zaroorat nahin hoti hai."" (Because calls are routed over the internet, you don't *need* to use the phone company of where you live or travel). The question asks *when* you can avoid using your local phone company, and the passage directly answers that it's when calls are internet-based.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: vaishvik number (global number):** While a global number *allows* calls to reach you, it doesn't negate the need for a phone company if you were relying on a traditional landline.
* **C: satellite (satellite):** Satellite internet is mentioned as a way to *get* internet access, but doesn't explain when you can avoid a local phone company.
* **D: pstn phone (traditional phone):** PSTN phones are the ones this technology is *replacing* in terms of needing a local connection.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, kuch call recieve karne ke liye kya karna hoga?","The correct answer is **A: vaishvik number kharidana hoga** (you will have to buy a global number).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Aksar, aapko alagse ek vaishvik number kharidana hoga jo pstn phone ko aapko call karne ke anumati deta hai."" (Often, you will have to purchase a separate global number that allows a PSTN phone to call you.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: sthaniya ke phone company ka istemal karna hoga** (you will have to use the local phone company) - The passage actually states the opposite: you *don't* need to use the local phone company because of internet-based calling.
*   **C: aap jis samudaay mein rehte hain vahan ka sthaaniya number lena hoga** (you will have to get a local number where you live) - The passage also contradicts this, stating you don't need a local number.
*   **D: pstn phone Kharidana hoga** (you will have to buy a PSTN phone) - The passage says the global number *allows* a PSTN phone to call you; it doesn't say you need to *buy* one.



"
Nimnalikhit mein se kaun Italvi shabdon ke uchchaaran ka sateek varnan nhi karta hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Zyaadaatar shabdon ka uchchaaran unke svar ke aadhaar par bhin hota hai.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the pronunciation of 'c' and 'g' *depends on the following vowel* (nimn swar ke aadhaar par bhin hota hai), not that most words' pronunciation depends on their vowels.  The main point about vowel influence is specifically regarding those two consonants.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: r aur rr ka uchchaaran bhin hai** - The passage explicitly says ""r aur rr ka alag-alag tareekese hi karein"" (r and rr are pronounced differently).
*   **B: zyaadaatar shabdon ka uchchaaran vaise hi kiya jaataa hai jaise unhein likhaa jaataa hai** - This is the opening statement of the passage.
*   **C: c aur g ka uchchaaran kathin ho sakta hai** - The passage says 'c' and 'g' need attention (""Dhyan rakhane vaale mukhya warn c aur g hai"") because their pronunciation varies.  ""Kathin"" (difficult) is a reasonable interpretation of needing attention.



"
Emir ki nimnalikhit mein se kaun si visheshata aadhunik samay se pahale utpann hui thi?,"The correct answer is **D: laal tile vaali chhaten (red tile roofs)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Izmir (Emir) was once the ancient city of Smyrna. Red tile roofs are a traditional architectural feature that dates back to ancient times and were present in Smyrna before the modern developments.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Badey-badey boulevard (Wide boulevards):** These are a product of modern urban planning.
*   **B: glass-fronted imaaraten (Glass-fronted buildings):**  Clearly a modern architectural style.
*   **C: shopping centre (Shopping centers):** A modern commercial development.



"
Nimnalikhit mein se kaun Emir ki sateek visheshata nhi hai?,"सही उत्तर है **B: paaramparik turke ka mahaul hai**।

टेक्स्ट में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि इज़्मिर में भूमध्यसागरीय यूरोप का माहौल अधिक है, पारंपरिक तुर्की संस्कृति की तुलना में। इसलिए, पारंपरिक तुर्की माहौल इज़्मिर की विशेषता नहीं है।

अन्य विकल्प सही हैं क्योंकि:

*   **A: Shahar vishal khadi se ghira hai** - टेक्स्ट में कहा गया है कि इज़्मिर एक विशाल खाड़ी के साथ स्थित है।
*   **C: Aapko aadhunik shopping centre aur purane church dono mil jayege** - टेक्स्ट में आधुनिक शॉपिंग सेंटर और पुरानी मस्जिदों और चर्चों दोनों का उल्लेख है।
*   **D: Yha turke ka doosra sabse bada bandargah hai** - टेक्स्ट में कहा गया है कि इज़्मिर इस्तांबुल के बाद दूसरा सबसे बड़ा बंदरगाह है।"
hanami shabd ka taatpary kis cheez ko dekhne se hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Cherry blossom**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Cherry blossom dekhna hanami kahalaata hai..."" which directly translates to ""Seeing cherry blossoms is called hanami..."" Therefore, hanami means seeing cherry blossoms.



"
Cherry blossom dekhne ke liye pahli paartiyon ki mejabaanee kisne ki?,"The correct answer is **C: Japan ke samrat** (The Emperor of Japan).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Japan mein, pehle cherry blossom parties ko samrat dwara kewal khud aur apne khaas samudaayon ke any sadasyon ke liye imperial nyayalaya ke aspas host kiya jaataa tha.""  This directly translates to: ""In Japan, cherry blossom parties were initially hosted by the emperor for himself and other members of his close community around the imperial court.""

*   **A: Chean ke samrat** (The Emperor of Chean) is incorrect - the text refers to Japan, not Chean.
*   **B: Japani nyayalaya** (Japanese court) is incorrect - the emperor *hosted* the parties *at* the court, but wasn't the court itself hosting.
*   **D: Chean ka nayayalaya** (The court of Chean) is incorrect - again, the context is Japan."
"Passage ke hisab se, Yarushalem ka nimnalikhit mein se kaun sa pahaloo me paryatan ko sabse kam aakarshit karne ki sambhaavana hai?","Sahi jawab **B: irayal ke rajdhani ke roop me** hai.

**Tark:**

Passage mein kahā gaya hai ki adhikansh desh aur sanyukt rashtra Yarushalem ko Israel ki rajdhani ke roop mein maanyata nahin dete hain. Iska matlab hai ki is baat ka vishwas nahi hai, jo paryatan ko kam aakarshit kar sakta hai, kyuki kuchh log iske rajdhani ke status ko manane se inkaar kar sakte hain.

Baaki options sab positive attractions hain:

*   **A: Shahar ka dhaarmik mahatva:** Passage mein bolā gaya hai ki Yarushalem ek aadhyatmik, dhaarmik aur saanskritik kendra hai, jo paryatakon ko aakarshit karta hai.
*   **C: saanskritik kendra ke roop me:** Ye bhi passage mein bataya gaya hai ki yarushalem ek saanskritik kendra hai.
*   **D: kayee aitihaasik sthal hai:** Passage mein kaha gaya hai ki Yarushalem mein kayee aitihaasik aur puratatva sthal hain, jo paryatan ko badhaate hain.

Isliye, options mein se sirf **B** hi ek aisa pahalu hai jo paryatan ko kam aakarshit kar sakta hai."
Nimnalikhit mein se kisaka ullekh passage mein us roop mein nhi kiya gaya hai jisake lie yarushalem jaana jaata hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Rajnitik mahatva**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Yarushalem irayal ke rajdhani hai aur vahaan ka sabse ba shahar hai, haalaanki adhikansh any desh aur sanyukt rashtra ise irayal ke rajdhani ke roop mein maanyata nahin dete hain."" (Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and its largest city, although most other countries and the United Nations do not recognize it as the capital of Israel.) This *acknowledges* its political importance, but doesn't say people *go to Jerusalem* because of its political importance. It frames it as a contested claim.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Roochak itihas** (Fascinating history) - The passage directly mentions ""hazaaron salonse ek lubhavana itihas"" (a fascinating history of thousands of years).
*   **C: dhaarmik mahatva** (Religious importance) - The passage emphasizes that Jerusalem is a spiritual, religious, and cultural center, and that many sites are important for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
*   **D: saanskritik sthal** (Cultural sites) - The passage states Jerusalem has ""kayee aitihaasik, puraatatva aur saanskritik sthal"" (many historical, archaeological, and cultural sites).

**Therefore, the passage doesn’t list political importance as a reason people visit Jerusalem, only as a fact *about* Jerusalem.**"
"Passage ke hisab se, kis prakaar ke yatri ko Wild card khareedne se laabh nhi hoga?","Correct answer is **B: Jo yatri sirf Crugger national park dekhna chahta hai**

Here's why:

The passage states that a Wild Card can be beneficial if you want to visit *selected* or *all* South African National Parks. If someone is only planning to visit Kruger National Park, the Wild Card might not be cost-effective as they'd only be using it for a single park where they would already pay the daily conservation and entrance fees.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jo yatri sabhi sanparks dekhna chahta hai** - The passage explicitly states Wild Card is beneficial for those wanting to see all parks.
*   **C: Jise park dekhne ke liye lagne wale shulk ki chinta ho** - Wild Card helps reduce costs related to park fees.
*   **D: Jo yatri Crugger national park ke sath ek aur park dekhna chahta ho** -  Wild Card is useful for visiting multiple parks, including Kruger.



"
Kaun sa kathan Crugger national park ka sateek varnan nhi karta hai?,"Correct answer is **C: yah dakshin africa ka sabse chhota park hai**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Kruger National Park spans 19,500 square kilometers. This is a large area, so it cannot be the smallest park in South Africa. 

Let's look at why the other options are correct descriptions based on the passage:

*   **A:** The passage explicitly says it's one of South Africa's main attractions.
*   **B:** The passage mentions it has 14 different eco-zones, each with unique wildlife.
*   **D:** The passage states that a Wild Card can be purchased for access to Kruger and other South African national parks.



"
Nimnalikhit mein se kis parvat ke oonche bhaagon mein parvataarohiyon ke liye khatra paida karane ki sambhaavana sabase adhik hai?,"Sahi jawab hai **A: Geele hone par**.

Gyaan ke anushar, kathan mein spasht roop se bataya gaya hai ki geele hone par pathar khatarnak ho jaate hain. Isliye, geele hone par hi parvataarohiyon ko oonche bhaagon mein khatra paida hone ki sambhaavana sabase adhik hai.

Baaki options sahi nahin hain kyonki:

*   **Pathar ke seedhiyaan:** seedhiyaan kathin hain, lekin khatarnak nahin hain.
*   **Chhoti gufa:** gufa kam hai aur nichod hai, lekin isse khatra paida hone ki sambhaavana kam hai.
*   **Steel cable:** steel cable ek sahayak railing hai, jo suraksha pradaan karti hai, khatra nahin."
Nimnalikhit mein se kaun sa kathan passage mein varnit machu pichu parvat ki chadhaai ko sateek roop se nhi btata hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Oonche bhaagon mein khi bhi sahayak railing nhi hai**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""chadhaav waale bhaagon mein steel cable ek sahayak railing pradaan karte hain"" (steel cables provide a supportive railing in the climbing sections). This directly contradicts option B, which claims there are *no* railings.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

*   **A: Fit vyakti ko sans mein takleef hone ke ummid hai** - The passage says ""Itna kahane ke baad, sans mein takleef hone ke ummid rakhein"" (After saying all this, expect to be out of breath).
*   **C: Shirsh ke paas ek chhoti gufa hai jise ooparse guzaaraa jaanaa chaahiye** - The passage mentions ""Shirsh ke paas ek chhoti gufa hai jise ooparse guzaaraa jaanaa chaahiye"" (Near the top is a small cave that must be crawled through).
*   **D: Oonche bhaag geele hone par khatarnak ho jate hai** - The passage warns ""visheshkar jab geele hone, kyonki yah jaldi hi khatarnak ho sakta hai"" (especially when wet, because it can quickly become dangerous).



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inamen se kaun Majercane khana ka mukhya bhojan nhi hai?","Sahi jawab hai **C: Anaaj**.

Passage mein Majercane khane ke mukhya tatvon ke roop mein rotti, sabjiyan aur maans (vishesh roop se suar ka maans) ka zikr hai. Anaaj ka zikr nahi kiya gaya hai.

Isliye, passage ke hisab se anaaj Majercane khana ka mukhya bhojan nahi hai."
"Passage mein di gayi jankari ke aadhaar par, Haingi bhojan ke baare mein kaun sa kathan saty nhi hai?","The correct answer is **B: Garm pathhron ka istemal karne wale haingai wellington me milte hai.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that *some* haingai can be *sampled* in Christchurch and Wellington, but it doesn't say that haingai *using hot stones* are found there. It implies they are primarily found in geothermal areas like Rotorua.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

* **A: Gadde ko pattharonse germ kiya jaataa hai yaa kuch jagahon par bhutapiya garmi swabhavik roop se zameen ke kshetras ko germ banaa detee hai** - This is directly stated in the first sentence.
* **C: Iska istemal aksar paaramparik roast style dinner pakane ke liye kiya jaataa hai** - This is also directly stated in the passage.
* **D: Rotorua mein kayee jagah geothermal haingai pradaan karte hain** - The passage specifically mentions Rotorua as a place with geothermal haingai.



"
Haingai gadde ko garm karne ke vishisht tareeke ke roop mein nimnalikhit mein se kiska ullekh nhi kiya gya hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Gas**.

Here's why:

The passage mentions two methods of heating the earth oven (haingai):

*   **Aug dwara germ pattharonse germ kiya jaataa hai** (heated by hot stones)
*   **Bhutapiya garmi swabhavik roop se zameen ke kshetras ko germ banaa detee hai** (geothermal heat naturally heats areas of the ground)

It **does not** mention the use of gas to heat the oven. The repetition of ""Germ patthar"" in options B and D doesn't change the fact that gas is not mentioned in the passage."
Kisi sadhu yaa nunse vishesh maanyata ka kya parinaam ho sakta hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Chamkile rung ka kapda pahana hai** (Wearing a brightly coloured cloth).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*agar aap apna, vishesh roop se chamkile rung ka kapda laate hain, toh aapko pravesh dwaar par sadhu yaa nunse ek pyaari see muskan milegi.*"" ( ""...if you bring your own, especially brightly coloured cloth, you will receive a sweet smile from the monks or nuns at the entrance."").  This clearly indicates bringing a brightly coloured cloth leads to a positive reaction - a sweet smile - from the monks or nuns, signifying a special acknowledgment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Aapke kandhe bhi dhake hain** (Your shoulders are also covered) - Covering shoulders is a general requirement, not something that earns special recognition.
* **C: Mathon se sir par lapetane ka kapda lia hai** (Taking a cloth to cover your head from the monastery) - This is a common provision for unprepared visitors, not a special act.
* **D: Ghutanon se upar ki skirts pahni hai** (Wearing skirts above the knees) - This is not mentioned in the context of receiving special recognition, and in fact, the passage implies skirts are *required* to cover the knees.



"
Nimnalikhit mein se kaun sa kapda kisi math se lene ke liye upalabdh nhi hai? ,"The correct answer is **B: Shorts**.

Here's why:

The text states:

*   **Women:** Need skirts to cover knees and shoulders, and head coverings are available (or you can bring your own).
*   **Men:** Need trousers to cover knees, available at the entrance.

It explicitly mentions skirts, trousers, and head coverings as being available. It *doesn't* mention shorts at all. Therefore, shorts are the only option not available."
Antarctic kshetron mein jaate samay kisi yatri ko sitaaron ko dekhane ka sabse adhik avasar kab milega?,"The correct answer is **C: Sardiyon mein**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that you experience *dhruviya raat* (polar night) in the Arctic and Antarctic regions during **winter**, which is when the sun doesn't rise above the horizon, creating continuous darkness. This darkness is what allows for optimal stargazing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Garmiyon me (In summer):** Summer has daylight, so it wouldn't be ideal for stargazing.
*   **B: Kshetra mein jansankhya bahut kam ho (Area has very low population):** While a low population helps reduce light pollution, it's not the primary reason for better stargazing.
*   **D: Jab prakash pradooshan kam ho (When light pollution is low):** Low light pollution is a factor, but the passage links prime stargazing to the *darkness of polar night*, which occurs in winter.



"
Satellite phone ko kab sell phone ke asthan par upayog nhi kar sakte?,"The correct answer is **C: Ghar ke baahar rehna par** (When you have to stay outside in the line of sight of the satellite).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**satellite phone ko mobile phone ke asthan par upayog nahin kiya jaa sakta hai, kyonki satellite p hone se call karne ke liye aapko upgrah ke rekha par ghar ke baahar rehna pegaan.**""  (Satellite phones cannot be used in place of mobile phones because to make a call, you have to stay outside in the line of sight of the satellite.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Agar upgrah ke rekha par rukawat hai to** (If there is an obstruction in the satellite's line of sight) - While obstructions *affect* satellite phone use, the passage doesn't say this is *why* they can't replace cell phones.
*   **B: Doorasth asthanon mein** (In remote locations) - The passage *states* that satellite phones are useful in remote locations where cell coverage is unavailable, not that they can't be used *as* a cell phone there.
*   **D: Agar kuchh nishchit data kharch ki aavashyakata hoti hai** (If a certain data cost is required) - Data costs aren't mentioned as a reason they can't replace cell phones.



"
Sell phone ki tulna mein satellite phone kab behtar hoga?,"The correct answer is **D: Sell phone me coverage nahin hone par** (When there is no cell phone coverage).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Doorasth asthanon mein, sell phone coverage nahin honese, ek satellite phone aapka ekmatra vikalp ho sakta hai."" (In remote locations, when there is no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shahar me chhitiyan manate samay** (While celebrating in the city) - Satellite phones are *not* needed in cities where cell phone coverage is readily available.
* **B: Jahaaz par** (On a ship) - The passage mentions shipping companies using them, but this isn't the *primary* reason to choose one. It's a specific use case.  The core reason is lack of cell coverage.
* **C: Jab remote data ki jarurat na ho** (When remote data is not needed) - The passage specifically mentions satellite phones being used for remote data and voice services.



"
Nimnalikhit mein se kis par sangharsh ke kaaran transnistria ganarajya ka nirmaan hua?,"सही उत्तर है: **B: जाatiya sangharsh**

पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से उल्लेख किया गया है कि ""Moldova ek bahu jaatiya ganarajya hai, jo jaatiya sangharshse peedit rahaa hai."" और ""1994 mein, is sangharsh ke vajah se purvi maldova mein transnistria ganarajya ke nirmaan ghoshana hui."" 

इसलिए, जातीय संघर्ष के कारण ही ट्रांसनिस्ट्रिया गणराज्य का निर्माण हुआ।"
Transnistria ganarajya mein nimnalikhit mein se kaun sa hissa moldova ke baaki hisson se alag hai?  ,"सही उत्तर है **C: संयुक्त राष्ट्र की मान्यता**।

पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि ट्रांसनिस्ट्रिया गणराज्य की अपनी सरकार और मुद्रा है, लेकिन इसे संयुक्त राष्ट्र के किसी भी सदस्य देश ने मान्यता नहीं दी है। यही वह चीज़ है जो इसे मोल्दोवा के बाकी हिस्सों से अलग करती है।

अन्य विकल्प गलत क्यों हैं:

*   **A: भाषा:** पाठ में कहा गया है कि मोल्दोवा में रूसी भाषा का व्यापक रूप से उपयोग किया जाता है, और ट्रांसनिस्ट्रिया में भी रूसी भाषा का उपयोग होने की संभावना है।
*   **B: धर्म:** पाठ में कहा गया है कि मोल्दोवा में रूढ़िवादी ईसाई धर्म प्रमुख है, और ट्रांसनिस्ट्रिया में भी यही धर्म होने की संभावना है।
*   **D: मुद्रा:** पाठ में कहा गया है कि ट्रांसनिस्ट्रिया की अपनी मुद्रा है, लेकिन इससे यह मोल्दोवा के बाकी हिस्सों से अलग नहीं होता है।"
Passage ke anusaar yatri ko hawa ke mausam se bachne ke liye Montevideo kab jaana chahiye?,"The correct answer is **A: Uttari golardh ke sardi ke mahino mein** (During the winter months of the Northern Hemisphere).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Choonki montevideo bhumadhya rekha ke dakshin mein hai, isliye uttari golardh mein sardiyon ke dauran vahan garmi hoti hai aur iske vipareet bhi hota hai."" (Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is warm there during the winter months of the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.)

The question asks when to visit to *avoid* bad weather. The passage implies that Montevideo experiences warmth when the Northern Hemisphere is in winter. Therefore, going during the Northern Hemisphere's winter months would mean enjoying warmer temperatures in Montevideo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Montevideo ke sookhe ke mausam mein:** The passage explicitly states that Montevideo doesn't have a ""dry"" season.
* **C: Uttari golardh ke garmi ke mahino mein:** This would be Montevideo's winter, which the passage implies is *not* the ideal time to go.
* **D: Montevideo ke sardi ke mahino mein:** The passage describes Montevideo's winter as potentially feeling colder due to wind and humidity, even if temperatures don't drop below freezing.



"
Passage ke anusaar yatri agar thand ke aadi nahi hain to unhe Montevideo kab jaana chahiye?,"The correct answer is **A: Jab Montevideo mein garmi hoti hai**

Here's why:

The passage states that Montevideo experiences warmth during the northern hemisphere's winter (""Choonki montevideo bhumadhya rekha ke dakshin mein hai, isliye uttari golardh mein sardiyon ke dauran vahan garmi hoti hai..."").  It also mentions that Montevideo's summers are generally hot (+30deg C). 

If a traveler is not used to the cold, they should visit when it's *warm* in Montevideo. Options B, C and D involve cold seasons, making them unsuitable choices.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, inmein se kya sampatti ke saath barbarta ke bajaay ek sthaapit bhiitichitra kalakar se juda maana jaayega?","The correct answer is **A: Bhittichitra karyakram** (Mural programs).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""आजकल स्थापित भित्तिचित्र कलाकार, भित्तिचित्र कार्यक्रम और """"वैध"""" दीवारें उपलब्ध हैं।"" (Nowadays, established mural artists, mural programs and ""legal"" walls are available.)  This directly links mural programs with established artists and a legitimate form of art, *not* vandalism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Aspasht likhaavat** (Illegible writings/scribbles): The passage associates this with the more negative, unwanted aspect of graffiti.
* **C: Sarvjanik sampatti par anchaahe chitra** (Unwanted pictures on public property): This is described as the common, often illegal, association with graffiti.
* **D: Avaidh tags** (Illegal tags): This is explicitly linked to vandalism.



"
Musical festival mein shaamil hone waale logon ke liye unka sabse aham hissa kya hai?,"Correct answer is **B: Us jagah par camp lagaana**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...*zyaadaatar log ise apne anubhav ka ahem hissa maante hain*."" (most people consider it an important part of their experience). This directly refers to camping at the festival grounds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chhote bachchon ke saath aana** - The passage mentions family camping areas, but doesn't say it's the *most* important part for most people.
*   **C: Der raat tak music chalana** - While mentioned, it's a feature *of* the festival, not the core experience for attendees.
*   **D: Jaldi pahunchna** - This is a *strategy* to get a good camping spot, not the experience itself.



"
Passage ke anusaar festival mein aane waale adhiktar ko kya karna chahiye taaki wo music ke paas camp laga sake?,"The correct answer is **D: Jaldi pahunchna** (Arrive early).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Agar aap action ke nazdeek rehna chahte hain toh aapko music ke nazdeek vaali camping site par **jaldise jaldi pahunchana** hoga."" This directly translates to ""If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive at the camping site near the music **as early as possible**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Der raat ko jaana** (Go late at night) - The passage implies the opposite; you need to arrive *early* to get the best spots.
*   **B: Parivaaron waale ilaakon mein rukna** (Stay in family areas) - The passage mentions family areas exist, but doesn't say this is how to camp near the music.
*   **C: Off-site camp lagana** (Camp off-site) - The passage focuses on camping *at* the festival grounds, close to the music.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, paryatakon ko uttari New Mexico mein nighlife dekhne ke liye kisse bachna chahiye?","The correct answer is **B: Chhote sheharon ke sharaabkhaane (Small town bars)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Khabardar: yahaan ke chhote kasbon ke madhushala hamesha baaharse aye paryatakon ke ghoomane ke liye acchi jagah nahin hai."" (Beware: the taverns of the small towns here are not always a good place for tourists to roam.)

The passage also warns about the increased risk of drunk drivers near these bars.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nagar (Cities)** - The passage says you won't find much nightlife *without* visiting Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
*   **C: Malls** - Malls are not mentioned in the passage concerning nightlife.
*   **D: Casinos** - The passage states that casinos *do* offer entertainment, even bringing in name-brand entertainment.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, paryatakon ko uttari New Mexico mein mashhoor manoranjan ki jagahen kahan zyada mil sakti hain?","The correct answer is **A: Albuquerque se do ghante ki doori par Casino mein**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...लगभग सभी casino पेय देते हैं, और उनमंसे कई नाम-brand मनोरंजन (मख्य रूप से बड़े Albuquerque और Santa Fay के आसपास के बड़े वाले) लेकर आते हैं।"" This translates to ""...almost all casinos serve drinks, and many bring name-brand entertainment (mainly the larger ones around Albuquerque and Santa Fe).""  It also implies these casinos are within a couple of hours of Albuquerque.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Door ke nagar mein** - The passage says nightlife is *limited* outside of larger cities.
*   **C: Sante Fe ke paas Casino mein** - While Santa Fe has casinos, the passage highlights casinos around *both* Albuquerque and Santa Fe.
*   **D: Chhote shehar ke sharaabkhaane mein** - The passage *warns against* relying on small-town bars for entertainment and highlights the dangers associated with them.



"
Paise bachane waale paryatak is tarah ke pey se bachna chahenge?,"The correct answer is **D: Falon ka juice**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""falon ka juice mahanga hai lekin bahut achcha hai."" (Fruit juice is expensive but very good).  

A tourist wanting to save money would avoid expensive items. The other options are either cheaper (local beer, tap water) or not explicitly mentioned as expensive (bottled water, New Zealand/Australian wine are *suggested* as better, not pricier).

Therefore, **fruit juice** is the item a budget-conscious traveler would likely avoid."
"Passage mein bataye gaye ilaake ke anusaar, inmein se kaunsa pey sever ko uljhan mein daal sakta hai?","The correct answer is **D: Flat white**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Australia ke logon ke liye, 'flat white' coffee ka vichaar videshi hai."" (For Australians, the idea of 'flat white' coffee is foreign.) This means an Australian server would likely be confused by an order for a flat white.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Short black:** The passage explains what a short black is (""short blek 'espresso' hai"") - it's a simple espresso.
*   **B: Number one:** ""Mukhya local bear 'number one' hai"" refers to a local beer and wouldn't cause confusion for a server.
*   **C: New Zealand se Sauvignon Blanc:** The passage suggests New Zealand wine *might be better* than local French wine, but doesn't imply it would be confusing to order. It is a type of wine readily available.



"
"Teen sadiyon tak chala, upnivesh ka daur kis samooh ne shuru kiya tha?","The correct answer is **D: Spaniards**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Spen ke logonne upanivesh call ke shuruat ke, jo teen shataabdiyon tak jaari rahaa."" This translates to ""The Spanish people started the colonial period, which lasted for three centuries.""

Therefore, the Spanish initiated the three-century colonial period.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, Paris ke nivasi se ghulne milne ka sabse achchha tareeka kya hai?","The correct answer is **A: Paris ke nivasi ke vyavhar ki nakal karna**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""paris mein ghulane-milane ka sabse achcha tarika abhi bhi apna sabse achcha vyavhaar karna hai, kisi aise vyakti ke tarah abhinaya karna jo """"bien alev"""" (achchi tarah se palla-badha) ho.""  This directly translates to ""the best way to mingle in Paris is still to act like someone who is 'well-bred' (i.e., like a Parisian).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Aatmvishvas dikhana (Show confidence):** While confidence can be helpful generally, the passage doesn't emphasize it as the *best* way to blend in.
* **C: Vinamra rehna (Be humble):** The passage *implies* good manners, but it's about mimicking Parisian behavior, not just general humility.  The initial statement even challenges the perception of Parisians as humble.
* **D: Ghulne milne waala bartaav karna (Act like someone who blends in):** This is too vague. The passage specifies *how* to blend in - by adopting the mannerisms of Parisians.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, inmein se kya paris ke nivasiyon ki aam aadat nahi hai?","The passage states that it is **often a false stereotype** that Parisians are arrogant (ahankari), uncivil (asabhya), and proud (abhimani).  It doesn't mention shokhi (cheekiness) or achanak kuch kar dena (suddenly doing something/impulsiveness) as characteristics associated with Parisians, either positively or negatively.

Therefore, the answer is **C: Shokhi**.  The passage focuses on debunking the negative stereotypes, and doesn't introduce a positive one like cheekiness.



"
Cape Town ki Metro Rail ki pratham shreni ka faayda kya hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Zyada log nahi hote**.

Here's why:

* The passage states ""Metroplus zyada aramdayak aur kam bhid wala hota hai"" which translates to ""Metroplus is more comfortable and less crowded"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dabba train ke aage hota hai** - The passage states the Metro Plus carriage is *behind* (towards Cape Town) not in front.
* **C: Yeh teesri shreni ke ticket se kum daam ka hota hai** - The passage says it's *more expensive* than the regular ""third class"" metro ticket.
* **D: Yeh metroticket ke daam ka hota hai** - The passage states it is cheaper than European metro tickets, but doesn't compare it to regular metro tickets within Cape Town.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, Cape Town ki har local train mein kya hota hai?","Correct answer is **D: Dono pehli aur teesri shreni ke dabbe**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""har train mein metro plus aur metro dabbe hote hain"" which translates to ""each train has both Metro Plus and Metro compartments."" Metro Plus is first class and Metro is third class.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kum bheed waala dabba (Less crowded compartment)** - While Metro Plus is *less* crowded, the passage doesn't say *every* train has a less crowded compartment.
*   **B: Dono shreniyon ke liye ticket ka ek daam (One ticket price for both classes)** - The passage says Metro Plus is *more expensive* than Metro, meaning different prices.
*   **C: Teen alag shreniyan (Three separate classes)** - The passage only mentions two classes: Metro Plus and Metro.



"
Inmein se kya jaanvaron ke keede nahi karte?,"The correct answer is **D: Gambhir chot lagna (Serious injury)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Sankraamak beemariyan, yaa khatarnak janwar jo ball dwara logon ko ghayal yaa maar sakte hain, aam taur par keat nahin maane jaate hain."" (Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people through bites, are generally not considered pests.)

This means serious injuries caused by dangerous animals are *not* something pests typically do.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kharonch maarna (Scratching):** Insects and pests *can* scratch (think fleas, mites, etc.).
*   **B: Allergy karna (Causing allergies):** The passage explicitly mentions pests causing allergies.
*   **C: Sankraman karna (Causing infections):** The passage explicitly mentions pests spreading infections.



"
Prepaid phone cards ko kahan khareeda jaa sakta hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Kone ki dukaanon par** (at corner stores).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""P: har koney ki dukan pre-paid phone card ke ek bhraamak kataar se bhar jaati hai..."" which translates to ""P: Every corner store is filled with a huge variety of prepaid phone cards...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Khaas deshon mein** (in specific countries) - The passage doesn't say *where* they are bought, just that some cards are good for calls to specific countries.
*   **B: Train stations par** (at train stations) -  The passage doesn't mention train stations.
*   **D: Pay phones par** (at pay phones) - The passage says the cards are *used with* pay phones, not bought at them.



"
Kuch cards dwara behtar call darein kaise mil sakti hain?,"The correct answer is **B: Toll-free numbers se**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""in sevaaon tak aksar ek toll-free telephone number ke madad se pahunch jaataa hai jise binaa kisi shulk ke adhikansh phone se call kiya jaa sakta hai."" (These services are often accessed via a toll-free telephone number which can be called from most phones without charge). This directly indicates that toll-free numbers are how you access the better call rates offered by some cards.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Khaas deshon meon hi mil sakti hain (Only available in specific countries):** The passage doesn't say the cards themselves are only available in specific countries, it says *some* cards offer better rates *to* specific countries.
*   **C: Kone ki dukaan par (At the corner store):** The corner store is where you *buy* the cards, but not how you access better rates.
*   **D: Pay phone ka isteymaal karke aur kuch atirikt shulk dekar (By using a pay phone and paying an additional fee):** The passage does not mention any extra fees or needing to use payphones specifically to get better rates.



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, Plitvice Lakes national park mein inmein se kaunsa ped kum paaya jaata hai?","The correct answer is **B: Oak**.

The passage states that Plitvice National Park is surrounded by jungle mainly featuring **beach (likely meaning beech), spruce and fir trees**. It doesn't mention oak trees at all. Therefore, oak is the tree least found in Plitvice Lakes National Park according to the passage."
Inmein se kaunsa durlabh jeev-jantu Plitvice Lakes national park mein mil sakta hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Capercaillie**.

The passage specifically mentions ""durlabh jeev-jantu jaise ki european bhura bhalu, bhediya, eagle, ullu, vanbilav, jangli billi aur **capercaillie** bhi mill sakte hain."" (rare animals like European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and capercaillie can also be found).

The other options (Turkey, Honey Badger, Cassowary) are not mentioned in the passage."
"Passage ke anusaar, sthaniye codes kis cheez mein madad karte hain?","Correct answer is **B: Bazaar ko niyatran mein rakhne**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the *real* purpose of media companies claiming to fight piracy with regional codes is ""to give those companies more control over their markets.""  The codes don't actually stop copying, they just allow companies to restrict *where* copies can be played, thus controlling the market.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Disk ko copy karne mein:** The passage says regional codes don't stop copying.
*   **C: Piracy rokne mein:** The passage claims the companies are *lying* about preventing piracy.
*   **D: Avaidh nakal mein:** The passage states regional codes have no impact on illegal copying.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, media companiyon dwara sthaniye codes ke baare mein kya jhooth bola jaata hai?","Correct answer: **B: Inse avaidh nakal roki jaa sakti hai**

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that media companies ""regularly lie about this objective [stopping piracy]"" and that ""local code has no effect on illegal copying.""  They *claim* the codes stop piracy, but the passage argues this is a falsehood.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bazaar par adhik niyantran ke liye ye zaroori hain** - While the passage *says* the true goal is market control, it doesn't say the companies lie *that* this is why the codes are needed. It says they lie about the codes stopping piracy.
* **C: Paise ki kataai mein aham hai** - The passage identifies the codes as a method of ""money extraction,"" but it doesn’t say the companies falsely claim the codes *are* the money extraction method.
* **D: Inse piracy durlabh hi roki jaa sakti hai** - The passage completely denies the codes have *any* effect on piracy.  It doesn't suggest even a limited effect.



"
"Apni matrbhoomi mein aane par, kaunsi baat anaupcharik hoti hai?","The correct answer is **A: Immigration checks**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jab aap apni matribhoomi mein aate hain, toh immigration check **aam taur par nahin hota yaa aupchaarik hota hai**..."" which translates to ""When you come to your homeland, immigration checks are **usually not done or are informal**...""

The passage highlights that immigration checks are *less* strict or formal upon returning to one's homeland. The other options (declaring goods, legal limits, customs control) are described as potential issues or things to be aware of, not as things that are typically informal."
Apni matrbhoomi mein aate samay aapko inmein se kya pata hona chahiye?,"The correct answer is **B: Kya kanuni seema se upar ka samaan batana hoga** (Whether you need to declare goods exceeding the legal limit).

Here's why:

The passage directly states: ""Sunishchit karein ki aap jaante hain ki aap under kya la sakte hain aur kya nahin la sakte hain aur kanuni seema se adhik kuch bhi ho, toh use ghoshit karein."" (Make sure you know what you can bring and what you can't, and declare anything exceeding the legal limit).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Kya immigration chauki hogi** (Will there be an immigration checkpoint): The passage says immigration *generally* isn't strict, so knowing *if* there's a checkpoint isn't the primary focus.
*   **C: Kya seema shulk niyantran hoga** (Will there be customs control): The passage states customs control *can* be a problem, but the important thing is knowing the rules and declaring items.
*   **D: Kya aapke dwara laye gaye kisi samaan ko anumati nahi hai** (Whether some of the goods you bring are prohibited): While true you need to know what's allowed, the passage specifically emphasizes declaring *excess* goods, not just prohibited items.

Therefore, the most important piece of information, according to the passage, is whether you need to declare goods that exceed the legal limit."
"Passage ke anusaar, kis cheez ki bahutayat se parvatarohiyon ko Cochamó Valley mein naye raaste milte rehte hain?","सही उत्तर है **D: deewaaren**।

Passage स्पष्ट रूप से कहता है कि ""दुनिया भर के पर्वतारोही इसकी दीवारों की अनगिनत संभावनाओं के बीच लगातार नए-नए रास्ते बना रहे हैं।"" इसलिए, पर्वतारोहियों को Cocamó Valley में नए रास्ते खोजने की प्रेरणा दीवारों की विविधता और चुनौती से मिलती है।

अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि:

*   **A: Nazare (नज़ारे)** - नज़ारे खूबसूरत हैं, लेकिन passage यह नहीं बताता कि वे नए रास्तों को खोजने का कारण हैं।
*   **B: Shikhar (शिखर)** - passage में शिखर का उल्लेख है, लेकिन यह नहीं बताया गया कि वे नए रास्तों के लिए महत्वपूर्ण हैं।
*   **C: Chotiyan (चोटियाँ)** - चोटियाँ नज़ारों के लिए जिम्मेदार हैं, रास्तों के लिए नहीं।"
"Passage ki jaankari ke anusaar, dakshini golardh mein sabse zyada crossings kaun cover karta hai?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Star Alliance... includes everything from Santiago, Chile to Tahiti, except the eastern South Pacific"". This means Star Alliance covers the most ocean crossings in the Southern Hemisphere, albeit with one exception.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: SkyTeam:** The passage explicitly states that SkyTeam doesn't cover *any* of the three major ocean crossings.
*   **C: South Pacific:** This is a geographical region, not an airline alliance.
*   **D: LATAM Oneworld:** While LATAM Oneworld offers a flight from Santiago to Tahiti, the passage states this is *one* option, not the alliance with the most crossings overall.

"
Dakshini golardh mein kaunsi airline sabse kum crossings cover karti hai?,"Correct answer: **D: SkyTeam**

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states: ""कोई भी airline गathbandhan dakshini golardh mein sabhi teen mahasagar crossing ko cover nahin karta hai (aur sky team inmein se koi bhi cover nahin karti hai)."" This means SkyTeam covers the fewest oceanic crossings in the Southern Hemisphere.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Star Alliance:** The passage states Star Alliance covers everything *except* the East South Pacific route. This means it covers more than SkyTeam.
*   **B: South Pacific:** This isn't mentioned as an airline alliance in the passage, so we can't determine its coverage.
*   **C: LATAM Oneworld:** The passage specifically mentions LATAM Oneworld as offering a specific route (Santiago to Tahiti) which means they cover *some* crossings, and therefore don't cover the fewest.



"
Kis sangathan ne Global Running Tours mein safalta paayi?,"The correct answer is **B: Go Running Tours**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Global running tours ke uttaradhikari, **go running tours** chaar mahadweepon par darjanon drishti se chalane waale pradaata hain."" (The successors to Global Running Tours, **Go Running Tours** operate on four continents with dozens of providers.)

This directly indicates that Go Running Tours followed and succeeded Global Running Tours. The other options are locations *where* Go Running Tours operates, not the organization itself.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, Go Running Tours kitne drishti se chalne waale sangathano ko jodne mein madad karte hain?","The correct answer is **C: Darjanon** (Dozens).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Global running tours ke uttaradhikari, go running tours chaar mahadweepon par **darjanon** drishti se chalane waale pradaata hain.""  This directly translates to ""The successors of Global running tours, Go Running Tours are operators running in **dozens** across four continents.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chaar (Four):** While they operate *across* four continents, they connect *dozens* of operators.
*   **B: 200:** The passage mentions 200 tour organizations in total, but not the number Go Running Tours connects.
*   **D: Teen (Three):** The passage doesn't mention three. It specifies dozens.



"
Paryatak ko cheetah sabse saaf tareeke se dekhne ke liye kya karna chahiye?,"The correct answer is **C: Doorbeen ka istemaal** (Use binoculars).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kabhi-kabhi sher, chite aur tendue sharmile hote hain. aap unhein doorbeen ke zariye achchi tarah se dekh paayenge."" (Sometimes lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy. You can see them well through binoculars.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hiking safari par jaana** (Go on a hiking safari) - While hiking safaris exist, the passage doesn't specifically connect them to *seeing cheetahs* clearly.
* **B: Bush walk par jaana** (Go on a bush walk) -  Similar to hiking safari, it's a type of safari but doesn't guarantee a good view of cheetahs.
* **D: Car len aur maanak upkaran istemaal karen** (Take a car and use standard equipment) - This is mentioned for elephants and giraffes, not specifically cheetahs which are described as shy.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, safari mein vaahan mein aagantuko ko kis tarah ka janwar dekhne ko mil sakta hai?","The correct answer is **B: Giraffes**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Haathi aur jiraaf jaise kuch janwar, karon ke bahut karib chale aate hain aur maanak upkaran se achcha nazara dikhai dega.""  This translates to ""Some animals like elephants and giraffes come very close to the cars and can be seen well with normal equipment.""

While lions, leopards, and cheetahs *are* mentioned, the passage specifically says giraffes come close to the vehicles, making it the most likely animal to be seen by visitors in a safari vehicle.  It also states those other animals are often shy and require binoculars to spot.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, tour ki keemat kisse kum hogi?","The correct answer is **D: Chh ya zyada logon ka samuh khojkar**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Badey samoohon ke liye yaatraaein sastee ho jaati hain, isliye agar aap akele yaa sirf kisi ek dost ke saath yatra karte hain, toh us yatra mein chaar se chhah logon ko jodne ki koshish karein, taaki aapko prati vyakti ke hisaab se padne wala kharch kam ho jaye.""  This directly translates to ""Travel becomes cheaper for larger groups, therefore if you travel alone or with just one friend, try to connect four to six people to your trip so that the cost per person decreases.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Khud jaakar (Going yourself):** The passage doesn't say going alone is cheaper.
*   **B: Chaar logon ka samuh khojkar (Finding a group of four):** While better than traveling alone, the passage suggests aiming for *four to six* to significantly lower costs.
*   **C: Kisi ek aur vyakti ke saath jaakar (Going with one other person):** The passage specifically suggests adding more than just one other person.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, kise sasbe achchhi tour ki dar milegi?","The passage states that travel becomes cheaper for larger groups. It suggests trying to join 4-6 people to your trip if you're traveling alone or with just one friend to reduce per-person costs.

Therefore, the answer is **D: Paanch ka samuh (A group of five)**. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Paryatak jo car badal sakte hain (Tourists who can change cars):** The passage mentions being packed into cars as a potential overcharge tactic, not a way to get a good deal.
*   **B: Teen ka samuh (A group of three):** While better than traveling alone, it's not the ideal size mentioned for cost savings (4-6 people).
*   **C: Saath yatra kar rahe do dost (Two friends traveling together):** The passage specifically suggests *adding* people to this scenario to lower costs."
"Passage ke anusaar, San Francisco ko duniya bhar mein mashur kisne kiya?","The correct answer is **A: Kala aur media ke kai prakaaron ka hona** (The presence of various types of art and media).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sangeet, films, saahitya aur lokpriya sanskriti ke lagaatar prastuti karan shahar aur iski khaas jagahon ko duniya bhar mein mashur karne mein madad ki hai.""  This directly translates to ""The constant presentation of music, films, literature and popular culture has helped to make the city and its unique places famous around the world.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sarvottam sammelan ki suvidhayen** (Excellent conference facilities) - While these contribute to the economy, the passage doesn't say they made the city famous.
*   **C: Aarthik vividhta** (Economic diversity) - This is a characteristic of San Francisco's economy but doesn't explain its global fame.
*   **D: Ubharta hua Asian vyanjan drishya** (Emerging Asian cuisine scene) - The passage mentions San Francisco having great Asian cuisine, but says it contributed to the economy, not the city's fame.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, San Francisco ke baare mein inmein se kaunsi baat sahi nahi hai?","Correct answer is **D: Arthvyavastha poori tarah paryatan par nirbhar hai**.

Here's why:

The passage states that San Francisco's economy is *linked* to attracting tourists, but it also explicitly mentions *diversity* in the economy. The passage lists other major sectors like professional services, government jobs, finance, and trade.  This means the economy is *not* solely dependent on tourism.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Yeh kai baar movies aur books mein dikhaya gaya hai:** The passage mentions ""Sangeet, films, saahitya aur lokpriya sanskriti ke lagaatar prastuti karan shahar aur iski khaas jagahon ko duniya bhar mein mashur karne mein madad ki hai"" - this implies it's featured in films and books.
*   **B: Asian pakwan prachlan mein hain:** The passage specifically says San Francisco is among the best places for Asian cuisine (Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese).
*   **C: Kai hotels aur sammelan kendra hain:** The passage states ""San Francisco ne kayee hotel, restaurant, aur sarvottam sammelan ke suvidhaon ke saath ek bada paryatak buniyaadi dhancha viksit kiya hai."""
"Passage ke anusaar, travel agent ki sevaon ka kis tarah ka yatri faayda nahi utha sakta?","The correct answer is **B: Achanak kuch karne wala yatri (A spontaneous traveler)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes planning and pre-booking.** It highlights the peace of mind that comes with *pahle se booking* (booking in advance) and the ability to take time for things like visa applications through reservations.
* A spontaneous traveler, by definition, doesn't plan ahead.  They make decisions on the fly. The passage strongly suggests travel agents are most helpful for those who *need* time to think, plan, and prepare.
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **A: Faisla na le sakne waala yatri (Indecisive traveler):** The passage mentions the ability to take time to *think about offers*, so an indecisive traveler would benefit.
    * **C: Jis yatri ne abtak apna visa surakshit na kiya ho (Traveler who hasn't secured their visa yet):**  The passage specifically states agents can help with obtaining documents like visas through reservation holding.
    * **D: Jis yatri ko package deals pasand hon (Traveler who likes package deals):** The passage mentions travel agents *offer* package deals.

**Therefore, a spontaneous traveler who doesn't plan ahead is the type of traveler who would likely find the least benefit from using a travel agent, as described in the passage.**



"
Passage mein inmein se kya travel agent se booking karne ka faayda nahi bataya gaya hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Yatra ke dastavezo mein jaldi (Quickly getting travel documents)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Agar aap offer ke baare mein sochne yaa destination ke liye document (jaise visa) paane ke liye samay chahte hain, toh way aapko reservation ki suvidha bhi de sakte hain."" This means travel agents can *help* you with time to get documents, but doesn't say they *speed up* the process of getting them.
* **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    * **B: Hotel deals:** ""...travel agent ke paas aksar kuch khaas hotels ki deal hoti hain...""
    * **C: Sab kuch shaamil karne waale packages:** ""...travel agent aise package offer karte hain, jinmein nashta, hawai adde aane-jaane ke vyavastha yaa hawai yatra ke ticket ke saath-saath hotel ka kiraya bhi shamil hota hai.""
    * **D: Reservation rakhna:** ""...way aapko reservation ki suvidha bhi de sakte hain.""

Therefore, getting travel documents quickly is not a benefit of booking through a travel agent mentioned in the passage."
"Passage ke anusaar, Real-time text translator apps kya nahi kar sakti?","The correct answer is **D: 100% baar sahi anuvaad karna** (100% accurate translation every time).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...ab bhi mumkin hai ki sub kuch galat ho raha ho"" (it's still possible that everything is going wrong) and ""...ab aksar lagbhag sahi anuvaad kiye jaate hain"" (now often approximately correct translations are done). This indicates that while translation engines have improved, they are *not* perfect and can still make mistakes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Videshi bhasha ke sandesh ka anuvaad karna** (Translating messages in foreign languages) - The apps *can* do this, it's their primary function.
*   **B: Poore text khand ka anuvaad karna** (Translating entire text segments) - The passage explicitly states they *can* translate entire segments of text.
*   **C: Cheezon par maujood text ka smartphone se anuvaad karna** (Translating text present on objects with a smartphone) - The passage states some apps can do this using the phone's camera.



"
Offline anuvaad kisse hote hain?,"The correct answer is **C: Bhasha ka data download karna** (Downloading language data).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""google translate hai, jo man chaahi bhasha data download karne ke baad offline anuvaad karne deta hai.""  This directly means offline translation is enabled *by* downloading the language data.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Behtar anuvaad engines (Better translation engines):** While better engines *help* with translation, they don't *enable* offline translation.
* **B: Smartphones:** Smartphones are the *device* used, but not what makes offline translation possible.
* **D: Real-time anuvaad shreni mein applications (Applications in the real-time translation category):** This is a general category, not the specific requirement for offline use.



"
Inmein se kya Himaskhalan ka trigger nahi hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Chipchipi barf**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*iski vajah se barf atirikt hissa him askhalan ke roop mein niche khisak jaataa hai. Samasya yah hai ki barf chipchipi hai, isliye ise niche aane ke liye kuch triggering ke aavashyakta hoti hai...*"".  

This means that *sticky* (chipchipi) snow **needs** a trigger to slide. It isn't a trigger *itself*.

The passage explicitly lists these as triggers:

*   **Manav** (Humans)
*   **Dhoop** (Sun/Heat)
*   **Atirikt barfbari** (Additional snowfall)

Therefore, sticky snow is the factor that *requires* a trigger, not *is* a trigger.



"
Passage ke anusaar inmein se kya himaskhalan ki tarah neeche aata hai?,"सही उत्तर है **C: खड़ी चढ़ाई पर ज़्यादा बर्फ**।

यहाँ कारण दिया गया है:

पैराग्राफ स्पष्ट रूप से बताता है कि हिमस्खलन तब होता है जब खड़ी ढलान पर बर्फ की पकड़ ढीली हो जाती है, और अतिरिक्त बर्फ हिमस्खलन के रूप में नीचे खिसक जाती है। यह 'खड़ी चढ़ाई पर ज़्यादा बर्फ' की स्थिति का वर्णन करता है।

अन्य विकल्प क्यों गलत हैं:

*   **A: चिपचिपी बर्फ जो ट्रिगर न हुई हो:** पैराग्राफ में कहा गया है कि चिपचिपी बर्फ को नीचे आने के लिए एक ट्रिगर की आवश्यकता होती है। ट्रिगर के बिना, यह नहीं खिसकेगी।
*   **B: बिना बर्फ वाली खड़ी चढ़ाई:** हिमस्खलन के लिए बर्फ का होना आवश्यक है।
*   **D: लोगों द्वारा छुई गई बर्फ:** पैराग्राफ में यह बताया गया है कि मनुष्य अक्सर ट्रिगरिंग घटना होते हैं, लेकिन हिमस्खलन की वजह केवल बर्फ को छूना नहीं है।"
"Passage ke anusaar, kya cheezen curry ki aadhar hain?","The correct answer is **B: Jadi-bootiyan aur masale**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Curry ek aisaa vyanjan hai jise **maans ya sabziyon saath jadi-bootiyan aur masale** milakar banaaya jaataa hai."" (Curry is a dish made by mixing **herbs and spices** with meat or vegetables).

The passage describes *ingredients* that are added *to* curry, but the fundamental basis of curry *is* the combination of herbs and spices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dahi aur paani (Yogurt and water):** While yogurt (dahi) is used in some curries, and water is often used to adjust consistency, they are not the core foundation.
*   **C: Nariyal ka dhoodh aur maans (Coconut milk and meat):**  Coconut milk is a regional addition, and meat is *with* the curry, not *of* it.
*   **D: Sabziyan aur dhoodh (Vegetables and milk):**  Similar to meat, vegetables are ingredients *in* a curry, and milk isn't a defining base.



"
"Kuch ilaakon mein, kiski jagah nariyal ke doodh ka istemaal kiya jaata hai?","The correct answer is **C: Dahi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Uttari Bharat aur Pakistan ke antardeshiya kshetron mein aam taur par dahi ka upayog curry mein kiya jaataa hai; dakshini bharat mein aur upmahadweep ke kuch anya tateeya kshetron mein aam taur par nariyal ke doodh ka upayog kiya jaataa hai."" 

This translates to: ""In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt (dahi) is commonly used in curry; in South India and some other coastal regions of the Indian subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.""

Therefore, coconut milk is used *instead of* yogurt (dahi) in certain regions.



"
Pahadi maidan tak aane ke liye Transantarctic parvaton ke chaaro ore ek lamba chakkar kyu lagana padta hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Vishesh tractors tez nahi hote**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a long detour around the Transantarctic Mountains is necessary ""because you can't travel very quickly on it.""  This is directly linked to the fact that only specialized tractors pulling sleds can traverse the route, and these tractors are not fast.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: McMurdo Station aksar band rehta hai** - The passage doesn't mention the station being closed.
* **B: Thos barf khatarnak hoti hai** - While the ice is described as thick, the passage doesn't focus on its danger as the *reason* for the detour. It's more about the *speed* of travel.
* **D: Ross samudra se yatra ki tulna mein ye aasaan hai** - This is the opposite of what the passage implies.  The route is difficult, requiring a long detour.



"
Dakshini dhruv par jhando se kya chinhit hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Barf se bhare himvider**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...yah daraaren bhari hui aur **jhande dwara chihnit thos barf** hai."" (This is filled with crevasses and **solid ice marked by flags**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: McMurdo Station par trail** - The passage mentions McMurdo Station as the starting point, but doesn't say the trail is *marked* there.
*   **B: Tel le jaate tractors** - Tractors *use* the route, but aren't what is marked on it.
*   **D: Parvaton ke chaaro ore khatarnaak ghuamav** - The passage mentions a long route around the mountains, but it's the ice itself that is marked with flags.



"
Passage mein aisa kya nahi likha hai jo dakshini Africa mein ghoomte samay paryatakon ko pata hona chahiye?,"The correct answer is **C: Dakshin Africa ke lagbhag sabhi padosi desh sthir hain** (Almost all neighboring countries of South Africa are stable).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""yadyapi dakshin Africa mein shanti hai, sabhi padosi deshon mein nahin"" (although there is peace in South Africa, not all neighboring countries have it). This directly contradicts option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Alag alag deshon mein visa ko lekar alag kanoon hain** (There are different laws regarding visas in different countries): This *is* mentioned in the passage (""Visa ke liye zaruri chizen aur iska shulk har desh ke hisaab se alag-alag hota hai"").
* **B: Ubad khabad raaste par maujood jagahon par car se jaana behtar hota hai** (It is better to travel by car to places on rough roads): The passage supports this, saying a 4x4 is advisable and some places *require* a high wheel-base 4x4.
* **D: Agar car se yatra kar rahe hain to 4x4 ka sujhaav diya jaata hai** (A 4x4 is suggested if traveling by car): The passage explicitly states this (""4x4 sabse sahi rahega"").



"
"Passage ke anusaar, car se dakshin africa ghoomne waale parytakon ke liye kya salah kharab maani jaayegi?","The correct answer is **B: Waise 4x4 ki salah di jaati hai, lekin adhiktar jagahon ko samany vahan se bhi ghooma jaa sakta hai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""यह सावधानीपूर्वक योजना के साथ एक सामान्य कार में भी किया जा सकता है लेकिन 4x4 सबसे सही रहेगा..."" (It can be done with a normal car with careful planning, but 4x4 is most suitable...) This means a regular car *can* work, making option B a misinterpretation of the advice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kanooni roop se car mein kuch khaas samaan rakhna padega** - The passage *supports* this. It mentions each country has laws about required emergency items in a car.
* **C: Car se yatra un logon ke liye achchha vikalp hai jo aam raaston se alag jaana chahte hain** - The passage *supports* this. It starts by saying a car trip is a great way to see beauty beyond typical tourist routes.
* **D: Dakshini Africa ka har padosi desh ghoomne ke lihaj se theek nahi hai** - The passage *supports* this. It warns that peace exists in South Africa, but not necessarily in neighboring countries.



"
Passage mein apne bags khaali chhodne par kya khatra nahi bataya gaya hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Kisi aur ka samaan samjha jaa sakta hai**.

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses the dangers of leaving your bag unattended:
    *   Becoming an unwitting drug carrier (B)
    *   Theft (A)
    *   Attracting attention from officials concerned about bombs (D)

*   The passage **does not** mention the possibility of your bag being mistaken for someone else's belongings.

Therefore, option C is the danger *not* mentioned in the passage.



"
Passage mein drug vaahak ke baare mein kya nahi bataya gaya hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Adhikari aapke bags japt kar sakte hain, chahe aap drugs na le jaa rahe hon**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses entirely on the *risk* of unknowingly becoming a drug carrier.** It details the potential consequences *if* you are found with drugs.  It doesn't mention officers seizing bags without any suspicion of drug involvement (like for random security checks, or if the bag looks suspicious for other reasons).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuch deshon mein, pehli baar jurm karne waalo ko maut ki saza ho sakti hai** - This *is* stated in the passage: ""...inmein 10 saal se adhik ke jail ki saza yaa maut bhi shamil ho sakti hai.""
* **B: Antarrashtriya yatra mein khaas dhyan rakhna chahiye** - The entire passage emphasizes this point: ""apne bag ko kabhi bhi apni nazar se ojhal naa hone den, khas kar jab aap antarrashtriya seema ko paar kar rahe hone.""
* **C: Drug soonghne waale kutte bina notice ke istemaal kiye jaa sakte hain** - This is also stated directly: ""drug-soonghne waale kutton se binaa kisi notice ke kisi bhi samay kam lia jaa sakta hai.""



"
Kis tarah ka pey ghar par chhutti ke dauraan banane ke baare mein nahi bataya gaya hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Beer**.

Here's why:

* **The text mentions:**
    * **Coffee:** ""apne ghar mein subah ek badhiya coffee"" (good coffee in the morning at home)
    * **Chamomile Chai (Tea):** ""raat mein kuch aramdayak camomile chay"" (relaxing chamomile tea at night)
    * **Smoothy/Juice:** ""kuchh smoothy ka juice banaane yaa blend karne ka avsar uthaayen"" (take the opportunity to make or blend a smoothie/juice)
* **Beer** is suggested as a possibility by mentioning going to a bar or pub, but *making* beer at home is *not* discussed in the text. The text only mentions going *to* a bar/pub for a different drinking experience.

Therefore, beer is the type of beverage not specifically mentioned as one to *make* at home during a vacation.



"
"Agar aapka shehar apni peene ki sanskriti ke liye jaana jaata hai, to aapko chhutti ke dauraan kahan jaana chahiye?","The correct answer is **C: Pubs jahan aap aam taur par nahi jaate** (Pubs you don't usually go to).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Yadi aap aise shahar mein rehte hai jahan drinking culture alag-alag hai, toh aap us nazdiki bar yaa pub mein jaaiye jahan aap baar-baar nahin jaate hain."" (If you live in a city where the drinking culture is different, go to a nearby bar or pub that you don't go to often.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aapke pados se baahar ke coffee shops (Coffee shops outside your neighborhood)** - The passage mentions coffee, but not as a destination *specifically* for a city known for its drinking culture.
*   **B: Juice ya smoothie ke shops (Juice or smoothie shops)** - While smoothies are mentioned as something to *make* at home, they aren't linked to exploring a city's drinking culture.
*   **D: Chamomile chai banane waale restaurants (Restaurants that make chamomile tea)** - Chamomile tea is suggested for relaxation at home, not for experiencing a city's nightlife.



"
Kabooraton ki moortiyan kahan hain?,"The correct answer is **B: Church ke parisar mein** (In the premises of the church).

The passage explicitly states: ""Church ke parisar mein, kuch kabron par kabootaron ke sangamarmarse banaai gayi dilchasp moortiyaan hain."" (In the premises of the church, there are interesting marble statues of pigeons on some graves.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gaon se aadhe ghante ki doori par** - While the island and church are near the village, the statues themselves are *within* the church premises.
*   **C: Eysturoy ke dweep par** - The island is mentioned, but the statues are specifically located in the church grounds.
*   **D: Church ke andar** - The passage says the statues are on *graves* within the church *premises*, not *inside* the church building."
Kis tarah ke visa mein vyakti ko aarthik sahyog ka saboot dikhana padta hai?,"Correct answer: **D: Chhaatr visa**

The text specifically states: ""Adhikansh deshon ke liye, aapko us sansthan se ek prastaav patra ki aavashyakta hogi, jahaan par aap adhyayan karna chahte hai **aur course ke pehle varsh mein khud ke kharche ke liye dhan ka saboot bhi**.""  This directly links financial proof to the student visa requirement."
Kise badhi tareekh ke visa ki zaroorat padegi?,"The correct answer is **C: Antarrashtriya Chhaatr (International Student)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...ek antarrashtriya chhaatr ke nazariye se vahan jaane ke liye aapko kabhi-kabhaar aane waale paryatak ke mukabale aam taur par zyada lambe samay tak rehna padta hai. Samanya taur par, kisi bhi videshi desh mein samay avadhi ke baad bahut samay tak rahne ke liye aapko pehle hi visa praapt karne ki aavashyakta hogi.""  (From an international student's perspective, going there usually requires a longer stay than a casual tourist. Generally, to stay in a foreign country for a significant period, you will need to obtain a visa in advance.)

The passage details the specific requirements for *student* visas, highlighting their difference from tourist or business visas.  Therefore, it's international students who are most likely to need a long-term visa.



"
Aapko machchharon par khaas savdhani kab rakhni chahiye?,"The correct answer is **C: Varshavan ke beech** (In the rainforest/dense vegetation).

**Explanation:**

The passage specifically states that when thinking about traveling *through* the rainforest (varshaavan), you need to be aware of mosquitoes. It even gives an example of how quickly they can enter a vehicle while passing through such areas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Garmiyon me** (In summers) - While summers are mentioned as the time you *might* be thinking about this, the focus isn't just on the season, but on the *location* you're travelling through.
*   **B: Chadhai karte samay** (While climbing) - This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Gaadi chalate samay** (While driving) - Driving is used as an *example* of being *in* the rainforest, but it's the rainforest itself that requires caution, not just the act of driving.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, aapko varshavan mein gaadi chalate samay machchharon se bachne ke liye kya nahi karna chahiye?","The correct answer is **A: Vahan ke darwaze zyada der tak khule rakhna**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that even opening car doors for ""a few seconds"" while driving through rainy areas is enough time for mosquitoes to enter. This means keeping doors open for *longer* would increase the risk.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Garmiyon ke dauran gaadi chalana:** The passage mentions summer *as a time when you need to be particularly aware of mosquitoes*, not that you shouldn't drive then.
*   **C: Uposhnakatibandhiya ilaakon mein gaadi chalana:** The passage mentions this area specifically as one where mosquitoes are prevalent, but doesn't say you should avoid driving there. It just implies you need to be extra cautious.
*   **D: Chadhai karte samay vahan khaali chhod dena:** This is not mentioned in the passage at all.

Therefore, the passage's warning directly relates to the duration of open car doors in rainy areas."
"Passage ke anusaar, Sundarbans ke baare mein inmein se kya baat sahi nahi hai?","The correct answer is **B: Iska aadha ilaaka daldal mein hai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sunderban 3,850 varg kilometres mein phaila hai, jismein se karib ek tihai mein paani/daldal wala ilaka hai."" (Sunderban is spread over 3,850 square kilometers, of which about one-third is water/wetland area).
* One-third is *not* half.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

* **A: Ismein kuch bache hue shaktishaali jungle hain:** The passage states, ""way kuch antim shaktishali jungles mein se hain, jo kabhi ganga pathar ko cover karte the."" (these are some of the last strong jungles that once covered the Ganges plateau).
* **C: Yeh duniya ki sabse badi Mangrove patti hai:** The passage begins by saying, ""Sunderban duniya ka sabse bada tateeya mangrove shetra hai."" (Sunderban is the world's largest tidal mangrove forest.)
* **D: Yahan bengal tigers se zyada chital hain:** The passage states there are approximately 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 chital, so there are significantly more chital.



"
Jungle ka kaunsa hissa bhartiya ilaake mein hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sundarbans National Park**.

The passage states: ""jungle ka wah hissa jo bharat mein hai usko sunderban national park kahaa jaataa hai"" which translates to ""That part of the jungle which is in India is called Sundarbans National Park."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Vanyajeev abhyaaran (Wildlife Sanctuary):** While Sunderban *became* a wildlife sanctuary in 1966, the passage specifically names the National Park as the part within India.
* **C: Vishwa dharoharon ki soochi ki jagah (Place in the list of World Heritage):** This describes Sunderban's status, not the *part* of it within India.
* **D: Ganga pathar (Ganga Plateau):** The passage mentions Sunderban used to cover the Ganga Plateau, but doesn't say this is the part within India.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, kise kum se kum English bhasha ki seemit jaankari hogi?","The correct answer is **B: Kum umr ke log**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...and even more in whom you can expect a limited knowledge - especially young people.""  This directly implies that young people are more likely to have limited English knowledge, even in countries where English is prevalent.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Log jo kum se kum do anya bhashayein bolte hon:** The passage doesn't suggest a correlation between knowing multiple languages and English proficiency.
*   **C: Toronto yatra karne waale log:** Toronto is presented as a place where people from different English-speaking backgrounds converge, implying some level of English is common.
*   **D: Zyada umr ke log:** The passage specifically points to *young* people as the group most likely to have limited English knowledge.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, kya uchchaaran karna mushkil hota hai?","Sahi jawab hai **B: Pate**.

Passage mein likha hai: ""yah vishesh roop se paton ke liye such hai, jinhen aksar thik se uchchaaran karna mushkil hota hai."" 

Ise dhyan mein rakhen ki passage alag lahje, likhe hue shabdon, aur sthaniye boli ke baare mein bhi baat karta hai, lekin uccharan mein mushkili ke vishesh sandarbh mein sirf pate ka zikr kiya gaya hai."
"Passage ke anusaar, Inter-district bus station se bus pakadne ki soch rahe yatri ke liye kya sahi rahega?","Correct answer is **B: Yatri Bumthang jaa raha hai aur use 7 baje tak nikalna hai**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""zyadaatar, khaas kar poorv aur jakar/bumtang ki ore jaane vaali basein subah 06:30 aur 07:30 ke bich jaati hain.""  This means buses to Bumthang typically leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
* **Option B** aligns with this information.  A traveler going to Bumthang needs to leave by 7 AM to catch a bus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage mentions Jakar, it doesn't guarantee a traveler going to Jakar has *already* bought a ticket (though it's recommended).
* **C:** The passage doesn't mention buses to Paro, and the timeframe of ""11 baje ke baad"" (after 11 AM) isn't supported. Shared taxis are mentioned for Paro.
* **D:** The passage doesn’t mention buses going west (""pashchim"") and arriving before 6:20 AM isn’t mentioned specifically.



"
Inter-district bus station se pashchim jaane waale yatri ke liye achchhi salah kya hogi?,"The correct answer is **C: Din bhar basein chalti hain**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Inter-district bus station se **din bhar** basein chalti hain..."" (Buses run throughout the day from the inter-district bus station...).  This directly answers the question about travel to the west (which is just a general direction from the station).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Basein 8:30 ke baad hi jati hain:** The passage mentions buses to the east and north departing earlier (6:30-7:30 am) but doesn't specify a cut-off time for westward buses.
* **B: Kuch din pehle ticket kharidna uchit hota hai:** This is good advice *in general* because buses are often full, but it doesn't specifically address travel *to the west*.
* **D: Shared taxiyan tez aur aramdayak sadhan hain:**  This refers to travel to nearby places like Paro and Punakha, not general west-bound travel.



"
Nimnalikhit mein se kaun sa Timbuktu ka sateek varnan nhi hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Yha hawai jahaz se nhi jaya ja sakta (You cannot travel here by airplane)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**aur ismein ek hawai adda hai**"" (and it has an airport).  This directly contradicts option C.

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurate descriptions based on the passage:

* **A: Yah kisi african shahar ke bajaay arab shahar lagta hai (It looks like an Arab city instead of an African city):** The passage states this directly.
* **B: Ghareeb shahar hai (It's a poor city):** The passage says ""**Aaj, timbuktu ek sadhanhin shahar hai**"" (Today, Timbuktu is a resource-less city), implying poverty.
* **D: Paryatako ke liye aakarshan- ka kendra hai (It's a center of attraction for tourists):** The passage states ""**haalaanki iski pratishthhaa iske paryatak aakarshan se banaati hai**"" (although its reputation is built on its tourist attractions).



"
Inme se kaun si baat Timbuktu ke liye shi hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Yha hawai jahaz se jaya ja sakta hai** (You can travel here by airplane).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...aur ismein ek hawai adda hai."" ( ...and it has an airport.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yha ghareebon ke bjay videshi log jyada hai** (There are more foreigners here than poor people) - The passage doesn't discuss the demographics of visitors or residents.
* **C: Yah kisi african shahar ke bajaay arab shahar lagta hai** (It looks more like an Arab city than an African city) - While the passage *does* state this, it's presented as a characteristic of the city, not necessarily something ""true"" about it in the same way having an airport is. The question asks for something *is* true, not a characteristic.
* **D: Ab yha yatri nhi aate** (No tourists come here now) - The passage says ""iski pratishthhaa iske paryatak aakarshan se banaati hai"" (...its reputation is built by its tourist attractions), meaning tourists *do* come.



"
Grishmakaleen olympic mool roop se kab nirdhaarit kiye gaye the? ,"The correct answer is **D: July 2020**.

The text states: ""...cancel karne ke zyaadaatar neetiyaan july 2020 tak nahin badhaai jaati hain, yaani jab olympic schedule kiya gaya tha.""  This translates to ""...most cancellation policies were not extended until July 2020, which is when the Olympics were scheduled.""

Therefore, the summer Olympics were originally scheduled for July 2020.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, kuppi kis bindu par bavandar ban jaati hai?","The correct answer is **D: Jameen ko chhoote hi** (As soon as it touches the ground).

The passage states: ""Shuruat mein way toofan ke baadlon se niche utarne waali kuppi ke tarah hote hain, aur jameen ko chhoote hi """"bavandar"""" ban jaate hain.""  This directly translates to ""Initially they look like a funnel descending from storm clouds, and become a 'tornado' as soon as they touch the ground.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jab hawa ki gati 100 meal prati ghanta hoti hai** (When the wind speed is 100 mph) - While the passage mentions 100-200 mph winds, it doesn't say this *is* when the funnel becomes a tornado. It's a *characteristic* of a tornado, not the defining moment of formation.
* **B: Jab hawa ka ek astambh ghumna shuru karta hai** (When a column of air starts to rotate) - Rotation is part of the definition, but the passage specifies the ground contact is key.
* **C: Toofan ke baadlon se niche utarne par** (Upon descending from storm clouds) - Descending is the *beginning* of the process, but it's not the point at which it becomes a tornado.



"
Inme se kaun sa bavandar ka sateek lakshan hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Inme hawayon ki gati aksar 100-200 meal / ghanta hoti hai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Way tez havaayen (aksar 100-200 meal / ghanta) paida karte hain."" (They produce very strong winds, often 100-200 mph). This is a defining characteristic.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate or incomplete:

* **B: Bavandar aksar apne saath bhari vastuon ko uthaakar le jaataa hai** - While true, this is a *result* of the strong winds, not a defining characteristic of *what* a tornado *is*.
* **C: Jameen chhote hi yeh baadlon se niche utarne waali kuppi ke tarah ho jate hain** - This describes the *formation* of a tornado, not its fundamental nature.
* **D: Bavandar hawa ka ek ghumta huwa astambh hota hai jisme hawa bahar ki oor chalti hai** - The passage says it pulls air *up and down* (""under aur oopar ke taraf khinchta hai""), not just outwards.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, kisi yatri ko us shahar ki raajaneetik sthiti ke baare mein parmarsh kahaan se lena chaahiye jha wah ja rha hai?","The correct answer is **D: Apni sarkar se**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Apni sarkar ke alawa aap anya deshon ke sarkaron ke salah le sakte hain."" (Besides your own government, you can take advice from other countries' governments.) This directly indicates that a traveler should primarily consult *their own* government for advice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Us desh ki sarkar se jha wah ja rhe hai** - While you *can* consult the destination country's government (as the passage mentions), it's not the primary source of advice. Their advice is geared towards *their* citizens.
*   **B: Yatra parmarsh ke vivaran se** - The passage states travel advisories are a brief overview and often superficial, not a comprehensive source of information.
*   **C: Us shahar ke unke nagrikon se jha wah ja rhe hai** - The passage highlights that different nationalities may experience situations differently, making advice from local citizens potentially biased or not applicable to the traveler.



"
"Yatra parmarsh ki sthiti mein, ek videshi nagrik ko kya anubhav hone ki sambhaavana nhi hai?","The correct answer is **D: desh ki raajneetik sthiti ke baare mein vistrit jankari** (detailed information about the country's political situation).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that travel advisories are ""often superficial, general, and extraordinary"" and a ""mere small description of the political situation in any country."" They *don't* provide detailed information.  The passage says you can find ""more extensive information"" elsewhere.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yatra swaasthya bima prabhaavit ya rad ho sakta hai** (Travel health insurance may be affected or canceled) - This is directly stated in the passage.
* **B: Advisory kisi bhi desh mein raajneetik isthiti ka mahaz chhota-sa vivaran hai** (Advisory is merely a small description of the political situation in any country) - This is also a direct statement from the passage.
* **C: Aapka swaasthya bima prabhaavit ho sakta hai** (Your health insurance may be affected) - Similar to A, this is stated in the passage.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, kis prakaar ki yatra ke liye travel agent se booking sahayta ki jarurat sbse kam hoti hai?","The correct answer is **A: KisI aise shahar mein karya sammelan ke liye yatra, jahaan yatri pahle ja chuka hai** (A trip to a city for a conference where the traveler has been before).

Here's why:

The passage states travel agents are *particularly* helpful for trips that are different from your past travel experiences - involving nature, culture, language, or less-visited countries.  

If you're going to a city you've already visited for a standard conference, the trip is likely *not* different from your past experiences. You likely know how to book flights and hotels to that city, and it doesn't fall into the categories the passage highlights as needing an agent's expertise.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kisi khas budgett me do saptaah lambi yatra** (A two-week trip on a specific budget): Agents can be helpful finding deals within a budget.
* **C: Aese desh ki yatra jha ki bhasha alag ho** (A trip to a country with a different language):  The passage explicitly says agents are helpful for trips involving language differences.
* **D: Yatri ki pahli videsh yatra** (A traveler's first international trip): First-time international travel often involves complexities where an agent's expertise is valuable.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, kis sthiti mein ek yatri ko travel agent ki madad se sabse zyada laabh hoga?","The correct answer is **B: Jab yatri pahli baar kisis vishesh jagah ja rha ho** (When a traveler is going to a specific place for the first time).

Here's why:

The passage states that a travel agent is a good option for trips that are *different* from your previous travel experience – involving nature, culture, language, or less-visited countries. This directly implies that if you're unfamiliar with a place (going for the first time), an agent's expertise will be most valuable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** Roundtrip flights to your hometown are typically straightforward bookings that don't require specialized knowledge.
*   **C & D:** Knowing the language or being familiar with the culture *decreases* the need for a travel agent, as you're less reliant on someone else's expertise.

Therefore, option B aligns best with the passage's recommendation."
"Passage ke hisab se, nyi jagah ki yatra karte samay ek yatri nirasha se kaise bach sakta hai?","The correct answer is **A: Kinhi chizonse ye ummid naa karein ki way vaisi hi hongi jaisi aapke ghar par thi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""yah kuch aisaa hai ki jo aapko hamesha dhyan mein rakhne ke zaroorat hai, nirasha v asthaaniya tarikon ko napsand karne se bachne ke liye"" *after* mentioning that things like customs, laws, food, etc. will be different.  Therefore, avoiding the *expectation* that things will be the same as home is the key to avoiding disappointment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Alag bhojan try karna (Trying different food):** While potentially a positive experience, the passage doesn't suggest this *prevents* disappointment.
* **C: Jha se aap hai wha ke kanoon manna (Following the laws where you are from):** This is incorrect; you should follow the laws of the *new* place.
* **D: Jha aap ja rhe hai wha ke bare me pahle se jankari jutana (Gathering information about where you are going beforehand):**  While helpful, the core message is about adjusting your *expectations*, not just being informed.  You can be informed and *still* be disappointed if you expect things to be like home.



"
"Passage me di gayi jankari ke mutabik, kis tarah ke vyakti ko videshi yatra karte samay nirasha ho sakti hai?","The correct answer is **C: Jo sankuchit soch ka ho (Who has a narrow mindset)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that travelers should *not* expect things to be the same as at home. It emphasizes differences in customs, laws, food, transportation, accommodation, standards, and language.  Someone with a ""sankuchit soch"" (narrow mindset) would be rigid in their expectations and unwilling to accept these differences, leading to disappointment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jise shandar bhojan pasand ho (Who likes fancy food):**  The passage mentions food will be different, but doesn't say someone who likes fancy food *will* be disappointed. They might simply try new things.
* **B: Jise alag chijen pasand ho (Who likes different things):** This is the opposite of the answer! Someone who likes different things would likely *enjoy* the changes encountered while traveling.
* **D: Jo hmesha nyi chize seekhane ke liye tyyar rhe (Who is always ready to learn new things):** This person would also adapt well and avoid disappointment.



"
Kisi vikasshil desh mein pehli baar jaane vaale yatriyon ke liye nimnalikhit mein se kaun si salaah jaruri nhi hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuch dino tak bhojn par fijoolkharchi karne se bachen** (Avoid splurging on food for a few days).

Here's why:

The passage specifically recommends *prioritizing* Western-style and quality hotels, food, and services, **especially in the initial days**. This implies spending a bit more on food initially for comfort and safety is advisable. The other options are directly mentioned as advice:

*   **A:** ""Un shetraon mein zameen par gadde yaa ped par naa soein, jahan aapko asthaaniya jeevon ke baare mein nahin pata hai."" (Don't sleep on the ground or under trees in areas where you're unfamiliar with local life) - Directly from the text.
*   **C:** ""Yadi aap shivir ke liye baahar jaa rahe hain, toh aap saanp, bichchu se bachne ke liye shivir khaat yaa jhula laaye."" (If you're camping, bring a cot or hammock to avoid snakes and scorpions) - Directly from the text.
*   **D:** ""khas kar apne shuruati dino mein, paschimi shaili aur gunvattapurna hotel...par zor dene ka prayaas karne par vichaar karein."" (Consider prioritizing Western-style and quality hotels... especially in your initial days) - Directly from the text.

Therefore, avoiding splurging on food isn't mentioned as advice. The passage encourages comfort and quality when adjusting to a new culture, which may include spending more on food initially.



"
"Kisi vikasshil desh mein dhalte samay, nimnalikhit me se kin chizon par fijoolkharchi karne se mna nhi kiya gya hai?","The correct answer is **C: Gadde yaa ped par**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly advises *against* sleeping on the ground or in trees in areas where you're unfamiliar with local life. It suggests prioritizing Western-style and quality hotels, food, and services *especially* in the beginning, and brings up sleeping arrangements specifically as a safety concern when camping.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Paschimi shaili ka bhojan (Western-style food):** The passage suggests prioritizing it initially.
*   **B: Gunvattapurna sevaaon (Quality services):** The passage suggests prioritizing these initially.
*   **D: Gunvattapurna hotel (Quality hotels):** The passage suggests prioritizing these initially.

Therefore, the passage discourages spending time on ""gadde yaa ped par"" (the ground or in trees) in unfamiliar areas."
Agar kisi vyakti ko apne bima ki copy internet ke binaa chahiye ho to inme se kaun sa vikalp sabse shi hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Laptop ki memory me ek copy store karein**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Yadi laptop yaa tablet ke saath yatra kar rahe hain toh memory yaa disc (internet ke binaa access ke jaa sakne waali) mein ek copy store karein."" (If you are traveling with a laptop or tablet, store a copy in memory or on a disc (that can be accessed without the internet).)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yatra ke sathiyon ko copy dena (Giving a copy to travel companions):** While helpful for others, it doesn't solve *this person's* need for offline access.
* **B: Khud ko ek copy e-mail karein (Emailing a copy to yourself):**  Requires internet access to retrieve the email.
* **D: Ek copy “cloud” me save karein (Saving a copy to the “cloud”):**  Requires internet access to retrieve the file.

The question specifically asks for a way to have the copy *without* internet, making option C the only logical answer based on the provided text.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, bima ki prati me kya dikhane ki zaroorat nahi hai?","The correct answer is **D: Bima karaane wale ka e-mail pata**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states you need to have the *bimakarta* (insurer's) email address and international phone number for claims. It doesn't mention needing the *bima karane wale* (policyholder's) email address.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Daavaa karne ke liye antarrashtriya phone number** - The passage explicitly says you need the insurer's international phone number for claims.
*   **B: Bimakarta ka e-mail pata** - The passage explicitly says you need the insurer's email address for claims.
*   **C: Pushti karne ke liye antarrashtriya phone number** - While ""pushti"" (confirmation) isn't explicitly stated, the international phone number is needed for *authorization* and *claims*, and confirmation falls under those categories.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, kon sa film praarup sabse aam hai?","The correct answer is **D: 36 x 24 mm negative**.

The passage states: ""maanak 35 MM film (36 gunaa 24 MM negative) sabse aam hai."" This directly translates to ""standard 35 MM film (36 by 24 MM negative) is the most common.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 6 x 6 cm negative:** While mentioned, the passage says this is used by *medium-format* cameras, not that it's the *most common*.
*   **B: 56 x 56 mm negative:** This is a variation within the 6x6 format and not the most common overall.
*   **C: 35 MM negative:** While correct that it *is* a film format, the passage specifically states the *36 x 24 mm* version of 35mm film is most common.



"
DSLR ke tulna mein lagbhag vaisa resolution kon sa film format deta hai?,"The correct answer is **A: 35 mm film**.

The passage states: ""maanak 35 MM film (36 gunaa 24 MM negative) sabse aam hai. Agar aap chalaate hain aur yah vartamaan DSLR ke tulna mein lagbhag vaisa resolution deta hai...""  This directly translates to ""Standard 35 MM film (36 x 24 MM negative) is the most common. If you shoot it and it gives approximately the same resolution as current DSLRs...""

Therefore, 35mm film provides a resolution comparable to a DSLR."
"Passage ke hisab se, Yatra lekhan ke vyavasaay ko shuru karne ke liye inme se kausa sa charan sabse antim hoga?","The correct answer is **C: Apni website banaana**.

Here's why:

The passage outlines a sequence:

1. **Improve skills:** Read established travel blogs.
2. **Learn technical skills:** Learn formatting and editing *from* those blogs.
3. **Build your own:** *After* learning formatting and editing, you can create your own website.

Therefore, building your website is the final step described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Website par formatting seekhna** - This is a step *before* building the website.
*   **B: Asthaapit yatra blog website ke liye kayi blog likhna** - The passage doesn't mention writing for other blogs, only *reading* them.
*   **D: Apne editing kaushal mein sudhaar laana** - This is also a step *before* building the website.



"
"Yatra lekhan ke vyavasaay ko shuru karne ke liye, sabse pahle kya karna chahiye?","The correct answer is **A: Blogging**.

Here's why:

The passage states the *easiest* way to start a travel writing business is to **read established travel blogs to improve your skills**. This means the first step is essentially immersing yourself in the world of travel blogging, which is blogging.  The other options (formatting, editing, website building) come *after* learning from existing blogs.



"
Kis prakaar kee jalvaayu mein aanton ke samasyaaen aam taur par pai jati hain?,"The correct answer is **C: Germ jalvaayu mein** (In a humid climate).

The passage explicitly states: ""isliye daily bailley, the pharaoh curse, montejhoonamaaz revenge aur unke kayee doston ko saza bhugatni padi hai. Jaise ki thhande mausam mein sans lene ke samasyaaen, **garm mausam mein aanton ke samasyaaen kaafee aam hain**...""  While it mentions cold weather and breathing problems, it specifically links intestinal problems to *warm* (garm) weather, which is described as a humid climate where bacteria thrive.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer based on the text."
"Passage ke hisab se, nirantar sampark mein aane ke karan, kiske prati pratiraksha viksit hone ki sambhavana bahut adhik hai?","The correct answer is **B: Asthaaniya keetanuon (Local germs)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ghar par, asthaaniya keetanuon ke nirantar sampark mein aane ke karan, bahut adhik sambhavana hai ki aap mein unke liye pratiraksha pehle hi viksit ho chuki ho."" (Because of constant contact with local germs at home, it is very likely that you have already developed immunity to them.)

The question asks *what* you are likely to have developed immunity to due to constant contact. The passage directly answers this as ""Asthaaniya keetanuon"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aanton ke samasyaaen (Intestinal problems):** The passage states these are *common* in hot weather, not that immunity is developed against them.
*   **C: Sans lene ke samasyaaen (Breathing problems):** Similarly, these are *common* in cold weather, not related to developed immunity.
*   **D: Daily bailley:** This is a name mentioned as someone who suffered, not something you develop immunity to.



"
Schengen zone me yatra karne ka nimnalikhit mein se kaun sa laabh hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Alag-alag visa ka aveden nahin denaa padta hai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Isi tarah se, Schengen ka visa hone par, aapko Schengen sadasya deshon ke liye alag-alag visa ka aveden nahin denaa padta hai..."" (Similarly, having a Schengen visa means you don't have to apply for separate visas for Schengen member countries...).

Let's look at why the other options are not the *most* accurate, although related:

* **B: Paise ki bachat hoti hai** - While true (because you save on multiple visa fees), the passage doesn't primarily highlight this as the key benefit. It's a *result* of not needing multiple visas.
* **C: Passport niyantran chaukiyon se guzre binaa seema paar kr sakte hai** - This is also true, but it's a *consequence* of the Schengen Zone's borderless nature, rather than the core benefit of the visa itself.
* **D: Passport ki zaroorat nhi padti** - This is incorrect. You still need a passport, but you don't need to show it at every border crossing *within* the Schengen Zone.



Therefore, the most direct and accurate benefit mentioned in the passage regarding Schengen Zone travel is not needing to apply for individual visas for each country."
Tutankhamun ke makbare me ab kya nhi bacha?,"The correct answer is **D: Meenaaren**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maqabare ke shandar meenaaren abusmen nahin hain, lekin inhen hataakar carro ke esyptian museum mein rakh diya gaya hai.""  (The magnificent murals of the tomb are no longer present, but they have been removed and placed in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Seemit sajawat (Limited decoration)**: The passage actually *mentions* the limited decoration as a reason the tomb isn't that impressive, not that it's gone.
*   **B & C: Mummy ka sir & Mummy ke kandhe (Mummy's head & Mummy's shoulders)**: The passage says these are *visible* but damaged, not missing.
*   **D: Meenaaren (Murals)**: The passage states these have been *removed* from the tomb."
"Passage ke hisab se, paise bachane wale yatriyon ke liye Vancouver ki kaun si jagah sabse kam khas hogi? ","The correct answer is **D: Whitsler**.

Here's why:

The passage states Whitsler is a popular destination *because* of the 2010 Winter Olympics. It focuses on expensive activities like skiing and mountain biking. It doesn’t mention any budget-friendly options.

Let’s look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **Granville Island:** Accessible by affordable water taxis from Vancouver.
*   **Bowen Island:** Promotes activities like kayaking and hiking, which can be relatively inexpensive.
*   **Sky Corridor:** Mentions a trek, which is a generally low-cost activity.

Therefore, Whitsler is most likely to be the least appealing for budget travelers."
"Passage ke hisab se, yatriyon ko kis jagah Vancouver ka sabse pramanik anubhav milta hai?","The correct answer is **A: Bowen dweep**.

The passage states: ""Bowen dweep ek lokpriya...yah pramanik samudaay Vancouver ke thik baahar howay sound mein isthit hai..."" This directly translates to ""Bowen Island is a popular...it is an authentic community located just outside Vancouver in Howe Sound...""

Therefore, the passage specifically identifies Bowen Island as offering an authentic experience near Vancouver."
"Passage ke hisab se, agar yatriyon ko jalprapaat ka drishya aspasht dekhne ke liye kab jana chahiye?","The correct answer is **C: Jab paani ki matra adhik ho**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yadi aap pul paar karenge yaa jharne ke paas ke ghumaavdaar pagadandiyon par chalenge, toh aap avashya hi bhig jayenge. Doosri ore, yah thik hai kyonki paani ki matra itni adhik hai ki aapke vaastavik jalprapaat ka drishya aspasht ho jayega - sabhi paani se!"" 

This directly links the obscured view of the waterfall to a high volume of water.  While November to March (A) is *when* the water volume is high, the question asks *when* the view will be obscured, and that's when there's a lot of water.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Victoria jalprapaat ko november aur march ke beech me dekhne ke kya laabh hai?","The correct answer is **C: Jharne zyada manmohak dikhai denge**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Barsaat ke mausam (november se march) mein paani ki matra zyada hogi aur jharne zyada manmohak dikhai denge."" (During the rainy season (November to March) the water volume will be higher and the waterfalls will appear more spectacular.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jalprapaat ka drishya aspasht ho jayega** - While the passage *mentions* the view can be obscured by water, it doesn't present this as a *benefit*.
* **B: Yatriyon ki sankhya kam hoti hai** - The passage doesn't provide information about tourist numbers.
* **D: Barsaat ke mausam se bach jayege** - The passage explicitly says it *is* the rainy season.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, drone ka istemal karke film bnate samay kya karne ki salah nhi di jati?","The correct answer is **D: Sirf bhid ke oopar se drone se film bnana jha se log use nhi dekhege**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Airport ke nazdeek yaa bhid ke oopar ek udtaa hua drone aapke shetra mein bhale hi gair-kanuni naa raha ho, lekin hamesha yah ek burra vichaar hai."" (Even if flying a drone near an airport or over a crowd isn't illegal in your area, it's always a bad idea.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pehle hi jaanch lain ke apko kya film banaane ke anumati hai** - The passage *advises* this (""pehle hi acchi tarah jaanch lain ki aapko kya film banaane ke anumati hai"").
*   **B: Atirikt license ke zaroorat hai** - The passage mentions the *need* to check for additional licenses (""kis permit yaa atirikt license ke zaroorat hai"").
*   **C: Research karne ki anumati** - The passage doesn’t mention needing permission to do research itself, but rather permission to *film*.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, drone ka istemal karke film bnane ki sabse achi jagah kon si hain?","Correct answer is **D: Aese shetra jha apko film bnane ka permit pehle ki mil gya hai**

**Reasoning:**

The passage explicitly states: ""Agar drone ka istemal kar rahe hain, toh pehle hi acchi tarah jaanch lain ki aapko kya film banaane ke anumati hai aur kis permit yaa atirikt license ke zaroorat hai.""  This directly means the best place to film with a drone is a location where you've already obtained the necessary permissions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage specifically warns against flying drones over crowds.
*   **B:** The passage states that if you don't have permission to *photograph* something, you shouldn't *record* it.
*   **C:**  Even if a drone is less visible, it doesn't mean it's legal or safe to fly there. The passage emphasizes checking permits.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Visa prakriya ke lie panjikaran aavashyakta ke sambandh mein kaun sa kathan satya nahin hai?","Sahi jawab **B: Sabhi deshon ko asthaaniya adhikariyon ke saath panjikaran ki aavashyakta hai** hai.

**Passage mein saaf-saaf kaha gaya hai ki ""kuch deshon mein"" Visa ke liye panjikaran ki aavashyakta hai, sabhi deshon mein nahi.**

Baaki options passage mein diye gaye jaankaari ke hisaab se sahi hain:

*   **A:** Agar aap paryatakon ke thaharne ki jagah mein hain toh apko register karne ki zarurat nahi hogi - Passage mein yeh kaha gaya hai ki sirf un logon ko register karne ki zarurat hai jo paryatakon ke thaharne ke jagahon se alag kahin ruke hain.
*   **C:** Aapravaasan karyalayon mein jaane ki aavashyakta pad sakti hai - Passage mein yeh kaha gaya hai ki ""iske liye asthaaniya police ke paas ek form bharne ke yaa aapravaasan karyalayon mein jaane aavashyakta pad sakti hai.""
*   **D:** kuch sthaano mein, asthaaniya hotel panjikaran sambhal lenge - Passage mein yeh kaha gaya hai ki ""is tarah ke kanoon waale kayee deshon mein, asthaaniya hotel panjikaran sambhal lenge."""
Nimnalikhit mein se kaunsa vah asthaan nahin hai jahaan ek paryatak apna panjikaran karaane ke lie ja sakata hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Ek asthaaniya post office**.

Here's why:

The passage states that registration for visa processes may require you to register your presence and address with local authorities. It specifically mentions:

* **Local police stations:** ""...iske liye asthaaniya police ke paas ek form bharne...""
* **Immigration offices:** ""...ya aapravaasan karyalayon mein jaane aavashyakta pad sakti hai.""
* **Hotels:** ""...dusre mamalon mein, sirf aise logon ko register karne ke zarurat hai jo paryatakon ke thaharne ke jagahon se alag kahin ruke hain... is tarah ke kanoon waale kayee deshon mein, asthaaniya hotel panjikaran sambhal lenge...""

It **does not** mention post offices as a place to register. Therefore, a tourist cannot register at a local post office according to the provided text."
Yatra karte samay swayamseva karne se kise laabh nhi hoga?,"The correct answer is **B: Achi khasi salary ki talash karne vale ko** (Someone looking for a good salary).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that many volunteer positions *provide room and board in exchange for a small payment*. This means you won't earn a substantial salary.  The passage emphasizes that while it can *help a budget* with room and board covered, it's not a way to earn a good income.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Naye logon se milne ki aasha rakhane vale kisi vyakti ko** (Someone hoping to meet new people) - The passage directly states it's a great way to meet new people.
*   **C: Naya kaushal seekhne ki aasha rakhne vale ko** (Someone hoping to learn new skills) - The passage says it can help you learn new skills.
*   **D: koi aisa vyakti jisaki kamare aur board mein ruchi ho** (Someone interested in room and board) - The passage explains that volunteering often *includes* room and board.

Therefore, someone looking for a good salary would *not* benefit from volunteering while traveling, as it's not a financially lucrative option."
"Passage ke hisaab se, ek budget yatri ke lie videsh mein swayamseva karna kis prakaar laabhadayak hai?","The correct answer is **C: kabhi kabhi kamra aur khana diya jata hai**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Choonki kayee swayamsevi sevaayen kamra aur khana detee hain aur iske evaz mein chhota sa bhugtan letee hain, isliye lambe samay tak rukna budget ko behtar banaane ka ek achcha tarika ho sakta hai.""  This translates to: ""Because many volunteer services provide room and board and take a small payment in return, staying for a long time can be a good way to improve your budget.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Unhe lagabhag hamesha salary di jaati hai** - The passage mentions a ""chhota sa bhugtan"" (small payment), not a salary.
*   **B: Isse rozgaar ka avsar milta hai** - While it can build skills, the passage doesn't focus on it being a job opportunity.
*   **D: Yah pariprekshya ki bhavna ko samajhne mein apki madad karta hai** - While true (as the passage mentions), this isn't specifically about the *budget* benefit for a traveler. It's a general benefit of volunteering.



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, Volt Disney World ki yatra ke liye kya aasamanya mana ja sakta hai?","The correct answer is **B: Ek off-site hotel mein rehna (Staying at an off-site hotel)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the typical Disney World trip involves being ""bus se le jaanaa, ek on-site disney hotel mein"" (being bused to an on-site Disney hotel).  It then states that the trip involves spending almost a week *without leaving the Disney area*. This strongly implies staying *on* Disney property is standard.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Park ki khoj mein ek saptah bitana (Spending a week exploring the park):** The passage states this *is* part of the typical trip (""karib ek saptah bitana"").
* **C: Yatra ka pura samay Disney property par bitana (Spending the entire trip on Disney property):** This is also explicitly stated as typical (""disney ilaake ko chhode binaa"").
* **D: Hawai adde se hotel tak bus lena (Taking a bus from the airport to the hotel):** This is part of the standard procedure described in the passage.



"
Volt Disney World ke baare main nimnalikhit mein se konsa kathan sayta nahi hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Park-hopper ke tickets anya yatriyon ko diye ja sakte hain** (Park-hopper tickets can be given to other travelers).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ticket kisi aur ko nahin diya jaa sakta hai"" (tickets cannot be given to anyone else). This directly contradicts option A.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **B: Yaha on-site avaas uplabdh hai** (There is on-site accommodation available) - The passage mentions ""ek on-site disney hotel mein bus se le jaanaa"" (being bused to an on-site Disney hotel).
*   **C: Yatriyon ko hawai adde se property tak le jaane ke liye bus uplabdh hai** (Bus is available to take travelers from the airport to the property) - The passage states ""Orlando antarrashtriya hawai adde par udan bharna, ek on-site disney hotel mein bus se le jaanaa"" (flying into Orlando International Airport, being bused to an on-site Disney hotel).
*   **D: Nilami ki website par bahu-divasiya ticket mil jaatein hai** (Multi-day tickets are available on auction websites) - The passage says ""Ebay yaa craglist jaisi nilami websites ke madhyam se online beche jaane waale kayee ticket aanshik roop se upayog kiye gaye bahu-divasiya park-hopper ticket hote hain"" (many tickets sold online via auction websites like Ebay or Craigslist are partially used multi-day park-hopper tickets).



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, nimnalikhit mein se kis mudde ko peshevar prashikshan kaksha ya prakaashanon mein shaamil nahin kie jaane ki sabse adhik sambhavana hai?","Sahi jawab hai **A: Jungle mein jeevit rahne ke tarike**.

Passage mein kaha gaya hai ki jungle mein jeevit rahne wali pustakein aur patrikaen *aam* hain, yani easily mil jati hain. Lekin passage mein yeh bhi kaha gaya hai ki yuddh shetron se nipatne wale prakashan *bahut kam* hain. Isse pata chalta hai ki professional training courses ya publications yuddh shetron ki taiyari par jyada focus karenge, jungle mein jeevit rahne ke tarikon par nahi.

Baaki options (B, C, aur D) passage mein training course ke hisab se shaamil hain.
"
"Passage ke hisaab se, peshevar prashikshan kaksha mein nimnalikhit mein se kis vishay ko shaamil kie jaane ki sabse adhik sambhavana hai?","The correct answer is **A: Praathamik upchaar (First aid)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...ek course samanya roop yahaan par charcha kiye sabhi mudde ko vistaar mein cover karega , aam taur par vyaavhaarik anubhav ke saath... aur bahut saaraa praathamik upchaar..."" (A course will generally cover all the discussed points in detail, typically with practical experience... and a lot of first aid...)

While the passage discusses hostile environments and dealing with war zones, the *course* itself is most likely to *include* training in first aid. Options B, C, and D are topics *related* to the situation, but first aid is directly mentioned as being part of the course.



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, sambhaavit taur par dooshit paani se bachne ke lie sabse acha vikalp kya hai?","The correct answer is **B: Paani ki bottle khareedna (Buying bottled water)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*then you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.*"" This directly suggests bottled water as a good option to avoid contaminated water.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Paani ko kayee minute tak ubalna (Boiling water for several minutes):** The passage says this *might* be necessary in *some* areas, but isn't a universally best option.
*   **C: Paani ko ek minute ke liye ubalna (Boiling water for one minute):**  The passage states this is sufficient in *some* areas, but not all.
*   **D: Kuch chuninda khataron ke lie paani ki shuddhta ka aakalan karna (Assessing water purity for certain hazards):** The passage mentions needing to *consider* filter effectiveness, but doesn't present assessment as the best *solution*.

Therefore, the passage positions buying sealed bottled water as the most reliable way to avoid potentially contaminated water.



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, kushal tairakon ke lie bhi kaunsa kaam lagbhag asambhav ho sakata hai?","The correct answer is **C: Dhara ke viruddh tairana (Swimming against the current)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Zyaadaatar mautein paani ke dhara ke viruddh tairane se hone vaali thakan ke vajah se hoti hain, ho sakta hai ki yah namumkin bhi ho.""  This translates to: ""Most deaths are caused by exhaustion from swimming against the current, it may even be impossible.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chattan ke karib tairana (Swimming near rocks):** The passage mentions currents often occur *near* rocks, but doesn't say swimming near them is impossible.
*   **B: Gahare paani mein tairana (Swimming in deep water):**  Deep water is mentioned as a place where strong return flows can occur, but it doesn’t say swimming in it is impossible.
*   **D: Laharon ke aaspas tairana (Swimming around waves):** The passage describes currents *creating* the waves, but doesn't suggest swimming around waves is impossible.



"
Agar aap dhara mein phans jayein to aapko kya karna chahiye?,"The correct answer is **A: Doosri disha mein tairkar dhara se baahar nikalne ki koshish karen, fir samanya roop se tairakar kinaare par vapas aa jayein.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Jaise hi aap dhara se nikal aate hain, peechhe ke or tairne mein koi khaas mushkil nahin hoti hai."" This directly supports the idea of swimming *parallel* to the shore to get *out* of the rip current, then swimming back to shore normally.
* **The passage also states:** ""Zyaadaatar mautein paani ke dhara ke viruddh tairane se hone vaali thakan ke vajah se hoti hain, ho sakta hai ki yah namumkin bhi ho."" This means fighting *against* the current (options B and C) is dangerous and likely to exhaust you.
* **Option D:** Swimming underwater doesn't address the core problem of escaping the rip current.



"
"Passage ke hissab se, mahal ki kis jagah ka daura karne se chuttiyan safal ho jayengi?","The correct answer is **C: Rhine valley mein**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""Rhine valley ke mahalon mein jaanaa"" (visiting the castles in the Rhine Valley) as a good option for inland waterway holidays.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Danube ke kinaare ke ek shahar:** While the passage mentions Danube cruises, it doesn't specifically say *visiting a city* on the Danube will make the holiday successful, only taking a cruise.
*   **B: Iri canal ke bagal mein:** The passage mentions boating *along* the Erie Canal, not specifically visiting *next to* it as a key to a successful holiday.
*   **D: Kisi antardeshiya jalmarg ke pass:** This is too general. The passage gives *specific* examples, and Rhine Valley is one of them.



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, mahila yaatriyon ko nimnalikhit mein se kis baat ki anushansa nahi ki jati?","Correct answer is **C: Chamakdar gahne nahi pahanne chahiye**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states** that women are advised to wear a ring (even an expensive one) - which contradicts the idea of avoiding shiny jewelry.
* **Option A** is directly stated in the passage: women are advised to say they are married regardless of their actual marital status.
* **Option B** is also directly stated: women are warned about potential harassment due to cultural differences.
* **Option D** is advice given to *men* - to be firm and assertive.

Therefore, the passage does *not* advise women *against* wearing shiny jewelry. It actually mentions wearing a ring."
"Passage me diye gaye kshetra ke hisab se, mahila yatriyon ke liye upayogi salah kya hai?","The correct answer is **D: Anchahe advance ke mamle mein, purushon ko dridhata se nakaren** (In the case of unwanted advances, men should firmly reject them).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Purushon ko dridhata se nakaren aur apni baat par behichak adee rahein (saanskritik antaron ke hone yaa nahin hone se yah sahi nahin ho jaataa!)."" This directly advises men to be firm and stand their ground regarding unwanted advances, regardless of cultural differences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yah dekhna asamanya hai ki unka peechha ho** (It is unusual for them to be followed) - The passage *warns* about the possibility of being followed, implying it's *not* unusual.
* **B: Vaivaahik isthiti dikhane ke liye badi angoothi pehanna** (Wearing a large ring to show marital status) - While the passage mentions rings, it specifically says it's not necessarily about wearing an expensive one, but rather about the cultural practice of stating marital status.
* **C: Yah samjhana ki saanskritik antaron ki vajah se apni baat par ade nahi rahna chahiye** (Understanding that due to cultural differences, one should not stand their ground) -  The passage actually says the opposite – standing your ground is important *despite* cultural differences.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, is parisdrishya mein ek vanyajeev photographer ko kisi khaas lens ki aavashyakta hoti hai?","The correct answer is **A: Agar vishesh roop se chhote jeevon ki photography kar rahe hai** (If specifically photographing small creatures).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vanyajeev photography ke liye aksar ek lambe telephoto lens ke aavashyakta hoti hai, haalaanki pakshiyon ke jhund yaa ek chhote praniyon ke photography ke liye anya lens ke aavashyakta hoti hai.""  This directly translates to ""Wildlife photography often requires a long telephoto lens, *however* other lenses are needed for photographing flocks of birds or *small creatures*.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Agar photographs ka upayog paise kamane ke lie kiya jata hai:**  The passage mentions regulations *about* earning money with photos, but doesn't say it affects lens choice.
* **C: Agar photo kheenche jane wale janwar sharmile hain:**  Shyness of the animal doesn't dictate the type of lens.
* **D: Agar kisi park mein vanyajeevon ki photography ke lie khaas niyam hain:**  Rules are mentioned, but don't relate to lens requirements.



"
Passage mein nimnalikhit mein se kiska ullekh vanyajeev photographers ke lie sambhaavit chunauti ke roop mein nahin kiya gaya hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Aavashyak lens ke prakaar ko source karna (Sourcing the necessary type of lens)**.

Here's why:

The passage mentions the *need* for different lenses (telephoto, wide-angle etc.) for wildlife photography. It doesn't state that *finding* or *sourcing* those lenses is a challenge.  It only says what lenses are *required* for different situations.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned as challenges:

*   **A: Kuch anokhe jaanvaron ko khojana (Finding some unique animals)** - The passage explicitly states ""kayee anokhe jaanvaron ko khojana mushkil hai"" (finding many unique animals is difficult).
*   **B: Aakramak jaanvaron se nipatana (Dealing with aggressive animals)** - The passage says ""Jangli janwar sharmile yaa aakramak ho sakte hain"" (Wild animals can be shy or aggressive).
*   **D: Sambhaavit pratikool paryavaran mein kaam karna (Working in potentially adverse environments)** - The passage states ""paryaavaran thanda, garm hona chaahiye yaa anyatha pratikool ho sakta hai"" (the environment can be cold, hot, or otherwise unfavorable).

Therefore, sourcing the lenses isn’t identified as a challenge in the provided text."
Pahadi darron se yatra karne vale driver ko nimnalikhit mein se kaunsi samasyaon ka sabse kam samna karna padta hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Bahut zyada traffic (Heavy traffic)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that in many countries with cold and snowy conditions, ""traffic poore saal zyaadaatar binaa rukawat chalta rahta hai"" which means traffic generally *doesn't* get disrupted. 

The passage specifically highlights these as problems for drivers in mountains/high elevations:

*   **Kam gharshan (Low friction):** Mentioned as a direct consequence of ice and snow.
*   **Drishyata kam hona (Reduced visibility):** Due to snowfall or condensation on windows.
*   **Atyadhik sanghanan (Excessive condensation):** Also contributing to reduced visibility.

Therefore, heavy traffic is the least likely problem according to the text."
Vibhin deshon mein aaykar mein kya chiz ek saman rehne ki adhik sambavna hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Darein**.

Here's why:

The passage states that tax *structures* and *brackets* vary greatly between countries. It also mentions different levels of taxation (federal and local) in some countries. However, it doesn't suggest that the *rates* themselves are completely different. While specific rates *within* a bracket will vary, the general idea of tax rates (e.g., a progressive system where higher income is taxed at a higher rate) is something that might be *more* consistent across countries, even if the actual percentages differ.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sanrachana (Structure):** The passage explicitly states tax structures are different.
*   **C: File karne ki jagah (Filing Location):** This will depend on residency and income sources, and is definitely not universally the same.
*   **D: Bracket (Brackets):** The passage states that brackets vary significantly.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, agar aap videsh mein kam kar rahe hain lekin rehne vale kahi aur ke hain, to apna income tax kaha file karenge?","The correct answer is **A: Apne rehne vale asthan par** (At your place of residence).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jab tak aap videsh mein kam karne waale diplomat nahin ho jiska samanya arth yah hai ki aapko us desh mein income tax bharna hoga, **jismein aap rehte hain**."" (Unless you are a diplomat working abroad, which generally means you have to pay income tax in the country **where you reside**.)

The passage directly links tax filing to your place of residence, *not* where you are working.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: America mein** - The passage mentions America as an example of a country with federal and local taxes, but doesn't state you *must* file there.
*   **C: Ush desh mai jahan aap abhi kaam kar rahe hain** - This is incorrect, as the passage emphasizes residence, not work location.
*   **D: Jaha bhi shulk sabse kam ho** - The passage doesn't suggest that you can choose to file based on the lowest tax rate."
Nimnalikhit mein se kaunsa kathan World Fair ke baare mein sahi se nahi batata?,"The correct answer is **D: Deshon ko bhaag lene ki aavashyakata nahi hai.**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Bhaag lene waale desh..."" (Participating countries...) This directly implies that countries *do* participate in World Fairs.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, according to the passage:

*   **A: Kisi desh ke itihas or sanskriti ko pradarshit kiya gaya hai** - The passage says, ""...apne desh ke sanskriti aur itihas ko pradarshit karne ke liye national pavilions..."" (to exhibit their country's culture and history in national pavilions).
*   **B: Kalaatmak aur shaikshik pradarshan ke sath sath vanaspati udyaan ko pradasharni dikhaya gaya hai** - The passage states, ""national pavilions mein kalaatmak aur shaikshik pradarshan prastut karte hain"" (present artistic and educational exhibitions in national pavilions) and also mentions ""Antarrashtriya baghwani pradarshani...vanaspati udyaan"" (International Horticultural Exhibition... botanical gardens).
*   **C: Ye ayojan chhah mahine tak chal sakte hain** - The passage states, ""Aam taur par ye ayojan teen se chhah mahine ke bich kabhi bhi..."" (Generally these events are organized anytime between three to six months...).

Therefore, only option D contradicts the information provided in the passage.



"
Nimnalikhit mein se kaunsa World’s Fair ya antarrashtriya pradarshani ka niyam hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Ayojan adhiktam chhah mahine tak chalna chahiye** (The event should last a maximum of six months).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Aam taur par ye ayojan teen se chhah mahine ke bich kabhi bhi Aisi jagahon par aayojit kiye jaate hain..."" (Generally, these events are organized anywhere between three to six months...).  This directly addresses the duration of a World's Fair.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pradarshani mein desh ke itihas aur duniya ki samasyaon dono ko dikhaya jana chahiye** (The exhibition should show both the country's history and the world's problems) - The passage says countries *can* display either their culture/history *or* global problems, not necessarily both.
* **B: Ek hi desh prativarsh ayojano ki mezbaani nahi kar sakta** (The same country cannot host the event every year) - The passage explicitly states this *isn't* the case: ""Yadyapi siddhant roop mein way prativarsh jagah le sakte hain..."" (Although in theory they could take place every year...).  It then clarifies they don't in practice.
* **D: Fair ke ayojan ke liye sabhi deshon ko bhag lena chahiye** (All countries must participate in the organization of the fair) - The passage doesn't mention a requirement for all nations to participate. It just says participating countries present exhibits.



"
inmein se kaunsa kaam karne se janwar ke hamle ki sambavana kam ho jayegi?,"The correct answer is **B: Shivir se khachra hatana** (Removing trash from the campsite).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...iske alawa, is baat se avagat rahein ki gandhak bhalu aur anya vanyajeevon ko aakarshit karte hain, isliye gandhyukt khaadya padarthon ko le jaane yaa pakane se bachein aur shivir saaf rakhein."" ( ""...also, be aware that sulfur attracts bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking smelly food items and keep the campsite clean."") This directly links keeping the campsite clean (removing trash) to reducing the attraction of animals, thus lowering the risk of an attack.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sugandhit jadee-bootiyan le jaana** (Bringing fragrant herbs) - The passage warns *against* bringing things with strong smells.
* **C: Bhediyon se 25 yard ki doori banayein rakhna** (Maintaining a 25-yard distance from wolves) - The passage states to keep *at least* 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and *at least* 25 yards/meters from *other* wild animals.  While maintaining distance is good, it's not the specific action highlighted as preventative.
* **D: Bache hue bhojan se janavaron ko rokna** (Preventing animals from eating leftover food) - The passage focuses on *not attracting* animals with food in the first place, not trying to stop them once they are already interested.



"
Nimnalikhit mein se kiska ullekh passage mein vanyajeevon ke hamalon ke sambhaavit karan ke roop mein nahin kiya gaya hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Aise janwar jo insaanon se aparichit hain (Animals unfamiliar with humans)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    *   **Tez gandh (Strong smells):** It states sulfurous smells attract bears and other wildlife, and to avoid bringing smelly foods. (A)
    *   **Doori banaye rakhein mein viphalata (Failure to maintain distance):** The passage heavily emphasizes keeping a safe distance from animals and states many injuries occur because visitors don't. (B)
    *   **Vanyajeevon ko khana khilana (Feeding wildlife):** The passage suggests not feeding animals. (C)

*   **The passage does *not* mention animals being unfamiliar with humans** as a cause for attacks. It focuses on the inherent wild and potentially dangerous nature of the animals themselves, regardless of their familiarity with people.



Therefore, option D is the one not mentioned in the passage as a cause for wildlife attacks."
