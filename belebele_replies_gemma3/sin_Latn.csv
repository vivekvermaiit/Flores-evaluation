"mema chedayata anuwa, nivaeradiva Ekodiyan wadanaya kirima sandaha niwaeredi igiyak lesa saelakillata gaeneemata nohaekke kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: vaedipura shabdayak labaa gaeneema sandaha, yaturu matha yodana balaya vaedi karanna** (meaning: understanding words well and using reason and intelligence).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) emphasizes the importance of thoughtful speech.** It stresses avoiding hasty words, considering consequences, and using language constructively. It states that relying solely on eloquent speech isn't enough; one needs *wisdom* to use it effectively.
* **Option A directly reflects this need for wisdom and reasoning.**  ""Vaedipura shabdayak labaa gaeneema sandaha, yaturu matha yodana balaya vaedi karanna"" highlights understanding words *and* applying reason/intelligence.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B:** Focuses on self-preservation, which isn't the core message.
    * **C:**  Talks about writing, which isn't the primary focus of the passage – it's about *speaking*.
    * **D:**  Emphasizes *action* through words, but the passage stresses *thoughtful* words, not just active ones.



Therefore, option A best captures the key takeaway from the provided text."
"Ekodiyan wadanaya karana wita, shabdaya vaedi kirimata upakaaree wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: vaedi balaya (വേദി බලයා - stage power/presence)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) repeatedly emphasizes the importance of confidently and powerfully delivering a speech (wadanaya).** It talks about overcoming fear, gaining stage presence (""aegili amathara balayakin chalanaya""), and not needing elaborate stage effects (""vaedipura balayak yedimata awashya novana"").  
* **The question (Q) asks what helps with verbal communication.**  The passage strongly suggests that *how* you deliver the speech – your stage presence and confidence – is more important than anything else.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: vaedi wegaya (വേദി വേഗത - stage speed):** While pacing is important, the passage focuses on power and confidence, not just speed.
    * **C: adu peedanaya (അඩු പീഡനയ - low pressure):** The passage is about *overcoming* pressure, not having low pressure.
    * **D: adu aegili chalanaya (അඩු ഏജിലി ചലനയ - low agility movement):** Again, the emphasis is not on physical agility, but on confident delivery.



Therefore, **vaedi balaya (stage power/presence)** is the most direct answer to the question, as it encapsulates the key message of the passage regarding effective public speaking."
rupavahiniye pinthura wala paethi maim kappadu kerenne aeyi?,"The correct answer is **A: upasiraesi sandaha ida labaa deemata** (Do you get the idea of covering the bottom part with pictures?).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Enisaa, rupavahiniya thula oba dakina siyalle ihala, pahala saha paethi maim kappadu kara atha."" (Therefore, cover the top, bottom, and sides of the television with pictures.)  The question asks specifically about covering the *bottom* part (paethi maim).
* **The passage then elaborates:** describing *how* to cover the bottom with pictures to create a complete visual covering.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pinthuraya thiraya sampurnayen pireema sandaha** (Do you get the idea of completely covering the picture?) - While covering the screen is the *goal*, the question is specifically about the *bottom* part.
* **C: saralawa wenath aakruthi walata pariwarthanaya kirimata ida deema sandaha** (Do you get the idea of simply changing the shape?) - This is about changing the overall *form* of the TV, not covering it with pictures.
* **D: upasiraesi pahala maimata wada aasanna kirima sandaha** (Do you get the idea of approaching the bottom part?) - This is about the *process* of getting to the bottom part, not the action of covering it.



Therefore, option A directly addresses the question posed based on the information in the provided text."
mema chedayata anuwa DVD aakruthiyata chit‍rapatayak pariwarthanaya kirime dee muhuna deemata ida aethi gaetaluwa pahatha sandahan gaetaluwalin kumak wiya haekida?,"The correct answer is **C: sampurna thiraya aawaranaya karana rupayak** (a form that completely covers the screen).

Here's why:

The passage (P) describes wanting to convert a movie to DVD format and emphasizes the desire for the image to **completely fill the screen** (""rupa sampurna tiraya aawaranaya karanu pinisaya"").  It talks about adjusting top, bottom, and sides to achieve this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sampurna thiraya aawaranaya nokarana rupayak** (a form that doesn't completely cover the screen) - This is the opposite of what the passage wants.
*   **B: ardha washayen kapaa daemunu upasiraesi** (partially covering the black bars) - While mentioned as something *to avoid*, it's not the desired outcome.
*   **D: kapa daemunu paethi maim** (black bars on the sides) - This is explicitly what the passage wants to eliminate.

The question (Q) asks about the form *resulting from* the conversion.  The passage clearly states the goal is complete screen coverage. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.



"
ehi b‍rithan‍ya hamuda balakotuvak pihita thibune koheda?,"The correct answer is **C: bordantavun**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...General John Cadvolder, sahayak sena kisivak paminenne nam eya avahira karanu pinisa **bordantavunhi** brithanya hamuda balakotuvata erehiva haeravum praharayak diyath karanu atha.""

This directly translates to: ""...if Assistant Secretary of War Cadwalader, approached the British fortified camp at **Bordentown**, he would direct a strike to harass them.""

Therefore, the British fortified camp was located at Bordentown.



"
athin liyana lada ketumpathe dis wu athsana kaageda?,"The correct answer is **A: John Dunlap**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...godanagili kipayak obben pihiti John Dunlap ge mudranalayata yavana ladi."" (The copy was sent to John Dunlap's printing press).  It also refers to the publication as the ""dunlap broadside"". This clearly indicates John Dunlap was the one who printed the document.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: George Washinton** - He *received* a copy on July 9th, he didn't print it.
*   **C: John Nixon** - He was the first to publicly read the declaration on July 8th, not print it.
*   **D: Chaals Thompsan** - He is mentioned alongside John Hancock, but not as the printer.



"
"pahatha sandahan sthaana atharin, dunlap brodside ekak awasan warata paeminiye kothaenada?","The correct answer is **C: landan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""agosthu 10 wanada ek pitapatak **landanaya** wetha laebini."" (On August 10th, a copy was sent to London).  This directly indicates a copy of the Dunlap broadside reached London.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: nivyork** - While Washington read it in New York, the question asks where a *copy* was sent.
*   **B: dunlapge mudranalaya** - The broadside originated *from* Dunlap's printing shop, but wasn't *sent to* it.
*   **D: indipendans hol** - This location is not mentioned in the text.



"
kerrnal starkge bhatayin sthanagathakara thibune koheda?,"The correct answer is **A: uthuru kelavare, mayima dige**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Starkge minisun yatath janapadavaesiyange sthanaye **uthuru kelavare mayima dige sthanagatha viya.**""  This directly translates to ""Stark's men were stationed to the **north of the civilian settlement, towards the south.**""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: jala addara werala theerayaka** - This refers to a location near a riverbank, which isn't where Stark's men were stationed.
*   **C: ardhadvipaye uthuru naegenahira dige** - This describes a location on the northern side of a peninsula, which isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **D: mayima idiripita** - This means ""southern side,"" which is the *opposite* direction of where Stark's men were.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, starkge minisun owunge vaeta digu kale kawadada?","The correct answer is **B: nith‍ya bhatayin kanuwa pasu kala pasuwa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Starkge minisun yatath janapadavaesiyange sthanaye uthuru kelavare mayima dige sthanagatha viya. Badiya magin ardhadvipaye isaana desin mystic ganga dige hidaesak vivurta kala vita, ovun itha ikmanin kudaa verala tirayaka jala addara avasan wana keti gal pavurakin vaeta uthurata digu kalaha.

This translates to: ""Stark's men were stationed north of the civilian settlements. ...Girdley and Stark had a fixed position about 100 (30 meters) apart, and **they were constantly watching each other so that nothing unexpected happened in the battle.**""  The phrase ""nitya bhatayan eya pasu kara yana tek"" means constantly watching/observing each other.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: yatath vijithavadeen siy hamuda shaktimath kireemata illa sitiya dee** - This refers to a general statement about being victorious without a powerful army, not Stark's specific actions.
*   **C: adu badiya atharathura** - This refers to being near a stream, which isn't directly what Stark's men were doing.
*   **D: bhatayin idiripasa sthaanawalata aethulu wana atharathura** - This refers to approaching or arriving at battle positions, not the ongoing observation.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, chinaye wadathma p‍rachandakaaree yugayan walin ekak wuye pahatha sandahan kumana yugayada?","The correct answer is **B: shiyaan yugaya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...purathana chinaye vaediyenma le thaevarunu yugayak woo athara, **shiyaanhi maha maligaye ihalama asunata yamata satan karamin dahas ganan minissu miya giyaha**.""  This directly links a devastating period in ancient China to the Shiyaan (Xi'an) imperial palace and immense suffering.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: jinn rajawanshaya** - The passage mentions the ""jinn rajawanshaya"" as lasting 60 years, but doesn't describe it as a particularly devastating era. It's a time *before* the described suffering.
*   **C: han rajawanshaya** - The passage doesn't focus on the Han dynasty.
*   **D: thun-rajadhaani yugaya** - While the passage mentions a capital city being moved, it doesn't name a ""Thun-rajadhaani yugaya"" or characterize it as particularly brutal.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, hamuda kuhumbu kandayamak sancharaka awadhiyakata aethulu vime sath‍yaya kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: owun dina 17 kata pasu wenas karana lada koodu sadai** (They will be ready to depart on the 17th day).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mema saema agamika kalabaeganiyak ho pagamanak asanna washayen dina 17k pawathee.""  This directly translates to ""This family is preparing to depart on the 17th day.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: owun rath‍ree kaalaye koodu sadai** (They always travel at night) - The passage states they *sometimes* travel at night, but not always.
* **B: owunta adu aahara saepayimak aetha** (They bring food with them) - While they *start* their journey with food, it doesn't say they *always* bring food.
* **D: owun divaa kalayedee gaman karai** (They travel during the day) - The passage states they *don't* travel during the day.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, sancharaka awadhiyedee hamuda kuhumbu kandayamwala koodu saedeeme purudu niwaerediwa pilibimbu karanne kumana p‍rakaashayada?","The correct answer is **C: owun dainikawa koodu wenas karai** (They make daily arrangements for food).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Pawathina aahara adu wo vita kolaniya sancharaka avadhiyak aarambha karayi. mema avadhiye dee, kolaniya sadanne dainikawa venas kerena thavakalika koodu ya.""  This translates to: ""They begin the journey with sufficient food for the return. During this journey, they regularly make daily arrangements for food.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: owun rath‍i kalayedee koodu sadai (They stay overnight):** While the passage mentions traveling at night, it doesn't focus on *staying* overnight as a regular practice.
* **B: owun dina 17k thisse kooduwalata noyaa gaman karai (They don't travel past the 17th day):** The passage states they will reach their destination around the 17th day, not that they won't travel past it.
* **D: owun mema awadhiya sandaha ekama koodu bhawitha karai (They only consider food for this journey):** The passage explicitly mentions food for the *return* journey as well (""sufficient food for the return"").



"
bahira ingi aethi witadeeth pahatha sandahan dae athurin digatama pawathinu aeththe kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: antharaasarga chack‍ra**.

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

The text states: ""...*kayika vidyave ha haesirime boho ridmayan boho vita theeranatmaka lesa randha pawathinne **antharaasarga chackra** pawatheema saha jiva vidyatmaka oralosu haraha eva nispadanaya kireema mata ya.*""  (This translates to something like: ""...the body's knowledge and the suffering of living beings are produced by the **internal secretory system** and living energy fields..."")

The question (Q) asks what is seen outside, after passing through.  The text links the *antharaasarga chackra* (internal secretory system) to the *production* of what we experience.  Therefore, the *antharaasarga chackra* is the origin point related to what is perceived externally.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: aavartita ridmayan (recurring disease):**  The text mentions recurring disease but doesn't link it to what's *seen* externally.
*   **C: jiva vidyatmaka oralosu (living energy fields):** While mentioned, these are described as *produced* by the chackra, not what is being observed coming from within.
*   **D: nireekshanaya karana lada ridmayan (disease observed by inspection):** This is a description of how a disease is identified, not a system that generates observable phenomena.



"
kisiyam lakshanayaka vichal‍yathavayan penwana pudgalayan wisthara karana wachanaya kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: bahurupee**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Thani pudgalayan yam kisi nishchita gathi lakshanayaka vichalyathavayan kihipayak penwana vita ovun bahurupi we.""  This translates to ""Individual entities, deviating from any fixed characteristic, become multifaceted/diverse.""

* **Question (Q) asks:** Which term describes entities deviating from a specific characteristic?

* **""Bahurupee""** directly translates to multifaceted, diverse, or polymorphic - perfectly aligning with the description in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ekarupee (uniform/single form):** This is the *opposite* of what the passage describes.
* **B: jivin (living):**  While the passage mentions ""jivin,"" it's not the core concept relating to the deviation of characteristics.
* **C: jivin visesha (living species):**  Too specific; the passage talks about *individuals* not just species.



Therefore, **bahurupee (D)** is the most accurate answer."
kisiyam p‍radeshayaka vasaya karana jivin sandaha niwaeredi yeduma pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **D: bahurupee** (varied/diverse).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Thani pudgalayan yam kisi nishchita gathi lakshanayaka vichalyathavayan kihipayak penwana vita ovun bahurupi we.""  This translates to: ""Individual organisms, not limited to any specific behavioral characteristics, are diverse.""

* **The question (Q) asks:** ""What is the result of living beings inhabiting a particular region exhibiting different behaviors?""

* **Bahurupee (diverse)** directly answers this.  If organisms in a region *don't* have fixed behaviors, they will be diverse in their actions and adaptations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ekarupee (uniform/same):** This is the *opposite* of what the passage and question describe.
* **B: janagahanaya (population):** While related to the passage's topic, it doesn't answer what happens with *behavioral* differences.
* **C: jivin visesha (species):** This refers to the type of living thing, not the resulting diversity of behavior.



Therefore, **bahurupee (D)** is the best and most accurate answer."
sobadhahama matha padanamkaragath sanchaaraka kriyaakaarakamakata udaharanayak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **D: krumeen lesa wana dae haraha masun aelleema**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) specifically mentions ""masun aellima"" (types of mushrooms) and details about foraging for them, how they are used, and knowledge about them being passed down.** It highlights this as an example of local knowledge shared by local actors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: diya aellak wetha yaamata kandu naegeema (finding fish in the river by looking at the water)** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **B: wanamal jaayaarupakaranaya (forest tools/equipment)** - While tools *might* be used, the passage focuses on the *knowledge* of what to gather, not the tools themselves.
* **C: widyaa kavuthukaagarayak naerabima (building a knowledge center)** - This is a modern addition and not something described as a traditional local practice in the text.

Therefore, the passage provides **masun aelleema (mushroom foraging)** as a clear example of local knowledge being shared.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, p‍ravaahana paddhathiye padanama wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: pudgalika motor ratha** (individual motor vehicles).

Here's why:

The passage discusses a situation where people are increasingly relying on their own motor vehicles for commuting, leading to traffic congestion. It then mentions the need for a system to manage this influx of ""pudgalika motor ratha"" (individual motor vehicles) to alleviate congestion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: raekiyaa gamanantha** (railway transport) - While potentially a solution to traffic, the passage doesn't specifically focus on or mention railway transport.
*   **C: sthaawara jaiwa golayak** (stationary biosphere) - This is a more abstract concept related to environmental impact, not the immediate problem of traffic.
*   **D: minis parinamaya** (human consequences) - This is a broader outcome of the situation, not the specific thing being addressed in the context of traffic management.

Therefore, **pudgalika motor ratha** is the most directly related to the problem and the proposed solution described in the passage.



"
n‍yashtiya wata kakshagatha wana anshu walata kumana aakaaraye aaropanayak thibeda?,"The correct answer is **A: dhana aaropanayak** (positive charge).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Protonavala dhana viduli aaropanayak aethi namuth newtronavalata viduli aaropanayak naetha.""  This translates to: ""Protons have a positive electrical charge, but neutrons have no electrical charge.""
* **The question asks:** About the charge of particles *within* the nucleus (which contains protons and neutrons).
* Since protons have a positive charge and neutrons are neutral, the nucleus overall has a positive charge due to the presence of protons.

Therefore, the answer is a positive charge.



"
n‍yashtiya samanwitha wanne kumana anshu walin da?,"The correct answer is **A: protona saha newtrona** (protons and neutrons).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Nyashtiya- newtrona ha protona lesa ansu dekakin samanvitha we.""  This translates to ""The nucleus is composed of neutrons and protons."" 

Therefore, the nucleus is formed by the combination of protons and neutrons. The other options include electrons, which orbit the nucleus, but are *not* part of the nucleus itself.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, ilakkam pahaka dvimaya sankyaankayakata udaharanayak wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The question asks for an example of a binary number (dvimaya sankhya). A binary number consists only of 0s and 1s.

Let's look at the options:

*   **A: 1010** - This contains only 0s and 1s.
*   **B: 12001** - This contains the digit '2', which is not allowed in a binary number.
*   **C: 10010** - This contains only 0s and 1s.
*   **D: 110101** - This contains only 0s and 1s.

Since the question asks for *an* example, multiple answers could technically be correct. However, option A is the simplest and most straightforward example. The question also gives a short example of a binary number (0 or 1) initially.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: 1010**.  It's a valid binary number.
"
dvimaya sankyaanka handunwanu labanne pahatha ewayin kumak lesada?,"The correct answer is **A: bits**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""...mema sankhyaa dvimaya sankhyaanka lesa handunvayi - nathahoth pariganaka wanmaalawa thula bit lesa haedinve.""  This translates to ""...this number is represented by binary digits - otherwise, it is stored as a series of bits in the computer's memory.""

Therefore, the passage directly links representing numbers in binary to using **bits**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: agayan (digits):** While binary uses digits (0 and 1), the core unit of storage in a computer is the bit, not just the digit itself.
* **C: prabhashawa (illumination/influence):**  This is irrelevant to the context of binary numbers and computer storage.
* **D: porama (parameters):** This also doesn't relate to the fundamental way binary numbers are handled in computers.



"
pahatha sandahan karunu atharin blogkarana sisunta aethi mulika p‍rathilabhayak lesa chedaye sandahan nowana karuna kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: vyakarana ha livime kusalatha vaedi diyunu kirima** (developing grammar and writing skills).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**sisu sisuwiyan boho vita ovunge blog athdaekima alasa vyakarana ha akshara vinyasaya samaga aarambha karana athara...**"" which translates to ""Children begin their blog writing with basic grammar and spelling...""  This directly links blog writing to the development of fundamental language skills.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: sama wayase mithurangen vivechna adu vima** (exchanging critical thoughts with peers of the same age): While blog commenting *could* lead to this, the passage doesn't directly identify it as a primary benefit of blog writing *for the child*.
* **C: avata lokaya pilibanda awabodhaya pulul kirima** (developing an understanding of the world): The passage mentions the blog helps children ""develop intelligent ideas about their world,"" but this is a *result* of the writing process, not the initial benefit.
* **D: thawaduratath igeneemata aethi aashawa vaedi kirima** (developing a desire to learn from others):  The passage mentions that blog writing is encouraged, but doesn’t state that it develops a desire to learn from others as a primary benefit.



"
pahatha daekwena blogkarana angayangen kumana angaya sisunge liweeme kusalatha vaedi diyunu kirimata pelambavimak lesa sandahankara thibeda?,"The correct answer is **A: antharjalaye aethi drawya walata kriyaasheeleewa p‍rathichaara daekvima** (actively responding to online content).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Blog sudusu lesa bhavitha kireema """"sisunta vadaat vislesanaatmaka ha vivechanaatmaka weemata bala gaenviya haekiya; **antharjaala drawya valata kriyaashiliva prathichaara daekweema tulin sisunta an ayage lekhanavala sandarbhaya thula ovunge sthavaraya nirvacanaya kala haeki** athara visheshitha karana sambandhayen ovunge idiridarshana genahaera daekviya haekiya (oravek, 2002).""""

This translates to: ""The blog contributes to strengthening analytical and critical thinking in children; **especially their ability to actively respond to online content, which helps them develop their own stance in relation to their writing and understand their interactions with others.**""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: vivechna walakwa gaeneemata aethi aashawa** (having a lack of critical thought) - The passage actually emphasizes *developing* critical thinking, not lacking it.
* **C: p‍rekshakayange unanduwa pawathvagena yaama** (being limited by audience preferences) - While audience awareness is mentioned, it's not the *primary* skill the blog helps develop.
* **D: sahayogeethawaye awashyathawaya** (the need for collaborative support) - Collaboration is mentioned as helpful, but not the core skill being fostered.



"
sisun sandaha aesinkronas sannivedanaye p‍rathilabhayak nowanne pahatha sandahan karunuwalin monavada? ,"The correct answer is **A: mulashrayak lesa antharjalaya bhawitha kirima (utilizing the internet as a foundation)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on asynchronous communication (Aesinkronas sannivedanaya) and how the internet (antharjaalaya) and World Wide Web provide opportunities for students to access learning materials.**  It directly states this in the first sentence. The passage then elaborates on how this allows students to ask questions and receive responses *at their own pace* - a hallmark of asynchronous learning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: dawase onaema welawaka upadeshakayin wetha muhunata muhuna p‍raweshaya (direct access to the teacher during office hours):**  The passage contrasts this *with* asynchronous learning.  Office hours imply synchronous interaction.
* **C: nam‍yashili vaeda karana welawan (the time taken to receive a response):** While the passage *mentions* response time, it's not the defining characteristic of how students benefit from asynchronous communication. It's a *result* of it, not the core benefit.
* **D: wega palanaya (speed of delivery):**  Again, speed is a factor but not the *primary* benefit discussed. The benefit is about flexibility and self-paced learning, which relies on the internet as the delivery platform.



Therefore, option A best encapsulates the central idea of the passage regarding how students benefit from asynchronous communication – by leveraging the internet as a primary learning tool."
"mema chedayata anuwa, aesinkronas sannivedanaye pahatha sandahan angawalin sisunta nam‍yashii nowana anga kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: upadeshathmaka drawya (instructional materials)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Emagin sisyayanta thamage ma wegayen wada kireeme saha **upadeshathmaka toraturuvala vegaya palanaya kireeme** haekiyaawa aetikarayi.""  This translates to ""...it is important to communicate with students in a way that is not my own and **effectively manage instructional materials**.""

The question asks what aspects of asynchronous communication are *helpful* to students. Instructional materials are directly mentioned as being managed effectively for the students' benefit within the context of asynchronous communication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: igeneeme wegaya (the speed of response)** - The passage discusses delays in response time, but doesn't frame speed as *helpful*. It acknowledges it as a characteristic.
*   **B: waeda karana welawan (the time of communication)** -  Similar to A, the passage speaks to time constraints but not as a positive aspect.
*   **D: antharjala bhawithaya (internet availability)** - While the internet is mentioned, it's about the *access* to resources, not a helpful *aspect* of the communication itself.



"
madhya kaaleena maliga samaga sambandha kala haeki deyak lesa chedaye sandahan nowanne kumakda?,"The question asks what is connected to a medieval palace (madhya kaaleena maligava) from the provided text. Let's break down the text and the options:

The text describes a medieval palace with horses, food gathering, bravery, and a certain feeling. It also mentions battles, sounds, smells, and stories.

Now let's look at the options:

*   **A: Dangeyan walawal (Dungeons/Prisons):** While palaces *could* have dungeons, the text doesn't specifically mention them.
*   **B: Jost (Jousting):** The text mentions *ashva pora* (horse riding), which strongly suggests jousting or tournaments were taking place. This aligns with medieval palace life and displaying bravery.
*   **C: Veerathwaya (Bravery):** The text *mentions* bravery, but bravery itself isn't a physical component *of* a palace, it’s something that happens *within* it.
*   **D: Nayitwaru (Leadership/Governance):** While palaces are centers of governance, the text doesn’t focus on that aspect.

Therefore, the most direct connection to a medieval palace from the text is **jousting** as evidenced by the mention of horse riding.

**So the answer is B: Jost**

The paragraph heavily focuses on the smells and sounds of the past within the mansion – specifically, the smells of battles, the sounds of hundreds of words, and the scent of a pleasant aroma. 

Let's break down the options:

*   **A: satan (devil)** - The paragraph doesn't mention anything about devils.
*   **B: biya (fear)** - While there's mention of ""aghraanaya kirimata apahasu nove"" (not causing fear), fear isn't the *primary* association.
*   **C: bhojana sangraha (food collection)** - Food is mentioned, but is a minor detail in comparison to the sensory experiences.
*   **D: kura (stories/talk)** - The paragraph *explicitly* says ""sata sata shabdaya aessimata"" (hundreds of words came), and that's a core element of the experience within the maliga. The smells and sounds evoke tales of the past.

Therefore, the best answer is **D: kura (stories/talk)**. The maliga is associated with the echoes and remnants of past narratives and experiences.

karbi makselo maligaya pilibanda niwaeredi wistharayak wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: maligaye ghana biththi illa sitiye haesting samivarayaa wisini**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** describes a fortress (""karbi makselo maligaya"") with strong walls (""ghana biththi"") and mentions Hastings' siege (""haesting saamivaraya visin"").  The passage focuses on the fortress's defenses.
* **Q (the question)** asks about the details surrounding the fortress.
* **Option A** directly addresses the fortress's strong walls and the siege by Hastings, making it the most relevant and accurate answer based on the information in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** Focuses on calculations and time, which are present in the passage, but aren't the core detail asked for regarding the fortress itself.
* **C:** Says the fortress isn't a common topic, which isn't the focus of the passage.  The passage *describes* the fortress.
* **D:** Mentions defensive capabilities, but is more abstract and doesn't highlight the specific detail of strong walls and the siege like option A does.



"
mema chedaye wisthara kara aethi seemawa thula pahatha sandahan idikirim lakshana walin karbi makselo maligave asaaman‍ya lesa salakanu labanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: wishala kavulu** (vast doors).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a large, imposing structure.** It mentions ""vishaala opa daemuu kavulu"" (vast doors) and emphasizes its strength and resistance.  The question (Q) asks what feature helps identify the structure in a detailed way. Vast doors are a prominent and defining characteristic.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: praharawalata muhuna diya haeki lesa godanaegunu aththivarama (being able to turn away attacks)**: While the structure *is* resistant to attacks, this is a *result* of its construction, not a defining visual feature.
* **C: samahara maliga walata wada adu balakotu (a group of palaces or a lot of buildings)**: The passage doesn't indicate multiple buildings; it focuses on a single structure.
* **D: thuni biththi (pillar foundations)**: While foundations are important, they aren't a readily visible identifying feature.



Therefore, **A: wishala kavulu** best answers the question based on the information provided in the passage."
"mema chedayata anuwa, elabena irthuva sandaha sudanam wana duwannekuta wadath p‍rayojanawath wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: sisira irthuve dee gama haraha diweema puhunu vima**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""Sisira irthuve dee gama harahaa diweema saha shareeraye ihala kotasa sandaha kridaagaara vyaayaam kireema dhawana kaalaya sandaha wana hondama sudanama wei.""  (Sisira season, cool breezes, and exercise in the upper parts of the body in a gymnasium are good for health during running season).
* **The question (Q) asks:** what is beneficial for someone who runs during the cool season?
* **Option A** directly reflects this statement, mentioning Sisira season and cool breezes, connecting it to health (""puhunu vima"" - well-being/health).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:**  Talks about increasing speed and paying attention, which isn't the *primary* benefit mentioned in the passage.
* **C:** Focuses on the duration of running (ten minutes), which is just a detail and not the benefit.
* **D:** Mentions exercising the upper body, but this is *part of* the overall benefit of the season, not the benefit itself.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, palamu panthiye saethapum bhaga duwannekuta wadathma vaedgath wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: sheetha irthuve dee gama haraha diweema puhunu vima** (cooling the body with cold water after exercise/running).

Here's why:

The passage describes the benefits of running, specifically mentioning the importance of cooling down afterward. The line ""Sisira irthuve dee gama haraha diweema saha shareeraye ihala kotasa sandaha kridaagaara vyaayaam kireema dhawana kaalaya sandaha wana hondama sudanama wei"" directly translates to ""It is good to cool the body with cold water and engage in upper body exercises in the gym after running.""  The question asks what helps the runner recover *after* the run.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: wegayata wada vindadaragaeneeme shakthiya wardhanaya kirima** (increasing strength while gaining speed) - This refers to improving performance, not recovery.
* **C: miniththu dekakata adu kaalayak vaartha kirima** (spending ten minutes on it) - This is vague and doesn't specify *what* is being done for ten minutes.
* **D: vindadaragaeneeme shakthiyata wada wegaya wardhanaya kirima** (increasing speed while gaining strength) - Similar to B, this focuses on improvement, not recovery.

"malala kridakayeku sandaha, poshana kriyaa piliweth thulin pamanak labaa gatha nohaekke pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: vaedi diyunu kala karya saadhanaya** (ways to improve performance).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:**  ""Sudusu poshana kriya piliweth valin pamanak itha usas karya saadhanayak jananaya kala nohaeki...malala kridakayinge samastha yahapaevaetmata saelakiya yuthu lesa balapaem kala haeki ya...malala kridakayanta ovunge karya saadhanaya wadi diyunu karagaenimata..."" This translates to: ""Although it was not possible to create effective methods for improving performance through simple nutrition...it was possible to strengthen young athletes through various skillful techniques...to provide ways to improve their performance...""

* **The question (Q) asks:** What did the athlete lack, given they didn't get results from nutrition alone?

The passage directly states the lack was in *effective methods for improving performance* - and the solution found was to focus on *ways to improve performance* (karya saadhanaya wadi diyunu karagaenimata).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: vaedi thrupthiyak (satisfaction)** - While satisfaction is mentioned as a result of playing well, it's not what the athlete lacked *initially*.
* **C: wishishta karya saadhanaya (special performance methods)** - The passage implies a need for *any* improvement methods, not necessarily special ones.
* **D: saaman‍ya subhasadhanaya (general well-being)** - This is related to health, but the focus is on *performance*, not just general well-being.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, tharuna malala kridakayinta kridaven vaedi thrupthiyak labaa gaeneemata nirdesha nokaranne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **D: soukyamath shakthi thulayak pavatvagaenima** (Maintaining a balance of health and strength).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""...soukyamath shakti tulanayak pavatvagaenima, phaladayi sajalana purudu aethi karagaenima saha athireka bhavithavange vividha paetikadayan therum gaeneema tulin, malala kridakayanta ovunge karya saadhanaya wadi diyunu karagaenimata saha kridave yedimen thamanta labena truptiya wadi karagaenimata haekiya.""  This translates to: ""...Maintaining a balance of health and strength, consuming a fruitful and watery diet, and understanding the various limitations of excess, help young athletes achieve their goals and find satisfaction in their play.""

* **The question (Q) asks:** What does not help young athletes find satisfaction in their play?

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: nisi poshana piliweth pilipaedeema (Following a proper nutritional plan):** The passage *does* imply good nutrition is important.
* **B: wishishta mattamin saema witama krida kirima (Playing the right amount at the right time):**  Understanding limitations of excess (mentioned in the passage) ties into this, so it *helps*.
* **C: phaladayi lesa sajalanaya kirima (Consuming a fruitful diet):** This is directly mentioned as beneficial in the passage.

Therefore, the passage *doesn't* state anything about a lack of balance in health and strength preventing satisfaction. In fact, it states the *opposite* - that maintaining that balance *helps* find satisfaction.  The question is asking what *doesn't* help, so the best answer is **D**.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, maeda dura duwanneku wada mila adhika upakaranayak mila dee gaeneemata hethuwa kumak wiya haekida?","The correct answer is **C: eya owunge karya saadhanayata behewin balapanu aetha** (It strengthens their work efficiency).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses how having the right tools significantly impacts performance.** It states that without necessary equipment, even skilled individuals struggle, and true productivity isn't achieved.  It also implies that having the right tools helps overcome obstacles and leads to better outcomes.
* **The question (Q) asks *why* having more tools is beneficial.**
* **Option C directly addresses this benefit - improved work efficiency.**  Having tools helps people do their work *better* and *faster*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eya owunge pawudgalika kaemaettaki (It is their individual capacity):** The passage argues the opposite - that even skilled people need tools. It's not *just* about individual skill.
* **B: ehi oppu kala prathilabha aetha (There is a quick profit here):** The passage focuses on *productivity* and *quality of work*, not immediate profit.
* **D: adu milaethi upakarana pilibandawa vaeradi sankalpa aetha (It's a concept related to the necessary equipment):** This is a statement *about* the equipment, not *why* it's beneficial.  It's a circular argument.



Therefore, **C** is the most logical and directly supported answer based on the meaning of the passage."
"mema chedayata anuwa, maedi dura dhaawanayata awashya wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: boho upakarana (many tools/equipment)**.

Here's why:

* **P's text states:** ""...kese vethath sahabhaagivima sandaha awashya wana upakarana kihipayak sambandhava vaeradi akalpa bohomayak thibe.""  This translates to something like: ""...there are many complex relationships regarding the equipment necessary for those participating in this...""  This directly indicates a need for *many tools/equipment*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: sthaapitha malala krida pasubimak (established cricket playing fields):** The text doesn't specifically mention cricket or playing fields.
* **C: itha adu upakarana (this or that equipment):** The text emphasizes *many* pieces of equipment, not just a few specific ones.
* **D: wishala mudalak (large capital):** While funding might be *required* to obtain the equipment, the text focuses on the *equipment itself* as the necessity.

**Therefore, the question asks what is *required* for the described activity, and the text clearly points to ""boho upakarana"" (many tools/equipment).**



"
n‍yashtika chumbhaka anunadaya soyaagaththe kawuda? ,"The correct answer is **C: bloch saha parsel**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""MRI yanu 1930 gananvala dee philix bloch (stanfod vishwa vidyalaye sevaye niyuthu) saha edward parsel (harvad vishwa vidyalaye) visin soyagat, nyasthika chumbaka anunada (NMR) yana bhautika vidyaatmaka sansiddhiya matha padanam vuvaki.""  This translates to: ""The foundations of MRI were laid in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (employed by Stanford University) and Edward Parsel (Harvard University) regarding the physical and mathematical foundations of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).""

Therefore, Bloch and Parsel are credited with the discovery of nuclear magnetic resonance.



"
waidya rupakarana anunadaya sandaha palamu petant balapath‍raya labaa dunne kumana warshayeda? ,"The correct answer is **A: 1977**.

The passage states: ""Vasara hatarakata pasu petant balapatrayak labunu athara, eya  MRI  ksetraye nikuth karana lada palamu petant balapatrayai."" and then later ""1977 dee acharya Daemadiyan ohu visin """"yatath nokalaeki"""" lesa haedinvu palamu """"purna-kaaya""""  MRI  skaenaraya nirmanaya kireema sampurna karana ladi.""  This clearly indicates 1977 was the year the first functional MRI scanner was created.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, an ayage bhautika kriyaawan artha nirupanaya kirima sandaha minisunta daedi awabodhayak thibiya yuththe kumak pilibandawa da?","The correct answer is **D: awabodhaya (අවබෝධය)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses how people often misunderstand the *true nature* of things (like the motor rickshaw driver's skill) and instead attribute it to something else (the rickshaw itself).  The core point is about *understanding* the real cause and effect, and breaking through superficial perceptions.  

* **Awabodhaya (අවබෝධය)** directly translates to ""understanding,"" ""insight,"" or ""comprehension.""  The passage is fundamentally about the lack of proper *understanding* leading to misinterpretations.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **Aashawa (ආශාව)** - Desire.  While desire might play a role in some situations, it's not the central theme of the passage.
* **Abhip‍raya (අභිප්‍රාය)** - Intention or opinion. The passage isn't about someone's intent; it's about a lack of correct perception.
* **Visvasaya (විශ්වාසය)** - Belief.  The passage highlights a *misplaced* trust or belief (in the rickshaw, not the driver) due to a lack of understanding, not belief itself.



Therefore, **awabodhaya** best captures the essence of what the passage is questioning – the ability to correctly perceive and understand the underlying reality of physical actions and their causes."
"mema chedayata anuwa, abhip‍raya therum gaeneema minisunta kumak kirimata upakaaree weda?","The correct answer is **A: bhautika kriyaawan pitupasa aethi awinishchitha bawa iwath kirima** (acting without certainty about physical actions).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the idea that we often act *despite* not fully understanding the consequences or the mechanics of our actions.  The example of the motor vehicle illustrates this perfectly - we drive without needing to know *how* the engine works.  The key point is acting *regardless* of complete understanding of the physical processes involved.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: aashawan purokathanaya kirima** (telling stories based on desires) - While the passage touches on expectations, it's not the central point.
* **C: vinishchyakin thorawa an aya desa baeleema** (rejecting certainty and embracing this state) - The passage doesn't advocate *rejecting* certainty, but rather points out that we often operate *without* it.
* **D: an ayage manasa kiyavima** (clarifying one's own mind) - This is mentioned in the very beginning but isn’t the core message about *how* we act.



The passage is about how human action often precedes full understanding, a concept relating directly to acting without certainty about the physical processes. Therefore, **A** is the best fit."
"mema chedayata anuwa, kruthima buddhiya hi p‍radhaana aramuna pilibanda niwaeredi saranshayak wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **D: karyayan svayankreeyawa kirima** (task automation).

Here's why:

The passage repeatedly emphasizes how AI is used to automate tasks (""karyayan svayankreeyawa kirimata yanthrayakata haekiyaawa labadima"").  It describes AI performing functions previously done by humans, like identifying defects, making decisions, and even performing complex analyses. This core ability – automating tasks – is the primary focus of the text when discussing the benefits and applications of AI.

Let's look at why the other options are less fitting:

* **A: saelasum kirima** (challenging tasks) - While AI *can* tackle challenging tasks, the passage focuses more on *how* it does so through automation, not simply the difficulty of the task.
* **B: hada handunagaeneema** (decision making) - Decision making is a *result* of AI's automation, not the core principle discussed throughout the passage.
* **C: upalekhanagatha kirima** (recording tasks) - This isn't a primary function highlighted in the text.  AI does use data, but the focus is on *acting* on that data, not merely recording it.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, kruthima buddhiya boho wita sambandha wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kumak samagada?","The correct answer is **B: saelasum kirima saha upalekhanagatha kirima (sales and marketing)**.

Here's why, based on the provided text:

The text explicitly mentions:

* ""...*saelasum kireema saha palanaya kireema ema udaharanavalata ayat we*."" - ""...examples of sales and marketing are given.""
*  It also points out how AI can be used in various fields including economic studies, medicine, engineering etc. and this includes applications in marketing and sales.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: paaribhogika sewaya (consumer services)** - While AI *can* be used in consumer services, the text doesn't specifically highlight this as a primary benefit.
* **C: vdya prabandha (medical management)** - Medical management is mentioned, but not as the *main* focus of the examples given.
* **D: ath akuru handuna gaeneema (fraud detection)** - Fraud detection is mentioned, but again, not the primary example given or the overall scope.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer based on the context of the text."
"mema chedayata anuwa, abhisaree chinthana rataawan aethi ayekuge shakthiyak wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: gaetaluwakata niwaeredi pilithuru kihipayak handuna gaeneema** (providing a foundation/basis of established knowledge to the convergent thinking process).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of a ""nivaeradi pilithurak pamani"" (established foundation of knowledge) as crucial for this kind of convergent thinking.**  The text describes how this thinking relies on speed, logic, and accuracy, *built upon* existing understanding.  It's not about creating new knowledge (like divergent thinking), but *applying* existing knowledge.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: gaetalu wisandeema sandaha nawa thaakshana yoda gaeneema (being a new, quick warrior in solving problems):**  While speed is mentioned, the passage doesn’t portray this as a *new* or impulsive approach, but a skillful *application* of what's already known.
    * **C: gaetalu wisandeemata owunta awashya kaalaya gaeneema (requiring time to solve problems):**  The passage stresses *speed* (vegaya) as a key characteristic, making this option incorrect.
    * **D: ratawan mathakaye thabaa gaeneema (rejecting the ideas of others):** The passage doesn't mention rejecting others' ideas.  It focuses on logical and accurate *implementation* of existing knowledge, not dismissal of alternative thoughts.



Therefore, option A best reflects the passage's emphasis on needing a strong, established base of knowledge to effectively utilize convergent thinking."
"mema chedayata anuwa, abhisaree manasikathwaye kendraya lesa nosaelakenne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: ek niwaeredi pilithurak pamanak aethi bawa therum gaeneema**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mema manobhaavaye vaedagathma saadhakaya wanne: aeththe ek nivaeradi pilithurak pamani.""  (The practical application of this mindset is: to understand it as a simple, established rule.)  This directly links the core concept to a foundational rule or principle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ohuta awashya kaalaya labaa gaeneema (getting benefit from time)** - While potentially a result of good thinking, it's not the central *application* described in the passage.
* **C: karunu handuna gaeneema (becoming compassionate)** -  Compassion is mentioned as a quality *developed* through this thinking, not the direct application of it.
* **D: thorathuru raes kirima (making quick decisions)** - The passage describes careful consideration, not quickness.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer as it reflects the key takeaway about how to *use* this convergent thinking – by understanding it as a fundamental rule."
"mema chedayata anuwa, k‍shudra p‍rakaashanayak lesa nosaelakenne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The question asks what someone would do *less* when faced with minor publications and facial expression/body language interpretations (likely related to detecting lies).

The original text describes someone skilled in detecting deceit, particularly through subtle cues. They are described as being able to discern truth from falsehood *even when* stories are presented in a harmful or damaging way (molaye haani hetuven).  They are also described as clever and planning.

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: kathaa karana atharathura iwatha baeleema (Talking less and being more careful)** - This aligns perfectly with someone trying to detect lies.  They'd be *less* likely to talk a lot and more likely to observe.
* **B: nalale raeli gaeseema (Becoming easily angered)** - Anger would cloud judgment and make lie detection harder.
* **C: wegayen aesipiya gaeseema (Acting hastily)** - Hasty action would also hinder careful observation.
* **D: thambs ap ekak labaa deema (Trying to get a benefit)** - Focusing on personal gain would distract from the task of discerning truth.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: kathaa karana atharathura iwatha baeleema**.  A skilled lie detector would be more reserved and observant.



"
k‍shudra p‍rakaashanaya artha gaenvima pilibanda pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashawalin vaeradi wanne kumana p‍rakaashaya da?,"The correct answer is **C: kathanaya menma muhune iriyawda artha gaenwe** (the story is understood as it unfolds/through the expressions).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Video patigata kireem bhavithaya milithathpara kihipayakata pawathina kshudra prakaashana saha muhunu chalana artha kathanayehi"" - This translates to ""The story is told through small revelations and facial expressions in the video footage.""  This directly links understanding the story to observing facial expressions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: vidiyo patigata kireem saelakiya yuthu diyunuwakata hethu vi thibe** - This talks about the reason for including video footage, not *how* the story is understood.
* **B: niwaeredi artha nirupanaya wisin boruwa handunagatha haeka** - This focuses on avoiding misleading interpretations, which is a separate point.
* **D: eya awankabhawaya thakseru kirimata upakaaree we** - This refers to helping to reduce fear or apprehension and isn't the primary method of understanding the story.



Therefore, option C accurately reflects the passage's explanation of how the story’s meaning is conveyed."
punarudaye p‍rathiphalayak lesa wadath vaedgath wuye pahatha sandahan ewayin kumakda? ,"The correct answer is **B: daenuma vyaaptha kireema**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Saaranayak lesa, punarudaya igenime praveshaya ha **daenuma vyaaptha kireemehi saelakiya yuthu venasak sidu kale ya.**""  This translates to ""Essentially, the destructive power of worldly conditioning enters and expands with rebirth."" This directly links rebirth to the expansion of worldly conditioning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: pudgalika mathakaya (individual thought):** While the passage mentions *pudgalika* (individuals) it doesn't directly link rebirth to individual thought as a *result* of rebirth.
* **C: pela mathakaya (false thought):**  The passage doesn't focus on false thoughts as a consequence of rebirth.
* **D: thorathuru labaa gaeneema (various gains):** While gains are mentioned, they aren't presented as a *result* of rebirth, but rather a temporary aspect of it.

**Therefore, the passage directly states that the expansion of worldly conditioning (daenuma vyaaptha kireema) is a result of rebirth (punarudaya).**



"
punarudye p‍rathiphalayak lesa adu awadhaanayak labaa dee aeththe pahatha ewayin kumak sandaha da?,"The correct answer is **B: daenuma labaa gaeneema**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) focuses heavily on ""daenuma labaagaenime"" (spiritual merit/gain).** It discusses how seeking it leads to good rebirths, avoids suffering, and is more valuable than physical comfort.  The entire passage revolves around the importance of this spiritual gain.
* **The question (Q) asks what benefit one receives from rebirth.**  The passage directly links rebirth (""punarudaya"") to the accumulation of ""daenuma labaagaenime.""
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: pudgalika mathakaya (individual thought/mind)** - While the passage mentions thought, it's not the *result* of rebirth, but rather something influenced by actions.
    * **C: pela mathakaya (benefit of wisdom)** - Wisdom isn't specifically mentioned as a direct result of rebirth in the passage.
    * **D: thorathuru beda haereema (different kinds of suffering)** - The passage states accumulating merit *avoids* suffering, not that suffering is a result of rebirth.



Therefore, the passage clearly establishes that the benefit of rebirth (""punarudye prathiphalayak"") is rooted in the ""daenuma labaa gaeneema"" accumulated in previous lives."
sabandatha pawathva gaeneema sandaha antharjalaya bhawitha kirime abhip‍reranaya pilibimbu nokaranne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: pawule aya samaga sambandhatha pawathva gaeneema (understanding relationships with user groups)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses how the internet fosters a sense of community and connection.** It mentions ""pudgalika sambandhaya"" (individual connections) and ""akhanda sambandhataava"" (holistic connections) – meaning relationships between people.  The text explains how the internet *creates* these connections.
* **The question (Q) asks what motivates internet development *regarding* fostering relationships.**
* **Option B directly addresses this:** ""pawule aya samaga sambandhatha pawathva gaeneema"" refers to understanding and catering to the relationships people form, which aligns perfectly with the passage's discussion of connections.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: vyaapara jalakaranaya (commercial networking):** While commerce happens on the internet, the passage doesn't focus on business motivations.
* **C: sanchaara pilibanda paryeshana kirima (conducting communication research):** Research is *about* the internet, not a primary motivation *for* its development as described in the passage.
* **D: nawa pudgalayin hamuvima (attracting new individuals):** While gaining users is a consequence, it’s not the core *motivation* related to the relationship aspect discussed in the text.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer based on the content of the passage."
pudgalika sambandhaya sandaha antharjalaya bhawitha kirime abhip‍reranaya pilibimbu nokaranne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: margagatha sakachcha puwaruwaka pala kirima** (performing calculations based on readily available information).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses how the internet facilitates a sense of ""pudgalika sambandhaya"" (individual connection) and ""akhanda sambandhataava"" (seamless connection).** It specifically mentions James & Pirisa (1995) suggesting the internet's development was driven by a desire for ""igenima"" (identity) and ""samaajaayanaya"" (community).  Ayime & Maccord (1998) found that web users often verify information, relying on these connections.

* **""Pudgalika sambandhaya"" in this context implies people verifying information *through* their connections and available resources.** They aren't simply blindly accepting data.  They're using what they find *online* to form their own conclusions. This aligns perfectly with ""margagatha sakachcha puwaruwaka pala kirima"" -  calculating/forming opinions based on readily available information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: wattoruwak sevima (serving a single user):** The passage focuses on connections *between* users, not individual service.
* **C: sawukyaarak‍shaka nishpadana pilibanda paryeshana kirima (researching about security production):** Security isn't the primary focus of the passage.  It's about the *nature* of connection.
* **D: mudal kalamanakaranaya kirima (doing initial planning):** While the internet's development involved planning, the passage discusses the *result* of that planning – the feeling of connection and the way people use it.



Therefore, **B** best captures the essence of how the ""pudgalika sambandhaya"" within the internet's environment, as described in the passage, manifests itself."
batahira yuropaya balapaem matha daedi lesa randa siteema natharakara thamangema shailiyak vaedi diyunu kirimata aarambha kale kawadada?,"The correct answer is **A: madhyakaaleena yugaye awasanaya wana wita** (the end of the medieval era).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Madyakalina yugaye avasan bhagayata vannata batahira yuropaya ovungema shailiyak vaedidiyunu karagaenimata patan gatteya."" This translates to ""Towards the end of the medieval period, in Europe, they began to build in their own style.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: bisantianu yugaye dee (during the Byzantine era):** The passage mentions Byzantine culture as an *influence* but doesn't say the style *began* during that time.
* **C: madyakalina yugayen awurudu 25 kata pamana pasu (25 years into the medieval era):** The passage clearly links the style's beginning to the *end* of the medieval period.
* **D: 11 wana siyawase dee (during the 11th century):** While the passage mentions the 11th century (veni saha 11), it's referring to a prior time and doesn't connect it to the start of this building style.

boththam bhawithayen aendum thada kirimata hethu sadhakaya wuye kumakda? ,"The correct answer is **C: kurusa yuddha** (Crusade Wars).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ema kalaye siduvu visalatama sanvardhanayangen ekak vuye kurusa bhatayin aendum tada kirimata boththam bhavithaya aarambha kirimayi.""  This translates to ""...one of the expansions of this art during the Crusade Wars began the development of Buddhism.""

Therefore, the Crusades are directly identified as the reason for the beginning of Buddhist development in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: gothik yugaya (Gothic Era):** The passage mentions Gothic traditions, but doesn't link them to the *beginning* of Buddhist development.
*   **B: bisantianu yugaya (Byzantine Era):** The passage mentions Byzantine culture as an influence, but doesn't indicate it *caused* the Buddhist development.
*   **D: madyakalina yugaya (Medieval Era):** While the events occur within the medieval period, the passage specifically points to the Crusades as the catalyst.

"mema chedayata anuwa, parisarika gaetalu sandaha shak‍ya digukaaleena visandumak lesa salakanu labanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: p‍ramanaya ikmava yana sukhopabhogee jiwana rata thereem varjanaya kirima** (Avoiding a comfortable life focused on accumulating possessions).

Here's why:

* **The Passage's Core Message:** The passage laments a lifestyle driven by material gain (""gaetaluvala mula soya gatha yuthu athara"") and emphasizes that this pursuit leads to suffering and detachment from true value. It suggests a detachment from worldly desires is necessary for well-being.
* **The Question:** Asks what can be done to lessen environmental problems and achieve sustainable living.
* **Why A is the Best Fit:**  Reducing our focus on a comfortable, possession-driven lifestyle (sukhopabhogee jiwana rata) directly addresses the root cause of unsustainable consumption and environmental damage highlighted in the passage.  If people desire less material wealth, they will naturally consume less and lessen their impact.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: kriyaakaareethwaya (Action/Activity):** While action is important, the passage implies the *type* of action driven by desire is the problem.  Just *doing* things isn't the solution; it's *why* we do them.
* **C: gaetalu walata mul wana hethuwa handuna gaeneema (Finding the reasons for wanting wealth):** Understanding the *reasons* for wanting wealth doesn't address the problem itself.
* **D: paarisarika vyaapaaraye sagayeku bawata pathvima (Helping environmental businesses):** While supporting eco-friendly businesses is good, it's a downstream solution. The passage focuses on changing the fundamental values that drive destructive behavior.



Therefore, **A** best reflects the passage's underlying message about simplifying life and reducing materialistic desires as a key to a more sustainable future."
"mema chedayata anuwa, parisarika gaetalu sandaha roga lakshana p‍rathikaarayak lesa saelakillata ganu nolabanne pahatha sandahan visandumwalin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: gaetaluwe mula hethuwa akriya kireema** (doing nothing about the root cause of the problem).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) emphasizes inaction and the consequences of delaying action.** It states ""apata thaavakaalika visandumak awashya novanne nam, apa gaetaluvala mula soya gatha yuthu athara, eva akriya kala yutuya"" - meaning ""if we don't take timely action, we prolong the root cause of the problem, and this inaction itself is harmful.""  The passage describes a situation where people are aware of the problems (environmental issues, etc.) but don't act, leading to worsening conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kriyaakaaree katayuthuwala niratha vima** (being engaged with active doers) - The passage actually points *against* this, implying a lack of action.
* **C: p‍ramanaya ikmawana sukhopabhogee jiwana rataa thereem pilibanda adhas p‍rakaasha kirima** (shining light on a life of pleasure seeking and comfort) - This isn't the main focus of the passage. While the passage subtly criticizes a materialistic lifestyle, it's not the central point.
* **D: wadath parisara hithakaamee aakaarayakin jiwath vima** (living as a form dedicated to environmental benefit) - Again, the passage doesn't depict this; it describes a lack of such dedication.



Therefore, **B** most accurately reflects the main idea expressed in the passage – the detrimental effects of inaction regarding the root causes of problems."
agamika sandarbhayak pawathva gaeneemata wada bala thulanaya kenadreeya kotagath yuropaye palamu yuddhaya sidu wuye kumana rateda?,"The correct answer is **D: Spangnaya** (Spain).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Spangna anupraaptiya pilibanda yuddhaya, bala tulanaya pramukha gaetaluva kotagat palamu yuddhaya sanituhan kale ya.""  This translates to: ""The war regarding Spanish succession, was the first war that prominently featured the balance of power.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly links the balance of power to the war *regarding Spanish succession* - making Spain the answer.



"
"""awasana """"aagamika yuddhaya"""" lesa samahara wita wisthara kerena yuddhaya kumakda?""","The correct answer is **A: this awurudu yuddhaya** (the thirty years' war).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ebaevin tis avurudu yuddhaya agamika yuddhayak lesa nam kala haeki avasan yuddhaya viya.""  This directly translates to ""Thus, the thirty years' war, if called an incoming war, was the final war.""  

The passage frames the thirty years' war as the culmination of a period of conflict, referring to it as the ""incoming war"" that ended the era.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: siyawas yuddhaya** (seven years' war) - While significant, it's not explicitly identified as the ""final war"" in this passage.
*   **C: spangna uruma yuddhaya** (Spanish succession war) - Mentioned briefly as a precursor, but not the concluding conflict.
*   **D: spangna siwil yuddhaya** (Spanish civil war) - This is a much later conflict and not relevant to the historical context described in the passage.



"
katholika palliye siyum lesa pareekshaawata lak nokarana ladde pahatha sandahan anga atharin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: palliya thula balaya sankendranaya vima** (power was concentrated within the church).

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

* **The text explicitly states:** ""...devasthaanaye madyama adhikaariya avurudu dahasakata adhika kaalayak puravata romaye pawathi athara mema bala saha mudal sankendranaya ema siksava sapuranneda yanna pilibandava prashna paena naeguni.""  This translates to ""For over ten thousand years, the middle officials of the temple have not questioned how this power and capital were concentrated in Rome and how this teaching was implemented.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: palliya thula dhanaya wen kirima sudusu lesa paewathiye da yana bawa** (wealth entered the church through dubious means) - While the text hints at wealth accumulation, it doesn't focus on *how* it was obtained.
* **B: aagame p‍radhaana shikshaawa sanshodhanaya wiya yuthuda yana bawa** (struggle to revise the main teachings of the religion) - The text doesn't mention a struggle to revise teachings.
* **D: palliye p‍radhaana shikshaa sapura aethda yana bawa** (the main teachings of the church were implemented) -  The text *does* mention implementation, but the key issue highlighted is the *concentration of power* alongside that implementation.



Therefore, **C** directly addresses the core concern raised in the passage – the centralization of power within the Catholic Church."
"mema chedayata anuwa, warsayils hi dee ghaathanaya karanu laebuwe kawuda?","The correct answer is **C: kalahakaaree pirise samajikayek** (the social class of the revolutionary crowd).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where the ""kalahakaari pirise"" (revolutionary crowd) are actively causing disruption, forcing the king and queen to open the doors, and generally acting as a powerful force.** The passage states, ""Ek avasthaavakadi kalahakaari pirisehi saamaajikayek varsayilisidi mara damana lada raajakiya bhatayekuge hisa biyapat raejina idiriye waenuweya.""  This translates to: ""At one point, the social class of the revolutionary crowd, through deadly suppression, entered the king's presence with a part of the royal guard.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: welandapole kaanthawak (Versailles)** - While the event *takes place* at Versailles, the question asks what *caused* the events to unfold.  Versailles is the location, not the agent of change.
* **B: luwis XVI raju (Louis XVI King)** - The king is *affected* by the events, but doesn’t cause them. He's being pressured *by* the crowd.
* **D: aarak‍shakayek (a guard)** - The guards are present, but are overwhelmed and part of the chaos. They aren’t the driving force behind the events.



"
rajuta saha raejinata kalahakaaree pirisa wisin bala nokarana ladde pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: owunge karaththa kawulu wiwurtha kirima** (by opening their hands/revealing their cards).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kalahakari pirisa rajuta ha raejinata thama riya maediriye kavulu vivurta karaganna lesa bala kaleya."" This directly translates to ""The rebellious crowd strengthened by revealing the king and queen's secrets.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: warsayils wethin hadisi pitavimak** (being burdened by the inheritance of war) - The passage doesn't mention inheritance or being burdened.
* **C: aarak‍shakayaage hisa gasa daemeema naerabima** (not being able to lose a part of the protector's grass) - This is a nonsensical statement in the context of the passage.
* **D: paereesiyata aapasu gamanak** (going to Paris) - While the passage mentions a journey to Paris, it's not the *way* the crowd strengthened against the king and queen.

Therefore, option A accurately reflects how the crowd gained power – by exposing the secrets of the king and queen.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses Britain's naval blockade of Germany.** It states this led to Germany responding in kind, implementing unrestricted submarine warfare.  This is a direct counter-response, a ""similar war effort.""
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: me ha sambandha nowana naew anathurudayak thathwayaka thaebeema** (This became an excuse for new atrocities) - While atrocities *did* occur, the passage focuses on the *response* to the blockade, not using it as an excuse.
    * **C: jaathyanthara neethiyata wenaskam sidu kirima** (To achieve victory through international law) - The passage clearly describes a *violation* of international law (unrestricted submarine warfare), not achieving victory *through* it.
    * **D: theeranathmaka saepaym p‍rawesha wiya nohaeki vima** (It did not allow for definitive peace entry) - The passage doesn't discuss peace, but the escalation of warfare.

**Therefore, option A directly reflects the information provided in the passage about Germany's reaction to Britain's naval blockade.**



"

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ovunge seemaa rahitha sabmaerina yuddhayatada germaniya evaenima woo prathichaarayak apeksa kaleya."" This translates to ""...and Germany expected more from unrestricted submarine warfare.""  This directly links the British naval blockade to Germany's decision to engage in unrestricted submarine warfare.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eya jaath‍yanthara neethiyata patahaeni wiya** (It violated international law) - While the blockade *likely* violated international law, the passage doesn't focus on that aspect as the *reason* for Germany's response.
* **C: eya germaniye saepaym p‍ravahaya kadakappal kaleya** (It severely restricted Germany's supply flow) - This is a *result* of the blockade, not the reason Germany reacted.
* **D: apak‍shapathee naewwalata tharjanayak nowana bawa eya sahathika kaleya** (It helped to create a challenge for neutral ships) - This is a consequence of the situation, but not the primary driver of Germany's actions.

"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, bahu sklerosis roga winishchaya boho durata ida aeththe kaa sandahada?","Let's break down the passage and the question to determine the correct answer.

The passage describes a situation in America where around 400,000 people, particularly young and middle-aged adults, are affected by a neurological disease. It mentions MS (Multiple Sclerosis) and highlights that it affects the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves, impacting the central nervous system. It also states the disease can lead to various physical impairments.  The passage further says a prominent doctor was concerned about the increasing prevalence of this condition.

The question asks: ""Based on this text, how old were most people diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis?"" (translated from ""mema chedaya matha padanamwa, bahu sklerosis roga winishchaya boho durata ida aeththe kaa sandahada?"")

The passage *specifically* states the affected individuals are ""yauvana saha madyama vayasaeti vaedihitiyan athara"" – meaning ""young and middle-aged adults.""

Now let's analyze the options:

*   **A: 32 haewiridi kaanthawak** (32 year old adults) - This fits the ""young to middle-aged"" description.
*   **B: 15 haewiridi pirimiyek** (15 year old children) - Too young; the passage focuses on *adults*.
*   **C: 43 haewiridi pirimiyek** (43 year old children) - Incorrect wording and age is within the range. However, the wording is incorrect.
*   **D: 10 haewiridi kaanthawak** (10 year old adults) - Too young; the passage focuses on *adults*.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A: 32 haewiridi kaanthawak**. It directly aligns with the passage's description of the affected population being young and middle-aged adults.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, nithipatha kriyaakaarakam walata sahabhagee wana ayata vaedi sahayogayak awashya wanne kumak sandahada?","The correct answer is **A: wedanawa gaena rinathmaka awabodhaya (understanding pain through detachment)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses dealing with painful experiences (wedanawa), aversion (thunatiye wedanawen), and addictive tendencies.** It emphasizes a path *away* from being consumed by these feelings.  It mentions needing support to understand negative sensations and bodily reactions without getting overwhelmed.
* **The question (Q) asks what kind of support is needed for someone practicing mindful action.**  Someone practicing mindful action would need to understand their pain *without* being attached to it.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Thunatiya (Aversion):** The passage is about *overcoming* aversion, not needing support *for* it.
    * **C: Manasika awapeedanaya (Mental Distress):** While related, the passage is broader, encompassing physical sensations and addictive behaviors alongside mental distress.  Understanding is key, not just addressing distress.
    * **D: Biya (Fear):**  Fear is a component of aversion, but the passage is about the larger picture of dealing with all unpleasant experiences.

Therefore, **understanding pain through detachment (wedanawa gaena rinathmaka awabodhaya)** is the most fitting answer, aligning with the passage's focus on a mindful and non-reactive approach to suffering.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, kadu harambaya saaman‍yayen kreeda karanne keseda?","The correct answer is **D: dwandha swarupayen** (in a dual/competitive format).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** explicitly states: ""Kreedawa mulika washayen dvandha svarupayen kreeda karanu laebe, ek kadu silpiyeku thavat ayeku samaga dvandha satanata pivise.""  This translates to: ""The game will be played in a competitive manner, with one artist competing against another.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: navina swarupayen** (in a new format) - While the game might *be* new, the passage doesn't focus on the novelty of the format.
* **B: wishwa widyaala mattamen** (university teams only) - The passage mentions university students participating, but doesn't say it's *limited* to them.
* **C: olimpik mattamen** (Olympic teams only) - The passage mentions Olympic standards but doesn't mean it's only for Olympic teams.

Therefore, **dwandha swarupayen** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, pahatha sandahan dae atharin abhyanthara wisha vime p‍rabalathama saadhakaya wanuye kumakda?","The passage (P) describes internal poisoning and the importance of identifying the poison quickly. It mentions vomiting (vamanaya) as a common symptom, and emphasizes the need for careful testing and identification of the poison class. It also hints at the possibility of the poison being introduced through household chemicals or medicines.

The question (Q) asks: ""According to this text, what is considered the strongest tool for dealing with internal poisoning?""

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: okkaaraya ha una (vomiting and warmth)** - The passage *mentions* vomiting as a symptom, but doesn't position it as the *strongest tool* for dealing with the poisoning. Warmth isn't discussed.
* **B: wamanaya saha dahadiya daemeema (vomiting and burning sensation)** - Again, vomiting is a symptom, not a solution.  A burning sensation is not specifically mentioned as crucial for *dealing* with the poison.
* **C: daedi kaekkuma saha bade wedanawa (fear and severe pain)** - These are *results* of poisoning, not tools for addressing it.
* **D: niyama kala beheth pethi bothalayak (identifying the poison class quickly)** - This aligns perfectly with the passage’s emphasis on ""Nischita visha vargayata suvisesi prathaamadhara upades tibedayi labelaya pariksha karanna"" –  carefully testing and labeling to identify the specific poison class.  The passage stresses the *importance* of swift identification.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) emphasizes thoroughly examining the evidence (vinditaya) and understanding both what it *does* and *doesn't* show.** It stresses verifying claims with self-assessment and being cautious about things that seem helpful but might be harmful.  This points to a need for careful scrutiny.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: adala sthaanaya pareekshaa kara baeleema (do not examine the scene of the crime)** - This is the *opposite* of what the passage suggests.
* **B: windithayaata sameepa vima (get close to the evidence)** -  While proximity might be *part* of an investigation, the passage is about *interpreting* the evidence, not just being near it.
* **D: udaw balaporoththuwen sitinna (sit with helpers)** - Collaboration might be useful, but the core message is about *individual* thoroughness and critical thinking.



Therefore, **C** best reflects the passage's advice on how to approach evidence during an investigation."
windithayeku pareekshaa kirime kriyaawaliya niwaerediwa pilibimbu nokaranne pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashayangen kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: thamantama haaniyak siduvima pilibanda karadra nowanna** (avoiding any action that could cause harm).

Here's why:

* **The prompt (P) emphasizes safety and minimizing harm.** It states that if an action could cause harm, it should be avoided.  It's a directive for careful and responsible testing.
* **The question (Q) asks about what a tester should *avoid* when performing tests.**
* **Option A directly addresses this:** ""Avoiding actions that could cause harm"" aligns perfectly with the central message of the prompt.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: windithayaata pera sthaanaya pareekshaa karanna** (performing tests in place of the tester) -  This is irrelevant to the safety directive.
* **C: windithayaage thaththwaya pareekshaa karanna** (testing the tester's method) -  While method evaluation is important, it's not the primary focus of the provided text.
* **D: onaema anathurudayaka wiya haeki karunu kerehi awadhaanaya yomu karanna** (carefully observing and recording unexpected behavior) - This is a good practice in testing, but doesn't address the crucial point of *avoiding harm*.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer, reflecting the core principle outlined in the initial text."
p‍ransha wiplawaya wisin aethikarana lada wenaskam athurin kamkaru panthiye puravaesiyan kerehi saelakiya yuthu balapaemak aethi kala wenasa kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: rata wenuwen vaedi sahayogayak labaa gaeneema** (to gain support from various sections of the country).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Pransha viplavaya wenath ratawala mardanaya karana lada kamkaru panthiye boho denekuta thamangema viplavayan aarambha kirimata da hetu viya.""  This translates to: ""The French Revolution, facing suppression within the country, became a reason for many working-class parties to begin their revolution.""  Essentially, the French Revolution inspired similar movements because of its struggle *within* the country.
* **The question (Q) asks:**  What was the reason working-class parties previously suppressed, used the French Revolution as a basis to gain...?
* **Option A** directly addresses this. The French Revolution showed that change was possible and could garner broad *national support* (""rata wenuwen vaedi sahayogayak labaa gaeneema"").  This support was crucial for those previously suppressed groups to begin their own revolutions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: panthiyata nowa nipunathawayata awadhaanaya yomu kirima** (paying attention to parties or skills) - While relevant to political movements, it doesn’t explain *why* the French Revolution was used as a basis for others.
* **C: ripablikan mathavadaya sammatha kirima** (agreeing with republican ideology) - The passage doesn't focus on specific ideologies like republicanism. It focuses on the *action* of revolution.
* **D: nawa minum paddhathiyak** (a new voting system) - Voting systems are not the central theme discussed in the passage.



Therefore, **A** is the most logical and accurate answer based on the information provided in the text."
"p‍ransha wiplawayen pasuwa, hamuda saha wenath wurtheenhi saarthakathwaya aduwen padanam vimata ida aeththe kumak mathada?","The correct answer is **B: panthiya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pransha viplavaya wenath ratawala mardanaya karana lada kamkaru panthiye boho denekuta thamangema viplavayan aarambha kirimata da hetu viya.""  This translates to: ""Many working-class people, suffering oppression in the country due to the French Revolution, were motivated to start their own revolution.""

The question asks what *kind* of mathada (group/sect/class) is being referred to in connection with being driven to revolution by the French Revolution and suffering oppression. The passage explicitly identifies them as ""panthiye"" - working class/sectarian groups.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: saadhanaya (means/tools/resources)** - This doesn't fit the context of a group of people.
*   **C: abhilashaya (desire/wish)** - This refers to a feeling, not a group.
*   **D: wargaya (class/caste)** - While related, ""panthiya"" in this context is more specifically about working-class groups and their specific struggles, rather than broader social classes.

The text (P) discusses traffic flow, congestion, and potential issues arising from changes in traffic patterns. Let's analyze how each answer option relates to this:

* **A: jalaye gunathmakabhawaya (water quality)** - This is irrelevant to road satisfaction.
* **B: palam idikirima (bridge collapses)** - While bridge collapses would *certainly* cause dissatisfaction, the text doesn't mention this. It focuses on traffic flow changes.
* **C: podu p‍ravahanaya (general traffic/congestion)** - This directly addresses the issue. The text (P) says changes to traffic flow (""pravaahana krama"") can cause problems, leading to dissatisfaction.  The phrase ""Sanvardhitha ratawala...codanaa itha kalaaturakin asannata laebe"" (improved roads...cause inconvenience during a certain period) points to congestion as a likely cause of dissatisfaction.
* **D: adhyaapanaya (teaching)** - Completely irrelevant.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: podu p‍ravahanaya (general traffic/congestion)**.  The text implies that changes to roads, intended to improve things, can temporarily *increase* congestion and cause public dissatisfaction.

"mema chedayata anuwa, podu p‍ravahana paddhathi pilibandawa kumak kiwa haekida?","The question (Q) asks about what is said regarding improving the traffic flow system. The passage (P) discusses how a smart system impacts traffic flow, requests for flow information, and potential drawbacks if requests are ignored. Let's break down the options:

* **A: ewa bhawitha karana saema kenekutama owun hondin aadaraya karai (This smart system is based on several important foundations)** - While the passage *implies* the system is built on something solid, it doesn't explicitly state this. It focuses on *how* it operates, not *why* it's built.

* **B: ewa jalaye gunathmakabhawaya tharam naraka naetha (This doesn't reach the level of improving water quality)** - This is completely irrelevant to the topic of traffic flow.

* **C: ewa bhawitha karana pudgalayingen boho paeminili aethi weyi (Many individuals benefit from this smart system)** - The passage states it contributes to societal participation, so people *do* benefit.  This aligns with the overall theme.

* **D: boho sanvardhitha ratawala ewa nomile laebe (Many developed countries won't accept this)** - The passage doesn't mention acceptance or rejection by developed countries.  It discusses potential problems with *ignoring* the system's requests, not a global refusal.

Therefore, the best answer is **C**. The passage indicates the system has a positive impact by enhancing societal participation – a clear benefit to individuals.



**Final Answer: C**"
"mema chedayata anuwa, riyadurange anapek‍shitha bawa nisa maeneemata apahasu wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: gamanagamana p‍rawegaya (Traffic speed)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses studying traffic flow, density, and *speed* (pravegaya) as key characteristics for better traffic planning.  It states that unexpected slowdowns (apekshitha bawa nisa maeneemata apahasu wanne) are related to these factors.  Of the options given, speed is the most directly linked to sudden changes in traffic conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: marga saelasumkaranaya (Road construction):** While road construction impacts traffic, it's not an *unexpected* slowdown in the same way speed fluctuations are. Construction is often planned and communicated.
* **C: marga meheyum (Road shape):** Road shape contributes to consistent traffic patterns, not sudden unexpected slowdowns.
* **D: gamanagamana p‍rawahaya (Traffic flow):** While related to speed, *flow* is a broader concept.  A sudden slowdown is specifically about the rate of movement – the speed – decreasing unexpectedly.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...rathavaahana pravaahayan yam saadhaarana anukulataavak aethi athara dhala washayen ganithamaya washayen nirupanaya kala haekiya.""  This translates to ""...how traffic flow can be generally represented mathematically.""  Then it specifically lists three key characteristics for this representation: flow, density, and speed.
* **The question asks:** ""...what is used to mathematically represent traffic flow?"" 
* **Density (gamanagamana ghanathwaya)** is *one* of the key mathematical components of representing traffic flow as explicitly mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: marga meheyum (road surface):** While road surface is important for traffic, it's not a *mathematical representation* of flow.
* **B: riyaduru haesireema (driver behavior):** Driver behavior influences flow, but isn't the mathematical representation itself.
* **C: marga saelaesma (road construction):**  Road construction affects flow, but it isn't a mathematical variable used to *describe* the flow.



"
hershe saha ches owunge DNA baddha kirimata bhawitha kale kumakda? ,"The correct answer is **D: wairasa** (virus).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Harshe saha ches ovungema DNA, bacteriavakata **baddha kirimata ropanaya ho vairasa bhavitha kalaha.**""  This translates to: ""The DNA of Hershey and Chase was introduced into bacteria *either by attaching it to a virus* or being infected by a virus.""

Therefore, the passage directly identifies the virus as the method by which their DNA entered the bacteria.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: wikiranasheelee posparas (radioactive phosphorus)** -  Radioactive phosphorus was *used to label the DNA*, but it wasn't the mechanism of entry into the bacteria.
*   **B: jaanamaya drawya (genetic material)** -  This is too general. While DNA *is* genetic material, the question asks *how* it entered the bacteria.
*   **C: wikiranasheelee salfar (radioactive sulfur)** - Radioactive sulfur was used to label the *protein* coat, not the DNA.

wikurthi kirim walata daruwan wetha gena yaamata aethi haekiyaawa randa pawathinne kumak matha da?,"The correct answer is **B: jaanamaya drawyawala vaedgathkama**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** states: ""...balapaem lada jaanamaya drawya kotase vaedagathkama saha balapaem lada sailaya janmaanu pata sailayakda yanna matha vividha pratiphala labaa diya haekiya.""  This translates to ""...strong children, knowledgeable and skilled people, and strong children being born and going on paths, receive various rewards.""  The passage links *daruwan wetha gena yaamata* (receiving knowledge/wisdom) to the benefits of being born strong and progressing in life.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sailaya wishabeeja walata mul we nam** -  This refers to the root of a seed/birth, not directly to receiving knowledge.
* **C: wikurthi kirim wargaya** - This is about the class/category of those with disabilities, not about receiving knowledge.
* **D: wikurthiya saila maranayata hethu wiya haeki nam** - This refers to disabilities leading to death, which is a negative consequence, not the benefit of wisdom.

**Q (the question)** asks what someone receives when they get knowledge. The passage explicitly links knowledge (""jaanamaya drawya"") to benefits and rewards.



"
"mema chedaye dakva aethi thorathuru matha padanamwa, wikurthi vimwala wiwidha balapaem randa nopawathinne kumak matha da?","The correct answer is **C: balapaemata lak wu jaanamaya drawyawala vaedgathkama** (those associated with knowledge and skills).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** discusses how distorted or improper actions (vikurti) lead to negative consequences (suffering, death) and how proper actions yield positive results.  It specifically highlights that these results are linked to *jaanamaya drawya* (knowledge and skills) and *vaedagathkama* (wisdom/understanding) which lead to beneficial outcomes.  The passage contrasts this with actions stemming from *vikurti vargaya* (distorted behaviors).

* **Q (the question)** asks what kind of benefits are *not* linked to distorted behaviors.

* **A, B, and D** all relate to negative aspects or the source of the distortion itself (possessions, seeds of desire, distorted behaviors).  They would *be* linked to the distorted behaviors.

* **C** directly connects to the positive outcome described in P – benefits coming from knowledge and wisdom – and thus would *not* be a result of distorted actions.



Therefore, the passage suggests that benefits arising from knowledge and skills are distinct from those resulting from improper conduct."
aithihasika sanskrutheen thula eluwan aethi daedi kirimata hethuwa nowuye pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **D: ewa kiri sandaha wu p‍raweshaya wiya** (It is because it is a place where milk flows in historical culture).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Aitihasika sanskurti saha gothra kiri, lom, mas, saha sama labaa gaeneeme pahasu kramayak lesa movun thabaaa gaeneema aerambuha.""  This translates to ""It began with a series of migrations following historical culture and clans, obtaining milk, wealth, fish, and honor.""  The abundance of milk (kiri) is directly linked to the reasons for the migrations and settlement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ewa mas sandaha wu p‍raweshaya wiya** (It is because it is a place where fish flow in historical culture) - While fish (mas) are mentioned, milk is more central to the passage's explanation.
* **B: ewa idam thruna bhoomi bawata path kirimata udaw wiya** (It is helpful to send milk to the land of grass) - This doesn't relate to the historical reason for settling.
* **C: ewa yam mith‍rathwayak labaa deyi** (It is because it obtains some friendships) -  Friendship isn't mentioned as a driving factor in the passage.



"
golf kreedawe gatha yuthu aduma ilakkaya kumak sandaha weda?,"The correct answer is **B: paharawal**.

Here's why:

The passage describes golf as a game where players try to hit a ball into a hole with as few strokes as possible.  It mentions calculating the *number of strokes* (""aduma prahara pramanayak"") to determine the winner.  ""Paharawal"" (strokes) directly relates to this calculation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: pandu** - This means ""ball"" - while important to golf, it's not what the passage focuses on when discussing determining a winner.
*   **C: vaara** - This means ""hole"" - again, important, but not the metric for victory.
*   **D: walawal** - This means ""ground"" or ""field"" - too general.



"
"golf pitiyaka, thanakola keti lesa kapa aeththe kothaenada?","The correct answer is **B: green p‍radeshaya thula** (on the green area).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...sidura vata wana thanakola keti vannata kapanu laeba green yanuven haedunvayi."" This translates to ""...the ball goes into the hole by rolling on the green."" 
* This directly implies that the hole (keti) is located on the green area (green pradeshaya).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: daha atawana sidura asala** (being on the teeing ground) - The passage mentions the teeing ground as the *start* of the hole, not where the hole itself is.
* **C: palamu sidura asala** (being on the first tee) - Similar to A, this is the starting point.
* **D: pitiye palamu bhagaye dee** (in the first part of the hole) - While technically true, it's not specific enough. The hole is specifically *on* the green.



"
athhada baeleeme saaman‍ya aramuna wanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: wibhawya upakalpanayak ho kihipayak baehaera kirima (to behave like a fabricated one or something imaginary)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) describes a scientific method that *doesn't* rely on baseless assumptions, beliefs, or fabricated ideas. It explicitly contrasts this method with things that *are* based on speculation (""upakalpitha ekak"").  The question (Q) asks what a typical, non-scientific mindset would be like. 

Therefore, acting like a fabrication or holding onto imaginary beliefs (option A) best reflects the opposite of the described scientific approach.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: lokaya kriyaa karana aakaaraya therum gaeneemata (understanding how the world works)** - While important, this isn't necessarily a *flaw* of a non-scientific mindset, just not a systematic way to understand it.
*   **C: prashna idiripath kirimata (asking questions)** - Asking questions is part of *both* scientific and non-scientific thinking.
*   **D: widyaathmaka paryeshana sandaha maga penvimata (following a scientific research path)** - This directly describes the *scientific* method, not a typical/non-scientific mindset.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, widyaathmaka paryeshana sandaha maga penvimata upakaaree nowanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: wiya haeki upakalpana baehaera kirimata** (developing hypothetical concepts).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""...athhada baeleemak yanu viya haeki upakalpitha ekak ho waedi gananak ivath kirimata bhavitha karana pariksanayaki, prashna aseema saha niriksanaya kireema da vidyatmaka kramayata margopadesaya sapayayi.""  This directly translates to ""...and examinations developed to create calculated methods of hypothetical concepts, questions, and observations also provide guidance to the scientific method.""

* **The question (Q) asks:**  What is *not* helpful in following the scientific research path?

* Options A, B, and D are all mentioned as helpful components of the scientific method *within the passage*.  Option C, developing hypothetical concepts, is presented *as part of the method itself* - something you *do* to follow the research path.

Therefore, the question is asking which option *isn't* a part of the scientific method as described in the passage, and the answer is **C**.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, tonedo pilibanda vaeradi p‍rakaashaya wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **D: samahara tonedo walata paeyata saethapum 300k pamana sulangak thibiya haekiya** (Some tornadoes have a funnel width of 300k (133 feet) and a debris cloud width of 480 feet).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Mema ruduru kunatu, paeyata ki.mee. 480 (thatparayata meetara 133; paeyata saethapum 300) k dakva wana sulang sahitha wei."" which directly translates to ""These storms, with funnels up to 480 feet (133 yards; a width of 300 feet) are seen with debris clouds.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: tonedo hata awata aethi saema deyakma winasha kirimata haekiyaawa aetha** (Tornadoes can destroy anything in their path) - While true generally, this isn't a specific detail from the passage.
* **B: tonedo anekuth suli kunatu walata wada kuda pradeshawalata pahara deyi** (Tornadoes cause damage to forests and areas) - Again, generally true but not a *specific* detail mentioned in the text.
* **C: tonedo walin bahutharayak paeya thunakata wada pawathee** (Tornadoes travel with a lot of wind) - This is implied, but the passage focuses on the size of the funnel and debris cloud.



"
"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, tonedo wala bahutharayak niwaerediwa wisthara karanne pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashayangen kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: ewa anekuth kunatu walata wada wishala p‍radeshawalata balapayi** (It affects a large area from where it originates).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a tornado as impacting a wide area (""pradeshayakata wana namuth, evata siya margaye aethi siyalla vinasha kala haeki ya"" - affecting a region, destroying everything in its path).**  It also mentions its size (480km wide).
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **A: ewa saaman‍yayen paeya thunakata wada pawathee** (It generally moves towards the feet) - This is nonsensical and doesn't relate to the passage.
    * **B: ewa paeyata saethapum 480k pamana wegayen yuthu sulan nipadwayi** (It produces a funnel cloud 480k wide) - While the passage mentions 480k, it refers to the *width of the affected area*, not necessarily the funnel cloud itself.
    * **D: ewata gas mulinudura daemeemata haekiya** (It is caused by gas accumulation) - The passage mentions gas, but doesn't say it *causes* the tornado.

Therefore, option C best summarizes the passage's description of the tornado's broad destructive reach.



"
16 wana siyawasedee minisun kirimata patan gaththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: kaacha bhawitha kirima** (future forecasting).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Visaalanaya sandaha minisun visin kaacha saedeema saha bhavitha kireema avurudu dasa dahas gananak thisse siduvannaki.""  This translates to ""The large survey suggests that people are increasingly interested in accurate predictions and future forecasting for the next ten thousand years.""
* **The question (Q) asks:** What is the focus of the survey regarding the fall of 16-year-olds?
* **The passage links the 16-year-old demographic to the desire for future predictions.** The passage mentions a difficult future and how forecasting can help deal with it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: wasthu wishalanaya kirima** (object analysis) - The passage doesn't focus on analyzing objects.
* **C: kaacha saedeema** (accurate predictions) - This is *part* of what people want, but ""future forecasting"" (bhavitha kireema) is the broader, overarching focus.
* **D: duradkna nipadavima** (difficult future) - This is the *problem* being addressed, not the focus of the survey itself.



"
kaacha bhawithakaramin minisun kopamana kaalayak wasthun wishalanaya kara thibeda?,"The correct answer is **A: awurudu dhasak thisse** (over ten years).

Here's why:

The passage states the vision concerns people who will live to see ""bhavitha kireema avurudu dasa dahas gananak thisse"" - meaning ""over ten years of blessed/futuristic centuries"".  The question asks *how long* the visionaries will live.  The phrase directly answers this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 16 wana siyawase aga bhagaye sita** - This refers to a part of Europe 16 years after a certain event, not a lifespan.
* **C: awurudu dahas gananak thisse** - While related, it’s not the specific duration the visionaries live *to see*. ""Dasa dahas"" means over ten thousand, and is more about the future timeframe, not individual lifespan.
* **D: 16 wana siyawase mul bhagaye sita** - Similar to B, refers to a location and timeframe, not lifespan.

"mema chedayata anuwa, muhammad thumage lena ethumage aadhyaathmika piliweth ho saradharma pilibandawa pawasanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: ohu samaya ha hudekalawa agayakarai (He foreshadows time and existence)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Muhammad as existing *before* time and space (""lokaye anek kotasin sampurnayen ma hudekalaava pawathee"" - existing before billions of years of existence).**  He's depicted as a light (""noor"") and a diamond (""hiraa"") predating creation.
* **The text suggests he's the source of spiritual knowledge (""tumage aadhyaatmika naburuthaa pilibanda itha paehaedili chitrayak labaa dei"" - gives a picture of your spiritual future).** This points to a being who isn't *within* time, but *knows* time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pitatha shabdaya menehi kirimata upakaaree we (He benefited from the words of his father)** - The passage doesn't mention a father or any benefit received from someone else's words.
* **C: ohuta itha sulu hudekala kaalayak awashya wiya (He necessarily had a short period of existence)** - The opposite is true; the passage claims he existed *before* time.
* **D: kawurun ho ohu daekeema ha aeseema pilibandawa saelakilimath wiya (He was curious about what he saw and didn't see)** - The passage doesn't portray Muhammad as curious. He *is* the source of light and understanding, not someone seeking it.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, yakada mulinma bhawitha kale kumak sandahada?","The correct answer is **D: rel peeli**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""1767 dee palamu purna yakada rail peeli handunvaa dene ladi"" which translates to ""In 1767, the first complete railway was opened.""  The question asks about what the railways were built with/inspired by.  ""Rel peeli"" (railway) is the direct answer found in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: rel peeli haras kanu** - While relating to railways, it mentions ""seeing"" the railways, not the foundational element.
*   **B: vaegan maarga** -  ""Vaegan maarga"" means ""speedy path"" and while related to the *purpose* of railways, it’s not what they are *made* of.
*   **C: roda** - ""Roda"" means ""wheel"" – wheels are *part* of a railway, but the railway itself is more than just wheels.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, lee roda wenuwata yakada roda aadesha karanu laebuwe aeyi?","The correct answer is **D: rel peeli matha wu yakadawalin ewata haani vi thibuni**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""1767 dee palamu purna yakada rail peeli handunvaa dene ladi."" (The first complete stone rail was laid in 1767.)
* **The question asks:** What followed the laying of the stone rail?
* **Option D** directly relates to this, stating that damage occurred to the stones *after* the rail was laid.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ashwayange wegaya vaedi kirimata** (to speed up horse-drawn carriages) - While the passage mentions carriages, it doesn't say this was a consequence of the rail.
* **B: ewa wadath kaaryak‍shama lesa salakanu laebeeya** (to make the path more efficient) -  The passage mentions efficiency, but doesn't link it directly to what *followed* laying the rail.
* **C: wishala barak haesiravimata ewata haeki wiya** (to make a large enclosure for it) - This refers to the initial construction, not what happened afterwards.



Therefore, **D** is the most logical and directly supported answer based on the text."
"mema chedayata anuwa, romaentikavada kaala parichchedayedee pudgalayan haedagasva aeththe kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: bhoogola widyaawa (geography)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""Romantikavadaye sandarbhaya thula, bhoogola vidyava pudgalayan haedagaesvu athara..."" This translates to: ""In the context of Romanticism, individuals were inspired by geography...""  

The question (Q) asks what inspired individuals during the Romantic period. The passage directly identifies geography as one of those inspirations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: neethi (ethics/morality):** While Romanticism touched upon ethical themes, the passage doesn't emphasize it as a primary source of inspiration.
* **C: sirith wirith (history/tradition):** The passage mentions traditions being part of culture, but it doesn't state that history itself was the main inspiration.
* **D: sanskruthiya (culture):** Culture is a broad term. The passage specifies *how* culture was inspired – through geography, customs, and legends.  Geography is the more direct answer.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...thaakshanaya magin samaajiyava thattvaaropita samaajayanta vada naisargika samaajayan kerehi """"balapaem"""" aetikarana bavayi.""  This translates to ""Temporality, through its influence, creates 'power' both in socially constructed societies and in naturally occurring societies.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: samajayata thaakshanaye balapaema samajiya washayen thathvaropitha kara aetha:** (Temporality's power in society is socially constructed) - While the passage *mentions* socially constructed societies, it also includes naturally occurring societies, making this too narrow.
* **B: thaakshanaye diyunuwa sanskruthiyata balapanne naetha:** (Temporality's influence does not empower culture) - The passage actually suggests temporality *does* influence culture and governance (""thaakshanika diyunuva sanskruthika ha deshapalanika balapamen"").
* **D: thaak‍shanika sanwardhanaya deshapalana balapaem matha padanam nowe:** (Temporary development does not relate to governance power) - The passage links temporality to both cultural and political power.



Therefore, **C** most accurately reflects the core idea about temporality and power as presented in the passage."
"mema chedayata anuwa, pahatha sandahan karunu walin dunna aedeema ha sambandha nowana karuna kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: shakthimath shabdayak** (powerful sounds).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ihala dunu waadanayak saamanyayen mrudu shabdayak jananaya karana athara, pahala dunu wadanayak vada **saktimat saha niscita we**.""  This translates to ""The sound of the first drum generally produces soft sounds, while the sound of the second drum is **more powerful and definite**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: wada mrudu shabdayak** (soft sounds) - This describes the *first* drum, not what the question asks about the second.
*   **B: stepalayak men penena salakunak** (the sounds of the drums present in layers) - While the passage mentions layers, it doesn't directly answer the question about the *characteristic* of the second drum.
*   **D: dunne hasuruwen aarambha we** (starts with hitting) - This refers to *how* the drums are played, not the sound they make.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, mrudu shabdayakata sambandha wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: pahala dunna salakunak** (the first mentioned ones).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ihalata yannen adahas karanne oba dunna ihala kelavarin aarambha kara dunne thallu kala yuthu bhava wana athara pahalata yannen adahas karanne oba dunne pahala kelavarin aarambha kara... Ihala dunu waadanayak saamanyayen **mrudu shabdayak** jananaya karana athara, pahala dunu wadanayak vada saktimat saha niscita we.""

This translates to: ""...and the first mentioned ones, when you focus on the beginning of what you did... The sound of the first ones is generally a **soft sound**...""

Therefore, the passage directly links *pahala dunna salakunak* (the first mentioned ones) to *mrudu shabdayakata* (soft sounds).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: dunna aedeema** - This refers to the ""added"" ones and isn't connected to soft sounds.
*   **C: V wage penena salakunak** - This refers to other types of ones and isn't specifically linked to softness.
*   **D: oba athin dunna allagena sitina sthaanayen aarambha karanna** -  This describes a starting point, not a sound quality.



"
ath awasanaye mulika washayen kumak sandaha bhawitha kirimata anuwarthanaya vi aethi bawa fosila walin pennum karanne pahatha ewayin kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: sancharanaya (movement/circulation)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) focuses heavily on movement and travel.** It describes how primates moved, their walking style, the distance they travelled, and the fossil evidence of their movement over millions of years.  Phrases like ""samcaranaya"" (circulation/movement), ""athin gaman kirima"" (walking on four legs), and descriptions of foot structure all relate to how these creatures *moved*.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: haesiravima (existence/being):** While the passage implies existence, it's not the *central* topic. The focus is on *how* they existed – through movement.
* **B: bara dara gaeneema (number of offspring):** This is a very minor detail mentioned only briefly.
* **D: athin gaman kirima (walking on four legs):** This is *a type* of movement, but ""sancharanaya"" is a broader, more encompassing term that covers all forms of movement discussed in the passage.

**The question (Q) asks about the fundamental aspect of their existence revealed by fossils.** Fossils primarily reveal how things moved and behaved, and in this case, the passage concentrates on the *movement* of early primates.

Here's why:

* **P's text** describes chimpanzees walking in a similar way to humans – on four limbs. It then mentions a comparison of ""ath"" (limbs) and ""pada"" (feet) with humans and measuring their size. This directly relates to using arm and foot size as a way to understand chimpanzee locomotion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ewa minisunge ewata wada kelin we** (it was said by humans) - The text doesn't focus on *who* said something, but *what* is being observed.
* **C: ewa bara dara gaeneema sandaha bhawitha we** (it is excited about many future possibilities) - This is a misinterpretation of the text.  There's no indication of excitement or future possibilities.
* **D: ewa p‍radhaana washayen haesiravima sandaha yoda gaene** (it is mainly about describing a warrior) - The text isn't about warriors. It's about chimpanzee and human locomotion and size comparison.



"
kumana sanchithaya thora gaeneemen nawa jaana wichal‍yathawaya iwath weda?,"The correct answer is **B: pratisamyojana kirima**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) describes a process of creating a new public opinion. It states that a new public opinion is formed ""atara, varanaya prakashitha vicalyatha samcitayen eya ivath karayi"" (by accumulating published opinions). Then it details how this accumulated data is processed: ""Ek ek paramparava samaga samcita deka athara idiriyata saha pasupasata visamgamana ha **pratisamyojana kavalam weeme vicalanaya venas we.**"" (It goes through a process of separation, comparison, and **recombination** with each tradition).

Therefore, **recombination (pratisamyojana)** is the process that actively *uses* the accumulated data to form the new public opinion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: saegawunu (collection):** Collection is the initial step, not the process *within* the accumulated data.
*   **C: visamgamana (separation):** Separation is *part* of the process, but not the core mechanism for forming the new opinion.
*   **D: prakashitha (published):** Published opinions are the source material, not the process of forming the new opinion.

Therefore, **B** is the best answer.



"
jana wichal‍yathawa ek kirima sandaha wagakiwa yuththe kumana kriyaawaliyada?,"The correct answer is **B: pratisamyojana kirima** (recombination/re-sorting).

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

* **The text describes a process of creating *new* public opinion (jana vicalyathavayak).** It mentions taking existing opinions, *re-sorting* (pratisamyojana) them, and combining them with insights (idiriyaata saha pasupasata visamgamana) to create something novel.
* **Visamgamana (divergence) and Wikurthiya (distortion) are parts of the process, but not the core action of creating a *new* opinion.** They happen *along with* recombination.
* **Prakashitha (publishing) is the *result* of the process,** not the action that creates the new opinion.

Therefore, **pratisamyojana kirima (recombination/re-sorting)** is the key activity described in the text as being central to forming new public opinion.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...tibune cola varga saha **ranila bijawala** pawathina protina wana namudu..."" This directly translates to ""...types of legumes and **oil seeds** containing protein...""  The passage then goes on to discuss how a lack of protein leads to various health problems and compares humans to chimpanzees who eat a ""protein gaitaluwa"" (protein-rich diet). Therefore, oil seeds are identified as a source of protein within the context of this comparison.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: miya giya kola** (gotu kola) - The passage does not mention gotu kola.
*   **C: thanakola peththan** (king coconut kernel) -  The passage doesn't mention king coconut.
*   **D: mal natuwa** (flower bud) - The passage doesn't mention flower buds.

"mema chedayata anuwa, ath‍yawashya aemaino amla nomaethikama nisa aethi nowana pahatha sandahan gaetalu walin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: aahara jirna gaetalu (digestive issues/problems with food digestion)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that a lack of essential amino acids leads to *“dushkara ya. Thavada, ese kirimata nohaeki weemen thadabala prativipaka aethi we: vardhana athathiya, manda poshanaya, saha avasan washayen maranaya.""* which translates to difficulty in digestion and subsequently leads to growth issues, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.  The passage focuses on the *initial* consequence of lacking essential amino acids - the difficulty in digesting food properly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: mandposhanaya (malnutrition):** This is a *result* of the digestive issues, not the immediate problem caused by the lack of amino acids.
* **C: wardhana aathathiya (growth issues):**  Also a *result* of the primary digestive problem.
* **D: maranaya (death):** This is the ultimate consequence, far down the line from the initial problem.



Therefore, the most direct answer to the question about what happens when essential amino acids are lacking is the problem with food digestion itself."

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""Upa sanskruthiwala saamaajikayan boho vita siya samaajikatvayata mosthara, charithrare saha upabhasha harahaa vishesha saha **sanketamaya akarayen sangna labaa dethi**.""  This translates to: ""Subcultures often convey social meanings strongly, especially through history, sub-languages, and **symbolic forms**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ekaabaddha kirimata uthsaha kirimen** (engaging in a fixed practice with enthusiasm) - While subcultures *may* have practices, the passage doesn't focus on practice itself but on *how* meaning is communicated.
* **B: owun wata sitina saema kenekugema wishvasayan piligaeneemen** (believing in something seen in one's upbringing) - This refers to personal belief, not how a subculture communicates *to* others.
* **C: samaja sammathayan piligaeneemen** (believing in social acceptance) - This is about conforming, which isn't the primary focus of subcultures, who often differentiate themselves from mainstream society.



Therefore, option D accurately reflects the key point made in the passage regarding how subcultures connect with and communicate with the wider society - through stylistic and symbolic representation."
"mema chedaye idiripath kara aethi siddhaanthayata anuwa, tharjanathmaka haesireem walata sambandha vima nisa ekaakruthika lesa salakunu karana lada janavargika sulutharayak samaga handunana daruwekuta kumak siduwiya haekida?","The question (Q) asks about what a child should do according to the provided premise (P), which discusses avoiding forming prejudices (racial and class-based) and instead engaging with people of different backgrounds.  The premise suggests a child shouldn't avoid a potential friend (a class-based ""artisan"") just because their parents might disapprove due to their social class.

Let's break down the options:

* **A: daruva tharjanathmaka haesireemen vaelakee siteemata uthsaha karanu aetha (The child should strive to reach the limits of imaginative desires.)** - This is irrelevant to the situation. While imagination is good, it doesn't address the issue of prejudice and interacting with people from different backgrounds.
* **B: daruva tharjanathmaka haesireemata sambandha vimata vaedi idak aetha (The child should distance themselves from relationships connected to imaginative desires.)** - This is the *opposite* of what the premise suggests. It's about *avoiding* relationships, reinforcing prejudice.
* **C: samaja thathwayan wethin daruva iwath wanu aetha (The child should go as the social norms dictate.)** - This is also not a good answer. The premise implies *challenging* societal norms that lead to prejudice, not blindly following them.
* **D: daruva wenath vargika sulutharayan samaga katayuthu kirima p‍rathik‍shepa karanu aetha (The child should reject engaging with class-based artisans.)** - This is directly against the premise. The entire point is to *not* reject people based on their class.

Therefore, none of the provided options accurately reflect the advice implied by the premise. However, if I *had* to choose the *least incorrect* option, it would be **A**, though it's still a poor fit.  The underlying intent of the passage is encouraging openness and defying preconceived notions, which *could* be interpreted as expanding the limits of one's world/desires. But it's a weak connection.

**It's very likely the question or answer choices are flawed.**  A better answer would be something like: ""The child should continue to build a friendship with the artisan despite potential parental disapproval.""

"mema chedayata anuwa, vargika ekaakruthi pilibanda daruwekuge daenuma balapaemak aethi kala haekke pahatha sandahan karunu walin kumana karunatada?","The correct answer is **B: owunge haesireema (their desires)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) focuses on how a person's desires and the fulfillment (or lack thereof) of those desires drive their need for social and class consolidation (ekaakruthi).**  It specifically mentions someone seeking association with a higher-class individual to potentially fulfill unmet desires (like good rewards/recognition).  The passage emphasizes that unmet desires *lead* to the search for social and class connection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: owun handuna gaeneemata thora ganna vargika sulutharaya (the class artisan who tries to get something from the one they associate with):** This describes *who* is doing the seeking, not the *driving force* behind it.
* **C: anek daruwan samaga owunge sambandhathawaya (their relationships with many children):** This is irrelevant to the passage's focus.
* **D: jathiya pilibanda owunge artha daekvima (their understanding of nationality):** While nationality is mentioned, it's not the primary motivator described. The core is about personal *desire*.

**Therefore, the question asks what fuels the desire for class consolidation, and the answer is the individual's desires (haesireema) as highlighted in the passage.**



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, p‍rachanda daruwange wardhanayata anurupa wiya nohaeki wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: thaniwama jiwath vima** (living in isolation).

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

The text describes ""prachanda daruwan"" (powerful intoxicants) leading to isolation: ""samaharu thanivama wanaye jivath woo bhava pawase"" which translates to ""people live/exist in isolation.""  The passage links the powerful intoxicants to a withdrawal from society and a solitary existence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: shakthimath sanvada kusalatha (skillful powerful communication):** The text doesn't mention improved communication. In fact, it implies the opposite – a break *from* communication and society.
* **C: hudekala vime prawanathawa (tendency towards violence):** While the text describes a strong impact, it doesn't specifically state a tendency towards violence.  It speaks more to mental distress and a disconnect from reality.
* **D: samaja kanassalla (social unrest):** While the withdrawal *could* contribute to societal issues, the primary effect described is individual isolation, not widespread unrest.



Therefore, **A** most accurately reflects the consequence of ""prachanda daruwan"" described in the text."
"mema chedayata anuwa, pahatha sandahan karunu walin lamun thula p‍rachanda haesireema niwaerediwa wisthara karanne kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: demapiyan wisin kotu karana lada daruwan thula pamanak p‍rachanda haesireema bahulawa daknata laebe** (roughly translates to: ""The intense feeling/experience is largely influenced by the extent to which one engages in harmful substances within their mental state"").

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the connection between harmful substances (daruwan - alcohol/drugs) and the intensification of negative experiences (""prachanda"" - intense/severe).** It details how these substances weaken the mind, leading to a more amplified and destructive emotional response. The text highlights that the intensity is *directly related* to how much someone indulges in these substances while grappling with mental distress.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: shaareerika durwalathawayak nisa bahutharayak p‍rachanda haesireem aethi we** (roughly: ""physical weakness causes a lot of intense feelings""): While physical weakness might contribute, the passage *specifically* emphasizes the role of harmful substances on a weakened *mind*.
* **B: p‍rachanda haesireema adu samajagatha vimen aethiwiya haekiya** (roughly: ""intense feelings are a result of societal factors""):  The passage doesn't deny societal influences, but it centers on the internal impact of substance use.
* **D: siyaluma p‍rachanda haesireem darunu buddhimaya aabadha nisa aethi we** (roughly: ""all intense feelings are caused by a blocked/disturbed mind""): The passage focuses on *intensified* negative feelings *through* substance use when the mind is already vulnerable, not all intense feelings in general.



Therefore, option C best reflects the core argument presented in the provided text."
"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, yaepum krushikarmayata anukula nowanne pahatha sandahan piliweth atharin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: gowiyaage pawule awashyatha sapuralana asvaennak kerehi awadhaanaya yomu kirima** (paying attention to fulfilling the needs of the farmer).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) emphasizes the importance of understanding the farmer's needs (gowiyaage pawule awashyatha) to ensure sustainable and effective agriculture.**  It states that successful agriculture depends on adequately meeting the farmer’s requirements.
* **Question (Q) asks about factors favorable to agriculture.**  Meeting the farmer's needs *is* a fundamental factor.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: an ayata wikineema sandaha aahara nishpadanaya kirima** (selling food produced according to demand) - While important for economics, it doesn’t directly relate to *making* agriculture favorable.
* **C: diyunu thaak‍shanika k‍rama walata wada ihala asvaennak labaa gaeneema kerehi awadhaanaya yomu kirima** (paying attention to obtaining high yields through quick methods) - The passage implicitly *rejects* quick/easy methods, advocating for a more balanced and environmentally friendly approach.
* **D: gowiyaage p‍radeshayata desheeya beeja labaa gaeneema** (obtaining local seeds for the farmer's area) - While beneficial, this is a specific *method* within agriculture, not a general factor that makes it favorable.



Therefore, option A directly addresses the core message of the passage regarding the importance of the farmer's needs for successful agriculture."
yaepum krushikarmaye bhawithaya niwaerediwa wisthara karanne pahatha sandahan karunu walin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: eya mulumaninma kaabanika paddhathiyaki** (It mainly relies on organic methods).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) clearly states:** ""boho vita kaabanika kramavedayaki"" (simple, many carbon-based methods). This directly points to organic farming practices.  It also mentions avoiding chemical fertilizers and pesticides (""thaaksanayan ha samyuktava parisara kalaapayata avenika bija bhavithayen sidu karanu labana sarala"").
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: eya asvaenna uparima kirimata anan‍ya thaak‍shanika k‍rarama bhawitha karai** (It is cultivated using an unparalleled instantaneous method) - The passage suggests simplicity, not a complicated or instantaneous method.
    * **C: eya govinta owunge wagawan owunge kalapaya pura beda gaeneemata ida salasayi** (It is said to fully satisfy the farmer and their environment) - While desirable, the passage doesn't *state* complete satisfaction, but rather the *potential* for it.
    * **D: eya thawamath samahara ratawala govin wisin bhawithakaranu laebe** (It will be cultivated by farmers across the island) - The passage talks about past and potential future practices, but doesn't promise widespread cultivation.

**Therefore, option A is the most accurate reflection of the described farming practice as detailed in the passage.**

kavuthukaagarayak naerabima kumana sanchaaraka p‍rabhedayata ayath weda?,"The correct answer is **B: winodathmaka sanchaaraka karmanthaya (leisure/recreational tourism)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...*vinodatmaka sanchaaraka karmaanthaya*."" (leisure tourism).  It then describes how people incorporate fun and enjoyment (""*vinoda weemata*"") into their daily lives and how parks and recreation areas cater to this type of tourism.  The entire passage focuses on travel motivated by pleasure and entertainment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: wyaaparika sanchaaraka karmanthaya (business tourism):** The text doesn't discuss travel for work or commerce.
*   **C: sanskruthika sanchaaraka karmanthaya (cultural tourism):** While the text *mentions* historical and cultural understanding as a *result* of travel, the primary focus isn't *seeking* cultural experiences as the *reason* for travel. It's a byproduct of where people choose to have fun.
*   **D: elimahan sanchaaraka karmanthaya (major tourism):** This is too vague and not directly addressed in the text.

"mema chedayata anuwa, winodathmaka sanchaarakayinge p‍ramukhathawayak wiya haekke kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: owunge dainika katayuthu walin witawekayak labaa gaeneema** (gaining insight into their daily lives).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that ""vinodatmaka sanchaaraka karmaanthaya"" (leisure travelers) connect with locals and experience their everyday lives.** It states they ""weave themselves into the ordinary daily lives of people.""  The passage talks about observing how people live, not necessarily focusing on historical significance, cultural trade, or specific landmarks.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: desheeya sanskruthiyata anugatha vima (following the national culture):** While leisure travelers *experience* culture, the passage doesn't state their primary goal is to strictly *follow* it.
* **C: vaedgath bim salakunu naerabima (covering various geographical locations):** The passage acknowledges travelers visit different places, but this isn't the *defining characteristic* of leisure travel as described. It also mentions they might focus on one area.
* **D: sthaanayaka ithihasaya therum gaeneema (understanding the local history):**  History is mentioned as *a potential benefit* of visiting a place with historical significance, but it's not the core focus of leisure travel described here. The focus is on the daily lives of people.



Therefore, option B best reflects the central idea presented in the passage regarding leisure travelers."

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*pudgalayan hata sahayak labini. Evaeni sarthakathvaye kathandara, wenasweema sandaha wana biya adu kala athara idiri kalaye venaskam kerehi dhanatmaka nabhuruwak aethi karana ladi.*""  This translates to ""...individuals receive assistance. Therefore, concerning the story of success, a doubt arises about the future, and the potential for profitable development arises from exploring current opportunities.""  This directly links to understanding the present state of entrepreneurship (""vyavasayakathva haesireeme saarthaka awasthaa"") as being key to overcoming doubts and finding new directions, especially in relation to local temples (""pradeshiya devasthaanaya"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: sanwidhaanaye sanskruthiyata balapaem kala pudgalayin pilibanda gaemburu awabodhayak labaa gaeneema** (gaining a deep understanding of individuals connected to the cultural constitution) - While mentioned in the passage, it's not the direct answer to the question of what helps in understanding doubts about the future of local temples.
* **C: sanwidhaanaye gaamaka balawega soyaa gaeneema** (understanding the rural power structure of the constitution) -  This is a tangential point, not the primary focus.
* **D: sanwidhaanaye ithihasaya awabodha kara gaeneema** (understanding the history of the constitution) - The passage stresses the importance of *current* understanding, not just historical understanding.

The passage states: ""Evaeni sarthakathvaye kathandara, wenasweema sandaha wana biya adu kala athara idiri kalaye venaskam kerehi dhanatmaka nabhuruwak aethi karana ladi.""  This translates to: ""In this narrative of meaningfulness, a doubt arises whether future investigations will yield a valuable new perspective.""

This directly addresses the question of what kind of doubt arises from understanding history and culture. The other options are mentioned in the passage but don't represent the *doubt* that arises.

igeneema sandaha wana pashchaath noothana p‍raweshaya niwaerediwa wisthara karanne pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashayangen kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: samahara igenum athdaekeem anek ewata wada p‍rayojanawath we** (Many past experiences are useful for many future things).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on how past experiences (igenuma sandaha) contribute to future understanding and action (noothana pravesayan).** It states they provide a basis for decision-making, even if not a perfect or complete one. It emphasizes learning from the past to navigate the present and future.
* **Option A** directly reflects this central idea – that past experiences have practical application to future situations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: igeneema apa athwindinu aethaeyi wishvasa karana dewal kerehi awadhaanaya yomu kala yuthuya** (The past is a place to trust and pay attention to in the future) - While the passage *values* the past, it doesn’t frame it as a place to simply ""trust"" or ""pay attention to.""  It’s about *using* the past.
* **C: samahara igenum k‍rama anek ewata wada hondayi** (Many past processes are good for many things) - The passage doesn't specifically focus on ""processes"" being good, but rather the experiences themselves being valuable.
* **D: igeneemedee kisidu nirapek‍shathawayak nomaetha** (There are no dependencies in the past) - This is the opposite of what the passage implies. The passage is *about* the dependency and influence of the past on the present and future.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate and comprehensive answer, capturing the core message of the text."

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) talks about gaining benefits (labā dī) from past experiences (igena sandaha) when entering new situations (nūthana pravesayan).** It emphasizes that these experiences lead to leadership and prominence (pramukathwaya labā diya yuthuya) in new endeavors.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: thorathuru igena gaeneemata boho k‍rama thibe** -  While the passage *mentions* many experiences, it doesn't focus on just a variety of them. It's about the *impact* of those experiences.
* **C: igeneeme athdaekeem igena ganna thaenaeththa saha idiripathkarana daenuma matha randa pawathee** - This refers to either gaining or losing based on past actions, which is touched upon but not the central theme.
* **D: api kawadawath bhawitha nokarana daenuma thawamath igena gaeneemata watee** - This talks about not being emotionally affected by past experiences, which is *contrary* to the passage's message of *utilizing* those experiences.

**Therefore, option B best captures the core message of the passage – that past experiences provide a foundation for achieving leadership and success in new situations.**

"saaman‍ya nida gaeneeme kaalaya thula hithamathama awadi vimen pasuwa, mevayin nindata badhaa kirime kriyaawaliyata maedihath vimata ida aeththe kumakda?","The question asks what actions are suggested in the passage to improve sleep quality if you wake up frequently during the night (between 10-60 minutes). Let's break down the passage:

* **It suggests avoiding stimulants:** specifically mentioning reducing water intake and diuretics before bed to minimize nighttime urination.
* **It mentions creating a relaxing environment:**  implies creating a comfortable and peaceful atmosphere.
* **It discourages forceful attempts to fall back asleep:** advises against struggling or worrying, and suggests allowing yourself to drift off naturally.

Now let's look at the options:

* **A: naewata nida gaeneemata pera paeya eka hamarak kiyavima** -  ""Something mentioned about drinking before going to sleep."" - This is too vague and doesn't capture the *specific* advice regarding *reducing* fluids.
* **B: vaesikiliya bhawitha kirima saha naewatha nindata yaama** - ""Creating a comfortable environment and going to sleep."" - This is a general statement, but doesn't address the waking up *during* the night issue.
* **C: aenda asala mesaya matha elam oralosuwa kriyaa witarahithakara winadi 20 kata pasu naewatha nindata yaama** - ""Don't force anything or do any relaxing activities for 20 minutes and then go to sleep."" - This aligns with the passage's advice *not* to struggle to fall back asleep.  It's the closest match.
* **D: aenda asala mesaya matha bothalayen jalaya panaya kirimata awadi vima** -  ""Don't force anything or avoid drinking water."" -  This is partially correct regarding avoiding *excess* water, but misses the point about not trying to force sleep.

**Therefore, the best answer is C.** It encapsulates the key advice about not actively trying to fall back asleep and allowing yourself to relax.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""Oba sampurnayen avadi nokara sihigaenvimata paemina weema sandaha saumya elaam oralosuvak magin meya pahasuven sidu kala haekiya."" This translates to ""Even if you can't fully enjoy it, try to continue for a short period (10-60 seconds) while focusing on your breathing.""  It acknowledges discomfort but encourages *attempting* to continue despite it.
* **It also states:** ""Obey ninde oralosuva nawatha sakasanne nam, eya kamaraye anek paette thabiya haeki athara, evita eya akriya kirimata aenden nagitimata obata bala karayi."" This means ""If you find it difficult to focus on your breathing, it may be due to various reasons, but don't give up on trying to do it.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eya jiwa widyaathmaka ridmaya matha padanam wiya haekiya** (It is a mental or physical exercise) - While true, this doesn't answer the question of what to do if it's difficult.
* **B: ilakkaya wanne oba sampurnayenma awadi novimai** (If it's difficult, you don't have to enjoy it at all) - This is the *opposite* of what the passage advises.  It encourages trying even if it's not enjoyable.
* **C: mema kriyaawaliya obe saaman‍ya nidi kaalaya thula sidu we** (This exercise will fit into your usual sleep schedule) - This is irrelevant to the question of difficulty.



Therefore, option **D** best summarizes the advice given in the passage: continue even if it's difficult, even for a short time, and don't stop trying."
"molaya nithara nithara sihina daekeemata uthsaha karana wita, eyin vaedi wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: REM thathwayan pramanaya** (REM sleep stage).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses dreams (paehaedili sihina daekima) being vivid and often arising during a specific state.** It mentions a long period of scientific investigation into the commonality of dreams.  It also connects the vividness of dreams to a loosening of reality testing and a feeling of being naturally embodied.
* **The question (Q) asks what stage of sleep is associated with enthusiastic dreaming.**
* **REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep is the stage of sleep most strongly associated with vivid dreams.**  The passage heavily implies the investigation centers around REM sleep, calling it ""REM thathwayan"" and referencing its duration (""athara kaalaya dirgha kireema"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: shakthi mattama (energy levels)** - While energy levels can affect sleep, they aren't specifically linked to vivid dreaming in the passage.
* **C: prakurthi thathwayata path vime diga (natural sleep stages)** - Too general. The passage focuses on *one* specific stage.
* **D: REM thathwayan athara kaalaya (REM sleep duration)** - While the duration is *mentioned* it's not *why* dreams are enthusiastic. The state of sleep *causes* the enthusiastic dreams.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."

Here's why:

* **The Passage (P)** discusses dreams (paehaedili sihina daekima) and how they're often vivid and feel real, but emphasizes they aren't necessarily a true reflection of reality.  It mentions the scientific understanding of dreams taking a long time to develop. It links these vivid dreams specifically to REM sleep (""Raathriyakata vada adu samanya praamana samagin..."").
* **The Question (Q)** asks about how much REM sleep is needed to experience vivid dreams and have the mind/body connect with these experiences.
* **Option B** directly addresses this, stating that *one* night of REM sleep is sufficient to experience these effects.  The passage implies REM sleep is the key to experiencing these kinds of dreams.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: REM thathwayan athara keti kaalaya** (REM for several days) - The passage states understanding dreams took a *long time*, not that REM sleep needs to last for days.
* **C: paehaedili sihina daekeema matha randa paewatheema** (Dreams are just what the mind creates) - While the passage suggests dreams aren't necessarily real, it doesn't say they are *just* creations of the mind.  It focuses on the *experience* of dreams tied to REM sleep.
* **D: ek rath‍riyak sandaha wana REM vaedi vima** (A single night's sleep with REM is unnecessary) - This contradicts the passage, which implies a strong connection between REM sleep and experiencing vivid dreams.

"mema chedayata anuwa, samp‍radayika kandayam saha athathya kandayam eka ha samana wanne keseda?","The correct answer is **B: kandayam dekatama owunge edineda katayuthu waladee wiwidha mattamwala svayaththathavak aetha** (meaning: both types of narratives are shaped by their own unique perspectives and interpretations).

Here's why:

* **The passage contrasts ""samp‍radayika kandayam"" (traditional narrative) and ""athathya kandayam"" (modern narrative).** It states that both are influenced by their respective regional artistic qualities and different time periods, leading to unique interpretations and social cohesion.  This aligns directly with option B – diverse interpretations and self-expression.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kandayam deke kriyaakaarithwaya ekama mattamakin thibenu aethaeyi apekshaa kere** (both narratives have the same functional structure) - The passage emphasizes *differences* in how they operate, not sameness.
* **C: kandayam dekama adrushyamana kalamanakarana kandayamakata vaartha karai** (both narratives talk about the invisible artistic narrative) - The passage mentions the ""adrsyamana kandaayama"" (invisible narrative) primarily as a characteristic of *modern* narratives, not both.
* **D: kandayam dekama ekama kaala kalapayaka kriyaathmaka we** (both narratives are active within a single timeframe) - The passage states they are influenced by *different* time periods.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate reflection of the comparison made in the provided text."

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Athathya kandaayam samaajikayin nitharama thamange aasannathama bhautika kandaayame sambandhatha sthaanaya lesa kriya karayi.""  This directly translates to ""The ideal type operates with reference to the empirical type, focusing on its relationship.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't state the empirical type is *always* more authoritative. It focuses on the *relationship* between the two.
* **C:**  The passage implies a connection, not independence, between the two types.  The ideal type is built *around* understanding the empirical type.
* **D:** While the passage mentions different time periods impacting the ideal type, the core point is about the relationship with the empirical type, not simply receiving feedback from it over time.

thruptha n‍yaayan hi kendragatha nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: kenekuge parisaraya owunge kriyaawanta balapana aakaaraya** (someone's surroundings shape their actions).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) focuses on how a person's environment and the consequences of their actions (what they do and don't do) influence their character and beliefs.**  It states that the *nyayan* (principle) examines how people are shaped by their surroundings (""ovunge vatapitaave aethi de balapana andama mema nyayan magin vimasayi"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: vaedihiti wiyedee saebae wana nawa aashawan** (new hopes born from established wisdom) - This is a vague idea and isn't the central theme of the passage.
* **C: abhyanthara awashyatha** (internal needs) - While internal needs are *part* of what shapes a person, the passage emphasizes external factors more.
* **D: minisunge ruchikathwayan awabodha kara gaeneema** (understanding people's preferences) -  This is about understanding *what* people like, not *why* they are the way they are.

**The question (Q) asks what the *trupta n‍yaayan* (satisfied principle) focuses on.**  The passage clearly establishes that it centers around the influence of environment on actions and therefore character.  Therefore, option B is the best answer.

Here's why, based on the provided passage (P):

The passage describes building a visual form (gathika bhava nirmanaya) through a simple guiding principle.  It emphasizes *perspective* – viewing the primary object (""pradhaana vastuva"") from different viewpoints (""tiriya yuthu vadaatma sudusu sthaanaya"") and using lines (""bedana rekhavala"") to define its form.  

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: wasthuwak thula jiwitathaya saha shakthiya nirmanaya kirima** (creating the object's full life and power) - While artistic expression can *result* in this, the passage focuses on the *method* of construction, not the final feeling.
* **C: wasthuwa nishchitha ha phaladaayee sthaanayaka thabaa gaeneema** (establishing the object in a definite and fruitful place) - This speaks to placement and meaning, not the initial drawing process.
* **D: rupayak thula piliwelak aethi kirima** (bringing a shape fully to the canvas) -  This is too late in the process. The passage describes *how* to begin defining the shape, not completing it.

The key phrase in P is  ""...tirasa saha siras athata rupaya tunakata bedana rekhavala anther jedanaya bavayi"" (building by connecting lines from different perspectives). This directly aligns with option A, which discusses creating foundational lines based on perspective.

mi.mee.35 chayaarupa aakruthiya wisthara nokaranne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: eyata boho saaman‍ya aakruthiwalata wada wenas aakaarayaka darshananupathayak aetha** (It has an aspect ratio similar to many common formats (like APS-C)).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the 3:2 aspect ratio of the 35mm format is *similar* to many common formats, like APS-C. This is the core point being made about the 35mm format's characteristics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eya thawamath nishpadanaye pawathee** (It's responsible for image production) - While the format *influences* image production, it isn't the sole producer.
* **B: eya dijital kaemara aakruthi wisin sammatha karana ladee** (It's a size matched by digital camera sensors) - The passage mentions sensors being *influenced* by the 35mm format, but doesn’t say it's a direct match.  There are variations.
* **D: eya lokaye wadathma podu aakruthiyayi** (It's a widely used format in the world) - While true, this is not the *specific* point the passage is making about the 35mm format's *aspect ratio*.  The passage focuses on its relationship to other formats.

"mema chedayata anuwa, nishpadakayin kaacha nishpadanaye gunathmakabhawaya vaedikarana wita, wishalana kaacha vaedi diyunukara aeththe keseda?","The correct answer is **C: owunge chayaarupaye gunathmakabhawaya sthaawara naabhi durak sahitha kaacha walata samana we**.

Here's why:

* **The Passage Focuses on Quality & Comparison:** The passage heavily discusses how the quality of production is related to the ""visalana kaachavala"" (broad perspective/scope). It specifically mentions alignment with ""sthaavara naabhiya durak sahitha kaacha magin labaagat gunatmaka bhavayata samaana pintura nipadaweemata"" – meaning alignment with quality stemming from a stable foundation.

* **Option C Directly Reflects This:** Option C directly translates to ""its quality is aligned with the scope including a stable foundation."" This is the core idea presented in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ewata ihala kaacha wegayak aetha** (""there is a large speed of scope"") - While speed is mentioned, it's not the primary focus of the passage.  The passage emphasizes *quality* derived from a holistic view.
* **B: adu aaloka thathwayan yatathe ewa bhawitha kirimata pahasuya** (""it is beneficial to illuminate that way"") - This is a fragment of a thought within the passage but doesn't represent the central idea being asked about.
* **D: ewaye nabheeya dura sankeernathawa pradhaana kaachayata wada aduya** (""that is beyond the complexity of the visible distance to the primary scope"") - This talks about complexity and distance, which are mentioned but not the *main* point about production quality.



Therefore, **C** best summarizes the answer to the question about how production quality relates to the broad perspective (""visalana kaacha"")."
"mema chedaye aethi thorathuru matha padanamwa, wishalana kaachayak p‍radhaana kaachayakata wada sudusu wanne kawadada?","The correct answer is **A: ihala uparima wiwaraya p‍ramukhathawayak we nam** (If the higher upper limit is important, then).

Here's why:

The passage repeatedly emphasizes the *upper limit* or *maximum value* (""uparima vivaraya,"" ""ihala pramiti""). The entire discussion revolves around needing to understand and define this upper limit to effectively manage the ""visalana kaachaya"" (broad coverage).  The passage states: ""Kachaye uparima vivaraya (vegaya) saamanyayen pahala ekak weema visalana kacha wala thavat avasiyak wanne ya."" (Is it not essential to first understand the upper limit of the coverage to have broad coverage?)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: obata adu kaacha sanrachaka awashya we nam** (Do you need a coverage structure?):  While structure might be helpful, the passage focuses specifically on the *limit* of the coverage, not its internal structure.
* **C: aduru aaloka thaththwayan thula dee obata flaesh bhawitha kirimata awashya naethinam** (You don't necessarily need to flash light quickly to get a clear picture): This is a detail about a specific method mentioned in the last sentence and isn't the central theme.
* **D: obata vaedi nabheeya sankeernathawayak awashya wanne nam** (Do you need complex navigational requirements?): While complexity is mentioned, it's presented as a consequence of needing to understand the upper limit, not as the primary need itself.



Therefore, understanding the higher upper limit is the most crucial aspect according to the provided text."
gupthavadaya pilibanda niwaeredi wistharayak lesa nosaelakenne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: gupthavadaye anugamikayan diwyamaya yathaarthaya pilibanda owunge widasun saha theekshana buddhiya poshanaya kirimata upakaaree wana piliweth anugamanaya kala haekiya.**

Here's why:

* **The Passage Focuses On:** The passage describes followers (anugamikayo) seeking a direct (riju) and unique (advitiya) understanding of divine reality (divyamaya yathaarthaya) and spiritual truth (adyaatmika sathaya).  It highlights how they nurture this understanding with sharp intellect (theekshna buddhiya) and follow a life path (jivana maarga) that leads to advancement (purudu nonawathi pawathwaagena yathi).

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Focuses on *creating* wonder, not the core pursuit of understanding.
* **B:** Mentions spiritual truth, but doesn't emphasize the intellectual nourishment and the *method* of seeking understanding.
* **D:** While it mentions a direct understanding, it's a fragment of the broader message and doesn't capture the holistic pursuit described in the passage.



Therefore, option C best summarizes the passage’s discussion of how followers of this esoteric tradition approach and benefit from their beliefs."
"mema chedayata anuwa, gupthavadaye kendraya nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: hawul, podu athdaekeem haraha theekshana buddhiya labaa gaeneema** (meaning: yes, gaining sharp intellect to understand the core truth).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) focuses heavily on attaining direct, insightful understanding (athdaekim) of divine reality (divyamaya yathaarthaya), spirituality (adyaatmika sathya), and the nature of existence.** It emphasizes using a sharp intellect (tikshna buddhiyen yuthu) to reach this understanding.  The passage describes how followers nourish this understanding to progress on the path to enlightenment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: diwyamaya yathaarthaya thula sahaja buddhiya sevima** (serving the divine reality with simple intellect) - While the divine reality is important, the passage stresses *understanding* it with a *sharp* intellect, not just serving it with a simple one.
* **C: wingaanaya pilibanda p‍reethimath thathwayak kerehi awadhaanaya yomu kirima** (paying attention to philosophical principles regarding inquiry) -  The passage is about *achieving* insight, not just studying philosophical principles.
* **D: dewiyan pilibanda sawingaanika daenuwathbhawayak labaa gaeneema** (gaining intuitive knowledge about deities) -  Deities are mentioned, but the ultimate goal isn't just gaining knowledge *about* them, but understanding the underlying reality they represent.



Therefore, option B most accurately reflects the central theme of the passage – the importance of developing a sharp intellect to grasp the core truth (athdaekim)."
"mema chedayata anuwa, krushikaarmika samajayak aarambha kale kawurun wiya haekida?","The correct answer is **C: polineesiyaawe maori janathawa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...krushikarmika samaajayak sthapitha karamin moriorivarungen navasilantaya atpat karagat yana adahasa, mema mataya sthapitha kaleya.""  This translates to ""...agricultural societies were established by the Maori of Polynesia when they arrived in New Zealand, establishing this foundation.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly states that the *Polynesian Maori* initiated the agricultural societies.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, maoree warun dadayam kala kandayama palamu vaesiyan wuye kumana sthaanayeda?","The correct answer is **B: nawaseelanthaya** (New Zealand).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Navasilantaye mull waaseen mao nam yodha paksin dadayam kala maori janathava..."" which translates to ""The Maori people first arrived on the shores of New Zealand..."".  The question asks where the Maori people *first* arrived.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: pradhaana bhoomiya** (mainland) - While the Maori eventually settled the mainland, the passage emphasizes New Zealand as their initial landing point.
*   **C: chaetham doopath** (Chatham Islands) - The passage discusses the Moriori people inhabiting the Chatham Islands, *after* the Maori arrived in New Zealand.
*   **D: polineesiyaawa** (Polynesia) - Polynesia is the larger region from which they migrated, not the first place they landed.

piyarland origami k‍ramaya bhawitha kirimen namannanta p‍rayojanawath wanne kumana awasthaawedee da?,"The correct answer is **B: namanna sathuwa usas motar haekiyaawan aetha** (meaning: along with the name, it was useful for those who had limited motor skills).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""...athdaekim rahitha namannanta how seemitha motor haekiyaawan yuth ayata upaakarayak lesa john smith visin sanvardhanaya kaleya"" which translates to ""...as a benefit to youth with limited motor skills, John Smith developed it.""  This directly connects the origami to helping those with motor skill limitations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: namannan ekawara naemeem keepayak kirimata kaemaeththak dakwayi** (meaning: it was only a way to keep the name alive) - The passage doesn't focus on *keeping a name alive*, but on the *practical benefit* the origami provided.
* **C: namanna naewatha naemeem awashya karana origami nirmanayakarai** (meaning: origami makers who necessarily need the name) - The passage doesn't discuss requirements for origami makers.
* **D: namanna meeta pera warak ho dewarak pamanak eya uthsahakara aetha** (meaning: it encouraged them after a certain period or distance) - This is not mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, option B is the only one directly supported by the information in the passage.



"
piyarland origami niwaerediwa wisthara nokaranne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: eya palapurudu namannan sandaha nirmanaya kara aetha** (It creates a sculptural form from a single sheet of paper).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** describes Pureland origami as originating in the 1970s with John Smith, and importantly, emphasizes that it *creates a three-dimensional form from a single sheet of paper* (""siyalu naemim riju sthana sahitha we"" - literally, ""with a three-dimensional space from a single sheet"").  It contrasts this with simpler origami.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: mema k‍ramayata naewatha naemeem aethulath nowe** (This method doesn't use multiple sheets) - While true, this doesn't *answer* the question of what Pureland origami *is*.  It just states a characteristic.
* **C: naemeem walata riju sthaana thibiya yuthuyi** (It's a method that gives three-dimensional space to the paper) -  This is a restatement of a characteristic, not a defining description.
* **D: seemitha motar haekiyaawan aethi namannan sandaha eya honda k‍ramayaki** (It's a good method developed by a person with limited motor skills) - The passage mentions John Smith had limited motor skills, but this isn't *what* Pureland origami *is* – it's about *how* it came to be.



Therefore, option A best captures the essence of Pureland origami as described in the passage – the creation of a sculpture from a single sheet."
"mema chedayata anuwa, indu nimna shishtachaaraya ha sambandha nowana sthaanaya kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: harappawa**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...eya indu sarasvati sistaachaaraya lesa nam kala yuthu wana athara harappavata pasu eyata harappa sistaachaaraya lesa samaharu handunvati..."" which translates to ""...and it is called the Indus-Saraswati civilization, and because of Harappa, it is compared to the Harappa civilization..."".  

Therefore, the text directly links the Indus/Saraswati civilization (the topic of discussion) to Harappa.  The first bone found relating to this civilization was in 1920, further reinforcing this connection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: saraswathee gaga:** While the Saraswati River is mentioned, it's in relation *to* the civilization, not the location *of* the civilization.
* **C: eesanadiga aefganisthaanaye siyaluma p‍radesha:** The text mentions Afghanistan as an area *connected* to India in the broader context of a larger region, but it's not the primary location of this specific civilization.
* **D: noothana pakisthanaye boho p‍radesha:** While the civilization is *in* modern-day Pakistan, Harappa is the specific site that defines and identifies it.



"
mema chedaye paehaedili karana lada lokada yugaye shishtachaaraya sandaha yodagatha haeki namak lesa sandahan kara nomaeththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: indu-saraswathee shishtachaaraya** (Indus-Saraswati civilization).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions ""Indu Saraswati shishtachaaraya"" (Indus-Saraswati civilization) several times.** It discusses how this civilization is related to the region, its prosperity, and its connection to Harappa.
* The passage talks about the Indus river (Indu gange) and Saraswati river being central to this civilization.
* The passage also mentions Harappa and its connection to this civilization.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: harappanu shishtachaaraya (Harappan civilization):** While Harappa is *part* of the civilization, the passage emphasizes the broader Indus-Saraswati context.
* **C: indu ganga shishtachaaraya (Indus-Ganga civilization):**  The Ganga river's importance comes *after* this period in Indian history.  The passage focuses on the Indus and Saraswati rivers.
* **D: indu nimna shishtachaaraya (Lower Indus civilization):** This is too specific and doesn’t encompass the full scope described in the passage.  The passage implies a broader geographical area.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, digu kaaleena p‍rathilabha labaa gatha haekke pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: an aya samaga sahayogayen katayuthu kirima** (cooperating with others).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) emphasizes the benefit of collaboration.** It states that working with others ( *an aya samaga*) and helping each other (*sahayogaye svabhavaya*) leads to greater gains.  The passage suggests that a mindful approach, combined with collaboration, is key to success.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: kenekuge aathmarthakaameethwayata p‍ramukhathawaya deema** (prioritizing someone else's self-interest) - The passage focuses on *mutual* benefit, not prioritizing others *over* yourself.
* **C: bahutharayata wada sulutharayata p‍rayojanawath wanne kumakda yanna awadhaaranaya kirima** (understanding how to use strengths and weaknesses) - While useful, this isn't the *main* point of the passage. It's a tactic that *supports* collaboration, but isn't the core message.
* **D: thanhawa p‍rayojanawath wiya haeki bawa handuna gaeneema** (taking responsibility for one's own needs) - This is also a good principle, but the passage is focusing on how to amplify those benefits *through working with others*.



Therefore, **A** best reflects the central idea of the passage: the power of cooperation."
"mema chedayata anuwa, kenekuta k‍shanika awashyatha gaena saelakilimath wanne nam, owunta p‍ramukhathawaya deemata haekke pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **D: aathmarthakaamithwaya (ආත්මර්ථකාමිතවය)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses the nature of self-interest (aathmarthakami) and how acting in self-interest can often lead to greater benefits.** It emphasizes that even actions *seemingly* self-serving can indirectly help others.
* **The question (Q) asks what happens when someone is motivated by fleeting desires.**  This contrasts directly with the long-term, thoughtful self-interest discussed in the passage.  Someone driven by *fleeting* desires is essentially pursuing *immediate* gratification of self, not the considered, beneficial self-interest described.
* **Aathmarthakaamithwaya** translates to ""self-determination"" or ""pursuit of self-interest.""  This fits the context of the passage, as it’s about how understanding and acting on one's own goals (self-interest) can ultimately be fruitful.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: pararthakaameethwaya (පරර්ථකාමිතවය)** – Altruism, concern for others.  This is the *opposite* of what the passage is primarily discussing.
* **B: sahayogeethawa (සහයෝගීතාව)** – Cooperation. While the passage touches on how self-interest can *lead* to cooperation, it's not the central theme.
* **C: sahayogaya (සහයෝගය)** – Cooperation. Similar to B, it's a result, not the driving force.



Therefore, **aathmarthakaamithwaya** best captures the underlying principle explored in the passage, and provides the most logical response to the question about pursuing fleeting desires."
"mema chedayata anuwa, yuddhaye pirivaeyen wishala kotasak gewwe kawuda?","The correct answer is **A: pilipeena rajaya (Philippine state)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pilipina rajaye namin ipilinu baedhumkarawala poliya saha viyadamvala pradhaana kotasak daerima sandaha wall streit baenku ayathana haraha...""  This directly translates to ""The Philippine state had major holdings in Wall Street banks and policy/investment decisions...""  The passage is talking about the large financial stakes *the Philippine state* had.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: wol street baenku (Wall Street banks):** While the Philippine state *held* stakes in them, the banks themselves weren't the entity facing the consequences of American imperialism.
* **C: aemarikaanu yatath witajitha palanaya (American conquered rule):** This is the *cause* of the problem, not the entity experiencing the financial consequences.
* **D: pilipeena janathawa (Philippine people):** While the people ultimately suffered, the passage focuses on the *state's* financial dealings.



"
templarwarunge yugayata pera paewathiye kumana yugayada?,"The correct answer is **A: madhyakaaleena yugaye aga** (the latter part of the medieval period).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""mema siduvim sidu woo kaalaya saamanyayen yuropiya ithihasaye ihala madyakalina avadhiye 11, 12 saha 13 satavarsa washayen saelake (kri.wa. 1000-1300)."" - This translates to ""This period generally falls within the High Medieval period of European history, spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (A.D. 1000-1300).""
* **The passage also indicates** this is towards the *end* of the High Medieval period, leading into the Late Medieval period.
* **Therefore:** The Templar era falls within the latter part of the medieval period.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 12 wana shathawarshaya (the 12th century):** While the Templars were active in the 12th century, their period spanned the 11th, 12th *and* 13th centuries.
* **C: mul madhyakaaleena yugaya (the early medieval period):**  The passage specifically places them in the *High* Medieval period, *after* the Early Medieval period.
* **D: 13 wana shathawarshaya (the 13th century):** Again, while active in the 13th century, their era wasn't *limited* to it.



"
templarwarunge yugayen pasu paeminiye kumana yugayada?,"The correct answer is **C: ihala madhyakaaleena yugaya** (High Medieval Period).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the Templar period falls within the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (roughly 1000-1300), which is defined as the *ihala madhyakaaleena yugaya* (High Medieval Period). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: madhyakaaleena yugaye aga** (Early Medieval Period) - This is *before* the Templar period.
*   **B: 12 wana shathawarshaya** (12th century) - While the Templars were active *during* the 12th century, this is only *part* of their timeframe.
*   **D: 11 wana shathawarshaya** (11th century) -  Similar to B, this is a portion of their time, not the encompassing period.



"
roma adhiraajya yugaya thula waidyawarun ha shal‍ya waidyawarun wisin bhawitha karana lada bawata sandahan nowana waidya p‍rathikaaraya ho kriyaa patipatiya kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: dhahamani kalampa samaga rudhiraya gala yaama valakva gaeneema** (using tourniquets and stopping bleeding).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically mentions:** ""Rogeen thuwala odu diweema menma le gala yaama walakana tiringa saha dhamani kalampavalin rudhiraya gala ema walakwa gaenimata pasuwa ovun amgachedanaye pravinayan bavata pathwi ya.""  This translates to: ""They were skilled in stopping bleeding from wounds, using tourniquets and methods to stop blood flow from veins and arteries.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: wiwidha awasaditha samaga pashchaath kampana sahagatha aathathi aabadhayata prathikaara kirima** (treating various depressions and post-traumatic stress) - The passage doesn't mention psychological treatments.
* **B: skopolamain nissaranaya sandaha shakasara beeja bhawitha kirima** (using scopolamine extracted from plants) - While scopolamine is mentioned as a pain reliever, the passage doesn't say it was *the* key advance.
* **D: gaengreen rogeenge awayawa kapa iwath kirima** (amputating limbs affected by gangrene) -  The passage doesn't mention amputation.  Stopping bleeding and wound management were the emphasized surgical advances.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the text."
"mema chedayata anuwa, roma adhirajyaye waidya k‍sheth‍raye sidu wu diyunuwata sambandha nowanne pahatha sandahan dae walin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: adhirajyaye aak‍ramanasheelee hamuda p‍rathipaththiya** (the empire's aggressive and warlike nature).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the Roman Empire's warlike nature *led to* advancements in medicine. It explains how battlefield injuries (resulting from war) drove the development of surgical techniques (amputations, wound care, dealing with arteries), and how painkillers like morphine and scopolamine were developed to treat war-related pain. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: waidya balakaa pihituvima** (development of medical forces) - While the passage mentions a Roman medical corps, it's a *result* of the need for battlefield medicine, not the *cause* of its advancement.
* **C: igenum rohalak pihituvima** (development of treatment for diseases) - The passage focuses heavily on *trauma* medicine, not disease treatment.  While disease was present, the driving force described is war.
* **D: adhirajyayaage waidyawarun bandava gaeneema** (the empire's association with physicians) -  Again, this is a consequence, not the initial driving force.



"
daekeeme haekiyaawa kumak matha randa pawatheeda?,"The correct answer is **B: jiwiyekuge awashyatha** (the needs of living beings).

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""Jiviyaage lingika awashyatha mata padanamwa sankirna paraasayak thula pawathina aesvala vividha akara thibe."" This translates to ""Various forms arise due to the complexity of fulfilling the needs of living beings.""  The question (Q) asks what is being talked about in the passage.  The passage directly addresses the needs (awashyatha) of living beings (jiwiya).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: drushya paddhathiye sanwedaka indreeyan** (sensory organs of visual systems) - While vision is *mentioned* (drushya), it's not the core subject.
* **C: aethaem tharanga aayaama sanwedeethawa** (feeling wave dimensions) - This is a detail *within* the discussion of experience, not the main topic.
* **D: wiwidha theewratha mattam** (various intensities of taste) - This is a very specific example and not the overarching theme.



"
jivin athara ak‍shi wyuhaye witachalanaya randa pawathinne kumak mathada?,"The correct answer is **A: tharanga aayaama sanwedeethawa (wave-like sensation)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a complex sensory experience.** It talks about various sensations – visual (drushya panjara), feelings (sanvedana amga), and a wave-like quality (tharanga ayamayanta sanvedi).  It specifically mentions experiencing sensations ""like waves.""
* **The question (Q) asks what kind of mental state is awakened by the fluctuations of life and the visual system.** The passage directly links these fluctuations to a ""wave-like sensation.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: jivinge awashyatha (necessity of life):** While the passage touches on life's needs, it isn't the *primary* mental state awakened by the described fluctuations.
* **C: theewratha mattama (intensity of mind):** Intensity is *part* of the experience, but the core sensation is the wave-like feeling.
* **D: jivinge sankeernathwaya (complexity of life):** The passage acknowledges life's complexity, but the question asks about what's *awakened* by the fluctuations, not simply a recognition of complexity.



Therefore, **tharanga aayaama sanwedeethawa** best reflects the experience described in the passage and answers the question."
"mema chedayata anuwa, aagama niwaerediwa nirupanaya nokarana seek dhahama pilibanda wu p‍rakaashaya wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: seek dhahama yanu hindu samp‍radaye nikaayavadee bedeemwala p‍rathiphalayaki** (Sikhism arose as a reflection of various sects within Hinduism).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Seekwaru thama hindu moola ha sampradhaayaval piligattada, ovunge dahama hindu dahamata venas dahamak lesa salakati."" (Sikhs originated from Hindu roots and sects, and their religion is presented as a religion similar to Hinduism). This directly supports the idea that Sikhism is a development *within* Hinduism, influenced by its various branches.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: guru yanu seek aagamata aawenika wu mulika angayaki** (Guru is the fundamental aspect that came into Sikhism) - While the Guru is important, the passage emphasizes the *origin* within Hinduism.
* **C: mema aagame nirmathru guru nanakgen pasuwa gurun nawa denek ohuwa anugamanaya kalaha** (After the creator of this religion, Guru Nanak, nine other Gurus followed in his footsteps) - This is a true statement *about* Sikhism, but the passage focuses on *how* it came to be, not just its structure.
* **D: seek dhahame aethaem samp‍radayan hindu dhahame mul baesa aetha** (Sikhism is a tradition that is fundamentally different from Hinduism) - The passage directly contradicts this, stating it *originated* from Hindu roots and is *similar* to Hinduism.

"mema chedayata anuwa, seek wishvasaye mulika angaya lesa salakanu labanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: hindu samp‍radayan**.

Here's why:

The passage clearly states: ""Seekwaru thama hindu moola ha sampradhaayaval piligattada, ovunge dahama hindu dahamata venas dahamak lesa salakati.""  This translates to ""Sikhs originated from Hindu roots and traditions, and their religion is considered a religion similar to Hinduism.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: guru sankalpaya (Guru's Principles)** - While Gurus are important, the *origin* isn't solely based on their principles. It's rooted in existing traditions.
*   **C: wenath indiyaanu aagam piligaeneema prathik‍shepa kirima (Rejecting Indian religious systems)** - The text doesn't suggest rejection, but rather *originating* from within them.
*   **D: panjabi bhashawa katha kirima (Speaking in Punjabi)** -  While Punjabi is the language of the Gurus, it's not the foundational belief.

*   **A: pasal vaeda** (school lessons) - While the passage mentions school, it focuses on *distraction* within that environment, not the lessons themselves being the distraction.
*   **C: kaatoon naerabima** (cartoon characters) - This is *an example* of a distraction, not the overarching category of distractions.
*   **D: owun winodayen karana dewal** (things they do for fun) - This is too broad.  The passage is specific about *how* they are distracted – through activities like playing.

"mema chedayata anuwa, Avadhaana unatha aabaadhaya sahitha daruwan awadanam sahagatha haesireem wala yedeemata naemburu wanne aeyi?","The correct answer is **B: sama wayase mithuran samaga sambandha vimata owunta udaw kirimata** (helping them to relate with same-age friends).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...*eya anek sama vayas daruvan samaga sambandhatha pawathwaagaeneemata eya ovunta baadhavak aetive.*""  This translates to ""...because of their ability to relate with same-age children, it becomes an obstacle for them.""  This directly indicates the difficulty children with attention deficit have in forming relationships with peers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: adhi kreeyaakaareethwaya adu kirimata** (doing things impulsively) - While impulsivity *is* mentioned as a symptom, the passage doesn't say that's what makes dealing with the condition difficult.
*   **C: owunge demawpiyangen awadhaanaya labaa gaeneemata** (getting attention from their parents) -  The passage suggests the opposite – that the condition often *requires* extra attention from parents, and isn't about *getting* it.
*   **D: owunge molaya uththejanaya kirimata** (stimulating their brains) - The passage states they don't get stimulation in a normal way and instead self-stimulate due to the condition.



"
"mema chedaye aethi thorathuru walata anuwa, palanchiyakata udaharanayak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The passage describes a situation where someone is struggling with a new computer or software (likely Microsoft Office, hinted at by ""Microsoft Ofis hi kudaa kadadasi clip minisa da esemaya""). They are feeling overwhelmed and need help understanding the basics. They need guidance, practice, and support.

Considering this, the best answer is **B: SAT upadeshakayek (A SAT instructor/teacher)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes needing a *guruvarayeku* (teacher/expert) to understand the ""palanchiya"" (computer/software).**  The person needs someone to show them how things work, answer questions, and help them practice.  A teacher fits this role perfectly.
* **The other options are less fitting:**
    * **A: pariganaka kreedawaka aarambhaye dee maga penvima (A guide to starting computer games)** - The passage isn't about games; it's about fundamental computer skills.
    * **C: svadheena adhyayana vaedasatahanak (An independent study course)** -  The person *needs* help, so independent study isn't the solution.
    * **D: podi leeg puhunukaruwek (Small league newcomers)** - This doesn't address the need for instruction or support.



Therefore, **B** is the most logical and accurate answer based on the text."
palanchiya pilibanda sankalpaya niwaerediwa wisthara nokaranne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: palanchiya athathya lesa paewathiya haekiya** (It is mentioned as being quite flexible).

Here's why:

The passage repeatedly describes the ""palanchiya"" (presentation/slide) as being flexible (""mrudukaangaya thula abyantarikaranaya wee aethi"" - easily customizable), adaptable, and able to be used in various ways.  The passage emphasizes its ability to be shaped by the user, like a teacher shaping a student.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: eya igenum k‍ramayakata wada aadhaarayaki** (It doesn't follow a specific order or framework) - While it *can* be non-linear, the passage doesn't focus on that as a defining characteristic.
* **C: eya wyaapruthi padanam karagath igeneema lesa da haendinwe** (It is used as a method to deliver presentations) - This is *a* use, but not the primary focus of the description. The passage talks about *how* it's used, not just *that* it's used.
* **D: igeneeme athdaekeemak aarambhaye dee sahaya labaa deema sandaha palanchiya bhawitha karai** (It helps start something and provides support, emotionally affecting the presentation) - This is an overinterpretation. The passage doesn't claim emotional impact, only that it helps with the process.



Therefore, **A** is the best answer as it directly reflects the frequently mentioned characteristic of flexibility regarding the “palanchiya”."
"mema chedayata anuwa, kiyavime apahasuthawayak aethi sisunta kumana MySpace wisheshangaya p‍rayojanawath wiya haekida?","The correct answer is **A: risikaranaya (risk)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Eya kiyavimata pahasu karavima pinisa menma, kaemaeti ayurin varna adu wadi karagaenimata haeki ayurin risikaranaya karagata haekiya.""  This translates to: ""Trying to understand what is said, it seems like life's colors are fading, leading to a risk to one's lifespan.""

The question asks what specifically is being risked when trying to decipher the writing. The passage directly links the difficulty of understanding the writing to a risk to one's lifespan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: bloga (blogs)** - Blogs are mentioned as a feature of the website, but not as something risked.
* **C: ek web lipinayak (a web writing/post)** -  The writing *is* the problem, but the question asks what is *risked* by trying to understand it.
* **D: paethikada miliyana 54 (54 million users)** - The number of users is a statistic, not something put at risk.

"mema chedayata anuwa, kamkaruwange kaerali koolahalawalata krushchewge p‍rathichaaraya nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: nawa agamaethiwarayeku path kirima** (establishing a new leadership).

Here's why:

The text states that Kruschev, after facing opposition from workers regarding living conditions and wage issues, ultimately established a new leadership with Władysław Gomułka. This directly addresses the question of how Kruschev responded to the workers' protests.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: saamaya yali sthaapitha kirimata yudha taenki bhawitha kirima** (arming the established faith with military force) - The text doesn't mention military force being used against religion.
*   **C: vaetup kappaduwa vaedi kirima** (removing wage caps) - While wage issues were a *cause* of the protests, the text doesn't say Kruschev removed wage caps as a *response*.
*   **D: samahara aarthika illeem piligaeneema** (addressing significant economic problems) -  The text says Kruschev *experienced* economic difficulties, but doesn't indicate addressing them was his *response* to the protests.



"
polantha kaerali koolahalawalata hethuwa nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: komiynistvadaya** (Communism).

Here's why:

The passage states the unrest in Poland was fueled by ""kolaahala komiyunistvaadayata erehi podu virodhataavayak bavata path woo vita"" - which translates to ""opposition to the policies of communism."" This directly identifies communism as a major cause of the unrest.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: aahara higaya** (food shortages) - While mentioned as a contributing factor, the text highlights the opposition to communism as the *primary* driver.
*   **C: vaetup kappaduwa** (wage cuts) - Similar to food shortages, this is a contributing factor, not the root cause.
*   **D: wlaedislaw gomulkaa path kirima** (Władysław Gomułka's leadership) - Gomułka came *after* the unrest, as a result of it, not the cause.

"mema chedayata anuwa, USSR sha the USA athara sambandhathawayata balapaemak nowuye pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: ekinekaata paraspara kriyaawaleen** (multiple mutual interactions).

Here's why:

The passage describes how the USSR and USA, initially allies against Germany, transitioned into a decades-long Cold War after WWII. This Cold War wasn't a direct, large-scale *hot* war, but involved continuous ""interactions"" – proxy wars in places like Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, and Cuba.  It was a complex relationship of competition, ideological conflict, and strategic maneuvering.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sanskruthika wenaskam** (cultural differences) - While cultural differences *contributed* to the Cold War, the passage focuses on the *actions* and *interactions* between the two superpowers, not just the differences.
*   **B: germaniya pilibanda adhas** (based on Germany) - Germany was the initial common enemy, but the passage explains the relationship *after* Germany was defeated.
*   **D: paddhathi pilibanda aarawul** (disagreement on systems) - Disagreement on political systems (communism vs. capitalism) was a cause of the conflict, but again, the passage is about the *way* the conflict played out - through ongoing interactions.

mulu shareeraya purawatama snayu aawegayan yaevime aramuna niwaerediwa wisthara nokaranne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: rudhira gamanagamanaya mandgamee vima** (slowed blood circulation).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes the nervous system's role in maintaining bodily functions, including blood circulation.** It states that nerve impulses help regulate the overall state of the body.  It also mentions how these impulses protect and benefit the body.
* **The question (Q) asks about what can cause widespread, but not immediately obvious, physical problems.**
* **Slowed blood circulation (A) directly impacts the body's ability to function properly and would lead to subtle, widespread effects.**  It aligns with the nervous system's role in regulating circulation and the question's description of a problem that isn't immediately apparent.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: rudhira gamanagamanaya kalamanakaranaya kirima** (blood circulation stopping completely) - This is too drastic and would cause *immediate* and obvious problems, not a gradual decline.
* **C: samasthithiya nisi lesa pawathvagena yaama** (a state of slight imbalance) - While imbalance is a problem, it doesn't specifically address a physical condition and is too vague.
* **D: siduwiya haeki shareerika tharjana walakva gaeneema** (getting involved in strenuous physical activity) - This *causes* a change in the body, not a problem *with* the body.



Therefore, **A** is the most logical answer based on the provided text."
geesa maha pirameedayehi soyaagatha haekke kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: siyaluma puduma 7** (roughly translates to ""one of the seven wonders"").

Here's why:

The text (P) explicitly states: ""Ada dakwama pudhuma 7n ithiriva aethi ekama deya geesahi mahaa piramidaya we."" which means ""The Great Pyramid is one of the seven wonders of the world.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sohon** (beautiful) - While the pyramids are aesthetically impressive, the text doesn't focus on their beauty as the defining characteristic.
*   **B: pansal** (temple) -  The pyramids served as tombs, not temples.
*   **D: maha pirameedaya** (Great Pyramid) - This is *what* it is, but not *why* it's famous or noteworthy according to the text. The text highlights its status as a wonder.



"
maha pirameedaye aramuna wuye kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: parawo hata gawrawa kirima** (built to honor the pharaohs).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Kri.poo. thunvana shathavarshaye dee egypthuwarun visin idikarana lada maha piramidaya svargastha woo paravovarunta gavravaya pinisa idikarana lada vishaala piramida vyuhayangen raesak atharin ekaki.""  This translates to ""The great pyramid built by the ancient Egyptians over centuries was built to honor the heavenly pharaohs.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: lokaye puduma hathen ekak bawata pathvima** (one of the new wonders of the world) - While true, the passage *focuses on the original purpose*, not its modern recognition.
* **C: bim salakunak lesa thibeema** (standing as land features) - This is a descriptive statement, not the *reason* for building them.
* **D: miyagiya ayage sohon gabada kirima sandaha** (a combination of magical age and beautiful construction) -  The passage doesn't focus on magical elements, but rather on honoring the pharaohs through construction.

dewamaligawa gini thabaa winasha kala bhatayaa gaena apa daenuwath vimata hethu wuye yuththe kawuda?,"The correct answer is **B: maha aeleksaendar raju** (Alexander the Great).

Here's why:

The text states: ""maha aeleksaendar ipadunu rathriye ma devamaligava vinaasha viya."" (Alexander the Great destroyed the temple on a certain night.) This directly answers the question of who burned down the temple.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: epeesiyaanuwan** (Ephesians) - This isn't mentioned as the one who burned the temple.
*   **C: strabo** (Strabo) - Strabo is mentioned as a historian *reporting* about it, not as the perpetrator.
*   **D: aatemis** (Artemis) - Artemis is the deity whose temple was destroyed, not the one who destroyed it.



"

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""maha aeleksaendar ipadunu rathriye ma devamaligava vinaasha viya"" (the temple was destroyed on the night Alexander arrived) and ""kri.poo. 323 dee palliya nawatha godanagana ladi"" (it burned down in 323 BC).  This directly links the burning to Alexander's reign.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  While Alexander *is* mentioned in connection with the temple, the text doesn't say he *started* the fire to get revenge.
* **C:** The text mentions Herostratus burning the temple for fame, but *not* in relation to the temple of Artemis mentioned in the question. This refers to a different temple.
* **D:** The text specifically states it burned in 323 BC, not 320 BC.

"mema chedayata anuwa, ek jivi wisheshayak kakul dekin aewida giya mulma awasthaawa wanne kawadada?","The correct answer is **B: meeta wasara miliyana dekakata pera** (meaning ""over a million years ago"").

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Palamuwa dannaa pravaahana margaya wanne aevideemai, vasara miliyana dekakata ihatha homo erectes... mathu weemath samaga minissu aevidimata patan gathha.""  This translates to: ""Based on fossil evidence, *Homo erectus* and humans evolved from a lineage over a million years ago.""
* The question asks about the age of the earliest living being mentioned. *Homo erectus* is explicitly stated to be from over a million years ago.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: meeta wasara miliyana hathakata pera** (over 800,000 years ago) - While older ancestors existed, the passage directly links the *Homo erectus* evolution to over a million years ago.
* **C: meeta wasara miliyana 3.9 kata pera** (over 3.9 million years ago) - This refers to the age of *Australopithecus* fossils, not the earliest ancestor in the context of the passage's focus.
* **D: meeta wasara miliyana 4.2 kata pera** (over 4.2 million years ago) -  Similar to C, this refers to *Australopithecus*, not the point the passage is making about the evolution leading to *Homo erectus*.



"
boho wita paada deken aewidinne mema wishesha athurin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: dwipaada wisheshee jivin** (bipedal special species).

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses the evolution of walking upright (bipedalism).** It talks about *Homo erectus* and how they differed from earlier hominins like *Australopithecus*.  The key point is the development of walking on two legs.
* **The question asks what distinguishes these species.** The defining characteristic discussed in the passage is *dwipaada gamanaya* (bipedalism - walking on two feet).  Therefore, ""bipedal special species"" is the most fitting answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sahalanthropas:** While *Sahelanthropus* is mentioned as an earlier hominin, the passage doesn't focus on what *specifically* distinguishes it.
* **B: homo erektos:** *Homo erectus* is *an example* of a species that developed bipedalism, but it's not the *characteristic itself*.
* **D: ostrolopithakas:** *Australopithecus* are described as *precursors* who *didn't* walk as efficiently as later species, making them the opposite of the distinguishing feature.



"
dewana loka yuddhaya atharathura germanu nawika hamudawa itu kirimata uthsaha kale kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: brithanyayen ena bhaanda walata badhaa kirima** (hindering the transport of goods to Britain).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Evitama, germanu naavikayo, pradhaana washayen you-bottu adharayen, gamanaagamanaya nathara kirimata uthsaaha kalaha."" (However, German sailors primarily focused on disrupting transport using U-boats.)  And later: ""Mythrare paakshikayan asamath vuvanaam, germaniyata yuropaye ithiri kotasa yatath karagat aakarayatama brithaanyaya yatath kara gaenimata haekivannata ida tibuni."" (It was understood that by disrupting Britain, Germany hoped to conquer Europe and ultimately defeat Britain).

This directly links the German navy's efforts to *hindering the transport of goods to Britain*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: brithan‍yayata minisun saha bhaanda ema vaelaekvima** (providing people and goods to Britain) - This is the opposite of what the German navy was trying to do.
* **C: athlanthik sagaraya haraha drawya p‍ravahanaya kirima** (controlling the flow of goods across the Atlantic) - While the U-boats operated in the Atlantic, their *primary* goal wasn't just control, but disruption of British supply lines.
* **D: aemarikaawata minisun saha bhaanda ema vaelaekvima** (providing people and goods to America) - The passage focuses on the conflict between Germany and Britain, not Germany and America in this context.



"
"mema chedaye dakva aethi thorathuru anuwa, uthuru athlanthik nawika satane wishalathama saarthakathwaya athkara gaththe kawuda?","The correct answer is **C: germaniya saha b‍rithan‍yaya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""aemarikanuvan brithaanyayata sahaya daekweema pinisa, athlanthik saagaraya haraha minisun saha drarevya raegena yaamata uthsaaha kaloya. Evitama, germanu naavikayo, pradhaana washayen you-bottu adharayen, gamanaagamanaya nathara kirimata uthsaaha kalaha.""

This translates to: ""Americans provided assistance to Britain, and enthusiasm arose to dominate the Atlantic Ocean with ships and materials.  Similarly, German sailors, primarily using U-boats, showed enthusiasm to disrupt traffic.""

Therefore, both Britain (with American support) and Germany were key naval players in the North Atlantic during this period.  While America *assisted* Britain, Germany was independently active.



"
aesiriyaanuwan ashvarohaka hamuda kriyaathmaka kala wita meyin nothibune kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: saedala (சடல)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where Assyrian soldiers are collecting bodies (corpses/cadavers) after a battle. The phrase ""evakata saedalaya nipadavaa notibu athara asiriyanvaru satan kale thama asvayange aawarana rahitha pita matha hindimin ya"" translates to ""even though they didn't find bodies, eight Assyrians were making their horses' backs and hindquarters covered [with something]"". This implies they were *looking* for bodies but didn't find enough.  ""Saedala"" directly translates to ""corpse"" or ""body"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: haras dunu (හරස් දුනු)** - ""Haras dunu"" seems to refer to losses or defeat, not a physical object they were collecting.
* **C: ashwa ratha (අශ්ව රථ)** - ""Ashwa ratha"" means chariot, which isn't the focus of the text.
* **D: sannaha (සන්නහ)** - ""Sannaha"" translates to weapon, which is not what they were gathering.



Therefore, the passage is focused on the collection of **bodies (saedala)** by the Assyrian soldiers."
ashvarohaka hamudawak bhawitha karana satan waladee satan karanne keseda?,"The correct answer is **C: ashwayinge pita matha sita**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Asvaarohaka hamudaavak yanu asvayange pita matha sita satan karana hamudaavaki.""  This directly translates to ""The horse-riding training is done by the horse's father or mother.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: depa matha:** The text doesn't mention ""depa matha"" (monk/priest's mother).
* **B: sannaha nomaethiwa:** The text doesn't mention ""sannaha nomaethiwa"" (not named).
* **D: adu bhatayin samaga:** The text doesn't mention ""adu bhatayin samaga"" (with a servant).



Therefore, the answer is clearly **C**."
"mema chedayata anuwa, saaman‍ya babiloneeya puravaesiyeku soyaa gaeneemata obata nohaeki wanne kothaeninda?","The correct answer is **B: pradhaana dewasthaanayaka uthsawayakata sahabhagee vima** (a participant in the main deity's festival).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a priest (pujakavaru) enthusiastically participating in the festivals and rituals (uthsava) dedicated to the deity.** They are actively involved in fulfilling the deity's needs.
* **Option B** directly reflects this role - being a part of the main deity's festival.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: devala anganayata puja raegena ema** (someone who offers worship to the temple grounds) -  The priest does more than just worship the grounds; they conduct rituals.
* **C: devala anganayaka uthsawayakadee** (organizer of the temple grounds' festival) - The passage doesn't state the priest *organizes* the festival, but *participates* in it.
* **D: abhyanthara shuddhasthaanayakata puja gena ema** (someone who worships the inner sanctum) - While likely part of their duties, the passage emphasizes their festival involvement more broadly.



"
pujakayan sandaha wishesha yana lesa adhas kale pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: uthsawa** (festivals).

Here's why:

The text states: ""pujakavaru pujaa vidhi saha **uthsava** haraha deviyange awashyathaa sapirimata uthsaaha kalaha."" This translates to ""the priests enthusiastically fulfill the needs of the deity with puja rituals and **festivals**.""  The passage directly links the priests' enthusiastic efforts to the festivals held for the deity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: abhyanthara shuddhasthaana** (inner sanctum) - While mentioned in the text, it doesn't relate to what the priests *do* to show respect.
*   **C: aagamika mangal‍ya** (religious blessings) - This is a general concept, not a specific action.
*   **D: sigurata** (security) - This refers to the structure of the temple, not the priests' actions.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""1922 dee ohuge sohon geya soyaagaenimat samaga ohu janapriya vuveya."" (In 1922, he became popular with the discovery of his beautifully decorated tomb.)
* The passage further emphasizes the richness and preservation of artifacts *within* the tomb.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ohuge sohona mankollakaemen pasuwa** (because of his beautiful necklaces) - The passage mentions valuable artifacts, but doesn't specifically highlight necklaces as the reason for his fame.
* **B: ohuge palana kaalaye dee** (because of the length of his reign) -  The passage implies he wasn't a long-reigning pharaoh. It focuses on his *discovery* rather than his rule.
* **D: purana rajawarunge laeyisthuwe sandahan kirimen pasuwa** (because of providing the longest historical evidence of ancient kings) - While he *is* an important historical figure, the passage doesn’t state he provided the *longest* evidence.  His fame stems from his tomb.

This translates to: ""Containing a multitude of valuable and rare items made of gold and precious stones, many of the belongings buried with Tutankhamun were well preserved.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kisima haaniyak nowu ohuge sohon geya soyaa gaeneema** (due to no damage to his tomb's discovery) - While the passage mentions the tomb was well-preserved, it doesn't say that's *why* he's famous.
* **B: purana raja laeyisthuwe ohuge thaththwaya** (his lifestyle as an ancient king) - The passage doesn't focus on his life as a king, but rather on the discovery of his tomb.
* **D: purana eejipthu yugaye ohuge vaedgathkama** (his understanding of the ancient Egyptian era) - The passage doesn't discuss his understanding of the era, but his *place* within it.

The passage states: ""...anda kaviyeku woo greeka sahithyaye anargha kruthin dekak woo iliyad saha odisi kavyayan liu homarya."" This translates to ""...and Homer wrote the invaluable works of Greek literature, the Iliad and the Odyssey.""

Therefore, Homer wrote poems (specifically the Iliad and Odyssey).  The best answer from the choices is:

**D: katha kirima** (which means ""told stories"" or ""wrote stories"")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: aeseema** - (doesn't make sense in context)
*   **B: daekeema** - (doesn't make sense in context)
*   **C: aewideema** - (doesn't make sense in context)

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...anda kaviyeku woo greeka sahithyaye anargha kruthin dekak woo iliyad saha odisi kavyayan liu homarya.""  This translates to ""...a poet who wrote invaluable works of Greek literature, namely the *Iliad* and *Odyssey* poems, was Homer.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Sofoklis (Sophocles):** The passage mentions Sophocles as a popular playwright, but not as the author of foundational literary works like the *Iliad* and *Odyssey*.
* **Paithagaras (Pythagoras):** The passage mentions Pythagoras in connection with mathematics (the Pythagorean theorem), not literature.
* **Aeristofnas (Aristophanes):** The passage mentions Aristophanes as a popular playwright, but again, not as the author of the *Iliad* and *Odyssey*.



"

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yudev pavulehi waedi kaalayak gatha vuye **elimahan** parisarayehi ya.""  This directly translates to ""Yudev's footsteps were found in the surrounding **elimahan** areas.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: vithiye (garden):** The passage doesn't mention a garden.
*   **C: midule (middle):** While ""midule"" appears in the text, it refers to a point *within* something, not a location where footprints were found.
*   **D: niwase (residence/house):** The passage mentions a residence, but not as the location where the footsteps were discovered.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Yudev pavulehi waedi kaalayak gatha vuye elimahan parisarayehi ya.""  This translates to ""Those who came with Yudev lived in a large environment/surroundings for a long time.""  It then continues describing the land - its vastness, forests, etc.
* **The question (Q) asks:** ""What did they learn from Yudev's arrival?""
* **The passage implies** they learned about the *qualities of the land* (deshagunaya) because of their long stay there.  The rest of the passage details these qualities.

* **B: owunge alewisael (their guidance/advice):** While there might be guidance implied, the passage focuses on the land itself, not specific advice received.
* **C: owunge niwes (their residence/house):** The passage speaks of a wider environment, not just where they lived.
* **D: owunge iwum pihum (their future generations):** The passage doesn't discuss future generations.

skaendinewiyaanu ratawal athara wenasak lesa wisthara kara nomaeththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: sirith wirith (culture and traditions)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""...denmarkaya, svidanaya, norve saha ayislanthaye janathaava, **rajawarun, sirith virit saha ithihaasaya** athara boho venaskam paewathuni.""  This translates to ""...the people of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland have a lot of connections based on customs, **culture and traditions**, and history.""
* **The question (Q) asks:** What is expanded upon less than history regarding Scandinavian countries? 
* Since the passage specifically highlights culture and traditions *alongside* history, and asks what is *less* detailed, culture and traditions is the most fitting answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ithihasaya (history):**  The passage states there is a lot of connection *based on* history, meaning it *is* detailed.
* **B: bhoomiya (geography):** The passage doesn't focus on the geography of Scandinavia.
* **D: janathawa (people):** The passage mentions the people but focuses on their shared cultural ties.



"
mulinma greenlanthaye padinchi wuye kawuda?,"The correct answer is **A: eskeemo goth‍ra**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Eskimo gothra evitath ema kalaye ehi jivath vemin sitiyo ya."" This translates to ""...It is said that the Eskimo tribe lived there during that time.""  This directly answers the question of who initially inhabited Greenland.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: norwejiyaanuwan:** While the text mentions Scandinavian people (including Norwegians) later, it doesn't say they were the *first* inhabitants.
* **C: rathu erik warun:** Erik the Red is mentioned as someone who traveled *to* Greenland, not the original inhabitants.
* **D: svidan jaathikayan:**  Similar to the Norwegians, Swedes are part of the Scandinavian groups who came *after* the initial inhabitants.

putu nomaethiwa aahara gaeneemata kaemathi wuye mona kandayamada?,"The correct answer is **C: dhanawath romanu pirimin (wealthy Roman citizens)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...duppat minisun saha gahaenun aahara ganu labuwe putuvala indagena wana athara, pohosat minisun kaemaettak daekvuye bhojana sangraha pawathwamin ekata ekva paettata vaetiri aahara gaenimatai.""  This translates to: ""...new discoveries were made about the food consumed by the poor and rich, and exotic foods were consumed by the wealthy citizens at elaborate banquets.""

Therefore, the passage directly links elaborate and exotic food consumption to wealthy Roman citizens.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: dhanawath romanu kaanthawan (wealthy Roman women):** While wealthy women *participated* in banquets, the passage focuses on *who* was consuming the elaborate food, not specifically women.
* **B: duppath romanu pirimin (poor Roman citizens):** The passage contrasts the food of the poor with the elaborate meals of the wealthy.
* **D: duppath romanu kaanthawan (poor Roman women):** Similar to option A, this isn't the primary focus of the text.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...pohosat minisun kaemaettak daekvuye bhojana sangraha pawathwamin ekata ekva paettata vaetiri aahara gaenimatai.""  This translates to ""wealthy people had the ability to collect diverse foods.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: putu wala idagena kaema kana duppath amuththan** (newly discovered foods were often disliked) - While the passage mentions unfamiliar foods, it doesn't focus on dislike.
* **B: golubellan sandaha wu aahara ruchiya** (taste preferences of the wealthy) - The passage mentions specific foods they *didn't* have, not their preferences.
* **D: ros kala kalukun thaetiyak** (the color of old Roman dishes) -  The passage doesn't discuss the appearance of the food.

Therefore, option C is the most directly supported by the information in the provided text."
"chedaya matha padanamwa, kalpawathna balapaemak aethi kala nohaekke pahatha daekwena ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **D: shishtachaara sanskruthiyak (refined culture)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) extensively discusses the rise of *shishtachaara* (refined culture) and its impact on civilization, society, and the development of cities and states. It talks about how it expanded through education, writing, and cultural transmission.  The entire text revolves around the characteristics and evolution of this refined culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: samajayak (society):** While society is *affected* by refined culture, the passage is *about* the culture itself, not just society in general.
* **B: sulu sanskruthiyak (ancient culture):**  The passage contrasts *shishtachaara* with ancient cultures, suggesting it's a development *from* ancient culture, not the central topic.
* **C: nagara-rajyayak (city-state):** City-states are presented as a *result* of the development of *shishtachaara*, not the core subject.

The question asks what the passage primarily describes the origins of, and the passage clearly traces the rise and influence of *shishtachaara sanskruthiyak*.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, jathiyakata purwaga wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: nagara-rajyayak** (city-state).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nagara raajya jaathin yannata purvaga wei.""  This directly translates to ""The city-state came into being before the nation/race.""  

The passage discusses the evolution from ancient civilizations (linked to city-states - *nagaraya ho nagara raajyaya*) to broader cultural and societal structures.  It emphasizes that the nation/race (*jaathi*) developed *after* the city-state.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: shishtachaara sanskruthiyak (refined culture):** While refined culture is discussed, it's not presented as what came *first*.
* **B: ekeeya sanskruthiyak (unified culture):**  Unified culture is a result of the development described, not the initial starting point.
* **D: sulu sanskrutheen (ancient culture):** Ancient culture is a broad term, and the passage specifically points to the city-state as the earlier formation.

This translates to: ""In 1649, after a victory against the Tibetan-Mongol invasion, Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyel had the fortress (balakotuva) built.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eya idikarana ladde tibet-mongoliyaanu hamudawange jayagrahanaya saemareema sandahayi** (It was built to commemorate the victory against the Tibetan-Mongol invasion) - While the fortress *was* built *after* the victory, the passage focuses on *who* built it, not the reason for its construction.
* **B: eya bhoothanaye pihita aetha** (It is a protected site in Bhutan) - The passage mentions its importance and conservation efforts, but it doesn't state this as a primary fact about *why* it's significant.
* **C: ginnakin balakotuwe natabun bohomayak winasha wiya** (Much of the fortress was destroyed in a fire) - This is a fact mentioned in the passage, but it's not the fundamental truth about Drukgyal Dzong.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...subbedrang navang namgyel balakotuva thaenu bhava paewase"" which translates to ""Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the fortress."" and ""...1649 dee, tibet-mongoliyaanu hamudaavalata viruddhava kala satanin thaman lath jayagrahanaya samarima pinisa..."" which indicates it was built *after* a victory.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: tibet-mongoliyaanu hamudawan jayagrahanaya kalaha** (The battle against the Tibetan-Mongolian invasion) - This is *why* it was built, not what it *is*.
* **C: mema aakarshanaye janap‍riyathawayata kisidu balapaemak sidu vi nomaetha** (It didn't contribute to tourism) - The passage explicitly says it's a significant attraction.
* **D: eya sabdrung ngavaeng namjiyel sanrakshanaya kale ya** (It was built to protect Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyel) - The passage doesn't state this; it states he built it.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** clearly states Cambodia repeatedly attacked Vietnam, starting in the 18th century (18th *wana siyavasedi*). It mentions attacks in 1772 destroying Nom Pen (Phnom Penh).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: wiyatnama jaathikayan nom pen winasha kalaha** (Vietnam destroyed Nom Pen) - The passage states Cambodia *destroyed* Nom Pen, not Vietnam.
* **B: 1772 dee kaambojaya thailanthaya aakramanaya kaleya** (Cambodia attacked Thailand in 1772) - The passage focuses on attacks on Vietnam, not Thailand.
* **D: thayiwarun nom pen winasha kalaha** (Thailand destroyed Nom Pen) -  The passage states Cambodia destroyed Nom Pen.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""18 wana siyavase avasan vasara kihipaya thula viyatnaamavarun da kaambojaya arkramena kalaha"" (In the final years of the 18th century, both Vietnam and Cambodia defeated the Cambodian invasion).  It *also* says the invasion occurred around 1772 (""1772 dee nom pen nagaraya vinasha kara daemuvoya"" - destroyed Nom Pen city in 1772 during the invasion).
* **Option B** directly reflects this information - both Thailand (implied by ""thaiwaru"" in the passage relating to the 18 tribes) *and* Vietnam defeated the Cambodian invasion in 1772.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Focuses only on Vietnam, ignoring Thailand's role.
* **C:** Only mentions the destruction of Nom Pen, not the overall defeat of the invasion.
* **D:** Focuses only on Thailand, ignoring Vietnam's role.

Here's why:

The text states: ""1624 dee, landesi naegenahira indiya samaagama, nirithadiga thaiwaanaye sthaapitha woo athara sahal saha seeni vathuyaayan thula waeda kirimata china kamkaruvan yodaa ganimin **swadesika daanya nispaadana kriyaamarga parivaarthaanayakata lak kaleya**."" 

This translates to: ""In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a fort and trading posts in Taiwan and, through Chinese laborers, aimed to **establish a method for domestic grain production**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: diwayine nirithadiga kotase kandawurak pawathva gaeneema (receiving fortifications from the Dutch East India Company):** While the Dutch built forts, the primary aim wasn't *receiving* fortifications, but establishing a presence and production.
*   **C: ehi wathukaraye china kamkaruwan sewaye yedavima (employing Chinese laborers):**  The use of Chinese laborers was a *means* to an end, not the main outcome.
*   **D: thaivanaye palanaya kwin rajawanshayata labaa deemata kaemaeththen (to obtain the governance of Taiwan for the Qing Dynasty):** This relates to a later period (1683) and isn't what the Dutch East India Company was trying to achieve in 1624.



"

Here's why:

The text states: ""1895 dee, palamu china-japan yuddhayen (1894-1895) paraajaya weemen pasu, kwing rajaya shimonoseki sammuthiyata athsan thabana athara emagin ovun thaiwaanaye paalanaya japanayata pavara dene athara...""  This directly translates to: ""In 1895, following the defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War, the Qing Dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, and as a result, they ceded the governance of Taiwan to Japan.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** While the Qing Dynasty *was* weakened, the treaty itself was a *result* of their defeat, not something that established the dynasty.
*   **C:** The text states the Qing Dynasty ceded Taiwan, not gained control of areas.
*   **D:** The treaty resulted in Japan *receiving* authority over Taiwan, not Taiwan becoming part of Japan.



"
rasayanika drawyayaka pH mattama maninu labanne keseda?,"The correct answer is **C: rasayanikaya thula aethi hayid‍rajan ayana p‍ramanaya matha** (whether the chemical contains a certain amount of hydrogen ions).

Here's why:

* **pH measures the concentration of hydrogen ions (H⁺) in a solution.**  A low pH indicates a high concentration of H⁺ (acidic), while a high pH indicates a low concentration of H⁺ (alkaline/basic).  The passage explicitly mentions hydrogen ions (""hayid‍rajan ayana"") and relates them to acidity/basicity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: rasayanikaya ketharam mulika ho aamlika da yanna matha** (whether the chemical is organic or inorganic/acidic) - While acidity is related to pH, being organic or inorganic doesn't *define* pH.  Many organic compounds can be neutral or basic.
* **B: rasayanikaya thula p‍rotona keeyak thibe da yanna matha** (whether the chemical contains protons) - While protons *are* hydrogen ions, simply containing protons doesn't determine pH.  It's the *concentration* of free hydrogen ions that matters.
* **D: rasayanikaya thula ilektrona keeyak thibeda yanna matha** (whether the chemical contains electrons) -  All chemicals contain electrons.  The presence or absence of electrons doesn't determine pH.



Therefore, option C directly addresses how pH is determined – by measuring the amount of hydrogen ions present."
hayidrajan ayana walin iwath karana ladde kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: p‍rotona**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hayiderajan ayana yanu ein electrona ivath woo protona wei"" which translates to ""Hydrogen ions have either electrons or protons.""  The question asks what hydrogen ions do with them.  Therefore, the answer must be protons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pH:** pH is a *measure* of proton concentration, not something hydrogen ions *do*.
* **C: aelkalayin (alkalinity):** Alkalinity relates to bases (opposite of acids) and is a result of chemical reactions involving hydrogen ions, not what the ions themselves *do*.
* **D: ilektrona (electrons):** While the passage mentions electrons *with* protons, the core function of hydrogen ions in acid-base chemistry revolves around the protons.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a close relationship between the ""pirimi"" (pyramid) and the ""gaehaenu"" (house).** It states they are built together, accommodating 1 to 3 families and up to 30 people. They share a common space and have a close familial connection.  The house is essentially integrated *with* the pyramid.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: owun balu raelakata samana widihata haesireyi (They live like children similar to the rays of light)** - While there's mention of light (""raelak""), the main focus isn't a comparison to children.
* **B: pirimi-gaehaenu anupathaya samana nowe (The ratio of the pyramid to the house is not the same)** - The passage doesn't discuss ratios or proportions.
* **D: e dekama maranthika saha samajiyai (This decade is forgetting and society)** - This is irrelevant to the passage's content.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sinha prayids kriya karanne haesirimen pudhuma sahagata lesa sinhayinta samaana vurka ho sunakha raelakata samaana ayurin wana athara (namuth wenath vishaala balalun nove) emenma haesirime dee ovunge godurata itha maaraantika ya."" This translates to: ""The lions often act with companionship before action, living a life similar to their siblings or dogs in terms of strength or lifespan, with about 18 (though not large cubs) and their life expectancy is greatly influenced by their lifestyle.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: owun godak samajasheeleeyi (they are very sociable):** While the passage mentions living in groups, it doesn't emphasize *sociability* as a defining characteristic of their lifestyle.
* **C: pirimi saha gaehaenu yana dewargayama owunge goduruta athishayinma maranthikayi (their life expectancy is greatly affected by the quality of their offspring and home):** The passage states their life expectancy is affected by their *lifestyle*, not specifically offspring or home quality.
* **D: owunge haesireema anekuth wishala balalunta samanayi (their lifestyle is similar to that of many large cubs):** The passage explicitly states they are *not* large cubs (""namuth wenath vishaala balalun nove"").



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage."
haawan yanu saaman‍yayen kumana aakaaraye dadayam sathunge godurak weda?,"The correct answer is **C: madhyama p‍ramanaye balalun** (medium-sized children).

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states: ""madyama pramaanaye balalun ya"" (medium-sized children).  The question (Q) asks about the size of the children being considered for the feeding program.  Therefore, the answer directly comes from the text.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: kuda balalun** (horse children) - This is not mentioned in the text and doesn't make sense in context.
*   **B: wishala balalun** (large children) - The text specifies *medium*-sized children.
*   **D: aentilop** (anteater) - This refers to the anteater mentioned in the beginning of the passage, not the children.



"
kuda balalun saaman‍yayen goduruta ganne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: meeyan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Avasaana washayen krumin, **meeyan**, katussan, saha paksheen waeni kudaa goduru aahaarayata ganna (nidaelle gaevasena suratal balalun aetuluva) kudaa balalun bohomayak atha.""  This directly translates to ""Finally, worms, **fish**, turtles, and birds also eat a lot of nutritious food (even the young ones who are still in their eggshells).""

The question asks which creature primarily eats nutritious food. The passage specifically identifies *meeyan* (fish) as part of that group.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: haawan (wind)** - Wind doesn't eat.
*   **C: aentilop (antelope)** - While mentioned, the passage doesn't highlight them as primary consumers of nutritious food in the same way as fish.
*   **D: muwan (elephant)** - Also mentioned, but not specifically emphasized in relation to nutritious food consumption like fish are.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Vidyagnayan visvaasa karanne amarikaanu balalun aahaaraya sandaha sathun (godura) soyaganne pasupasa hambaa gos ovunge gandhayen bhumiyehi ovun siti sthaanaya iven handunaagaeneemen bavayi.""  This translates to: ""Scientists believe American children, searching for food with their sense of smell (robustly), extensively smell the ground with their noses to find the place where they were."" 

This directly points to the act of smelling extensively at night as a key part of their foraging/finding process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: owunge watapitawa thula saegavi siteema** (their fathers lead them to the site) - The text mentions fathers but doesn't say they *lead* the children to the location. They help with the digging once a spot is chosen.
*   **B: owunge godure suwanda hamba yaama** (they smell their food beautifully) - While they smell for food, the emphasis isn't on the *pleasantness* of the smell, but the thoroughness of the search.
*   **D: kuda p‍ramanaye sathun pamanak godurata gaeneema** (searching for food in proportion to the number of children) - The text doesn't mention the search being proportional to the number of children.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ovunta raathri darshanaya sahitava andure itha hondin as penena athara ithaa rahasin hemin seeruwe aevidimatada haekiya.""  This translates to ""They are known for appearing beautifully at night, or with a mysterious appearance.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: owun rahase hemin seeruwe gaman karai** (they travel in secret) - While the passage hints at secrecy, it doesn't focus on *travel*.
* **C: owunge iwa aelleema durwalayi** (their house locations are weak) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the strength or weakness of their locations.
* **D: owun kuda sathun dadayam kirimata kaemaeththak dakwayi** (they are shown with horses when appearing with food) - The passage mentions food and horses separately, but doesn't link them in this specific way.

* **The passage states:** ""Kotiya sitinne sinhayan, diviyan saha jaguar men ma ekama kandaayamehiya (paentheraa kulaya). garjanaa kireeme haekiyaawa aeththe mema balalun 4 denata pamani.""  This translates to ""The tiger, along with lions, leopards and jaguars, belongs to the same family (Panthera family). It is said that this powerful animal can be heard roaring up to 4 kilometers away.""
* **The question asks:**  What is the tiger's most prominent characteristic related to its power and reach?
* **""Garjanaya"" (roaring)** is directly identified as a powerful feature of the tiger, allowing its presence to be felt over a significant distance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: naegeema (nails):** While tigers have sharp nails, the passage doesn't highlight them as their primary impressive feature.
* **C: paeneema (paws):** Paws are important, but not specifically mentioned in relation to the tiger's reach or power in the text.
* **D: aedeema (body):**  The body is a general feature and doesn't specifically explain how the tiger exerts its power.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, kotin saha sinhayan athara wenasa kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: owunge garjanaye handa** (by the strength of their roar).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Kotiyaage ghoranadaya sinhayekuge purna garjanavak men nova..."" (The intensity of the tiger's roar is not full, but contains the elements of a lion's roar, warning, and encouraging words). This means the key distinguishing factor between tigers and lions is *how they roar*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: owunge pihinum haekiyaawa** (by how they hunt) - The passage doesn't focus on hunting methods as the defining difference.
* **C: owun panina dura** (by the length of their tails) - Tail length isn't mentioned as a key difference.
* **D: owunge aedeeme balaya** (by the strength of their build) - While both are strong, the passage emphasizes the nuance in their roars, not just overall strength.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, robat hook wenath jiwa widyaangayinta pera kale kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: miya giya saila nireekshanaya kirima** (observing the fallen sail).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes observing a sail that fell.** The final sentence explicitly states ""maerunu saila niriksanaya kala palamuvaennaa vuye ohuya"" - ""He seemed to be looking at the fallen sail.""
* **The question asks what happened *after* the robot hook was used.**  The passage implies the robot hook was used to examine something, and that something was the fallen sail.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pranawath jiwiyeku baeleemata anvikshayak bhawitha kirima** (exciting the living being with an investigation of Praanawat) - This is mentioned earlier in the passage but isn't what *followed* the robot hook's use.
* **C: kuda samachathuras‍ra nireekshanaya kirima** (observing the square) - While squares are mentioned, it's not the primary focus of the action after the robot hook.
* **D: jiwiyekuge kudama kriyaakaaree ekaka soyaa gaeneema** (identifying the functional unit of the living being) - This is a broader concept discussed, not the specific action described happening immediately afterward.



Therefore, **A** is the most direct and accurate answer based on the passage."
“sailaya” yana wachanaye mularambhaya yannen adhas karanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: kuda kaamaraya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sailaya yanna paminenne kudaa kamaraya yanna haengavena latin wachanayak wana selaa yanneni.""  This translates to ""The word 'sailaya' originated from the word 'kamaraya' which is a Latin word.""

Therefore, the origin of the word ""sailaya"" is based on ""kamaraya"".



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, boho sathunta kumak kirimata haekiyaawak thibeda?","The correct answer is **B: chalanaya vimata** (movement/motion).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""boho sathunta chalanaya weemata haeki ya."" which translates to ""it is how jellyfish move that makes them different.""  The text then goes on to explain *how* they move - pulsating, swimming in the sea, and floating in the air.  This highlights movement as the defining characteristic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: piyaasara kirimata** (color) - The text doesn't focus on color as a defining feature.
*   **C: pihineemata** (floating) - While they float, it's *how* they move, not the act of floating itself, that differentiates them.
*   **D: haereemata** (eating) - The text mentions their diet, but not how that makes them unique.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, samahara sathunta nomaethi de kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: saila (සෛලය)**.

Here's why:

The passage repeatedly refers to ""sathun"" (creatures) and how they *live in* or are associated with the sea (""samuduruvala pihinamin""). The passage begins by stating ""Sathun, saila boho gananakin saedee atha."" which translates to ""Creatures, many are found in the sea."" Therefore, the common denominator among these creatures is the **sea**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: aahara jirna haekiyaawa (ආහාර ජිරන හැකියායව)** - ""Able to digest food"" - While true of most creatures, this isn't what *defines* them in the passage.
*   **C: molaya (මොළය)** - ""Brain"" - The passage mentions brains briefly as an exception to what defines a ""sathun"" (jellyfish don't have brains), so it's not the common feature.
*   **D: aahara gaeneeme haekiyaawa (ආහාර ගැනීමේ හැකියායව)** - ""Able to take in food"" - Similar to digestion, this is a characteristic of living things generally, not what's specifically highlighted about these creatures in the text.



"
p‍rabhasanshleshanaya atharathura shaka walata upakaara karanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: suryayaa** (sunlight).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shaaka ovunta awashya aahaara hirugen  nipadava ganne **prabhaasanslesanaya tulini.**"" This translates to ""Plants use **photosynthesis** to create their own food from sunlight."" 

Therefore, photosynthesis *requires* sunlight. The other options are results *of* the process or things the plants use *with* photosynthesis, but not the driving force behind it.

*   **Sewana (A):** Water is *used* in photosynthesis, but isn't the source of energy.
*   **Sathun (B):** Food is *created* by photosynthesis.
*   **Aahara (C):** Food is *created* by photosynthesis.



"
shaka aashvasa karana minisun p‍rashvasa karanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: kaaban dayoksayid** (carbon dioxide).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shaaka magin minisun aasvasa karana oxygen nipadawana athara, eva minisun praasvasa karana (enam, pita karana) carbon daioxaide avasosanaya karayi.""  This translates to: ""Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in, and humans exhale (breathe out) carbon dioxide as a result.""

Therefore, plants take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide which is what humans breathe *out*.

"mema chedayata anuwa, parinamaye kriyaawaliyata badhaa karanne pahatha daekwena udaharanawalin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: nawa parisarayak thula anuwarthanaya vimata haeda gaeswena gahanayak** (a leader who gets caught while trying to adapt to the new environment).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where leaders (gahanayak) struggle to adapt to a rapidly changing environment (nawa parisarayata).** They try different strategies but fail to maintain control, eventually becoming overwhelmed. They are ""caught"" or ""trapped"" by the changes.
* **Option C directly reflects this struggle and the consequence of being unable to adapt.**  It highlights a leader who is *caught* (haeda gaeswena) while *trying to adapt* (anuwarthanaya vimata) to the *new environment* (nawa parisarayak).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kuda kandayamakata nawa sthaanayaka samruddhimath vimata apohosath vima** (a place where a leader finds success as a new position) - This is the opposite of what the passage describes – the leaders *fail* not succeed.
* **B: ek gahanayakin kotasak nawa parisarayakata wen vi yaama** (a leader who wastes time in a new environment) - While the leaders might be seen as ineffective, the passage focuses on their *inability to adapt* rather than simply wasting time.
* **D: eka janagahanayak awasanaye dekak bawata path vima** (a leader who falls at the end of the road) -  This is a vague consequence. The passage is specific about the *reason* for their downfall - the inability to adapt.



Therefore, **C** is the best answer because it encapsulates the core theme of the passage – the plight of leaders struggling with rapid environmental change and failing to adapt."
wisheshap‍rapthiya nam kriyaawaliya niwaerediwa wisthara nokaranne pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashawalin kawareda? ,"The correct answer is **C: eya nawa wishesha jananayak aethivima gaena sandahan karai** (It reveals the evidence by considering it as a new creation).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on a new understanding or ""special achievement"" (wisheshaprapthiya) arising from a complex process of investigation and observation.** The passage describes how this understanding isn’t a simple discovery of something already existing, but rather a *generation* of new knowledge.  The final sentences emphasize that this achievement isn't a single element, but something derived from this generative process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: nawa gahanayakata anuwarthanaya vimata nohaeki wu wita eya sidu we** (It is achieved by something that does not follow the new investigation) - This is contradictory to the passage. The achievement *is* a result of the new investigation.
* **B: meya parinameeya kriyaawaliye p‍radhaana angayaki** (It is a main part of this consequential process) - While true to a degree, it doesn't capture the essence of *how* the achievement is revealed – through creating something new from the investigation.
* **D: eya siduvima vaelaekwiya nohaeki ya** (It is not something that can be achieved quickly) - This relates to the *time* it takes, not *how* the achievement is understood or revealed.



The passage highlights that ""wisheshaprapthiya"" is presented as a new creation, a result of actively *generating* understanding, rather than passively *finding* it.  Therefore, option C best reflects that core concept."
hardaya wasthuwa desata rudhiraya gena enne rudhira sansarana paddhathiye kumana kotasada?,"The correct answer is **A: dhamani**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dhamani namin haedinvena naala harahaa rudhiraya hrda vastuven ivathata galaa yana athara..."" (Meaning: Arteries are the vessels that carry blood *to* the heart...)
* The question asks which part of the circulatory system carries blood *to* the heart.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: kesha naalika (capillaries):** These are very small vessels where exchange happens between blood and tissues, not directly to the heart.
* **C: awayawa (organs):** Organs *receive* blood, they don't carry it to the heart.
* **D: shiraa (veins):**  The passage states veins carry blood *from* areas *to* the heart (...""shiraa namin haedinvena naala haraha naewatha hrdaya wetha rudhiraya paemine..."") but the question asks about blood going *to* the heart.



"
rudhira sansarana paddhathiye kudama nala monavada?,"The correct answer is **A: kesha naalika**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""kudaama naala kesha naalika lesa haedin we"" - which translates to ""capillary vessels are like hair threads"".  This directly identifies *kesha naalika* (capillaries) as the smallest blood vessels in the circulatory system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: dhamani (arteries):** The passage describes arteries *carrying* blood *to* the heart.
* **C: shiraa (veins):** The passage describes veins *carrying* blood *from* the heart.
* **D: awayawa (organs):** While organs are part of the circulatory system, they aren't the specific type of vessel being asked about.



"
krumiyekuta piyaapath pitupasata naemeeme haekiyaawa vaedi wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawarakda?,"The correct answer is **A: aahara saepayuma (food supply)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states that the first symptom of worms is loss of appetite, followed by wasting away (becoming thin) despite eating, and then being unable to digest food properly. This directly points to a problem with the *food supply* – the worms are interfering with the body's ability to get nourishment from food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: saegavime paraasa (digestive parasites):** While worms *are* parasites, the question asks about the *initial* symptom when they are present, not the worms themselves.
*   **C: sahakaruvan soyaa gaeneema (working efficiently):** The passage states the opposite – they become *less* efficient at working (digesting food).
*   **D: piyaasara kirime wegaya (thirst quenching speed):** The passage mentions thirst, but it's a consequence of the wasting away, not the first sign of worms.



"

Here's why:

The passage states that the worms ""consume food and efficiently work towards reproduction"". It also mentions they become weak if they don't get enough to eat, impacting their ability to move and reproduce.  The passage directly links the worms' ability to *get* food (piyasara kirimata aethi haekiyaawa) to their reproduction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: prajananaya (reproduction):** While reproduction is *affected* by food intake, the question asks what *happens* when they *get* food.
* **B: aayu kaalaya (lifespan):** The passage doesn't primarily focus on how long they live, but *how* they live and reproduce.
* **D: kaaryak‍shamathawa (efficiency/capability):** Efficiency is a *result* of having enough food, not what they initially seek.



Therefore, the worms prioritize getting food because it's crucial for their diet and ultimately, their ability to reproduce."
pahatha daekwena lakshana walin saaman‍yayen dayinosarayan samaga sambandha nowanne kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: pasupasa kakul walin aewideema** (identified by their scaly skin).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Ovunta korapotu saha niya sahitha paa thibe, ovun bittara damana athara tee rex keneku men siya pasupasa kakul deken aevidi.""  This translates to: ""They had scales and claws, and even T-Rex had scaly skin.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pihatu (feathers):** The passage doesn't mention feathers.
* **C: bittara daemeema (being large in size):** While some dinosaurs were large, the passage doesn't specifically identify size as a defining characteristic.
* **D: niyapothu sahitha paa (having teeth):** While dinosaurs had teeth, it's not presented as *the* key identifying feature in the passage.



"
kurullange ha dayinosorayange podu lakshanayak lesa nosaelakenne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The passage describes dinosaurs as having feathers, scales, and claws. It specifically mentions T-Rex having small arms with powerful claws. 

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: biththara daemeema (being covered in hair)** - The passage doesn't mention hair.
* **B: aewideemata pasupasa kakul deka bhawitha kirima (having powerful claws on small arms)** - This is *directly* stated in the passage regarding the T-Rex.
* **C: piyaasara kirimata aethi haekiyaawa (being able to fly)** - The passage doesn't mention flight. It says they are called ""birds"" but that's a comparison, not a statement about their ability to fly.
* **D: niyapothu sahitha paa (having feet with nails)** - This is a general characteristic of many animals, but not a specific distinguishing feature highlighted in the text about dinosaurs.

Therefore, the best answer is **B: aewideemata pasupasa kakul deka bhawitha kirima (having powerful claws on small arms)**.

"mema chedayata anuwa, sayikaed shakaye kumana kotasa traisaratopsge hata aaharayata gatha haekida?","The correct answer is **A: katu sahitha kola** (leaves with thorns).

The passage explicitly states: ""mema shaaka tiyunu, **katu sahitha kola** valin yuth agissak aethi kudaa thal gasak men pene."" (This plant, it seems, could grow tall enough for young armored individuals to reach, **with thorny leaves**).  It also describes the *Triceratops* being able to demolish strong stems to reach these leaves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: kanda** (fruit) - The passage doesn't mention fruit.
*   **C: mula** (roots) - The passage states they would break stems to *reach* the leaves, implying the food source isn't underground.
*   **D: gedi** (grass) - While *Triceratops* likely ate some low-lying vegetation, the passage focuses on a taller, thorn-covered plant they actively sought out.

"mema chedayata anuwa, traisaratops anubhawa kirimata boho durata ida aeththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda? ","The correct answer is **B: daedi athu sahitha shakayak** (plants with hard stems/branches).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Samahara vidyagnayan anumaana karanne traisaratops anubhava kale kritesiyas yugaye bahula shaakayak woo sayikaeds bavayi."" (Many scientists believe that Triceratops fed on abundant vegetation during the Cretaceous period). It then goes on to describe the type of vegetation - tough plants, potentially with spikes, and difficult to chew.  It explicitly mentions ""katu sahitha kola valin yuth agissak aethi kudaa thal gasak men pene"" (they could potentially tear down trees with hard stems).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sloth** - Sloths are mentioned as *being eaten* by something, not *what* Triceratops ate.
*   **C: giravek** - Giraves (giraffes) are also mentioned as potentially being prey, not food.
*   **D: wisha sahitha gedi aethi shaakayak** -  While the passage mentions poisonous plants, it doesn’t specify that these were the primary food source. The focus is on the toughness of the plants.



Therefore, **daedi athu sahitha shakayak** (plants with hard stems/branches) is the most accurate answer, as it aligns with the description of the Triceratops’s likely diet in the passage."

This directly translates to ""Italy national football team, Germany national football team, and the low countries' most successful team were the ones at the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals.""
* **The question asks:** About a popular sport in the northern provinces of Italy.
* **The passage also mentions:** Italy is popular for team sports and winter sports. However, the initial sentence firmly establishes *football* (paapandu) as a key national sport linked to a major event (the FIFA World Cup).

Therefore, football is the most logical answer, as the passage directly links it to Italy's national identity and popularity.

This translates to: ""Italy national football team, Germany national football team, along with the most successful team in the world, the FIFA World Cup final was held in 2006.""

The question asks which sport is prominently mentioned in connection with Italy and the world championship.  Football (paapandu) is the clear answer.

Therefore, the Belgian Revolution is the event that led to Luxembourg ceding territory to Belgium.

This translates to: ""Luxembourg, always wanting to maintain its neutrality, was occupied by Germany during the First and Second World Wars.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: yuropa sangamayata ekvima** (Joining the European Union) -  While Luxembourg joined the European Union, the passage states this happened *after* periods of being affected by war, not *caused* its loss of neutrality.
* **C: beljiyaanu viplavaya** (Belgian Revolution) -  The passage mentions the Belgian Revolution as a historical event related to Luxembourg's past, but it doesn't say it caused Luxembourg to lose its neutrality.
* **D: svadheena ratak bawata pathvima** (Becoming an independent state) - Luxembourg *was* an independent state, this wasn't a cause of losing neutrality.

This translates to: ""Considering a similar average, Turkey's land area is approximately 1,600 kilometers long (approximately 1,000) and approximately 800 kilometers wide (approximately 500).""

The question asks for Turkey's *saethapum* (approximately) length, which is given as **1,000**.

This translates to: ""Many of the state's laws are enacted in Italian or Latin, **especially during religious festivals**.""

Therefore, Latin is used during religious festivals in Vatican City.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: edineda sanniwedanaya (legal notifications):** While Italian or Latin *may* be used for legal notifications, the text doesn't specifically state Latin is used *especially* for them.
*   **C: vyavasthaa sampadanaya (system management):**  The text mentions system management is done in Italian, not specifically Latin.
*   **D: nila sanniwedanaya (blue notifications):** This doesn't make sense in the context of the passage.



"
wathikaanu nagaraye ithali bhashawa bhawitha nokaranne kumak sandahada?,"The correct answer is **C: aagamika uthsawa (religious festivals)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...athara latin bhaashava nitharama aagamika uthsavavaladi bhaavitha kere"" which translates to ""...and especially holds religious festivals in Italian or Latin."" This directly links Italian language use to religious festivals in Vatican City.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: vyavasthaa sampadanaya (administration)** - The text says administration *is done* in Italian, not that it's *why* Italian is used.
*   **B: nila sanniwedanaya (blue reports/announcements)** - The text says announcements *are made* in Italian, not that it’s the reason Italian is used.
*   **D: edineda sanniwedanaya (daily announcements)** - Similar to B, this is something *done* in Italian, not the fundamental reason.

"mema chedayata anuwa, navina pariganakawala shabda mishra kirimen p‍rathilabha mevayin kawareda ?","The correct answer is **A: sangeethaya (music)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states that complex computer creations ""boho vita sangitaya patigata kere"" - meaning they often lead to a lot of music. It describes how computers are used for painting and video, but ultimately connects the complex creations to *music*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: sajivikaranaya (animation):** While the passage mentions animation, it doesn't say complex creations *result* in animation.
* **C: pinthura (painting):**  Painting is *used by* computers, but it's not the final result of the complex process described.
* **D: idikirim (video):**  Similar to painting, video is a tool used, not the outcome of the complex mixture.



Therefore, **music (sangeethaya)** is the best answer based on the passage."

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Harappa saha mohenjo-daaro yana nagaravala saema nivasakama paahe navina malapavaahana paddhatiyakata sambandhitha jalayen sodaa harina vaesikili paddhatiyak savi kara tibuni.""  This translates to: ""In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, residents first devised sophisticated systems related to new transportation methods, particularly drainage systems.""

The question asks where residents *first* devised these systems. The passage directly identifies Mohenjo-daro (and Harappa) as the location.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: parsiyaawa (Persia):** The passage mentions Persia having sophisticated systems, but *not* as the origin point.
*   **C: saentorini:** The passage mentions Santorini in relation to transportation methods, but it doesn't indicate they *first* devised the drainage systems there.
*   **D: chinaya (China):**  Similar to Persia, China is mentioned with sophisticated systems, but not as the initial developers.



"

The passage specifically mentions Santorini as a place where transportation systems were discovered. The other options are mentioned as places where *water management* systems were found (Harappa, Egypt, Persia, China), or simply as locations where Roman infrastructure existed (though not necessarily relating to transportation).



"

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the curves and shapes of the head in the sketch.** It repeatedly describes how the head is drawn with curves (""pathula madak wakra wee""), how the lines flow, and how touching the sketch feels curved.  The entire description centers around this visual element.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: sket thalaya dige diwena dwitathwa dara** (the sketch shows duality in the length of the head) -  The passage doesn't discuss length or duality.
* **C: sket karannage samastha kusalatha mattama** (the overall skill of the sketcher) - The passage doesn't assess the artist's skill, only *what* is drawn.
* **D: ayiswala gunathmakabhawaya** (the qualitative nature of the Ayis) - While the Ayis is mentioned, the focus is on the *sketch* of the Ayis, not her qualities.



Therefore, option A is the most directly supported by the text's detailed description of the head's curved form in the sketch."

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a curved or bent shape.** The phrases ""patula madak wakra wee aethi baevin"" (curves and bends are present) and ""daaraya da wakra ve"" (the touch also curves) clearly indicate a curved form.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: dara dekakin yuthuyi (දාරා දෙකකින් යුත්):**  Means ""with two sides/edges."" The passage doesn't focus on having two sides.
    * **C: awathalawa aetha (අවටාළාව ඇත):** Means ""there is a depression/hollow."" While a curve *can* create a hollow, the passage describes the shape *of* the curve, not a hollow within it.
    * **D: aelavi aetha (ඇලවී ඇත):** Means ""is attached/stuck.""  The passage is about the *form* of the sketch, not whether it's adhered to something.

**Therefore, ""wakrayi"" (curved) is the best description of the sketch based on the text.**

This directly links the described action of releasing extra energy from atoms via light to the process of ""radiation excitation release.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: wikirana (radiation):** While radiation is *part* of the process, it doesn't describe the full action of releasing energy through light.
* **B: fotona wimochanaya uththejanaya kirima (photon release excitation):** This describes *what* happens (photons are released), but not the overall process name.
* **C: fotona (photons):** Photons are the *result* of the process, not the process itself.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate and complete answer based on the provided text."
paramanuwak fotonayak wimochanaya kirimata hethu wanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: athiriktha shakthiya muktha kirima** (releasing excess energy).

Here's why, based on the provided text:

The text states: ""Evaaye pera shakti mattamata aapasu yaamata, eva aalokayen labaagat athireka shakthiyen nidahas viya yuthu ya.""  This translates to something like: ""When an atom receives energy, it releases excess energy as light.""

The rest of the passage elaborates *how* this happens (excitation, photons, etc.), but the fundamental *reason* atoms release photons is due to having excess energy they need to get rid of.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: deepthimath aalokaya nisa aethiwana uththejanaya** (excitation caused by intense light) -  While intense light *can* cause excitation, it's not the fundamental reason for photon emission.  Emission happens regardless of how the atom gained the energy initially.
*   **C: asthaayee shakthi mattam** (temporary energy level) - This describes *where* the energy is, not *why* it's released.
*   **D: wikirana walata ahithakara p‍rathikriyaawak** (harmful reactions to radiation) - This is unrelated to the basic process of photon emission.

* **The passage states (P):** ""aaloka savikuruva sandaha wana svichaya kriyaa virahitha kirimata ho raehaena visandhi kirimata awashya we.""  This translates to: ""It is necessary to understand that the situation where there is no action taken regarding switching on light bulbs is a problematic situation."" It directly identifies the *lack of action* regarding light bulbs as a problem.
* **Option A** translates to ""not taking action to switch on light bulbs.""  This aligns directly with the passage's statement about the lack of action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** Focuses on a specific action (pressing a metal button) and isn't the *reason* for the overall lack of action.
* **C:** Refers to the initial description of the bulbs, not the reason for inaction.
* **D:** Describes a possible outcome (electricity flowing), not the root cause of the problem.

*   ""...oba visin sokattuve aetulata ho balbaye loha padanama aelluvahoth..."" - ""...if you touch the socket even with a metal pad, you might get a strong electric shock...""
*   ""...sokattuve ardha washayen paewathiya dee..."" - ""...even half-way through the socket...""

The question (Q) asks what is a dangerous thing to touch when installing a bulb.  The passage clearly indicates touching the **metal pad (balbaye padanama)** of the socket is dangerous and can cause a shock.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: suthrikaa (screwdriver):** While tools are used, the passage specifically warns against metal contact with the socket.
*   **B: balbaye switachaya (bulb switch):** The passage doesn't focus on the switch itself as the primary danger.
*   **D: kebalaya (cable):** While cables can be dangerous, the immediate risk described is touching the socket's metal pad.



"
mema chedayata anuwa n‍yashtiyak bedeemen siduwanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: protona labaa gaene** (gains protons).

Here's why:

The passage describes a process where a nucleus breaks down, emitting energy and particles (protons and neutrons). This breakdown leads to a change in the nucleus, specifically gaining protons.  The phrase ""boho protona saha newtrona samaga nyashtiyak ek kireemen aethi wana shakthiye mooladharmaya matha"" translates to something like ""the fundamental principle of releasing energy when a nucleus breaks down with many protons and neutrons.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: shakthiya muda harinu laebe** (loses energy) - While energy *is* released, it's not the fundamental *change* happening *to* the nucleus. Energy release is a consequence of the nuclear change.
* **C: paramanu asthaayee we** (the atom becomes unstable) - The atom *becomes* unstable *because* of the nuclear change, but instability isn't the direct result of the breakdown. The breakdown *causes* the instability.
* **D: niytrona naethi vi yayi** (neutrons disappear) - Neutrons are emitted, but the core change is the addition of protons, which alters the atomic number and changes the element.



"
digu dura aemathum pruthiwiyata wetha pahalata parawarthanaya wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: duradkna**.

Here's why:

The passage describes ""duradakna"" (a distant vision/image) being created by the Earth's atmosphere distorting light and sight. It specifically states the atmosphere *makes* this ""duradakna"" appear.  The question asks what is being reflected/transformed when looking far into the distance. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: chandrikaa** - Chandrikaa refers to the moon or moonlight, and while mentioned in the passage, it's not *what* is being reflected, but something *affected* by the atmospheric distortion.
*   **C: widuli pahan** -  ""Widuli pahan"" means electric light. The passage talks about natural light and the atmosphere's effect on it.
*   **D: rokattu** - ""Rokattu"" means color, and while colors *are* part of what we see, the passage is about the formation of an image *itself*, not just the colors within it.



"
duradknayak abhyawakaashaye raendavimata bhawitha karanne mevayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **D: adi 100 ta wada usa chandrikaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Abyavakaasaye chandrikaavak ho duradaknayak raedhaweemata adi 100 kata vadaa usa yodha rokattuvak awashya wei.""  This directly translates to ""The void made the moonlight a distant sight, requiring a warrior to overcome 100 obstacles.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly states that **100 obstacles and the moonlight** make the distant sight (duradaknayak) for the void (abyavakaasaye).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: aaloka kadambha (light cluster):** While light is mentioned, it's the *moonlight* specifically and the obstacles related to it, not just any light cluster, that are making the sight distant.
*   **B: rokattu (obstacles):** Obstacles are *part* of the reason, but not the complete answer. It’s the moonlight *and* the obstacles.
*   **C: pruthiwi vayugolaya (Earth's atmosphere):** The Earth's atmosphere is mentioned as distorting vision, but doesn't directly make the sight distant *for the void*.



"
kaalaya gevi yaama nireekshanaya kirima sandaha chak‍reeya siduvimak gaena sandahan kala yuththe kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: punarawarthanaya (repetition/recurrence)**.

Here's why:

The passage heavily emphasizes the cyclical nature of time (""Chakreeya siduweemaka punaraavartanaya"" - cyclical repetitions). It states that observing these repetitions helps understand the vastness of time and how past, present, and future are interconnected.  The question asks what is observed when examining time through a cyclical lens.  Therefore, the answer is the *recurrence* or *repetition* that defines those cycles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kaala seemawa (time limits/boundaries):** While the passage mentions time limits, it's not the *observation* made when looking at cyclical time, but rather a consequence of how we perceive it.
* **C: balapaema (strength/power):** This refers to time's influence on everything we do but isn't what's directly observed in cyclical patterns.
* **D: dushkarathawaya (difficulty):**  The passage doesn't focus on the difficulty of understanding time; it's about *how* to understand it.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, yam siduvimaka kumana angaya sansandanaya kirimata kaalaya bhawitha weda?","The correct answer is **A: diga**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""kaalaya, apa siddhinvala **kaala seemaawa (diga)** sansandanaya karana aakaraya da wei.""  This translates to ""Time, is a factor that defines our achievements within a **time limit (duration)**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: punarawarthanaya (repetition/cycle)** - While the passage *mentions* cyclical nature, it doesn't say that time *defines* achievements through repetition.
* **C: athdaekeem (future)** - Time encompasses past, present and future, it doesn't define achievements solely through the future.
* **D: balapaema (power/strength)** - Time provides a context for achievements, but doesn't *define* them through power.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, sinhasanaye urumakkaarayakuge saaman‍ya lakshanaya lesa salakanu labanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: 2:2 upadhiyak labaa gaeneema** (received a 2:2 degree).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the individual ""labā ganimin ithihaasaya ugatteya"" (received a history degree) *and* ""2:2 k (devana pela pahala panthiye upaadhiyak)"" (a 2:2 degree - second class honors, division two).  The question asks for a *common characteristic* of those who inherited the throne.  The passage points to the 2:2 degree as a defining trait of this particular individual.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: hamudawata baendeemata wishwa widyaalayen iwath vima** (attended university before inheriting) - While true, this isn't *unique* or a defining characteristic; many people attend university.
* **C: ithihasaya igeneema** (studied history) - Again, true, but not unique to throne inheritance.
* **D: hamudawata baendeemata pera wishwa widyaalayata yaama** (went to university after inheriting) - The passage states they attended *before* inheriting.



Therefore, the 2:2 degree is the most specific and noteworthy characteristic mentioned in relation to this potential heir."
"mema chedaye dakva aethi thorathuru matha padanamwa, chaals mulinma kale kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: pasala awasan kirimata pera hamudawata baendeema** (started teaching at a school after completing studies).

Here's why:

The passage states ""Saampradhaayikawa, kirulata urumakaruvaa paasal adyaapanaya nima kireemen anaturuva kelinma yudha hamudaavata yaa yutuya.""  This translates to ""The individual started teaching at a school after completing their studies."" This is the most direct and accurate reflection of the initial action described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pura widyaawa igeneema** (studied ancient history) - While the passage *mentions* studying humanities and ancient history, it's not the primary action described at the beginning.
* **C: upadhiyak labaa gaeneema** (obtained a degree) -  The passage states they *received* a 2:2 degree, but the focus isn't solely on getting the degree itself.
* **D: triniti koleg ekata yaama** (went to Trinity College) -  This is where they *studied*, but not the primary action the question is asking about.



"
trayigvasan balaaeniya paewatha enne kumana ratenda?,"The correct answer is **D: norwe**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...oolaф trigvцsan nam norvejiyanu jaatikayaya."" which translates to ""...Olaf Trigvason was a Norwegian.""  This directly links Olaf Trigvason and his forces to Norway. The question asks which country Olaf's forces came from, so Norway is the answer.



"
germaniya esthoniyaawata p‍rabala sanskruthika balapaemak aethi kale ithihasaye kumana wakavanuwedee da?,"The correct answer is **B: meeta wasara 400 kata pamana pera** (approximately 400 words).

**Reasoning:**

The passage (P) discusses a significant cultural influence of Germany on Estonia, specifically related to the development of the Estonian written language. It mentions:

*   German scholars assisting in bringing Estonian closer to its native form.
*   Germans creating the Estonian written language.
*   The influence being so strong that older Estonian texts often contained the diacritic ""O/o"".
*   A substantial amount of vocabulary in Estonian originating from German.
*   The influence stemming from a long period of time.

To comprehensively explain this historical cultural impact, a response of around 400 words would be necessary to elaborate on the specifics of this influence, the time period involved, the role of German scholars and the adoption of German vocabulary into Estonian. 200 words is insufficient to cover these points adequately, while 600 and 800 words might be excessive for a direct response to the question.



"
estoniyaanu bhashawa kerehi balapaem kale kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: Õ/õ akura**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Eya germanu hodiya matha padanam woo athara ek akurak """"O/o"""" ek kerini.""  This translates to ""It created a character like 'O/o' instead of German letters.""  The passage is specifically talking about a unique character used in the Estonian written language, derived from the German 'O'.  The ""Õ/õ"" is the Estonian letter described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: germanu hodiya (German letters):** The passage states the Estonian language *avoided* using German letters, creating something *instead* of them.
*   **C: germanu pujakawaru (German worshippers):** The passage discusses language creation, not religious practices.
*   **D: dewiyan (gods):**  The passage mentions deities in relation to German heritage but doesn't state they were involved in language creation.

"mema chedayata anuwa, swadesheeya hindi kathikayinge sankhyaawa uchchaawachanaya wanne kumana sadhakaya mathada?","The correct answer is **A: hindi bhashawata behewin samana upabhasha ganan ganu labanne nam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Svadesiya kathikayinge sankhyaava vadaat sameepawa adaala vana samaana upabhaasha gananaya karanne da naethi da yanna padanamwa venas we.""  This translates to: ""It is not possible to accurately estimate the number of native Hindi speakers because of the large number of similar dialects.""

* **Option A** directly reflects this statement – it says you *cannot* get a count of dialects related to Hindi.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage mentions Urdu, but not as a reason for difficulty in counting Hindi speakers. It simply notes the similarities between the scripts.
* **C & D:** The passage doesn’t focus on the *understanding* or *knowing* of individuals, but the *counting* of dialects and speakers. The problem is the variety of dialects, not people understanding/knowing the language.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hindi saha urdu wachanamalawe samaana wana namuth akuru venas wei; edineda sanvada thula, bhasha dekema kathaa karannanta saamanyayen ekineka therum gatha haeka.""  This translates to: ""Hindi and Urdu have similar scripts and pronunciations; therefore, in conversation, people often understand each other when speaking.""

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: saaman‍yayen bhasha dekehima kathikayan athara thorum gaeneeme nohaekiyaawak pawathee** (Generally, it is not possible to understand stories or words in the language) - This contradicts the passage.
* **B: ewaye akuru wenas ya** (Is its script different?) - The passage states the scripts are *similar*.
* **D: ewa wachana malawe wenas we** (It does not have a script) - This is clearly false, as both Hindi and Urdu have scripts.

Therefore, **C** is the only answer that accurately reflects the information provided in the passage.



"
haengeyal hodiya pilibanda niwaeredi karunak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: hodiye mul nama hunan jiyonjiyam wiya** (This means ""The origin of the alphabet is Hunmin Jeongeum"").

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Hangeyul yanu janapriya dainika bhavithaya sandaha ma soyaagat hodiyaki. hodiya soyaaganu labuwe 1444 sejong raaja kaalayedi... Hangel hodiya ohu mulin nam kale hunmin jonjiyam yanuveni.""  This translates to ""The passage mentions the origin of the Hangul alphabet. This alphabet was created in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong... King Sejong named its origin Hunmin Jeongeum.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eya sejon rajuge palana samaye aarambhaye dee nirmanaya karana ladee** (This means ""It was built during the reign of King Sejong"") - While true, it doesn't answer *what* was built, just *when*.  The question asks about the origin, not the timing.
* **C: eya soyaa ganna ladde joson rajawanshaye siwwana raju wisini** (This means ""It was created by the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty"") - While King Sejong was a Joseon Dynasty king, the passage specifies *he* created it and *named* it.  It doesn't describe his position in the dynasty.
* **D: meya hithamathama nirmanaya karana laddki** (This means ""This was built for better construction"") - This is irrelevant to the passage and doesn't relate to the origin of Hangul.



"
hanmin jiyonjiyam hodiya awasanayedee wenas karana ladde kumak sandahada?,"The correct answer is **A: sejon**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sejong raju josoyon vanshaye hatara veni raju woo athara, ithaama agaya kerenavun atharin keneki. Hangel hodiya ohu mulin nam kale hunmin jonjiyam yanuveni.""  This translates to: ""King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty, the eighth son, and created the Hunminjeongeum.

Therefore, King Sejong is credited with creating the Hunminjeongeum. The question asks *who* was responsible for it.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, sanskrutha bhashawa balapaem kara aeththe kumana bhashawatada?","The correct answer is **A: Latin bhasha (Latin language)**.

Here's why, based on the provided text:

The text explicitly states: ""Sanskrutha yanu paerani bhashavak wana athara eya yuropaye kathaa karana latin bhashavata samaana kala haeki ya.""  This translates to ""And among the ancient languages, it (Sanskrit) is similar in quality to the Latin language spoken in Europe.""

The text further links Sanskrit to the roots of European languages *through* Latin: ""Pransha saha spaangna waeni yuropiya bhaashaavalata mulaashraya woo latin bhaashava lesama, navina indiyanu bhasha bohomayakata mulashraya saepayu sanskrutha..."" (French and Spanish, like European languages, have Latin as their base, and many new Indian languages also have Sanskrit as their base).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Yuropeeya bhasha (European languages):** While Sanskrit *influenced* some European languages, it wasn't directly equivalent to all of them. The connection is *through* Latin.
*   **C: Purana bhasha (Ancient languages):** This is too broad. Sanskrit is an ancient language, but the question asks for the language it's *most* similar to.
*   **D: Indiya bhasha (Indian languages):**  While Sanskrit is an Indian language and a root for many, the passage specifically highlights its relationship with Latin.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, sanskrutha bhasha bhawithaya kemen naethi vi giye kumak nisada?","The correct answer is **A: sankeernathwaya (complexity)**.

Here's why:

The passage repeatedly emphasizes that Sanskrit is a *complex* and *sophisticated* language (""ithama sankirna saha pohosat bhashavaki"").  The entire text details its intricate history, influence on other languages, and rich literary tradition.  The question asks *how* Sanskrit came to be, and the passage's core message is its inherent complexity developed over time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: aaryayange sank‍ramanaya (Aryan migration):** While the passage *mentions* the Aryan migration as part of Sanskrit's history, it doesn’t explain *how* the language developed. It's a historical factor, not the reason for its nature.
* **C: lathin bhasha (Latin language):**  The passage points out similarities between Sanskrit and Latin, but doesn’t say Latin *caused* Sanskrit to be the way it is.
* **D: dhoorawaliya (distant past):**  While Sanskrit *has* a distant past, that doesn't explain its characteristics.  The question is about *how* the language is, not *when* it existed.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, ayo hi guruthvakarshanaya sambandhayen niwaeredi p‍rakaashayak wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The question asks what conclusion can be drawn from the given text regarding gravity. Let's break down the text:

* **The text describes a scenario:** Someone (let's call them 'you') is experiencing a different gravitational pull than Earth's.
* **Mass and Weight are compared:** Your mass is 200k (roughly 90kg), but your weight is 36k (roughly 16kg). This drastically reduced weight indicates a *much* weaker gravitational force.
* **Key Statement:** The text explicitly states ""even then, gravity doesn't affect you much.""

Now let's analyze the options:

* **A: ayoge guruthvakarshanayata wada pruthiwiye guruthvakarshanaya obata aeda noganee (Your gravity is stronger than Earth's, and it doesn't affect you much.)** -  This is incorrect. The text implies the opposite; *your* gravity isn't strong enough to affect you much.
* **B: ayoge guruthvakarshanaya vaediyen aeda ganee, e nisa obe bara adu wanu aetha (Your gravity is weaker, which is why your weight is less.)** - This is a plausible explanation, aligning with the reduced weight.
* **C: ayoge guruthvakarshanaya vaediyen aeda ganee, e nisa obe bara vaedu wanu aetha (Your gravity is weaker, which is why your weight increases.)** -  Incorrect. Weaker gravity means *less* weight, not more.
* **D: pruthiwiye guruthvakarshanaya ayo hi guruthvakarshanayata wada obawa aeda ganu aetha (Earth's gravity is stronger than your gravity.)** - This is a possible interpretation, but the key takeaway is that *your* gravity isn't strong enough to have a significant effect, not just a comparison to Earth.

Therefore, the best answer is **B**. It directly explains the relationship between weaker gravity and reduced weight, which is the central idea presented in the text.



**Final Answer: B**"

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sandehi thaenithala pradeshaya yata eya thuni wana athara us bim yata gana we."" (It is suspected that it fell into an area near the warm land.) This directly implies the surface is close to warm land.
* **Option B** translates to: ""The surface is close to warm land.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aasanna paeththata wada ghana prushtayak aetha** - While the passage mentions a dense surface near the landing spot, it doesn't *explain* what the surface is.
* **C: aetha paeththe adu udam raela aethi wiya haekiya** - This focuses on the upward flow of heat, a detail mentioned but not the primary explanation for the surface's location.
* **D: usbim walata pahalin udam raela adu wiya haekiya** - This mixes the information about upward heat flow with the location near warm land, and is not the direct answer to the question.



"
mema chedayata anuwa chandrayaage prushtaya wadath ghana wanne kothaenada?,"The correct answer is **B: udam raela vaedi thaena** (the place where warm lava flows).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Prushtaya vadaa thuni nisa asannaye udam rala wadi washayen tibiya haekiya. laavaa valata mathupitata ema vadaa pahasu viya.""  This translates to ""The surface was covered in a way that seemed to have been solidified by flowing warm lava. This surface is easily recognizable from the lava flow to the parent rock.""

This directly indicates that the surface is characterized by solidified lava flows. Therefore, the place where warm lava flows is where this type of surface would be found.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: aasanna paeththe** (nearby places) - The passage doesn't specify location relative to other places.
*   **C: usbim walata pahalin** (looking at hot springs) - Hot springs aren't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: udam raelata pahalin** (looking at warm lava) - While related, the passage describes *solidified* lava, not actively flowing lava. It's the remnants *of* the lava flow that characterizes the surface.

Here's why:

The passage (P) describes people who are seeking a new world (""pudgalayin wenath tharu walata gaman kara""). They are tired of the current world and believe in a life beyond it (""wenath grahalokayaka pitaththarayan ho wenath jivin aethi bhava visvaasa karati"").  The question (Q) asks what these people *believe*. Option A directly reflects this belief expressed in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: pudgalayinta wenath lokayan gaweshanaya kirime haekiyaawak naetha** (They don't search for a new world for individuals) - This is the *opposite* of what the passage states.
*   **C: wenath grahaloka wala jiwaya pawathiyi** (They are reborn in a new world) - While they *believe* in a life beyond this one, the passage doesn't definitively say they are reborn.
*   **D: tharakaa athara dura saethapum triliyanayakata wada aduya** (They discuss the distances of stars and the calculation of trillions) - This is a detail about a specific person's (the astrologer's) activities, not a widespread belief of the people described in the passage.



"
oba suryayaage kendrayen iwathata yana wita thuneenee wanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: vayuwa**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""...*Suryayage madyayen kramayen ivathata yaddi vayuva kramayen thuni we.*""  This translates to ""...gradually falling towards the center of the sun is a stream of gas.""  ""Vayuwa"" means gas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: plasma** - While the sun *contains* plasma, the passage specifically mentions gas falling towards the center.
*   **B: gindra** - ""Gindra"" means metal, which isn't described as falling towards the center.
*   **D: prushtaya** - ""Prushtaya"" means layer, and refers to the initial layer mentioned, not what falls inwards.



"
"chedaya anuwa, pruthiwiye sita daekiya haekke suryayaage kumana kotasa da?","The correct answer is **A: prushtaya** (layers).

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""Pruthuwiye men obata sitagena sitiya haeki **prushtayak** suryayata nomaeta.""  This translates to: ""From Earth, the layers visible to the eye are called the layers of the sun.""

The question (Q) asks: ""According to the passage, what are the layers of the sun visible from Earth?""

Therefore, the answer directly from the text is ""prushtaya"" (layers).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: plasmawa** (plasma) - The passage *mentions* plasma as a component of the sun, but doesn't identify it as the visible layers.
* **C: prabhagolaya** (sphere) -  While the sun is spherical, the question asks about *layers*, not the shape.
* **D: maeda** (field) - This isn't mentioned in the passage in relation to visible layers of the sun.

koparnikas n‍yaaya thahawuru kirimata pahatha sandahan nireekshana walin upakaaree wuye kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: sikuruge sank‍ranthiya** (the transit of Mercury).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...weenasge aethi avadhi tulin koparnikasge nyaaya wana suryaya vataa grahaloka bramanaya wana bhava kiyana tharkayata sahaya dakvayi.""  This translates to ""Observations of this period helped support Copernicus's theory that the sun, not the Earth, is at the center and the planets revolve around it.""
* **The passage further explains *how* it helped:** It mentions observing the transit of Mercury (""avadhi tulin"") – when Mercury passes between the Earth and the Sun.  This observation wouldn't be possible if the Earth was the center of the solar system.
* **The passage then talks about Jeremiah Horrocks observing a transit of Venus in 1639**, further demonstrating the importance of observing these transits to support the heliocentric (Copernicus) model.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sikuruge adiyara** (Mercury's orbit) - While Mercury's orbit is *related* to the concept, the passage specifically highlights the *transit* (sankranthiya) as the key observation.
* **C: suryayaa saha sikuru athara samanakam** (the similarity between the Sun and Mercury) - The passage doesn't focus on similarities, but on *position* relative to Earth and the Sun.
* **D: suryayaa saha chandrayaa athara samanakam** (the similarity between the Sun and the Moon) - The passage focuses on Mercury, not the Moon.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""weenasge aethi avadhi tulin koparnikasge nyaaya wana suryaya vataa grahaloka bramanaya wana bhava kiyana tharkayata sahaya dakvayi.""  This translates to: ""This evidence helped support the theory that the sun is the center, and planets revolve around it, like Copernicus argued.""
* **Galileo's observations in 1610** were key in providing this evidence.  He observed the phases of Venus and the moons of Jupiter, which were difficult to explain if the Earth was the center of the universe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: suryayaata muhunala sitina chandrayaage paeththak** (phases of the moon illuminated by the sun) - While Galileo observed the moon, the passage focuses on evidence supporting the heliocentric model.
* **B: sikuruge adiyara** (spots on the sun) -  He also observed sunspots, but that's not the main point of the passage regarding his crucial findings.
* **D: sikuruge sank‍ranthiya** (transit of Mercury) -  Jeremiah Horrocks observed this later in 1639, not Galileo in 1610.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""eya kudaa gangavan dahas gananakin jalaya ekathu kara ganee."" which translates to ""it collects water from thousands of streams.""  This directly answers the question of how the Amazon river collects water.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: digama gangawa** - The Digama Ganga is mentioned as being *smaller* than the Amazon, not a source of its water.
* **C: muhuda** - The ocean *receives* water from the Amazon, it doesn't provide water *to* it.
* **D: dewana wishalathama gangawa** - This is simply a descriptive name for the Amazon (widest river) and doesn't explain how it collects water.

* The passage also repeatedly emphasizes the Amazon's vastness and large volume of water.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eya dewana digama gangawayi** (It is the longest river) - While the passage mentions its length, the primary focus is on its *width* and volume.
* **C: eya digama gangawayi** (It is a long river) - This is too general and doesn't capture the key characteristic highlighted in the text.
* **D: eya pululma gangawayi** (It is a muddy river) - The passage doesn't focus on the color or muddiness of the Amazon.

mema chedaye sandahan awama washayen wenisiyulanuwan sankyaawak sewaye yodava aeththe kumana vaeda wargayada?,"The correct answer is **B: karmanthaya** (industry/labor).

Here's why:

The passage (P) discusses the importance of labor (""karati"") in Venezuela, specifically mentioning both industrial labor (""karmaanthavala"") and agricultural labor (""krushikarmaanthaye""). It emphasizes that a significant portion of the Venezuelan workforce is involved in these types of labor.  The question (Q) asks what *type* of work is heavily represented in Venezuela.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: krushikarmaya (agriculture):** While agriculture *is* mentioned, the passage stresses both industrial and agricultural work, making it too narrow of an answer.
*   **C: thel (oil):** Oil is mentioned as something Venezuela *could* rely on less, suggesting it's not the primary workforce driver.
*   **D: sevawan (services):**  The passage doesn't focus on the service sector.



Therefore, **karmanthaya (industry/labor)** best encompasses the broad description of the Venezuelan workforce presented in the text."
mema chedaye sandahan vaedima wenisiylanuwan sankyaawak sewaye yodava aeththe kumana vaeda anshayada?,"The correct answer is **C: karmanthaya**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) heavily focuses on ""karmanthaya"" (industries/employment).** It discusses various types of employment (services, agriculture, industries) in Venezuela and how they contribute to the economy.  The core of the text revolves around the economic impact of different sectors of employment.
* **Let's look at why the other options are less fitting:**
    * **A: sevawan (services):** While services are mentioned, they are *one* type of employment, not the overarching theme.
    * **B: krushikarmaya (agriculture):**  Like services, agriculture is a *component* of the Venezuelan economy discussed, but not the central focus.
    * **D: thel (oil):**  Oil is mentioned as a key resource, but the passage is about the broader *industries* and employment landscape, not solely oil.

* **The question (Q) asks what *kind* of work is mentioned in the passage.** ""Karmanthaya"" – the umbrella term for industries and types of work – is the most accurate answer.



Therefore, the passage is fundamentally about the different *karmanthaya* (industries/types of work) in Venezuela."
"mema chedayata anuwa, wilayanaya tharakaawalata kirimata ida denne kumak sandaha da?","The correct answer is **B: wilayana prathikriyaakaaraka thaeneema** (meaning: the dissolving reactant).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a process where a substance (the ""vadaat bara sanghataka"") dissolves (wilayana) and releases energy, producing light and heat.** This means the substance is acting as a reactant *in a dissolving reaction*.  The question asks what the passage identifies as being *in* the dissolving process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: wadath bara sanghataka thaeneema (the substance that dissolves)** - The passage describes what *happens* when this substance dissolves, not that it *is* the dissolving process itself.
* **C: aalokaya ha ushnathwaya labaa deema (gives light and heat)** - This is a *result* of the dissolving process, not what's actively involved *in* it.
* **D: hayidrajan paramanu thaeneema (hydrogen atoms)** - While hydrogen might be involved in the substance, the passage doesn’t explicitly state it's the key component of the dissolving reaction.



"
pahatha sandahan dewalin p‍rayojanawath wilayana p‍rathikriyaakaarakayak nirmanaya karanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: hayidrajan (Hydrogen)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""vadaat bara sanghataka thaenimata **hydrajan** paramanu bedima (ho kaedima) nisa shakthiya muktha weemen tharaka aalokaya saha ushnathwaya labaa de.""  This translates to: ""The most important component is **hydrogen** atoms, which release energy in the form of light and heat when combined (or split).""

The passage directly identifies hydrogen as the key reactant in the described process. The other options are incorrect:

* **Tharu (Stars):** Stars *use* the reaction, they aren't the reactant.
* **Paramanu (Atoms):** Atoms are part of the hydrogen, but hydrogen is the specific element being discussed.
* **Balashakthiya (Energy):** Energy is *released* by the reaction, it's not the reactant.

Therefore, the question asks what is used to create useful fusion reactants, and the passage clearly states it is hydrogen.



"
jalaye rasayanika sanyuthiya kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: ek hayidrajan paramanuwak ha oksijan paramanu dekak**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""sanyukta jalaya haiderajan paramaanu dekakin saha ek oxygen paramaanuvakin saedee aetha.""  This translates to ""compound water consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.""

Let's break down the options:

* **A: ek hayidrajan paramanuwak ha oksijan paramanu dekak** - One hydrogen atom and two oxygen atoms - **INCORRECT**
* **B: ek hayidrajan paramanuwak ha oksijan paramanuwak** - One hydrogen atom and one oxygen atom - **INCORRECT**
* **C: hayidrajan paramanu dekak ha oksijan paramanu dekak** - Two hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms - **INCORRECT**
* **D: hayidrajan paramanu dekak ha oksijan paramanuwak** - Two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom - **CORRECT**

Therefore, the answer is **D**.



"
jalaya ehi svabhaya wenas karana wita esema pawathinne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: anuka wyuhaya** (molecular structure).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Eya vayuvak, dravayak how ghanayak vuvat eyata aeththe ekama anuka vyuhayaki.""  This translates to ""It can be a gas, liquid, or solid depending on its *molecular structure*.""  The passage directly links the state (gas, liquid, solid) to the arrangement of molecules.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ghanathwaya** (solidity) - This is *a* state of water, but not the *reason* for its varying states.
* **C: bhawthika thathwaya** (physical properties) - While state is a physical property, the passage specifically points to molecular structure as the determining factor.
* **D: drawa nayitrajan** (liquid nitrogen) - This is an example mentioned in the passage, not the reason for water's states.

"chedayata anuwa, aethaem neethi paenavimata uthsaha kirimedee p‍rantha dahathuna sandaha pahatha sandahan karunuwalin gaetaluwak nowuye kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: ekamathika anumaethiya awashya sanshodhana (unanimous consent required for amendments)**.

Here's why:

* **The Passage Focuses on Amendments:** The passage heavily discusses how changes to the system (vyavasthaava sansodhanaya) require the unanimous consent (ekamatika anumaetiya) of all states/provinces (janapadaya).  It states that even when a medium-sized state is disadvantaged, amending the system to address it is incredibly difficult due to this requirement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: jaathika baladhaareenge daedi adheekshanaya (supervision by national power base):** While the national government (federal adhikarin) plays a role, the passage emphasizes the *difficulty* of national power overriding state concerns, not its supervision.
* **B: kongrasaya thula balaya nomaethikama (Congress lacks significant power):** The passage actually portrays Congress as having a significant role, even if it's constrained by the state requirement for amendments.  It is Congress that initiates the process.
* **D: nopawathina jaathika widhaayakayak (no national legislature):** The passage clearly refers to *jaathika vidhaayakayak* (national legislature/Congress).



Therefore, the passage’s central point regarding the challenges of addressing inequality stems from the extremely high bar for amending the system – requiring unanimous consent."
"mema chedayata anuwa, wiplaviya yuddhaya atharathura madhyama aanduwe thathwaya niwaerediwa pilibimbu karanne kumana p‍rakaashayada?","The correct answer is **A: badu balathmaka karanu laebuwe kongrasaya ha p‍rantha baladhaareen wisinya** (a powerful Congress and state powers working together).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a system where Congress is strong (due to the need for unanimous consent from states for amendments) and states retain significant power.** It's a balance between a strong central government (Congress) and strong state governments.  The passage mentions Congress needing the approval of *all* states to amend the constitution, and states having control over their own policies. This points to a system where both are influential.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: vyavasthaawa sanshodhanaya kirima kongrasaye adhikaariya matha randa pawathee** (Congress's authority to amend the system and two powers) - While Congress *can* propose amendments, they require unanimous state approval, diminishing their sole authority. The passage highlights the power *of the states* in the amendment process.
* **C: rajya niyojithayinta paevaethmak nomaethi wiya** (not being subject to state appointments) - This is not discussed in the passage. The focus is on the *relationship* between states and the central government, not on personnel appointments.
* **D: madhyama rajaya p‍radhaana kotas dekakin samanwitatha wiya** (the integration of the main quotas of the central state) - The passage doesn't discuss quotas or integration of central state elements. It's about the balance of power.



Therefore, option A best reflects the central idea of the passage: a powerful Congress *working with*, and constrained by, strong state powers."
nidhas p‍rakaashanaye pitupasa aethi wachana liyaa aeththe keseda?,"The correct answer is **C: udu yatikuru lesa** (using thin lines).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nidahas prakaashanaya pitupasa liya aethi wachana wanne """"1776 juuli 4 dinaeti mul nidahas prakaashanaya"""" yannayi. mema pela lekhanaye pitupasa udu yatikuru athata disve.""  This translates to: ""The writing on the back of the Declaration of Independence reads """"The original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776"""". This writing appears to be done with thin lines.""

Therefore, the writing on the back of the Declaration of Independence is described as being done **using thin lines** (udu yatikuru lesa).



"
singappuruwa keerthimath wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kumak sandahada?,"The correct answer is **A: nagarika harithabhawaya** (civic greenery/urban greenery).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** describes the founding of a special botanical garden in Singapore, initiated by Miss Joaquim in 1981, and her efforts to cultivate the national flower.  This directly relates to improving the greenery and beauty of the city (civic greenery).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: kandu naegeema** (sculpture) - The passage doesn't mention sculpture.
* **C: wik‍ramanwitatha kreeda** (sports and recreation) - While a garden *could* have recreational aspects, the primary focus of the passage is on its botanical nature and the national flower.
* **D: ranga kalawa** (fine arts) -  Similar to sculpture, the passage doesn’t focus on fine arts.



"
vaenda mis jokim yanu kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: udbhida udyaanayak (a botanical garden)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""demuhun okid vargayak wana vaenda miss jokim, deshayehi jaathika pushpaya lesa tora ganna ladi."" This translates to ""Miss Joakim planted a muhun okid variety, and it grew into a national flower-bearing tree in the country.""  This clearly indicates she planted something in a garden – specifically, a botanical garden (udbhida udyaanayak) as the passage describes the larger context of a special botanical garden in Singapore.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: doopathak (bridge):** The passage doesn't mention anything about a bridge.
*   **B: malak (flower):** While the tree bears flowers, Miss Joakim isn't a flower herself. She *planted* a tree that grew to bear flowers.
*   **D: jaathika smarakayak (national monument):** The passage focuses on a plant, not a monument.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, geesa piramidawala kumana gunathmakabhawayata nawa rajadhaaniye egypthuwerun mawitha kala nohaeki vi da?","The correct answer is **D: ewaye idikirim (their shape)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) emphasizes that the new capital was built *because* the old pyramids were remarkable for their shape and size.** It states they were ""akhandava paewathiya da, an kisivak gisave piramidavala visalatvaya saha ema idikirimvala thaaksanika visistatvaya kedinakavat paraya giye naetha"" - meaning, no one could match the size and *shape* of the pyramids.
* **The question (Q) asks what quality of the pyramids the new capital in Egypt didn't possess.**  The answer isn't age (A), material (B), or size (C) because the passage implies the new capital *couldn't* replicate the *distinctive form* of the pyramids.

Therefore, the new capital couldn't match the pyramids' unique shape, making **D** the most logical answer.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, shaka bhak‍shakayan vaesi luhubaendeema sandaha gaman karanne kothaeninda?","The correct answer is **A: batahira thaenithalawa**.

Here's why:

The question (Q) asks where the herbivores migrate *from*. The passage clearly states they move *from* the northern highlands *to* the southern lowlands (batahira thaenithalawa).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: uthuru kandukaraya** - This is where they *start* their journey, not where they are coming *from* in the context of the question.
*   **C: dakshina thaenithalawa** - This is where they are going *to*.
*   **D: batahira kandukaraya** - The passage refers to ""batahira thaenithalawa"" (southern lowlands), not ""batahira kandukaraya"" (southern highlands).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...kenyave maasaayi maaraa jaathika raksitaya anthargatha we."" ( ...within Kenya's Maasai Mara National Reserve).
* **The question asks:** Where do the herbivores cross the Mara River in April?
* The passage specifically links the April crossing of the Mara River to the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem which *includes* the Maasai Mara National Reserve.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Serengeti Kalapaya (Serengeti Ecosystem):** While the crossing happens *within* the Serengeti ecosystem, the question asks for a specific place.
* **B: Dakshina Thaenithalawa (Southern Tanzania):** This is where the journey *begins*, not where the April crossing occurs.
* **C: Mara Gaga (Mara River):**  The river is *where* they cross, not *which* area/reserve they are in when they cross.

The text states: ""Germaniya mema prahaaraya """"operation seelayan"""" lesa nam karana ladi."" (Germany named this attack ""Operation Seelion"").  Therefore, Operation Seelion was a German attack."
germaniya b‍rithan‍yayata ella kala p‍raharaya haendinwuye keseda?,"The correct answer is **B: opareshan seelayan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Germaniya mema prahaaraya """"operation seelayan"""" lesa nam karana ladi.""  This translates to ""Germany named this attack """"operation seelayan""""."" 

Therefore, ""operation seelayan"" is the name Germany gave to the attack on Britain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: dankrik** - Dunkirk is a location where British troops were evacuated, a *result* of the attack, not the name of the attack itself.
*   **C: k‍reegsmaereen** - This is the German navy, not the name of the attack.
*   **D: royal nevi** - This is the British navy, also not the name of the attack.

This translates to ""This island provided them with a strategic location to control the Mediterranean Sea and launch an attack on Africa.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eejipthuwe naew iwath kirima** (navigating the Nile River in Egypt) - The passage doesn't mention the Nile River or Egypt specifically.
* **B: amathara naew thaeneema** (blocking naval lanes) - While controlling the Mediterranean *could* affect naval lanes, the primary stated purpose was strategic positioning for attack.
* **D: b‍rithan‍ya kandawuru winasha kirima** (destroying British strongholds) - The passage mentions Britain being affected, but doesn't say the island was taken *to* destroy British strongholds.  It was for control of the Mediterranean and attacking Africa.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, ithaliye yuddhaye p‍radhaana aramuna lesa saelakuwe kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: ap‍rikaanu ratawal alla gaeneema** (to control the African coast).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Italiye pradhaana aramunu vuye aprikaaanu ratawal ya."" (Italy's main goal was the African coast.)  It then goes on to explain how controlling the African coast would allow them to challenge British naval bases and influence the Mediterranean Sea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: shakthimath hamudawak saha nawika hamudawak godanaegeema** (to obtain powerful armies and navies) - While important, this is *how* they planned to achieve their goal, not the goal itself.
* **C: eejipthu naew iwath kirima** (to attack Egypt) - The passage mentions Egypt as a consequence of controlling the African coast, not the primary goal.
* **D: b‍rithan‍ya kandawuru pihituvima** (to defeat British control) -  This is a *result* they hoped for by controlling the African coast, not the main objective.



"

The text states: ""Eya """"vichi"""" pransha jathikayan visin palanaya karana ladi. ovun, 1940 dee germanuvan samaga saamaya goda nagaagena aethi, aakramanikayanta erehiva satan kireema venuvata ovun ha waeda kala pransha janathava wei."" 

This translates to: ""It is a government run by the 'Vichi' French nation. They aligned with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupying forces and the French people.""

Therefore, the *Vichi French* were the ones collaborating with the aggressors (the Germans).  The other options are incorrect:

*   **Germanuvan (Germans):** They *were* the aggressors, not collaborators *with* the aggressors.
*   **Aemarikaanuwan (Americans):** They joined later to liberate France, they weren't initially collaborating.
*   **Nidhas Pranshaya (Liberated France):**  This refers to France *after* liberation, not during the initial occupation.



"

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hudek sati dekak thula aemerikanuvan saha nidahas pransha hamuda yana eva dakunu pranshaya nidahas kara gene thibu athara germaniya desata haeremin tibini.""  This translates to: ""After nearly four years, Southern France was liberated with the help of Americans and liberated France, and Germany was defeated.""

The ""draegan meheyuma"" (Operation Dragoon) was the Allied invasion of Southern France, involving American and French forces. Therefore, the answer is Americans and liberated France.

This translates to: ""Even before the war started, they were able to identify the underwater path of the submarines with the help of **radar**.""

Therefore, radar was used to detect the submarines' underwater travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: yu-bottu** - While mentioned as the name of a German U-boat, it's not the *equipment* used for detection.
*   **B: wedi thaebeeme parasaya** - This doesn't appear in the text and isn't related to submarine detection.
*   **C: sanchalanaya** - This means ""operation"" or ""management"" and isn't a piece of equipment.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sabmaerina palawana loka yuddhayedi menma dewana loka yuddhayedida bhavitha karana ladi.""  This translates to ""Submarines were used to initiate world wars and instigate world wars.""  The key here is *instigate* – submarines were used to *communicate* the start of war, to signal the beginning of conflict.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sanchalanaya (operation/management):** While submarines *participate* in operations, the passage emphasizes their role in *starting* the war.
*   **C: wedi thaebeema (bombing):**  The passage doesn't specifically mention bombing as the primary way submarines initiated conflict.
*   **D: kriyaakara vima (execution/implementation):**  Similar to ""operation,"" this refers to *doing* things in war, not *starting* it.

"mema chedayata anuwa, giwisumak ullanghanaya kale kawuda? ","The correct answer is **D: sowiyatwaru** (Soviets).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the Soviets invaded Poland (""soviyat polantha aakramanaya""). It also details how they mobilized a large army (800,000+ troops) from Belarus and Ukraine to build up forces for the invasion.  The text focuses on the Soviet Union's actions as a violation of international law and agreements.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: polantha jaathikayin** (Polish nation) - Poland was the *victim* of the invasion, not the perpetrator of a violation.
*   **B: rumeniyaanuwan** (Romania) - While Romania is mentioned, the text doesn't state they violated any agreements.
*   **C: yukreniyaanuwan** (Ukraine) - Ukraine was a territory from which Soviet troops were mobilized, but the violation was carried out *by* the Soviets, not Ukraine itself.

The question (Q) asks what was done to prepare for something. The passage directly links the gathering of forces to building the Ukrainian front.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: naegenahira p‍radesha aak‍ramanaya kirima** (attacking the eastern regions) - While the passage mentions attacking eastern regions, it's a *result* of the preparation, not the preparation itself.
* **C: paalama dige p‍rathisanwidhaanayak** (a counter-constitution) - This is a minor detail in the passage and not related to the large-scale preparation.
* **D: giwisumak ullanghanaya kirima** (violating agreements) - While violations of agreements are mentioned, they are the *context* of the conflict, not the specific preparations being asked about.

The text states: ""Naegenahira baardiya wetha sidu kerunu raeka sita pahara deemakin, brithaanyayo itaali jaathika dasavana yudha injineru pradhaani general laestusi alla gathha.""

This translates to: ""After carefully examining the situation, at that crucial moment, British and Italian national war engineer-in-chief General Laestusi went to fight.""  

Therefore, General Laestusi went to fight *against* the British.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ohu kaepuso kotuwe dee alla ganna ladee** - The text says he went *from* Kapuso fort, not *to* it.
*   **B: ohu tobruk hidee mara damana ladee** - While Tobruk is mentioned, the text doesn't say he went there to die.

Therefore, Italo Balbo died near Tobruk.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Kundalini yoga mangin yoga anga vinyasa, **svasana abyaasa**, mathra saha drushyamana kireem haraha kundalini shakthiya...""  This directly links *svasana abyaasa* (breath control) as a component of Kundalini yoga within the Tibetan Buddhist context described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: naewatha naewathath manth‍ra gayana kirima** (chanting mantras repeatedly): While mantras are *mentioned* alongside breath control, the text doesn't highlight it as a primary aspect of Tibetan *bhawanawe* (meditation).
* **C: devaganan daekima** (various deities):  The text states devatas are part of the *yoga* within *bhawanawe*, but not the core practice itself. It's about utilizing their energies, not directly *being* them.
* **D: yoga anga vinyasa praguna kireema** (performing yoga postures/asanas): While mentioned alongside breath work, it’s presented as part of the broader Kundalini yoga practices, not specifically within the *bhawanawe* aspect highlighted.

* **C: naewatha naewathath manth‍ra gayana kirimen** (constantly chanting mantras) - Mantras are mentioned in relation to Kundalini yoga, but not specifically in the description of *bhavana*.
* **D: svasana abyaasa puhunu kireema** (practicing breathing exercises) - Breathing exercises are part of Kundalini Yoga, not the core of Tibetan *bhavana*.

"mema chedayata anuwa, aahara puja kirime dee bhakthi geethayak idiripath kale kawuda?","The correct answer is **A: lakkhaa sing**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lakkha Sing bhajana gayanaye pramukhasthaanaya gatteya. Baba Shyaam visin chappan bhog pigan 108 k ... piliganvana ladi. Lak sing visin chappan bhoga bhajan da idiripath karana ladi.""  This directly translates to ""Lakkha Sing took the lead in singing bhajans. Baba Shyam offered 108 k of 56 types of food... Lakkha Sing also performed the 56 types of food bhajan.""

Therefore, Lakkha Sing is the one who performed the bhajan related to the food offering (aahara puja)."
sandhyaa kaalaye dewana awasan vaedasatahana wuye kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: sesen aksu, aelessaendro safina saha haris aeleksiyo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Turkey jaathika prasiddha gayika sezen aksu italiyanu opera sangitagna alessandro safina saha greeka gaayaka haris alexiou samaga gayana kalaaa ya.""  This directly translates to ""Turkey's national famous singer Sezen Aksu, Italian opera singer Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou performed songs together.""

The question asks who performed in the evening show. These three singers are specifically mentioned as performing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: fire of anatolia** - While mentioned, it's described as *performing a play* (""troy""), not as being part of the evening performance alongside the singers.
* **C: whirling dervishes** - They are described as being *on stage*, but not performing *with* the others.
* **D: faathih erkoch saha muslum gursas** -  They are mentioned as accompanying the orchestra, not as being the primary performers listed in the context of the evening show.



"
aelessaendro safinage jaathikathwaya kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: ithali**.

The text states: ""italiayanu opera sangitagna alessandro safina..."" which translates to ""Italian opera singer Alessandro Safina..."".  Therefore, Alessandro Safina's nationality is Italian.

"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashayangen sath‍ya nowanne kawaredaa?","Let's break down the original text (P) and the question (Q) to determine the correct answer.

**Understanding the Text (P):**

The text is a somewhat convoluted and poetic description. Here's a rough attempt at interpreting it, focusing on keywords:

* **""Maginta jalaya labaa dene ladde...""** -  Seems to be referring to a pink/purple water source yielding profits.
* **""...90 (f)ka thaapayakata maedi wee sity vita ya.""** - A heat reading of 90 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded after three weeks.
* **""Gini nivime hamuda kapithan scott cons paewasoowe...""** -  Captain Scott's observation concerning fire and darkness.
* **""...eya 90 ganan wala saanta klaaraavala ushnatvaya ihala agayaka pawathi unusuma dinayak woo bavayi.""** - The 90-degree reading in Santa Clara suggests a warm day.
* **""...onaema kaalayak roller kostarayaka siravi siteema apahasutavayak wana athara...""** - Something about a black roller coaster offering a beautiful view.
* **""...avama washayen kivahot, palamu pudgalaya in basa yamata avamayen paeyakwath gatha viya haeka.""** -  A statement about the first particle/individual being affected.

**Understanding the Question (Q):**

""Based on this text, which of the following statements is most likely true?""  We need to find the statement *supported* by the text.

**Analyzing the Options:**

* **A: saenta klara hi ginnak aethi wiya (Santa Clara is hot)** - The text *directly* states the 90-degree reading in Santa Clara suggests a warm day (""ushnatvaya ihala agayaka"").  This is a very strong indication it's hot.
* **B: minisun rolar koostarayak thula siravi sitiyaha (People enjoy the black roller coaster)** - The text mentions a ""roller kostarayaka siravi siteema"" (beautiful view of a roller coaster), but doesn’t say *people* enjoy it.
* **C: mageenta jalaya labaa dena ladee (pink/purple water yields profit)** - This is the *starting point* of the text, but the text doesn't confirm it's actually *true*, it just states it as a starting premise.
* **D: palamu pudgalayaa eyin iwath kirimata awama washayen miniththu 60k gatha wiya (the first particle was affected in a way that cost 60k)** - This is a highly specific detail and while mentioned, doesn’t seem to be the primary focus or most likely truth derived from the passage.

**Conclusion:**

The most directly supported and likely true statement is **A: saenta klara hi ginnak aethi wiya (Santa Clara is hot)**.  The text provides concrete evidence (the 90-degree reading) for this claim.



Therefore, the answer is **A**."
"mema chedayata anuwa, mahath apahasuthawayata path kala ushnathwa mattama gaena adhas daekwuye kawuda?","The correct answer is **B: gini niwana hamudawe kapithan** (Fire Prevention Officer).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly mentions ""gini nivime hamuda kapithan scott cons paewasoowe""** - meaning ""Fire Prevention Officer Scott Cons Paewasoowe"".  The passage then describes this officer's statement about high temperatures and potential fire risk.
* **Question (Q) asks who would be most concerned with unusually high temperatures.**  A fire prevention officer would *absolutely* be concerned with this, as high temperatures increase fire risk.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: dhaawana kriyaakaru (cleaning staff)** - While important, cleaning staff wouldn't be the primary responders to temperature warnings related to fire.
* **C: mageen (me)** - The passage doesn't suggest a personal connection or that ""I"" am the relevant authority.
* **D: polis p‍radhaaniyaa (police chief)** - While police might be involved *after* a fire, the initial concern about high temperatures and fire prevention falls to a fire safety expert.



Therefore, the Fire Prevention Officer is the most logical answer based on the information provided."
sunami kriyaakaarakam hethuwen widuliya binda vaeteemak sidu wuye koheda?,"The correct answer is **A: tonga**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Tonga hi kisidu vishaala haani ho alaabha kisivak vaartha wee nomaeti namuth, **viduli balaya thaavakalikava binda vaetuni.**""  This translates to ""...though Tonga did not have any significant damage or news of losses, **the electricity supply was cut off.**""

The question asks where the electricity was cut off *because of* the tsunami. The text directly links the power outage to Tonga.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: niyu:**  The text mentions ""niyu"" (Pago Pago) but doesn't say the electricity was cut off there.
*   **C: havayi hi pasaelwala:**  While ""havayi hi pasaelwala"" (Hawaiian islands) is mentioned in a later context, it's not related to the initial power outage.
*   **D: pago pago:** Same as 'niyu', no mention of power outage.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, tonga widuliya binda vaeteemen balapaemata lak wuye keseda?","The correct answer is **B: iwath karana lada anathuru aegavim sambandhayen baladhaareenta p‍rawurthi laebune naetha** (There is no mention of support being received for future disaster prevention).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the *lack* of support following the tsunami.** It states ""ema nisa ptwc magin nikuth kala sunaami anaturu haengavim labaagaenimata tongave baladhaarinta nohaeki woo bhava paewase"" which translates to ""even now, there is no support to prevent future tsunamis.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: yam haaniyak vaartha wiya** (This is devastating news) - While the passage *describes* devastation, it doesn't state this explicitly as the focus.
* **C: muhudu mattame kiyavim walata balapaem aethi wiya** (Support came from the sea) - This is completely incorrect; the passage highlights the *absence* of support.
* **D: baladhaareenta adala anathuru aegavim labaa gaeneemata nohaeki wiya** (There is no benefit in obtaining future disaster prevention) - The passage doesn't say disaster prevention is pointless, only that support for it is lacking.



"
polisiyata owunge redar thuwakku bhawithakara jonee reedge riya paedavime wegaya maeneemata haeki wuye kawadada?,"The correct answer is **A: ohu paeyata kilomeetara 160 ka wegayen riya padwamin sitiyadee** (He was driving at 160 kilometers per hour).

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** How did Johnny Reed manage to avoid the police radar when measuring his speed?
* **The text states:**  ""...ekama velawa vuye ohu paeyakata kilo meetara 160 dakva vegaya adu kala vita pamanayi."" This translates to ""He managed to drive at 160 kilometers per hour without being caught by the speed radar.""

Therefore, the answer is that he was driving at 160 kilometers per hour and wasn't detected.  Options B, C, and D are irrelevant to *how* he avoided detection.



"
mema chedayata anuwa nawaseelantha polisiyata jonee reedge wegaya maeneema dushkara wanne aeyi?,"The correct answer is **A: ohu paeyata kilomeetara 160 ta adu wegayakin dhaawanaya karamin sitiyeya.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks why it would be difficult for the police to accurately measure Johnny Rid's speed.** The passage explicitly states that Rid was traveling at 160 km/h, and the police radar gun might not have been able to accurately capture that speed (""...vega radar mevalam bhavitha kirimata nohaeki woo..."").  Option A directly addresses this by saying he was driving at a speed of 160 km/h, making accurate measurement difficult.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: motar rathaya itha pahath wiya** (The car was visible) -  While true, this doesn't explain the difficulty in measuring speed.
* **C: ohu paalama matha gaman kale hath wathawak pamani** (He was seen passing the bridge) - Again, this is a fact from the passage, but irrelevant to the question of speed measurement.
* **D: okland waraya paalama itha paerani ya** (The Oakland bridge was crossed) - This is just a location detail and doesn't relate to the problem of measuring speed.



"
bat bhoomikampawa kendragatha wuye koheda?,"The correct answer is **B: saethapum 40k dakunata** (approximately 40k south).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bhumikampava kendhragatha vuye delan sita isaana desin kilometara 20 k (saethapum 15 k) saha **butte sita kilo meetara 65 k (saethapum 40 k) dakunata ya.**"" 

This translates to: ""The earthquake's epicenter was located 20 km (approximately 15 km) east and **65 kilometers (approximately 40 km) south.**""

Therefore, the epicenter was approximately 40 km south."
abu grayibhi aethi wu koolahala atharathura sidu wuye kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: sirakaruwan apayojanaya kirima** (torture by government officials).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** explicitly states that Kaeraellak (likely referring to events at Abu Ghraib) involved *sirakaruvan apayojanaya* (government official torture).  The passage condemns this.
* **Q (the question)** asks what happened at Abu Ghraib.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: wasa daemeema (flood damage)** - The passage doesn't mention flooding.
* **C: eksath janapada hamuda palanaya labaa gathha (received unified national policy)** - The passage describes something *negative* happening, not a policy being received.
* **D: bandhanagarayata gini thabana ladee (received fire in the prison)** - While the passage mentions fire, it’s a *result* of the torture, not the main event itself. The core issue is *who* caused it and *why*.



Therefore, **A** most accurately reflects the information presented in the passage about Abu Ghraib."
iraka bandhanagara apakeerthiyata path wuye aeyi? ,"The correct answer is **A: eyata gini thabana ladee** (It was due to burning prisoners).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** directly states ""Kaeraellak atharathura dee iraaqaye abu gharayib bandhanagarayata gini thabaa tibini"" - meaning prisoners were burned at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. This is presented as *the* reason for the prison's notoriety.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: eksath janapada hamuda palanaya labaa gathha** (received a policy of collective punishment) - While collective punishment *may* have been a factor, the passage highlights burning as the primary reason for the infamy.
* **C: ehi kaerali gananawak aethi wiya** (there were many counts of torture here) - Torture is implied, but burning is specifically mentioned.
* **D: sira karuwan apayojanaya kirima pilibanda soyaagaeneema** (allegations regarding the deployment of intelligence officers) - This is a detail mentioned in the passage, but not the *reason* for the prison's bad reputation.



Therefore, **A** is the most direct and accurate answer to the question ""What caused the Iraqi prison to become infamous?""."
mawuyi hi yuda anusmarana kreedanganaye paevaethvimata niyamithawa thibune kumana aakaaraye vaedasatahanak da?,"The correct answer is **C: sangeetha p‍rasangayak (a musical presentation)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about the *form* of the Vedic recitation at the war memorial sports ground.**
* **The passage (P) heavily focuses on music (""sangita kandaayama,"" ""sangeetha prasangayak"").**  It mentions a musical presentation being organized as part of the event.
* The passage describes preparing for a musical performance (""avalangu karana laduva,"" ""kalamanakarana samagama wana"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: maejik sandarshanayak (a magic show)** - There's no mention of magic in the passage.
* **B: papandu tharagayak (a banner display)** - While banners might be *part* of the event, they aren't the primary Vedic recitation format.
* **D: aramudal sampadka vaedasatahanak (a financial resources Vedic recitation)** - This doesn't make sense in the context.  The passage is about a performance, not fundraising.



Therefore, based on the information provided, a musical presentation (sangeetha prasangayak) is the most fitting answer."
"awasana washayen, mema siduvima awalangu kirima sambandhayen paehaedili kirimak labaa dunne kawuda?","The correct answer is **A: sangeetha kandayama**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the event revolves around a ""sangita kandayama"" (music festival/performance). The entire context - the 9,000 participants, the reason for gathering, and the planning around September 20th - is all *because of* the music performance.  The passage mentions it's the *kalamanakarana samagama* (artists' gathering) and *yudha anusmarana kreedanganaye* (war memorial grounds) are *related to* the music event, but the core reason for the gathering *is* the music.  And the ""rasikayin"" (audience) are *attending* the music event.

Therefore, the primary benefit/focus of the event is the **music performance**.
"
bishkekhi nevasikayin keepa denek mankollayata wagakiwa yuththe kawurundaeyi sithuwe da?,"The correct answer is **C: wirodhathakaruwan (protesters/opponents)**.

Here's why:

* **P's text states:** ""Bishkek nevaasikayan kihipa denek dakunen paemini virodhatakaruvange nitiyata garu nokirima sambandhava chodana kale ya.""  This translates to: ""Many Bishkek residents were making requests regarding serious issues related to the policies of protesters/opponents.""

* **Q's question asks:**  ""What caused many Bishkek residents to make requests?""

Therefore, the answer is **wirodhathakaruwan (protesters/opponents)** because the text explicitly links the residents' requests to the actions/policies of this group.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: neethiya balathmaka karana niladhaareen (powerful reasons for policy):** While mentioned in the text, this doesn't *cause* the requests. It's the context *around* the protests.
* **B: welandasael himiyan (foreigners):** The text doesn't mention foreigners.
* **D: yawwanayan (youth):**  The text doesn't specify the age group making the requests.



"
dakune wirodhathakaruwanta mankollakaema pilibandawa dos paewaruwe kawuda?,"The correct answer is **A: bishkek nevasikayin** (Bishkek residents).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bishkek nevaasikayan kihipa denek dakunen paemini virodhatakaruvange nitiyata garu nokirima sambandhava chodana kale ya.""  This translates to ""Many Bishkek residents did not take the policy of those who went south as seriously, and did not maintain contact.""

The question asks *who* didn't take the southerners' actions seriously. The passage directly identifies it as Bishkek residents.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: neethiya balathmaka karana niladhaareen** (those who enforce policies forcefully) - This describes *how* some acted, not *who* didn't take the southerners seriously.
*   **C: arajikavadeen** (anarchists) - The passage mentions someone being *called* an anarchist, but it doesn't say they are the ones who didn't care about the southerners.
*   **D: jana kandayam** (public opinion) - This is too broad; the passage refers to a specific group of people.



"
ring wikunum wardhanaya athwindinu laebuwe kawadada?,"The correct answer is **A: shak taenk hi penee siteemen pasuwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Siminof paewasuwe 2013 dee pradarsana kandaayama mudal labaa deema navata daemuu shak taenk kathaangaye ohu penee siteemen pasuwa vikunum ihala giya bavayi.""  This translates to ""Siminof initially exhibited at the 2013 presentation, gaining profit from several new areas, he had a large income by selling his statement to Shak Tank.""

The question asks what was used to increase income.  The passage directly links income increase to selling the statement to Shak Tank.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 2013 dee aramudal laebeemen pasu** (Started earning from 2013) - While Siminof *started* in 2013, this isn't what increased income.
*   **C: QVC hi penee siteemen pasu** (Sold statement to QVC) -  QVC was a later platform, not the initial source of income increase.
*   **D: ADT samaga naduwak samathayakata path kirimen pasu** (Engaged in negotiations with ADT) - The passage doesn't mention ADT."
jemi siminof ring aarambha kirimata theeranaya kale kawadada?,"The correct answer is **C: aramudal labaa gaeneemen pasu** (started earning profit from the initial investment).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Siminof paewasuwe 2013 dee pradarsana kandaayama mudal labaa deema navata daemuu shak taenk kathaangaye ohu penee siteemen pasuwa vikunum ihala giya bavayi.""  This translates to: ""Siminof started to sell his initial investment profit after a certain point in the exhibition held in 2013.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: thamagema dore seenuwa p‍ramanawathwa wataha gaeneemen pasu** - This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **B: asaarthaka shak taenki hi penee siteemakin pasuwa** -  While the passage mentions ""shak taenk,"" it's connected to profit, not a lack thereof.
* **D: QVC hi saarthaka penee siteemakin pasu** -  QVC is mentioned later in the passage as a platform where he *sold* something, but not how he initially started.



Therefore, option C accurately reflects the starting point of Siminof's earnings as described in the text."
reeding reyinbo hi saema kathaangayakma daruwanta labaa dun nirdesha monava sandaha da?,"The correct answer is **A: rupavahinee vaedasatahan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""John grant aetulu samaharun visvaasa karanne aramudal sampaadanaye gaetalu saha **adyapana rupavahini vaedasatahankaranaye darshanaya venas weema yana dekama**, vaedasatahan malava avasan kirimata dhaayaka woo bavayi.""

This translates to: ""John Grant collected materials believing in the importance of obtaining and **the teaching stream of the Vedas**..."".  This ""teaching stream"" is where the information about the reading rainbow and the book comes from, linking it directly to the *rupavahinee vaedasatahan*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: desheeya pusthakaala (national library):** The passage mentions libraries generally, but doesn't specifically link them to the reading rainbow information.
*   **C: thema (topic):** This is too broad.
*   **D: grantha (book):** While the passage discusses a book, it doesn't say the *information* about the reading rainbow originates *from* a book. It comes from the ""teaching stream"".



"
reeding reyinbo malawa awalangu kirimata dayaka vi thibiya haekke kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: jon grantge mathaya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""John grant aetulu samaharun visvaasa karanne aramudal sampaadanaye gaetalu saha adyapana rupavahini vaedasatahankaranaye darshanaya venas weema yana dekama, vaedasatahan malava avasan kirimata dhaayaka woo bavayi.""  This translates to: ""John Grant's ideas led to the belief in ancestral editing and the educational method of Vedasathan, and it was this that became the reason for the end of the Vedasathan lineage.""

Therefore, John Grant's ideas are directly identified as the cause for the decline of the Vedasathan lineage. The question asks what caused the decline, making C the correct response.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: pramanawath aramudal nomaethi kama** - This isn't explicitly stated as the cause.
*   **B: emee sammana nomaethikama** - This is mentioned but not as the direct reason for the lineage ending.
*   **D: mistar rojars neybarhud hi saarthakathwaya** - Mr. Rojars is mentioned, but his storytelling isn't identified as the root cause.

Here's why:

* **The original text (P)** explicitly mentions ""gasa pus vargayakin aasaadanaya wee aethi"" (based on the comfort of the gas/fuel class). This is a key detail in the passage.
* **Option C** directly reflects this point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eya anivaryayenma vaetenu aetha** (It certainly will not happen) - The text doesn't state it *won't* happen, just asks *when* it will happen.
* **B: eya sanrakshanaya kala yuthuya** (It will take time to protect it) - While protection is mentioned, it's not the central focus of the question's context.
* **D: eya mahajana sawukyayata tharjanayaki** (It will be a source of public well-being) - The text mentions public well-being, but it's a result, not the *basis* of the situation being described.



**In summary, the question asks about the foundation or basis of the situation discussed in the initial paragraph, and the only option that directly answers that is the one relating to the comfort/needs of the gas/fuel class.**"
"RSPCA sandaha p‍radhaana pareek‍shakawarayekuta anuwa, pareekshana sidu kirima sandaha pahatha daekwena ewayin sammatha wiya yuththe kawaredaa?","The correct answer is **A: CCTV kaemara**.

The passage states: ""cctv magin nisaekavama sathunge subhasadhanaya ihalama pramukhataavaya bavata sathun samaga waeda karana pudgalayin wetha prabala panividayak labaadhenu aetha.""  This translates to ""CCTV footage has become important in prioritizing animal welfare, and provides strong evidence against people interacting with animals.""

The question asks what the RSPCA inspector mentioned as being helpful in investigations. The passage clearly links the CCTV cameras to providing evidence and improving animal welfare, making it the answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: sathun samaga vaeda karana onaema kenek (someone interacting with animals)** - While the CCTV footage *shows* people interacting with animals, the footage itself is the investigative tool.
*   **C: nireekshana sthaapanayan (surveillance installations)** - This is too general. The specific *footage* from the CCTV is key.
*   **D: satva ghatakagara (slaughterhouses)** -  The passage mentions slaughterhouses initially, but the focus of the RSPCA inspector's statement is on the use of CCTV footage in general, not specifically within slaughterhouses.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, ostreliyaanu satva ghaathakaagara kamkaruwanta sathwa subhasadhanaye vaedgathkama thahawuru kirimata upakaaree wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: CCTV kaemara sthaapanaya kirima (Installing CCTV cameras)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that installing CCTV cameras is *compulsory* for slaughterhouses in Australia, and that this is to improve animal welfare. David O'Shannessy (RSPCA principal inspector) is quoted saying CCTV allows for stronger penalties against people who mistreat animals.  The entire focus of the passage revolves around this implementation and its purpose.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: RSPCA samaga anivarya hamuvim (Compulsory agreement with RSPCA):** While the RSPCA is involved in oversight, the passage doesn't say *agreement* with them is compulsory, rather their inspections are important.
* **C: nithipatha satva ghaathakaagara pareekshaa kirima (Regular slaughterhouse inspections):** Inspections are mentioned, but the *installation of CCTV* is presented as the key new action.
* **D: ABC adheekshanaya (ABC oversight):**  ABC is just the news source reporting the information, not a requirement for improving animal welfare.

"mema chedayata anuwa, ath adanguwata gath pudgalayaage raekiyaawa kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: goth‍rika sabhapathiwarayek** (tribal chairperson).

The passage specifically states: ""...red lake gothrika sabaapathi floyid jordayinge 16 haeviridi put luwee jordan bavaya.""  This translates to ""...Red Lake tribal chairperson Floyd Jorday's 16-year-old son, Jordan Bawa.""

Therefore, the individual connected to the event and discussed in the passage is the tribal chairperson.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: shish‍yayaku (student):** The passage doesn't mention a student.
*   **B: minnaepolis star-tribiyun madhyawediyek (Minneapolis Star-Tribune reporter):** The *Star-Tribune* is the source of information, not the person at the center of the event.
*   **D: red lek adhikaariyak (Red Lake official):** While the tribal chairperson *is* an official, the passage specifically identifies them as the *chairperson*.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...winditayin **nava denagen** tidenekuge avamangalya uthsavaya samaga ada red lake prajaava thula pravruthi paetira giyeya.""  This translates to ""...with the new (Windithayin's) ninth day of celebration along with the Red Lake community's full participation.""

The question asks about the timing related to the gathering, specifically referencing Windithayin's day. The passage clearly indicates it's the **nawa deneku** (ninth day) of Windithayin.

This translates to: ""Last month, protests were held in Poland regarding the ACTA agreement, and the Polish government decided not to allow the state to ratify the agreement.""

This clearly indicates Poland is the country that responded to protests by deciding *not* to ratify the ACTA agreement.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, ACTA ha sambandha vime kriyaawaliya kal daemeemata theeranaya kale pahatha sandahan ratawal athurin kawareda?","The correct answer is **D: laetwiyaawa (Latvia)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...adhika lesa rath woo dosha sahitha ayipod 60 k pamana vaartha wee aetha."" which translates to ""...an incident occurred with a high rate of errors affecting 60k people.""

Therefore, the answer is **C: 6**. (The ""60k"" in the text refers to 60,000 people - the closest option provided). However, the text also contains other numbers relating to reports and investigations (27, 34). But the question specifically asks about those *affected* by the errors.
"
adhika lesa rath vime siduvima etharam barapathala ekak nowana bawa keewe kawuda?,"The correct answer is **D: aepal samagama** (Apple company).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""samaagama visin eya """"barapathala novena"""" lesa haedinvu bavayi."" (It was reportedly described as a ""non-apology"" by the company.)
* This directly links the ""barapathala novena"" (non-apology) to the *samaagama* (company), which refers to Apple in this context.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: METI:**  METI (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry) is mentioned as the entity receiving the report, not the one issuing the non-apology.
* **B: sambandhitha aipod himikaruwan:** (Relevant iPod users) They are affected, but don't *issue* the statement.
* **C: japana gini nivime departhamenthuwa:** (Japan Fair Trade Commission) Not mentioned in connection with the non-apology.

"ohuge kathawa atharathura, steev jobs aepal naewatha soyaa gaeneemata yana bawa paewasuwe kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: ithihasaya (history)**.

Here's why:

* **P's statement** includes the phrase """"ada aepal visin durakathanaya naewatha soyagenimatayi soodaanam wanne, api ada **ithihasaya nirmaanaya kirimatayi yanne**"""" which translates to ""this is not just an Apple story, but a creation of **history**.""
* **Q's question** asks what Steve Jobs and Apple were creating.
* The statement directly links their work to the creation of history.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: durakathanaya (story)** - While it *is* a story, the quote emphasizes something bigger than just a story.
* **C: samagama (society)** - While Apple impacted society, that's not the direct focus of the quote.
* **D: thaakshanaya (strength)** - Strength isn't the primary idea expressed in the quote.



"
steev jobsge paeya dekaka kathawe aramuna wuye kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: nawa durakathanayak diyath kirima** (talking about creating a new legend).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** states Steve Jobs said: """"ada aepal visin durakathanaya naewatha soyagenimatayi soodaanam wanne, api ada ithihasaya nirmaanaya kirimatayi yanne"""" which translates to ""We are going to create a new legend with Apple, and we are going to make history.""
* **Q (the question)** asks what Steve Jobs' speech was mainly about.
* **Option C** directly reflects the content of his quote - creating a *new legend* (durakathanaya).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: nawa taeblatayak diyath kirima** (talking about creating a new tablet) - While Apple made tablets, the quote isn't specifically about that.
* **B: nawa pariganakayak diyath kirima** (talking about creating a new computer) - Similar to A, it's too specific.
* **D: ohuge wishrama yaama pilibandawa daenumdeema** (talking about his retirement) -  The quote doesn't mention retirement at all.



"
aajantina wedikaawe dee kristina fernaendas di kirchnar niwedanaya kale kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: aege janadhipathiwarana apek‍shakathwaya** (to announce her candidacy for president).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...iye sandyave aege janadhipati apekshakathvaya nivedana kaala ya."" which directly translates to ""...she announced her candidacy for president at that time.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: senet sabhawa sandaha tharaga kirimata wu aege abhip‍raya** (her opinion regarding the senate session) - While the passage mentions her role in the senate, the *focus* of the announcement was not about the senate session itself.
* **C: buwanos ayares palaath niyojitha kandayama sandaha aege maethiwarana p‍rachaaraka wyaaparaya** (the promotional campaign for the Buenos Aires planned complex) - This refers to an earlier event in 2005, not the announcement she made at the time of the passage.
* **D: wathman senet sabhika dhurayen illa asvime aege saelaesuma** (her challenge to the current senate president) - The passage doesn't mention a challenge to the senate president.



"
kristina fernaendas di kirchnar janadhipathiwaranayata tharaga kirimata wu aege abhip‍raya niwedanaya kale koheda?,"The correct answer is **A: la plata walin saethapum 31k aethin pihiti ragahalaka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...buvanors aires sita kilometres 50 k (saethapum 31 k) durin pihiti lae platavedi, iye sandyave aege janadhipati apekshakathvaya nivedana kaala ya."" This translates to ""...she announced her presidential candidacy from a platform located 50 km from Buenos Aires (approximately 31 km from La Plata).""

Therefore, she made the announcement from a location near La Plata.  The other options are incorrect as they either mention Buenos Aires only or incorrectly relate the distances.



"
big b‍radar sambandhayen ACMA hi soyaagaeneem monavada?,"The correct answer is **A: varana neethi ullanghanaya kara nomaetha** (meaning: does not violate privacy policy).

Here's why:

* **The original text (P) explicitly states:** ""big brather visin maargagata anthargatha vaarana niti ullanghanaya kara nomaeti bhava acma visin soyaa ganna ladi"" which translates to ""Big Brother doesn't violate the privacy policy, and that is what makes it trustworthy.""
* **Question (Q) asks:** What does ACMA say about Big Brother?
* **Option A** directly answers this question by stating Big Brother *doesn't* violate the privacy policy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** Mentions the website advertising, but doesn't address ACMA's opinion.
* **C:**  A shorter, incomplete version of A, lacking the ""does not"" element.
* **D:** Refers to physical safety, which isn't the main point of the text regarding ACMA and Big Brother.



"

Here's why:

* **The Passage (P)** clearly states: ""...bhautikava sarvarayaka pihitiya yuthu ya."" This translates to ""it is a power that physically affects everyone.""  The passage is discussing the broad impact of internet development and the potential for abuse, ultimately affecting people in the real world.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eya antharjalaye wikaashayakara thibiya yuthuya** (It is the power that prevents internet development) - The passage discusses development, not prevention.
* **C: eya web adawiyaka gabada kala nohaeka** (It is not the problem of web advertising) - The passage *starts* by mentioning web advertising, implying it's *part* of the problem.
* **D: ACMA wisin anumatha kala yuthuya** (It is the power permitted by ACMA) - While ACMA is mentioned regarding regulation, the core of the passage is about a broader, pervasive force.



Therefore, option B best reflects the central point made in the passage about the real-world impact of internet-related issues."
ostreliyaanu libaral pak‍shaye nayakayaa kawuda?,"The correct answer is **B: jon hovad**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ostreliyanu bhandagarika saha liberal paksha naayakaya lesa, boho vita agamaeti john howardge anupraaptikaya weemata ida aethi...""  This translates to ""As the Australian treasurer and liberal party leader, many benefits were received by John Howard...""

Therefore, John Howard is identified as the leader of the Liberal party in the text.

* **The passage states:** ""Aarthikamaya washayen nyashtika balashakthi uthpadanaye haekiyaavak aethi woo vita ostreliyava eya digata ma bhavitha kala yuthu bhava kostelo mahatha paewaseeya. 'eya vaanijya wanne nam, api eya labaa gatha yutuyi. enam nyashtika balashakthiya sambandhava muladhaarmika virodhataavak naetha' kostelo mahatha paewasuwe ya."" This translates to something along the lines of: ""Kostelo strongly believes that Australia should not be involved in the production of destructive power economically. 'If it's a trade opportunity, we will profit from it. There is no fundamental contradiction regarding this destructive power' Kostelo said.""
* **This indicates:**  Kostelo views destructive power as a potential *economic opportunity* if it can be traded. He doesn't see it as a social welfare issue or something needing public assistance.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: itha mathabhedathmaka deyak vima (it is a matter of religious difference):** The passage doesn't discuss religion.
    * **C: itha anathurudayaka vima (it is a matter of misfortune):** The passage frames it as an economic/trade issue, not something resulting from misfortune.
    * **D: itha mila adhika vima (it is a matter of rights):** While rights could *potentially* be involved, the passage focuses on economic benefit and trade.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the text is that Kostelo does *not* see destructive power as a matter of public assistance."
margopadeshaka upakaarayen tharaga kala skee kreedaka kawuda?,"The correct answer is **C: mesig k‍resal**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Polantaye drushyaabaadhitha ski kridaka masieg kresell siya manga penwaniya wana aena ogarinska samaga pirimi super-jee hee dahatun waennata sampurna kale ya."" This translates to ""Polish visually impaired ski athlete Masieg Kresell completed the super-G with the guidance of Aena Ogarinska.""

Therefore, Masieg Kresell is the visually impaired ski athlete who used a guide. The question asks for the ski athlete.



"
kaantha hiti supar-ji panthiye dhawana sthaanaya labaa gath rata kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: nedarlanthaya**.

Here's how we find that in the text:

The text states: ""...super-jee kaantha panthiye navaveniya lesa avasan kala aena josemsen sitina **nedarlanthaya** saha ema isavvema dahavaeniyaa lesa avasan kala katjaa saarinen sitina finlanthaya aetulatya.""

This translates to ""...the super-jee women's team finished in the newly arrived position in the Netherlands with josemsen, and the other finished in the last position with katjaa saarinen from Finland.""

Therefore, the Netherlands (nedarlanthaya) is where the women's super-jee team finished in a new position.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ema sthaanayedi ath adanguvata path woo idiripath karannaa..."" This directly translates to ""He will take steps to prevent anyone from entering that place.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ohu paharadeema piligaththeya** (He was frightened by the guard) -  The passage describes him *creating* a protective atmosphere, not being afraid.
* **C: ohu paharadeeme dee pollak bhawitha kaleya** (He felt a lot of emotion due to the guard) -  The passage focuses on his actions and the security he provides, not his personal feelings.
* **D: bothal thama wetha wisikaranu laebu bawa ohu kiyaa sitiyeya** (He did it to clarify his position) - While there's mention of authority, the passage's immediate focus is on securing the location.



Therefore, **A** is the most direct and accurate answer based on the provided text."
"mema chedayata anuwa, blekta sidu nowuye pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: adhikarana kriyaawaliya mulaa kirimata uthsaha kirima sambandhayen ohu vaeradikaru wiya** (He is involved in encouraging the implementation of court procedures).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** states: ""Adhikarana kriyaavaliya mulaa kirimata uthsaha kireema sambandhavada bleik vaeradikaru karana ladi.""  This directly translates to ""He is doing work related to encouraging the implementation of court procedures.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ohu ath adanguwata ganna ladee** (He is going to the place to investigate) - The passage mentions he *is at* a place, but not *going to* investigate.
* **C: ohuta pollakin pahara dena ladee** (He is giving security to them) - While security is mentioned in the passage, it's not what *he* is doing. He's being *protected* because of his work.
* **D: ohuta ohu sirayata yawanu aethi bawa pawasanu laebeeya** (He will be able to bring them to trial) - The passage mentions a rule called """"hudekma novaelakiya haekkak"""" relating to his arrest, but not about bringing anyone to trial.



Therefore, option **A** is the most accurate reflection of what the passage states about Bleik's activities."

* **P's text** states: ""Ganvathurata oroththu dena nivaasa, vadaa yahapath jala kalamanaakaranaya saha **boga vividhaangikaranaya** sandahaa mudal yedaviya haekiya.""  This translates to ""Providing rural housing, water resource management, and **livelihood diversification** were key priorities.""
* **Q's question** asks what priority was considered when helping countries lacking strength due to ethnic conflicts.
* **P's text** connects livelihood diversification (boga vividhaangikaranaya) as a priority alongside rural housing and water management.  Diversifying livelihoods would help reduce conflict by lessening economic competition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: sanwardhanaya wemin pawathina jaatheenta thaakshanaya raegena ema** (strengthening countries by promoting constitutional rule of law) - While important, it's not the *specific* thing mentioned in connection to helping weaker nations in the text.
* **C: ganwathurata oroththu dena nivasa** (providing rural housing) - This is a priority, but not specifically linked to assisting nations lacking strength.
* **D: goleeya ushnathwaya ihala yaamen aethiwana balapaem samanaya kirima** (bringing ethnic conflicts to a high level and making strength equal) - This describes a problem, not a solution proposed in the text.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
"mema chedayata anuwa, eksath janapadaya aarakshaa kirimata balaporoththu wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: thaakshanaya beda gaeneema haraha mudal**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P)** states ""...thaaksanayan bedaadima aethulat we."" which translates to ""it was established to prevent oppression.""  It also mentions strengthening forces to help villages (""ratawalata thaaksanayan bedaadima aethulat we""). This directly links to providing security and protection.
* **The question (Q)** asks what is used to strengthen forces to protect the population.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: boga** (goods) - While mentioned in the passage regarding diversification, it doesn't directly relate to strengthening forces for protection.
* **C: ithiriwa aethi vaesi vananthara** (small islands and forests) -  This refers to the geography, not the methods of protection.
* **D: durwala jala kalamanakaranaya nisawen peedawata path janathawa** (suffering from drought due to improper water management) - This describes a *problem* addressed in the passage, not a solution for strengthening forces.



Therefore, **thaakshanaya beda gaeneema haraha mudal** (preventing oppression) is the action taken that strengthens forces to protect the people, as described in the passage."

The passage states: ""Benin da sahabhaagi wana bhava AU hi velenda saha karmaantha komasaris albert muchangaa daenum dunneya.""  This directly translates to ""Benin was among those participating and the acting commissioner Albert Muchanga announced it.""

The question asks *why* Albert Muchanga gave the statement. The passage indicates he announced Benin's participation in the AfCFTA. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: welandama aarambha kala haeki dinaya (The date the agreement started)** - The date (July 1, 2020) is mentioned, but isn’t *why* Muchanga made the statement.
* **C: mularambhaka neethi (Initial policies)** - The passage mentions policies are being discussed, but this isn't the direct reason for the announcement.
* **D: badu sahana (Financial support)** -  Financial support is mentioned as a topic of discussion, but doesn’t explain why Muchanga made the statement.

* **The passage states:** ""...2020, juuli 1 dina sita velandaama aarambha kireema sandahaa apata aethi raamuva pramanavath wana baev komasaarisvaraya paewaseeya.""  This translates to ""...the agreement began on July 1st, 2020, as confirmed by the Commissioner.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** Focuses on policies and support, not the *date* of the agreement.
* **C:** Mentions the AU and the Commissioner, but doesn't specify the start date.
* **D:** Discusses policies and support, again not the start date.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""In madha kaalayak aevaemen, aetlantave jarnala-vyavasthava visin parikshana pratiphalayanhi gaetalu penwana vaartavak prakaashayata path karana ladi. Vaartaven pennum kale parikshana lakunu aedahiya nohaeki lesa itha ihala goss aethi bawath, paasala abyantarava gaetalu handunaagath namuth eva sambandhayen kriyaa nokala bawath ya."" 

This translates to: ""During this period, they continued to publish articles reflecting exam results within the Atlanta journal system. Even though rumors of cheating on the exams were spreading, they did **not take any action** regarding internal issues within the schools.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: jarnal-kanstitiyshan vaarthawa wikurthi kirima** (distorting news within the journal system) - The passage doesn't say the news was distorted, only that it was *published*.
* **B: nagarika adhyaapanaya nawyakaranaya kirimata apohosath vima** (failure to restructure civic education) - This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **D: adu pareekshana lakunu vaartha kirima** (reporting on exam results) - This is *what* they did, not what they *failed* to do. The question asks about what the journal-constitution *didn't* do.

"mema chedaye sandahan thorathuru walata anuwa, aetlanta jarnal-kanstitiyshan vaarthawe sandahan nowanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: pareekshana path‍rikaa magadiyak vi aethi bawata saak‍shi** (Evidence that examination papers were leaked to the media).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""In madha kaalayak aevaemen, aetlantave jarnala-vyavasthava visin parikshana pratiphalayanhi gaetalu penwana vaartavak prakaashayata path karana ladi.""  This translates to ""During this period, news reports began to appear revealing examination content through the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.""

This directly indicates that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution published information about leaked exam papers.  The passage further suggests a concern about evidence (saakshi) related to this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: asaaman‍ya lesa pareekshana lakunu ihala yaama** (Abnormally high examination scores) - While the passage mentions concerns about exam results, it doesn't specifically link it to abnormally *high* scores, but rather irregularities.
* **C: 2013 jaathika pareekshaawariya sammanaya** (2013 National Examination Award) -  This refers to an award received, not the leak itself.
* **D: naagarika adhyaapanaya nawyakaranaya kirima sandaha yojana** (Citizenship teaching curriculum investigation plan) - This is a separate issue mentioned in the passage, unrelated to the exam leak.

mema chedayata anuwa bomba p‍raharayen pasuwa daenagatha haeki wu thorathuru monavada?,"The correct answer is **D: nila marana sankyaawa (number of deaths)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""...පායෑ දෙකක කාලයක් තුළ රාජයේ ගොඩනැඟිලි අසල තවත් බෝම්බයක් පිපිරුන යා. සමහර වාර්ථා මඟින් නිල වශයෙන මිහිගිය සංඛ්‍යාව අටක් ලෙස දැක්වෙන අතර, නිල වාර්ථා මඟින් 30 දෙනෙකු තුවාල ලැබූ බව වාර්ථා කරනා...""

Out of the options, only the number of deaths is explicitly stated in the passage. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: thuvala laebu ayage awasan sankyaawa (number of injured)** - While the passage mentions 30 injured, the question is asking for *all* information given, and death toll is a crucial piece of information.
* **B: bomba pupura giye kumana godanaegili asala da yana bawa (where the bomb exploded near government buildings)** - The passage states it was near government buildings, but doesn’t specify *which* building.
* **C: thawath amathara bomba pupurava haereemata thibeda yana bawa (that more bomb explosions are expected)** - The passage does *not* mention any expectation of future explosions.

This translates to ""Gabriel Jesus joined Manchester City in January 2017 for 27 million.""  It then says he played 24 matches and scored 53 goals.

Therefore, the answer is **A: 24**."
kumana kreeda samajayata ek vima sandaha pavum miliyana 27 ka gasthuwak jesusta laebuneda?,"The correct answer is **A: paelmiyaras**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Vaarthagatha pavum 27 miliyanayak gaasthuvak sandahaa **brasiliyaanu club paelmiyaras** hi..."" (The news says that a deal worth 27 million was struck with the Brazilian club Palmeiras...).  It goes on to mention Jesus moving *from* Palmeiras *to* Manchester City.

The question asks which club was involved in a 27 million deal for Jesus. Therefore, Palmeiras is the correct answer.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Deshiya welaawen ada ude 10 ta pamana islaamaye pujaniya nagaraya wana makkamahi nevaasikaagarayak kadaa vaetini.""  This directly translates to: ""A resident is preparing to go to the holy city of Mecca within the next 10 days.""
* **The passage also mentions:** ""Hajj vandanaa gamana sandahaa pujaniya nagaraya wetha paemini wandanakaruwan gananavak mema godanaegille navaathaengena sitiyaha."" This reinforces the preparation for Hajj (the pilgrimage to Mecca).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: samahara amuththo desheeya puravaesiyan nowuha** (All residents are new immigrants) - The passage only mentions *one* resident preparing for Hajj and indicates they have been there for some time. It also mentions the resident coming *from* the UAE, implying they are not a new immigrant to the area.
* **C: haj dinata pera sawasa amuththan ehi sitiyaha** (The resident lives here all year for Hajj) - The passage doesn't state this. It simply states they are *preparing* to go.
* **D: amuththangen bahutharaya shuddha nagaraye sita paemini ayayi** (The resident has been sent to many holy cities) - The passage focuses solely on Mecca.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate reflection of the information provided in the text."
"mema chedayata anuwa, pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashawalin niwaeredi wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: siyaluma amuththan eksath arabi emeer rajyaye sita paemini ayayi** (roughly translates to: ""almost all the deceased were sent from the United Arab Emirates"").

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""nevaasikaagaraye amuththan boho durata eksath arabi emir rajyaye puravaesiyan vuha"" (The deceased of the residential area were largely transported from the United Arab Emirates).  This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kisiweku miya giye naetha** (no one went there) - The passage clearly states people went on Hajj.
* **C: haj wandna gamanata pera sawasa amuththan ehi sitiyaha** (the deceased were accommodated for the Hajj pilgrimage) - This is the opposite of what the passage says; the deceased *came from* the UAE, not were accommodated for Hajj.
* **D: amuththangen bahutharaya makkaa p‍radeshavaseen wiya** (many of the deceased were residents of Mecca) - The passage indicates they were *brought from* the UAE, not that they were local to Mecca.

"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, gaeteema pilibanda awinishchitha nowana thorathuru kawaredaa?","The correct answer is **A: gaeteeme wishalathwaya** (the vastness of the garden).

Here's why:

The passage repeatedly emphasizes the *size* and *vastness* of the garden (""vishaala ekak woo bavata,"" ""vishaalatvaya saha emagin pruthuwiyata vanu aethi balapaema""). The people are motivated to explore and understand its extent. 

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: gaeteeme sthaanaya** (the location of the garden): While location is implied, it's not the central focus of the passage.
* **C: pruthiwiya matha ema gaeteeme balapaema** (the earth and the power of that garden): The earth is mentioned as a reference point for the garden's size, but the *power* of the garden isn't discussed.
* **D: sunbun wala pihiteema** (what is hidden in the bun): This is a completely irrelevant detail and doesn't relate to the main topic of the passage.



Therefore, the passage's main concern is describing and pondering the **vastness of the garden**."
"mema chedayata anuwa, mema gaeteema sambandhayen thawamath theeranaya kala yuthu de wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: wishleshanaye p‍rathiphala beda ganna aakaaraya** (the area to determine the results of the analysis).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on measuring the area of the garden (gaetima).** It mentions calculating its length and width (dekehima bara raaththal 1000 ta wadi wana, payakata saethapum 17,500 ka wegayen gaman ganimin thibu chandrikaa dekama pruthuwiye sita saethapum 491 kata udadee ekineka haa gaetini).  The ultimate goal is to understand the garden's size and its relationship to the Earth.
* **The phrase ""Vishleshanaye prathiphalaya podu web adaviyaka pala karanu laebe""** directly translates to ""the results of the analysis will be based on the area.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sunbun luhubaendeema palanaya karanne kawuda** (who is conducting the survey regarding sunbun) -  The passage mentions sunbun, but it doesn't ask *who* is doing the survey, just that information is being obtained from it.
* **B: gaetena awasthaawe dee chandrikaa ketharam wegayen gaman karamin sitiyeda** (whether Chandrika went around the garden in a certain way) - This is a detail about a specific action (Chandrika's walk) but not the *main question* about what they are trying to determine.
* **D: binda vaeteeme nishchitha parimanaya** (a definite quantity of the bin) - This is completely unrelated to the passage's content.



Therefore, the passage is primarily concerned with calculating the garden's area to analyze its characteristics and relation to the Earth, making **C** the most accurate answer."
"mema chedayata anuwa, baetan warak dhanawathma aemarikaanuwange laeyisthuwe athkaragena siti sthaanaya kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: 190 vaeni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...2008 dee dhanavatma aemarikaanuvan 400 denaa athara baetan **190 veni sthaanaya** labaa gaththe ya.""  This directly translates to ""...in 2008 the wealthy American ranked **190th** among the 400 richest.""

Therefore, the question asking for his position on the list is answered by 190."
baetan parith‍yaaga kale pahatha sandahan ewayin kawarak sandaha da?,"The question asks about what the American millionaire studied. The passage states he received a degree from the University of Virginia's College of Arts and Sciences in 1950.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: warjiniyaa wishwa widyaalaya** (University of Virginia).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: dhanawathma aemarikaanuwange laeyisthuwa** (The American millionaire's list) - This refers to a ranking, not his education.
*   **C: saelakiya yuthu aayathana sankyaawak** (Number of sales revenue institutions) - This relates to his later career, not his education.
*   **D: kala ha widyaa sandaha wu widyaala** (The college of arts and sciences) - This is *part* of the University of Virginia, but the question asks *where* he studied, not *what* he studied within the university."

Here's why:

* **P's statement** details a situation where Arnold Schwarzenegger is prosecuting someone for illegally selling violent video games to minors in California, and potentially facing a $1000 fine.
* **Q's question** asks what Arnold Schwarzenegger is doing in relation to this situation.
* **Option A** (""Californiaawa pura bala wayaskaruwanta darunu vidiyo kreeda wikineema ho kuliyata deema thahanam kirima"") directly translates to ""prosecuting those who sell violent video games to minors in California,"" which is exactly what Schwarzenegger is doing according to P.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: waradkaruwan sandaha mudalin dada** - This means ""giving money to criminals,"" which isn't what Schwarzenegger is doing.
* **C: kaelifoniyaawen pitatha bala wayaskaruwanta darunu vidiyo kreeda wikineema ho kuliyata deema thahanam kirima** - This is very similar to A, but ""pitatha"" (father) is unnecessary and doesn't accurately reflect the general nature of prosecuting *anyone* selling to minors.
* **D: darunu vidiyo kreeda sandaha dekaal awashyathawayak** - This means ""violent video game investigation is necessary"" - it describes a need, not Schwarzenegger's action.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, kiyanu labana dewal maga haeriye kawuda?","The correct answer is **D: dooval**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) refers to a ""doovalge daruvan"" (dooval's child) being involved in a marriage. The question (Q) asks who the passage is *about*.  The entire passage centers around ""dooval"" and his family/situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: doovalge daruvan** - This is *a part* of the story, but not the main focus. The question asks *who* the story is about, not *a character within* the story.
*   **B: maik** - ""Maik"" is mentioned briefly in a quote, but isn't central to the narrative.
*   **C: milar** - ""Milar"" is only mentioned once at the end and appears to be who is speaking about ""dooval"" not the subject *of* the story.

"mema chedayata anuwa, nadu wibhagaye dee milarge athdaekeem pilibanda sath‍ya wanne pahatha sandahan karunu walin monavada?","The correct answer is **B: ohu sudanam wemin sitiya dee ohu awadhaanaya yomu kale naetha.**

Here's why:

* **The Passage (P)** describes Miller being overwhelmed and unable to focus. He says he can't even pay attention to the city he's in (Wemin City) let alone Pavasamin City.  The core of his problem is a lack of attention.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: nadu wibhagaye dee dooval milar kerehi haegeemak aethi kaleya:** This translates to ""The country's marriage to Miller is not a good thing."" The passage doesn't focus on Miller's marriage, but his mental state.
* **C: doovalge daruvan dedena nadu wibhagaye dee boho de pilibandawa katha kalaha:**  This means ""The country discusses the marriage of the groom."" Again, the passage isn't about the marriage itself.
* **D: ohu doovalge kathawa kerehi daedi awadhaanayak yomu karamin sitiyeya:** This means ""He is trying to pay attention to the groom's story, but he can't."" While he *wants* to pay attention, the passage emphasizes his *inability* to do so.

**Option B** directly reflects Miller's statement that he can't focus on Wemin City, let alone anything else – showing a lack of attention.  Therefore, it is the most accurate answer.



"
'pirisidu vaya panatha' sanshodhanaya kala yuthu bawata yojana kale kawuda?,"The correct answer is **C: Jaek Leyton**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...rajaye 'pirisidu vayu panatha' eya devana vaara kiyavimata pera, siyalu paksha kamituva wetha samalochanaya sandahaa yaevimata ekagha wee thibe.""  This translates to ""...the country's 'pirisidu vayu panatha' was presented by **Jack Leyton** and all parties agreed to discuss it...""

Therefore, Jack Leyton is the one who presented the 'pirisidu vayu panatha' for consideration.



"
“pirisidu vayu panatha” purwa maethiwarana p‍rodawak lesa bhawitha karana bawa wu wiwechanaya p‍rathik‍shepa kale kawuda?,"The correct answer is **B: agamaethiwarayaku** (the Prime Minister's Office).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...rajaye 'pirisidu vayu panatha' eya **devana vaara kiyavimata pera**, siyalu paksha kamituva wetha samalochanaya sandahaa yaevimata ekagha wee thibe.""  This translates to ""...the nation's 'pirisidu vayu panatha' was said by **the Prime Minister's Office** and all parties agreed to a one-day discussion...""

Therefore, the Prime Minister's Office is the entity that initially presented or ""brought forth"" the ""pirisidu vayu panatha"".



"
balalunge muth‍ra wala sayanurik amlaya saha melamain sanyoga antharkriyaa karana wita aethi wanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: wakugadu (vaccination)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vishvavidyaalaye paryeshakayan pawasuwe, ndeka ekineka prathikriyaa kara, **vakugadu kriyaakarithvaya avahira karana sphatika saedhana bavay**.""  This translates to: ""University researchers conducted several reactions, using crystal solutions that utilize a **vaccination** mechanism.""

The passage describes researchers using crystal solutions to study the interaction between cyanuric acid and melamine found in animal urine, stemming from contaminated food.  The *method* they used to create and manipulate these crystals involved a vaccination-like process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: surathal sathunge aahara (contaminated food)**: This is the *source* of the problem (the contamination leading to the urine samples) but not the method of interaction study.
* **C: sphatika (crystals)**: Crystals are what they *used* for the study, not the interaction method itself.
* **D: adhoraktha warnawaleekshanaya (FTIR spectroscopy)**: This is a *tool* they used to *analyze* the crystals, not the interaction process.



"
adhoraktha warnawaleekshanaya bhawitha karamin paryeshakayan nireekshanaya kale kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: surathal sathwa muth‍rawala sphatika sanyuthiya** (crystals of surathal sathwa urine).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Adhorakta varnaavaliksanaya (FTIR) mangin sansandanaya kala vita daknata labune mema sphatikavala samyutiya balapaemata lakvu surathal sathunge muthravalin hamu woo sphatikavalata samaana bavay.""  This translates to: ""FTIR analysis showed similarities between the composition of these crystals and crystals found in the urine of animals fed surathal sathwa.""

Therefore, the FTIR analysis (a type of infrared spectroscopy - *adhoraktha warnawaleekshanaya*) helped the researchers identify the crystals as being related to *surathal sathwa muthrawala sphatika sanyuthiya*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: wakugadu kriyaakaarithwaya (crystal structure):** While crystal structure *was* observed, the FTIR analysis specifically identified the *composition* related to the urine.
*   **C: balapaemata lak wu surathal sathun (surathal sathwa with strong properties):** This is a vague description and not what the FTIR directly revealed.
*   **D: dooshanayata lak wu surathal sathwa aahara (surathal sathwa contaminated food):** The passage doesn't mention contamination, only the source of the surathal sathwa.



"
"""luna """"ath‍yantha raejina"""" lesa handunwanu laebuwe kawuda?""","The correct answer is **D: tomi d‍reemar**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tommy dremer pawasuwe, """"lunaa tamay athyantha raejina. mage palamu kalamanaakaariniya."""" "" (Tommy Dremer said, ""Luna is extremely radiant. My first inspiration."")

Therefore, Tommy Dremer is the one who described Luna as ""athyantha raejina"" (extremely radiant).
"
luna “athbhootha” lesa haendinwuye kawuda?,"The correct answer is **B: dastin ranals**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dustin """"goldast"""" runnels adahas daekvuye lunaa maa tharamatama atbhutay... samaharavita itath vadaa...""  This translates to ""Dustin 'Goldast' Runnels saw Luna and said she was the most amazing...""  Therefore, Dustin Runnels is the one who describes Luna as ""athbhootha"" (amazing/wonderful).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: aeyage rasikayin:** The text doesn't mention a fan of hers describing her as amazing.
*   **C: rajaye wimarshakayan:** The royal examiner mentions something about Luna but doesn't describe her as amazing.
*   **D: tomi d‍reemar:** Tommy Dremer compliments Luna, but it's Dustin Runnels who specifically uses the word suggesting Luna is “athbhootha”.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""riyaduraage hisata barapathala thuwaala sidu viya"" which directly translates to ""it fell from the driver's side.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the passage mentions not causing harm to anyone in the house, it doesn't say *it* fell to anyone.
* **C:** This refers to actions *after* the event, not the event itself.
* **D:** This is about a potential future impact, not what *happened* according to the text.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage."
ragbi shoorathawaliye dee dakunu ap‍rikaawe kreedawe kaepee penena kaaranaya wuye kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: aarak‍shaka kusalatha** (defensive skills).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ovunge shikshaakami aarakshaka vidhi, bola kalamanaakaranayehi nipunathaa saha athidaksha kandaayam ekaghathaawa hethuven ovunta raendi siteemata haeki woo athara tharaga kirimata vatinaa kandaayama meya bavata paehaedili vi ya.""  This translates to: ""Due to their coach's defensive strategies, expertise in ball handling, and intense physical conditioning, they were able to withstand the strong waves of attacks and secure a win.""

The passage directly attributes their success to their **defensive skills** (aarakshaka kusalatha). While ball handling and physical conditioning are *part* of being good at rugby, the passage emphasizes the defensive aspect as the key reason they were able to overcome the South African team's strong attacks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kandayamak lesa chamathkaareewa katayuthu kirima** (playing cleverly with the field):  Not specifically mentioned as the primary reason for their win.
* **B: bola haesiravime haekiyaawa** (being skilled at catching the ball): Important, but not the *primary* reason given for their victory.
* **C: tharagawaliya aarambhaye deema wishishta daskam** (a special tactic at the beginning of the game): The passage doesn’t focus on a tactic at the beginning of the game, but a consistent skill set.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, dakunu ap‍rikaawe tharagaya vaedi diyunu vimata patan gaththe kawadadaa?","The correct answer is **D: tharagawaliya idiriyata yathma** (towards the wave's crest).

Here's why:

The passage describes the South African team facing ""atisayin ugra tharangayaka yedemin"" (extremely fierce waves) and how ""tharagavaliye idiriyata yana vita dakunu aprikaava sthaavarava vardhanaya vi ya"" (South Africa strengthened as they moved towards the wave's crest). This clearly indicates they were progressing *towards* the peak of the wave.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: pe.wa. 10:00 ta pamana** (by 10:00 AM) - This is just a time reference, not related to the wave situation.
*   **B: aarakshaawa thara kirimen pasu** (after defending against waves) - The passage doesn't say they were *defending* against waves, but rather facing and navigating them.
*   **C: saembiyaawata parajaya vimen pasuwa** (after losing to Zambia) - The passage mentions a win *against* South Africa, not a loss *to* Zambia.

"mema chedayata anuwa, chinaye aarthikaya niwaerediwa pilibimbu nokaranne pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashawalin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: chinayata eksath janapadayata wada wishala dala desheeya nishpadithayak labaa gatha haekiya** (China benefited from a large increase in domestic production for its population).

Here's why:

* **The passage highlights China's economic growth, particularly its domestic production.** It states that within a decade, China's domestic production exceeded that of the United States. This is the central theme of the passage's economic success story.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: prathisanskarana sidu kirimen pasuwa chinaye aarthikaya sheegrayen wardhanaya vi thibe** (Economic growth accelerated after economic reforms) - While true, this is a *cause* of the benefit, not the benefit itself.  The passage *mentions* the reforms, but doesn't focus on them as the primary outcome.
* **B: eksath janapadayata wada wishala motar ratha apanayanaya welandapolak chinayata aetha** (China became a large importer of automobiles from the United States) - The passage states China *surpassed* Germany in motor vehicle production; it doesn't say they imported a lot *from* the US. This is actually the opposite of what's stated.
* **D: chinaye vahana apanayanaya kisi witekath germaniya ikmava naetha** (Germany was never ahead of China in vehicle imports) -  This is irrelevant to the main point of the passage, which is China's economic growth.



Therefore, option C best reflects the key takeaway from the passage – that China's economic prosperity was driven by a massive increase in its own production."
"mema chedayata anuwa, chinaye dala desheeya nishpadithaya eksath janapadaye dala desheeya nishpadithaya ikmava yaa haekke kawadada?","The correct answer is **B: dashaka dekak thula** (over a decade).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dashaka dekakin chinaye dhala deshiya nishpadithaya eksath janapadayata vadaa vishaala weemata ida atha.""  This directly translates to ""Over a decade, China's total domestic production exceeded that of the United States.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: thawath aarthika prathisanskarana sidu kirimen pasuwa** (following economic reforms) - This is a *cause* of the growth, not the *timeframe* in which it occurred.
*   **C: rata nawa nayakathwayak aethi wita** (with a new national leadership) - Again, this is a factor *related* to the changes, but not the time it took.
*   **D: dashaka thunak thula** (over a decade) - This is very similar to the correct answer, but 'dekak' specifically implies 'ten', making 'dashaka dekak thula' more precise in this context based on the passage.

The text states: ""Hoo sanvardhanaya vemin pawathina ratawalata dirigaenvuye """"palamuwa dushanaya weeme ha pasuwa pirisidu kireeme paerani maavatha maga haerimata"""" ya.""  This translates to ""He directed the country on a path of 'reducing pollution and recovering lost lands for future generations.'""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: owunge sanwardhana adiyaren obbata yana wagakeem bhara gaeneema** (carry the burden of their development under their guidance) - This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **B: aarthika nimaewuma kerehi awadhaanaya yomu kirima** (give priority to economic rules) - While economic considerations are alluded to, the primary focus is on environmental sustainability.
* **C: owunge warthamana wagakeem walin obbata yaama** (go with their current methods) - The text emphasizes *changing* direction towards sustainability, not continuing the current path.



"
hoo wisin sandahan nokarana ladde kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: dooshanaya sambandhayen sanwardhanaya wemin pawathina ratawalata upades** (Advice to countries prioritizing development even with pollution).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hoo sanvardhanaya vemin pawathina ratawalata dirigaenvuye """"palamuwa dushanaya weeme ha pasuwa pirisidu kireeme paerani maavatha maga haerimata"""" ya.""  This translates to ""He directed countries prioritizing development even with pollution, saying """"a path of rapid growth that allows pollution and ignores animal protection."""" ""

This directly indicates he is advising/directing countries who choose development *despite* pollution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: adu kirima sandaha wu padanama** (The reduction of emissions is not important) - The passage doesn't say reduction isn't important, but acknowledges countries *may* prioritize growth over it.
*   **C: kaaban wimochanaya adu wana bawata balaporoththu wana dinayak** (A day allocated to offsetting carbon emissions) - This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: kaaban wimochanaya adu kirima sambandha sankyaathmaka daththa** (Statistical data related to reducing carbon emissions) - The passage doesn’t focus on data, but on the *choice* countries make.



"

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What organization did Virman speak for when making the statement?
* **The passage states:** ""...Medicines sans frontiere venuven kathaa kala richard virman paewasoowe..."" (Richard Virman spoke on behalf of Medicines sans Frontiere...)
* Therefore, Virman represents **Medicines sans Frontiere**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: aengolawa** -  ""Aengolawa"" (England) is *mentioned* in the passage, but Virman doesn't represent it.
* **C: mangolawa** - ""Mangolawa"" (Mongolia) is not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: loka sawukya sanvidhaanaya** - ""Loka sawukya sanvidhaanaya"" (world health constitution) is a topic mentioned, but not an organization Virman represents.



"
nadu wibhagaya hethuwen huhnege kaebinat thanathura bhara ganu aeththe kawuda?,"The correct answer is **B: staamar**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""prasiddha nadu vibhaaga adyaksha keyar starmer kiv. see. ada udaesana prakaashayak nikuth kale ya.""  This translates to ""prominent regional chairman Keir Starmer K.C. issued this statement.""  The question asks who Huhne's cabinet position is being filled by. The text directly identifies Keir Starmer as taking over the regional chairmanship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: daewe** - Not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: laemb** - Noman Lamb is mentioned as a potential replacement for a different position (Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy).
*   **D: prayis** -  ""Prayis"" appears in the text but relates to the praise being given, not a person taking a cabinet position.



"

Here's why:

The text states: ""vedigen hisvana vyaapara amaathya thanatura parlimenthu manthri **noman laemb** visin labaa ganu aetaeyi apeksaa kere.""  This translates to ""It is expected that Parliament Minister **Noman Laemb** will benefit from the post of Financial and Business Secretary.""

"kaemeele shantha-saenge opera p‍rasangaya atharathura, p‍rasangika idiripath karannan p‍rek‍shakayin dirimath karanne kumak sandaha da?","Let's break down the question and the provided text to determine the correct answer.

**Understanding the Text (P):**

The text (P) describes Kaemil's artistic vision for an opera, focusing on the themes of life and death (""jivath woo"") and involving Japanese and mathematical elements (""mathdrawya saha japaanaya"").  It suggests the opera is designed to create a strong emotional impact on the audience (""preksakayan eyata sambandhaweema unandu karavayi"") through a powerful, evocative performance (""idiripath karannan vedikave dee kansa dumwaeti paanaya karana"").  Essentially, it's about creating a profound experience for the audience.

**Understanding the Question (Q):**

The question (Q) asks *why* Kaemil designed the opera to strongly affect the audience.  What was the purpose behind wanting to deeply move the spectators?

**Analyzing the Answer Options:**

* **A: gansa bhawithayata sahabhagee vima (A shared belief in serious emotions):** This is a possibility, as the text hints at emotional depth, but it doesn’t fully explain *why* Kaemil would aim for that.
* **B: japanayata sanchaaraya kirima (Communicating about Japan):** While Japan is mentioned as an element of the opera, the text doesn't suggest the core purpose is to simply communicate *about* Japan.
* **C: owun samaga wedikaawe raga daekvimata ek vima (Being one with the stage and its feelings):** This seems related to the performance aspect, but doesn't explain the *intention* behind affecting the audience.
* **D: owun aadaraya karana de anuwa owunge jiwitatha theeranaya kirimata ida deema (It is to understand their life by respecting what they admire):** This option connects directly to the opera’s core theme of life and death (""jivath woo"").  The text suggests Kaemil wants to evoke strong emotions to help the audience contemplate their own existence and appreciate life.  The opera is a vehicle for exploring what people value and how that relates to their lives.

**Conclusion:**

The most logical answer is **D: owun aadaraya karana de anuwa owunge jiwitatha theeranaya kirimata ida deema**.  It best reflects the opera’s intent to trigger introspection and a deeper understanding of life through emotional engagement.



"
opera p‍rasangaya atharathura p‍radhaana washayen kansa dumvaeti panaya karanne kawuda?,"The correct answer is **C: p‍rasangika idiripath karannan** (the contextual director).

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""...prasaṅgika idiripath karannan vedikave dee kansa dumwaeti paanaya karana athara ranga shaalava preksakayan eyata sambandhaweema unandu karavayi.""  This directly translates to ""...the contextual director is making arrangements to give a drink of kansa dumwaeti to the audience of eight stages, related to it.""
* **Q asks:** ""...who is making arrangements to give kansa dumwaeti as the main subject of the opera?""

Therefore, the contextual director (p‍rasangika idiripath karannan) is the one performing the action described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kalakaruva (artist):**  The text mentions the artist, but doesn't say *they* are giving the drink.
* **B: p‍ransha p‍rek‍shakayin (Pransha audience):** The audience *receives* the drink, they don't *give* it.
* **D: kaemeele shantha-saenge (Kaemil Shanta-Sange):** Kaemil is the sender of the vision, not the one making the arrangements for the drink.

The text states: ""Vasara dahayakata pasu, ohu abyavakaasa tharagaya avasan woo bavata sanketavat kala aepalo-soyus meheyumata soviyat paarshawayen naayakatvaya dunneya.""  This translates to: ""After ten days, he signaled the end of the space age and took the lead for the Soviet side with the Apollo-Soyuz project.""

The question asks what was indicated when Leonov reached ""the hero of space"". The text directly links that moment to his later leadership in the Apollo-Soyuz project, signifying the end of the initial space race and a new era of cooperation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: abhyawakaasha tharagaya (space age)** - While relevant, it's what was *ending*, not what was indicated by reaching ""hero of space.""
*   **C: abhyawakaasha yaanawen paribahira kriyaakaarakam (first spacewalker)** - This is what he *was*, not what his achievement signaled.
*   **D: 11 veni abyavakaasagamiya (11th space traveler)** - This is a description of him, not the indication of his later achievement.

This directly translates to ""After ten days, he signaled the end of the space age and led the **Apollo-Soyuz mission** on behalf of the Soviet side.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: abhyawakaasha tharagaya (space age)** - This is *what* he signaled the end of, not the entity leading the mission.
*   **C: 11 veni abyavakaasagamiya (11th space traveler)** - This refers to Leonov himself, not the mission.

The passage states: ""Vayasa avurudu 64 k **woo track ratha riyaeduraata** mema gaetimen kisindu thuwaalayak sidu novini.""  This translates to ""A 64-year-old **train driver** received serious injuries.""

Therefore, the question ""anathuren thuvala laebuwe kawuda?"" (Who was injured in the accident?) is answered by ""trak ratha riyadurek.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: gibsan** - Gibson is mentioned as a name but isn't the injured person.
*   **B: garag sewakayek** - (Garage worker) - This isn't mentioned in the text as being involved in the accident.

This translates to something like: ""A city representative near the Anathura accident site said: """"Anyone who saw anything about the accident in the city or nearby, please come forward with information."""" They are all requesting information from anyone who saw the Anathura accident.""

This clearly indicates they are looking for *someone* who witnessed the accident, or *someone* who has information. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: owun dedenama miya giyaha** (They are there) - The passage doesn't confirm their *presence* just their request for information.
* **C: owun kaegasamin adamin sitiyaha** (They are worried about safety) - Safety isn't the focus of the quote.
* **D: dedenatama thuvala wiya** (There is a blockage there) - The passage doesn't mention any blockage.

mema vaedasatahanehi katayuthu karana widyaangayan balaporoththu wuye pahatha sandahan karunu walin kumana p‍rathiphalayak nisa aethi wana balapaem nireekshanaya kirimata da?,"The correct answer is **D: anduru padartha (inner matter/substance)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses heavily on ""anduru drawya"" (inner substance/matter) in relation to the Milky Way (Mandaakiniya) and Sagittarius (Dhanu Raashiya).**  It describes how these inner substances reflect light, are found in varying amounts, and are crucial to the observations being made.  The entire argument revolves around analyzing these ""anduru drawya.""
* **The question asks about what the observations relate to and what produces the reflected light.** The passage specifically states that the reflected light comes from the ""anduru drawya"" within the Milky Way.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: saaman‍ya padartha (common matter):** While ""anduru drawya"" *is* matter, the passage emphasizes its specific *inner* nature and its role in reflection, not just its general existence.
    * **B: udam balaya (heat/energy):**  Heat/energy is mentioned as *resulting* from the interactions, but it's not what the observations directly analyze or what's reflecting the light.
    * **C: kuda anshu (star drops/tears):** This refers to the visual appearance of the reflection, an *effect* of the ""anduru drawya"", not the substance itself.

**Therefore, the passage’s observations, as described in the text, are primarily about analyzing and understanding “anduru padartha” – the inner substances within the Milky Way.**



"
widyaangayan nireekshanaya karamin sitiye pahatha sandahan karunu walin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **D: dhanu mandakiniya saha k‍sheera pathaya**.

Here's why:

The passage repeatedly connects observations (kirimata) to the *Dhanu Mandakiniya* (Sagittarius constellation/Milky Way region) and the *Ksheera Pathaya* (Milky Way).  The passage describes how things reflected from these areas are observed and interpreted. The final sentence explicitly mentions *dhanu mandakiniyata balayak yoday* (strength of the Milky Way from Sagittarius) and *kshira pathaya* (Milky Way).  Therefore, the *vidyaangayan nireekshanaya* (observations of the wise) focus on these two celestial regions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: k‍sheera pathaya saha chandrayaa** - While the Milky Way is mentioned, the moon (chandrayaa) is not a significant focus of the passage.
*   **B: pruthiwiya saha dhanu mandakiniya** - The Earth (pruthiwiya) is mentioned in relation to reflections, but isn't the primary object of observation alongside the Dhanu Mandakiniya.
*   **C: pruthiwiya saha chandrayaa** - Neither the Earth nor the moon is central to the observations described.

"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, konsarwetiwwarun wisin wiwechanaya nokaranne kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: sahana wiyadam (सहන වියාදම - tolerant discussion)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P)** describes a situation after a disaster (likely Katrina) where there's disagreement and debate about rebuilding.  It emphasizes the need for a *liberal* and *thoughtful* approach to governance, focusing on *exercise of discernment* rather than strict contracts.  It suggests the discussion should be based on consideration rather than rigid adherence to rules.
* **The question (Q)** asks what the text *doesn't* encourage.
* **Option A (sahana wiyadam - tolerant discussion)** directly aligns with the call for a thoughtful, liberal, and discerning approach to the situation. The passage *does* encourage this.
* **Option B (naewatha goda naenvime prayathnaye aduwa - efforts to avoid future harm)** - While desirable, the passage doesn't specifically focus on *preventing* future harm, but rather on *how to deal with* the present situation.
* **Option C (yali indikirim konth‍raththu pirinaemenne kaatada - showing the contract is irrelevant)** - While the passage suggests moving *beyond* strict contractual adherence, it doesn't explicitly advocate *demonstrating* the contract’s irrelevance. It favors discernment *over* strict legalism.
* **Option D (naewatha goda naenvima sandaha wu wiyadam - discussion without considering future harm)** - This is the opposite of what the text encourages. The text implies careful consideration *is* needed, though not just through a legalistic lens.



Therefore, the text *does* encourage tolerant discussion, making **A** the answer to what the text doesn't discourage."
kaethrina suli kunatuwa ha sambandha sahana katayuthu sandaha wu yali indikirim konth‍raththuwa wiwechanaya karanne kawuda?,"The correct answer is **B: libaralwarun** (Liberals).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Yali idikireeme vyayama pilibanda libaralvaadi vivecanaya kendhragatha vuye..."" which translates to ""This discussion regarding the exercise/effort was centered around liberal consideration...""  This directly links the debate to liberals.
* **The question (Q) asks:**  Who carried out the contradictory analysis regarding the Katrina disaster?
* The passage sets up a disagreement (""mathabhedaya"") about the response to Katrina, and explicitly links this disagreement to a liberal viewpoint.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: podu depala sanrakshanaya (public asset protection):** While mentioned in the passage, it's not the *group* doing the analysis.
* **C: bush:** Bush is mentioned, but the passage doesn't state he was doing the contradictory analysis.
* **D: woshintan abhyanthara parshwayan (Washington insiders):**  This isn't explicitly mentioned as the source of the contradictory analysis.



Therefore, **libaralwarun** is the most accurate answer because the text directly connects the debate about the Katrina response to a liberal perspective."
"mema chedayata anuwa, stardast abhyawakaasha yaanaye widuli pahan palamuwa daekagatha haekke kothaeninda?","The correct answer is **D: madhyama origan**.

This translates to: ""...it will travel from north California towards the east, and will be visible in the sky over **central Oregon**, Nevada and Idaho.""

Therefore, Stardust's re-entry was visible over central Oregon, among other places.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, abhyawakaasha yaanaya pahatha sandahan kumana karuna sambandhawa vaarthawak thabanu aethi da?","The correct answer is **C: wegawathma pruthiwiyata aapasu yaame gamana** (travel between Earth and space).

Here's why:

* **The passage heavily focuses on space travel.** It discusses the Stardust mission, a module landing on the moon (1969), and the projected path of an object across California, Oregon, Nevada, and Utah.  All of this directly relates to journeys *to and from* Earth and space.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ahase wada pululma parasaya aalokamath kirima** (seeing bright lights in the sky) - While the passage *mentions* seeing a bright light, this is a *result* of the space travel, not the core concept being discussed.
* **B: boho nagarawala daekiya haeki vima** (visions seen by many people) - The passage mentions people *observing* the object, but doesn't focus on the visions themselves.
* **D: saen fraensiskoo sita los aenjalees dakva wegawathma gaman kirima** (travel from San Francisco to Los Angeles) - This is a specific part of the object's path, but not the broader theme of space travel.



"
aachaarya malar balasub‍ramaniyan ge saroja balasub‍ramaniyan hata wu ngaathi sambandhaya kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: sahodriya (sister)**.

Here's why:

The text states ""53 haeviridi sarojaa baalasubramaniyamge dehaya soyagatha"" and earlier mentions ""29 haeviridi vaidya malar subramaaniyam"".  The phrasing implies they are related, and the context of a tragic event strongly suggests a family connection.  The most logical relationship between two women with the same surname, especially in this context, is sisterhood.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: diyaniya (daughter):** The ages (29 and 53) make a mother-daughter relationship less likely.
*   **C: mawa (mother):**  Again, the ages don't fit a mother-son dynamic.
*   **D: naenda (friend):** While possible, the gravity of the situation and familial surnames point to a closer relation.



"
sara balasub‍ramaniyange mala sirura soyaagaththe kohenda?,"The correct answer is **C: motar rathaya thula** (in a motor vehicle).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...le waekunu blankettuvakin aawaranaya kara thibu 53 haeviridi sarojaa baalasubramaniyamge dehaya soyagatha. Mala sirura dinak pamana ehi thibi aethi bhava polisiya pawasai.""  This translates to ""...covered in a blanket, the body of 53-year-old Sarojaa Balasubramaniyam was found. Police said the body was found on a day of accidents with a motor vehicle.""

Therefore, Sarojaa Balasubramaniyam's body was found related to a motor vehicle accident.



"
eebe wisin athpathkara gaththe kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: skayip**.

Here's why:

* **P's text is about Skype.** It mentions Skype's power, popularity in various regions (Europe, Brazil), and its use for communication.  The entire passage revolves around describing Skype.
* **Q asks what is being discussed.** The passage directly discusses Skype.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Microsoft:** While Microsoft *owns* Skype, the passage focuses on Skype itself, not Microsoft as a company.
* **B: Apple Company:** Apple isn't mentioned at all in the passage.
* **D: Zoom:** Zoom is a competitor to Skype, but it's not the subject of the text.



"
ebandu de athpathkara gaeneema haraha eebe balaporoththu wanne kumakda?,"The question asks what the powerful places mentioned in the passage are used for. Let's break down the passage (P) to find the answer.

The passage talks about expanding profits through diversification, and mentions strong places in Europe, Brazil, and sky-high locations being popular *for attracting gatherings/events* (""samagama balaaporottu wei"").

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: ehi aadayama shakthimath kirima** (using these powerful places).  This aligns with the idea of attracting gatherings *to* those locations.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: nawa p‍radesha walata pulul kirima** (expanding to new regions) - While the passage mentions regions, it doesn’t say these places are for expansion *itself*.
* **C: ehi paethikada ihala naenvima** (increasing faith/beliefs) - The passage doesn't mention anything about faith.
* **D: ehi kotas himiyan thrupthimath kirima** (satisfying company desires) - The passage focuses on attracting events/gatherings, not specifically company desires.

"mema chedayata anuwa, satanin pasu midule raendee siti raendawiyan samaga an‍yon‍ya lesa katayuthu nokale kawuda?","The correct answer is **A: maedihathkaruwan (firefighters)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a fire in the middle of the city, caused by someone (potentially related to ""Satan"" in the opening phrase, but focusing on the event itself). It mentions people preparing for chaos, and then states that firefighters (""maedihathkaruwan"") were enthusiastic to get to work and extinguish the fire. The other options don't fit the context:

*   **B: gini nivime kandayama (fire extinguishing location)** - This is *where* they fight the fire, not *who* is fighting it.
*   **C: niladhaareen (blue wearers/people in blue)** - Refers to people preparing for chaos, not the responders.
*   **D: rohal kaarya mandalaya (traffic department)** - Not directly involved in extinguishing the fire.

Therefore, the passage identifies the firefighters as the group interacting with the fire and the situation.



"

The text states: ""...kolaahala avasthaavalata sarilana lesa sannaddhawa paemini niladhaarin midulata aetulu wee **kandulu vaayuva muktha karamin** raendaviyan konakata gonu kalo ya.""  This translates to ""...the approaching two hundred, releasing **bitter winds** onto the pale blue faces prepared to enter the chaotic state.""

This directly links the chaotic state (kolaahala avasthaavalata) to the bitter wind.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: saarthaka sakachcha** (meaningful sacrifice) - While sacrifice might be part of the overall context, it's not *causing* the chaos.
*   **C: thuvala laebu sesu raendawiyan** (two hundred sesame-seed laborers) - These are actors *in* the event, not the *cause* of the chaos.
*   **D: ginnak** (fire) - Fire is present, but the text describes the wind *preceding* and contributing to the chaos. The fire is a result of the chaos, not its initial cause.



"
"aayathulla ali kamenige mathaya anuwa, iranaya ratak lesa nidhas wiya yuththe kumak wethin da?","The correct answer is **B: islameeya wiplawaya** (Islamic Revolution).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Rate uththarithara naayaka ayatulla ali kameni 1979 dee iraanaye islaameeya viplavayata pere sitama tell matha yaepima """"ugulak"""" lesath, ein rata nidahas viya yuthu bawath visthara karana ladhi.""

This translates to: ""The country's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, with the foundation he laid during the 1979 Islamic Revolution of Iran, helped expand the country's independence and strength.""

Therefore, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's foundation is linked to the Islamic Revolution, which facilitated Iran's independence.

This translates to: ""However, the main factor affecting the Iranian economy is the income from oil exports, which accounts for 80% of Iran's foreign exchange earnings, especially due to the sanctions imposed by the European Union and **OPEC**...""

Therefore, OPEC is directly identified as a significant factor influencing the Iranian economy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: j‍yeshta mulasra (senior source)** - This is a vague term used in the beginning, but doesn't represent a specific economic factor.
*   **C: aayathulla ali kameni (Ayatollah Ali Khamenei)** - While a political leader, he's mentioned in relation to the revolution, not as a direct economic influence.
*   **D: yuropa sangamaya (European Union)** - The EU's sanctions are *affected by* OPEC's actions, but the EU itself isn't the *primary* economic factor mentioned in the passage.

The question asks what action was taken regarding the process of requesting a ballot box. The passage directly states a request for a ballot box was made and approved.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: apek‍shakayin wisin ewana lada niyojithayin** (appointed by those expecting/requesting) - The passage mentions appointment of people, but not *because* of the ballot box request.
*   **C: chanda p‍rakaasha kirime rola hi athsan thaebeema** (a role to reveal the ballot) - While revealing the ballot box is mentioned, this isn't the initial action.
*   **D: apek‍shakayaage niyojithayin wisin ganankarana lada chanda** (counting votes by appointed representatives) - This refers to *after* the ballot box is available, not the initial step.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...lipi kavarayak thula thama kaemati apekshakayaa dakwamin pere-mudritha kolayak thabaannoya.""  This translates to ""...the expected information from the script is published in printed media.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: chanda p‍rakaasha kirime rolak matha** (the role of publishing the vote) - This refers to *how* votes are published, not *where* the information is found.
* **C: lipi kawarayak matha** (the script itself) - The script is the *source* of information, not where it's published.
* **D: kutiyak thula yanth‍rayak matha** (the voting machine) - The passage doesn’t mention information being sourced from the voting machine.



Therefore, the passage explicitly states that the expected information is published in **printed media**."
aelanta musashi sandaha wasara ataka sevimak aarambha kirimata hethu wuye kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: samudra gaweshanaya sandaha ohuge aayojanaya**.

The passage states: ""...siya dhanayen waedi pramaanayak samudra gavesanaya sandaha aayojanaya kara aetaeyi kiya visvaasa karana athara..."" This translates to ""...he believed in funding an expedition for ocean exploration with the wealth he possessed...""

Therefore, Musashi began his adventure due to the planning and funding of the ocean exploration. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ohuge dhanaya (his wealth):** While his wealth *enabled* the exploration, it wasn't the direct *reason* he started the adventure.
* **B: muhudu pathula sithiyam gatha kirima kerehi ohuge unanduwa (his interest in the shipwreck):** The shipwreck is mentioned, but not as the primary motivation.
* **D: ohuge yuddhaya kerehi unanduwa (his interest in war):** The passage mentions war in passing but doesn't connect it to the start of Musashi's exploration.

"mema chedayata anuwa, aelan thama mudalin saelakiya yuthu p‍ramanayak wiyadam kale kumak sandahada?","The correct answer is **B: samudra gaweshanaya** (ocean exploration).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""...siya dhanayen waedi pramaanayak samudra gavesanaya sandaha aayojanaya kara aetaeyi kiya visvaasa karana athara...""  This translates to ""...he trusted in planning and organizing an ocean exploration with the money he had...""
* **The question (Q) asks:** ""...what did he plan and organize with the money he had as his capital?""

Therefore, the passage directly answers the question with ""ocean exploration"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: musashi naewatha pihituvima** - This doesn't relate to how he spent his money.
* **C: diya yata durastha palana yaath‍rawak godanaegeema** -  This refers to distant journeys across rivers, not the main focus of the text.
* **D: muhudu pathula sithiyamkaranaya gaena igena gaeneema** -  This describes a feeling about the ocean, not a planned activity.

This translates to ""Officials estimate that this area might have a uranium fuel storage facility, and whether this is true or not is uncertain.""
* **The question (Q) asks:** What is the reason for the disturbance and anxiety surrounding this place?
* **Uranium fuel** being potentially stored there is the direct cause of the disturbance and the official's statements, as it raises concerns about potential hazards.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: wikiranasheelee seesiyam (radiation-emitting substance):** While related to uranium, it's a *result* of uranium potentially being there, not the *cause* of the disturbance.
* **C: sudu dumaraya (white smoke):** The smoke is a symptom, not the root cause.
* **D: ayadin (iodine):**  Iodine is mentioned as something that *came* with the substance, but doesn't explain the initial concern.

Here's why:

* **P's text describes a scenario where officials are complaining about the excessive use of air conditioning (vaayu samikarana akriya kirimatat) leading to a shortage of water (nala jalaya nobiimatat).**  The text explicitly links the air conditioning to the problem.
* **Q's question asks about a protective instruction (aarakshaka upades) related to a specific area.**  Given the context of P, the most logical area being discussed is the one directly affected by the air conditioning – the cooled area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: aethulatha raendee siteema** (the area where it rained) - Rain isn't mentioned as a problem or focal point in the text.
* **C: sudu dumaraya aashvasa kirimen vaelakee siteema** (the area where the white mist is assured) - While ""sudu dumaraya"" (white mist) is mentioned, it's a consequence of the issue, not the area the instruction would be about.
* **D: nala jalaya panaya kirimen vaelakee siteema** (the area where water is being paid for) - Water scarcity is the *result* of the air conditioning use, not the area the instruction is protecting.



Therefore, option A is the only one directly and logically connected to the information provided in the initial text."

The passage explicitly states that Vaidya Tony Mol is working on XDR-TB, which is a form of tuberculosis that has developed **resistance to drugs** (""vaidya tony mol kvasulu nataal nam dakunu aprikaanu kalapayen daedi lesa ausadhavalata prathirodhaya dakwana kshaya rogaya (xdr-tb) soyaagatteya"").  The question asks what Vaidya Mol is trying to address, and drug resistance is the core problem with XDR-TB.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: mema p‍rabhedya rohalen paethireema** (the prevalence of this type) - While the passage discusses the prevalence, it doesn't state that's what Vaidya Mol is *addressing*.
*   **C: aasaditha pudgalayeku wisin aasadnaya kala haeki pudgalayinge p‍ramanaya** (the amount of time a person is exposed to an infected person) - This refers to how the disease spreads, but isn't the *problem* Vaidya Mol is tackling.
*   **D: ehi ihala marana anupathaya** (high mortality rate) -  The high mortality rate is a *result* of the problem (drug resistance), not the problem itself that Vaidya Mol is working to solve.

The text states: ""...sameepa sambandhatha pawathwana aya **10 sita 15 dakva** pramanayakata meya bo kirimata ida aetha.""  This translates to ""...this must be done in a dosage of **10 to 15 drops** for those in close contact.""

The question asks how many drops a healthy worker (soukya sevakayin) should take. While the range is 10-15, the question likely wants the lower bound as a starting point or typical amount. Therefore, 10 is the most reasonable answer from the choices provided.

NextGen paddhathiya bhawitha karanne kumana aakaaraye thaakshanayak da?,"The correct answer is **A: chandrikaa matha padanam wu thaakshanaya**.

Therefore, the NextGen method involves calculating **lunar landing positions** (chandrikaa matha padanam).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: nirawadya thaakshanaya (flawless calculation):** While the passage mentions striving for accuracy, it doesn't state that *flawless calculation* is the core development of NextGen.
* **C: bhoomigatha redar padanam karagath thaakshanaya (terrestrial radar landing position calculation):**  The passage specifically says NextGen *replaces* this method, not that it's based on it.
* **D: kaaban wimochana thaakshanaya (carbon emission calculation):** This is mentioned in the passage as something being *reduced* through the method, not what the method *is*.

NextGen guwan gaman palakawarunta rijuwama p‍rathilabha labaa denne keseda?,"The correct answer is **B: wadath niwaeredi guwan yaana pihiteema** (reducing fuel consumption in vehicles).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) focuses on:** methods to reduce carbon emissions from transportation, specifically by improving fuel efficiency in next-generation vehicles. It talks about things like alternative fuels, lighter materials, and improved aerodynamic designs to achieve this.  It also mentions regulations to *reduce* fuel usage.
* **The question (Q) asks:** How can NextGen vehicle transportation be most beneficial?
* **Option B directly addresses the core issue:** Reducing fuel consumption (wadath niwaeredi guwan yaana pihiteema) is *the* way NextGen vehicles will be beneficial – by lessening environmental impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: keti guwan gaman marga (shorter travel routes):** While shorter routes *can* help, the passage primarily emphasizes fuel efficiency *within* the travel itself.
* **C: adu kaaban wimochanaya (carbon emissions):** This is *the problem* being addressed, not the benefit of NextGen vehicles.
* **D: adu indhana (fuel):**  Simply mentioning fuel isn't the benefit – it's *reducing* fuel use that matters.

The core issue is *why* these investigations are no longer seen as valuable.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pahasuwen wisandiya haeki aparadha sandaha sampath wen kirima** (collecting wealth through fraudulent investigations) - The passage mentions 'pahasu' (investigations) but not fraud or illegal wealth gathering. It's about diminishing *value* not illicit gain.
* **C: kaamuka darshana siddheen kerehi daedi awadhaanayak yomu kirima** (paying attention to achieving a sensual vision) - This is completely unrelated to the content of the passage.
* **D: motar ratha sorakam siddheen** (achieving motor vehicle theft) - This is also completely unrelated to the passage's topic of historical investigations and organizational effectiveness.

**Therefore, option A best reflects the central issue presented in the passage: the investigations are losing their justification and therefore their worth.**

mema asabhyatha vaedasatahana FBI hata kirimata bala karanne kumakda?,"The question asks what the FBI investigated regarding the indecency. Let's break down the original text (P) to understand:

* **""Ithihaasagnayo, ef bee ai pratipattin vivechanaya karanne niyojitaayatanaye saarthakatvaya waedi kara penvime adahasin visandimata pahasu, motor rathha sorakam wani pahasu vimarsanayanta ovunge sampath yodavanneya yanna ismathu karamini.""** - This talks about an investigation into the effectiveness of a planned operation involving indecent images, motor vehicle theft, and potential asset forfeiture.
* **""Congrasaya 2005 moolya varshaye dee asabhya de sambandhayen wana mulaarambhayata aramudal saepayima aarambha kala athara ef.bee.ayi visin vaedihiti kamuka darshana sandaha niyojitayin 10 deneku ven kala yuthu bavata niyama kale ya.""** -  This details that Congress initiated an investigation in 2005 relating to indecency, specifically looking at a planned operation involving indecent images (kamuka darshana) that spanned 10 days.

Based on this, the FBI's investigation focused on the **indecent images** aspect of the operation.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: kaamuka darshana siddheen sandaha niyojithayan wen kirima** (Investigating the planned operation related to indecent images).



"
JAS 39C Gripen yaanaya anathurata p‍rathichaara daek wu gini niwana vahanayata sidu wuye kumakda? ,"The correct answer is **B: eya perali giyeya** (it was tested).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Desiya maadhya vaarthaa kale e sambandhava katayutu karat dee athara guvan totupola gini nivana waahanaya perali giya bavayi."" This translates to: ""Following the media reports, the Swedish air force tested the fire suppression system of the Gripen aircraft.""  ""Perali giya"" means ""was tested.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eya winasha wiya** (it was destroyed) - The text doesn't mention the plane being destroyed, only a test of the fire suppression system.
* **C: eya pupura giyeya** (it was filled) - This makes no sense in the context of the text.
* **D: ehi indhana iwara wiya** (it ran out of fuel) - The text doesn't mention fuel.



"
JAS 39C Gripen yaanaya anathurata lakvimen pasuwa guwan thotupala wasa daemuwe kumak sandahada?,"The correct answer is **B: gini niwana ratha** (fire extinguishing vehicle).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...guvan totupola vaanija guvan yaana sandaha wasaa damana ladi... guvan totupola gini nivana waahanaya perali giya bavayi.""  This translates to ""...commercial flight was delayed... a fire extinguishing vehicle was sent to the runway.""

Therefore, the text indicates a fire extinguishing vehicle was sent due to the Gripen aircraft's situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: vanija guwan gaman** (commercial flight) - The text says the commercial flight was *delayed*, not what caused the delay.
* **C: desheeya maadhya** (national media) - The text mentions national media *reporting* on the situation, but it wasn't sent to the runway.
* **D: balaghana nayakayin** (air force commander) -  The commander issued instructions, but wasn't physically sent.



"
irana wiplawaya atharathura b‍rasesinski maga penvima labaa dunne kaatada?,"The correct answer is **A: kisingar**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""1979 iraana viplavaya saha ehi vipaakayak woo 1979 iraana praana aepakaru arbudhaya; saha 1979 dee soviyat deshaya visin aefganisthaanaya aakramanaya kireema e athara wei.""  It *also* states earlier that Henry Kissinger ""labā dun athara"" (received advice from) regarding foreign policy related to Iran. Therefore, Kissinger is the one connected to the Iranian revolution in the provided text.



"
1977 dakva jaathika aarakshaka upadeshakayeku lesa sewaya kale kawuda?,"The correct answer is **B: kisingar**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""1976 maetivaranayedi ohu kaatarta videsha pratipattiya sambandhava upades labaa dun athara henri kisingerta pasuwa 1977 sita 1981 dakva jaathika aarakshaka upadeshaka (nsa) lesa sevaya kaleya."" 

This translates to: ""After the 1976 election, he received advice on foreign policy regarding Qatar, and then Henry Kissinger served as National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981.""

Therefore, Kissinger was the National Security Advisor from 1977 onwards.



"
partisan belgred samaga wu bobekge kreeda wurthiya niwaerediwa pilibimbu nokaranne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: ohu kandayama wenuwen kreeda karamin gola 468 kata vaedi p‍ramanayak vaartha kaleya** (He scored 468 goals while playing for Red Star Belgrade, a verifiable fact).

Here's why:

* **The question asks about verifiable achievements related to Bobek's career with Partizan Belgrade.** The passage specifically states he scored 468 goals in 403 matches for them.  This is a concrete, factual accomplishment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ohu wenath kreedakayanta wada vaedi gola p‍ramanayak labaa gena aetha** (He didn't score more goals than any other player - we don't have evidence for that) - The text doesn't compare his goal count to others.
* **C: ohu warak kandayam ithihasaye hondama kreedakayaa lesa theree path wiya** (He was recognized as one of the best players in Red Star's history) - This is true (mentioned in the last sentence), but the question asks about *achievements*, not recognition.
* **D: ohu wenath onaema kreedakayekuta wada vaedi tharaga wala penee sitiyeya** (He didn't play with any other players who scored more than him) -  The passage doesn't discuss other players' scores.



"
partisan belgred samaga wu bobekge ithihasaya pilibanda sath‍ya p‍rakaashaya wanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: ohu 1945 dee partisan wenuwen kreeda kirimata patan gaththeya** (He started playing for Partizan in 1945).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kro-eshiyanu aganuvara wana, saegreb hi upatha lada bobek partizan belgrade venuven kreeda karana samaye janapriyatvayata patviya. Ohu 1945 dee ovun wetha sambandha wee 1958 dakva raendi sitiye ya.""  This directly translates to ""Bobek gained popularity while playing for Partizan Belgrade, and was associated with them from 1945 to 1958.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ohu partisan belgredata pera sagreb wenuwen kreeda kaleya** (He played for Zagreb after Partizan Belgrade) - The passage doesn't mention him playing for Zagreb.
* **C: ohu 1995 dakva partisan wenuwen kreeda kaleya** (He played for Partizan until 1995) - The passage explicitly states he played *until* 1958.
* **D: partisan hi hondama kreedakayaa lesa theree pathvimen pasuwa ohu keerthiyak labaa gaththeya** (He gained fame after being recognized as Partizan's best player) - While he *was* recognized as their best player in 1995, the passage doesn't state that this is *how* he gained fame, only that he was recognized as such *in* 1995.  The initial reason for his fame was playing *for* Partizan.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, hesperonichas wa welosiraeptar wethin wenaskara dakwanne kumana lakshanaya da?","The correct answer is **C: eyata sampurnayenma pihatu sahitha shareerayak aetha** (It has a complete body with feathers).

Here's why:

* **P's description** heavily focuses on a creature (""velosiraeptar"") that is a flesh-eating bird *with feathers* (""pihatuvalin vaesunu""). It's described as having a full body.
* **Option C** directly reflects this key detail – the creature has a complete body *with* feathers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eyata kakul dekak thibe** (It has a beak) - While likely true, the passage doesn't *emphasize* a beak.
* **B: eyata wishala dewani niyapothu aetha** (It is associated with a large deity) - The passage mentions a deity, but the connection isn't about the creature being *associated* with it. It's about a command *from* the deity.
* **D: eyata unusum rudhirayak aetha** (It has warm blood) -  This is a characteristic of birds, but not the primary defining feature highlighted in the passage.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
“hesperonichas” yannehi arthaya labaa gena aeththe kumana jivi wisheshaye bhawthika lakshanayen da?,"The correct answer is **B: pihatu sahitha shareeraya (body with feathers)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes ""hesdparonishas"" as a ""rudhira maansa bhaksaka paksiyaa"" (flesh-eating bird).** This immediately points to a creature with a body.
* **The phrase ""pihaatuvalin vaesunu"" (covered in feathers)** directly links feathers to ""hesdparonishas"".
* The passage focuses on the physical characteristics of this creature – its flesh-eating nature, its feathers, its feet (""paada"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: niyapoththa(thu) (nail/claw):** While the creature likely *has* claws, the passage doesn't define ""hesdparonishas"" *as* a claw. It's a part of the creature, not the creature itself.
* **C: paada (feet):** Again, feet are a *part* of the creature, not what defines it.
* **D: hota (horn):** There is no mention of horns in the passage.



Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the text is a body covered in feathers - **pihatu sahitha shareeraya**."
wedi thaebeeme siddhiya pilibanda pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashawalin niwaeredi wanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: wedi thaebeeme siddhiya bafalo hi siduwiya** (The wedding took place in Buffalo due to the bride's insistence).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bafalohi upatha labu 30 viyaeti saemiya, vedi thaebimen marumuvata path woo siv denaagen keneku woo namuth, ohuge biriyata haaniyak sidu novini.""  This translates to: ""The bride insisted on Buffalo, and no one opposed it, even though it would harm her family's finances."" This directly indicates the wedding was held in Buffalo *because* of the bride's insistence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: saemiyaa saha birinda dedenama teksas walin wethi** (The groom and bride both wanted to go from Texas) - The passage mentions Texas as where they *met*, not where they wanted the wedding.
* **B: windithayin ganana pas deneku we** (It was after considering the expenses) - While finances are mentioned, the passage clearly states the bride's insistence was the deciding factor, not a cost calculation.
* **C: mema yuwala meeta wasarakata pera baflao hi wivaha wuha** (This young couple had a wedding in Buffalo after meeting) - This is a general statement and doesn't explain *why* Buffalo was chosen.



"
wedi thaebeema sidu wu sthaanaya sambandhayen kumana p‍rakaashaya niwaeredi da?,"The correct answer is **A: eya bafalo hi wivaha sanwathsara saadayaka dee siduwiya** (It happened during the wedding anniversary in Buffalo).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...mituran ha naedaeyan samaga saemarima sandaha baffalo wetha paeminiyaha. Bafalohi upatha labu 30 viyaeti saemiya..."" (They celebrated their anniversary with friends and relatives in Buffalo. The celebration was 30 years after the wedding).  The question asks about the location related to the event where the ""wedi thaebeema"" (incident/situation) occurred. The passage clearly links the event to the 30th wedding anniversary celebration *in Buffalo*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: eya sidu wuye nila sanwathsara uthsawayakadee ya** (Did it happen during the blue anniversary celebration?) - The passage mentions a wedding anniversary (30 years) not a ""blue anniversary.""
*   **C: meya sidu wuye teksas hi paewathi sadayakadee ya** (Did it happen during the visit to Texas?) - Texas is mentioned as where the couple met, not where the event took place.
*   **D: meya sidu wuye yawalage wivaha mangal‍yayedee ya** (Did it happen during the couple’s wedding?) - The event happened 30 years *after* the wedding, during an anniversary.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, luno sambandhayen niladhaareenge mulika awadhaanaya yomu wuye kumak wethada?","The correct answer is **B: rala saha adhika sulan**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""rala saha adhika sulang saha rala hetuven diyakadanaya wetha thallu wee yana vita"" (due to rails and high slopes, the difficulty of landing). The question asks about the primary concern regarding the Luna (moon) landing. The difficulties presented by the terrain (rails and slopes) are the most prominent concern highlighted in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: pohora thogaye aduwak** (exhaust of the thrusters) - While mentioned, it's a consequence *of* the landing, not the primary concern about the landing *itself*.
*   **C: indhana kaandu vima** (fuel capacity) - Fuel capacity is mentioned as a range (120-160 cubic meters) but not as a primary problem.
*   **D: kaarya mandala samajikayanta siduwiya haeki thuvala** (difficulties for the operational team) -  This is a very general statement and doesn't relate to the specific challenges described in the passage.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, luno aapadawata lakvima pilibanda pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashayangen sath‍ya p‍rakaashaya wanne kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: bhaanda thogaya patava gaeneemata pera aapadawata lak wiya** (The disaster occurred after the cargo ship capsized).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Meetara 100k diga naukaava ehi supurudu pohora togaya patavaa gaeneema sandaha yamin sity athara  yaatraven togayak ihiriya haeki yaeyi niladhaarin mulin biya viya."" (A 100km long ship capsized, causing the disaster.)  This directly links the disaster to the capsizing of the ship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: naewa aapadawata lakwana awasthaawe indhana meetar 100k naewehi thibee aetha** (The disaster did not happen due to the fuel being 100k meters away) - The passage mentions fuel volume (120-160 cubic meters) but doesn't say the disaster was *caused* by its location.
* **C: kaarya mandalaye samajikayan dolos denagen ek ayek thuvala laebeeya** (One person from the social team of the operation center escaped) - This is a detail about a rescue effort, not the *cause* of the disaster.
* **D: naewa diyakadanayata thallu wiya** (There was no damage to the delivery) - The passage implies significant damage and a disaster occurred, so this is false.



Therefore, the passage clearly identifies the capsizing of the cargo ship as the event *leading to* the disaster."
aeljiriyaawa nidhasa laebuwe kumana dashakaya thulada?,"The correct answer is **C: 1960 dashakaye**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""1960 dee ohu chitrapata adyakshanaya igaenvimata aluthin nidahasa labaa gath aelgeriyava wetha naewatha giyeya.""  This translates to ""In 1960, he received a new appointment as a film director in Algeria.""  Therefore, Algeria gave him the appointment in the **1960s**."
awamangal‍ya uthsawaya sandaha rupavahinee thira pihituva nothibune koheda?,"The correct answer is **A: romaya purawatama** (Rome city).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Janataavata uthsavaya naerabimata ida deemata romaye vividha sthaanavala vishaala rupavaahini thira raesak sthaapanaya karana ladi.""  This translates to ""To show the festival to the public, large television screens were set up in various places in Rome.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ithaliye wiwidha nagarawala** (various cities in Italy): While the text mentions Italy and Poland, it specifically says the screens were set up in *Rome*.
*   **C: polanthaye samahara sthaanawala** (various places in Poland): The text mentions Poland, but doesn't state screens were set up there.
*   **D: shantha peethara chathurashraye** (St. Peter's Square): The text mentions St. Peter's Square as a place where the celebration was visible, but the *screens* were not specifically located there.



"
awamangal‍ya uthsawaya pawathwanu laebuwe koheda?,"The correct answer is **A: romaya pura wiwidha sthaanawala** (various places in Rome).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Janataavata uthsavaya naerabimata ida deemata romaye vividha sthaanavala vishaala rupavaahini thira raesak sthaapanaya karana ladi.""  This translates to ""To enable the public to participate in the festival, large television screens were set up in various places in Rome.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: polanthaye (Poland):** The passage mentions Poland as a place where the festival is *seen* due to broadcasts, not where it *happens*.
* **C: shantha peethara chathurashraye (St. Peter's Square):** The passage says the Pope *addressed* the audience from St. Peter's Square, but doesn't say the festival was *held* there.
* **D: palamuwa romaye, pasuwa thawath ithali nagarayaka (first in Rome, then in other Italian cities):** The passage doesn't suggest the festival moved to other Italian cities. It focuses on broadcasts to a wider audience, including Poland.



"
pipireemen pasuwa barapathala thuvala sandaha p‍rathikaara laebuwe kawuda?,"The correct answer is **A: awama washayen pas deneku**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...kampana roga laksana sambandhayen pipirima avasthave adaala sthaanaye sity pudgalayan pas denekutavat pratikaara karana ladi.""  This translates to ""...individuals are advised to take precautions due to the preliminary stage of symptoms related to dengue fever.""

Therefore, the precautions are being given *to* individuals (awama washayen pas deneku).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: kisiweku naetha (no one)** - The text explicitly states precautions *are* being given.
*   **C: gaes samagame niladhaariyek (the mosquito breeding ground holders)** - While controlling mosquito breeding grounds is important, the text focuses on *individual* precautions.
*   **D: asalvaesiyek (the sick person)** -  The text speaks of preventing the spread and protecting people *before* they become seriously ill, not just treating the sick.



"
gaes kaanduwak gaena vaartha kale kawuda?,"The correct answer is **A: godanaegille asalvaesiyek**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""**Asalvaesiyeku gaes kaanduvak gaena daenum deemen pasuwa**"" which translates to ""Someone reported seeing the animal (gaes) to the village headman."" 

Therefore, the person who saw the animal and reported it is the village headman (godanaegille asalvaesiyek).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: baddha nivasaye nivaesiyek:**  The passage talks about people *in* the quarantined area, but doesn't say the reporter is *from* there.
* **C: gaes samagame niladhaariyek:** This refers to someone monitoring the animal's movements, not the reporter.
* **D: godanaegille kalamanakaru:** This translates to ""village headman's clerk"" - the passage states the headman *received* the report, not a clerk.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, p‍raharayen kopamana pirisak miya giyeda?","The question asks how many people were involved in the events described in the passage. Let's break down the passage to identify the individuals mentioned:

* **25 viyaeti:** 25 people initially involved.
* **21 viyaeti:** 21 people were subsequently injured. (This doesn't necessarily mean *new* people, some of the initial 25 could be among these injured.)
* **Edgaar vegvilage:** Edgar Vegvilage - 1 person
* **Krestopher snayidarta:** Christopher Snayidart - 1 person
* **Pasvaeni pudhgalayage hisata ilakka karana vita yukage gini aviya waerede giya athara:** (This describes a fire involving someone's past, but implies only one person was directly involved in that incident).
* **Snayidarta akhanda wedanawak:** Again referring to Snayidart.

Therefore, we have: 25 (initial) + Edgar + Christopher + 1 (fire victim).  However, the 21 injured *could* be among the initial 25.  To be conservative and assume they are distinct, we'd have 25 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 29.  But the question doesn't seem to be looking for a precise count including overlapping people. It is asking for how many people are *named* in connection to the actions described.

Considering that, the key individuals mentioned are Edgar, Christopher, and the person involved in the fire, plus the initial groups of 25 and 21.  However, the question seems to be focused on the *actors* or *perpetrators* of actions. Edgar and Christopher are specifically mentioned as doing things (Vegvilage bahu saha hakka thuwala woo athara and Snayidart doing a reconstruction). The fire victim isn't performing an action.

Given the options, the most reasonable answer is **2**, representing Edgar and Christopher who are actively described as doing things.

Therefore, the answer is **B: 2**.



"
p‍raharaya atharathura yam awasthaawaka wedi thaebeemata asamath wu aayudhaya kaageda?,"The correct answer is **C: shnayidar**.

Here's why:

The text describes Snayidar undergoing extensive and painful reconstruction after a significant injury. It mentions a ""akhanda wedanawak"" (continuous pain), being blinded in one eye, and a titanium reconstruction of his face.  The question asks what weapon caused the damage leading to this state.  The text heavily implies Snayidar was injured, and the details point to a severe attack, making ""Snayidar"" the most logical answer as the *result* of the weapon's use.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kadabaek:**  Kadabaek is described as *using* a weapon (or methods) to interrogate, not being harmed by one.
* **B: ookaa:** Okaa isn’t mentioned in the text at all.
* **D: aelden:** Aeldan is a location, not a weapon or perpetrator of harm.



"
olimpik vaedasatahanen iwath kirimata thora ganna ladde pahatha sandahan kreedawangen kawareda?,"The correct answer is **D: karate**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Skosh, karaate saha roller kreeda, beysbol saha mrudu pandu lesama olympik vaedasatahanata aetulat weemata uthsaha daru athara 2005 olympik ulale chanda vimasimakadi ema uthsahaya vyartha kara daemini."" This translates to: ""Skosh, karate and roller sports, baseball and softball were eager to enter the Olympic Games, but that enthusiasm was wasted after the 2005 Olympic deadline.""

This clearly indicates karate was among the sports hoping to be included in the Olympics but didn't make it.  The question asks which sport *tried* to get into the Olympics, and karate is the only option listed that the passage specifically mentions attempting to do so.



"
jaath‍yanthara olimpik kamituwa kreeda ulelata aethulath kirimata chandyen thora gaththe pahatha sandahan kreeda walin kumana kreedawada?,"The correct answer is **C: ragbi sangamaya (rugby union)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ragby, visesayenma ragby yunion, saha golf salaka baleemata idiripath kala thavat kreeda pahak abhibava olympik sandaha sahabhagi weemata thoraganna ladi.""  This translates to: ""rugby, especially rugby union, and golf were strong contenders to become olympic sports, but they were unable to get olympic participation for a long time.""

The question asks which sport *finally* got the green light from the International Olympic Committee. The passage clearly identifies rugby union as a sport that overcame obstacles to be included.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: rolark reeda (roller sports)** - Mentioned as wanting to be included, but not stated as having been approved.
*   **B: besbol (baseball)** - Similar to roller sports, just a desire to be included.
*   **D: mrudu pandu (softball)** - Also like the others, an attempt that didn't succeed at the time of the passage.



"
aathar ginas mulinma shantha jems geyt skaagaraya baddata gaththe awurudu keeyak sandaha da?,"The question asks for the year mentioned regarding the arrival of ""Aathar Gines"" at ""Shantha James Get Skaagaraya Baddata"".

Looking at the text (P), the first line states: ""1759 saeptaembar 24 venida, ather gines ayarlanthaye doublinhi santa james get iskagaraya..."".  This clearly indicates the year is **1759**.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 1759**.



"
saema wasarakama ginas dolar biliyana keeyak pamana gena enne da?,"The correct answer is **D: 10**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Vasara 250 kata pasu gines saema wasarakama euro biliyana 10 (ae.doo. biliyana 14.7) ka adayamak sahitha goleeya vyaparayak bavata vardhanaya viya.""  This translates to: ""With the addition of a trade fair to expand the weekly income of 10 euros (approximately 14.7 dollars) per 250 items sold.""

The question asks how many *dollars* are earned weekly.  The text explicitly states ""ae.doo. biliyana 14.7"" which is approximately 14.7 dollars. However, the core value mentioned alongside the weekly income is **10** euros, which is then *related* to 14.7 dollars. The question is about the number of *euros* earned weekly, which is **10**.

Therefore, the answer is **D: 10**."
yuropa sangamaye ratawal keeyaka H5N1 wairasaya handunagena thibe da?,"The passage states: ""Oustriyavata, germaniyata, sloveniyavata, balgeriyavata, greesiyata saha italiyata pasuwa mema vairasayen pidavata path yuropa sangamaye satvaeni rata pranshaya we.""  This translates to: ""Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece and Italy are among the seven European Union countries affected by this virus.""

Therefore, the answer is **A: pahaka** (seven).  ""Pahaka"" means seven in Sinhalese.



"
H5N1 wairasaye nawathama rogiyaa handunaganu laebuwe koheda?,"The correct answer is **A: pranshaya (France)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...naegenahira pranshaye liyon asala vagurubimaka miya gos..."" which translates to ""...currently, cases of bird flu have been reported in France...""

Therefore, France is the country mentioned as having cases of the H5N1 virus.



"
saama sadhaka bhatayan wisin wu roga wyaapthiyata pera hayitiye mema rogaya awasan warata hamu wuye kawadada?,"The correct answer is **C: bhoomikampawata pera** (due to the earthquake).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""2010 bhumikampaaven pasu hayiti wetha paemini e.ja. saama saadhaka hamudaavata dos pawaranu laebe."" (Following the 2010 earthquake, Haiti received aid from the U.S. and other aid organizations.)  This establishes a direct link between the earthquake and the outbreak/spread of the disease.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 1800 ganan waladee** (1800 counts/numbers) - This refers to the number of cases related to the disease, not the *cause* of its spread.
* **B: hamuda paemineemata tika kalakata pera** (due to aid distribution) - While aid distribution *could* contribute to spread, the text doesn't say this is the primary reason. It focuses on the earthquake disrupting systems.
* **D: 2009 dee** (in 2009) -  The passage specifically refers to events *after* the 2010 earthquake.



"
rogaya paethireema sandaha dayaka wu apadrawya kumana sthaanayen vida?,"The correct answer is **B: eksath jatheenge kandawura** (the Artibonite River valley).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...eksath jatinge kandavurin pita vena apedrawya nisilesa visabijaharanayata lak kara naethi baevin, hayitiye visaalatama gangaa athara ekak wana aatibonaite gange atugangaavalata baekteria aetulu wee aetha.""  This translates to: ""...no measures were taken to purify the water coming from the Artibonite River valley, and bacteria entered the largest river in Haiti, the Artibonite River.""

Therefore, the origin of the cholera outbreak is linked to contaminated water from the Artibonite River valley.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: aartibonayit gaga** - While the Artibonite River is mentioned, the *valley* is the source, not just the river itself.
*   **C: 2010 bhoomikampawa sidu wu sthaanaya** - The 2010 earthquake is mentioned as a context, but isn't the *source* of the cholera. It created conditions that made the outbreak worse, but the bacteria came from elsewhere.
*   **D: yukthiya ha p‍rajathanth‍ravadaya sandaha wu hayiti aayathanaya** - This refers to Haiti's political system and isn't related to the physical source of the disease.

ayarlantha rajaya kumak kirimata saelasumkara thibeda?,"The correct answer is **B: mathdrawya walata awasara deema sambandhayen daedi neethi handunva deema** (issuing a code of conduct regarding opportunities for financial gain).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P)** discusses a situation where a state publisher stated that parliamentary procedures for making laws were insufficient. He also mentions concerns about ethical conduct related to public welfare and criminal justice. Importantly, he highlights a situation where individuals are using their positions to exploit opportunities for financial gain and suggests a need for rules concerning *subhasaadhanaya saha mathdrawya sambandha dandana pilibanda soukya amaathyavaraya* –  facilities and punishments related to financial connections. This directly implies a need for a code of conduct to address potential conflicts of interest and corruption.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mathdrawya javarama sambandha ayata waradkaruwan kirima** (taking action against those involved in financial fraud) - While this might be a *result* of better regulations, the passage focuses on *preventing* the issues, not just punishing them.
* **C: mathdrawya walata awasara deema sambandhayen neethi lihil kirima** (writing laws regarding opportunities for financial gain) - The passage implies *already existing* laws are insufficient; it's a *code of conduct* within the existing framework that's needed.
* **D: mathdrawya thahanama iwath kirima** (stopping financial transactions) - This is too broad and doesn't address the core issue of ethical conduct and potential abuse of power.

**Therefore, option B best reflects the essence of the publisher's suggestion for improving the state’s system.**



"
ayarlanthaye thawakaalikawa neeth‍yaanukula wuye kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: mathdrawya (assets/property)**.

Here's the breakdown of why, based on the provided text:

* **The text states:** ""...adaala drawyavala thaavakalika nityaanukulabhaavayen prayojana ganna pudgalayange subhasaadhanaya saha **mathdrawya sambandha dandana** pilibanda soukya amaathyavaraya kanassalla pala kaleya.""
* **Translation:** ""...over a few periods, there were discussions regarding the welfare of individuals utilizing state resources temporarily and the penalties related to **assets/property**...""

The text directly links the temporary use of state resources (which is the context of ""ayarlanthaye thawakaalikawa neeth‍yaanukula wuye"") with penalties relating to *mathdrawya* (assets/property). Therefore, *mathdrawya* is the correct answer.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sorakam kirima (to commit theft):** While potentially related to misuse of resources, it’s not the direct focus of the sentence.
*   **B: wanchaawa (desire/wish):** This doesn't relate to the context of penalties and resource use.
*   **C: paharadeema (guardianship):** This is irrelevant to the passage's discussion.



"
saeka katayuthu waradkaru sambandhawa wimarshanaya karanne kumak pilibandawa da?,"The correct answer is **A: anawasarayen aethulu vima**.

Here's why:

* **P's statement** discusses a critique (""vimarsana"") regarding unnecessary accidents (""anawasarayen aetulu"") related to the release of a book by Kristopher Garcia.  The passage focuses on the potential for destruction (""depala vinaasha"") caused by these accidents.
* **Q's question** asks *what* the critique is about.
* **Option A (""anawasarayen aethulu vima"")** directly addresses the focus of the critique - unnecessary accidents.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: bhawthika haaniya (physical damage):** While mentioned, it's a *result* of the accidents, not the core focus of the critique.
* **C: winashakaaree kriyaa (destructive acts):**  Similar to B, it's a consequence, not the subject of the critique itself.
* **D: sorakama (noise):** This is irrelevant to the passage.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer as it directly reflects the subject of the critique mentioned in the original statement (P)."
"lakuna wenas karana wita, saekakaru nokale kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: eyata bhawthikawa haani kirima** (It caused physical harm to it).

Here's the breakdown of the passage and why:

* **P** describes a situation where someone named Kristopher Garshiya published something that led to the destruction of a department.  Crucially, it states: ""**Lakunata bhautikava haani nowee ya**"" - ""There was no physical damage.""  However, it *then* says that despite this lack of physical harm, people were affected and changed, likened to editing a word with ""o"" to ""e"".

* **Q** asks what happened *because* of the gap/lack (lakuna).

*  The passage explains the gap *caused* physical harm, despite it *not* being directly stated in the earlier portion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ehi ek akurak wenas kirima** (There was an inaccuracy made here) - While the passage hints at something being amiss, it doesn't directly state an inaccuracy.
* **B: saamaya lakunakin eya alankaara kirima** (It decorated the gap) - This makes no sense in the context.
* **D: eya wenas kirimata taarpawlin bhawitha kirima** (It encouraged tarpaulin to do it) - Completely unrelated to the passage's meaning.



Therefore, **C** is the most logical answer, as it reflects the consequence of the ""lakuna"" - physical harm despite an initial statement to the contrary."
"mema chedayata anuwa, ingreesi guruwarayaa wana kaanota chodna nokarana ladde pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: sisuwiyaka samaga pem sabandathawak paevaethvima** (engaging in love affairs with students).

Here's why:

The passage describes the English teacher as having ""satahanvala samahara demaapiyan ashlila yaeyi saelaku wachana adanggu woo athara pantiyedi"" (many scandalous affairs and inappropriate relationships with students). It also mentions ""sisunge mituraa menma ohu panthiye dee graamya wachana bhavitha kala bawath, satahan wala prema kusalataa igaenvu bawath"" (""students say he behaves intimately with girls and has many love affairs"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: prakaashana himikam ullanghanaya kirima** (violating publication rules) - While mentioned, it's a secondary issue compared to the allegations of misconduct.
* **C: anawasara welanda daenvim mudranaya kirima** (printing unauthorized land permits) - This is also a side detail and not the primary accusation.
* **D: panthiyedee ashishta bhashawa bhawitha kirima** (using indecent language in class) -  This is mentioned as part of his problematic behavior but doesn't represent the most serious allegation.



Therefore, the most prominent and direct accusation against the English teacher, based on the provided text, is his inappropriate relationships with students."
"mema chedayata anuwa, rolaendo mendosa wisin p‍rana aepayata ganu nolaebuwe kawuda?","The correct answer is **A: sanchaarakayin** (journalist).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hitapu pilipina polis niladhaariyeku honkon sanchaarakayin praana aepayata thabaa gene aeththe...""  This translates to ""A Philippine police officer allegedly shot and killed a Hong Kong journalist...""  It then details Ronaldo Mendoza shooting *the journalist* with an M16 rifle. 

Therefore, Ronaldo Mendoza killed a journalist.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, kalin nidhaskara aethi bawa thahawuru nowu p‍rana aepakaruwan kawuda?","The correct answer is **C: chayaarupa shilpeen (film/cinema artist)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pilipina chaayaarupa shilpin men lamun saha vaedihitiyan aetulu praana aepakaruvan hiya deneku kalin nidahas karana ladi."" This translates to: ""Pilipino film artists and technicians were tasked with creating a cinematic version of the victim's story."" 

The question asks who was tasked with creating a cinematic version. Therefore, the answer is the film artists.

"mema chedayata anuwa, b‍raseelaye samalingika wivaha neethigatha kirimata sahaya dakwamin athsan raes karanne kawuda?","The correct answer is **A: wirodhathakaruwan (the opposition)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Virodhaya pala karannan novaembar maasaye dee jaathika congrasayata idiripath kirimata athsan miliyana 1.2 k res kirimata balaaporottu wethi.""  This translates to: ""The opposition organized a demonstration of 1.2 million people to try and prevent the legalization in the national congress in November.""

Therefore, the opposition is the group actively working against the legalization of same-sex marriage in Brazil, according to the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: roberto jefarsan (Roberto Jefferson):**  He is mentioned as supporting the proposed policy and amendments, not opposing the legalization.
* **C: romanu katholika palliya (Roman Catholic Church):** The text states the Roman Catholic Church *opposes* same-sex marriage but doesn't say they organized the demonstration.
* **D: martha sapleesee (Martha Suplicy):** She is mentioned in relation to proposing the policy, not leading the opposition.



"
wirodhathakaruwan thama pethsama idiripath karanne kaatada?,"The correct answer is **A: Romanu Katholika Palliya (Roman Catholic Church)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""romaanu katolika rata brasilaya wana athara, romaanu katolika sabhaava ema rata thula sama lingika vivaha kireema sandaha digatama viruddha wee atha.""  This translates to ""Brazil, a Roman Catholic country, and the Roman Catholic faith in that country are against same-sex marriage in any way.""  The text then describes opposition to the bill, and this opposition stems from the Roman Catholic Church's stance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Roberto Jefferson:** He is mentioned as supporting the proposed policy and amendments, not leading the opposition.
*   **C: Brasilaye Jaathika Kongrasaya (Brazilian National Congress):** The Congress is *considering* the bill, not necessarily leading the opposition.
*   **D: Sao Paulo Nagaradhipathi (Sao Paulo Mayor):**  The text does not mention the Sao Paulo mayor's involvement.

"aamand warsache ge ginumata anuwa, minisun kaalaguna wenas vimata p‍rathichaara daekvimata perathuwa sidu vi aeththe kumakda?","Let's break down the question and the provided text to find the best answer.

**Understanding the Text (P):**

The text is a somewhat poetic and fragmented description of a journey, loss, and a sense of detachment. Key themes include:

* **A difficult journey:** Mention of minutes passing, 70 kilometers covered.
* **Loss and memory:**  Refers to someone who is no longer present (""inpasu varssava paemine,"" meaning ""after years of being gone"").  The speaker is trying to understand/indicate something about their past with this person.
* **Cold and isolation:** ""inpasu hima kaeta vaessa ahasin kadaa waete"" (the sky was covered in cold snow).  Describes being alone with thoughts and feelings.
* **Detachment from humanity:**  ""minisun biyen gaehemin saha kaegasamin, ekinekaa paagamin duwannata patan ganee"" (people live within their heads and desires, falling into loneliness).  The speaker feels separate.
* **Lack of empathy/connection:** ""mata mage soyuriya saha aege mituriya nathi vuna"" (I have no joy or the other person's friendship).

**Understanding the Question (Q):**

""According to the text, what caused people to fall into a state of loneliness and disconnect, leading to negative consequences?""  Essentially, what's the root cause of the isolation described?

**Analyzing the Options:**

* **A: ahasin hima kaeta vaeteema aarambha wiya (the beginning was covered in cold snow):**  The snow is a *symbol* of the isolation, but it's not the *cause* of it. It's a setting element.
* **B: sandarshanaya winadi pahak p‍ramada wiya (the journey began with danger):** The journey is part of the narrative, but the danger isn't explicitly linked to the deeper isolation.
* **C: daedi sulan haemeeya (they were lost in dreams):** This is a possible interpretation, but not strongly supported in the text.
* **D: ohuta pawule samajikayekwa maga haerini (they walked the path of a ruined society):**  This is the *closest* answer. The text states ""minisun biyen gaehemin saha kaegasamin, ekinekaa paagamin duwannata patan ganee"" (people live within their heads and desires, falling into loneliness). This suggests a societal or cultural problem – people are self-absorbed and disconnected, leading to a ""ruined"" or fragmented social state. This is the root of the loneliness.

**Therefore, the correct answer is D: ohuta pawule samajikayekwa maga haerini.**



"
"warsacheta anuwa, wada daedi sulan aarambha wuye kawadada?","The correct answer is **A: sandarshanaya aarambha vi miniththu kihipayakata pasu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sandarsanayata minittu pahak thibiyadi sulangak hamaa yannata patan ganee..."" (The journey begins with a minute's delay for the sightseeing trip...)
* This directly indicates the journey/trip (sandarshanaya) starts after a minute's delay.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: vaessen pasuwa:** (After the rain) The passage mentions rain, but doesn't say the journey *starts* after the rain.
* **C: ohuta thama sahodriya ahimi wu pasu:** (After his own brother wasn't there) This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: hima kaeta warshawata pera:** (After the snow and years) While snow and time are mentioned, they don't mark the *start* of the journey.

"f‍red ta pera, batahira anshaka 35ta naegenahirin p‍radhaana kunatu keeyak vaartha vi thibeda?","The question asks: ""Regarding Fred, what is the main reason for the 35th section of the southwest?""

The passage states: ""Chandrika rupa soyaa gaeneeme sita dakunu saha naegenahira athlaanthik kalaapaye methek vaartha woo prabalatama nivartana suli sulanga wana fred, 35 w hi naegenahira vaartha woo thewana pradhaanathama chanda maaruthaya wei.""  This translates to: ""Fred, who strongly diverted due to the south and southeast Atlantic areas, particularly due to the 35th section of the southeast winds.""

Therefore, the main reason for the 35th section (of the southwest/southeast) is the **winds**.

The answer is **B: thideneku** (winds).



"
f‍red kep werd doopath asala sitina wita eya gaman kale kumana dishawata da?,"The correct answer is **D: wayamba desata**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Fred me wana vita paeyakata saethapum 105 ka (paeyata kilo meetara 165) wegayen hamana sulang sahitava **vayamba desata gaman karamin sitiyi**."" 

This translates to: ""Fred, after leaving this forest, started traveling towards the **northwestern region** at a speed of 105 km (165 kilometers).""

Therefore, Fred traveled towards the northwestern region.



"
ehi purogameenta wada vaedi wegayak aethi pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""802.11n hi vegayan tha.me.bi 600 ka saiddhaantika uparima vegayak aethi ehi purogaaminta vadaa saelakiya yuthu tharamin vadaa vegavat we.""  This translates to ""802.11n is faster, with a theoretical maximum speed of 600, and is faster than older standards.""

The question asks which standard is *faster* in this context. Therefore, 802.11n is the correct answer.
"
802.11b samaga pasupasata anukula vimata 802.11n sandaha awashya wana kondesi monavada?,"The correct answer is **D: dwithwa rediyo** (dual radio).

Here's why:

* **The question asks about compatibility with 802.11b.** The passage states that if a device has dual radios, it can be compatible with older standards like 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g.  802.11n supports these older standards *through* the use of dual radios.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: wada saelakiya yuthu wegayak (high speed)** - While 802.11n *is* faster, the question is specifically about *compatibility* with 802.11b.
* **B: 802.11b sandaha 5.0Ghz matha kriyaa kirime haekiyaawa (802.11b operates on 5.0Ghz)** - 802.11b operates on 2.4GHz, not 5.0GHz.
* **C: 600Mbit/s ka p‍rathidanaya (600Mbit/s is the specification)** - This is the *potential* speed of 802.11n, but doesn't answer the question about compatibility with the older 802.11b standard.

poduraajya mandaleeya kreeda ulele olimpik ran padkkam labhiyaa pihinum isaw keeyaka sahabhagee wida?,"The question asks: ""In the inter-state sports meet, how many participants received Olympic running medals?""

The passage (P) states the athlete *qualified* for the 100m and 200m races, and *could* participate in the Olympics. However, it **does not state they *won* any medals** in the inter-state meet. It specifically says they weren't even considered for selection due to doping suspicions.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: pahaka** (meaning ""none"" or ""zero"" in Sinhala).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: thideneku** (three)
*   **C: dekak** (ten)
*   **D: hathara deneku** (four)

The passage doesn't give any information about medal winners. It only discusses the athlete's potential and the doping allegations.



"
olimpik ran padkkamlabhiyaa ohuge wedanawa sandaha awshadha nogaththe aeyi?,"The correct answer is **A: ohuta kisidu wedanawak nothibuni** (He doesn't need any medicine).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** states that the athlete *doesn't* need doping (prohibited drugs) because their physical fitness is sufficient.  The passage specifically mentions avoiding prohibited drugs at the Olympics and implies their natural ability is enough.
* **Q (the question)** asks if the athlete needs medicine (specifically in the context of competition - implied by asking about an Olympic medalist).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: eya ohuta asaneepa thaththwayak aethi kaleya** (It's better for him to eat a healthy diet) - While healthy eating is good, it doesn't directly answer the question about *medicine* or doping.
* **C: eya ohuge shareera yogyathawayata ahithakara lesa balapanu aethaeyi ohu saelakilimath wiya** (It can strengthen his physical fitness, but he needs to train hard) -  This is about improvement, not a *need* for medicine. The passage suggests he's already fit enough.
* **D: poduraajya mandaleeya kreeda ulele eyata awasara naetha** (There is no opportunity for him in international sports) - This is irrelevant to the question of needing medicine.



Therefore, **A** is the only answer that directly reflects the information provided in the passage."
"mema chedayata anuwa, bhoomikampa kriyaakaarakam pilibanda wyaakulathwayata hethu wiya haekke kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: anduru walakulu thibeema** (three people being missing).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ginikandu kriyaakaaritvayakata kisindu sambandhayak nomaeti anduru valaakulu kanda paamula aethi bhava vaartha viya. Sathya pipirimak sidu vuye da yanna pilibandava vyaakulatavak valaakulu magin penee giye ya.""  This translates to: ""News reports said three people are missing related to the landslide. People were worried about those who disappeared and went searching.""

This clearly establishes the missing people as the source of the anxiety and worry mentioned in the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ayislantha kaalaguna widyaa kaaryaalaye vaarthawa** (news from the Ayislantha time studies office) - This is just a source of information, not the *cause* of the worry.
* **C: jaath‍yanthara bhoomikampa sithiyama** (inter-plate earthquake situation) -  The earthquake itself is the initial event, but the worry is specifically about the people affected *by* it.
* **D: ayislanthaye wenath p‍radeshawala vaartha wu kriyaakaarakam** (actions reported in the affected areas of Ayislantha) - This is too general; the worry is focused on the missing people.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, adiyara wenasak sidu wuye kawadadaa?","The correct answer is **C: marthu 10 wenida** (March 10th).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...bhu kampana kriyaakaarakamak maarthu 10 wana dina ginikandu mudunata kalderavehi eesaana desin siduwee aetha.""  This translates to ""...the earthquake activity is expected to subside within 10 days from March 10th in the eastern region.""

Therefore, the question ""When will it subside?"" is answered by ""March 10th"".

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""thatparayakata kilo meetars 1.5 ka (paeyakata saethapum 3000) wegayen sada muhunatha haraha giya chandra ghatana eshanaya (mip) mudhaa harina lada athara eya saarthakava chandrayaage dakshina draevaya asannayata kada vaetuni.""  This translates to: ""...after being launched at a distance of 1.5 kilometers (with an accuracy of 3000), it revealed important findings about the south pole of the moon.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: gaweshana yaanaya diyath kala kak‍shayata kaarya mandalayak sitayeya** (The research vehicle was controlled by a command center after being launched into orbit) - The passage doesn't focus on *how* it was controlled, but *what* it found.
* **B: gaweshana yaanaye vaedgath upakarana thibuni** (The research vehicle had scientific instruments) - While true, this isn't the *new discovery* being highlighted. The passage simply mentions it *had* instruments.
* **D: gaweshana yaanaye paata kala paethi thibuni** (The research vehicle had a picture taken) - The passage mentions a national flag, but doesn't emphasize picture-taking as the main achievement.



Therefore, option C best reflects the main point of the passage - Chandrayaan-1 made significant discoveries."

* **The passage states:** ""Minisun rahitha chandrayaan -1 chandra kakshagatha yaanaya...mip mudhaa harina lada athara eya saarthakava chandrayaage dakshina draevaya asannayata kada vaetuni."" (The unmanned Chandrayaan-1 lunar orbiter...released a lunar impact probe which successfully landed near the south pole of the moon.)

* **Option C** directly reflects this information - ""eya minisun sahitha kak‍shayakin muda harina ladee"" translates to ""it released an impact probe with the orbiter.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eya chandrayaage uthuru dhraewayata aasannawa goda baesseya** - The passage states it landed near the *south* pole, not the north.
* **B: ehi hadisi godabaema saarthaka wiya** - This is a vague statement and doesn't relate to the specific event described.
* **D: eya vaedgath upakarana dekak raegena yamin thibuni** - While the passage mentions scientific instruments, it doesn't say they were *brought back* to Earth.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, awasana washayen kriyaathmaka karanu labana roga vaelaekvime piyawara wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: enseflayitis ennath**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly mentions ""ensepalities ennath kuppi miliyana gananavak labadimata rajaya ekagha wee aetha"" (millions of cases of encephalitis have been reported across the country). It also discusses the impact of the disease and preventative measures.  The text links this disease to the areas affected and the resulting damage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: palibodhanashaka (palibodha naashaka isimin)** - This refers to *destruction of knowledge*, a consequence of the disease impacting children and education, but isn't the disease itself.
* **B: pig kaechar (pig kaechar yedavima waeni kriyaa maarga gaenimata katayutu salasvana ladi)** - This refers to the *method of transmission* (pig farming/behavior) associated with the disease, not the disease itself.
* **D: maduru dael (maduru dhael dahas gananin beda harimin)** -  This refers to *deaths* caused by the disease, not the disease itself.



Therefore, **ensefalitis** (or ""enseflayitis ennath"" as written in the text) is the disease being discussed."
mema rogaya minisunta samp‍reshanaya wanne keseda?,"The correct answer is **A: maduruwangen** (mosquitoes).

Here's why:

The text states: ""mema rogaya uran magin **sampreshanaya karanu labana athara pasuwa maduruvan** haraha minisun wetha aasaadanaya we.""  This translates to ""This disease is spread by flies and **mosquitoes** affecting humans.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: palibodhanashaka (environmental factors)** - While environmental factors can *contribute* to disease spread, the text specifically names mosquitoes as a direct vector.
* **C: oorangen (insects)** - This is too broad.  Mosquitoes are a specific type of insect.
* **D: pig kaechar (pig feces)** - The text mentions pig feces in a different context related to sanitation and disease prevention, not as the direct method of transmission.



"
dewana waganthiye asaarthakathwaya hethu wiya haekke kumana p‍rathiphalayata da?,"The correct answer is **B: samalingika siwil ekathuvimwala anagatha ayithivasikamak** (the future uncertainty of same-sex civil unions).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Samalingika sivil ekathu vim thahanam kirimata yojanaa kala devana waakyaya asaarthaka weema magin, idiriyedee sivil ekathu vimvalata dora vivara viya haeka."" This translates to: ""The statement of the planned legislation to ban same-sex civil unions was deemed meaningless, as the future of civil unions was unclear.""
* This directly indicates the uncertainty surrounding same-sex civil unions is the *reason* the original statement (the plan to ban them) became meaningless.  The devana waganthiya (government statement) became irrelevant *because* the future of these unions was uncertain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: HJR-3 pilibanda k‍shanika samalochanayata lak kere** (Focused on a brief consultation on HJR-3) - While HJR-3 is mentioned, it's a *result* of the uncertainty, not the reason *for* the statement's meaninglessness.
* **C: hadisi vyavasthaadayaka saesivarayak** (Amendments to existing systems) - This is too broad and not directly related to the statement in the passage.
* **D: samalingika siwil ekathuvim thahanam kirima** (Banning same-sex civil unions) - This is the *attempted* action, but the uncertainty about the future is why that attempt became inconsequential.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, dewana waganthiya makaa daemuwe kawadada?","The correct answer is **A: vyavasthaadayaka saesiya atharathura** (the relevant committee).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Niyojitha manthri mandalaya visin palamuwa devana waganthiya makaa damanu laebiimen pasuwa mema niti sampaadana saesiyata venas kireemak sidu karana lada athara inpasu e aakarayenma senat mandalaya visin sanduda anumatha karana ladi."" 

This translates to: ""This policy was sent to the Senate for approval in eight ways, including through a committee relevant to the proposed cabinet of ministers.""  Therefore, the *waganthiya makaa damanu* (committee) is the relevant entity mentioned in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 2011 dee** - This refers to a year when a decision was made, not the committee itself.
*   **C: sanduda** - This means ""approval"" and is an action, not an entity.
*   **D: 2015 dee** - This is another year mentioned in the passage, related to action taken later, not the initial committee review.



"
“paenama path‍rikaa” anawaranaya wuye kaa hatada?,"The correct answer is **A: mosaek fonsekaa samagama**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""paenama pathrika"""" yanu 2016 vasantayedi **paenamaa niti samaagamak wana mosaek fonseka** wethin maadhyata anaavaranaya woo dhala washayen..."" 

This directly translates to ""The 'Panama Papers' were revealed in the spring of 2016 through the media with the help of **Mosaic Fonseca's** association...""

Therefore, Mosaic Fonseca's association is the entity that revealed the ""Panama Papers.""

This translates to: ""British former officials and Guardian investigations revealed that this operation was directly carried out by **German banks**.""

The question asks which organization was involved in facilitating financial transactions, particularly from Britain. The passage directly identifies ""doyish baenkuwa"" (German banks) as playing that role.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: wiwidha baenku wala dhanawath sevadayakayin** (various banks' wealth services) - This is too general. The text specifies *German* banks.
*   **B: paenama neethi samagama** (Panama Ethics Committee) - This is the organization investigating, not facilitating transactions.
*   **D: paakisthana rajaya** (Pakistan state) - Pakistan is mentioned in the context of leaders being named in the leaks, not as a facilitator of financial dealings.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pasugiya maasaye dee aameniyaava balaa yamin sity guvan yaanayak anaturata lakweemen vasara gananak thula sidu woo darunuthama guvan vyasanayata iraanaya muhuna dunne ehi sity 168 deneku jivitaksayata path karamini.""  This translates to ""During the past month, a passenger plane that took off from Armenia's capital, Yerevan, crashed in Iran, resulting in the loss of life of 168 people."" 

This directly links the crash to a plane traveling *from* Armenia (Yerevan) *to* Iran.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: polis helikoptar yaanaya anathurata lak wiya** - The passage mentions a police helicopter *after* the crash, responding to the scene, not crashing.
* **C: aarmeniyaawe sita iranayata yana atharamagadee yaanaya anathurata lak wiya** - While the plane was traveling *towards* Iran, the key detail is it originated from Yerevan.
* **D: mashhad hi guwan yaanaya anathurata lak wiya** -  Mashhad is mentioned as a location, but the passage doesn't state the plane crashed *in* Mashhad, only in Iran.

iranaye siduwana guwan anathuru bahulavimata hethuwak nowanne pahatha sandahan karunu walin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: paerani siwil ha hamuda guwan yaana thogayak thibeema** (the old fleet of civilian and cargo transport vehicles).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Guvan anaturu sivil saha hamuda meheyum yana dekama sandaha durvala lesa nadattu kerena parana guvanyaana togayak aethi iraanaye podu deyaki."" This translates to ""The old fleet of civilian and cargo transport vehicles were causing many accidents due to their poor condition, leading to a large number of complaints.""

The question asks what caused the increase in accidents. The passage directly links the accidents to the *old fleet* of civilian and cargo vehicles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: nawa guwan yaana miladee gaeneema sandaha ayavaeya nomaethikama** (The new fleet of transport vehicles does not have sufficient safety features) - The passage doesn't mention any issues with the *new* fleet, only the old one.
*   **C: nawa guwan yaana miladee gaeneema walakwana jaath‍yanthara thahanam** (The new fleet of transport vehicles is covered by an insurance scheme) -  Insurance is not mentioned as a cause of accidents.
*   **D: durwala lesa nadaththukarana lada guwan yaana thogayak thibeema** (The existence of a fleet of vehicles operating in poor condition) - While true, this is a restatement of *part* of the problem, not the primary cause identified in the question. The question asks *what* led to the increase, and the answer is the old fleet itself.

iraaka adhyayana kandayame vaarthawata aethulath kara nomaeththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: yam yam wenaskam samaga irakaye wardhanaya wana p‍rachandathwaya walakva gatha haeki bawata p‍rakaashayak** (roughly translates to: how the increasing intensity/severity with the study of Iraq has impacted the country).

Here's why:

* **The passage heavily focuses on the increasing challenges and instability Iraq faces as it's studied and analyzed.** It describes a worsening situation, a sense of anxiety, and a lack of positive outcomes despite efforts. The phrase ""vardhanaya wana prachandatvayak"" (increasing intensity/severity) is central to this idea.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: wathman p‍rathipaththiya wiwechanaya kirima** (conducting a review of current practices) - The passage *mentions* current practices, but isn't primarily *about* reviewing them.
* **C: iarakaye deshaseema surak‍shitha kirima sandaha wana nirdesha** (instructions on securing Iraq's borders) - Border security is a *part* of the context (mentioned with the 78 instructions), but not the main focus.
* **D: eksath janapada podu ekagathawak sandaha aayaachanayak** (a request for a unified public gathering) - This is briefly mentioned as something *resulting* from the situation, but isn't the core topic of the passage.

Therefore, option B best captures the central theme of the provided text.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Me anuva iraqaye siduvana onaema kriyaakaarakam maalaavak nikaayavadi ranakaamayak, vardhanaya wana prachandatvayak ho vyaakulatvaya desata aedi yamak navatvana bavata kisivekuta sahatika kala nohaeki bhava emagin anaturu angavayi.""  This translates to: ""This situation in Iraq is characterized by a worsening security situation and an increase in brutality and intolerance, leading to a state where no one feels safe or secure.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: k‍shanikawa dishawa wenas kirima (focusing on momentary directions):** The passage discusses a broader, worsening situation, not temporary directions.
* **C: wiwurtha wivada bhawitha kirima (creating controversial disputes):** While the passage mentions disputes, it focuses on the *result* of those disputes - brutality - rather than the disputes themselves.
* **D: nawa thanapathi kriyaamarga gaeneema (considering new presidential paths):**  This is mentioned towards the end, as a *potential* future outcome, not the main observation highlighted at the beginning.



Therefore, option A accurately reflects the primary concern expressed in the initial part of the passage."
"polisiyata anuwa, prowensanoge dakunath minisa lesa salakanu laebuwe kawuda?","The correct answer is **B: lo pikkoolo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Polisiya paevasu paridi paelarmohidee provensanoge dakunu atha men sity baevin low pikolo mehi pradhaanathvaya ganna athara...""  This translates to ""...The police forces, especially in the southern part of Palermo province, began to give priority to the young Picciolo...""

Therefore, Lo Picciolo is identified as a figure involved in the southern part of Palermo, and the question asks who the police were looking for in the south.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: jiyovani faelkooni** - Mentioned in relation to a past mafia war, not the current police focus in the south.
*   **C: aansa** - Appears at the very beginning of the text and isn't connected to the specific police action in Palermo's south.
*   **D: pawulo borselino** - Also mentioned regarding a past conflict and isn't the current focus of the police.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""1992 dee mafia kurusa yuddha bhatayan wana geovani falcon saha pavulo borselinoge jivita biligath rajayata erehi rayina visin meheyavana lada yuddhaya avasan karana vita provensano visin mema pradhanin nawatha sevaye yodava tibuni.""  This translates to: ""Provensano died serving as a new leader in the fight against the Mafia that ended the war begun by Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, who sacrificed their lives in 1992 fighting the Mafia.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: reena wisin meheyawana lada yuddhayedee ohu mara damana ladee** (He was killed in the war against the Mafia) - While true, it doesn't state *who* killed him.
* **B: ohu polisiya wisin ghaathanaya karana ladee** (He was killed by the police) - The passage indicates the opposite; he was fighting *with* the authorities.
* **C: lo pikkoolota ohuwa mara daemeemata niyoga karana ladee** (He was hired to be killed by Lo Piccolo) - The passage doesn't mention Lo Piccolo being responsible for his death.



"
hitoshi sayitoge sammana walin ekak nowanne pahatha sandahan karunu walin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: samastha japana judo sammelanaye kamitu sabhapathi** (President of the All Japan Judo Federation).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hitapu olympik ha loka shurayaku da woo saito miya yana vita samastha japaana judo kamituve sammelanaye puhunu kamituve sabhaapativarayaava sitiye ya.""  This translates to ""After being an Olympic medalist and world champion, he also served as the President of the All Japan Judo Federation.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: loka shoorathawa dewarak (World champion)** - While he *was* a world champion, the question asks about a position he *held* as a tribute.
*   **C: dewarak olimpik ran padkkamlabhee (Olympic medalist)** - He *was* an Olympic medalist, but again, the question seeks a position he held.
*   **D: judo wisheshanga (Judo expert)** - While implied, it's not a specific role/title mentioned in relation to the tribute.

Question (Q) asks: ""Where did the group stop after traveling with Tharjana?""

Since the passage states they went *through* India to reach somewhere else, and Nepal is mentioned as the starting point and India as a transit point, the logical answer is **C: Indiyaawa (India)**.  They stopped *in* India after traveling with Tharjana.

Therefore, the answer is **C**.



"
ivasakita pahara dunne kawuda?,"The correct answer is **C: ballek**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""...tibetaye dee viyaru balleku visin pahara denu laeba..."" which translates to ""...he gave blows from the Tibetan army.""

Therefore, the ones who gave the blows (pahara denu laeba) are the **ballek** (army).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ohuge anagatha kalath‍rayaa** (his future wife) - The passage doesn't mention his wife giving blows.
*   **B: muhudu kollakaruwan** (sea robber) - The passage says he *was* a sea robber, not that he gave blows *as* one.
*   **D: polisiya** (police) - The passage doesn't mention the police.



"
aelonso ohuge dhaawana tharagaya awasan kale kawadada?,"The correct answer is **C: shumakar ohugema dhaawana tharagaya awasan kirimen pasu** (Shumakar finished the race after Alonso).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mayikal shoomaakar, alonsota pasuwa waedi kaalayak gatha weemata pera tharagaya avasan kale...""  This translates to ""Finally, Shumakar finished the race after the time Alonso took to finish.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: shoomakar idiripasa rodayata haani kala pasu** (Shumakar lost due to a tire issue) - The passage mentions tire issues but doesn't link it directly to Shumakar's finish *after* Alonso.
* **B: fisichela ta ohuge motar rathaye palanaya ahimi wiya** (Fisichela didn't operate his motor car) - This is irrelevant to the question about Alonso's race finish and Shumakar.
* **D: peramuna gaeneemata pera** (Before the front) -  This doesn't relate to the order in which Alonso and Shumakar finished.



"

The passage states: ""Mayikal shoomaakar, alonsota pasuwa waedi kaalayak gatha weemata pera tharagaya avasan kale, tharagaya thula pawathi tharangakari satan gananaavakin pasuwa avalambanayata sidu woo haaniyana nisaaveni.""  This translates to: ""Eventually, the race ended before Shoomakar could catch up to Alonso, losing due to relying on the motor vehicle's capabilities.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ohuge motar rathaye palanaya naethi wiya** (due to not being able to control his motor vehicle) - The passage doesn't mention a lack of control, but a reliance *on* the vehicle.
* **B: aelonso samaga gaeteemak** (competing with Alonso) - While Alonso is mentioned, the reason for Shoomakar's loss isn't simply *competing* with him.
* **C: fishichella nisa rodyata sidu wu haaniya** (losing the road due to Fisichella) - Fisichella isn't mentioned as a factor in Shoomakar's loss.

"mema chedayata anuwa, ath adanguwata path wuwan sandaha aepa labaa gaeneema wuye kaage wagakeemak da?","The correct answer is **A: ath adanguwata gaeneeme niladhaariyaa** (the commissioner of examinations).

Here's why:

The passage states the commissioner of examinations needs to give permission for the centralized booking system and to issue instructions regarding it. The question asks who needs to approve and issue instructions.  Therefore, the commissioner of examinations is the answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: winisuru glin:** (disciplinary glean) - This refers to a review, not someone who approves.
* **C: madhyama wenkirime pahasukama:** (medium-term benefits) - This is a benefit, not a person.
* **D: adhikarana komasariswarayaa:** (authority commissioner) - While similar, the passage specifically refers to the *commissioner of examinations* (""adhikarana komasaarisvarayeku"") who is responsible for the task.

The passage states: ""...komasaarisvaraya visin aepa panawanu labana athara ath adangguvata gaenimata katayutu kala niladhaariya visin kala chodana vidhimat karanu atha.""  This directly translates to ""...to obtain permission from the Commissioner to issue a call for applications from those over 80 years of age to fill the relevant positions through a formal process.""

The question asks what kind of request is being made, given the passage's context of needing to fill positions. ""Aepa"" (permission) is the core of that request.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ath adanguwata gath niladhaariyaa samaga hamuwak:**  This refers to being with the relevant responsible person, but isn't the *request* itself.
* **C: winisuru glin wisin nikuth karana lada nila chodna:** This refers to cancelling a previous notice, which isn't the primary action being discussed.
* **D: nadu wibhaagayak:** This is a department, not a request.

"mema chedayata anuwa, awalangu karana maethivaranaya paehaedili kirimata bhaavitha nokarana lada hethuwa kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: aarakshaka awadaanam (security concerns)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states that the main reason for the Taliban's resurgence in Afghanistan was due to ""thavat maetivaranayaka viyadama saha **aarakshaka avadaanama**"" – meaning the weakness of the government and **security concerns**.  It highlights that these concerns led to the Taliban taking control.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: aandukrama vyawasthaawe parasparathaawak (internal system conflicts):** While conflicts existed, the passage focuses on security as the primary driver.
* **C: adhika viyadam (excessive spending):** The passage mentions the government was weak and spent excessively, but this is presented *as a result* of the underlying issues, not the core *reason* for the Taliban's return.
* **D: vyavasthaave bahu arthathaawa (economic problems of the system):** Economic difficulties are mentioned, but again, these contribute to weakness, rather than *being* the main reason for the Taliban’s rise.

Question (Q) directly asks for the *reason* for the failure of the government, and the passage clearly identifies security concerns as that primary reason.



"
awasanaye raajya thanthrikayan visin mema maethivaranaya anawashya ekak lesa salakanu laebuwe aeyi?,"The question (Q) asks if this intelligence operation was necessary at all given the state of the government. 

The passage (P) states: ""Adhavaavaya anavasya bata teerana kirimata afghan vyavasthaava bahu arthathaaven yuthu bhava thaman soyaagat bhava raajatantrikayo paevasuha."" This translates to: ""Because the danger could be overcome without necessity, the Afghan system was approaching collapse, being a struggling republic.""

This directly implies the operation *wasn't* necessary because the Afghan system was already failing.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: vyavasthaave bahu arthathawak thibuni** (the system was collapsing/struggling).  It's the only option that reflects the context provided in the passage.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eya vyavasthaavata patahaeni viya:** (It was revealed by the system) - This doesn't address the *necessity* of the operation.
* **B: aarakshaka avadaanamak thibuni:** (the security concerns were stopped) - While the operation might have *aimed* to stop security concerns, the passage doesn't suggest it was necessary to do so.
* **D: maethivarana viyadam itha waedi viya:** (the intelligence information was accurate) -  Accuracy is irrelevant to whether the operation was *needed*.



"
FATA sandaha adhikarana sewa sapayanne kawuda?,"The correct answer is **B: deshapalana niyojithayan** (deshapaalana niyojitayan).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...pradeshayanhi purna svaadhina paalanayakata aasanna paalanayak kriyaatmaka karana pudgalayin hevat """"deshapaalana niyojitayan"""" path kara thibe. mema niyojitayan paakisthana vyavasthaave 247 wana waganthiya yatathe raajya saha adhikarana sevaa saepayimata vaga kiyanu labayi.""

This translates to: ""...the individuals actively implementing governance for full provincial autonomy took the path of """"administrative reorganization"""". This reorganization obtained the approval of 247 clauses in the Pakistani system relating to state and administrative services.""

Therefore, the administrative reorganization (deshapalana niyojitayan) is what obtained the approval for administrative services within FATA.



"
FATA hi “deshapalana niyojithayan” pilibanda pahatha sandahan prakaashayangen sathya nowanne kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: owun adhikarana sewa sapayayi** (it provides administrative services).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""...this arrangement (deshapalana niyojitayan) provided 247 administrative and judicial services..."" This directly links the ""deshapalana niyojitayan"" (FATA administration) to the provision of administrative services.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: owun pakisthana janaadhipathiwaraya visin thoraa pathkara gaene** (it is a short path taken by the Pakistani president) - The passage doesn't mention a 'short path' or direct involvement of the president.
* **C: owun pakisthanaye vyavasthaavata anugatha wethi** (it complies with the Pakistani system) - While it *exists* within Pakistan, the passage doesn't focus on its compliance. It describes its *function*.
* **D: owunta aethaem pradeshawala poorna swadheena palanaya aetha** (it provides full independent governance to those provinces) - The passage implies FATA was *approaching* full independent governance but hadn't yet reached it, and the ""deshapalana niyojitayan"" was a step *towards* that, not providing it directly.



Therefore, **A** is the only option directly supported by the text."
ema ston hata naama yojanaa dena lada sammanaya kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: hondama niliya** (හොඳම නිළිය - Best Actress).

The text states: ""hondama naluva saha niliya lesa piliwelin gosling saha ston ge nam yojanaa viya"" (හොඳම නළුව සහ නිළිය ලෙස පිලිවෙලින් ගොස්ලිං සහ ස්ටෝන්ගේ නම යෝජනා විය) which translates to ""Gosling and Stone were nominated as best actor and **best actress** respectively.""

The question asks what award/recognition Stone received a nomination for. Therefore, the answer is best actress.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Anekuth naama yojana vuye, **hondama chitrapataya**, hondama sinamaakaranaya..."" which translates to ""Many name suggestions came, **best movie**, best director...""  This directly indicates that ""hondama chitrapataya"" was a name considered for the film itself.

The other options are processes *within* filmmaking:

*   **B: hondama drushya prayoga** - best visual effects
*   **C: hondama shabda muhu kirima** - best sound editing
*   **D: hondama mul geethaya** - best original song

The question asks about the film's name consideration, not a specific craft within it.

This translates to: ""The news reports that the earthquake did not cause any damage, but reactors 1 and 2 of the nuclear power plant were put on alert at the Hokuriku Electric Power Company.""

The question asks what was activated/made operational *because* of the earthquake. The passage clearly states the nuclear reactors were put on alert (activated for response).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ishikawa hi guvan thotupala** (Ishikawa's landslides) - While landslides are mentioned as a consequence, they weren't *activated* by the earthquake. They were *caused* by it.
* **C: siyaluma dumriya sewa** (Train services) -  The passage says train services were *disrupted* (baadha wee), not activated.
* **D: neegatha hi balaagarayak** (A damaged building) - The passage specifically states no *damage* occurred.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, bhoomikampawen haaniyata path wuye pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: samahara niwasa (total houses)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kalaapaye nivasa 9400 ta jalaya nomaeti bawath, aasanna washayen nivasa 100 ta viduli balaya nomaeti bawath vaarthaa we."" This translates to ""It is reported that 9400 houses in the area were flooded, and approximately 100 houses lost power.""  This directly relates to damage to houses.
* **The question asks:** about damage caused by the earthquake. Loss of houses is a significant form of damage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: shika balaagaraye prathikriyaakaraka dekak (reactionaries of the education building):** The passage mentions reactions *at* the education building, but doesn't focus on the people themselves as the primary damage.
* **C: samahara maarga (total roads):**  The passage says roads were damaged (""mahaa maarga samaharak haani wee""), but the *primary* impact reported is on homes.
* **D: noto guvan thotupala thawamath (noto guvan totupala thawamath):** This is a specific detail about livestock in Ishikawa Prefecture, not the overarching damage.

"mema chedayata anuwa, lekhanayata aethulath nokarana ladde pahatha sandahan prashnawalin kawareda?","The correct answer is **D: deshaseema pilibanda aarawula** (issues regarding borders/territory).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) focuses entirely on territorial disputes.** It discusses lands acquired in 1967, future Jerusalem, the Jordanian West Bank, and claims to land.  The entire text revolves around *deshaseema* (territory/borders).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: jerusalame anaagathaya (the future of Jerusalem):** While Jerusalem *is* mentioned, it's as part of the larger territorial discussion, not the central question.
* **B: 1967 yuddhayata hethuwa (the reason for the 1967 war):** The passage mentions the 1967 war, but doesn't delve into its *causes*. It uses it as a historical marker for territorial changes.
* **C: nimnaye hamuda yedaweema (the issue of displaced people):** While displacement is implied by territorial changes, it's not the primary focus of the passage.  The passage focuses on *where* the land is, not the people affected by changes to it.

**Therefore, the question (Q) asks what the passage is *about*, and the passage is fundamentally about territorial disputes.**



"
palastheena illeemwalin ekak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: jordan nimnaye daenata pawathina hamuda yedaweema** (the extent of land taken from Jordan).

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""...*enam palastinayata awashya wana paridi 1967 maeda peradiga yuddhayata pere thibu desasima anuva we. Aawaranaya woo anekuth maatrukavalata anuva aetulat vuye ratawal dekatama parisuddha wana anaagata jeruselam praantaya saha jordan nimnaye arbudaya pilibandavayi.*""  This translates to: ""...the area necessary for Palestine, the territory taken during the war before 1967.  This includes the future Jerusalem area and the areas taken from Jordan...""

* **The question (Q) asks:** What was taken by the Palestinian issue?

* **Option B** directly answers this by referring to the land ""taken from Jordan.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: yuddhayata pera thathwayan matha padanam wu deshaseema** (territory lost due to the war) - While the passage mentions war, it doesn't specifically ask about land *lost* but land *taken* in relation to Palestine.
* **C: jerusalame anaagathaya pilibanda wu pilithuru** (information about the future of Jerusalem) -  Jerusalem is mentioned, but the core focus of what was *taken* is the land from Jordan.
* **D: jordan nimnaye wasara pahaka hamuda yedaweemak** (extent of land taken from Jordan in the last ten years) - The passage refers to land taken *before* 1967, not in the last ten years.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate and directly answered by the information in the passage."

This translates to: ""...due to cancer-related conditions I came to my country, received treatment for many years, and it was a relief. ... I received a ""green card"" from the stable position in the United States of America.""

Therefore, the passage clearly indicates the speaker's country is the United States of America.  The question asks which country the speaker received a visa from, and the passage directly links the green card (visa) to the USA.

"mema chedayata anuwa, maa ge maethivarana jayagrahanayata udaw kale kumana rata wenuwen penee siteemada?","The correct answer is **A: aemarika eksath janapadaya (United States of America)**.

* **The question asks:** Which country helped with the speaker's successful life?

Since the speaker permanently settled in America and received a green card, the United States is the country that facilitated their success.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: hong kong:** The speaker *left* Hong Kong.
* **C: eksath raajadhaaniya (United Kingdom):**  The passage doesn't mention the UK.
* **D: cheenaya (China):** While the speaker mentions a close relationship with mainland China, it's not the country that helped them achieve a stable life.

"mema chedaye sandahan wana paridi, kaerolin vilsan nagarayen pitaweemata pera waeda kale ka wenuwen da?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...OHA hi kaerolin vilsan thamange aarakshitha thaenpatu soraagena, nagarayen paena gos aethi bhava ya.""  This translates to ""...OHA has secured Carolin Vilsan's protected place, causing unrest in the city.""

This directly links the OHA to Carolin Vilsan being moved to the city. The question asks *why* Carolin Vilsan was brought to the city, and the text indicates it was due to the OHA's actions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: eest be prajaa neethi madyasthaanaya** - This is mentioned as a place where people are being relocated *from*, not the reason for Carolin Vilsan's move.
*   **B: okland polisiya** - The text mentions Oakland police are investigating housing issues, but doesn't connect them to Carolin Vilsan's specific move.
*   **D: lokwud ud‍yaanaya** -  Locwood Gardens is a place people have faith in for housing, but not directly linked to Carolin Vilsan's situation.

"mema tharaga waraye ithiriwa aethi tharaga hatharak samagin, dhaawana shurathaavaliye hatharawana sthaanaye sitinne kawuda?","The correct answer is **A: haemlin**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Thewana sthaanayata paemini haemlin lakunu vissak pitupasin sitina namuth boyarta vada pahak idiriyen sity."" This translates to ""Hemlin finished third, gaining positions, and was ahead of Boyar.""  This clearly indicates Hemlin finished higher than Boyar.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kahn:** The text states Kahn finished with a profit of 2,220k, but doesn't mention his placement relative to the top spots.
* **C: Stuwat:** The text mentions Stewart being in the top ten, but doesn’t say he gained positions.
* **D: Boyar:** The text explicitly states Hemlin finished *ahead* of Boyar.



"
"mema chedaye sandahan dhaawana tharagayen pasuwa, dhaawana shurathaavaliye kahn sathuwa lakunu keeyak thibeda?","The question asks for the profit earned by Khan in the race. The text states: ""khaan saha truveks juniyar piliwelin lakunu 2,220 k saha 2,207 k labaa pas wana saha hiya wana sthsanaye sititi."" which translates to ""Khan and Truex Jr. finished with profits of 2,220k and 2,207k respectively.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: 2220**."
"mema chedayata anuwa, pasukaleenawa angaharu sambhawayak aethi bawa thahawuru kala ulkaapaatha waetena aakaraya minisun kee wathawak daeka thibeda?","The passage states: ""Pruthuwiyata pathitha wee aethi dhala washayen 24,000kata aasanna hadunaagata ulkaapaatha pramaanaya atharin angaharu sambhavayak aethi eva bavata thahawuru wee aeththe 34 k pamani."" This translates to: ""The probability of future impacts of asteroids that fell to Earth is approximately 24,000, and the size of asteroids that have fallen to Earth is 34k.""

The question asks: ""According to this passage, how many asteroids are likely to fall in the future?""

The passage mentions ""atharin angaharu sambhavayak aethi eva"" (approximately 24,000).

Therefore, the answer is **D: this-hathara wathawak** (twenty-four thousand).



"
"mema chedaye sandahan wana paridi, angaharu sambhawayak aethi bawata soyagath paashana pilibanda wu sathyaya kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: ewa siyallama pahe juli masaye ulkapatha warshawa atharathura soya gannaa ladee.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""mema paashaanavalin pahalovak pasugiya juuli maasayedi sidu woo ulkaa varsaave laksana penvayi.""  This translates to ""Based on the study of these stones, it appears to be a sign of a meteor shower that occurred in July.""

The question asks what the passage says about the stones. Option A directly reflects this information - the stones suggest a meteor shower in July.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ewa 24,000k aetha** - While 24,000 is mentioned, it refers to the approximate number of past impacts, not what the stones *indicate*.
* **C: ewa rathran walata wadaa dolar 11,000k watee** -  This relates to the time frame the rare stones existed (11,000 - 22,500 years ago) and isn't what the stones themselves *reveal*.
* **D: ewa 34k aetha** - 34k is mentioned as the size of the impacts, not what the stones suggest.



"
shoomakar vishraama giye kawada da?,"The correct answer is **A: felipe maasa ge anathuren pasuwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""thuvala laebu felipe masa venuvata adesha kirimata niyamitha ya."" which translates to ""He was ordered to leave the Ferrari team due to Felipe Massa's injury.""  Therefore, Schumacher took a break *because of* Felipe Massa's accident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ohuge hathweni shurathaavaya dinaa gaeneemen pasuwa** -  This refers to Schumacher completing his contract, not the reason for his break.
*   **C: felipe masaa ge thaena gaeneemen pasuwa** - This says he came because of Massa's place, which isn't accurate - he came *because* Massa was injured.
*   **D: 2009 tharaga samaya awasanaye dee** - This refers to the end of the 2009 season, not the *reason* for his break.



"
masa thuwala laebuwe kawada da?,"The correct answer is **A: graend priks tharagawaliyak atharathura** (Grand Prix tarangaavaliya atharathura - Grand Prix race series).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""2009 varshaye hangeriyaanu graend pricks tarangaavaliya atharathura aethivu anaturin brasiliyaanuvaage hisata thadabala thuwaala aethiviya."" (In 2009, Felipe Massa was involved in an accident during the Hungarian Grand Prix race series.)

The question asks where Massa had the accident. The passage directly answers that it was during the Grand Prix race series.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, mema vidhividhaana e. o. el walata balapanu aeththe keseda?","The correct answer is **C: yahoo saha mayikrosoft bhaavitha karannange sankyawa e. o. el bhaavitha karannange sankyawa samaga tharaga wadinu aetha**.

Here's why:

The original passage states that the number of people using Yahoo and Microsoft services decreased, and this decrease *correlated* with the growth of e.o.l.  Option C directly reflects this relationship: ""the number of Yahoo and Microsoft users decreased *along with* the growth of e.o.l.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  While the passage mentions the number of e.o.l. users increasing, it doesn't state that this is the *only* thing happening.
* **B:** The passage mentions temporary benefits, but that's not the core relationship being explored in the question.
* **D:** The passage *implies* a connection between the decline of Yahoo/Microsoft and the rise of e.o.l., not that e.o.l. *caused* the decline or wasn't affected by the joint population.



"
nawa vidhividhaanayen pasuwa awasan viya haekke pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: eksath janapadaye pulul antharjala sanvardhanaya** (The expansion of the internet due to the rise of the unified nation).

Here's why:

The original text (P) discusses how a unified nation (eksath janapadaya) led to the development and growth (sanvardhanaya) of the internet (antharjala) and digital technology. The text highlights how this growth was initially driven by things like instant messaging and eventually led to the dominance of companies like Yahoo! and Microsoft.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: kshanika panivida welandapola bhaavithaya** (The feeling of instant messaging) - While mentioned, it's a *result* of the overall trend, not the overarching cause.
* **C: thamangema wegayakin welandapola sanvardhanaya kirimata e. o. el hata nidahasa** (The development of their own fast communication and the foundation of e.o.l) - This is a specific detail *within* the broader trend.
* **D: yahoo saha mayikrosoft hawulkarithwaya** (The dominance of Yahoo and Microsoft) - Again, these are *outcomes* of the bigger change, not the change itself.

The question asks what *caused* the change, and the most accurate answer based on the text is the expansion of the internet linked to the rise of the unified nation.



"
prahaarayen miya giya ayagen kee denek polis niladhaareen nowanneda?,"The question asks how many people the police identified as suspects after the attack. The text states: ""Thuwaala laebu ayagen dahanava deneku polis niladhaarin bhava aandukara kaaryalaya paewaseeya."" This translates to ""After the arrest of the suspects, the police began investigations at the police station.""  It then says ""Me prahaaraye wagakeema sambandhava daayish (isil) satankaamiyek saeka karana bhava polisiya pawasai."" which translates to ""Police are investigating whether this attack has links to a Daesh (ISIL) terrorist.""

However, the text **does not state the *number* of suspects identified**. It only mentions investigations started *after* arrests.  Therefore, we have to rely on the information provided in the beginning.

The first sentence says, ""...dee pupuraa giya motor rathha bombayakin dedeneku marumuvata pathwa thavat pudgalayin visi deneku thuwaala laebuha."" This translates to ""...the police arrested individuals suspected of being involved in the bomb attack in the three-wheeled vehicle.""  While it doesn't explicitly state the exact number, it implies there were **19** people arrested and investigated initially (as stated in the provided text). 

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: 19**.



"
mema prahaaraya sambandha saekakaru pilibandawawa waartha kale kawuda?,"The correct answer is **C: maadhya waarthakaruwan** (media reporters).

Here's why:

The passage states the police are investigating and suspect a connection to ISIS.  However, the question asks *who* reported the news about the attack.  The most logical answer is media reporters, as they are the ones who disseminate news to the public.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: polisiya (police):** The police are *investigating* the attack, they didn't *report* it initially.
* **B: aandukarawarayage kaaryaalaya (attacker's office):** This is nonsensical; attackers don't report their own attacks.
* **D: gaesiyantep pradeshawaseen (Gaziantep residents):** While residents would be aware of the attack, they aren't the primary source of the news report.



"
"mema janapadaye jayagraahakaya siyalu janapadawala jayagraahakaya wanu aetha yana floridaawe thaththwaya hethuwen, mit romnita pirinamana ladde kumak da?","The correct answer is **B: ripablikan pakshaye apekshakathwaya** (Republican party candidacy).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...eya ohu repablikan paksha apeksakayaa lesa idiri pelin thabaamin idiriyata gene giyeya."" This translates to ""...he entered the competition as a Republican candidate.""  The question asks what Romney gained from the Florida result. Winning in Florida significantly boosted his chances of becoming the Republican nominee.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: janapadaye niyojanayan 32 ma** (32 in the people's planning) - This refers to Gingrich's percentage, not Romney's gain.
*   **C: janapadaye niyojanayan siyallama** (all in people's planning) - Too broad and doesn't directly relate to Romney's benefit.
*   **D: chandawalin siyayata 46** (46 to support Romney) - This is just a statistic about support, not the outcome or gain.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, moolika maethivaranachayen gingrichta laebunu chanda prathishathaya kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: siyayata 32**.

The text states: ""Hitapu eksath janapada paarlimentuve kataanaayaka newut gingrich siyayata 32 ka pratisatayak dinaa ganimin devana sthaanayata path viya.""  This translates to ""Former Speaker of the United States Parliament Newt Gingrich received 32 percent of the votes.""

Therefore, the percentage of votes Gingrich received is 32.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, kokas hamuwe prathiphalayen pasuwa digata ma tharaga nokale kawuda?","The correct answer is **A: gingrich**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pratiphala paeminimen pasuwa, gingrich, saentoram hata prashansaa kalada..."" which translates to ""Responding to the endorsement, Gingrich received praise from the Santorum camp..."" This directly indicates Gingrich was the one who received an endorsement (prathiphalaya).

The question asks who *received* the endorsement and didn't run for office. The text details Gingrich getting an endorsement *and* then criticizing Romney.  Baechman, Peri, and Romney are all mentioned as potentially running or being involved in campaigns.



"
"mema chedaya anuwa, kokas hamuwe prathiphalayak lesa wenath apekshakayeku gaena ihalin katha kale kawuda?","The correct answer is **B: gingrich**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pratiphala paeminimen pasuwa, gingrich, saentoram hata prashansaa kalada..."" (Following the reward, Gingrich received praise from Santorum...). This clearly indicates Gingrich *received* a reward and is therefore the one being talked about as benefiting from it.

The question asks who benefited from the reward.  The text directly links the reward to Gingrich.



"
2015 ta pera pradarshanaya paewathi ekama sthaanaya koheda?,"The correct answer is **C: aest‍ronet rediyo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pasugiya 2015 vasare, toginet visin anubaddha sthaanayak washayen **aestronet rediyo sthaapana karana ladi**.""  (Following 2015, they started establishing **aestronet radio** connected to TogiNet.)

Therefore, the exhibition was held at aestronet radio starting in 2015.



"
mema madyasthaanaya pradarshanaya visthara karanne kumana aakaraye bhramanayak aethi lesada?,"The correct answer is **B: kalaanuroopa nowu** (contemporary novel).

Here's why:

The passage states the exhibition expands on the theme of """"nava ha saahasika kaalanurupa novoo bhugoliya bramanayen yuth paerani pasael guvanviduli rangahalak!"""" which translates to something like """"a new and adventurous contemporary novel geographical exploration using space/satellite technology!"".  

* **kaalanurupa nowu** directly translates to ""contemporary novel"". The whole phrase centers around a *new* and *contemporary* approach.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aadhunika** (modern) - While relevant, ""kaalanuroopa nowu"" is a more specific descriptor of the *type* of exploration being showcased.
* **C: paerani pasal** (space travel) - Space travel is a *tool* used in the exploration, not the *type* of exploration itself.
* **D: pradesheeya** (regional) -  The passage mentions Texas, but the exploration isn't limited to a region; it’s a broader, contemporary novel-based geographical exploration.



"
devid hedli awasanaye prahaaraka kandaayame prahaarayata aadhaara wana lesa raes kale kumak da?,"The correct answer is **C: thuwakkukaruwan** (meaning ""attackers"" or ""militants"").

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Devid hidlige purva sodhisi kireem saha **toraturu raeskireem** laskhar-e-thayiba paakistaanu bata kandaayamehi tuvakku bhatayan 10 ka kandaayamak magin meheyuma kriyaatmaka kirimata sahaya wee aetha.""  ""Toraturu raeskireem"" directly translates to militants/attackers who came from Pakistan with the help of Lashkar-e-Taiba.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: thorathuru:**  This is part of the description of the militants (""toraturu raeskireem"") but isn't the overall answer to *who* supported the attack.
* **B: athbomba:** This means ""bombs"" - while bombs were used, it's not *who* was behind the attack.
* **D: swayankriya avi:** This means ""suicide avi"" (likely referring to suicide attacks) - again, a method used, not the people responsible.



Therefore, the passage explicitly links David Headley's involvement to assisting **militants/attackers** who carried out the Mumbai attacks."
mumbai wetha yamata prahaaraka kandaayama bhaavitha kale kumana prawaahana kramayada?,"The correct answer is **C: bottuwa**.

Here's why:

The text (P) specifically states: ""2008 novaembar 26 **venida bottuven** paemini mumbai prahaarakayan..."" which translates to ""On November 26, 2008, a team of **boats** launched the Mumbai attacks...""

Therefore, the attackers arrived in Mumbai by boat.  The other options (dumriya - train, guvan yaanaya - airplane, kaar rathaya - car) are not mentioned in the text as the method of arrival.



"
mema chedaye sandahan paridi nadaal saha ronikge brisben viwurtha tharagaye prathiphalaya niwaeradiwa pilibimbu karanne kumana prakaashayada?,"The correct answer is **A: ronik nadaalwa paraajaya kaleya** (Ronik lost the match).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ohu naevatat maethaka dee brisben vivurta tarangavaliye dee raeyonik hata paraajaya viya.""  This directly translates to ""He lost to Ronik in the Brisbane open tournament.""
* The question asks about the result of the Brisbane tournament.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ronikta shuddha lakunu 88%k thibuni** (Ronik had a net profit of 88%): While the passage mentions a 88% profit, it's related to *nadal*, not *ronik*.
* **C: nadaal ronik paraajaya kaleya** (Nadal lost to Ronik): This is a correct interpretation of the sentence, but not the *question* is asking.
* **D: ronik lakunu 76k laba gaththeya** (Ronik gained a profit of 76k): The passage says *nadal* gained 76k, not ronik.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, palamu pirinaemeemen pasuwa nadaal saha ronikge tharagaye sthaawaraya kumak weeda?","The correct answer is **B: nadaal lakunu 76k laba gaththeya** (nadaal gained 76k profit).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Palamu pirinaemeeme dee lakunu 76k labaa ganimin nadal tharagaye 88%ka suddha lakunu labaa gatte ya.""  This directly translates to ""The first outcome gained a profit of 76k, and the nadaal gained a net profit of 88%.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ronikta shuddha lakunu 88%k thibuni** (ronik had a net profit of 88%) - While true, the question asks about *nadaal*, not *ronik*.
*   **C: lakunu thathwaya 7-2 viya** (the ratio of profit was 7-2) - This refers to a different piece of information (""Kaenediyaanuvanta erehiva nadalge karata kara vaarthaava 7-2 ki""), and isn't directly answering what nadaal gained.
*   **D: ronik nadaalwa paraajaya kaleya** (ronik and nadaal suffered defeat) - The passage states ronik suffered defeat, but not nadaal.



"
nawa nekad niwus vikaashana thunakata aethulath kara nomaethi bhaasha waedasatahana kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: spaangnga**.

Here's how we can break down the text to arrive at the answer:

* **The question asks:** Which language, besides Japanese, is mentioned as being used to spread news related to new development with unavoidable language barriers?
* **The text states:** ""Ingrisi saha japan bhaashaavangen me wana vitat vaartakaranaye niyuthu wana mema goleeya sanvidhaanaya **spaangna, itaali, saha koriyanu-bhaashaa vaedasatahan**, rupavaahiniyata, web adaviyata, saha jangama upangavalata diyath kirimata niyamithaya."" (This global constitution that employs news spread through English and Japanese languages is regulated to deliver through television, web, and mobile technologies with **Spanish, Italian, and Korean languages**.)

Therefore, Spanish (spaangnga) is one of the languages listed alongside Japanese for spreading news.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, nawa nekad niwus vikaashanaya laba gatha nohaeki wanne koheda?","The question asks where new development ( *nawa nekad niwus vikaashanaya*) that isn't possible to obtain elsewhere is found, based on the provided text (P).

Let's break down the relevant part of the text:

""...pravruthi vaartakaranaye anivaarya jaatyantara bhaashava thaman visin ganana aedahiya nohaeki lesa ihala damana bhava nekad nivus visin pasugiya sathiye daenum dene ladi...Ingrisi saha japan bhaashaavangen me wana vitat vaartakaranaye niyuthu wana mema goleeya sanvidhaanaya spaangna, itaali, saha koriyanu-bhaashaa vaedasatahan, **rupavaahiniyata, web adaviyata, saha jangama upangavalata diyath kirimata niyamithaya.**""

This translates roughly to: ""...due to the nature of information exchange, computations are made without any limitation for seeking novel solutions... This global constitution, utilized by English and Japanese, allows for dissemination of information via **broadcast media, the internet, and mobile devices.**""

The text specifically states that novel development (things not possible elsewhere) are *distributed through* mobile devices ( *jangama upangavalata* ).

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: jangama upaanga (mobile devices)**.



"
tharagakaruwan kee denek gayant slalom tharagaya awasan nokale da?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ehidi tharagakaruwan 117 denagen 45 ta ema pratipalayama ath viya."" which translates to ""Of the 117 competitors, 45 did not finish the giant slalom.""

Therefore, 45 competitors did not finish the giant slalom race.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...hangeriyave navavaeni sthaanayata patvu jiyaengi danita vadaa minuttu 1: 09.02 k mandagaamiva ya."" This translates to ""Hungary's Danita finished the race with a time of 1:09.02, slowly.""  This directly answers the question about who finished the race.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage mentions 45 athletes were *eligible* for the giant slalom, not that they finished it.
* **C:** The passage doesn't say any athletes *failed* to finish the giant slalom.
* **D:** The passage mentions the total race time (4:41.30) and the winning time, but not the time it took to complete a single slalom section.



"
en. bee. e. athhituweemata theeranaya kale pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: paesipandu samaya** (the investment period).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...eksath janapadaye jaathika paesipandu sangamaya (en.bee.e) badada dina, siya vurttiya paesipandu samaya athhitavuye ya.""  This translates to ""...the day the national investment conference (en.bee.e) was held, it was said that the investment period had been completed.""
* **The question asks:** What was completed on the day of the en.bee.e.?

Therefore, the answer is the *paesipandu samaya* - the investment period.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: yuta jaes kandaayame kreedakayek** (a player in a youth sports event) - Not mentioned in relation to the en.bee.e.
* **C: kovid-19 waelandee aethi bawa pareekshanawalin thahawuru wu onaema kreedakayek** (a player who tested positive for COVID-19) - This is mentioned, but not related to *when* the en.bee.e. took place.
* **D: yuta jaes paesipandu kandaayama** (youth sports investment) -  Doesn't directly answer the question about what was completed on the day of the conference.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, vairasaya sambandhayen en. bee. e. hi kanassallata hethu wuye kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: en. bee. e. saamaajikayekuta vairasaya waelandee aethi bawa thahawuru weema** (The NBE increased the day the national passenger transport service was suspended due to COVID-19, signifying a time when economic activity was halted because the virus was spreading within society).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...eksath janapadaye jaathika paesipandu sangamaya (en.bee.e) badada dina, siya vurttiya paesipandu samaya athhitavuye ya."" (The day the national passenger transport service (NBE) was suspended, economic activity came to a halt.) and ""...utaah jaes waadakayeku kovid-19 vairasaya waeladhee aethi bavata pariksanavalin thahavuru viya."" (Many athletes tested positive due to the spread of the COVID-19 virus).
* **The question asks:** What was the reason for the NBE's increase related to the virus?
* **Option A** directly links the NBE increase to the virus spreading *within society* and the resulting economic halt, which aligns with the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** Focuses *only* on athletes, while the passage shows it's a broader societal impact.
* **C:**  Mentions athletes playing despite illness, which isn't the *reason* for the NBE increase, just a consequence of the situation.
* **D:** Again, focuses solely on athletes, neglecting the broader economic and societal context.

aetlanta thraeshars samaga paewathi tharagayedee voshingtan kaepital wenuwen jayagraahee golaya waartha kale kawuda?,"The correct answer is **D: aeleks owechkin**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Aetlanta thraeshars paradavaa voshingtanaya lath 5-3 jayagrahanayedi ohu gol 2 k dinaagat atharama gol sandaha 2 varakma sahaaya daekvuveya Tharagaya jayagrahanaya kireema sandaha aadhunika kridaka nikalas baekstroam ella kala golayata daekvu sahaya, **edina raathriyedi ovechkinge prathama sahaya vuyeya**.

This translates to: ""...Atlanta Thrashers defeated Washington 5-3, he scored 2 goals, had 2 assists...Niklas Backstrom assisted on all the goals, **but on this night it was Ovechkin's first assist**. That night he scored a goal...""

The question asks who scored the game-winning goal against the Atlanta Thrashers. The text implies Ovechkin scored *a* goal, and importantly, the paragraph focuses on Ovechkin achieving a milestone (potentially 60 goals), making him the central figure of the victory. While Backstrom assisted, Ovechkin's contribution is highlighted as significant.



"
kaepitals saha thraeshars athara paewathi tharagayedee mema waarayedee thama 60 waeni golaya warthaa kale kawuda?,"The correct answer is **C: aeleks owechkin**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Ovechkin scored his 60th goal of the season, joining Jerome Iginla and Mario Lemieux in a select group of players who have achieved this feat. The question asks who reached their 60th goal in this particular game/story. Therefore, the answer is Ovechkin.



"

Here's why:

The text states: ""2007 vasare upaprathama ukas arbudaya atharathura kalayedi ehi niraavaranaya hetuven nothern rok wetha sahaya awashya kara tibini.""  This directly translates to: ""In 2007, due to the financial crisis, Northern Rock needed state aid.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: baenkuwa jaathikakaranaya kala pasu** (during the nationalization of the bank) - While nationalization happened *after* the need for aid, the aid was needed *because* of the crisis, not the nationalization itself.
*   **B: wathkam kalamanaakarana samaagamen baenkuwa wen wu vita** (when the bank went into administration) - This is a consequence of the problems, not the initial reason for needing help.
*   **C: varjin samoohaya baenkuwa mila dee gath pasuwa** (due to the Virgin group's attempt to merge with the bank) - The Virgin Group's offer came *after* the bank was already in trouble.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, varjin samoohaya saha nodarn rok baenkuwa athara ganudenuwa niwaeradiwa visthara karanne pahatha sandahan prakaashawalin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: varjin samoohaya nodarn rok hi wathkam kalamanaakarana samaagama da mila dee gaththeya** (The rejection group met with Northern Rock regarding loan modifications).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Varjin miladi gena aeththe nothern rok hi 'yahapat baenkuva' pamanak wana athara vatkam kalamanaakarana samagama nove.""  This translates to: ""Because of the rejection, a meeting with Northern Rock to achieve 'suitable bank' status (regarding loan modifications) did not occur.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage mentions the rejection *prevented* the nationalization, not that it happened *after* nationalization.
* **C:** The passage discusses a request for help due to the mortgage crisis, not that the rejection group *received* help.
* **D:**  While the passage details Richard Braens' group rejecting the bank, it doesn't say the meeting was to *initiate* the bank's nationalization. It relates to loan modifications.

"mema chedaye sandahan paridi, kiyoto deshagunika givisuma athsan kirimen balapaemata lak wanne kumana ratatada?","The correct answer is **A: eksath janapadaya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kiyoto desagunika givisuma athsan kirimata radd mahatha gath **tiranaya eksath janapadaya** hudakala wee daen givisuma anumatha nokarana ekama sanvardhitha rata vanu aetha.""  This directly translates to ""...kiyoto's unfavorable climate caused problems for the many **United States** that were unable to accept the increased rate of decline.""

Therefore, the passage identifies the United States (eksath janapadaya) as the country facing problems due to the climate.



"
kiyoto anumatha kirimen kumak sandaha haaniyak siduwanu aethaeyi kalin paewathi ostreliyanu rajaya vishwaasa kaleda?,"The correct answer is **B: rate aarthikaya** (the country's economy).

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""...visvaasaya thaebima magin **aarthikayata haani siduviya haeki** yaeyi pavasamin oustreliyave kalin paewathi konservetive rajaya kiyoto sthira kireema pratiksepa kale ya.""  This translates to ""...the conservative government of Australia, believing it would cause **damage to the economy**, rejected the Kyoto protocol...""

The question (Q) asks what damage the Australian government *believed* Kyoto would cause. The passage directly answers this with ""damage to the economy.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: eksath janapadaya** (united nations) - While the Kyoto protocol involved international cooperation, the passage specifically attributes the Australian government's rejection to economic concerns, not a problem with the UN.
*   **C: gal aguru apanayana** (emission reduction) - Emission reduction is *the goal* of Kyoto, not the damage the government feared.
*   **D: rate vimochana ilakka** (national liberation targets) - This isn't mentioned as a concern in the passage.



"
pareekshanaye vedikkaruvan bandawa gaththe kumana waedasatahana sandahada?,"The correct answer is **D: kreedaa wedikkaru sangamaye dadayam waedasatahana** (the dadayam of the sports federation).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Npws saha oustreliyave kreeda vedikkaru sangamaya (nsw) samaga ekva, kreeda vedikkaru sangamaye **dadayam vaedasatahanata** sudusukam lath svechcha sevakayin bandavaaganna ladi.""  This directly translates to ""NPWS together with the NSW Sports Federation, recruited volunteers to easily fulfill the **dadayam (responsibilities)** of the sports federation.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ost‍reliyawe kreedaa vedikkaru sangama waedasatahana** - While the federation is mentioned, the *dadayam* (responsibilities) are what the volunteers were recruited for.
*   **B: ud‍yaana sanrakshanaya saha urumaya waedasatahana** - This refers to the responsibilities of a different person (Maik Offlin) regarding park conservation and heritage.
*   **C: en pee dabliw es waedasatahana** - This isn't mentioned in the text.



"
palibodha mardana pareekshanaya niwaeradiwa pilibimbu nokaranne kumana prakaashaya da?,"The correct answer is **B: vedikkaruvanta puhunu upades laebuni** (provides new advice to the referees).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""palamu vedi thaebime meheyumata thoraagat vedikkaruvan sivdenata aarakshava pilibanda pulul puhunu upades labaa duni.""  This translates to ""The first video and these materials provide new advice regarding protecting the referees.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eya waedasatahane palamu pareekshanaya baevin kisidu aegayeemak sidu noweeya** (it is not a first trial to improve the referees) - The passage doesn't focus on whether it's a first attempt.
* **C: vedikkaruvan renjarvarun visin adheekshanaya karana ladee** (involved in supervising the referees) - This is mentioned, but isn't the *purpose* of the materials.
* **D: vedikkaruvan siwdeneku thoraa gannaa ladee** (involved in disturbing the referees) - The passage is about *protecting* referees, not disturbing them.



Therefore, option B accurately reflects the information provided in the text."
"mema chedayata anuwa, mema bedee yama soya gaththe kohenda?","The correct answer is **D: ithiyopiyawe**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly states:** ""...ithiyopiyaave nimna vivara paryeshana sevaave paryeshakayeku saha adyayanaye samakrutha..."" ( ""...a researcher and study conducted by the Ethiopian Lower Paleontological Research Service..."").
* **The question (Q) asks:** ""According to this text, what does this bedding refer to?""  The text clearly links the ""bedding"" (presumably referring to fossil layers) to Ethiopia.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: rift nimnaye (rift valley):**  While Ethiopia *contains* the Rift Valley, the passage doesn't specifically state the bedding is *in* the Rift Valley, just that the research is Ethiopian.
* **B: fosilayak matha (fossil head):** The passage mentions a fossil head, but doesn't say the bedding *is* the fossil head.
* **C: anukamaya saakshi wala (witness evidence):** This is a descriptive element within the passage but not what the bedding *is*.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, balaaporoththu wuwaata wadaa ikmanin sidu wuye kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: anukamaya saakshi vishleshanaya** (analysis of genetic evidence).

Here's why:

* **P** discusses fossil evidence (""mema fosilaya""), but also mentions ""anukamaya saakshya"" (genetic evidence) being crucial in understanding the origins of humanity, potentially even surpassing fossil records.  The passage suggests genetic evidence is helping to redraw the timeline of human evolution.
* **Q** asks what the passage focuses on *in addition to* fossils.
* **A** (fossil soyaa gaeneema - fossil soybean?) is irrelevant.
* **B** (bedee yaema - ancient era?) is too broad and doesn't represent the specific addition to fossil evidence mentioned in P.
* **D** (rift nimnaye paryeshana - research in the rift valley) is a *location* of research, but not the *type* of evidence being discussed as supplementary to fossils.

Therefore, the passage clearly highlights the importance of **genetic evidence analysis** alongside fossil discoveries, making **C** the correct answer.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Memagin kridakayinta upangaya avakaashaya thula chalanaya karamin vidiyo kridaavala kriyaa saha chalana paalanaya kirimata ida saelasei.""  This translates to ""This technology allows video game actions and movements to be controlled by the player's physical movements.""  The passage then details how the controller *senses* those movements.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: aewaaye pihiteema thrimana gatha kirima** (moving within the displayed three dimensions) - This describes *what* happens in the game, not *how* the player controls it.
* **C: owunge rupavaahiniya asala sanwaedaka thaebeema** (sensitive touch on their screen) - The passage focuses on movement, not touch.
* **D: paalakayaa awakaashaya thula chalanaya kirima** (moving the controller) - While true, this doesn't explain *how* the game understands the movement, which is the core of the question.



"
rupavahini durasthayak lesa penena paridi nirmanaya kara aeththe kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: paalakayaagae sanvedaka deka** (the controller's sensitive screen).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Rupavaahini durastha paalakayaka aaakaraye mema paalakaya, parisilakayaage rupavaahiniye pihitima thrimana avakaasayakata haeravimata e asala thaebu sanvedaka dekak bhavitha karayi.""  This translates to: ""This controller, acting as a distant television controller, has a sensitive screen that allows for 3D space interaction on the television screen.""

Therefore, the television controller uses a sensitive screen to create the 3D interaction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: nintendo revolushan paalakaya** (Nintendo Revolution controller) - While it *is* the controller, the question asks what *creates* the 3D effect.
* **C: pradhaana idiripath kireema** (chief director) - This refers to Satoru Iwata, a person, not a component.
* **D: nintendo revolushan konsolaya** (Nintendo Revolution console) - The console is the system, but the screen is *part of* the controller that enables the 3D effect.



"
sinhuvaa prawurththi ejansiyae nawathama waarthawae sandahan nowannae kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: guvan yaanayata bomba tharjanayak aethi viya** (a government vehicle was targeted by a bomb).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Pasukaaleena vaarthaa inpasuva sandahan kale guvan yaanayata bomba tarjanayak aethi woo bawath inpasu aefghanisthaanaya wetha haravaa gos kandahaar wetha godabaana lada bavayi.""  This directly translates to: ""Recent news reports that a bomb attack targeted a government vehicle in Afghanistan, specifically in Kandahar.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: guvan yaanaya urmki hi goda baesseya** (the government vehicle was damaged by a landmine) - The passage mentions a *bomb* attack, not a landmine.
* **C: guvan yaanaya aefganisthaanayata harawaa yaevini** (the government vehicle was moving towards Afghanistan) -  The passage says the incident *happened in* Afghanistan, not that it was traveling *to* Afghanistan.
* **D: guvan yaanaya kandahaar hi goda baesseya** (the government vehicle was damaged in Kandahar) - While the attack happened *in* Kandahar, the passage emphasizes the *bomb attack* as the key event, not just the location.



Therefore, option A accurately reflects the information presented in the passage regarding what the news agency reported."
sinhuvaa prawurththi ejansiye mulma waarthawe sandahan nowunae kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: guvan yaanaya paehaeragena aetha** (they went looking for the military vehicle).

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Mita pera china pravuruthi ejansiyak wana sinhuvaa vaarthaa kale guvan yaanayak paehaeragena yaamata niyamitha bavayi."" This translates to: ""A limited number of personnel from the special forces were dispatched looking for a military vehicle after receiving information from a Chinese intelligence agency.""
* **Q asks:** What did the intelligence agency do with the information?
* **Option A** directly answers this, stating they *went looking for the military vehicle*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: guvan yaanaye hadisi godabaemak prathikshepa karana ladee** (the team that rejects the military vehicle's details) - The text doesn't mention a team rejecting details.
* **C: guvan yaanaya naewatha aefghanisthaanayata harawaa yawana ladi** (the team that went to Afghanistan without the military vehicle) - While they *ended up* in Afghanistan, the initial action was to *look for* the vehicle.
* **D: guvan yaanayata bomba tharjanayak aethi viya** (a bomb exploded on the military vehicle) - This is a later event described in the text, not what the agency did with the initial information.



"
guvanviduli waedasatahana atharathura saaraa daeniyas visin niwedanaya karana ladde kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: saahithyaya pilibanda nobel thyaaga jayagraahakayaa** (the Nobel laureate in literature).

Here's why:

The passage states the announcement came from the Swedish Academy, which is known for awarding the Nobel Prize in Literature. The passage also refers to efforts made ""after a lengthy and arduous process"" to reach the laureate, implying they were announcing the winner.  Therefore, the announcement concerns the recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: kamituvata sahakaruwangen prathichaarayak nolaebuni** (not receiving replies from committee collaborators):  While the passage *mentions* difficulty contacting the laureate, the main focus of the announcement isn't about communication problems with the committee.
* **C: 2016 sahithyaya pilibanda nobel thyaagayata nirdesha wu nam** (if someone was nominated for the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature):  The passage announces the *winner*, not a nominee.
* **D: bob dilan samaga sambandha weemata darana uthsahaya kamituva visin nawathwanu aetha** (they couldn't find the committee member who had a relationship with Bob Dylan): This is a specific detail *within* the larger announcement, but not the main subject of the announcement itself.



"
sambandha kara gaeneemata nohaeki wuye kaawada?,"The correct answer is **D: bob dilan**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""bob delan samaga rujuva sambandha weeme haekiyaavak nomaeti bawath"" which translates to ""it is said that there is a close relationship with bob dylan"". The question asks *who* the relationship is with.  The other options are places or people mentioned *in relation* to the Nobel Prize, but Bob Dylan is the person directly connected to the relationship being discussed.



"
pradhaana piyavarak lesa poronduwa pilibanda adahas daekwuye kawuda?,"The correct answer is **C: gordan jond‍row**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bushge maadhya pracaraka gordan jondrow, koreawe poronduva sambandhava pawasuwe eya """"koreanu ardhadvipaya thula sanatha kala haeki lesa nyashtika aviharanaya kireema sandaha gath pradhaana piyavarak"""" bavayi.""

This translates to: ""Bush's media spokesperson Gordon Jonrow, regarding the Korean promise, called it """"the main perpetrator of destructive behavior that threatens lasting peace on the Korean peninsula.""""

Therefore, Gordon Jonrow is the one who made the statement *about* the promise being a ""pradhaana piyavarak"" (main perpetrator).



"
slaniya vividha ratawal sandahaa muddara keeyak nishpaadanaya kalaada?,"The correct answer is **A: 2000 ta adhika (more than 2000)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...devid klokar erenstralge anagibhawaneeya woo 2000 """"svidan rajunge maha kriyaavan"""" ya.""  This translates to ""...David Crocker Ernsthal's unimaginable work, 2000 """"great operation of pledges"""""".  

Therefore, more than 2000 pledges were produced.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, taenkiye wa thaw walin digin digatama kaandu weemata hethuwa viya haekke kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: thaapa prasaaranaya (heat propagation)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Badaadaa pasvaruva wana vitat, taenkiye vaa thavvalin kaandu vim paewathiye, taenkiya abyantaraye thaapaya prasaaranaya weema nisaa viya yutuya.""  This translates to: ""Due to the expanding heat, the tanks, or even the walls, could be damaged, and heat propagation within the tank could occur.""  This directly links the digging/damage to heat propagation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: dvitheeyika bahalum kotasa dhaarithaawaya piree thibeema (holding the second large reservoir)** - While mentioned, this isn't the *reason* for the digging.
*   **B: gini vidhaana paddhathiyae saamaan‍ya pareekshanayak (routine inspection of the fire suppression system)** - The passage mentions fire suppression system checks, but not as the cause of the digging.
*   **D: fort greely pompaagaarawala ginnak (fire at Fort Greely pump house)** - The pump house is mentioned, but again, not as the direct cause of the digging.



"
mudahaereem kapaata vivurtha wuye aeyi?,"The correct answer is **A: taenki abyantharaye thaapa prasaaranayakviya** (the spreading of oil inside the tank).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...mudhaahaereem kapaata vivurta wee borathel pitaara gaeli ya. Vaelva vivurta kirimat samaga paddhithayata pidanayak nidahas weemata ida haerimen baerala 55,000ka...Badaadaa pasvaruva wana vitat, taenkiye vaa thavvalin kaandu vim paewathiye, taenkiya abyantaraye thaapaya prasaaranaya weema nisaa viya yutuya.""

This translates to: ""...the mudhaereem valve opened and oil spilled. As the valve opened with the system under pressure, it was found that 55,000ka (2.3 million gallons) was released into the tank...After a period of observation, it was determined that oil was spreading inside the tank...""

Therefore, the opening of the mudhaereem valve directly *caused* the spreading of oil within the tank.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: paddhathi pareekshanayakin pasuwa viduliya binda waeteemak siduviya** (electricity was cut off during the system test) - While electricity is mentioned, it's not directly linked to the valve opening.
*   **C: taenki sampoorna dharithavayen yuktha viya** (the tank was fully equipped with containment) - The passage describes a *release* of oil, indicating containment *failed* to some extent, not that it was fully equipped.
*   **D: dvithiyika bahalum kotasata pramaanawath tharam baeral randawaa gatha nohaeki viya** (the second containment level was not reached according to standards) - This is mentioned later in the passage as a preventative measure, not as a direct result of the valve opening.



"
"daenata, nawawana kottaashaye jala mattama kotharam ihalata pawatheeda?","The correct answer is **A: adi 20**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kaethrina suli kunatuva atharathuradi, adi **20 k** tharam ihala ganvaturak aethi...""  This translates to ""...and it's a height of **20** stories...""  The question asks about the height of the new kottaashaya (reservoir/tank).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: angal 6** - Refers to 6 years.
*   **C: ina dakva ihalata** - This means ""to the highest point seen"", it's descriptive, not a numerical height.
*   **D: adi 100k** - Refers to 100,000 palalata (units of water), not height.



"
kaethrina suli kunatuva atharathura nawawana kottaasha kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: ganvatura jala mattama adi 100 k palalata viya** (the water level in the high ground is 100k palalata).

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What is the water level in Kaetrina Suli Kunatuwa Atharathura?""
* **The passage states:** ""Vella mathin kotase adi 100k palalata jalaya baesa yayi."" (In the bottom of the well, the water level is 100k palalata.)  This refers to the water level at Kaetrina Suli Kunatuwa Atharathura.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** This describes the general flow of water, not the level *in* Kaetrina Suli Kunatuwa Atharathura.
* **C:**  The passage states 20k is the height of a *hill* (ihala ganvaturak), not the water level.
* **D:** This refers to the initial description of the engineer's work and doesn't answer the question about the water level.



"
haemiltan visin thahavuru nokarana ladde pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: wenath rogiyekuta vairasaya aasadanaya viya haeki sambhaavithawa** (the possibility of a virus spreading to another patient).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ibolaa vairasaya vaarthaa wee aethi naijiriyaavata, rogiya gos atha."" (There is news of the Ebola virus spreading from Nigeria, and there are sick patients.) and ""Aasaadanaya paalanaya kireema sandaha rohala visin rogiyaa an ayagen ven kireema aetuluva an ayata viya haeki aaaadanayan vaelaekvima aadee niti samudhaayan anugamanaya kara aetha."" (Following proper protocols is important to prevent the spread to other patients.)

* **The question asks:** why Hamilton needs to take action.  The passage clearly highlights the *risk of spreading the virus* as the primary reason.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: rogiya gaman kala thaena** (where the patient traveled) - This is background information, but doesn’t explain *why* action needs to be taken.
* **C: nisi neethi samudayan anugamanaya kara thibeda yanna** (not following ethical guidelines) - While important, this isn’t the immediate reason for Hamilton's actions, the spread of a dangerous virus is.
* **D: rogiyage wathman thathwaya** (the patient’s physical condition) -  While knowing the patient's condition is important for treatment, it doesn't explain the need for broader preventative measures.



"
vid‍yaagnayanta soya gaeneemata awashya wu de kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: kaabanika d‍ravya yanu kumakda** (What are the organic materials?).

Here's why:

* **P** states that comets brought organic materials that were beneficial to the emergence of life on Earth.  The text specifically mentions ""kaabanika drawya"" (organic materials).
* **Q** asks what scientists believe they gained. The most direct gain mentioned in **P** is the organic materials brought by comets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: dhoomakethu pruthuwiya samaga ghattanaya wuye kawadada** (What happened when the comet collided with Earth?) - While the text implies collisions, it doesn't focus on *what* happened during those collisions, but on *what they brought*.
* **B: proteena saedenne keseda** (What is protein?) - The text mentions protein *benefiting* life, but doesn't ask about what protein *is*.
* **D: pruthuwiya saedune keseda** (What is the Earth made of?) - The text doesn't focus on the composition of the Earth itself, but on additions *to* the Earth.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...fbi balapaema hamuve merilaend pravaahana adhikaariya visin eya wasaa damana ladi."" This directly translates to ""Despite requests from the FBI and Maryland transportation officials, they couldn't get suppression.""
* **The question asks:** What was the regional police's task in this operation?
* **Option A** directly addresses the lack of FBI assistance, which is a key detail mentioned in the passage relating to the operation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: owun wasaa daemeemata theeranaya kalaha** (They resolved the problem of suppression) - The passage indicates they *couldn't* get suppression, not that they resolved it.
* **C: owun riyaduran wenath maarga walata yomu kalaha** (They directed traffic to alternate routes) - While alternate routes are mentioned, directing traffic isn't the core task discussed in relation to the police.
* **D: owun vikalpa maargaye rathawaahana pramadayan waartha kalaha** (They reported accidents on alternate routes) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
wasaa daemeemedee uman maarga pivisumata sidu wuye kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: ewa vikalpa maarga lesa bhaavitha karana ladee** (it was diverted via alternative routes).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Apadrawya parivahana trak ratha umage pivisuma avahira kireema sandaha yodaagat athara motor ratha vikalpa maarga wetha yomu kireema sandaha polisiye 80 denekuge sahaya labaagaenuni."" This translates to: ""Due to suspicion of transporting contraband in trucks and other vehicles, police diverted traffic via alternative routes with the assistance of 80 officers.""
* **The question asks:** What happened to the traffic entering the area?
* **Option B** directly reflects the information in the passage - traffic was *diverted via alternative routes*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ewa awahira kerini** (it was stopped) - While there was suspicion, the passage explicitly states diversion, not stopping.
* **C: ewa riyaduran hata viwurtha viya** (it was released quickly) - This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: ehi thadabala waahana thadabadayak aethiviya** (there was obstruction of vehicles here) - While diversion *caused* obstruction, the passage focuses on the diversion itself, not the resulting obstruction.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""chaayaarupakaru shilpiyaa sepulvedaa bullwaard hi anek paeththe thama waahanaya navatvaa, paara tharanaya kirimata pera polis naewathumae chaayarupa gaenimata uthsaaha kala athara, eya akhandava karagaena yamin rathha waahana navatvamin city califoniaa mahaa maarga polis niladhaariyata devarakma ohuta naewatha yana lesa paewasimata polambavanu laeba aetha.""  This translates to the cinematographer being involved with highway patrol investigating reckless driving and accidents.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: chayaroopa shilpiya thama waahanaya sepulwedaa boliward asala nawatha thaebeeya** (The cinematographer didn't drive his vehicle on Sepulveda Boulevard) - While mentioned, this isn't the *reason* for his involvement.
* **C: chayaroopa shilpiya polis naewatheeme pinthura gaththeya** (The cinematographer painted what the police didn't see) - This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: chayaroopa shilpiyata bibarge pinthurayak laba gaeneemata haeki viya** (The cinematographer could get a painting in the department) -  This is unrelated to the context.



"
waahanaye haepeemata pera chayaroopa shilpiya kirimata uthsaha kale kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: polis naewatheemaka chayaroopa gaeneema**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...paara tharanaya kirimata pera polis naewathumae chaayarupa gaenimata uthsaaha kala athara..."" This translates to ""...after speeding and crossing lanes, he was enthusiastic about filming the scene with the police not present..."" 

This directly answers the question of what the filmmaker was enthusiastic about *after* the incident with the vehicle – filming with the police not present.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sepulwedaa boliward idiriye waahanaya naewathweema** - This refers to where he was driving, not what he was enthusiastic about.
*   **C: karyabahula adhiwegee paara tharanaya kirima** - This describes the actions (speeding and lane changes), not his enthusiasm.
*   **D: polis niladhaariyekuta thaman chayaroopa gaeneema digatama karagena yamata ida dena lesa eththu gaenweema** - This is a complex restatement of the overall situation, but doesn’t pinpoint the specific thing he was enthusiastic *about*.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Janaadhipathivarayaage thathwaya sthavara vuva da, ohuva dina kihipayak nivase hudekalaava thabaanu aetha."" This translates to ""As for the element of the lord of people, it is stationary, and he lives for many days in a fixed place.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ohuta saneepa naetha (there is no proximity to him):** The passage doesn't focus on distance or lack thereof.
* **B: ohuta ugure amaruwak aetha (there is bitterness for him):** While the passage mentions ""ugurae amaruva"" (bitterness), it's in a conditional clause about *if* someone tries to harm him, not as a defining characteristic of his state.
* **D: ohuta una rogaya aetha (he has a warm disease):** The passage mentions ""mrudu roga thathvayak"" (a mild disease element) but doesn't state he *has* it, only that it was used against him.



Therefore, the passage directly describes the lord of people's element as being stationary and fixed in place."
"mema chedayata anuwa, janaadhipathiwaraya pilibanda pahatha sandahan prakaashayangen sathya prakaashaya wanne kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: ohu sathi kihipayak niwase raendee sitinu aetha** (He is said to live in a small house with his family).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ohuva dina kihipayak nivase hudekalaava thabaanu aetha."" This directly translates to ""He is said to live in a small house with his family.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ohuta unak naetha** (He has no worries) - The passage doesn't mention anything about him having no worries.
* **C: viduli sandesha kirimata tharam ohu honda sawukya thathwayen pasu we** (He passes the electrical message happily) - This refers to his work, not his personal life.
* **D: ohuta daruni vairas thathwayak aetha** (He has a terrible enemy) - The passage begins mentioning an enemy (""vairasaya""), but doesn't confirm he *has* one, only that something happened relating to one.



Therefore, option **B** is the only statement directly supported by the text regarding the president's living situation."
"mema chedayata anuwa, gonu niwarthana suli kunaatuva digata ma durwala wanu aethaeyi apekshaa karanne kawadada?","The correct answer is **A: maaladiwayinata langaa weemata pera** (meaning: compared to the Maldives).

Here's why:

* **The question (Q) asks what the speaker expects to be less difficult.**  The original text (P) states the current situation is travelling 240 kilometers (or 149 miles) by air. It then *compares* this to the difficulty of travelling 83 kilometers by sea.
* The speaker implies travelling by sea is more difficult (""durvala viya haeki""). They are asking what makes it less difficult, and the only logical comparison point is the *alternative* they just mentioned – the Maldives.  The context strongly suggests they are comparing the difficulty of sea travel to air travel *to the Maldives*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: sulan wegaya paeyata kilomeetara 83 dakwa pahatha waetunu vita** - This simply restates part of the information. It doesn't address *why* something might be less difficult.
* **C: ehi uchchathama awasthaawata langaa weemata pera** -  ""Compared to this highest state"" is too vague and doesn't relate to the specific comparison being made.
* **D: sulan wegaya paeyata saethapum 149 dakwa langaa weemata pera** - Similar to B, this restates information but doesn't address the question of difficulty.



Therefore, **A** is the most logical answer based on the context of the text."
gonu niwarthana suli kunaatuve uchchathama awasthaawe sulan wegaya kotharam wuyeda?,"The question asks for the maximum speed during deceleration. The passage states:

""Ehi uchchatama avasthaave dee gonu, enam maaladivayin bhaashaaven tall cola malla namin haedinvena suli kunaatuve vegaya paeyata kilometar 240 ka (paeyata saethapum 149) bavata pathviya.""

This translates to: ""At its highest state, the car, in Maldives language, rapidly decelerated with a speed of 240 km/h (or 149 miles/h).""

Therefore, the maximum speed during deceleration is 240 kilometers per hour.

The correct answer is **B: paeyata saethapum 240**. (paeyata saethapum means ""miles per hour""). Even though the passage provides both km/h and mph, the question is about the *maximum* speed, and 240 is the higher value.



"
kaereniya breevis wala lakshanayak lesa nosaelakenne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: eya aelgee wargayaki (it belongs to the algae family)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""kaereniyaa brevis saamaanya pramaanayata vadaa sankendrana weema y. mema aelgee pramaanaya..."" ( *Kaerenia brevis* is found in high concentrations... this algae concentration...) This directly identifies *Kaerenia brevis* as an algae.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: eyata minisunge snaayu akreeya kala haekiya (it paralyzes the nerves of humans):** While the passage *mentions* it produces neurotoxins that can paralyze, this is a *result* of being an algae, not its defining characteristic in this context.
* **C: eya bahu saileeya we (it is very marine):** The passage implies it's a marine organism, but ""very marine"" isn't the key identification.
* **D: meya swabhavikawa sidu we (this is a natural occurrence):** The passage describes the phenomenon as natural, but it doesn't define *what* *Kaerenia brevis* *is*.



"
kaereniya breevis hata kala nohaekke pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **D: snaayu visha weemak nipadaweema** (producing neurotoxins that paralyze fish).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Aelgi, minisungae maenma mathsyayange snaayu akriya karana neyurotoxinayak nipadawai.""  This translates to ""This algae produces neurotoxins that paralyze fish.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: maths‍yayinge snaayu akreeya kirima** (paralyzing fish) - This is the *effect* of the algae, not what it *does*.
*   **B: onaema thathwayak yatathe wegayen wardhanaya weema** (growing through the absorption of nutrients) - The passage doesn't mention how the algae grows, just its effects.
*   **C: jalayata balapaem kirima** (strengthening the water) - The passage describes a foul odor, not strengthening.

"mema chedayata anuwa, felisiya suli kunaatuva hethuwen sidu nowuye pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: prayojanawath warshapathanaya**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ovaahu waetha aeda haelunu angal 6.34 k dakvaa wana varshaapathanaya, """"prayojanavath"""" yaeyi visthara kaeruni.""  This directly translates to ""The rainfall received here was 6.34k inches, explained as """"beneficial/useful"""".""
* **The question asks:** What was cited as the reason for Felicia's relief?
* **The passage links Felicia's relief (suli kunaatuvakva thibu felisiyaa) to the beneficial rainfall (prayojanawath warshapathanaya).**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: gigurum sahitha warshapathanaya (rainfall with thunder):** While the passage mentions gigurum (thunder), it doesn't connect it directly to Felicia's relief.
* **C: niranthara akunu (continuous clouds):** The passage mentions continuous clouds, but doesn't say that's *why* Felicia felt relief.
* **D: ganwathurin weedi yataweema (villagers' discussion):** The passage mentions villagers' talk, but doesn't link it to Felicia's relief.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""safir-simsan parimaanayae 4 wana mattamae suli kunaatuvakva thibu felisiyaa, nivarthana avapidana thathwayak dakva durvala viya."" This translates to ""Felicia was seen digging in 4 wells, and it was difficult to identify her as a result of the return/repayment method.""  This directly indicates Felicia was digging in wells and being categorized *as a result of* a return/repayment method.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ehi prathiphalayak wu warshapathanaya owahu hata prayojanawath viya** -  This talks about the rainfall being useful, but doesn't directly relate to Felicia's digging.
* **C: boho doopath wala warshapathanaya daknata laebeeya** - This speaks about seeing rainfall from a distance, again irrelevant to Felicia.
* **D: samahara waesi akunu samaga viya** - This mentions gathering with clouds, not related to Felicia's actions.



Therefore, option **B** is the most accurate interpretation of what the passage reveals about Felicia's digging."

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pikae juniyar 2009 hangaeriyaanu gron pri tharangayaen pasu ivath karana ladhi"" which translates to ""Piquet Junior was able to compete in the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: farnaendo alonso anathurakata lak viya** (Fernando Alonso was unlucky) - While the text mentions Alonso, it doesn't say he was unlucky in the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.
* **B: piket juniyar jayagrahanaya kaleya** (Piquet Junior won) - The text doesn't say Piquet Junior won the race.
* **D: aarakshaka rathaya anathurakata lak viya** (The safety car was unlucky) - The text mentions a safety car, but not its luck.



"
anathura sidu wuye kawadada?,"The correct answer is **A: aelonsoge sewa naewathumata pasu wahama** (because of Alonso's service to the safety car).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Aelonsota idiriyaen aethi motor ratha aarakshitha motor rathaya pasupasa indhana labaagaenimata giya vita, ohu an tharangakaruwan pasu kota jayagrahanaya labuwaeya.""  This translates to ""Because Alonso helped provide fuel to the safety car when it ran out, he received praise from the race officials.""
* **Question Q asks:** ""anathura sidu wuye kawadada?"" (What was the reason for the praise?)
* **Option A** directly addresses the reason for the praise - Alonso's service related to the safety car.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: anek motar ratha indhana purawamin sitiya dee** (many motor vehicles were supplied with fuel) - This is a general statement not directly linked to the praise Alonso received.
* **C: aarakshitha motar rathaya eliyata paemineemata pera** (because the safety car ran out of fuel) - This is *the situation* that led to Alonso's action, not the reason *he* was praised.
* **D: pikat indhana piraweema sandaha giya pasu** (because of the fuel shortage for Piquet) -  The passage doesn't mention a fuel shortage for Piquet as the reason for the praise.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on how new bird species are *formed* through a long process.** It details the study of Darwin's finches and how they evolved over time. The core of the text is about the *change* in species, i.e., evolution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: visheshaye nirmanaya weema (formation of species):** While the passage *mentions* the formation of new species, it's not the central theme. It's about the *process* of how that formation happens.
* **B: visheshaya gaena waartha kirima (reporting on species):**  The passage describes research, but the main point isn't simply *reporting* on species, but understanding their development.
* **C: vividha vishesha athara prajananaya (diverse species and reproduction):** Reproduction is a component of evolution, but the passage doesn't primarily focus on the act of reproduction itself, but on the changes that lead to new species.



Therefore, **D** best encapsulates the central idea of the passage – the evolution of species."

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the formation of new bird species in the Galapagos Islands.** The entire text describes how research led to understanding the creation of new species (specifically finches) in that location.  The question asks what the researchers were investigating.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: parinameeya kriyawaliye diga (the length of evolutionary processes):** While the passage *implies* a long timeframe, the main focus isn't *how long* evolution takes, but *where* new species emerge.
    * **C: nawa visheshaye nama (the name of new species):**  The passage *mentions* names of finches (Darwin's finch, etc.) but naming them isn't the core investigation.
    * **D: prajananayata sambandha paksheen (relationships between breeding birds):** While breeding is part of evolution, the passage highlights the geographic location as crucial for speciation.



Therefore, option A best captures the primary subject of the research described in the passage."
kawpereid paewaethwenne koheda?,"The correct answer is **B: bukarest nagaraye** (Bucharest city).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states ""bukarest nagara shaalaave vyaapaarayaka kotasaki"" (Bucharest city hosts trade fairs).  The question asks where Cow Parade (a public art event) is held. The passage links the Cow Parade to Bucharest as being the first city in Europe to host it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: rumeniyanu nagara kihipayaka** (Romanian city list) - Too broad. The passage focuses on one city.
*   **C: ginikonadiga yuropaya puraa** (Old Europe/Western Europe) -  While Bucharest is *in* Western Europe, the question asks *where* the event takes place, not a general region.
*   **D: yuropeeya aganagara kihipayaka** (European capital city list) - Too broad, similar to A.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""ginikonadiga yuropayae palamu nagaraya maema nagaraya wae."" which translates to ""This city is the first city in Europe.""  It then continues to describe it hosting a large public art festival (""vishalathama mahajana kalaa ulela"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage mentions construction (""nirmanathmaka""), it doesn't say the festival *is* construction itself.
* **B:** Bukarest nagara shalaawa (Bucharest city hall) is mentioned as involved, but the question asks what the passage says the festival *is*, not who organizes it.
* **D:** While true, it's a description *of* the festival, not its defining characteristic highlighted in the passage as being the *first* of its kind in Europe.



Therefore, option C best reflects the key information provided in the passage regarding what makes this festival noteworthy."
II-76s bhaavithaya athhituweemata rusiyawata hethu wuye kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: soviyat hamudawa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""1970 gananvala sita rusiyaanu saha soviyat hamudaa dekehima pradhaana saadhakayakva paewathunae il-76 wana athara...""  This translates to ""In the 1970s, the IL-76 became a primary tool for the Russian and **Soviet Union** fleets..."" 

The question asks *why* the IL-76s were important to Russia.  The text directly links their importance to their use within the Soviet Union's fleet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: abhyanthara hamudawa (internal fleet):** While the IL-76 was used within Russia, the text emphasizes its broader role with the Soviet Union.
*   **B: anathurak (disaster/accident):** The text mentions an accident, but that doesn't explain *why* the IL-76 was important overall.
*   **D: vibhaaga wemin pawathina vimarshanayak (department-led investigation):** This refers to an investigation after an incident, not a reason for the plane's importance.



"
II-76 yanu kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: guvan yaanayak** (transport aircraft).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""1970 gananvala sita rusiyaanu saha soviyat hamudaa dekehima pradhaana saadhakayakva paewathunae il-76 wana athara..."" which translates to ""Since the 1970s, the Il-76 has been a major asset for the Russian and Soviet armies..."" and later refers to it as a ""guvan yaanaya"" (transport aircraft).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sabmaereenayak (submarine)** - The text doesn't mention submarines.
*   **B: yuda taenkiyak (war tank)** - The text doesn't mention tanks.
*   **D: dumriyak (truck)** - While Il-76s can *transport* things like trucks, it *is* not a truck itself.



"
da simpsans sandaha liweeme kandaayama kuliyata gaththe kawuda?,"The correct answer is **D: groyining**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""1989 dee ohu brooks saha **groninhata** da simpsans thaenimata sahaya labaa dun athara vaedasatahanae palamu laekhana kandaayama bandavaa gaeneemae wagakeema da daeruvaeya."" 

This translates to: ""In 1989, he, along with **Groning**, helped create the first written version of The Simpsons.""  This indicates Groning was involved in the creation of the show.

The question asks who helped create the Simpsons. Therefore, Groning is the correct answer.



"
"flookta anuwa, aeyata dhanaathmaka adahas saha dirigaenweem yawamin sitiye kawuda?","The correct answer is **A: vaid‍yawarun (doctors)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""Upath paalana aushadha, **vaidyamaya washayaen** athyavashya daeval laesa saelakimata polambawamin kaantha saha purusha daepaarshvayama visin aeyata evana lada **dhanaathmaka adahas saha dirigaenweem vishaala pramaanaya nisaa** aeya maema thiranayata elambunaaya.""

This translates to: ""Treatment, medicine, and **medical practices** are absolutely necessary to address the concerns of both men and women who are experiencing a lack of **positive impact and long-term results**.""

The question (Q) asks who is involved with ""dhanaathmaka adahas saha dirigaenweem"" (positive impact and long-term results).  The passage directly links these results to ""vaidyamaya washayaen"" - medical practices, and therefore to **vaidyawarun** (doctors).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: kaantha sawukya kriyakareen (health workers for women):** While important, the passage discusses both men and women.
*   **C: purushayin (men):** The passage addresses both genders.
*   **D: kaantha saha purusha depaarshawayama (both men and women):** They *receive* the treatment, but don't *provide* the positive results/long-term impact.

"mema chedayata anuwa, samaharun kaanthavan kumak pilibandawa viwurthawa katha kirimata akamaethi wuyeda?","The correct answer is **C: kaantha sawukyaya** (marital happiness/well-being of a couple).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P)** heavily focuses on the relationship between a husband and wife (""kaantha saha purusha""), their well-being, and the need for remedies/medicine to maintain a healthy relationship.  It discusses difficulties and the desire for a fulfilling connection.
* **The question (Q)** asks what the passage *primarily* discusses.
* **Option C** directly addresses this central theme – the happiness and well-being of a couple.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: pirimi pudgalayan (personal individuals)** – While the passage *mentions* individuals, it's always in the context of their relationship.
* **B: vaid‍ya viyadam (medical treatment)** – Medical treatment is *part* of the passage, but it's presented as a *means* to achieve marital happiness, not the main topic itself.
* **D: flook (a seemingly nonsensical word from the passage)** - The word ""flook"" appears in a negative context and isn't the core subject.



Therefore, **C** is the best and most accurate answer."
"mema chedayata anuwa, wadaathma gathikathawayakk dakwanne kumana graha wasthuwa da?","The correct answer is **B: tayitan (Saturn)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""...*taytanta vadaa gathikathvayak penwana graha vasthuvak aethae ekak pamani, ehi nama pruthuwiyay.*""  This translates to ""...like a story written beyond Saturn, this is called Earth.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly identifies Saturn (""tayitan"") as the planet beyond which Earth's story is written.  The question asks which planet the story is written *beyond*.



"
vinivida penena diyarayak sahitha ganga saha vil handunaagena aeththe kumana graha wasthuwaka da?,"The correct answer is **B: tayitan (Saturn)**.

Here's how we can deduce this from the provided text (P):

* **""Eya jalaya maen vinivida paeney.""** - This translates to ""It has rings around it.""
* **""apa dannaa tharamata, taytanta vadaa gathikathvayak penwana graha vasthuvak aethae ekak pamani, ehi nama pruthuwiyay.""** -  This translates to ""As we know from the stars, it is one of the celestial bodies with a complex story around it, and it is named after the father (of the gods).""

Saturn (Tayitan in Sinhala) is famous for its prominent rings.  It's also named after the Roman god Saturn, who is the father of Jupiter (and equivalent to the Greek god Cronus, the father of the gods).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: brahaspathi (Jupiter)** - Jupiter is large and has moons, but is not known for rings in the same way as Saturn.
* **C: suryaya (Sun)** - The Sun is a star, not a planet with rings.
* **D: senasuru (Mars)** - Mars doesn't have significant rings.



"
pihatu soyagaeneeme prathiphalayak nowanne mema soyagaeneem walin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: pihatu parinamaya pilibanda awabodhaya** (understanding of dinosaur evolution).

Here's why:

The passage heavily focuses on how dinosaur fossils provide insights into their evolution. It discusses:

* **Changes over time:**  Mentioning features like hind limbs and forelimbs evolving.
* **Developmental stages:**  Comparing young and adult dinosaurs to understand growth and changes.
* **Adaptation:** How features might have helped dinosaurs regulate temperature.
* **Understanding relationships:**  How fossils help piece together the evolutionary history of dinosaurs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sathwayage pihatuwala warnaya** (the color of dinosaur skin) - While the passage touches on skin features, it doesn't primarily focus on *color*.
* **B: piyasara kirima sandaha pihatu bhaavitha nokarana lada bawa awabodha kara gaeneema** (understanding how fossils didn't decay due to favorable climatic conditions) -  The passage mentions fossil preservation, but it's not the main takeaway.
* **D: boho dynosarayanta pihatu thiboo bawa thahawuru kirima** (determining how many dinosaurs existed) -  The passage doesn't address the *number* of dinosaurs, but rather what we can *learn* from their remains.



Therefore, the passage’s primary focus is on the **understanding of dinosaur evolution** gleaned from fossils."
dynosarayange pihatu wala nothibune kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: waedihiti pihatu** (vestigial structures).

Here's why:

The text explicitly discusses how dinosaur hatchlings had features like ""naarati saha pichkaanga"" (limbs - referring to wings and fins) that, over evolutionary time, became vestigial – meaning they remained but served no real purpose.  The text connects this to understanding evolutionary relationships.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: pichkanga (fins/wings):** While mentioned, the text focuses on *what happened to* those structures over time, not just their existence.
* **B: prakshaya (decay/destruction):** This refers to extinction, which is a broader concept than the specific focus on remnants of features.
* **D: yatin sudumaeli paata (a song about a dark cave):** This is irrelevant to the content of the passage.



Therefore, ""waedihiti pihatu"" (vestigial structures) is the most accurate answer to the question of what the passage discusses about dinosaur hatchlings."
ZMApp pilibandawa sathya nowanne pahatha sandahan prakaashayangen kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: eyata pawathina aasadana walata prathikara kala haeki namuth maranaya walakwa gaeneemata eyata haekiyawak naetha** (it doesn't guarantee recovery even if administered early in the course of the disease, and may not prevent death).

* **The passage states:** ""Ek pratidaeha mishrakala paanayak wana ZMapp, shethraya thula yam balaaporottuvak daelwuwada, vidhimath adyayana magin paennum kalae marana vaelaekvima sandahaa eya apekshaa kala mattamata vadaa adu prathiphalayak gaena daena bavay.""  This translates to: ""ZMapp, a cocktail of antibodies, even when administered early, studies show it doesn't guarantee recovery or prevent death.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eya prathideha walin saedee aetha** (it is made from antibodies) - While true, this isn't the *main* point about its effectiveness.
* **C: eya PALM athhada baeleemedee paalithayak lesa kaaryabharayak itu kaleya** (it took on a role in the PALM athhada baeleeme study) - The passage mentions PALM, but it’s about *researching* ZMapp, not its role *in* the study itself.
* **D: adhyayanawalin heli wee aeththe ehi prathilaabha mulin sithuwata wadaa adu bawayi** (studies have shown some benefit in certain cases) - The passage explicitly states it doesn't *guarantee* benefit and may not prevent death, so this is misleading.



"
PALM athhada baeleema niwaeradiwa visthara karanne pahatha sandahan prakaashawalin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: paalaka awshadhayak wenath prathikaara thunak samaga sansandanaya karana lada athara in ekak ZMApp viya** (meaning: like a protective medicine that is connected with some kind of antidote, that's what ZMapp is).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""PALM athhadaa baelimaedee ZMapp paalithayak laesa salakanu labini, enam vidyaagnayo eya padanamak laesa salakaa, waenath prathikaara thunak samaga sansandanaya kaloya.""  This directly translates to ""PALM couldn't find a clear explanation for ZMapp's protection, scientists couldn't find a clear way it works, but it seems to be connected to some kind of antidote.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage mentions *potential* benefits, but doesn't definitively state they were *achieved*.
* **C:** The passage says scientists *couldn't* find a clear way it works, not that it's based on herbal remedies.
* **D:**  The passage highlights the difficulty in understanding *how* it works, not whether it's effective.



"
nawa chipaya wadaathma waedagath wanu aeththe kohedaeyi paryeshakayan sithanne da?,"The correct answer is **B: dhanawath ratawal**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...*pradhaana pelae paryaeshakayan pawasana paridi maemagin, piyayuru pilikaa waeni roga thathwayanhidi **dhanavath ratawalata** vadaa jivath weemae sambaawithaawa ardhayakin pamana adu wana...*"" 

This translates to: ""...primarily, examining the spread, especially concerning prevalent infectious diseases, significantly reduces mortality in **wealthy countries** by half...""

The question asks where the new chip (presumably related to the discussed technology) would be most effective in examination. The text directly links the technology's benefit to reduced mortality in ""dhanawath ratawal"" (wealthy countries).



"
dosha nirnaya kirime upakaranaya godanaengeema sandaha kumana kramawedaya bhaavitha karayi da?,"The correct answer is **D: wenath dosha nirnaya kirime mewalam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...*nava dosha nirnaya kirime maevalamak*..."" (a valuable tool for determining new ailments/defects).  The question asks about the *upakaranaya* (tool) used for *dosha nirnaya kirime* (determining ailments/defects).  ""mewalam"" means ""tool"" or ""instrument"".
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **A:** ""saema ekakatama eksath janapada shatha ekak"" - This refers to a community, not a tool.
    * **B:** ""saaman‍ya inkjet mud‍rana yanthrayak"" - This is a common inkjet printer.
    * **C:** ""mud‍ranaya kala haeki chipayak"" - This is a cheap printed item.

Therefore, the passage directly identifies *wenath dosha nirnaya kirime mewalam* as the tool being discussed.

"mema chedayata anuwa, sakhanditha mohora pilibanda sathya nowanne kumana prakaashaya da?","The correct answer is **C: samahara vita eya chand‍rayage haekileeme prathiphalayak viya haekiya** (meaning: generally, it is like a reflection of the moon's light).

Here's why, breaking down the original text (P) and the question (Q):

* **P is describing a phenomenon related to the moon (chandrayaa).** It talks about light (""vidyaagnayo,"" ""aethi woo bhava paenaena,"" ""prawaashayata patahaeni wae""), and specifically links it to the moon. It also mentions a ""sakhinditha mohora"" (a specific mark/sign), and suggests this sign is revealed or made visible by something connected to knowledge (""vidyaathmaka"").  The text implies this 'mark' isn't inherent, but *shown* through something else.
* **Q asks about the truth regarding the ""sakhanditha mohora.""**  It asks what reveals it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ewa nirmanaya karana lada siduweem maethakadee sidu wee thibeemata ida aetha:** (This is the result of building something, this is what the established principle says) - This doesn't address what *reveals* the mark.
* **B: ema siduweem walin adahas wanne chand‍rayage bhoo goleeya kriyakareethwayangen aduwak nopawathina bawayi:** (This result is not understood without the geometrical actions of the moon) - While the moon is involved, this is overly complex and doesn't directly answer what *shows* the mark.
* **D: ewayin bohomayak sanda mathupita hamu noweeya:** (In this way, many good fathers are not involved) - Completely irrelevant to the context.

**Option C directly addresses the revealing aspect.** The text is suggesting the 'sakhinditha mohora' isn't a source of light itself, but appears *because of* reflected light – similar to how we see the moon’s reflection.  This aligns with the descriptive language in P.



Therefore, **C** is the most logical and contextually accurate answer."
"mema chedayata anuwa, chand‍raya matha bhoo vid‍yathmaka kriyaakaarakam siduwana bawata penwana bhoo haedayan pilibanda n‍yaya wanne kumakda?","Let's break down the question and the provided text to determine the correct answer.

**Understanding the Text (P):**

The text (P) discusses a journey or pursuit – a seeking of wisdom (""vidyaagnayo""). It talks about overcoming obstacles (""sakhanditha mohora,"" ""laesa haedinvaena"") to achieve a certain understanding (""bhurupa soyaaagena"").  It emphasizes the importance of both reasoning (""nyaaya"") and experiential knowledge (""vidyaathmaka kriyaakaarakam"") in achieving completion (""sampurnayaenma"").  Essentially, it's a metaphorical description of a spiritual or intellectual quest.

**Understanding the Question (Q):**

The question (Q) asks: ""According to this text, what does the moon (chandraya) represent concerning the completion of the earth's (bhoo) heart/mind (haedayan) and the principles (nyaya) regarding it?""  It's asking for the moon's symbolic role in achieving understanding of the earth's core principles.

**Analyzing the Answer Options:**

* **A: sanda semen haekilemin pawathee (It speaks of a beautiful seed)** - This is too vague and doesn't relate to the core theme of the text.
* **B: mema bhoo haedayan boho kalakata pera nirmanaya wee aetha (This builds the earth's heart over many eras)** - While it mentions the earth's heart, it doesn't explain the role of the moon or the *principles* (nyaya) related to it.
* **C: chand‍raya mathupita bhoo haedayan awama pramaanayaka pawathee (The moon is the father and a standard for the earth's heart)** - This option directly relates the moon (""chandraya"") to the earth's heart (""bhoo haedayan"") and implies it provides a standard or guidance, fitting the context of seeking understanding.  The text's emphasis on reasoning and experiential knowledge suggests looking for guiding influences.
* **D: mema bhoo haedayan tharamak maethakadee nirmanaya wee aetha (This builds the earth's heart in stages)** - Similar to option B, it describes a process, but lacks the crucial connection to the moon and principles.

**Conclusion:**

Option **C** is the most fitting answer. The text’s focus on seeking wisdom and employing both reason and experience aligns with the idea of the moon serving as a guiding standard for understanding the earth's deeper principles.  The ""father"" metaphor in option C suggests a foundational source of knowledge or guidance.



Therefore, the correct answer is **C**."
"mema chedayata anuwa, adhichodanaa gonu karana thek thawath sidu nowanu aeththe kumak da?","The correct answer is **B: chayaroopa prasiddha kirima** (famous sculptural decree).

Here's why:

* **The passage heavily focuses on a famous sculptural decree (chayaroopa prasiddha kirima).** It describes its appearance, location (Eksath raajadhaniye - united capital), and the context around its discovery and interpretation. Pamela Fargiyusan's quote directly refers to it as ""saekakaruvangae chaayarupa prasiddha kalahoth maadhyavaedinta anathurudaayaka thathwayak aethi wana bhava penae"" (a well-crafted sculptural decree that is a testament to the ancient worldview).
* **The question asks what the investigation is *about*.** The entire text centers around uncovering information about this decree.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: waedidura adahas daekweem (secret ancient documents):** While the decree *is* ancient, the investigation isn't about all ancient documents, but specifically this one.
* **C: aesin dutu saakshi pilibanda sakachcha kirim (investigation regarding emissary/messenger witnesses):** This is a minor aspect mentioned, related to the decree's discovery, but not the central focus.
* **D: lipi prakaashana (script publication):** The publication of the script is a *result* of the investigation, not the investigation itself.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, seel masun dadayam karannanta warthamana gaetaluwak nowanne kumak da?","The correct answer is **A: daedi kaalaguna thaththwayan**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""...what is mentioned about those who don't offer cool water?"" (implied from ""warthamana gaetaluwak nowanne kumak da?"" - what is not mentioned about those who don't offer cool water?)
* **The passage states:** ""Kaedaena ayisvalata amatarava, **daedi kaalaguna thathwayan** da beraa gaeneeme prayathnavalata baadhaa wee aetha."" -  Those who don't offer cool water to travelers face obstacles.  This directly addresses what happens to those who *don't* offer cool water.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ayis praamanaya** - refers to a vast and deep ocean.  It doesn't relate to offering or *not* offering water.
* **C: ayis wala ghanakama** - refers to the density of the ocean.  Again, irrelevant to the question.
* **D: ayis unu weema** - refers to the existence of the ocean.  Also irrelevant.



Therefore, only **daedi kaalaguna thaththwayan** (those who don't offer cool water) directly answers what is mentioned about those who don't perform the act."
"ayis walata amatharawa, beraa gaeneeme prayathnawalata thawath balapanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: kaalaguna thaththwayan**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is hindering the efforts to save the ship?
* **The passage states:** ""daedi kaalaguna thathwayan da beraa gaeneeme prayathnavalata baadhaa wee aetha"" which translates to ""due to the unfavorable weather, there is an obstacle to the efforts to save the ship.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: pramaanawath saepayumak nomaethi weema:** This refers to not being able to estimate the size of the ocean.
* **C: pramaanawath udaw nomaethikama:** This refers to not being able to help estimate.
* **D: seel masun dadayam karannan:** This refers to not being able to cool down.



Therefore, **kaalaguna thaththwayan (unfavorable weather)** is the direct answer to what's hindering the rescue efforts."
robarts thahawuru kirimen waelakee sitiye kumana vishwaasayada?,"The correct answer is **A: nadu pilibanda saakachcha kirime dee sadachaara sampanna bawa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...robarts thadinma pratiksepa kala athara, gabsava pilibanda aachara dharma salakaa baeleeme dee vaedagat prasnayak lesa paewasuwe evaeni siddhin suvisesikaranaya pilibandava adahas daekweema sadachara sampanna novena bavayi.""  This translates to something along the lines of ""...Robarts rejected, considering the teachings of conduct and religion, and didn't find fulfillment in inquiries about doctrine; instead, he became a person of good character.""

Therefore, Robarts' belief (thahavuru kirimen waelakee sitiye) is related to being a person of good character (nadu pilibanda saakachcha kirime dee sadachaara sampanna bawa).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: sh‍reshtaadhikaranaye sthaawara theendu wala waedagathkama:**  This refers to pursuing spiritual knowledge, which the passage says Robarts *didn't* find fulfilling.
* **C: jiwaye aarambhaya:** This refers to the beginning of life, not Robarts' belief.
* **D: pawudgalikathwayata aethi ayithiya:** This refers to individuality, which isn't explicitly mentioned as Robarts' belief.



"
saakachcha kirimata ithamath sadaachaara virodhee yaeyi robarts haegune kumana maathrukawada?,"Let's break down the question and the provided text to find the answer.

**The Question:** ""Is Robarts accused of being against good morals? What doctrine is he associated with?""  Essentially, we're looking for what belief system Robarts is linked to that *might* be considered immoral based on the text.

**Analyzing the Text (P):**  The text is dense and uses archaic language, but key phrases are:

*   ""...*visvaasa karanne kavadaa sita da yanna keema robarts*..."" (believes in/follows Robarts) - Robarts is a figure of belief.
*   ""...*pratiksepa kala athara*..."" (rejects/denies) - There's something Robarts is rejecting.
*   ""...*sadachara sampanna novena bavayi*..."" (not possessing good morals/conduct) - This is a direct accusation of lacking good morals.
*   ""...*gam‍yamana pawudgalikathwayata aethi gamyamaana ayitiya*..."" (a going towards individualistic existence)
*   ""...*bhoomiye sthaapitha woo nithiya*..."" (established on earth, eternity)

**Evaluating the Options:**

*   **A: sh‍reshtaadhikaranaye sthaawara theendu** (superior authority's permanent stance) - While potentially related to the beliefs discussed, it doesn't directly answer the question of *what* Robarts believes or why he's accused of immorality.
*   **B: royi v. -wed ediriwa naduwe theenduwa** (Roy V. - between opposing wedges) - This doesn't connect to Robarts or the moral accusation.
*   **C: gam‍yamana pawudgalikathwayata aethi ayithiya** (a going towards individualistic existence) -  The text links Robarts to a rejection of something, and this option, *especially* in context with the accusations of lacking morals, suggests that Robarts promotes individualism, potentially against established societal norms and dharma (duty/morality).  This is a strong contender.
*   **D: nadu wala visheshitha karunu** (specified in the middle of the country) - This is irrelevant to the question.

**Conclusion:**

Option **C: gam‍yamana pawudgalikathwayata aethi ayithiya** is the most likely answer. The text implies Robarts is associated with a philosophy of individualistic existence, which the context suggests is seen as a rejection of traditional morality (""sadachara sampanna novena bavayi"").



Therefore, the answer is **C**."
aaloka kadambha deka baebalenne koheda?,"The correct answer is **A: ahasa desata** (to the sky).

The passage states: ""Aaloka kadamba dekak raathri kalaye ihala ahasata ella wana lesa sakasaa aetha."" which translates to ""A cluster of light rose and spread across the upper sky like a wave at night.""  

Therefore, the light cluster rose **to the sky**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: nagaraya haraha** (to the city) - The passage doesn't say the light went *to* the city, only that the city became silent.
*   **C: palamu jet yanaye ilakkaya wetha** (the location of the first jet's destination) - The light is described rising, not going towards the jet's destination.
*   **D: smarana ud‍yaanaya maeda** (above the memorial park) - The passage only mentions the memorial park as a landmark the light passed *near*, not where it went *to*.

"mema chedayata anuwa, mema sthaanaye nawa us godanaegili idi karanu laebuwe kawadada?","The correct answer is **D: idikirim katayuthu sidu wemin pawathee**.

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Mehi nava us godaenagili pahak, pravaahana madyasthaanayak saha madyaye smarana udyaanayak sandaha wana idikireem katayutu sidu keremin pawathee.""  This directly translates to: ""Here, a new sprouting grass was seen, reaching the traffic intersection and the memorial garden in the middle, extending towards the direction where the ruins were being built.""

* **The question (Q) asks:**  ""Following this event, who would be able to do new sprouting in this place?""  The passage explicitly states the new grass is *growing towards* where ruins are being rebuilt (""idikirim katayuthu sidu wemin pawathee"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: dawase maeda (during the day):** The passage describes events at 8:46 AM, which is daytime, but it doesn't connect daytime to the ability of new growth.
* **B: ude 8:46 ta (at 8:46 AM):** This is the *time* of the event, not who is doing the growing.
* **C: raathriyehi (at night):** The passage describes a dark night sky, but doesn't say anything about growth happening at night.



"
sewan sistars yanu guhaa bawata hangawana thorathuru monawada?,"The correct answer is **B: guhaa pivisum wala vishkambhaya**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states:  ""sevan sisters yaeyi nam karana lada guhaa **pivisumvala avama washayen meetara 100 sita 250 dakva (2di 328 sita 820 dakva) vishkambhaya sahitayi**.""  This translates to ""the Seven Sisters are named after a cave with entrances ranging from 100 to 250 meters (2 to 328 to 820 feet) **with skylights**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ushnathwa wenas weem** (temperature differences) - While temperature is *mentioned* in the passage, it's not what the caves are known *for*.
*   **C: bhoo vid‍yathmaka sameekshana** (geological survey) - This refers to the source of the information (USGS), not a characteristic of the caves themselves.
*   **D: pruthuviye guhaa wala pinthura** (paintings in the earth's caves) -  The passage doesn't mention any paintings.



"
sewan sistars ge thaapa haesireema nireekshanaya karanne keseda?,"The correct answer is **D: pruthiviye guhaa pilibanda sameekshana** (research on Earth's caves).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...aerisonaahi, flagstaf hi pihiti uthuru aerisona vishwa vidyaalaye aemarikaa eksath janapada bhuvidyaatmaka samikshana (usgs) abyavakaasa bhu vidyaa kandaayame glen kushin paewaseeya.""  This translates to ""...research by the US Geological Survey (USGS) at the Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff.""  This clearly indicates the research is focused on Earth's geology and specifically, based on the overall context of the passage, caves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: adhoraktha roopa magin** (in opaque form) - This refers to how heat is observed, not *who* is observing.
*   **B: polowe gaemburu siduru** (polar gamburu siduru) - This refers to a specific location.
*   **C: guhaawala vishkambhaya** (cave formations) - While the passage discusses caves, it's not about the formations *themselves*, but the research being done *on* them.

"mema chedayata anuwa, saekakaru pilibanda sathya nowana prakaashaya wanne kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: ohuge janawargikathwaya baladhaareenta dannaa karunaki** (He revealed the truth about his social class by acting powerfully).

Here's why:

* **P's context:** The passage describes someone who initially appears humble (""minisa pupurana..."") but then displays power and control (""senaga madyayata dhaawanaya kala bavata chodanaa kere"").  It contrasts this with a pretense of being ordinary (""Bombaya pupuruva haerime saekayata bhaajanaya""). The last sentence explicitly states his true identity was hidden, and his actions revealed it.
* **Q's question:**  The question asks who revealed the truth about their social standing.
* **Analyzing the options:**
    * **A:** Talks about imagining a vehicle – irrelevant.
    * **B:**  Refers to the initial humble act – doesn’t reveal the truth.
    * **C:** Directly addresses the idea of revealing a social class through powerful action, which aligns with the passage's meaning. This is the key revelation.
    * **D:**  About not getting benefits – doesn't connect to revealing a truth.

Therefore, **C** is the most logical and accurate answer based on the provided text.

prahaaraya sambandhayen baladhaareen thahawuru kara aethi thorathuru monawada?,"The question (Q) asks about what the passage (P) suggests regarding the motivations of the powerful (""baladhaareen"") in relation to attacks (""prahaaraya"").  Let's break down the passage to find the clue:

* **""Ohu uyigar jana kandaayame saamaajikayeku bhava misa ohuge nama thawamath baladhaarin nodani.""** This translates to something like: ""He didn't care about his name or the powerful, only about the welfare of the people and society.""  This is *crucial*.

This sentence implies the powerful are *not* motivated by societal welfare or their reputation. They are acting for other reasons. The closest answer choice that reflects this is **C: prahaaraya pitupasa aethi abhipreranaya** (the intention behind attacks). 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: siyalu sahayakayinge anan‍yathawa** (otherwise, all assistants) - irrelevant to the motivations of the powerful.
* **B: saekakaruge janawargikathwaya** (the demographics of the century) -  irrelevant to the motivations of the powerful.
* **D: saekakaruge palamu saha awasana nama** (the first and last name of the century) - clearly irrelevant.

elis park hi paewaethwena tharagayedee kumana kandaayam kreedaa karanu aethda?,"The correct answer is **C: dakunu aprikaava saha ost‍reliyawa** (South Africa and Australia).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tharaga malave avasan tharagaya, springbok saha oustreliyava athara, eelanga sathiye johaennasbarg elis park hi paewaethwenu aetha."" This translates to: ""The final match of the tournament was played, with Springbok and Australia participating, at Ellis Park in Johannesburg.""

Therefore, the match played at Ellis Park involved South Africa (Springboks) and Australia.



"
springboksge eelanga tharagaya kreedaa karanne koheda?,"The correct answer is **C: johaennasbarg**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""springbok saha oustreliyava athara, eelanga sathiye **johaennasbarg** elis park hi paewaethwenu aetha.""  This translates to ""Springboks and Australia played, the home game for the Springboks was at **Johannesburg** Ellis Park.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ostreliyawa** - Australia is a team they play *against*, not where they play their home games.
*   **B: rastenberg** - Rastenberg is mentioned in relation to a previous game, but not as the Springboks' home ground.
*   **D: navasilanthaya** - Navasilanthaya (New Zealand) is also a team they play against.



"
meheyuma atharathura abhyawakasha madyasthaanayata sidu wu karadara pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: vibhramanekshayak pawathwa gaeneema**.

Here's why:

* **P's text** describes a journey through the *abyavakaasa madyasthaana* (intermediate space of the void) and mentions *vibhramanekshayak* (delusion/confusion). It then states the journey leads to a realization/understanding (""pavatvaa gene giye ya"").  The text also mentions protecting oneself from difficulties (""aarakshitha durakin sitina bavayi"").
* **Q's question** asks what happens after reaching the *abyavakaasa madyasthaanaya* (intermediate space of the void).
* **Option B (""vibhramanekshayak pawathwa gaeneema"" - understanding the end of delusion)** directly aligns with the idea that the journey through the void *leads to* overcoming delusion/confusion, as described in text P.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: therapanayangen niwaeradi dura pawathwa gaeneema** - While *therapanaya* (protection) is mentioned, it's about protecting *from* difficulties, not a result *of* reaching the intermediate space.
* **C: jet sakreeya kirima** - This refers to a sacred pillar and doesn't relate to the journey's outcome.
* **D: saaman‍ya aakalpaya naewatha laba gaeneema** -  This refers to obtaining common conceptions or gains, which doesn't fit the described spiritual journey and realization.



Therefore, **B** is the most logical and contextually relevant answer."
"mema chedayata anuwa, abhyawakasha madyasthaana meheyume aramuna kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: ahimi wu vibhramanekshayak soya gaeneema**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""P: ...da abyavakaasa gamana avasan wana thek madyasthaanaya siya aakalpaya novenasva pavatvaa gene giye ya. Chiyao saha sharipov vaarthaa kale dishanathi **saekasum terapanayangen aarakshitha durakin sitina bavayi**. Rusiyanu bhoomi paalanaya jet yaana sakreeya kala athara dumriya sthaanaye saamanya aakalpaya nawatha labaa ganna ladi.""

And the question is: ""Q: mema chedayata anuwa, abhyawakasha madyasthaana meheyume aramuna kumakda?"" (Following this story, what is near the middle of the uninhabited space?)

The passage explicitly mentions that the middle of the uninhabited space is protected by the *saekasum therapanaya* (threefold doctrine) and is where a distressed person finds refuge (""durakin sitina bavayi""). However, the phrasing in the question implies a direct reference to something *within* the uninhabited space, not a protective layer around it.

Looking at the options:

*   **A: ahimi wu vibhramanekshayak soya gaeneema** translates to ""it is where those who are lost in delusion find peace"".  This aligns with the context of someone seeking refuge within the uninhabited space. The passage suggests it's a place of quiet and escape from confusion.
*   **B: saekasum therapanayata sameepa weema** (near the threefold doctrine) - While the *saekasum therapanaya* protects the area, it isn't *in* the middle of it.
*   **C: abhyawakasha gamanak sampoorna kirima** (completing the uninhabited journey) - This is too broad and doesn't pinpoint a location.
*   **D: jet yanaa sakreeya kirima** (completing the sacred journey) - This also refers to a process, not a place.



Therefore, **A** is the most logical and contextually relevant answer. It describes the state of peace and refuge found within the uninhabited space."

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) is about a situation where a country (the ""nadu"") is being powered by electricity, specifically mentioning power lines and a system that benefits power suppliers.** The question (Q) asks about the truth regarding this situation.
* **Option A directly addresses the core issue: the country being powered by EOL (presumably a power company) from a specific region.** This aligns perfectly with the passage's description of electricity supply.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: waradakaruweku karana ladee** (Regarding what power suppliers do) -  While suppliers are *mentioned* in the passage, it's not the central truth being revealed.
    * **C: mema naduwedee ayaachitha thaepael pilibanda neethi bhaavitha karana ladee** (Regarding the ethics of voluntary power in this country) -  The passage doesn't discuss ethics.
    * **D: e. o. el hata chodanaa gonu karana ladee** (Regarding EOL making requests) -  Requests are mentioned, but aren't the fundamental truth about the situation.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate and relevant answer based on the information provided in the passage."

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) clearly states:** ""...eya chodana gonukala pramukha pele antharjaala sevaa saepayumkaruveku wana aol hi nivahana wana baevini"" which translates to ""...this is a country that operates with the aim of providing internet services as its main function.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: e. o. el hata illum nokala bedahaereema sambandhayen chodanaa ella viya** (the request is about E.O.L and not being able to find information) - While mentioned, it's a detail *within* the larger context of the country's function.
* **C: 2003 dee naduwa pawaranu laebeeya** (the country was powered in 2003) - This refers to electrification and is a past event, not the current primary function.
* **D: e. o. el mema naduwa paewareema aarambha kaleya** (E.O.L was the beginning of this country) - Incorrect.  E.O.L is about finding information, not the country's origin.

Therefore, option B directly addresses the main function described in the passage.

* **The question asks:** Which society held games *after* the Vidaal?

Since the passage explicitly mentions the ""Kaetalan"" society held games after Vidaal, **Katalaan** is the correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: seweelaa:** Not mentioned in the passage.
* **C: barchaa:** Mentioned, but doesn't relate to games held *after* Vidaal.
* **D: kapital:** Not mentioned in the passage.

The passage states ""Jaark edina udaesana itaaliye kavarsiyaanohi purva-vaara puhunuvim wala yedee sitiyeya."" This translates to ""Jaark was in Italy's Kavarsiyaano region on the western side of the previous week.""  Therefore, the passage establishes that Jaark was in Italy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: jark** - This is the *name* of the person, not a place.
*   **B: boloniya** - Boloniya (Bologna) is a city *within* Italy, but not the overarching location mentioned in the beginning.
*   **C: kowarsiyano** - Kavarsiyaano is a region *within* Italy, again not the main location.



"

* **The passage states:** ""Jaark edina udaesana itaaliye kavarsiyaanohi purva-vaara puhunuvim wala yedee sitiyeya.""  This translates to ""Jaark felt comfortable during his stay in Italy, specifically the previous week.""  This directly answers the question of whether Jaark felt comfortable in the hotel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ohu poorwa-wara raesweemak thibuni** (He was traveling the previous week) - The passage mentions the *feeling* during the week, not simply travel.
* **C: ohu irida tharagayak thibuni** (He had a plan for tomorrow) -  The passage talks about enjoying his stay and accommodation, not future plans.
* **D: ohu boloniyawa samaga puhunu wemin sitiyeya** (He felt comfortable with Bologna) - While he enjoyed Bologna, the question is about his feeling *in the hotel*.

jakartha bhoo goleeya bhawthika niyojithayathanaya anathuru aengaweemak nikuth nokale aeyi?,"The question (Q) asks: ""Did the Jakarta Geological and Physical Planning Agency issue a tsunami warning?""

Let's analyze the passage (P):

* It states a 6.5 magnitude earthquake occurred, but **did not meet the criteria** for a tsunami warning.
* It then says a tsunami occurred *despite* not meeting the criteria, causing damage and panic.

Therefore, the Jakarta Geological and Physical Planning Agency **did not** issue a tsunami warning.

Now let's look at the options:

* **A: sunaamiyaka tharjanayak nothibuni** - ""a tsunami warning was not issued"" - **This is the correct answer.**
* B: nevaasikayan santhrasayata path weema walakwa gaeneemata - ""damage occurred to the public's trade and residence"" - This is a *result* of the tsunami, not whether a warning was issued.
* C: desheeya vyaaparawalata balapaemak aethi weema walakwa gaeneema - ""damage occurred to national trade"" - Similar to B, a result, not the warning.
* D: eya kampanayak sandaha wu pramaana awashyathawaya sapuranu nolaebeeya - ""it did not meet the criteria of the required magnitude of the earthquake"" -  This explains *why* a warning wasn't issued, but doesn't directly answer the question of whether one *was* issued.



**Therefore, the correct answer is A.**"

* **The passage (P) states:** ""...nevasikayin santraasayata path wee ovunge vyaapara saha nivaasa valin pita weemata patan gathha.""  This translates to ""...causing damage to the businesses and residences of people living in the affected areas.""
* **Question (Q) asks:** ""Following this incident, who was affected?""

Therefore, the people living in the affected areas are the ones who experienced the consequences of the tsunami.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: sunaami tharjanayak** (tsunami perpetrator) - A tsunami *is* an event, not a being who causes harm.
* **C: nikuth karana lada anathuru aengaweemak** (factors that cause the tsunami) - The passage describes the *impact* of the tsunami, not its causes.
* **D: 6.5 ka vishaalathwa parimanayak** (6.5 magnitude) - This refers to the earthquake's magnitude, not who was affected.



"
me atharin suryayage saha anekuth tharakawala kriyakareethwayata hethu wanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: rosi ankaya, bhramanaya saha chumbaka prathyaavarthana**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""...Rosby ankaya kudaa wana tharamata, chumbaka prathyaavartanavalata sapeksava tharuva adu kriyaakari bavak dakvayi."" (Rosby number also acts as a factor for stars, relative to magnetic reversals.)  It also links the Rosby number, rotation (bhramanaya) and luminosity (diptiya) to the star's activity.
* **The question (Q) asks:** What causes the activity of the sun and many stars?

Let's break down why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: deepthiya saha plaasma prawahaya (luminosity and plasma flow):** While luminosity is mentioned, it's presented as *resulting* from the activity, not the primary *cause*. Plasma flow is also mentioned but not as a driving factor.
* **C: bhramanaya saha deepthiya (rotation and luminosity):**  Again, luminosity is a result, not a cause.  Rotation is important, but not the whole picture.
* **D: deepthiya, rosbi ankaya saha bhramanaya (luminosity, Rosby number and rotation):** While more complete than A and C, the passage explicitly links the Rosby number *to magnetic reversals* and its impact on stellar activity, making B the most encompassing and accurate answer.



Therefore, **B** most accurately reflects the driving forces behind stellar activity as described in the passage."
tharakawaka rosbi ankaya theeranaya wanne keseda?,"The correct answer is **A: deepthiya saha bhramanaya (depth and rotation)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""...Rosby ankaya tirana kirimata **diptiya saha bramanaya** ekva bhavitha kere."" (The Rosby number is formed by a single effect of **depth and rotation**.)

Therefore, the Rosby number is determined by depth and rotation. The other options are mentioned in the passage but aren't identified as determining factors for the Rosby number itself.



"
ost‍reliyawa wahama janarajayak bawata pathweemata sahaya dakwana sameekshanayata lak kala pudgalayinge prathishathaya kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: siyayata 29**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Chanda vimasima avasaanaye dee samikshanayata paathra woo ayagen 29% k haeki ikmanin oustreliyaava janarajayak viya yuthu bhava visvaasa karana athara...""

This translates to: ""At the end of the poll, 29% of those surveyed believed Australia would become a republic.""

Therefore, 29% of people supported Australia becoming a republic.



"
"julee gilaardta anuwa, ost‍reliyawa janarajayak bawata pathviya yuththe kawadada?","The correct answer is **A: haeki ikmanin (29%)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Chanda vimasima avasaanaye dee samikshanayata paathra woo ayagen 29% k haeki ikmanin oustreliyaava janarajayak viya yuthu bhava visvaasa karana athara...""  This translates to ""After the election review, 29% of people believed Australia would become a republic.""

The question asks about the percentage who believed Australia would become a republic following Julia Gillard's actions. The text directly provides this information as 29%.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: dewana elisabeth raejinage palana samayen pasu:** The text mentions Elizabeth's reign, but doesn't state a percentage related to republican sentiment *during* her rule.
*   **C: kisi vitekath naetha:** The text states 31% didn't believe Australia would become a republic, not how many believed it wouldn't happen at all.
*   **D: fedaral chandayen pasu:** The federal election is mentioned, but the relevant percentage is tied to the post-election *review*, not the election itself.



"
neethimaya vimarshanayata bhajanaya wana sanvidhaanaya kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: saelasumgatha demapiyabhawaya**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""saelasumgatha demapiyabhawaya aayatanaya komange pratipattiya magin nusudusu bavata path karana ladi"" which translates to ""limited discussion for the purpose of establishing a democratic environment based on the practices of various organizations."" This directly links the constitution to a democratic environment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: gruhastha balashakthi ha wanija kamituva (domestic power and commercial activity)** - While mentioned in the passage as areas of oversight, they are not *the* constitution itself.
*   **B: komen padanama (mentioned name)** - This refers to a person's name and isn't related to the constitution's core.
*   **D: adheekshana ha vimarshana anukamituva (oversight and following up on criticism)** - This is a *function* related to the constitution (how it's managed) but not the constitution itself.



"
klif stiyarns kumana kamituwe pradhaaniya da?,"The correct answer is **D: adheekshana ha vimarshana anukamituva** (oversight and following up on reviews).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gruhastha balashakthi ha vaanija kamituva yatathe pawathina **adhikshana ha vimarsana anukamituve sabhaapativaraya** lesa ohuge kaaryabhaaraya thula saelasumgata demaapiyabhaavaya haraha gabsaavan sandaha aramudal yedavimata badhu bhavitha karanne daeyi sterns vimarsanaya karayi.""

This translates to: ""...as the chairman of the oversight and review follow-up committee regarding household power and commercial activity...""  This clearly indicates Cliff Sterns' primary function is related to oversight and review follow-up.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: gruhastha balashakthi ha wanija kamituva** (household power and commercial activity) - These are *areas* Sterns oversees, not his *primary function*.
*   **B: komen padanama** (mentioned name) - This is irrelevant to the question.
*   **C: saelasumgatha demapiyabhawaya** (relevant dempiyabhawaya) - This is a general term related to the discussions, not Sterns' specific role.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, swis kanthavata sidu nowuye kumakda?","The correct answer is **D: aege durakathanaya saha laeptop pariganakaya soraagena aetha** (they stole his phone and laptop).

Here's why:

The text states: """"swiss kaantava kelesu dushakayan pas deneku api ath adabguvata gene aethi athara, aeyage durakathanaya saha laeptop pariganakaya soyagena tibenava"""" which translates to ""After the incident with the Swiss national, within five days we arrested them, and recovered his phone and laptop.""

Therefore, the Swiss national was robbed of his phone and laptop.



"
2007 dee thayiwan thirasara sammanayen pidum laebuwe kumana samaagamada?,"The correct answer is **C: aasus**.

Here's why:

The text (P) explicitly states: ""...lada aesus ee peesee pariganakaya, 2007 thaipe toraturu thaaksana maasayehi vadaat unusum matrukavak viya.""  This translates to ""...Asus PC was introduced in October 2007.""

The question (Q) asks which company received the ""thirasara sammanaya"" (best award) in 2007.  Since the text states Asus introduced a PC in 2007, it's reasonable to infer that Asus is the company being referred to as receiving the award.



"
aasus ee peesee yanu kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: laeptop pariganakayak** (laptop computer).

Here's why:

The text (P) explicitly states: ""...*pasuwa laeptop pariganakavala paaribhogika weledapola daedi vichalanayakata saha venasvimakata lakwanu aetha*.""  This translates to ""...especially for commercial use, speed and reliability, this laptop computer was chosen.""

Therefore, the passage clearly identifies ""aasus ee peesee"" as a laptop computer.



"
athurudan wu thaepael lekhanawalata wagakiwa yuththe kawuda?,"The correct answer is **C: pirimi lamayek** (a female employee).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ek pirimi lamayeku, aluth avurudu suba paetum path 429 k aetuluva, thaepael lekhana 600 kata wadi pramaanayak sangavaa aethi bawath eva adaala pudgalayanta nolaeby aethi bawath soyaa gaenimen pasuwa...""  This directly translates to: ""A female employee, worth 429k, was found to be sending a certificate of 600 words regarding New Year wishes to individuals...""

The question asks *who* was involved with the postal writing. The passage clearly identifies a female employee.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: thaepael sewakayin** (postal worker) - While she *works* for the postal service, the passage specifically identifies her as a female *employee*, not just a general worker.
* **B: obanaasawa nevasikayan pirisak** (resident of the area) - The passage doesn't indicate this person is a resident, just an employee.
* **D: maadhyaya** (middleman) - This isn't mentioned in the text at all.



"
"memama chedayata anuwa, athurudahan wu liyakiyavili sambandhayen kanagatuwa pala kara sitiye kawuda?","The correct answer is **D: obanaasawa thaepael kaaryaalaya** (Department of Census and Statistics).

Here's why:

The passage states the letter is *sent to* the ""obanasaava thaepael kaaryaalayata paeminili karannata patangat vitaya"" (sent to the Department of Census and Statistics). The question asks what the letter is about in relation to the information provided.  The passage details a census conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics, starting January 1st.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: pradesheeya nevasikayan** (Regional population) - This is *what* is being counted, not the recipient of the letter.
*   **B: pirimi lamaya** (a certain person) - This refers to the person who wrote the letter and the amount they received, but not the central topic of the letter itself.
*   **C: maadhyaya** (medium/media) - The mention of media is just a detail about how the census information was disseminated, not the core subject.



"
del potrota ohuge urahis gaetaluwa visandeemata awashya wuye kawadada?,"The correct answer is **A: palamu set wataya atharathura** (the first set was crucial).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""palamu set vataya mare paraajaya viya"" (losing the first set meant defeat).  It then explains that even if Del Potro fought back, 6-6, he *needed* to win the first set to have a chance.  Therefore, the importance of the first set is directly highlighted as a critical factor in determining the outcome.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: palamu samana lakunu gaeneeme waarayata pera** (after reaching a tie in the first set) - The passage emphasizes needing to *win* the first set, not just tie it.
* **C: dewana set wataya atharathura** (the second set was crucial) - The passage focuses entirely on the first set's importance.
* **D: thewana samana lakunu gaeneeme waarayata pasuwa** (being able to reach a tie in the third set) - The passage doesn't mention the third set at all.



"
palamu samana lakunu gaeneeme waaraye prathiphalaya kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: palamu set waaraye mure paraajayata pathviya** (the first set lost and faced defeat).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""palamu set vataya mare paraajaya viya"" which directly translates to ""the first set lost and faced defeat.""  The question asks about the result of the first equal score. The passage links the first set losing to that equal score.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: thuwala weemen pasu del potro paraajayata pathviya** (Dell lost after being pushed to a tiebreak) - While Dell is mentioned, this isn't the direct result of the first equal score.
* **C: dewana set waaraye mure paraajayata pathviya** (the second set lost and faced defeat) - The passage specifically refers to the *first* set.
* **D: dewana set waaraye del potro jayagrahanaya kaleya** (Dell won the second set) - This isn't stated in the passage.



"
"mema chedaye sandahan kara aethi paridi, visheshayen rogiyekuta niraawaranaya wuye kawuda?","The correct answer is **A: aandukarawaraya** (the suspect).

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states the suspect said:** """"ada apata danagannata laebune samahara paasal vayase daruvan rogiya samaga sambandhatha pavatvaa aethi bavata handunaagena aethi"""" - ""that he was accused of having connections with several school-aged children patients.""  This clearly points to the suspect being the one connected to the patients/potentially involved with the issue of harming children.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: daruwan (children):** The passage mentions children as *victims* or those the suspect is accused of interacting with, but they aren't the ones being investigated or making the statements.
* **C: teksas niladhaareen (Texas holders/landowners):** This refers to the people the suspect allegedly cheated, not the ones involved in the accusations of harm.
* **D: pradesheeya nevaasikayin (regional residents):** This is too broad a category. The passage focuses on a specific accusation and the suspect's connection to *children patients*.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, teksas vaesiyan aematheemedee aandukarawaraya laba nodun sahathikaya kumakda?","The correct answer is **D: mema siduweema barapathala nowe** (This situation is not a cover-up).

Here's why:

The passage states the accused says, """"mema siduweema barapathalayi. apage kriya piliwela kriyaatmaka wana bavatat, viya yuthu bavatat sahatikayi"""" (This situation is not a cover-up. Our actions will be proactive, and we will be cooperative).  Therefore, option D directly reflects his statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mema kriya piliwela hondin kriyathmaka we** (This action is very proactive) - While he *says* their actions will be proactive, this isn't the direct answer to the question about the cover-up.
* **B: mahajana aarakkshaa thahawuru kirima sandaha awashya piyawara ganimin sitee** (Public safety is a necessary priority) - This is mentioned in the initial statement, but doesn't address the core of what the accused is claiming about a cover-up.
* **C: abhiyogayata muhuna deeme haekiyawa owunta aetha** (We are facing accusations) - Again, true, but doesn't answer the question about a cover-up.



"
hitapu UW shish‍yayan dedenek visin nirmanaya karana lada prawurththi hasakanukarana moolaash‍raya kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: da kolbat ripot** (The Colbert Report).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Da deily sho saha da kolbert report valata boho kalakata pera, heck saha jonsan ovun uw hi sishyayanva sity 1988 vasare..."" This translates to ""Both The Daily Show and The Colbert Report greatly influenced how Heck and Johnson approached their student work starting in 1988...""

The question asks about the origin of comedic influence on student work. The text explicitly identifies *The Colbert Report* (along with *The Daily Show*) as a key source of that influence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: chanda vid‍yalaya (Chanda Vidyaalaya - Chandar school):** While mentioned in the context of a story about Al Gore, it's a detail *within* a comedic story, not the source of the comedic style.
*   **C: da deli sho (The Daily Show):** While also mentioned as an influence, the question is looking for *the* foundational influence, and the passage emphasizes both shows equally. *The Colbert Report* is a direct answer to the question about comedic style for student work.
*   **D: da aniyan (The Onion):** *The Onion* is mentioned as a source of news, but not as a direct comedic inspiration for Heck and Johnson's student work.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, da aniyan prawurththi hasakanukarana adhiraajyayata aethulath kara nomaeththe mewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: web adaviyak**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...oktober maasa thula pudgalayan 5,000,000 k naerambu web adaviyak..."" This translates to ""...in October, a massive 5,000,000 strong web presence..."".  The passage then continues to say this contributes to the rise of a comedic empire (""puwath haasanukarana adhiraajyayak"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: loka sithiyamak (global system):** While the comedic empire *reaches* globally, the passage doesn't say the system itself *is* the empire.
* **B: chithrapatayak (movie):** The passage doesn't mention movies.
* **D: mud‍ritha sanskaranayak (printed version):** The passage mentions printing (""mudrana""), but it's a part of the larger push, not the core driver of the empire. The web presence is described as being significantly larger (5,000,000).



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, polisiya visin aarakshaa karana ladade kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: dawnin weediye pivisuma (Downing Street entrance)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...agamaetige nila nivasa pihiti downin vidiyata wana polis aarakshava sahitha pivisumata prativiruddha paette vayit hol hidi udghoshanaya aarambha viya.""  This translates to ""A protest began against entering Downing Street with police security.""

Therefore, the police were securing the entrance to Downing Street. The other options are locations the protestors *moved towards* after the initial protest started, not where the police were initially providing security.



"
thawaduratath maarga thadabadaya walakwa gaeneema sandaha polisiya virodhathakaruwangen iwathwa yana lesa illaa sitiye kumana welaaweda?,"The correct answer is **D: 11:20 ta**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""11:20 ta polisiya virodhataakaruvangen illaa sitiye padika vedikaavata aapasu yana lesayi.""  This translates to ""At 11:20, the police began to move towards the platform where the protestors were, without any opposition.""  This indicates the police moved *without* facing resistance at 11:20.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 11:00 ta pamana** - This is when the protest *started*, not when the police moved without resistance.
*   **B: 11:29 ta** - This is when the route the protestors took is described, not when the police moved without resistance.
*   **C: 11:00 pera** - This is too vague; the text specifies a precise time.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Anekuth visheshagnayan samaharak denaa menma, ohuda diyavaediyaava suva kireeme haekiyaawa pilibandava saeka pahala karanne, 1 aakaraye diyavaediyaava daenatamat pavathna pudgalayan sambandhayen mema soyaagaeneem kisindu adaalatvayak nodakvana bhava satahan karamini.""  This translates to: ""Having collected a lot of specialized data, he initially looked at whether religious experience was good, and this legal case regarding individuals connecting to the first religious experience began.""

This clearly indicates the initial focus of Ehud Ur's research was on the *benefits* of the first religious experience for patients.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The text doesn't suggest the research was about preventing religious experiences.
* **C:** The text doesn't portray a positive outcome (subhawadee) regarding the legal case, only that it *began*.
* **D:** The research started by looking at the benefits, not whether to stop religious experiences.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...1 aakaraye diyavaediyaava daenatamat pavathna pudgalayan sambandhayen mema soyaagaeneem kisindu adaalatvayak nodakvana bhava satahan karamini.""  This translates to ""...she was starting to look into this case involving the relationship between the 1st accused and the individuals.""

Question Q asks what Professor Ur is investigating.  Option A directly reflects this investigation – looking into the case with the 1st accused and the individuals involved.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: prathikarayak viya haekida yana bawa** (being a retaliator) - The passage doesn't mention anything about retaliators.
*   **C: prathikarayak sambandhayen wenath visheshangayange mathaya kumak weda yanna** (what to know about opinions regarding a retaliator) - Similar to B, no mention of retaliators.
*   **D: diyawaediyawa nomaethi meeyan digatama elesa pawathee da yanna** (that the accused will be released) - The passage doesn't talk about a potential release.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Anaturata lakvu sthaanaya ada soyaganna lada athara, ema sthaanayata langaavima kotaram apahasu vuvada yat, ema sthaanayata payie gos diwi galava gath aya seveema sandaha polis niladhaarin dedeneku wanantharaya tulata godabaswana ladi.""  This translates to: ""The area where the aircraft crashed was cordoned off, and police officers were sent to investigate the area, as there was a risk of debris falling from the area.""  Crucially, it states the area was *marked* because of the crash.
* **Option D directly reflects this:** ""guvan yaanaya anathurata lak wu sthaanaya seweema ayahapath kaalagunaya nisa balapaemata lak viya"" translates to ""The area where the aircraft crashed was marked due to investigative time.""  It correctly identifies the reason for marking the area: the crash and subsequent investigation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** ""guvan yaanaya mula dee ayahapath kaalagunaya nisa godabaemata nohaeki viya"" - This talks about not being able to approach due to investigative time, but doesn't address *why* the area was initially marked.
* **B:** ""yaanaya itha dura baehaera sthaanayaka kadaa waetuni"" -  Asks when the aircraft moved from a distant location, which isn't in the passage.
* **C:** ""guvan yaanaya kadaa waeteemata pera thun wathawak godabaemata uthsaha kaleya"" - Asks about taking efforts to reach the aircraft after it landed, which isn't the focus of the passage.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage."
CG4684 yaanaya godabaema awalangu kirimata hethuwa kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: godabaeme sthaanayata prawesha viya nohaeki viya** (Because it was unable to enter the landing site).

Here's why:

The passage states the Twin Otter (CG4684) was attempting to land at Kokoda, but ""unable to land due to unfavorable winds."" It then describes the difficulties and dangers of attempting to land in that location.  Therefore, the reason for the aborted landing was the inability to access the landing site.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: CG4684 yaanayata idiriyen thawath guvan yanaa kihipayak thibuni** (There were problems with the Twin Otter's engine) - The passage doesn't mention any engine problems.
* **C: yaanaya kokodaa wetha naewatha harawa yawana ladee** (The plane was lost because it didn't arrive at Kokoda) - The plane wasn't *lost*, it just couldn't land.
* **D: kalagunika thaththwaya ayahapath viya** (Time constraints were a factor) - While time is mentioned, it's not the primary reason for the aborted landing.  The winds are the core issue.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""... minisun pitatata paeminimata janel kaedimata uthsaaha karana..."" (someone trying to tie the window with a rope...) and ""... avasaanaye ek janel piyanak kaedee, ema piyanen ivathata emata ovun patan gattoya,"" (...finally, one window was tied with a rope, with that rope they descended).
* This clearly indicates the person *successfully* tied the window with a rope.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: awasanaye ohu nirupad‍rithawa sitiyeya** (finally he was disillusioned) - The passage doesn't mention any disillusionment.
* **C: pitathata yaamata uthsaha karana atharathura ohu putuwak kadaa daemeeya** (despite trying to tie the window, he couldn't tie it) - The passage describes a successful attempt to tie the window.
* **D: janelayak kaedeemata uthsaha karamin sitiyadee ohu thuwala laebeeya** (while trying to tie the window, he fell) - The passage doesn't mention anyone falling.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Jaathika kunaatu madyasthaanaye vidyagnayan purokathanaya karana paridi badaadaa wana vita daniyel, kunatuvak dakva dakva prabala vanu aetha.""  This directly translates to ""Daniel, while conducting investigations for the national mediation center's knowledge-based program, was said to be very strong in his opinions.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage doesn't discuss whether the investigation definitively proved anything about the whole situation.
* **C:**  The passage doesn't mention any accusations of corruption or hardship.
* **D:** While Miami is mentioned, the passage doesn't state Daniel was far away from it during hardship.



Therefore, option A is the only one directly supported by the text."

This translates to: ""It wasn't strong enough to reach even the nearby islands, let alone the Caribbean.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: eya athlaanthik sagaraye nirmanaya viya** (It was the formation of the Atlantic Ocean) - The passage doesn't support this. It describes a storm *within* the Atlantic, not the creation of the ocean itself.
* **C: eya suli kunaatuvak bawata path viya haekiya** (It was a storm that crossed the land) - The passage emphasizes the storm's power over the ocean, not land.
* **D: eka godabimata aasannawa pawathee** (It was about to hit a cloud) - This is irrelevant and not mentioned in the passage.

This translates to: ""It is said that studies show this could lead to a deadly outcome if the disease spreads through close contact, especially during the rainy season.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: roga lakshana mrudu viya yuthuya** (it will lead to mild symptoms) - The passage doesn't suggest mild symptoms; it warns of a potentially *deadly* outcome.
* **C: waedi pirisak aasadanaya viya yuthuya** (it will lead to easy spread) - While spread is mentioned, the focus is on the *severity* of the outcome, not just the ease of spread.
* **D: daruwanta roga lakshana aethi viya yuthuya** (it will lead to drug-resistant symptoms) - The passage doesn't discuss drug resistance.



Therefore, option A accurately reflects the warning presented in the passage."
"mema chedayata anuwa, suli kunaatuva fujiyan sita kopamana durakin thibuneda?","The question asks for the distance from Agosthu (August) 9th's nighttime location to Fujian, China. The passage states the location is ""kilo meetar haettaevak pamana baehaerava moracot hi kendhraya paewathina"" and is 9 kilometers away on the night of August 9th.  The question asks how far Fujian is *from* that location.

Therefore, the answer is **A: kilo meetara 9**.

jorj dabliw bush aasiyawata paemini vita ohuwa piligaththe kawuda?,"The correct answer is **D: niyojya agamaethi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ohuva singappuruve **niyojya agamaeti** wong kann sen piligat athara..."" which translates to ""He arrived in Singapore as a **designated representative** with Wong Kan Seng...""

The question asks *how* George Dubya Bush arrived in Asia. The passage directly states he arrived in Singapore as a designated representative.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: agamaethi (arrived)** - This is just a verb meaning 'arrived,' not *how* he arrived (his role/capacity).
*   **B: prekshakayek (spectator)** - The passage doesn't mention him being a spectator.
*   **C: vong kan seng saha lee sen loong (Wong Kan Seng and Lee Sen Loong)** - These are people he met with, not *how* he arrived.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Madya kaaleena maetivarana paraajayen satiyakata pasu, bush aasiyave velanda vyaaptiya pilibandava shraavakayanta paewasee ya.""  This directly translates to ""Following his midterm election defeat, Bush spoke to listeners about Asia's expansion.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ohu singappooruwata paemini vita** (he traveled to Singapore) - While he *did* travel to Singapore, the question is about when he spoke about Asia's expansion.
* **B: vong kan seng samaga** (with Wong Kan Seng) -  He met with Wong Kan Seng, but that's not related to *when* he talked about the expansion.
* **D: ohuge sathiyaka aasiyanu sanchaaraya atharathura** (at the beginning of his Asian tour) - The passage mentions the start of his Asian tour (November 16th), but doesn't link *when* he spoke about expansion to the beginning of the tour.  It links it to his election defeat.

"mema chedayata anuwa, rajaye samastha ilakkaya wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: mema wasare marthu masaya wana vita thawath maediri sandaha aramudal saepayeema** (This year, due to the March month harvest, the income from the initial seed capital increased).

Here's why:

* **The question (Q) asks about the overall impact on the country's income.**  The passage states that the good harvest in March led to increased income from the seed capital.  This directly relates to the country's overall economic situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: mulu maediri 300 k laba gaeneema** (Income of 300k from seeds) - This is a specific detail, not the overall national impact.
* **C: amathara maediri 1,300 k laba gaeneema** (Income of 1,300k from harvest) -  Similarly, this is a specific number, not the broad effect on the country.
* **D: maediri senagin piree ithiree yama samanaya kirima** (Doing many things related to seed management) - This is about agricultural *practices*, not income or national impact.

The passage emphasizes the *increase in income* due to the harvest, making option A the most accurate answer to the question."

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Ada dina nivedanaya magin amathara maediri sandaha aramudal saepayima sandaha...""  This translates to ""Today's statement was made by officials of the Department of Treasury.""  It then specifies that this department handled 300k.
* **Option A** directly reflects this: ""officials of the Department of Treasury handling 300k...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** Mentions a site, not the originator of the statement.
* **C:**  Refers to 1,300k, a different number than mentioned in connection with the statement's origin.
* **D:** Talks about a future event, not the making of the current statement.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, dannaa thorathuru wanne monawada?","Let's break down the original statement (P) and the question (Q) to determine the correct answer.

**Understanding P:**

The statement (P) is quite complex, but essentially says: ""It seems that people who expect miracles don't have wisdom.  Even if they get a little bit of what they want, it doesn't feel complete or meaningful.""  It suggests a lack of fulfillment even *with* some success when it's based on unrealistic expectations.  It criticizes relying on miracles.

**Understanding Q:**

The question (Q) asks: ""Following this line of thought, does it suggest that seeking blessings is bad?""  (A more literal translation is ""Following this statement, does it mean seeking blessings is a waste?"")

**Analyzing the Options:**

* **A: tharjana mattama adu wee aetha (Even a little blessing is enough)** - This directly *contradicts* the sentiment of P.  P implies even small gains are unsatisfying if based on expecting miracles.
* **B: thawaduratath tharjanayak nomaetha (Seeking blessings is not bad)** - While not *directly* stated, it's the closest fit. The statement isn't saying *all* seeking of good things is bad, just that expecting miracles is problematic. You can seek blessings, just don't rely on them unrealistically.
* **C: prahaarayak apekshaa kere (Expecting miracles)** - P *criticizes* expecting miracles, it doesn't suggest to continue doing so.
* **D: prahaaraya darunu wanu aethi bawata buddhi ansha thahawuru kara aetha (Makes people with wisdom feel bad about difficulties)** - This doesn't directly relate to the question of whether seeking blessings is bad.

**Conclusion:**

The best answer is **B: thawaduratath tharjanayak nomaetha (Seeking blessings is not bad)**.  The original statement criticizes the *expectation of miracles*, not the desire for positive outcomes or the act of seeking blessings itself.

virodhathaavaya pilibanda sathya nowana prakaashaya kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: janaadhipathi komisama virodhathaavalata prathichaarayak viya** (The presidential commission was a pretext for opposition).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ema komisama oktober maasaye dee paalakayinta viruddhava vyaaptava aethi woo virodhataavalata maartelige prathicharaya viya.""  This directly translates to: ""That commission was a pretext for opposition against the president in October.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: kal giya maethivarana nisa virodhatha avuuwanu laebeeya** (Opposition was allowed to arise due to the past election) - While the election is mentioned, the passage doesn't say it *caused* the opposition.
* **C: virodhatha magin pera see. ee. pee. sabhawa illaa asviya yuthu bawa illaa sitina ladee** (Opposition was not in the parliament or any other official forum) - The passage doesn't specifically address where the opposition took place.
* **D: virodhatha samahara vitaka prachandakaree viya** (Opposition was highly controversial) - This is true, but it doesn't answer *what the opposition was about* or *why it arose* as the question asks.  It's a characteristic *of* the opposition, not the source.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Eya vasara hatarak thula maatelige pasvaeni cep eka we."" (It was a CEP working behind the scenes).  It also describes the CEP initiating a package of proposals regarding new electoral methods.
* **The question asks:** Who planned the scheme to influence the election?
* **Option D** directly links the CEP (see. ee. pee. sabhawe) to initiating the plan to influence society (saamaajikayin visinma meya yojanaa karana ladee).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: martelli (Martelli):**  Martelli isn't mentioned as a planner.
* **B: virodhathakaruwan (Opponents):** The passage describes opponents *reacting* to the plan, not *creating* it.
* **C: janaadhipath komisama (People's Democratic Commission):** The commission was involved in reviewing proposals, but didn't initiate the plan.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the need to ""ප්‍රවර්ධනය කිරීma sandaha olympik pavule parama awashyathaavaya piligani"" (prioritize enhancing the environment for our athletes) and emphasizes creating a ""aarakshitha, saadhaniya saha savi bala gaenvu parisarayak"" (safe, suitable and powerful environment).  The entire argument revolves around supporting gymnasts by improving their training and competitive conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sahathikaya naethi kirima** (not prioritizing cooperation) - The passage doesn't focus on lack of cooperation.
* **C: sanvidhaanaya thula awashya wenaskam** (essential constitutional requirements) - While the constitution is mentioned, it's not the main focus of the passage.
* **D: swadheena vimarshanayak** (independent review) -  Independent review is mentioned in relation to specific applications, but isn't the overarching concern.

Here's why:

The passage repeatedly emphasizes the need to protect athletes (kridaka kridikaavanta) and create a safe environment (aarakshitha parisarayak pravardhanaya) within USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic Committee. It mentions issues of abuse and the importance of prioritizing athlete well-being.  This is the central concern driving the call for change and independent review.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: laeree nasarge apayojanaya helidaraw kirima** (doing what Larry Nassar did) - This is the *problem* the passage is addressing, not the goal.
* **B: sahathikaya naethi kirimata katayuthu kirima** (fighting against cooperation) - The passage doesn't focus on hindering collaboration.
* **C: pawudgalika vimarshanayak sandaha katayuthu kirima** (fighting against individual review) - The text *calls for* independent review (svaadhina vimarsanaya), not against it.



"
anathura siduwana vita yaathrawa gaman karamin sitiye koheda? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palaawan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Eya e.ja. naavika hamudaave hatveni naavika bala aeniyata pavara aethi athara, **japaanaye naagasaakihi sasebohi pihita aetha.**"" which translates to ""It was en route to the naval base after leaving the US Naval Forces, stopping at Nagasaki and Sasebo in Japan."" and ""Aevengar khaandaye bim bomba prathiprahaara yaatravak, yaatrava palavaan hi poto prinsesa wetha yamin tibina."" which translates to ""The Avenger-class bomb disposal ship, Princess was heading towards Palawan.""

Therefore, the journey was headed towards **Palawan**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**Aevengar khaandaye bim bomba prathiprahaara yaatravak...**"" which translates to ""Concerning the Khande area, a B-29 bomber retaliatory journey...""  This directly identifies the journey as a retaliatory mission involving a B-29 bomber.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eya puwarto prinsesa wetha yana gamane thibeeya** (it stopped at Princess Weth's going place/destination) - While Princess Weth is mentioned, it doesn't define the *nature* of the journey.
* **B: eya palaawan hi pihita aetha** (it is stationed in Palawan) - Palawan is mentioned as a place the journey passed *over*, not where it was stationed.
* **D: eya eksath janapada naavika hamudawe hathwana balaaeniya wetha pawara aetha** (it is a power related to the combined fleet naval forces) - The journey is linked to naval forces, but it *is* the journey itself – a bombing mission - not a power relating to the fleet.

This translates to: ""Last night, US President **Donald Trump** released a statement regarding the US position on a matter through the media.""

The question asks *who* released the statement. The text directly identifies Donald Trump as the source.

Following this, it explicitly states the fighters will be sent *back to their countries*, and earlier in the text it is discussed that Donald Trump is discussing this issue with Turkey's president. Therefore, the country being referenced as the destination for these fighters is **Syria**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: yuropaya (Europe):** The text specifically states Europe *rejected* taking them back.
*   **C: eksath janapadaya (United States):** While Trump is involved, the text doesn't indicate the US is taking them.
*   **D: thurkiya (Turkey):** Turkey is involved in *holding* them, not necessarily the final destination.

kadaa waeteemata hethuwa lesa vishwaasa karanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: katuka bhoomi pradeshaya** (bitter land area).

This translates to: ""...they had faith because of the enemy attacks and defenses. They searched and offered gifts in uninhabited places, especially in the **bitter land area** along with the difficult passage."" 

The passage directly links faith being established to the ""katuka bhoomi pradeshaya"".  The other options are mentioned in the passage, but aren't directly tied to the reason for faith/trust.



"
anathura sidu wuye kumana aakaraye bhoomi pradeshayaka da?,"The correct answer is **B: katuka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ayahapath kaalagunaya saha **katuka bhoomi pradaesha** hamuve anaratura sidu woo sthaanaya soya sodhisi maehaeyum diyath karamin pawathee.""  This directly translates to ""They are searching for places in the difficult/bitter land area."" 

Therefore, ""anathura sidu wuye"" (the land area being referred to) is **katuka** (difficult/bitter).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sathuru** - This isn't mentioned in relation to the area being searched.
*   **C: sandhaana** - This refers to Sandhana Pradeshaya, the region as a whole, not a specific type of land within it.
*   **D: kandukara** - This refers to a border area, but not the difficult terrain being searched.



"
ganwathure prathiphalayak lesa niladhaareen apekshaa karanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: waeli baemma yathaawath kirima** (building a dam/embankment appropriately).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ganvaturin pasu adi kihipayak pamanak jala mattama ihala naenvunada, ganga pahala khaedanayata lak woo vaelipara yathaevath kirimata eya pramaenavat wei kiyae niladhearin apekshaa karathi.""  This translates to: ""The villagers, fearing a great flood, expected to build an embankment appropriately like the one on the other side of the river, to protect the area below the river.""

Therefore, the villagers are expecting the construction of an embankment (waeli baemma) to prevent flooding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: werala nirmanaya kirima** (building a temple) - The passage doesn't mention anything about building a temple.
* **C: hampbaek paetawun waedi pramaanayak** (measuring the area where fish spawn) - While fish are mentioned, the expectation isn't about *measuring* their spawning area.
* **D: thawath wanajiwee waasasthaana** (habitat for wildlife) -  The passage focuses on protecting the village from the river, not specifically creating wildlife habitats.



"
wella idikirimata sthirawama balapaewe pahatha sandahan karunu atharin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: waelipara**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ganga pahala khaedanayata lak woo vaelipara yathaevath kirimata eya pramaenavat wei kiyae niladhearin apekshaa karathi.""  This translates to ""it expects to be considered equal to the sand in the riverbed, like the *waelipara* for river erosion.""  This directly links *waelipara* to stability and being weighed down/settled.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: hampbaek paetawun (Humpback petrels):** The passage mentions them, but not in relation to stability or being weighed down. They are described as arriving and causing excitement.
* **C: wanajiwee waasasthaana (Forest dwelling place):** The passage describes the forest, but doesn't connect it to stability.
* **D: awasaaditha paethuruwa (Flooded land):** While related to the river, it doesn't describe something weighing down or stabilizing.



Therefore, **waelipara** is the only option directly tied to the idea of stability in relation to the riverbed, as described in the passage."
"mema chedayata anuwa, eksath janapadayata siduviya haeki prahaara gaena thorathuru laba dunne kawuda?","The correct answer is **A: somaliyanu anthawadeen** (Somali extremists).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) clearly states:** ""Somaaliyaavae anthavaadihu..."" (Somali extremists...) are carrying out attacks in Kenya and Ethiopia.  It identifies them as the source of the bombings.
* **The question (Q) asks:** Who is receiving threats and carrying out attacks against the unified people?
* **Therefore:** The Somali extremists are the ones *carrying out* the attacks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ithiyopiyanu thanaapathi kaaryaalaya** (Ethiopian presidential office) - The passage mentions attacks *in* Ethiopia, but the office isn't the perpetrator.
* **C: anaawaranaya nokala moolaash‍rayak** (Unidentified hideouts) - These are *where* the extremists are hiding, not *who* is carrying out the attacks.
* **D: kenyawe moolaash‍rayak** (Kenyan hideouts) -  Similar to C, these are locations, not the actors.

Here's why:

* **P's text describes bombings in Somalia, Kenya, and Ethiopia.** It mentions a coordinated attack, suggesting multiple locations.
* **Q asks about the *details* of the attack, specifically where the explosives were detonated.**
* **Option C** directly addresses this, stating that bombs were detonated in *several places* using explosives (bim salakunu wala bomba pupuruwa haereema).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ek rataka bim salakunu wala bomba pupuruwa haereema** (bombs detonated with explosives in one place) -  The text implies multiple locations.
* **B: ratawal dekaka bomba pupurawa haereema** (bombs detonated in several places) - This is close, but doesn't mention the use of explosives.
* **D: ek rataka bomba pupurawa haereema** (bombs detonated in one place) - Incorrect, as the text suggests a coordinated, multi-location attack.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate and detailed answer based on the information provided in text P."

This translates to ""...Many influential people, including...solicitors and notaries, were involved in covering up actions that violated ethics and led to the disrepute of the Greek legal community...""

Therefore, ""solisitarwarun"" (solicitors) are directly identified as contributing to the disrepute of the Greek legal community.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: vinisuruwarun** (influential people) - This is a broader category, not the specific profession identified with the disrepute.
*   **C: maadhyawedeen** (media personnel) - The passage mentions media, but links them to *reporting* on the scandal, not *causing* it.
*   **D: neetheengayin** (judges) - While implied to be affected, judges aren't directly stated as *causing* the disrepute in this section.

Therefore, the number of runs scored by India is 7."
"mema chedayata anuwa, inime waedima lakunu pramaanaya wuye kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: lakunu 70**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...pandu 41 ta lakunu 70 ki."" This directly translates to ""with 41 runs and 70 wickets.""  The question asks for the number of wickets taken, which is 70.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: lakunu 36** - This is the number of balls bowled, not wickets.
*   **C: lakunu 100** - This number doesn't appear in the passage.
*   **D: lakunu 41** - This is the number of runs scored, not wickets.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P)** heavily focuses on a planned council meeting concerning a situation involving ""vikinivus wetha kathaa"" (a story about a forest) and ""lingika anthargathaya sambandhava"" (sexual relationships). The speaker expresses concern and feels betrayed (""boru kiveya"") and suspects the meeting is about addressing these relationships.  The passage culminates in the idea that the investigation is driven by *this* content.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: wels visin kalaa krutheen maka daemeema** (seeing artistic creations from Wels) - While mentioned, this is a *result* of something, not the reason for the meeting.
* **C: welsaya aehumkan nodeema** (Wels not giving permission) -  This is a minor point and doesn't explain the overall concern and investigation.
* **D: kalaa krutheen makadaemeemata hethuwa pilibanda wu boru** (a lie about the reason for the artistic creations) - The passage suggests the reason itself is the problem, not a lie *about* the reason.



**Therefore, option A directly addresses the central theme and driving force behind the described situation – the investigation into sexual content discovered in the forest.**"
"mema chedayata anuwa, web adaviyen maka damanu laebuwe kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: kalaa krutheen** (art works).

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""...ohuge kalaa kruthi makaademima dakvaa."" which translates to ""...see his artworks.""  The question (Q) asks what was seen in the web.  Therefore, the answer is the artworks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: lingika anthargathaya** (sexual intimacy) - While mentioned in the passage, it's not what was *seen* on the web.
* **C: prathipaththi ketumpathak** (response path) - This refers to a way of reacting and isn't something visible on the web.
* **D: pudgalika-himikarithwaya himi madhya** (individual-foolishness in the middle of ice) - This doesn't make sense in the context of the passage or the question.

The text states: ""Thama adahas kese vuvada 2012 london hi pawathwena olympic ulalae brithaanya tharagakaruvanta sahaya dakwana bhava ohu prakaasha kalaeya.""  This translates to ""He revealed himself as helping British athletes at the 2012 London Olympics.""

Therefore, the passage identifies Amir Khan as someone who helped British athletes. The question asks what Amir Khan is identified as in the passage.

Here's why:

The passage (P) describes Amir Khan as someone who ""lives amongst the forest dwellers"" (""kantha nilayan aethulath kirimata siyallanma sahaya nodaekvi ya"").  The question (Q) asks *who* Amir Khan is associated with, based on the passage.  The passage directly identifies him with the forest dwellers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 2004 olimpik ulele sesu tharagakaruwan (2004 Olympic sprinting champion):** While the passage *mentions* he won a 2004 Olympic medal, it doesn't define him *as* the sprinting champion; it's just a detail about him.

*   **D: anekuth ridee padakkamlaabheen (multiple Olympic medal winner):**  Again, it's a detail *about* him, not his defining characteristic *within the context of this passage*.

The passage states: ""Siya tharagayata pera vatayae dee, lens ohugae yathuru paediyaen vaetunu athara..."" which translates to ""He went with his racing team, and Lens went with him on the racing car...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ohuge baisikalayen waeteemen pasu** (he went by bicycle) - The passage mentions a *racing car* (yathuru paediyaen) not a bicycle.
*   **C: rohale dee** (he went to the hospital) - While he *ended up* at a medical facility at the race track, the initial statement says he went with the team.
*   **D: dhaawana pathaye vaid‍ya karya mandalaya samaga sitiya dee** (he stayed with the race track's medical facility) - He visited the medical facility *after* the incident, not as his initial destination.



"
seviyar sayat yanu kawuda?,"The correct answer is **A: dhaawana pathaye vaid‍ya karya mandalaya** (the medical facility of the race track).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dhaawana pathaye vaidya kaarya mandalaya visin vahaama ohuta prathikara kara ohu praadeshiya rohalakata raegena giya athara pasuwa ohu ehidee miya giyae ya.""  This translates to: ""He was taken to the medical facility of the race track for treatment, and after being cleared by the regional doctor, he was allowed to go home.""

The question asks where Seviyar was taken. The text *directly* answers this – to the medical facility of the race track.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: wenath tharagakaruweku** (with the other racers) - While he was racing, the text doesn't say he was taken *with* the other racers.
*   **C: vaid‍yawarayeku** (a doctor) - He was treated *by* a doctor, but not taken *to* a doctor as a place.
*   **D: prekshakayeku** (a spectator) - There's no indication he was taken to a spectator.

guvan yaanayaka abhyanthara kriyakarithwaya therum gaeneemen kanassallata pathwa sitina guvan niyamuwekuta prayojana gatha haekke kumana thathwayakadee da?,"The passage describes a situation where someone feels ashamed and vulnerable after being unexpectedly seen while defecating (guvan yaana). It highlights the fear of being judged, the embarrassment, and the desire to understand the rules and expectations surrounding this natural act to avoid future incidents.

The question asks about what would help someone overcome their embarrassment regarding this internal process and follow appropriate ""guvan niyamuwek"" (rules of defecation).

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: magiya owunge biya gaena laejja wanne nam** (If you are not ashamed of your actions) - This is a philosophical statement and doesn't address the *how* of following rules or reducing embarrassment in this specific situation.
* **B: piyasara kirimata aethi akamaeththa kend‍ragatha wee aeththe nodannaa de ha sambandha bheethiyak wata nam** (If you are not worried about others seeing you while urinating and are not afraid of the fear of connection) - This addresses a different bodily function (urination) and still focuses on fear, not understanding rules.
* **C: magiya siyaluma prawaahanaya wargawalata akamaethi nam** (If you are not ashamed of the flow of your excrement to the class) - This is a strange and unhelpful phrasing that doesn't relate to the question.
* **D: owunge kanassalla paena naginne piyasara kirima ha sambandha nowana wenath kampana sahagatha siduweemakin nam** (If you are not afraid of the shaking that comes with not being able to urinate and associate it with your surroundings) -  Again, this discusses a different bodily function (urination) and focuses on physical symptoms of anxiety, not rules or reducing embarrassment.

None of the options directly address the need to *understand the rules* to avoid embarrassment. However, **option B** is the *closest* in spirit. The core of the passage's concern is avoiding being seen and the associated fear and shame.  While it mentions urination, the sentiment of not being concerned about observation and the associated fear is relevant.

Therefore, the best answer, although imperfect, is **B**.

"mema chedayata anuwa, mila kerehi awadhaanaya yomu karana sanchaarakayeku awadhaaranaya kala yuththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: bahu sanchaaraka sewaawan athara mila sansandanaya karanna** (to coordinate with multiple telecom service providers regarding connection).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** discusses a problem with connectivity (poor signal, dropped calls) and the need to investigate and rectify it. It mentions checking connections and possibly conducting tests.  The core issue is a *connection* problem.
* **Q (the question)** asks what a supervisor would do, given this situation.  
* **Option C** directly addresses the core issue - coordinating with multiple service providers (telecoms) to understand and fix the connection problems.  This aligns perfectly with the passage's description of needing to investigate and possibly test connections.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: bahu sanchaaraka sewaawan visin laba denu labana pirinaemeem soyanna** (to inform customers about disruptions from multiple telecom service providers) -  While informing customers might *eventually* be necessary, it's a reactive step, not the *initial* action a supervisor would take to resolve the issue.
* **B: guvan sewaawa samaga rijuwama wen karawa ganna** (to directly communicate with customer service) - This is too narrow.  The problem is likely with the underlying network, not just customer service interactions.
* **D: guvan sewaawe web adaviya pareekshaa karanna** (to conduct tests on the connection) - Testing is *part* of the solution, but the first step is to understand *where* the connection issue lies, which requires coordination with the service providers.



Therefore, **C** is the most logical and comprehensive answer based on the provided passage."
"mema chedayata anuwa, haeki hondama prawesha pathra milak laba gaeneema sandaha sanchaarakayeku palamuwa kala yuththe kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: guvan sewaawe web adaviya pareekshaa karanna** (to conduct an examination after receiving government service).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** states: ""...praveshapathra ven kirimata pera guvan sevayema web adaviya da pariksha karanna"" -  ""...and to conduct an examination after government service is received after the application is received.""  This directly translates to conducting an exam *after* being selected for government service.
* **Q (the question)** asks what a recruiter would do *after* receiving a good application.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: vividha sanyukthayan athara mila sansandanaya karanna** (to coordinate with various combinations) - The passage mentions coordination, but not specifically as a direct action *after* receiving the application.
* **C: guvan sewaawa haraha rijuwama wen karawa ganna** (to make government service directly) - This isn't discussed in the passage.
* **D: sanchaaraka niyojithaya haraha rijuwama wen karawa ganna** (to make the recruiter's appointment directly) - This is also not mentioned in the passage.



Therefore, **A** is the only option that aligns with the information provided in the passage."
bhaanda gena yamak samaga ekata yamata keneku awashya wanne kawada da?,"The correct answer is **A: bhaanda guvan pravaahanaya haraha yawana vita** (understanding how to handle customer flow/traffic).

Here's why:

The passage discusses difficulties encountered during a large gathering (""kuriyar samaagam""). It highlights problems with managing the flow of people (""guvan pravaahanaya"") and the resulting congestion and delays. The passage emphasizes the need to understand how people move through the space to improve the situation.  The final sentence specifically states they don't have regulations for managing the flow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: samaagama thamangema guvan yaanayak bhaavitha karana vita** (predicting the customer flow of the gathering) - While prediction is *helpful*, the passage focuses on *handling* the flow that *already exists* and is causing problems.
* **C: pareekshaa karana lada gaman malu lesa dewal yawana vita** (entering the premises with inspection of travel documents) - This is a detail mentioned as a cause of delays, not the core issue to understand.
* **D: bhaanda gena yama vishaala samaagamak visin hasuruwana vita** (being able to enter a large gathering with ease) - This is the *desired outcome* of understanding the flow, but not the essential knowledge required.

"mema chedayata anuwa, sandhaanayaka nithara piyasara karana guvan sewayak thoraa gaeneemedee oba pramukhathawaya laba diya yuththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: waedima lakunu laba dena guvan sewaya** (service that focuses on getting things done quickly).

Here's why:

* **The original text (P) describes a service focused on *immediate* results (""obe nirantara piyaasara guvan sevaya"" - your continuous, urgent service) and emphasizes getting things done quickly (""pirinamanu labana varaprasaada nitharama men venas vena bawath ekama sandhaanaya yatathe wana wenath"" - quickly achieving results, without needing to ask repeatedly).**

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: vishaalathama sandhaanaye guvan sewaya** (service for a large-scale search) - The text focuses on *speed* not *scope*.
* **C: oba boho vita gaman karana guvan sewaya** (service that lets you move forward) - While a quick service *helps* you move forward, it doesn't define the service's primary characteristic.
* **D: amathara waraprasada ek kala haeki guvan sewaya** (service that is a source of long-term blessings) - This implies a longer-term benefit, which is not the focus of the original text's emphasis on *immediate* need and quick fulfillment.

The question (Q) asks what the service prioritizes. Given the text, it's clearly prioritizing getting results *quickly* for the client (""waedi washayenma piyaasara karana"").  Therefore, A is the most accurate answer.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, niranthara piyasara lakunu laba diya haekke katada?","The correct answer is **B: ekama sandhaanaya yatathe oba nithara gaman karana guvan sewaya**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""...pirinamanu labana varaprasaada nitharama men venas vena bawath ekama sandhaanaya yatathe wana wenath guvan sevayaka nirantara piyaasara lakunu waedi washayen thyaagasili viya haeki bawath oba daenagata yutuya.""  This translates to something like ""...you will constantly seek a blessing to obtain results, sacrificing your needs to constantly seek a blessing through a single path of searching.""

* **The question (Q) asks:** ""...how can one obtain constant blessings?""

* **Option B directly reflects the passage's answer:** ""ekama sandhaanaya yatathe oba nithara gaman karana guvan sewaya"" means ""the service (guvan sevaya) you continuously follow on a single path of searching.""  This aligns with the idea of consistently pursuing blessings through dedicated service.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: wenas sandhaanayaka wenas guvan sewayak** (a searching sandhaanaya and a searching guvan sewaya) - The passage emphasizes *one* path, not just any searching.
* **C: wenath sandhaanayaka oba nithara gaman karana lada guvan sewaya** (a searching sandhaanaya and a guvan sewaya you continuously follow) -  Similar to A, lacks the emphasis on *a single* path.
* **D: ekama sandhaanaya thula wenath guvan sewayak** (a searching guvan sewaya on a single sandhaanaya) - This is grammatically awkward and doesn't capture the flow of the original text.

"mema chedayata anuwa, adhika lesa mathpaen paanaya kirimen pahatha sandahan ind‍riya walin durwala viya haekke kumana ind‍riya da?","The passage discusses the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption, leading to long-term illness, mental decline, blindness, and even death. It also mentions adulterated alcohol containing harmful substances like methanol. The question asks which sense is most affected by excessive alcohol consumption, leading to impairment.

Considering the information in the passage and general knowledge about the effects of alcohol:

* **Aeseema (Vision):** While alcohol can eventually lead to blindness (mentioned in the passage), it's a long-term effect.
* **Peneema (Hearing):** Alcohol doesn't directly and immediately affect hearing.
* **Rasa (Taste):** Alcohol affects taste, but not as a primary or immediately noticeable impairment.
* **Suwanda (Smell):** Alcohol significantly impairs judgment, coordination, and *reaction time*, all stemming from affecting the **brain (which processes sensory information)**. This strongly relates to how things *feel* – your sense of balance, spatial awareness, and overall perception.  This aligns with the idea of impaired *indriya* (senses).

Therefore, the best answer is **A: aeseema (Vision)**. Although the passage mentions blindness as a long-term effect, excessive alcohol consumption immediately affects vision.



"
"mema chedaye sandahan wana paridi, mathpaen wala hanikara balapaem awama kala haekke kumak magin da?","The correct answer is **A: methanol sahitha mathpaen paanaya kirima** (consuming alcohol mixed with methanol).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...niti virodhiva saekasu sprithuvala methanol aetulu vividha bhayaanaka apavitra drawya adangu viya haeki athara, evaye kudaa maathraavakin pava anda bhavaya menma maranaya pava sidu viya haekiya.""  This translates to ""...illegally, methanol and various dangerous impure substances are added to alcohol, and even a small amount can lead to blindness and death.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: neethi virodhee lesa nipadawana mathpaen paanaya kirima** (consuming illegally produced alcohol) - While illegal alcohol is dangerous, the passage *specifically* highlights methanol as the primary danger.
* **C: madhyasthawa mathpaen paanaya kirima** (consuming alcohol in moderation) - The passage warns about the *contamination* of alcohol, not necessarily the act of drinking in moderation.
* **D: vividha pudgalayan samaga mathpaen paanaya kirima** (consuming alcohol with various substances) -  This is too broad. The passage pinpoints *methanol* as the specific harmful substance.

Therefore, the passage directly identifies consuming alcohol mixed with methanol as a harmful practice.



"
aemstardaem hi ihalama depala watinaakamak aeththe koheda?,"The correct answer is **A: aela disthrikkaya**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Aela distrikkaya (landesi basin: graechengordel) yanu amsterdaem hi binanstaed vatakara aethi, 17 wana siyavase suprasiddha distrikkai.""  This directly translates to ""Aela district (landesi basin: graechengordel) and Amsterdam are within the Binanstaed area, making it a very famous district of 17 canals.""
* **The question asks:** ""Where are the historical canal areas in Amsterdam?""
* The passage links Amsterdam to the Aela district *within* the Binanstaed area, identifying it as having these canals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the passage mentions UNESCO World Heritage status, it doesn't say *where* the historical canals are located *within* that status.
* **C:**  ""Binanstaed"" is a broader area; the question asks about canals specifically in *Amsterdam*.
* **D:** This is a general description (historical sites), but doesn't pinpoint the location in Amsterdam.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ehi aethi suvisesi sanskruthika saha ayitihaasika agaya hetuven sampurna distrikkayama yunesko loka uruma bhumiyak lesa nam kara aethi.""  This directly translates to ""This is named a UNESCO World Heritage site due to its exceptional cultural and historical significance.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ehi advitheeya lakshana** (this unique characteristic) - While it might *have* unique characteristics, the passage explicitly states the reason for UNESCO recognition is historical and cultural significance.
* **C: binenstaed wata karana lada ehi pihiteema** (the fact that it's built on stilts) -  This is a detail mentioned, but not the *reason* for UNESCO recognition.
* **D: ehi ihala depala watinaakama** (this large temple significance) - This isn't mentioned as the primary reason for UNESCO status.

"mema chedayata anuwa, nom krom wetha yamata watinaakam denne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: tonle saepge darshanaya** (the view of Tonle Sap).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Devamaaligave anduru waathaawaranaya saha tonley saep vilata ihalin penena darshanaya, kanda naegimata vatinaakamak labaa dei.""  This translates to: ""The surrounding environment of Devamaaligave and the beautiful view of Tonle Sap give a pleasing feeling to the eyes.""  It explicitly says the view *provides* that feeling.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: aengkor paas harahaa gaman kirima** (traveling around Angkor Wat) - The passage mentions Angkor entrance tickets but doesn't say traveling around Angkor *provides* the feeling.
* **C: siyam reeyapi daekeema** (Siyam history) - While Siyam history is mentioned, it doesn't relate to the feeling described.
* **D: vilata yana bottu chaarikawa** (traveling by boat) -  The passage mentions boats for transport, but doesn't say *the boat ride itself* creates the feeling.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, nom krom wetha aethulu weemata amuththanta awashya wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: aengkor pas laba gaeneema** (to get the Angkor entrance ticket).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Pansalata aetuluvimata aengkor pravesha pathraya awashya baevin tonley saep wetha yana vita obage videsha gaman balapatraya raegena yaamata amathaka nokaranna."" This translates to: ""If you want to go to Tonley Saep from Pansala, it is necessary to have the Angkor entrance ticket to extend your foreign travel permit.""

* **The question asks:** What is absolutely necessary when going from Nom Krom?  The text connects the need for a ticket to visiting Tonley Saep *from* Pansala, but also implies it's a general requirement for travel in the area, especially for foreigners.  Since Nom Krom is mentioned at the beginning of the text and is within the Angkor region, needing the Angkor entrance ticket is the most logical answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: yasowarman pansala pasukaramin naega yama:**  This is about Yasowarman and doesn't relate to a necessity for travel.
* **B: siya riyapi wata gaman kirima:** This is about going to the Siyam river and doesn’t relate to a travel requirement.
* **D: tonle saep wataa bottu paedeema:** While the text mentions Tonley Saep, it's the *ticket* needed to get *to* Tonley Saep, not the act of going there itself.

"mema chedayata anuwa, aentaktikawa naerabimen sanchaarakayin walakwanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: vishaala sanchaaraka ayawaeyak** (a vast migratory route).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a large area used by migrating birds.** It mentions ""sanchaaraka gaman biman mila adhika wana athara"" (many birds migrate through here) and details a region defined by its geography – peninsula, dunes, coast – that facilitates this migration.  The passage emphasizes the *scale* of the migration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ros muhuda gaweshanaya kirimata aethi ekama unanduwa** (a single resting place for researching the Ros Sea) - The passage doesn't focus on the Ros Sea or research.
* **C: desaembar saha janawaari masawala sanchaaraya kirimata ida salasana kaalasatahanak** (an ideal time for migration in December and January) - While the passage mentions a cold season, it doesn't specify December/January as *ideal*.  It describes the conditions *during* the cold season.
* **D: seemitha bhawthika sanchalathawa** (limited physical movement) - The passage directly contradicts this, describing *extensive* migration.



Therefore, **A** best summarizes what the passage describes about the Antarctic area's role in relation to migrating birds."
kandu naegeemata unanduwak dakwana sanchaarakayeku aentaktikawe kumana pradeshayata sanchaaraya kala haekida?,"The correct answer is **B: abhyanthara pradesha** (the interior region).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gimhanaye dee mehi waasaya karana dahas gananaka karya mandalaya boho durata raendi sitinne ema pradeshawala pihiti dusim 4 kandavuruvalaya; enam sheeta kaalayata naewathee sitina kudaa sankhyaavaka nawaathaenpalawalaya. **Abyantara aentaaktikava ki.mee. 2-3 ka pamana ayisvalin aawaranaya woo hudekala saanuvaki.

This translates to: ""Thousands of research institutes doing winter studies are located far away within this region, and this region is divided into 4 valleys; even during the cold season, a significant number of navigable waterways exist. **The interior of Antarctica is covered in an ice sheet 2-3 km thick.  Specialized vehicles travel within, and valleys and huge crevasses stretch towards the dry valleys.**""

The question asks where a traveler would go if they were following a crevasse. The text directly links crevasses to the *abhyanthara pradesha* (interior region).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ros muhuda (Rose Sea):** While the region is bordered by the Rose Sea, crevasses aren't associated with the sea itself.
*   **C: ardhadweepaya (peninsula):** The text mentions a peninsula as a border but doesn't link crevasses to it.
*   **D: doopath (islands):** The text doesn't suggest crevasses are found on islands.



"
poorwa noothana nireekshanagarayak godanaganu laebeemata adu haekiyawak aeththe koheda?,"The correct answer is **C: durastha sthaanayaka** (distant places).

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Boho nuthana paryeshana dureksa hithakara vaayugoliya thatva sahitha **durastha pradeshawala** aethi vishaala parishra we."" (Many new research explorations with air quality elements are in **distant areas** and involve extensive effort.)
* **Q asks:** Where does the old observation city usually exist?
* The text links the ""old observation city"" (purva nuthana niriksanaagara) with being located in distant areas due to research efforts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: pahasuwen prawesha viya haeki sthaanayaka** (places where access is easy) - The text doesn't mention easy access.
* **B: nagara madhyaye** (city center) - The text specifically points towards *distant* areas, not the city center.
* **D: vishwavid‍yaala parish‍rayaka** (university premises) - While research might happen at universities, the text doesn't specify that the observation city is *on* university premises.



"
naweena paryeshana durekshayak sthaanagatha kala haekke kothaenada?,"The correct answer is **C: adhyaapana sthaanayaka** (teaching place/institution).

Here's why:

* **P's text states:** ""Purva nuthana niriksanaagara ada saamanyayen yalpaena aethi athara eva kautukagara ho **adyaapana sthaana lesa pawathee**.""  This translates to ""Previously, new observations often appear in exhibitions or **teaching institutions**.""

* **Q asks:** ""Where do new research explorations usually take place?""

Since the text in P directly links new observations (and thus, research) to teaching institutions, that's the most logical answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kauthukagarayaka (exhibitions):** While mentioned with observations, it's not where the *exploration* happens.
* **B: vishwa vid‍yaala mandapayaka (university halls):**  A university hall is *part* of a teaching institution, but ""teaching institution"" is a broader and more encompassing answer based on the text.
* **D: vishaala parish‍rayaka (vast effort):** This refers to the work involved, not the *location* of the research.

"mema chedayata anuwa, nihanda werala dinayak sandaha wadaath sudusu wanne kumana pradeshayada?","The correct answer is **C: uthuru waraaya disthrikkaya** (Northern Waraya District).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Uthuru muhudu tiraye verala (uthuru varaaya distrikkaye) paesific saagaraye pihita aethi athara uthure long be sita dakune devonpot dakvaa vihide.""  This translates to ""Verela on the northern coast (Northern Waraya District) is located facing the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.""

The question asks for the region where a hidden day trip is suggested. The passage describes Verela *within* the Northern Waraya District, and implies it's a good location for exploration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sent heliyars:**  Sent Heliyars is mentioned *near* Verela, but isn't the broader region.
*   **B: mishan be:** Similar to Sent Heliyars, Mishan Be is a specific location within the area, not the region itself.
*   **D: wayitemata waraaya:** This doesn't appear anywhere in the text.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, pihinum thathwayan wadaath aarakshitha viya haekke kothaenada?","The correct answer is **A: devonpot**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...dakune devonpot dakvaa vihide. Eva aarakshitha pihinima sahitha..."" which translates to ""...south of Devonport can be seen. This is a beach with unprotected shallows...""

This directly identifies Devonport as the location with unprotected shallows (aarakshitha pihinima).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: uthuru waraaya disthrikkaya (North Shore District)** - The passage mentions the North Shore District as a general area, but doesn't pinpoint it as the location of the unprotected shallows.
*   **C: madhyama okland (Central Auckland)** - While mentioned in relation to a drive, it's not where the shallows are.
*   **D: long be (Long Bay)** -  It's mentioned as a location *within* the North Shore District, but Devonport is specifically highlighted as having the unprotected shallows.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes respect for nature (adaviya), compassion (karuna), and coexistence with all beings (sansunva saha buhuman sahitava salakanna).** It specifically calls for honoring the forest and living harmoniously with its creatures.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: sansunwa haesireema (to be mindful):** While mindfulness is *part* of the message, it's not the central point about the specific location.
    * **C: vihilu kirima (to destroy):** The passage explicitly states ""samula ghaatanaya ho naaseen pilibanda vihilu nokaranna"" (do not destroy or cause ruin).
    * **D: vyuhayak matha kurutu gaema (to build strategies/schemes):**  The passage cautions against manipulating or distorting the location (""vyuha mata kurutu gaemen ho seereemen mema sthaanaya vikurti nokaranna"").

The question asks about what the passage details *about the place itself* and how to approach it. Respecting the forest and its inhabitants is the most accurate interpretation of the text's instructions.



"
podu bhaashawan visthara karanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: kruthima**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Upakaaraka bhaasha yanu sannivedana kirimata wenath aakaraye apahasutaava aethi pudgalayin athara sannivedanaya pahasu kireeme adahasin saedunu **kruthima** ho nirmana kala bhaasha wei.""  This translates to something like: ""Artificial or constructed languages are those that are not naturally arising from the needs of people, but are deliberately created to convey messages.""

* **The question (Q) asks:** ""What is the expansion of 'podu bhashawan' (common language) like?""

* The passage directly contrasts ""podu bhashawan"" (natural language) with **""kruthima""** (artificial/constructed language).  The implication is that natural languages *aren't* artificial.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: aswabhavika (unnatural):** While artificial languages *are* unnatural, the passage emphasizes the deliberate *creation* aspect, making ""kruthima"" a more direct answer to how common languages differ.
* **C: godanaga gath (complex story):** This is irrelevant to the passage's topic.
* **D: moolika (original/root):**  The passage implies natural languages are original, but ""kruthima"" specifically addresses what they *aren't* – artificially made.

Here's why:

* **P's text** describes a constructed language (a *kruthima ho nirmana kala bhaasha*) designed to express the subtle nuances of feeling and perception that natural languages often miss. It's meant to be a foundational language (*moolika bhaasha*) that aims for more precise communication.

* **Q asks** what the *upakaraka bhaasha* aims to expand upon.

* **Option A** directly addresses this: it states the language is a foundational one designed to accurately convey the feelings and perceptions of individuals, going beyond the limitations of existing languages.  This aligns perfectly with the description in P.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ewa swabhavika ha godanagagath bhaasha we** (It is a natural and developed language) - This is the *opposite* of what P describes. P clearly states it's *constructed* not natural.
* **C: ewa apahasu sanniwedana awasthaa waedi diyunu kirima sandaha godanagana lada bhaashawan we** (It is a language developed to easily express subtle emotional states) - While it *does* aim to express subtle states, the key is *how* - by being a foundational/primary language, not just by being easily developed.
* **D: ewa vividha bhaasha katha karannan athara prachalitha godanagana lada bhaashawan we** (It is a language spoken by various people and developed through common usage) - Again, this is contrary to the description of a constructed language.

"mema chedayata anuwa, magiyeku owunge yathrawe gamana sheetha irthuwe nam pareekshaa kala yuththe kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: kutiye pihiteema**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Sheeta kaalaye dee uthuru boltik pradeshaya tharanaya karanne nam, **kutiye pihitima pariksha karanna.**"" (If you are planning to cross the northern, bolted region during the Sheeta season, **you must pass the cutie permit examination.**)
* **The question (Q) asks:** ""...magiyeku owunge yathrawe gamana sheetha irthuwe nam pareekshaa kala yuththe kumakda?"" (...if someone is going on a journey during the Sheeta season, what examination must they pass?)

Therefore, the passage directly states that the ""kutiye pihitima pariksha"" (cutie permit examination) is required.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: visaa awashyatha** (visa requirement) - The passage says a visa isn't *necessary* (""naewehi mageenta visaa awashya nove"").
* **C: niyamayan** (regulation) -  The passage mentions a regulatory check (""niyamayan pariksha kara balanna"") but doesn’t specify it’s the main examination.
* **D: nagaraye gatha kala kalaya** (time spent in the city) -  This refers to time spent in St. Petersburg and isn’t a required examination.



"
"mema lipiyata anuwa, magiyekuge yathrawe gamana gimhanaye nam, owun walakwa gatha yuthu de kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: ayis haraha gaman kirima**.

Here's why:

* **P's text mentions:** ""...manda ayis harahaa gaman kirimedi..."" (meaning ""slowly, the ice began to move..."") and describes a journey related to this.
* **Q asks:** ""...magiyekuge yathrawe gamana gimhanaye nam, owun walakwa gatha yuthu de kumakda?"" (meaning ""If the journey described in the text is about a voyage, what is mentioned about it?"")

The text specifically details the *movement of the ice* during the journey, making ""ayis haraha gaman kirima"" (the ice starting to move) the most relevant answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: nagaraye welaawa** (city timing) -  Santa Petersburg is mentioned, but the question is about the *journey* itself, not the timing of being in a city.
* **C: visaa awashyatha** (visa requirements) - The text states no visa is needed, but that's a side detail, not the focus of the journey description.
* **D: sent peetarasbarg** (St. Petersburg) -  Again, a location mentioned, but not the core aspect of the journey described.

kaetalan boho vita basilonaa sanngaa saha niwedana sandaha bhaavitha karanne aeyi?,"The correct answer is **A: eya spaangnga bhaashawata wadaa pulul lesa therum gatha haekiya** (It is understood more easily with the Spanish language).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Saema denaama paahe spangna bhaashaava daniti."" (Many know it due to the Spanish language.)  It also says Spanish is widely used and understood.
* **The question asks:** How is Catalan easily associated in Basilone?
* **Option A** directly addresses this connection to Spanish being helpful for understanding Catalan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: eya nagaraye palamu nila bhaashawa viya** (It is the official language of the city) - While the passage mentions it *could* be established as an official language, it states it *isn't* currently.
* **C: basilonaa we wadaath kaemathi bhaashawa meyayi** (It is the most important language in Basilone) - The passage implies Spanish is more dominant.
* **D: mett‍ro maarga saha anekuth podu pahasukam boho vita kaetalan bhaashawa katha karana purawaesiyan nithara paeminena sthaana we** (There are places where many people speak Catalan on the metro and public transport) - The passage does *not* mention Catalan being widely spoken in public spaces; it highlights the difficulty in getting announcements made in Catalan.



"
barsilonaa mett‍ro paddhathiya nithya niwedana prakaashayata path kirima sandaha pahatha sandahan bhaasha atharin bhaavitha karanne kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: katalaan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nagaraye nitya nivedana kaetalan bhaashaaven nikuth karanu labana namuth saelasum nokarana lada baadha kireem...""  This translates to ""The city tries to make daily announcements in Catalan, but it is difficult because there are not enough...""  This directly indicates that Catalan is used for daily announcements in Barcelona's metro system, despite challenges.

While the passage mentions other languages are *also* used through automated systems, it specifically highlights the *attempt* to use Catalan for live announcements.

"mema chedayata anuwa, supiri aendan saha udaesana aaharaya sandaha pramukhathawaya laba deemata ida nomaeththe pahatha sandahan pahasukam atharin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: visheshanga menu ayithamayan (specifically menu items)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses a luxurious dining experience focusing on exquisite dishes (supiri aendan - luxurious ingredients, udaesana aahara - unique food) and the overall atmosphere. The question asks *what* the passage primarily focuses on when discussing these luxurious ingredients and unique food.  The passage details the *types* of food, the flavors, and the presentation – essentially, what's *on the menu*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: advitheeya pawuraanika lee badu (unique historical writing):** While the passage mentions historical connections, the *focus* isn't on the writing itself, but on how food connects to history.
* **C: hondin nadaththu karana lada elimahan awakaashayan (opportunities for comfortable and convenient locations):** Location is mentioned as part of the overall experience, but is not the primary focus.
* **D: wegawath wayifayi (speed of service):** The passage doesn't discuss how quickly the food is served.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer because the passage concentrates on describing the food itself – the menu items and their qualities."
"mema chedayata anuwa, wadaath sukhopabhogee aendan saha udaesana aahara athara pradhaana tharagakaree sthaanayak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: supiri aendan (superior ingredients)**.

Here's why:

The passage heavily emphasizes the quality of ingredients (""supiri aendan"") and how they contribute to a captivating experience (""kalaatmaka bhavayak aethi kara thibe""). It connects this to both the cause (nidana) and effect (udaya) of the dining experience, implying high-quality ingredients are fundamental.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: samakaleena alankaranaya (contemporary decoration):** While ambiance is important, the passage focuses more on the *taste* and *source* of the food.
* **B: irthumaya aahara paraasayak pirinaemeema (irresistible food presentation):** Presentation is mentioned as part of the overall experience, but not as the *primary* factor.
* **D: desheeyawa labagath aahara saha beema (locally available food and insurance):**  While locally sourced food could be a part of it, the passage doesn't emphasize this specifically, and insurance is irrelevant to the described experience.



Therefore, the passage most directly points to **superior ingredients** as the main factor in creating a memorable and captivating dining experience."
"mema chedayata anuwa, 2022 dee beejin hi nopaewaethwenne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: thayisicheng skee pradeshaye isaw** (the ice province/region games).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Anekuth skeeyin isav bijing sita kilometer 220 k (saethapum 140 k) durin pihiti shaenjiyako hi thayisichen skee pradeshayedhi paewaethwey.""  This translates to: ""Numerous winter sports were held in Beijing and surrounding areas, including a 220 km (140 miles) area in the ice province region.""

The question asks what Beijing hosted in 2022. The passage specifically highlights the winter sports *within* the ice province region, making it the most accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: viwurtha kirime uthsawa (opening ceremony):**  While Beijing hosted the opening ceremony, that's just *part* of what it hosted, not the entire event.
* **C: samaapthi uthsawa (closing ceremony):** Similar to the opening ceremony, it’s a part, not the whole.
* **D: gruhastha ayis isaw (home ice games):** This is a general description, not a specific event hosted.

"mema chedayata anuwa, 2022 dee beejin visin sathkarakathwaya daranu labanne pahatha sandahan dae athurin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: sheetha olimpik**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""emagin gimhana saha **sheeta olympik** tharaga yana dekama sandaha satkaarakatvaya saepayu palamu nagaraya bavata path wei."" This translates to ""Beijing was selected as the host city for both the Summer and **Winter Olympics**.""

The question asks what Beijing hosted in 2022. The text focuses on Beijing hosting the Winter Olympics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: gimhana olimpik (Summer Olympics):** While Beijing hosted the Summer Olympics before, the text specifically refers to the *2022* event being the Winter Olympics.
*   **B: gruhasthawa sidu kerena ayis isaw (domestic ice sports services):** This is a detail *within* the hosting of the Olympics, not the main event itself.
*   **D: samaapthi uthsawa (closing ceremony):** The closing ceremony is a *part* of the Olympics, not the whole event that Beijing hosted.



"
kurulu influvensa waelandeeme waedima avadaanamak aeththe katada?,"The correct answer is **A: paksheen narambannan** (पक्षීන් नरमबन्धन).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""namuth paksheen narambannanta yam avadaanama da aetha."" (නමුත් පක්ෂීන් නරඹන්නන්‍ට යම් අවධානයම ද ඇත).  This translates to ""But there is some attention given to bird watchers.""  

The question asks what influence the *kurulu* (bird) has. The passage directly links the bird to attention from *paksheen narambannan* (bird watchers).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ksheerapayi sathun samaga waeda karana aya (ක්ෂීරපායී සතුන් සමඟ වැඩ කරනා අය)** - This refers to people working with mammals, which isn't mentioned as being influenced by the bird.
* **C: kukulu ghanaye govipalawala waeda karana aya (කුකුළු ගණයේ ගොවිපාලවාල වැඩ කරනා අය)** - This refers to people working with poultry/chickens, also not directly related to the bird's influence.
* **D: meeta pera aasadanaya wu pudgalayin (මීට පෙර ආසදනය වූ පුද්ගලයින්)** -  This refers to previous supporters, and doesn't relate to the bird's influence.

Here's why:

* **The original passage (P) states:** ""Boho eva kukulu ganaye govipalavala waeda karana aya ha sambandha wee aetha..."" (And there is a connection to those who do business with chicken farms and cattle sheds...)
* **Question (Q) asks:** What further detail expands on the mention of chickens?
* **Option A** directly refers to those who do business with chicken farms (""kukulu ghanaye govipalawala waeda karana ayata""), expanding on that part of the original text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** Mentions humans and disease, which isn't the focus of the chicken reference.
* **C:** Relates to birds causing discomfort, a secondary point, not the main expansion on the chicken mention.
* **D:** Refers to the overall impact on people, not specifically chickens.



Therefore, **A** is the most relevant and direct continuation of the thought presented in the original passage."
sudu muhuda-boltik aela sambandha karanne kumak da?,"The correct answer is **B: onega vila saha volga ganga**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Sudu muhuda - boltik aela onegaa vila, laedoga vila saha shaanta pietersburg haraha waedi washayen ganga saha vil magin aaktic samudraya boltik muhuda samaga sambandha karayi.""  And later, ""Onegaa vila, volga nadiyatat sambandha wana baevin, rusiyaava tulin kaespiyan muhuda harahaa paeminimata thawamath haekiya.""

This directly links the White Sea-Baltic Sea connection to the Onegaa Vila (river) and the Volga River.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: kalu muhuda saha kaespiyan muhuda:** While the passage *mentions* these seas, it doesn't describe them as being *connected* to the White Sea-Baltic Sea.
*   **C: aaktic saagaraya saha boltik muhuda:** The text says they are connected *through* rivers and canals, not directly.
*   **D: dakshina sa garaya saha rathu muhuda:** These are not mentioned in the text.

"mema chedayata anuwa, magiyata badhaa nokarana andamin videsha gaman balapapra ekathu kala haekke kumana aakaraye waahanayakinda?","The correct answer is **B: raathree nidana dumriya** (night mail train).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a train that runs at night and doesn't disturb your sleep.**  The phrase ""Raathri nidana dumriya thula obage nindata baadha novena lesa kondostaravaraya visin gaman balapatra ekathu karanu laebe"" directly translates to ""The night mail train allows you to comfortably travel with a ticket, without disturbing your sleep.""
* **The question asks for the type of vehicle that allows travel abroad without causing sleep disturbance.**  The night mail train fits this description.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: guvan yanaa (goods train)** - Goods trains are for cargo, not passengers, and don't emphasize comfort or sleep.
* **C: naew (navy/ship)** -  The passage discusses land travel (trains), not sea travel (ships).
* **D: deshaseema athara yana dumriya (border crossing train)** - While this train crosses borders, the passage specifically highlights its comfort for sleep, which is not a primary feature of simply crossing a border.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, samahara deshaseema athara yana dumriya waladee obe haendunumpatha pareekshaa kirimata ida aeththe kawadada?","The correct answer is **A: dumriyen baesa giya pasu** (the animal that went with the train).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Samahara desha seema athara yana dumriya thula pariksha kerenne dumriya gaman ganna atharathura wana athara mema dumriyakata goda vena vita oba laga valangu haedunumpatak tibiya yutuya.""  This translates to something like: ""Along with the train that travels across many country borders, there's an animal that goes with the train, and it's worth noting this animal alongside the train for your consideration.""
* **The question (Q) asks:** ""Following this story, if trains traveling across many country borders are being examined, what would that be about?""

Therefore, the logical conclusion is that the examination would be *about the animal that travels with the train*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: oba nidaa sitina vita** (you being asleep) - The passage mentions night travel and not disturbing sleep, but the core focus is not on someone sleeping.
* **C: eya pareekshaa nokere** (it doesn't get examined) -  The question *assumes* it's being examined.
* **D: dhaawanaya wana dumriye** (the train running) - While the train is mentioned, the emphasis is on *something else* that accompanies it.

singappooruwe ihala niwarthana kalaapaye raendee sitina kalaya thula boho vita siduviya haekke pahatha sandahan gaetaluwalin kawareda?,"Let's break down the question and the provided text to find the correct answer.

**Understanding P (the text):**

The text describes Singapore as a very safe place generally, but acknowledges it can be extremely hot and humid. It also mentions a ""high return"" campaign (likely referring to a tourism or business initiative).  The key part is the warning about intense heat (persistently) and heavy rain (frequently).

**Understanding Q (the question):**

The question asks about what someone might experience *during* Singapore's ""high return"" campaign, based on the text. It's asking for a likely consequence.

**Analyzing the options:**

* **A: Kollakaemata lak weema (It gets dark easily):** While darkness comes, the text doesn't focus on this. It's not a primary consequence described.
* **B: Sappu walata praweshayak nomaethi weema (There is no entry to the soap area):** This is completely unrelated to the text.
* **C: Ihala ushnathwayen vidaawata pathweema (Suffering from intense heat):**  This *directly* aligns with the text's warning about ""ihala ushnathwaya (niraturuvama)"" - persistent intense heat. This is the most likely experience during the campaign, as the text warns about it.
* **D: Atharaman weema (It's scary):** The text doesn't mention anything about being scared. It speaks to environmental conditions, not emotional responses.

**Therefore, the correct answer is C: Ihala ushnathwayen vidaawata pathweema (Suffering from intense heat).**

"
jarmanu pestri anubhawa kirimen waelakee siteemata awashya viya haekke katada?,"The passage describes German pastries as being enjoyed with coffee, often containing nuts, fruits (like plums), and flavors like vanilla. It mentions ""gasvala aeta warga"" (things with vanilla flavor) being common.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: gaswala aeta warga walata daedi aasathmikathawayak aethi aya** (it is important to have an understanding of things with vanilla flavor when experiencing German pastries).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: dhanawath athurupasa walata waedi kaemaeththak dakwana aya** (it is necessary to be able to identify wealthy appearances) - This is irrelevant to the passage.
* **C: chokalat walata akamaethi aya** (it is necessary to dislike chocolate) - The passage doesn't mention chocolate.
* **D: saera saha aembul rasa walata wadaa paeni rasa walata kaemathi aya** (it is necessary to be familiar with sour and mango flavors or sweet pineapple flavors) - These flavors aren't specifically mentioned.



"
germanu pestri wala irthumaya angayak lesa salakanu labanne kumana amud‍ravyayada?,"The correct answer is **A: aepal** (apples).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Varshaya purama pestrivala aepal saekasum sahitava, palaturu pestri bahula wana athara..."" which translates to ""During the year, apple sauce accompanies pastries, especially fruit pastries...""  This directly links apples to pastries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: hesalnats (hazelnuts):** While mentioned as a food Germans like, it isn't specifically stated as *in* the pastries.
* **C: plam (plum):** Plums are mentioned as being with cherry but doesn't refer to being *in* the pastries.
* **D: baadam (almond):** Almonds are also listed as a German food, but not specifically as an ingredient *in* the pastries.

"mema chedayata anuwa, adu ayawaeyak samaga gaman sandaha nirdeshayak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: sanchaaraya atharathura amuthu raekiya seweema** (communication beyond the limits of your established field/expertise).

Here's why:

The passage (P) extensively discusses the dangers of communicating beyond one's competence, venturing into areas one doesn't understand, and the potential harm that can result from doing so. It emphasizes staying within the bounds of one's knowledge and experience.  The phrasing ""sanchaaraya karana athara waeda kireem ho obage viyadam seemaa kirimata uthsaha kirimayi"" directly supports this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: obe suwapahasu mattama samaga nam‍yasheelee weema** (being humble with your own intelligence) - While humility is good, the passage isn't *about* humility, it's about *competence*.
* **C: minisungen mudal illaa siteema** (a situation with no basis in people) - This is too vague and doesn't relate to the core message.
* **D: aahara saha nawaathaen waeni viyadam kapaa haereema** (covering up flaws in food and ingredients) - This is completely unrelated to the passage's topic of communication and knowledge boundaries.

The question (Q) asks what the passage warns against, and venturing beyond your established area of communication is the central warning. Therefore, option A is the most accurate and relevant answer.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, itha awama ayawaeyak samaga gaman kirimata apahasu kalayak thibiya haekke katada?","The correct answer is **C: sanchaaraya karana atharathura durasthawa waeda kirimata saelasum karana kenek** (Someone who enthusiastically tries to communicate through various means, even from a distance).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes someone relentlessly trying to communicate.**  It talks about making efforts to reach out, pushing boundaries (""obage viyadam seemaa kirimata uthsaha kirimayi""), and not giving up despite potential difficulties.  The phrase ""sanchaaraya karana atharathura durasthawa waeda kirimata saelasum karana kenek"" perfectly captures this persistent communication effort.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: abhiyogayak piligannaa kenek** (Someone who accuses) - The passage doesn't focus on accusations, but on *attempting* communication.
    * **B: daedi kala seemawan nomaethi keneku** (Someone who doesn't know boundaries of time and space) - While the person is persistent, the text doesn't say they're unaware of limitations, just that they *try* despite them.
    * **D: gaman saelaesmata anuwa kriya kirimata kaemati kenek** (Someone who does things following travel plans) - The passage doesn't mention travel or plans; it's purely about communication.

**In essence, the passage is a description of someone incredibly eager and determined to connect with others through communication.** Option C best embodies that characteristic.

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Pera haa pasu kotasvala prakaashitha vega seema kaepi penena lesa aduya - saamanyayen pae./ki.mee. 35 - 40 (pae/ki.mee. 56 - 64) - saha ese naethinam evata anugatha vima eetat vada vaedagat we."" This translates to ""Observe the posted speed limits for animals and livestock - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and do not exceed this limit under any circumstances.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: dura baehaera pradeshawala digu maarga thibe:** (long, winding roads in rural areas) - While mentioned, this isn't the direct answer to the question about what to pay attention to.
* **B: mantheeru patu we:** (slow down for hills) - Also mentioned, but not the primary focus of the question.
* **D: jangama durakathana sewaawa gaetaluwak noviya yuthuya:** (use caution when approaching moving accidents) -  This is mentioned towards the end and isn't the core advice about driving in this area.

"mema chedayata anuwa, bafalo-pitsbarg adhiwegee maargaye gaman karana riyadurange pradhaana awadhaanaya yomu viya yuththe mewayin kumak sandahada?","The correct answer is **A: adhika waahana thadabadayaka sira wee siteema** (excessive vehicle congestion causing speed limits).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses heavily on the dangers of driving amidst livestock and the need to be aware of speed limits.** It mentions ""hudekala wanaanthara bim theeru nirantarayen pasu kerena"" (animals constantly crossing the road in forested areas) and specific speed limits (35-40 km/h, 56-64 km/h).  The passage explicitly states that these speed limits are *not* always adhered to.
* **The passage describes a road with potential for accidents (""jangama durakathana sevava"") but the *cause* of the danger is highlighted as traffic and ignoring speed limits.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pramaanawath jangama durakathana sewaawak nomaethi weema** (lack of proper mobile emergency services) – While the passage hints at potential accidents, it doesn't focus on the *availability* of emergency services.
* **C: thiyunu wanguwak itha wegayen gaeneema** (driving at a high speed due to available space) – The passage warns *against* high speeds, not advocating for them.
* **D: nithara maarga idikirimawalata muhuna deema** (focusing on improving road infrastructure) – The passage doesn’t mention road improvements, it focuses on driver behavior and awareness.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer as it directly relates to the central theme of the passage - the dangers of traffic and exceeding speed limits in an area frequented by animals."
kurubiliyak aarambha kirimata awashya nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: pihineeme haekiyawa** (being physically fit).

Here's why:

The passage states that while Kurubiliya (and similar activities) *can* be demanding physically, it's **not essential** to be in peak physical condition to *start*. It gives examples like peak fitness, scuba diving, and alpine skiing, where high physical fitness *is* needed, contrasting it with Kurubiliya.  The key phrase is ""namuth eya aarambha kireema sandaha sapeksava etharam puhunuvak how saririka haedayak awashya nove"" - meaning ""but to *start* with this activity, a high level of physical fitness is not necessarily required.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: uparima shareerika thaththwaya** (peak physical fitness) - The passage explicitly states this isn't *required* to begin.
* **C: paeneeme haekiyawa** (being trained) - Training comes *after* starting, not as a prerequisite.
* **D: sulu pramaanayaka puhunuwa** (sufficient refreshment/hydration) - While important for *during* the activity, it's not what's needed to *begin*.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses entirely on ""kurubiliya saekasima"" (the kurubiliya region).** It describes activities within that region and the physical demands (or lack thereof) associated with them.
* **The question asks what the passage *primarily* requires knowledge of to understand it.**  Understanding the kurubiliya saekasima – what it is, the activities available there – is crucial.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: usas malala kreedaa haekiyawa (it is a warm-weather sport):** While some activities mentioned might be warm-weather sports, the passage isn't *about* warm-weather sports generally.
* **B: skooba kimidum pilibanda poorwa athdaekeema (previous knowledge about scuba diving):** Scuba diving is just *one example* used in the passage. You don't need prior scuba knowledge to understand the passage; the passage explains that even those activities don't require extensive physical fitness.
* **D: pihineeme haekiyawa (it is swimming):** Similar to scuba diving, swimming is only one example. The core of the passage is about the region, not swimming in general.

"mema chedaya anuwa, thama motar rathaye kandawuru baendeemak saelasum karana kenekuta prayojanawath wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: obe waahanaye seemawan gaena honda awabodhayak** (someone who has a good understanding of your vehicle's limitations).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes ""kandavuru baedheemata"" (dangerously overtaking) as a result of drivers not understanding the limitations of their vehicles.** They overestimate their ability to pass safely, particularly with larger vehicles (SUVs, vans, sedans, station wagons).  The passage highlights that failing to appreciate these limits leads to reckless overtaking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: aasana digahaeriya haeki waahanayak (a vehicle with comfortable seats)** – Comfort isn't related to dangerous overtaking.
* **C: koodaaramak (crowded)** – Crowded roads might *contribute* to risky behavior, but aren't the core reason for dangerous overtaking described in the text.
* **D: kandawuru baendeemata pawudgalika bhoomiyak (a dangerous overtaking personality)** – The passage isn’t about a personality type; it’s about a lack of *awareness* of vehicle capabilities.



Therefore, understanding your vehicle's limitations is crucial to avoid dangerous overtaking, making option A the most appropriate answer."

* **The passage (P)** discusses how motor vehicles, especially larger ones (SUVs, minivans, station wagons), require more space and attention due to their size. It highlights that they can be difficult to maneuver (""kandavuru baedheemata"" - difficult to steer) and require drivers to be more cautious.
* **The question (Q)** asks what needs to be considered when driving a motor vehicle that requires extra attention due to its size.
* **Option A** directly addresses this by stating the need to drive a large vehicle (SUV or minivan).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: digu maarga gamanak yama** (Being careful when traveling on long roads) - While long roads are mentioned, the core issue is the *size* of the vehicle, not just the distance traveled.
* **C: nagaraye ho pawudgalika bhoomiyaka koodaaram gaeseema** (Navigating urban or crowded areas) -  Crowded areas *exacerbate* the problem, but the fundamental need for caution stems from the vehicle's size.
* **D: owun bhaavitha karana waahanaya gaena daenumak nomaethi weema** (Not knowing how to handle the vehicle you are driving) - While important, this is a general driving skill.  The passage focuses specifically on the challenges posed by *larger* vehicles.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, dewana wathawatath kaesablaanka naewatha goda naeguwe kawuda?","The correct answer is **B: spaangnga welendun**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Morokkanu sultan naewatha nagaraya godanaegooye daru ayi-badya namin wana athara ehi velenda mulasthaana sthaapitha kotagat **spaangna velandun** visin kaesablanka yana naamaya dene ladi.""

This translates to: ""Although the Moroccan sultan also tried to rebuild the city, it was named Casablanca by the **Spanish** who established a base here.""

Therefore, the Spanish were the ones who named Casablanca.



"
swabhavika vyasanayakin pasuwa noothana kaesablaenka nagaraya athahaera dama giye kawuda?,"The correct answer is **B: pruthugeeseen**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Eya pruthugeesin visin vinaasha kala athara kaesaa branka yana namin naewatha eya godanagana lada athara..."" which translates to ""It was not named after the destruction by the Portuguese, but after being rebuilt..."" 

This directly indicates the Portuguese were involved in a destructive event related to the city's history, thus a natural disaster attributed to them.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, sint‍raa videshikayan athara piligaeneemak laba gaththe keseda?","The correct answer is **B: mariya thumiyage darshana**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mariyatumiyage darshana valata lowa pura prasiddha uthure aethi apage faathimaa maathavage maha siddhasthaanaya (pujaasanaya) naerambimatada yanna.""  This translates to: ""Following Mariya Thumiya's vision, the famous northern site near our Fatima Mother's great sacred place (shrine) is being renovated.""

The question asks what Sintraa gained from foreigners and pilgrimage. The passage directly links Sintraa's fame and renovation to the vision of Mariya Thumiya and the shrine dedicated to Fatima Mother.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kaebo da roka:** This refers to the 403 Scoturb bus route, which is about transportation, not the reason for Sintraa's fame.
* **C: bairan samiwarayaage dhanaathmaka samalochana:** This refers to the financial review by Bairan Samivaraya, not the origin of its popularity.
* **D: ehi aadara ithihasaya:** While Sintraa likely has a rich history, the passage focuses on a *recent* cause for increased attention – the vision and shrine.



"
aarmeniyawa visin piliganu nolabanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: naagorno-karabak kalaapaya** (Nagorno-Karabakh conflict).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""kisindu sthaapitha jaathiyak - armeniyavavat - eya nila washayen piliganne naetha."" (it did not recognize it as a nation-state of Armenian ethnicity).  This refers directly to the Nagorno-Karabakh region.  Armenia attempted to establish a new nation, but it wasn't internationally recognized *because* of the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: aseriwarunta erehi yuddhaya** (Azerbaijani's aggressive war) - The passage *mentions* the war, but doesn't say Armenia wasn't recognized *because* of it.
* **C: asarbaijanaye raajyathanthrika tharka** (Azerbaijan's state logic) - This is a contributing factor to the conflict, but not the direct reason for lack of recognition of Armenia.
* **D: nawa janarajaya** (new nation) - While Armenia *tried* to build a new nation, the passage explains why that effort was hindered – the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh.



"
asarbaijanaya saha aarmeniyawa athara sambandhathawayata akhandawa balapanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: naagorno-karabak kalaapaya** (Nagorno-Karabakh conflict).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the conflict (kalaapaya) between Armenia and Azerbaijan stemmed from and significantly impacted the relationship between the two countries. It highlights how the dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh caused ""rajyathanthrika mathabhedayan"" (political disagreements) and ""baadha karamin sity"" (caused obstacles) in their relationship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: asarbaijanaye jiwath wana aarmeniyanuwan** (Armenians living in Azerbaijan) - While the presence of Armenians in Azerbaijan is a *part* of the issue, it's not the overarching reason for the strained relationship.
*   **B: 1994 yuddhaya** (1994 war) - The 1994 war was a *result* of the conflict, not the conflict itself.
*   **C: raajyathanthrika tharka** (political logic) - This refers to the disagreements, not the root cause of them.



"
"chaalat hi kulee rathayak gannaa atharathura, amathara gaasthuwakata hethu viya haekke kumak da?","The correct answer is **D: pawul hithaishee weema** (because of the child's preference).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Uthuru kaerolinaave chaalat nagaraye ek prabala lakshanayak wanne pavul sandaha usas thattvaye vikalpa gananaavak tibimayi...daruvan samaga nagaraya hondin atvindiya haeki bhava aagantukayanta peneti.""  This translates to ""Choosing a city in North Carolina with a strong characteristic was based on the child's wishes...making the city appealing to visitors with children.""

Later it says: ""chaalat hi pavul saamanyayen kuli rathha bhaavitha nokarayi"" meaning ""This choice wasn't typically a popular choice."" This directly links the choice to the child's preference rather than general popularity or location.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: wenath pradeshayaka padinchi weema** (being west of the state) - The passage doesn't emphasize location within North Carolina as a primary factor.
*   **B: mageen thideneku siteema** (the limit of the past two days) - This refers to a recent site visit, not the reason for *choosing* the city initially.
*   **C: nagaraya thulata yama** (what the city offers) -  While the city has appealing features, those features are *because* of the child's preference, not the primary reason for selection.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, chaalat hi daruwan samaga jiwath weeme awaasiyak lesa saelakiya haekke kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: wenath pradeshawalin paeminena nevaasikayan** (residents who prioritize living in North Carolina).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Wenath pradeshawalin paemini nevaasikayan nitharama pavasanne ehi paeminimata pradhaana hetuva ehi pawathina pavul hithaisi bhavaya wana athara..."" This directly translates to ""A major reason people choose to live here is the strong desire of residents to live in North Carolina.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: niwasa mila ganan (population count):** While population is mentioned indirectly, the passage focuses on *why* people choose to live there, not just *how many* live there.
* **B: kulee rathayak laba gaeneema (getting a cool job):** The passage mentions job opportunities as a contributing factor, but it's not the primary focus. It's about people prioritizing *living* in North Carolina.
* **D: nagaraya rasa vindeemata uthsaha kirima (being enthusiastic about city life):** The passage highlights the appeal of city life *to visitors*, but the driving force for residents is their desire to live in the state itself.



"
"spaangnga jaathikayan paemineemata pera, chilee hi uthuru kotasa palanaya kale kawuda?","The correct answer is **A: Mapuche**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""madyama saha dakunu chiliye svadesika aerokaeniyaanvaru (maepuche) waasaya kalaha"" which translates to ""in the central and southern parts of Chile, indigenous peoples (Mapuche) lived.""  It then goes on to say they were never fully subdued by the Spanish and remained a free indigenous group in America.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Aemarikanuwan:** This isn't mentioned in the text in relation to northern Chile.
*   **C: Arawukaniyanuwan:** This group is not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Inkas:** The text mentions the Incas in the north, but states the Mapuche were prominent in the central and southern regions.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, 1810 dee sidu nowuye pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **D: chilee nidahasa prakaashayata path karayi** (chile independence was declared).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""1810 dee chiliya svaadhinatvaya prakaashayata path kala muth..."" This directly translates to ""In 1810, the path was opened to declare Chile's independence...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: madhyama rajayak nomaethi viya** (a middle state was formed) - The passage mentions a ""madyama rajayak"" but states it *wasn't* active/functional.
* **B: chilee spaangngayata erehiwa jayagrahanaya athkara gaththeya** (chile suffered an imposed Spanish conquest) - While eventually conquered, the passage focuses on the initial declaration of independence *before* the conquest.
* **C: naepoliyanu yuddha walata erehiwa satan kerini** (was involved in the Napoleonic wars) -  The passage only *mentions* the Napoleonic wars as context, not as a direct involvement of Chile.



"
liguriya kalaapaye dura baehaera gammanawalata minisun paeminenne keseda?,"The correct answer is **B: motar ratha ho dumriya magin**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""manpet, dumriya saha bottu magin gammana yaa kerena athara, pitathin motor rathha valata ehi paeminiya nohaeka.""  This translates to ""There is no permission for motor vehicles here, only going by foot, donkey, and boat.""

Therefore, people can reach the villages in Liguria either by **motor ratha (motor vehicle) or dumriya (donkey)**, as the text explicitly states motor vehicles aren't allowed *there*, but the rest of the region may allow them. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: motar ratha ho bottu magin** - While boats are mentioned, the text specifically restricts motor vehicles *in the villages*.
*   **C: dumriya ho bottu magin** - This misses the mention of motor vehicles being potentially allowed elsewhere in the region.
*   **D: guvan yanaa ho dumriya magin** - ""Guvan yanaa"" isn't mentioned in the text.



"
ithali padaya 'sink tere' yannen adahas karanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: prapaatha pahak** (cliffside areas).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*shathavarsa gananavak pura, muhudata muhuna laa aethi prapaathavalata kelin ihalin aethi vishama, adhika baevum sahitha bhumibhaagavala minisun visin pravesamen helmalu thanaa aetha.*""  This translates to ""...centuries ago, difficult and steep slopes facing the sea were settled by people who cleverly carved terraces into the land, even with limited space.""

""Prapaatha"" directly refers to cliffs or steep slopes.  The passage explicitly connects ""Sink tere"" (Cinque Terre) to these cliffside areas where people built terraces.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: gammaana pahak (village areas)** - While the villages *are* part of Cinque Terre, the defining characteristic mentioned in the passage is the cliffside location.
*   **B: maarga pahak (road areas)** - Roads are mentioned, but not as the primary characteristic being described.
*   **D: muhudu pahak (sea areas)** - While Cinque Terre is *near* the sea, the passage emphasizes the slopes *facing* the sea, not the sea itself.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, sheetha irthuwe lissana sulu thathwayan sandaha sudusu wanne kumana wargaye boot sapaththu da?","The correct answer is **B: usata pirawu boot sapaththu (boots that resist heat)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a material that is resistant to heat (""seethala ushnathwaye dee drawyaya pramaanavath lesa mrudu viya yuthu ya"" - meaning it doesn't easily soften with cold heat). It also mentions its use in situations involving warm/hot conditions (avasantha sapaththu saamanyayaen ayis saha hima matha lissa yana athara samahara sisira boot sapaththu pavaa adupaadu sahitha wae - referring to warm springs and hot/icy conditions).  Therefore, boots designed to resist heat are the most appropriate choice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: patu vilumba sahitha boot sapaththu (boots with slip resistance):** While the passage mentions friction and avoiding slipping (""saamanyayen gharshanaya waedi kirimata waeli""), heat resistance is the more prominent characteristic described.
*   **C: adi usa vilumba sahitha boots sapaththu (boots with base heat resistance):** The passage doesn't specifically highlight resistance to heat *from the base* of the boot.
*   **D: angal 1/5 ka gaemburu ratawak nomaethi boots sapaththu (boots that don't have a 1/5 inch thick sole):**  The passage mentions the thickness of the sole (5k or 1/5k millimeters) as a characteristic, but it doesn’t define the material based on *not* having that thickness. It's simply a property.



"
sheetha kalaye dee ayis sahitha maargawala karshanaya waedi diyunu kirimata upakaree nowanne mewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: boralu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...saamanyayen gharshanaya waedi kirimata waeli, **boralu** ho lunu (caelciyamm kloriyd) maarga ho maavath matha visuruvaa harinu laebe.""

This translates to: ""...usually used to prevent slipping when friction is reduced, **boralu** or salt (calcium chloride) can be spread on the road or paths.""

Therefore, *boralu* (grit/gravel) is identified as a substance used to improve traction in icy conditions.  The text specifically contrasts it with *lunu* (salt) which also serves the same purpose.



"
hawayi saha kuk doopath athara nishchitha samanakamak aeththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: e dekama kala kalaapaya beda ganee** (They differ in time zones).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hawaay valata samaana kaala kalaapayak sahitha mema dupath samahara avasthaavala dee """"pahala hawaay"""" lesa adahas karay.""  This translates to ""This island collection is referred to as 'Old Hawaii' due to having the same time zones as Hawaii.""

The question asks for a definite similarity between Hawaii and Cook Islands. While they are both island nations, the passage *specifically highlights* the shared time zone as a point of comparison.  The passage doesn't mention whether they differ in hotel resources, political status or city names.

Therefore, C is the best answer based on the information provided.



"
kuk doopath niwaeradiwa visthara nokaranne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: ehi pradhaana nagara wanne raarotonga saha ayitutaki ya** (The main cities here are Rarotonga and Aitutaki).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Cook dupatvala kisindu nagarayak nomaeti namuth vividhaakaara dupath 15 kin saedee aetha. pradhaana eva wanne rarothongaa saha aythuthaki wae.""  This directly translates to ""Cook Islands have no major cities but are made up of 15 diverse islands. The main ones are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eya hawayi walata wadaa kudaayi** (It's close to Hawaii) - While the passage mentions similarities to Hawaii's climate, it doesn't focus on proximity.
* **B: eya doopath samoohayaki** (It's a group of islands) - The passage *does* state it's a group of 15 islands, but this isn't answering what the passage specifically details *about* the Cook Islands.
* **D: mema doopath raajyaya hawayi walata samana kala kalaapayak beda ganee** (This island nation has a similar climate to Hawaii) - Again, it mentions the climate, but isn't the core information about what the Cook Islands *are*.



"
nawathaen vikalpa dekak idiripath karanne pahatha sandahan wana ud‍yaana palaka madyasthaana walin sthaanawalin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: sirenaa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sirinaa hi raeya gathakirima sandahaa obata avasara pathak tibiya yutuya.""  This directly translates to ""Sirenaa is the intermediary of the park who provides vacation permits for the requested dates.""

The other options are mentioned as people who *didn't* have access to vacation permits or were involved in other aspects, but Sirenaa is the one specifically identified as the intermediary for obtaining them.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, obata kredit kadapath wenuwata mudal bhaavitha kirimata awashya nam obata ud‍yaana balapathrayak wen karawa gatha haekke kothaeninda?","The correct answer is **B: puwerto jimenes**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Puverto jimenes hi udyaana paalaka madyasthaanayen rijuvama udyaana avasarapath labaa gaenimata haeki namuth, ovuhu credit card baara ganne naetha."" 

This translates to: ""Puverto Jimenez readily received the park permit as a park administrator, but they didn't have a credit card."" 

The question asks where you should go to get a park permit if you don't have a credit card. The text directly identifies Puverto Jimenez as someone who provided a permit *without* needing a credit card.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, baewum sahitha bhoomiyaka kumana aakaraye skee kreedaawak sidu karanneda?","The correct answer is **A: skee hayiking**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions ""ski tuwaring ho ski hayking lesada haedinve"" (suitable for ski touring or ski hiking).  It then goes on to describe equipment needed for traversing mountainous, snowy terrain – things like boots, powerful skis, and potentially avalanche safety gear. This strongly points to *ski hiking* (or ski touring) as the activity being described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pitisara skee kreedaawa (downhill skiing):** While the passage mentions powerful skis, it focuses on *traveling* across terrain, not just descending it. Downhill skiing usually happens on groomed slopes.
* **C: aelpayin ratawa (alpine travel):** This is too broad. The passage specifically mentions *skiing*.
* **D: skee magin aevida gaman kirima (skiing while traveling):** This is a vague description and doesn't capture the specific nature of the activity as described in the passage.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, ihala wegayakata langaa weemata kaemathi pitisara skee kreedakayinta upakara kala haekke kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: daedi boot sapaththu (sturdy boots)**.

Here's why:

The passage heavily emphasizes the need for appropriate equipment, specifically mentioning ""boot sapaththu awashya we"" (boots are necessary). It details a challenging ski activity in mountainous terrain, requiring strong and reliable footwear.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: bara baekpaek baegayak (a large backpack):** While a backpack might be useful, the passage doesn't *specifically* highlight it as essential for *starting* this ski activity.  It mentions equipment generally, but boots are more directly tied to the immediate physical demands of skiing.
* **C: honda thaththwayan (good technique):** Technique is important for skiing, but the passage focuses on *preparation* – what you *need* before you begin.  This isn't a physical item you acquire.
* **D: pirimaedoo gaman maarga (pre-planned route):**  A planned route is smart, but again, it's about planning, not essential equipment. The passage talks about needing equipment to navigate potentially challenging terrain.



Therefore, **sturdy boots** are the most directly and explicitly mentioned essential item for a beginner in this type of ski activity."
naewatha aethulweeme kampaanaya athvindina sanchaarakayinta apahasu kalayak wanne kumak kirimata da?,"The correct answer is **D: owunge mul sanskruthiyata naewatha anuwarthanaya weema** (continuing to follow one's original culture).

Here's why:

The passage discusses how newcomers (sanchaarakaya) often *abandon* their own culture when adopting a new one. It emphasizes the danger of losing connection to one's roots and suggests that a balanced approach is needed – adopting new ways while still valuing and maintaining one's original culture.  The question asks what the newcomers *reject* when they adopt the new culture.  The passage explicitly states they reject (apahasu viya haekiya) continuing to follow their original culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: nawa sthaanayaka sanskruthiyata anuwarthanaya weema** (following the new local culture) - This is what they *do*, not what they reject.
* **B: iwasillen ha awabodhayen siteema** (being unaware and uneducated) - While lack of awareness is mentioned, it's not the direct rejection described.
* **C: videshayaka sanchaaraya kirima** (doing foreign communication) - This is a general activity, not the specific cultural abandonment discussed.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, naewatha aethulweeme kampaanaya visheshayen dushkara viya haekke kumana aakaraye sanchaarakayekuta da?","The correct answer is **B: videshayaka jiwath wana vita wegawathwa anuwarthanaya wana sanchaarakayinta** (travelers who live abroad and follow separation/isolation).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Videshayaka jivathva sita aapasu nivasata paminena vita, oba nava sanskruthiyata anuvarthanaya wee aethi athara obey maw sanskruthiyen lada obey purudu samaharak naethivi aetha.""  This translates to: ""Living abroad, if they live separately, they can't maintain a connection with their own culture while following a new culture.""  This directly describes the difficulty faced by travelers living abroad who attempt to assimilate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: visheshayen naraka sanskruthika kampaanaya athvindina sanchaarakayin** (travelers experiencing severe cultural shock) - While cultural shock is a *result* of the struggle, the passage focuses on the *reason* for the difficulty - the separation from one's own culture.
* **C: thawamath madhusamaya gatha karana sanchaarakayin** (travelers who spend a short time) - The passage even mentions the difficulty even with a ""long"" (madusama) time period.
* **D: adu iwaseemak aethi sanchaarakayin** (travelers who are uncertain) - Uncertainty might be *part* of the experience, but it's not the core reason for the difficulty described.



Therefore, option B best reflects the central argument of the passage regarding the difficulties faced by travelers in adapting to a new culture while living abroad."
minisun moos sathun samaga sidu kirimen waelakee sitiya yuththe pahatha sandahan karunu walin kawareda?,"The question asks what people do when they encounter moose (elk). The passage (P) states that moose are generally not aggressive but can become dangerous when protecting their young, and people should pay attention to those nearby.

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: owunge paewaethma nosalaka haereema (avoid their offspring)** - This directly relates to the passage's warning about moose protecting their young.  Avoiding their offspring is a sensible precaution.
* **B: itha semin langaa weema (jump over them)** - This is highly unlikely and dangerous.
* **C: owunge vibhavya tharjana mattama awama kirima (observe their potential threats)** - While observation is good, the passage emphasizes *distance* due to potential danger.  ""Potential threats"" isn't the primary concern, it's protecting young.
* **D: dura sita owun nireekshanaya kirima (observe them from a distance)** - This is generally good advice for wildlife, but doesn't specifically address the key danger pointed out in the passage - protecting young.

Therefore, the best answer, based on the passage, is **A: owunge paewaethma nosalaka haereema (avoid their offspring)**.  It directly addresses the specific danger mentioned.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, moos pilibanda sathya nowanne pahatha sandahan prakaasha walin kawareda?","The correct answer is **D: awashya nam owun thamanwama aarakshaa kara ganu aetha** (Definitely, it protects its young).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** states that even though moose aren't usually aggressive, they *will* fiercely defend their calves (thamanwama aarakshaa kara ganithi).  The passage specifically highlights their protective behavior towards their young.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: owun swabhawayen kalahakaree sathun we** (They are naturally aggressive) - The passage explicitly says they are *not* usually aggressive.
* **B: owun samahara vita vibhawa tharjanayak lesa nosaelake** (They don't often attack in herds) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **C: sameepaye sitina pudgalayin visin owun kulappu viya haekiya** (They are feared by people who come close to them) - While the passage *implies* they are feared (because it mentions people avoiding them), it doesn't state this as a direct fact.  The fear stems from their potential to defend their young, not inherent fear of the moose themselves.



Therefore, option D directly reflects the key information presented in the passage."
"mema chedayata anuwa, kaanthara sanchaarakayekuta awama washayen bhayaanaka wanu aeththe pahatha sandahan ewayen kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: seethala raathriyaka unusum aendum nomaethi kama** (because it doesn't get warm at cold nights).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a situation where despite the cold nights, the traveler doesn't feel warmth.** This is because they are severely dehydrated. The lack of fluids prevents their body from regulating temperature properly.  The phrase ""unusum aendum rahithavita sarira ushnathwaya asaamanya lesa aduvima athishaya avadaanamaki"" directly points to this – without warmth, the body temperature drastically decreases, highlighting the issue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: jalaya aethi bawa mulaakara penwana miriguwak daekeema** (the root cause is the lack of water) - While lack of water *is* the root cause, the question asks what makes the nights cold *for the traveler*.  It's not the lack of water directly causing the cold, but the inability to generate warmth due to dehydration.
* **C: miringuwak luhubaenda yamedee shakthiya naasthi kirima** (the traveler doesn't have the energy to warm up) - This is a consequence of dehydration, but not the direct reason for the cold.
* **D: miringuwak luhubaenda yamedee jalaya naasthi kirima** (the traveler doesn't have water to warm up) - This is nonsensical. You don't warm up *with* water.



Therefore, the passage most directly supports the idea that the traveler experiences cold nights because they are unable to warm themselves up."
kaanthara sanchaarakayinta aethi viya haeki tharjanayak sandahan nokaranne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: hayipothermiyawa (hypothermia)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a situation where a traveler is getting very cold, especially at night in a forest.**  It mentions the temperature dropping significantly and the body losing heat rapidly.  This is a clear indication of hypothermia.
* **Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: jala hingaya (dehydration):** While important, the passage focuses on *cold* and heat loss, not lack of water.
    * **B: miringu (rain):** Rain is mentioned, but it's a *cause* of the cold, not the condition the traveler is suffering from.
    * **D: awwata pilisseema (sunstroke):**  Sunstroke is caused by overheating, which is the *opposite* of what's happening in the passage.

* **The question (Q) asks what the traveler is likely suffering from.** Hypothermia directly addresses the symptoms described – feeling extremely cold, body losing heat, and the situation of being in a cold forest environment.



Therefore, **hypothermia (hayipothermiyawa)** is the most logical and accurate answer based on the provided text."
"mema chedaya anuwa, gaweshakayange paemineemen pasu vishaala washayen balapaemata lak wuye kumana janagahana kandaayamada?","The correct answer is **C: Tayino jaathikayan** (Taíno people).

The text states: ""Yuropaa gaveshakayan paemina keti kaalayakata pasuwa, spangna aakramanikayan visin tyno janagahanaya saelakiya yuthu lesa adu karana ladi.""  (When European explorers arrived, Spanish invaders began to diminish the population through warfare).  It also specifically mentions the *Tayino* people (""kaeribvaruya"" referring to the Caribbean people, and earlier stating they spoke Arawakan languages, which the Tayino did) being present *before* the Spanish arrival and thus being the population affected by the invasion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hayiti jaathikayan (Haitian people):**  The text mentions Haiti in relation to the island's division, but doesn't state the original inhabitants were Haitian. Haiti’s current population is a result of later history.
*   **B: Kaeribiyanuwan (Caribbean people):** While the Tayino are *part* of the Caribbean people, the question asks for the specific group diminished by the Spanish, not the broader cultural grouping.
*   **D: Spaangnga jaathikayan (Spanish people):**  The Spanish were the invaders, not the invaded population.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, kaereebiyanuwan visin katha karana lada bhaashawa kumakda?","The correct answer is **D: arawakan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""kaeribvaruya. kaeribvaru kri.poo 10,000 dee pamana paemini aravakan basa kathaa karana jana kotthaashayak vuha.""  This translates to ""Caribbean. The Caribbean had many groups of people who spoke the Arawakan language about 10,000 years ago.""

Therefore, the language spoken by the Caribbean people mentioned in the text is Arawakan.

vinodathmaka kriyaakaarakamak lesa skee kreedaawa janapriya kirima pilibandawa gawrawaya laebiya yuththe katada?,"The correct answer is **B: norwejiyanuwan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...1861 dee norvijiyaanuvan visin ostreliyaave dee vinoda kreedaawak lesa hima matha lissime palamuwana samaajaya vivurta karana ladi.""  This translates to ""...in 1861, Norwegians introduced ski jumping as a recreational sport in Australia, opening up society.""

Therefore, Norwegians were instrumental in popularizing ski jumping as a recreational activity. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: skee bams** - This refers to ski booms (likely a technique or style), not the people who popularized the sport.
*   **C: guhaa waesiyan** -  This translates to ""cave dwellers"" and has no relevance to the passage.
*   **D: ostreliyanuwan** - While Australians *received* the sport, they didn't *introduce* it; the Norwegians did.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, skee kreedaawa kreedaawak lesa mulinma piliganu laebuwe kumana kalayedee da?","The correct answer is **D: 17 wana siyawasa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""kande sita pahalata hima matha lissaa yaama kreedaawak lesa **17 wana siyavasa** dakwaawath diva yana athara...""  This directly answers the question of when ski kreeda was introduced as a sport.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 18 wana siyawasa:** The passage specifically mentions 17, not 18.
*   **B: kri.poo 5000:** This refers to a length of time/a figure and isn't related to the introduction of the sport.
*   **C: 1861:**  While 1861 is mentioned, it refers to the year Norwegians began enjoying skiing in Australia, not the initial introduction of the sport as a competition.

naegenahira aprikaanu werala theeraye vishaalathama doopatha ha sambandha wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: yuropeeya balapaema (European colonialism)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yuropiya balapaema saha yatathvijita kireema aarambha vuye 15 wana siyavase pruthugeesi gaveshaka vasko da gaamaa visin yuropaye sita indiyaavata yaamata caep maargaya soyaa gaenimath samaga ya.""  This directly translates to ""European colonialism and the beginning of competitive trade in the 15th century, the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route to India, bringing Europe into contact with the East.""

The question asks about what connected the large islands off the coast of Africa. The passage details how European power (specifically Portuguese exploration) was the catalyst for this connection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: islaam dahama (Islam):** While Islam is mentioned as being present in certain areas, it's not the primary driver of connection described in the passage.
*   **C: wana jiween (Wildlife):** The passage mentions wildlife but not as a connecting factor.
*   **D: sukhopabhogee werala nikethana (Luxurious settlements):**  These are a *result* of connection, not the connection itself.



"

* **The passage states:** ""Ithaa kudaa dupath bahutarayak svaadhina jaathin ho pranshaya samaga ek woo, saha **sukhopabhogi verala nikethana lesa handunvanu laebae**.""  This directly translates to ""It also had many independent tribes or provinces, and was sought after as a luxurious and comfortable dwelling.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: pranshaya samaga sambandhathawaya (relation with provinces):** While the passage mentions provinces, it doesn't highlight this as a *defining* characteristic.
* **C: wana jiween sandaha prasiddhiyak (famous for forest life):** The passage mentions Madagascar being a large island with unique wildlife, but doesn't position this as the primary distinguishing feature of the African islands.
* **D: wenath ratawalin swadheena weema (independent from Asian countries):** The passage talks about trade routes *to* Asia, but doesn't emphasize independence *from* Asia.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Boho sampradhaaika palli boho vita paasku sathi anthaye senasurada raathriye paasku uthsavayak pawathwana athara..."" which translates to ""Many traditional churches celebrate the Easter festival especially on the silent night of the guards..."".  This directly links the Easter celebration to being remembered on that specific night.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sarubhawaya pilibandawa chaarithrayak paewaethweema** (Stories about sacrifice are received) - While sacrifice is *related* to Easter, the passage doesn't highlight this as a defining characteristic of *how* it's remembered.
*   **C: sabhawa sandaha wasantha sadayak paewaethweema** (Assemblies and spring days are received) - The passage mentions spring (vasantha) as part of the historical context, but not as a central element of the remembrance.
*   **D: hiru udaawa naerabima** (Shining of the sun) - The passage mentions ""hiru udaawa"" (sun) in a different context, as part of the tradition, but it's not the specific time or event the passage focuses on for remembrance.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Obage gaman balapatraya, sanchaaraya karana dinavalin obbata maasa 6 ka kaalayak dakwawath valangu viya yuthu ya.""  This translates directly to needing a travel document valid for at least 6 months from the date of travel.

* **C: raendee sitina kalaya sanaatha kirima sandaha yana ena idiriyata aethi gaman tikath pathak** (return ticket showing a date for return travel) - Also mentioned, but a requirement *in addition to* the passport/travel document.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Obage gaman balapatraya, sanchaaraya karana dinavalin obbata maasa 6 ka kaalayak dakwawath valangu viya yuthu ya."" This translates to ""Your passport, for travel days, must be valid for at least 6 months.""  It also mentions needing a travel ticket. This directly relates to the requirements for foreign travel documents.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sanchaarakayinge sankyawa awama mattamaka thaba gaeneema** (being able to count the days of travel) - While travel planning is involved, it's not the core *requirement*.
* **B: sanvidhaanaathmaka sankramana prawahayak pawathwa gaeneema** (understanding constitutional transition processes) - Completely irrelevant to travel requirements.

thama ratata wadaa videsheeya rataka waedi piriwaeyak daereemata siduwanu aeththe pahatha sandahan dae athurin kumak sandahada?,"The passage (P) discusses the benefits of a country importing technology (specifically mentioning lenses/optics - ""kannaadi vadaa"") from foreign countries, especially in areas where domestic production is lacking. It highlights how this can lead to advancements and ultimately benefit the nation.  It also mentions the importance of research (""pariksaavak sidu karagena"") and adaptation (""anukarana viya haekiya"").

The question (Q) asks what is a likely immediate benefit of importing technology from foreign countries.

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: akshi pareekshana (eye testing)** - While improved optics *could* lead to better eye testing, it's not the *immediate* result of importing the technology.
* **B: usas pele kannaadi raamu (hot glass lenses)** - This is related to the technology, but doesn't represent a benefit *to the country*. It's a component.
* **C: drushti rakshanaya (vision protection)** - Again, a potential *long-term* benefit, but not the direct, immediate impact.
* **D: welanda sannam nowana raamu (new glass frames/spectacles)** - This is the most direct and immediate benefit. Importing lens technology allows for the production or availability of better spectacles and frames, directly improving vision for people.  The passage mentions the benefits being felt by those needing glasses (""tibiya haekiya"").

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: welanda sannam nowana raamu**.



"
videsheeya rataka usas pele kannaadi raamu miladee gaeneeme avadaanamak viya haekke kumakda?,"Let's break down the passage (P) and the question (Q) to find the best answer.

**Understanding the Passage (P):**

The passage talks about foreign investment and its benefits to a country.  It highlights that investment, especially in protective/security industries, can lead to economic gains.  It mentions needing to carefully examine investments (like conducting thorough inspections), and that imitating others (following successful models) and being truthful are crucial for a country to reap the full benefits.  It also hints at potential dangers or drawbacks if things aren't done correctly – comparing it to a ""glass ram"" that breaks easily if not handled well.

**Understanding the Question (Q):**

The question asks: ""What is the implication of foreign investment being like a 'glass ram'?""  It's asking about the *risk* or *caution* associated with this analogy.

**Analyzing the Answer Options:**

* **A: athireka akshi pareekshanayak awashya viya haekiya (extra eye examination is necessary):** This aligns with the passage's emphasis on careful inspection (""nivasedi aes pariksaavak sidu karagena""). The ""glass ram"" is fragile, so you need to examine it closely. This is a *strong* contender.

* **B: samahara raamu sandaha vaid‍ya niyama kirim walangu noviya haekiya (the whole ram doesn’t follow legal rules):** This doesn't connect to the ""glass ram"" analogy. The issue isn't about legality, but fragility.

* **C: ewa vyaaja ewa viya haekiya (it's just a trick/illusion):** While the passage mentions truthfulness, this option doesn't directly relate to the fragility implied by the ""glass ram.""

* **D: rakshanaya piriwaeya aawaranaya nokaranu aetha (don't cover protective industries):** This is the *opposite* of what the passage suggests.  The passage indicates protective industries are *good* for investment.



**Conclusion:**

The best answer is **A: athireka akshi pareekshanayak awashya viya haekiya**.  The analogy of the ""glass ram"" signifies fragility and the need for careful handling and thorough examination (inspection) to avoid it breaking. This directly mirrors the passage's point about carefully vetting foreign investments.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Dupatvala onaema thaenaka brithaanya pavum piligannaa athara, staenly thula boho vita kredit kaad saha aemerikaanu dollar da piliganu labai."" (The value of the Falkland Islands currency is affected by the British pound, credit ratings, and the US dollar).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: eksath janapada dolaraya piligannaa ekama sthaanaya staenli pamani** (the US dollar is the only place to exchange the Stanley currency) - The passage mentions the US dollar *alongside* credit ratings and the British pound, not as the sole factor.
* **C: doopath walin pitathweemen pasu fokland pawum huwamaru kara gatha yuthuya** (strategies to convert Falkland pounds) - The passage discusses factors *affecting* the value, not conversion strategies.
* **D: fokland pawuma haerunu vita brithan‍ya pawuma saaman‍yayen wadaathma piligath mudal we** (funds are invested equally in Falkland and British pounds) - This isn't mentioned in the passage at all.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate reflection of the information provided in the text.

Here's why, based on the provided text (which is in Sinhala and describes a financial situation related to the Falkland Islands):

* **The passage discusses a depreciation of the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP) against the British Pound (GBP).** It highlights concerns about potential economic instability.
* **It mentions credit cards and US dollar transactions being affected.**  This suggests a need for alternative financial arrangements.
* **The key point is the vulnerability to fluctuations and the need for diversification.** The passage implies exploring options to avoid relying solely on the British Pound and the existing banking system.
* **""Siyaluma Doopath Wala"" (All Islands)** represents a broader diversification strategy – looking beyond just the Falklands and potentially utilizing financial resources from other island nations or a wider range of currencies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: batahira FIC welandasaela (FIC West Velandasela)** - This refers to a specific banking entity mentioned in the text, but doesn't represent a broader strategic solution.
* **C: pitasthara doopath wala (Pitasthara Doopath Wala)** - This isn't mentioned in the text, and is likely a distractor.
* **D: staenli puraawata (Stanley Purawata)** - Stanley is the capital of the Falkland Islands, so focusing solely on it wouldn't address the core issue of financial vulnerability and diversification.



Therefore, the passage strongly suggests the need for a more diversified approach, making **""Siyaluma Doopath Wala""** the most appropriate answer."
kovile uthsawa samayata adala nowanne koyi awasthaawada?,"The correct answer is **D: dewasthaanayata sambandha pradhaana siduweem** (things primarily related to the temple).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the temple's annual festival.** It describes preparations, processions, music, and special observances *within the context of the temple*.  The whole text revolves around the temple and its celebrations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aliyekuge upatha (attendance of people):** While people attend the festival, the passage doesn't primarily *focus* on the attendees themselves.
* **B: kovile sanwathsaraya (temple's history):** The passage doesn't discuss the history of the temple. It's about a current event - the festival.
* **C: dewathaviyakage upandinaya (arrival of deities):** The arrival of deities is *part* of the festival, but the passage describes a wider range of activities than just that. It's about the whole festival, not just the deity's arrival.



Therefore, **D** is the most encompassing and accurate description of what the passage is about."
saerasili kara aethi ali aethun naerabimata haekke kothaenada?,"The correct answer is **D: keralaye weediwala**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Saerasili kala ali aetun sahitha deergha perahaerak, devasthaana waadya vrundaya saha wenath uthsavaanga sahitha **keralayehi** devasthaana uthsava naerambimata itha sithgannaa deyaki.""  This translates to ""Long processions with colorful flags, the temple musical troupe, and festival participants are seen **through the streets of Kerala** during the temple festival.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: nowaembar aga sita maeyi maeda dakwa saema thaenakama** - This refers to the time of the festival, not *where* the processions take place.
* **B: kovil wala** - While the festival is *at* the temple, the processions specifically go through the streets.
* **C: pansal uthsawa perahaera waladee** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.

"mema chedayata anuwa, vyaapara ho palamu panthiye prawesha pathrawala mudal ithiri kara gaeneemata boho durata ida aeththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: obe samaagama haraha eya viyadam kirima**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the futility of entering business or a new path without proper foundation and guidance.** It states that without a strong base (like a good community/connection - ""obe samaagama""), efforts will be fruitless.
* The passage directly mentions needing someone to *show* you the way (""danna athara eyata anukulava ayakirima sidukarayi"") - implying reliance on someone within your circle.
* Options B, C, and D focus on the *path* itself (entering business, new directions, wasted effort). The passage's core message is about the *source of guidance* needed *before* embarking on a path.

Therefore, **""obe samaagama haraha eya viyadam kirima"" (it is necessary to understand it through your community)** best reflects the passage's central argument.

"mema chedayata anuwa, yam panthi gaasthu wenkarawa gaeneem pilibanda seweemedee kalaya naasthi kirimak wanuye kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: vyaapara panthiya**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the ""vyaapara panthiya"" (business path) is not profitable, offering only a few advantages compared to the ""palamu panthiya"" (first path).  It describes the business path as leading to fruitless activities. The question asks which path is *not* advantageous.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: riju guvan gaman:** This refers to a straightforward journey, mentioned briefly as unproductive. It isn't the *main* focus of the disadvantage described.
*   **C: wattam:**  This simply refers to a ""circle"" or cycle, and isn't presented as a path with inherent disadvantages.
*   **D: palamu panthiya:** The passage actually presents this path as *more* advantageous than the business path.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""aprikaaava wetha wana obage mulu gaasthu mila ganan lowa pura gaastuva samaga saesandena aakaraya balanna."" (You should approach the relevant authorities with your property details when traveling to Africa).  It then continues by listing things like residence permits, citizenship, and land ownership as things that might be required.  The most direct connection to needing to show property details is getting a residence permit *based on* that property.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: aprikaave pitathweeme badu piriwaeya** (Obtaining citizenship) - While mentioned, the passage doesn’t directly link property details to *getting* citizenship.
* **C: aprikaanu visaa balapathrayaka piriwaeya** (Obtaining a visa) -  The passage talks about needing potentially *more* than just a visa (like a residence permit) once you are in Africa.
* **D: aprikaave pitatha sthaana sandaha bhoomi pravaahana piriwaeya** (Obtaining land ownership) - The passage assumes you *already* own the property; it's about what to do *with* that ownership when traveling.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of planned, well-thought-out meals (""soodaanam kala aahara"") for optimal health and avoiding nutritional deficiencies.** It states that diverse foods prepared with knowledge are beneficial.
* The other options are mentioned as *results* or *components* of good nutrition, but not the core *method* discussed:
    * **B: mayikrowew udun** (using a microwave) - is a cooking method, not a dietary approach.
    * **C: e-thulama aethi awanhal** (electronic scales) - are tools for measuring, not the planning itself.
    * **D: daeriya haeki mila** (dairy milk) - is a specific food item, not a complete dietary strategy.

The question asks for the method to obtain diverse nutritional benefits, and the passage clearly points to *planned food preparation* as the key.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Supiri velaendasaelvala vividhaakara lesa soodaanam kala aahara  waedi vaediyen ganimin pawathee."" (A diverse intake of food is beneficial for good health.)  This directly links good health to eating a variety of foods.
* **The question asks:** What is the benefit gained from a nutritious food intake, particularly for good health?

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: e-thulama aethi awanhal (this balance is not present)** - While balance is *implied* as important (avoiding excess), the passage doesn't explicitly state that *lack* of balance is the benefit.
* **C: amu aahara (this food)** -  Too vague. The passage focuses on the *type* of intake, not a single food.
* **D: mayikrowew udunak (due to microbes)** -  The passage mentions microbes affecting digestion, but doesn't say this is the *benefit* of nutritious food.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage."

Here's why:

The passage repeatedly emphasizes the difficulty in understanding French spoken by Belgians and Swiss people due to variations in pronunciation and vocabulary. It specifically asks if you can understand *their* accepted system of French notation (writing/spelling). The passage implies they use a standardized written form even if their spoken French differs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: suvisheshee pransha wachana** (special French reading) - While pronunciation is the core issue, the passage isn't about a special *way of reading* French, but rather how they *speak* it.
* **C: pransha wachanawala aethaem uchchaarana** (French reading with etymological pronunciation) - This is too specific and doesn't capture the broad communication issue described in the text.  It's about everyday speech, not historical pronunciation.
* **D: pranshaye waedipurama katha karana pransha bhaashawa** (French spoken throughout France) - The passage explicitly contrasts French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland *with* French spoken in France.

This translates to: ""...the way of writing the French language spoken in Belgium and Switzerland is very unusual compared to the way of speaking the French language, and their pronunciations are very different.""

The question asks what distinguishes French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland. The passage *directly* points to differences in pronunciation (""wachana uchcharanaya"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ankana kramaya (writing system):** While the passage mentions the writing system is different, it emphasizes pronunciation as the main distinction.
* **C: pasalwala uganwanu labana sammatha pransha bhaashawa (accepted French language for school use):** The passage mentions acceptance by the people, but doesn’t state that the school language differs.
* **D: samahara pransha wachanawala akshara vin‍yasaya (some French vocabulary character arrangement):** This is too specific and not the main point of the passage.

viyo guvan gaasthuwak laba gaeneemata obata nohaeki wanne kumana awasthaawedee da?,"The correct answer is **D: oba delta samaga piyasara karanne nam** (If you are traveling with Delta).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Meva labaadena guvan samaagam athara eya kaenada, delta eyalains, eksath janapadayen ho kaenadaawen aarambha wana lufthaansa, saha westjet aetulat we."" This translates to ""Without this, the group travel is either Canada, Delta Airlines, United States or Canada starting Lufthansa and Westjet.""  The passage then asks about a situation where you *don't* get a group discount.  The context suggests the discount applies if you're traveling with Delta, Lufthansa, or Westjet. Therefore, *not* getting the discount implies you are *not* traveling with those airlines.

Option D directly addresses that - it asks if you are traveling with Delta. Since the passage connects the discount to Delta, this is the logical answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: oba westjet samaga piyasara karanne nam** - Westjet *is* mentioned as an airline where the discount *would* apply.
* **B: thewana parshweeya sewaawak wenuwata oba guvan samaagama samaga rijuwama wenkarawa gaeneemata uthsaha karanne nam** - This is irrelevant to the information provided.
* **C: oba lufthansa guvan yaanayakin paerisiye sita eksath janapadayata piyasara karanne nam** - Lufthansa *is* mentioned as an airline where the discount *would* apply.

* **The passage states:** ""Thawamath guvan samaagam kihipayak pamanak avasan avasthaave avamangalya gamanaagamana pirivaeya sandaha sulu vattam labaadena, viyo guvan gaasthu labaadhe.""  This directly translates to: ""Due to the difficulty of finding a suitable time for the passenger gathering, a period of unfavorable travel has arisen, and the passenger fare cannot be found.""

The question asks about the truth regarding the passenger fare. The passage clearly links the unavailability of the fare to this ""period of unfavorable travel.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage mentions difficulty with communication, but doesn't say it *caused* the fare issue.
* **C:** The passage discusses travel periods, not a specific ending point of travel.
* **D:** Similar to B, it mentions communication challenges, but not as the direct cause of the fare problem.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) emphasizes understanding the data your GPS provides about *your* vehicle.** It mentions needing to know how it relates to your vehicle, how to interpret the information, and how it affects your driving.  The core issue is understanding the connection between the GPS data and the physical reality of your vehicle and driving situation.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: oba mudal ithiri kirimata uthsaha karana vita** (You are motivated to start first) - This is irrelevant to the passage's focus on *understanding* GPS data.
* **C: oba sanngaa paraasayen pitathata yana vita** (You go relying on others) - The passage suggests *not* relying on others, but understanding the data *yourself*.
* **D: obata upaangayak kuliyata gaeneemata awashya naethi vita** (You don't need to collect tools) - This is about the *tools* of GPS, not the *understanding* of the data.



**Therefore, option B directly addresses the central concern of the passage: knowing and understanding the data related to your vehicle that the GPS provides.**"
thani upakaranayakata sapekshawa jipeees sanchaalana yeduma bhaavitha kirimata honda hethuwak nowanne kumak da?,"The question asks for the best reason why GPS operation might be affected when driving a smart vehicle. Let's break down the original paragraph:

* **The paragraph describes a situation where GPS works perfectly normally in open areas but has trouble in tunnels.** It mentions starting with a good signal, then losing it in a tunnel, and needing to re-acquire it.  It also points out that the vehicle's systems don't seem to *understand* they are in a tunnel and continue trying to use GPS.

Now let's analyze the options:

* **A: daththa sambandhathawayak pilibanda karadara viya yuthu naetha (There's no data regarding sensor relationships)** - This is too vague and doesn't directly address the problem described. The problem isn't *about* sensor relationships, it's about GPS signal loss.
* **B: mudal ithiri kirima (Starting initially)** -  Starting with a signal isn't the *reason* for the problem; it highlights the contrast when the signal *is* lost.
* **C: kuliyata gaeneemen waelakee siteema (Limitation of signal reception)** -  This is the **most accurate answer.**  The paragraph directly describes the loss of GPS signal *due to* being in a tunnel, meaning limited signal reception.  Tunnels block the GPS signals.
* **D: nawa sithiyam miladee gaeneemata awashya noweema (Not needing to receive a new system signal)** - This is incorrect. The vehicle *needs* to re-acquire the signal *after* losing it in the tunnel.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C**.



**Final Answer: C**"
mema chedayata anuwa obata wadaathma yogya nawkawak samaga gaelapena bawa sahathika kala haekke keseda?,"The correct answer is **C: galapagos sanchaara visheshangayeku haraha wen karawa gaeneema** (I can assist with a special Galapagos tour).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on Galapagos travel.** The entire text describes a journey to the Galapagos Islands, details about boats, and the need for specialized knowledge of the islands.
* **The question asks what assistance is offered.** The passage implies the speaker can help *because* of their knowledge of the Galapagos.
* **Option C directly relates to this.** It offers help with a *special Galapagos tour*, fitting the context perfectly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: samaana unanduwak aethi mageen 8 kata wadaa pirisakata kandaayamak lesa wenkarawa gaeneema** (I can help with general inquiries and provide information about 8-100 day trips) - While the passage mentions trip durations, it's not the *main* focus of the offer.
* **B: adu senangak aethi samaya thula wenkarawa gaeneema** (I can help with comfortable and timely travel) - This is too general and doesn't leverage the specific knowledge mentioned in the passage.
* **D: kalthiya wenkarawa gaeneema** (I can help with calculations) -  The passage mentions calculations regarding boat capacity, but this isn't the assistance being offered.

"mema chedayata anuwa, aaganthukayan sooduwa digatama karagena yamata ida salasana upaya maargayak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: nomile sangeetha prasanga praweshapath waeni diri deemanaa** (introducing a subtle musical ambience).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes creating a welcoming atmosphere for visitors.** It mentions things like comfortable seating, special food and drink, and a generally pleasant experience. The goal is to make them feel at ease and encourage them to stay longer.
* **Option B directly addresses this.** Subtle music creates a relaxing and inviting atmosphere.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: swabhavika aalokaye bahulathwaya (abundance of natural light)** - While natural light is nice, it's not specifically mentioned as a key element in the passage's description of making guests feel welcome.
    * **C: nomile mad‍yasara beema (subtle alcohol provision)** - The passage actually *warns* about the negative consequences of excessive alcohol consumption (""samahara thaenvala eyinma madyasaara beema pirinamana athara"").
    * **D: oralosu nomaethi weema (providing a variety of snacks)** - This is mentioned, but it's only *one* part of the overall strategy described. The passage focuses on the *feeling* created, not just the things provided.

Therefore, a subtle musical ambience is the most appropriate way to enhance the welcoming atmosphere described in the passage.



"
"ema chedayata anuwa, daksha soodukaruweku walakwa gatha yuththe kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: adhika lesa mathpaen paanaya kirima** (drinking excessively/getting drunk).

Here's why:

The passage (P) describes visitors who are enthusiastic about spending time and money, often consuming special foods, drinks, and enjoying themselves. It then mentions that *some* of these visitors experience negative consequences from alcohol. The phrase ""kese vethath, beemath bhava vichaara buddhiya mota karana athara ma, daksha sudukaruvan beemath nowee siteeme vaedagathkama hondin danee"" directly points to skilled fraudsters taking advantage of people when they are drunk.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: onaema dirigaenweemak piligaeneema (being tested for illnesses):**  The passage doesn't mention medical testing.
* **C: oralosu ho ath oralosu pareekshaa kara baeleema (testing one or two things):**  This isn't connected to the mention of fraudsters and alcohol.
* **D: aasannathama pitaweema gaena vimasilimathwa siteema (getting a position by approaching fathers):** This is irrelevant to the context of the passage.



Therefore, the most logical connection to the passage's description of unscrupulous individuals exploiting intoxicated visitors is excessive drinking."
"mema chedayata anuwa, waak‍yayaka maeda kaepital akurin liyawena wachana panthiya kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: naama pada** (noun).

Here's why:

The passage (P) states that the capital letter starts with *nouns* in sentences. It specifically mentions that complex sentences can be formed by adding action verbs (kriyaapada) and objects (karma) *to* these nouns.  The passage focuses on nouns as the foundational element for sentence structure and capitalization.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kriyaa pada (verb):** While verbs are important, the passage explicitly says the capital letter starts with a *noun*.
* **C: naama visheshana pada (adjective):** Adjectives describe nouns, but the passage doesn't state they are the starting point for capitalization.
* **D: kriyaa visheshana pada (adverb):** Adverbs modify verbs, and the passage doesn't connect them to the initial capitalization rule.

Therefore, the question asks about what the capital letter in a sentence's beginning indicates, and the passage clearly indicates it's a **noun (naama pada)**.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, naama padayak kaepital akurin liweema magin wadaath apahasu wanne kumak da?","The correct answer is **A: kiyaweema**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses how a noun (naamapada) can be used to *do* something (like a verb) within a capital account.** It highlights how nouns can take on active roles and become subject to complex accounting treatments.
* **""Kiyaweema"" (doing/action) directly relates to this concept.** The passage is explaining how a noun *acts* or *performs* a function within the capital account, effectively behaving like a verb.
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **B: kriyaa pada athara wenasa handunaa gaeneema (being subject to verbs or actions)** - This is the opposite of what the passage describes. The *noun* is becoming like a verb.
    * **C: liweema (accounting)** - While accounting is the *context*, it's not what the noun is *doing*.
    * **D: wasthun athara wenasa handunaa gaeneema (being subject to things/objects)** - This doesn't capture the dynamic, action-oriented shift described in the passage.

Therefore, **A: kiyaweema** is the most accurate answer, as it represents the core idea of a noun taking on the role of an action.



"
"maelesiyawe graameeya pradeshawala, “enna” yanna adahas karanne kumana abhinaya magin da?","The correct answer is **A: dabaraengilla naemeema**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...grameeya pradeshawalawath maelaevarun athara ho, in pavasanne """"mehi enna"""" yanna wana athara, dabara aegilla sirura desata naemeema magin prakaasha kerena..."" 

This translates to: ""...those who travel from rural areas, those who use 'enna' in this season, illuminate the country with the fragrance of 'dabara aegilla'...""

Therefore, ""dabara aegilla"" is the fragrance associated with using ""enna"" in rural areas.  The question asks what fragrance is used when applying ""enna"" in rural areas, and the passage directly links it to ""dabara aegilla naemeema"".



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, “aapasu enna” yanna adahas karanne kumana abhinaya maginda?","The correct answer is **A: athla thaman desata harawa atha waeneema**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...spaangnaye dee brithaanya sanchaarakayeku, samu gaenimedi thaman desata athla haravagena karana atha waeneema...""  This translates to ""...a Spanish or British traveler, doing something that would cause them to get lost in the country...""  This directly relates to getting lost (""athla thaman desata harawa atha waeneema"").

The other options are incorrect as they are unrelated to the context of getting lost or the traveler's actions described in the passage.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, irithaeleem walata hethu wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: hima paalam** (ice bridge).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""memagin hima paalam valin saengavi giya iritaeleem..."" which translates to ""I crossed the iritaeleem using the ice bridge..."" This directly links the iritaeleem to being crossed *because of* the ice bridge.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: asthaayee glaesiyara** (temporary glacier): While the passage describes a glacier, it doesn't say the iritaeleem is *because of* a temporary glacier.
*   **C: ayis guhaa kadaa waeteema** (in the ice cave): The passage mentions an ice cave, but it doesn't relate to why the iritaeleem was crossed.
*   **D: lihil kutti** (small cutting/hole): The passage mentions a ""vishaala kutti"" (large cutting/hole) in the glacier but not as a reason for crossing the iritaeleem.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, hima paalamen saengaviya haekke kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: irithaeleem**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""memagin hima paalam valin saengavi giya iritaeleem"" which translates to ""the irithaeleem that was carried away by the ice bridge"".  The question asks what was carried away by the ice bridge. Therefore, *irithaeleem* is the correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ayis guhaa** (Ayis' cave) - The passage mentions this, but doesn't say it was carried by the ice bridge.
* **C: biththi** (hole) - Similar to the cave, it's mentioned but not linked to the ice bridge.
* **D: vishaala kutti** (large family) -  This refers to a large group of people, not something physically carried.

"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, sanchaarakayin kumana sthaanayata paemineemata pera amathara poorwarakshaka piyawara gatha yuthuda?","The correct answer is **A: nayiragongo gini kanda** (Nyragongo volcano).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""2002 dee nayiraegongo gini kande lava hetuven gomaa nagaraya vinasha woo athara..."" (In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed due to the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano...).  The question asks where the conflict/disaster that prompted the need for security forces originated.  The volcano is the clear source.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: gomaa wataa aethi pradeshayan** (Goma's surrounding area) - This is *affected* by the volcano, but isn't the origin of the conflict.
* **C: nagara madhyaya** (city center) - This is where the destruction happened, but not the *cause*.
* **D: ruwandaawa** (Rwanda) - While Rwanda is mentioned in relation to Goma, the source of the problem is the volcano.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses heavily on the impact of the Nyiragongo volcano on Goma.** It explicitly states the city was devastated by lava flows from the volcano in 2002. The entire description revolves around this event and its consequences. The question asks for what Goma is known for as a transportation hub.  The volcanic activity is the defining characteristic mentioned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: uthuru kiwu hi satan itha sithgannaa sulu ya** (beautiful scenery in North Kivu) - While North Kivu might be beautiful, the passage doesn't highlight this as a defining feature of Goma as a transportation hub.
* **B: daeriya haeki kandukara gorillaa luhubaendeema sandaha eya honda sthaanayaki** (a good place to see mountain gorillas) -  While the passage *mentions* gorillas, it's in the context of the region, not as a reason to travel *to* Goma itself.
* **C: yathurupaedi kulee ratha yanu gaman kirimata honda kramayaki** (a good way to travel by motorcycle taxi) -  The mention of ""boda-bodas"" (motorcycle taxis) is just a detail about getting around *within* the city, not why people would choose Goma as a destination.



Therefore, the most relevant and accurate answer based on the provided text is that Goma is known as a transportation hub *because* it's a city affected by the Nyiragongo volcano, which makes its location and situation unique."
agosthu maasaye wana aarambhaka dinaya sandaha pradesheeya awasara pathak laba gatha haekiwanu aeththe kawadada?,"The correct answer is **C: maeyi 1 wana da** (May 1st).

Here's the reasoning, based on the provided text:

The text states: ""Melesa, maeyi maasaye onaema aarambhaka dinayak sandaha wana praadeshiya avasara pathak janavari 1 wanada sita labaagata haeki ya."" 

This translates to: ""Moreover, the regional allowance received from the 1st of May is considered as received from January 1st.""

Therefore, the regional allowance starting on May 1st is *considered* as being received from January 1st for some purpose (likely accounting/budgeting).  The question asks about *when* the allowance *starts* being received, and the text clearly states May 1st.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""hadisi illim sandaha seemitha sankhyawak sandaha avasara labaa dee atha"" which translates to ""however, a limited number of vacation days are granted.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: palamuwa paemini ayata palamuwa awasarapath laba deeme kriyawaliya** (procedures for receiving vacation when submitting an application) - While the passage mentions submitting an application, it doesn't focus on the *procedure* itself.
* **B: awasara path laba gatha haekke janawaari 1 wana dina pamani** (the date vacation is received is January 1st) - This is a specific example given in the passage, but doesn't represent the *general* principle of vacation allowance.
* **C: awasara path laba gatha haekke pudgalikawa paemina ayadum kirima haraha pamani** (the conditions under which vacation is received when submitted by individuals) - Similar to A, it's about conditions, not the core allowance.

**Therefore, the passage's main point regarding the practical aspect of vacation allowance is that it's limited in number.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the Samahara hotel as attracting ""ekala dhanavat ha prasiddha pudgalayinta navaathaen gaenimata wana athara""** - meaning it attracts wealthy and famous people. This is the core characteristic highlighted in the description.
* The question asks what the hotel is known for.  Attracting a high-profile clientele is its defining feature.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: koktel baar ekak (a cocktail bar):** While the hotel likely *has* a cocktail bar, it's not what the passage emphasizes as its key characteristic.
* **B: ema sthaanayema aethi gormut awanhalak (there aren't many rooms in this place):** The passage doesn't mention room quantity.
* **D: naweena waedidiyunu kirim sahitha maethakadee naweekaranaya karana lada kamara (rooms doing renovations with new beds):** The passage mentions renovation and new comforts but doesn’t focus on this as its main draw.

"mema chedaye dakwa aethi thorathuru walata anuwa, hotal aaganthukayan awama pramukhathawaya deemata ida aeththe pahatha sandahan pirinaemeem walin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: raathree vinodaswadaya laba dena viwekagarayak** (a place to enjoy nightly entertainment).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the Samahara hotel as a place offering ""boho vita shobana bhojana saha raathri sada paewathini"" (abundant, beautiful food and nightly entertainment).** This is a key feature highlighted in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: hotalaya puraawatama pawuraanika gruha bhaanda (ancient household items in the hotel)** - While the hotel *might* have some antique elements, the passage doesn't emphasize them. It focuses on luxury and entertainment.
* **B: keerthimath supawediyaku samaga awanhalak (a gathering place for famous, well-respected people)** - The passage mentions the hotel attracts wealthy and prominent individuals, but it doesn't define the *purpose* of the hotel as a gathering place for them.  It's a *result* of the hotel's quality, not its primary function.
* **D: daeriya haeki kaamara gaasthu (a cramped and uncomfortable guest house)** - This is the *opposite* of the description in the passage, which paints the hotel as luxurious and spacious.



Therefore, option C best captures the essence of what the passage reveals about the Samahara hotel."

Here's why:

The passage discusses the importance of WiFi and internet access in hotels (""Obey hotelaye ho satkaarakayan...bohovita wifi sambandhataavayak ho antharjaalayata sambandha woo pariganakayak tibiya yuthu athara, siyalu janaavasavala antharjaala avanhalak ho podu wifi sthaanayak atha."").  It implies that people rely on internet connectivity, and the lack of it would be a significant drawback (""durwala viya haeki"").  The passage then details how the word ""Eskimo"" is considered offensive by Greenlandic people, referencing communication and perception.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ihala aparaadha anupathayan sandaha prasiddha samahara pradesha** - This relates to crime and areas of suspicion, not communication.
* **B: awurudda puraa deshagunaya saaman‍yayen unusum wana baevin bara aendum raegena ema** - This discusses climate and clothing, not communication.
* **D: ""greenlanthaye swadeshikayeku""""eskimo"""" lesa ha"

The passage states: ""Sarath irtuve digu dina nisaa pramaanavat nindak labyma pilibanda gaetalu saha e samaga baedhunu soukya gaetalu aethiviya haeki ya. Sarath irtuvedi, **nodik maduruvan** kerehi da avadhaanaya yomu karanna."" 

This translates to: ""There are discussions about the availability of proof for the three-day night during the winter solstice and related health discussions. Sarath inquired, paying attention to **Nordic doctors**.""

The question asks what kind of discussions are had with people going to Greenland. The passage explicitly mentions discussions with Nordic doctors regarding health concerns related to Greenland's climate and conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: aparaadha (offense/crime)** - The passage mentions offenses are uncommon in Greenland, but doesn't tie them to discussions with travelers.
*   **C: kaalagunaya (climate)** - While the climate is *discussed*, it's not the *people* being discussed with.
*   **D: pradeshawaseen (residents)** - The passage focuses on interactions with medical professionals, not general residents.



"
daen madhyama welanda sankeernaya lesa bhaavitha karanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **D: kaelejon del beso**.

Here's why:

The question asks what the *sandahan* (building/structure) is that is described as being in the middle of a complex arrangement. The text specifically states: ""Kaellegon dell beso (sipa gaeneeme maavata)."" This translates to ""Kaellegon del Beso (a building with six rooms).""  The text then continues describing its physical characteristics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: jardin di laa yuniyan:** This refers to the garden/union, not a building.
* **B: da aele of da kis:** This phrase doesn't appear in the text.
* **C: templo di saen diyego:** This refers to the temple of Saint Diego, which is mentioned as a destination *reached* from the building, not the building itself.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a vibrant, artistic space.** It mentions music (""sangeetha""), a hall (""madhyama mandapaya""), and performances (""kriyaatmaka wana"").  The detailed description points to a place designed for artistic expression.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: paerani aadara andarayaka niwaahana (residence with a shaded courtyard)** - While the passage mentions a courtyard, it's not the central focus. The primary aspect is the artistic performance space.
    * **C: ud‍yaanayata muhunalaa aethi awanhal (a barrier with beautiful flowers in the garden)** - This is a detail *within* the larger space, not the space itself.
    * **D: paerani konwant godanaegillak (not possible to build a covered courtyard)** - This is not mentioned in the passage.

The passage emphasizes a grand central space for artistic gatherings and musical performances, making **A** the most accurate answer.

However, someone who is moderately healthy finds joy in this.)

This directly translates to option C, highlighting that the actions described (the day's events) bring joy to someone in moderate health.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage mentions a happy journey, it doesn't say providing comfort *is* essential for the enjoyment of the day. It's a component, but not the core of finding joy.
* **B:** This focuses on the covering of the day, which is a minor detail and doesn't address the central theme of *who* finds pleasure in these events.
* **D:** The passage explicitly states providing comfort *is* important, even for children. This option contradicts that.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, dinaka kandu naegeema sandaha itha awama soodaanamak awashya wanne kawadada?","The correct answer is **B: eya pahasu adi parakata sambandha wu vita** (it's related to the strong impact of the day).

* **The passage states:** ""Pahasu adipaarak osse dinaka payn gamana sandahaa awashya wanne kudaa soodaanamak wana athara, madyastha washayen soukya sampanna onaema kenekuta eya rasa vindiya haekiya.""  This translates to ""Even a small amount of hardship on a day with a strong impact is enough to make someone with moderate well-being feel its taste.""  This clearly links the need for comfort to the *strength* of the day's impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kandu naginnaa sawukya sampannawa sitina vita** (being comfortable despite the itching) - The passage isn't about coping with the itch itself, but the *effect* of the day's events.
* **C: lamayin kandu naegeemata yana vita** (going to scratch the itch) - This is a literal action, not the underlying reason for needing comfort.
* **D: kandu naegeema wadaath swabhavika parisarayaka siduwana vita** (being caused by a natural environment with the itching) - The passage implies the itch is a metaphor for hardship, not a literal physical issue caused by the environment.



"
norwe hi anekuth pradesha ha sasandana vita rogaland ho aegdel saanuwa hi aethi wenasa kumakda?,"Let's break down the question and the provided text to find the correct answer.

**Understanding the Text (P):**

The text is descriptive and metaphorical. Here's a rough translation (keeping in mind nuances are hard without full linguistic expertise):

* It speaks of a landscape (""Baevum kandu kalapu saha ihala..."") with hills and valleys, suggesting a level state of being.
* It mentions a ""seed"" (""sanuva"") that grows into something vast and boundless (""aseemitha pulul""). This growth is associated with the concept of ""knowledge"" (""viddae"").
* It then talks about ""Rogaland"" and ""Aegdaarhi"" being commonly associated with a ""hei"" (which seems to be a term related to a particular kind of vastness/emptiness - a branchless cow, metaphorically, suggests limitless space).

**Understanding the Question (Q):**

""In Norway, how far do seeds from Rogaland or Aegdel typically spread in various regions and conditions?""

**Analyzing the Options:**

* **A: ehi gas aetha (Here gas comes)** - This doesn't relate to seed dispersal or distances.
* **B: kandu athara patu kalapu nae (There are no hills or valleys)** - This describes the landscape, not seed spread.
* **C: saanuwa boho durata pulul we (The seed grows far and wide)** -  This aligns with the text's description of the seed growing into something ""aseemitha"" (boundless).  It hints at wide dispersal.
* **D: ewa boho vita hedar walin aawaranaya wee aetha (It is covered by dust from many places)** - This suggests being obscured, not spread.

**Conclusion:**

Option **C** best answers the question based on the provided text. The text emphasizes the expansive growth of the seed, implying a significant spread.  While it doesn't give *specific* distances, it conveys the idea of broad distribution.



Therefore, the answer is **C**."
"mema chedayata anuwa, norwehi saaman‍ya lakshanayak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **D: moorlands**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a landscape.** It talks about rolling hills (""samathalaa bhava""), open spaces (""vivurta gas rahitha avakaashayak""), and a landscape often associated with barren or sparsely vegetated areas.  It specifically mentions ""Rogaaland"" and ""aegdaarhi"" which are regions in Norway known for moorlands. The description of ""shaakha rahitha gohoru bima"" (cow pasture without branches) further points to open, somewhat bleak landscapes typical of moorlands.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: viwurtha bhoomi pradesha (developed land/area):** The passage explicitly mentions *lack* of development and open space.
    * **B: wanaanthara saanuwa (forest landscape):**  While there might be *some* trees, the emphasis is on open, rolling land, not a dense forest.
    * **C: baewum sahitha kandu athara patu kalapu (mist with rocky and swampy areas):** While mist and some rocky/swampy areas are *possible*, the dominant feature described is the open, rolling landscape, aligning better with moorland.

* **The question (Q) asks about common Norwegian landscapes.** Moorlands are a very common and defining feature of the Norwegian landscape, especially in areas like Rogaaland and Aegdaarhi mentioned in the passage.



Therefore, based on the descriptive details and geographical references in the passage, **moorlands** is the most accurate answer."

* **P's text describes a place that is typically visited during travel time (sanchaaraka samayae) and is beautifully covered in snow (hima matha lissaa yaama).**  This clearly points to a cold season destination.
* **The question asks *when* travelers visit this place.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: uparima sanchaarakayin aethi samaye dee** (during the peak travel time) - While it's visited during travel, the description focuses on *why* it's visited – the snow.  ""Peak travel time"" doesn't explain the snow.
* **C: indiyaanu sarath irthuwe dee** (during the Indian summer) -  The text explicitly mentions snow, making summer impossible.
* **D: wasanthaye dee** (during spring) -  Spring is unlikely to have significant snowfall.

Therefore, the text strongly suggests the location is popular *during the cold season* because of its snowy landscape.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, kandukara sthaanawala saaman‍yayen waedima sanchaarakayin pramaanayak sitinne kawadada?","The correct answer is **A: adhika himapathanaya atharathura** (more snowfall occurs).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** explains that India's skiing destinations are best visited during times with *heavy snowfall* because this creates beautiful and spectacular scenery.  The passage specifically connects good conditions to plentiful snow.
* **Q (the question)** asks what is typically true of ski resorts.
* **A** directly addresses the key element from P – the presence of significant snowfall.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: hima puwaruwe lissa yana samaya puraawatama** (the time when snow melts is shorter) – While snow *duration* is relevant, the passage focuses on the *amount* of snow.
* **C: indiyaanu sarath irthuwe dee** (India is located in the শরৎ season) – Irrelevant to the conditions of ski resorts.
* **D: sheetha irthuwe masa puraawatama** (the winter months are shorter) –  Again, duration isn’t the focus; the *amount* of snow is.



Therefore, the passage directly supports the idea that more snowfall is a defining characteristic of good ski resort locations."
oba udaw sandaha bottuwak soya gaeneemata balaaporoththu wanne nam oba kumak kirimen waelakee sitiya yuthuda?,"The correct answer is **A: thatakaye ihalata ha pahalata aevideema** (to look at both sides of the issue).

Here's why:

* **The original text (P)** emphasizes the importance of understanding different perspectives (""ovunge thorathuru oba samaga beda ganu aetha"" - to understand their different viewpoints). It encourages considering various angles and appreciating the enthusiasm of different people (sailors, travelers, those connected to palaces).  It speaks to a holistic understanding of situations.
* **The question (Q)** asks what you would do if you encounter conflicting information.
* **Option A** directly addresses this by advocating for considering all sides before forming an opinion.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: kapithanwarun samaga mithra weema** (to be friends with captains) - While building relationships is good, it doesn't address the core issue of resolving conflicting information.
* **C: obe sewaawan prachaaraya kirima** (to promote your own service) - This is self-serving and irrelevant to the question.
* **D: bottuwe gaman karana sesu aya nosalaka haereema** (to simply proceed based on the direction you're already heading) - This ignores the need to evaluate conflicting information and could lead to errors.



Therefore, **A** best reflects the wisdom conveyed in the original text."
udaw awashya wana bottuwak soyamin gaman karana vita kudaa waraaya pilibandawa wataha gatha yuththe kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: yaathrawa pirisidu karana vita pamanak owun wetha langaa weema** (meaning: those who are completing their journey).

Here's why:

The passage (P) repeatedly mentions people *completing* journeys:

* ""...thama yoch yaathraa pirisidu karana minisun wetha yamin..."" (people completing their own desired journey)
*  The overall context is about helping those arriving (completing a journey) and providing assistance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: naeviyan samaga sambandhatha paewaethweema** (those connected with navy/ships) - While the passage mentions a dockyard, it's not the *core* focus of who needs help.
* **B: waedi awadhaanayak wethin waelakee siteema** (those arriving with special attention) - The passage doesn't focus on people receiving special attention, it's a general offering of help.
* **D: bottuwe gaman karana sesu ayagen waelakee siteema** (those arriving based on a scheduled journey) - The passage doesn't specify scheduled arrivals, it's open to anyone arriving.

Therefore, option C best reflects the people the passage is addressing – those who are finishing their travels and arriving at a destination.



"
diwayine yatath vijitha ithihasaya gaena unanduwak dakwana aaganthukayan aakarshanaya karanne kumana sthaanayada?,"The correct answer is **A: uthuru werala** (Northern Territories).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hon kong dupathe naagarika sanvardhanayen vishaala pramaanayak, uthuru verale goda kala idam mata idi wee aetha. Meya brithaanya yatatvijitakaruvan thamangema lesa allaa gath sthaanaya wana athara...""  This translates to: ""Hong Kong Island has seen vast development by its citizens, and this is also a place that was originally not taken by the British colonialists..."" This directly links the Northern Territories to a history *not* colonized by the British, making it relevant to understanding Hong Kong's pre-colonial past.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: kowuloon jala muhunatha** (Kowloon waterfront) - The passage mentions Kowloon, but as a contrasting area to Hong Kong Island, not as a site of pre-colonial history.
*   **C: hon kong nagara madyasthaanaya** (Hong Kong city center) - The passage doesn't specifically discuss the city center's historical significance.
*   **D: viktoriya waraaya** (Victoria Harbour) - While iconic, Victoria Harbour is described as a visual feature of the modern city, not a place holding evidence of the pre-colonial past.



"
vishmaya janaka darshana walata pramukhathawaya dena sanchaarakayekuta wadaa aakarshaneeya wanne kumana sthaanayada?,"The correct answer is **A: viktoriya waraaya (Victoria Harbour)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hon kong ahas ima sakasana godanaegili pela, viktoriyaa varaaye jala thalaya magin drushyamaana wana didulana sthambha prasthaarayakata samaana kara aetha.""  This translates to ""Hong Kong has many skyscrapers, especially the stunning skyline visible from Victoria Harbour.""  

The question asks for the most attractive place for a tourist seeking spectacular views. Victoria Harbour is directly presented as having this stunning visual appeal.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: hon kong propar (Hong Kong property):** This refers to land/real estate, not a tourist attraction.
* **C: hon kong doopatha (Hong Kong Island):** While a part of Hong Kong, the passage doesn't highlight it as *specifically* visually stunning. It's a larger geographical area.
* **D: kowuloon jala muhunatha (Kowloon waterfront):**  The passage mentions Kowloon, but it's contrasted with Hong Kong Island, and doesn't portray it as the primary visual draw.



"
ashwarohakayage paadaya pa patiyata hira weememe avadaanama awama kirimata upakaree wana saedalaye kotasa kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: aarakshitha theeru (ආරක්ෂිත තීරූ)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...padavannage kakul eva thula siravimen aarakshaava pilibada gaetalu aethi kala haekiya."" This translates to ""There were complaints about the security of the pavement even with a thick covering.""  It also mentions ""...upakaaree wana aarakshaka tiru aetha"" - ""a protective strip was useful.""

* **The question asks:** Which part of the horse rider's foot helped the pavement in this situation?

The pavement needed *protection* due to the horses. Therefore, the ""aarakshitha theeru"" (protective strip) is the part that was helpful.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: patu yati pathul (පත්ර යාති පතුල):**  This refers to leaves falling – irrelevant to the problem.
* **C: sam paa pati (සම්පාතී):** This doesn't have a clear meaning in the context and isn't mentioned in the passage as being helpful.
* **D: waedi sthaawarathwayak (වැඩි ස්තාවරත්වයක්):**  This means increased stability, but the passage focuses on *protecting* the pavement, not making it more stable.



"
paa pati bhaavitha karana vita asaruwage aarakshaawa waedi kirimata upakaree wana boot sapaththu wala kumana angayada?,"The correct answer is **A: ralu, patu pathula** (రలు, పటు పథుల - meaning ""stones, flat paths"").

Here's why:

The passage discusses the importance of protecting the *padavanna* (footpath). It states that along the footpath, things like stones and flat paths (*ralu, patu pathula*) are useful for safety.  The passage specifically mentions these elements being used to secure the edges of the footpath.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ham** (හම - meaning ""sand"") - Sand isn't mentioned as a protective element.
* **C: vilumba** (විලුම්බ - meaning ""delay"") -  This is a concept, not a physical element used for protection.
* **D: pulul pathula** (పులుల్ పథుల - meaning ""grass paths"") - While grass *could* be around a path, the passage emphasizes more solid materials for safety.



Therefore, based on the passage, **stones and flat paths (ralu, patu pathula)** are the elements used for safety along the footpath."
aaganthuka sathkara huwamaru jala haraha sanchaarakayinta laba denne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: laabha guvan gaman**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pariganaka kramalekhakayeku wana keysi fentan ayislanthayata laabhadaayi guvan gamanak soyagaat...""  This directly translates to ""A profitable journey was available to anyone who wanted to be a computer typist..."" This journey/advantage/benefit (laabha guvan gaman) was available due to the infrastructure built.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: desheeya sathkarakayan samaga nawathaen (connections with national honors):** The text doesn't mention national honors or recognition.
* **C: desheeya margopadeshakayin visin laba dena sanchaara (travel that gives access to national guides):** The text focuses on access to jobs and learning opportunities, not travel with guides.
* **D: ekama gamanaanthayata paeminena anekuth sanchaarakayin samaga sambandhatha (connecting with many travelers on a single journey):**  The text isn't about travel or connecting with other travelers. It's about access to opportunities.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Samahara jaalayan athireka sathyaapanaya labaa deemata ho awashya vuvada...""  This directly translates to ""It is necessary to confirm excess baggage for many networks...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage mentions travelers getting information about national hospitality, but it doesn’t say *how* they get it.
* **C:**  The passage speaks about a printed and/or online list of local hospitality, but doesn’t say travelers *receive* it. It mentions it was gathered through surveys and consultations.
* **D:**  The passage states travelers *gave* opinions on national hospitality meetings, not received them.

"mema chedayata anuwa, hawul nevaasikagara kaamarayaka awama washayen daekagatha haekke kumana aakaraye aaganthukayinda?","The correct answer is **A: wayasa mul visi gananwala wu aaganthukayan** (the visitor who calculates age-based statistics).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""Navaathaen gannekuge saamanya vayasa visi ganan we"" - meaning ""They calculate average age statistics for newcomers."" This directly points to someone who deals with age calculations.
* **The question (Q) asks:** ""...kumana aakaraye aaganthukayinda?"" - ""...what kind of visitor?"" 
* **Option A** directly reflects the function described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: thaniwa gaman karana aaganthukayek** (a visitor who travels alone) - The passage doesn't mention anything about solo travel.
* **C: kudaa daruwan samaga sanchaaraya karana aaganthukayek** (a visitor who interacts with children) - While the passage mentions children, it doesn’t say the visitor *interacts* with them.
* **D: wayasa mul this gananwala wu aaganthukayek** (a visitor who calculates age *this*) - This is a grammatically awkward and doesn't quite capture the meaning of ""statistics"" as presented in the passage.



"
"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, nevaasikagarayaka raendee siteemata boho durata ida aeththe kawuda?","The question asks what the text suggests is a significant distance for a caregiver. The text (P) discusses caregivers helping young people, and mentions the difficulty of finding caregivers for children, but also that some caregivers *do* offer individualized attention. It hints at a challenge in finding consistent help, especially as people age.

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: alutha upan bilindeku samaga gaman karana yuwalak (a young person going with newly formed friendships)** - This doesn't relate to distance or the difficulty of finding caregivers.
* **B: ekata gaman karana 22 haeviridi thidenek (22 friends going together)** - This is unrelated to the caregiver context.
* **C: 70 gananwala yuwalak (a 70-year-old person)** - This is the most plausible answer.  The text implies challenges with finding caregivers as people age and need more assistance. A 70-year-old needing care is a situation where finding a suitable caregiver would likely be significantly difficult.
* **D: daruwan samaga gaman karana pawul dekak (ten children going with a caregiver)** - While the text mentions difficulty finding *childcare*, it doesn't suggest a *distance* issue associated with it.

Therefore, the best answer is **C**.  The text subtly implies that age (and thus needing care) creates a distance – a difficulty in finding appropriate support.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the boomarang's popularity with travelers (""sanchaarakayin"") and its widespread use (""janapriya kusalatavaki"").**  The passage talks about how boomarangs became known through travelers and were used by locals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: niwaeradiwa visi kalahoth eya saemavitama obe athatama paeminenu aetha** (If you don't know how to throw a boomerang, it will always come back to your hand) - The passage *mentions* it coming back, but doesn't focus on the *how* of it being reliable.
* **C: ost‍reliyawe boho boomarang nomaetha** (Boomerangs originated in Australia) - The passage states they came *from* Australia (""Owustreliyave daknata haeki boomarangawalin"") but doesn’t state that’s where they originated; it speaks to their spread in popularity.
* **D: aapasu aa haekke samahara boomarangwalata pamani** (There are measurements for many boomerangs) - The passage doesn't discuss the physical characteristics or measurements of boomerangs.



"
jaavaanu aahara piseemedee pradhaana washayen bhaavitha karanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: pol seeni**.

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions ""visesayen jaawaani pol seeni"" (especially Javanese coconut sugar) as a key ingredient in Javanese cuisine.  It highlights its importance alongside spices, salt, and sugar.  The other options (white sugar, black sugar, palm sugar) are not specifically emphasized as *primary* to Javanese cuisine in the given text.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, bowana roga paethirenne keseda?","The correct answer is **A: aasaditha pudgalayin** (contaminated particles).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bovena rogayak yanu asadita pudhgalayeku laga siteemen pahasuven walandiya haeki rogayaki.""  This translates to: ""A disease can spread from contaminated particles/matter.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: rogakaraka (disease-causing agents):** While this is *related* to how diseases spread, the passage specifically mentions the *source* of the spread – the contaminated particles *containing* the disease-causing agents.
* **C: baekteeriya (bacteria):** Bacteria are *types* of disease-causing agents, not the initial spreading medium described in the text.
* **D: ennath (rules/regulations):** These are about *controlling* disease spread, not how it *happens*.



Therefore, **aasaditha pudgalayin** is the most accurate answer based on the given text."
"mema chedayata anuwa, bowana rogayak rogayak aethiweemata hethuwak nowana lesa handunaagena aeththe meyin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: vairas** (viruses).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vairasayak, bacteriavak, dilirayak how wenath parapositayan wani roga karakayakin hataganna rogayak bovana rogayak yanuven haedinve.""  This translates to: ""Diseases like viral, bacterial and parasitic infections cause illnesses to spread.""

The question asks what *causes* a spreading disease.  The passage directly links viruses (""vairasayak"") to causing diseases to spread.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ennath** (parasites) - While parasites *can* cause diseases, the passage doesn't specifically state they are the primary cause of *spreading* diseases in this context.
* **C: baekteeriya** (bacteria) -  Bacteria cause diseases, but again, the passage doesn't isolate them as the main cause of diseases *spreading*.
* **D: dileera** (parasites) - Same as A, parasites are mentioned as disease-causing agents but not specifically linked to the *spread* of disease in the passage.

Here's why:

* **The original text (P) explicitly states:** ""...http pamanak nova, siyaluma antharjaala dattha gaman eva pratiyomu karayi.""  This translates to ""...using http protocol, it completely reverses all internet data traffic."" This is the *primary* function of a web proxy in this context – to intercept and route internet traffic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: parisheelakayata siyalu gaman daththa prathiyomu kirimata awashya vita** – ""All traffic must be reversed for inspection."" This is too broad. The text focuses on *internet* data traffic, not *all* traffic.
* **B: waaranaya saha oththu baeleema haekithak walakwa gaeneemata parisheelakaya saelakilimath wana vita** –  ""Inspection is limited to protection against warnings and spam."" While proxies *can* help with security, the text highlights data reversal as the primary purpose, not just filtering spam/warnings.
* **D: parisheelakayage kriyaakaarakam sandaha madhyastha sita ihala mattame kalaapa palalak awashya wana vita** – ""The operation of the inspection requires a large number of servers as intermediaries."" This mentions server capacity, which is a *consequence* of the proxy's function, not its core function itself.



Therefore, **C** directly reflects the main point of the passage regarding the web proxy's operation."

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) clearly states:** ""Deshapaalanika vaarana saha vaanija ip-bhu perahan magahaerimata pudgalika vpn (athathya pudgalika jaala) sapayanno visista maargayak labaa dethi. Eva hetu kihipayak nisa web proxy valata vada hondaya: http pamanak nova, siyaluma antharjaala dattha gaman eva pratiyomu karayi.""  This translates to: ""Using a VPN (virtual private network) offers a specific way to avoid government surveillance and commercial IP tracking. The reason is that web proxies simply don't encrypt all internet data.""

* **Option D directly reflects this information:** It states that VPNs *do* encrypt internet traffic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While VPNs often offer better privacy than web proxies, the passage focuses on *encryption* as the key difference.  ""Wadaa waedi kalaapa palalak laba deyi"" (offers better privacy) is too broad and doesn't pinpoint the specific benefit highlighted.
* **B:**  The passage *contrasts* web proxies with VPNs, saying proxies *don't* encrypt all traffic.
* **C:** The passage doesn't discuss the quality of VPN services. It focuses on the encryption feature.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage."
yamekuta owunge jiwath wana pradeshayen pitatha durakathana samaagamak bhaavitha kirimata ida denne kumak da?,"The correct answer is **D: PSTN durakathana**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Bohovita, oba wetha **ptsn durakathanavalin** aematima sandaha ida dene wenama jaatyantara ankayak mila dee gatha yutuya.""  This translates to ""Often, if you receive calls on **PSTN landlines**, you may have received a call from an unknown number.""

The question asks *what* causes the feeling of being contacted by someone from another country. The passage directly links that feeling to calls received on PSTN lines.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: antharjaala prathiyomu aemathum (Internet responses):** While the passage mentions the internet, it doesn't link the feeling of being contacted from abroad to internet responses.
*   **B: goleeya durakathana anka (mobile phone numbers):** The passage doesn’t mention mobile numbers being the cause.
*   **C: chand‍rika (Chandrika):** Chandrika is mentioned as someone *who* received an internet connection, but isn't the cause of the feeling described in the question.

"mema chedayata anuwa, yam aemathum laba gaeneema sandaha kumak kala yuthuda?","The correct answer is **C: obe pradesheeya prajawen ankayak laba gaeneema**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""Oba jivath wana prajaaven desiya ankayak labaa gaeneeme awashyathavayak da nomaeta;"" This translates to: ""You don't necessarily need to obtain a national identity card from the people in the area where you live.""

Therefore, the question (Q) ""yam aemathum laba gaeneema sandaha kumak kala yuthuda?"" (""According to this, what kind of identity can be obtained?"") is answered by the possibility of getting an identity card from your *regional/local people* (pradesheeya prajawen).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: goleeya ankayak miladee gaeneema** - The passage doesn't mention a ""goleeya"" (group) identity.
*   **B: desheeya durakathana samaagamak bhaavitha kirima** - This relates to a national disaster relief effort, not an identity card.
*   **D: PSTN durakathanayak miladee ganna** - This refers to getting information over a PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) which isn't about identity.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""Boho wachana eva liyana aakaarayenma uchcharanaya kireema hetuven itaali bhashaven uchcharanaya sapeksava pahasuya. Evaye uchcharanaya ilanga svaraaksharayata anuva venas wana baevin...""  This translates to ""Because of the difficulty in pronouncing Boho words even with vowels, Italian pronunciation is comparatively easier. Its pronunciation doesn't follow the rules of vowels...""  This directly supports the idea that Boho pronunciation *doesn't* follow vowel rules.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: dvithwa aar akurehi uchchaaranaya thani aar akurata wadaa wenas we** - The passage doesn't discuss diphthongs or individual vowels in comparison.
* **B: boho wachana ewa liyana aakarayenma uchchaaranaya karanu labai** - While true that the passage mentions difficulty with vowels, this isn't the central point of the comparison to Italian.
* **C: see saha ji yana akuru sahitha wachana aseeru viya haekiya** - The passage doesn’t mention 'see' and 'ji' sounds or ease of pronunciation.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate and directly supported answer based on the information provided in the passage."
noothana yugayata pera ismir hi aarambha wee aeththe pahatha sandahan lakshana walin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: saappu madyasthaana (shopping center/trade center)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Izmir evolved into a ""honda pravaahana madyasthaanayak"" (a major transportation hub) and a ""sanvardhitha ha kaaryabahula vaanija madyasthaanayak"" (a developed and busy trade center).  It highlights its growth as a commercial hub in the modern era.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: pulul manmawath (flourishing people):** While Izmir is a populated city, the passage focuses on *how* it flourished, not just that it has people.
* **B: weeduru muhunath sahitha godanaegili (buildings with pointed roofs):** The passage mentions architecture, but pointed roofs aren’t the defining feature of its modern development. It talks about a mix of styles.
* **D: rathu-tayil wahala (stone paved roads):** The passage mentions old roads and churches, but stone paved roads aren’t central to its modern character.



"

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Puraana smirnaa nagaraya woo eya daen navina, sanvardhitha ha kaaryabahula vaanija madyasthaanayak wana athara eya **vishaala bokkak vataa pihita aethi menma kandu valin vatavi aetha.**"" (The ancient Smyrna city, from which it originated, became a new, improved and functional commercial center, and **it is said to be surrounded by a vast landscape**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: parisaraya sampradaayika thurkiya pilibimbu karayi** (the surrounding area shows traditional Turkish images) - While the passage *mentions* traditional Turkish characteristics, it doesn't highlight this as a primary characteristic.
* **C: obata naweena sappu madyasthaana saha paerani palli yana dekama soyagatha haekiya** (it is a place where you can find new shopping centers and old churches) - This is *a detail* mentioned, but not the overarching characteristic described in the beginning.
* **D: ehi thurkiye dewana vishaalathama waraaya aetha** (it is a vast city in Turkey) - This is true, but the passage focuses on its *surroundings* being vast, not just the city itself.



"
hanaami kiyana wachanayen adahas karanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: cheri mal pipeema naerabima** (cherry blossom viewing).

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states: ""Hanami lesa haedinvena cheri mal pipima naerabima..."" which translates to ""Hanami is known as viewing cherry blossoms...""  The rest of the passage elaborates on the cultural and social significance of this practice in Japan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: japan wanshadhipatheen** (Japanese dynasty) - While the passage *mentions* dynasties in the context of Hanami's history, it doesn't *define* Hanami as the dynasty itself.
* **C: plam mal pipeema naerabima** (plum blossom viewing) - The passage specifically refers to *cherry* blossoms (""cheri mal""), not plum blossoms.
* **D: adhiraajya adhikaranaya** (imperial authority) - Imperial authority is a theme *within* the historical context of Hanami, but not what Hanami *is*.



"
cheri mal pipeema naerabima sandahama wu palamu sadayata sathkarakathwaya daekwuye kawuda?,"The correct answer is **C: japana adhiraajyaya (Japanese Empire)**.

Here's why:

This translates to: ""In Japan, the imperial court initiated the cherry blossom festival, and it spread through the influence of imperial officials and societal trends.""
* **The question (Q) asks:** ""To which empire does the cherry blossom festival's initial spread relate?""
* Therefore, the passage clearly links the *beginning* of the cherry blossom festival's spread to the **Japanese Empire**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: cheena adhiraajyaya (Chinese Empire):** The passage doesn't mention China as the origin or early spreader of the festival.
* **B: japana wanshadhipatheen (Japanese dynasty):** While related to the Empire, the passage specifically emphasizes the *empire's* role in initiating and spreading the festival, not just the dynasty.
* **D: cheena wanshadhipatheen (Chinese dynasty):** Similar to option A, China isn't mentioned in the context of the festival's origins.

"mema chedayata anuwa, sanchaaraka vyaaparaya aakarshanaya kara gaeneemata awama washayen ida aeththe jerusalame pahatha sandahan angayangen kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: nagaraye aagamika waedagathkama** (the city's religious significance).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Nagaraye aagamika vaedagathkama hetuven, saha visesayenma paerani nagaraye pradeshaye boho sthaana hetuven, jerusalam ishraayalaye pradhaana sanchaaraka gamanaanthavalin ekaki.""  This translates to: ""Because of the city's religious importance, and especially because of the holy sites within the city, Jerusalem is a primary destination for travelers in Israel.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: eesh‍raayalaye aganuwara lesa wana ehi thathwaya** (the fact that it became Israel's capital) - While mentioned, the passage focuses on *why* people visit, not the political status.
* **C: ehi sanskruthika dae** (its cultural aspects) - Culture is mentioned, but as a *result* of the religious significance, not the primary driver for tourism.
* **D: boho ayithihaasika sthaana** (its many historical sites) -  History is also mentioned, but again, it's linked to the religious significance and doesn't stand alone as the main attraction.



"
jerusalama prasiddha weemata hethuwak lesa mema chedaye sandahan nokaranne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: aagamika waedagathkama (religious significance)**.

Here's why:

* **The text heavily emphasizes Jerusalem's importance to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.** It states it's a sacred city for all three religions, a spiritual, religious, and cultural center.  This is the primary reason for its prominence.
* While the text mentions history (aakarshaneeya ithihasaya) and cultural standing (sanskruthika sthaana), these are *results* of the religious significance, not the core reason for its fame.
* Deshapalana balapaem (political power) isn't the main focus of the text, although it does mention Jerusalem being Israel's proclaimed capital.



Therefore, **aagamika waedagathkama** best encapsulates why Jerusalem is famous according to the provided text."
mema chedayata anuwa wayildkaad pathak miladee gaeneemen prayojana noganu aeththe kumana wargaye sanchaarakayin da?,"The correct answer is **B: Krugar jaathika wanod‍yaanaya pamanak sanchaaraya karana sanchaarakayek** (A tourist who travels specifically to the Kruger National Park).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dakunu aprikaave thoraagat udyaana ho dakunu aprikaave siyaluma jaathika udyaaana wetha pivisima sandaha wayildkard pathak miladi gaeneema da yamekuta waasidaayaka vanu aetha."" This translates to: ""It also accommodates a large number of wildlife cardholders who enter either as tourists to South African parks or to national parks in South Africa.""
* **The question asks:** Who *doesn't* need a wildlife card to enter?
* The passage implies those visiting *specifically* Kruger National Park benefit from the wildlife card system, meaning a tourist whose primary destination is Kruger likely *would* use a card.  The question is looking for the tourist who *wouldn't* need one.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: haeki tharam saenpark sanchaaraya kirimata saelasum karana sanchaarakayek** - A tourist who travels to several Sanparks (South African National Parks). They *would* need a card.
* **C: ud‍yaana gaasthu gaena saelakilimath wana adu ayawaeya sanchaarakayek** - A tourist who only enters the park as a day visitor.  They might still benefit from a card, and the passage doesn't exclude them.
* **D: krugar jaathika wanod‍yaanaya saha awama washayen thawath ek ud‍yaanayak naerabimata saelasum karana sanchaarakayek** - A tourist who travels to Kruger and another park incidentally.  They might use a card.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""eyata uthurin simbabwe rata wana athara, dakunu mayima wanne kimbul gangayi. mema udyaanaya magin vividhaakara wana sathunta navaathaen sapayana varga kilometera 19,500ka bim pramaanayak aawaranaya karana athara vividha parisara kalaapa 14kata bedee aetha."" (It is bordered to the north by Zimbabwe and to the south by the Limpopo River. This park covers an area of approximately 19,500 square kilometers and consists of 14 diverse ecological zones.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eya dakunu aprikaave pradhaana aakarshanayak lesa saelake** (It is popular as a main attraction of South Africa) - While true, this doesn't explain the *size* or *extent* of the park. It speaks to its popularity.
* **C: eya dakunu aprikaave kudaama jaathika wanod‍yaanayayi** (It is the largest national park in South Africa) - The passage doesn't explicitly state it's the *largest*, only that it's a prime attraction.
* **D: wayild kaad pathak miladee gaeneema haraha sanchaarakayanta eyata piviseemata haekiya** (Wild card paths are available for tourists to enter) - This discusses access, not the park's area.



"
kandehi thiyunu kotas haraha kandu naginnanta anathurak weemata boho durata ida aeththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: gal padipela** (stone steps).

Here's why:

The passage describes Machu Picchu being built on a mountainside with ""මාර්ගයේ දිගෙ බොහො තැන wala gal padipela"" (stone steps along the path). The question asks about what's found on the slopes of the mountain, and the passage explicitly mentions stone steps.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: theth thathwayan** (the flat surface) - While Machu Picchu has flat areas, the passage doesn't specifically mention these as being *on the slopes*.
*   **C: kudaa guhaa** (cave) - The passage mentions caves (""මුදුනට ආසන්නයේ itha kudaa guhaavak aetha""), but they are near the summit, not specifically on the slopes.
*   **D: wane kambi aadhaaraka** (leaning post support) - These are described as being *under* the stone steps, supporting them, not *being* on the slopes themselves.



"
mema chedaye visthara kara aethi machu pikchu kandehi naegeema niwaeradiwa pilibimbu nokaranne pahatha sandahan prakaashayangen kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: yahapath shareera suwathawakin yuktha kandu naginnanta pawa husma gaeneeme apahasutha aethi weemata haekiya** (meaning: the area where bodies are buried is said to be a place where breathing is difficult due to the presence of spirits).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Machu Picchu as a place with a history of burials (""nashtaavasesa jaayaarupavalata pasubim wee atha"").**  It also mentions difficulty breathing (""husma gaenimata apahasuvim balaporottu wanna"") and a feeling of being watched or haunted (""anaturudaayaka viya haeki baevin adhika baevum sahitha sthaanavala dee"").  This strongly links the difficulty breathing to the presence of spirits related to the burials.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: kandu baewum wala pawaa ath waetawal kisiwak nomaetha** (meaning: there is nothing special about the stones around the cliffs) - The passage focuses on *more* than just the stones; it emphasizes the feeling of the place and its historical context.
* **C: oba kanda mudune guhaawak tharanaya kala yuthuya** (meaning: it is said that the way down the mountain is through a cave) - The passage mentions a cave (""mudunata aasannaye itha kudaa guhaavak aetha"") but doesn't focus on it as the primary characteristic related to the strange happenings.
* **D: theth wu vita kandu baewum kotasa anathurudayaka we** (meaning: the stones around the cliffs are not easily broken) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the stones being hard to break.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate representation of the passage's details regarding the strange feeling and difficulty breathing at Machu Picchu, connected to its burial history."
"mema chedayata anuwa, mayokanu aahara piseeme dee pradhaana aaharayak nowanne mewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: maansha (meat)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the Mayokanu food is characterized by ""elavalu saha **mansha** (visheshayen ooru mas) matha wana athara"" - meaning it includes grains and **meat** (especially pork).  It further describes preparations *with* meat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: paan (bread)** - Bread is *used with* the food, but isn't the defining ingredient.
* **C: dhaan‍ya (grains)** - While grains are mentioned, meat is highlighted as a key component, especially pork.
* **D: elawalu (vegetables)** - Vegetables are present but not the main defining feature.

"mema chedaye aethi thorathuru matha padanamwa, haengi aahara pilibanda sathya nowana prakaashaya kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: bhoo ushnathwa haengi sandaha wala unusum kirimata ginnakin unusum kala gal bhaavitha karayi** (The text suggests that changes in food habits are driven by concerns about global warming).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on how climate change (bhoo ushnathwa) is influencing food choices (aahara).** It mentions shifts in what people eat due to concerns about sustainability and local sourcing.  The phrase ""ginnakin unusum karagath gall valin rath karanu laebe"" directly translates to a focus on sustainable food choices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: unusum gal bhaavitha karana haengi welintan hi laba gatha haeka** (Wellington has benefits in influencing food habits) - While Wellington is mentioned, it's just one example location; the passage doesn't claim it *influences* food habits generally.
* **C: rost vilaasithawe raathree bhojana sangraha boho vita haengi bhaavithayen pisinu laebe** (Traditional roast dinners are being replaced by other night meals due to influence) - The passage mentions traditional roasts, but doesn't say they are being *replaced*. It implies a wider range of food choices are being considered.
* **D: bhoo ushnathwa haengi rotoruwa hi soyagatha haekiya** (The rotorua region is affected by global warming) - Rotorua is just *another* example location, and the passage doesn't focus on its specific impact.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate and comprehensive reflection of the passage's main point."
haenji wala unusum kirime saaman‍ya kramayak lesa sandahan kara naeththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The question asks what the passage generally discusses, less about specific details and more about the overall topic. Let's break down the passage:

* **Focus on food preparation & consumption:** It talks about preparing food (""aahara vaelak pisinu""), enjoying meals (""boho vita bhaavitha karay""), and different times for meals (""raathri aahaaraya"").
* **Emphasis on location and its impact:** It discusses how location (Wellington, Venath, etc.) and climate (""bhoo ushnathwa"") influence food.
* **Traditional cooking methods:** Mentions ""sampradhaayika roast"".
* **Natural resources and impact:** Discusses the earth's properties impacting food sources.

Considering this, **A: gaes (gas)** seems like the *least* relevant option. The passage doesn't center around gas specifically.  **B: unusum karagath gal (places to eat)** is partially relevant, but too narrow. **C: bhoo ushnathwa thaapaya (establishing earth's temperature)** is also a specific element, not the core topic. **D: unusum karagath gal (places to eat)** is repeated.

The most fitting answer is **B or D: unusum karagath gal (places to eat)**, as the passage broadly relates to where and how food is enjoyed, even if it expands into environmental factors. Since D is a repetition, **B** is the preferred answer.

Therefore, the answer is **B**.



"
bhikshuwa ho bhikshuniyage piligaeneemata hethu viya haekke kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: deepthimath warnayakin yuthu aawaranayak paelandeema**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*pivisume sitina bhikshuva ho bhikshuniya obata sinaa movin piliganu aetha. E aakarayenma, pirimee danahis aawarana karana kalisam aendima awashya waethi.*"" This translates to ""...if a monk or nun asks you for something, you should definitely be willing to give it when they ask for it, especially a beautifully colored robe.""  

The passage directly links the request (piliganu aetha - asking for something) to the need to provide, and specifically mentions a robe (""deepthimath warnaya"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: obe urahis aawaranaya kirima (covering your body):** While the passage talks about covering, it's about covering *others* (giving them robes), not yourself.
* **C: aaraamayen aawaranayak illaa gaeneema (not having a covering from the monastery):**  The passage doesn’t state that monks/nuns lack coverings. It emphasizes the *giving* of coverings.
* **D: danahisata ihalin kapana lada saayak aendeema (asking for something that’s hard to get from donors):**  The passage doesn't specify the difficulty of obtaining the request; it simply states a willingness to give when asked.



"
aaraamayakin illaa gaeneemata ida nomaethi wanne pahatha sandahan aendum walin kawareda? ,"The correct answer is **C: kalisam**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses the importance of covering oneself (aawarana) properly, especially when entering or being in a monastery (aaraama).  It repeatedly emphasizes the *kalisam* (a set/group/collection) used for covering.  The question asks what one needs when there isn't a monastery available – the implication is, you still need *something* to cover with, and that is the *kalisam*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: saayawal** - While a *saayawal* (shawl) *could* be used for covering, the passage specifically emphasizes the *kalisam* as the essential item.
*   **B: kota kalisam** -  This doesn't make sense in the context.
*   **D: aawarana** - *Aawarana* means ""covering"" itself. The question isn't asking *what* covering is needed, but *what item* to use when a monastery isn't present.



Therefore, **kalisam** is the most direct and accurate answer based on the text."
aentaaktik kalaapaye sanchaaraya karana vita tharu baeleemata waedima awasthaawak laebenne kawadada?,"The correct answer is **B: pradeshaya etharam janaakeerna nowana vita** (areas that are not well-populated).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""Pradesha ithaa aduven janaakirna baevin saha aaloka dushanaya da bohovita gaetaluvak novena athara, obata tharu naerambimata da haeki wei.""  This translates to ""Because this area is sparsely populated and there isn't much light pollution, it's a good place to see the Northern Lights.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: gimhana maasawaladee (winter months):** While the Northern Lights are *more common* in winter, the passage doesn't say winter is *required* for good viewing.
* **C: seetha irthu maasawaladee (cold months):** Similar to A, cold temperatures are common but not the defining factor.
* **D: aaloka dooshanaya awama wana vita (places with light pollution):** The passage specifically says the *lack* of light pollution is beneficial.



Therefore, the key condition for seeing the Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) in the Antarctic region, as described in the passage, is being in an area that isn't densely populated."

Here's why:

The passage states: ""saamanyayen chandrika durakatanayak yanu jangama durakatanayak sandaha adesanayak nove."" (generally, Chandrika the guide is not a mobile guide who can give directions).  It then explains this is *because* her view is obstructed (""chandrikavak samaga paehaedili drushya rekhavaka sitiya yuthu baevin"").  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pihiteema itha durastha we nam** (if it's far away behind) - The passage doesn't discuss distance being the reason she can't give mobile directions.
* **C: eya elimahane bhaavitha karanne nam** (if it doesn't excite her) - Her lack of excitement isn't the reason for her inability to guide dynamically.
* **D: gaweshanayakata nishchitha daththa awashya we nam** (if definite data isn't required for the search) - This is irrelevant to why Chandrika is not a mobile guide.



"
chand‍rikaa durakathanayak jangama durakathanayakata wadaa sudusu wanne kawadada?,"The correct answer is **C: durastha daththa awashya nowana vita** (not needing distant data).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...saamanyayen chandrika durakatanayak yanu jangama durakatanayak sandaha adesanayak nove."" This translates to ""...generally Chandrika the storyteller is not a mobile storyteller needing instructions.""  This implies Chandrika doesn't *require* distant data or travel (i.e., she's not a ""jangama durakathanayak"" in the traditional sense).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: nagarayaka niwaaduwak gatha karana atharathura** (depending on living in the city) - The passage doesn't mention anything about where she lives.
* **B: bottu sanchaarayak atharathura** (depending on postal communication) - This is also not mentioned in the text.
* **D: obata pramaanawath jangama durakathana aawaranayak laebeemata haeki vita** (if you can get a confirmed mobile storyteller) - This is irrelevant to *why* Chandrika is not considered a traditional mobile storyteller.

Here's why:

The passage states that Transnistria was formed in 1994 ""due to this demographic composition, with Moldovans and Russians, and with economic and administrative foundations."" This directly links the formation of Transnistria to the *people* who live there - the demographic makeup.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: aarthikaya (economic):** While economics are *mentioned* as a foundation, the primary driver identified is the population composition.
*   **C: bhaashawa (language):**  The passage discusses language (Romanian/Russian), but doesn't state it's the reason for Transnistria's formation.
*   **D: aagama (religion):** Religion is mentioned as a characteristic of Moldova, not a reason for the split leading to Transnistria.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Deshapaalana saakachcha asaarthaka woo namuth moldovave mema kotas deka athara aarthika sabaedi naewatha sthaapitha kara aetha.""  This translates to ""Although politically ineffective, Moldova established economic ties with these areas.""

The question asks *why* Transnistria declared independence. The passage implies it was due to Moldova establishing economic control/ties over the region, which led to Transnistria wanting self-determination.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: bhaashawa (language):** While language is mentioned (Russian vs. Romanian), it's presented as a characteristic *of* the region, not a cause for separation.
*   **B: aagama (religion):** Religion is mentioned as a common faith, but doesn't explain the secession.
*   **C: eksath jatheenge piligaeneema (national identity):** The passage states Transnistria isn't recognized by any nation, suggesting a lack of established national identity at the time of declaration.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Montevidiyo pihita aeththe upa nivartana kalaapaye ya, gimhaana maasavaladi selsiyas ansaka 30 ta waedi ushnathwa saamaanya deyaki."" This translates to ""In the subtropical zone where Montevideo is located, the summer months usually have temperatures between 30 degrees Celsius.""
* **The question asks:** When would a traveler experience warm weather in Montevideo?
* **Therefore:** Summer in Montevideo (gimhaanaya thula) is the time of warm weather.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: uthuru ardhagolaye sheetha irthuwe masawaladee (Northern Hemisphere winter months):** The passage explicitly describes the *opposite* effect in Montevideo – it's summer when the Northern Hemisphere has winter.
* **C: uthuru ardhagolaye gimhana masawaladee (Northern Hemisphere summer months):**  Again, this is the opposite of what happens in Montevideo.
* **D: montevidiyo hi sheetha irthuwe masa waladee (Montevideo's winter months):** The passage describes the winter as cold, not ideal for a warm weather traveler.

This translates to: ""Because Montevideo is located in the southern hemisphere, when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer there due to the reversed seasons.""

The question asks what can be deduced about the season in Montevideo. The passage directly tells us that when it's winter in the northern hemisphere, it's *summer* in Montevideo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: uthuru ardha golayehi gimhaanaya wana vita** (It's summer in the northern hemisphere) - The passage states the *opposite* is true - it's winter in the northern hemisphere.
* **C: montevidiyo hi waesi samaya wana vita** (Montevideo is in the rainy season) - While the passage mentions rain (""varshaya""), it doesn't definitively state that it *is* the rainy season.
* **D: uthuru ardha golayehi sheetha irthuwa wana vita** (It's winter in the northern hemisphere) - This is true, but doesn't specifically tell us about the season in Montevideo, which is what the question asks.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""me kaalaye prasiddha graefiti kalaakaruvan, graefiti kriyaakaarakam saha e sandaha wana """"nityaanukula"""" biththi aetha.""  This translates to ""This time, the famous graffiti artists, graffiti activists and the suspect 'Nityanukula' are connected.""
* **The question (Q) asks:** who is suspected of associating with established graffiti artists and potentially engaging in destructive behavior?

Therefore, ""graffiti art activist"" (graefiti kalaa kriyaakaarakam) is the most logical answer directly supported by the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: kurutu gaem:**  This refers to a place (kurutugaem) mentioned in the initial crime description, not a person.
* **C: podu depala matha anawashya bithu sithuwam:**  This phrase is descriptive of the situation (""public property or unnecessary bit of thought"") and doesn't represent a person involved.
* **D: kiyaviya nohaeki dae:** This means ""a case that cannot be explained"" which isn't a person.

* **The passage states:** ""Yovun daruvan sahitha pavul sandaha samahara uthsavavala vishesha kandavuru pradesha pawathee.""  This translates to: ""Especially the Kandavuru region, with families and youth, holds many festivals.""  This indicates the festivals are a characteristic of that region.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kudaa daruwan raegena ema (being with children):** While youth are mentioned, it's not the defining characteristic of *how* the festivals participate.
* **C: raathriya pasuwana thuruma sangeethaya wadanaya kirima (playing music at night):**  Music is *part* of the festival, but doesn’t define the service/participation aspect.
* **D: welaasanin paemineema (being invited):**  The passage mentions being invited, but it's about attendance, not a fundamental service.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...sandaha obata velaasanin paeminimata siduvanu aetha."" This directly translates to ""so that you can get a good place to sit at the festival.""  The question asks what is necessary to get a good place near the stage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: raathriye pramaada wee paemineema** (to enter at night for fun) - While the festival might be fun, the passage focuses on getting a *place* to see the music.
* **B: pawul sandaha wu pradeshayaka raendee siteema** (to come from the province where families gather) -  The passage mentions families but doesn't link this to getting a good viewing spot.
* **C: sthaanayen baehaerawa kandawuru baendeema** (to find the place by searching) - While you might need to search, the passage suggests arriving early is key.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions casinos (""kaesino"") multiple times in relation to nighttime activities (""raathri kriyaakaarakam"") and gambling (""saelakiya yuthu""). It describes avoiding casinos in Albuquerque and Santa Fe, and hints at casinos being a significant draw in the region.  The question asks about nighttime activities for visitors in northern New Mexico, and the text strongly points to casinos as a prominent option.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: pubalos:** While pubs might exist, they aren't specifically highlighted in the text.
* **B: kudaa nagara wala aethi baar:** The text mentions bars in Las Vegas but not specifically in Santa Fe or Albuquerque.
* **C: saappu sankeerna:**  Shopping complexes aren't mentioned as a focus for nighttime visitors.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions casinos in both Albuquerque and Santa Fe.** It contrasts them, stating enjoyment can be had at casinos (specifically mentioning Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
* **The question asks about a famous entertainment spot in the north (Uthuru) and Mexico (Meksikowe).**  Santa Fe is a well-known city in the northern part of New Mexico, and casinos are a major entertainment draw there.
* **The passage dismisses the idea of gambling heavily in Albuquerque** as being ""far away"" and not ideal for a quick evening.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aelbakarki sita paeya dekaka durin pihiti kaesinowaka** (Albuquerque sits far away during the difficult period of casinos) -  The passage *mentions* Albuquerque, but says it's too far for a quick trip.
* **B: durastha publo pradeshayaka** (remote Pueblo region) - While New Mexico has Pueblos, they aren't specifically mentioned as entertainment hubs in the passage.
* **D: kudaa nagara wala aethi baar ekaka** (an ethical bar in Kudaa Nagara) - Kudaa Nagara is mentioned as a less desirable location, and a bar isn't the focus of the passage.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the text."

This translates to: ""Although French wine varieties are gaining popularity, **New Zealand and Australian wine varieties are being marketed more widely**.""

The question asks about what a traveling salesperson would likely sell. Given the text, Australian wine is a strong candidate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: bothal kala jalaya (bottled water):** While mentioned, it's presented as a negative example (something you *wouldn't* want to sell if you have access to good tap water).
* **C: desheeya beera (local beer):**  The text discusses local beer, but doesn't suggest it's a major item for a traveling salesperson.
* **D: palathuru beema (insurance):** The text mentions insurance briefly and dismissively (""although valuable, it's expensive"").

"mema chedaye visthara kara aethi pradeshaya matha padanamwa, wetar vyaakoola weemata ida aeththe pahatha sandahan beema aenawum walin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: keti kalu kopi** (black coffee).

Here's why:

The passage describes different types of coffee and brewing methods. It specifically details how ""keti kalu kopi"" (black coffee) is made - using an 'espresso' base with crema (foam) and then milk is added. The question asks for something detailed *within* the passage. The other options are either vague references (""nambar wan ekak"" - a certain hero class) or mentioned briefly without detail (the Australian ""thani sudu"" coffee concept, and the mention of Sauvignon Blanc).

Therefore, the passage provides the most detailed description of **keti kalu kopi**.



"
shathawarsha thunak puraawatama paewathi yatath vijithakaranaye kala parichchedaya aarambha karana ladde kumana kandaayama visinda?,"The correct answer is **D: Spaniyads** (Spanish).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Spaangna aakramanikayan ha svadesika kandaayam ekata muna gaeseeme pratiphalayak lesa ya."" which translates to ""This resulted from the clash between the Spanish invasions and the native uprisings.""  and further clarifies that the period of Spanish conquest began sometime in the past.  

Therefore, the Spanish initiated the period of conquest being referenced.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: payaaguwa** - The text mentions Payaguwa as a group living in the area, but doesn't say they *started* the period of conquest.
*   **B: guwayikuru** - Similar to Payaguwa, Guwayikuru were inhabitants but not the initiators of conquest.
*   **C: guwarni** - This isn't directly mentioned in the context of initiating the conquest period.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, paerisiyanuwan oba wetha lan kara gaeneemata hondama kramaya kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: paerisiyanuwange aakalpaya anukaranaya kirimata uthsaha kirima (to strive to imitate the Parisian's imagination)**.

Here's why:

* **The Passage's Core Message:** The passage describes Parisians as self-interested, proud, and renowned for their elegance. It encourages the reader to adopt the *essence* of Parisian refinement – their sophisticated imagination and style – but warns against simply *appearing* Parisian. It emphasizes being ""well-educated"" and internalizing their standards, not just mimicking the outward appearance (""bien eleve"").  The final line suggests that true Parisian qualities manifest naturally from a cultivated character.

* **Analyzing the Options:**
    * **A (Imitating the Parisian's imagination):** This directly aligns with the passage's emphasis on adopting the *inner* qualities – the creativity, style, and sophistication – rather than superficial imitation. It’s about understanding and embodying the Parisian *ethos*.
    * **B (Having faith):**  Faith isn't a central theme in the passage.
    * **C (Being cultured):** While culture is implied, the passage is more specific about the Parisian *type* of culture (elegance, imagination).  It's not just about being generally cultured.
    * **D (Wanting to appear refined):**  The passage explicitly *warns against* this. It says not to simply *seem* ""bien eleve"" (well-bred) but to *be* that way through genuine understanding and cultivation.

**Therefore, option A best captures the ""hondama kramaya"" (true way) the passage advocates for – a deep, internal assimilation of Parisian refinement through the cultivation of imagination and style.**



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, paerisiyanuwange ekakruthi gunangayak lesa salakanu nolabanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawarakda?","The correct answer is **A: ahankaraya (arrogance/ego)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""Paerisiyaanuvan svaarthaavaadi, ralu saha **ahankaara** pirisak lesa prasiddhaya."" (Paerisiyaanu was famous for selfishness, anger, and **arrogance**.)
* **The question (Q) asks:**  What single quality of Paerisiyaanu is NOT mentioned in the passage as a flaw?
* **The other options *are* mentioned as flaws:**
    * **B: ralu bawa (anger):** Directly stated in the passage.
    * **C: sellakkarakama (greed/selfishness):**  ""svaarthaavaadi"" means selfish.
    * **D: hadisi bawa (fear):** While the passage talks about an outward appearance of weakness (""hadisi baahira svarupayan""), it doesn't state fear itself as a defining flaw.

Therefore, arrogance/ego (ahankaraya) is the quality that's explicitly mentioned as a flaw, making it the correct answer.



"
kep tawun hi met‍ro dumriya hi palamu panthiye wasiyak wanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: maediri dumriye idiripasata wannata aetha** (it is like a train running on a track).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""keip tavunvalata aasannathama dumriyehi metroplas dumriya maediri aeththe saemavitama pitupasini."" This translates to: ""For passengers, metroplas trains are very similar to trains running on tracks.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: etharam janaakeerna nowe (it is not generally known)** - The passage actually *describes* metroplas, it doesn't say it's unknown.
* **C: eya thewana panthiye prawesha pathrayakata milen adu we (it is similar to an entrance to a second path)** - The passage focuses on the *operation* of metroplas, not its purpose as an entrance.
* **D: eya met‍ro praveshapathaka milata samana we (it is similar to a metro entrance)** -  Again, the passage describes it as a *train* (dumriya) not an entrance.

Therefore, option A directly reflects the comparison made in the passage.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, kep tawun hi saema magee dumriyakama aeththe kumakda?","The correct answer is **D: palamu panthiye saha thewana panthiye maediri** (like the first and second paths).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Metroplas (palamu panthiya lesada haedinve) saha metrow (thewana panthiya lesa haedinve).""  This translates to ""Metroplas (like the first path) and Metrow (like the second path).""  Later, it says the train will be *like* Metroplas and Metrow.  Therefore, it will resemble both the first and second paths.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: adu janaakeerna met‍ro maediri** (like a crowded metro) - While the passage mentions Metroplas being crowded, it doesn't say the train *will be* crowded.
* **B: panthi dekatama ekama prawesha pathra mila** (getting a single entry ticket) - This isn't discussed in the passage.
* **C: wenas panthi thunak** (some other path) - The passage specifically links the train to the first and second paths, not some other one.



"
sathwa palibodhakayak hata kala nohaeki wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: aasadanayak paethiraweema** (spreading disease).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly states:** ""...Aaasadanaya wana roga..."" which translates to ""...Disease spreads from dissatisfaction...""  This links dissatisfaction (a form of *sathwa palibodhakaya* - mental torment) to the spread of illness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: palukushta aethi kirima** (doing foolish things) - While mental torment *can* lead to foolish actions, the passage focuses on the physical consequence of disease.
* **B: asathmika kaesilla** (untruthful illness) - The passage doesn't mention anything about illnesses being untrue.
* **D: barapathala thuwala sidu kirima** (causing the body to break down) - While a consequence of disease, the passage emphasizes the *spread* of disease originating from mental torment.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage."
peragewum durakathana kadapath miladee gatha haekke kothaeninda?,"The correct answer is **A: visheshitha ratawala (specialized areas)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""...*samahara eva visheshitha ratawal kaanda wetha laabhadaayi milakata aematum gaeneeme haekiyaawa labaa de.*"" This translates to ""...especially in specialized areas, it is beneficial to enter this service to obtain profitable opportunities.""

The question (Q) asks where profitable opportunities related to difficulties/challenges are found.  The passage directly links these opportunities to ""visheshitha ratawala"" (specialized areas).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: dumriya sthaanawala (foggy places):**  The passage doesn't mention anything about foggy places.
* **C: konar sappu wala (corner shops):** The passage doesn't mention anything about corner shops.
* **D: mudal gewaa aemathum gannaa sthaanawala (places to start and earn money):** While the service *leads* to earning money, the passage doesn't say the *location* of the opportunities are these starting points. It emphasizes the *type* of area - specialized ones.



"
samahara kadapath magin laba dena wadaa honda aemathum gaasthu wetha prawesha wanne keseda?,"The correct answer is **B: gaasthu rahitha anka haraha** (meaning ""no gas cost"").

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""...boho durakathanavalin aematiya haeki gaasthu rahitha durakathana ankayak harahaa we.""  This translates to ""There are no gas costs for many accidents.""  It's emphasizing a benefit of this service – avoiding gas expenses associated with accidents.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ewata prawesha viya haekke visheshitha ratawala pamani** (entering based on special rates) - While the passage mentions special rates, it doesn't directly answer the question of *how* to get a good deal.
* **C: konar saappu haraha** (no corner shops) - This is irrelevant to the passage.
* **D: mudal aya karana durakathanavalin bhaavitha kirimen saha amathara gaasthuwak geweemen** (affecting the cost of accidents involving initial investment and other gases) - This is a confusing restatement of potential costs, not a benefit or way to get a good deal.



Therefore, option **B** is the most direct and accurate answer based on the provided text."
"mema chedayata anuwa, plitwees lek jaathika wanod‍yanaye bahulawa daknata nolaebena gas wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **D: sprus gasa**.

Here's why:

The text (P) states: ""...Plitvayis leik jaathika vanodyaanaya pradhaana washayen beech, **sprus saha devadara** gas valin adhikava gahana wana athara..."" ( ""...the Plitvice Lakes National Park is primarily characterized by dense forests of beech, **spruce and fir**..."")

The question (Q) asks which tree is *abundantly* found in the park.  While beech and fir are mentioned, **spruce (sprus)** is specifically highlighted alongside beech as a primary characteristic of the forest.

Therefore, the answer is **D: sprus gasa** (spruce gas).



"
plitvis leks jaathika wanod‍yanaye daknata haekiwana durlabha saththwa visheshaya mewayin monawada?,"The correct answer is **D: kaeparsayili**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) specifically mentions ""kaepakaeilee aadi durlabha sathun da mehi daekagata haeka"" – meaning rare animals *including* the kaeparsayili are found in Plitvice Lakes National Park. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: thurkiya** - Turkey is a country, not an animal found in the park.
*   **B: mee maessan** - This doesn't appear to be a recognized animal name.
*   **C: kaesawari** - Cassowaries are found in Australia and New Guinea, not Europe.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, kalaapeeya ketha aeththa washayenma udaw karanne kumak sandaha da?","The correct answer is **D: neethi virodhee pitapath kirima** (engaging in unlawful/immoral fathership).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) specifically mentions:** ""kalaapiya ketha niti virodhi pitapath kireema kerehi kisidu balapaemak aethi nokarayi"" which translates to ""they did not show any strength by engaging in unlawful/immoral fathership."" This directly relates to the question asking what the passage discusses in relation to the *kalaapeeya ketha* (false accusation).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: thaeti pitapath kirima** (doing fathership bit-by-bit) - While mentioned, it's a description of *how* they did it, not the central issue discussed in connection to the false accusation.
* **B: weladapola palanaya** (rule of governance) -  This is mentioned as a *result* of the actions, but not the actions themselves.
* **C: muhudu kollakaem waelaekweema** (sea-related killings) - This is the initial phrase, but the passage quickly moves beyond simply mentioning it and focuses on the *response* and the accusations related to immoral behavior.



Therefore, the passage primarily discusses the false accusations stemming from engaging in unlawful fathership."
"mema chedayata anuwa, maadhya samaagam visin nirmaanaya karana lada kalaapeeya kethaya pilibanda wu boruwak wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: waedi welandapala palanayak laba gaeneema sandaha ewa awashya we** (This information is essential for those who want to gain a good understanding of the central congregation).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""...maadhya samaagam puruddak lesa mehi aramuna pilibandava boru pawasathi."" (to clarify matters relating to this congregation).  It continues to say understanding this will help those who want to be strong leaders within the congregation (""Sabaema aramuna wanne, ema samaagamvalata thama weladapalawala vadaat honda paalanayak labaa deema wana athara..."").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: neethi virodhee pitapath kirima walakwa gaeneemata ewa upakaree we** (It is useful for avoiding unethical practices) - The passage mentions unethical practices *in relation to* the information, but doesn't state the information *itself* is useful for avoiding them. It’s about understanding the congregation, not primarily avoiding wrongdoing.
* **C: ewa mudal bhramanaya sandaha prayojanawath we** (It is useful for starting a journey) - The passage doesn’t talk about journeys or beginnings.
* **D: prakaashana sorakam waelaekweemata ewa kalaathurakin upakaree we** (It is helpful for artistic expression in publication) - The passage is about a religious congregation and leadership, not art or publication.



Therefore, option A directly reflects the stated purpose of the information provided in the passage."
oba obe maw ratata paeminena vita saaman‍yayen avidhimath wanne kumana kriyaawaliyada?,"The correct answer is **D: regu paalanaya (regulation enforcement)**.

Here's why:

* **P's statement** talks about things that *happen* when immigration checks aren't done properly, specifically mentioning regulation enforcement becoming necessary.  It's a consequence of not following the proper process.
* **Q asks** about actions typically taken when someone enters a country improperly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aagamana vigamana pareekshaawa (immigration checks):**  This is the *thing being avoided* in the original statement, not the action taken when it *doesn't* happen.
* **B: bhaanda pilibanda prakaashaya (disclosure of goods):** While important for customs, it's not directly related to illegal entry.
* **C: bhaandawala neethyaanukoola seemawan (goods with statutory limits):** Again, related to customs and not directly to irregular immigration.



Therefore, **regu paalanaya (regulation enforcement)** is the action most logically connected to the situation described in the initial passage."
obe maw ratata paemineemata pera oba daenagatha yuththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The question (Q) asks: ""What kind of support did you receive when you came to my country?""

The passage (P) discusses a general situation of immigration examinations, regulations, and the potential for historical actions. It doesn't directly address *support* received by an individual upon arrival in a country.  It speaks about potential difficulties and the need for transparency.

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: aagamana vigamana pareekshaawak thibeda yana bawa (being stopped at immigration/emigration examinations)** - This relates to *difficulties* with the process, not support.
* **B: neethyaanukoola seemawan ikmawana bhaanda prakaasha kirimata awashyada yana bawa (the need to reveal things within legal limits)** - This is about transparency requirements, again not support.
* **C: regu paalanayak thibeda yana bawa (being stopped by regulations)** -  Similar to A, this is about obstacles, not support.
* **D: oba gena ena kisiyam bhaandayak sandaha awasara nomaethida yana bawa (not having the opportunity to share anything you know)** - This suggests a lack of a platform to speak, not receiving assistance.

None of the options accurately reflect *support* received. However, considering the context of the passage discussing potential difficulties, **option D is the *least wrong*.**  The passage hints at a system that might not be receptive to an immigrant's perspective, which could translate to not having a chance to express oneself or receive assistance.

**Therefore, the best answer, although imperfect, is D.**



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, kochamo nimnaye kandu naginnan nirantharayen nawa maarga soyaa gaeneemata ida salaswanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: kandu mudun**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kandu mudhunwala vishmayajanaka dasun aetulat wa thibe."" (Amazing forests were found descending from the mountain.)
* **The question asks:** What is continuously created as Kochamo descends the mountain, according to the passage?
* The passage directly links descending from the mountain (""kandu naginnan"") with the creation of forests (""kandu mudun"").  ""Dasun"" (forests) are *within* the ""kandu mudun"" (descending of the mountain/mountain slopes), not the process itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: dasun (forests):** Forests are *found* descending, they aren't the act of descending itself.
* **B: muduna (descending):** While related, ""muduna"" is too general. The passage specifies descending *from the mountain* and creating something.
* **D: biththi (wall):**  The wall is mentioned as part of the landscape, not something created by the descent.



"
"mema chedaye dakwa aethi thorathuru matha padanamwa, dakunu ardhagolaye waedima haras maaru aawaranaya karanne kawuda?","The correct answer is **A: skayiteem**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""kisima guvan sevaa sandhaanayak dakunu ardha golaye saagara haras maaru tunama aawarana nokarayi (thavada SkyTeam kisidu haras maaru kisiyam aawaranaya nokarayi ).""  This translates to: ""No flight service covers the southern hemisphere's sea routes (except SkyTeam does not cover any routes).""

Therefore, SkyTeam is the only option mentioned that *does* cover routes in the southern hemisphere. The other options (Star Alliance, South Pacific, and Latam/World) are either destinations or don't offer complete coverage.



"
dakunu ardhagolaye saagara haras maaru awama washayen aawaranaya karanne kumana guvan sewa sandhaanayada?,"The correct answer is **A: star elaayans**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**staar elayans sandhaanaya, latam van warld sandhaanayata ayat, naegenahira dakunu pacific santiayago di chili sita tahiti dakva haerennata, an siyalla aawaranaya karayi.**""  This translates to ""Star Alliance serves, along with Latam and World, to destinations including Santiago de Chile and Tahiti in the southern Pacific, and covers them all.""

The passage also states that no SkyTeam or Southern American carriers cover the southern hemisphere sea routes.  Therefore, Star Alliance is the only option listed that *does* cover those routes.



"
global raning tuwars sarthaka kara gath sanchaaraka sanvidhaanaya kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: raning kopanhegan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Basilonaave basilona raning tuwars saha kopanheganhi raning kopanheganvala mula sahitava eya ikmaninma raning tuwars praag haa wenath eva haa sambandha viya.""  This translates to something like ""Basilon's Basilona running tools, and *running kopanhegan* with the root of running kopanhegan, this is connected to running tools prag and venath.""

The question asks what makes global running tools meaningful. The text directly links ""running kopanhegan"" as a crucial component, even mentioning it with the root and connection to other tools. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: go raning tuwars:** While mentioned, it's described as something *being* obtained *from* the tools, not something that makes them meaningful.
* **C: raning tuwars prag:**  Mentioned as connected, but not presented as the core element of meaning.
* **D: raning tuwars basilonaa:** Similar to 'prag', it’s connected but not the key factor.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, go raning tuwars sthaana duwamin narambana chaarika sanvidhaana karana aayathana keeyak sandaha upakaree weda?","The correct answer is **A: hatharak**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""...mahadvipa hataraka sitina sthaana duvamin narambana saepayumkaruvan raashiyak ekata jaalagata karayi.""  This directly translates to ""a network of operators positioned in the second nerve of the main island hataraka.""
* **The question (Q) asks:** ""...go raning tuwars sthaana duwamin narambana chaarika sanvidhaana karana aayathana keeyak sandaha upakaree weda?"" This asks about what helps establish operations in the second nerve of the go raning tuwars.
* **Therefore, ""hatarak"" (operators/people positioned) is the answer** as it is explicitly mentioned in the passage as being present in that location and involved in establishing something (implied operations).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 200:** This refers to the approximate length of the initial description, not the operational location.
* **C: dusim gananak (digital computing):**  Not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: thunak (funds):** Not mentioned in the passage.



"
sanchaarakayeku cheetage paehaedili dasunak apekshaa karanne nam kumak kala yuthuda?,"The correct answer is **C: duradaknayak bhaavitha kirima** (cultivating a feeling of elusiveness/remoteness).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sinhayan, cheetaavan saha diviyan aetaem vita lajjaashili wana athara obata ovun duradaknavalin vadaat hondin daekagata haeki we.""  This translates to ""Lions, leopards and elephants are shy animals, and you will get a better view of them if you make them feel elusive/remote.""

The question asks what a tourist should do to see a cheetah. The passage *directly* answers this by saying making them feel elusive is the key to getting a good view.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kandu naegeeme safariyak yaama** (going on a safari in the dry zone) - While the safari is *in* the dry zone, this isn't the specific action to see a cheetah.
* **B: panduru athara aevideemata yaama** (going to see the wild animals) - Too general.  It doesn't address *how* to see a cheetah.
* **D: motar rathayak gena sammatha upakarana bhaavitha kirima** (using appropriate equipment with a motor vehicle) - The passage mentions motor vehicles, but this isn't the key to *seeing* the cheetah, it's about *how* you get around.



"
"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, waahanayaka safari vinoda chaarikawaka yedena aaganthukayeku hamuweemata ida aeththe kumana wargaye sathekda?","The correct answer is **A: sinhayan** (lions).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sinhayan, cheetaavan saha diviyan aetaem vita lajjaashili wana athara obata ovun duradaknavalin vadaat hondin daekagata haeki we.""  This translates to: ""Lions, cheetahs and elephants are shy animals, and you can see them better if you approach them slowly and carefully.""  The question asks which animal a visitor is *most likely* to see on a safari.  Lions are specifically mentioned as being visible with patience, making them the most likely answer.

The other options are mentioned, but not with the same emphasis on being viewable:

*   **Jiraaf (Giraffe):** Mentioned as being seen from vehicles, but not highlighted as being easily observed.
*   **Diviyan (Elephants):** Mentioned alongside lions and cheetahs as shy, but not singled out as particularly viewable.
*   **Cheetaavan (Cheetahs):** Also mentioned as shy.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, sanchaaraye viyadama adu karanu aeththe kumakda?","The passage (P) talks about wanting to go on a journey with 4 to 6 people, enthusiastically. It contrasts this with the reality of often having to travel alone or with just one friend, and how people often believe others are wasting their money on travel.

The question (Q) asks what the *purpose* of the journey is, according to the text.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: oba visinma gaman kirima (you go on a relaxing journey)** - While a journey *could* be relaxing, the text focuses on *who* you go with, not the nature of the journey itself.
*   **B: hathara denekugen yuth kandaayamak soya gaeneema (to experience a journey with many people)** - This directly reflects the desire expressed in the passage – going with 4-6 people.
*   **C: thawath ek pudgalayeku samaga gaman kirima (to go with just one person)** - The text explicitly states this is often *not* the case, and is a contrast to the desired situation.
*   **D: haya denekugen ho eeta waedi yuth kandaayamak soya gaeneema (to experience a journey spending a lot of money)** - The passage mentions others thinking travel is a waste of money, but it doesn't say the purpose of *their* journey is to spend a lot of money.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: hathara denekugen yuth kandaayamak soya gaeneema**. It aligns perfectly with the central theme of wanting to travel with a group.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, hondama sanchaaraka mila anupathaya laba gatha haekke katada?","The correct answer is **A: motar ratha maru kirimata kaemathi sanchaarakayin** (drivers who change vehicles, like switching cars).

Here's why:

The passage describes people frequently changing vehicles during a journey (""manda boho vita motor rathha piravima sandaha sanchaarakayinva ehaa meha maaru karati"").  The question asks for the best description of those who benefit from frequent travel companions. The passage suggests those who switch vehicles often *need* companions because of the logistical challenges of constantly changing transport.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: thun denekugen yuth kandaayamak:** (a group of two or three people) - The passage mentions groups of 4-6, not just 2-3.
*   **C: ekata gaman karana mithuran dedenek:** (seeking friends to travel with) - While companionship is mentioned, the primary focus is on the *need* for companions due to the travel situation.
*   **D: pas denekugen yuth kandaayamak:** (a group of five or six people) - While the passage mentions groups of 4-6, this is a description of the group *size*, not the *type* of traveler being discussed.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sangitaya, chitrapata, saahithyaya saha Janapriya sanskruthiya thula ehi nirantara nirupanaya, nagaraya saha e thula aethi visheshatha lowa pura prasiddhatvayata pathweemata upakaaree wee aetha.""  This translates to ""The continuous representation of music, cinema, literature and popular culture here contributes to the fame of the city and its special character."" This directly links San Francisco's popularity to its thriving arts and media scene.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: palamu panthiye sammanthrana pahasukam** (luxury tourism of the first rank) - While mentioned as benefiting from tourism, it's a *result* of the attraction, not the core reason.
* **C: aarthika vividhaangeekaranaya** (economic diversification) - This is also a result of the attraction, not the primary driver.
* **D: naegee ena aasiyanu aahara pradarshanayak** (a display of diverse Asian cuisines) -  The passage mentions Asian influences but doesn't emphasize cuisine as the primary attraction.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, saen fraensisko pilibandawa sathya nowanne pahatha sandahan prakaashawalin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: boho hotal saha sammelana madyasthaana aetha** (it is a large number of hotels and convention centers).

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Hotel, aapanasaala, ihala pele sammantrana pahasukam raashiyak samaga saen fraensiskova vishaala sanchaaraka yatitala pahasukamak sanvardhanaya kara aetha."" This translates to ""Hotels, restaurants, and large convention centers significantly contribute to the expansion of San Francisco's vast tourism industry.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eya boho vita chithrapata ha poth wala daknata laebe** (it is shown in many movies and books) - While the passage *mentions* representation in film, literature, and popular culture, it doesn’t present this as a primary truth about San Francisco.
* **B: aasiyanu aahara janapriyayi** (Asian food is popular) - The passage briefly mentions influence from Asian cuisines (Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese) but doesn't state Asian food *is* popular.  It's a contributing factor, not a defining truth.
* **D: aarthikaya mulumaninma sanchaaraka vyaaparaya matha randaa pawathee** (economic fundamentals and tourism business are twofold) - The passage mentions economic diversification and the importance of tourism, but doesn't characterize it as a ""twofold"" fundamental.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate and direct reflection of what the passage highlights about San Francisco."
"mema chedayata anuwa, sanchaaraka niyojithayekuge sewaawan bhaavitha kirimen prayojana noganne kumana wargaye sanchaarakayekuda?","The correct answer is **C: thawamath thama visaa labagena naethi sanchaarakayek** (a traveler who doesn't have the flexibility to change their plans).

Here's why:

The passage states that a travel planner is most useful for travelers who *need* flexibility - those who might need to change dates, locations, or make adjustments.  It specifically mentions that if you have rigid plans and don't need adjustments, a travel planner isn't necessary.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: avinishchitha sanchaarakayeku** (an uncertain traveler) -  While a planner *can* help with uncertainty, the passage focuses on the *need* for flexibility, not just being undecided.
* **B: swayansiddhathawayata goduru wu sanchaarakayeku** (a traveler who is comfortable being independent) - Independent travelers are less likely to *need* a planner.
* **D: paekeja ganudenu wen karawa gaeneemata kaemathi sanchaarakayek** (a traveler who wants to arrange packages) - Planners *offer* packages, but the core benefit described is dealing with changes and providing flexibility.



"
sanchaaraka niyojithayeku haraha wen karawa gaeneeme prathilaabhayak lesa chedaye sandahan kara nomaeththe pahatha sandahan karunu walin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: siyalla aethulath paekeja** (all inclusive packages).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that travel planners (sanchaaraka niyojitayin) often offer combined packages including transportation, lodging, and hotel packages (""saamanyayen ude aahaaraya, guvantotupale sita/wethata gamaanagamana pahasukam piliyela karavima ho sanyukta guvan yaana saha hotel paekeja pavaa aetulat paekeja labaa dei""). The question asks what benefit a travel planner offers when arranging travel.  All-inclusive packages are a key benefit they provide.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: kadinam sanchaaraka lekhanaya** (travel writing) - This is related to travel *about* travel, not a direct benefit *from* a planner.
*   **B: hotal deemanaa** (hotel management) - While travel planners work *with* hotels, hotel management isn't the benefit they offer to the traveler.
*   **D: wen karawa gaeneemak randawa gaeneema** (finding discounts) - While finding discounts *can* be a part of a planner's job, it's not the primary, encompassing benefit described in the text. The text emphasizes the convenience and completeness of packages.

"mema chedayata anuwa, thathya kaleena pata pariwarthaka yedumakata kala nohaekke monawada?","The correct answer is **B: sampurna paata kotas pariwarthanaya kirima** (translating complete text quotes).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**sampurna paata kotas ek bhaashavakin tawa ekakata svayankreeyawa parivaarthaanaya kala haeki yedum**"" - which translates to ""This tool is capable of automatically translating complete text quotes in one language to another.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: videsha bhaasha sanngaa pariwarthanaya** (translation with foreign languages) - While it *uses* foreign languages, this isn't the *function* of the tool described. It's a given.
* **C: smaart jangama durakathanaya haraha wasthun pilibanda pata pariwarthanaya kirima** (translating text about smart mobile devices) - The passage doesn't mention any specific subject matter of the translation.
* **D: 100% k ma niwaeradiwa pariwarthanaya kirima** (100% accurate translation) - The passage *acknowledges* that translations aren't always perfect and can sometimes be inaccurate (""notherena parivaarthaana siduvanne kalaaturakini"").



"
pariwarthana nobaendiwa sidu kirimata ida denne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: bhaasha daththa baagatha kirima** (providing the language data).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...apeksita bhaasha daththa baagata kireemen pasu nobaedi parivaarthaanayata ida dei.""  This translates to ""It gives this for translation, *not* providing the desired language data.""  This directly points to a lack of language data being the reason for failure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: waedi diyunu kala pariwarthana yanthra** (translation machine that works) - The passage *mentions* translation machines, but says they aren't always reliable. It doesn't say they are the *cause* of the problem.
* **B: smart jangama durakathanaya** (smart mobile communication) - This is irrelevant to the problem described in the passage.
* **D: thathya kaleena pariwarthana kandaye yedum** (the core of the modern translation) - This is too broad. The passage is pinpointing a specific issue, not the entire system.



"
himakandu kadaa waeteemakata hethuwa nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: aelena sulu hima** (beautiful, subtle snow).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Gaetaluva wanne hima aelena sulu vimayi, enisaa eya pahalata paeminimata yam aarambhayak awashya vena athara samahara pahalata paeminena hima anikvaa aarambha kireeme siduweema da viya haekiya.""  This translates to: ""The snow that falls is beautiful and subtle; it doesn't require any effort to appreciate it, unlike the massive snowfalls that start to bother people.""

* **The question asks:** What is the reason the snowfall isn't considered extraordinary?

The passage directly connects the *beauty and subtlety* of the snowfall to why it's not remarkable. The other options are mentioned in the passage but don't directly answer *why* it isn't considered extraordinary.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, himakandu kadaa waeteemak lesa waetenne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: aarambhayak nomaethi aelena sulu hima** (snow that doesn't require a beginning, just appears as bright light).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a unique kind of snowfall:** It's not ordinary; it appears without a clear starting point (""aarambhayak nomaethi"").  It's described as being like bright light (""aelena sulu hima"").
* **The question asks what kind of snowfall is described.**  Option A perfectly matches this description from the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: hima nomaethi baewum:** (snow that has wind) - While the passage mentions wind with the snowfall, it doesn't *define* the snowfall as being wind-related.
* **C: baewum sahitha pallamwala athiriktha hima:** (extra snowfall with wind) -  This is a characteristic *of* the snowfall, not its defining quality.
* **D: minisun visin sparsha nokarana lada hima:** (snow that's difficult for humans to touch) - The passage doesn't mention difficulty in touching the snow, only that it's far away from humans and appears natural.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, vyanjana padanam wee aeththe kumana amud‍ravya wataada?","The correct answer is **B: awshadha paelaeti saha kulubadu**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""Vyanjanayak yanu **awushadha paelaeti saha kulubadu musu woo**..."" (The dish is made with **spices and meat**...).  This directly identifies the core ingredients.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: yogat saha jalaya (yogurt and water):** While yogurt *might* be used in some variations (as mentioned for South India), it's not a foundational ingredient mentioned for the general dish. Water is a general cooking liquid, not a specific ingredient listed.
* **C: pol kiri saha mas (coconut milk and meat):** Coconut milk is mentioned as being used in *South Indian* variations, but not the dish generally.
* **D: elawalu saha kiri (cardamom and milk):** Cardamom is a spice, but the passage doesn't highlight milk as a key component.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
samahara pradesha wala pol kiri samahara vita vyanjana wala kumana amud‍ravyayak wenuwata bhaavitha karanu laebe da?,"The correct answer is **B: elawalu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""mas ho elavalu deken ekak samaga aethi bhojanayaki."" (It is eaten with one of meat or eggplant.) and ""dakunu indiyava saha ardhadvipaye anek verala kalaapavala boho seyin pol kiri bhaavitha wei."" (In South India and the peninsula, many different vegetable curries are flavored with coconut milk.)

This directly links eggplant (elawalu) to being a common ingredient in curries flavored with coconut milk in South India and the peninsula.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: maansha (meat):** While mentioned as something eaten *with* the curry, it's not specifically tied to coconut milk flavoring.
* **C: yogat (yogurt):** The passage states yogurt is used more in North India and Pakistan.
* **D: kulubadu (mushrooms):** Mentioned in the beginning but not related to coconut milk flavorings.



"

Here's why:

The original text (P) states the journey requires a ""visheshitha traektar valata pamani"" – meaning it *needs* a specialized tractor, equipped with fuel and supplies.  The question (Q) asks what is *necessary* for the journey.

Option C directly contradicts this requirement, stating a specialized tractor is *not* needed.  This is the key point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: maekmardo dumriya sthaanaya boho vita wasaa dama aetha** - This talks about the Makmardo dumping station, which isn't a core necessity for the Antarctic crossing.
*   **B: sanyuktha hima anathurudayaka we** - This mentions combined snowstorms, but weather conditions are a factor *during* the journey, not a fundamental requirement *for* it.
*   **D: eya ros muhuda haraha gaman kirimata wadaa pahasu we** - This talks about travelling across the Russian ocean, again, a part of the route not a core requirement.



"
"dakunu dhraewaya haraha, kodi walin salakunu kara aeththe kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: maekmardo dumriya sthaanayata wu maargaya** (the route from McMurdo to the South Pole).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dakshina draewa maga (ho maha maragaya) maekmardo madyasthaanaye sita ros muhuda osse draevaya desata ki mee 1600 k dive."" - This translates to: ""The South Pole route (or the major route) is a 1600 km drive from McMurdo to the South Pole.""
* The question asks what the South Pole route is.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: indhana raegena yana t‍raektar** (the trajectory with fuel) - While fuel is mentioned as part of the journey, it's not *what* the route *is*.
* **C: hima walin pirunu viwarayan** (descriptions of turning with the snow) -  This describes *how* you navigate, not the route itself.
* **D: kandukaraya wata wu bhayaanaka wangu** (dangerous slopes along the route) - This describes *hazards* on the route, not the route itself.

Here's why:

The passage (P) heavily focuses on the need for visas and permits to travel to different countries when using a motor vehicle. It mentions needing to check visa requirements (""Visa awashyatha saha viyadam ratin ratata venas wana athara oba paeminena rata anuva eya balapaayi"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: motar rathayen sanchaaraya kirima prawesha viya naehaeki sthaana naerabimata honda kramayaki** (a good way to enter places where travel by motor vehicle is prohibited) - The passage discusses *how* to travel, not how to bypass restrictions.
* **C: dakunu aprikaave asalwaesi ratawal siyallama pahe sthaawara ratawal we** (all countries in Southern Africa are permanently habitable) - This isn't the primary focus; the passage is about travel *requirements*.
* **D: motar rathayakin gaman ganne nam 4x4 rathayak nirdesha kere** (a 4x4 vehicle is required if you travel by motor vehicle) - While 4x4 vehicles are mentioned, it's regarding challenging terrains, not a universal requirement for all travel.



Therefore, option A directly addresses the key information provided in the passage."
"mema chedayata anuwa, dakunu aprikaava motar rathayen sanchaaraya kirimata apekshaa karana sanchaarakayinta naraka upadesak lesa saelakiya haekke kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: motar rathaya thula thibiya yuthu samahara hadisi awasthaa ayithama neethyaanukoolawa awashya viya haekiya** (Drivers traveling in the southern province by motor vehicle are required to comply with numerous conditions regarding vehicle weight and condition).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Motor rathaya thula tibiya yuththe kumana hadisi avasthaa ayithamayan da yanna pilibanda saema ratakatama ananya niti regulasi thibe.""  This directly translates to needing to follow rules and regulations regarding vehicle condition and weight.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While 4x4s are mentioned, the passage doesn't state they are *required*. It mentions they *can* access certain difficult terrains.
* **C:** The passage mentions restrictions, suggesting limitations on where you can drive a standard vehicle, not that driving a motor vehicle is particularly allowed.
* **D:**  The passage says drivers need visas and permissions, implying travel *to* the southern province is regulated, not that accessing all areas *within* it is unrestricted.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about what the passage says caused the suspicion.** The passage states: ""Himikaruvek nomaeti malu sorakamak sandaha ilakkayak wana athara bomba tharjana gaena vimasilimat wana baladhaaringe avadhaanayata lakviya haeki ya."" (This attention was drawn to the fact that someone without a known record was suspiciously trying to obtain explosives.)  This directly links the suspicion to being *noted in the document* or *record*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: oba anudaenumakin thorawa mathd‍ravya gena yanneku bawata pathviya haekiya** (You were suspected of trying to leave the country with explosives) - While the passage mentions suspicions about leaving, it doesn't say *this* is what initially raised the suspicion.
* **C: samahara vita eya wenath kenekuge yana vyaakoolathwayata hethu viya haekiya** (It was due to the abnormality of someone trying to leave the country) - This is a consequence of the suspicion, not the cause.
* **D: baladhaareen ewa viya haeki bomba tharjanayak lesa saelakeemata ida aetha** (This is because he was trying to obtain explosives) - Again, this is *what* he was trying to do, but not *why* the suspicion started.  The passage focuses on the *lack of a record* as the initial red flag.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Samahara ratawala palamuvara vaeradivalata pavaa atisaya darunu danduvam pamunu wana athara, mevaata avurudu 10 ta adhika siragata kireem ho maranaya aetulat viya haekiya."" This translates directly to the death penalty being a possible punishment for drug smuggling in many countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:**  The passage mentions crossing borders (""jathyantharawa sanchaaraya"") but doesn't focus on border security measures.
* **C:** This refers to thinking about doing drugs, which is a part of the passage, but not the central point about penalties.
* **D:**  This discusses how authorities might react to someone smuggling drugs, but doesn't state this as a core finding of the passage.

It specifically mentions enjoying a simple drink alongside their daily routine and feeling refreshed.  The question asks what drink *doesn't* cause enthusiasm or excitement.

Considering the descriptions:

* **Coffee (B):** Is mentioned as something enjoyed (""koppayakin puravanna"").
* **Beer (C):** Is also mentioned (""beera"").
* **Tea (D):** Is also mentioned (""the"").
* **Juice (A):** Is *not* mentioned anywhere in the passage.

Therefore, the answer is **A: joos (juice)**. The passage doesn't give any indication of juice being part of their routine or preferences.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...yusha sandaha ho smoothi kihipayak mishra kireeme avasthava labaaganna"" (You might find yourself in a situation where juice or a smoothie is mixed). This directly indicates juice and smoothies are part of the described daily routine and accessible.
* **The question asks:** About prevalent drinks in the city's beverage culture and places to find them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: obe asalwaesi pradeshayen pitatha pihiti kopi alevisael** (Coffee is available from your native region) - The passage mentions coffee, but not as a defining feature of the city's culture or readily available everywhere.
* **C: oba nithara noyana pab** (You regularly drink beer) - While the passage mentions beer, it's presented as something you *might* experience when traveling to different areas, not as a staple of your daily life in the city.
* **D: kaemomayil the hadana awanhal** (There isn't chamomile tea) - The passage *mentions* chamomile tea, but it's in the context of wanting a simple drink, not its absence.



"
parevi moorthi pihita aeththe koheda?,"The correct answer is **B: dewasthaana bhoomiye**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...**Devasthaana bhoomiye samahara sohon koth matha sith gannaa paligu parevi murthi daekiya haekiya.**"" This directly translates to ""On the temple grounds, a beautiful and ancient stone statue of Parvati is installed."" 

Therefore, the Parvati statue is located on the *devasthaana bhoomiye* (temple grounds).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: gamen paeya bhagayaka durin** - Mentions a part of the village, not the statue's location.
*   **C: estooroyi doopathe** -  Not mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: dewasthaanaya thula** -  Not mentioned in the passage.

pramaanawath mudal aadhaarayak sanaatha kirimata yamekuta awashya wanne kumana aakaraye visaa balapathrayakda?,"The correct answer is **D: shish‍ya visaa (student visa)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Sisya visa balapatra sandaha saamaanyayen saamaanya sanchaaraka ho vyaapaarika visa balapatravalin venas awashyathaa saha ayadum kireeme kriyaa patipaati atha.""  This translates to: ""A student visa generally requires different procedures and formalities compared to ordinary tourist or business visas.""

The passage also discusses needing proof of enrollment in an educational institution and acceptance letters, which are all requirements for a student visa.  It focuses on someone coming to study, fitting the description of a *shish‍ya* (student).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: vyaaparika visaa (business visa)** - The passage mentions business visas as *different* from a student visa.
*   **B: sanchaaraka visaa (tourist visa)** - Similar to the business visa, this is mentioned as being different.
*   **C: thaawakalika visaa (temporary visa)** - While a student visa *is* temporary, the passage specifically focuses on the requirements for a student's visa and doesn't broadly discuss temporary visas.



"
deergha visaa balapathrayak illaa siteemata boho durata ida aeththe kawuda?,"The correct answer is **C: jathyanthara shish‍yayeku** (foreign student).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...jaatyantara sisyayeku lesa ehi yaema saamaanyayen aniyam sanchaarakayeku lesa ehi yaemata vadaa waedi kaalayak raendi siteema awashya we.""  This translates to: ""...if you come as a foreign student, you absolutely need a residence permit for the period exceeding the validity of a normal tourist or business visa.""

Therefore, a foreign student is the one who needs a long-term residence permit if staying beyond the standard visa duration.



"
oba visheshayen maduruwan gaena saelakilimath viya yuththe kawadada?,"The correct answer is **C: waesi wanaantharaye** (the forest area).

Here's why:

* **P's statement** describes someone who frequently enters the forest, likely illegally (""paagamanin yamata tiranaya karanne"").  The entire passage revolves around this person's access to the forest (""maduruvangen pravesam weemata sidu vanu aetha"").  The question asks *where* this person specifically goes.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: gimhana maasawaladee (gimhana month):** This is a time period, not a place.
    * **B: kandu naegeemedee (middle of the thorn bush):** While related to a forest, it's too specific and doesn't encompass the overall area of entry.
    * **D: riya padawana atharathura (railway crossing):**  Completely irrelevant to the context.

Therefore, ""waesi wanaantharaye"" (the forest area) is the most logical and direct answer to the question based on the information provided in P.

Here's why:

* **P (the prompt)** describes someone potentially illegally entering a protected area (a forest/wildlife sanctuary) during the dry season. It mentions a vehicle and specifically the *door* of the vehicle being used as a point of entry/exit.  The key phrase is ""...oba waahanaye dora haera eeta aetulu wana thathpara kihipaya pava pramaanavat we."" (meaning something about using the vehicle door as proof).

* **Q (the question)** asks where the illegal entry point *is*.  It's looking for a location related to the vehicle.

* **A (waahanaye dorawal waedi welaawak viwurthawa thaebeema)** translates to ""The area where the vehicle door was opened/used for entry."" This directly addresses the information in P and answers the question in Q.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B (gimhanayedee riya paedaweema):**  ""Entry point in the humid season"" -  The prompt is specifically about the *dry* season.
* **C (upa niwarthanika pradesha haraha riya paedaweema):** ""Entry point in the resettlement area"" -  The prompt doesn't mention resettlement areas.
* **D (kandunagina atharathura waahanaya nosaelakilimath lesa thaebeema):**  ""Entry by a vehicle that doesn't meet the required conditions"" - This is about the *legality* of the vehicle, not the *location* of the entry point.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Sundarbaans yanu lowa visaalatama samudraashritha kadolaana tiruva wana athara..."" which translates to ""Sundarbaans is a vast mangrove forest...""
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **A:** While it *is* a large forest, the passage focuses on it being a mangrove forest first and foremost.
    * **B:** The passage mentions it's a remnant of the Gangetic delta, but doesn't primarily characterize it as land *covered* by water. It's a forest *in* a watery region.
    * **D:** The passage mentions Bengali tigers live there, but doesn’t state that the tigers *inhabit* Bengal.

mema wanaantharaye kumana kotasa indiyanu bhoomi pradeshaya thula pihita thibeda?,"The correct answer is **A: sandarbans jaathika wanod‍yaanaya** (Sundarbans National Park).

Here's why:

The text states: *""indiyaanu deshabhoomiya thula aethi wanaye kotasa sundarbaans jaathika vanodyaanaya lesa haedinve.""*  This translates to: *""In India, the area of this forest is identified as the Sundarbans National Park.""* 

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: wanajiwee abhayabhoomiya** (Wildlife Sanctuary) - While Sundarbans *is* a wildlife sanctuary, the text specifically identifies the national park as the area within Indian territory.
* **C: loka uruma adaviya** (World Heritage Site) -  This is a designation, not a specific land area.
* **D: gangetik thaenna** (Ganga Delta) - This describes the geographical region, not the defined area of Indian land within the Sundarbans.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the diversity of languages spoken globally (over 5,000) and highlights people who speak languages *in addition* to English.**  It specifically mentions people from Toronto, Manchester, Boston, Jamaica, and Sydney, noting they speak with their specific accents and regional dialects. This all points to multilingual individuals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: wayasin adu aya** (an old age) - The passage *contrasts* fluent English speakers (often older) with those who are more limited in English, specifically *younger* people.
* **C: toronto wetha gaman karana pudgalayin** (people traveling to Toronto) - While Toronto is mentioned, the passage isn't about people *going* to Toronto, but rather people *from* various places who speak multiple languages.
* **D: wayasin waedi aya** (an old address) - This is irrelevant to the passage's content.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, uchchaaranaya kirimata apahasu viya haekke kumak da?","The correct answer is **B: lipina**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Boho vita paehaediliwa uchcharanaya kirimata apahasu wana lipinayan sambandhayen meya visesayen sathya we.""  This translates to ""This is especially true regarding the writing system that causes pronunciation to be inaccurate."" 

The passage is discussing how the *written form* (lipina) of languages can lead to mispronunciation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: wenas uchchaaranayak sahitha wachana (spoken language with pronunciation)** - The passage actually *highlights a disconnect* between written form and pronunciation, not a harmonious combination of both.
*   **C: likhitha wachana (written language)** - While related, the passage focuses on the *problem* with the writing system causing mispronunciation, not just the existence of written language itself.
*   **D: desheeya upabhaashawa (regional dialects)** - While the passage mentions regional dialects, the core problem being discussed is how the writing system influences and sometimes hinders accurate pronunciation.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Visesayen naegenahirata saha jakar/bumtaang desata diwena bas ratha 06:30 saha 7:30 athara pitath wana namuth dinaya puraama anthar distrik bas naewathumen (ganga harahaa) bas ratha pitatve."" - This means buses to Naegenahira and Jakar/Bumthang leave between 6:30 and 7:30 in the morning for inter-district travel.
* **The question asks:** For someone wanting to take an inter-district bus, what information is useful for planning?
* **Option A** directly addresses this by stating the passenger needs to consider going towards Jakar and looking for buses leaving around a specific time (implied to be within the 6:30-7:30 window).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** Focuses on Bumthang and a later time (7:00) which isn't the primary planning point given the passage.
* **C:** Mentions Paaro and a completely different time (11:00+), unrelated to the core information about the early morning buses.
* **D:**  Focuses on Naegenahira and an even earlier time (6:20) which isn't the main detail for general inter-district travel.

anthar disthrik bas naewathumpolen naegenahira desata gaman kirimata balaaporoththu wana sanchaarakayakuta honda upadesak wanu aeththe kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: bas ratha pitath wanne 8:30 ta pasuwa pamani** (Buses leave the station after 8:30).

Here's why:

* **The question asks for advice for someone traveling from Naegenahira to another district by bus.** The passage states buses to other districts leave *after* 6:30 and 7:30, and implies a significant number leave later.  8:30 is a reasonable time to go to the station, knowing buses will be departing soon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pera tikat pathak miladee ganna** (Going to buy a ticket beforehand) - While generally good advice, it's not the *best* advice based on the passage. The passage doesn't specifically emphasize pre-purchasing tickets.
* **C: boho bas ratha dawasa puraawatama pitath we** (Many buses run throughout the day) - This is a statement *from* the passage, not advice for a traveler.
* **D: hawul taeksiyakin gaman kirima wadaath buddhimath kramaya viya haekiya** (Taking a Hawul taxi is a smart way to travel) - The passage mentions taxis as an *alternative* (and more expensive) option, not as the best advice.

timbaktu pilibanda niwaeradi vistharayak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **D: eya kuthuhalaya danawana sanchaarakayin sandaha aakarshanayak lesa pawathee** (It attracts tourists with its curious and wonderful appeal).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Timbaktu, sanchaaraka aakarshanayak sahitha guvan thotupolakda sahitha nagarayak vuvat ada eya dilindubhaavayen pidita nagarayak bavata pathwa aetha.""  This directly translates to ""Timbaktu is a city that is attractive to tourists, with fascinating features, and is a city afflicted by beauty.""  This highlights its appeal to travelers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eyata rate sesu pradeshawalata wadaa waediyen araabi balapaemak aetha** (It has a strong Arabian influence in many areas of the country) - While the passage mentions an Arabic influence, it doesn't state it's *strong* or widespread across the country.
* **B: eya dilidu bhawayen peedithayi** (It is afflicted by beauty) - While mentioned, this is a characteristic *of* Timbaktu, not the primary reason people are drawn to it.  It's a poetic description, not a direct answer to *why* tourists visit.
* **C: eyata guvan yanayen prawesha viya nohaeka** (It is not possible to enter with fascination) - The passage implies the opposite – it *is* fascinating and draws people in.



Therefore, option D best reflects the information presented in the passage about what draws people to Timbaktu."
timbaktu pilibanda sathya wanne pahatha sandahan karunu walin kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: meya darid‍rathawata wadaa anija we** (This is a city afflicted by poverty).

* **The passage directly states:** ""Timbaktu, sanchaaraka aakarshanayak sahitha guvan thotupolakda sahitha nagarayak vuvat ada eya **dilindubhaavayen pidita nagarayak bavata pathwa aetha.**""  This translates to ""Timbaktu, though it has attractions for tourists and is filled with beautiful landscapes, is described as a city **afflicted by poverty**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: nagarayata guvan yanayen prawesha viya haekiya** (It is a city accessible with beauty) - While the passage mentions beauty (""guvan thotupolakda""), it focuses more on the hardship of poverty.
* **C: awata nagara walata wadaa ehi aprikaanu swabhawaya aduya** (This city has an African character) - The passage mentions it resembles African landscapes, but doesn't state it *has* an African character. It's a comparison, not a definitive statement.
* **D: nagaraya thawaduratath sanchaarakayin aakarshanaya nokarayi** (The city does not have tourist attractions) - The passage explicitly states it *has* attractions (""sanchaaraka aakarshanayak sahitha"").



Therefore, option B is the most accurate reflection of the information provided in the text."

"mema chedayata anuwa, puneelayak waeni sulangak suli kunaatuvak bawata path wanne kumana awasthaawedee da?","The correct answer is **D: polowa sparsha kirimen pasu**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""...athara eva polova sparsa woo vitam """"kunaatu"""" bavata path we.""  This translates to ""...and this half-touch will lead to the 'kunaatu' state.""  The question (Q) asks what state the cooled sulanga (cooling substance) leads to when it touches 'kunaatu'. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sulanga paeyata saethapum 100k pamana wegayata langaa wana vita:** This refers to the amount of cooling, not the *state* reached.
* **B: wayu theeruwa bhramanaya weemata patan gath vita:** This describes a wind-related process, not the final state.
* **C: kunatu walaakulu walin baesa yana atharathura:**  This talks about the layers of 'kunaatu' but doesn't define the state itself.



Therefore, option D is the only one directly addressed in the passage as the outcome of touching 'kunaatu'."
suli kunaatuvaka niwaeradi lakshanayak wanne mewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: ewa saema vitama paeyata saethapum 100-200 athara sulangak aethi karayi.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly states:** ""Eva adhika sulang (paeyakata saethapum 100-200) aethi karana..."" which translates to ""This often comes with a large amount of dust (approximately 100-200) ...""  This directly describes a characteristic of 'suli kunaatu'.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ewa boho vita bara wasthun samaga gaman karayi** - The passage mentions *mudha* (dust) being carried, not general ""things"" (*bara wasthun*).
* **C: polowa sparsha kirimen pasuwa ewa puneela bawata path we** - While the passage *mentions* something being spread when touched, it isn't a defining characteristic or the main point about 'suli kunaatu'. It's a consequence.
* **D: ewa wathaya pitathata thallu karana bhramanaya wana theeru we** - The passage describes it as a ""column of air,"" not something that falls from the sky (*wathaya pitathata thallu karana*).



Therefore, option A is the most accurate and directly derived from the provided text."
"ema chedayata anuwa, sanchaarakayeku thama gamanaantha nagaraye deshapalana thathwaya sambandhayen upades laba gatha yuththe kothaeninda?","The correct answer is **C: owun sanchaaraya kirimata yana rate purawaesiyangen** (from the inhabitants of the country you travel to).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*ovunge upadeshanaya nirmaanaya wee aeththe ovunge puravaesiyan sandahaa we.*"" This translates to ""...you build your teachings based on the experiences of the inhabitants (of the country).""  The question asks where a communicator gets advice regarding the governing principles of a destination city/country. The passage clearly points to learning from the *purawaesiyan* (inhabitants).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: owun sanchaaraya kirimata yana rate rajayen** (from the government of the country you travel to) - While you might receive instructions *from* the government, the passage emphasizes learning from the people's experiences, not just government directives.
* **B: sanchaaraka upadeshanaya thula idiripath karana lada adahas walin** (from the way communicators usually give advice) - This is about the *manner* of giving advice, not the *source*.
* **D: owungema rajayen** (from your own government) - The passage focuses on gaining knowledge about the *destination* country’s principles, not relying on your own government's perspectives.

Here's why:

The passage states that receiving communication from many countries can be beneficial *if* it helps you protect your well-being and avoid being misled.  It implies that understanding different perspectives can empower you to make informed decisions for your own health and security.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: balapaemata lak wu awalangu kirime rakshanaya** (protecting the ability to speak freely) - While important, the passage focuses on *receiving* information and its impact on *your* well-being, not on the freedom to express yourself.
* **B: rate deshapalana thathwaya pilibanda athishaya sarala saraanshayak** (very simple understandings of a country's governing principles) - The passage actually emphasizes needing *detailed* and *thorough* understanding, not simple ones.
* **D: rate deshapalana thaththwaya pilibanda savistharaathmaka thorathuru** (detailed understandings of a country's governing principles) - This is part of the benefit, but the *primary* benefit is how that understanding protects your well-being and prevents manipulation.

"mema chedayata anuwa, sanchaaraka niyojithayekugen wen karawa gaeneeme sahaya awashya weemata awama idak aeththe kumana aakaraye sanchaarayakata da?","The correct answer is **A: sanchaarakaya meeta pera sanchaaraya kara aethi nagarayaka waeda samuluwakata wana sanchaarayak** (A traveler who travels to cities and villages after meeting the communicator).

Here's why:

The passage describes a ""sanchaaraka niyojitha"" (communicator-appointed person) as someone who travels and shares information about cultures, languages, and income-generating opportunities from different places.  They essentially *spread the word* from the original communicator.  Option A directly reflects this - a traveler going to various locations *after* meeting the original communicator.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: vishesha ayawaeyak sahitha sathi dekaka sanchaarayak** (A traveler who travels with special equipment and spends several days) - While a niyojitha might use equipment or spend time, it’s not the *defining* characteristic. The key is spreading information.
* **C: bhaashamaya badhakayak gena ena sanchaarayak** (A traveler who faces language barriers) - The passage mentions language *as something the niyojitha knows about*, not a barrier they face.
* **D: sanchaarakayekuge palamu videsha sanchaaraya** (The communicator's first foreign travel) - This describes the original communicator, not the *niyojitha* who is appointed to share information.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that a good travel planner (sanchaaraka niyojithaya) provides insights into culture, language, and income levels of the destination.** They help the traveler understand *how* to communicate effectively considering these factors.  Option D directly reflects this - the traveler, *because of the planner*, can communicate with a strong cultural awareness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  Simply being able to travel safely isn't the core benefit described. Safety is implied as a result of good planning, but not the main *advantage*.
* **B:**  Doing special tasks on the first day is not the focus of the passage. The passage is about *how* communication happens, not specific activities.
* **C:**  Being fluent in the local language is helpful, but the planner's role isn't just language instruction. It's broader – understanding the cultural context *along with* language.

"mema chedayata anuwa, nawa sthaana naerabimata sanchaaraya kirimedee balaaporoththu sunweema walakwa gaeneemata sanchaarakayekuta upakara kala haekke kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: owun thama rate parisarayata samana pramitheen apekshaa kirima (expecting standards similar to your own country's environment)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""...ema parisaraya 'thama ratae' de ha samaana novena bavata salakanna."" ( ...you will find this environment is not the same as your own country.)  It then goes on to list all the differences - customs, food, transport, weather, language, etc.
* **The question (Q) asks:** What is helpful for a communicator when moving to a new place?
* **Option A** directly addresses the issue raised in the passage: understanding that things *won't* be the same and adjusting expectations accordingly.  This is crucial for effective communication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: nuhuru aahara athhada baeleemata aethi kaemaeththa (being afraid of new foods or customs):** The passage *mentions* differences in food and customs, but doesn't suggest fear is helpful. It implies acceptance and understanding is needed.
* **C: owun thama ratata samana neethiwalata anugatha weema (following the same legal systems as your country):** The passage mentions differences in laws and customs, not advocating for ignoring local laws.
* **D: nawathaen pilibandawa kalin paryeshana kirimen waelakee siteema (spending time researching the weather):** While researching the weather is *practical*, the passage focuses on the broader cultural and societal differences that impact communication.

"mema chedaye aethi thorathuru matha padanamwa, videsheeya ratakata sanchaaraya karana vita balaaporoththu sunweemak athvindiya haekke kumana aakaraye pudgalayekutada?","The passage (P) discusses the significant impact of communication on culture and lifestyle. It highlights how communication shapes everything from beliefs and food to transportation, climate, language, and even where people choose to live. It also mentions potential frustration and discomfort arising from cultural differences.

The question (Q) asks what *type of person* is most likely to be affected by moving abroad and communicating with foreign countries.

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: videsheeya aahara walata kaemathi kenek (someone fond of foreign food)** - While enjoying foreign food is part of the experience, it's not a core vulnerability.  Someone who likes trying new foods would likely *benefit* from the experience, not be negatively impacted.
* **B: wenasweem matha samurddhimath wana kenek (someone with flexible or broad-minded beliefs)** - This person would be *less* affected, as they are open to new ideas and ways of life.
* **C: sanwurtha manasak aethi kenek (someone with a conservative mindset)** - This is the most likely answer. A conservative mindset implies a strong adherence to familiar traditions and beliefs.  Exposure to dramatically different cultures, as described in the passage, would likely cause discomfort and frustration for someone holding such views.
* **D: igeneemen sathutak labana kenek (someone who receives honors easily)** - This is irrelevant to the impact of cultural communication.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C**.  Someone with a conservative mindset is most likely to experience difficulties adapting to a foreign culture and the communication that comes with it.

This translates to: ""...when you arrive for the first time, do not expect luxurious cultural experiences...You do not have knowledge about the national heritage, do not expect grand things or high-level ideas about the country.""

* **Question asks:** What is the traveler advised *not* to do when arriving for the first time?

* **Option A** directly reflects this advice: ""do not gain knowledge about the national heritage beyond the country's boundaries.""  It speaks to not having pre-conceived notions or expecting a certain level of sophistication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: palamu dina kihipaya thula aahara naasthiyen walakinna** (There isn't much food on the first day) - The passage mentions good food and service, not a lack thereof.
* **C: kandawuru baendeemedee sayaanayak ho ellena aendak nirdesha kere** (Give directions to the Kandawuru bend) - This is about a specific location and not a general piece of advice.
* **D: oba palamu warata paeminena vita usas thaththwaye hotalayaka wen karawa ganna** (You will be sent to a hot hotel in a hasty manner on the first day) - This isn’t mentioned in the passage.

* **The question asks:** What is important to follow when developing a country, according to the passage?  The passage specifically highlights *service* as a key component of development related to tourism and cultural enrichment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: batahira aakaraye aahara (beautiful appearance and food):** While mentioned, they aren't presented as the primary *thing to follow* during development.
* **C: kandawuru baendeema sandaha mettayak ho thunee kottayak (understanding of local traditions/beliefs):** This is discussed as *something you don't have* if you're not developing properly, not something to *follow* in development.
* **D: gunathmaka hotal (quality hotel):**  Again, a component, but not the overarching principle of following quality *service*.

This translates to: ""If you are communicating with a laptop or tablet, close the lid or turn it off (even if it doesn't disconnect from the internet).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sanchaaraka sahakaruta pitapathak laba deema** (Get help from communication collaborators to get the password) - The text mentions collaborators *receiving* the password, not *giving* help to get it.
* **B: thamantama pitapathak eemelayen yaeweema** (Send the password to the parents via email) - This is the opposite of what the text suggests; it's about protecting the password.
* **D: klawud thula pitapathak gabadaa kirima** (Give the cloud folder to the parents) - While the text mentions ""klawud"" (cloud), it's in the context of *securing* it, not handing it over.



Therefore, option C directly reflects the instruction in the original text regarding protecting the password when using devices."

This translates to ""Instructions/opportunities and **evidence of scams, they are involved in the electronic mail of those protecting and international disaster numbers** are gathered.""

The question asks what you *don't* need to show when following security protocols.  The passage directly states that evidence of scams and disaster numbers *are* gathered, making this the thing you *don't* need to show proactively.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: rakshana samaagame eemel lipinaya** -  The passage discusses electronic mail *related to* those providing protection, it doesn't say you need to *show* a security team's email.
* **C: awasara laba gaeneema sandaha jathyanthara durakathana anka** - While opportunities and scams are mentioned, the passage doesn't say you don't need to show evidence of scams related to opportunities.
* **D: rakshana oppuhimiyage eemel lipinaya** -  The passage talks about emails *connected to* protection providers, not necessarily emails *from* those providing protection.

This translates to: ""The overall medium format camera is 6 x 6 centimeters, but to achieve better results, consider 56 x 56 images.""

The question asks about the aspect ratio for better quality images, and the passage clearly indicates **56 x 56** is preferable.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sammatha mi mee 35 patala (mi mee 36 sita 24 rina) boho vita sulabha we."" and later references a 4x difference in resolution compared to this.  The question asks for the equivalent to a DSLR, and the 35mm film format is the closest equivalent mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: madhyama-aakruthi chithrapata (Medium-format photography):** The text mentions 6x6 cm as a medium format, but doesn't directly equate it to the DSLR equivalent.
* **C: mi.mee. 56 x 56 patala:**  This format is introduced *after* discussing the 35mm and is described as an extension/variation, not a base equivalent.
* **D: se.mee. 6 x 6 patala:**  This is specifically identified as a *medium-format* film size, and while it offers high resolution, it isn't presented as the equivalent to a DSLR in the context of the passage.

Here's why:

* **The original text (P) describes a situation where someone wants to start a travel writing business.** They're looking for a way to test their skills and get started.  The passage specifically mentions needing to *demonstrate* their ability.
* **Option B directly addresses this need.** Writing a sample post for a well-known travel blog is a perfect way to showcase their writing skills to potential clients and get feedback.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: web haedathala gaenweema puhunu wanna (refreshing a website heading)** - While website work might be *part* of the business, it doesn't test the *writing* skills.
    * **C: obema web adaviyak godanaganna (selling your own website)** - This doesn't test writing skills, and isn't the initial step to starting a *writing* business.
    * **D: obe sanskarana kusalatha wardhanaya kara ganna (improving your editing skills)** - Editing is important, but this doesn't test the core writing ability.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: blogkaranaya (blogging)**.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: web haedathala gaenweema (creating a website)** - While important, the passage says *starting a blog* is the *first* step. A website might come later.

This translates to: ""Those who depend on warm climates generally find it difficult to adapt to several conditions when they go to cold climates, but it's not entirely impossible.""

Therefore, the passage directly links *badavael aashritha gaetalu* (those who depend on warm climates) with *unusum deshaguna* (warm climates).

* **Translation:** ""...those with weakened immune systems are more susceptible to bacterial infections, and vulnerable populations are more likely to be severely affected and experience complications.""

The question asks what kind of people are particularly vulnerable to the described situation. The passage clearly identifies ""badawael aashritha gaetalu"" (vulnerable populations) as being at higher risk.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: desheeya vishabeeja** (local seeds) - This is mentioned but isn't the *population* at risk.
* **C: shwasana gaetalu** (respiratory systems) -  While the passage discusses breathing, it's talking about *how* the bacteria affect people, not *who* is vulnerable.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Shengen area allows for relatively easy travel between countries.  It then mentions that typically, you don't need a visa for each country you visit, *and* that travel control measures are lessened. However, it *does* say you might need to present multiple visas.  This directly aligns with option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: mudal ithiri kirima** (meaning: reducing costs) - While costs are mentioned (""mudal saha lekhana katayutu ithiri we"" - costs and documentation are reduced), it's not the primary point about travel *within* the Schengen area.
* **C: bahu videsha gaman balapathra murapolawal walakwa gaeneema** (meaning: getting many foreign travel documents) -  The passage focuses on visas *within* the Schengen area, not documents for travel *to* it.
* **D: videsha gaman balapathra awashyathawayak nomaetha** (meaning: foreign travel documents are not necessary) -  The passage states that visas aren't needed for *each* country, but doesn't say they are entirely unnecessary. You may still need a visa to *enter* the Schengen area initially.

tootankhaamunge sohon geya thula thawaduratath soyagatha nohaeki de kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: samahara saerasili (a wealth of treasures)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sohongeyi thibu vismayajanaka vastu thavaduratat e thula nomaeti namuth, eva kayiro hi eegypthu kawutukaagaaraya wetha yavaa aetha.""  This translates to ""Though it is not known what the contents of Tutankhamun's tomb were, it is said to have been a wealth of treasures like anything found in an Egyptian warehouse.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: mameeyage hisa (mother's share):** The passage doesn't mention anything about a mother's share.
* **C: mamiyage urahis (mother's heart):** The passage doesn't mention anything about a mother's heart.
* **D: dhanaya (gold):** While there was gold *within* the treasures, the passage describes the tomb's contents as a broader ""wealth of treasures"" – not just gold.

"mema chedayata anuwa, mila gaena saelakilimath sanchaarakayinta awama washayen aakarshaneeya wanne kumana waenkuwar gamanaanthayada? ","The correct answer is **D: vistlar**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""vislar 2010 sheetha olympik ulela paewaethweema hetuven mila adhika namuth ithaa prasiddhaya.""  This translates to ""Whistler became famous because it hosted the 2010 Winter Olympics."" The question asks which location is attractive to tourists.  Whistler's hosting of the Olympics makes it a popular destination.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: graenvil doopatha:**  The text mentions Graenvil doopatha as a place *Venkuvar Sita* visited, but doesn't suggest it's a major tourist draw.
*   **B: see tu skayi pethmaga:** The text mentions this place but doesn't specifically state it's a popular tourist destination. It's described as a difficult climb.
*   **C: bowen doopatha:** Similar to Graenvil doopatha, it's a location visited by *Venkuvar Sita* but not presented as a significant attraction.

"mema chedayata anuwa, sanchaarakayinta avyaaja waenkuwar athdaekeemak laba deemata boho durata ida aethi gamanaanthaya kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: vistlar**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""vislar 2010 sheetha olympik ulela paewaethweema hetuven mila adhika namuth ithaa prasiddhaya."" (Vistlar became famous because it hosted the 2010 Winter Olympics).  The question asks where the popular location is that the group travels to. The text directly links the journey to Vistlar.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: bowen doopatha:** While mentioned at the beginning, it's the starting point, not the destination.
*   **C: waenkuwar nagara madhyaya:** This refers to the city center where the traveler, Sita, is from, not the destination.
*   **D: graenvil doopatha:** Mentioned as a location Sita passes through, but not the ultimate destination.

"mema chedayata anuwa, sanchaarakayin badhaa rahitha dasun soyanne nam aella naerambiya yuththe kawadada?","The correct answer is **C: jala parimawa ihala mattamaka pawathina vita** (during the period when the water level is very high).

Here's why:

The passage states that the falls are most spectacular (and therefore most attractive to tourists) when the water volume is *very high* (""jala parimaava vadaa ihala yanu aethi athara"").  It also mentions this happens between November and March. The question asks about the best time to visit *without difficulty* – the implication is finding the time when the falls are at their peak.  A high water level makes for a grander, more impressive experience, even though it might be more misty and wet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: nowaembar sita maarthu dakwa** (November to March) - While this is *when* the falls are best, it doesn't address the ""unobstructed view"" aspect of the question.
*   **B: sanchaaraka samaya thula** (tourist season) - This is too general.  Tourist seasons vary. The passage is specifying the *best* time within that season.
*   **D: waesi samayen pitatha** (during the dry season) - The passage explicitly states the falls are *less* spectacular during the dry season.



"
"mema chedayayata anuwa, nowaembar saha maarthu athara viktoriya diya aella naerabimen laebena wasi monawada?","The correct answer is **D: waesi samayen waelakee siteema** (the limitations of the wet season).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Vaesi samaye dee (novaembar sita maarthu dakva), jala parimaava vadaa ihala yanu aethi athara, diya aella vadaa camatkaarajanaka vanu aetha.""  This translates to: ""During the wet season (November to March), the water level rises greatly, and the waterfall is very spectacular.""  However, the passage *also* implies limitations due to this high water level - the spray can be intense and potentially dangerous (""eva pradhaanatha ma sanchaaraka aakarshanaya wana namuth..."").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: diya aelle baadhaa rahitha dasun** (the unobstructed view of the waterfall) - The passage hints at potential obstructions due to spray.
* **B: adu sanchaarakayan** (the tourists) - While tourists are mentioned, the question asks about a seasonal limitation, not about the tourists themselves.
* **C: diya aelle chamathkaarajanaka dasuna** (the spectacular view of the waterfall) -  While true, the passage also points to challenges during this time.



Therefore, the wet season (November to March) brings limitations to viewing Victoria Falls due to the high water levels and resulting spray."
"mema chedayata ,d‍ronayak bhaavithayen roogatha kirimedee nirdesha nokaranne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: obata patigatha kirimata awasara aethi de kalthiya pareekshaa kirima** (If you need to get injured to test the methods, do a preliminary examination).

Here's why:

The original text (P) explicitly states: ""Dronayak bhaavitha karanne nam, obata rugatha kirimata avasara aeththe monaava da saha eyata awashya anumaethin ho athireka balapatra monavaa da yanaadiya kaltiyaa ma hondin parikshaa karaganna."" This translates to ""If you consider using a drone, first do a preliminary examination to see if you need to get injured and also whether you need additional permits/approvals.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: amathara balapathra laba gaeneema** (Get an official permit) - While permits *might* be necessary (mentioned in the text), it's not the *first* step outlined.
*   **C: paryeshana balapathra** (Research documents) - The text doesn't specifically mention research documents as an immediate action.
*   **D: d‍ronaya pilibandawa saelakilimathad noviya haeki adu janaakeerna pradeshawala pamanak roogatha kirima** (Get injured by a drone in a publicly known area where drone knowledge is lacking) - This is a misinterpretation and a dangerous suggestion, contrary to the text's emphasis on *preventing* injury through examination.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, d‍ronayak bhaavithayen roogatha kirimata hondama sthaana koheda?","The correct answer is **C: d‍ronaya aduwen penena karyabahula sthaanawala** (places where drone operation is permitted and are busy).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dronayak bhaavitha karanne nam, obata rugatha kirimata avasara aeththe monaava da saha eyata awashya anumaethin ho athireka balapatra monavaa da yanaadiya kaltiyaa ma hondin parikshaa karaganna."" (If you intend to fly a drone, you must carefully examine regulations and necessary permits, and also busy areas where drones are allowed to land.)  This directly implies that busy, permitted areas are where landing is possible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: awata sitina aya d‍ronayak thibeema pilibandawa karadara nowana thaena** (places where there is no information about drone landing) - The passage doesn't focus on lack of information, but rather finding *suitable* spots.
* **B: saaman‍yayen chayaroopa gaeneemata awasara naethi pradeshawala** (areas where there is generally no opportunity to land) -  This is the opposite of what the passage implies. The passage is about finding *where* you *can* land.
* **D: e sandaha oba pera awasara laba gath pradeshawala** (areas where you can get assistance from this message) - The passage is giving instructions, not offering assistance in specific locations.

"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, visaa balapathra kriyaawaliya sandaha liyapadinchi weeme awashyathawaya pilibanda sathya nowana prakaashaya kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: siyaluma ratawala pradeshee baladhaareen samaga liyaapadinchi weema awashya we** (You must have insurance with local authorities in all countries).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""samahara ratawala, oba pradeshiya baladhaarin samaga nawathee sitina sthaanaya saha lipinaya liyapadinci kala yutuya."" (In all countries, you must have insurance with local authorities where you are staying).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't say insurance is *not* needed if you travel with a travel agent. It mentions travel agents needing insurance as well (""Anekuth avastha valadi, sanchaaraka navaathaenvalin pitatha naewathee sitinnan pamanak liyaapadinci weema awashya we."").
* **C:** While the passage mentions submitting documents to the immigration office, it doesn’t say *having* insurance requires going to the immigration office.  It says documents are *submitted* there.
* **D:** The passage mentions hotels but focuses on the insurance requirement with *local authorities*, not specifically hotel insurance.

sanchaarakayakuta owunge liyapadinchi weeme kriyawaliya haesiraweemata ya haeki sthaanayak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: pradesheeya polis sthaanayak (the local police station)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Me sandaha erata polisiya samaga aakruthi pathrayak piravimata ho aagamana karyalaya wetha yamata sidu viya haeka."" (This complaint needs to be submitted with supporting documents to the police or the immigration office).  However, it *immediately* follows that statement with ""Evaeni nitiyak pawathina boho ratawala ehi hotel visin liyaapadinciya sidu karanu laebe"" (Often, those who have written complaints have stayed in hotels in many countries).  This connects the need to report to the *local* police due to potentially being a traveler/foreigner. 

The passage further implies the need to report to the police because of potential issues with travel documents (""sanchaaraka navaathaenvalin pitatha naewathee sitinnan pamanak liyaapadinci weema awashya we."" -  It may be necessary to obtain a statement from a traveler who doesn't have travel documents). Therefore, the *first* point of contact is the local police station.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: owun naewathee sitina hotalaya (the hotel where you stayed):** While the hotel might be involved, it's not where you *submit* the complaint.
* **C: pradesheeya thaepael kaaryaalayak (the regional postal office):** This is irrelevant to the situation.
* **D: aagamana vigamana kaaryaala (the immigration office):** The passage lists the immigration office as *an alternative* to the police, not the primary place to report.



"
sanchaaraya karana atharathura swechcha sewayen prayojana noganu aeththe kawuda?,"The question asks: ""Why shouldn't one engage in communication/interaction through desire or choice?""

Let's break down the original text (P) to understand the context:

* **It talks about a desirable path (honda kramayaki)** – involving serving willingly, understanding cultures, embracing new individuals, understanding oneself, contemplating views, and getting to know new people.
* **It warns against a path driven by desire (kaamarayak saha kihipayak)** – stating that if driven by desire or craving, it can lead to ruin and is not a good way to approach things (""baevin, yam kisi sthaanayaka waedi kaalayak raendi siteema sandaha viyadama sakasuruvam kirimata eya honda kramayak we"").

Now let's look at the options:

* **A: videshagathawa sitina vita nawa mithuran aethi kara gaeneemata balaaporoththu wana kenek** -  Someone who facilitates meeting new friends while living abroad.  This doesn't relate to *why* desire-driven interaction is bad.
* **B: ihala waetupak soyana kenek** - Someone who enjoys high-level satisfaction. This also doesn't address the core of the warning.
* **C: nawa nipunathawayak laba gaeneemata balaaporoththu wana ayek** - Someone who facilitates gaining new skills.  Again, doesn't explain *why* desire-driven interaction is problematic.
* **D: kaamaraya ha nawaathaena pilibandawa unanduwak daekviya haeki kenek** - Someone who is obsessed with desire and craving. **This is the closest answer.** The original text warns that a path led by desire (kaamaraya) and craving (nawaathaena) is a path to ruin. This option describes someone consumed by those things, highlighting the negative consequence.

**Therefore, the correct answer is D.**  The text implies that interactions driven by desire are harmful because they lead to obsession and ultimately a negative outcome.

"mema chedayata anuwa, seemitha ayawaeyak sahitha sanchaarakayin sandaha videshayan hi swechcha sewayata idiripath weemen laebena wasi monawada?","The correct answer is **A: waetupak saema vitama pahe laba denu laebe (it's possible to get something even if it's not fully accepted)**.

Here's why:

* **The Passage's Core Idea:** The passage discusses willingly engaging in a variety of activities – learning, adapting to new cultures, self-reflection, embracing new ideas – even if there's no guarantee of a reward or clear benefit. It emphasizes the value of voluntary service and self-improvement.  It notes that even if desires (like love/affection) aren't fully met, the *process* itself is worthwhile.

* **The Question:** The question asks if engaging with communication and foreign cultures through voluntary service can lead to *something* beneficial, even if it's limited.

* **Why A is best:** Option A directly reflects the passage's spirit. The passage acknowledges that full acceptance or ideal outcomes aren't guaranteed (""yam kisi sthaanayaka waedi kaalayak raendi siteema sandaha viyadama sakasuruvam kirimata eya honda kramayak we"" - even if it doesn't lead to a specific place or time, it's still a good way).  Getting *something* back – even if it's not everything desired – is possible and valuable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: eya saaman‍yayen raekiya awasthaawan hata manga padayi (it falls short even in normal circumstances):** This is too negative. The passage doesn't suggest failure is inevitable.
* **C: kaamaraya saha naawathaen samahara vita pirinamanu laebe (you will get complete fulfillment of desires and dislikes):**  This is the opposite of what the passage suggests.  It explicitly states desires may *not* be fully met.
* **D: eya obata idiri darshanayak laba gaeneemata upakaree we (it will be helpful to get a good vision for yourself):** While self-discovery *could* be a result, it's not the central theme. The passage is broader than just self-vision; it's about the value of engagement itself.

"mema chedayata anuwa, wolt disni warld wetha yana saaman‍ya gamane advitheeya yaeyi saelakiya haekke kumak da?","The correct answer is **A: ud‍yaana gaweshanaya karamin sathiyak gatha kirima (Finding ways to get into the park for free/cheaply)**.

Here's why:

The text (P) describes people looking for discounted or free Disney World tickets through online marketplaces (eBay, Craigslist) and potentially exploiting loopholes (""paak-hoper pravesha pathra"").  The passage warns that using altered or resold tickets is risky (""enam pravesha pathra maaru kala nohaeki ya"").  This clearly points to people trying to find *ways to get into the park without paying full price*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: sthaaneeya nowana hotalayaka nawathaen gaeneema (Staying at nearby hotels):** While the text *mentions* hotels, it's not the central theme.  It's about getting *into* the park, not where to stay.
* **C: disni parish‍raya thula mulu gamanama viyadam kirima (Planning a Disney vacation on a budget):**  This is too broad. The text focuses on a very specific, and potentially risky, method of trying to save money on park admission.
* **D: guvanthotupale sita hotalayata bas rathayak laba gaeneema (Getting a bus route to a nearby hotel):** This is a minor detail and not the primary concern discussed in the passage.



"
wolt disni warld pilibanda sathya nowanne pahatha sandahan prakaashawalin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **D: bahu dina tikatpath boho vita wendesi web adavi walin soyagatha haekiya** (Many-day tickets were obtained by purchasing from resale web ads).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Bohu dina paak-hoper pravesha pathra we. Bohovita saamaanya katayuttak wana meya, disni visin thahanam kara aetha: enam pravesha pathra maaru kala nohaeki ya.""  This translates to ""There were many-day tickets. This is a common fraud, Disney warns: these tickets are not valid.""  This directly confirms tickets were being sold through resale websites (Ebay, Craigslist).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: pak-hopar tikatpath wenath sanchaarakayin wetha maru kala haekiya** (Park tickets are changed by the communications media) - The passage doesn't focus on *changing* tickets, but on *invalid* resold tickets.
* **B: sthaanaye nawathaen pahasukam aetha** (There is happiness even without location) - This is completely unrelated to the content of the passage.
* **C: guvan thotupale sita parish‍raya dakwa sanchaarakayin prawaahanaya kirima sandaha bas ratha aetha** (The communications conveyed regarding the governor's attention to the tourism stream) - While the passage mentions Orlando's international airport, it doesn't focus on the governor or tourism streams.  It's about ticket fraud.



Therefore, option **D** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage."
"mema chedayata anuwa, boho durata wurththeeya puhunu panthiyaka ho prakaashanaye dee aawaranaya nowanne pahatha daekwena vishayayangen kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: yuda kalaapa soodaanama** (युद्ध कलाप सूचनामा - Information about war tactics).

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states that the text being described deals with war tactics (""Yuddha kalaapayak""). It mentions things like strategic areas, detailed explanations, practical aspects, and weaponry.  The question (Q) asks what the text mainly covers. Therefore, information about war tactics is the most accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: wanaanthara thula paewaethma** (வனாந்தர துல பேவத்ம - things related to forests) - While mentioned briefly, it's not the *main* focus.
* **B: prathamaadhaara soodaanama** (பிரதமாத்ஹாரா சூடானம - information about sources) - Sources are mentioned, but it’s not the central topic.
* **D: bhoomikaa ranganaya** (பூமிகா ரங்கனய - stage roles) - This is a component *within* the war tactics, not the overall topic.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, wurththeeya puhunu panthiyaka aawaranaya kirimata boho durata ida aeththe pahatha sandahan vishayayangen kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: yuddha kalaapaya (war tactics)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses heavily on ""yuddha kalaapayak"" (war tactics)** - describing how they are learned, the duration of training, the equipment used, and the limited publication available on the topic. The entire passage *is* about war tactics.
* **Prathamaadhaara (sources/references)** are *used in* learning war tactics, but aren't the central topic.
* **Wanaanthara thula paewaethma (forest camouflage)** is a *part* of war tactics, a specific skill, but not the overall subject.
* **Sathuru parisarayan (enemy surroundings)** are important *to* war tactics, but again, not the main focus.

The question asks what the passage is broadly about, and the clear answer is war tactics (""yuddha kalaapaya"").



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, jalaya apavithra weemen walakwa gaeneema sandaha wana hondama vikalpaya kumakda?","The question asks for the best way to deal with contaminated water due to a leak. Let's break down the original passage (P) to understand the context.

The passage describes a situation where different shaped particles are entering the water supply, and a specific filtering system is needed. It also mentions that a certain amount of time (minutes) is required for the filter to work effectively, and that dealing with the leakage will involve understanding the system.

Now let's look at the options:

* **A: miniththu kihipayak sandaha jalaya unu karanna** (Boil water for a few minutes) - Boiling is a good general disinfection method, but doesn't address the *physical* contamination with particles mentioned in the passage.
* **B: bothal kala jalaya miladee ganna** (Collect water from a bottle) -  This is a temporary solution but doesn't solve the problem of the contaminated source.
* **C: ek miniththuwak sandaha jalaya unu karanna** (Boil water for one minute) -  Even less effective than boiling for ""a few minutes,"" and still doesn't address the particle issue.
* **D: nishchitha tharjana pilibandawa jalaya aegayeemata lak karanna** (Mark the water source with specific instructions) - This is the **most logical answer** based on the passage.  The passage emphasizes understanding the *specific* filter and the time it takes to work. Marking the source with instructions about the contamination and the need for filtration aligns with the need for a targeted and informed approach. This helps prevent others from using the contaminated water *before* it's been properly filtered.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D**.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, daksha pihinumkaruwanta pawaa kala nohaeki viya haekke kumak da?","The correct answer is **C: diyaraeliwalata erehiwa pihineema** (feeling delighted to see the waterfall).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""diyaraelivalata erehiva pihinimata uthsaaha kireemen aetivana tehettuva hetuveni"" - which translates to ""the reason for the excitement of being delighted to see the waterfall.""  The entire passage describes a joyful experience centered around observing a beautiful waterfall.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: galpara walata aasannawa pihineema** (feeling delighted to be near the rocks) - While rocks are mentioned, the primary focus is on the waterfall.
* **B: gaemburu jalaye pihineema** (feeling delighted by the elephant's fire) - Elephants and fire are not mentioned in the text.
* **D: rala wataa pihineema** (feeling delighted by the path) - The path is only a means to *reach* the waterfall, not the source of delight itself.



"
oba diya raellakata hasu wuwahoth oba kumak kala yuthuda?,"The correct answer is **B: diya raellata erehiwa wegayen pihinanna** (to be happy even when facing difficulties in life).

Here's why:

The passage (P) emphasizes finding joy and enthusiasm *despite* life's hardships (""boho vita galparayaka,"" ""naewatha galaa yana raellayi""). It talks about finding strength and purpose even in the face of death (""boho marana siduvanne"").  The core message is about maintaining a positive outlook and inner peace regardless of circumstances.

Option B directly reflects this sentiment – being happy *even when* facing difficulties (""erehiwa wegayen"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: wenath dishawak ilakka kara ganimin diya raellen pitathata yamata uthsaha karanna, pasuwa naewatha weralata pihinanna** (to be enthusiastic about what happens after overcoming difficulties, and also to be happy with what is) - This focuses too much on *overcoming* difficulties, rather than finding joy *within* them, which is the passage's key theme.
* **C: prathiviruddha dishawata pihinanna** (to be happy facing the world) - This is too broad and doesn't capture the specific struggle against hardship described in the text.
* **D: jala mathupitata yatin pihinanna** (to be happy even when being betrayed by friends) - This is a specific situation, while the passage speaks to a universal experience of hardship.

"mema chedayata anuwa, balakotuwakata sanchaaraya kirimama watinaa niwadu vinoda chaarikawak viya haekke kumana sthaanayeda?","The correct answer is **C: rayin nimnaye**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) specifically mentions ""rayin nimnaye saha loyir nimnaya"" (railway lines and lorry lines) as places where congestion happens due to increased traffic.  The question (Q) asks where traffic congestion is likely to occur. Therefore, ""rayin nimnaye"" (railway lines) is the most direct answer from the provided text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: daenub dige nagarayak** (cities to the east) - The passage mentions eastern cities as destinations, but not as congestion *points*.
* **B: eeri aela asala** (near the river area) - While the passage talks about waterways, it doesn't link them to congestion.
* **D: onaema miridiya jala maargayak asala** (other watery routes) - Same as above, waterways are mentioned but not connected to congestion in this context.

"mema chedayata anuwa, pradeshaye sanchaaraya karana kaanthavanta sudusu upadesak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: viwahaka aviwahaka thaththwaya saakachcha kirimen walakinna** (meaning: engaging with both married and unmarried individuals).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Kaantava: vivaahaka avivaahakatvaya nosalakaa, saema kaantha sanchaarakayekma vivaahaka yaeyi paewaseema nirdesitaya."" This translates to: ""The groom: does not discriminate between married and unmarried, and this groom is directed to treat married women with respect.""  This directly addresses interacting with both groups.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: sanskruthika wenaskam desheeya janathawage daedi haesireemata hethu viya haeki bawa karunawen salakanna** (meaning: acknowledging that cultural customs can be a reason for the feelings of the local people) - While cultural context is *mentioned* in the passage, it's not the core advice about how the groom should behave.
* **C: deepthimath aabharana paelandeemen walakinna** (meaning: engaging in offering valuable gifts) - The passage mentions *upakaara* (favors/benefits) but not specifically valuable gifts.
* **D: awashya wita daedi bawa penwanna** (meaning: needing to understand the feelings of others) -  Empathy is implied, but not the direct focus of the advice given to the groom.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer, as it directly reflects the instruction provided in the passage regarding the groom's interactions with both married and unmarried individuals."
"mema chedaye visthara kara aethi pradeshaya matha padanamwa, kaantha sanchaarakayin sandaha prayojanawath ingiyak wanu aeththe kumak da?","The correct answer is **B: viwahaka bawa sankethawath kirima sandaha vishaala muddak palandinna** (roughly translates to: ""expanding the search with the indication of being married, covering a wider area"").

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where a woman is looking for a partner.** The key information is she's open to both married and unmarried men, and specifies a desire for a certain type of married man (one with a willing wife).  This implies she's broadening her search criteria.
* **Option B directly addresses this broadened search.** It suggests the search expands *because* of the openness to married men.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: luhubaendeema saaman‍ya deyak nowana bawa handunaa gaeneema** (roughly translates to: ""It's not a common thing to find happiness in simple things"") - This is a general statement and doesn't relate to the specifics of the passage.
* **C: sanskruthika wenaskam awabodha kara gaeneema yanu obe sthaawaraye siteemen waelakee sitiya yuthu bawayi** (roughly translates to: ""Understand the cultural context, and your position will be clear if you consider your husband's approval"") - While cultural context is mentioned, this focuses on the husband's approval, not the woman's search expansion.
* **D: anawashya luhubaendeemak aethi awasthaawaka, oba purushayin sthira lesa prathikshepa karanna** (roughly translates to: ""In this unnecessary situation, you should reject men firmly"") - This is completely contradictory to the passage's description of a woman *actively searching*.



Therefore, **B** is the only answer that logically follows from the provided text."
"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, wanajiwee chayaroopa shilpiyekuta vishesha kachayak bhaavitha kirimata awashya viya haekke kumana awasthaaweda?","The correct answer is **B: chayaroopa waanijamaya aramunu sandaha bhaavitha karanne nam (if the sculpture reflects the commercial purpose of the forest garden)**.

Here's why:

The passage heavily discusses the *commercial purposes* connected to forest gardens (""samahara avasthaavaladi vanodyaanavala waanijamaya aramunu sandaha jaaayarupa gaeneema pilibanda niti rithi pawathee"").  It implies a sculptor working with forest garden materials would need to consider these commercial implications when creating their art.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: owun visheshayen kudaa jiween chayaroopa gatha karanne nam (if one specifically creates a sculpture based on living creatures):** While the passage mentions wildlife, it doesn't prioritize *specifically* sculpting living things.
* **C: chayaroopa gatha karanu labana sathun laejjasheelee nam (if creating the sculpture is done shyly):** The passage describes the forest garden as sometimes ""shameful"" or ""aggressive"", referring to its qualities, not the sculptor's process.
* **D: wanod‍yaanayakata wanajiwee chayaroopakaranaya sambandhayen vishesha neethireethi thibe nam (if there are specific ethical considerations regarding wildlife sculpture for forest gardens):**  The passage *mentions* ethics, but it frames them around the *commercial* aspects of the forest garden, not just general wildlife sculpting ethics.



Therefore, the most logical connection to the passage's emphasis is the sculptor needing to consider the commercial purpose of the forest garden when creating their work."
wanajiwee chayaroopa shilpeenta aethi viya haeki abhiyogayak lesa chedaye sandahan kara nomaeththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: nishchitha videsheeya sathun soya gaeneema** (engaging in certain foreign seed production).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Boho videsiya sathun soyaagaeneema asiru kaaryayak wana athara, samahara avasthaavaladi vanodyaanavala waanijamaya aramunu sandaha jaaayarupa gaeneema pilibanda niti rithi pawathee.""  This translates to ""Those who engage in certain foreign seed production are subject to regulations regarding seed shape for commercial purposes in forest gardens.""

The question asks what kind of accusation leads to investigating seed shape. The passage directly links foreign seed production to the scrutiny of seed shape.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: aakramanasheelee sathun samaga katayuthu kirima** (fighting with aggressive seeds) - The passage mentions seeds being shy or aggressive, but doesn't link this to investigation.
* **C: awashya kaacha wargaya laba gaeneema** (obtaining necessary raw materials) -  While raw materials are mentioned, they are a *requirement* for investigation, not the *cause* of it.
* **D: anathurudayaka parisarayaka waeda kirima** (trespassing on uninhabited environments) - This is a general description of the setting and isn't connected to the accusation.

kandu mankada haraha gaman karana riyadurekuta awama gaetalu aethi karanne pahatha sandahan karunu walin monawada?,"The passage discusses how ice and snow affect driving conditions, specifically reducing traction (friction) and visibility. The question asks what prevents a driver from easily controlling a vehicle on a snowy/icy road.

Let's break down the options:

* **A: adhika waahana thadabadaya (excessive vehicle speed):** While speed *contributes* to loss of control, it's not the *primary* reason.  You can go slow and still lose control on ice.
* **B: adu gharshanaya (lack of friction):** This is the core issue described in the passage. Ice and snow reduce the grip between the tires and the road, making it hard to steer and brake.
* **C: adhika ghaneebhawanaya (excessive density):** Density isn't the key factor. It's the *slippery* nature of ice/snow.
* **D: adu drushyathawa (lack of visibility):** Reduced visibility is a problem, but doesn’t directly prevent control of the vehicle like loss of traction does.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: adu gharshanaya (lack of friction)**.  The passage explicitly states that friction is reduced by ice and snow, causing difficulty in controlling the vehicle.

vividha ratawala aadayam badu sambandhayen sthaawarawa paewathiya haekke kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: anupaatha (disproportionate)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Aadayam badhu ek ek ratawalata venas lesa vyuhaatmaka wana athara **anupaathikayan** saha seemawan ek ratakin thavat ratakata behevin venas we.""  This translates to ""Income distribution is not strategic, but **disproportionate** and limited to certain regions.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: vyuhaya (strategic):** The passage explicitly says it's *not* strategic.
* **C: oba gonu karana thaena (the place you count):** This is irrelevant to the topic of income distribution.
* **D: warahan (inheritance):**  This has no connection to the context of the passage.



Therefore, **anupaatha (disproportionate)** is the term used in the passage to describe how income is distributed among different regions."
"mema chedayata anuwa, oba videshayanhi waeda karana namuth wenath thaenaka sitee nam, oba obe aadayam badu gonu karanne koheda?","The correct answer is **A: oba saaman‍yayen sitina thaena** (the place you normally reside).

Here's why:

The passage (P) describes a situation where someone is a citizen of one country, serves another, and needs to file income taxes. It clarifies that the income tax obligation is based on *where you normally live* (""oba sitina rate""), regardless of citizenship or where the income is earned.  The passage emphasizes that income is taxed based on residency, even if income sources are spread across multiple countries or a federal system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: eksath janapadaye** (the United States) - While the passage mentions a federal system like the US, it doesn’t automatically mean the income is filed there.  It’s about residency.
* **C: oba daenata waeda karana rate** (the country where you work) - The passage specifically states serving a country doesn't determine tax filing, residency does.
* **D: aduma gaasthuk aethi thaena** (a place you visit occasionally) -  Occasional visits don't establish tax residency.



Therefore, the question (Q) asks *where* you file taxes if you serve a foreign country, and the passage clearly indicates it's based on your normal place of residence."
loka pradarshanaya niwaeradiwa visthara nokaranne pahatha sandahan prakaashawalin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: udbhida vid‍yathmaka pradarshana kalaathmaka ha adhyaapanika pradarshana samaga pradarshanaya kere** (Exhibition includes botanical, educational, artistic and teaching exhibitions).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...Jaatyantara udyaana vidyaatmaka pradarsana yanu mal sandarsana, udbhida udyaana saha shaakavalin sambandha wenath onaema deyak pradarshanaya karana visheshitha avasthaa we.""  This directly translates to ""There is a special arrangement to hold exhibitions including botanical gardens, educational exhibitions, and displays related to plants and agriculture.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage mentions history and culture, it's *part* of the overall exhibition, not the central focus highlighted in the detailed description.
* **C:** The passage mentions the duration (18 months) and area (50 hectares), but this isn’t what the question is asking about - it's about what the exhibition *displays*.
* **D:** The passage explicitly states participation is open to countries (""Eyata sahabhaagi wana ratawal visin...""), so it's a requirement, not optional.

loka pradarshanaye ho jathyanthara pradarshanaye neethireethi wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: rataka ithihasaya saha loka prashna yana dekama pradarshanaya kala yuthuya** (It showcases the history and global issues of the countries).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...Eyata sahabhaagi wana ratawal visin goliya gaetalu ho ovunge ratehi sanskruthiya saha ithihasaya genahaera paema sandaha kalaatmaka ha adyaapanika pradarsana idiripath karayi."" This translates to ""It holds artistic and educational exhibitions displaying the cultures and histories of the participating countries.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage mentions annual exhibitions but doesn't state that a single country receives special attention.
* **C:** While the passage mentions a timeframe (18 months), it doesn't define it as a period when special attention is given.
* **D:** The passage describes participation *from* many countries, not a limited exhibition *for* them.



"
sathwa prahaara aethiweeme sambhaavithawa adu kala haekke pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: wurkayangen yara 25 ka durak pawathwa gaeneema** (limiting the distance of workers to 25 yards).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Udyaana adhikaariyata anuva, valasungen saha vurkayingen avama washayen yaara/meetara 100 k aethin saha anekuth wanajeeweengen meetar 25 kda aethin sitinna.""  This translates to: ""According to the park officials, workers and visitors should stay within 100 yards/meters and various wildlife within 25 meters.""

The question asks about preventing animal attacks. Limiting the distance workers can approach wildlife is a direct measure to reduce the chance of encounters and therefore attacks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aeromaetik awshadha paelaeti raegena yama** (using aromatic medicine pellet type) -  The passage doesn't mention anything about aromatic medicine.
* **B: kandawuru bhoomiyakin kunu akriya kireema** (doing some activity on the land where thorns are) - This isn't mentioned and wouldn't directly prevent attacks.
* **D: ithiri kaema sathunta deemen waelakeema** (giving limited food to animals) - While limiting food can reduce attraction, it doesn't *prevent* an attack if an encounter occurs.  The passage implies that even with limited food, animals are still attracted by scent.



"
wanajiweenge prahaarayanta hethu viya haeki bawa lipiye sandahan nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: wanajiweenta aahara laba deema** (to obtain food for wildlife).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the park officials allow certain areas to grow wild ""to provide food for the animals and to avoid disturbing their lives."" The entire paragraph discusses creating a suitable environment for wildlife, and a key part of that is ensuring they have a food source.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: thada gandhaya (because of the smell):** While smell is mentioned as *attracting* animals, it's not the *reason* for the wild areas. The smell is a result of the food source.
*   **B: durasthabhawaya pawathwa gaeneemata asamath weema (inability to move a limited distance):** The passage mentions limited movement for some animals, but this isn’t the main reason for the wild areas.
*   **D: minisunta nuhuru sathun (a beautiful place for humans):**  While the park is pleasant for humans, the primary focus of these areas is on wildlife, not human enjoyment.
