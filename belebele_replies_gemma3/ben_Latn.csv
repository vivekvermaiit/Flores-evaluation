Khargosh kon dhoroner shikarir jonyo sadharon shikar?,"The correct answer is **C: Majhari akarer biaal**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Taader adhine aro majhari akarer biaal achhe jeguli khargosh thekey shuru korey krishnasarmriga oo horin porjonto majhari akarer shikar khaa."" This directly translates to ""Under them are also medium-sized predators that hunt from rabbits to blackbuck and deer - medium-sized prey.""

Therefore, medium-sized predators (majhari akarer biaal) commonly hunt rabbits (khargosh).
"
Tulonamulok chhoto biaalra sadharonoto nicher konti shikar kore?,"The correct answer is **A: Indoor**.

Here's why:

The passage states that smaller weasels (""hariwe jaoa posha biaal"") hunt very small prey *like* insects, indoor animals (likely referring to house pets or pests), crickets, and birds.  The other options (rabbit, blackbuck, deer) are prey of *larger* weasels, as stated in the first sentence.
"
Nicher konti oceloto’er shikar poddhotir ongsho noy?,"The correct answer is **C: Tader shikarke rathe anusaran kora (Following prey at night)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ocelots have *prakhar drishti* (strong vision) at night and move stealthily. It doesn't say they *follow* prey at night. It says they *see well* in the dark and *ambush* their prey.

Let's look at why the other options *are* part of their hunting method:

*   **A: Tader charpasher poribesher saathe mishe thaka (Blending with their surroundings)** - The passage specifically mentions camouflage: ""ausilotshaw tar poribesher saathe mishe giye ebong shikarer upor jhanpiye pore shikar korey"" (they blend with their environment and pounce on prey).
*   **B: Tader shikarer gondho anusaran kora (Following the scent of their prey)** - The passage states ocelots track prey using scent: ""Bigyanira money koren je oselotguli anusaran cor ebong gondho dwara khaoa (shikar) korey"".
*   **D: Kebol chhoto akarer prani shikar kora (Only hunting small animals)** - The passage says ""oselot je sob pranider shikar korey taader pray sobioceloter cheye onek chhoto"" (the animals ocelots hunt are much smaller than ocelots themselves).



"
Nicher konti ekti oceloto ke sothikbhabe bornona kore na? ,"The correct answer is **C: Tader ghranshokti durbol** (Their sense of smell is weak).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Bigyanira money koren je oselotguli anusaran cor ebong gondho dwara khaoa (shikar) korey, jekhane taaraa matite cholar somoy ghran niye pranider khunje."" This translates to ""Science shows that ocelots track and hunt by scent, where they use their sense of smell to find animals while walking on the ground.""

Therefore, ocelots have a *strong* sense of smell, not a weak one.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Tara rathe bhalo shikar korte pare** (They can hunt well at night) - The passage says ""Rather ondhokare prakhar drishti die taaraa bhaloi dekhte paya"" (At night, they have strong eyesight and can see well).
*   **B: Tara nisshobde cholachol kore** (They move silently) - The passage states ""chupisare cholaferao korey"" (they move silently).
*   **D: Tara chhoto prani shikar korte pochhondo kore** (They prefer to hunt small animals) - The first sentence says ""Ocelotora chhoto chhoto prani khete pochondo korey"" (Ocelots like to eat small animals).



"
Nicher konti ekti bagher borho shokti hisebe bibechito hobe na?,"The correct answer is **A: Gorjon kora (Roaring)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that roaring is *different* for tigers than for lions. It describes a tiger's roar as a ""gargling"" sound, unlike a lion's full-throated roar. While roaring is a characteristic of the *panthera* genus (tigers, lions, jaguars, leopards), the passage highlights it's not a display of strength *for tigers* in the same way it might be for lions.

The other options are all listed as displays of physical power:

*   **Arohon (Climbing):** The passage explicitly states tigers can climb well.
*   **Luffie luffie chola (Leaping/Jumping):** The passage says they can leap incredibly far.
*   **Tana (Stretching/Extending):** The passage mentions they can stretch with five times the strength of a human.

Therefore, roaring is the one activity that isn't presented as a demonstration of a tiger’s strength."
"Onucchhed onujaayi, bagh o shingher modhye parthokyo konti?","The correct answer is **B: Gorjoner shobdo (The sound of their roar)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the difference in their roars:

* **Bagh (Tiger):** ""Baghtir gorjon ekti singher purna-kanthaswarer gorjoner moto naya, borong gargar koraa oo chenchano shobder toiri ekti bakyer moto."" (A tiger's roar is not like a lion's full-throated roar, but rather a guttural, gargling sound made like a bark.)
* **Singh (Lion):** ""...ektie singher purna-kanthaswarer gorjon..."" (a lion's full-throated roar...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Saantaar katar khomota (Swimming ability):** The passage states both can swim.
* **C: Tader luffanor durotwo (The distance they can jump):** The passage says tigers can jump very far, but doesn't compare it to lions.
* **D: Tader tanar shokti (Their strength):** The passage says tigers are 5 times stronger than a strong human, but doesn't explicitly compare their strength *to lions*.
"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Onyanyo jibobigganir age Robbert Hooke ki korechhilen?","The correct answer is **A: Mrito kosh porikkha kora** (Examining dead cells).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Tini chhilen prothom bekti jini **mrito koshguli porjobekkhon korechilen**"" (He was the first person to observe **dead cells**). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kono jibonto pranike dekhte anubikkhan jontrer byabohar kora** (Using a microscope to see any living organism) - While he *used* a microscope, the passage focuses on his observation of *dead* cells, not living organisms generally.
* **C: Chhoto chhoto borgokhetro porjobekkhon kora** (Observing small square areas) - This describes *what* he saw, but not *what he did* originally. He observed these areas *while* examining the dead cells.
* **D: Kono jeeber khudrotomo kathamogoto ekok abishkar kora** (Discovering the fundamental building block of living things) - He didn't discover the cell as the fundamental unit of life, he simply observed and named them. That discovery came later.



"
“Kosh” shobdotir utpottigoto ortho ki?,"The correct answer is **B: Chhoto chhoto ghar**.

The passage states: ""Latin shobdo cella thekey sell shobdoti eseche, jaar maane chhoto ghar."" (The word ""cell"" comes from the Latin word ""cella"" which means small house.)

Therefore, the origin of the word ""kosh"" (cell) means ""chhoto ghar"" (small house)."
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Odhikangsho pranir konti korar khomota royechhe?","The correct answer is **B: Cholafera** (Moving around/Locomotion).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""beshirbhag prani cholafera korte paare"" which translates to ""most animals can move around."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ura** (Flying) - The passage mentions some animals *do* fly, but doesn't say *most* do.
*   **C: Saantaar kata** (Swimming) -  The passage says some swim in the ocean, but not that most animals swim.
*   **D: Khonra** (Eating) - The passage mentions animals eat different things, but doesn't focus on the *ability* to eat as a defining characteristic of *most* animals.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Kichhu pranir konti thake na?","The correct answer is **C: Mostishko**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kebolmatro pranider mostishko thaake (jodio samasta pranider thaake naa; udahoronsorup jelifisher mostishko nei).""  This translates to ""Only animals have brains (though not all animals have them; for example, jellyfish do not have brains)."" 

Therefore, some animals *do not* have brains.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kosh (Cells):** The passage starts by saying life is made of cells (""Asankhya kosh die jeeber srishti""), so all living things have cells.
*   **B: Hojaam korar kkhomota (Ability to digest):** The passage states animals ""digest different things,"" implying all animals have this ability.
*   **D: Khawar kkhomota (Ability to eat):** Similar to digestion, the passage says animals ""eat different things,"" suggesting all animals eat.



"
Konti udbhidke saloksangshleshe sahajyo kore?,"The correct answer is **D: Surjo (Sun)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Udbhid surjaloker sahajye saloksangshlesh prokriyar madhyome taader khaddo toiri korey.""  This translates to: ""Plants make their food through the process of photosynthesis with the help of sunlight.""

Therefore, sunlight is what assists plants in photosynthesis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chhaao (Shadow):** Shadows are the *absence* of light, not something that helps photosynthesis.
*   **B: Prani (Animals):** Animals benefit *from* plants, but don't help them with photosynthesis.
*   **C: Khabar (Food):** Plants *create* food through photosynthesis; food doesn't help the process."
Manooser tyag kora kon jinishti udbhid grohon kore?,"The correct answer is **D: Carbon-dye-oxide**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gachpala oxygen toiri korey jaa manoos proshasher saathe grahan korey ebong taaraa carbon-dye-oxide grahan korey jaa manoos nisshasher saathe chhaer...""  This translates to: ""Plants produce oxygen which humans take in with their breath, and they take in carbon dioxide which humans release with their breath...""

Therefore, plants absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, nicher kon udahoronti bibortaner prokriyake badha day?","The correct answer is **B: Kono janagosthir ekti ongsho jara ekti notun poribeshe sthanantorito hoyechhe** (A portion of a population that has migrated to a new environment).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly describes speciation beginning when a *small group* becomes *separated* from the main population and finds itself in a *different environment* (like moving over mountains, across rivers, or to a new island). This separation and new environment are the initial triggers for the evolutionary process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kono notun sthane theke byartho howa chhoto janagosthi** (A small group that has become lost from a new place) - While a small group getting lost *could* lead to separation, the passage emphasizes the *environmental difference* as the key factor, not just being lost.
*   **C: Kono notun poribesher modhye obhijojoner samonway korte thaka janagosthi** (A population adapting to a new environment) - Adaptation is a *result* of speciation, not the initial *cause* that starts the process.
*   **D: Dhire dhire duiti songkhay bhag hochchhe emon ekti janagosthi** (A population that is slowly dividing into two groups) - This describes a consequence of speciation, the *result* of diverging over time, not the initial separation that begins it.



"
Nicher kon bakyoti projatyayon (speshiyeshana) prokriyake nirbhulbhabe bornona kore na? ,"The correct answer is **A: Kono notun jonosongkhya abhijojon korte byartho hole eti ghote (It happens when a new population fails to adapt)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage clearly states that adaptation is *necessary* for speciation.** The small group *needs* different traits/adaptations to survive in the new environment.  Failure to adapt wouldn't *cause* speciation; it would likely lead to the extinction of the isolated population.

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct, based on the passage:

* **B: Eti bibortan prokriyar ekti oti guruttopurno dik (It is a very important aspect of the evolutionary process):** The passage says ""bibortoner jonno eti ekti guruttopurno ongsho"" (it's an important part of evolution).
* **C: Eti dwara kono notun projatir gathonke bojhay (It explains the formation of new species):** The passage directly defines speciation as ""notun projatir gathonke bojhai"" (explaining the formation of new species).
* **D: Er songghoton anibarjo (Its occurrence is inevitable):** The passage states ""speciation ekti anibarjo porinoti"" (speciation is an inevitable consequence).



"
Songbohontontrer kon ongshoti roktoke hritpinder dike niye jay?,"The correct answer is **A: Dhamani**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Rokto hritpindo thekey chole jaa **dhamani** namak nolir modhyo diye..."" which translates to ""Blood flows from the heart through the **arteries** (dhamani) ..."".  This directly answers the question of what carries blood *to* the heart.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kaishik naee (capillaries):** The passage says capillaries are the smallest blood vessels, but doesn't state they carry blood *to* the heart.
* **C: Ongo (organ):**  While the heart *is* an organ, it doesn't carry the blood itself.
* **D: Sheera (veins):** The passage says veins bring blood *back* to the heart (""...ebong fire ashe **sheera** namak nolir modhyo diye""), not *to* it.



"
Songbohontontrer sobcheye chhoto noli konti?,"The correct answer is **A: Kaishik naee**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""sob thekey khudrotomo nolike bole **kaishik naee**."" This translates to ""the smallest vessel of all is called **capillaries**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dhamani (Arteries)** - The text says arteries carry blood *from* the heart, not that they are the smallest vessels.
*   **C: Sheera (Veins)** - The text says veins carry blood *to* the heart, not that they are the smallest vessels.
*   **D: Ongo (Organ)** - The heart is an organ, not a blood vessel.



"
Kono potonger pakhar saathe shorirer pechoner ongsho khomota nicher konti briddhi kore?,"The correct answer is **B: Lukanor jayga (Hiding places)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Beshirbhag potongeri taader pakhar saathe shorirer pechoner ongsho bhanj korar suvidha royeche. Shikarider thekey lukanor jonno eti taader chhoto jaigagulite bistrito porisor deyo.""  This translates to: ""Most insects have the ability to break off parts of their bodies with their wings. This gives them a wider range in small places to hide from predators.""

Therefore, the ability to break off body parts with wings increases their hiding places.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Khadyo sorboraho (Food supply):** The passage doesn't mention anything about food supply being increased.
*   **C: Sathider khonja (Finding mates):** While the passage mentions finding mates as a benefit of their initial abilities, it doesn't connect this to the wing/body part breaking ability.
*   **D: Lorhaier goti (Fighting speed):** The passage doesn't mention fighting or speed.



"
Nicher kontike Onucchhede pokar ory khomota dwara akranto hoyechhe emon kichhu hisebe ullekh kora hoyni?,"The correct answer is **A: Projonon (Reproduction)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses the primary abilities of early spiders:

*   **Easier hunting and finding mates:** Their unique strength helped them hunt more easily and find partners.
*   **Breaking body parts with their fangs:**  Most spiders can detach parts of their bodies.
*   **Hiding from predators:** This ability aids in survival.
*   **Food gathering:** It helps them with food collection.

The passage **does not mention anything about reproduction** or how their unique abilities impacted their ability to reproduce.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jibonkal (Lifespan):** The abilities described would impact survival and therefore lifespan.
*   **C: Khadyo songgroho (Food Gathering):** The passage directly states the abilities help with finding and obtaining food.
*   **D: Karjodokkhota (Work Efficiency/Capability):** The ability to hunt easier and detach body parts *are* capabilities/efficiencies."
Nicher kon boishishtyoti sadharonoto dinosaur er sathe somporkito noy?,"The correct answer is **B: Palok (Eyelids)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes creatures that resemble dinosaurs but are actually birds.** It specifically mentions they have wings and fly.
* The passage mentions features like strong claws (""thabajukto paa""), scaled legs (""deem paada""), and even postures reminiscent of the T-Rex (""tea-rexer moti pichoner due'poey bhar diye haante""). 
* **Eyelids (Palok) are not mentioned as a characteristic of these creatures or dinosaurs in general within the text.** While dinosaurs *likely* had eyelids, the passage focuses on more prominent, noticeable features.

Therefore, eyelids are the least associated trait with dinosaurs based on the information provided.
"
Nicher konti sadharonoto pakhi o dinosaurer modhyekar eki boishishtyo hisebe bibechito hoy na?,"The correct answer is **C: Orhar kkhomota (Ability to fly)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that dinosaurs evolved into birds. It highlights several shared characteristics:

*   **Deem paada (webbed feet):** Mentioned as a shared trait.
*   **Haantar jonyo pichoner due'poey byabohar kora (using rear limbs for hunting):**  Specifically mentions a T-Rex-like posture.
*   **Thabajukto paa (clawed feet):** Also mentioned as a shared characteristic.

However, the passage *doesn't* mention flight as a characteristic of dinosaurs. While some dinosaurs may have had feathers, the ability to fly is what fundamentally distinguishes modern birds from their dinosaur ancestors. Therefore, flight is not a shared, basic characteristic in this context.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, cycad udbhider kon ongshoti Triceratops khete pochhondo kore?","The correct answer is **A: Teekkhno pata** (Sharp leaves).

The passage states: ""Ekti triceratops tar shokto thhont diye gacher sockle **patta** chhinne niye guigta khete paroto."" which translates to ""A triceratops could tear off the leaves with its powerful beak and chew them to eat.""  It also describes the leaves as ""teekkhno, chokchoke patar mukut"" (sharp, prickly crown of leaves).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gunri (Pulp):** The passage doesn't mention triceratops eating the pulp of the cycad.
* **C: Shikad (Spikes):** While the passage mentions spikes, it says the triceratops used its beak to *cut* the leaves, not eat the spikes.
* **D: fall (Fruit):** The passage only briefly mentions that some modern animals eat toxic fruits, but doesn't say anything about cycads producing fruit or triceratops eating them.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Triceratops nicher konti khete shobcheye pochhondo korbe? ","The correct answer is **B: Shokto shakhajukto udbhid** (Strongly branched vegetation).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Triceratops ""daant kebolmatro patta naya khub shokto shakha-proshakhajukto ebong shikadkeo churno korte sokkhom"" - meaning their teeth were suited for tearing off and chewing strongly branched leaves. It then describes how they would eat cycad plants, which are described as having a crown of tough, prickly leaves and looking like a small palm tree.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sloth:** The passage mentions sloths *as an example* of a modern animal that can eat toxic leaves, but doesn't suggest Triceratops would prefer to eat them.
*   **C: Tiyapakhi (Parrot):** Parrots are mentioned alongside sloths as animals that can eat toxic plants, but again, it doesn't imply Triceratops would prioritize them.
*   **D: Bishakto fallljukto udbhid (Toxic fruit-bearing plants):** The passage suggests that while some scientists believe the plants Triceratops ate were toxic, it doesn't mean they *preferred* to eat toxic fruits. It focuses on their preference for the leaves.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Nicher kon khelati Italir sobcheye uttorer onchole byapok jonopriyo chhilo bole mone kora hoy?","The correct answer is **A: Football**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Janapriya khelagulor modhye royeche football, basketball, volleybal..."". It then says that due to Italy's participation in the Olympics and international competitions, winter sports are *most popular in northern regions*. However, it *first* lists football among the popular sports overall.  The question asks about the *most* popular in the north, and while winter sports gained popularity there, the passage doesn't state they overtook football. It only says they became *more* popular.

Therefore, football remains the most likely answer based on the information provided.



"
"Onucchhede prodotto tothyer bhittite, nicher kon khelay Itali bishwakup joy korechhilo?","The correct answer is **A: Football**.

The passage explicitly states: ""eti 2006 saale fifa vishwakap champion hoyechilo"" which translates to ""it was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006"".  ""Eti"" refers to the Italian national football team.



"
Kon ghotonar pore luxemberger nirdishto ongshoguli Belgian hoye jay?,"The correct answer is **B: Belgian biplob**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bortoman somoyer belgium er ongshoguli chhilo atiter luxemberger ongsho kintu tobe 1830 shotoke belgian biplober pore belgiane porinoto hoyechilo.""  This translates to: ""The parts of present-day Belgium were formerly parts of Luxembourg, but after the Belgian Revolution of 1830, they became Belgian.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Prothom Bishwojuddho (World War I):** The text mentions Germany occupying Luxembourg during both World Wars, not Belgium gaining territory.
*   **C: Ditiyo bishwojuddho (World War II):** Same as above.
*   **D: Europea union protishtha (Establishment of the European Union):**  The EU's formation is a later event and doesn't explain how Luxembourg lost territory to Belgium.



"
Nicher konti luxemberger niropekkhotay probhab phelechhilo?,"The correct answer is **A: German der kormokando** (German occupation).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Luxemberg sob somoii ekti niropokkhe desh hisebe thakte cheche kintu prothom ebong Ditiyo bishwojuddher dutitei germany eke dokhol korey nipechilo."" (Luxembourg always wanted to be an independent country, but was occupied by Germany in both the First and Second World Wars.) This directly indicates that German occupation negatively impacted Luxembourg's independence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Europea unione jogdan (European Union contribution):** The passage states Luxembourg *joined* the organization that became the European Union, which is a positive development, not something that hindered independence.
* **C: Belgian biplob (Belgian revolution):** The passage mentions the Belgian revolution led to Belgium becoming independent, and Luxembourg was *part* of Belgium before that. While related to its history, it wasn't a direct threat to Luxembourg's independence itself.
* **D: Ekti swadhin desh howa (Becoming an independent country):** This is the goal Luxembourg pursued, not something that affected its independence negatively.

The question asks how many square kilometers of Turkey lie in Europe.  The text directly states this is 23,764 square kilometers.



"

The text states: ""Turosker ei anchalti pray ayatkhetrer moto akritir ekti 1600 kilometres (1000 mail) deergho..."" which translates to ""Turkey has a shape like a regional bay with an area of 1600 kilometers (1000 miles) long..."".

Therefore, the length of Turkey is 1000 miles."

Here's why:

The text states: ""...latin prayashai dharmiya anusthangulite byabohrito hoy"" which translates to ""...Latin is used in religious ceremonies."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Protidiner jogajoge** (Daily communication) - The text says Italian is used for daily communication.
* **C: Aini kaajkorme** (Legal work) - The text says Italian is used for legal work.
* **D: Doptorik jogajoge** (Official communication) - The text says Italian is used for official communication.



"
"Vatican City-te, Italian bhasha kisher jonyo byabohrito hoy?","The correct answer is **D: Protidiner jogajoge** (For daily communication).

The text states: ""Vatican city tar aini kaajkormo ebong sarkari jogajog byabastha italian byabohar korey. jara rajye kaaj koren taader kachhe italy protidiner byaboharik bhasha..."" which translates to ""Vatican City uses Italian for its legal work and governmental communication. For those who work in the state, Italian is the everyday language..."".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aini kaajkorme (Legal work):** While Italian *is* used for legal work, the text specifies it's also used for everyday communication.
*   **B: Doptorik jogajoge (Diplomatic communication):** The text doesn't mention Italian being used for diplomatic communication specifically.
*   **C: Dharmiya anushthane (Religious ceremonies):** The text states Latin is used for religious ceremonies.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, otyadhunik computer e shobdo mishron theke nicher kon subidhati pawa jay?","The correct answer is **A: Sangeet (Music)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sangeet eksathe prokriya ebong mishran korte jonno prayi spophistic computer byabohar korey record koraa hoy.""  This translates to: ""Sophisticated computers are frequently used to record, process, and mix music.""

Therefore, the passage directly indicates that modern computers offer the benefit of mixing sounds, specifically in the context of music.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Animation:** While the passage mentions animation being *created* on computers, it doesn't say computers provide a *benefit* in the *mixing of sounds* related to animation.
*   **C: Chhobi (Images/Photos):** The passage mentions computers are used for images and videos, but not specifically for *mixing sounds* related to them.
*   **D: Nirman (Construction):** This isn't mentioned in the passage at all.

"Onucchhed onujaayi, nicher kon sthaaner barite flusher subidha jukto toilet chhilo?","The correct answer is **A: Mahenjo-daro**.

The passage specifically states: ""Harappa oo mahenjo-daro shahargulir pray protiti barite ekti atyadhunik nikashi byabosthar saathe ekti flush koraa toilet sangjukto chhilo."" (Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a modern drainage system in almost every house.)

The other options are mentioned as having toilets, but not *flush* toilets with drainage systems.
"
Nicher kon onchole unnoto nikashi byabostha pawa giyechhilo?,"The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

The passage specifically states: ""Harappa oo mahenjo-daro shahargulir pray protiti barite ekti atyadhunik nikashi byabosthar saathe ekti flush koraa toilet sangjukto chhilo."" (Harappa and Mohenjo-daro cities had a flush toilet connected to a modern drainage system in almost every house.)

While the passage mentions drainage systems and toilets in other places, it highlights Harappa as having the *most* advanced system - a flush toilet in almost every house. Therefore, Harappa is the most accurate answer."
Nicher kontir karone skater ghure jay?,"The correct answer is **A: Skater nicher foloke kichhuta bankano ongsho** (The slightly curved part of the skater's blade).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Jehetu folokti kono naa kono dike kaat hoye jaa, taai foloker neecher ongshoti kichuta bankano howar borofer sangosparshe thaka prantotio benke jaa. er foley skaterti ghure jaa."" 

This translates to: ""Because the blade is angled in one direction or another, the slightly curved part of the blade in contact with the ice causes the skater to turn. This is how the skater turns.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Skater foloker duiti pranto** (The skater's two blades) - While the blades are important, it's the *shape* and angle of the blade, not just having two of them, that causes turning.
*   **C: Skater er samogrik dokkhotar stor** (The skater's overall level of skill) - Skill is necessary to *use* the blade's turning ability, but it's not the *cause* of the turning itself.
*   **D: Borofer gunoman** (The quality of the ice) - Ice quality affects glide and grip, but doesn't directly cause the skater to turn.

* **The passage states:** ""Jehetu folokti kono naa kono dike kaat hoye jaa, taai foloker neecher ongshoti kichuta **bankano** howar borofer sangosparshe thaka prantotio benke jaa."" This translates to: ""Because the blade wears down in one direction or another, the lower part of the blade becomes slightly **banked** due to contact with the ice, causing the skate to turn.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Duiti pranto (Two provinces/sides):** The passage explicitly mentions the two sides/prongs (of the skate blade).
* **C: Abotal (Rounded):** The passage refers to a rounded function (abotal funk) within the blade's design.
* **D: Kaat (Worn down/cut):** The passage talks about the blade wearing down (""kaat hoye geleo"").

Therefore, **Bankano (banked)** is the term used to describe *how* the blade changes shape due to wear, making it the correct answer to describe the blade's function.

"Onucchhed onujaayi, kon prokriyati paramanuke alok theke otirikto shakti mukto korar sujog day?","The correct answer is **D: Radiationer uddipito nisswaron (Stimulated emission of radiation)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""bigyanira ei prokriyatike """"""""uddipito radiation nisshoron"""""""" hisabe akhya dikechen"" which translates to ""scientists have named this process """"""""stimulated emission of radiation"""""""""".  The passage goes on to explain *how* this happens (through photon emission), but the *process* itself is stimulated emission of radiation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Radiation:** While radiation is involved, it doesn't describe the *specific process* of releasing excess energy.
*   **B: Photoner uddipito nisswaron (Photons stimulated emission):** This is a partial description, but ""stimulated *emission of radiation*"" is the complete and scientifically accurate term.
*   **C: Photon:** A photon is a particle of light, the *result* of the process, not the process itself.



"
Paramanu kiser karone photon nirgomon kore?,"The correct answer is **B: Ujjal aloo dwara uddipito hoye (Being excited by bright light)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""paramanuguli ujjal aloo dwara uddipito hoy jaa aloker photon konar nirgomon ghotay"" - which translates to ""atoms are excited by bright light, which causes the emission of photons.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Otirikto shokti nisshoron (Excess energy emission)** - While true that energy *is* released, the text specifies *how* the energy is released - through photons after being excited by light. It's a result, not the cause.
*   **C: Osthitishil shoktir stor (Stable energy store)** - The text doesn't mention anything about stable energy stores. It's about energy *being added* through light.
*   **D: Radiationer birup protikriya (Reverse reaction of radiation)** - The text describes *stimulated emission* of radiation, not a reverse reaction.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, nicher konti dhire dhire light bulber kaj kora bondho kore debe?","The correct answer is **C: Bulber vetorer filament khoy hoye gele** (If the bulb's internal filament is broken/lost).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ghantar pore ghanta kaaj korar pore balber filamenti abosheshe khhoi hoye jaa ebong light balbti aar kaaj korey naa."" (After working for hours, the bulb's filament is completely lost and the light bulb stops working.)

This directly indicates that the filament breaking is the reason the bulb stops functioning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lighter fixture sothikbhabe bondho kora na hole** (If the fixture is not properly closed) - The passage doesn't mention this as a cause for the bulb stopping. It focuses on safety precautions *when replacing* a bulb.
*   **B: Bulber dhatob ongshoti sokete angshikbhabe thakle** (If the bulb's metal part is partially in the socket) - This is a *safety hazard* described in the passage, not the reason the bulb initially fails.
*   **D: Soketer modhye bidyuter probaho dheer hoye gele** (If the flow of electricity in the socket slows down) - The passage does not state this is the cause of the bulb failing.



"
Light bulb protisthaponer somoy nicher konti sporsho korle bipoder sombhabona thake?,"The correct answer is **C: Bulber vitti ba kathamo (Bulb casing or stem)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the danger lies in touching the metal parts of the bulb while it's still connected to the socket. This includes the casing or stem of the bulb (""balber dhatob ongshoti""). Touching these parts when the circuit is live can result in a severe electric shock.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Filament:** While the filament burns out *causing* the bulb to fail, you wouldn't directly touch it during replacement.
*   **B: Lighter switch:** The passage recommends turning off the switch *before* replacement to avoid shock, so the switch itself isn't the direct danger.
*   **D: Cable:** The cable is part of the circuit, but the passage focuses on the direct danger of the bulb's metal parts while in the socket.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, kono nucleus bhenge gele ki ghote?","The correct answer is **B: Shokti nirgoto hoy (Energy is released)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that when a nucleus breaks apart (like in a fusion bomb), ""nucleusgulo bivokto korche abar erpore seii shakti kichhu nirgoto korche"" - meaning the nuclei are broken apart and then *energy is released*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Proton pawa jay (Protons are found):** While breaking a nucleus *can* release protons, the passage doesn't specifically state this as the primary outcome.
*   **C: Poromanu osthitisheel hoye jay (The atom becomes stable):** The passage says some nuclei are *already* unstable, and breaking them releases energy, suggesting instability is a precursor, not a result.
*   **D: Neutron hariye jay (Neutrons are lost):** Similar to protons, neutrons *can* be released, but it's not the central point of the passage.



"
Nicher konti lomba durotwer call ke prithibite protipholito kore pherot pathay,"The correct answer is **B: Satellite**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Apni jokhon koyek hajar mail dure thaka kono bektike call koren tokhon apni ekti satellite byabohar korchen."" (When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Telescope** - Telescopes are for *seeing* things in space, not for transmitting phone calls.
*   **C: Alo (Light)** - Light is involved in the transmission of signals, but it's not the *device* that reflects the call.
*   **D: Rocket** - Rockets *launch* satellites and telescopes into space, but they don't reflect calls.



"
Nicher konti mohashunye telescope rakhte byabohrito hoy?,"The correct answer is **B: Rocket**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Satellite ekti rocket madhyome mohakashe preron koraa hoyechilo."" (Satellite is launched into space by a rocket.) and ""Mohakashe satellite baa telescope sthapon korar jonno 100 foot unchu ekti daityakar rocket laage."" (A giant rocket of 100 feet or more is needed to establish a satellite or telescope in space.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Light beam:** Light beams are used *by* telescopes, not to launch them.
*   **C: Bayumondol:** The passage states telescopes are used *because of* the atmosphere, not to hold them.
*   **D: 100 footer beshi uchchatar satellite:** While satellites are high up, the rocket *takes* them there, it doesn't *contain* the telescope itself.



"
Somoyer otibahito howa track korar jonyo ekti chakrakar ghotonar byapare konti lokkhyo rakhte hobe?,"The correct answer is **B: Punorabritti (Repetition)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that observing the *repetition* of a cyclical event can lead to a feeling of being overwhelmed by time. It describes a ""chakrakar ghotona"" (cyclical event) as something that happens ""niyomitovabe baar baar ghote"" - ""regularly happens again and again."" This repetition is the key element that triggers the experience of time's passing and its overwhelming nature.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Somoykal (Duration/Time Period):** While duration is related to time, the passage focuses on the *experience* of time through cyclical events, not simply the length of time.
*   **C: Probhab (Influence/Effect):** The passage mentions time *influences* everything, but the cyclical event specifically relates to *repetition*, not effect.
*   **D: Kothinota (Difficulty):** The passage says understanding time is difficult, but this isn't the characteristic used to *track* feeling overwhelmed by time through a cyclical event.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Kono ghotonar kon dikti tulona korar jonyo somoy byabohrito hoy?","The correct answer is **A: Doirgho (Duration)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Somoy aro holo kibhabe amra ghotonasomuher **karjokal (doirgho)** tulonay kori.""  This translates to ""Time is also how we compare the **duration** of events.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Punorabritti (Repetition):** While the passage *mentions* cyclical events and repetition as an example of experiencing time, it doesn't say time *is used to compare* repetition itself.
* **C: Obhiggota (Intensity/Focus):** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Probhab (Influence/Effect):** The passage states time *influences* things, but doesn't say we use time to *compare* influence.

"Onucchhed onujaayi, Singhasaner uttoradhikarir jonyo nicher konti adorsho hisebe bibechito hoy?","The correct answer is **D: Senabahinite jawar age bishwobidyarol porha** (Studying at university before joining the military).

Here's why:

The passage states that Charles went to university *and then* joined the military. It highlights this as something unusual for a member of the royal family – that he completed a degree *before* fulfilling his military duties. This implies that education before military service is seen as a suitable quality for an heir to the throne.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 2:2 degree orjon (Achieving a 2:2 degree):** While the passage mentions Charles received a 2:2, it doesn't present it as an *ideal* quality. It's just a fact about his education.
*   **B: Senabahinite jog dewar jonyo bishwobidyarol tyag kora (Giving up university to join the military):** The passage actually describes the opposite – Charles *didn't* give up university for the military.
*   **C: Itihash porha (Studying history):** The passage mentions he studied history, but doesn't suggest that studying history is specifically important for an heir.



"
"Onucchhede prodotto tothyo onujaayi, Charles sorboprothom hisebe konti koren?","The correct answer is **C: Ekti degree orjon koren** (He earns a degree).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Charles chhilen british raja poribarer prothom sadasya jaake ekta degree deoa hoyechilo"" which translates to ""Charles was the first member of the British royal family to be awarded a degree.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: School shesh korar age senabahinite jog den** (Join the army before finishing school) - The text mentions he joined the navy *after* finishing school.
*   **B: Protnototte porhashona koren** (Studies archaeology) - He studied archaeology *among* other subjects, but it doesn't say he did it first.
*   **D: Trinity College-e jan** (Born at Trinity College) - He *attended* Trinity College, he wasn't born there.



"
Trigovason’er nowbohor kon desher chhilo?,"The correct answer is **D: Norway**.

The passage states: ""নরওয়েবাসী ওলাফ ত্রিgovসন (Narwewasi Olaf Trigovason)"" led the Viking fleet. This directly translates to ""Norwegian Olaf Trigovason"". Therefore, the fleet was from Norway."
Itihaser kon somoye germany estoniar upore shoktishali sangoskritik probhab proyog korechhilo?,"The text states the influence was ""ponero shatabdir ashepashe"" which translates to ""around the 15th century"".  The 15th century was roughly 500-600 years ago (from 2024). Therefore, the closest answer is:

**C: Pray 600 bochhor age** 

While ""around"" leaves room for interpretation, 600 years ago is the most accurate estimate based on the provided text."
Estonian Bhasha konti dwara probhabito hoyechhilo?,"The correct answer is **B: German bornomala**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""eti german bornomalar oppor vitti korey toiri ebong ekti akkhar """"""""o/o"""""""" jog koraa hoyeche."" (It was created by sufficiently modifying the German alphabet and adding a letter ""o/o""). It also mentions German influence in general.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: o/o akkhor:** This is a *result* of the influence, not the source of it.
*   **C: German sanyasi:** While the passage mentions German monks wanting to deeply educate locals, they didn't *directly* influence the language structure – they used the German alphabet to *create* the Estonian one.
*   **D: Bhogoban:**  This is irrelevant to the information provided in the passage.

"Onucchhed onujaayi, hindi bhashider songkhya kon bishoyer upore bhitti kore othanama kore?","The correct answer is **A: Jodi Hindir khub kachhakachhi dialic guli gonona kora hoy** (If the very closely related dialects of Hindi are counted).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Khubi nibirvabe somporkito dialicgulir gananar upor nirbhar korey baa naa korey sthani speaker sankhya bivinno hoy."" This translates to: ""The number of native speakers varies depending on whether or not closely related dialects are counted.""

This directly indicates that the estimated number of Hindi speakers is contingent upon *how* the dialects are counted - whether inclusively or exclusively.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jodi Urdu bhashider gonona kora hoy** (If the Urdu language is counted) - The passage mentions the overlap in vocabulary between Hindi and Urdu, but doesn't say the Hindi speaker count depends on counting Urdu speakers.
*   **C: Jodi ei bhasha jara bojhe tader gonona kora hoy** (If those who understand the language are counted) - The passage *provides* the number of people who understand Hindi (800 million), but says the speaker count (340-500 million) varies due to dialect counting. It doesn't say the speaker count *depends* on the understanding count.
*   **D: Jodi ei bhasha jara porhte pare tader gonona kora hoy** (If those who can read the language are counted) - The passage doesn't mention reading ability at all.



"
Nicher konti Hindi o Urdu bhasha somporke satyo bornona day?,"The correct answer is **A: Ubhoy bhashar boktader modhye sadharonoto songjog nei** (There is usually no communication between speakers of both languages).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hindi aar urdur modhye shobdabolir meal achhe kintu akkhar alada; daeenandin kothabartar khettre dui bhasabhashi boktai porosporke bujhte paare.""  This translates to: ""Hindi and Urdu have a common vocabulary but different scripts; in everyday conversational areas, speakers of both languages can understand each other.""

Therefore, option A is *false* because the passage says they *can* communicate.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

*   **B: Egulir hater lekha alada** (Their scripts are different) - The passage states ""akkhar alada"" (scripts are different).
*   **C: Egulir shobdaboli o hater lekha eki** (Their vocabulary and scripts are the same) - This is partially true as the vocabulary is similar (""shobdabolir meal achhe"") but the scripts are different. However, option B is more direct and accurate concerning script difference.
*   **D: Egulir shobdaboli alada** (Their vocabulary is different) - The passage states they have a common vocabulary *but* different scripts, implying vocabulary isn’t entirely different.

Nicher konti Hangul bornomala somporke satyo tothyo noy?,"The correct answer is **A: Eti badsha sejongyer rajottokaler shurute abishkrito hoy** (It was invented at the beginning of King Sejong's reign).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Hangul was invented *during* King Sejong's reign (1418-1450), specifically in 1444. This is not at the *beginning* of his reign.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: Ei bornomalar mul nam chhilo hunmin jiongnam** (The original name of this alphabet was Hunmin Jeong-eum) - The passage explicitly states this.
* **C: Joson rajbongsher choturtho raja eti abishkar koren** (The fourth king of the Joseon dynasty invented it) - The passage identifies King Sejong as the fourth king of Joseon and the inventor.
* **D: Eti uddeshyomulokbhabe abishkrito hoyechhilo** (It was invented with a practical purpose) - The passage says it was invented for ""daily use"" and its name means ""the correct sounds for the instruction of the people."" This indicates a deliberate, practical purpose.



"
Hunmin jiongnam bornomala dhire dhire kishe poribortito hoyechhe?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangul**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tini muloto hanguel bornomalar namkaran korechilen hunmin jiongnam..."" (He originally named the Hangul alphabet *Hunmin Jeong-eum*...).  This directly links *Hunmin Jeong-eum* to the origin of *Hangul*. The question asks how *Hunmin Jeong-eum* evolved, and the answer is *Hangul* as it's the modern name for the same writing system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sejong:**  Sejong was the *creator* of the alphabet, not its evolution.
* **C: Joson:** Joson is the dynasty during which it was created, not the alphabet itself.
* **D: Jeongeum:** While *Jeongeum* is part of the original name (*Hunmin Jeong-eum*), *Hangul* is the name it's known and evolved into today.

"Onucchhed onujaayi, kon bhashaguli sangaskrita dwara probhabito hoyechhe?","Correct answer is **D: Bharatiya bhashaguli**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sangaskrito ekti khub jotil ebong samriddha bhasha, jaa onek adhunik bharatiya bhasar utso, jemon latin holo farasi ebong spanisher moto europea bhasar utso.""

This directly translates to: ""Sanskrit is a very bright and rich language, which is the source of many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the source of French and Spanish-like European languages.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly states that Sanskrit influenced Indian languages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Latin bhashaguli** - The passage states Sanskrit is *comparable* to Latin, but doesn't say Latin was influenced by Sanskrit.
*   **B: Europea bhashaguli** - While the passage draws a parallel between Sanskrit and Latin as sources of languages, it doesn’t state European languages were directly influenced by Sanskrit.
*   **C: Prachin bhashaguli** - Sanskrit *is* an ancient language, but the question asks which languages were *influenced* by it."
"Onucchhed onujaayi, sangaskritar byabohar kontir karone bileen hoyechhe?","Correct answer is **D: Shrenibibhag** (Social hierarchy/class division).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""uponishodguli sangkalaner pore, jajoktontrer karone sangaskrito pray mlan hoye gelo."" This translates to ""After the compilation of the Upanishads, Sanskrit declined due to social hierarchy/class division.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jotilota (Brilliance/radiance):** The passage describes Sanskrit *as* brilliant, not as a reason for its decline.
*   **B: Arjoder sthanantor (Migration of Aryans):** While the passage mentions the Aryans bringing the language, it doesn't state that migration caused its decline.
*   **C: Latin bhashaguli (Latin languages):** Latin languages are mentioned for comparison, not as a cause for Sanskrit's decline.

Therefore, the passage specifically identifies social hierarchy as the reason for the decline of Sanskrit's usage."

Here's why:

* **The passage states that gravity on Io will make you weigh less.** It specifically says someone weighing 200 pounds on Earth would weigh only 36 pounds on Io. This is because Io has less mass than Earth and therefore weaker gravitational pull.
* **Option C contradicts this information.** It claims Io's gravity would *increase* your weight.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Prithibir mohakorsho ball apnake Io’r mohakorsho baller tulonay kom tanbe** (Earth's gravity pulls you less than Io's gravity) - Incorrect. The passage states the opposite.
* **B: Lo’r mohakorsho beshi tane, jekarone apnar ojon kombe** (Io's gravity pulls more, causing your weight to decrease) - Incorrect.
* **D: Lo’r mohakorsher tulonay prithibir mohakorsho apnake beshi tanbe** (Compared to Io's gravity, Earth's gravity pulls you more) - This aligns with the passage's information; you'd weigh more on Earth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pasher pranter bhuttok puru** (The crust is full on the sides) - The passage mentions the sides are 70km deep, but doesn't say it's ""full"".
* **C: Durer prante kom maria thake** (There are fewer impacts on the far side) - The passage doesn't directly address the *number* of impacts on the far side, only that the crust's thickness affects impact frequency.
* **D: Ucchobhumir niche kom maria thakte pare** (There may be fewer impacts under the highlands) - This is the opposite of what the passage implies - highlands have *thicker* crust and therefore more potential for impacts near the surface.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, chander bhuttok kothay sobcheye puru?","The correct answer is **D: Mariar niche**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bhuttokti pichoner dicky 100 kimmy puru."" This translates to ""The crust is 100 km thick on the far side.""  The ""far side"" is where the maria (dark, basaltic plains) are located. Therefore, the crust is thickest *under* the maria.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pasher prante (Edge/Side):** The passage doesn't specify thickness at the edges.
*   **B: Jekhane chander maria ache sekhane (Where the lunar maria are):** While maria are *on* the far side where it's thickest, the question asks *where* it's thickest, which is *under* the maria.
*   **C: Uchchobhumir niche (Under the highlands):** The passage states it's thinner in highlands (""mariate patla ebong uchchobhumite motaa hoye thaake"")."
"Onucchhed onujaayi, kichhu nirdishto manoos nicher konti bishwas kore?","The correct answer is **C: Onyanyo groheo pran aache** (There is life on other planets).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Oneke biswas korey anno prithibite eleane baa anno kono jib bus korte paare"" which translates to ""Many believe aliens exist or life can exist on other planets.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Manoos onyanyo nokkhotre giyechhe** (Humans have gone to other stars) - The passage talks about *future* possibilities of travel, not past occurrences.
*   **B: Manoos onyanyo bishwa ghure dekhte sokkhom noy** (Humans are not capable of touring other worlds) - The passage implies humans *will* be able to travel, though perhaps not for long periods.
*   **D: Protiti nokkhotrer modhye trilion mile ero kom durotwo royechhe** (Every star is less than a trillion miles apart) - The passage mentions stars being ""koyek hajar kotee mail dure"" (a few thousand crores of miles away) which is a large distance, not necessarily less than a trillion miles.

The passage states: ""Soorjer kendra thekey dure jete thakle gas aro patla hote thaake."" (As you go further from the center of the sun, the gas becomes thinner.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Plasma:** While the sun *is* made of plasma, the passage specifically mentions gas becoming thinner.
*   **B: Agun (Fire):** Fire is a result of the sun's processes, not something that becomes thinner with distance.
*   **D: Bhutwok (Ghost/Spirit):** This is irrelevant to the scientific description of the sun.

The passage explicitly states: ""Amra soorjer dike takale berer je ongshoti dekhte paai take photosphere bole..."" which translates to ""The part of the sun we see when looking at it is called the photosphere...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bhutwok (Ghost):** This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: Plasma:** While the sun *is* made of plasma, the passage doesn't say this is the visible part.
*   **D: Kendra (Center):** The passage mentions the center but states it's where the gas is densest and doesn't specify it's visible.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shukrer porjaiguli soorjer charpashe grohoguli ghorar copernicuser tottoke samarthan korechilo."" This directly translates to ""The phases of Venus supported Copernicus's theory that the planets revolve around the sun."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Shukrer rupantor (Venus's transformation):** While Venus *does* change appearance, the *phases* (porjai) are specifically what provided evidence.
*   **C: Shukrer sathe soorjer sadrishyo (Similarity between Venus and the Sun):** The passage mentions Galileo observing Venus resembling the moon, but it's the phases, not the similarity, that support Copernicus.
*   **D: Chaander sathe soorjer sadrishyo (Similarity between the Moon and the Sun):** This is a detail about Galileo's observations, but doesn't directly relate to supporting Copernicus's theory.



"

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chaander ekti push ja surjer dike mukh kore ache** (The moon has phases that face the sun) - While Galileo observed the moon's phases, the passage *specifically* highlights his observations of Venus's phases.
*   **C: Groher soorrjer charpashe ghora** (Planets orbit the sun) - This is a *result* of Galileo's observations of Venus's phases supporting Copernicus's theory, not the observation itself.
*   **D: Shukrer rupantor** (Venus's transformations) - While Venus *does* appear to change, the passage focuses on the observation of its *phases* which explain those changes.

"
Kon swikrititi Amazon nodeer jonyo projojyo noy?,"The correct answer is **B: Eti sobcheye boro nodee** (It is the biggest river).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Amajon nodee prithibir dwitiya dirghotomo ebong brihottomo nodee."" (Amazon is the second longest and biggest river in the world). This means it's the *second* biggest, not the biggest.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

* **A: Eti dwitiya dirghotomo nodee** (It is the second longest river) - Directly stated in the text.
* **C: Eti dirghotomo nodee** (It is the longest river) - While not the longest overall, the text says it's 8 million more cubic feet of water than the second largest river, implying a significant claim to being ""longest"" in terms of water volume.
* **D: Eti sobcheye proshosto nodee** (It is the broadest river) - The text states ""Amajon prithibir sobche prososto nodee"" (Amazon is the broadest river in the world).

Onucchhede ullekhito kon dhoroner kaje sobcheye kom songkhyok venejueller basinda nijukto hoy?,"The correct answer is **C: Toilo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Venejueller ek onnotomo pradhan shilp holo toilo, jekhane deshti holo neat roptanikarok, jodio toiloshilpote shudhumatra ek shotangsho kaaj korey."" (Venezuela's most prominent craft is oil, where most are employed, *but only one-tenth work in the oil industry*.)

Let's look at the other options:

* **Krishi (Agriculture):** The passage says one-fifth of those in the service sector work in agriculture.
* **Shilp (Industry):** The passage states one-quarter of those in the service sector work in industry.
* **Porisheba (Service sector):** Two-thirds of Venezuelans work in the service sector - this is the largest group.

Since only one-tenth of Venezuelans work in the oil industry (toilo), it's the sector with the fewest employed Venezuelans.
"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, nicher kon khetre sobcheye beshi songkhyok Venejueller basinda hoy?","The correct answer is **A: Porisheba (Service)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Venejueller dui tritiiangsho jara porisheba khaate kaaj korey"" which translates to ""Two-thirds of Venezuelan residents work in the service sector."" This is a larger proportion than those working in industry (one-fourth) or agriculture (one-fifth). While oil is a major industry, the passage only states that one-tenth *of those in industry* work in oil, not that it's the largest sector overall.

Therefore, the service sector employs the highest number of Venezuelan residents.
"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, fusion tarader ki korar sujog day?","The correct answer is **A: Aro bhari upadan toiri** (Producing heavier elements).

Here's why:

The passage states that hydrogen atoms, due to the energy released during their formation, *escape and are emitted as heat*. Scientists are working on a ""furnace"" (reactor) to *create energy in a similar way*. This implies that fusion, the process happening in stars, allows for the creation of *heavier* elements from lighter ones (like hydrogen).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fusion reactor toiri** - The passage says scientists are *working on* building fusion reactors, it doesn't say fusion *allows* them to be built.
* **C: aloo ebong tap nirgoto kora** - While heat *is* emitted, that's a *result* of fusion, not what fusion *allows* you to do.
* **D: Hydrogen poromanu toiri kora** - The passage talks about hydrogen being the *starting point* of fusion, not being created *by* it.



"
Nicher konti karjokori fusion reactor toiri kore?,"The correct answer is **B: Tara (Stars)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hydrogen poromanugulo eksathe hye (baa sangjukto) bhari Upadan toirir Somoy utponno howaar shaktir karone tarader thekey aloo ebong tap nirgoto hoy."" This translates to: ""Hydrogen atoms combine to form heavier elements, and in the process release energy, causing stars to shine and become hot.""
* **The passage also mentions:** Scientists are working to create an artificial ""chulli"" (oven/reactor) that can create energy in the same way. This implies stars are *natural* fusion reactors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hydrogen:** Hydrogen is the *fuel* for fusion, not the reactor itself.
* **C: Poromanu (Atoms):** Atoms are the building blocks, but they don't *create* the reactor.
* **D: Shakti (Energy):** Energy is the *result* of fusion, not the reactor.



"
 joller rasayanik gothon ki?,"The correct answer is **D: 2ti hydrogen paramanu ebong 1ti oxygen paramanu**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Jougik joll 2ti hydrogen paramanu ebong 1ti oxygen paramanu niye gothito"" which translates to ""The compound water is formed by 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom.""
"
"Joller gothone poriborton holeo, konti eki thake?","The correct answer is **A: Anobik gothon (Molecular structure)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Er bahyik abostha poribortito holeo er rasayanik abostha Eki thaake."" which translates to ""Even if its physical state changes, its chemical state remains the same.""  The chemical state is determined by the *anobik gothon* (molecular structure) - how the atoms are connected.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ghonotto (Density)** - Density changes with physical state (solid, liquid, gas).
* **C: Bhouto obostha (Physical state)** - The passage specifically says the *physical state* can change.
* **D: Toral nitrogen (Total nitrogen)** - This is mentioned as an example of a chemical property, but isn't what stays the same when the state changes.

"Onucchhed onujaayi, Nirdishto ainguli aroper cheshta korar somoy terti rajyer jonyo nicher konti kono somosya chhilo naa?","The correct answer is **B: Congresser modhye khomotar obhab** (Lack of power within Congress).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""cor arop korar bishoye congresser kono khomota chhilo naa"" (Congress had no power regarding accusations of corruption).  This directly addresses the question of what problem *didn't* exist when trying to pursue accusations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Rajyo kortripokkher odhik todaroki** (Excessive interference from state courts) - The passage states state governments were *uncooperative* making this a problem.
* **C: Sangshodhaner jonyo sorbo somootite onumodoner prayojaniyota** (Requirement for unanimous consent for amendments) - The passage mentions amendments needed all states' consent, indicating this *was* a problem.
* **D: Jateeyo karjonirbahir astitwo na thaka** (Non-existence of a national executive) - The passage states there was no national executive or judicial committee, which *was* a problem.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Kon bakyoti biplobi juddher somoy kendriya sarkarer obostha nirbhulbhabe protipholito kore?","The correct answer is **D: Kendriya sarkar duiti upadan niye gothito hoyechhilo** (The central government was formed with two components).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Biplobi juddher somoy, confederationer nibondher adhine, terti rajya prothome ekti durbal kendriya sarkar gathon korechilo - jekhane congress er ekmatro ongsho chhilo."" (During the revolutionary war, under the Articles of Confederation, the third state first formed a weak central government - where Congress was the only part.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Congress o rajyo kortripokkho kortrik cor arop kora hoy** (Congress and state authorities had the power to levy taxes) - The passage says the opposite; Congress had *no* power to levy taxes, and relied on states.
* **B: Onucccheder sangshodhan Congresser kortritwer upore nirbhar karat** (Amendment of the articles depended on Congress's authority) - While amendments needed all states' consent, the passage focuses on the weakness of Congress, not its control over amendments.
* **C: Rajyo protinidhider uposthiti kom chhilo** (The presence of state representatives was low) - The passage states representatives *were* present, but were often disregarded. It highlights the states' disregard for the central government, not absenteeism.



"
Swadhinotar ghoshanar poschat diker shabdaguli kibhabe lekha chhilo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ulto kore** (In reverse).

The passage states: ""Lekhati nothipotrer ultodiker niche prodorshito hoy."" which translates to ""Written on the reverse side of the document."" This means the words were written backwards/in reverse on the back of the Declaration of Independence.



"
Singapur nicher kontir jonyo suporichito?,"The correct answer is **A: Nogore sobujayon (Urban greenery)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Singapur's botanic gardens helped transform the country into a ""city in a garden"" (krantiya uddaner shohore rupayntar). This directly relates to urban greenery.
* **The passage also mentions:** The national flower is an orchid, further emphasizing the importance of plants and greenery in Singapore's identity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hiking:** While Singapore has some hiking trails, it's not primarily *known* for hiking.
* **C: Romanchokar khela (Adventure sports):**  Singapore isn't particularly famous for adventure sports.
* **D: Lolito kola (Fine arts):** While Singapore has a thriving arts scene, it's not its defining characteristic.



"
Vanda  miss jojaquim ki?,"The correct answer is **B: Ekti full** (A flower).

Here's why:

The passage states ""1981 saale vanda miss jojaquim name barnasankar ek orchidke dasher jateea full hisabe manoneet koraa hoyechilo"" which translates to ""In 1981, a hybrid orchid named Vanda miss Joaquim was recognized as the national flower.""  Therefore, Vanda miss jojaquim is a flower (specifically an orchid)."
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Gija pyramider kon utkorshota dekhe New Kingdom mishoriorder bismito howar kono karon chhilo na?","Correct answer: **C: Egulir akaar**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""gijar pyramider akaar ebong taader nirman projuktigoto utkorshota keu atikram korte pareni."" This translates to ""No one has been able to surpass the excellence of the shape and construction techniques of the Giza pyramids.""

The passage also says the New Kingdom Egyptians were amazed (""abak hoyechilen"") when seeing these ancient monuments.  The reason for their amazement was specifically because of the pyramids' shape (""akaar"") and construction techniques (""nirman projuktigoto"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Egulir boyes (Their age):** While the pyramids were old (over a thousand years), the passage doesn't state the Egyptians were amazed *because* of their age. They were already familiar with ancient monuments.
*   **B: Pathorer byabohar (Use of stone):** Using stone in construction wasn't new or surprising to the Egyptians.
*   **D: Egulir nirman (Their construction):** Although construction was excellent, the passage specifically mentions *shape* and construction together as the source of amazement. Shape is the more striking initial impression.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, trinobhoji prani brishtipater jonno kotha theke bhromon shuru kore?","The correct answer is **B: Uttor pahar**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Proti bochor octobore pray ded million trinobhoji prani brishtipater jonno **uttor pahar thekey** maaraa nodee periye dakkhin samabhumir dike bhromon korey.""  This directly translates to ""Every year in October, approximately a million herbivores start their migration for rainfall from the **northern highlands**...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Poschim somobhumi (Western plains):** The text doesn't mention starting the migration from the western plains.
*   **C: Dakkhin samabhumi (Southern plains):** They *move towards* the southern plains, but don't start there.
*   **D: Poshchim pahar (Western highlands):** The text specifically says *northern* highlands."
"Onucchhed onujaayi, trinobhoji prani april er kono ek somoye kon sthan chhere jay?","The correct answer is **B: Dakkhin samabhumi**.

Here's why:

The passage states the animals *leave* the southern plains (""dakkhin samabhumir dike bhromon korey"") and move north, crossing the Maraa River.  They then return north, cross the Maraa River again, and remain in the Serengeti area (including parks like Masai Mara) throughout April.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Serengeti anchal** - They *stay* in the Serengeti area.
*   **C: Maaraa nodee** - They *cross* the Maraa River, but don't leave *from* it.
*   **D: Masai maaraa national reserve** - This is a location *within* the Serengeti area where they stay.



"
Operation sealine kon desher akromon chhilo?,"The correct answer is **A: Germany**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ei akromonke germany code-name dikeche ''operation sealine''."" (This attack was given the code name ''Operation Sealine'' by Germany.)

Therefore, Operation Sealine was Germany's planned invasion."
Germany Britten er upore akromon ke ki bole?,"The correct answer is **B: Operation sealine**.

The passage states: ""Ei akromonke germany code-name dikeche ''operation sealine''."" (Germany has given the code name ""Operation Sealine"" to this attack.)

Therefore, Germany refers to the attack on Britain as ""Operation Sealine"".

"""Kontike """"italir """"italir africar deshgulo dokhol korar proyojoniyo dhap hisebe ullekh kora hoyni?""","The correct answer is **A: Mishore jahaj theke mukti pawa**.

Here's why:

The passage states Italy needed to ""chhei ditey hoy"" (free themselves) from the British blockade and ships to be able to transport troops across the Mediterranean and invade Africa.  This is a necessary step *before* they could occupy African countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Otirikto jahaj toiri kora (Building extra ships):** The passage says they *just* built four new ships, but that wasn't the primary goal related to occupying Africa.
* **C: Sainya proborton pyada protishtha kora (Establishing military footholds):** This is the *result* of being able to invade Africa, not a prerequisite step mentioned.
* **D: British ghati dhowngsho kora (Destroying British forts):**  The passage says they needed to *get past* the British forts (and ships) - not necessarily destroy them - to reach Africa.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Konti Italy er juddher prathomik lakshya hisebe bibechito hoyechhilo?","The correct answer is **A: Africar deshgulo dokhol kora (Conquering African countries)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Italir mull lakshya chhilo africar deshgulo. oi deshgulo dokhol koraa, taader ekti sainya proborton pyada darkar chhilo..."" which translates to ""Italy's main goal was the African countries. They needed to conquer those countries, and for that, they needed a military foothold...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Aro shoktishali senabahini o nevi protishtha kora (Establishing a stronger army and navy reputation):** While Italy was building ships, the primary *goal* wasn't just strength, it was to support the African conquest.
* **C: Mishorer jahajguli theke mukti pawa (To free themselves from the Egyptian ships):**  The passage states they needed to *defeat* British ships (including Egyptian ones) to achieve their goals, not just be free of them.
* **D: British ghati protishtha kora (Establishing British footholds):** This is the opposite of what Italy wanted to do. They needed to overcome British presence, not establish it.



"
Kara akromonkarir sathe bondhutwopurno somporko sthapon korechhilo?,"The correct answer is **B: Vichy farasi**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Era holo farasi loka jara 1940 saale germander saathe shanty protistha korechilo ebong lorai korar poriborte akromonkarider saathe kaaj korechilo."" (They were French people who established peace with Germany in 1940 and worked with the aggressors instead of fighting.) This clearly refers to the Vichy French government.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Germanra** - The text says the Vichy French *collaborated* with the Germans, not the other way around.
*   **C: American ra** - The Americans fought *against* the Germans and Vichy French.
*   **D: Free French** - The Free French fought *against* the Germans and Vichy French.



"
Operation dragon-e jorhito mitroshokti kara chhilo?,"The correct answer is **A: American o Mukto farasi** (American and Free French).

The text explicitly states: ""American ebong mukto farasi bahini matro dui saptaher modhye dakkhin franceke swadhin korey germanyr dike egie jachchilo."" This translates to ""American and Free French forces liberated southern France in just two weeks and advanced towards Germany.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Vichy farasi o American** - The text describes the Vichy French as collaborators with Germany, not participants in Operation Dragon.
* **C: German o farasi** -  The operation was *against* Germany, not *with* them.
* **D: American o German** - Again, the operation was against Germany.



"
Kon projuktir bikasher phole dubojahaj joler niche cholachol korte shuru kore?,"The correct answer is **C: Navigation**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Juddher shurute dubojahaj samudra upore jataoat korto kintu **rudder srishti howar ebong sothik tothyo deoar kaaron** ee jaate dekha naa jaa ejonno ogulo joler niche jete badhyo hoy."" 

This translates to: ""At the beginning of the war, submarines would surface, but because of the creation of the rudder and **correct navigational data**, they couldn't be seen, so they were forced to go underwater.""

Therefore, advancements in **navigation** (specifically, the rudder and accurate data for its use) enabled submarines to reliably operate underwater.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: U-Boat:**  U-Boat is the *name* German submarines were called, not the technology that allowed them to submerge.
*   **B: Shutinger porishor (Shooting range):** The passage mentions limited shooting range as a drawback of early submarines, but not as a reason they started submerging.
*   **D: Radar:** Radar wasn't a significant factor in the *early* development of submarine navigation. It became more relevant later.



"
"Prothom byaboharer somoy, Dubojahaj er kon khetre khub e  simito porisor chhilo?","The correct answer is **C: Shuting kora**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""fire aasaar pore taaraa khubi dhirgatir hoyechilo ebong taader **shutingyer khub simito porisor** chhilo.""  This directly translates to ""after the initial impact, they became very slow and their **shooting range was very limited**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Navigate kora (Navigation):** The text mentions they had to go underwater because being seen on the surface was a problem, implying navigation wasn't the initial limitation.
*   **B: Chalachal kora (Movement):** The text says they became *slow* (dhirgatir), not that their ability to move was initially limited.
*   **D: Operate kora (Operation):** While operating a submarine is complex, the text specifically points to the limited shooting range as a primary early drawback.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, kara ekti chukti langghan kore? ","The correct answer is **D: Seviet**.

The passage explicitly states: ""seviet unifoner 800,000 lalfage riga shanty chukti langghan korey purbo pelyander elakaguli dokhol korey belarush oo ukraine ddhuke juddher front kheale."" This translates to: ""Soviet forces, with 800,000 soldiers, violated the Riga peace treaty, occupied areas of Eastern Poland, and entered Belarus and Ukraine, opening the war front.""

Therefore, the Soviet Union is the entity that violated the treaty.
"
Nicher konti Red Army porichalona koreni?,"The correct answer is **C: Bridghead dhorey punargathan koraa (Re-establishing a bridgehead)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Polish plan was to *attempt* to re-establish a bridgehead, but that this plan was immediately cancelled. The Red Army did not *perform* this action.  Instead, they invaded.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukrainian front protishtha (Establishing a Ukrainian front)** - The passage explicitly states the Red Army entered Ukraine, thus establishing a front.
*   **B: Poshchima oncholgulite akromon (Attacking Western territories)** - Entering Belarus and Ukraine represents an attack on territories to Poland's east (which were west relative to the Soviet Union).
*   **D: Ekti chukti langghan (Violating a treaty)** - The passage clearly states the Red Army violated the Riga Pact.



"

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bardier purbodik thekey akraman korey britishra italir dasham senabahinir mukhyo engineer general lastuchike atok korey."" This directly translates to ""Bardier attacked from the west and the British stopped the chief engineer of the Italian Tenth Army, Lastuchiko.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Take Tobruk-e hotya kora hoy** (He was murdered in Tobruk) - While Marshal Italo Balbo was killed near Tobruk, the text doesn't mention the engineer being murdered there.
*   **C: Take British-ra atok korechhilo** (He had stopped the British) - The text states the *British* stopped him, not the other way around.
*   **D: Tini frendly fire a nihoto hon** (He was killed by friendly fire) - The text doesn't mention anything about friendly fire.



"
Italo Balbo kothay nihoto hon?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk**.

The text states: ""Libari governor-general ebong musolinir prokrito uttoradhikari marshal italo balbo 28 shhey june tobruke namar somoy porichito bekti dwara gulibiddho hoye maaraa jaan."" This translates to: ""The Libyan Governor-General and Mussolini's true successor, Marshal Italo Balbo, was shot and killed by an unidentified person while near Tobruk on June 28th.""

Therefore, Italo Balbo was killed in Tobruk."
"Onucchhed onujaayi, nicher konti Tibbati dhyaner ekti gurutwopurno koushal?","The correct answer is **C: Debotwo shokti onudhabon** (Following/cultivating divine power).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Tibbati dhyaner kendravindu holo debotto jega."" (The center point of Tibetan meditation is divine awakening).  It further explains that through *debatto shakti onudhaboner madhyome* (through the practice of divine power), energy is purified, chakras are activated, and consciousness is created.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shwas-proshwaser byayam** (Breathing exercises) - While mentioned as a method to awaken Kundalini, it's not the *central* focus of Tibetan meditation according to the text.
*   **B: Montrer punorabritti** (Repetition of mantras) - Also mentioned as a method to awaken Kundalini, but not the primary focus.
*   **D: Jog onushilon ayotto kora** (Practicing yoga continuously) - Yoga is mentioned as a broader influence, but *debatto shakti onudhabon* is pinpointed as the core of Tibetan meditation.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Tibboti dhyaner “kendravindu”r somoy chakra kibhabe sokriyo hoy?","The correct answer is **B: Debotto shakti onudhaboner madhyome**.

This directly translates to: ""The central point of Tibetan meditation is awakening the deity. Through the practice of embodying divine power, the energies are purified, the chakras are activated, and consciousness is created.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bivinno jog anushilaner madhyome (Through various yogic practices):** While yogic practices are mentioned generally, the text specifically links chakra activation to *devotional* power, not just any yogic practice.
*   **C: Montrer punorabrittir madhyome (Through repetition of mantras):** Mantras are mentioned as a method of Kundalini awakening, but not directly linked to chakra activation within the context of Tibetan *dhyan* (meditation).
*   **D: Shwas- proshasher byayam (Breathing exercises):** Breathing exercises are also a part of Kundalini awakening, but not directly stated as the method for chakra activation in Tibetan meditation.



"
anushthan cholakale ke bhoktimulok geet uposthapon koren?,"The correct answer is **A: Sanju shorma**.

The text states: ""Gayak Sanju shormake diye sondhyar shuru hoyechilo..."" which translates to ""The evening began with singer Sanju Sharma..."" and implies he presented the devotional songs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lakka sing:** Lakka Sing led the bhajan *during* the Chhappan Bhog offering, he didn't start the event with devotional songs.
* **C: Raju Khandelwal:** Raju Khandelwal was a musician accompanying others, not the primary presenter of the devotional songs.
* **D: Joy shankar chaudhuri:** Joy Shankar Chaudhuri presented the Chhappan Bhog meal, not the devotional songs.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Khabar poribeshoner somoy k bhoktimulok songeet uposthapon koren?","The correct answer is **A: Lakka sing**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lakka sing bhajan gaane netritto nillen Baba Shyamke chhappan bhoger 108 rokomer plate poribeshon koraa hoyechilo. Laksa singo chhappan bhog bhajan uposthapon korechilen."" This directly translates to ""Lakka Sing led the bhajan singing while presenting 108 types of plates to Baba Shyam for Chhappan Bhog. Laksa Sing presented the Chhappan Bhog bhajan.""

Therefore, Lakka Sing is the one who presented the devotional music (bhajan) during the offering of Chhappan Bhog.



"
Sondhyar ditwiyo-shesh poribeshona ki chhilo?,"The correct answer is **B: Fayar off Anatolia**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sheshe, turkey nacher doll fayar off anatolia """"""""troy"""""""" poribeshon corol."" This directly translates to ""Finally, the Turkish dance troupe Fayar off Anatolia presented the 'Troy' environment.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sejena Aksu , Alessandro Safina o Harris Alexeo** - These are singers who performed *before* the final performance.
*   **C: Whirling Dervishes** - While mentioned in the passage, this was an earlier part of the show, not the final presentation.
*   **D: Fatih Erkoç o Müslüm Gürses** - These are singers mentioned as part of the Istanbul symphony orchestra, also not the final performance.



"
Alessandro safina-r jateeyota ki?,"The correct answer is **D: Italian**.

The text explicitly states: ""Turkey gaicka sejena aksu **italian gakok alessandro safina** ebong greek gakok harris alexeor saathe gaana gechechilo."" (Turkey's singer Sejena Aksu sang with **Italian singer Alessandro Safina** and Greek singer Harris Alexiou).
"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, nicher kon bakyoti sothik noy?","The correct answer is **A: Santa clarate agun legechhilo (There was a fire in Santa Clara)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""eti santa clarer 90 doshoker ekti goromer din chhilo"" which translates to ""it was a hot summer day in Santa Clara of the 90s"".  This refers to the *weather* being hot, not a fire.
* **The passage supports:**
    * **C: Jaatrider paani dea hoyechilo (Passengers were given water):**  ""90 degree (phaa) taper modhye abosthan korar somoy jatrider paani dea hoyechilo"" - Passengers were given water while waiting in the 90-degree heat.
    * **B: Lokjon ekti roller coastere atka porhechhilo (People were stuck on a roller coaster):** ""Kono roller coastere atka padaa je kono doirghyer somoyi aswastikar hobey"" - People were stuck on a roller coaster which caused discomfort.
    * **D: Prothom byaktike ride theke namate 60 minute somoy legechhilo (It took the first person 60 minutes to get off the ride):** ""prothom bektike nami ante kompokkhe ek ghanta somoy legechilo"" - It took roughly an hour for the first person to get off.



Therefore, only option A is not supported by the provided text."
"Onucchhed onujaayi, aswastikor tapmatra niye ke montobyo korechhilen?","The correct answer is **C: Jaatrira (Passengers)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kono roller coastere atka padaa je kono doirghyer somoyi aswastikar hobey, bolte gele, prothom bektike nami ante kompokkhe ek ghanta somoy legechilo."" This translates to: ""To mention that being stuck on a roller coaster for a long time would be uncomfortable, it took the first person to name it about an hour."" 

This clearly refers to the *experience of the passengers* being uncomfortable while stuck on the roller coaster. The discomfort is what prompted someone to quantify the unpleasantness (taking an hour to name it).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rider operator:** The passage doesn't mention the operator's concern with discomfort.
*   **B: Fayar captain:** Captain Scott Couns is mentioned, but in relation to a historical event, not the discomfort of riders.
*   **D: Police chief:** There's no mention of a police chief in the context of discomfort.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tongate kono brorokomer khokkhotir khabar temon bhabe paoa jaanori, shudhu elakar bidyut sangjog asthai bhabe bichchinno hoye gichechilo."" This translates to: ""No news of major damage was received in Tonga, only the local electricity connection was temporarily disconnected.""

Therefore, the electricity connection was disrupted in Tonga due to the tsunami.

The passage states: ""Tongate kono brorokomer khokkhotir khabar temon bhabe paoa jaanori, shudhu elakar bidyut sangjog asthai bhabe bichchinno hoye gichechilo."" This translates to: ""No reports of damage were received in Tonga, only the local electricity connection was temporarily disrupted.""  Crucially, it also says the tsunami warning issued by Pitidoblucy *wasn't* received by the Tongan authorities (""pitidoblucy je sunamir satarkabarta jaari korechilo, ta tongan kortripokkher kachhe pouchoni bole jaanaa gikeche."") because of the disrupted communication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kicchu khotir report pawa giyechhilo** (Some reports of damage were received) - The passage specifically says *no* damage reports were received.
*   **C: Somudroprishther reading akranto hoyechhilo** (Sea level readings were unavailable) - The passage doesn't mention anything about sea level readings being unavailable. It focuses on the communication breakdown.
*   **D: Kortripokkho kono songslishto sotorkota somporke jante okkhom chhilo** (The authorities were unable to know about any revised alert) - While true *as a result* of the power outage, the passage emphasizes the *lack of news about the withdrawn alert* as the direct consequence.

Pulish Jonny raid’er gaari chalanor goti porimap korar jonyo kokhon tader radar gun byabohar korte sokkhom hoyechhilo?,"The correct answer is **C: Tini 160km/ghonta gotite gaari chalanor somoy** (When he was driving at 160km/hour).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sheshbar jokhon taaraa mister raider gotir porimap korte perechilo tokhon Tini goti 160 kimmy proti ghontai namiechilen."" This directly translates to ""Finally, when they were able to measure Mr. Raider's speed, he was driving at 160 km/hour.""  This is the moment the police were able to use their radar gun (implied by ""gotir porimap korte perechilo"" - able to measure speed).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jokhon tini 160 kimmy/ghonta gotite gaari chalachchhilen** - While true he *was* driving that speed, it doesn't specify *when* the police could measure it. The passage details they initially *couldn't* determine his speed.
* **B: Tini brijti soptombar perunor somoy** - The passage doesn't mention any specific time of year or month.
* **D: Tini brijti prothombar perunor somoy** - The passage doesn't mention when he first crossed the bridge.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Jonny raid’er goti porimap kora new geland pulish er jonyo kothin chhilo keno?","The correct answer is **A: Tini 160kimmy/ghontar kom gotite gaari chalachhilen** (He was driving at a speed lower than 160km/hr).

Here's why:

The passage states the police had trouble measuring Mr. Reid's speed because they didn't know how fast ""Black Beauty"" was going.  It then says *when* they finally *were* able to measure his speed, it was 160 km/hr. This implies he was driving *under* that speed initially, making it difficult for them to accurately gauge his velocity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gaaritir goti khub dheer chhilo** (The car's speed was very slow) - The passage clearly states he was going 160 km/hr, which isn't slow.
* **C: Tini kebol bridger upore satbar gaari choloan** (He only drove seven times on the bridge) - This is irrelevant to the difficulty in measuring his speed.
* **D: Ockland harbour bridgeti khub e purono** (The Auckland Harbour Bridge is very old) - The bridge's age isn't mentioned as a factor in the speed measurement issue.



"
Butter dik theke bhumikamper kendra kothay chhilo?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 mail dakkhine** (40 miles south).

The text states: ""Bhumikamper kendra chhilo dealon thekey 20 kimmy (15mail) uttor-uttor purbo dike, ebong **butter 65 kimmy (40mail) dakkhine**."" 

This directly translates to: ""The earthquake's epicenter was 20 km (15 miles) north-northeast of Dealon, and **40 miles south of Butter**.""
"
Abu garib-e dangar somoye ki ghotechhilo?,"The correct answer is **A: Bondider atyachar** (Torture of prisoners).

The passage explicitly states that the Abu Ghraib prison became notorious *after* instances of prisoner abuse were discovered. While the other options are mentioned in the passage, they are consequences *of* the abuse, not what *happened* during the riot.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Lockdown:** While a lockdown likely occurred *after* the riot and discovery of abuse, it wasn't the event itself.
*   **C: Markin bahini dayitto grahan korechilo:** (American forces took responsibility) - This is a result of the events, not what happened *during* the riot.
*   **D: Karagare jalibe deyaa hoy:** (The prison was set on fire) - This is also stated as happening, but the main reason for the notoriety was the torture.



"
Iraqer karagar kukhyato hoyechilo keno? ,"The correct answer is **D: Bondider atyachar korar khobor paoa giyechhilo** (News of torture of prisoners was received).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Karagare bondider atyacharer khonj paoar pore karagarti kukhyato hoyechilo"" which directly translates to ""The prison became notorious after reports of torture of prisoners were found.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eti jalibe deyaa hoyechhilo** (It was set on fire) - While the passage mentions it ""jalibe deyaa hoyeche"" (was set on fire), this isn't *why* it became famous.
* **B: Markin bahini dayitto grahan korechhilo** (The US military took responsibility) - Taking responsibility came *after* it was famous, not the reason for its notoriety.
* **C: Sekhane besh kichhu danga hoyechhilo** (There were a lot of riots there) - The passage mentions ""danga"" (riots) as a time reference, but doesn't say riots made it famous.



"
 Moiepor ory memories stadym-e ki dhoroner event howar kotha chhilo?,"The text states ""Bandti moiepor ory memories stadym, jeta 9000 loka er uposthitir jonno toiri chhilo..."" which translates to ""The concert at Moiepor Ory Memories Stadium, which was prepared for the presence of 9000 people...""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Concert**.



"
Shobsheshe ke event batiler bishoye byakhya diyechhilo?,"The correct answer is **B: Porichalona sanstha** (The management organization).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bandtir porichalona sanstha eichke management nigam 20'ii september batil korey deoar pore kono prathomik kaaron deyoni, tobe porer dinei jouktik karoner dosharap korechilen."" This directly translates to: ""The band's management organization, EICKE Management Nigam, cancelled September 20th without giving an initial reason, but offered a logical explanation the next day."" 

Therefore, the management organization (Porichalona sanstha) is the one that explained the cancellation.



"
Bishkeker basindara lunthaner jonyo kader doshi bhebechhilen?,"The correct answer is **C: Protibadkarider**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bishkeker besh kichhu basinda ainshrinkhalar ghatotir jonno dakkhiner protibadkarider dosh dikechen.""  This directly translates to ""Many residents of Bishkek blamed the southern protesters for the deterioration of law and order.""

Therefore, the residents of Bishkek believed the protesters were to blame for the looting.



"
Lunthaner jonyo dakkhiner protibadkarider kara dosharop korechhilo?,"The correct answer is **A: Bishkeker basindara** (Residents of Bishkek).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bishkeker besh kichhu basinda ainshrinkhalar ghatotir jonno dakkhiner protibadkarider dosh dikechen."" This translates to ""Many residents of Bishkek blamed the southern protesters for the deterioration of law and order.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ain proyogkari kormokortader** (Law enforcement officials): The text mentions they weren't present, not that they were blamed.
*   **C: Noirajyobadira** (Anarchists): While the text describes *why* Bishkek was called ""arajakata"" (anarchy), it doesn't say protesters blamed anarchists.
*   **D: Lokjoner dall** (Group of people): Too vague. The text specifically points to the *residents* of Bishkek.



"

The text explicitly states: ""Siminoff bolechilen je 2013 saale shark tanker ekti episode jaoar pore thekey tar bikroy bedeche..."" (Siminoff said that sales increased after appearing in an episode of Shark Tank in 2013...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 2013 sale tohobil pawar por** - While 2013 is mentioned, the increase in sales happened *after* the Shark Tank episode, not just the year.
*   **C: qvc-tee procharer por** - QVC appearance is mentioned, but it's not stated that sales increased because of it.
*   **D: ADT er sathe ekti mamla nishpottir por** - The settlement with ADT is a separate event and not linked to increased sales."

"
Protiti reading rainbow porbo shishuder kisher byapare agrohi korto?,"The correct answer is **B: Sthaniyo library**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Protiti anusthan boiepor jonno superish sarbaraho korbe jeguli shishuder khonja uchito jokhon taaraa taader libraryte jaabe."" 

This translates to: ""Every episode will specifically direct children to find resources when they go to their library."" 

Therefore, *Reading Rainbow* encourages children to visit their local libraries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Television show** - While *Reading Rainbow* *is* a television show, the text focuses on what it encourages children to do *after* watching.
*   **C: Theme** - The text mentions themes are used in the show, but it's not what the show directly encourages children to pursue.
*   **D: Boi (Book)** - While books are central to the show, the text highlights the library as the place to *find* the books.



"
Konti reading rainbow sirij shesh korar khetre bhumika rekhechilo?,"The correct answer is **A: Tohobiler ghatoti**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""John grant soho kichhu loka eti biswas korey je **tohobiler ghatoti** ebong televisione shikkhamulak anusthaner proti jhonk ubhayi ei sirijti shes korte bhumika rekhechilo."" (John Grant and some others believed that **declining viewership** and a backlash against educational programming on television played a role in ending the series).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ammy purashkarer ghatoti** - The passage mentions PBS shows winning awards but doesn't link this to the show's cancellation.
*   **C: John Grant’er motamot** - While John Grant is mentioned, the passage states *others* shared the belief about declining viewership.
*   **D: Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood er sapholyo** - The passage contrasts *Reading Rainbow* with *Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood* but doesn't suggest the latter's success led to the former's end.



"
Nicher konti Amsterdam o jadugharer jonyo gachtir bishoye kormokortader bola kono jukti chhilo na?,"Correct answer: **A: Eti onibarjobhabe bhenge porbe**

Here's why:

The passage states Anne Frank's house was potentially infected with a fungus and could pose a health risk, leading to discussions about demolition. The concern was about public health and potential danger. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Etik songrokkhon kora uchit** (It should be protected) - The passage describes a debate about *whether* to protect it, ultimately leaning towards demolition due to health risks.
*   **C: Eti fungus akranto** (It is fungus infected) - This *is* mentioned in the passage as a reason for concern.
*   **D: Eti jonoswasther jonyo bipodjonok** (It is dangerous for public health) - This is also stated directly in the passage.

The passage does *not* offer a justification that it will simply collapse on its own (""Eti onibarjobhabe bhenge porbe""). The reasons given are related to the fungus and public health. Therefore, option A is the statement that isn't a reason provided in the text."
"Rspcaer chief inspectorer mote, nicher kontir khetre tadaraki mansommoto howa uchit?","The correct answer is **D: Kosaikhana (Slaughterhouses)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Rspca new south wellser chief inspector david oo'shanesi abc-key bolechen je **australier kasaikhanate** najardari oo tadarkir procholon haoya uchito.""  This directly translates to ""RSPCA New South Wales chief inspector David O'Shannessy told ABC that **in Australian slaughterhouses** covert and monitoring practices should be increased.""

Therefore, the chief inspector specifically mentioned that monitoring (tadarki) is needed in slaughterhouses (kosaikhana).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cctv camera:** While CCTV cameras *are* the method of monitoring, they aren't the *location* where monitoring is needed.
*   **B: Poshu niye kaj kore emon je karo jonyo (For those who work with animals):** The text doesn't focus on monitoring people, but rather practices *within* a specific location.
*   **C: Najardari procholon (Covert practices):** This is *what* needs to be monitored, not *where*.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Australier  kasaikhanar kormider kache poshur kalyaner gurutwoke joralo korte konti sahajyo korte pare?","The correct answer is **A: Cctv camera lagano (Installing CCTV cameras)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the RSPCA is advocating for CCTV cameras to be installed in Australian slaughterhouses ""badhyotamulok bhabe"" (compulsorily) to improve animal welfare. David O'Shanesy mentions that CCTV will help ensure animals are treated with appropriate consideration and welfare is prioritized.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Rspca-er sathe badhytamulok meeting (Compulsory meetings with the RSPCA):** The passage doesn't mention compulsory meetings.
* **C: Kasaikhanai niyomito tadaraki (Regular inspections of slaughterhouses):** While the passage mentions ""najardari oo tadarkir procholon haoya uchito"" (monitoring and inspection should continue), it frames CCTV as a *support* to that, not the primary solution itself.
* **D: ABC theke najardari (Monitoring from ABC):** ABC is simply the news outlet reporting the story; they aren't the solution for improving animal welfare.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, je byaktike greptar kora hoyechhe tar pesha ki?","The correct answer is **A: Chhatro (Student)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""21'shhey marcher school humler ghotonai arek **chhatroke** greptar korar khabar chhoriye porechilo."" This directly translates to ""news of another **student** being arrested in connection with the 21st March school shooting was received.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Miniapolis star-tribuneer ekjon sangbadik (A journalist from the Minneapolis Star-Tribune):** The passage mentions a journalist being *told* information, but the arrested person isn't the journalist.
*   **C: Tribal cherman (Tribal Chairman):**  The passage identifies Flaced Jordan as the tribal chairman, and states the arrested person is his son.
*   **D: Red Lake-er kortripokkho (Red Lake Court):** The court is involved in the legal process but isn't the person arrested.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, arekti greptar korar khabar porhar somoye, kotojon bhuktobhogir jonyo antyeshtikriya kora hoyechhilo?","The correct answer is **B: Tinjan**.

This translates to: ""Jeff heard and nine victims for whose funeral was being held due to the Reed Lake community's 21st March school humiliation incident, news of another student's arrest was left.""

Therefore, the funeral was for three victims (tinjaner = three people's)."
"Kon desh bikkhuber byapare shara dewar jonyo, tader swakkharito acta  chukti niye egiye aseni?","The correct answer is **B: Polyand**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Goto masse polyande acta chukti swakkhar howar pore seey deshe boro dharoner bikkhov hoyechilo , jaar foley polisha sarkar apatoto chuktiti anumodan naa korar siddhanta niyeche."" This translates to: ""After the Gotto Masse Polyand Act was signed, large-scale protests erupted in several countries, following which the Polish government decided not to approve the ratification.""

This clearly indicates that Polyand signed the act, which *led* to protests and Poland's refusal to ratify it. The question asks which country *didn't* proceed with signing the act due to protests, and Polyand fits that description based on the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **Germany:** The text states Germany had protests *in* its cities, but doesn't say it didn't sign the act.
*   **Scotland:** The text mentions protests *in* Scotland (Edinburgh and Glasgow), but not that Scotland refused to sign.
*   **Lithuania:** The text mentions protests *in* Lithuania (Vilnius), but states Lithuania delayed contributing to the act, not refusing it altogether.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, nicher kon desh acta-te jog dewar prokriyate bilombo korar siddhanta niyechhilo?","The correct answer is **D: Latvia**.

The passage states: ""Latvia ebong slovakia duti deshi acta-tee jogdaner prokriyate bilamba korechilo"" which translates to ""Latvia and Slovakia delayed the process of contributing to the act.""

Therefore, Latvia is the correct answer."

The text states: ""...charjan loka alpo puei gichechen"" which translates to ""...four people slightly injured."" This refers to the injuries related to the iPod overheating incidents.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 27** - This number refers to the number of accidents related to devices (not specifically injuries from iPod overheating).
* **C: 6** - The text mentions 60 incidents, but not 6 injuries.
* **D: 34** - This number refers to additional incidents found by METI concerning Apple, not injuries from the iPod overheating.



"
Ke uttopto howar ghotonaguli beshi gurutoro noy bole montobyo korechhilen?,"The correct answer is **D: Apple**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""montronaloy appler ei protibedontike sthogito koraa khubi afsosjoggo bole uttor diyeche."" which translates to ""the ministry expressed regret for accepting Apple's report."" This implies Apple downplayed the seriousness of the incidents, and the ministry found this unacceptable. Therefore, Apple is the one who presented the events as less serious.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Meti:** Meti actually *expressed regret* at Apple's response, meaning they wanted the incidents taken more seriously.
*   **B: Songslishto iPod malikra:** The text doesn't mention the owners' opinions on the matter.
*   **C: Japan er ogni bibhag:** The fire department is mentioned in relation to *one* specific incident, not as having an opinion on the overall seriousness.



"
"Stibha joves tar boktritar somoy, Apple konti punoray udbhabito korte cholechhe bole ullekh koren?","The correct answer is **B: Phone**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Apple aaj **phonetike** punoray udbhabito korte choleche..."" which translates to ""Apple today is striving to reinvent the **phone**...""

The quote directly mentions the reinvention of the *phone* itself, not history, the company, or technology in general.



"
stibha joveser 2 ghantar boktritar uddeshyo ki chhilo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ekti notun phone niye asha (To announce a new phone)**.

Here's why:

The passage states (in Bengali) that Steve Jobs (referred to as ""stibha joves"") took an iPhone from his pocket and showed it to the public *after* a two-hour speech. He then said, ""Apple is about to reinvent the phone, we are about to make history."" This clearly indicates the purpose of the speech was to unveil a new phone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ekti notun tablet niye asha (To announce a new tablet):** The passage specifically mentions an iPhone, not a tablet.
*   **B: Ekti notun computer niye asha (To announce a new computer):** Again, the passage focuses on the *phone*.
*   **D: Tar oboshorer ghoshona dewa (To announce his retirement):** While Steve Jobs *did* eventually retire, this passage doesn't suggest that was the purpose of this particular speech. It's about a product launch.



"
Cristina fernandej die kirchner argentine thiegtere ki ghoshona den?,"The correct answer is **A: Tar rashtrapati padaprarthi** (Her candidacy for president).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...christina fernandej die kirchner **tar rashtrapati padaprarthi howar daabee ghoshana korechilen**"" which translates to ""...Cristina Fernández de Kirchner **announced her claim to be a presidential candidate**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tar senate porichalona korar ichhar** (Her desire to manage the senate) - The text mentions her past as a senate representative, but not a desire to *manage* it now.
*   **C: Tar Buenos Aires prodesher protinidhi borger procharonar** (Her campaign to be a representative of Buenos Aires) - While she *started* her campaign from Buenos Aires, the announcement is about the presidential candidacy, not a representative role.
*   **D: Tar bortoman senator pod tyager porikolponar** (Her contemplation of resigning from her current senatorial position) - The text doesn't mention anything about resigning.



"
Cristina fernandej die kirchner tar ichha bastobyoner byapare kothay ghoshana korechilen?,"The correct answer is **B: Lah platat-r buens ires thiegtere**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Misses karchner president prarthi hisebe laroj ichcha prakash korey ghoshana dikechen **argentine thiegtere, eki jaygay jekhan thekey seey 2005 saale buens ires prodesher senate pratinidhi doler sabhya howar procharona shuru korechilen.**""  This translates to: ""Mrs. Kirchner announced her desire to run for president at an Argentine theater, the same place where she began her campaign to become a member of the Senate of Buenos Aires province in 2005.""

The passage also mentions ""Lah platate bortoman senator"" (current senator from La Plata), indicating the theater is located in Buenos Aires (Buens Ires) near La Plata. Therefore, the location is the theater in Buenos Aires (Buens Ires) near La Plata.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lah platat theke 31 mail doorer ekti thiegtere** - The passage mentions 31 miles distance, but doesn't specify that's the distance *from* La Plata to the theater.
*   **C: Buens ires theke 31 mile dure argentine thiegtere** - While it might be 31 miles from Buenos Aires, the crucial detail is its location *near* La Plata.
*   **D: Buens ires er Lah platat thiegtere** - The theater isn't *in* La Plata, but near it, in Buenos Aires.



"
Big Brotherer bishoye acma ki khunje peyechhilo?,"The correct answer is **C: Censorship ain langghan kora hoyechhilo (Censorship law was violated)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...big brother website mediati sanrakkhan naa howar karone big brother online content censorship aain langghan koren nee."" This translates to: ""...because the Big Brother website does not have media protection, Big Brother violates the online content censorship law.""

Therefore, the finding is that Big Brother *did* violate censorship laws.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Censorship aaien langghan kora hoyni (Censorship law was not violated):** This is the opposite of what the passage states.
*   **B: Big Brother er website mediati sangrakkhito obosthay pawa jay (Big Brother's website can be found in a protected media state):** The passage explicitly says the website *lacks* media protection.
*   **D: Ekti servere sharirikbhabe content er obosthan pawa jay (The content's physical location can be found on a server):** While the passage mentions content needing a physical server to be considered internet material, it doesn’t state whether Big Brother's content *was* found on one. The core finding is about the censorship law."
Internet content hisebe bibechito howar jonyo media ke kon parameter er modhey porte hobe?,"The correct answer is **B: etike aboshyoi sharirikbhabe ekti surveray thakte hobey** (It must necessarily have a physical server).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...tobe internet samagri hisabe bibechito hote hole etike aboshyoi sharirikbhabe ekti surveray thakte hobey."" ( ""...but if it is to be considered internet content, it must necessarily have a physical server."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ekti ke oboshyoi internete stream kora hobe** (It must necessarily be streamed on the internet) - Streaming is *how* content is delivered, not a defining characteristic of whether it *is* content.
* **C: Eti kono website a sangrakkhan kora jabe na** (It cannot be stored on any website) - The passage states the opposite, that websites avoiding storage are the reason for the potential legal issues.
* **D: Eti acma kortrik anumodito hote hobe** (It must be approved by the authorities) - The passage doesn't mention any approval process.



"
Austraileer liberal party-r neta ke chhilen?,"The correct answer is **A: Pitter koshtelo**.

The text explicitly states: ""Pitter koshtelo, austraileer orthopal ebong liberal party-raw neta hisabe sombhoboto prodhanmontri..."" which translates to ""Peter Costello, as a potential prime minister and leader of the Liberal Party of Australia..."". 

Therefore, Peter Costello was the leader of the Liberal Party.



"
Australia er ekhono kono paromanobik shakti shilpo ney keno?,"The correct answer is **D: Khubi byaybahul (Very expensive)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Costello believes Australia should pursue nuclear power *when it becomes economically viable* (""jokhon orthonoitikbhabe sofol hoy""). He explicitly says they should adopt it *if* it becomes commercially viable (""jodi etaa banijyik hye yay""). This implies the current barrier is the cost.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Jano sohayotar obhab (Lack of public support):** While public opinion might be a factor, the passage focuses on *economic* viability, not public acceptance.
*   **B: Khubi bitorkito (Highly controversial):** Controversy isn't directly mentioned as a reason *why* Australia doesn't have nuclear power, only that it *should* be considered if economically sound.
*   **C: Khubi bipodjonok (Highly dangerous):** Costello doesn't express concern about the danger of nuclear power, only its cost. He seems open to it if economically feasible.



"

The text states: ""Polyander purushder drishti protibondhi bibhager skitchalock Mckiage crajel ebong guide Anna ogarjinska super-jee-tee terotomo sthane royechen."" This translates to ""Polyander's visually impaired category skier Mckiage crajel and guide Anna ogarjinska finished 13th in the super-G.""

Therefore, Anna ogarjinska is a guide who assists a skier in competition.
"
Kon desh Super-G-te mohila protijogider modhye dashom sthan adhikar kore?,"The correct answer is **B: Netherland**.

The text states: ""Taaraa netherlandke antarbhukta korey, anna jochemsen er super-g tee mahila protijogider modhye nobom sthan adhikar korar saathe..."" This translates to ""Including the Netherlands, Anna Jochemsen secured 9th place in the Super-G for women...""

While Katja Sarinen of Finland got 10th place, the question asks which *country* achieved a 10th place finish. The text specifically mentions Anna Jochemsen of the Netherlands getting 9th place in the Super-G for women, which is the closest information to the question. There is no mention of the Netherlands getting 10th place, so there may be a slight error in the question or the given text. However, given the options provided, the Netherlands is the most relevant country mentioned in connection to the Super-G women's competition.

"Onucchhed onujaayi, Black somporke kon bakyoti sothik noy?","The correct answer is **B: Tini akramaner kotha swikar koren** (He admits to the attack).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Oi ghotona je uposthapok greftar hechhen, Tini **akraman korar kotha aswikar korechen**"" (The accused arrested in the incident **denies the accusation of assault**).

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Take ghotonasthal theke greftar kora hoy** (He was arrested from the scene) - The passage states he was arrested (""greftar kora hoy"").
*   **C: Tini akramaner somoy ekti lathi byabohar koren** (He used a stick during the assault) - The passage states he used a stick to defend himself (""Tini lathiti byabohar korechen"").
*   **D: Tini dabi koren je tar dike botol chhurhe fela hoy** (He claims bottles were thrown at him) - The passage states he claims people threw bottles at him (""tar proti chhue deyaa botolgulo thekey nijeke rokkha korar jonno"").

Therefore, option B is the only statement that contradicts the information provided in the passage."
"Onucchhed onujaayi, nicher konti Blake-er kkhetre ghoteni?","The correct answer is **C: Take ekti lathi soho atok kora hoy (He was stopped with a stick)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Blake was *accused* of trying to corrupt the legal process (A).** It explicitly says he was found guilty of this charge.
* **The passage states Blake was arrested (B).** It says ""Oi ghotona je uposthapok greftar hechhen"" (The supporter who was present was arrested). While the passage doesn't directly say *Blake* was arrested, the context heavily implies he was the one arrested as the narrative focuses on his actions and defense.
* **The passage states the judge said sending him to jail was ""absolutely unavoidable"" (D).** This directly indicates Blake was told he might be imprisoned.
* **However, the passage *does not* mention Blake being physically stopped with a stick.**  Instead, it says *he* used a stick to defend himself from a crowd of over thirty people.

Therefore, option C is the only action not attributed to Blake or directly related to his case within the provided text.



"
Jatisangher  baishwik  ushnota tohobil kisher jonyo byabohrito hobe na?,"The correct answer is **A: fosoler boichitro (fossil fuels)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the UN hopes the fund will support things *like* resilient infrastructure, improved water management, and moving *away from* fossil fuels. This means the fund won't be used *for* fossil fuels, but rather to transition *away* from them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Unnahanshil deshe prajukti niye asa (Bringing technology to vulnerable countries):** The passage explicitly mentions the fund will help vulnerable countries cope with climate change, and technology transfer is part of that.
*   **C: bonna-protirodhi barighar (Resilient infrastructure):** The passage mentions this as a possible use of the fund.
*   **D: Baishwik ushnotar probhabguli dur kora (Mitigating the effects of global warming):** This is the overall goal and the fund is intended to *help* achieve this.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Jatishangha Ki bachanor protyasha kore?","The correct answer is **A: Ortho, prajukti share korar madhyome** ( অর্থ, প্রযুক্তি শেয়ার করার মাধ্যমে - Meaning, through sharing technology).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jatisangha baishwik ushnota dwara akranto deshguloke er prabhab mokabela korte sahajyo korar jonno tehbil churanto korar byapareo aasha korey."" (The United Nations also hopes to help countries affected by global warming by ensuring the availability of technology).

This directly translates to the UN hoping to help by *sharing technology*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: fosol (crops)** - While the passage mentions ""fosoler boichitrer dike jete paare"" (can move towards crop diversification), it's presented as a potential *result* of resilient systems, not what the UN *hopes to save*.
*   **C: Oboshishto brishti oronyo (remaining rainforests)** - The passage doesn't mention rainforests specifically.
*   **D: Onunnoto joll-byabosthapona (advanced water management)** - Similar to crops, this is a potential adaptation strategy, but not what the UN is primarily hoping to save or ensure availability of.



"
Albert muchanga kontike emon kichhu hishebe ullekh korenni jetir byapare ekhono ekmot howa proyojon?,"The correct answer is **C: Utsher niyomaboli (Rules of Origin)**.

Here's why:

The quote states: ""Commissioner bolechilen jee, """"""""amra ekhono utso ebong shulk chhader nimogulir bishoye ekmat noi, kintu 1'lah julai, 2020 tee lenden shuru korar jonno amader je kathamoti royeche tha jotheshto"""""""".""

This directly translates to: ""The Commissioner said, 'We are not yet unanimous on the rules of origin and the issue of tariff concessions, but we have the most important agreements to start lending on July 1, 2020.'""

""Utso ebong shulk chhader nimoguli"" refers to the *rules of origin* (utso) and *tariff concessions* (shulk chhada).  Albert Muchanga specifically mentions they haven't reached an agreement on these yet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Benin afcftate jog debe kina (Whether Benin should join AfCFTA)** - The passage mentions Benin *joining* but doesn't say there's disagreement about it.
*   **B: Je tarikhe lenden shuru hote parto (The date lending could start)** - The passage *states* the lending will start on July 1, 2020.  There's no disagreement about the date itself.
*   **D: Shulk chhad (Tariff concessions)** - While mentioned alongside rules of origin, the specific thing Muchanga says they haven't agreed upon is the broader concept of the *rules* governing origin - not just tariff concessions in isolation.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, keno July te lenden shuru hote pare?","The correct answer is **A: AfCFTA-te jogdaner jonyo July mash theke ekti shurur tarikh bechhe newa chhilo Nigeria er shortabolir ongsho.**

Here's why:

The passage states Nigeria *had already announced* its readiness to start implementing the AfCFTA, and Albert Muchanga announced Benin's joining. Muchanga then said they hadn't reached consensus on tariffs and duties, *but* they had the ""greatest understanding"" to start lending (presumably meaning implementation) from July 1, 2020. This directly implies July was a proposed start date for Nigeria's participation in AfCFTA.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage says they *haven't* agreed on tariffs and duties, so this is false.
* **C:** While Muchanga approved, the reason for July isn't *because* he approved. It was a pre-existing intention.
* **D:** The passage explicitly states they are *not* in agreement on tariffs and duties.

"Onucchhed onujaayi,  atlanta-journal sangbidhan shiksha adhikarikke ki karone abhijukto korechhilo?","The correct answer is **A: Journal-Constitution er protibedone aboidho probhab bistar** (Illegal expansion of influence in the Journal-Constitution report).

Here's why:

The passage states the Atlanta-Journal Constitution published a report showing exam scores had *drastically increased suspiciously*, and accused the educators of *covering up problems internally but acting on the results*. This points to manipulation of the exam results – an illegal expansion of influence to improve scores.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shahure shikkhay notunotwa ante byarthota** (Failure to bring innovation in excellent education) - The passage doesn't discuss a failure of innovation.
* **C: Shonakto kora abhyantarin somosyagulir byapare kono podokkhep na newa** (Not taking any action regarding the covered up internal problems) - While the passage says problems were covered up, the *accusation* that led to charges was the manipulation of the scores themselves, not just covering up problems.
* **D: Kom test scorer bishoye report kora** (Reporting on low test scores) - The report focused on unusually *high* scores, not low ones.



"
"Onucchhede prodotto tothyo onujaayi,  atlanta-journal sangbidhan er protibedone ki ullekh kora chhilo na?","The correct answer is **A: Test scorer oswabhabik unnoti (Abnormal increase in test scores)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Protibedone dekhano hoyechilo porikkhar scoreguli proshongshoniyobhabe drutobriddhi peyechilo..."" which translates to ""The report showed that the test scores had increased rapidly in a questionable manner..."" This directly refers to an abnormal or unnatural increase in test scores.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Proshnopotre oboidho hostokkhep kora hoyechhe tar proman (Evidence that cheating was done on the question papers)** - While the passage *leads* to the conclusion of cheating and ultimately results in accusations, the report itself highlighted the suspicious score increases, not direct proof of cheating on the papers *initially*.
*   **C: 2013 saler National Superintendent of the Year bijoyi (2013 National Superintendent of the Year winner)** - The passage mentions the superintendent's award, but it's not what the *Atlanta-Journal Constitution* report focused on.
*   **D: Shahure shikkhay notunotwa anar jonyo poramorsho (Advice to bring innovation in excellent education)** - This isn't mentioned in the passage at all.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, boma bishforoner pore ki jana giyechhilo?","The correct answer is **D: Sarkari hisabe mriter sankhya** (The number of deaths according to the government).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""sarkari reporte nischito koraa hoyeche je 30 jon ahoto hoyeche"" (the government report has confirmed that 30 people have been injured) and ""kichhu reporte sarkari bhabe att joner mrityur kotha bolla hoyeche"" (some reports mention the death of eight people officially). This directly addresses what was learned *after* the bombing – the reported number of deaths according to the government.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Churanto ahoter sankhya** (Exact number of injured) - The passage says the exact numbers are *still unknown* (""churanto sankhyaguli ekhono jaanaa yayni"").
*   **B: Je bhabaner kachhe boma bishforon hoyechhilo** (The buildings near where the bomb exploded) - This is *where* the bombing happened, not what was learned *after* the bombing.
*   **C: Aro boma bishforon hoto kina** (Whether more bombs exploded) - The passage states ""Due'ghantar modhye sarkari bhabaner kachhe aro tinti boma bishforito hoyechilo"" (Within two hours, three more bombs exploded near government buildings). This was stated as a fact, not something that was *learned* after the first explosion.



"
"2017 sale manchester sitite jogdaner por theke, Jeeshu  kotoguli match e khelechhilen?","The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The passage states that Jesus played in a total of 53 matches for the Brazilian club after joining Manchester City in January 2017."
Kon club e jogdaner jonyo jeeshu 27 million pound parishromik peyechhilen?,"The correct answer is **B: Manchester City**.

Here's why:

The text states ""21 bochor vayasi jeeshu goto bochore 2017 er januaryte manchester sitite brajilian club pulmeirus thekey ps 27 million dollar report fir jonno jogdan korechilen."" This translates to ""21-year-old Jesus in January 2017 joined Manchester City from Brazilian club Palmeiras for a £27 million transfer fee."" 

Therefore, Jesus received the £27 million from Manchester City."
Chhatrabaser otithider somporke kon bakyoti satyo noy?,"The correct answer is **B: Kichhu otithi sthaniyo nagorik chhilen na** (Some guests were not local citizens).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Chhatrabaser atithira beshirbhagi sangjukto arob amirater nagrik chhilen."" This translates to ""Most of the hostel guests were from the United Arab Emirates and joint countries (presumably neighboring Arab nations).""  This *directly* contradicts option B, which claims *no* guests were local citizens.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

*   **A: Otithira hojj paloner jonyo Mokkay eshechhilen** (The guests had come to Mecca to perform Hajj) - The passage mentions many pilgrims were in the area before the Hajj pilgrimage.
*   **C: Otithira hojjer age sekhane chhilen** (The guests were there before the Hajj) - The passage states they were there ""age hojj tirthojatrar age.""
*   **D: Otithider odhikangshoi pobitro shohor theke eshechhilen** (The majority of the guests had come from the holy city) - While not directly stated that they're *from* Mecca, it's implied they're from nearby Arab countries and likely traveled to Mecca specifically for religious purposes.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, nicher kon bakyoti sotyi noy?","The correct answer is **D: Otithider odhikangshoi Mokkar sthaniyo basinda** (Most of the guests were local residents of Mecca).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Chhatrabaser atithira beshirbhagi sangjukto arob amirater nagrik chhilen"" - which translates to ""Most of the hostel guests were citizens of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia."" This directly contradicts option D.

Let's look at why the other options are true according to the passage:

* **A: Sekhane kono pranhani hoyni** (No one died there) - This is *false*, the passage states ""Mriter sankhya kompokkhe 15"" (The number of deaths is at least 15).  However, the question asks for the statement that is *not* true, and D is a better answer.
* **B: Sob otithira sangjukto arob amirat theke eshechhilen** (All the guests came from the UAE and Saudi Arabia) -  The passage says *most* (beshirbhagi) came from these countries, so this is a reasonable inference even if not stated as ""all"".
* **C: Otithira hojj paloner age sekhane chhilen** (The guests were there before the Hajj pilgrimage) - The passage states ""Hojj tirthojatrar age ei baertite chhilo"" (They were in this hostel before the Hajj pilgrimage), confirming this statement.



Therefore, **D** is the only statement demonstrably false based on the provided text."
"Onucchhed onujaayi,sangharshati somporke kon tothyoti nishchito noy?","The correct answer is **A: Sangharsher akar** (The size of the collision).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Taaraa ekhono eti nirdharoner chesta korchen je sangharshati kotota boro chhilo ebong etey prithibi kibhabe probhabito hobey."" This translates to: ""They are still trying to determine how big the collision was and how it will affect the Earth."" This clearly indicates the *size* of the collision is still uncertain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sangharsher obosthan** (Location of the collision) - The passage states it happened 491 miles above the Earth's surface, so the location is known.
* **C: Prithibir upore sangharsher probhab** (Impact of the collision on Earth) - While the *extent* of the impact is still being investigated, the passage acknowledges there *will* be an impact. The impact itself isn't uncertain, just its degree.
* **D: Dhwangsaboshesher abosthan** (Location of the debris) - The passage states the US Strategic Command is monitoring the debris, meaning its location is being tracked.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, sangharsher byapare ekhono konti nirdharon kora baki ache?","The correct answer is **D: Songghorsher sothik scale** (The actual scale of the collision).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Taaraa ekhono eti nirdharoner chesta korchen je sangharshati kotota boro chhilo ebong etey prithibi kibhabe probhabito hobey.""  This directly translates to: ""They are still trying to determine how big the collision was and how it will affect the Earth.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dhwongsaboshesher tracking ke porichalona korbe** (Who will conduct tracking of the debris) - The passage states the US Strategic Command is already monitoring debris.
*   **B: Sangharsher somoye satelliteguli kotota druto bhromon korchhilo** (How fast the satellites were moving at the time of the collision) - The passage *gives* the speed (17,500 miles per hour).
*   **C: Plotting bishleshoner pholaphol kibhabe share kora hobe** (How the results of the plotting analysis will be shared) - The passage states results will be posted on a public website, so the *method* of sharing is known.

Therefore, the only remaining uncertainty mentioned in the passage is the *size* or *scale* of the collision."
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Batten sobcheye dhoni american-der talikay kototomo sthane chhilen?","The correct answer is **C: 190 tom**.

The passage states: ""Batten 2008 saale americar sheersho 400 dhonir talika 190tom sthane chhilen..."" which translates to ""In 2008, Batten was in 190th place on the list of America's top 400 richest people...""
"
Batten kon protishthaner jonyo onudan diten?,"The correct answer is **B: Virginia bishwobidyaloy**.

The text states that Batten graduated from the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Virginia and was a distinguished alumnus of that institution. This implies a continued connection and likely philanthropic support. The text doesn't mention donations to any other organizations listed in the options."
Konti governor arnold shoarjonegar swakkhorito biller ongsho chhilo na?,"The correct answer is **C: California er bairer olpoboyoskoder kachhe sohingso video game er bbikroy baa vada dewar upore nishedhagga.**

Here's why:

The passage states the bill prohibits the *sale or rental of violent video games to minors* (apraptavayaskader kachhe). Option C incorrectly states it prohibits sales to *all* people outside of California (California er bairer olpoboyoskoder).  The bill specifically targets minors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: California jurhe olpobayoskoder kachhe sohingso video game er bikroy baa vada dewar upore nishedhagga:** This is a restatement of what the bill *does* do, so it's not what's *missing* from the bill.
*   **B: aporadhider ortho jarimana:** The passage *mentions* a $1000 fine, so this is part of the bill, not something missing.
*   **D: Sohingso game er upore decal er aboshyikota:** The passage states games need an ""18"" seal, which is a type of labeling/decal, so this is included in the bill.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Ke boktobye bola kothagulo shunte parenni?","The correct answer is **C: Miller**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Montobyer jonno jigyasa koraa hole, miller bollen, """"""""shunani chalakalin somei mike onek kotha bole... Aami prostuto hachchilam taai seey kee bolche tha aami shunte pachchilam naa""""""""."" This directly translates to: ""When asked about Montobyer, Miller said, """"""""I didn't hear, Mike was speaking a lot during the journey... I was sleepy, that's why I couldn't hear what he was saying.""""""

Therefore, Miller couldn't hear what Mike was saying.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, nicher konti shunanite miller er obhiggotar satyo bornona day?","The correct answer is **B: Tini toiri hachhilen bole monojog dichhilen na** (He wasn't paying attention because he was prepared/ready).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Aami prostuto hachchilam taai seey kee bolche tha aami shunte pachchilam naa"" which directly translates to ""I was prepared, that's why I couldn't hear what he was saying."" This indicates Miller was *not* paying attention.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shunanir somoy Duval millerer upore ekti probhab phele** (During the hearing, Duval exerted some influence on Miller) - The passage doesn't mention Duval exerting any influence. It only talks about Miller not hearing.
* **C: Duval er dui santan shunanir somoy onek kotha bolchhilo** (Duval's two children spoke a lot during the hearing) - The passage mentions Duval having two children but *doesn't* say they spoke during the hearing.
* **D: Tini Duval r kothay gobhir monojog diyechhilen** (He was paying close attention to Duval's words) - This is the opposite of what the passage says; Miller explicitly states he wasn't listening.



"
K Mukto bauch aain er porimarjon korar poramorsho den?,"The correct answer is **D: Stiffen harper**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ditiyobar patther age prodhanmontri stiffen harper sarkar 'mukto bauch aain'key porjalochonar jonno sockle dolii sovar kachhe pathate somooto hechhen."" This directly translates to ""Before the second reading, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government was considering sending the 'Free Trade Act' to the House of Commons for review.""

Therefore, Stephen Harper is the one proposing the review of the ""Mukto bauch aain"" (Free Trade Act).



"
K oswikar koren je “mukto bauch aain” prak-nirbachoni lok dekhano procheshta hisebe byabohrito hoyni?,"The correct answer is **B: Ekjon Prodhnmontri (A Prime Minister)**.

This translates to ""Prime Minister John Howard said that this initiative was solely to prevent the Tasmanian government from incurring additional expenses of 45 million Australian dollars and facilities at the hospital being reduced.""

This directly indicates the Prime Minister *denies* the ""mukto bauch aain"" (free choice act) was used as pre-election publicity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rajya sarkarer kormokorta (State Government Official):** The text states the state government *criticized* it as a publicity stunt, meaning they *believe* it was used for that purpose.
*   **C: Ekjon NDP Neta (An NDP Leader):** The NDP leader is mentioned as being involved in a meeting, but doesn't deny the act being used for publicity.
*   **D: Ekjon federal neta (A federal leader):** While the Prime Minister is a federal leader, the text specifically names *John Howard* and his denial, making 'Prime Minister' the most precise answer.



"
Biaaler  mutre saniuric acid o melamine namok jougo duiti ke onner saathe bikriyar somoy ki gathon kore?,"The correct answer is **C: Crystal**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""বিশ্বরবিদ্যালয়ের গবেষকরা জানিয়েছেন, ২তি যৌগ একে অপরের সাথে বিক্রিয়া করে crystal গঠন করে যা kidney-র কার্যক্রমে বাধা দিতে পারে।"" (Researchers at the university have informed that 2 compounds react with each other to form crystals, which can hinder kidney function.)

The question asks what is *formed* when uric acid and melamine react. The passage clearly states they form **crystals**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kidney** - The kidney is *affected* by the crystals, not what is formed.
*   **B: Posha pranir khabar** - This refers to the animal feed and is where the compounds originated, not what they create when reacting.
*   **D: abolohito bornalibikkhon jontr** - This is the instrument (FTIR) used for comparison, not what is formed during the reaction.



"

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gobeshokra porjobekkhon korey dekhechilen biaaler mutre gothito crystal melamine ebong saniuric acid niye gothito. Ei sphotikgulir gathon akranto palito poshugulir mutra thekey paoagulir saathe mille jaa jokhon abolohito bornalibikkhon jontrer ( ftir ) dwara tulonay koraa hoy.""  This directly translates to: ""The researchers observed that the crystals in the urine were composed of melamine and uric acid. The structure of these crystals was matched with those found in the urine of control animals when compared using infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).""

Therefore, the researchers used the FTIR instrument to **examine the structure of the crystals found in the animal urine**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kidney er kriyakolap** (Kidney function) - While the crystals *affect* kidney function, the FTIR wasn't used to *measure* kidney function directly.
*   **C: Akranto posha prani** (Control animals) - They compared the crystal structure *to* control animals, but didn't observe the control animals themselves with the FTIR.
*   **D: Posha pranir bishakto khabar** (Contaminated feed of the animals) -  The feed caused the problem, but the FTIR was used on the urine, not the feed.



"
K lunak “chunnter runny ” bole ullekh koren?,"The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The text states: ""tommy dreamer bolechilen, """"""""luna chunnter prothom runny chhilen. amar prothom porichalok."""""" This directly translates to ""Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first runner in Chunnter. My first director.'""

Therefore, Tommy Dreamer is the one who refers to Luna as ""Chunnter's runner"".



"

The text states: ""dustin """"""""goldast"""""""" runnels montobbo korechilen je """"""""luna chhilo amar motoi khamkheali... hoyto baa aro beshi..."". This directly translates to ""Dustin 'Goldast' Runnels remembered that 'Luna was as reckless as me... maybe even more...'"". 

Therefore, Dustin Runnels is the one who uses the word ""khamkheali"" (reckless) to describe Luna.



"
Garhi dughotonar sathe jorhito ger chaloker ki hoyechhilo?,"The correct answer is **A: Tini mathay chote peyechhilen** (He/She received a minor head injury).

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states: ""Tobe, ger chaloker matha marattok chote legeche."" (However, the driver's head was slightly injured.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Se barhir bhetore thaka kono lokke aghat koreni** (He/She did not injure anyone inside the car) - The passage says someone *was* injured (""taader modhye keu aghat panni"").
* **C: Tak kembridger haspata theke Great Yarmouth-er ekti haspatale sthanantor kora hoy** (He/She was transferred from Cambridge Hospital to a hospital in Great Yarmouth) - The passage states the opposite - transferred *to* Cambridge.
* **D: Joruri porisheba take tar garhi theke ber korte sahajyo kore** (Emergency services helped him/her get out of the car) - While likely true, this isn't a *direct* statement of what *happened* to the driver, but rather how they were assisted.



"
Nicher konti rugby turnamenter  er somoy dakkhin africa er khelake byatikromi kore tole na?,"The correct answer is **C: Tournament shurute shanito performance**.

Here's why:

The passage states that South Africa started the tournament ""ekodom thikbhabe"" (very well) and easily defeated Zambia 26-0.  It then mentions they *improved consistently* as the tournament progressed. This implies their initial performance, while good, wasn't the factor that made them stand out – their *improvement* and the skills listed in the other options (powerful attack, ball control, strong defense) were.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: durdanto doloboddhota (powerful attack):** The passage *specifically* highlights their powerful attack as a key factor.
*   **B: Ball ball niyantran korar khomota (ability to control the ball):**  This is also explicitly mentioned as a strength.
*   **D: Rokkhonatmok koushal (defensive skills):** The passage states they had ""shringkholaboddho protirokkha"" (strong defense).



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, dakkhin africar khela kokhon bhalo hote shuru kore?","The correct answer is **D: Tournament cholakale** (As the tournament progressed).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""tournament egie jaoar saathe saathe dharabahikbhabe unnoti koreche"" which translates to ""As the tournament progressed, they consistently improved.""  This indicates their game started getting *good* as the tournament went on.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pray sokal 10:00 tay** (At 10:00 AM) - The game started at 10:00 AM, but the passage doesn't say their *play* was good then, just that the game began.
* **B: Rokkhon drirho korar por** (After strengthening their defense) - The passage mentions strong defense, but doesn't link it to when their game improved.
* **C: Jambiva-r kachhe harar por** (After losing to Jambiva) - They *won* against Jambiva, not lost.

"Onucchhed onujaayi, Nicher kon bornonati cheaner orthoniti protipholito kore na?","The correct answer is **D: Chean kokhonoi germanyr cheye beshi gaee roptani koreni**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Gotobochor chean germanyr thekey beshi gaee roptani korechilo"" (Recently, China exported more cars than Germany). This directly contradicts option D, which says China *never* exported more cars than Germany.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: Sanskarer por theke Cheaner orthoniti oti drutogotite briddhi peyechhe** (After the reforms, China's economy grew very rapidly) - The passage states ""Tokhon thekey cheener arthaniti 90 goon booa"" (Since then, China's economy has grown 90 times), supporting rapid growth.
*   **B: Cheaner markin juktorashtrer cheyeo boro gaee roptani bajar royechhe** (China has a larger car export market than the United States) - The passage says China ""atikranta korechilo"" (surpassed) the US as the largest car market.
*   **C: Chean dheere dheeremarkin juktorashtrer cheyeo borho GDP labh korte parto** (China could gradually achieve a higher GDP than the United States) - The passage states ""Dui doshoker modhye cheener gdp americar cheye beshi hote parto"" (Within two decades, China's GDP could exceed America's).



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Cheaner orthoniti markin juktorashtrer orthonitik kobe atikranta korte parto?","The correct answer is **B: Dui doshoker modhye** (Within two decades).

The passage states: ""Dui doshoker modhye cheener gdp americar cheye beshi hote parto"" which translates to ""Within two decades, China's GDP could surpass America's.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aro orthonoitik sanskar onusoron kore** (By implementing further economic reforms) - While reforms are important, the passage specifies a *timeframe*, not a condition.
*   **C: Jokhon desh notun netritwer aotay thake** (When the country has new leadership) - The passage mentions Deng Xiaoping's leadership initiating reforms, but doesn't tie the surpassing of the US economy to new leadership specifically.
*   **D: Tinn doshoker modhye** (Within three decades) - The passage clearly states *two* decades, not three.



"
Hue unnahanshil deshgulike ki korar poramorsho diyechhilen?,"The correct answer is **D: Dushoner purono karjokromgulike parihar koraa** (To address/rectify old programs of pollution).

Here's why:

The text states: """"Hue unnahanshil deshgulike anuprerana dikechilo, """"""""prothome dushoner purono karjokromgulike parihar koraa ebong tarpore porishkar koraa."""""""""""" (Hue inspired the developing countries, """"""first to rectify old pollution programs and then to clean up."""""""" )

This directly translates to Hue advising them to first fix their existing pollution programs. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Emon badhyobadhokotaguli grohon kora ja tader obosthake samner dike niye jabe** - (Accepting such obligations that will bring them forward) - The text mentions avoiding obligations that hinder development, not embracing them.
*   **B: Orthonoitik pholapholer proti gurutwo arop** - (Emphasizing economic prosperity) - While economic considerations were mentioned, it wasn't the *advice* given to developing nations.
*   **C: Tader bortoman dayittoke chharhiye jawa** - (Leaving their current responsibilities) -  Hue actually wanted them to fulfill responsibilities within reasonable limits, not abandon them.



"
Hue  ki ullekh korenni?,"The correct answer is **C: Emon ekti tarikh jokhon carbon nissworon hras pabe bole asha kora jay** (A date by which carbon emissions will be reduced).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tini ei komanor jonno kono poriman sthapon korenni, bolechilen jegulichiner orthonoitik er vittite toiri koraa hobey."" (He didn't establish any quantity for this reduction, saying that economic feasibility for each country should be considered.) 

This directly means Hue did *not* set a specific date or target for when carbon emissions should be reduced.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hraser mul vitti** (The root cause of reduction) - The text doesn't discuss the root cause, only the *how* of reduction (economic feasibility).
*   **B: Dushon somporke unnahanshil deshgulir jonyo poramorsho** (Advice for developing countries regarding pollution) -  The text *does* mention inspiring developing countries to first address old programs and then clean up (""Hue unnahanshil deshgulike anuprerana dikechilo, prothome dushoner purono karjokromgulike parihar koraa ebong tarpore porishkar koraa"").
*   **D: Carbon nirgomon hraser jonyo ekti songkhya** (A number for carbon emission reduction) -  The text explicitly states he didn't set a quantity (""ei komanor jonno kono poriman sthapon korenni"").



"
Nicher kontir karone bhirmyan poristhiti bhalo nei bole ullekh korechhilen?,"The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""angola ekhon sobche kharap durjoger dike choleche ebong angler poristhiti khubi kharap."" (Angola is now heading towards the worst disaster and the situation in Angola is very bad.)

Richardo Bhirmyan (of Medecins Sans Frontiver) is reported as saying this *about* Angola. Therefore, he mentioned the bad situation due to Angola's condition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Medecins sans frontiver:** This is the *organization* Bhirmyan represents, not the reason he cites for the poor situation.
*   **C: Mangola:** This is a medical charity mentioned at the beginning but not the reason for the bad situation.
*   **D: Biswa swastho sanstha:**  This is the World Health Organization, also mentioned initially, but not the reason for the poor situation.



"
"Prosecution er karone, Huhone er cabinet obosthan ke grohon korbe?","The correct answer is **C: Lamb**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Protyasha koraa hachche norman lamb mp banijya montrir pod grahan korben jeti devi chhei dichchen."" This translates to ""It is expected that Norman Lamb MP will take over the commerce ministry position that Devi has left."" 

Therefore, Lamb is expected to take over the cabinet position previously held by Devi.



"
Prosecution er phole ke banijya montrir bhumika grohon korbe?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Protyasha koraa hachche norman lamb mp banijya montrir pod grahan korben jeti devi chhei dichchen."" This translates to ""It is expected that Norman Lamb MP will take on the role of Commerce Minister which Devi has left.""

Therefore, Lamb is the one expected to take on the role."
camille cent-sense’ operar somoy shilpira dorshokder ki korte utsahito koren?,"The correct answer is **C: Moncher poribeshonay shilpider sathe jog dite** (To participate with the artist in the atmosphere of the stage).

Here's why:

The passage states the artist ""ekkhetre theatre nijei dorshokder jog ditey utsahito korey"" - which directly translates to ""encouraged the audience to participate within the theatre itself."" This aligns perfectly with option C, suggesting the artist wanted the audience to be part of the stage's ambiance and experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Madok shebone ongsho nite** (To take part in drug use) - While the passage mentions drug use by the artist, it doesn't say he encouraged the *audience* to partake.
*   **B: Japan bhromone jete** (To travel to Japan) - Japan is mentioned as a place where drugs were available, but has no relevance to what the artist asked the audience to do.
*   **D: Tader jibonke tara jaabhalobashe tar modhyo diye egiye nite** (To move forward through what they love in their lives) - This is a philosophical interpretation and not directly stated or implied in the passage.



"
Operar somoy prothome kara dhumpan kore?,"The correct answer is **C: Shilpira**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Falaswarup, **shilpira** monche madok joint niye dhumpan korey ebong ekkhetre theatre nijei dorshokder jog ditey utsahito korey.""  This directly translates to ""In reality, **the artist** smokes a drug joint and tries to encourage the audience to join in within the theater itself.""

Therefore, the artist is the one who smokes first.



"
Leonov-er somponno “mahakash podocharona”r arekti nam ki?,"The correct answer is **C: Mohakashjaner bairer karjokrom**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""1965 saaler 18 marche Tini prothom mohakashjaner bere mohakashe karjokrom (eva), baa """"""""mahakash podocharona"""""""" korey dekhan, barro minuter kichhu beshi somoy dhorey ekaki mohakashjaner bere thaken.""  This translates to: ""On March 18, 1965, he first performed a spacewalk (EVA), or """"""""space walk"""""""" and spent a little over 12 minutes alone outside the spacecraft.""  Therefore, ""mahakash podocharona"" is described *as* ""mohakashjaner bairer karjokrom"" (spacewalk/going outside the spacecraft).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Apollo-soyuj mission:** This was a mission Leonov *led* much later, it wasn't another name for his first spacewalk.
* **B: Space Race:** This is a broader historical context, not a specific name for his activity.
* **D: Mohakashchari No: 11:** This is unrelated to his spacewalk.



"
Lenov kon missione soviet ongsher netritto den?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-soyuj**.

The text specifically states: ""Dash bochor pore, Tini apollo-soyuj missioner soviet ongsher netritto diyechilen..."" (Ten years later, he led the Soviet part of the Apollo-Soyuz mission...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Space Race:** While Leonov was *part* of the Space Race, he didn't *lead* a mission called ""Space Race."" It's a general term for the competition.
*   **C: Mahakashchari No: 11:** This refers to his flight number, not a mission he led.
*   **D: EVA:** He was the first to perform an EVA (spacewalk), but he didn't *lead* a mission named EVA.



"
Garhi durghatonay ke aghat peyechhilo?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibson**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Durghotonar pore, gibsonke ekti hospital sthanantorito koraa hoyechilo, tobe kichukkhan porei seey maaraa gichechilo."" This translates to ""After the accident, Gibson was moved to a hospital, but died shortly after."" 

Therefore, Gibson is the one who was injured and ultimately died in the car accident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ekjon gyaraj kormi (A road worker):** The road worker *witnessed* the accident, they weren't injured by it.
* **C: Shishura (Children):** The children were present and scared, but the text doesn't say they were *injured*.
* **D: Ekjon track driver (A truck driver):** The track driver was the one *driving* the truck that was involved in the accident, but the text doesn't state if he was hurt. It just says he was 64 years old and at the scene.



"
Durghotonar sathe jorhito lokder ki hoyechhilo?,"The correct answer is **A: Duijon e maaraa jan** (Two people died).

Here's why:

* The text states ""Durghotonar pore, gibsonke ekti hospital sthanantorito koraa hoyechilo, tobe kichukkhan porei seey maaraa gichechilo."" (After the accident, Gibson was taken to a hospital, but died shortly after.)
* It also mentions ""Track driver, jaar bosock 64, durghotona okkhoto chhilo."" (The track driver, age 64, was injured in the accident.) but later says he died as well.
* While the quote describes people screaming and crying (""Tara chitkar korchhilen o kandchhilen""), this describes their *reaction* to the accident, not what *happened* to them directly.
* The text doesn't state that two people were injured (""Duijoni aghat peyechhilen""). It states one was injured *and* died, and the other died shortly after being hospitalized.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that two people died as a result of the accident.



"
Kormosuchiti niye kormoroto bigyanira kisher dwara srishto probhab porjobekkhoner protyasha korchhilen?,"The correct answer is **D: Dark matter**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the scientist believed, just as ordinary matter affects another ordinary matter, **dark matter affects another dark matter**. This is the core of the expected effect related to the work schedule (kormosuchiti). The passage specifically mentions the interaction between dark matter as analogous to the tidal forces (jowar-bhatar ball) exerted by the moon on Earth. However, the *mechanism* of influence the scientist was investigating *was* dark matter affecting dark matter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sadharan podartho (Ordinary matter):** While mentioned as an analogy, it's not the *focus* of the scientist's hypothesis about the work schedule.
*   **B: Jowar-bhatar ball (Tidal forces):** This is used as an *example* to illustrate the concept of gravitational influence, but not what the scientist expected to observe with the work schedule.
*   **C: Khudro kona (Small angles):** This describes the structure *resulting from* the dark matter interaction, not the driving force behind it.



"
Bigyanira nicher kontir podartho porjobekkhon korchhilen?,"The correct answer is **D: Sagitarius chhapoth ebong Akashganga** (Sagittarius dwarf galaxy and Milky Way).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the research was focused on mimicking the observations of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy's influence on the Milky Way. It describes how the scientist was trying to understand the effect Sagittarius has on the Milky Way's dark matter distribution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Akashganga ebong chand (Milky Way and Moon):** While the moon is used as an analogy, the *research* isn't directly about the moon.
*   **B: Prithibi ebong sagitarius chhapoth (Earth and Sagittarius dwarf galaxy):** The Earth isn't a central focus of the scientific investigation described.
*   **C: Prithibi ebong chand (Earth and Moon):** Similar to option A, Earth and the Moon are used for an analogy, not the main study.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, rakkhanshilra kontir samalochana korenni?","The correct answer is **D: Punornirmaner khoroch** (The cost of reconstruction).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ei bitorkoti hariken catariner somoy tran oo punornirmaner upor byayake kendra korey beshi chhoriyechilo; jetake kichhu ortho sangshlishto rakkhanshilra hasyokorbhabe """"""""busher new orleans chukti"""""""" bole abohito korechilo."" This translates to: ""This controversy during Hurricane Katrina focused heavily on spending on rail and reconstruction; which some conservative groups mockingly called the """"""""Busher New Orleans deal"""""""".""

This clearly indicates that the conservatives criticized the *cost* of reconstruction (punornirmaner khoroch).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Traner byay** (Rail spending) - While rail spending was *part* of the issue, the criticism was broader, encompassing reconstruction spending overall.
*   **B: Punornirman khorocher obhab** (Lack of reconstruction cost) - The passage implies the opposite - there was too much spending.
*   **C: Jader punornirmaner chukti dewa hoyechhilo** (Those who were given reconstruction contracts) - The passage doesn't mention criticism of *who* received contracts, only how much was being spent.



"
Kara hariken catariner’r tran karjer punornirman chukti niye samalochana korchhen?,"The correct answer is **D: Washington insiders**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Punornirmaner chesta somporke udhar samalochana **washington abhyantarinder** punarnirman chuktiguli onudhaboner dike lakkhyasthir koreche.""  This directly translates to ""Criticism regarding the reconstruction efforts has been directed by **Washington insiders** towards the reconstruction agreements.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ortho sangshlishto rakkhanshilra** - While mentioned in the text, they are the *target* of the criticism, not the ones *doing* the criticizing. They were the ones mocked with the ""Busher New Orleans chukti"".
*   **B: Udarponthira** - Not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Bush** - Not directly mentioned as the criticizer, although the phrase ""Busher New Orleans chukti"" implies a connection to the Bush administration, it doesn't indicate *they* are the ones lodging the criticism.

"Onucchhed onujaayi, Stardust mahakashjaner alo prothom kothay drishyoman hoy?","The correct answer is **B: Uttor california**.

The passage states: ""Vore 5tur (prachyer somoy) dike capsulty jokhon prithibir bamundale probesh korey, tokhon **uttor california**, oregon, nevada ebong utah anchaler basindara besh alor rashmi dekhte paan."" (When the capsule enters the Earth's atmosphere at 5 o'clock, residents of **Northern California**, Oregon, Nevada and Utah will see a bright flash of light.)

While the light will also be visible in other locations, the passage specifically mentions Northern California as the first place it will be seen.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, mahakashjanti nicher kontir jonyo ekti record srishti korbe?","The correct answer is **C: Prithibite sobcheye druto gotite phire asa (Returning to Earth at the fastest speed ever)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""1969 saaler mee masse apollo ex command modiuler fire aasaar recordti venge drutotomo mahakashjan hisabe stardust prithibite prottabortoner jonno sorbokaler ekti notun record srishti korbe."" This translates to: ""Stardust will create a new record for all time as the fastest spacecraft to return to Earth, breaking the record of the Apollo 11 command module's fiery return in 1969.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Akasher bistrito seema alokito kora (Illuminating a vast expanse of the sky):** While the capsule *will* illuminate the sky, the passage focuses on its *speed* of return, not the extent of the illumination.
*   **B: Odhikangsho nogore drishyoman howa (Being visible from many cities):** The passage mentions it will be seen in specific areas (Northern California, Oregon, Nevada, Utah), but doesn't say it will be visible from *many* cities generally.
*   **D: San Francisco theke Los Angeles-e sobcheye druto gotite bhromon kora (Traveling from San Francisco to Los Angeles at the fastest speed):** The passage mentions this speed as an example of how fast it's going, but the primary record is about the *return to Earth*.



"
Dr. maller balasubramanin kibhabe saroja balasubraman-er sathe somporkito chhilen?,"The correct answer is **C: Ma**.

The text states: ""29 bochor bosiie doh maller balasubramaninke, ... taaraa rokter daag bhora, kombole moaa 53 bochor bosiie saroja balasubramaniner mordeho peyechilo."" This translates to ""29-year-old Dr. Maller Balasubramani, ... found the body of 53-year-old Saroja Balasubramani covered in blood.""

The use of ""mordeho"" (body) and the context strongly suggests that Saroja Balasubramani was Dr. Maller Balasubramani's mother. Therefore, the relationship is mother (Ma).



"
Saroja balasubramanin-er mordeho kothay pawa giyechhilo?,"The correct answer is **C: Garhir trunk-e** (In the car's trunk).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tini tar adhikarikder 500 foot dure danano oldsmobile intriguer dike nirdesh corlen. Sekhane taaraa rokter daag bhora, kombole moaa 53 bochor bosiie saroja balasubramaniner mordeho peyechilo.""  This translates to: ""She directed officials 500 feet to a navy blue Oldsmobile Intrigue. There they found the body of 53-year-old Saroja Balasubramani, covered in bloodstains, in the trunk.""



"
ibey konti orjon korechhilo?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states ""Companity aasha korche je companity tar munafar utso bahumukhi korbe ebong chean,purbo europe oo brajiler moto jesob jaygay skype ekti shaktishali abosthane achhe sesab jaygay janapriyata orjon korbe.""  This directly refers to Skype gaining popularity in new markets.

The question (Q) asks ""ibey konti orjon korechhilo?"" (What did *it* achieve?). ""It"" refers back to the subject of the first sentence, which is Skype.



"
ibey ei orjon diye aro ki ki orjon korte chay?,"The correct answer is **B: Notun notun onchole somprosaron (Expansion into new areas)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states the company hopes to diversify its revenue sources and gain popularity in places like Eastern Europe and Brazil, where Skype already has a strong presence. This directly indicates a desire to *expand into new areas*.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Er ay mojbut kora (Strengthening its income):** While diversifying revenue *will* strengthen income, the passage focuses on *where* the income will come from, not just strengthening what they already have.
*   **C: Er profile unnoto kora (Improving its profile):** This is a byproduct of expansion and success, but not the primary goal stated in the passage.
*   **D: Er shareholder der sontushto kora (Satisfying its shareholders):** Satisfying shareholders is a general goal of any company, but the passage specifically mentions geographical expansion as the method to achieve growth and, ultimately, shareholder satisfaction.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, maramarir pore kara prangone theke jawa bandider sathe kotha bolenni?","The correct answer is **C: Kormokortara**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shighroi danga saranjam nie **kormokortara** chottore probesh corlen ebong bandiderkekadani gas die konthasa corlen."" This translates to ""Immediately, the riot control team entered the courtyard and used tear gas on the prisoners."" 

This means the riot control team (kormokortara) were the ones who directly engaged with the prisoners *after* the riot began. The passage doesn't mention the investigator (Alapalochankarira), fire brigade (Agni uddharkari kormira) or hospital staff (Haspataler kormira) speaking to the prisoners.



"
Konti bandider danga theke dheere dheere phire jete badhyo kore?,"The correct answer is **B: Kadani gas**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...*bandiderkekadani gas die konthasa corlen.*"" ( ""...the inmates were choked with tear gas."") This directly implies the tear gas forced the inmates to slowly retreat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sophol alapalochankarira (Successful negotiations):** The text says negotiations were *attempted* but were not successful (""*bondider dabigulo porishkar noy*"").
*   **C: Songi ahoto bandira (Accompanied inmates):** The text doesn't suggest any inmates helped others retreat.
*   **D: Agun (Fire):** While the fire was a factor, it was *after* the tear gas was used. The tear gas initiated the retreat.



"
"Atollah ally khamenei’r mote, Iran deshtir nijeke ki theke mukto korte hobe?","The correct answer is **D: Teler oppor nirbhorshilota (Dependence on oil)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Deshtir sheersho neta, atollah ally khamenei, teler oppor nirbhorshilotake bornona korechen """"""""ek faand"""""""" hisebe jaa 1979 saaler islamic bidroher purbe jaa ebong jaar thekey deshke mukter projana.""  This translates to: ""The country's top leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has described dependence on oil as a 'trap' as before the 1979 Islamic Revolution and from which the country needs to be freed.""

Therefore, according to Khamenei, Iran needs to free itself from dependence on oil.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Ke iraner orthoneetir upore nishedhaggar prabhab sweekar korechhilen?","The correct answer is **A: Urdhoton sutrogulo** (The elevated sources/leadership).

The passage states: ""Televisione sarasari ei montobbo korar maane holo **prothombarer moto iraner urdhoton sutrogulo** sweekar koreche je ei nishedhaggagulor kono prabhab royeche."" 

This translates to: ""Television reports mean that **Iran's top leadership** has acknowledged that these sanctions have had some effect.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Opec:** OPEC reported on oil production, they didn't *acknowledge* the effect of sanctions.
* **C: Atollah ally khamenei:** He dismissed oil dependence *as* a ""fraud,"" not acknowledged the sanctions' impact.
* **D: Europea union:** The European Union *imposed* the sanctions, they weren't acknowledging their effect on Iran.



"
Nicher konti France’er bhotdan prokriyar ongsho noy?,"The correct answer is **D: Prarthider protinidhider gonona kora bhote** (Counting the representatives of candidates in the polling booth).

Here's why:

*   **A: Swachcho ronger voting box** (Clean colored voting box) - The passage explicitly states ballot boxes must be transparent since 1988 to ensure fairness.
*   **B: Prarthider pathano protinidhi** (Representatives sent by candidates) - The passage states candidates can send representatives to oversee the process.
*   **C: bhoter talikay swakkhor kora** (Signing the voter list) - The passage mentions voters sign the voting list after verifying their identity.
*   **D: Prarthider protinidhider gonona kora bhote** (Counting the representatives of candidates in the polling booth) - The passage mentions representatives *observe* the process, but there's no mention of counting them. The *votes* are counted by volunteers under strict supervision.

Therefore, option D is not a part of the French voting process as described in the text."
Bhoter ra tader pochhonder prarthike kothay nirdesh korbe?,"The correct answer is **B: Age thekey chhapano ekti kagoje**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...age thekey chhapano ekti kagoje taader pochonder prarthike chinnito korey ekti khaame rakhe."" This directly translates to ""voters mark their preferred candidate on a pre-printed paper and place it in a box.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Voter talikay (Voter list):** The voter list is used for identification, not marking preferences.
*   **C: Ekti khaame (A box):** The box is where the ballot *goes*, not where the preference is *marked*.
*   **D: Ekti boother modhye thaka machine a (A machine inside the booth):** The passage doesn't mention any machine being used for marking preferences; it specifically describes paper ballots.



"
Ki allen ke mushasir jonno at-bochhorer tallasi shuru korte tarito korechhilo?,"The correct answer is **D: Tar juddher proti agroho** (His aversion to war).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...juddher proti ajibon lalit agroho thekey musashike khunje petey tar sandhan shuru korechilen bole jaanaa geche.""  This directly translates to ""It is known that he started his search for Musashi driven by his lifelong aversion to war.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tar sompod (His wealth):** While he *used* his wealth for the search, it wasn't the *reason* he started it.
* **B: Samudra tolodesher mapping er proti tar agroho (His interest in mapping the seafloor):** The mapping was a *tool* used in the search, not the motivating factor.
* **C: Samudrik gobeshonay tar biniyog (His investment in marine research):**  Similar to wealth, this was a means to an end, not the initial cause.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, allen tar ullekhjogyo poriman ortho kisher jonyo byay koren?","The correct answer is **B: Samudrik onusondhan (Marine research)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""allen samudrik onusondhane tar beshirbhag sompod biniyog korechen"" which translates to ""Allen has invested a large part of his wealth in marine research.""  

While he *ultimately* wants to find the Musashi (A), his primary expenditure is on the broader field of marine research, which then enables the search for the Musashi. The other options are either tools *used within* marine research (ROV - C) or a specific part of the process (mapping - D), but not the overall area of spending.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, nicher kontir phole plant tir modhye ba charpashe bipojjonok obostha srishti hote pare?","The correct answer is **A: Uranism jalani**.

Here's why:

The passage states the local authorities suspect the fuel rods containing uranium might have melted and leaked (""*anuman dwara etai bojha jachche seii sthole uranism jalani thaka patroguli hoyto venge gikeche ebong futo toiri hoyeche*"").  This leakage of uranium fuel is the most direct and significant hazardous condition described.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Tejaskri cgm:** While তেজস্ক্রিয় CGM (radioactive CGM) is *detected* at the plant, the passage doesn't say it *creates* the hazardous condition. It's a result of something else happening.
*   **C: Sada dhoa:**  ""Sada dhoa"" (white smoke) is *observed*, but the passage doesn’t indicate it *causes* a dangerous situation. It's a symptom.
*   **D: Aodin:** Aodin (iodine) is also detected, similar to CGM, it's a consequence, not the primary hazard.



"

Here's why:

The passage states the local authorities are *closing* (not repairing) the cooling control systems to prevent people from entering buildings. The other options are all mentioned as safety measures given to residents:

* **B: Baadir vitore thaka** (Staying indoors) - explicitly stated.
* **C: Sada dhoate swash newa theke biroto thaka** (Avoiding taking deep breaths) - the passage says ""sada dhoya aste dekha jaa"" (seen to be constantly washing) suggesting avoiding inhaling particles.
* **D: Noler joll naa khaoa** (Not eating saltwater fish) - explicitly stated.

Therefore, repairing the cooling unit is the one action *not* listed as a safety precaution.

"Dr. mole-er mote, xdr-tb-r byapare sobcheye udwegjonok bishoyti ki?","The correct answer is **D: Er uchcho mrityu har** (Its high mortality rate).

Here's why:

The passage directly quotes Dr. Mole saying the new situation is ""atyanta udwegjonok ebong bhitikar"" (extremely worrying and frightening) *because* of the ""uchcho mrityur haar"" (high mortality rate).  This is the primary concern he expresses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Variant ti hospitaler sangsparshe eshechhe** (The variant has come into contact in the hospital) - While this is a concern, it's a *result* of the problem, not the most worrying aspect itself.
*   **B: Variant tir oshudh protirodh khomota** (The variant's drug resistance ability) -  The passage *states* it's XDR-TB (extensively drug-resistant TB), so drug resistance is inherent, but Dr. Mole emphasizes the *outcome* of that resistance - the high death rate.
*   **C: Akranto byakti jotojon lok ke sangkramito korte paren** (How many people an infected person can infect) - The passage mentions this (10-15 people), but it's presented as a factor contributing to the spread, not the most alarming part.



"
Jotojon rogider variant tir sangsporshe eshechhilen tader modhye kotojon nishchitobhabe swasthoseba kormi?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The passage states: ""Dah mole money korchen hospitaler rogider modhye jara poka sangkramito hechhen taader modhye ontoto due'jon hospital karmi."" This translates to ""Dr. Mole found that among the infected patients in the hospital, at least two were healthcare workers.""
"
Nextgen system kon prajukti byabohar kore?,"The correct answer is **A: Satellite vittik prajukti**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Eti bimaner traffic niyantrankarider aro beshi nirbhul bhabe biman nirdharan korar jonno ebong pailotder aro beshi sothik tothyo pathanor jonno purano ground-rudder-vittik prajuktir poriborte **satellite vittik prajukti** byabohar korey."" (It uses **satellite-based technology** instead of the old ground-radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to identify planes more accurately and send more accurate information to pilots.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Shukkho projukti** - This doesn't relate to the text.
*   **C: Ground-rudder-vittik prajukti** - The text specifically states Nextgen *replaces* this technology.
*   **D: Carbon nissworon projukti** - While Nextgen *helps* reduce carbon emissions, it doesn't *use* carbon emission technology. It uses satellite technology to achieve this.



"
Nextgen kibhabe sorasori air traffic controller ke subidha dey?,"The correct answer is **B: Bimane obosthan aro nirbhul kore** (Makes aircraft location more accurate).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nextgen...satellite vittik prajukti byabohar korey...biman traffic niyantrankarider aro beshi nirbhul bhabe biman nirdharan korar jonno"" - which directly translates to ""...uses satellite technology...to allow air traffic controllers to determine the location of aircraft more accurately.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Akash path songkhipto kore** (Shortens air routes) - While Nextgen *aims* to shorten routes, the passage doesn't specifically say it *directly* does so for air traffic controllers. It's a benefit, but not the direct assistance.
* **C: Carbon nisshoron hras kore** (Reduces carbon emissions) - This is a *result* of Nextgen, but not how it directly helps controllers.
* **D: Kom jwalani** (Less fuel consumption) - Similar to C, this is a consequence of Nextgen, not a direct benefit to controllers.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Itihasbidra kontite gurutwo aroper jonyo fbi-er samalochona korenni?","The correct answer is **B: Sohoje somadhanjogyo oporadher jonyo resource motayen kora** (Spending resources on easily solvable crimes).

Here's why:

The passage states Itihasbidra criticized the FBI for prioritizing cases that are easily solved (like cattle theft) *instead* of focusing on cases where more significant resources could be gained.  This is the core of the criticism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tader safalatar haar banano** (Making their success rate look good) - While implied, it's a *result* of the resource allocation, not the criticism itself.
* **C: Pornography case er upore odhik gurutwo arop kora** (Giving more importance to pornography cases) - The passage mentions pornography cases, but Itihasbidra isn't criticizing the FBI for focusing *too much* on them; they're criticizing the overall allocation of resources.  Congress mandated resources *for* pornography cases.
* **D: Gaee churir mamla** (Cattle theft cases) - Cattle theft is used as an *example* of the types of easily solvable cases the FBI was prioritizing, not the focus of the criticism.



"
Ashleel uddoger bishoyti fbi-ke ki korte badhyo kore?,"The correct answer is **D: Pornography case a agent nijukto kora**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that Congress mandated the FBI to ""aboshyoi praptobyayoskoder pornography 10 jon agentder nijukto korte hobey"" (must appoint 10 agents to deal with pornography). This directly addresses what the FBI was obligated to do regarding the pornography industry.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gaee churir mamlay aro sompod boraddho kora** (Increase resources in cattle theft cases) - While mentioned in the text as a broader area of concern, it's not the *specific obligation* placed on the FBI regarding the pornography industry.
*   **B: Agency er safalatar haar banano** (To create a record of the agency's failures) - This is a criticism of the FBI's past performance, not a new duty assigned to it.
*   **C: Sahoje samadhan koraa jaa emon oporadhgulike gurutwo dewa** (To prioritize easily solvable crimes) - This is a general idea about addressing crime, not a specific directive related to pornography.



"
JAS 39 see -er durghotonay sahajyo korar jonyo nijukto agni nirbapok gaaritir ki hoyechhilo? ,"The correct answer is **B: Eti ulte jay** (It overturned).

The text specifically states: ""Sthaniya sangbad madhyam jaanaay, uddhare nijukto bimanbandar ekti agni nirbapok gaari kaajer somoy ulte geche."" which translates to ""Local media reports that at the rescue-appointed airport, a fire truck overturned while working.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Eti durghotonar sweekar hoy** (It was accepted as an accident) - While an accident *happened*, this isn't what happened *to the fire truck*.
*   **C: Eti bisphorito hoy** (It exploded) - The JAS 39 exploded, not the fire truck.
*   **D: Er gas shesh hoye jay** (Its gas ran out) - The text doesn't mention anything about the gas of the fire truck.



"
"JAS 39 see grippen durghotonar pore, bimanbondor ki bondho kore day?","The correct answer is **A: Banijyik flight**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...foley bimanbandarti banijyik flight bondho korey deyo."" which translates to ""...commercial flights at the airport were closed.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: agni nirbapok gaari (fire engine)** - The text mentions a fire engine overturned *during* the incident, but it didn't cause the airport to close.
*   **C: Sthaniya media (local media)** - Local media *reported* on the incident, they didn't close the airport.
*   **D: Squadron Leader** - The Squadron Leader was a pilot involved, not a reason for the airport closure.



"
Brojejinsky Irani biplober somoy kake nirdeshona diten?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...iran biplob, jaa iranke jimmy sangkater dike porichalito korey, 1979..."" This directly translates to ""...the Iranian revolution, which was directed by Jimmy Carter in Iran, 1979.""

Therefore, Brezezinski was assisting Carter in managing the Iranian Revolution.



"
1977 sal porjonto ke Jateeyo nirapatta upodeshta-r pod dhore rakhen?,"The correct answer is **A: Brojejinsky**.

The passage states: ""1977 thekey 1981 porjonto jateea nirapatta upodeshta hisabe ( nsa ) kaaj korechilen, henry kissinger er uttarsuri hisebe."" This means Brojejinsky succeeded Kissinger as the National Security Advisor and held the position from 1977 to 1981.

Partijan belgrader sathe bobic’er itihas somporke kon bornonati sothik?,"The correct answer is **A: Tini 1945 theke Partizan-er saathe khelte shuru koren.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Croatier rajdhani jagreb-ee jonmogrohon koraa bobic partijan belgrader jonno khele khyatilav koren. Tini 1945 khristabde taader saathe jog dene oo 1958 khristabda porjonto sekhane thaken."" (Bobić gained fame playing for Partizan Belgrade. He joined them in 1945 and stayed until 1958.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the passage mentions he was born in Zagreb, it doesn't say he played *for* a team in Zagreb before Partizan.
* **C:** The passage states he left Partizan in 1958, not that he continued playing for them until 1995.
* **D:** He was *elected* the best player in Partizan's history in 1995, but he gained fame *before* that, through his playing career.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, kon boishishtyo Hespernichus-ke velocyruptor theke prithok kore?","The correct answer is **B: dwitiya nakhti chhilo apekkhakrito boro** (its second claw was expected to be bigger).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Er dwitiya nakhti chhilo apekkhakrito boro, jaa hesperonicus namtir janma diyechilo..."" (Its second claw was expected to be bigger, which gave rise to the name Hesperonicus...). This is the distinguishing feature mentioned in relation to *Velociraptor*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Etir duiti pa aahhe** (It has two legs) - The passage mentions both Hespernichus and Velociraptor walked on two legs, so this isn't a distinguishing feature.
*   **C: Er shorir sompurno palokjukto** (Its body was completely feathered) - The passage says they *believed* it was fully feathered like Velociraptor, but doesn’t state it’s a unique characteristic of Hespernichus.
*   **D: Er rokto ushno** (Its blood was warm) - The passage states both are believed to be warm-blooded.



"
“Hespernichus” er ortho projatir kon sharirik boishishtyo theke newa hoyechhe?,"The correct answer is **A: Thaba**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Er dwitiya nakhti chhilo apekkhakrito boro, jaa hesperonicus namtir janma diyechilo jaar ortho """"""""poschima thaba.""""""""""""""  This directly translates to ""Its second tooth was unexpectedly large, which gave rise to the name *Hesperonicus* meaning """"""""western tooth.""""""""""""""

Therefore, the name ""Hespernichus"" and its meaning are derived from a physical characteristic - the tooth (""thaba"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Palokjukto shorir (Feathered body):** The passage mentions feathers, but doesn't say it's the basis for the name.
*   **C: Pa (Foot):** The passage mentions walking on two feet, but doesn't relate it to the name.
*   **D: Thont (Chin):**  There is no mention of the chin in relation to the name.



"
Shuting somporke nicher kon bakyoti satyo noy?,"The correct answer is **B: Panch jon ghotonar shikar hoyechhilo** (Five people were victims of the shooting).

Here's why:

*   The text states the shooting injured four people (""shutingye nihoto charjoner modhye ekjon""). It doesn't mention five victims.
*   Let's look at why the other options are true:
    *   **A: Ei Swami o stree duijon e texus theke eshechhilen** (Both the husband and wife came from Texas) - The text explicitly states they were married in Texas a year ago.
    *   **C: Ei dampati ek bochor age Buffalote biye koren** (This couple got married in Buffalo a year ago) - The text states they were married a year ago and ""bafeloy esechilen"" (came to Buffalo).
    *   **D: Shuting ghotonati Bafelote ghote** (The shooting incident happened in Buffalo) - The context clearly indicates the shooting took place at the celebration in Buffalo.

Therefore, option B is the only statement that contradicts the information provided in the text."
Je event e shuting er ghotonati ghotechhilo seti somporke nicher kon bakyoti nirbhul?,"The correct answer is **B: Ekti procholito barshikir event e eti ghotechhilo** (It happened at a regular annual event).

Here's why:

* The text states ""ekt i procholito barshik anusthan poroborti kono tarikhe nirdharito hoyechilo"" which translates to ""a regular annual event had been scheduled on a subsequent date."" The shooting occurred *during* this event.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bufelote ekti party er somoy eti ghotechhilo** (It happened during a party in Buffalo) - While the event was *in* Buffalo, the text doesn't specifically say it was just a ""party."" It was a scheduled annual event.
* **C: Eti texuser ekti party te ghotechhilo** (It happened at a Texas party) - The couple got married in Texas, but the event where the shooting happened was in Buffalo.
* **D: Ei dampatir biyer somoy eti ghotechhilo** (It happened during the couple's wedding) -  The text clearly states they were celebrating their *first wedding anniversary* a year *after* the wedding.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Luno niye kormokortader prathomik ashanka ki chhilo?","The correct answer is **C: Jwalani chhorhiye porha** (Fuel leaking).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""prathomikbhabe kormokortara ashanka korechilo je jahajti thekey malgulo pore jete paare"" which translates to ""the workers initially suspected that the goods from the ship might fall off.""  ""Malgulo"" in this context refers to the fuel (jalani) that was initially mentioned as being 120-160 cubic meters.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ekti sarer cargo er obhab** (Lack of a cargo of goods) - The passage doesn't mention a lack of cargo, but a potential *loss* of cargo (fuel).
*   **B: Ddheu o oti batas** (Wave and strong current) - While the waves and current are mentioned, they aren't the workers' primary concern.
*   **D: Crew sodosyoder sombhabyo khoti** (Possible loss of crew members) - The passage states the helicopter rescued the crew, indicating they weren't initially worried about their loss.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Luno er venge porha somporke nicher kon bakyoti satyo noy?","The correct answer is **B: Venge porhar somoye jahajtite 100 mitter jalani chhilo.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states the ship had 120-160 cubic meters of fuel when Luno struck, *not* 100 meters.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

*   **A: Cargo tolar age vangar ghotonati ghotechhilo** - The passage says the ship was *going* to load cargo, implying the grounding happened *before* that.
*   **C: Baro jon crew sodosyer modhye, ekjon ahoto hon** - The passage mentions the helicopters rescued crew members and ""ekmatro aghat chhilo ekti bhanga naak"" (the only injury was a broken nose), implying at least one crew member was injured among the rescued.
*   **D: Jahajti torongo-rodhoker dike thele dewa hoyechhilo** - ""bishal beger batas ebong eker pore ek ddheu lunoke joler otole dubi deyi"" suggests the ship was driven towards the shore by the waves.



"

The text states: ""1960 er doshoke cholochchitro porichalona shekhanar jonno Tini soddo swadhin algeriate fire ashen."" This translates to ""In the 1960s, he returned to newly independent Algeria to direct films."" This directly indicates Algeria gained independence in the 1960s."
 Sheshkrityer anusthaner jonyo television er screen kothay set kora hoyni?,"The correct answer is **D: cent peters square e**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the large crowds *couldn't* fit into St. Peter's Square, which is why large television screens were set up in *other* places (various locations in Rome, Italian cities, and Polyand). This directly implies screens were *not* set up *in* St. Peter's Square itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Puro Rome jurhe:** The passage explicitly says screens were set up in *various places* in Rome.
*   **B: Bibhinno Italian nogore:** The passage states screens were set up in other Italian cities.
*   **C: Polyander nirdishto sthane:** The passage states screens were set up in specific locations in Polyand.



"
sheshkrityer anusthanti kothay onushthito hoyechhilo?,"The correct answer is **C: cent peters square e**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...je cent peters scoverey aojit sheshkrityer anusthan sokle eksathe probesh korey dekhte paini."" This directly translates to ""...the final ceremony held in St. Peter's Square could not accommodate all the people together.""

While the event was also viewed in other places (Rome, Polyande, other Italian cities), the *actual ceremony* took place in St. Peter's Square.



"
"Bishforoner pore, kake gurutoro aghater jonyo chikitsa dewa hoy?","The correct answer is **A: Kompokkhe panch jon lok ke** (Approximately five people).

Here's why:

The text states: ""bishforoner somoy seii sthane thaka kom korey panch joner modhye shocker lakkhan thakar jonno chikitsa koraa hoyechilo"" which translates to ""Among the approximately five people who were at the scene during the explosion, treatment was given for symptoms of shock.""

Therefore, approximately five people received medical treatment after the explosion.



"
Ke gas leak er report korechhilen?,"The correct answer is **A: Bhoboner ekjon protibeshi** (A neighbor of the building).

The text specifically states: ""Ekjon protibeshi gas leak howar kotha jananor porei..."" which translates to ""After a neighbor reported the gas leak..."" 

Therefore, a neighbor reported the gas leak."

The text states: ""Jaader pranhani hoyechilo taaraa hollen, nicolas olden, 25 bochor, ebong jackery chudback, 21 bochor."" This translates to: ""Those who died were Nicolas Olden, 25 years old, and Jackery Chudback, 21 years old.""

Therefore, two people died in the accident."
Akromoner somoy kar astro ekti porjaye guli korte byartho hoy?,"The correct answer is **B: Uka**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pancham bektir mathar dike taak korey thaka abostha ukaar astro byarthya hoyechilo."" (The fifth person's gaze towards the mother's side was futile.) This directly answers the question about who had a futile gaze. The fifth person is referred to as ""uka"" in this context.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cuddeback:** Was the driver, but there's no mention of his gaze being futile.
*   **C: Snider:** Suffered severe injuries and had reconstructive surgery, but the text doesn't say his gaze was futile.
*   **D: Alden:** Is only mentioned as one of the people involved, with no mention of his gaze.



"
Kon khelatike Olympyk program er baire vote dewa hoyechhilo?,"The correct answer is **C: Baseball**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Baseball and softball alongside squash, karate and roller sports tried to enter the Olympic programme which in 2005 voted the Olympic games out."" This clearly indicates that baseball (and softball) were voted *out* of the Olympic program in 2005.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Squash** - Squash *tried* to enter, but wasn't necessarily voted out specifically at that time.
*   **B: Rugby** - Rugby was *selected* as an Olympic sport, not voted out.
*   **D: Karate** - Karate *tried* to enter, but wasn't necessarily voted out specifically at that time."

The text states: ""1759 saaler 24 shhey september arthar ginnis arlander doubline cent jameser gate breury **9,000 bochorer bhadar jonno** swakkhar korechilen.""  This translates to ""On September 24, 1759, Arthur Guinness leased the brewery at St. James' Gate in Dublin **for 9,000 years**.""

Therefore, Arthur Guinness leased St James’ Gate Brewery for 9,000 years.
"
Ginnis proti bochhor koto bilion dolaar ay kore?,"The correct answer is **D: 10**.

The text states that Guinness (Ginnis) now makes 10 billion euros per year, which is equivalent to 14.7 billion US dollars. The question asks how many *billion* dollars Guinness makes per year, and the text directly gives us 10 billion euros (and its USD equivalent).

Therefore, the answer is 10."
European Union er koto gulii deshe H5N1 virus shonakto kora hoyechhe?,"The correct answer is **C: Sat**.

Here's why:

The passage states that after Austria, Germany, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Italy, France is the *seventh* European Union country to be affected by the virus. Therefore, a total of seven countries have been infected.



"
H5N1 viruser sorboshesh case ti kothay shonakto kora hoyechhe?,"The correct answer is **A: France**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ee Ashtriva, germany, sLobhnia, bulgerica, grease ebong italir pore france europee unifoner saptam desh jaa ei viruse akranto.""  This translates to ""After Austria, Germany, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Greece and Italy, France is the seventh European country infected with this virus.""

Therefore, France is mentioned as the most recent country where cases have been confirmed, making it the answer.



"
Shantirokkhider madhyome srishti hoye chhorhiye porar age Haiti sorboshesh kokhon ei rougher sommukhin hoyechhilo?,"The correct answer is **A: 1800 te**.

The passage states: ""Sainyader aasaar age, haiti 1800 doshok thekey ei roger sammukhin hoyney."" This translates to ""Before the arrival of the military, Haiti had been facing this disease since the 1800s."" 

Therefore, Haiti first faced this disease in the 1800s, before it was brought by the peacekeeping forces. Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sainyadol pounchhanor kichhudin agei** - The passage states the disease existed *long* before the soldiers arrived, not just a few days.
*   **C: Bhumikomper age** - The passage mentions the earthquake of 2010, but the disease's history goes back further.
*   **D: 2009 sale** -  There's no mention of 2009 in relation to the disease's initial appearance."
Kon sthaner borjyo ei rogti chhorhiye porhar jonyo dayi?,"The correct answer is **A: Artibonite nodee**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""foley haitir artibonite nadir onnotomo deergho shakhatite bacteria probesh korechilo"" which translates to ""bacteria entered the long branches of the Artibonite River in Haiti."" This indicates the river was the source/location where the disease spread from.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jatisongher ekti camp (A UN camp):** While the text suggests the UN peacekeeping forces *brought* the disease, it doesn't say the camp was where it originated or spread *from*.
*   **C: 2010 saler bhumikomper sthan (Location of the 2010 earthquake):** The earthquake is mentioned as context, but not as the source of the disease.
*   **D: Haitian Institute for Justice and Democracy:** This institute *investigated* the issue, they didn't spread the disease.



"
Iris sarkar ki korar porikolpona korchhe?,"The correct answer is **A: Madok oporadhider doshi sabyasto kora (Declaring drug offenders as guilty)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Swasthomontri...madok-sangkranta doshi ghoshito haoya ubhoyer khettre udweg prakash korechen."" - ""The Health Minister...has expressed concern regarding declaring those involved in drugs as guilty.""

This clearly indicates the Iris government is considering declaring individuals involved in drugs as guilty, which aligns with option A.  The passage mentions a need for legal framework to address public health and crime, and the Health Minister's concern about declaring drug offenders as guilty falls within that context.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Madok onumodoner bishoye aro kothor ain protishtha kora (Establishing stricter laws regarding drug approval):** The passage doesn't mention anything about *approving* drugs, only about dealing with *offenders*.
*   **C: Madok onumodon songkranto ain shithil kora (Relaxing laws related to drug approval):**  The passage suggests the opposite – a need for stronger legal frameworks.
*   **D: Madok ke oporadher aota theke mukto kora (Freeing drugs from the clutches of crime):**  The passage focuses on criminalizing offenders, not decriminalizing drugs themselves.



"
Ireland e samoyikbhabe ki boidho chhilo?,"The correct answer is **D: Madok**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Swasthomontri, bishgulite jita emon asthayi boidhotar sujog grohonkarider samriddhi ebong ekhonkar asangbidhanik parivartan howar pore **madok-sangkranta doshi ghoshito haoya** ubhoyer khettre udweg prakash korechen.""

This translates to: ""The Minister of Health expressed concern regarding the prosperity of those taking advantage of temporary legality in various countries and being declared guilty of **drug-related** offenses after the recent unconstitutional changes.""

Therefore, the text explicitly mentions that what was temporarily legal in Ireland (and other countries) was related to drugs (madok).



"
Sondehobhajon oporadhir bishoye ki niye todonto kora hochchhilo?,"The correct answer is **A: Anadhikarprabesh**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...sandehabhajan purush aporadhike **anadhikarprabeshkari hisebe todonto koraa hachche**..."" which translates to ""...the suspect is being charged as an **unauthorized entrant**..."".  This directly answers the question about what the charges relate to.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sharirik khoti (Physical harm):** The passage doesn't mention physical injury.
* **C: Dhwangshatmok kormokando (Destructive act):** While ""bhangchur jonno n."" is mentioned, the *charge* is for unauthorized entry.
* **D: Churi (Theft):** Theft isn't mentioned in the context of the charges.



"
"Chinno poribortoner somoy, sondehobhajon ki koreni?","The correct answer is **B: Etike ekti shanti chinno diye sojjito kora** (It was decorated with a peace symbol).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""shanty oo hridayer chinnoguli die sajjito kaalo tarpulinguli byabohar korey ei poribortonti koraa hoyechilo..."" This directly translates to ""...black tarpaulins decorated with peace symbols were used to make this change...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Er ekti borno poriborton kora** (A letter was changed) - The passage mentions changing ""e"" to ""o"" but that's *part of* how the symbol was created, not the main action during the changeover.
* **C: Etike sorasori noshto kora** (It was directly destroyed) - The passage implies alteration, not destruction.
* **D: Eti poriborton korte tarpulin byabohar kora** (Tarpaulin was used to make this change) -  While tarpaulin *was* used, it wasn't the action *done to* the symbol, it was the *material* used *for* decorating it.

* The passage explicitly states Corno was accused of using offensive language in her notes that parents found objectionable (""notgulite seey emon shobdo byabohar korechilo jaa kichhu abhibhaboker kachhe amarjito bole money hoyechilo"") and of using indecent language in class (""seey classe ashleel byabohar koreche bole jaanaa geche"").  A former student also directly stated she ""used bad words in class.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Copyright longhon (Copyright infringement)** - The passage mentions ""biggapon chhapano"" (publishing pamphlets) but specifically links it to *unapproved* content, not copyright.  The core issue isn't about ownership of the material, but its suitability.
* **B: Ekjon shikkharthir sathe prem kora (Having a relationship with a student)** - While the student describes a close bond (""chhilo chhatroder bandhur moto""), there's no direct accusation of a romantic relationship. The phrase ""chirkute premer dokkhota shikhieche"" (taught the pain of unrequited love) is figurative and doesn't imply a personal relationship.
* **C: Onanumodito biggapon mudron kora (Publishing unapproved pamphlets)** - This is mentioned, but it's a secondary issue. The main complaints revolve around the language and classroom conduct.

"Onucchhed onujaayi, Rolando Mendoza kake hostage koreni?","The correct answer is **A: Porjotokder (Tourists)**.

The passage clearly states: ""Phillipin-er ekjon praktan pulish phillipiner rajdhani manilla hongkongyer porjotokder bus hijack korey taader atok korey rekheche."" This translates to: ""A former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus of Hong Kong tourists in the Philippine capital Manila and held them hostage.""

Therefore, Rolando Mendoza took the **tourists** hostage."
"Onucchhedr bhittite, kon hostage der druto chharha hoyechhe bole nishchito kora hoyni?","The correct answer is **B: Boyoskoder** (Elderly people).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ফিলিপাইনের আলোকচিত্রকারীদের ছাড়া শিশু ও বৃদ্ধসহ কয়েকজন জিম্মিকে আগে মুক্তি দেওয়া হয়েছিল।"" (Besides the photographers, some hostages including children and the elderly were released earlier.)

This means children and the elderly were released *before* others. The question asks who *hasn't* been confirmed to be released quickly.  The passage doesn't mention tourists or photographers being prioritized for quick release - it specifically says the photographer took the place of an elderly woman needing to use the restroom.

Therefore, the elderly are the group whose quick release isn't definitively stated."
"Onucchhed onujaayi, brajile ke eki-linger bibaher somorthone swakkhor songgroho korchhe?","The correct answer is **A: Bikkhovkarira (Protestors)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bikkhovkarira navembar masse jatiya congresser hajir korar jonno 1.2 million swakkhorjukto ekti abedon sangraha korben bole aasha rakhchen."" This directly translates to ""Protestors are hoping to collect 1.2 million signatures to submit to the National Congress in November.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Roberto Jefferson:** He is currently holding the proposed amendment, but isn't collecting signatures.
*   **C: Roman Catholic Church:** The passage states they *oppose* same-sex marriage.
*   **D: Marta Suplicy:** She drafted the initial bill, but isn't currently collecting signatures.



"
Bikkhobkarira tader petition kar kachhe debe?,"The correct answer is **C: Braziler Jatiya Congress**.

Here's why:

The passage states the protestors aim to submit their 1.2 million signature petition to the **Braziler Jatiya Congress** in November. The petition is regarding the debate over legalizing same-sex marriage nationally.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Roman Catholic Church:** The passage states the Church *opposes* same-sex marriage, making it unlikely the protestors would submit a petition *to* them.
*   **B: Roberto Jefferson:** He currently *holds* the proposed amendment, but is not the body to whom the petition is addressed.
*   **D: São Paulo mayor:** São Paulo is the only place where same-sex marriage is currently legal, and the petition is for *national* legalization, and it doesn't say they are submitting it to the mayor.



"
"Armand Versace er bhashyomote, Jonota abohawar byapare protikriya shuru korar age sorasori ki ghhotechhilo?","The correct answer is **C: Jore batas boichhilo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Prodorshon shuru howar panch minuter modhye ekti batas ghurte shuru korey, pray ek minute pore, batasti 70 kilometres/ghantai pouchai..."" (Within five minutes of the show starting, a wind begins to blow, and after about a minute, the wind reaches 70 kilometers/hour).

Armand Versace's quote comes *after* this description of the wind. The question asks what happened *before* people reacted. Therefore, the strong wind is the event that immediately precedes any reaction from the crowd.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shilabrishti shuru hoyechhilo (Hail started):** Hail comes later in the description, *after* the strong wind and then torrential rain.
*   **B: Prodorshoniti panch minute pichhiye cholchhilo (The show was running five minutes behind):** This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Tini poribarer ek sodosyo ke hariye phelen (He lost a family member):** This is part of Armand Versace's metaphorical quote and not a literal event that occurred before the crowd reacted. It's about his personal feelings of loss, not the immediate situation.



"
"verseser mote, kokhon prochondo batas boite shuru korechhilo?","The correct answer is **A: Prodorshoni shuru howar koyek minute pore**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Prodorshon shuru howar panch minuter modhye ekti batas ghurte shuru korey..."" (Within five minutes of the performance starting, a storm began to swirl...). This directly links the start of the storm to the beginning of the performance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Brishtir pore (After the rain):** The storm *precedes* the heavy rain.
*   **C: Tini tar bonke hariye felar pore (After he lost his boat and companions):** Armand's quote is a separate thought and doesn't indicate *when* the storm started. It's a reflection on his journey.
*   **D: Shilabrishtir age (Before the hail):** The hail comes *after* the initial storm and swirling winds.



"
"Fred-er age, 35°W er purbe koto borho jhorher record kora hoyechhe?","The correct answer is **B: Tin** (Three).

The text states: ""Fried holo satellite chitrer abirbhaber pore thekey ekhono porjonto dakkhin oo purbe record koraa sabcheye shaktishali atolantik krantiya ghurnijhad ebong 35degw-er purbe record howaar **tritiya brihottomo hariken**.""

""Tritiyo"" means third. Therefore, before Fried, there have been two larger hurricanes recorded east of 35°W.
"
"Fred Cape Verde dweeper pashe obosthan korar somoye, eti kon dike egiye jachchhilo?","The correct answer is **D: Uttor-poshchime**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Fried ekhon ghontai 105 mail (165 kimmy/ghanta) bege batas niye **uttor-poschim dike** egiye jachche."" (Fried is now moving north-west at 105 miles (165 km/hour) with the wind.)

Therefore, when Fred was near the Cape Verde islands, it was moving in a **north-west** direction."
Nicher kontir goti er purbosangaskaraner cheye drutotoro?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sorbadhik 600ambit / seconder tattik thruputer saathe 802.11enn er goti tar purbo sangaskaraner tulonay jotheshto drut.""  This translates to: ""With a tactical throughput of up to 600 Mbit/s, the speed of 802.11n is significantly faster than its previous versions.""

Therefore, 802.11n is faster than all the other options (802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11a) which are mentioned as being *compatible with* 802.11n, implying they are older standards.



"
802.11n-er 802.11b-er sathe samonjosyopurnovabe pichhoner dike jawar jonyo konti proyojoniyo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ullekhjogyobhabe druto goti (Notably faster speed)**.

Here's why:

The passage states 802.11n is ""jotheshto drut"" (significantly faster) compared to its predecessors like 802.11b.  The key benefit of 802.11n, and the reason it's an improvement, is its speed.  It achieves up to 600 Mbit/s throughput.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 5.0Ghz-e 802.11b chalanor kkhomota (Ability to run 802.11b on 5.0Ghz):** While 802.11n *can* operate on 5GHz, it doesn't specifically enable 802.11b to run on that frequency. 802.11b primarily uses 2.4GHz.
* **C: 600Mbit/second er throughput (600Mbit/second throughput):** This is a *result* of 802.11n, not the *reason* for backward compatibility.  Backward compatibility means it works *with* slower standards.
* **D: Dual radio (Dual radio):**  Dual radio is a *feature* that *allows* 802.11n to support older standards, but it's not the core requirement for backward compatibility itself. The standard itself ensures compatibility.



"
Olympik sworno podok joyi Commonwealth Games-e santarer jonyo koiti event a chhilen?,"The correct answer is **B: Tin** (Three).

Here's why:

The text states the athlete was prepared to compete in the 100 meter, 200 meter freestyle *and* three relay events (""tinti rile protijogita"").  That makes a total of three events specifically mentioned for swimming.

Therefore, the answer is **Tin**."
Olympik sworno podok joyi tar byathar jonyo oshudh nicchilen na keno?,"The correct answer is **D: Eti Commonwealth Games-e onumodito chhilo na** (It was not permitted in the Commonwealth Games).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The athlete needed medication to manage pain, *but* was excluded from the competition. This strongly implies the medication was the reason for exclusion.
* **The passage also mentions:** Concerns were raised about their physical health and fitness. This suggests the medication might have been seen as performance-enhancing or against the rules.
* **Commonwealth Games have strict rules about prohibited substances.** It's logical to conclude the medication was not allowed under those rules.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tar kono byatha chhilo na (They had no pain):** The passage explicitly states they needed medication for pain.
* **B: Er jonyo tini oshustho bodh korten (They felt unwell because of it):**  The passage focuses on the *impact* of physical issues, not feeling unwell from the medication itself.
* **C: Tini udbigno chhilen je eti tar fitness netibachok probhab phelbe (They were worried it would have a negative impact on their fitness):** The passage highlights concerns about their fitness *due to the physical problem*, not a worry about the medication's impact.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, bhumikampa karjokromer bishoye konti bibhranti srishti korte parto?","The correct answer is **A: Ghono kalo megher uposthiti (The presence of dense black clouds)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the dense black clouds near the volcano led to confusion (""Meghguli bibhrantir asol kaaron tuley dhorechilo kaaron kina sekhane asol bishforon ghotechilo"") because people wondered if they indicated an actual eruption. This shows the clouds created uncertainty about whether volcanic activity (and potentially an earthquake-related event) was occurring.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Icelander abhawa sangkranta officer report:** The passage states the office *hadn't* released any news about earthquakes, which doesn't create confusion, it's a lack of information.
* **C: Antorjatik bhumikamper map:**  The map showed *no* earthquakes, a clear finding, not a source of confusion.
* **D: Iceland-er onyanyo elakar report korar karjokrom:** The passage doesn't mention any reports from other areas of Iceland, and thus doesn't describe any confusion arising from them.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, kokhon porjayer poriborton ghotechhilo?","The correct answer is **C: 10 e March-e** (On March 10th).

The text states: ""Bhumikamper guruttopurno karjokolaper porja parivartan sthan nipechilo marcher 10 tarikhe..."" which translates to ""The area of significant earthquake activity changed location on March 10th...""

Therefore, the change in area occurred *on* March 10th.
"
Chandrayaan-1’er lunar probe somporke kon bakyoti sothik noy?,"The correct answer is **A: Je orbiter probeti chalu korechhilo tate ekjon kormi chhilo** (The orbiter that launched the probe had one worker).

Here's why:

*   **The passage states Chandrayaan-1 was a *manobohin* (unmanned) lunar orbiter.** This directly contradicts option A, which implies a worker was involved in launching the probe.
*   The passage confirms options B, C, and D:
    *   **B: Probe tite gurutwopurno jontro chhilo** (The probe had important instruments) -  The passage says it carried ""tinti guruttopurno boigyanik jontro"" (three important scientific instruments).
    *   **C: Prober ejection sophol hoyechhilo** (The probe's ejection was successful) - The passage describes the probe impacting the moon as intended.
    *   **D: Prober pashguloi rong kora hoyechhilo** (The probe carried images of India) - The passage states the probe carried images of the Indian national flag.

Therefore, option A is the only statement that isn't supported by the provided text."
Nicher kon bakyoti lunar probe ke nirbhulbhabe bornona kore?,"The correct answer is **C: Eti ekti manobbahi orbiter theke nikkhep kora hoy** (It was deployed from a manned orbiter).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Chandrayan-1 naamer manobohin lunar orbiter thekey tar moon impact probe(mip) bichyuto hye..."" (The Moon Impact Probe was released from the Chandrayaan-1, a manned lunar orbiter...). This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eti chander dokkhin merute obatoron kore** (It landed on the south pole of the moon) - The passage says it *impacted* (crashed) near the south pole, not landed.
* **B: Er crash landing sophol hoyechhilo** (Its crash landing was successful) - The passage doesn't state the crash landing was *successful*, only that it impacted.
* **D: Eti duiti joruree jontro bohon korchhilo** (It was carrying two essential instruments) - The passage says it carried *three* important scientific instruments (""Tinti guruttopurno boigyanik jontro"").



"
"Onucchheder bhittite, rogtir biruddhe sukrokkhar kon mandondoti sobseshe proyog kora hobe?","The correct answer is **A: Kitnashok (insecticide spray)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Sarkar lokkhadhik encephalitis tikapurna shishi prodaner protishruti dikeche jaa swastho sachetan sangosthagulike agami bochorer jonno prostuto hote sahajyo korbe...tobhobiler abhab oo anyanno roger tulonay kom agradhikarer karone oitihasikbhabe ee bochor sabcheye beshi khotigrostho anchale vaccine sorboraher porikolponate deri hoyechilo."" and ""...Sarkar...badhyo koreche hajar hajar moshar binosto korte ebong **kitnashok spray** korar moto bivinno podokkhep grohone"".

The passage explicitly mentions insecticide spraying (""kitnashok spray"") as one of the measures the government is taking to combat the disease.  While vaccines are *promised*, they aren't the immediate action being taken as described in the sentence immediately before this query.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Shukor dhorar fand (catching pigs):** The passage mentions culling pigs (destroying them), but not catching them as a primary method of control.
*   **C: Encephalitis teeka (encephalitis vaccine):** The vaccine is a future provision, not the current method of combating the disease that's being implemented.
*   **D: Moshari (mosquito net):** While mosquito nets are useful for preventing mosquito-borne diseases, the passage specifically identifies the disease as being transmitted by pigs after being carried by snails, making insecticide spray a more direct response.



"
Rogti kibhabe manusher modhye chhorhiye porte pare?,"The correct answer is **A: Mosha (Mosquito)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ei rogti shukorer dwara bahito, jaa pore moshar madhyome manusher dehe sthanantorito hoy."" This translates to ""This disease is transmitted by pigs, which is then transferred to the human body through mosquitoes.""

Therefore, mosquitoes are the vector that carries the disease to humans.
"
Ditwiyo bakyer byarthota kon phol ante pare?,"The correct answer is **B: Somokami nagorik union er bhobishyot odhikar (Future rights of civic unions)**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Dwitiya bakyer byarthota, jaa samakami nagrik union nishiddho korar prostab korey, sombhoboto bhabishyate sushil union jonno darja khule ditey paare."" This directly translates to ""The failure of the second proposal, which proposed to prohibit civic unions, may open the door for civil unions in the future.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: HJR-3-er tatkhonik porjalochona (Immediate consideration of HJR-3):** While HJR-3 is mentioned in relation to future review, the failure of the second proposal doesn't *immediately* trigger HJR-3's consideration.
*   **C: Ainsobhar odhibeshon (Legislative session):** The legislative session is a general context, not a direct result of the proposal's failure.
*   **D: Somokami nagorikder union e nishedhagga (Prohibition of civic unions):** The failure of the proposal *prevents* the prohibition of civic unions, it doesn't cause it.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, ditwiyo bakyoti kokhon muchhe phela hoy?","The correct answer is **A: Ainsobhar odhibeshon cholakale** (During the legislative session).

Here's why:

The text states: ""House obo representativeder dwara Ditiyo bakyoti baad hoye jaoar pore ebong tarpor Eki roope tha sombare senate dwara push howar pore ei aain prononer adhibeshone ekti parivartan koraa hoy."" This translates to: ""After the second amendment was rejected by the House representatives and then pushed through as a single item by the Senate on Monday, a change was made during the legislative session of this law.""

Therefore, the second amendment was rejected *during* the legislative session.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 2011 sale** - 2011 is when the initial push happened, not when the second amendment was rejected.
*   **C: Sombare** - Monday is when the Senate pushed through the bill, not when the amendment was rejected.
*   **D: 2015 sale** - 2015/2016 is when the law will be *re-examined*, not when the amendment was rejected.



"
“Panama Papers” kar kachhe fans kora hoy?,"The correct answer is **A: Mossack Fonseca firm**.

Here's why:

The text states: """"""""""""""Panama papers"""""""" holo panamanian aain sanstha **mosack fonsekar** pray dash million documenter ekti sanrakkhan..."""""" (Panama Papers is a collection of ten million documents from the Panamanian law firm **Mossack Fonseca**...)

The Panama Papers *originated* from the documents held by Mossack Fonseca. While other entities (like Deutsche Bank and the press) were *involved* in the revelations, Mossack Fonseca was the source.



"
"Onucchhed mote, British press sompod lukanor jonyo byabohrito odhikangsho company ke porichalona korchhe bole dabi kore?","The correct answer is **C: Deutsche Bank**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""British sanbadmadhyam guardian prokashito koreche je **dacha bank** 1200 shell sangosthar pray ek tritiyangsho niyantran korey jaa ei lokkho bastobayone byabohar hoyeche."" 

This directly translates to: ""British news medium Guardian published that **Deutsche Bank** controls about one-third of 1200 shell companies which were used for this purpose.""

Therefore, the British press is claiming Deutsche Bank managed most of the companies used to hide wealth.



"
Nicher kon biman durghotonay mrityur har sobcheye beshi?,"The correct answer is **A: Armenia theke Iran jawar pothe biman durghotona** (The plane crash on the way from Armenia to Iran).

The text states: ""...armeniyagami ekti biman biddhosto hye 168 jon nihoto hoyechilo"" which translates to ""...a plane crashed in Armenia, resulting in the death of 168 people."" This is significantly higher than the other incidents mentioned:

*   Police helicopter crash: 3 deaths
*   Mashhad plane crash: ""sotero jon nihoto hoy"" (around 70 deaths - less than 168)

Therefore, the Armenia-Iran flight crash had the highest death toll."
Nicher konti Irane bipul songkhyok biman durghotonar karon noy?,"The correct answer is **C: Nishedhagga ja notun biman kroye badha day (Sanctions that restrict buying new planes)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Antorjatik nishedhaggar maane holo notun biman crow koraa jabena (International sanctions mean new planes cannot be bought)."" This directly indicates sanctions *prevent* new plane purchases, they don't *cause* accidents.

Let's look at why the other options *are* causes mentioned in the passage:

*   **A: Samorik o besamorik bimaner purono bohor (Old fleets of military and civilian planes):** The passage begins by stating accidents are common due to aging fleets.
*   **B: Notun biman kroyer jonyo budget boradder ghatti (Budget constraints for buying new planes):** This is implied when the passage mentions sanctions prevent purchasing new aircraft, suggesting a lack of funds or ability to do so.
*   **D: Biman bohorer nimnomaner rokkhonabekkhon (Lack of maintenance of aircraft fleets):** The passage alludes to poor upkeep when it states planes aren't properly maintained (""rakkhanabekkhan koraa hoy naa"").

Therefore, the sanctions themselves don't *cause* the accidents, they contribute to the problem by preventing the solution (replacing old planes)."
Iraq Study Group theke pawa report e nicher konti ontorbhukto kora hoyni?,"The correct answer is **B: Ekti ghoshona jate bola hoy nirdishto poribortoner madhyome, Iraq e kromobordhoman sohingsota erhiye jawa jay.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the report acknowledges that *no one can guarantee* Iraq won't descend into sectarian violence, chaos, or increased bloodshed. This directly contradicts option B, which suggests the report offers a declaration that Iraq can *avoid* escalating violence through specific changes. 

Let's look at why the other options are included in the passage:

*   **A: Bortoman neetir somalochona:** The passage says the report ""criticizes the current policy regarding Iraq.""
*   **C: Iraq er seemana nirapod korar suparish:** The passage mentions a recommendation to ""secure Iraq's border against foreign interference.""
*   **D: Markin Juktorashtrer oikyamotyer jonyo onurodh:** The passage states the report ""calls for a unified US approach on Middle East policy."""
Iraq Study Group er report e nicher kontite jor arop koreni?,"Correct answer is **B: Diknirdeshonar tatkkhonik poriborton**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Iraq Study Group *criticized* the current policies and even mentioned ""বিলম্বিত ডিক (Dick)""'s words about it. This implies they were advocating for a change in direction, but not necessarily an *immediate* change (""tatkkhonik poriborton"").

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned in the passage:

*   **A: Kromobordhoman sohingsota bondho korte ekti nishchoyotar ghoshona:** The report warns about the risk of escalating sectarian violence.
*   **C: Mukto bitorker byabohar:** The report ""প্রকাশ করে মুক্ত বিতর্ক"" (highlights open discussion).
*   **D: Notun kutnoytik uddeshyo protishtha:** The report suggests a ""নতুন কূটনৈতিক উদ্যোগ"" (new diplomatic effort) and restoring relations with neighbors.

Therefore, the report did *not* emphasize an immediate change in direction."
"Police er mote, ke Provenzano’r dan-hat hisebe bibechito hoto?","The correct answer is **B: Low picolo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pulish janiyeche low picolor jonno suvidha chhilo beshi kaaron Tini palermote provenjanor daan haat chhilen..."" This translates to ""Police knew that Low Picolo had more advantages because he was Provenzano's right-hand man in Palermo..."" 

Therefore, Low Picolo was considered Provenzano's ""daan-hat"" (right-hand man).



"
"Oucchheder tothyer bhittite, Falcone er mrityur karon ki?","The correct answer is **A: Tini Rina-porichalito juddher somoye mara jan** (He died during the Rina-led war).

Here's why:

The text states: ""1992 saale rashtrer biruddhe rina porichalito bidroher abosan ghotiachilen provenjano. ei somei mafiya crusader diovani falcon ebong paonlo borcelinor mrityu hoy."" This translates to: ""In 1992, Provenzano's rebellion against the state ended. During this time, mafia crusaders Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino died.""

This directly links Falcone's death to the period of conflict initiated by Rina.  The other options are not supported by the text.
"
Nicher konti Hitoshi Saito er orjito sommangulir ekti noy?,"The correct answer is **A: Duibarer Biswa Champion (Two-time World Champion)**.

Here's why:

The text states Hitoshi Saito was a two-time Olympic gold medalist (Duibarer Olympic sworno podok joyi) and a former Olympic and world champion. It also mentions he was the chairman of the 'All Japan Judo Federation training committee' and was a Judo expert implicitly through being a successful Judoka. However, it **doesn't** specifically say he was a two-time world champion.

Therefore, option A is the one achievement *not* explicitly mentioned in the provided text."
Ivashaki kothay biye erhiye jete perechhilen?,"The correct answer is **B: Nepal**.

The passage states: ""nepale biye thekey paliyechilo"" which translates to ""escaped from a wedding in Nepal"". Therefore, Ivashaki escaped a wedding *in* Nepal."
Ke Ivashaki-ke akromon kore?,"The correct answer is **B: Jolodosyu**.

The passage states ""Jaladasyura tar thekey loot korechilo"" which means Jaladasyura attacked/robbed Ivashaki.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tar hobu stree** - The passage doesn't mention any attack by a woman.
*   **C: Ekti kukur** - While a dog attacked him in Tibet, the question asks who attacked *Ivashaki* generally, and Jaladasyura's robbery is the first attack mentioned.
*   **D: Police** - The police *arrested* him, they didn't attack him."
Alonso tar race kokhon shesh kore?,"The correct answer is **A: Schumacher tar samner chaka noshto korar pore** (After Schumacher's front wheel was damaged).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Asankhya douwo protijogita chalakalin suspension damager karone alonsore pore poroi michael shumakhar tar daud shes korechilen."" This translates to: ""Due to numerous competitive drivers having suspension damage, after Alonso, Michael Schumacher finished his race.""

This clearly indicates Alonso finished his race *before* Schumacher, and Schumacher finished after a problem with his front wheel (related to the suspension damage affecting other drivers).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Fisichella tar garhir niyontron haranor pore** (After Fisichella lost control of his car): The text says Fisichella lost control, but doesn't link it to Alonso finishing the race.
*   **C: Schumacher tar nijer race shesh korar pore** (After Schumacher finished his own race): This is the opposite of what the text states.
*   **D: Netritwo newar age** (Before taking the lead): The text doesn't mention Alonso trying to take the lead. It says he was *ahead* of the competition.



"
Schumacher ki karone tar race age shesh koren?,"The correct answer is **D: Garhir suspension kkhotigrostho howate** (Due to the car's suspension being damaged).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Asankhya douwo protijogita chalakalin suspension damager karone alonsore pore poroi michael shumakhar tar daud shes korechilen."" This directly translates to ""Numerous competing drivers, due to suspension damage, after Alonso, Michael Schumacher finished his race.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tini tar garhir niyontron hariye phelen** (He lost control of his car) - The passage states Fisichella lost control, not Schumacher.
*   **B: Alonsor sathe songghorsher karone** (Due to a collision with Alonso) - The passage doesn't mention a collision between Schumacher and Alonso.
*   **C: Fisichellar karone chaka noshto howate** (Due to a wheel being destroyed because of Fisichella) - The passage doesn't link Fisichella to Schumacher's issue.



"
"Onucchhed mote, greptar howa byaktider jamin dewa kar dayitwo?","The correct answer is **D: Court commissioner**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jodi manjuriprapta hoy ebong greptarkari kormokortar dwara dayerkrito abhijogguli boidho hoy tobe commissioner jameen diye deyo."" This translates to: ""If approved and the charges filed by the arresting officer are valid, then the **commissioner** grants bail.""

Therefore, the court commissioner is responsible for granting bail to the arrested individuals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Greptarkari kormokorta (Arresting officer):** The passage states the commissioner grants bail *if* the charges filed by the arresting officer are valid, they don't grant the bail themselves.
*   **B: Judge Glynn:** Judge Glynn issued a temporary restraining order *against* the quick release, they don't grant bail.
*   **C: Central Booking facility:** The facility releases people, but based on the commissioner's decision, not their own.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shunanite sondehobhajoner drutobicharer adhikarer jonno tarikho chinnito koraa hoy."" This translates to ""A date is set for a hearing to determine the right to a speedy trial for those detained.""

The temporary restraining order issued by Judge Glynn requires a hearing to justify detaining individuals for over 24 hours.  The individuals must be brought before the court for a hearing to challenge their detention.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jameen (Bail):** While bail is mentioned later in the passage *if* the charges are valid, it isn't the immediate requirement triggered by the temporary restraining order.
* **B: Greptarkari kormokortar sathe meeting (Meeting with arresting officers):**  The passage doesn't mention any requirement for a meeting with arresting officers.
* **C: Judge Glynn kortrik jari kora anushthanik charges (Formal charges issued by Judge Glynn’s court):** The passage mentions formal charges being *entered* into the state computer system later, but the hearing is what's required to justify the initial extended detention.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, runoff batil korar karon byakkhya korar jonno kon karon byabohar kora hoyni?","The correct answer is **B: Sangbidhaner poriponthi (Constitutional completeness)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the official *rejected* the argument that cancelling the election was ""constitutional completeness"" (sangbidhaner poriponthi). This means it wasn't a reason *used* to justify cancelling the runoff. The other options *were* reasons mentioned:

*   **Nirapottai jhunki (Security risk)** - Explicitly stated as a reason.
*   **Beshi kharcha (High cost)** - Explicitly stated as a reason.
*   **Sangbidhane osposhtota (Ambiguity in the constitution)** - The official found ambiguity in the constitution, leading to their decision.

Therefore, the only option not used as a justification is ""constitutional completeness."""
Shesh porjonto keno Kutnitikera kaachhe runoff oproyojoniyo bole mone kora hoyechhilo?,"The correct answer is **C: Sangbidhane osposhtota chhilo** (There was ambiguity in the constitution).

Here's why:

The passage states that the diplomat found ""jotheshto osposhtota"" (significant ambiguity) in the Afghan constitution. This led them to conclude the runoff plan was unnecessary.  The other options are mentioned as factors, but the *reason* for the diplomat's decision was the constitutional ambiguity.

* **A** is incorrect because the passage states the runoff cancellation was *against* previous reports saying it was constitutionally required.
* **B** and **D** are mentioned as reasons the election was cancelled, but not the primary reason *why the diplomat thought a runoff was unnecessary.*



"
Eff ee ti ee -er jonno proshashonik suvidhaguli k prodan kore?,"The correct answer is **B: rajnaitik dalalder**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pakistani president ... niog korechen, jara eisob elakar upor pray-sampurna swashasaner nintron komey rekheche. Pakistaner sangbidhaner 247 number dhara anujai proshashonik suvidha pradan oo sarkari byabosthaponar jonno **ei agentgulii daee**.""

""Ei agentgulii"" refers to the ""rajnaitik dalalder"" (political agents) mentioned earlier in the text.  They are the ones providing administrative facilities (proshashonik suvidha) and establishing government systems for F.F.T.I.E. (the area in question).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pakistani sarkar:** While the Pakistani government authorized it, the *agents* are the ones directly providing the facilities.
*   **C: Pakistani president:** The president *appointed* the agents, but didn't directly provide the facilities.
*   **D: British sarkar:** The British were no longer in power at this time (after 1947 independence).



"
Eff ee ti ee -er “rajnaitik dalalder” somporke nicher bibritigulir modhye konti sotyo noy?,"The correct answer is **C: Tara Pakistaner sangbidhan mene chole.**

Here's why:

The passage states the ""political agents"" were appointed by the Pakistani President to *govern* certain areas, essentially bypassing full self-governance. While they operated *under* the authority granted by Article 247 of the Pakistani constitution (allowing for administrative facilities and governmental setups), it doesn't mean they *followed* the constitution in the usual sense of upholding rights and democratic processes. They were implementing a specific, controlled administration.

Let's break down why the other options are true based on the passage:

*   **A: Tara proshashonik suvidha prodan kore** - The passage explicitly states they were providing administrative facilities (""proshashonik suvidha pradan"").
*   **B: Tara Pakistani president dwara nirbachito** -  The passage clearly says they were appointed (""niog korechen"") by the Pakistani President.
*   **D: Koyekti nirdishto elakay tader sampurna niyontron royechhe** - The passage states they exerted ""pray-sampurna swashasaner nintron kome rekheche"" (nearly complete control) over these areas.

The text states that both Gosling and Stone received nominations for best actor and actress (""sera abhineta oo abhinetrir jonno mononoyon peyechilen""). Therefore, Emma Stone was nominated for Best Actress.
"
Cinemati kon puroshkarer jonno mononoyon hoyni?,"The correct answer is **B: Sera Visual Effects**.

Here's why:

The text lists all the nominations *received* by the film. It specifically mentions nominations for:

*   Sera Chhobi (Best Picture)
*   Sera abhineta/abhinetri (Best Actor/Actress)
*   Porichalok (Best Director)
*   Cinematography
*   Costume Design
*   Cholochchitro-sampadana (Film Editing)

Visual Effects is *not* mentioned in the list of nominations. Therefore, it did not receive a nomination.



"
Bhumikamper por nicher konti chalu chhilo?,"The correct answer is **A: Hokurikur Shika paromanobik vidyutkendrer sobguli paromanobik chulli**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hokuriku bidyut sanstha janieche bhumikamper kono prabhab padeni ebong taader shika paromanobik vidyutkendre 1 ebong 2 number paromanobik chulli bondho korey deoa hoyeche."" This means *all* the reactors at the Shika nuclear power plant were shut down, implying they were running before the earthquake.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ishikaoa-er bimanbandarti:** The text says the Ishikaoa airport was *closed* (""bondho royeche"").
*   **C: Somosto rail seba:** The text states rail service was *disrupted* (""bighnito hoyeche"").
*   **D: Nigata elakar paromanobik shaktikendrati:** The text says the power plant was operating normally, but doesn't specify if it continued to operate *after* the earthquake, only that there was no initial impact. Importantly, reactors were shut down.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, bhumikamper karone nicher kontite sthayee khoti hoyechhe?","The correct answer is **C: Kichhu rasta** (Some roads).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Kichhu rasta nashta hoyeche"" which translates to ""Some roads have been damaged.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kichhu badi:** While 9400 homes are *without water*, the passage doesn't say they are *damaged* (destroyed).
* **B: Shika paromanobik vidyutkendrer duti paromanobik chulli:** The nuclear reactors were *shut down* as a precaution, not damaged.
* **D: Notto bimanbandar:** The airport is *closed*, but the passage doesn't state it's been damaged.

"Onuchchhed onujaayee, nicher kon samasyati ei doliltite antarbhukta kora hoyni?","The correct answer is **B: 1967 saaler juddher karon** (The reason for the 1967 war).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    * **Jerusalemer bhabishyater abostha** (The future status of Jerusalem) - it states this is included in the news.
    * **Upottokai samrik bahinir uposthiti** (The presence of military forces in the occupied territories) - it details Israel's claim to keep forces there and the agreed-upon extension.
    * **Seemanto niye birodh** (Border disputes) - the text begins by stating the discussion revolves around border issues related to the Philistines and the 1967 war.

* **The passage does *not* mention:**
    * **1967 saaler juddher karon** (The reason for the 1967 war) - While the war is referenced as a context for the border disputes and occupation, the passage doesn't discuss *why* the war happened. It only focuses on its aftermath.



"
Nicher konti Philistine er daabigulir modhye nei?,"The correct answer is **C: Jerusalemer bhabishyater abostha songkranto prashner uttor** (The answer to questions regarding the future status of Jerusalem).

Here's why:

The passage states Jerusalem's future status is *included among* the issues Philistine wants discussed, meaning it's a topic *for* discussion, not a demand *by* Philistine. The other options are all explicitly listed as demands:

*   **A: Juddher aager obosthar upor vitti kore seemanto** (Border based on the situation before the war) - Philistine wants borders as they were before the 1967 war.
*   **B: Jordan upottokai bortomane samrik bahinir uposthiti** (The presence of military forces in the Jordan region) - Philistine wants this addressed.
*   **D: Jordan upottokai panch bochorer jonno millitaryder uposthiti** (The presence of military forces in the Jordan region for five years) - Israel has agreed to this, and Philistine is involved in that negotiation.

Therefore, option C is the only one that doesn't represent a demand *from* Philistine, but rather a topic of discussion *about* Jerusalem.



"
Ma kon deshe aain niye parashuna korechhilen?,"The correct answer is **A: Markin Juktorashtro (United States of America)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tini eksam markin juktorashtrer sthai basinda hisabe """"green card"""" paan."" (She obtained a ""green card"" as a permanent resident of the United States of America.) and ""new irk bishwobidyal ebong harvard aain schoole paroi pore"" (studied at New York University and Harvard Law School). This clearly indicates she studied and sought residency in the USA.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: China** - The text mentions a connection with the Chinese mainland later, but doesn't say she studied law there.
*   **C: Australia** - There is no mention of Australia in the text.
*   **D: Hong Kong** - While her birthplace is Hong Kong, the question asks where she studied law, and the text points to the US.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, Ma er nirbachone jeetar kkhetre kon desher pokkhe okaloti kora take sahajyo korechilo?","The correct answer is **A: Markin Juktorashtro (United States of America)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the mother (""Maa"") received a ""green card"" and became a permanent resident of the United States (""juktorashtrer sthai basinda""). This implies her election victory was aided by her connection to, and ability to live in, the United States.  The passage also mentions she considered leaving the country (""desh chhei paliye jete paren"") which further reinforces the link to the US as a potential safe haven.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hong Kong:** While she was born in Hong Kong, the passage doesn't state it helped her *election* victory.
* **C: Juktorajjya (United Kingdom):** The passage doesn't mention any connection to the UK.
* **D: China:** The passage mentions a connection to the Chinese mainland, but frames it negatively (potential propaganda/influence) and doesn't suggest it aided her election.

"Onuchchhede jemonta bola hoyechhe sei onusare, shohor chharhar aage caroline willson kar jonno kaj korechhilen?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

The passage states: ""...sangshlishtho poribargulor beshirbhagi hothat bujhte parol je oaecha er caroline willson taader nirapatta jamanoto churi korey shohor chhei paliye geche.""  This translates to ""...many of the affected families suddenly realized that Caroline Wilson of OHA had stolen their security deposits and fled the city.""

Therefore, before fleeing the city, Caroline Wilson worked for OHA (presumably a housing authority).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: East Bay Community Law Center:** The Law Center *hosted* a meeting, but Caroline Wilson didn't work for them.
*   **B: Oakland police:** The passage implies the police are *investigating* the situation, not that Caroline Wilson worked for them.
*   **D: Lockwood gardener:** Lockwood Gardener is a resident who *believes* others are affected, he's not Caroline Wilson's employer.

"Morshume baki charti douwo theke, k driverder championship ee choturtho sthan arjon korechhen?","The correct answer is **B: Keney**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Stuart, gordon, kensoth ebong harvik morsumer aro baaki charti douwo baaki thakar modhye driver championship ee sheersho dashti sthane adhikar orjon koreche."" This means Stuart, Gordon, Kenseth, and Harvick are in the top ten.  It also states ""Tritia sthane hamlin quie pent pichie kintu bower thekey panch pent egie royeche. Keney ebong trucks junior jothakrome 2,220 ebong 2,207 pent peeyee pancham oo shostho sthane royeche.""

Therefore, Hamlin is 3rd, Bower is behind him (lower points), and Keney is 5th or 6th. This places Keney in 4th place among the remaining four drivers mentioned.

Therefore, Keney has 2220 points."

Therefore, humans have seen Martian meteorites (those proven to originate from Mars) 34 times.

The passage states: ""Prithibite potito howaar pray 24,000 porichito ulkapinder modhye matro pray 34 tear utpotti mangal grohe bole nischito howaar gechhe.""  This translates to: ""Out of the approximately 24,000 known meteorites found on Earth, only about 34 have been definitively identified as originating from Mars.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ei sobgulikei julai maaser ulkapater somoy pawa gechhe** (These were all found during the July meteorite event) - The passage mentions July's meteorite event *includes* some of these, but doesn't say *all* of them were found then.
*   **B: Sob miliye 24,000 ti chhilo** (There were a total of 24,000) - The passage states 24,000 is the total number of *known meteorites* found on Earth, not the number from Mars.
*   **C: Seguli sooner cheye $11,000 er beshi mulyer** (They are worth more than $11,000 than gold) - The passage mentions the price of Martian meteorites is between $11,000 and $22,500 *per ounce*, and that this is 10 times more than gold, not a direct comparison to gold's value plus $11,000.

Here's why:

*   **A: Felipe Massa er durghotonar pore** - While the accident *led* to Shumachar replacing Massa, the text specifies it was after the championship win.
*   **C: Felipe Massar bodoli howar por** - ""Bodoli"" means change, and while Massa was replaced, the text doesn't focus on the change itself but the timing *after* the championship win.
*   **D: 2009 saaler morsum shesh howar por** - The 2009 incident is a separate event mentioned later in the text, not when Shumachar initially took over.



"

Here's why:

The text states Massa was injured *after* Schumacher won the Formula 1 championship in 2006. This is the direct cause mentioned for his injury.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ekti Grand Prix cholar somoy** - While he was injured during a Grand Prix, the text specifies *when* - after Schumacher's win.
*   **C: Shumacharer er abosar grahaner aage** - The injury happened *after* Schumacher took over.
*   **D: 2009 saaler morsum shuru howar aage** - The text mentions his injury in 2009, but links it back to the 2006 championship win."

The passage states: ""Yahoo! ebong microsoft poriseba byaboharkarir sankhya somoilitobhabe aol-er grahok sankhyake protidwondita korbe.""  This directly translates to ""Yahoo! and Microsoft service users will competitively challenge AOL's customer base.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aol er byaboharkarider sankhya briddhi pawar sombhabonar karone** - (Because of the possibility of AOL's user base increasing) - The passage doesn't say AOL's user base *will* increase, but that it will be *challenged*.
* **B: aol hobe ekmatro company jara im market toiri koreche** - (AOL will be the only company that created this market) - The passage doesn't claim this; it states AOL has been able to develop *within* an existing market.
* **D: America juktorashtre AOL ar konodin byabohar kora hobe na** - (AOL will never be used in the United States again) - The passage does not suggest AOL will disappear, only that its independence might be lost.



"
Notun byabostha onusoron kore nicher konti shesh hote pare?,"The correct answer is **C: AOL er nijoswo gotite bajar toirir swadhinota (AOL's freedom to create its own market)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that due to widespread use of instant messaging (IM) in America, AOL has the *potential* to shift and develop *within* the IM market. However, it also warns that *along with* this system, AOL's **independence (swadhinota)** could be lost. This loss of independence would be due to competition from Yahoo! and Microsoft.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: American juktorashtre internet byaboharer byapok unnoti (Widespread growth of internet usage in America):** The passage doesn't suggest internet usage will decline. It's the *growth* of IM *within* that usage that's relevant.
*   **B: IM market er byabohar (Use of the IM market):** The passage says IM use is *increasing*, not decreasing.
*   **D: Yahoo ebong Microsofter ongshidaritwo (Yahoo and Microsoft's share):** While Yahoo and Microsoft are competitors, the passage focuses on what AOL might *lose*, not what they might *gain*.

The text states: ""Governor office thekey janano hoyeche je ahotoder modhye unishjon pulish officer chhilo."" (It was announced from the Governor's office that among those injured, there were nineteen police officers.)

Therefore, 19 police officers were injured in the attack."

The text states: ""Pulish janiyeche je taaraa humler jonno abhijukto dayesh (isil) jangike sandeha koreche."" This translates to ""Police have come to know and suspect the Dayesh (ISIL) militant group for the attack.""  Therefore, the police are the ones reporting the suspicion regarding the attackers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Governor er office theke** - The Governor's office only released the information about the number of injured, not the suspicion of who was behind the attack.
*   **C: Sangbadikra** - The text doesn't mention journalists reporting the suspicion.

This translates to: ""As the second state overall, Florida awarded Romney with its sixty-five delegates, propelling him forward as a leader for the Republican party's nomination.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rajyer 32 jon protinidhi (32 representatives of the state)** - Newt Gingrich received 32% of the vote, not Romney.
*   **C: Rajyer sakal protinidhi (Total representatives of the state)** - The passage mentions 65 delegates, not the total number of representatives.
*   **D: Nirbachan  46 shotangsho (46% of the vote)** - Romney won with 46% of the vote, but that wasn't the *award* he received *from* Florida. The award was the boost towards the nomination.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, prathomik nirbachone Jingrich koto shotangsho vote peyechhilen?","The correct answer is **B: 32 shotangsho**.

"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, sovar er folafoler pore k ar protidwondita obyahoto rakhenni?","The correct answer is **B: Backman**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Backman jini august masse ams straw pole jitechilen Tini tar abhiyan shes korar siddhanta niyechilen."" This translates to ""Backman, who won the Ames straw poll in August, decided to end her campaign.""  Ending her campaign means she *did not* continue to compete after the results were published.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **Gingrich:** The passage says Gingrich publicly criticized Santorum *after* the results, implying he continued to compete.
*   **Peri:** The passage states Perry said he would return to Texas to assess but then announced he *would* compete in South Carolina.
*   **Romney:** Romney was running a campaign *against* Gingrich, and thus continued to compete.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, sovar folafol prokasher pore k onyanyo prartheeder somporke otirikto katha bolechilen?","The correct answer is **B: Gingrich**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Folafol prokasher pore gingrich jonosomokkhe santorumer proshongsha korechilo."" This translates to ""After the release of the poll, Gingrich publicly praised Santorum.""

The question asks who *else* said something *after* the poll release. Gingrich is the only one explicitly stated to have done so.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Backman** - The text states Backman *ended* her campaign, not what she said after the poll.
*   **C: Romney** - The text mentions Romney was criticized *because of* a campaign against Gingrich, but doesn't say Romney said anything *after* the poll release.
*   **D: Peri** - Perry's quotes are about *considering* whether to continue in the race, not a reaction *after* the poll release.

The text states: ""Agekar dine ei show dirghosomoy dhorey chola internet radio station **toginetradiote** procharito hoto...""

The text explicitly states: """"""ekti notun ebong mojadar spinner saathe **purano school radio theatre**"""""""" (a new and delightful spinner with **old school radio theatre**). 

Therefore, the stationer website describes a ""purano school"" (old school) type of spinner.

The passage states: ""David headlyr sangraha koraa **tothyo** pakistani jongi sangathan lashkar-ii-toiyobar 10 jon bondukdharike abhiyan korte sahayata korechilo."" 

This directly translates to ""David Headly's collected **information** helped the Pakistani militant organization Lashkar-e-Taiba's 10 gunmen carry out the attack.""

The other options are things *used* in the attack, not what Headly *provided* to help it happen:

*   **Grenade:** A weapon used during the attack.
*   **Bondukdhari:** (Gunmen) - The attackers themselves.
*   **swayankriya astro:** (Automatic weapons) - Also weapons used in the attack.

The passage clearly states: ""Mumbai hamlakarira 26 shhey navembar, 2008 ee **nauka korey ashe**..."" which translates to ""The attackers came to Mumbai on November 26, 2008 **by boat**..."". 

Therefore, the militants used a boat to reach Mumbai."

*   It further mentions Nadal won the first set 7-6 and had an 88% net point success rate.
*   Nadal also expressed his desire to win the tournament.

Therefore, the passage clearly indicates Nadal won against Raonic in the Brisbane Open match.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Raonic Nadal k haray** - The passage explicitly states Nadal's winning record against Raonic.
*   **B: Raonic er 88% nett pent chhilo** - The passage states Nadal had 88% net point success, not Raonic.

The passage states: ""Nadal prothom survey 76 pent niye myachtite 88% nett pent dokhol korechilo."" This directly translates to ""Nadal won the first set 76 points to..."" and mentions his net points.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Raonic er 88% nett pent chhilo** - While the passage mentions Raonic's net points, it doesn't say he *had* 88% net points, it states Nadal *scored* 88% net points.
*   **C: Score ti chhilo 7-2** - This refers to Nadal's overall head-to-head record against Canadian players, not the specific match against Raonic.
*   **D: Raonic Nadal k haray** - The passage doesn't indicate who won the match. It only discusses the first set."
Tinti notun Naked News somprocharer modhye kon bhasar program antarbhukto noi?,"The correct answer is **C: japani**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Naked News is launching programs in Spanish, Italian, and Korean. It also mentions they *already* report in English and Japanese. Therefore, Japanese is not one of the *new* broadcasts being launched.

"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, notun Naked News somprochar kothay pawa jabe na?","The correct answer is **B: Internet**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Naked News is expanding its international language mandate and will be offering programs for ""biswa sangosthati television, web, ebong mobile devicer jonno"" (world organizations - television, **web**, and mobile devices). This clearly indicates the new broadcasts will be available on the internet (web).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cellphone** - While mobile devices are mentioned, ""web"" is a broader term encompassing internet access on phones, tablets, etc.
*   **C: Theater** - The passage doesn't mention anything about theatrical releases.
*   **D: Television** - Television is mentioned, but alongside the web and mobile devices, not as the sole platform. The focus is on expanding *beyond* traditional television with the new languages.



"
Kotojon protijogi giant slalom shes koreni?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""giant slalmer moat 117 jon skitchaloker modhye 45 jon doure sthan petey byartho hoyechilo"" which translates to ""out of 117 skiers in the giant slalom, 45 failed to finish"". Therefore, 45 skiers did not finish the giant slalom."
Nicher kon bibrititi championshipe daud er folafol k sothikvabe protipholito kore?,"The correct answer is **D: slalam-e carpenado dasham sthane shes korechhilen**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""tar [Carpenado] giant slalom, prothom sthane thaka austrian finisher claudia loshcher cheye 2:11.60 minute pichie ebong nobom sthane thaka hangerir finisher gayanji daani er cheye 1:09.02 minute pichie dasham sthane tar abosthan sorbomot 4:41.30 minute somponno koren.""  This directly translates to Carpenado finishing in 10th place in the Giant Slalom. And earlier it mentions they didn't finish their first run in Slalom.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Anno ekti daud-e, Carpenado Hungary er ekjon skier er aage shesh korechhilen** - The passage doesn't mention anything about finishing ahead of a Hungarian skier.
* **B: Giant Slalom e 45 jon skitchalock taader douwo shes korte byartho hoyechilo** - The passage states 45 skiers *failed to finish* the course, not that they tried and failed.
* **C: slalam er tulonay Giant Slalom-e beshi skitchalock shesh korechhilen** - The passage says 36 skiers failed to finish in Slalom and 45 in Giant Slalom, so *more* skiers failed to finish in Giant Slalom, but the question asks which accurately reflects the results, not which had more failures.



"
Nicher kontik nba sthogito korar siddhanto grohon korechhilo?,"The correct answer is **A: Basketball mousum**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the NBA ""sthogito koreche"" (suspended) the ""basketball mousum"" (basketball season) due to a player testing positive for COVID-19. The question asks what the NBA suspended.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ekjon utter jyaja badok** (A senior player) - The NBA didn't suspend the player, but the season *because* a player tested positive.
*   **C: COVID-19 er porikkhay positive hoyechhen emon jekono kheloyarh** (Any player who tested positive for COVID-19) -  While a positive test triggered the suspension, the NBA didn't suspend *players* who tested positive, they suspended the season.
*   **D: utter jyaja basketball doltik** (The senior player's basketball team) - The suspension wasn’t limited to a single team.



"
"Onuchhed onujayee, kiser karone virus niye nba er udweg dekha daay?","The correct answer is **D: porikkhay Ekjon utter jyaja badok er positive eshechhe** (A prominent player tested positive for the virus).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ekjon utter jyaja badok covid-19 positive assa nba siddhanta neigh."" This translates to ""A prominent player testing positive for COVID-19 led to the NBA's decision.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: nba er sodosyoder porikkhay postive eshechhe** (NBA members have tested positive) - While this might be true generally, the passage *specifically* mentions a prominent player.
*   **B: utter jyaja khelay koyek jon kheloyarher porikkhay positive eshechhe** (Several players tested positive during a prominent game) - The passage doesn't mention a game, just a player.
*   **C: Porikkhay positive howar pore ekjon utter jyaja badok kharap performance korechhe** (A prominent player performed poorly after testing positive) - The passage doesn't mention performance. It only states the positive test *led to* a decision.



"

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ovechkiner rather prothom sahayata chhilo rookie nicklas backstrom dwara game vijayi gole"" which translates to ""Ovechkin's first assist was by rookie Nicklas Backstrom for the game-winning goal.""

Therefore, Nicklas Backstrom assisted on the game-winning goal."
Capitals bonam thrushers er khelay k tar mousumer 60tom goal ti korechhilen?,"The correct answer is **C: alex ovekkin**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ovechkiner rather dwitiya goal chhilo mousumer 60tom, prothom kono kheload hye jini 1995-96 sholo thekey Eki mousume 60 baa totodhik goal korechen..."" This translates to: ""Ovechkin's second goal was his 60th of the season, the first player to reach 60 or more goals in a season since 1995-96, when Iaromir Jagr and Mario Lemieux both reached that milestone.""

The question asks *who* scored their 60th goal. The text explicitly states it was Ovechkin.  The names Jagr and Lemieux are mentioned only as the last players to achieve that feat *before* Ovechkin.



"
Nordan rock bankti er kokhon sarkar er kachh theke sahayata proyojon hoyechhilo?,"The correct answer is **D: Mortgage sankater somei** (Due to the subprime mortgage crisis).

Here's why:

The text states: ""2007-ee subprime mortgage sankater somei unmukto hoye paroi karone northern rokke thekiye rakhte hoyechilo."" This translates to ""In 2007, Northern Rock had to be kept afloat due to the subprime mortgage crisis."" This clearly indicates the crisis was the reason they needed government assistance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Banker jatiyakaraner pore** (After the bank was nationalized) - They needed help *before* nationalization.
*   **B: Sompod porichalon sanstha theke Bank alada howar por** (After the bank was separated from the asset management company) - This happened *after* the initial need for help.
*   **C: Virgin grouper bank kine neoyar pore** (After Virgin Group bought the bank) - Virgin bought the *good bank* much later, after nationalization and restructuring.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Banker jatiyakaraner purbe syara richarda bransoner virgin grouper bank adhigrahaner bid prottakhan koraa hoyechilo."" This translates to ""Before the bank was nationalized, Richard Branson's Virgin Group had offered a bid to acquire the bank.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Echharhao Virgin group Nordan rock er sompod porichalon sanstha ti kine niyechhilo** - The passage says Virgin Cable bought the 'good bank' (Northern Rock PLC), *not* the asset management company.
*   **B: Bank tir jatiyakaraner pore Virgin group setike kine niyechhilo** - The passage states Virgin bought the 'good bank', not the entire entity after nationalization.
*   **C: Mortgage sankater somei Virgin group bank k joruri sohayota offer korechhilo** - The passage says Northern Rock received help from the government, not Virgin, during the subprime mortgage crisis.



"
"Onuchchhede kora bornona onujayee, kioto jalbayu chukti swakkhorer pore kon deshti kkhotigrosto hoyechhe?","The correct answer is **A: Markin Juktorashtro (United States)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the US *separated itself* from the Kyoto Protocol after its ratification, becoming the only developed nation not to approve it. This means the US is the country that suffered a setback/became isolated (""khotigrosto"") after the Kyoto Protocol was finalized.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bharat (India):** The passage says India was *not bound* by emission targets, meaning they weren't negatively impacted by the protocol.
*   **C: Australier (Australia):** Australia initially refused to support Kyoto, but the passage indicates this was due to economic concerns about coal, not a direct consequence *of* the protocol itself being finalized.
*   **D: cheen (China):** Similar to India, China was not bound by emission targets and therefore wasn't negatively affected by the protocol.



"
Australier praktan sarkar kayoto anumodan kontir khoti korbe bole bhebechhilo?,"The correct answer is **C: koyla raftanir**.

Here's why:

The text states that the Australian conservative government refused to support Kyoto because it would be ""detrimental to its reliance on coal exports.""  This directly links their refusal to the economic impact on their coal industry.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Markin juktorashtro (United States of America):** The text states the US withdrew, but doesn't connect Australia's decision *to* the US withdrawal.
* **B: Deshtir orthonitite (The country's economy):** While the coal industry impacts the economy, the text specifically mentions *reliance on coal exports* as the problem.
* **D: Deshtir nirgomon lokkhomatrar (The country's emission targets):** The text doesn't mention emission targets as the reason for Australia's reluctance. It focuses on the economic impact of reducing coal exports.



"
Triale bandukbajder  kon kormosuchite niyog kora hoyechhilo?,"The correct answer is **D: Sporting shooters associationer shikar kormosuchite**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Npws ebong sporting shooters association off australia (nsw) inc er angshidaritte, **sporting shooters associationer shikar kormosuchite** jogyo swechchasebider niyog koraa hoyechilo."" (With the participation of NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., suitable volunteers were recruited for the **Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sporting shooters association off australia er kormosuchite** - Too broad. It's *specifically* the hunting program.
*   **B: park sanrakkhaner ebong oitijjobahi kormosuchite** - While NPWS (involved in park conservation and heritage) participated, the shooters were hired for the *Sporting Shooters Association's* program.
*   **C: Npws-er kormosuchite** -  NPWS participated, but didn't run the program themselves.



"
Kon bibriti ti kitpatanga niyantraner triale ke sothikvabe protipholito kore na?,"The correct answer is **A: Jehetu eti kormosuchi er prothom trial chhilo, tai eti mulyayan kora hoyni (Because this was the first trial of the program, it wasn't evaluated).**

Here's why:

The passage states the assessment of the program's effectiveness (""karjokarita mulyayan koraa hoyeche"" - its effectiveness was evaluated) *had* been done. This contradicts the statement that it wasn't evaluated.  The question asks which option *doesn't* reflect what the passage says.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with the text:

* **B: Shooter ra proshikkhoner nirdesh peyechhilen (The shooters received training instructions):**  The text explicitly says ""nirbachito chaar shooter onek beshi nirapatta ebong proshikkhoner nirdesh peyechilen"" (the selected four shooters received a lot of safety and training instructions).
* **C: Shooter der tottwabodhane chhilen ranger ra (The rangers were supervising the shooters):** The text states ""Sampurak kitpatanga niyantran triale bandukbajder rangers dwara ghonisthobhabe tottabodhan korte hobey"" (The entire pest control trial must be closely supervised by rangers with firearms).
* **D: Chaar jon shooter k nirbachito kora hoyechhilo (Four shooters were selected):** The text explicitly states ""prothom shooting operatione nirbachito chaar shooter"" (in the first shooting operation, selected four shooters).



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, bibhajanti kothay pawa gelo?","The correct answer is **B: Ekti jeebashme** (In a fossil).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ei jeebashmer upor vitti korey, setter maane holo bibhajanti anobik proman dwara prottashito somepor onek age hoy.""  This translates to: ""Based on this fossil, its meaning is that the split was much earlier than expected by previous estimates based on genetic evidence.""

Therefore, *bibhajanti* (the split/division) was found *upon* (or in) a *jeebashme* (fossil).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: rift bhaloey** - The passage mentions the Rift Valley, but it's where the research took place, not where the fossil was found.
*   **C: anobik proman** - This refers to ""genetic evidence,"" not the location where the fossil was found.
*   **D: Ithiopier** - This is the country where the Rift Valley is located, not the finding place of the fossil itself.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, konti prottasar cheye aage ghotechhe?","The correct answer is **A: jeebashmer abishkar (discovery of jeebashmer)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ei jeebashmer upor vitti korey, setter maane holo bibhajanti anobik proman dwara prottashito somepor onek age hoy."" This translates to: ""Based on this jeebashmer, it means the expected time of separation by geological evidence is much earlier."" 

This clearly indicates that research *on* jeebashmer is leading to a re-evaluation and advancement in understanding the timing of a separation event.  The other options are either components *of* the research (B & C) or a location of research (D) rather than what is progressing.



"
Ekti video game cholakalin nadachada korar jonno ekjon kheloader ki kora proyojon?,"The correct answer is **D: Controllerti bataser modhyo diye nadachada korte hobe** (The player has to move their body to control the controller).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ei jontroti batase nadachada korar madhyome ekjon kheloadke video gamermadhye tar criacollup oo chalachal niyantran korte debe."" This translates to ""Through body movement, a player must control their character's actions in the video game.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nishchito korte hobe je controllerty censor jeno consoleer kachhe obosthaan kore** (Ensure the controller censor is near the console) - While proximity is important, the *movement* is key.
*   **B: Segulik trivujer moto korey rakhte hobe** (They have to be kept in a triangular shape) - This describes the *setup* of the sensors, not what the player does.
*   **C: Sensorguli tader televisioner nikte bosate hobe** (The sensors have to be near their television) - Again, describes setup, not player action.



"
Televisioner remoteer moto dekhte ki naksha kora hoyechhilo?,"The correct answer is **B: 2 ti censor controller** (2 censor controller).

Here's why:

The passage states that the design involved a controller with 2 sensors. The controller was meant to look like television remotes. Therefore, the design was of a controller *with* 2 sensors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Controllertir 2 ti censor** (2 sensors of the controller) - This is part of the description, but doesn't represent the *shape* or design.
*   **C: mull uposthapona** (postponement) - This refers to the event where the design was revealed, not the design itself.
*   **D: Nintendo revolution console** - This is the name of the game console, not the design of the controller.



"
Jinghua sangbad sanstha sorboshesh report a ki bola hoyni?,"The correct answer is **A: Bimanti boma haamlar humki peyechhilo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Reporttite pore janano hoyechilo je bimanti bomar humki peyechilo..."" (The report later revealed that the hijacker had received a bomb threat...)

The question asks what wasn't in the *initial* reports from Jinghua News Agency. The passage states the initial reports mentioned the refusal of landing in Urumqi, the return to Afghanistan, and the landing in Kandahar. The bomb threat was revealed *later* in the reporting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bimanti urumqi-tee abotoron korechhilo** - The passage states the landing in Urumqi was *refused* initially.
*   **C: Bimantike afghanistane firie niye jaoa hoyechilo** - This was mentioned in the initial reports.
*   **D: Bimanti kandahare abataran korechhilo** - This was also mentioned in the initial reports."
Jinghua sangbad sanstha ar Prathomik reportgulite ki ullekh kora hoyni?,"The correct answer is **A: plane hijack kora hoyechhilo** (that the plane was hijacked).

Here's why:

The passage states that Jinghua news agency *received a report of a plane hijacking*. However, the question asks what wasn't mentioned in the initial reports. The passage explicitly says the initial reports talked about the refusal of emergency landing and the return to Afghanistan. It doesn't mention the hijacking itself being confirmed in those initial reports - only that a report *about* a hijacking was received.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bimanti joruri abotoron aswikar korechhilo** - The passage states this *was* mentioned in the initial reports.
*   **C: Bimantike afghanistane firie niye jaoa hoyechilo** - The passage states this *was* mentioned in the initial reports.
*   **D: Bimanti boma haamlar humki peyechhilo** - The passage states this *was* mentioned in the initial reports."

Here's why:

The passage states that Saraa Danias announced the committee had *given up trying to reach Bob Dylan* regarding the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature.  This directly translates to ""Komiti bob delaner sange jogajog korar procheshta tyag korechilo.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sahitye nobel puraskar bijoyier naam** - The passage doesn't mention the winner's name being announced at that time.
*   **B: Komiti sahojogider kachh thekey kono jobab payni** - Danias specifically says they *did* receive friendly responses from Dylan's associates.
*   **C: 2016 saale sahitye nobel puraskar jonno mononitoder naam** -  The passage doesn't mention any nominees.



"
Kar kachhe pouchano sombhob hoyni?,"The correct answer is **D: Bob delan**.

The passage explicitly states that the committee was unable to reach Bob Dylan to inform him about the Nobel Prize in Literature for 2016. They tried to contact him but gave up their attempts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bob delaner nikatatama sahojogi** - While they *did* contact Dylan's close associates, the passage states they couldn't reach *Dylan* himself.
*   **B: Saaraa danie** - Saaraa Danius is the one who *made* the announcement and tried to contact Dylan.
*   **C: Suidish academy** - The Swedish Academy *attempted* to contact Dylan.



"
K protishrutike “ekti boro podokkhep” bole montobyo korechhilen?,"The correct answer is **C: Gordon Johndro**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""busher mukhpatra gordon johndro uttor corrier ei protishrutike """"""""corian upodwipe jachaijoggo paromanobik nirostrikoron orjoner lakkhye ekti boro podokkhep"""""""" bole abhihito korechen."" 

This directly translates to: ""Bush's spokesperson Gordon Johndro announced this promise as """"""""a major undertaking aimed at eradicating human trafficking on the Korean peninsula.""""""""""

Therefore, Gordon Johndro is the one who referred to the promise as ""ekti boro podokkhep"" (a major undertaking)."
Slania bibhinno desher jonno kototi stamp utpadon korechhilen?,"The correct answer is **D: 1,000 er beshi (More than 1,000)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tini suiden ebong anyanno 28ti dasher jonno hajartir beshi stamp utpadon korechilen."" (He produced stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries.) and ""Tar 1,000 tom stampty chhilo 2000 saale david clacker ehrenstrahol rachito """"""""greet deeds bye suidish king"""""""". (He had 1,000 stamps in 2000 created by David Clacker Ehrenstrahol titled ""Greet Deeds Bye Swedish King"").

While the text mentions 1,000 stamps specifically related to one creation, it also states he produced *numerous* (hajartir beshi) stamps for 29 countries total. Therefore, the number is *more than* 1,000.
"
"Onuchchhed ouujaayee, tanker ventguli thekey kromagoto tell chuie porar sombhabyo karon ki?","The correct answer is **C: tapi samprasaranar**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Budhbar bikele, tapi samprasaranar foley tanker vitore futo toiri howar tanker ventguli thekey tell chuie padchila."" This directly translates to ""On Wednesday afternoon, due to heat expansion, pressure built up inside the tanker causing oil to leak from the tanker vents."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Madhyomik dharonkari sthaan dharon khomota onujayee vorti kora hochchhe** - The passage mentions the secondary containment area isn't full *yet*, not that it's being used and causing the leak.
* **B: Fire-command systemer niyomito porikkha** - The fire-command system test *caused* valves to open, leading to the initial spill, but not the later leaking from the tanker vents.
* **D: Fort grillyr ekti pump statione agnikando** - There's no mention of a fire at Fort Grilly pump station.



"
Relief valovguli keno khola rakha hoyechhilo?,"The correct answer is **B: Ekti system porikkhar korar pore bidyuter sangjog bichchhinno hoyechhilo** (Fire-command system porikkhar pore ekti bidyuter byarthotar foley relief valovguli khule jay).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the relief valves opened ""following a failure of electrical connectivity after the fire-command system check"" (Fire-command system porikkhar pore ekti bidyuter byarthotar foley relief valovguli khule jay).  This is the direct reason given for the valves opening.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tanker vitore tapi samprasaranar hoyechhilo** - While heat expansion *resulted* in oil leaking from the vents, it wasn't the reason the valves were initially opened.
* **C: Tankgulir sompurno dharon korte sokkhom chhilo** - The text states the secondary containment wasn't full, meaning the tanks weren't at full capacity.
* **D: Madhyomik dharonkhomota er sthanti jotheshto barrell dharon korte parto na** - The issue wasn’t a lack of capacity in the secondary containment *before* the valves opened; it was the valves opening due to an electrical failure.



"
"Bortomane, nobom wordti te joler ucchota koto?","The correct answer is **C: komor-unchu joley**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""kachher bandhti chhapi jaour bortomane komor-unchu joley royeche."" This directly translates to ""Currently, the water is waist-high near the broken dam.""  Therefore, the current water level at Nobom Wordti is waist-high.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 20 foot** - This was the height of the waves *during* Harikentir somoy (a time/event), not the current water level.
*   **B: 6 inch** - This refers to the predicted amount of rainfall.
*   **D: 100 foot** - This is the width of the area where water is gushing from the dam, not the water level.



"
Catarina namak harikentir somoy nobom wordti te ki hoyechhilo?,"The correct answer is **C: Bonna er joll 20 foot unchute chhilo** (The water rose 20 feet high).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Catarina namak harikentir somoy nobom wordti pray 20 foot unchute bonna vese jete dekha gichechilo"" which directly translates to ""During the Catarina hurricane, the water was seen rising about 20 feet high.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage mentions water spilling from a 100-foot wide area, it doesn't say the water *rose* from that area.
* **B:** The passage says the water *covered* the embankment up to waist-level, but this isn't what happened during the hurricane itself.
* **D:** This refers to predictions about collapsed dams, not what happened during the Catarina hurricane.



"
Nicher konti Hamilton thekey nischito bhabe janano hoyni?,"The correct answer is **A: Rogiti kothay bhromon korechhilen**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** The patient traveled to Nigeria, where there were several cases of Ebola. So we *do* know where the patient traveled.
* **The passage mentions:** The hospital is taking measures to prevent the spread of infection, implying they are concerned about other patients getting infected (B).
* **The passage states:** The hospital *is* following infection control protocols (C).
* **The passage states:** The patient is in a stable condition (D).

Therefore, the only piece of information that isn't definitively known from the passage is *specifically* where the patient traveled *within* Nigeria, or a detailed itinerary of their travels. However, the general location of Nigeria *is* known. Since the question asks what isn't *definitely* known, option A is the best answer.



"
Bigyanira nicher konti khunje ber korte chan?,"The correct answer is **D: Prithibi kibhabe gothito hoyechilo** (How the Earth was formed).

Here's why:

The passage states Bigyanira wants to understand ""kibhabe grohogulo gothito hoy, bishesh korey prithibi kibhabe gothito hoyechilo"" (how planets are formed, *especially* how Earth was formed). The entire context revolves around comets potentially delivering the building blocks of life to Earth, which directly relates to understanding Earth's formation process.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Prithibi er saathe dhumketugulo er kakhon sangharsha hoy (When did the comets collide with Earth):** While mentioned, this is a detail *within* the larger question of Earth's formation, not the primary focus.
*   **B: Protein gathon kibhabe hoy (How proteins are formed):**  This is mentioned as a result of the potential cometary delivery, but not what Bigyanira is actively trying to figure out.
*   **C: Joibo podartho ki (What are the living substances):** This refers to the potential life-giving materials comets might have brought, again, a consequence of the formation process, not the core question.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, sthaniyo pulisher bondho korar khetre ki bhumika rekhechhilo?","The correct answer is **A: Tara fbari-ke eti bondho korar anurodh korechhilo.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""taboo maryland poribohon kortripokkho fbari anurodhe eti bondho korey deyo"" which translates to ""the Maryland transportation department closed it at the request of fbari.""  This clearly indicates the police (implied by ""pulisher"") requested fbari to close it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tara bondho korar siddhanto niyechhilo** - The passage doesn't say the police *decided* to close it, only that it was closed *at the request* of fbari.
* **C: Tara gaari chalokder anno pothe pathanor nirdesh diyechhilo** - While they *assisted* in directing traffic (80 police officers helped), they didn't give the *instruction* to close the road.
* **D: Tara khabar diyechilo je bikalpa rasta te janjoter bilamber hocche** - The passage mentions traffic congestion on alternative routes, but doesn't state that the police reported this.

The text states: ""Tube probesher path bondho korte dump trackguli byabohar koraa hoyechilo"" - which translates to ""Dump trucks were used to block the tube probe's path"".  This directly implies the path was obstructed/blocked.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Segulike anno pothe hisebe byabohar kora hoyechhilo (They were used as alternative routes)** - The text doesn't suggest they were *used* as routes, only that they were used to *block* the route.
* **C: Seguli gaari chalokder jonno unmukto chhilo (They were free for drivers)** -  The opposite is true; they were blocked.
* **D: Sekhane vari janjoter cholachol korchhilo (There was heavy traffic there)** - The text doesn't mention anything about traffic, just the blocking of the path.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, photographerke gaarir aghat koraa aage ki ghoteni?","The correct answer is **C: Photographer ekti pulish stop er photo tulechhilen** (Photographer took a photo of a police stop).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Binodan somporkito news website tmj bujhte pereche je chitrosangbadik tar gaditi sepulveda bullevarder onnoprante thamiye rasta periye pulish stop er photo tulte gele ebong abirata thakle..."" This directly translates to ""News website tmj understood that the photographer stopped his car near Sepulveda Boulevard, crossed the road to take a photo of a police stop and stayed there...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Haioye petrol photographerke rasta paar hoye ferat pathanor nirdesh diyechilen** (Highway patrol directed the photographer to cross the road and return) - This is a *result* of him taking the photo, not what happened *before*.
*   **B: Chitrosangbadik tar gaditi sepulveda bullevarder sojasuji park korechhilen** (The photographer parked his car straight on Sepulveda Boulevard) - The passage says he parked *near* Sepulveda Boulevard, but doesn't state it was directly on the boulevard or ""straight.""
*   **D: Photographer pulish stop er ekti photo tulte perechhilen** (Photographer was able to take a photo of a police stop) - This is true, but the question asks what happened *before* anything else, and the fact he *took* the photo is the key initial action.



"
Gaarir aghat er aage ekjon photographer ki korar cheshta korchhilen?,"The correct answer is **B: Ekti pulish stop er photo tulechhilen** (He was taking a photo of a police stop).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Binodan somporkito news website tmj bujhte pereche je chitrosangbadik tar gaditi sepulveda bullevarder onnoprante thamiye rasta periye pulish stop er photo tulte gele ebong abirata thakle..."" 

This translates to: ""Entertainment news website tmj understands that the photographer parked his car near Sepulveda Boulevard, crossed the road to take a photo of a police stop, and stayed there continuously...""

Therefore, the photographer was attempting to take a photo of a police stop before the accident.



"
Kon bibriti viruser porikkhay positive howar pore Rashtropotir abostha sothikvabe bornona kore na?,"The correct answer is **A: Tini valo onubhob korchhen na (He is not feeling well)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...jwar ebong gola byatha chhara, aami phone kotha bolar madhyome amar kaajti sampadan korte valo onubhob korchi."" (Apart from fever and sore throat, I am feeling well enough to carry out my duties over the phone.) This *directly* contradicts the idea that he's feeling well. He's specifically stating he's feeling well *despite* the symptoms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tar gola byatha achhe (He has a sore throat):** The passage explicitly mentions he has a sore throat (""gola byatha"").
* **C: Taar abostha sthitishil (His condition is stable):** The passage states ""Rashtropotir abostha sthitishil"" (The President's condition is stable).
* **D: Tar jwar hoyechhe (He has a fever):** The passage states he has a fever (""jwar"").



"
"Onuchchhed ti onujayee, Rashtropotir prosonge nicher kon bibriti ti sotyo?","The correct answer is **C: Tini phone kotha bolar madhyome valo onubhob korchen** (He is having a good experience completing his work through phone calls).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""jwar ebong gola byatha chhara, aami phone kotha bolar madhyome amar kaajti sampadan korte valo onubhob korchi."" (Apart from fever and sore throat, I am having a good experience completing my work through phone calls.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tar jwar nei (He has no fever):** The passage specifically mentions ""jwar ebong gola byatha"" (fever and sore throat), so he *does* have a fever.
* **B: Tini koyek soptaho barite thakben (He will stay home for several weeks):** The passage says he will isolate ""barite besh koyekdiner jonno"" (at home for a few days), not weeks.
* **D: Tini probolvabe viruser akranto hoyechhen (He is severely infected with the virus):** The passage states his condition is ""sthitishil"" (stable), suggesting it's not severe.  It only mentions mild symptoms like fever and sore throat.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ajke diner prothom dike bataser begg pray 83 kimmy/ghanta chhilo ebong kromoshoi eti durbal hobey bole aasha koraa hoyechilo.""  This directly translates to ""Today, at first, the wind speed was about 83 km/h and it was hoped that it would weaken gradually.""

Therefore, the expectation of weakening began *when* the wind speed was 83 km/h.



"
Krantiya ghurnijhad gonu-r teebrotar somoy jhorher gotibeg koto chhilo?,"The correct answer is **A: proti ghanta 149 kilometer**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""tar sorbochcho abostha batas ghanta 240 kilometre (proti ghanta 149 mail) pouchechilo."" This translates to ""its highest state, the wind speed reached 240 kilometers (149 miles per hour).""
* The question asks for the wind speed *at its strongest*.
* While 240 kilometers per hour is mentioned, the equivalent in kilometers per hour (149) is also provided within the same phrase.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer directly stated in the text.
"
Nicher konti Kerenia bravis er boishishtyo hisabe bibechito hoi na?,"The correct answer is **C: Eti bohukoshi** (It is multicellular).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ei algira ekti neurotoxin utpadon korey jaa manoos ebong mach ubhoiyeri snayu akkham korte paare."" (This algae produces a neurotoxin that can affect the nervous systems of humans and fish.)  ""Algira"" means algae, which are *single-celled* or simple *multicellular* organisms.
* **The passage does NOT say Kerenia bravis is multicellular.** It simply identifies it *as* an algae.  The passage focuses on its harmful effects, not its cellular structure.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned in the passage:

* **A: Eti ek prokarer algira** (It is a type of algae) - Directly stated in the text.
* **B: Eti manoos er snayu ke akkham korte pare** (It can affect the human nervous system) - The passage specifically mentions the neurotoxin affecting human and fish nerves.
* **D: Eti Prakritik bhabei ghote** (It occurs naturally) - The passage mentions ""Prakritik karonguli"" (natural factors) contributing to its blooms.



"
Kerenia bravis nicher konti korte akkham?,"The correct answer is **D: Ekti neurotoxin utpadon kora** (Producing a neurotoxin).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ei algira ekti neurotoxin utpadon korey jaa manoos ebong mach ubhoiyeri snayu akkham korte paare."" (This algae produces a neurotoxin that can affect the nervous systems of humans and fish).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mach er snayu akkham kore deoya** (Affecting the nerves of fish) - While it *can* affect fish nerves, the passage says it affects both humans *and* fish.  The neurotoxin production is the primary action.
*   **B: Je kono obosthatei sankhyay druto briddhi paoya** (Rapidly increasing in numbers in any situation) - The passage states natural conditions *can* hinder ideal conditions for growth, meaning it doesn't always rapidly increase.
*   **C: joll ke probhabito kora** (Infecting water) - The passage says it's *carried* by water, but doesn't say it ""infects"" it. It's the presence of the algae and its neurotoxin that causes the problem.



"
"Onuchchhed ti onujayee, nicher konti harricane felicica er pholaphol hisabe ghoteni?","The correct answer is **D: Rastay joll jome jawa** (Burning and going up in flames).

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Safir-simpson harricane scale porimapojoggo, felicica naamer ekti 4 bibhagi jhojh mangalbar adrishya howar agei krantari anchale ese durbal hoye pechivala."" (Hurricane Felicia, a Category 4 storm, weakened as it moved inland on Tuesday before dissipating). It also mentions rainfall and lightning.
*   **The passage describes:** heavy rainfall (""brishtipat, ohur upor ekti goje 6.34 inch pouche""), and occasional lightning (""Kokhonokokhono brishtipater saathe jhojh ebong ghono ghono bajrapat hoy."").
*   **Options A, B, and C** are all directly mentioned or implied by the passage:
    *   **A: Upokari brishtipat** - ""upokari hisabe bornonakra hoyechilo"" (described as beneficial rainfall).
    *   **B: Bajrapat soho brishtipat** - (Lightning with rainfall) - explicitly stated.
    *   **C: Ghono ghono bajrapat** - (Frequent lightning) - explicitly stated.
*   **Option D: Rastay joll jome jawa** - (Burning and going up in flames) is *not* mentioned anywhere in the passage. Hurricanes do not cause things to spontaneously combust.

Therefore, burning and going up in flames is not a consequence of Hurricane Felicia described in the given text."
Harricane felicica somporke kon bibriti ti mithya?,"The correct answer is **A: Er karone howa brishtipat Ohur upokar korechhe** (The rainfall caused by it has benefitted Ohio).

Here's why:

* **The passage states the rainfall of 6.34 inches was described as ""upokari"" (beneficial) as a *warning*, not as something that actually benefitted Ohio.** It was a forecast, a prediction of the amount of rain expected, not a statement about positive outcomes. The passage doesn't say Ohio *was* benefitted, only that the rainfall was *described* as beneficial in a warning.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

* **B: 4 bibhagi jhojh -e porinoto howar aage etike prothom krantari nimnochhap hisabe shreniboddho kora hoyechhilo** (Before becoming a Category 4 hurricane, it was classified as a tropical depression.) - This is directly stated in the passage.
* **C: Beshirbhaag deeper odhikangsho elaka te brishtipat hoyechhe** (Most of the rainfall occurred in the deeper inland areas.) - The passage says the remnants caused rainfall over ""deeper odhikangsho elaka"".
* **D: Bajrapat soho kichhu brishtipat hoyechhe** (There was some rainfall along with lightning.) - The passage states ""kokhono kokhono brishtipater saathe jhojh ebong ghono ghono bajrapat hoy"" (Sometimes there were squalls with heavy lightning along with the rain).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""2009 saaler hangerian grand prixer pore paikit juniyarke podochyuto koraa hoyechilo"" - which directly translates to ""After the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, Piquet Junior was demoted.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fernando alonso ekti durghotonay joriye poren** (Fernando Alonso was involved in an accident) - The passage doesn't mention Alonso being in an accident in 2009 Hungary.
*   **B: Picket junior joylabh korechhilen** (Piquet Junior had won) - The passage doesn't mention Piquet Junior winning.
*   **D: safety car ti durghotonar kobole porechhilo** (The safety car fell due to the accident) - The passage doesn't state that the safety car *fell* or was impacted by an accident; it describes its deployment.

The text explicitly states: ""2008 singapur grain pri-tee fernando alonso **peat stop neoar ektu porei** picket junior krayasha koren..."" which translates to ""In the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, Fernando Alonso crashed **shortly after the pit stop**...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jakhon onnyanyo kaar jalani bhorchhilo** - While cars were burning, the text doesn't say this *caused* the crash.
*   **C: safety carer ber howar aagei** - The text says the safety car came out *because* of the crash, not before it.
*   **D: Picket jalanir jonno jaoyar pore** - The crash happened *after* Alonso's pit stop, not after he was preparing to rejoin the race.

Here's why:

The passage states the researchers found the new species evolved within *only two generations*. They also mention it was thought to take much *longer* due to cross-breeding with other finches. This directly relates to how long they initially believed it would take for the *species to form* (projatiti-r gathon).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: projatiti -r somporke janiyechen** (learned about the species) - The passage talks about *discovering* the speed of evolution, not simply learning *about* the species.
* **C: Bibhinno projatiti -r modhye projononer karone** (due to breeding between different species) - This is a *reason* why they thought it would take longer, but not what the question is asking about. The question asks what they underestimated the *time* for.
* **D: Projatiti guli bibortito hoyeche** (the species have evolved) - This is a statement of fact from the passage but doesn’t address the time it took, which is the core of the question.



"
Nicher konti gobeshokra janan ni?,"The correct answer is **A: Notun projatiti guli kothay gathon hoyechhilo** (Where the new species were found).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the new species was found on the **Galapagos Islands** (""Ecuedoriyo gallopegos dweeppunjer...""). This is a direct piece of information provided in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: bibortito prokriyati doirghyo** (Duration of the evolutionary process) - The passage mentions the process *could* take longer with other finches, but doesn't give a specific duration. It only says it *might* be longer.
* **C: Notun projatiti gulir naam** (Names of the new species) - The passage doesn't state the *names* of the new species, only that it's a new bird species.
* **D: Projononer sathe jorito pakhir naam** (Names of birds involved in reproduction) - The passage mentions Darwin's finches, *Geospiza fortis*, and immigrant cactus finches, but these are examples of birds involved in *other* evolutionary processes, not necessarily the new species specifically.



"
coupreder kothay onushthito hobe?,"The correct answer is **B: bookerest city te**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that Bucharest will be the first city in Southeast Europe to host the ""coupreder"" event in June and August. Therefore, it will be held in Bucharest.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bibhinno romanifan shohor -e (In various Romanian cities):** The text only mentions Bucharest.
*   **C: Sompurno Dakkhin-purbo europer moddhye (Throughout Southeast Europe):** While Bucharest is *in* Southeast Europe, the event is being *held in* Bucharest, not spread across the entire region.
*   **D: Europer bibhinno rajdhanir shohor -e (In various European capital cities):** The text specifies Southeast Europe, and Bucharest is the first city to host it.



"
Nicher kon bibriti coupreder sothikvabe bornona kore?,"The correct answer is **D: Eti bishwer brihottomo public art event**

Here's why:

* **P** explicitly states: ""...ei bochor june ebong auguster modhye bishwer brihottomo public art event coupreder aojon hobey."" (This year, between June and August, the world's largest public art event Coupreder will be organized.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eti shudhumatro “srijanshil” hisebe bibechito shohor gulite ayojito hoi** - The passage doesn't say it's *only* held in creative cities. It mentions Bucharest as the host.
* **B: Eti bookerest city holler dwara toiri hoyechhilo** - While Bucharest is organizing it, the passage doesn't say the *event itself* was created *by* Bucharest.
* **C: Eti holo sompurno Dakkhin-purbo europer moddhye greeshme onushthito howa ekti art event** - The passage says it will be the first city in Southeastern Europe to host it, not that it's held *throughout* Southeastern Europe.

Ki karone Russia il-76 -er byabohar sthogito korechhilo?,"The correct answer is **B: Ekti durghotona** (An accident).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Seii durghotonar por rashia alpokkhoner jonno il-76s key nami aane."" which translates to ""After that accident, Russia temporarily grounded the IL-76s.""  This directly links the grounding of the IL-76s to an accident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Abhyantarin sena** (Engineering Army) - While the army was involved in the investigation, it wasn't the *reason* for grounding the planes.
*   **C: Soviet samrik bahini** (Soviet military) - The Soviet military's use of the plane isn't why Russia grounded it.
*   **D: Ekti multubi thaaka todonto** (A multi-story investigation) - The investigation happened *after* the accident, it wasn't the cause of grounding the planes.



"
il-76 ki?,"The correct answer is **C: Ekti biman** (An airplane).

Here's why:

The text states ""1970 er doshok thekey il-76 russian ebong soviet ubhayi samrik bahinir ekti pradhan ongsho ebong eri modhye russia goto masse eti ekti gurutoro durghotona dekha jaa."" and ""rashia alpokkhoner jonno il-76s key nami aane."" This clearly indicates that IL-76 is a type of aircraft, as it's mentioned in the context of flying and accidents related to engines. The text also describes an engine separating during flight, which is characteristic of an airplane.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ekti dubojahaj** (A submarine) - Submarines operate underwater, not in the air.
*   **B: Ekti tank** (A tank) - Tanks are armored vehicles used on land.
*   **D: Ekti train** (A train) - Trains run on rails.



"

The text states: ""1989 saale Tini brooks ebong groninger saathe simpsons toirite sahajyo korechilen ebong shoyer prothom lekhok doler niyoger jonno dattoprapto hoyechilen."" This translates to: ""In 1989, he helped create The Simpsons with Brooks and Groninger and was appointed for the first writer team's employment.""

Therefore, Brooks was involved in hiring the first writer team for The Simpsons."
"Fluke er mote, k taake itibachak montobbo ebong utsaho diyechhilo?","The correct answer is **D: Naarii ebong purush**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...itiachak montobbo ebong utsaho pathano take naarii ebong purush ubhoy bektir dwara."" This directly translates to ""both women and men gave him respectful attention and encouragement.""

Therefore, Fluke received respectful attention and encouragement from both women and men."
"Onuchcheed onujayee, Kichhu lok mohiladerkon bishoye kotha bola mene nite chaan na?","The correct answer is **C: Mohilader swasther niye** (Regarding women's health).

**Explanation:**

The passage (P) states that Fluke believed some locker room discussions about women's health were inappropriate. The core issue is about conversations concerning women's health and whether they were being held in an unsuitable setting. The question (Q) asks what some people don't want to talk about regarding women. Therefore, the most logical answer is women's health itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Purush byaktider niye** (About men) - The passage focuses on discussions *about* women, not men.
*   **B: Chikitsa -er kharoch niye** (About the cost of treatment) - The passage mentions contraception as a medical necessity, but doesn't center around the *cost* of treatment.
*   **D: Fluke** - The question is about the *topic* of conversation, not about Fluke herself.



"
"Onuccheed onujayee, kon  groho ti sob cheye gotimota prodorshon korey?","The correct answer is **A: Prithibi**.

The passage states: ""Jotodur amra jaani, ekhane shudhumatra ektiyi groho achhe jaa titaner tulonay beshi gotimota prodorshon korey, ebong er name holo prithibi,"" which translates to ""As far as we know, there is only one planet here that exhibits greater density than Titan, and its name is Earth.""
"
Kon groho te swachcho torol bhora nodee ebong hrod shonakto kora hoyechhe?,"The correct answer is **B: Titaner**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*joler motoi swachcho eti.* Sutorang apni jodi upokuler paashe daani thaken tobe nicer ongsher jaa kichhu nuig pathar baa toral chotchote vastu chhilo tha dekhte paben."" ( ""...it's as clean as water. So if you were near the shore, you would see small stones or pebbles on the lower part."").  This describes a clean surface with stones and pebbles, implying rivers and lakes.  The passage then says this is observed on Titan: ""...*ekti groho achhe jaa titaner tulonay beshi gotimota prodorshon korey...*” ( ""...only one planet exhibits heavier features compared to Titan...""). 

Therefore, Titan is the planet with clean rivers and lakes (filled with pebbles).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Brihospoti (Jupiter):** Jupiter is a gas giant and doesn't have a solid surface for rivers or lakes.
*   **C: Surjyo (Sun):** The Sun is a star, made of plasma, and obviously doesn't have rivers or lakes.
*   **D: Shoni (Saturn):** While Saturn has moons with potential for liquid, the passage specifically connects the described features to Titan.



"
Ei onusondhan gulir modhye konti palak abishkarer pholaphol noi?,"The correct answer is **D: Nishchitokoron je beshirbhag dinosaurer palak chhilo** (Determining that most dinosaurs had feathers).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""P: Eti shudhumatra kompokkhe kichhu dinosaurer palak chhilo tha nischitoi korey naa..."" (P: It's certainly not confirmed that only a few dinosaurs had feathers...). This means the research *hasn't* definitively established that most dinosaurs had feathers.  It's an ongoing area of investigation, but a conclusion hasn't been reached.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pranitir paloker rong** (The color of the creature's feathers): The passage mentions scientists believe the feathers were brownish on top and reddish/carrot-colored underneath.
*   **B: Uraar jonno palak byabohar koraa hoyney seti bojha** (Understanding that feathers weren't used for flight): The passage discusses the idea that feathers may have been for temperature regulation or display, not flight.
*   **C: Paloker bibortoner  bishoye Anusandhanti** (Research on feather evolution): The passage describes research into how feather structure might have evolved.



"
Dinosaurer palak -e ki chhilo na?,"The correct answer is **A: Sukkho kaanta** (Dry quills/barbs).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""gobeshokra anuman korchen je khub sombhoboto bibortoner unnoti sadhoner foley porobortite jesob baisishtya prakash paay rachis tar ekti. Paloker kathamo dharona daay je eguli uraar jonno byabohar koraa hoyne borong tapmatra niyantran baa prodorshonir jonno byabohar koraa hoyechilo."" This translates to: ""Researchers speculate that some characteristics evolved for display, and the structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flight but for temperature regulation or display."" Furthermore, the text mentions ""kaanta oo sukkho kaanta"" - meaning barbs and *dry* barbs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ekti Rachis:** The text states dinosaurs *didn't* have well-formed rachis (central shaft of a feather).
*   **C: Porinato palak:** The text doesn't say the feathers were complete or fully developed. In fact, it suggests they were from a young dinosaur, with parts missing.
*   **D: Nicher dike rong phaycase:** While the text mentions color gradients (""badami borner ebong bhitorer rong phaycase baa Carotener moto"" - almond color and interior color like phycocyanin or carotene), it doesn't state that dry quills were specifically lower in color.



"
ZMapp somporke nicher kon bibrititi sotyo noi?,"The correct answer is **B: Eti uposthit sankramaner chikitsar korte sokkhom kintu mrityu rodh korte parbe na**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while ZMapp *initially* showed promise, research indicates it's **less effective at preventing death** than originally thought. It doesn't say it *can* treat existing infections, only that its benefit is limited.  The passage implies it wasn't very useful even for treatment.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Eti antibody diye toiri** - The passage explicitly states ""ZMapp naame ekti antibody mishran"" (ZMapp is a mixture of antibodies).
*   **C: Eti PALM porikkhai ekti niyantrak hisabe kaaj korechilo** - The passage says ""PALM porikkhai ZMapp ekti niyantrak hisabe kaaj korechilo"" (In the PALM trial, ZMapp acted as a control).
*   **D: Gobeshonai dekha jaay je er subidhaguli prothome ja protishruti dekhiyechilo tar cheye cheye kom upokari** - The passage states ""gobeshonai ingit paoa geche jee, eti mrityu rodh korar cheye kom upokari"" (research suggests it's less effective than originally promised).

This directly translates to: ""The PALM trial used ZMapp as a control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared it with three other treatments.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage states ZMapp is *less* useful than initially thought, not *more* useful.
* **C:** While ZMapp was used as a baseline, the trial *compared* it to others, it wasn't simply the baseline for the whole experiment.
* **D:** The passage states no drug is *effectively* proven for treating existing Ebola infections.

The text explicitly states that the researchers believe the chip will be particularly useful for detecting diseases like Cancer, stroke, HIV, and Malaria in **low-income countries**, where survival rates for diseases like breast cancer are significantly lower than in wealthier nations. The other options are not the primary focus of the research's potential impact as described in the passage."
Rog nirnayer jantra toiri korte kon poddhoti byabohar kora hobe?,"The correct answer is **B: Maansampannaa Inkjet Printer**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the device is ""tayri karaa jete paare"" (can be made) using a ""Maansampannaa Inkjet Printer"" (a human-powered Inkjet Printer). While a ""mudranjogya chip"" (printable chip) is *part* of the device, the printer is the *tool* used to create it. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Praayy Markin ek Cent (Approximately one US Cent):** This refers to the *cost* of the chip, not the method of making it.
*   **C: Mudranjogya chip (Printable chip):** This is the *result* of the process, not the process itself.
*   **D: Onnyanyo rog nirnayer jantra (Other diagnostic tools):** The passage is specifically about this *new* diagnostic tool.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, Lobet Scarp somporke kon bibriti ti sotyo noy?","The correct answer is **D: Chaander uporibhag jure seguli khub beshi porimane pawa jayni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""এই খানরা অংশগুলো সমগ্র চাঁদ জুড়ে পাওয়া গিয়েছিল"" which translates to ""These features were found all over the moon.""  Option D contradicts this directly by saying they weren't found in large quantities.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Je ghotonar pholey eguli srishti hoyechhe ta motamuti samprotik chhilo** - The passage states ""taader bhutattik ghotonaguli motamuti samprotik chhilo"" (""their geological events were mostly recent"").
* **B: Egulir uposthiti maane holo chande  bhutattik kriyakalapgulir obhab nei** - The passage explicitly says the features disprove the idea that the moon is geologically inactive.
* **C: Eguli chaander sankuchito howar pholey dekha diyeche** - The passage states they ""dekha diyeche chand khub dhire dhire sankuchito howar pholey"" (""show that the moon is slowly shrinking"").



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, maatir gathon somporkito kon tottwo ti nirdesh kore je chaande bhutattik kriyakalapguli ghotchhe?","The correct answer is **D: Maatir gathon guli samprotik srishti hoyechhe**.

Here's why:

The passage states the formations (Lobet Scarps) are ""khubi kom khoyprapto dekhai jaa ingit daai je taader bhutattik ghotonaguli motamuti samprotik chhilo"" which translates to ""relatively few in number and appear to indicate that their geological events were mostly recent"".  This directly supports the idea that the formations are recently created, implying ongoing geological activity on the moon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Chaander khub dhire dhire sankuchito hochchhe (The moon is shrinking slowly)** - While the passage mentions shrinking, it's presented as *evidence* of activity, not the activity itself. It doesn't tell us *what* kind of activity is happening.
* **B: Maatir gathon guli onek aagei toiri hoyechhilo (The formations were created a long time ago)** - This is the opposite of what the passage suggests.
* **C: Chaander uporibhag jure maatir gathon ekti nyunotomo porimane royechhe (A minimal amount of formations remain on the moon's surface)** - The passage states they are found ""samasta chand jure"" (throughout the moon), not in minimal amounts.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, Abhijog na howa porjonto ar ki ki thakbe na?","The correct answer is **C: Prottokhodorshir kono proman niye alochona** (Discussion of any evidence).

Here's why:

The passage states that the Crown Officer has warned journalists *not to comment on any evidence* until the case is concluded. This is because widespread publication of images could prejudice a potential jury in the Scottish legal system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aro montobbo (More attention):** The passage implies the opposite – less attention is desired.
*   **B: Chhobi prochar koraa (Image publication):** The court already views image publication negatively. The warning is about *further* actions.
*   **D: Probondho prokashona (Document publication):** While related to evidence, the specific warning is about commenting on the evidence itself.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, silarder jonno konti ekti bortoman somosya noi?","The correct answer is **D: Gole jachchhe emon Baraf** (Melting ice).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Baraf churno chharao, kharap abhawa poristhiti uddharer procheshtake byahoto korey choleche."" (Ice is melting, efforts to improve the bad weather situation are continuing.) and ""icepacker poriman oo ghonotto silarder jonno goto15 bochore sabcheye kharap."" (The amount of ice and the shrinking glaciers are the worst for the glaciers in the last 15 years).
* **A: Kharap abhawa poristhitii (Bad weather situation)** - The passage explicitly mentions this as a problem.
* **B: Baraf er poriman (Amount of ice)** - The passage states the *amount* of ice is a problem (""icepacker poriman...sabcheye kharap"").
* **C: Baraf er ghonotto (Shrinking ice)** - The passage mentions glaciers *shrinking* (""ghonotto silarder jonno"").
* **D: Gole jachchhe emon Baraf (Melting ice)** - While the passage *implies* the ice is melting (because it says it's *churno chharao* - melting), it doesn't explicitly state that melting ice *is* the problem. It states the melting is *happening* and the reduced amount and shrinking are the issues.

Therefore, melting ice itself isn't presented as a distinct problem in the passage - it's a *result* of the problems of low ice volume and glacier shrinkage.



"
"Baraf chharao, ki ki poristhiti uddharer procheshtake byahoto korey choleche?","The correct answer is **D: Silarder (Roads)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Pitmaner mote, icepacker poriman oo ghonotto silarder jonno goto15 bochore sabcheye kharap."" which translates to ""Pitman thinks, the amount of ice accumulation is the worst in 15 years for the roads."" This directly links the bad weather and efforts to alleviate the situation to the condition of the roads.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sorboraher obhab (Lack of supplies):** The passage doesn't mention a lack of supplies.
*   **B: Abhawa er abostha (Weather conditions):** While the weather is the *cause* of the problems, the question asks what is *affected* by the rescue efforts.
*   **C: Sahajyer obhab (Lack of help):** The passage doesn't mention a lack of help.



"
Roberts kon biswas jachai kora thekey biroto chhilen?,"The correct answer is **A: Maamlar niye alochonar noitikota (The ethics of discussing the matter)**.

Here's why:

The text states Roberts ""bolechilen je sombhabbo maamlar sunirdishto bishoye montobbo koraa anoitik hobe"" - meaning he refused to speak about the case, believing it would be unethical to offer an opinion on specific aspects of it.  He was against *discussing* the ethics of the matter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Supreme Courter dharabahik raayer tatporjo (The consequences of the Supreme Court's continuous rulings)** - While the text mentions the Supreme Court's support for *Roe v. Wade*, Roberts' refusal wasn't about the rulings themselves, but about commenting on the case.
*   **C: Jiboner shuru (The beginning of life)** - The text touches on this, but Roberts' refusal was about *talking* about the issue, not his personal belief about when life begins.
*   **D: Goponiyatar adhikare (The right to privacy)** -  Roberts *believed* in the right to privacy inherent in Roe, but his initial refusal to comment wasn't *about* that right itself, but the ethics of discussing the case.



"
Roberts kon bishoye montobbo koraa anoitik bole mone korechhilen?,"The correct answer is **D: Maamlar sunirdishto bishoye** (Specific matters of the case).

Here's why:

The text states Roberts ""bolechilen je sombhabbo maamlar sunirdishto bishoye montobbo koraa anoitik hobe"" - meaning he believed forming opinions on *specific matters of the case* would be unethical.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Supreme Courter rayer dharabahikota (The consistency of Supreme Court rulings)** - While mentioned in the passage, it's not what Roberts considered unethical to form an opinion on.
* **B: Roe V. Wade er siddhanto (The principle of Roe V. Wade)** - He had opinions *about* Roe v. Wade, but didn't refuse to comment on the principle itself.
* **C: Goponiyatar antarnihito adhikare (The inherent right to privacy)** - He believed Roe was based on this, but again, didn't avoid discussing the concept.



"
Alor roshmi duti kothay jwolchhe?,"The correct answer is **A: Akasher dike** (Towards the sky).

The text explicitly states: ""Ratarati duti alokrashmi **akasher dike taak korey karjopojogi koraa hoyeche**"" which translates to ""At night, two beams of light are directed **towards the sky** and made functional."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shohor jure** (Throughout the city) - The text mentions a stillness *over the city*, but doesn't say the lights are shining throughout it.
* **C: Prothom jettie lokkhobostuke** (At the first jet landing site) - This is where the event of recognizing the time of the first landing occurred, but doesn't relate to the lights.
* **D: Smriti uddan er modhyosthane** (In the middle of the memorial garden) -  Construction is happening near the transport hub and memorial garden, but the lights aren't *in* the garden.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, oi saittite gaganchumbi attalikar kakhon nirman kora hocchhe?","The correct answer is **D: Nirman kaaj cholche** (Construction is ongoing).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Modhyosthane ekti poribohon kendra ebong smriti uddan soho saittite panchti notun gaganchumbi attalikar **nirman kaaj cholche**."" This directly translates to ""In the middle, along with a transport hub and a memorial garden, construction of seven new skyscrapers is **ongoing**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Diner majhamajhi somoye** (Around midday) - The passage doesn't mention a specific time of day for the construction.
*   **B: Sokal 8ta 46er somoy** (At 8:46 in the morning) - This time is mentioned in relation to a moment of silence, not the construction.
*   **C: Ratarati** (At night) - While lights are mentioned at night, the passage doesn't state the construction happens *at* night.



"
Kon tathya theke bojha jay je The Seven Sisters holo guhar?,"The correct answer is **A: Tapmatrar boichitro (Temperature variations)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Infrared images show that rate oo dine tapmatrar boichitro royechhe taa dekhte guhar moto"" - which translates to ""Infrared images show temperature variations that look like caves."" This directly links the temperature patterns to the characteristic of caves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Guhar probeshpothoguli bayas (Diameter of the cave entrances):** While the passage mentions the diameters, this doesn't *prove* they are caves, just describes a characteristic.
*   **C: Geological survey (Geological survey):** This refers to who conducted the research, not a characteristic of the formations themselves.
*   **D: Prithibir brihottor guhagulir (Largest caves in the world):**  The passage compares their thermal behavior *to* large caves, but doesn't state they *are* those caves.



"
Seven Sister er tapiya acharan kivabe prorjobekkhon kora hoy?,"The correct answer is **B: sthalobhager govir gorter sahajye**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Markin Juktorashtrer Geological survey (usgs) jyotirbigyan doll ebong Arijonar flangstaffe abosthito uttor Arijona bishwabidyalayer Glen Kushing bolechen """"""""taader tapiya acharan prithibir brihottor guhagulir moto sthir noy jaa prayashai sthir tapmatra bojay rakhe, kintu eti **sthalobhager govir gorter saathe samanjasyapurna**"""""""".

This directly translates to ""their thermal behavior is not like the larger caves of the world which maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it **is in harmony with the geological formation of the area**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Infrared chitroguli dekhay** (Infrared images show) - Infrared images *reveal* the temperature differences, but don't *explain* the behavior.
*   **C: Guhar bayas diye** (By the cave's diameter) - The diameter is mentioned as a characteristic, not how behavior is observed.
*   **D: Prithibir onnyanyo guhar survey er sahajye** (By surveying other caves in the world) - The passage specifically states the Seven Sisters behave *differently* than other caves, making this incorrect.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, sondehojonok somporke kon bibrititi sotyo noi?","The correct answer is **D: Tar kono jakham lageni**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Boma bishforoner sange jukto sondehojonok bektike jakham abosthay atok koraa hoyeche"" which translates to ""The suspect involved in the bombing has been detained with injuries."" This directly contradicts option D, which states he has no injuries.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

*   **A: Se akromoner somoy ekti gaarike byabohar korechhilo** - The passage states ""Lokti ekti bishforokvorti tin chaakar gaarike veerer modhye niye jaai bole abhijog koraa hoyeche"" which means ""It is alleged that the person carried a bomb in a car.""
*   **B: Tini bishphoroker sahajye bishforoner ghotan bole abhijog** - The passage says the person is a suspect *linked to* the bombing.
*   **C: Kortripokkhora tar jatisottwa somporke janen** - The passage states ""shudhu etaa jaane je seey Uighur ethnic doler ekjon sadasya"" which means ""it is only known that he is a member of the Uighur ethnic group."" So, the authorities *do* know his ethnicity.



"
Kortripokkhora Hamlar bishoye kon bishoyti nishchhito korechhe?,"The correct answer is **B: Sondehojonok bektir jatisattwa** (The suspect's ethnicity).

Here's why:

The text states, ""Kortripokkhora ekhono taar naam jaane naa, shudhu etaa jaane je seey Uighur ethnic doler ekjon sadasya."" This translates to ""The court still doesn't know his name, only that he is a member of the Uighur ethnic group.""

Therefore, the court has definitively established the suspect's ethnicity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Je kono sohojogir porichoy** (The identity of any accomplice) - The text doesn't mention any accomplices.
*   **C: Hamlatir pichhoner obhisondhi** (The motive behind the attack) - The text doesn't discuss the motive.
*   **D: Sondehojonok bektir prothom o shesh naam** (The suspect's first and last name) - The text specifically states the court *doesn't* know the suspect's name.



"
Ellis parke matche kon dol khelbe?,"The correct answer is **C: Dakkhin Africa ebong Australia**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Jokhon springbox Australia khelbe, sirijer shes matchti porer saptahe johannesburger ellis parke hobey."" 

* ""Springbox"" refers to the South African rugby team.
* This means South Africa will play Australia at Ellis Park.



"
Sspringbox tader poroborti match kothay khelbe?,"The correct answer is **C: johannesburger**.

The text states: ""Jokhon springbox Australia khelbe, sirijer shes matchti porer saptahe johannesburger ellis parke hobey."" which translates to ""When Springboks play Australia, their next match will be next week at Ellis Park in Johannesburg.""
"
Mission somoy nicher kontite space station a somosya hoyechhilo?,"The correct answer is **B: Ekti gyroscoper rakha (One gyroscope failed)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Spacewalk shesh howaa porjonto space station missione gyroscoper khoti howar poreo stationti taar dharan bojay rekheche."" This translates to: ""Even after a gyroscope failed during the space station mission, the station maintained its orientation until the spacewalk ended.""  This directly indicates the problem was a gyroscope failure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dhakka thekey sothik durotte bojay rakha (Maintaining correct distance from thrust)** - While Ciao and Sharipov were aware of this, it wasn't *the* problem. It was something they were monitoring *because* of the gyroscope failure.
*   **C: jet bimangulo sakriya kora (Activating jet thrusters)** - This was a *solution* to the problem, not the problem itself.
*   **D: Swabhabik dharan fire paoya (Returning to normal orientation)** - This was the *result* of the corrective actions, not the initial issue.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, space station tir missione er lokkhyo ki chhilo?","The correct answer is **A: Ekti hariye jaoya gyroscoper khunje ber kora (Finding a lost gyroscope)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the spacewalk happened *after* a gyroscope malfunctioned. The text focuses on the efforts to stabilize the station *because* of the gyroscope issue. While the other actions (adjusting alignment, spacewalk completion, activating jet controls) were *responses* to the problem, the underlying reason for the mission (and the spacewalk) was to address the failed gyroscope.



"
Maamlati somporke nicher kon bibriti ti sotyo noi?,"The correct answer is **A: Je rajye AOL er sadar daftar royechhe, sekhane er bichar kora hoyechhilo** (The trial was held in the state where AOL's headquarters is located).

Here's why:

* **The passage states the case involved AOL, but doesn't mention *where* the trial took place.** It only says Virginia was involved (""Maamlati Virginiai chalano hoyechilo""), but not that the trial was *in* Virginia. It could have been a different jurisdiction.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

* **B: Ekti drirha biswas orjon koraa hoyechhe** (A strong trust was earned) - The passage explicitly states this: ""...ei prothombarer moto drirha biswas orjon koraa hoyechhe.""
* **C: Maamlati te spam email sangkranto aainti byabohar kora hoyechhilo** (The case involved the use of anti-spam technology) - The passage clearly states the case was about preventing spam: ""...spam atkate 2003 ee karjokor howaa aainti byabohar korey...""
* **D: AOL ke abhijog kora hochchhilo** (AOL was accused) - The passage mentions AOL's building was accused of something: ""...AOL er bhaban jaa abhijog prorochito korechilo.""



"
Nicher kon bibriti ti Maamlati ke sothikbhabe bornona kore?,"The correct answer is **C: Maamlati 2003 saale chalano hoyechilo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""2003 ee karjokor howaa aainti byaboharkarider..."" which translates to ""This action was taken in 2003 to prevent users..."" This directly confirms the case happened in 2003.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: AOL er biruddhe aprayojaniya kichhu share koraa abhijog aana hoyechhilo** - While the case *involved* unwanted sharing, the passage states it was specifically about *bulk email* and *spam*. It doesn't say there was a general complaint about sharing anything unnecessary.
* **B: Maamlati te duiti prodhan shirshosthaniyo internet porisheba sarbarahokari sanstha jorito chhilo** - The passage only mentions AOL. It doesn’t mention a second prominent internet service provider being involved.
* **D: AOL mamlati-er abhijog prorochito korechilo** - The passage says AOL’s building was *subject* to the complaints, not that it *initiated* them.  It was accused of allowing the spam.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, Vidal  3 bochor aage kon clubtir hoye khela shuru korechhilen?","The correct answer is **A: Sevilla**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""28 bochor bayasi Vidal 3 bochor aage Sevilla thekey barcelonai jogdan korechilo."" This directly translates to ""28-year-old Vidal joined Barcelona 3 years ago from Sevilla.""  Therefore, before Barcelona, he played for Sevilla.
"
VidalBarcelonai -er hoye kotoguli match khelechhilen?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The text explicitly states: ""Katalan-rajdhanite aasaar por thekey Vidal clubtir hoye 49 ti game khelechilo."" This translates to ""After arriving in the Catalan capital, Vidal played 49 games for the club."" Since Barcelona is the Catalan capital, this means Vidal played 49 matches for Barcelona.
"
Match-e protipokkho kon dol chhilo?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonier**.

The text states ""robibar bolonier biruddhe nirdharito match khelar jonne seey hotelei chhilo"" which translates to ""He was at the hotel to play the match scheduled against Bolonier on Sunday."" This clearly indicates Bolonier was the opposing team.
"
Jerk keno hotel-e chhilo?,"The correct answer is **C: Robibar-e tar ekti match chhilo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""robibar bolonier bipokkhe porikolpito matcher aage Tini taar doler saathe hotele chhilen. Robibar bolonier biruddhe nirdharito match khelar jonne seey hotelei chhilo."" (He was at the hotel with his team before the match scheduled against Bolonia on Sunday. He was at the hotel to play the match against Bolonia on Sunday.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tar practice chhilo** - While he *coversianote prac-ritukalin proshikkhone* (practiced regularly), the reason for being at the hotel specifically is the match.
* **B: Tar prac-ritukalin meeting chhilo** - The passage doesn't mention any meeting.
* **D: Bolonier sathe tar proshikkhone chhilo** - He was with his *own* team, not training *with* Bolonia.



"
Jakarta Geophysics Agency keno satarkata jaari koreni?,"The correct answer is **D: Eti bhumikampati jonno matrar proyojan puran koreni**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...Jakarta Geophysics Agency anujai, kono sunami satarkata jaari koraa hobey naa kaaron bhumikampati 6.5 matrar proyojan puran koreni.""  This translates to ""…Jakarta Geophysics Agency stated that no tsunami warning will be issued because the 6.5 magnitude earthquake did not meet the required criteria.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sunami -r kono bhoy chhilo na** - While true *as a result* of the criteria not being met, this isn't the *reason* the agency didn't issue a warning. The criteria is the reason.
*   **B: Basinda der modhye atongkito chhorhiye pora eranor jonno** - The text says residents *were* panicked, but that wasn't the reason for the agency's decision.
*   **C: Sthaniyo byabosa upor kono probhab eranor jonno** - The text mentions business disruption as a consequence of panic, not as a reason for the agency's decision.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, ki karone bhumikampati hoyechhilo?","The correct answer is **D: skeler hisebe 6.5 matrar karone** (because of its magnitude of 6.5 on the Richter scale).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that a tsunami warning was *not* issued because the earthquake did *not* meet the requirements of a magnitude of 6.5 or greater.  The earthquake *itself*, and its magnitude, is the reason for the lack of warning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: atongkito basindara der karone** (because of panicked residents) - While residents *reacted* with panic, this didn't *cause* the earthquake.
*   **B: Sunamir jhunkir phalosrutite** (due to the possibility of a tsunami) - The passage states there was *no* tsunami warning.
*   **C: Jaari howa satarkata er karone** (because of the issued warning) - No warning was issued, so this is incorrect.



"
Eigulir modhye konti surjer ebong onyanyo sob nokkhotrogulir karjokarita chaalito kore?,"The correct answer is **C: Ghurnan ebong Ujjolota**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""systemer samasta nokkhotrogulir karjokarita taader ujjolota, taader ghurnan dwara porichalito hoy aar anno kichhu dwara noy."" (The activity of all the stars in the system is driven by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ujjolota ebong plasma probaher:** While plasma flow is mentioned in relation to the Rosby number, the passage states activity is *not* driven by anything else besides brightness and rotation.
*   **B: Rosby sankhya, ghurnan ebong chaumbakiya biporitmukhita:** Rosby number *relates* to activity levels, but doesn't *drive* the activity.  It's a consequence of the rotation and brightness.  Chaumbakiya biporitmukhita (magnetic reversals) is also related to activity, but not a primary driver.
*   **D: Ujjolota, Rosby sankhya ebong ghurnan:** Again, Rosby number is a consequence, not a driver.



"
Kibhabe ekti nokkhotrer Rosby sankhya nirdharon kora hoy?,"The correct answer is **A: Ujjolota ebong ghurnan (Brightness and rotation)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Tarar rosby number nirdharan korte, jaa plasma probaher saathe somporkito...Alokrashwi ebong ghurnan eksathe byabohrito hoy tarar rosby number nirdharan korte...""  This translates to ""The Rosby number of a star is determined, which is related to plasma flow...Brightness and rotation are used together to determine the star's Rosby number.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Plasma probaherporiman (Amount of plasma flow):** While related to the Rosby number, the passage says brightness and rotation are *used to determine* it, not that plasma flow *is* the Rosby number.
* **C: karjokarita er stor (Level of activity):** The Rosby number *indicates* the level of activity, but isn't determined *by* it.
* **D: chaumbakiya biporitmukhita er poriman (Amount of magnetic reversal):**  The passage states the Rosby number relates to magnetic reversal, but again, it's determined by brightness and rotation.



"
Somikkhay angsho niyechhe emon koto shatangsho lok Australier obilombe projatantra howar somorthon kore?,"The correct answer is **B: 29 shatangsho**.

The question asks for the percentage of commentators who believe Australia should become a republic ""as soon as possible."" The text states: ""Bhotgrahaner churanta porjaye somikkhitoder modhye 29 shatangsho biswas karen je joto taratari sombhob Austraileer projatantra howaa uchit..."" (After the vote count, 29 percent of commentators believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 31 shatangsho** - This is the percentage who believe Australia will *never* become a republic.
*   **C: 8 shatangsho** - This refers to the increase in opposition to an Australian republic between 2008 and 2010.
*   **D: 34 shatangsho** - This is the percentage who support keeping Queen Elizabeth II as Australia's head of state."
"Julia Gillard-er mote, Australier kakhon projatantra howa uchit?","The correct answer is **B: dwitiya runny Elijabethke er rajotwo shesh howar pore**.

The text states: ""prodhanmontri Julia Gillard daabi korechilen, tini biswas koren je runny dwitiya Elizabethr shasonkaler sheshe Australia projatantrik rajya hoye uthbe."" This directly translates to ""Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed she believes that Australia will become a democratic state after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.""
"
Kon sangostha aainee todonter adhiner aachhe?,"The correct answer is **C: Planned Parenthood**.

The passage states that the Comen Foundation has adopted a new rule denying funding to organizations under legal investigation, and specifically mentions that Planned Parenthood is being investigated due to concerns about how they spend their funding and a lack of transparency. Therefore, Planned Parenthood is the organization under legal investigation.
"
Cliff Stearns kon komitir prodhan?,"The correct answer is **A: House Energy and Commerce komitir**.

The text explicitly states: ""Tadaraki oo todonto upokomitir chermaner bhumikai Stearns House Energy and Commerce komitir adhine oo Planned Parenthooder madhyome taxguli gorvopater tohobiler jonno byabohar koraa hachche kina seey bishoye todonto korchen."" This translates to: ""Stearns is conducting an investigation under the House Energy and Commerce Committee to see if tax dollars are being used for abortions through Planned Parenthood.""

Therefore, Cliff Stearns is the head of the House Energy and Commerce Committee."
"Onuchchhed ti onujayee, suis mohilar sathe konti hoyni?","The correct answer is **B: Taake hotya kora hoy (She was murdered)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone, and arrested 5 people. It mentions the accused were presented in court. **There is no mention of the woman being murdered or subjected to any physical harm.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tar Churi jaoa jinishpotro uddhar kora hoy (Her stolen belongings were recovered):** This *is* stated in the passage.
*   **C: Shey 5 jon byakti kortrik jouno nirjatoner shikar hoy (She was a victim of abduction and torture by 5 people):** The passage only mentions abduction/arrest, not torture.
*   **D: Tar laptop ebong mobile phone churi hoye jaay (Her laptop and mobile phone were stolen):** This *is* stated in the passage.

Therefore, the only thing that *didn't* happen to the woman, according to the passage, is that she wasn't murdered."
2007 saale kon company ke taiwan sustainable ayaoyarde bhushito kora hoy?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The text explicitly states: ""ASUS, 2007 saale cheen projatontrer executive Yuan dwara taiwan sustainable ayaoyarde bhushito howar pore..."" (ASUS, in 2007, was honored with the Taiwan Sustainable Award by the Executive Yuan of China...).

Therefore, ASUS was the company honored.



"
ASUS II PC ki?,"The correct answer is **B: Laptop**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kichudin aage sulabh othocho karjokkhom pc hisabe ASUS II PC vishwajure lunch koraa hoyechilo..."" which translates to ""A few days ago, ASUS II PC was launched worldwide as an affordable functional PC..."" and later mentions ""...laptop computer bikroer bajare mulotoa baichitramay ebong poribortito hobey"" ( ...would fundamentally change and transform the laptop computer sales market).

This clearly indicates that ASUS II PC is a type of laptop. The other options (smartphone, tablet, pager) are not mentioned or implied in the text.



"
dakbibhager nothipatra hariye jaoyar jonno k daayi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ekti chele** (A boy).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ekti chele 429ti notun bochorer postcard soho dakbibhager 600 tiro beshi nothipatra lukiye rekhechilo jegulo taader prapokder kachhe pounchayni"" which translates to ""A boy had hidden 429 new year postcards along with over 600 of the post office's documents that didn't reach their recipients.""

This clearly indicates the boy is responsible for the missing postal items.



"
"Onuchchhed ti onujayee, ke hariye jaoya nothipatra er jonno khamaprarthana korechhen?","The correct answer is **D: Obanjaoa dakgharer**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""ei bishoyti abishkar korar por gotokali dakgharer pokkho thekey jonosadharon ebong ganomadhyomer kachhe khamaprarthana koraa hoyeche"" which translates to ""After the discovery of this matter, the post office side immediately apologized to the public and the masses.""

Therefore, it was the Obanjaoa post office that issued the apology for the lost letters.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sthaniya basinda ra (local residents):** They *received* the apology, they didn't *make* it.
*   **B: Chele ti (the boy):** He caused the problem, he didn't apologize for it.
*   **C: ganomadhyomer (the masses/public):** They *received* the apology, they didn't *make* it."
Kakhon Dell potro-r kandher somosyati saranor proyojon hoyechhilo?,"The correct answer is **C: Dwitiya set cholakalin** (During the second set).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dwitiya settir prothom dike dell potro pradhanno peyechilo, tobe 6-6 ee pouchonor pore etir khettreo tye breakerer proyojon hoy. Ei somoy potror kandhe chikitsa karate hoy..."" (In the first game of the second set, Dell Potro took the lead, but after reaching 6-6, a medical timeout was needed in his shoulder during the tie-break.)

Therefore, Dell Potro needed medical attention for his shoulder *during* the second set, specifically during the tie-break.
"
Prothom tye breakerer pholaphol ki chhilo?,"The correct answer is **A: Prothom tye breakerer pholaphol ki chhilo? Moore here giyechhilo.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Prothom sete dujon khelowar protiti surveyr porei Moore tye breake here jaay."" This translates to ""In the first set, after every service of both players, Moore lost the break."" This directly answers the question about the result of the break in the first set – Moore lost it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dell potro tar choter jonno here giyechhilo** - The passage doesn't mention Dell Potro losing a break in the first set.
*   **C: Moore Dwitiya sete joy laabh koren** - This talks about the second set, not the first.
*   **D: Dell potro Dwitiya sete joy labh koren** - This also talks about the second set, not the first.



"
"Onuchchhed onujaayee, sposhtobhabe, kara rogider sangosparshe esechilo?","The correct answer is **B: Sisura** (Children).

The text states: """"""""""""governor aro bolechilen, """"""""""""""""aaj amra jaante perechi, je kichhu skuleparar bayesi sisura rogider sangosparshe esechilo bole sonakto koraa hoyeche."""""""""""""""""""""""""""" 

This translates to: ""The governor also said, 'Today we have come to know that some schoolchildren have reportedly been in contact with patients.'""

Therefore, it was the *sisura* (children) who had contact with the patients.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, Texuser adhibasider kachhe governor kon ashwas ti denni?","The correct answer is **B: jonogoner nirapatta rakkhar jonno kaajguli somponno hoyechhe** (work is being done to protect the safety of the people).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ei adhikarikder sange tini Texuser adhibasider ashwas diyechilen je jonogoner nirapatta rakkhar jonno podokkhep neoa hoyeche."" This directly translates to ""He assured the residents of Texas that measures have been taken to protect the safety of the people.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: System ti valoi kaaj korche** (The system is working well) - While the governor *later* assured this, it wasn't the initial assurance given to residents.
*   **C: Tara cei maamlar chyalenj mokabilar jonno prostuto** (They are prepared to face those challenges) - This was a statement made by ""Perri"" not the governor directly to the residents as an assurance.
*   **D: Maamlati gurutoro noi** (The matter is not important) - The governor explicitly stated the matter *is* important (""Ei maamlati gurutoro"").



"
Duijon UW shikkharthi kon news pyarodi sors toiri korechhilen?,"The correct answer is **D: The Onion**.

The passage clearly states that Heck and Johnson, two UW students, conceived of a publication that would satirize news and reporting in 1988, which eventually became *The Onion*. The other options are mentioned in the passage as things that came *after* The Onion's creation or are related topics, but not the source itself.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, egulir modhye konti The Onion-er sangbad parody samrajyer antarbhukto noi?","The correct answer is **B: Ekti film**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions these as parts of The Onion's ""sattyikarer sangbad parody samrajye"" (satirical news parody empire):

*   **Ekti print sanskaran** (a print version)
*   **Ekti website** (a website - attracting 5,000,000 unique visitors)
*   **Bishwa manchitrabali** (Our Dumb World - a currently running global stage show)

It *doesn't* mention any films being produced by The Onion. While they might have been involved in film-related parodies, a full-fledged film production isn't listed as part of their empire in this passage."
"Onuchchhed onujayee, pulish ki pahara dichchhilo?","The correct answer is **C: Downing Streeter er probesh dwarer** (Downing Street's entrance).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""11:00 taar theek pore, bikkhovkarira White haller uttardikgami janchalachal abarodh korechilo."" (Immediately after 11:00, protesters blocked traffic heading north on Whitehall).  Whitehall leads *to* Downing Street. The police were positioned to try and control the protesters at Downing Street's entrance, as evidenced by ""11:20 ee pulish protibadkarider paaye hataar pothe fire jete bolechen"" (At 11:20, police asked protesters to move away from the path).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Trafalgar Squareer** - The protesters *passed by* Trafalgar Square, but the police weren't guarding it.
*   **B: Bosontokalin sammelan** - The police weren't guarding the conference itself, but rather the route the protesters were taking towards it.
*   **D: Grand Kanat room hotele** - Similar to B, the hotel was the *destination* of the protest, not where the police were initially stationed.



"
Pulish aaro jaanjot eranor jonno bikkhovkarider kakhon sore jete bolechhilen?,"The correct answer is **D: 11:20 er dike**.

The text states: ""11:20 ee pulish protibadkarider paaye hataar pothe fire jete bolechen."" This translates to ""At 11:20, the police asked the protesters to move to the side of the road."" 

Therefore, the police asked the protesters to move at 11:20."
Dr. Ehud R-er kora gobeshona somporke sotyiti ki?,"The correct answer is **B: Aage diabetes akranto howa idur der akhon ar diabetes nei** (Previously diabetes-affected people no longer have diabetes).

Here's why:

The text states: """"""""""""""Amader ekhon 4-maas-baysie Diabetes rog chara idur achhe jegulor aage Diabetes rog chhilo,"""""""" (We now have 4-month-old people without diabetes who previously had diabetes). This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pholapholguli aage thekei type 1 bahumutra rogi der jonno upokari hote pare** (Fruits might be beneficial for people with type 1 diabetes from before) - The text doesn't mention fruits or a benefit specifically for type 1 diabetes patients.
*   **C: Tini ashabadi je phalapholguli theke ekti protikar aashte paare** (He is hopeful that a cure might come from fruits) - Again, the text doesn't mention a cure or fruits being the source of a potential cure.
*   **D: Aage diabetes na howa kicchu idur er akhon diabetes hoyechhe** (Some people who didn't have diabetes before now have it) - The text specifically states the opposite – people *previously* with diabetes *no longer* have it.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, Dr. R ki bishoye sangshaye prokash koren?","The correct answer is **B: Kono niramoy sombhob kina (Whether a cure is possible)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bahumutra niramoyjogyo kina taa niye anyanno bisheshoggoder moto tinio sangshaye achhen.""  This translates to ""He also had doubts, like other specialists, about whether polyuria (excessive urination) is curable.""  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Phalapholguli type 1 bahumutra rog thaka rogider saathe sangslishto kina (Whether the findings are related to those with type 1 polyuria)** - The text *specifically* states the discovery has no connection to those with pre-existing type 1 polyuria. This isn't a doubt Dr. R has, but a statement he makes.
* **C: Niramoy somporke onyanyo bisheshogger motamot (Opinions of other specialists regarding the cure)** - While he shares the doubt *with* other specialists, the doubt itself is about the possibility of a cure.
* **D: Diabetes akranto na howa idur guli emoni thakbe kina (Whether the diabetes-free individuals will remain that way)** - The text doesn't express doubt about these individuals *remaining* diabetes-free, it focuses on whether the underlying condition causing the initial symptoms can be cured.



"
Nicher kon bibriti flight CC4684 crash er sothik bornona daay na?,"The correct answer is **C: Bimanti crash howar aage tin baar abataran korar cheshta kore (The flight attempted to land three times before crashing)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the flight *attempted* to land, but was canceled mid-air.** It doesn't mention any prior landing attempts. It says the disappearance happened ""dash minute aage"" (ten minutes before) the intended landing spot.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

* **A: Muloto aabhaoar karone bimanti abataran korte pareni (The flight was unable to land due to bad weather)** - The passage clearly states ""Kharap aabhaoar karone abataran batil hoyechilo"" (The landing was canceled due to bad weather).
* **B: Bimanti khub duroborti sthane crash kore (The flight crashed in a very inaccessible location)** - The passage says the crash site was ""durgam chhilo jee, 2 jhn pulishkormike jangale namiye deoa hoyechilo"" (so inaccessible that 2 police officers were lowered into the jungle).
* **D: Bimanti crash korar sthanti aabhaoar karone khotigrostho hoyechhilo (The flight was threatened by weather at the crash site)** -  This is implied by the fact bad weather *caused* the landing to be aborted and the crash site's conditions were challenging.



"
Ki karone Flight CG4684 er abataran batil kora hoyechhilo?,"The correct answer is **D: Aabhaoar poristhiti khub kharap chhilo** (The weather condition was very bad).

The text explicitly states: ""Kharap aabhaoar karone abataran batil hoyechilo, jaa anusandhano byahoto korey."" which translates to ""The landing was cancelled due to bad weather, which is being investigated.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: abataran korar sthanti durgom chhilo** (The landing site was difficult) - While the site *was* difficult to reach for rescuers, this wasn't the reason the landing was *cancelled*.
*   **B: CG4684 er aage akashe aro koyekti biman chhilo** (There were other planes in the sky ahead of CG4684) - This information is not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Bimanti Kokoday pherot pathano hoyechhilo** (The plane was returned to Kokoday) - The plane crashed, it wasn't simply returned.



"
"Onuchchhed ti onujayee, nicher kon bibriti ti Francijek Quall l -er obhiggota somporke sotyi?","The correct answer is **A: Tini ekti janala bhenge felte sokkhom hoyechhilen** (She was able to break a window).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Abosheshe 1ti kaanch venge gele taara janla diye bere berote thaake."" This translates to ""Finally, breaking 1 glass, she was able to get out through the window."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Shesh porjonto tar kono khoti hoyni** (She wasn't injured until the end) - The text doesn't mention if she was injured or not.
*   **C: Beriye asar cheshta korar samay tini ekti chair bhenge felechhilen** (While trying to get out, she broke a chair) - The text doesn't mention a chair.
*   **D: Ekti janala bhangar somoy tini ahoto hoyechhilen** (She was hurt when a window broke) - The text doesn't say she was hurt, only that she *broke* a window to escape.



"
Krantiya jhor Daniel-er sambhabbo prabhab mullayan koraa keno kathin?,"The correct answer is **C: Jhorti Sthalorekha thekey onek dure** (The storm is far from the coastline).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sthalorekha thekey onek dure thakay, Markin juktorashtro baa Caribbeander upor jhorer sambhabbo prabhab mullayan koraa kathin hoye jay."" This directly translates to ""Because the storm is far from the coastline, it is difficult to assess the potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jhor ti shaktishali hoye ekti harricanea porinoto hobey bole onuman kora hoyechhe** (It is estimated that the storm will become a powerful hurricane) - While true, this doesn't explain *why* it's hard to assess the impact.
*   **B: Bigyanira jhor tir prabhab somporke nishchito non** (Scientists are not sure about the storm's impact) - The passage doesn't say scientists are unsure, only that assessment is difficult.
*   **D: Jhorti Mayami theke onek dure aboshthito** (The storm is far from Miami) - The distance from Miami is a detail, but the key factor making impact assessment difficult is the distance from *any* coastline.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, Krantiya jhor Daniel er somporke kon bibriti ti sotyi noy?","The correct answer is **D: Eti Sthalorekha er kachhei chhilo (It was near the coastline)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mayami, Florida thekey 3000 mile dure abosthanroto"" (Located 3000 miles from Miami, Florida).  This clearly indicates the storm was *far* from the coastline, not near it.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

* **A: Caribbeander upor jhorer prabhab ojana (Knowing the impact of the storm on the Caribbean):** The passage states it's *difficult* to assess the potential impact on the US or the Caribbean due to its distance from land. This confirms it's an uncertainty, not a false statement.
* **B: Eti Atlantik mahasagare srishti hoyechhilo (It was created in the Atlantic Ocean):** The passage states ""purbo Atlantik mahasagare"" (in the eastern Atlantic Ocean).
* **C: Eti ekti harricanea porinoto hote pare (It could turn into a hurricane):** The passage says ""Daniel shaktishali harricanea porinoto hobey"" (Daniel will turn into a powerful hurricane).



"
"Onuchchhed ti onujayee, kono Bishwajure mahamari srishti korar aage er sathe oboshyoi ki ghotte hobe?","The correct answer is **A: Etike kom pranghati hoye porbe** (It will necessarily become less virulent).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Dr. Lee reports research showing the virus is becoming less virulent ( কম প্রংঘাতিক ) before a pandemic occurs. This is a key point he makes about how pandemics often begin.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Uposorgo gulike oboshyoi mridu thakbe** (The symptoms must be mild) - While mild symptoms are *a result* of lower virulence, the passage focuses on the *change in the virus itself* (virulence) not just the symptoms.
*   **C: Onek beshi manushke akranto hobe** (Many more people will be infected) - Increased infection is a possibility with milder symptoms, but isn't the necessary precursor to a pandemic according to the passage.
*   **D: sisu der modhye oboshyoi er uposorgo dekha dibe** (Symptoms must be seen among children) - The passage specifically mentions children being infected, but doesn't say symptoms *must* appear in them before a pandemic. It's simply an observation of current infection.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, typhunti ti Fujian theke koto dure chhilo?","The correct answer is **D: 77 kilometre**.

Here's why:

The passage states the typhoon was ""pray sottor kilometre dure"" (approximately seventy kilometres) from Fujian province.  ""Sottor"" means seventy in Bengali. While there's a slight ambiguity due to the phrasing ""pray sottor,"" the closest and most logical answer from the choices is 77 kilometres.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 9 kilometre** - This number doesn't appear in the text.
*   **B: 11 kilometre** -  The text mentions 11 kilometres per hour as the speed, not the distance.
*   **C: 70 kilometre** - While close, ""pray sottor"" implies a value *around* seventy, and 77 is the closest option.



"
George W. Bush er Asia te agomoner pore taake k swagoto janan?,"The correct answer is **D: Upo-Prodhanmontri**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Singapur upo-prodhanmontri Wang Quan Sheng taake swagoto janiyechilen..."" which translates to ""Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Wang Quan Sheng welcomed him..."" 

Therefore, the Deputy Prime Minister welcomed George W. Bush upon his arrival in Asia."
President kakhon eshiate banijya somprosaroner kotha bolechhilen?,"The correct answer is **C: Mid term nirbachone tar haarer pore**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mid term nirbachone haarer ek saptaha pore Bush eshiate banijya somprosaroner kotha bollen."" This directly translates to ""One week after losing the midterm elections, Bush talked about expanding trade in Asia.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tini Singapur-er pouchhanor pore** - While he *did* discuss trade after arriving in Singapore, the passage specifically links the trade discussion to the election results.
*   **B: Wang Quan Sheng er sathe** - He discussed trade *with* Wang Quan Sheng, but that isn't when he *brought up* the topic of expanding trade.
*   **D: saptahabyapi eshia soforer pore** - The trip to Asia happened *before* he spoke about expanding trade, the timing is the key - it was *after* the election.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, nicher konti sarkarer sarbik lokkhyo?","The correct answer is **D: boggy te manusher atirikto bhir laghob kora** (To reduce the excessive crowding of people in buses).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Aajker ghoshonai atirikto bahoner jonno tohobiler ei bochorer Marche koraa sarkarer protiggakeo bordhito koreche."" This translates to ""Today's announcement has reinforced the government's commitment to prevent excessive crowding this year during the March.""
* **The passage also mentions:** adding 300 buses to reach a total of 1,300 buses. This is *in order to* control overcrowding.

Therefore, the overall goal of the government, as evidenced by the passage, is to alleviate excessive crowding on the buses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While more buses are planned, the passage doesn't state *that* is the overall goal, just a *means* to an end.
* **B & C:** These refer to specific numbers of buses acquired, not the overarching goal.
* **D:** This directly addresses the problem the government is trying to solve - overcrowding."
Sarkar ki ghoshonai korechhilo?,"The correct answer is **B: Tara boggy er somosya dur korte protigga-boddho** (They are committed to solving the boggy problem).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Aajker ghoshonai atirikto bahoner jonno tohobiler ei bochorer Marche koraa sarkarer protiggakeo bordhito koreche."" This translates to ""Today's announcement has also strengthened the government's commitment to building facilities for extra crowds in this year's March.""
* **This directly indicates** the government made a commitment (protigga) to address the problem of overcrowding (boggy er somosya).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't say they're *planning* to acquire 300 more bogies, it says they *already* acquired 300 *in addition* to the existing 1,000.
* **C:**  The passage states a *total* of 1,300 bogies have been acquired, not that they are planning to acquire that many.
* **D:** While the intention is to solve the overcrowding, the passage doesn’t guarantee the problem *will* be solved. It just highlights the government’s commitment to addressing it.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, kon tathya ti jana achhe?","The correct answer is **C: Ekti akromoner ashonka achhe (There is a suspicion of an attack)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Emon kono buddhi nei jeta ekta asonno porikolpito akromoner kotha agam janate paare."" This translates to ""There is no intelligence that can tell whether there is an unplanned, fabricated story of an attack."" This directly indicates a *suspicion* or possibility of an attack being fabricated, meaning there's an underlying concern about an attack potentially happening.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Humkir matra komechhe (The threat has decreased):** The passage actually says the *reduction* in threat doesn't mean the threat is gone overall. It's a nuanced statement, not a confirmation of a decreased threat.
* **B: Aar kono humki nei (There are no threats):**  The passage clearly discusses the possibility of an attack, even if fabricated, so this is incorrect.
* **D: Intelligence nishchito korechhe je akromon ti bhoyaboho hobe (Intelligence has confirmed the attack will be terrifying):** The passage explicitly states intelligence *cannot* determine if an attack is happening or will be terrifying.



"
 bikkhove somporke kon bibrititi sotyi noy?,"The correct answer is **A: rashtrapati commission chhilo  bikkhove er byapare ekti protikriya** (The presidential commission was a reaction in the matter of the protests).

Here's why:

*   The passage states the commission was formed *to lead the country towards new elections* as part of a package to supersede the previous CEP, which was a response to the protests. The commission wasn't a reaction *to* the protests, but rather a step taken *because of* them to address the underlying issues (delayed elections and political instability).

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

*   **B: Bilombito nirbachon bikkhove er sutropat kore** (Delayed elections sparked the protests) - The passage explicitly links the protests to the failures in organizing elections since 2011.
*   **C: bikkhove ti purboborti CEP'r podotyager superish kore** (The protests led to the superseding of the previous CEP) - The passage states the commission superseded the previous CEP in response to the protests.
*   **D: bikkhove majhe majhe hingsro hoye uthchhilo** (The protests were sometimes violent) - The passage describes the protests as ""teebro"" (intense) and implies escalation, suggesting violence.



"
Sorboshesh CEP-er podotyager jonno ke superish diyechhilen?,"The correct answer is **C: Rashtrapati commission**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Goto masse ekti rashtrapati commission deshtike notun nirbachoner dike niye jawar jonno podokkheper ekti pyakejer ongsho hisebe purboborti CEP'r podotyager superish korey."" This directly translates to ""A presidential commission superseded the previous CEP as part of a step to lead the country towards new elections.""

Therefore, the presidential commission is the one that superseded the previous CEP."
"Bibriti ti onujayee, Nasser ayathlitder sathe durbyabohar korar por thekey USA Gymnastics konti somorthon kore na?","The correct answer is **A: Shonod-potro kerhe newa (Taking testimony/hearing)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that USA Gymnastics supports the US Olympic Committee's acknowledgement of the need to improve safety and supports changes within the organization. It also mentions how Larry Nasser was able to abuse athletes for a long time because his misconduct wasn't openly reported. This implies a failure to *take testimony* or *hear* the complaints of athletes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ekti khomotayito poribesh toiri kora (Creating a empowering environment)** - The passage explicitly states they aim to create a safe and empowering environment.
*   **C: Sangsthar modhye proyojoniyo poriborton (Necessary changes within the organization)** - They support necessary changes.
*   **D: Ekti swadhin todonto (An independent investigation)** - The passage mentions supporting an independent investigation (todonto) that can investigate different organizations involved.



"
"Bibriti ti onujayee, egiye jaoyar jonno USA Gymnastics ebong United States Olympic komiti er mul lokkhyo ti ki?","The correct answer is **D: ayathlitder jonno ekti nirapod poribesher bikash kora** (Developing a safe environment for athletes).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""USA Gymnastics and USOC’s Eki lakshya- Gymnastics, ebong anyanno khelagulike, kriabidder jonno jotota sombhob nirapad koraa jaate taaraa ekti nirapad, nishchito ebong khomotashil poribeshe taader swapno anusaran korte paare."" This directly translates to ""USA Gymnastics and the USOC’s shared goal is to make gymnastics, and other sports, as safe as possible for athletes so they can pursue their dreams in a safe, secure, and empowering environment.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Larry Nasser-er opobayboharke alokpat kora** (Exposing Larry Nasser's abuse) - While acknowledging the past abuse is important, it's presented as a catalyst for change, not the ultimate goal.
*   **B: Shangshapotro kere neyoar dharonak egiye niye jawa** (Continuing the reform process) - This is a *method* to achieve the goal, not the goal itself.
*   **C: Ekti gopon todonto chaliye jaoya** (Running a secret investigation) - The text explicitly mentions transparency and speaking out against abuse, the opposite of secrecy.



"
Ghotonati ghotar somoy jahajti kothay jacchhilo? ,"The correct answer is **C: palawaner**.

The text states the ship was heading towards ""palawaner puerto princessor dike"" (Puerto Princesa in Palawan). Therefore, at the time of the event, the ship was going to Palawan.



"
Onuchchhede ullikhito jahaj sangkranto kon ghotonati sotyi noy?,"The correct answer is **B: Eti palawaner chhilo (It was from Palawan)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the ship was *going towards* Puerto Princesa, Palawan. It doesn't say the ship *was from* Palawan. The other options are directly stated in the text:

*   **A: Eti puerto princessor dike jachchilo (It was going towards Puerto Princesa):**  This is stated directly.
*   **C: Eti ekti mine protibyabosthar jahaj (It is a mine-countermeasure ship):** The passage says it was involved in an incident related to mines.
*   **D: Etike Markin naubahini soptom noubohore nijukto kora hoyechhe (It has been assigned to the 7th Fleet of the US Navy):** This is also stated directly.

Therefore, only option B is not a true statement based on the provided text."
Markin senabahini niye k bibriti diyechhen?,"The correct answer is **C: ices joddhader**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""**Bibrititi janiyeche dhrito ices joddhader prohora deoar dayitto nicheche Turosko.**"" This translates to ""It has been reported that Turkey has taken responsibility for guarding the detained ISIS fighters."" 

The question asks about what *bibriti* (report/statement) says about the US military. The report specifically concerns the responsibility for ISIS fighters, not a statement *by* the US military or any individuals mentioned in the other options.



"
"Bibriti ti onujayee, dhrito joddhader prohora deoar dayitto kon desh grohon korechhe?","The correct answer is **D: Turosko (Turkey)**.

The passage states: ""Bibrititi janiyeche dhrito ices joddhader prohora deoar dayitto nicheche Turosko."" This translates to ""It has been reported that Turkey has taken responsibility for guarding the detained fighters.""
"
Durghatanati karon ti ki bole mone kora hoy?,"The correct answer is **B: shotruder gulir** (enemy fire).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...biswas koraa hoy shotruder gulir falaswarup eti ghote"" which translates to ""...it is believed that this happened as a result of enemy fire."" 

While the passage mentions difficult terrain and bad weather as challenges *during* the investigation, it explicitly identifies enemy fire as the *believed cause* of the crash.



"
Kon dhoroner bhukhander Durghatanati ghote?,"The correct answer is **B: Kothin** (Difficult).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Durghatanasthal onusondhaner chestar somoy **kharap abhawa ebong kharap bhukhander sammukhin hote hoy**."" This translates to ""During the investigation of the accident site, they faced bad weather and **difficult terrain**."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Protikul (Adverse/Hostile):** While the situation was dangerous, the passage specifically describes the *terrain* as challenging, not the overall circumstances being hostile.
*   **C: Joutho (Joint):** This refers to the joint military force, not the terrain.
*   **D: Pahari (Hilly/Mountainous):** While the passage mentions ""unchu pahari anchale"" (high mountainous area), it doesn't describe the *terrain* itself as ""pahari."" It says the terrain was *kharap* (bad/difficult).



"
bonnar pholaphol hisabe kormokortara ki aasha korchen?,"The correct answer is **A: balutotoguli punoruddhar korar** (restoring the sandbars).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""kormokortara aasha korchen eti bhatir dike khoyprapto balutotoguli punoruddhar korar jonno jotheshto hobe"" - which directly translates to ""workers are hoping that this will be sufficient to restore the sandbars lost towards the tide.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Upokul saikater srishti** (creation of coastal beaches) - While sandbars contribute to beaches, the primary hope is for the sandbars themselves to return.
* **C: Humpback Chaabo er sangkhya briddhi** (increase in the number of Humpback Chub) - The passage mentions the Humpback Chub is endangered *because* of the dam and resulting changes, not that restoring sandbars will directly increase their population.
* **D: Aro bonnojiboner basosthan** (more habitats) -  Restoring the sandbars will *lead* to more habitats, but the immediate hope is for the sandbars themselves.



"
bandhti nirmito howar jonno nicher konti ke sthayi bhabe probhabito korechhilo?,"The correct answer is **A: Baluchar**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Baluchar ebong samudrasaikat toiri korar jonno ei adhahkkheper proyojan chhilo..."" (This area was needed to create Baluchar and sea beaches...).  This directly links the dam construction to the creation/modification of Baluchar.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Humpback Chaabo:** While the passage mentions the Humpback Chaabo being endangered *as a result* of the changes, the dam itself didn't directly cause it to exist.
* **C: bonnojiboner basosthan:**  This is a consequence of the changes (the dam impacting habitat), not something directly affected by the dam's construction *for* the purpose of creating it.
* **D: Poly chhoriye pora:** This (sedimentation) is a *result* of the dam, not something the dam was built *for*.



"
"Onuchchhed ti onujayee, sombhabyo hamla bishoye k America juktorashtro k intel diyechhilo?","The correct answer is **C: Ekti aghoshito utso**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""America juktorashtro janiyeche je taaraa **ekti aghoshito utso thekey tothyo peyeche** jekhane Ethiopia ebong Kenyar """"""""bishishto sthanguli"""""""" uriye deoar jonno attoghati bomaru bimaner byaboharer ullekh koraa hoyeche."" 

This directly translates to ""America has learned that they received information from **an undisclosed source** about the use of suicide bombers to target specific locations in Ethiopia and Kenya.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Somaliar ugroponthiraa (Somali militants):** The passage says the militants *are planning* the attack, not that they *provided* the intelligence.
*   **B: Ethiopia dutabas (Ethiopian embassy):** The embassy is a potential target, not the source of information.
*   **D: Kenyar ekti utso (A Kenyan source):** While Kenya is involved, the passage specifically mentions the source is ""aghoshito"" (undisclosed) and doesn't identify it as being from Kenya.



"
Nicher kon bibrititi ugroponthira tothakothito akromon parikalpana ke sothikvabe bornona kore?,"The correct answer is **C: Duti desher sthanguli te boma bisphoron kore** (Bombing specific locations in two countries).

Here's why:

The text (P) explicitly states the Somali militant group is planning attacks on **both Kenya and Ethiopia**, targeting ""**bishishto sthanguli**"" (specific locations) in both countries.  This directly translates to bombing specific locations in two countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ekti desher sthanguli te boma bisphoron kore** (Bombing specific locations in one country) - The text mentions *two* countries.
*   **B: Duti deshe boma bisphoron** (Bombing in two countries) - While true, it doesn't specify *specific locations* which is mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Ekti deshe boma bisphoron** (Bombing in one country) - Again, the text mentions two countries.



"
Nicher kon byakti aainjibi non?,"The correct answer is **A: Petros Mantouvaloske**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...sangsader sadasya oo **aainjibi** Petros Mantouvaloske podotyag korte hoyechilo..."" ( ""...member of parliament and **lawyer** Petros Mantouvalos had to resign..."")

While Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nicolacopollos *are* lawyers (stated as ""Greek aainjibi"" - Greek lawyers), the question asks *which* person from the provided options is a lawyer. Petros Mantouvalos is explicitly identified as one in the text. Makis Triantafyllopouloser is identified as a journalist (""sangbadik"").



"
Kon goshthike Greek aainee sampradayer modhye kelenkari er angsho hisebe ullekh kora hoyni?,"The correct answer is **C: Sangbadik**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions that lawyers (aainjibi, solicitor, attorney), judges (bicharok), and even the Chief Justice (pradhan bicharpati) were involved in the scandal of bribery and corruption. It states these professions being involved was a ""huge scandal"" within the Greek legal tradition.

However, the journalist (sangbadik) Makis Triantafyllopoulos *reported* on the scandal, leading to a member of parliament and a lawyer being accused. The journalist was not *part* of the scandal that created the disruption *within* the legal system itself. They were an outside force revealing it.



"
Bharat kotoguli wicket hariyechhe?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The passage clearly states: ""adhinayaker wicket haranor por Bharat matro 36 raan korte 7 wicket hariye felle innings shes hoye jaay."" which translates to ""After losing the captain's wicket, India lost 7 wickets for just 36 runs and the innings ended.""
"
"Onuchchhed ti onujayee, innings er sorbochcho score ti koto chhilo?","The correct answer is **A: 70 raan**.

The passage explicitly states that Robin Uthappa scored 70 runs. While the passage mentions other scores and events, 70 is the highest individual score mentioned."
Nicher konti Adam Quarden-er hatasha er karon noy?,"The correct answer is **C: Wells er na shona**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""তিনি [Wells] muloto amader shuru thekei mithya bolechen... Dwitioto, amader shonar vaan koreয়।"" (He [Wells] has been lying to us from the beginning... Secondly, he made us hear things.) This indicates Quarden is frustrated that Wells *made them hear things*, not that he himself didn't hear Wells.

Let's look at why the other options *are* reasons for Quarden's frustration:

* **A: saiter  jouno content sangkranto notun nitimalar (new policies regarding publicly-licensed content)** - The passage mentions a draft policy regarding openly-licensed media hosted for millions of site users, indicating this is a source of concern/frustration.
* **B: Wells er shilpo muche fela (Wells' artwork being deleted)** - The passage directly states Wells’ artwork was deleted and that he initially pretended it was due to a certain reason, causing frustration.
* **D: shilpo muche fela er mithya karon bola (lying about the reason for the artwork being deleted)** - This is explicitly mentioned in the passage: ""Tini [Wells] muloto amader shuru thekei mithya bolechen."" (He [Wells] has been lying to us from the beginning.)



"
"Onuchchhed ti onujayee, site theke konti muche fela hoyechhe?","The correct answer is **A: Shilpo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""taar **shilpo muche fela porjonto** tini prothome, abhinoy korey je eti aaini karone."" This directly translates to ""until her **artwork was deleted** she first acted as if it was a mistake.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jouno content** - The text mentions openly-licensed ""jouno content"" being *hosted*, not deleted.
*   **C: Ekti nitimalar khasra** - A draft policy is currently being worked on, not deleted.
*   **D: Byaktigoto malikanadhin media** - The text does not state that privately-owned media was deleted.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, nicher konti Amir Khaan samarthan koren na?","The correct answer is **A: Olympike mohilader joddhader antarbhukto kora** (Including women's boxing in the Olympics).

Here's why:

The passage states Amir Khan said, ""aami monekori mohilader laraai koraa uchit noy"" (I think women shouldn't fight). This directly indicates he does *not* support women's boxing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: British protijogider** - He explicitly states he will support British competitors in the 2012 London Olympics.
*   **C: Mohilader motamot** - While he has an opinion on women fighting, the text doesn't suggest he doesn't respect women in general (""mohilaader motamot"").
*   **D: Londone er Olimpiker ayojon kora** - The text doesn't say anything about his support for or against the London Olympics being held.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, byaktigoto motamot thaka sottweo Amir Khan nicher kontike samarthan korben?","The correct answer is **C: 2012 Olympike**.

Here's why:

The passage states that despite his personal opinion (""I think women shouldn't fight""), Amir Khan said he would support British competitors at the 2012 London Olympics. This directly indicates his support for the 2012 Olympics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mohilader joddhader (Women's fighting):** He explicitly stated he *doesn't* think women should fight.
*   **B: 2004 Olympike tar soho protijogider (His fellow competitors at the 2004 Olympics):** The passage doesn't mention support for competitors from 2004.
*   **D: Onyanyo roupyo podok bijeta der (Other silver medal winners):** The passage focuses on Amir Khan's support for the 2012 Olympics, not other medalists.



"
Pitter Lenj kakhon mara jaan?,"The correct answer is **C: Haspatale** (In the hospital).

Here's why:

The text states that Pitter Lenj ""pore maaraa jaachhen"" (died later) at the local hospital after being taken there by the medical team. While the accident happened during the warm-up and involved falling off his bike and being hit, he *died* in the hospital.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Warm up packer somoy** (During warm-up practice) - This is when the accident happened, not when he died.
*   **B: Taar bike thekey pore giye** (After falling off his bike) - This is how he was injured, not when he died.
*   **D: on tracker medicaler karmira sathe thakakalin** (While with the on-track medical team) - He was transported *by* them, but didn't die with them.



"
Javier Jayet k?,"The correct answer is **B: Arekjon racer**.

Here's why:

The text states ""sahokari racer Javier Jayet dwara aghat paay"" which means Javier Jayet was a fellow racer who caused the accident. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.

*   **A: Ekjon on tracker medicaler karmira** - While medical personnel were involved *after* the accident, Jayet himself wasn't one of them.
*   **C: Ekjon daktar** - The text doesn't mention Jayet being a doctor.
*   **D: Ekjon bhakto** - This doesn't fit the context of a racing accident.



"
Kon poristhitite ekjon udwigno flyer bimaner obhyontorin kaajguli bojha theke upokrito hote paren?,"The correct answer is **B: Jodi tader onichchhak ajana voy ghire thaake** (If they are anxious about unknown flights).

Here's why:

The passage states that understanding how a plane works and what happens during flight can help alleviate anxiety caused by a *lack of control*. This directly addresses the fear of the unknown that often plagues nervous flyers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jatrira jodi tader voy niye lajjito hoy** (If passengers are embarrassed about their fear) - The passage specifically states that there's no shame in being afraid and keeping personal fears private.  Embarrassment isn't the core issue being addressed.
*   **C: Jodi tader onichchhak poribohoner proti birup hoye thaken** (If passengers are averse to all forms of transport) - This is too broad. The passage focuses specifically on flight anxiety.
*   **D: Jodi tader udweg bimane urar saathe somporko nei emon kono aghatmulok ghotona theke udvuto hoy** (If their anxiety stems from a traumatic incident related to flying) - While past trauma can contribute to flight anxiety, the passage focuses on the more general fear arising from a lack of understanding and control, not necessarily a specific past event.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, nicher konti ekjon mulyo-socheton bhromon karir sobsheshe kora uchit?","The correct answer is **A: Ekadhik bhromon companyr offer anusandhan kora (Researching offers from multiple travel companies)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that people *rarely* book directly through airlines anymore, and often find different prices for the same flight. It emphasizes the importance of **researching** and **comparing** prices.  While checking the airline website (D) is mentioned, it's done *as part of* the research process, not as the sole method.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Sarasari airliner madhyome book koraa (Booking directly through airlines):** The passage specifically states this is less common now.
* **C: bivinno bhromon companyr mulyer modhye tulona kora (Comparing prices between different travel companies):** This is *part* of the research, but 'A' is broader and encompasses all avenues of finding the best deal.
* **D: Airline er website check kora (Checking the airline's website):** This is a step in the process, but not the whole solution.



"
"Onuchchhed ti onujayee, sorbottom sombhabyo flight er mulyo surakkhito korar jonno jatrider prothome ki kora uchit?","The correct answer is **A: Airline er website check kora** (Checking the airline's website).

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states: ""...ticket sanrakkhaner aage nijei biman sangosthatir website dekhe ortho din."" (Before securing a ticket, it is often worthwhile to check the airline's website itself first.)

This directly suggests that checking the airline's website is the first thing a passenger should do to potentially secure the best price.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Bivinno aggregatorer mulyer modhye tulona kora** (Comparing prices among different aggregators) - While comparison is mentioned, it's stated *after* checking the airline's website.
*   **C: Sarasari airliner madhyome book koraa** (Booking directly through an average airliner) - The passage suggests avoiding booking through average airliners.
*   **D: Ekjon bhromon agent er madhome sarasari book koraa** (Booking through a travel agent) - Similar to C, the passage leans towards direct booking.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, sofolvabe Acordione bajanor jonno konti nirvul tip hishebe bibechona kora hobe na?","The correct answer is **A: Otirikto awaj pawar jonno, chabigulike chapte je shokti proyog koren ta brriddhi korun** (Increase the force you apply to the keys to get extra sound).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mone rakhben je pianor moto otirikto awaj pawar jonno chabigulike otyadhik jore aghat korar dorkar nei."" (Keep in mind that, like a piano, you don't need to hit the keys too hard to get extra sound).

This directly contradicts option A, making it the tip *not* to follow for successful accordion playing. The passage advocates for a gentler touch, not increased force.

Let's look at why the other options are correct tips according to the passage:

*   **B: Apnar shokti dhore rakhar jonno oproyojone nora-chora jotota somvob niyontron korun** (Control unnecessary movement as much as possible to conserve energy) - The passage mentions keeping your hands relaxed and not straining your fingers.
*   **C: Halka haate note-guli chapar somoy sotorko thakun** (Be careful to press the notes with a light hand) - The passage emphasizes a relaxed hand and avoiding excessive force.
*   **D: Gotibeger baran, er maddhome apni otirikto awaj pawar jonno, chabigulike chapben** (Use the bellows, through which you will press the keys to get extra sound) - The passage mentions pressing with the bellows for louder sounds.



"
"Acordione bajanor somoy, nicher konti awaj barate sahajyo kore?","The correct answer is **A: Aro gotibeger** (More pressure/force).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Acordione, uchchoswore shobdo shunte niche jore baa gotibeger saathe chap din.""  This translates to: ""For the accordion, to hear louder sounds, press with more force or pressure.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: otyadhik jore (excessive force)** - The passage specifically says you *don't* need excessive force like a piano.
*   **C: Kom chap (less pressure)** -  The passage indicates *more* pressure is needed.
*   **D: Kom angulguli er nora-chora (less finger movement)** - The passage focuses on *how* you press, not reducing movement.



"
televisiongulo Chitroti simanagulio kata thake keno?,"The correct answer is **B: Chitroti jaate somogro screentike abrito korte paare** (So that the picture can cover the entire screen).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Chitroti jaate somogro screentike abrito korte paare ta nischit korar jonno eti toiri kora hoyeche."" (It is made to ensure the picture can cover the entire screen).  This is the direct reason given for televisions cutting off the edges of the picture (overscan).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Subtitle er jayga rakhar jonno** (To leave space for subtitles) - While overscan *can* cut off subtitles, this isn't the *reason* for overscan. The passage mentions subtitle issues as a *consequence* of overscan, not the cause.
*   **C: Onyanyo formate sahoje convart korar sujog dewar jonno** (To easily convert to other formats) - This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Subtitle ke khub nicher dike kaatar jonno** (To cut subtitles to the very bottom) - This is also incorrect, as the passage explains subtitles can be *completely* cut off, not just moved lower.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Kono ekta cinema DVD-te convart korar somoy keo kon dhoroner somosyati sommukheen hobe?","The correct answer is **B: Subtitle er kichu ongsho prodorshito hobe na** (Some parts of the subtitle will not be displayed).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""video er nicher ongshe jodi subtitle thaake tahole seguli sompurnorupe prodorshito hobe na"" which translates to ""if there are subtitles at the bottom of the video, they will not be fully displayed.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ekti chitroti jaate somogro screentike abrito kore na** (A picture doesn't cover the whole screen) - While overscan *leads* to this, it's not the problem itself, it's a consequence.
*   **C: Ekti chitroti jaate somogro screentike abrito** (A picture covers the whole screen) - This is the opposite of the issue.
*   **D: simanagulio kete jabe** (The borders will be cut off) - This is also a consequence of overscan, but the *problem* that the user will face is the missing subtitles.



"
British senabahinir kothay obosthito chhilo?,"The correct answer is **C: Boardentown**.

The text states that General John Cadwalder would launch attacks against the British forces at Boardentown to become stronger. While the other locations are mentioned as part of the overall plan, Boardentown is specifically where the British army was initially located in relation to Cadwalder's actions."
Hostolikhito khosra te kar swakkhorito chhilo?,"The correct answer is **D: Charles Thomson**.

The passage states: ""ainsobhar sobhapoti John Hancock ebong sochib **Charles Thomson** dwara swakkhorito ekti hostolikhito khosra..."" which translates to ""the president of the Congress John Hancock and secretary **Charles Thomson** signed a handwritten draft...""

Therefore, Charles Thomson was one of the people who signed the handwritten draft.
"
"Nicher sthangulir baaire, Dunlap Broadsides sobsheshe kothay pauchhechhilo?","The correct answer is **C: London**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ekta copy London pouchay 10 i august."" (A copy reached London on August 10th). This directly answers where a Dunlap Broadside was found outside of the mentioned locations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: New York:** While a copy was *read* in New York, it doesn't say copies were *found* there generally.
*   **B: Dunlop-er chhapakhanay:** This is where the copies were *made*, not where they ultimately ended up being found.
*   **D: independence holo-er:** ""Independence holo-er"" (Independence Hall) is a place of origin/proclamation, not a location where copies were found later.



"
Cornell  Stark er senabahinir kothay abosthan korchhilo?,"The correct answer is **A: Uttor diker byara dhore** (Along the northern edge of the border).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Colonist-er abosthaner uttor diker byara dhore Stark-er lokera abosthan korechilo."" This directly translates to ""Stark's men were positioned along the northern edge of the colonist's border.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Soikoter joler kinare** (Beside a small stretch of water) - While they *eventually* built a small fortification there, it wasn't their initial position.
*   **C: Upodwiper uttor-purbe** (Northeast of the peninsula) - This describes the general area of the Mystic River, but not *where* Stark's men were positioned.
*   **D: Byara er samne** (In front of the border) - The text says they were *along* the border, not directly in front of it. Gridley/Stark put a rope across the border, implying their position was on the border itself.



"
"Onucchhed onujayi, Stark er lokera tader byara kokhon briddhi korechhilo?","The correct answer is **C: Nimno joar cholakale**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nimno joar jokhon upodwiper uttor-purbe Mystic nodi borabor ekti mukh khullo, tara druto ekti chhoto pathorer prachir tene uttor diker chhoto ekti soikoter joler kinare bosiye dilo."" This translates to: ""When the low tide opened a mouth in the northeast of the peninsula on the Mystic River, they quickly built a small stone barricade and settled on the shore on the north side.""  This directly indicates they strengthened their position (increased their ""byara"") *during* low tide.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jokhon ouponibeshikra aro shaktibriddhi korar ahoban janay:** This refers to the general call for increased power, not a specific time they strengthened their position.
*   **B: Niyamokra dori par howar por:** The rope was a *restriction* on firing, not a cause for increasing their position.
*   **D: Senabahinir samne abosthaner somoy:** While they positioned themselves before the army, the passage doesn't say they *increased* their position at that moment; it describes where they initially set up.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, nicher konti Cheender sobcheye roktakto jug chhilo?","The correct answer is **B: shee'aaner jug**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Prachin Cheender itihaser roktakto juger modhye 3 kingdom 1(ek) onnotomo chhilo roktakto juger hajar hajar manush shee'aaner bhoboner prashader sorbochcho asone boste lorai kore mara giechilo."" This translates to: ""Among the bloody eras of ancient China's history, the Three Kingdoms period was one, and thousands of people died fighting for the highest position in the world during the era of She'aan.""

Therefore, the passage identifies ""shee'aaner jug"" (the era of She'aan - likely referring to the Three Kingdoms period) as the bloodiest era in ancient China.
"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Sena pipilika uponibeshguli er Jajabor doshai probesher byapare sotyi tothyo konti?","The correct answer is **C: Tara basa toiri kore ja 17 din por por poribortito hoy** (They build nests that change every 17 days).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Protiti jajaboriyo chhotachuti pray 17 din sthayi hoy."" which translates to ""Each nomadic settlement lasts approximately 17 days."" This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tara raate belay basa toiri kore** (They build nests at night) - The passage says they *travel* at night (""Jajabor doshai soina pipre raate poth chole"") and *rest* during the day (""aar diner belay bishram ney"").
* **B: Tader khabarer poriman kom thake** (They have a limited food supply) - The passage says the nomadic state *begins* when the food supply diminishes (""Jokhon khabarer poriman kome jay tokhon bosotite jajaborer moto abostha shuru hoy""), but doesn't state they *always* have a limited food supply.
* **D: Tara diner belay michhil kore** (They march during the day) - The passage clearly states they march at night (""Sena pipilika uponibeshguli michhil kore egiye jay..."") and rest during the day.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, kon bornonati Jajabor doshai cholakale Sena pipilika uponibeshguli er basa toirir swabhabik nirvulvabe protipholito kore?","The correct answer is **C: Tader protidin basa poribortito hoy**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jokhon khabarer poriman kome jay tokhon bosotite jajaborer moto obostha shuru hoy. Ei porjaye bosotiti osthayi basa toiri kore jaa protidin poribortito hoy."" This translates to: ""When the amount of food decreases, a nomadic state begins. At this stage, they create a permanent base which changes every day.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tara ratae belay basa toiri kore** (They build their base at night) - The passage says they *travel* at night, not build.
*   **B: Tara kono basa na toiri kore 17 din michhil kore** (They don't build any base and travel for 17 days) - The passage says they *do* build a base, although it's temporary and changes daily. It also says each small group stays in one place for about 17 days, not that they travel constantly for 17 days.
*   **D: Tara ei doshai cholakale ek e bosoti byabohar kore** (They use only one base while traveling this route) - The passage explicitly states the base changes daily.



"
bahirer sangketgulir uposthiti sottweo nicher konti cholte thakbe?,"The correct answer is **C: Biological clock**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Biological ghorigulote nijeswa dirghosthayi osiletor royechhe jaa bajjhik bol chhara emonki nikharchayito cycle chalanor moto samoykal dhore cholbe."" (Biological clocks have their own persistent oscillators that will run for a period of time even without external cues, like a fixed cycle.)

This means even if external cues are absent, the biological clock itself will continue to run.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Endejon chokre (Internal clocks):** While internal clocks exist, the passage emphasizes the *biological clock* as the core mechanism.  Internal clocks are affected by external signals.
* **B: Porjaykromik chhondo (Circadian rhythm):** Circadian rhythms *are* heavily influenced by external cues (like day/night cycles) as the passage mentions (""nothibhukto hoyechhe beshirbhag jiber jonno, jar modhye royechhe..."").
* **D: Porjabekkhito chhondo (Observed rhythms):** This is a general observation and doesn't represent the underlying mechanism that continues to function without external cues.



"
Kon shobdoti ekti nirdishto dhoroner bajhyik gothon boishishter bibhinno rup prodorshonkari byaktider bornona kore?,"The correct answer is **D: Bahurupi**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Bektir modhye jokhon kono nirdishto boishishter bibhinno rup dekha jay tokhon tara bahurupi hoy."" This directly translates to ""When different forms of a specific characteristic are seen among people, they are 'bahurupi' (polymorphic/varied).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Monomorphic:** The passage defines 'monomorphic' as everyone having the *same* type of external characteristics, the opposite of what the question asks for.
*   **B: Jiber:**  'Jiber' refers to the collection of organisms or species.

Ekti nirdishto bhougolik oncholer biraj kore emon projatir jiber jonno nicher kon podti sothik?,"The correct answer is **A: Monomorphic**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Jokhon kono jonogosthir modhye thaka protiti sodosyer eki dhoroner bajhyik gothon hoy tokhon tader 'monomorphic' bole."" This directly translates to: ""When every member of a population has the same type of external structure, they are called 'monomorphic'.""

* The question asks for the term describing a species living in a specific geographic area where everyone has the same characteristics. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'monomorphic' provided in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jonosongkha (Population):** While the passage discusses populations, it doesn't define the term itself. It uses population as the *context* for describing monomorphism.
* **C: projatir (Species):** The passage mentions species in the first sentence, but doesn't use it to describe the characteristic of a population within a geographic area.
* **D: Bahurupi (Polymorphic):** The passage defines 'bahurupi' as having *different* forms, which is the opposite of what the question describes."
Nicher konti prokriti-nirbhor porjoton karjokromer udahorongulor modhye pore na?,"The correct answer is **C: Biggan jadughore bhromon kora (Visiting a science museum)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) specifically describes nature-dependent tourism activities.** These include things done *in* nature, relating to wildlife and the natural environment: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and learning about flora and fauna.
* **A (Jolopropate hiking kora - Hiking to waterfalls)** is a nature-based activity.
* **B (Bonno phuler chhobi tola - Taking pictures of wildflowers)** is a nature-based activity (photography and appreciating flora).
* **D (Maach dhora - Fishing)** is explicitly mentioned in the passage as an activity within nature-dependent tourism.
* **C (Biggan jadughore bhromon kora - Visiting a science museum)** is an *indoor* activity, focused on science, and is not directly dependent on the natural environment.  It doesn't fit the description of ""prokriti-nirbhor porjoton"" (nature-dependent tourism).



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, nicher konti poribohon byabosthay bhitti?","The correct answer is **B: Bektigoto gaarir (Personal vehicles)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""এই গতিশীল শাটল পরিবহন ব্যবস্থা প্রত্যেকটি ব্যক্তিগত গাড়ির উপর ভিত্তি করে একটি পরিবহন ব্যবস্থার সাথে সংযুক্ত ও সমর্থন করছেন।"" This translates to: ""This dynamic shuttle transport system is connected to and supports a transport system based on each individual vehicle.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly states that the transport system is built *on top of* or *uses* personal vehicles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kormokkhetro (Workplaces):** While people travel *to* workplaces, the passage doesn't say the transport system itself is workplaces.
*   **C: Ekti sthitishil biosfiyarke (A stable biosphere):** The passage mentions the biosphere being threatened, but it isn't the system being built *upon*.
*   **D: Manob bibortoner (Human evolution):**  The passage links the carbon footprint to conditions suitable for human evolution, but doesn't say evolution is the foundation of the transport system.



"
Jesob kona nucleus ke prodokkhiner kore segulir ki dhoroner adhan royechhe?,"The correct answer is **B: kono adhan-e noy**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""neutron-er kono adhaan nei"" which translates to ""neutrons have no charge.""  The question asks about the charge of particles that orbit the nucleus, and the text identifies neutrons as being part of the nucleus. Therefore, the answer is that they have no charge.



"
Nucleus kon kon kona niye gothito?,"The correct answer is **A: Proton ebong neutron**.

The text explicitly states: ""Nucleus duti kona nie gothito- neutron ebong proton."" (The nucleus is composed of two parts - neutron and proton.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Neutron o electron** - Electrons orbit the nucleus, they aren't *in* it.
* **C: Electron o proton** -  Electrons orbit the nucleus, they aren't *in* it.
* **D: Proton, neutron, o electron** - Electrons orbit the nucleus, they aren't *in* it.

Binary sonkhar ke aro ki hisebe ullekh kora hoy?,"The correct answer is **A: Bit**.

The passage explicitly states: ""binary digit ba bit hisabe ullekh kora hoy"" - meaning binary digits are also referred to as bits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maaner (Value)** - While binary numbers *have* values (0 or 1), ""maaner"" isn't a term used to *refer* to them.
* **C: Bhasha (Language)** - Binary is a *part* of computer language, but not a direct alternate name for the numbers themselves.
* **D: Akare (Form/Shape)** - This doesn't relate to how binary numbers are referred to.

Here's why:

* **The passage states blogging *increases* criticism**, as students' writing is exposed to a wider audience and their peers become their biggest critics. This leads to improvement, but it doesn't *decrease* criticism.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

* **A: Byakoron o lekhar dokkhotar unnoti** (Improvement in grammar and writing errors) - The passage explicitly states initial errors are corrected with exposure and feedback.
* **C: Charpasher jogoter byapare byapok janashona** (Wider knowledge of the surrounding world) - The passage says blogging ""binds students to be more aware of the world around them.""
* **D: Protiniyoto shekhar proti anuprerona briddhi** (Increased motivation for daily learning) - The passage says blogging is a good way to motivate collaborative work and learning.

Therefore, option B is the only benefit *not* mentioned in the provided text.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Jehetu shikkharthira sobche beshi somalochok shrota hoy, tai blog-er lekhok somalochona erate nijer lekhoni aro bhalo korar dike nojor diyechen."" (Because students have the most critical listeners, blog writers pay attention to criticism to improve their writing.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Internete bibhinno upokoroner byapare ghono ghono protikriya janano (Giving a lot of feedback on various online resources):** While the passage mentions interaction with online resources, it doesn't frame *giving* feedback as the motivational aspect for writing improvement. It’s about *receiving* feedback.
*   **C: Tader dorshokder agroho dhore rakha (Keeping the attention of their audience):** The passage mentions audience engagement, but frames it as a *result* of improving writing (to be more interesting and curious) – not the primary motivator for improvement.
*   **D: Joutho bhabe kaj shekhar anuprerona deoar jonno (To inspire collaborative work):**  While blogging can *be* used for collaborative work (as the passage also notes), it’s not presented as the specific factor motivating writing skill development.

Nicher konti shikkharthider jonno osomoniyoto jogajog subidha noy? ,"The correct answer is **B: Diner jekono somoy proshikkhokder der saathe mukhomukhi sakkhater sujog** (Opportunity for face-to-face meetings with trainers anytime).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that asynchronous communication (like using the internet) *allows* students to ask questions and receive prompt replies *before* face-to-face meetings. This implies that relying on *always* having immediate face-to-face access is a limitation, not a benefit, of asynchronous learning.

Let's look at why the other options are benefits mentioned in the passage:

*   **A: Resource hisebe internet er byabohar** (Use of the internet as a resource): The passage directly states the internet provides access to information.
*   **C: badhyobadhokota na thaka karmo ghontar** (Tasks with no time constraints): The passage mentions reduced time constraints as a benefit.
*   **D: Goti niyontron** (Pace control): The passage states it gives students control over their own pace and allows them to regulate the pace of instruction.

Therefore, the passage indicates that relying on *immediate* face-to-face meetings is not a benefit of asynchronous communication; in fact, the system is designed to *reduce* the need for those in many cases.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, niche osomoniyoto jogajog er kon dikti shikkharthider jonno nomoniyo noy?","The correct answer is **B: Karmo ghontar (Action happening)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that asynchronous communication *reduces* the time pressure associated with action happening (""manansoi karmo ghontar sombhabonasoho somoyer badhyobadhokota onek kom royechhe"").  This means a quick response isn't *required* for actions, making it something *not* beneficial or emphasized in asynchronous communication.

Let's look at why the other options *are* beneficial:

*   **A: Shekhar goti (Student pace):** The passage explicitly states asynchronous communication allows students to work at their own pace.
*   **C: Nirdeshmulok upokoron (Instructor control):** The passage mentions the ability for instructors to control the pace of things.
*   **D: Internet er byabohar (Internet use):**  The passage directly highlights the use of the internet and the World Wide Web as a key component of asynchronous communication, providing access to information.

Therefore, the only option that doesn't represent a benefit of asynchronous communication as described in the passage is ""Karmo ghontar""."
Kontit ke Modhyojugiyo durgo er sathe jukto kora jete pare emon kichhu hisebe ullekh kora hoyni?,"The correct answer is **D: Knight**.

Here's why:

The passage mentions ""protijogitar chitro"" (images of competitions), ""bhojon"" (feasts), ""Arthurian shiberike"" (Arthurian camps), and ""prasader karagare"" (dungeon of the palace) as things associated with medieval castles.  Knights were a *part* of medieval life and castles, but the passage doesn't specifically *mention* them as being directly linked to what evokes the feeling of a medieval castle. The passage focuses on sights, sounds, and smells – things *found in* or *evoked by* a castle, not the people who inhabited it.

The passage explicitly states: ""Hajar bochorer purano dhongshaboshesh er modhye dariye bohu din ager **juddher** shobdo ebong gondho mone kora sohoj"" which translates to ""Standing among the ruins of a thousand years, it is easy to imagine the sounds and smells of battles of long ago"". 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bhoy (Fear):** While the passage mentions fear (""prasader karagare bhoy bere jaoar gondho paoa""), it doesn't say this is what one *imagines* within the ruins.
* **C: Bhojsobha (Feast):** The passage mentions feasts as something the ruins *evoke* (""bhojon ebong Arthurian shiberike udbuddho koreche""), but doesn’t describe it as a smell or sound imagined in the ruins themselves.
* **D: Ghorar khurer (Horse hooves):**  The passage mentions the sound of horse hooves (""rastar pathorer upore ghorar khurer thokthok shobdo pray shona""), but states that it is *heard*, not imagined.

Nicher konti Kirbi Muxlo durgotike sothikbhabe bornona kore na?,"The correct answer is **C: Durgotike nirmankaj sei somoykaler jonno sadharon chhilo na**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Er boro kacher janala ebong patla dewalguli dirghodin dhore chola sangkolpoboddho hamla protihoto korte sokkhom hoto na."" and ""1480-r doshoke, jokhon Lord Hestings dara etir nirmankaj shuru hoyechilo, tokhon deshti tulonamulokbhabe shantipurno chhilo ebong nirapotta bahini shudhumatro chhoto chhoto dakatdoler biruddhe prayojon chhilo."" This indicates that building a substantial fortification like this *was* unusual for the time, as the country was peaceful and security needs were minimal. It wasn't a typical practice.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Lord Hastings ei durger dewalguli puru korar onurodh korechhilen** - While not directly stated, the passage implies Lord Hastings initiated the construction.
*   **B: Nirmaner somoy deshti tulonamulokbhabe shantipurno poribesher jonno oti samanyo nirapottar darkar hoyechhilo** - This is directly stated in the passage.
*   **D: Eti dirghodin tike thakar jonno ebong akromon niyontron korte nirmito hoyechhilo** - The passage mentions the walls and windows were not designed for long-term defense, but the intention was there - to offer *some* protection. However, it acknowledges they weren’t very effective.

Here's why:

The passage states that Kirbi Muxlo was considered a ""safe house"" rather than a fortress, and its large windows and thin walls weren't suitable for prolonged defense. This directly implies it had *less* fortification than a typical castle of the time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Boro Janala** (Large Windows) - While the passage mentions large windows, it points out this was a *weakness*, not a design feature for defense.
*   **B: Akromon niyontron korte ekti bhit nirman** (Building a wall to control attacks) - The passage implies it *lacked* sufficient defenses for controlling attacks.
*   **D: Patla dewalguli** (Thin Walls) - Like the large windows, thin walls are presented as a vulnerability, not a deliberate construction feature.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Shiter morshume kichhu cross kantri running-soho byayaam shorirer uporer ongshoke sobche bhalo rakhe."" (Some cross country running exercise in winter keeps the upper body in the best condition.)  This directly implies that preparing with cross country running, *especially* during the warmer months, is beneficial for facing the challenges of a winter race.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Proshikkhoner somoy goti baranor chorchar dike gurutto dewa** (Focusing on increasing speed during training) - The passage emphasizes endurance and patience are more important than speed, especially for a first-time half marathon runner.
* **C: Tin minit porishrom kora** (Working hard for three minutes) - The passage mentions a runner who can manage two minutes of effort, but doesn't suggest three minutes is beneficial. It focuses on the need for *patience* and endurance, not short bursts of intensity.
* **D: Shorirer uporer ongshoke byayam er jonno gymer sodbyabohar kora** (Using the gym for upper body exercise) - While upper body strength is helpful, the passage specifically highlights cross-country running as the best preparation for the upper body demands of a winter race.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Nischitbhabe prothom-diker ekjon ordho mailar bekti jini dui minit porishrom korte paren, tar aboshyoi nirdishto maaner goti thakte hobe tobe sokol bipodei dhoirjo barate hobe.""  This translates to: ""Certainly, a first-time half marathon runner who can exert themselves for two minutes needs to have a certain amount of speed, but patience must increase in all difficulties.""

This clearly emphasizes the *importance of patience* over speed, especially for beginners.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shiter mashe cross kantri running onushilon kora (Practicing cross country running in winter):** While the passage mentions this as a good exercise, it doesn't state it's *most* important for a first-time runner.
*   **C: Dui minit er kom somoy neoa ba record kora (Taking or recording a short time of two minutes):** The passage uses two minutes as a baseline for exertion, not as a goal to beat.
*   **D: Dhoirjo er tulonay goti ke beshi guruttopurno vaba (Speed is more important than patience):** This is the opposite of what the passage conveys."
"Ekjon krirabidder kkhetre, nicher konti kebol pushtimulok obhyashguli er madhyome orjon kora jay na?","The correct answer is **C: Shreshtho kormokhomota (श्रेष्ठ কর্মক্ষমতা)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states that nutritional practices *cannot* create the *best* performance (shreshtho kormokhomota) on their own. It says they *can* significantly influence overall health, aid in improving performance, and increase enjoyment.  However, achieving peak performance requires more than just nutrition – it needs hydration and a comprehensive training regimen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Unnoto kormokhomota (উন্নত কর্মক্ষমতা)** - The passage *does* state nutrition helps *improve* performance.
*   **B: anondo barate para (আনন্দ বাড়াতে পারা)** - The passage explicitly states nutrition helps increase enjoyment.
*   **D: Samogrik susthotake (সামগ্রিক সুস্থতাকে)** - The passage directly says nutrition significantly influences overall health.

Here's why:

The passage states that proper nutrition *influences* a young athlete's overall health, *helps* improve performance and *increases enjoyment*. It specifically mentions:

*   **Nutrition practices** (pushtimulok obhyashguli)
*   **Hydration practices** (haidraeshaner obhyas)
*   **Adequate rest** (sasthokor shoktir bharsammo bojay rakha)

These three contribute to enjoyment. However, the passage doesn't directly state that *consistently demonstrating peak performance* is a factor in increasing enjoyment. While performing well *can* be enjoyable, the passage focuses on the foundational elements that enable performance and thus, enjoyment.

Therefore, option B is the one *not* explicitly mentioned as a way to increase enjoyment in the passage.

"Onucchhed onujaayi, ekjon Madhyodurotwo runner keno beshi byaybohul saronjam kinte paren?","The correct answer is **A: Eti tader byaktigoto pochhondo (It's their personal preference)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while Madhyodurotwo (middle-distance running) is a relatively inexpensive sport, many misconceptions remain regarding necessary equipment. It also says that necessary items *can* be purchased, but ""beshirbhagi mul kormokhomotar upor kono bastob probhab phyale na bollei chole"" - meaning, for most, expensive equipment doesn't actually have a real impact on performance.  Finally, it points out athletes may *feel* like they are getting an advantage, but often aren't.

This implies that runners might buy expensive equipment not because it demonstrably improves performance (options B & C are incorrect) and not because of misconceptions about necessity (option D is incorrect), but simply because they *want* to, it's a personal choice.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Madhyodurotwo dour e ki proyojon?","The correct answer is **C: Kchhu saronjam (Some equipment)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""dorkari kichhu saronjam somporke ja ongshogrohoner jonno proyojon"" which translates to ""some necessary equipment for participation."" It then clarifies that while equipment is *needed*, it doesn't significantly impact performance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bipul poriman saronjam (Large amount of equipment):** The passage doesn't suggest a *large* amount, only *some*.
*   **B: Ekti swikrito Krirha bishoyok background (An accepted sports-related background):** The passage doesn't mention anything about background or prerequisites for playing.
*   **D: Onek beshi ortho (Much more money):** The passage doesn't mention cost beyond the need to *purchase* necessary items.

(Four years after this patent was applied for, it was approved, which was the world's first patent in the field of MRI.)

"Onucchhed onujaayi, onyer sharirik karjokolaper byakhya korar jonno manushra kon bishoye drirho dharona thakte hobe?","The correct answer is **D: Bhabe** (Thinks/Believes).

Here's why:

The passage states that understanding others' physical actions requires us to effectively grasp *how they think* (bhabe), what they want (chay), what they believe (biswas kore), know, or hope for.  It's the understanding of their thought process – their *reasoning* – that's crucial for interpreting their actions accurately. The example given highlights how assumptions based on *what we think* is happening can be wrong if we don't understand the person's actual intent.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Aasha kore (Hopes):** While hope can influence actions, it's not the primary basis for interpreting them.
*   **B: Chay (Wants):** Knowing what someone wants is helpful, but doesn't fully explain *why* they are doing something.
*   **C: Biswas kore (Believes):** Beliefs are important, but again, don't fully encompass the entire thought process behind an action.

The passage explicitly states: ""Eti amader sharirik karjokolaper sombhabbo osposhto bishoyguli somadhan korte sahajjo kore."" This translates to ""It helps us solve the possible ambiguous matters of our physical actions."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ke ki aasha kore ta dharona kora:** While the passage mentions understanding what others *hope* for, it doesn't say this is what the ability to read minds *helps* us do.
*   **C: Onyo manushra ke bicharer chokhe na dekha:** The passage actually implies the opposite - we *form judgments* about others' actions.
*   **D: Oporer mon porte para:** This is what the passage *describes* the ability as being, not what it *helps* us do.

Here's why:

The passage states that AI research focuses on ""making machines that can perform tasks requiring intelligent behavior."" This directly translates to automating tasks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Porikalpona (Planning):** Planning is *an example* of what AI can do, not its overarching goal.
*   **B: Konthossor chena (Speech recognition):** Speech recognition is *another example* of AI's capabilities, but not the core purpose.
*   **C: Somoyasuchi (Problem solving):**  Similar to planning, problem solving is a skill AI develops to *achieve* its goal, not the goal itself.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, AI prayoshoi nicher kontir sathe somporkito hoy?","The correct answer is **B: Porikalpona o somoyasuchi (Planning and Scheduling)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""planning and scheduling"" (পরিকল্পনা ও সময়সূচী) as being within the scope of AI research - ""নিয়ন্ত্রণ, পরিকল্পনা ও সময়সূচী"".

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Grahok porisheba (Customer service):** While the passage mentions AI's ability to answer customer questions, it's presented as *an example* of a capability, not the core focus of AI research.
*   **C: Bigyaner kothasahitye (Literature of science):** The passage *starts* by defining AI, but the research itself isn't *about* scientific literature.
*   **D: Hater lekha chena (Handwriting recognition):** Similar to customer service, this is an example of what AI can *do*, not the central research area.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that people with a single-minded thought process (""Ekmukhi chintadhara"") are good at ""pattern mone rakhte"" (remembering patterns). It links this ability to logical thinking, problem-solving, and working in scientific fields.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kono samosya-r ekadhik sothik uttor shonakto kora** (Eliminating multiple correct answers): The passage emphasizes that this type of thinker believes there's *only one* correct answer, not eliminating multiple ones.
*   **B: Kono samosya-r jonno notun koushalgulo prayog kora** (Applying new skills to a problem): While they utilize existing skills, the passage doesn't focus on *new* skill application. It highlights using *existing* skills.
*   **C: Samosya samadhan er jonno somoy newa** (Taking time to solve a problem): The passage doesn't mention the time taken for problem-solving.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly lists the central aspects of one-sided thinking (Ekmukhi chintadhara) as:

*   Logic (jukti)
*   Reasoning (goti)
*   Accuracy (nirbhulota)
*   Verification of facts (tothyogulir sonaktokaron)
*   Reapplying existing skills (uposthit kousholgulo abar proyog kora)
*   Collecting facts (tothyo songroho kora)
*   **And crucially, the belief that there is only *one* correct answer.** (shudhumatro 1ti sothik uttor royeche)

Taking time (somoy neoa) is not mentioned as a core component of this type of thinking. While it *might* be involved in the process, it's not a defining characteristic like the others. It's a general activity, not specific to this thinking style.

Therefore, option B is the one that isn't considered a key aspect of this one-sided, analytical mindset."

*   **B: Bhru kunchkano (Frowning/furrowing of the brows)** - This *is* a facial expression and can be a micro-expression revealing negative emotions.
*   **C: Barbar chokher polok phela (Rapid blinking)** - This *is* a facial expression and can be a micro-expression indicating stress or deception.
*   **D: Thumb’s up dekhano (Showing a thumbs-up)** - This is a deliberate, conscious gesture – *not* an involuntary micro-expression.

Therefore, the answer is **D: Thumb’s up dekhano**.  Micro-expressions are about what someone *can't* control, not what they intentionally display.

Chhoto chhoto obhibbekti byakkha somporke nicher kon bornonati sotyo noy?,"The correct answer is **D: Eti antorikota mullayone sahajyo kore**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Oliver Sacks suggests this ability to analyze subtle expressions is more akin to a dog's domesticated animal instincts than a sophisticated understanding of inner states.** This directly contradicts the idea that it *helps* understand inner states (like intuition).

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

* **A: Video recording ullekhjogyo ogrogoti niye eshechhe** - The passage starts by mentioning video recording and its ability to capture micro-expressions. (Video recording brings forward significant progress).
* **B: Sothik byakkha mithya shonakto korte pare** - The text explicitly states the claim that these micro-expressions can reveal if someone is lying. (True expressions can detect lies).
* **C: Boktobyer pashapashi mukher obhibbekti byakkha kora jay** - The passage describes these micro-expressions as being on the face and related to speech. (Facial expressions can be read alongside the speaker).

Therefore, option D is the only statement *not* supported by the provided text."
Renesaan phole nicher konti aro guruttopurno hoye uthechhilo? ,"The correct answer is **B: gyan procharer (the spread of knowledge)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Prokritopokkhe, renesaan shikkhar poddhoti ebong **gyan procharer khettre ullekhjoggo poribarton korechilo**.""  (Naturally, the Renaissance brought notable changes in the field of education *and the spread of knowledge*.)

The question asks what *else* became important alongside the Renaissance. The passage directly links the Renaissance to a significant change in how knowledge was disseminated.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Bekti bisheshe patthyo mone rakha (memorizing texts by individuals):** The passage actually states this *decreased* in importance - people no longer focused so much on rote memorization.
*   **C: Patthyo mone rakha (memorizing texts):** Similar to A, the passage suggests memorization became *less* central.
*   **D: Tothyo sangroher kora (collecting facts):** While fact collection was part of it, the passage highlights the *spread* of that collected knowledge as a key shift brought about by the Renaissance.



"
"Renesaan phole, nicher kontite kom gurutwo arop kora hoy?","The correct answer is **A: Bekti bisheshe patthyo mone rakha (Memorizing texts by individuals)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bekti bisheshe patthyo mone rakhar aar kono chap chhilo na, kintu patthyo mone korar khomota aro monojog akorshon kore.""  This translates to: ""There was no emphasis on individuals memorizing texts, but the ability to understand texts and focus the mind was more attractive.""

This directly implies that the Renaissance *de-emphasized* rote memorization of texts by individuals.  The focus shifted *away* from simply remembering what was written, and *towards* comprehension and mental engagement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gyan sangroher kora (Collection of knowledge):** The passage states information gathering methods *differed*, but doesn't say the Renaissance placed less importance on knowledge collection.
* **C: Patthyo mone rakha (Memorizing texts):** This is the opposite of what the passage states. The Renaissance moved *away* from this.
* **D: Tothyo bonton (Fact description):**  The passage doesn't directly discuss a shift in importance regarding describing facts.

Nicher konti abyahoto somporko er jonno internet byabohar er onupreronar protipholon kore na?,"The passage mentions ""ব্যক্তিগত সম্পর্ক"" (personal relationships) and ""অভ্যাসতো সম্পর্ক"" (casual relationships) as new motivations for internet use, identified by Aimeyo and Myakord (1998).  It also explicitly states education and socialization as motivations.

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: Byabosayik networking (Business networking):** This isn't mentioned as a motivation in the passage. While the internet *can* be used for business networking, the passage focuses on social and educational motivations.
* **B: Poribarer sathe songjukto thaka (Staying connected with family):** This *is* a form of personal relationship, aligning with ""ব্যক্তিগত সম্পর্ক"".
* **C: Bhromon niye gobeshona kora (Researching travel):** This could be seen as a form of information seeking, perhaps relating to education or personal interest, but doesn't directly fit the described motivations.
* **D: Notun notun loker sathe porichito howa (Meeting new people):** This falls under ""অভ্যাসতো সম্পর্ক"" (casual relationships).

Therefore, the answer that doesn't fit the motivations described in the passage is **A: Byabosayik networking**. The passage focuses on personal and social connections, not professional ones.



"
Nicher konti bektigato sampriktota er jonno internet byabohar er onupreronar protipholon kore na?,"The passage discusses how the internet fosters ""personal connection"" and ""unintentional relationships."" Let's analyze the options:

* **A: Kono recipe khonja (Searching for a recipe):** This is a functional use of the internet for information. It doesn't inherently create personal connection.
* **B: Kono aalochonar board a post kora (Posting on a discussion board):** This *directly* leads to interaction with others, potential connection, and discussion, fitting the passage's description of unintentional relationships.
* **C: Swasthosebar ponyo niye gobeshona kora (Researching health issues):** While potentially leading to online communities, the initial act of research isn't about connection; it's about information gathering.
* **D: Orthayoner byabostha kora (Making financial arrangements):** This is a transactional use. While it utilizes the internet, it doesn't focus on building relationships or personal connections.

The question asks which option *doesn't* reflect the motivational factors of ""personal connection"" and ""unintentional relationships.""  **A: Kono recipe khonja** and **D: Orthayoner byabostha kora** are the most likely answers. However, searching for a recipe is a more straightforward, solitary activity.  Financial arrangements, while transactional, *could* involve some communication.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: Kono recipe khonja**. It is the most purely informational and least likely to foster the described kind of personal interaction.

Europe kobe theke khub beshi probhabito howar upor nirbhor kora bondho kore nijosso sokiyota bikash korte shuru kore?,"The correct answer is **A: Modhyojuger pray shesher dike** (Towards the end of the Middle Ages).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Modhyojuger shesher dike poschim europe taader nijosso sokiyota bikash korte shuru kore."" This directly translates to ""Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop their own sensibilities.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Baijyantainer jug cholakale** (During the Byzantine era) - The passage mentions Byzantine influence on clothing, but not as the *start* of Europe developing its own style.
* **C: Modhyojuger pray 25 bochor por** (25 years after the end of the Middle Ages) - The passage doesn't suggest a delay of 25 years.
* **D: 11 shotok er somoykaale** (During the 11th century) - The passage mentions the 10th-11th centuries regarding clothing styles, but doesn't link it to the *beginning* of Europe's own stylistic development.



"
Kiser pholasorup poshak shokto kore atkanor jonno botamer byabohar shuru hoy? ,"The correct answer is **C: Kruseder**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kruseder pholasorup poshak driro korar jonno jonogoner botamer byabohar shuru kora sei somoyer onnotomo brihottomo ek unnoyon."" This directly translates to ""The use of buttons to make clothes more fitted began during the Crusades and was one of the biggest innovations of that time.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gothik somoye (Gothic period):** While the passage mentions Gothic fashion, it doesn't link it to the *start* of button use.
*   **B: Baijyantainer jug (Byzantine era):** The passage mentions Byzantine culture *influencing* fashion, but doesn't state buttons originated there.
*   **D: Modhyojuger (Middle Ages):** This is too broad. The passage specifically points to the Crusades within the Middle Ages as the time when button use became prominent.

"Onucchhed onujaayi, nicher konti poribesher samossar karjokar dirghokalin samadhan hisebe bibechyo?","The correct answer is **A: Amitobyayi jibonjatrar upokoron porihar kora (Reducing the use of unsustainable lifestyles)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...samosyaguli aro bereche otirikto jonosongkha ebong manobjatir amitobyayi jibonjatrar karone"" - meaning problems have increased due to overpopulation and *unsustainable lifestyles*. The passage then implies that addressing the *root causes* of the problems (rather than just temporary fixes) is necessary. Reducing unsustainable lifestyles directly addresses one of those root causes.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Karjokrom (Activities/Programs):** The passage mentions *doing* work as environmental activists, but doesn't present this as a long-term solution *in itself*. It's a way to *work towards* solutions.
*   **C: Samosyaguli karon shonakto kora (Identifying the causes of problems):** This is a *step* towards a solution, but not the solution itself. The passage says we need to identify and *neutralize* the causes.
*   **D: Poribesh andoloner sathe jukto howa (Joining environmental movements):**  Similar to option B, this is a way to contribute to solutions, but not a fundamental long-term solution on its own.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that living a wasteful lifestyle (""manobjatir amitobyayi jibonjatrar"") *contributes* to the problems. The passage frames working as environmental activists, joining environmental movements, and living in harmony with nature as *treatment* (uposorgobhittik chikitsa) - ways to lessen the future pain. 

However, advocating for or praising wasteful lifestyles would be the opposite of a solution, and therefore wouldn't be considered a therapeutic approach to environmental problems.  It's part of the *cause*, not the cure.

Let's look at why the other options are considered treatment:

*   **A: poribeshkormi hoyeo kaj kora (Working as environmental activists):** The passage directly mentions this as a way to work towards a better future.
*   **B: Samossar shikorta khunje take nishkriyo kora (Finding and eliminating the roots of the problems):** The passage says this is necessary *if* we don't just want temporary solutions.
*   **D: Poribesher sathe aro bondhuttopurnobhabe jibonjapon kora (Living more harmoniously with nature):**  The passage mentions this as a way to live more in tune with the environment.



"
Europio kon deshgulo prothom juddho hoy jar mul somosya dhormiyo bishoyer poriborte khomotar bharshammo chhilo bole mone kora hoy?,"The correct answer is **D: Spain**.

The passage explicitly states that the Spanish War of Succession was considered the first war where the core issue was the balance of power, *not* religious differences. It marks a turning point away from religious wars and towards conflicts focused on preventing any single European nation from becoming too powerful.



"
Kon juddho ke majhemajhe ‘dhormiyo juddho’ hisebe bornona kora hoy?,"The correct answer is **A: Trish bochorer juddho (Thirty Years' War)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Phole, trish bochorer juddhoti chinhito hobe shesh dhormiyo juddho hisabe."" (Lastly, the Thirty Years' War will be marked as the last religious war.)

Therefore, the Thirty Years' War is described as the last religious war.



"
Niche catholic charcher kon dikti todonter aotay aseni?,"Correct answer is **B: Dharmo er mul motobadgulir songshodhon kora uchit kina**.

Here's why:

The passage states that debates were arising about the *abuse of power and wealth* within the church (অর্থ ক্ষমতার প্রাচুর্য). It also mentions a core tenet of Christian belief was using wealth to help the poor. This suggests challenges to how the church was *practicing* its beliefs, not questioning the fundamental beliefs themselves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Charcher modhye dhonsompod er bonton jothajotho chhilo kina** - The passage directly implies this was a point of contention (the accumulation of wealth was being questioned).
*   **C: Charcher modhye kkhomotar prachurjo** - The passage explicitly mentions questions being raised about the abundance of power and wealth (ক্ষমতা ও প্রাচুর্য).
*   **D: Charcher mul motobadgulir puron kora hoyechhe kina** - While the passage implies issues with *applying* the core tenets, it doesn't say those tenets were being challenged or altered.

Therefore, the question of whether to revise/reform the fundamental beliefs (songshodhon kora uchit kina) is the one *not* directly indicated as a point of contention within the Catholic Church at the time."
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Bharsali-a ke khun hoyechhilo?","The correct answer is **D: Ekjon rajrokkhir** (A royal guard).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ek somoy uttejito jonotar modhye ekjon atongkito ranir samne Bharsaiye nihoto rajrokkhir mathati duliechilen.""  This translates to: ""At one point, amidst the excited crowd, a distraught royal guard threw the head of a slain royal guard in front of the queen.""

Therefore, a royal guard was killed (and his head displayed), not the king, the queen, a vendor, or just a random member of the crowd.
"
Jonotar raja o ranir nicher konti korar jonno jor koreni?,"The correct answer is **B: Oprotyashitobhabe Bharsali theke chole jawa** (Unexpectedly leaving Versailles).

Here's why:

The passage states the King and Queen *were forced* to return to Paris from Versailles due to the protesting women. They didn't choose to leave unexpectedly; they were compelled to.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tader garite janala khola rakha** (Keeping the windows of their carriage open) - The passage explicitly states the mob *forced* them to keep the windows open.
* **C: Rajrokkhir shiroshochhed korar drishyo dekha** (Seeing the scene of the royal guards' heads being paraded) - The passage describes someone holding up severed heads in front of the Queen.
* **D: Pyarise phire jawa** (Returning to Paris) - The passage states they were forced to return to Paris.

Therefore, the only action they weren't *forced* to do was leave Versailles unexpectedly."
Nicher konti Briten-er oswabhabik nou juddher pholaphol chhilo na?,"The correct answer is **C: Antorjatik niyomke poriborton kora hoy (Changes were made to international laws)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Britain's naval blockade, while effective, *violated* generally accepted international norms. It didn't *change* international laws; it broke them. Germany hoped for a similar reaction to their unrestricted submarine warfare, anticipating a response to Britain's illegal blockade.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Germanyr o ek e juddho koushol proyog korar ichchha (Germany's desire to employ a similar war tactic):** The passage explicitly states Germany *expected* a reaction, hoping to justify their own unrestricted submarine warfare. This *was* a result of Britain's actions.
*   **B: Niropekkho jahajgulir bipoder moddhye porhe (Neutral ships were in danger):** The passage directly mentions that the blockade put neutral ships at risk. This was a direct consequence of Britain's actions.
*   **D: Joruri sorboraho prapyotar baire chole giyechhilo (Essential supplies went beyond reach):** The blockade was *intended* to cut off supplies to Germany, so essential supplies being unavailable was the *goal* of the tactic, not an unintended consequence.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the British blockade *did* put neutral ships at risk (""Somudrer sompurno ongshe kono jahaj probesh na korte parar jonno Briten antorjatik jolashoy khonon kore, ja niropekkho jahajgulir khettreo bipod deke ane."").  The blockade, by closing international waterways, created a danger for all ships, including those from neutral countries.

Let's look at why the other options are correct descriptions of the blockade:

*   **A: Eti antorjatik chuktir baire giyechhilo** (It went against international agreements) - The passage states the blockade violated generally accepted international rules.
*   **B: Eti Germanyr sabmerin juddhojatrar ke druto kore** (It sped up Germany's submarine warfare) - Germany expected a similar reaction to their unrestricted submarine warfare due to the limited response to the blockade.
*   **C: Eti Germanyr sorboraher probahe bighno ghotay** (It disrupted Germany's supply flow) - This is the primary purpose of a blockade – to hinder the enemy's supplies.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gobeshonay dekha geche je mohilara purushder theke digun sombhabona MShobar."" (Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.)  It also mentions MS is often diagnosed in young and middle-aged adults.

* **A** fits both criteria - a woman and in a typical age range for diagnosis.
* **B, C, and D** do not. B & D are too young, and C is a male, decreasing the probability.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Niyomito kajkormo kora manusher kiser jonno aro sohayotar proyojon?","The correct answer is **A: Byatha somporke netibachok dharona**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...dirghosthayi byatha ebong aswosti bodh je alada hote pare ta nie netibachok dharona na rekhe, aro utsaho daan prayojan."" which translates to ""...do not have preconceived notions about chronic pain and discomfort, and provide more encouragement.""

This directly indicates that people engaged in regular work need more support *specifically regarding preconceived notions about pain*. The passage emphasizes the need to move beyond simply assuming long-lasting pain is normal.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Pither nicher ongshe (Lower back)** - While the passage mentions lower back pain, it doesn't state that people need extra help *because* of it. It uses it as a starting point to discuss the broader issue of pain perception.
*   **C: Hotasha (Anger)** -  Anger is mentioned as a feeling *associated* with the pain, but not as something people need help with in themselves.
*   **D: Bhoy (Fear)** - Similar to anger, fear is a feeling connected to the experience, but not the area requiring additional support."
"Onucchhed onujaayi, fencing sadharonoto kibhabe khela hoy?","The correct answer is **D: Dujone khela hoy** (It is played by two people).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Khelati muloto dujone khela hoy, ekjon fencar onnojoner protidwondi."" (The game is mainly played by two people, one fencer being the opponent of the other.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ekti adhunik format e khela hoy** (It is played in a modern format) - While true, the passage doesn't define *how* it's generally played, just *that* it is modern.
*   **B: Bishwobidyaloyer porjaye** (In university level) - The passage mentions universities, but doesn't say this is *how* it's generally played.
*   **C: Olympic porjaye** (In the Olympics) -  Similar to B, the passage mentions the Olympics, but doesn't define the general gameplay.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, nicher konti obhyontorin bishokriyar sera ingit hote pare?","The correct answer is **D: Ekti prescription pill er botol** (A bottle of prescription pills).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Obhyontorin bishokriyar sera ingit hote pare **oshudhpotrer mukto adharer uposthiti** athoba ghoroa bishakto rasayonik.""  This translates to ""The best indication of internal poisoning could be the presence of a **free base of medicine packaging** or a domestically poisonous chemical.""

A bottle of prescription pills directly relates to the ""free base of medicine packaging"" mentioned as an indicator.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bomi bomi bhab o jwor** (Vomiting and fever) - While these *can* be symptoms of poisoning, the passage doesn't identify them as the *best* indicators.
*   **B: Bomibhaber o gheme jawa** (Dizziness and fainting) - Similar to A, these are symptoms but not the primary indication.
*   **C: Gurutoro khinchuni o pete byatha** (Severe hiccups and stomach pain) - Again, possible symptoms, but not the key indicator mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: hikarer kachakachi pounchhano (Reaching close to the prey)** - The passage says to approach the prey *after* observing the scene and ensuring safety.
* **C: Shikarer abosthanti lokkho korte hobe (You must locate the prey's location)** - This is a later step, after observation.
* **D: Sahajjo jonno opekkha kora (Waiting for assistance)** - The passage warns against trying to help if you get attacked, making this incorrect.



"
Nicher kon bornonati ekjon Khotigrosthotike nirikkha korar prokriyati jothajothobhabe protipholito kore na?,"The correct answer is **A: Apnar nijer aghat pawa niye chintito hoben na** (Do not worry about getting hurt yourself).

Here's why:

The passage *specifically* warns against attempting to help if you risk injury (""Jodi sahajjo korar chesta korte gie aghaat peye thaken tobe apni bishoytike kebolmatro aro kharap korar jonno achoron korte paren"").  It emphasizes prioritizing your own safety. Therefore, saying you shouldn't worry about getting hurt contradicts the passage's advice.

Let's look at why the other options *do* align with the passage:

* **B: Khotigrosther charpasher drishyo khuntiye dekha** (Examine the scene around the Khotigrostho) - The passage starts by saying you must first observe the scene.
* **C: Shikarer abosthanti lokkho korte hobe** (You must identify the victim's location) - The passage explicitly states you need to locate the victim.
* **D: Kono laal songket ache kina ta lokkhyo kora** (Look for red flags) - The passage mentions paying attention to red flags as you get closer.

Phorashi biplob er pholey twaranyito kon poribortonti shromojibi manushke upor ullekhjogyo probhab phelechhilo?,"The correct answer is **D: Ekti notun porimap poddhoti** (A new system of measurement).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Onek samajik ebong rajnoitik probhab royeche jemon **metrik poddhotir byabohar**..."" (Many social and political impacts occurred, such as the use of the metric system...).  The question asks about the impacts felt by working people. The adoption of the metric system *is* a tangible change that would directly impact many workers, particularly those in trades and industries.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Desher jonno bordhito somorthon** (Increased capacity for the country) - This is too vague. The passage doesn't specifically mention increased capacity being felt by workers.
*   **B: Classer bhittir poriborte kailabarer bhittite girutto deoa** (Falling into the abyss of caste instead of class barriers) - This refers specifically to the military, not the broader working population.
*   **C: Projatontrobade poribarton** (Transition to democracy) - While the passage mentions a shift towards democracy, it doesn't state this was *felt* specifically by the working class. It highlights equal opportunity for all men, but the metric system is a direct, practical change.

"Phorashi biplob er por, Soinobahinir ebong onyano peshay kisher bhittite sophol howar sombhabona kom chhilo?","The correct answer is **D: kailabarer**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Soinobahinir jonno eki bishoy karjokori karon sena ryanngkinger tara classer bhittir poriborte ekhon tara kailabarer bhittite royechhe.""  This translates to: ""For the soldiers, the same thing worked because instead of the barrier of class in the army, they now remained in the barrier of capability.""

This means after the French Revolution, success for soldiers (and others) was less likely to be determined by their social *class* and more by their *capability* (kailabarer).  The passage explicitly states the barrier shifted.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Orjon (Wealth):** The passage doesn't mention wealth as a barrier to success.
* **B: Classer (Class):** While the passage says class *used* to be a barrier, it states it was *replaced* by capability.
* **C: Uchchakankkha (Ambition):** Ambition is presented as something that could *lead* to success, not a barrier.



"
Kon jono-porisheba unnoto deshgulite sobcheye beshi osontosh srishti kore bole mone kora hoy?,"The correct answer is **C: Gono poribohon byabostha (Public transportation system)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Pray sobai poribohon byabostha nie abhijog korey."" (Everyone complains about the transportation system). It then contrasts this with developed countries where complaints about water quality or bridge collapses are rare.  The entire passage centers on the problems and frustrations associated with transportation systems and why they generate so many complaints.

Therefore, public transportation is the service that is most likely to create dissatisfaction, as highlighted in the provided text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Egulir protyek byaboharkarira eguli pochhondo kore** (Every user likes these) - This is the opposite of what the passage says.
* **B: Eguli paanir gunoman er moto kharap noy** (These are not as bad as water quality) - The passage *compares* the complaints to those about water quality and bridge collapses, implying the complaints *are* significant.
* **D: Odhikangsho unnoto deshgulite eguli unmukto** (These are free from in developed countries) - The passage says complaints are *less common* in developed countries, not completely absent.

Here's why:

The passage states that traffic flow is mathematically represented using three key aspects: flow, density, and speed. While driver behavior (B) influences traffic, it's unpredictable. Road maps (C) are helpful for planning, but aren't directly used in the mathematical *representation* of flow. Density (D) is *related* to flow, but doesn't define how flow is calculated.

**Road capacity (rastaghater karjokrom)** directly limits the maximum flow possible on a road.  The mathematical models for traffic flow use capacity as a fundamental parameter.  It dictates how much traffic can pass a certain point in a given time, which *is* the definition of flow.

Harshi ebong Chej tader DNA sthapon korte ki byabohar korechhilen? ,"The correct answer is **D: Bheras**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Harshe ebong Chej tader nijasso DNA-ke ekti bacteriay sthapon korar jonno **phej ba bheras byabohar korechilo**."" This directly translates to ""Harshi and Chej used **plasmids or vectors** to establish their DNA in a bacteria.""  ""Bheras"" is the Bengali word for vector (specifically, plasmids are a common type of vector used in genetic engineering).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tejoshkri phosphoraser (Fluorescent Phosphoraser):** This was used to *mark* the DNA, not to deliver it.
*   **B: Genetic Upadan (Genetic Material):** This is too broad; it's what they were working *with*, not what they used to deliver it.
*   **C: Tejashkri salfarer (Fluorescent Sulphur):** Similar to A, this was used for marking, not delivery.

miuteshan er shishur modhye porichalito howar kkhomota kiser upor nirbhor kore?,"The correct answer is **A: Jodi jarm-line kosh hoi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kebol jarm-line koshgulite je miuteshan ghote takei shishur modhye porichalito kora jete pare..."" (Only the mutations that occur in germ-line cells can be passed on to the child...).  This directly answers the question of what determines whether a mutation will be inherited by the child.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: jingato bostur upadaner gurutwo** (the importance of the organism's composition) - While the organism's composition is relevant to the *effect* of a mutation, it doesn't determine if the mutation is *passed on*.
*   **C: Miuteshan er dhoron** (the type of mutation) - The type of mutation influences its effect, but not its heritability.
*   **D: Miutashanguli kosher mrittu ghotate pare kina** (whether mutations can cause cell death) - This is a consequence of some mutations, but doesn't determine if they're inherited."
"Onucchhede bornito tothyer bhittite, miuteshan er bibhinno dhoroner probhab kisher upor nirbhar korey?","The correct answer is **B: Khotigrosto koshgulo jarm-line kina** (Whether the affected cells are germline cells).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kebol jarm-line koshgulite je miuteshan ghote takei shishur modhye porichalito kora jete pare..."" (Only the mutations that occur in germline cells can be passed on to the child...).  This means the *type* of impact (how the mutation manifests) depends on *where* the mutation occurred – specifically, whether it's in germline cells.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kototuku jingato bostur khotigrosto hoyechhe** (How much of the living organism is affected): While the extent of damage is mentioned, the passage says the *type* of effect depends on the germline cells, not the amount of damage.
*   **C: Khotigrosto jingato bostur gurutto** (The importance of the affected living organism): The importance isn't the determining factor of the *type* of effect.
*   **D: Khotigrosto jingato bostur dhoroner** (The type of affected living organism): The passage focuses on the type of *mutation* and *where* it is, not the organism itself.



"
Nicher konti prachin sangonskriti te chhagol rakhar karon chhilo na?,"Correct answer is **C: Eguli bondhur moto songo dito**

Here's why:

The passage states that goats were domesticated for practical reasons:

*   **Milk:** ""dudh, chul, mangsho ebong chamrar sahoj odhigrahoner jonno"" (for easy access to milk, leather, meat, and skin).
*   **Meat:** Same as above.
*   **Skin/Leather:** Same as above.
*   **Grazing:** They grazed in specific areas, helping manage the landscape.

The passage does *not* mention goats being kept for companionship. Therefore, option C is the one reason *not* listed in the text."
Golf er uddeshyo holo sobche kom sonkhyokbar ki newa?,"The correct answer is **B: Stroke**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Se kheloar jiten jini korsti somponno korte sobche kom sonkhyokbar **stroke** nyan ba clubti dolan."" (The player who wins is the one who completes the course with the fewest number of **strokes** or club swings.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bolgulike (Ball)** - While the ball is important, the objective isn't to get the ball itself with the fewest attempts, but to complete the course.
*   **C: Somoy (Time)** - There's no mention of time being a factor in winning.
*   **D: Gorto (Hole)** - The objective isn't just to reach the holes, but to complete *all* the holes with the fewest strokes.



"
"Golf korste, kon jaygar ghas chhoto chhoto kore kata hoy?","The correct answer is **B: Sobuj er upore** (On the green).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Khelati ghaser opor khela hoy, gorter charpasher ghas khub chhoto kore kata hoy ebong jake bola hoye thake sobuj."" This translates to ""The game is played on grass, the grass around the holes is cut very short and is called green.""

Therefore, the grass is cut short *on the green*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Atharoti gortote** (Eighteenth hole) - While the 18th hole is part of the course, the passage doesn't specify short grass there specifically.
*   **C: Prothom gorter** (First hole) - Similar to A, it's a hole, but not where the short grass is mentioned.
*   **D: Prothom gorto** (First hole) - Same as C."
Ekti boiggyanik porikkha-nirikkha r sadharon uddeshyo ki?,"The correct answer is **A: Ek k ba ekadhik sombhabbo onumanke baad dewa (To propose one or more possible hypotheses)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""borong porikkha-nirikkha holo emon ekti poddhoti ja ek ba ekadhik sombhabbo onumanke baad ditey..."" (meaning: ""experiments and observations are a method that proposes one or more possible hypotheses..."").  This directly answers the question about the general purpose of a scientific experiment/observation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bissho ki bhabe kaaj korey ta nirdharon kora (To determine how the world works)** - While this is *a goal* of science, it's not the *immediate purpose* of a single experiment. Experiments are designed to test specific ideas.
*   **C: Proshno jiggasa (To ask questions)** - Asking questions is part of the scientific process, but not the main purpose of an experiment itself.
*   **D: Boiggyanik gobeshonakeo nirdesh dewa (To direct scientific research)** - Experiments *contribute* to directing research, but aren't the primary directive themselves.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, konti boiggyanik gobeshonakeo nirdesh dite sahajyo kore na?","The correct answer is **A: Kebol boiggyanik poddhotite** (Only scientific hypothesis).

Here's why:

The passage states that a scientific hypothesis *determines* how things work, and *guides* scientific research. However, it also says that observation, proposing possible assumptions, and experimentation (porikkha-nirikkha) *also* guide scientific research.  The passage emphasizes that it's not *just* the hypothesis, but these other methods *along with* the hypothesis that direct research.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Porjobekkhon kora** (Observation) - The passage explicitly states observation guides research.
* **C: Sombhabbo onumanke baad dewa** (Proposing possible assumptions) - The passage explicitly states proposing assumptions guides research.
* **D: Porikkha-nirikkha chaliye jawa** (Conducting experiments) - The passage explicitly states experimentation guides research.

Therefore, only a scientific hypothesis *alone* doesn't fully guide research; it needs to be combined with observation, assumption, and experimentation.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Tornedo somporke kon bornonati sotyo noy?","The correct answer is **C: Odhikangsho tornado tin ghontaro beshi somoy dhorey chole**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Sobcheye hingsro dui shotangsho tornedoguli tin ghontaro beshi somoy dhorey chole"" (The most violent two percent of tornadoes last more than three hours). This means *only* the most violent ones last that long, not the majority (adhikangsho).

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Tornadoguli tader pother samosto kichhu dhongso korey ditey pare** - The passage states they ""can destroy everything in their path.""
*   **B: Tornado onyanno uddam jhorer sathe tulonay ekti chhotto oncholke aghat korey** - The passage begins by saying a tornado ""affects a small area compared to other violent storms.""
*   **D: Kichhu kichhu tornador somoy proti ghontay 300 mail porjonto bege batas e byaye cholte pare** - The passage says the winds can reach ""480 km/hour (133 meters/second; 300 miles/hour).""



"
"Onuchched onujaayi, Nicher kon bakyoti odhikangsho tornado ke jothartobhabe bornona kore?","The correct answer is **B: Eguli proti ghontay pray 480 mile bege batas srishti kore** (They create winds of about 480 miles per hour).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** "" প্রতি ঘন্টায় ৪৮০ কিমি (133 মিটার/সেকেন্ড; ঘন্টায় ৩০০ মাইল) বেগে বয়ে যাওয়া বাতাস রয়েছে"" (There is wind blowing at 480 km per hour (133 meters/second; 300 miles per hour)). This directly describes the intensity of a tornado's wind speed.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Eguli sadharonoto tin ghontaro beshi somoy dhorey chole** (They usually last more than three hours) - The passage says the *most intense* tornadoes last over three hours, not all of them.
* **C: Eguli onyanno jhorer tulonay borho oncholke aghat korey** (They impact a larger area than other storms) - The passage states they impact a *smaller* area, but can destroy everything in their path. This is a contrasting statement.
* **D: Eguli mati theke gaachh upre phyale sokkhom** (They are capable of throwing trees from the ground up) - The passage mentions trees being uprooted, but doesn't highlight this as the defining characteristic.



"
16 shotoker manush ki korte shuru korechhilo?,"The correct answer is **D: Telescopguli toiri kora** (Making telescopes).

Here's why:

The passage states ""16 shotoker shesh dike Europe-e prothom prokrito durbinguli toiri hoyechilo"" which translates to ""Towards the end of the 16th century, the first real telescopes were made in Europe.""  The rest of the passage describes *how* these telescopes worked, but the key thing that people *started to do* was make telescopes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: lenser byabohar kora** (using lenses) - People had been using lenses for a long time *before* the 16th century, as the first sentence states.
* **B: Durer bostuke aro nikote dekha** (seeing distant objects closer) - This is the *result* of using telescopes, not what people started doing.
* **C: Lens toiri kora** (making lenses) - Again, lens making predates the 16th century.



"
Manush kotodin dhore durer bostuke bordhitokoroner jonno ens byabohar korche?,"The correct answer is **C: Hajar hajar bochor dhore** (For thousands of years).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Manush hajar hajar bochor dhorey bordhitokoroner jonno lens toiri ebong byabohar korey asche."" This directly translates to ""People have been making and using lenses to aid vision for thousands of years.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ek hajar bochor (One thousand years)** - While a thousand years is a long time, the passage specifically says ""hajar hajar bochor"" (thousands and thousands of years).
*   **B: 16 shotoker theke (From the 16th century)** - The passage states the *first telescopes* were made in Europe towards the end of the 16th century. It doesn't say lens use *began* then.
*   **D: 16 shotoker suru theke (From the beginning of the 16th century)** - Same reasoning as B. The telescopes were made *towards the end* of the century, not the beginning, and lenses were in use long before.

"Onucchhed onujaayi, Muhammoder guha tar adhyattik jonker ebong mullyobodh somporke ki bole?","The correct answer is **A: Tini shanti o nirliptota ke gurutto diten (He valued peace and solitude)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states Muhammad would retreat to the cave (""noor"" mountain's ""hire"") for *dhyan* (meditation).** This implies he sought a quiet, isolated space.
* **The description of the cave emphasizes its complete disconnection from the world (""sompurno bichchinno"").**  This reinforces the idea that he valued being away from distractions to focus on his spiritual journey.
* **The cave is described as a ""ujjol protichchobi prodan korey"" (providing a bright symbol) of his spiritual inclination.** This suggests the solitude helped him connect with his spirituality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bairer kolahol dhyane sahajyo korte pare (External noise can aid meditation):** The passage specifically emphasizes the *lack* of external stimuli in the cave.
* **C: Tar khubi kom ekaki somoyer proyojon hoto (He needed very little alone time):**  The entire passage is about his deliberate and frequent retreats to isolation.
* **D: Tini dekha dewa ba shobdo shona niye chintito chhilen (He was concerned with visions or hearing sounds):** While the passage mentions the spiritual aspect, it doesn't focus on specifically *seeing* or *hearing* things – it's about the environment enabling meditation.



"
"Onuchched onujaayi, lohar kisher jonno prothom byabohar kora hoy?","The correct answer is **B: Wagon cholar poth (Wagon tracks/road)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ধিরে ধিরে eta upolobdhi hoy je trackgulo aro karjokor hobey jodi tader upore lohar ekti stip thake."" (It was gradually discovered that the tracks would be more efficient if a strip of iron was placed on them.) This directly indicates that iron was first used to improve the wagon tracks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Krosgulike (Crossings):** While crossings were used to hold the tracks together, iron wasn't *first* used for them.
*   **C: Chaaka (Wheels):** The passage mentions iron eventually being used for wheels *after* being used on the tracks.
*   **D: Rel (Rails):** The passage refers to the fully iron rail line being established in 1767, but iron was initially used to reinforce the tracks *before* becoming full rails.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, kaather chucker bodole lohar chaaka laganor byabohar shuru hoyechhilo keno?","The correct answer is **C: Eguli beshi bhar samlate sokkhom chhilo** (They were more capable of handling heavier loads).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Abosheshe kaather chucker bodole lohar chaaka lagano shuru holo."" (Finally, the practice of replacing wooden wheels with iron wheels began.)  It was previously mentioned that iron strips on the tracks made the tracks more *functional* (karjokor) and that iron wheels were placed *on* the wooden wheels initially. The implication is that iron wheels were stronger and could handle heavier loads more efficiently, which is why they were eventually adopted fully.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ghoraguloke goti beshi korar jonno** (to increase the speed of the carriages) - While the passage mentions the tracks helped with speed and carrying capacity, the primary reason for the wheel change isn't stated as speed.
* **B: Egulike beshi karjokor hobey mone kora hoyechhilo** (It was thought they would be more functional) - This is true, but it doesn’t explain *why* they would be more functional.  The increased load capacity is the reason for the functionality.
* **D: trackgulo er lohar karone egulir kkhoy hoye jachchhilo** (the wheels were being damaged due to the iron of the tracks) - The passage doesn't indicate the wooden wheels were being damaged. It implies iron was added to *improve* the system.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Romanticism er somoykale konti bektir kathamo gore tulechhilo?","The correct answer is **B: Bhougolikbhabe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Romyantikotar prosonge, **bhougolikbhabe** ghire thaka bekti somoyer songe sei elakar songe jorito ritiniti ebong songoskritir utthan ghotay..."" 

This translates to: ""In the context of Romanticism, a person **geographically** surrounded was connected to the rituals and the rise of culture of that area at that time...""

Therefore, the passage specifically highlights the importance of the *geographical* connection of a person during the Romanticism period.



"
Nicher kon bornonati Projuktigoto nirdharonbad er sadharon dharonar protipholon kore na? ,"The correct answer is **B: Projuktir bikash sangoskritik karone probhabito hoy na.**

Option B directly contradicts this statement.  The passage *acknowledges* that cultural factors *can* influence technological development.

Let's look at why the other options *do* align with the passage's general concept of technological determinism:

*   **A: Somaje projuktir probhab samajik shorter aotabukta** - This aligns with the idea that technology shapes society. (impact on societies causing social change)
*   **C: Somajer upore projuktir antornihito probhab royechhe** - This reflects the core idea that technology has inherent effects on society, regardless of intent. (inherent effects)
*   **D: Projuktigoto unnoyon rajnoitik probhab er bhittite gorhe othe na** - This is in line with the idea that technology develops on its own path, often independently of political influence. (independent of political influence)



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, nicher konti bow-tike tante hobe er sathe somporkito noy?","The correct answer is **A: Ekti norom shobdo (A soft sound)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a *down-bow* typically produces a strong, more forceful sound (""shoktishali ebong beshi jidpurno""). It contrasts this with the sound generally produced by a bow.  It doesn't say that a soft sound is *related to* which bow-stroke is being used.

Let's look at why the other options are correct associations with the described bow-strokes:

* **B: Ekti chinhoti ja dekhte stepel-er moto (A mark that looks like a staple/square):** This describes the visual representation of a ""down-bow"" mark.
* **C: Ekti shoktishali shobdo (A strong sound):**  The passage directly links this to the ""down-bow.""
* **D: Frog thekey shuru kora (Starting from the frog):** The passage specifically states that the ""down-bow"" starts from the frog (where you hold the bow).



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, nicher konti norom shobdo er sathe somporkito?","The correct answer is **A: Ekti down bo chinhoti** (A down bo chinhoti).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ekti dhonuk sadharonoto **norom shobdo utponno korey**, jokhon down-dhonuk shoktishali ebong beshi jidpurno hoy."" (A bow generally produces a **soft sound**, when the down-bow is powerful and more forceful.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: bow-tike tante hobe** - This describes *how* to use the bow, not the sound it makes.
*   **C: chinhoti V er moto dekhte** - This describes the *shape* of the 'up bo chinhoti' and doesn't relate to sound.
*   **D: Jekhane apni bo-tike haate dhorechen sei sthane** - This refers to the starting position and doesn't relate to sound.



"
Fossilguli proman korche je haat nimnolikhiter jonno prathomikbhabe byabohar upojogi hoyechhe?,"The correct answer is **C: Gotishokti**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""20 lokkho thekey 30 lokkho bochorer purono haater haarer fossilguli proman korche je kibhabe haater biborton **gotishokti** thekey dokkhotai rupayntorito hoyechhe."" 

This directly translates to: ""Fossils of hand bones 20 to 30 million years old prove how the hand evolved from **grasping power** to a more dexterous form.""

Therefore, the fossils demonstrate the hand was *primarily* used for grasping/power initially.



"
Nicher konti Shimpanjir phyalonjos nirbhulvabe byakkha kore? ,"The correct answer is **B: Egulir haat payer cheye chhoto (They are smaller than hands and feet)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Stretar phyalonjos nieo manusher haat payer cheye chhoto."" (Strata phalanges are also smaller than human hands and feet.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eguli manusher cheye Stretar (These are Stretar than humans):** The passage doesn't compare overall size, only the phalanges.
* **C: Eguli ojon bohon korar jonno byabohrito hoy (These are used for carrying objects):** The passage says chimpanzees use their hands for carrying objects, not Strata.
* **D: Eguli prathomikbhabe dokkhotai jonno byabohar hoto (These were primarily used for climbing):** While the passage discusses the evolution *from* climbing to other uses of hands, it doesn't state that Strata phalanges were *primarily* for climbing.



"
Nirbachon kon prokoroner theke jingato boichitro dur korechhe?,"The correct answer is **D: Prokashito**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Miuteshan notun jingato prokoron jukto korey ebong nirbachon etike **prokashito prokoroner modhye thekey soriye dey**."" 

This translates to: ""Miuteshan linked new genetic variations and selection removed them from **published variation**.""

Therefore, selection removed variations from the *published* variation, meaning it differentiated them.  The question asks which variation selection removed genetic differences from.



"
Jingato boichitro jog korar jonno kon prokriya dayboddho?,"The correct answer is **C: Miuteshan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Miuteshan notun jingato prokoron jukto korey ebong nirbachon etike prokashito prokoroner modhye thekey soriye dey.""  This directly translates to ""Miuteshan combines new genetic variations and selection places them within the published variations."" This means Miuteshan is the process involved in adding genetic variations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Prithakikaron (Separation):** The passage says separation *helps* bring about variations, but isn't the process of adding them.
*   **B: Punohshongjog (Recombination):** Similar to separation, it's a step *involved* but not the primary method for adding new variations.
*   **D: Prokashito (Published):** This refers to a *type* of genetic variation, not the process of creating it.

"Onucchheder totthyer bhittite, kono praimeter “protin samossa” somadhan korte nicher konti khabe?","The correct answer is **C: Ghasphoring (ঘাসফড়িং)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that readily available plant sources (like leaves and stems) are difficult for primates to digest and get sufficient amino acids from. It then *contrasts* this with animal foods (like insects - ""pinpor, domka, dim"") which *are* easily digestible and contain all necessary amino acids.  The author draws a parallel to our ancestors solving their ""protein problem"" the same way chimpanzees do now - by eating insects.  ""Ghasphoring"" (grasshoppers) are insects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jhora pataa (ঝরা পাতা - fallen leaves):** The passage explicitly states leaves are difficult to digest for protein.
*   **B: Kancha kolaite (কাঁচা কলা - raw banana):**  The passage refers to ""kolaite"" (banana stems) as a difficult-to-digest plant source.
*   **D: Phuler dondo (ফুলের ডাঁটা - flower stalks):** Similar to leaves and stems, these are difficult plant sources for protein.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, nicher kon somosyati aporiharjo amino acid er obhabe ghote na?","The correct answer is **B: Apushtir (Malnutrition)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tar upore, eti korte byartho howar abosad, **apushtir moto gurutoro shomosya barche** ebong osomoy mrittu hochche.""  This translates to: ""Moreover, it is futile to do so, a serious problem like **malnutrition** arises and sometimes death occurs.""

The passage explicitly links the *lack of essential amino acids* (resulting from difficult plant-based digestion) to malnutrition.  The other options are consequences *of* the problem, not the core issue caused by lacking amino acids:

*   **A: Hojome shomosya (Digestive problems):** The passage states it's *difficult* to digest plants, but doesn't say digestive issues *are* the problem caused by amino acid deficiency. They are a part of the difficulty.
*   **C: Abosad (Futility/Waste):**  This is described as a result of trying to solve the protein problem with plants – it's not the issue itself.
*   **D: Mrittu (Death):** Death is a *consequence* of severe malnutrition (and amino acid deficiency) – not the initial problem.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that subcultures use ""shoilir (style) and protiki byabohar (symbolic usage)"" to signal membership and connect with each other.  Fashion, trends, and slang (upobhasha) are all examples of this symbolic style.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mela-meshar cheshta korar madhyome (Through attempts to socialize/mingle):** While socialization happens *within* a subculture, it's not the primary way membership is *indicated*.
* **B: Tader charpasher prottyeker bishwaser sathe maniye newar madhyome (By agreeing with the beliefs of everyone around them):** Subcultures often *challenge* mainstream beliefs, not simply adopt them.
* **C: Samajik adorsho grohon korar madhyome (Through adopting social ideals):** Similar to B, subcultures often have their own distinct ideals that may differ from wider society.

Here's why:

The passage explains a self-fulfilling prophecy.  The child is labeled (stereotyped) as belonging to a group perceived as academically weak.  Once the child *becomes aware* of this stereotype linked to their group, they may internalize it and subconsciously act in a way that confirms the stereotype - in this case, performing poorly in school.  This isn't about *avoiding* the negative behavior (A), returning to a social environment (C), or avoiding association with others (D). It's about the stereotype *causing* the behavior.

Therefore, option B best reflects the described phenomenon.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, ekti shishura bornobadi stereotype somporke gyan nicher kontir upore probhab phelte pare?","The correct answer is **B: Tader achoron (Their behavior)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that awareness of stereotypes *influences their behavior*. It gives the example of children labeled as ""not good at school"" due to a stereotype – once they *know* about that stereotype, it *motivates* them to fulfill it (""probonota poshon korey"" - encourages the prophecy).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tara je bornobadi sonkhyaloghu ke shonakto korte chay (Who they want to identify with in terms of stereotypes):** The passage doesn't say anything about *wanting* to identify with stereotypes. It's about the impact *of* being labeled by them.
* **C: Onyanyo shishura sathe tader somporko (Their relationship with other children):** While stereotypes *could* affect relationships, the passage focuses on the internal effect on the child's own actions.
* **D: Bornobadi dharona (Stereotypical ideas):** The passage discusses the impact of *knowing* the stereotype, not the stereotype itself. The stereotype is the cause, the behavior is the effect.

"Onucchhed onujaayi, nicher konti ekti feral shishuder bere othar sathe samanjasyopurno noy?","The correct answer is **A: Swadhinbhabe bas kora (Living independently)**.

Here's why, based on the provided text:

The passage describes ""feral children"" as often experiencing abuse and neglect, leading to difficulties integrating into society. It specifically mentions they exhibit behaviors like fear of humans or disinterest in them.  This implies they *don't* readily adapt to independent living or normal social interaction.

Let's look at why the other options are more aligned with the text:

* **B: Shoktishali jogajog dokkhota (Difficulty with strong communication)** - The text implies feral children struggle with social interaction, which inherently includes communication.
* **C: Onyanyo manusher songo theke dure thakar probonota (Tendency to stay away from other people)** - The passage states they exhibit fear or disinterest in humans, leading to avoidance.
* **D: Samajik dushchinta (Social anxiety)** -  Experiences of abuse and isolation would likely cause social anxiety.

Therefore, *living independently* doesn't fit the description of a feral child's difficulties—they *need* care and struggle with basic social adaptation.

"Onucchhed onujaayi, nicher konti shishuder feral achoron nirbhulbhabe bornona kore?","The correct answer is **B: Samajiki karoner obhab theke feral achoroner srishti hote pare** (Lack of socialization can lead to feral behavior).

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""Samajikikaraner gurutto chitran korar kichhu sadharan poddhoti holo...jaa taader praptobyayoskoder saathe mishte badha daan korey."" (Some common aspects of illustrating the importance of socialization are...which hinders their ability to mix with their peers.) This clearly links a *lack* of socialization to the development of feral behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Odhikangsho feral achoron sharirik okkhomotar karone ghote** (Most feral behavior occurs due to physical limitations) - The text mentions physical disabilities as *a reason* children might be abandoned, leading to feral behavior, but doesn't say it's the *most common* cause, or that it directly *causes* the behavior itself.
* **C: Je shishuder ma babara bondi kore rakhe kebol tader modhye feral achoron dekha jay** (Feral behavior is only seen in children whose parents keep them confined) - The passage states some feral children are confined by their parents, but also mentions abandonment and children raised by animals. It doesn't limit feral behavior to confined children.
* **D: Sob feral achoron gurutoro buddhigato protibondhokotar karone srishti hoy** (All feral behavior is created due to severe mental disabilities) -  The passage mentions mental disabilities as a *possible* reason for abandonment, but doesn't claim it's the reason for *all* cases of feral behavior. It also mentions other reasons like physical disabilities and parental choice.

Here's why:

The passage describes ""Jeebika nirbahok krishi"" (subsistence agriculture) as focused on producing *just enough* food for the farmer and their family. It emphasizes self-sufficiency and using locally available resources (seeds, traditional methods adapted to the environment).

* **Option A** aligns with the passage - it's the core definition of subsistence agriculture.
* **Option B** is *opposite* to subsistence agriculture. Subsistence farming isn't about selling produce; it's about self-consumption.
* **Option D** also aligns with the passage - using locally sourced seeds is a key characteristic.
* **Option C** however, focuses on *maximizing yield* using *advanced technology*. This is characteristic of commercial agriculture, which aims for profit and isn't the goal of subsistence farming.  Subsistence farmers prioritize reliability and self-sufficiency over the highest possible output.



"
Nicher konti Jeebika nirbahok krishi chorchake nibhulbhabe byakkha kore?,"The correct answer is **A: Eti sompurnovabe ekti joibo poddhotite** (It is completely a subsistence-based practice).

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Jeebika nirbahok krishi hachche emon ek dhoroner krishi jaa **shudhu krishak ebong tar poribarer projana metanor jonno porjapto khaddo utpadon korey**"" (Subsistence farming is a type of farming that produces enough food *only* to meet the needs of the farmer and their family). This directly defines it as focused on self-sufficiency, making it a subsistence practice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Eti fosol er poriman barate ononyo poddhotite chashabad kore** (It uses other farming methods to increase crop yield) - The passage describes a method focused on *survival* rather than *increasing yield*. It focuses on adapting to local conditions.
* **C: Eti krishak der tader fosol nij nij elaka te bonton korar sujog day** (It allows farmers to distribute their crops in their local area) - The passage doesn't mention distribution; it focuses on internal consumption.
* **D: Kichhu kichhu elaka te krishak ra ekhono etir sodbyabohar kore** (Farmers in some areas still use this practice) - While the passage mentions this is still practiced in developing countries, it doesn't *define* the practice itself. It's a statement about its prevalence, not what it *is*.



"
Jadughore ghurte jawa kon bibhager bhromoner modhe porhbe?,"The correct answer is **B: Chittobinodon bhromon**.

Here's why:

The passage defines ""chittobinodon bhromon"" (recreational tourism) as travel for *aaram ebong mojar jonno* (relaxation and enjoyment) to places *niyamita protidiner jeeboner cheye alada* (different from regular daily life).  Theme parks (like places with magic shows/jadughor) fall directly into this category as they are designed for fun and entertainment, offering an escape from everyday routines.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Byabosayik bhromon (Business travel):**  This is for work-related purposes.
*   **C: Sangoskritik porjoton (Cultural tourism):** This focuses on history and culture.  A magic show, while potentially incorporating some cultural elements, is primarily entertainment.
*   **D: Bahire bhromon (Outdoor tourism):** This relates to travel focused on nature and outdoor activities.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that *chittobinodon bhromon* (recreational tourism) involves going to places ""jaa taader niyamita protidiner jeeboner cheye alada"" (that are different from their regular daily life).  Theme parks and seaside resorts are given as examples of this type of tourism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sthaniyo sangoskritir sathe nijeder gobhirbhabe jorhito kora** (Deeply connecting with local culture) - This describes *songoskritik porjoton* (cultural tourism), not recreational tourism.
*   **C: Guruttopurno landmark dekha** (Seeing important landmarks) - This isn't specifically mentioned as a defining characteristic of recreational tourism.
*   **D: Ekti nirdishto sthane itihas bojha** (Understanding the history of a specific place) - This also describes *songoskritik porjoton* (cultural tourism).

This directly translates to: ""In this example, reflecting on past entrepreneurial practices and their successful outcomes helped people overcome the fear of falling/failure and opened up new avenues for change.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sangathaner sangskritite jara probhab rekhechhen tader somporke gobhir antordrishti orjon kora** - While gaining insight into influential figures within an organization is valuable, the passage doesn't directly connect it to reducing fear of change.
*   **C: Sangathaner chalika shoktiguli abishkar kora** - Discovering an organization's driving forces is important, but not specifically mentioned as reducing fear of change.
*   **D: Sangathaner itihaser bojha** - Understanding an organization’s history provides context, but isn't directly linked to alleviating fear of change.

This translates to: ""Becoming aware of the value of an organization's success and its failures, starting with each individual within the organization, this evaluation process helps every participating person to more deeply understand the organization's values, goals, and driving force.""

Therefore, understanding history helps strengthen one's understanding of the organization's core values.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Parivartan er bhoy hras korte** (To reduce fear of change) - While the passage mentions that success stories can help with the fear of change, it's not the primary way understanding history helps.
*   **C: Sangathaner sathe jogsutro khunje ber kora** (To find connections with the organization) - The passage doesn't directly discuss finding connections.
*   **D: Uddogmulok byaboharer unnoti kora** (To improve entrepreneurial practices) - The passage uses entrepreneurial examples, but the main point isn’t about *improving* them.



"
Nicher kon bakyo Shikkhar adhunik poddhot nirbhulbhabe bornona kore?,"The correct answer is **C: Shikkhar kichu nirdishto poddhoti onnogulir cheye bhalo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Prokritopokkhe, shekhar moto cable ekti bhalo jinis nei."" (Naturally, cable like Shekhar is a good thing.) and further explains that learning happens *within* the engagement Shekhar creates. This implies that certain aspects or methods of Shekhar are beneficial compared to others.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kichhu kichhu Shikkhar obhiggota onnogulir cheye beshi upokari** - While true in general, the passage doesn't specifically *compare* the usefulness of Shekhar's engagement to other things; it focuses on Shekhar *being* good.
* **B: Sheikha te amra je jinisgulir obhiggota nite chai segulir upore gurutto dewa uchit** - This is not discussed in the passage. The passage is about Shekhar, not what we *should* prioritize in learning.
* **D: Shikkhar khetre churhanto bole kichhu nei** - The passage *begins* by saying it will offer a solution to the ""churhanto"" (challenges/shortcomings) of modern Shekhar, directly contradicting this option.



"
Nicher kon bornonati Shikkhar adhunik poddhoti ke nirbhulbhabe byakkha kore na?,"The correct answer is **D: Je gyaner amra kokhonoi proyog korbona setio sheikha guruttopurno** (Learning things we will *never* use is important).

Here's why:

* **The Passage's Argument:** The passage argues *against* learning things that are irrelevant to life or practical application. It criticizes television programs that present knowledge you'll never need (""we never build miniature cars,"" ""we never create waterfalls behind houses""). The passage champions learning through experience and real-world application.

* **Why D is Incorrect:** Option D directly contradicts this central argument.  It suggests that learning useless information is valuable, which is exactly what the passage is rebelling against.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with the passage:

* **A: Totthyo janar nanabidho upay royechhe** (There are many ways to gain knowledge) - The passage acknowledges multiple sources of information (though prioritizes experience).
* **B: Onyogulir poriborte nirdishto shikkhar obhiggota gulike ogradhikar dewa uchit** (Specific learning experiences should be prioritized over rote memorization) -  This aligns with the passage's critique of superficial learning and emphasis on understanding.
* **C: Ekti shikkhar obhiggota shikkharthi ebong uposthapito gyaner upore nirbhor kore** (A learning experience depends on the student and the presented knowledge) - The passage states ""shikkharthi ebong uposthapito gyaner modhye je obhiggota tar modhyei shikkhar prough ghote"" (learning happens within the interaction between the student and the presented knowledge).



Therefore, **D** is the only option that doesn’t reflect the core message of the passage."

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tulonamulokbhabe shanto alarm ghoriti byabohar korey sahojei apnake puropuri ghum thekey naa jagi shudhu sachetan koraa sombhob."" (Using a gentle alarm can easily wake you up consciously without fully waking you from sleep). It also suggests resetting the alarm to force you to get out of bed when it goes off again. This aligns directly with option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aabar ghumiye porhar age derh ghonta boi pora** (Reading a book for an hour and a half before going back to sleep) - This would likely *encourage* sleep, not interrupt it.
* **B: Bathroom byabohar kora ebong erpor abar ghumiye jawa** (Using the bathroom and then going back to sleep) - While getting up to use the bathroom might briefly interrupt sleep, it wouldn’t necessarily prevent you from falling back into a deep sleep.
* **D: Apnar nightstand e thaka botol theke joll pan korar jonno jaga** (Waking up to drink juice from a bottle on your nightstand) - The passage mentions diuretics like tea or coffee *before* sleep to encourage waking up to urinate. This option describes drinking juice *after* waking, which isn't the described method.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Tulonamulokbhabe shanto alarm ghoriti byabohar korey sahojei apnake puropuri ghum thekey naa jagi shudhu sachetan koraa sombhob."" This translates to: ""Using a gentle alarm clock can easily not fully wake you from sleep, just make you conscious."" It doesn't mention the intention of going back to sleep within two hours.

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurate based on the passage:

*   **A: Eti bioridom-vittik te hote pare** (This can be non-biological) - The passage mentions ""bioridom-vittik bikolpogulor modhye"" (among non-biological options), indicating this is possible.
*   **B: Er uddeshyo apnake ghum theke sompurnobhabe jagano noy** (Its purpose is not to fully wake you from sleep) - This is directly stated in the passage about gentle alarms.
*   **C: Apnar swabhabik ghumer somoykale prokriya ti ghote** (This process happens during your natural sleep time) - The passage begins by describing this happening during the natural sleep cycle (""Ghume byaghat hachche swabhabik ghumer somoy..."")"
"Mostishko proti rate sposhto swopno dekhte cheshta kore bole, konti briddhi pay?","The correct answer is **A: rem abosthagulir poriman** (the amount of REM sleep).

Here's why:

The passage states ""Protiratre komsongkhok rems er sange, je abostha tumi jothajotho ghum onubhob coro ebong tomar deho sustho hoy tha jotheshto biral hoye pore samasya howar jonno... Prabhabti nirbhar korey upner mostishko proti rate kotobar swapno dekhar chesta korey tar upor.""  This translates to: ""The fewer REM cycles you have, the more likely you are to experience intensely disturbing dreams... The effect depends on how many times your brain tries to dream each night.""

Therefore, the brain's attempts to dream are directly linked to *how much* REM sleep you get.  More REM sleep means more chances for dreams, and conversely, fewer REM cycles can lead to more intense, potentially disturbing dreams when they *do* occur.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Energy er matra (Amount of energy)** - While sleep is restorative and involves energy, the passage doesn't connect brain's dream attempts directly to energy levels.
* **C: Punaruddhar obosthar doirghyo (Length of recovery period)** - The passage speaks about REM cycles and the timing of dreams, not the overall length of recovery.
* **D: Duiti rem abosthagulir modhye somoyer prosarito doirgho (The extended duration between two REM cycles)** - The passage *mentions* time dilation *within* REM sleep contributing to disturbing dreams, but the prompt asks what drives the brain to *try* and dream more. That's the quantity of REM sleep.

Ghono ghono sposhto swopno shorirer upore nicher kon netibachok probhab phelte pare?,"The correct answer is **A: Duiti rem abosthagulir modhye somoyer prosarito doirgho** (Prolonged time within two REM stages).

Here's why:

The passage directly states that the problem arises from ""somoyer prosarito doirgho"" (prolonged time) within REM sleep stages.  This extended REM time, combined with frequent awakenings, is what leads to the feeling of exhaustion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Proti rate hraskrito rem** (Reduced REM per night): The passage doesn't mention a *reduction* in REM, but rather an *extension* of it.
* **C: Swachcho swapno er upore nirbhorota** (Dependence on vivid dreams): While vivid dreams are part of the issue, the core problem is the duration of REM sleep.
* **D: Proti rate rem briddhi** (Increased REM per night):  While related to ""prosarito doirgho,"" this isn't the *cause* of the problem described, the prolonged time *within* those stages is.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""adrishya team holo porichalonkari team jaate prottekti sadasya report korey."" (The invisible team is the managing team to which every member reports).  This applies to *both* the traditional ""procholito dol"" (traditional group) and the ""Virtual dalguli"" (virtual group).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ubhoy dalguli eki porjayer perform korbe bole asha kora hoy** (Both groups are expected to perform the same tasks) - The passage doesn't mention whether they perform the same tasks, only how they're organized.
* **B: Ubhoy dalguli tader protidinkar routine e bibhinno porjayer bektiswadhinata pay** (Both groups have personal freedom in different tasks in their daily routine) -  The passage states the *virtual* group has more individual freedom because they can connect at different times and locations, not the traditional group.
* **D: Ubhoy dalguli eki somoy anchal a kaj kore** (Both groups work in the same time zone) - The passage specifically mentions the virtual group can connect across different time zones, making this incorrect.

Here's why:

The passage states the ""adrishya team"" (invisible team – the management) *fixes the self-respect* for each member of the virtual team. This implies physical teams *don't* have their self-respect ""fixed"" for them, suggesting they generally *have* higher self-respect already.  Therefore, option A is the statement *not* supported by the text.

Let's look at why the other options *are* true, based on the passage:

*   **B: Virtual dol prayoshoi procholito doler jonno jogajoger point hisebe kaj kore (Virtual teams often act as a connection point for the operating team)** - The passage states ""Virtual doler sadasyara prayi taader tatkhonik bastob shakha jogajoger point hisabe kaaj korey"" (Virtual team members often act as a connection point for their immediate physical branch).
*   **C: Procholito doler virtual doler tulonay kom bektiswadhinata thake (Physical teams have less individuality than virtual teams)** - The passage states ""Taader prayashai procholito doler sadasyader cheye beshi bektiswadhinata thaake"" (They have more individuality than members of the operating team).
*   **D: Virtual dalguli somoy anchal er bhinnotar karone subidha pay (Virtual teams benefit from differences in time zones)** - The passage says virtual teams can ""milit hote paare jaa hoyto taader sthaniya byabosthapona dwara bojha jabena"" (meet at different times which may not be understood by their local arrangements) - indicating an advantage from time zone differences.

Nicher konti connontent tottogulor lakshya er aotabhukto kichhu noy?,"The passage states that content (or satisfaction) aims to identify what ticks people or what they seek to find rewarding. It also mentions that these desires are created within people as they mature and are influenced by their environment, pushing them to do or not do certain things.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Notun akankkha ja porinoto boyase eshe purnota pay (New desires that are fulfilled as one matures)** - This aligns with the passage's idea that desires are created and fulfilled with maturity.
*   **B: Karo poribesher jinisguli take tar kajke kibhabe probhabito kore (How things in someone's environment influence their work)** - This directly relates to the passage's mention of the environment influencing actions.
*   **C: Porinoto boyoser sathe sathe ontornihito chahida srishti (The creation of inherent desires with maturity)** - This is also directly aligned with the passage's core idea.
*   **D: Manusher pochhondo bojha (Understanding people's preferences)** - While understanding preferences *could* be part of identifying what ""ticks"" people, the passage focuses on deeper desires and motivations, not simply superficial preferences. It's about finding what is rewarding and fulfilling, which is more than just knowing what someone *likes*.

Therefore, the answer is **D: Manusher pochhondo bojha**. It's the least directly related to the core goal of identifying deeper motivations and rewards as described in the passage."
Nicher konti rule off thirds-er lokkhyobostu noy?,"The correct answer is **B: Ekti chhobir modhye jibon o shokti srishti kora (Creating life and energy within a picture)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the Rule of Thirds as a *guideline for composition* – specifically, dividing an image into nine equal parts with lines and using the intersections as focal points.  It's about *where* to place elements to achieve a more visually appealing and balanced composition.

Let's break down why the other options *are* related to the Rule of Thirds:

*   **A: Ekti ekti sahaj diknirdeshika toiri kora jekhane bishoyti sthapon kora jay (Creating a simple guideline where subjects can be placed):** This is a direct description of what the Rule of Thirds is.
*   **C: Bishoytike ekti sunirdishto o karjokori sthane rakha (Placing the subject in a specific and effective location):** The Rule of Thirds aims to help you place your subject strategically.
*   **D: Ekti chobir modhye kromer niyontron toiri kora (Creating control of composition within a picture):** The Rule of Thirds is a compositional tool.

Option B, however, talks about creating ""life and energy."" While good composition *can* contribute to a feeling of life and energy, that's a broader artistic goal, not the specific *purpose* of the Rule of Thirds. The Rule of Thirds is a technical guideline, not a guarantee of emotional impact.

    This means it *was* very influential, but the passage *doesn't* say it's currently one of the *most popular* formats globally. It highlights its historical significance and its influence on digital formats, not its current widespread use.

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned in the passage:

*   **A: Eti ekhono production e royechhe** (It is still in production) - The text explicitly says ""eti ekhono toiri koraa hoy"" (it is still made).
*   **B: Eti uttoradhikar sutre digital camer format dwara grihito hoyechhe** (It has been adopted by digital camera formats) - The passage says ""er anupayt jaa uttoradhikar sutre digital camera image censor formatguli peyeche"" (its aspect ratio has been adopted by digital camera image sensor formats).
*   **C: Onek sadharon format er tulonay etir bhinno akritir onupayt royechhe** (Its aspect ratio remains different from many common formats) - The passage states the specific dimensions and explains how the aspect ratio (3:2) is derived and different from others.

This directly translates to: ""The problem of achieving higher quality in lens production has decreased. This has allowed zoom lenses to produce images of comparable quality to lenses with fixed focal lengths.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Egulir ucchotoro lenser goti royechhe** (Their highest lens speed has remained) - The passage actually states that zoom lenses *generally have lower* maximum apertures.
*   **B: Swalpo-aloke poribeshe eguli byabohar kora sohoj** (They are easy to use in low light) - The passage states the opposite – low light use is *difficult* without a flash.
*   **D: Prime lenser tulonay egulir fokaser jotilota kom** (Their focusing complexity is less than prime lenses) - The passage states that zoom lenses *have* focusing complexity as a disadvantage, not that it's less.



"
"Onucchheder totthyo onujaayi, Kokhon prime lenser poriborte zoom lens grohonjogyo?","The correct answer is **B: Jodi apni kom lens upokoron chan** (If you want fewer lens accessories).

Here's why:

The passage states that zoom lenses, while having drawbacks, have become more viable due to advancements in lens production. It implies they are preferable *because* they reduce the need for multiple prime lenses.  The passage says zoom lenses require numerous lens elements to achieve a range of focal lengths, making them larger than primes. This suggests a convenience factor – one zoom lens can replace several primes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jodi sorbadhik aperture aodhikar pay** (If you prioritize a larger aperture): The passage explicitly states zoom lenses generally have *smaller* apertures than prime lenses.
*   **C: Jodi apni tulonamulok ondhokar poribeshe flash byabohar korte chan** (If you want to use flash in relatively dark environments): The passage says the smaller aperture of zoom lenses makes them *harder* to use in low light *without* flash.
*   **D: Jodi apni aro beshi fokaser jotilota chan** (If you want more focusing brightness): The passage states focusing brightness is a *disadvantage* of zoom lenses.

(Mysticism is generally a personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, especially focusing on peaceful, insightful, happy, or even transcendent experiences, distinct from other religious beliefs and practices.) This means achieving a peaceful and supremely happy state *is a characteristic* of mysticism, but isn't the *defining* feature or a description of what it *is*.  It's a result, not the core.

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurate descriptions based on the passage:

* **B:** The passage directly mentions the search for spiritual insight/understanding (""adhyattik sotto er socheton obogoti sondhan"").
* **C:** The passage states mysticism involves exploration of concepts like immortality (""amaratwa er bastobota"").
* **D:** The passage emphasizes that mystical experiences are personal and can be distinguished from other religious beliefs and practices (""anyanno dharmiya biswas ebong upaysonar sathe tulona kora jay"").

Therefore, option A is the only one that isn't a core, defining aspect of mysticism as described in the passage. It's a *potential outcome*, not the essence of the practice."

The passage states: ""Tottoti ei dharonati sthapon korey je maorir manoos polynesia thekey ekti greet fleete shore ese moriri thekey sarie newjealandke nie jaa ebong ek krishi samaj sthapon korey."" (It was believed that the Maori people came from Polynesia in a great fleet, settled all of New Zealand, and established an agricultural society.)

While the passage later discusses the Moriori and their independent culture, it explicitly states the *Maori* were the ones who initially established the agricultural society.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Je dol mao shikar korto tara kon sthaner prothom basinda?","The correct answer is **B: New Zealand**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Unish ebong quie shotoker deergho somoy dhorey etaa biswas koraa hoye aschilo jee, newjealander prothom jonojati chhilo maora sampradaaer manoos, jaanra moaa name ek daityakar pakhi shikar korey khet."" 

This translates to: ""For nineteen and twentieth centuries it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori people, whose ancestors hunted giant birds (moa).""

Therefore, the group that hunted (moa) were the first inhabitants of **New Zealand**.



"
Kon poristhitite folder er jonno Peorland poddhotir sodbyabohar kora subidhajonok?,"The correct answer is **B: Je folder er unnoto motor dokkhota royeche** (For folders who have limited motor skills).

Here's why:

The passage states Peorland origami was created by John Smith ""toiri koraa hoyechilo"" to help people with ""simito motor dokkhota"" (limited motor skills) in the 1970s. It's designed for people who can only manage a single fold.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Je folder er ekbare ekadhik bhanjgulir korar dorkar hoy** (For folders who need to make multiple folds at once) - Peorland origami is *specifically* for those who can only do *one* fold.
*   **C: Folder emon origami toiri korchhe jate ulto bhanjgulir dorkar** (Folder is making origami that requires reverse folds) - The passage explicitly says reverse folds are *not* allowed.
*   **D: Folder age kebol ek ba duibar eti cheshta korechhe** (Folder has only tried it once or twice before) - The passage doesn't mention experience level, only motor skills.



"
Nicher konti Peorland origami ke nirbhulbhabe bornona kore na?,"The correct answer is **B: Ei poddhotite utlobhanjgulir ontorbhukto noy** (This method does not include reverse folds).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that reverse folds are *not* allowed in Peorland origami. Option B claims the method doesn't include them, which is accurate and therefore doesn't describe the origami incorrectly. The question asks which option *doesn't* accurately describe Peorland origami.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Eti obhiggo folder er jonno udbhabito hoyechhe** (It was developed for experienced folders) - The passage says it was created to help people with limited motor skills, not experienced folders. So this is a misrepresentation.
*   **C: Bhanjgulir oboshoyi sorol abosthan thakbe** (The folds must be in a straight line) - The passage mentions all folds are in a straight line, meaning this is accurate.
*   **D: Simito motor dokkhota royeche emon folder der jonno eti ekti bhalo poddhoti** (It is a good method for folders with limited motor skills) - The passage states John Smith created it specifically for this purpose. So this is also accurate.

Therefore, **B** is the only option that *doesn't* align with the information provided in the passage and correctly answers the question."
"Onucchhed onujaayi, kon sthanti Sindhu sabhyata er sathe songjukto noy?","Correct answer is **B: Saraswati nadir**.

Here's why:

The passage states that some scholars *suggest* the civilization should be called Indo-Saraswati because of the presence of the now-dry Saraswati river. However, it's presented as a debated point, not a definitive part of the Sindhu (Indus) civilization's location.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: Harappa** - The passage mentions ""Harappa"" and ""Harappan civilization"" as related to the Indus civilization.
*   **C: Uttor-purbo afghanistaner kichhu anchalke ghire** - The passage explicitly states the civilization was located in parts of north-eastern Afghanistan.
*   **D: Adhunik-pakistaner odhikangsho** - The passage states the civilization covered a large part of modern-day Pakistan.

Therefore, the Saraswati river is the only option that isn't directly and definitively linked to the location of the Sindhu civilization according to the text."
Nicher konti Onucchhede alochito tamrojuger sabhyata jonno ekti sombhabyo nam hisebe ullekh kora hoyni?,"সঠিক উত্তরটি হল: A: Harappan সভ্যতা।

কারণ:

"Onucchhed onujaayi, nicher kon kormophol dirghameyadi subidha day?","The correct answer is **A: Onyoder sahojogitar kora (Collaborating with others)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Aasha kori, beshirbhag lokera onubhob korte paraben je onnoder saathe eksathe kaaj koraa taader dirghameyadi sera bikalpa."" (I hope most people will experience that working with others is their best long-term option).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nijer swarthoporota ogradhikar dewa (Giving priority to one's selfishness):** The passage acknowledges selfishness exists, but doesn't suggest it's beneficial long-term.
* **C: Konti sonkhyaloghuke sankhyagarishtha er tulonay beshi suvidha debe tar upor jor dewa (Focusing on giving more benefits to a smaller group compared to the majority):**  The passage points out how selfishness *can* exploit cooperation for short-term gain, but doesn't advocate for it.
* **D: Lobh upokari hote pare ta sweekar kora (Accepting that greed can be beneficial):** The passage acknowledges greed exists, but doesn't frame it as a positive thing.



"
"Onucchhed onujayi, Keo tatkkhonik suvidha ke gurutto dile se nicher kontike ogradhikar debe?","The correct answer is **D: Swarthoporota (Self-interest)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that greed (lobh) and self-interest (swarthoporota) *always* accompany us and that cooperation happens when self-interest can be *slightly* increased by working with others.  This implies that someone prioritizing immediate benefit will be driven by self-interest. The passage contrasts this with the long-term benefits of cooperation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Niswarthota (Selflessness):** The passage explicitly discusses self-interest, not selflessness.
*   **B: Ekotre kaj kora (Working together):**  While the passage ultimately advocates for cooperation, it explains cooperation *as a result of* self-interest, not as something someone prioritizing immediate benefit would choose.
*   **C: Sahojogitar (Cooperation):** Similar to B, cooperation is the outcome, not the driver, for someone focused on immediate gains.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, juddho byay er ullekhjogyo ongsho ke bohon korechhilo?","The correct answer is **D: Philipino jonogon**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Phillipineser bijoy hisabe markin samrajyobader juddho byay philipino jonogon nijerai diyechilo"" which translates to ""The Filipino people themselves paid for the war expenses of the American empire as a result of the Philippine victory.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Philipino sarkarke:** While the government was involved, the passage states the *people* paid.
*   **B: Wall Street banking:** They were involved in creating confusion about bonds, but didn't bear the cost of the war.
*   **C: Markin ouponibeshik sarkarke:** They *received* the funds, they didn't pay the expenses."
Templersder juger age kon somoykal eshechhilo?,"The correct answer is **C: Modhyojuger suchona er dik**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the High Middle Ages (the time of the Templars) came *after* the Early Middle Ages and *before* the Late Middle Ages. The passage also states the High Middle Ages ended around 1500 with the Renaissance. Therefore, the time *before* the Templar period would be the period leading up to the High Middle Ages, which is described as the beginning of the Middle Ages, or ""Modhyojuger suchona er dik"" (the beginning of the Middle Ages).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Modhyojuger shesh dik** - This refers to the *end* of the Middle Ages, which came *after* the Templar period.
*   **B: 12 tomo shotoker** - The 12th century falls *within* the High Middle Ages, not before it.
*   **D: 13 tomo shotoker** - The 13th century also falls *within* the High Middle Ages."
Templersder juger pore kon somoykal eshechhilo?,"The correct answer is **A: Modhyojuger shesh dik** (The end of the Middle Ages).

Here's why:

The passage states that the High Middle Ages (the time of the Templars - 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries) came *after* the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.  Therefore, the period following the Templar era was the end of the Middle Ages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 12th century:** This was *during* the Templar era, not after.
* **C: Uchcho modhyojuger (High Middle Ages):** This is the era *of* the Templars, not what came after.
* **D: 11th century:** This was also *during* the Templar era, not after.

The passage mentions:

*   **Morphine and scopolamine** for pain relief.
*   Techniques to stop bleeding from wounds (**raktapat thekey banchano**) and control blood flow (**dhamani bandhani thekey shirao rokto probaher jonno byabachhede dokkho hye othe**).
*   Surgical procedures (**pochoner jaygay byabachhede kora**).

However, the passage **does not** mention any treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using various analgesics. Therefore, option A is the correct answer as it describes a medical practice *not* mentioned in the text."

dekhar khomota kisher upore nirbhar kore?,"The correct answer is **B: Kono Pranir prayojaniyatar (Depending on the needs of the animal)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Pranir prayojaniyatar upor nirbhar korey nana storer jotilotasoho choker onek vinno vinno gathon royeche.""  This translates to ""Depending on the needs of the animal, the structure of the light-sensitive layer of the eye varies greatly.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Visual system sangbedak ongo (Visual system sensory organ):** While true, the passage says vision *depends* on the sensory organ, but doesn't say the capability *is* the sensory organ itself.
* **C: Nirdishto torongodoirghogulir saathe sahoje onubhobonshil (Sensitivity to specific wavelengths):** The passage mentions wavelength sensitivity, but as *a characteristic* of the vision, not what it fundamentally *depends* on.
* **D: Tikhnotar bivinno matra (Different levels of sharpness):** Similar to C, sharpness is a quality *of* vision, not what determines its basic capability.



"
Pranir modhye chokher gathon er bivinno kiser upor nirbhor kore?,"The correct answer is **B: Kono Pranir prayojaniyatar (The needs of the animal)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Pranir prayojaniyatar upor nirbhar korey nana storer jotilotasoho choker onek vinno vinno gathon royeche."" (The structure of the eye varies greatly depending on the needs of the animal). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Torongodoirghogulir proti onubhobonshil (Sensitivity to wavelengths):** While the passage mentions sensitivity to different wavelengths, it's a *characteristic* of the eye structure, not the reason *why* the structure differs between animals.
* **C: Tikhnotar matra (Degree of sharpness):**  Similar to wavelength sensitivity, sharpness is a capability *resulting* from the structure, not the underlying cause of variation.
* **D: Pranir jotilotasoho (Intensity of light for the animal):** The passage mentions light intensity as a factor relating to eye structure, but the primary driving force is the animal's needs.

"Onucchhed onujaayi, kon bornonati Sheikh dharma  somporke sothik chitro tule dhore na?","The correct answer is **B: Sheikh dharma e guru ek moulik bhumika palon koren**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sob bharatio dhormei guru ek moulik bhumika palon koren, *kintu sheikh dhorme tar abosthan etoi tatporjopurno je tha sheikh dhormobiswaser mull kendra*."" (All Indian religions give a fundamental role to the guru, *but in Sikhism that position is so intense that it is the central point of Sikh belief*).

This means while gurus are important in *all* Indian religions, they are *especially* central to Sikhism – more so than in other religions. Option B states it as if Sikhism merely *has* a fundamental role for gurus, which isn't the nuanced meaning of the passage.  The passage emphasizes the *unique importance* of the guru in Sikhism.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Hindu motobader samprodayik bibhajan thekey Sheikh dharma er jonmo hoy** - The passage directly states this: ""punjab anchale hindu motobader samprodayik bibhajan thekey 15 shatabdir somokokale etir utthan hoyechilo."" (Sikhism arose in the Punjab region from Hindu religious divisions around the 15th century.)
*   **C: Ei dharma er probortok, guru nanok er por 9 jon guru taanke anusaran korechilen** - The passage confirms this: ""15 shotoke guru nanok (1469-1539) chhilen ei dharma probortok. Porobortite aro 9 jon guru taanke anusaran korechilen."" (Guru Nanak (1469-1539) was the founder of this religion. Subsequently, 9 more gurus followed him.)
*   **D: Sheikh dhorme kichhu nirdishto oitijhyer utpotti Hindu dhorme hoyechhe** - The passage states: ""Shikhra money korey taader dharma hindu dharma thekey vinno jodio taaraa er hindu mull ebong oitijjoke sweekar korey."" (Sikhs believe their religion is different from Hinduism, although they accept its Hindu roots and traditions.)



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, nicher konti sheikh dhorme bishwas byabosthar mull dik hisebe bibechito hoy?","The correct answer is **A: Gurur dharona (The concept of the Guru)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sheikh dharmabalambira taander dhormoke **gurumat** bolen, panjabi bhasha jaar ortho """""""" **gurur path** """""""". Sob bharatio dhormei guru ek moulik bhumika palon koren, kintu sheikh dhorme tar abosthan etoi tatporjopurno je tha sheikh dhormobiswaser mull kendra."" 

This translates to: ""Sikhs call their religion **Gurmat**, the Punjabi meaning of which is ""**the path of the Guru**"".  While the Guru plays a fundamental role in all Indian religions, in Sikhism their position is so important that they are the central point of Sikh beliefs.""

Therefore, the concept of the Guru is considered the central tenet of the Sikh faith according to the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hindu motobader:** While the passage mentions Sikhs accepting Hindu roots and traditions, it doesn't state this *is* the central belief.
*   **C: Onnyanyo bharotiyo dharma ke swikriti na dewa (Not accepting other Indian religions):** The passage doesn't mention anything about rejecting other religions.
*   **D: panjabi bhasha te kotha bola (Speaking in Punjabi):**  Punjabi language is mentioned as the language *of* Gurmat, but it's not the core belief itself.

"Onucchhed onujaayi, Monojog ghatti byadhi te akranto sisura kontite gurutto dite giye kothin somoy par kore?","The correct answer is **A: Bidyalorer porashonar (Studying)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Add akranto shishuder bidyalorer porashonar moto bishoye mononibesh koraa khubi kathin hoye jaa..."" which translates to ""It is very difficult for children affected by this condition to concentrate on things like studying...""

The passage specifically highlights studying as a difficult area for children with this condition, making it the correct answer. The other options (khela - playing, cartoon dekha - watching cartoons, and tara je bishoygulite upobhog kore - things they enjoy) are mentioned as things they *can* focus on, not things they struggle with.



"
"Onucchhed onujaayi, Monojog ghatti byadhi te akranto sisura keno jhunkipurno achorone jorhito hote chay?","The correct answer is **D: Tader mostishko uddipto korte** (To stimulate their brains).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""…taader mostishkoke uddipto korte taaraa """"""""jhunkipurno achorone jadaa, lorai korey, ebong kortripokkhoke chyalenj janay"""""""", kenona sadharan poddhotite taader mostishko uddipto hoy naa."" 

This directly translates to: “…they resort to ‘risky behavior, fight, and challenge surroundings’ to stimulate their brains, because their brains don’t get stimulated by normal procedures.”

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Otisakriyota hras korte** (To reduce hyperactivity) - While risky behavior *might* be a way to release energy, the passage doesn't state this is the *reason* for it.
*   **B: Somoboyosider sathe jukto howai sahajyo pete** (To easily connect with peers) - The passage actually points out difficulties in social interaction.
*   **C: Tader ma babar monojog pete** (To get their parents’ attention) - The passage doesn't mention this as a reason for the behavior.



"
"Onucchheder totthyo onujaayi, nicher konti scaffolding er udahoron noy?","The correct answer is **C: Ekti swotontro porhalekhar program (An independent reading program)**.

Here's why:

The passage defines scaffolding as temporary support to help someone learn a new skill – like using a computer program or starting a new project. It emphasizes *assistance* while learning.

Let's look at each option:

*   **A: Kono computer game er shurute tutorial (A tutorial at the beginning of a computer game):** This *is* scaffolding. Tutorials guide you through new game mechanics, providing support until you understand how to play.
*   **B: Ekjon SAT tutor (An SAT tutor):** This *is* scaffolding. A tutor provides personalized guidance and support to help you improve your SAT score, gradually reducing assistance as you learn.
*   **D: Ekti chhoto league coach (A little league coach):** This *is* scaffolding. A coach teaches fundamental skills and strategies, offering support and encouragement as players develop.
*   **C: Ekti swotontro porhalekhar program (An independent reading program):** This is *not* scaffolding.  An independent reading program provides materials, but doesn’t offer direct, temporary support to *learn* how to read. It expects the reader to already possess the skills and simply practice them.  It doesn't actively *help* overcome immediate difficulties while learning a new skill.

Therefore, an independent reading program doesn’t fit the definition of scaffolding as presented in the passage."
Nicher konti scaffolding er dharonake nirbhulbhabe bornona kore na?,"The correct answer is **B: Eti shikhon poddhotir tulonay beshi sahayata pradan kore** (It provides more assistance than traditional teaching methods).

Here's why:

*   **The passage states scaffolding is a *support* system.** It's designed to help learners gradually achieve independence, not to do the work *for* them. It's about providing temporary assistance, not overwhelming help. The text indicates it’s a step *beyond* traditional teaching, not a replacement that provides *more* assistance.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Scaffold virtual bhabe uposthit thakte pare** (Scaffolding can be present virtually) - The text explicitly mentions ""Virtual scaffoldgulo"" (Virtual scaffolds) and examples like the Microsoft Office paperclip.
*   **C: Ekti prokolpo bhittik shikkhar nameo porichito** (It's known as a project-based learning tool) - The first line directly relates scaffolding to ""Prokolpobhittik shekhanor poddhotite"" (project-based learning methods).
*   **D: Kono shikkhar obhiggota shurute sahayata pradan korar jonno scaffoldgulo byabohar kora hoy** (Scaffolds are used to provide assistance at the beginning of learning) - The passage states scaffolding helps those ""jaanra notun kono computer program byabohar koraa baa kono notun prokolpo shuru korar moto notun shikkhar obhiggota orjon korchen"" (who are trying to learn a new computer program or start a new project). This clearly indicates initial support.

"Onucchhed onujaayi, Jeshob shikkharthider pothon niye samasya porey tader kon Myspas baisishtya ti subidha dite pare?","The correct answer is **A: Adalbadal koraa (Customization/Adalbadal means being able to change things)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""eti padaa sahaj korey **tulte adalbadal koraa jaa** ebong pochondo moto beshi baa samanno rongo jog koraa jaa."" This translates to ""it makes it easy to **customize** and add more or similar colors.""  This directly addresses the need of students who have difficulty with keyboards or typing, as customization allows them to adjust the page to their preferences, potentially making it easier to navigate and use.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Blog:** While blogs are a feature of the website, the passage doesn't link them to helping students with difficulties typing.
*   **C: Ekti web thhikana (A web address):**  A simple web address is convenient, but doesn't solve the problem of typing difficulties.
*   **D: 54 million profile:** The number of profiles is irrelevant to a student's ability to use the website with typing challenges.

"Onucchhed onujaayi, nicher konti shromiker danga er proti kruscheverer protikriyar ongsho chhilo na?","The correct answer is **C: Majuri hraser briddhi**.

Here's why:

The passage states the workers were protesting *against* wage cuts (majuri hraser biruddhe protibad). Kruschev's response included concessions (some demands were met - ""kichhu orthonoitik daabee thekey shore esechilen"") and appointing a new Prime Minister (Gomulka). He also sent tanks to potentially suppress the uprising (""srinkhala firiye anar jonno tank preron korechilen""). 

Increasing wage cuts (majuri hraser briddhi) would be the *opposite* of addressing the workers' grievances, and therefore not part of Kruschev's reaction.
"
Nicher konti polyande danga er karon chhilo na?,"The correct answer is **D: Oladisla gomulka-ke niojito kora**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Kruschev *agreed* to appoint Władysław Gomułka as the new Prime Minister *as a result* of the protests, not as a cause of them. The danga (riots) were *against* the existing conditions, and Gomułka's appointment was a concession made to quell the unrest.

The other options were all causes of the protests:

*   **A: Communisme:** The protests evolved into a broader protest against communism.
*   **B: Khaddo sangkat:** Food shortages were a direct cause of the worker protests.
*   **C: majuri hraser:** Wage cuts were another direct cause of the worker protests.

Therefore, the appointment of Gomułka was a *result* of the danga, not a *cause* of it."
"Onucchhed onujaayi, nicher konti soviet union ebong americar er somporke probhab pheleni?","The correct answer is **D: System niye koloho** (Disagreement over systems).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that after WWII, disagreements over ""system, prokriya (processes), and sanskriti (culture)"" led to conflict between the countries. This disagreement over systems is the primary driver of the Cold War mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sangskritik parthokyo (Cultural differences)** - While cultural differences were *part* of the conflict, the passage highlights disagreement over *systems* as the main issue.
*   **B: Germany er bishoye motamot (Agreement on Germany)** - The passage doesn't mention agreement on Germany; it only states Germany was a primary enemy *during* WWII.
*   **C: Prokriyar boisaddrishyo (Similarity of processes)** - The passage says disagreements over processes led to conflict, not similarities.



"
Nicher konti sampurna shorire snaibik spondongulo pathanor uddeshyo ke nibhulbhabe bornona kore na?,"The correct answer is **A: Rokter probahoke dhir kora (Slow down blood flow)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses throughout the body. These impulses are sent *quickly* to protect the body from any harm.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with the passage:

* **B: Rokter probahoke niyontron kora (Control blood flow):**  Nervous system control over blood flow is a *part* of maintaining homeostasis and responding to threats.
* **C: Homostasis bojay rakha (Maintain homeostasis):** This is directly stated as the nervous system's primary function in the passage.
* **D: sombhabbo je kono dhoroner khoti thekey shorirke rokkha kora (Protect the body from any harm):**  This is also directly stated as a purpose of the fast nerve impulses.

**Slowly down blood flow** doesn't align with the idea of *fast* responses for protection. In fact, in many emergency situations, the nervous system would *increase* blood flow to certain areas, not slow it down.



"
Gija Plateau-te ki dekha jay?,"The correct answer is **D: Greet Pyramid**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: """"mishorer mritoder upottokai abosthito gija upottoka, athoba """"""""gija necropolis"""""""" ee besh kekopti pyramid (jegulor modhye greet pyramid hachche sobche boro), kekopti chhoto chhoto samadhi, kekopti mandir ebong bishal sphinx royeche."""" This means Giza Necropolis (Giza Plateau) contains many pyramids *including* the Great Pyramid, along with tombs, temples, and the Sphinx.

While tombs (samadhi) and temples (mandir) are *also* present, the passage highlights the Great Pyramid as the most significant feature. Option C is incorrect because it refers to all seven wonders of the ancient world, and the passage only discusses the pyramids of Giza.



"
Greet Pyramid-er uddeshyo ki chhilo?,"The correct answer is **B: Ekjon farao ke somoan janano** (To honor a pharaoh).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dya greet pyramid toiri koraa hoyechilo farao khufuke somoan jananor jonno."" (The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bishwer Sopto bismoyer  ekti howa** (To be one of the Seven Wonders of the World) - While it *is* a Wonder of the World, that wasn't the *purpose* of building it. It became famous *because* of its grandeur.
*   **C: Landmark hisebe kaj kora** (To work as a landmark) - While it certainly *is* a landmark, that was a consequence, not the primary reason for its construction.
*   **D: Mrito byaktider somadhi songrokkhon kora** (To protect the tombs of the dead) -  While it's part of a necropolis (city of the dead), the primary purpose of the *Great Pyramid itself* was for the Pharaoh's burial and honoring him in the afterlife.



"
Agnisanjoger  madhomye mandir binosto korar je ghotonati amra jani sei ghotonar jonyo ke dayi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ephesians**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ephesuse artemiser mandir 21 shhey julai, 356 khrishtopurbe herostratus er dwara agnisanjoger madhyome binosto koraa hoyechilo."" This directly translates to: ""The Temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed by Herostratus by fire on July 21, 356 BC.""

While Herostratus *did* the act, the question asks who is responsible for the event *of* the destruction, and the text clearly places that event in Ephesus. The other options are incorrect:

*   **Mohan alekjandar (Alexander the Great):** He offered to rebuild the temple, he didn't destroy it.
*   **Strabo:** He was a historian who *recorded* the event, he wasn't involved in it.
*   **Artemis:** She was the goddess the temple was dedicated to, not the cause of its destruction.

Nicher konti artemis-er mandir punornirman somporke ekti nirbhul bornona day?,"The correct answer is **B: Mohan alekjandar’er rajottwer pore eti punornirman kora hoy** (The temple was rebuilt after Alexander's ascension to the throne).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""aleksandar mrityur pore 323 khristopurbabde mandirtir punarnirman koraa hoyechilo"" (The temple was rebuilt in 323 BC after Alexander's death). While Alexander *offered* to fund the rebuilding, it happened *after* his death. This means it occurred after his reign.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mohan alekjandar ei punornirmaner khoroch diyechhilen** (Alexander funded this reconstruction) - The text says he *offered* to, but the offer was declined.
* **C: Herostratus ke etir khoroch bohon korar adesh dewa hoy** (Herostratus was ordered to bear the cost) - The text says Herostratus *destroyed* the temple, not that he paid for its reconstruction.
* **D: Eti 320 khristopurbabde punornirmito hoy** (It was rebuilt in 320 BC) - The text specifically states it was rebuilt in **323** BC.

"Onucchhed onujaayi, sorboprothom kokhon kono projati dui poey haantechhilo?","The correct answer is **A: Saat million bochor age** (7 million years ago).

The text states: ""...sahelantropas saat million bochor agei due'poey haanta shuru korechilo."" which translates to ""...Sahelanthropus started walking on two feet even 7 million years ago.""

Therefore, according to the passage, Sahelanthropus was the first species to walk on two feet, approximately 7 million years ago."
Kon projati niyomito dui  poey haante?,"The correct answer is **B: Hemea erectus**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...*Homo erectus* projatir manoos dui poey sampurna seja hoye dandate parol."" This directly translates to ""*Homo erectus* species of humans were the first to walk upright on two legs.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sahelantropas:** The text says *Sahelanthropus* *might* have started walking on two legs around 7 million years ago, but doesn't state they *regularly* did. It's an assumption (""anuman koraa hoy"").
*   **C: Dwipod bishishto prani:** This is a general term (""two-legged creature"") and not a specific species.
*   **D: Australopithecus:** The text specifically states *Australopithecus* didn't naturally walk upright (""swabhabikbhabe soja hoye hunter abhyas chhilo naa""). They were precursors to species that did.

WWII cholakale  german naubahini kon kajti sombhob korte cheyechhilo?,"The correct answer is **B: Britten ke lokball o ponyo paway badha dite** (To hinder Britain from receiving supplies and resources).

Here's why:

The passage states that the German navy (muloto eu-nauka byabohar korey) was trying to *thamanor chesta korchilo* (hinder/stop) the traffic of supplies from America to Britain across the Atlantic.  This directly means they were trying to prevent Britain from *getting* supplies and resources (lokball o ponyo).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Britten theke asha upokoron atkate** (To seize hope/supplies from Britain) - The passage doesn't mention Germany trying to *take* supplies *from* Britain, but preventing them from *reaching* Britain.
*   **C: Atlantic jurhe jinishpotro poribohon korte** (To transport goods across the Atlantic) - This is what the *Allies* were trying to do, not the Germans.
*   **D: Americar lokball o upokoron pawa atkate** (To seize American supplies and resources) - The Germans weren't directly targeting American ships, but trying to stop them from reaching Britain.



"
"Onucchhede prodotto totthyo onujaayi, uttor atlantik abhiyan cholakale nou juddhe k sobcheye sophol hoyechhilo?","The correct answer is **B: Germanra**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the German navy (using U-boats) was *trying to stop* the traffic of goods and supplies from America to Britain. This implies they were successful to some extent in disrupting the Allied efforts. The passage also states that if the Allied efforts had *failed* (meaning the German efforts succeeded), Germany could have conquered Britain.  Therefore, the German navy was the more successful force in the North Atlantic campaign, as they were actively hindering the Allies and posed a significant threat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: British o American:** The passage says they were *attempting* to get supplies across, but it also highlights the German efforts to *stop* them.
*   **C: German o British:** While both sides were involved, the passage points to the German efforts as being particularly effective in threatening the overall outcome.
*   **D: British:** The British were receiving aid, but the passage focuses on the German efforts to prevent that aid from arriving.



"
Asherianra ashwarohir byabohar jokhon bastobayon korechhilo tokhon konti bidyoman chhilo na?,"The correct answer is **A: Jin**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ghoar jina tokhono abishkar honey, taai assyrian ashwarohira taader ghodagulir khaali pitthe bosey juddho korechilo."" This translates to ""The stirrup hadn't been invented yet, so the Assyrian cavalry fought by simply sitting on their horses' backs.""

Therefore, the stirrup (jin) was not yet available when the Assyrians began using cavalry.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Crossbow:** The passage mentions dhanuk (bows), implying archery was used, not specifically crossbows. Even if they hadn't used crossbows, the passage doesn't state it didn't exist.
*   **C: Rath:** The passage mentions rath (chariots) were used *before* the cavalry, meaning they *did* exist.
*   **D: Bormo:** The passage says the arrows from the bows could pierce enemy armor (bormo), meaning armor existed."
Jeshob juddhe Ashwarohir lorai e byabohrito hoto seguli kibhabe hoto?,"The correct answer is **B: Bormo chharha** (뚫고 들어가다 - to pierce/penetrate).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Taader marattok dhanukguli thekey tirgulo protidwondi sainyader **bormo ved korey probesh korte parto.**""  This directly translates to ""Their deadly arrows could **pierce** the enemy soldiers.""  This refers to how the arrows from the cavalry were used in battle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Paye hente** (পায়ে হেঁটে - walking) - The passage describes *mounted* warriors (ashwarohi), so walking isn't relevant.
*   **C: Ghoda chorhe** (ঘোড়া চড়ে - riding a horse) - While they *were* riding horses, this doesn't describe *how* they fought. It just states *that* they rode.
*   **D: Kom joddha niye** (কম যোদ্ধা নিয়ে - with fewer warriors) - The passage doesn't mention the number of warriors.

Therefore, **B** is the only option that accurately describes a tactic used by the Assyrian cavalry based on the given text.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lokera debotader jonno balidan anoto ebong purohitora anusthan ebong utsobgulir madhyome debotader prayojan purone monojog dear chesta karat."" (People would bring sacrifices for the gods and try to fulfill the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals performed by priests.) This implies people would be found in the temple grounds *bringing* sacrifices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mul mandirer anusthane uposthit howa** (Attending the rituals of the main temple) - The passage says only priests entered the inner sanctuary (abhayaranya) where the rituals took place.
* **C: Mandir prangoner utsobe** (In the festival of the temple grounds) - While festivals occurred, the passage doesn't specify that *everyone* participated in them. It focuses on sacrifices being brought.
* **D: Vetore ekti abhayaranya balidan niye asha** (Coming to the inner sanctuary with sacrifices) -  The passage explicitly states *only* priests entered the inner sanctuary.

Nicher konti bisheshbhabe purohitder jonyo projojyo chhilo?,"The correct answer is **B: Obhyontorin abhayaranya** (Inner sanctuary).

Here's why:

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Utsab (Festival):** While festivals likely occurred, the passage doesn't specify they were *specifically* needed for the priests.
*   **C: Anusthan (Rituals):** Priests *performed* rituals, but the rituals weren't a *place* or a *thing* specifically for them.
*   **D: Jigurat (Ziggurat):** Ziggurats were part of the temple complex but not exclusively for the priests' use. They were the dwelling place of the gods.



"
Tutankhamun kokhon sukhyati labh korechhilen?,"The correct answer is **C: Tar somadhi abishkarer pore** (After his tomb was discovered).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""jahok, 1922 saale tar samadhir sandhan take ek bikhyato bekti baniye felechilo"" which translates to ""however, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a famous person."" This clearly indicates that Tutankhamun gained fame *after* his tomb was discovered.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tar samadhi loot howar pore** (After his tomb was looted) - The passage states his tomb was *not* looted, it was intact.
* **B: Tar rajottwer somoy** (During his reign) - The passage says he wasn't considered very important during his time.
* **D: Prachin rajader talikay ullekh korar pore** (After being mentioned in lists of ancient kings) - The passage says he wasn't included in most ancient king lists.



"
Konti Tutankhamunke jonoprio mishorio raja korechhilo?,"The correct answer is **A: Tar okkhoto samadhi abishkar** (The discovery of his intact tomb).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""1922 saale tar samadhir sandhan take ek bikhyato bekti baniye felechilo."" (The discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a famous person). This directly links the discovery of his tomb to his popularity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Prachin rajader talikay tar obosthan** (His position in the lists of ancient kings): The passage says he wasn't considered very important in ancient times and wasn't usually included in king lists.
* **C: Tar samadhi theke hajar hajar shilpokormo loot kora** (The looting of thousands of artworks from his tomb): The passage emphasizes the *intact* nature of the tomb, meaning it *wasn't* looted like others.
* **D: Mishorio somoye tar gurutto** (His importance during his reign): The passage states he wasn’t considered very important during his time.

The passage states ""kingbadanti ondho cobby, jini greek sahityer 2 ti masterpiece rachona korechilen: iliad ebong odisi kobita."" This translates to ""it is said that he was a blind poet, who wrote 2 masterpieces of Greek literature: the Iliad and the Odyssey.""

Therefore, Homer was blind.
"
Kon bikkhyato Greek sahityo chharha onyo kicchur jonyo suporichito chhilen?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagorus**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Aar ekjon bikhyato greek hollen ganitobid pithagoras, jini samakoni trivujer bahugulor modhye somporkogulor khettre tar bikhyato upopadyer jonno sabcheye beshi porichito."" This translates to ""And another famous Greek was the mathematician Pythagoras, who is most famous for his famous theorem in the field of relationships between the sides of a right triangle.""

This clearly indicates Pythagoras was renowned for something *other* than literature.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sophocles** - The passage identifies him as a popular playwright (literature).
*   **B: Homer** - The passage explicitly states he is known for the literary masterpieces *Iliad* and *Odyssey*.
*   **D: Aristophanes** - Also identified as a playwright (literature).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hibru familyr jeeboner odhikangshoi keteche **khola hawar**."" This directly translates to ""The Hibru family spent most of their lives in the **open air**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Rastay** (On the road) - While stores faced the road, the passage doesn't say the family spent most of their time *on* the road.
*   **C: Uthone** (Kitchen) - The women cooked in the kitchen, but it doesn't say the family spent *most* of their time there.
*   **D: Badite** (Garden) - The passage explicitly states there was no special importance given to gardens.



"
Hibru familyr jonyo konti khub guruttopurno chhilo na?,"The correct answer is **A: Jalobayu** (Climate).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Modhyoprachyer ushno jalbayute, baditi bishesh guruttopurno chhilo naa"" which translates to ""In the hot climate of the Middle East, there was nothing particularly important about the environment/climate."" This directly answers the question ""What was not very important for the Hebrew family?"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tader store (Their store):** The passage mentions stores, but doesn't say they weren't important.
* **C: Tader badi (Their house):** The passage mentions houses being built with stone, implying they *were* important.

Explanation:

The text clearly states: ""Kintu tar abishkar chhaao, eskimo upojatira itimadhye sekhane bosobas korchilo."" This translates to ""But before his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there.""

Therefore, the Eskimo tribes were the first inhabitants of Greenland. While Erik the Red later explored and named it, he wasn't the first to settle there."
Kon group cheyar chharha khete boste pochhondo korto?,"The correct answer is **C: Dhonee Roman Purushra** (Wealthy Roman men).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""jokhon daridra lokera ebong mahila cheyare bosey taader khabar khaan, dhonee lokera eksathe hoi hullod korey khete pochondo koren."" This translates to: ""while the poor and women preferred to sit and eat their food, the wealthy liked to recline and eat together.""

Therefore, wealthy Roman men (""dhonee Roman Purushra"") are the group that preferred to recline while eating.



"
Nicher konti prachin roman bhojer ongsho hobe na?,"The correct answer is **D: Roast turkey er platter**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ancient Romans *never* tasted turkey. It emphasizes that foods we now associate with Roman cuisine (like turkey) actually came to Europe from the Americas or Asia much later.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Daridra otithider cheyare bosey khawa (Poor guests sitting on chairs to eat):** The passage mentions this as a practice - the poor and women would sit to eat while the wealthy would recline.
*   **B: Shamuk diye toiri appetizer (Appetizer made with boar):** The passage lists boar (shamuk) as one of the exotic foods Romans enjoyed.
*   **C: Dhonee lokeder dinnerer somoy niche bosa (Wealthy people sitting low during dinner):** The passage states wealthy Romans preferred to recline while eating.

"Onucchhed onujaayi, nicher kontir dirghosthayi probhab rakhar sombhabona nei?","The correct answer is **B: Ekti khudro sanskriti (A small culture)**.

This translates to: ""It is often seen that if the culture of small tribes or populations doesn't have sufficient development and utilization, it loses its relevance in history and doesn't get accepted as a full-fledged civilization.""

This directly implies that small cultures are *less likely* to have a lasting (dirghosthayi) impact. The passage emphasizes that a civilization requires a long-lasting, widespread cultural imprint—something small, undeveloped cultures often lack.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ekti somaj (A society):** Societies are fundamental to civilizations.
*   **C: Nagar-rajyo (City-states):** The passage specifically states that city-states are predecessors to nations and therefore have a historical significance.
*   **D: Ekti sabhya sanskriti (A civilized culture):**  The passage *defines* a civilized culture as being long-lasting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ekti sabhyatamulok sanskriti** (A civilization-rooted culture) - While related to the topic, the passage doesn't say this is the precursor to nations.
*   **B: Ekti ekok sanskriti** (A unitary culture) - This describes a type of culture within a civilization, not a precursor to nations.
*   **D: Ekti khudro sanskriti** (A small culture) - The passage actually says small cultures often *lack* the qualities needed to be considered a full civilization.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Jhabdrang Ngawang Namgyel built the fortress *to commemorate a victory against* Tibetan-Mongol forces, not *to celebrate* their victory. This is a crucial difference.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: Eti Bhutane obosthito** (It is located in Bhutan) - The passage clearly states it's in Bhutan.
* **C: Ekti agnikande durger onek chinnoh dhwongso hoyechhe** (Much of the fortress was destroyed in a fire) - The passage mentions a fire in 1951 that damaged a significant part of the fortress.

* **The passage states:** ""1951 saale, ek agnikander foley drukgial jongyer koyekti dhongshabosheshi baaki chhilo, jemon jhabdrang nagaoung namgyaler chitro.""  This translates to ""In 1951, after a fire, only a few ruins remained of Drukgial Jong, such as the portrait of Jhabdrang Ngawang Namgyel.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tibbati- mongol shoktira bijoyi hoyechhilo** (The Tibetan-Mongol forces were victorious) - The passage mentions this as historical context for *why* the fort was built, not what remained after the fire.
* **C: Ei akarshaner jonopriyota akranto hoyni** (The popularity of this attraction has not diminished) - While the passage states it's a popular spot, it doesn't directly answer what specifically remained after the fire.
* **D: Jhabdrang ngawang namgyel eti sanrakkhan koren** (Jhabdrang Ngawang Namgyel protected it) - He *ordered* the fort's construction, but the passage doesn't say he protected the ruins after the fire.

Combodia somporke nicher kon bornonati sotyi noy?,"The correct answer is **B: Cambodia 1772 sale Thailand e akraman korechhilo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Thailand (specifically ""Thyra"") attacked Cambodia repeatedly and destroyed the Nam Phena in 1772. It doesn't say Cambodia attacked Thailand in 1772. Instead, it describes Thailand as the aggressor.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

*   **A: Vietnami-ra nama phena dhongso korechhilo** - The passage mentions Vietnam attacked Cambodia later in the 18th century, implying involvement in events surrounding Nam Phena.
*   **C: 18 shotoker shurute Vietnamira Cambodia akraman korechhilo** - The passage states Vietnam attacked Cambodia towards the end of the 18th century, which means it happened in the beginning of the century.
*   **D: Thyra nama phena dhwangsha korechhilo** - The passage explicitly states this: ""Thyra 18 shotoke besh koyekbar combodia akraman korey ebong 1772 saale taaraa nama phena dhongso korey."" (Thyra attacked Cambodia repeatedly and destroyed the Nam Phena in 1772)."

Athero shotoker shesher dike vietnamira combodia akraman korechilo.""  This directly translates to ""Thailand attacked Cambodia several times in the 18th century and destroyed its capital in 1772. Towards the end of the 18th century, Vietnam attacked Cambodia.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vietnamira koyekbar Cambodiate akraman korechhilo** - This is true, but incomplete. It doesn't mention Thailand's involvement.
* **C: Vietnami-ra nama phena dhongso korechhilo** - This only mentions Vietnam destroying the capital, not the initial attacks.

*   **B: Buno shosyo utpadon chorcha** - The passage says they established the fort for ""ponno utpadoner poddhotir rupayntarer jonno"" (for the purpose of deer production), which is a type of resource production.

Shimonosekir chukti ki protishtha korechhilo?,"The correct answer is **D: Taiowaner upore Japaner kortritwo** (Japanese control over Taiwan).

The passage states: ""1895 saale, prothom chean-japan juddhe (1894-1895) porajoyer pore, king sarkar shimonosekir chukti swakkhar korey, jaar dwara taiwaner sarbobhoumottoke japaner kachhe tuley deyi..."" This directly translates to: ""In 1895, after the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, through which Taiwan was ceded to Japan...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Prothom Sino-Japanese juddhe Japaner porajoy** (Japan's defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War) - The passage states Japan *won* (the treaty was signed *after* China's defeat).
*   **B: Ching rajbongsher aotay ekti prodesh hisebe Taiwan’er obosthan** (Taiwan's position as a province under the Qing dynasty) - The treaty *ended* Qing control of Taiwan.

Rasaoniker ph level kibhabe mapa hoy?,"The correct answer is **C: Rasaonike Hydrogen ayaner poriman** (The amount of Hydrogen ions in the chemical).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Porikkhito rasayanike uposthito hydrogen (ph modhye h) ayangulir poriman dwara ph storti nirdeshito hoy."" This translates to ""The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions present in the tested chemical.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Rasaonikti kotota basic ba acidic** (How basic or acidic the chemical is) - While pH *indicates* acidity or basicity, it doesn't *measure* it directly. It measures the hydrogen ion concentration, which *determines* acidity/basicity.
* **B: Rasaonike kotoguli proton royechhe** (How many protons are in the chemical) -  The passage specifically discusses *hydrogen ions* (protons that have lost electrons), not the total number of protons in the chemical.
* **D: Rasaonike kotoguli electron royechhe** (How many electrons are in the chemical) - The passage focuses on protons and their role in determining pH, not the total electron count.



"
Hydrogen ayan theke ki bichchinno hoyechhilo?,"The correct answer is **D: Electron**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Hydrogen ayanguli holo emon dhoroner proton jaader electronguloke taader thekey bichchinno koraa hoyeche (hydrogen poromanugulote ekta proton ebong ekta electron thaake)."" This translates to: ""Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been separated from them (a hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).""

Therefore, what is separated from a hydrogen ion is an **electron**.
"
Nicher kon bakyoti singher pride somporke nirbhul bornona kore na?,"The correct answer is **D: Tara ubhoy e mrityubata** (They are both deadly).

Here's why:

This means *they* (the lions) are deadly *to prey*, not that they are deadly themselves (in the sense of being dangerous to other predators or humans in general).

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **A: Tader acharan kukurer doler moto** (Their behavior is like a dog pack) - The text explicitly compares their behavior to dogs.
* **B: Purush o nareer onupat soman noy** (The male-female ratio is not equal) - The passage states ""trish jon mahila ebong shaboker samanwaye gothito hoy"" (is formed with three females and several males), indicating an unequal ratio.
* **C: Purush o naree sobai ghonisthobhabe somporkito** (Males and females are all closely related) - The passage states the females are closely related, and that the pride is a large family (implying closeness between all members).

This translates to: ""Being a large family of lions and leopards, females are usually closely connected to one another. The secretive behavior of lions is like that of a dog or a hyena, remarkably similar to the behavior of dogs (but not other big cats).""

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Tara khub e samajik** (They are very social) - The passage begins by stating Singh sabcheye samajik bidal, pride namak boro dole bus korey (Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides).
* **B: Tader acharan nekrer acharaner sathe tulona kora jay** (Their behavior can be compared to hyenas) - The passage explicitly compares their behavior to hyenas and dogs.
* **C: Purush o naree ubhoy e shikarer proti khub e bhoyonkor** (Both males and females are very fearsome towards hunting) - The passage says: ""shikarder proti era atyanta mrityubata"" (They are extremely deadly towards hunters). It doesn't specify gender, but implies both participate in hunting.



Therefore, option D is the only statement that contradicts the information provided in the passage."
Jinis sarbaraha korar somoy sathe thakar jonno kakhon ekjon songir proyojon hoi?,"The correct answer is **A: Jakhon biman poribohoner madhyome jinisguli pathano hoi (When goods are sent by air transport)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that when goods are sent by air, they often take many days to unload and clear customs, making a companion necessary to oversee the process and ensure quick delivery. The passage highlights this as a problem, especially for smaller companies and on routes without dedicated airline services.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jakhan sangosthagulir nijaswa biman porisheba byabohar kore (When companies use their own airline services)** - The passage says larger companies *have* their own airline services, implying this isn't a situation needing a companion.
*   **C: Jakhan jinisguli check lagej hisabe pathano hochchhe (When goods are sent as checked baggage)** - While the passage mentions checking baggage, it doesn't say a companion is *required* in this situation; it's a workaround for a different problem.
*   **D: Jakhon deliveryti brihottor sangosthagulir kortrik porichaalito hoy (When delivery is strictly controlled by larger companies)** - The passage doesn't mention a need for a companion when deliveries are controlled by larger companies.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, ekti jote ekti niyomito flyer airlineti nirbachon korar samay, nimnolikhitogulir modhye kontike apnar ogradhikar deoya uchit?","The correct answer is **D: Je airline sombhootob beshi kichhu subidha jog korchhe** (The airline that is likely to add more benefits).

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states that even if you frequently fly with a certain airline, you should be *aware* of other airlines that might offer better benefits through their frequent flyer programs. It emphasizes that benefits aren't automatically aligned with where you currently fly the most.  Therefore, looking for the airline that offers the *most* potential benefits (subidha) is the most logical choice.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Je airline sobcheye beshi pointguli offer kore** (The airline that offers the most points): While points are important, the passage hints at looking beyond just the points themselves to the overall *benefits*.
*   **B: Jote -r modhye je airline ti sobcheye boro** (The largest airline within the alliance): Size doesn’t necessarily equate to better benefits.
*   **C: Je airline-e aapni sobcheye beshi jatayat karen** (The airline you fly the most with): The passage specifically advises against *only* considering this.



"
"Onuchchhed ti onujayee, k ekti niyomito flyer pointguli offer korte pare?","The correct answer is **D: Ek e joter modhye onyo ekti alada airline**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""...aki jote ekti alada bimaner adhine frequent flyer pointguli aaro beshi kichhu offer korte paare seii somporke aapnar abogoto howaa uchit.""  This translates to ""...it is worth being aware that another airline within the alliance may offer more frequent flyer points.""

This directly means a different airline *within the same alliance* can offer better benefits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Onyo ekti jote onyo ekti airline** - The passage talks about airlines *within* an alliance, not a different alliance altogether.
*   **B: Ek e jote er modhye apnar sobcheye beshi bhromon kora airline** - The passage specifically suggests looking *beyond* your most traveled airline within the alliance.
*   **C: Onnyo ekti jote apnar sobcheye beshi bhromon kora airline** - Again, this refers to a different alliance, not what the passage discusses.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, Atirikto modyopaner pholey nicher kon indriyo khotigrosto hote pare?","The correct answer is **A: Shrobon (Hearing)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that excessive alcohol consumption can lead to ""liverer khoti ebong emonki ondhotto ebong mrityu porjonto hote paare"" - meaning liver damage, blindness, and even death.  While the passage doesn't *directly* mention hearing loss, **blindness (loss of vision - Drishti) is explicitly stated as a potential consequence.**  The other options (taste and smell) are not mentioned.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is **A: Shrobon**. While not explicitly stated, it's the closest logical connection within the context of severe health consequences from excessive alcohol.
"
"Onuchchheder bibriti onujayee, alcohol er khotikarok probhab konti supto upaye komate pare?","The correct answer is **C: Songjoto matray alcohol sebon (Consuming alcohol in moderation)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""nijer sothik matra janata khub joruri"" (knowing your proper amount is very important) and warns against ""Atirikto modyopaner pholey swasther sombhabbo dirghameyadi khotir modhye liverer khoti ebong emonki ondhotto baa mrityu porjonto hote paare"" (the consequences of excessive drinking can include liver damage, blindness, and even death).  Therefore, moderation is key to mitigating the harmful effects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Methanol er sathe alcohol sebon (Consuming alcohol with methanol):** The passage *warns against* this, stating it can cause blindness or death.
* **B: Aboidhobhabe utpadito alcohol sebon kora (Consuming illegally produced alcohol):** The passage explicitly states this is *more* dangerous due to the presence of harmful substances like methanol.
* **D: Bibhinno byaktir sathe sebon kora (Consuming with different people):** The passage doesn't mention anything about who you drink with, only *how much* you drink.



"
Amsterdamer kothay  sampattir mulya sob theke beshi?,"The correct answer is **A: Canal District-e**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ebong er sampattir mulya desher sorbochcho abosthane royeche"" (and the value of its property is at the highest level in the country) referring to the Canal District. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: UNESCO biswa oitijhyo sthan hisabe mononito je kono sthan:** While the Canal District *is* a UNESCO World Heritage site, the question asks about property value, not just places recognized by UNESCO.
* **C: Binnenstadke theke je sthanguli sorano hoyechhe:** This is too vague. The passage specifically focuses on the Canal District within the Binnenstad.
* **D: Oitihasik mulya royechhe emon sthan:**  Many places have historical value, but the passage specifically links the *highest property value* to the Canal District.



"
Canal District k keno UNESCO biswa oitijhyo sthan hisabe manoneeto koraa hoyeche?,"The correct answer is **A: Ekhankar oitihasik ebong saangskritik mulya** (Its historical and cultural value).

The text explicitly states that the Canal District was recognized by UNESCO ""as a world heritage site due to its unique cultural and historical value.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Etir ononnyo boishishtyo** (Its other features) - While the district has other features, the text specifically highlights historical and cultural value.
* **C: Binnenstadke ghire etir abosthan** (Its location within the city center) - Location is mentioned, but not as the *reason* for UNESCO recognition.
* **D: Etir sampattir uchcho mulya** (The high value of its properties) - High property value is a consequence of its status, not the reason for it.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, nicher konti Foam Chrome bhromon k sarthok kore tole?","The correct answer is **D: Hrodotite ekti nauka bhromon** (A boat ride in the lake).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mandirer meghachonno abhaoa ebong Tonle Sap hroder drishya pahare othake sarthok korey tole."" which translates to ""The majestic appearance of the temples and the view of Tonle Sap lake make visiting the mountain worthwhile.""  It also specifically mentions you can ""subidhajonokbhabe hrodotite ekti nauka bhromon jog koraa jete paare"" - ""conveniently take a boat ride in the lake.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tonle Sap theke uporer drishyo** (The view from Tonle Sap) - While the view *of* Tonle Sap is mentioned as making the visit worthwhile, the passage doesn't suggest viewing *from* Tonle Sap is the key activity.
*   **B: Angkor Passer modhyo diye bhromon** (Touring through Angkor Pass) - The passage mentions needing an Angkor Pass to visit the temple, but doesn’t say touring *through* it makes the visit worthwhile.
*   **C: Siem Reaper dekha** (Seeing Siem Reap) - Siem Reap is just the location; the passage focuses on the mountain and the lake.



"
"Onuchchhed ti onujayee, Foam Chrome probesher jonno dorshonarthider ki proyojan?","The correct answer is **C: Angkor Passer proyojan**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mondire dhukte gele Angkor Passer proyojan hoy taai Tonle Sap gele aapner passportta sange nite bhulben naa.""  This translates to ""To enter the temple, you need an Angkor Pass, so don't forget to take your passport with you when you go to Tonle Sap.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jashobarmaner mandirer pash diye arohon** - While the passage mentions Jashobarman's temples, it doesn't say you need to climb them to enter Foam Chrome.
*   **B: Siem Reaper charpashe bhromon** - The passage mentions Siem Reap's location, but doesn't state it's a requirement for entry.
*   **D: Tonle Sap er charpashe nauka bhromon** - While a boat trip on Tonle Sap is suggested, it's not a *requirement* to enter Foam Chrome.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, nicher konti Porjotokder Antarctica bhromon e badha dite pare?","The correct answer is **D: Seemaboddho sharirik susthotar** (Limited physical health).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Porjotokder bhromon byabahul, **sharirik susthotar darkar**..."" (Tourism is challenging, **requires physical fitness**...).  This directly implies that a lack of physical fitness can hinder tourists from visiting Antarctica.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Otyodhik bhromon budget** (Excessive tourism budget) - The passage doesn't mention cost as a barrier.
*   **B: Kebol Ros sagore ghure dekhar agroho** (Reluctance to only see the Ross Sea) - The passage doesn't suggest anyone is unwilling to only see the Ross Sea.
*   **C: Kajer somoysuchi ja December ebong Januaryte bhromoner sujog daay** (Work schedule that allows opportunities to travel in December and January) - The passage states travel is *possible* between November and February, not that schedules prevent it.



"
Ekjon porbotarohone agrohi porjotokder Antarctica r kon ongshe jete paren?,"The correct answer is **B: Inland elaka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Majhemadhye porbotarohoner jonno baa merute pouchte biseshoggo er tourguli vetorer dike yay, jekhane bishal ekti base royeche."" This translates to ""Especially for mountaineering or reaching the pole, tours often go towards the interior, where a large base is located.""  The ""interior"" refers to Inland Antarctica.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ros sagore:** The passage mentions the Ross Sea as a boundary, not a destination for mountaineering tours.
*   **C: Upodweep:** While part of Antarctica, the passage doesn't specifically say mountaineering tours go there.
*   **D: Dweeppunjo:** Similar to ""Upodweep,"" it's a region of Antarctica but not highlighted as a destination for climbers.



"
Ekti Prac-adhunik juger porjobekkhonagarguli kothay abosthito howar sombhabona sob theke kom?,"The correct answer is **A: Sahoje jaoyoa jaay emon sthane (Places easily accessible)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that modern research telescopes are *more easily accessible* than older observatories. It also says older observatories are often located in cities or campuses, making them more accessible *compared to* modern ones.  Therefore, an older observatory being located in a place that is *not* easily accessible would be the least likely scenario.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: shahargulite prankendre (In city centers):** The passage states older observatories are *often* found in cities.
* **C: Ekti prottonto anchale (A prominent area):**  The passage doesn't rule out this possibility.
* **D: Ekti college campuse (A college campus):** The passage states older observatories are *often* found on campuses.



"
Ekti adhunik gobeshonar telescopguli kothay rakhar sombhabona ache?,"The correct answer is **D: onek sujog-suvidha pradan kora sthane.** (in places that provide many facilities).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Beshirbhag adhunik gobeshonar telescopguli anukul bayumandaliya abhaowa prottonto anchale onek sujog-suvidha pradan korey."" (Most modern research telescopes provide many facilities in areas with favorable atmospheric conditions).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ekti museum e (In a museum):** The passage mentions old observatories are *now* often museums, not where new ones are built.
*   **B: Ekti biswabidyalay campuse (In a university campus):** While some telescopes are on campuses, the passage emphasizes the *atmospheric conditions* as the primary factor, not campus location.
*   **C: Ekti shikkhamulok sthane (In an educational institution):** Similar to B, it's not the defining characteristic.

Option D directly reflects the information provided in the passage about the ideal location for modern research telescopes – places with good facilities.



"
"Onuchchhed ti onujayee, ekti shanto samudra saikat diner jonno kon elakati sera hobe?","The correct answer is **C: uttor potashray jelate** (North Shore beaches).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that the North Shore beaches (Northcote to Long Bay) are located in the calmer waters of the Hauraki Gulf and are ""proshanto mahasagare abosthito"" (situated in a peaceful ocean). It also mentions they are good for safe swimming and have shade from Pohutukawa trees.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Sent Heelers:** While mentioned as part of Central Auckland, the passage describes it as ""majhemajhe ghonosonnibishto"" (sometimes crowded).
*   **B: Mission Bay:** Similar to Sent Heelers, it's also described as potentially crowded.
*   **D: Waitemata bandar:** This is the name of the harbor, not a beach itself.

Therefore, the North Shore beaches are the best choice for a peaceful ocean beach day based on the provided text."
"Onuchchhed ti onujayee, kothay saantaar kaata sob cheye nirapad  hote pare?","The correct answer is **C: Central Ocklander**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""saantaar kaata nirapad"" (swimming is safe) in the context of Central Ocklander, specifically mentioning Sent Heelers and Mission Bay. While other areas are mentioned as having beaches, Central Ocklander is the only one directly described as having safe swimming conditions.



"
"Onuchchhede bornito sthan poridarshan er somoy, nicher konti onupojukto bole bibechito hobe?","The correct answer is **C: Moja kora**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states ""Holocaust baa Natsider niye moja korben naa"" which translates to ""Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.""  This makes joking entirely inappropriate and disrespectful at such a site.

Let's look at why the other options are *not* inappropriate:

*   **A: Gambhirjopurno aachoron (Serious behavior):** The context demands serious and respectful behavior.
*   **B: Sthantir charpasher kono jaaygay chinho rekhe jaoya (Leaving a mark anywhere around the site):** The passage specifically asks for respect and to not damage the site, which includes not leaving graffiti or anything that would detract from its beauty.
*   **D: Kono chhobi aaka (Drawing any pictures):** While potentially needing consideration depending on the rules of the specific site, it isn't explicitly forbidden in the passage and isn't inherently disrespectful like joking.



"
Er modhye konti Lingua Francus bhasha k bornona kore?,"The correct answer is **C: Nirmito**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sahayak bhasha **kritrim baa nirmito** bhasha jaa manusher modhye jogajog sahaj korar uddeshye toiri koraa hoyeche..."" (Auxiliary languages are **artificial or constructed** languages created to facilitate communication among people...)
* **Lingua Franca** are described as being *different* from these *kritrim/nirmito* languages.  The passage explicitly uses ""nirmito"" to describe the type of language auxiliary languages are.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kritrim:** While ""kritrim"" (artificial) is used, ""nirmito"" (constructed) is also used to define these languages alongside it. The passage focuses on the distinction *between* these and Lingua Franca.
* **B: Oprakrito (Unnatural):** This isn't a term used in the passage.
* **D: Joibo (I don't know):** This is not related to the passage.



Therefore, **Nirmito (constructed)** is the best answer as it directly describes the type of language the passage is discussing as being different from a Lingua Franca."
Kon bibrititiSahayak bhashake sothibhabe bornona kore na?,"The correct answer is **B: Eguli emon bhasha ja ekisathe prakritik ebong nirmito** (These are languages that are both natural and constructed).

Here's why:

* **The passage clearly states that auxiliary languages are *constructed* (or artificial) languages.** They are *made* to facilitate communication. They are *not* naturally evolved languages.  The passage specifically contrasts them with ""Lingua Francas"" which *are* often naturally occurring languages that become widely used.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eguli emon joibo bhasha ja emon lokeder modhye jogajoger subidarthe byabohrito hoi jara echharha eke aporke bujhte pare na** (These are languages used to facilitate communication among people who otherwise cannot understand each other) - This aligns with the passage's description.
* **C: Eguli holo kothin jogajoger poristhiti mokabela korar jonno nirmito bhasha** (These are constructed languages to make difficult communication situations easier) -  This is a good summary of the purpose of auxiliary languages, as described in the passage.
* **D: Eguli holo bibhinno bhashar boktader modhye gorhe otha provabshalee bhasha** (These are influential languages among speakers of different languages) - While auxiliary languages *can* become influential, this describes a *Lingua Franca* more accurately than an auxiliary language itself.  The passage differentiates between the two.



Therefore, option B is the only one that misrepresents what the passage says about auxiliary languages."
"Onuchchhed onujayee, ekjon jatrir somudro bhromon jodi shitkale hoi tobe tar ki ki porikkha kora uchit?","The correct answer is **A: Cabin er obosthan (The condition of the cabin)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Jodi shitkale uttor Baltic atikram koraa hoy, tobe **kebiner abosthanti porikkha korey dekhun**, kaaron barafer modhyo die jawar somoy sobtheke khotigrostho kebingulo thekey bhayabaha shobdo hoy."" (If crossing the northern Baltic in winter, **check the condition of the cabins**, because during ice breaking, the most vulnerable cabins make frightening noises.)

The question asks what a traveler should check if traveling by sea in winter. The passage directly links winter sea travel to checking the cabin condition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Visar aaboshyikotaguli (Visar requirements)** - The passage mentions ""Kruj jatrider visar prayojaniyata thekey chhaar deoa hoyeche"" (Visar requirements for Kruj travelers have been waived), but doesn't relate this to general winter sea travel checks.
*   **C: Shortadi (Short forms)** - The passage simply mentions using short forms for the exam and isn't a check a traveler needs to perform.
*   **D: shahare kathano somoyer poriman (The amount of time stated in the city)** - Saint Pietersberg and Kruj are mentioned for time zone context, but not relevant to traveler checks.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, jodi ekjon jatrider somudro bhromon greeshmokale hoy, tobe tara ki ki erate parbe?","The correct answer is **B: Barafer modhyo diye jaoya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""kaaron barafer modhyo die jawar somoy sobtheke khotigrostho kebingulo thekey bhayabaha shobdo hoy"" (because the time to travel through the ice is the most dangerous from the most vulnerable cabins). This implies traveling *through the ice* is something a traveler might encounter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: shahare katano somoy (spending time in the city)** - The passage mentions cities (Saint Pietersberg, Kruj) but doesn’t suggest travelers *will* spend time there. Kruj's visitor requirements are being *removed*.
*   **C: Visar aaboshyikotaguli (visa requirements)** - The passage specifically states visa requirements are being *waived* (""chhaar deoa hoyeche"").
*   **D: Saint Pietersberg** - Simply mentioning the city doesn't mean a traveler will experience it.



Therefore, the only event directly linked to a summer sea voyage according to the passage is the dangerous journey through the ice (""barafer modhyo diye jaoya"")."
Barcelonar te sign ebong ghoshana r jonno keno niyomitobhabe Katalan byabohrito hoy?,"The correct answer is **B: Eti shaharer prothom daptorik bhasha** (It is the city's first official language).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jodio odhikangsho chinno shudhumatra Katalane nirdesh korey kaaron eti aain er madhyome prothom daptorik bhasha hisabe protisthito hoy."" This directly translates to ""Although most people simply indicate Catalan because it is established as the first official language by law.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Spenish er theke eti aro beshi lok bojhe** (More people understand it than Spanish) - The passage says a majority *understand* Catalan, but it doesn't say more people understand it than Spanish. It states almost everyone *knows* Spanish.
*   **C: Eti Barcelonar te sob theke pochhonder bhasha** (It is the most widespread language in Barcelona) - The passage doesn't claim it's the *most* widespread, just that a significant portion speaks it.
*   **D: Metro ebong onnyanyo sthaniyo elakay Katalan bhashi nagorikder songkhyie beshi** (There is a larger number of Catalan-speaking citizens in the metro and other local areas) - The passage doesn't give information about the number of Catalan speakers in specific areas.

Therefore, the primary reason for the regular use of Catalan in signs and announcements is its status as the first official language."
Barcelonar metro system niyomito ghoshana r jonno nicher kon bhasha byabohar kore?,"The correct answer is **B: Katalan**.

The passage states: ""Metro નિયમિતો Katalan bhasa ghoshana koraa hoy..."" which translates to ""The metro regularly makes announcements in the Catalan language...""

While other languages are *also* used through an automated system, Katalan is the language for the regular announcements.

It highlights things like hand-made or antique bedding, local seasonal food, antique furniture, small thatched roofs, and a swimming pool within a historical building. 

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: bishesh khabar er itemer (Special food items):** The passage *explicitly* mentions ""anchaltir ritugato akarshan baa amantrayir bishesh khabar"" (local seasonal attractions or special inviting food), making this a likely feature.
* **B: Ononnyo prachin grihosojja er asbab (Other antique furniture):** The passage specifically mentions ""prachin grihosojja, prachin asbab"" (antique furnishings, antique furniture), so this is also a likely feature.
* **C: Barir baiere bhalobhabe shojjito sthaan (Well-decorated outdoor space):** While a swimming pool is mentioned, there's nothing about extensive or elaborate outdoor decoration.  The focus is on the historical building itself and its features.
* **D: Drutogotir WiFi (Fast WiFi):** The passage focuses entirely on the *experience* – historical ambiance, local food, comfortable bedding. Modern amenities like fast WiFi are *not* mentioned and would be out of place with the described setting.

Therefore, the answer is **D: Drutogotir WiFi**. It's the only option not implied or directly mentioned in the passage.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, nicher konti bilasbohul B and BS er modhye protijogitar pradhan pointgulir ekti noi?","The correct answer is **A: Somosamoyik sajsojja (Contemporary decoration)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the competition between B and BS revolves around:

*   **Bichhana pottor (Bed linen/Bedding)** - This is represented by option C: bilash-bahul bichhana (luxurious bedding).
*   **Sakaler khabar (Breakfast)** - This is represented by option D: Sthaniyo bhabe prapto khadyo ebong paaniyo (Locally sourced food and drink) and option B: Morshumi pratorasher bibhinno poribeshona (Different seasonal breakfast offerings).

The passage emphasizes a focus on *traditional* or *historical* elements like antique furniture, thatched roofs, and historical buildings.  **Contemporary decoration (Somosamoyik sajsojja)** doesn't fit this theme. It suggests modern styling, which isn't highlighted as a point of competition.

Therefore, contemporary decoration is not a primary point of competition between B and BS according to the passage."
"Onuchchhed ti onujayee, 2022 saale Beijing a nicher konti onushthito hobe na?","The correct answer is **B: Taijicheng sky elaka eranusthan**.

Here's why:

The passage states that skiing events will be *held* at the Taijicheng sky area, but it doesn't say there will be an *opening ceremony* there. It specifically mentions the opening and closing ceremonies will be in Beijing itself. The passage *does* mention the opening ceremony (udwodhoni anusthan), closing ceremony (samapti anusthan), and ice sports (andar baraf kridasuchir) will be in Beijing.

Therefore, the Taijicheng sky area is a venue for events, not a location for a ceremony."
"Onuchchhed onujayee, nicher konti 2022 saale Beijing a anusthan hobe?","The correct answer is **C: Shitkalin olympic**.

Here's why:

The passage clearly states ""Cheener beijing shohor 2022 saaler **shitkalin olympic gamer** ayojok shohor hobey"" (Beijing city will be the host city for the 2022 **Winter Olympics**).  It also mentions events *within* the Winter Olympics like ""andar baraf kridasuchir"" (ice sports) and skiing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Greeshmokalin Olympics (Summer Olympics)** - The passage specifically mentions the *Winter* Olympics.
*   **B: andar baraf kridasuchir (ice sports)** - This is *part* of the Winter Olympics, not the overall event.
*   **D: Samapti anusthan (closing ceremony)** - This is an event *within* the Olympics, not the Olympics themselves.



"
Kader Avian Influenja howar jhunki sob cheye beshi?,"The correct answer is **C: hans-murgi niye kaaj korey emon lokder** (people who work with ducks and chickens).

Here's why:

The passage states ""Beshirbhagi hans-murgi niye kaaj korey emon lokder saathe jorito chhilo"" which translates to ""Most cases were associated with people who work with ducks and chickens.""  This directly indicates they have the highest risk.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: pakhi porjobekkhokdero** (bird watchers) - The passage mentions some risk for bird watchers, but it's described as ""kichhu jhunkio"" (some risk), not the highest.
*   **B: Jara stannyapayi niye kaaj kore** (those who work with mammals) - The passage states the flu can infect both birds *and* mammals, but doesn't say this group has the highest risk.
*   **D: Jara aage sangkramito hoyechhilo** (those who were previously infected) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage says it's *primarily* linked to people working with poultry, not *only* them.
* **B:** The passage states the opposite – infections in humans are relatively rare compared to birds.
* **C:** While bird handlers have had some cases, the passage doesn't suggest this is the most defining characteristic of bird flu.

Shweto sagarer-Baltic khaal ki jukto kore?,"The correct answer is **C: Sumeru mahasagarke Baltic sagarer saathe**.

This directly translates to ""The White Sea-Baltic canal connects the Arctic Ocean to the Baltic Sea via Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and through Saint Petersburg, mostly through rivers and lakes.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Krishna sagar ebong Caspian sagare** - The text mentions these seas in relation to Viking routes, but not as being connected by the White Sea-Baltic canal.
*   **B: Onega lake ebong Volga nodee** - While Onega Lake *is* part of the route, it doesn't define what the canal connects. Volga is mentioned as being connected to Onega, but not the ultimate connection point.
*   **D: Dakkhin Mohasagar and Red sagar** - These seas are not mentioned in the text at all.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, Kon dharoner janbahone passport sanggroho kora jete pare ja jatrir jonno osubidha srishti kore na?","The correct answer is **B: Rater sleeper traine**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Rater sleeper traine conductorra aapnar passport sangraha korey rakhte paare jaate aapner ghumer byaghat naa hoy."" (Night sleeper train conductors may collect your passport to avoid disrupting your sleep). This specifically mentions passport collection *to avoid inconvenience* to the traveler.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Biman (Airplane):** The passage mentions immigration checkpoints after flights, implying you need your ID *with* you, not collected.
*   **C: Jahaj (Ship):** Similar to airplanes, the passage mentions needing your ID after disembarking.
*   **D: Cross-border traine (Cross-border trains):** The passage states you need a valid ID *with* you on these trains.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, kichu cross-border traine kakhon apnar ID porikkha kora hote pare?","The correct answer is **D: Cholonto abosthay** (While in motion).

The passage states: ""Kichhu cross-border traine cholonto abosthay anusandhan koraa hoy ebong seii traingulir ektite chharar somoy aapnar saathe boidho ID thaka uchit."" This directly translates to: ""Some cross-border trains conduct research while in motion and you should have valid ID with you when getting off those trains.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Train theke namar pore** (After getting off the train) - While ID is needed *when getting off* these trains, the *checking* happens while the train is moving.
*   **B: Aapni ghumanor somoy** (During your travels) -  This is too general. The passage specifies checking on cross-border trains.
*   **C: Eti porikkha kora hoi na** (This is not checked) - The passage clearly states that ID is checked on some cross-border trains.



"
Singapur er Uchcho krantiya anchale thakar somoy nicher kon somosyati dekha deoyar sobcheye beshi sombhabona achhe?,"The correct answer is **C: Taap jonito klantite bhoga (Suffering from heat)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that to be in the ""Uchcho krantiya"" area (close to the equator), you have to face ""tap (sabsomoy)"" which means heat (all the time). This directly indicates the highest probability of experiencing discomfort due to heat.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Chhintai howar (Being worried):** While being in a challenging location might cause some worry, the passage doesn't highlight this as a primary concern.
*   **B: Sahoje kono dokan paoya (Easily finding shops):** The passage states that after reaching Singapore, you can easily buy anything, suggesting shopping isn't a problem.
*   **D: Hariye jaoya (Getting lost):** The passage focuses on the climate challenges, not the risk of getting lost.



"
K German pastryguli khaoya eriye jete pare?,"The correct answer is **D: Masladar swader cheye mishti swad pochhondo koren emon byakti (People who prefer sweet taste over savory taste)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly describes German pastries as sweet, mentioning ingredients like apples, cherries, plums, almonds, hazelnuts, and being well-suited with coffee. This clearly indicates they cater to a preference for sweet flavors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Badame gurutoro allergy achhe emon byakti (People with a severe almond allergy):** The passage *mentions* almonds and hazelnuts are common ingredients, making it unsuitable for someone with those allergies.
*   **B: Bhari dessert pochhondo koren emon byakti (People who like heavy desserts):** While some German pastries might be heavy, the passage doesn't specifically emphasize that. It focuses on the *flavor* profile.
*   **C: Chocolate opochhondo koren emon byakti (People who dislike chocolate):** The passage doesn't mention chocolate at all, so this preference isn't relevant.



"
Kon upadank German pastryguli morshumi upadan hisabe bibechona kora hoy?,"The correct answer is **B: Hazelnut**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Germanyr onek beck koraa khabargulite badam, **Hajnelot** ebong anyanno badamer Upadan paoa jaay."" (In many of Germany's baked goods, almonds, **hazelnuts**, and other nut ingredients are found.)

While apples, plums, and almonds are mentioned as ingredients in German pastries, hazelnuts are specifically highlighted as a common ingredient in *baked* goods, making it the most appropriate answer to the question about a ""morshumi upadan"" (seasonal ingredient - though in this context it means a commonly used ingredient).



"
"Onuchchheder bhittite, bajete bhromon er jonno nicher kon poramorshoti deoya hobe na?","The correct answer is **C: Loker kachhe taka chaoya (Begging)**.

The passage explicitly states that travelers should not ""bhikkha korey"" which means ""beg.""  The passage outlines ethical considerations for budget travel, and begging is presented as an unacceptable practice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Apnar bhromoner somoy odbhut kaaj khoja (Finding amazing things to do during your travels)** - This is a positive aspect of travel and not mentioned as something to avoid.
*   **B: Apnar aramer maatrar proti nomoniyo howa (Being flexible with your comfort level)** - The passage suggests sacrificing comfort (""aaram"") to save money, which aligns with this.
*   **D: Khabar ebong thakar jonno kharach komano (Reducing expenses for food and accommodation)** - The passage encourages minimizing expenses (""byay seemaboddho korar chesta koro"") and keeping costs low.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, khub kom budgete bhromon kora kar jonno kothin hote pare?","The correct answer is **C: Emon keu jini beranor samay duroborti sthane theke kaaj korar porikolpona korchhen** (Someone who considers working remotely from distant locations while traveling).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that one way to travel on a small budget is to ""work during travel"" (ଭ୍ରୋମଣେର ସମୟ କାଜ କରୋ - *bhromoner somoy kaaj koro*).  This directly implies considering remote work as a means to fund travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Emon keu jini challengek swagoto janan** (Someone who welcomes challenges) - While a positive attitude helps, it doesn't directly address the *how* of budget travel.
* **B: Emon keu jar somoy kothorbhabe seemaboddho noy** (Someone whose time isn't strictly limited) -  Having flexible time is helpful, but the passage focuses on financial constraints.
* **D: Emon keu jini bhromonsuchi onusoron kora upobhog koren** (Someone who enjoys following a travel itinerary) -  This doesn't relate to the *financial* aspect of budget travel.



"
Nicher kon bibriti ti Point Marion ebong Fairmont er modhyokar drivek sothikbhabe bornona kore na?,"The correct answer is **D: Cellphone porisheba niye somosya hoy na** (There are no problems with cellphone service).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that cellphone service is *better* in the area between Point Marion and Fairmont, specifically mentioning the strength of signals like Pennsylvania Wild, compared to other areas. This directly contradicts option D.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with the passage:

*   **A: Duroborti sthaner rastaguli onek dur porjonto prosarito** (The roads in remote areas extend for long distances) - The description of a challenging drive through hilly areas suggests remote stretches of road.
*   **B: Laneguli khub e simito** (The lanes are very narrow) - The mention of sharp curves and steep banks implies narrow lanes.
*   **C: Goti seema khub komi mana hoy** (Speed limits are poorly enforced) - The passage highlights the importance of adhering to speed limits (35-40 mph) despite the challenging conditions, implicitly suggesting they might not be strictly enforced.



"
"Onuchchhed ti onujayee, nicher konti Buffalo-Pittsburgh haiwete bhromon kari chalok der prodhan udweg hobe?","The correct answer is **C: Khub druto teekhno baank neyoa (Taking very sharp turns at high speed)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically highlights the challenging driving conditions on Point Merrion and Fairmont, mentioning ""teebro bank pradhanno paay"" (steeply banked curves) and the importance of adhering to the speed limits (35-40 MPH) due to these curves. It emphasizes that these curves are the most challenging aspect of driving this route.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to be the *primary* concern:

*   **A: Bhari traffic er modhye atke jaoya (Getting stuck in heavy traffic):** While traffic could be a problem, the passage focuses on the inherent difficulty of the *road itself*.
*   **B: Porjapto cellular porishebar ghatti (Loss of adequate cellular coverage):** The passage mentions *stronger* cellular signals in this area, not a loss of coverage.
*   **D: Ghono ghono rastar kajer sommukhin hoya (Facing road work on a dense road):** While possible, the passage doesn’t mention road work specifically; it focuses on the natural challenges of the road’s design.



"
 Canyoniring shuru korar jonno nicher kontir proyojon nei?,"The passage states that canyoning requires *relatively less* training or physical fitness compared to rock climbing, scuba diving, or Alpine skiing. It mentions swimming, ascending, and jumping are involved.

Therefore, the answer is **B: Churhanto sharirik gathon** (Significant physical fitness).

Here's why:

* **A: Saantaar katar khomota (Ability to swim)** - The passage explicitly states swimming is involved.
* **C: Lafanor khomota (Ability to jump)** - The passage explicitly states jumping is involved.
* **D: Swolpo porimaner proshikkhon (Some amount of training)** - The passage states it requires *relatively less* training, meaning some training *is* needed.

The key phrase is ""tulonamulok bhabe kom proshikkhon baa sharirik gathon proyojan"" (relatively less training or physical fitness needed). This implies significant physical fitness isn't a primary requirement like it would be for other adventure sports.



"
Ekti sofol Canyoniring bhromoner jonno nicher konti proyojoniyo hote pare?,"The correct answer is **D: Saantaar katar khomota (Ability to swim)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Canyoning involves swimming, climbing, and rappelling.  Therefore, being able to swim is a fundamental requirement.
* **The passage also mentions:** Canyoning requires *relatively* less training/physical fitness compared to rock climbing, scuba diving, or alpine skiing. This implies it doesn't necessarily need high athletic ability (A) or prior experience in other adventure sports (B).
* **Canyoniring e sonod laabh (C) - Having a liking for canyoning** is a preference, not a requirement for a *successful* trip.

Therefore, the most essential thing for a successful canyoning trip, based on the passage, is the ability to swim."
"Onuchchhed onujayee, keu tar gaari te camp korar porikolpona korle taar jonno konti sohayok hobe?","The correct answer is **B: Asonguli shoyano jay emon gaari**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Jodi shoano jaay emon aasonsoho ekti boro minivan, SUV, Sedan baa station wagon thaake tahole aapner jonno gaari camping sombhob."" (If you happen to have a large minivan, SUV, Sedan or station wagon, then car camping is possible for you.) This means having a vehicle that allows for sleeping inside is crucial for car camping.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Apnar garir simabaddhataguli somporke susposhto dharona thaaka (Having a clear understanding of your car's limitations):** While important for general road trips, it's not *specifically* helpful for *car camping*. It's a prerequisite for any driving, not unique to camping.
*   **C: Ekti tanbu (A tent):** The passage implies car camping *avoids* the need for a tent (""...eti modhye 'camp' korar kono upay nei bollei chole"" - ...there is no way to 'camp' inside it, it seems).
*   **D: Camp korar jonno ekti byaktigoto sompotti (Personal property for camping):** While camping gear is necessary for camping *generally*, the passage focuses on the vehicle being the shelter, making this less directly helpful.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, gaari camping kora byakti jodi radarer niche thakte chay tahole tara ki erate chaibe?","The correct answer is **A: SUV othoba minivan er moto kono boro gaari chalano**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Aapnar jodi shoano jaay emon aasonsoho ekti boro minivan, SUV, Sedan baa station wagon thaake tahole aapner jonno gaari camping sombhob."" (If you happen to have a large minivan, SUV, Sedan or station wagon, then car camping is possible for you.)

The question asks what someone wanting to ""radarer niche thakte chay"" (stay under the radar - implying discreet camping) would *need*. The passage links car camping specifically to having a larger vehicle like an SUV or minivan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Lomaba road tripe jaoya (Going on a long road trip)** - While road trips are mentioned, the passage isn't saying a long trip is *required* for car camping.
*   **C: Shahare othoba kono byaktigoto sompottite tanbu khaatano (Pitching a tent in a city or on private property)** - The passage specifically mentions avoiding pitching tents in cities or on private property.
*   **D: Tara je gaari ti byabohar korchhen seti somporke jaanar ghatti (Knowing about the car they are using)** - Knowing about the car is good, but the passage emphasizes the *type* of car needed – a larger one – not just knowing about it.



"
"Onuchchhed oujaayee, k Casablanca dwityio barer moto punoray nirman koren?","The correct answer is **D: Morokkar sultan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Morokkar sultan ei shaharti Dar el Beïda naame punarnirman korechilen..."" which translates to ""The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name Dar el Beïda..."". 

While the Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, the *second* reconstruction, giving it a new name, was done by the Moroccan sultan.



"
Ekti prakritik durjoger pore kaara adhunik shohor Casablanca porityag korechhilo?,"The correct answer is **B: Portugijra**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""1755 saale bhumikamper pore batil korar jonno Portugijra eti dhongso korey ebong Casa Branca naame punarnirman korechilo.""  This translates to: ""After the earthquake of 1755, the Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca.""

Therefore, the Portuguese abandoned (destroyed and rebuilt) Casablanca after a natural disaster (earthquake)."
"Onuchchhed onujayee, Sintrar kibhabe bideshider kaachh thekey sweekriti orjon kore?","The correct answer is **C: Lord Byroner itibachok porjalochona** (Lord Byron's prestigious discussion).

Here's why:

The passage states that Sintra became famous among foreigners ""dwara bideshider kachhe eti prosiddho korechilo"" *through* Lord Byron's vivid descriptions.  It specifically mentions his ""bibriti"" (writings/discussions) as the reason for its fame.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cabo da Rocate** - This is a destination *within* Sintra, not the reason for its acceptance by foreigners.
*   **B: Marian apochchhayar** -  Our Lady of Fatima is a significant religious site, but the passage doesn't say it's *why* Sintra gained foreign recognition.
*   **D: Eti ekti romantic itihas** - While Sintra *is* romantic, the passage focuses on *how* it became known, not its inherent romantic nature.



"

Here's why:

The passage states Armenia ""anusthanikbhabe swikriti daayni"" (formally recognized) the ""Nagrono-Karabakh anchalti"" (Nagorno-Karabakh region). The question asks what Armenia formally recognized.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Azerisder biruddhe juddhok** (War against Azerbaijanis) - The passage mentions war, but Armenia recognized the *region*, not the war itself.
* **C: Ajerbaijaner kutnoitik juktik** (Azerbaijan's diplomatic efforts) - Armenia didn't recognize Azerbaijan's diplomacy.
* **D: Notun projatontro** (New project) - Armenia recognized the region, not a project.



"
Ajerbaijaner ebong Armenian der modhyokar somporkok k probhabito korte shuru kore?,"The correct answer is **C: Kutnaitik motoved (Diplomatic negotiations)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ei anchalti niye kutnaitik motoved Armenia ebong Ajerbaijaner modhye abyahoto royechhe."" (Diplomatic negotiations have been ongoing between Armenia and Azerbaijan regarding this region.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ajerbaijaner bosobas kora Armenian ra (Armenian population settled by Azerbaijan):** This describes a *cause* of the conflict, not a way the relationship began to improve.
*   **B: 1994 saale juddho (1994 war):** This marks the *start* of a period of conflict, not a move towards improvement.
*   **D: Nagrono-Karabakh anchale (Nagorno-Karabakh region):** This is the *location* of the conflict, not a change in the relationship itself.

"Charlote taxi neoyar somoy, kontir jonno atirikto charge neoya hote pare?","The correct answer is **B: Tinjon jatri thaka (Having three passengers)**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""2 joner beshi jatri bohoner khettre ekti adhibhar royechhe"" which translates to ""There is a surcharge for more than 2 passengers."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Onnyo ekti elakay thaaka (Living in another area):** The text mentions people travel *to* Charlotte from other areas, but doesn't say there's a charge for *being* from another area.
*   **C: Uptown a jaoya (Going to Uptown):** Uptown Charlotte is discussed as a destination with many family-friendly options, but no extra charge is mentioned for going there.
*   **D: Poribar-bandhob howa (Being family-friendly):** This is a characteristic of Charlotte, not a reason for an extra charge.



"
"Onuchchhed ti onujayee, Kontir jonno Charlote sisuder niye bosobas korak netibachok dik bole bibechona kora jete pare?","The correct answer is **A: Barir mulyo (House prices/Cost of living)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Charlotte, North Carolina's ""shaktishali bishay holo etite paribargulir jonno prochur uchcho maaner bikalpa royechhe"" - a strong point is the abundance of high-quality options for families. This directly relates to the cost and availability of housing.  While the passage mentions other things, the *reason* Charlotte is attractive to families is the good options available *to* families, which is heavily influenced by housing costs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Taxi neoya (Taxi availability):** The passage mentions taxis are *not* commonly used by resident families, and only helpful in specific situations. It doesn't suggest it's a positive factor for families considering moving there.
* **C: Onnyanyo elakar basinda (Residents of other areas):** The passage says people move *to* Charlotte for family-friendliness, not that the existing residents are a draw.
* **D: Shohorti upobhog korar chesta kora (Trying to enjoy city life):** While the passage mentions easy access to city amenities, it's presented as a benefit *of* living in Charlotte, not the primary reason families choose it.



"
Spenioder abirbhaber aage Chile-r uttor dikti kara niyontron korto?,"The correct answer is **D: Inka ra**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""16 shotoke Spenioder abirbhaber aage uttor Chile Inka samrajyer adhine chhilo..."" This directly translates to ""Before the 16th century Spanish arrival, northern Chile was under the Inka Empire.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mapuche:** The Mapuche conquered central and southern Chile *after* the Inka rule in the north.
*   **B: American ra:** This is too broad and doesn't specify a controlling group.
*   **C: Arakenikanra ra:**  The passage mentions Arakenikanra (Mapuche) *conquering* territory, not controlling northern Chile *before* Spanish arrival.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, nicher konti 1810 saale ghoteni?","The correct answer is **B: Chile Spenioder biruddhe joylabh kore**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Chile declared independence in 1810 *during* the Napoleonic Wars and while temporarily free from Spanish central control, but *complete victory over Spain wasn't achieved until 1818*.  Therefore, Chile did **not** win a victory against Spain in 1810.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Kendriyo sarkarer onuposthiti chhilo** (There was an absence of central government): The passage says the independence declaration happened while Spain's central government was weakened by the Napoleonic Wars (""...ja nepolioner juddher majhkhane Spen key kichhu bochor karjokori kendriyo sarkar thekey biroto rakhe"").
*   **C: Napoleon er juddho cholchhilo** (Napoleon's war was going on): The passage explicitly states the declaration happened ""during"" the Napoleonic Wars.
*   **D: Chileer swadhinotar ghoshona kore** (Chile declared independence):  The passage directly states ""1810 saale Chile swadhinota ghoshana korey"" (In 1810 Chile declared independence).



"
Kivabe manush Liguria anchale protyonto graame pouchhate pare?,"The correct answer is **B: Gaari othoba trainer madhyome** (By car or train).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""rasta, train ebong jalopath gramer sange sangjog rokkha kore"" which translates to ""roads, trains and waterways connect the villages."" It also specifically mentions that cars *cannot* reach the villages directly (""baire thekey kono gaari sekhane pouchote paare naa"") but implies they can get *to* the area, and then use other means. Therefore, reaching the area by car and then likely taking a train (or potentially a boat/waterway) is a valid option.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gaari othoba noukar madhyome** (By car or boat) - While boats are mentioned as a waterway, the passage doesn't emphasize them as the primary transport *to* the villages.
*   **C: Train othoba noukar madhyome** (By train or boat) -  Cars are a viable option for getting *to* the area, so this isn't comprehensive.
*   **D: Biman athoba trainer madhyome** (By plane or train) - Planes are not mentioned, and while trains are mentioned, it doesn't mention planes.



"
Italian shobdo ‘Sink Terry’ er ortho ki?,"The correct answer is **A: Paanchti gram**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Sink Terry ortho holo panchabhumi, jaa Italir Liguria anchale abosthito chhoto chhoto panchti upokuliyo gram..."" This translates to ""Sink Terry means five villages, which are small coastal villages located in the Liguria region of Italy..."". Therefore, ""Sink Terry"" refers to the five villages themselves – the ""paanchti gram"" (five villages).
"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, Shitkale somvabyo picchil abosthar jonno kon dhoroner boot upojukto?","The correct answer is **D: Ekti 1/5 inch gobhir pattern chhara boot** (A boot with a 1/5 inch deep pattern).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Patternti 5 Milimeter. (1/5 inch) baa beshi er moto jotheshto govir ebong..."" - meaning a sufficient depth of the pattern should be 5 millimeters (1/5 inch) or more. This is crucial for grip on slippery surfaces.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Soru heel jukto boot (Boots with a straight heel):**  The passage doesn't mention straight heels as being helpful for preventing slips. In fact, heels generally *increase* the risk of falling.
* **B: Jorhano soronjam soho boot (Boots with attached equipment):** While the passage *mentions* studs or spikes as helpful, it doesn't present this as the primary recommendation for *all* winter boots. It's an addition, not a base requirement.
* **C: Unchu heel jukto boot (Boots with a high heel):**  High heels are specifically problematic in slippery conditions, as stated in the passage, noting that small, warm-weather shoes are often too slippery on ice.



"
Er modhye konti Shitkale  barafer rastar upor traction unnoto korte sahajyo korbe na?,"The correct answer is **D: Joll**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""gharshan tikiye rakhte, baa valo korte, rasta **baali**, **nuri** baa **noon** (Calcium chloride) prayi chharano hoy."" This means baali (sand), nuri pathar (salt), and noon (Calcium chloride) are *used to improve* traction on icy roads.

""Joll"" (জোল) is not mentioned in the passage as a substance used for improving traction. Therefore, it won't help."
Nicher konti Hawaiier ebong Cook dweeppunjer modhye ekdom sothik mil?,"The correct answer is **C: Ubhoyere ekoi time zone** (Both have the same time zone).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dweeppunjoguli Hawaiier timejone thakleo..."" which means the Cook Islands are in the same time zone as Hawaii.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ubhoyere onekguli boro boro hotel royechhe** (Both have many large hotels) - The passage specifically says Hawaii *used to be* like the Cook Islands, without large hotels, before becoming a state.
* **B: Ubhoyere kono rashtriyota nei** (Both have no nationality) - This isn't mentioned in the text and is factually incorrect; both Hawaii and the Cook Islands have a national identity (Hawaii as a US state, Cook Islands as a self-governing nation in free association with New Zealand).
* **D: Ubhoyere kono sahor nei** (Both have no cities) - The passage explicitly states Cook Islands has no cities (""Cook dweeppunjer kono shohor ney..."").  Hawaii definitely has cities.



"

কারণ, অনুচ্ছেদে বলা হয়েছে Rarotonga এবং Aitutaki হল মূল দ্বীপ দুটি, কিন্তু এদের শহর হিসেবে উল্লেখ করা হয়নি। Cook Islands-এর কোনো শহর নেই, এটি ১৫টি পৃথক দ্বীপ নিয়ে গঠিত।

অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলি অনুচ্ছেদে উল্লেখিত তথ্যের সাথে সঙ্গতিপূর্ণ:

Nicher kon ranger station dui dhoroner thakar bikolpo offer kore?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirenate**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sirena holo ekmatro bhromonmulok station jaa campinger pashapashi asthaie thaakar byabostha ebong garam khabar sarbaraha korey."" (Sirena is the only ranger station that offers both camping facilities and hot food).

This means Sirenate is the only station offering *two* types of accommodation/service - camping and food. The other stations only offer camping.

"Onuchchhed ti onujayee, apni jodi credit er poriborte nogod byabohar korte chan, tahole apni kothay park parmit sanrakkhito korte paren?","The correct answer is **B: Puerto Jiménez**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Puerto Jimenejer ranger station thekey parker jonno permit neoa sombhob, kintu taaraa credit card naay."" This directly translates to ""Park permits can be obtained from the ranger station in Puerto Jiménez, but they do not accept credit cards.""  Since the question asks where you can get a permit if you want to pay with cash (instead of credit card), Puerto Jiménez is the only option provided that fits this criteria.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, kharha bhukhonde ki dhoroner skiing kora hoi?","The correct answer is **B: Backcountry skiing**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ei bishoytike Backcountry Ski, Ski Touring baa Ski Hiking bola hoy."" (This subject is called Backcountry Ski, Ski Touring or Ski Hiking). It then goes on to describe that *kharha bhukhande korte hoy* (difficult terrain is traversed) is a characteristic of this type of skiing. While Ski Hiking is mentioned as a name for it, the description heavily leans towards Backcountry Skiing due to the need for tougher skis and boots and considering hiking as the path for skiing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ski hiking:** This is a general term used alongside backcountry skiing and ski touring, not specifically the difficult terrain described.
*   **C: Alpine style:** The passage clarifies that alpine skiing is different and less related to this type of backcountry experience.
*   **D: Ski dwara Backpacking:** This is a broader term encompassing the activity, but not the *type* of skiing done on difficult terrain.

The passage states: ""Backcountry Ski... onek beshi kathin ski ebong booter darkar hoy"" which translates to ""...requires much tougher skis and boots.""  Those aiming for higher speed in backcountry skiing would benefit from these sturdy boots.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bhari backpack (Heavy backpack):** The passage specifically mentions that a heavy backpack hinders speed on groomed tracks, the opposite of what a high-speed skier would want.
* **C: Jothartho poristhiti (Actual situation):** While understanding the situation is important, it isn't a *tool* to aid speed.
* **D: Groomed track (Groomed track):**  The passage explicitly says backcountry skiers *won't* achieve cross-country skiing speeds on groomed tracks with a heavy backpack. They are moving *off* groomed tracks.

Re-entry shock paoya bhromonkarider ki korte giye ekti kothin somoyer mukhomukhi hote hoy?,"The correct answer is **D: Nijerder poribesher sangskritir sathe punoray manate giye (Trying to re-adjust to their own environment's culture)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that re-entry shock happens when returning home after being immersed in a new culture.  It describes the difficulty of *re-integrating* with one's own culture after having adapted to another.  You've lost some habits and perspectives from your original culture while adopting new ones, and readjusting to the familiar is harder than expected.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ekti notun sthaner sangskritir sathe nijederke manate giye (Trying to adapt to a new place's culture):** This describes the initial culture shock *going* abroad, not re-entry shock.
* **B: Dhoirjosheel o bujhte giye (Trying to be patient and understanding):** While being patient is *helpful* in dealing with re-entry shock, it's not the *cause* of the difficulty.
* **C: Bideshe bhromon korte giye (Going to travel abroad):**  This is the act that leads *to* the potential for re-entry shock, not the shock itself.



"
"Onuchchhed ti onujayee, kon dhoroner bhromonarthider kachhe re-entry shock bisheshvabe kothin hote pare?","The correct answer is **A: Je sob bhromonarthi sunirdishtobhabe protikul sangskritir sommukhin hoye aaghat peyechhilen** (Those who were specifically confronted with a hostile culture and experienced trauma).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bhromonkari jara kee naa sahojei notun sangoskarer saathe samanjyasya aante perechilo, kokhono kokhono taader nij sangaskritir saathe punarbinyase kathin somoy paar korte hoy."" (Those who didn't easily adjust to the new culture sometimes have a hard time reintegrating with their own culture). This implies that those who had *difficult* experiences adjusting to a foreign culture – likely due to cultural clashes or a hostile environment – will have a harder time with re-entry shock.  The passage highlights the difficulty of readjusting *after* a challenging experience abroad.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Je sob bhromonkai desher baiere thaakar somoy khub druto nijeder maniye nite paren** (Those who easily adapted to the country while abroad) -  The passage suggests the *opposite* - easy adaptation doesn't necessarily mean easy re-entry.
* **C: Je sob bhromonarthi ekhono honenymoon porjaye royechhen** (Those who are still in the honeymoon phase) -  While the passage *mentions* a honeymoon phase, it states re-entry shock is long-lasting and can be more severe. This option focuses on a temporary stage.
* **D: Je sob bhromonarthir dhoirjyo kom** (Those who have less patience) - While patience is helpful, the passage focuses on the *experience of cultural adjustment* as the key factor, not just personality traits like patience.



"
Manusher Muj saathe konti kora porihar kora uchit?,"The correct answer is **B: Khube dheere egiye jaoya (Approach very slowly)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states that Muj isn't naturally aggressive, but will defend themselves if they perceive a threat. It *also* says they are approachable and playful when not seen as a danger.  This strongly suggests the best course of action is a slow, careful approach.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tader upasthitik obohela kora (Avoid their presence):** While avoiding confrontation is good, the passage implies interaction is possible if done correctly.
* **C: Tader sambhabyo humkir maatra komano (Reduce the perceived threat):** This isn't a proactive approach and doesn't address *how* to interact.
* **D: Taderke ektu dur theke projobekkhon kora (Observe them from a distance):** Observation is good for initial assessment, but doesn't answer the question of *how to interact* if you need to.



"
"Onuchchhed ti onujayee, Muj  somporke nicher kon bibriti ti sotyi noy?","The correct answer is **A: Tara sadharonoto akromonattok parni** (They are generally not aggressive).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Muj (jaa Elk nameo porichito) sahojatobhabe akromonattok noy..."" which translates to ""Muj (also known as Elk) are not aggressive by nature...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect based on the passage:

* **B: Taara majhe majhe sombhabyo humki hisebe bibechito hoi na** (They are sometimes not considered a potential threat) - The passage says they *are* protected if a threat is perceived, implying they aren't *always* seen as harmless.
* **C: Taara khub kom durotwe thaaka manusher lokkhyabostute porinoto hote paare** (They can get very close to humans, resulting in being noticed) - The passage says they can be ""kachakachi"" (close) and ""pheley ditey paare"" (throw themselves into) their enclosure, indicating close proximity.
* **D: Taara proyojone atmorokkha korte pare** (They can defend themselves if necessary) - The passage states they ""attorokkha korbe"" (will protect themselves) if they perceive a threat.



Therefore, option A is the only statement that contradicts the information provided in the passage."
"Onuchchhed onujayee, nicher konti morubhumi bhromonkarir jonno sob cheye kom bipojjonok hobe?","The passage states that chasing mirages, especially if it leads to exhaustion and dehydration, is dangerous. It also mentions that deserts get very cold at night and lacking warm clothes can lead to hypothermia.

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: Thanda raate gorom poshaker ghatti (Lack of warm clothes on a cold night)** - This directly leads to hypothermia, as stated in the passage - a clear danger.
* **B: marichika dekhe joler bhromo howa (Seeing a mirage and being fooled into thinking it's water)** - The passage *mentions* this happens, but doesn't inherently state it's immediately dangerous, just that chasing it *can* be.
* **C: marichikar dike chhute nijer shokti khoy kora (Chasing a mirage and losing your strength)** -  The passage explicitly states that losing your valuation skills and exhausting yourself chasing mirages is dangerous.
* **D: marichikar dike chhutte giye joler apochoy kora (Chasing a mirage and becoming dehydrated)** - The passage specifically says dehydration from chasing mirages is dangerous.

Comparing the options, **B: marichika dekhe joler bhromo howa** is the *least* dangerous.  Simply *seeing* a mirage isn't harmful; the danger comes from *reacting* to it. The other options all describe dangerous *actions* taken because of the mirage.

Therefore, the answer is **B**.



"
Nicher konti morubhumite bhromonkarir jonno sombhabyo humki hisebe ullekh kora hoyni?,"The passage mentions the dangers of mirages (marichika) and hypothermia in deserts. It also implicitly mentions the danger of getting lost while chasing mirages. However, it **doesn't** explicitly mention the danger of getting sunburned (rode pora).

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Rode pora**.
"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, obhijatrider agomoner pore kon goshthir jonosongkhya byapokvabe provabito hoyechhilo?","The correct answer is **C: Taíno**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Europiyo abhijatrider agmoner koyek bochor pore, speniyo bijayider jonno Tynoser janasangkha ullekhjoggobhabe hrass peyechilo 1492 thekey 1498 saaler modhye speniyo bijayira Frey bartlomo the lush casus (Tratado de las indias) anujai pray 100,000 Tanoske hottya korechilo.""

This directly translates to: ""Shortly after the arrival of European colonizers, the Taíno population was significantly reduced, with approximately 100,000 Taínos being killed by the Spanish conquerors between 1492 and 1498.""

Therefore, the population that was dramatically affected after the arrival of colonizers was the **Taíno** people.



"
"Onuchchhed ti onujayee, Caribe ra kon bhashate katha bole?","The correct answer is **D: Arawakan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Je Caribbiyora 10,000 khristopurbabde esechilo taaraa Arawakan-bhashi lok chhilo."" This directly translates to: ""Those Caribs who came 10,000 years BC were Arawakan-speaking people.""

Therefore, the passage indicates that the original inhabitants of the Caribbean spoke Arawakan. While Spanish is now widely spoken in the Dominican Republic (due to Spanish colonization), the question asks about the language of the *original* Caribs.



"
Skiing ke ekti binodonmulok karjokolap hisebe jonopriyo korar krititwo kake deoya jete pare?,"The correct answer is **B: Norwegianra**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...1861 saale Australia tee Norwegianra prothom binodonmulok ski club khole."" (In 1861, the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.) This directly credits the Norwegians with pioneering skiing as a recreational activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ski Bums** - ""Ski Bums"" refers to people who dedicate their holidays to skiing, not those who *made* it popular.
*   **C: Guha basider** - Cave dwellers are mentioned in relation to the *ancient history* of skiing (5000 BC), not its popularization as a recreational activity.
*   **D: Australiyander** - Australians were the location *where* the first recreational club was opened, but the Norwegians were the ones who opened it.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, kon somoye skiingk prothom ekti khela hisebe swikriti deoya hoyechilo ?","The correct answer is **D: 17 shotoke** (17th century).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Downhill Ski kreera hisabe ontoto 17sh shatabdi thekey aachhe..."" which translates to ""Downhill Ski has existed as a sport since the 17th century...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 18 shotoke (18th century):** The passage doesn't mention skiing being recognized as a sport in the 18th century.
*   **B: 5000 Khristo-purbe (5000 BC):** The passage mentions cave paintings *from* 5000 BC depicting skiing, but that's evidence of its *existence*, not when it was *recognized as a sport*.
*   **C: 1861:** 1861 is when the first recreational ski club was opened, but not when skiing was first accepted as a sport.



"
Nicher konti sadharonbhabe purbo African upokuler sob cheye boro dweeper saathe jukto?,"The correct answer is **C: Bonyo prani (Wildlife)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bonnojiboner khettre Madagaskar ekhon porjonto sorbobrihot ekti mahadesh."" (In terms of wildlife, Madagascar is currently the largest country.) This directly links the largest island (Madagascar) to wildlife.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Europiyo prabhab (European influence):** While the passage mentions European influence starting in the 15th century, it doesn't specifically connect it to the *largest* island.
* **B: Islam dhormo (Islam religion):** The passage mentions Islam's presence in Comoros and Mayotte, which are *smaller* islands.
* **D: Bilasbahul resort (Luxury resort):**  The passage states many smaller islands are known as luxury resorts, but doesn't link this to the largest island.



"
Konti opekkhakrito khudro purbo African dweeper boishistho noy? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bonyo pranir jnyo suporichiti (Famous for wildlife)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Madagascar is the largest country in the region and significant for biodiversity (বনজীবনের ক্ষেত্রে Madagaskar...sorbobrihot ekti mahadesh).** It doesn't mention other small islands being particularly known for their wildlife.
* **A: France-er sathe sangjog (Connection with France)** - The passage explicitly states many smaller islands are connected to France.
* **B: Onek bilasbohul resort (Many luxurious resorts)** - The passage mentions these islands are known as luxurious coastal resorts.
* **D: Onnyanyo desher theke swadhinota (Independence from other countries)** - The passage states many are independent nations.

Therefore, being famous for wildlife is the characteristic *not* generally attributed to the smaller eastern African islands in the passage.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Surjoday dekhar jonno kichhu unmukto sthane punorutthan parbone jagroto thaakar ekti reeti royeche"" which translates to ""There is a tradition of staying awake in open places to see the sunrise for the festival of resurrection.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Projonon obyahoto rakhar aachar-onushthan palon:** (Following rituals to keep the lineage unbroken) - This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: Shanibar sara rat jege thekey prarthona:** (Staying awake all night Saturday praying) - While the passage mentions being awake, it specifically links it to *seeing the sunrise*, not just praying all night.
*   **C: Dhormo-sobhar jonyo bosonter aashorer ayojon:** (Organizing spring celebrations for religious gatherings) - The passage mentions a possible connection to spring festivals but doesn’t state they *organize* them. It says the Easter tradition *could be* from those festivals.

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ecuadorer nimanurjai antorjatik bimanbandar baa seemante probesh pointgulor madhyome Ecuadore probesher aage Cuber nagarikder ekti amantran patra grahan korte hoy."" (Ecuadorian immigration requires Cuban citizens entering through international airports or border points to have an invitation letter.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bhromoner tarikher por thekey 6 maas porjonto boidho passport (Passport valid for 6 months after travel date):** While true, the passage states the passport needs to be valid for *at least* 6 months, it isn't the primary requirement *specifically* mentioned for Cuban citizens.
* **C: Thakar somoykal promaner jonno roundtrip ticket (Roundtrip ticket as proof of stay):** This is mentioned as something to *show* but isn't the core requirement to *obtain* entry.
* **D: American green card (American green card):** The passage states those *with* a green card should go to the Ecuadorian embassy for an exemption, meaning it's not a standard requirement, but rather something that allows you to bypass the usual process.

Nicher kontir kharoch nij desher cheye bideshe beshi hote pare?,"The correct answer is **B: beshi daamer braanned frame** (branded frames).

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Oi sob elaka je beshi daamer braanned naamer frame sahoje paoa jaa tate 2 too samasya achhe..."" which translates to ""There are two problems with easily getting high-priced branded frames..."" followed by explanations of why they are more expensive. This directly indicates that branded frames cost more in foreign countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chakkhu porikkha (Eye exam):** The passage suggests getting an eye exam done remotely and bringing the prescription, implying it's *not* necessarily more expensive abroad.
*   **C: Drishti beama (Vision insurance):** The passage doesn't discuss vision insurance costs.
*   **D: Non-brander naamer frame (Non-branded frames):** The passage implies these are *easier* to find abroad, and the cost issue relates specifically to branded frames.



"
Baierer deshe beshi daamer braanned frame khetre somvabyo kon jhunki thakte pare?,"The correct answer is **C: Seguli nokol hote pare (They might be counterfeit)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that high-priced branded frames are easily available in certain areas, and then points out two problems: work being shut down (likely due to illegal production) and goods being significantly more expensive than domestic ones. This strongly suggests the availability of these frames is due to counterfeiting.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Ekti otiriktochakkhu porikkhar proyojon hote pare (An extra eye exam might be required):** The passage doesn't mention anything about needing additional eye exams when buying glasses abroad.
*   **B: Nirdishto kichhu frame-er jonno prescription boidho nao hote pare (Prescriptions might not be valid for certain frames):** This isn't the core issue presented; the problem is *how* the frames are being obtained.
*   **D: Beema kharcha nao dite pare (Insurance might not cover the cost):** While true in many cases, this isn't directly related to the specific problem of cheap branded frames being available in certain areas.

Here's why:

*   The text states that British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, along with US dollars and credit cards in Stanley. This implies British pounds are the most widely accepted currency after the Falkland Pound.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Duroborti dweepe shudhumatro credit card ebong British pounde grihito hoy** - The text says US dollars are *also* accepted in Stanley.
*   **B: Stanley ekmatro jayga jekhane Markin juktorashtrer dollar  grihito hoy** - While Stanley is a major place for accepting US dollars, the text doesn't explicitly state it's the *only* place.
*   **C: Focklands pound dweeppunjo chhere jawar por binimoy koraa jete pare** - The text explicitly states that exchanging Falkland pounds *outside* the islands is very difficult, advising people to exchange them before leaving.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dweeppunjer je kono jaygay sadharonoto British pound ebong **Stanleyte credit card ebong Markin juktorashtrer dollaro** motamuti grihito hoy."" (In most places on the islands, British pounds and **in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars** are generally accepted.)

This directly indicates that US dollars are specifically accepted in Stanley. The passage also mentions that credit card acceptance is limited outside of Stanley.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: FIC West store a:** While the FIC West store is mentioned, the passage doesn't specify that USD is particularly useful *there*. It's just where currency exchange happens.
*   **B: Sobguli dweep jurhe:** The passage implies USD is *not* universally accepted across all islands.
*   **C: Duroborti dweepe:** The passage states credit card acceptance is *less* likely in remote islands.



"
Mondir utsab udjaponer sathe kon anusthan jorito noy?,"The correct answer is **A: Kono hatir jonmo** (The birth of an elephant).

Here's why:

The passage states that temple festivals celebrate annual rituals, the birthdays of deities, or significant events connected to the temple. It specifically mentions decorated elephants and processions as *part* of the festivals, but not as the reason *for* celebrating them.  An elephant's birth isn't listed as a reason for the celebrations.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: Mondir er borshopurti** (Temple anniversary) - This is a significant event connected to the temple.
* **C: Ekjon debotar jonmodin** (Deity's birthday) - The passage directly states festivals celebrate the birthdays of deities.
* **D: Mondirer sathe jorhito prodhan onushthan** (Major rituals connected to the temple) - The passage states festivals celebrate annual rituals of the temples.



"
Sajjito hati kothay dekha jay?,"The correct answer is **C: Mondirer utsaber shobhajatray** (In the processions of the temple festivals).

Here's why:

The passage states ""Keralar mandir utsabguli dekhte khub akarshaniya, **sajjito hatir niyamita shobhajatra**, mandir brindobadon ebong anyanno utsabgulir saathe."" This directly translates to ""Kerala's temple festivals are very attractive, with **regular processions of decorated elephants**, temple bandobadons and other festivals.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Novemberer shes thekey may maser majhamajhi porjonto sobkhane** (Everywhere from the end of November to mid-May): This is the *timeframe* of the festivals, not *where* the decorated elephants are seen.
*   **B: Mondirgulite** (In the temples): While the festivals *happen* at the temples, the passage specifically mentions decorated elephants in the *processions*.
*   **D: Keralar rastay** (On the roads of Kerala): This is too broad. The decorated elephants are specifically part of the temple festival processions, not just randomly on Kerala's roads.

The passage states: ""Prothom baa byabasayik shrenir flaite jatayat korar sobtheke valo upay holo motaa ongker taka pradan koraa (baa aaro valo hoy, jodi aapnar company aapnake eti pradan kore thaake).""  This directly translates to: ""The best way to travel in business or first class is to pay a large amount of money (or even better, if your company provides it).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Byabosayiker poriborte prothom shrenite book kora (Booking first class instead of business class):** The passage doesn't suggest one is inherently better than the other, only that both are expensive.
* **C: Sorasori noy emon ekti prothom shrenir flight book kora (Booking a first class flight directly):** While possible, the passage emphasizes the cost and doesn't focus on *how* to book, but *who* pays.
* **D: Discount khoja (Looking for discounts):** The passage explicitly states these fares are *not* cheap and airlines know people will pay a premium. Discounts are unlikely to be significant.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, nirdishto bharhar shreni book korar somoy konti sandhan kora somoy nosto korbe?","The correct answer is **C: Chhar**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sadharonbhabe bolte gele, A thekey B er sarasari flaite byabosaiek baa prothom shrenir seater jonno chharer sandhan korar kono maane nei."" This translates to: ""Generally speaking, looking for cheap fares on average flights for business or first class seats is meaningless.""

Therefore, searching for a cheap fare (chhar) when booking a specific higher class (business or first class) is a waste of time according to the passage.



"
Sara prithibir bharar sathe Africar mot bharar taalika tulona korar somoy ki jog korar proyojon nei?,"The correct answer is **A: Africar bairer sthaner jonno atirikto visar khoroch** (Additional visa costs for places outside of Africa).

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions to *not forget* to include extra costs like visas, departure charges, and local transportation *for destinations outside of Africa* when comparing the cost of travel to Africa with global travel costs.  This means these costs are crucial for an accurate comparison.

Let's look at why the other options are less direct:

* **B: Africay prosthaner khoroch** (Departure costs from Africa): The passage focuses on *comparing* costs, not the costs *within* Africa.
* **C: African visar khoroch** (African visa costs): The passage focuses on costs related to travel *beyond* Africa when making the comparison.
* **D: Africar bairer sthaner jonno sthal paribahaner khoroch** (Local transportation costs for places outside of Africa): While mentioned, the visa costs are the primary and explicitly highlighted extra expense.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, Supermarket kontir jonno aaro boichitromoy nirbachon offer dite shuru korchhe?","The correct answer is **A: Toiri koraa khabar (Prepared food)**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Oti shighroi super-marketguli readymade khabarer ekti bichitro bibhag hoye uthche."" This directly translates to ""Supermarkets are rapidly becoming a diverse section of ready-made food."" This indicates that supermarkets are offering a wider selection of prepared foods.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Microwave oven:** While some supermarkets *have* microwaves for customers, they aren't what the supermarkets are diversifying *into* offering.
*   **C: On-site restaura:** The passage mentions on-site restaurants but frames them as existing in *some* places, not as a widespread diversification happening in supermarkets generally.
*   **D: Sashrayi mulyo (Subsidized price):** The passage mentions affordability but doesn't say supermarkets are diversifying into offering subsidized prices as a new choice.



"
Prostut-krito khabar kenar somoy kichhu supermarketer deoya kon subidhati kretak aakorshon korte paare?,"The correct answer is **D: Ekti microwave oven**.

Here's why:

The passage states that some supermarkets are providing microwave ovens ""kichhu deshe baa kichhu dhoroner storegulote khabar garam rakhar jonno microwave baa anno byabosthao rakhche"" (in some countries or certain types of stores, they arrange for microwave or other facilities to keep food warm). This is a direct benefit offered to customers buying ready-made food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: On-site restaurant:** While mentioned in the passage, this is presented as a separate feature, not a direct benefit for *buying* prepared food. It's more of an additional service.
*   **B: Kom boichitromoy nirbachon (Less variety):** The passage actually states supermarkets are becoming *more* diverse in their ready-made food offerings (""ekti bichitro bibhag hoye uthche"").
*   **C: Kancha khabar (Raw food):** The passage focuses on ready-made food, not raw ingredients.



"
Nicher konti Farasi bhasi Belgian ebong Swiss ra bujhte parben na?,"Correct answer is **A: Standard Farasi numbering poddhoti**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that while Belgian and Swiss French speakers learn standard French in school and can understand it, they have ""some amazing features"" and different pronunciations, *especially* in numerical systems. This means standard French numbering might not be immediately understood by them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Odvut Farasi shobdo (Unusual French words):** The passage mentions that there are unique features and words, implying they *would* understand these, as these are part of their regional dialects.
*   **C: Farasi shobder nirdishto uchchharon (Specific pronunciations of French words):** While pronunciations differ, the passage states they are understandable to each other.
*   **D: France-e sobcheye beshi bola Farasi shobdo (French words most spoken in France):** The passage says Belgian and Swiss French are mutually intelligible with standard French, so they would likely understand commonly used French words.

"
Nicher konti Belgium othoba Switzerlander moto France-eo ekoi noi?,"Correct answer is **B: Sankhya poddhoti**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Bishesh korey, Farasi bhashi Belgium ebong Switjerlander sankhya poddhotite kichhu adbhut baishishtya royechhe je France-e byabohrito Farasi bhashar cheye alada."" This means numerical systems are different in French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland compared to France.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sob shobder uchcharon (All word pronunciations):** The passage mentions *some* pronunciation differences, not that all pronunciations are different.
*   **C: Schoole shekhano standard Farasi bhasha (Standard French taught in schools):** The passage states schools teach standard French to ensure mutual understanding.
*   **D: Kichhu Farasi shobder banan (Spelling of some French words):** The passage doesn't mention spelling differences."

Here's why:

The passage states that *only certain airlines* provide bereavement fares (শোক সংক্রান্তো ছাড়) – specifically Canada, Delta, and Lufthansa.  WestJet is *not* listed among those airlines. Therefore, if you fly WestJet, you won't be eligible for a bereavement fare.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Apni jodi tritiyo pokkher porishebar poriborte eirline-e sarasari book korar chesta koren** - The passage specifically states you *must* book directly through the airline by phone to get the fare.
* **C: Jodi apni Paris theke Maarkin Juktorashtrer Lufthansate bhromon koren** - Lufthansa *is* one of the airlines offering the fare, so this wouldn't disqualify you.
* **D: Jodi apni Deltate bhromon koren** - Delta *is* one of the airlines offering the fare, so this wouldn't disqualify you.

Shok sangkranto chhar somporke sotyi ti ki?,"The correct answer is **D: Eti oboshyoi phoner madhyome airline-e sorasori book korte hobe** (It is necessary to book directly with the airline over the phone).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**Sob khettre, aapnake aboshyoi sarasari phoner madhyome erlinese book korte hobey.**"" (In all cases, you must book with the airline directly over the phone).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eti ontyeshtikriyate jaoar kharoch bohon koren** (It covers the cost of going to the funeral) - The passage discusses flights for attending funerals, but doesn't say it *covers the cost*.
* **B: Eti oboshyoi airline-er website thekey sorasori book korte hobe** (It is necessary to book directly from the airline's website) - The passage specifically says to book by *phone*, not website.
* **C: Eti shesh muhurter bhromoner khoroch bohon kore** (It covers the cost of last-minute travel) -  It facilitates travel for last-minute situations but doesn't necessarily *cover* the cost.

Kakhon swotontro GPS device byabohar kora GPS dik nirdeshok apper cheye beshi subidhajanak hobe?,"The correct answer is **C: Jakhan apni seemana baire jachchhen** (When you are going outside of the specified limits).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""aapnar phoner jonno jodi kono deta sangjog naa thaake baa jokhon eti nirdishto seemana atibahito kore feley, tokhon taader karjo sampadan seemito baa karjokor naa hote paare.""  This means smartphone GPS apps are limited or won't work when data connection is unavailable or when you go beyond certain boundaries.  A standalone GPS device doesn't have these limitations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jakhon aapni taaka bachanor cheshta korben** (When you are trying to save money) - The passage doesn't discuss cost.
* **B: Jakhon apni nishchito thaaken je apnar kachhe ekti data sangjog thakbe** (When you are sure you will have a data connection) -  If you *have* a data connection, a smartphone app works fine. The passage highlights the problem *when you don't*.
* **D: Jakhon apni kono device bharha nite chaiben na** (When you don't want to carry another device) - This is about convenience, not functionality, and isn't addressed in the passage.

Ekti swotontro device-er biporeete GPS dik nirdeshok app byabohar korar jonno konti kono bhalo karon noi?,"Correct answer is **A: Data sangjog niye chinta korar proyojon naa howa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that phone-based GPS apps have limitations when data connection is unavailable or exceeds specific boundaries. A standalone GPS device doesn't rely on data connection, making it a more reliable option where data connectivity is uncertain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ortho sashroy kora (Accurate Navigation):** Both app-based and standalone GPS can offer accurate navigation, depending on the quality of the device/app and map data. The passage states standalone GPS can *ensure* accuracy, but doesn’t mean app-based ones *can’t*.
*   **C: Bharha eriye jaoya (Charging):** Both types of GPS require charging. This isn't a benefit of one over the other.
*   **D: Notun manchitro kenar proyojon na howa (No need to buy new maps):** Both phone apps and standalone devices need map updates, which may require purchases.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""**Je agenter madhyome tumi boraddho kora nischito how seey jeno bivinno dhoroner jayajgulo somporke valo gyansampanna Gelapagos bisheshoggo hoy.**"" (It is important to book through an agent who is knowledgeable about the different types of places in the Galapagos). This directly links to ensuring you have the right kind of experience.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Eki agroher 8 jon jaatrir group hisebe book kora** (Booking as a group of 8 people): While helpful, it doesn't *guarantee* a good fit with your specific interests.
*   **B: kom chahidar morsume book kora** (Booking during the less crowded season): This might avoid full boats but doesn't ensure a knowledgeable tour.
*   **D: Onek aage theke book kora** (Booking far in advance): This helps with availability but doesn't guarantee expertise or a tailored experience.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, nicher konti otithider jua khelay mogno raakhar koushol hisabe byabohar kora hoi na?","The correct answer is **A: Prakritik aalor prachurjo (Abundance of natural light)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes casinos intentionally creating an environment to *keep* guests spending time and money. They do this by:

*   Lack of windows and clocks (disorienting time)
*   Providing food, drinks, and entertainment (keeping guests comfortable)
*   Offering complimentary drinks (encouraging continued play)

Abundance of natural light would actually have the *opposite* effect – it would help people keep track of time and potentially want to leave. It doesn't fit the pattern of techniques casinos use to encourage gambling.

Let's look at why the other options *are* used:

*   **B: binamulye concert ticket er moto pronodona (Free promotions like concert tickets)** - Casinos offer incentives to attract and retain customers.
*   **C: Binamulye swagotosuchok paniyo (Complimentary welcoming drinks)** - The passage specifically mentions free drinks.
*   **D: Ghorhir onuposthiti (Absence of clocks)** - The passage explicitly states that clocks are usually absent."
"Onuchchhed onujayee, ekjon chowkas juari konti eriye jaabe?","The correct answer is **A: Otyodhik moddopaan (Excessive alcohol consumption)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that casinos ""kichhu jaygay paniyo hisabe mod paoa jaay"" (in some places alcohol is served) but also emphasizes ""madakata bichokkhonotar hrass ghotaay ebong samasta dokkho juarira songjoto thaakar gurutto jaane"" (reducing alcohol consumption and the importance of maintaining all legal liabilities). This implies that excessive drinking is a risky behavior a gambler might engage in, and the casino is actively trying to mitigate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Je kono pronodona grohon kora (Accepting any encouragement):** While casinos want guests to have a good time, the passage doesn't specifically warn against accepting encouragement.
*   **C: Ghori ba hat-ghori chek kora (Checking for windows or clocks):** The passage states casinos *lack* windows and clocks to disorient guests. A cautious gambler wouldn't be actively *looking* for these.
*   **D: Nikot tomo prosthan path somporke jene neoya (Knowing the nearest exit route):** The passage specifically mentions difficulty *finding* exit routes, making knowing the route less of a risk.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, kon part of speech ekti bakyer majhkhane boro haater okkhore lekha hoy?","The correct answer is **D: Kria bisheshon (Verb-adjective)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the capitalization rule applies to both verbs (kria) and nouns (bostu) within a sentence, *especially* in the middle of the word. It also mentions using this to differentiate between verbs and nouns. A ""kria bisheshon"" (verb-adjective) combines these two parts of speech – a verb modified by an adjective.  The passage highlights using capitalization to distinguish between different parts of speech, and a verb-adjective fits that description well.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Kria (Verb):** While verbs are mentioned, the passage also includes nouns.
*   **B: Bishessho (Noun):** Nouns are mentioned, but not specifically as the only part of speech capitalized mid-word.
*   **C: Bisheshon (Adjective):** Adjectives alone aren't the primary focus of the capitalization rule described.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, Boro haater okkhore bishessho lekha kontik aaro kothin korte pare?","The correct answer is **B: Kriar modhye parthokyo kora (Distinguishing within verbs)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that using capitalization *within* words, like with ""see"" (tumi), is a useful way to differentiate between things, *especially within verbs and nouns*.  It acknowledges this makes reading more challenging, because you have to identify if a capitalized letter signals a proper noun/verb or just regular capitalization.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Pora (Reading):** While capitalization *affects* reading, it doesn't specifically make distinguishing proper nouns harder, rather it requires more effort in reading.
*   **C: Lekha (Writing):** The passage discusses the impact on *reading* comprehension, not the difficulty of *writing* with this system.
*   **D: Duiti bostur modhye parthokyo kora (Distinguishing between two nouns):** The passage explicitly mentions verbs *alongside* nouns. Distinguishing within verbs is specifically pointed out as a difficulty.

"Malayasia-er grameen anchale, kon ongovongir ortho “Joyee howa”?","The correct answer is **B: Haat narano**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tobe Malaysiay, bisheshoto grameen anchale maloy bhashi manusher modhye er ortho bojhai """"""""Ekhane asso"""""""" jaa shorirer dike tarjani bankanor anurup, ekti ingit jaa kichhu poshchima deshgulite byabohrito hoy ebong sei uddeshyei segulo byabohar koraa uchit."""" 

This translates to: ""But in Malaysia, especially in rural areas among Malay speakers, it means 'Come here' which is a gesture corresponding to pointing with the index finger, a gesture used in some Western countries and should be used for that purpose. "" 

Therefore, in rural Malaysia, raising your hand (haat narano) signifies ""Come here"" or essentially being called over – implying a positive reception or ""joyee howa"" (being welcomed).



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, kon ongovongir ortho holo “Fire asa”?","The correct answer is **C: Haater talu bairer dike kore narano** (Waving the palm outwards).

Here's why:

The passage states that in Spain, British tourists might see someone waving. This wave *could* mean ""come back,"" but it *actually* means goodbye because when saying goodbye, they wave with the palm of their hand turned towards themselves (inward).  This implies the opposite - waving with the palm facing *outwards* is the gesture for ""come here"" or ""come back"" -  ""Fire asa"" (meaning ""come here"").



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, fatol dhorar karon ki?","The correct answer is **B: Osthir himobaho (Unstable glaciers)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Himbahoguli sthir noy, pahar thekey niche probohoman."" (Glaciers are not stable, flowing down from the mountains.) This directly indicates the *reason* for ice falls.  The instability of the glaciers leads to the breaking off of ice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tushaarer setu (Snow bridge):** While the passage *mentions* ice bridges, it doesn't say they *cause* the falls. They are a result of the process, not the cause.
* **C: Borofer guha venge pora (Ice caves collapsing):**  The passage mentions ice caves can collapse, but this isn't the primary driver of the falls.
* **D: Aalga hoye jaoa block ba chaak (Breaking off blocks or chunks):** This describes *what happens* during an ice fall, but not *why* it happens. The instability of the glacier is the underlying reason for the breaking.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, egulir modhye konti tushar setur sahajye lukano jete pare?","The correct answer is **A: Fatol (ফাটল)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*Er jonnei barafe fatal, khaat toiri hoy, jaa hoyto baraf bhangar setu dwara jukto thaake.*"" (Because of this, cracks form in the ice, which may be connected by ice bridges).

This directly indicates that cracks (fatol) can be hidden by ice bridges.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Barofer guha (বরফের গুহা - Ice cave):** The passage mentions ice caves, but doesn't say they are hidden by ice bridges.
*   **C: Deyal (দেয়াল - Wall):** Walls of ice are mentioned, but not as something hidden by bridges.
*   **D: Boro block (বড়ো ব্লক - Large block):** Large blocks break *from* the glacier, they don't hide *within* it using bridges.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, kon sthane jaoyar aage, bhromonkarider otirikto sotorkota obolombon kora uchit?","The correct answer is **B: Gomar charipasher elaka (The area surrounding Goma)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gomar baire jekono ghorar bishoye gobeshona koraa uchit uttor Kivu prodeshe chalte thaka juddher abostha bojhar jonno."" This translates to ""It is advisable to investigate any house outside of Goma to understand the state of the war taking place in the North Kivu province."" 

This directly implies that extra caution is needed when travelling *outside* of Goma itself, due to the ongoing conflict in the surrounding area (North Kivu province).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Neragongo agneyogiri (Neragongo volcano)** - The text mentions the volcano but doesn't warn about extra security needed *to go there*. It focuses on gorilla tracking being *near* the volcano.
*   **C: Town center (Shaharti kendrosthol)** - The text mentions the town center was largely destroyed, but doesn't say it's particularly unsafe. Goma is generally described as relatively safe.
*   **D: Rwanda** - The passage only states Goma is near Rwanda, not that Rwanda itself is unsafe or requires extra caution.



"
Nicher konti Goma-y ekjon bhromonkarir jonno kono bhalo poramorsho hobe na?,"Correct answer is **A: Uttor Kivu- juddho binodonmulok**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that research should be done before leaving Goma due to the ongoing conflict in North Kivu province (""Gomar baire jekono ghorar bishoye gobeshona koraa uchit uttor Kivu prodeshe chalte thaka juddher abostha bojhar jonno"").  Calling a warzone a ""fun place"" is completely inappropriate and a bad recommendation for a tourist.

Let's look at why the other options are reasonable recommendations based on the text:

*   **B: Sashroyee mulyer mountain garila Tracking er jonno ekti bhalo jayga:** The text mentions gorilla tracking opportunities near Neragongo volcano.
*   **C: Ghure beranor jonno motor cycle taxi holo bhalo madhyom:** The text specifically suggests using ""Boda-Boda"" (motorcycle taxis) for getting around Goma.
*   **D: Neragongo agneyogirir ghati shahare abosthito:** The text confirms Goma is near Neragongo volcano.



"
August a shurur diner jonno backantory anumati kakhan upolobdho hobe?,"The correct answer is **A: 1 january**.

Here's why:

The text states that a backcountry permit for a start date in any given month becomes available on January 1st. Since the question asks about August, the permit would be available starting January 1st.
"
khad  banchanor korar jonno kon neeti royechhe?,"The correct answer is **D: Simito snongkhyok anumati**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Khad banchanor jonno kom anumodan paoa jaa"" which translates to ""Few permissions are granted for rim camping."" This directly indicates a limited number of permits are available.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Age asole age sujog poddhoti** (First come, first served) - While there's an element of applying early, it's not solely first-come, first-served as the passage mentions applying four months in advance.
*   **B: Anumati shudhumatro 1 januarytei upolobdho** (Permits are only available on January 1st) - The passage says permits are valid from January 1st *if* applied for four months prior, not that they become available *on* January 1st.
*   **C: Anumati shudhumatro sarasari uposthit hoye anurodher madhyomei pawa jete pare** (Permits are only obtained through average attendance requests) - This is not mentioned in the passage. It says some previous permits were issued based on average attendance, but that's not the general method.



"
Onuchchhede bornito ghoranar hotele nicher konti kom pawa jete paare?,"The correct answer is **C: Soho otithi jara suporichito ba sweekrito** (Guests who are well-known or accepted).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Ei hotelgulite seii somoyer dhonee oo bikhyato bektira thakten ebong prayoshoi sandhyabhoj ebong ratrikalin amode somoy kataten."" (These hotels were frequented by the wealthy and famous of the time, and they would spend evenings and nights enjoying dinner and entertainment.) This directly implies the hotels catered to a prestigious clientele.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Cocktail bar:** While possible, the passage doesn't *specifically* mention cocktail bars. It mentions entertainment, which could *include* a bar, but isn't the focus.
* **B: Onsite gourmet restaurant:**  The passage mentions dinner (""prayoshoi sandhyabhoj""), suggesting a restaurant, but doesn't emphasize its gourmet quality.
* **D: adhunik upgrade soho somproti songskar kora kokkho:** (Areas renovated with modern upgrades) The passage explicitly describes these hotels as having ""purano dhoroner jinispatra, adhunik sujog subidhar abhab"" (old-fashioned furnishings, lacking modern amenities).  This makes modern renovations unlikely.



"
"Onuchchhede bornito tothyer upor vitti kore, hoteler otithira nicher kon offerk agradhikar deoyar sombhabona kom?","The correct answer is **D: Kokkher sashroyi mulyo (Luxurious prices)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes hotels from before World War II – a time of steam engines, opulent ships, and a ""golden age."" These hotels catered to the wealthy elite (owners, dignitaries, famous people).  The passage emphasizes their exclusivity and the *limitations* they had – lack of modern amenities, specific clientele.

Let's break down why the other options are *more* likely to be offered:

*   **A: Puro proparty jure pracheen grihosojjar samogri (Antique furnishings throughout the property):**  This fits the description perfectly! These hotels would have been decorated with items reflecting the era.
*   **B: Ekjon bishishto chef soho restaurant (A restaurant with a renowned chef):** Catering to a wealthy clientele would *require* high-quality dining, and a famous chef is a good way to provide that.
*   **C: Ratrikalin binodon offer kore emon ekti lounge (A lounge offering evening entertainment):**  The passage explicitly mentions ""ratrikalin amode"" (evening entertainment) as part of the experience.

However, **D: Kokkher sashroyi mulyo (Luxurious prices)** is *implied* rather than an ""offer."" It's a *result* of the hotel's nature, not something they'd actively promote as a benefit to guests. The passage focuses on the experience *because* of the wealth of the patrons, not offering a high price point as an attraction. In fact, a focus on extremely high prices might deter even wealthy travelers.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, Greenlande bhromonkarider konti erano uchit?","The correct answer is **A: Uccho aporadher harer jonno porichito kichhu elaka** (Areas known for high crime rates).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""**emoni shahareo kono """"""""kharap sthan"""""""" nei.**"" (even the cities don't have any ""bad areas""). This implies Greenlande is *not* known for high crime rates. The question asks what tourists should *expect*, and the passage highlights the *lack* of dangerous areas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bhari poshak aana, karon ekhaner jolobayu sadharonoto sara bochhor e ushno thake** (Bring warm clothes, because the climate is generally warm throughout the year):  The passage clearly states the opposite – you need warm clothes due to the cold climate, especially in winter.
* **C: Sekhane thaka abosthay kaaj korar aasha kora, karon internet sangjoge samasya hote paare** (Expect difficulty working there, because there might be problems with internet connectivity): The passage indicates good internet access is available.
* **D: Greenland er ekjon sthaniyo basinda ke “Eskimo” bole ullekh kora** (Referring to a local resident of Greenland as “Eskimo”): The passage explicitly states that using the term ""Eskimo"" is offensive and to avoid it, preferring ""Inuit"" or ""Greenlander.""



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, nicher konti Greenlande-e prostuti niye na aasha bhromonkarider jonyo sob cheye beshi somosyar hote paare?","The correct answer is **A: Nordic mosha (Midges)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Garam kaale Nordic mashar oporo najar din. taaraa kono rog naa chharaleo biroktikor hote paare."" This translates to: ""Pay attention to Nordic midges in the warm season. They can be irritating even if they don't carry any disease.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oporadh (Crime):** The passage explicitly states Greenland is known for *not* having crime and doesn't have any ""bad areas.""
* **C: Abohaoya (Weather):** While the passage mentions the potential for extreme cold, it frames this as something to prepare for with appropriate clothing, not a major problem *during* the visit.
* **D: Sthaniyora (Locals):** The passage emphasizes respecting the local people and their preferred terms for themselves, and doesn't indicate they pose a problem for tourists.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, nicher konti Jordan de la Unión a pawa jay na?","Correct answer is **D: Kono purono convent bhawan**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""Templo de San Diego ekmatro tike thaka bhawan"" (Templo de San Diego is the only remaining building). It doesn't mention any other type of building like a convent. The other options are all mentioned in the text:

*   **A: Concerter ayojon soho kholamela sthaan** - Central Gajebo thekey free concert deoa hoy (Free concerts are given from Central Gazebo)
*   **B: Kono purono premer golper bari** - Callejon del Beso is described as the place of an ancient legendary lover.
*   **C: Bagan-mukhi restaura** - Baganer charpashe koyekti restaura royeche (Several restaurants are located around the garden)."
"Onuchchhed onujayee, diner belay Porbot arohan  somporke nicher bibritigulir konti bhul bole bibechito hobe?","The correct answer is **D: Shishu achhe emon poribarer jonno dine porbot arohan kono upojukto outdoorer kaj noy** (Daytime mountain climbing is not a suitable outdoor activity for families with young children).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Seii poribargulir beshi byabostha proyojan jekhane chhoto bachchara aachhe, kintu emonki shishuder oo prac-bidyaloy bachchader niyeo ekdin baarir baire jaoa sahojei sombhob."" (More arrangements are needed where there are young children, but even with preschoolers, going out for a day is easily possible).

This directly contradicts option D, which claims it's *not* suitable.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Diner belay sahoj traile hiker jonyo samanno prostutir proyojon** (Daytime easy trails require basic preparation for hikers) - The passage mentions ""Ek diner jonno samanno prostuti niyeo ekaa kono haike jaoa jaay"" (You can go hiking alone with basic preparation for a day).
* **B: Durotto poribortito hoy, kintu ek diner byabodhane otikrom koraa jaay** (Distance varies, but can be completed within a day) - The passage says “Ek mailer com thekey shuru korey beshi durotto jaa kina ekdine paree deyaa jaay tototuku porjonto” (Starting from a mile, can range to distances that can be completed in a day).
* **C: Majhari porjayer sobol bektira sadharonoto ei kajti upobhog korte paren** (People of average fitness generally enjoy this activity) - The passage states ""jaa je kono parishrami bekti upobhog korte paare"" (which any hardworking person can enjoy).



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, dine Porbot arohaner jonno kakhon nyunotomo prostutir proyojon hoy?","The correct answer is **B: Jakhon etite ekti sahoj trail jorhito thake (When it involves an easy trail)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ek diner jonno samanno prostuti niyeo ekaa kono haike jaoa jaay jaa je kono parishrami bekti upobhog korte paare."" This translates to ""Even with minimal preparation, one can go for a hike that a hardworking person can enjoy."" This implies that an easy trail requires less preparation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jakhon hiker sharirikvabe fit thaken (When the hiker is physically fit):** While fitness is helpful, the passage doesn't state it's *necessary* for a hike with minimal preparation.
* **C: Shishura jakhan hike a jaay (When children go on the hike):** The passage *mentions* children requiring more preparation, making this the opposite of minimal preparation.
* **D: Jakhon hike aro prakitik poribeshe hoi (When the hike is in a natural environment):**  The passage describes mountain climbing *as* an outdoor activity, but doesn't tie minimal preparation to *where* it is.



"
Norway er baki ongsher tulonay Rogaland ba Agder malvumir parthokyo ki? ,"The correct answer is **A: Segulite gachh achhe (They have trees)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Rogaland ebong Aagder, taader sadharonoto """"""""Hei"""""""" bola hoy jaar ortho gachhin jolabhumi jaa prayashai latapatay ddheke thaake."" This translates to ""Rogaland and Agder are commonly called """"""""Hei"""""""" which means wooded wetlands that are often hanging down.""
* **The passage also states:** ""Ei malvumigulike prayashai """"""""Videdi"""""""" bola hoy jaar ortho holo proshosto, unmukto brikkhobihin sthan, ekti seemahin bistriti."" This translates to ""These plateaus are commonly called """"""""Videdi"""""""" which means clearly, open, treeless places, a limited expanse.""

This directly contrasts Rogaland and Agder (Hei - wooded) with the general Norwegian plateau (Videdi - treeless). The key difference is the presence of trees.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sekhane kono samudrik khaanri nei (There is no marine erosion there):** The passage states marine erosion *is* common in Norway generally.
* **C: Malvumigulir beshirbhag e samatal (Most of the plateaus are flat):** The passage describes them as ""unchu, com-beshi samatal"" (high, somewhat flat) - not entirely flat.
* **D: Eguli prayashai gulmobishesh-e dhaka thake (These are often covered in shrubs):** The passage doesn't mention shrub coverage specifically, only trees in the case of Rogaland and Agder.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, nicher konti Norwayer jonyo sadharon noi?","The correct answer is **A: Unmukto gachhin jomi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Norwayer jonno sadharan byapar holo khara samudra khaanri ebong upottoka jaa hothat korey ekti unchu, com-beshi samatal malvumir dike jatra korey."" (For Norwegians, the common feature is the salty sea and coasts which suddenly travel towards a high, relatively flat moorland.) It also defines ""malvumi"" as ""Videdi"" meaning open, treeless land, an expansive area.
* It *also* states Rogaland and Aagder are commonly called ""Hei"", meaning marshy land which is often very muddy.
* **Unmukto gachhin jomi (Open treeless land)** *is* described as typical (as ""Videdi"" or moorland), but the passage specifically contrasts it with the *coastal* and *marshy* regions, implying that it's the transition *to* this type of land that's common, not the land itself being the primary common feature.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oronnyye dhaka malvumi (Roughly covered moorland):** This aligns with the description of ""malvumi"" and ""Videdi.""
* **C: Somudrer khaanri (Salty sea):** The passage directly states this is a common feature for Norwegians.
* **D: Moorland:** Directly equivalent to ""malvumi"" and ""Videdi"", therefore a common feature.

Skiing a agrohi bhromonkarider kakhon hill statione ghurte jaoya uchit?,"The correct answer is **A: Sheeter somoy (Winter time)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...sheeter somoy taader nana rokomer soundorjo ebong akarshan thaake, onek hill statione valo porimane tusharpat hoye thaake ebong skiing ebong snowboardinger moto bishoyguli koraa jaay.""  ( ""...during the winter time they have various beauties and attractions, many hill stations receive good amounts of snowfall and activities like skiing and snowboarding can be done."")

Since skiing is mentioned as an activity done during the winter due to snowfall, the best time for tourists interested in skiing to visit hill stations is winter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sekhankar porjoton mousume (Throughout the tourist season):** While hill stations are visited year-round, skiing specifically requires snow, which is present only in winter.
* **C: Bharatiya grisser somoy (Indian summer time):**  There's no snow for skiing in the summer.
* **D: Bosonter somoy (Spring time):** Snow is melting in spring, making it unsuitable for skiing.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, hill statione sadharonoto sob cheye beshi porjotok kakhon thake?","The correct answer is **A: Bhari tusharpater somoy** (During heavy snowfall).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...onek hill statione valo porimane tusharpat hoye thaake ebong skiing ebong snowboardinger moto bishoyguli koraa jaay."" (In many hill stations, there is good snowfall and activities like skiing and snowboarding are done). This directly links peak tourist season to snowfall.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Snowboardinger moushum jure:** While snowboarding is *an activity* during the peak season, it's not the season itself. The season *allows* for snowboarding.
* **C: Bharatiya grisser somoy:** (Indian summer) The passage highlights the beauty of the hills *during* winter, not summer.
* **D: Sheet kaaler mash jure:** (Throughout the cold season) While the cold season is relevant, the passage specifically mentions the *amount of snowfall* as a key attraction.  Heavy snowfall is the peak, not just any cold weather.

Apni jodi sahajyer jonno kono nauka khuje pete chaan tobe aapnar ki kora eraano uchit?,"The correct answer is **A: Dock er upore ebong niche haata** (Wave your hands above and below the dock).

Here's why:

The passage (P) specifically mentions ""docke paychari korben"" which translates to ""wave at the dock"". This is the direct action the passage suggests to signal for help. The passage also mentions that once people know you, they will ""ingit debe"" (give signals) if they see a boat looking for you.  Waving is the initial action to *become* known.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Captain der sathe bondhuttwo kora** (Befriend the captains) - While building rapport is good, the passage doesn't prioritize this as the *first* step.
* **C: Apnar porisheba gulir biggapon kora** (Advertise your services) - This refers to *offering* help, not *seeking* it.
* **D: Sohojatri nauka bhromonkarider opekkha kora** (Wait for passenger boats to pass) - This is passive and doesn't actively seek help.



"
Sahajyer proyojon achhe emon ekti naukar sondhan korar samay apni marinar charpashe ki korben?,"The correct answer is **A: Nabikder saathe jogajog koben (I will communicate with the sailors)**.

**Explanation:**

The passage (P) specifically mentions ""baarey nabikder saathe jogajoger chesta korben"" - meaning ""try to communicate with the sailors on the dock"". This directly corresponds to option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Radarer niche thakben (I will stay under the radar):** The passage encourages interaction, not hiding.
* **C: Lokera jakhon yacht porishkar korchhe kebol takhoni taader kaachhe jaaben (I will only go to them when people are cleaning the yacht):**  The passage suggests broader interaction, not limiting it to yacht cleaning.
* **D: sohojatri hitchhikerder erhiye cholben (I will follow along with passenger hitchhikers):** This isn't mentioned in the passage at all.



"
Dweeper ouponibeshik itihase agrohi bhromonkarik kon sthanti akorshon korbe?,"The correct answer is **B: Collown Waterfront**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""jodi ei anchaler ouponibeshik atiter proman khunjen tobe seta shuru korar jonno eti valo jayga"" (if you search for proof of the colonial past of this region, this is a good place to start) referring to the area opposite Collown Waterfront. This directly links Collown Waterfront to the region's colonial history, making it the most relevant attraction for someone interested in that aspect.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Uttorer upokul (Northern Coast):** While development is concentrated there, the passage doesn't mention its connection to colonial history.
*   **C: Downtown HongKong:** This is a general area, and the passage doesn't specifically link it to colonial history.
*   **D: Victoria Harber (Victoria Harbour):**  The passage mentions the skyline *over* the harbor, but doesn't connect the harbor itself to colonial history.



"
Ononnyo drishyak agradhikar daay emon porjotoker kachhe kon sthantik akorshoniyo mone hobe?,"The correct answer is **D: Kowloon waterfront**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hongkong-er sorbochcho drishyar jonno, ba-dweep thekey beriye por ebong **Collown Waterfront opposite-er dike egie jaao**."" (For the best view of Hong Kong, go beyond the island and towards the opposite side of **Kowloon Waterfront**).

This directly indicates that Kowloon Waterfront is recommended for a good view and thus would be attractive to tourists seeking scenic spots.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Victoria Harber:** While mentioned, the passage focuses on *viewing* the harbor *from* Kowloon Waterfront, not the harbor itself as a place to go.
*   **B: Prokrito HongKong (Natural Hong Kong):** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Hong Kong Dweep (Hong Kong Island):** The passage suggests going *beyond* the island for the best view."
Kichhu saddle-e emon ki aachhe ja ekjon ashwarohir  paa-daane atke jaoyar jhunki komate sahajyo kore?,"The correct answer is **B: Surakkha baar**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""কয়েকটি saddle, বিশেষ করে ইংরেজি saddlegulir সুরক্ষা baar রয়েচ্ছে যা একটি পারদর্শী riderer দ্বারা পিছন থেকে টানলে একটি স্ট্রাপ চামড়া জিন থেকে ছুটে যেতে দেয়।"" This translates to: ""Some saddles, especially English saddles, have a safety bar that can be released from the back by a skilled rider from a strap of leather gin."" This safety bar is specifically mentioned as a feature that helps reduce the risk of a rider's foot getting stuck in the stirrup.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Soru padatal (Short padatal/footrest):** While the passage mentions short padatals, it doesn't say they *help* prevent getting stuck, just that they are common.
*   **C: Chamraar rekab (Leather stirrup):** The passage mentions stirrups made of leather, but doesn't link them to increased safety.
*   **D: Odhik sthitisheelota (More stability):** Stability is a general benefit of a good saddle, but the passage doesn't state it directly reduces the risk of getting your foot caught."
Ghoray chorar booter kon boishishtyoti paa-daan byabohar korar somoy arohir nirapotta barate sahajyo kore?,"The correct answer is **A: Rukkho, soru padatal**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""beshirbhag ashwarohira ashwachalana boot pore jaate hill thaake ebong ekti mosrin, pray soru, padatal thaake."" This translates to ""most riders wear riding boots that have heels and a small, soft sole."" These features provide a secure footing and prevent the foot from sliding through the stirrup, thus increasing safety.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Chamrha (Leather):** While saddles may *have* leather, the passage specifically mentions the heel and sole of the boot as important safety features.
*   **C: Hill (Heel):**  While the heel is mentioned as part of the boot, ""rukkho, soru padatal"" (heel, soft sole) is the complete description of the helpful boot feature.
*   **D: Ekti chowrha sole (A square sole):** The passage explicitly mentions a *soft* sole (""soru padatal""), not a square one.



"
Hospitality Exchange Networker madhyome bhromonkarider ki deoya hoi?,"The correct answer is **A: Sthaniyo hostder sathe thakar byabostha** (Arrangements to stay with local hosts).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Hospitality Exchange Networks ""connect travelers with locals who offer accommodation."" This directly translates to providing arrangements to stay with local hosts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sostar flight** - The passage mentions Casey Fenton being *unable* to find accommodation, not flights.
*   **C: Sthaniyo guideder sahojogitay tour** - While interaction with locals is part of the experience, the core offering is accommodation, not guided tours.
*   **D: Eke gontobye aasa anyanno bhromonkarider sathe jogajog** - The passage mentions reviews and discussions *among* travelers, but this isn't the primary service provided by the network. It's a secondary benefit.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, shared hostel roome kon dhoroner atithi kom pawa jay?","The correct answer is **C: Chhoto bachchader niye bhromon korchhe emon otithi (Guests traveling with small children)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while younger travelers are common in hostels, it's a ""rare sight"" to see families with children. This implies families with small children are the least likely type of guest you'd find in a shared hostel room.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sodyo kuri bochor paar korechhe emon atithi (Guests who have just turned 18):** The passage specifically states that many guests are around 18 years old.
*   **B: Eka bhromon korchhen emon atithi (Solo travelers):** Hostels are very common for solo travelers.
*   **D: Modhyo tirish bochor boyeshi atithi (Guests in their mid-thirties):** The passage mentions you *may* find older travelers, so this isn't the least common.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, kar hostele thakaar sombhabona sobcheye beshi?","The passage states that hostels primarily cater to young travelers, generally around 20 years old, but you may also find older tourists. It also mentions that families with children are a rare sight, but *some* hostels allow them to stay in private rooms.

Considering this, let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Sathe nabojatok royechhe emon dampoti (A couple with a newborn):** Families with young children are rare in hostels, making this unlikely.
*   **B: Tinjon 22 bochor boyeshi jara eksathe bhromon korchhen (Three 22-year-old travelers):** This perfectly fits the typical hostel demographic of young travelers around 20 years old.
*   **C: 70 bochorer beshi boyeshi dampati (A couple over 70 years old):** While older tourists *can* be found, they aren't the primary target audience.
*   **D: Duti poribar jara tader santander niye bhromon korchhen (Two families traveling with their children):** The passage specifically states families with children are uncommon.

Therefore, the most likely group to stay in a hostel, according to the passage, is **B: Tinjon 22 bochor boyeshi jara eksathe bhromon korchhen**.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, nicher kon bibriti ti boomerang chora k sothikvabe bornona kore?","The correct answer is **B: Eti bhromonkarider cheye sthaniyoder modhye beshi jonopriyo** (It is more popular among locals than tourists).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Boomerang chora ekti janapriya dokkhota jaa bahu porjotok shikhte chan."" (Boomerang throwing is a popular activity that many tourists want to learn.) This directly implies it's *tourists* who are particularly interested in learning, not locals.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

* **A: Sothikvabe nikkhep korle eti sorboda aapnar haate fire aasbe** (If thrown correctly, it will most likely return to your hand) - This is stated in the first sentence.
* **C: Australiate khub beshi boomerang pawa jay na** (Not many boomerangs are found in Australia) - The passage says, ""Australiate jesob boomerang paoa jaay, taar odhikangshoi fire asena"" (Most of the boomerangs found in Australia do not return). This implies limited availability of *returning* boomerangs.
* **D: Shudhumatro kichhu boomerang fire aste paare** (Only some boomerangs can return) -  Also supported by the statement about Australian boomerangs not typically returning.

Therefore, option B is the only statement *not* supported by the text."

The text specifically mentions ""Javanese narikeler chini"" (coconut sugar) as a key ingredient in Javanese cuisine, highlighting its importance along with almonds, chili, and other spices. The other options (sada chini, guro chini, badami chini) are not mentioned in the text.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, kivabe ekti  chonache rog chharay?","The correct answer is **A: Sangkramito byaktir madhyome (Through an infected person)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ekti sangkramak rog holo ekti rog jeti ekjon akranto rogir sannidhye jaoar madhyome chharay."" This translates to ""An infectious disease is a disease that spreads through proximity to an infected person.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pathogener madhyome (Through a pathogen):** While pathogens *cause* infectious diseases, the passage specifically says how the disease *spreads* – through contact with an infected person.
* **C: Bacteriumer madhyome (Through bacteria):** Bacteria are *a type* of pathogen, but the passage doesn't limit spread to just bacteria. It includes viruses, fungi, and parasites.
* **D: Tikar madyome (Through a vaccine):** Vaccines *prevent* disease, they don't spread it.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, konti sangkramok rog chharay bole jaana jaay ni?","The correct answer is **A: Tika (Vaccine)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that infectious diseases are *caused* by viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites (pathogens). It also mentions vaccines are *given* to prevent these diseases, especially to travelers.  Vaccines don't *spread* the disease; they *protect* against it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Viruse (Viruses):** Viruses *are* infectious agents that spread disease.
*   **C: Bacterium (Bacteria):** Bacteria *are* infectious agents that spread disease.
*   **D: Chhatrak (Fungi):** Fungi *are* infectious agents that spread disease.

Therefore, the passage implies that a vaccine is not something that is spread like an infectious disease."

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that web proxies *only* reroute HTTP traffic, while VPNs reroute *all* internet traffic. If a user only needs to reroute HTTP traffic, a web proxy is sufficient and potentially a more lightweight solution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Byaboharkari samasta traffic punoray root korte chaile:** The passage states VPNs are better because they reroute all traffic. If this is the goal, a VPN is the better choice.
*   **B: Byaboharkari censorship ebong guptacharbritti erano niye beshi udwigno hole:**  The passage highlights VPNs are good for circumventing censorship *and* are encrypted, making surveillance harder. This favors a VPN.
*   **D: Byaboharkarir karjokolaper jonno majhari theke uchcho storer bandwidth proyojon hole:** The passage says VPNs generally offer higher bandwidth. This favors a VPN.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that VPNs re-route *all* internet traffic, not just HTTP traffic. It contrasts this with web proxies which may only handle HTTP.  Therefore, option D directly contradicts the information provided in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: VPN sadharonoto web proxir tulonay uchcho bandwidth offer kore** - The passage says VPNs generally have ""uchchotoro bandwidth"" (higher bandwidth).
*   **B: Web proxi samasta web traffic k punoray root korte pare na** - The passage states VPNs re-route *all* traffic, implying proxies do not.
*   **C: VPN er tulonay web proxir sebar man kom** - The passage mentions VPNs usually offer ""unnoto seba"" (better service), suggesting proxies are less sophisticated and therefore likely cheaper."
Konti kauke tader nikotborti elakar baire ekti phone company byabohar korar sujog daay?,"The correct answer is **A: Internet routed call**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Callguli interneter madhyome chaalito howar karone aapni jekhane thaken baa apni jekhane bhromon karen sekhankar kono phone sanstha byabohar korar darkar nei."" (Because Callguli operates over the internet, you don't need to use a phone company where you live or travel.) This directly refers to calls being routed through the internet, allowing you to bypass traditional phone companies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Global phone number:** While you *need* a global phone number to receive PSTN calls, it doesn't *provide* the ability to avoid a local phone company. It's a consequence of using the system, not the method itself.
* **C: Satellite:** Satellite internet is *how* the connection is achieved in remote areas, but it's the *internet routing* that lets you avoid local phone companies.
* **D: PSTN phone:** PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) is the traditional phone system – the thing you're trying to avoid using!

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ekti sthaniyo phone company byabohar kora** (Using a local phone company) - The passage states you *don't* need a local phone company.
* **C: Apnar sthaniyo community theke ekti number neoya** (Taking a number from your local community) -  The passage says you don't need a local number.
* **D: Ekti PSTN phone kena** (Buying a PSTN phone) - The passage mentions needing to *access* the PSTN network, not necessarily buy a PSTN phone itself.  The global number facilitates access to the PSTN.

Nicher konti Italian shabdagulir uchcharon sothikbhabe bornona kore na?,"The correct answer is **D: Beshirbhag shabder uchcharon poroborti swarbarner upor vitti korey poribortito hoy.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Italian pronunciation is *easy* because words are largely pronounced as they are written. It highlights that 'c' and 'g' are the main letters where pronunciation *changes* based on the following vowel, but this is presented as something to *watch out for* – not the general rule.  Option D contradicts the core idea of the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Ekti double aar ekti single aar theke aladavabe uchcharito hoi** - The passage explicitly states the different pronunciations of ""ara"" and ""aar"".
*   **B: Beshirbhag shabda jevabe lekha hoi sevabei uchcharito hoi** - This is the main point the passage makes about Italian pronunciation.
*   **C: c ebong g akkhar jukto shabdaguli kothin hote pare** - The passage specifically mentions that 'c' and 'g' can be tricky depending on the following vowel.



"
Ijmir er nicher boishishtyogulir modhye konti adhunik diner aage udvuto hoyechhilo?,"The correct answer is **D: Laal-taalir chhad (Red-tiled roofs)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""oitijjobahi laal-taalir chhad achchadito thakto, 18 shatabdir bajar ebong puratan masjid ebong girjaguli"" which means the red-tiled roofs are historical and covered the 18th-century bazaars, old mosques, and churches. This indicates they existed *before* the modern developments like wide roads, glass-covered buildings, and shopping centers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chaoraa rasta (Wide roads):** The passage describes them as part of the modern city.
*   **B: Kancher achchadonjukto bhawan (Glass-covered buildings):** These are clearly described as modern.
*   **C: Shopping kendro (Shopping centers):** Also described as modern.



"
Nicher konti Ijmirer sothik boishishtyo noi?,"The correct answer is **B: Pariparshwik poribesh oitijjobahi Turoskok tule dhore** (The surrounding environment resembles historical Turkey).

Here's why:

The passage states that Izmir's *aura* (atmosphere/feel) is more similar to that of Central Europe than to the history of Turkey. It's a contrast - Izmir doesn't *resemble* historical Turkey in its feel, it resembles Central Europe.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the text:

*   **A: Shohor ti ekti bishal uposagark ghire royechhe** (The city is surrounded by a large bay) - The passage explicitly states this: ""eti ekti bishal uposagor dwara beshtito"" (it is surrounded by a large bay).
*   **C: Apni adhunik shopping kendro ebong puratan girja ubhoye khunje pete paren** (You can find both modern shopping centers and ancient churches) - The text mentions ""adhunik shopping kendrogulo"" (modern shopping centers) and ""puratan masjid ebong girjaguli"" (ancient mosques and churches).
*   **D: Ekhane Turosker dwitiya brihottomo bandar royechhe** (Here is Turkey's second largest port) - The passage states ""Istambuler pore dwitiya brihottomo bandar"" (second largest port after Istanbul).



"
Hanami shobdo ti ki dekhar jonno bojhano hoi?,"The correct answer is **A: Cherry pushpo (Cherry blossoms)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""ater doshok thekey hanami, arthat cherike futote dekha japani sangaskritir ongo"" which translates to ""From ancient times, Hanami, meaning viewing cherry blossoms, is a part of Japanese culture.""  It goes on to describe the cherry blossoms (""cherry pushpo"") being viewed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Japani abhijato tontro (Japanese elite system):** While the passage mentions the elite initially enjoying the blossoms, Hanami itself isn't *about* the elite system.
* **C: Paam pushpo (Palm flowers):** The passage mentions palm flowers as a place *from* which the tradition originated, but Hanami is about cherry blossoms.
* **D: Imperial court:** The Imperial Court was a location where it was *celebrated*, but not what Hanami *is*.



"
Cherry ful dekhar jonno nibedito prothom party guli k host korechhilo?,"The correct answer is **C: Japan er somrat** (The Emperor of Japan).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Japane, prothom cherry pushpo partiguli cable somrater nijer jonno ebong abhijato shrenir anyanno sadasyader imperial courter ashepashe host koraa hoyechilo."" This translates to: ""In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the emperor himself and other members of the elite class around the imperial court.""

Therefore, the emperor of Japan hosted the first cherry blossom viewing parties. While ""abhijato shreni"" (elite class) were *also* present, the passage explicitly states the emperor *hosted* them.  ""Cheaner somrat"" (Chinese emperor) is incorrect as the text discusses Japan."

Here's why:

The passage states that a Wild Card allows access to *several* parks in South Africa, or any national park. If someone is *only* visiting Kruger National Park, they wouldn't benefit from the Wild Card, as it's designed for those visiting multiple parks. They would be better off paying the daily conservation and entry fees for Kruger alone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** A traveler planning to visit SANParks frequently would *benefit* from a Wild Card.
*   **C:** A budget traveler concerned about park fees would likely *benefit* from a Wild Card if they plan to visit enough parks to make the cost worthwhile.
*   **D:** A traveler visiting Kruger and at least one other park would *benefit* from a Wild Card."

The passage specifically states: ""swash dhorey rakhte hobey ebong khanra ongshogulite jotno nite hobey, bisheshoto bheja hole kaaron eti druto bipojjonok hoye uthte paare."" This translates to ""You have to hold your breath and be careful in the steep parts, especially if it's wet because it can quickly become dangerous."" 

While the other options present challenges (rocky paths, small caves, steel cables), the passage *explicitly* identifies wet conditions as a significant and rapid danger.

(Most of the path is covered with stone steps and steel cables are provided for support in the dangerous areas.) This directly contradicts option B, which claims there is no support in the dangerous areas.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Emonki kormokkhom porbotarohidero swas bondho hoye aashar upokrom hote paare** (It is possible for inexperienced climbers to run out of breath) - The passage says ""swash dhorey rakhte hobey"" (you have to control your breath), implying breathlessness is a concern.
* **C: Apnake oboshyoi upore ekti guhar modhye diye jete hobe** (You must go through a cave above) - The passage states ""Uporer kachakachi ekta chhoto guha achhe jeta atikram korte hobey"" (There is a small cave near the top that must be crossed).
* **D: Bhije gele khara ongshoti bipojjonok hoye uthe** (The dangerous parts become dangerous if wet) -  The passage warns ""bheja hole kaaron eti druto bipojjonok hoye uthte paare"" (if it gets wet because it can quickly become dangerous).

"Onuchchheder tathya onujayee, hangi khabar somporkito kon bibrititi sotyi noi?","The correct answer is **A: Geothermal hangite gorto garam korar jonno agun theke uttopto pathar byabohar kora hoy** (In geothermal hangi, heated stones for cooking are heated by fire).

Here's why:

The passage states that geothermal hangi use *naturally heated stones* or stones heated by *geothermal activity* (jolonto pathar thaakar karone anchalti topto thaake, athoba prakritik bhabei kichhu elaka erokom uttopto hoy).  It doesn't mention using fire to heat the stones.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: Wellingtone garam pathar byabohar korte hoy emon hangi pawa jay** (Hangi using heated stones can be found in Wellington) - The passage states ""christchurch, Wellington baa anno kothao paoa jete paare"" (can be found in Christchurch, Wellington or elsewhere).
* **C: Roast raater khabar prayoshoi hangi byabohar kore ranna kora hoi** (Hangi is used to cook food at night for roasts) - The passage states ""Hangi prayashai ekti oitijjobahi roaster moto raater khabar ranna korte byabohrito hoy"" (Hangi is used like a traditional roaster to cook food at night).
* **D: Geothermal hangi Rotoruay paoa jete pare** (Geothermal hangi can be found in Rotorua) - The passage states ""Rotoruay besh koyekti sthan Geothermal Hangi hisabe sarbaraha korey"" (Rotorua supplies many places as a Geothermal Hangi).

Nicher konti hangi pit gorom korar jonno ekti sadharon upay hisabe ullekh kora hoyni?," সঠিক উত্তর হল **A: Gas**।

কারণ:

Kontir karone aapni sannasi ba mathbasinir kach theke bishesh sweekriti paben?,"The correct answer is **A: Ekti ujjal gayee joranor poshak** (A bright, floral dress).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""...jodi aapni nijerta niye ashen, bishesh korey seta jodi ujjal ranger hoy tahole probeshpothe aapni sannasi baa mathbasinir kach thekey hassie upohar paben."" This translates to ""...if you bring your own, especially if it is a bright color, you will receive a gift from the monk or the math's resident when entering.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kandh ddheke asha (Shoulder covered):** While the text mentions covering shoulders, it doesn't state this leads to a gift.
*   **C: Moth theke ekti aboron dhaar kora (Wearing jewelry from the head):** The text doesn't mention jewelry.
*   **D: Hantur upore kata skirt pora (Wearing a skirt cut above the knees):** The text mentions skirts, but specifically states bringing your *own* bright dress leads to the gift, not just wearing a short skirt.



"
Nicher kon poshakti moth theke dhar pawa sombhob noi? ,"The correct answer is **A: Skirt**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that while women are *given* skirts to wear at the math (monastery), if you bring your own, especially a bright colored one, you'll be mocked by the monks or monastery residents. It also states you won't feel comfortable wearing the skirts provided because they aren't washed after each use. This implies you cannot reliably *obtain* or *wear* a skirt from the math itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Shorts** - The text doesn't mention anything about shorts.
*   **C: Trousers** - The text specifically says men *must* wear trousers that cover their ankles and these can be obtained from the entrance store.
*   **D: Gaaye joranor aboron** - This translates to ""cowherds' attire,"" which the text says is given to women who arrive unprepared. So it *is* obtainable at the math.

Antarctic anchol ghure dekhar somoy ekjon darshanarthi kakhon nokkhotro dekhar jonno sobcheye beshi sujog paben? ,"The correct answer is **C: Sheeter maase (In winter)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that visiting the Arctic or Antarctic regions will allow you to experience the polar night, where the sun doesn't rise above the horizon. This creates darker skies, making it a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis *and* observe stars. The passage also says the sky becomes ""alpo-beshi ondhokar hoye thakbe"" (more or less dark) *with time*. This means darker skies are more frequent during the colder months.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Greesher maase (In summer):**  Summer in these regions means almost constant daylight, making star-gazing impossible.
*   **B: Jakhon ei anchol khub beshi janabahul thaake na (When this region is not very populated):** While the passage mentions low population, it's not directly related to the *best time* to see stars.
*   **D: Jakhon alol dushoner maatrA khubi kom thaake (When the amount of light pollution is very low):** This is a positive aspect of the location generally, but the primary factor for better star-gazing is the darkness brought by the polar night, which occurs in winter.



"
Kakhon ekti satellite phone ekti cellphoner karjokori protisthaponkari hobe na?,"The correct answer is **A: Jodi satellite-er dike sight light bighnito hoi** (If the sight line to the satellite is obstructed).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...aapnake kono phone call korar jonno satelliter kachhe sposhto liner saathe unmukto sthane thakte hobey."" ( ""...for any phone call, you have to be in an open space with a clear line of sight to the satellite."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jodi sthaanti onek durer hoi** (If the location is very remote) - The passage *implies* satellite phones are for remote locations, so distance isn't necessarily a reason they *won't* work.
* **C: Jodi eti baire byabohrito hoi** (If it is used outdoors) - Satellite phones are *designed* for outdoor use.
* **D: Jodi kono jaatrar jonyo nirdishto datar proyojon hoi** (If specific data is required for a journey) - The passage states satellite phones are used for situations needing data and voice, making this incorrect.



"
Cellphoneer poribrte satellite phone kakhon grohonjogyo hobe?,"The correct answer is **B: Noukay berate jaoyar somoy (When going boating)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that satellite phones are useful when cellphone coverage is unavailable, and specifically mentions situations where you need connectivity in remote locations. Going boating often takes you to areas with no cellphone signal, making a satellite phone the only option.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kono shohore chhuti katanor samay (When vacationing in a city):** Cities generally have excellent cellphone coverage.
*   **C: Jakhon remote data proyojoniyo noi (When remote data is not needed):** If you don't need data, you don't need *any* phone, satellite or otherwise.
*   **D: Jakhan apnar porjapto cellphone coverage paoyar sombhabona thake (When there is a possibility of getting adequate cellphone coverage):** The passage emphasizes satellite phones are for when cellphone coverage *doesn't* exist.

Transnistria projatontrer nicher konti royechhe ja Moldova-r baki angsher theke alada?  ,"Correct answer is **C: Jaatisangher sweekriti (Recognition by international community)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Transnistria has its own government and currency but *no* nation has recognized it as a sovereign state. This is the key difference that sets it apart from the rest of Moldova.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bhasha (Language):** The text says Romanian is the official language of Moldova, but Russian is widely used. It doesn't state Transnistria has a different official language.
*   **B: Dhormo (Religion):** The text says Orthodox Christian is the main religion in Moldova, implying it is likely also prevalent in Transnistria.
*   **D: Mudra (Currency):** The text states Transnistria *has* its own currency, but that doesn’t mean it's different from Moldova. Having a currency doesn’t automatically make a region distinct in this context.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, kono bhromonkari jharo bataser poribesh eriye jete chaile taar kakhon Montevideo-te bhromon kora uchit?","The correct answer is **A: Uttor Northern Hemisphere’er sheeter maase (In the Northern Hemisphere's winter months)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Jehetu Montevideo nirakshiya anchaler dakkhine, taai uttor golardhe ebong er biporite jokhon sheet thaake tokhon kharaa hoy.""  This translates to: ""Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is cold when it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.""
* **The question asks:** When is the best time to visit Montevideo if someone wants to experience a cool, breezy environment?

Therefore, to experience a cool environment, you should visit Montevideo when the Northern Hemisphere is experiencing winter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Montevideo’er shushko morshume (Montevideo’s dry season):** The passage states there's no particularly ""dry"" season; rainfall is consistent throughout the year.
* **C: Northern Hemisphere’er greeshmer maase (In the Northern Hemisphere's summer months):**  The passage says it's *hot* in Montevideo during the Northern Hemisphere's summer.
* **D: Montevideo’er sheeter maase (In Montevideo’s winter months):** While it's cooler in Montevideo's winter, the passage emphasizes the contrast with the Northern Hemisphere's summer, and it's the *Northern Hemisphere's* winter that brings the cooler temperatures to Montevideo.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, sheetol jolobayur pokkhopati hole, ekjon bhromonkarike kakhon Montevideo te jete hobe?","The correct answer is **A: Montevideo’er greeshmo kale (Montevideo's summer)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Jehetu Montevideo nirakshiya anchaler dakkhine, taai uttor golardhe ebong er biporite jokhon sheet thaake tokhon kharaa hoy."" (Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is cold when it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa).
* **The passage also states:** ""grisser mashgulite, tapmatra sadharonoto +30°C er beshi hoye thaake."" (During summer, the temperature is usually above +30°C).

The question asks when it's *cold* in Montevideo.  Since Montevideo has summer when the Northern Hemisphere has winter, the *coldest* time in Montevideo would be during its winter, which corresponds to the Northern Hemisphere’s summer.  However, the question asks when to *visit* for cold weather. The passage clarifies that Montevideo is warm in its summer (+30°C), and can get very cold when its winter. Therefore, to experience cold weather, one should visit during Montevideo's summer, which is when the Northern Hemisphere is experiencing winter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Northern Hemisphere’er greeshmo kale (Northern Hemisphere's summer):** The passage specifically states it's *warm* in Montevideo during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer.
* **C: Montevideo’er borshakale (Montevideo’s rainy season):** The passage says rainfall is consistent throughout the year.
* **D: Northern Hemispherer’er sheet kale (Northern Hemisphere’s winter):** This would be *warm* in Montevideo, not cold.

"Onuchchhed ti onujayee, nicher konti dhawngsher biporite, ekjon protishthito graffiti shilpir sathe jorito hobe?","The correct answer is **A: Graffitir event**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ajkal protishthito graffiti shilpi, **grafitir event** ebong """"""""Boidho"""""""" deyal royechhe."" (Nowadays, established graffiti artists are involved with **graffiti events** and ""Boidho"" activities.)

This directly links established graffiti artists to graffiti events.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Elomelo lekha ba chhobi (Random writing or pictures):** The passage contrasts this with the work of established artists, saying their work is more like artwork than random scribbles.
*   **C: Sarkari sompottir upore obanchhito deoyal chitro (Unwanted pictures on public property):** The passage mentions this as a typical *negative* association with graffiti, not something established artists are involved in.
*   **D: Asposhto buli (Vague bullying):** This is not mentioned in the passage at all.



"
Songeet utsober kon dikk kichhu onuraagi obhiggotar gurutwopurno angsho bole mone koren?,"The correct answer is **A: Chhoto sishuder niye aasa (Bringing small children)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kichhu utsabe chhoto bachchader paribargulir jonno bishesh camping korar khettro royechhe."" (Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children). This highlights that catering to families and children is considered a ""গুরুত্বপূর্ণ অংশ"" (important part) of the experience.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Shey Sthane camping kora (Camping at that place)** - While camping is *part* of the event, the passage doesn't emphasize it as a particularly significant aspect for attendees.
* **C: Gobhir raat porjonto songeet chola (Music continuing until late at night)** - This is mentioned as something that *might* happen, but isn't presented as a central, valued component for most attendees.
* **D: Taratari chole aasa (Coming quickly)** - This is a logistical instruction (""pounchote hobey"" - you have to reach) and doesn't represent a feature that attendees find important.

The passage explicitly states: ""যদি এই পদক্ষেপে সামিল হতে চান, তবে আপনাকে সঙ্গীত কেন্দ্রিক কোনো ক্যাম্পিং সাইটে তারাতারি পৌঁছে হতে হবে।"" (If you want to participate in this, you must quickly reach a music-centric camping site.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Raate deri kore jaoya (Staying up late)** - The passage mentions music might continue late into the night, but doesn't suggest this as a requirement to participate.
*   **B: Poribarer jonyo ekti sthane thaka (Staying in a place for the family)** - While there *are* areas for families, it's not a general requirement to be near them.
*   **C: Sthanti thekey dure camp kora (Camping away from the location)** - The passage emphasizes reaching the *music-centric* camping site, meaning being close to the action.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, Uttor New Mexico te, nightlife khojar somoy bhromonpipasuder kon sthan erhiye chola uchit?","The correct answer is **D: Casino**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""aapni Albuquerque baa Santa Fe Ten naa ele 'Nightlife' baa nishipromoder moto kichhu paoa jaabe naa...upore bornito sob casinogulii paniyo poribeshon korey ebong taader modhye besh koyekti brand binodoner naame niye aashe"". This directly translates to: ""If you don't go to Albuquerque or Santa Fe, you won't find 'Nightlife' or anything like that... the casinos mentioned above provide drinks and many brands bring entertainment in their name (especially around Albuquerque and Santa Fe)"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pueblos:** The passage explicitly states pueblos *don't* have nightlife.
*   **B: Choto choto town bar (Small town bars):** The passage warns these aren't good for long stays due to problems with drunk drivers and drug use.
*   **C: Mall:** Malls are not mentioned as nightlife options in the passage.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, Uttor New Mexicote, ekjon darshanarthi kothay bikkhyato binodoner ayojon khunje pete paare?","The correct answer is **A: Albuquerque theke dui ghontar durottwe kono casinote** (At a casino within two hours of Albuquerque).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""upore bornito sob casinogulii paniyo poribeshon korey ebong taader modhye besh koyekti brand binodoner naame niye aashe (bishesh korey Albuquerque ebong Santa Fe er ashepasher boroguli)."" This translates to: ""All the casinos mentioned above offer drinks and many brands bring entertainment in their name (especially in the larger ones around Albuquerque and Santa Fe).""

This directly indicates casinos near Albuquerque and Santa Fe are where you'll find entertainment options. The passage *specifically cautions against* spending extended time in the smaller towns.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: kono durer pueblo te (in a distant pueblo)** - The passage says pueblos generally *lack* nightlife and aren't good for long stays.
*   **C: Sante Fe-er kachakachi kono casinote (at a casino near Santa Fe)** - While casinos around Santa Fe are mentioned, the passage highlights areas *around* Albuquerque specifically for entertainment.
*   **D: kono choto-town bare (in any small town)** - The passage explicitly warns against small towns for tourists seeking entertainment."
Budget socheton bhromonkarira kon dhoroner paniyo eriye jete chan?,"The correct answer is **B: Botoler jol**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sthaniya kaler paniti paan korar jonno puropuri nirapad, kintu aapni jodi bheeto hon tobe **botoljat paani sahojei khunje pawa jaay**."" (Local water is completely safe to drink, but if you are afraid, **bottled water is easily found**.)

This directly indicates that bottled water is a good option for budget-conscious travelers who are concerned about water safety. The other options are either more expensive (Australian wine, Pholer ros) or not specifically highlighted as a budget-friendly choice (Sthaniyo beer).
"
"Onuchchhede bornito elakar bhittite, nicher kon paniyoti order korle ekjon poribeshok bibhranto bodh korte paare?","The correct answer is **D: Ekti Flat White**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Australiander kachhe 'Flat White' coffee holo boideshik jinis."" (For Australians, 'Flat White' coffee is a foreign thing). 

This means ordering a Flat White in Australia would be unexpected and might cause confusion, as it's not considered a local drink there.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ekti short black:** The text mentions ""chhoto kaalo ronger 'Espresso'"" which is similar to a short black. It doesn't indicate it would cause confusion.
*   **B: Ekti Number One:** This is a local beer, so ordering it wouldn't be strange.
*   **C: New Zealand-er Sauvignon Blanc:** The text specifically says New Zealand wines (""Newjealand ebong Australian modgulo aaro valo cholbe"") are good and wouldn't be out of place.



"
"Tin shotabdi dhore, kon goshthir madhyome uponibesher suchona hoyechhilo?","The correct answer is **D: Spaniard**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Speniyora ouponibeshik kaaler suchona korey jaa tinn shatabdi dhorey sthai chhilo."" This directly translates to ""The Spanish colonial period indicated that it remained for three centuries.""

Therefore, the Spanish (Spaniard) were the ones who indicated/established the colonial period for three centuries.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, ekjon Py-arisian ke apnar samne sahoj, sabolil korar sera upay ti ki?","The passage states that Parisians are perceived as arrogant, impolite and pretentious. However, it suggests that behaving with ""bienveillance"" (polite manners) can help when approaching them, and that showing common courtesy will be reciprocated. 

Therefore, the best approach to make a Parisian feel comfortable and open up to you is **C: Nomro byabohar kora** (Using polite manners/etiquette).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pyarisian monobhab onukoron korar cheshta (Trying to imitate Parisian behavior):** The passage *implies* Parisians are often perceived negatively, so imitating them might reinforce those stereotypes.
* **B: Atmobishwas jagiye tola (Boosting self-confidence):** While helpful in general, the passage specifically focuses on how to *approach* Parisians, not on internal feelings.
* **D: Bohirmukhi achoron prodorshon kora (Showing outgoing behavior):**  Outgoing behavior might be misconstrued given the initial perception of Parisians as reserved.  Polite manners are a more universally understood approach.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, nicher kontike Pyarisiander stereotypical boishishtyo hisabe bibechona kora hoy na?","The passage states Pyarisians are known for being arrogant, improper, and pretentious. It also suggests behaving with ""bienveillance"" (civility) can help when approaching them. 

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: Ouddhotyo (Arrogance)** - The passage *explicitly* mentions arrogance as a stereotype.
* **B: Rukkhota (Rudeness/Harshness)** - The passage uses ""abadra"" which implies impropriety and can be linked to rudeness.
* **C: Aamude (Moodiness)** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Akosmik aachoron (Unpredictable behavior)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about unpredictable behavior.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Aamude**.  The passage doesn't stereotype Pyarisians as being moody.



"
Cape Town er metroreler prothom shrenir subidha ki?,"The correct answer is **B: Khub beshi lokjon thake na** (Not very crowded).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Metroplus adhik aramdayak ebong **kom jonakirno** tobe kichuta beshi byabahul..."" which translates to ""Metroplus is more comfortable and **less crowded** but a little more frequent...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Coach trainer samne thake** (Coach is in front of the train) - While true, this is a characteristic of *both* Metroplus and Metro, not a specific benefit of first class.
*   **C: Eti tritiyo shrenir ticketer tulonay kom byabahul** (It is less used than third-class tickets) - The text says it's *more* frequently used, not less.
*   **D: Etir mulyo Metro ticketer soman** (Its price is the same as Metro tickets) - The text explicitly says it's *cheaper* than European metros and implies it is more expensive than standard Metro tickets.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, Cape Town er protiti jatribahi traine ki achhe?","The correct answer is **D: Prothom ebong tritiya shrenir coach dutoie**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Protiti trainer Metroplus ebong Metro coach ubhayi royeche"" which translates to ""Every train has both Metroplus and Metro coaches"". Metroplus is the first class (prothom shreni) and Metro is the third class (tritiya shreni).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ekti kom bhirpurno Metro coach** - The passage doesn't mention how full the coaches are.
*   **B: Ubhoy shrenir jonno ticketer eki mulyo** - The passage states Metroplus is more expensive.
*   **C: Tinti alada alada shreni** - The passage only mentions two classes: Metroplus and Metro.



"
Kono prani ba kitpatanga nicher konti korar sombhabona nei?,"The correct answer is **A: Fuskuri srishti kora (Creating blisters)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) focuses on the dangers of insects (like mosquitoes) and pests:** It states they commonly don't show their presence, cause discomfort, spread allergies, or carry infections. It specifically mentions infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can harm or kill humans, but these are *not* typically considered pests.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Allergyr probhab briddhi (Increasing allergy effects):** The passage explicitly states pests can *create* allergies.
* **C: sankraman chhaarano (Spreading infection):** The passage explicitly states pests can *spread* infections.
* **D: Dhastadhostir somoy aaghat kora (Causing harm during discomfort/illness):** While pests *can* exacerbate discomfort, the passage highlights their ability to cause harm in general, not just when someone is already ill.

**Fuskuri srishti kora (Creating blisters)** is not mentioned in the passage as something pests commonly do.  They might cause itching or irritation, but not specifically blisters. Therefore, it's the least likely action a pest would take.



"
Pri-paid phone card kotha thekey kena jay?,"The correct answer is **C: Kornar dokane**.

The passage states: ""Protiti konar dokane pri-paid phone cardguli..."" which translates to ""Pre-paid phone cards are available in every corner store..."" 

Therefore, corner stores are where you can buy pre-paid phone cards.
"
Kichhu carder aaro bhalo call rate kibhabe sulabhe paoya jaay?,"The correct answer is **A: Eguli kebol nirdishto kichhu deshe sahojlobhya** (These are easily available only in specific countries).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""kichhu abar nirdishto desher jonno subidhajanak call rate diye thaake"" (some offer advantageous call rates for specific countries). This directly answers the question of how to get better rates - by choosing cards geared towards certain destinations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Toll-free number diye** - Toll-free numbers are used to *access* the service, not to get better rates.
* **C: Konar dokane** - Convenience stores are where you *buy* the cards, not how you get better rates.
* **D: Pay phone byabohar kore ebong otirikto charge diye** - Pay phones are mentioned as a way to *use* the cards, but don't inherently offer better rates, and often have additional charges.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, Plitvice lakes uddantite nicher kon gachti kom dekha jay?","The correct answer is **A: Beach**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Plitvice Lake-er moto uddantite muloto **beach**, spross ebong far gacher ghono bon royechhe..."" (Plitvice Lakes have forests of root **beach**, spross and fir trees...). The question asks what is *less* seen in the elevated areas. Since the passage explicitly mentions ""beach"" as part of the forest composition in the elevated areas, it's the most logical answer.

The other options are mentioned *as being present* in the forests, not as being less common in the elevated parts."
Plitvice lakes uddantite nicher kon birol prani dekha jay?,"The correct answer is **D: Caperellir**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Onek sadharan projatir pashapashi Europiyo Badami bhalouk, Nekre, Eagle, Pencha, Lings, Bonno Biraal ebong **Caperellir** moto biraal praniguli pawa jay"" (Many common animal species like European Brown Bear, Lynx, Eagle, Owl, Foxes, Forest Cat and **Caperellir** cats can be found).

The other options are not mentioned in the text.
"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, anchalik code asole ki korte sahajyo kore?","The correct answer is **A: Disk nakal kora (Disk copying)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...beaaini nokoler khettre anchalik codegulor sampurnobhabei kono probhabi nei; ekti disker prottek bit prottek biter jonno hubahu nakal thikbhabe cholbe...""  This translates to ""...regional codes have absolutely no effect in the field of illegal copying; every bit of a disk will be copied exactly bit-for-bit...""

This clearly indicates that regional codes *facilitate* disk copying, not prevent it.  The passage then goes on to say the *true* purpose of these organizations is market control (Bajar niyontron). While that's true, the question asks what the regional codes *themselves* help with.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bajar niyontron (Market control)** - This is the *organization's* goal, not what the codes *do*.
*   **C: Dosyuta protirodh (Piracy prevention)** - The passage explicitly says the codes have no effect on illegal copying.
*   **D: Beaini nakal kora (Illegal copying)** - This is too broad. The passage specifies it's about disk copying.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, nicher konti media company kortrik anchol code dhore raakha somporke mithya bole?","The correct answer is **A: Eguli aaro bajar niyontron laaver jonyo proyojoniyo** (These are necessary to gain more market control).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Asol uddeshya holo ei sansthaguloke taader bajare aaro niyontron deoa; egulo sobi ortho laaver bishoy."" (The real purpose is to give these organizations more control over their markets; these are all about economic gain.)

The passage explicitly says the stated purpose (""Grosthoswottapohoron rodh"" - preventing piracy) is a lie and the real aim is market dominance. Option A directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Eguli beaini nakal kora erate sahajyo kore** (These help in easily copying illegally) - The passage states there's *no* possibility of variation in copies; they are perfect replicas, making illegal copying easy already. The codes don't *help* with this, they're irrelevant to it.
* **C: Eguli orther aabortoner jonyo proyojoniyo** (These are necessary for economic ruin) - The passage indicates the codes benefit the companies, not cause economic ruin.
* **D: Eguli dosyuta protirodhe khubi kom sahajyo kore** (These provide very little help in preventing piracy) -  The passage explicitly states the ""anti-piracy"" claim is false.  However, Option A gets to the *reason* why the claim is false - it's about control, not prevention.



"
"Apnar nij deshe jaoar somoy, kon prokriya ti sadharonoto anushthanik hoi na?","The correct answer is **A: Immigration check**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states that immigration checks are generally *not* present or are only minimal when returning to one's own country. The other options (Itemer ghoshona - declaration of items, Itemer aaini seemaboddhota - legal limits of items, and Customs niyontron - customs control) are all things that *can* be problems or require attention when returning home.

Therefore, the process that is generally *not* practiced when returning to one's own country is the immigration check.



"
Apnar nij deshe pouchanor aage apnar nicher konti jana uchit?,"The most appropriate answer is **D: aapnar niye aasha kono item onumodito ki na** (Whether any item you are bringing is permitted).

Here's why:

* **The prompt (P) highlights potential issues with customs control and what you're allowed to bring.** It specifically mentions knowing what you *can* and *cannot* bring inside.
* **Option D directly addresses this concern.** Knowing if your items are permitted is crucial to avoid problems with customs.

Let's look at why the other options are less relevant:

* **A: Sekhane kono immigration check thakbe ki na** (Whether there will be immigration check) - The prompt states immigration checks are often absent or minimal, so this isn't the primary concern.
* **B: Aainee seemer baire aapnar kichhu ghoshana korte hobe ki na** (Whether you need to declare anything outside legal limits) - While related to customs, knowing *what* is allowed is more fundamental than knowing about declarations.  You need to know *if* something needs declaring first.
* **C: Sekhane custom niyantran thakbe ki na** (Whether there will be customs control) -  The prompt *expects* customs control to be a possibility, so knowing if it exists isn't the key information needed.



Therefore, **D** is the most direct and important piece of information to know before returning to your home country, as highlighted in the prompt."
"Onuchchhed onujayee, kiser prachurjota arohider Cochamó Valley-er modhye dharabahikvabe notun route abishkar korar sujog daay?","The correct answer is **D: Deyal** (Walls).

Here's why:

* **P** describes Cocamo as famous for its *granite walls* (granaiter boro prachir) and a prime location for rock climbing. The passage also mentions the continuous creation of *new routes* (notun notun path) on these walls.
* **Q** asks what facilitates the discovery of new routes *within* Cocamo Valley. 

Therefore, the abundance of **walls (Deyal)** is what allows for the continuous creation of new climbing routes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Drishyao (Views):** While the views are beautiful, they don't *create* the opportunity for new routes.
* **B: Churha (Peaks):** Peaks are climbed, but the passage focuses on the *faces* or walls of the mountains.
* **C: Shikhor (Summit):** Similar to peaks, the summit is the *goal* of a climb, not what enables new route development.



"
"Onuchchhede prodotto tathya onujayee, Southern Hemisphere-er sobcheye beshi crossing k cover kore?","The correct answer is **B: Star maitrisangathan**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Star Alliance covers everything from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, including all three Southern Hemisphere oceanic regions (implicitly meaning it covers the most of the Southern Hemisphere). While Skytim is mentioned as *not* going to all three oceanic regions, Star Alliance is specifically described as encompassing them all within its Latin American route.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Skytim:** The text explicitly states Skytim doesn't fly to all three Southern Hemisphere oceanic regions.
*   **C: Dakkhin Pacific:** Dakkhin Pacific (South Pacific) is a geographic region, not an airline or alliance.
*   **D: LATAM Oneworld:** While LATAM operates in the region, the passage highlights *Star Alliance* as having the most comprehensive coverage.



"
Kon eirline alliance Southern Hemisphere-e sorbonimno poriman somudro otikrom kore?,"The correct answer is **A: Star Maitrisangathan**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Tobe star maitrisangathan dakkhin-purbo proshanto mahasagariya Santiago de Chile thekey Tahiti porjonto baad diye samasta kichui antarbhukta korey, jeti holo Latin-American ekdaager seemana."" This translates to ""However, the Star Alliance covers everything from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti via the southeastern Pacific Ocean, which is the boundary of Latin American one-world.""

This means Star Alliance is the only alliance mentioned that operates across the southern hemisphere's oceanic routes. The other options are either geographical locations or alliances that don't cover the specified routes."
Kon tour sangstha Global Running Tours arjon korechhe?,"The correct answer is **B: Go Running Tours**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Goo running tours network, global running tourer uttarsuri..."" which translates to ""Go Running Tours network, successor to Global Running Tours..."".  This clearly indicates that Go Running Tours acquired Global Running Tours.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, Goo running Tour kototi bhinno bhinno chalman  sansthak songjukto korte sahajyo kore?","The correct answer is **C: Ek dajon** (meaning ""a dozen"" or around 12).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Goo running tours network, global running tourer uttarsuri, **charti mahadeshe koyek dojen dorsoniyosthaner poridorshon sarabrah korey**.""  This translates to ""Goo running tours network, successor to global running tour, *coordinates tours of several dozen sightseeing spots in four countries*.""

""Koyek dojen"" means ""a few dozen,"" which is approximately 12. Therefore, Goo running tours coordinates with around a dozen tour organizations.



"
"Kono porjotok khub sposhtobhabe chitak dekhte chaiele, taak ki korte hobe?","The correct answer is **C: Binocular byabohar kora (Using binoculars)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Singho, Chitta ebong Chitabagh kokhono kokhono lajuk hoy ebong aapni taader **durbin diyei beshi valo dekhte paben**."" (Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will be able to see them **better with binoculars**).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hiking safari:** While a hiking safari gets you closer to nature, the text doesn't suggest it's *specifically* for seeing shy animals like cheetahs.
*   **B: Jongole hatte jaoya (Going into the jungle):** Too general and doesn't address the challenge of seeing shy animals.
*   **D: Gaari neoya ebong standard soronjam byabohar kora (Taking a car and using standard equipment):** The text mentions cars help see elephants and giraffes, but not shy predators.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, janbahone chore safari bhromoner somoy darshanarthi kon dhoroner pranik samnasamni dekhte paare?","The correct answer is **B: Jiraf**.

This translates to: ""some animals, such as elephants and **giraffes**, can be seen very closely in the fields, and specific equipment will help to see them well.""

While the passage mentions lions, cheetahs, and leopards, it states they are often shy and best viewed with binoculars.  It *specifically* says giraffes (and elephants) can be seen up close.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, ki ekti tourer kharch kamabe?","The correct answer is **B: Chaarjoner ekti doll khuje ber kora**.

The passage states: ""apekkhakrito boro dole bhromoner jonno tourguli sosta...taai ekaa athoba ekjon bandhur saathe bhromonkalin john proti kom kharche ghorar jonno chaar thekey chhayjoner ekti doll gathon korun.""  This translates to: ""Tours for larger groups are cheaper...therefore, to reduce the cost per person during travel, find a group of four to six people to share a doll (presumably meaning a room/accommodation).""

Therefore, finding a group to share accommodation (a ""doll"" in this context) is presented as a way to reduce tour costs.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, kara tourer sera rate laabh korte paare?","The passage states that tours are cheaper when traveling alone or with a friend, and suggests forming a group of 4-6 people to share the cost of accommodation. It also implies that tour operators encourage people to spend more money.

Based on this, the people who benefit the most from the ""best rate"" (likely meaning the lowest cost) are those willing to share transport amongst themselves. This aligns with forming a group to split accommodation costs.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Paanchjoner dol (A group of five)**.  A larger group within the 4-6 person range would maximize the cost-sharing benefits mentioned in the passage.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, San Francisco-er bishwobyapi sunamer pechhone konti abodan rekhechhe?","The correct answer is **C: Orthonoitik boichitro (Economic diversity)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Syana Francisco'er arthaniti bichitro, jodio tha joriye aache taar biswa-maaner porjoton akarshan howaa niye."" (San Francisco's economic diversity, along with its beautiful scenery, is attracting worldwide tourism).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shilpo ebong mediaer bibhinno dhorone niyomito uposthiti (Regular presence of various arts and media):** While the passage mentions arts and culture, it doesn't present this as the *reason* for global fame. It says culture *helps* with recognition.
*   **B: Uchchomaner riti-neetor subidha (Luxury lifestyle facilities):** The passage mentions luxury, but again, as a part of the tourism infrastructure, not the core reason for San Francisco's global reputation.
*   **D: Asian khabarer anonnyo sombhar (Abundance of Asian food):** The passage highlights the quality of Asian cuisine in San Francisco, but it's presented as a benefit *within* the tourism experience, not the fundamental reason for its worldwide fame.

Therefore, the economic diversity mentioned at the very beginning of the passage is the most direct answer to the question of what lies behind San Francisco's global fame."
"Onuchchhed onujayee, San Francisco somporke nicher kon bibriti ti sotyi noy?","The correct answer is **D: Orthoniti sompurno-bhabe porjotoner upore nirbhorsheel** (The economy is completely dependent on tourism).

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Sobtheke beshi kormoniyoger bibhagguli holo peshadar porisheba, sarkari, artho, banijya ebong porjoton."" (The most employment-generating sectors are professional services, government, finance, commerce, and tourism.) This indicates that while tourism is a significant part of the economy, it's *not* the only or completely dominant factor. Other sectors like finance, government, and commerce are also major employers.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

*   **A: Etik prayoshoi chhayachobi o boie tule dhora hoyechhe** (It has been extensively photographed and filmed) - The passage states: ""Sangeet, chhayachobi, sahitya ebong janapriya sanskritite er kromagoto bornona shaharti ebong er porichito sthansamuho bishwajure porichitiprapto hote sahajyo korche."" (The sequential depiction in music, photography, literature and popular culture is helping the city and its familiar locations become known worldwide.)
*   **B: Asian khabarer procholon royechhe** (Asian cuisine is prevalent) - The passage explicitly states: ""Anyanno Asian khabar jemon: Korean, Thai, Bharatiya ebong Japani prabhritir jonno San Franciscoo rashtratir onnotomo sera jayga."" (San Francisco is one of the best places in the country for various Asian cuisines like Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese, etc.)
*   **C: Asankhya hotel ebong convention center royechhe** (There are countless hotels and convention centers) - The passage states: ""San Francisco asankhya hotel, restaura ebong uchchomaner ritinitir subidhajukto ekti bishal porjoton porikathamo gore tuleche."" (San Francisco has built a large tourism infrastructure with countless hotels, restaurants and high-end amenities.)

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""যদি সময় প্রয়োজন হয় তবে তারা আপনার জন্য reservation ধরে রাখতে পারেন যে কোনো সংশোধন বা অনুরোধের জন্য সাধারণভাবে হোটেলের সাথে যোগাযোগ না করে আগে ট্রাভেল এজেন্টের সাথে কথা বলা উচিত।"" (If time is needed, they can hold the reservation for you, and it is advisable to talk to the travel agent before contacting the hotel directly for any modifications or requests.)

This implies that if a traveler's visa is uncertain, they should discuss it with the travel agent *before* making a reservation, so the agent can advise and potentially hold the booking until the visa situation is clear.  A traveler with an uncertain visa is the type who would most benefit from the travel agent's assistance in this regard.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Siddhanto-heenotay thaka bhromonkari (Traveler lacking in decision making):** The travel agent can assist with decisions, but this doesn't mean they *need* to use the agent's services.
*   **B: Swotosfurtotar pokkhopati bhromonkari (Spontaneous traveler):** A spontaneous traveler might prefer to book independently, but could still use an agent. The passage doesn't say they wouldn't benefit.
*   **D: Je bhromonkari package deal book korte pochhondo kore (Traveler who prefers package deals):** Package deals are exactly what travel agents often offer, so they would *benefit* from using an agent.



"
Onuchchhede nicher kontik travel agenter madhyome book korar subidha hisabe ullekh kora hoyni?,"Correct answer is **A: Bhromon kagojpotrer drutota (Speed of travel documents)**.

Here's why:

The passage mentions the following benefits of booking through a travel agent:

*   **Accommodation assurance:** Knowing there will be a place to stay upon arrival.
*   **Variety of options:** Booking hotels and even camping grounds.
*   **Package deals:** Breakfast included, flight and hotel packages, transport arrangements.
*   **Reservation holding:** Agents can hold reservations while you gather documents (like visas) and handle modifications.
*   **Convenience:** Avoiding direct communication with hotels for changes.

The passage does *not* mention anything about travel agents speeding up the process of obtaining travel documents. Therefore, ""Bhromon kagojpotrer drutota"" is the only option not listed as a benefit."

Here's why:

The passage states, ""...tobey kichhu kheyal rakha darkar, kaaron taaraa ekhono sob bhul peyee thakte paare."" ( ""...but some care is needed because they can still make mistakes.""). This directly indicates that real-time text translation applications are *not* always accurate and can still contain errors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bideshi bhashay chinno anubad kora (Translating symbols in foreign languages):** The passage *highlights* this as a capability of these apps.
*   **B: Pathyer sob segment anubad kora (Translating all segments of text):**  The passage states the apps translate ""akkharer sampurna ongshogulo"" (complete parts of letters/text) which means they do translate all segments.
*   **C: Smartphone er madhyome bostu bishoyok text anubad kora (Translating text about objects using a smartphone):** The passage also mentions this as a feature.



"
Konti offline-e anubad korar sujog daay?,"The correct answer is **C: Bhashar upaytto dowaload kora** (Downloading language packs).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Google translate, jaa pochonder bhasar upaytto download korar pore offline anubader sujog daay"" - meaning Google Translate allows offline translation *after* downloading language packs. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Unnoto onubad engine** (Advanced translation engine) - While true that the engines are advanced, it doesn't explain *how* offline translation is possible.
* **B: Smartphone** - Smartphones are the *device* used, not the feature that enables offline translation.
* **D: real-time anubad bivager application** (Real-time translation apps) - The passage discusses this *type* of app, but doesn't say they all offer offline capabilities.



"
Nicher konti tusharpater trigger noi?,"The correct answer is **B: Manush**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Tusharpat (likely referring to a natural process or system) isn't affected by anomalies, and human existence is simply a natural occurrence within that system. It emphasizes natural events like the sun melting ice and then ice reforming.

Let's break down why the other options *are* triggers:

*   **A: Chitchite tushar (Scattered snow):** The passage explicitly states that melting snow (""baraf holo chitchite"") is a problem that requires intervention.
*   **C: Surjer aalo (Sunlight):** The passage directly mentions the sun melting ice as a fundamental natural event.
*   **D: Atirikto tusharpat (Excessive snow):** The passage discusses needing to manage melting snow and potentially redirect it to other areas, implying excessive snowfall is a factor.

Therefore, **Manush (Humans)** are presented as *part* of the natural world, not a trigger *for* Tusharpat. They exist *within* the system, but don't *cause* changes to it according to the text."
"Onuchchhed onujayee, nicher konti tusharpat hisabe neme ase?","The correct answer is **C: Khara ddhale atirikto tusharer poriman** (The amount of extra snow on the fields).

Here's why:

The passage states that the problem is the snow is melting quickly and needs to be replenished. It also mentions that some snow from one area can be used to replenish another. This implies that the ""neme"" (replenishment) refers to *adding* snow to areas where it's lacking, specifically the fields (""khara ddhal"") that can only hold a certain amount of snow.  The passage highlights the need to manage the *extra* snow to compensate for the melting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chitchite tushar jetik toka deoa hoyni** (Snow that hasn't been given to the patches) - The passage doesn't focus on patches but on the fields.
*   **B: Tushar chharha khara ddhal** (Fields covered in snow) - This describes a state, not the act of replenishing.
*   **D: Manusher chhowa payni emon tushar** (Snow that humans haven't touched) - This is irrelevant to the passage's discussion of snow management.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, Tarkari toirite ki ki upokaron byaborito hoy?","The correct answer is **B: Bheshoj o moshla** (Spices and herbs).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tarkari hachche bheshoj ebong moshlar saathe mangsho baa sabji."" which translates to ""Curry is made with spices and herbs with meat or vegetables.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Doi o jol (Yogurt and water)** - While yogurt (doi) is mentioned as used in North India and Pakistan, it's not a universal ingredient for *all* curries. Water isn't specifically mentioned.
*   **C: Narkel doodh ebong mangsho (Coconut milk and meat)** - Coconut milk is specifically mentioned as being used in South India and some coastal regions, not universally.
*   **D: Sobji ebong doodh (Vegetables and milk)** - Milk (doodh) is not mentioned in the passage as an ingredient.



"
"Kichhu nirdishto anchole, kokhono kokhono Tarkarite narkel doodhh kon upakaroner poriborte byabohar kora hoi?","The correct answer is **C: Doi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Uttor Bharat ebong Pakistane, doi sadharonoto torkarite byabohrito hoy; jekhane dakkhin Bharat ebong upomohadesher kichhu anyanno upokuliyo anchale sadharonoto, narkel doodh byabohrito hoy."" 

This translates to: ""In North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; whereas in South India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.""

This directly indicates that in certain regions, coconut milk is used *instead of* yogurt in curries (torkari).



"
Malbhumite uthar jonno Transantarctic porbotmalar passh ghure jete hobe keno?,"The correct answer is **B: Sangkhipto tushar bipojjonok** (Condensed snow is dangerous).

Here's why:

The passage states the South Pole Traverse is ""sangkhipto tushar jaa cravase bhora ebong potaka dwara chinnito"" (a short snowfield filled with crevasses and marked by stakes).  It also says ""Egulite sahoje jaoa jaay naa"" (It's not easy to go through them).  Therefore, the detour around the Transantarctic Mountains to reach Malbhum is *because* the direct route across the snowfield is dangerous due to crevasses and difficult terrain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: McMurdo Station praye bondho thake** (McMurdo Station is often closed) - The passage doesn't mention McMurdo Station being closed as a reason for the detour.
* **C: Bisheshayito tractorguli drutogami noi** (The specialized tractors are not fast) - While the passage mentions special tractors, speed isn't given as the reason for taking the longer route.
* **D: Ros samudra diye bhromon korar cheye eti beshi sahoj** (It is easier than traveling by the Ross Sea) - The passage doesn't state this is easier, just that it's *necessary* due to the difficult snowfield.



"
"South Pole Traverse borabor, konti otaka dwara chinnito hoi?","The correct answer is **C: Tushar diye achchhadito himobaher cheer** (Ice crevasses covered by snow).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""eti sangkhipto tushar jaa cravase bhora ebong potaka dwara chinnito"" which translates to ""This route is a narrow snowfield filled with crevasses and **marked by stakes**."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: McMurdo Stationer trail** - The trail *leads to* McMurdo Station, it isn't marked *by* the station.
*   **B: Je tractor guli fuel niye jachchhe** - The tractors *use* the route, they don't mark it.
*   **D: paharer charpashe bipojjonok baank** - The passage mentions going *around* the mountains, not that the route is marked by dangerous slopes around them.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Parikalpana korar somoy mathay rakhben je dakkhin Africa nirapad holeo samasta protibeshi desh noy."" (Keep in mind while planning that South Africa is safe, but not all neighboring countries are).

The question asks what the passage *doesn't* mention as something tourists should be aware of. Options A, B, and D are all points *mentioned* in the passage. Only option C reflects a statement that is contradicted by the text – the passage warns about the instability of surrounding countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bibhinno deshe visar jonno alada alada royechhe** (Different countries have different visa requirements) - This is directly stated in the passage.
*   **B: Kaacha sarake thaaka sthaanguli ghure dekhar jonno gaarite bhromon ekti bhalo upay** (Car travel is a good way to explore places with unpaved roads) - This is implied by the focus on 4x4 vehicles and accessing remote areas.
*   **D: Gaarite bhromon korle 4x4 byaboharer poramorsho deoa hoy** (It is recommended to use a 4x4 vehicle for car travel) - This is a key point made in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the passage mentions required items, it doesn't frame it as bad advice.
*   **B:** The passage *recommends* 4x4 vehicles and states many places are only accessible with them, contradicting this option.
*   **C:** The passage highlights that venturing off main routes requires specific vehicles (4x4) and preparedness, implying it's not a good idea for everyone.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the dangers of unknowingly becoming a drug mule, facing severe legal consequences (imprisonment or death penalty), and potential security concerns (being mistaken for a bomb threat).** It explicitly mentions theft as a risk (""Nojore thaake naa emon bagguli sadharonoto churir jonno target koraa hoy"" - such bags are often targeted for theft) and the possibility of security checks with drug-sniffing dogs and bomb threat suspicions.
* **The passage *doesn't* mention the risk of your bag being accidentally switched with someone else's.** While it's a possible risk when traveling, it's not highlighted in the provided text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Seguli churi hoye jete pare (They could be stolen)** - The passage *does* mention theft.
* **B: Apni ojantei ekjon madok bahok hoye jete paren (You could unknowingly become a drug mule)** - This is the central warning of the passage.
* **D: Kotripokkho setike sombhabyo boma haamlar humki hisebe dekhte pare (Security might see it as a potential bomb threat)** - The passage mentions this possibility.

    * **C:** Drug-sniffing dogs can be used without prior notice.
    * **D:** You can be used as a drug mule unknowingly and your luggage can be searched.

* **The passage *does not* specifically advise taking extra precautions during international travel**, although it implies it by warning about crossing international borders. It focuses on the *consequences* of unknowingly carrying drugs, not preventative measures beyond keeping your belongings in sight.



Therefore, option B is the only statement *not* directly mentioned or implied in the text."
Baarite thaakar somoy kon dharoner paniyo toirir cheshta korar kotha ullekh kora hoyni?,"The correct answer is **C: Beer**.

The passage mentions preparing ""samriddha coffee"" (rich coffee) and ""Chamomile cha"" (Chamomile tea) at home. It also alludes to possibly finding a way to make ""sadamata paniyo"" (perhaps herbal drinks/infused water) when returning to a daily routine, and exploring bars/pubs for drinks if living in a city with a diverse beverage culture.

However, there's *no mention* of trying to make beer at home.  The focus is on coffee, tea, and potentially other soft beverages/herbal infusions.

Therefore:

*   **A: Juice** - While not explicitly mentioned, it falls under the category of diverse beverages one might find in a city.
*   **B: Coffee** - Directly mentioned as something to prepare at home.
*   **D: Cha (Tea)** - Directly mentioned as something to prepare at home (Chamomile tea).
*   **C: Beer** -  Not mentioned at all in the passage."
Apnar shohor paniyor sangskritir jonyo suporichito hole barite thaakakalin somoye aapnar kothay jaoya uchit?,"The correct answer is **A: Apnar ashepasher bairer coffee shop (Your nearby coffee shop)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""Sokale ekti samriddha coffee ebong rate swachchondojukto Chamomile cha"" (Rich coffee in the morning and relaxing Chamomile tea at night) and suggests exploring local ""bar baa pubgulite ghono ghono jaan"" (bars or pubs) if you live in a city with a diverse beverage culture.  The passage connects coffee to the morning routine and suggests exploring local establishments. Therefore, a nearby coffee shop is the most logical place to go.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Juice ba smoothier dokan (Juice or smoothie shop):** While part of a beverage culture, it doesn't directly align with the passage's focus on coffee and tea.
* **C: Emon kono Pub jekhane aapni khub beshi jan na (A pub where you don't know many people):** The passage encourages *exploring* pubs, not avoiding socializing.
* **D: Chamomile cha toiri kore emon restaurant (A restaurant that makes Chamomile tea):**  The passage suggests making chamomile tea *yourself* at night, not necessarily going to a restaurant for it.



"
Payrar bhaskorjo kothay obosthito?,"The correct answer is **A: Gram theke aadh ghontar poth dure** (Half an hour's walk from the village).

Here's why:

The text states ""Samadhikkhetre, koyekti samadhir upore payrar chitre akarshaniya marble bhaskorjo royechhe."" (In the cemetery, there are attractive marble sculptures of pigeons on several graves). It also says ""Kautuhal uddipok gramti bhromon korte aadh ghanta somoy laage."" (It takes half an hour to take an interesting walk around the village).  This implies the cemetery (and therefore the sculptures) are reached within that half-hour walk *from the village*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Girjar prangone** - The text doesn't mention the sculptures being *on* the church grounds.
*   **C: Eysturoy dweepe** - While the village is *on* Eysturoy island, that's too broad a location. The question asks for a specific location *relative to the village*.
*   **D: Girjar modhye** - The text doesn't indicate the sculptures are inside the church.



"
Kon dharoner visar jonyo byaktik porjapto arthik sohayotar proman dite hobe?,"The correct answer is **D: Student visa**.

The text specifically states: ""Student visar sadharonoto sadharan porjotok baa byabasayik visa thekey vinnorayojaniyata ebong abedon poddhoti thaake. Beshirbhag dasher khettrei, apni je protisthane porashona korte chaan sei protisthaner ekti offer letter ebong aapnar course kompokkhe prothom bochore nijeke chaalaanor jonno arthik sompod promaner prayojan hobey.""

This translates to: ""Student visas are generally more complex than general tourist or business visas and require applications. In most countries, you will need an offer letter from the institution you want to study at and proof of financial resources to support yourself for at least the first year of your course.""

Therefore, a student visa requires proof of personal financial support.



"
Kar bordhito visar proyojon hote pare?,"The correct answer is **C: Ekjon antorjatik chhatro (An international student)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""antorjatik chhatro hisebe sekhane gele sadharan porjotoker tulonayy sadharonoto dirghomeyader jonno thakte hoy"" (as an international student, you usually stay for longer periods compared to a general tourist) and ""Student visar sadharonoto sadharan porjotok baa byabasayik visa thekey vinnorayojaniyata ebong abedon poddhoti thaake"" (Student visas are generally more suitable and require an application compared to general tourist or business visas).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ekjon niyomito porjotok (A regular tourist):** The text implies tourists may not *need* a visa for short trips.
*   **B: Ekjon obhiggo bhromonkari (A casual traveler):** This isn't specifically mentioned as requiring a long-term visa.
*   **D: Ekjon byabsayik bhromonkari (A business traveler):** The text states business visas are different from student visas, implying they might be sufficient for business trips."
Kakhon apnak moshar byapare bisheshvabe socheton hote hobe?,"The correct answer is **D: Gaari chalanor somoye (While driving)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states you need to be especially careful about flies while driving, particularly in areas with heavy rain (""Grissomondoliya ghono brishtipater elakay gaari chalao""). It mentions leaving the car door open for a few moments to allow flies to escape. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Greeser maase (In the month of summer):** The passage doesn't mention anything about summer specifically.
* **B: Hike a (Hike a):** This option doesn't make sense in the context of the passage.
* **C: Brishti aronnye (Rainy forests):** While the passage mentions rain, it focuses on the danger *while driving* in rainy areas, not simply being in a rainy forest.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, Sundarban somporke nicher kon bibrititi sotyi noi?","The correct answer is **B: Er mot elakar ordhek jolabhumiite acchhadito**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Sundarbaner ayoton 3,850 borgo kilometre. Er ek-tritiyangsho elaka jolabhumi."" (Sundarban's area is 3,850 square kilometers. One-third of this area is water.)
*   One-third is *not* equivalent to half.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Eti koyekti oboshishto jangoler boishishto tule dhore** - The passage mentions Sundarban holds the remnants of forests that once covered the Gangetic plains (""luptapray jangaler shes ongshogulo jegulo eksamoy Gangeya somobhumike dheke rekhechilo"").
*   **C: Eti bishwer brihottomo mangrove bandhani** - The passage states, ""Sundarban bishwer sobtheke boro upokulborti mangrove bandhani"" (Sundarban is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest).
*   **D: Ekhane Royal Bengal bagher tulonay chitra horin behi baas kore** - The passage says there are approximately 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 chitra deer (""pray 30,000 chitra horin""). This indicates a significantly higher deer population.



"
Boner kon ongshoti  bharatiya bhukhander  modhye obosthito?,"The correct answer is **A: Sundarban jatiya uddan**.

The passage specifically states: ""Bharatiya bhukhander modhye thaka boner ongshotike Sundarban jatiya uddan bola hoy."" (The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarban National Park.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bonyopranir obhoyaronyo (Wildlife Sanctuary):** While Sundarban *is* a wildlife sanctuary, the question asks which part of the forest is within Indian territory, not what kind of protected area it is.
* **C: World Heritage Site:** This is a designation, not a physical part of the forest.
* **D: Gangetic somobhumi (Gangetic plains):** The passage mentions the forest *used to be* part of the Gangetic plains, but doesn't state it's currently located there.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, kar ingreji bhasha bojhar moto simito sombhabona holeo royechhe?","The correct answer is **B: Komboyeshi lokera** (A large number of people).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...and in many places, especially among smaller business owners, you can expect to find a limited knowledge [of English]."" This directly implies that a significant number of people (komboyeshi lokera) might have limited English comprehension.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Je byaktira kompokkhe aaro duti bhasha bolte paren** (The person who speaks more than two languages): The passage doesn't mention anything about people who are multilingual.
*   **C: Torronto te bhromone jaoya lokjon** (People visiting Toronto): The passage doesn't say visitors have limited English. It speaks about people *in* certain places, not *visiting* those places.
*   **D: Boyosko lokjon** (Older people): The passage doesn't focus on age as a factor in English comprehension.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, konti uchcharon kora kothin hote pare?","The correct answer is **D: Sthaniyo galagal (Local dialects)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*Echharao uchcharito shobdo thekey likhito shobdo bojha prai sahaj, etaa biseshoto sotti thikanagulir khettre, jeguli bodhgamyarupe uchcharon koraa prai kathin.*"" 

This translates to: ""Even though spoken words are relatively easy to understand from written words, especially in real locations where it is difficult to pronounce in an understandable way.""

The example of the Mancunian, Bostonian, Jamaican, and Sydney-sider highlights how different accents and local ways of speaking (dialects) can make understanding each other challenging.  The passage specifically points out the difficulty in *pronouncing* in a way that's universally understood when dealing with regional variations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: swotontro uchcharone bola shobdo (Independently pronounced words):** The passage doesn't focus on difficulty with individual word pronunciation, but rather on the variations caused by location.
*   **B: Thikana (Location):** While the passage mentions locations, the difficulty isn't *with* the locations themselves, but with the language used *within* those locations.
*   **C: Likhito shobdo (Written words):** The passage states that understanding written words is *easier* than understanding spoken words, making this the opposite of the question."
"Onuchchhed onujayee, antojela station theke buse jete porikolpona korchhen emon bhromonkarir jonyo kon drishyoti adorsho hobe?","The correct answer is **D: Bhromonkari purber dike jachchhen ebong 6:20 er aage statione pouchhan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...jeguli purbodike ebong jakar/Bumthong ee jay seguli 06:30 thekey 07:30 tar modhye chhare."" (Those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang depart between 6:30 and 7:30).
* **Option D** directly reflects this information – traveling east (""purber dike"") and needing to arrive *before* 6:30 to catch the bus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  While Jakar is mentioned, the passage doesn't specify anything about already having a ticket.
* **B:** The passage states buses to Bumthang leave between 6:30-7:30, not that one *must* depart by 7:00.
* **C:** Paro and Punakha are mentioned as destinations for taxis, *not* buses from Antojela station. Also, needing to depart by 11:00 isn't relevant to the bus schedule.



"
Antojela bus station theke purbo dike bhromone jete chan emon ekjon porjotoker jonno ekti bhalo poramorsho ki hobe?,"The correct answer is **D: Ekti share kora taxi bhromoner sob cheye smart madhyom hote pare** (Sharing a taxi could be the smartest way to travel).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bhagabhagi korey bhromon koraa jay emon taxigulo Parro (NU 150) ebong Punakha (NU 200) er moto kachher jaigagulote bhromon korar jonno ekti druta ebong aramdayok upayy."" (Taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Parro and Punakha).  It specifically highlights taxis as efficient for short trips.
* **The question asks about traveling *east* from Antojela bus station.**  The passage mentions Parro and Punakha as destinations reachable by taxi, and those are likely east of the bus station.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bus shudhumatro 8:30 er pore chhare** (Buses only leave after 8:30) - This is false. The passage states buses leave between 6:30 and 7:30 *and* encourages buying tickets in advance because they fill up.
* **B: Ogrim ticket kinun** (Buy an early ticket) - While the passage suggests buying tickets in advance, it doesn't make this a *good recommendation* for someone specifically wanting to travel *east*.
* **C: Saradine onek guli bus chharhe** (Many buses leave throughout the day) - The passage focuses on the early morning rush (6:30-7:30) and doesn't guarantee frequent departures all day.



"
Nicher konti Timbuktu-er sothik biboron noi?,"Correct answer is **C: Ekhane bimaner sahajye access paoya jayna**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Timbaktu ekti daridra desh, jodio jonopriyotar karone ety ekti akarshaniya porjoton kendra **ebong er ekti bimanbandaro royechhe**."" (Timbuktu is a poor country, but due to its popularity it remains an attractive tourist destination **and has an airport**.)

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

*   **A: Desher baki angsher tulonay ekhane Arobi-r pravab beshi** - The text says: ""Ei shaharti desher anyanno shohorer thekey ekebarei biporit, kaaron ekhankar poribeshe Africar poriborte Araber pravabi beshi."" (Unlike other cities in this desert country, the environment here is more influenced by Arabs than Africa.)
*   **B: Eti daridra pirito** - The text starts with ""Timbuktu etir apekkhik durgomotar saathe ekotrito hoye bohiragoto, durborti anchaler olongkar hisabe byabohrito hoyeche."" (Timbuktu has been associated with relative hardship and has been used as an ornament of poor areas.) and also says ""Aaj, Timbaktu ekti daridra desh..."" (Today, Timbuktu is a poor country...)
*   **D: Eti koutuholi bhromonkarider jonno ekti akorshon hisabe roye gechhe** - The text says: ""jodio jonopriyotar karone ety ekti akarshaniya porjoton kendra..."" (but due to its popularity it remains an attractive tourist destination...)

Therefore, the only incorrect statement is that Timbuktu doesn't have airport access."
Timbuktu somporke nicher kon tathyoti sotyi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ashepasher shohor gulir tulonay etite African swabhab kom dekha jaay** (Compared to the surrounding cities, less African nature is seen here).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Ei shaharti desher anyanno shohorer thekey ekebarei biporit, kaaron ekhankar poribeshe Africar poriborte Araber pravabi beshi."" which translates to ""This city is very different from other cities, because the influence of Arabs is more here than that of Africa.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shohortithe Bimane kore pownchhano sombhob** (It is possible to reach the city by plane) - While the text *mentions* Timbuktu has an airport, it doesn't emphasize it as a key fact.
* **B: Eti daridrar cheye beshi odbhut** (It is more wonderful than poor) - The text explicitly states Timbuktu is a ""daridra desh"" (poor country).
* **D: Shohorti ar porjotokder akarshan kore na** (The city does not attract cities and tourists) - The text says it *is* a popular tourist destination (""jonopriyotar karone ety ekti akarshaniya porjoton kendra"").

The text states: ""2021 saaler 24 August thekey 5 September porjonto paralympic onusthito hobey."" (Paralympic will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021). While it doesn't directly mention the *original* date of the Summer Olympics, it implies the event was rescheduled to August 2021. The text also references July 2020 as when the question of holding the Olympics remained, suggesting the original plan was for 2020 but was delayed."
"Onuchchhed onujayee, kon somoye ekti funnel tornado te porinoto hoi?","The correct answer is **D: Mati sporsho korar pore** (After touching the ground).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""jokhon sei megh maati sporsho korey tokhon """"""""Tornado""""""""-tee porinoto hoy."" which translates to ""when that cloud touches the ground, then it is known as a """"""""Tornado"""""""".""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jakhon batas proti ghantay pray 100 mile pouchhay** (When the wind reaches about 100 miles per hour) - While strong winds are *associated* with tornadoes, the passage says a funnel becomes a tornado *after* ground contact, not just at a certain wind speed.
*   **B: Jakhon bataser column guli ghurte shuru kore** (When the columns of air start rotating) - Rotation is a part of the formation, but not the defining moment it *becomes* a tornado.
*   **C: Jhorher megh theke namar somoy** (While descending from the rain cloud) - The funnel starts forming from the cloud, but isn't a tornado until it touches the ground.



"
Eigulir modhye konti tornadoer ekti sothik boishishtyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Seguli prayashoi bhari jiniso batase uriye niye jete paare.** (They can lift and carry heavy objects.)

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""tornado joto egoy taa bhari jiniso batase uriye niye jete paare"" - which directly translates to ""tornadoes can lift and carry heavy objects.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eti sob somoy 100-200 mile proti ghantay batas toiri kore** (It always creates winds of 100-200 miles per hour) - The passage says ""prayashai 100-200 mile/ghanta"" which means *approximately* or *usually* 100-200 mph, not *always*.
* **C: Mati sporsho korar pore tara funel e porinoto hoi** (They become funnels after touching the ground) - The passage says they *start* as funnels and *then* touch the ground to *become* a tornado. It's not the touching that makes the funnel shape, the funnel shape exists before.
* **D: Seguli holo ghurnan stambha ja batas k bairer dike thele daay** (They are rotating columns that push air outwards) - The passage states they *pull* air inwards and upwards (""abhyantarin ebong urdhabhimukhi bhabe taaney"").

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Upodeshtaguli kabol ekti desher rajnaitik poristhitir sarsongkhep."" (Advisories are a summary of a country's political situation). It also mentions that the information presented in the advisories is quicker, more general, and oversimplified compared to detailed research.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Je deshti te tara bhromon korben sekhankar sarkar theke** (From the government of the country they are visiting): While a country's government *has* information, the passage implies the travel advisory itself is the source for a quick overview.
*   **C: Deshtir je shohore tara bhromon korben sekhankar nagorikder theke** (From the citizens of the city they are visiting): Citizens might have local knowledge, but the passage focuses on official advisories.
*   **D: Nijeder sarkarer kachh theke** (From their own government): The passage says you *can* seek help from your own government, but it doesn't suggest that's where you'd find information about the *destination's* political situation. It highlights that other governments' advice is geared towards *their* citizens.



"
"Ekti bhromon poramorsher evente, ekjon bideshi nagariker kon obhiggota howar sombhabona nei bollei chole?","The correct answer is **A: Provabito batil beema (Proven cancellation insurance)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that travel to a country experiencing unrest can affect your *travel cancellation insurance*. The passage warns that assistance from other governments might be limited as their advice is tailored for their own citizens.  This directly relates to the likelihood of being able to *claim* on cancellation insurance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Deshtir rajnoitik poristhiti somporke oti sorolikrito sarsongkkhep (Oversimplified summary of the country's political situation):** While the passage *mentions* oversimplification of political situations, it doesn't say this is something a traveler is unlikely to encounter.
* **C: Provabito swastho beema (Proven health insurance):** The passage mentions health insurance *being affected* but doesn't say a foreigner wouldn't be able to access it.
* **D: Deshtir rajnoitik poristhiti somporke bistarito tathya (Detailed information about the country's political situation):**  The passage states detailed information is *harder to get*, not that a foreigner won't encounter any information.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, kon dhoroner trip a bhromonobikretar kachh theke booking sohayotar proyojon howar somvabona sob theke kom?","The correct answer is **A: Bhromonkari aage poridorshon korechhen emon ekti shohore kono kaajer sommeloner trip.**

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agents are most helpful when dealing with:

*   The nature, culture, language of the traveler
*   Prior knowledge of lesser-known destinations
*   Specific types of travel, budgets, or destinations

A trip to a city the traveler has already researched for a work conference requires *none* of these. The traveler has likely already handled logistics and has prior knowledge of the destination. 

Let's look at why the other options are more likely to need an agent:

*   **B: Ekti nirdishto budgete dui soptaho byapi bhromon (A two-week trip on a specific budget):**  This requires an agent to find options within the budget.
*   **C: Ekti trip jekhane bhasha goto badha uposthapon kora horbe (A trip where language is a significant barrier):** This requires an agent with knowledge of destinations where language support is available.
*   **D: Ekjon bhromonkarir prothom bidesh bhromon (A first-time international trip):** This requires an agent to guide the traveler through unfamiliar processes and cultural differences.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, kon poristhitite ekjon bhromonkari ekjon bhromonobikretar sahajye sobcheye beshi upokrito hobe?","The correct answer is **B: Jakhan bhramankari prothom barer jonyo ekti bishesh bhromon booking korte agrohi hoi** (When the traveler is trying to book a special trip for the first time).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Many agents specialize in specific types of travel, budgets, or destinations."" and ""It is good to use agents who will tailor your travel to your needs.""  This directly relates to someone needing help with a *special* trip, especially if it's their *first* time booking such a trip. They would benefit from an agent's expertise in that specific area.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A:** Roundtrip flights are typically straightforward bookings that can be done easily online or through general booking sites. An agent isn’t necessarily needed.
*   **C:** The passage mentions agents being helpful with language barriers, but this isn't the *most* beneficial situation outlined.
*   **D:** While agents are knowledgeable about cultures, the passage suggests they are most helpful in *planning* the trip, not just understanding the destination.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Jokhon tumi bhromon korbe, tokhon sabkichu nijer barir moto korey protyasha korbe naa."" (When you travel, don't expect everything to be like your home).  Expecting things to be the same as where you're from is a setup for disappointment.  The passage advises being prepared for differences in customs, laws, etc.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oporichito khabar cheshta korar ichchha** (Willingness to try unfamiliar food) - This is *positive* and helpful for travel, not a way to avoid disappointment.
* **C: Tara jekhan theke esechhe sekhankar moto aain mene chola** (Trying to follow the laws of where they came from) - This is illogical and could get you into trouble.
* **D: Tader thakbar sthaner upore gobeshona na kora** (Not researching their accommodation) - This would *increase* the chances of disappointment.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that things will be *different* when traveling.** Different customs, laws, values, language, etc. are all mentioned.
* **A rigid-minded person (ekmukhi moner odhikari) will have difficulty accepting these differences.** They expect things to be like they are at home and will likely become frustrated when they aren't. The passage specifically warns about needing to be prepared for disappointment (""hatasha"") and to overlook potential dislikes (""aruchi"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Je bairer khabar pochhondo kore (Someone who likes outside food):**  This relates to food preferences, not a general disposition toward dealing with cultural differences.
* **B: Emon keu je poribortone unnoti labh kore (Someone who thrives on change):** This is the *opposite* of someone who would be disappointed; they would likely enjoy the new experiences.
* **D: Emon keu je shekha upobhog kore (Someone who enjoys learning):** Someone who enjoys learning would be open to new experiences and differences, making them less likely to be disappointed.

The text explicitly advises *against* going to places where you have no knowledge of the local wildlife (""Apni godi baa Pader opor emon jaygay ghumaben naa seey anchalguloy jaar sthaniya pranikul somporke aapnar gyaan nei.""). Option A directly contradicts this advice by suggesting you *should* learn about local wildlife before traveling.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with the text:

*   **B:** The text suggests being mindful of expenses, especially regarding Western-style comforts (""poschima dhancher ebong valo maaner hotel, khabar ebong porishebagulike abhyasta hote abadhe kharacher byapare bibechona korun""). So spending more on food initially is mentioned.
*   **C:** The text recommends bringing a camp bed or hammock to avoid snakes and scorpions when camping (""saap, bichchu ebong egulo thekey dure rakhte ekti camp khaat ba Hammock saathe anun"").
*   **D:** The text recommends choosing well-regarded hotels (""valo maaner hotel"")."

The passage explicitly states: ""Apni godi baa Pader opor emon jaygay ghumaben naa seey anchalguloy jaar sthaniya pranikul somporke aapnar gyaan nei. Apni jodi bere camp korte chan tobe saap, bichchu ebong egulo thekey dure rakhte ekti camp khaat ba Hammock saathe anun."" This means spending on a camp cot or hammock is *recommended* for safety while camping, not something to be avoided to save costs.

The passage advises being mindful of expenses related to:

*   **poschima dhancher khabar (Western food)**
*   **man-somponno porisheba (comfortable amenities)**
*   **valo maaner hotel (good standard hotels)**

These are all things the passage suggests considering the cost of when traveling in developing countries. Therefore, the question asks about what is *not* mentioned as an area where costs should be considered."

* **A: Bhromon songike ekti copy deoya (Giving a copy to a travel companion):**  This relies on someone else and isn't a guaranteed, personal, and readily accessible copy for the policyholder.
* **B: Taar nijederke ekti copy email kora (Emailing a copy to themselves):** The prompt anticipates a situation *without* internet access. Email is useless in that scenario.
* **D: “Cloud” e ekti copy sanrakkhan kora (“Cloud” saving a copy):**  Like email, cloud storage requires internet access, which the policyholder may not have.

Therefore, saving the copy on a laptop or tablet's memory is the only solution that directly addresses the need for a virtual copy *accessible without internet*.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, policyte nicher konti dekhanor proyojon nei?","The correct answer is **D: Policy holdarer email address**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the need to display the insurance company's email address and international phone number for claims and approvals. It doesn't mention needing the *policyholder's* email address.  The focus is on contact information for *reaching the insurance provider*.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dabi korar jonyo antorjatik phone number (International phone number for claims):** The passage clearly states this is needed.
* **B: Bimakarir email address (Insurance company's email address):**  The passage explicitly states this is needed.
* **C: Onumodoner jonyo antorjatik phone number (International phone number for approval):** The passage clearly states this is needed.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, kon negative akarti sadharonoto byabohrito film formatke protifolito kore?","The correct answer is **A: 6 x 6 cm negative**.

Here's why:

The passage states that some medium-format film cameras use a 6 x 6 centimeter measurement, and specifically mentions a 56 x 56 mm negative. It then directly compares this to the more common 35mm negative, stating the 6x6 (or 56x56mm) provides *about four times* the resolution.  This indicates it's the format that reflects a different, and larger, standard than the common 35mm.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 56 x 56 mm negative:** While mentioned in the text, it *represents* the 6x6 format, it isn't the broader format itself.
*   **C: 35 mm negative:** The passage states this is the *most* common format, not one that represents an alternative.
*   **D: 36 x 24 mm negative:** This is just the dimensions of the negative *within* the 35mm format, not a different format altogether.



"
Nicher kon film format DSLR er motoi resolution daay?,"The correct answer is **C: 56 x 56 mm film**.

Here's why:

The passage states that 35mm film, *if* fully utilized, would yield a clarity similar to a DSLR. However, it *also* states that a 56 x 56 mm negative offers approximately four times the resolution of a 35mm negative. This implies it's closer to DSLR quality than 35mm alone.  While 6x6 is larger, the passage specifically highlights the 56x56mm as being significantly better resolution than 35mm.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 35 mm film:** The passage says it *could* be similar to DSLR *if* fully utilized, but isn't inherently at that resolution.
*   **B: Medium format er film:**  This is a broader category that *includes* 6x6 and 56x56mm, but doesn't specifically pinpoint the one with the closest resolution.
*   **D: 6 x 6 cm film:** While offering high resolution, the passage specifically contrasts the 35mm with the *56x56mm* negative in terms of resolution difference. It doesn't directly compare 6x6 to DSLR quality."
"Onuchchhed onujayee, ekti Bhromon bishoyok lekhalekhir byabosa shuru korar shesh dhap konti hobe?","The correct answer is **C: Nijoswo website toiri kora** (Creating your own website).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""After gaining proficiency in web formatting and editing, you can create your own website."" This clearly indicates creating your own website is the *last* step mentioned in the process of starting a travel writing business, following learning web formatting and editing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Web formatting onushilon kora** (Learning web formatting) - This is a step *before* creating your own website.
* **B: Ekti swanam-dhonyo bhromon blog er jonyo besh koyekti nibondho lekha** (Writing several articles for a popular travel blog) - This is the *first* step mentioned.
* **D: Sompadonar dokkhota barano** (Increasing editing skills) -  This happens *alongside* learning web formatting, not as the final step.



"
"Bhromon bishoyok lekhalekhir byabosa shuru korar somoy, nicher dokkhota gulir konti prothomei porimarjon korte hote paare?","The correct answer is **A: Blogging**.

Here's why:

The passage states the easiest way to start a travel writing business is to **""barano (publish) aapnar dokkhota (your writing) ekti protisthito bhromon blog website-e""** - meaning to publish your writing on an established travel blog website.  This means *blogging* (writing and publishing content) is the first step.

The other options are subsequent steps:

* **B: Web formatting & C: Editing** come *after* you've started writing and are preparing to publish on a website.
* **D: Website toiri kora (Website creation)** is mentioned as something you do *after* gaining familiarity with web formats and editing.



"
Kon dhoroner jalbayute sadharonoto ontrer somosya dekha jay?,"The correct answer is **C: Garam jalbayute (Warm/Hot climates)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""ushno jalbayute bacteria jemon aro druta briddhi pay, temonyi shorirer bere dirghakal benche thaake."" This translates to ""Warm-climate bacteria, like those that grow more rapidly, also survive longer in the body.""  It then lists several illnesses (Delhi belly, etc.) as examples linked to this.

The passage also contrasts this with cold climates, stating that problems in cold climates are less dangerous. Therefore, warm/hot climates are the ones where intestinal problems are commonly seen."
"Onuchchhed onujayee, niyomito sommukhin howar pholey rog protirodh khamotar ki hote paare?","The correct answer is **B: Sthaniyo jibanur aakromon** (Local microbial invasion).

Here's why:

The passage states that while your existing immunity offers good protection against familiar bacteria, you're more susceptible to problems in areas with *new* bacteria.  This means a lack of pre-existing immunity leads to *invasion* by local microorganisms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ontrer somosya (Intestinal problems):** While the passage *mentions* intestinal problems like Delhi Belly as an example, it's a *result* of the invasion, not the fundamental reason for reduced resistance.
* **C: Shwas koshter somosya (Respiratory problems):** The passage doesn’t focus on respiratory issues.
* **D: Delhi Belly:** This is a specific example of a problem caused by the invasion, not the general reason for weakened resistance.



"
Nicher konti Schengen anchalti er modhye bhromoner ekti subidha?,"The correct answer is **B: Ortho sashraya kora (Saving money)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Sutorang somoy, ortho ebong kagojpotrer sashraya hobey"" which translates to ""Therefore, it will save time, money and paperwork."" This directly indicates that a benefit of the Schengen area is saving money.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ekadhik visa abedon eriye chola (Applying for multiple visas)** - The passage explicitly says you *don't* need to apply for separate visas for each Schengen country.
*   **C: Ekadhik passport niyantran checkpoint eriye chola (Crossing multiple passport control checkpoints)** - The passage states you *avoid* passport control checkpoints within the area.
*   **D: Kono passport er proyojon nei (No passport required)** - The passage states you still need a passport, just not checked at every border.



"
Tutenkhamener somadhite ar ki pawa jabe na?,"The correct answer is **D: Oishorjo (Wealth/Treasures)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Samadhir modhye thaka bipul dhansampad ekhon aar ete nei, taa Ceror Mishariya jadughare sariye deoa hoyeche."" This translates to ""The vast wealth that was inside the tomb is no longer there, it has been moved to the Cairo Museum.""

Therefore, you will no longer find treasures/wealth in Tutenkhamun's tomb.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kichhu sajsojja (Some decorations):** The passage mentions the tomb was *limitedly* decorated, and doesn't say decorations have been removed.
*   **B: Momir matha (The mummy's head):** The passage implies the mummy is still *in* the tomb, although viewing it is restricted.
*   **C: Momir kaandh (The mummy's shoulder):** Similar to the head, the passage says only the head and shoulders might be visible, so it's still present."
"Onuchchhed onujayee, Vancouver er kon gontobyo mulyo-socheton bhromonkarider kachhe sobcheye kom akorshoniyo hobe? ","The correct answer is **D: Whistler**.

Here's why:

The passage describes Whistler as popular, especially for winter skiing and summer mountain biking. It's presented as a well-known destination, particularly due to the 2010 Winter Olympics. This implies it's likely to be *more* attractive to tourists, not less.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to be the least attractive to value-conscious travelers:

*   **Granville Island:** The passage states it's easily accessible from Vancouver by water taxi, making it a convenient option.
*   **Bowen Island:** It's described as a popular destination offering various activities like kayaking, hiking, and shopping, which appeal to tourists.
*   **Sea to Sky Corridor:** Described as a ""rewarding trek"" for those who enjoy outdoor activities.

Whistler, being further away (1.5-hour drive) and focused on potentially expensive activities like skiing and mountain biking, is the most likely to be less appealing to travelers looking for value."
"Onuchchhed onujayee, kon gontobyo bhromonkarider ekti khati Vancouver oviggota deoyar sombhabona sob cheye beshi?","The correct answer is **A: Bowen Island**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Bowen Island is a ""popular tourist destination"" easily accessible from Vancouver by water taxi and offers various activities. The passage focuses heavily on describing Bowen Island's attractions.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Whistler:** While mentioned, Whistler is described as being a 1.5-hour drive *from* Vancouver, making it less of a day trip *from* Vancouver itself.
*   **C: Downtown Vancouver:** The passage doesn't position downtown Vancouver as a destination for tourists *leaving* Vancouver.
*   **D: Granville Island:** The passage mentions Granville Island only as a departure point for the water taxis to Bowen Island, not as a destination in itself.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, bhromonkarider kakhon Jolopropat ti poridorshon kora uchit jodi tara badha heen drishyer sondhan kore thaken?","The correct answer is **D: Brishtir morshumer baire** (Outside the rainy season).

Here's why:

The passage states that during the rainy season (November to March) the water level is very high, and ""the entire waterfall will be obscured by the mist - all the water!"". This means visibility of the falls is *reduced* during that time.  Therefore, to see the falls without obstruction, you should visit *outside* of the rainy season.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: November theke March** - This is the *worst* time to visit for a clear view.
*   **B: Turist morshumey** - The tourist season isn't specifically linked to clear views of the falls. It could overlap with the rainy season.
*   **C: Jakhan paanir poriman beshi hoi** -  High water volume obscures the view, not enhances it.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, November theke Marcher modhye Victoria Jolopropat dekhar subidha ki?","The correct answer is **C: Jolopropater natokiyo drishyo** (Dramatic view of the waterfall).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Brishtir morshume (November thekey March), joler matra onek unchu thaake ebong jolopropatguli aro natokiyo money hobey."" This directly translates to ""During the rainy season (November to March), the water level is very high and the waterfalls become even more dramatic.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jolopropater sposhto drishyo** (Clear view of the waterfall) - The passage says the opposite - the water is *so* high you might not be able to see the falls clearly.
*   **B: Olpo sangkhyok bhromonkari** (Few tourists) - The passage mentions it's a popular tourist destination and long waits are common.
*   **D: Brishtir morshum ke erano** (Avoiding the rainy season) - The passage discusses the benefits *of* visiting during the rainy season, not avoiding it.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, video dharoner jonyo drone byabohar korar somoy nicher kontir suparish kora hoi na?","The correct answer is **D: Shudhumatro janabahul elakay chitrayan jekhane drone lokkhyo kora jabe na** (Only filming in crowded areas where drones will be targeted).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly warns against flying drones near airports or noisy locations (""bimanbandarer nikote baa ekti kolahalpurna sthane drone udano prayashai ekti baaje parikalpana"").  It doesn't discourage getting permission, extra payments if needed, or research; in fact, it *encourages* checking permissions and requirements beforehand.  However, it implies avoiding areas where a drone would be a bad idea or potentially cause issues – like crowded areas.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Apnake ki video korar anumati dewa hoyechhe ta aage thekei check kora** (Check beforehand what permission you are given to film) - This is *recommended* by the passage.
* **B: atirikto parattayana prapti** (Obtaining extra payments) - The passage mentions needing to check for ""atirikto parattayana"" (extra payments) but doesn't say *not* to obtain them.
* **C: Parmit niye gobeshona kora** (Research with permission) -  The passage encourages finding out about permissions needed.



"
"Onuchchhed onujayee, drone byabohar kore chhobi tolar sera jayga kothay?","The correct answer is **D: jesob elakar jonyo aapni aage thekei anumati peyechhen** (those areas for which you have obtained permission in advance).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**Jodi kono drone byabohar korle, aapnake kee chitrayaner anumati deoa hoyechhe ebong kono anumati baa atirikto parattayana prayojan taa agei valo korey jachai korey nin.**"" (If you use a drone, check beforehand what permissions you have for photography and whether any permits or additional returns are required).  

This directly implies that the best place to fly a drone and take pictures is a location where you *already have permission*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Emon bhirer kachhakachhi jara droneer uposthitite birokto hobe na** (Near crowds who won't object to the drone's presence) - The passage implies caution around people, not assuming acceptance.
*   **B: Jesob elakay niyomito chhobi tolar onumoti nei** (Areas where regular photography is not permitted) - This is the *opposite* of what you should do.
*   **C: Byasto jaygay jekhane drone kom dekha jay** (Busy places where drones are rarely seen) -  While avoiding attention might seem logical, it doesn't address the legal/permission aspect mentioned in the passage.

The text explicitly mentions these places for registration:

*   **Ekti sthaniyo police station** (Local police)
*   **Je hotel a tara thakchhen** (The hotel they are staying at)
*   **Obhibasan office** (Immigration office)

The text does *not* mention a post office as a place for tourist registration. Therefore, a post office is the place where a tourist would *not* go to register."
Bhromoner samay swechchhasebok hoye ke upokrito hobe na?,"The correct answer is **C: Emon keu je notun dokkhota orjon korte chai (Someone who wants to acquire new skills)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...swechchasebok hoye bhromon...ek asadharan upayy...notun dokkhota arjon korar"" which translates to ""...volunteering while traveling...is an extraordinary way...to acquire new skills.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Emon keu je bideshe notun bondhu toiri korar asha kore (Someone who hopes to make new friends abroad):** While making friends is *a* benefit of volunteering abroad, the passage emphasizes skill development as a key advantage.
* **B: Emon keu je ullekhjogyo beton khujchhe (Someone who is looking for significant pay):** The passage actually mentions that volunteering often involves minimal or no pay, and suggests a little extra money could be helpful, indicating it's *not* the primary motivator.
* **D: Emon keu je thaaka-khaoar byepare agrohi hote pare (Someone who might be uncomfortable with accommodation and food arrangements):** The passage states accommodations and food are *often* provided, suggesting it's not a major concern for those considering it.



Therefore, **C** is the most directly supported by the text."

This translates to: ""Volunteering is an extraordinary way to know a different culture, meet new people, know yourself, be aware of established relationships, and even acquire new skills."" This directly relates to gaining a different *perspective*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pray sobsomoyi beton deoya hoy** (Almost always paid) - The passage states it's *sometimes* paid, and often covers room and board. It's not consistently paid.
* **B: E thekey sadharonoto kajer sujog paoya jaay** (You usually get job opportunities from this) - The passage doesn’t mention job opportunities. It focuses on personal growth and cultural experience.
* **C: Kokhono kokhono thaaka-khaoar sujog deoya hoy** (Sometimes accommodation and food are provided) - While true, this is a *benefit* of volunteering, not the primary *benefit* to a traveler as described in the passage.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Disneyr seemanar bere naa giye saptahkhanek katano aar tarpor baari fire jaoa"" which translates to ""...spending a week without leaving Disney property and then going home.""  This directly refers to spending a week visiting the parks as a common trip format.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sekhankar ba taar baiere hotele thaaka** (Staying at hotels on or off property) - The passage mentions buses to Disney hotels, implying staying *at* Disney hotels is common, but doesn't specify it's the only option.
* **C: Disney propertyte bhromonei sompurno artho byay kora** (Spending the entire trip within Disney property) - While the passage mentions not leaving Disney property *during* the week, it doesn't state that all Disney World trips *only* involve staying within the property.
* **D: Airport theke buse kore hotele jaoya** (Going to the hotel by bus from the airport) - This is mentioned as *part* of a typical trip, but it's not the core defining characteristic of a ""Disney World trip"" as the passage frames it.



"
Walt Disney World somporke nicher kon bibrititi sotyi noi?,"The correct answer is **A: Park-hopper ticket onnyo bhromonkarir kachhe hostantorjogyo (Park-hopper tickets are transferable to other visitors)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Disney **prohibits** the sale of these tickets (""Disney dwara ety nishiddho ticketguli oferotjoggo"").  This means they are *not* meant to be transferred to other visitors.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

*   **B: Site ti te thakar byabostha achhe (There are arrangements to stay on site):** The passage mentions spending a week ""Disneyr seemanar bere naa giye"" (without leaving Disney's grounds), indicating on-site accommodation options.
*   **C: Airport theke propertyte jaoyar jonyo bus upolobdho achhe (Buses are available to get to the property from the airport):** The passage says ""buse korey Disneyr kono hotele pouchono"" (taking a bus to a Disney hotel).
*   **D: Ekadhik diner ticket praye nilamer website gulite pawa jay (Multi-day tickets are often found on auction websites):** The passage states ""Ebey baa Craiglister moto nilam websiter madhyome online bikri howya onek ticket angshikbhabe multi-day park-hopper byabohrito ticket"" (Many tickets, including multi-day park-hopper tickets, are sold online through auction websites like Craigslist).

Here's why:

The passage focuses on practical skills needed for travel to conflict zones: history, first aid, and sometimes weapons training. It mentions books and magazines about conflict zones, but emphasizes *practical* preparation.

*   **A: Jonohin sthane beche thaka (Living in uninhabited areas)** - This is related to survival skills, which would likely be part of a ""protikul poribesh course"".
*   **B: Prathomik chikitsar prostuti (Presentation of first aid)** - First aid is explicitly mentioned as a common component of such courses.
*   **C: Juddho anchaler prostuti (Presentation of conflict zones)** - The passage stresses understanding conflict zones (history, etc.), making this likely to be included.
*   **D: Bhumika palon kora (Role playing)** - While role-playing *could* be used in training, the passage focuses on concrete, immediately useful skills. Role-playing is less directly applicable to the dangers of a conflict zone compared to the other options. It's a training *method*, not a core subject matter.

Therefore, role-playing is the least likely to be a core component of the described professional training or publications."
"Onuchchhed onujayee, nimnolikhito bishoygulir modhye konti peshadar proshikkhon classe antarbhukto korar sombhabona sobcheye beshi?","Correct answer is **D: Protikul poribesh**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions a ""Protikul poribesh course"" (Hostile Environment Course) as the type of training one should take before considering travel to a conflict zone. The description of the course – 2-5 days, history, first aid, sometimes astro training – directly aligns with what's described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Prathomik chikitsa (First Aid):** While first aid *is* a component of the hostile environment course, it's not the course itself.
*   **B: Juddho anchal (Conflict Zone):** The passage suggests training *before* going to a conflict zone, not a course *about* conflict zones.
*   **C: Jonohin sthane beche thaka (Living in uninhabited places):** While potentially relevant, the passage focuses on the dangers of *conflict* zones, not general survival in remote areas.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, sombhabyo dushito jol eranor jonyo sera bikolpo ki?","The correct answer is **B: Botoler jol kena** (Buying bottled water).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""jodi chintito hoye thaken tobe aapnar ekti naamee sanstha thekey seal koraa joler bottle kenaa uchit"" which directly translates to ""if you are worried, you should buy sealed water bottles from a reputable company."" This indicates bottled water is the best option when concerned about water contamination.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Besh kichhu somoyer jonyo jol fotano** (Boiling water for a long time) - The passage mentions varying boiling times depending on the area, implying it's not always a reliable solution.
* **C: Ek minuteer jonyo jol futano** (Boiling water for one minute) - The passage explicitly states this is *only* sufficient for some areas, not all.
* **D: Kichhu nirdishto humkir jonyo jol mulyayon kora** (Evaluating water for specific attacks/contaminants) - The passage doesn't mention this; it focuses on practical solutions for potentially contaminated water.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Probal prachirer kachhakachhi satar kata** (Swimming close to a strong barrier) - The passage doesn't mention barriers.
*   **B: Gobhir jole satar kata** (Swimming in deep water) - While deep water can be dangerous, the passage specifically highlights the danger of *fighting the current*.
*   **D: Dheu er charpashe satar kata** (Swimming around waves) - The passage focuses on currents, not waves.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Jotoshighro sambhab sroter bere chole aste parley, aapnar saantaar kete fera sadharonoto kathin noy."" (If you can move perpendicular to the current, it is usually not difficult to swim back.) This means *don't* fight the current directly.
* **The passage also suggests:**  Trying to swim *against* the current (""sroter biruddhe saantaar ketey"") is the most common cause of drowning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sroter biporite druto satar katun (Swim quickly against the current):**  This is what the passage warns *against*.
* **C: Biporit dike satar katun (Swim in the opposite direction):** Similar to B, fighting the current directly will exhaust you.
* **D: Prishther niche satar katun (Swim under the surface):** The passage doesn't mention this and it wouldn't be an effective strategy.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""Iri khaale naukabihar"" (boating in the Iri Canal) as a popular tourist activity. While the passage mentions other options, the Iri Canal is directly presented as a place for a worthwhile vacation.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Daniuber parer shohor** (Cities by the Danube) - The passage mentions seeing cities *along* the Danube by boat, but doesn't specifically suggest it as a destination for a dedicated vacation focused on sightseeing.
*   **C: Raine Upotyokay** (Raine Valley) - The passage mentions visiting estates in the Raine Valley, but as *an example* of things to do, not as a primary vacation spot.
*   **D: Jekono abhyantarin jalpather kachhe** (Near any inland waterway) - While the passage starts by saying inland waterways *can* be good for vacations, it then provides *specific* examples. Choosing ""any"" is too broad and doesn't reflect the passage's focus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: boibahik abostha niye alochona kora theke biroto thaka (Avoiding discussion about marital status):** While the passage discourages *assumptions* about marital status, it doesn't advocate avoiding the topic entirely. It's more about being sensitive and avoiding direct questioning.
* **C: Jhokmoke goyna pora erhiye chola (Avoiding wearing flashy jewelry):** This isn't mentioned in the passage. It's a general safety tip, but not the specific advice given here.
* **D: Proyojone kothorota byabohar kora (Using firmness when necessary):** The passage explicitly states men should be firm and *not* back down, and this isn't applicable to women navigating cultural sensitivities.

"Onuchchhede bornito sthaaner bhittite, mohila bhromonkarider jonyo ekti sohayok tip ki hobe?","The correct answer is **C: Bujhun je sangskritik parthokyo apnake apnar juktite aatke na thaakar poramorsho daay** (Understand that cultural differences don't give you permission to compromise your judgment).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes understanding that cultural differences *do not* excuse inappropriate behavior.**  It explicitly states that just because someone claims a cultural reason for unwanted advances or attention, it doesn't make it acceptable.  It urges women to be aware that holding hands, following, etc. are not okay, regardless of cultural explanation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sweekar korun je keo onusoron kora oswavabik** (Accept that being followed is natural) - This is the *opposite* of what the passage advocates. It explicitly warns against accepting unwanted attention.
* **B: Boibahik abostha bojate ekti borho angti porun** (Wear a large ring to signify marital status) - While the passage *mentions* wearing a ring, it frames it as a supportive tool, *not* the primary solution. It emphasizes inner strength and judgment.
* **D: Obanchhito agrogotir khetre, purushder prottakhyan korar byapare drirho thakun** (Be firm in rejecting advances from men) -  This is good advice generally, but it's more a consequence of understanding the core message of the passage, not the primary ""tip"" for a female traveler.  The core tip is understanding *why* you need to be firm – because cultural differences don't justify harassment.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, kono poristhiti te ekti bishesh lens byabohar korar jonyo ekjon wildlife  alokchitrokarer proyojon hote pare?","The correct answer is **A: Jodi bishesh kore tara chhoto pranir chhobi tole** (If specifically they are taking pictures of small animals).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Wildlife photographyr jonno prayashoi ekti lamba telephoto lens-er prayojan hoy, jodio pakhir jhank baa khudro jeeber jonno anyanno lens prayojan."" This translates to: ""Wildlife photography often requires a long telephoto lens, *however* other lenses may be needed for bird glimpses or small creatures.""

This directly indicates a need for different lenses depending on the subject - specifically, smaller creatures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Chhobiguli jodi banijyik kaje byabohar kora hoi** (If the pictures are to be used for commercial purposes) - The passage mentions restrictions on commercial use, but doesn't say it necessitates a special lens.
*   **C: Jodi je pranir chhobi tola hochhe tara lajuk hoi** (If the animal being photographed is shy) - The passage says wild animals aren't necessarily shy, but can be aggressive. Shyness doesn't dictate lens choice.
*   **D: Jodi kono parke bonyopranir chhobi tola niya bishesh niyom thake** (If there are special rules about taking pictures of wildlife in a park) - The passage mentions restrictions but doesn’t directly link it to needing a specific lens.

Nicher konti wildlife photographerder jonyo sombhabyo challenge hisabe onuchchhede ullekh kora hoyni?,"The correct answer is **C: Proyojoniyo lenser dhoron source kora**.

Here's why:

The text *does* mention the need for different types of lenses (like telephoto lenses) for wildlife photography. It specifically states: ""Wildlife photographyr jonno prayashoi ekti lamba telephoto lens-er prayojan hoy, jodio pakhir jhank baa khudro jeeber jonno anyanno lens prayojan.""  Therefore, sourcing the necessary lenses is discussed, not omitted.

The text *does* mention:

*   **A: Kichhu bideshi prani khoja** - ""Onek bideshi prani achhe jegulo sahoje khuje paowa jayna"" (Many foreign animals are difficult to find).
*   **B: Akromonattok pranider sathe mokabila kora** - ""Buno pranira hoy lajuk noy akromonattok hote paare"" (Wild animals are not shy, they can be aggressive).
*   **D: Sombhabyo protikul poribeshe kaaj kora** - ""Poribesh sheetal, garam, baa onnothai protikul hote paare"" (The environment can be cold, hot, or otherwise harsh).

Therefore, option C is the only challenge *not* explicitly mentioned in the provided text."
Nicher konti pahari poth diye bhromonkari chaloker jonyo sombhoboto sobcheye kom somosya srishti korbe?,"Correct answer: **A: Prochur traffic**

Here's why:

The passage discusses the dangers of driving in snowy/icy conditions: reduced traction, feeling like you're sliding, and reduced visibility. Let's break down why each option is or isn't the biggest problem for a new driver:

*   **A: Prochur traffic:** While traffic can be frustrating, *more* traffic actually provides benefits in snowy conditions. Other vehicles create tracks, which can offer slightly better traction than untouched snow. Also, a slower pace of traffic reduces the risk of losing control.

*   **B: Kom gharshon (Low friction):** This is a *major* hazard, directly stated in the passage. Low friction makes it difficult to steer and brake.

*   **C: Otyodhik sangkochon (Excessive contraction):** This isn't a primary concern when driving in snow or ice.

*   **D: Drishyomanota hras (Reduced visibility):** Also a significant hazard mentioned in the passage, making it harder to see and react to hazards.

**Therefore, while all the factors are important, plentiful traffic is the *least* problematic for a new driver in these conditions, and might even be slightly helpful.**"
Bibhinno deshe aykar somporke konti samonjosyopurno thakar sombhabona royechhe?,"The correct answer is **D: Bracket**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""korer haar ebong bracketguli ek desh thekey anno deshe byapok tartomyo hoy"" which translates to ""tax rates and brackets vary widely from one country to another.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Haar (Rate):** While rates *do* vary, the passage focuses on the broader concept of ""brackets"" which encompass the rate structure.
* **B: Porikathamo (Calculation):** The passage doesn't discuss the methods of calculation directly, only that they are organized differently.
* **C: Jekhane apni file korben (Where you file):**  This is about *where* you file, not a similarity or difference in tax systems.

"Onuchchhed onujayee, apni jodi bideshe kaaj koren kintu onyo kothao bosobas koren, apni kothay apnar aaykor joma deben?","The correct answer is **C: Je deshe apni bortomane kaaj korchhen** (The country where you are currently working).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Jodi apni kutnitibid naa hon, tahole bideshe kaaj koraa maane aapnake aykar dakhil korte hobey jei deshe apni achhen."" This translates to: ""If you are not a diplomat, working abroad means you have to file taxes in the country where you are present.""

Therefore, regardless of where you usually reside, your tax obligations are tied to the country where you *earn* the income (where you are working).

Nicher kon bibrititi World’s Fair-ke sothibhabe bornona kore na?,"The correct answer is **D: Deshgulir ongsho grohon kora proyojoniyo noi** (Participation of countries is not necessary).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ongshogrohonkari deshguli jatiya monche bishwer samasya baa taander desher sanskriti ebong itihas shoilpik ebong shikkhamulak bhabe uposthapito koren."" (Participating countries present world problems or their country's culture and history artistically and educationally). This means participation *is* necessary.

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Prodorshonguli ekti desher itihas ba sangskritik prodorshon korte pare** (Exhibitions can showcase a country's history or culture) - This is directly stated in the passage.
*   **B: Shoilpik ebong shikkhamulok prodorshoner pashapashi udvid songkranto prodorshonguli prodorshito hoi** (Alongside artistic and educational exhibitions, exhibitions related to horticulture are also showcased) - The passage mentions ""phool prodorshoni, udvid bagan ebong gaachh sakranta anno je kono kichhu prodorshon korey"" (flower exhibitions, botanical gardens and anything related to trees).
*   **C: eventguli chhoy maas porjonto cholte pare** (The events can last up to six months) - The passage states ""sadharonoto tin thekey choy mas dhorey je kono sthane chole"" (usually runs for three to six months).



"
Nicher konti World’s Fair ba antorjatik prodorshonir niyom?,"The correct answer is **A: Prodorshoniti oboshyoi ekti desher itihas ebong bishwa somosya uvoy e prodorshon korbe** (The exhibition must showcase both a country's history and world problems).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ongshogrohonkari deshguli jatiya monche bishwer samasya baa taander desher sanskriti ebong itihas shoilpik ebong shikkhamulak bhabe uposthapito koren."" (Participating countries present world problems or their country's culture and history artistically and educationally.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ek e desh barshik bhittite onushthaner ayojon korte pare na** (One country cannot organize the annual event) - The passage states they *are* organized annually (though not consistently in the same place) and doesn’t say a country *can't* organize them.
* **C: Onushthan oboshyoi chhoy maas porjonto onushthito hobe** (The event must be held for six months) - The passage says they typically last *three to six months*, not necessarily six months.
* **D: Melati ayojoner jonyo, sob deshk oboshyoi ongsho grohon korte hobe** (For the fair to be organized, all countries must participate) - The passage doesn’t state all countries *must* participate. It speaks of ""participating countries.""



"
Nicher konti korle pranir akromoner sombhabona kombe?,"The correct answer is **B: Camp site theke aborjona oposaron korle** (Moving away from the campsite).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""bhalouk ebong nekreder thekey kompokkhe 100 goj/meter dure ebong onno samasta bonno prani thekey 25 goj/meter dure thakun!"" (Stay at least 100 feet away from bears and predators and 25 feet away from all other wildlife!). It also mentions keeping a safe distance is crucial because animals can attack, and people get injured every year due to lack of distance.
* **Moving away from the campsite reduces your proximity to animals**, thus decreasing the chance of an encounter and attack.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sugondhi bheshoj bohon korle** (Applying scented medicines) - The passage warns *against* strong smells, saying to avoid leaving food or cooking smells, and keep the campsite clean.
* **C: Nekreder theke 25 goj durotto bojay rakhle** (Staying 25 feet away from predators) - While this is mentioned in the passage, it's not the *most* effective way to reduce attack probability.  It's a minimum distance, but proactively moving *away* from potential animal areas is better.
* **D: Khabarer uchchhishto diye praanider damon korle** (Taming animals with food scraps) -  The passage clearly states animals should be left alone in their natural habitat and implies not feeding them. Feeding them would likely *increase* the risk of an encounter and make them more habituated to humans.



"
Nicher konti bonyopranir akromoner sombhabyo karon hisabe onuchchhede ullekh nei?,"The correct answer is **B: durotto bojay rakhte byartho howa** (failing to maintain a safe distance).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Jothajotho durotto naa bojai rakhar karone proti bochor koyek dojen dorshok khotigrosto hoy."" This translates to ""Every year, several dozen viewers are injured because they do not maintain a safe distance.""  This directly links injuries to not keeping enough distance from the animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kora gondho** (bad smell) - The text mentions smells attract animals, and advises cleaning up food and waste, but doesn't say bad smell *causes* attacks.
*   **C: Bonyopranider khawano** (feeding the animals) - The text specifically states animals should *not* be fed. While feeding can be problematic, the passage doesn't list it as a direct cause of attacks.
*   **D: Manusher sathe oporichito prani** (animals familiar with humans) - The text emphasizes these are *wild* and potentially dangerous animals, not habituated ones.
