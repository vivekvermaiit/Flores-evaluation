He aha te pakanga e whakaahuatia ana i ētahi wā ko te ‘pakanga whakapono’ whakamutunga?,"The correct answer is **A: E toru tekau tau te Pakanga**.

The passage states: ""Me te aha, ko tēnei pakanga torutekau tau te pakanga whakamutunga e tohua ai he pakanga hāhī."" This directly translates to ""And so, this Thirty Years' War was the last war to be designated a war of religion.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pakanga Tau Rau (Hundred Years' War):** This war predates the concept of the balance of power as described in the passage.
* **C: Pakanga o te angitu Pāniora (Spanish Succession War):** While mentioned as an example of a war *caused* by the balance of power, it's not described as the last religious war.
* **D: Pakanga Tūmatanui Pāniora (Great Spanish War):**  This isn't a commonly known war referred to as the last religious war.

Ko tehea o ngā āhuatanga e whai ake nei o te Hāhi Katorika kāore i tirotirohia?,"The correct answer is **A: Mēnā he tika te tohatoha taonga i roto i te Hāhi (Whether the distribution of wealth within the Church is fair)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly discusses the Church's accumulation of wealth and questions whether this practice is justified.** It mentions the use of wealth to alleviate suffering and fund the church, but also notes the long-standing power and wealth concentrated in Rome, leading to questions about potential exploitation (""mēnā rānei kei te tūtakina tēnei whakapono"" - whether this belief is being exploited).

Let's look at why the other options are less directly addressed:

* **B: Mēnā me whakarerekē ngā kaupapa matua o te hāhi (Whether the fundamental principles of the Church should be changed):** The passage talks about questioning the *practice* of wealth accumulation, not necessarily the fundamental *beliefs* themselves.
* **C: Te whakamōhiotanga o te mana i roto i te Hāhi (The awareness of power within the Church):** The passage *mentions* the Church's power, but doesn't question whether people *understand* that power. It focuses on the implications *of* that power.
* **D: Mehemea e tutuki ana nga pae matua o te Hāhi (Whether the fundamental goals of the Church are being achieved):** While the passage implies a potential disconnect between the Church's actions and its goals, it doesn’t explicitly question whether those goals are being met. It's more concerned with the fairness of *how* the Church operates financially.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i patua i Versailles?","The correct answer is **D: He kaitiaki**. 

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I tētahi wā i pōwhiriwhiritia e tētahi mema o te māpu i te upoko o tētahi tautiaki o te whare ariki i whakamatehia ki Versailles ki te aroaro o te Kuīni ihiihi."" 

This translates to: ""At one point a member of the crowd severed the head of a palace guard who was killed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.""

Therefore, a guard was killed at Versailles.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei kihai i whakatikatikahia ki te Kingi me te Kuini e te mano?,"The correct answer is **A: Te whakatuwheratanga o ō rātou matapihi waka** (The opening of their carriage windows).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""I tōpana te māpu tāngata nei i te Kīngi me te Kuīni kia tītoretore ngā matapihi o tō rāua kāreti."" (The crowd demanded the King and Queen open the windows of their carriage). This means the crowd *demanded* this, but it wasn't something *done to* them without their consent.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He putanga ohorere mai i Versailles** (A sudden departure from Versailles) - The passage clearly describes being *taken* to Paris, not a sudden departure they initiated.
* **C: He tirohanga mo te pane o te kaitiaki** (A view of the guard's death) - The passage explicitly states the Queen witnessed the head of a guard being paraded.
* **D: He haere ki Parihi** (A trip to Paris) - They were forcibly taken to Paris by the crowd.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te hua o te pakanga moana kore noa o Ingarangi?,"The correct answer is **D: Kāore i te taea te whakawātea i ngā rawa nui** (Major assets could not be cleared).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""i aukatia ngā rawa waiwai mā te tauā, mā te iwi whānui"" (assets were seized by the military and the public). This *directly contradicts* the idea that major assets couldn't be cleared.  The blockade *did* result in the seizure of assets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kei te hiahia a Tiamana ki te whakamahi i ngā tikanga pakanga ōrite** (Germany wanted to use similar warfare tactics) - The passage explicitly links Britain's unrestricted naval warfare to Germany wanting to do the same with its U-boats (""ko te kawatau a Tiamani ka pērā anō te urupare ki tāna mahi pakanga waka whakatakere here kore""). This *is* a result of Britain's actions.
* **B: I tūkinotia nga kaipuke kāore i te tūkinotia** (Ships were sunk that weren't sunk) - The passage mentions that neutral ships were also affected (""mōrearea hoki ai ngā waipuke ngū"" - neutral ships were also distressed). This is a direct consequence.
* **C: I mahia he huringa ki te ture o te ao whānui** (Changes were made to international law) - The passage states the blockade ""takahi tēnei aukati i te ture ā-ao"" (this blockade violated international law), and was challenged by existing international agreements.  This shows a disruption and potential change to international law.



Therefore, the *only* option that isn't a result of Britain’s unrestricted naval warfare is that major assets couldn't be cleared, as the passage states they *were* cleared."
Ko tehea kōrero e kore e tino whakaahua i te aukati moana a Ingarangi ki Tiamana?,"The correct answer is **A: I haere ki te ture o te ao whānui (It adhered to international law)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the blockade *violated* international law.** It says ""i takahi tēnei aukati i te ture ā-ao"" (this blockade violated international law) and notes it was challenged by some international agreements.  Therefore, option A is incorrect as it describes the opposite of what happened.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

* **B: Nāna i āki te riri waka ruku o Tiamana (It blocked German submarine warfare):** The passage mentions Britain blockading waters to prevent ships, including submarines, from reaching important areas of the ocean (""i maina a Peretānia i ngā wai ā-ao hei aukati i te urunga atu o ngā waipuke"").
* **C: I haukotia e ia te rere o nga rawa Tiamana (It seized German assets):** The passage states assets were seized through war and by the public (""i aukatia ngā rawa waiwai mā te tauā, mā te iwi whānui"").
* **D: I whakarite kia kaua e whakawehia ngā kaipuke tōrangapū (It arranged for neutral ships not to be sunk):** While not explicitly stated, the passage implies Britain was trying to control maritime activity, and limiting the sinking of neutral ships would be a part of that. The reference to Germany potentially responding with unrestricted submarine warfare supports this idea.



Therefore, **A** is the only statement that doesn't align with the information provided in the passage."
"I runga anō i te haerenga, ko wai e tino pai ai te tātaitanga o te Sclerosis Maha?","The correct answer is **A: He wāhine 32 tau te pakeke**.

Here's why:

The text states that MS is the most common neurological disease affecting young and middle-aged adults. It *also* states that women are twice as likely to be affected by MS as men.  Option A fits both criteria – a woman in her 30s (a typical age for young/middle-aged adulthood).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He tāne 15 tau te pakeke** - 15 is very young for MS to commonly present itself.
* **C: He tāne 43 tau te pakeke** - While 43 is within the young/middle-aged range, the text emphasizes the *higher* risk for women.
* **D: He wāhine 10 tau te pakeke** - 10 is too young for MS to commonly manifest.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, e hiahiatia ana e ngā kaiuru i roto i ngā ngohe auau he tautoko anō mō te aha?","The correct answer is **A: Te kitenga tōraro o te mamae** (A clearer understanding of pain).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ko te hunga e whai wāhi ana ki te oi auau ka nui ake te tautoko ka hiahiatia e pā ana ki te tirohanga kino o te mamae...""  This translates to ""Those participating in frequent exercise need more support regarding the negative perception of pain...""

Therefore, the text directly indicates they need more support to understand pain better, specifically to address negative perceptions of it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Te tuarā o raro** (Lower back) - The text doesn't mention lower back specifically.
* **C: Pēhitanga** (Depression) - While the text touches on negative thoughts, it doesn’t specifically mention needing support for depression.
* **D: Wehi** (Fear) - The text mentions fear around mortality, but not as a specific need for support for those exercising.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he pēhea te tākaro o te taiapa?","The correct answer is **D: I roto i tētahi hōputu duel** (In a duel format).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kei te mātua tākarotia tēnei hākinakina ki te takotoranga takirua, arā ko tētahi fencer e whawhai ana ki tētahi atu.""  This translates to ""...this sport is mainly played in a duel format, that is, a fencer fighting another.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I roto i tētahi hōputu hōu** (In a new format) - The passage doesn't mention a new format.
* **B: I te taumata o te whare wānanga** (At the university level) - While the passage mentions universities, it doesn't say *how* the sport is played at that level, only that people practice it there.
* **C: I te taumata Olympic** (At the Olympic level) - The passage mentions the World Championships, but doesn’t specifically state it’s played like that at the Olympics.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei te tohu tino kaha o te mate paitini o roto?","The correct answer is **D: He pounamu pire rongoā** (An open container of medicine or household chemicals).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te tohu pai rawa o te paihana ā-roto ko te noho ki reira a tētahi ipu tuwhera o te rongoā, o ngā matū ā-whare tāoke rānei.""  This directly translates to ""The best sign of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medicine or household chemicals.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Naseka me te kirikā** (Nausea and vomiting) - While these *can* be symptoms, the passage says they can be mild and hard to determine immediately.
* **B: ruaki me te werawera** (Sweating and fever) - Similar to nausea/vomiting, these are possible symptoms but not the *best* indicator according to the passage.
* **C: mamae nui me te mamae puku** (Severe pain and stomach pain) - Again, possible symptoms, but not the primary indicator mentioned.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te hipanga tuatahi tika ina arotake ana i tētahi tūkino?","The correct answer is **C: Tirohia te tūnga o te tūkino** (Check the situation/location of the injury).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""**i te tuatahi me tiro koe ki te wāhi kia whakarite ka haumaru koe.**"" This translates to ""first you must check the place to make sure you are safe.""  This directly relates to assessing the *situation* or *location* of the injury before approaching.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tirohia te tirohanga** (Look at the outlook/view) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **B: Whakaaro i te hunga i aituā** (Think about the injured people) - While important, the passage focuses on *your* safety and initial assessment *before* dealing with the injured.
* **D: Tatari mō te āwhina** (Wait for help) - The passage implies taking action, not just waiting.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e kore e tino whakaatu i te tukanga o te tirotiro i te patunga?,"The correct answer is **A: Kaua e māharahara ki te tautāwhi i ō ake mate (Don't worry about risking your own life)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) emphasizes safety first.** It says to check the area *to ensure your own safety* and warns that attempting a rescue could worsen the situation if *you* get hurt.  While self-preservation is important, the passage doesn't explicitly say to *not worry* about your own safety - it states to *prioritize* it.

Let's look at why the other options *are* reflected in the passage:

* **B: Ka tohu i te tirohanga i mua i te tūkinotanga (Assess the situation before acting)** - The passage starts with ""i te tuatahi me tiro koe ki te wāhi"" (first you must check the area) which is assessing before acting.
* **C: Tirohia te waahi o te patunga (Check the location of the accident)** - This is directly stated in the passage: ""me tiro koe ki te wāhi.""
* **D: Me ngana ki te pānui i ētahi kara Whero (Try to read any warning signs)** - The passage mentions being aware of ""ngā tohu mōrearea pea"" (possible danger signs).

Therefore, option A is the one that doesn't directly align with the advice given in the passage.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā huringa i puta mai i te French Revolution i whai pānga nui ki ngā tāngata mahi?,"The correct answer is **B: He neke arotahi mai i te karaehe ki te māiatanga** (A shift in focus from lineage to merit).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ko te nekehanga ake mai i te whai tūturutanga ki te noho hei mana motuhake, hei mana whenua..."" This directly translates to a shift *away* from inherited status (lineage/karaehe) and *towards* personal ability and achievement (merit/māiatanga).  The passage also mentions military advancement being based on skill (""matatau"") rather than birth (""karangatanga"").
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Te nui ake o te tautoko mō te iwi:** While the passage *mentions* the people holding power, it doesn't specifically say support for the people *increased* as a result of the revolution, it states the people *became* the power.
    * **C: He whakatamarikitanga o te ariā o te Pākehā:**  The passage doesn't discuss the diminishing of European authority.
    * **D: He pūnaha ine hōu:** The passage mentions a new tax system, but doesn't position it as the *most* significant change for working people.  The change in how people gain power and status is much more central to impacting their lives.



Therefore, option B best reflects the significant impact of the French Revolution on the working class as described in the passage – a move towards opportunities based on ability rather than social standing."
"I muri i te French Revolution, he iti ake te tūponotanga o te angitu i roto i te ope taua me ētahi atu mahi i runga i te aha?","The correct answer is **B: Tauaha** (Skill/Competence).

Here's why:

The passage states: *""Nā te Pakanga a Wīwī i hihiri ai te hunga rawakore nō iwi kē ki te whawhai i ō rātou ake whahai. Ka pērā hoki te ope tauā nā te mea ka whakaritea ngā akunga ope tauā i runga i te **matatau**, kaua ko te karangatanga.""*

This translates to: ""The French Revolution inspired the poor from different tribes to fight for their own pursuits. Also, the army was like this because army entry was based on **skill/competence**, not lineage.""

Therefore, after the French Revolution, success in the military and other roles became less about *tutukitanga* (lineage/ancestry) and more about *tauaha* (skill/competence).



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tutukitanga:** The passage explicitly states this *decreased* in importance.
*   **C: Te Hiahia:** (Desire) While desire is important, the passage focuses on a change in the *criteria* for advancement.
*   **D: Kaliber:** (Caliber/Quality) While quality is linked to skill, *tauaha* is the direct term used in the passage to describe the new basis for advancement.



"
Ko tehea te mahi tūmatanui e kiia ana ko te mea nui rawa o te riri i roto i nga whenua whakawhanake?,"The correct answer is **A: Kounga wai (Water quality)**.

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

The text directly states: ""...in developed countries, it is difficult to hear complaints about the quality of water, or the stability of bridges."" This implies that *water quality* is a major concern – a source of complaints – in *less* developed countries (the opposite of ""developed"").  The question asks about the biggest source of anger/frustration in developing countries, and the text points to issues with basic necessities like water quality.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: hanganga arawhiti (Infrastructure construction):** While infrastructure is important, the text specifically mentions bridge *stability* as something *not* usually complained about in developed nations, suggesting it's not the primary issue.
* **C: waka tūmatanui (Major transport):**  The text doesn't discuss transportation.
* **D: Mātauranga (Education):** The text *starts* by talking about education systems, but then quickly shifts to concerns about basic infrastructure and resources.



Therefore, **kounga wai (water quality)** aligns most directly with the concerns raised in the passage."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te kōrero mo nga pūnaha whakawhiti tūmatanui?","The correct answer is **C: He maha ngā amuamu o te hunga e whakamahi ana i a rātau** (There are many concerns of those who use them).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ko te nuiga ka amuamu mō ngā pūnaha mauranga."" (Many are concerned about knowledge systems.)  It then goes on to detail those concerns – worries about water quality and pesticide residues – specifically *in developed countries* where these systems are prevalent.  This directly supports the idea that people have many concerns when using these systems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E arohaina ana e te katoa e whakamahi ana i a rātau** (Everyone who uses them appreciates them) - The text focuses on *concerns*, not appreciation.
* **B: Kaore rātau i te kino ki te kounga o te wai** (They do not harm water quality) - The text specifically mentions concerns *about* water quality.
* **D: E wātea ana rātau i te nuinga o nga whenua tipua** (They are available in most developing countries) - The text states the concerns are more common in *developed* countries.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he uaua ki te ine nā te kore āheitanga o ngā atekōkiri?","The correct answer is **D: Rere Waka (Traffic Flow)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He uaua te rangahau i te rere o ngā waka nā te mea e kore e taea te matapae i te whanonga taraiwa ki te mōhiotanga kotahi-rau ōrau."" This directly translates to: ""It is difficult to research traffic flow because it is not possible to predict driving style with 100% certainty.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tere o te waka (Speed of the vehicle)**: The passage *uses* speed as one of the three key factors being related, it doesn't say it's difficult to measure.
*   **B: Whakarite huarahi (Route planning)**: This isn't discussed as something difficult to determine in the passage.
*   **C: Mahinga huarahi (Road construction)**: While the passage mentions these factors help *with* road construction, it doesn't say construction itself is hard to measure.

Therefore, the passage specifically identifies **traffic flow** as difficult to study due to unpredictable driver behavior."
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whakamahia ana ina whakaatu ana i tētahi rerenga waka i runga i te pāngarau?,"The correct answer is **D: kiato o nga waka** (vehicle density).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that to better represent traffic flow, relationships are established between three key aspects: **flow, density, and speed.**  Vehicle density (kiato o nga waka) is one of those three core components used in mathematical modeling of traffic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mahinga huarahi (Road operations):**  While related to traffic, this is a broader concept than a specific modeling component.
*   **B: whanonga atekōkiri (Driving style):** The passage *mentions* that individual driving styles are difficult to predict, but it focuses on using averages and modeling vehicles as similar for the sake of a mathematical representation.
*   **C: hoahoa huarahi (Road design):**  The passage states that the relationships between flow, density and speed *help* with road design, but isn't what's *used* in the model itself.



"
He aha te mea i whakamahia e Hershey rāua ko Chase hei tāuru i tō rāua DNA? ,"The correct answer is **D: huaketo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I whakamahingia e Hershey me Chase ngā wāhanga, ngā huaketo rānei hei whakauru i ō rātou ake pītau ira ki roto ki tētahi kitakita.""  This translates to ""Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages (or components thereof) to introduce their viral DNA into a bacterium.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā āwhā Reo Irirangi (Radioactive Isotopes)** - While radioactive isotopes *were* used to label the DNA and protein, they weren't the method of *delivery*.
*   **B: Rawa iranga (Iron Resources)** - Iron isn't mentioned in relation to their experiment.
*   **C: Sulfur Reo Irirangi (Radioactive Sulfur)** - Radioactive sulfur was used to label the protein, not the DNA.

Therefore, the bacteriophages (huaketo) were used to deliver the viral DNA into the bacteria."
E whakawhirinaki ana ki te aha te kaha o te huringa ki te tuku ki te uri?,"The correct answer is **C: Te momo irakētanga** (The type of mutation).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly states:** ""He maha ngā momo iranoi...kei runga i tōna momo e kitea ai ka pēhea e raru ai..."" (There are many types of mutations...depending on its type, it can be seen how damaging it is...).  The passage focuses on *how* a mutation is damaging depending on *what kind* of mutation it is.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Mēnā he rārangi-ā-rārangi ngā pūtau** (If the mutations are in a chain) - The passage doesn't emphasize *where* the mutation is, but *what* it is.
    * **B: Te tikanga o te rawa iranga** (The nature of the genetic material) - While important, the passage isn't about the overall genetic material, but the specific changes (mutations).
    * **D: Mēnā ka taea e te irakētanga te mate pūtau** (If the mutation can cause seedling death) - This is a *result* of a mutation, not what determines its severity/transmissibility.

Therefore, the passage emphasizes that the **type of mutation** is the key factor in understanding its consequences and how likely it is to be passed on.



"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i hoatu i roto i te wāhanga nei, he aha te kore e whakawhirinaki ki ngā pānga rerekē o ngā huringa?","The correct answer is **A: He aha te nui o te rauemi iranga e pā ana** (What is the amount of iron resource affected).

Here's why:

The passage states that the *extent* of the problem (how badly it's affected), the *intensity* of the affected iron type, and *whether only variations in iron lines or more serious things like iron disease or cancer arise* depend on the *type of iron* and *how many irons are affected*.  

Option A directly addresses the ""how many"" aspect - the *amount* of iron resource impacted. This is a key factor in determining the different effects of changes.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **B: Mēnā he rārangi-ā-rārangi ngā pūtau pāngia** (Whether the affected deposits are layered) - The passage doesn't mention anything about layered deposits.
* **C: Te tikanga o te rawa iranga pāngia** (The nature of the affected iron resource) - While ""nature"" is related, the passage focuses on *quantity* being a determinant of effect.
* **D: Te momo irakētanga pāngia** (The type of irakētanga affected) - ""Irakētanga"" seems like a typo and possibly means ""iron"". Even if it's correct, the passage primarily states the *type of iron* dictates the problem, not the *type of change* affecting it.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te take i mau ai ngā iwi o mua i ngā koati?,"The correct answer is **B: I āwhina rātau ki te graze i te whenua** (They helped to graze the land).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ka tīmata ngā ahurea me ngā iwi tawhito te pupuri i ērā kia māmā ai te āheinga atu ki te miraka, te huruhuru, me kiko..."" (Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping goats to ease access to milk, wool, and meat...).  While meat is mentioned, the primary benefit highlighted is access to resources *through* the goats' abilities - primarily grazing.
* **Grazing as a benefit:** Goats are effective grazers, meaning they help manage vegetation. This would have been valuable for early agricultural communities.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: I tukua e rātau he āheitanga ki te mīti (They provided a source of meat):**  Meat is *a* benefit, but not the *primary* reason stated for initially domesticating goats. The passage emphasizes the wider range of resources.
* **C: I tukuna e rātau he hoa (They provided companionship):** The passage doesn't mention companionship as a reason for keeping goats.
* **D: I tukua e rātau he urunga ki te miraka (They provided access to milk):** Milk is mentioned, but again, is one of several benefits, not the sole or primary one.



"
Ko te whāinga o te korowha ko te tango i te iti rawa o te aha?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā pōro (The balls)**.

Here's why:

The passage states players use clubs to hit balls into holes. The goal is to complete the course with the *fewest* strokes *or* hits to the ball. Therefore, the goal revolves around getting the balls into the holes efficiently.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Stokes (Strokes):** While the number of strokes is important for *winning*, it's not the object you're trying to *take* or acquire.
*   **C: Te wā (The time):** Time isn't mentioned as a primary goal in the passage.
*   **D: Ngā kōhao (The holes):** You're hitting the ball *into* the holes, not taking them.



"
"I runga i te papa korowha, kei hea te tapahi i te tarutaru?","The correct answer is **B: Kei runga i te kākāriki**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...he pōtehe ake te otaota kei te kōhao, ko te kākariki te ingoa."" This translates to ""...there is a mound on the course, named the green.""  The ""tapahi i te tarutaru"" (tee shot) happens *on* the green, which is the mound.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I te rua tekau ma waru** - While the course has 18 holes, the tee shot doesn't specifically happen at hole 18.
*   **C: I te rua tuatahi** - Same reasoning as above - it's not specific to hole 1.
*   **D: I te haurua tuatahi o te akoranga** - This is too vague and not directly stated in the text.



"
He aha te whāinga o tētahi whakamātautau?,"The correct answer is **A: Hei whakakore i tētahi, neke atu rānei o ngā ariā pea** (To disprove one or more hypotheses).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...ko te mātaitanga ko tētahi whakamātautau e whakamahia ana **hei whakakore i te whakapae kotahi, neke atu rānei**..."" (…observation is a test used **to disprove one hypothesis, or more**…).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hei whakaaro me pēhea te mahi a te ao** (To think about how the world works) - While science *aims* to understand how the world works, a test itself doesn't *think* - it *tests* ideas.
* **C: Hei pātai** (To ask) - Asking questions is part of the scientific process, but a test is about *answering* questions, or more precisely, evaluating potential answers.
* **D: Hei ārahi i te rangahau pūtaiao** (To guide scientific research) -  Tests *inform* research, but their primary function isn’t to guide it, but to evaluate existing ideas.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te kore e āwhina ki te ārahi i te rangahau pūtaiao?","The correct answer is **B: Kei te kite** (Observation alone).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ehara i te mea ko ia ki tōna kotahi, te mātaitanga, ā, ko te mātaitanga ko tētahi whakamātautau e whakamahia ana hei whakakore i te whakapae kotahi...""  This translates to: ""Observation alone is not sufficient, and observation is a test used to disprove a hypothesis...""

This clearly indicates that observation *needs* to be combined with testing and hypothesis disproving to guide scientific research.  Simply *seeing* something isn't enough; you need to actively test and challenge your understanding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ko te tikanga pūtaiao anake** (The scientific method alone) - The passage *states* the scientific method guides research.
* **C: E whakaiti ana i ngā tinihanga ka taea te whakakore** (Reducing assumptions that can be disproven) - This is a *part* of the scientific method described in the passage.
* **D: whakahaere whakamātautau** (Conducting tests) -  The passage specifically mentions testing as essential (""whakamātautau e whakamahia ana"").

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea kōrero mo nga āwhiowhio ehara i te tika?","The correct answer is **A: Ka taea e ngā tornado te whakangaro i ngā mea katoa i tō rātou āhua** (Tornadoes can destroy everything in their path).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ka patu te āhiowhio i tētahi wāhi iti noa nei i ngā āwha kino, engari ka turakina te katoa e whakapōrearea ana i a ia."" (Tornadoes hit a relatively small area of severe weather, but destroy everything in their path.)  This *implies* they destroy everything *in their path*, not *everything* overall. It doesn’t state they can destroy *all* things, everywhere.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: Ka tuki a ngā Tornado i ngā wāhi iti iho i ētahi atu āwhā** (Tornadoes hit smaller areas than other weather events) - The passage starts by stating this directly: ""Ka patu te āhiowhio i tētahi wāhi iti noa nei...""
* **C: Neke atu i te toru haora te nuinga o nga āwhiowhio** (Most tornadoes last more than three hours) -  The passage states: ""Neke atu i te toru hāora ngā āwhawhiowhio kaha rawa atu e rērere ana.""
* **D: Ka taea e ētahi ngaru te nga tornado ki te 300 maero i te haora** (Some tornadoes can reach speeds of 300 miles per hour) – The passage states winds can reach 480 km/h (which translates to around 300 mph).



Therefore, option A is the only statement *not* directly supported by the text and is the most inaccurate."
"I runga anō i te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e tino tika ana te whakaahua i te nuinga o ngā hau?","The correct answer is **B: Ka waihangahia e rātau he hau e pā ana ki te 480 maero i te haora**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Kei ēnei āwhā rahi rawa ngā hau tae atu ki te 480 km/h (133 m/s); 300m/h).""  This directly supports the idea that the tornadoes create winds reaching 480 km/h.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I te nuinga o te wā ka roa ake i te toru haora:** While the passage says the strongest tornadoes last over three hours, it doesn't say *most* do.
* **C: He nui ake ngā wāhi e pā ana ki a rātau i ētahi atu tupuhi:** The passage doesn't compare the area affected by tornadoes to other storms.
* **D: Ka taea e rātau te hutia ngā rākau i te whenua:** While the passage *mentions* trees being uprooted, it's a *result* of the wind, not the defining characteristic.  Option B focuses on the *speed of the wind itself*, which is the central point of the passage regarding the tornadoes' power.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei mea i tīmata te tangata ki te mahi i te rau tau 16?,"The correct answer is **D: Hanga whātata** (Making telescopes).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""i hangaia ngā karu whātata tūturu tuatahi ki Ūropi i te mutunga o te rautau tua 16"" - This translates to ""the first true telescopes were made in Europe at the end of the 16th century.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Te whakamahi arotahi** (Using lenses) - The passage says lenses have been used for *thousands of years*, not just starting in the 16th century.
* **B: Whakarahi ana i ngā ahanoa** (Magnifying things) -  Similar to lenses, magnification has been known for a long time.
* **C: Hanga arotahi ana** (Making lenses) - While lens making is related, the passage specifically mentions the creation of *telescopes* in the 16th century, which are more than just lenses.



"
Kua pehea te roa o te whakamahinga o te tangata i te whakarahi i ngā ahanoa mā te whakamahi i ngā karu?,"The correct answer is **C: Mo nga mano tau** (For thousands of years).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kua hangaia, kua whakamahia hoki e te tangata ngā arotahi mō te whakarahi mō te tini mano tau."" (People have created and used focusing tools for magnification for thousands of years.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kotahi mano nga tau** (One thousand years) - While true they've been used for *at least* a thousand years, the passage says *thousands* of years.
* **B: Mai i te rau tau 16 o muri** (From the 16th century onwards) - The passage specifically states glasses were *first* created in Europe at the end of the 16th century, not that magnification began then.
* **D: Mai i te rau tau 16 o mua** (From the 16th century ago) - This doesn't make sense grammatically and isn't supported by the text.

"I runga i te waahanga, he aha te korero a te ana o Muhammad mo ana mahi wairua, tikanga ranei?","The correct answer is **A: E uara ana a ia ki te rangimārie me te taratahitanga (He values peace and tranquility)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the cave (Hira) as a place of isolation and quiet contemplation.**  ""Ka tomo atu ana ki te ana, he mohoaotanga katoa. Kāore he paku aha ka kitea tēnā i te rangi paki o runga..."" (When he entered the cave, it was complete silence. Nothing could be seen of the open sky...). This strongly suggests Muhammad sought a peaceful, undisturbed environment for his spiritual practices.
* **He went there to ""āta whakaaro"" (meditate/contemplate).** This action inherently links to a desire for inner peace and focus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ka āwhina te haruru o waho ki te whakaaroaro (External noise helps with thinking):** The passage explicitly states the *lack* of noise is important.
* **C: He iti noa iho te wā e hiahiatia ana e ia (He needed very little time):** The passage doesn't mention the *duration* of his time in the cave, only that he *went* there.
* **D: I hiahia a ia kia kitea, kia rangona (He wanted to be seen, to be heard):** The description of the cave's isolation directly contradicts this; he *avoided* being seen or heard.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te rino i whakamahia mo te tuatahi?","The correct answer is **C: Wīra**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...nā te rino i kaha ake te taiākotikoti ki ngā wīra wāpu o ngā wēkana. Tāria te wā, i whakakapia ngā wīra rākau ki ngā wīra rino."" This translates to ""...iron made it more difficult for the flanged wheels of the wagons to dig in. Eventually, wooden rails were replaced with iron rails.""

Therefore, iron was first used for the **rails** (wīra).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā Whakawhitinga (Crossties):** Crossties were used to hold the rails in place, but the passage doesn't say iron was *first* used for them.
*   **B: Nga huarahi waka (Roadways):** Roadways are a general term and not what the iron was specifically applied to.
*   **D: Ngā rera (Tracks):** While ""rera"" can relate to tracks, the passage specifically mentions ""wīra"" (rails) being made of iron first.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha i whakakapia ai nga wīra rākau e nga wīra rino?","The correct answer is **C: Ka taea e rātau te whakahaere i ngā kawenga nui ake** (They could handle heavier loads).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nā te rino i kaha ake te taiākotikoti ki ngā wīra wāpu o ngā wēkana."" This translates to ""Because iron was more resistant to the wear and tear of the wagons.""  This directly implies the iron rails were stronger and could handle heavier loads compared to the wooden rails.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I piki ake te tere o ngā hoiho** (The speed of the horses increased) - While the passage mentions horses traveling faster *because* of the improved tracks, this isn't *why* the rails were changed.
*   **B: I whakaarotia he pai ake rātau** (They were considered better) -  The passage doesn't say they were simply ""considered better"", but highlights the practical benefit of increased durability.
*   **D: I te mau rātau i te rino i runga i nga ara** (They held the iron on the tracks) - This is incorrect; the crossties held the rails in place, not the rails themselves.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te āhua o te tangata i te wā o te Romanticism?","The correct answer is **B: Papawhenua**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...nā te takotoranga papa te tangata i aweawe..."" which translates to ""...the social structure overwhelmed the individual..."" and ""...e reretau ana ēnei ki te wāhi o te papori..."" which translates to ""...these are traced back to the place of the individual.""

This clearly indicates that the individual (tangata) was *overwhelmed* by social structure (takotoranga papa) and that the focus shifted *back* to the individual (papori).  Therefore, the passage describes the individual as being in a state of being overwhelmed or defined by their place within the social structure. ""Papawhenua"" best captures this sense of being subject to or defined by social context.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā Ture (Laws):** While laws are part of a social structure, the passage doesn't directly focus on laws themselves.
*   **C: Ngā Ritenga (Rituals):**  Rituals are cultural, but the passage focuses on the broader social structure.
*   **D: Ahurea (Culture):** Culture is too broad. The passage specifically discusses the impact of *social structure* on the individual.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā kīanga e whai ake nei e kore e whakaata i tētahi ariā whānui o te whakatau hangarau? ,"The correct answer is **D: Kāore te whanaketanga hangarau e hāngai ana ki te mana tōrangapū** (Technological development is not related to political power).

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

* **The passage *explicitly* states** that technological determinism posits technology develops *independently* of culture *and* political influence.  The passage even uses ""whakaaweawe tōrangapū"" (political influence) as an example of something technology is seen as separate from. Therefore, saying it *isn't* related to political power directly contradicts the core idea of technological determinism as presented.

Let's look at why the other options *do* reflect aspects of the passage:

* **A: Ko ngā pānga o te hangarau ki te hapori he āhuatanga pāpori** (The effects of technology on society are a superficial feature) - This aligns with the idea that technological determinism sees technology as having a fundamental and pervasive impact (""pānga"""" ā-roto tonu"") on society, not a superficial one.
* **B: Kāore te ahurea e whakaawe i te whanaketanga o te hangarau** (Culture does not influence the development of technology) - This is a central tenet of technological determinism as described in the text.  It states technology follows its own path, separate from cultural factors.
* **C: He pānga tūturu tō te hangarau ki te iwi** (Technology has a real impact on the people) - The passage highlights the ""pānga"" (impact) of technology on people and even societal norms (""heipūtanga o te tikanga ā-iwi"").



Therefore, **D** is the only option that *doesn't* align with the described principles of technological determinism.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i te pāhono ki te tō i te kopere?","The correct answer is **A: He oro ngohengohe ake** (A softer sound).

Here's why, based on the passage:

* **The passage states:** ""I te nuinga o te wā ka puta te oro māriri ake i tētahi kōpere-ki runga, kei kaha ake, rīrā ake ana te kōpere-ki raro."" (Usually a brighter sound comes from an 'upward stroke', a stronger, more resonant sound from a 'downward stroke').  This means upward strokes are *brighter* and downward strokes are *stronger*. A softer sound doesn't fit this description.

Let's look at why the other options *do* fit:

* **B: He tohu e āhua nei he tēpara** (A mark that looks like an inverted V) - The passage specifically states the downward stroke mark is ""tētahi tēpara"" (an inverted V).
* **C: He oro kaha ake** (A stronger sound) - As noted above, the passage says downward strokes produce a stronger sound.
* **D: Tīmata ana i te poroka** (Starting at the block) - The passage states downward strokes start ""ki te poraka"" (at the block).



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e pāhono ana ki te oro mārire ake?","The correct answer is **C: He tohu e āhua nei he V**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I te nuinga o te wā ka puta te oro māriri ake i tētahi kōpere-ki runga..."" which translates to ""Usually a brighter sound comes from a 'copper-up'...""  It then describes the ""copper-up"" as being shaped like a V.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He tohu kopere whakararo (A 'copper-down' sign):** The passage says the brighter sound comes from 'copper-up', not 'copper-down'.
* **B: E mau ana i te kopere (Holding the copper):** This describes *where* you start for a 'copper-down' strike, not what produces the brighter sound.
* **D: Ka tīmata i te wāhi e mau ana tō ringa i te aho (Starts where your hand holds the cord):**  Similar to B, this describes the starting point for 'copper-down'.



"
E whakaatu ana ngā kōhatu i ngā ringa i te mutunga ka huri hei whakamahi i te nuinga mō te aha?,"The correct answer is **A: Māwhai** (Tool use/Manipulation).

Here's why:

The passage states the finger bones (kōiwi mātātoko ringaringa) show a shift ""from manipulation to suspension."" This directly indicates the hands evolved *from* being used for fine motor skills (manipulation - like tool use) *to* being adapted for hanging/brachiation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: E mau ana i te taumahatanga** (Holding weight): While chimps use their hands for this *during* locomotion, the passage focuses on the *change* from that function.
*   **C: Locomotion:** The passage contrasts human hand use with chimpanzee locomotion (knuckle-walking).
*   **D: E haere ana a Knuckle** (Knuckle-walking): The passage highlights how human hands *differed* from knuckle-walking adaptations.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kōrero e tino whakaahua ana i ngā kōhao o te chimpanzee? ,"The correct answer is **B: He rerekē te rahi o ō rātou ringa me ō rātou waewae** (Their hands and feet are of different sizes).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He rite tahi te rahinga o te ringa me te waewae o te Chimpanzee"" (The chimpanzee has roughly the same length of hand and foot).  This directly relates to the *difference* in size between hands and feet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He hāngai ake rātau i te tangata** (They are more closely related to humans): While true, the passage doesn’t focus on their relationship to humans, but their physical characteristics.
*   **C: E whakamahia ana mō te mau taimaha** (They are used for carrying heavy things): The passage says they use their hands for supporting themselves *while walking* – not necessarily carrying heavy things.
*   **D: E whakamahia ana i te nuinga o te wā mō te whakahiato** (They are mostly used for climbing): While chimpanzees climb, the passage focuses on their hand/foot length and use during walking.



"
Ka tangohia e te tīpakonga ngā rerekētanga iranga hou mai i tēhea puna?,"The correct answer is **A: Hunaia** (the hidden).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...mā te irakē e tāpiri te rerenga ira hou, ā, mā te kōwhiringa e wewete mai i te puna o te rerenga e putaputa ana.""  This translates to ""...by coding new genetic information is added, and by selection the source of the emerging information is deciphered.""  The passage then specifies that this source is the ""huna"" (hidden) group.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pahekotanga** - This doesn't relate to the source of new genetic information in the passage.
* **C: Whakangao** - This relates to training/teaching, not genetics.
* **D: whakapuakina** - This means revealed/expressed, the opposite of the ""hidden"" source.



"
He aha te tukanga e whai mana ana ki te tāpiri i te rerekētanga iranga?,"The correct answer is **C: irakētanga**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mā te **irakē** e tāpiri te rerenga ira hou..."" This directly translates to ""Through **mutation** new genetic information is added...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Whakangao (Training):** This refers to learning or practice, not genetic change.
* **B: pahekotanga (Association):** This means connection or relationship, not the *process* of adding genetic variation.
* **D: whakapuakina (Expression):** This relates to *showing* a trait, not *creating* the variation itself.



Therefore, **irakētanga (mutation)** is the process described in the passage as adding new genetic information."
"I runga anō i te mōhiohio i roto i te wāhanga, ko tēhea o ēnei e tika ana kia kai te primate hei whakaoti i tētahi raruraru “raruraru pūmua”?","The correct answer is **B: Raw legumes**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te hua o te rākau e tino wātea ana ko ngā pūmua kei roto i ngā rau me ngā rākau pī, heoi he uaua mō ngā whāngote waewae-rua pēnei i a tātou te nakunaku i ēnei kai ki te kore e tunua.""  This translates to: ""Fruit is readily available and seeds are in leaves and pods, however it is difficult for primates like us to digest these foods without cooking."" 

The passage refers to ""raruraru pūmua"" (seed problem) and explains that seeds (found in pods - *rākau pī*, legumes) are a valuable food source but hard to digest raw. This directly connects legumes to the ""seed problem"" the primates face.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā rau mate (Dead leaves):** The passage doesn't mention dead leaves as a food source or solution to the ""seed problem.""
*   **C: Nga mawhitiwhiti (Insects):** The passage mentions insects as an easier-to-digest protein source (pōpokorua, ngārara, hēkī) but doesn’t link them to resolving a “seed problem”.
*   **D: Ngā tātā putiputi (Flower buds):** The passage doesn't discuss flower buds in relation to dietary difficulties or the seed problem.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā raruraru e whai ake nei kāore i te puta mai i te kore o ngā waikawa amino hira?","The correct answer is **C: tupu pōhara (poor growth)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Waihoki, ki te kore pērā ka taumaha ngā hua: ka pēhia te tipunga, ka ngoikore te taikaha, ā, nā wai rā ka hemo."" This translates to: ""Also, if not, the fruits become heavy: the seed is crushed, the stem is weak, and then it dies."" This describes *poor growth* and ultimately death of the plant due to a lack of essential amino acids.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā raruraru o te whangai (Feeding problems):** The passage discusses difficulties in *digesting* food (specifically plant matter) without cooking, related to accessing the nutrients within. This is a different issue than simply *finding* food.
* **B: Te mate o te kai (Food spoilage):**  The passage doesn't mention food spoiling. It focuses on the difficulty of *extracting* nutrients from the food.
* **D: Mate (Death):** While the passage mentions death (of the plant), it specifically links this to the *cause* being the crushed seed and weak stem, stemming from a lack of amino acids – which is related to poor growth.  Death is a *result* of the problem, not the problem itself.



Therefore, **tupu pōhara (poor growth)** is the direct consequence of insufficient amino acids as described in the passage."
Me pēhea te tikanga o ngā mema o tētahi ahurea iti ki te tohu i tō rātou hononga ki taua rōpū?,"The correct answer is **D: Mā te whakamahi i te kāhua hei momo tohu** (By using style as a kind of signal).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""He auau te tohu a ngā mema o tētahi ahurea āpiti i tā rātou whai wāhitanga mā tētahi whakamahinga āhua he rerekē, he tohu, kei roto ko ngā āhua, ngā tū, ko ngā huinga kupu."" This translates to: ""Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinct use of style, a sign including appearances, postures, and vocabulary.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mā te ngana ki te whakaranu ki** (By trying to translate to) - This doesn't relate to signaling group affiliation.
* **B: Mā te tango i ngā whakapono o te katoa e karapoti ana i a rātau** (By taking the beliefs of everyone who qualifies with them) - While shared beliefs are important, the passage focuses on *visible* signals.
* **C: Mā te whakaae ki ngā tikanga pāpori** (By agreeing with mainstream customs) - Subcultures often *differentiate* themselves from mainstream customs, not agree with them.

"E ai ki te ariā e whakaaturia ana i roto i te wāhanga, he aha te mea ka tupu ki te tamaiti e tohu ana ki te iwi iti e whakaarohia ana mo te mahi i te whanonga whakawehi?","The correct answer is **B: Ka nui ake pea te tūponotanga o te tamaiti ki te whanonga whakawehi.**

Here's why:

The passage states that children identified with a minority group expected to underperform *often* do better in school *when they are made aware of their group's potential*. This implies the initial expectation (the stereotype threat) negatively impacts performance.  Being aware of positive potential *increases* their performance, suggesting they are more likely to embrace and perform *to* the expected positive outcome.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ka ngana te tamaiti ki te karo i te mahi whakawehi:** The passage doesn't say they avoid it, but rather that their performance *changes* when aware of their potential.
*   **C: Ka whakakahore te tamaiti i ngā āhuatanga pāpori:** The passage focuses on performance, not rejecting societal traits.
*   **D: Ka whakakahore te tamaiti ki te mahi tahi me ētahi atu iwi iti:** The passage doesn't mention anything about avoiding interaction with other minority groups.



"
"E ai ki te whārangi, ko te mōhio o te tamaiti ki ngā āhuatanga ā-iwi ka whai pānga ki tēhea o ēnei?","The correct answer is **B: to rātau whanonga (their behaviour/style)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that seeing different types of people and stereotypes can *affect behaviour*. It specifically gives the example of children identified with a minority group who, when aware of the stereotype about their group performing poorly in school, actually *do better* when they're made aware of the stereotype.  This demonstrates a direct impact of awareness of group identity on *how they behave* (in this case, how they perform in school).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ko te iwi iti e whiriwhiria ana e rātau hei tohu (The minority group they are chosen to represent):** The passage doesn't talk about children representing groups, but rather *being identified* *with* a group.
* **C: Ko ō rātou hononga ki ētahi atu tamariki (Their relationships with other children):** The passage doesn't mention relationships with other children.
* **D: Ko tā rātou tautuhinga o te iwi (Their identification with the tribe):** While awareness of their group is important, the passage focuses on the impact on *behaviour*, not just on how strongly they identify with the group.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tehea o ēnei e kore e ōrite ki te whakatipu i tētahi tamaiti mohoao?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā pūkenga kōrerorero kaha (Strong communication skills)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes ""feral children"" (mohoao) as often exhibiting *lack* of social skills and human connection. They may have difficulty with communication due to lack of interaction with other humans.  The passage specifically mentions fear and lack of regard for people. 

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with what the passage says about feral children:

*   **A: Noho takitahi ana (Being solitary):** The passage states some feral children ""lived alone.""
*   **C: Ngā āhuatanga tārewa (Animalistic features):** The passage describes children raised by animals exhibiting animal-like behaviors.
*   **D: Te māharahara pāpori (Extreme fearfulness):** The passage mentions fear as a characteristic of feral children.



Therefore, strong communication skills would *not* be a characteristic of a child raised in isolation as described in the passage."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kupu e whai ake nei e whakaahua tika ana i te whanonga mohoao o ngā tamariki?","The correct answer is **A: Ko te nuinga o te whanonga feral i takea mai i te āhuatanga ōkiko** (Most feral behavior stems from physical characteristics).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ina whakatipuria katoatia e te kararehe ehara i te tangata, ka whakaatu te tamaiti mohoao i ngā whanonga (i roto tonu i ngā here ā-kiko) kei te pērā katoa i ērā o te kararehe-tiaki ake, pērā i tana mataku, tana kore aro rānei ki te tangata.""  This directly translates to: ""When raised entirely by animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (often physical ones) that are very similar to those of the animal that raised them, such as their fear or lack of attention to humans.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ko te whanonga mohoao ka puta mai i te kore o te whakahoahoa** (Feral behavior arises from a lack of socialization) - While lack of socialization *contributes* to feral behavior, the passage specifically highlights the *physical* development mirroring the animal caregiver.
* **C: Ko te whanonga mohoao e tino kitea ana i roto i ngā tamariki kua herea e ō rātou mātua** (Feral behavior is most evident in children who have been restrained by their parents) -  Restraint (being tied up) is mentioned as *one* cause of trauma, but not the defining characteristic of feral behavior.
* **D: Ko ngā whanonga mohoao katoa e pā ana ki ngā ngoikoretanga hinengaro nui** (All feral behaviors are related to major mental disabilities) - The passage mentions potential psychological trauma *before* abandonment, but doesn't state all feral behavior stems from mental disability.  The physical mirroring of animal behavior is a key point.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that subsistence farming (ahuwhenua mō te hapori) is focused on growing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.  Selling crops for profit is *not* a characteristic of this type of farming.

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with the passage:

* **A: Te arotahi ki te hua e tutuki ai ngā hiahia o te whānau ahuwhenua (Focusing on produce to meet the needs of the farming family):** This is *exactly* what the passage defines subsistence farming as.
* **C: Te arotahi ki te hua nui hei utu mō ngā tikanga matatau (Focusing on large yields at the expense of sophisticated methods):** The passage describes agroecological farming as simple, often traditional, and focusing on maximizing output within those constraints.
* **D: E mau kākano ana ki te rohe o te kaiahuwhenua (Saving seeds from the farmer's region):**  The passage states agroecological farming often uses native seeds.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whakaahua tika ana i te mahi ahuwhenua?,"The correct answer is **D: E whakamahia tonu ana e ngā kaiahuwhenua i ētahi whenua.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""I mua i te whai wāhi te nuinga o ngā kaipāmu ki te ahuwhenua whāngai i a rātou anō, ā, e pēnei tonu ana ki ngā tini whenua e whanake ana."" (Previously most farmers practiced agriculture to feed themselves and their families, and it is still like that in many developing countries.) This directly supports the idea that farmers continue to use agriculture in certain areas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He pūnaha tino rauropi (A very complex system):** The passage describes ahuwhenua-tiaki-ake as a *māmā* (simple) system.
* **B: E whakamahi ana i ngā tikanga ahurei hei whakanui i ngā hua (Using innovative methods to increase yields):** While increasing yields is a goal, the passage emphasizes simplicity and traditional methods (""kākano māori"" - traditional seeds).
* **C: Ka āhei te hunga ahuwhenua ki te tohatoha i ō rātou hua puta noa i tō rātou rohe (Farmers are able to distribute their produce throughout their region):** The passage focuses on self-sufficiency and feeding the farmer’s family, not wider distribution.

Ko te haere ki tētahi whare taonga ka uru ki roto ki te momo tūruhi?,"The correct answer is **C: tāpoi ahurea**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mehemea ko te whāinga o te toronga ki tētahi wāhi ko te whai mōhio e pā ana ki tana hītori, ki tana ahurea, kei te mōhiotia tēnei momo tāpoi hei tāpoi ahurea."" (If the purpose of traveling to a place is to gain knowledge about its history, its culture, then this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.)

Visiting a museum is directly related to gaining knowledge about history and culture. Therefore, it falls under the definition of *tāpoi ahurea* (cultural tourism).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te tūruhi pakihi** (Business tourism) - This is related to work, not leisure and cultural learning.
*   **B: Turuhi whakangahau** (Recreational tourism) - While museums can be recreational, the passage specifically links cultural learning to *tāpoi ahurea*.
*   **D: Te tūruhi o waho** (Adventure tourism) - This involves activities like hiking, climbing, or exploring wild environments, which isn't the focus of visiting a museum.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha pea te mea tuatahi mo te hunga haere whakangahau?","The correct answer is **B: E okioki ana i a rātau mahi o ia rā.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Koinei tā te tangata haere ki tētahi wāhi he tino rerekē i ā rātou mahi o ia rā hei whakatā, hei ngahau.""  This translates to: ""This is people going to a place very different from their everyday lives for relaxation, for fun."" 

This directly indicates that a primary aspect of recreational travel (the type being described) is *breaking away* from one's daily routine.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te whakauru ki te ahurea o te rohe (Immersion in the culture of the area):** While cultural tourism is *mentioned* as a separate type of travel, it's not the primary focus of the initial description of recreational tourism.
*   **C: Kei te kite i ngā tohutohu hira (Seeing famous landmarks):**  The passage mentions landmarks as something cultural tourists *might* do, but not as the defining characteristic of recreational travel.
*   **D: Te mārama ki te hītori o tētahi wāhi (Understanding the history of a place):**  Similar to C, history is related to cultural tourism, not the core of recreational tourism as described in the first sentence.

He aha te mea e whakahuatia ana i roto i te wāhanga hei mea i āwhina ki te whakaiti i te wehi ki te huringa i roto i te hahi o te rohe?,"The correct answer is **A: Te maumahara ki ngā tauira angitu o te whanonga pakihi** (Remembering successful examples of business practices).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nā ngā kōrero angitu pēnei i heke haere ngā mataku mō te panoni, waihoki ka hangaia ngā aronga pai ki te panoni mō te wā e heke mai ana.""  This directly translates to ""Successful stories like these reduced the fear of change, and also created positive attitudes towards change for the future.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Te whiwhi mōhiohio mō ngā tāngata i pānga ki te ahurea o te whakahaere** (Gaining knowledge about people who impacted the organizational culture) - While important for understanding history, the passage specifically links *successful stories* to reduced fear.
* **C: Te kitenga i ngā pūmana akiaki o te whakahaere** (Identifying the driving forces of the organization) -  This is a broader concept discussed, but not directly tied to reducing fear of change.
* **D: Mā te mōhio ki te hītori o te whakahaere** (By knowing the history of the organization) - Knowing history is helpful, but it's the *successful examples* within that history that specifically alleviate fear.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te āwhina o te mōhio ki te hītori o tētahi?","The correct answer is **A: Te whakaiti i te wehi ki te huringa (Reducing fear of change)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nā ngā kōrero angitu pēnei i heke haere ngā mataku mō te panoni..."" which translates to ""Successful stories like these reduced the fear of change..."".  This directly links understanding history to lessening fear around new initiatives.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Whakakaha ana i ngā uara (Strengthening values):** While understanding history *can* reinforce values, the passage focuses more on overcoming fear of change.
* **C: Te kimi i tētahi wāhi i roto i te whakahaere (Finding a place within the organization):** The passage mentions understanding *where you fit* in the history of the organization, but it's a consequence of understanding history, not the primary benefit.
* **D: Te whakapai ake i te whanonga pakihi (Improving business practices):**  The passage talks about learning from successes and failures, which *could* improve practices, but the primary emphasis is on the psychological impact of understanding the past.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e whakaahua tika ana i te huarahi whai muri o te mātauranga?,"The correct answer is **D: Kāore he tino tikanga i roto i te ako** (There is no single correct way to learn).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ehara i te mea kotahi anake te ara pai hei ako."" (There isn't only one good way to learn.) and ""kāore tētahi mea pai hei ako"" (there isn't one thing that is good to learn). This directly supports the idea that there's no single ""right"" approach to education.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He pai ake ētahi wheako ako i ētahi** (Some learning experiences are better than others) - While possibly true, this doesn’t capture the *core* postmodern argument against a fixed, hierarchical view of knowledge. The passage is more about rejecting the idea of a *single* best way or *single* important thing to learn.
* **B: Me arotahi te ako ki ngā mea e whakapono ana tātou ka wheako** (Learning should focus on what we believe we will experience) - This isn’t supported by the text. The passage focuses on the *creation* of knowledge through experience, not pre-selecting experiences based on belief.
* **C: He pai ake ētahi huarahi ako i ētahi atu** (Some learning methods are better than others) - Similar to A, this implies a hierarchy that the passage rejects.



The passage's example of watching TV shows about experiences you don't actually *have* illustrates the postmodern point:  knowledge isn't inherently valuable just because it's *presented*; its value comes from the interaction between the learner and the knowledge, and the individual's experience shaping that knowledge.  This underlines the rejection of a fixed, universal standard for learning."
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e kore e whakaatu tika ana i tētahi huarahi ako whai muri i te ao hou?,"The correct answer is **D: Ko te mātauranga e kore pea e taea te whakamahi, he mea tika tonu kia ako.**

Here's why:

* **The passage strongly criticizes learning that *doesn't* lead to application or experience.** The entire point is that passively receiving information (like watching TV shows about things you never do) is a flawed approach to learning, according to a postmodern perspective. The passage emphasizes the importance of *doing* and *experiencing* to truly learn.

Let's look at why the other options *do* align with the postmodern approach described in the passage:

* **A: He maha ngā huarahi ako mōhiohio (There are many ways to learn):** This directly reflects the passage's statement that there isn't one ""right"" way to learn.
* **B: Me matua whakawhiwhia ētahi wheako ako ki ētahi atu (Some learning experiences must be connected to others):**  The passage emphasizes learning as a dynamic interaction between learner and knowledge, implying connection and integration.
* **C: Ko te wheako ako e whakawhirinaki ana ki te ākonga me te mātauranga i whakaaturia (Learning experience depends on the student and the presented knowledge):**  This accurately captures the passage's focus on the co-creation of learning through experience.



Therefore, option D is the only one that contradicts the core argument of the passage.  The passage argues *against* valuing knowledge that isn't applied or experienced."
"I muri i te whakaoho i te wā o te moe noa, ko tēhea o ēnei e ārai i te tukanga whakaware i te moe?","The correct answer is **C: Whakaweto ana i te pūoho i tō pō, a, ka hoki whakamuri ki te moe e rua tekau meneti ā muri ake** (Getting out of bed at night, and going back to sleep twenty minutes later).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Ki te kite koe i tō whakarite anō i te karaka i te wā e moe ana koe, ka taea te whakatakoto ki tērā atu taha o te rūma, hei reira koe me peke atu i te moenga hei weto."" This translates to: ""If you find yourself resetting the alarm while sleeping, you can place it on the other side of the room, so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.""  This action *disrupts* the easy return to sleep and makes it harder to fall back asleep immediately.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pānui mō te haora me te hawhe i mua i te hoki ki te moe** (Reading for an hour and a half before going back to sleep) - This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **B: Te whakamahi i te wharepaku, me te hoki tonu ki te moenga** (Using the bathroom, and immediately going back to bed) -  While using the bathroom might happen, the passage doesn't suggest it's a technique to *prevent* falling back asleep too easily.
* **D: Te whakaara ake ki te inu wai i te ipu i runga i tō tēpu po** (Waking up to drink water from a glass on your bedside table) - The passage mentions drinking fluids *before* bed to encourage waking to urinate, not as a strategy *after* waking during the night.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei kōrero e kore e tika te whakaahua i te whakaware i te moe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka taea te hanga i runga anō i te biorhythm**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a specific technique called ""wake back to bed"" (or a variation of it).** It's about *intentionally* waking yourself up briefly and then going back to sleep. It doesn't mention anything about aligning with or adjusting your natural biorhythm.  In fact, it's *working against* your immediate sleep drive.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **B: Ko te whāinga kia kore koe e tino oho** - (The goal is to not fully wake up) - This is true. The text says to use a gentle alarm to wake you to ""awareness without full awakening.""
* **C: Ka puta te tukanga i roto i tō wā moe noa** - (The process happens during your normal sleep time) - The passage explicitly states the waking happens during the normal course of sleep.
* **D: Whai muri i te whakaara, ko te whāinga kia moe anō i roto i ngā haora e rua** - (After waking, the goal is to fall back asleep within two hours) - The text mentions a short return to sleep (10-60 minutes), which fits within the two-hour timeframe.

"I te mea e ngana ana te roro ki te moemoea mārama i te nuinga o te wā, he aha te mea ka nui ake?","The correct answer is **D: Wā i waenga i ngā āhuatanga REM**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ko te take matua mō tēnei āhuatanga ko te hua o ngā moemoeā mārama e whakaroa ana i te roanga o te wā i waenga i ngā āhuatanga REM."" (The main reason for this feature is the result of lucid dreams lengthening the time between REM stages.)

Therefore, if the brain is *trying* to have lucid dreams frequently, it will lead to a *longer* time between REM stages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nuinga o ngā tūnga REM (Number of REM stages)** - The passage implies a *decrease* in REM stages, not an increase.
*   **B: Ngā taumata pūngao (Stress levels)** - The passage doesn't mention stress levels.
*   **C: Roa o te āhua whakaora (Length of restorative phase)** - While sleep quality is discussed, the passage doesn't directly link lucid dream attempts to the length of restorative phases.



"
Ko tehea o ngā pānga kino e whai ake nei ka pā ki te tinana i ngā moemoea mārama maha?,"The correct answer is **B: Te heke o te REM ia pō** (The decrease of REM each night).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I runga i te hekenga iho o ngā REM ia pō, ko tēnei āhua ka tino pāngia koe e te moe tūturu..."" (Based on the decrease of REM each night, this phenomenon will significantly affect your deep sleep...).  The text directly links frequent lucid dreams to a *reduction* in REM sleep.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He iti ake te roa o te wā i waenganui i ngā āhua REM** (A shorter time between REM phases): The passage actually says lucid dreams *lengthen* the time between REM phases.
* **C: E ai ki te moemoeā lucid** (According to the lucid dream): This isn't a consequence *of* lucid dreams, it's a description *of* them.
* **D: Ngā REMs nui ake i ia pō** (More REMs each night): The passage states the opposite - REM decreases.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te ōritetanga o ngā kapa tuku iho me ngā kapa mariko?","The correct answer is **A: E tūmanakohia ana kia mahi ngā kapa e rua i te taumata kotahi.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""E mau nei te taumata kōunga mō ngā roopū mariko ki ngā tīma taketake, heoi he rerekētanga iti nei.""  This translates to ""The aspiration level for virtual teams is the same as for traditional teams, however there is a slight difference.""  This directly indicates an expectation that both types of teams *should* operate at the same level.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage *describes a difference* in autonomy - virtual teams often have *more* autonomy.
* **C:** The ""invisible team"" concept applies specifically to *virtual* teams, not traditional ones.
* **D:** The passage mentions different time zones as a potential challenge for virtual teams, implying they *don't* necessarily work within the same time frame.



"
"I runga anō i te wāhanga nei, he teka te kōrero e pā ana ki ngā rōpū tūturu me ngā rōpū tūturu?","The correct answer is **B: He maha ngā wā e mahi ana ngā rōpū mariko hei wāhi whakapā mō ngā rōpū tuku iho** (Often, virtual teams act as a communication point for traditional teams).

Here's why:

The passage states: *""I ētahi wā ka noho ngā mema tīma mariko hei āhuatanga whakapākanga mō tō rātou rōpū ā-kiko tata.""*  This directly translates to ""Sometimes virtual team members act as a communication feature for their physical team.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage states the *opposite* - virtual teams often have *more* autonomy.
* **C:** Again, the passage states the *opposite* - virtual teams have *more* autonomy.
* **D:** While the passage mentions differing time zones are a factor, it doesn't say virtual teams *benefit* from this difference, only that it can create challenges for managers.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te mea e arotahi ana ki ngā ariā ihirangi?,"The correct answer is **A: E hiahia ana te hōu kia whai rawa i te pakeketanga** (New employees needing to have resources for development).

Here's why:

The passage focuses on *motivating factors* in the workplace – what drives people, their needs, and how their environment impacts their work.  Let's break down why the other options *are* related to the passage:

* **B: Me pēhea te pānga o te taiao ki ngā mahi** (How the environment affects actions) - The passage explicitly states that the areas focus on how surroundings influence whether people act or not.
* **C: Ngā hiahia ā-roto** (Internal needs) -  The passage discusses desires and needs ingrained in people as they mature.
* **D: Te mārama ki ngā hiahia o te iwi** (Understanding people's needs) -  The entire passage is about identifying what motivates people.

However, **A** is about providing *resources for new employees*. While important for employee *retention* and *growth*, it's not directly about the core *motivating factors* the passage defines. The passage isn’t about setting up new employees, but *understanding* what already motivates people.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te kaupapa o te ture o ngā tuatoru?,"The correct answer is **A: Te waihanga i tētahi raina taketake mō te wāhi e taea ai te tūnga** (Creating a baseline for where things can be placed).

Here's why:

The passage describes the ""rule of thirds"" as a guide that *creates excitement* while *maintaining a sense of balance* by placing the main subject at the intersections of lines that divide the image into thirds.  It's about composition and visual interest.

Let's look at why the other options *are* part of the rule of thirds:

* **B: Te hanga ora me te pūngao i roto i tētahi whakaahua** (Creating life and energy in a photograph) - The rule of thirds aims to do this by making the image more visually engaging than simply centering the subject.
* **C: Te pupuri i te kaupapa ki tētahi wāhi motuhake, whai hua hoki** (Keeping the subject in a special, effective place) -  This is the core of the rule - placing the subject off-center at an intersection point.
* **D: Whakatū ana i te raupapa i roto i tētahi whakaahua** (Establishing order in a photograph) -  The grid created by the rule of thirds helps to organize the elements within the image.

Option A, however, speaks to a *starting point* for layout, but isn’t the *goal* of the rule of thirds. The rule isn't about establishing a baseline, it's about *deviating* from a centered baseline to create a more dynamic composition.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore e whakaahua i te hōputu whakaahua 35mm?,"The correct answer is **D: Ko te hōputu tino pūnoa tēnei i te ao** (This is the most common format in the world).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** While 35mm is being perpetuated now, it's fundamentally derived from the aspect ratios of film cameras. It's described as having dimensions of 36mm wide and 24mm tall, resulting in a 3:2 aspect ratio.
* **Option D is incorrect** because the passage implies 35mm *came from* earlier formats, and is now widely used. It isn't the original or most basic format, but one that developed.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Kei te whakanao tonu** (Is being perpetuated now) - The text explicitly states this.
* **B: I tangohia e ngā hōputu kāmera matihiko** (Was adopted by digital camera formats) - The text says 35mm's aspect ratio was adopted *from* film camera formats.
* **C: He rerekē te ōwehenga o ngā āhuatanga i te nuinga o ngā hōputu noa** (The aspect ratio of features differs from most common formats) - The passage highlights the 3:2 aspect ratio.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i te mea e whakapiki ana ngā kaiwhakanao i te kounga o te hanga i ngā karu, he pēhea te whakapai ake i ngā karu whakaata?","The correct answer is **C: He ōrite te kounga whakaahua o rātau ki ngā arotahi me te tawhiti arotahi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mā tēnei ka āhei ngā karaehe topa mō ngā pikitia ki tētahi momo kounga e rite ana ki ērā karaehe e hōmiromiro ana.""  This translates to: ""This allows top lenses for pictures to achieve a quality comparable to those lenses that are mirroring.""  This directly means the quality of the images from these lenses is becoming *equal* to those of more expensive, traditional lenses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He tere ake ō rātou arotahi** - The passage mentions speed (tere) in relation to the sensor size, not the focus speed of the lenses themselves.
*   **B: He māmā ake te whakamahi i roto i ngā āhuatanga marama iti** - The passage does mention difficulty with cheaper lenses and low-light conditions, implying the opposite - they are *harder* to use in low light.
*   **D: He iti ake te matatini o te arotahi i ngā karu matua** - The passage suggests the opposite – close-focus lenses require *more* focus features to achieve a wider range of focus points.



"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i roto i te wāhanga, i te wā e pai ake ai te arotahi whakaata i te arotahi matua?","The correct answer is **A: Mēnā he mea matua te kōpae nui rawa**.

Here's why:

The passage states that close-focus lenses (arotahi whakatata) require a greater depth of field to achieve sharpness across a wider range of focus points than standard lenses.  This is because manufacturers are improving the quality of lens elements, allowing for higher quality images with close-focus lenses, *approaching the quality of mirrored lenses*.  A large aperture (kōpae nui rawa) contributes to a shallower depth of field, which is what you need to achieve this effect with a close-focus lens.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mēnā e hiahia ana koe kia iti iho ngā huānga arotahi:** The passage actually says close-focus lenses *require* more focus elements.
* **C: Mēnā kāore koe e hiahia ki te whakamahi i te flash i ngā tautuhinga pōuri ake:**  The passage doesn't mention flash.
* **D: Mēnā e rapu ana koe i te uaua ake o te arotahi:** The passage discusses image quality and depth of field, not necessarily the difficulty of focusing.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e kore e kiia he whakaahuatanga tika o te Mysticism?,"The correct answer is **A: He arotahi ki te wheako i ngā āhua rangimarie me te hari o te hinengaro (Focus on experiencing states of peace and mental bliss)**.

Here's why:

The passage defines mysticism as seeking *unity, identity, understanding* of a spiritual reality, God, or divine powers. It emphasizes *experience, inner knowing, and ethical understanding* of the true realm of spirits/the divine.  While peace and bliss *might* be *byproducts* of mystical experience, they aren't the *core pursuit* itself.  Mysticism is about a deeper, more fundamental connection and understanding.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: E rapu ana ngā kaiārahi o te Mysticism i tētahi mōhiotanga mōhio ki tētahi pono wairua (Mystics seek an informed knowledge of a spiritual truth)** - The passage states they seek ""māramatanga"" (understanding) of a spiritual reality.
* **C: E rapu ana nga kaiwhaiwhai o te Mysticism i te mōhiotanga o te pono wairua (Followers of Mysticism seek knowledge of spiritual truth)** -  This aligns with the core pursuit described in the passage.
* **D: Ko te aro nui ki te rapu wheako whaiaro he rite ki etahi atu momo whakapono me te karakia (A focus on seeking meaningful experiences is similar to other forms of belief and prayer)** - The passage acknowledges that mystical practices can differ from organized religion but still involve seeking experiences.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te kaupapa o te Mysticism?","The correct answer is **B: Te whai i te mātauranga mā ngā wheako o te hapori (Seeking knowledge through communal experiences)**.

Here's why:

The passage defines mysticism as a *personal* pursuit of unity, identity, understanding, or connection with a spiritual reality, power, truth, or a divine being. It emphasizes *individual* experience, inner knowing, and ethical insight into the true world of spirits/the divine.

Option B focuses on communal experiences. While spirituality can be shared, the passage describes mysticism as a deeply *individual* journey. The other options align with the passage's description:

*   **A: Te rapu i te whakaaro ki te ao atua (Seeking insight into the divine world)** - Directly relates to the search for understanding of the divine.
*   **C: He arotahi ki te āhua hari o te hinengaro (A focus on the ecstatic state of mind)** - The passage mentions joy/ecstasy (""e hīkaka ana te āhua"") as potentially part of the experience.
*   **D: Te whai i te mōhio ki te Atua (Seeking knowledge of God)** -  Explicitly mentioned as a goal of the mystic (""te mōhio ā-roto, i te māramatanga tōtika rānei ki te ao tūturu o ngā atua/te atua"").



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, tērā pea i tīmataria he iwi ahuwhenua?","The correct answer is **A: Moriori mai i Aotearoa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ka whakatū te ariā i te whakaaro i heke mai te hunga Māori i Poronīhia ki tētahi Kahupapa Nui, ā, ka tango i Aotearoa mai i ngā Moriori, me te whakatū i tētahi papori ahuwhenua."" 

This translates to: ""...the theory arose that the Māori came from Polynesia on a Great Fleet, and took Aotearoa from the Moriori, and established an agricultural society.""

Therefore, according to this section, the Moriori were the people who *were* taken over and whose land was then used to establish agriculture, implying they weren't already an agricultural people.  The passage *later* suggests a more nuanced relationship and the Moriori developing their own distinct culture, but the initial statement points to them being displaced by an agricultural group (Māori).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Moriori mai i ngā Moutere o Chatham:** While the Moriori *ended up* on the Chatham Islands (Rēkohu), the passage doesn't initially state they started there. It states they were in Aotearoa first.
* **C: Māori ngā tāngata o Polynesia:** The passage mentions Māori coming *from* Polynesia, but doesn't say they were the ones who initially started agriculture in Aotearoa.
* **D: Māori i te tuawhenua:** The passage suggests the Moriori were the original inhabitants (te tuawhenua) before the arrival of the Māori.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko te rōpū i rapu i te moa ko nga tangata tuatahi o tēhea tauwāhi?","The correct answer is **B: Aotearoa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mō te wā roa, i te rautau 19 me te rautau 20, e whakaponotia ana ko te iwi tuatahi ki **Aotearoa** ko te iwi Māori, i aruaru ai rātou te manu nui e kīa ana ko te Moa."" 

This directly translates to: ""For a long time, in the 19th and 20th centuries, it was believed that the first people to **Aotearoa** were the Māori, who hunted the large bird known as the Moa.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te tuawhenua** - While the passage discusses origins and movement *from* the mainland, it doesn't say the Moa hunting group *originated* from the mainland.
*   **C: Ngā Moutere o Chatham** - The passage discusses the Moriori people who lived on the Chatham Islands (Rēkohu), but not as the original hunters of the Moa.
*   **D: Polynesia** - The passage mentions Polynesian origins as a later theory regarding Māori arrival, but not in connection to the original Moa hunters.

I roto i tehea āhuatanga ka whai hua te whakamahi i te tikanga Pureland o te origami ki te kōpaki?,"The correct answer is **B: He pūkenga mīhini arā atu anō tā te kōpaki**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Pureland origami was developed to help people with limited dexterity.**  Robotics (machines) often have limitations in fine motor skills and dexterity. Pureland origami's restriction to single folds and pre-creased paper simplifies the folding process, making it more suitable for a machine to execute.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E pai ana te kōpaki ki te hanga i ngā takai maha i te wā kotahi** - The passage specifically states Pureland origami *doesn't* allow for multiple folds at once.
* **C: Kei te waihangahia e te kōpaki he origami e hiahia ana ki te takai whakamuri** - The passage doesn't mention anything about needing to reverse folds.
* **D: Kotahi, e rua rānei ngā wā i whakamātauria e te kōpaki i mua i** - The passage doesn't discuss testing iterations.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e kore e tika te whakaahua i te Pureland origami?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **B: Kāore te aratuka e whakauru ana i ngā takai whakamuri**.

I kōrero ai te Pūrongo ko te Pureland origami e hiahiatia ana he wāhi waingohia kei te katoa o ngā numi, ā, kaore i te whakaaetia ngā numi pīroiroi ake, pērā i ngā numi angamate. Ko te ""takai whakamuri"" (reverse folds) he āhuatanga o ngā numi pīroiroi, no reira kāore e taea te whakamāori i te Pureland origami.

*   **C: me whai tauwāhi tika ngā kōpaki** - E hiahiatia ana e te Pureland origami te tauwāhi tika.
*   **D: He tikanga pai mō ngā kōpaki me ngā pūkenga nekeneke iti** - I whanaketia e John Smith hei āwhina i ngā kaipōkai torehuruhuru me ngā pūkenga nekeneke iti."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea tauwāhi kāore i te pāhono ki te Tūmatanuitanga o te Awaawa o Indus?","The correct answer is **C: Ngā rohe katoa i Afghanistan ki te raki-māraki (All regions of Afghanistan in the northeast)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Indus Valley Civilization was located in areas encompassing most of present-day Pakistan and some regions in northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan. However, it doesn’t state that *all* regions of Afghanistan were part of it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Harappa:** The passage explicitly mentions Harappa as the first site excavated and a namesake for the civilization (Harappan Civilization).
*   **B: Te Awa o Sarasvati (Sarasvati River):** The passage discusses the Sarasvati River and the theory that the civilization flourished there, even suggesting the name “Indus-Sarasvati Civilization”.
*   **D: Te nuinga o Pakistan i tēnei rā (Most of Pakistan today):** The passage states the civilization was located in most of present-day Pakistan.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i whakahuatia hei ingoa pea mō te Bronze Age Civilization e kōrerotia ana i te wāhanga nei?,"The correct answer is **D: Te Whanaketanga o te Raorao o Indus**.

Here's why:

*   **P:** states the civilization is referred to as the **Indus Valley Civilization**, the **Indus-Sarasvati Civilization**, and the **Harappan Civilization**.
*   **A: Te Iwi o Harappan** – ""Harappan Civilization"" is explicitly mentioned.
*   **B: Te Whanaketanga Indus-Sarasvati** – ""Indus-Sarasvati Civilization"" is explicitly mentioned.
*   **C: Te Whanaketanga o te Awa o Indus** – This is a direct translation of ""Indus Valley Civilization"".
*   **D: Te Whanaketanga o te Raorao o Indus** – This translates to ""Indus Bronze Age Civilization,"" which isn’t a name directly used in the passage. While it *describes* the civilization, it isn't a name *for* it.

Therefore, **Te Whanaketanga o te Raorao o Indus** is the only option not presented as a possible name for the civilization in the provided text."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he painga roa?","The correct answer is **A: mahi tahi me ētahi atu** (working together with others).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te tūmanako, ka whai mōhio te nuinga o ngā tāngata ko tā rātou kōwhiringa wā roa pai rawa ko te mahi ngātahi ki ētahi atu.""  This translates to: ""It is hoped that most people will realize that their best long-term choice is to work together with others.""  This directly identifies collaborative work as the long-term benefit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kei te manakē i ngā painga whaiaro o te tangata** (Enjoying the immediate benefits of the individual) - The passage acknowledges immediate benefits, but argues long-term benefits come from cooperation, not solely individual gain.
* **C: Te whakanui i te mea e whai hua ai te tokoiti i te nuinga** (Increasing what benefits the few at the expense of the many) - The passage advocates *against* this, promoting benefit for *all* through cooperation.
* **D: Mā te mōhio ka whai hua pea te apo** (Knowing that selfishness may be beneficial) - The passage doesn’t state selfishness *will* be beneficial, and ultimately argues against it as a long-term strategy.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ka manakē pea tētahi tangata mēnā kei runga i ngā painga inamata tō rātou arotahi?","The correct answer is **C: Mahi Tahi (Collaboration)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the long-term benefits of working together.** It states that the greatest benefits come when even a small number of insightful people benefit from these advantages, and ultimately hopes people realize their best long-term choice is to collaborate.
* **""Mahi Tahi"" directly translates to ""Collaboration"" or ""Working Together"".**
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **A: kore noa iho (simply no)** - The passage is optimistic and suggests positive outcomes, not a negation.
    * **B: Ngātahitanga (Unity)** - While related to collaboration, the passage specifically points to the *action* of working together, not just the state of being unified.
    * **D: Whaiarotanga (Well-being/Prosperity)** - This is a *result* of collaboration, not the action itself that the passage highlights.

Therefore, the passage suggests that someone focused on long-term advantages would likely pursue **Mahi Tahi (Collaboration)**."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nāna i hipa tētahi wāhanga nui o nga utu whawhai?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā pēke tiriti o Wall** (Wall Street banks).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kia utu tāke ki te whakahaere koroniara o Ngā Whenua Tōpū o Amerika hei tuku pūtea hei utu i tētahi wāhanga nui o ngā utu me te itareti o ngā hononga-moni kua whakarewaina ki te ingoa o te kāwanatanga Piripīni mā ngā whare pēke o Wall Street.""

This translates to: ""...to pay taxes to the colonial administration of the United States to provide funds to pay off a large portion of the war costs and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banks.""

Therefore, Wall Street banks are the ones who financed a large portion of the war costs through bonds.



"
He aha te wā i mua i te wā o nga Templars?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā Pakeke o Waenganui tōmuri** (The Early Middle Ages).

The passage states: ""I mua i te High Middle Ages ko te Early Middle Ages..."" which directly translates to ""Before the High Middle Ages was the Early Middle Ages.""  The Templars existed *during* the High Middle Ages, so the period *before* that is the Early Middle Ages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Te rau tau 12** (The 12th century) - This is *within* the High Middle Ages, not before it.
* **C: Te Moata Waenga Ake** (The High Middle Ages) - This is the period *of* the Templars, not before it.
* **D: Te rau tau 13** (The 13th century) -  Also *within* the High Middle Ages.



"
Ko tēhea wā i puta mai i muri i te pakeketanga o nga Templars?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngā Pakeke o Waenganui Tiketike (The Late Middle Ages)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I mua i te High Middle Ages ko te Early Middle Ages, ā, ka whāia e te Late Middle Ages, e kīia ana i mutu tata ki te tau 1500.""  This translates to: ""Before the High Middle Ages was the Early Middle Ages, and it was followed by the Late Middle Ages, said to end around the year 1500.""

Since the Templars arose *during* the High Middle Ages (11th-13th centuries), the Late Middle Ages came *after* their period.



"
He aha te rongoā kāore i whakahuatia e whakamahia ana e nga tākuta me nga tākuta i te Emepaea o Roma?,"The correct answer is **C: Te whakaiti i te rerenga toto mā ngā kōpaki hau**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...me te tourniquet me ngā clamp arterial hei whakatū i te rere o te toto."" This translates to ""...and the tourniquet and arterial clamps to stop the bleeding.""  Therefore, the use of tourniquets and clamps to control bleeding *is* described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ko te maimoatanga o te mate āwangawanga whai-whakamarama mā ngā rongoā āwangawanga rerekē** - The passage doesn't mention treating mental illness.
*   **B: Mā te whakamahi i ngā unu kākano o te taone mo te scopolamine** - The passage mentions scopolamine being derived from the henbane seed.
*   **D: Te whakamahi i ngā tohenga mō ngā tūroro rōpū** - The passage states they knew how to keep soldiers alive from gangrene.

Therefore, option C is the only one *not* described in the passage.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i takea mai i nga kōkiri i mahia i te papa rongoā i te wā o te Emepera o Roma?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **C: Te whakatūnga o ngā hōhipera ako**. 

I kōrero te wāhanga mō te whanaketanga o te rongoā i roto i te emepara Rōma, me pēhea i tīmatahia te taritari i ngā tākuta e Emperor Augustus, ā, ka tū rātou hei Roman Medical Corps.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te whakatūnga o te Rōpū Hauora** – I kōrero te wāhanga mō te tūnga o ngā tākuta hei Roman Medical Corps.
*   **B: Ko te kaupapa here hōia kaha a te Emepera** – I kōrero te wāhanga mō te whakamahi i ngā tākuta ki te rerenga mai o ngā pakanga.
*   **D: Ko te tono a te Emepera i ngā tākuta** – I kōrero te wāhanga mō te tīmatahia te taritari i ngā tākuta e Emperor Augustus.



"
E whakawhirinaki ana te kaha ki te kite ki te aha?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā okana pūoko pūnaha arokite** (Visual system components/structures).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ko te kitenga, ko te pūkenga kia kite rānei e whirinaki ana ki ngā whēkau rongo pūnaha kitenga, ki ngā karu rānei rānei.""  This translates to ""Vision, or the ability to see, relies on the sensory organs of the visual system, or the eyes.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngā whakaritenga o te rauropi** (Requirements of the lens) - While the lens is *part* of the visual system, the passage doesn't say vision relies on the *requirements* of the lens.
* **C: He tairongotanga ki ētahi o ngā roanga ngaru** (Compatibility with some wavelengths) - The passage mentions different wavelengths affect different structures, but doesn't say vision *relies* on this compatibility.
* **D: Ngā waeine o te acuity** (Factors of acuity) - Acuity is *a result* of good vision, not what vision relies on.



"
He aha te rerekētanga o te hanganga o te kanohi i waenganui i ngā rauropi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngā Whakaritenga o te Rauropi (Species Variations)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""He rerekē ngā āheinga o ngā hanganga rerekē"" which translates to ""Different structures have different capabilities."" and ""He rerekē te tika a tētahi ki tētahi, me te mea hoki me rerekē ngā mahinga kia mārama ai ki te āhua o te tāuru me ngā nama rerekē kia pai rawa te mahinga"" which means ""One is more accurate than another, and different methods are needed to understand the nature of the input and different signals to work best.""  This directly points to variations *between species* in their visual systems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Te aro nui ki te roangaru (Focus on wavelength):** While wavelength is mentioned, the passage doesn't say this *is* the difference between species, only that different structures respond to different wavelengths.
* **C: Te taumata o te mata (Eye level):** This isn't discussed in the passage.
* **D: Te matatini o te rauropi (Complexity of the species):**  Complexity isn't the primary focus; the passage is about *structural* differences.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tehea korero mo te Sikhism kare i te whakaatu tika i te karakia?","The correct answer is **A: Ko te Sikhism te hua o te wehewehe ā iwi i roto i te tikanga Hindu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""I ahu mai i te takiwā Punjab i te rautau 15 mai i tētahi whakawehenga hāhi ki roto i te hāhi Hinitū."" This translates to: ""It originated in the Punjab region in the 15th century from a schism (division) within the Hindu faith."" While it *originated* from a division *within* Hinduism, it wasn't a division *of people* (ā iwi). It was a religious split.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **B: Ko te kaiako he āhuatanga taketake motuhake ki te Sikhism** - The text explicitly states ""Ko te guru te tūāpapa o ngā Hāhi Inia katoa, engari ki tā te Hāhi Sikh he whāinga nui kei reira i hua mai ai ngā mātāpono o te Sikh"" - meaning the guru (teacher) is central to Sikhism's principles.
* **C: E iwa ngā kaiako i whai i te kaiwhakarewa o te whakapono, a Guru Nanak** - The passage states ""E iwa ngā wānanga i whai i ana tapuwae"" which means nine successors followed in Guru Nanak's footsteps.
* **D: Kua ū ētahi tikanga o te Tīmatatanga ki te Hindu** - The text says ""ahakoa kei te mihi rātou ki ōna pakiaka, me ōna tikanga Hinitū"" meaning they respect Hindu scriptures and traditions.



Therefore, option A is the only one that misrepresents information from the text."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e whakaarotia ana he aronga uho o te pūnaha whakapono o Tīmata?","The correct answer is **A: Ko te ariā o te kaiako (The role of the teacher/guru)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te guru te tūāpapa o ngā Hāhi Inia katoa, engari ki tā te Hāhi Sikh he whāinga nui kei reira i hua mai ai ngā mātāpono o te Sikh."" (The guru is the foundation of all Indian religions, but for the Sikh faith there is a significant purpose in it from which the principles of Sikhism arose). This directly highlights the central importance of the guru in Sikh belief.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngā tikanga Hindu (Hindu practices):** While the passage mentions Sikhs respect Hindu ancestors and traditions, it doesn’t say this *defines* their belief system.
* **C: He whakakore ki te whakaae ki ētahi atu hāhi Īnia (Rejection of acceptance of other Indian religions):** The passage states Sikhs acknowledge their connection to Hinduism, not reject it.
* **D: E kōrero ana i te reo Punjabi (Speaking the Punjabi language):** While the word ""Gurmat"" is explained as being from Punjabi, speaking the language isn’t a core tenet of the faith itself.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea e uaua ai te arotahi o ngā tamariki e mate ana i te mate āta whakaaro?","The correct answer is **A: Mahi kura** (Schoolwork).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mō ngā tamariki whai ADD he uaua ki a rātou te aro ki ngā mahi kura..."" which translates to ""For children with ADD, it is difficult for them to focus on schoolwork...""

While the passage *also* mentions they *can* focus on enjoyable things like games and TV, it specifically identifies schoolwork as the area of difficulty. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Purei kēmu ana** (Playing games) - The passage says they *can* focus on these.
*   **C: E mātakitaki ana i ngā kāri** (Watching cards) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Ngā mea e hiahiatia ana e rātau ki te mahi** (Things they need to do) - This is too broad. The passage specifically points to *schoolwork* as the struggle.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha ngā tamariki whai Pānga Whakamate, ka uru ki ngā whanonga mōrearea?","The correct answer is **D: Hei whakaoho i o rātau roro** (To stimulate their brains).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...e uru ana rātou ki ngā whanonga mōrearea, te whawhai me te wero i te mana"""" kia whakahihiko i ō rātou roro, i te mea e kore ō rātou roro e hihiko i ngā mea o ia rā.""  This translates to ""...they engage in risky behaviors, fighting and challenging authority"" to stimulate their brains, because their brains aren't stimulated by everyday things.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hei whakaiti i te ngohe pūwerewere** (To reduce boredom) - While boredom *might* be a factor, the passage specifically links the behavior to brain stimulation, not just reducing boredom.
*   **B: Hei āwhina i a rātou ki te tūhono ki ngā hoa** (To help them connect with peers) - The passage doesn't mention social connection as a reason for the behavior.
*   **C: Kia aro atu ai i o rātau mātua** (To get attention from their parents) - Again, the passage focuses on internal brain stimulation, not seeking parental attention.



"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i roto i te whārangi, ko tēhea o ēnei ehara i te tauira o te papa?","The correct answer is **B: He kaiako SAT**.

Here's why:

The passage describes scaffolding as *support* for learners tackling new challenges - like using new software or starting a new project. It gives examples like built-in help within software (virtual scaffolds), or a person offering assistance (like someone helping with Microsoft Office).  

Let's break down why the other options *are* examples of scaffolding:

* **A: He akoranga i te tīmatanga o tētahi kēmu rorohiko (A tutorial at the beginning of a computer game):** This *is* scaffolding. Tutorials provide step-by-step guidance to help you learn the game.
* **C: He hōtaka ako motuhake (A personalized learning program):** Personalized programs adapt to the learner's needs, providing extra support where required – a form of scaffolding.
* **D: He kaiako rōpū iti (A small group tutor):** A tutor provides individual or small group support, helping students overcome difficulties – scaffolding.

**A SAT tutor (He kaiako SAT)** doesn’t fit this model. While helpful, an SAT tutor prepares students for a specific *test*. It's not about supporting the *process of learning something new* in the same way the passage describes scaffolding.  It's focused on mastery of existing content for a standardized assessment.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kōrero e kore e tino whakaahua i te ariā o te papa?,"The correct answer is **B: He nui ake te āwhina i te aratuka akoranga.**

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on scaffolding as *support* for learning, not as a replacement or significant addition *to* the curriculum itself.** Scaffolding helps students access and navigate the curriculum, but it doesn't *become* the curriculum or drastically expand it.  It's about *how* learning happens, not *what* is learned.

Let's look at why the other options *do* reflect the passage:

* **A: Ka taea te noho tūturu ki ngā papa (Can be embedded in classrooms):** The passage implies scaffolding is integrated into existing learning environments.
* **C: E mōhiotia ana hoki hei akoranga kaupapa i runga anō i te (Can also be known as project-based learning):** The passage links scaffolding to new experiences like starting projects.
* **D: Ka whakamahia ngā papa hei tautoko i te tīmatanga o tētahi wheako ako (Scaffolding is used to support the beginning of a learning experience):** This is a core idea of the passage – scaffolding provides support when tackling something new.



Therefore, option B is the statement least supported by the text."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ka whai painga pea te āhuahira MySpace ki ngā ākonga e raruraru ana ki te pānui?","The correct answer is **A: Ritenga**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He māmā te tomo mai ki tēnei whārangi mā te whakarato noa i tētahi whārangi paetukutuku e māma ai te maumahara me te patopato mā ngā ākonga he raru ōna ki te whakamahi i te papatuhi rorohiko, ki te tuhituhi hoki rānei."" 

This translates to: ""It is easy to access this page by simply providing a website page that is easy to remember and beneficial for students who have trouble using computers or writing.""

The phrase ""patopato mā ngā ākonga he raru ōna ki te whakamahi i te papatuhi rorohiko, ki te tuhituhi hoki rānei"" directly implies that MySpace can be *beneficial* (ritenga - meaning benefit, advantage) to students struggling with reading/writing/technology.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Rangitaki** -  While the passage mentions including images, it doesn't say that images *are* the benefit to struggling readers.
*   **C: Tētahi wāhitau tukutuku** - This means ""a website"", which is just a description of what MySpace is, not a benefit.
*   **D: 54 miriona ngā kōtaha** - This is just a statistic about the number of profiles, and doesn't relate to benefits for students.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei ehara i te wāhanga o te urupare a Krushchev ki nga whakararuraru a te kaimahi?","The correct answer is **C: Whakanuia ngā utu (Increase wages)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Kruschev *responded* to the protests by agreeing to some economic demands (D: Kia mōhio ki ētahi whakaritenga ōhanga) and allowing the appointment of a new prime minister (A: Whakatūria he pirimia hou). It also mentions he used force initially (B: Whakamahia ngā reheke hei whakaora i te raupapa).  However, the protests *started* because of *decreased* wages and food shortages - Kruschev did *not* increase wages as part of his response. In fact, he initially reacted to protests *about* wage decreases.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te take o nga tutu i Poland?,"The correct answer is **A: whakakotahitanga (unification)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the protests began over food rations (iti kai) and wage cuts (tapahi wage).** These are direct causes mentioned.
* **The passage also mentions Wladyslaw Gomulka becoming prime minister as a *result* of the protests,** not a cause of them. Kruschev agreed to his appointment to appease the situation.
* **""Whakakotahitanga"" (unification)** is not mentioned as a contributing factor to the protests in the passage. The protests were about economic grievances and ultimately political freedom, not unification.

Therefore, unification is the only option that isn't a cause of the Polish unrest described in the text.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i pā ki te pānga i waenganui i te USSR me te Amerika?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā whakaaro mo Tiamana** (Views on Germany).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the USSR and the USA were *allies* during WWII specifically *because* of Germany (to defeat Germany).  The conflict *after* WWII arose from ideological differences (political systems, ideology, and culture).  While Germany was the initial catalyst for their alliance, the passage doesn't say differing views *on* Germany caused the Cold War – it was what happened *after* defeating Germany.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned as contributing factors:

*   **A: Ngā rerekētanga ahurea** (Cultural differences) - The passage directly mentions ""te ahurea"" (culture) as a source of tension.
*   **C: Ngā tukanga pūrata** (Political systems) - The passage specifically says “o te tūtukitanga o te pūnaha” (the clash of systems) led to the conflict.
*   **D: Ngā tautohe e pā ana ki ngā pūnaha** (Disagreements about systems/ideologies) - This is essentially the same as ""Ngā tukanga pūrata"" and is a key point in the passage.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei kōrero e kore e tino whakaahua i te take o te tuku i ngā pūkaha ki te tinana?,"The correct answer is **C: Kei te pupuri i te mate kāinga** (Preventing hereditary diseases).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes the nervous system maintaining balance (taurite) by sending electrical signals throughout the body to ensure blood flow and keep the body alert.** It also mentions helping the body cope with sudden shocks (whakatuma torohū).

Let's look at why the other options *do* relate to the passage:

* **A: Rere toto pōturi** (Blood circulation) - The passage directly mentions maintaining blood flow (te rere o te toto).
* **B: Whakahaere ana i te rere toto** (Regulating blood flow) - This is essentially the same as blood circulation and is a key function described in the passage.
* **D: Kei te karo i ngā tuma ā-tinana** (Avoiding physical shocks) - The passage states the nervous system helps the body deal with sudden shocks (whakatuma torohū).

* **C: Kei te pupuri i te mate kāinga** (Preventing hereditary diseases) - This is not mentioned in the passage at all. The passage focuses on immediate responses and maintaining homeostasis, not on preventing diseases inherited through genetics.



Therefore, **C** is the option that does *not* accurately reflect the purpose of sending signals throughout the body as described in the passage."
He aha ka kitea i Te Giza Plateau?,"The correct answer is **D: Te Pyramid Nui** (The Great Pyramid).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ko te Great Pyramid ki Giza te mōrehu kotahi anake e tū tonu ana..."" (The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only wonder still standing...) and then goes on to describe the Great Pyramid and other structures *at* Giza.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā Urupa** (Tombs) - While tombs are *part* of what's at Giza, it's not the defining feature mentioned as still standing.
*   **B: Ngā ahumairangi** (Climates) - This is irrelevant to the passage.
*   **C: Nga mea whakamiharo e whitu katoa** (All Seven Wonders) - The passage explicitly states only *one* of the Seven Wonders remains - the Great Pyramid.



"
He aha te take o te Piramidi Nui?,"The correct answer is **B: Hei whakahonore i a Pharaoh**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I hangaia te koeko mīharo hei whakanui i a Pharaoh Khufu..."" which translates to ""The wonderful pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hei kotahi o ngā mea whakamiharo e whitu o te ao** - While true, this is a *result* of its grandeur, not the *reason* it was built.
*   **C: Hei tohu whenua** - The passage doesn't mention this.
*   **D: Hei rokiroki i ngā urupa o ngā tāngata kua mate** - While it's part of a necropolis (city of the dead) and contains tombs, the primary purpose of the *pyramid itself* was to honor the Pharaoh.



"
Ko wai te kawenga mo to tatou mōhiotanga mo te kaiwhakatuma i whakangaro i te temepara?,"The correct answer is **C: Strabo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I tuhia tēnā ingoa e te kaituhi nō Kariki, a Strabo, i mōhio ai tātou i ēnei rā.""  (This name was written by the author from Caria, Strabo, which is how we know about it today.) 

This directly indicates that our knowledge of Herostratus (the arsonist) comes from the writings of Strabo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nga Epeha (The Ephesians):** While the Ephesians were *affected* by the arson, they didn't *record* the information for us to know about it today. They wanted Herostratus' name forgotten.
*   **B: Arehanera te Nui (Alexander the Great):** Alexander offered to rebuild, but wasn't the source of information about the arsonist.
*   **D: Artemis:** Artemis is the goddess the temple was dedicated to, not a historian.



"
He aha te kōrero tika e pā ana ki te hanga anō i te temepara o Aretemi?,"The correct answer is **B: I hanga anōtia i muri i te rangatiratanga o Alexander te Nui**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nō muri mai, ka mate a Alexandra, nāwai rā, ka tū mai anō te temepara i te tau 323 BCE.""  This translates to ""After Alexander died, then the temple was rebuilt in 323 BCE."" This clearly indicates the rebuilding happened *after* Alexander's reign.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I utua te hanga anō e Alexander te Nui** - The text says Alexander *wanted* to pay for it while it was still burning, but didn't. It doesn't say he funded the rebuilding.
*   **C: I whakahaua a Herostratus ki te tiaki i nga utu o te hanga** - Herostratus *destroyed* the temple, he wasn't involved in rebuilding it.
*   **D: I hangaia anōtia i roto i te 320 BCE** - The text specifies the rebuilding happened in 323 BCE, not 320 BCE.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i te wā tata tonu ka haere te momo i runga i nga waewae e rua?","The correct answer is **B: E rua miriona tau ki mua**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te hīkoi te ikiiki tuatahi i mōhiotia, i tīmata tā te tangata hīkoi matika e rua miriona tau ki muri, i te aranga mai o te Homo Erectus...""  This directly translates to: ""Walking is the first skill known, the upright human began two million years ago, with the rise of Homo Erectus.""

Therefore, the passage identifies upright walking beginning **two million years ago**.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei momo e haere tonu ana i runga i ngā waewae e rua?,"The correct answer is **B: Homo Erectus**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""the first known upright walkers, *Homo Erectus* began walking around two million years ago...""  This directly identifies *Homo Erectus* as upright walkers.
* **Sahelanthropus:** While the passage *suggests* they *may* have walked on two legs seven million years ago, it's presented as a possibility (""pea"") not a certainty.
* **Australopithecus:** The passage says they weren't *always* upright.
* **Ngā whakawhāititanga ā-rua (Bipedal adaptations):** This refers to *features* that allow for two-legged walking, not a creature that *does* walk on two legs.

He aha te mea i ngana ai te ope moana Tiamana ki te whakatutuki i te Pakanga Tuarua o te Ao?,"The correct answer is **B: Te ārai i a Britain i te whiwhi tangata me ngā taonga** (To prevent Britain from receiving people and goods).

Here's why:

The passage states that the German navy attempted to establish a blockade ""to disrupt the ability of the enemy to move its people and resources."" Specifically, they used U-boats to try and sink ships transporting supplies from America to Britain. This directly aims to *prevent* Britain from getting the people and resources it needed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te hopu i ngā taonga e haere mai ana i Britain** (To capture goods coming from Britain) - The text focuses on stopping goods *going to* Britain, not capturing goods *from* Britain.
*   **C: E kawe ana i ngā rauemi puta noa i te Atamira** (To transport resources across the Atlantic) - The German navy was trying to *stop* transport, not facilitate it.
*   **D: Te ārai i a Amerika i te whiwhi tangata me ngā taonga** (To prevent America from receiving people and goods) - While disrupting shipments *from* America was part of the strategy, the ultimate goal was to weaken Britain by cutting off its supply lines.



"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i homai i roto i te wāhanga, ko wai i tino angitu ki te pakanga moana i te wā o te pakanga ki te Raki o Atalani?","The correct answer is **A: Ko ngā Ingarangi me ngā Amerikana (The English and the Americans)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Americans *tried* to disrupt German efforts to sink ships aiding Britain. It also implies that if the American efforts (and by extension, British defense) had failed, Germany might have conquered Britain.  This suggests the combined efforts of the English and Americans were successful in maintaining the ability to move people and resources across the Atlantic, while hindering Germany's ability to do the same.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nga Tiamana (The Germans):** The passage describes Germany *attempting* to disrupt shipping, not succeeding in doing so to a degree that shifted the war.
* **C: Ko ngā Tiamana me ngā Ingarangi (The Germans and the English):**  The passage frames them as opposing forces, not working together to achieve success.
* **D: Te Ingarangi (The English):** While Britain was a key target of the German efforts and thus benefitted from the disruption, the passage specifically mentions the *American* attempts to counteract the German U-boats. Their combined efforts are what are highlighted.



"
He aha te mea i kore i te wā i whakatinanahia ai e ngā Āhiria te whakamahi i te kaieke hoiho?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā Saddles** (Saddles).

The passage states: ""Kāore anō te nohonga hōiho i hangaia, nō reira i pakanga te karawhiri Assyrian mā runga i te tuarā ake o ō rātou hōiho.""  This translates to ""Saddles hadn't been invented yet, so the Assyrian cavalry fought on the backs of their horses.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngā Rīpeka** (Reins) - Reins were definitely used with horses.
* **C: Hariata** (Chariots) - The passage discusses *cavalry* (horseback riders), not chariots.
* **D: Kahupeka** (Armor) - The passage mentions armor, but doesn't say it was missing, only that Assyrian spears could penetrate enemy armor.



"
Me pēhea te whawhai i ngā pakanga e whakamahi ana i te karaka?,"The correct answer is **C: I runga hoiho**.

The passage states: ""Around 1000 B.C., the Assyrians established the first mounted cavalry. Cavalry is a warrior who fights on horseback."" This directly answers the question of how battles were fought using cavalry – on horseback.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, kaore koe e kite i tētahi tangata whenua o Babylonian wawaenga?","The correct answer is **D: Te kawe whakahere ki te wahi tapu o roto.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I te kawe mai ngā tāngata i ngā whakahere ki ngā atua..."" (People brought offerings to the gods...) and ""...ka taea anake e ngā pirihi te kuhu."" (only priests could enter).  This indicates offerings were brought *to* a sacred space *within* the temple – the inner sanctum.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te kawe whakahere ki te marae o te temepara** (Bringing offerings to the temple courtyard) - While offerings were brought *to* the temple, the passage specifically mentions they were for the gods, implying a more inner, sacred space.
*   **B: Te haere ki tētahi huihuinga i tētahi temepara matua** (Attending a festival at a major temple) - The passage mentions festivals, but doesn't state common people attended the most sacred parts.
*   **C: I te hakari i te marae o te temepara** (Feasting in the temple courtyard) - No mention of feasting is made in the passage.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei i whakaritea mo nga tohunga?,"The correct answer is **B: whare tapu o roto (inner sanctuary)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I ia temepara tētahi ātea temepara, ā, he whakamaurutanga ki roto ka taea anake e ngā pirihi te kuhu."" This translates to ""Each temple had a courtyard, and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.""  This directly identifies the inner sanctuary as being specifically for the priests.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Huihuinga (Festivals):** The passage mentions festivals as a way to appease the gods, but they weren't *reserved* for priests.
*   **C: Ngā Whakaaturanga (Offerings):** Offerings were *brought to* the gods, but weren't exclusive to priests.
*   **D: Ziggurats:** Ziggurats were the towers themselves, a part of the temple complex, but the highest point was for the god, not the priests themselves to inhabit.



"
Nō whea i rongonui ai a Kingi Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **C: I muri i te kitenga o tona urupa** (After the discovery of his tomb).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""**...nā tāna hura i tēnei toma i te tau 1922 i rongonui ai ia.**"" (It was his tomb's discovery in 1922 that made him famous.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I muri i te tāhaetanga o tōna urupa** (After the looting of his tomb) - The passage says the tomb *wasn't* looted like others.
*   **B: I te wā o tōna kingitanga** (During his reign) - The passage states he wasn't considered very important *during* his reign.
*   **D: I muri i te kōrerotanga i runga i ngā rārangi kīngi tahito** (After being mentioned on ancient king lists) - The passage states he wasn't included on most ancient king lists.



"
He aha i hanga ai a Kingi Tutankhamun hei kingi rongonui o Ihipa?,"The correct answer is **A: Ko te kitenga o tana urupa e kore nei e whakararuraru** (The discovery of his undisturbed tomb).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""**...nā tāna hura i tēnei toma i te tau 1922 i rongonui ai ia.**"" ( ""...it was the discovery of his tomb in 1922 that made him famous."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ko tōna tūnga i runga i ngā rārangi kīngi tahito** (His position on ancient king lists) - The passage says he *wasn't* prominently featured on ancient king lists.
* **C: Ko te tahae i ngā mano o ngā taonga tuku iho i tōna urupa** (The looting of thousands of artifacts from his tomb) - The passage states his tomb was *unlooted* (""i waiho noatia tēnei toma"").
* **D: tōna hiranga i ngā wā o Ihipa onamata** (His importance in ancient Egyptian times) - The passage states he wasn't considered a significant ruler *during* his time.



"
He aha te mea kihai i taea e te kaituhi Kariki a Homer?,"The correct answer is **B: Tirohia (See)**.

Here's why:

The text states Homer was a ""kairotarota kāpō"" - a blind poet.  ""Kāpō"" means blind. Therefore, he couldn't *see*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Whakarongo (Hear)** - Poets need to be able to hear!
*   **C: Haere (Walk)** - Being blind doesn't necessarily prevent someone from walking.
*   **D: Kōrero (Speak/Tell)** - Homer was a poet, so he *could* speak/tell stories.



"
Ko tehea Kariki rongonui e mōhiotia ana mō tētahi mea atu i te tuhinga?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagoras**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ko ētahi atu kaipāngarau rongonui Kariki ko Pythagoras, e mōhiotia ana mō tōna ariā rongonui e pā ana ki ngā hononga o ngā tahataha o ngā tapatoru hāngai.""  This directly says Pythagoras is famous for *mathematics* (the relationship of sides of right triangles - the Pythagorean theorem), not just writing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sophocles** and **D: Aristophanes** are described as writers (""kaitito"").
* **B: Homer** is also described as a writer (""kairotarota"").



"
I hea te nuinga o te wā i noho ai te whānau Hiperu?,"The correct answer is **A: I te hau tuwhera** (In the open air).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko tā te oranga o te whānau Hīperu i waho kē."" This translates to ""The life of the Hebrew family was mostly outside.""  It then describes activities happening *outside* – cooking in a courtyard, open-sided shelters. The passage explicitly states the house wasn't important.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I te tiriti** (In the treaty) - The passage mentions a 'tiritiri' as a type of open shelter, not a place they generally lived.
* **C: I te whārangi** (In the page) - This doesn't relate to where people lived.
* **D: I roto i te whare** (In the house) - The passage specifically says the house was *not* important to their way of life.



"
He aha te mea kihai i tino nui ki te whānau Hiperu?,"The correct answer is **C: to rātau kāinga** (their home).

Here's why:

The passage states ""kāore i tino hirahira te whare"" - ""the house was not particularly important"". It then goes on to describe how life centered *outside* the home, with cooking happening in the courtyard and men openly engaging in contracts. This directly implies that their home wasn't a central focus of their lives.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: to rātau āhuarangi** (their climate) - While the climate is mentioned, the passage doesn't say it wasn't important *to them*. It simply states it influenced how they lived.
*   **B: o rātau pātaka** (their storage) - Storage isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: ta rātau tunu kai** (their cooking) - Cooking *is* mentioned, but it's done *outside* the home, further emphasizing the lack of importance of the house itself.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i te whakaahuatia hei rerekētanga i waenganui i ngā whenua o Scandinavia?,"The correct answer is **B: Te whenua** (The land).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states differences between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland in terms of:

* **Te hītori** (History)
* **Nga tikanga** (Customs)
* **Te iwi** (People/Nations) - implied through mentioning different kings and people.

The passage *doesn't* mention any differences in the *land itself* between these Scandinavian countries. It focuses on cultural, historical, and societal differences.



"
Ko wai i noho tuatahi ki Greenland?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā iwi Eskimo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ahakoa tāna huranga, i reira kē ngā iwi Eskimo e noho ana i taua wā."" This translates to ""Despite his efforts, the Eskimo people were already living there at that time.""  This clearly indicates the Eskimo people were present in Greenland *before* Erik the Red arrived.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Norewai:** While Erik the Red was Norse (Scandinavian), the passage emphasizes the Eskimo were already there.
* **C: Erik te Whero:** Erik the Red *discovered* Greenland for the Norse, but didn't live there first.
* **D: Ngā Tōna:** This isn't mentioned in the text.



"
Ko tēhea rōpū e pai ake ana ki te kai me te kore he tūru?,"The correct answer is **A: Nga wahine Roma taonga** (Wealthy Roman women).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ko tā te hunga pohara, te wahine anō hoki kai i ā rātou kai i te wā e noho ana ki ngā tūru, ko tā te tāne whai rawa he hākari tahi i a rātou e takoto ana ki ō rātou taha i a rātou e kai ana i ā rātou kai."" 

This translates to: ""...the poor, and also women, ate their food while sitting on couches, while wealthy men had a feast while reclining beside them while they ate their food.""

This clearly indicates that wealthy women ate *on* couches, not *without* them, unlike the poor. Therefore, wealthy Roman women are the group described as preferring to eat without reclining.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei e kore e waiho hei wāhanga o te hakari o Roma o mua?,"The correct answer is **D: He whiri o Tāke tunu** (A portion of cooked turkey).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Kāore te Rōma o mua i kai i te tākei."" (The ancient Romans did not eat turkey). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ko ngā manuhiri rawakore e kai ana i ngā tūru** (Poor guests eating at tables) - The passage states the poor ate their meals *while* at tables.
*   **B: He kai mō ngā ngārara** (Food for snails) - The passage mentions snails (""ngā ngata"") as part of Roman feasts.
*   **C: Ko ngā tangata taonga e takoto ana i te wā o te kai** (Wealthy people reclining while eating) - The passage describes wealthy Romans reclining while eating (""ko tā te tāne whai rawa he hākari tahi i a rātou e takoto ana ki ō rātou taha i a rātou e kai ana i ā rātou kai."")



"
"I runga anō i te whakawhitinga, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore e taea te pānga mau tonu?","The correct answer is **B: He ahurea iti**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka maninohea noa ngā ahurea iti nei, ka ngaro ngā kōrero tuku iho e mana ai te iwi hei iwi mananui."" This translates to ""Smaller cultures become clearer, and the traditions that empower the people as a large people are lost.""  This directly indicates that smaller cultures are *vulnerable to being lost* as civilizations develop and larger cultural norms take hold.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: He iwi (A people/tribe):** The passage implies people *become* a larger, more unified group *through* civilization. While the *nature* of the iwi might change, the iwi itself doesn’t necessarily disappear.
*   **C: He kāwanatanga taone (City-state government):** The passage explicitly mentions city-states being a foundational element in the development of civilizations (""Ka tū ngā rohe-tāone nui, kātahi ka puta mai ngā whenua""). They are a *building block*, not something that is lost.
*   **D: He ahurea ā-iwi (Tribal culture):** This is related to 'He iwi,' and while it will be transformed, it isn’t stated as being inevitably *lost* in the same way as smaller, distinct cultures.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha i mua i te iwi?","The correct answer is **C: He kāwanatanga taone**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko tētahi āhuatanga o te ahurea whatutoto ko te tuku i te mātauranga whakawhiti atu i ētahi reanga, tētahi whakarerenga ā-ahurea e toe ana, ā, he tika te tukutuku atu. Ka maninohea noa ngā ahurea iti nei, ka ngaro ngā kōrero tuku iho e mana ai te iwi hei iwi mananui.""  and ""Ko tētahi āhuatanga o te ahurea whatutoto ko te tuku i te mātauranga whakawhiti atu i ētahi reanga, tētahi whakarerenga ā-ahurea e toe ana, ā, he tika te tukutuku atu. Ka maninohea noa ngā ahurea iti nei, ka ngaro ngā kōrero tuku iho e mana ai te iwi hei iwi mananui."" 

This translates to: ""One feature of a complex culture is the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural legacy, and correct documentation. Small cultures become clear, and stories that empower the tribe as a large tribe are lost.""

The passage explains that before a civilization (iwi) forms, there are smaller cultures which eventually give way to larger urban centers (kāwanatanga taone) and then nations.  The passage directly links the development of cities and urban areas to the formation of larger groups and, ultimately, civilizations.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He ahurea ā-iwi** - While related, the passage implies this *develops into* a civilization, it isn't what *precedes* it.
*   **B: He ahurea takitahi** - The passage is talking about the *aggregation* of cultures, not individual ones.
*   **D: He nga ahurea iti** - These exist *before* a civilization, but the text points to them consolidating into larger urban centers as a step *towards* civilization.



"
Ko tēhea kōrero mo te Drukgyal Dzong ehara i te pono?,"The correct answer is **A: I hangaia hei whakanui i te wikitoria o ngā ope o Tibetan-Mongol**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Dzong was built to *commemorate* Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel's victory *against* the Tibetan-Mongol armies.  Option A says it was built to celebrate the victory *of* those armies, which is the opposite of what the text says.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **B: Kei Bhutan:** The passage explicitly states it's in the Paro District of Bhutan.
*   **C: Na te ahi i huna te nui o nga taonga o te pā:** The passage mentions treasures were lost *during* a fire at Drukgyal Dzong.
*   **D: I waihangatia e Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel:** The passage states Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the fortress in 1649.



"
Ko tēhea kōrero e tino whakaahua ana i te putanga o te ahi i te Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **A: Ko te mea anake i toe ko te whakapakoko o Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal** (The only thing left was the portrait of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""I te tau 1951, i mahue noa mai ētahi tāonga i te weranga nui ki Drukgyal Dzong, pērā ki te whakaahua mō Zhabdrung."" (In 1951, some treasures were lost in a major fire at Drukgyal Dzong, such as the portrait of Zhabdrung.)  This directly links the fire to the loss of the portrait.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I wikitoria nga ope o Tibetan-Mongol** (The Tibetan-Mongol forces won) - The passage says the fortress was *built* to commemorate a victory *against* them, not a victory *by* them.
* **C: Kāore i pāngia te manakohanga o te tāwhara** (The structure of the fortress was not affected) - The passage states a fire occurred, implying damage.
* **D: I tiakina e Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel** (Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel protected it) - He *built* it, but the passage doesn't say he protected it *from the fire*.  It says it was later conserved *after* the fire.



"
Ko tehea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki Cambodia?,"The correct answer is **C: I whakaekehia a Cambodia e nga Vietnamese i te timatanga o te rau tau 18**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""I ngā tau whakamutunga o te rautau 18 i eke hoki te hunga Witināma i Kamapōtia."" (In the latter years of the 18th century, the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I whakangaromia e te Vietnam a Phnom Phen** - The passage doesn't say Vietnam sacked Phnom Phen.
*   **B: I whakaekea e Cambodia a Thailand i te tau 1772** - The passage states Thailand *sacked* Phnom Phen, not the other way around.
*   **D: I whakangaromia e nga Tai a Phnom Phen** - While true (the passage says the Thais sacked Phnom Phen in 1772), option C is a more general statement about Vietnamese involvement throughout the later 18th century as mentioned in the passage.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e tino whakaahua ana i ngā whakaekenga o Cambodia?,"The correct answer is **B: I whakaekehia e nga Thai me nga Vietnamese a Cambodia i te 1772**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""I eke ngā Thais i Kamapōtia i ētahi wā i te rautau 18, ā, i te tau 1772 i whakahotu rātou i Phnom Phen."" (The Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century, and in 1772 they sacked Phnom Penh.) and ""I ngā tau whakamutunga o te rautau 18 i eke hoki te hunga Witināma i Kamapōtia."" (In the late 18th century, the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage says the Vietnamese invaded, it doesn’t say it happened *many* times.
* **C:** The passage states the Thais sacked Phnom Penh, not the Vietnamese.
* **D:**  While the passage says the Thais invaded, it also clearly states the Vietnamese did too, making option B more comprehensive.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i mahia e te Kamupene o Īnia ki te Rāwhiti o Hōnea i roto i to rātau wā i Taiwana?,"The correct answer is **D: E pai ana ki te tuku i te mana o Taiwan ki te rangatiratanga o Qing**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Dutch East India Company established a base in Taiwan and began altering indigenous production methods and using Chinese labor. It *didn't* willingly hand over control to the Qing Dynasty; rather, the Qing Dynasty conquered the territory from the Dutch in 1638.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: He turanga ki te taha tonga-uru o te motu** - The passage explicitly states the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan.
*   **B: Whakamahia te whakaputa witi taketake** - The passage says they altered indigenous production methods, implying they *used* them initially.
*   **C: Whakamahia ngā kaimahi Hainamana ki ōna marawhenua** - The passage states the Dutch East India Company employed Chinese workers on its sugar and deer plantations.



"
He aha te whakataunga o te Tiriti o Shimonoseki?,"The correct answer is **D: Te mana o Tiapanī i Taiwana** (Japan's control of Taiwan).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...i muri i te hinga ki te Pakanga Sino-Japanese Tuatahi (1894-1895), ka hainatia e te kāwanatanga Qing te Tiriti o Shimonoseki, nā korā ia i tuku i te tino rangatiratanga o Taiwana ki Hapani..."" 

This directly translates to: ""...after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, as a result of which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te hinga o Hapani i te Pakanga Tuatahi o Haina-Hapana** (Japan's defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War) - The passage says China *lost* the war, not Japan.
*   **B: Te tūnga o Taiwan hei kawanatanga i raro i te rangatiratanga o Qing** (Taiwan's status as a government under Qing rule) - The treaty *ended* Qing rule over Taiwan.
*   **C: te āhei o Taiwan ki te whakahoki i te mana whakahaere i ōna rohe takutai** (Taiwan's ability to regain control of its coastal regions) - The treaty took control *away* from Taiwan/Qing, it didn't give control back.



"
He pēhea te taumata pH o te ine matū?,"The correct answer is **C: Te nui o ngā ions Hydrogen i roto i te matū (The amount of Hydrogen ions in the solution)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ka tūtohu te taumata o te pH mā te nui o te katote Hauwai (te H o te pH) o roto i te matū kua mātaitia.""  This directly translates to ""The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (the H in pH) within the tested solution.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He pēhea te hāngai, te waikawa rānei o te matū (How acidic or alkaline the solution is):** While pH *indicates* acidity/alkalinity, it *is* defined by the hydrogen ion concentration, not just a general description.
* **B: E hia ngā porotoni kei roto i te matū (How many protons are in the solution):**  Protons are hydrogen ions, but pH specifically measures the *concentration* of those ions, not just the total number.
* **D: E hia ngā irahiko kai roto i te matū (How many electrons are in the solution):** Electrons are involved in the chemical reactions that create ions, but pH doesn't directly measure electron count.



"
He aha i tangohia mai i ngā ions Hydrogen?,"The correct answer is **A: Protons**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ko ngā katote Hauwai i turaki iraoho me ngā irahiko... (The hydrogen ions are released as cations and anions...)"" and further clarifies that cations and anions come from the same hydrogen atom.
* **Ions of Hydrogen *are* protons:** A hydrogen atom without its electron *is* a proton (H⁺).  This is the fundamental basis of pH measurement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pH:** pH is a *measure* of hydrogen ion concentration, not what's taken *from* them.
* **C: Alkaline:** Alkaline refers to a pH greater than 7, a property *related to* hydrogen ion concentration, not what they are.
* **D: Ngā Irahiko (Anions):** While hydrogen can *form* anions (like hydride, H⁻), the passage is specifically talking about the released ions in the context of pH, which are H⁺ (protons).



"
Ko tehea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e kore e tika te whakaahua i te hui o nga raiona?,"The correct answer is **A: He ōrite te whanonga o rātau ki ngā rōpū kuri**.

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

* **The text states:** ""Ka āhua pērā te mahi a ngā rōpū raiona i ngā rōpū wuruhi, kurī rānei... he kararehe he ohorere tana ōrite ki ngā raiona (engari kaua ki ērā atu ngeru nui) mō te whanonga.""  This translates to: ""Lion groups act like dog/wolf packs... an animal surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large predators) in style.""  This implies a *similarity* to dogs, but not an *equality* of style. It specifically points out the similarity is surprising *compared to other big predators*.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **B: Kāore te ōwehenga tane ki te wahine i te ōrite** (The male to female ratio is not equal) -  The text mentions several males (1-3) with many females (up to 30) and cubs, indicating an unequal ratio.
* **C: He whanaunga tata ngā tāne me ngā wāhine** (The males and females are closely related) - The text explicitly states the adult males are relatives.
* **D: He whakamate, he pāpori hoki** (They are deadly and aggressive) - The text says they are ""tino whakamate ki ngā kararehe ka patua e rātou"" - ""very deadly to the animals they kill"".



Therefore, option A is the only statement that doesn't accurately reflect the description of lion groups in the text."
Ko tehea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e kore e tika te whakaahua i te whanonga o nga raiona?,"The correct answer is **D: He ōrite tō rātou whanonga ki ētahi atu ngeru nui**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: *""…kaua ki ērā atu ngeru nui""* which translates to ""...not other large predators"". This directly contradicts option D, which claims their style *is* similar to other large predators.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: He tino pāpori rātau** - The passage describes them living in groups called prides, and a family-like structure which implies social and therefore potentially cooperative (and thus, organised/disciplined) behaviour.
*   **B: He ōrite to rātau whanonga ki to nga wuruhi** - The passage explicitly says their behaviour is *like* that of dogs or wolves.
*   **C: He tino whakamate ngā tāne me ngā wāhine ki te kai** - The passage states they are ""very deadly to the animals they kill"". This applies to both males and females participating in hunting.



"
He kai noa iho ngā rākau mō te aha te momo kaiwhaiwhai?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngā poti rahi-waenga** (medium-sized predators).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kei raro i ērā ko ētahi ngeru he rahi waenga ka kai i ngā kararehe he rahi te waenga atu..."" - ""Under them are some predators of medium size that eat animals of medium size...""
* This directly links medium-sized predators to consuming medium-sized animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ngā poti iti (small predators):** The passage focuses on *medium*-sized predators.
* **B: Ngā poti nunui (large predators):** While the passage mentions predators in general, it specifically highlights the medium-sized ones.
* **D: Antelopes:** Antelopes are *prey*, not predators. The passage discusses *who* eats the antelopes, not the antelopes themselves being the predators.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e tino whaia ana e ngā ngeru iti?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā Rodents**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""he tini ngā momo ngeru iti (me ngā ngeru mōkai āwhiowhio hoki) ka kai i ngā tini mea iti nei pēnei i ngā **ngārara**, i ngā paihamu, i ngā mokomoko me ngā manu."" 

""Ngārara"" translates to rodents.  The passage specifically lists rodents as prey for smaller predators.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Rapiti:** The passage mentions raptors (birds of prey) *being* preyed upon, not *being* hunted by the smaller predators.
*   **C: Antelopes:** The passage states larger predators eat antelopes, not the smaller ones.
*   **D: Tia:** Similar to raptors, the passage says smaller predators eat birds (""manu""), but doesn't specifically highlight ""tia"" (birds) as a primary target.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te wāhanga o te tikanga hopu a te ocelot?,"The correct answer is **A: E whakamāramatia ana i roto i to rātau taiao (Explained in their environment)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Ocelots hunt by *smelling* (hongi) to find prey, following where their prey goes. It also mentions their excellent night vision and agility.
* **Options B, C, and D are all mentioned in the passage:**
    * **B: E whai ana i te kakara o a rātau manu (Following the scent of their prey)** - Directly stated: ""e whai ai ia ki hea rā i te whenua ōna kai e haere ana.""
    * **C: I muri i a rātau taonga parakete i te pō (Following their prey’s night movement)** - Implied by their excellent night vision (""he rawe ō rātou karu ki te titiro i roto i te pō uriuri"") and hunting style.
    * **D: E pā ana anake ki ngā kararehe o te rahi iti iho (Only preying on animals smaller than themselves)** - Directly stated: ""Ko te nuinga o ngā kararehe e aru nei ngā ocelot he iti rawa iho i a ia.""
* **Option A is NOT mentioned:** The passage does *not* say the ocelot's hunting method is *explained by* their environment. It describes *how* they hunt, not *why* their environment supports that method.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei kōrero e kore e tika te whakaahua i te ocelot? ,"The correct answer is **C: He ngoikore to rātau mana kakara** (Their sense of smell is weak).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""E whakaaro ana ngā kaimātai pūtaiao mā te hongi e rapu ai te ocelot i āna kai..."" (Scientists believe ocelots use their sense of smell to find food...). This means their sense of smell is *important*, not weak.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Ka taea e rātau te whai pai i te pō** (They can track well at night) - The passage says ""He rawe ō rātou karu ki te titiro i roto i te pō uriuri me ngā tirohanga o te pō..."" (Their eyes are excellent at seeing in the dark and have night vision...).
* **B: Ka neke mārire rātau** (They move gracefully) - The passage mentions ""āta nekeneke hoki"" (agile).
* **D: He pai ake ki a rātau te kimi kararehe iti** (They are better at finding small animals) - The passage states ""Pai ki ngā ocelots te kai i ngā kararehe iti."" (Ocelots like to eat small animals.) and ""Ko te nuinga o ngā kararehe e aru nei ngā ocelot he iti rawa iho i a ia."" (Most of the animals ocelots hunt are smaller than them.).



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e kore e kiia ko te kaha nui o te taikaha?,"The correct answer is **A: Haruru**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states ""Ko te haruru a te taika ehara i te mea he haruru nui..."" (The tiger's roar is not a loud roar...). This means the roar is *not* a significant strength of the tiger.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Piki** - The passage states the tiger can climb (albeit awkwardly).
*   **C: Kei te tīpoka** - The passage says it can leap long distances.
*   **D: Te kumea** - The passage states it can grip/wrestle five times stronger than a strong human.

Therefore, the only option that isn't described as a strength is the tiger's roar (haruru).



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o nga rerekētanga i waenganui i nga tākaro me nga raiona?","The correct answer is **B: Te tangi o to rātau haruru**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te haruru a te taika ehara i te mea he haruru nui pērā ki te raiona, engari he momo ngengere, he momo tīwahawaha."" (The tiger's roar is not as loud as the lion's, but a kind of rumble, a kind of gurgle.) This directly contrasts the sound of a tiger's roar with that of a lion's.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: to rātau kaha kaukau** - The passage says tigers can leap, pounce, jump and climb *much* stronger than a strong human, and are in the same group as lions, leopards and jaguars. It doesn't say their pouncing *strength* differs from lions.
*   **C: to rātau tawhiti peke** - The passage states tigers can jump long distances, but doesn’t compare this ability to lions.
*   **D: Te tōpana o to rātau kume** - The passage refers to the tiger's claws but doesn't mention a difference in claw sharpness compared to lions.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mahi a Robert Hooke i mua i ētahi atu kaimātai koiora?","The correct answer is **A: Tirohia ngā pūtau mate** (Observed dead cells).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ko ia te tangata tuatahi ki te kite i ngā pūtau mate"" (He was the first person to see dead cells).  This directly answers the question of what Robert Hooke did *before* other biologists.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Whakamahia he maramarama hei tiro i tētahi rauropi** (Used a microscope to look at a plant) - While true, the passage doesn't state he was the *first* to do this.
* **C: Mātakina ngā tapawhā iti** (Observed small boxes) - He observed them, but the key point is *what* he observed – dead cells.
* **D: Kimihia ngā waeine mahi iti rawa o tētahi rauropi** (Find the smallest working parts of a plant) - This is a more general description of biological study, not specifically what Hooke did first.



"
"""He aha te take o te kupu """"pūtau"""" te tikanga?""","The correct answer is **B: Rūma iti**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kua ahu mai te kupu pūtau i te kupu cella nō te reo Rātini ko tōna tikanga ko te rūma paku.""  This directly translates to ""The word 'cell' comes from the Latin word 'cella' which means 'small room'.""

Therefore, the reason the word ""pūtau"" (cell) has that meaning is because it originally meant a small room.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko te nuinga o nga kararehe e āhei ana ki te mahi i te aha?","The correct answer is **B: Nuku**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka taea e te nuinga o ngā kararehe te nuku."" which translates to ""Most animals can move/walk."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rere (fly)** - The passage says some animals *can* fly, but not that *most* can.
*   **C: kaukau (swim)** - The passage says some animals swim, but not that *most* do.
*   **D: Keri (dig)** - The passage says some animals dig, but not that *most* do.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha ētahi kararehe kāore i a ia?","The correct answer is **C: Roro**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kei ngā kararehe anake he roro (ahakoa kāore i te katoa o ngā kararehe; hei tauira, kāore he roro tō ngā pūkarukaru)."" This translates to ""Only animals have a backbone (although not all animals; for example, snails do not have a backbone).""  

Therefore, the passage specifically mentions that *some* animals *do not* have a backbone. The question asks what some animals *don't* have, and a backbone (roro) is the answer provided in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā Pūtau (Shells):** The passage mentions animals are *surrounded* by shells, but doesn't say they *lack* them.
*   **B: Te kaha ki te kūnatu (The ability to move):** The passage states most animals *can* move (""Ka taea e te nuinga o ngā kararehe te nuku"").
*   **D: Te kaha ki te kai (The ability to eat):** The passage states animals *do* eat (""Ka kai rātou i ngā mea"").



"
He aha ngā tipu e āwhina ana i te tukanga whakaahua?,"The correct answer is **A: Tāuri**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kei te hangaia e ngā tipu ā rātou ake kai mai i te rā ki te ahotakakame."" This translates to ""Plants create their own food from the sun to photosynthesis.""  **Photosynthesis** is the process of using sunlight to create food, and **tauri** (chlorophyll) is the pigment in plants that *enables* photosynthesis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kararehe (Animals)** – The passage states animals *need* plants to live, not that they help with photosynthesis.
*   **C: Kai (Food)** – Plants *are* food, but they don't *help* with the process of making food (photosynthesis).
*   **D: Rā (Sun)** – The sun is the *energy source* for photosynthesis, but it isn't a part *of* the plant that facilitates the process.



"
He aha te āhua o te tangata e tipu ana i te tāpu?,"The correct answer is **B: Hāora**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka hangaia e te tipu te hāora ka hāngia e te tangata..."" (Plants create breath that humans inhale...). This directly links humans to needing the breath (hāora) created by plants.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kai (Food)** - While the passage mentions plants *being* food, it doesn't say humans ""grow"" food in the ground.
*   **C: Wai (Water)** - Water is important for plants, but the passage doesn't focus on humans growing water.
*   **D: Waro taikura (Gold)** - This isn't mentioned in the passage at all.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā tauira e whai ake nei e aukati i te tukanga kunenga?","The correct answer is **C: He iwi whānui e whakarite ana i tōna whakatikatika ki tētahi taiao hou.**

Here's why:

The passage describes speciation (the formation of new species) as a result of a small group being isolated and *adapting* to a new environment over a long period. This adaptation leads to differences so significant that the two populations eventually become distinct.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I rahua te tipu o tētahi rōpū iti ki tētahi tauwāhi hōu** - This describes the *initial* isolation, but doesn't focus on the adaptation *process* that leads to speciation. It's just the starting point.
*   **B: He wāhanga o tētahi iwi whānui e neke ana ki tētahi taiao hou** - Similar to A, this is about movement, not the crucial adaptation that drives the process.
*   **D: Kotahi te iwi whānui ka hanga i te rua** - This is irrelevant to the concept of speciation described in the passage.

**Option C** directly highlights the core element of speciation described in the text: a population *adjusting* (whakarite ana i tōna whakatikatika) to a new environment. This adjustment through adaptation is what ultimately leads to the formation of a new species.



"
Ko tehea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e kore e tino whakaahua i te tukanga o te whakatū? ,"The correct answer is **B: He āhuatanga nui tēnei o te tukanga kunenga**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes *speciation* (the formation of new and distinct species), not *adaptation* (kunenga).** While adaptation *happens* during speciation, the passage focuses on the isolation of a population and the subsequent divergence into a new species.  Adaptation is about changing *within* a species to fit an environment, speciation is about becoming a *different* species.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **A: Ka puta ina kore e taea e tētahi iwi hou te urutau (It occurs when a new population cannot adapt):** The passage explicitly states the new population *must* adapt to survive in the new environment.  Failure to adapt is implied as a possible outcome that would prevent successful speciation.
* **C: E pā ana ki te hanganga o tētahi momo hou (It relates to the formation of a new species):** This is the core definition of speciation provided in the passage.
* **D: Kāore e taea te takanga (It is inevitable):** The passage states ""Kāore e taea te aha mō te taha ki te koiora"" (Nothing can be done about it in terms of evolution), implying it's a natural and unavoidable process.



Therefore, option B is the only one that misrepresents the process described in the text."
Ko tēhea wāhanga o te pūnaha whakaheke toto e kawe i te toto ki te ngakau?,"The correct answer is **D: iaia** (veins).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ka hoki mai te toto ki te manawa ki ngā pū e kīia ana he ia-auraki.""  This translates to ""Blood returns to the heart through vessels called veins.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā Toi (Arteries):** The passage states arteries *carry blood away* from the heart (""Ka rere atu te toto i te manawa ki ngā pū e kīia ana he ia-tuku..."").
* **B: Ngā Pūmatua (Capillaries):** The passage mentions ""ngongo rauangi"" (capillaries) as the *smallest* vessels, but doesn't say they carry blood *to* the heart.
* **C: Whēkau (Aorta):** The aorta is a major artery leaving the heart, not bringing blood *to* it.



"
Ko tēhea ngā ngongo iti rawa i roto i te pūnaha whakaheke toto?,"The correct answer is **C: iaia**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ko ngā pū iti rawa e kīia ana he **ngongo rauangi**."" (The smallest vessels are called capillary vessels.)
* **""iaia""** is the translation of ""capillary"" in this context.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā Pūmatua** - Arteries (main blood vessels carrying blood *from* the heart)
* **B: Ngā Toi** - Veins (blood vessels carrying blood *to* the heart)
* **D: Whēkau** -  This doesn't directly relate to blood vessels in the described system.



"
Ko te āheinga o te ngārara ki te takahi i ōna parirau ki muri e whakanui ana i tēhea o ēnei?,"The correct answer is **B: Huna i nga waahi (Hiding in places)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mā korā ka whānui ake ngā wāhi iti hei huna i ngā konihi."" (Because of this, small spaces become wider for hiding from predators). This directly links the ability to fold wings to being able to hide more effectively.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tuku kai (Getting food):** While flying helps with finding food, the passage doesn't specifically mention wing folding *aiding* in food acquisition.
*   **C: Kimi hoa (Finding a mate):**  Similarly, flying helps with finding a mate, but wing folding isn't directly tied to that.
*   **D: Terenga rererangi (Flying ability):** The passage talks about flying as a pre-existing ability, and focuses on how wing folding *enhances* survival *because* of that ability, not creating it.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e kore e whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga hei mea e pā ana ki te kaha rere o te ngārara?,"The correct answer is **B: Roanga o te ora (Lifespan)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the *advantages* of flight for insects:** avoiding predators, finding food, and finding mates. It discusses how wings help with these activities.
* **Let's look at each option:**
    * **A: whakaputa (reproduction/laying eggs)** - The passage mentions finding mates, which is directly related to reproduction, and flight aids in this.
    * **C: huihuinga kai (food gathering)** - The passage explicitly states flight makes finding food easier.
    * **D: Maina kaikā (predators)** -  The passage states flight helps insects *avoid* predators.
    * **B: Roanga o te ora (Lifespan)** - The passage *doesn't* discuss how flight affects how *long* insects live. It only talks about what they *do* with the ability to fly.

Therefore, lifespan is the only option not connected to the benefits of insect flight as described in the passage.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā āhuatanga e whai ake nei kāore i te pāhono nuitia ki ngā dinosaur?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngā waewae i whakaritea** (Organized feet).

Here's why:

The passage states the creature walks on its hind legs *like* a T-Rex. This implies its feet aren't particularly ""organized"" or different - they are similar to a dinosaur's feet.  The passage emphasizes similarities *to* dinosaurs, not distinct differences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E haere ana te waewae o muri** (Hind legs walking) - The passage *specifically* mentions walking on hind legs.
*   **B: Huruhuru** (Feathers) - The passage states it has feathers, a feature some dinosaurs possessed.
*   **C: whakatakoto hēki** (laying eggs) - The passage states it lays eggs, which is a common dinosaur characteristic.



Therefore, ""organized feet"" is the feature least associated with the description of this dinosaur-like creature."
Ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i te whakaarotia noatia hei āhuatanga tiritiri o ngā manu me ngā dinosaur?,"The correct answer is **D: E rongo ana ki ngā hē (Hearing feathers)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the link between birds and dinosaurs.** It highlights similarities like feathers, walking on two legs (like the T-Rex), and laying eggs.
* **Hearing feathers is not a known or considered feature** of either birds *or* dinosaurs.  Feathers are for flight, insulation, and display, but not for hearing.

Let's look at why the other options *are* related to the passage:

* **A: Ngā hēki e pā ana ki ngā hēki (Eggs relating to eggs):**  Both birds and dinosaurs lay eggs, as stated in the passage.
* **B: Mā te whakamahi i ngā waewae whakamuri e rua hei haere (Using two hind legs to walk):** The passage explicitly mentions the T-Rex walking on its hind legs, and birds also walk on two legs.
* **C: Te kaha ki te rere (The ability to fly):** The passage states that the creature (believed to be a dinosaur) ""can fly"" and mentions feathers, which are crucial for flight in birds.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea wāhanga o te tipu cycad tērā pea ka kai tētahi Triceratops?","The correct answer is **A: Ka rau te spiky**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kua taea e te Triceratops te whakamahi i tana ngutu kaha kia mahura i ngā rau i mua i te kāinga o te tīwai."" (The Triceratops could use its strong beak to shear off the leaves before they were housed in the stem.)

While the passage mentions the fruit of the cycad being potentially toxic, it highlights the Triceratops eating the *leaves* specifically. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Te pūtake (The root):** The passage doesn't mention the Triceratops eating the roots.
*   **C: Te pakiaka (The trunk):** The passage doesn't mention the Triceratops eating the trunk.
*   **D: Nga hua rākau (The fruit):** The passage suggests the fruit might have been *too* toxic for Triceratops to eat, though other animals do.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ka tino kai te Triceratops? ","The correct answer is **D: He tipu me ngā hua paitini** (Plants with poisonous fruits).

Here's why:

The passage states that scientists believe Triceratops ate cycads, which are described as having poisonous seeds/fruits. While the passage notes that modern animals *can* eat these poisonous parts, it specifically links the Triceratops to consuming the plants *including* those fruits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He kāniwha** (Serpent/Dragon) - The passage doesn't mention any reptiles eating Triceratops.
*   **B: He tipu me ngā manga pakeke** (Plants with tough beaks) - This isn't directly mentioned as a food source. The passage focuses on the leaves and fruits of cycads.
*   **C: Kākā** (Parrot) - While the passage mentions parrots eating poisonous fruits *today*, it doesn't say Triceratops ate them or that they are a primary food source.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā hākinakina e whai ake nei e tino manakohia ana i ngā rohe ki te raki o Itari?","The correct answer is **A: Whutupōro**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He rorotu rawa ngā hākinakina hōtoke ki ngā takiwā Raki..."" (Many sports are popular in the northern regions...) and then lists several sports including ""te whutupōro"" (skiing).

The other options are not specifically mentioned as being popular in northern Italy in the passage.



"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i homai i roto i te wāhanga, ko tēhea o ngā hākinakina e whai ake nei i toa i tētahi whakataetae ao mō Itari?","The correct answer is **A: Whutupōro**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kei roto i ngā tākaro rorotu ko... te whutupōro..."" (Among the sports are... volleyball...) and also mentions Italy competing in world championships and the Olympics. While not explicitly stated they *won* a world championship, whutupōro is the only sport listed that is mentioned in connection to international competition.

The other options are not mentioned as sports Italy participates in at a world level within the provided text.



"
I muri i te aha i riro ai ētahi wāhanga o Luxembourg hei wāhanga o Peeke?,"The correct answer is **B: Ko te Huringa o Belgian** (The Belgian Revolution).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ko ētahi wāhi o nāianei o Belgium he wāhanga o mua o Luxembourg ēngari i Belgianngia whai muri i ngā tau 1830 o te hurihanga nui a Belgian."" This directly translates to: ""Some areas now of Belgium were formerly part of Luxembourg but became Belgian after the 1830s of the great Belgian revolution.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pakanga Ao I** (World War I) - Luxembourg was *occupied* by Germany during WWI, but didn't *lose* territory to Belgium then.
*   **C: Pakanga Ii o te Ao** (World War II) - Similar to WWI, Luxembourg was occupied, not partitioned to Belgium.
*   **D: Te kitenga o te Uniana o Ūropi** (The founding of the European Union) - This happened *after* the territory was already part of Belgium.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei āhuatanga e pā ana ki te tōrangapū o Luxembourg?,"The correct answer is **B: Hono ana ki te Uniana o Ūropi** (Joining the European Union).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""I te tau 1957 i tū a Luxembourg hei mema whakatū o te whakahaere e mōhiotia ana ināianei hei Te Kotahitanga o Ūropi."" (In 1957, Luxembourg became a founding member of the organization now known as the European Union.) This directly relates to the political landscape of Luxembourg.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Te noho a Tiamana** (German occupation) - While mentioned, this is a period *of* political impact *on* Luxembourg, not a defining characteristic of its political system itself.
* **C: Ko te Huringa o Belgian** (Belgian Revolution) - This is historical context *affecting* Luxembourg's borders, but not a current aspect of its political structure.
* **D: Te noho hei whenua motuhake** (Remaining an independent country) -  The passage states Luxembourg *strove* to remain independent, but it's a goal, not a political feature demonstrated in the text like EU membership is.



"
E hia ngā kiromita tapawha o te rohe katoa o Turkey kei Uropi?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The text states: ""Kei Ūropi te 23,764 kiromita pūrua (9,174 maero pūrua)."" This directly answers the question of how many square kilometers of Turkey are in Europe."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, e hia ngā māwhiti te roa o Tāke?","The correct answer is **D: 1000**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te rohe o Tākei he nui ake i te 1,600 kiromita (1,000 māero) te roa..."" This translates to ""The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) long...""

Therefore, the length of Turkey is approximately 1000 miles.



"
He aha te reo Rātini e whakamahia ana i Vatican City?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā tikanga whakapono** (Religious practices/ceremonies).

Here's why:

The text states: ""kei te tino whakamahia te reo Rātini ki ngā kawa ā-hāhi"" which translates to ""Latin is strongly used in religious rites/practices.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Whakawhitinga ia rā** (Daily communication) - The text says Italian is used for daily communication.
* **C: Ture** (Laws) - The text states Italian is used for laws and documents.
* **D: Whakawhitiwhiti whai mana** (Formal exchanges) - While Latin might be *part* of some formal exchanges, the text specifically links it to religious practices.



"
"I roto i te Vatican City, he aha te kore e whakamahia ai te reo Itari?","The correct answer is **C: Ngā tikanga whakapono** (Religious practices).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""kei te tino whakamahia te reo Rātini ki ngā kawa ā-hāhi"" (Latin is mainly used in religious rites). This means Latin, *not* Italian, is used for religious practices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ture** (Laws) - The passage explicitly says Italian is used in laws and documents.
*   **B: Whakawhitiwhiti whai mana** (Official communication) - The passage says Italian is used for official communication.
*   **D: Whakawhitinga ia rā** (Daily conversation) - The passage says Italian is the language used in daily interactions by most workers.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā painga e whai ake nei mai i te whāranu oro i runga i ngā rorohiko mātauranga?","The correct answer is **A: Puoro**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He nui ngā wā ka rīkoatatia te puoro mā ngā rorohiko mātanga hei whakarite, hei whenumi tahi hoki i ngā oro.""  This translates to ""Many times sound is recorded using intelligent computers to arrange and also mix sounds.""

This directly refers to the benefit of **sound** manipulation/recording through computer software.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngā Hākoritanga (Recordings):** While recordings *result* from the process, the benefit highlighted is the *manipulation* of the sound itself.
* **C: Ngā Pikitia (Pictures):** The passage mentions images and movies, but doesn't link computer manipulation specifically to *benefits* of sound.
* **D: Hanganga (Construction/Creation):**  This is too broad.  The passage specifically discusses *sound* as the benefit.

The passage specifically states: ""Kei ngā tāone nui o **Harappa, o Mohenjo-daro** hoki tētahi wharepaku wai ki te tata ki ngā whare katoa..."" (Both the major cities of Harappa and **Mohenjo-daro** had a toilet connected to nearly every house...).

The question asks which location had toilets connected to most homes.  Mohenjo-daro is explicitly mentioned as having this feature. While other locations *had* toilets, they weren't necessarily connected to *nearly every house* like in Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.



"
I whea o ngā wāhi e whai ake nei i kitea ai ngā pūnaha waipiro matatau?,"The correct answer is **B: Santorini**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kua kitea ngā toenga o ngā pūnaha paru ki ngā whare o ngā tāone nui Minoan o Crete me **Santorini** ki Kariki."" (The remains of drainage systems have been found in the houses of the large Minoan cities of Crete and **Santorini** in Greece.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Harappa:** While Harappa *had* drainage systems, the question asks where *complex* drainage systems were found. The passage doesn't specifically label Harappa's as complex.
*   **C: Īhipa:** The passage states Egypt *had* latrines, but doesn't mention complex drainage systems.
*   **D: Haina:** Similar to Egypt, the passage mentions latrines in China, but not complex drainage systems.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e ārahi ana i te Skater kia huri?,"The correct answer is **A: Ko te ānau iti i te raro o te papa o te Skate** (The small bump on the bottom of the skateboard).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Nā te mea kei te āhua ānau te taha whakararo o te mata, ka tītaha te mata ki tētahi taha, ki tērā atu taha rānei, ka ānau hoki te taha e pā ana ki te tio.""  This translates to: ""Because the underside of the board is bumpy, the board will tilt to one side or the other, and the side touching the ground will bump. From there, the skateboard will turn.""

The passage directly links the ""ānau"" (bump) on the underside of the board to causing the turning action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ko ngā pito e rua i te taha o te papa o te Skate** (The two edges on the side of the skateboard) - While the edges help with grip, they aren't the *cause* of the turn, but rather assist with stability *during* a turn.
* **C: Ko te taumata āheinga whānui o te Skater** (The general skill level of the Skater) - Skill is important, but the passage describes a *physical mechanism* for turning, not the skater's ability.
* **D: Te kounga o te hukapapa** (The quality of the surface) -  The surface affects how easily the board rolls, but doesn't initiate the turn itself.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e whakamārama ana i te hāngai i runga i te rau o tētahi hukapapa o nāianei?","The correct answer is **B: Ānau**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Nā te mea kei te āhua **ānau** te taha whakararo o te mata..."" (Because the underside of the surface is **curved**...). This curvature is what causes the surface to tilt and the carrier to turn.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mata-taurua (Symmetrical):** The passage describes an *asymmetrical* surface, as it tilts to one side or the other.
* **C: Concave:** While ""concave"" could *describe* a curve, the passage uses the Māori word ""**ānau**"" specifically to describe the shape.  Using ""concave"" would be an interpretation, not a direct match to the text.
* **D: Tilted:**  ""Tilted"" is a *result* of the curved shape, not the shape itself. The passage explains *why* it tilts (because of the curve).



Therefore, **Ānau (curved)** is the most accurate answer because it's the term used in the passage to describe the crucial characteristic of the surface."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, He aha te tukanga e āhei ai ngā ngota ki te whakakore i te pūngao o te marama?","The correct answer is **A: Parawhiti**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a process where atoms return to their original energy level, releasing extra energy gained from light. This release is described as ""stimulated emission of radiation"" where photons are *emitted* (released) by the atoms. This emission *is* reflection – the atoms are responding to light by releasing more light.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Whakaongaonga te tukunga o nga whakaahua (Concentrated emission of images):** The passage doesn't talk about concentrating images, but about releasing photons (light).
* **C: Whakaahua (Imaging):**  Again, the passage is about the *release* of light, not creating an image.
* **D: Ko te hara o te parawhitiwhiti (The error of reflection):**  The passage *describes* reflection, it doesn't suggest it's an error.



**Key phrase from the text that supports the answer:** ""e hikohikongia ana ngā ngota e ngā raiti muramura, e puha ai te pūaho o te raiti"" -  ""atoms are stimulated by incoming light, releasing a stream of light."" This is fundamentally a process of reflection."
He aha te take o te ngota hai whakaputa whakaahua?,"The correct answer is **B: Ko te whakaongaonga i puta mai i te marama kaha** (Stimulation from strong light).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...e hikohikongia ana ngā ngota e ngā raiti muramura, e puha ai te pūaho o te raiti..."" which translates to ""...the atoms are stimulated by energetic rays, causing the emission of a ray bundle...""  This directly links light (raits muramura - energetic rays) to the atom's emission of light (pūaho o te raiti - ray bundle).
* **""Stimulated emission of radiation""** is the scientific term used in the passage, clearly indicating that stimulation *by* light is the key process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Te tuku pūngao nui** (Large energy release) - While energy *is* released, the passage doesn't say this is the *cause* of the emission, but rather the *result* of stimulation.
* **C: Ngā taumata pūngao hauā** (Energy level states) - The passage mentions energy levels implicitly (through the concept of stimulation), but doesn't state they are the primary reason for image production.
* **D: He urupare kino ki te hihi** (Harmful interference to the spectrum) -  This isn't mentioned in the passage at all.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te take o te pūrama mārama kia mutu te mahi?","The correct answer is **C: E tahuna ana te kaka i roto i te pūrama** (The filament inside the bulb is broken).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Whai muri i ngā tini hāora o te mahi, ka pakarū te kaka o te rama, ā, ka kore anō te rama e mahi.""  This translates to: ""After many hours of use, the filament of the bulb breaks, and the bulb no longer works.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kāore i te tika te whakaweto i te maunga mārama** (The lamp mount is not correctly installed) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the lamp mount.
* **B: He pūtake whakarewa anake o te pōtae o te pōtae** (Only a power source problem with the cap) - The passage focuses on the bulb itself, not the power source initially. It does talk about needing to disconnect power for replacement, but the *reason* for failure is the filament.
* **D: Ko te rere o te hiko ki roto i te kōpaki e whakaiti ana** (The flow of electricity into the casing is decreasing) - The passage warns about the dangers of electricity *because* the filament is broken, not that a decrease in electricity is the cause of the break.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e taea te mōrearea ki te pa ki te whakakapi i tētahi pōtae?,"The correct answer is **C: Te pūtake o te pūrama** (The base of the bulb).

Here's why, based on the provided text:

The text explicitly states: ""Me mātu weto i te kōhao rama me wete rānei i te taura hiko."" (You must switch off the light switch and/or disconnect the power cord).  It then warns about the danger of electric shock when replacing a bulb, specifically mentioning touching ""te umanga"" (the socket/fitting) while power is still on.  This directly relates to the *base* of the bulb fitting into the socket.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te Filament** (The Filament) - The filament is *inside* the bulb, you wouldn't directly touch it during replacement.
*   **B: Te whakawhiti rama** (The light switch) - You *turn off* the switch, you don't touch it during bulb replacement.
*   **D: Te taura** (The cord) - You *disconnect* the cord, you don't touch it during bulb replacement (although disconnecting it is a safety measure).



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea ka wehea te karihi?","The correct answer is **D: Kua ngaro ngā Neutrons** (Neutrons have been released).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ka tukuna ai ētahi o taua ngoi."" (""...some of those neutrons are released."")  ""Ngoi"" in this context refers to neutrons.  The description of fission explains that the nucleus is split and neutrons are *released* as a result.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ka whiwhia ngā Protons** (Protons are gained) - The passage doesn't mention gaining protons.
*   **B: Kua tukua te pūngao** (The energy is released) - While energy *is* released, the question asks what is being *split* or *released* from the nucleus itself.
*   **C: Kua tūkinotia ngā Atoms** (Atoms are destroyed) - Atoms aren't destroyed, the *nucleus* of an atom is split.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whakaatu ana i ngā waea tawhiti ki te Ao,"The correct answer is **A: Telescopes**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions ""āmiorangi"" (telescopes) being used to make long-distance calls and observe the universe.** It talks about them being launched into space by rockets and used by scientists.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Ngā Aorangi (Clouds):** Clouds obstruct vision, they don't *receive* signals.
    * **C: Ngā Kōmā (Comets):** Comets are celestial bodies, not communication devices.
    * **D: Pūroro (Computers):** Computers *process* information, but they aren't the instruments used to initially receive signals from a distance.

**Translation help:** The passage describes using telescopes (launched by rockets) for long-distance communication and scientific observation, particularly addressing the impact of solar flares on communication signals.  The question asks what is used to see distant objects in space.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whakamahia ana hei tuku i tētahi pouaka whakaata ki te mokowā?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngā aorangi neke atu i te 100 waewae te teitei** (The atmospheres over 100 feet high).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Mā te rākete rahi nui ake i te 100 putu te teitei e tuku i tētahi āmiorangi, karu whātata ranei ki tuarangi.""  This translates to: ""A large rocket over 100 feet high delivers an atmosphere, or a close-range camera, to space.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā kurupae kōmā (Comets):** Comets are icy bodies, not used to deliver signals or cameras.
* **B: Pūroro (Bubbles):** Bubbles have nothing to do with space communication.
* **C: Hau takiwā o te Ao (World regional air):** This is too general and doesn't relate to the method of delivery described.



"
He aha te mea me mōhio e pā ana ki tētahi kaupapa hurihuri hei whai i te haere o te wā?,"The correct answer is **A: Roanga** (Duration/Length).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mā te wā hoki e whakataurite ai tātou i te roanga o ngā mahinga."" This translates to ""Time also allows us to measure the duration of things.""  It directly links time to understanding how long something takes.
* **The passage also says:** ""Ko tētahi mahi hurihuri ko tētahi mahi he auau te puta mai anō."" which means ""A cyclical activity is one that repeats continuously.""  To understand the *flow* of time through a cyclical activity, you need to know how *long* each cycle takes – its duration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tāruatanga (Frequency):** While frequency is related to cyclical things, the passage focuses on *measuring* time *through* the cycle, not just how often it happens.
* **C: Pānga (Effect/Impact):** The passage doesn't discuss the effects of a cyclical activity, only how it helps us perceive time.
* **D: Te Uaua (Difficulty/Complexity):** The passage acknowledges time can be difficult to understand, but that isn’t what helps us *follow* its progression in a cyclical event.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te āhua o tētahi takahanga e whakamahia ana hei whakataurite?","The correct answer is **A: Roa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mā te wā hoki e whakataurite ai tātou i te **roanga** o ngā mahinga.""  This directly translates to ""Time also allows us to compare the **length** of tasks.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tāruatanga (Frequency):** While the passage mentions repetitive actions (""he auau te puta mai anō""), it doesn't say frequency is *used for comparison*.
* **C: Tautōhito (Identity/Sameness):** This doesn't relate to how time is used for measurement in the passage.
* **D: Pānga (Impact/Effect):**  The passage talks about the *impact* of time, but not using impact *as* a comparison point.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tehea o ēnei e kiia ana he tauira mō tētahi kaiwhiwhi o te torona?","The correct answer is **A: Kei te whiwhi i tētahi waeine 2:2** (Achieving a 2:2 grade).

Here's why:

The passage states that Tiare received a 2:2 in History. The question asks for something that characterizes someone who *received* a qualification. A 2:2 is a qualification (a second-class honours degree, second division).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ka whakarerea te whare wananga ki te uru atu ki te hoia** (Leaving university to join the military) - The passage states the opposite; Tiare went *to* university *before* potentially joining the military (as the first sentence suggests was typical).
* **C: Hītori Ako** (Studying History) - While Tiare *did* study History, the question asks for a characteristic of a recipient of a commission, not just someone who studies a subject.
* **D: Haere ana ki te whare wānanga i mua i te hononga ki te hōia** (Going to university before joining the military) - This is true of Tiare, but it's a general statement, not a specific qualification or characteristic relevant to *receiving* a commission.



"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i hoatu i roto i te wāhanga, ko Charles te tuatahi ki te mahi i te aha?","The correct answer is **D: Haere ki te Kāreti Trinity**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko Charles te mema tuatahi o te Whānau Kīngi o Peretānia kia whakawhiwhia ki tētahi tohu paetahi...ki te Kārihi o Trinity, ki Kemureti."" (Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to be awarded a degree...at Trinity College, Cambridge). This directly states he was the first to attend Trinity College.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Haere ki te ope taua i mua i te whakaotinga o te kura:** The passage mentions blue blood being *drawn* to military school *after* finishing school, but doesn't say Charles did this first.
*   **B: Ako i te Pūranga:** The passage doesn't mention Charles studying accounting.
*   **C: Whiwhi Waeine:** The passage doesn't mention Charles getting married.



"
Nō tēhea whenua te kaipuke a Trygvasson?,"The correct answer is **D: Nōwei**.

The text states: ""Nā Olaf Trygvasson tēnei kāhui i ārahi, he uri nō **Nōwini**..."" which translates to ""This group was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a descendant of **Norway**..."" 

Therefore, Trygvasson is from Norway.



"
He aha te wā i roto i te hītori i whakamahia ai e Tiamana he āhuatanga ahurea kaha ki Estonia?,"The correct answer is **A: Neke atu i te 200 tau ki mua**.

Here's why:

The passage states Estonia was under German rule for 150 years (""Nō te rautau 15 i noho ai a Estonia..."").  150 years is ""neke atu i te 200 tau ki mua"" (more than 200 years ago) is the closest and most accurate option provided.

The other options are too distant in time according to the text."
He aha te take i puta ai te reo Estonian?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngā māngai Tiamana** (German monks).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I hiahia ētahi monaki Tiamani kia tuku i te Atua kia tata ake ki ngā iwi taketake, nō reira i hanga rātou i te reo ā-kiko o Etōnia."" (Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the native peoples, therefore they created the written Estonian language.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te pūāhua Õ/õ** (The letter Õ/õ) - This is a *feature* of the Estonian language, not the *reason* it was created.
*   **B: Te tātai reta Tiamana** (German alphabet) - While based on German, the alphabet itself isn't the reason for its creation.
*   **D: Atua** (God) - While the monks' motivation was religious, God wasn't the *cause* of the language's creation, the monks were.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko te maha o ngā tukuoro Hīni māori e tārere ana i runga anō i tēhea āhuatanga?","The correct answer is **C: Mēnā ka tatau i ngā tāngata e mōhio ana ki te reo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""E rerekē ana te tau o ngā kaikōrero ūkaipō i runga i te tatau, kāore rānei i ngā mita tino tata te hononga.""  This translates to ""The number of spoken language users varies depending on the census, or the connection is not very close with the most precise figures.""  Essentially, the count *depends on how people who understand the language are counted*. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't mention languages similar to Hindi being counted.
* **B:** While the passage mentions Urdu, it says the *number of Hindi speakers* varies with the census, not the number of Urdu speakers.
* **D:** The passage distinguishes between spoken and written Hindi (and its relation to Urdu), and the variation in numbers relates to *understanding* the language, not necessarily being able to *read* it.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kōrero e tika ana mō te reo Hindi me te reo Urdu?,"The correct answer is **B: He rerekē rātou ki te hōtuhi** (They differ in writing).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""He rite te Hindi me te Urdu ki te taha wete reo heoi he rerekē te taha tuhinga"" - This translates to ""Hindi and Urdu are similar in spoken form but differ in writing.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I te nuinga o te wā he wehe i waenganui i ngā kaikōrero o ngā reo e rua** (Speakers of the two languages generally understand each other) - The passage actually says speakers *do* understand each other in spoken form.
* **C: He ōrite rātau i roto i te kupu me te tuhinga** (They are the same in words and writing) -  This is the opposite of what the passage states.
* **D: He rereke nga kupu** (They have different words) - While there are some differences, the passage emphasizes the similarity in *spoken* form. The primary difference is the writing system.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kōrero e kore e tika mō te reta Hangeul?,"The correct answer is **B: Ko te ingoa taketake o te reta ko Hunan Jeongeum**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""I tapa tūturu ia i te arapū Hanguel ki **Hunmin Jeongeum**..."" (He originally promulgated the Hanguel alphabet as **Hunmin Jeongeum**...)
* **The question asks** for the *incorrect* statement.  ""Hunan Jeongeum"" is a misspelling of ""Hunmin Jeongeum"".

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: I hangaia i te tīmatanga o te rangatiratanga o Kingi Sejong** - The passage states it was created in 1444 during King Sejong's reign.
* **C: I hangaia e te kīngi tuawhā o Joseon Hau** - The passage explicitly says King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty.
* **D: I waihangatia i runga i te take** - The passage states the meaning of Hunmin Jeongeum is """"ngā oro tika mō te whakaako i te tangata"""" (""the proper sounds for the instruction of the people""), indicating it was created with a purpose.



"
I te mutunga ka hurihia te reta Hunmin Jeongeum ki te aha?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I tapa tūturu ia i te arapū Hanguel ki Hunmin Jeongeum..."" This means King Sejong originally proclaimed the letters of Hangeul *as* Hunmin Jeongeum.  Therefore, Hunmin Jeongeum is the original name for what we now know as Hangeul.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sejong** - King Sejong was the person who *created* it, not what it became.
*   **C: Joseon** - Joseon was the dynasty during which it was created.
*   **D: Jeongeum** - Jeongeum is part of the original name (Hunmin *Jeongeum*), but not the final, commonly used name.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko ēhea ngā reo i whakaawetia e Sanskrit?","The correct answer is **D: Ngā reo Īnia (Indian languages)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ko ia hoki te reo taketake o ngā tini reo Īniana o nāianei..."" which translates to ""...and it is also the ancestral language of many present-day Indian languages...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā reo Rātini (Latin languages)** - While the passage draws a *parallel* between Sanskrit and Latin as ancestral languages, it doesn't say Sanskrit *influenced* Latin directly.
* **B: Ngā reo Ūropi (European languages)** - Similar to Latin, it's a comparison, not a direct influence stated in the text.
* **C: Reo tahito (Polynesian languages)** - The passage doesn't mention any connection to Polynesian languages.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i whakahekea te whakamahinga o te Sanskrit nā te aha?","The correct answer is **D: Aroākapa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Whai muri mai i te whakahiatotanga o Upanishards, e memeha noa iho a Sanskrit i ngā mahi nahanaha."" 

This translates to: ""After the emergence of the Upanishads, Sanskrit declined in practical use."" 

""Aroākapa"" (decline/reduction) best reflects this meaning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Matatinitanga** (Complexity) - While Sanskrit *is* complex, the passage doesn't say its complexity caused its decline.
*   **B: Hekenga Aryan** (Aryan Migration) - The passage mentions the Aryan migration as part of Sanskrit's origin, not its decline.
*   **C: Ngā reo Rātini** (Latin Languages) - Latin languages are presented as related to Sanskrit, not the cause of its decline.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he tauākī tika e pā ana ki te tō ā-papa i Io?","The correct answer is **A: Ka iti ake te kaha o te whenua ki a koe i te kaha o Io** (The force of gravity on you is less on Io than on Earth).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ki te tū koe i runga i te mata o Io kua iti ake tō taumaha tēnā i tō taumaha ki runga o Papatūānuku."" (When you stand on the surface of Io, your weight is less than your weight on Earth).  Less weight *directly* means less gravitational force.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** This is backwards.  The passage says *you* weigh less, not that heavier things pull you less.
* **C:** The passage says you weigh *less* on Io, not more.
* **D:** This is the opposite of what the passage states. The force of gravity is *weaker* on Io.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā tauākī e whai ake nei e whakamārama tika ana i te apa whakawaho o te Marama?","The correct answer is **A: He matotoru ake te kiri o te taha tata**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He tata ki te 70 km te mātotoru o te kirinuku ki te taha tata, ā, e 100 km te mātotoru ki te taha tawhiti.""  This directly translates to ""The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side, and 100 km thick on the far side.""  Therefore, the crust is *thicker* on the near side.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He māmā ake te kiri i raro i ngā whenua teitei** - The passage mentions the crust *under* the maria (the dark plains) is thicker, not easier to develop.
* **C: Tērā pea he iti ake ngā maria i te taha tua atu** - The passage doesn't directly state whether there are fewer maria on the far side, only that the crust is thicker there.
* **D: Tērā pea he iti iho ngā maria i raro i ngā whenua teitei** - The passage states the opposite - that maria are more likely to develop where the crust is thinner (like on the near side).



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, kei hea te kirinuku o te Marama te mātotoru rawa?","The correct answer is **A: Kei te taha tata** (On the near side).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He tata ki te 70 km te mātotoru o te kirinuku ki te taha tata, ā, e 100 km te mātotoru ki te taha tawhiti.""  (The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the near side, and 100 km on the far side.) This directly indicates the crust is thicker on the far side, therefore thinner (and thus least thick) on the near side.



"
"I runga anō i te whakawhitinga, ko tēhea o ēnei e whakaponotia ana e ētahi tāngata?","The correct answer is **C: Kei ētahi atu aorangi te ora** (There is life on other planets).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ka whai whakaarohia e ētahi tāngata he aha kei waho rā kei te whakapono ētahi he tautangata, he koiora anō kei te noho pea kei tētahi atu aorangi.""  This translates to ""...some people wonder what is out there and believe that aliens, or other life, may live on another planet.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kua haere ngā tāngata ki ētahi atu whetū** (People have traveled to other stars) - The passage says this *could* happen in the future, but hasn't happened yet.
* **B: Kāore e taea e te tangata te tūhura i ētahi atu ao** (Humans cannot discover other worlds) - The passage implies the opposite – that travel to other stars and worlds is a possibility, even if distant.
* **D: He iti iho i te piriona kiromita te tawhiti i waenganui i ngā whetū** (The distance between stars is less than a trillion kilometers) - The passage states the distances are *trillions* of kilometers, not less than a trillion.



"
He aha te mea ka māmā ake i a koe e neke atu ana i te pokapū o te Rā?,"The correct answer is **A: Taitoto**.

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

""Ka iti iho te haurehu i a koe ka toro atu ai mai i te pokapū o te Rā."" 

This translates to: ""The density decreases as you move away from the center of the Sun.""  

""Taitoto"" means density.  The text directly states density *decreases* as you move outwards, making it easier to move.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ahi (Fire):** While the sun *is* fire/heat, the text doesn't say heat makes it easier to move.
* **C: Korohū (Gas):** While the sun is mostly gas, the text focuses on *density* changing, not just the presence of gas.
* **D: Kirinuku (Skin/Surface):** The text describes the photosphere (surface) but doesn't link it to ease of movement.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea wāhanga o te rā e kitea ana i te Whenua?","The correct answer is **A: Te kirinuku**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ko te wāhanga ki waho e kitea ana e tātou i te tiro atu ki te Rā e kīia ana ko te photosphere, ko tōna tikanga ko te """"pōro o te tūrama""""."" 
* This translates to: ""The outer layer that we see when looking at the Sun is called the photosphere, which means """"sphere of light"""".
* ""Kirinuku"" translates to ""surface"" or ""outer layer,"" which directly corresponds to the photosphere described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Te taitoto** - This translates to ""the solid"" and isn't mentioned in the passage as being visible.
* **C: Te whakaahua** - This translates to ""the image"" and is not what we directly see of the sun.
* **D: Te pokapū** - This translates to ""the center"" and we don't see the center of the sun directly, only its outer layers.

Ko tehea o ngā kitenga e whai ake nei i āwhina ki te whakapumautia i te ariā a Copernicus?,"The correct answer is **A: Ko ngā wāhanga o Venus (The phases of Venus)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Galileo Galilei observed phases of Venus, *similar to the phases of the moon*. This was crucial because, according to the geocentric (Earth-centered) model, Venus should not exhibit a full range of phases.  Only a heliocentric (Sun-centered) model, like Copernicus's, could explain seeing Venus as a full disc, crescent, etc.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He whakawhiti o Venus (A transit of Venus):** While Jeremiah Horrocks observed a transit of Venus, this happened *after* the initial support for Copernicus's theory was established by Galileo's observations of Venus's phases.  Transits are confirmatory, not foundational.
* **C: Ko ngā ōritetanga o te Rā ki a Venus (The alignments of the Sun to Venus):** Alignments don't specifically prove the heliocentric model.
* **D: Ngā ritenga o te Rā ki te Marama (The alignments of the Sun to the Moon):** Alignments of the Sun and Moon are part of standard astronomical observation, but don’t directly support Copernicus’s theory over a geocentric model.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei mea i kitea e Galileo Galilei i te tau 1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Ko ngā wāhanga o Venus (The phases of Venus)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...i whakamahia e te kaimātai whetū nō Itāria a Galileo Galilei tētahi karu whātata kia kite he mata ā Kōpū, pērā i ā te marama.""  This means Galileo used a telescope to see phases of Venus, *similar to the phases of the moon*. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He taha o te Marama e anga ana ki te Rā (A side of the moon facing the sun)** - While the passage mentions the moon as a comparison, Galileo observed Venus, not the moon directly.
*   **C: E huri ana te ao i te Rā (The world revolves around the sun)** - Galileo's observations *supported* the idea that planets revolve around the sun (Copernicus's theory), but he didn't directly *see* the Earth orbiting the sun.
*   **D: He whakawhiti o Venus (A transit of Venus)** - Jeremiah Horrocks saw the transit of Venus, not Galileo.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, no hea te awa o Amazon e kohi wai ai?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā awa iti ake** (Smaller rivers).

The passage states: ""Kei te kohi ia i te wai mai i ngā tini mano awa iti iho."" which translates to ""It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Te awa tino roa** (The longest river) - While the Amazon *is* long, the passage doesn't say it collects water *from* the longest river.
* **C: Nga moana** (The oceans) - The passage states the Amazon *releases* water *to* the oceans, not that it collects from them.
* **D: Te awa nui tuarua** (The second largest river) - The passage mentions the Amazon is the second largest, but doesn't say it collects water from it.



"
Ko tēhea accolade ehara i te take ki te Awa o Amazon?,"The correct answer is **C: Ko te awa tino roa tēnei**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ko te awa Amazon te awa nunui, roroa **tuarua** o te ao"" (The Amazon River is the largest river, **second longest** in the world). 

Therefore, claiming it's the *longest* river (tino roa) is inaccurate based on the provided text.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

* **A: Ko te awa tuarua te roa** - Correct, as stated above.
* **B: Ko te awa nui rawa tēnei** - Correct, it says ""awa nunui"" (largest river).
* **D: Ko te awa tino whanui** - Correct, it says ""e ono maero te whānuitanga"" (6 kilometers wide) making it the widest.



"
Ko tehea rārangi mahi e whakahuatia ana i roto i te wāhanga e mahi ana i te iti rawa o nga Venezuelan?,"The correct answer is **A: Ahuwhenua**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...he haurima kei roto i te ahuwhenua"" (roughly translates to ""...only five percent are in agriculture""). This indicates that agriculture employs the smallest percentage of Venezuelans compared to the other options mentioned:

*   **Ratonga (Services):** ""Ko te rua hautoru Venezuela e mahi āna kei roto i te wāhanga ratonga"" (two-thirds work in the service sector).
*   **Ahumahi (Industry):** ""tata ki te koata ka mahi ki roto i te ahumahi"" (almost a quarter work in industry).
*   **Hinu (Oil):** ""kotahi ōrau anake kei te mahi ki te ahumahi hinu"" (only one percent work in the oil industry).

Therefore, agriculture (haurima - five percent) employs the fewest Venezuelans.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā wāhanga e whai ake nei e whakamahi ana i te nuinga nui rawa o ngā Venezuelan?","The correct answer is **A: Ratonga**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko tētahi rua hautoru Venezuela e mahi āna kei roto i te wāhanga ratonga..."" which translates to ""Two thirds of Venezuelans work in the service sector..."" 

This clearly indicates that the service sector employs the largest number of Venezuelans. The other options are smaller percentages: industry (nearly a quarter) and agriculture (a sixth), and oil (only 1%).



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te hononga e āhei ai ngā whetū ki te mahi?","The correct answer is **C: Hoatu te mārama me te wera** (Give light and heat).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kei te whakaputa aho, wera hoki ngā whetū..."" which translates to ""Stars emit light and are hot..."". This directly states the connection between stars and giving off light and heat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā huānga taumaha puka** (Heavy elements are created) - While the passage *mentions* heavy elements being created *by* stars, it doesn't say this is how stars *function* or their primary connection to work/activity.
*   **B: Hangaia nga reactors hanumi** (Build thermal reactors) - This refers to what scientists are *trying* to create, not what stars do.
*   **D: Waihanga ngota hauwai** (Create exotic matter) - This is also part of the process *within* stars, not the fundamental connection to their activity as described in the passage.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai hua ana hei hanga i tētahi pūkaha pūtaiao?,"The correct answer is **A: Hauwai**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""ngā ngota hauwai hei hanga i ngā pūmotu taumaha ake"" which translates to ""heavy elements to create heavier nuclei"".  This means hydrogen (hauwai) is the *source material* being fused to create those heavier elements. A science report would focus on the fundamental building blocks and processes, and in this case, that's hydrogen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ngā Whetū (Stars):**  Stars *are where* the process happens, but they aren't the material being used.
*   **C: Ngota (Nuclei):** Nuclei are the *result* of the process, not the starting material.
*   **D: Pūngao (Fusion):** Fusion is the *process* itself, not the element being used.



"
He aha te hanganga matū o te wai?,"The correct answer is **A: Kotahi ngota hauwai me ngā ngota hāora e rua** (One hydrogen atom and two oxygen atoms).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kua hangaia te pūhui wai ki ngā ngota hauwai e rua, me te ngota hāora kotahi."" which translates to ""Water molecules are made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.""  However, later it states: ""...me te ngota hāora kotahi"" which translates to ""and one oxygen atom."" This is a contradiction within the text.

However, the text clarifies, “Ko tētahi atu tauira ko te wai.” which translates to ""Another example is water."" This implies that the initial statement about two hydrogen atoms is wrong, and the subsequent statement about one oxygen atom is the accurate one. 

Therefore, the passage implies the chemical formula of water is H2O, not OH2. This makes option A the most accurate interpretation of the information provided, despite the conflicting statements within the text.



"
"Ka huri ngā āhua o te wai, he aha te mea ka noho tonu?","The correct answer is **A: hanganga rāpoi ngota** (molecular structure).

Here's why, based on the provided text:

* **The text states:** ""Ko tētahi atu tauira ko te wai... He ōrite te hanga rāpoi ngota he ahakoa he haurehu, he wē, he totoka rānei."" (Another example is water... The molecular structure is the same whether it's steam, liquid, or solid).
* **The text emphasizes:** Even though the *physical state* changes (steam, liquid, ice – referenced by ""haurehu, wē, totoka""), the underlying *molecular structure* remains consistent.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kiato (Energy):** While energy is involved in phase changes, it *is* the thing that *changes* to cause those shifts, not something that remains constant.
* **C: Āhua Ōkiko (Physical State):** The text specifically states that the physical state *changes* (""Ka huri ngā āhua o te wai"").
* **D: hauota wai (Water state):** This is too broad and doesn't pinpoint the specific unchanging element.  The water state *is* changing (from steam to liquid, etc.).



Therefore, **hanganga rāpoi ngota** (molecular structure) is the only option that consistently stays the same, as described in the text."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i te take mō ngā kāwanatanga tekau mā toru i te wa e ngana ana ki te whakatakoto i ētahi ture?","The correct answer is **A: Te arotahi kaha a ngā mana ā-iwi (The strong focus of state powers)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the states were reluctant to cooperate with the national government and prioritized their own interests. This reluctance stemmed from a desire to maintain their individual power and autonomy.  The passage says the states weren't willing to work together to enforce laws and that the Articles of Confederation required unanimous consent from all states, hindering effective governance. This all points to a strong focus on state powers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He kore mana i roto i te Whare Pāremata (Lack of power in Congress):** The passage *does* discuss Congress's lack of power (specifically, the inability to tax or enforce laws), but this is a *result* of the states' prioritizing their own power, not the primary *reason* for their unwillingness to implement rules.
* **C: Ko ngā whakarerekētanga e hiahiatia ana he whakaaetanga kotahi (Amendments requiring unanimous consent):**  While true (the passage mentions unanimous consent being needed for ratification), this is a *consequence* of the states wanting to retain control, not the root cause of their resistance to rules.
* **D: He mana whakahaere ā-motu kāore e wātea ana (Lack of available national executive power):** The lack of a national executive is mentioned, but again, this is a *symptom* of the problem (states not wanting a strong central authority), not the underlying cause of the difficulty in establishing rules.

Me pēhea te tuhi i ngā kupu i te taha o muri o te Whakapuakanga Mātauranga?,"The correct answer is **D: I roto i te momotuhi iti** (In small handwriting).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka kitea te tuhinga i raro o te tuhinga, e hurirapa ana."" (The writing is seen below the text, it is swirling.) and ""ahakoa kāore tētahi e mōhio pū nāwai i tuhi..."" (although no one knows who wrote it...). This implies the writing is small and somewhat obscured, not large or encoded.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I roto i te momotuhi nui** (In large handwriting) - The passage indicates the writing is *below* and *swirling*, suggesting smallness.
*   **B: I roto i te waehere** (In code) - The passage doesn't mention any code or encryption.
*   **C: Whakarunga Whakararo** (Fancy calligraphy) - While it *could* be fancy, the emphasis is on it being small and its unknown author.



"
Ko tehea o ngā mea e whai ake nei e mōhiotia ana a Singapore?,"The correct answer is **A: Kākāriki Taone (Garden City)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states that the skills of the Singapore Botanic Gardens helped transform the island into a ""Garden City"" (takiwā pārū). This is the defining characteristic mentioned in relation to Singapore in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Te hīkoi (Hiking):** While Singapore may have hiking trails, it's not the primary thing the passage highlights.
*   **C: Ko nga hakinakina morearea (Water sports):** The passage doesn't mention water sports.
*   **D: Ngā toi mahinga (Handicrafts/Arts and Crafts):**  The passage doesn't mention arts and crafts.



"
He aha te Vanda Miss Joaquim?,"The correct answer is **B: He putiputi** (It is a flower).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I te tau 1981, i kōwhiritia a Vanda Miss Joaquim, arā ko tētahi momorua māika, hei pua ā-motu o te whenua.""  This translates to ""In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, a hybrid orchid, was chosen as the national flower of the country.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He motu** (It is an island) - The passage talks about transforming the *island* into a garden city, but Vanda Miss Joaquim itself is not an island.
* **C: He Kāri Botanical** (It is a Botanical Card) -  This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: He whakamaharatanga ā-motu** (It is a national memorial) - While being the national flower is a form of national recognition, it's specifically identified as a flower, not a memorial.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, He aha te kounga o ngā pirimeti o Giza e kore e miharo ki ngā Ihipiana o te Emepaea Hou?","The correct answer is **D: To ratou hanga** (their construction).

Here's why:

The passage states that despite continued pyramid building through the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never *equaled* in size and technological quality of construction.  The New Kingdom Egyptians *marvelled* at these monuments of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old at that point. This implies they were impressed by *how* they were built – the construction itself – because nothing built later matched it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: to rātau pakeketanga** (their age): The passage specifically mentions the pyramids were *old* (over 1000 years), so age wouldn’t be a source of wonder.
*   **B: Te whakamahinga o te kohatu** (the use of stone): Stone was readily available and used in building throughout Egyptian history.
*   **C: to rātau rahi** (their size): While size is mentioned, the passage emphasizes both size *and* quality of construction were unmatched.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nō whea ngā kai otaota e haere mai ana ki te whai i ngā ua?","The correct answer is **B: Nga maunga ki te raki** (The mountains to the north).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ka haere atu te rahinga tata ki te 1.5 miriona kaiota ki ngā papatairite o te tonga, e whakawhiti nei i te Mara River mai i ngā puke ki te raki mō ngā ua."" 

This translates to: ""...approximately 1.5 million wildebeest travel to the southern plains, crossing the Mara River from the mountains to the north for the rains.""

Therefore, the wildebeest are coming *from* the mountains in the north to follow the rains.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, He aha te rohe e wehe atu ai ngā kai otaota i tētahi wā i te marama o Āperira?","The correct answer is **A: Te rohe Serengeti**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kia oti rā anō ngā marangai i te marama o Aperira."" (…to complete the migration in the month of April). This implies the wildebeest *leave* the Serengeti region (which includes the Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Conservation Area, and Maswa Game Reserve) *by* April.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nga mania ki te tonga (The south):** They *arrive* in the south in October, not leave from there in April.
*   **C: Te Awa o Mara (The Mara River):** They cross the Mara River twice, but it's a crossing point, not a region they depart from.
*   **D: Ko te Maasai Mara National Reserve (The Maasai Mara National Reserve):** This is where they go *to*, not where they leave *from* in April.



"
He whakaekenga a Operation Sealion ki tēhea whenua?,"The correct answer is **B: Britain**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""I tīmata a Tiamani te whakarite kia eke i te motu o Peretānia."" (Germany began preparing to invade the island of Britain.) and ""Ko te āki ki te """"Operation Sealion""""."" (The attack was called ""Operation Sealion"").

Therefore, Operation Sealion was a planned invasion *of* Britain *by* Germany.



"
He aha te ingoa o Tiamana mo te whakaeke ki Britain?,"The correct answer is **B: Whakahaere Sealion**.

The passage states: ""I whakaingoatia munangia e Tiamani te āki ki te """"Operation Sealion""""."" which translates to ""Germany named the plan to invade Britain """"Operation Sealion"""".""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dunkirk** - Dunkirk was a *battle* where British forces were evacuated, not the name of the invasion plan.
*   **C: Kriegsmarine** - This is the name of the German Navy.
*   **D: Royal Navy** - This is the British Navy.



"
He aha te mea e kore e whakahuatia hei taahiraa e hiahiatia ana i roto i te mahere a Itari ki te hopu i nga whenua o Awherika?,"The correct answer is **B: Te hanga kaipuke anō**.

Here's why:

The passage states Italy was *already* building four battleships before the war. It doesn't describe building more ships as a *required action* for their African plans. The other options *are* described as necessary:

*   **A: Te whakakore i nga kaipuke i Ihipa** - They sought to seize constructions and ships from Britain in Egypt.
*   **C: Te whakatū i tētahi papa whakarewa hoia** - Establishing bases for troops was a primary goal.
*   **D: Te whakangaro i ngā turanga o Ingarangi** - Seizing British constructions/ships in Egypt implies diminishing British presence.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te take tuatahi o Itari mo te whawhai?","The correct answer is **A: Te hopu i ngā whenua o Āwherika**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ko ngā whāinga matua a Itaria ko ō Awherika whenua. Kia riro i ēnā whenua..."" (The main goals of Italy were those of African lands. To gain those lands...). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While Italy wanted a stronger military, the passage says they *lacked* strength and were only building a few ships.  It wasn't their primary goal *for* the fight, but a capability they needed to achieve it.
* **C:** The passage states they attacked structures and ships *in* Egypt, not that destroying Egyptian ships was a primary goal.
* **D:** They attacked British structures in Egypt, not to dismantle British bases, but to facilitate their access to Africa.



"
Ko wai i whakapūmau i ngā whanaungatanga hoa ki ngā kaiwhawhai?,"The correct answer is **B: Te Wīwī Vichy**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""I whakaturengia e te """"Vichy"""" Wīwi. He tangata Wīwi ēnei i hou te rongo me ngā Tiamani i te 1940, ā, i mahi tahi me ngā kaiwhawhai tēnā i te whawhai i a rātou."" 

This translates to: ""The """"Vichy"""" French established it. These were French people who had good relations with the Germans in 1940, and worked with the fighters to fight them.""

This clearly indicates that the Vichy French had friendly relations with the Germans (the ""fighters"" they fought *against* the Allies with).



"
Ko wai nga Allies i roto i te Mahi Tarakona?,"The correct answer is **A: Ko ngā Amerikana me ngā Wīwī Koreutu** (The Americans and the Free French).

The text specifically states: ""I roto i ngā wiki e rua noa i wetekina e ngā Amerikana me ngā hōia Wīwī Free French te tonga o Wīwī..."" (In just two weeks the Americans and the Free French soldiers liberated the south of France...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ko nga Wīwī Vichy me nga Amerikana** - The Vichy French *collaborated* with the Germans, they didn't liberate France *with* the Americans.
* **C: Nga Tiamana me te Wīwī** - The Germans were the enemy, not allies in liberating France.
* **D: Ko ngā Amerikana me ngā Tiamana** - Again, the Germans were the enemy.



"
Na te whanaketanga o te hangarau i tīmata ai ngā kaipuke moana ki te haere i raro i te wai?,"The correct answer is **B: Te awhe pupuhi (Propulsion)**. 

Here's why:

The passage states that the development of **radar** (irirangi whakaata) led to submarines being sunk to avoid detection.  Radar didn't *make* them go underwater, but it made staying *on* the surface too dangerous.  The technology that allowed them to stay underwater for extended periods and operate effectively was **propulsion** – the technology to move and breathe underwater. While U-boats are mentioned, they *are* the submarines, not the technology that allowed them to operate underwater.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: U-Boats:** These are the *name* of the German submarines, not the technology enabling underwater travel.
*   **C: Te Whakatere (Navigation):**  While important, navigation doesn't explain *how* they stayed underwater.
*   **D: Hihiani (Espionage):** This relates to spying, not the mechanics of submarine operation.



"
"I te wā o to rātau whakamahinga tuatahi, he iti rawa te whānuitanga o ngā kaipuke moana i roto i tehea rohe?","The correct answer is **C: Te pupuhi** (ammunition/shelling).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I ērā rā he pōturi ngā waka nei, ā, kāore nei e tino whānui te pūhitanga o ngā pū."" This translates to ""In those days the ships were small, and the firepower of the guns wasn't very extensive.""  

* **Te pupuhi** directly refers to the ammunition or the firing of guns, representing the ""firepower"" mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Te whakatere** (navigation) - While submarines *require* navigation, the passage isn't talking about the skill of navigation itself.
* **B: Haereere** (travel/journey) - This is too general. The passage is about capabilities, not just the act of moving.
* **D: whakahaere** (management/operation) -  This is also too broad. The passage specifically refers to the *amount* of firepower, not how the submarines were operated.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nāna i tūkino te whakaaetanga? ","The correct answer is **D: Te Soviets**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Soviet Union broke several treaties: ""the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, between the two countries, or multiple countries.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te Pōrana (Poland):** The passage states Poland's defenses were *broken through*, not that they broke the agreements.
*   **B: Nga Romaniana (Romania):** Romania is mentioned in relation to negotiations, but not as a treaty breaker.
*   **C: Te Ukrainians (Ukraine):** While Ukrainian territory was involved, the passage specifically names the *Soviet Union* as the treaty violator.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i mahia e te Rōpū Whero?,"The correct answer is **A: Te hanganga o tētahi mua Ākarana** (The establishment of a forward base).

Here's why:

The passage states the Red Army *moved* over 800,000 troops into Belorussian and Ukrainian territories, *violating* treaties. It describes aggressive actions – moving troops, breaking agreements, and entering territories.

Let's look at the options:

*   **B: He whakaekenga o nga rohe ki te rāwhiti** (An invasion of eastern territories) - This is explicitly stated in the passage (""eke ki ngā rohe rāwhiti o Pōrana"" - entered the eastern regions of Poland).
*   **C: He whakarerekētanga i te taha o te rori** (A change in the direction of advance) - The movement *is* the advance, so this is implied.
*   **D: He Hara Tiriti** (A treaty violation) - The passage specifically says they broke the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other treaties (""takahi i te Riga Peace Treaty...me ētahi atu tiriti ā-ao"").

*   **A: Te hanganga o tētahi mua Ākarana** (The establishment of a forward base) - The passage focuses on the *movement* of troops, not on *establishing* a base beforehand. While they might have used existing bases or later established them, the text doesn't mention this as an action they took.



Therefore, **A** is the only option not supported by the information in the passage."
He aha te mea i tupu ki te Engineer-i-Chief o te Italian Tenth Army?,"The correct answer is **C: I hopukina a ia e te Ingarangi** (He was captured by the British).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ki tētahi manukāwhaki ki te rāwhiti o Bardia, i mau i a Peretānia te Tenth Army's Engineer-in-Chief nō Itāria, a General Lastucci."" This translates to ""At a bird observation post east of Bardia, the British captured the Italian Tenth Army's Engineer-in-Chief, General Lastucci.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I hopukina a ia i Fort Capuzzo** - While Fort Capuzzo was mentioned, Lastucci was captured *near* Bardia, not at Capuzzo.
*   **B: I patua a ia i Tobruk** - Marshal Balbo was killed in Tobruk, not General Lastucci.
*   **D: I patua a ia e te ahi ratarata** - The text doesn't mention Lastucci being killed by artillery fire.



"
I hea i patua ai a Italo Balbo?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk**.

The text states: ""Nō te 28 o Hune, nā ngā pū i Tobruk i mate ai a Marshal Italo Balbo..."" which translates to ""On June 28th, shots in Tobruk killed Marshal Italo Balbo..."".

Therefore, Italo Balbo was killed in Tobruk."

*   **B: Ngā mahi tukurua** - This isn’t mentioned as a central practice.
*   **D: Ngā Poutāpeta o te ioka matua** - While the passage mentions the influence of Indian yoga, it doesn't state that specific poses are a central part of Tibetan Buddhist thought. It mentions them within Kundalini Yoga which is *different* from Tibetan Buddhism.

The passage specifically states: ""...mā te whakaaro ā-ataata ki ngā tini atua ka whakawāteatia ngā ia ngoi, ka kāngia ngā hakara..."" This translates to ""...by vividly visualizing numerous deities, the subtle energies are stirred, the chakras are activated...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na roto i ngā tūnga yoga rerekē** (Through different yoga postures) - While yoga postures are mentioned in the context of Kundalini Yoga, the passage doesn't connect them directly to activating chakras *within the core of Tibetan thought* (Deity Yoga).
*   **C: Ko te tukurua o nga mantra** (The repetition of mantras) - Mantras are mentioned in Kundalini Yoga, but not specifically linked to chakra activation in Tibetan Deity Yoga according to this passage.
*   **D: Te whakatinana i ngā whakangungu manawa** (Performing mindfulness exercises) - Mindfulness isn't mentioned as a direct mechanism for chakra activation in this excerpt.



"
Ko wai i whakatangi i te waiata tapu tuarua i te hōtaka?,"The correct answer is **D: Jai Shankar Choudhary**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""I tīmata te kaiwaiata a Sanju Sharma i taua pō, whai muri mai ko Shankar Choudhary."" This translates to ""Sanju Sharma started singing that night, followed by Shankar Choudhary."" 

Therefore, Shankar Choudhary (Jai Shankar Choudhary is a likely full name variation) sang the second devotional song.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nāna i whakatakoto he waiata whakangākau i te wā o te whakahere kai?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""I tuku hoki a Lakkha Singh i te chhappan bhog bhajan.""  ""Chhappan bhog bhajan"" is described as being presented *during* the offering of the 108 items of Chhappan Bhog, which is part of the feast/ceremony. Therefore, Lakkha Singh performed a devotional song during the offering.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jai Shankar Choudhary:** He sang earlier in the evening, but not specifically *during* the offering.
*   **C: Shri Shyam:** Shri Shyam is the deity being honored, not a singer.
*   **D: Sanju Sharma:** He sang at the beginning of the evening, but not during the offering.



"
He aha te whakaaturanga tuarua whakamutunga o te ahiahi?,"The correct answer is **A: Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina me Haris Alexiou**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I whakangāhau tahi te diva Sezen Aksu o Tūki me te tena Itariana me Alessandro Safina me te kaiwaiata Kiriki me Haris Alexiou."" This directly precedes the final performance by Fire of Anatolia.  Therefore, Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina and Haris Alexiou performed the second to last show.



"
He aha te iwi o Alessandro Safina?,"The correct answer is **D: Reo Itāria**.

The passage states ""te tena Itariana me Alessandro Safina..."" which translates to ""the Italian tenor Alessandro Safina..."". Therefore, Alessandro Safina is Italian."
"I runga anō i tēnei wāhanga, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei ehara i te mea pono?","The correct answer is **A: Tērā tētahi ahi i Hana Clara** (There was a fire in Hana Clara).

Here's why:

* **The passage states the fire was in Santa Clara,** not Hana Clara. This makes option A the incorrect statement.

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct based on the passage:

* **B: I mau nga tāngata ki runga i te takutai hurihuri** (People were stuck on the rotating platform) - The passage mentions people waiting on a 90(f)-degree rotating platform.
* **C: I hoatu he wai ki nga pāhihi** (Water was given to the people) - The first sentence explicitly states water was given to people.
* **D: E 60 meneti te roa ki te tiki i te tangata tuatahi i te waka** (It took 60 minutes to get the first person off the ride) -  The passage says ""kotahi hāora i te itinga iho te wā kia puta atu te tangata tuatahi i te waka"" which translates to ""it took an hour for the first person to get off the ride.""



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nāna i kōrero e pā ana ki te taumata wera haumaru?","The correct answer is **B: Te kāpene ahi** (The fire captain).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I kī te rangatira o te ahi a Scott Kouns..."" which translates to ""The fire captain Scott Kouns said..."".  Scott Kouns then goes on to describe the hot weather and the dangers it presents. Therefore, the fire captain is the one speaking about the heat and safety concerns.



"
I hea i puta ai te mate hiko nā te mahi o te tsunami?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kāore he kinonga nui, he whara rānei i rīpoatangia ki Tonga, heoi i ngaro te hiko..."" which translates to ""No major damage or injuries were reported in Tonga, but the power went out...""  The power outage is directly linked to Tonga in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Niue:** The text mentions a tsunami was recorded near Niue, but doesn't say the power went out *in* Niue.
*   **C: Nga kura i Hawaii:** The text mentions schools were closed, but not that they experienced a power outage.
*   **D: Pago Pago:** Similar to Niue, Pago Pago had a tsunami recorded nearby, but no power outage is mentioned there.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i pēhea te pānga o Tonga e te Outage hiko?","The correct answer is **D: Kāore i taea e ngā mana whakahaere te whiwhi i ngā whakatūpato e hāngai ana** (The authorities were unable to receive the relevant warnings).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...i ngaro te hiko, ā, nā tenei i ngaro hoki te kaha kia rongo ai i te ohoreretanga mai i te PTWC e pā ana ki te tsunami."" This directly translates to ""...the power went out, and because of this, they also lost the ability to hear the announcement from the PTWC regarding the tsunami.""  This means the power outage *prevented* authorities from receiving warnings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tērā ētahi tūkinotanga i pūrongotia** (There were some disruptions reported) - While disruptions *occurred* (schools closed), the passage specifically links the power outage to the inability to receive warnings, not general disruptions.
*   **B: Kāore ngā mana whakahaere i whiwhi kōrero mō ngā whakatūpato kua tangohia** (The authorities did not receive information about the warnings that had been taken) - The passage states they *couldn't hear* the warnings, not that they didn't receive information about warnings already issued.
*   **C: I pāngia ngā pānuitanga taumata moana** (Sea level readings were affected) - The passage doesn't mention sea level readings being affected.



"
Nō whea i taea ai e te pirihimana te whakamahi i ō rātou pupuhi radar hei tātai i te tere o te taraiwa a Jonny Reid?,"The correct answer is **A: I a ia e taraiwa ana i te 160km/h**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I raru ngā pirihimana o Aotearoa i te whakamahi i ā rātou pū hihiani tere kia kite i te tere a Matua Reid i runga i te pāpaku o Black Beauty, ā, ko te wā anake i oti i ngā pirihimana te ine i Matua Reid ko te wā i heke tana pōturi ki te 160km/h.""  This translates to: ""The New Zealand police struggled to use their speed guns to measure Mr. Reid’s speed on the Black Beauty’s track, and the only time the police were able to catch Mr. Reid was when his speed dropped to 160km/h.""

Therefore, the police could only use their radar guns *when* he was driving at 160km/h.



"
"E ai ki te whārangi, he aha i uaua ai te pirihimana o Aotearoa ki te whakarite i te tere o Jonny Reid?","The correct answer is **B: He tino hakahaka te motokā** (The car was very fast).

Here's why:

The passage states the police had trouble getting a speed reading on Jonny Reid *until* his speed dropped to 160km/h. This implies his speed was *above* what their speed guns could accurately measure, meaning the car was exceptionally fast.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I te taraiwa a ia i raro i te 160km/h** (He was driving under 160km/h) - The passage says the police *finally* got a reading *at* 160km/h, not under it.
*   **C: E whitu noa iho tana taraiwa i runga i te piriti** (He only drove across the bridge seven times) - The number of crossings doesn't explain why it was hard to measure his speed.
*   **D: He tino tawhito te Piriti Tauranga o Auckland** (The Auckland Harbour Bridge is very old) - The age of the bridge isn't relevant to the speed measurement issue.



"
He aha te wāhi o te rū e pā ana ki Butte?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 maire ki te tonga**.

The text states: ""Ko te pokapū o te rū whenua ko te tata ki te 65 km (40 maero) ki te tonga o Butte."" which translates to ""The epicenter of the earthquake was approximately 65 km (40 miles) south of Butte."""
He aha i puta i te wa o te tutu i Abu Ghraib?,"The correct answer is **A: Te tukino mauhere (Prisoner abuse)**.

The passage explicitly states ""te tūkino tangata herehere"" (prisoner abuse) occurred at Abu Ghraib and led to the scandal. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maukati Whakararo (Roadblocks)** - Not mentioned in the passage.
* **C: I whai mana ngā tōpana o Amerika (American soldiers took control)** - While true, this *led* to the abuse, it wasn't *what* happened during the turmoil. The turmoil was the abuse itself.
* **D: I whakatūria te whare herehere ki runga i te ahi (The prison was set on fire)** - Not mentioned in the passage.



"
He aha i rongonui ai te whare herehere o Iraki? ,"The correct answer is **D: Te kitenga o te tūkinotanga hoa noho** (The discovery of prisoner abuse).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Abu Ghraib prison became infamous *after* the revelation of prisoner abuse by US forces. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I whakatūria ki runga i te ahi** (It was set on fire) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the prison being burned.
*   **B: I tangohia e ngā ope US te mana** (US forces took control) - While true, this isn't *why* it became infamous. Control was taken before the abuse came to light.
*   **C: He maha nga ngangau** (Many complaints) - While there likely were complaints, the passage focuses on the *revelation of abuse* as the reason for its notoriety.



"
He aha te momo huihuinga i tū ki te War Memorial Stadium o Maui?,"The correct answer is **C: Konohete**. 

Here's why:

The passage states the event was a ""whakangahau"" at the War Memorial Stadium in Maui, expecting 9,000 attendees and outreach to sponsors. ""Whakangahau"" translates to a show or concert. A ""konohete"" is a concert.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Whakaaturanga makutu (Magic show):** While possible, the scale of 9,000 people and sponsor outreach suggests something larger than a magic show.
*   **B: Ōrite whutupōro (Football game):** The passage doesn't mention any sport.
*   **D: kaihoko moni (Fundraiser):** While sponsorships are involved, the primary event isn’t described as a fundraising event itself.



"
Nā wai i whakamārama e pā ana ki te whakakorenga o te takahanga?,"The correct answer is **B: Te kamupene whakahaere** (The management company).

Here's why:

The text states ""Kāore te kamupene whakahaere a te pēni, a HK Management Inc., i tuku i tētahi take tuatahi i tā rātou whakakorenga..."" which translates to ""The event's management company, HK Management Inc., did not initially provide a reason for their cancellation..."".  This directly identifies the management company as the source of information (or lack thereof) regarding the cancellation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te pēne** (The band) - The text says the *management company* didn't give a reason, not the band.
*   **C: Ko te rangatira o te War Memorial Stadium** (The owner of the War Memorial Stadium) - The text doesn't mention the stadium owner.
*   **D: Nga kaihautū** (The leaders) -  The text doesn't mention any leaders explaining the cancellation.



"
Ko wai te hunga e whakaaro ana ko etahi o nga kainoho o Bishkek te kawenga mo te pahua?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā āpiha whakaū ture** (Law enforcement officials).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I whakaaturia e tētahi kaimātakitaki ko Bishkek e totohu ana ki te āhua o te """"ture kore"""", ... I whakawhiua ngā kaiporotēhi nō te tonga e te hunga kei Bishkek e noho ana mō ā rātou mahi whakapōauau.""  This translates to: ""An observer showed that Bishkek points to a """"lawless"""" nature... Southern smugglers were blamed by those living in Bishkek for their fraudulent activities.""

The people doing the blaming – those accusing the Bishkek residents of being responsible for the fraud – are implicitly law enforcement or those expecting law enforcement to act.  They are essentially saying there's a lack of law and order *and* blaming locals for taking advantage of it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ngā rangatira pātaka** (Bank managers) - The passage doesn't mention bank managers.
*   **C: Ngā kaiwhakahaere** (Administrators) - While administrators *might* be involved, the passage focuses on a general blame placed by people within Bishkek.
*   **D: taitamariki** (Youth) - The passage doesn't specify youth as the ones doing the blaming.



"
Ko wai i whakapae i nga kaiwhakahaere o te tonga mo te parakete?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā tangata whenua o Bishkek** (The people of Bishkek).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I whakawhiua ngā kaiporotēhi nō te tonga e te hunga kei Bishkek e noho ana mō ā rātou mahi whakapōauau.""  This translates to ""Southern merchants were accused by those living in Bishkek for their speculative practices.""

Therefore, the people *living in Bishkek* are the ones doing the accusing. Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngā āpiha whakaū ture** (Legal enforcement officers) - The passage states they *weren't* present, contributing to the lawlessness.
* **C: Anarchists** -  While the situation is described as ""lawless"", the passage doesn't specifically mention anarchists.
* **D: Ngā rōpū tāngata** (Human groups) - Too vague; the passage specifies the residents of Bishkek.



"
No hea i nui ake ai te hokohoko o te wheako rīngi?,"The correct answer is **A: I muri iho i tētahi āhuatanga i Shark Tank**.

The passage states: ""I kī a Siminoff i piki ake ngā hokonga whai muri i tana putanga i te hōtaka Shark Tank i te tau 2013..."" (Siminoff said sales increased after his appearance on the show Shark Tank in 2013...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I muri i te whiwhinga pūtea i te tau 2013** - The passage specifically states they *didn't* receive funding from Shark Tank.
* **C: I muri i tētahi āhua i QVC** - While he *was* on QVC, the passage doesn't say sales increased *because* of it.
* **D: I muri i te whakatau i tētahi rīpoata ki te ADT** - The passage mentions a legal issue with ADT, but not that it increased sales.



"
I te wā i whakatau ai a Jamie Siminoff ki te tīmata i te Ring?,"The correct answer is **A: Whai muri i te kitenga i tōna pere o te tatau ehara i te mea tika** (After realizing his doorbell wasn't working properly).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""i tīmata te kamupene i te wā kāore tāna pere kuaha i te rangona mai i tana toa ki tōna karāti."" (the company started when his doorbell wasn't ringing from his store to his car). This directly indicates the *reason* he started the company.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: I muri i te āhua o Shark Tank i rahua** (After the unsuccessful appearance on Shark Tank) - While Shark Tank *boosted* sales later, it wasn't the initial reason for starting the company.
*   **C: I muri i te whiwhinga o te pūtea** (After receiving funding) - He didn't receive funding *before* starting, in fact he was rejected on Shark Tank.
*   **D: Whai muri i te putanga angitu o QVC** (After a successful QVC appearance) - QVC came *after* the company was already established.



"
I whakawhiwhia e ia wāhanga o Reading Rainbow ngā taunakitanga a ngā tamariki mō te aha?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngā Pukapuka (Books)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka tukuna hoki e ia hōtaka ngā tautohu pukapuka me rapu e ngā tamariki hei ā rātou taenga atu ki te whare pukapuka."" This translates to ""Each episode also provided book suggestions for children to look for when they went to the library."" 

Therefore, each segment of Reading Rainbow offered recommendations *for books*.



"
He aha pea te take i whakakorea ai te raupapa Reading Rainbow?,"The correct answer is **A: He iti rawa te pūtea**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""**Kei te whakapono ētahi, pēnei hoki i a Hone Grant, ko te kohinga pūtea me te rerekētanga o te kaupapa ako o te tīwī i oti ai te terenga.**""  This translates to: ""Some, like John Grant, believe that the *funding collection and the changing educational focus of television* led to the end of the series.""

This directly points to a lack of funding as a key reason for the cancellation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: te kore tohu o te Emmy** - The passage states Reading Rainbow *won* many Emmy awards (""He nui ake i te ruatekau mā whā ngā paraihe Emmy..."").
* **C: Te whakaaro o Hoani Grant** - While John Grant is quoted, his opinion *explains* the reason (funding), it isn't the reason *itself*.
* **D: Ko te angitu o Mister Rogers' Neighborhood** - The passage mentions Mister Rogers' Neighborhood but doesn't suggest its success caused Reading Rainbow to end.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te tautohe i puta mai i ngā rangatira o Amsterdam me te whare taonga e pā ana ki te rākau?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka hinga tērā (It will fall)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""… nā tā rātou tautohe ka tūpono hinga taua rākau"" - ""...due to their dispute, the tree is at risk of falling.""  This directly shows a concern that the tree *will* fall.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ko te tikanga kia tiakina (The intention is to protect it):** The passage says they *tried* to have it removed, not protected.
* **C: Kua tāhaetia ki Fungus (It has been infected with fungus):** The passage states the tree is affected by fungus, but this isn't a dispute or argument *between* the officials. It's a *reason* for the dispute.
* **D: He mōrearea ki te hauora tūmatanui (A concern for public safety):** While public safety is implied, it's a *result* of the dispute, not the dispute itself.



"
"E ai ki tētahi kaitiaki matua mō te RSPCA, he aha te mea e tika ana kia tirohia?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā kāmera CCTCV** (CCTV cameras).

Here's why:

The passage states David O'Shannessy (a senior RSPCA officer) believes ""tūtai me te mātai i ngā whare patu kararehe ki Ahitereiria"" (monitoring and surveillance of animal shelters in Australia) should be allowed. He specifically mentions CCTV (""Ka mātua tukuna e te CCTV..."") as a powerful message to those working with animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tetahi tangata e mahi ana ki ngā kararehe** (A person working with animals) - While the CCTV is *about* people working with animals, it's not the thing that should be monitored itself.
* **C: Ngā tāutanga Surveillance** (Surveillance installations) - This is too broad. The specific type of surveillance (CCTV) is what's being advocated for.
* **D: Abattoirs** (Slaughterhouses) - The passage focuses on *animal shelters* (whare patu kararehe), not slaughterhouses.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te āwhina ki te whakakaha i te hiranga o te oranga ora kararehe ki nga kaimahi o Ahitereiria?","The correct answer is **A: Te tāutanga o ngā kāmera CCTV** (The installation of CCTV cameras).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that CCTV ""will send a strong message to people working with animals that their welfare is paramount.""  This directly links CCTV installation to reinforcing the importance of animal welfare to workers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngā hui whakahau me RSPCA** (Meetings with RSPCA) - While the RSPCA is advocating for the cameras, the passage doesn't say *meetings* strengthen the importance of welfare.
* **C: Ngā tirohanga abattoir auau** (Frequent abattoir visits) - The passage focuses on animal shelters, not abattoirs (slaughterhouses).
* **D: Tērā pea mai i te ABC** (Perhaps from the ABC) - The ABC is simply reporting the news; it doesn't *strengthen* the importance of animal welfare.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mahi a te tangata i hopukina?","The correct answer is **A: Ākonga (Student)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...i mauheretia tētahi **tauira** e hono ana ki ngā pūhitanga..."" which translates to ""...a **student** connected to the shootings...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: He kairipoata nō te Minneapolis Star-Tribune (A reporter from the Minneapolis Star-Tribune):** The reporter *received* information, they weren't the one arrested.
*   **C: Manukura ā iwi (Tribal leader):** The text identifies Louis Jourdain as the son of a tribal chairman, but *he* is the one arrested, not a leader himself.
*   **D: He mana i te Roto Whero (Authority in Red Lake):** The text says authorities made the arrest, but the arrested person isn't described as being *an* authority.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i te wā e hora ana te rongo mo tētahi atu hopunga, ka puritia nga nehunga mo te tokomaha o nga tūpāpaku?","The correct answer is **B: Toru (Three)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...i te hapori o Red Lake i tēnei rā ki ngā tangihanga mō Jeff Wise me te **toru** o ngā tokoiwa i patua..."" 

This translates to ""...in the Red Lake community today for the funerals of Jeff Wise and **three** of the nine killed...""

Therefore, the passage specifically mentions three victims in addition to Jeff Wise when discussing the recent events and arrests.



"
"Hei whakautu ki ngā whakahe, ko tēhea whenua kāore i haere whakamua ki tana kirimana ACTA kua hainatia?","The correct answer is **B: Pōrana**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""I te marama kua hipa, he nunui ngā porotēhi i Pōrana i te hāinatanga o te ACTA e taua whenua, me te aha kua whakatau ake te kāwanatanga Pōrana kia kauaka te kirimana e whakamana, mō tēnei wā.""  This directly translates to ""Last month, there were large protests in Poland against the signing of ACTA by that country, and as a result the Polish government decided to postpone ratification of the treaty, for the time being.""

This indicates Poland *did not* proceed with its signed ACTA agreement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tiamana** - The text describes protests *in* Germany, but doesn't say Germany didn't proceed with ACTA.
*   **C: Scotland** - Scotland is part of the UK, and the text mentions protests in Edinburgh and Glasgow (Scotland), but doesn't say Scotland specifically halted ACTA.
*   **D: Rituania** - The text mentions protests in Vilnius (Lithuania), but doesn't state Lithuania halted ACTA.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko ēhea o ngā whenua e whai ake nei i whakatau kia whakatārewa i te tukanga uru ki ACTA?","The correct answer is **D: Latvia**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ko tā Latvia me Slovakia whakauru ki te ACTA."" This translates to ""Latvia and Slovakia extended to join ACTA."" This means they decided to proceed with the process of joining ACTA.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Etōnia** - The text states ""Tallinn ki Etitōnia"" as a location of protests, but doesn't mention any decision about ACTA.
*   **B: Rituania** - The text states ""ki Vilnius ki Rituānia"" as a location of protests, but doesn't mention any decision about ACTA.
*   **C: Scotland** - The text states ""Edinburgh me Glasgow ki Kōtirana"" as a location of protests, but doesn't mention any decision about ACTA.



"
E hia ngā tāngata i whara i te mutunga o ngā aitua whakawera rawa o te iPod?,"The correct answer is **B: 27**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ko te Minita mō te ohaoha o Hapani...i kī kua mōhio ki ngā aituā e 27 e hono ana ki ngā pūhiko."" (The Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents connected to the batteries.)

This directly answers the question about how many people were injured as a result of the overheating iPod incidents. While there are mentions of 6 fires and later 34 additional issues, the text specifically links *27 incidents* to injuries.



"
Ko wai i kī ko ngā aitua whakawera nui kāore i tino nui?,"The correct answer is **D: Apple**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I tērā wiki i kī a METI kua whakamōhiotia ia e Apple mō ngā weranga e 34 tāpiri kua pāngia atu, i runga i tā rātou kī """"kāore i te aha"""".""  This translates to ""Last week METI said it was informed by Apple about an additional 34 issues affected, according to their statement """"nothing to do with it"""".

This directly shows Apple downplaying the severity of the issues (""kāore i te aha"" - nothing to do with it), meaning they said the incidents weren't significant.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: METI:** METI *reported* what Apple said, they didn't make the statement about the fires being minor.
*   **B: Ko nga rangatira iPod e pā ana ki:** The iPod owners were affected *by* the fires, they didn't comment on their severity.
*   **C: Te tari ahi o Tiapanī:** The fire department is not mentioned as commenting on the scale of the issues.



"
"I a ia e korero ana, he aha ta Steve Jobs i kii ai ka whakahoutia e Apple?","The correct answer is **B: Te Waea** (The phone).

Here's why:

The text states Steve Jobs said, """"I te rā nei ka whakahoungia e Apple te waea, ka maumaharatia mō ake tonu atu te rā nei."" which translates to ""Today Apple is reinventing the phone, and today will be remembered forever.""

Therefore, he specifically said Apple was reinventing **the phone**.



"
He aha te take o te kōrero e rua haora a Steve Jobs?,"The correct answer is **C: Hei whakarewa waea hōu** (To launch a new phone).

Here's why:

The text states: ""I te rā nei ka whakahoungia e Apple te waea, ka maumaharatia mō ake tonu atu te rā nei."" which translates to ""Today Apple is reinventing the phone and today will be remembered forever."" 

Steve Jobs' two-hour presentation was specifically to unveil the new iPhone. The other options are incorrect as the text focuses solely on the phone launch.



"
He aha te korero a Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner i te Whare Tapere o Argentina?,"The correct answer is **B: Ko tōna whakaaro kia oma mo te Senate**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...arā ko te wāhi i whakamahia e ia hei tīmata i tana tautohe i te tau 2005 mō te Senate hei mema o te apatono ā-takiwā o Buenos Aires.""  This translates to ""...that is, the place she used to launch her campaign in 2005 for the Senate as a member of the Buenos Aires district.""

Therefore, she announced her intention to run for Senate at the Argentine Theatre.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tōna mana whakahaere (Her leadership):** The passage doesn't mention her leadership at the theatre.
*   **C: Ko tana pakanga mo te roopu kawanatanga o Buenos Aires (Her fight for the Buenos Aires governing party):** While she's from that district, the passage focuses on her *Senate* campaign, not a party fight.
*   **D: Ko tōna mahere kia wehe atu hei heamana o nāianei (Her plan to step down as the current president):** The passage is about *launching* a campaign, not stepping down.



"
I whakapuaki a Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner i tōna hiahia ki te oma?,"The correct answer is **B: I te whare tapere o Buenos Aires i La Plata**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""I whakapuaki a Mrs. Kirchner i tana takune ki te tono i te tūranga perehitene ki te Argentine Theatre, arā ko te wāhi i whakamahia e ia hei tīmata i tana tautohe i te tau 2005..."" (Mrs. Kirchner announced her intention to run for president at the Argentine Theatre, the same place she used to launch her campaign in 2005...)
* **The passage also states:** ""...ki La Plata, he taone 50 kiromita (31 maero) nei te tawhiti atu i Buenos Aires."" ( ...to La Plata, a city 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires).  This means the Argentine Theatre is *in* La Plata, but is linked to her campaign launch *from* Buenos Aires.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Incorrect – it only mentions the distance, not *where* she announced.
* **C:** Incorrect – The passage mentions Argentina, not Australia (""Ahitereiria"").
* **D:** Incorrect – While the announcement was *in* La Plata, the phrasing in the passage connects it to a previous campaign launch *from* Buenos Aires.



"
He aha ngā kitenga a ACMA e pā ana ki Big Brother?,"The correct answer is **A: Kāore anō kia Takahitia ngā ture whakatau** (No rules have been breached yet).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**kāore a Big Brother i takahi i ngā ture rāhui whakaaturanga**"" which translates to ""Big Brother did not breach the broadcasting standards.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I kitea he pāpāho i rokiroki i runga i te paetukutuku a Big Brother** (A broadcast was found stored on the Big Brother website) - The passage specifically states the content *wasn't* published on Big Brother's website, which is why they weren't in breach.
* **C: Kua pakaru ngā ture whakatau** (The standards rules have been broken) - This is the opposite of what the passage says.
* **D: I kitea te ihirangi e noho ana i runga i tētahi tūmau** (The content was found to be residing on a server) - While the passage *mentions* content needing to be on a server to be considered an internet standard broadcast, this isn't the *finding* about Big Brother specifically. It's a general rule.



"
He aha ngā tawhā me āhei ai ngā pāpāho ki te whakaarohia he ihirangi ipurangi?,"The correct answer is **B: Me noho tinana ki runga i te tūmau**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...hei kiko Ipurangi, me noho ā-tinana ki tētahi tūmau."" ( ""...to be considered internet content, it must physically reside on a server."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Me roma ki te ipurangi:** While content needs to be *on* the internet, simply being online isn't enough.
*   **C: Kāore e taea te penapena ki tētahi paetukutuku:** The passage actually implies the opposite – that the fact it *wasn't* published on Big Brother's website helped them avoid breaching the rules.
*   **D: Me whakaae e te ACMA:** The ACMA *assesses* breaches, but doesn't *grant* internet content status.



"
Ko wai te kaiārahi o te Pāti Liberal o Ahitereiria?,"The correct answer is **B: John Howard**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...and he is the man likely to succeed Prime Minister John Howard as Liberal leader."" This directly identifies John Howard as the current leader of the Liberal Party.

While Peter Costello *may* succeed him, he isn't the current leader. The other options (John Kerr and Malcolm Fraser) are not mentioned in the text and were past Prime Ministers/leaders, not current ones at the time of this statement.



"
He aha i kore ai e whai ahumahi pūngao karihi a Ahitereiria?,"The correct answer is **A: Kei te kore tautoko tūmatanui (There is a lack of major support)**.

Here's why:

The passage states, """"Karekau he whakahē a kaupapa mo te karihi"""" (There is no policy objection to nuclear) indicating the *lack of opposition* is not the problem. Peter Costello is *advocating for* the industry, suggesting it *should* be pursued if economically viable.  This implies the main issue is a lack of widespread support (""taukoko tūmatanui"") to actually make it happen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He tautohetohe rawa (It is too controversial):** While nuclear power *can* be controversial, the passage doesn't highlight controversy as the barrier. Costello states there's no policy objection.
* **C: He mōrearea rawa (It is too difficult):** The passage focuses on economic viability and support, not difficulty.
* **D: He utu nui rawa (It is too expensive):**  Costello says it should be pursued *if* economically viable, meaning cost is a factor, but not the primary reason for its absence, according to the passage.



"
Ko wai te kaieke ski i whakataetae me te āwhina a tētahi kaiarahi?,"The correct answer is **D: Anna Ogarzynska**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...me te kaiārahi a Anna Ogarzynska i oti tekau mā toru i te Super-G."" This directly translates to ""...and the guide Anna Ogarzynska finished thirteenth in the Super-G."" This indicates Anna Ogarzynska was competing *with* a guide.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Anna Jochemsen** - The text only mentions her winning a crown, not competing with a guide.
*   **B: Jong Seork Park** - The text simply states his finishing position, no guide is mentioned.
*   **C: Maciej Krezel** - The text mentions he is a retired skier, but doesn't indicate he was skiing with a guide in this context.



"
Ko tēhea whenua i whakaoti i te tekau o ngā whakataetae Super-G mō ngā wāhine e tū ana?,"The correct answer is **B: Hōrana (Poland)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ko tā Pōrana kaieke retireti tāne kua hauā te ataata a Maciej Krezel, me te kaiārahi a Anna Ogarzynska i oti tekau mā toru i te Super-G."" This translates to ""The Polish male skier Maciej Krezel retired with a smile, and the leader Anna Ogarzynska finished thirteenth in the Super-G.""  While it doesn't directly say they *won* 10th place, it indicates Poland (Pōrana) had a participant (Anna Ogarzynska) in the Super-G competition for women.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Whinarana (Hungary):** Not mentioned in the text.
*   **Australia:** Mentioned with Mitchell Gourley finishing 11th in the men’s Super-G.
*   **Mehiko (Mexico):** Mentioned with Arly Velasquez finishing 15th in the men’s Super-G.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea kōrero mo Blake ehara i te tika?","The correct answer is **B: I whakaae a ia ki te whakaeke** (He confessed to the attack).

Here's why:

* **The passage states Blake *denied* the charges.** (""I whakahē marika te kaiwhakataki"" - the defendant denied the charges).  This directly contradicts the statement that he confessed.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

* **A: I hopukina a ia i te tirohanga** (He was arrested at the scene) - The text mentions he was ""held at the location"" where the incident occurred.
* **C: I whakamahia e ia he pou i te wa o te whakaeke** (He used a stick during the attack) - The text says he claimed to have used something to defend himself ""from the barrage of missiles thrown by the 30 people."" While not specifically a 'stick', it implies a defensive weapon.
* **D: I kī a ia kua makaia nga pounamu ki a ia** (He said stones were thrown at him) - The text explicitly states ""nga pātara e whiua ana e te tāngata"" (missiles thrown by the people).



"
"I runga anō i te wāhanga, ko tēhea o ngā mea e whai ake nei kāore i puta ki a Blake?","The correct answer is **C: I whakaekea ia ki te pou** (He was hit with a pole).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Blake was defending himself from poles being thrown at him by a group of 30 people. This means *others* were hitting *at* him with poles, not that he was hitting a pole himself.
* **The passage does state:**
    * **A: I kitea kua hara ia mo te whakapohehe i te tika** (He was found guilty of perverting the course of justice) - ""...i mau tangetange a Blake o te ngana ki te whakatapeha i te rerenga manatika.""
    * **B: I hopukina a ia** (He was arrested) - ""...i tū te whakawānga ki te Birmingham Crown Court..."" implies he was arrested to get to court.
    * **D: I korerotia ki a ia tērā pea ka tukuna ia ki te whare herehere** (He was told he was close to being sent to prison) - ""...i whakī atu te kaiwhakawā ki a Blake he """"tata taketake"""" tana whiu atu ki te whare herehere.""



Therefore, the only option not explicitly mentioned as happening *to* Blake is being hit *by* a pole."
He aha e kore ai e whakamahia te tahua o te UN mō te pāmahana o te ao?,"The correct answer is **A: whakaputa kai** (food production).

Here's why:

The passage states the funding *can* be used for things like coastal defenses, better water management, and expanding sustainable agriculture (food production).  The question asks what it *won't* be used for, and while all the other options are explicitly mentioned as potential uses, food production is presented as *one* use among others, not something the fund is specifically avoiding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Te kawe i te hangarau ki ngā whenua whanaketanga** (Transferring technology to developing countries) - The passage explicitly mentions supporting developing islands to grow on low-carbon paths *using* technology.
* **C: Whare whakatika waipuke** (Coastal defenses) - The passage states money *can* go to coastal defenses.
* **D: E whakaiti ana i ngā pānga o te whakamahana o te ao** (Reducing the impacts of global warming) - The entire fund is aimed at helping countries deal with the impacts of climate change.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga, he aha te mea e tumanako ana te UN ki te whakaora?","The correct answer is **A: Te moni, na roto i te tohatoha o te hangarau** (Funding, through the distribution of technology).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kei te tūmanako hoki te Kotahitanga o Ngā Iwi o te Ao ki te whakaū i tētahi pūtea hei tautoko i ngā whenua e pāngia ana e te mahana haere o te ao kia puta i ngā pānga."" (The United Nations also hopes to secure funding to support countries affected by climate change to cope with the impacts.)  It also mentions distributing technology to help islands grow food on smaller plots of land.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Māra** (Gardens) - While the passage *mentions* growing food on smaller plots (gardens), it's not what the UN is hoping to *secure* or *fund*.
* **C: E toe ana i ngā ngahere** (Remaining forests) - The passage discusses restoring forests, but the UN isn't trying to ""secure"" them, they are working to *restore* them.
* **D: Ngā tāngata e pāngia ana e te whakahaere wai rawakore** (People affected by poor water management) - Better water management is mentioned as something the funding *could* be used for, but not what the UN is trying to secure itself.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i whakahuahia e Albert Muchanga hei mea e hiahiatia ana kia whakaaetia?,"The correct answer is **D: Whakaaetanga utu (Tariff concessions)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Albert Muchanga said, ""Kāore anō mātou kia whakaae ki ngā ture o te ahunga mai me ngā tukunga tāke hoko tāwāhi..."" which translates to ""We have not yet agreed on the rules of origin and tariff concessions..."".  

This directly indicates that *tariff concessions* (whakaaetanga utu) are still needing agreement. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mēnā ka hono a Benin ki AfCTA (Whether Benin joins AfCTA):** The passage clearly states Benin *is* joining.
*   **B: Te rā ka taea e te tauhokohoko te tīmata (The date trade can begin):** Muchanga specifies a target date of 1 Hōngongoi, 2020.
*   **C: Ngā ture Origin (Rules of Origin):** The passage explicitly mentions these are *not* yet agreed upon (""Kāore anō mātou kia whakaae ki ngā ture o te ahunga mai..."").



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te take e tīmata ai te tauhokohoko i a Hōngongoi?","The correct answer is **A: Ko te rā tīmatanga o Hōngongoi tētahi wāhanga o ngā tikanga a Nigeria mō te uru atu ki te AfCFTA.**

Here's why:

The passage states: """"Kāore anō mātou kia whakaae ki ngā ture o te ahunga mai me ngā tukunga tāke hoko tāwāhi, engari ko te pou tarāwaho kei a tātou he rawaka kia tīmata tehokohoko hei te 1 o Hōngongoi, hei te tau 2020"""" - which translates to ""We have not yet agreed on the rules of origin and customs duties, but our position is to be ready to start trading by July 1, 2020.""  This indicates July 1st is a *target date* based on Nigeria's preparations, *despite* not having all agreements in place.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While there *are* issues with rules and regulations, the passage doesn't say this is *why* they chose July 1st. It says they're aiming for that date *despite* those issues.
* **C:** The AU Commission stated the position, but didn't *cause* the date.
* **D:** The passage explicitly states they haven't agreed on these things (""Kāore anō mātou kia whakaae..."").



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea i whakapae ai te Atlanta Journal-Constitution ki ngā apiha mātauranga?","The correct answer is **C: Kāore i te mahi i ngā raruraru ā-roto kua kitea**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...i whakapaetia i kitea ki roto i te kura ngā raru engari kāore i mahi i runga i aua kitenga."" This translates to ""...it was alleged that problems were found within the school but no action was taken on those findings."" This directly supports the claim that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution accused the education officials of *not acting on problems they were aware of*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te whakararuraru i te pūrongo Journal-Constitution** - The passage says the Journal-Constitution *published* a report, not that they were disrupted.
*   **B: Kāore e taea te whakahou i te mātauranga tāone** - While the passage mentions issues with test scores, it doesn't say the officials were accused of failing to improve city-wide education.
*   **D: Te whakaatu i nga tohu whakamatautau iti** - The passage states test scores *increased* suspiciously, not that they showed low scores.



"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i hoatu i roto i te wāhanga, he aha te mea kihai i whakahuatia i roto i te pūrongo o te Atlanta Journal-Constitution?","The correct answer is **D: Ngā huatau mō te whakahou i te mātauranga taone (Plans for reforming urban education)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage focuses on test score manipulation and a cover-up.** It details suspicious increases in test scores, a report revealing irregularities, and accusations of cheating. It doesn't mention any specific plans *for reforming* urban education generally.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: whakapai ake i te tapeke whakamātautau rerekē (improvement in different testing scores)** - The passage *explicitly* discusses improvements in test scores, but notes they were abnormally high and suspicious.
*   **B: He taunakitanga kua whakarerekētia ngā pepa whakamātautau (Recommendations that test papers were altered)** - The passage states the report showed evidence of altered test papers.
*   **C: Te Kaiwhakahaere ā Iwi o te Tau 2013 o te tau toa (2013 Superintendent of the Year award winner)** - The passage mentions the award was given in 2009 and the subsequent scandal.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha ngā mōhiohio e mōhiotia ana e whai ana i te poho?","The correct answer is **A: Te tatau whara whakamutunga** (The final death toll).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""E ai ki ētahi rīpoata ka whakatau i te nui o ngā mate ki te waru, ā, ko ngā rīpoata ōkawa e whakaae ana ki ngā wharanga tae atu ki te 30; ēengari kāore anō ngā tau otinga kia whakatau."" (According to some reports, the number of deaths is estimated at eight, and unconfirmed reports suggest figures as high as 30; but final figures have not yet been determined.)

This directly addresses what is *unknown* after the bombing - the conclusive death toll. The passage is actively stating the numbers are still being confirmed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ko ēhea whare i pakū tata ai nga pomu** (Which buildings were bombed nearby) - The passage says bombs exploded *near* government buildings, but doesn't specify *which* buildings.
* **C: Mehemea me whakapakū ētahi atu pomu** (Whether any more bombs will explode) - The passage doesn't discuss the possibility of further bombings.
* **D: Te tawhiti o te mate whai mana** (The range of authoritative deaths) -  This isn’t the question. The passage talks about *estimates* of death, not a defined “range of authoritative deaths.”



"
"Mai i tana taunga ki Manchester City i te tau 2017, e hia ngā tukinga i takaro ai a Ihu?","The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The passage states: ""Mai i taua wā, 53 ngā kēmu kua kitea te tangata nei o Brazil mā te karapu ki ia whakataetae..."" which translates to ""Since then, the Brazilian has appeared in 53 games for the club in all competitions...""

Therefore, he has *played* in 53 games. The number 24 refers to the number of goals he scored, not the number of games played."
Ko tēhea karapu i whiwhi ai a Ihu i te utu £27 miriona mo te hono?,"The correct answer is **A: Palmeiras**.

The text states ""Mai i te karapu Parihi a Palmeiras e kīia ana ko te utu ko te 27 miriona pauna"" which translates to ""From the Brazilian club called Palmeiras the fee was stated to be 27 million pounds.""  This clearly indicates Palmeiras received the £27 million fee.



"
Ko tēhea kōrero e pā ana ki ngā manuhiri o te whare noho kore he pono?,"The correct answer is **D: Ko te nuinga o nga manuhiri no te taone tapu.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ko te nuinga o ngā manuhiri mai i te hōtēra he kirirarau o te United Arab Emirates."" (Most of the guests from the hotel were citizens of the United Arab Emirates.) This directly contradicts the statement that most of the guests were from the holy city (Mecca).

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: I Mekaha nga manuhiri mo te noho manene** - This is true. The passage states people were staying at the lodging while visiting Mecca.
* **B: Ehara ētahi manuhiri i te tangata whenua o te rohe** - This is true. Guests came *to* Mecca, implying they weren't local.
* **C: I reira nga manuhiri mo te ahiahi o Hajj** - This is true. The passage mentions guests arrived during the evening of the Hajj pilgrimage.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā tauākī e whai ake nei e pono ana?","The correct answer is **C: I reira ngā manuhiri mō te pō o te haerenga Hajj**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""I noho ētahi tāngata hāereere ā-hāhi ki te whare i tae mai rātou ki te toro ki te tāone nui tapu i te ahiahi pō o te haerenga ā-hāhi hajj."" (Some pilgrims stayed at the building after arriving to visit the holy city on the evening of the pilgrimage hajj).  This directly supports the statement that guests were there for the Hajj pilgrimage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kaore he mate kino (There are no serious injuries/deaths):** The passage states ""Ko te tatauranga mate ko te 15 i te itinga iho"" (The death toll is at least 15) and anticipates it will rise. This is the *opposite* of no serious deaths.
* **B: Ko ngā manuhiri katoa nō United Arab Emirates (All the guests are from the United Arab Emirates):**  The passage says ""Ko te nuinga o ngā manuhiri mai i te hōtēra he kirirarau o te United Arab Emirates"" (Most of the guests at the hotel were citizens of the United Arab Emirates), meaning *most*, not *all*.
* **D: Ko te nuinga o nga manuhiri ko nga tangata whenua o Mecca (Most of the guests are locals of Mecca):** The passage specifically states they are *pilgrims* coming *to* Mecca, implying they are not from there.



"
"I runga anō i te whakawhitinga, he aha te mōhiohio mo te tutukitanga ehara i te rangirua?","The correct answer is **A: Te rahi o te tutukitanga (The size of the impact)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""E ngana tonu nei rātou ki te whakatau i pēhea te nui o te tūtukitanga me te āhuatanga ki te pānga hoki ki te ao.""  This translates to ""They are still trying to determine how big the impact was and what the effects are on the world.""

This directly indicates scientists are trying to figure out the *size* of the impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Te tauwāhi o te tutukitanga (The location of the impact):** The text mentions it hit 491 miles *above* Earth, not a specific location *on* Earth.
* **C: Te pānga o te tūtuki ki te Whenua (The impact of the impact on the Earth):** While the text mentions effects on the world, it's *trying to determine* the impact, not stating what it is.
* **D: Te tauwāhi otaota (The origin of the impact):** The text doesn't discuss where the asteroid *came from*, only that it impacted.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha tonu te tikanga kia whakatauria e pā ana ki te tutukitanga?","The correct answer is **D: Te tauine tika o te hinga** (The exact location of the impact).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""E ngana tonu nei rātou ki te whakatau i pēhea te nui o te tūtukitanga me te āhuatanga ki te pānga hoki ki te ao."" This translates to ""They are still trying to determine how big the impact was and its nature and how it will affect the world.""  

This directly refers to determining the *exact* nature and location (size and characteristics) of the impact – essentially, *where* it hit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ko wai e whakahaere i te aroturuki otaota** (Who is managing the debris tracking) - While mentioned (US Strategic Command), it's not what scientists are trying to *determine*.
*   **B: He pēhea te tere o ngā amiorangi i te wā o te tukinga** (How fast were the meteors at the time of impact) - The passage *states* the speed, they aren't trying to figure it out.
*   **C: Me pēhea te tiritahi i ngā hua tātari** (How to mitigate the consequences) -  The passage mentions the impact *will* affect the world, but it focuses on understanding the impact *first* before mitigation.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea wāhi i puritia e Batten i runga i te rārangi o ngā Kaiāwhina Taunaki rawa?","The correct answer is **C: 190th**.

The passage states: ""I noho 190 a Batten ki te rārangi 400 Richest Americans o te tau 2008..."" which translates to ""Batten ranked 190 on the 2008 list of 400 Richest Americans..."""
Ko tēhea o ēnei i whai ake nei i hoatu e Batten he koha?,"The correct answer is **B: Te Whare Wānanga o Virginia**.

The passage states that Batten graduated from and was a major benefactor to the University of Virginia. This directly indicates he gave gifts to that institution. The other options are either too broad (C), or not mentioned in the text (A & D).



"
He aha te mea kāore i te wāhanga o te pire i hainatia e te Kawana a Arnold Schwarzenegger?,"The correct answer is **C: He aukati i te hoko, i te riihi rānei o ngā kēmu ataata tutu ki ngā tamariki iti i waho o California**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the bill pertains to sales *within* California (""ki te takiwā o Kariwhōnia""). It doesn't mention any restrictions on sales *outside* of California.  The bill focuses on regulating sales *to* minors within the state, not controlling what happens elsewhere.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage states the bill requires all games sold in California to be rated ""18"" and penalizes selling to children. This *is* a restriction on selling violent games to children.
*   **B:** The passage clearly states a $1,000 fine per violation (""ka hāmenetia koe mō te $1,000 mo ia tūkinotanga"").
*   **D:** Requiring ratings for mature games is implied by the ""18"" rating requirement.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko wai i hapa i nga mea e kōrerotia ana?","The correct answer is **C: Miller**.

Here's why:

The passage states Miller said, ""...Mike had a slow mouth in times of deliberation... as I corrected myself, I didn't hear him."" This directly implies Miller believes *they* made a mistake by not hearing Mike during deliberation, thus taking responsibility for the miscommunication or issue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā tamariki a Duvall (Duvall's children):** The passage mentions Duvall leaving thoughts with his children, but doesn't attribute the error to them.
*   **B: Mike:** Miller is saying *they* didn't hear Mike, not that Mike did something wrong.
*   **D: Duvall:** Duvall is simply mentioned as having left a thought; the issue is with Miller's hearing/understanding.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e pono ana ki te wheako o Miller i te whakarongo?","The correct answer is **B: Kaore a ia i aro atu i a ia e takatū ana** (He didn't pay attention to him while he was standing).

Here's why:

The passage directly states Miller said, ""...kāore au i rongo i a ia"" (""I didn't hear him""). This means he wasn't paying attention.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I miharo a Duvall ki a Miller i te wā o te whakarongo** (Duvall was surprised by Miller during the hearing) - The passage doesn't mention Duvall's reaction to Miller *during* the hearing, only Duvall having thoughts about Miller.
* **C: He maha ngā kōrero a ngā tamariki e rua a Duvall i te wā o te whakarongo** (The two children of Duvall said a lot during the hearing) - The passage states the children were *left with* a thought, not that they spoke a lot.
* **D: I te āta titiro atu a ia ki te pūrākau a Duvall** (He looked closely at Duvall's story) - This is not stated in the passage.



"
Nā wai i huatau kia mahia ngā arotakenga ki te 'Ture Hau Mā'?,"The correct answer is **D: Stephen Harper**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kua whakaae te Pirimia a Stephen Harper ki te tuku i te """"Clean Air Act"""" o te kāwanatanga ki tētahi komiti pāti-katoa hei arotake..."" which translates to ""Prime Minister Stephen Harper has agreed to send the government's """"Clean Air Act"""" to a all-party committee for review...""

Therefore, Stephen Harper is the one who initiated the review of the 'Clean Air Act'.



"
"""Ko wai i whakakāhore i te whakamahinga o te """"Ture Hau Mā"""" hei mahi pōti tōmua?""","The correct answer is **B: He Pirimia**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Kua whakaae te Pirimia a Stephen Harper ki te tuku i te """"Clean Air Act"""" o te kāwanatanga ki tētahi komiti pāti-katoa hei arotake..."" (Prime Minister Stephen Harper agreed to send the ""Clean Air Act"" to a all-party committee for review). This clearly indicates the Prime Minister is the one who decided to delay/review the Act, effectively putting a hold on using it as immediate political leverage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te mana o te kāwanatanga o te kāwanatanga (The authority of the government authority):** While the government is involved, the *decision* specifically comes from the Prime Minister.
*   **C: He kaiārahi NDP (An NDP leader):** Jack Layton requested a review but didn't have the power to halt the Act himself.
*   **D: He MP a te hau (A hau MP):** MPs might voice concerns, but they don't have the authority to unilaterally postpone legislation.



"
He aha te āhua o te waikawa cyanuric me te melamine i a rātau e mahi tahi ana i roto i te waikura ngeru?,"The correct answer is **C: tioata**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nā ngā kai rangahau o te whare wānanga te kī, ka hohe ngā pūhui e rua tētahi ki tētahi kia hanga **tioata** e kati pea ai i te mahinga o te whatumanawa.""  (The university researchers say the two compounds combine to form **crystals** that may block kidney function.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tākihi** - While crystals *are* a type of solid, the passage specifically names them ""tioata"" in this context.
*   **B: Kai kararehe** - This means ""animal feed"" and is what caused the problem, but not what the two chemicals *become* when they interact.
*   **D: Tārua pōkākā** - This refers to the infrared spectroscopy method used to *detect* the crystals, not the crystals themselves.



"
He aha ngā mea i kitea e ngā kairangahau mā te pūāhua infrared?,"The correct answer is **B: hanganga Crystal i roto i te mimi kararehe** (crystal structures in animal urine).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I kite ngā kairangahau i te hanganga mai o ngā tioata ki te mimi ngeru i te tāpiritangao te melamine me te cyanuric acid. Ko te hanganga o ēnei tioata e hāngai ana ki ērā ka kitea ki te mimi o ngā mōkai e pāngia ana ina ka whakatairitea mā te mātaitanga rārangi aho hihi pōkākā (infrared spectroscopy, FTIR).""

This translates to: ""The researchers observed the formation of crystals in the urine when melamine and cyanuric acid were added. The structure of these crystals is similar to those found in the urine of affected animals when analyzed using infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mahi tākihi** (Research work) - This is too general. The passage details *what* the research found, not just that research was done.
*   **C: Ngā mōkai i pāngia** (Affected animals) - While the passage talks about affected animals, FTIR was used to analyze *something* from them – the crystals in their urine.
*   **D: Kai kararehe kua whakaritea** (Contaminated animal feed) - The feed is the *source* of the problem, but FTIR was not directly used to analyze the feed in this context. It was used to analyze the urine.



"
"""Ko wai e kōrero ana ki a Luna ko te """"Queen of Extreme""""?""","The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The text states: ""Nā Tommy Dreamer i kī """"Ko Luna te Queen of Extreme tuatahi."""" "" which translates to ""Tommy Dreamer said """"Luna was the first Queen of Extreme."""""".

Therefore, Tommy Dreamer is the one referring to Luna as the ""Queen of Extreme"".



"
"""Ko wai e kōrero ana ki a Luna he """"hē""""?""","The correct answer is **B: Dustin Runnels**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""I kōrerotia pēnei e Dustin """"Goldust"""" Runnels """"I pēnei rawa te whanokē o Luna i ahau nei...i nui ake rānei pea...aroha nui ki a ia, ka mokemoke ki a ia...ko te tūmanako kei tētahi wāhi pai ake ia."""""".  This translates to Dustin Runnels saying he felt a connection with Luna, and misses her - essentially expressing grief and loss.  ""He"" in the question refers to feeling grief.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ana kaiwhaiwhai (her fans):** The text doesn't mention fans expressing grief.
*   **C: Ngā kaihoko kāwanatanga (government investigators):** They found ""black box"" recordings, they didn't express grief.
*   **D: Tommy Dreamer:** He praises Luna, but doesn’t express a feeling of loss or grief.



"
He aha kāore i pā ki te atekōkiri i roto i te hinga?,"The correct answer is **B: Kaore i whara tetahi o nga tangata o roto o te kainga** (No one inside the house was injured).

Here's why:

* **The question asks what *wasn't* affected by the crash.** The passage states ""kāore tētahi i whara"" (no one was injured) regarding the people *inside the house*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I pāngia e ia nga mate o te māhunga** (He suffered head injuries) - This *was* an effect of the crash.
* **C: I whakawhitia ia i tētahi hōhipera i Cambridge ki tētahi i Great Yarmouth** (He was transferred from a hospital in Cambridge to one in Great Yarmouth) - This is incorrect, he was transferred *to* Cambridge (Addenbrooke's) *from* Great Yarmouth.
* **D: Na nga ratonga ohorere a ia i āwhina ki te tango i a ia i tana waka** (Emergency services helped remove him from his car) - This *was* a consequence of the crash.



"
He aha te mea kāore i tino kitea i roto i te tākaro a Awherika ki te Tonga i te wā o te whakataetae whutupaoro?,"The correct answer is **C: He mahinga whakapipi i te tīmatanga o te whakataetae** (a shaky start to the competition).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He tino taumaha te āhua i te kēmu ki ō rātou tuakana nō te tonga, heoi anō i piki haere a Āwherika ki te Tonga i te ahunga whakamua o te taiwhanga.""  This translates to ""The game felt heavy against their older southern counterparts, but South Africa rose in the progress of the tournament.""  This indicates they *didn't* start strong; they had a difficult beginning before improving.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mahi a te tīma pōrearea** (Aggressive team play) - The passage mentions good defense and skillful handling, implying a strong, potentially aggressive play style.
* **B: Āheinga whakahaere pōro** (Ball handling ability) - The passage specifically states ""ngā pukenga pai ki te rāwekeweke i te pōro"" (good skills in handling the ball).
* **D: pūkenga tohutohu** (Coaching skills) - The passage doesn’t discuss coaching skills at all.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i te tīmatanga o te kēmu a Āwherika ki te Tonga ki te whakapai ake?","The correct answer is **A: Neke atu i te 10:00 a**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""I tīmata ngā kēmu i te 10:00 i te ata..."" (The games started at 10:00 am...).  It then goes on to describe how South Africa *performed* after the game started, but the starting time is the answer to when they began to play/improve (by playing the game!).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I muri i te whakamau i te parenga** (After establishing dominance) - The text doesn't mention establishing dominance as a starting point for improvement. It *results* from their good play.
* **C: I muri i te ngarotanga ki Zambia** (After losing to Zambia) - The text mentions a win against Tanzania, not a loss to Zambia.
* **D: I te haerenga o te whakataetae** (During the competition) -  This is too general. The question asks about the *beginning* of their improvement *within* this specific game.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei kaore e whakaata tika ana i te āhua o te mahi o Haina?","The correct answer is **A: Mai i te mahi whakahōu, kua nui haere te āhua o te whakahaerenga o Haina mai i te mahi whakahōu.**

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on economic reform and growth.** It explicitly states reforms began under Deng Xiaoping and details *economic* achievements (GDP growth, becoming a major exporter like cars). It doesn't mention any changes to the *style of governance* (how China is run politically).  The statement in A makes a claim about governance which isn't supported by the text.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

* **B: He mākete nui ake tā Haina mō te kaweake motokā i te Hononga o Amerika** - The passage directly states ""i kawe ake ngā motuka mai i Haina ki Tiamana, ka hipa i Amerika, ko ia te mākete nui rawa."" (cars were exported from China to Germany, then surpassed America, the largest market).
* **C: Ka nui ake pea te GDP o Haina i te United States** -  The passage states ""Ka nui ake pea te GDP o Haina, i tā Ngā Whenua Tōpū o Amerika hei roto tonu i ngā tekau tau e rua."" (China's GDP will likely surpass the United States within the next two decades).
* **D: Kāore anō a Haina kia kaweake i ētahi atu motokā i Tiamana** - The passage indicates China *did* export cars to Germany (""i kawe ake ngā motuka mai i Haina ki Tiamana""). The phrasing ""Kāore anō"" (has not yet) is incorrect based on the text.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ina hipa atu te GDP o Haina i Te Hononga o Amerika?","The correct answer is **A: Whai muri i ētahi atu huringa ohaoha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka nui ake pea te GDP o Haina, i tā Ngā Whenua Tōpū o Amerika hei roto tonu i ngā tekau tau e rua."" This translates to ""China's GDP will likely surpass that of the United States within the next twelve years.""  The passage doesn't give a specific timeframe *immediately* after the economic reforms, but frames it as happening *over* a period of time – ""within the next twelve years"" implies after further economic changes and growth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: I roto i te rua tau** - The passage indicates a much longer timeframe (twelve years).
*   **C: Ina noho te whenua i raro i te ārahi hou** - While Deng Xiaoping's leadership started the reforms, the surpassing of the US GDP is projected for the future, not immediately under his leadership.
*   **D: I roto i te toru tau** - Again, the passage specifically states *twelve* years, not three.



"
He aha te whakaaro a Hu kia mahia e nga whenua whanaketanga?,"The correct answer is **D: Kei te karo i ngā ara tawhito o te pokenga** (Avoid the old ways of poverty).

Here's why:

The text states: """"kia āraia te huarahi o mua o te parakino i te tuatahi, me te whakapai i muri iho ."""" which translates to """"to avoid the old path of poverty first, and then improve."""" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Whakaae i ngā herenga e akiaki ana i tō rātou taumata whanaketanga** (Accept commitments that promote their development level) - While development is implied, the text specifically focuses on *avoiding* past mistakes, not just accepting commitments.
*   **B: Arotahi ki te huaputa ohaoha** (Focus on economic output) - Hu talks about GDP targets, but his advice to developing nations is about *how* they develop, not simply focusing on output.
*   **C: Haere ki tua atu i ō rātou kawenga o nāianei** (Go beyond their current obligations) - The text explicitly states the opposite: """"me kaua rātou e tonoa kia hiki i ngā kawenga kei tua atu i tā rātou wā whakawhanaketanga, haepapa, āheinga hoki."""""" (""they should not be asked to take on obligations beyond their stage of development, capabilities, and capacity."")



"
He aha kāore i kōrerotia e Hu?,"The correct answer is **A: Te pūtake mo nga tapahi** (The reason for the cuts).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kāore ia i whakarite i ētahi nama mō ngā tapatapahi, e kī ana ka whakaritea i runga i te tāputa o te ohaoha o Haina."" (He did not specify any numbers for the cuts, saying they would be determined based on the Chinese economy.) This directly means he *didn't mention the reason* behind the cuts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He tohutohu ki ngā whenua whanaketanga mō te poke** (Instruction to developing countries about debt) - The passage *does* contain advice to developing nations (""kia āraia te huarahi o mua o te parakino i te tuatahi, me te whakapai i muri iho"").
* **C: He rā e tūmanako ana kia tapahia te kohu waro e** (A date when the carbon emissions are expected to be cut) - The passage states a goal ""i mua i te tau 2020 mai i te taumata o te tau 2005"" (before 2020 from the 2005 level) – a timeframe, not just a date.
* **D: He whika mo te mutunga o te hara waro** (A figure for the end of carbon emissions) - While the passage doesn't give a *specific* number, it does state a goal relating to a reduction (""kia haukoti i te putanga waro hāora-rua"").



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e kī ana a Veerman kāore te āhuatanga i te pai?,"The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

Here's why:

The passage states Richard Veerman (from Medecines Sans Frontieres) says: """"E anga atu ana a Angola ki te horapatanga kino rawa, ā, e kino rawa tonu ana ki Angola"""" which translates to ""Angola is heading towards a severe crisis, and it is very bad for Angola."" 

He is directly stating the situation in Angola is bad.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Medecines Sans Frontieres:** Veerman *works for* Medecines Sans Frontieres, but he isn't saying *they* are doing poorly. He's commenting on Angola.
*   **C: Mangola:** Mangola is mentioned as part of the group responding, not as being in a bad situation.
*   **D: Te Whakahaere Hauora Ao (World Health Organisation):**  Like Medecines Sans Frontieres, they are responding to the situation, not *being* the subject of the bad situation.



"
"Nā te whakawakanga, ko wai ka tango i te tūranga kāwanatanga a Huhne?","The correct answer is **C: Lamb**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ka tū a Huhne me Pryce ki mua i te aroaro o te kōti o Westminster...ka eke atu hoki a **Norman Lamb MP ki te whakakapi i te tūranga minita mō ngā mahi Pakihi.**"" 

This directly translates to Norman Lamb MP will replace Huhne's ministerial position for Business.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Davey** - Davey replaced Huhne in the smaller committee, not his government position.
*   **B: Starmer** - Starmer is a QC commenting on the situation, not taking a position.
*   **D: Pryce** - Pryce is also facing court alongside Huhne, not taking his position.



"
Ko wai ka riro i a ia te tūranga Minita Pakihi i muri i te whakawakanga?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ka tū a Huhne me Pryce ki mua i te aroaro o te kōti o Westminster, hei te 16 o Pēpuere. Tōna tikanga ka eke atu hoki a **Norman Lamb MP** ki te whakakapi i te tūranga minita mō ngā mahi Pakihi."" 

This directly translates to: ""Huhne and Pryce will appear before the Westminster court on February 16th. This means **Norman Lamb MP** will take over the position of Minister for Business.""



"
He aha te mea e akiaki ana nga kaiwhakaari i te hunga whakarongo ki te mahi i roto i te opera a Camille Saint-Saens?,"The correct answer is **C: Hono ki a rātou i runga i te wāhanga mō te mahinga.**

Here's why:

The passage states the actors are ""whakahau nei rātou i te minenga kia whai mai hoki"" – which translates to ""inviting the audience to join them.""  The context is they are miming smoking on stage, suggesting they are inviting the audience to partake *with them* in the activity.  ""Hono ki a rātou i runga i te wāhanga mō te mahinga"" best captures this idea of joining in.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Partake i te whakamahinga o Cannabis:** While the miming suggests cannabis use, the invitation is to *join them* in the act, not just to use cannabis generally.
*   **B: Haere ki Tiapanī:** Japan is mentioned as something the artist loves, but there's no invitation to travel there.
*   **D: Tukua kia whakahaeretia tō rātou ora e te mea e aroha ana rātou:** This is a broad interpretation of being guided by passion, but doesn't directly relate to the actors' action of inviting the audience to participate.



"
Ko wai te nuinga o nga kauruki i te wā o te opera?,"The correct answer is **A: Te rehetoi** (The audience).

Here's why:

The passage states the performers were ""commanding the audience to follow suit"" while throwing peach pits. This directly indicates the audience was the target of the command and therefore the majority receiving the peach pits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Te hunga Wīwī** (The Viennese people) - The passage doesn't indicate they were being pelted with peach pits.
*   **C: Nga kaiwhakatū** (The performers) - They are *throwing* the peach pits, not receiving them.
*   **D: Camille Saint-Saens** (Camille Saint-Saens) - He composed the opera, he isn't involved in the peach pit throwing.



"
"""He aha tētahi atu ingoa mo te """"haere mokowā"""" i mahia e Rua?""","The correct answer is **B: Whakataetae Mokowā (Space Race)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...nāna i ārahi te wāhanga Soviet o te haerenga Apollo-Soyuz i reira i tohua ai kua oti te Space Race."" (He led the Soviet part of the Apollo-Soyuz mission where the Space Race was declared over.)

The ""haere mokowā"" (Space Race) is what the Apollo-Soyuz mission *ended*.  The passage directly links Leonov to the conclusion of the Space Race.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Te mahi a Aporo-Soyuz (The Apollo-Soyuz mission):** This is a mission Leonov participated in, but not *another name* for the Space Race.
* **C: Hohenga ā-roto (Internal fusion):** This is unrelated to the text.
* **D: Cosmonaut Kāo. 11 (Cosmonaut No. 11):** This is a title/number associated with Leonov, not a name for the Space Race.



"
Na Ruaov i ārahi te wāhi o Rōpūria o tēhea mahi?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

The passage states: ""Tekau tau ki muri, nāna i ārahi te wāhanga Soviet o te haerenga Apollo-Soyuz i reira i tohua ai kua oti te Space Race.""  This directly translates to ""Ten years later, he led the Soviet part of the Apollo-Soyuz journey where it was declared the Space Race was over.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te Whakataetae Mokowā (The Space Race)** - While the Apollo-Soyuz mission *ended* the Space Race, Leonov didn't lead the entire race, just the Soviet portion of this specific mission.
*   **C: Cosmonaut Kāo. 11 (Cosmonaut No. 11)** - This is a title Leonov *had*, not a mission he led.
*   **D: EVA (Extravehicular Activity)** - Leonov was the first to perform an EVA, but he didn't *lead* that activity in the sense the question asks. He *was* the participant.



"
Ko wai i whara i te hinga?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibson**.

The text states: ""i kawea a Gibson ki tētahi hōhipera engari kāore i roa ka mate ia"" - ""Gibson was taken to a hospital but died shortly after."" This directly indicates Gibson was the one harmed in the accident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He kaimahi Garage (A garage worker):** The garage worker witnessed the event but wasn't *whara* (injured).
* **C: Tamariki (Children):** The text says the children were frightened (""i te hāparangi, i te tangi rātou"") but doesn't state they were injured.
* **D: He atekōkiri taraka (A truck driver):** The text specifically states ""Kāore i whara te kaitaraiwa taraka"" - ""The truck driver was not injured.""



"
He aha i pā ki te iwi i roto i te aituā?,"The correct answer is **A: I mate rāua tahi** (They both died).

Here's why:

* The text states ""i kawea a Gibson ki tētahi hōhipera engari kāore i roa ka mate ia"" (Gibson was taken to a hospital but died soon after).
* It also implies another person died in the accident (""i te pānga o te aituā"" - the impact of the accident).  The description of children crying and running away strongly suggests a fatal incident involving more than just Gibson.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kotahi i whara, kotahi i mate** (One was injured, one died) - The driver was *not* injured (""Kāore i whara te kaitaraiwa taraka"").
* **C: I te hākere rātau, i te tangi** (They ran, they cried) - While the children ran and cried, this doesn't describe *what happened to the people involved* in the accident. It describes the reaction *to* the accident.
* **D: I pāngia e rāua nga whara** (They were affected by injuries) -  This is too vague and doesn't reflect the fact that at least one person died.



"
I tūmanako nga kaipūtaiao e mahi ana i te hōtaka kia kite i ngā pānga i puta mai i tēhea o ēnei?,"The correct answer is **D: Take pōuri**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""E mea ana tēnei ariā ko te pōuriuri mei te ao tukupū"" which translates to ""This aria is about the darkness from the primordial world.""  And earlier, it mentions ""ko te mea pouri ka pā e ētahi atu mea pouri i te āhuatanga ōrite ki te mea noa nei"" - ""the darkness that is struck by other darknesses with a similar nature to the usual one."" 

The scientists were studying something related to darkness, and the overall tone of the passage focuses on this concept.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Take auau (waves):** While the passage mentions the moon and tides (""tā te marama ki te ao, me tāna whakarite i ngā tai""), the primary focus isn't on waves themselves, but on the influence of the celestial bodies.
*   **B: Ngā tōpana Tidal (Tidal forces):** Though connected to the moon and tides, the core subject matter isn't just tidal forces, but the darkness and its interaction with the Sagittarius constellation.
*   **C: Ngā korakora iti (small particles):** This is not mentioned in the passage at all.



"
Ko tehea o ngā mea e whai ake nei i kitea e ngā kaipūtaiao?,"The correct answer is **C: Te Whenua me te Marama (Earth and the Moon)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I taea e ngā kaiputaiao te whakatau, ko te mea pouri ka pā e ētahi atu mea pouri i te āhuatanga ōrite ki te mea noa nei.""  This translates to ""Scientists have determined that the darkness impacted by other darknesses has a similar characteristic to that of the Earth and the Moon."" 

The passage is comparing the darkness caused by the celestial event to the natural darkness created by the Earth and Moon's relationship (eclipses, nighttime).  Therefore, the scientists discovered a similarity between the event and Earth and the Moon.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te Ara Miraka me te Marama (Milky Way and the Moon):** The Milky Way isn't directly mentioned as being a point of comparison in the text.
*   **B: Te Whenua me te ikarangi Sagittarius (Earth and Sagittarius):** While Sagittarius is part of the overall context, the comparison isn't *to* Sagittarius itself, but to the phenomenon of darkness generally.
*   **D: Te ikarangi Sagittarius me te Ara Miraka (Sagittarius and the Milky Way):** Similar to option A, the Milky Way isn't a key comparison point.



"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, he aha te mea e whakahētia ana e nga tohutohu?","The correct answer is **C: Ko wai e whakawhiwhia ana ki ngā kirimana whakahoutanga** (Who is being awarded the reconstruction contracts).

Here's why:

The passage directly states: ""...kua aro atu ngā kōrero whakahē huhua o te mahi hanga anō ki te tuku i ngā kirimana hanga anō ki te hunga e whakaarohia ana he hoa nō roto o Washington.""  This translates to: ""...the false allegations of reconstruction work have focused on awarding reconstruction contracts to those considered insiders in Washington.""

The passage is criticizing *who* received the contracts, implying favoritism and corruption.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te hokohoko āwhina (Profiteering):** While profiteering is *implied* by the accusation of ""short fingers"" and a ""Bush's New Orleans Deal"", the direct focus isn't on the act of making a profit, but *who* is making the profit.
*   **B: Te kore mahi hanga hou (Lack of reconstruction work):** The passage assumes reconstruction work *is* happening, but that it's being done unfairly.
*   **D: Te whakapau hanga anō (Reconstruction spending):**  The passage doesn't question *how much* money is being spent, but *where* it's going.



"
Ko wai e whakahe ana i ngā kirimana hanga anō mō ngā mahi āwhina o Hurricane Katrina?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngā insider o Washington**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...arā he whakatoi te tapa a ētahi ringa poto i tērā hei """"Bush's New Orleans Deal."""" Kua aro atu ngā kōrero whakahē huhua o te mahi hanga anō ki te tuku i ngā kirimana hanga anō ki te hunga e whakaarohia ana he hoa nō roto o Washington.""

This translates to: ""...that the approach of some short-fingered people was a 'Bush's New Orleans Deal.'  False allegations of reconstruction work have focused on awarding reconstruction contracts to those considered Washington insiders.""

Therefore, the passage directly accuses ""Washington insiders"" of improperly receiving reconstruction contracts.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ka kitea ngā rama mai i te waka ātea Stardust i te tuatahi?","The correct answer is **B: California ki te Raki** (Northern California).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kei te tāria tāna whakaatu i ngā tūrama mīharo ki te hunga ki Northern California, ki Oregon, ki Nevada, ki Utah.""  This translates to ""...it is displaying its wonderful lights to those in Northern California, Oregon, Nevada, and Utah.""

Therefore, Northern California is the first location mentioned where the lights were seen. The other states were also able to see the lights, but Northern California was the initial viewing point.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ka tautuhia e te waka ātea he pūkete mo tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei?","The correct answer is **C: Hoki ana ki Te Whenua i te tino tere** (Returning to Earth at the fastest speed).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""**Ka whakaritea e te Stardust te rikoata mō te waka aorangi tere rawa kia hoki mai ki te Ao nei**"" - ""Stardust is set to break the record for the fastest spacecraft to return to Earth.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: tīramaramatia te awhe whānui rawa o te Rangi** (Illuminating the widest range of the Sky) - While the craft *is* visible across a wide area, the main goal isn't illumination, it's speed of return.
* **B: E kitea ana i te nuinga o nga pa** (Seen in most places) - The passage mentions visibility in several states, but this is a consequence of its trajectory, not its primary objective.
* **D: Ko te haere mai i San Francisco ki Los Angeles te tere rawa** (Traveling from San Francisco to Los Angeles is the fastest) - This is an example *demonstrating* the speed, not the record it's trying to break. The record is for the return to Earth.



"
He pēhea te āhua o Tākuta E pā ana a Malar Balasubramanian ki a Saroja Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **C: Whaea** (Mother).

The text states: ""...he tīraha ana, e ai ki ētahi rangatira ki Ohio... i kitea a Takuta Malar Balasubramanian... ki tōna māmā e tīraha ana..."" which translates to ""...was fatally shot, according to authorities in Ohio... Dr. Malar Balasubramanian... found his mother shot..."" 

Therefore, Saroja Balasubramanian is Dr. Malar Balasubramanian's mother.



"
I hea te tinana o Sara Parasubramanian i kitea?,"The correct answer is **C: I roto i te pūtake o te motokā**. 

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ki reira rātou kite ai i te tinana o Saroja Balasubramanian, 53, kua uhia ki ngā paraikete toto.""  This translates to ""There they found the body of Saroja Balasubramanian, 53, stabbed with blood.""  And previously, it mentions the body was found near her son’s Oldsmobile Intrigue, which is a car. Therefore, the body was found *inside* the car.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I cincinnati** - While Blue Ash, Ohio is near Cincinnati, the text specifies *where* in relation to Cincinnati the body was found (near the car).
*   **B: I te taha o te huarahi** - The text states he was found next to the car, but not specifically *on* the road.
*   **D: I Pittsburgh** - Pittsburgh is where the doctor worked, not where the body was found.



"
He aha i whiwhia e eBay?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

Here's why:

The passage states that eBay is expected to separate its assets, and there's hope that Skype will have a strong position in certain areas (China, Eastern Europe, Brazil). This implies eBay *owns* Skype, or at least *owned* it and is now separating from it.  The passage doesn't mention Microsoft, Apple, or Zoom in relation to eBay's gains or asset separation.



"
He aha te mea e whai ana a eBay ki te whakatutuki i te hoko?,"The correct answer is **B: Whakaroha ki ngā rohe hōu (Expand into new regions)**.

Here's why:

The passage states eBay hopes to ""establish a strong foothold"" for Skype in areas like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil. This directly indicates an intention to expand into new regions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Whakatōpūtia tana moni hua (Free up its capital)** - While dividing assets *could* free up capital, the passage focuses on *where* they hope Skype will succeed, not simply generating capital.
*   **C: Whakarewatia tōna kōtaha (Increase its efficiency)** - The passage doesn't mention improving efficiency.
*   **D: Kia makona ona kaipupuri hea (Satisfy its shareholders)** - While a positive outcome of expansion, the passage doesn't directly state this is the *goal* of the sale/division.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, kaore rātau i tauwhiti ki nga hoa i noho i roto i te whawhai i muri i te whārangi?","The correct answer is **C: Ngā Āpiha** (The Officers).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ā tata nei, ka kōkiritia te iāri e ngā āpiha he kaka whawhai ō rātou..."" This translates to ""Shortly after, the yard was stormed by the officers as a fighting area...""  This directly implies the officers were involved in the conflict *within* the yard during the riot.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: kaiwhakarite** (Negotiators) - The passage says they *tried* to fix the situation, but weren't successful and weren't directly involved in the fighting.
*   **B: Ngā kaimahi whakaora ahi** (Fire rescue workers) - They arrived *after* the fire started, to extinguish it.
*   **D: Kaimahi hōhipera** (Hospital staff) - They were mentioned initially as the place the inmates were taken, but not involved in the riot itself.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ka hoki whakamuri nga herehere i te whakararuraru?,"The correct answer is **D: He ahi** (A fire).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ahakoa te wā, i tīneia te ahi i mua i te 11:35 pm e ngā kairanga kaitiaki ahi."" (Despite the time, the fire was extinguished before 11:35 pm by the fire guards.)  The fire was a direct consequence of the riot and the disturbance caused by the inmates. It's the event that *resulted* from their actions, meaning they would have to ""go back"" from the fire to the initial riot.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā whakaritenga momoho (Arrangements made):** Arrangements are attempts to *fix* the situation, not something the inmates would go back from causing.
*   **B: hau roimata (tears):**  Tears are a reaction *to* the disturbance, not the disturbance itself.
*   **C: Ko nga hoa mauhere i taotū (Inmate friends standing):** This isn't mentioned as a consequence or something inmates would revert from.



"
"Ki te whakaaro o Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, he aha te mea e tika ana kia whakaorangia te whenua o Iran?","The correct answer is **D: He whakamauru ki te hinu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nā te kaiārahi ariki o te whenua, a Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, i whakaatu i te whirinakitanga ki te hinu hei """"tētahi tārore"""" i ahu mai i mua i te whananga Ihirama a Irāna i te tau 1979, ā, me whakawātea te whenua i a ia anō i taua tārore.""

This translates to: ""The country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, expressed the view of oil as """"a curse"""" that originated before the Iranian revolution of 1979, and the country must free itself from that curse.""

Therefore, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei believes Iran needs to be freed *from* its reliance on oil - essentially, to move away from it.  ""He whakamauru ki te hinu"" (dependence on oil) is the thing he wants to escape.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā rāhuitanga pūtea (Financial sanctions):** While mentioned in the passage, these are a *cause* of Iran's issues, not what Khamenei believes will save the country.
*   **B: Te hurihanga ā-Rangi (Climate change):** This isn't discussed in the text.
*   **C: Moni whiwhinga ā-whenua (National income):** While oil contributes to Iran's income, Khamenei views it negatively, not as a solution."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nāna i whakaae ki nga pānga o te mana o te rangatiratanga o Ārepa?","The correct answer is **D: Te Uniana o Ūropi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kei roto i ērā ko ngā here ā-pūtea me te peitanga o te kawenga o te hinu urutapu e **Te Ūniana o Ūropi**, ā, ko tēnā tonu hoki te 80% o te whiwhinga pūtea mai i tāwāhi ka riro i a Irāna.""  (Among these are the financial sanctions and the embargo of crude oil by **the European Union**, and this also means 80% of Iran's foreign exchange earnings are lost.)

This directly indicates that the European Union imposed sanctions that had an impact on Iran's oil revenues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā pūtake matua (The main sources):** This is too general. The passage mentions sources of funding, but doesn't say they *agreed* to the effects of sanctions.
*   **B: OPEC:** OPEC reported a decrease in oil exports, but didn't *impose* sanctions.
*   **C: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei:** He spoke *about* oil as a ""curse"", but didn't agree to the effects of sanctions imposed by others.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i te wāhanga o te tukanga pōti o Wīwī?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā pouaka pōti pūataata (Sealed ballot boxes)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that from 1988, ballot boxes *must be visible* to voters and observers, ensuring they are empty at the start of voting and that no boxes are added except those of verified voters. This contradicts the idea of sealed ballot boxes.

Let's look at why the other options *are* part of the process:

*   **B: Ngā māngai i tukuna e ngā kaitono (Observers appointed by candidates):** The passage states candidates can send representatives to observe each stage of the process.
*   **C: Waitohu ana i tētahi rārangi pōti (Signing a voter list):** The process described involves verifying the voter's identity before they receive a ballot. This implies a list to check against.
*   **D: Ngā pōti i kautetia e ngā māngai kaitono (Ballots handled by candidate representatives):** While not directly stated, the observers' presence during the counting process suggests they would be involved in handling ballots.



"
Kei whea ngā kaipōti e tohu ana i tō rātou kaitono i whiriwhiri?,"The correct answer is **B: I runga i tētahi rau pepa tā tōmua** (On a pre-printed paper slip).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ka whakatakoto i tētahi whārangi pepa kua tāngia i mua e tohu ana i te kaitono e kōwhiritia ana ki tētahi kōpaki."" This translates to ""...and places a pre-printed paper slip indicating the selected candidate into a ballot box.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I runga i tētahi rārangi pōti** (On a ballot list) - The text doesn't mention a list.
*   **C: Kei runga i tētahi pūhera** (On a folder) - The folder is where the slip *goes*, not where the vote is marked.
*   **D: I runga i tētahi mīhini i roto i tētahi wāhi tihokahoka** (On a machine in a secluded place) - The text describes a very public and transparent process, not a secluded one with a machine.



"
He aha i akiaki ai a Allen ki te tīmata i tētahi rapu waru tau mo te Musashi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ko tana pūtea penapena i roto i te hōpara Moana** (His investment in deep-sea exploration).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""e kīia ana kua whakangao ia i te nui o āna rawa ki te torohē moana, ā, ka tīmata tana whāinga kia rapu i te Musashi mai i tana aronga mai rā anō ki te pakanga."" (It is said he has invested a lot of his wealth in deep-sea exploration, and his goal began to search for the Musashi from the time of its sinking in battle.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ōna rawa** (His wealth) - While true he *has* wealth, the passage specifies it's the *investment* of that wealth into ocean exploration that spurred the search.
* **B: Tōna hiahia ki te mahere moana** (His desire to plan for the ocean) -  Planning the expedition was a *result* of the search, not the initial motivation.
* **D: Tōna hiahia ki te whawhai** (His desire to fight) - The passage focuses on the historical interest in the *shipwreck*, not a desire for combat.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te nui o ana moni i pau i a Allen?","The correct answer is **B: hōpara moana** (ocean exploration/searching).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...e kīia ana kua whakangao ia i te nui o āna rawa ki te torohē moana..."" which translates to ""...it is said that he has spent a lot of his wealth on ocean exploration..."". 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Whakaora ana i te Musashi** (Recovering the Musashi) - While finding the Musashi is the *goal*, the passage doesn't say he's *spent* money on recovering it yet, only on searching.
*   **C: Hanga ana i tētahi ROV** (Building an ROV) - The passage mentions an ROV was *used*, but not that Allen spent a large amount of money *building* one.
*   **D: Ako mō te mahere moana** (Learning about ocean planning) - This isn’t mentioned as a significant expense.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei i puta ai ki ngā āhuatanga mōrearea i roto, i te huri noa rānei i te tipu?","The correct answer is **B: Reo Irirangi ceasium**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Kei te kitea te cesium irirangi me te iodine e tupu ana i te wāhi mahi."" (Radioactive cesium and iodine have been detected at the site.) This indicates the presence of a radioactive substance, which is a characteristic of a nuclear event.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: konuruke fuel (nuclear fuel)** - While the event *relates* to a nuclear facility, the passage doesn't say the fuel itself has been released or is exhibiting the characteristics. It detects *byproducts* of potential fuel damage.
* **C: auahi mā (smoke)** - The passage mentions smoke *coming from* the building, but the smoke isn't the characteristic of a hazardous material itself. It’s a symptom, not the cause for concern.
* **D: Iodine** - While iodine *is* detected, cesium is mentioned *along with* iodine and is the more defining indicator of a possible breach in the nuclear core.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei tohutohu e whai ake nei ehara i te tohutohu haumaru e tūtohutia ana ki ngā kainoho o te rohe whai muri i te aitua i te wheketere?,"The correct answer is **A: Karohia te whakamahinga o ngā wae āhua hau (Consider using gas masks)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the following safety instructions were given to residents:

*   **Noho iho ki rō whare (Stay indoors)**
*   **Whakaweto i ngā whāhauhau (Close windows)**
*   **Me kauaka te wai o te kōrere e inungia (Do not drink tap water)**

The passage also mentions the presence of radioactive cesium and iodine, indicating a nuclear incident. While gas masks *could* be helpful in such a situation, the passage **does not mention** recommending their use. The other options (staying indoors, closing windows, not drinking tap water) are all directly stated instructions.

Therefore, option A is the one instruction *not* mentioned as a safety measure for residents.



"
"E ai ki a Tākuta Moll, he aha te mea tino āwangawanga mō te XDR-TB?","The correct answer is **B: Te ātetetanga o te taupēnga ki ngā rongoā (The resistance of the infection to medicines)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Dr. Moll said the new strain is ""nui te tupono he mea whakararu, he mea pāwera i runga i te pāpātanga hemo tino teitei"" – which translates to ""a major concern, resistant to highly potent drugs."" This directly indicates the biggest worry is the drug resistance of XDR-TB.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ko te rerekētanga he kirimana i te hōhipera (The spread of infection in the hospital)** - While spread in the hospital *is* happening, Dr. Moll doesn't identify this as the *primary* concern.
*   **C: Te nui o ngā tāngata ka taea e tētahi tangata mate te whakaeke (The number of people one sick person can infect)** - The passage mentions 10-15 people infected per person, but doesn't present this as the biggest worry.
*   **D: He tino mate te pāpātanga (The severity of the disease)** - While a serious disease, the primary concern highlighted is its resistance to treatment.



"
E hia ngā tūroro i mate i te momo hou i whakapumautia he kaimahi hauora?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The text states: ""...tokorua i te itinga iho he kaimahi hauora hohipera."" which translates to ""...two healthcare workers were affected."" 

Therefore, two healthcare workers were affected by the new strain."
He aha te momo hangarau e whakamahia ana e te pūnaha NextGen?,"The correct answer is **A: Hangarau ā-wakarangi** (Satellite technology).

Here's why:

The passage states the NextGen system uses ""hangarau pūtake-āmiorangi"" which translates to ""space-based technology."" This refers to using satellites. The passage contrasts this with older ""pūtake-hihiani-papa"" or ""ground-based"" technology.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: hangarau tōtika** (Precision technology) - While NextGen aims for precision, this isn't *what* the technology *is*. It's a result of it.
*   **C: Hangarau ā-whenua** (Land technology) - The passage specifically contrasts this with the new system.
*   **D: Hangarau kohu waro** (Fuel efficiency technology) - This is a *benefit* of NextGen, not the technology itself.



"
He pēhea te whai painga o Te NextGen ki ngā pūmana waka ā hau?,"The correct answer is **C: he iti iho te kohu waro** (less fuel emissions).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kei ngā miriona kārani o te pēnehīni ka penapenatia ia tau, tae atu ki ngā tukunga waro."" This directly translates to ""...millions of gallons of fuel will be saved each year, including fuel emissions."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ararere rere poto ake** (shorter flights) - While NextGen *allows* for more efficient routes which *can* shorten flights, the passage doesn’t explicitly state this as a benefit.
*   **B: Ētahi atu tauwāhi rererangi pū** (more airport locations) - The passage doesn’t mention anything about new airport locations.
*   **D: Hinu iti iho** (less fuel) - While fuel *is* saved, the passage specifically highlights the reduction in *emissions* as a key benefit, making 'less fuel emissions' the more accurate answer.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha nga korero a nga kaitoi korero i whakahee i te FBI mo te aro ki runga?","The correct answer is **B: Te tohatoha i ngā rauemi ki ngā hara ngāwari te whakaoti** (Distributing resources to easy-to-solve crimes).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kua whakakoha ngā tumu kōrero i ngā kaupapa here o mua o te FBI mō te tuku i ngā rawa ki ngā kēhi he māmā te whakaoti, inarā ko ngā kēhi waka tāhae..."" This directly translates to ""The commentators criticized previous FBI policies for allocating resources to cases that were easy to solve, such as car thefts...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kei te whakarewa i tō rātou mokatere angitu** (Promoting their success rate) - The passage doesn't mention this as a criticism. It says the goal *was* to increase the success rate, but the criticism is about *how* they tried to do it.
*   **C: Arotahi taumaha ki ngā kēhi āhuaatua** (Heavy focus on high-profile cases) - The passage implies the opposite – a focus on *less* high-profile cases.
*   **D: kēhi motokā tāhae** (Car theft cases) - Car theft is *an example* of the type of case the FBI was criticized for prioritizing, not the main point of the criticism itself.



"
He aha te mahi a te FBI i runga i te kaupapa poke?,"The correct answer is **C: Me arotahi ki ngā mahi kino e māmā ana te whakaoti** (Focus on crimes that are easy to solve).

Here's why:

The passage states the FBI policies involved ""allocating resources to cases likely to be successfully resolved, such as burglary cases."" This directly translates to focusing on crimes that are easy to solve.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He nui ake ngā rauemi ki ngā kēhi motokā tāhae** (More resources to burglary cases) - While burglary cases *were* used as examples, the overarching principle was about easy-to-solve cases, not just burglaries.
* **B: Whakaarahia te mokatere angitu o te kōwhiringa** (Increase the successful rate of prosecutions) -  The goal was to *achieve* a higher success rate by focusing on winnable cases, not directly increasing the rate itself.
* **D: Ngā māngai o te tangata whenua ki ngā kēhi āhuaatua** (Representatives of the people to characteristic cases) - This isn't mentioned in the passage at all.



"
He aha te mea i tupu ki te waka ahi i urupare ki te hinganga o te JAS 39C Gripen? ,"The correct answer is **A: I hinga**.

Here's why:

The text states ""I tautuhia te paerata hei Squadron Leader Dilokrit Pattavee"" which translates to ""The pilot was identified as Squadron Leader Dilokrit Pattavee"" and then ""Kei te pūrongotia e te pāpāho o reira i tūwhiti tētahi waka ahi tauranga waka i a ia e aro atu ana"" which translates to ""The local media reports a fire truck crashed while attending to it.""  Therefore, the fire truck *crashed* (hinga) in relation to the Gripen's incident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ka huri atu** (Turned around) - The text doesn't say it turned around.
*   **C: Kua pakū** (Burst/exploded) - While the Gripen *exploded*, the text specifically refers to the fire truck *crashing*.
*   **D: I pau te korohū** (Ran out of fuel) - There's no mention of fuel issues.



"
"Whai muri i te hinganga o te JAS 39C Gripen, i kati te taunga rererangi ki te aha?","The correct answer is **A: Rerenga arumoni**.

The text states: ""...me te aukati i te tauranga waka rererangi ki ngā rerenga ahumoni."" which translates to ""...and the airfield was closed to all flight operations.""  ""Rerenga arumoni"" means flight operations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngā waka ahi** - The text mentions a fire truck *responding* to the crash, not that the airfield was closed due to fire.
* **C: Pāpāho paetata** -  The text mentions the media *reporting* on the event, but not that the airfield was closed because of them.
* **D: Ngā Kaiārahi matua** - The text identifies the pilot as Squadron Leader Dilokrit Pattavee, but doesn't say the airfield was closed related to him.



"
Ko wai i whakahaeretia e Brzezinski i te wā o te Huringa Iranian?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I tōna tūranga ki te NSA, i tautoko ia i a Carter i roto i ngā take huhua o te ao...me te uauatanga ki Iran i hua ai te raru nui ki reira i te tau 1979"". This directly links Brzezinski supporting Carter during the difficulties in Iran that led to the crisis in 1979 (the Iranian Revolution).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kissinger:** The passage says Brzezinski *followed* Kissinger as NSA, meaning he didn't work with him *during* the Iranian Revolution.
*   **B: Kennedy:** Brzezinski worked for Kennedy in the 1960s, long before the Iranian Revolution in 1979.
*   **D: Johnson:** Brzezinski also worked for Johnson in the 1960s, again before the revolution.



"
Ko wai i tū hei Kaitohutohu Haumarutanga ā-Motu tae noa ki te tau 1977?,"The correct answer is **B: Kissinger**. 

Here's why:

The passage states: ""…ka whai i a Henare Kissinger."" which translates to ""...succeeded Henry Kissinger."" This directly tells us Kissinger held the position of National Security Advisor *before* Brzezinski, and Brzezinski took over *from* him in 1977.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kōrero e kore e tino whakaatu i te mahi a Bobek ki Partizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **A: Neke atu i te 468 ngā whāinga i riro i a ia i a ia e tākaro ana mo te tīma**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states Bobek scored **403 goals in 468 appearances**. Option A says ""over 468 goals,"" which is incorrect.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: He nui ake ngā whāinga i whiwhi ai a ia i tētahi atu kaitākaro** – The passage states ""no one has contributed more to the club's success than Bobek,"" implying he scored more than anyone else.
* **C: I pōtihia ia hei kaitākaro pai rawa atu i roto i te hītori o te kapa** – The passage explicitly states he was voted the greatest player in Partizan's history in 1995.
* **D: I puta mai a ia i roto i ētahi atu kēmu i tētahi atu kaitākaro** –  He played in 468 games, which means he appeared in more games than many other players would have during that time.



"
Ko tēhea kōrero e pā ana ki te hītori o Bobek ki Partizan Belgrade he pono?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka tīmata a ia ki te tākaro mo Partizan i te 1945**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ka tūhono ia ki a rātou i te tau 1945..."" (He joined them in 1945...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I tākaro a ia mo Zagreb i mua i a Partizan Belgrade:** The passage states he was *born* in Zagreb, but doesn't say he *played* for a team there.
* **C: I tākaro a ia mo Partizan tae noa ki te 1995:** He played until 1958, not 1995. 1995 is the year he was *voted* the best player.
* **D: I rongonui ia i muri i tana pōti hei kaitakaro pai rawa atu a Partizan:** He was already famous *while* playing for Partizan, the vote in 1995 recognized his existing fame.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea āhuatanga e whakarerekē ana i nga Hesperonychus mai i te Velociraptor?","The correct answer is **B: He nui ake tōna claw tuarua** (It has a larger second claw).

Here's why:

The text states: ""I nui ake tana matikara tua rua, nō reira i ara ake ai te ingoa Hesperonychus """"te mati o te uru"""" e kī ana."" This directly translates to ""It had a larger second claw, hence the name Hesperonychus """"the claw of the west"""".""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E rua ōna waewae** (It has two legs) - The text says it walked on two legs, which is common for Dromaeosauridae/Velociraptor.
*   **C: He tinana huruhuru katoa tōna** (It has a fully feathered body) - The text states it was a fully feathered animal, but this is a shared characteristic with Velociraptor, not a difference.
*   **D: He toto mahana** (It is warm-blooded) -  The text also states it was warm-blooded, but this is also a shared trait, not a distinguishing feature.



"
"""Ko te tikanga o """"Hesperonychus"""" i takea mai i te āhuatanga ōkiko o te momo?""","The correct answer is **A: Te maikuku (nga)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""nō reira i ara ake ai te ingoa Hesperonychus """"te mati o te uru"""" e kī ana."" This translates to ""therefore the name Hesperonychus 'the claw of the west' arose.""  The passage also explicitly links *Hesperonychus* to having claws *like* Velociraptor.  Therefore, the name is derived from its claws.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nga tinana huruhuru (The feathered bodies):** While the passage mentions feathers, it doesn't say the name *Hesperonychus* comes from them.
* **C: Nga waewae (The legs):**  The passage discusses walking on two legs, but doesn’t link the name to the legs themselves.
* **D: Te ngutu (The beak):** The passage doesn't mention anything about a beak.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki te pupuhi he pono?,"The correct answer is **C: Kotahi tau i mārena ai te tokorua i mua i Buffalo**.

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Kua mārena te tokorua ki Texas mō te kotahi tau ki muri, ā, ka haere mai ki Buffalo hei whakanui ki ngā hoa mengā whanaunga."" This directly translates to ""The couple got married in Texas a year ago, and came to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and family.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: No Texas te tāne me te wahine** - While they *got married* in Texas, the text doesn't state they are *from* Texas. The groom was born in Buffalo.
*   **B: Tokorima nga tūpāpaku** - The text says ""tokowhā i mate i te pūtanga"" (four died in the shooting), not five.
*   **D: I pā mai te tākaro i Buffalo** - The text mentions a shooting (""pūtanga""), but doesn't specify it was a ""tākaro"" (game). It was a shooting incident.



"
Ko tēhea kōrero e pā ana ki te kaupapa i puta ai te pupuhi e tika ana?,"The correct answer is **A: I puta mai i tētahi pō whakanui i Buffalo**.

Here's why:

The passage states the couple came to Buffalo ""hei whakanui ki ngā hoa mengā whanaunga"" (to celebrate with friends and family). The outbreak happened after a party, and the passage specifically links it to the celebrations in Buffalo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I pā mai i tētahi takahanga huritau tika** - While there *was* a birthday gathering planned, the outbreak happened at the initial party, not the birthday gathering itself.
* **C: I pā mai ki tētahi rōpū i Texas** - The couple was married in Texas a year prior, but the outbreak occurred *after* they traveled to Buffalo.
* **D: I pā mai i te mārena o te mārena o te tokorua** - The outbreak happened a year *after* the wedding.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te māharahara tuatahi i waenganui i nga kaiwhakahaere e pā ana ki te Luno?","The correct answer is **C: maringi hinu (oil spill)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""i te tuatahi i āwangawanga ngā āpiha kei maringi te kawenga"" which translates to ""initially the officers were worried about an oil spill"". This directly identifies the initial concern of the officers regarding the Luno.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te kore utanga kaiwhenua (lack of cargo)** - The passage mentions the ship was *going to* pick up its cargo, not that it lacked it initially.
*   **B: Ngā ngaru me ngā hau tiketike (waves and strong winds)** - While waves and winds *caused* the ship to break up, they weren't the initial worry of the officers. They were a contributing factor to the event.
*   **D: Ngā whara tūpāpaku ki ngā mema kaimahi (fatal injuries to crew members)** - Injuries happened *after* the ship broke up, they weren't the initial concern.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki te wehenga o Luno ehara i te tika?","The correct answer is **A: I puta te raru i mua i te tango i te utanga** (The problem occurred before taking on the load).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""I te ara te kaipuke 100-mita te roa hei tiki i tōna kawenga whakahaumako noa, ā, i te tuatahi i āwangawanga ngā āpiha kei maringi te kawenga."" This means the ship was *on its way to pick up* its cargo, and the officers were initially concerned about the cargo's stability. The problem happened *while* trying to load, not before.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: E 100 mita te pūngao o te kaipuke i runga i te wā i pakaru ai** (The ship was 100 meters long at the time it broke apart) - Directly stated in the passage.
* **C: I roto i ngā mema o te kapa tekau mā rua, kotahi i whara** (Of the twelve-person crew, one was injured) - ""I ora ngā kaimahi tekau mā rua e te topatopa, i toto noa iho te ihu a tētahi.""
* **D: I panaia te kaipuke ki roto i te wai pakaru** (The ship was pushed into rough waters) - ""I panaia atu e ngā hau pūkeri me ngā ngaru ki te waiwhawhati.""



"
I te tekau tau i whiwhi ai a Algeria i te rangatiratanga?,"The correct answer is **C: 1960s**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I ngā tau 1960 i hoki ake mātou ki te motuhaketanga-hou o Algeria ki te whakaako i te arataki kiriata."" This translates to ""In the 1960s we returned to newly independent Algeria to teach film direction.""

Therefore, the passage directly links Vautier's return to Algeria with its newfound independence in the 1960s.



"
I hea i kore ai e whakaturia ngā mata pouaka whakaata mō te tangihanga?,"The correct answer is **D: I St. Tapawhā o Pita**.

Here's why:

The passage states that because so many people couldn't *get into* St. Peter's Square, large screens were set up *in other places in Rome* and other cities. This implies screens weren't needed *at* St. Peter's Square itself - the problem was too many people for the space.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Puta noa i Roma** - Screens *were* set up in Rome.
*   **B: I roto i nga taone rereke o Itari** - Screens *were* set up in other Italian cities.
*   **C: I ētahi tauwāhi i Pōrana** - Screens *were* set up in Poland.



"
I hea te hui nehunga i puritia?,"The correct answer is **C: I St. Tapawhā o Pita**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kāore i taea e te katoa te tangihanga nei ki St. Pita Tapawhā te tomo."" (Not everyone could enter St. Peter's Square for the funeral.) This clearly indicates the main funeral service was held at St. Peter's Square.
* While large screens were set up in Rome, Poland, and other cities, these were *to view* the service, not to *hold* the service itself.  The passage explicitly says the funeral was *at* St. Peter's Square.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I ngā tauwāhi maha puta noa i Roma:**  While screens were in multiple locations, the *funeral* itself wasn't held in many places.
* **B: I Pōrana:** Poland had screens to *watch* the funeral, but it wasn't the location of the service.
* **D: Tuatahi i Roma, kātahi i tētahi atu taone Itari:** The funeral started and primarily happened in Rome (St. Peter's Square), and wasn’t repeated in another Italian city.



"
"Whai muri i te pahūtanga, ko wai i whakahaeretia mō ngā whara nui?","The correct answer is **A: Tokorima neke atu rānei ngā tāngata** (Five or more people).

The passage states: ""tokorima ngā tāngata i te itinga iho ki te wāhi i te wā o te pahū i taurimatia mō ngā tohumate o te oho mauri."" This translates to ""five people who were at the scene at the time of the explosion were treated for shock."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Karekau he tangata** (No one) - The passage explicitly states five people were treated.
* **C: He kaiwhakahaere o te kamupene korohū** (A gas company official) - While a gas company official *attended* the scene, they weren't *treated* for injuries.
* **D: He hoa noho** (A resident) - The passage states no one was *living* in the building, and while residents were evacuated, it doesn’t say they were injured and treated.



"
Ko wai i pūrongo i te māturu korohū?,"The correct answer is **C: He mana o te kamupene korohū** (An officer from the gas company).

Here's why:

The text states: ""I tae atu tētahi āpiha nō te kamupene haurehu ki te wāhi rā i muri i te waeatanga atu a tētahi kiritata mō tētahi komama haurehu."" (An officer from the gas company arrived at the scene after a call for a gas leak.) This directly indicates someone from the gas company reported the leak.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He hoa noho i roto i te whare** (A resident in the house) - The text states no one was living in the building.
*   **B: Te tangata e noho ana i roto i te whare noho** (The person living in the apartment) -  Again, no one was living there.
*   **D: Te kaiwhakahaere whare** (The property manager) - The text doesn't mention the property manager reporting anything.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, e hia nga tāngata i mate i roto i te whakaeke?","The correct answer is **B: 2**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ko Nicholas Alden 25 me Zachary Cuddeback 21 ngā tūpapaku"" which translates to ""Nicholas Alden 25 and Zachary Cuddeback 21 are the deceased.""

Therefore, two people died in the attack. While others were injured, only Alden and Cuddeback are explicitly stated as having died.



"
Ko wai te patu i kore e pupuhi i tētahi wā i te whakaeke?,"The correct answer is **B: Uka**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""I raru te pū a Uka i te hikitanga ake ki te tangata tuarima.""  This translates to ""Uka's gun jammed when firing at the fifth person.""  A jammed gun means it *didn't* fire.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **Cuddeback:** The text states Cuddeback was the shooter, so his gun *did* fire.
*   **Schneider:** Schneider was injured, he didn't have issues with his weapon.
*   **Alden:**  The text doesn’t mention any weapon issues with Alden.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā hākinakina e whai ake nei i whakakorea i te hōtaka Olympic?,"The correct answer is **A: Squash**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""I ngana te poipātū, te karāti me ngā hākinakina rōra te eke ki te hōtaka o Ngā Taumāhekeheke o te Ao, tae atu hoki ki te peihipaoro me te poiuka, i pōtitia kia panaia atu ērā i Ngā Taumāhekeheke o te Ao i te tau 2005.""

*   **Poipātū** translates to **Squash**.
*   **Karate** is mentioned directly.
*   **Poiuka** translates to **Pool/Billiards**
*   **Peihipaoro** translates to **Baseball/Softball**

The question asks which sport was *removed* from the Olympic program. Squash and Karate were attempts to get *into* the program, but the text specifically states that Squash, Karate, Pool/Billiards and Baseball/Softball were *voted out* in 2005. While Karate is listed, Squash is the only option that aligns directly with the text regarding removal.

Therefore, Squash is the correct answer."
Ko tēhea o ngā hākinakina e whai ake nei i pōtihia e te Komiti Olympic o Te Ao kia whakaurua ki roto i ngā kēmu?,"The correct answer is **A: Te hakinakina roera (Roller sports)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I tohua ko te whutupōro me te Korowhā, e rima atu ngā hākinakina kāore i whakaarotia kia uru mai ki te whakataetae Orimipia.""  This translates to ""Squash and racquetball, and five other sports not previously considered to be included in the Olympic competition.""  Later it specifically mentions ""te poipātū, te karāti me ngā hākinakina rōra"" as having tried to get into the World Games program, and therefore being considered for the Olympics.  ""Ngā hākinakina rōra"" translates to ""roller sports"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Poitake (Bowling):** The passage mentions bowling was rejected in 2005.
* **C: Uniana Rugby (Union Rugby):** The passage mentions rugby was rejected in 2005.
* **D: Poi ngohengohe (Billiards/Pool):** The passage mentions billiards/pool was rejected in 2005.



"
I rīhi tuatahitia e Arthur Papawhenua te Kēti o St James' Brewery mo te maha o nga tau?,"The correct answer is **D: 9000**.

The passage states that Arthur Guinness leased the brewery for **9,000 years**. While the passage mentions 250 years later and other numbers, the question specifically asks about the *initial* lease length."
E hia ngā piriona tāra e kawea mai ana e Guinness ia tau?,"The correct answer is **D: 10**.

The text states Guinness generates 10 billion euros (US$14.7 billion) each year. The question asks for the number of *billions of dollars* (tāra), and while it also gives the euro amount, the dollar equivalent is US$14.7 billion, meaning the closest whole number in the options is 10 (from the 10 billion euros).
"
E hia ngā whenua i roto i te Kotahitanga Pākehā kua kitea te huaketo H5N1?,"The correct answer is **D: waru** (eight).

Here's why:

The text states that the H5N1 virus has affected birds in the following European countries:

1. Austria
2. Germany
3. Poland
4. Bulgaria
5. Czech Republic
6. Italy
7. France (Wīwi)
8. Croatia & Denmark (cases not yet confirmed, but mentioned as affected)

Therefore, eight countries within the European Union have been affected by the H5N1 virus.



"
Kei hea te take hōu rawa o te huaketo H5N1 i kitea?,"The correct answer is **A: Wīwī**.

The text states: ""...kia pāngia tētahi rakiraki puihi kua mate, i kitea i te Mane, i roto i te rēpō tata atu ki Lyon i te rāwhiti o **Wīwi**."" ( ...to affect a dead wild bird, discovered on Monday, in a repository near Lyon in eastern **France**.)

Therefore, the new case of the H5N1 virus was found in France (Wīwi).



"
Nō whea te wā whakamutunga i tutaki ai a Haiti ki te mate i mua i te horahanga e ngā hoia rangimarie?,"The correct answer is **B: I mua noa atu i te taenga mai o nga hōia**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kua kōrero tohutoru te Haitian Institute for Justice and Democracy i ngā rangahau motuhake e marohi ana i kawea i runga i te kore mōhio te ope mau i te rongo Nepōra nō te Kotahitanga o Ngā Iwi o te Ao i te tahumaero ki Haiti. I mua i te taenga atu o ngā ope tauā, kua kore a Haiti i te pāngia e ngā raru e pā ana ki te tahumaero mai i te rautau 1800.""

This translates to: ""The Haitian Institute for Justice and Democracy has repeatedly stated that research strongly suggests the peacekeeping force unknowingly brought the cholera to Haiti. **Before the arrival of the troops**, Haiti had not been affected by cholera problems since the 1800s.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te 1800s:** While the text mentions the 1800s, it states Haiti hadn't had cholera *since* then, not that the last outbreak was *in* the 1800s.
*   **C: I mua i te rū:** The text specifies the outbreak happened *after* the earthquake (rū).
*   **D: I te tau 2009:** No mention of 2009 is made in the provided text.



"
He aha te wāhi i puta mai ai ngā ururua ki te horahanga o te mate?,"The correct answer is **A: Te Awa o Artibonite**.

The text explicitly states: ""…ngā uruurua mai i te puni UN kāore i tika te horoihia, nā tēnā i uru ngā huakita ki te Awa o Artibonite…"" (…the bacteria from the UN base were not properly treated, causing the contamination to enter the Artibonite River…).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ko te puni UN** - While the bacteria *originated* from the UN base, it was the river that became the source of the spread of the disease.
* **C: Te pae o te rū 2010** - This marks the time the UN forces arrived, but isn't the *place* the bacteria spread from.
* **D: Te Whare Wānanga o Haiti mo te Ture me te Kāwanatanga ā Iwi** - This is the Haitian Institute for Justice and Democracy, who *investigated* the issue, not where the bacteria spread.



"
He aha te mea e whakaaro ana te kāwanatanga o Iraki ki te mahi?,"The correct answer is **B: Whakanohoia he ture kaha ake mo te whakaaetanga o nga raau taero (Enact stronger laws for drug approvals)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Jordanian government is **strengthening the legal framework to address the situation** and that from a governmental representative's view, **it is now important from a health and legal perspective to expedite legislation.** The Minister of Health is concerned about people's lives being at risk due to **various potent recipes and toxic effects stemming from new laws being enacted.**  

This all points to the government reacting to problems *with* existing laws around drugs (likely approvals and quality control) and seeking to create *stronger* regulations. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tukuna atu ngā whakapae ki te hunga hara rongoā (Prosecute drug offenders):** While prosecution might be a part of a broader strategy, the passage focuses on *preventative* legal changes – strengthening approvals – not just punishing those breaking existing laws.
* **C: Ngā ture Relax mo te whakawāteatanga o ngā rongoā (Relax laws for dispensing drugs):** The passage explicitly states the government is *strengthening* laws, the opposite of relaxing them.
* **D: Whakapakūtia ngā rongoā (Ban drugs):** A blanket ban isn't indicated. The concern is about quality control and the dangers of unregulated recipes.



"
He aha te mea i ture mo te wa poto i Ireland?,"The correct answer is **D: Nga raau taero (Drugs)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Irish government is rushing to amend legislation to address ""the situation"" and that the Minister for Health is concerned about people's lives being affected by ""various potent trends"" *and* ""harm reductions stemming from new laws passed."" This strongly implies the situation and the new laws relate to **drugs** and harm reduction strategies surrounding them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tahaehae (Theft):** The passage doesn't mention theft.
*   **B: Te tinihanga (Prostitution):** The passage doesn't mention prostitution.
*   **C: Huaki (Fraud):** The passage doesn't mention fraud.



"
He aha te hunga hara i whakawāteatia?,"The correct answer is **C: Te whakakino (Vandalism)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the suspect is being investigated for altering peace signs and hearts to resemble obscenities (""O"" to ""e""). This act of defacing symbols falls under the definition of vandalism (whakakino in Māori).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te takahi (Trespassing):** This refers to illegally entering property, which isn't mentioned.
*   **B: Tūkino ōkiko (Aggravated assault):** This implies physical harm, which isn't described.
*   **D: tāhae (Theft):** This means stealing, which isn't the action being described.



"
"I a ia e huri ana i te tohu, he aha te mea kihai i mahia e te whakapae?","The correct answer is **C: Tūkino ā-tinana** (Physical assault).

Here's why:

The text states: ""**Kāore i whakakino ā-kikotia te tohu**"" which translates to ""**The sign was not physically damaged**"".  This directly indicates that physical assault (tūkino ā-tinana) of the sign *did not* happen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hurihia tētahi o ana reta** (Changed one of its letters) - The text *says* letters were changed (""whakamahia te whakarerekētanga ki ngā tāpōrena pango..."")
*   **B: Whakatau ki tētahi tohu rangimārie** (Decided on a peace sign) - The text mentions using peace signs *as part of* the alteration.
*   **D: Whakamahia ngā tarpaulins hei whakakē** (Used tarpaulins to cover) - This isn't mentioned in the text.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i whakapaea e te kaiako English Karno?","The correct answer is **B: mā te noho ki tētahi ākonga** (sitting on a student).

Here's why:

The passage states Karno was accused of:

*   **Tā ana i ngā pānuitanga kāore i te whakaaetia** (posting unauthorized notices) - ""Nā Modern Education ia i whakapae ki te tā i ngā pānui rahi ki ngā pahi horekau te whakamana...""
*   **Whakamahi ana i te reo kīrehu ki roto i te akomanga** (using inappropriate language in the classroom) - ""whakamahi ia i te reo kīrehu ki roto i te akomanga...""
*   **Hara tūkino mana pupuri** (abuse of power) - ""Kua whakapaetia anō ia mō te hara tūkino mana pupuri...""

It *doesn't* mention any accusation of him physically sitting on a student. 

**Takahi manatārua** (breach of confidence) and **reo noa i te tauaha** (using simple language in class) are not directly mentioned as accusations either, but abuse of power and inappropriate language are strongly implied. Thus, option B is the only option that can be confidently ruled out as an accusation made against Karno.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, kaore nei i taunutia e Rolando Mendoza?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā tūruhi (The tourists)**.

The text states: ""Kua whakamauria e tētahi pirihimana nō Piripīni o mua ngā **tūruhi Hong Kong** nā te kāhaki i tō rātou pahi ki Manila..."" (A former Philippine police officer took Hong Kong **tourists** hostage after their bus was blocked in Manila...) and ""...i puhia e Rolando Mendoza tana raiwhara M16 ki ngā **tūruhi**."" (...Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the **tourists**.)

Therefore, Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists.



"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, kāore i whakaūngia ngā taupānga i te wā e tukua wawetia ana?","The correct answer is **A: Nga tūruhi (The tourists)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle *at the tourists*."" The question asks who were not identified while being held hostage. The passage directly links the hostage situation to the tourists.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Te kaumātua (The elderly):** While the elderly were *among* the hostages, the question is about who weren't identified *during* the initial taking of hostages.
*   **C: Nga kaiwhakaahua (The journalists):** The journalists positioned themselves after the initial hostage taking.
*   **D: Nga tamariki (The children):** Like the elderly, children were *among* the hostages but not the primary group whose identification was an issue during the initial event.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko wai e kohikohi waitohu ana hei tautoko i te whakamana i te mārena ōrite i Paratira?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā kaiwhakahē (The protestors/opponents)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kei te tūmanakohia e ngā kaitautohe te kohi i te pētihana o te 1.2 miriona mokotā hei tuku ki te National Congress hei te Noema.""  This translates to ""The protestors are expected to collect a petition of 1.2 million signatures to submit to the National Congress by November.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Roberto Jefferson:** The text says the bill is *with* him, but doesn't mention him collecting signatures.
*   **C: Te Hāhi Katorika o Rōmana (The Roman Catholic Church):** The text states the church *opposes* same-sex marriage, so they wouldn't be collecting signatures to *support* it.
*   **D: Marta Suplicy:** She authored the original bill, but the text doesn't say she's currently collecting signatures.



"
Ko wai e hoatu ai e ngā kaiwhakatuma ā rātou tono?,"The correct answer is **C: Te Rōpū ā Iwi o Parīhi (The National Congress of Brazil)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kua 10 tau e tautohetohe ana te **National Congress o Parihi** mō te whakature, ā, ko tēnei momo mārenatanga e whakaaetia ana e te ture ki Rio Grande do Sul anake.""  This means the National Congress of Brazil is the one actively lobbying for the law change and will receive the petition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te Hāhi Katorika o Rōmana (The Roman Catholic Church):** The text states the Catholic Church *opposes* the law, they are not receiving the petition.
*   **B: Roberto Jefferson:** He currently *holds* the bill, but isn't the recipient of the petition being collected.
*   **D: Ko te koromatua o São Paulo (The governor of São Paulo):** While Marta Suplicy (former governor of São Paulo) initially authored the bill, the petition is directed to the National Congress, not the governor.



"
"E ai ki te kōrero a Armand Versace, he aha te mea i tupu i mua tonu i te tīmata o te mano ki te urupare ki te rangi?","The correct answer is **C: He hau taumaha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka rima meneti i muri i te whakaaturanga ka tīmata tētahi hau te pupuhi, ā, kotahi meneti whai muri ake, kua tae atu te hau ki te 70km/h..."" (Five minutes after the show began a wind started to blow, and one minute later the wind reached 70km/h...).  This establishes a strong wind *before* anything starts flying into the air.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kua tīmata te whatu** - While rain *did* come, it wasn't the first thing to happen. The wind came first.
*   **B: E rima meneti i muri i te whakaaturanga** - This simply states *when* the wind began, not *what* happened.
*   **D: I ngaro i a ia te ara o tētahi mema whānau** - This is something Armand Versace *experienced as a result* of the events, not what *caused* things to start flying.



"
"E ai ki a Versace, i te wā i tīmata ai ngā hau kaha rawa?","The correct answer is **A: I ētahi meneti i muri i te tīmatanga o te whakaaturanga**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ka rima meneti i muri i te tīmatanga o te whakaaturanga ka tīmata tētahi hau te pupuhi..."" (Five minutes after the start of the show a wind began to blow...). This directly answers the question of when the strong winds started, according to Versace.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: I muri iho i te marangai** - The rain came *after* the wind was already strong.
*   **C: I muri i tana ngaronga i tōna tuahine** - His sister's disappearance happened *during* the storm, it wasn't the start of it.
*   **D: I mua i te whatu** - The text doesn't state the wind started before the rain.



"
"I mua i a Fred, e hia nga tupuhi nui i tuhia ki te rawhiti o te 35°W?","The correct answer is **B: Toru**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ko Fred te haumātakataka takiwā pārū kaha rawa kua pūrongotia mai ki tēnei wā ki te tonga me te rāwhiti ki te Atlantic mai i te ōrokohanga mai o ngā whakaahua āmiorangi, ā, ko te haumātakataka matua tuatoru anake kua pūrongotia ki te rāwhiti o 35 tākiri ki te Uru.""

This translates to: ""Fred is the strongest tropical storm reported to date in the south and east of the Atlantic since the beginning of satellite imagery, and is only the third major storm reported east of 35°W.""

Therefore, before Fred, there were **three** major storms reported east of 35°W (including Fred making it the third).



"
"I te wā i tū a Fred i te taha o ngā motu o Cape Verde, he aha te aronga i ahu ai?","The correct answer is **D: Te raki-māraki** (Northwest).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ko Fred kei te neke atu ki te raki mā-uru."" This translates to ""Fred is moving towards the northwest.""  Therefore, when Fred was near the Cape Verde islands, it was traveling in a **northwest** direction.



"
Ko wai o enei e whai ake nei he tere ake te tere atu i o mua?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ko ngā tere o te 802.11n he tino tere ake i tērā o ngā mea o mua..."" which translates to ""The speeds of 802.11n are significantly faster than those of the previous ones..."". 

The other options (802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11a) are listed as being *preceded* by 802.11n, implying they are slower."
He aha te mea e hiahiatia ana kia hototahi ai te 802.11n ki te 802.11b?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngā reo irirangi takirua (Multiple radio frequencies)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that 802.11n is backward compatible with 802.11a, b, and g *because* it utilizes dual-band transmission (2.4GHz and 5.0GHz). This dual-band capability allows it to communicate with older standards like 802.11b which operate on the 2.4GHz frequency.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He tere ake te tere (Faster speed):** While 802.11n *is* faster, speed isn't what enables backward compatibility.
*   **B: Ko te kaha mō te 802.11b hei mahi i te 5.0Ghz (The ability for 802.11b to operate at 5.0Ghz):** 802.11b does *not* operate at 5.0GHz. It operates at 2.4GHz.
*   **C: He tautohe o te 600Mbit/s (A speed of 600Mbit/s):** This is the *maximum* speed of 802.11n, not a requirement for compatibility with older standards.



"
E hia ngā whakataetae i tae atu ai te toa koura o te Olympics ki ngā kēmu Commonwealth?,"The correct answer is **B: Toru (Three)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...i ki ngā tānga e toru ki ngā Commonwealth Games..."" which translates to ""...and to three entries to the Commonwealth Games..."". 

Therefore, the swimmer has been selected for three events at the Commonwealth Games."
He aha i kore ai te toa koura o te Olympics e tango rongoā mō tōna mamae?,"The correct answer is **D: Kāore e whakaaetia i ngā kēmu Commonwealth** (Not allowed in the Commonwealth Games).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...kāore ia i āhei te kai i ngā pūroi e hiahiatia ana hei where i tana mamae nā te mea kei te aukatihai i ngā Kēmu.""  This translates to ""...he couldn't take the medicine needed to treat his pain because it's banned in the Games.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kaore i mamae a ia (He wasn't in pain):** The passage explicitly states he *was* in pain (""tana mamae"").
* **B: Nāna a ia i mate ai (He died):** The passage refers to his ""mate"" but this means his condition/illness, not that he died.
* **C: I māharahara a ia ka pā kino ki tōna kaha (He worried and it affected his strength):** While worry might be a factor, the primary reason he couldn't take medicine is due to the Games' rules.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha pea i pōraruraru ai mo te mahi rū?","The correct answer is **A: Te aroaro o nga kapua pōuri** (The presence of dark clouds).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nā ngā kapua pea i rangirua ai mēnā rānei kua pahū tūturu mai."" which translates to ""The clouds may have caused confusion as to whether a real eruption had occurred."" This directly links the dark clouds to potential problems/confusion regarding the volcanic activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ngā pūrongotia mai i te Tari Tirorangi Tiorangiana** (Reports from the Icelandic Meteorological Office) - The reports *state* there was no activity, they didn't *cause* problems.
*   **C: Te mahere rū o te ao whānui** (The global earthquake map) - This refers to a map showing earthquakes globally and is unrelated to the volcanic activity's confusion.
*   **D: I pūrongotia ngā ngohe i ētahi atu wāhi o Tiorangiana** (Earthquakes were reported in other parts of Iceland) - The passage does not mention earthquakes causing confusion with the volcanic activity.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i te wā i puta ai tētahi huringa wāhanga?","The correct answer is **C: I te 10 o Mati** (March 10th).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nā ngā mahi rū hira i puta mai te panoni wā i tū i te 10 o Māehe ki te taha raki mā rāwhiti o te tawhā o te tihi o te rangitoto."" This translates to ""The seismic activity resulted in a time distortion that occurred on March 10th to the northeast of the volcano's summit.""

Therefore, the time distortion (huringa wāhanga) occurred on March 10th.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki te pūtirotiro marama a Chandrayaan-1 ehara i te pono?,"The correct answer is **A: He kaimahi to te kaiāwhiti nāna i whakarewa te rūpahu** (A crew was on board the probe when it launched).

Here's why:

* **The passage states: ""Ko te waka ātea kore tangata...""** - This translates to ""The unmanned spacecraft..."" This directly contradicts option A, which claims there was a crew.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: Kei roto i te tirotiro nga taputapu tino nui** (The probe contained important scientific instruments) - The passage says: ""Atu i te kawe i ngā taputapu pūtaiao hira e toru"" (Besides carrying three important scientific instruments).
* **C: I angitu te pananga o te tirotiro** (The probe’s landing was successful) - The passage states it ""successfully descended close to the South Pole of the Moon.""
* **D: Kua peitatia e te rūpahu nga taha** (The probe has photographed all sides) - The passage says it ""photographed the national flag of India, plastered on all sides.""



"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e whakaahua tika ana i te pūtaiao marama?,"The correct answer is **B: He angitu tana taunga tukinga**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ka angitū te tau iho pātata nei ki te pou tonga o te Marama."" This directly translates to ""...successfully landed near the south pole of the Moon.""  ""Taunga tukinga"" means landing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I ū ki te taha ki te taha ki te raki o te Marama:** The passage states it landed near the *south* pole, not the north.
* **C: I werohia mai i te āwhiotanga tārewa:** The passage doesn't mention being launched from a rocket. It focuses on the mission *after* launch.
* **D: E rua nga taputapu tino nui e mau ana:** The passage states it carried *three* important scientific instruments, not two.



"
"I runga anō i te whakawhitinga, ko tēhea te mehua parenga ki te mate ka whakatinanatia whakamutunga?","The correct answer is **C: Kano kano encephalitis**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kua oatitia te tini miriona ipu o te ārai mate encephalitis e te kāwanatanga..."" (The government has procured millions of doses of the encephalitis vaccine...). This directly links encephalitis to being a disease the government is preparing for and trying to prevent.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pesticides:** While the government took actions related to pigs (which might involve pesticide use), the passage doesn't state pesticides are the disease being targeted.
*   **B: Ngā hopu Pig (Pig catchers):** These are mentioned as a *response* to the problem, not the problem itself.
*   **D: pihi waeroa (mosquito coils):** These are likely used to *prevent* bites that could spread disease, but are not the disease itself.



"
Me pēhea te whakawhiti o te mate ki te tangata?,"The correct answer is **C: Poaka (Pigs)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kei te kawea te tahumaero e te poaka, kātahi ka neke ki te tangata ki te naenae.""  This translates to ""The disease is carried by pigs, then moves to humans through the snout.""

Therefore, pigs are the intermediary in the transmission of the disease to humans.



"
He aha te hua o te rahunga o te rerenga tuarua?,"The correct answer is **B: He mana ā muri ake ki ngā whakakotahitanga ā-iwi ōrite** (More power to same-sex unions).

Here's why:

The passage states ""Ko te hinganga o te whiunga tuarua, e marohi ana kia whakakore i ngā civil union takatāpui, ka whakatuwhera pea i te kuaha mō ngā civil unions hei te wā e heke mai ana.""  This translates to ""The fall of the second reading, which aims to abolish same-sex civil unions, may open the door for civil unions in the future."" 

This indicates the removal of the second reading *creates the possibility* for more power or acceptance of same-sex unions, not an immediate result like a review (A), a surprise legal meeting (C), or the abolition of such unions (D).  While HJR-3 will be reviewed, that's a *consequence* of the situation, not the direct result of the second reading falling.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i te mukutanga o te rerenga tuarua?","The correct answer is **B: I te tau 2011**.

The passage states: ""Kua mana te whakahounga mō ngā whare e rua i te tau 2011."" (The amendment for the two houses was authorized in 2011.)  This directly answers the question about when the second reading occurred.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I te wā o te hui ture** (During the legal session) - While it happened *during* a legal session, the passage specifies *when* that session was.
* **C: I te Mane** (On Monday) - The passage mentions ""Henate Mane"" (Monday Senate) but this refers to the Senate's action, not the initial reading.
* **D: I te tau 2015** (In 2015) - 2015 is when further review and voting are *expected*, not when the second reading happened.



"
"""Ki a wai i puta mai ai ngā """"Panama Papers""""?""","The correct answer is **A: Te umanga o Mossack Fonseca**.

The passage states: ""Ko te """"Pepa Panama"""" he tapanga amarara mō ngā pukapuka e tekau miriona mai i te whare ture Panama **Mossack Fonseca** i hurangia ki te perehi..."" (The ""Panama Papers"" are a leak of millions of documents from the Panama law firm **Mossack Fonseca** released in the spring of 2016...).

Therefore, the Panama Papers originated from the firm Mossack Fonseca.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko wai i kī te press Ingarangi e whakahaere ana i te nuinga o ngā kamupene i whakamahia hei huna i te taonga?","The correct answer is **C: Te Pēke Pānui (Deutsche Bank)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""E mea ana te niupepa o Ingarangi, te Guardian i tutuki ai tēnei āhuatanga nā te mea ko tōna hautoru i roto i te 1200 ngā kamupene i tiakina e Deutsche Bank."" 

This translates to: ""The British newspaper, The Guardian, achieved this feature because of its stake in the 1200 companies protected by Deutsche Bank.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly identifies Deutsche Bank as being heavily involved with the companies used to hide assets.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā aitua rererangi e whai ake nei i tino mate?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka hinga te waka rererangi i tōna haerenga ki Aramenia mai i Irana** (The plane crashed on its journey to Armenia from Iran).

Here's why:

The text states: ""I tērā marama i kitea e Irāna tana aituā hau takiwā kino rawa mō ngā tini tau i te tukituki a tētahi waka rererangi e haere ana ki Amēnia, me te whakamate i te 168 ki runga."" This directly translates to ""Last month, Iran experienced its worst air disaster in decades with the crash of a plane heading to Armenia, killing 168 on board.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: I hinga te hepa pirihimana** (The police helicopter crashed) - The text mentions a police helicopter crash, but it resulted in 3 deaths, far fewer than the 168.
*   **C: Kai te hinga te waka rererangi ki Irana mai i Aramenia** (The plane is crashing into Iran from Armenia) - The text states the plane was *heading to* Armenia *from* Iran when it crashed.
*   **D: I hinga te waka rererangi i Mashhad** (The plane crashed in Mashhad) - While a plane did crash near Mashhad, it resulted in 77 deaths, significantly less than the Armenia crash.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te take mo te tini o nga aitua rererangi e puta ana i Iran?,"The correct answer is **D: He waka rererangi kore e tiakina** (Unmaintained aircraft).

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""kei a rātou te kāhui pakeke haere e kino ana te tuarā mō ngā paheko tūmatanui, ope tauā anō hoki"" which translates to ""they have an aging fleet with a poor safety record for passenger planes, and military aircraft as well."" This points to a lack of maintenance as a core problem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He rererangi tawhito o ngā rererangi tūmatanui, hōia hoki** (Old passenger and military aircraft) - While true, this *is* a result of the underlying problem (lack of resources/maintenance) rather than the root cause.
* **B: Kāore he pūtea e āhei ai te hoko waka rererangi hou** (No funds to buy new aircraft) - The passage mentions sanctions preventing purchases (""Ko te hua o ngā aukati ā-ao e kore e taea ngā waka rererangi hou te hoko"") but this is a *consequence* of the situation, not the direct cause of the accidents.  Old planes were flying *before* the sanctions made new purchases impossible.
* **C: Ko ngā whiu e ārai ana i ngā hoko waka rererangi hou** (Sanctions hindering new aircraft purchases) - Similar to B, this explains *why* they can't get new planes, but doesn't explain the accidents happening *now* with the existing fleet.



Therefore, the most direct and accurate answer is that unmaintained aircraft (D) are the primary reason for the high number of plane crashes in Iran, as highlighted in the text."
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i whakaurua ki te pūrongo a te Rōpū Ako mo Iraki?,"The correct answer is **B: He whakapuakanga mā ētahi huringa ka taea te karo i te piki haere o te tutu i Iraki.**

Here's why:

The passage states the report is a ""warning, not a silver bullet"" and doesn't suggest changes will *prevent* escalating violence. It acknowledges ongoing violence (""the continuing bloodshed"") and doesn't offer a solution to avoid it.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: He whakahē i te kaupapahere o nāianei:** The report calls for ""a fresh perspective"" and a new approach, which implies criticism of the current policy.
*   **C: Ngā tūtohutanga kia haumaru ai ngā taitapa o Iraki:** The recommendation to establish border security (""set territorial limits"") directly addresses securing Iraq's borders and thus, protecting its people.
*   **D: He inoi mo tētahi whakaaetanga ki a Mātau:** The passage explicitly states the report ""calls for a broad consensus and a commitment from the United States on Middle East policy.""



"
Ko tehea o ngā mea e whai ake nei kāore i whakatenatenahia e te Rōpū Ako mo Iraki i roto i tana pūrongo?,"The correct answer is **A: Kia whakapuakina he taurangi kia mutu ai te piki haere o te tutu**.

Here's why:

The passage states the report is a warning that ""no one can guarantee success...regardless of the level of violence, the continuing sectarian strife, or the attitude of the Sunni population toward Iraq."" It focuses on broader strategies like diplomatic efforts, a new comprehensive strategy, border security, and rebuilding relationships.  It doesn't mention a specific call for declaring a ceasefire to reduce violence.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

* **B: He huringa aronga ināianei tonu (An immediate change of course):** The report advocates for a ""new approach.""
* **C: Te whakamahinga o te taupatupatu tuwhera (The use of open diplomacy):** It calls for a ""broad debate and a requirement for a consensus on Middle East policy with US allies."" This is a form of open diplomacy.
* **D: Te whakatūnga o tētahi mahi whakawhanaunga hou (The establishment of a new engagement strategy):**  The report recommends a ""new strategy"" to be developed by the end of the year and rebuilding relationships between Sunni groups.



"
"E ai ki te pirihimana, ko wai i whakaarohia hei ringa matau o Provenzano?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""I kī te pirihimana i a Lo Piccolo te ringa haka i te mea ko ia te ringa katau o Provenzano i Palermo..."" which translates to ""The police said Lo Piccolo was the right hand man because he was Provenzano's lieutenant in Palermo...""

Therefore, according to the police, Lo Piccolo was considered Provenzano's lieutenant.



"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i homai i roto i te wāhanga, he aha te take o te matenga o Falcone?","The correct answer is **A: I patua a ia i te wā o te whawhai ā-Anaina**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...i whakamate ai i ngā hōia Mafia i a Giovanni Falcone me Paolo Borsellino i te 1992.""  This translates to ""...Provenzano ended the war of the Riina faction with the treaty that killed the Mafia soldiers Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992.""  This clearly indicates their deaths were a result of the Mafia conflict (""whawhai ā-Anaina"" - Mafia war/conflict).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: I patua a ia e nga pirihimana** - The passage doesn't mention police involvement in their deaths.
*   **C: I whakahaua a Lo Piccolo kia whakamatea ia** - While Lo Piccolo is mentioned as a key figure, the passage states Provenzano ended the conflict that *resulted* in their deaths, not that he directly ordered Lo Piccolo to kill them.
*   **D: I whakamatea ia e tētahi hoa rangatiratanga a Paolo Borsellino** - The passage says they were both killed in the same event, not that one killed the other.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā mea e whai ake nei ehara i te mea he whakamoemiti a Hitoshi Saito?,"The correct answer is **C: E rua nga wā o te toa koura o Orangirangi**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states Hitoshi Saito was a two-time Olympic medalist (toa o ngā mētara koura e rua), not a two-time Olympic champion (toa o te Ao).** It specifies medals, not outright wins.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: E rua nga wā o te Toa o te Ao (Two-time World Champion):** The passage explicitly mentions he was a former World Champion (toa o mua ki Ngā Taumāhekeheke o te Ao).
*   **B: manukura komiti whakangungu mō te Tōpūtanga o Tiapanī judo Katoa (Chairman of the All Japan Judo Federation Training Committee):** The passage states he was the chairman of this committee at the time of his death.
*   **D: tohunga Judo (Judo Expert):** Being a two-time Olympic medalist and a leader in the Judo federation clearly indicates he was a Judo expert.



"
I pēhea a Iwasaki i āhei ai ki te karo i te whakaari?,"The question asks how Iwasaki was able to avoid acting (presumably meaning performing a role or being forced to do something). The passage states Iwasaki was *imprisoned* in India (i mauheretia ki Īnia). This suggests India is where his troubles culminated and where he was prevented from doing something - likely continuing his journey or whatever ""acting"" refers to in this context.

Therefore, the answer is **C: Īnia**.

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hapani:** The passage doesn't mention anything about avoiding acting in Japan.
*   **B: Nepōra:** He was *attacked* at a marriage in Nepal, not avoiding something there.
*   **D: Tibet:** He was bitten by a rabid dog in Tibet, but that doesn't relate to avoiding acting.



"
Ko wai i whakaekea a Iwasaki?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngā Pirates** (The Pirates).

Here's why:

* **P:** states ""I pāhua ia e ngā kaiā moana"" - which translates to ""He was attacked by pirates."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tōna hoa tūpāpaku** (His funeral companion) - This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **C: He kuri** (A dog) - While he *was* bitten by a rabid dog, the text also states he was attacked by pirates. The primary attackers mentioned are pirates.
* **D: Pirihimana** (Police) - He was *arrested* in India, not attacked by police.



"
Nonahea a Alonso i mutu ai tana reihi?,"The correct answer is **A: Whai muri i te pakaru o Schumacher i tana wira o mua.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ko tana hoa ko Fernando Alonso i te ārahi i te reihi mō te nuinga, heoi i mutu whai muri i tana tau ki te taunga waka, akuanei pea i pēnei i te mea i raruraru te wīrā katau o mua.""  This translates to: ""His teammate Fernando Alonso led the race for most of it, but his race ended after his pit stop, apparently because his front right tire was damaged.""

Therefore, Alonso's race ended *after* Schumacher had a problem (and ultimately retired), but *because of* damage to his front tire during a pit stop. This makes option A the closest and most accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: I ngaro i a Fisichella te mana o tana motokā** - The text states Fisichella's race ended *at the beginning*, not related to Alonso.
*   **C: I muri i te whakamutunga o Schumacher i tōna ake rēhi** - While Schumacher did retire, Alonso's retirement was a separate incident.
*   **D: I mua i te ārahi** - Alonso was *leading* for most of the race, so his race didn't end *before* he led.



"
He aha te take i mutu wawe ai te whakataetae a Schumacher?,"The correct answer is **A: I ngaro i a ia te mana o tana motokā** (He lost power in his car).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kaore i roa i muri mai i a Alonso ka mutu te reihi a Michael Schumacher i te mea o ngā pakarūtanga ki te mihini i roto i ngā whawhai tini o te reihi.""  This translates to ""Not long after Alonso, Michael Schumacher's race ended due to mechanical failures in the engine during intense racing battles.""  ""Pakarūtanga ki te mihini"" directly refers to engine problems/loss of power.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: He tūtuki ki a Alonso** (He was beaten by Alonso) - While Alonso led for much of the race, Schumacher's retirement was due to a mechanical issue, not simply being overtaken.
*   **C: He tūkinotanga Wheel i takea mai i Fisichella** (A wheel collision caused by Fisichella) - The passage mentions Fisichella's retirement, but doesn't link it to Schumacher's.
*   **D: Tūkino ki te whakatārewatanga o te motokā** (Damage to the car's strategy) - The passage doesn't mention anything about strategy being the cause of Schumacher's retirement.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ma wai te mahi ki te whakatakoto putea mo te hunga mauheretia?","The correct answer is **A: Te āpiha hopu (The arresting officer)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ka whakarite kia rere te komihana, ki te āhei, ka whakamana ai i ngā whakapae i tūkuna e te āpiha hopu."" This translates to ""The commission will ensure it runs, if possible, and will validate the charges submitted by the *arresting officer*.""  

This means the arresting officer is responsible for submitting the charges that lead to setting bail (whakatakoto putea) for those arrested.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kaiwhakawa Glynn (Judge Glynn):** Judge Glynn ordered a detention hearing, but didn't *submit* the charges.
*   **C: Te pānga Pukapuka Matua (Central Booking):** Central Booking is where the arrests are processed, but they don't initiate the charges.
*   **D: Te komihana o te kōti (The court commission):** The court commission validates charges, they don't make them.



"
"E ai ki te ture ārai āwhinatanga e whakahuatia ana i roto i te wāhanga, he aha te mea e whakaaetia ana kia mau ki te hunga i hopukina kia roa ake i te 24 haora?","The correct answer is **C: Ngā utu kino i tukuna e te Kaiwhakawā Glynn** (The bail set by Judge Glynn).

Here's why:

The passage states that Judge Glynn issued a *bail order* ""to hold detainees longer than 24 hours following arrest, and before arraignment by a court commission.""  Bail is essentially a financial condition for release.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: utu (fee)** - While bail *involves* a fee, the passage specifically talks about a *bail order* set by a judge, not just any fee.
*   **B: He hui me te āpiha hopu (A meeting with the arresting officer)** - The passage doesn't mention any requirement for a meeting.
*   **D: He whakarongo (A hearing)** - The passage explicitly states the bail order is *before* arraignment (a hearing) by the court commission.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea te take kāore i whakamahia hei whakamārama i te whakahaerenga kua whakakorea?","The correct answer is **B: He whakahēnga mo te kaupapa ture**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nā ngā takawaenga kāwanatanga i kī kua pērā rawa te rangirua ki te ture kāwana o Āwhekenetāna kia whakatauria ai ehara i te mea waiwai te rerenga ake.""  This translates to ""Government intermediaries said the situation was similar to the governing law of Azerbaijan to determine that a rerun was not worthwhile.""  Essentially, they found a legal basis (similar to Azerbaijan's law) to justify *not* holding another election, arguing it wasn't legally sound to do so. This is a direct challenge/objection to the legal validity of holding another election.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā mōrea haumarutanga (Security concerns):** While security might be a factor in general, it isn't specifically mentioned as the reason in this excerpt.
*   **C: Ngā utu tiketike (High costs):** The passage mentions costs (""utu"") but not as the primary reason for not holding another election.
*   **D: Rangirua ā-kaupapa (Political stalemate):** While a stalemate *could* be implied, the text focuses on the *legal* justification provided by government intermediaries.



"
He aha te take i whakaarohia ai e ngā kaitōrangapū kāore he take o te putanga?,"The correct answer is **C: Tērā te rangirua i roto i te kaupapa ture**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nā ngā takawaenga kāwanatanga i kī kua pērā rawa te rangirua ki te ture kāwana o Āwhekenetāna kia whakatauria ai ehara i te mea waiwai te rerenga ake.""  This translates to ""Government intermediaries said the ambiguity was similar to the governing law of Afghanistan to determine that a recount was not worthwhile."" 

This directly indicates the reason the authorities considered a recount pointless was due to **ambiguity (rangirua) in the legal framework**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I haere ki te kaupapa ture (It went to the legal process):** While the issue *involved* the legal process, this isn't *why* they thought it was pointless.
*   **B: Tērā ētahi mōrea haumarutanga (There were some security concerns):** The passage doesn't mention security concerns.
*   **D: He nui rawa te utu o te pōti (The vote was too expensive):**  The passage mentions costs related to improving the Afghan system, but doesn't state the recount itself was too expensive.



"
Ko wai e whakarato ana i ngā ratonga whakawa mō FATA?,"The correct answer is **A: Te kāwanatanga o Pakistan**.

Here's why:

The text states that administrators are ""responsible for providing governmental and court services under Article 247 of the Pakistani Constitution."" This directly implies the Pakistani government is providing those services, including court/judicial services, to FATA.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ngā Māngai Tōrangapū (Judges):** While judges *deliver* the services, the text indicates the *government* is responsible for *providing* them.
*   **C: Perehitini o pakistan (President of Pakistan):** The President has authority over FATA, but the text doesn't say they directly provide the services. They delegate that to administrators.
*   **D: Te kāwanatanga o Ingarangi (The British government):** Sri Lanka gained independence from Britain in 1947, and the text is about Pakistan and FATA. Britain has no current role in providing services to FATA.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki “Ngā Māngai Tūturu” a FATA ehara i te tika?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka homai e rātau he ratonga whakawā (They provide judicial services)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the political agents are *failing* to deliver governmental and *court* services. This directly contradicts the statement that they *provide* judicial services.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: I tīpakohia rātau e te perehitini o Pakistan (They are appointed by the President of Pakistan):** The passage explicitly says the President of Pakistan has the authority to administer FATA and thus appoints these agents.
* **C: E piri ana rātau ki te kaupapa ture o pakistan (They are linked to the legal framework of Pakistan):**  They operate *under* Article 247 of the Pakistani Constitution.
* **D: Kua oti i a rātau te mana mo ētahi wāhi (They have authority over certain areas):** The passage states they are the primary authority in those areas.



"
He aha te tohu i tohua ai a Emma Stone?,"The correct answer is **C: Kaiwhakaari Tino Pai (Best Actress)**.

The passage states: ""Ko ētahi ingoa kē atu kua whakaurungia... a Gosling rāua ko Stone hei Best Actor me Best Actress."" This directly translates to Gosling and Stone being nominated for Best Actor and Best Actress."
Ko tehea te tohu kāore i tohua te kiriata?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngā Rākeitanga Arokite Tino Pai** (Best Cinematography).

The passage lists all the awards the movie *was* nominated for, and cinematography isn't among them. The other options (Best Picture, Best Original Song) are all mentioned as nominations. Therefore, B is the only one that wasn't.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei i mahi tonu i muri i te ruu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā pūrere katoa i te tipu Shika o Hokuriku** (All reactors at the Shika plant of Hokuriku).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""kua aukatia ngā pūrere Number 1 me te Number 2 ki tōna wāhi pūrere karihi Shika."" This means reactors Number 1 and 2 at the Shika plant were shut down, but *all* reactors continued to function normally (no impact on the reactor itself was reported).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Te taunga rererangi i Ishikawa** (The airport in Ishikawa) - The passage says the Noto Airport in Ishikawa is *closed*.
*   **C: Ratonga rerewhenua katoa** (All land transportation) - The passage says train services are *disrupted* in affected areas, not that all land transportation is still running.
*   **D: He tipu hiko i Niigata** (A power plant in Niigata) - The passage doesn't mention any power plant activity in Niigata, only power outages affecting homes.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā mea e whai ake nei i kino i te ruu?","The correct answer is **A: Ētahi kāinga (Some homes)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""kei te pūrongotia ko tōna 9400 ngā kāinga ki te takiwā kua kore wai, ā, tata ki te 100 kua kore hiko"" – which translates to ""it is reported that 9400 homes in the area are without water, and nearly 100 are without electricity."" This directly indicates homes have been affected.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: E rua ngā pūkaha i te pūkaha o Shika (Two reactors at the Shika plant)** - The passage states reactors 1 & 2 were shut down *as a precaution*, not that they were damaged.
*   **C: Ētahi huarahi (Some roads)** - While roads *are* damaged, the passage focuses on the impact to homes first.
*   **D: Te Taunga Rererangi o Noto (Noto Airport)** - The airport is *closed*, but the passage doesn't say it was damaged by the earthquake.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā take e whai ake nei kāore i whakaurua ki te tuhinga?","The correct answer is **A: Te wā heke mai o te Jerusalem (The future of Jerusalem)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses:**
    * **B: Te take o te pakanga o te tau 1967 (The cause of the 1967 war):**  It mentions the need for Palestinians to live in the territories before the 1967 Mideast War.
    * **C: Te aroaro o te hōia i te riu (The presence of troops in the area):**  It details Israel wanting a 10-year military presence and the PA wanting a 3-year presence.
    * **D: Te tautohetohe mo nga taitapa (Disputes over land):** The whole passage is *about* land disputes - settlements and the Jordan Valley.

* **The passage does *not* discuss:**
    * **A: Te wā heke mai o te Jerusalem (The future of Jerusalem):** Jerusalem is not mentioned at all in this excerpt.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te mea e hiahiatia ana e Palestine?,"The correct answer is **D: E rima tau te aroaro o te hōia i te Rawa o Jordan**.

Here's why:

The passage states Israel is requesting a ten-year military presence in the Jordan Valley, but the PA is only willing to agree to a three-year presence. Option D states a five-year presence, which *doesn't* align with either Palestine's (three years) or Israel's (ten years) requests. Therefore, it's something Palestine wouldn't be asking for.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā taitapa i runga anō i ngā here whawhai tōmua** (Negotiations based on pre-1967 war borders) - The passage explicitly mentions the need to discuss borders stemming from before the 1967 war, making this a Palestinian requirement.
*   **B: Kei te haere tonu nga hoia ki te Rawa o Jordan** (Continued military presence in the Jordan Valley) - The entire passage revolves around the length of this military presence, meaning it's a key point for Palestine.
*   **C: Ngā whakautu e pā ana ki te wā heke mai o te Jerusalem** (Responses relating to the future of Jerusalem) - The passage lists the future of Jerusalem as one of the issues being discussed, making it a Palestinian concern.



"
I whea whenua i ako ai a Ma i te ture?,"The correct answer is **A: United States of America**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ka ako ki Te whare Wānanga o New York me te Kura Ture o Harvard..."" ( ...studied at New York University and Harvard Law School...). Both of these institutions are in the United States of America.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Haina (China)** - While the passage mentions a desire to strengthen ties with China, it doesn't say Ma studied law *in* China.
*   **C: Ahitereiria (Australia)** - The passage doesn't mention Australia at all.
*   **D: Hong Kong** - The passage states Ma was *born* in Hong Kong, not that they studied law there.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko te tautoko i tehea whenua i āwhina i te wikitōria o Ma?","The correct answer is **D: Haina**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...i toa i a Ma i runga i te whakaaro hei hāpai ake kia tata ake ngā hononga ki te whenua matua o Hāina.""  This translates to ""...Ma won on the idea of raising to bring closer ties with the motherland of China."" 

This clearly indicates that a platform of strengthening relations with China helped Ma win.



"
"E ai ki te kōrero i roto i te wāhanga, ko wai i mahi ai a Carolyn Wilson i mua i tana wehe atu i te taone?","The correct answer is **C: Te OHA**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...kua tāhae a Carolyn Wilson nō te OHA i ā rātou utu whakahaumaru, me te wehe tonu atu i te tāone."" This translates to ""...Carolyn Wilson of the OHA stole their security deposits and then left town.""

Therefore, Carolyn Wilson worked for **Te OHA** before leaving town.



"
"Me ngā iwi e whā e toe ana i te wā, ko wai kai te wāhi tuawhā o te Whakataetae Atekōkiri?","The correct answer is **B: Kahne**.

Here's how we know:

The text states: ""Kei te tuarima a Kahne..."" which translates to ""Kahne is in fifth place...""  It also states that Hamlin is third, and Bowyer is behind Hamlin. Since there are only four races left, and we know the positions of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th, Kahne *must* be in fourth place.



"
"Whai muri i te whakataetae i whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga, e hia ngā tohu a Kahne i te Pirimia Kaiwhakahaere?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The passage states: ""Kei te tuarima a Kahne, kei te tuaono a Truex, Jr., ā, me ngā piro e 2,220 me te 2,207."" This directly translates to ""Kahne is fifth, Truex, Jr. is sixth, with 2,220 and 2,207 points respectively."" Therefore, Kahne has 2220 points."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, e hia nga wā i kite ai te tangata i te takanga o nga matakōkiri e kitea ana he take o te martian ā muri ake?","The correct answer is **C: Tekau mā rima nga wā** (Fifteen times).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tekau mā rima o ēnei toka kua tohua nā te rerenga matakōkiri i tērā Hōngongoi.""  This translates to ""Fifteen of these stones were identified by the meteor fall last June.""  The passage directly links the identification of these stones (presumably Martian in origin, as the question implies) to observed meteor falls – therefore, fifteen times people have witnessed the fall of meteorites identified as coming from Mars.



"
"Ka rite ki te mea i whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga, he aha te pono o nga toka kua kitea he Martian te takenga mai?","The correct answer is **D: E 34 o rātau** (There are 34 of them).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mai i te tata ki te 24,000 matakōkiri e mōhiotia ana kua hinga ki te Ao, tōna 34 anake kua whakatūturutia te ahunga mai i Matawhero.""  This translates to: ""Of the nearly 24,000 meteorites known to have fallen to Earth, only 34 have been confirmed to originate from Mars.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I kitea katoa rātou i te wā o te ua meteorite o Hōngongoi** (They were all found during the November meteorite shower) - While 15 were identified *after* a November shower, not all 34 were found then.
*   **B: E 24,000 o rātau** (There are 24,000 of them) - This refers to the *total* number of meteorites found on Earth, not just the Martian ones.
*   **C: E wātea ana rātau ki te $11,000 neke atu i te koura** (They are available for $11,000 over gold) - This refers to the price, not the *number* of Martian meteorites.



"
No hea i haere ai a Schumacher?,"The correct answer is **C: I muri i te whakakapi i a Felipe Massa** (After replacing Felipe Massa).

Here's why:

The text states: ""P: I rite ki te whakakapi i a Felipe Massa kua whara, a Schumacher..."" which translates to ""P: To replace the injured Felipe Massa, Schumacher..."". This directly indicates Schumacher came in *after* replacing Massa.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I muri i te hinga o Felipe Massa** (After Felipe Massa's accident) - While his accident *led* to the replacement, it doesn't explain where Schumacher came *from*.
*   **B: I muri i tana toa whitu o tana whakataetae** (After his seventh win of the competition) - The text mentions his seven championships but doesn't relate it to *why* he was replacing Massa.
*   **D: I te mutunga o te wā 2009** (At the end of the 2009 season) - The text doesn't state Schumacher's arrival was at the end of the season, but immediately after Massa's injury.



"
No hea i whara ai a Massa?,"The correct answer is **A: I te wa o te Grand Prix**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...kua pāngia te tangata no Parihi e tētahi whara upoko tino kino whai muri i tētahi tukituki i te Hungarian Grand Prix i te tau 2009."" This translates to ""...the Brazilian was affected by a very serious head injury following a collision at the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2009.""

Therefore, Massa was injured *during* a Grand Prix.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: I muri i te whiwhinga i te whakataetae Tātai 1** - The text doesn't mention anything about a qualifying race.
*   **C: I mua i te whakatānga o Schumacher** - While the text mentions Schumacher, it doesn't say Massa's injury happened before Schumacher's retirement.
*   **D: I mua i te wā 2009** - The text specifically states the injury happened *in* 2009."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, me pēhea te pānga o te whakaritenga ki AOL?","The correct answer is **A: Ka nui ake pea te maha o ngā kaiwhakamahi o AOL**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te tau o ngā kaiwhakamahi o ngā ratonga Yahoo! me Microsoft hui tahi ka tāwhai i te tau o ngā kiritaki a AOL."" This translates to ""The number of users of Yahoo! and Microsoft services combined will likely surpass the number of AOL customers.""  

This means AOL *could gain* more users as a result of this situation (the combined user base of Yahoo! and Microsoft being larger).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ko AOL anake te kamupene i hangaia te mākete IM** - The passage doesn't claim AOL was the sole creator of the IM market.
* **C: Ka whakataetae te maha o ngā kaiwhakamahi o AOL ki ngā kaiwhakamahi o Yahoo me Microsoft** -  The passage suggests the *combined* Yahoo/Microsoft user base will be larger, not that AOL's users will compete with them individually.
* **D: Kua kore te AOL e whakamahia i Te Hononga o Amerika** - The passage mentions AOL's success *in* the United States (""Ngā Whenua Tōpū o Amerika""), not that it's stopped using it.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ka mutu i muri i te whakaritenga hou?,"The correct answer is **C: Te herekore o AOL ki te whakawhanake i te mākete i tōna ake tere** (AOL's freedom to develop the market at its own pace).

Here's why:

The passage states ""...I te noho mai o tēnei whakaritenga, ka oti pea tēnei herekorenga."" (Once this condition is met, this freedom may be completed).  This directly links the new arrangement (presumably a deal or change in circumstances) to AOL gaining more control over its market development.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Te whanaketanga whānui o te Ipurangi i te United States** (The general development of the Internet in the United States) - The passage doesn't suggest this will *result* from the arrangement, just that AOL's initial success was tied to the US.
* **B: Te whakamahinga o te mākete IM** (The use of the IM market) - The passage talks about AOL's development *of* the IM market, not its use.
* **D: Ko te hononga a Yahoo me Microsoft** (The connection between Yahoo and Microsoft) -  While mentioned as a comparison point (their combined users), the arrangement isn't about their connection.



"
E hia ngā tāngata i mate i te whakaeke ehara i te pirihimana?,"The correct answer is **C: 0**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Ka mate ngā pirihimana e rua"" (Two police officers died). It also says ""he tekau mā iwa o te hunga i whara he pirihimana"" (nineteen of the wounded were police officers).  This means all those who died and were wounded were police officers - therefore, zero civilians/non-police died in the attack.



"
Na wai i pūrongo te whakapae i te whakaeke?,"The correct answer is **A: Pirihimana**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""E whakapae ana ngā pirihimana ko te tangata tūkino he hōia Daesh (ISIL).""  This directly translates to ""Police accuse the attacker of being a Daesh (ISIL) soldier."" 

Therefore, the police reported the accusation.



"
"Nā te tūnga o Florida hei kāwanatanga toa-ka tango-katoa, he aha te mea i whakawhiwhia ki a Mitt Romney?","The correct answer is **B: Te whakaingoatanga a te Republican Party**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""...ka whakawhiwhia ngā pōti katoa ki a Romney i kake ake rā ia ki te tauwhāinga toa mō te pāti o ngā Manapori."" This translates to ""...all the votes were awarded to Romney as he moved closer to the nomination for the Republican party.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 32 o ngā māngai o te kāwanatanga** - Newt Gingrich received 32% of the vote, not Romney.
*   **C: Ngā kaitautapa katoa o te kāwanatanga** - This isn't what Romney received; he received the votes that *contributed* to the nomination.
*   **D: 46 ōrau o te pōti** - While Romney *received* 46% of the vote, the question asks what he was *awarded* due to Florida being a ""winner-take-all"" state. He was awarded the party nomination progress.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te ōrau o ngā pōti i whiwhi a Gingrich i te pōtitanga tuatahi?","The correct answer is **B: 32 ōrau**.

The text states: ""I tuarua mai te Kaikōrero o te Whare o Ngā Whenua Tōpū o Amerika o mua a Newt Gingrich, ki te 32 ōrau."" which translates to ""Newt Gingrich came in second with 32 percent.""



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko wai kāore i haere tonu i muri i ngā hua o te hui?","The correct answer is **B: Bachmann**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I whakatau a Bachmana, nāna i toa ki te Ames Straw Poll i Here-turi-kōkā, ki te whakaoti i tana whawhai."" This directly translates to ""Bachmann, who won the Ames Straw Poll in August, decided to end her fight.""  This means she *did not* continue after the results of the caucus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gingrich:** The text says Gingrich initially courted Santorum but then criticized Romney, and continued in the race.
*   **C: Perry:** Perry initially considered leaving (""hoki atu ki Texas..."") but then decided to stay and compete.
*   **D: Romney:** The passage doesn't state Romney considered leaving the race.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nāna i kōrero nui tētahi atu kaitono i muri i te hua o te kararehe?","The correct answer is **B: Gingrich**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ka īnoi a Gingrich ki a Santorum, engari ka whakatāmaramara ki a Romney nā wai ngā mahi whakatairanga hē i tuku kia whakaatuhia ki Iowa mō Gingrich.""  This translates to ""...Gingrich attacked Santorum, but reprimanded Romney for letting damaging campaign materials be shown in Iowa about Gingrich.""

This clearly indicates Gingrich was critical of Romney after the results came in, essentially blaming Romney for negative campaigning. The question asks who ""talked a lot to another candidate after the outcome of the caucus,"" and Gingrich's reprimand of Romney fits this description.



"
I hea te wāhi anake i whakaatuhia ai te whakaaturanga i mua i te tau 2015?,"The correct answer is **A: Reo Irirangi TogiNet**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I ōna rā tīmatanga, i whakaaturia anake te hōtaka ki te pae tukutuku reo irirangi ā-ipurangi kua roa e tū ana a TogiNet Radio...""  This translates to ""In its early days, the show was only broadcast on the long-standing online radio website TogiNet Radio...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Te Rāwhiti o Te Rāwhiti (East Texas):** While the show *eventually* reached listeners in East Texas, it wasn't where it was *originally* broadcast.
* **C: Reo Irirangi AstroNet:** AstroNet Radio wasn't launched until the end of 2015, so it couldn't have been the original broadcast location.
* **D: Ngā pou reo irirangi paetata (Local radio stations):** The passage doesn't mention anything about the show being broadcast on local radio stations.



"
He aha te āhua o te whakaahuatanga a te teihana i te whakaaturanga?,"The correct answer is **A: Amateur**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the station's presentation as """"whakaari ā-reo irirangi o mua me te āhuatanga hou, kino te pakihawa!"""".  This translates to ""old-fashioned radio broadcasting with a new feature, bad atmosphere!"".  ""Kino te pakihawa"" specifically implies a low-quality, unprofessional feel. ""Amateur"" best captures that sense of being unpolished and not highly professional.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Geeky** - While it's a radio station and might appeal to enthusiasts, the description doesn’t suggest a 'geeky' vibe.
*   **C: kura tawhito** - ""Old-fashioned"" is part of the description, but doesn't capture the negative connotation of poor quality.
*   **D: Paetata** - This translates to 'simple' or 'basic' and doesn’t necessarily imply low quality or a bad atmosphere.



"
He aha te mea i kohia e David Headley i āwhina i te whakaeke a te rōpū hōia?,"The correct answer is **A: Mōhiohio (Information)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko tā David Headley mahi pūraohua me te nanao ki ngā kōiriiritanga i āwhina ai kia whakarite i te mahinga...""  This translates to ""David Headley's reconnaissance and focus on investigations helped to plan the attack...""  Reconnaissance means gathering information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Pohū (Bombs)** - While bombs were *used* in the attack, Headley didn't *provide* them.
*   **C: Ngā Pūtā (Boats)** - The boats were the *method of transport*, not something Headley supplied.
*   **D: Ngā rākau aunoa (Automatic weapons)** - Similar to boats, the weapons were used, but Headley's contribution was in the planning stages through information gathering.



"
He aha te momo waka i whakamahia e te rōpū hoariri ki te haere ki Mumbai?,"The correct answer is **B: Mahere**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""I ahu mai ngā kai patu Mumbai mā runga **poti** i te 26 o Noema 2008...""  ""Poti"" translates to ""boat"" or ""vessel"", which is best represented by ""Mahere"" in the options provided. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rerewhenua** - means airplane
*   **C: Waka** - is a general term for vehicle, but ""poti"" is more specific.
*   **D: Kā** - means car



"
Ko tēhea kōrero e whakaatu tika ana i te putanga o te whakataetae Nadal me Raonic's Brisbane Open i whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga?,"The correct answer is **A: I patua e Raonic a Nadal**.

Here's why:

* The passage states ""Nō nā tata nei ia hinga ai ki a Raonic i te Brisbane Open.""  ""Hinga"" means to fall or be defeated. Therefore, Raonic defeated Nadal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He 88% ngā tohu pūtea a Raonic** - The passage states Nadal won 88% of his points, not Raonic.
* **C: I patua e Nadal a Raonic** - The passage explicitly states Nadal *lost* to Raonic.
* **D: E 76 ngā piro i piro ai a Raonic** - The passage says Nadal won 76 points on his first serve, not Raonic.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te tūnga o te whakataetae a Nadal rāua ko Raonic i muri i te tūnga tuatahi?","The correct answer is **D: I patua e Raonic a Nadal**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Nō nā tata nei ia hinga ai ki a Raonic i te Brisbane Open."" This translates to ""He recently lost to Raonic at the Brisbane Open.""  ""Hinga"" means to fall or lose.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He 88% ngā tohu pūtea a Raonic** - The passage says Nadal won 88% of his points, not Raonic.
*   **B: I riro a Nadal i ngā tohu 76** - While true, this doesn't answer the question about the *result* of the match against Raonic.
*   **C: Ko te tapeke ko te 7-2** - This refers to Nadal's head-to-head record *generally* against Canadian opponents, not the specific match with Raonic.



"
Ko tehea te hōtaka reo kāore i whakaurua ki ngā whakaaturanga hou e toru o Naked News?,"The correct answer is **A: Reo Itāria**.

Here's why:

The passage states Naked News is expanding into Spanish, Italian, and Korean languages. It *already* reports in English and Japanese. Therefore, Italian is the language being added to the new broadcasts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Reo Kōria** - The passage explicitly mentions Korean as one of the new languages.
*   **C: Reo Hapanihi** - The passage states they already report in Japanese.
*   **D: Reo Pāniora** - The passage explicitly mentions Spanish as one of the new languages.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, kei whea te wāhi e wātea ai ngā whakaaturanga hou o Naked News?","The correct answer is **B: Te Ipurangi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kei te whakarewahia e ngā kaiwhakahaere o te ao whānui i ngā kaupapa reo Pāniora, Itāria me Korea hoki mō te **pouaka whakaata, te ipurangi** me ngā waea pūkoro."" 

This translates to ""...global managers are launching projects in Spanish, Italian and Korean for television, **the internet**, and mobile phones.""

While the options A & D are also mentioned, the question asks *where* the new showings will be available, and the internet is explicitly stated as one of those places.



"
E hia ngā kaiwhakataetae kāore i oti i te Giant Slalom?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

The passage states: ""Tokowhā ngā kaieke retireti ki te rōpū noho ā-wāhine kāore i oti ō rātou rerenga, ā, 45 mai i te 117 kaieke retireti katoa ki te Giant Slalom kāore i whiwhi piro ki te rēhi.""  This translates to ""Four riders in the women's group did not complete their runs, and 45 out of 117 riders overall in the Giant Slalom did not finish the race.""

Therefore, 45 riders did not finish the Giant Slalom."
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e whakaatu tika ana i ngā hua o ngā whakataetae i ngā whakataetae?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **B: E 45 nga reti kāore i whakaoti i a rātau whakahaere i roto i te Giant Slalom**. 

He tika tenei na te mea i kōrero te tuhinga, ""Tokowhā ngā kaieke retireti ki te rōpū noho ā-wāhine kāore i oti ō rātou rerenga, ā, 45 mai i te 117 kaieke retireti katoa ki te Giant Slalom kāore i whiwhi piro ki te rēhi.""

E tirohia he aha te hē i ētahi atu whakautu:

*   **A:** He hē. I oti tekau a Carpenado, kāore i mutu i mua i te kaieke mai i Hungary.
*   **C:** He hē. E 116 kaiwhakataetae i uru ki te Slalom, e 117 ki te Giant Slalom. Kaore i kōrero te tuhinga mo te maha o te reti i oti i ia whakataetae.
*   **D:** He hē. Ka whakawhiwhia ki a Carpenado te Kāore i Oti i tana rerenga tuatahi i te Slalom."
Ko tēhea o ēnei mea i whakatauhia e te NBA kia whakamutua?,"The correct answer is **A: Te wā poikohu** (The basketball season).

Here's why:

The passage states the NBA *suspended the season* (""i rāhuitia te kaupeka poitūkohu"") due to COVID-19 concerns. The suspension was triggered by a player on the Utah Jazz testing positive, but the action taken was to halt the entire season.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He kaitākaro no te Utah Jazz** (A player from the Utah Jazz) - While a player *caused* the suspension, they weren't what was suspended.
* **C: Tētahi pūpāpāho i whakamātauria pai mō COVID-19** (A player who tested positive for COVID-19) -  Similar to B, this is the *reason* for the suspension, not the suspension itself.
* **D: Te tīma poikohu o Utah Jazz** (The Utah Jazz basketball team) - The team wasn't suspended, the whole league/season was.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te take i āwangawanga ai te NBA mō te huaketo?","The correct answer is **C: I muri i te whakamātautau i te pai, ka whakamōhiotia tētahi kaitākaro mō te Utah Jazz i muri i te whakamātautau i te pai.**

Here's why:

The passage states the NBA suspended the season *following* a Utah Jazz player testing positive for COVID-19.  Option C directly reflects this – a Utah Jazz player was *notified* (meaning they tested positive) after testing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't say NBA members were testing well; it says one tested *positive*.
*   **B:** The passage doesn't mention multiple players testing positive, just one.
*   **D:** While true, it doesn't explain *why* the NBA was concerned. The concern arose *after* the positive test, leading to the suspension.



"
Ko wai i eke i te whāinga toa mō ngā Washington Capitals i te kēmu ki ngā Atlanta Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **D: Alex Ovechkin**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Ko te āwhina tuatahi a Ovechkin mō te pō ko tana āwhina ki te whai i te piro i toa ai, nā te tore-kai-huruhuru nā Nicklas Backstrom;"" which translates to ""Ovechkin's first assist of the night was his assist to follow up on the game-winning goal, scored by Nicklas Backstrom."" This means Backstrom *scored* the winning goal, but Ovechkin assisted it.

The text also explicitly states Ovechkin scored 2 goals in the game. Therefore, he was a key player in the victory, and while Backstrom scored the winning goal, the question asks who scored for the Washington Capitals, and Ovechkin did.



"
Ko wai i eke i tana whāinga 60 o te wā i te wā o Capitals vs. Ko te kēmu o ngā Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The text states: ""Ko tāna kōrā tuarua o te pō ko tana tua 60 o te kaupeka..."" (His second goal of the night was his 60th of the season...) This directly answers the question. The text also mentions Jaromir Jagr and Mario Lemieux *previously* achieved this, but Ovechkin is the one who did it in *this* game.



"
Nō whea i hiahiatia ai e te pēke o Northern Rock te tautoko a te kāwanatanga?,"The correct answer is **A: I muri i te whakawāteatanga o te pēke** (After the collapse of the bank).

Here's why:

The text states: ""I hiahia āwhina a Northern Rock i te mea o tana tū marake i te wā o te mōrearea mōkete āpiti i te tau 2007."" This translates to ""Northern Rock needed help because of its position during the global credit crunch in 2007,"" which led to its collapse and subsequent government support in 2008.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The split into ""good bank"" and ""bad bank"" happened *after* the government takeover.
* **C & D:** Virgin purchased the ""good bank"" *after* the government takeover, not *before* Northern Rock needed support.  Also, the text says Virgin, not Puhi.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e whakaahua tika ana i ngā mahi a Virgin Group ki te pēke Northern Rock?","The correct answer is **B: I hokona e te rōpū Virgin Group te pēke i muri i tōna whakaraunga.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I whakaparahakongia tētahi tono mō te pēke a te Virgin Group a Sir Richard Branson i mua i te whakawhānuitanga ki te motu o taua pēke."" (A bid for the bank by the Virgin Group of Sir Richard Branson was made before the expansion of that bank). And later, ""Kua hokona e Virgin te """"pēke pai"""" o Northern rock"" (Virgin bought the ""good bank"" of Northern Rock).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I hokona hoki e Virgin Group te kamupene whakahaere rawa o Northern Rock** - The passage explicitly states Virgin *did not* buy the asset management company (""kaua ko te kamupene whakahaere rawa"").
*   **C: I whakawhiwhia e Virgin Group te tautoko ohorere ki te pēke i te wā o te raru nama** - While Virgin made a bid, the passage doesn't mention offering emergency support.
*   **D: Ko te tono tuatahi a Virgin Group mō te pēke i mahia i muri i te whakakotahitanga o te pēke** - The passage states the bid was made *before* the expansion (""i mua i te whakawhānuitanga"").



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga, he aha te iwi e pāngia ana e te hainatanga o te kirimana āhuarangi o Kyoto?","The correct answer is **A: United States**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that the United States is the *only developed country* that has not ratified the Kyoto accord. The question asks which nation is affected by the decision to sign the Kyoto climate accord, and the passage highlights the US as being in a unique position regarding it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Īnia (India)** - The passage states India was *not* covered by the emissions goals.
*   **C: Ahitereiria (Australia)** - The passage mentions Australia *rejected* ratifying Kyoto, but it's already been rejected, so it's not *affected* by a decision to sign.
*   **D: Haina (China)** - Similar to India, China was *not* covered by the emissions goals.



"
I whakaaro te kāwanatanga o Australia o mua ka kino te whakaaetanga o Kyoto ki te aha?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngā kawenga ake waro** (Australia's own coal exports).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kaunihera ō mua o Ahitereiria i whakakahore kia whakamana i a Kyoto, me te kī ake ka pakaru te ohanga me tana tīno whakawhirinaki ki te kaweake waro...""  This directly translates to ""the former Australian council rejected ratifying Kyoto, saying it would damage the economy and its reliance on coal exports.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te United States** - While the US is mentioned as the only other developed country not to ratify Kyoto, the passage focuses on *Australia's* reasoning.
*   **B: Te āhua o te whenua** - The nature of the land isn't mentioned as a concern.
*   **D: Ngā ūnga harakoa o te whenua** - The land's financial holdings aren't specifically mentioned as a concern.



"
He aha te hōtaka i whakawhiwhia ai ngā kaiwhakatū i te ara?,"The correct answer is **A: Ko te kaupapa Sporting Shooters Association o Australia** (The Sporting Shooters Association of Australia program).

The text states: ""...ki raro i te hōtaka aruaru o te Sporting Shooters Association."" (…under the training program of the Sporting Shooters Association.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Te papatono Atawhai Papa me te Tuku iho** - This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **C: Te papatono NPWS** - While NPWS is involved, the training was *under* the Sporting Shooters Association program.
* **D: Ko te hōtaka hopu a te Association of Sporting Shooters** - The text says it's a *training* program, not a trapping (hopu) program.



"
Ko tēhea kōrero e kore e tika te whakaatu i te whakamātautau whakahaere kino?,"The correct answer is **A: Pērā ki te whakamātautau tuatahi o te papatono, kāore i arotakea.** (Like the initial firearms test, it wasn't reviewed.)

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on *improved* testing and evaluation.** The whole point is that the forest workers are now administering and assessing the competency tests themselves. The passage states they are evaluating the *quality* of the testing. Saying the test wasn't reviewed implies a lack of quality control, which is the opposite of what the passage describes.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

* **B: I whiwhi tohutohu whakangungu ngā tākaro** (The shooters received training) - The passage explicitly states the four operators were trained in safety and firearms handling.
* **C: I whakahaeretia nga pūtiro e nga kaitiaki** (The firearms were administered by the workers) - The passage states the forest workers administer the firearms tests.
* **D: E whā ngā pūtiro i tīpakohia** (Four firearms were selected) - The passage mentions four operators were chosen. This implies four firearms were involved in the testing process.



Therefore, option A is the statement that doesn’t align with the passage’s message of *improved* testing procedures."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i kitea te wahi?","The correct answer is **D: I Etiopia**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""...te kōrero a te kairangahau ki te Rift Valley Research Service **ki Etiopia**..."" which directly translates to ""...the researcher spoke to the Rift Valley Research Service **in Ethiopia**...""

While the research *is* related to the Rift Valley (making A tempting), the passage specifically states the researcher was *in* Ethiopia.  The other options (B & C) aren't directly mentioned as locations where the discovery was made.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea i tupu wawe ake i te mea i whakaarohia?","The correct answer is **A: Te kitenga o te fossil** (The discovery of the fossil).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...i mōhio ai i moata ke noa ake o te wehenga nui, tēnā i tā rātou i whakatau ai mā te **kitenga rāpoi ngota**.""  This translates to ""...they realized the split was much earlier than previously thought, thanks to their determination through the **fossil discovery**.""

The passage directly links the earlier dating of the split to the finding of the fossil. The other options are mentioned in the context of the research, but are not what happened *sooner* than expected.



"
He aha te mea e hiahiatia ana e te kaitākaro kia taea ai e ia te whakahaere i ngā nekehanga i te wā o te kēmu ataata?,"The correct answer is **B: Triangulate to rātau tūnga**.

Here's why:

The passage states the system uses two sensors positioned near the TV to ""triangulate"" the player's position in 3D space. This triangulation is *how* the controller determines movement within the game.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tirohia mēnā kei te whakaturia ngā pūoko o te kaiwhakahaere i te taha o te papatohu** - This translates to ""Check if the controller's knobs are on the side of the screen"". This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Purua ngā pūoko ki te taha o tō rātou pouaka whakaata** - This translates to ""Point the knobs towards your TV"". This doesn't relate to the described technology.
*   **D: Nekehia te pūmana mā te hau** - This translates to ""Move the controller by wind"". This is unrelated to the described system.



"
He aha te mea i hangaia kia rite ki te taura pouaka whakaata?,"The correct answer is **B: Ko te kaiwhakahaere Nintendo Revolution**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He āhua ōrite te hanga ki tētahi roumamao, ā, e whakamahi ana te kaiwhakahaere i ngā paerongo e rua e whakatakotoria ana tata ki te pouaka whakaata a te kaimahi..."" This translates to: ""It was built to resemble a remote control, and the controller uses two sensors placed near the employee's television to track its position in three-dimensional space.""  

Therefore, the controller (which was for the Nintendo Revolution - later the Wii) was designed to *resemble* a remote control.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā pūoko e rua o te pūmana** (The two buttons of the controller) - The passage mentions sensors, not buttons.
*   **C: Te whakaaturanga matua** (The main presentation) - This refers to the Tokyo Game Show presentation, not something designed like a remote.
*   **D: Te papatohu Revolution Nintendo** (The Nintendo Revolution brochure) -  This is irrelevant to the description of the controller's design."
He aha te mea kihai i whakaaturia i roto i te pūrongo hou a te tari rongo o Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **B: I tau te waka rererangi ki Ürümqi**.

Here's why:

The passage states the flight was *denied* permission to land in Ürümqi. This means the new report from Xinhua *didn't* state that the plane landed there. The other options *are* mentioned in the report:

* **A:** The report states a bomb threat was made to the plane.
* **C:** The report states the plane was diverted to Afghanistan.
* **D:** The report states the plane landed in Kandahar.

Therefore, the only thing *not* reported by Xinhua is the plane landing in Ürümqi.



"
He aha kāore i kōrerotia i roto i te pūrongo tuatahi o te kōwhiringa hou o Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **B: I whakakorea te waka rererangi i tētahi tauranga ohorere** (The plane was diverted to an unexpected airport).

Here's why:

* **The first report from Xinhua only stated the plane was hijacked.** The passage explicitly says ""I mua tata nei i rīpoatangia e te kaiwhakahaere kawepūrongo Hainamana, e Xinhua te kāhaki o tētahi waka rererangi"" (Initially reported by the Chinese news agency, Xinhua, the hijacking of an aircraft).
* The subsequent reports revealed the diversion to Afghanistan after being denied landing in Urumqi. This information *wasn't* in the initial report.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I kahakina te waka rererangi** (The plane was hijacked) - This *was* mentioned in the first report.
* **C: I whakahokia te waka rererangi ki Afghanistan** (The plane was returned to Afghanistan) - This is a result of the diversion, not the initial report.
* **D: I whiwhi te waka rererangi i tētahi tuma pōma** (The plane received a bomb threat) - This detail comes from *later* reports, not the first.



"
He aha te mea i panuitia e Sara Danius i te hōtaka reo irirangi?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka mutu te mahi a te komiti ki te whakapā atu ki a Bob Dylan.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kua whakarere i āna mahi ki te pā atu ki a ia."" ( ""...has given up trying to reach him."") This directly translates to the committee stopping their efforts to contact Bob Dylan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ko te toa o te Tohu Nobel i roto i te Pukapuka** - While the passage *relates* to the Nobel Prize, Danius wasn't announcing the winner, but rather the difficulty in contacting the winner.
* **B: Karekau he whakautu a te komiti mai i nga hoa mahi** - The passage says they *received* a response, albeit a ""highly artistic"" one.
* **C: Ko ngā kaitono mō te Tohu Nobel i te Pukapuka 2016** - The passage is about contacting the *winner*, not the applicants.



"
Ko wai kāore i taea te tae atu?,"The correct answer is **D: Bob Dylan**.

The passage explicitly states the Nobel Committee for Literature was unable to reach Bob Dylan (""kāore i te āhei ki te whakapā tōtika atu ki a Bob Dylan""). 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kaiwehe tata a Bob Dylan** - This translates to ""Bob Dylan's close representative."" The passage says they *received* a response, so they *were* reached.
* **B: Sara Danius** - Sara Danius is the one *doing* the reaching out, not the one being unreachable.
* **C: Te Wāhanga o Huitene** - This refers to Huitene, where the announcement was made, not someone who was trying to contact Dylan.



"
"""Ko wai i kōrero mo te taunaha he """"hipanga nui""""?""","The correct answer is **C: Kōnata Johndroe**.

The text explicitly states: ""ka kī ake te māngai a Bush, ko Gordon Johndroe, """"he āhuatanga nui tēnei ki te whakatutuki i te whakatūturutanga o te pāpurupuru-kore ki runga o te kūrae o Korea."""" "" 

This translates to ""Bush's spokesperson, Gordon Johndroe, said """"this is a significant step towards achieving the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula."""" "" Therefore, Johndroe is the one who called it a ""significant step"".



"
E hia ngā tīkitipati i hangaia e Słania mō ngā whenua rerekē?,"The correct answer is **C: Tata ki te 2,000**.

Here's why:

The text states Słania created 1,000 queen's plates for Sweden and *approximately 28* for other countries.  1,000 + 28 = 1,028, which rounds to ""Tata ki te 2,000"" (close to 2,000).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Neke atu i te 2,000** - The text doesn't indicate more than 2,000.
*   **B: 1000** - This only accounts for the plates made for Sweden, not the others.
*   **D: Neke atu i te 1,000** - While true, ""Tata ki te 2,000"" is a more accurate reflection of the information given.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te take o te māturu haere tonu i nga haora o te kura?","The correct answer is **C: Whakanui wera (Increased temperature)**.

The passage states: ""Ko tētahi wāhi pupuri tuarua ki raro i ngā kura e āhei ana te pupuri i te 104,500 kāho kāore anō kia whakakīia katoatia."" and ""I te ata o te Wenerei, i te komama tonu ngā putanga kura ko te take pea ko te whakarahi ā-mahana ki roto i te kura."" This directly translates to ""A secondary containment area below the spill pads is able to hold 104,500 barrels that have not yet been recovered."" and ""On Wednesday morning, officials still suspect the cause may be temperature increases into the pad.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kei te whakakiia te wāhi ārai tuarua ki te kaha (The secondary containment area is being filled):** While the area *can* hold more oil, the passage states they are investigating the *cause* of the continued leakage, not that the containment area is filling up.
*   **B: He whakamātautau auau o te pūnaha whakahau ahi (Routine testing of the fire suppression system):** The passage mentions a fire suppression system test *preceded* the leak, but doesn't connect it to the *continued* leakage.
*   **D: He ahi i tētahi o ngā pou mapu o Pā Greely (A fire at one of the Fort Greely pump stations):** The passage doesn’t mention a fire at Fort Greely beyond the initial pressure surge.



"
He aha i tuwhera ai nga whatanga āwhina?,"The correct answer is **B: I puta he mate hiko i muri i te whakamātautau pūnaha**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Nā te ngoikore o te hiko whai muri i te whakamātau i te pūnaha-ā-ahi, ka huaki ake ngā pēhanga āwhina..."" This translates to ""Due to the power failure following the system test, the relief valves opened..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tērā te whakawhānuitanga wera i roto i nga reheke** (That was thermal expansion in the pipes) - While the text mentions temperature increases as a *possible* cause of the spill *after* the valves opened, it wasn't the reason the valves opened in the first place.
*   **C: I tino kaha nga reheke** (The pipes were very strong) - The text doesn't indicate pipe strength as a factor.
*   **D: Kāore i taea e te wāhi ārai tuarua te pupuri i ngā pere e ranea ana** (The secondary containment area couldn't hold the spilled oil) - The secondary containment area is mentioned as a place to *catch* the oil *after* it spilled, not as the cause of the spill.



"
"I tēnei wā, he pēhea te teitei o te wai i te Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **C: He hope-teitei**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kei te noho ki raro i te wai he hope te teitei i te ekenga o te maioro oneone tata.""  This translates to ""The Ninth Ward is under water at a height *lower* than the level of the nearby earthen levee.""  It doesn't give a specific height, just that it's below the levee's height.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 20 waewae (20 feet)** - This was the height during Hurricane Katrina, not the current situation.
*   **B: 6 īnihi (6 inches)** - This refers to the potential breach size, not the water level.
*   **D: 100 waewae (100 feet)** - This is the width of the affected area, not the water height.



"
"I te wā o te Hurricane Katrina, he aha te mea i puta i te Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **C: E 20 waewae te teitei o nga wai waipuke** (The floodwaters were 20 feet high).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ko te Ninth Ward, i reira i waipuketia tae atu ki te 20 putu te teitei i te wā o Hurricane Katrina..."" which translates to ""The Ninth Ward, where it was flooded to a height of 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina..."".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E 100 waewae te whānui o nga wai waipuke** (The floodwaters were 100 feet wide) - The passage states the *erosion* was 100 feet wide, not the floodwaters themselves.
*   **B: Na te wai tiketike i huri te levee** (The strong water broke the levee) - While the levee breaking is implied, the passage doesn't directly state the water *caused* it to break in this section.
*   **D: 6 inihi o te ua i takahi i te awa pakaru** (6 inches of rain overwhelmed the broken levee) - This refers to current concerns, not what happened *during* Hurricane Katrina.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i whakaūngia e Hamilton?,"The correct answer is **B: Te āheinga ki te kānataraki a ētahi atu tūroro i te huaketo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kua whai te hōhipera i ngā tikanga mō te tāmi pokenga, tae atu ki te whakawehe i te tūroro i ētahi atu hei ārai i te whakapoke pea i ētahi atu."" (The hospital followed infection control procedures, including isolating the courier from others to prevent potential spread.) This *implies* they took steps to prevent other couriers from being infected, but it doesn't explicitly state *whether* other couriers were actually infected.

Let's look at why the other options are wrong:

* **A: Te wāhi i haere ai te tūroro** - The passage directly states the courier went to Nigeria.
* **C: Ahakoa i whaia te kawa tika** - The passage explicitly says the hospital followed procedures (""whai te hōhipera i ngā tikanga"").
* **D: Te āhua o nāianei o te tūroro** - The passage says the courier was exposed to Ebola, implying a specific state (exposed to a deadly virus).



"
He aha tētahi mea e hiahia ana ngā kaipūtaiao ki te whakaaro?,"The correct answer is **D: He pēhea te hanganga o te Ao (How the world was formed)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""He wawata tā ngā kaipūtaiao mō te hanganga mai o ngā aorangi, inarā ko Papatūānuku hoki, i te mea i tūtuki ngā auahitūroa ki te Ao nei i mua noa atu.""  This translates to: ""Scientists have a theory about the formation of the heavens and earth, because the elements reached the world long ago.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: No te tūtukitanga o nga kameke ki te Whenua (About the sticking of particles to the Earth):** While relevant to formation, it's too specific. The passage discusses the broader formation of *everything*.
* **B: He pēhea te hanga pūmua (How to make rocks):**  The passage mentions rocks as a *result* of the elements, not the central question the scientists are exploring.
* **C: He aha te take waro (What is the reason for darkness):** This isn't mentioned at all in the passage.



Therefore, the question (Q) asks what the scientists are thinking about, and the passage clearly states they are thinking about the formation of the world."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te tūranga i tākaro ai nga pirihimana paetata i te katinga?","The correct answer is **C: I whakahaua e rātau nga kaieke motokā ki ētahi atu ararere.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ki reira te āwhina o ngā pirihimana 80 hei **tohu i ngā kaitaraiwa waka ki huarahi kē atu.**""  This directly translates to "" ...with the help of 80 police officers to **direct drivers to other routes.**"" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ka tohe rātau ki te FBI kia mahia te katinga** - The passage states the MDTA blocked the tunnel *on the FBI's command*, not that police argued for it.
*   **B: Ka whakataua e rātau kia mahia te katinga** - Similar to A, the police didn't *decide* to close it, they acted on an order.
*   **D: I pūrongotia e rātau he takaware waka i runga i te ara whirinoa** - The passage states no major traffic congestion was reported, meaning they didn't report a traffic jam.



"
He aha i pā ki nga tomokanga ngongo i te wā o te katinga?,"The correct answer is **A: I aukatihia rātau** (They were blocked).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I whakamahia ngā taraka parahanga hei aukati i ngā tomokanga pū..."" which translates to ""Spike strips were used to block the toll booths...""  Therefore, the toll booths were blocked/shut down.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I whakamahia rātau hai mahi** (They were used for work) - The passage doesn't say they were used for any work, only that they were blocked.
* **C: I tuwhera rātau ki nga kaieke motokā** (They were open to motorists) - This is the opposite of what happened; they were *closed*.
* **D: Tērā nga waka taumaha e ārahi ana** (Heavy vehicles were guiding) -  The passage mentions heavy vehicles being diverted *away* from the beltway, not guiding at the toll booths.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea kihai i puta i mua i te tukinga o te kaituhi e te waka?","The correct answer is **A: I whakahaua te kaiwhakaahua e te Huarahi Patrol kia hoki whakamuri i te huarahi.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...i reira te pirihimana California Highway Patrol e whakahaere ana i te tūnga waka ki te tohu i a ia kia hoki atu, kia rua ngā wā.""  This translates to ""...the California Highway Patrol was managing the traffic stop to signal him to turn back, twice."" This clearly indicates the photographer was told to turn around *before* being hit by the car.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage states the photographer *stopped* on the other side of Sepulveda Boulevard, not that they parked there initially.
* **C:** The photographer was *trying* to take pictures of the police stop, but the passage doesn't say they succeeded.
* **D:** The passage mentions Bieber expressing sympathy but does not say the photographer was trying to photograph *him* or if they even succeeded in photographing anyone.



"
He aha te kaiwhakaahua e ngana ana ki te mahi i mua i tana pānga ki te waka?,"The correct answer is **B: Tangohia ngā whakaahua o te tūnga pirihimana** (Take pictures of the police checkpoint).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ko te mōhio a te pae tukutuku pūrongo o te wā ā-rēhia a TMZ i tū te waka a te kaiwhakaahua ki tērā atu taha o Sepulveda Boulevard me te ngana ki te mau whakaahua o te wāhi tūnga pirihimana i mua i te whakawhiti i te huarahi me te koke tonu..."" 

This translates to: ""According to the TMZ news website, the photographer's car stopped across from Sepulveda Boulevard and *tried to take pictures of the police checkpoint* before quickly crossing the road...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Papa i runga i te Boulevard Sepulveda** (Stopped on Sepulveda Boulevard) - While true, it doesn't explain *what* the photographer was trying to *do*.
*   **C: Whakawhiti i tētahi huarahi arokē** (Cross a busy road) - This is what happened *after* attempting to take the photos.
*   **D: Whakaaetia tetahi pirihimana kia tuku tonu ia ki te pupuhi** (Get a police officer to let him through) - The text indicates the police were trying to *stop* him, not let him through.



"
Ko tēhea kōrero kāore e whakaahua tika ana i te āhua o te perehitini i muri i te whakamātautau i te pai mō te huaketo?,"The correct answer is **A: Kaore a ia i te pai (He is not well)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""E ū ana te āhuatanga o te perehitene, ahakoa ka noho mohoao ia ki te kāinga mō ētahi rā."" This translates to ""The minister's condition is stable, although he will stay at home resting for a few days.""  While he's resting, his *condition is stable* – he *is* okay, just needs rest. Saying he isn't well is inaccurate.

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurate reflections of his condition:

* **B: He korokoro mamae tōna (He has a sore throat):** The passage explicitly mentions a sore throat (""Hāunga te kirkā me te korokoro mamae..."").
* **C: Kai roto a ia i te āhua pūmau (He is in a stable condition):**  As mentioned above, the passage directly states his condition is stable (""E ū ana te āhuatanga o te perehitene..."").
* **D: He kirikā tōna (He has a fever):** The passage also explicitly mentions a fever (""Hāunga te kirkā..."").



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei mo te perehitini e pono ana?","The correct answer is **C: Kai te tino pai a ia ki te pūkoro.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hāunga te kirkā me te korokoro mamae, he pai tonu au hei whakahaere i aku mahi mā te wāea kōrero wāea.""  This translates to ""Apart from the cough and sore throat, I am well enough to carry out my duties via telephone."" This clearly indicates he's able to work remotely using the phone (pūkoro - phone).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kāore i a ia te kirikā (He doesn't have a cough):** The passage *specifically* mentions he has a cough (""te kirkā"").
* **B: Ka noho a ia ki te kāinga mo nga wiki maha (He will be staying home for many weeks):** He says he will return to full duties by Monday, implying a short absence (""ētahi rā"" - a few days).
* **D: He tino nui tōna take o te huaketo (His case of the flu is very serious):** While he *has* the flu, the passage suggests it's not severe enough to completely incapacitate him. He's able to work.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i te wā e tūmanako ana kia ngoikore tonu te Huripari o te Huripari o Gonu?","The correct answer is **C: I mua i te taenga atu ki tōna taumata**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ko te matapae ka ngoikore haere tonu."" This translates to ""...the forecast is to continue to weaken.""  This implies the weakening will happen *before* the hurricane reaches its peak/full strength (""tōna taumata"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I mua i te taenga atu ki te Maratiri** - The passage doesn't mention the Maldives (""Maratiri"") specifically in relation to the weakening.
*   **B: I te takanga o te hau, tata ki te 83 mita ia haora** - This refers to the current wind speed, not the *forecast* of weakening.
*   **D: I mua i te taenga atu ki te hau e 149 maire ia haora** - While 149 km/h is a wind speed mentioned, the passage doesn't say it will weaken *before* reaching that speed, but generally weaken.



"
Pēhea te tere o nga hau i te taumata o te Huripari O te Huripari o Gonu?,"The correct answer is **B: 240 maire ia haora**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...i tae te haumātakataka pārū Gonu, (kua ingoatia mō ngā rau niu i te reo o te Maldives) **ki ngā hau tūpuhi o te 240 kiromita ia hāora** (149 mairo ia hāora)."" 

This translates to ""...the strong winds of Cyclone Gonu (named after the palm trees in the Maldivian language) reached **winds of 240 kilometers per hour** (149 miles per hour).""

Therefore, the wind speed at the peak of Cyclone Gonu was 240 kilometers per hour (which is equivalent to 149 miles per hour, as the text clarifies).  The other options are either speeds mentioned later (83 km/h) or incorrect units (meters instead of kilometers/miles).



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i whakaarotia he āhuatanga o te tuakana o Karenia?,"The correct answer is **C: He pūtau-maha**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ka hua mai te tai whero i te kukū teitei ake i te kukū noa o te Karenia brevis, arā ko tētahi **koiora pūtau-kotahi** māori."" (The red tide originates from a bloom higher than the normal bloom of *Karenia brevis*, that is, a native **single-celled** organism.)

This directly contradicts option C, which states it's a *multi-celled* organism (""pūtau-maha"").

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned or implied in the text:

* **A: He momo kapoke** - The passage describes the organism producing a neurotoxin (""paihana ā-roro"") which can harm or kill creatures (like fish) and humans, suggesting it's a toxic/poisonous type.
* **B: Ka taea te mono i ngā io o te tangata** - The passage explicitly states the toxin can harm humans (""ka pāngia te tangata mā te hā i te wai tāhawahawa"").
* **D: He māori noa iho** - The passage confirms the organism is native (""māori"").



Therefore, **C** is the only option *not* supported by the text."
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore e taea e Karena brevis te mahi?,"The correct answer is **A: Monokia ngā io ki te ika** (Poison the fish).

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

* **The text states *Karenia brevis* produces a neurotoxin that kills fish and can affect humans.** This means it *can* poison fish (though indirectly through the toxin).
* **The text highlights that the red tide (caused by *Karenia brevis*) has traits from native single-celled organisms that allow it to thrive and produce a potent toxin.** It specifically mentions the toxin is in the water and affects fish.
* **Options B, C, and D are all either explicitly stated or implied by the text:**
    * **B: Kia tere te whakanui i te tau i raro i ngā āhuatanga katoa** (Rapidly increase its population under all conditions) – The text says it can thrive and rise to high levels.
    * **C: Pā ki te wai** (Float in the water) – It's a water bloom (pūkohu wai).
    * **D: Hanga i tētahi neurotoxin** (Produce a neurotoxin) - The text directly states it produces a neurotoxin.

Therefore, the only option that isn't supported by the text is that *Karenia brevis* directly poisons fish – it produces a toxin *in the water* that does so.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i puta nā te Āwhā o Felicia?","The correct answer is **D: waipuke tiriti (significant flooding)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""he ahakoa kāore anō te kino me te waipuke kia rīpoatangia"" - which translates to ""however, no major damage or flooding has been reported yet.""  This directly indicates that *significant flooding* has **not** occurred as a result of Felicia.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned as results of Felicia:

*   **A: Ngā ua whai hua (Beneficial rain):** The passage states 6.34 inches of rain fell on Oahu and was called ""a good thing.""
*   **B: Ko te marangai e haere tahi ana me te whaititiri (Squalls accompanying the storm):** The passage mentions ""a kurahau-awatea takiwā pārū"" which indicates squalls/gusts.
*   **C: uira auau (Thunderstorms):** The passage explicitly says ""te uira auau"" (thunderstorms).



"
Ko tēhea kōrero mo te Āwhā o Felicia e hē ana?,"The correct answer is **B: I te tuatahi i whakarōpūtia hei pāngarau pāngarau i mua i te huri hei ngaru kāwai 4**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""I ngoikore haere a Felicia, i tētahi wā he āwhā Category 4 ki te Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale...""  This means Felicia *became* a Category 4 hurricane. It didn't start as one.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ko te hua o te marangai i whai painga ai a Oahu** - The passage says Oahu received a ""good"" amount of rain (6.34 inches), implying a benefit. This is *true* according to the text.
* **C: Ko te nuinga o nga moutere i kite i te whakawhānuitanga** - The passage says ""taūaua puta noa i te nuinga o ngā motu,"" meaning flooding was widespread across many islands. This is *true*.
* **D: I haere tahi ētahi marangai i te uira** - The passage mentions ""hekenga ua ko ngā rautupu me te uira auau"" meaning rain was accompanied by lightning. This is *true*.



"
Ko tēhea kōrero e tino whakaatu ana i te putanga o te 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix?,"The correct answer is **C: I pūhia a Piquet Jr. i muri iho**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I peingia atu a Piquet Jr. Whai muri i te Grand Prix 2009 o Hungry."" which translates to ""Piquet Jr. was fired after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.""  This directly relates to what happened *after* that race.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I uru a Fernando Alonso ki tētahi aitua** - The passage mentions Alonso being affected by an incident in 2008, not 2009 Hungary.
*   **B: I tangohia e Piquet Jr. te wikitōria** - Piquet Jr. won a race (Singapore 2008) but the passage doesn’t say he won the Hungarian Grand Prix.
*   **D: I aituā te motokā haumaru** - The passage mentions the safety car being deployed, but doesn't say it crashed.



"
I te wā i puta ai te hinganga?,"The correct answer is **B: I te wā e hinu ana ērā atu motokā** (When other cars were refueling).

Here's why:

The passage states that the safety car came out *after* Alonso pitted, and *while* the cars ahead of Alonso were refueling under the safety car. Piquet Jr. then overtook them all during this period to win.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Whai muri tonu i te whakamutu o Alonso** (Immediately after Alonso finished) - The safety car came out *before* the race finished.
*   **C: I mua i te putanga mai o te waka haumaru** (Before the safety car came out) - The passage clearly states the opposite.
*   **D: I muri i te haerenga o Piquet mo te hinu** (After Piquet went for refueling) - Piquet Jr. overtaking others happened *during* the safety car period when others were refueling, not after his own refueling stop.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei i iti iho te wā i whakapono tuatahitia e nga kaipūkaro?","The correct answer is **A: Te whakatūnga o te momo (The establishment of the species)**.

Here's why:

The passage states researchers initially *believed* the hybridisation process (between the Darwin finch and cactus finch) would take a long time. However, the research *reported* that it takes only two years. This directly relates to how long it takes for a new species (or in this case, a hybrid lineage that *could* lead to a new species) to **establish** itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Pūrongo mō te momo (Reporting on the species):** The passage *is* reporting on the species, but the question asks about what the researchers underestimated.
*   **C: E haere ana i waenganui i te momo rerekē (Crossing between different species):** The crossing itself *happened*, the underestimation was about *how quickly* it led to a result.
*   **D: Te kunenga o te momo (The origin of the species):** While related to species formation, the passage focuses on the speed of hybridisation, not the initial origin.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i whakahuatia e ngā kairangahau?,"The correct answer is **C: Te ingoa o te momo hou**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The research details characteristics of a *new* bird species, but it *doesn't actually state the name* of that new species. It only mentions the parent species – *Geospiza fortes* and *Geospiza conirostris*.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

* **A: Te wāhi i hangaia ai te momo hōu (The location where the new species was created):** The passage explicitly states the new species is found on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
* **B: Te roanga o te tukanga kunenga (The length of the breeding process):**  The passage states the breeding period is estimated to be no more than two years.
* **D: Nga manu i roto i te tāuri (The birds in the pairing):** The passage names the two finch species involved in the hybridization: *Geospiza fortes* and *Geospiza conirostris*.



"
Kei whea te CowParade?,"The correct answer is **B: I te taone o Bucharest**.

The text explicitly states that Bucharest is the first city in Southeastern Europe to host the CowParade. The other options are either too broad (many cities in Romania, all of Southeastern Europe, major European capitals) or incorrect."
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e whakaahua tika ana i a CowParade?,"The correct answer is **D: Ko te takahanga toi tūmatanui nui rawa tēnei i te ao** (This is the largest public art exhibition in the world).

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states: ""...me te pūreitanga toi tūmatawhānui nui rawa o te ao..."" which translates to ""...and the largest public art exhibition in the world.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka tū anake i roto i ngā tāone e whakaarotia ana he “whakaaro”** (It only takes place in cities considered ""trendy"") - The passage doesn't mention this requirement.
* **B: I hangaia e Bucharest City Hall** (It was created by Bucharest City Hall) - While the City Hall is *hosting* it, they didn't *create* CowParade.  The passage states they are using it as part of a larger initiative.
* **C: He kaupapa toi e tū ana i te raumati puta noa i te tonga-rawhiti o Ūropi** (An art project that takes place in the summer throughout Southeast Europe) - The passage specifies Bucharest is the first city in *Southeast Europe* to host it, not that it happens throughout the region.



"
He aha te take i whakamutua ai e Rūhia te whakamahi II-76s?,"The correct answer is **B: He aituā (An accident)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I te rā 7 o Oketopa i wehea tētahi initia i te hārewa, karekau ngā whara. I whakatau taupua a Rūhia i ngā II-76 i muri i taua tukituki."" This translates to ""On October 7th, an incident occurred during takeoff, with no injuries. Russia grounded the II-76s after that incident."" 

Therefore, the reason Russia stopped using the II-76s was due to an accident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā hōia o roto (Interior troops):** While the passage mentions the planes were used by interior troops, this isn't the *reason* they were grounded.
*   **C: Te hōia o Rōpūria (Soviet military):** The Soviet military is mentioned in relation to the plane's history, not as a reason for grounding them.
*   **D: He rangahau kei te tū (Ongoing research):** The passage doesn't mention any ongoing research as a reason.



"
He aha te II-76?,"The correct answer is **C: He rererangi** (He airplane).

Here's why:

The passage states ""He wāhanga nui rawa te II-76 o te ope hōia a Rūhia...ā, kua kitea kētia tētahi aituā nui whakaharahara ki Rūhia i tērā marama."" (The II-76 is a large part of the Russian military...and a major incident was found in Russia this month).  It then goes on to describe an incident with it *taking off* (i te rererangi).  This clearly indicates the II-76 is a type of aircraft.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He waka ruku** (He car) - The context of military operations and flight rules this out.
*   **B: He kura** (He school) - This has no connection to the text.
*   **D: He tereina** (He train) - Again, the context of flight makes this incorrect.



"
Na wai i utu i te kapa kaituhi mo te The Simpsons?,"The correct answer is **B: Simon**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...i haepapa ia mō te whakarite i te rōpū tuhi tuatahi o te whakaaturanga"" which translates to ""...he was credited with assembling the original writing team of the show.""  This means Simon was responsible for paying and organizing the writers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Brooks:** The text says Simon *assisted* Brooks and Groening in creating the show, but doesn't say Brooks paid the writers.
*   **C: Ullman:** Tracy Ullman was involved in the *Tracy Ullman Show* where The Simpsons originated as shorts, but wasn't involved in paying the Simpsons writing team.
*   **D: Groening:** Like Brooks, Groening co-created the show but isn't mentioned as being responsible for the writing team's payment.



"
"E ai ki a Fluke, ko wai i tuku kōrero pai me te whakatenatena ki a ia?","The correct answer is **D: Ngā tāne me te wahine** (Both men and women).

The text states: ""...e whakahau ana he mea nui te mau uhi ārai. *wāhine mai, tāne mai hoki*..."" which translates to ""...encouraging mask-wearing. *from women, from men also...*"" This clearly indicates that Flute received supportive messages from both men and women.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha ētahi tāngata kāore i te hiahia kia kōrero nga wāhine?","The correct answer is **A: Tāne**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Flute wrote about the attempts of *some people* to silence women from the conversation about women's health. These attempts were fueled by messages (from both women *and men*) advocating for maintaining the status quo.  Therefore, the passage directly implicates **men** as being among those who don't want women to speak.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ngā utu rongoā (Medical costs):** The passage doesn't mention medical costs.
*   **C: Te hauora o nga wāhine (Women's health):**  The passage says people want to silence discussions *about* women's health, not that women's health itself is unwanted.
*   **D: Fluke:** Flute is the author, not someone trying to silence others.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea tinana aorangi te tino pūkaha?","The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: """"Ki tā tātou mōhio, kotahi anake te aorangi he nui ake ngā uekaha i a Titan, ko Papatūānuku tōna ingoa,"""" which translates to ""As far as we know, there is only one atmosphere with more haze than Titan, named Papatūānuku.""

This directly indicates that Titan has a significant amount of haze, making it the most prominent (or ""pūkaha"" - powerful/strong/distinctive) celestial body mentioned in relation to atmospheric haze.



"
Kua kitea ngā awa me ngā roto i runga i te wai mārama i runga i tēhea ao?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

Here's why:

The text states: """"Ki tā tātou mōhio, kotahi anake te aorangi he nui ake ngā uekaha i a Titan, ko Papatūānuku tōna ingoa,"""" (roughly translated: ""As far as we know, only one planet has many lakes like Earth, and that is Titan"").  It explicitly mentions lakes (which would include rivers and pools of liquid) being found on Titan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jupiter:** While Jupiter has a complex atmosphere, it's a gas giant and doesn't have a solid surface with lakes and rivers.
*   **C: Te rā (The Sun):** The Sun is a star, composed of plasma, and doesn't have liquid bodies.
*   **D: Saturn:** Saturn is also a gas giant and while it has moons (like Titan), the text specifically identifies Titan as the one with lakes.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei kitenga ehara i te hua o te kitenga o te huruhuru?,"The correct answer is **A: Te tae paramu o te kararehe (The purple colour of the animal)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...pērā ki te tae, me te tōna hanga ahu tengi nei."" (...like the colour, and its distinctive structure).  It then says this colour *isn't* visible on stone impressions (fossils).  Therefore, the discovery of the purple colour isn't *from* the feather itself, but an observation *about* it alongside other structural features.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He māramatanga kāore i whakamahia ngā huruhuru i te rerenga (Understanding the feathers weren't used for flight):** The passage directly links feather structure to temperature regulation/display, implying this understanding *came from* studying the feathers.
* **C: He tirohanga ki te kunenga o te huruhuru (An insight into feather evolution):** The passage states the discovery offers insight into the evolution of feathers, meaning it's a direct result of the feather analysis.
* **D: E whakapumautia ana he huruhuru te nuinga o nga taikaha (It is confirmed that most of the structures are feathers):** This is a core finding *based on* the feather examination.



"
He aha nga huruhuru dinosaur kāore i a ia?,"The correct answer is **A: Barbules**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kāore he āhuatanga kē atu o te huruhuru - ko ngā niwha me ngā barbules - e kī ana ngā kairangahau kāore e kore ko te rachis tētahi mea i kukuwha ake i muri ake i ēnei atu āhuatanga."" 

This translates to: ""...there are no other features of the feather - the vanes and barbules - researchers say the rachis must have evolved after these other features.""

This clearly indicates that the dinosaur feathers *lack* barbules (and vanes).  The passage focuses on the *absence* of these features as evidence of how feather structure evolved.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He rachis (a rachis)**: The passage says the rachis *did* exist, and likely evolved *after* the vanes and barbules.
* **C: Paramu pakeke (adult plumage)**: The passage explicitly states the sample shows adult feathers, not juvenile ones.
* **D: He pale tae ki raro (a lower colour shade)**: The passage mentions colouration as something *not* visible on the stone, implying the feathers *had* colour, but it wasn’t preserved.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki ZMapp ehara i te mea pono?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka āhei te rongoa i ngā mate o mua engari kāore e ārai i te mate** (The medicine can treat existing infections but doesn't prevent illness).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ZMapp, initially showed some promising results in studies, however subsequent research showed it had less benefit than hoped for in preventing death.""  This means ZMapp didn't *prevent* death, and its effectiveness was lower than initially thought.  The option incorrectly states it can treat existing infections (which isn’t explicitly stated, just that it showed *some* initial promise).

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: He mea hanga mai i nga paturopi** (It is made from antibodies) - The passage says ""Kotahi te pāhekoheko paturopi, te ZMapp..."" (One antibody cocktail, ZMapp...)
* **C: I whakamahia hei mana i roto i te whakamātautau PALM** (It was used as a control in the PALM trial) - The passage states ""...ko Zmapp hei pae, arā ka whakamahia e ngā kaipūtaiao hei pūtake..."" (ZMapp as a control, meaning scientists would use it as a base...)
* **D: E whakaatu ana ngā rangahau he iti iho te painga o te reira i te mea i whakaarohia i te tuatahi** (Research shows it has less benefit than initially thought) - The passage explicitly says ""...however subsequent research showed it had less benefit than hoped for...""



"
Ko tēhea o ngā tauākī e whai ake nei e whakamārama tika ana i te whakamātautau PALM?,"The correct answer is **C: I whakamahia a ZMapp hei pūtake o te whakamātautau** (ZMapp was used as a foundation for the trial).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ki te whakamātau PALM, ko Zmapp hei pae, arā ka whakamahia e ngā kaipūtaiao hei pūtake, ā, ka whakatairitea ngā maimoatanga hou e toru i tērā."" This translates to: ""In the PALM trial, ZMapp is the baseline, meaning scientists will use it as a foundation and compare three new treatments to it.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I whakaaturia e ngā rangahau he nui ake pea ngā painga i te mea i whakaarohia i mua** (Research showed potentially greater benefits than previously thought) - The passage states the opposite; initial promise of ZMapp diminished with further research.
* **B: I whakaritea tētahi rongoā whakahaere ki ētahi atu maimoatanga e toru, ko tētahi o ēnei ko te ZMapp** (A control drug was compared to three other treatments, one of which was ZMapp) - While ZMapp *is* involved in comparison, it's not the control drug, it's the *baseline* against which others are measured.
* **D: I whakaaturia he whai hua ki te whakaora i ngā mate o mua** (It showed effectiveness in curing past illnesses) - The passage emphasizes that no cure has been definitively shown for Ebola, even with ZMapp.



"
E whakaaro ana ngā kairangahau ko whea te wahi ka tino nui te maramara hou?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā whenua moni iti (Countries with little money)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the researchers believe this technology could lead to early detection of diseases like tuberculosis, cholera, HIV, and Ebola ""in resource-limited settings"" - which directly translates to countries with little money.  It specifically contrasts this with wealthier nations, stating half the cases are in those areas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngā whenua whai taonga (Wealthy countries):** The passage indicates this technology will be *more* impactful in areas *lacking* resources.
* **C: I Te Hononga o Amerika (In the United States):** While the research *originated* at Stanford in the US, the biggest impact is expected elsewhere.
* **D: I te Whare Wānanga o Stanford (At Stanford University):** Stanford is where the research is happening, but it's not where the biggest benefit will be felt.



"
He aha te tikanga ka whakamahia hei hanga i te taputapu tātaritanga?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngā pūreretā waituhi paerewa** (Standard inkjet printers).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...he rehu-mihini tā iti nei e taea ana te hanga mā ngā mihini tā inkjet noa."" This translates to ""...a tiny engineered fluid that can be created by standard inkjet printers.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kotahi U.S. hēneti ia** (One U.S. cent) - This refers to the *cost* of the device, not how it's made.
* **C: Ngā rīwai tā** (Ink ribbons) - Ink ribbons are not used in inkjet printers.
* **D: Ētahi atu utauta tātaritanga** (Other diagnostic tools) - This is too broad; the passage specifically mentions inkjet printers.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ehara i te tika te kōrero mo nga riwha?","The correct answer is **B: Ko tō rātou aroaro e tohu ana kāore te marama e ngaro i te mahi ā-whenua** (Their presence indicates the moon is not lacking geological activity).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ko tēnei e tohu mai ana ko ngā mahi ā-taiao te take."" (this indicates that natural processes are the cause) and ""...e taupatupatu ana ki te kereme mō te marama ehara he mahi geologic."" (this supports the claim that the moon *has* geological activity).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ko ngā mea i hanga i a rātau i tupu tata nei** (Those who created them grew up recently) - This is irrelevant to the passage.  The passage discusses the *formation* of the scarps, not who created them.
* **C: Tērā pea he hua nō te heke iho o te marama** (Perhaps a result of the moon's decline) - The passage directly contradicts this, stating natural *processes* are the cause, implying ongoing activity, not decline.
* **D: Kāore he tokomaha i kitea i runga i te mata o te marama** (Not many have been found on the surface of the moon) - The passage says these features *have* been found (""I kitea ēnei māheni i te marama"").



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te ariā e pā ana ki ngā āhua o te whenua e tohu ana he mahi whenua kei te puta i runga i te marama?","The correct answer is **D: He tata noa iho te wa i hangaia ai ngā āhua whenua**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...e kitea ana kua raupā haere, ko tēnei e tohu mai ana ko ngā mahi ā-taiao te take."" This translates to ""...they appear to have formed gradually, which suggests a natural cause.""  ""Gradually formed"" implies the features are relatively *recent* geologically speaking, not ancient or pre-existing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kei te heke haere te marama (The moon is sinking/decreasing):** This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **B: I hangaia ngā āhua o te whenua i mua noa atu (The landforms were created long ago):** The passage specifically implies they *haven't* been around for a very long time due to their gradual formation.
* **C: He iti noa iho ngā āhua whenua i runga i te mata o te marama (There are few landforms on the moon's surface):** The passage doesn't discuss the *number* of landforms, only their origin.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea e kore e nui ake tae noa ki te whakapae?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā tānga whakaahua (The publication of images)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ka pāngia pea ngā taunakitanga a ngā kaiwhakaatu ā-karu i te mea i whakaputaina whānuitia tana whakaahua."" ( ""...the recommendations of broadcasters may be affected because his image has been widely published."") and later ""...kei ngā kōti he mea whakakotiti tika pea te whakaputanga whakaahua."" (...in the courts, the publication of images may be assessed carefully.)

The passage specifically mentions the widespread publication of his image and how this might impact proceedings. It also says the Crown office (who control all briefings) have stated no further statements will be made *until the briefing* (which is connected to the charge/indictment).  This implies the image publication is a concern *before* the formal indictment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ētahi atu tākupu (Further articles):** While articles might be written, the passage focuses on the *images* already published.
*   **C: He kōrero mō ngā whakaaturanga a ngā kaiwhakaatu (Talk about broadcasters' views):** The passage mentions broadcasters' recommendations *being affected*, not further talk *about* their views.
*   **D: Ngā tānga Tuhipānui (Press Releases):** The Crown office control briefings, but the specific concern raised is the image, not just general press releases.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te raruraru o nāianei mō ngā hiri?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā āhuatanga o te huarere tino nui** (Severe weather conditions).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hei tāpiritanga ki te tio kino, kua whakararu ngā āhuatanga huarere kino i ngā mahi whakarauora."" (In addition to the oil spill, severe weather conditions have disrupted cleanup efforts.)  This directly identifies the severe weather as the current problem for the recovery efforts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Te nui o te hukapapa** (The amount of ice) - The passage discusses oil and weather, not ice.
*   **C: Te mātotoru o te hukapapa** (The thickness of the ice) -  Same as above, no mention of ice thickness.
*   **D: Melting i te hukapapa** (Melting of the ice) - Again, the passage doesn't mention ice melting.



"
"I tua atu i te hukapapa, he aha anō te mea e pā ana ki ngā mahi whakaora?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā here rangi (Weather conditions)**.

The passage explicitly states that ""severe weather features have disrupted recovery efforts"" and that these features are not expected to improve for a week. This directly relates to weather conditions impacting the recovery work.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kāore he rawa (No resources)** - The passage doesn't mention a lack of resources.
* **C: Kāore he āwhina (No help)** - The passage doesn't mention a lack of assistance.
* **D: Nga hiri (Injuries)** - While the spill itself might cause injuries, the passage focuses on the disruption to *recovery* efforts, specifically due to weather.



"
He aha te whakapono i kore ai a Roberts e whakamana?,"The correct answer is **A: Te tika o te kōrerorero i ngā kēhi** (The right to speak about cases).

Here's why:

The passage states Roberts believes ""it is not ethical to speak about the specifics of cases."" This directly indicates he doesn't support the practice of publicly discussing case details.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Te hiranga o ngā whakataunga ōrite a te Kooti Nui** (The importance of equal rulings by the Supreme Court) - The passage states he *reinforced* his previous stance that Roe v. Wade was ""the law of the land,"" showing he values the weight of Supreme Court decisions.
* **C: Te tīmatanga o te ora** (The beginning of life) - The passage states this is a ""difficult question"" he was asked about, but doesn't say he disbelieves in an opinion.
* **D: Te mana ki te tūmataitinga** (The right to privacy) - He *confirmed* his belief in the right to privacy established by Roe v. Wade.



"
He aha te kaupapa i whakaaro ai a Roberts he kore-pai rawa te kōrero?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngā tauwhāiti o ngā take** (The specifics of the cases).

Here's why:

The passage states Roberts believed it wasn't proper to speak to ""ngā āhuatanga o ngā kēhi"" – which translates to ""the specifics of the cases"". He felt it was inappropriate to comment on the details of individual cases, especially considering the ethical implications of abortion and judicial propriety.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ko te ōrite o ngā Whakatau o te Kooti Nui** (The consistency of Supreme Court rulings) - While the passage mentions respecting precedent (like *Roe v. Wade*), it isn't the reason Roberts thought commenting was improper.
* **B: Te Roe v. Whakatau Wade** (The Roe v. Wade decision) - Roberts affirmed *Roe v. Wade* as settled law, but this isn’t *why* he thought discussing the specifics of cases was wrong.
* **C: Te mana ki te tūmataitinga kua whakaritea** (The right to privacy established) -  Again, this is a belief he *holds*, not the reason he avoids commenting on case details.



"
Kei whea te rua o ngā hihi marama e whiti ana?,"The correct answer is **A: Ki te rangi** (To the sky).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""E rua ngā raiti kaha kua whakaritea ki te aro atu ki te rangi i roto i te pō."" (Two powerful spotlights have been arranged to focus on the sky at night.) This directly links the spotlights to shining *into the sky*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Puta noa i te taone** (Spread throughout the city) - The passage doesn't mention the spotlights spreading throughout the city.
*   **C: I te ūnga o te waka tākaro tuatahi** (At the landing of the first sports car) - The passage doesn't mention sports cars or a landing.
*   **D: I waenganui o te pāmahana whakamaharatanga** (In the middle of the memorial park) - While a memorial park *is* mentioned, the spotlights aren't directed *at* it; they're directed at the sky.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, āhea nga kairangirangi hou e hangaia ana ki te pae?","The correct answer is **D: Kei te haere tonu te hanganga** (Construction is ongoing).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kei te haere tonu te hanganga mō ngā whare teitei rawa hou e rima ki te wāhi..."" which directly translates to ""Construction is ongoing for the five new tallest buildings in the area...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I waenganui o te rā** (Midday) - The text doesn't mention a time of day for the construction, just that it's happening.
* **B: I te 8:46 a.m.** (8:46 a.m.) - This is the time the city was attacked, not when construction is happening.
* **C: Pō** (Night) - The text mentions ""raiti kaha kua whakaritea ki te aro atu ki te rangi i roto i te pō"" (strong lights arranged to face the sky at night), but doesn't say the *construction* is happening at night.



"
He aha ngā mōhiohio e tohu ana he ana The Seven Sisters?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā rerekētanga pāmahana (Temperature differences)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ka whakaatu ngā pikitia hihi pōkākā i ngā pāmahana rerekē i te awatea me te pō e whakaaturia ana he ana pea ērā. He makariri ake i te mata karapoti i te rā, he mahana ake i te pō."" This translates to ""High-resolution images show different temperatures during the day and night, suggesting caves. It's colder than the surrounding ground during the day, warmer at night."" 

This directly links the caves (""The Seven Sisters"") to observed temperature differences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Te rāwhiti o nga tomokanga ana (The direction of cave entrances):** The passage mentions the distance between entrances (100-250 meters) but doesn't focus on their direction.
* **C: Ngā tirohanga papawhenua (Geological views):** While the USGS is involved, the passage focuses on temperature, not overall geological features.
* **D: Ngā pikitia ana i runga i te Whenua (Cave pictures on Earth):** The passage talks about images *suggesting* caves, not pictures *of* caves on Earth. It's about a potential discovery.



"
Me pēhea te kitenga i te whanonga wera o Seven Sisters?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngā puare hōhonu i te whenua (Deep fissures in the ground)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: """"...ēngari e hāngai ana tērā kia noho ēnei hei puare hohono kei te papa,"""" which translates to ""...but that suggests these are deep fissures in the ground.""  Glen Cushing specifically identifies the thermal behavior as being more akin to deep fissures than large caves worldwide.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā atahanga pōkākā (Infrared images):** While infrared images *show* the thermal behavior, they don't *describe* the nature of the thermal behavior itself.
*   **C: Te rāwhiti o nga ana (The orientation of the caves):** The passage doesn't discuss the caves' orientation.
*   **D: Ngā Tirohanga o nga ana i runga i te Whenua (Cave views on Earth):** This is too general and doesn't relate to the *thermal* behavior discussed.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea kōrero mo te hunga whakapae ehara i te pono?","The correct answer is **C: E mōhiotia ana tōna iwi e ngā mana whakahaere.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kāore tonu tōna ingoa i te mōhiotia e ngā mana whakahaere, ahakoa rātou e mōhio nei he mema ia o te rōpū iwi Uighur.""  This translates to ""His name is not yet known to the authorities, although they know he is a member of the Uighur ethnic group.""  Therefore, his ethnicity *is* known.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A & B: I whakamahia e ia he waka i te wā o te whakaeke** - The passage states he drove a three-wheeled vehicle *with a bomb* - not just *a vehicle*. While a vehicle was involved, these options don't capture the full detail.
* **D: Kāore a ia i whara** - The passage explicitly says he was injured in the explosion: ""i muri i tāna whara i te pahūtanga"" (""after his injury in the explosion"").



"
He aha ngā mōhiohio e pā ana ki te whakaeke i whakapumautia e ngā mana?,"The correct answer is **B: Te iwi o te hunga whakapae**.

Here's why:

The text states the authorities *do* know the attacker is a member of the Uighur ethnic group. This directly answers the question of what information the authorities have established about the attacker.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā tuakiri o ētahi hoamahi:** The text doesn't mention accomplices.
* **C: Ko te kaupapa i muri i te whakaeke:** The text doesn't say *why* the attack happened, only *what* happened.
* **D: Te ingoa tuatahi me te ingoa whakamutunga o te whakapae:** The text explicitly states the attacker's name is *not* known.



"
Ko tēhea kapa ka tākaro i te tukinga ki Ellis Park?,"The correct answer is **C: Āwherika ki te Tonga me Ahitereiria** (South Africa and Australia).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka tū te kēmu whakamutunga o te raupapa ki Ellis Park ki Johannesburg hei tērā wiki, hei reira ngā Springboks e tākaro ki a Ahitereiria."" (The final game of the series will be at Ellis Park in Johannesburg next week, where the Springboks will play Australia.)

*   **Springboks** is the nickname for the South African national rugby team.
*   Therefore, the game at Ellis Park is between South Africa (Springboks) and Australia.



"
Kei whea ngā Springboks e tākaro ai i tō rātou tukinga e whai ake nei?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ka tū te kēmu whakamutunga o te raupapa ki Ellis Park ki Johannesburg hei tērā wiki, hei reira ngā Springboks e tākaro ki a Ahitereiria.""  This translates to ""The final game of the series will be held at Ellis Park in Johannesburg next week, where the Springboks will play against Australia.""



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei mea i raru ai te teihana mokowhiti i te wā o te misioni?,"The correct answer is **B: Kei te pupuri i tētahi gyroscope** (It was having trouble with a gyroscope).

Here's why:

* **P:** states ""ahakoa te ngaronga o te mīhini gyroscope ki te teihana wātea..."" - This translates to ""despite the malfunction of the gyroscope machine at the space station..."" This directly indicates the gyroscope was a problem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kei te pupuri i te tawhiti matau mai i ngā kaituki** (Maintaining a calculated distance from trackers) - The text mentions a safe distance was *reported* regarding beam targeting, but doesn't say the station *struggled* to maintain it.
* **C: Whakahohenga Jet** (Jet discharges) - The text says jet discharges were *activated* on the Russian segment, not that they were a problem.
* **D: Te whakahoki i te āhua o te āhua** (Returning to a normal configuration) - The text states the station *returned* to normal, implying it wasn't normally in that state due to the gyroscope issue, but doesn't say the returning itself was a problem.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te take o te mahi a te teihana mokowā?","The correct answer is **A: Te kimi i tētahi gyroscope ngaro** (To find a missing gyroscope).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states ""ahakoa te ngaronga o te mīhini gyroscope ki te teihana wātea..."" which translates to ""despite the loss of the gyroscope machine to the space station..."".  This directly indicates the station was operating *because* of the missing gyroscope, implying they were looking for it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Te whakatata atu ki ngā pūkaha whakatika** (Getting closer to corrective positions) - The text mentions ""pana panoni waiaro"" (attitude adjustments) but doesn't say the station was *trying* to get closer.
* **C: Whakaoti ana i tētahi haerenga mokowā** (Completing a space walk) - The passage mentions the end of a walk (""ki te mutunga rā anō o te hīkoi"") but this isn't the *reason* the station was operating.
* **D: E whakarite ana i nga pūkaha** (Adjusting positions) - While attitude adjustments were made, this wasn't the primary function driving the station's operation in this instance.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki te take ehara i te mea pono?,"The correct answer is **A: I whakawakia ki te kawanatanga kei reira te tari matua o AOL**.

Here's why:

The passage states the case was filed in Virginia *because* that's where AOL's primary service provider was located – the company that originated the spam. It **doesn't** say that AOL's headquarters were there, only that their key service provider was.  This is a subtle but important distinction. The lawsuit targeted the source of the spam, not necessarily where AOL's main offices were.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: I whakaritea he whakapae:** The passage implies a lawsuit (whakapae) was filed, so this is likely true, but it doesn’t relate to a factual inaccuracy.
*   **C: I whakamahia te ture e pā ana ki te īmēra waipēhi i roto i te take:** The passage mentions a 2003 law designed to stop mass emails (including spam), so this is accurate.
*   **D: I te whakahikotia te AOL:** The passage focuses on the source of the spam and AOL’s role as the *recipient* of the spam, not being the accused party.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e tino tika ana te whakaahua?,"The most accurate depiction based on the provided text is **D: I tīmataria e AOL te mahinga o te kēhi**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""...koirā te kāinga ki te kaituku ratonga ipurangi matua a AOL, arā ko te kamupene nā rātou ngā panoni i tīmata."" ( ""...that was home to the primary internet service provider AOL, that is, the company that started the lawsuits."") This clearly indicates AOL initiated the legal action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I whakahikotia a AOL ki te tuari kāore i te mōhiotia:** The text doesn't mention AOL being accused of anything.
* **B: I pā te take ki ngā kaiwhakarato ratonga ipurangi nui e rua:**  The text only focuses on AOL.
* **C: I whiua te kēhi i te tau 2003:** The text states a law was *created* in 2003, but doesn't say the lawsuit *happened* in 2003, only that it was the first time the law was tested.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea karapu i tīmata ai a Vidal ki te tākaro mo te toru wā ki mua?","The correct answer is **A: Sevilla**.

The passage states: ""Kua tūhono a Vidal e 28 tau te pakeke i Barca e toru kaupeka ki muri, **mai i Sevilla**."" This translates to ""Vidal, 28 years old, joined Barca three seasons ago, **from Sevilla**.""  Therefore, he played for Sevilla before joining Barca.



"
E hia ngā kēmu kua tākaro a Vidal mō Barça?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The text explicitly states: ""Mai i te wā i neke ki te tāone matua o Catalan, kua tākaro a Vidal i ngā kēmu e 49 mō te karapu."" (Since moving to the Catalan capital, Vidal has played 49 games for the club.)



"
Ko wai te kapa whakahee i te tukinga?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""I noho iho ia ki te hōtera o te tīma i mua i te tukinga i whakaritea mō te Rātapu ki a **Bolonia**."" This directly identifies Bolonia as the team Jarque was playing against.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jarque** - Jarque is the player, not the opposing team.
*   **C: Coverciano** - Coverciano is a training center, not a team.
*   **D: Italy** - While the training was in Italy, Bolonia is the specific team mentioned as the opponent.



"
He aha a Jarque i noho ai ki te hotera?,"The correct answer is **B: He hui tōmua tōna**.

Here's why:

The text states ""I noho iho ia ki te hōtera o te tīma i mua i te tukinga i whakaritea mō te Rātapu ki a Bolonia."" This translates to ""He stayed at the team hotel before the match scheduled for Sunday against Bologna.""  Staying at the team hotel *before a match* strongly implies a pre-match meeting or preparation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He mahi tāna** - While he was training, the text specifically says he stayed at the hotel *before* the match, not while doing work.
* **C: He ōrite tōna i te Rātapu** - This doesn't make sense in the context. The text talks about preparation *for* Sunday, not being the same as Sunday.
* **D: I te whakangungu a ia ki Bolonia** - He trained *before* going to the hotel, not *at* the hotel.



"
He aha e kore ai e tukuna he whakatūpato e te pokapū ā-whenua o Jakarta?,"The correct answer is **D: Kāore i tutuki i a ia ngā whakaritenga nui mō ngā rū**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...kāore tētahi whakatūpato tai āniwhaniwha e tukua i te mea kāore te rū o te whenua i tae ki te hiahia o te 6.5.""  This translates to ""a tsunami warning was not issued because the ground level had not reached the requirement of 6.5.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kaore he tuma o te tsunami:** The passage doesn't say there *wasn't* a tsunami, only that a warning wasn't issued.
* **B: Hei karo i te āwangawanga i waenga i ngā kainoho:**  The passage doesn't mention avoiding panic as the reason. In fact, people *were* evacuating despite the lack of a warning.
* **C: Hei karo i te pānga ki ngā pakihi o te rohe:**  The passage doesn't mention protecting businesses as a reason for not issuing the warning.  Businesses were already being affected by the evacuation.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te take o te rū?","The correct answer is **D: He 6.5 i runga i te tauine nui** (A 6.5 on the Richter scale).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kāore tētahi whakatūpato tai āniwhaniwha e tukua i te mea kāore te rū o te whenua i tae ki te hiahia o te 6.5."" This directly translates to: ""...a tsunami warning was not issued because the earthquake magnitude did not reach the requirement of 6.5."" 

Therefore, the reason for the lack of a warning was the earthquake's magnitude being below 6.5.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā tangata whenua i panitia** (Locals organized) - The passage doesn't mention locals organizing anything related to the warning.
*   **B: He tuma tsunami** (A tsunami) - While a tsunami is the potential *result* of an earthquake, it's not the reason a warning wasn't issued.
*   **C: He whakatūpato i tukuna** (A warning was issued) - The passage explicitly states a warning *wasn't* issued.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e akiaki ana i te mahi a te Rā me ētahi atu whetū katoa?,"The correct answer is **B: Tau Rossy, hurihanga, me te hurihanga aukume**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Kei te whakamahia tahitia te kanapā me te huringa hei whakatau i te tau Rossby a tētahi tau, ā, e hāngai ana tērā ki te rere wētoto... Te iti iho o te nama Rossby, ka ngoikore ake te whetū mō te āhuatanga ki te hurihanga aukume.""  This directly links Rossby number, rotation, and angular momentum to the behavior of the Sun and other stars.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Te marama me te rere plasma (Light and plasma flow):** While light *from* stars is observable, the passage doesn't state these *cause* the stars' behavior. Plasma flow is related, but not the central point.
* **C: Te hurihanga me te marama (Rotation and light):**  Again, rotation is mentioned, but light isn't a driving factor as described in the text.
* **D: Te marama, te nama Rossby, me te hurihanga (Light, Rossby number, and rotation):**  Light isn't presented as a causal element; Rossby number and rotation are.



Therefore, **B** most accurately reflects the factors identified in the passage as influencing the behavior of the Sun and other stars."
Me pēhea te whakatau i tētahi tau Rossby whetū?,"The correct answer is **A: Te marama me te hurihanga (Brightness and rotation)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kei te whakamahia tahitia te kanapā me te huringa hei whakatau i te tau Rossby a tētahi tau..."" which translates to ""...brightness and rotation are used to determine a star's Rossby number..."".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Te nui o te rere taitoto (The amount of flow)** - While the Rossby number *relates* to flow, the passage directly states brightness and rotation are *used to calculate* it.
* **C: Te taumata ngohe (Viscosity level)** - Viscosity isn't mentioned in the passage as a factor in determining the Rossby number.
* **D: Te nui o ngā whakawhitinga hautō (The amount of autocorrelation)** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
He aha te ōrau o ngā tāngata i tirotirohia e tautoko ana kia tū wawe a Ahitereiria hei kāwanatanga?,"The correct answer is **B: 29 ōrau**.

The text states: ""Ko ngā tonu nui o te pōti, **29 paeheneti** e mea ana me wawe tonu te tū a Ahitereiria i runga i tōna ake mana motuhake..."" which translates to ""The main results of the poll, **29 percent** said that Australia should become independent as soon as possible..."""
"E ai ki a Julie Gillard, āhea ka riro ai a Ahitereiria hei kāwanatanga?","The correct answer is **B: I muri i te kingitanga o Kuini Elizabeth II**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I whakapono a Pirimia Julia Gillard nōnā e whakarite ana mō te pōtitanga whānui kia noho a Ahitereiria i runga i tōna ake mana motuhake whai muri mai i te matenga o Kuini Irihāpeti II.""  This translates to ""Prime Minister Julia Gillard, who was organizing the referendum, believed that Australia should become independent after the death of Queen Elizabeth II.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ākuanei** - The passage doesn't suggest immediate independence.
*   **C: Kore Rawa** - Gillard *did* have a belief about when Australia should become independent.
*   **D: I muri i te pōti a te hau** - While a referendum was being considered, the passage links independence to the Queen's reign, not the outcome of the vote itself.



"
Ko tēhea whakahaere kei raro i te rangahau ā-ture?,"The correct answer is **C: Mātua Kua Whakaritea (Planned Parenthood)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...kei te mātai a Stearns mēnā rānei kei te whakamahia ngā tāke hei utu i ngā whakatahe mā Planned Parenthood..."" This directly translates to ""...Stearns is investigating whether taxes are being used to pay for Planned Parenthood's attacks...""

Therefore, Planned Parenthood is the organization under legal scrutiny.



"
Ko Cliff Stearns te māhunga o tēhea komiti?,"Ko te whakautu tika ko **A: Ko te Komiti o te Whare o Ngā Waiora me te Hokohoko**.

I te tuhinga, kua kōrero mēnā ko Cliff Stearns te heamana o te Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, kei raro tērā i te tuanui o te House Energy and Commerce Committee."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea kaore i pā ki te wahine swis?","The correct answer is **B: I patua a ia** (She was murdered).

Here's why:

The text states the woman was *robbed* of her laptop and phone (""i raupatu i te wahine Swiss nei, ā, i kitea hoki ōna rorohiko me tōna waea pūkoro""). It doesn't mention anything about her being harmed physically or murdered.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I whakaorangia ana taonga tāhae** (Her stolen belongings were recovered) - This is true, but it's what *happened* to her belongings, not what happened *to her*.
*   **C: I tukinotia ia e ngā tāngata e 5.** (She was beaten by 5 people) - The text doesn't mention any physical assault.
*   **D: I tāhaetia tana waea me tana rorohiko pona** (Her phone and laptop were stolen) - This is true, but it's the event that occurred, not something that *didn't* happen to her.



"
Ko tēhea kamupene i whakawhiwhia ki te Whakawhiwhinga Mārō o Taiwana i te tau 2007?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The passage explicitly states that ASUS received the Sustainable Taiwan 2007 award. Therefore, ASUS is the company that was awarded the award in 2007."
He aha te RW ASUS Eee?,"The correct answer is **B: He rorohiko pona** (Laptop).

The passage states ""Ka tū a ASUS Eee PC..."" and describes it with features like being energy-saving and having good performance – characteristics of a laptop computer. ""PC"" stands for Personal Computer, and ""Eee PC"" was a very early, small, and affordable laptop.



"
Ko wai te kawenga mō ngā tuhinga mēra ngaro?,"The correct answer is **C: He tama**.

The text explicitly states: ""kua hunaia e te tama te neke atu i te 600 puka poutāpeta..."" which translates to ""the boy hid over 600 postal books..."".  This directly identifies the boy as responsible for the missing items.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā kaimahi poutāpeta (Postal workers):** While they *discovered* the missing items, they weren't responsible for hiding them.
* **B: He rōpū o ngā kainoho o Obanazawa (A group of Obanazawa residents):** The text doesn't mention any group involvement, only a single boy.
* **D: Te pāpāho (The media):** The media simply *reported* on the situation; they didn't cause it.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nāna i tuku whakapae e pā ana ki ngā tuhinga ngaro?","The correct answer is **D: Te tari poutāpeta o Obanazawa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Inanahi, i tukuna e te poutāpeta tā rātou whakapāha ki ngā kirirarau me te pāpaho..."" which translates to ""Yesterday, the post office released their statement to the media and broadcasting...""  This means the post office (Tari Poutāpeta o Obanazawa) made the report about the missing items.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā tangata whenua o te rohe (Local residents):** The passage doesn't mention local residents making a complaint.
* **B: Te tama (The boy):** The passage states the boy *hid* the items, he didn't report them missing.
* **C: Te pāpāho (The broadcasting/media):** The media *received* the statement, they didn't *make* it.



"
I te wā e hiahia ana a Del Potro ki te whakatutuki i tana raruraru pokohiwi?,"The correct answer is **C: I te wā o te huinga tuarua**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I riro i a Potro he rongoā mō tana pokohiwi i tēnei wā ēngari i hoki tonu atu ki te kēmu.""  This translates to ""Potro received treatment for his shoulder *during this time* but returned to the game.""  ""This time"" refers to the second set (huinga tuarua) as it directly follows the mention of Del Potro struggling in the second set and the score reaching 6-6.



"
He aha te hua o te wehenga here tuatahi?,"The correct answer is **A: I ngaro i a Mauri i te huinga tuatahi** (Murray lost the first set).

Here's why:

The text states: ""I hinga a Murray i te huinga tuatahi..."" which directly translates to ""Murray lost the first set..."" 

The other options are incorrect based on the provided text:

*   **B:** The text mentions Del Potro needing medical attention, not collapsing.
*   **C & D:** The text details events in the *second* set, not a win by either player in the first set.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko wai, i whakapā atu ki tētahi tūroro?","The correct answer is **B: Tamariki**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""I āta kī a Perry, """"I tēnei rā, i ako mātou ko ētahi tamariki he kura te pakeke kua tautohua he pānga ō rātou ki te tūroro."""" ""  This translates to ""Perry said, """"Today we learned that some children at a school have been identified as having a connection to a shooter."""" ""

Therefore, the text specifically says *children* had a connection to a shooter. While the governor (Perry) is *reporting* this, he isn't the one who was in contact with the shooter.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te whakaūnga i kore ai te kāwana e mahi i te wā e kōrero ana ki nga tangata whenua o TeKiki?","The correct answer is **A: Kei te pai te mahi a te pūnaha** (The system is working well).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kauka e māharahara, e haere pai ana te pūnaha ki tāna e āhei ai"" - which translates to ""Doctors are worried, but the system is working as well as it can."" This directly addresses a concern about the system's performance and the Governor's assurance that it *is* functioning.  This is the closest response to why the Governor seems unconcerned while speaking to the public.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kei te mahia ngā mahi hei tiaki i te haumaru o te iwi whānui** (Work is being done to protect public safety) - This is stated as a *reason* for the actions, not a reason why the Governor isn’t worried.
* **C: Kua oti i a rātau te whakarite ki te whakatutuki i te wero** (They have prepared to meet the challenge) - The Governor says they are *well-prepared* but doesn’t explicitly state the challenge is already met.
* **D: Ehara te take i te tino nui** (The issue isn't very big) - The Governor explicitly calls it a ""major issue"" (""He take nui tēnei"").



"
Ko tēhea puna kōrero parody i hangaia e ngā ākonga o mua o te UW?,"The correct answer is **D: Te Aniani** (The Onion).

The passage explicitly states: ""Mai i tana orokohanga mai kua noho te aniana hei rangatiratanga pono o te emapaia parody..."" which translates to ""Since its inception, The Onion has been a true leader in satirical parody...""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te Pūrongo Colbert** (The Colbert Report) - mentioned as a show *following* The Onion's work, not created by them.
*   **B: Te Kāreti Pōti** (Electoral College) - a political institution, not a parody source.
*   **C: Te Whakaaturanga o ia Rā** (The Daily Show) - also a show *following* The Onion's work, not created by them.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i roto i te rangatiratanga o te rongo o Onion?","The correct answer is **B: He pikitia**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions these as part of The Onion's output:

*   A website (""he paetukutuku"")
*   Print editions (""he putanga tā"")
*   An atlas of the world (""ngā pakihere me ngā atlas o te ao"")

It does **not** mention pictures (""he pikitia"") as being part of The Onion's offerings.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea i tiakina e nga pirihimana?","The correct answer is **C: Te tomokanga o te Tiriti Whakararo** (The entrance to Downing Street).

Here's why:

The text states: ""I tīmata te porotēhi i te 11:00 wā takiwā (UTC+1) ki Whitehall, **kei tua atu i te tomokanga e hēteritia ana e te pirihimana ki te tiriti o Downing**..."" This directly translates to ""The protest began at 11:00... outside the entrance guarded by police to Downing Street.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tapawhā Trafalgar (Trafalgar Square):** The protest *moved* towards Trafalgar Square, but it wasn't what the police were initially guarding.
*   **B: Te Huinga o te Kōanga (The Spring Conference):** This is mentioned as the destination, not what was being guarded.
*   **D: Ko te Grand Connaught Rooms hotera (The Grand Connaught Rooms hotel):** This is the final destination of the protest, not what was initially guarded by police.



"
I te āhea te wā i tono ai te pirihimana kia neke atu ngā kaiwhawhai kia kore ai e nui ake te waka?,"The correct answer is **D: I te 11:20**.

The text states: ""I te 11.20 i pātaingia e ngā pirihimana ngā kaiporotēhi kia hoki atu ki te ara paparaima, me te whakatau iho kia tika te tauritenga o te porotēhi ki te tini o ngā waka e whakatōpu ana.""  This directly translates to ""At 11:20 police asked protestors to move back to the pavement, deciding to ensure the protest didn't disrupt the flow of traffic.""

He aha te pono mo te rangahau i mahia e Dr. Ehud Ur?,"The correct answer is **B: Kua kore ētahi kiore huka i mua i te huka.**

Here's why:

The text states: """"""Kei a tātou ināianei ngā kiore e 4-marama te pakeke kāore i te pāngia e te mate huka, ahakoa i mua i pāngia e te mate huka,"""" tana kōrero tāpiri. (We now have 4-month-old mice that are not affected by diabetes, even though they were previously affected by diabetes, he added.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tērā pea ka whai painga ngā hua ki ngā tūroro whai mate huka Momo 1 tīariari (The results may benefit people with type 1 diabetes):** The text explicitly states the research *doesn't* relate to people with type 1 diabetes.
*   **C: E tūmanako ana a ia ka āhei nga kitenga ki te rongoā (He hopes the findings can lead to a cure):** While he's a researcher, the text says he's *doubtful* about a cure, not hopeful.
*   **D: Ināianei he huka ētahi kiore kāore i te huka (Some mice now have diabetes that didn't have it):**  The text says the opposite - mice *don't* have diabetes now, even though they *did* before.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha a Dr. to whakaaro tika?","The correct answer is **C: Ko nga whakaaro o ētahi atu tohunga e pā ana ki te rongoā** (The thoughts of other experts regarding a cure).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pēnei i ētahi atu tōhunga, kei te ruarua kē ōna mahara e pā ana ki te whakaora i te mate huka..."" This directly translates to ""Like other experts, he is skeptical about curing diabetes...""  Dr. Ur's thought is specifically *about* what other experts are thinking regarding a cure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mēnā e hāngai ana ngā kitenga mō ngā tāngata whai mate huka Momo 1** (Whether the findings apply to people with Type 1 diabetes) - The passage explicitly states the findings *don't* apply to Type 1 diabetes.
*   **B: Ki te taea te rongoā** (Whether a cure is possible) - While related, the passage says he's *skeptical* of a cure, not simply thinking about its possibility.
*   **D: Ki te noho tonu ngā kiore kāore i te huka** (That the mice remain diabetes-free) - This is a *fact* presented in the passage, not Dr. Ur's specific thought or opinion.

Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei kāore e whakaahua tika ana i te hinganga o te rerenga CG4684?,"The correct answer is **C: E toru ngā ngana o te waka rererangi ki te tau iho i mua i te hinganga**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the plane *attempted* to land once (kua ngana te Twin Otter ki te tau ki Kokoda inanahi).** It doesn't mention multiple attempts before crashing.  It crashed *on* its approach, not after several failed landings.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **A: Kāore i taea e te waka rererangi te eke ki raro nā te huarere:** The passage explicitly states the bad weather hindered the landing (""I whakararurarungia te rapunga e te huarere kino i kore ai te waka i tau."")
* **B: I hinga te rererangi ki tētahi wāhi tino tawhiti:** The fact that police had to *walk* to the crash site (""ka tukuna ngā pirihimana e rua ki te ngahere kia hīkoi ki te wāhi rā"") implies it was in a remote location.
* **D: I pāngia te rapu mō te wāhi i hinga ai te rererangi e te rangi:**  The passage directly states the search was hampered by bad weather (""I whakararurarungia te rapunga e te huarere kino..."").



"
He aha te take i haukotia ai e Flight CG4684 tōna tauranga?,"The correct answer is **A: Kāore i taea te uru atu ki te wāhi tūruhi (The aircraft was unable to land at the landing site)**.

Here's why:

The text states ""I whakararurarungia te rapunga e te huarere kino i kore ai te waka i tau."" This translates to ""The search was hampered by bad weather which prevented the aircraft from landing.""  This directly explains why Flight CG4684 didn't make its landing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He maha ētahi atu rererangi i mua i te CG4684 (There were many other flights before CG4684):** The text doesn't mention any other flights.
* **C: I kōrerotia te waka rererangi ki Kokoda (The aircraft was diverted to Kokoda):** The plane *was* going to Kokoda, but didn't land, it went missing before landing.
* **D: He rawakore nga āhuatanga o te huarere (The weather features were insufficient):** While bad weather *caused* the issue, the issue itself was the inability to land.

"I runga anō i te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki te wheako o Franciszek Kowal?","The correct answer is **A: I taea e ia te wawahi i tētahi matapihi** (He was able to break a window).

Here's why:

The passage states: """"Kātahi anō ka pakaru tētahi o ngā matapihi, ā, kā tīmata rātou te puta atu mā te matapihi,"""" (Then one of the windows broke, and they started to get out through the window).  Franciszek Kowal is the one *witnessing* this, and the passage implies his actions (or the actions of those with him) led to the window breaking, allowing escape.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I te mutunga ka kore a ia i te mōhiotia** (In the end he didn't know) - The passage doesn't suggest he was confused or lacked knowledge.
* **C: I pakaru tētahi tūru i a ia e ngana ana ki te puta** (A door broke as he tried to get out) - The passage specifically mentions *windows* (matapihi), not doors (tūru).
* **D: I whara a ia i a ia e ngana ana ki te whati i tētahi matapihi** (He was injured as he tried to break a window) -  The passage doesn't mention any injuries to Franciszek Kowal.



"
He aha i uaua ai te whakatau i te pānga o te Huringa Tropical Danielle?,"The correct answer is **C: Kai tawhiti atu te āwhā i te whenua**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""I te mea he tawhiti te whaititiri i te horonga whenua, ka uaua rā te aromatawai i ngā pānga ki te United States ki Caribbean rānei.""  This translates to ""Because the storm is far from land, it is difficult to assess the impacts on the United States or the Caribbean.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E tohu ana te āwhā kia kaha ki te āwhā** - While the storm is *forecast* to strengthen, this doesn't explain *why* it's hard to predict the impact.
*   **B: Kāore e tino mōhio ngā kaipūtaiao mō ngā hau o te tupuhi** - The text *does* mention wind speeds, so scientists have *some* knowledge.  The issue is distance, not lack of data on winds.
*   **D: He tawhiti rawa te āwhā i Miami** - While it's far from Miami, the relevant question is about impacts on land *generally* (US and Caribbean), not specifically Miami.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki te Hurricane Danielle he teka?","The correct answer is **D: E tata ana ki te whenua**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""I te mea he tawhiti te whaititiri i te horonga whenua, ka uaua rā te aromatawai i ngā pānga ki te United States ki Caribbean rānei.""  This translates to ""Because the hurricane is far from land, it is difficult to assess the impact on the United States or the Caribbean.""  Therefore, Danielle is *not* close to land.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: Kāore i te mōhiotia te pānga ki ngā Kāriana (The impact on the Caribbean is unknown):** This is true, as the passage says it's difficult to assess the impact.
* **B: I hangaia ki te Moana Aterangi (Was formed in the Atlantic Ocean):** The passage states ""kua puea mai i te taha rāwhiti o te moana Atlantic"" (originated from the eastern side of the Atlantic Ocean).
* **C: Tērā pea ka huri hei āwhā (May turn into a whirlwind/major storm):** The passage says scientists expect Danielle to strengthen (""ka kaha haere"").



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea e whakahuatia ana me pā ki te mate i mua i te take o te urutā huri noa?","The correct answer is **B: Me noho māmā tonu ngā tohu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ka āhua maninohea noa te pā o te tahumaero i mua i te hōrapatanga urutā..."" which translates to ""...the impact of the virus seems mild before the mutation occurs...""  This directly implies that symptoms (""tōhu"") should remain mild before the virus mutates and potentially becomes more dangerous.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Me iti iho te whakamate (There should be fewer deaths):** The passage doesn't focus on mortality rates, but rather the *severity* of symptoms.
*   **C: Me whakapoke ētahi atu tāngata (More people should become infected):** The passage expresses *concern* about wider spread, not a requirement for it.
*   **D: Me wheako ngā tamariki i ngā āhuatanga (Children should experience symptoms):**  The passage mentions children *being affected* but doesn't suggest they *should* experience symptoms.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he pēhea te tawhiti atu i Fujian te āwhā?","The correct answer is **C: 70 mita**.

The passage states: ""I te pō o te 9 o Akuhata **whitu tekau kiromita** te tawhiti o te karu o Morakot i te rohe o Fujian."" (On the night of August 9th, the Morakot storm was **seventy kilometers** away from the Fujian region.)

Therefore, the distance from Fujian is 70 kilometers (which is equal to 70,000 meters, but the options seem to be using meters as the unit).  Since 70 is the closest option, it's the correct answer.



"
Ko wai i mihi ki a Hōri W. Bush i tōna taenga atu ki Āhia?,"The correct answer is **D: Te Pirimia Tuarua**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""I mihia ia e te Pirimia Tuarua o Hingapoa a Wong Kan Seng..."" which translates to ""He was greeted by the Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore, Wong Kan Seng..."". 

Therefore, the Deputy Prime Minister greeted George W. Bush upon his arrival in Asia.



"
I te wā i kōrero ai te peresideni mō te whakawhānui hokohoko o Āhia?,"The correct answer is **C: I muri i ōna hinganga pōti waenganui**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Whai muri i te kotahi wiki o ngā hinganga ki te kōwhiringa pōti waenga wā, nā Bush i whaki atu ki tētahi minenga mō te whakawhānuitanga o te hokohoko ki Āhia.""  This directly translates to ""After a week of setbacks in the mid-term elections, Bush spoke at a gathering about expanding trade in Asia.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I tōna taenga atu ki Hingapoi** - He arrived in Singapore, but didn't immediately talk about trade expansion.
*   **B: Me Wong Kan Seng** - He met with Wong Kan Seng, but the passage doesn't link that meeting to the trade expansion speech.
*   **D: Puta noa i tana haerenga wiki ki Āhia** - While it happened *during* his trip, the text specifically states it was *after* the election setbacks.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei te whāinga katoa a te kāwanatanga?","The correct answer is **C: Acquire ētahi atu pānga e 1,300**.

Here's why:

The passage states the government's funding increase will allow colleges to accommodate a total of 1,300 students.  ""Pānga"" likely refers to students in this context. The funding increase *results in* being able to accept 1,300 students, making that the goal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Whakaputahia ētahi atu waka tae noa ki te Maehe o tēnei tau** - This talks about vehicles and a deadline, not students.
*   **B: Acquire 300 ngā pānga katoa** - The increase is *in addition to* existing capacity, bringing the *total* to 1,300. 300 represents the *increase*, not the overall goal.
*   **D: Whakangūtia te nui o nga pā** - This talks about training, which isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
He aha te whakapuaki a te kāwanatanga?,"The correct answer is **A: E whakaaro ana rātau ki te whakarato i ētahi atu pānga e 300** (They are considering providing an additional 300 effects/impacts).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""He tāpiritanga 300 e kapi katoa ai ngā hariata ki te 1,3000..."" (An addition of 300, bringing the total to 1,300...)
* This directly translates to the government planning to *add* 300 more.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: E whakaū ana rātau ki te whakawhirinaki i te raruraru pā** (They are confirming reliance on a crisis) - The passage doesn't mention a crisis.
* **C: E whakaaro ana rātau ki te whakarato i ētahi atu pānga e 1,300** (They are considering providing an additional 1,300) - The passage states the *total* will be 1,300, not an additional 1,300.
* **D: Ka whakaotitia te raruraru nui rawa atu i a Poutāpeta** (The biggest problem in Poutāpeta will be solved) -  Poutāpeta isn't mentioned and the passage doesn't discuss solving a problem.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha ngā mōhiohio e mōhiotia ana?","The correct answer is **C: E tūmanakohia ana he whakaeke** (An attack is expected).

Here's why, based on the provided Māori text (P):

* **""Kāore he mōhiohio hei marohi kei te tataritia tonutia tētahi ekenga.""** This translates to ""There is no intelligence to defend against a planned attack.""  This *directly* states an attack is being planned/expected.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kua whakahekea te taumata tuma** (The security level has been lowered) - While the text mentions a security level (""taumata mōrearea""), it doesn't say it has been *lowered*, only that its loss doesn't necessarily indicate overall security is compromised.
* **B: Kua kore he tuma** (There is no security) - The text *implies* security is threatened, but doesn't say it's completely gone.
* **D: Kua whakapumautia e te Rongoā ka kaha te whakaeke** (Intelligence has confirmed a strong attack) - The text says there's *no* intelligence (""Kāore he mōhiohio""), so it couldn't be confirmed by intelligence.



Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the text is that an attack is anticipated."
Ko tehea o ngā kōrero e pā ana ki ngā whakaeke ehara i te mea pono?,"The correct answer is **A: Ko te komihana a te perehitini he urupare ki nga amuamu** (The president's commission is a response to the protests).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ko te kōmihana he whakautu nā Martelly mō te horapatanga o te porotēhi ātete kāwanatanga i tīmata i te Oketopa."" (The commission is a response by Martelly to the violent government protests that began in October.)  This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ko ngā pōti kua whakamutua i whakaoho i ngā amuamu** (Completed elections sparked the protests) - The passage implies the *lack* of elections (or delayed elections) caused the protests, not completed ones.
* **C: I tonoa e nga whakahē te tukunga iho o te CEP o mua** (The protesters requested the removal of the previous CEP) - The passage says a commission *determined* the release (removal) of the CEP, not that protesters directly requested it.
* **D: I ētahi wā he pākaha nga whakahē** (The protesters were sometimes violent) - While the passage mentions ""violent government protests,"" it doesn't specifically say the protesters themselves were violent at all times, just that the protests *were* violent.



"
Na wai i whakaaro kia whakarere te CEP whakamutunga?,"The correct answer is **C: Ko te Komihana Perehitini (The Presidential Commission)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I tautuhia e tētahi komihana perehitene te rihainatanga o te CEP o mua..."" which translates to ""A presidential commission determined the release of the former CEP..."".  This clearly indicates the Presidential Commission was the entity that decided to remove the previous CEP.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Martelly:** While Martelly established the commission, the *commission* made the decision, not Martelly directly.
*   **B: Ngā kaiwhakahaere (The managers):** The text doesn't mention managers making this decision.
*   **D: Na nga mema o te CEP i huatau ko rātau anō (By the CEP members themselves):** The passage states the commission *determined their release*, meaning they weren't the ones initiating the change.



"
"E ai ki te kōrero, he aha te mea e kore e tautokohia e te USA Gymnastics i muri i te tukino a Nassar ki ngā kaitākaro?","The correct answer is **A: Whakakoretanga (Revocation)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ka tautoko te takaporepore USA i tētahi tirohanga motuhake e rewa ake ai ngā āhutanga whakamanioro o ngā mahinga i kōrerotia māiangia e ngā mōrehu o Larry Nassar...kaua ko te whakakore tiwhikete.""  This translates to ""USA Gymnastics supports a unique perspective that arises from the emotional impacts of the actions described by Larry Nassar's survivors...*not* license revocation.""

The passage clearly indicates USA Gymnastics *does not* support revoking licenses as a response to the abuse.  The other options are all things the passage says USA Gymnastics *does* support.



"
"E ai ki te kōrero, he aha te whāinga matua o te USA Gymnastics me te United States Olympic Committee e haere whakamua ana?","The correct answer is **D: Whakatoko ana i tētahi taiao haumaru mō ngā kaipūkaro** (Creating a safe environment for athletes).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...kei te hiahia waiwai o te whānau Olympic hei tuku i tētahi taiao haumaru mō te katoa o ā mātou kaipara"" (the Olympic family's strong desire to provide a safe environment for all of our athletes) and ""...kia taea ai e ngā kaiaka te whai i ā rātou whāinga i roto i tētahi taiao manaaki me te tiaki"" (so that athletes can pursue their goals in a supportive and protective environment).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E mārama ana i runga i te tūkinotanga a Larry Nassar** (Understanding based on the abuse by Larry Nassar) - While the Nassar abuse is *related* to the changes being made, it's not the ultimate goal itself.  It's the reason *why* they want a safer environment.
* **B: E whai ana i te whakawāteatanga** (Pursuing accountability) - Accountability is a part of the process, but not the overall goal.
* **C: E whai ana i tētahi tūhuratanga tūmataiti** (Pursuing a limited investigation) - The passage suggests a comprehensive and ongoing commitment to improvement, not a limited investigation.



"
I haere te kaipuke ki hea i te wā i puta ai te aitua? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""i te haere te kaipuke ki Puerto Princesa ki Palawan."" This directly translates to ""as the ship traveled to Puerto Princesa to Palawan.""  This indicates Palawan was the ship's destination at the time of the incident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: United States:** The text mentions the ship being associated with the US Navy, but doesn't say it was *in* the US when the incident occurred.
*   **B: Puerto Rico:** Puerto Rico is not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Hapani:** While the ship is *stationed* in Sasebo, Japan, it was traveling *to* Palawan when the event happened.



"
He aha te mea ehara i te mea pono mo te kaipuke e whakahuatia ana i te wāhanga nei?,"The correct answer is **C: He kaipuke ātete tēnei** (This is a warship).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He kaipuke whakakore maina rōpū Avenger"" - which translates to ""An Avenger-class mine countermeasures ship.""  A ""mine countermeasures ship"" is *not* a warship in the traditional sense. It's designed for clearing mines, a support role, not direct combat.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: I a ia e haere ana ki Puerto Princesa** - The passage explicitly says the ship is traveling to Puerto Princesa.
* **B: E ai ki Palawan** -  Puerto Princesa *is* in Palawan, so this is true.
* **D: Kua whakaritea ki te Whitu o nga Fleet o te Moana o U.S.** - The passage states it is assigned to the Seventh Fleet.

Therefore, the statement that the ship is a warship is the inaccurate one.



"
Ko wai i tuku i te kōrero e pā ana ki nga hoia o Amerika?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

The text states: ""I roto i tētahi tauāki nā te Perehitene o Amerika nā Donald Trump i te heketeri o ngā perehi..."" which translates to ""At a press conference by the President of America Donald Trump...""  He was the one who announced the withdrawal of American troops.



"
"E ai ki te whakapuakitanga, ko tehea whenua i whakawhiwhia ki te kaitiaki i nga kaiwhawhai herehere?","The correct answer is **D: Turkey**.

The text states: ""Ka whai mana hoki a Tākei mō te tiaki i ngā kaiwhawhai ISIS kua mauheretia..."" which translates to ""Turkey was also given the responsibility of protecting the captured ISIS fighters..."". 

Therefore, Turkey is the country given the responsibility for the detained fighters, according to the statement.



"
He aha te mea e whakapono ana ko te take o te hinga?,"The correct answer is **D: Rangi kino** (Bad weather).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...e whakaponotia ana nā te pū taraweti i pēnei ai"" which translates to ""...it is believed to be due to the weather."" It also mentions the search is hampered by ""the huarere kino, me te whenua pakeke"" - bad weather and difficult terrain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Whenua pākaha** (Difficult terrain) - While mentioned as hindering the search, it's not believed to *cause* the crash.
*   **B: Te ahi kaihautū** (Pilot error) - The passage doesn't mention anything about pilot error.
*   **C: Whenua Maunga** (Mountainous terrain) -  Similar to difficult terrain, it's a location factor, not the cause of the crash according to the passage.



"
He aha te āhua o te whenua i puta ai te hinganga?,"The correct answer is **D: Maunga**.

The passage states: ""I te tihi rā anō o te whenua maunga nei te wāhi i tūtukingia ai..."" which translates to ""The crash site is on the peak of this mountainous land..."". 

Therefore, the landform where the crash occurred is mountainous.



"
He aha ngā tūmanako a ngā mana whakahaere nā te waipuke?,"The correct answer is **A: Te whakaoratanga o ngā pae kirikiri (The restoration of sandbars)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kei te tūmanako ngā āpiha ka rawaka kia whakahaumanu i ngā pae oneone ngāhorohoro ki raro iho."" This directly translates to ""...officials hope to succeed in restoring the shallow sandbars below.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Te hanganga o nga one (The creation of dunes)** - The passage doesn't mention creating dunes.
* **C: He nui ake te maha o ngā chubs takawai (An increase in the number of chubs)** - While the passage mentions the humpback chub is endangered, the *hope* isn't just about increasing chub numbers, it's about restoring the habitat that would *allow* chub populations to recover.
* **D: Ētahi atu wāhi waiora (More habitats)** -  While restoring sandbars *will* create more habitat, the passage specifically focuses on the sandbars themselves as the restoration goal.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei i pā pūmau tonu te hanganga o te matatara?,"The correct answer is **D: Kua horahia te Sediment (Eroded Sediment)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Whai muri i te hanganga o te pāpuni i te tau 1963, i aukatingia ngā waipuke ā-kaupeka kua tino toha pari puta noa i te awa.""  This means the dam stopped sediment flow down the river.
* **The passage also states:** ""...kei te tūmanako ngā āpiha ka rawaka kia whakahaumanu i ngā pae oneone ngāhorohoro ki raro iho."" This means officials hope to rebuild the sandy beaches *below* the dam.  This implies the beaches have been eroded due to lack of sediment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pae kirikiri (Rocky banks):** The passage discusses sandy beaches (""tāhuna"") not rocky banks.
* **B: Humpback chubs:**  The passage states humpback chubs are dwindling or endangered – they are *affected* by the dam, not a consequence of its construction.
* **C: Ngā wāhi noho o te araora (Wildlife habitats):** While the dam impacted habitats, the *direct* result of dam construction regarding the physical riverbed is sediment disruption.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nāna i hoatu te āhua o Te Hononga o Amerika mo nga haerengatērā pea?","The correct answer is **C: He pūtake kāore anō kia herea**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the US issued the warning based on intelligence from an ""unnamed source.""  It doesn't identify *who* is planning the attacks (only ""fighters from Humārie"") but doesn't attribute the intelligence itself to a specific entity.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā kaiwhakahārua Hūmārie (Humārie fighters):** The passage says they are *planning* the attacks, not providing the intelligence.
*   **B: Te kāwanatanga o Etiopia (The Ethiopian government):** The passage says the targets are *in* Ethiopia, not that the government is the source of the warning.
*   **D: He pūtake i Kēnia (A source in Kenya):** While Kenya is mentioned as a target, the source is not identified as being *from* Kenya.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e whakamārama tika ana i te mahere whakaeke a nga kaiwhakarua?,"The correct answer is **B: Whakapakūtia ngā pomu i ngā whenua e rua**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states the warning is about plans to launch explosive devices into **both** Kenya *and* Ethiopia (""ki Kenia me Etiopia"").  Therefore, the plan involves deploying bombs in two countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Whakapakūtia ngā pomu i ngā rohe i tētahi whenua** - Incorrect. The plan involves two countries, not one.
*   **C: Whakapakūtia ngā pomu i ngā rohe i ngā whenua e rua** - While correct that it's two countries, ""rohe"" (regions) isn't explicitly mentioned. The passage refers to the countries themselves being the target.
*   **D: Whakapakūtia ngā pomu i tētahi whenua** - Incorrect. The plan involves two countries, not one.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā tāngata e whai ake nei ehara i te rōia?,"The correct answer is **D: Makis Triantafylopoulos**.

Here's why:

* **Petros Mantouvalos** is explicitly stated as a ""mema Pāremata me te rōia"" (Member of Parliament and a lawyer).
* **Sakis Kechagioglou** and **George Nikolakopoulos** are referred to as ""rōia rongonui"" (famous lawyers).
* **Makis Triantafylopoulos** is described as a ""kairīpoata"" (journalist).  The text states he *presented* a show, but doesn't identify him as a lawyer.

Therefore, Makis Triantafylopoulos is the only person listed who is *not* a lawyer.



"
Ko tehea rōpū tāngata e kore e whakahuatia hei wāhanga o te aitua i roto i te hapori ture Kariki?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngā Kaipānui (Journalists)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    * **Rōia (Lawyers):** Kariki, Kechagioglou, Nikolakopoulos, and Mantouvalos are all lawyers implicated in wrongdoing.
    * **Ngā Kaiwhakawa (Judges):** The text states the events have raised a ""significant storm"" about past illegal acts by judges.
    * **Ngā Rōia (Lawyers):** This is simply a repetition of the first point - lawyers are central to the scandal.

* **Ngā Kaipānui (Journalists)** are *involved* in *revealing* the scandal (Makis Triantafylopoulos), but they are not described as *part of* the corruption *within* the legal community itself. They are the ones exposing it.



"
E hia nga paepae i ngaro i Īnia?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...i ngā ono e 2. I tino pai te tākaro a ngā kaipatu pōro ō waenganui... i ngā whā 11..."" which translates to ""...and six for 2. The middle-order batsmen played very well...and four for 11...""

This means India lost **7** wickets in total (4 + 3 = 7). The text specifically mentions 4 wickets falling for 11 runs, and then later 3 wickets after the captain's dismissal.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te tapeke teitei rawa o nga wāhanga?","The correct answer is **C: 100 ngā whakahaere**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ā, kotahi rau ā rāua piro."" which translates to ""and both of them scored a century (100 runs).""  This directly indicates the highest score achieved during the innings was 100.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 70 ngā whakahaere** - While mentioned, it's a partnership score, not the highest individual score.
* **B: 36 ngā whakahaere** - This is the score after the captain's wicket fell, a low point in the innings.
* **D: 41 ngā whakahaere** - This is a mention of the fours hit, not a score.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei ehara i te take o te āhua o Arama Cuerden?,"The correct answer is **A: Te kaupapahere hōu a te pae e pā ana ki ngā ihirangi tōkai (The new policy of the site regarding image licenses)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Cuerden is upset about:

*   Wales ""dismissing"" them from the beginning.
*   Legal reasons for the action taken.
*   Wales appearing to listen, then reversing course and removing his contributions (""toi"").

The passage directly mentions Wales removing Cuerden's work (B: Muku toi o Weera) and implies Wales wasn’t truly listening (C: Kāore i te whakarongotia e Weera). It also suggests the removal of work was presented under false pretenses (D: Lies mō te take o te muku toi).

However, the passage *doesn’t* mention a new policy regarding image licenses as a reason for Cuerden's frustration. It says the current actions are *leading to* a policy being written, but the policy itself isn't the *cause* of his distress.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha i mukua mai i te pae?","The correct answer is **A: Toi**.

The passage states: ""Tuarua, nā te whakaata i tāna whakarongo mai ki a mātou, tae noa atu ki te **whakakorenga o āna toi**."" (Secondly, because of showing his listening to us, including the deletion of his **art**.)

Therefore, art was removed from the site.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tēhea o ēnei e kore e tautokohia e Amir Khan?","The correct answer is **A: Tae atu ki nga kairiri wāhine i te nga Orimipia** (Women competing in the Olympics).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states Amir Khan said, """"Ko tōku tino whakaaro me kaua te wahine e whawhai. Koinei tōku whakapae."""" which translates to ""My opinion is that women should not fight. That is my belief."" This directly shows he doesn't support women competing in combat sports like those in the Olympics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngā tauwhāinga Peretania** (British teams) - He *did* support British competitors, as the passage states he would support them at the 2012 Olympics.
* **C: Nga whakaaro o nga wāhine** (Women's opinions) - The passage doesn’t discuss his view on women’s opinions in general, only their participation in fighting.
* **D: E hautū ana a Rāwāhi i te nga Orimipia** (Rawahi competing in the Olympics) - This person isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tēhea o ēnei e tautokohia ana e Amir Khan ahakoa tōna whakaaro whaiaro?","The correct answer is **C: Ko ngā Orimipia 2012**.

Here's why:

The passage states that despite his belief that women shouldn't fight (""Ko tōku tino whakaaro me kaua te wahine e whawhai""), Amir Khan *did* support British athletes at the 2012 Olympics (""Ahakoa ana kōrero i kī ia māna e tautoko ngā kaiwhakataetae nō Peretānia hei ngā Taumāhekeheke o Te Ao o te tau 2012 ka whakatūria ki Rānana""). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā kairiri wahine** - The passage explicitly states he *doesn't* believe women should fight.
*   **B: Ko ana hoa whakataetae mai i nga Orimipia 2004** - The passage mentions his win in 2004 but doesn't say he supported his fellow competitors from that event.
*   **D: Ētahi atu toa hiriwa** - The passage specifically mentions supporting athletes at the 2012 Olympics, not just any athletes.



"
No hea i mate ai a Pita Lenz?,"The correct answer is **C: I te hōhipera**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...i kawea atu ki tētahi hōhipera ki te rohe rā, ā, nāwai rā ka mate ia ki reira."" This directly translates to ""...he was taken to a local hospital, and subsequently died there.""

While the accident *happened* during the warm-up and involved a fall and being hit, he actually *died* in the hospital.



"
Ko wai a Xavier Zaira?,"The correct answer is **B: Tētahi atu tauomaoma (Another racer)**.

Here's why:

The text states ""...i tukitukia e tana hoa whakataetae a Xavier Zayat."" This translates to ""...was hit by his competitor, Xavier Zayat.""  Therefore, Xavier Zayat is another racer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He kaimahi rongoā i runga i te ara (A medical worker on the track):** The text says medical staff *helped* after the crash, but doesn't identify Zayat as one of them.
*   **C: He tākuta (A doctor):** Same reasoning as A.
*   **D: He pīataata (A spectator):** The text clearly states Zayat was involved in the crash *as a competitor*.



"
I roto i tehea āhuatanga ka whai hua ai te kaihaerere e manukanuka ana ki te mōhio ki te mahi o roto o te waka rererangi?,"The correct answer is **B: Mēnā he wehi ki te kore e mōhiotia te mea e kore ai rātou e pai ki te rere** (If they are afraid of not knowing what will happen during the flight).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ki ētahi, mā te mārama ki ētahi āhuatanga o te mahi a ngā waka rererangi, me ngā mahi i te wā o te rerenga, he mea tautoko pea hei patu i te mataku e noho ana ki ngā āhuatanga kāore i te mōhiotia, o te noho kore mana whakahaere rānei.""  This directly translates to: ""For some, understanding some aspects of how airplanes work, and the processes during flight, can help to overcome the fear stemming from the unknown, or feeling of lack of control.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ki te whakama te pāhihi i to rātau wehi** (To be ashamed of their fear) - The passage says there's *no* reason to be ashamed, not that understanding airplanes helps with shame.
* **C: Mehemea he kino te pāhihi ki ngā momo haerenga katoa** (If they have a bad experience with all types of travel) - The passage specifically discusses fear of *flying*, not all travel.
* **D: Mēnā ko te āwangawanga i puta mai i ngā āhuatanga kino kāore e pā ana ki te rere** (If the worry comes from bad things unrelated to flying) - The passage focuses on anxieties *related* to the flight itself and the unknown aspects of it.



"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei me mahi i tētahi haere utu nui?","The correct answer is **C: Whakataurite utu i waenga i ngā kamupene haere maha** (Compare prices between multiple travel companies).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""he pai te whakatairite i ngā putanga rapunga me te titiro hoki ki te pae tukutuku ake a te kamupene waka rererangi i mua i te hoko tīkiti"" - which translates to ""it is good to compare search results and also look at the airline's own website before buying a ticket.""  This directly implies comparing *between* different sources.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Rapua ngā tuku a ngā kamupene haerenga maha** (Search for deals from many travel companies) - This is a *part* of the process, but doesn't emphasize the crucial *comparison*.
* **B: Puka hāngai tonu ki te waka rererangi** (Book directly with the airline) - While the passage suggests checking the airline's website, it doesn't advocate *only* booking directly.  Comparison is still key.
* **D: Tirohia te paetukutuku a te waka rererangi** (Check the airline's website) - Again, mentioned in the passage, but not the main action needed for a ""significant cost saving.""



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, me aha ngā haere i te tuatahi kia haumaru ai i ngā utu rererangi tino pai rawa atu?","The correct answer is **B: Whakatauritea ngā utu i waenganui i ngā kaiwhakawhiwhi rerekē** (Compare prices between different providers).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""…he pai te whakatairite i ngā putanga rapunga me te titiro hoki ki te pae tukutuku ake a te kamupene waka rererangi i mua i te hoko tīkiti."" This translates to ""...it is good to compare search results and also look at the airline's own website before buying a ticket.""  Comparing between different providers is a key part of that advice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tirohia te paetukutuku a te waka rererangi** (Check the airline's website) - While the passage *mentions* checking the airline's website, it's presented *in addition to* comparing prices, not as the first step.
* **C: Tuhia tika mā te kamupene rererangi** (Write directly to the airline) - The passage doesn't mention contacting the airline directly.
* **D: Tuhia tika ki tētahi kaihoko haerenga** (Write directly to a travel agent) - The passage doesn't mention contacting a travel agent.



"
He aha te wā e hiahiatia ai he hoa ki te haere tahi ki te tuku?,"The correct answer is **C: Mēnā kei te tukuna ngā mea hei peke rehitatia** (If the goods are being sent as a registered package).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko ngā ture a te taunga rererangi, ka kore e tukuna ngā pēke ki te kore tētahi tangata e rere, ko koe tēnā."" (Airport rules do not allow packages unless someone is flying, that is you.)

This directly means a person needs to be flying with the package if it's sent as a package (presumably a registered one, given the context of needing to meet airport rules).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mēnā ka tukuna ngā taonga mā te waka rererangi** (If the goods are sent by air freight) - The passage discusses needing a person to travel *with* the package, not general air freight.
* **B: Ina whakamahi te kamupene i ōna ake rererangi** (When the company uses its own planes) - The passage states problems *even* when companies use their own planes.
* **D: Mēnā kei te whakahaerehia te tuku e tētahi kamupene nui ake** (If the delivery is handled by a larger company) - This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, i a koe e whiriwhiri ana i tētahi kamupene rererangi Frequent Flyer i roto i tētahi hononga, ko tēhea o ngā mea e whai ake nei e tika ana kia whakaūhia e koe?","The correct answer is **C: Ko te kamupene rererangi e haere pinepine ana koe** (The airline you fly most often).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes choosing an airline *you* frequently use.** The point is to accumulate points and benefits with an airline you'll actually fly.  The other options are less important if you don't regularly fly with that airline.

Let's look at why the other options are less ideal:

* **A: Ko te kamupene rererangi e tuku ana i te nuinga o ngā tohu** (The airline that offers the most points) - While attractive, points are useless if you don't fly with the airline to earn them.
* **B: Ko te kamupene rererangi i roto i te hononga nui rawa atu** (The airline in the largest alliance) - Alliance size is helpful for *redeeming* points, but doesn't guarantee you'll earn many in the first place.
* **D: Ko te kamupene rererangi pea e tāpiri ana i ētahi atu mana motuhake** (The airline that might add extra perks) - Perks are nice, but secondary to regularly flying and earning points.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko wai e tuku atu ana i ētahi atu frequent flyer?","The correct answer is **A: He kamupene rererangi rerekē i roto i tētahi hononga rerekē** (A different airline within a different alliance).

Here's why:

The passage states ""...ngā piro rere a ētahi kē atu kamupene rererangi"" - ""...flights of *other* airlines"".  This directly implies that other airlines offer frequent flyer options *within* the same alliance, or potentially even *different* alliances.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** Focuses on *your* airline, not others offering frequent flyer options.
* **C:**  Again focuses on *your* airline's frequent travel, not what others offer.
* **D:** Suggests other airlines within the *same* alliance, but the passage emphasizes a broader possibility of options.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tēhea o ngā pūkenga e whai ake nei ka pāngia e te haurangi?","The correct answer is **B: Tirohanga (Vision)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka mate te ate i te inu waipiro, whāia mai hoki ka **kāpō**, ka mate.""  ""Kāpō"" means blind, directly relating to a loss of **vision**.  The passage also mentions illegal alcohol potentially containing substances that can cause blindness (""e kāpō ai"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Whakarongo (Hearing):** The passage doesn't mention anything about hearing being affected.
* **C: Tāwara (Taste):** While alcohol affects taste, the passage doesn't specifically mention this.
* **D: Kakara (Smell):** The passage doesn't mention smell being affected.



"
"E ai ki te kōrero i roto i te haerenga, he aha e taea ai te whakaiti i ngā pānga kino o te waipiro?","The correct answer is **C: Tīmata ana i te waipiro i runga i te ngāwari** (Start drinking alcohol in moderation).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka rerekē te pā o te waipiro ki ia tangata, ā, he tino hira te mōhio ki tō tepenga."" (The effect of alcohol varies from person to person, and it is very important to know your limit).  This directly supports the idea of drinking in moderation to reduce negative effects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tīmata ana i te waipiro ki te methanol** (Start drinking alcohol with methanol) - Methanol is *extremely* dangerous and poisonous, and the passage specifically warns about harmful substances found in illegal alcohol.
*   **B: E inu ana i ngā wairua i hangaia noatia** (Drinking manufactured spirits) - The passage warns against illegal alcohol which may contain harmful substances.
*   **D: E inu ana me ngā tāngata rerekē** (Drinking with different people) - This doesn't relate to reducing the harmful effects of alcohol itself.



"
Kei whea ngā uara o ngā whare i waenganui i ngā uara o Amsterdam?,"The best answer is **B: I roto i tētahi wāhi kua tohua hei wāhi tuku iho o te Ao UNESCO**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Kei te tohua te takiwā katoa hei UNESCO World Heritage Site mō tana uara ahurea, hītori ahurei, ā, kei waenga i ngā mea teitei o te whenua ana uara whenua."" (The entire area is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its cultural and unique historical value, and among the highest values of the land.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Te Takiwā o Canal:** This is *where* the values are, but doesn't *explain* what those values are in relation to Amsterdam.
* **C: Ngā wāhi i tangohia mai i te Binnenstad:**  This describes the location but not the *value* being highlighted.
* **D: Ngā tauwāhi whai uara hītori:** While true, the passage emphasizes the UNESCO designation as the core reason for its significance.



"
He aha i whakaingoatia ai te Takiwa o te Canal hei Taonga Taonga o te Ao a UNESCO?,"The correct answer is **A: He uara hītori, ahurea hoki** (It has historical and cultural value).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...kei waenga i ngā mea teitei o te whenua ana **uara whenua**, **uara ahurea**, **hītori ahurei**..."" (among other things its national value, cultural value, and unique history).  This directly supports the idea that it was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site *because* of its historical and cultural significance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: He āhuatanga ahurei** (Unique features) - While true, the text highlights *why* those features are important (history & culture).
*   **C: He tauwāhi e karapoti ana i te Binnenstad** (A location surrounding Binnenstad) - This is a description of *where* it is, not *why* it's a UNESCO site.
*   **D: He uara āhuatanga tiketike** (Important landscape features) - While landscape is mentioned, it's secondary to the cultural and historical value.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e haere ana ki Phnom Krom whai painga?","The correct answer is **A: Te tirohanga i runga i a Tonle Sap**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ko te āhua hiawe o te temepara me te tirohanga o runga i te roto Tonle Sap e hiahiatia ai te piki i te puke."" (The beautiful scenery of the temple and the view over Tonle Sap lake make the climb worthwhile). This directly highlights the benefit of visiting Phnom Krom - the view of Tonle Sap.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Haere ana i roto i te Hipa Angkor:** While you *need* an Angkor Pass to enter, the pass itself isn't a *benefit* of going to Phnom Krom, it's a requirement.
* **C: Tirohia ana te Reap Siem:** The passage doesn't mention seeing Siem Reap as a benefit.
* **D: Ka haere te poti ki te roto:** While a boat trip to the lake can be combined with a visit, the passage doesn't present the boat trip *as* the benefit of going to Phnom Krom, but rather as something you can do *along with* it.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea e hiahiatia ana kia tomo ngā manuhiri ki Phnom Krom?","Ko te whakautu tika ko **C: Kei te tiki i te Hipa Angkor**.

I kōrero te wāhanga, ""Me whiwhi i te Pāhi Angkor kia tomo i te temepara, nōreira kaua e wareware kia haria mai tō uruwhenua i te haerenga ki Tonle Sap."" Ko tāna tikanga me whiwhi koe i te Pāhi Angkor (Angkor Pass) kia haere ai ki Phnom Krom.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tehea o ēnei e āhei ai te turuhi ki te haere ki Antarctica?","The correct answer is **C: He hōtaka mahi e āhei ai te haere i a Hōnea me Hānuere** (A work program that allows travel in November to February).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ka taea anake te tū ki te raumati atu i te marama o Nōema ki Pēpuere..."" (you can only stand in the summer from November to February).  It also mentions a large number of workers (ruarua mano - thousands) live there during the summer in four stations. This indicates organized work programs are the primary way people are present in Antarctica during those months.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He tahua haere whānui** (A general travel plan) - The passage explicitly states travel is *expensive* and requires being *very physically fit*, suggesting it's not casual tourism.
* **B: Ko te hiahia anake ki te tūhura i te Moana Ross** (The desire only to explore the Ross Sea) -  While the Ross Sea is mentioned, it doesn't say that's the *only* reason people go.
* **D: Ngā nekeneke ōkiko whāiti** (Small scientific expeditions) - While science is implied, the passage focuses on the large number of *workers* at the stations, not just small expeditions.



"
Ka toro atu te turuhi e hiahia ana ki te eke maunga ki tehea wahanga o Antarctica?,"The correct answer is **C: Te Peninsula**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kua mātua whakawhāititia ki te Peninsula, ngā Islands me te Ross Sea."" and then later says ""...mō te eke maunga, te tae atu rānei ki te Tōpito o te Ao, kei reira tētahi wāhi noho nui.""  This directly links mountain climbing expeditions to the Peninsula area, as it's where the base camp for reaching the South Pole is located.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te Moana o Ross:** While mentioned, it's not specifically linked to mountain climbing.
*   **B: Te takiwā o te Whenua:** This refers to the continent as a whole, not a specific climbing region.
*   **D: Te nga Moutere:**  The islands are mentioned alongside the Peninsula, but the focus on mountain climbing is on the Peninsula.



"
Kei whea te wāhi iti rawa o te tūnga o tētahi mātakitaki i mua i te wā o nāianei?,"The correct answer is **C: Kei tētahi tauwāhi mamao** (In a remote location).

Here's why:

The passage (P) states that older observatories are often in disrepair but are being repurposed as museums or educational sites *because* modern observatories are built in more suitable locations – ""wāhi kōkēi"" (high places) and with better atmospheric conditions (""āhuatanga kōhauhau pai""). This implies older observatories were *not* in ideal locations, and therefore likely were more accessible – and therefore closer to towns and potentially the city center (which rules out B), and not necessarily on a university campus (which rules out D). The passage contrasts those locations with the more remote locations of modern observatories.  ""Tauwāhi ngāwari noa iho"" (a simple/easy place) is too vague.

Therefore, the most likely place an observatory stood *before* modern ones were built was in a less-than-ideal, more accessible, and thus *remote* location relative to current best practices.



"
Kei whea te wāhi e tū ai tētahi pouaka whakaata rangahau hou?,"The correct answer is **D: I roto i tētahi pānga nui**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te nuinga o ngā karu whātata rangahau hou he hanganga rahi rawa ki ngā wāhi kōkēi me ngā āhuatanga kōhauhau pai.""  This translates to ""Most new research observatories are large structures in remote locations with good atmospheric conditions.""  A ""pānga nui"" (large complex/site) best describes a remote location suited for a large research observatory.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I roto i tētahi whare taonga (In a museum):** The passage states *old* observatories become museums, not that new ones are *in* museums.
* **B: I runga i tētahi whare wānanga (On a university campus):** While universities *use* observatories, the passage emphasizes the need for remote locations.
* **C: I tētahi pae akoranga (On a learning site/school grounds):** Similar to universities, this doesn't align with the need for remote, undisturbed locations.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea e kore e whakaarotia he tohutohu tika mō te whakatangitangi pai i te kōkiri?","The correct answer is **A: Mō tētahi atu rōrahi, whakanuia te tōpana i patua ai e koe ngā kī** (To get a louder sound, raise the height at which you hit the keys).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: **""Kia maumahara kāore he take mō te pato i ngā patooro ki te tōpana nui mō te oro teitei ake pērā i tā te piano.""** (Remember there's no need to lift the fingers high for a louder sound like a piano). This directly contradicts option A.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

*   **B: Puritia te nekeneke koretake ki te mōkito kia taea ai te pupuri i tō kaha** (Keep your wrists loose so you can conserve energy) - The text advises against tension: **""Me ngana kia kaua e tino māro ngā nekenekenga kei ō ringa.""** (Try not to tense your wrists.)
*   **C: Kia mahara ki te tuki i nga tuhipoka i a ia e pupuri ana i tētahi ringa māhorahora** (Remember to strike the notes while keeping one hand relaxed) -  The text encourages relaxation: **""Kia mahara ake, me tau tō ringa i a koe e whakatangi ana i ngā oro...""** (Remember, let your hand rest as you play the notes...)
*   **D: Whakanuia te tere o tō whakahaere i te pūkaha kia nui ake ai te rōrahi** (Increase the speed of your fingering to increase volume) - The passage supports using puffs (likely breath control in this context) to increase volume: **""Ki te kōriana, kia nui ake te kahaoro, ka whakamahia ngā pupuhi ki te pēhanga nui ake, te tere nui ake rānei.""** (To cresendo, use puffs to increase pressure, or speed).



"
"I a koe e whakatangi ana i te kōkiri, ko tehea o ngā mea e whai ake nei ka āwhina ki te whakanui ake i te reo?","The correct answer is **A: Tere anō** (Faster).

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

* **""Ki te kōriana, kia nui ake te kahaoro, ka whakamahia ngā pupuhi ki te pēhanga nui ake, te tere nui ake rānei.""**  This translates to: ""To blow, to make a louder sound, use more breath with more pressure, or *faster*.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tōpana anō** (Higher pitch) - The text specifically states *not* to push the keys up higher for louder sound (like a piano).
* **C: Pēhanga iti iho** (Less pressure) - The text says to use *more* pressure.
* **D: He iti iho te nekeneke matimati** (Less hand tension) - While relaxing your hands is good technique, the text doesn't connect it to increasing volume.



"
He aha i tapahia ai ngā rohe o ngā whakaahua i runga i te pouaka whakaata?,"The correct answer is **B: Nō reira ka whakakī te atahanga i te mata katoa** (So that the image fills the entire screen).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that televisions are made to appeal to the general public, and therefore the sides, top, bottom, and edges of everything visible are cropped ""so that the image fills the entire screen."" This is what's known as overscan or pan-and-scan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hei whakaae ki ngā taitararoto** (To accommodate subtitles) - While subtitles *can* be an issue with cropping, the primary reason given isn't to make space for them.
*   **C: Hei whakaae ki te tahuringa ngāwari ki ētahi atu hōputu** (To allow for easy conversion to other formats) - The passage doesn't mention anything about conversion to other formats.
*   **D: Hei tapahi i ngā taitararoto e tata rawa ana ki raro** (To cut off subtitles that are too close to the bottom) - This is a *consequence* of the cropping, not the reason *for* it.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tehea o ngā raruraru e whai ake nei ka kitea e te tangata ina hurihia he kiriata ki te hōputu DVD?","The correct answer is **A: He whakaahua kāore e whakakiia te mata katoa** (An image that doesn't fill the whole screen).

Here's why:

The passage directly states that TVs are made to be appealing to the general public, and as such, images are cropped on all sides (""ki ngā tahataha o ngā mea katoa""). This cropping is done to ensure the image fills the screen (""kia kapi te whakaahua i te katoa o te mata"").  When converting a movie to DVD, this cropping can happen again, potentially leading to parts of the image being cut off and *not* filling the whole screen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: tapahia tētahi wāhanga o ngā taitararoto** (a portion of the subtitles is cut off) - The passage *mentions* subtitles being cut off as a *result* of the cropping, but it doesn't identify this as the primary issue. It's a consequence of the main problem.
* **C: He atahanga e whakakī ana i te mata katoa** (An image that fills the whole screen) - This is the *opposite* of the problem described.
* **D: Tapahia ngā taitapa** (Cut edges) -  While edges are cropped, the main issue is that the image might not fill the screen, not just the act of cropping itself.



"
I hea tētahi Garrison Peretania?,"The correct answer is **C: Bordentown**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tianara John Cadwalder he ara autaki ki te puku tonu o ngā hoia o Ingarangi, ki **Bordentown** kia kore ai e riro anō i ā rātou he rawa."" (Cadwalder chose a route to strike the British troops at **Bordentown** to prevent them from regaining resources.)

Therefore, Bordentown is where a British garrison was located.



"
Ko wai te waitohu i puta mai i runga i te hukihuki tuhi ā-ringa?,"The correct answer is **D: Charles Thomson**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...a document commissioned and signed by the President of Congress John Hancock **and Secretary Charles Thompson** was sent to printer John Dunlap."" 

This clearly indicates Charles Thompson signed the document alongside John Hancock. The question asks who signed the *document* (the commission), not who printed it.



"
"I roto i ngā wāhi e whai ake nei, ko tēhea te wāhi whakamutunga i tae mai ai tētahi waka a Dunlap?","The correct answer is **C: London**.

The passage states: ""Ko he kape i tae he kape ki Rānana i te 10 o Akuhata."" (A copy arrived in London on August 10th.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: New York** - While a copy was read to Washington's troops in New York, that wasn't the *final* destination mentioned in the text.
*   **B: Te toa tā a John Dunlap** - The broadsides were *printed* by Dunlap, but weren't delivered *to* his shop as their final destination.
*   **D: Hōro Rangatiratanga** - (Independence Hall) - This is where the first public reading took place, not the final destination of a copy.



"
I whea nga hōia a Kānara Stark e noho ana?,"The correct answer is **D: I mua i te taiapa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I tū atu ā Stark tāngata ki te pahiko o te pito raki o te tūnga o te Colonist...I whakatū a Gridley, a Stark rānei i tētahi pou tata ki te 100 putu (30 m) **ki mua i te taiapa**...""  This directly states Stark's men positioned themselves *in front of* the breastwork.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I te pito ki te raki, i te taha o te taiapa** - While they were on the north end, the passage specifically says they were *in front of* it, not *beside* it.
*   **B: I runga i te one i te tapa o te wai** - The passage does mention the breastwork ending near the water, but doesn't say the soldiers were *on* the ground at the water's edge.
*   **C: Tae atu ki te raki-māraki o te Peninsula** - This is too broad. The passage focuses on their specific positioning related to the breastwork.



"
"E ai ki te whārangi nei, nō whea i whakawhānui ai ngā tangata a Stark i tō rātou taiepa?","The correct answer is **B: I muri i te putanga o nga auau i te tūnga**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I whakatū a Gridley, a Stark rānei i tētahi pou tata ki te 100 putu ki mua i te taiapa me te tohu kia kaua tētahi e pū i mua i te whakawhiti a ngā mea auau i a ia.""  This directly translates to ""Gridley or Stark set up a post about 100 feet in front of the breastwork and ordered no one to fire until the enemy passed him.""  This indicates they extended their breastwork *after* observing the enemy's advance (the ""auau"" - meaning enemy).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I te karangatanga a nga Hoa Mahi ki nga āwhina** - The passage doesn't mention a call for assistance.
*   **C: I te wa o te tai iti** - While the passage mentions low tide, it doesn't say they extended the breastwork *during* the low tide.
*   **D: Ahakoa i whakaaro nga hōia ki ngā tūnga whakamua** - The passage doesn't mention any consideration of forward positions in relation to extending the breastwork.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā wā e whai ake nei tētahi o ngā wā tino tutu o Haina?","The correct answer is **D: Ko nga rangatiratanga e toru (The Three Kingdoms)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ko te Three Kingdoms tētahi o ngā wā tino rere te toto i te hītori o Ancient China..."" which translates to ""The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ko te Jin Dynasty (The Jin Dynasty):** The passage states the Three Kingdoms period *was between* the Han and Jin Dynasties, not that it was a time of the Jin Dynasty itself.
*   **B: Te wa o Xi'an (The Xi'an period):** Xi'an is mentioned as the location of the imperial palace, but the passage doesn't identify the time *of* Xi'an as a particularly bloody period.
*   **C: Ko te Han Dynasty (The Han Dynasty):** The passage states the Three Kingdoms period was *after* the Han Dynasty, not that it was a time of the Han Dynasty itself.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te pono o te whenua taua e tomo ana ki tētahi wāhanga nomadic?","The correct answer is **C: Ka mahia e rātau he kōhanga kua hurihia i muri i te 17 rā.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ko ia o ēnei ekenga, hīkoinga tipiwhenua rānei, he āhua 17 rā te roa."" (Each of these settlements, or nomadic movements, is approximately 17 days long.)  This directly supports the idea that they establish a settlement for 17 days and then move on.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka kōhanga rātau i te pō** (They settle at night) - While they *move* at night, the passage doesn't say they *settle* specifically at night.
* **B: He iti noa iho ta rātau kai** (They have very little food) - The passage mentions food becoming available, but doesn't say they have *little* food.
* **D: E hīkoi ana rātau i te rā** (They walk during the day) - The passage explicitly states they walk at night (""ka hīkoikoi ngā hōia pōpokorua i te pō"").



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea kōrero e whakaatu tika ana i nga tikanga kōhanga o nga whenua taua i te wā o te wāhanga nomadic?","The correct answer is **D: Ka whakamahia e rātau ngā kōhanga ōrite mo te roanga o te wāhanga.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ko ia o ēnei ekenga, hīkoinga tipiwhenua rānei, he āhua 17 rā te roa."" (Each of these stages, or nomadic movements, is approximately 17 days long.) and ""Ka hangaia e te huinga ngā kōhanga taupua ka panonitia ia rā."" (The group creates sacred enclosures and organizes them each day).  This implies they are *using* enclosures for the duration of each 17-day stage of their journey.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E hanga ana rātau i ngā kōhanga i te pō** - While they move at night, the passage says they *create* the enclosures and *organize them each day*, not just build them at night.
* **B: E haere ana rātau mo te 17 rā, kaore he kōhanga** - This contradicts the passage which explicitly states they *create* enclosures.
* **C: Ka hurihia e rātau ngā kōhanga ia rā** - The passage says they *organize* them each day, not *change* them daily.  Organizing could mean maintaining, improving, or adjusting within a given enclosure.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ka haere tonu ahakoa ngā tohu o waho?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngā karaka koiora** (Biological clocks).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko ngā karaka koiora he mea ngapu kei te tautīnei i a rātou anō ka haere tonu te wā o te huringa rere noa ahakoa kei te ngaro ngā tohu nō waho.""  This translates to: ""Biological clocks are powerful in regulating themselves and the time of cyclical change continues even if the external signs disappear.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā huringa mutungakore** (Irregular changes) - The passage discusses *cyclical* changes, not irregular ones.
* **B: Ngā rangi auau** (Cloudy days) - This is a specific external sign and doesn't relate to internal regulation.
* **D: Ngā rangi i kitea** (Visible signs) - The passage specifically states that these *disappear* while the internal process continues.



"
He aha te kupu e whakaahua ana i ngā tāngata e whakaatu ana i ngā rerekētanga o tētahi āhuatanga phenotypic?,"The correct answer is **D: Polymorphic**.

Here's why:

* **The passage defines a population as having a unifying characteristic.** It then specifically states that when a human trait is widely variable, it's a *polymorphism*. This directly links variability in a trait to the term ""polymorphic.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Monomorphic:** This means *having only one form* of a trait, the opposite of what the passage describes when discussing variation.
* **B: Ngā Rauropi (Populations):** While the passage *discusses* populations, it's asking for the term that describes *variation within* a population, not the population itself.
* **C: Nga momo (Types):** This is too general.  ""Polymorphic"" is the specific scientific term for multiple forms of a trait within a population.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kupu e tika ana mō ngā rauropi e noho ana i tētahi wāhi motuhake?,"The correct answer is **D: Polymorphic**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ka kite ana i tētahi momo a te tangata e kitea whānuitia ana, he iranga tūātinitini tēnā."" (When a type of person is found widely, that is a polymorphic variation.) This directly links ""polymorphic"" to variations *within* a population.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Monomorphic:**  Means having only one form. The passage describes variations, not a single form.
* **B: Iwi Whānui:**  This translates to ""large tribe"" or ""general population"" - while related to populations, it doesn't specifically address the *variety* within them.
* **C: Nga momo:** This simply means ""types"" or ""kinds"" and is too general.  The passage is looking for a specific term to describe these variations.



Therefore, **polymorphic** best fits the definition provided in the passage for variations within a population."
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te tauira o tētahi mahi tūruhi e hāngai ana ki te taiao?,"The correct answer is **B: whakaahua i ngā kaimāori (photographing locals)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on ecotourism – activities centered around experiencing and learning about the *natural environment* (plants, animals, landscapes).** The examples given (bird watching, landscape viewing, learning about orangutans) all directly relate to nature.

Let's look at why the other options *are* related:

* **A: E tatari ana ki te mate wai (Waiting for the tide to go out)** - This is related to the ocean environment and potentially collecting seafood (a natural resource).
* **C: Haere ana ki tētahi whare taonga pūtaiao (Visiting a science museum)** - While not *in* nature, a science museum often focuses on understanding the natural world.
* **D: Rere hī ika (Spearfishing)** -  This is a direct interaction with the marine environment and its creatures.

Photographing locals, while potentially part of a trip, doesn't inherently focus on the natural environment, which is the core of the passage's discussion of ecotourism. It's more about cultural tourism.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei te take o te pūnaha waka?","The correct answer is **A: ūnga mahi (commuting/work trips)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ia ata, ka wehewehe ngā tāngata i ngā tāone iti ki taiwhenua ki ngā waka ki te haere ki tō rātou wāhi mahi..."" (Every morning, people from small towns travel by vehicle to their workplaces...) This directly identifies the purpose of the transport system as facilitating commutes to work.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngā motokā tūmataiti (Small cars):** While the passage mentions a system *related to* small cars, it doesn't state that the cars *are* the reason for the system.  It's a component *of* a larger system designed for a purpose.
* **C: He ao koiora pūmau (A sustainable living world):** While a positive outcome *could* be sustainability, the passage doesn't present this as the initial reason for the system.
* **D: kunenga tangata (population gathering):** The passage focuses on movement *to* work, not simply gathering people.



"
He aha te momo utu o ngā matūriki e karapoti ana i te karihi?,"The correct answer is **D: Utu tōrunga, tōraro hoki**.

Here's why:

The text states:

*   ""He whana hiko tōrunga tō te iraoho..."" (The protons have a positive charge...)
*   ""...karekau he whana tō te iramoe."" (The neutrons have no charge.)
*   ""He tōraro te whana hiko iriiho."" (The electrons have a negative charge.)

Therefore, the nucleus (the core of the atom, comprised of protons and neutrons) is made up of both positively and negatively charged particles."
Ko tehea matūriki te tito o te karihi?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngā Protons, ngā neutron, me ngā irahiko** (Protons, neutrons, and electrons).

Here's why:

The text states: ""ko ia tētahi karihi pū, e āhua rite ana ki te āmio a ngā aorangi i te rā"" (it is a nucleus, behaving like the sun's core) and then specifically mentions ""ngā iramoe me ngā iraoho"" (neutrons and protons) as the two constituents of the nucleus. It also states ""e āhua rite ana ki te āmio a ngā aorangi i te rā - tirohia Hoahoa 1.1"" (behaving like the sun's core - see Diagram 1.1), implying the electrons orbit the nucleus.

Therefore, the nucleus (karihi) is made up of protons and neutrons, and the atom as a whole includes electrons.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he tauira o tētahi tau taurangi e rima ngā moka?","The passage states that a binary digit can only have two values: 0 or 1.  A binary number is therefore composed of only 0s and 1s.

Let's examine the options:

*   **A: 1010** - Contains only 0s and 1s.
*   **B: 12001** - Contains a '2', which is not a binary digit.
*   **C: 10010** - Contains only 0s and 1s.
*   **D: 110101** - Contains only 0s and 1s.

The question asks for a *five-digit* binary number.

*   A: 1010 - 4 digits
*   C: 10010 - 5 digits
*   D: 110101 - 6 digits

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 10010**.



"
He aha hoki te ingoa o ngā mati taurangi?,"The correct answer is **A: Moka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ā, e kīia ana ēnei tau hei mati tāhūrua - **hei moka** rānei, kia whakamahia te kupu rorohiko.""  This directly translates to ""...and these bits are called binary digits - or **bits**, to use the computer term.""

Therefore, ""moka"" is the term used in the passage to refer to binary digits.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e kore e whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga hei painga matua o te rangitaki ākonga?,"The correct answer is **A: He whakapai ake i te āheitanga wetereo me te tuhituhi (Improving verbal ability and writing)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on *writing* skills development through peer review (rangitaki).** While improving writing is a direct result, it doesn't explicitly state that *verbal ability* is improved. The text concentrates on how peer review enhances writing through addressing concerns about audience reception and encouraging critical thinking about writing.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **B: He hekenga o te whakahē a nga hoa noho (Reduction of criticism from peers):** The passage states ""ka tīmata te kaituhi rangitaki ki te whai kia whakapai ake i te tuhinga hei karo i te whakahēnga"" - the writer begins to improve their work to *avoid* criticism.
* **C: He mōhiotanga whakawhānui ki ngā karapoti (Expanded knowledge of concepts):**  ""e tuku ai ngā ākonga te mōhio ake mō te ao e noho nei rātou"" - peer review allows students to learn more about the world around them.
* **D: He nui ake te hiahia mo te ako haere tonu (Increased desire for lifelong learning):**  ""...akiaki i ngā ākonga kia whāroa ake te ako i tua atu i tētahi rangi noa i te kura"" - peer review encourages students to learn beyond the classroom.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā āhuatanga e whai ake nei o te rangitaki e whakahuatia ana hei akiaki mō ngā ākonga ki te whakapai ake i ō rātou pūkenga tuhituhi?,"The correct answer is **B: Te tohe kia karo i te whakahē** (The desire to avoid criticism).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nā te mea he nui te wā ko ngā ākonga te minenga tino whakahē, ka tīmata te kaituhi rangitaki ki te whai kia whakapai ake i te tuhinga hei karo i te whakahēnga."" This directly translates to: ""Because students are often the most critical audience, the writer begins to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E urupare auau ana ki ngā rauemi i runga i te ipurangi** (Frequently using online resources) - While the passage *mentions* online features, it doesn't state this is the primary driver for improvement.
* **C: E pupuri ana i te painga o to rātau hunga whakarongo** (Maintaining the benefit of their audience) - The passage focuses on avoiding *criticism* from the audience, not simply benefiting them.
* **D: Te hiahiatanga o te Ngātahitanga** (The interaction of Collaboration) -  Collaboration is mentioned as a *result* of peer review (""he rauemi te rangitaki e whakaaweawe ai i te mahi tahi""), but not the initial motivator for improving writing skills.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai hua ana i te whakawhitiwhiti kōrero asynchronous mō ngā ākonga? ,"The correct answer is **A: Ko te whakamahinga o te ipurangi hei rauemi** (The use of the internet as a resource).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Mā te whakamahi i te Ipurangi, me te Tukutuku-Ao-Whānui e āhei ai ngā ākonga ki te āhei atu ki ngā mōhiohio i ngā wā katoa."" (By using the internet and the World Wide Web, students can access information at any time.) This directly links the benefits of asynchronous communication to internet resources.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Te uru kanohi ki te kanohi ki ngā kaiako i ngā wā katoa o te rā** (Face-to-face access to teachers at all times of the day) - Asynchronous communication *reduces* the need for constant face-to-face interaction. The passage highlights the benefit of *not* needing to wait for a face-to-face meeting.
* **C: Ngā hāora mahi ngāwari** (Flexible working hours) - While the passage mentions flexible hours as a benefit *for instructors*, it doesn't directly link this to student benefits from asynchronous communication.
* **D: Mana Pace** (Self-Paced Learning) - While asynchronous communication *allows* for self-paced learning, the passage doesn't explicitly state this as a *benefit* of the communication method itself.  It's a *result* of it, not the core benefit.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā aronga e whai ake nei o te whakawhitiwhitinga whakarihariha ehara i te mea māmā mō ngā ākonga?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā haora mahi (Working hours)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""he iti iho ngā here wā me te āheinga o te mahi i ngā hāora ā-mahi nekeneke"" (there are fewer time constraints and the ability to work during flexible hours). This implies that *flexible* working hours are a benefit of asynchronous communication.  The question asks what is *not* easy for students.  While flexible hours are beneficial, the passage doesn't suggest any difficulties *with* them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tere ako (Fast learning):** The passage implies faster responses (""wawe te whakahoki"") which supports faster learning.
* **C: Rauemi tohutohu (Instructional materials):** The passage states access to information is improved (""āhei atu ki ngā mōhiohio""), meaning instructional materials are more readily available.
* **D: Whakamahinga Ipurangi (Internet usage):** The passage explicitly mentions the benefits of using the internet (""Mā te whakamahi i te Ipurangi..."").



"
He aha te mea e kore e whakahuatia i roto i te whiti hei mea ka taea e te tangata te hono atu ki nga whare rangatira o mua?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā rua Dungeon (Dungeons)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions imagining the sounds of battle, hearing the clang of steel on stone, and feeling the fear growing in the ""rua poka"" (which translates to ""dark holes"" or, in this context, dungeons/caves used for imprisonment or as part of the castle's defenses).  The passage *asks* about what isn't described, seeking something that would help connect us to the castles of the past.  The passage *does* mention dungeons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngā Jousts (Jousts):** The passage specifically refers to ""whakataetae"" (competitions), which would include jousting.
* **C: Chivalry:** The passage references ""te hoahoatanga Arthurian"" (Arthurian design/imagery), which inherently includes the concept of chivalry.
* **D: Ngā Kōroa (Crowns):** While castles housed royalty, the passage doesn't focus on the symbols of royalty (like crowns) themselves; it focuses on the *structure* and *atmosphere* of the castles.



Therefore, **Ngā rua Dungeon** is the element *not* directly described in a way that helps the reader connect to the feeling of the castles, despite being mentioned."
"Ko tehea o ēnei e kore e whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga hei kakara, he haruru rānei e taea ana te whakahuatia i waenganui i ngā parekura o te whare?","The correct answer is **D: Hooves**.

Here's why:

The passage describes sounds and sensations within the ancient castle walls:

* **Ngā pakanga (Battles):** ""oro me ngā rongo o ngā pakanga"" - sounds and feelings of battles.
* **Wehi (Fear):** ""te rongo i te mataku e whanake haere ana"" - hearing the fear developing.
* **Hākari (Celebrations):** ""...ngā whakataetae, ngā hākari..."" - mentions competitions and celebrations.

However, there's *no* mention of the sound of **hooves** (D) within the castle walls. The passage focuses on sounds *within* the castle, not from outside (like horses).

Therefore, **D: Hooves** is the only option not described as a sound or sensation felt within the castle.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he whakaahuatanga tika o Kirby Muxloe Castle?,"The correct answer is **B: I hiahiatia he iti rawa te taiepa na te āhua rangimarie o te whenua i te wā i hangaia ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...he āhua maungārongo ki te whenua, ā, ka hiahiatia anake te whakawawao ki ngā rōpū iti o te hunga konihi e hāereere ana."" This translates to ""...a peaceful nature to the land, and only needed defense against small groups of wandering thieves."" This directly supports the idea that a large fortification wasn't necessary due to the peaceful surroundings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I tonoa nga pakitara mātotoru o te kōrere e te Lord Hastings:**  The passage mentions large windows and battlements, but doesn't specifically say Lord Hastings *ordered* thick walls.
* **C: Ehara te hanganga o te maka i te mea noa iho mo te wā kotahi:** The passage doesn't discuss the uniqueness of the construction in relation to its time.
* **D: I hangaia hei tautoko i ngā whakaekenga roa, whakatau hoki:** The passage explicitly states the opposite – it was built in a peaceful area and only needed to defend against small groups.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā āhuatanga hanga e whai ake nei e kiia ana ehara i te tikanga mo Kirby Muxloe Castle i te wā e whakaahuatia ana i te wāhanga?,"The correct answer is **B: He tūranga i hangaia hai tautoko i ngā whakaekenga (A stronghold built to withstand attacks)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states that Kirby Muxloe Castle, at its inception, was more of a *maungārongo ki te whenua* (harmonious with the land) and only needed defenses against *ngā rōpū iti o te hunga konihi* (small groups of thieves). This implies it wasn't built as a strong, fortified defense against large-scale attacks. 

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned or implied in the passage:

*   **A: Ngā matapihi nui (Large windows):** The passage explicitly states *Kaore e tino roa ka kore ngā matapihi nunui me ōna pakitara e taea te karo i te tomokanga mai* (It wouldn't be long before large windows and their bays could not be avoided from the entrance).
*   **C: He iti iho te whakawhāititanga i ētahi pātiki (Less imposing than some castles):** The description of it being ""harmonious with the land"" suggests it wasn't as intimidating as other castles.
*   **D: pakitara angiangi (Ornate bays):** Mentioned alongside the large windows in the passage.



Therefore, the passage does *not* support the idea that it was built as a *stronghold to withstand attacks*."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei te tino whai painga mo te kaioma e takatū ana mo te wā e tū mai nei?","The correct answer is **C: patupatu i te toru meneti**.

Here's why, based on the text (P):

* **The text emphasizes patience and endurance (""me ngaki te manawanui i ngā raru katoa"").**  Running a longer distance (""ko ngā oma roa"") and building strength (""mahi pītakataka mō runga ake o te tinana"") are presented as good ways to *prepare* for races, implying a focus on building a solid base rather than immediate speed.
* **The text specifically mentions a ""tāne e āhei te pīti i te rua miniti"" (a man who can run for two minutes), indicating that a certain level of stamina is already present.** This suggests the focus isn't on *developing* speed, but on sustaining effort.  The ""patupatu i te toru meneti"" (running three minutes) builds on this existing stamina.
* **The text downplays the importance of speed (""ka iti iho te hiranga o te tere"").**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Te whakangungu i te rere whenua i te raumati (Training for off-road running in the summer):**  The text doesn't mention off-road running or the season.
* **B: Te arotahi ki te whakawhanake i te tere i te wā e whakangungu ana (Focusing on developing speed while training):** The text explicitly says speed is *less important*.
* **D: E whakamahi ana i te whare tākaro ki te mahi i te tinana o runga (Using the gym to work the upper body):**  While upper body work is mentioned (""mahi pītakataka mō runga ake o te tinana""), it's framed as *part* of the preparation, not the primary focus.  The context implies endurance is more crucial.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he tino hiranga mo te kaioma haurua maero tuatahi?","The correct answer is **B: E whakaputa ana i te manawanui i runga i te tere** (Developing endurance over speed).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes:** ""ka iti iho te hiranga o te tere, ka noho mātua waiwai te manawa piharau"" (speed is less important, endurance is very valuable) and ""me ngaki te manawanui i ngā raru katoa"" (endurance must be developed in all difficulties).  This clearly points to the importance of endurance over pure speed for a first-time half marathon runner.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Te whakahaere i te rere whenua i ngā marama o te hotoke** (Managing terrain in the months of August) - The passage doesn't mention specific months or terrain management. It talks about long runs in winter (takurua) but not managing specific terrain.
* **C: E karaka ana i raro i te rua meneti** (Running under two minutes) - The passage mentions a runner who *can* complete it in two minutes, but doesn’t say it’s a goal or necessary for half marathon preparation.  It’s more of an example of someone who doesn’t prioritize speed.
* **D: Tere whakaputa i runga i te manawanui** (Developing speed over endurance) - This is the *opposite* of what the passage advocates.



"
"Mo te kaitākaro, ko tehea o ēnei e kore e taea te whakatutuki mā te kai anake?","The correct answer is **C: Mahinga Elite (Elite Performance)**.

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

The text states that skill isn't achieved *solely* through diet, but is also beneficial for the physical well-being of young people. It then links proper nutrition to *improved* training and the *ability to enjoy* sports more.  

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mahinga pai ake (Improved Performance):** The text directly supports that good nutrition leads to improved training and therefore performance.
* **B: Te nui ake o te hākinakina (Greater enjoyment of sport):**  The text explicitly states that good nutrition allows for greater enjoyment of sport.
* **D: Poka Ahuwhānui (Increased Endurance):** While not directly stated, increased endurance is a natural result of better physical well-being achieved through proper nutrition and training.

**Mahinga Elite (Elite Performance)** requires a combination of factors *beyond* just diet -  natural talent, rigorous training, coaching, mental fortitude, and consistent effort.  The text implies diet is *supportive* of performance, not the sole determinant of reaching an elite level.

"I runga anō i te wāhanga nei, ko tehea o ngā mea e whai ake nei e kore e tūtohutia hei huarahi kia nui ake ai te ahuareka o ngā kaitākaro taitamariki i a rātau hākinakina?","The correct answer is **C: He pai te whakamakuku (Proper hydration)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of *tika* (correct/proper) in all aspects of physical wellbeing.**  This includes *kai tika* (correct nutrition) and understanding how to strengthen the body.
* **The passage specifically mentions *inu wai tika* (drinking water correctly) as part of maintaining good health.** Proper hydration is crucial for performance and enjoyment.
* **While ""He pai te whakamakuku"" *sounds* like it could be about hydration, *whakamakuku* actually means ""to vomit"" or ""to be sick.""** This is obviously *not* a way to enhance enjoyment in sports.  It's the opposite!

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the passage:

* **A: Kei te whakamātau i te kai tika (Testing correct nutrition):** The passage directly states the importance of correct nutrition.
* **B: E tika ana te mahi i tētahi taumata rangatira (Working at a high level):**  The passage links proper training to increased enjoyment and ability.
* **D: Kei te pupuri i tētahi toenga pūngao hauora (Maintaining a healthy balance):**  The overall message is about holistic wellbeing.



Therefore, **C** is the only option that contradicts the passage's message about promoting enjoyment and wellbeing through *correct* practices."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha pea ka hokona e tētahi kaioma tawhiti he taonga utu nui ake?","The correct answer is **A: Ko tō rātou manakohanga whaiaro tēnei** (This is their psychological desire).

Here's why:

The passage states that some distance runners *feel* they would perform better with a more expensive piece of equipment, *even if no tangible benefit is seen*. This indicates the purchase isn't based on practical improvement (""kaore he hua tika ka kitea""), but on a feeling or psychological desire (""he pai ake rātou"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kua kitea e ia ngā painga** (They have seen the benefits) - The passage explicitly says no tangible benefits are seen.
* **C: Ka tino pā ki ta rātau mahinga** (It will significantly affect their performance) - Again, the passage states there's no *seen* effect on performance.
* **D: He whakaaro hē e pā ana ki ngā taputapu iti iho te utu** (A mistaken idea about less expensive equipment) - While the passage mentions the lower cost of distance running, it focuses on the *reason* for buying more expensive gear – not a misunderstanding about cheaper options.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te hiahia o te rere tawhiti o waenganui?","The correct answer is **C: Ngā taputapu iti rawa (Smallest tools)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...he nui ngā heitara mō ngā taputapu iti nei ka whakamahia mō tēnei mahi."" ( ""...many costs for the small tools used for this work."") This directly indicates a need or expense associated with small tools for long-distance running.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He nui nga taonga (Many possessions):** The passage doesn't focus on possessions in general, only the cost of *specific* tools.
* **B: He papamuri hakinakina kua whakatūria (An established sporting background):** This isn't mentioned in the passage at all.
* **D: He nui te moni (A lot of money):** While costs are mentioned, the focus is on the tools themselves, not just the money spent.



"
Na wai i kite i te whakaata autō ngota? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch me te Purcell**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""E hāngai ana te MRI ki te kaupapa ahupūngao e kīa ana ko te karihi aukume whāorooro, i tūhuratia e Felix Bloch (i te mahi ki Te Whare Wānanga o Stanford) me Edward Purcell (nō Te Whare Wānanga o Harvard) i ngā tau 1930.""  This translates to: ""MRI is related to the physics principle called nuclear magnetic resonance, discovered by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University) in the 1930s.""

This means Bloch and Purcell were the ones who discovered the phenomenon of nuclear magnetic resonance – the basis for seeing signals from atoms (and thus, seeing what's happening inside the body with MRI).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Purcell:** While Purcell was involved, it was a joint discovery.
*   **B: Damadian:** Damadian *applied* MRI to medical imaging, he didn't discover the underlying principle.
*   **D: Bloch me te Damadian:** Damadian's work came later, building on the discoveries of Bloch and Purcell.



"
He aha te tau i tukuna ai te ārai tuatahi mo te whakahoki atahanga rongoā? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""E whā tau ki muri ka tukuna tētahi raihana motuhake, koirā te raihana motuhake tuatahi o te ao i tukuna ki te mātai MRI.""  This translates to: ""Four years later a special patent was issued, which was the world's first patent issued for MRI scanning.""  It follows the statement that Damadian proposed using nuclear magnetic resonance for body imaging in 1970. Therefore, 1970 + 4 = 1974.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 1977** - This is the year Damadian completed the first full-body MRI scanner (""Indomitable""), not when the first patent was issued.
*   **C: 1930** - This is when Bloch and Purcell discovered the principle MRI is based on, not when a patent for its medical application was granted.
*   **D: 1970** - This is when Damadian *proposed* the idea, not when the patent was granted.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te tikanga kia kaha te mōhiotanga o te tangata kia whakamārama ai i nga mahi ōkiko a ētahi atu?","The correct answer is **B: whakaaro**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te tangata te momo tino iho pumanawa rawa i te mōhio ki ngā whakaaro o ētahi atu."" (People are uniquely gifted in understanding the thoughts of others.)  It then goes on to explain how understanding these ""whakaaro"" (thoughts) allows us to interpret actions. The entire passage revolves around the importance of *thinking* about what someone else might be thinking to correctly interpret their behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: hiahia (desire/wish):** While desires *influence* actions, the passage focuses on understanding the *thoughts* behind the actions, not just the desires themselves.
*   **C: Whakapono (belief):** Beliefs are part of thought, but the passage speaks more broadly about understanding the full range of someone's mental state.
*   **D: Whakaarotanga (judgment):**  While we make judgements, the passage argues that accurate judgement *depends* on understanding thoughts first. It's the thought process that leads to a good (or corrected) judgement.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ka āwhina te whakaaro mātauranga i te tangata ki te mahi i te aha?","The correct answer is **A: Whakakorea te kore mōhio i muri i ngā mahi ā-tinana (Reduce uncertainty behind physical actions)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that understanding others' perspectives (""te mārama ki te takunetanga o ētahi atu"") allows us to ""whakatau i ngā rangirua o ngā mahi ā-tinana"" (resolve the ambiguities of physical actions).  The example of the person trying to open a car door illustrates this – understanding *why* they are doing it (lost keys vs. theft) removes the uncertainty.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngā hiahia matapae (Predictive needs):** While understanding others *can* help predict, the passage focuses on *understanding* the reason *behind* an action, not just predicting future needs.
* **C: Tirohia ētahi atu tangata me te kore whakawā (Observe others without judgment):** The passage isn’t about avoiding judgement, but about having enough information to make an *informed* judgement.  It acknowledges initial assumptions (like thinking someone is stealing) which *are* judgements.
* **D: Pānuitia nga hinengaro o ētahi atu (Read the minds of others):** The passage talks about *understanding* perspectives, not literally reading minds. It emphasizes inferring reasons based on observation and context.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he whakarāpopoto tika o te take matua o AI?","The correct answer is **D: Aunoatanga tūmahi (Automation of tasks)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kei roto i te rangahau atamai horihori te hanga mīhini kia **whakangāwari i ngā mahi** e hiahia ana ki te whanonga atamai."" (Within artificial intelligence research is the creation of machines to **simplify the tasks** that require intelligent methods.)

This directly points to the core purpose of AI being the automation of tasks – making machines capable of performing tasks that usually require human intelligence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Whakarite (Planning)** - While planning *is* an example of an AI capability mentioned, it's not the overarching purpose.
*   **B: Āhukahuka reo (Language processing)** -  Language processing is a *part* of AI, but not the central goal.
*   **C: Kei te whakarite (Is planning)** - Similar to A, it's an example, not the core purpose.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e pāhono ana ki te AI?","The correct answer is **B: Whakarite me te whakarite (Scheduling and planning)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""te whakahaere, te whakamahere me te whakarite wā"" (management, planning and scheduling) as examples of tasks that fall under artificial intelligence (AI) research. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ratonga kiritaki (Customer service):** While AI *can* be used for customer service (like chatbots), the passage doesn't specifically highlight it as a core AI function. It mentions the *ability to answer questions* which is related, but scheduling/planning is directly listed.
*   **C: Pūtaiao pakimaero (Aerospace science):** The passage mentions AI being used in defense (""tauā""), but doesn't specifically tie it to aerospace science.
*   **D: Āhuka tuhiāringa (Handwriting recognition):** The passage does mention handwriting recognition as an ability AI is developing (""mōhiotanga o te tuhi ā-ringa""), but scheduling and planning is more central to the description of AI research.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he kaha o tētahi tangata whai tauira whakaaro ūngutu?","The correct answer is **D: Ngā tauira Memorizing** (Memorizing patterns).

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ko te hunga e pēnei nei ō rātou whakaaro he whakaaro whakakaupapa ōna, e taea nei te maumahara ki ngā tauira..."" (Those who think like this have a structured thought process, *can remember patterns*...).
* The passage emphasizes a single correct answer and a systematic approach, aligning with recognizing and applying learned patterns.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Te tautuhi i ngā whakautu tika maha ki tētahi raruraru** (Identifying multiple correct answers to a problem): The passage specifically says there is *only one* correct answer.
* **B: Te whakamahi i ngā tikanga hou ki tētahi raruraru** (Using new methods to solve a problem): While adaptation is mentioned, the core is applying existing frameworks and patterns, not necessarily inventing new ones.
* **C: Te whai wā ki te whakaoti i ngā raruraru** (Taking time to solve problems): Speed (""te tere"") is mentioned as a focus of this type of thinking, implying efficiency rather than just spending time.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tehea o nga mea e whai ake nei kare e kiia ko te aronga o te whakaaro huritao?","The correct answer is **B: Kei te mau i te wā kotahi** (It is happening simultaneously/at the same time).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the focus of this type of thinking is:

*   **tere** (speed)
*   **whakakaupapa** (systematic/organized)
*   **tika** (accuracy)
*   **tautuhi i ngā meka** (identifying mechanisms)
*   **whakahāngai anō i ngā tikanga o nāianei** (adapting existing methods)
*   **kohi mōhiohio** (collecting information)

While speed might *imply* things happening quickly, the passage doesn’t specifically state ""happening simultaneously"" as a core focus. The other options are directly mentioned: accuracy (tika), identifying causes (tautuhi i ngā meka relates to understanding causes), and collecting information (kohi mōhiohio).



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e kore e whakaarotia he pēhi moroiti?","The correct answer is **B: E whakangao ana i te rae (Frowning)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses *microexpressions* – fleeting facial movements. It specifically mentions how these can reveal if someone is lying, and how people with speech difficulties can still understand *internal states* through these subtle cues. The passage highlights:

*   **Glancing:** This *is* a microexpression.
*   **Rapid association:** This refers to the speed at which these expressions happen, a characteristic of microexpressions.
*   **Conveying meaning:** Microexpressions *do* convey meaning.

However, **frowning** is a more sustained facial expression. While it *can* be part of a microexpression sequence, it's not a microexpression itself. It's a longer-duration expression of emotion.

Therefore, frowning is the one that doesn’t fit the definition of a microexpression as described in the passage.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā tauākī e whai ake nei e pā ana ki te whakamāramatanga pēhi moroiti ehara i te tika?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka kitea pea e te whakamāramatanga tika te teka**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ka taea te kite mēnā kei te rūkahu tētahi tangata mā te whakamārama tika i ngā ihiihi paku rawa."" (You can tell if someone is lying by directly interpreting microexpressions). This directly implies that direct interpretation isn't *always* accurate – someone *could* be falsely accused of lying.  The phrase ""ka kitea pea"" (can be seen) introduces a possibility, not a certainty.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nā ngā hopukanga ataata i puta ai ki ngā kōkiri nui (Video captures led to major breakthroughs):** While the passage mentions video use, it's about *interpreting* the videos, not the captures themselves being breakthroughs.
* **C: Ka whakamāramatia te kōrero me ngā kīanga kanohi (Speech is interpreted with facial expressions):** The passage talks about interpreting *microexpressions* specifically, not all facial expressions as a general accompaniment to speech.
* **D: Ka taea te āwhina ki te aromatawai i te pono (It can help assess truthfulness):** The passage *suggests* this, but it also implicitly warns that it's not foolproof. Option B is a more nuanced and accurate reflection of the passage's message.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei mea e whai ake nei i tino hira i te mutunga o te Renaissance? ,"The correct answer is **B: E whakaputa ana i te mātauranga (Dissemination of knowledge)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states the Renaissance brought a ""panoni hira ki te aronga ki te ako, me te hōrapa o te mātauranga"" – a strong focus on learning *and the spread of knowledge*.  This directly links to the idea of knowledge being disseminated (spread widely).

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: auporo takitahi (individual scholarship)** - While individual scholarship *was* part of the Renaissance, the passage emphasizes the *spreading* of knowledge more strongly.
*   **C: auporo kuputuhi (literacy rates)** - Increased literacy helped with dissemination, but wasn’t the core outcome *of* the Renaissance. It was a contributing factor.
*   **D: Kei te whiwhi mōhiohio (acquiring knowledge)** - While people were acquiring knowledge, the passage focuses on what happened *because* of this increased focus – the spread of that knowledge.



Therefore, the dissemination (hōrapa) of knowledge is the most direct and significant outcome of the Renaissance mentioned in the text."
"I te mutunga o te Renaissance, he iti ake te arotahi ki tehea o ngā mea e whai ake nei?","The correct answer is **A: auporo takitahi (individual scholarship)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that before the Renaissance, knowledge was largely held and relied upon the memory of *individuals* (""i mutu kau noa te pēhitanga i roto i te mahara o te tangata kotahi""). The Renaissance brought a shift *away* from that, towards a broader dissemination of knowledge (""me te hōrapa o te mātauranga"").  Therefore, the Renaissance resulted in *less* focus on individual scholarship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kei te whiwhi i te mātauranga (acquiring knowledge):** The Renaissance *increased* focus on acquiring knowledge.
* **C: auporo kuputuhi (literary scholarship):**  The Renaissance promoted literacy and therefore literary scholarship.
* **D: Tuaritanga o te mōhiohio (description of knowledge):** The Renaissance fostered a broader description and understanding of knowledge.

Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e kore e whakaatu i te kaupapa ki te whakamahi i te ipurangi mō te haere tonu o ngā hononga?,"The correct answer is **A: Whatunga pakihi (Business networking)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses how the internet is blending physical communities with emotional connections. It specifically mentions concepts like ""social presence"" and ""relational maintenance"" as new aspects of online interaction.  The examples given (learning, entertainment) and the idea of maintaining relationships all point to *personal* connections.

* **B: Kei te whakapā tonu ki te whānau (Staying in touch with family)** directly relates to maintaining relationships.
* **C: Haere rangahau (Conducting research)** can involve online communities and interaction.
* **D: Hui i ngā tāngata hōu (Meeting new people)** is about forming new connections.

**Whatunga pakihi (Business networking)**, while *using* the internet, isn't primarily about the emotional, relational aspects highlighted in the passage. It's transactional and professional, focusing on career advancement rather than deeper connection.  Therefore, it doesn't fit the passage's focus on the internet's role in fostering *ongoing relationships*.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore e whakaatu i te kaupapa ki te whakamahi i te ipurangi mō te whai wāhi whaiaro?,"The correct answer is **D: Whakahaere moni ana (Managing finances)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses motivations for using the internet related to *social interaction and psychological needs*. It specifically mentions things like:

*   **""ako"" (learning)**
*   **""pāhekoheko"" (entertainment)**
*   **""whakauru takitahi"" (individual involvement)**
*   **""tōai whanaungatanga"" (relationship building)**

Let's look at why the other options *do* relate to the passage's theme:

*   **A: Tirohia ana he tohutohu (Looking up information)** - Learning is specifically mentioned.
*   **B: Tuku ana i runga i tētahi papa matapakinga tuihono (Posting on a social media platform)** - Directly relates to social interaction and relationship building.
*   **C: Rangahau ana i ngā hua rongoā (Researching medical products)** - Could be linked to learning or seeking information, which aligns with the passage.

**Whakahaere moni ana (Managing finances)**, however, is a practical task, not a socially or psychologically motivated one. It doesn't fit the themes discussed in the provided text.



"
"Nō whea i mutu ai te whakawhirinaki nui o Ūropi ki ngā pānga, a, ka tīmata te whakawhanake i tōna ake kāhua?","The correct answer is **A: Puta noa i te mutunga o ngā Pakeke o Waenganui** (Towards the end of the Middle Ages).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""…tata ki te mutunga o ngā Middle Ages i tīmata a Ūropi ki te uru te whakawhanake i tā rātou ake huatau."" (…towards the end of the Middle Ages, Europe began to develop their own style). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I te wā o te wā o Byzantine** – The passage states Gothic style *initially* was influenced by Byzantine culture, but doesn’t say Europe stopped relying on external influence *during* that time.
* **C: Tata ki te 25 tau i muri i nga Pakeke o Waenganui** – The passage mentions a 25-30 year lag in trends traveling west, but this isn't when Europe started developing its *own* style.
* **D: I te rau tau 11** – The passage mentions the 10th-11th centuries as the *origin* of the Gothic style, not when Europe started to move away from external influences.



"
He aha te hua o te whakamahi i ngā pātene hei whakapiri i ngā kakahu? ,"The correct answer is **D: Ngā Pakeke o Waenganui (The Middle Ages)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""…tatata ki te mutunga o ngā Middle Ages i tīmata a Ūropi ki te uru te whakawhanake i tā rātou ake huatau. ko tētahi o ngā whanaketanga nui rawa o te wā i hua mai i ngā ekenga ka tīmata ngā tāngata ki te whakamahi pātene hei whakamau kākahu.""  This directly links the use of buttons as fasteners to the *end* of the Middle Ages and a development *within* that period.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te wā Gothic (The Gothic Period):** While the passage discusses the Gothic period, it says buttons came into use *towards the end* of the Middle Ages, not that they *define* the Gothic period.
*   **B: Te wā o Byzantine (The Byzantine Period):** The passage states Gothic style was *initially influenced* by Byzantine culture, but buttons weren't a feature of that early influence.
*   **C: The Crusades:** The passage mentions communication exchanges (which the Crusades facilitated), but doesn't directly link the Crusades *to* the invention or widespread use of buttons.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e whakaarotia ana he rongoā wā roa ki ngā take taiao?","The correct answer is **B: Whakakotahitanga (Unity/Solidarity)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ka taea e tātou te tūhono ki te kotahitanga mō te taiao..."" (we can connect to unity for the environment).  It frames this unity as a way to become ""guardians to make a flourishing future"". This strongly suggests the author views unity as a core, long-term solution.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ngā kōwhiringa āhua noho tāpiri (Additional lifestyle choices):** While the passage mentions living better with nature, it doesn't position *just* lifestyle changes as the *long-term solution*. It's more of a starting point.
*   **C: E whakaatu ana i te take o ngā take (Showing the cause of the issues):** The passage *acknowledges* the causes of the problems (human scientific and technological actions) but doesn't say identifying them *is* the solution.  It says we need to find the ""root of the problems"" and eliminate them.
*   **D: E tū mai ana he urunga o te nekeneke taiao (Standing up as a link of environmental change):**  This is a bit vague and doesn't capture the proactive, collective action implied by the passage's emphasis on unity.



Therefore, **Whakakotahitanga (B)** best reflects the passage's idea of a lasting solution to environmental issues."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tehea o enei otinga e kore e kiia he maimoatanga tohu mo nga take taiao?","The correct answer is **C: Ngā whakaaro pōti mō ngā kōwhiringa āhua noho tāpiri** (Voting ideas for additional lifestyle choices).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes *proactive* solutions:

* **Starting to live better with nature:** (Te tīmata ki te noho pai ake me te taiao) - This is a direct action.
* **Addressing the root causes of problems:** (Me rapu tātou i te aka o ngā raru, ā, me whakakore e tātou) - This speaks to preventative action.
* **Living in a way that is better for the environment:** (Te noho i roto i tētahi huarahi pai ake mō te taiao) - Another direct action.
* **Being a guardian to make the future better:** (Te tū hei kaiwhakatūtū kia āhua whakahiki i te pākatokato hei te wā e heke mai ana) - Proactive stewardship.

Voting for lifestyle choices (C) is a *reactive* measure – it relies on others to implement change. While important, the passage frames the need for direct action and tackling the core issues, not simply expressing preference through voting.  The passage describes a need for ""rongoā taupua"" (curative medicine/solutions) and identifying/eliminating the ""aka"" (root) of problems, not just hoping for better outcomes through voting.

"I roto i tehea whenua i puta ai te pakanga tuatahi i Uropi e kiia ana ko te take matua e pā ana ki te ōritetanga o te mana, kaua ki te take karakia?","The correct answer is **D: Pāniora** (Spain).

Here's why, based on the provided text:

The text states: ""Ko te War of Spanish Succession te pakanga tuatahi ko te take matua ko te taurite o te mana.""  This translates to ""The War of Spanish Succession was the first war whose main cause was the balance of power."" The War of Spanish Succession *concerned* the Spanish throne and succession, making Spain the key country involved in the first war driven by the balance of power, not religious reasons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ingarangi (England):** While England *participated* in the War of Spanish Succession, the war wasn't *about* something happening *in* England.
*   **B: Tiamana (Germany):** Germany was also involved, but the core issue was the Spanish throne.
*   **C: Portugal:** Portugal was involved but not the central focus of the conflict regarding the balance of power.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tēhea rohe te mea pai rawa atu mō tētahi rā takutai marino?","The correct answer is **D: Waitemata Harbor**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kei te Pūahatanga Waitemata ngā taha moana o Tamaki Drive, ki ngā wāhi tāone whai rawa o Mission Bay me St Heliers ki te pito o Tāmaki Makaurau.""  This translates to ""The shores of Tamaki Drive, to the wealthy urban areas of Mission Bay and St Heliers at the end of Auckland, are in the Waitemata Harbour.""

The passage also mentions the harbor has many safe beaches, often shaded by pōhutukawa trees, and is a safe swimming spot.  While Mission Bay and St Heliers are *within* Waitemata Harbour, the harbour itself is the broader area described as being good for swimming.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Huarahi Heliers (Heliers Bay Road)** - This is a specific location *within* Waitemata Harbour, not the broader best area.
*   **B: Te Whenua o Te Mihana (Mission Bay)** - Same as above, a specific location within the harbour.
*   **C: Te Takiwa o Harbor ki te Raki (Harbour area to the North)** - The passage describes the coastline from Long Bay to Devonport, which is a part of the harbour but doesn't encompass the entirety of what’s described as safe and appealing for swimming.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, kei hea ngā āhuatanga kaukau e tino haumaru ana?","The correct answer is **A: Devonport**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko ngā takutai ki Te Raki Paewhenua (kei Te Whanganui a Toi) kei Te Moana nui a Kiwa, e toro ana mai i **Long Bay ki Devonport**. Ko te nuinga o ngā moana haumaru nei, ā, ko te nuinga hoki kua whakamarua e te rākau pōhutukawa.""

This directly identifies the coastline stretching from Long Bay *to Devonport* as being safe, and sheltered by pōhutukawa trees.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Takiwā Harbor ki te Raki:** While Devonport is in the northern harbor, this option is too broad.
*   **C: Ākarana Waenga:**  The passage mentions the central isthmus of Auckland (Tāmaki) but doesn't specifically highlight it as particularly safe for swimming.
*   **D: Te Moana Roa:** This means ""the great ocean"" and refers to the wider Pacific, not the sheltered harbors discussed in the passage.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a concentration camp.** The detail about ""structures"" and the location being marked and easy to navigate *within* those structures is a key indicator.  The description emphasizes the physical environment of the camp.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Whakatau nui (Big decision):** The passage focuses on a *place*, not a decision.
    * **B: Kei te mahue i tētahi tohu ki tētahi wāhi huri noa i te pae (Missing a sign somewhere around the perimeter):**  While there might be signs, the passage doesn't highlight that. It focuses on the internal layout and overwhelming scale.
    * **C: Te hanga whakakata (Building a joke/mockery):**  This is entirely inappropriate given the gravity of the situation described (the Holocaust).



The passage's emphasis on structures, markings, and navigating the area strongly suggests someone is *looking at* the buildings and infrastructure of the concentration camp."
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whakamārama ana i ngā reo lingua francas?,"The correct answer is **C: Kua Whakaritea (Defined/Established)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""he reo kua whanake noa mai, puta noa rānei ēnei ka tuanui ai i runga i tētahi take hei tikanga mō te whakawhitinga kōrero i waenganui i ngā kaikōrero o ētahi atu reo"" -  ""a language that has developed, or these that grow on a basis as a means for communication between speakers of other languages.""  This describes a language *defined* or *established* for the purpose of communication, which is the core of a lingua franca.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hori (Bad/Evil):** This has no connection to the definition of a lingua franca.
* **B: Kāore i te mōhiotia (Not known):** The passage *does* explain lingua francas.
* **D: Waro (Rubbish/Useless):** Lingua francas are, in fact, *useful* for communication.



"
Ko tēhea tauākī kāore e whakaahua tika ana i ngā reo tūturu?,"The correct answer is **A: He reo tūturu ēnei e whakamahia ana hei māmā ake i te whakawhitiwhiti kōrero i waenganui i ngā tāngata kāore pea e mārama ki a rātou anō.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly contrasts auxiliary/constructed languages with *natural* languages.**  It states the difficulty of communication with natural languages, implying auxiliary/constructed languages are designed to *overcome* that difficulty.  Option A describes auxiliary/constructed languages as simplifying communication for those who don't share a natural language – which aligns directly with the passage’s point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He reo rātau, he māori, he mea hanga rānei:** This just lists types of languages (natural, indigenous, constructed) but doesn't describe what auxiliary/constructed languages *are*.
* **C: He reo hanganga hei whakapai ake i ngā tauari whakawhiti kōrero uaua:** While true, this describes *how* they function, but doesn't define what they *are* in relation to natural languages.
* **D: Kua waihangatia he reo kaha i waenganui i ngā tukuoro o ngā reo rerekē:** This is a characteristic of auxiliary languages, but it doesn’t directly address the *core difference* between them and natural languages.



**In essence, the question asks which option doesn't describe the fundamental *purpose* of auxiliary/constructed languages as presented in the passage.**  Option A does this best by positioning them as a solution to the difficulties posed by natural languages."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, me aha te tirohanga pāhihi mehemea kai te hōtoke to rātau tere?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā whakaritenga visa** (Visa requirements).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Kei roto i ngā rerenga Saint Petersburg he wā ki rō tāone. Kei te wātea ngā pāhihi rerenga i ngā herenga pane uruwhenua (tirohia ngā herenga).""  This translates to ""...Flights from Saint Petersburg may require a transit visa in the city. Flight details are available on immigration websites (see links).""

This directly indicates that if you have a layover, you need to check visa requirements.  The other options aren't relevant to the passage's focus on potential visa needs during a layover.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, mehemea kai te raumati te tere o te pāhihi, he aha pea ka taea e rātau te karo?","The correct answer is **B: E haere ana i te hukapapa (Going through the rapids)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that traveling *through the rapids* is of interest to those affected by a certain illness.  The question asks what they might avoid if the ferry is fast during summer.  A fast ferry would likely *avoid* the rapids, thus avoiding the experience sought by those with the illness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wā i te taone (Time in town):**  The passage mentions time in town, but doesn't connect it to avoiding something.
*   **C: Ngā whakaritenga visa (Visa requirements):** Visa requirements aren't mentioned as something to avoid based on ferry speed.
*   **D: Saint Petersburg:** Saint Petersburg is a destination, not something to avoid.



"
He aha te take i whakamahia ai te reo Catalan i te nuinga o te wā mō ngā tohu me ngā panui i Barcelona?,"The correct answer is **B: Ko te reo mana tuatahi tērā o te taone** (It is the first official language of the city).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kua whakaūngia e te ture koirā te reo ōkawa tuatahi"" (it has been established by law that this is the first official language). This directly supports the answer that Catalan is the first official language and therefore used on signage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He nui ake te mārama i te Spanish** (More people understand Spanish) - The passage says almost everyone understands Catalan and almost everyone knows Spanish. While more *may* understand Spanish, this isn’t the reason for the official signage.
*   **C: Ko te reo manako tēnei i Barcelona** (This is the preferred language in Barcelona) - The passage doesn't state preference, only legal requirement.
*   **D: Ko te Metro me ētahi atu whare tūmatanui he nuinga o ngā tangata e kōrero Catalan** (The Metro and other public places have many people who speak Catalan) - While this might be true, it’s not the *reason* Catalan is used on signage – it's the law.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā reo e whai ake nei e whakamahia ana e te pūnaha Metro o Barcelona mō ngā panui auau?,"The correct answer is **B: Catalan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ko ngā pānui auau i te Metro e mahi noa ana ki Catalan"" which translates to ""The announcements on the Metro are only in Catalan."" 

While the system *offers* translations via a machine in several languages (including English, Spanish, etc.), the initial announcements themselves are *only* in Catalan.



"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, ko tēhea o ngā taonga e whai ake nei e kore pea e whakaritea e te moenga mutunga tiketike me te parakuihi?","The correct answer is **C: Kia mau tonu ngā mokowā o waho (Maintaining exterior moisture)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the *presentation* of luxury and quality in B&Bs. It highlights things like high-quality bedding, gourmet food, beautiful surroundings (gardens, pools), and potentially historic features.  

* **A: Ngā tuemi tahua motuhake (Special financial contributions)** - Not mentioned in the passage.
* **B: Ngā whakarato ārai motuhake (Special cleaning provisions)** -  While cleanliness is *implied* by quality, special cleaning provisions aren't specifically highlighted as a defining feature of luxury.
* **C: Kia mau tonu ngā mokowā o waho (Maintaining exterior moisture)** - This is about building maintenance and isn't a feature designed to *enhance the guest experience* in the way the other options are.  It's a practical concern, not a luxury amenity.
* **D: WiFi Tere (Fast WiFi)** - While not explicitly mentioned, fast WiFi is becoming increasingly expected in accommodations, especially those aiming for a higher-end experience.  It would fit with the focus on quality and comfort.

The passage is about *what guests see and experience*.  Keeping the outside of the building dry is important for the building itself, but it doesn't contribute to the luxurious *feeling* the B&B is trying to create.



"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, ko tēhea o ēnei ehara i tētahi o ngā wāhi matua o te whakataetae i waenganui i ngā B&Bs rangatira?","The correct answer is **A: Te whakapaipai o naianei (Current decor)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the key competitive elements for high-end B&Bs:

*   **Bedding quality:** ""moenga me te parakuihi tino kounga"" (high quality beds and breakfast)
*   **Breakfast quality:** ""kai reka o te wā nō te rohe, ko te kai motuhake o te hunga kāinga"" (local delicacies or unique homemade food)
*   **Ambiance/Setting:** ""wāhi tawhito nei ngā whare me ōna nohoanga tawhito hoki, ko ngā papa e ātaahua ana, me tētahi puna kaukau"" (old buildings with traditional furnishings, beautiful gardens, and a swimming pool).

While décor (te whakapaipai) *contributes* to ambiance, it isn't specifically highlighted as a major competitive factor *in the same way* as the quality of the bed, breakfast, and overall setting are.  The passage discusses *what* makes a setting special (old buildings, gardens, pools), not the *style* of decorating those spaces.

Let's look at why the other options are relevant:

*   **B: He awhe o ngā whakahere parakuihi tau (A range of seasonal breakfast options)** - This directly relates to the emphasis on breakfast quality and local/unique food.
*   **C: Puri mutunga tiketike (Luxurious linens)** - This directly relates to the emphasis on bedding quality.
*   **D: I pūtaketia e te paetata te kai me te inu (Food and drink sourced locally)** - This aligns with the discussion of regional delicacies and homemade food.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e kore e puritia ki Beijing i te tau 2022?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā takahanga rohe reti Taizicheng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko ngā huinga retireti kei te wāhi retireti Taizicheng ki Zhangjiakou, he āhua 220 km (140 mairo) mai i Beijing."" This directly translates to ""The snow sports competitions will be held at the Taizicheng ski resort in Zhangjiakou, about 220 km (140 miles) from Beijing.""

Therefore, the snow sports competitions (Ngā takahanga rohe reti Taizicheng) are *not* held in Beijing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Whakatuwhera ana i ngā hākari (Opening ceremonies)** - The passage says Beijing will host open, closed, and indoor events, which includes opening ceremonies.
*   **C: Kati ana i ngā hākari (Closing ceremonies)** - Similar to the opening ceremonies, Beijing will host these too.
*   **D: Ngā takahanga hukapapa rō whare (Indoor events)** - The passage specifically states Beijing will be the host for indoor events.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ka taurimatia e Beijing i te tau 2022?","The correct answer is **C: Te Omihana o te hōtoke** (The Winter Olympics).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ka noho te tāone nui o Beijing ki Haina hei tāone manaaki i **Ngā Taumāhekeheke Hōtoke** o te Ao hei te tau 2022"" which translates to ""The city of Beijing in China will host the **Winter Olympics** in 2022.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te Omihana raumati** (The Summer Olympics) - The passage specifically mentions this is the *first* time the Games will be held in summer *and* winter.
*   **B: Ko nga takahanga hukapapa e tū ana i rō whare** (Indoor ice sports competitions) - While indoor sports are mentioned, it's not the main event Beijing is hosting.
*   **D: Nga hākari kati** (Closed ceremonies) - The passage mentions both open and closed competitions, so it doesn't focus solely on closed ceremonies.



"
Ko wai te tino mate ka pa ki te rewharewha avian?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngā kaimahi Poultry** (Poultry workers).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Ko te nuinga kua pā ki ngā tāngata e mahi nei me ngā manu pāmu..."" which translates to ""Most of those affected are people working with poultry...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā kaitiaki manu** (Bird watchers) - While the text mentions bird watchers *could* be affected, it's stated as a possibility, not the primary group affected.
*   **B: Ngā tāngata e mahi ana me ngā whāngote** (People working with nests) - The text refers to working with *birds* (manu pāmu), not specifically nests.
*   **D: Ngā tāngata kua whakapokea i mua** (People who have been vaccinated before) - The text doesn't mention anything about prior vaccinations.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā tauākī e whai ake nei e whakamārama tika ana i te rewharewha manu?","The correct answer is **C: Kei te mōrearea te hunga mātakitaki manu kia mate.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...however it may also affect bird watchers."" ( ""...heoi tērā pea ka mōrearea hoki ki te hunga mātaki manu."") This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ko ngā kaimahi manu anake kua pāngia e te rewharewha:** The passage says most cases are in people working with poultry, *but* also that it *may* affect bird watchers.
* **B: He nui ake ngā take i pūrongotia i te tangata i te manu:** The passage doesn't compare the number of cases in humans vs. birds.
* **D: Ko ngā take katoa i pūrongotia i te tangata i mate:** The passage states *some* have died, not *all*.



"
He aha te mea e hono ana i te Moana Pākehā-Baltic Canal?,"The correct answer is **C: Moana o te Moana o Te Moana me te Moana Baltic**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ka hono te White Sea-Baltic Canal i te Arctic Ocean ki te Baltic Sea mā Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga me Saint Petersburg..."" 

Therefore, the White Sea-Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te momo waka ka kohia pea ngā uruwhenua kia kore ai e haukoti i te pāhihi?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā tereina moe pō** (Night trains).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""I ngā tereina-moe o ngā pō, ka kohia ngā uruwhenua e te kaitaki tereina kia kore ai koe e whakahōhātia nōu e moe ana.""  This translates to: ""On the night trains, the conductor collects tickets so you are not disturbed while sleeping.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā Mahere (Plans):**  This is unrelated to the passage.
* **C: Ngā Kaipuke (Ships):** The passage mentions ships as a mode of transport, but doesn't say tickets are collected on them to prevent disturbance while sleeping.
* **D: Ngā tereina taitapa-taitapa (Local trains):** The passage refers to long-distance trains (""tereina whakawhiti-rohe""), not local ones.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, āhea pea ka tirohia tō ID i ētahi tereina taitapa?","The correct answer is **B: I a koe e moe ana**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I ngā tereina-moe o ngā pō, ka kohia ngā uruwhenua e te kaitaki tereina kia kore ai koe e whakahōhātia nōu e moe ana.""  This translates to: ""On overnight trains, the conductor collects tickets so you aren't disturbed while sleeping.""  This implies your ID (or ticket, functioning as ID) would be checked *while you are sleeping* to avoid waking you.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I muri iho i te whakakotahitanga i te tereina:** The passage doesn't mention ID checks immediately after boarding.
*   **C: Kāore e tirohia:** The passage clearly states tickets are collected.
*   **D: I runga i te tereina oma:** The passage focuses on overnight/sleeper trains, not fast trains.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā take e whai ake nei ka tino puta ake i te wā e noho ana i te rohe teitei o Singapore?,"The correct answer is **C: E pāngia ana te rongoā wera** (You are affected by the heat).

Here's why:

* **P** directly states: ""...nā te noho ki ngā """"takiwa tino pārū"""" ētahi tīkiri noa ki te raki o te weheruatanga o te ao ka pāngia koe e te wera (i ngā wā katoa)...""  This translates to ""…living in the 'higher regions' a few degrees north of the equator, you will be affected by the heat (always)…""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kei te tore** (It is crowded) - The passage mentions convenience for shopping but doesn't talk about overcrowding.
* **B: Kāore he āheitanga ki ngā toa** (No access to shops) - The passage explicitly says you can buy most things after arriving.
* **D: Kua ngaro** (Lost) - The passage doesn't mention getting lost.



"
Ko wai e kore e pai ki te kai i ngā keke Tiamana?,"The correct answer is **A: Ko tētahi tangata whai nati tino nui** (Someone with a severe nut allergy).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kei ngā tini tunumanga parāoa Tiamani he aramona, he hānati, he nati rākau atu anō hoki."" (Many German baked goods contain almonds, hazelnuts, and nuts.) 

Therefore, someone with a severe nut allergy would *not* enjoy German cakes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ko tētahi tangata e hiahia ana ki ngā tohu taunaki ake** (Someone who wants more health-conscious options) - The passage doesn't discuss healthiness, just richness and variety.
* **C: Ko tētahi tangata e whakakino ana i te tiokorete** (Someone who hates chocolate) - While not *every* German cake has chocolate, it's a common ingredient and doesn't make someone unable to enjoy them all.
* **D: Ko tētahi tangata e hiahia ana ki ngā kaihoko reka i runga i nga kaihoko rei** (Someone who wants sweet pastries on budget pastries) - This is a confusing option and not related to anything mentioned in the text.



"
Ko tehea te kai e kiia ana he huānga o te wā o ngā keke Tiamana?,"The correct answer is **C: Paramu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ka kitea ngā tiere, ngā **paramu** i te wā o te raumati."" (…you can find plums, **peaches** in the summer.) This directly links peaches (paramu) to being seen during the time of German cakes/pastries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Āporoiti (Apples):** While apples are mentioned (""ka tunua ngā āporo""), they are described as being baked into pies *throughout the year*, not specifically linked to the time of cakes.
*   **B: Hazelnuts:** Hazelnuts are mentioned as an ingredient (""he hānati, he nati rākau""), but not as a defining feature of the time of German cakes.
*   **D: Aramona (Aromas):** Aromas are a sensory experience, not a food item.



"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, ko tēhea o ēnei ehara i te aki tūtohu mo te haere i runga i te tahua?","The correct answer is **C: Tono tāngata mō te moni (Beg people for money)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states ""Ko te whakapae kē, kāore te tangata karore e whānako, e aurara noa, e mahi kino, e pīnono haere, e takahi rānei i te manaakitanga a tētahi atu."" This translates to ""The assumption is, a person without money does not steal, wander aimlessly, do evil, beg, or violate the hospitality of others.""  Therefore, *begging* is presented as something someone on a budget *shouldn't* do.

Let's look at why the other options are good advice based on the text:

*   **A: Kimihia ngā mahi rerekē hei mahi i roto i ō haerenga (Find different jobs to do during your travels):**  The text mentions ""Ka mahi i a koe e hāereere ana"" (work while you travel) as a way to offset costs.
*   **B: Kia ngāwari ki tō taumata whakamarie (Be flexible with your comfort level):** The text speaks to adjusting to different situations and being willing to compromise on comfort to travel cheaply.
*   **D: Whakaitihia nga whakapaunga penei i te kai me te noho (Reduce expenses like food and accommodation):** The text directly mentions finding ways to lower costs, including accommodation and food.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, tērā pea he uaua te haere i runga i te tahua iti rawa?","The correct answer is **C: E hiahia ana tētahi ki te mahi mamao i a ia e haere ana**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ka mahi i a koe e hāereere ana, tērā rānei me whakawhāiti koe i ō utu.""  This translates to ""Either work while you travel, or reduce your expenses."" This directly implies a willingness to work remotely *while* traveling to offset costs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ko tētahi tangata e pōhiri ana i tētahi uaua:** (Someone welcoming a difficulty) - The passage discusses *how to deal with* budget travel, not welcoming difficulty.
* **B: Tētahi tangata kāore he herenga wā pākaha:** (Someone with no fixed schedule) - While flexibility is helpful for budget travel, the passage doesn't focus on *having* no schedule, but rather *making* choices about how to fund your travels.
* **D: Ko tētahi tangata e hiahia ana ki te whai i tētahi iti:** (Someone wanting to pursue a little) -  This is too vague and doesn’t connect to the core idea of working while traveling to reduce costs.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e kore e tino whakaahua i te waka i waenganui i Point Marion me Fairmont?,"The correct answer is **D: Ko te tikanga kia kaua te ratonga waea pūkoro e take**.

Here's why:

The passage *specifically states* that cell service is *better* in this section compared to other parts of the route (like the Pennsylvania Wilds). Option D claims the opposite – that cell service will be a problem.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate based on the passage:

*   **A: He roa nga whārōrō o te huarahi whenua mamao** - The passage describes driving through ""lands wao mohoao"" (remote, forested land), implying long stretches of rural roads.
*   **B: He kikī nga Lanes** - The passage mentions ""nui ngā paripari, ngā huarahi whāiti"" (many curves, narrow lanes), indicating winding roads.
*   **C: Āhua kore nei e piri ana ngā tepe tere ki** - The passage says speed limits are lower and should be followed closely (""he iti iho ngā here tere e tohua ana,"" ""he mea hira rawa te tino whai i ēnei"").



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei he tino māharahara mo nga atekōkiri e haere ana i runga i te huarahi Buffalo-Pittsburg?","The correct answer is **C: Kia tere rawa te huri koi**. 

Here's why:

The passage specifically warns drivers to be careful of ""numerous curves, winding roads, and steep drop-offs"" in the section between Point Marion and Fairmont. This means drivers need to be prepared to turn quickly and navigate challenging road conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E mau ana i roto i nga waka taumaha** - The passage doesn't mention heavy traffic.
*   **B: Kāore i te tika te ratonga pūkoro** - The passage states cell service is *better* in this section compared to others.
*   **D: E pā ana ki ngā mahi huarahi auau** - While road work is always a possibility, the passage doesn't specifically mention frequent road work as a primary hazard.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e kore e hiahiatia hei tīmata i te hīkoi?,"The correct answer is **D: He iti te whakangungu (Little training)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states that while canyoneering doesn't *require* the extensive training of things like rock climbing, it *does* require some training. It contrasts canyoneering with activities that *do* need extensive training. Therefore, having *little* training would be a disadvantage and something you would *not* have if you were starting canyoneering.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te kaha ki te kauhoe (The ability to swim)** - The passage mentions potentially descending *into water*, making swimming ability important.
*   **B: Te āhua ōkiko o Peak (Physical fitness)** -  Canyoneering involves hiking, scrambling, and potentially climbing, meaning good physical fitness is needed.
*   **C: Āheinga Peke (Abseiling ability)** - The passage states canyoneering involves descending (peke), which often uses abseiling techniques.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e hiahiatia ana hei haerenga pai ki te awaawa?,"The correct answer is **A: Āheinga athletic arā atu anō (Good physical fitness and more)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ko te Canyon e whakakotahi ana i ngā āhuatanga o te kaukau, o te piki me te peke...ēngari ehara i te mea me pakari rawa me nui tonu hoki ngā whakangungu"" (Canyoneering combines elements of hiking, climbing and rappelling...but doesn't require extensive training). This implies a good level of fitness is *necessary* to handle those elements.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: I mua i te wheako me te ruku scuba (Previous experience and scuba diving):** Scuba diving is not mentioned in the description of canyoneering and isn't a required skill.
    * **C: He tiwhikete i roto i te tangata e whai ana (A certificate in following people):** While guiding experience might be useful, it's not a requirement for *participating* in canyoneering.
    * **D: Kei te kaha te tiki (Strong pulling strength):** While rappelling is involved (which uses pulling strength), the passage doesn't say this is the *only* or most important requirement.  Overall fitness encompasses strength.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te āwhina ki tētahi tangata e whakaaro ana ki te hopuni i roto i to rātau motokā?","The correct answer is **B: He waka e āhei ai nga tūru ki te whakatakoto** (A vehicle that allows luggage to be laid down).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka taea te hopuni ā-waka mehemea he wākena rahi, he SUV, he Sedan, he Station Wagon rānei tāu me ngā tūru ka taea te whakatakoto.""  This directly translates to ""Vehicle touring is possible if you have a large van, SUV, Sedan, or Station Wagon *with space to lay down luggage*.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He mōhiotanga kaha ki nga tepenga o to waka** (Strong knowledge of the mechanics of your vehicle) - While knowing your car is good, the passage focuses on *space* for belongings, not mechanical knowledge.
*   **C: He tēneti** (A tent) - The passage mentions setting up a tent in a remote place or town, but doesn't suggest a tent *helps* with touring *in* your car.
*   **D: He āhuatanga tūmataiti ki te hopuni i runga i te** (A small feature to tour on) - This is vague and not supported by the text.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha pea e hiahia ana ngā puni motokā ki te karo mehemea kei te kimi rātau ki te noho i raro i te hihiani?","The correct answer is **C: Te whakatū teneti i te tāone, i te whenua tūmataiti rānei** (Parking in a city, or a small rural area).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mā te whakarite teneti ki runga i tētahi wāhi tūmatawhāiti, ki runga rānei i tētahi tāone ahakoa te nui, kāore e kore ka tae mai ngā titiro kikino.""  This translates to: ""By parking in a small rural area, or in a town no matter the size, unwanted looks are bound to come.""

The passage implies that parking in these locations will draw attention (negative attention - ""titiro kikino"") and thus make it harder to remain unnoticed (""noho i raro i te hihiani"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage suggests smaller vehicles are *better* for remaining inconspicuous, not avoiding larger ones.
* **B:** The passage doesn’t mention trailer length.
* **D:** Knowing your vehicle is stated as important (""me te mōhio hoki ki ana here"") – not a way to avoid attention.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nāna i hanga anō a Casablanca i te tuarua o nga wā?","The correct answer is **D: Te sultan o Morocco**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""I hangaia anō e te sultan o Marako te tāone nui hei Daru I-Badya, ā, i tapaina ki te ingoa o Casablanca e ngā kaihokohoko Pāniora nā rātou he wāhi hokohoko i whakatū ki reira."" 

This translates to: ""The city was rebuilt by the sultan of Morocco as Daru I-Badya, and named Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established a trading post there.""

While the Spanish *named* it Casablanca, the sultan of Morocco is the one who *rebuilt* the city.



"
Ko wai i whakarere i te taone hou o Casablanca i muri i tētahi aitua māori?,"The correct answer is **B: Te Potukara (The Portuguese)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nā te iwi Potugese i turaki, ka hanga mai anō me te ingoa o Casa Branca, ka whakarerea hoki whai muri mai i te rū whenua i te tau 1755.""  This translates to: ""The Portuguese invaded, rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca, and abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā Roman (The Romans):** The text mentions Romans *using* Anfa, but not abandoning it.
*   **C: Te Spanish (The Spanish):** The Spanish *renamed* it Casablanca after establishing a trading post, they didn’t abandon it originally.
*   **D: Nga Phoenician (The Phoenicians):** Like the Romans, the Phoenicians used Anfa, but didn’t abandon it.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i pēhea te whiwhi āhukahuka a Sintra i waenganui i nga manene?","The correct answer is **C: Ngā arotakenga tōrunga a Te Ariki Byron**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...i rongonui ai ki te hunga rāwaho i muri i te kōrero kauanuanu mō āna ātanga nā Lord Byron i tuhi.""  This translates to ""...became famous among foreigners after the romantic tales about its landscapes written by Lord Byron."" 

Therefore, Sintra gained popularity with foreigners *because* of Lord Byron's glowing descriptions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cabo da Roca** - Cabo da Roca is a place you can *visit* near Sintra, but doesn't explain *why* Sintra became famous.
*   **B: Ngā taupānga Marian** - Marian apparitions are mentioned in relation to Fatima, not Sintra.
*   **D: He hītori mātao tēnei** - The text doesn't suggest the information is inaccurate.



"
He aha te mea kāore i te mōhiotia e Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: Te whenua hou**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a new state was created with Armenian support, *but* no country – including Armenia – officially recognized it. This means Armenia knew *about* the new state, but didn't acknowledge its legitimacy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te rohe Nagorno-Karabakh:** Armenia was actively involved in the conflict *over* Nagorno-Karabakh, so they certainly knew about the region.
*   **B: Te whawhai ki nga Azeris:** The passage directly states the conflict was *between* Armenians and Azerbaijanis.
*   **C: Ngā tohenga whakawhanaunga a Azerbaijan:** The passage highlights the ongoing tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan, implying Armenia was well aware of Azerbaijan's claims.



"
He aha te mea e pā tonu ana ki ngā whanaungatanga i waenganui i Azerbaijan me Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: Rohe Nagorno-Karabakh**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""ngā amuamu ā-takawaenga mō te rohe e haere tonu ana ngā hononga i waenganui i a Armenia me Azerbaijan"" – disputes *over the region* continue to affect relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.  That region is Nagorno-Karabakh.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aramenia e noho ana i Azerbaijan** (Armenia lives in Azerbaijan) - While there's a history of Armenian population in the region, the passage doesn't say Armenia *lives* in Azerbaijan, but rather that the conflict centers around a region with Armenian and Azeri populations.
* **B: Te pakanga o te tau 1994** (The war of 1994) - The war *caused* the current issues, but isn't what *continues* to affect the relationship now - the unresolved status of the region is.
* **C: Ngā tohenga ā-ture** (Legal disputes) - While there are likely legal aspects to the dispute, the passage focuses on the territorial issue and the lack of international recognition, not specifically legal arguments.



"
"I a ia e mau ana i tētahi teka i Charlotte, he aha pea ka āhei ki tētahi utu tāpiri?","The correct answer is **B: Tokotoru nga pāhihi (Three bedrooms)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He utu āpiti mō te whai i te nui ake i te 2 pāhihi, nō reira ka nui pea te utu mō tēnei kōwhiringa i te mea waiwai.""  This translates to ""There is an extra cost for having more than 2 bedrooms, so this option could be more expensive for what it's worth.""

Therefore, if someone is willing to pay an additional cost while renting in Charlotte, it's likely for a larger property – specifically, one with three bedrooms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kei te noho anō ki tētahi atu rohe (Living in another region):** The passage discusses costs *within* Charlotte, not moving elsewhere.
*   **C: Haere ana ki Uptown (Going to Uptown):** While Uptown has growing family options, the passage doesn't suggest an extra cost for *visiting* or being in Uptown.
*   **D: He rata ki te whānau (Family-friendly):** Charlotte is already described as family-friendly, and there's no mention of an extra cost to make a place more family-friendly.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea e whakaarotia ana he kōaro ki te noho i Charlotte me nga tamariki?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā utu whare (Housing costs)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He utu āpiti mō te whai i te nui ake i te 2 pāhihi, nō reira ka nui pea te utu mō tēnei kōwhiringa i te mea waiwai."" This translates to ""There is a cost to having more than 2 bedrooms, so this option can be expensive given its value.""  This directly points to housing costs (specifically, the cost of larger homes) being a consideration when living in Charlotte with children.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: E mau ana i tētahi teka (Getting stuck in traffic):** While the passage mentions families *sometimes* needing to drive, it doesn't present traffic as a major drawback.
*   **C: Ngā tangata whenua o ētahi atu wāhi (People from other places):** The passage states people *move to* Charlotte from other places, it doesn't frame this as a negative.
*   **D: E ngana ana ki te hākinakina i te taone (Trying to play sports in the city):** The passage doesn't discuss sports or difficulty playing them.



"
"I mua i te taenga mai o nga Paniora, ko wai i whakahaere i te taha raki o Chile?","The correct answer is **A: Mapuche**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...i raro a Chile ki te raki i te mana o Inca, ā, ko ngā māori o Araucanian (Mapuche) i noho atu ki te pokapū me te tonga o Chile.""  This translates to: ""...northern Chile was under Inca rule, and the native Araucanians (Mapuche) lived in central and southern Chile.""

While ""Araucanians"" (C) is also mentioned, the text clarifies that ""Mapuche"" is the name for that group.  The Inca ruled the *north*, and the Mapuche lived in the *center and south*. The question specifically asks about the *north*.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i puta i te tau kotahi mano 1810?","The correct answer is **B: I tutuki i a Chile te wikitōria i runga i te Pāniora**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He ahakoa i tū motuhake a Chile i te tau 1810... kāore tonu i whakatutuki te tino wikitoria ki ngā Pāniora tae rawa ki te tau 1818."" (Although Chile declared independence in 1810... it did not achieve complete victory over the Spanish until 1818).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tērā te korenga o te kāwanatanga matua** - The passage mentions the Napoleonic Wars led to a lack of strong Spanish governance *during* 1810.
*   **C: E whawhaitia ana nga pakanga Napoleonic** - The passage explicitly states the Napoleonic Wars were happening *during* 1810.
*   **D: I whakapuakina e Chile te rangatiratanga** - The passage states Chile declared independence *in* 1810.



"
Me pēhea e tae ai te tangata ki nga kāinga mamao i te rohe o Liguria?,"The correct answer is **C: Mā te tereina, poti rānei** (By train or boat).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kei te honohono ngā ara, ngā tereina, ngā pōti hoki i ngā kāinga, ā, e kore e taea e ngā waka te tae atu ki reira mai i waho."" (The paths, trains, and boats connect the villages, and boats cannot reach them from outside.)
* This clearly indicates that trains and boats are the methods of transport *to* the villages.
* Cars cannot directly access the villages.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mā te motokā, poti rānei** - Cars are explicitly stated as *not* being able to reach the villages from outside.
* **B: Mā te motokā, te tereina rānei** -  Again, cars are not an option.
* **D: Mā te waka rererangi, te tereina rānei** - Airplanes are not mentioned and not a practical way to reach these coastal villages."
He aha te kōrero a te kupu Itari 'Cinque Terre'?,"The correct answer is **A: E rima nga kāinga** (Five homes/villages).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko Cinque Terre, ko te tikanga ko Ngā Whenua e Rima..."" which directly translates to ""Cinque Terre, meaning The Five Lands..."" and then lists the five villages.  ""Terre"" in Italian means ""lands"" and in this context refers to the villages/homes.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea momo whakaara e tika ana mō ngā āhuatanga o te hōtoke māniania?","The correct answer is **C: Whakaara me ngā rekereke tiketike** (Fasteners with wide flanged washers).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Me pāpaku, me whānui ngā rekereke."" (The flanges should be shallow and wide). This directly translates to needing wide flanged washers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Whakaara me ngā rekereke whāiti** (Fasteners with small flanges) - The passage explicitly says *wide* flanges, not small.
* **B: Whakaara me ngā taputapu tāpae** (Fasteners with spring devices) - The passage doesn't mention spring devices.
* **D: Ngā whakaara me te kore tauira hōhonu 1/5 inihi** (Fasteners without a 1/5 inch deep pattern) - The passage *requires* a pattern at least 5mm (1/5 inch) deep, it doesn't say to avoid it.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e kore e āwhina ki te whakapai ake i te pūngao i runga i ngā huarahi hukarere i te wā o te hotoke?,"The correct answer is **D: Wai**.

Here's why:

The passage states that materials like sand (oneone), gravel (matakirikiri), and pumice (konopūmā pūhaumāota - translated as tote in the options) are used to *improve grip* on icy paths.  However, water (wai) would actually *reduce* grip and make icy surfaces *more* slippery. 

Let's break down why the other options are correct:

*   **A: Tote (Pumice)** - The passage specifically mentions pumice as a good material to improve grip.
*   **B: Kirikiri (Gravel)** - The passage lists gravel as a material to improve grip.
*   **C: Onepū (Sand)** - The passage lists sand as a material to improve grip.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kōrero e ōrite ana ki a Hawaii me ngā Moutere o Cook?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka tiria e rātou te rohe wā ōrite** (They share the same time zone).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""E ōrite ana te wāhi wā ki tā hawaii..."" which directly translates to ""It has the same time zone as Hawaii...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He maha nga hōtēra nunui o rāua tahi** (They both have many large hotels) - The passage specifically states the Cook Islands *don't* have large tourist hotels like Hawaii did before settlement.
*   **B: Kāore i a rāua tahi te tūnga** (They don't have the same standing) - This is too vague and not directly addressed in the text.
*   **D: Kāore ō rāua tahi i te whai pa** (They don't both have coastlines) - Both Hawaii and the Cook Islands are island nations and therefore *do* have coastlines.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kōrero e kore e tika te whakaahua i ngā Moutere o Cook?,"The correct answer is **B: He pūranga tēnei**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""He motumotu e 15 ngā motu e horapa ana i te 2.2 miriona km2 o te moana."" (It is an archipelago of 15 islands spread over 2.2 million km2 of ocean.)

* **""He pūranga tēnei"" translates to ""This is a peninsula"".**  A peninsula is a piece of land almost surrounded by water, but connected to the mainland. The Cook Islands are *not* a peninsula; they are a scattered group of islands (an archipelago).

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct based on the text:

* **A: He iti iho i Hawaii (It is smaller than Hawaii):** The text says, ""Ahakoa he iti iho..."" (Although it is smaller...)
* **C: Ko nga tāone matua ko Rarotonga me Aitutaki (The main islands are Rarotonga and Aitutaki):**  The text directly states, ""Ko ngā motu matua ko Rarotonga me Aitutaki.""
* **D: Kei te tiri te whenua motu i te rohe wā ōrite ki Hawaii (The archipelago spreads over a similar time zone to Hawaii):** The text states, ""E ōrite ana te wāhi wā ki tā hawaii..."" (It has a similar time zone to Hawaii...)



"
Ko tēhea o ngā teihana ranger e whai ake nei e tuku ana i ngā momo noho e rua?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ko Sirena anake te teihana whare kaitiaki e tuku ana i te wharenoho rūma moe, te noho me ngā kai wera hei tāpiritanga ki te pūpahi."" 

This translates to: ""Only Sirena ranger station offers lodging rooms, accommodation and hot meals in addition to the bunkhouse.""

Therefore, Sirena is the only station offering both types of accommodation (rooms *and* bunkhouse/accommodation). The other stations only offer the bunkhouse (pūpahi).



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ka taea e koe te rāhui i tētahi haerengapāka mēnā e hiahia ana koe ki te whakamahi moni, kaua ko te hua?","The correct answer is **C: CafeNet El Sol**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kei te tuku a CafeNet El Sol i tētahi ratonga whakarite mō te utu o te $US30, te $10 rānei mō ngā tīkiti kotahi-rangi; kei tā rātou whārangi Corcovado ngā taipitopito."" 

This translates to: ""CafeNet El Sol offers a booking service for a fee of $US30, or $10 for single-night tickets; their Corcovado page has the details.""

The question asks where you can *pay money* to arrange a permit. CafeNet El Sol is the only option that explicitly offers a service for a fee (money) to help with permits.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te momo reti e mahia ana i te whenua poupou ake?","The correct answer is **C: Kāhua Alpine**.

Here's why:

The passage describes ""reti"" (skiing) that is done on gentler slopes around the edges, requiring wider skis and more careful planning. It compares this type of skiing to hiking and mentions longer distances are possible than with typical skiing *unless* you reach the edge of ""reti hīkoi hukapapa"" (backcountry ski hiking).  This directly relates to **Alpine skiing** - skiing that happens *outside* of groomed runs, often requiring more skill and planning, and can involve hiking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ski hiki:** While ""hiki"" means to climb, the passage doesn't focus on *climbing* with skis, but rather skiing on different terrains.
*   **B: E rere ana te whenua o muri:** This translates to ""the backcountry is running"" and doesn't represent a type of skiing.
*   **D: Kei te pōkai anō mā te reti:** This means ""still going back to skiing"" and is not a type of skiing itself.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha pea ka āwhina ki te whakahoki i ngā reti whenua e hiahia ana ki te tae ki ngā tere teitei ake?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā pūtu Stiffer** (Stiffer poles).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ka hiahiatia ngā reti me ngā **pūtu māro ake**."" ( ""...more rigid poles will be needed."")  This directly translates to needing stiffer poles to handle the demands of more challenging terrain and potentially steeper inclines associated with more advanced backcountry skiing/snowshoeing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He pōkai tuarā taumaha** (A heavy backpack): While a heavy pack *could* be relevant to backcountry travel, the passage doesn't suggest it helps with reaching higher speeds or tackling terrain. It actually mentions avoiding a heavy pack if a designated trail isn't available.
* **C: Ngā here pai** (Good bindings): Bindings are important, but the passage doesn't link them to achieving higher speeds or tackling steeper terrain.
* **D: Ngā riu kua purua** (Broken skis): Broken skis would obviously hinder progress, not help!



"
He uaua ki te mahi i te aha te hunga e haere ana e pā ana ki te whakaoho i te hokinga mai?,"The correct answer is **A: E urutau ana ki te ahurea o tētahi wāhi hōu** (Adapting to a new culture).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that travelers easily adapt to the new culture (""he māmā te urutau ki te ahurea hou"") but can find it difficult to readjust to their original culture (""he uaua tā rātou urutau anō ki tō rātou ahurea taketake""). This adaptation *is* the difficulty regarding re-entry.  The passage highlights that gaining a new culture often means losing connection with your home culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He manawanui, he mātauranga hoki** (Patience and understanding) - While helpful, the passage implies the *problem* isn't a lack of patience or understanding *while traveling*, but the *result* of adapting to a new culture.
* **C: Haere ana ki rāwāhi** (Traveling abroad) - This is the *cause* of the issue, not the difficulty itself.
* **D: Pānui ana ki tō rātou ahurea kāinga** (Reading about their home culture) - This might *help* with re-entry, but the passage describes the difficulty as stemming from *having lived* in another culture, not a lack of knowledge about your own.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, He uaua rawa pea te pāwera o te hokinga mai anō mō te momo tangata haere?","The correct answer is **A: Ko ngā manuhiri i pā ki te tino kino o te ahurea**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ka kino ake hoki pea [the impact of returning]. "" (it could get worse). This refers to the negative impact of cultural readjustment.
* **The passage also states:** ""... kua ngaro i a koe ētahi o ngā tikanga o te kāinga."" (you may have lost some of the customs of home). This highlights the difficulty of reintegration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngā haere i tere te whakatika i a rātau e noho ana ki rāwāhi:** The passage actually suggests it's *easier* for travelers to adapt to a new culture, not that those who adapt quickly have a harder time returning.
* **C: Ngā haere e noho tonu ana i te wāhanga mārō:**  ""Wāhanga mārō"" (rigid phase) isn't a concept discussed in the passage in relation to the difficulty of returning.
* **D: Ngā haere me te iti iho te manawanui:** While the passage mentions empathy being important for *adjusting* to a new culture, it doesn't link a lack of patience to the *difficulty of returning* home.



Therefore, option A best reflects the passage's statement about the potential for a negative and difficult experience when returning from travel."
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei me karo te tangata i te mahi i te moose?,"The correct answer is **D: E mātaki ana i a rātou i tētahi tawhiti** (Watching them from a distance).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ki te kore te tangata e kite i te mōrearea pea o te muhi, ka whakatata rawa pea rātou, ka mōrearea."" (If a person doesn't see the danger of the moose, they might get too close and be endangered).  This directly implies avoiding getting close is key.
* **""E mātaki ana i a rātou i tētahi tawhiti""** (Watching them from a distance) is the safest way to avoid getting too close and encountering danger.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E mōhio ana ki to rātau aroaro** (Knowing their appearance) - Knowing what they *look* like doesn't prevent you from getting too close.
* **B: He pōturi rawa te haere** (Walking very quietly) -  Quietly walking might not alert them, but it doesn't *prevent* danger if they are already close.
* **C: Whakamōkito ana i tō rātou taumata tuma tūpono** (Mimicking their level of aggression) - This is a very bad idea!  Trying to match a potentially dangerous animal's aggression is likely to escalate the situation.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki te moose ehara i te tika?","The correct answer is **A: He kararehe whakatuki noa rātau (They are simply timid animals)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the moose (Pihiringa/Eoka) *will* fight if provoked.** This directly contradicts the idea that they are simply timid. The passage describes them as not *actively* aggressive, but not fearful either - they defend themselves when necessary.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

* **B: I ētahi wā kāore rātau i te mōhiotia he tuma tūpono (Sometimes they don't realize a danger).** The passage says ""Ki te kore te tangata e kite i te mōrearea pea o te muhi"" -  meaning people might not see the danger the moose poses, implying the moose itself might not always perceive the threat.
* **C: Ka taea e rātau te whakaohotia e ngā tāngata e tata ana ki a rātau (They can be overtaken by people who get too close).** The passage warns that people who get too close ""ka mōrearea"" (will be endangered), suggesting a potential for harm if they encroach.
* **D: Ka tiaki rātau i a rātau anō mehemea e hiahiatia ana (They will defend themselves if necessary).** This is directly stated: ""ka whawhai tonu mēnā ka taka ki te raru"" (will fight if they get into trouble).



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei te iti rawa o te mōrearea mo te haere koraha?","The correct answer is **B: Te kite i te mirage e tuku ana i te whakaaro o te wai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states mirages are ""mōrearea pea"" (perhaps illusions/deceptive).** It acknowledges they *can* lead you astray, but doesn't present them as a significant danger in themselves. They are a visual trick.

Let's look at why the other options are more dangerous:

* **A: Te kore kakahu mahana i te pō makariri (Not having warm clothes at night in the cold):** The passage explicitly says this is a ""tūturu te mōrearea"" (real danger) and can lead to serious consequences due to the extreme cold.
* **C: E whai ana i te pūngao i a ia e whai ana i te mirage (Following a mirage as it is pursued):**  This is *because* of the mirage, and is dangerous - chasing an illusion leads to wasted energy and potential dehydration.
* **D: E horoi ana i te wai i a ia e whai ana i te mirage (Drinking water while pursuing a mirage):** The passage implies the mirage *looks* like water, but it's not actual water. Drinking from potentially unreliable sources (or nothing at all after chasing a mirage) is dangerous.



Therefore, simply *seeing* the mirage is the least dangerous of the options presented. It’s the *actions taken because of* the mirage that pose the real risks."
Ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i kōrerotia hei tuma tūpono mō ngā haere koraha?,"The correct answer is **D: Tātahu**.

Here's why:

* **Pōhewatanga/Mirages:** The passage specifically mentions mirages (""pōhewatanga e whakaatu ana i te mātātuhi mariko o te wai"") as something travelers might see.
* **Iti wai/Dehydration:** The passage mentions the risk of being parched and seeking out remaining water (""mā korā e moumou te ngoi tongarewa me te wai e toe ana""), implying dehydration is a danger.
* **Hauhauaitu/Hypothermia:** The passage directly states the desert gets very cold at night (""Ka tino makariri te koraha wera rawa o ngā koraha i te pō."") and shivering without warm clothes is a real risk (""He mōrearea tūturu te hauhauaitu i te korenga o ngā kākahu mahana"").
* **Tātahu/Burns:** While the desert is hot (""te wera o te rā"", ""koraha wera rawa""), the passage doesn't explicitly mention the risk of sunburns (tātahu). It focuses on heat *generally* and the dangers related to water and temperature extremes.

Therefore, **tātahu** is the hazard *not* mentioned in the text.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea te iwi whānui o te rōpū i tino pāngia i muri i te taenga mai o nga kaitoro?","The correct answer is **C: Te Taínos**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""i kitea te tāmatenga o te iwi Tainos i ngā mahi raupati a te iwi Pāniora."" (the decline of the Taino people due to the exploitation by the Spanish people).  It further details the high number of Tainos killed by the Spanish according to Fray Bartolome de las Casas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nga Haiti:** While Haiti shares the island, the passage focuses on the impact to the Tainos.
*   **B: Nga Kāpi:** The Caribes were mentioned as early inhabitants, but the passage doesn't highlight them as being specifically impacted *after* the arrival of Europeans.
*   **D: Te Spanish:** The Spanish were the *cause* of the impact, not the group *affected* by it.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea te reo i kōrerotia e nga Caribes?","The correct answer is **D: Arawakan**.

The text states: ""He hunga kōrero-Arawakan ngā Caribes..."" which translates to ""The Caribs were Arawakan speakers..."". 

Therefore, the passage directly states that the Caribes spoke Arawakan.



"
Ko wai e taea te tāwere ki te hīrere e paingia ana hei mahi whakangahau?,"The correct answer is **B: Nga Nōwei** (The Norwegians).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...i te tau 1861 i whakatuwheratia te karapu retireti tuatahi e ētahi tāngata nō Nōwei ki Ahitereiria."" ( ""...in 1861 the first ski club was opened by some people from Norway to Australia."")

This directly identifies Norwegians as being the ones who initiated the sport and opened the first club.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ski bums:**  While ""ski bums"" enjoy skiing, the passage doesn't mention them as *initiators* of the sport.
*   **C: Ngā kainoho Ana (Ana residents):** The passage doesn't mention residents of Ana.
*   **D: Nga Ahitereiria (The Australians):** Australians *hosted* the first club, but Norwegians *founded* it.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te wā i mōhiotia tuatahitia ai he tākaro?","The correct answer is **B: 5000 BC**.

The passage states: ""He tawhito rawa te ariā o te eke rēti - kei te kitea he toi ana e whakaatu ana i ngā kaieke rēti mai rā anō i te 5000 BC!"" which translates to: ""The history of skiing is very old - rock carvings have been found showing skiers dating back to 5000 BC!""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te rau tau 18 (The 1800s)** - While skiing as a *sport* developed around this time, the passage states people were skiing much earlier.
*   **C: 1861** - This is the year the first ski club was founded, not when skiing was first practiced.
*   **D: Te rau tau 17 (The 1700s)** - The passage mentions skiing as a sport developed *from* the 17th century onwards, but not as its origin.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e pā ana ki te motu nui rawa atu i te takutai o Awherika ki te rawhiti?,"The correct answer is **D: tauranga whai rawa (harbour/port)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ko Marakāhia te mea nui rawa, ā, he paparahi ki tōna kotahi e hāngai ana ki ngā kararehe mohoao."" This translates to ""Madagascar is the largest, and has a large area with unique wildlife.""  The passage then implies its importance as a point of call due to its location and mentions early Arab and later European influence linked to trade routes.
* **Tauranga whai rawa (harbour/port)** best reflects the function and importance of a large island like Madagascar in relation to trade routes along the East African coast.  It would have served as a key stop for ships.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Awenga Ūropi (European influence):** While the passage *mentions* European influence, it doesn't define the island itself.
* **B: hāhi ā-Rangi (religion/church):**  The passage doesn't focus on religious aspects of the island.
* **C: Waiora (health/life):** While Madagascar has unique wildlife (life), the passage doesn't center around health or life specifically.



"
He aha te mea ehara i te āhuatanga o ngā motu iti o Awherika ki te Rāwhiti? ,"The correct answer is **B: He maha nga tauranga whai hua** (They have many profitable harbors).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""he hononga ki Wīwī rānei"" (a connection to France or...) and ""he wāhi whakatā taha moana hāneanea rawa"" (a very popular seaside resort). This supports options A and C.
* **The passage also states:** ""He whenua motuhake te nuinga o ngā motu iti iho..."" (Most of the smaller islands are independent territories). This supports option D - independent/sovereignty.
* **The passage *does not* mention profitable harbors.** It focuses on resorts and political connections.

Therefore, having many profitable harbors is the one thing *not* described as a characteristic of the smaller islands of East Africa.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he pēhea te hākari a te Aranga e ētahi hāhi tūturu?","The correct answer is **C: Te whakahaere i tētahi pō hararei mō te whakaminenga**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ko ngā whare karakia tūturu ake o mua ka mau tonu ki te Easter Vigil i te pō o te Hatarei i te wā o te mutunga wiki Aranga, ā, ko ngā minenga ka puta ki te whakanuitanga i te wā pū tonu o te tūruawēpō kia whakanui i te aranga mai o Ihu.""

This translates to ""...older traditional churches still hold the Easter Vigil on the night of Holy Saturday during Easter week, and congregations gather to celebrate at the precise moment of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus."" 

This describes a special night of celebration and gathering – a holiday for the congregation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te pupuri i tētahi tikanga kōkā:** While the passage mentions traditions, it doesn't specifically state it's a *funeral* tradition.
*   **B: E taurima ana i tētahi whakatūpato pō Hātarei:** The passage doesn’t mention a warning or caution for Holy Saturday.
*   **D: E mātakitaki ana i te whitinga:** While watching the sunrise is *part* of the tradition mentioned in the first sentence, the passage focuses on the church's practice of a night-time vigil and celebration.

"Hei karo i ētahi whakaritenga ina tomo ki Ecuador, me whai aha tētahi tangata whenua Cuban i te tuatahi?","The correct answer is **B: He reta tono ā-ture** (A letter of intent).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kei te here a Ekuatoa i ngā kainoho nō Kiupa kia riro i a rātou tētahi reta tono i mua i te uru atu ki Ekuatoa..."" (Ecuador requires Cuban residents to obtain a letter of intent before entering Ecuador...). This is the *first* thing they need to do.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He uruwhenua e tika ana mō te ono marama i tua atu i ngā rā haerenga** (A visa valid for six months beyond the travel dates) - While a valid visa *is* required, the passage says they need the letter of intent *before* even applying for the visa.
*   **C: He tiikiti haere whakamuri hei whakaatu i te roa o te noho** (A return ticket to show the length of stay) - This is a requirement *in addition* to the letter and visa, not the first step.
*   **D: He kāri kākāriki US** (A US green card) - The passage states Cubans with US green cards still need to go to an Ecuatorian Consulate to be validated under this policy. It’s not a substitute for the required letter.



"
He aha ngā whakaritenga haere a Ecuador kāore i hoahoatia?,"The correct answer is **A: Kei te pupuri i te maha o ngā haere ki te mōkito (Controlling the number of trips to the border)**.

Here's why:

The passage details specific requirements for Cubans traveling to Ecuador:

*   **Letter of Invitation:** Required from someone in Ecuador.
*   **Consular Approval:** Cubans with US Green Cards need approval from an Ecuadorian Consulate.
*   **Passport Validity:** Must be valid for 6 months beyond the travel dates.
*   **Confirmed Tickets:** Proof of onward and return travel is needed.

The passage *doesn't* mention any limitations on the *number* of trips to the border. Options B, C, and D are all directly addressed in the text. Therefore, controlling the number of trips is not a requirement outlined in the provided text.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ka nui ake te utu i te whenua ke i te kāinga?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngā tāpare mutunga-teitei (High-end fittings)**.

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

The passage states: ""...ko ngā mea tūturu kua kawea mai ka nui ake pea te utu i te utu ki te kāinga.""  This translates to ""...genuine items brought in may cost more than the cost at home.""

The passage specifically mentions that *genuine* imported items (like high-end fittings - ""tāpare mutunga-teitei"") are likely to be more expensive than buying them domestically.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā whakamātautau whatu (Eye tests):** The passage discusses materials and labor, not healthcare services.
*   **C: inihua kitenga (Sight insurance):** This is also related to healthcare and not the cost of goods.
*   **D: Ngā tāpare ingoa-kore (Generic fittings):** The passage specifically states that *counterfeits* (""tāruatanga noa iho"") are cheap, and *genuine* items are expensive.



"
He aha ngā mōrearea ka taea e te hoko i ngā anga teitei i tētahi whenua kē?,"The correct answer is **C: He rūpahu pea (It might be counterfeit)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""E rua pea ngā raru o ngā anga ingoa-parani nui te kounga e wātea ana ki ngā rohe pērā; ko ētahi he tāruatanga noa iho, ā ko ngā mea tūturu kua kawea mai ka nui ake pea te utu i te utu ki te kāinga.""  This translates to: ""There are potentially two problems with high-brand items available in such regions; some are just fakes, and the genuine ones imported might cost more than the price at home.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E hiahiatia ana pea tētahi whakamātautau whatu tāpiri (An additional vision test may be required):** This is completely unrelated to the passage's discussion of medication and costs.
* **B: Kāore pea te rongoā i te tika mō ētahi tāpare (The medication might not be suitable for some patients):** While this is a valid concern with medication, it's not the *problem* specifically mentioned in the passage regarding buying branded items abroad.
* **D: Kāore pea te Inihua e taupoki i te utu (The NHS might not cover the cost):** The passage mentions the NHS paying for a consultation and prescription, but the issue isn't coverage, it's the *quality* and *price* of the goods themselves.



Therefore, the passage directly points to the possibility of counterfeit goods as a risk when purchasing branded items in other countries."
"E pā ana ki te whakamahi moni i nga Moutere o Falklands, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e tika ana?","The correct answer is **D: I tua atu i te pauna o Falkland, ko te pauna o Ingarangi te moni tino whakaaetia**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ā, ki roto tonu i Stanley ka whakaaetia nuitia ngā kāri nama me ngā tāra o Ngā Whenua Tōpū o Amerika. Ki ngā motu matara kāore pea ngā kāri nama e whakaaetia, ahakoa ka pai pea ngā moni o Peretānia, o Ngā Whenua Tōpū o Amerika hoki...""  This means the British Pound (pauna o Ingarangi) is widely accepted, especially outside of Stanley.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage says cards *may not* be accepted on remote islands, and US dollars *might* be accepted alongside British pounds. It doesn't say only cards and British pounds are accepted.
* **B:** The passage states US dollars *are* widely accepted *in Stanley* along with cards.
* **C:** The passage explicitly states the opposite: ""Kāore nei tonu e taea te whakawhiti i te pūtea Falklands ki waho atu o te moutere, nā reira me whakawhiti koe i ō moni i mua i tō wehenga i ngā moutere"" (Falkland funds cannot be exchanged outside the islands, therefore you must exchange your money before leaving).



"
"I runga anō i te wāhanga nei, ina haere ana ki nga Moutere o Falklands mai i te United States, i hea ka tino whai hua ai tētahi momo utu i tua atu i te kāri nama?","The correct answer is **A: Kei te pātaka FIC West**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka taea te whakawhiti i ngā moni ki ngā moutere, **kei Stanley, kei tua mai i te toa FIC West**."" (You can exchange money on the islands, in Stanley, next to the FIC West shop.) This directly indicates that the FIC West shop is where you can exchange currency.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Puta noa i ngā moutere katoa:** While British Pounds are widely accepted, the passage doesn't say you can *exchange* currency everywhere.
*   **C: I nga moutere o waho:** This refers to outer islands where card acceptance is limited, but doesn't mention exchange.
*   **D: Puta noa i Stanley:** Stanley accepts cards and US dollars, but FIC West is specifically mentioned as the place for currency exchange.



"
Ko tehea huihuinga e kore e honoa ki te whakanui i nga hakari o te temepara?,"The correct answer is **A: Te whānautanga o te arewhana (The birth of the deity)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that temple festivals are celebrated as part of the temple's anniversary, the deity's birthday, or another significant event *related to that temple*. While deities *have* birthdays that are celebrated, the birth of the *structure* (the temple itself - represented here by ""arewhana"") isn't mentioned as a reason for a festival.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Te huritau o te temepara (The temple's anniversary):** Directly stated as a reason for festivals.
*   **C: Te rā whānau o te Atua (The deity's birthday):** Directly stated as a reason for festivals.
*   **D: Ngā takahanga nui e pā ana ki te temepara (Important events related to the temple):** The passage explicitly mentions significant events related to the temple being reasons for celebration.



"
Ki hea kitea ai ngā arewhana rākaitia?,"The correct answer is **B: I roto i nga temepara** (In the temples).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...me te kitea hoki o ngā arewhana kua whakapaingia me ngā pūoro o te temepara..."" (and also to see the decorated arenas and the sounds of the temple and the special ceremonies). This directly links the decorated arenas (""arewhana rākaitia"") to the temples (""temepara"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I ngā wāhi katoa mai i te mutunga o Whiringa-ā-rangi ki waenganui o Mei** (Everywhere from the end of November to mid-May) - This is the *timeframe* of the festivals, not where the arenas are located.
*   **C: I roto i nga hāereere i nga hākari o te temepara** (In the processions during the temple festivals) - While processions are *part* of the festivals, the passage doesn't say the arenas are *in* the processions.
*   **D: I nga tiriti o Kerala** (In the treaties of Kerala) - This is irrelevant to the text.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tēhea o ngā mea e whai ake nei te huarahi tino tika ki te whakaora moni i runga i ngā tīkiti rererangi o te umanga, o te akomanga tuatahi rānei?","The correct answer is **D: Kimi ana i tētahi whakahekenga utu** (Looking for a discount).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kei te nuinga o te wā, kāore he paku take o te rapu noa i ngā hekenga utu mō ngā tūru pakihi, karaehe-tuatahi rānei ki ngā rerenga tōtika i A ki B."" (Often there's no reason not to simply look for discounts for business class or first-class flights on standard routes from A to B).  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kei te utu mā tō kamupene** (Paying with your company) - While mentioned as a *potential* benefit (if your company can pay), the passage doesn't present it as the *most* reliable way to save money. It's more about potential corporate arrangements.
* **B: E tāpui ana i te tauaha tuatahi, kaua ko te umanga** (Avoiding the first class, instead of the company) - This is the opposite of what the passage suggests. The passage is talking about discounts *within* business and first class.
* **C: E tāpui ana i tētahi rere o te karaehe tuatahi kāore i te hāngai** (Avoiding a first-class flight that is not relevant) - This is vague and doesn't directly address the core issue of saving money on these types of flights.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te moumou wā hei rapu ina tāpui i ētahi akoranga utu?","The correct answer is **C: Ngā Whakahekenga (Discounts)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kāore he paku take o te rapu noa i ngā **hekenga utu** mō ngā tūru pakihi, karaehe-tuatahi rānei ki ngā rerenga tōtika i A ki B.""  This translates to ""There's often little point in simply looking for **discounts** for business class or first-class tickets for direct flights from A to B.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā rerenga hāngai (Connecting flights)** - The passage discusses *direct* flights, not connecting ones.
*   **B: tauaha pakihi (Business class)** - While mentioned, the passage is about finding discounts *for* business class, not the class itself being the focus of seeking a deal.
*   **D: tauaha tuatahi (First class)** - Similar to B, this is a class of travel, not what you're actively looking *for* when trying to save money.



"
He aha te mea e kore e hiahiatia kia tāpirihia ina whakataurite ana i te utu katoa mō Āwherika me te utu huri noa i te ao?,"The correct answer is **A: Te utu o ngā visa anō mō ngā wāhi ki waho o Āwherika** (The cost of visas for places outside of Africa).

Here's why:

The text specifically states to *not* forget to add the costs of transit visas, departure taxes, and ground transport ""for all destinations *outside* of Africa"" when comparing costs.  This means visa costs for places outside of Africa are specifically mentioned as something to include in the comparison.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Te utu o ngā takoha haerenga i Āwherika** (The cost of travel gifts in Africa) - The text doesn't mention travel gifts.
* **C: Utu mo te visa o Āwherika** (Visa cost for Africa) -  The comparison *is* to Africa, so visa costs *for* Africa are relevant and would need to be considered.
* **D: Te utu o te haerenga whenua mō ngā tauwāhi i waho o Āwherika** (The cost of ground transport for destinations outside of Africa) - The text *does* explicitly state to include ground transport costs for destinations outside of Africa.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha ngā hokomaha e tīmata ana ki te tuku i tētahi tīpakonga rerekē ake?","The correct answer is **A: Kai kua rite** (Ready-made meals).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kei te piki haere te whiwhi o ngā hokomaha i te kōwhiringa whānui ake o ngā kai kua whakaritea kētia.""  This translates to ""Hokomaha are increasingly offering a wider selection of ready-made meals.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngā oumu ngaruiti** (Microwave ovens) - The passage mentions these *as a way to heat* the ready-made meals, not something the stores are offering.
* **C: Nga wharekai kei runga i te waahi** (Restaurants on site) - The passage mentions these exist in some places, but doesn't say they are a *new offering* from hokomaha.
* **D: Ngā utu utu nui** (Large discounts) - The passage mentions good prices in some places, but not as a new offering from the hokomaha themselves.



"
He aha ngā mea e whakaratohia ana e ētahi toa hokohoko e pai ai ki te kiritaki e hoko ana i ngā kai kua oti te hanga?,"The correct answer is **A: Nga wharekai kei runga i te waahi** (Cafes on site).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ki ētahi whenua, momo toa rānei kei reira tētahi wharekai ki taua wāhi tonu i te itinga iho, he nui ngā wā he mea ōpaki me ngā utu pai.""  This translates to: ""In some countries, or types of stores, there is a cafe on the same site as the store, often with seating and good prices.""  This directly addresses what some stores *provide* to customers buying ready-made food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tīpakonga rerekē iti iho** (Smaller range of options) - The passage says options *increase* with pre-prepared foods, not decrease.
* **C: Ngā kai mata** (Fresh food) - The passage focuses on *prepared* foods, not necessarily fresh ones.
* **D: He oumu ngaruiti** (Microwaves) - While the passage *mentions* microwaves as a possibility, it doesn't say stores *provide* them as a benefit to customers. It's simply a possibility for the customer to use.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kōrero e kore e mārama ki ngā Pirihi me ngā Swiss e kōrero ana i te reo Wīwī?,"The correct answer is **A: Te pūnaha tau Wīwī paerewa (Standard French numbering system)**.

Here's why, based on the provided text:

* **The passage states:** ""kei te pūnaha tatau ki Paratiamu me Huiterangi e reo Wīwī ana ētahi rerekētanga he rerekē i te reo Wīwī e kōrerotia ana ki Wīwī, ā, he āhua rerekē te whakahua o ētahi kupu.""  This translates to: ""In the numbering system in Belgium and Switzerland, there are some differences in the French language compared to the French spoken in France, and some words are pronounced differently.""
*  The passage implies Belgians and Swiss learning French in school are familiar with *standard* French, but they encounter differences in *numbering systems* specific to Belgium and Switzerland.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngā kupu Wīwī Peculiar (Peculiar French words):** The text says there are *different pronunciations* of words, not necessarily entirely different words.
* **C: Ko ētahi āhuatanga o ngā kupu Wīwī (Some aspects of French words):** This is too vague. The passage is more specific about numbering systems.
* **D: Ko te nuinga o te reo Wīwī e kōrerohia ana i Wīwī (Most of the French language spoken in France):** The text highlights differences *from* the French spoken in France, meaning those learning standard French would understand it.



"
"Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei, kāore i te ōrite i Wīwī me te mea kei Wīwī, i Pīkihi rānei?","The correct answer is **B: Te pūnaha tau (The numbering system)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""kei te pūnaha tatau ki Paratiamu me Huiterangi e reo Wīwī ana ētahi rerekētanga he rerekē i te reo Wīwī e kōrerotia ana ki Wīwī"" -  ""in the numbering system in Paraguay and Switzerland, there are some differences in the Wīwī language compared to the Wīwī language spoken in Wīwī."" This means the numbering system (pūnaha tau) *is* different in those places compared to Wīwī itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Te whakakotahitanga o ngā kupu katoa (The combination of all words):** The passage says there are *some* differences, but implies overall consistency and understanding is possible. It doesn't suggest a complete difference in vocabulary.
* **C: Ko te reo Wīwī paerewa e whakaakona ana i ngā kura (The standard Wīwī language taught in schools):** The passage actually states that Belgians and Swiss learn standard Wīwī in school and can understand the simpler version spoken for counting. This implies *similarity* to the Wīwī taught in schools.
* **D: Te takikupu o ētahi kupu Wīwī (The pronunciation of some Wīwī words):** The passage mentions ""he āhua rerekē te whakahua o ētahi kupu"" (a different way of pronouncing some words), but this is a *variation* within the language, not a fundamental difference like a different numbering system.



"
I roto i tehea āhuatanga kaore pea koe e whakawhiwhia ki te utu mo te mate?,"The correct answer is **A: Mēnā kei te rere koe i te WestJet**.

Here's why:

The passage states that WestJet *or* Hau Kānata, Hau Delta Rārangi, and Lufthansa offer bereavement fares. The ""or"" implies WestJet might *not* consistently offer them, unlike the others specifically mentioned as doing so. Therefore, you're less likely to get a bereavement fare with WestJet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage *explicitly* states you **must** call the airline directly.
*   **C:** Lufthansa offers bereavement fares *from the U.S. to Canada*, not the other way around. But the passage doesn't say they *don't* offer them from Paris to the US, just that the stated routes are from the US to Canada.
*   **D:** Hau Delta Rārangi (Delta) is listed as offering bereavement fares.



"
He aha te pono mo nga utu whakangahau?,"The correct answer is **D: Me tono tika ki te kamupene rererangi mā te waea**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""I ngā wā katoa, me whakarite e koe mā te waea tōtika atu ki te kamupene rererangi.""  This translates to ""Always, you must arrange directly by calling the airline company."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E taupoki ana rātau i te utu o te haerenga nehunga** - (They cover the cost of the funeral trip) - The passage doesn't say they *cover* the cost, just that they offer bereavement fares.
* **B: Me tono tika i runga i te paetukutuku a te kamupene rererangi** - (You must request directly on the airline's website) - The passage specifically says to call, not use the website.
* **C: Ka taupokina e rātau te utu o te haerenga o te meneti whakamutunga** - (They cover the cost of last-minute travel) - Similar to A, the passage doesn't say they *cover* the cost, and it's about bereavement fares specifically, not just last-minute travel.



"
He aha te wā e pai ake ai te whakamahi i tētahi pūrere GPS motuhake i tētahi taupānga whakatere GPS?,"The correct answer is **C: Ina puta koe i te awhe** (When you are going out of range).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ki te kore he hononga raraunga mō tō waea, kei waho rānei ia i te wāhi pā, ka whakawhāititia pea te mahi, kāore rānei i te wātea."" (If your phone doesn't have a data connection, or is out of coverage area, its function may be limited, or unavailable.)

This directly points to the benefit of a dedicated GPS device – it *doesn't* rely on cell service, making it better when you're out of range.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ina ngana koe ki te tiaki moni** (When you are trying to save money) - The passage says phone apps *can* be cheaper.
* **B: Ina mōhio koe ka whai hononga raraunga koe** (When you know you will have a data connection) - If you have data, a phone app is fine.
* **D: Ina kāore koe e hiahia ki te rēti i tētahi pūrere** (When you don't want to rent a device) - This isn't about renting, it's about owning vs. using an app.



"
He aha te take e kore ai e pai te whakamahi i tētahi taupānga whakatere GPS hei utu mō tētahi pūrere motuhake?,"The correct answer is **A: Kāore e hiahiatia kia manukanuka mō tētahi hononga raraunga** (You don't have to worry about a data connection).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ki te kore he hononga raraunga mō tō waea, kei waho rānei ia i te wāhi pā, ka whakawhāititia pea te mahi, kāore rānei i te wātea."" (If your phone doesn't have a data connection, or is outside of coverage, the function may be limited or unavailable). 

This directly highlights the *disadvantage* of using a phone's GPS app – its reliance on a data connection. A dedicated GPS device doesn't need this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tiaki moni ana** (Saves money) - While the passage *mentions* saving money, it's not the primary reason why a dedicated GPS might be better.
* **C: Kei te karo i ngā rēti** (Avoiding rentals) - The passage doesn't discuss rentals.
* **D: Kāore e hiahiatia ana kia hoko mahere hōu** (No need to buy new plans) -  This is related to saving money, but the core issue is the data connection, not avoiding plan purchases.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, me pēhea koe e whakaū ai e ōrite ana koe ki tētahi kaipuke tika?","The correct answer is **C: E tāpui ana ki tētahi māngai e tohu ana i te haerenga o Galapagos.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""**Kia mataara ko te kaiwhakarite e whakarite ana i tō haerenga ko tētahi mātanga Galapagos me te mōhiohio pai o te whānuitanga o ngā kaipuke.**"" (Be sure the planner arranging your trip is a Galapagos specialist and has good knowledge of the range of ships.)

This directly suggests using a specialist to ensure you're matched with the right ship. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te tono i roto i tētahi rōpū o ngā pāhihi 8+ he rite ō rātou hiahia** - While group size is mentioned, it's not the primary way to ensure a good ship match.
*   **B: E tāpui ana i te wā iti** - Booking early is suggested, but doesn't guarantee the *right* ship.
*   **D: Kei te tāpui tōmua** - Booking early is suggested, but doesn't guarantee the *right* ship.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore e whakamahia hei āhuatanga hai pupuri i te peti manuhiri?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā tohutohu pēnei i ngā tīkiti kōnohete koreutu** (Free complimentary tickets).

Here's why:

The passage describes casinos using strategies to *keep* people gambling longer. These include:

*   **No windows or clocks:** (Kāore i te kitea ngā wini, ngā karaka rānei) - To disorient and make people lose track of time.
*   **Difficult exits:** (He uaua te kitea o ngā putanga) - To make it harder to leave.
*   **Free services (food, drink, entertainment):** (He ratonga kai, inu, whakangahau motuhake) - To keep people comfortable and staying.
*   **Free alcohol:** (ētahi hingonga ka koha atu i te inu waipiro) - To lower inhibitions.

The passage then contrasts this with the awareness of sensible gamblers who understand the dangers of getting lost in the casino environment.

**Free complimentary tickets (B)** are *not* mentioned as a tactic used by casinos to keep people gambling. In fact, they'd be more of an incentive to *attract* people initially, not necessarily hold them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He nui tonu te mārama māori** (Plenty of dim lighting) – Dim lighting contributes to the disorienting atmosphere described.
*   **C: Ngā inu ā-rua** (Free drinks) – explicitly mentioned.
*   **D: Kāore he karaka** (No clocks) – explicitly mentioned.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te tikanga kia karohia e te tūpāpaku atamai?","The correct answer is **A: He nui rawa te inu waipiro** (Drinking too much alcohol).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tērā ētahi hingonga ka koha atu i te inu waipiro. Heoi, ka riro te tangata i roto i tana haurangi..."" which translates to ""Sometimes offerings include alcoholic beverages. However, the person gets lost in their intoxication...""  This clearly indicates that overconsumption of alcohol is a risk or problem the passage highlights.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kei te whakaae ki ētahi tohutohu** (Following some instructions) - The passage doesn't mention instructions.
* **C: Taki ana i ngā karaka, matawā rānei** (Taking cards, etc.) - While the passage mentions casinos generally try to keep people gambling, it doesn't specifically say people are *taking* cards.
* **D: E pātai ana mō te putanga tata rawa** (Asking for the nearest exit) -  The passage states exits are *difficult to find*, not that people are asking for them. The point is they are designed to be disorienting.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea wāhanga o te whaikōrero e whakapūmatuatia ana i waenganui i te rerenga?","The correct answer is **B: Nouns**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko ngā kupu ingoa katoa...ka tīmata ki te pūmatua, ahakoa kei waenganui i te rerenga.""  This translates to ""All nouns...begin with the head, even in the middle of a sentence."" 

Therefore, the passage specifically identifies **nouns** as being punctuated in the middle of a sentence.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha pea ka uaua ake te pūmatuatanga o nga nouns?","The correct answer is **B: Whakawehe ana i waenga i ngā kupumahi**.

Here's why:

The passage states the capitalization of nouns (including proper nouns like ""Sie"") helps *distinguish them from verbs and other parts of speech*.  This means identifying nouns can be harder when you need to differentiate them from verbs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pānui ana (Reading):** While reading involves encountering nouns, the passage doesn't say reading *makes* noun identification difficult.
* **C: Tuhituhi (Writing):** The passage discusses the *effect* of capitalization on writing, not that writing itself makes nouns difficult to identify.
* **D: Whakawehe ana i waenga i ngā ahanoa (Distinguishing between aspects/things):**  The passage specifically focuses on differentiating nouns from *verbs* (kupumahi), not general ""aspects.""

"""I ngā wāhi tawhiti o Mareia, ko tēhea tohu ā-ringa ko te tikanga """"kua mutu""""?""","The correct answer is **A: Kei te tārewa i te matimati taupū**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P)** describes how in many parts of the world greetings and farewells are common courtesy. However, in parts of Spain, particularly among rural Spaniards, the custom of ""haere mai"" (coming) is used, similar to a bow.  It specifically mentions that a British traveler in Spain might mistakenly use a handshake as a farewell, offering it to the person *they* are shaking hands with (instead of the person being bid farewell to).  The passage implies this is incorrect and that the traditional farewell is akin to a bow – lowering the head (""tārewa"") as a sign of respect, similar to a mathematical compass (""matimati taupū"") lowering.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kei te haere (Going/Traveling):** This doesn't relate to a *symbol* of ending a meeting.
* **C: Kei te whiwhi i te teitei (Gaining height):** This is irrelevant to the context.
* **D: Kei te tuku i ngā kōnui ki runga (Sending knuckles up):** This doesn't fit the description in the passage at all.



Therefore, **A** is the best answer, as it reflects the description of the bowing gesture as a farewell."
"""E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te tohu e tohu ana i te """"hoki mai""""?""","The correct answer is **A: E anga ana ki te kapu e anga whakaroto ana** (It is directed to the cup that is facing inwards).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ka pōhēhē pea te tangata hāereere nō Peretānia ki Pāniora ko te ringaringa hei poroporoaki ko te **kapu e aro ana ki te tangata ringaringa (kaua ki te tangata e ringaringahia ana) hei tuone mō te hoki mai.**""

This translates to: ""...a traveler from Britain to Spain might mistake a handshake for a greeting and the **cup facing the person shaking hands (not the person being shaken) as a signal for returning.**""

Therefore, the cup facing inwards is the signal for ""hoki mai"" (returning).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kei te tārewa matimati taupū:** This doesn't appear in the passage.
*   **C: E poipoi ana i te ringa ki waho:** This describes a handshake, which is mistakenly *thought* to be a greeting.
*   **D: E mau ana i te māhunga:** This doesn't appear in the passage.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te take o te tahu?","The correct answer is **D: Ngā paraka loose** (Loose rocks).

Here's why:

The passage describes how streams flow *down* the volcanic cone (kōpaka tio), encountering obstacles and eventually causing a large section to break off and collapse.  It specifically mentions:

* **""Ka turaki pea ngā pakitara...""** - ""Rocks may crack...""
* **""...me ngā tuanui o ngā ana tio...""** - ""...and the sides of the volcanic holes...""
* **""...ka kapi pea ngā tawhā.""** - ""...and the cliffs may collapse.""

These all point to the instability of the volcanic cone's structure due to **loose rocks (ngā paraka loose)** being the primary cause of the collapse (tahu).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā arawhata huka** (Smoke plumes) - While volcanic cones often have smoke, the passage doesn't link smoke to the collapse.
* **B: Ngā pūhihi tē taea te whakawātea** (Unclear gases) - Gases aren't mentioned as a contributing factor.
* **C: Ngā ana hukapapa mahi** (Working volcanic holes) - The passage refers to holes but doesn't suggest they *cause* the collapse; rather, the sides of these holes are unstable.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e taea te huna e nga arawhata hukarere?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā ana Ice** (Ice caves).

Here's why:

The passage states ""...ka hunaia pea e ngā piriti ā-hukapapa"" which translates to ""...may be hidden by ice formations.""  ""Piriti ā-hukapapa"" directly refers to ice formations.  The passage then describes features *within* these hidden spaces, suggesting they *are* the things being hidden.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā Whāwhā** (Ferns) - Ferns aren't mentioned in the passage as being hidden.
*   **C: Ngā pātū** (Banks/Embankments) - The passage talks about banks breaking *away* from the cave, not being hidden *by* ice.
*   **D: Ngā paraka nui** (Large parks) - Completely unrelated to the passage's description of cave features.



"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, me whiwhi whakatūpato tāpiri ngā haere i mua i te toro atu ki tēhea tauwāhi?","The correct answer is **A: Te puia o Nyiragongo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ahakoa he āhua haumaru a Goma, me rangahau ngā toronga kei waho i Goma hei mārama ki te āhua o te whawhai e haere tonu ana ki te takiwā North Kivu."" and then specifically mentions Nyiragongo as a destination: ""Ko te tāone te pūtake hoki hei piki i te rangitoto, i a Nyiragongo...""

This implies that while Goma itself might be relatively safe, venturing *outside* Goma – specifically to Nyiragongo – requires extra caution due to the ongoing conflict in the North Kivu region.  The text doesn't suggest extra caution is needed for the city center (C), Rwanda (D), or generally ""places surrounding Goma"" (B) as specifically as it does for traveling to the volcano.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e kore e pai ki te tūruhi i Goma?,"The correct answer is **A: He whakangahau ngā whawhai i Kivu ki te Raki** (Ongoing conflicts in North Kivu are a concern).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ahakoa he āhua haumaru a Goma, me rangahau ngā toronga kei waho i Goma hei mārama ki te āhua o te whawhai e haere tonu ana ki te takiwā North Kivu.""  This directly translates to ""Although Goma appears safe, the situations outside of Goma need to be researched to understand the nature of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu region."" This indicates the conflicts are a negative aspect of traveling to/around Goma.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He wāhi pai mō te whai i te Gorilla Mountain i te utu tika** (It is a good place to see Mountain Gorillas at a reasonable price) - The passage *does* mention affordable mountain gorillas are found there.
* **C: He huarahi pai ngā tāke motopaika ki te haere** (Motorbike taxis are a good way to get around) - The passage states boda-bodas (motorbike taxis) are available and cheap.
* **D: Kei te taone te turanga o te puia o Nyiragongo** (The city is at the base of the Nyiragongo volcano) - The passage confirms Goma is a base for climbing Nyiragongo.



"
Ahea ka wātea ai tētahi whakaaetanga mō tētahi rā tīmata i te marama o Akuhata?,"The correct answer is **A: 1 o Hānuere (January 1st)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that permits become available four months before the start month.  If you want a permit for a start date in August (Akuhata), you need to apply four months prior. Four months before August is April. However, the passage then clarifies that permits are released on the first day of the month, four months *before* the start month.  Therefore, permits for May start dates are available January 1st.  This pattern holds for all months – the permits become available on January 1st for all start dates throughout the year.



"
He aha te kaupapahere e noho ana hei pare i te awa?,"The correct answer is **A: He haere tuatahi mai, i te tuatahi i mahi i te pūnaha whakaae** (First-come, first-served, operating on a permit system).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""He pakupaku noa ngā whakaaetanga kua rāhuingia mō ngā tono hīkoi-mai i te āhuatanga ki te taenga mai tuatahi mai."" This translates to ""Only a few permits are reserved for walk-up applications on a first-come, first-served basis."" This directly describes a first-come, first-served policy *within* the permit system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kei te wātea anake ngā whakaaetanga i te 1 o Hānuere** (Permits are only available on January 1st) - This is incorrect. The passage states permits become available *four months before* the start month (January 1st for May starts).
* **C: Ka taea anake te whiwhi whakaaetanga mā ngā tono haere-i roto** (Permits can only be obtained through in-person applications) - This is incorrect. While walk-up applications exist, they are limited.
* **D: He iti noa iho ngā whakaaetanga** (There are very few permits) - While the passage implies permits are limited to manage crowding, it doesn’t define *how* they are allocated, just that walk-ups are limited.

Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e iti rawa te kitea i te momo hotera e whakaahuatia ana i te wāhanga nei?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngā rūma kātahi anō ka whakakāhoretia me ngā whakamohoa hōu** (Recently renovated rooms with modern décor).

Here's why:

The passage describes hotels from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, frequented by the wealthy. It specifically highlights:

* **Old-world charm:** ""Ko ngā whitinga tawhito, ko te koretake o ngā taputapu hou…"" (the old furnishings, the lack of new amenities...)
* **Elegant atmosphere:** ""...i whai tirohanga mārihi ai ngā mea nei."" (…had a refined outlook.)

This indicates the hotels would *not* have had recently renovated rooms with modern décor. They would have been characterized by their age and traditional style.

Let's look at why the other options are *likely* to be found:

* **A: He pae pokowai** (A swimming pool) – Wealthy hotels of that era often included recreational facilities like pools.
* **B: He wharekai gourmet onsite** (An onsite gourmet restaurant) – High-end hotels always catered to their guests with fine dining.
* **C: Hoa manuhiri e tino mōhiotia ana, e mōhiotia ana rānei** (Well-known or recognizable guests) – The passage explicitly states these hotels hosted the wealthy and powerful.



"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i whakaaturia i roto i te whārangi, ko tehea o ngā tuku e whai ake nei ka iti rawa te tūponotanga o ngā manuhiri hotera","The correct answer is **D: Ngā mokatere o te rūma utu nui** (The suites of high-priced rooms).

Here's why:

The passage describes hotels catering to the wealthy – those who could afford train and ocean liner travel. It mentions fine dining and parties. The passage highlights the *exclusivity* and luxury of these hotels, suggesting a small number of very expensive rooms (suites) would house these affluent guests. 

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to have the *smallest* number of guests:

*   **A: Ngā whakarato ārai puta noa i te āhuatanga** (Amenities spread throughout the establishment) - Amenities are used by *all* guests, so many people would utilise them.
*   **B: He wharekai whai kaihoko tino mōhiotia** (A restaurant with highly discerning clientele) - Restaurants, even in luxury hotels, serve a larger number of people.
*   **C: He whakangahau pō e whakahere ana i te pō** (Nightly entertainment events held at night) - Entertainment events would draw a crowd, more people than just staying in a single suite.



The passage focuses on the very wealthy, indicating a limited number of highly exclusive, expensive suites. Therefore, the suites would have the smallest number of guests."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, eaha te tia ia apehia e te mau ratere e mataitai ra i Greenland?","The correct answer is **A: Ko ētahi wāhi e mōhiotia ana mō ngā mokatere hara tiketike** (Some places are known for biting midges).

Here's why:

The text states: ""I te raumati, me mataara hoki ki ngā naenae Nordic. Ahakoa kāore e tuku tahumaero, ka whakararu pea."" This translates to ""In summer, be careful of Nordic midges. Although they don't transmit disease, they can be disruptive.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The text specifically states to bring *warm* clothing, not that the climate is warm year-round.
* **C:** The text states connectivity is *good* (93% have internet access) not that it's unreliable.
* **D:** While the text discusses the problematic use of the word ""Eskimo,"" it doesn't say visitors need to be wary of calling someone that - it says *outsiders* should avoid using the term.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e tino raruraru ana mō ngā haere kāore anō kia rite ki Greenland?","The correct answer is **C: Huarere (Climate)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions several climate-related challenges for unprepared travelers to Greenland:

*   **""kaurere makariri pea te mōrearea tūturu anake ka arohia e te hunga kāore i te whakaritea.""** (The cold weather is perhaps the only real danger noticed by those who are not prepared.)
*   **""he mea waiwai te kawe mai i ngā kākahu he rawaka te mahana.""** (It is worth bringing warm clothing.)
*   **""I runga i ngā rā tino roa ki te raumati ka raru pea kia rawaka te moe, ā, ka pāngia pea e ngā take hauora hāngai.""** (On very long summer days, it can be difficult to sleep and you may be affected by related health issues.)
*   **""I te raumati, me mataara hoki ki ngā naenae Nordic.""** (In summer, be careful of Nordic midges.)

While the passage touches on the remoteness and cultural sensitivities, the *most* significant and directly stated difficulty for unprepared travelers is the **climate**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā waeroa o Nōroa (Nordic Midges):** These are mentioned as a summer concern, but not the *primary* difficulty.
*   **B: Hara (Cost):** The passage doesn't focus on the"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e whakamahia ana ināianei hei marae matua?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ināianei ko tāna mahi ko te wāhi tūmatanui pokapū..."" which translates to ""Now its function is as the central public square...""  Therefore, Jardín de la Unión is currently used as the main plaza.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Te Ara o nga Kihi (Callejon del Beso):** The text describes this as the location of a romantic story, not a plaza.
* **C: Templo de San Diego:** The text states this is the *surviving building* of the 17th-century convent, not the plaza itself.
* **D: Callejon del Beso:**  Same as B - it's a specific location with a story, not the main plaza.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i kitea i Jardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **D: He whare tahito** (A historic house).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Jardín de la Unión... nā tēnei ko te temepara o San Diego te wharenui e tū tonu ana."" (Jardín de la Unión... this is the temple of San Diego which remains the oldest building.) This means there *is* a historic building, but it's a temple, not a generic ""historic house.""
* **The passage mentions:**
    * **A: He gazebo matua me ngā konohete** (A major gazebo and concerts) - ""...he konohete koreutu ka tino whakatūria mai i te whārau pokapū"" (free concerts are regularly staged from the central plaza).
    * **B: Te kāinga o tētahi pūrākau aroha tahito** (The home of an old love story) - ""Callejon del Beso... ko te kāinga o tētahi pakiwaitara aroha tawhito."" (Callejon del Beso... is the home of an old love story).
    * **C: Ngā wharekai anga-kāri** (Food stalls) - ""He maha ngā wharekai e karapoti ana i te māra"" (Many food stalls surround the garden).

Therefore, a general ""historic house"" is not explicitly mentioned as being present in Jardín de la Unión.

"I runga anō i te whakawhitinga, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei mo te rā hīkoi ka whakaarotia he hē?","The correct answer is **D: Kāore te haere hikoi i te rā i te mea pai mō ngā whānau me ngā pēpi** (Day hiking is not good for families with babies).

Here's why:

The passage *specifically states* ""ēngari e tāea ana tētahi haerenga ā-waho mēnā he pēpi, he kōhungahunga rānei"" (but an outdoor trip is possible if you have babies or young children).  Option D directly contradicts this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: E hiahiatia ana he whakaritenga iti mo nga hīkoi o te rā i runga i nga huarahi ngāwari** (Few requirements are needed for day hikes on easy trails) - This is directly stated: ""Mō tētahi hīkoi ā-rā ki tētahi ara māmā kāore he tino whakaritenga e hiahiatia ana.""
* **B: He rerekē ngā tawhiti, engari i whakaritea kia taupokina i roto i te rā kotahi** (Distances vary, but are designed to be completed in one day) - The passage says ""Ko te hīkoi rā...tae atu ki ngā roanga roa ake ka taea te hīkoi i te rangi kotahi.""
* **C: Ko te nuinga o te wā ka taea e te hunga e tino kaha ana te mahi i tēnei mahi** (Usually people who are quite fit can do this activity) - The passage implies this by saying ""ka taea e tētahi tangata e āhua whiti ana te manawa reka i ērā."" (a person in good shape can enjoy them).



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, āhea te hīkoi o te rā e tino hiahiatia ana he whakaritenga iti rawa?","The correct answer is **B: Ina pā ki tētahi huarahi ngāwari ake** (When it's on an easier trail).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mō tētahi hīkoi ā-rā ki tētahi ara māmā kāore he tino whakaritenga e hiahiatia ana, ā, ka taea e tētahi tangata e āhua whiti ana te manawa reka i ērā.""  This translates to: ""For a day hike on an easy trail, no special requirements are needed, and a reasonably fit person can enjoy their time on them.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ina uru ā-tinana te hīkoi** (When the hike is physically demanding) - The passage says easier hikes have fewer requirements, not harder ones.
*   **C: Ina haere nga tamariki i runga i te hīkoi** (When children are on the hike) - The passage states families *need more* preparation when hiking with young children.
*   **D: I te wā e haere ana i roto i tētahi taiao māori ake** (When hiking in a more traditional Māori environment) - While the passage mentions Māori environments, it doesn't link them to fewer requirements.

"He aha te rerekētanga o ngā papa i Rogaland, i Agder rānei ki te toenga o Norway?","The correct answer is **D: I te nuinga o te wā e hīpokina ana rātau i roto i te hea**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ki Rogaland me Agder i te nuinga o te wā kua whakaingoatia """"hei"""" ko tōna tikanga he whenua pakihi rākau kore e ūhia ana ki te putiputi waiporoporo, ki te heta.""  This translates to ""In Rogaland and Agder, it is often called """"hei"""", meaning a grassy area without trees, covered with heather.""

This directly indicates that the difference in Rogaland and Agder is that these areas are *typically covered in heather* (hea).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He rākau a rātau** - Incorrect. The passage specifically says they *lack* trees.
*   **B: Kaore he mura** - Incorrect. The passage doesn't mention anything about a lack of moss.
*   **C: Ko te nuinga o nga pereti, ahakoa** - This doesn't relate to the described difference.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i te āhua o Norway?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā pereti ngahere (Forest plateaus)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes Norwegian landscapes as having:

*   **Tai matapari me ngā kōawaawa paripari** (Coastal shores and steep valleys - fjords)
*   **Mānia teitei, āhua papa** (High, flat plains - ""vidde"")
*   **Hei** (Moorlands - heathland with heather)

The passage specifically states that ""hei"" is *land pakihi rākau kore* (woodland-free land), meaning it doesn't have forests.  Therefore, ""forest plateaus"" (ngā pereti ngahere) are *not* characteristic of the landscape described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: Whakatuwheratia ngā hua whenua (Open landscapes)** -  The ""vidde"" are described as open and vast, fitting this.
*   **C: Ngā fjords mau tonu (Steep fjords)** - The passage explicitly mentions fjords.
*   **D: Moorlands** -  The passage directly refers to ""hei"" which are moorlands.



"
Āhea nga tūruhi e hiahia ana ki te haere ki nga pou maunga?,"The correct answer is **C: I te raumati o Īnia**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te wā tūruhi mō te teihana hiwi i te nuinga o te wā ka piki i te raumati o Inia."" This translates to: ""The tourist season for hill stations generally peaks in the summer of India.""

Therefore, the passage directly indicates people want to go to hill stations during the Indian summer.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, āhea tonu te nuinga o nga tūruhi i nga pou maunga?","The correct answer is **C: I te raumati o Īnia**.

The passage states: ""Ko te wā tūruhi mō te teihana hiwi i te nuinga o te wā ka piki i te raumati o Inia.""  This directly translates to ""The time for mountain stations usually increases in the summer of India.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I te wā o te hukarere taumaha** (During heavy snowfall) - The passage mentions snowfall *in winter*, but doesn't say that's when tourism is highest.
* **B: Puta noa i te wā papa huka** (Throughout the snowy period) - Similar to A, this relates to winter conditions, not peak tourism.
* **D: Puta noa i ngā marama o te hōtoke** (Throughout the months of February) -  This is a specific winter month and isn't mentioned as the peak season.



"
He aha te mea e ārai ai koe ki te tūmanako koe kia kitea he poti e rapu āwhina ana?,"The correct answer is **C: Pānui ana i ō ratonga** (Advertising your services).

Here's why:

The passage (P) describes actively *putting yourself out there* to find a boat needing help:

*   ""Ko tāu noa he whakapiri pānui e ruku ana i tō āwhina"" - ""All you do is post an ad offering your help...""
*   Going to marinas, talking to boat owners, contacting marinas, etc. are all *ways* to advertise and get the word out.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E haere ana, whakararo ana i nga tauranga** (Going, lowering the moorings) - This is a task *you might do* once you *find* a boat, not how you find one.
*   **B: Ngā kāpene hoa** (Friendly captains) - While friendly captains are helpful, the passage emphasizes actively *seeking* work, not relying on connections.
*   **D: E mōhio ana ki ngā hoa poti e pā ana ki te waka** (Knowing boat-owning friends) - Again, relying on friends isn't the main strategy outlined in the passage.



Therefore, the passage directly states the initial step is advertising your services to attract boats needing help."
He aha tāu e mahi ai i nga marina ina rapu poti e hiahia ana ki te āwhina?,"The correct answer is **A: Whakapā atu ki ngā hēramana** (Contact the skippers/captains).

Here's why:

The passage (P) specifically states: ""...te ngana ki te whakapā atu ki ngā hēramana ki ngā pāparakauta..."" which translates to ""...try to contact the skippers/captains at the marinas...""  This is a direct instruction from the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Noho i raro i te hihiani** (Stay under the radar) - The passage encourages actively seeking people out, not being discreet.
* **C: Whakatata anake ki ngā tāngata i a rātau e horoi ana i to rātau yacht** (Only approach people while they are washing their yacht) - While mentioned as *an example* of things to do, it's not the main focus or only action. The passage says to talk to *many* people.
* **D: Karohia ngā hoa patuchhikers** (Look for hitchhikers) -  This isn't mentioned at all in the passage.



"
Ko tēhea tauwāhi e tono ana ki tētahi tūruhi e hiahia ana ki te hītori kawanatanga o te motu?,"The correct answer is **A: Te taha ki te Raki**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Koinei te wāhi i tangohia e te hunga koroniara nō Peretānia mō rātou anō, nō reira ki te rapu koe i te taunakitanga o te hītori koroniara o te takiwā, koinei tētahi wāhi pai hei tīmata.""  This translates to: ""This was the area taken by the British colonizers for themselves, therefore if you are looking for evidence of the colonial history of the area, this is a good place to start.""  ""Te taha ki te Raki"" (the north side) refers to this area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Te wai o Kowloon (Kowloon waters):** While Kowloon is mentioned for views, it's not specifically tied to colonial history in the passage.
*   **C: Te Taone o Hong Kong (Hong Kong Island):** The passage says the north side *of* Hong Kong Island is where the colonial history is found, not the entire island.
*   **D: Wikitōria Harbor (Victoria Harbour):**  Victoria Harbour is a landmark but doesn't directly relate to the area where colonial history can be explored.



"
He aha te wāhi e ahuareka ai ki te tūruhi e aro nui ana ki ngā tirohanga whakamiharo?,"The correct answer is **D: Te wai o Kowloon**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ki te kite i ngā tirohanga rawe rawa atu o Hong Kong, me wehe i te motu ka haere ai ki te tāhuna Kowloon kei tērā atu taha."" 

This translates to: ""To see the most spectacular views of Hong Kong, you must leave the island and go to the Kowloon side.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wikitōria Harbor:** While mentioned, the passage says views are best *from* Kowloon *of* Victoria Harbour, not that the harbour *is* the place to go for views.
*   **B: Hong Kong e tika ana:** This is too general - the passage specifies a particular location.
*   **C: Te Motu o Hong Kong:** The passage states you need to *leave* the island to get the best views.

He aha ngā āhuatanga o ētahi tūru e āwhina ana ki te whakaiti i te mōrearea o te waewae o te kaieke kia mau ki te tūru?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngā pae haumaru** (Safety stirrups).

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions that some stirrups, *like English stirrups*, have a release mechanism (""pā marutau"") that allows the stirrup to release if the rider's foot gets caught, reducing the risk of being dragged. This directly relates to safety features designed to prevent a rider's foot from being stuck in the stirrup.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā kapu Whāiti** (Small caps) - This refers to helmets, mentioned as general safety equipment, but not specifically for preventing foot entrapment.
*   **C: Ngā whakaoho a Leather** (Leather fastenings) - This is a general material description and doesn’t relate to safety features.
*   **D: Taimautanga nui ake** (Greater flexibility) - While flexibility is good, it doesn’t directly address the problem of a foot getting stuck.



"
He aha te āhuatanga o te hu eke e āwhina ana ki te whakapiki ake i te haumaru o te kaieke i te wā e whakamahi ana i ngā rākau?,"The correct answer is **B: Kirikau**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions: ""...*ētahi terapēke, inarā ko ngā terapēke Ingarihi, he pā marutau ōna e āhei ai te tarapu kirikau te taka i te terapēke mēnā kua tōia whakamuritia e tētahi kai eke e taka ana.*"" ( ...some stirrups, especially English stirrups, have a rubber band that allows the stirrup iron to fall off the stirrup if a rider falling pulls backwards). This describes a safety feature *of the stirrup itself* (kirikau) that releases the foot in a fall, increasing safety.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He tōraro, he whāiti anake** - (A narrow only) - The passage doesn't mention stirrup width as a safety feature.
*   **C: He rekereke** - (A rein) - Reins are for steering, not directly related to stirrup safety.
*   **D: He whānui anake** - (A wide only) -  Like option A, width isn't a focus in the passage's discussion of safety.

He aha te tukunga ki ngā haere mā ngā whatunga whakawhiti manaaki?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngā hononga ki ētahi atu kaihaereere e toro ana ki te ūnga kotahi** (Connections to other travellers visiting the same place).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the kōtuitui whakawhiti manaakitanga (hospitality exchange networks) connect travellers with locals.** This inherently means connecting with *other* travellers who are also in that location.  The whole point is finding hosts and potentially meeting fellow travellers through those hosts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā Whakaritenga me ngā mano paetata (Arrangements and close friends):** While you *might* make friends, that's not the primary function described. It's about the *potential* for connection, not guaranteed arrangements with close friends.
* **B: rerenga māmā (easy flights):**  The passage focuses on *accommodation*, not transportation.
* **C: Ngā haereere i tukuna e ngā kaiārahi paetata (Trips offered by local guides):** The passage focuses on *staying with locals*, not being guided by them.



"
"I runga anō i te whakawhitinga, ko tēhea o ngā tauākī e whai ake nei e pā ana ki ngā whatunga whakawhiti manaaki ehara i te tika?","The correct answer is **A: Ka whakaratohia tonu ngā kaihaerere ki ngā tohutoro mō ngā kaihautū o te rohe.** (Travelers are always provided with references for local hosts.)

Here's why:

The passage states hosts are *found* through networks like Couchsurfing, and reviews *may* be available. It doesn't say travelers are *always* provided with references.  The text focuses on the connection being made *through* the network, not pre-vetted references being automatically given.

Let's look at why the other options are correct and supported by the text:

* **B: Tērā pea ka hiahiatia e ētahi whatunga he tirotiro anō i ngā kaihaere** (Some networks may require further screening of travelers) - The text mentions some networks may require additional setup, implying screening.
* **C: Ka whakaratohia ki ngā kaihaereere he rārangi o ngā kaihautū e wātea ana i te tāone ūnga** (Travelers are provided with a list of hosts available in the arrival city) - The passage says hosts become available ""through the web or online,"" indicating a list or accessible directory.
* **D: I ētahi wā e wātea ana ngā arotake o ngā kaihautū o te rohe ki ngā kaihaerere** (Reviews of local hosts are sometimes available to travelers) - The text explicitly mentions ""reviews from other travelers.""



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea momo manuhiri e kitea ana i roto i tētahi rūma whare noho tiri?","The correct answer is **C: He manuhiri e haere ana me nga tamariki iti** (Guests travelling with small children).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Me uaua te kite i ngā whānau whai tamariki, engari ka whakaaetia rātou e ētahi wharenoho ki ngā rūma tūmataiti."" This translates to: ""It is rare to see families with children, but some hostels do accept them in smaller rooms.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He manuhiri i roto i o rātau rua tekau mā rua** (Guests in their twenties) - While the passage mentions 20-year-olds being the typical age, it doesn't limit guests *to* that age.
*   **B: He manuhiri e haere takitahi ana** (Guests travelling alone) - The passage doesn't mention anything about solo travellers.
*   **D: He manuhiri i roto i o rātau whare waenganui** (Guests in their middle age) - The passage states older people are sometimes seen, but doesn't focus on middle-aged guests.



"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, ko wai e tino noho ana i te whare noho?","The correct answer is **B: E toru ngā taitamariki 22 tau e haere tahi ana.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ko te nuingā o te wā, 20 tau te pakeke o te manuhiri"" (generally, the guest is 20 years old).
* **Option B** directly reflects this – three young adults aged 22.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A:** A couple and a new family doesn't fit the typical age range.
    * **C:** A couple in their 70s are described as occasionally being seen, but not the primary demographic.
    * **D:** Families with children are *uncommon* and only accepted in small rooms by some hostels.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e whakamārama tika ana i te maka pūkei?","The correct answer is **A: Ka hoki mai tonu ki tō ringa mēnā ka tika te maka**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ki te hiahia koe ki te ako ki te whiu i tētahi pumarangi ka hokihoki mai ki tō ringa, whakaritea he pumarangi tāu e tika ana mō te hokihoki.""  This directly translates to: ""If you want to learn to sculpt a boomerang that will return to your hand, make sure the boomerang is suitable for returning.""  ""Maka"" refers to the boomerang, and ""tika"" means suitable or correct.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He pai ake ki waenganui i nga tūruhi i nga tūruhi** - This doesn't relate to the text's focus on the boomerang's properties.
* **C: Kaore he maha o ngā pukumahi e wātea ana i Ahitereiria** -  The text mentions limited availability of boomerangs in Australia, but this isn’t the *main* point about what makes a boomerang return.
* **D: Ko ētahi o ngā pukumahi anake e āhei ana ki te hoki mai** - While true, the passage focuses on ensuring *your* boomerang is correct to return, not just that some boomerangs can.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e whakamahia nuitia ana i roto i te kai o Javanese?,"The correct answer is **C: huka kōkona** (coconut sugar).

The passage specifically mentions ""huka (inarā ko te huka kokonati Javanese)"" – which translates to sugar (specifically Javanese coconut sugar). This indicates coconut sugar is a key ingredient in Javanese cuisine.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: huka mā** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: huka kua pau** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: huka parauri** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he pēhea te horahanga o te mate ārai?","The correct answer is **B: Pathogens**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te mate hōrapa tētahi tahumaero nā tētahi **tukumate** te take..."" which translates to ""An infectious disease is a condition caused by a **pathogen**..."" 

* **Pathogens** are the agents that *cause* infectious diseases (like bacteria, viruses, fungi etc.). The passage directly links the spread of disease to these pathogens.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā tāngata i pāngia (People affected)** - While people are *affected* by the disease, they aren't how it spreads.
* **C: Kocterium (Bacterium)** -  This is *a type* of pathogen, but the passage speaks of pathogens generally, not just bacteria.
* **D: Ngā Vaccinations (Vaccinations)** - Vaccinations *prevent* disease spread, they don't *cause* it.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea kāore i te mōhiotia he mate urutā?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā Vaccinations (Vaccinations)**.

Here's why:

The passage explains that infectious diseases are *caused* by pathogens like bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc. It also mentions governments implementing measures related to these diseases.  Vaccinations are a *prevention* against infectious diseases, not a cause of them. The passage doesn't state anyone would be unaware of vaccinations being related to infectious disease - rather, it focuses on the agents *that cause* infectious disease.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ngā Viruses (Viruses):** The passage explicitly lists viruses as a cause of infectious diseases (""pēnei i te huaketo..."").
*   **C: Bacteria (Bacteria):**  Similarly, bacteria (""ngārara"") are also mentioned as a cause.
*   **D: Fungus (Fungus):** Fungi (""hekaheka"") are also listed as a cause.



"
I roto i tehea āhuatanga ka nui ake te whiriwhiri i te proxy tukutuku i te kaiwhakarato VPN whaiaro mo te kaiwhakamahi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ko te kaiwhakamahi te arataki i te waka http**.

Here's why:

The passage states that VPNs route *all* internet traffic (not just HTTP).  A web proxy, on the other hand, typically only handles HTTP traffic.  Therefore, if a user *only* needs to route HTTP traffic, a web proxy is sufficient and likely a simpler, cheaper solution than a full VPN.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E hiahia ana te kaiwhakamahi ki te whakawhiti i te waka katoa** - This describes a situation where a VPN is *better* suited, not a proxy.
* **B: Kei te āwangawanga te kaiwhakamahi ki te karo i te aukatinga me te tutei i te nuinga e taea ana** - VPNs generally offer stronger privacy and security than proxies, making them better for avoiding censorship.
* **D: E hiahiatia ana e te ngohe a te kaiwhakamahi he āhua ngāwari ki te taumata teitei o te hōkaiipurangi** - VPNs are more difficult to detect (the passage notes they are harder to trace), so a proxy wouldn't be suitable if avoiding detection is important.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā tauākī e whai ake nei mō ngā VPN me ngā takawaenga tukutuku ehara i te tika?","The correct answer is **D: Ka taea anake e ngā VPNs te tiki anō i ngā whakawhitinga http**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that VPNs ""Ka whakatika i ngā ara mō te hohonga Ipurangi, kaua ko te http anake."" (fix routes for Internet browsing, not just http only). This directly contradicts option D, which claims VPNs *only* handle http traffic.

Let's look at why the other options are correct and supported by the text:

*   **A: Ko te tikanga he nui ake te bandwidth o ngā VPN i ngā proxy tukutuku** - The passage says VPNs often offer ""te pēne whānui ake"" (wider bandwidth)
*   **B: Kāore e taea e ngā proxy tukutuku te huri i te katoa o te waka tukutuku** - The passage implies this by highlighting VPNs as being more comprehensive.
*   **C: He iti ake te kounga o te ratonga o ngā proxy tukutuku i ngā VPN** - The passage states VPNs generally have ""te kounga pai ake o te ratonga"" (better quality of service).



"
He aha ka taea e tētahi te whakamahi i tētahi kamupene waea i waho o tō rātou rohe ināianei tonu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā waea ararere Ipurangi (VoIP - Voice over Internet Protocol)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Nā te mea kua tukunga ngā waea mā te ipurangi, kāore koe me whakamahi i tētahi wāea kamupene kei te wāhi e noho nei koe ki te wāhi rānei e haere nei koe."" (Because calls can be made over the internet, you don't need to use a company phone in the place you live or travel to.)  This directly points to internet-based calling as the solution to using a phone number outside your current location.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngā tau waea huri noa (Ported phone numbers):** The passage *mentions* needing to purchase a local area code, which implies porting *could* be necessary for some calls, but VoIP is the primary method allowing location independence.
* **C: Ngā Aorangi (Airplanes):** This is irrelevant to the topic of phone numbers and location.
* **D: Ngā waea PSTN (PSTN phones):**  The passage implies PSTN phones *limit* you to a specific location (""me hoko anō koe i tētahi tau ā-ao..."").



"
"E ai ki te whakawhitinga, he aha pea me mahi kia whiwhi ai i ētahi waea?","The correct answer is **D: Hokona he waea PSTN**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He nui ngā wā, me hoko anō koe i tētahi tau ā-ao e whakaae ana kia waea atu ngā waea PSTN ki a koe.""  This directly translates to ""Often, you still need to buy a local area code that allows PSTN calls to reach you.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hokona he tau huri noa:** The passage mentions getting area codes from where you *are*, not just any area code.
*   **B: Whakamahia he kamupene waea paetata:** The passage discusses *avoiding* using a local company phone, as the point is using internet-based phones.
*   **C: Kei te whiwhi tau mai i tō iwi paetata:** The passage mentions a local area code from your *community*, but not necessarily your tribe/iwi.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kupu e kore e tika te whakahua i ngā kupu o Ingarangi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka māminga pea ngā kupu whai reta c me te g**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Ko ngā reta matua me mataara ko te c me te g, i te mea e rerekē ai te whakahuatanga e ai ki te oropuare e whai ake ana.""  This translates to ""The main letters to be careful with are c and g, because the pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows.""  This directly indicates that words with 'c' and 'g' are likely to be mispronounced.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He rerekē te kōrero o te r taurua i te r kotahi** (The pronunciation of a double r is different from a single r) - While true (as the example *caro* vs. *carro* shows), this is *an example* of a difficulty, not the core issue the passage highlights.
* **B: Ko te nuinga o ngā kupu e kōrerotia ana me pēhea te tuhituhi** (Most words are pronounced as they are written) - This is the *opposite* of what the passage says; the passage points out that pronunciation *doesn't* always follow spelling.
* **D: He rerekē te whakahua o te nuinga o ngā kupu i runga anō i te rerenga reo e whai ake nei** (The pronunciation of most words changes depending on the following syllable) - This is a true statement according to the passage, but 'c' and 'g' are specifically highlighted as the *letters* causing the change, making option C more precise.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā āhuatanga e whai ake nei o Izmir i puta i mua i te rā hou?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngā whare e whakaatu ana i ngā aroaro karaehe** (Buildings displaying stone facades).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko ngā huarahi whānui, ko ngā whare he karāhe te pakitara o mua..."" This directly translates to ""The broad avenues, the houses have stone facades...""  This indicates the stone facades are an older feature of the city.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā boulevards whānui** (Broad boulevards) - While present, the passage doesn't specify they were there *before* the modern era. They are simply a characteristic of the city now.
*   **C: Ngā pokapū hokohoko** (Shopping centers) - The passage mentions *new* shopping centers (""pokapū hokohoko hou""), meaning they are a recent development.
*   **D: Ngā tuanui kua oti te whero** (Red brick chimneys) - The passage describes them as being *among* the older features (alongside the 18th-century market and old mosques) but doesn't state they predate the modern city.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei ehara i te āhuatanga tika o Izmir?,"The correct answer is **B: Ko te hau e whakaatu ana i nga tikanga o Turkey**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...kei te tāone nui te wairua ka nui ake te Mediterranean Europe i te Tākei o mua."" ( ""...the city has a spirit that is more Mediterranean European than old Turkey."") This directly contradicts the idea that the atmosphere strongly reflects Turkish customs.

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct based on the passage:

* **A: E karapoti ana te taone i te whanga nui** - ""...kei te takiwa o tētahi koko nui..."" ( ""...located in the region of a large gulf..."")
* **C: Ka kitea e koe ngā pokapū hokohoko hou me ngā hahi tawhito** - ""...me ngā pokapū hokohoko hou e kōtingotingo ana i waenga i ngā tuanui papauku-whero, me ngā mosque me ngā whare karakia tawhito..."" (...and the new shopping centers glittering between the terracotta-red alleys, and the old mosques and churches...)
* **D: Kei a ia te tauranga tuarua nui rawa atu i Turkey** - ""Ko Izmir te tāone nui he tuatoru tōna rahi ki Turkey..."" (Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey...) - meaning it has the second largest port after Istanbul.



"
Ko te kupu hanami e pā ana ki te tirohanga o te aha?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngā puawai Plum** (Plum blossoms).

Here's why:

The text states: ""I ahu mai te whakaaro nei i Haina ko reira whiriwhiri ai te putiputi paramu hei kōwhiringa pua."" This translates to ""The idea originated in China where the plum blossom was chosen as the flower.""  Hanami, as described in the text, initially focused on appreciating plum blossoms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: nga puawai here** (cherry blossoms) - While hanami *eventually* became associated with cherry blossoms, the text specifically states the practice *originated* with plum blossoms.
*   **B: Kāwanatanga o Tiapanī** (Japanese Government) - The text doesn't connect hanami to the government.
*   **D: Te Kōti Imperial** (Imperial Court) - While the Imperial Court *later* enjoyed plum blossoms, the question asks what hanami *originally* related to.



"
Na wai i taurima nga rōpū tuatahi i whakatapua ki te tirotiro i nga puawai cherry?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngā aristocrats Hapanihi** (Japanese aristocrats).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ki Hapāni, ko te pua puaina tuatahi nā te emepara i whakatū mōna anake, me ōna apataki o te kāhui ariki me te kōti teitei.""  This translates to ""In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing was established for the emperor alone, and his associates of the aristocratic class and the high court.""

Therefore, it was the Japanese aristocrats who initially practiced *hanami*.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā aronga e whai ake nei o Jerusalem te iti rawa o te kawe tāpoi?","The correct answer is **A: Te tikanga whakapono o te taone** (The city's religious significance).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states Jerusalem is holy to three major religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) and is a spiritual center. This suggests a *high* level of attraction for tourists *because* of its religious significance, not a low one. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ko tōna tūnga hei taone matua o Iharaira** (Its status as Israel's capital) - The passage acknowledges this status, even while noting international disagreement, implying it's a point of interest.
* **C: Ana whakahere ahurea** (Its cultural fabric) - The passage mentions Jerusalem is a cultural center.
* **D: Ngā pae hītori maha** (Its many historical sites) - The passage directly states Jerusalem has ""many historical places"" and is a major tourist destination *because* of its history.

The passage does *not* suggest anything that would make its religious significance a deterrent to tourism; quite the opposite. Therefore, the religious significance is the least likely to be a factor leading to low tourist numbers.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e kore e whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga nei hei mea e mōhiotia ana a Jerusalem?,"The correct answer is **B: āhuatanga tōrangapū (political features)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on:**
    * **Hītori e whakahē ana (Controversial history):** It mentions the dispute over Jerusalem's status as Israel's capital.
    * **tikanga whakapono (Religious significance):** It explicitly states the city is holy to three religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) and a spiritual center.
    * **Ngā pae ahurea (Cultural aspects):** It mentions cultural sites, markets, cafes, and restaurants.

* **The passage *does not* discuss:**
    * **Political features:** While the passage acknowledges the capital dispute, it doesn't delve into the political systems, governance, or specific political issues within Jerusalem.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea momo haere e kore e whai hua mai i te hoko Kāri Moho?","The correct answer is **B: He tangata haere e toro ana ki Kruger National Park anake**.

Here's why:

The passage states a Wild Card is beneficial as it allows access to *multiple* parks in South Africa, or *all* of the South African National Parks.  Someone only visiting Kruger National Park wouldn't benefit from the multi-park access offered by the Wild Card; they'd likely be better off paying the single entry fee.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** This is the *opposite* of someone who wouldn't benefit. Visiting many SANParks is exactly who the Wild Card is for.
* **C:** Budget travellers might *benefit* from the Wild Card if it offers overall savings.
* **D:**  Visiting Kruger *and* another park is a perfect scenario for using a Wild Card.



"
Ko tēhea kōrero e kore e tino whakaahua i te Kruger National Park?,"The correct answer is **C: Ko te iti rawa o ngā Pāka ā-Motu o Awherika ki te Tonga** (It is the smallest of the South African National Parks).

Here's why:

* **The passage states the Kruger National Park is a *major* attraction of South Africa and a *flagship* component of SANParks.** This implies it's significant and likely *not* the smallest. It's 19,500 km² in size – a very large area.

Let's look at why the other options are correct and supported by the text:

* **A: E whakaarotia ana he tāwhara matua o Awherika ki te Tonga** (It is considered a major attraction of South Africa) - The passage explicitly states this.
* **B: He rerekē te waiora i waenganui i nga ecozones maha o te pāka** (The wildlife differs between the many ecozones of the park) - The passage says the park is divided into 14 different ecozones, each with different animals.
* **D: Ka taea e ngā manuhiri mā te hokonga o tētahi Kāri Mohoho** (Visitors can gain access by purchasing a Wild Card) - The passage details the Wild Card option for entry.



Therefore, option C is the statement that the passage *does not* support and is, in fact, likely incorrect."
Ko tehea o ēnei e tino mōrearea ana mō ngā kaieke i ngā wāhanga pakari o te maunga?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā here mākū (Slippery patches)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ahakoa tēnā, ka korehāhā koe, me matāra hoki i ngā wāhi hōhonu, **inā koa ka mākū ana, ka tere taka ai koe ki te raruraru**."" This translates to ""Even so, you will be breathless and need to be careful in the deep places, **because if it's slippery, you can quickly fall into trouble**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngā hipanga pōhatu (Stone steps):** While the path *has* stone steps, they are described as being laid out for much of the way – not a hazard.
* **C: Ngā ana iti (Small caves):** The passage mentions a small cave near the summit, but it's described as a ""nook"" or ""hole"" and doesn't indicate it's dangerous.
* **D: Ngā taura Tīra (Tyre ropes):** The ropes are *helping* with the climb, providing support, not posing a danger.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e kore e tino whakaatu i te piki o te maunga o Machu Picchu e whakaahuatia ana i te wāhanga nei?,"The correct answer is **A: Ahakoa ko nga kaipiki e tika ana, tērā pea ka puta i te manawa** (Even if climbers are careful, accidents can happen).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the difficulty and danger of the climb.** It states you need to be careful, watch your footing, and that a fall could be serious. While accidents *could* happen, the passage doesn’t specifically mention that even careful climbers are prone to accidents. It stresses *taking* care to avoid them.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

* **B: Kaore he tuhi ā ringa puta noa i nga wāhanga poupou ake** (There are no handholds along the steeper sections) -  The text states ""ki ngā wāhi paripari ake he taura tīra hei puringa ā-ringa tautoko"" (in the steeper sections there are ropes as supporting handholds) which is the opposite of this statement.
* **C: Me puta koe i te ana i runga** (You must exit through a small cave at the top) -  The passage says ""He ana paku rawa tata ki te tihi me puta, ā, he āhua pāpaka, he kōpē"" (There is a small cave near the top you must go through, it’s a narrow, steep opening).
* **D: Ka mōrearea nga wāhanga poupou ake ina mākū** (The steeper sections are slippery when wet) - The passage says ""me matāra hoki i ngā wāhi hōhonu, inā koa ka mākū ana, ka tere taka ai koe ki te raruraru"" (be careful in the deep places, especially if it's wet, you could easily slip into trouble).



Therefore, option A is the statement least supported by the provided text."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ehara ēnei i te tēpara matua o te kai a Majorcan?","The correct answer is **C: Pata**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the main components of Majorcan cuisine are bread, vegetables, and *meat* (specifically pork), and olive oil. It doesn't mention potatoes (""pata"") as a core element. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mīti (Meat):** The passage clearly identifies meat (pork) as a core component.
*   **B: Parāoa (Bread):** Bread is stated as a primary food.
*   **D: Ngā Ka taea te mahi (Accompaniments):** The example of *Pa amb Oli* shows that toppings and sides are important, but they aren't the *base* of the cuisine, just additions to the bread.



"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i roto i te wāhanga nei, ko tehea kōrero e pā ana ki ngā kai Hangi ehara i te mea pono?","The correct answer is **C: I te nuinga o te wā e tunua ana ngā hapa tīpokapoka mā te whakamahi i te tautau.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states the hāngī is used to cook a *traditional* meal.** While hāngī can be used for many types of food, the passage doesn't specifically mention cooking pork chops (hapa tīpokapoka) with a hāngī. It focuses on the traditional method.

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct based on the passage:

* **A: Ka whakamahia e te tautau puia he pōhatu wera mai i te ahi hai wera i te rua** - This is directly stated in the passage: ""Ka whakamahanatia te rua ki ngā kōhatu wera mai i tētahi ahi..."" (The hole is heated with hot stones from a fire...)
* **B: E wātea ana a Hangi mā te whakamahi pōhatu wera i Pōneke** - The passage states hāngī are available in places like Ōtautahi (Christchurch) and Pōneke (Wellington).
* **D: Ka kitea te hangi puia i Rotorua** -  The passage specifically mentions ""Kei ētahi wāhi ki Rotorua he hāngī ngāwhā"" (There are geothermal hāngī in places in Rotorua).



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i whakahuatia hei huarahi noa hei whakawera i te poka Hangi?,"The correct answer is **A: korohū**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ka whakamahanatia te rua ki ngā kōhatu wera mai i tētahi ahi, tērā rānei ki ētahi wāhi ka wera noa mai ngā wāhi o te whenua i te mahana ngāwhā."" (The pit is heated with hot stones from a fire, or from places that are naturally heated from the earth's geothermal heat.)
* This describes using **hot stones (Ngā pōhatu wera)** and **geothermal heat (wera puia/ngāwhā)** to heat the hāngī.
* **Korohū** (coal) is *not* mentioned in the passage as a method for heating a hāngī.

Therefore, korohū is the one method *not* described in the text.  Note that options B and D are essentially the same thing.



"
"He aha pea te hua o te āhukahuka motuhake mai i te monk, i te nunui rānei?","The correct answer is **D: E mau ana i te panekoti e tapahia ana i runga ake i te turi** (They are wearing a cloak draped over their heads and shoulders).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""I te wā e toro ana ki ngā whare monaki, e hiahiatia ana te wahine ki te mau panekoti e uwhi ana i ngā turi, ā, kei te uwhia hoki ō rātou pakihiwi."" (When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear cloaks covering their heads, and also covering their shoulders).  This directly describes the clothing mentioned in option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E mau ana i tētahi tākai hipa kanapa** (They are wearing a hemp rope) - The passage doesn't mention ropes.
*   **B: Kei te taupoki i ō pakihiwi** (They are covering their shoulders) - While the cloaks *do* cover shoulders, this isn't the defining characteristic described as a requirement.
*   **C: E mau ana i tētahi takai mai i te ariki** (They are wearing a cloak from the lord) - The passage doesn't specify *who* provides the cloak, just that it's worn.



"
Ko tehea o ngā kakahu e whai ake nei e kore e taea te tono i te whare karakia? ,"The correct answer is **B: Poto** (Shorts).

Here's why, based on the provided text:

* **The passage explicitly states:** Women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and shoulders. Men are required to wear trousers to cover their knees.
* **It also implies:**  Bringing your own head covering (tākai) is acceptable, and often encouraged.
* **The main point relating to clothing restrictions:** The passage emphasizes covering knees and shoulders as a requirement for both genders. Shorts do *not* cover the knees, therefore they would not be allowed.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā Skirts (Skirts):** Skirts are *required* for women.
* **C: Tarautete (Trousers):** Trousers are *required* for men.
* **D: Ngā Tākai (Head coverings):** Head coverings are permitted and sometimes encouraged.



"
I te wā e whai wāhitanga ai tētahi manuhiri ki te mātakitaki whetū i a ia e haere ana ki ngā wāhi Antarctic?,"The correct answer is **D: Ina iti te taumata pokenga mārama**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kāore he tino raruraru o te parakino-raiti, ā, ka manawareka anō hoki koe ki ngā whetū."" This translates to ""...there isn't much light pollution, and you can enjoy the stars even more.""  

Therefore, the best opportunity to see stars while in Antarctica is when light pollution is minimal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I roto i ngā marama raumati (In the summer months)** - The passage specifically recommends going during the *winter* for the polar night and Aurora Borealis viewing.
*   **B: Ki te kore te rohe e noho (If the area is uninhabited)** - While this helps reduce light pollution, it's not the primary condition mentioned for stargazing.
*   **C: I roto i ngā marama hōtoke (In the October months)** - This doesn't align with the passage's emphasis on the darkness of winter.



"
I te wā i kore ai te waea amiorangi e taea te whakakapi i te waea pūkoro?,"The correct answer is **A: Mēnā ka whakararurarutia pea te raina tirohanga ki te aorangi** (If the line of sight to the satellite is obstructed).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...me noho ki waho i te whare me te tirohanga wātea atu ki te āmiorangi kia pato i tētahi waeatanga atu."" (…you must be outside the house and have a clear view of the satellite to get a signal).  This means a satellite phone *can't* work if the view of the satellite is blocked.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mēnā he mamao rawa te tauwāhi** (If the place is too far away) - The passage doesn't mention distance as a primary limitation, just the need for a clear view.
* **C: Mēnā ka whakamahia ki waho** (If used outside) -  Using it outside is *required* for it to work, not a limitation.
* **D: Mēnā e hiahiatia ana e tētahi haerenga ētahi hiahia raraunga** (If a journey requires data needs) -  Satellite phones *can* handle data needs, it's just not as convenient as a cell phone.



"
Āhea ka pai ake ai tētahi waea tawhiorangi ki tētahi waea pūtau?,"The correct answer is **B: I te wā o te haerenga poti** (During a boating trip).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""The service is frequently used by sailors, including yachts, and also those on journeys who require remote data and voice."" This directly links satellite phones to boating/journeys where cell service is unavailable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I a ia e hararei ana i tētahi taone** (When on holiday in a town) - Cell service is generally available in towns.
* **C: Ki te kore e hiahiatia te raraunga mamao** (If remote data is not needed) - If you don't need remote data, a cell phone is sufficient. The passage highlights satellite phones *because* of the need for remote data.
* **D: Ina whai pānuitanga waea pūtau tika koe** (When you have good cell coverage) -  Again, if you have cell coverage, a satellite phone isn't necessary.



"
Na te papā o ēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei i ahu mai ki te hanganga o te Whenua o Transnistria?,"The correct answer is **B: Ethnicity**.

Here's why:

The text states Moldova is a ""multi-ethnic country that has been affected by ethnic conflict."" It then specifically describes the Transnistria Republic arising due to this conflict, implying a separation based on ethnic differences. While other options might be *related*, ethnicity is the direct cause mentioned in the passage for the formation of Transnistria.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Whakahaerenga (Governance/Administration):** While Transnistria *has* its own governance, the text says it *arose from* a conflict, not from establishing a government first.
*   **C: Reo (Language):** Language is mentioned as a factor in Moldova (Romanian & Russian), but not as the *cause* of the Transnistria split.
*   **D: Whakapono (Religion):** Religion (Orthodox Christianity) is mentioned, but doesn't drive the formation of Transnistria according to the text.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ana i te Republic of Transnistria e rerekē ana i te toenga o Moldova?  ,"The correct answer is **D: Moni**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Transnistria Republic has ""tō rātou ake kāwanatanga, pūnaha moni anō hoki"" (their own government and monetary system). This clearly indicates a difference in monetary systems between Transnistria and the rest of Moldova.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Reo** - The passage states both Moldova and Transnistria widely speak Russian and Moldova's official language is Romanian, indicating similarities in language use.
*   **B: Whakapono** - The passage mentions the Orthodox Christian faith as the main religion in Moldova, implying it is likely shared in Transnistria as well.
*   **C: Āhukahuka UN** - The passage specifically states Transnistria is *not* recognized by any UN member, indicating both areas share that lack of UN recognition.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, āhea haere ai ki Montevideo mehemea e tūmanako ana rātau ki te karo i nga āhuatanga hau?","The correct answer is **D: I roto i ngā marama hōtoke o Montevideo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""He māminga pea te makariri o te hōtoke: kāore ngā paemahana i te tino heke iho ki raro i te kore, engari ka pāhekoheko te hau me te mākū kia makariri iho te rongo i tā te ine mahana."" (The cold in October is mild: temperatures don't really drop below zero, but the wind and humidity can make it feel colder). This indicates October (hōtoke) is a time with milder, less extreme weather.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I roto i ngā marama hōtoke o Hemisphere ki te Raki:** While the passage mentions the Northern Hemisphere, it specifically focuses on the conditions *in* Montevideo during October.
* **B: I te wā o te wā maroke o Montevideo:**  The passage explicitly states ""Kāore he wā ua, kāore he wā maroke"" (There is no rainy season, no dry season).
* **C: I roto i ngā marama raumati o Hemisphere ki te Raki:** The passage says summer in Montevideo is hot (+30°C).  Someone wanting to *avoid* extreme weather would not go then.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, āhea te haere ki Montevideo mehemea he wāhi rātau ki tētahi āhuarangi mātao ake?","The correct answer is **A: Ina raumati i Montevideo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""i ngā wā e raumati ana ki reira, e takurua ana ki te Raki, ā huri kau ake hoki."" (when it is summer there, it is winter in the North, and vice-versa.) and ""i ngā marama o te raumati ka eke noa ake i te +30 tākiri C te pāmahana."" (in the summer months the temperature can reach +30 degrees Celsius.)
* The question asks for when to go to Montevideo for *warmer* weather.  Summer in Montevideo is described as being hot (+30°C).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ina raumati i te Hemisphere ki te Raki:** This is the opposite season in Montevideo.
* **C: Ina tae ki te wā marangai o Montevideo:** The passage states there isn't a truly dry season - rain is consistent throughout the year.
* **D: Ina hōtoke i te Hemisphere ki te Raki:**  Hōtoke (October) in the Northern Hemisphere is fall/autumn, and the passage describes October in Montevideo as feeling cold due to wind and humidity, even if the thermometer doesn't drop *below* zero.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tēhea o ēnei e pā ana ki tētahi kaitoi whakairo kua whakatūria, i te mea he mahi whakangaro?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā takahanga Graffiti**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses graffiti:** The passage specifically talks about ""muraiti"" (murals) and ""tuhinga anuanu"" (graffiti) as forms of expression. It highlights how, despite often being associated with youth, it can involve deliberate, skilled work, evolving into more ""legitimate"" art forms.
* **Graffiti as a recognized art form:** The passage states that graffiti can be recognized as ""mahi toi"" (art), not just vandalism.
* **""Mahi whakangaro"" (subversive work)**: The passage describes graffiti's initial form as disruptive (""kikino,"" ""tūkino"") but evolving. This disruptive, often unauthorized, aspect aligns with the concept of ""mahi whakangaro"" or subversive work.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tuhia (Writing):** While graffiti *includes* writing, the passage focuses on the visual aspect – the murals and tags.
* **C: Ngā mura tē hiahiatia i runga i te āhuatanga tūmatanui (Unwanted murals on a large scale):** The passage doesn’t explicitly focus on unwanted or large-scale murals, but the overall practice of graffiti.
* **D: Ngā tūtohu kāore e taea te whakatau (Undecidable suggestions):** This is too vague and doesn’t relate to the specific information in the passage.



"
He aha te āhua o nga hākari pūoro e whakaaro ana ētahi kaiāwhina he wāhi tino nui o te wheako?,"The correct answer is **C: Pūoro e purei tōmuri ana ki te pō** (Music playing late into the night).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...terā ētahi wāhi o te hui ahurei e whakatangi puoro tai nuaku ana kia waenganui pō."" This directly translates to ""...there are some parts of the festival that play music late into the night.""  The passage highlights this as continuing even *after* the main stage performances are over, making it a significant part of the festival experience for many.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te kawe tamariki nohinohi** (Bringing young children) - The passage mentions dedicated spaces *for* families with young children, but doesn't say it's a core part of the experience for *everyone*.
*   **B: Kei te puni i runga i te pae** (Crowding on the floor) - While mentioned, it's described as something fans *do* to get close, not a defining feature of the festival itself.
*   **D: Kei te moata** (Being fashionable/dressing up) - This isn't mentioned at all in the passage.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te tikanga kia manakē te kaiāwhina hākari mehemea e hiahia ana rātau ki te hopuni e tata ana ki te pūoro?","The correct answer is **C: Kei te weto te puni**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Me kei te hiahia koe kia tata atu ki ngā mahi, me tae wawe atu koe kia whai wāhi atu ki tētahi puni tata ki ngā waiata.""  This translates to: ""If you want to be closer to the action, you need to arrive early to participate in a circle close to the music.""  ""Weto"" (circle/puni) is the key word here.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E haere tōmuri ana i te pō (Going out late at night)** - The passage emphasizes *arriving early*, not going out late.
* **B: E noho ana i tētahi wāhi mō ngā whānau (Sitting in a family area)** - The passage mentions family areas, but doesn’t state that's how to get close to the music.
* **D: Kei te moata (Dancing)** - While dancing is likely *at* the event, it's not the action you take to get *closer* to the music.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Me karo ngā manuhiri ina rapu i te oranga pō i te raki o New Mexico?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā pae taone iti** (Small town bars).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""**Kia tūpato: kāore ngā pāpara kauta o ngā tāone iti ki konei i te wāhi pai i ngā wā katoa mō te manuhiri nō waho i te takiwā.**"" This translates to: ""**Be careful: the bars of small towns here are not always a good place for visitors from outside the area.**"" 

The passage specifically warns visitors to be cautious about bars in small towns.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pueblos:** The passage states you *won't* find much nightlife in the Pueblos themselves.
*   **C: Nga toa hokohoko** (Shops): The passage doesn't mention anything about shops being unsafe or to be avoided.
*   **D: Casinos:** The passage mentions casinos *offer* drinks, but doesn’t suggest avoiding them.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, kei hea te wāhi e kitea ai e te manuhiri ngā whakangahau rongonui i te raki o New Mexico?","The correct answer is **C: I tētahi kaihoko e tata ana ki Sante Fe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kei te tō mai ētahi o rātou i te whakangahau ingoa-parani (inarā ko ngā mea rahi e tino tata ana ki Albuquerque me Santa Fe)."" This translates to ""...some of them are offering brand-name entertainment (especially the larger ones closest to Albuquerque and Santa Fe)."" 

This clearly indicates that the more well-known entertainment options are located near Santa Fe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I te kaihoko e rua haora mai i Albuquerque** - The passage doesn't mention entertainment being *two hours* away, just *near* Albuquerque and Santa Fe.
* **B: I tētahi pueblo mamao** - The passage states the opposite – you *won't* find much entertainment in remote Pueblos.
* **D: I tētahi pae taone iti** - The passage cautions against the bars in small towns being good for visitors.



"
Tērā pea e hiahia ana ngā kaimahi mōhio pūtea ki te karo ko tēhea momo inu?,"The correct answer is **A: Waina o Ahitereiria (Australian wine)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He nui ngā waina Wīwī, engari ka whāroa ake pea te totoro atu o ngā waina a Aotearoa me Ahitereiria."" (There are many European wines, but the flavour of New Zealand and Australian wines may be longer lasting/more developed).

This implies that Australian wine is a notable and potentially preferable choice, making it the most likely drink a financially savvy person would consider.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Wai pounamu (Greenstone water)** - This isn't mentioned in the passage and isn't a typical beverage.
* **C: pia paetata (bitter beer)** - The passage describes local beers as ""māma he whakarekareka"" (mild and refreshing), the opposite of bitter.
* **D: Wai Fruit (Fruit water)** - While mentioned as an option if someone is cautious about tap water, it doesn't seem like a drink someone particularly knowledgeable about finances would actively *seek* out.



"
"I runga anō i te wāhi i whakaahuatia i roto i te wāhanga, ko tehea o ngā tono inu e whai ake nei ka raruraru pea e te kaiwhakarato?","The correct answer is **B: He tau Kotahi**.

Here's why:

* **The text specifically states:** ""Ko te pia ā-rohe matua ko te """"Nama tahi"""", ehara i te pia uaua, ēngari he māma he whakarekareka.""  This translates to ""The main local beer is """"Nama tahi"""", it's not a strong beer, but a light and refreshing one.""  Asking for ""He tau Kotahi"" (Nama tahi) is perfectly fine.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to cause trouble:

* **A: He pango poto (Short black):** The text explicitly states ""ko te short black he """"espresso"""".""  The provider understands this.
* **C: He Sauvignon Blanc mai i New Zealand (Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand):** The text mentions New Zealand wines and implies they are available (""...ka whāroa ake pea te totoro atu o ngā waina a Aotearoa..."").
* **D: He mā papatahi (Flat white):** The text states ""Ko te ariā mō te kawhe """"papatahi mā' he manene."" This tells us a flat white is understood and served.



Therefore, asking for ""He tau Kotahi"" is the most likely request the provider would easily fulfill based on the text provided."
E toru rau tau te roa o te wā o te whakawātea e te rōpū nei?,"The correct answer is **D: Nga Paniora** (The Spanish).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I tīmata te iwi Pāniora ki ngā mahi raupatu, **toru rautau te roa.**"" (The Spanish people began the work of dispossession, **for three centuries**.)

Therefore, the Spanish were the group that engaged in dispossession for three centuries.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te huarahi pai rawa atu ki te tiki i tētahi Parihi kia mahana ki a koe?","The correct answer is **A: Attemp ki te hōrite i te āhua o te Parihi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ko te ara pai rawa kia pai te haere ki Parī kia pai rawa tō whanonga, me pērā i tētahi tangata he """"bien eleve"""" (kua pai te whakatipu). Mā korā e māmā ake ai te neke haere."" 

This translates to: ""...the best way to have a good time in Paris and be well-received is to behave like someone who is “bien eleve” (well-bred/well-mannered). That will make things easier."" 

Therefore, attempting to emulate the Parisian style and mannerisms is the best way to be well-received, according to the passage.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kia nui ake te maia** (Be more confident) - While confidence is good, the passage doesn't emphasize boldness.
*   **C: Kia whai whakaaro** (Be thoughtful) - Thoughtfulness is a positive trait, but not specifically mentioned as the key to Parisian acceptance.
*   **D: Whakaatu whanonga kōaro** (Show rude behavior) - The passage implies the opposite - that good manners are important."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i te whakaarotia he kounga tīwharawhara o nga Parisian?","The correct answer is **D: ohorere**.

Here's why:

The passage describes Parisians as ""whakahīhī"" (proud), ""kuare"" (arrogant/refined), and ""whakamenemene"" (snobbish). It also suggests behaving like someone ""bien eleve"" (well-bred) to navigate Paris smoothly. This points to a preference for formality and a dislike of surprises or unexpected behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Whakahīhī (Proud):** The passage explicitly states Parisians are proud.
*   **B: āhuaatua (Refined/Elegant):** ""Kuare"" implies refinement and a certain elegance.
*   **C: Pureitanga (Snobbishness):** ""Whakamenemene"" directly translates to snobbishness.

**Ohorere (Surprise/Unexpectedness)** is *not* mentioned as a characteristic of Parisians, and the advice given implies they *dislike* it. Therefore, it's the quality *not* associated with them in this passage.



"
He aha te painga o te Tauaha Tuatahi i runga i te MetroRail o Cape Town?,"The correct answer is **B: Ehara i te tokomaha o ngā tāngata** (There aren't many people).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He hāneanea, ā, kāore hoki e tino nui te tāngata ki MetroPlus..."" which directly translates to ""It's enjoyable, and there aren't many people on MetroPlus..."".  MetroPlus is the Level One service.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kai mua te kaiako i te tereina** (The teacher gets on the train first) - The passage doesn't mention teachers.
*   **C: He iti iho te utu i te tīkiti Tauaha Tuatoru** (It costs less than a Level Three ticket) - The passage states MetroPlus is *more* expensive than Metro (Level Three).
*   **D: He ōrite te utu hei tīkiti Metro** (It costs the same as a Metro ticket) - The passage states MetroPlus is *more* expensive than Metro.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha ia tereina haere i Cape Town?","The correct answer is **D: Ngā kaiako tauaha Tuatahi, Tuatoru hoki** (Both First Level and Third Level trains).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Katoa ngā tereina, nā MetroPlus (Taumata Tuatahi) me Metro (Taumata Tuatoru)..."" This means *all* trains are either MetroPlus (First Level) or Metro (Third Level) and both go to Cape Town.
* The passage also specifically states ""Ko ngā tereina MetroPlus kei te pito o te tereina e tata ana ki Cape Town."" (MetroPlus trains are at the end of the train near Cape Town.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He kaiako Metro iti iho** (A smaller Metro teacher) - This doesn't make sense in the context of the passage.
* **B: Te utu tīkiti ōrite mō ngā akoranga e rua** (The ticket price is the same for both lessons) - The passage says MetroPlus is *more* expensive, not the same price.
* **C: E toru nga karaehe rerekē** (Three different carriages) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the number of carriages.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he tūkino kararehe e kore pea e mahi?,"The correct answer is **B: Whakapouri i nga mate** (Spreading disease).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ko ngā riha te whakapirau kai, te whakaputa hīrawerawe, ā, ko te mea kino rawa ka whakaputa mate tāwera, te whakawhānui paitini, te tuku poke rānei.""  This translates to ""The pests can contaminate food, produce allergens, and worst of all, spread disease, amplify bacteria, or release toxins.""  It *specifically* mentions spreading disease as a negative consequence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Taketia he rua** (Taking two) - This doesn't relate to pest harm described in the passage.
* **C: horahia he mate** (Contract a disease) - The pests *spread* disease, they don't contract it themselves in this context.
* **D: He mate tōpana** (A venomous bite) - The passage *does* mention bites (""te tōpana"") as a way diseases can be transmitted, but doesn't say it's something pests *won't* do. It's a described effect, not an unlikely action.



Therefore, **B** is the only option representing a harm that the passage specifically identifies pests as being capable of causing."
Ki hea hokona ai ngā kāri waea utu-tōmua?,"The correct answer is **C: I ngā toa kokonga** (In convenience stores).

Here's why:

The passage states ""Kua whakakīia ia toa-koki ki te huhua o kāri wāea hoko kua utua kētia e rangirua ai koe..."" which translates to ""Each convenience store is stocked with pre-paid phone cards that you can purchase..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I ngā whenua tauwhāiti** (In supermarkets) - The passage doesn't mention supermarkets.
* **B: I ngā pou tereina** (At train stations) - The passage doesn't mention train stations.
* **D: I ngā waea utu** (At prepaid phones) -  This doesn't make sense - you buy *cards* *for* prepaid phones, not *at* them.



"
He pēhea te āheitanga o ngā mokatere waea pai ake i tukuna e ētahi kāri?,"The correct answer is **B: Mā ngā tau wātea-utu** (Through free periods).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ko te urunga ki ēnei ratonga, i te nuinga o te wā, kei roto i te nama waea kore-utu ka taea te waea atu i tētahi waea kore-utu."" This translates to ""Access to these services is often included in a free phone plan that can be called from a toll-free number.""  This directly indicates the better rates are available *through free periods* or included allowances.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka taea anake te uru atu ki ngā whenua tauwhāiti (Can only be accessed internationally):** The passage mentions the cards work with both landlines and mobile phones, not specifically international calls.
* **C: Kei te pātaka kokonga (At the bank):** The passage doesn't relate the cards to banks.
* **D: Mā te whakamahi waea utu me te utu i tētahi utu tāpiri (By using a toll call and paying an additional fee):** The passage implies the *benefit* of the cards is *avoiding* extra fees for certain calls.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā rākau e whai ake nei he iti iho te pūnoa i roto i te pāka ā iwi o Plitvice Lakes?","The correct answer is **A: Ōkahu (Beech)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He nui te ngahere ki te Plitvice Lakes national park, ko te nuinga he rākau beech, he spruce, he fir...""  (""There is a large forest in the Plitvice Lakes national park, mostly beech, spruce, and fir trees..."")

While beech *is* present, the phrasing ""ko te nuinga"" (mostly) implies that beech is less dominant than spruce and fir. The passage doesn't mention the abundance of oak (Ōkahu), fir (oki), or spruce. Therefore, oak is the least mentioned/implied to be present in abundance.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā ao kararehe āhua kore e whai ake nei e kitea ana i roto i te pāka ā iwi o Plitvice Lakes?,"The correct answer is **C: Cassowary**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically mentions ""capercaillie""** as being found in the Plitvice Lakes National Park. ( ""...capercaillie ka kitea ki reira..."")
* **The passage lists several other animals** like the European brown bear, lynx, otter, wolf, deer, and chamois.
* **Turkey** is a plausible animal to find in a forested area, though not explicitly mentioned.
* **Honey Badger** is not mentioned and is native to Africa and Asia, making it unlikely to be found in Croatia.
* **Cassowaries** are native to Australia and New Guinea and would *not* be found in a European national park like Plitvice Lakes.

Therefore, the only animal definitively *not* found in the park based on general knowledge and the provided text is the Cassowary.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha tonu ngā waehere rohe e āwhina ana?","The correct answer is **D: tārua kore mana** (double standards).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the companies are using the excuse of """"aukati tārua koremana"""" (double standards) to justify their actions. The passage criticizes this as a weak argument, saying local interests don't really care about copyright issues – it's about giving these companies more market power and making money.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tārua kōpae (copying)** - While copyright is related to copying, the passage doesn't say local policies *help* with copying. It says they *don't care* about it.
*   **B: Mana mākete (market power)** - The passage says the *companies* want more market power, not that local policies help them achieve it.
*   **C: Āraitanga Piracy (piracy protection)** - The passage implies the opposite – that local policies don't focus on protecting against piracy.



Therefore, **tārua kore mana** is the direct answer to the question, as it's the alleged reason given (and criticised) in the passage."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he teka mō ngā waehere rohe e mau tonu ana e ngā kamupene pāpāho?","The correct answer is **A: E hiahiatia ana kia whiwhi mana mākete anō (They are seeking to gain more market power)**.

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

* **""Ko te tino take ko te tuku i te mana whakahaere nui ake ki aua kamupene mō ā rātou mākete""** - This directly translates to ""The main reason is to give more control to those companies over their markets.""  This clearly indicates the companies want more market power.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ka āwhina rātau ki te karo i te tāruatanga ture kore mana (They help them avoid untraceable counterfeiting)** - The text states local efforts against counterfeiting are ""not much"" and that current measures are insufficient, but doesn't say the broadcasting companies *help* avoid it.
* **C: He whai painga rātau mo te takahuri moni (They benefit from money laundering)** - The text focuses on market power and profit (""hanga pūtea""), not specifically money laundering.
* **D: Āhua kore nei rātau e āwhina ki te ārai i te tāpaetanga (They don't seem to help prevent competition)** - The text implies the opposite - they are *increasing* their control to reduce competition (by gaining market power).

"Ina tae ki tō kāinga tupu, ko tēhea tukanga he ōpaki noa iho?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā taki manene (Customs declarations)**.

Here's why:

* **The P (Prompt) discusses situations where customs declarations are not easily seen, potentially involving undeclared items, and the frustration of border control.** It highlights the need to know what *is* and *isn't* allowed, and to declare items exceeding legal limits.
* **The Q (Question) asks about a routine process upon arriving at your home country.**

Customs declarations (Ngā taki manene) are *the* routine process you complete when arriving back in your country, declaring any goods you are bringing with you.  This directly relates to the issues raised in the prompt about knowing what to declare and adhering to regulations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kei te kōrero i ngā tūemi (Talking about shipments):**  This is too broad.  While customs deals with shipments, it's not the *process* of arrival.
* **C: Ngā tepe ture o ngā tūemi (Legal rules of shipments):** This refers to the rules themselves, not the *act* of declaring goods.
* **D: Mana ritenga (Customs regulations/authority):**  This refers to the authority *doing* the checking, not the process *you* complete.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei me mōhio koe i mua i to taenga atu ki tō kāinga tupu?,"The correct answer is **D: Mēnā kāore e whakaaetia ngā tūemi e kawea mai ana e koe** (If the items you are bringing are not allowed).

Here's why, based on the original text (P):

The text states: ""Me mōhio koe ki ngā mea e whakaaetia ana te kawe mai, kāore rānei i te whakaaetia"" (You need to know what is allowed to be brought, or not allowed).  This directly relates to knowing *before* arriving what items are prohibited.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **A: Mēnā he wāhitaki nekeneke** (If there is a customs checkpoint) - While customs checkpoints are relevant, the passage focuses on *knowing the rules* rather than just the existence of a checkpoint.
* **B: Mēnā e hiahia ana koe ki te whakapuaki tūemi i runga i ngā tepe ā-ture** (If you want to declare items on the legal forms) -  Declaring is a *result* of knowing what's allowed, not the primary information you need beforehand.
* **C: Mēnā he Mana Ritenga** (If there is a Customs Authority) - Similar to A, this is about *who* enforces the rules, not *what* the rules are.



Therefore, understanding what you *cannot* bring is the most important thing to know *before* arriving at your boarding school (kāinga tupu), as highlighted in the original passage."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he nui tonu ngā mea e āhei ai ngā kaipiki ki te kite i ngā ararere hōu i roto i te Awaawa o Cochamó?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā tirohanga (The views)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kei roto i te piki ki ngā tihi ko ngā tirohanga mīharo i ngā tihi."" This translates to ""Within the climb to the peaks are magnificent views of the peaks.""  It then continues to say climbers are constantly establishing new routes ""to its endless walls"" *to see* these views.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Huihuinga (Meetings)** - The passage doesn't mention any meetings.
* **C: Tihi (Peaks)** - While climbers *reach* the peaks, the passage says they climb *to see* the views *of* the peaks. The views are the new thing they seek.
* **D: Ngā pātū (The walls)** - The walls are where the climbing *happens*, but not what the climbers are looking to *see* that’s new.



"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i homai i roto i te wāhanga, ko wai e hipoki ana i te nuinga o ngā whakawhiti i te Hau-ā-uru?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Star Alliance te katoa atu i te taha Rāwhiti o te Tonga o te Moana a Kiwa mai i Santiago de Chile ki Tahiti"". This means Star Alliance covers all flights on the eastern side of the South Pacific, from Chile to Tahiti.  Since the question asks about who controls *most* of the transfers in the South Pacific, and Star Alliance has comprehensive coverage of a significant portion (the eastern side), it's the most logical answer.

The passage specifically notes SkyTeam *doesn't* cover all three of the South Pacific transfers. LATAM Oneworld operates *a* flight, not the most transfers. ""South Pacific"" isn't a company or alliance.



"
Ko tēhea hononga rererangi e whakaiti ana i te iti rawa o ngā whakawhiti moana i te hauwhā ki te Tonga?,"The correct answer is **A: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Star Alliance te katoa atu i te taha Rāwhiti o te Tonga o te Moana a Kiwa mai i Santiago de Chile ki Tahiti, te rerenga LATAM Oneworld."" This means Star Alliance covers the eastern South Pacific with the fewest connections.  The passage also notes that no alliance fully covers all three oceanic regions of the Southern Hemisphere and that Star Alliance has the most coverage in the east.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: South Pacific** - This isn't a major airline alliance mentioned in the text.
* **C: LATAM Oneworld** - While LATAM Oneworld *operates* a key route, it's *covered* by Star Alliance, not an alliance itself minimizing connections.
* **D: SkyTeam** - The text explicitly states SkyTeam doesn't cover one of the oceanic regions.



"
Ko tēhea whakahaere haereere i tutuki ai ngā Haerenga Whakahaere Huri noa?,"The correct answer is **B: Haere ki nga haerenga oma** (Running Tours).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ko te piki tūranga o The Global Running tours ka torotoro ki te huhua o ngā kaiomaoma i ngā whenua rahi e whā."" (The rise of The Global Running tours explores the quality of runners in the four major countries).  It then *lists* Running Tours Barcelona, Running Tours Copenhagen, and Running Tours Prague *as examples* of tours within The Global Running Tours organization.
* **""Haere ki nga haerenga oma""** directly translates to ""Running Tours"" which is the overarching organization discussed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Whakahaere ana i Koupākihi** - This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **C: Whakahaere ana i ngā Haerenga Prague** - This refers to *one specific tour* within The Global Running Tours, not the organization itself.
* **D: Whakahaere ana i ngā Haereere Barcelona** - This also refers to *one specific tour* within the organization.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ka awhina a Go Running Tours ki te hono atu e hia nga momo whakahaere tirotiro?","The correct answer is **B: 200**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I te ao, he tata ki t 200 ngā rōpū whakahaere omanga roa."" This translates to ""In the world, there are approximately 200 long-distance running management groups."" 

The question asks how many *types* of management organizations Go Running Tours helps connect. The passage directly states there are *around 200* of these groups.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Whā (Four)** - The passage mentions four *cities* (Barcelona, Copenhagen, Prague, and ""others"") where Running Tours operates, not four types of management organizations.
*   **C: Tatini (Many)** - While ""many"" is true, the passage gives a specific number (""approximately 200"").
*   **D: Toru (Three)** - The passage explicitly lists more than three cities/organizations.



"
He aha te mahi a te manuhiri ki te mea e tumanako ana ia kia tino kitea te cheetah?,"The correct answer is **D: Tangohia he motokā me te whakamahi i ngā taputapu paerewa** (Take a car and use standard equipment).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ētahi kararehe pēnei i ngā arewhana me ngā Hirāwhe ka whakatata atu i ētahi wā ki ngā motokā, ā, mā te taputapu ngāwari noa e whai wāhi atu ai ki te tirohanga papai."" (Some animals like gazelles and cheetahs sometimes approach the cars, and standard equipment allows for better viewing.)

This directly links cheetah sightings to being in a vehicle with standard viewing equipment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Haere ki runga i te safari hiki** (Go on a driving safari) - While general safaris *can* lead to cheetah sightings, the passage specifically highlights the benefit of cars for *better* viewing of cheetahs.
*   **B: Haere ki runga i te hīkoi ngahere** (Go on a bushwalk) - The passage discusses walking safaris as a different experience, not specifically for cheetah viewing.
*   **C: Whakamahia ngā karu** (Use binoculars) - While binoculars are helpful, the passage says standard equipment *with the car* aids in viewing.



"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, ko tēhea momo kararehe tērā pea ka tūtaki i te wā o te whakawhānuitanga i roto i te waka?","The correct answer is **B: Giraffes**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ētahi kararehe pēnei i ngā arewhana me ngā Hirāwhe ka whakatata atu i ētahi wā ki ngā motokā..."" (Some animals like elephants and **giraffes** sometimes approach the cars...). 

The passage specifically mentions giraffes as animals that get close to the vehicles during safaris. While lions, cheetahs and leopards are *mentioned* as potentially seen, the passage doesn't say they commonly approach the vehicles.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te utu o te haereere?","The correct answer is **A: E haere ana i a koe anō (Traveling alone)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He iti ake ngā haerenga mō ngā rōpu nui nei, nā reira mēnā e haere takitahi ana, takirua ana rānei, me whakahoahoa haere kia iti iho te utu ki ia tangata.""  This translates to: ""Trips are cheaper for larger groups, therefore if you are traveling alone or in pairs, you should pool together to reduce the cost per person.""

This implies that traveling *alone* is generally more expensive, and the passage is advising people to join groups to *lower* the cost.  Therefore, the passage is *about* the cost of traveling alone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kimi ana i tētahi rōpū e whā (Looking for a group of four)** - The passage suggests joining a group, but doesn't specify a group *of four*.
* **C: Haere ana me tētahi atu tangata (Traveling with another person)** - While mentioned as an option to *avoid* higher costs, it isn't the core point about cost.
* **D: Kimi ana i tētahi rōpū e ono neke atu rānei (Looking for a group of six or more)** - The passage doesn't specify a minimum group size, just that larger groups get cheaper rates.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko wai pea ka haumaru i te mokatere whakaterenga tino pai?","The correct answer is **C: Tokorua nga hoa e haere tahi ana** (Two friends travelling together).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""He iti ake ngā haerenga mō ngā rōpu nui nei, nā reira mēnā e haere takitahi ana, takirua ana rānei, me whakahoahoa haere kia iti iho te utu ki ia tangata."" (Travel is cheaper for large groups, therefore if travelling alone or in pairs, you should share rides to lower the cost per person.)
* This directly implies that travelling *as a pair* is a good way to get a better fare.
* The passage also warns that prices can be manipulated to *seem* higher, but sharing a ride is a genuine way to reduce costs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ko nga tūruhi e hiahia ana ki te riwhi motokā (The drivers wanting to fill cars):** The passage suggests drivers might *increase* prices deceptively, not offer the best fares.
* **B: He rōpū tokotoru (A group of three):** While groups benefit, the passage specifically highlights the advantage for *pairs* when compared to solo travel.
* **D: He rōpū tokorima (A group of five):** This is a larger group, and the passage indicates larger groups already get cheaper fares – the specific advice is for solo or paired travellers.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te āwhina ki te āhukahuka puta noa i te ao o San Francisco?","The correct answer is **A: He arotahi auau i roto i ngā momo toi me te pāpāho** (A focus on various forms of art and media).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te tōaitanga o ngā puoro, ngā kiriata, ngā tuhinga me ngā ahurea rongonui i āwhina ai i te tāone me ana wāhi papai kia hau te rongo i te ao."" (The influence of music, film, literature and famous cultures has helped the city and its precious places gain global recognition.)

This directly indicates that San Francisco's strong focus on arts and media is what contributes to its international reputation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ngā pūkenga o te hui kāniwha o runga** (The skills of the senior management team) - The passage doesn't mention this.
*   **C: Te rerenga kētanga o te ohaoha** (The uniqueness of the economy) - While the economy is diverse, the passage specifically highlights *how* it gained recognition (through arts & culture).
*   **D: He tirohanga kai Āhia e tū mai nei** (A prominent Asian cuisine scene) -  While the passage *mentions* the excellent Asian cuisine, it doesn't state this is what makes San Francisco famous internationally. It's a benefit *within* the city, not the reason for global recognition.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki San Francisco ehara i te tika?","The correct answer is **D: Kei te whakawhirinaki katoa te ohanga ki te tuuruhi** (The economy completely relies on tourism).

Here's why:

The passage states that tourism *is* a significant part of San Francisco's economy, contributing to its global reputation and development of high-quality infrastructure. However, it *also* lists other major industries: professional services, government, finance, commerce, and technology. 

Therefore, the statement that the economy *completely* relies on tourism is **not** accurate according to the passage.

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct:

* **A: He rite tonu te whakaaturanga i roto i ngā whitiāhua me ngā pukapuka** (The representation in images and books is consistent) - The passage mentions the city's cultural influence and fame, suggesting it is well-represented.
* **B: He nui te kai Ahia** (There is a lot of Asian food) - The passage explicitly states San Francisco is one of the best places in the country for Asian cuisine (Korean, Thai, Indian, Japanese, etc.).
* **C: He maha ngā hōtēra me ngā pokapū hui** (There are many hotels and convention centers) - The passage highlights the development of a large tourism infrastructure, including hotels and convention centers.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea momo haere kāore pea e whai hua ki te whakamahi i ngā ratonga a te māngai haere?","The correct answer is **D: He tangata haere e pai ana ki te tono mo nga putea.**

Here's why:

The passage states travel agents can hold reservations *for you* while you consider booking, or getting other documents (like travel insurance). Someone who *likes* to shop around for deals (tino pai ki te tono mo nga putea - good at asking for prices/deals) likely prefers to handle those arrangements themselves and wouldn't benefit from a travel agent holding things for them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He haere whakarihariha (Spontaneous travel):** Even with spontaneous travel, someone might want a travel agent to quickly book flights and accommodation.
* **B: He tangata haere noa (Regular traveller):** Regular travellers might *still* use a travel agent for convenience, complex itineraries, or access to deals.
* **C: He tangata haere kāore anō kia whiwhi i tana visa (Traveller who hasn't received their visa yet):** A travel agent can assist with visa applications and hold arrangements until the visa is approved.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e kore e whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga hei painga o te tono mā tētahi kaihoko haerenga?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngā mōkī tārewa-katoa (All-inclusive meals)**.

Here's why:

The passage details the following benefits of using a travel agent:

*   **Arranging accommodation:** (hotels, potentially other types like cabins)
*   **Travel packages:** (including flights, transfers, hotel)
*   **Assistance with logistics:** (airport transfers, baggage handling)
*   **Holding reservations:** (allowing time to decide)
*   **Providing information:** (like guidebooks)

It *doesn't* mention all-inclusive meals as a standard benefit. While a travel agent *could* arrange a package that includes meals, it’s not explicitly stated as something they routinely provide.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā tuhinga haere kua manakohia (Confirmed travel documents):** The passage mentions travel agents provide ""kete"" (packages) with travel arrangements, implying documents.
*   **B: Ngā mahi hōtēra (Hotel arrangements):**  This is directly stated – travel agents make hotel arrangements.
*   **D: Kei te pupuri i tētahi tūtohutanga (Holding a reservation):**  The passage explicitly states they ""pupuri i te whakaritenga māu"" (hold the reservation for you).



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha ngā taupānga kaiwhakamāori kupu wā tūturu kāore e taea?","The correct answer is **D: E whakamāori ana tika 100% o te wā** (It translates accurately 100% of the time).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...ēngari me āta titiro, kei hē pea hoki."" which translates to ""...but one must be careful, as it may be incorrect."" This directly indicates that machine translation isn't always accurate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E whakamāori ana tohu i roto i ngā reo kē** (It translates symbols in other languages) - The passage *mentions* the ability to translate text to symbols, so this is something it *can* do.
* **B: E whakamāori ana wāhanga kuputuhi katoa** (It translates entire phrases) - The passage states it can translate ""rerenga kupu katoa"" (entire sentences/phrases), so this is something it *can* do.
* **C: E whakamāori ana kupu kei ngā ahanoa mā te waea atamai** (It translates words in contexts through a smartphone) - The passage mentions this capability as well.



"
He aha ngā whakawhitinga ka taea te mahi tuimotu?,"The correct answer is **C: Tikiake raraunga reo** (Language data acquisition).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...e whakaritea ana te whakawhitinga reo tuimotu ā muri i te **tikiake i te raraunga o te reo e hiahiatia ana**.""  This directly translates to ""...the automated language translation is configured *after* acquiring the necessary language data.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā pūkaha takatau pai ake** (Better computer programs) - While better programs *use* the data, they aren't the process of making the translation automated.
* **B: Ngā waea atamai** (Smartphones) - Smartphones are a *tool* used to access these translations, not the process of automating them.
* **D: Ngā taupānga i te kāwai takatau wā tūturu** (Applications in the artificial intelligence network) - This is too broad.  The specific step mentioned is the data acquisition.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e kore e taea te whakaoho i avalanches?,"The correct answer is **B: tangata**.

Here's why, based on the provided text (translated):

""Snow formations are not different; only frames can hold some snow, and wind drifts can become snow formations. The problem is the adhesion of the snow, therefore it needs to be ripe to fall, and the falling snow may work to ripen the rest. Sometimes the trigger for these trigonometric functions is the sun warming the snow, sometimes other snow, sometimes other traditional skills, sometimes people.""

The text *lists* people as a potential trigger for avalanches (""sometimes people"").  It doesn't say people *can't* trigger them, it says they *can*. The question asks which *cannot* trigger them.

Let's look at why the other options *can*:

* **A: Huka hāpiri (Snow drifts):** Wind drifts *become* snow formations that are susceptible to avalanches, as stated in the text.
* **C: Te ra (The sun):** The sun warming the snow is *specifically* mentioned as a trigger.
* **D: He hukarere tāpiri (Additional snow):** ""Sometimes other snow"" is listed as a trigger.



Therefore, **tangata (people)** is the only option that isn't presented as a potential avalanche trigger in the passage."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e heke iho ana hei horonga?","The correct answer is **A: Ko te hukarere piri kāore i te whakaoho (The stuck mist that isn't activated)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ko te hukapapa e heke ana pea te mahi turupana mō te toenga"" which translates to ""...the descending mist might do the work of condensing the rest.""  It also explains that mist needs something to condense *onto* (dust, seeds, etc.).  The passage refers to ""hukarere piri"" (stuck mist) needing encouragement to descend. This implies that this mist is what *becomes* the condensation/horonga.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngā rākau pakū, kahore he hukarere (Dry trees, without mist)** - The passage doesn't talk about trees becoming condensation.
* **C: He rōrahi hukarere e hiahiatia ana i runga i ngā pānaki poupou (A mist stream needed on high surfaces)** - While the passage mentions wind carrying mist, it doesn't say this *becomes* the condensation itself.
* **D: Ko te hukarere i mahue i te tangata (Mist forgotten by people)** - This is irrelevant to the process described in the text.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko te kare i takea mai i ēhea mea whakarato?","The correct answer is **B: Otaota me nga mea kakara** (Vegetables and spices).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te kai kari tētahi kai kua whakaritea ki ngā **otaota**, ki ngā **rau kikini**, tahi ki te mīti, te huawhenua rānei.""  This directly translates to ""Curry is a dish prepared with **vegetables**, with **spices**, sometimes with meat or vegetables.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yogurt me te wai** (Yogurt and water) - While yogurt (miraka tepe) *is* used in some curries, it's not the base ingredient.
*   **C: miraka koni me te mīti** (Coconut milk and meat) - Coconut milk is used in some regions, and meat is sometimes included, but again, not the fundamental base.
*   **D: manga me te miraka** (Mango and milk) - These aren't mentioned as core ingredients.



"
"I ētahi rohe, i ētahi wā ka whakamahia te waiu kōkō hei whakakapi i te aha o te mea i roto i te kari?","The correct answer is **C: Yogurt**.

Here's why:

The passage states that in northern India and Pakistan, *milk products* (specifically, clarified butter/ghee) are widely used in curries.  Yogurt is a milk product. While not explicitly stated as a *replacement*, it's the closest logical answer considering the context of milk products being common in those regions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mīti (Meat):** The passage mentions meat *as an ingredient* in curry, not something it’s replaced with.
*   **B: Ngā Ka taea te mahi (Vegetables):** Vegetables are also ingredients *in* curry.
*   **D: nga mea kakara (Spices):** Spices are essential to curry, but not something replaced by another ingredient.



"
He aha i tika ai te huri huri noa i ngā Maunga Transantarctic kia eke ai ki te papa?,"The correct answer is **B: He mōrearea te hukarere kiato** (The ice shelf is treacherous).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kāore ēnei i te tino kakama nō reira me roa te kōtiutiu o te ara ki ngā Transantarctic Mountains kia eke ki te mānia."" This translates to ""These are not very safe, therefore the route must be long to the Transantarctic Mountains to reach the plateau."" This implies the direct route (the ice shelf) is *unsafe* or *treacherous*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I te nuinga o te wā ka katia teihana McMurdo** (McMurdo Station is often closed) - The passage doesn't mention the station being closed as a reason for the route.
* **C: Kaore nga tarakihana motuhake i te nimble** (Specialized vehicles are not nimble) - While the passage mentions specialized vehicles are needed, it doesn't say they are clumsy or unable to navigate the ice shelf.
* **D: He ngāwari kē atu i te haere mā te Moana Ross** (It is easier than travelling via the Ross Sea) - The passage implies the opposite; it’s a *longer* and therefore likely *more difficult* route, not an easier one.



"
"I te taha o te South Pole Traverse, he aha te mea kua tohua ki nga haki?","The correct answer is **C: Kua kōpikotia ngā Crevasses ki te hukarere** (The crevasses have been marked with flags).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kua tohua ki te haki ngā āpiti.""  ""Āpiti"" translates to crevasses.  Therefore, the crevasses along the route are marked with flags.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te huarahi i te Teihana o McMurdo** (The route from McMurdo Station) - While the route *starts* at McMurdo, the passage doesn't say the route itself is flagged.
*   **B: tarakihana e mau ana i te hinu** (vehicles carrying fuel) - The passage mentions fuel support, but doesn't say the vehicles are flagged.
*   **D: Ngā swerves mōrearea huri noa i nga maunga** (The winding turns around the mountains) - The passage talks about the route being long and reaching the mountains, but doesn't mention flagging the turns.



"
He aha te mea e kore e whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga hei mea e tika ana kia mōhio nga turuhi ina tūhura i te Tonga o Awherika?,"The correct answer is **A: He rerekē ngā whakaritenga o nga Iwi rerekē mō ngā Visa** (Different tribes have different Visa requirements).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Kia mōhio hoki i te wā e whakamāhere ana he ahakoa he mauritau te Tonga o Awherika ehara i te mea he pēnei ngā whenua tata katoa. Ka rerekē ngā hiahia pane uruwhenua me ngā utu mai i tētahi whenua ki tētahi atu, ā, ka pāngia koe e ai ki tō whenua tipu."" This directly translates to needing to be aware that South Africa is diverse and neighboring countries have different entry requirements and costs based on your nationality. This relates to visa needs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ko te tirotiro i te motokā he huarahi pai ki te haere ki ngā wāhi i waho i te ara i whiua** (Driving a car is a good way to get to places off the beaten track) – This *is* mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Tata tonu ki ngā whenua katoa e noho tata ana ki Awherika ki te Tonga e mau ana** (Almost all countries near South Africa have) - The passage doesn’t state that *all* neighboring countries have… it stresses their *difference*.
* **D: Ka taunakitia he 4x4 mēnā ka haere mā te motokā** (A 4x4 is recommended if travelling by car) – This *is* also explicitly mentioned in the passage.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te tohutohu kino mo nga tūruhi e kimi ana ki te hōpara i Awherika ki te Tonga ma te motokā?","The correct answer is **A: E hiahiatia ana pea ētahi tūemi ohorere i roto i te motokā e te ture**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kei ia motu hoki he ture ahurei e here ana i ngā rawa ohotata me noho ki roto i te waka."" This translates to ""Each country also has unique rules regarding what items are allowed to be carried in the vehicle."" This directly implies that tourists may need to have certain unexpected items in their car to comply with the law.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage *recommends* a 4x4 and says many places *require* one, it doesn't say you can access most places with a regular car.
* **C:** The passage promotes going *off* the beaten track, not sticking to normal routes.
* **D:** The passage states that South Africa's neighboring countries are *not* all the same, but it doesn't say they are bad to visit. It focuses on differing entry requirements and costs.

Ko tēhea o ēnei e kore e whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga hei mōrearea mōrearea o te waiho i ō putea e kore e tirohia?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka taea rātau te pōraru ki tētahi atu tangata (They might be stolen by another person)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the legal consequences of unknowingly transporting drugs, specifically the severe penalties in some countries (long prison sentences, even death). It highlights being used as a drug mule *without knowing*. 

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

*   **A: Tērā pea ka tāhaetia rātau (They might be searched):** The passage explicitly states ""e taea ana te whakamahi i ngā kurī rapu tarukino i te wā e hiahiatia ana"" - drug dogs can be used.
*   **B: Ka taea e koe te mōhio hei kaikawe rongoā (You could unknowingly be a drug carrier):** This is the central warning of the entire passage.
*   **D: Tērā pea ka tirohia rātau e ngā mana hei tuma pōma tūpono (They might be viewed by authorities as a drug threat):** The passage mentions authorities being watchful for drug couriers (""tirohanga o ngā mana e mataara ana ki ngā whakatuma pōmu"").

The passage *doesn't* mention the possibility of your belongings being simply stolen. The risk outlined is the severe legal repercussions of *unwittingly* carrying drugs, not theft.



"
He aha te mea kāore i whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga e pā ana ki te kawe tarukino?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka taea te whakamahi i ngā kurī rongoā me te kore pānui.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Kei roto i tēnei me tatari ki te rārangi, e taea ana te whakamahi i ngā kurī rapu tarukino i te wā e hiahiatia ana horekau te whaki atu i mua.""  This translates to ""In this, you must wait in line, drug-sniffing dogs can be used when needed without prior notification.""  Therefore, the use of drug dogs *is* described.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned in the passage:

* **A: I ētahi whenua, ka taea te whakawakia ki te mate te hunga ka hara tuatahi:** The passage states ""...te mate rānei"" (or even death) as a potential punishment for first-time offenders in some countries.
* **B: Me whai whakaaro anō i te wā e haere ana ki te ao whānui:** The entire passage is a warning to be careful when traveling internationally (""inarā e whakawhiti ana koe i ngā pae o whenua kē"" - as you cross the borders of foreign lands).
* **D: Tērā pea ka tangohia e ngā mana tō putea, ahakoa kāore koe i te mau tarukino:** The passage states ""Tērā pea ka tō mai hoki pea te tirohanga o ngā mana e mataara ana ki ngā whakatuma pōmu"" (Authorities observing for narcotics may also take your funds, even if you are not carrying drugs).



"
He aha te momo inu e kore e whakahuatia hei mea hei whakamātau i te hanga i te kāinga i te wā o te hararei?,"The correct answer is **A: Te waiu (Wine)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions enjoying:

*   **Kawhe mōmona** (rich coffee) in the morning
*   **Tī kamomira whakatā** (calming chamomile tea) at night
*   Suggests experimenting with **tī** (tea) or **peere** (beer) if you enjoy those.

Wine (waiu) is *not* mentioned as something to try making at home during your leisure time. The passage focuses on comforting, easily made beverages for relaxation.



"
"Ko tēhea o ngā mea e whai ake nei me toro atu koe i a koe e noho hararei ana, mēnā e mōhiotia ana tō taone mō tōna ahurea inu?","The correct answer is **C: Pubs kāore koe i te auau noa iho** (Pubs you don't usually frequent).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kite noho koe i tētahi tāone he ahurea inuinu, me haere ki ngā pāpara kāuta ki ngā pāpara rānei kei ngā whare tata ehara i te wāhi haerenga māu.""  This translates to: ""If you live in a town known for its drinking culture, go to bars or pubs you don't normally visit.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā toa kawhe i waho o tō hoa noho** (Coffee shops outside your neighborhood) - While the passage mentions coffee, it doesn't specifically suggest exploring *new* coffee shops as part of a holiday experience.
* **B: Ngā toa Juice, māeneene rānei** (Juice or smoothie shops) - These aren't mentioned in the passage at all.
* **D: Ngā toenga e ahu mai ana i te tī maero** (Remains from black tea) - This is irrelevant to the question.



"
Kai hea nga whakairo Dove?,"The correct answer is **D: I roto i te whare karakia** (Inside the church).

The passage states: ""I roto i te whare karakia, he whakapakoko kukupa māpere nei kei runga i ētahi urupā."" which translates to ""In the church, there are dove sculptures on some pillars.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kotahi hāwhe haora mai i te Kāinga** (Half an hour from the village) - This refers to the travel time *to* the village, not where the sculptures are.
*   **B: I te whare karakia** (In the church) - While close, it's not specific enough. The sculptures aren't just *in* the church, they are *on the pillars inside the church*.
*   **C: I te motu o Eysturoy** (On the island of Eysturoy) - The village *views* the island, but the sculptures aren't *on* the island.



"
He aha te momo visa e hiahiatia ai e te tangata te whakaatu i te taunakitanga o te tautoko moni e tika ana?,"The correct answer is **D: Visa ākonga**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Mō te nuinga o ngā iwi, me whai reta whakaaetanga mai i te kuratini e hiahiatia ana, **me ngā kōrero tautoko ā-pūtea e taunaki ana i a koe anō mō te tau tuatahi o tō tohu**.""  This directly links financial support documentation to the student visa process (""tau tuatahi o tō tohu"" - the first year of your qualification/degree).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Visa pakihi:** The passage contrasts business visas with student visas, implying different requirements.
*   **B: Visa tūruhi:** The passage also contrasts tourist visas with student visas, and states they have different processes.
*   **C: Visa rangitahi:** This type of visa isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
Ko wai e tino hiahiatia ana he visa whānui?,"The correct answer is **C: He Ākonga ao whānui** (A full-time student).

Here's why, based on the provided text:

The passage states: ""ko te haere ki reira hei ākonga ā-ao ka hiahia i te nuinga o te wā ki tētahi noho roa ake i te haere ki reira hei tūruhi poka noa."" (going there as a full-time student will usually require a longer stay than going there as a brief tourist).  It also details the requirements for student visas – acceptance letters and financial support – indicating that a student visa (and therefore a full-time student) is the one needing a more substantial visa.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He tūruhi auau** (A casual tourist) - The passage contrasts a student stay with a *brief* tourist visit, implying tourists don't usually need extensive visas.
*   **B: He haere tau** (Yearly travel) - This is too vague; the passage discusses specific visa types.
*   **D: He Haere Pakihi** (Business Travel) - The passage explicitly states student visa requirements are *different* from business visa requirements.



"
Āhea koe e tino māharahara ai ki nga waeroa?,"The correct answer is **A: I roto i ngā marama raumati (In the summer months)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) specifically states: ""Inarā i te raumati, me mataara koe ki ngā naenae..."" (In summer, you need to be careful of sandflies...).  The entire passage is *about* being wary of sandflies *during the summer*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I runga i nga hīkoi (On hikes):** While the passage *mentions* hiking in the bush, it doesn't say you're *most* worried about sandflies *on* hikes, but rather during summer generally.
* **C: I te ngahere (In the bush):**  Similar to B, the bush is a location *where* you encounter sandflies, but not the time when you're most concerned.
* **D: I a koe e taraiwa ana (When you are driving):** The passage briefly mentions driving, but the core warning is about sandflies in summer, not specifically while driving.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, me aha koe kia kore ai e mahi kia kore ai e ārai i ngā waeroa i a koe e taraiwa ana i te ngahere?","The correct answer is **A: He roa rawa te tuwhera o nga tatau o te waka** (Keep the car doors open for too long).

Here's why:

The passage states that even driving through a warm rainforest, *a few seconds* of open doors allows sandflies to get *into* the car with you.  The question asks what you should do to avoid being bothered by sandflies while driving.  Keeping the doors closed (not open for too long) is the preventative measure described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: taraiwa ana i te raumati** (driving in the summer) - The passage mentions summer, but doesn't say driving in summer *causes* the problem, only that you need to be aware of sandflies *in* summer.
* **C: taraiwa ana i ngā wāhi pūroto** (driving in muddy places) - This isn't mentioned as relevant to sandflies.
* **D: Kei te mahue i te waka i te wā e hīkoi ana** (leaving the car while walking) - This isn’t mentioned in the text.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā tauākī e whai ake nei i runga i ngā Sundarbans ehara i te tika?","The correct answer is **D: He kāinga ki te tini atu o ngā hipi māka i ngā taika o Bengal**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...e ai ki te kōrero he 400 ngā tāika ariki Bengal me ngā tia korotiwhatiwha e 30,000 i roto i te wāhi."" ( ""...according to the story there are 400 Bengal tiger and 30,000 spotted deer within the area."") This means there are *fewer* tigers than deer, not more tigers than deer.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: He āhuatanga o ētahi o ngā ngahere kaha ruarua e toe ana** - The passage describes the Sundarbans as a large mangrove forest, implying it's one of the remaining significant examples of this ecosystem.
* **B: Ko te hawhe o tōna rohe tāpeke e hīpokina ana i roto i te repe** - The passage states ""...ko te kotahi-hautoru e whakakapia ana ki ngā wāhi wai/kōreporepo."" ( ""...one-third is covered by water/mudflats""). While not exactly half, it's a significant portion covered in water/mud.
* **C: Ko te tātua nui rawa tēnei o te ao** - The passage begins by stating ""Ko ngā Sundarbans ngā tātua ritora mangrove nui rawa i te ao"" (""The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world"").



"
Ko tēhea wāhanga o te ngahere e takoto ana i roto i te rohe o Indian?,"The correct answer is **A: Papa Ā-Motu o Sundarbans**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te ingoa o te wāhanga ngahere kei te rohe Inia, ko Sundarbans National Park.""  ""Papa Ā-Motu o Sundarbans"" (Sundarbans National Park) is the part of the forest located within India.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Te wahi tapu o te araora:** This refers to the delta itself, not specifically the Indian portion.
* **C: Te Pae Tuku iho o te Ao:** This refers to the UNESCO World Heritage Site designation, which applies to the entire Sundarbans, not just the Indian section.
* **D: Te mānia o Gangetic:** This refers to the Gangetic plains and isn’t a specific part of the forest.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko wai te hunga e tino mōhio ana ki te reo Ingarihi?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā tāngata taitamariki i te pakeketanga** (Young people in their generation).

Here's why:

The text states: ""He nui atu anō ngā whenua kei reira te mātauranga here - inarā ki roto i ngā rangatahi.""  This translates to ""There are many more countries where education is compulsory - especially among young people.""  This directly implies that young people are more likely to be proficient in English (and likely other languages due to education).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā tāngata e kōrero ana i ētahi atu reo e rua** (People who speak other two languages) - While multilingualism is mentioned in the broader context of language diversity, the text doesn't specifically link it to English proficiency.
*   **C: Ngā tāngata e haere ana ki Toronto** (People going to Toronto) - Toronto is used as an example of a place where people from different linguistic backgrounds gather, but it doesn't mean those people are particularly proficient in English.
*   **D: Ngā tāngata pakeke ake i te pakeke** (Older people) - The text implies the opposite, suggesting younger generations are more educated in languages like English.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te uaua ki te whakahua?","The correct answer is **D: Argot paetata**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I te nuinga o te wā he māma ake te mārama ki ngā kupu tuhituhi tēnā i ngā kupu kōrero. E pono pū ana tēnei mō te āhuatanga ki ngā wāhi noho, i te nuinga o te wā he uaua ki te whakahua tika.""

This translates to: ""Often it is easier to understand written words than spoken words. This is especially true for features related to places of residence, often it is difficult to express accurately.""

The passage highlights the difficulty of *accurately* expressing things verbally, particularly when considering regional dialects and slang – essentially, ""argot paetata"" (local slang/idiolects).  The example of the people from different cities (Mancunian, Bostonian, etc.) further emphasizes this point, as they each have their unique way of speaking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā Kupu i roto i ngā nako motuhake** (Words in specific times) - The passage doesn't mention difficulty with words related to time.
*   **B: Ngā Wāhitau** (Units) - This isn't discussed in the text.
*   **C: Ngā kupu tuhituhi** (Written words) - The passage explicitly states written words are *easier* to understand.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te āhuatanga pai mō te tangata haere e whakamahere ana ki te hopu pahi mai i te teihana ā-rohe?","The correct answer is **A: Kei te haere te kaihaere ki Jakar, ā, kua hokona kētia e ia he tīkiti i mua.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ko ērā e haere whaka te raki ana, tae atu anō hoki ki a Jakar/Bumthang ka wehe mai i te 6.30 ki te 7.30.""  This means people going to Jakar (and Bumthang) depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
* **The passage *also* states:** ""I runga i te noho kī o ngā pahi waenga-rohe i te nuinga o ngā wā, he rautaki pai te hoko tīkiti ētahi rā i mua."" This specifically recommends buying tickets in advance for popular routes, like the one to Jakar/Bumthang.

Therefore, the best characteristic of a traveler planning to take a bus from the regional station, *according to the passage*, is that they are going to Jakar and have bought a ticket in advance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the passage mentions Bumthang departures, it doesn't specify a 7:00 departure *specifically*.
* **C:** The passage focuses on departures *before* 7:30, not after 11.  Paro is also mentioned as a closer destination, suggesting a shorter travel timeframe.
* **D:** The passage doesn't mention a departure before 6:20 or a direction of ""east"" (rawhiti). It focuses on departures between 6:30 and 7:30.



"
He aha te tohutohu pai mō tētahi tūruhi e hiahia ana ki te haere ki te rawhiti mai i te teihana pahi?,"The correct answer is **B: Hokona he tīkiti tōmua (Buy a ticket in advance)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""I runga i te noho kī o ngā pahi waenga-rohe i te nuinga o ngā wā, he rautaki pai te hoko tīkiti ētahi rā i mua.""  (Due to the popularity of mid-range buses, it's a good strategy to buy tickets a few days in advance.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka haere anake ngā pahi i muri i te 8:30 (Buses only leave after 8:30)** - This is incorrect. The passage states buses leave between 6.30 and 7.30, *especially* for those going east (Jakar/Bumthang).
* **C: He maha nga pahi e haere ana puta noa te rā (Many buses run throughout the day)** - While buses run, the passage emphasizes the importance of booking ahead due to popularity, suggesting they *aren't* endlessly available.
* **D: Ko te Taxi tiritiri pea te tikanga tino atamai o te haere (A private taxi is perhaps the smartest way to travel)** - The passage mentions taxis as faster and more comfortable for short distances (Paro, Punkha) but doesn't suggest it's the ""smartest"" way *specifically from the bus station to the east*.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei kōrero e kore e tika te whakaahua o Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **D: He tāwhara tonu tēnei mo nga tūruhi pīrangi (It is always a haven for eager tourists)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ahakoa he whakamaneatanga tūruhi i runga i tōna rongo..."" This translates to ""...despite a romanticisation on its reputation...""  This implies the reputation is *romanticized* – meaning it’s perhaps *not* always a haven for tourists, and the reality might be different.  The passage suggests the reputation is overstated.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **A: He nui ake te mana o te reo Arapi i te toenga o te whenua (Arabic has more influence than the rest of the country):** The passage explicitly says, ""...he tāera Arabi tēnā i te Awherika"" (it is an Arabic city in Africa).
* **B: He rawakore te pāngia (It is relatively unaffected):** The passage mentions it’s on the list of world heritage sites in danger “i runga i te whakatuma o ngā oneone koraha” (due to encroaching desert sands) – suggesting it *is* affected, but that it’s a place of significance worth protecting.
* **C: He āheikore nā te waka rererangi (It is inaccessible due to the airport):** The passage directly states, ""...ā, he tauranga waka rererangi ki reira"" (and, there is an airport there).



Therefore, option D is the only statement *not* supported by the provided text and is, in fact, contradicted by the nuance in the phrasing about the romanticized reputation."
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka taea te Uru atu te Taone e te waka rererangi** (The town can be accessed by airplane).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ā, he tauranga waka rererangi ki reira"" - ""...and there is an airport there.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He nui kē atu te hāngai i te māngere** (It is more related to the desert) - While the passage mentions it was added to the World Heritage list due to its desert landscapes, it doesn't say it's *more* related to the desert than anything else.
* **C: He iti iho tōna āhua o Awherika i nga tāone karapoti** (Its African character is less than other cities) - The passage specifically states the opposite: ""He tīno rerekē te tāone i te toinga atu o ngā tāone o te whenua, i te mea he tāera Arabi tēnā i te Awherika."" (The town is different from other cities in the country, as it is an Arab city in Africa).
* **D: Kua kore te taone e kawe mai i nga tūruhi** (The town no longer attracts tourists) - The passage states ""he whakamaneatanga tūruhi i runga i tōna rongo"" (there is tourism based on its reputation), meaning it *does* attract tourists.



"
I te wā anō i whakaritea ai ngā whakataetae Olympics o te raumati? ,"The correct answer is **A: Ahu-2021**.

The text states: ""Ka tū Ngā Taumāhekeheke o te Ao mō te Hunga Pararūtiki atu i te 24 o Ākuhata ki te 5 o Hepetema hei te tau 2021.""  This translates to ""The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021."" 

While the text mentions issues with cancellations related to 2020, the *actual* holding of the games was in August/September 2021.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, I te wā āhea ka huri ai tētahi kōpaki hei hau-ā-rangi?","The correct answer is **A: Kia tae te hau ki te 100 maire ia haora**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka puta ngā hau kaha (100-200 mairo/haora te nuinga) ā, e āhei ana te hiki i ngā mea nui ki te rangi...""  This directly translates to ""Strong winds appear (mostly 100-200 kilometers/hour), capable of lifting large objects into the air...""

This indicates that winds reaching 100 km/h (maire is kilometers) are strong enough to become winds that lift things - essentially, becoming a significant force like a whirlwind.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Inā tīmata ngā tīwae o te hau ki te takahuri** - The passage doesn't mention anything about the *shape* of the wind changing.
* **C: I a ia e heke iho ana i nga kapua āwhā** - The passage describes the wind *coming* to the land, not descending from clouds.
* **D: I muri i te whakapā atu ki te whenua** - The passage states the whirlwind *reaches* the land, it doesn't become a whirlwind *after* contacting the land. It's the strength of the wind *before* reaching and interacting with the land that's important.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei he āhuatanga tika o te tornado?,"The correct answer is **B: I ētahi wā e neke ana me ngā ahanoa taumaha** (Sometimes they move with heavy objects).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Ka āhei ana te hiki i ngā mea nui ki te rangi, e kawea ana i te nekehanga o te awhiowhio.""  This directly translates to ""They are able to lift large objects into the sky, carrying the movement of the whirlwind."" This confirms tornadoes can move with heavy objects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I ngā wā katoa ka hangaia e rātau he hau huri noa i te 100-200 maire ia haora** (They are always created with winds rotating around 100-200 kilometers per hour) - The passage says winds *often* reach 100-200 km/h, not *always*.
* **C: I muri iho i to rātau whakapā atu ki te whenua, ka noho ngahau rātau i muri i te whakapā atu ki te whenua** (After they make contact with the land, they become calm after making contact with the land) - The passage doesn't mention anything about tornadoes becoming calm after hitting land.
* **D: Kei te takahuri tīwae rātau e pana ana i te hau ki waho** (They are rotating feet blowing air outwards) - This doesn't align with the description in the passage.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, mai i te wāhi e whiwhi tohutohu ai te tangata haere e pā ana ki te āhuatanga tōrangapū i to rātau taone ūnga?","The correct answer is **A: Mai i te kāwanatanga o te whenua ka toro atu rātou** (From the government of the country they are visiting).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka hiahia hoki pea koe ki te aro atu ki ngā tohutohu o ngā kāwanatanga atu i tō ake..."" (You may also need to pay attention to the advice of governments other than your own...).  It then goes on to explain that these governments may have different rules for different nationalities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mai i ngā tirohanga i whakaaturia i roto i te tohutohu haerenga** (From the perspectives shown in the travel advice) - The passage says travel advice is a *summary* and doesn't go into depth.
* **C: Mai i ngā Tangata whenua o te Whenua ka haere rātau** (From the Indigenous people of the Land they are visiting) - The passage doesn't mention indigenous people.
* **D: Mai i to rātau ake kāwanatanga** (From their own government) -  The passage specifically says you need to look at *other* governments' advice.



"
"Mēnā he tohutohu haere, he aha te mea e kore e taea e te tangata ke te wheako?","The correct answer is **D: Ngā mōhiohio taipitopito e pā ana ki te āhuatanga tōrangapū o te whenua.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that travel advisories offer a ""kōrero whakarāpopoto noa"" (brief summary) and are ""kāore i te hōhonu, kāore i te whāiti te titiro"" (not in-depth, not detailed) regarding a country's political situation.  Options A, B, and C are all things the passage *says* can be affected or are characteristics of travel advisories. Option D is the *one thing* the passage says they *don't* provide – detailed information.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea momo haere te iti rawa e hiahiatia ana he āwhina tāpui mai i tētahi māngai haere?","The correct answer is **A: He haerenga ki tētahi hui mahi i tētahi taone kua tae atu te kaihaereere** (A trip to a conference in a city the traveler has already been to).

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agents are most beneficial when your travel arrangements are *complex* and go beyond a traveler's usual experience (of nature, culture, language, etc.).  A trip to a conference in a city you've already visited is likely the *least* complex and most familiar type of trip listed.  You've likely handled logistics like getting to the city and finding accommodation before.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: He haere roa e rua wiki i runga i tētahi Pūtea tino roa (A two-week trip on a significant budget):**  A long trip with a substantial budget often involves many arrangements (flights, accommodation, activities) where a travel agent can be helpful.
* **C: He haere e whakaatu ana i tētahi ārai reo (A trip involving a language barrier):**  Navigating a language barrier adds complexity to travel, making a travel agent's assistance valuable.
* **D: Te haerenga tuatahi o te tangata haere ki rāwāhi (A traveler’s first overseas trip):**  First-time international travel involves a lot of unfamiliar procedures and logistics, making a travel agent a good choice.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea tauari e tino whai hua mai i te āwhina a te māngai haere?","The correct answer is **A: I te wa e tono ana te kaihaereere i ngā rerenga haerenga kia toro atu ki tō rātou taone kāinga** (When a traveler requests travel arrangements to go beyond their home country).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He kōwhiringa pai i te nuinga o te wā tētahi kaiwhakarite haerenga mō tētahi haerenga ka neke atu i te wheako o mua o tētahi tangata hāereere o te taiao, te ahurea, te reo, ngā whenua pohara rānei."" (A travel agent is often a good choice for a trip that moves beyond a traveler's previous experience of environment, culture, language, or foreign lands.)

This directly implies that someone venturing *outside* their familiar surroundings (their home country) would benefit most from a travel agent's assistance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage doesn't specify benefits for first-time expansions.
*   **C:** Knowing the local language is presented as something the *trip* might involve, not a reason to *need* an agent.
*   **D:** While cultural differences are mentioned, the passage doesn't say someone already familiar with those differences needs an agent.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te āwhina i te haere ki te karo i te matekiri i a ia e haere ana ki ngā wāhi hou?","The correct answer is **C: E haere ana ki aua ture ōrite ki te wāhi e noho ai rātau i** (To go with the same rules as the place they live in).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that things will be *different* (""ehara i te ōrite"") than ""ki te kāinga"" (home).  It lists numerous examples of differences – customs, rules, food, transport, accommodation, levels, language, etc.  To avoid disappointment (""pōuri"") or problems (""tāunu rānei""), you must *remember* these differences and adapt to the local ways.  Option C reflects this adaptation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Te tūmanako i ngā paerewa ōrite ki te wāhi i ahu mai ai rātou** (Expecting the same standards as the place they come from) – This is the *opposite* of what the passage advises. Expecting things to be the same will lead to disappointment.
* **B: He hiahia ki te whakamātau i ngā kai tauhou** (A willingness to try new foods) – While trying new foods is good, it doesn't directly address avoiding culture shock or problems arising from different customs.
* **D: Kei te karo i te rangahau o mua i runga i te nohoanga** (Avoiding pre-trip research about the accommodation) – The passage doesn't mention accommodation specifically; it focuses on broader cultural differences.  And research *is* helpful, not something to avoid.

The passage emphasizes the importance of understanding that things will be *different* when you travel. It specifically mentions differences in customs, rules, food, transport, language, etc.  It warns against disappointment or problems arising from not being prepared for these differences.

*   A person with a closed mind (hinengaro kati) would be unwilling to accept or adapt to these differences, leading to frustration and difficulties.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tētahi tangata e pīrangi ana ki ngā kai hāngai** (A person who loves familiar food) - While liking familiar food isn't *bad*, the passage doesn't suggest this is a cause of problems, only that the food *will* be different.
*   **B: Ko tētahi tangata i tipu ake i te huringa** (A person who grew up with change) - This person would likely be adaptable and *not* struggle with travel.
*   **D: Tētahi tangata e ngahau ana ki te ako** (A person who enjoys learning) - This person would be well-suited to travel and embrace the differences.

Ko tehea o ēnei tohutohu e kore e tūtohutia mō ngā kaihaereere e haere ana ki tētahi whenua whanaketanga mō te wā tuatahi?,"The correct answer is **A: Me mōhio koe ki te ao kararehe paetata i mua i te moe i runga i te whenua.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically advises *against* sleeping directly on the ground (""Kaua e moe ki runga mēterehi ki te kore koe e mōhio ki taua whenua."") and suggests bringing a travel cot or mattress *because* you don't know what creatures might be present.  It doesn't say you need to *learn about* the local wildlife beforehand, just to protect yourself *by* using a barrier.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

* **B: Karohia te pana kai i roto i ō rā tuatahi:** The passage encourages seeking out quality food (""ngā kai pai"") as part of a good welcome.
* **C: E tūtohutia ana he moenga, he moenga rānei mēnā e puni ana:** This directly reflects the advice to bring a travel cot or mattress to avoid insects and other creatures.
* **D: Whakapaipai i tētahi hotera kounga ina tae mai koe:** The passage recommends choosing quality accommodation (""ngā hōtēra whai kounga"") for a good initial experience.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e kore e whakahuatia hei mea e tika ana kia whakapau kaha ai te tangata ina haere ki tētahi whenua e whanake haere ana?,"The correct answer is **A: Kai kāhua-uru (Street food)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically advises seeking out *quality hotels, good food, and good services* to ensure a comfortable experience. It *warns* against being complacent about hygiene, particularly regarding sleeping arrangements (and implies caution about things like potentially unsanitary bedding). 

While the passage doesn't explicitly *forbid* street food, it focuses on seeking *quality* and *safe* options, implicitly suggesting caution with things that might not meet those standards.  The other options (quality hotels, good services, a bed/mat) are *directly* recommended or highlighted as important for safety and comfort.

Therefore, street food is the option least aligned with the advice given in the passage.

"Ko tēhea o ngā kōwhiringa e whai ake nei te mea pai rawa mō te kaipupuri here e hiahia ana ki tētahi tārua mariko o tōna here, engari kāore pea he uru ki te ipurangi?","The correct answer is **C: Te pupuri i tētahi tārua i rokiroki i roto i te mahara o tō rātou pona** (Keeping a copy stored in the memory of their computer).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Ki te hāereere koe ki tētahi rorohiko pōnaha, paparorohiko rānei, whakaputua tētahi tāruatanga ki tōna pūmahara, ki tētahi kōpae rānei (ka taea atu horekau te ipurangi).""  This translates to: ""If you are traveling with a laptop or computer, save a copy to its memory, or to a folder (even if there is no internet).""

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: hoatu tārua ki tētahi hoa haere (give a copy to a travel companion):** While mentioned in the passage as *an* option, it's not the best for someone *without* internet access needing a personal, readily available copy.
* **B: Īmēra ana i a rātau anō he tārua (email themselves a copy):** This requires internet access, which the question specifies might not be available.
* **D: penapena ana i tētahi tārua ki te “cloud” (save a copy to the ""cloud""):** This *definitely* requires internet access.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e kore e kitea i roto i te kaupapahere?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā tau waea aowhānui mō te mahi kerēme** (General phone numbers for filing a claim).

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions:

* **B:** The email address of the contact person (kaihautū) - ""Me whakaatu atu e rātou te īmēra...""
* **C:** Phone numbers for confirmation - ""...nama waea kia whiwhi tohutohu/whakamanatanga...""
* **D:**  Keeping a copy of the policy and contact details for yourself (the policy holder) - ""...tukua he īmera ki a koe ake me te āpitihanga, ka penapenatia rānei ki te """"kapua"""".""

However, it *doesn't* mention needing general phone numbers specifically *for* the claim filing process itself. It only asks for the contact person's phone number for instructions and confirmation.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea rahi tōraro e whakaatu ana i te hōputu pikitia e tino whakamahia nuitia ana?","The correct answer is **D: 36 x 24 mm tōraro**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te tewe aro whānui 35 mm (36 ki te 24 mm te whakaahua takahuri) te mea kei te tino whakamahia.""  This translates to ""The wide-angle lens 35 mm (36 to 24 mm image size) is the most widely used.""

Therefore, 36 x 24 mm represents the most commonly used image size (negative size).



"
Ko tēhea o ngā hōputu whitiāhua e whai ake nei e tuku ana i te taumira e ōrite ana ki tētahi DSLR?,"The correct answer is **A: Whitiāhua 35 mm**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ka āhua ōrite te ariari ki tētahi DSLF o nāianei"" (the sensor looks similar to a current DSLR) when referring to the wide-angle 35mm format.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Whitiāhua Hōputu-waenga (Medium Format):** The passage contrasts medium format (like 6x6cm) *with* the DSLR equivalent.
* **C: Whitiāhua 56 x 56 mm:** While mentioned, this is a larger format, not comparable to a DSLR.
* **D: Whitiāhua 6 x 6 cm:** This is a significantly larger format than a DSLR sensor.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei te hipanga whakamutunga i te tīmatanga o tētahi umanga tuhituhi haere?","The correct answer is **C: Hangaia tō ake paetukutuku** (Create your own website).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Whai muri i tō taunga ki te hōputu me te kotikoti i runga i te ipurangi, nāwai rā, ka hiahia pea koe ki te hanga i tō ake pae tukutuku.""  This translates to ""After gaining experience with freelancing and online bidding, you may then want to create your own website.""  This is presented as the *final* step mentioned in the passage, following the initial steps of building skills and freelancing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Whakaharatau i te hōputu tukutuku** (Test website bidding) - This is a step *before* creating a website, mentioned earlier in the passage.
*   **B: Tuhia ētahi tuhinga mō tētahi rangitaki haerenga rongonui** (Write some content for a popular travel blog) - This is a way to *build* skills, not the final step in starting a business.
*   **D: Kia pono ō pūkenga whakatika** (Ensure your editing skills) - Again, this is about skill development, a foundational step, not the last one mentioned.



"
"I te wā e tīmata ana i tētahi pakihi tuhi haerenga, ko tēhea o ngā āheinga e whai ake nei e tika ana kia whakahoutia i te tuatahi?","The correct answer is **B: Hōputu tukutuku (Website portfolio)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states that after gaining experience freelancing on established platforms (""taunga ki te hōputu me te kotikoti i runga i te ipurangi""), the next logical step is building your own website.  A website portfolio is *essential* for a travel writing business to showcase your work to potential clients.

Let's look at why the other options are less important *initially*:

*   **A: Rangitaki (Marketing):** Marketing is important, but you need something *to* market first – your writing samples.
*   **C: Whakarerekē ana (Editing):** Editing skills are crucial for *doing* the writing, but not the first thing to establish for the *business* itself.
*   **D: Waihanga paetukutuku (Website creation):** This is the *action* of building a website, but the **portfolio** *on* the website is what's key initially. You need content (your writing) to put on the website.



"
He aha te momo āhuarangi e kitea nuitia ana ngā Raruraru Whakamātautau?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngā āhuarangi wera** (Warm climates).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""i te nuinga o te wā he mātua tiotio engari ehara i te tino mōrearea"" (usually mild but not seriously dangerous) *in warmer climates*. It also details how warmer temperatures accelerate the growth and lifespan of bacteria causing illnesses like Delhi Belly, Pharaoh's curse, and Montezuma's revenge – all associated with warm climates.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā āhuarangi mātao** (Cold climates) - The text contrasts warm climates with cold climates, saying respiratory issues are common in cold climates, but diarrheal problems are more common in warm ones.
*   **B: āhuarangi pākoki** (Temperate climates) - While these illnesses *can* occur in temperate climates, the text focuses on their prevalence and increased risk in warmer temperatures.
*   **D: Ngā āhua āhuarangi maroke** (Dry climates) - While some of these illnesses could occur in dry climates, the text's primary focus is on temperature and its effect on bacterial growth, linking it specifically to warm climates.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ka āhei te mārakerake auau ki te āraitanga o te aha?","The correct answer is **B: Germs Paetata** (which translates to ""intestinal germs"").

Here's why:

The passage states ""...ka nui ake te tupono ka raru koe"" (you are more likely to get sick) due to ""ngā kīrehe e tauhou ana ki a koe"" (germs new to you).  It then lists examples of illnesses caused by these germs like Delhi Belly, Pharaoh's curse, and Montezuma's revenge.  The passage is discussing the increased risk of getting sick from *germs* in new environments.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā raruraru whakamātautau (Testing problems):** The passage isn't about problems with testing.
*   **C: Ngā raruraru roma (Stomach problems):** While the illnesses mentioned *cause* stomach problems, the passage focuses on the *source* of those problems - the germs.
*   **D: Delhi Belly:** Delhi Belly is an *example* of a potential illness, not what the mārakerake auau (travel) increases your susceptibility *to*.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he painga o te haere i roto i te rohe o Rōpū?,"The correct answer is **A: Kei te karo i ngā taupānga visa maha** (Avoiding multiple visa applications).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Me te mea hoki, mā te mau i tētahi visa Schengen me tono motuhake koe mō ngā visas kei ia o ngā whenua mema Schengen, ā, koira e maha ake te wā, te moni me ngā pepamahi."" (However, with a Schengen visa, you would have to apply separately for visas in each of the Schengen member countries, and that takes more time, money and paperwork).  The Schengen zone *avoids* this multiple application process.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Tiaki moni ana** (Saving money) - While avoiding multiple visa fees saves money, it’s a *result* of the main benefit, not the benefit itself.
* **C: Kei te karo i ngā wāhitaki mana uruwhenua maha** (Avoiding multiple immigration checks) - The passage *also* mentions this (""ka taea e koe te whakawhiti i ngā rohe, ā, ehara i te mea me haere anō mā ngā tirotiro kaitiaki uruwhenua""), but the primary benefit highlighted is the visa simplification.
* **D: Kāore he whakaritenga uruwhenua** (No immigration requirements) - This is incorrect. You still need a Schengen visa to enter, so there *are* immigration requirements.



"
He aha te mea kua kore e kitea i roto i te urupa o Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **D: Nga taonga** (The treasures).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kāore ngā rawa mīharo o te toma i te noho tonu ki roto rā, engari kua haria ki te Egyptian Museum, ki Cairo."" This translates to ""The magnificent treasures of the tomb are no longer in it, but have been moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ētahi whakakotahitanga (Some combinations)** - The text doesn't mention combinations.
* **B: Te māhunga o te whakapakoko (The head of the sarcophagus)** - The text says only the head and shoulders were visible.
* **C: Nga pakihiwi o te whakapakoko (The shoulders of the sarcophagus)** - The text says only the head and shoulders were visible.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tehea te ūnga o Vancouver e iti rawa te ahuareka ki ngā kaihaereere e mōhio ana ki te utu? ","The correct answer is **C: Te Motu o Bowen**.

Here's why:

The passage states Bowen Island is easily accessible by ferries leaving from Granville Island (in the centre of Vancouver) and offers a range of activities (hiking, shops, restaurants etc.). It's presented as a more affordable alternative to Whistler, which is expensive.  Therefore, Bowen Island would be the most appealing option for travellers mindful of cost.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te Motu o Granville:** Granville Island is a *departure point* to get *to* Bowen Island, not a destination itself described as having activities and being cost-effective.
*   **B: Te Moana ki te pānui rangi:** This refers to a hiking trail *on* Bowen Island, not the destination itself.
*   **D: whio:** This word doesn't appear in the passage and is not a place mentioned.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea ūnga e tino tuku ana i tētahi wheako Vancouver tūturu?","The correct answer is **A: Te Motu o Bowen (Bowen Island)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically describes Bowen Island as a destination offering recreation, hiking, shops, restaurants, and being easily accessible from Vancouver via ferry. It's presented as a community *near* Vancouver, offering a getaway experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Whio** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Downtown Vancouver** - The passage states Bowen Island is *near* Vancouver and offers an escape *from* the city centre.
* **D: Te Motu o Granville (Granville Island)** - While mentioned as the ferry departure point, Granville Island is a location *within* Vancouver, not a destination offering a separate experience.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, āhea haere ai nga kaihoko ki nga hinganga mehemea kai te rapu rātau i ngā tirohanga kāore i te mōhiotia?","The correct answer is **D: I waho o te wā marangai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka mākū koe mēna koe ka whakawhiti i te piriti, ka hīkoi rānei i te huarahi kōpikopiko e tata ana ki te wairere. Engari hoki, nā te nui o te wai i pērā ai, ā, ka rehurehu noa tō titiro atu ki ngā wairere- kei ngā wāhi katoa!"" 

This translates to: ""You will get soaked if you cross the bridge or walk the path close to the waterfall. However, because of the amount of water, your view of the waterfalls will be obscured - everywhere!""

This means the best views (less obscured) are *not* during the rainy season (November to March - when the water is highest).  Therefore, visiting **outside the rainy season** would offer clearer views.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Whiringa ā-rangi tae noa ki Mati (November to March):** This is *when* views are most obscured.
*   **B: I te wa o te tuuruhi (During the mist):** The mist is *caused* by the water, and obscures the view.
*   **C: Ina teitei te rōrahi wai (When the water level is high):**  High water levels are what cause the obscured views.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te taha ki te haere ki Wikitōria Falls i waenganui o Whiringa me Mati?","The correct answer is **C: Tirohanga whakaharahara o te taka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I te wā ua rawa o te tau (Noema tae atu ki Māehe), ka teitei ake te rōrahi wai, ā, ka wheriko ake ngā Wairere."" (During the rainy season (November to March), the water volume increases, and the waterfalls become more spectacular.) 

This directly translates to a more impressive/exciting view of the falls during that time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā tirohanga kāore i te mōhiotia o ngā hinganga** (Views are obscured of the falls) - The passage states the opposite - the falls are *more* visible.
*   **B: He torutoru ake nga tūruhi** (More tours are available) - The passage doesn't mention the number of tours.
*   **D: Kei te karo i te wā marangai** (Avoiding peak season) - The passage focuses on the *benefits* of visiting during the rainy season, not avoiding it.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i te taunakitia ina whakamahi i tētahi drone ki te pikitia?","The correct answer is **A: Taki tōmua ana i ngā mea e whakaaetia ana koe ki te whitiāhua** (Assuming/taking for granted what you are allowed to film).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: **""Ki te whakamahia tētahi matatopa, me ui atu koe i mua rawa he aha e whakaaetia ana te mau kiriata, ā, he aha ngā whakaaetanga, ngā raihana tāpiri e hiahiatia ana.""** (When using a drone, you must first ask what filming is permitted, and what permissions, additional licenses are required).

This directly contradicts taking it for granted what you're allowed to film - you *must* ask first.

Let's look at why the other options are *supported* by the passage:

* **B: Kei te pupuri i ētahi atu raihanatanga** (Holding other licenses) - The passage mentions needing ""additional licenses"" which supports this.
* **C: Ngā whakaaetanga rangahau** (Research permissions) -  While not specifically mentioned, ""permissions"" is broad enough to include research permissions.
* **D: E whakaata ana i ngā wāhi pūruru anake e kore ai e kitea te drone** (Filming only in private areas where the drone isn't visible) - This isn't explicitly mentioned, but it's a reasonable precaution and doesn't contradict anything in the passage.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, kei hea ngā wāhi tino pai hei whitiāhua mā te whakamahi i te drone?","The correct answer is **D: I ngā wāhi kua whiwhi koe i ngā whakaaetanga o mua mō** (In places where you have obtained prior permissions for).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ki te whakamahia tētahi matatopa, me ui atu koe i mua rawa he aha e whakaaetia ana te mau kiriata, ā, he aha ngā whakaaetanga, ngā raihana tāpiri e hiahiatia ana."" (If using a drone, you must ask in advance what filming is permitted, and what permissions, additional rights are needed.)

This directly emphasizes the importance of obtaining permissions *before* filming with a drone.  The other options are either incorrect based on the text (avoiding people, avoiding restricted areas, secrecy aren't the primary focus) or potentially illegal (filming in restricted areas).



"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, ehara i te tika te tauākī e pā ana ki te whakaritenga rēhitatanga mō te tukanga visa?","The correct answer is **D: I ētahi wāhi, ka taea e ngā hotera o te rohe te whakahaere i te rēhitatanga.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ki ngā tini whenua me tētahi ture pērā, ka whakarite ngā hōtēra ā-rohe i te rēhitatanga (me mātua tono atu).""  This directly translates to: ""In many countries with such a law, local hotels will arrange registration (and must be asked to do so).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mēnā kei te noho koe i ngā whare tūruhi, kāore pea koe e hiahia ki te rēhita** - While the passage mentions tourists *sometimes* needing to register, it doesn't say they *never* need to. It says it's complex and varies.
* **B: Me rēhita ngā whenua katoa ki ngā mana ā rohe** - The passage states registration requirements *vary* depending on the location and length of stay, not that everyone *always* has to register.
* **C: E hiahiatia ana pea he toro ki ngā tari nekeneke** - The passage mentions potentially needing to submit paperwork to police or immigration, but doesn't definitively state a visit is *required*.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei ehara i te wāhi tūruhi ka haere pea ki te whakahaere i to rātau rēhitatanga?,"The correct answer is **C: He tari poutāpeta paetata (A nearby post office)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...pea me whakakī te pepa nei me ngā pirihimana o te rohe, i tētahi toronga atu rānei ki te tari manene.""  This translates to ""...you may need to submit this paper to the local police, or at a distant immigration office.""

* **A: He teihana pirihimana o te rohe (A local police station)** - Mentioned directly in the passage *as a place to register*.
* **B: Te hōtēra e noho ana rātau (The hotel they are staying at)** - The passage states hotels *facilitate* registration, they aren't a registration *location* for everyone.
* **C: He tari poutāpeta paetata (A nearby post office)** - Not mentioned in the text as a place to register.
* **D: Nga tari nekeneke (Immigration offices)** - Mentioned in the passage *as a place to register* (though potentially distant).

Therefore, a nearby post office is the only option not presented as a potential place for registration.



"
Ko wai e kore e whai hua i te mahi tūao i a ia e haere ana?,"The correct answer is **B: Ko tētahi tangata e kimi ana i tētahi utu nui** (Someone looking for a large payment).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that volunteering can *help* extend your travel budget because many volunteer positions offer accommodation and food, effectively reducing costs. It even says it's a way to live longer in a place for ""a few dollars.""  Someone seeking a *large* payment would be disappointed by volunteering, as it's generally unpaid or offers only basic support in lieu of a salary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ko tētahi tangata e tūmanako ana kia noho hoa hou ki rāwāhi** (Someone hoping to make new friends abroad) - The passage *encourages* meeting new people through volunteering.
* **C: Ko tētahi e tumanako ana ki te whiwhi i tētahi pūkenga hou** (Someone hoping to gain a new skill) - The passage says volunteering leads to gaining new skills.
* **D: Tētahi tangata e hiahia ana pea ki te rūma me te papa** (Someone who might want a room and board) -  The passage explains that many volunteer positions *provide* room and board.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he pēhea te tono i a rātau e whai hua ana ki tētahi haere i runga i te tahua?","The correct answer is **C: I ētahi wā ka tukuna te rūma me te poari**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...he maha ngā mahi tūao ka tuku i te nōhanga me te kai..."" which translates to ""...many volunteer jobs offer accommodation and food...""  This directly supports option C, stating that room and board are sometimes offered.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tata tonu te utu i ngā wā katoa** (The cost is always low) - While the passage says it can help extend your budget, it doesn't say the cost is *always* low.
* **B: I te nuinga o te wā ka ahu atu ki ngā wāhi mahi** (It usually leads to job opportunities) - The passage mentions gaining skills, but doesn't explicitly state it *usually* leads to job opportunities.
* **D: Mā tēnei koe e āwhina kia whiwhi koe ki tētahi tirohanga** (This will help you get a perspective) - While volunteering *can* offer perspective, the passage discusses many benefits, not just this one, and it's not the primary focus of the sentence discussing cost.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, He aha te mea e kiia ana he rerekē i te haerenga noa ki Walt Disney World?","The correct answer is **C: E tārewa ana i te katoa o te haere i runga i te āhuatanga Disney**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a ""typical"" Disney World trip as: flying into Orlando, staying at a Disney hotel *without leaving the Disney area* for a week, and then returning home. This means the entire experience is contained within the Disney ""bubble.""  The passage contrasts this with people buying discounted, partially used tickets, implying that deviating from the full Disney experience (like using cheaper, non-full-access tickets) is a difference from the standard trip.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E tārewa ana i te wiki e hōpara ana i ngā pāka** - While spending a week at the parks is *part* of the typical trip, it's not what *defines* the difference.
*   **B: E noho ana i tētahi hōtēra i waho o te whare** - The passage specifically says staying at a *Disney* hotel is part of the typical trip.
*   **D: Mauria he pahi mai i te taunga rererangi ki te hōtēra** -  This is just a logistical detail of the trip, not what distinguishes a typical trip from a different one.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki te Ao Disney ehara i te tika?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka taea te whakawhiti i ngā tīkiti Papa-hopper ki ētahi atu haere** (Tickets can be transferred to other trips).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""**he kore-whakawhiti ngā tīkiti**"" (tickets are non-transferable). This directly contradicts option A.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **B: He nohoanga i runga i te pae e wātea ana** (There is lodging available on site) - The passage mentions staying at a Disney hotel for a week.
*   **C: Tērā ētahi pahi e wātea ana ki te kawe haere mai i te wāhi rererangi ki te āhuatanga** (There are shuttles available to travel from the airport to the resort) - The passage says you fly into Orlando and then go to the Disney hotel.
*   **D: Ka kitea ngā tīkiti rā-maha i ngā paetukutuku hoko** (Multi-day tickets are found on resale websites) - The passage explicitly states tickets are sold on sites like eBay and Craigslist.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā take e whai ake nei kāore pea e hipa i roto i tētahi karaehe whakangungu ngaio, i ngā tānga rānei?","The correct answer is **C: takahanga rohe pakanga (combat zone scenarios)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...he nui ngā pukapuka me ngā makahīni e kōrero ana mō te mōrehutanga ki te wao, heoi ehara i te mea he nui ngā putanga e pā ana ki ngā wāhi pakanga."" 

This translates to: ""There are many books and resources about survival in the wilderness, *however, there aren't many publications relating to combat zones*."" 

This indicates that training specifically focused on combat zone scenarios is *less likely* to be included in the professional training described.

Let's look at why the other options are likely to be included:

* **A: Ora o te Wilderness (Wilderness Survival)** - The entire passage revolves around preparing for a potentially dangerous environment, heavily implying wilderness survival skills.
* **B: Whakaritenga Āwhina Tuatahi (First Aid Certification)** - The passage explicitly mentions ""he nui te āwhina tuatahi"" (a lot of first aid).
* **D: E purei ana te tūranga (Positioning/Staging)** - While not directly stated, planning and preparation for a trip to a dangerous area would logically involve staging and positioning considerations.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kaupapa e whai ake nei ka hipahia i roto i tētahi karaehe whakangungu ngaio?","The correct answer is **A: Āwhina tuatahi (First Aid)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...he nui te āwhina tuatahi, ā, i ētahi wā he whakangungu rākau."" This directly translates to ""...a lot of first aid, and sometimes bushcraft training."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngā rohe pakanga (Conflict zones):** While the training is *for* someone deploying to a conflict zone, the training itself doesn't focus *on* conflict zones as a subject. It's focused on survival skills.
* **C: Ora o te Wilderness (Wilderness survival):** While related, the passage says there are many books on wilderness survival, but *not many* publications directly relating to conflict zones. This suggests it's not a core component of the professional training.
* **D: Ngā taiao kaihautū (Leadership environments):** This isn't mentioned at all in the passage.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te kōwhiringa tino pai mo te karo i te wai tāhae?","The correct answer is **B: Hoko wai pounamu** (Buy bottled water).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...mehemea he āwangawanga tāu, me whai whakaaro koe ki te hoko i tō wai ki tētahi pātara kua kōpanitia mai i tētahi kamupene e mōhiotia ana.""  This translates to ""...if you are concerned, you should consider buying your water in a bottle organized from a known company.""  This directly suggests buying bottled water as the best option to avoid contaminated water.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wai kōhua mō ngā meneti maha** (Boiling water for many minutes) - The passage mentions boiling, but doesn't present it as the *best* option, and highlights varying boil times.
*   **C: wai kōhua mo te meneti kotahi** (Boiling water for one minute) - The passage states boiling times *vary* and can be *longer* than one minute.
*   **D: Ka tohu i te wai mō ngā tuma tauwhāiti** (Marking water for small amounts) - This isn't mentioned in the passage at all.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea e kore e taea ahakoa mo nga kaikau pūkenga?","The correct answer is **C: Kei te haere ki tētahi o nāianei**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngana ki te aro atu ki tētahi wāhi kāore koe e mau anō, i runga rānei i ō pukenga, i tō kitea atu rānei, me tatari pea koe kia whakarauoratia.""  This translates to: ""Focus on a place you are not familiar with, based on your skills or what you see, and you may need to wait to be released.""

This implies that even skilled swimmers can find themselves in a situation where they are *unsure of where they are* and need to wait for rescue.  The passage suggests being disoriented is something even experienced individuals can encounter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E tata ana ki te ākau (Being close to a tree):** The passage mentions trees as a general location for rip currents, not as something that defeats skilled swimmers.
* **B: E mau ana i roto i te wai hōhonu (Being caught in deep water):**  The passage describes how the seafloor drops, leading to deeper water, but doesn't say skilled swimmers *can't* handle that.
* **D: Kei te huri haere i ngā ngaru (Going around the waves):**  The passage doesn't suggest that navigating waves is a particular challenge for skilled swimmers; it focuses on the dangers of rip currents.

Me aha koe ki te mau koe i tētahi o nāianei?,"The correct answer is **A: Whakamātauria kia puta atu i te rere mā te ū ki tētahi atu aronga, kātahi ka kaukau atu ki te takutai i te tikanga.**

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

* **The passage describes rip currents (ngā ia kauere).** It explains they pull you *away* from shore.
* **The key advice is to not fight the current directly.** (""Ko te kaukau kia hoki atu kāore e uaua ake i te kaukau i te nuinga o te wā."")  Fighting it tires you out.
* **Instead, the passage suggests swimming *parallel* to shore.** (""Whakamātauria kia puta atu i te rere mā te ū ki tētahi atu aronga, kātahi ka kaukau atu ki te takutai i te tikanga."") This allows you to swim *out* of the rip current's pull, then swim back to shore.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tere ake te kauhoe ki te mea o nāianei:**  Speeding up your paddling *into* the rip will only exhaust you faster.
* **C: Kaukau ki te ahunga hangai:** Swimming directly towards the destination (shore) is what you *shouldn't* do.
* **D: kaukau i raro i te mata:**  Swimming underwater is dangerous and won't help you escape the rip current.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea tauwāhi e haere ai ki tētahi maka, he whakangahau hararei whai painga?","The correct answer is **A: He taone i te taha o Danube**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions taking a boat trip (""rerenga waka"") to ""tāone nui manawa reka ki te Danube"" (major cities along the Danube). This directly suggests the Danube as a destination for a rewarding holiday experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I te taha o te Awa o Erie:** While the Erie Canal is mentioned, the passage doesn't position it as a particularly *rewarding* holiday experience in the same way as the Danube.
* **C: I te Awaawa o Rhine:** The Rhine valley is mentioned, but not as a destination for a boat trip or particularly rewarding experience like the Danube.
* **D: Tata ki tētahi arawai o te whenua:** This is too general. The passage uses waterways *as guides* for travel, but doesn't specifically suggest traveling *near* any waterway as a holiday destination in itself.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei e kore e tūtohutia mō ngā wāhine e haere ana ki te rohe?","The correct answer is **C: Kaua e mau i te Hurai kōhiko (Don't accept a ring)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: *""engari kia kaua tētahi he nui te utu o tōna āhua. (but not one that is expensive in appearance)""* and that accepting a ring could lead to complications and potentially being pursued.  It's cautioning against accepting expensive gifts, particularly rings, from men in the region.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kia kaua e kōrerorero i te tūnga taua (Don't discuss important status):**  The text doesn't mention avoiding discussions about status.
* **B: Kia mōhio he rerekē te ahurea ka whakaoho ai i te kaha o te iwi (Be aware that cultural differences can ignite passion):** The passage *does* emphasize cultural awareness, suggesting it's important to understand how actions might be perceived.
* **D: Whakamahia te uaua ina hiahiatia (Use firmness when needed):** The passage encourages being strong and not being afraid to stand firm, even with cultural differences.



"
"I runga anō i te rohe i whakaahuatia i roto i te wāhanga, he aha te tohutohu āwhina mō ngā wāhine haere?","The correct answer is **C: Kia mōhio koe ki ngā rerekētanga ahurea e hua ana kia kore koe e tū i tō whenua.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Kia mōhio te wahine he rerekētanga ahurea ka ahu atu pea ki ngā mahi e whai whakaarotia ana e rātou he whakatīwheta..."" (The woman needs to be aware of cultural differences that may lead to actions they consider offensive...).  This directly advises women travelers to be aware of cultural differences to avoid misunderstandings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E mōhio ana koe he kore noa iho te whai i a ia** - This doesn't relate to advice for female travelers in the described region.
* **B: Wear he rīngi nui hei tohu i te Tūnga taua** - While the passage mentions rings, it specifically says *not* a large, expensive one.  It doesn't recommend wearing a ring *as* a status symbol.
* **D: I te take o ngā nekehanga tē hiahiatia, kia kaha ki te huri i ngā tāngata** -  The passage emphasizes *avoiding* unwanted advances by being assertive and not being afraid to stand firm (""Kia kaha ki te whakakahore i te tāne...""), not by trying to change people.



"
"I runga anō i te wāhanga, tērā pea ka hiahiatia e tētahi kaiwhakaahua kararehe hei whakamahi i tētahi arotahi motuhake?","The correct answer is **A: Mēnā kei te whakaahua rātou i ngā Waihanga iti rawa** (If they are photographing very small creatures).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ahakoa ērā pērā ki ngā kāhui manu me ngā ngārara itiiti nei, me mau i ētahi atu karaehe."" ( ""...even those like bird flocks and small reptiles, need other lenses."") This directly implies that a special lens (a macro lens, likely) is *needed* when photographing small creatures to get detailed shots.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mēnā kei te whakamahia ngā whakaahua mō ngā take arumoni** (If the photos are being used for commercial purposes) - The passage mentions commercial photography restrictions, but not a *need* for a special lens.
* **C: Kia whakaahuatia nga kararehe, he whakamā** (To photograph animals, shy) - Shyness of animals doesn't dictate lens choice.
* **D: Mēnā he ture motuhake tā te pāka e pā ana ki te whakaahua waiora** (If the park has specific rules regarding wildlife photography) - Rules might exist, but don't inherently require a special lens.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i kōrerotia i roto i te whakawhitinga hei uaua tērā pea mō ngā kaiwhakaahua kararehe?,"The correct answer is **B: E mahi ana ki ngā kararehe whakatuki (Working with trained animals)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses the challenges of photographing *wild* animals.** It mentions the difficulty of *finding* animals, dealing with their unpredictable behaviour (""whakamā, he ririhau rānei"" - shy or dangerous), and navigating challenging environments.  It specifically focuses on the difficulties inherent in photographing animals *in their natural habitat*.
* **""Kararehe whakatuki"" (trained animals)** aren't addressed at all.  The challenges discussed are all related to photographing animals behaving naturally, not those accustomed to human interaction.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

* **A: Kimi ana i ētahi kararehe pātata (Finding elusive animals):** The passage explicitly states ""He uaua te kimi i ngā kararehe hou"" (It is difficult to find new animals).
* **C: E hiahiatia ana te momo arotahi (Needing a certain focus/lens):** The passage details needing different lenses (""karaehe"") for various subjects, from wide landscapes to small birds and insects.
* **D: E mahi ana i ngā taiao tūkino pea (Working in potentially hazardous environments):**  The passage mentions the environment being cold, hot, or wet (""Ko te taiao he makariri, he wera, he taraweti anō rānei"").



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ka iti ake pea ngā raruraru mō tētahi atekōkiri e haere ana i te maunga?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā waka taumaha (Heavy vehicles)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses the dangers of driving in mountainous areas:** It mentions snow, ice, extremely cold temperatures, slippery roads, and the potential for being stuck. It also talks about the impact of wind and drifting snow on visibility.
* **Heavy vehicles are better equipped to handle these conditions:** While not explicitly stated, it's generally understood that heavier vehicles (like trucks or SUVs) have better traction, stability, and are less susceptible to being blown around by wind or getting stuck in snow compared to lighter vehicles.  The passage implies needing something substantial to 'hold' you in difficult conditions (""kia mau koe i te wā poto rawa"").
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Te wā iti (Short time):** A shorter trip doesn't lessen the inherent dangers of the environment.
    * **C: Ōritetanga e hiahiatia ana (Balance required):** While balance is important for *any* driving, it doesn't address the specific hazards the passage describes.
    * **D: kua whakahekea te Aritanga (Reduced friction):**  The passage *describes* reduced friction (ice, snow) as a problem – you wouldn't *want* reduced friction!



Therefore, **Ngā waka taumaha** is the most logical answer as it suggests a vehicle type better suited to overcome the challenges outlined in the passage."
He aha pea ka noho ōrite tonu mō te tāke moni whiwhi puta noa i ngā whenua maha?,"The correct answer is **B: Hanganga (Structure)**.

Here's why:

The passage explains that tax systems vary *greatly* between countries, with different levels (federal, state/provincial, local) and rates. This implies that while the *details* change, the *fundamental structure* of needing to pay income tax on earnings, regardless of where you live, is likely to be consistent across many countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā Mokatere (The amounts):** The passage specifically states that tax *rates* vary significantly.
*   **C: Te wāhi e kōnae ai koe (Where you live):**  The passage emphasizes that location dramatically impacts taxes due to different jurisdictions.
*   **D: Ngā Taiapa (The benefits):** While taxes fund benefits, the passage focuses on the *collection* of tax, not what it's spent on.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, mēnā kei te mahi koe ki rāwāhi, engari i tētahi atu wāhi, ka whakakōnaetia e koe ō tāke moni whiwhinga?","The correct answer is **C: I te whenua e mahi ana koe i tēnei wā**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that if you work abroad, you need to pay income tax to **the country you reside in**. Option C directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kei hea koe i te nuinga o te wā** - While residency is important, the passage focuses on where the income is *earned* and therefore taxed, not just general location.
*   **B: I Te Hononga o Amerika** - This is too specific. The passage discusses tax obligations generally, not specifically to the USA.
*   **D: Kei hea ngā utu te mea iti rawa** - This relates to tax *rates*, but the question asks *where* taxes are paid, not about the amount.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā tauākī e whai ake nei kāore e whakaahua tika ana i te Tika o te Ao?,"The correct answer is **D: Kāore e hiahiatia ana ngā whenua kia whai wāhi.**

Here's why:

The passage states that countries *participate* in the World Exposition by showcasing their art and educational displays. This implies participation is a key element, not something optional. Saying participation isn't required contradicts the text.

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurate based on the passage:

* **A: Ka whakaaturia pea e ngā whakaaturanga te hītori, te ahurea rānei o tētahi whenua** - The passage explicitly states this: ""...whakaatu i ngā take o te ao, i te ahurea, hītori rānei o tō rātou whenua.""
* **B: Ka whakaaturia ngā whakaaturanga Botanical i te taha o ngā whakaaturanga tohunga, akoranga hoki** - The passage mentions ""ngā whakaaturanga putiputi, ngā mahi ahumāra"" alongside more general ""māhi mātauranga.""
* **C: Ka taea e ngā takahanga te tae atu ki te ono marama** - The passage states the expositions last ""te toru ki te ono marama.""



"
"Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he ture no te hanganga Tika, ao whānui rānei o te Ao?","The correct answer is **A: Me whakakite e ngā whakaaturanga ngā hītori me ngā take o te ao** (Exhibitions must showcase world histories and issues).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Kei te whakaatu ngā whenua e whai wāhi ana i ngā whakaaturanga ā-toi, ā-mātauranga ki ngā whare ā-motu hei whakaatu i ngā take o te ao, i te ahurea, hītori rānei o tō rātou whenua."" (Participating countries present artistic and educational exhibitions in national pavilions to showcase world issues, culture, or the history of their country.) This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kāore e taea e te whenua kotahi te taurima i ngā takahanga i ia tau** (No single country can host the exhibitions every year) - The passage says they *can* be held annually, but aren't *guaranteed* to be. It doesn't prohibit a country from hosting.
* **C: Me tae ki te ono marama te roa o ngā takahanga** (Exhibitions must last up to six months) - The passage states they last ""three to six months,"" meaning it's a range, not a requirement of six months.
* **D: Kia puritia ai te ataahua, me whai wāhi ngā whenua katoa** (To maintain beauty, all countries must participate) - The passage doesn't mention anything about requiring all countries to participate or maintaining 'beauty'.



"
Mā te mahi ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ka whakahekea te āheinga ki te whakaeke kararehe?,"The correct answer is **C: Kei te pupuri i tētahi tawhiti 25 whārangi mai i ngā wuruhi** (Maintaining a distance of 25 meters from the deer).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...me noho tonu te 100 iari/mita atu i ngā pea me ngā wuruhi me te 25 iari/mita atu i ērā atu kararehe mohoao katoa!"" (You must stay 100 meters from the pigs and deer and 25 meters from all other wild animals!).  Maintaining this distance is a *requirement* to avoid disturbing and potentially being attacked by the animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E mau ana i ngā otaota aro** (Holding quiet thoughts) - While being calm might help, it isn't a *physical action* to reduce attack risk and isn't mentioned in the text.
* **B: Tango ana i te peke i te puni** (Taking the bag around) -  This is related to food smells and attracting animals, increasing risk, not decreasing it.
* **D: E whakakāhore ana i ngā kararehe whai maka kai** (Ignoring food-seeking animals) - Ignoring them doesn't protect you; it could make the situation more dangerous.  The text emphasizes avoiding *attracting* them with food.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i kōrerotia i roto i te whakawhitinga hei take pea o ngā whakaekenga o te waiora?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā kakara kaha (Strong smells)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""kia kamakama ka hau mai ngā pea me ngā atu kararehe puihi i te mea o ngā kakara, nā me ngana kia kauka e kawe e tunu rānei i ngā kai kakara, ā, me mā hoki te puni.""  This translates to: ""Pea and other animals are attracted by smells, so try to avoid carrying or cooking smelly food, and empty the trash.""  Therefore, smells *are* mentioned as an attractant, not a cause of attacks.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned as factors relating to animal encounters/potential attacks:

* **B: Rahunga ki te pupuri tawhiti (Failure to keep a distance):** The passage heavily emphasizes maintaining specific distances from animals (""me noho tonu te 100 iari/mita atu i ngā pea me ngā wuruhi me te 25 iari/mita atu i ērā atu kararehe mohoao katoa!"").  Violating these distances leads to issues.
* **C: Whāngai ana i te waiora (Feeding the wildlife):** The passage directly warns against feeding animals (""me kauaka e whāngai e whakahōhā rānei."").
* **D: Ngā kararehe tauhou ki te tangata (Animals becoming accustomed to humans):** The passage implies this is a problem when it says the animals become ""niwhaniwha tonu"" (bold/unafraid) and are incorrectly approached due to a lack of proper distance.



Therefore, strong smells are not presented as a cause of animal attacks in the provided text."
