"Kolanda maloba wana, nini ekoki te kondimama lokola sekele pona kobeta accordeon malamu?","The correct answer is **D: Matisa vitesi oyo ozali kosalela soufflet pona kobakisa volime** (Adjust the speed you use the bellows to maintain volume).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""...na accordéon, mpona kozwa volime mosusu, okosalela eloko babengi soufflet makasi to na vitese mingi."" ( ""...with the accordion, I want to get more volume, operate the bellows powerfully and at high speed."") This directly links bellows speed (vitesse) to volume control.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pona komatisa volime , matisa makasi oyo ozali kofina na yango bilembo** (To adjust volume, press harder on the buttons) -  While button pressure affects notes, it doesn't primarily control *volume* on an accordion.
* **B: Tika koningisa misapi nayopambapamba pona kobatela bopikiliki nayo** (Practice different fingerings to improve your dexterity) - This is good practice in general, but doesn't address the specific problem of maintaining volume.
* **C: Kobosana te tango ozali kofina bilembo sala ete loboko nayo ezala pete** (Don't rush when pressing buttons, keep your fingers relaxed) - Relaxed fingers are helpful, but again, don't directly control volume.



"
"Tango ozali kobeta accordeon , nini na kati na mae malandi ekosunga komatisa volime?","The correct answer is **C: Pression ya mukie** (Air pressure).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...okosalela eloko babengi soufflet makasi to na **vitese mingi**.""  While speed (vitesse) is mentioned, it's *in relation to* working the bellows (soufflet). The bellows create air pressure, and controlling that pressure is how you control the volume on an accordion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vitesi ebele (Slow speed):** The passage mentions speed *with* the bellows, but doesn't say slow speed controls volume.
* **B: Makasi mingi (Many buttons):** Buttons select notes/chords, not volume.
* **D: Koningisa misapi mukemuke (Relaxed finger positioning):** Finger position affects *what* notes are played, not how loud.



"
Pona nini foto ya television bandelo na yango ya suka ekatemi?,"The correct answer is **B: Na yango foto etondi na ecran mobimba** (Because the picture appears large on the screen).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Babengaka yango surbalayage. Eza mawa, ntango osolola DVD, basonge na yango pe ekokatana, pe soki osali video oyo eza na makomi ezoleka na ecran pene ya basonge, ekomonana te mobimba.""  This translates to ""They call it overscan. For example, when you play a DVD, the image is cut off, and if you play a video that is made for smaller screens on a large screen, it doesn't appear large.""  This directly relates to the picture being stretched or appearing larger than intended.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pona kosala ete maloba ekomama** (Because the speech is coming out) - The passage doesn't mention sound.
* **C: Pona kosala ete masolo ya pete esalema na lolenge misusu** (Because the small details are shown in other ways) - This isn't discussed in the text.
* **D: Pona kokata maloba oyo ezali kokomama pene na bouton** (Because pressing a button stops the speech) - Again, this relates to sound and isn't mentioned.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana , likama nini kati na mae malandi oyo moto akoki kokutana na yango tango azali kobongola filme na lolenge ya DVD?","The correct answer is **A: Foto oyo ezali komonana te na kati ya ecran mobimba** (The picture doesn't show up fully on the screen).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the problem is that when playing DVDs, the image is cut off, and doesn't fill the whole screen (""soki osali video oyo eza na makomi ezoleka na ecran pene ya basonge, ekomonana te mobimba"").  This means the picture isn't *fully* visible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kokata maloba ya kokomama ndambu:** (Speaking nonsense) - The passage describes a technical issue, not someone speaking incoherently.
* **C: Foto oyo etondi na ecran mobimba:** (The picture shows fully on the screen) - This is the *opposite* of the problem described.
* **D: Kokata bandelo:** (Cutting off parts) - While the passage mentions parts being cut off, the core problem *is* the incomplete picture, not just the act of cutting.



"
Mapinga ya Grande Bretagne ezuamaki na esika nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Bordentown**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""General John Cadwalder akomema basoda mpona kobundisa basoda ya Grande Bretange na **Bordentown**, mpona kokanga nzela basalisa bango te ata moke.""  This directly says the British troops were to be attacked at Bordentown.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Assunpink Creek** - While mentioned, it's where General Ewing *blocked* the British from crossing, not where they were stationed.
*   **B: Trenton** -  The American troops were *near* Trenton, and a later action likely took place there, but the initial British presence being targeted is in Bordentown.
*   **D: Princeton** - Princeton isn't mentioned in this passage.



"
Mokoloto ya nani ezuamaki na mokanda oyo ekomami na maboko?,"The correct answer is **A: John Dunlap**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...nsima batindaki mokanda ya ebandeli oyo mokambi ya Congres John Hancock pe sekretere Charles Thomsonatiaki batiaki maboko na **imprimerie ya John Dunlap**.""  This translates to ""...they printed the initial document with the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson signing their names at **John Dunlap's printing shop**.""

Therefore, John Dunlap's name is directly associated with the printing of the document and thus, his name would be on the copies. While others signed it, Dunlap *produced* it.



"
"Na kati ya bisika mae malandi , Dunlap broadside ekomaki wapi pona mbala ya suka?","The correct answer is **C: London**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kopi moko ekomaki na Londres na mokolo ya 10 sanza ya mwambe."" which translates to ""One copy was sent to London on November 10th.""  This directly answers the question of where a Dunlap broadside was sent for distribution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: New York** - The passage mentions it was *read* to soldiers in New York, but not where it originated for distribution.
*   **B: Dunlap’s printing shop** - This is where it was *printed*, not where it was sent for wider distribution.
*   **D: Independence Hall** - This is where it was *adopted* and initially signed, but not where a copy was sent.



"
Mapinga ya Colonel Stark ezuamaki na esika nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Na suka ya nordi, na efelo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bato ya Stark bazwaki bisika pene ya lopango na suka ya nordi ya esika ya babotoli mboka."" This directly translates to ""Stark's troops positioned themselves near the front on the north side of the babotoli area.""  And then it continues ""na efelo"" meaning ""on the slope.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Na plage na suka ya mai:** The text doesn't mention a beach or the south side.
*   **C: Na nordi est ya esanga:** While the overall conflict was near the northeast, Stark's specific positioning isn't described as being in that direction.
*   **D: Liboso ya efelo:** This refers to the distance *from* the front, not the location *of* the troops.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana , na tango nini bato ya Stark bakobisaki kimolai ya efelo na bango?","The correct answer is **A: Na tango babotoli basengaki lisalisi** (When the babotoli were preparing to defend).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Na tango mai ya makasi efungoli nzela na Ebale Mystic na ndelo ya nordi este ya esanga, bakomisaki noki bandelo na bango molai na mwa efelo ya mabanga ya mokuse na nordi oyo ezosuka na mopanzi ya mai na mwa libongo ya moke."" This translates to: ""When the river began to open towards Mystic, on the north-eastern edge of the plain, they began to fortify their position in front of the northern wooded hills that rose from the riverbank.""

This directly links the fortification (kimolai) to the babotoli preparing for a defense (lisalisi).  The other options aren't directly supported by the text as the *trigger* for the fortification.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, eleko nini na kati ya mae malandi ezalaki ya mabe koleka na mboka Chine?","The correct answer is **D: Na eleko ya bokonzi Misato**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Eleko oyo eyebana mingi eza eleko ya Bikonzi Misato oyo ezwaki mibu 60 nsima ya boyangeli ya Han na Jin."" This translates to ""This period was largely the period of the Three Kingdoms which lasted 60 years after the Han and Jin dynasties.""  The text then goes on to describe the conflicts and struggles *within* the Three Kingdoms period.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Na eleko ya bokonzi ya The Jin:** While mentioned, the text states the Three Kingdoms period *followed* the Jin dynasty, not that it was the period of greatest conflict.
* **B: Na eleko ya Bokonzi ya Xi’an:** Xi’an is a city, and while important historically, the text doesn't identify this as the period of most conflict.
* **C: Na eleko ya bokonzi ya Han:**  The text states the Three Kingdoms period came *after* the Han dynasty.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana , bosolo ezali nini na mae matali libota ya bafourmis na ngonga batambolaka kokende bisika misusu?","The correct answer is **C: Basalaka bandako oyo ebongwanaka sima ya mikolo 17** (They create tracks that are visible after 17 days).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Na ntango wana, lisanga ezalaki kosala bandako ya ango moke oyo bazalaki kobongola mikolo nyonso. Mokomoko ya mibembo to kotambola wana ezalaki kozwa pene ya mikolo 17.""  This directly translates to: ""At that time, the tracks were made by a single line that they followed every day. The duration to see the tracks when moving there was about 17 days.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Basaka bisika ya kovanda na butu** (They create foundations to hide in the ground) - While they *do* hide in the ground, the passage doesn't say this is the purpose of the tracks.
* **B: Bazali na kozanga bilei** (They are carrying eggs) - The passage mentions eggs, but not as the reason for their activity or the creation of the tracks.
* **D: Batambolaka na moi** (They travel in moisture) - The passage doesn't mention anything about moisture influencing their travel.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, maloba nini esosolisi malamu bizaleli ya bituluku ya bafourmis na ngonga batambolaka kokende bisika misusu?","The correct answer is **A: Batongaka bandako na Butu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ntango bakendaka esika mosusu, bitululu ya bafourmis batambolaka na butu mpe basalaka camp na moi mpo batambola te.""  This translates to: ""When they move to another place, the groups of ants travel in the soil and set up camp so they can't travel."" This directly indicates they *carry their eggs in the soil*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Batamboalaka mikolo 17 na kozanga kotonga bandako** - The passage mentions 17 days as the *duration of laying eggs* not travelling.
* **C: Babongolaka bandako mikolo nyonso** - The passage says they *lay* eggs every day, not *carry* them every day.
* **D: Basalelaka kaka bandako wana pona ngonga nyonso ya kotambola** - While they care for the eggs, the passage focuses on *how* they transport them (in the soil) during movement, not just their general care.



"
Nini na kati ya mae malandi ekokoba atasoki ba molongo ezali?,"The correct answer is **A: Bileko endogene**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...na ndenge bato basalaka makambo etalelaka mbala mingi na **bileko ebengami endogènes**..."" (and how people experience things repeatedly with **internal/endogenous rhythms**...).  The question asks what allows sequences to be disrupted, and the passage identifies endogenous rhythms as the source of these sequences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ritme ya ngonga na ngonga (Irregular rhythm):** While rhythms *can* be irregular, the passage doesn't suggest irregularity is the basis of sequences or what can disrupt them.
* **C: Lolenge ya nzoto kosala mosala to kokola (The ability to do work or stop):** This is related to energy and isn't directly connected to the internal rhythms discussed.
* **D: Ba rythmes oyo etosami (Rhythms that are observed):** Observing rhythms doesn't explain *what* allows sequences to be disrupted. It's the underlying mechanism (endogenous rhythms) that's key.



"
Maloba nini elimboli malamu bato oyo bazali komonisa bilembo ya kolandana?,"The correct answer is **D: Polymorphic**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Soki bato mingi bamonisi lolenge mingi ekeseni ya ezaleli moko bablobaka bazali polymorphes.""  This translates to: ""If many individuals show many different traits within a single population, they are called polymorphic.""
* **The question asks:** Which term describes individuals exhibiting variation in traits?
* **Polymorphic** directly means having multiple forms or variations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Monomorphic:** The passage defines this as the *opposite* - when everyone looks the same.
* **B: Organisms:** This is a general term for living things and doesn't relate to trait variation.
* **C: Bikelamu:** This translates to ""population"" and is the context, not the answer to what describes variation.



"
Maloba nini na mae malandi ekokani na ba organes oyo evandi na esika songolo pakala?,"The correct answer is **D: Polymorphic**.

Here's why:

* **The passage defines Polymorphism** as the presence of multiple forms of a trait within a population.  The question asks about variation in organs (traits) within a population. Therefore, polymorphic is the most fitting term.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Monomorphic:** This refers to a population where *everyone* has the same trait, which is the *opposite* of what the question is asking about (variation).
* **B: Bato (People):** While the passage discusses populations of people, the question is about the *variation* within those populations, not people themselves.
* **C: Bikelamu (Characteristic/Trait):** This is a general term but doesn't specifically address the *multiple forms* of a trait within a population.



"
Nini na mae malandi ekoki te kozala Bozalisi ya nature ?,"The correct answer is **D: Mbisi**.

Here's why:

The passage describes poaching activities – killing animals (like elephants and rhinoceroses – hinted at by ""banyama ya zamba"" and the references to ivory/horns), taking their photos, and disrupting ecosystems.  ""Mbisi"" (killing) is the core action being described as a negative consequence of the poaching.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kotala mai:** ""Kotala mai"" (cutting trees) is mentioned, but isn't the *primary* harmful act described in relation to the poaching.
*   **B: Kokanga ba foto ya ba fololo ya zamba:** Taking photos of wild animals is mentioned, but it's a *part* of the illegal activity, not the activity itself. It’s done *after* the poaching.
*   **C: Kokende kotala Misee ya sience:**  ""Conducting scientific research"" is completely absent from the passage and would be the opposite of harmful poaching.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi ezali motuya pona lolenge ya transport?","The correct answer is **B: Mituka ya bato**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the transport system (navette) relies on the vehicles of the people using it (""ebongiseli ya transport oyo esalemaki na mituka ya bato bango moko""). The whole problem stems from the large number of cars used, contributing to carbon emissions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bisika ya kosala mosala** (Workplace needs) - While mentioned, it's the *result* of the transport issue, not the underlying cause.
* **C: Biosphere ya kofanda esika moko** (Single environmental sphere) - This is a consequence *of* the transport, not the reason for the issue.
* **D: Lolenge ya bato kokola** (People's routines) -  This is too broad. The issue isn't routines themselves, but *how* people are commuting.



Therefore, the core issue driving the problem described in the text is the reliance on individual vehicles (""mituka ya bato"")."
Biteni oyo ezalaka nzinganzinga ya nucleus ezali na courant ya lolenge nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Ya malamu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Baproton ezalaka na courant ya malamu kasi ba neutron ezalaka te na courant."" (Protons have a positive charge, but neutrons have no charge.)  Since protons are *in* the nucleus, and they have a positive charge, the nucleus contains positive charge.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Courant moko te** - Incorrect, because protons *do* have a charge.
* **C: Courant ya mabe** - Incorrect, electrons have a negative charge, not the nucleus.
* **D: Courant ya malamu mpe ya mabe** - Incorrect, while electrons orbit the nucleus and have a negative charge, the nucleus itself only contains positively charged protons (and neutral neutrons).



"
Nucleus ezalaka na biteni boni?,"The correct answer is **A: BaProtons na baNeutrons**.

The text explicitly states: ""Noyau ezalaka na biteni mibale - baneutron na baproton."" (The nucleus consists of two types of particles - neutrons and protons).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: BaNeutrons na BaElectrons** - Electrons orbit the nucleus, they aren't *in* the nucleus.
* **C: BaElectrons na BaProtons** -  Electrons orbit, protons are inside.
* **D: BaProntons, BaNeutrons na BaElectrons** - Electrons are not part of the nucleus.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini ezali ndakisa ya botangi oyo ezali ya mitango binaire?","The correct answer is **A: 1010**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that a binary code consists of only two symbols: 0 and 1.  

* **A: 1010** is the only option that *exclusively* uses 0 and 1.
* **B: 12001** contains the digit '2', which is not a valid binary digit.
* **C: 10010** is also a valid binary code, but it's not the best answer since the question is asking for *an* example of a binary code.
* **D: 110101** is also a valid binary code, but less simple than A and C.

Therefore, **A** is the clearest and most direct example of a binary code based on the provided text."
Kombo mosusu ya mitango ezalaka nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba bites**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explains that binary digits (bits) are the fundamental units used by computers.** It directly contrasts ""mintango ya binaire"" (binary digits) with ""bits"" as another term for the same thing.
* **""Ba bites""** is the plural form of ""bite"" which is the equivalent of ""bits"" in Lingala.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mitango:** This is a general term for ""numbers"" or ""amounts"" and isn't specific to computer science.
* **C: Elobeli ya bato ya Ordiantere:** This translates to ""computer language"" – while related, it's not a *type* of digit like bits are.
* **D: Ezaleli:** This translates to ""existence"" or ""being"" and has nothing to do with computer science.



"
Nini na mae malandi ezali te kati ya litomba pona moyekoli kokoma na internet ?,"The correct answer is **D: Komatisa mposa ya koyekola** (Limiting the opportunity to learn).

Here's why:

The text states that blogs ""ezopusa bana-kelasi na koyeba makambo mingi ya mokili oyo bafandi"" (help students see many things about the world they are learning) and that using blogs ""ekoki kosalisa bana-kelasi na kolandela makambo malamu pe kopesa makanisi"" (can help students follow good things and provide information).  However, it *also* says that without proper guidance, blogs can lead to students ""kozala mayele mpe bwania"" (being careless and foolish).

This implies a risk: **without careful monitoring and education, blogs can hinder the learning process rather than enhance it.**  The text highlights the importance of responsible internet use and avoiding misinformation.  Therefore, a drawback is limiting the opportunity to learn if blogs are used carelessly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Komatisa lolenge ya koloba mpe lolenge ya kokoma** (Limiting the ability to speak and write) - The text actually suggests blogs *improve* these skills.
* **B: Kokitisa kotongama na baninga** (Causing conflict with peers) - The text doesn't mention conflict with peers.
* **C: Kozala na boyebi ebele pona mae matali mokili oyo bazali kofanda** (Being easily distracted by things they are learning about) - While distraction is a potential issue with *any* technology, the text focuses on the potential for *misinformation* and careless behavior, not just distraction.



"
Na mae matali kokoma na internet nini elobami kotinda bayekoli pona komatisa lolenge na bango ya kokoma?,"The correct answer is **A: Kolobelela mbala na mbala biloko kouta na internet** (Checking things repeatedly that come out on the internet).

Here's why:

The passage states that blogs ""ezopusa bana-kelasi na koyeba makambo mingi ya mokili oyo bafandi"" (help students see many things about the world they are learning about) and that using blogs well ""ekoki kosalisa bana-kelasi na kolandela makambo malamu pe kopesa makanisi; soki bazopesa biyano noki na Internet, bana-kelasi bakoki kobongisa bisika na bango na oyo etali kokoma mpe kolakisa makoki na bango na makambo ya sikisiki"" (can help students follow good things and provide information; if they receive good information on the Internet, students can strengthen their understanding of what they are learning and show their abilities in various things).  This emphasizes the importance of *verifying* information found online, essentially checking things repeatedly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mposa ya koboya kotongama:** (The desire to be afraid) - The passage doesn't mention fear or avoidance.
* **C: Kosala ete bato oyo batangaka biloko na bango bakoma kotanga:** (Making those who post things come back) - This focuses on the *creators* of content, not the students learning.
* **D: Mposa ya kosala elongo na basusu:** (The desire to learn from others) - While learning from others is a benefit of the internet, the passage specifically highlights the need for verification, not just accepting information.



"
Nini na kati ya mae malandi ezali te litomba ya kosolola asynkrone pona bayekoli? ,"The correct answer is **A: Kosalela internet neti lisungi** (Using the internet as a tool).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Kosalela Internet mpe site internet ya mokili mobimba esalisaka bayekoli na kozwa basango ntango nyonso."" (Using the Internet and mobile websites allows students to access content at any time.) This directly connects the internet to asynchronous learning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kokutana na bakambi moko na moko mikolo nyonso** (Meeting with teachers one-on-one every day) - This describes synchronous learning, not asynchronous.
* **C: Ba ngonga malamu ya kosala musala** (Good skills in doing work) - While helpful, this isn't *essential* for asynchronous learning to function.
* **D: Kobatela vitesi** (Adjusting speed) - The passage mentions adjusting speed *within* the asynchronous environment, but it's not the tool *enabling* asynchronous learning.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, eteni nini ya kosolola asynkrone ezali pete te pona bayekoli?","The correct answer is **A: Vitesi ya boyekoli (The speed of learning)**.

Here's why:

The text states that asynchronous learning *allows students to work at their own pace and maintain a faster pace than the class*. This directly addresses the speed at which students learn.  The other options are mentioned in the text, but aren't the *benefit* of asynchronous learning that the passage highlights as particularly important.

* **B: Ba ngonga ya kosala mosala (Work obligations)** - The text mentions it has a single ability to accommodate work schedules, but it doesn't frame this as the primary benefit.
* **C: Bisaleli ya ba ndingisa (Accessibility of resources)** - The text mentions Internet access to resources, but again, this isn't the core advantage highlighted.
* **D: Bosaleli internet (Internet access)** - Similar to C, internet access is a *tool* for asynchronous learning, not the benefit itself.



"
Na maloba wana nini etangemi te lokola eloko oyo moto akoki kokokanisa yango na ba ndako ya medieval ya kala?,"The correct answer is **C: Chevalerie**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses knights, tournaments (joutes), and Arthurian legends.** These are all core elements of *chevalerie* – the medieval code of conduct for knights, encompassing ideals of honor, courage, and chivalry.  The passage describes the lifestyle and activities of knights in medieval castles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mabulu ya molili (Walls of fire):** While castles had defenses, the passage doesn't focus on fire as a defensive element.
* **B: Ba joutes (Jousts):** Jousts are *part* of the knightly culture, but they aren't the overarching theme. They're an activity *within* chevalerie.
* **D: Bapunda (Legends):**  Arthurian legends are mentioned, but ""legends"" is too broad. The passage is describing the *reality* of knightly life, not just the stories about it.



Therefore, **Chevalerie (C)** best encompasses the overall subject matter of the passage."
Na maloba wana nini na mae malandi epatami te lokola solo to mongongo oyo ekoki kondimama kozala bobebi ya ndako?,"The correct answer is **A: Bitumba**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a medieval castle with various features including ""bitumba"" (towers) which are described as being part of the defensive structure alongside walls and a donjon. The question asks what *within the description* wouldn't be expected to be found in a castle.  Towers (bitumba) are a standard feature of castles, unlike a solo or a mushroom.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Somo (Darkness)** - Darkness would be *inside* a castle, it's not a physical structure.
* **C: Bafeti (Fetes/Feasts)** - Feasts happened *in* castles, they weren't part of the structure itself.
* **D: Basapatu (Shoes)** - Shoes would be worn *by* people in the castle, but aren't a part of the castle itself.



"
Nini na mae malandi elimboli malamu ndako ya Kirby Muxloe?,"The correct answer is **B: Na ngonga ya kotonga esengaki kokembisama mukie mpo kimia ezalaki na mboka na ngonga wana**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Na mibu 1480, ntango babandaki kotonga yango na Lord Hastings, mboka ezalaki na mwa kimia mpe ezalaki kosenga kaka kobatela yango na mwa bituluku ya mike ya miyibi oyo bazalaki koya."" (In the 1480s, when they began to build it for Lord Hastings, the land was in a chemical state and was only suitable for building with small, poor-quality materials that they had.)

This directly explains that the building's construction was affected by the land's condition (being in a chemical state).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bifelo ya ndako esengamaki na Lord Hastings:** While Lord Hastings commissioned the building, the passage doesn't say his *plans* made the building notable. It's the land itself.
* **C: Botongi ya ndako ekokanaki te na tango ya kala:** The passage indicates building *did* begin in the past.
* **D: Etongamaki pona kotelemela bitumba ya molai mpe makasi:** While the passage mentions poor-quality materials, it doesn't say the building was *designed* to accommodate them – it was a constraint imposed by the land.



"
Lolenge nini elakisi ete botongi ya ndako Kirby Muxloe ezalaki ya bokeseni na tango ya kala oyo elobami na maloba wana?,"The correct answer is **D: Bifelo mikiemikie**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*bifelo na yango ya mike elingaki kobika te soki babundisaki yango na ntango molai.*"" This translates to ""...small defenses that couldn't be broken if they surrounded it at the right time."" This directly indicates the castle's strength came from its difficult-to-breach defenses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maninisa minene:** While the castle *was* large, the passage focuses on its defensive qualities, not just its size.
*   **B: Fondation etongamaki pona kotelemela bitumba:** The passage doesn't mention the foundation being specifically designed to support towers.
*   **C: Ekembisamaki mukie kokesana na bandako misusu:** The passage doesn't state the castle was built to compete with other castles.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi ekoki kozala litomba monene pona atlete oyo azali kolengela saison?","The correct answer is **D: Kosala momesano na salle de sport pona kokembisa eteni ya likolo ya nzoto.** (Do training in the gym to strengthen core muscles.)

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of core strength (""kokanga motema"") for maintaining good form and preventing injury, especially during long-distance running and cross-country.**  It states that a runner needs to maintain core strength ""na makama nyonso"" (at all times).
* **Option D directly addresses this need by suggesting gym training to build core muscle strength.**

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Kopota mwa mbangu ya kokima na mboka na tango ya molunge (Participate in a race in the country during a good time):** While racing is part of training, the passage focuses on *preparation* for those races, specifically strengthening the core.
* **B: Kosala makasi pona komatisa vitesi na ngonga ya momesano to exercise (Practice to improve speed during training or exercise):** Speed is important, but the passage prioritizes *form* and injury prevention through core strength.
* **C: Kokokisa limite ya minute misato (Set a limit of six minutes):** This refers to a specific time in the passage (running a kilometer in six minutes), but it's presented as an example of a challenge, not a primary training goal.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini ezali ya motuya mingi pona atlete ya malamu ya half-mile?","The correct answer is **C: Kosilisa course nase ya minite mibale**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ya solo, katikati ya kilometele mpona kelasi ya liboso, moto oyo akoki kolonga miniti mibale, asengeli kozala na vitese ya malamu, kasi asengeli kolona ezaleli ya kokanga motema na makama nyonso."" This translates to: ""Solo, in the middle of the race for the best class, a runner can take several minutes, they must be at a good pace, but they must maintain the ability to push their heart rate at all times.""  This emphasizes the importance of *pacing* to manage the effort over those minutes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kopota mwa mbangu ya cross-country na eleko ya malili:** While mentioned, this is about overall training, not a specific challenge within the half-mile race.
*   **B: Kokolisa bopikiliki na esika ya mbangu:** This doesn't directly relate to what's important for a good half-mile runner according to the passage.
*   **D: Kokolisa mbangu na esika ya bopikiliki:** Similar to B, this isn't the main point emphasized in the text.



"
"Pona atlete , na mae malandi nini ekoki te kozuama kaka na nzela ya koliya malamu?","The correct answer is **C: Mosala ya malamu mingi** (Excessive training).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly states:** ""...ekoki kozala na bopusi mingi na bolamu ya ba athlete mingi ya bilenge."" which translates to ""...can cause a lot of problems in the health of many young athletes.""  It then goes on to describe how overtraining can lead to injury and hinder performance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mosala ya malamu (Training):**  Training *itself* isn't the problem, it's *excessive* training.
* **B: Esengo ya mingi (Too much competition):** While competition can be stressful, the passage focuses on the physical toll of training.
* **D: Kozala malamu na lolenge nyonso (Being injured in all situations):** The passage discusses *preventing* injury through proper training, not being constantly injured.



Therefore, **C** accurately reflects the core message of the passage: too much training is detrimental to athletes' health and performance."
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi toli nini oyo epesameli te na baatletes ya mikie mpona kozua esengo na spor na bango?","The correct answer is **A: Komesana koliya malamu** (To be able to endure pain).

Here's why:

The passage (P) states the ability to endure pain (""ekoki te mpona kosalisa malamu"") is a key characteristic, even if it comes with significant physical consequences for athletes. It goes on to explain how pushing through pain and facing challenges contributes to success and improvement. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kosala mosala malamu mingi ngonga nyonso** (To do a lot of difficult work all the time) - While hard work is important, the passage *specifically* emphasizes pain tolerance.
* **C: Kobatela mai na kati ya nzoto ngonga nyonso** (To fight hard in the middle of the struggle all the time) - This is related, but doesn't capture the core idea of *withstanding* the pain itself.
* **D: Kozala na makasi na nzoto na ngonga nyonso** (To be strong in struggle all the time) - Strength is helpful, but the passage focuses on being able to *tolerate* the discomfort that accompanies struggle.



Therefore, **A** best reflects the main point about what allows athletes to achieve success despite suffering."
"Kolanda maloba wana, pona nini atlete ya course ya distance ndambu akoki kosomba esaleli ya talo mingi?","The correct answer is **C: Ekomatisa lolenge naye ya kosala mosala**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) states:** ""...mingi ekosalisa moke to mingi te na mosala"" (often results in one or many mistakes in performance) and ""...Baathlètes bakoki kokanisa balingaka eloko moko ata soki eza te na matomba ya solo"" (Athletes can push their limits even if it's not in their training plan). This suggests an athlete might attempt a challenging goal *despite* not being fully prepared.  They are *motivated* to try.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ezali oyo alingi** (It's what they want) - This doesn't explain *why* they would attempt a difficult goal. Wanting something doesn't explain the endurance aspect.
* **B: Emonisi litomba na yango** (They ignore their training) - The passage doesn't say they *ignore* training, only that they might attempt something *outside* of their planned training.
* **D: Makambo ebele ya lokuta elobamaka pona bisaleli ya talo mukie** (Early signs of fatigue affect performance) - While fatigue is a factor in endurance events, the passage focuses on the *willingness* to push limits, not the consequences of fatigue.



Therefore, **C** best reflects the idea that an athlete is driven to attempt a long run despite not being fully prepared, demonstrating a strong will to work hard (""ekomatisisa lolenge naye ya kosala mosala"")."
"Kolanda maloba wana, course ya distance ndambu esengi nini?","The correct answer is **A: Bisaleli ebele** (Beginner runner).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a demi-fond (middle-distance race) as not requiring a lot of physical strength, but needing good technique and endurance.** It emphasizes that athletes can participate even without significant muscle mass. This aligns perfectly with a beginner runner who might not be strong but can build endurance and technique.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kozala mutu oyo abandaki kokima mbangu kala** (Someone who used to run a lot) - The passage doesn't focus on past experience, but on the requirements for *currently* running a demi-fond.
* **C: Bisaleli mukie** (Experienced runner) - The passage explicitly states it doesn't require a lot of strength, which is usually associated with experienced runners.
* **D: Mbongo ebele** (Good swimmer) - This is irrelevant to the context of a running race.

**Therefore, the passage suggests that a demi-fond is accessible even to those who are new to running – a beginner runner.**



"
Nani amonaki résonance magnétique nucléaire liboso? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch and Purcell**.

The text states: ""Ekzame IRM esalemaka na kolanda likambo moko ya physique oyo babengaka résonance magnétique nucléaire (RMN), oyo babimisaki na mibu 1930 na **Felix Bloch (oyo asalaka na Université ya Stanford) pe Edward Purcell (ya Université ya Harvard)**."" 

This translates to: ""The IRM exam is based on a physics phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by **Felix Bloch (from Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University)**.""

While Damadian made important contributions *later* in applying NMR to medical imaging, he didn't *discover* NMR itself."
Na mbula nini diplome ya yambo epesamaki pona bilili na résonance magnétique ? ,"The correct answer is **D: Mbula 1970**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Na mbula 1970, Raymond Damadian, monganga mpe molukiluki ya makambo ya siansi, amonaki bantina ya kosalela bilili na résonance magnétique mpona koyeba maladi. Mibu minei na nsima, bapesaki diplome, oyo ezalaki diplome ya liboso oyo bapesaki na makambo ya IRM."" 

This directly translates to: ""In the 1970s, Dr. Damadian discovered a way to use magnetic resonance to detect disease. Soon after, diplomas were awarded, which was the first diploma awarded in the field of MRI.""

Therefore, the first diplomas related to magnetic resonance imaging were awarded in the 1970s.



"
"Kolanada maloba wana, esengeli na bato kososola eloko nini makasi mingi pona kolimbola bizaleli ya komonana ya bato misusu?","The correct answer is **B: Ntina**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) emphasizes the importance of understanding what others can see, feel, compare, judge, or want. It specifically highlights that understanding the *perspectives* (or viewpoints) of others is crucial.  ""Ntina"" in Lingala directly translates to ""perspective"" or ""point of view.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mposa (strength):** While strength can be helpful, it's not the central idea of the passage.
* **C: Kondima (to judge):** The passage mentions judging, but it's presented as *one* of the things others can do, not the key to understanding them.
* **D: Komona (to see):** Seeing is mentioned, but the passage goes beyond just seeing to understanding *why* someone sees things the way they do - their perspective.



Therefore, understanding ""ntina"" (perspective) is most vital for interpreting the actions and intentions of others, as described in the passage."
"Kolanda maloba wana, kososola ntina esungaka bato pona kosala nini?","The correct answer is **D: Kotanga makanisi ya basusu (Creating suspicions among people)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) is *about* creating suspicions.** It describes how observing others' actions can lead to distrust and accusations (""koyeba makanisi ya basusu""). The example given – someone repairing a car being suspected of stealing it – perfectly illustrates this.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Kosilisa kozanga kondima na mae matali bizaleli ya komonana (To encourage people to confide in those close to them):** The passage is about the *opposite* of trust; it's about suspicion.
    * **B: Kolobela ba mposa (To tell lies):** While suspicion *can* lead to lies, the core issue discussed is the generation of the suspicion itself, not the lying.
    * **C: Kotala bato misusu kozanga ko juger bango (To allow others to judge them):** The passage focuses on *making* judgments (suspicions) rather than allowing others to judge.



Therefore, the passage primarily discusses the act of *generating suspicion* among people."
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini kati ya mae malandi na kimukuse ekokani na litomba monene ya AI?","The correct answer is **A: Kolengela (Learning)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that AI ""elandelaka bizaleli, mayele pe ndenge mashine emesanaka"" (learns from experience, patterns, and how machines interact).  It then goes on to describe AI's abilities to ""kobongisa makambo bato bakutanaka na yango na bomoi"" (understand things people encounter in life) – all of which are based on *learning*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bososoli mongongo (Continuous improvement):** While AI *can* lead to continuous improvement, the core fundamental ability described in the passage is the initial *learning* process.
* **C: Kolengela ntango (Time management):** The passage doesn't focus on time management.
* **D: Bosali mosala na mashine yemoko (Performing work on a single machine):**  The passage mentions AI operating on ""ordinatere mingi"" (many computers) and in various applications, so it's not limited to a single machine.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi oyo elandana mingi na AI?","The correct answer is **B: Kobongisa mpe kolengela ba ngonga ya mosala** (Improving and automating work tasks).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Bolukiluki na AI esengaka kosala bamashine mpona kosala mosala yango oyo esengaka ezala na mayele."" (Research in AI aims to make machines do the work that needs to be done by humans).  It further lists examples like automating tasks, analyzing data, and assisting with decision making - all related to improving and automating work.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Service client** (Customer service) - While AI *can* be used for customer service, the passage doesn't focus on this.
* **C: Siance fiction** (Science fiction) - The passage describes real-world applications of AI, not fictional ones.
* **D: Bososoli ya makomi ya maboko** (Prosthetics) - While the passage mentions understanding gestures, it's just one example within the broader scope of AI's capabilities and isn't the central theme.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi ezalaka makasi ya moto oyo azalaka na ndenge ya kokanisa","The correct answer is **A: Kopona biyano ebele ya malamu na kati ya likambo songolo pakala.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes understanding the connections and relationships between many elements to explain events.**  It mentions speed, sequence, complexity, and observing individual things to relate them to past events. This all points to being able to *form a clear understanding within a situation* –  ""kopona biyano ebele ya malamu na kati ya likambo songolo pakala"" translates to ""to have a clear and accurate understanding within a situation.""

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Kosalela balolenge ebele na kati ya likambo (Using references easily within a situation):** While references are mentioned (using past events), the focus isn't *just* on referencing, but on understanding the connections *between* everything.
* **C: Kozua ngonga oyo esengeli pona kozua eyano na likambo (Finding the point needed to find understanding in a situation):**  The passage describes a holistic understanding, not just pinpointing one crucial point.
* **D: Lolenge ya kobomba makambo na kati ya mayele (The ability to manipulate things within systems):** While the passage mentions the *results* of this understanding (being able to predict, cause, and experiment), it's not the core ability itself. The core ability is the *understanding* first, then the manipulation follows.



Therefore, option A best captures the essence of the described type of thinking – a deep and accurate comprehension of the situation."
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi endimami te kotalela makasi ndenge ya kokanisa?","The correct answer is **A: Kososola ete eyano ya malamu ezali kaka moko** (To assume that a good outcome is only one).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Likambo eleki ntina na makanisi oyo eza: eyano ya solo eza kaka moko."" (The problem with those approaches is: a good outcome is only one.) This highlights the limitation of the described method – it only allows for one possible successful result.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kozua ngonga oyo esengeli** (To find the necessary angle) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Kososola bosolo** (To assume simplicity) - While the passage talks about efficiency, it doesn't specifically mention assuming simplicity as a flaw.
* **D: Kosangisa ba nsango** (To combine efforts) - The passage actually references using past experiences to combine efforts *as a contrast* to the flawed method it describes.



Therefore, option A directly reflects the issue with the method outlined in the text."
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi ekoki te kondimama lokola micro-expresion?","The correct answer is **A: Kotala pembeni na ngonga ya kosolola** (Turning away from direct gaze).

Here's why:

The passage discusses people having difficulty *reading* others, particularly subtle cues. Oliver Sacks points out how people with such difficulties might perceive intention or feeling in animals or inanimate objects.  Micro-expressions are fleeting facial expressions that reveal true emotions even when someone is trying to hide them.  

* **Turning away from direct gaze** is a common subconscious behavior when someone is uncomfortable, lying, or trying to conceal something.  Someone struggling to read social cues might miss this subtle shift in attention.  They might not pick up on the fact that someone avoiding eye contact is signaling something.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kozipazipa miso (To shiver)** - While shivering can be a physical response to emotion, it's not a micro-expression and isn't directly related to failing to read social cues.
* **C: Kobetabeta miso mbangu mbangu (To stammer)** - Stammering is a speech impediment, not a facial expression or subtle cue.
* **D: Komatisa mosapi munene ya loboko likolo (To make a large hand gesture)** -  Large gestures are *overt* expressions, the opposite of the subtle micro-expressions that someone struggling with social cues would miss.



"
Na maloba ya bolimboli micro-expresion mae malandi nini ezali solo te?,"The correct answer is **C: Maloba mpe bizaleli ya elongi esosolami malamu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the ability to *detect deception* (telling if someone is lying).** It mentions micro-expressions, the idea that people can reveal their true feelings even when trying to hide them, and Oliver Sacks' work on how people with certain conditions can perceive truth despite language.
* **Option C** directly relates to this:  ""Maloba"" (speech) and ""bizaleli ya elongi"" (emotional state/intentions) being revealed through ""malamu"" (deception/lying).  This is the central theme of the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kosala enregistrement ya video emema makambo mingi te** (Recording video doesn't reveal much) - This is a statement *about* the recordings, not what micro-expressions reveal. The passage says recordings *can* reveal a lot.
* **B: Bolimboli ya malamu ekoki komonisa lokuta** (Deception can show sadness) - While deception *can* be linked to emotions, it doesn't capture the core idea of detecting underlying truth.
* **D: Ekoki kosalisa komeka bosolo** (It can cause empathy) -  Empathy isn't the focus of the passage; it's about discerning truthfulness.



"
Na mae malandi nini ekomaki ya motuya mingi kouta na Renaissance? ,"The correct answer is **A: Mayele ya kokanisa (The desire to know)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""...mayele ya kokanisa maloba ekomaki ntina mingi koleka."" (The desire to know things had great importance.)  It connects this desire to the flourishing of knowledge and the rediscovery of ancient texts.
* **Renaissance Meaning:** The Renaissance was fundamentally driven by a renewed interest in classical learning, art, and philosophy – a powerful *desire to know* and understand the world.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Boyebi ya kobalukabaluka (The desire to change):** While change happened *because* of the Renaissance, the core driving force wasn't simply wanting change, but wanting *knowledge*.
* **C: Mayele ya kokanisa makomi (The desire to know places):** Exploration was a part of the Renaissance, but it wasn’t the central driving force behind the intellectual and artistic rebirth.
* **D: Bozui bansango (Political power):** While political factors played a role, they weren’t the *primary* reason for the flourishing of knowledge during the Renaissance.



"
"Kolanda boyei ya kobotama lisusu , eloko nini na mae malandi ezuamaki lisusu na litomba mingi te?","The correct answer is **A: Mayele ya kokanisa** (The desire to share information/communicate).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Na mokuse, kobotama lisusu esalaki mbongwana monene na lolenge ya koyekola mpe ya kopanza boyebi."" (In the end, the return was a great desire in the realm of learning and sharing knowledge.)
* **The question asks:** What desire caused people to return, and what was it that motivated them to overcome many difficulties?
* **Mayele ya kokanisa** directly aligns with the passage's explanation of the driving force behind the return – the desire to learn and *share* (communicate) knowledge.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bozui boyebi:** (Searching for truth) While related, the passage emphasizes *sharing* what is found, not just the search itself.
* **C: Mayele ya kokanisa makomi:** (Desire to connect with ancestors)  The passage doesn't focus on ancestral connection.
* **D: Bopanzi ya bansango:** (Strength of the community) While community support is important, it's not the primary *desire* that drives the return.



"
Na mae malandi nini emonisi te ntina ya kosalela internet pona bokobi ya ba relations ?,"The correct answer is **D: Kokutana na bato ya sika** (Meeting people/connecting with others).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""koyekola” pe “kosangana na basusu” elendisaka mingi na kosalela internt"" which translates to ""looking [for things] and 'connecting with others' are major reasons for using the internet.""
* The passage also mentions ""komipesa na yo moko"" and ""kokoba boyokani"" (forming relationships) as part of internet use motivations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bosali mombongo:** (General information) While the internet *provides* general information, the passage focuses on *social* reasons for use.
* **B: Kosolola na libota ngonga nyonso:** (Solving all problems) The internet doesn't solve all problems, and this isn't the focus of the text.
* **C: Kosala bulukiluki pona mibembo:** (Doing research for projects) Research isn't specifically mentioned as a primary social motivation.



"
Na mae malandi nini emonisi te ntina ya kosalela internet pona makambo ya moto yemoko?,"The correct answer is **A: Kotala lolenge ya kosala eloko** (Being able to do things/accomplish tasks).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""koyekola” pe “kosangana na basusu” elendisaka mingi na kosalela internt (James et al., 1995)."" This translates to ""achieving things"" and ""interacting with others"" are major motivators for internet use.  This aligns directly with being able to *do* things.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kotia masolo ya internet na ecran:** (Seeing pictures on the internet) - While viewing images is *part* of internet use, the passage doesn't highlight it as a primary motivator.
* **C: Kosala bolukiluki ya bakisi pona kolongono ya nzoto:** (Doing research for personal health) - This is a specific use case, not a general motivation.
* **D: Koyeba kosalela mbongo:** (Seeing people spend money) - The passage discusses motivations *for using* the internet, not observing financial transactions.



"
Na ngonga nini Erope ya Est etikaki kolanda makasi bizaleli ya basusu mpe kobanda kosala makambo lolenge na yango moko?,"The correct answer is **B: Na ngonga ya Byzantine**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Na ebandeli elamba ezalaki kolanda mingi bizaleli ya bato ya Byzantine ya este."" This translates to ""Initially, the East heavily influenced the works of the Byzantines.""  The text then explains that Western Europe was *behind* the East (Byzantine influence) by 25-30 years.  Therefore, the East (specifically the Byzantines) is the reason Western Europe initially followed their artistic style.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na ngonga ya moyen Age** - While the period *is* the Middle Ages, this doesn't explain *why* Eastern Europe had influence.
*   **C: Mbula 25 sima ya moyen age** - This refers to the *delay* in Western Europe's development, not the initial influence.
*   **D: Na ekeke to siècle ya 11** - This specifies a time period, but doesn’t explain the source of influence.



"
Kosalela babutons pona kokanga bilamba ezalaki eyano kouta wapi? ,"The correct answer is **C: The Crusades**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...nsima ya bitumba babengi croisades, bato babandaki kosalela baboutons mpona kokanga bilamba.""  This directly translates to ""after the many crusades, people began to use buttons to build houses.""  Therefore, the use of buttons for building (and thus, the practice itself) originated with the Crusades.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na tango ya Gothic** - While the passage discusses Gothic architecture, it says the *use of buttons* for building started *after* the Crusades, not during the Gothic period itself.
*   **B: Na ekeke ya Byzantine** - The passage mentions Byzantine influence at the *beginning* of the Gothic period, but doesn't connect them to the use of buttons for building.
*   **D: Ngonga ya moyen age** - ""Ngonga ya moyen age"" (the era of the Middle Ages) is too broad. The passage specifies the Crusades as the origin point.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini ezuami kozala eyano pona ngonga molai na mae matali mikakatano ya esika tofandaka?","The correct answer is **C: Kososola ba ntina ya ba problemes (Solving the root causes of problems)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) emphasizes understanding *where* problems come from (""esika tofandaka makambo malamu"") and *why* they happen (""ndenge bapesaka kisi ya maladi"").** It then stresses the importance of not just addressing symptoms (""solution ya ntango moke"") but *going to the source* (""koluka esika makambo euti, pe kolongola yango"").
* **Option C directly reflects this idea of addressing the underlying causes.**

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Kotika bomoi ya mindondo (Living a long life):** While the passage mentions the benefits of science and technology extending lifespan, it's not the *central* message about responding to problems.
* **B: Activisme to kmisusu lolenge ya kobika (Activism or fighting for change):**  The passage doesn't specifically call for activism, though it implies a need for proactive effort.  It's more about understanding and fixing the root cause.
* **D: Kokoma moninga ya Makita pona esika tofandaka (Seeking advice from experts for the area in question):** While experts are valuable, the passage focuses on *doing* the work of understanding the source of problems, not just seeking advice.



Therefore, **C** best encapsulates the core message of the passage about addressing problems at their origin."
"Kolanda maloba wana, kati ya biyano elandi eyano nini ekoki te kondimama lokola eyano pona ngonga mokuse na mikakatano ya esika tofandaka?","The correct answer is **B: Kolongola ebandeli ya mikakatano** (Addressing the root causes of problems).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of not just treating symptoms (""bapesaka kisi ya maladi mbala mingi kaka na kolanda bilembo"" - they often just treat the symptoms) but finding and fixing the *source* of the problems (""soki tolingi kaka te solution ya ntango moke, wana tosengeli koluka esika makambo euti, pe kolongola yango"" - if you don't find a long-term solution, you need to look at where things originate and fix it).**

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Kosala activisme (Doing activism)** – While activism *can* be part of the solution, it doesn’t inherently address the root causes. It’s a *method*, not the solution itself.
* **C: Kolobela mae matali lolenge ya kobika bomoi ya mindondo (Adopting ways to extend lifespan)** – This focuses on coping with the consequences of the problems, not preventing them. It's treating the symptoms.
* **D: Kobika malamu na esika tofandaka (Living well in difficult places)** –  Similar to C, this is adaptation, not a solution to the underlying issues.

Therefore, **kolongola ebandeli ya mikakatano** directly aligns with the passage's core message about finding and fixing the origins of problems for lasting improvement.



"
Na Mboka nini bitumba ebandaki liboso na Erope oyo likambo ya makasi ezalaki kowela kibokonzi koleka makambo ya mangomba ?,"The correct answer is **D: Espagne**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Bitumba ya kokitana ya **Espagne** ezalaki bitumba ya liboso oyo likambo bazalaki kowela ezalaki kokabola bokonzi.""  This translates to: ""The fleets of **Spain** were the first fleets that the conflict was about to break out concerning.""

Therefore, the passage identifies Spain as the nation whose fleets were central to the conflict's beginning.



"
Etumba nini tango mosusu ezuamaka lokola “etumba ya mangomba” ya suka?,"The correct answer is **A: Etumba ya mbula tuku zomi na misato** (The army of the United States of America).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bitumba ya Mibu Tuku Misato ezalaki bitumba ya suka oyo babengaki ya losambo."" This translates to ""The army of the United States was the army that was feared for its strength."" 

Therefore, the army of the United States is referred to as the ""etumba ya mangomba"" (army of power/strength) in this context.



"
Na mae malandi eteni nini ya Lingomba Katolike ezalaki kotalema te?,"The correct answer is **C: Bolembisi ya kibokonzi na Lingomba** (The abuse of power within the Church).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Moko ya malako ya ntina mingi ya Boklisto eza tete basengeli kosalela bozwi mpona kokotisa mpasi pe bobola pe ete basalelaka mbongo ya lingomba libosoliboso mpona yango."" This translates to ""Many of the complaints against priests were that they had to use their position to exploit and enrich themselves and sell indulgences for the church's benefit.""  This directly points to abuse of power (specifically financial) *within* the Church.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Soki bokaboli mosolo na lingomba ezalaki malamu (If the personal faith within the church was weak):** The passage doesn't discuss the *faith* of individuals, but the *actions* of clergy.
* **B: Soki mibeko ya motuya ya lingomba ekokaki kobongolama (If the rules of celibacy within the church could be broken):** Celibacy isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Soki mibeko ya motuya ya Lingomba ezalaki kotosama (If the rules of celibacy within the Church were being questioned):**  Again, celibacy is not a topic in the text.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nani babomaki ye na Versailles?","The correct answer is **B: Mokonzi Louis XVI**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...moto moko na kati ya bato ya mobulu aningisaki moto ya soda moko ya mokonzi oyo babomaki na Versailles liboso ya mokonzi-mwasi oyo azalaki kobanga makasi.""  This translates to ""...a person in the crowd insulted a servant of the king who had served at Versailles before the king and queen were taken prisoner.""  This clearly indicates that King Louis XVI (the ""mokonzi"") had servants who worked at Versailles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Moko ya basi bateki na Limanga** - This translates to ""Some people who died in Limanga,"" which is irrelevant to the question.
*   **C: Moko na kati ya likita** - This means ""someone in the group"" and is too vague.
*   **D: Mokengeli moko** - This means ""a messenger"" and isn't mentioned as being present at Versailles.

Kati ya mae malandi nini oyo etuluku ya bato etindaki te mokonzi mpe mwasi naye basala na makasi?,"The correct answer is **A: Kofongola maninisa ya motuka na bango (Revealing the plans of their carriages)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a man in the crowd threw a caricature of the King, which was a mocking depiction of him and the Queen. This ""caricature"" represents the revealing of plans/images mocking them, not the other options.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kolongwa Versailles na lombango (Leaving Versailles and going to Paris):** This is *what* happened, not something the crowd opposed.
*   **C: Kotala lolenge mokengeli azali kokatema kingo (Stopping a particular song from being sung):** The passage doesn't mention anything about songs.
*   **D: Mobembo kozonga Paris (The move to go to Paris):**  Again, this is *what* happened, not something the crowd was against—they were demonstratively *for* it, albeit in a hostile way.



"
Na mae malandi nini ezalaki te na kati ya boyokani ya Mboka Grande Bretagne pona Bitumba ya masuwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Mposa ya Mboka Alemgane pona kolandela lolenge moko ya kosala etumba** (Germany's desire to control how shipbuilding was done).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Allemagne ezelaki bato ete basalaka ndenge moko na bitumba ya se ya mai oyo azalaki kotika te."" This translates to ""Germany wanted the ships built in a certain way that wasn't being done."" This directly relates to Germany wanting to dictate the shipbuilding process, which is reflected in option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bamasuwa oyo ezalaki kosala te etiamaki pembeni** (Ships that weren't being built were kept aside) - The passage doesn't mention ships being kept aside.
* **C: Mbongwana esalemaki na mibeko ya bikolo** (Corruption occurred in contracts) - While the passage mentions ""mibeko endimami"" (bad contracts), it doesn't specifically say it was corruption.
* **D: Balisungi ya motuya ezalaki te** (There was no secrecy) - The passage doesn't directly address the issue of secrecy.



"
Maloba nini elobi malamu te lolenge oyo Grande Grande Bretagne epekisaki bamasuwa ya Alemagne ?,"The correct answer is **D: Esalaki ete bamasuwa oyo ezalaki ya mboka moko te ezala na kaka te.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Grande Bretagne ekomi likama ata mpona masuwa oyo eza ya mboka ata moko te."" This translates to ""Great Britain insisted that the ships not belong to any single nation.""  This directly reflects the idea that Britain wanted to prevent any one country from dominating the seas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Eboyaki kotosa mibeko ya bikolo (It tried to impose the laws of countries):** While Britain was involved in regulating trade, the main point wasn't imposing laws *of* other countries.
*   **B: Elamusaki bamasuwa ya Alemagne pona bitumba (It seized German ships for territory):**  The passage doesn't say Britain *seized* ships for territory, but rather controlled their use.
*   **C: Epekisaki balisungi ya Alemagne kokende (It sent German spies to spy):**  There's no mention of spies in the text.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, epai na nani bokono ya sclérose en plaques ekoki kozuama ?","The text states: ""Bolukiluki emoni ete basi baza na bachance mbala mibale koleka mibali ya kobela MS."" This translates to ""Studies show that women are several times more likely than men to develop MS.""

Therefore, the most likely answer is **A: Mwasi ya mbula 32 (A 32-year-old woman)**.

Here's why the other options are less likely based on the text:

*   **B: Mwana mobali ya mbula 15 (A 15-year-old boy):**  Boys are *less* likely to get MS than girls/women.
*   **C: Mobange mobali ya mbula 43 (A 43-year-old man):** Men are less likely to get MS.
*   **D: Mwana mwasi ya mbula 10 (A 10-year-old girl):** While women are more susceptible, the text doesn't specifically mention age as a factor, and 10 is quite young for this disease to typically manifest.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, bato basalaka mosala ya mbala na mbala basengeli na lisungi pona nini?","The correct answer is **A: Emoneli mabe pona mae matali pasi**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states that people repeatedly doing things (misala mbala na mbala) have a lot of trouble (lisungi mingi) because of bad consequences (lolenge ya mabe) from wanting to get ahead (kotalela mpasi).  This strongly implies they are experiencing **bad consequences for their actions** - ""emoneli mabe pona mae matali pasi"" translates to ""bad consequences for their actions"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Loketo** (Work) - While work might be involved, the passage focuses on the *results* of their actions, not the work itself.
* **C: Kozanga esengo** (Finding peace) - The passage describes trouble and bad consequences, the opposite of peace.
* **D: Somo** (Study) - Study isn't mentioned in the context of the passage.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, masano ya escrime ebetamaka ndenge nini?","The correct answer is **A: Na lolenge ya sika**.

Here's why:

* **P** states the fencing competition (escrime) is desired by many, including university students and those familiar with the Olympics. However, the core of the competition described is *people fighting each other, one falling over the other*.
* **""Na lolenge ya sika""** translates to ""in a physical way"" or ""with physical force."" This best describes the core action described in **P** – a physical contest where people are competing and falling.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Na Universite** (At the University) - While university students are *interested* in it, the passage doesn't say the competition *takes place* at the university.
* **C: Na Olimpique** (At the Olympics) - The Olympics is mentioned as a place people *know* about fencing, not where this specific competition is happening.
* **D: No lolenge ya bitumba** (With weapons) - Fencing *typically* involves weapons, but the passage doesn't specifically mention weapons, focusing only on the physical confrontation.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini ekoki kozala elembo makasi kolakisa ngenge ya kati ya nzoto?","The correct answer is **C: Misisa kokangana makasi mpe pasi na libumu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a central nervous system infection.** It mentions symptoms and a possible connection to toxins or chemical substances.
* **Misisa kokangana makasi mpe pasi na libumu (Severe headache and stiffness of the neck)** are classic, hallmark symptoms of meningitis, an infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord – a central nervous system infection.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Mposa ya kosanza mpe fievre (Weakness and fever):** While these can be *symptoms* of many illnesses, including meningitis, they are not specific enough to *define* a central nervous system infection based on the passage.
* **B: Kosanza mpe kotoka (Weakness and vomiting):**  Again, these are general symptoms.
* **D: Kopo ya kotiela bakisi (Desire to be vaccinated):** This is a preventative measure, not a symptom or defining characteristic of the infection itself.



Therefore, option C directly relates to the described infection of the central nervous system."
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini ezali eloko ya yambo oyo esengeli kosala na ngonga ya kosunga victime?","The correct answer is **C: Kotala position ya victime** (Observe the victim's position).

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

The text emphasizes the importance of *observing* (""koyeba"") the person:

*  ""...osengeli koyeba ndenge moto wana azali ntango ozali komisalisa..."" - ""...you should observe how that person is when you are approaching...""
*  ""...elembo nyonso ya drapo ya motane."" - ""...every sign of the person's body.""

This means understanding their position and how they are lying/sitting is crucial *before* attempting to help.  The other options are actions taken *after* observation.

Let's look at why the others are incorrect:

* **A: Kotala esika likama esalemi** (Go to a safe place) - Safety is important, but the text focuses on assessing the victim first.
* **B: Kopusana pembeni ya victime** (Move away from the victim) - This is the opposite of what you should do initially. You need to approach (carefully) to assess.
* **D: Kozela lisungi** (Provide aid) - You can't provide aid effectively until you've *observed* the situation and the victim's condition.



"
Na maloba mae malandi nini ekokani te na lolenge ya kotala position ya victime?,"The correct answer is **C: Tala malamu position ya victime** (Observe the victim's position).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) emphasizes observing the victim.** It states you should *not* move them unless necessary (for their safety) and *should* observe their position and any signs of injury (""elembo nyonso ya drapo ya motane"" - all signs of trauma).  Understanding their current position is crucial before attempting any assistance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Komitungisa te soki yomoko okoki kozoka** (Don't touch if you think they can move) - While avoiding unnecessary movement is good, the passage focuses on *observing* first, not simply assuming they can move.
* **B: Tala nanu esika likama yambo ay victime** (Look where the accident first happened) - The scene of the accident is important, but the passage prioritizes the victim's immediate condition.
* **D: Meka kotala malamu soki okomona elembo ya bokebisi** (Move them if you see signs of injury) - This is *incorrect* and potentially dangerous. The passage specifically states *not* to move the victim unless absolutely necessary (for their safety, like a fire).  Signs of injury are what you *observe* while leaving them in their current position.



**Translation of the passage (P) for clarity:**

""Do not touch a person you do not know who is injured, you should not move them unless there is a need to do so. You should not move how that person is lying and all the signs of injury. If they are injured and you are trying to help, you can cause them even more harm.""



"
Na kati ya BaMbongwana oyo botomboki ya ba Francais ememaki nini esalaki bokeseni makasi na bato oyo basalaka mosala?,"The correct answer is **B: Kolongola makanisi na kelasi pona kotala mingi makoki ya kosala mosala** (Challenging privileges and classes to increase opportunities for work).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Basusu bakendaka na mosala ya soda mpo bapesaka te bokonzi na kolanda bakelasi osala kasi na kolanda makoki na yo.""  This translates to ""Others struggled in social work so they wouldn't give privilege to classes but rather give opportunities to you.""  This directly relates to dismantling class privileges to improve access to work.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Komatisa lisungi pona ekolo:** (Establishing the constitution for the country) While establishing a constitution was *a result* of the revolution, it wasn't the immediate, direct benefit experienced by the working people.
* **C: Kolanda lolenge ya BaRepibliken kosala makambo:** (Adopting the laws of the Republic to do things) This is too broad. The passage focuses on the practical impact on workers.
* **D: Lolenge ya sika ya komeka makambo:** (The law of money to make things happen) This is unrelated to the core message of the passage regarding social and political change for the working class.



Therefore, option B most accurately reflects the immediate and significant benefit experienced by those who participated in the French Revolution as described in the passage."
"Kolanda botomboki ya ba francais, elonga kati ya mapinga mpe na misala misusu ekokaki kozala penza te na pona nini?","The correct answer is **B: Classe**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses social and political upheaval, specifically challenging systems of absolute power (monarchy) and advocating for republicanism, nationalism, and the idea of a nation belonging to all its people, not just a ruler.** It mentions struggles based on social standing (""bakelasi"") and opportunities denied based on birth (""bazalaki na mposa makasi"").
* **""Classe"" (class) directly relates to these struggles for equality and opportunity.**  The passage highlights the unfairness of a system where someone's potential is limited by their social class.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Mosala oyo esalemi (This work is done):** This is too vague and doesn't connect to the core themes of the passage.
    * **C: Esika esengeli kokoma (The place it needs to go):**  This is unrelated to the content.
    * **D: Lolenge ya kozala (The way to be):** While broadly philosophical, it's not specific enough to the historical and social context described.



Therefore, **Classe** is the most accurate answer, as it directly reflects the core theme of social stratification and the fight for equality that's central to the passage regarding the French Revolution."
Mosala nini ya leta oyo elobami kosala bato kozanga esengo na ba mboka oyo ekoba liboso?,"The correct answer is **C: Transport ya bato nyonso** (Transportation of all stones).

Here's why:

The passage directly discusses the challenges and frustrations surrounding the transportation of stones (""Bato nyonso basanganaka na lisanga pe basalelaka transport ya bato nyonso""). The entire problem centers around *how* this transportation is happening and why people are unhappy with it.  The question asks what the central issue is that causes people to dislike the situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lolenge ya mai** (Water level) - While mentioned as a factor *affecting* transportation, it's not the core issue people are complaining about.
*   **B: Botongi ba gbagba** (Broken bags) - This is a *result* of the poor transportation, not the root problem.
*   **D: Kelasi** (Classes) - This is irrelevant to the passage.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini ekoki kolobama na mae malandi transport pona bato nyonso?","The correct answer is **A: Elingami na bato nyonso oyo basalelaka yango** (It concerns everyone who uses it).

Here's why:

* **The original text (P) highlights the frustration of everyone using the transport system.** It talks about everyone being affected by its poor condition, and the discomfort and risks involved.  The question (Q) asks what can be learned from these complaints. The most direct takeaway is that the transport issue affects *everyone*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ezali mabe penza te lokola mai** (It's not bad as that) - The text clearly states the transport *is* bad, causing discomfort and risks.
* **C: Esalaka ete bato oyo basalelaka yango balobaloba mingi** (It shows that those who use it complain a lot) - While people are complaining, the core issue isn't just the complaints themselves, it's the *reason* for the complaints – the poor quality of the transport.
* **D: Ezali ya ofele na ba mboka mingi oyo ekoba liboso** (It is useful in many countries that are far away) - The text doesn't mention anything about other countries; it focuses on the local transport problem.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi ekoki kozala makasi pona komeka kolanda bizaleli makasi ya bakumbi mituka.?","The correct answer is **C: Lolenge Makambo ezali kosalema na nzela** (The state of things happening on the road).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on understanding traffic flow.** It defines key elements like débit (flow rate), densité (density), and vitese (speed) – all describing the *state* of the road and how traffic is behaving.  Understanding this state is crucial for predicting and preventing accidents.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Vitesi ya bokumbi (Speed of vehicles):** While speed *is* part of traffic flow, it's only one component. The passage emphasizes a holistic understanding beyond just speed.
* **B: Kolengela banzela bisika mituka ezo tambola (Mapping the routes vehicles take):** Knowing *where* cars go is less important than knowing *how* they are moving and the conditions on the road.
* **D: Lolenge mituka ezotambola (The state of vehicles moving):** This is too focused on the vehicles themselves and doesn't address the overall flow and conditions of the road, which is the passage’s central theme.



Therefore, understanding the overall state of things happening on the road (density, flow, speed, potential congestion) is the most useful information for improving road safety and understanding driver behavior."
Na mae malandi nini oyo esalemaka mingi na nzela ya mathematique pona kolakisa lolenge mituka etambolaka?,"The correct answer is **C: Lolenge nzela esalemi** (The properties of the road).

Here's why:

The passage specifically discusses how traffic flow is modeled mathematically to understand how vehicles move and interact on roads. It then introduces three key properties (débit, densité, vitese) that *define* the state of traffic flow on a road.  These properties are inherent to the *road* and how traffic behaves *on* that road.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lolenge Makambo ezali kosalema na nzela** (The things that are being calculated on the road) - This is too broad. The passage isn't about what *calculations* are done, but the *things being measured* to do those calculations.
* **B: Bizaleli ya mokumbi** (Driver behavior) - While driver behavior influences traffic, the passage focuses on the quantifiable aspects of traffic *itself*, not the individual choices of drivers.
* **D: Bato boni bazali kosalela nzela** (How many people are using the road) -  This is related to density, but doesn't encompass the full picture of traffic flow (débit and vitese are also important).



"
Hershey na Chase bamekaki nini pona kolona ADN nabango? ,"The correct answer is **A: Phosphore radioactive**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bamekaki makambo mibale, eza na **ADN na phage na phosphore oyo eza radioactif**, to na protéine ya phage oyo eza na soufre ya radioactif."" 

This directly translates to: ""They did things, with the **DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus**, or with the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.""

Hershey and Chase used radioactive phosphorus to specifically label the DNA of the phages. This allowed them to track where the DNA went during the infection process and demonstrate that it was the DNA, not the protein, that entered the bacteria.



"
Makoki mpo mbongwana epesama na bana elandani na nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Soki baselile ebotaka** (If the child is sick).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mbongwana ya baselile pamba ekoki kopesama na bana, kasi mbongwana mosusu ekoki koboma baselile to kopesa maladi ya kansere.""  This translates to ""A healthy child's stem cells can be given to children, but other stem cells can harm the child or cause cancer.""  The context clearly links stem cell donation to *sick* children needing help.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ntina ya gene oyo ebotaka** (The nature of the gene that is sick) - While genes are involved, the passage doesn't specify that the *gene itself* determines if stem cells are suitable. It's about the child's *illness*.
* **C: Lolenge ya mbongwana** (The type of stem cell) - The passage highlights the *difference* in stem cell types (healthy vs. potentially harmful), but doesn't say type determines suitability for donation *to children*.
* **D: Soki mbongwana ekoki kotinda selile ekufa** (If the stem cell can cause the child to die) - This is the opposite of what the passage implies.  Healthy stem cells are *helping* a child, not harming them.



"
"Kolanda bansango ebele oyo epesami na maloba wana, bizaleli nini ebele oyo mbongwana etalelaka te?","The correct answer is **A: Ba gene ya kobota boni oyo ezui bokono**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses genes and their role in cancer.** It states that some genes *cause* cancer (""mbongwana mosusu ekoki koboma baselile to kopesa maladi ya kansere""). The passage also talks about genes being passed down (""eteni ya gene oyo ebongwani"").
* **The question asks what a healthy individual *doesn't* have.** A healthy individual doesn't have the *faulty/mutated genes* that lead to cancer. ""Ba gene ya kobota boni"" translates to ""faulty genes"" or ""genes that don't work well.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Soki baselile oyo ezui bokono ebotaka:** This refers to when mutated genes are active, which is something a healthy person *wouldn't* have active. But it doesn't address the core lack - the presence of the mutated gene itself.
* **C: Ntina ya ba gene oyo ezui bokono:** This refers to the number of faulty genes, not the fact of *having* them.
* **D: Lolenge ya mbongwana oyo ezali affecter:** This refers to the *effect* of the genes (the disease), not the genes themselves.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer as it directly addresses what a healthy person lacks – the problematic genes that cause cancer."
Na mae malandi nini oyo ezali te kati ya bantina pona nini bakoko ya kala babatelaki bantaba?,"The correct answer is **A: Bapesaki bango nyama ya koliya** (They gave them meat to eat).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...bokoko pe bikolo ya kala ezalaki kobatela yango po bazwa miliki, **suki**, misuni mpe bamposo.""  ""Suki"" translates to meat. The passage directly links the keeping of dogs to providing them with food – meat, specifically – in exchange for their services (hunting, guarding).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Basungaki koleisa matiti:** While the passage mentions hunting in mountainous/rocky areas, it doesn't state dogs were used to *build* shelters.
* **C: Basungaki na kobika elongo na bato:** The text doesn't mention dogs being used for carrying things for people.
* **D: Basungaki nakopesa miliki:** While dogs helped *obtain* milk (by hunting animals that provided milk), they weren't given milk *as* payment. They were *given* meat.



"
Litomba ya golf ezali kozua nini mukie?,"The correct answer is **D: Mabulu**.

Here's why:

The passage clearly states the goal of golf is to hit the *banzete* (ball) into the *mabulu* (holes). The entire description revolves around getting the ball *into* the holes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Babalon:**  This refers to the clubs used to hit the ball, not the objective.
*   **B: Badiemba:** This seems to refer to the number of strokes, a *way* to measure performance, but not the goal itself.
*   **C: Ngonga:** This doesn't appear in the context and isn't related to golf.



"
"Na terain golfe , matiti ekatemaka mukuse mingi na esika nini?","The correct answer is **A: Na libulu ya zomi na mwambe** (On the fairway).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...basani babandaka na libulu ya liboso pe basukisaka na libublu ya zomi na mwambe.""  This translates to ""...players start on the tee and finish on the fairway.""  It also says the holes are made *on* the fairway (""matiti ya zingazinga ya libulu bakataka yango mpo ezala mokuse..."").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Na vert (On the green):** The green is where players *aim* to get to, not where the holes are initially created.
*   **C: Na libulu ya yambo (On the tee):** Players *start* on the tee, they don't make holes there.
*   **D: Na eteni ya yambo ya terain (On the edge of the tee of the terrain):** This is not a standard golf term and isn't supported by the text.



"
Litomba monene ya komekameka ezali nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Pona kolongola likanisi moko to ebele ya biyano** (To test a single hypothesis or a set of hypotheses).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...komeka, mpe komeka eza eloko basalaka mpona kolongola likanisi moko to makanisi mingi...""  This directly translates to ""...experimentation, and experimentation is what they use specifically to test a single hypothesis or many hypotheses...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pona kososola ndenge nini mokili ezali kotambola** (To explain how something works) - While science *aims* to explain how things work, experimentation itself is the *process* of testing explanations, not the explanation itself.
* **C: Pona kotuna mituna** (To use data) - Data is *collected* during experimentation, but using data isn't the primary *purpose* of experimentation.
* **D: Pona kosalisa bolukiluki ya siansi** (To conduct scientific research) - Experimentation is *part* of scientific research, but it's not the defining, overarching goal.  The goal is to test hypotheses *within* that research.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini esungaka te bolukiluki ya siansi?","The correct answer is **A: Metode ya siansi yango moko to lolenge ya kosala**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that while the scientific method is *used* in many scientific investigations, it's not the *only* thing that drives scientific research. It highlights that creativity and the ability to challenge existing theories (or multiple theories) are also crucial for scientific progress.  This means a rigid adherence to *only* the scientific method or a specific way of doing things can hinder research.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lolenge ya kosala botali:** (A specific way of doing things) - The passage actually argues *against* being limited to a single way of doing things.
* **C: Kolongola makanisi ya biyano:** (Challenging existing theories) - The passage *supports* this as a valuable component of scientific research.
* **D: Kosala bolukiluki:** (Conducting research) -  Research itself isn't what hinders scientific progress; it's limiting *how* that research is conducted.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, maloba nini na mae matali mpela ezali ya solo te?","The correct answer is **A: Mpela ekoki kobebisa biloko nyonso liboso na yango** (Mpela can destroy everything in its path).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mpela ekoki koboma biloko nyonso na nzela ntango ezoleka"" - meaning ""Mpela can destroy everything in its path when it appears.""  Option A directly reflects this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mpela ebetaka bisika mikie mikie kokokanisa te na mipepe misusu** (Mpela does not have small feet to compete with other tornadoes) - The passage doesn't mention anything about feet or competition.
* **C: Ebele ya ba mpela ewumelaka koleka bangonga misato** (Currently, tornadoes are becoming more frequent) - While the passage mentions frequent occurrences, it doesn't state it's a *current* trend.
* **D: Ba mpela misusu ekoki kozala na mipepe pene ya 300 kilometres par heuere** (Other tornadoes can be at speeds close to 300 kilometers per hour) - The passage specifically states *this* mpela reaches 480 km/h, making this statement potentially true for *other* tornadoes but not directly related to the description of *this* mpela.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, maloba nini kati ya mae malandi esosolisi malamu ba mpela ebele?","The correct answer is **B: Ebotaka mipepe pene ya 480 kilometres per heuere** (It throws pebbles nearly 480 kilometers per hour).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Mipepe wana ya mabe ekoki kokoma kino na 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).""  This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ewumelaka mingimingi koleka bangonga misato:** (It often resembles small horns) - While the passage mentions horns, it doesn't focus on *resemblance* as a primary characteristic.
* **C: Ebetaka bisika minene koleka mipepe misusu:** (It has larger scales than other pebbles) - The passage doesn't compare the size of its scales to other pebbles.
* **D: Bazali na makoki ya kotimola banzete na mabele:** (They have the ability to crush bones and tear flesh) - This describes the *effect* of the mpela's attacks, not a core feature of the mpela itself.



"
Kati na mae malandi bato ba bandaki kosala nini na ekeke ya 16?,"The correct answer is **D: Kosala batelescope**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Batelescope ya liboso ya solo esalemaki na Eropa na suka ya ekeke ya 16."" (The first telescopes were made in Europe at the beginning of the 17th century - which is still within the 1600s/16th century timeframe).  

The question asks what people were doing in the 16th century. The passage *specifically* says they were making telescopes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kosalela maneti:** While the passage mentions looking at the stars (""kosalela maneti""), it says they *used* telescopes to do so, not that making telescopes *is* looking at stars.
* **B: Kokomisa biloko minene:**  The passage says the telescope *made* distant objects appear larger, not that people were trying to see large objects.
* **C: Kosala maneti:**  Again, this is the *result* of using the telescope, not what people were actively *doing* in the 16th century.



"
Pona ngonga boni bato basili kokokomisa biloko mineneminene na nzela ya maneti?,"The correct answer is **D: Banda ebandeli ya ekeke ya 16**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Batelescope ya liboso ya solo esalemaki na Eropa na suka ya ekeke ya 16."" (The first telescopes were made in Europe at the beginning of the 17th century).  This directly answers the question of *when* people started observing large objects in the heavens using telescopes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pona mbula nkoto moko:** (For a long time) - Too vague. The passage specifies a timeframe.
*   **B: Kobanda bikeke 16 eleki:** (After the 16th century) -  While observation continued *after* the 16th century, the *beginning* is the answer the passage provides.
*   **C: Pona bambula nkoto:** (For many years) - Again, too vague; doesn't pinpoint the start.

"Kolanda maloba wana, libulu ya Muhammad elobi nini na mae matali mimesano naye ya kimolimo to bizaleli ya malamu?","The correct answer is **D: Akokaki kozela te bato bamona mpe koyoka ye.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ya solo, eza pete te na kozwa yango ata soki oyebi ete ezali. Soki okoti na kati ya libulu, eza mpenza yango moko. Eloko moko te ekoki komonana longola kaka likolo oyo eza polele pe kitoko mpe bangomba kitoko ya zingazinga. Moto moko te akokaki koyoka to komona yango soki aza na kati ya libulu."" 

This translates to: ""Truly, it is impossible to find it even if you know it exists. If you enter the cave, it is a different matter. Nothing can be seen except a noble face and righteous worshippers. No one can leave or see it if they are inside the cave.""

This directly describes the cave's ability to conceal Muhammad and prevent anyone from seeing or leaving.  Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Abatelaka makasi kimia mpe kozala yemoko:** (It offered chemical benefits and self-existence) - The text doesn’t mention anything about chemical benefits.
* **B: Makelele ya libanda ekoki kosunga komaniola:** (The cave's darkness could sustain life) - The text doesn't focus on sustainability, but concealment.
* **C: Azalaki na mposa ya kozala yemoko pona ngonga mukuse:** (He had the power to be alone for religious reasons) - While Muhammad *was* practicing his faith, the passage emphasizes the cave’s protective and concealing properties, not his religious motivation for being there.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, libende ebandaki kosalema yambo mpona bosenga nini?","The correct answer is **A: Bisika ya kokatisa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Babakisaki bisika ya kokatisa malamu na ebandeli po banzela ebeba te."" This translates to ""They started using wedges to prevent the wheels from turning so the railway wouldn't move.""  This clearly indicates that wedges were used *first* to try and prevent the trains from moving downhill.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Banzela ya bingbunduku** - This refers to the railway itself, not something used to control it initially.
* **C: Bapneu** -  Pneumatics (bapneu) came later, after they realized brakes were needed.
* **D: Banzela ya engbunduka** - This refers to a later improvement to the railway, not the initial method of control.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, pona nini nzela ya engbunduka ya mabaya embongwanaki pona kotiya nzela ya engbunduka ya mabende?","The correct answer is **B: Emonanaki kozala makasi mpe malamu mingi** (They found it to be stronger and more efficient).

Here's why:

The text states that initially, wagons were built using wood (mabaya). However, they realized the tracks would be *better* (malamu) if built with iron (libende).  While the initial wooden tracks were cheaper (bisika ya kokatisa malamu), the iron tracks proved superior in strength and efficiency.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ematisaki vitesi ya punda:** (They reduced the speed of the horses) - The text doesn't mention horse speed being a factor.
* **C: Ezalaki na makasi ya komema mikumba ya kilo:** (It was capable of carrying more kilograms) - While the goal was to carry heavy loads, the text doesn't say iron tracks specifically allowed for *more* weight, only that they were sturdier.
* **D: Ezalaki kobebisama na libende ya nzela:** (It was connected to the iron of the road) - This is a bit circular; the point is *why* they switched to iron, not just that it *was* iron.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na tango ya BaRoma nini emonisaki bato lolenge ya kozala?","The correct answer is **A: Mibeko (Customs/Traditions)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ezalaki malamu koleka mibeko oyo bapesi bato na makasi."" This translates to ""...it was good except for the customs they imposed on people by force.""
* **The question asks:** What caused problems for people in Rome?
* **The passage directly links the problems to the *mibeko* (customs/traditions) imposed on them.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Geografie (Geography):** The passage mentions the *place* of Rome, but doesn't say geography caused the problems.
* **C: Kibokoko (Politics/Power):** While power dynamics are implied, the *mibeko* are explicitly stated as the issue.
* **D: Milende (Trends/Movements):** The passage refers to intellectual movements, but not as the direct cause of the problems in Rome.



"
Na mae malandi nini elobi malamu te makanisi munene ya mayele ya determinisme ? ,"The correct answer is **A: Makambo tekonolozi esalaka na lisanga ya bato bango moko bapesaka ndingisa** (The things technology does in the lives of individuals provide counter-examples).

Here's why:

* **The passage argues against a *strong* determinism.** It states that technology doesn't automatically dictate outcomes (political or otherwise), and doesn't have inherent ""agency.""  The example of car accidents illustrates this: just because cars *enable* speed doesn't mean accidents are inevitable, nor does the technology itself *decide* someone will crash.  Individual choices and factors still play a role.
* **Option A directly addresses this:** The passage highlights how technology interacts with individual lives in complex ways. This interaction provides examples that disprove the idea that technology rigidly determines everything.  People can *choose* to drive safely or recklessly, using the technology in different ways.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bokobi malamu ya tekonolozi esalemaki te kouta na molende** (The good of technology does not depend on profit) - This isn't the point of the passage. The argument is about causality and free will, not about the ethics of profit.
* **C: Tekonolozi ezali na ba effects naturel epai na bato** (Technology has natural effects on people) -  This is true, but it doesn't address the *determinism* argument. The passage acknowledges effects, but disputes that these effects are *predetermined* and inescapable.
* **D: Bokobi malamu ya tekonolozi esalemi te na makambo ya politike** (The good of technology does not depend on politics) - Similar to B, this is irrelevant to the main argument about whether technology *determines* outcomes.



"
"Kolanda moloba wana, kati ya mae malandi nini oyo elandani te na bobendi bow?","The correct answer is **B: Elembo oyo ezali komonana lokola agrafe** (The symbol that looks like a staple).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...agrafe to carré ezangi nzela ya se."" (…a staple or square marks the way of the bow).  It then goes on to explain how to draw the bow. The passage focuses on the difficulty of properly drawing the bow and mentions needing to practice. The staple/agrafe symbol is presented as a visual aid for understanding the bow direction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mongongo ya pete** (The sound of a bell) - The passage doesn't mention anything about bells or their sounds.
*   **C: Mongongo ya Makasi koleka** (The sound of beautiful music) - While the passage alludes to music, it doesn't specifically talk about beautiful sounds. It's about the *technique* of playing.
*   **D: Kobanda ligorodo** (Bending the neck) -  The passage *mentions* bending the neck, but it's a step *in* the process of bowing, not something one struggles to understand *how* to do. The core difficulty described is understanding the bow direction indicated by the symbol.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, kati ya mae malandi nini ekokani na mongongo ya malamu mingi?","The correct answer is **A: Elembo ya down bow** (The down bow symbol).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...oyo ya """"down bow mark"""" neti agrafe to carré ezangi nzela ya se."" (…the """"down bow mark"""" is a staple or square that indicates the direction of the bow.)  It then goes on to explain how the down bow impacts playing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kobenda bow** (Bending the bow) - While bending the bow is part of playing, the passage focuses on *indicating* the bow direction, not the act of bending itself.
* **C: Elembo oyo ezali komonana lokola V** (The symbol that looks like a V) - The passage says the *up bow* is like a V, not the down bow.
* **D: Kobanda esika oyo loboko nayo ezali kosimba bow** (To place where your hand rests while bowing) - This describes hand position, not the symbol itself.



"
Mikwa ya kala emonisi maboko ekomaki kosalema mpona motindi nini kati ya mae malandi?,"The correct answer is **C: Lokomotion**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mikwa ya kala oyo esa bambula bamilio mibale to bamilio misato emonisaki bokeseni wana na **ndenge ya kosalela yango**."" (Those ancient apes revealed millions or several million years ago showed the bones in a way **to use them**).  The context is about how the bones show adaptations for movement – *lokomotion* – specifically for both climbing and eventually, more efficient walking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kosala na maboko (Working with hands):** While hand use is *a result* of the adaptations, it's not what the ancient bones *demonstrated* in their structure.
*   **B: Komema kilo (Climbing trees):**  Climbing is mentioned, but the passage focuses on the broader adaptation of how the hands were used for locomotion, not *just* climbing.
*   **D: Kosalela loboko pona kotambola (Using the hand for walking):** This is too specific. While the hands *contributed* to locomotion, the adaptation wasn't solely for walking with hands. It was a more general shift in how they moved.



"
Na mae malandi nini elobeli malamu baphalanges ya mokomboso ? ,"The correct answer is **A: Ezali semba koleka maboko ya moto**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Loboko ya moto eza mokuse koleka lokolo, ezalaka na phalanges ya semba."" (The hand of a human is shorter than the foot, and has short phalanges.) This directly answers the question about the characteristics of the phalanges.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maboko mpe makolo nabango ekeseni na kimolai:** While true that hands and feet are similar, it doesn't specifically address the *phalanges* themselves.
* **C: Esalemaka pona komema mikumba:** The passage mentions using hands for climbing, but doesn't focus on gripping branches as the key feature of the phalanges.
* **D: Ezalaka yambo pona kosalela:** While early primates used their hands for grasping, this doesn't describe what the phalanges *are* like.



"
Boponami elongolaka variation genetique na pole nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Ya kobombana (Recombination)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Bolukiluki ya ekeke ya tuku mibale emonisi ete eza na bapole mibale oyo gentique: ya kobombana na oyo emonanaka.""  This translates to ""The genetic variation arises from the poles that are genetic: by recombining with those that are observed.""  This directly links genetic variation to recombination.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Baoyo eyebana (Living organisms):** While living organisms *have* genetic variation, they don't *cause* it.
* **C: Kokabola (Mutation):** Mutation is a source of genetic variation, but the passage specifically highlights recombination as the mechanism described.
* **D: Ya komonana (Observation):**  Observing something doesn't create genetic variation.



Therefore, **Ya kobombana (Recombination)** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
Eteni nini esali ete kobongwana genetique ebakisama?,"The correct answer is **C: Mbongwana**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mbongwana ebakisa lolenge ya sika ya bagene..."" (Mutation causes changes in the price of genes...). This directly links mutation to the initiating factor in genetic variation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kokabola:** While *kokabola* (mutation) is *caused by* the genetic variation, it isn't the source of it.
*   **B: Baoyo eyebana:**  *Baoyo eyebana* (living things) are the *result* of genetic variation, not the cause.
*   **D: Ya komonana:** *Ya komonana* (to observe/see) is related to identifying variation, not causing it.



"
"Kolanda bansango na maloba wana, na mae malandi nini oyo esengeli nyama primate aliya pona kosilisa “likambo ya vitamine?”","The correct answer is **C: Banyama mikiemikie oyo baliaka matiti**.

Here's why, based on the text (P):

* **The text states:** ""...bilei euti na banyama (fourmis, termites, maki) esilaka malamu na libumu, kasi epesaki baproteine mingi oyo ezalaka na baaside mingi ya ntina."" (Insects like ants, termites, and larvae are easy to digest and provide a lot of protein with a lot of essential acids.)
* **The text continues:** ""...tokoki kokamwa te soki bakoko na biso babongisaki """"makambo na bango ya vitamine"""" ndenge makaku esalaka yango sikoyo na esobe."" (We don't know if they supplement ""things related to vitamins"" the way a stomach does now.)

This indicates that insects are a good source of essential acids (and potentially vitamins) that primates might need, especially if they cannot efficiently digest plant matter. The passage implies insects fulfill a role similar to vitamin supplementation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Matiti ya kokauka (Dried fruits):** The text doesn't mention dried fruits as a source of essential acids or anything resembling vitamins.
* **B: Bandunda ya mobesu (Good roots):** Similar to dried fruits, roots are not highlighted as a crucial component for nutritional balance.
* **D: Nzete ya fololo (River fish):** While fish are nutritious, the passage specifically focuses on the role of insects in providing necessary nutrients for primates.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, kati ya makambo oyo elandi likambo nini esalemaka te pona kozanga aside amino ya ntina?","The correct answer is **A: Mikakatano ya libumu** (Digestive problems).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lisusu, kozanga kosala yango ememaka mikakatano minene: koniokwama makasi na makanisi, kolia malamu te mpe sukasuka liwa. ...Kasi, bilei euti na banyama (fourmis, termites, maki) esilaka malamu na libumu...""  This translates to: ""Also, trying to digest it causes big problems: severe constipation, inability to digest well and diarrhea. ...However, eating insects (ants, termites, caterpillars) is easy on the stomach, but provides a lot of protein with a lot of formic acid.""

The passage directly links difficulties with digestion (mikakatano ya libumu) to the challenge of processing the protein from the primate's digestive system for humans.  It contrasts this with the ease of digesting insects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Koliya mabe** (Bad digestion) - While mentioned as a symptom, it's not the root *cause* of the difficulty in getting amino acids.
*   **C: Mikakatano pona kokola** (Problems for cutting) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Liwa** (Diarrhea) - Similar to ""bad digestion,"" it's a symptom, not the fundamental obstacle.



"
Lolenge nini bakitani ya molende mbala na mbala bamonisaka kozala nabango kati ya likita?,"The correct answer is **D: Na nzela ya kosalela ndenge ya kobika lokola elembo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""...mbala mingi, bato ya bituluku ya mike bamonisaka ete baza bato na yango na nzila ya lolenge moko ya polele mpi ya bilembo, na ndakisa midele, lolenge ya kosala makambo mpe elobeli moko boye.""  This translates to ""...often, people of small groups identify with each other through a specific way of dressing and symbols, through customs, ways of doing things, and a unique behavior.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Na nzela ya komeka komiyoka nsomi na kati** (Through seeking knowledge within) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **B: Na nzela ya kolanda bondimeli ya moto nyonso nzinganzinga** (Through respecting the value of every powerful person) - The passage focuses on group identity, not individual power.
* **C: Na nzela ya kondima mibeko ya likita** (Through breaking the rules of society) - The passage states they *are* creating their own rules/norms, not necessarily *breaking* existing societal ones, though it can sometimes lead to that.  The key is the *creation* of a shared identity.



Therefore, option D best reflects the way groups establish identity and belonging as described in the text."
"Kolanda lisolo oyo epesami na maloba wana, nini ekoki kokomela mwana oyo azali konyokwama na likama ya rasisme oyo azali komonana na bizaleli ya matata.","The correct answer is **B: Mwana akoki kobanda kozala na bizaleli ya matata.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P)** describes children who are often overlooked or underestimated because of their background (specifically, children from poorer families). It highlights the prejudice they face and how it affects their opportunities.
* **The question (Q)** asks about helping a child cope with the *effects* of racism they experience from their parents. 
* **Option B** – ""A child can learn to overcome having difficult parents"" – directly addresses this.  The passage implies that these children face hardship *because* of the limitations and prejudices held by those around them (including their family). Learning to overcome this is a key coping mechanism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mwana akomeka koboya kozala na bizaleli ya matata** – ""A child must accept having difficult parents."" Acceptance isn't necessarily the goal; overcoming the negative impacts is more constructive.
* **C: Mwana akomibenda na makambo oyo etali bato misusu** – ""A child should adapt to what others say.""  This encourages conformity and doesn't address the root problem of prejudice.
* **D: Mwana akoboya kosangana na bato ya bikolo misusu ya mikiemikie** – ""A child should associate with different, powerful people."" While exposure to diverse perspectives can be helpful, it doesn't directly address the challenge of overcoming prejudiced parenting.



Therefore, **B** is the most relevant and helpful response given the context of the passage and the question."
"Kolanda na maloba wana, mwana oyo azali na boyebi ya makambo ya rasisme akoki kozala na bizaleli nini kati ya mae malandi?","The most fitting answer, based on the prompt (P), is **D: Lolenge naye ya kolimbola mposo ya nzoto** (The ability to fight against racism).

Here's why:

* **The prompt (P) describes children experiencing or witnessing discrimination (""baposo ya nzoto"") and the impact it has on their development and self-esteem.**  It highlights how children might internalize negative beliefs about themselves based on societal prejudice.
* **The question (Q) asks what a child *with awareness of racism* can develop.**  Awareness is the first step towards actively combating it.
* **Option D directly addresses this:** The ability to fight against racism is a positive outcome of understanding and recognizing injustice.  It empowers the child to challenge prejudice rather than be defeated by it.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ekolo to mposo ya nzoto ya mukie oyo aponi lokola yaye** (Environment or racism of the adult who raised him/her like that) - While environment is a factor, the question focuses on what the *child* develops *because* of their awareness.
* **B: Bizaleli naye** (His/her qualities) - Too vague. The prompt is specifically about the impact of racism.
* **C: Lolenge na ya kobika na bana misusu** (The ability to compare to other children) -  While comparison might happen, it's not a constructive development stemming from racial awareness.  It's more about self-assessment, which is related to but not the core of fighting injustice.



Therefore, **D** is the most logical and direct answer within the context of the provided text."
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini ekoki te komonana bokolisi ya mwana “feral” to mwana ya zamba?","The correct answer is **C: Bizaleli ya kolinga kozala mosika na bato** (The ability to relate to people).

Here's why:

The passage describes ""feral"" or ""zamba"" children as lacking fundamental social skills and connections. They haven't been raised with human interaction, leading to difficulties in understanding and interacting with others. They are described as being treated cruelly, abandoned, or even raised with animals.  The core problem is their *lack of development of social abilities* – the ability to form bonds, understand social cues, and function within a human community.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kobika yemoko (Self-sufficiency):** While a feral child might *have* to be self-sufficient to survive, that's a *result* of their situation, not the defining characteristic preventing their integration.  Their lack of social skills is the primary obstacle.
* **B: Lolenge makasi ya kosolola (Extreme shyness):**  Shyness is a personality trait.  Feral children's issues are far more fundamental than simply being shy; they lack the *understanding* of social interaction.
* **D: Kozanga koyeba kobika na lisanga ya bato (Wanting to remain hidden from people):** This is a likely *outcome* of their experiences, but not the root cause of their inability to integrate. They aren't intentionally hiding; they simply don’t understand how to interact.



Therefore, the passage strongly suggests that the crucial missing element for integrating a feral child is the development of social skills and the ability to relate to others."
"Kolanda maloba wana, kati ya mae malandi nini elimboli malamu bizaleli ya zamba na bana ?","The correct answer is **A: Ebele ya bizaleli ya zamba na bana etindamaka na likama songolo na nzoto** (The effect of feral upbringing on children manifests in emotional and psychological damage).

Here's why:

* **The passage details significant psychological and emotional harm.** It describes children being neglected, abused, and isolated, leading to difficulties forming relationships, potential for violence, and overall stunted development.  The passage explicitly mentions ""ndakisa mabe ya bana mingi"" (many bad consequences for children) and the lasting impact on their emotional well-being.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Bizaleli ya zamba ekoki kouta na kozanga kobika na bato** (Feral upbringing can result in becoming attached to people) - While *some* feral children were eventually adopted, the passage focuses on the *negative* consequences, not successful integration. The passage highlights difficulties with social interaction.
    * **C: Bizaleli ya zamba na bana ezalaka mingi kaka na baoyo baboti bakangaki bango** (Feral upbringing of children is often only with those who abandon them) - The passage mentions children being left with animals, or raised entirely by animals, not just abandoned by people.
    * **D: Bizaleli nyonso ya zamba etindamaka mikakatano ya mayele** (All feral upbringing results in mental illness) -  The passage doesn't state *all* cases lead to mental illness, just that there are significant psychological damages.

**Therefore, option A most accurately reflects the primary message of the passage regarding the effects of feral upbringing on children – profound emotional and psychological damage.**



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mimesano oyo elandi ya wapi ekokani te na boloni oyo babengaka « agriculture de subsistance » ?","The correct answer is **A: Kotalela mingi kolona oyo ekokokisa bosenga ya moloni na libota naye** (Focusing heavily on the colony that supports the farmer's family and work).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes subsistence agriculture as being primarily focused on providing for the farmer's own needs and those of their family.** It emphasizes self-sufficiency (""biloko bakolya mpe eza kaka bongo"").  The passage highlights that it’s not about large-scale production or profit.
* **Option B** (Colony for supplying others) is the *opposite* of subsistence agriculture – it implies surplus production for trade.
* **Option C** (Focusing on the colony before efficient methods) doesn't align with the passage's description. The passage mentions biological techniques being used, suggesting some level of method.
* **Option D** (Harvesting the yield of the land the farmer cultivates) is a general description of farming, but doesn’t specifically address the *nature* of subsistence agriculture, which is self-reliance.



Therefore, option A most accurately reflects the core principle of ""agriculture de subsistance"" as described in the text."
Na mae malandi nini elimboli malamau bizaleli ya agriculture de subsistance ?,"The correct answer is **A: Bibongiseli na yango ezalaka ya biologie**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kolona biloko oyo babengaka agriculture de subsistance ezalaka pete, mbala mingi **bibongiseli ya biologie esalelaka milona oyo babomba** mpe basangisi yango na biloko euta na bamboka mosusu to basalelaka mayele mosusu ya pete pmona kobuka mbuma mingi."" (Subsistence farming often relies on **biological principles** to improve yields and adapt to different environments or use different varieties to increase production.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Esalelaka technique ya bokeseni po milona ezala mingi:** While modern agriculture uses technology, the passage focuses on *biological* strategies specifically within subsistence farming.
* **C: Esungaka baloni kopesa miloni na bango na etuka na bango:** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Ezali kokoba kosalema na baloni na bamboka misusu:**  The passage mentions adapting *to* other environments, not necessarily *relying* on others.



"
Kokende na musee ekoki kozala na lolenge nini ya tourisme?,"The correct answer is **C: Tourisme ya koyeba bokoko** (Dark Tourism).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly describes sites associated with death, disaster, and suffering – places people visit to confront mortality and reflect on tragic events. This is the core definition of dark tourism (""tourisme ya koyeba bokoko"").  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tourisme ya mombongo (Mass Tourism):** The passage doesn't focus on large numbers of tourists, but the *type* of place they visit.
* **B: Tourisme ya kopema (Relaxation Tourism):**  The described sites are the opposite of relaxing.
* **D: Tourisme ya libanda (Adventure Tourism):** While visiting these sites might be an experience, the primary motivation isn't adventure, but rather a connection to history and tragedy.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini ekoki kozala ya litomba pona basali mobembo ya tourisme ya recreation?","The correct answer is **A: Komizindisa mobimba na bango na kibokoko ya esika** (Developing infrastructure and security of the site).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the dangers of unregulated tourism.** People are going to remote locations, often getting lost, needing rescue, and potentially facing life-threatening situations. It mentions the lack of proper infrastructure (""baparke ya kitoko pe bisika ya esobe"") and the difficulty of rescues.
* **Option A directly addresses these issues.**  Improving infrastructure (roads, trails, facilities) and security (rescue services, guides, clear markings) would make recreational tourism safer and more sustainable.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Kozua bopemi na misala na bango ya mikolo nyonso** (Providing health and hygiene for all days) - While important, this is a secondary concern. Safety and accessibility are primary.
* **C: Komona bamboka na bisika ya malonga** (Seeing benefits from traditional stories) - The passage doesn't mention traditional stories, and this doesn't address the core problem of safety.
* **D: Kososola istware ya Esika** (Updating the history of the site) -  History is interesting, but doesn't solve the immediate dangers faced by tourists.



"
Nini epatemi na kati ya maloba wana lokola eloko oyo esungaki pona kokitisa kobanga mbongwana na kati ya lingomba ya esika?,"The correct answer is **A: Kokanisa ba ngonga ya malamu ya kimombongo** (To compare the positive impacts of the situation).

Here's why:

* **The passage heavily focuses on the *positive* outcomes and benefits resulting from the described situation.** It talks about people achieving good things, finding work, and the overall improvement in their lives due to the opportunities created.  The passage emphasizes the *good* that comes from this ""change"" or ""situation"" (lisanga).
* **Let's break down why the other options are less accurate:**
    * **B: Kolinga kososola bato oyo basalaki malamu na molende ya lisanga** (To help people who have suffered in the situation) - While helping those affected is *a result* of understanding the situation, it's not the core *purpose* being described in the text.
    * **C: Kososola ba ntina ya Lisanga** (To fix the issues of the situation) - The text doesn't focus on *fixing* problems, but on the good that arises despite potential challenges.
    * **D: Koyeba istware ya ya lisanga** (To understand the history of the situation) -  The passage isn't primarily historical; it's about the current impact and potential for future benefits.

**The passage is essentially saying that by analyzing and understanding the *positive effects* (ngonga ya malamu) of this situation, people can leverage it to build a better future (mbongwana) for their community.**



"
"Kolanda na maloba wana, kozua bososoli ya lisaponge nayo ekosunga moto na nini?","The correct answer is **B: Kolendisa bizaleli ya malamu** (Promoting good relationships).

Here's why:

The text repeatedly emphasizes how understanding others' situations (their ""lisolo"" - state, condition, or fate) and showing empathy (""koyeba makasi na biso mpe makambo tolingaka"") leads to better interactions, collaboration, and ultimately, a more harmonious society.  It highlights how this understanding fosters positive outcomes like good work, shared progress, and avoiding conflict.  The passage stresses that knowing someone's circumstances (even if you don't know *why* they are that way) allows you to relate to them and build positive connections.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kokitisa kobanga ya mbongwana** (Preventing conflict) - While understanding *can* help prevent conflict, the text focuses more on the positive creation of relationships, not just avoiding the negative.
* **C: Kozua esika ya kobika na kati ya lisanga** (Finding a place to fit within society) - This is a *result* of good relationships, not the core purpose of understanding others.
* **D: Kokolisa bizaleli ya kimombongo** (Strengthening familial relationships) - The text talks about relationships generally, not specifically familial ones. It’s broader than just family.



Therefore, **B** best encapsulates the central message of the passage – that understanding another person’s situation fosters good relationships, and those relationships are the foundation for a thriving community."
Na maloba mae malandi ya wapi elimboli malamu mayele ya koyekola oyo ebengami postmoderne?,"The correct answer is **B: Koyekola esengelaki kotalela mingi mingi biloko oyo tondimi ete tokomona yango kokokisama.**

Here's why:

* **The passage argues that postmodern imitation is pervasive.** It states that everything we see on TV is an imitation, and that people are imitating things they see in movies, leading to a lack of originality.  Option B directly reflects this idea – that imitation requires a lot of referencing to things we *think* we see.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A & C: ""Balolenge misusu ya koyekola ezali na litomba koleka misusu"" / ""Balolenge misusu ya koyekola ezali malamu koleka misusu""** - These are very vague and don’t specifically address *why* the passage considers this postmodern imitation problematic. They simply state there are other forms of imitation.
* **D: ""Biloko ya mobimba ezalaka te na ngonga ya boyekoli""** - This translates to ""Things of imitation are not in the eye of the imitator."" This is not the central argument of the passage. The passage isn't saying people don't realize they are imitating; it’s saying the imitation is constant and leading to a loss of authenticity.



The passage emphasizes the *sheer volume* of imitation and how it's become ingrained in modern life through media, which option B captures best."
Maloba nini na mae malandi elimboli malamu te mayele ya koyekola oyo ebengami post modern learning approach ?,"The correct answer is **C: Lolenge ya koyekola etalaka mingi moyekoli mpe malakisi oyo ezali kopesama.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a postmodern learning approach.** It highlights how learning is fragmented, comes from many sources (like TV), and is often disconnected from real-life consequences.  It talks about mimicking things seen without understanding their meaning or ethics (like the examples of building fountains, copying styles, or gossiping).  This is a key characteristic of postmodern thought – a focus on subjectivity, simulation, and the breakdown of traditional authority.
* **Option C directly reflects this.** It states that the learning method *emphasizes the learner and the information being received.*  Postmodern learning isn't about a teacher imparting knowledge; it's about the individual constructing their own understanding from a flood of information, often without critical evaluation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lolenge ya koyekola bansango ezali ebele.** (The learning method of the environment is simple) – The passage doesn't say the environment's learning is simple; it describes a *complex* and often problematic learning environment filled with unfiltered information.
* **B: Balolenge misusu ya koyekola esengeli kosalema mingi mingi koleka misusu.** (Other learning methods should be used more often than others) – The passage doesn’t suggest diversifying learning methods, it criticizes *how* learning is happening.
* **D: Malakisi oyo tokoki te kosalela yango mokolo moko ezali na litomba koyekola.** (Skills that we cannot use today are in the learning process) –  This doesn’t capture the core issue – the passage is about *how* skills are learned, not *which* skills are learned.

"Sima ya kolamuka yomoko na ngonga ya pongi, nini na mae malandi ekoki kosala eloko somgolo pakala na eteni ya bokati pongi?","The correct answer is **B: Kokende na toilete mpe kozonga na mbeto mbala moko** (Go to the toilet and get back to bed).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically mentions:** ""...Soki otie te horloge na esika ya malamu ntango olali, ekoki kozala na songe mosusu ya chambre, pe ekosenga yo otelema na mbeto mpona kokanga yango.""  This translates to: ""If you wake up during the night, it could be a desire to use the bathroom, and it might require you to get up and go back to bed.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kotanga pona ngonga moko na ndambu liboso ya kozonga na pongi:**  The passage doesn't suggest preparing for a specific round of sleep.
* **C: Koboma alarme nayo mpe kolala sima ya ngonga tukumibale:** The passage suggests *avoiding* a loud alarm if possible.
* **D: Kolamuka komela mai na molangi pembeni ya mbeto nayo:** While the passage mentions biorhythms and waking up to go to the bathroom, it doesn't suggest getting up and staying awake next to your bed.



"
Nini na mae malandi ekokani te na bolimboli ya kokata pongi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ekoki kolandana na biorhythme** (It can be related to your biorhythm).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Maponi mosusu oyo euti na biorythme esengaka komela mai mingi...liboso ya kolala, yango esengaka kotelema mpona kokende kosuba."" (Other factors that are related to biorhythm require a lot of attention...before sleep, it is necessary to pay attention to it so you don't struggle to fall asleep).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Litomba ezali ya komilamusa yomoko mobimba** (The time is to wake up very early) - The passage focuses on *falling* asleep, not waking up.
* **C: Esalemaka na ngonga nayo ya kolala mikolo nyonso** (It happens with your habit of sleeping every day) - While habits play a role in sleep, the passage doesn't emphasize this as a hindering factor.
* **D: Sima ya kolamuka litomba ezali ya kolala lisusu sima ya bangonga mibale to deux heures du temps** (The time to wake up is to sleep again after several or two hours) - This is a misinterpretation of the passage, which describes a period of trying to fall back asleep *after* being disturbed.



"
"Na tango boongo ezali komeka kozua ba ndoto ya malamu mingi mingi, nini ebakisamaka?","The correct answer is **A: Ba REM**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ntina monene oyo likambo wana esalemaka ezali bandolo ya solo oyo ebakisaka molai ya ngonga kati na **REM**."" (The main point of what's being said is that it's the role of the brain that causes dreams during **REM** sleep.)  The passage then goes on to describe the experiences *during* REM sleep – vivid dreams, physical sensations, etc.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nivo ya makasi (High level of stress):** While stress can *influence* dreams, the passage identifies REM sleep as the *cause* of the vivid dreams.
* **C: Bowumeli pona kolamuka (Ability to wake up):**  The passage mentions difficulty waking up *from* dreams, but doesn't say the ability to wake up *causes* them.
* **D: Ngonga ya lolenge ya REM (REM sleep stage):** This is close, but ""Ba REM"" (REM periods/phases) is more direct and accurately reflects what the passage identifies as being responsible.



"
Kozala na ba ndoto ya malamu ebele ekoki kosala nini na nzoto?,"The correct answer is **A: Kokitisa ngonga kati ya ba REM**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...ntina monene oyo likambo wana esalemaka ezali bandolo ya solo oyo ebakisaka molai ya ngonga kati na REM."" (The main point of what's being said is that it's the activity of the brain that causes dreams during REM sleep).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kokitisa ba REM butu moko na moko** - While REM sleep is important, the passage focuses on *brain activity within* REM, not just the REM stage itself.
* **C: Kotalela mingi bandoto ya malamu** - This describes a result of the brain activity, not the cause.
* **D: Komatisa ba REM butu moko moko** -  ""Komatisa"" (to stop) is the opposite of what causes dreams.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, ekipe ya komonana na ekipe ya komonana te ekokani lolenge nini?","The correct answer is **C: Nyonso mibale bapesaka raport na lisanga ya bakambi moko oyo emonanaka te.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ekipe oyo ezomonana te etiaka mibeko mpona moto mokomoko."" (Teams that don't meet regularly lack important individual accountability.)  It then connects this to the idea of a ""solo team"" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989) and virtual teams where everyone reports to a single leader. This highlights that in teams that *don't* meet, accountability is often channeled *through* a single leader and reporting becomes crucial.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nyonso mibale esengeli kosala mosala lolenge moko:** The passage doesn't say all tasks need to be done the same way. It focuses on *accountability* and *reporting*.
* **B: Nyonso mibale ezali na lolenge na yango kosala misala ya mokolo na mokolo:** The passage doesn't discuss daily tasks or routines.
* **D: Nyonso mibale esalaka na ngonga moko:** While a single leader is mentioned in connection to non-meeting teams, this isn't the core difference outlined.  The core difference is *how* accountability is managed.



"
"Kolanda malaoba wana, maloba nini ezali ya solo te na mae matali ekipe yakomonana te na ya komonana?","The correct answer is **C: Baekipe ya komonana ezalaka na lolenge ya kosala yango moko mukie oyo ekokani te na balisanga ya mosika.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a ""solo team"" (a team that doesn't truly function as a team) as being focused on individual tasks and lacking collaboration.**  Option C directly reflects this – a team that operates with each member doing their own thing, unable to rely on each other's skills.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Baekipe ya komonana ezuamaka na litomba mingi** (A functioning team has a lot of conflict) - The passage doesn't focus on conflict *within* a functioning team, but rather the *absence* of teamwork in a ""solo team.""
* **B: Baekipe ya mosika ezuamaka lokola esika ya bokutani pona baekipe ya komonana** (A virtual team acts as a gathering place for a functioning team) - The passage mentions virtual teams, but not in a way that suggests they *are* functional teams, or a place where they gather.  It just points out the ""solo team"" can also *be* a virtual team.
* **D: Mbongwana ya bangonga ekoki kozala malamu pona baekipe ya komonana te** (Lack of skills can be detrimental to a functioning team) - While true, this isn't the main point the passage is making about the difference between a ""solo team"" and a truly collaborative team.  The passage is about the *lack of interaction and reliance* between members, not necessarily a lack of skills.



"
Nini na mae malandi ezali te eloko oyo mateya ya bolukiluki etalelaka?,"The correct answer is **C: Bamposa ya kati**.

Here's why:

The passage describes Mateya (likely referring to motivation theory) focusing on what *drives* people – their needs and desires. It specifically mentions Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory, both of which deal with **intrinsic motivation** – things people want for their own sake, not just for external rewards. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bamposa ya sika oyo ekokisamaka na kimokolo (Financial incentives that can be achieved in a day):** This is about *extrinsic* motivation, a quick reward. Mateya's focus is on deeper, more lasting motivations.
* **B: Lolenge nini esika ya kofanda ebongolaka bizaleli ya moto (How the place of work affects a person's life):** While important, this is about the *environment* affecting motivation, not the motivation itself.
* **D: Kososola oyo bato balingaka (Things people like to do):**  This is too broad. Motivation isn't just about liking something; it's about underlying *needs* that drive behavior.

**Bamposa ya kati (Intrinsic motivation)** – the internal drive and satisfaction people get from doing something – is the core element Mateya is addressing, as evidenced by the mention of Maslow and Herzberg.  These theories are *all* about understanding those internal needs and motivations.



"
Kati na mae malandi nini oyo ezali te elongo na rule of third?,"The correct answer is **C: Kobatela sujet na esika moko mpe ya malamu** (Place the subject in one place and in the center).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a common photography mistake:** placing the subject directly in the center of the frame, leading to a static and uninteresting composition.  It highlights that a better approach involves using the ""rule of thirds.""

* **The question (Q) asks what *isn't* part of the rule of thirds.**  The rule of thirds intentionally avoids centering the subject.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kosala esika malamu oyo sujet ekofanda (Create a comfortable place for the subject):** This is good general photography advice but doesn't relate to the rule of thirds.
* **B: Kosala bomoi mpe energie na kati ya foto (Create life and energy within the photo):** The rule of thirds *helps* create life and energy, but isn't the definition of what it is.
* **D: Kotiya bosembo kati ya foto (Create symmetry in the photo):** Symmetry is a different compositional technique and often *contradicts* the rule of thirds.



Therefore, **C** accurately identifies something you *shouldn't* do when applying the rule of thirds."
Nini na mae malandi ekoki te kolimbola format 35mm ya foto ?,"The correct answer is **D: Ezali format oyo eyebani na mokili mobimba** (It is the format that corresponds to a standard size).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Na ndakisa, bafoto eninganaka te oyo eza mingi na mokili eza 35mm..."" (For example, the most common photos are in 35mm size...). This establishes 35mm as a standard, widely used format.
* **The passage details the dimensions:** 36mm x 24mm, and the aspect ratio 3:2. This reinforces it as a defined, standard size.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ezali kaka na production** (It is only in production) - While 35mm film *was* produced, the format itself isn't *defined* by its production. It's the size and aspect ratio.
* **B: Endimamaki na apareil ya foto** (It is found in photo equipment) -  The format is *used* in photo equipment, but doesn't *define* it. The equipment is designed *for* the format.
* **C: Ezali na talo ya bokeseni koleka ba formats ebele** (It is in the history alongside older formats) - The passage focuses on its present relevance and dimensions, not its historical place.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, lolenge basali bazali komatisa qualite yakosala ba camera digital, lolenge nini zoom ekomi malamu?","The correct answer is **C: Bafoto nabango ekokani na botalatala ya point focal fixe.**

Here's why:

The text explains that cameras with zoom often sacrifice image quality, especially in low light. It contrasts this with cameras that have a fixed focal length (point focal fixe), stating those can produce better photos even with zoom. The text specifically mentions that zoomed photos can become blurry (nabango) and that fixed focal length cameras avoid this problem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ezali na vitesi ya botalatala:** While speed is important, the text focuses on *quality* being compromised by zoom, not speed.
*   **B: Ezali pete pona kosalela na mwinda ya makasi te:** The text actually says zoom cameras struggle *in* low light.
*   **D: Ezali na makambo ebele te ya point focal lokola bitalatala ya malamu mingi:** The text suggests fixed focal length cameras *do* have advantages over zoom in terms of quality.



"
"Kolanda bansango ya maloba wana, ngonga nini camera ya zoom ekoki kolingama koleka camera fixe?","The correct answer is **A: Soki aperture ya malamu mingi ezali ya litomba** (If a larger aperture is available).

Here's why, based on the provided text:

The text explains that zoom lenses struggle in low light. This is because they often have *smaller* maximum apertures (higher f-numbers) compared to fixed lenses.  A larger aperture (smaller f-number) lets in more light, which is crucial in low-light situations. The text mentions needing to use flash more often with zoom lenses *because* they don't gather enough light naturally.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Soki olingi bisaleli ya zoom muke** (If you like the zoom feature) - This is subjective and doesn’t address a technical advantage.
* **C: Soki olongi te kosalela flash na esika ya molili** (If you don’t want to use flash in dark places) -  This is a consequence of the zoom lens’s limitations, not an advantage.  The text says you *need* to use flash more often *because* of the zoom.
* **D: Soki ozali koluka biloko ebele ya point focal** (If you are looking at things before the focal point) - This is related to focusing, not a fundamental difference between zoom and fixed lenses.



Therefore, the key advantage a zoom lens needs to overcome its low-light disadvantage is a large aperture."
Na mae malandi nini ekoki te kozala bolimboli ya solo ya Mysticisme?,"The correct answer is **A: Molende ezali makasi na mae matali kozala na esengo mpe kimia na makanisi.**

Here's why:

* **The passage defines mysticism as a seeking of a single truth, God, or a transcendent reality.**  It emphasizes personal experience and connection.  A core tenet is *moving beyond* rational understanding and embracing intuition, feeling, and spiritual insight.
* **Option A** (""Skepticism is strong in areas that are based on feeling and reasoning"") directly contradicts this.  Mysticism *relies* on feeling and intuition, and actively moves *away* from purely logical reasoning. Skepticism would be a hindrance, not a component.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:**  The passage mentions seeking a transcendent reality (""bosolo ya kimolimo""), so the ability to perceive it isn't a barrier, but a goal.
* **C:**  The passage implies a connection with a divine power, so the ability to feel connected to the divine isn't a problem.
* **D:**  Mysticism often *involves* personal experience and can be deepened by sharing with others.  The passage suggests a reliance on individual spiritual journeys.



Therefore, skepticism (A) is the most logical element that would *prevent* someone from engaging in or experiencing mysticism as defined in the passage."
"Kolanda maloba wana,nini na mae malandi ezali te motuya ya Mysticisme ?","The correct answer is **D: Kolinga kozala na mayele ya koyeba Nzambe** (Desiring to be in a state of experiencing God).

Here's why:

* **The passage defines mysticism** as a seeking of connection with a single reality - God, the divine, or a single truth. It's about a direct, personal experience of the divine.  Option D directly reflects this core idea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Koluka bososoli na makambo ya kibonzambe** (Looking for solutions in religious things) - While mysticism *can* be religious, it's not primarily about finding *solutions* but about *experiencing* the divine.
* **B: Koluka kososola na nzela ya ba experiences na basusu** (Looking to follow the experiences of others) - Mysticism emphasizes *personal* experience, not just adopting the experiences of others.
* **C: Molende na mae matali kozala na esengo mingi na kati ya makanisi** (Being content with great confusion among thoughts) -  Mysticism seeks clarity and connection, not just to dwell in confusion, even if the path is mysterious.



"
"Kolanada maloba wana, lnani akokaki kobanda lisanga ya baloni bilanga?","The correct answer is **B: Moriori kouta Chatham Islands**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""bilembeteli ya sika emonisi ete Moriori ezalaki etuluku oyo ezalaka na mabele ya Maori oyo balongwaki na Nouvelle-Zelande mpe bakendaki na bisanga ya Chatham...""  This translates to ""recent evidence shows that the Moriori were a group that was originally with the Maori who migrated to New Zealand and ended up on the Chatham Islands...""

Therefore, the Moriori originated *from* the Chatham Islands, after being separated from the main Maori migration to New Zealand.  The text explicitly says they were driven to the Chatham Islands.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Moriori kouta Nouvelle Zeland:** The text indicates they *left* New Zealand (were pushed to the Chatham Islands) not originated from there.
*   **C: Bato ya Maori kouta Polynesie:** While true, the question asks where the Moriori came from.
*   **D: Bato ya Maori kouta Mainland:** This refers to the initial Maori migration, not the origin of the Moriori.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, lisanga oyo ebundisaki Bamaos bazalaki bato ya yambo kobika na esika nini ?","The correct answer is **D: Polynesia**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""makanisi oyo elobaka ete bato ya Maori bautaki na Polynésie na masuwa moko ya monene..."" This translates to ""research shows that the Maori originated in Polynesia...""

Therefore, according to the text, the Maori originally came from Polynesia. While they *ended up* in New Zealand and interacted with the Moriori on the Chatham Islands, Polynesia is their place of origin.



"
Na lolenge nini bosaleli ya Pureland method ya origami epesi litomba na mazita?,"The correct answer is **A: Mazita elingaka kosala bamizita ebele mbala moko** (The method allows people to create multiple copies at once).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Origami Pureland eza origami moko oyo eza na bipekiseli oyo kaka bakoki kokanga kaka lizita moko na mbala moko..."" (Pureland Origami is a technique where you can only fold one unit at a time...)  This directly implies the *benefit* is being able to produce *many* units from that single fold.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mosali lizita esali ete mayele ya kosalela moto ekoba makasi** (The method makes it easier for people to find good work or avoid trouble) - The passage talks about John Smith helping people find work *or* avoid trouble, but this isn't a description of the origami method itself.
* **C: Mosali lizita ezali kosala origami oyo esengi kozala na lizita pona kokanga** (The method is for making origami that needs to be folded for a purpose) - The passage doesn't state *why* people are folding origami, just that Smith used it as a tool.
* **D: Mosali lizita asi ameki yango kaka mbala moko to mbala mibale** (The method only takes one or a few tries) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
Na mae malandi nini oyo elimboli malamu te Pureland Origami?,"The correct answer is **A: Ezali pona basalimazita oyo bazali na boyebi makasi** (It is for people to forget the names they know).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Origami Pureland eza origami moko oyo eza na bipekiseli oyo kaka bakoki kokanga kaka lizita moko na mbala moko, mazita ya mpasi neti mazita oyo ebaluka epesami te ndingisa pe mazita mingi ezalaka na bisika ya pete.""  This translates to ""Pureland Origami is a type of origami with the rule that you can only fold one name at a time, forgetting past names and many names are hidden in the dark.""
* **John Smith's story:** He used it to help people forget bad experiences or things they didn't want to remember.

Therefore, the core purpose of Pureland Origami, as described in the passage, is about *forgetting* names and past experiences – helping people let go.  Option A accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Method wana ezalaka te na mazita yakokanga:** (This method doesn't have names to fold) - The passage explicitly says names *are* folded, one at a time.
* **C: Mazita esengeli kozala na bisika ya kozala semba:** (Names must be in the dark to be remembered) - The passage states names are in the *dark* (hidden), not to be remembered.
* **D: Ezali method ya malamu pona basali mazita oyo bazali na mayele ebele te pona kosalela moto:** (It is a good method for people to keep names they easily forget and use for a person) - This is the opposite of what the passage describes; it’s about *forgetting*, not keeping.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, esika nini oyo elandani te na civilization Indus Valley ?","The correct answer is **B: The Sarasvati River**.

Here's why:

The text states that some scholars believe the civilization extended to the dried-up riverbeds of the Sarasvati River.  However, it also notes there's debate whether to call it the Indus-Sarasvati civilization *because* of this extension, and some prefer ""Harappan"" civilization. This implies the Sarasvati River is a point of contention regarding the civilization's boundaries and even its name.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Harappa:** Harappa is a city *within* the Indus Valley Civilization and its namesake, not a location outside of it.
*   **C: Bisika ya nordi ya Afghanistan:** The text states the civilization extended into the *north-east* of Afghanistan, not the north.
*   **D: Most of modern-day Pakistan:** The text explicitly states the civilization *included* most of modern-day Pakistan.



"
Kombo nini oyo ekoki te kozala kombo ya Civilization ya Mbula ya Bronze lolenge elobami na maloba wana,"The correct answer is **A: The Harappan Civilization**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that some people call the civilization ""the Harappan civilization"" *because* of the site of Harappa, where the first discoveries were made in 1920.  It also mentions ""Civilisation ya Indus-Sarasvati"" as an alternative name, and ""Civilisation ya Indus Valley"" which is synonymous with the first. Thus, the Harappan Civilization is a name *for* the civilization, not something that wouldn't be a name for it.

Let's look at why the others are incorrect:

* **B: Indus-Sarasvati Civilization:** The text *mentions* this name as a possibility, meaning it *is* a name for the civilization.
* **C: The Indus River Civilization:**  The passage directly links the civilization to the Indus River (""Lisanga ya bato ya lobwaku ya Indus..."").
* **D: The Indus Valley Civilization:** This is very similar to the Indus River Civilization and is also referenced in the text.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi epesaka litomba ya ngonga molai?","The correct answer is **A: Koyokana na basusu** (To associate with peers).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Bato mingi bakoyeba ete liponi na bango ya malamu ya ntango molai eza ya kosala elongo na basusu."" This translates to: ""Many people believe that their good relationships during their youth help them build connections with others.""  This directly implies that strong relationships with peers contribute to a good reputation and connections later in life.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kotiya litomba nayomoko liboso:** (To keep a secret again) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Kotiya molende na oyo ekosalisa bato ebele na esika ya bato mukie:** (To show kindness to those who help people in important places) - This is a general act of kindness and doesn't relate to building a good reputation from youth.
* **D: Koyeba ete lokoso ekoki kozala na litomba:** (To know that reputation can be in secret) -  The passage isn't about secrecy, but about the positive impact of early relationships.



Therefore, **A** best reflects the core message of the passage regarding what contributes to a good reputation later in life – fostering strong connections with peers during youth."
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini oyo moto akoki kotalela lokola eloko ya motuya mingi soki mposa naye ezali ya kozua litomba nokinoki?","The correct answer is **A: Kozanga kimoimi** (To have patience).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses the difficulties of maintaining relationships when people are stressed and overwhelmed.** It points out that people often blame past experiences for present problems.
* **The question (Q) asks what a person can *do* to avoid conflict when they feel the urge to blame.**
* **Patience (kozanga kimoimi)** is the most appropriate response.  If you are patient, you are less likely to react impulsively and blame others.  It allows time for understanding and a more reasoned response.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Kosalela elongo nabasuu (Talking to others):** While communication is important, it doesn't directly address the *impulse to blame* in the moment.
* **C: Boyokani (Forgiveness):** Forgiveness is important *after* understanding, but doesn't prevent the initial blaming reaction.
* **D: Kozanga kimoimi (To have patience):** This is a duplicate of A and therefore the correct answer.



Therefore, **A: Kozanga kimoimi** is the best answer because it tackles the root of the problem - reacting emotionally and blaming others."
"Kolanda maloba wana, nani afutaki mbongo ebele ya Bitumba?","The correct answer is **B: Wall Street banks**.

Here's why:

The passage states the US colonial administration facilitated the transfer of Philippine lands to *Wall Street banks* in exchange for debts. This means the banks were the ones ultimately benefiting financially from the situation, effectively ""taking the money"" from the Philippines.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bayangeli ya mboka Phillipines (Philippine officials):** While they may have been involved in the process, the passage indicates they were acting under the influence and for the benefit of the US colonial power and the banks.
* **C: Bakonzi ya Mboka Amerika (American colonial authorities):** They *facilitated* the transfer but didn't directly receive the money. They acted on behalf of US interests which included Wall Street.
* **D: Bato ya Mboka Phillipines (Philippine people):**  The passage explicitly states they were exploited and lost their lands, meaning they were *losing* money, not taking it.



"
Tango nini eyaki liboso ya mbula Templiers?,"The correct answer is **C: Bileko ya moyen age ya kati** (The High Middle Ages).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mbula oyo makambo wana esalemaki, babengaka yango mbala mingi Moyen Age ya Likolo..."" (The time when these things happened, they often called it the High Middle Ages...)
* **The passage further clarifies:** The High Middle Ages were the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bileko ya suka ya moyen age:** This is too broad – it just means the end of the Middle Ages.
* **B: Ekeke to siecle ya 12:**  While the Templars *existed* in the 12th century, their period wasn’t *limited* to just that century.
* **D: Ekeke ya 13:** Similar to B, the 13th century was *part* of their time, but not the whole picture.



"
Tango nini nde eyaki yambo sima ya mbula ya baTempliers?,"The correct answer is **C: Bileko ya moyen age ya likolo** (High Middle Ages).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mbula oyo makambo wana esalemaki, babengaka yango mbala mingi Moyen Age ya Likolo, eleko ya lisolo ya Erope na ekeke ya 11, 12, 13 (1000–1300 ya ntango na biso).""  This directly links the time of the Templars to the High Middle Ages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bileko ya suka ya moyen age** (Early Middle Ages) - The passage specifically references the *High* Middle Ages, not the Early Middle Ages.
* **B: Ekeke to siecle ya 12** (12th century) - While the 12th century *was* part of the time period, it doesn't encompass the entire period the Templars existed.
* **D: Ekeke ya 11** (11th century) - Similar to B, the 11th century is only a portion of their active time.



"
Lolenge nini ya kobikisa to lolenge ya minganga kosala oyo elobami te kosalema na minganga na tango ya Kibokonzi ya Roma?,"The correct answer is **D: Kokata makolo pona kobikisa babeli ya bagangrenes** (Amputating limbs to stop the spread of gangrene).

Here's why:

* **The text specifically states:** ""Bayebaki malamu kokata makolo mpona kobikisa bato ya maladi na maladi ya gangrène..."" (They readily amputated limbs to stop the spread of disease like gangrene...). This directly answers the question of a practice we wouldn't readily perform today.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kopesa bato kisi pona kozanga kimia koleka na nzela ya bakisi Sedative** (Giving patients opium for pain relief via sedatives) - While they *did* use opium (and morphine derived from it) for pain relief, this is a practice still used today, albeit with more refined methods and understanding.
* **B: Kosalela bambuma ya herbane pona scopolamine** (Using henbane plants for scopolamine) -  They *did* use henbane, and it contains scopolamine.  Using plant-based medicines isn't inherently something we wouldn't do today.
* **C: Kosala makila eleka na misisa** (Performing surgery) - Surgery was practiced in Roman times, and is obviously still practiced today.

"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini elobami te kozala na kati ya makambo ya bokolisi ya kimonganga oyo esalemaki na tango ya Bokonzi ya Baroma ?","The correct answer is **A: Lolenge ya kozala ya lisanga ya baminganga (The possibility of being a training ground for doctors)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage highlights that Roman emperors, like Auguste, *employed* doctors and established systems for their practice.** They even provided them with access to powerful drugs.
* **The text details the gruesome and often experimental procedures doctors performed.** This suggests the army served as a place where doctors could *learn and practice* (often on patients with very severe conditions).
* **The passage explicitly states the doctors gained significant experience from the cases they handled.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Matta ya Basoda ya Bokonzi wana (Matters of the Soldiers of the Empire):** While soldiers *were* patients, the focus is on what this meant for the *doctors*, not solely on the soldiers' wellbeing.
* **C: Lolenge ya kozala ya balopitalo pona koyekola (The possibility of being hospitals for treatment):** While treatment happened, the passage emphasizes the *experimental* nature and the severity of cases, implying it wasn't a standardized hospital system.
* **D: Lolenge Mokonzi azalaki kotiya minganga na mosala (The possibility the Emperor was employing doctors in work):** This is true, but it doesn’t explain *why* the emperors employed them in this context – the passage suggests it was for their training and development.



"
Makoki pona komona etali eloko nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Biteni ya nzoto oyo esungaka emoneli** (The ability of the eye that allows seeing).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly discusses the complexities of sight.** It talks about how light enters the eye, is focused, and how various factors (like lens problems, degree issues) can affect clarity.  This all relates to the *ability* to see.
* **Let's look at why the other options are wrong:**
    * **B: Bosenga ya nzoto (Eye problems)** - The passage *mentions* problems, but it's not *about* the problems themselves, but the ability to see *despite* potential problems.
    * **C: Koyeba koyokela bamolai ya ba onde (Knowing how to adjust to waves of light)** - While light waves are involved, the passage is broader than just adjustment.
    * **D: Mbongwana ya ba degree ya acuity (The measure of degree acuity)** - Acuity is *a part* of sight, but the passage is talking about the overall capability of vision, not just sharpness.



Therefore, option A best captures the main topic of the passage - the ability of the eye to see."
Mbongwana na biteni ya miso na kati ya baoraganismes ya nzoto etalelaka nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Kimolai ya koyokela baondes** (The ability to recognize odors).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** describes the complex process of smell - how molecules enter the nose, interact with receptors, and the brain interprets these signals.  It highlights the specificity of these receptors (each responding to a particular molecule) and the need for various factors (concentration, other smells, individual differences) for proper detection.
* **This directly relates to the ability to detect and recognize odors.** The passage explains *how* we smell, which is fundamentally about recognizing different smells.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bosengi ya Nzoto to organismes (The structure of organisms):** The passage doesn't focus on the physical structure of organisms, but on a specific sense.
* **C: Nivo to kimolai ya acuity (Level of acuity):** While acuity (sharpness of perception) is related, the passage primarily explains *what* is being perceived (smells) not *how well* it's perceived.
* **D: Mikakatano ya Nzoto (Conflicts of organisms):**  This is completely unrelated to the passage's content.

"Kolanda maloba wana, maloba nini pona mae matali bondimi ya Sikhisme elimboli yango malamu te?","The correct answer is **A: Sikhisme ebotamaki kouta bokabwani kati na Kibokoko ya Hindu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ebandaki na etuka ya Pendjab na ekeke ya 15 na bokabwani oyo esalemaki na lingomba ya Hindu."" (It originated in the Punjab region in the 15th century from the context of Hinduism.) This directly supports the idea that Sikhism *emerged from* within Hinduism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Guru eza likambo ya ntina mingi mpona Sikhisme** (Guru is an important concept within Sikhism): While true, the passage states Guru is important in *all* Indian religions, not just Sikhism, making it a less specific answer to the question of what *distinguishes* Sikhism.
* **C: Baguru libwa balandaki sima ya mozalisi ya lingomba, Guru Nanak** (Several Gurus followed the founder of the religion, Guru Nanak): This is factual, but doesn't explain what sets Sikhism apart.
* **D: Mimesano misusu ya Sikhisme eutaki na Hinduismes** (Other aspects of Sikhism originate in Hinduism): The passage mentions similarities, but focuses on Sikhism's *origin* in Hinduism, not just a sharing of aspects.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini ezali lokola eloko ya motuya mingi na lingomba ya Sikhisme ?","The correct answer is **A: Liteya ya Guru**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Guru eza likambo ya ntina mingi mpona bangomba nyonso ya Inde kasi na Sikhisme eza ndimbola oyo esala ete ezala moboko ya bindimeli na bango."" (Guru is a very important concept compared to all other religions of India, and in Sikhism, it is a principle that allows it to be a separate religion). It also mentions that Sikhism began with Guru Nanak.  Therefore, the concept of the Guru is central and uniquely important to Sikhism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kibokoko ya Hindu:** The text says Sikhs are *distinct* from Hinduism, even while acknowledging roots there.
* **C: Koboya kondima mangomba misusu ya Inde:** The text doesn't emphasize a rejection of other Indian religions, but rather a separate identity.
* **D: Kosolola lokota ya Punjabi:** While Punjabi is important as the language of Gurmat, the *concept* of the Guru is more fundamental to the religion itself.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, bana oyo bazali na bokono ya kozanga kotia likebi bazalaka na mikakatano pona kotiya likebi na nini?","The correct answer is **C: Kotala ba desin anime**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""...bana oyo babelaka TDA bakokaka te kotia makanisi esika moko na makambo neti misala ya kelasi, kasi batiaka makanisi esika moko na makambo basepelaka na yango na ndakisa kosakana to kotala badessin anime oyo balingaka mingi...""

This translates to: ""...children with ADHD cannot focus on things like classroom examples, but they *do* focus on things related to drawing and anime they like a lot...""

Therefore, the distraction for these children, preventing them from focusing on learning, is their fascination with anime.



"
"Kolanada maloba wana, pona nini bana ya Maladi ya kozanga kotia likebi balingaka kozala na bizaleli ya makama?","The correct answer is **A: Kokitisa kozala na misala ebele** (To put them in difficult situations).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bana oyo babelaka TDA bakokaka te kotia makanisi esika moko na makambo neti misala ya kelasi, kasi batiaka makanisi esika moko na makambo basepelaka na yango na ndakisa kosakana to kotala badessin anime oyo balingaka mingi to kokoma ba phrase kozanga kosalela bilembo ya kopema."" This translates to: ""Children with ADHD cannot concentrate on one thing like classroom tasks, but they concentrate on things they like, like drawing or watching anime or repeating phrases related to coping.""  And further, ""...bazalaka na bizaleli ya mabe, babundaka, mpe batosaka te bokonzi"" - ""...they are in difficult situations, they fail, and they do not respect authority.""

This indicates the children struggle with focusing on *appropriate* tasks and excel at things that are stimulating but potentially problematic, leading to difficulties and bad situations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kosunga bango bayokana na baninga:** (To keep them away from peers) - The passage doesn't mention isolating them.
* **C: Kosala ete baboti batalaka bango malamu:** (To make sure they start well) - The passage describes existing problems, not preventative measures.
* **D: Kolamusa Boongo nabango:** (To teach them language) - While language difficulties are mentioned (""bakoki te kopusa boongo na bango esala na ndenge ya malamu""), it's a *result* of their condition, not the reason for their struggles.



"
"Kolanda bansango na maloba wana, na bandakisa mae malandi ndakisa nini oyo ezali ya échafaudages te ?","The correct answer is **A: Tutoriel na ebandeli ya lisano ya ordinatere** (Tutorial on basic computer literacy).

Here's why:

The passage describes scaffolding as a support structure *specifically* for learning how to use computers and software – like a computer program or a work application. It mentions helping students navigate tasks that might be difficult on their own.  A tutorial on basic computer literacy fits this description perfectly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Molakisi ya SAT** (SAT tutor) - While tutoring is a form of support, the passage focuses on *how* to use tools (computers/software), not preparing for a specific test.
* **C: Malengeli ya koyekola ya mutu yemoko** (Individual study guide) - A study guide provides material, but doesn’t necessarily offer the *structured support* (scaffolding) described in the passage.
* **D: Coach ya mukie ya Ligue** (Ligue football coach) - This is completely unrelated to the context of computer learning.



"
Na mae malandi nini elimboli malamu te likambo ya échafaudages ?,"The correct answer is **D: Échafaudages esalemaka pona kopesa lisungi na ebandeli ya boyekoli.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Échafaudage ekendaka mosika koleka...esalisaka pe na kosunga bato oyo bazoyekola makambo ya sika na ndakisa programe ya sika ya ordinatere to ebandeli ya mosala ya sika.""  This translates to ""Scaffolding helps a lot...it also helps support those who are learning things like computer programs or the beginning of work.""  This directly means scaffolding provides support in the initial stages of learning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Échafaudages ekoki kozala na internet** - The passage doesn't mention anything about the internet.
* **B: Ezali mingi lokola lisungi kasi lolenge ya koyekola te** - The passage emphasizes scaffolding *is* for learning.
* **C: Eyebani mpe lokola koyekola na lolenge ya projet** - While scaffolding *can* be used in projects, the passage focuses on its role in foundational learning (like learning software or starting a job).



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, eteni nini ya Myspace ekoki kosalisa moyekoli oyo azali na mikakatano pona kotanga?","The correct answer is **A: Customization**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Ekoki kozala bongisa yango mpo eza pete na kotanga mpe ekoki kozala na couleur mingi to moke ndenge olingi."" which translates to ""It can be customized to be easier to type and can be in many or one color as you like."" This directly points to the ability to customize the profile as a solution for people who have difficulty typing or navigating.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Blogs:** While MySpace *has* blogs, the text doesn't mention them as a solution for typing difficulties.
*   **C: One web address:** The text mentions needing an address, but doesn't present it as a solution for typing issues.
*   **D: 54 million profiles:** This is just a fact about MySpace's size, not a feature helping with typing.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini ezalaki te kati ya biyano ya Krushchev na botomboki ya bato ya mosala","The correct answer is **D: Kondima makambo mosusu ya nkita** (Ignoring other critical issues).

Here's why:

The text states that Khrushchev *didn't* support other critical issues they expected him to address and didn't support Wladyslaw Gomulka who was strongly desired as prime minister. This directly aligns with ""ignoring other critical issues.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kotiya Premier Ministre mosuu:** The text explicitly says Khrushchev *didn't* support Gomulka becoming prime minister.
* **B: Kosalela bashare pona kozongisa molongo:** While he did support shares to calm the situation, the text emphasizes what he *didn't* do.
* **C: Komatisa bokati salere:** He did accept some concessions, but the focus is on his reluctance to address bigger concerns.



"
Na mae malandi nini ezalaki te kati ya bantina ya botomboki na Mboka Pologne?,"The correct answer is **B: Kozanga bilei** (Strikes).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states ""ntango bato basalaki mobulu na Pologne, wana bato ya mosala batombokaki mpona bilei bazalaki kopesa bango mpe bakitisaki salere na bango"" - which translates to ""when people protested in Poland, workers went on strike and demanded better wages."" This indicates strikes were a key element of the unrest.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lisanga ya Kominisme (The Communist System):** While the unrest happened *within* a communist system, the question asks about what was happening *during* the unrest, not the system itself.
* **C: Kokata salere (Demanding wages):** This is *a result* of the strikes, not the event itself.
* **D: Kotiyama ya Wladyslaw Gomulka (The position of Wladyslaw Gomulka):**  Gomulka's position is mentioned as something Khrushchev supported, but isn't the core event happening *during* the unrest.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini esalaki mabe te na boyokani kati ya URSS na USA to Mboka Amerika?","The correct answer is **C: Bokeseni ya lolenge ya kosalaMakambo** (Competition for spheres of influence).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a power struggle between Germany, the USSR, and the USA after WWII.** Germany's defeat created a vacuum, and the USSR and USA competed to fill it.  This competition involved establishing influence in different parts of the world (Africa, Asia, Cuba, Afghanistan).
* **""Lolenge ya kosala makambo""** directly translates to ""spheres of influence,"" which accurately reflects the nature of the conflict described in the text.  Both superpowers were trying to expand their political, economic, and military control over different regions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bokeseni ya kibokoko (Arms race):** While an arms race *was* part of the Cold War, the passage focuses more on the *geographic* spread of influence and control, not just building weapons.
* **B: Bamakanisi na mae matali Mboka Alemagne (Conflicts over German territory):** While Germany was initially central, the conflict quickly expanded *beyond* Germany to global competition.
* **D: Kosuana mpona mae matali lolenge ya kosala misala (Financial competition over spheres of influence):** The passage highlights military bases and soldiers, suggesting it's more than just financial competition.



"
Na mae malandi nini elimboli malamu te litomba ya kotinda basango na bansinga ya boongo na nzoto?,"The correct answer is **C: Kobatela bahoméostasie** (Maintaining homeostasis).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly states:** ""Boongo na biso ebatelaka homéostasie ndenge etindaka basango na bansinga ya boongo na nzoto mpona makila ekoba kotambola pe etambola malamu."" (Our bodies maintain homeostasis in a way that allows organs and body systems to function properly even when conditions are changing.) This establishes homeostasis as the key to good function despite changing conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kosala makila etambola malembe** (Performing regular exercise) - While exercise *contributes* to health, it's not the fundamental principle the passage focuses on.
* **B: Kotalela etamboli ya makila** (Controlling exercise) - Similar to A, this is related to health but not the core concept.
* **D: Kokebisa makama na nzoto** (Adapting to conditions in the environment) - Adaptation is *a result* of homeostasis, not the process itself. Homeostasis *allows* for adaptation.



Therefore, maintaining homeostasis is the underlying mechanism that enables the body to function well despite fluctuations in the environment, as described in the passage."
Nini ekoki kozuama na Plateau ya Giza?,"The correct answer is **D: Piramid ya munene koleka**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Plateau ya Giza... eza na bapiramide mingi (piramide monene eleki nyonso na monene), bankunda mingi ya mike, batempelo mingi, mpe Sphinx monene.""  This means the Plateau of Giza contains *many* pyramids, including the Great Pyramid, as well as tombs, temples, and the Sphinx. 

While options A, B, and C are *also* found at Giza, they are not the defining feature or the most comprehensive answer to what you can find there. The text emphasizes the pyramids themselves.



"
Litomba ya Pyramide ya munene koleka ezalaki nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Kokumisa Faraon** (To bury the Pharaoh).

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

* The text states: ""Piramide monene basalaki yango mpona kokumisa Farao Khufu..."" (The Great Pyramid was built there to bury Pharaoh Khufu...)
* It also mentions the pyramids were generally built to house the deceased Pharaohs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kokoma moko ya bikamwisi sambo ya mokili** (To be one of the wonders of the ancient world) - While true, this is a *result* of its construction, not the *reason* for it.
* **C: Kosalisa neti mabele** (To produce electricity) - The text doesn't mention anything about electricity.
* **D: Kobatela bakunda ya bato oyo bakufa** (To support the tombs of the deceased) - While there are tombs *around* the pyramids, the pyramids themselves were the primary burial places, especially for the Pharaoh.



"
Nani asalaki mayele nabiso ya Arson oyo ebebisaki tempelo?,"The correct answer is **A: The Ephesians**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bato ya Efezo, basilikaki, balobaki ete bakokoma lisusu te nkombo ya Herostratus."" This translates to ""The people of Ephesus were outraged and decided they would not remember the name of Herostratus.""  While Herostratus *committed* the arson, the Ephesians are the ones who actively tried to erase his memory, effectively ""taking ownership"" of the response to the act and the desire to not glorify him.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Alexander the Great:** He offered to rebuild the temple but was refused. He didn't start the fire.
*   **C: Strabo:** He simply recorded the history of the temple and Herostratus's act.
*   **D: Artemis:** Artemis is the goddess the temple was dedicated to; she didn't start the fire.



"
Maloba nini ezali ya solo na mae matali botongi lisusu ya lingomba ya Artemis?,"The correct answer is **B: Etongamaki lisusu sima ya bokonzi ya Alexandre monene (Etongamaki lisusu sima ya bokonzi ya Alexander the Great)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Na nsima ya liwa ya Alexandre batongaki lisusu tempelo na mbula 323 Liboso ya Bantango na Biso."" (After the death of Alexander, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC).  This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Botongisi lisusu efutamaki na Alexander the Great (Rebuilding was initiated by Alexander the Great)** - The text says he *offered* to pay for rebuilding, but it was refused.  He didn't actually start the rebuilding.
* **C: Bapesaki ndingisa na Herostratus ya kofuta pona botongisi lisusu (They vowed revenge on Herostratus for rebuilding)** -  The text says the people of Ephesus *cursed* Herostratus and vowed *not* to remember his name, not that they wanted him to rebuild.
* **D: Etongamaki lisusu na 320 liboso ya bantango nabiso (It was rebuilt in 320 BC)** - The text specifically states 323 BC, not 320 BC.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, tango nini ezalaki nokinoki mingi oyo bikelamu bakokaki kotambola na makolo mibale?","The correct answer is **B: Bambula million mibale eleki**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bato basi batambola ya kotelema banda bamilio mibale ya bambula na kobima ya moto babengi Homo Erectus (elimboli moto ya kotelema).""  This translates to ""These people began walking upright around two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (the upright man).""

Therefore, the time when walking upright became more common is around two million years ago.



"
Na Bikelamu oyo nani abandaki kotambola na makolo mibale na ngonga nyonso?,"The correct answer is **A: Sahelanthropus**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sahelanthropus atambolaki na makolo mibale mibu bamilio nsambo esi eleki.""  This directly translates to ""Sahelanthropus walked on all fours millions of years ago.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Homo Erectus:** The passage says *Homo Erectus* were efficient walkers (bipeds) - not those who walked on all fours.
* **C: Bipedal specializations:** This is a characteristic *of* walking upright, not a creature that walked on all fours.
* **D: Australopithecus:** The passage states *Australopithecus* did *not* walk well.



"
Masuwa ya Alemgne ebandaki komeka kosala nini na tango ya Etumba WWII?,"The correct answer is **A: Kobotola biloko kouta na Grande Britagne** (To cut off supplies to Great Britain).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Soki baninga balongaki te, Allemagne alingaki kobotola Grande Bretagne ndenge abotolaka Eropa mobimba."" (If the blockade wasn't successful, Germany would be able to conquer Great Britain as it conquered much of Europe.)

This directly indicates that the German submarines (masuwa) were attempting to *blockade* (cut off supplies to) Great Britain.  The other options are incorrect because:

* **B:**  Germany was trying to *prevent* Great Britain from receiving supplies, not help them.
* **C:** While the submarines operated in the Atlantic, their *goal* wasn't just to be *in* the Atlantic, but to disrupt shipping.
* **D:** The German submarines were fighting *against* America, not helping them.



"
"Kolanda bansango oyo epesami na maloba wana, nani alongaki makasi na etumba ya mai na Campagne ya Atlantique ya nordi?","The correct answer is **B: Ba Alemans** (The Germans).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Basoda ya Allemagne ya mai, oyo basalelaki mingi bamasuwa, bazalaki koluka kokanga bato nzela."" (German naval soldiers, who used many submarines, were trying to block shipping lanes.)  This clearly indicates the Germans were the main actors actively engaged in submarine warfare during the Battle of the Atlantic.

While the British and Americans were *targets* of the German submarines and worked to counter them, the passage focuses on the *Germans* initiating the attacks with submarines.



"
Na tango ba Asyriens babandaki kosalela Calvary nini ezalaki naino te na tango wana?,"The correct answer is **A: Bifandelo likolo ya punda** (They fought with horsemen/cavalry).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""basoda ya Assirie oyo babundaki likolo ya mpunda bafandaki kaka boye likolo ya bampunda na bitumba."" This directly translates to ""The Assyrian soldiers who had horses fought only with horsemen in battles.""  It explains that when the Assyrians used cavalry, they fought *with* cavalry – meaning horsemen – instead of other types of soldiers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Barbalètes:** These are described as the bars/supports that could break in battle, not what the Assyrians were fighting *with*.
*   **C: Makalo:** This means ""armies"" or ""forces,"" not specifically what they used in combat.
*   **D: Ebundeli:** This means ""group"" or ""assembly,"" also not a specific combat element.



"
Bitumba oyo esalelaka ba cavaliers ebundanaka lolenge nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Likolo ya punda** (Groups of donkeys).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...basoda ya Assirie oyo babundaki likolo ya mpunda bafandaki kaka boye likolo ya bampunda na **bitumba**.""  This translates to ""...the Assyrian soldiers who rode donkeys only fought in **groups** of donkeys.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Makolo polele** (Long hands) - This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **B: Na bibundeli te** (Without formation) - The text implies they *did* have a formation – groups of donkeys.
*   **D: Na mapinga mukie** (On high hills) - The text doesn't mention terrain features like hills.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na esika nini okoki te kokuta moto simple ya Mboka Babylone?","The correct answer is **A: Komema ba mbeka na lopango ya tempelo** (To be a servant in the temple precinct).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bato bazalaki komema bambeka na banzambe..."" (People were employed as servants of the gods...). This directly relates to working *within* the temple complex – the ""lopango ya tempelo.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Kozala na mayangani na tempelo ya mukie** (To be among the high priests in the temple) - The text mentions priests (""banganga-nzambe"") but doesn't suggest a simple person could *become* one.
* **C: Na festival kati ya lopango ya tempelo** (At a festival within the temple precinct) - While festivals happened, being *at* one doesn't define a regular position.
* **D: Komema mbeka na etumbelo ya kati** (To be a servant in the inner sanctuary) - The text describes the inner sanctum as where priests performed rituals, not where general servants would work.



"
Na mae malandi nini oyo ezalaki kaka pona batumbi mbeka,"The correct answer is **A: BaFestivals**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Bato bazalaki komema bambeka na banzambe..."" which translates to ""People used to celebrate with the gods..."" This directly points to festivals as activities specifically for worshipping the gods.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Etumbelo ya kati** - This translates to ""Central offerings"" while offerings might have *been part* of festivals, it's not the overarching activity.
*   **C: Ba mayangani** - This translates to ""Shamans"" or ""Priests"" - these are *people* involved in worship, not the events themselves.
*   **D: Ziggurats** - These are *structures* (temples), not activities. They are where worship happened, but not the worship itself.



"
Na tango nini Mokonzi Tutankhamun azuaki lokumu mpe koyebana ?,"The correct answer is **C: Sima ya komona lilita naye** (After his tomb was discovered).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ndenge bamonaki lilita na ye na 1922 esalaki ete ayebana mingi."" (the way his tomb was discovered in 1922 is what made him famous).  It explicitly links his fame to the discovery of his tomb.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kolanda kimoyibi na lilita naye** (While looting his tomb) - The passage mentions looting happened *after* he became famous, not *before*.
* **B: Na tango ya kibokonzi naye** (At the time of his reign) - The passage says he wasn't well known *during* his reign.
* **D: Sima ya kombo naye kopatama na liste ya mikonzi ya kala** (After his name was added to the list of ancient kings) - While being on lists of kings is part of history, the passage focuses on the tomb discovery as the turning point for his fame.



"
Nini esalaki ete Mokonzi Tutankhamun akoma mokonzi ya Egypte oyo ayebani?,"The correct answer is **C: Kimoyibi ya ba artifacts bankoto na kati ya lilita naye** (The discovery of many artifacts within his tomb).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ndenge bamonaki lilita na ye na 1922 esalaki ete ayebana mingi."" (the way his tomb was discovered in 1922 is what made him famous).  It then elaborates on the incredible treasures found *inside* the tomb. This discovery is what propelled Tutankhamun to prominence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Komonana ya lilita naye oyo bayibaki te** (The discovery of his tomb which wasn't spoiled) - The passage doesn't focus on whether the tomb was spoiled, but *what was found inside* that caused fame.
* **B: Esika naye na liste ya mikonzi ya kala** (His place on the list of ancient kings) - The passage mentions he's one of many kings, but his fame didn't come from simply being *on* a list.
* **D: Litomba naye na tango ya civilization ya Egypte** (His tomb at the time of the Egyptian civilization) - The passage focuses on his *posthumous* fame (after his death and discovery), not his relevance during the civilization.



"
Eloko nini poete ya mboka Grece Homer akokaki te?,"The passage states Homer was a poet who *wrote* (ayebana) a lot, specifically the Iliad and Odyssey. Therefore, the answer is **D: Koloba** (to write).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Koyoka** - To speak
* **B: Komona** - To see
* **C: Kotambola** - To walk/travel



"
Moto nini kouta Grece oyo ayebani makasi libanda ya mosala ya kokoma?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagorus**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Moto ya Grece mosusu oyo ayebana mingi eza moto ya mathematique Pythagore, ayebana mingi mpona makanisi na ye na ntina etali boyokani na kati ya bandambo ya batriangles oyo eza rectangle.""  This directly translates to ""Another Greek figure who is very famous is Pythagoras, very famous for his theories relating to the sides of right-angled triangles.""

While the other options are also mentioned as famous Greeks, Pythagoras is specifically linked to the foundations of geometry and mathematical principles used in measurement and construction (""mosala ya kokoma"" - measurement).



"
Esika nini libota ya Ba Ebele elekisaki ngonga mingi?,"The correct answer is **A: Na Libanda** (In Lebanon).

The passage states: ""Mabota ebele ya Baebele bazalaki kolekisa bomoi na bango **na libanda**."" (The early churches of the Bible were collecting lives in **Lebanon**.)

Therefore, Lebanon is where the early churches were collecting lives, making it the answer to where the churches were most active.



"
Nini oyo ezalaki ya litomba mingi te pona libota ya ba Ebele ?,"The correct answer is **A: Climat nabango** (Their climate).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Na climat ya moto ya Moyen-Orient, ndako ezalaki te ntina mingi."" (In the hot climate of the Middle East, there wasn't much shade). This directly identifies the climate as the difficult factor for the Israelites.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ba depots nabango** (Their stores/depots): While the passage mentions stores being ransacked, it doesn't say this was the *biggest* difficulty.
*   **C: Ba ndako nabango** (Their places/locations): The passage mentions lack of shade (ndako) but doesn't frame this as the primary hardship.
*   **D: Elambeli nabango** (Their journeys):  The passage mentions travel, but the climate is presented as the fundamental challenge *during* those journeys.



"
Na mae malandi nini elimbolami malamu te neti bokeseni kati ya bamboka ya skandinave?,"The correct answer is **C: Kibokoko**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ata mboka mokomoko ezalaki ya 'Scandinavie', ezalaki na **bokeseni mingi na bato**, bakonzi, bizaleli pe lisolo na kati Danemark, Suède, Norvège pe Islande.""

* **Kibokoko** translates to ""politics"" or ""governance"" which directly relates to how the Scandinavian countries were organized and related to each other.
* **Istware ya moko na moko** means ""each country's history"" - too broad.
* **Mabele** means ""borders"" - while relevant to countries, it's not the core of the relationship described.
* **Bato** means ""people"" - while people are *involved* in politics, it's not the relationship *itself*.



"
Nani efandaki na Greenland yambo?,"The correct answer is **A: Bikolo ya ba eskimo** (The Eskimo people).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kasi, atako makambo nyonso oyo amonaki, bikolo ya baEskimo bazalaki kofanda kuna na ntango wana."" (But despite all that happened, the Eskimo people were already living there at that time.)

While Erik the Red later explored and settled parts of Greenland, the text makes it clear that the Eskimo people were there *first*. The other options are mentioned as part of the broader Scandinavian context, but not as the original inhabitants.



"
Lisanga nini ekoki kolinga koliya ya kotelema kozanga bakiti te?,"The correct answer is **C: Mibali ya bozui ya Roma**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""mibali ya bozwi basepelaka kosala feti elongo bamifandelaka mpe bazolia bilei na bango."" This translates to ""poor men were encouraged to make long feasts and were given the means to celebrate their own feasts."" This directly links the poor men (mibali ya bozui) to being able to hold feasts/parties (bilei).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Basi ya bozui ya Roma:**  This translates to ""bases of the poor of Rome"". This isn't mentioned in the text as relating to feasts.
*   **B: Mibali babola ya Roma:** This translates to ""rich men of Rome"". The text focuses on *poor* men being *given* the means to celebrate, not rich men already having the resources.
*   **D: Basi ya babola ya Roma:** This translates to ""bases of the rich of Rome"".  Similar to A, it doesn't relate to the enablement of feasts.



"
Na Mae malandi nini ekoki kozala te kati ya feti ya Roma ya kala?,"The correct answer is **D: Saani ya dendo yakotumba** (Toothpaste).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Na ndakisa, bazalaki na masangu te, batomati, bambala, to cacao..."" This means they didn't have tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, or cacao.  It *implies* they also didn't have modern dental hygiene products like toothpaste.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bapaya babola koliya na bakiti** (They were allowed to eat with their hands) - The passage *supports* this; it says they ate with their hands during feasts.
* **B: Koliya bambembe pona apeti** (Eating pumpkins for dessert) - The passage mentions pumpkins as a food source.
* **C: Mibali ya bozui kolala nase na ngonga ya koliya** (Rich people lying down to eat) - The passage *supports* this; it says rich people reclined while eating.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, kati ya mae malandi nini ekoki kozala na litomba ya molai te?","The correct answer is **B: Libula ya mukie** (Individual freedom).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mbala mingi bizaleli ya bato mike ebungaka kozanga etika bilembeteli na lisolo ya bomoi mpe bato bayebaka yango te lokolo lisanga ya solo ya bato."" This translates to: ""Often the birth of small groups prevents them from establishing a way of life and people don't recognize it as the civilization of individual people.""

This directly implies that *individual freedom* is something that can be lacking in the early stages of civilization and a key component of a developed one.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Libota ya bato (People's needs):** While important, the passage doesn't focus on unmet needs as the core issue.
*   **C: Engumba ya munene (Large city):** The passage mentions cities as *resulting* from civilization, not as something lacking in its development.
*   **D: Libula oyo ezali civilizer (Civilizing freedom):** This is a bit of a contradiction. The passage suggests a lack of freedom *hinders* civilization.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini eyaka yambo ya ekolo?","The correct answer is **A: Libula oyo ezali civilizer** (The lifestyle that civilizes).

Here's why:

The passage states that civilization is about how people live together, organize themselves, and progress. It directly links civilization to a *way of life* (""libula"") that allows for growth and well-being. The passage emphasizes that civilization is more than just individual existence; it's the organized life of a community.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Libula moko kaka** (Just one lifestyle) - This is too simplistic. Civilization isn't just *a* lifestyle, it's a complex one.
* **C: Engumba ya munene** (A large city) - While cities are *part* of civilization, they aren't the definition of it.  The passage mentions ""engumba"" (city/state) but as a component of the broader concept.
* **D: Libula ya mikie mike** (A lifestyle of few people) - The passage explicitly states civilization involves *many* people (""bato mingi mpenza"").



"
Maloba nini na mae matali The Drukgyal Dzong ezali ya solo te?,"The correct answer is **A: Etongamaki pona kosepela bolongi etumba ya mapinaga ya basoda ya Tibetan-Mongol**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Na mobu 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel atongaka ndako ya makasi mpona kokanisa ndenge balongaki basoda ya Tibetain-Mongol."" This directly translates to ""In 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the fortress to commemorate the victory over the Tibetan-Mongol armies.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ezuami na Bhutan:** While the Dzong *is* in Bhutan, the text doesn't state that this is *why* it was built.
* **C: Moto ebebisaki biloko ebele ya ndako:** This refers to an incident in 1951, not the original purpose of the Dzong.
* **D: Esalemaki na Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel:**  He *built* it, but the text focuses on *why* he built it, not just that he was associated with it.



"
Maloba nini elimboli malamu litomba ya moto na Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **A: Eloko moko kaka etikalaki ezali foto ya Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Na 1951, moto moko ezikisaki biloko mingi etikaki kaka mwa biloko moke na Drukgyal Dzong, na ndakisa foto ya Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.""  This directly translates to ""In 1951, one person salvaged many items but only took one item from Drukgyal Dzong, which was a photo of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mapinga ya basoda Tibetan-Mongol balongaki** - The text mentions the fortress was *built* to defend against them, not that their flags were found there after a fire.
* **C: Koyebana mingi nabato ezalaki na mokakatano te** - The text doesn't discuss the number of monks.
* **D: Ebatelamaki na Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal** - While the fortress commemorates him, the text doesn't say he was found there.



"
Na maloba malandi pona Mboka Cambodge nini ezali yasolo?,"The correct answer is **D: Ba Thailandais babebisaki Phnom Phen**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bato ya Thaïlande bakotaki na makasi na Cambodge mbala mingi na ekeke ya 18 mpe na mobu 1772, babomaki Phnom Phen.""  This directly translates to ""Thai troops attacked Cambodia many times in the 18th century and in 1772, they captured Phnom Penh.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ba vietnamien babebisaki Phnom Phen:** The passage states Vietnam *attempted* to annex Cambodia, but doesn't say they captured Phnom Penh.
* **B: Cambodge ekotaki na makasi na mboka Thailand na mbula 1772:** The passage says the *opposite* - Thailand attacked Cambodia in 1772.
* **C: Cambodge ekotelamaki na makasi na mboka Vietnam na ebandali ya ekeke 18:**  The passage says Vietnam tried to annex Cambodia, not that Cambodia attacked Vietnam.



"
Na maloba malandi maloba nini elimboli malamu Bokoti na makasi na mboka Cambodge?,"The correct answer is **B: Ba Thailandais mpe ba Vietnamiens bakotaki na Cambodge na mbula 1772**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bato ya Thaïlande bakotaki na makasi na Cambodge mbala mingi na ekeke ya 18 mpe na mobu 1772, babomaki Phnom Phen."" (Thai forces invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century and in 1772, sacking Phnom Penh.)
* **The passage also states:** ""Na bambula ya suka ya ekeke ya 18 Vietnam ekendaki kobundisa mpe Cambodge."" (Towards the end of the 18th century, Vietnam also began to invade Cambodia.)

Therefore, both Thai and Vietnamese forces invaded Cambodia in 1772.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ba Vietnamiens bakotaki na makasi na Cambodge mbala ebele** - While Vietnam *did* invade, the passage mentions Thailand invaded *multiple* times.
* **C: Ba vietnamien babebisaki Phnom Phen** - The passage says Thai forces sacked Phnom Penh, not Vietnamese.
* **D: Ba Thailandais bakotaki na makasi na Cambodge mbala ebele** - The passage specifies multiple invasions, including one in 1772.



"
Entreprise ya Inde Dutch Est esalaki nini te na tango nabango na Taiwan?,"The correct answer is **B: Mosala ya misala ya kobongola bambuma** (Working on projects to cultivate land).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Na 1624, kompani ya Pays-Bas ya bato ya Inde ya este batiaki ndako na bango na sudi weste ya Taiwan, babandaki misala ya kobongola bambuma..."" which translates to ""In 1624, the Dutch East India Company landed on the southwest of Taiwan, they started projects to cultivate land...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kozala na esika na Southwest ya Esanga** (Being in a location in the Southwest of the Island) - This is *where* they landed, not *what* they did.
*   **C: Kotiya basali kouta Chine na Bilanga nabango** (Hiring Chinese people with their numbers) - While they used Chinese laborers, this wasn't their primary activity upon arrival.
*   **D: Kondima kopesa boyangeli ya Taiwan na Mokonzi Qing** (Deciding to give governance of Taiwan to the Qing Emperor) - This happened much later, when the Qing dynasty conquered Taiwan.



"
Boyokani ya Shimonoseki esalaki nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Taiwan ekomaki Etuka nase ya bokonzi ya Qing**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Na 1895, ntango bato ya Chine na bato ya Japon babelaki na mbala ya liboso na bitumba (1894-1895), boyangeli ya Qing esalaki boyokani na Shimonoseki, bandimaki kopesa boyangeli ya Taiwan na maboko ya Japon...""  This directly translates to: ""In 1895, when China and Japan were engaged in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty lost the Treaty of Shimonoseki, and were forced to cede control of Taiwan to Japan...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Japon elongamaki na etumba ya liboso ya Sino-Japon** - While true, the treaty *resulted* from the war, it wasn't what the treaty *was*.
*   **C: Makoki ya Taiwan pona kozua lisusu bisika naye ya pembeni ya mai** - This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Kibonkozi ya Japon likolo na Taiwan** - This is a consequence of the treaty, not the treaty itself.



"
Nivo ya pH ya Chimi etalemaka lolenge nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Lolenge nini acid ezali pete to chimic** (How strong an acid a chemical is).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Babengaka yango pH ya eloko ya chimie...Balakisi nivo ya pH na motango ya baions ya hydrogène...na eloko ya chimie oyo bamekaki."" (This explains the pH of a chemical substance...pH levels indicate the concentration of hydrogen ions...in the chemical substance in question).  This directly links pH to the acidity/alkalinity of a chemical.
* **pH scale measures acidity/alkalinity:**  The passage further explains that cabbage juice changes color depending on whether something is acidic or alkaline. This is the core function of pH - to quantify how acidic or alkaline a substance is.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Baprotons boni ezali na kati ya Chimi (How many protons are in the chemical):** While pH *relates* to protons (hydrogen ions), it doesn't directly measure the total number of protons *within* the chemical's structure. It measures their concentration in solution.
* **C: Ba Hydrogenes boni ezali kati na ba ions chimique (How many hydrogens are in the chemical ions):** Similar to B, it's about hydrogen *ions*, not the total hydrogen atoms.
* **D: Baelectrons boni ezali na kati ya chimie (How many electrons are in the chemical):** Electrons are involved in the *process* of acidity (proton donation/acceptance), but pH doesn’t directly measure electron count.



"
Nini elongolamaki na kati ya baions Hydrogene?,"The correct answer is **A: BaProtons**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Baions ya hydrogène eza baprotons oyo balongola baélectrons..."" which translates to ""Hydrogen ions are protons that donate electrons...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pH:** pH is a *measure* of hydrogen ion concentration, not what they *are*.
* **C: Alkaline:** Alkaline refers to substances with a high pH, the opposite of acidic. It's a property, not the component itself.
* **D: BaElectrons:** While hydrogen ions *relate* to electrons (by donating them), the ions *themselves* are protons.



"
Maloba nini na mae malandi elimboli malamu te Lolendo ya Nkosi?,"The correct answer is **A: Bazalaka na bizaleli ndenge moko na etuluku ya bambwa.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bankosi basalaka makambo neti bambwa ya zamba, banyama ekokona na ndenge ya kokamwa na bankosi (kasi te na baniau mosusu ya minene) na bizalelei na bango..."" This directly translates to ""Bankosi do things like old dogs, they enjoy being caressed by the bankosi (but not by other large animals) and their offspring.""  This means they have a unique relationship/offspring dynamic within their group.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Botangi ya mibali na ya basi ekokani te:** The passage implies conflict *within* the group (""Mbala mingi basi bazalaka na boyokani makasi kati na bango""), not that parents and offspring can't interact.
* **C: Mibali na basi bango nyonso bayokanaka malamu:**  The passage specifically states they often have strong conflicts (""boyokani makasi"").
* **D: Bango nyonso bakoki koboma mpe bayebi kofanda na basusu:** While they live with other animals, the passage emphasizes their unique connection *within* their own bankosi family and their ability to be touched only by their own kind.



"
Na mae malandi maloba nini elimboli malamu te ezaleli ya bankosi?,"The correct answer is **B: Bizaleli na bango ekokani na ya ba mbwa ya zamba.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bankosi basalaka makambo neti bambwa ya zamba, banyama ekokona na ndenge ya kokamwa na bankosi (kasi te na baniau mosusu ya minene) na bizalelei na bango...""  This directly translates to ""Bankosi do things like tame jackals, animals can be trained in the way of the bankosi (but not other large groups) and have offspring with them...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bayebi kofanda na basusu malamu** - The passage says they *live amongst* people, not that they are *bad* people.
* **C: Bango nyonso mibali na basi bakoki koboma makasi pona koluka bilei** - The passage says they are a great help to people and their children, but doesn't specifically say they can easily help deliver babies.
* **D: Bazali na bizaleli ekokana na baniau ya minene misusu** - The passage states they *cannot* have offspring with other large groups, the opposite of this option.



"
Balapins balukamaka lokola bilei mbala ebele pona nani?,"The correct answer is **A: Baniau ya mikie** (Small creatures).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""ezali kosala niche, mosala ya ntina oyo niau nyonso aza na yango, mpe epekisaka ye na kowelana na basusu."" This translates to ""it creates a niche, a role that every creature has in it, and allows it to coexist with others.""  It then lists examples of *small* creatures like ants (bafourmis), rodents (barongeurs), insects (miselekete), and worms (bandeke).
* **The question (Q) asks:** What do pinworms look for?  Pinworms are a type of parasite, and parasites thrive in environments with many small creatures as hosts or part of the food chain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Baniau ya minene** (Large creatures) - The passage focuses on small creatures.
* **C: Baniau ya muke munene** (Large animals) - Similar to B, the passage doesn't focus on large animals.
* **D: BaMboloko** (Animals) - Too broad. While the passage discusses animals, it specifically highlights *small* animals and their ecological roles.



"
Baniau ya mike mikie mbala ebele elukaka bilei nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Barongeurs**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sekele ya kolonga na bango ezali kosala niche, mosala ya ntina oyo niau nyonso aza na yango, mpe epekisaka ye na kowelana na basusu"" - referring to the *barongeurs* (rodents) filling a niche, performing a function all organisms have, and allowing for interaction with others.  The passage highlights their significant role in the ecosystem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bampuku:** While mentioned, they are simply *examples* of animals that live in the environment, not the focus of the niche discussion.
*   **C: BaMboloko:** Same as bampuku – examples, not the core focus.
*   **D: Mbuli:**  Also an example, not the central point about ecological roles.



"
Na Mae malandi nini ezali te na bizaleli ya BaOcelot na lolenge naye yakoluka bilei?,"The correct answer is **C: Kolanda banyama oyo bazali kolanda na butu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bakoki komona malamu mpenza na molili mpo bamonaka na butu, mpe batambolaka mpe na mayele."" (They can see far in the forest to hunt in the daytime, and also hunt at night.)  This directly indicates they hunt animals in the daytime.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Kobima libanda ya esika nabango ya kobatama:** The passage mentions they leave tracks to show where they were, but doesn't say *this* is a difficulty.
    * **B: Kolanda solo ya nyama oyo bazali kolanda:** The passage mentions they hunt prey, but doesn't specifically state they follow the *scent* of the prey is a hardship.
    * **D: Balandaka kaka banyama ya mikie:** The passage clearly says they hunt a variety of animals (""bamakaku, banioka, bampuku mpe bandeke soki bakoki"").



"
Na mae malandi nini elimboli Ocelot malamu te? ,"The correct answer is **A: Bakoki koluka bilei malamu mingi na butu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bakoki komona malamu mpenza na molili mpo bamonaka na butu..."" (They can see many traces in the mud for tracking in the dark) This directly explains why ocelots have good night vision – to track prey in the dark.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Batambolaka nokinoki:** The passage mentions they climb trees, but doesn't link this to their good vision.
* **C: Makoki nabango ya koyoka solo ezali nase:** The passage says they *hunt* alone, not that their ability to hunt alone is a benefit.
* **D: Balingaka koluka banyama ya mikie:** The passage says they *eat* small animals, but this doesn’t explain *how* they are good at finding them.



"
Na mae malandi nini ekoki te kozala eloko ya makasi koleka na bizaleli ya Tigre?,"The correct answer is **B: Komata na esika**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""tigre akoki komata (kasi malamu te)"" which translates to ""a tiger can swim (but not well).""  It specifically says a tiger *cannot* swim well.  Therefore, swimming well is something a tiger can't do as a strong characteristic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Koganga:** The passage doesn't mention anything about tigers and coughing.
*   **C: Kopumbwa noki:** The passage says tigers are pushed/shoved by millions of flies, so being pushed isn't something they *can't* do.
*   **D: Kobenda:** The passage states tigers bend/flex five times, indicating it's something they *can* do.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, bokeseni ya Tigre na Nkosi ezali nini na mae malandi?","The correct answer is **A: Makoki nabango ya kobeta mai** (Their ability to jump high).

Here's why:

The text states: ""tigre akoki komata (kasi malamu te), **kobeta mai**..."" which translates to ""a tiger can jump (but not well), **jump high**...""

The question asks about the difference between a tiger and a lion (""Nkosi"" means lion). The text *directly* highlights jumping height as a characteristic of tigers. The other options are mentioned, but not presented as a defining difference.

* **B: Mongongo ya kolela nabango** (Their hunting style) - The text mentions hunting style is *not* a major difference.
* **C: Makoki nabango ya kopumbwa** (Their ability to be stunned) - This is a detail, not a core difference.
* **D: Makasi nabango pona kobenda** (Their strength to bend) -  The text says they can bend 5 times, but doesn't position this as a contrast with lions.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, Robert Hooke asalaki nini yambo ya baBiologists misusu?","The correct answer is **A: Kotala baselile yakokufa** (He discovered dead cells).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Azalaki moto ya liboso oyo amonaki baselile ya kokufa"" which translates to ""He was the first person to observe dead cells.""  Hooke observed cells in cork, which are essentially the cell walls of *dead* plant cells. This was the foundational discovery that led to the understanding of cells as the basic unit of life.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kosalela microscope ponakomona ba enama** (Using a microscope to see tissues) - While he *used* a microscope, the text focuses on *what* he saw, not the act of using the microscope itself.
* **C: Kotala biloko ya mikie mikie** (Discovering tiny things) - He discovered cells, which *are* tiny things, but this isn't specific enough. The important part is they were cells, and they were dead.
* **D: Amonaki moto ya liboso balisanga ya mukie makasi ya eloko** (He saw the first complex structures of an organism) - While cells *are* structures of organisms, the text specifically highlights his discovery of *dead* cells in cork.



"
Ebandeli ya Kombo “cell” to selile elobi nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Chambre ya mukie** (Small room).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Selile euta na liloba ya Kilatini cella oyo elimboli chambre ya moke.""  This translates to ""The word 'cell' comes from the Latin word 'cella' which means a small room.""

Robert Hooke observed what looked like small rooms (chambers) in the cork he was looking at under a microscope, and that's why he called them ""cells"".



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, banyama mingi bazali na makoki ya kosala nini?","The correct answer is **B: Kolongwa esika to kotambola** (To move around or travel).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Banyama mingi etambolaka."" (Many animals move around/travel). This is the most direct answer supported by the passage.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Kopumbwa (To breathe):** While animals breathe, the text *mentions* breathing as a characteristic of *some* animals (those with lungs), but it doesn't state it's a general ability of *all* animals described.
    * **C: Kobeta mai (To grow big):** The text doesn't mention anything about animals growing big.
    * **D: Kotimola (To eat):** The text states animals *use* their mouths (""Batimolaka mabele""), but doesn't say eating is a general capability.  It's a *function* of having a mouth, not a fundamental ability like movement.



Therefore, **B** is the best and most accurate answer based on the provided text."
"Kolanda maloba wana, banyama misusu bazangaka eloko nini?","The correct answer is **B: Makoki ya koliya lisusu biloko na kati ya libumu** (The ability to eat other things inside their bodies).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Banyama mingi etambolaka."" (Many animals digest).  It also mentions they eat things *inside* themselves (""na kati""). This strongly implies they have internal digestive systems.
* **The passage also says:** ""Banyama pamba eza na boongo (atako banyama nyonso te nde baza na yango)."" (Some animals have lungs (but not all animals have them)). This shows not all animals have the same features.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Selile:** (Environment/Habitat) While animals *live* in environments, the passage focuses on *what they do* with food, not where they live.
* **C: Boongo:** (Lungs)  The passage explicitly states not all animals have lungs.
* **D: Makoki ya koliya:** (Ability to eat) This is too general. The passage doesn't just say they *can* eat, but *how* they process food – by digesting it internally.



"
Nini esungaka banzete na tango ya Photosynthesis?,"The correct answer is **D: Moi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Banzete esalaka bilei na yango na moi na nzela ya ebongiseli babengi photosynthese.""  This translates to ""Plants produce oxygen and water through the process of photosynthesis.""  Therefore, *moi* (water) is a product of photosynthesis in plants.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Esika ya Malili (Place of Fruits):** While plants *have* fruits, the place of fruits isn't produced *by* photosynthesis.
* **B: Banyama (Animals):** Animals use oxygen produced by plants, but aren't produced *by* photosynthesis.
* **C: Bilei (Oxygen):**  While oxygen *is* produced by photosynthesis, the question asks what is *sungaka* (taken/used) by plants *in* photosynthesis, not what is produced.  The text focuses on what plants *make* during photosynthesis, not what they consume.



"
Eloko nini bato babimisaka oyo banzete ezuaka?,"The correct answer is **D: Carbone dioxide**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Banzete ezwaka dioxide ya carbone oyo bato babimisaka (elingi koloba kofula)."" This translates to ""Plants absorb carbon dioxide that people emit (meaning breathe out).""

Therefore, the thing people emit that plants absorb is carbon dioxide.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, ndakisa nini na kati ya mae malandi ekoki kopekisa evolution?","The correct answer is **B: Ndambu ya population kokende na esika ya sika** (The size of the population changes in a specific location).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a scenario of isolation and adaptation.** A small group (biloko moko ya moke) gets separated from the larger population (bato mingi ya mboka).  This isolated group then adapts to its new environment (esika ya sika).  The changing population size is a key factor that allows this differentiation to occur.
* **Speciation (kosala biloko ya sika)**, as the passage explains, is driven by differences arising within populations.  The size of the population influences how easily these differences can become established. A smaller, isolated population is more susceptible to genetic drift and faster changes due to selection pressures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lisanga ya mukie kozanga kobika na esika ya sika (The struggle of an individual to adapt to a specific location):** While individual adaptation *happens*, it's the *population's* response to the environment that drives evolution, not just a single organism's struggle.
* **C: Population komeka koyeba lolenge ya kobika na esika naye ya sika (A population begins to show a tendency to adapt to a specific location):** This is a *result* of the evolutionary process, not the driving factor.  The change in population size is what sets the stage for this tendency to emerge.
* **D: Population moko ekomi mibale (A population becomes many):** This is a consequence of speciation, not the initial cause.



Therefore, the change in population size in a specific location is the most relevant factor highlighted in the passage relating to evolution."
Na mae malandi maloba nini elimboli eteni ya speciation malamu te ? ,"The correct answer is **B: Ezali eteni ya motuya mingi na evolution** (It is a key part of evolution).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Spéciation eza mbano oyo ebimaka ntango nyonso mpe eza eteni ya ntina mingi ya évolution."" (Speciation is a process that happens constantly and is a key part of evolution).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ekomaka tango population ya sika ekoki te koyekola kofanda na esika** (It happens when a population can no longer interbreed) - While reproductive isolation *leads* to speciation, it's not the definition of speciation itself. The passage doesn't focus on this as the defining characteristic.
* **C: Ezali kolobela bosali ya bikelamu ya sika** (It is the continuation of the life of a species) - This is a consequence of speciation, but not what speciation *is*.
* **D: Bozalisi na yango ekoki kopekisama te** (Those involved cannot adapt) - Speciation is actually *about* adaptation and divergence, not a lack of it.



"
Eteni nini ya system ya circulation oyo ememaka makila na motema?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba arteres**.

Here's why:

* **P** states that blood *enters* the heart through veins and *leaves* the heart through arteries. The question asks what carries blood *away* from the heart (where it's being pumped *to*).
* **Arteries** are the blood vessels that carry blood *away* from the heart.
* **Capillaires** are tiny blood vessels where exchange of nutrients and waste happens, they don't directly take blood *from* the heart.
* **Enama** simply means blood.
* **Misisa** means muscles.

Therefore, the answer is **Ba arteres** (arteries).



"
Batiyo nini ezalaka ya mukie makasi na system ya circulation?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba Capillaires**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** explicitly states: ""Batiyo ya mike babengaka yango ba capillaires.""  This translates to ""The smallest vessels are called capillaries.""
* The passage describes capillaries as the smallest blood vessels in the circulatory system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ba arteres (Arteries):** The passage states arteries *carry* blood *to* the heart, but doesn't say they are the smallest.
* **C: Misisa (Muscles):** Muscles are part of the body, but not the circulatory system's vessels.
* **D: Ba Enama (Blood):** Blood flows *through* the vessels, but isn't the vessel itself.



"
Makoki ya nyama ya mukie emataka na lolenge nini pona kokanga mapapu naye kozongisa sima?,"The correct answer is **A: Kozua bilei ebele** (Attracting prey easily).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Makoki na bango ya kopumbwa esalisaka bango na kokima banguna na pete nyonso mpe na kozwa bilei na balongani babongi."" (Their ability to fly allows them to hunt easily and attract prey from far away).  This directly links the ability to fly to easily attracting prey.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bisika ya kobatama** (The ability to be scared) - The passage mentions fear as a reason *others* might avoid them, not as a hunting tactic.
* **C: Kozua balingami** (Attracting companions) - The passage focuses on attracting *prey*, not companions.
* **D: Vitesi ya kobunda** (Speed of movement) - While flight provides speed, the passage specifically highlights the ease of *attracting* prey.



"
Na mae matali makoki ya banyama ya mikie kopunmbwa nini epatami te na mae malandi oyo ekoki kozala affecter na makoki ya nyama ya mukie kopunbwa?,"The correct answer is **B: Molai ya bomoi (Life cycle)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on how metamorphosis (transformation) is crucial for insect survival.** It states insects with incomplete metamorphosis can become prey easily, while those with complete metamorphosis (like dragons and mayflies – representing more complex transformations) are better protected.  This directly relates to their *life cycle* and how it affects their ability to survive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kobotama (To hunt):** While insects are hunted, the passage isn't *about* hunting, but about how insects *avoid* being hunted through metamorphosis.
* **C: Kokutanisa bilei (To find food):**  Finding food is important for insects, but the passage's central theme is protection through development, not food acquisition.
* **D: Kosala musala malamu (To build a good home):**  Building homes is a part of insect life, but not the main topic discussed.



Therefore, **Molai ya bomoi (Life cycle)** best encapsulates the key concept presented in the passage."
Ezaleli nini na mae malandi oyo elandanaka te na BaDinosore?,"The correct answer is **B: Masala**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bato ebele bamonaka bango te neti badinosaure po baza na **masala** mpe bapumbwaka."" (People didn't recognize them as dinosaurs because they were looking for **trouble/problems** and were confused). 

The text directly links the people's inability to recognize the creatures as dinosaurs to their search for trouble/problems. The other options are things the creatures *did* (walk, climb, roar) but aren't the reason people misidentified them.



"
Na mae malandi ezaleli nini oyo ekokani te kati ya bandeke na baDinosore?,"The correct answer is **C: Makoki ya kopumbwa** (The ability to be fooled).

Here's why:

The passage states the people don't recognize the creatures *as* dinosaurs, and are instead ""fooled"" into thinking they are something else (like ancestors).  The other options are things the creatures *do* – they have claws and feet, move like a T-Rex, etc.  The key difference is the people's *misunderstanding*, their ability to be deceived.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kobwaka maki:** (Having claws) - The passage mentions claws, but it's a characteristic *of* the creatures, not what separates them from being recognized as dinosaurs.
* **B: Kosalela makolo mibale ya sima pona kotambola:** (Using many legs to walk) - This describes *how* they move, not *why* they aren't identified as dinosaurs.
* **D: Makolo na manzaka:** (Feet with paws) - Again, a physical characteristic, not the defining difference in perception.



"
"Kolanada maloba wana, eteni nini ya nzete ya Cycas oyo Triceratops akoki koliya?","The correct answer is **A: Matiti neti mitole**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Triceratops aliaki ba cycas, oyo eza lolenge ya nzete moko oyo ezalaki mingi na Crétacé. Banzete oyo eza neti banzete ya mbila ya mike oyo eza na matiti neti mitole."" This translates to: ""Triceratops ate cycads, which is a type of plant that was common in the Cretaceous. Those plants are small, seed-bearing plants with cones.""

Therefore, the cycads Triceratops ate had **cones (matiti neti mitole)**.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana,Triceratops akoki koliya nini na mae malandi? ","The correct answer is **B: Nzete ya mitape makasi** (Cycads).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Triceratops aliaki ba cycas, oyo eza lolenge ya nzete moko oyo ezalaki mingi na Crétacé."" This translates to ""Triceratops ate cycads, which is a type of plant that was abundant in the Cretaceous period.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pareseau** - This word doesn't appear in the text and isn't related to Triceratops' diet.
*   **C: Tiaku** - The text mentions tiaku (chickens) as modern animals that can eat tough plants, but *Triceratops* ate cycads, not tiaku.
*   **D: Nzete ya bambuma ya ngenge** - While the text mentions that some modern animals can eat tough plants, it specifically states *Triceratops* preferred cycads.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na ba Sports elandi sport nini ekoki kozala ya koyebana makasi na biteni ya nordi ya Mboka Itali?","The correct answer is **C: Snowboarding**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Masano bato balingaka mingi eza ndembo, [...] bato ya Italie basanganaka na masano ya mikili mingi mpe ya Olympique."" (Many sports that people like are football, [...] Italians participate in many winter and Olympic sports.)
* **""Masano ya mikili""** translates to ""winter sports.""
* **Biteni ya nordi** (Nordic countries) are known for winter sports like skiing and snowboarding.
* While the passage mentions other sports, it *specifically* links Italians to winter and Olympic sports.  Snowboarding is a prominent winter sport.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndembo (Football):** While hugely popular, football isn't specifically tied to the Nordic region.
* **B: Voleybal (Volleyball):**  Not a typical Nordic/winter sport.
* **D: Course ya Moto F1 (Formula 1 Racing):**  A summer motorsport, not associated with the Nordic region or winter.



"
"Kolanda bansango epesami na maloba wana, Sport nini na mae malandi elongaki World Championship pona Mboka Itali","The correct answer is **A: Ndembo** (Football/Soccer).

The text explicitly states: ""Ekipe ya ndembo ya Italie...elongaki coupe du monde ya FIFA na 2006."" (The Italian football team...won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.) This directly links football to winning a World Cup for Italy.

The other options are mentioned as popular sports in Italy, but not as World Championship winners specifically mentioned in the text."
Biteni misusu ya Luxembourg ekomaki Belgique sima ya likambo nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Botomboki ya Belgique**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Biteni ya Belgique ya lelo ezalaki naino na Luxembourg na kala kasi ekoma ya Belgique nsima ya botomboki ya Belgique ya mibu 1830.""  This directly translates to: ""The current territories of Belgium were also in Luxembourg in the past, becoming part of Belgium after the Belgian revolution of the 1830s.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Etumba ya Mokili ya I (World War I):** The text mentions Germany's influence later, but not specifically related to WWI when discussing the initial territorial changes.
*   **C: Etumba ya Mokili ya II (World War II):** Same as above - Germany's influence is mentioned, but not as the cause of Luxembourg becoming part of Belgium.
*   **D: Ebandeli ya Union Europeene (Beginning of the European Union):** The text states Luxembourg *joined* the European Union in 1957, not that it became part of Belgium because of it.



"
Na mae malandi nini epekisaki Luxembourg kozala na katikati?,"The correct answer is **B: Kokota Boyokani Union Europeene** (Joining the European Union).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Na 1957, Luxembourg ekomaki na kati ya mikili oyo esalaki lisanga oyo eyebana lelo na nkombo ya Union européenne."" (In 1957, Luxembourg joined the founding treaties that form today's European Union.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Alemagne kokota na makasi** (Germany tried to control it) - While the passage mentions Germany's influence, it doesn't say this is *why* Luxembourg is significant today.
* **C: Botomboki ya Belgique** (Belgian Revolution) - The Belgian Revolution is part of Luxembourg's *history*, but not its current position.
* **D: Kozala Mboka ya komitalela yango moko** (Being a small country) - Being small doesn't explain its importance or central role.



"
Kilometre carrer boni ya mboka Turquie ezali na Erope?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The text states: ""23 764 kilomètres carrés (9174 miles carrés) na Eropa"" which translates to ""23,764 square kilometers (9174 miles squares) in Europe.""



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, kimolai ya Turquie ezali boni?","The correct answer is **A: 1600**.

The text states: ""Teritware ya Turquie eza molai bakilometele koleka 1 600 (1 000 mi) pe 800 km (500 mi) na monene, ezalaka lokola rectangle."" This translates to ""The territory of Turkey is approximately 1,600 kilometers (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, like a rectangle.""  The question asks for the *length* of Turkey, which is stated as 1600 kilometers.



"
Lokota ya Latin esalemaka pona nini na Engumba Vatican?,"The correct answer is **A: Makambo ya Nzambe** (Things of God/Religious Matters).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...basalelaka Latin mbala mingi na **makambo ya Nzambe**."" (they often use Latin in **religious matters**).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kosolola mikolo nyonso** (To celebrate all times/occasions) - While Latin *is* used during ceremonies, the text doesn't say it's for *all* occasions.
* **C: Mibeko** (Customs) -  Latin usage isn't primarily about customs, but about religious practice.
* **D: Kosolola ya bato oyo basalaka misala ya leta** (Celebration of those who practice the state) -  This is inaccurate; it's about religious practice, not state practice.



"
"Na Engumba Vatican, lokota ya Itali esalemaka te pona ntina nini?","The correct answer is **B: Kosolola ya bato oyo basalaka misala ya leta**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Engumba ya Vatican esalelaka lokota ya Italie na **mibeko na yango mpe mpona kosolola**."" This translates to ""The Vatican City uses Italian law for its customs and **to govern those who perform state duties**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mibeko (Customs)** - While Italian law applies to customs, the passage specifies it *also* applies to governance.
*   **C: Makambo ya Nzambe (Religious Matters)** - The passage states people in Vatican City frequently use Latin for religious matters, but doesn't say Italian law governs them.
*   **D: Kosolola mikolo nyonso (Governing all things)** - The passage is specific - it governs those performing *state duties*.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, kouta na bosangisi ya mingongo na ba ordinatere ya mindondomindondo nini ekoki kozua litomba?","The correct answer is **A: Miziki**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Mbala mingi basalaka enregistrement ya miziki na nzela ya ba ordinatere ya mindondomindondo mpona kobongisa mpe kosangisa mingongo."" This translates to: ""Often they record music using portable computers to improve and share songs.""  The question asks what the passage links to sharing songs (mingongo) with portable computers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ba nimation (Animations):** The passage doesn't mention animations.
* **C: Bafoto (Photos):** While photos *are* mentioned, the context of sharing songs isn't related to photos.
* **D: Kotonga bandako (Talking/Communication):** The passage focuses on *music* sharing, not general communication.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, ebeleya bandako ya esika nini emonanaki kozala na ba toilete ya mindele?","The correct answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that both Harappa and **Mohenjo-daro** had sophisticated systems for collecting wastewater and drainage, comparable to toilets. The other options are mentioned as having similar systems, but Mohenjo-daro is directly linked to having these facilities.



"
Na Bisika elandi esika nini bipai ya malamu ya kobwaka mai ya mbindo emonanaki?,"The correct answer is **B: Santorini**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bitika ya bibongiseli ya kobwaka mai ya mabe oyo bamonaki na bandako ya bingumba ya Minoan na Crete mpe ya **Santorin** na Grèce.""  This directly translates to ""Evidence of sophisticated wastewater drainage systems were found in the ruins of the Minoan city of Crete and **Santorini** in Greece.""

While the passage mentions Harappa, Egypt, and China also had drainage systems, it *specifically* highlights Santorini as a place where evidence of *sophisticated* wastewater drainage was found, mirroring the systems in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro.



"
Na mae malandi nini esalaka patineur kobaluka?,"The correct answer is **B: Basonge mibale na Razwar ya patineur**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Basonge nyonso mibale esalisaka na kozwa glace malamu, ata soki etengami. Po se ya razware ezalaka ya kobaluka mwa moke, razware ebalukaka na ngambu moko to mosusu, nsonge na yango etutanaka na glace, ebalukaka mpe. Oyo nde esalisaka patineur na kobaluka.""  This translates to: ""All the forces on the skater cause them to slide on the good ice, even if they resist. If the force is to fall to one side or the other, depending on how it interacts with the ice, it also falls. This is what causes the skater to fall.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Suka ya Songe ya Razwar ya patineur** (The reason for the force of the skater) - While related, the passage focuses on *what* causes the fall, not the reason *why* the force exists.
*   **C: Mayele mpe boyebi nyonso ya patineur** (The body and all the skater's abilities) - The passage doesn't mention the skater's physical attributes or skills.
*   **D: Glace ya malamu** (Good ice) - Good ice allows for skating, but it's the *forces* acting *on* the skater *because* of the ice that cause the fall.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi elimboli malamu libulu na kati ya razwar ya patin ya mikolo oyo?","The correct answer is **A: Basonge mibale**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Lolemo likolo ya patin ya glace ya mikolo na biso yo **eza na basonge mibale na libulu na kati na yango.**"" (Our hockey skate's flaw is that it has many bumps inside).  The passage then explains how these bumps cause the skater to fall.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Esika ya kobaluka (Place to fall):** While the passage *describes* falling, it doesn't identify a *place* where falls happen. It explains *why* they happen.
* **C: Esika ya kokutana (Place to meet):** This is not mentioned in the passage at all.
* **D: Kotengama (Where it breaks):**  The passage discusses bumps, not breaking.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, eteni nini esalaka ete Ba Atomes elongola nguya ya koleka ebele na mwinda?","The correct answer is **B: kolendisa mpona kobimisa baphotons** (using light to measure photons).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that scientists use a method called ""kolendisa mpona kobimisa kongenga"" (using light to measure energy) which involves shining light (photons) onto atoms. This process allows them to measure the energy of the photons and, consequently, understand the structure of the atom.  The whole process described is *how* atoms are studied and ""elongola nguya ya koleka ebele na mwinda"" (understood from within).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Radiation:** While radiation is involved (photons *are* a form of radiation), it's the *method* of using light/photons that's key to understanding the atom, not just radiation itself.
* **C: Baphotons:** Photons are tools *used* to study atoms, not the reason why atoms can be understood.
* **D: kolendisa mpona kobimisa radiation:** The passage specifically mentions using light to measure *photons*, not just radiation in general.



"
Nini etindaka atome kobimisa photon?,"The correct answer is **B: Kolendisa oyo etindamaka na mwinda ya makasi** (The process that happens at high speed).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bato ya siansi babengaka metode wana """"kolendisa mpona kobimisa kongenga"""" po bapesaki atome moto na nzela ya pole makasi, esalaka ete ebimisisa pole ya photon...""  This directly translates to ""Scientists call this method 'using speed to measure energy' because they send atoms quickly in a high-speed way, causing it to emit a photon's energy...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kobima nguya ya koleka** (Emitting energy of a particle) - While true that *something* is emitted, the passage focuses on the *how* - the speed.
* **C: Nguya oyo ezali stable te** (Unstable energy) -  The passage doesn't discuss stability.
* **D: Ezaleli pona kobundisa Kongenga** (It exists to bundle energy) - The passage doesn't state a purpose of bundling energy.



Therefore, the passage explicitly links the emission of a photon to a process involving high speed (""pole makasi"")."
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini ekoki kopekisa ampule kosala?","The correct answer is **C: Nsinga ya kati ya Ampule kozika** (The filament inside the bulb is broken).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the problem is with ampoules (light bulbs) that *don't* work and have been used before. It also mentions needing to replace the bulb. This points to a physical failure *within* the bulb itself – specifically, the filament breaking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Biloko ya mwinda kobomana malamu te** (The switch doesn't turn on the light) - The text mentions checking the switch/cable, but that's *before* considering the bulb itself is faulty.
* **B: Kotiya eteni ya libende ya ampule na soket malamu te** (The base of the bulb isn't properly screwed into the socket) - The text mentions making sure it's screwed in correctly *alongside* replacing the bulb. It's not the primary reason a used bulb stops working.
* **D: Kotambola ya courant na kati ya soket kozala malembe** (The flow of electricity in the socket is good) - The text warns about the danger of electricity *if* the bulb is faulty, implying the socket itself is likely working.



"
Na mae malandi nini ekoki kozala likama makasi?,"The correct answer is **A: Nsinga**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""sukasuka nsinga ya ampule ezikaki mpe ampule ezalaki kosala lisusu te"" (a broken bulb and bulbs that no longer work). It then goes on to explain the dangers of changing a bulb, implying the *bulb itself* is the source of the problem and requires replacement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Esika ya kopelisa mwinda (The place to plug in the switch):**  The passage mentions switches and cables, but doesn't say the *socket* is the problem.
* **C: Eteni yase ya Ampule (The base of the bulb):** While important for the change, the base isn’t inherently dangerous. It’s the broken/non-working bulb that is.
* **D: Nsinga ya munene to cable (A large bulb or cable):**  The passage focuses on broken bulbs, not the size of the bulb or the cable.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini esalemaka tango neutron ekabwani?","Correct answer: **B: Nguya ebimaka**

Here's why:

The passage explains that a fission bomb works by splitting an atom's nucleus (with protons and neutrons) which releases a large amount of energy.  The ""moké neti kobaluka likalo ya moke na ngomba ya moke"" (a chain reaction) happens because this released energy (nguya) causes further splitting of other atoms. Therefore, when a neutron initiates the process, **energy is released** (nguya ebimaka).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baprotons ezuamaka** – While protons are *part* of the nucleus, the main result of the split isn't protons flying out; it's the release of energy.
*   **C: BaAtomes ekomaka bisika nyonso** – Atoms become unstable, but the initial event is the *splitting* and energy release, not general instability.
*   **D: Baneutrons ebungaka** – Neutrons are *used* to initiate the split, not released *by* the initial split (though more neutrons are released as part of the chain reaction, it's not the *immediate* result of the first neutron impact).



"
Na mae malandi nini elimboli malamu kobenga moto na mosika kozonga nase?,"The correct answer is **B: Ba Satellites**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Soki ozobenga moto moko oyo aza na bankoto ya bakilometele, ozosalela **satelite**."" (If you want to find someone who is far away, you use a **satellite**.)  This directly links satellites to locating people over long distances.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Telescopes:** Telescopes are used for observing distant *objects* in space, not locating people on Earth.
*   **C: Minda:**  ""Minda"" translates to ""fields"" and has no relevance to locating people.
*   **D: Ba Rockets:** Rockets *launch* satellites and telescopes, but aren't used for the actual locating.



"
Na biloko oyo elandi nini baselalaka pona kotinda telescope na mapata?,"The correct answer is **B: Ba Rockets**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Batindaki satelite na likolo na nzela ya rocket."" (They launch satellites into space using rockets.)  It also mentions the need for a large rocket to carry telescopes into space.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Minda ya mpole** (Soft ground) - The text doesn't mention anything about the ground being soft.
*   **C: Atmosphere ya mabele** (Earth's atmosphere) - While the atmosphere *is* a challenge (telescopes need to get *above* it for clear viewing), it's not what they *use* to launch things.
*   **D: Satelite ya koleka 100 kilometeres** (Satellite 100 kilometers away) -  Satellites are what are *launched*, not what is used for launching.



"
Nini esengeli koyebana na makambo oyo esalemaka mbala na mbala pona koyeba lolenge tango ezali kokende?,"The correct answer is **B: Repetition**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Okoki kotia yo moko bilembo na ndenge ntango ezoleka na kotanga ba repetition ya likambo moko oyo ezongaka. Likambo ezongaka eza likambo oyo esalemaka mbala na mbala.""  This translates to: ""You can recognize a pattern in how time passes and the repetition of an event that recurs. A recurring event is an event that happens repeatedly.""

The passage directly links understanding how time *feels* (its passage) to recognizing *repetitions* of events.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bowumeli (Memory):** While memory is related to time and past events, the passage focuses on the *pattern* of events, not just remembering them.
* **C: Effet (Effect):**  Effect refers to a result, and while events have effects, the passage is about recognizing the *recurrence* of the events themselves.
* **D: Mokakatano (Connection):**  Connection is too broad. The passage is specifically about a cyclical pattern, not just any connection between events.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, eteni nini ya likambo esalemaka pona kokokisa tango?","The correct answer is **B: Repetition**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Okoki kotia yo moko bilembo na ndenge ntango ezoleka na kotanga ba repetition ya likambo moko oyo ezongaka. Likambo ezongaka eza likambo oyo esalemaka mbala na mbala.""

This translates to: ""You can find a mark in how time passes and creates repetitions of an event that returns. A returning event is an event that happens repeatedly.""

The passage directly links the concept of time's passage to the *repetition* of events.  The other options are related but aren't the direct answer to how time is marked/measured in the context of the text:

*   **Kimolai (Time):** While the topic, it's not *what* marks time.
*   **Experience:** Experiences contribute to our perception of time, but aren't the fundamental marker described.
*   **Effet (Effect):**  Effects are *results* of events, not the events themselves which mark time.

"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini ekokani na lolenge ya mokitani ya kiti ya kibokonzi","The correct answer is **D: Kokende na Universite liboso ya kokende na mosala ya kisoda** (Attending University first before working in a soda factory).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** Charles went to university *before* working at the soda factory. He studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, and *then* worked at the soda factory.  The passage highlights this as a common path for those with a good education from the British civil service.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kozua diplome ya Universite na 2.2** (Getting a 2:2 University degree) - While true, the passage focuses on the *order* of events, not just the degree itself.
* **B: Koboya kokende na Universite pona kokende na Musala ya soda** (Leaving University to work in a soda factory) - The passage doesn’t say he *left* university to work there; he finished his studies and *then* worked there.
* **C: Kotanga Makambo ya kala** (Studying Archaeology) - Again, this is true, but doesn't represent the main point the passage is making about his career path.



"
"Kolanda bansango epesami na maloba wana, Charles azalaki moto ya yambo kosala nini?","The correct answer is **A: Kokende mosala ya kisoda liboso ya kosilisa kelasi** (He first worked as a soda boy to pay for school).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Mbala mingi, mokitani na kiti ya bokonzi ekendaka mbala moko na soda nsima ya kosilisa kelasi."" This translates to ""Often, a student would work part-time as a soda boy to pay for school.""  It then connects this to Charles's story.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kotanga Archeolohgie:** While Charles *studied* archeology, it wasn't his first job.
* **C: Kozua Diplome:** He *received* a diploma, but that wasn't his initial activity.
* **D: Akotaki na Universite ya Trinity College:** He *attended* Trinity College, but again, that came after his initial job.



"
Masuwa Trygvasson fleet ezalaki ya mboka nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Norvege**.

The text explicitly states: ""Mokumbi ya masuwa wana eza Olaf Trygvasson, moto moko ya Norvége..."" which translates to ""The commander of that fleet was Olaf Trygvasson, a man of Norway..."" 

Therefore, the fleet belonged to Norway."
Na ngonga nini ya istware Alemagne ekabolaki makasi bizaleli na mboka estoni ?,"The passage states: ""Pene ya ekeke ya 15, nordi ya Estonie ezalaki mpenza kolanda bizaleli ya bato ya Allemagne."" This translates to: ""In the 15th century, Northern Estonia was conquered by the Germans.""

While the passage doesn't give a precise number of years of German rule, it establishes that the conquest began in the 15th century.  We need to infer which option best reflects this initial conquest.  Since the options are centuries, we look for the one closest to the 15th century.

The correct answer is **B: Bambula 400 eleki** (400 years).  While not exact, a 400-year period of influence and control is a reasonable length associated with such a conquest and is the most logical choice among the given options. The passage doesn't detail the *end* of German influence, only the *beginning* in the 15th century.



"
Lokota ya Estoni ezuaki bizaleli kouta wapi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ba Alphabets ya ba Alemands** (German Alphabets).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Eutaki na alfabe ya Allemagne pe elembo moko """"Õ/õ"""" ebakisamaki."" (It took the German alphabet and adopted one letter """"Õ/õ""""). This directly indicates the Estonian language's development stemmed from the German alphabet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Elembo Õ/õ** (The letter Õ/õ) - While important, it's *part* of the alphabet, not the source of the language's origin.
*   **C: Ba sango ya Alemagne** (German languages) - Too broad. It's specifically the *alphabet* that influenced Estonian.
*   **D: Nzambe** (God) - The passage mentions belief systems, but not as the origin of the language.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, talo ya bato oyo basololaka lokota ya Hindu ekeseni pona nini?","The correct answer is **C: Soki bato oyo bakoki koyoka lokota yango bazali kotangema** (If those who can speak the language are increasing).

Here's why:

The passage states the number of Hindi speakers is estimated between 340-800 million, and that Hindi and Urdu are very similar.  It also says that daily, speakers of all languages can communicate easily. This implies the *reason* for the large number of speakers is that people are *able to* and *do* speak it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Soki minoko misusu oyo elandani na Hindu ezali kotangema** (If other religions associated with Hinduism are increasing) - The passage doesn't mention religion as a factor.
* **B: Soki bato ya kosolola Urdu bazali kotangema** (If those who speak Urdu are increasing) - While Urdu is related, the passage focuses on Hindi.  The increase in Urdu speakers doesn't directly explain the Hindi speaker numbers.
* **D: Soki bato yakotanga munoko lokota bazali kotangema** (If people are learning the language are increasing) - While learning a language contributes to the number of speakers, the passage doesn't *focus* on the act of learning, but rather the *existing* number of speakers.



"
Na mae malandi maloba nini ezali yasolo pona lokota ya Hindu na Urdu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ekokani na ekomeli mpe elobeli**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hindi na Urdu eza na ndenge moko ndimbola kasi makomi ekeseni; na masolo ya mokolo na mokolo, balobi ya lokota nyonso mibale bakoki kosolola malamu."" This translates to: ""Hindi and Urdu are essentially the same language, but regions differ; in daily life, speakers of all levels can understand each other.""  This clearly indicates a relationship of **mutual intelligibility and similarity**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bato oyo basololaka lokota yango bayokanaka te** (People who speak that language do not agree) - The passage implies understanding, not disagreement.
* **B: Ekeseni na lolenge ya kokoma** (It exists in a state of coming) - This doesn't relate to the relationship *between* Hindi and Urdu.
* **D: Ekeseni na elobeli** (It exists in speech) - This is a general statement and doesn't define the connection between the languages.



"
Na mae malandi pona Alphabet Hangeul nini oyo ezali solo te?,"The correct answer is **B: Kombo ya solo ya alphabet ezalaki Hunan Jeongeum**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Na ebandeli apesaki yango nkombo alfabe ya Hangeul Hunmin Jeongeum, oyo elimboli """"makelele ya malamu mpona koteya bato"""".""  This directly translates to ""Initially he named the Hangeul alphabet Hunmin Jeongeum, which means 'The Proper Sounds for the Instruction of the People'.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ebandaki na ebandeli ya kibokonzi ya mokonzi Sejong:** While true, this doesn't specify the *name* of the alphabet initially.
* **C: Esalemaki na Mokonzi ya minei ya Joseon Dynasty:**  This is a fact *about* Hangeul, not its original name.
* **D: Esalemaki pona litomba moko:** The passage doesn't state it was initially created for a specific purpose beyond instruction.



"
Alphabet Hunan Jeongeum ebongwanaki kokoma nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Sejong**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...na ebandeli apesaki yango nkombo alfabe ya Hangeul Hunmin Jeongeum, oyo elimboli """"makelele ya malamu mpona koteya bato"""". Basalaki alfabe na 1444 na nse ya boyangeli ya mokonzi Sejong..."" 

This translates to: ""...initially he named the Hangeul alphabet Hunmin Jeongeum, which means """"The Proper Sounds for the Instruction of the People"""". They created the alphabet in 1444 under the leadership of King Sejong...""

Therefore, Hunmin Jeongeum was created by **Sejong**.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, Mokota nini ezuaki bizaleli ya Sanskrit?","The correct answer is **D: Makota ya Inde** (Languages of India).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...Sanskrit eza ndenge moko na lokota ya Latin oyo balobaka na Eropa...yango nde esalisaka mpona kosala balokota mingi ya Inde ya lelo...""  This translates to ""...Sanskrit is like the Latin language spoken in Europe...it therefore contributed to the development of many languages of modern India...""

Therefore, Sanskrit is a foundational language for many current languages *of India*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lokota ya Latin** (Latin language): While the passage *compares* Sanskrit to Latin, it doesn't say Latin is a result of Sanskrit.
*   **B: Balokota ya Union Europeene** (Languages of the European Union): The passage focuses on India, not the EU.
*   **C: Mako yakala** (Ancient times): While Sanskrit *is* ancient, this isn't what the passage says it *produced*. It produced modern languages.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, bosaleli ya Sanskrit ekitaki pona nini?","The correct answer is **B: Migration ya Aryan**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Moko na yango elobelaka moto moko ya Aryan oyo alongwaki na weste mpe akendaki na Inde, mpe amemaki lokota na bango elongo na bango.""  This translates to: ""One of them speaks of an Aryan person who migrated west and went to India, and brought their language with them.""  

The passage directly links the spread of Sanskrit to the migration of the Aryan people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Makasi mingi (Many religions)** - While Sanskrit is used in religious texts (like the Upanishads mentioned), the passage doesn't state that religion *caused* the origin/spread of Sanskrit.
* **C: Lokota ya Latin (Latin language)** - The passage *compares* Sanskrit to Latin, noting similarities, but doesn't say Latin caused Sanskrit's development.
* **D: Lolenge makambo etandami likolo (The development of world things)** - This is too broad and isn't specifically addressed in the passage.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, liloba nini ezali ya solo pona Gravite ya Io?","The correct answer is **C: Gravite ya io ezali ebele, ntina na yango okozala na kilo ebele.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** A person weighing 200 pounds (90kg) on Earth would weigh around 36 pounds (16kg) on Io. This clearly indicates that Io's gravity is *weaker* than Earth's gravity, resulting in a *lower* weight.
* **Option C** directly reflects this: ""Gravite ya io ezali ebele, ntina na yango okozala na kilo ebele"" translates to ""Io's gravity is weak, which is why you would weigh less.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** ""Gravite yam abele ekokoma mukia pona yo koleka gravite ya Io"" - Earth's gravity is stronger *than* Io's gravity (which is true, but doesn't answer the question of what Io's gravity *is*).
* **B:** ""Gravite ya io ezali ebele, ntina na yango okozala na kilo mukie"" - This says Io's gravity is weak, but then says you'd weigh *more* (mukie), which contradicts the passage.
* **D:** ""Gravite ya mabele ezali ebele pona yo koleka gravite ya Io"" -  This says Earth's gravity is weaker than Io's, which is false.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, kati ya mae malandi nini elimboli malamu eteni ya libanda ya sanza?","The correct answer is **B: Croute ezali monene mingi na bangomba ya mikie**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Eza moke mingi na nse ya maria mpe mwa monene na bangomba ya mike."" (It is very abundant in the depths of maria and large on the micro-mountains.) This directly supports the idea that the crust (croute) is large on micro-mountains (bangomba ya mike).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eteni ya pene mingi ezali na croute ya muke monene:** The passage doesn't focus on the *depth* of the crust, but rather its presence *on* micro-mountains.
* **C: Bamaria ekoki kozala mikie na mopanzi ya mosika:** The passage says maria can be large on both sides, not specifically the east.
* **D: Bamaria ekoki kozala mukie na bangomba ya mikie:** The passage doesn't relate the size of maria to micro-mountains.  It relates the *crust* to micro-mountains.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, esika nini croute ya sanza ezali makasi koleka?","The correct answer is **A: Na mopanzi ya pene**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mabele ya makasi eza monene pene ya 70 km mopanzi ya pene mpe 100 km na mopanzi ya mosika."" This translates to ""The large areas are 70 km in the east and 100 km in the west.""  Therefore, the crust of the sanza is largest in the east.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Esika maria ezali ebele** - The text mentions maria (marshes) but doesn't say the crust is largest *where* the marshes are.
* **C: Na bangomba ya mikie nase ya maria** - The text states it's found *with* marshes and small hills, but doesn't say it's *largest* there.
* **D: Nase ya maria** -  Similar to C, it's *associated* with marshes, not necessarily largest within them.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini endimami na bato?","The correct answer is **A: Bato basili kosala mobenmbo na minzoto misusu** (People are able to travel to other planets).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P)** directly states: ""bato bakoki kosala mobembo na monzoto mosusu pe komona mikili mosusu"" - which translates to ""people can travel to other planets and see other life"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bato bazali na makoki te ya kokende komona mikili misusu** (People are not able to see other life) - This is the *opposite* of what the passage says.
* **C: Bomoi ezali na ba planetes misusu** (Life exists on other planets) - While hinted at (""komona mikili mosusu""), the passage focuses on *people traveling* to see it, not just its existence.
* **D: Katikati ya minzoto distance ezali nase ya ba kilometer trillion** (The distance between planets is in the trillions of kilometers) - This is a detail *about* the distances, but not the main idea of what people are *doing*.



"
Nini ekomaka mukie mukie tango ozali kokende mosika na kati ya moi?,"The correct answer is **B: Moto**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""Moi mobimba esalema na mipepe, **moto**, pe plazma."" (The core is composed of dust, **fire**, and plasma.)  It then goes on to say that fire is very common when you get closer to the center of the core.

Therefore, the answer to the question ""Nini ekomaka mukie mukie tango ozali kokende mosika na kati ya moi?"" (What is found everywhere when you go closer to the center of the core?) is **moto** (fire).



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, eteni nini ya moi emonanaka kouta na mabele?","The correct answer is **C: Photosphere**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Eteni ya libanda oyo tomonaka ntango totalaka moi babengaka yango potosphere, oyo elimboli """"boule ya pole"""".""  This translates to ""...The layer that is seen when the star shines is called the photosphere, also known as the 'pole ball'.""

The passage directly identifies the photosphere as the visible outer layer of the star (moi).  The question asks what layer is seen from the outside, making photosphere the correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Croute (Crust)** - The passage doesn't mention a crust.
*   **B: Plazma (Plasma)** - While the passage mentions plasma *within* the star, it's not the layer you see from the outside.
*   **D: Eteni ya kati (Core)** - The core is the innermost part of the star, not the visible outer layer.



"
Kati botali mae malandi fase nini esungaki kokokisa theory ya Copernicus?,"The correct answer is **A: Bafase ya Venus**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Galileo Galilei observed Venus had phases (like the moon), *not just* a full circle like the sun would appear. This was crucial because it showed Venus orbits the sun, not the Earth. If Venus orbited Earth, we would only ever see its fully lit side.
* **Copernicus's theory:**  Copernicus proposed that planets orbit the Sun. Venus having phases directly supports this heliocentric model.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Koleka ya Venus:** While the observation of Venus is important, it's *the phases* specifically that matter.
* **C: Kokokana ya Moi na Venus:** The passage focuses on how the phases disprove an Earth-centered view, not just the relationship between Earth and Venus.
* **D: Kokokana ya Moi na Sanza:** The passage contrasts Venus's phases with how the Sun appears (always fully lit), which isn't about a relationship with Mars (Sanza).



"
Na mae malandi nini etalemaki na Galileo Galilei na mbula 1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Bafase ya Venus**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""moto ya astronomie ya Italie Galileo Galilei asalelaki telescope mpona komona ete Venus eza na bafase, neti kaka sanza."" (Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe that Venus has phases, not just light like the sun.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mopanzi moko ya Sanza oyo etali Moi** - While the text mentions a single spot on the Sun, it wasn't Galileo's main discovery.
*   **C: Mokili kobalukabaluka pembeni ya Moi** - The text doesn't mention any movement of a star next to the sun.
*   **D: Koleka ya Venus** -  The text discusses the *phases* of Venus, not just its brightness.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, Ebale ya Aazon etokaka mai kouta wapi?","The correct answer is **A: Ba ebale ya mikie**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ezwaka mai longwa na bankoto ya bibale ya mike."" This translates to ""It drains a large amount of water from the banks of small rivers.""  Therefore, the Amazon River gets its water from **small rivers** (ba ebale ya mikie).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ebale ya molai koleka** - While the text mentions the Amazon is a large river, it doesn't say it *gets* its water from other large rivers.
*   **C: Ocean** - The Amazon flows *into* the ocean, it doesn't get water *from* it.
*   **D: Ebale ya mibale na kimolai** - This is a bit vague and doesn't directly reflect the information in the text.



"
Lokumu nini oyo elobami kozala ya Ebale Amazon?,"The correct answer is **B: Ezali Ebale ya munene koleka** (It is a very large river).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ebale Amazon eza ebale ya mibale eleki molai mpe ebale eleki monene na Mabele."" (The Amazon River is a river of waters, very long and very large in the world.)  It emphasizes both its length *and* its size.
* **Option A** focuses only on length.
* **Option C** focuses only on length.
* **Option D** introduces ""mpanzi"" (twists/turns) which isn't a key characteristic highlighted in the passage.

Therefore, option B best summarizes the description of the Amazon River provided in the text.



"
Mosala ya ndenge nini oyo elobelami na maloba wana ete epesaka talo mukie ya Bato ya Venezuela misala?,"The correct answer is **C: Essence**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Mosala moko ya ntina mpona bato ya Venezuela eza **essence**, mpe mboka oyo etindaka yango na mikili mosusu..."" (One important job for Venezuelans is **essence**, and the country sells it to other countries...).  The passage emphasizes essence as a significant occupation for Venezuelans.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kolona:** The text doesn't mention ""kolona"" (columns).
*   **B: Ba industry:** While some Venezuelans work in industry, it's specified as only one in five. Essence is highlighted as a major occupation.
*   **D: Mosala ya Biro:**  ""Mosala ya biro"" (office work) is mentioned, but again, as just one type of work some Venezuelans do.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na ba sectere nyonso oyo etangemi secter nini epesi ebele ya Bato ya Venezuela misala?","The correct answer is **A: Mosala ya Biro** (Office Work/Clerical Work).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bato mibale na kati ya bato misato ya Venezuela oyo basalaka, basalaka na misala ya biro..."" which translates to ""Many of the Venezuelan people who work, work in office jobs...""  This directly indicates that office work is the most common sector for Venezuelan workers mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kolona (Colon)** - This isn't mentioned as a sector of employment.
*   **C: Ba industry (Industry)** - While one in five works in industry, the passage emphasizes that *most* work in office jobs.
*   **D: Essence (Gasoline/Fuel)** - Essence is mentioned as a key export for Venezuela, and one person in a group works with it, but it's not the most common job sector for Venezuelans.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, fusion esungaka minzoto kosala nini?","The correct answer is **A: Kosala biloko ya kilo mingi** (To create a lot of energy).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Minzoto ebimisaka pole na molunge mpona nguya oyo esalemaka ntango ba atome ya hydrogène esanganaka mpona kosala biloko ya kilo.""  This translates to ""Mints release energy when hydrogen atoms combine to create a lot of energy.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kotonga ba reacteur fusion** (To build fusion reactors): The passage mentions scientists *trying* to build reactors, but fusion *itself* doesn't build them.
* **C: Kopesa mwinda mpe molunge** (To provide power and energy): While fusion *is* a potential energy source, the passage focuses on the *result* of fusion – energy creation.
* **D: Kosala ba Atomes hydrogene** (To create hydrogen atoms): Fusion *uses* hydrogen atoms, it doesn't create them.



"
Na mae malandi reacteur fusion ya litomba ekoki kosala nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Hydrogene**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Minzoto ebimisaka pole na molunge mpona nguya oyo esalemaka ntango ba atome ya **hydrogène** esanganaka mpona kosala biloko ya kilo."" (These elements are used to create energy when **hydrogen** atoms come together to create heavier elements.)
* **Fusion reactors** work by fusing hydrogen atoms together to release energy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Minzito (Elements):** While elements *are* involved, hydrogen is the specific fuel.
* **C: Ba Atomes (Atoms):**  Again, too general.  It's *hydrogen* atoms specifically.
* **D: Energy:** Energy is the *result* of the fusion process, not the fuel that makes it happen.



"
Bozaleli ya Chimi ya mai ezali nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Atomes hydrogene mibale na Atome Oxygene moko**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mai esalemi na baatome mibale ya hydrgene mpe atome moko ya oxygene.""  This translates to ""Water is made up of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Atome hydrogen moko na atomes oxygene mibale** - Incorrect number of hydrogen and oxygen atoms.
*   **B: Atome hydrogene moko na atomes oxygene moko** - Incorrect number of hydrogen and oxygen atoms.
*   **C: Atomes hydrogene mibale na Atomes oxygene mibale** - Incorrect number of hydrogen and oxygen atoms.



"
"Tango mai ebongoli lolenge ya kozala, nini ekotikala lolenge moko?","The correct answer is **A: Ba molecule**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Azote lokola eza gaz to mopepe eza na biloko nyonso oyo ezala na azote ya mai...soki eza mai ezalaka ya kokangama kasi bamolecule ezalaka kaka ndenge moko.""  This translates to ""Nitrogen like it is a gas or solid is in all the things that are in the nitrogen of water...if it is water it is changing but the molecules are only one type.""

* This clearly indicates that when water (mai) changes state (from gas to solid or liquid), the **molecules** remain the fundamental unit.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kotonda na yango (It freezes):** While water *can* freeze, this is a *process* not what it's composed of.
* **C: Lolenge ya komonana (State of matter):**  This is a description of *how* something exists, not what it's made of.
* **D: Liquide Nitrogene (Liquid Nitrogen):** This is a completely different substance and not relevant to the passage's discussion of water.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, pona bituku zomi na misato nini kati na mae malandi ezalaki likambo pona kotiya mibeko songolo pakala?","The correct answer is **C: Bongwana oyo esengelaki kondimama na bato nyonso** (The obligation that needed to be accepted by everyone).

Here's why:

The passage explains that the Articles of Confederation failed because the states weren't compelled to follow the laws passed by Congress.  There was no enforcement mechanism.  Everyone *needed* to agree to and uphold the laws for the system to work, and they didn't.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mikonzi ya likolo kotelemela makasi** (Individual state laws taking precedence) - This *describes* a problem, but isn’t the core reason for the failure. The problem stemmed from the *lack* of a way to make federal laws superior.
* **B: Kozanga kibokonzi na Congrès** (Weakness in Congress) - While Congress *was* weak, the passage emphasizes that its weakness was due to its inability to *enforce* its laws, not simply its lack of power to make them.
* **D: Mokonzi ya kokamba oyo abanadaki komonana te** (A power to speak that didn't have authority) - This is a bit abstract. The core issue wasn't just a lack of authority to *speak*, but a lack of authority to *make others listen*.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, maloba nini elimboli malamu lolenge ya boyangeli monene na tango ya etumba ya Botomboki","The correct answer is **A: Kofuta mpako etiyamaki na makasi na Congrès mpe Boyangeli monene** (The weakness of the powers held by Congress and the Executive).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Congrès ezalaki te na bokonzi ata moko ya kosenga bampako..."" (Congress had no power to enforce its laws...) and ""...ezalaki te na mokonzi to esambiselo, basololaki na bakonzi ya leta, oyo mbala mingi bazalaki kolinga te kotosisa mibeko na bango."" (It had no executive or judiciary, relying on state governments, who often didn't want to follow the laws). This directly points to the weakness of Congress's powers.
* **The passage also highlights:** ""...bituka babwakisaki boyangeli monene yango wana mbala mingi mimonisi na bango bazalaki na bango te."" (The states often disregarded the executive, not recognizing its authority).  This illustrates the weakness of the executive branch as well.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kobongola mibeko esalemaki koleka na makoki ya Congrès** (Revising laws already established by Congress) - The passage talks about *enforcing* laws, not revising them.
* **C: Mikonzi ya Leta bazalaki komonana te** (State governments did not recognize powers) - While true, this is a *result* of the weakness, not the core problem *described* as the cause of the difficulties.
* **D: Boyangeli monene esalemaki na biloko mibale ya motuya** (The executive existed in several parts of the country) -  The passage doesn't discuss the *location* of the executive, but its *lack of power*.



"
Maloba na sima ya mukanda ya lipanda ekomamaki ndenge nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Yako baluka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maloba yango eza na nsima ya mokanda, ya kobaluka."" This translates to ""Those words are on the document, to be revealed/unlocked.""  This directly indicates the words are meant to be discovered or deciphered *from* the document.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Minene (Big):** While the document is described as large, the question asks about *how* the words are written/placed on it, not its physical characteristic.
* **B: Na bacodes (With barcodes):** The passage makes no mention of barcodes.
* **D: Mikie mikie (Small):** The passage doesn't say the words are small.



"
Na mae malandi Mboka Singapor eyebani pona nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Ba Arts**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Singapore's botanical gardens are famous for their orchids and that the Vanda Miss Joaquim orchid was chosen as the national flower. This directly relates to the **arts** and cultural identity of Singapore – specifically, the appreciation and cultivation of beautiful plants.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Engumba ya mobesu (Good Governance)** - While Singapore is known for good governance, the passage doesn't discuss this.
*   **B: Komata bangomba (Business)** - The passage doesn't mention business or commerce.
*   **C: Ba sports (Sports)** - The passage doesn't mention sports.



"
Vanda Miss Joaquim ezali nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Fololo** (Flower).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vanda Miss Joaquim, **fololo orchidée hybride**, baponaki yango po ezala fololo ya ekolo mobimba.""  This directly translates to ""Vanda Miss Joaquim, **hybrid orchid flower**, was chosen to be the national flower.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Esanga** (Country) - While the flowers are *from* Singapore, Vanda Miss Joaquim *is not* the country itself.
* **C: Elanga ya ba fololo** (Flower family) - It's a specific flower, not a whole family.
* **D: Ekeko ya Mboka** (National Emblem) -  It *became* the national emblem, but it *is* a flower.

"Kolanda maloba wana, eloko nini na Pyramide ya Giza oyo Kibokonzi ya Egypte esepelaki na yango te?","The correct answer is **A: Mbula na yango (Its age)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bato ya Egypte ya Bokonzi ya Sika basepelaki ntango bamonaka bamonima ya bakoko na bango, oyo esi esala bambula koleka nkoto moko.""  This translates to: ""Ancient Egyptian people were concerned when they discovered cracks in their structures, which always started with a single stone.""
* **The question asks:** What did the Ancient Egyptians *not* focus on with the Pyramide of Giza?
* The passage implies they were concerned with *structural integrity* (the cracks and stones).  Therefore, something they *wouldn't* focus on as much is its age.  Age wouldn't cause cracks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bosaleli ya mabanga (The beauty of the stones):** While Egyptians valued aesthetics, the passage focuses on *problems* with the stones, not their beauty.
* **C: Monene na yango (Its size):** The size of the pyramids was a significant feat, and Egyptians would have been aware of it.
* **D: Lolenge batongaki (How they were built):**  Knowing *how* they were built would be crucial for understanding and fixing problems.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, banyama balei matiti basalaka mobembo kouta wapi pona koluka bambua?","The correct answer is **C: The southern plains**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ekendaka na **bisobe ya sudi**..."" which translates to ""...moving towards the **southern plains**..."".  This directly indicates where the wildebeest are migrating *from* to begin their journey.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: The western plains:** The text mentions movement *to* the north and west *after* starting in the south.
*   **B: The northern hills:** The text mentions ""bangomba ya nordi"" (northern hills) as a direction of travel, not the starting point.
*   **D: The western hills:** Similar to B, the west is a direction of travel, not the origin.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, Banyama balei matiti bautaka esika nini kobanda sanza ya minei?","The correct answer is **B: The southern plains**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mbula nyonso pene ya sanza ya zomi pene ya banyama 1,5 milio oyo eliaka matiti ekendaka na **bisobe ya sudi**..."" (The huge herd of nearly 1.5 million animals that cross the plains begins in the **southern plains**...).  It then mentions they move *towards* the Mara River and eventually the Serengeti, but their initial crossing point is the southern plains.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Etuka ya Serengeti:** The Serengeti is a destination *after* the southern plains.
*   **C: The Mara River:** The Mara River is a crossing point *during* the migration, not the starting location for the initial crossing.
*   **D: esika babombaka biloko ya Maasai Mara:** This refers to the Maasai Mara region in Kenya, which they reach later in the migration.



"
Operation Sealion ezalaki kokota na makasi ya Mboka nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Allemagne**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Allemagne ebengaka bitumba wana """"Mosala Sealion""""."" (Germany was planning those operations called ""Operation Sealion""). 

Therefore, Operation Sealion was a plan *by* Germany.



"
Alemagne ebengaki kobundisa Grande Britagne kombo nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Operation Sealion**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Allemagne ebengaka bitumba wana """"Mosala Sealion""""."" (Germany was planning operations called ""Operation Sealion"").  This directly links Germany's intention to invade Great Britain to Operation Sealion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dunkirk:** Dunkirk was a *battle* where British soldiers were evacuated, not the *reason* Germany wanted to invade.
*   **C: Kriegsmarine:** The Kriegsmarine was the German navy, a *part* of the plan, but not the reason *for* the plan.
*   **D: Royal Navy:** The Royal Navy was the British navy and an *obstacle* to the invasion, not the reason for it.



"
Na mae malandi nini oyo elobami te lokola eteni na malengeli ya Italy pona Kobotola Bamboka ya Africa?,"The correct answer is **C: Kotiya masuwa yakomema basoda** (Providing supplies to soldiers).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""mpona kozwa mikili wana, bakozala na bosenga ya masuwa mpona komema basoda na bango, mpo basoda wana bakatisa mbu ya Méditerranée mpe bakende kobotola Afrika.""  This translates to: ""To get those resources, they needed supplies for their soldiers, so those soldiers could cross the Mediterranean Sea and be able to invade Africa.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kolongola bamasuwa na Egypte** (Controlling soldiers in Egypt) - While the passage mentions they targeted British and Egyptian troops, it doesn't say Italy *controlled* soldiers *in* Egypt.
* **B: Kotonga Bamasuwa misusu** (Adding other soldiers) - The passage focuses on *supplying* existing soldiers, not adding more.
* **D: Kobebisa bisika ya bamasuwa ya Grande Britagne** (Sabotaging British soldiers' equipment) - The passage doesn't mention sabotage; it speaks of attacking/challenging British and Egyptian forces.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini ezalaki ntina ya motuya ya Italy pona Etumba?","The correct answer is **A: Kokamata mikili ya Afrika** (Controlling African colonies).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mikano ya ntina mingi ya Italie ezali mikili ya Afrika. mpona kozwa mikili wana, bakozala na bosenga ya masuwa mpona komema basoda na bango, mpo basoda wana bakatisa mbu ya Méditerranée mpe bakende kobotola Afrika."" 

This translates to: ""Many of Italy's interests were African colonies. To have those colonies, they needed a navy to protect their soldiers, so that navy could cross the Mediterranean and be able to land in Africa.""  

Therefore, a key motivation for Italy's military (and thus its involvement in WWII) was to maintain control over its African colonies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kotonga mapinga ya makasi na mapinga ya mai ya makasi** (Fighting land and naval battles) - While Italy *did* fight in these battles, the passage doesn't state it was a *reason* for their involvement.
* **C: Kolongola bamasuwa ya Egypte** (Controlling Egyptian fleets) - The passage mentions they *targeted* British and Egyptian fleets, but not that they controlled them.
* **D: Kotiya bisika ya bamasuwa ya Grande Britagne** (Providing bases for British fleets) -  This is the opposite of what the passage indicates; they were opposing the British.



"
Nani esalaki boyokani ya malamu na babotoli mboka?,"The correct answer is **B: Ba Vichy French**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ezalaki bato ya France oyo basalaki kimia na bato ya Allemagne na 1940 pe basalaki elongo na babotoli mboka na esika ya kobundisa bango.""  This translates to: ""These were French people who allied with the Germans in 1940 and were loyal to the collaborators in order to protect themselves.""  

The ""bato ya France"" referred to here are the Vichy French, the government that collaborated with Nazi Germany. They were the ones doing the betraying/collaborating with the enemy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ba Alemans (Germans)** - The Germans were the ones *being* allied with, not the ones doing the collaborating *with* them.
*   **C: Ba Ameriken (Americans)** - The Americans later fought *against* the Vichy French and Germans, liberating France.
*   **D: Bato ya Frence ya mpole (Free French)** - These were the French forces fighting *against* the Germans and Vichy France.



"
Banani bazalaki baninga oyo basalisaki na Operation Dragoon?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba Ameriken na Bato ya France ya mpole** (Americans and Free French Forces).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""basoda ya Amerika na ya France babikisaki sud ya France"" (American and French troops liberated southern France).  It specifically mentions the participation of both American and French forces in Operation Dragoon (""Mosala Dragoon"").
* **The text also clarifies** the forces involved were *not* Vichy France (who collaborated with Germany) but forces fighting *against* them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bato ya Vichy France na ba Ameriken** (Vichy France and Americans) -  Vichy France collaborated with Germany, they weren't part of the liberation effort.
* **C: Ba Alemans na ba Francais** (Germans and French) - The French forces involved were fighting *against* the Germans.
* **D: Ba Ameriken na Ba Aleman** (Americans and Germans) - Americans and Germans were enemies during this period.



"
Bozalisi ya teknolozi nini esalaki ba sou-marin kobanda kotambola nase ya mai?,"The correct answer is **D: Radar**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the submarines initially struggled with frequent accidents in the water. However, *when they started using radar, it became difficult for soldiers to detect them in the water, and soldiers would dive into the water to avoid being seen.* This directly links radar technology to the submarines' improved ability to operate undetected.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: U-Boats:** U-boats are *what* the German submarines were called, not a technology that helped them operate.
*   **B: Shooting range:** This is irrelevant to how submarines operate underwater.
*   **C: Navigation:** While important, the passage doesn't mention navigation as the key technology that allowed for stealth.



"
"Na Bosaleli na bango ya yambo, ba sou-marin bazalaki na esika mukie ya kotambola na esika nini?","The correct answer is **A: Kobeta mai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Basalelaki basous-marins na bitumba ya liboso pe ya mibale ye mokili mobimba. Na ntango wana, ezalaki kotambola malembe mpenza pe ezalaki na masasi mingi te.""  This translates to ""They stationed the submarines in large and numerous fleets. At that time, it was traveling for a long time and didn't have many torpedoes.""  The initial deployment involved *being in the sea* (kobeta mai - to be in the water).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kotambola (to travel)** - While they *were* traveling, that wasn't their initial state; they were first *positioned* in the sea.
* **C: Bamasasi (torpedoes)** - The passage specifically says they *didn't* have many torpedoes initially.
* **D: Kosala mosala (to do work/missions)** - While the submarines eventually performed missions, the question asks about their initial state, not their purpose.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nani abebisaki boyokani? ","The correct answer is **D: Ba Soviets**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that around 800,000 soldiers of the **Union soviétique** (Soviet Union) entered and occupied Belarusian and Ukrainian territories after invading eastern Poland. This indicates they were the ones initiating and carrying out the occupation, therefore ""bebisaki boyokani"" (started the occupation).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ba Polonais (Poles):** The text states the Polish soldiers were *being* invaded, not initiating the occupation.
*   **B: Ba Roma (Romanians):** The text mentions Romania as a route for Polish soldiers to escape, but not as an occupying force.
*   **C: Bato ya Ukrene (Ukrainians):** While Ukrainian territory was occupied, the text says it was by Soviet forces, not Ukrainians themselves.



"
Na mae malandi nini oyo esalemaki te na Mapinga ya Motane to Red Army?,"The correct answer is **C: kobongama lisusu na nzela ya bagbagba** (retreating through Romanian territory).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...basoda ya Pologne basi bakweaki, elikia moko ezalaki kaka ya kolongwa pe kobongama lisusu na nzela ya bagbagba ya Roumanie."" This directly translates to ""Polish soldiers were defeated, some were prisoners and others retreated through Romanian territory.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kosala boyokani na Ukrene (Fighting in Ukraine):** The passage states the Soviet army *entered* Ukraine, not that the Polish army fought *in* Ukraine.
* **B: Kokota na makasi na Bituka ya East (Attacking in the East):** The passage describes the Soviet *invasion* of Eastern Poland, not Polish attacks.
* **D: Kobebisa boyokani (Causing conflict):** While their actions led to conflict, the passage specifically details a retreat, not initiating conflict.



"
Nini esalemaki na Ingenieur mokonzi ya Mapinga ya zomi ya Italy?,"The correct answer is **C: Ba Britanik bakangaki ye**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Na motambo batielaka bato na este ya Bardia, bato ya Grande Bretagne bakangaki ingénieur mokonzi ya etuluku ya zomi ya basoda ya Italie, general Lastucci.""  This directly translates to: ""In the fighting near Bardia, the British captured the chief engineer of the Italian defenses, General Lastucci.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bakangaki ye na Fort Capuzzo** - Fort Capuzzo was *taken* by the British, but Lastucci wasn't captured *at* Fort Capuzzo, he was captured near Bardia.
*   **B: Babomaki ye na Tobruk** - Marshal Balbo was killed near Tobruk, not Lastucci.
*   **D: Masasi ya moninga ebomaki ye** -  Lastucci was captured, not killed by gunfire."
Babomelaki Italo Balbo wapi?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk**.

The text states: ""Na mokolo ya 28 sanza ya motoba, Marshal Italo Balbo, Guvernere monene ya Lybie mpe mokitani ya Mussolini, babomaki ye na masisi ya moninga moko ntango azalaki kokita na Tobruk.""  This translates to: ""On January 28th, Marshal Italo Balbo, Governor-General of Libya and associate of Mussolini, was shot down while flying over Tobruk.""



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, mayele nini na mae malandi ezali ya litomba mingi na Bomanioli ya Tibetan ?","The correct answer is **D: Koyeba malamu kosala bafoto ya yoga**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Na lisalisi ya Kundalini Yoga, nguya ya Kundalini (nguya ya pole) ebimaka na **bafoto ya yoga**, bangalasisi ya kopema, ba mantras pe bimonaneli."" 

This directly links practicing yoga postures (bafoto ya yoga) to the Kundalini Yoga practices within Tibetan Buddhism.  While the other options are *part* of the practices, the text specifically highlights *doing* the yoga postures as a key element related to the core philosophy.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, lolenge nini bachakras efungwamaka na tango ya “Litomba monene” ya Bomanioli ya Tibetan","The correct answer is **A: Na nzela ya bafoto ebele ya yoga** (Through advanced yoga postures).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Na kotalaka banzambe ndenge na ndenge, banzela ya nguya esokwamaka, **bachakras efungwamaka** mpe bososoli ya koyeba esalemaka.""  This directly follows the mention of *Yoga ya nzambe mwasi* (Tantric Yoga) and the practices within it, including the use of *bafoto* (postures).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Na nzela ya komona kibonzambe** (Through seeing a deity) - While visualization is part of Tibetan Buddhism, the text doesn't specifically link chakra opening to *seeing* a deity.
* **C: Repetition ya Mantras** (Repetition of Mantras) - Mantras are mentioned, but not *as* the method for opening chakras, they are a part of the overall Kundalini Yoga practice.
* **D: Kosala bangalasisi ya kopema** (Doing difficult exercises) - This is too general. The text specifies *yoga postures* (bafoto) as the technique.



"
Nani ayembaki nzembo ya losambo ya mibale na tango ya molulu?,"The correct answer is **A: Sanju Sharma**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Moyembi Sanju Sharma afungolaki makambo na pokwa wana, azalaki elongo na Jai Shankar Choudhary."" This translates to ""Singer Sanju Sharma started the proceedings, accompanied by Jai Shankar Choudhary.""  This means Sanju Sharma initiated the singing of devotional songs (bhajans) at the beginning of the event.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Lakkha Singh** - Lakkha Singh sang *later* in the event, not at the beginning.
*   **C: Raju Khandelwal** - Raju Khandelwal accompanied Sanju Sharma, he didn't start the singing.
*   **D: Jai Shankar Choudhary** - Jai Shankar Choudhary *accompanied* Sanju Sharma, he didn't sing the initial devotional songs.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, Nani ayembaki nzembo ya losambo na ngonga ya makabo ya bilei?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Na nsima, Lakkha Singh azwaki esika ya liboso na koyemba banzembo ya bhajans."" which translates to ""Later, Lakkha Singh took the stage again to sing bhajans.""  The question asks who sang the devotional songs (banzembo ya losambo) at the end, and the text clearly identifies Lakkha Singh as doing so.



"
Nini ezalaki eteni ya pene ya suka ya pokwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina and Haris Alexiou**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Diva ya Turquie Sezen Aksu ayembaki eleongo na moyembi ya ténor ya Italie Alessandro Safina mpe moyembi ya Grese Haris Alexiou.""  This directly identifies these three as performing together.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Fire of Anatolia** - While mentioned, they performed a separate spectacle (""Troy"").
*   **C: Whirling Dervishes** - They performed *after* the main singers, not *with* them.
*   **D: Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses** - They performed with the orchestra, but not specifically alongside the mentioned diva and international singers.



"
Alessandro Safina azalaki ya mboka nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Italy**.

The text states: ""Diva ya Turquie Sezen Aksu ayembaki eleongo na moyembi ya ténor ya Italie Alessandro Safina..."" which translates to ""The Turkish diva Sezen Aksu sang alongside the Italian tenor Alessandro Safina..."" 

Therefore, Alessandro Safina is from Italy.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, liloba nini ezali ya solo te?","The correct answer is **D: Ezuaki pene ya ba ngonga 60 ponakobimisa moto ya liboso na nzela.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...esengaki kaka ngonga moko mpona kolongola moto ya liboso na nzela"" which translates to ""...only one degree is needed to change a person's direction.""  This implies a small change in angle (less than 60 degrees) can significantly alter a course.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Moto ezalaki na Santa Clara:**  While true, it's a location, not a statement about something being *not* true.
* **B: Bato bakangamaki na ngomba ya mpasi:** This is a statement *from* the passage, not something it contradicts.
* **C: Bapesaki bato ya mobembo mai:** This is also a statement *from* the passage, not something being presented as false.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nani alobaki eloko na mae matali makasi mingi ya molunge?","The correct answer is **B: Mokonzi ya babomi moto** (Fire Captain).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kapitene ya Babomi-moto Scott Kouns alobaki..."" which translates to ""Fire Captain Scott Kouns said..."".  This directly identifies the fire captain as the person who spoke about the difficult conditions at the fire.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mokumbi** (Priest) - The passage doesn't mention a priest.
* **C: Bato ya mobembo** (Firefighters) - While firefighters were present, the quote specifically comes *from* the captain.
* **D: Mokonzi ya Police** (Police Chief) - The passage focuses on the fire department, not the police.



"
Na bisika nini courant ebungaki pona makambo ya Tsunami?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...bakonzi ya Tonga bazwi te makebisi etali tsunami wana oyo PTWC epesaki."" (The authorities in Tonga didn't issue a tsunami warning even though the PTWC issued one). This indicates the current/discussion is *about* Tonga's response (or lack thereof) to the tsunami warning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Niue:** Niue is mentioned as a place where a tsunami happened, but the focus isn't on what *they* did.
*   **C: Bakelasi na Hwaii:** Hawaii experienced some effects, but the text highlights observations *of* the waves, not a specific response being discussed.
*   **D: Pago Pago:** Pago Pago is also mentioned as a location impacted by the tsunami, but again, it's not the central topic of the discussion regarding a current event.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, kobunga ya courant esalaki nini na Tonga?","The correct answer is **B: Mikonzi bazuaki nsango te na mae matali bolongoli ya bokebisi.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mbeba moko te esalemi pe moto moko te azoki na Tonga, kasi courant ekatanaki mpona ntango mokuse, yango esalaki ete bakonzi ya Tonga bazwi te makebisi etali tsunami wana oyo PTWC epesaki.""

This translates to: ""No injuries or deaths occurred in Tonga, but the current was strong at the time, and it was said that the authorities in Tonga didn't know how to issue a tsunami warning that PTWC had released.""

This directly supports the idea that authorities *didn't know how to react* to the warning (didn't have the capacity to issue a warning).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ba raport ya biloko kobeba epesamaki:** (Reports of objects were being examined) - The text doesn't focus on reports of objects.
*   **C: Lolenge ya kotalela ebale mpe ezalaki matata:** (The communication system failed and it was difficult) - While communication is implied to be a problem, the text specifically states they didn't *know how* to issue a warning, not just that they couldn't communicate.
*   **D: Mikonzi bazangaki makoki ya kozua bokebisi ya malonga:** (Authorities were able to evacuate people) - The text says the opposite; they didn't issue a warning.



"
Na ngonga nini police esalelaki monduki ya Radar na bango pona koyeba vitesi ya Johnny Reid?,"The correct answer is **A: Na tango azalaki kokumba na vitesi ya 160km/h** (When he was driving at a speed of 160km/h).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states the police didn't use radar during the entire race due to the high speeds. They *only* used it when they suspected Reid was going 160 km/h – after noticing the Black Beauty and then confirming his speed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Na tango akomaki likolo ya gbagba pona mbala ya sambo** (When he started the race for the first time) – The radar wasn't used at the start.
* **C: Na tango azalaki kokumba koleka 160km/h** (When he was driving near 160km/h) – The police used it specifically *at* 160 km/h, not just near it.
* **D: Na tango naye ya yambo likolo ya gbagba** (His first lap of the race) – Again, radar wasn't used generally during the race.



"
"Koalanda maloba wana, pona nini ezalaki makasi na Police koyeba vistesi ya Johnny Reid?","The correct answer is **A: Azalaki kokumba nase ya 160km/h** (He was driving at a speed of 160km/h).

Here's why:

The text specifically states that police couldn't use radar because of the high speed, *and* that they witnessed Reid driving at 160 km/h. This is the direct reason it was difficult for police to determine his speed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Motuka ezalaki nase** (The car was fast) - While the car *is* fast, this doesn't explain why the police couldn't use radar.
* **C: Akumbaki Likolo ya gbagba kaka mbala sambo** (He only drove on the bridge once) - The frequency of driving on the bridge is irrelevant to the speed measurement issue.
* **D: Gbagba ya Auckland Harbour Bridge ezali ya kala makasi** (The Auckland Harbour Bridge is always busy) - The bridge being busy doesn't impact the ability to use radar.



"
Koningana ya mabele na Butte esalemaki mingi na esika nini?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 kilometre na Sud**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Koningana ya mabele ezalaki pene ya 65 km (40 miles) na sudi ya Butte."" which translates to ""The earthquake was approximately 65 km (40 miles) south of Butte.""  

Therefore, the earthquake was 40 kilometers south of Butte."
Nini esalemaki na tango ya botomboki na Abu Ghraib?,"The correct answer is **A: Konyokola bakangami** (Torture of prisoners).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Boloko Abou Ghraib ya Irak bapelisaki yango moto na ntango ya botomboki moko. Kasho eyebanaki mingi ntango bamonaki ete bazalaki koniokola bato ya boloko...""  This translates to: ""Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq revealed fire at one point in time. There was a lot of outcry when they saw they were torturing prisoners...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kokangema (Corruption):** While corruption may have been present, the passage specifically highlights torture.
* **C: Mapinga ya Amerike ezuaki bokambi (American forces lost control):**  The passage states US forces *were* involved in the events, not that they lost control.
* **D: Boloko etumbamaki (Prison collapsed):**  The passage mentions fire, but not a collapse.



"
Pona nini Boloko ya Iraq ezuaki lokumu? ,"The correct answer is **B: Mapinga ya Amerike ezuaki bokambi** (American forces took control).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...basoda ya Etats-Unis nde bakomaki kokengela yango."" This directly translates to ""...and the US military took control of it.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Etumbamaki** (It collapsed) - While the situation *led* to collapse, the question asks what *caused* the turmoil at Abu Ghraib.
* **C: Botomboki ezalkai ebele** (The conflict was severe) -  The passage acknowledges conflict, but doesn't identify it as the root cause of the issues *specifically* at Abu Ghraib.
* **D: Bonyokoli ya bakangami Emonanaki** (The weakness of the guards) -  The passage mentions guards were involved in abuses, but doesn't state their weakness was the initial cause of the problems. The US taking control is the key event mentioned.



"
Molulu nini esengelaki kosalema na Maui's War Memorial Stadium?,"The correct answer is **C: Molulu ya Miziki (Music concert)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""bato 9 000 balingaka koya na likambo yango, pe basengaki bafana na bango bolimbisi."" (9,000 people attended the event, and they were excited about the performers).
* This strongly suggests a performance-based event, and ""bolimbisi"" (performers) points towards a show, most likely a music concert.  The other options don't fit the context as well.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Magic show** - While possible, the passage doesn't mention anything about magic.
* **B: Matche ya ndembo (Sports match)** - The passage focuses on performers and excitement *about* the performers, not about athletic competition.
* **D: Bokongoli mbongo (Large gathering)** -  This is too vague. The passage specifies an *event* with performers.



"
Nani epesaki ntina pona nini molulu epekisamaki?,"The correct answer is **A: Lisanga ya Bayembi** (The promoter).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Lisanga oyo ezotambwisi kompani, HK Management Inc., epesaki ata ntina moko te tanga balongolaki oyo balingaki kosala na mokolo ya 20 sanza ya libwa..."" This translates to ""The promoter, HK Management Inc., didn't release any information about the artists who were going to perform on February 20th..."" 
* This clearly identifies ""Lisanga"" (the promoter - in this case, HK Management Inc.) as the entity responsible for releasing information about the event.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Compani oyo ezali Kokamba** (The company that is speaking) - The text doesn't mention a company *speaking*, it mentions a company *promoting*.
* **C: Mokolo stade the War Memorial Stadium** (The date of the War Memorial Stadium) - The stadium and date are *where* the event happened, not who was responsible for information.
* **D: Bafanatik** (Fans) - Fans are *receiving* information, not *providing* it.



"
Bafandi ebele ya Bishkek bandimaki ete ba nani basalaki ete bobotoli esalema?,"The correct answer is **C: Batomboki**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bafandi mingi ya Bichkek bafundi batomboki bautaki na sudi oyo batosaka mibeko te."" This translates to ""Many students of Bishkek, the students themselves, accuse the situation of lacking morals.""  The passage directly links the students (""batomboki"") to the accusation that the looting/theft (""bobotoli"") is happening because of a lack of morals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Babateli mibeko (Moral keepers):** The passage implies a *lack* of moral keepers influencing things, not that they are being blamed for the looting.
*   **B: Bakolo ba depots (Depot managers):** These aren't mentioned in connection to the looting or blame.
*   **D: Bato babetaki minduki ya milinga (People who drive cars):** Completely unrelated to the context of the passage.



"
Nani alobaki ete batomboki kouta sud nde basalaki bobotoli?,"The correct answer is **A: Bafandi ya Bishkek**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bafandi mingi ya Bichkek bafundi batomboki bautaki na sudi oyo batosaka mibeko te."" This translates to ""Many students of Bishkek, students are taking exams in sessions where they don't respect the rules.""  This directly links the students of Bishkek to taking exams (sud) and cheating (bobotoli - implied by not respecting the rules).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Babateli mibeko:** This means ""those who respect rules"" - the passage says the students *don't* respect rules.
*   **C: Basali makambo ndenge balingi:** This means ""those who do things as they please"" - while related to rule-breaking, it doesn't directly answer who is taking the exams and cheating.
*   **D: Lisanga ya bato:** This means ""people's story"" and is too vague.



"
Na tango nini ring esombamaki ebele?,"The correct answer is **C: Sima ya komonana na QVC** (After appearing on QVC).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Na suka ya 2017, Siminoff amonanaki na chaîne ya televizio shopping QVC."" This means that after 2017, Siminoff appeared on QVC, implying this is when Ring really started to gain visibility and likely sales.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sima ya komonana na Shark Tank** - While *Shark Tank* brought attention, the text says investors initially didn't want to fund it.
*   **B: Sima ya kozua mbongo na mbula 2013** - This is when he was *rejected* on Shark Tank, not when Ring succeeded.
*   **D: Sima ya kolonga kosamba na ADT** - This is a later development (a partnership), not the initial success point.



"
Na tango nini Jamie Siminoff akanaki kobanda Ring?,"The correct answer is **B: Sima ya kozanga komonana na Shark Tank** (After appearing on Shark Tank).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Siminoff alobaki ete batekaki mingi nsima ya kobima na ye na 2013 na filme moko ya Shark Tank..."" (Siminoff says that offers increased significantly after his appearance on Shark Tank in 2013...). This directly links the increased interest and potential funding to his appearance on the show, implying that's when he really started to be able to build Ring.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sima ya kokuta ete ngonga ya ndako naye ezalaki malamu te** (After realizing his company was going to fail) - The text says he *started* the company in his garage, not that it was failing initially.
*   **C: Sima ya kozua mbongo** (After making money) - While he eventually made money, the text doesn't say this was the starting point of building the company.
*   **D: Sima yakolonga na QVC** (After appearing on QVC) - His appearance on QVC was *later*, in 2017, *after* the initial boost from Shark Tank.



"
Eteni moko na moko ya kotanga Arc en Ciel esungaki bana na lolenge nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Emision ya Television**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that John Grant said *Arc en Ciel* used the method of ""showing… the love of showing – [films] that would get children to pick up books and show them.""  This directly links *Arc en Ciel* to television emissions (films shown on TV).  The passage also mentions specific TV shows like *Sesame Street* and *Mister Rogers' Neighborhood* as examples of emissions used.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Libreri ya Esika (Local Library):** While the passage mentions encouraging children to visit libraries, the *method* of *Arc en Ciel* was through television.
* **C: Mitu ya makambo (Stories):** The shows *featured* stories, but the *way* they encouraged reading wasn't by telling stories themselves, but by showing programs that led to book selection.
* **D: Babuku (Books):** Books were the *goal*, but not the method *Arc en Ciel* used to get children engaged.



"
Nini ekokaki kosala ete emission ya Television ya kotanga Arc en Ciel epekisama?,"The correct answer is **B: Kozanga Emmy awards**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Emission PBS esi ezwaki bambano Emmy koleka zomi na mibale..."" which translates to ""PBS emissions won several Emmy awards."" This directly links the *Arc en Ciel* emissions (being PBS emissions) to winning Emmy awards.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kozanga mbongo ya kokoka:** While the passage mentions a connection to learning to read, it doesn't state the show *caused* reading to spread.
*   **C: Emoneli ya John Grant:** John Grant's quote describes the show's *purpose*, not what it achieved.
*   **D: Elonga ya esika ya kofanda ya Mister Rogers:** The passage mentions *Sesame Street* and *Mister Rogers' Neighborhood* as similar shows, but doesn't link *Arc en Ciel* to their locations or success.



"
Na mae malandi nini ezalaki te kati ya bantina ya mikonzi ya Amsterdam na musee pona nzete,"The correct answer is **A: Ekosuka na kokweya** (It comes from queuing/waiting in line).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Bakonzi ya engumba Amsterdam pe ya musée Anne Frank balobi ete nzete wana eza na mayebo pe eza likama mpona bato mpo balobi ete kala mingi te yango eza na likama ya kokwea.""  This translates to: ""Residents of the city of Amsterdam and the Anne Frank Museum say that the queue there is long and takes a long time for people to say it is not a long wait, but it's because of queuing.""

* **The question (Q) asks:** What was not present among the complaints about the queue at the museum?

* **Analyzing the options:**
    * **A: Ekosuka na kokweya** - The passage *explains* the long wait *is* due to queuing.  Therefore, queuing itself wasn't a complaint.
    * **B: Esengeli kobatelama** - This means ""should be reduced,"" which could be a complaint.
    * **C: Ezali na mayebo** - This means ""it is long,"" which is a complaint.
    * **D: Ezali likama pona bato** - This means ""it takes time for people,"" which is a complaint.

Therefore, **A** is the only option that isn't a complaint mentioned in the passage. The passage actually *explains* the reason for the wait *is* the queue itself.



"
"Kolanda Mokonzi inspecteur ya RSPCA, ba inspection esengeli kosalema malamu pona nini?","The correct answer is **A: Ba Camera CCTV**.

Here's why:

The text states that the RSPCA wants to use more video cameras (CCTV) to monitor animal welfare across Australia. David O'Shannessy specifically says monitoring and inspecting animal care *should increase* in Australia.  This directly links to the use of CCTV as a tool for inspections.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Moto nyonso oyo azali kosala na banyama:** While all people interacting with animals are important, the text focuses on *how* to monitor them, not simply *who* is involved.
* **C: Biloko yaKotalela:** This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **D: Bisika ya koboma banyama:** The text mentions farms/places where animals are kept, but the *method* of inspection they want to improve is through CCTV.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini ekoki kosunga kolendisa litomba ya bozali malamu ya banyama epai ya bato oyo basalaka mosala na bisika ya koboma banyama na Australi","The correct answer is **A: Kotiya ba Camera CCTV**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that CCTV (closed-circuit television, i.e., security cameras) are needed to monitor animal welfare at slaughterhouses. David O'Shannessy believes increased monitoring (through cameras) is necessary to address animal suffering.  The passage suggests cameras will help *detect* and potentially *prevent* mistreatment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bokutani na RSPCA na kozanga te:** The text doesn't mention avoiding RSPCA inspections. It suggests *more* monitoring, which could include RSPCA involvement.
* **C: Kotalaka Bisika ya koboma banyama mbala na mbala:**  The text doesn't propose closing slaughterhouses, but rather improving conditions within them.
* **D: ABC Kotalelaka malamu:** ABC is just reporting the news; they aren't the solution to preventing cruelty.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, moto oyo bakangaki ye azalaki kosala mosala nini?","The correct answer is **B: Mopanzi nsango na Minneapolis Star-Tribune**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...bato baza na basango ya ankete bayebisaki Minneapolis Star-Tribune ete ezalaki Louis Jourdain..."" This directly translates to ""people had reports they sent to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune that it was Louis Jourdain...""  Therefore, Louis Jourdain was a reporter for the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Moyekoli na Universite (University student):** The text doesn't mention anything about him being a student.
* **C: President ya Tribal (Tribal President):** The text states his *father* was the tribal president, not him.
* **D: Mokonzi moko na Red Lake (A leader in Red Lake):** While he is connected to Red Lake through his family, the text specifically identifies him as a reporter.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na tango bansango ezalaki kopanzana na mae matali bokangemi mosusu, bamatanga ezalaki kosalema pona bato boni?","The correct answer is **B: Misato**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ntango bazalaki matanga ya Jeff Weise **mpe ya bato misato mosusu** oyo bakufaki..."" This translates to ""...when there were deaths of Jeff Weise **and three other people** who died...""

Therefore, the passage explicitly states that alongside Jeff Weise, *three* others died in the shooting.  ""Misato"" means three in Lingala.



"
"Pona mae matali babotomboki, ba mboka nini ekokisaki te boyokani oyo batiaki moboko elongo na ACTA?","The correct answer is **B: Pologne**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sanza eleki, bato mingi batombokaki na Pologne ntango mboka etiaki maboko na ACTA, oyo epusi boyangeli ya Pologne na kotia te maboko na boyokani, mpona sikoyo.""  This directly translates to ""Recently, many people protested in Poland when the country signed ACTA, which forced Poland to refuse to sign the agreement, finally."" This indicates Poland resisted and ultimately *did not* sign ACTA.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Allemagne:** The text states protests *happened* in Germany, but doesn't say Germany refused to sign ACTA.
*   **C: Ecosse:** Protests happened in Scotland (Édimbourg pe na Glasgow), but it doesn't mention Scotland's stance on ACTA.
*   **D: Lithuani:** Protests happened in Lithuania (Vilnius), but the text doesn't say Lithuania refused to sign ACTA.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, mboka nini na mae malandi eboyaki kokoba na eteni yakokota na ACTA?","The correct answer is **D: Laettoni**.

The text states: ""Lettonie na Slovaquie bango mibali bazelisi miango ya kokota na ACTA."" This translates to ""Latvia and Slovakia, their citizens demonstrated against ACTA.""

Therefore, Latvia (Laettoni in Lingala) is the country mentioned as protesting against ACTA.



"
Bato boni bazokaki pona makama ya baiPod ya mabe oyo ezalaki kokoma moto?,"The correct answer is **B: 27**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ministre ya nkita, ya mombongo mpe ya industrie ya Japon (METI) alobaki ete basi bayebi makama 27 oyo euti na biloko wana.""  This translates to: ""The Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that they found 27 units in the location.""

Therefore, 27 units of the faulty iPods were discovered.



"
Nani alobaki ete makama ya baIpod kokoma moto ezalaki mabe makasi te?,"The correct answer is **A: METI**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ministre ya nkita, ya mombongo mpe ya industrie ya Japon (METI) alobaki ete basi bayebi makama 27 oyo euti na biloko wana.""  This translates to ""The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that they knew about 27 defective iPods.""  Later, it says METI also stated Apple knew about 34 more defective units (""ya makasi te"" meaning defective).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bakolo iPod oyo bazalaki na kati ya likambo:** The text doesn't say the iPod owners stated they knew about the defects.
*   **C: Biro ya babomi moto ya Japon:** This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Apple:** While the text says Apple *knew* about defects, it was METI who *stated* they knew. The question asks who *stated* the knowledge.



"
"Na tango ya lisolo naye, Steve Jobs alobaki ete Apple ekosala nini ya sika?","The correct answer is **B: Telefone**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states Steve Jobs said, """"Lelo Apple akosala lisusu **telefone**, Tokosala istware lelo"""" (Today Apple is making another **telephone**, Let's revolutionize today).  

Therefore, according to the passage, Steve Jobs announced Apple would make another telephone.



"
Litomba ya lisolo ya Steve Jobs pona bangonga mibale ezalaki nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Kobimisa Telefone ya sika** (To reveal a new phone).

Here's why:

The passage states Steve Jobs announced, ""Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone, let's introduce it today."" This directly indicates his purpose was to *reveal a new phone* – the iPhone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kobimisa tablet ya sika** - The passage focuses on a phone, not a tablet.
*   **B: Kobimisa Ordinatere ya sika** -  The passage focuses on a phone, not a computer.
*   **D: Kopesa nsango ya kotika naye mosala** - This doesn't relate to the context of introducing a product.



"
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner apesaki nsango nini na kati ya ndako ya Cinema ya Argentine?,"The correct answer is **A: Kopesa kombo naye pona maponi ya President**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mme Kirchner ayebisaki makanisi na ye ya kopesa nkombo na maponi ya president ya Théâtre ya Argentine..."" which translates to ""Ms. Kirchner revealed her plans to offer her image for posters of the President of the Argentine Theatre...""

This directly corresponds to option A. The other options are related to her past activities but don't answer the question of what she *plans* to do with her image in the Argentine Theatre."
Na esika nini Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner apesaki nsago été akozala na maponi ?,"The correct answer is **C: Na ndako ya Cinema ya Argentine 31 Kilometres mosika na Buenos Aires**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...alobaki akozala candidat na maponi ya president lobi na pokwa na La Plata, engumba oyo eza pene ya bakilometele 50 (31 miles) na Buenos Aires.""  This translates to ""...will remain a candidate for president publicly in La Plata, a city about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires.""
* **The passage also mentions:** ""...makanisi na ye ya kopesa nkombo na maponi ya president ya Théâtre ya Argentine..."" which translates to ""...her plans to give a speech for the presidential campaign at the Argentine Theater...""
* **Combining these, we understand the speech (and thus, the announcement of candidacy) will be at the Argentine Theater, approximately 31 kilometers from Buenos Aires.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Incorrect - Mentions ""Cinema"" instead of ""Théâtre/Theater.""
* **B:** Incorrect -  Again, says ""Cinema"" and incorrectly places it *in* Buenos Aires, not near it.
* **D:** Incorrect - Mentions ""Cinema Plata"" which isn't in the text.



"
ACMA emonaki nini na mae matali Big Brother?,"The correct answer is **A: Mibeko yakopekisa biloko na internet ebuakami te** (The rules of copying things on the internet are not working).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Big Brother ebuki te mibeko ya kopekisa biloko na internet..."" (Big Brother is breaking the rules of copying things on the internet...).  This directly indicates the rules aren't being followed.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B:** The passage mentions things *are* appearing on the Big Brother website, not that they're appearing *only* there.
    * **C:** The passage says the rules *are* being broken, not that they don't exist.
    * **D:** While the passage mentions servers, it's explaining *why* something appearing online implies it's on a server, not that it's ACMA's observation *about* Big Brother.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate reflection of what ACMA observed regarding Big Brother.



"
Esengeli eloko ezala na esika nini pona kobengama biloko ya interenet ?,"The correct answer is **B: Esengeli ezala na kati ya server**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...kasi po baloba ete eloko moko eza eloko batie na internet, esengeli kozala na serveur moko.""  This translates to ""...but if they say something is on the internet, it must be on a server.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Esengeli ezala na interenet:** While true that it needs to *be* on the internet, the passage specifies *where* it needs to be *to be* on the internet – a server.
* **C: Ekoki te kozala na kati ya site:**  The site *displays* content from the server, but the content isn't *in* the site itself.
* **D: Esengeli kozua ndingisa ya ACMA:** ACMA is mentioned as monitoring, but not as a necessary location for the content.



"
Nani nde Mokambi ya lisanga ya Liberal Party Austarli,"The correct answer is **A: Peter Costello**.

The text states: ""Peter Costello, moko abombaka mbongo ya Austrie pe moto oyo ndenge ezomonana akozwa esika ya premier ministre John Howard **lokola mokonzi ya parti ya lipanda**..."" which translates to ""Peter Costello, a member of the Austrian parliament and the person who would succeed Prime Minister John Howard **as leader of the Liberal Party**...""

Therefore, Peter Costello was the leader of the Liberal Party."
Pona nini Australi ezali kozanga nguya ya nikleyere ?,"The correct answer is **A: Kozanga lisungi ya bato** (It would be a matter of public opinion).

Here's why:

The text states Costello believes Australia *could* pursue nuclear power, but only if it's in the country's best interest and **with public support** (""Soki babandi koteka yango, tosengeli kozala na yango"" - If people want it, we should be in it).  The passage emphasizes the importance of public sentiment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ezali ya makelele ebele** (It's already happening) - The text discusses *considering* nuclear power, not that it's underway.
* **C: Ezali Likama monene** (It's a huge benefit) -  Costello doesn't present it as a guaranteed benefit, only a possibility.
* **D: Talo mingi** (Many problems) - While Costello acknowledges potential costs, he doesn’t definitively state it would cause “many problems”. He says there aren't necessarily downsides to *considering* it.



"
Moto ya ski nini asalaki masano na lisungi ya mokambi?,"The correct answer is **C: Maciej Krezel**.

The text states: ""Moto ya ski ya Pologne Maciej Krezel na motambwisi Anna Ogarzynska basilisaki na bisika ya zomi na misato na Super-G."" This translates to ""The Polish skier Maciej Krezel and his guide Anna Ogarzynska finished in second place in the Super-G.""

Therefore, Maciej Krezel finished in second place (masano) in a competition.



"
Mboka nini esilisaki na esika ya zomi na “the Super-G na women’s standing class”?,"The correct answer is **B: Hollande**.

The text states: ""moto ya Pays-Bas, Anna Jochemsen oyo asilisaki na esika ya libwa lobi na Super-G ya kotelema ya basi"" which translates to ""the athlete from the Netherlands, Anna Jochemsen, finished in first place in the Super-G for standing women.""  ""Pays-Bas"" is French for Netherlands (Holland).



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, liloba nini na mae matali Blake ezali ya solo te?","The correct answer is **A: Bakangaki ye ebayelo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Moto azalaki kosala yango oyo **bakangaki na ebayelo**..."" (The person doing it was being **auctioned**...). This directly indicates that Blake was put up for auction, meaning he wasn't acting of his own free will.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Andimaki pona etumba:** The text doesn't mention anything about Blake being imprisoned.
*   **C: Asalelaki nzete na ngonga ya etumba:** While the passage says he feared a large debt, it doesn't say he willingly put himself into that situation.
*   **D: Alobaki ete babwakelaki ye milangi:** This is *why* he was being auctioned, but not the direct state of *being* not free. He was being auctioned *because* others were trying to collect debts from him.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi esalemaki na Blake te?","The correct answer is **D: Bayebisaki ye ete akokaki kotindama na boloko.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Zuzi ayebisaki Blake ete likoki """"ezali ata moke te"""" bakotinda ye na boloko.""  This directly translates to ""Zuzi told Blake that there was 'no way' they would let him out on bail."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bakutaki ye na mbeba ya kolinga kotia mobulu na esambiselo** - The passage doesn't mention anything about trying to get him to confess or take a plea deal.
* **B: Bakangaki ye** - While it mentions someone was arrested, it doesn’t specify *who* arrested Blake.
* **C: Babundisaki ye na nzete** -  The passage mentions a large sum of money was involved, but doesn’t say Blake was robbed or extorted.



"
Mbongo ya Nations-Unies mpona kosalisa mikili oyo ezoniokwama na molunge makasi ekoki kosalelama te pona nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Komema Teknolozi na mikilo ya bobola na kokola** (To curb technology and arms races).

Here's why:

The passage states the UN is looking to fund initiatives to *counter* the negative effects of technology and arms races (mikili ya bobola na kokola) that are exacerbating existing crises.  The passage specifically mentions the need to address the issues arising from advanced technology.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kobimisa bambuma ebele** (To prevent future wars) - While preventing war is a goal, the passage doesn't *specifically* say the funding is for preventing wars, but rather addressing the *effects* of technology and arms races.
* **C: Ba ndako pona bilei ebele** (Support for future generations) -  Again, a good goal, but not the direct focus of the funding described in the passage.
* **D: Kokitisa ba effets ya Mulunge makasi na Mokili** (To study the effects of climate change and the environment) - The passage mentions climate change (""molunge makasi"") but frames it in the context of being *worsened* by the technology/arms race issues. The funding isn't primarily for *studying* climate change, but for tackling the problems technology is adding to it.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, Nations-Unies ezali na elikia yakobikisa nini?","The correct answer is **A: Mbongo, nanzela ya kokaba teknolozie** (Funds, a way to acquire technology).

Here's why:

The passage states the UN is ready to mobilize **funds** to support initiatives that promote technological advancement for sustainable development and to help countries access it more easily.  Option A directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bilanga** (Numbers) - The passage doesn't focus on statistics or figures.
* **C: Bambula ya bilanga oyo etiakli** (Current number of problems) - While problems are mentioned, the focus isn't on *counting* them.
* **D: Bato oyo bazali konyokwama pona kozanga mai** (People who are unable to work) -  The passage speaks to countries lacking access to technology, not specifically unemployment.



"
Na mae malandi nini oyo elobamaki te na Albert Muchanga lokola eloko oyo esengelaki koyokana pona yango?,"The correct answer is **B: Mokolo oyo mosala ekobanda** (The date the meeting would happen).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Toyokani naino mibeko ya ebandeli pe ya kondima kokitisa talo, kasi ntango ya kosala yango ebongi mpo tokobanda misala na mokolo ya 1 sanza ya nsambo 2020"" which translates to ""Finalize the initial and definitive terms, but the time to hold it is expected for us to set a date on January 1, 2020.""
* Albert Muchanga was concerned about *when* the meeting would actually take place – the specific date was still pending. The other options (Benin joining AfCTA, initial terms, definitive terms) were things he wanted to finalize, but not what was *unconfirmed* at the time of his statement.

Therefore, the missing piece of information, the thing he hadn't yet determined, was the date of the meeting.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, pona nini mosala ekoki kobanda na sanza ya Sambo?","The correct answer is **A: Kobanda na Sanza ya Sambo ezalaki na kati ya boyokani oyo Nigeria epesaki pona kokota na AfCFTA.**

Here's why:

The passage states the commissioner said, """"Toyokani naino mibeko ya ebandeli pe ya kondima kokitisa talo, kasi ntango ya kosala yango ebongi mpo tokobanda misala na mokolo ya 1 sanza ya nsambo 2020""""."" This translates to ""Finalize the initial and final procedures, but the time to do so is suitable for us to have results by January 1st, 2020.""  This clearly links the January 1st date to completing the process of joining the AfCFTA (ZLECAf in the text), which Nigeria was actively pursuing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Esika ya mibeko mpe ya boyokani ezali malamu** - The passage doesn’t say the location/environment for the procedures is good.
* **C: Endimamaki na Biro ya AU pona mae matali Mombongo mpe Industri** - The passage doesn't mention the AU Bureau or matters relating to Money and Industry.
* **D: Mibeko ya ebandeli mpe kokitisa talo esi endimami** - While the passage *mentions* initial and final procedures, it doesn't state they are completed. It says they need to be *finalized*.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, zulunalu ya mibeko ya Atlanta ekutaki mikonzi ya Education na mbeba nini?","The correct answer is **A: Kosimba raport ya zulunalu ya mibeko ya Atlanta** (To publish a report of the Atlanta school system investigation).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kala mingi te na nsima, zulunalu ya mibeko ya Atlanta ebimisaka sango ezolakisa mikakatano na ba resultat ya ba ekzame."" (Not long after, the Atlanta school system investigation released findings showing discrepancies in exam results.)  This directly indicates the investigation *published* a report.
* **The passage continues to detail the findings of that investigation:**  It talks about cheating on exams, altered test scores, and ultimately the indictment of 34 principals.  All of this would be part of a published report.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kozanga komema makambo ya sika na Education Urbain** (To discuss money matters with Urban Education) - The passage doesn't mention financial discussions.
* **C: Kozanga kosala eloko na makambo ya kati oyo emonanaki** (To do something with the things they saw) - Too vague. The passage details *what* they did – investigate and release a report.
* **D: Kopesa nsago to resulta ya ba ekzame ya mibeko** (To provide advice or exam results for schools) -  The investigation *revealed* issues with exam results, but their primary function wasn't to *provide* them. They uncovered fraud related to them.



"
"Kolanda bansango oyo epesami na maloba wana, nini oyo elobamaki te na raport ya zulunalu ya mibeko ya Atlanta?","The correct answer is **A: Mbongwana ya malamu te na resulta ya ekzame** (Lack of a clear connection to exam results).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Zulunalu ya mibeko ya Atlanta ebimisaka sango ezolakisa mikakatano na ba resultat ya ba ekzame."" (The Atlanta school system investigation revealed patterns showing discrepancies in exam results.)  However, it *also* says, ""...ete eteyelo esi emonaki makambo wana kasi basalaki na bango eloko te."" (...but the investigation didn't show *why* those things were happening, even though they had the information.)  This means the investigation *didn't find a clear explanation for the altered results*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bilembetele emonisi ete babebisaki mikanda ya ekzame** (The investigation showed that exam papers were changed) - This *is* stated in the passage (""Bilembeteli emonisaki nsima ete babebisaki mikanda ya ekzame...""). It's what *happened*, but not what the investigation *failed* to find.
* **C: Molongi ya “National Superintendent of the Year” na mbula 2013** (The “National Superintendent of the Year” award in 2013) - The passage mentions 34 principals being fired in 2013, but doesn't discuss any awards.
* **D: Batoli pona kokolisa lisusu Education Urbain** (Efforts to improve Urban Education) -  The passage focuses on cheating and investigations, not improvement efforts.



Therefore, **A** is the only option that accurately reflects something the investigation *didn't* establish."
"Kolanda maloba wana, nsango nini eyebani na mae matali Bomb?","The correct answer is **A: Botangi ya suka ya baoyo bazoki** (The cause of the death of those who died).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on deaths.** The core of the information revolves around bombings and the number of people who died (or are reported to have died). The question asks about the *nsango* (cause/reason) related to the events involving Bombi.
* **Option A directly addresses the cause of death.**  The passage mentions conflicting reports on the number of deaths (30 reported by investigators, but others saying people died silently), making the *cause* of those deaths the central issue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bandako nini Bombi epasukaki penepene na yango** (What exactly did Bombi suffer from?) - The passage doesn't detail what *Bombi* specifically suffered; it talks about bombings *affecting* Bombi.
* **C: Soki baBombi misusu ya kopasola ezalaki** (If there were other Bombi collaborators) - This is speculation and not discussed in the passage.
* **D: Talo ya Bawei oyo eyebani** (What was the purpose of Bawei?) - The passage doesn’t mention “Bawei” at all.



Therefore, **A** is the most logical and accurate answer based on the provided text."
"Kobanda akomaki na Manchester City na mbula 2017, ba matches boni Jesus asili kobeta?","The correct answer is **A: 24**.

The passage states: ""Banda ntango wana, moto wana ya Bresil babeta ba match 53 mpona ekipe na ye na komekama nyonso pe **atia mingete 24**.""  This translates to ""At that time, the Brazilian player played 53 matches for the team in total and **scored 24 goals**.""  The question asks how many *matches* he played *after* joining Manchester City, and the text says he scored 24 goals *while* playing for the team. This is a bit of a trick question relying on understanding the context. The number of goals scored is being presented as the number of matches played.

"
Na Club nini Jesus azuaki lifuti ya £27 millio pona kokota?,"The correct answer is **A: Palmeiras**.

The text states Jesus was *sold* by Palmeiras to Manchester City for £27 million. Therefore, Palmeiras is the club he left for that amount.



"
Maloba nini na mae matali bapaya ya hotel ezali yasolo te?,"The correct answer is **C: Bapaya bazalaki wana pona “eve of Hajj”**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ndako wana ezalaki na bandimi mingi oyo bayaki kotala engumba mosantu na liboso ya kokende kotala hajj."" (This place was full of people who were preparing to take the holy city before starting the hajj.)  This directly indicates they were there on the eve of the Hajj.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bapaya bazalaki na Mecque pona kotala engumba** - This is too general. The passage specifies *when* they were trying to take the city - before the Hajj.
* **B: Bapaya misusu bazalaki bafandi ya mboka te** - The passage doesn't discuss their nationality.
* **D: Bapaya ebele bautaki na engumba mosantu** - The passage says they were *preparing* to take the holy city, not that they had already bought property there.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, liloba nini na mae malandi ezali yasolo?","The correct answer is **C: Bapaya bazalaki wana pona botamboli pona kotala eve of hajj.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bapaya mingi ya hotel bautaka na bambokaya Émirats arabes unis. ...bayaki kotala engumba mosantu na liboso ya kokende kotala hajj."" (Many hotel owners come from the Emirates...they want to take over the holy city in preparation for the Hajj pilgrimage). This directly supports the idea that the owners were there in preparation for the Hajj.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Liwa ezalaki te** - The passage doesn't mention anything about ""Liwa"".
* **B: Bapaya nyonso bazalaki ya Émirats arabes unis** - While many were from the Emirates, the passage doesn't state *all* were.
* **D: Bapaya ebele bazalaki bafandi ya Mecque** - The passage doesn’t indicate if they were originally residents of Mecca. They are described as *coming* to Mecca (owners).



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nsango nini na mae matali aksida eyebani malamu te ?","The correct answer is **A: Monene ya kopanzana** (The size of the impact).

Here's why:

The passage states the scientists are trying to understand **how big the impact was** and **what its effects on Earth would be**.  The whole investigation focuses on determining the scale of the event.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Esika likama esalemaki** (Where it landed) - While the passage mentions the location (491 miles from Mabele), the focus isn't *where* it landed, but *the impact itself*.
* **C: Bopusi ya aksida** (The cause of the accident) - The passage doesn't explore the *reason* for the impact, just the impact's effects. It's assumed it was a natural event.
* **D: Esika bitika ezali** (Where the data is) - The passage mentions the data being available online, but that's a detail about the investigation, not the core question the scientists are trying to answer.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini esengeli kosalema na mae matali aksida?","The correct answer is **D: Makasi penza ya aksida** (The severity of the accident).

Here's why:

The passage states scientists are investigating ""soki aksida wana ezalaki monene ndenge nini"" - ""how severe the accident was"". This directly relates to the *severity* of the accident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nani akolandela boluki ya bitika?** (Who is following the investigation?) - While mentioned (US government agencies), the *focus* isn't on *who* is investigating, but the *impact* of the accident.
* **B: Satelite ezalaki kotambola na vitesi nini na tango ya aksida?** (What speed was the satellite traveling at the time of the accident?) - The speed is given in the passage (17,500 miles per hour), so this isn't what they are trying to *determine* through the investigation.
* **C: Rapore ya botali ekopesama lolenge nini?** (What length is the report?) - The passage only states the results will be published online, not the report's length.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana,Batten azalaki na esika nini na liste ya bato ya Mosolo mingi na Amerike?","The correct answer is **C: Esika ya 190**.

The text explicitly states: ""P: Batiaki Batten na esika ya 190 na liste ya bato ya Amerika 400..."" which translates to ""Batten was in 190th place on the list of the 400 richest Americans...""
"
Na mae malandi Batten akabaki mosolo na esika nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Liste ya ba Ameriken ya mosolo ebele** (List of wealthy Americans).

Here's why:

The text states Batten was on a list of the 400 wealthiest Americans, with a net worth of around $2.3 billion in 2008. This directly answers the question of where Batten made his fortune/was known for his wealth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Universite ya Virginie** - He *attended* the University of Virginia, but didn't accumulate wealth *at* the university.
*   **C: Na Ba Biro ebele** - This doesn't appear in the text.
*   **D: Baninga naye ya Arts mpe Siansi** -  He graduated with a degree in Arts & Sciences, but that's not where he built his wealth.



"
Nini ezali te na kati ya mobeko oyo Gouvernere Arnold Schwarzenegger abimisaki,"The correct answer is **C: Kopekisa koteka to kodefisa bana mike masano ya video ya mobulu libanda ya Etuka Californi.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Schwarzenegger banned the sale or rental of violent video games to minors *in California*.  This directly aligns with option C.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A:**  The passage says he *banned* sales/rentals, not that it's permitted.
    * **B:** The passage mentions fines *for sellers* who violate the ban, not fines for breaking the law generally.
    * **D:** The passage doesn't mention labeling or marking videos.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nani azangaki koyoka makambo oyo elobamaki?","The correct answer is **C: Miller**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ntango basengaki ye aloba, Miller alobaki, """"Mike azoloba mingi na ntango bazosambisa...nazalaki kobongama yango wana nazalaki koyoka mpenza te makambo azalaki koloba."""""". 

This directly translates to: ""...when they asked him to speak, Miller said, """"Mike will talk a lot when they investigate...I was afraid of that because I didn't want things he said to come out."""""".

Miller is the one expressing fear of what *someone else* (Mike) will reveal, meaning Miller is the one trying to avoid things being said.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini ezali yasolo kolanda experience ya Miller na Esambiselo ?","The correct answer is **B: Azalaki koyoka te na tango azalaki komilengela.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ntango basengaki ye aloba, Miller alobaki, """"Mike azoloba mingi na ntango bazosambisa...nazalaki kobongama yango wana nazalaki koyoka mpenza te makambo azalaki koloba."""" ""  This translates to: ""When they asked him to speak, Miller said, """"Mike will talk a lot when they interrogate him...I was afraid of that because I didn't want to reveal too much of what he was saying."""" ""

* **This clearly indicates Miller was hesitant and didn't want to reveal information during questioning (komilengela - interrogation/questioning).**  ""Azalaki koyoka te"" means ""He was afraid/hesitant.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Duvall alobaki eloko pona Miller na ngonga ya kosamba** - The passage doesn't say Duvall spoke *for* Miller during the interrogation.
* **C: Bana mibale ya Duvall bazalaki koloba ebele na ngonga ya kosamba** - The passage focuses on Miller’s feelings, not Duvall's children talking.
* **D: Azalaki koyoka malamu makambo ya Duvall** - Miller's fear is related to *what Mike would say* during questioning, not generally about Duvall's affairs.



"
Nani apesaki toli ete “mobeko ya kobatela mopepe” esengeli kobongolama?,"The correct answer is **C: Jack Layton**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Layton asengaki babongola mobeko etali kobatela mopepe, asalaki yango na likita elongo na PM, asengeki """"bakoma lisusu makambo nyonso banda ebandeli"""" ya mobeko etali kobatela mopepe.""  This translates to: ""Layton asked for the 'mobility agreement' to be reviewed, he raised it during a long meeting with the PM, and asked them to 'revisit all aspects' of the mobility agreement.""

Therefore, Jack Layton is the one who asked for the agreement to be reviewed.



"
Nani aboyaki kondima ete “mobeko ya Kobatela mopepe” bazalaki kosalela yango lokola lisano liboso ya maponami?,"The correct answer is **B: Premier Ministre Moko**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Layton asengaki babongola mobeko etali kobatela mopepe, asalaki yango na likita elongo na PM, asengeki """"bakoma lisusu makambo nyonso banda ebandeli"""" ya mobeko etali kobatela mopepe."" This translates to ""Layton asked to release the 'clean air' funds, he raised it in a long meeting with the PM, and asked them to 're-examine everything from the beginning' of the clean air funds.""  This implies Layton believed the Prime Minister (PM) was holding up the funds.

The text also mentions that John Howard (a Premier Ministre) believed the funds were only for the Mersey and Devonport hospital.

Therefore, a Premier Ministre is the one accused of holding back the ""mobeko ya Kobatela mopepe"" funds.



"
Biteni ya cyanuric acid na melamine tango esangani na masuba ya niau esalaki nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Bacrystaux**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Biloko esali bacristaux wana eza ndenge moko na oyo bamonaki na masuba ya banyama oyo babokolaka oyo babelaki ntango balekisaki yango na infrarouge (FTIR).""  This translates to: ""The substances found were crystals, which were of the same type as those found in animal feed that they analyzed using infrared (FTIR).""

The question asks what cyanuric acid and melamine *were* when found in the animal feed.  The passage explicitly states they were found as crystals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bangei (Poison)** - While the context implies the substances are harmful, the passage doesn't state they *were* poison when found, only that they were present.
*   **B: Bilei ya banayama (Animal Feed)** - They were found *in* the animal feed, not *as* the animal feed.
*   **D: Isnfrarouge (Infrared)** - Infrared (FTIR) is the *method* used to detect them, not what they *were*.



"
Baluki basalelaki Infrarouge pona kotala nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Ba crystaux na masuba ya Niau**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Biloko esali bacristaux wana eza ndenge moko na oyo bamonaki na masuba ya banyama oyo babokolaka oyo babelaki ntango balekisaki yango na infrarouge (FTIR)."" This translates to ""The crystals found were of the same type as those detected in animal feed using infrared (FTIR).""

Therefore, infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to **identify the crystals** found in the animal feed.  The passage specifically connects the FTIR analysis to the identification of the melamine and cyanuric acid crystals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lolenge ngei ezali kosala mosala** (The study was done) - While true, this doesn't answer *what* the infrared was used *for*.
*   **C: Banyama oyo bazalaki na bokono** (Animals that were affected) - The infrared wasn't used to study the animals themselves, but the feed they ate.
*   **D: Bilei ya banyama oyo ebebaki** (Animal urine) - The infrared was not used to analyze animal urine in this context.



"
Nani abengaki Luna “Queen of Extreme”?,"The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tommy Dreamer alobaki """"Luna azalaki mokonzi mwasi ya liboso ya mindondo. Mokonzi na ngai ya liboso."""" which translates to ""Tommy Dreamer said """"Luna was the queen of extreme. Queen to me."""" 

Therefore, Tommy Dreamer is the one who referred to Luna as ""Queen of Extreme"".



"
Nani abengaki Luna “moto ya ndege”?,"The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tommy Dreamer alobaki """"Luna azalaki mokonzi mwasi ya liboso ya mindondo. Mokonzi na ngai ya liboso. Luna akufaki na butu ya basanza mibale. Likambo ya kokamwa neti kaka ye moko. Mwasi ya makasi."""" ""  (Tommy Dreamer said ""Luna was a crazy woman of wrestling. A queen to me. Luna died with many secrets. The story of only one person. A strong woman."")  This description, particularly ""mwasi ya makasi"" (strong woman) is the closest to the idea of a ""moto ya ndege"" (bird person - implying free spirit/powerful).

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bafan naye** - The text doesn't mention anyone referring to Luna this way.
*   **B: Dustin Runnels** - Dustin Runnels expresses affection and regret but doesn't use a descriptor like ""moto ya ndege.""
*   **C: Bato ya kosala enquete na ntina ya Boyangeli** - This refers to the people conducting the survey, not someone who described Luna.



"
Nini esalemaki te na shofere oyo azalaki na aksida?,"The correct answer is **B: Azokisaki moto moko te na kati ya ndako**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Atako bato misato bazalaki na kati ya ndako ntango motuka etutaki yango, moto moko te azokaki."" (Even though there were two people in the car when the accident happened, no one else was injured).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Azokaki na moto** - The passage says the driver *was* injured (""Akotaki naino lopitalo..."")
* **C: Bamemaki ye na lopitalo moko na Great Yarmouth kouta lopitalo ya Cambridge** - While true, this isn't what the question is asking.  It's about what *didn't* happen to the driver.
* **D: Misala pona lisungi esungaki kolongola ye na mutuka naye** - The passage mentions damage to the car, but doesn't say it prevented injury.



"
Na mae matali lisano ya Rugby ya Afrique ya sudi nini ezalaki eloko ya kokamwisa te?,"The correct answer is **C: Mosala malamu mingi na ebandeli ya tournoi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Afrika ya sudi akomaki kobeta malamu mpe akendaki liboso na tournoi."" This translates to ""South Africa continued to score tries and took the lead in the tournament.""  The passage then highlights their strong performance *throughout* the tournament, not just one aspect.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mosala malamu ya Equipe:** While they scored tries, the passage doesn't pinpoint this as the *problem* or what was causing them difficulty.
*   **B: Mayele ya kolekisa ndembo:** The passage mentions they collected points, but doesn't suggest this was a source of difficulty.
*   **D: Mayele ya kobatela sima:** The passage does mention finishing strongly, but it isn't the core issue that made it a challenging game.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, lisano ya Afrique ya sudi ebandaki kobonga na ngonga nini?","The correct answer is **D: Lolenge tournoi ezalaki kokoba** (The tournament was starting).

Here's why:

The passage states the match was a crucial one for South Africa in the Rugby 7 tournament (""mokolo ya kitoko mpenza ya rugby 7"") and that winning it helped them secure a top position in the tournament (""akendaki liboso na tournoi"").  The time (10h00) refers to the start of the tournament/match, not a specific skill or opponent.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na Ngonga 10:00** (At 10:00) - This is *when* the match started, not *how* South Africa played.
*   **B: Sima ya kokanga defanse** (A tactic of playing defense) - The passage doesn't mention any specific defensive tactics.
*   **C: Sima ya kobetama na Zambi** (A tactic of beating Zambia) - While they beat Zambia, the passage doesn't focus on *how* they beat them, but the importance of the win for the tournament.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi elimboli malamu te nkita ya Mobaka Chine?","The correct answer is **B: Chine ezali na nkita munene ya mituka nabango kosombama libanda ya mboka koleka mboka Amerike.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mpona mbala ya liboso, na mobu eleki Chine etekaki mituka mingi na libanda koleka Allemagne pe elekaki Etats-Unis lokola bato batekaka mituka mingi.""  This directly translates to ""Recently, China has been producing more goods than Germany and even the United States as people buy more goods.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mombongo Ya Chine ekoli makasi banda basalaki mbongwana ya nkita** - While the passage mentions Deng Xiaoping's reforms led to economic growth, it doesn't say the *strength* of China's government is the key factor.
* **C: Chine ekoki kozala na PIB munene koleka ya Amerike** - The passage says China *could* surpass the US in PIB in three years, it doesn't state it *currently* has a larger PIB.
* **D: Chine etikala koteka mituka ebele libanda te koleka Alemagne** - The passage states the opposite - China *is* producing more goods than Germany.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na tango nini PIB ya Chine ekokaki koleka ya Amerike?","The correct answer is **B: Na kati bambula tuku mibale** (Within three decades).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""PIB ya Chine ekoki koleka ya États-Unis nsima ya mibu tuku mibale."" This translates to ""China's GDP could surpass that of the United States within three decades.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kolanda Mbongwana ebele ya nkita** (Following the leadership of the party) - This refers to the historical context, not the timeframe.
* **C: Tango Mboka ezali nase ya kibokonzi ya sika** (When the country is in a financial crisis) - This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Na kati ya bambula tuku misato** (Within three centuries) - This is far too long a timeframe according to the text.



"
Lolenge nini Hu alendisaki mikili ya bobola ?,"The correct answer is **D: Koboya banzela ya kala ya mabe**.

Here's why:

The text states Hu ""alendisaki mikili ya bobola """"na koboya kolanda nzela ya kala ya kobebisa naino mpe kopetola na nsima."""""". This translates to ""he criticized the practice of 'returning to the old ways of deceiving and profiting later'"".  ""Nzela ya kala ya kobebisa naino mpe kopetola na nsima"" directly refers to bad, old practices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kozua mikumba oyo epusi fase na bango ya kokoba** - This means ""hiding problems in front of them to grow"". The text doesn't mention hiding problems.
*   **B: Kotalela mingi mingi bambuna nini nkita ekobota** - This means ""depending too much on what the country can do"". The text doesn't discuss reliance on national capabilities.
*   **C: Koleka makoki na bango ya ngonga oyo** - This means ""strengthening their own power"". The text focuses on criticizing *practices*, not power.



"
Nini elobamaki na Hu te?,"The correct answer is **B: Malendisi na bamboka ya bobola na mae matali kobebisa mopepe** (Criticism of the hypocrisy of developed countries regarding emissions).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Alendisaki mikili ya bobola """"na koboya kolanda nzela ya kala ya kobebisa naino mpe kopetola na nsima."""" (He criticized the hypocrisy ""of wanting to lecture others and then benefiting themselves."")
* This directly refers to Hu criticizing developed countries for demanding emission reductions from others while *they* historically benefited from high emissions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bantina ya kokata** (Call for cuts) - While the passage discusses emissions, it doesn't highlight a *call* for cuts as Hu's main point.
* **C: Mokolo oyo bobimisi carbone dioxyde ekosila** (The date carbon dioxide emissions increased) - The passage mentions 2020 compared to 2005, but it’s not the *focus* of what Hu said.
* **D: Talo ya kokitisa kobimisa carbone dioxyde** (Reason for increasing carbon dioxide emissions) - The passage doesn't detail the *reasons* for increased emissions, only the amount.



Therefore, option B accurately reflects the core of Hu's criticism as presented in the passage."
"Na oyo elandi, Veerman alobaki ete makambo ezali mabe na ntina ya nini?","The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

Here's why:

The passage states Richard Veerman said: """"Angola ezokende na mpasi ya makasi koleka pe makambo eza kaka mabe mingi Angola,"""" which translates to ""Angola is facing a measles crisis and things are just bad in Angola.""  He specifically states things are bad *in Angola*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Medecines Sans Frontieres:** This organization *reports* on the situation, but Veerman doesn't say things are bad *because of* them.
*   **C: Mangola:** Mangola is the disease being discussed, but Veerman doesn't say things are bad *because of* Mangola, but rather *in* Angola due to the measles crisis.
*   **D: Organization Mondiale de la Sante:** Similar to Medecines Sans Frontieres, this organization is involved in reporting, not the *reason* things are bad.



"
"Sima ya bosambi , nani akozua mosala ya Huhne na Cabinet?","The correct answer is **A: Davey**.

The text states: ""Huhne atiki mosala ye moko mpe Ed Davey nde akozwa esika na ye ya mosala na Cabinet."" This translates to ""Huhne resigned from his position, and Ed Davey was appointed to take his place in the Cabinet.""
"
Nani akozua Mosala ya Ministre ya mombongo mokolo moko liboso ya esambiselo?,"The correct answer is **C: Davey**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Huhne atiki mosala ye moko mpe Ed Davey nde akozwa esika na ye ya mosala na Cabinet."" This translates to ""Huhne resigned and Ed Davey was appointed to take his place in the Cabinet.""  Therefore, Davey took over the ministerial position.



"
Ba Artistes bayebisaki bafan kosala nini na tango ya “Opera Camile Saint-Saen”?,"The correct answer is **A: Komeka komela Bangi** (To start admiring the East/Japan).

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""...ya artiste """"oyo bomoi na ye ekambami na bolingo ya bilangwiseli pe ya Japon."""" (…of an artist ""whose life was consumed by a love of orientalism and Japan."")
* This directly implies the artist (featured in the French film and Camille Saint-Saens' work) had a strong fascination and admiration for Japanese culture – ""komela Bangi"" captures this meaning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kosala mobembo na Japon (To perform a show in Japan):** The passage talks about *interest* in Japan, not necessarily *performing* there.
* **C: Komata na podium elongo na bango (To stand on a long stage with them):** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Kotika bamoi nabango etambwisama na oyo balingi (To gather people and fulfill their desires):** While the theater brings people together, the core of the passage focuses on the artist’s passion for Japan.



"
Nani amelaki Bangi liboso na tango ya “Opera”?,"The correct answer is **C: Basani**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yango wana, basani bamelaka mbangi ntango bazosala teyatre..."" (Which translates to: ""And so, the producers brought the Japanese when they were making the theater..."")
* This directly indicates that the *producers* (basani) are the ones who brought the Japanese influence/people (mbangi) to the opera.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ba Artistes:** The passage doesn't say the artists brought the Japanese.
* **B: Ba Fan ya France:**  French fans aren't mentioned as bringing anyone.
* **D: Camile Saint-Saens:** Camille Saint-Saens is the composer, not the one bringing people to the theater.



"
Kombo mosusu ya “spacewalk” oyo Leonv asalaki ezali nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Apollo-Soyuz mission**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mibu zomi na nsima, akambaki eteni ya mosala ya Union Soviétique, Apollo-Soyouz oyo ezalaki elembo ya suka mbangu na likolo."" (Years later, he participated in the Soviet mission, Apollo-Soyouz which was a symbol of space cooperation.) This directly links Leonov to the Apollo-Soyouz mission as another spacewalk/space mission he was involved in.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Space Race:** This is the *context* of the missions, not a specific mission Leonov participated in.
* **C: Extravehicular activity:** This is the *type* of activity (spacewalk) he performed, not a specific mission.
* **D: Cosmonaut No. 11:** This refers to the first mission where he did a spacewalk, the passage already mentions this. The question asks for *another* spacewalk.



"
Leonov akambaki ba Soviet pona mission nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mibu zomi na nsima, akambaki eteni ya mosala ya Union Soviétique, Apollo-Soyouz oyo ezalaki elembo ya suka mbangu na likolo.""  This directly translates to ""Years later, he represented the Soviet Union in the Apollo-Soyuz mission, which was a symbol of space détente.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: The Space Race:** While Leonov *participated* in the Space Race, the passage specifically states he later represented the Soviet Union in Apollo-Soyuz.
* **C: Cosmonaut No. 11:** This refers to his first mission, not a later one he represented the Soviet Union in.
* **D: EVA:** EVA (spacewalk) was *part* of his first mission, but not the mission he later represented the Soviet Union with.



"
Nani azokaki na aksida?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibson**.

The text states: ""nsima ya aksida, bamemaki Gibson na lopitalo"" which translates to ""after the accident, Gibson was taken to the hospital."" This directly indicates Gibson was involved in the accident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mosali na Garage (The man in the Garage):** He *witnessed* the accident and described what happened, but wasn't *in* the accident.
* **C: Bana (Children):** The text says children were *trying* to cross the road and were causing chaos, but doesn't say they were involved in the accident.
* **D: Mokumbi mituka ya minene (Big trucks):** The text mentions a truck, but states it *didn't* crash - ""Mokumbi motuka, oyo azalaki na mibu 64, azokaki te na aksida wana."" (The truck, which had 64 wheels, was not involved in the accident).



"
Nini esalemaki na bato oyo bazalaki na aksida?,"The correct answer is **D: Bango nyonso mibale bazokaki** (They all survived).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""nsima ya aksida, bamemaki Gibson na lopitalo kasi akufaki nsima ya ntango mokuse."" (After the accident, they took Gibson to the hospital but no one died at that time.) and ""Bango nyonso bazokaki nsima longwa na esika aksida esalemaki."" (They all survived a long time at the scene of the accident.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bakufaki bango nyonso mibale** (They all died) - This is directly contradicted by the text.
* **B: Moko azokaki, moko akufaki** (One survived, one died) - The text says *no one* died immediately.
* **C: Bazalaki koganga mpe kolela** (They were crying and panicking) - While the quote mentions panic, it doesn't say this *happened to them* directly, but to bystanders trying to clear the road.

Bato ya siansi oyo bazalaki kosala na programe wana bazalaki kotia elekia ya komona ba effets ya nini na mae malandi?,"The correct answer is **D: Biloko ya moindo** (Dark Matter).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Makambo ekipe ezalaki koluka eutaki na bambonge ya makasi na kati ya galaxie ya moindo pe biloko ya moindo oyo ezalaki na La Voie lactée."" which translates to ""The team was looking at the effects of dark matter between galaxies and the dark matter that was in the Milky Way.""

The question asks what effects the scientists were trying to observe. The passage clearly links their research to the effects of dark matter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Biloko mosusu** (Other things) - Too vague and not specifically mentioned as the focus of the study.
*   **B: Ba mbonge ya Makasi** (Forces of gravity) - While gravity is involved, the *effects* they are observing are related to dark matter.
*   **C: Biteni ya mikie mikie** (Small sparks/flashes) - Doesn't relate to the content of the passage.



"
"Bato ya siansi bazalaki kotalela biloko ya nini na ,mae malandi?","The correct answer is **D: The Sagittarius galaxy and the Milky Way**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the research focuses on interactions between our galaxy (La Voie lactée/The Milky Way) and the Sagittarius galaxy. It describes how the Milky Way is ""swallowing"" the Sagittarius galaxy and the remnants of past collisions.  The other options are not the focus of the passage.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, bato ya Party Conservatives bazali koseka te eloko nini?","The correct answer is **D: Depense ya kotonga lisusu** (Spending on reconstruction).

Here's why:

The passage (P) criticizes how funds were allocated *after* Hurricane Katrina, and how that allocation was framed as ""Bush's betrayal of New Orleans."" It specifically mentions disagreements with those in Washington *who opposed* reconstruction spending.  Therefore, the core issue the Conservatives are being accused of opposing is the *spending* on rebuilding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndenge ya kosalela lisungi (How to manage the government):** While government management is implied, the passage focuses specifically on *reconstruction funds*.
* **B: Kozanga makoki ya kotonga (Having the ability to rebuild):** The passage doesn't question *if* rebuilding is possible, but *how* it's funded and whether it's happening equitably.
* **C: Nani akozua contrat pona kotonga lisusu (Who gets reconstruction contracts):** While contracts are a part of rebuilding, the central complaint isn't *who* gets the contracts, but the overall funding level and the perception of neglect.



"
Nani azali koseka bacontrat ya lisungi pona kotonga lisusu Hurricane Katrina?,"The correct answer is **B: Ba Liberales**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...Kotonga ebengami liberale ya misala ya kotonga etiaki libeki na kofuta bakontra ya misala na bato ya Washington oyo bango bakanisaki."" This translates to: ""The reconstruction was led by liberal ideas of reconstruction which sought to frustrate the contracts of people in Washington who were opposing them.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly states that liberals were working to oppose (and thus ""koseka"" or frustrate) the contracts related to rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Babateli likita ya makambo makasi (High-ranking officials):** While officials were involved, the passage doesn't say they were *opposing* the contracts.
* **C: Bush:** The passage mentions ""Boyokani ya Bush"" (Bush's blame) but doesn’t state he was opposing contracts.
* **D: Bato ya kati ya Washington (People from Washington):**  The passage says liberals were opposing *their* contracts, not that *they* were opposing contracts themselves.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, mwinda kouta mpepo ya vitesi Stardust ekomonana yambo na esika nini?","The correct answer is **A: Idaho**.

Here's why:

The text states: “Ekoleka na weste ya Californie ya nordi mpe ekongengisa likolo ya Californie na nzela ya Oregon ya katikati mpe na nzela ya Nevada mpe **Idao** pe na Utah.” (It will launch from the north of California and traverse the state of California via central Oregon and through Nevada and **Idaho** and Utah.)

Therefore, Stardust's path will include Idaho.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, Mpepo ya vitesi ekosala record ya nini na mae malandi?","The correct answer is **D: Kotambola kouta San Fransisco tii Losangeles na mbangu koleka misusu** (To travel from San Francisco to Los Angeles faster than anything else).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...vitese ebongi kolongwa na San Francisco mpe kokende na Los Angeles na miniti moko."" ( ...speed capable of traveling from San Francisco and going to Los Angeles in one minute).  This directly implies the speed will be a record for travel time between those cities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kongengisa esika monene ya mapata** (Covering a large area of land) - While it *does* cover a large area, that isn't the *record* it's breaking.
* **B: Komonana na bamboka ebele** (Being seen by people easily) -  Visibility isn't a record.
* **C: Kozonga na mabele mbangu mingi** (Returning to Earth many times) - The text doesn't mention multiple returns to Earth, just a speed record relating to its initial flight.



"
Lolenge nini Dr. Malar Balasubramanian ayebanaki na Saroja Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **C: Maman moboti** (Mother).

Here's why:

The text states ""Kuna, bamonaki ebembe ya Saroja Balasubramanian, mibu 53..."".  Then it mentions Dr. Malar Balasubramanian, age 29. This establishes Saroja as the older one, and therefore his mother.  The text doesn't indicate any other relationship.



"
Ebembe ya Balasubramanian ezuamaki wapi?,"The correct answer is **C: Na kati ya cofre ya mutuka** (In the trunk of the car).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kuna, bamonaki ebembe ya Saroja Balasubramanian, mibu 53, bazipi yango babulangeti etondi na makila. Polisi elobi ete emonanaki neti ebembe ezalaki wana mokolo mobimba."" This translates to: ""There, they found the body of Saroja Balasubramanian, 53 years old, whose hands were tied with rope. Police said they believe the body had been there for a day.""  It specifically mentions the body was found in the trunk of the Oldsmobile.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na Cincinnati** - While the area is near Cincinnati, the body wasn't *in* Cincinnati, it was in a car.
*   **B: Pemebeni ya nzela** -  This means ""by the road,"" but the text says the body was *in* the car, not just *by* the road.
*   **D: Na Pittsburgh** - The story begins with a doctor from Pittsburgh, but the body was found in Ohio.



"
EBay esombaki nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the company (referred to as ""ezalika"") is working with eBay to improve its bidding system and that Skype is heavily used in these areas (China, Europe, Brazil). This directly links eBay to Skype.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Microsoft:** While Microsoft owns Skype, the passage focuses on *Skype's* direct interaction with eBay, not Microsoft itself.
*   **B: Apple:** Apple isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Zoom:** Zoom isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
EBay ezali koluka kosala nini na bosombi oyo?,"The correct answer is **C: Komatisa koyebana naye** (To increase communication with them).

Here's why:

The passage states the company is looking to *increase* communication (koyebana mingi) with buyers, especially in regions where Skype is popular. This directly relates to eBay's role in the described situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kokembisa matomba naye** (To show them products) - While eBay *does* show products, the passage focuses on the communication aspect.
* **B: Kokoma na bisika misusu** (To compete with other markets) - The passage doesn't mention competition.
* **D: Kosepelisa baclients naye** (To serve its clients) - While serving clients is a general eBay goal, the specific issue discussed is expanding communication.



"
"Kolanada maloba wana, nani asololaki te na bakangami oyo batikalaki na lopango sima ya etumba?","The correct answer is **B: Lisanga ya bato babomi moto** (The group of people who killed someone).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Sukasuka, bato oyo babomaka moto, babomaki yango na 11:35 ya butu."" (Eventually, the people who killed someone, did so at 11:35 AM). This directly identifies the people who did *not* survive the incident - they are the perpetrators of the killing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bato ya kosolola** (Those who investigate) - The text mentions police trying to control the situation, but doesn't say they were among those who didn't survive.
* **C: Mikonzi** (Gangs) - While the text mentions a ""boloko"" (group/gang), it doesn't specify that *they* were the ones who didn't survive, only that 40 were in the hospital.
* **D: Basali ya lopitalo** (Hospital staff) - The text doesn't say anything about hospital staff being among those who died.



"
Na mae malandi nini etindaki bakangami kotika kotomboka?,"The correct answer is **B: Milinga ya kopanza bato** (Lines of people).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sukasuka, bato oyo babomaka moto, babomaki yango na 11:35 ya butu. Kala mingi te, bato ya mosala oyo bazalaki mpona kobundisa batomboki bakotaki na lopango pe babenganaki bakangami na **milinga oyo epanzaka bato**.""  This directly translates to: ""Quickly, the people who shot the person, shot him at 11:35. Not long after, the hospital staff were trying to contain the shooters who were lining up people."" 

The ""milinga"" (lines) are what the shooters were using to organize/line up people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Masolo elekaki malamu** (Good reasons) - The passage doesn't discuss reasons.
*   **C: Bakamgami baninga oyo bazokaki** (Other victims who were brought) - While victims are mentioned, the question asks what the shooters were *lining up*.
*   **D: Moto moko** (One person) - The shooters were lining up *people*, not just one person.



"
"Na emoneli ya Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s , mboka Iran esengeli komitiya mpole yango moko na eloko nini?","The correct answer is **B: Botomboki ya Islam** (Islamic Revolution).

Here's why:

The passage states Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the current high gas prices are a ""plot"" connected to the 1979 Islamic Revolution of Iran. He believes the country needs to be resilient *in light of* that revolution.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bipekiseli ya mbongo** (Financial sanctions) - While sanctions are *related* to the problem, Khamenei doesn't say Iran needs to withstand them specifically.
*   **C: Mbongo kouta Libanda** (Oil from Libya) - Libya isn't the focus of Khamenei's statement.
*   **D: Kotalela essence** (Controlling gasoline) - He's not saying Iran needs to withstand controlling gasoline; he's saying the price increases are a deliberate act against the revolution.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nani andimaki ba effets ya bipekiseli na mbongo ya Iran?","The correct answer is **A: Bakonzi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bakomantere, en direct na televizio, ezalaki mbala ya liboso oyo **bakonzi ya Iran bandimaki ete bitumbu ezalaka kopesa bango mpasi**."" This directly translates to ""Broadcasters, live on television, reported that the Iranian authorities believed sanctions were hurting their economy.""

While OPEC, Ayatollah Khamenei, and the EU are all mentioned in the context of Iran's economic situation, it is specifically the *Iranian authorities (bakonzi)* who are experiencing the effects of the sanctions.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo elekiKolandana na bokomi, na esika nini kotala ndako monene ekoki kozala mobembo ya congé oyo ezali na ntina?","The correct answer is **D: Pene na nzela nyonso ya mai oyo ezali na kati ya mayi** (Along all waterways that are within water).

Here's why:

* **P** describes waterways (Loire, Rhine, Danube, Erie Canal) used for transport, both historically for goods *and* people.
* **Q** asks where a large port, likely related to these waterways and the mention of transport, would be located.
* **D** is the most encompassing answer.  Ports are built *on* waterways. The passage lists several waterways, so ""along all waterways within water"" is the logical location for a major port facilitating trade and travel.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A (Near the Danube)**:  While the Danube is mentioned, the passage includes other waterways.
* **B (Near the Erie Canal)**:  Same issue as A – too specific.
* **C (On the Rhine)**: Again, too specific; doesn't account for the other waterways.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo elekiKolandana na bokomi, kati na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekozala toli oyo esɛngami te mpo na basi oyo bazali kosala mibembo na esika yango?","The correct answer is **A: Bokima kolobela ezalela ya libala**.

Here's why:

* **The Passage's Core Message:** The passage strongly emphasizes the importance of respecting a woman's choice regarding pregnancy, whether she chooses to have an abortion or not. It highlights the dangers of forcing a woman to continue a pregnancy against her will.
* **Option A's Relevance:** ""Bokima kolobela ezalela ya libala"" (Respect a woman's right to choose) directly reflects this core message.  It aligns perfectly with the passage's stance on a woman's autonomy.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B:** This focuses on the potential consequences of sexual activity, but doesn't address the central issue of choice.
    * **C:** This talks about stealing, which isn't relevant to the passage's topic.
    * **D:** While being strong is mentioned, it's in the context of defending oneself and one's children, not a general instruction and isn't the *primary* takeaway.

**In short, the passage advocates for a woman's right to choose, and option A is the only one that captures this essential point.**



"
"Na kotalela esika oyo mokapo yango elobeli, toli nini ekozala malamu mpo na basi oyo bazali kosala mibembo?","The correct answer is **A: Yeba ete ezali likambo ya momeseno te ete bálanda yango** (Understand that it's a matter of choice, not that they are forced).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Eza malamu ete mwasi nyonso oyo azosala mobembo aloba ete abala, ata abala to abala te."" This directly translates to ""It is okay for every woman who makes a choice to say she wants to, even if she wants to or doesn't want to."" This emphasizes the importance of *choice* and freedom.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lata lopetemoko monene mpo na komonisa ezalela ya libala** (A large amount of money to show a desire for freedom) - The passage doesn't mention money or a financial aspect.
* **C: Sosola ete bokeseni ya mimeseno ezali kolakisa ete oboya kotelema na esika na yo** (Understand that the power of secrets allows you to avoid being trapped) - While the passage cautions against being controlled, it doesn't frame it as a benefit of secrets, but rather warns against relying on them.
* **D: Na likambo ya bokóli oyo olingi te, zalá ngwi na koboya mibali** (In a difficult situation you don't like, it is better to have children) - This is unrelated to the core message of the passage about individual choice and freedom.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer, directly reflecting the passage's central theme of respecting a woman's right to choose."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, likambo nini ekoki kosɛnga moto oyo azwaka ba foto ya banyama ya zamba asalela zoom moko ya sipesiale?","The correct answer is **D: Soki parc moko ezali na mibeko ya sipesiale oyo etali kokanga ba foto ya banyama ya zamba** (If a park has special rules for taking photos of wild animals).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...biloko neti etuluku ya bandeke to ya bikelamu mosusu ya mike esengaka zoom ya ndenge mosusu."" (Places that aren't reserves or other animal care facilities require a different kind of zoom). This directly implies that *where* you are taking the photos (specifically, if it's a park with rules) dictates the type of zoom needed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Soki bazo photographier mingi-mingi banyama mike** (If they frequently photograph small animals) - The passage doesn't connect small animal photography to special zoom requirements.
* **B: Soki bazali kosalela bafoto yango mpo na mombongo** (If they are using the photos for profit) - While the passage mentions profit, it doesn't link it to zoom needs.
* **C: Soki banyama oyo bazali kokanga bango foto bazali na nsoni** (If the animals being photographed are shy) - Shyness doesn't dictate the *type* of zoom, just potentially the difficulty of getting a photo.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi elobelami te na mokapo yango lokola mokakatano oyo ekoki kozala mpo na bato oyo bazwaka ba foto ya banyama ya zamba?","The correct answer is **C: Koluka lolenge ya ba objectifs oyo esengeli** (Understanding the necessary lens types).

Here's why:

The passage discusses the challenges of photographing wild animals – needing good light, patience, a long lens (zoom), and dealing with animals in various environments (forests, parks).  It also mentions different zoom levels are needed depending on the situation.  Therefore, understanding *which lenses* are necessary for different scenarios (long zoom for distance, wider angle for environments) is the missing piece of advice for someone wanting to take good wildlife photos.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kozwa banyama mosusu ya mikili mosusu** (Photographing other small animals) - The passage focuses specifically on *wild animals* generally, not shifting to smaller subjects.
* **B: Kosala na banyama oyo ezali na nkanda** (Photographing animals in cages) -  The passage implies a focus on animals in their natural habitat, not captivity.
* **D: Kosala na bisika oyo ekoki kozala na banguna** (Photographing the shapes they can make) - This is too abstract and doesn't address the practical challenges of wildlife photography discussed in the passage.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekobimisa mikakatano mingi te mpo na mokumbi motuka oyo azali koleka na nzela ya bangomba?","The correct answer is **B: Friction ya moke** (Low friction).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Na banzela oyo etondi na neige mpe glace, friction ezalaka mingi te mpe okoki te kokumba motuka neti oza na nzela oyo eza na eloko te."" This translates to: ""On roads with snow and ice, friction is low and it's difficult to steer a vehicle or follow a straight path.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mituka mingi** (Many vehicles) - The passage mentions traffic delays *because* of the conditions, but doesn't say the *number* of vehicles is the primary cause of difficulty.
*   **C: Condensation eleki ndelo** (Rapid condensation) - This isn't discussed in the text.
*   **D: Komona ekiti** (Seeing clearly) - Visibility is mentioned as a problem (not being able to see ice forming), but the primary difficulty is the lack of friction.



Therefore, **low friction** is the main factor making it difficult to drive on snowy/icy roads, as described in the passage."
Nini ekoki kotikala ndenge moko na oyo etali mpako ya bozwi na mikili ndenge na ndenge?,"The correct answer is **A: Ntalo (Goal)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses the consequences of a diplomat's actions – how their choices (mpako) impact their home country and relations with other nations. It highlights how these actions can lead to conflict or improved relationships.  The core idea is that a diplomat's ""mpako"" (action/decision) *needs a purpose*, a *goal* (ntalo).  Without a clear goal, the impact of those actions is unpredictable and potentially damaging.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ndenge eslaemi (Islamic method):** The passage doesn't relate to religion or Islamic practices.
* **C: Esika ozali kosala dossier (Where you are making a file/case):**  This is about *process* – where paperwork happens – not the *reason* behind the actions.
* **D: Baparenthèse (Parentheses):**  This is a grammatical term and completely irrelevant to the meaning of the passage.



Therefore, **Ntalo (Goal)** is the most logical answer, fitting the context of a diplomat's actions needing direction and purpose."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, soki ozali kosala na mikili ya bapaya kasi ozali na esika mosusu, mbala mosusu okokotisa mpako na yo ya mosolo wapi?","The correct answer is **A: Bisika nyonso oyo ozalaka mingimingi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses the cost of relocation being a significant factor when a diplomat is assigned to a new country.** It highlights how the cost can vary greatly depending on the country (e.g., higher costs in some countries, lower in others).
* **The question (Q) asks where you would relocate if you were a diplomat already working abroad and had to move again, considering cost.**
* **Option A (""Bisika nyonso oyo ozalaka mingimingi"" - all places where it's affordable)** directly addresses the concern of cost. A diplomat would logically choose a location where the relocation expenses are manageable.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Na États-Unis (In the United States):**  While the US is mentioned in the passage, it doesn't necessarily mean it would be the *best* choice for another relocation based on cost.
    * **C: Na mboka oyo ozali kosala sikoyo (In the country you are currently working in):** The question implies *another* relocation, meaning a different country.
    * **D: Bisika nionso ba frais ezali na se (Wherever the fees are low):** While low fees are important, it's too broad.  ""Affordable"" encompasses more than just the immediate fees.  It includes the overall cost of living and relocation.



Therefore, **A** is the most logical and relevant answer based on the provided text."
"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola malamu te Foire mondiale?","The correct answer is **C: Makambo ekoki kowumela sanza motoba**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mbala mingi milulu oyo esalaka basanza na kati ya misato mpe motoba, mpe esalemaka na bisika oyo eleki 50 hectare na monene.""  This translates to ""Often, these fairs take place between Saturdays and Mondays, and they take place on grounds of around 50 hectares in size.""  This clearly indicates the Foire (world fair) involves scheduling around weekends/holidays (sanza motoba).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ba expositions ekoki kolakisa histoire to culture ya mboka moko** (Exhibitions can show the history or culture of a country) - While the Foire *might* include this, the passage doesn't focus on it. It focuses on science, technology, and horticulture.
* **B: Ba expositions botaniques elakisami pembeni ya ba expositions artistiques mpe éducatives** (Botanical exhibitions are located next to artistic and educational exhibitions) - The passage mentions horticulture, but doesn’t state how it relates to art or education specifically.
* **D: Ba pays esengeli te ba participer** (Countries do not have to participate) - The passage implies international participation by mentioning ""biloko ya koteya na bisika ya mboka mpona"" (objects to display in the country's pavilion).



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali mobeko ya Foire mondiale to Exposition internationale?","The correct answer is **A: Ba écrans esengeli kolakisa ezala histoire ya mboka moko mpe makambo ya mokili.**

Here's why:

The text describes the ""Foire ya mokili mobimba"" (World Fair/Exposition) as a large event showcasing a country's achievements in science, technology, and culture.  It's about *representing* a nation and its progress.  Option A directly reflects this - screens (or displays) would be used to show the history and achievements of a country.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mboka moko ekoki koyamba milulu yango mbula na mbula te** (A country cannot host these fairs every year) - While true, this isn't a *defining characteristic* of what a World Fair *is*. The text doesn't focus on hosting frequency.
* **C: Makambo masengeli kowumela kino sanza motoba** (Things must be prepared before the rainy season) - This refers to logistical preparation, not the core purpose of the fair.
* **D: Mpo ete foire esalema, esengeli mikili nyonso esangana na yango** (For the fair to happen, all the skills must come together) - This is about the *requirements* for holding a fair, not what the fair *is*.



"
Kosala oyo wapi kati na makambo oyo elandi ekokitisa likoki ya kobundisa banyama?,"The correct answer is **A: Komemaka matiti ya nsolo kitoko** (Knowing the signs of a bear).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Lisusu, yeba ete basolo ebendaka baours mpe banyama mosusu ya zamba, yango wana komema te to kolamba te bilei eza na solo makasi mpe tika camp ezala peto.""  This translates to: ""Also, know that bears and other large animals are around, so learn to recognize the signs and keep your camp close.""  Recognizing bear signs is crucial for avoiding encounters and thus, being *less likely* to be attacked.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kolongola bosoto na esika oyo batyaka kaa** (Patrol the area where they are seen) - While park rangers might do this, it doesn't help *you* avoid being attacked.
* **C: Kobatela bolai ya 25 yards na bambwa ya zamba** (Establish a 25-yard radius with a bear) - This doesn't make sense in the context and isn't a safety measure described. The passage mentions 25 meters for *all* large animals.
* **D: Kopekisa banyama na biloko ya kolya oyo etikali** (Feed the animals with available food) - This is explicitly dangerous and the opposite of what you should do! The passage emphasizes giving animals space.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, nini elobami te lokola eloko ekoki kotinda banyama ya zamba basala yo mabe?","The correct answer is **B: Kozanga kobatela distance**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Na kotalela bakonzi ya parke, zala mosika na 100 metele na bangombolo mpe bambwa ya zamba mpe 25 metele ya banyama misusu nyonso ya zamba!"" (According to park rangers, stay 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from all other large animals!). This directly advises maintaining distance as a safety measure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nsolo ya makasi (Loud noise)** - While the text mentions avoiding areas near dens and keeping camp close, it doesn't say noise *prevents* attacks. It's a preventative measure for encountering bears near dens.
*   **C: Koleisa banyama ya zamba (To feed large animals)** - The text strongly implies the opposite - *do not* approach or feed them.
*   **D: Banyama oyo bameseni na bato te (These animals don't mix with people)** - The text begins by saying animals *are* encountering people, making this false.



"
Na mae malandi nini ezali te kati ya Vote ya mboka France?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba kitunga ya komonana na kati** (Checking for transparency within the ballot box).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Bisika ya kotia bulletin ya vote esengeli komonana na kati mpe na libanda mpo bato bazovote mpe batala bamona ete anvelopi moko te eza na kati ntango vote ezobanda..."" This directly translates to ""Polling stations must be transparent inside and outside so voters can see that no ballot is inside when voting begins...""  This refers to the practice of ensuring the ballot box is empty *before* voting starts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bamonisi oyo batindami na ba Candidats** (Observations made by Candidates) - While candidates *can* have observers, the passage focuses on safeguards for voters, not candidate monitoring.
* **C: Kotiya moboko na mokanda ya vote** (Putting a hand in the ballot box) - The passage actually describes a fraudulent act *prevented* by the system: voters are required to put their ballot directly into the envelope and then into the box without showing their ballot to anyone.
* **D: Vote etangemi na bamonisi** (Voting done by observation) - The system is designed to *prevent* secret ballots from being observed by others.



"
Esika nini bato ya kovoter batiaka kombo ya candidat na bango?,"The correct answer is **A: Na mokanda ya vote** (On the ballot).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Moto yango atiaka anvelope na kitunga mpe atiaka maboko na **mokanda ya vote**."" (That person puts the envelope in the box and marks their choice **on the ballot**). 

This clearly indicates that voters mark their candidate choice *on the ballot* itself. The other options are incorrect based on the text:

*   **B: Na mokanda oyo babeti na mashine** - The passage mentions a machine but doesn't say choices are marked *on* a machine-printed form.
*   **C: Na anvelope** - The envelope is used to *contain* the ballot, not to mark the choice.
*   **D: Na mashine kati ya esika ya kovoter** - While a machine is present, the marking happens on the ballot.



"
Nini etindaki Allen kobanda bolukiluki ya mbula mwambe pona Musashi?,"The correct answer is **C: Kotiya bozui naye na bolukiluki na Mai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Allen akotisaki bozwi na ye mingi na misala ya masuwa pe abandaki kosala milende mpona kozwa Mushasi na komipesaka mingi na bitumba."" This translates to ""Allen took many arrows with him in the battles and often practiced shooting at Musashi and hitting many targets.""  This directly indicates he *shot arrows* (kotisa bozwi) *with* (naye) in the *battles* (bolukiluki) *with Mai* (na Mai).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bizui naye:** The passage doesn't mention a direct fight/struggle (""bizui"") with Musashi.
* **B: Mposa naye na kolanda karte nase ya mai:** While he *was* with Mai when finding the card, that's not the reason he participated in the battles with Musashi.
* **D: Mposa naye na Etumba:**  Etumba isn't mentioned in the context of why Allen fought with Musashi.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, Allen atiyaki bozui naye ebele na eloko nini?","The correct answer is **A: Kozongisa Musashi**.

Here's why:

The passage states Allen ""akotisaki bozwi na ye mingi na misala ya masuwa pe abandaki kosala milende mpona kozwa Mushasi."" This translates to ""he frequently took the voice with him in the guise of a mask and they began to work together to defeat Musashi.""  This clearly indicates Allen is working *with* a voice (presumably Musashi's) to defeat Musashi.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bolukiluki na mai:** While the passage mentions investigation with oil, it doesn't say Allen is preoccupied with this.
* **C: Kotonga ROV moko:** The passage mentions a ROV being used in investigation, but doesn't link Allen to controlling it.
* **D: Koyekola mae matali kolanda karte nase ya mai:** This refers to inspecting the oil card, which is a detail of the investigation, not Allen's main activity.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini ekokaki kotinda aksida elekana na kati mpe nzinganzinga ya mokili?","The correct answer is **B: Radioactif Cesium**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""bamonaki césium na iode ya radioactifs na izine"" (they found radioactive cesium and iodine in the dust).  The question asks what could be causing the accident and the resulting contamination. Radioactive cesium is directly identified as a contaminant found *because* of the accident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Essence ya Iranium (Uranium essence):** While the passage mentions uranium containers were present, it doesn't state uranium *caused* the initial accident. It suggests the containers existed beforehand.
* **C: Mulinga ya pete (Dust):** Dust is the *result* of the accident, not the cause.
* **D: Iodine:** While iodine is mentioned as being found, cesium is highlighted as a significant radioactive contaminant, making it a more direct answer to the question of what's causing the problem.



"
Na mae malandi nini ezali te moko ya batoli oyo bapesaki bafandi ya esika kolanda aksida na uzine?,"The correct answer is **D: Kotika komela mai ya robine** (Not closing the water tap).

Here's why:

The text states the officials advised people *not* to use the water from the taps (""na komela te mai ya robinet""). This is a direct instruction related to the accident at the plant, as the radioactive cesium and iodine were found in the water.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kotika kosalela baventilateur** (Using a fan) - The text mentions fans, but doesn't say *not* to use them, only that they were being used.
*   **B: Kotikala na kati ya ndako** (Staying inside houses) - The text mentions people were advised to stay inside, but doesn't present it as a mistake.
*   **C: Koboya kokotisa milinga ya pembe na zolo** (Not properly securing the plant's perimeter) - The text doesn't mention anything about perimeter security.



"
Kolanda maloba ya Dr. eloko ya motuya pona Moll XDR-TB ezali?,"The correct answer is **C: Talo ya bato oyo bakoki kozua virisi kouta na moto moko oyo azali na yango** (The rate at which people can catch the virus from one person who has it).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""nsima ya mbula moko, moto oyo aza na maladi akoki kopesa maladi na bato 10 to 15 oyo bazalaki pembeni na ye."" (Within a month, a person with the disease can infect 10 to 15 people nearby). This directly refers to the rate of transmission.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Virisi oyo ezali kozuama na lopitalo** (The virus that is spreading in the hospital) - While the passage mentions people getting sick in the hospital, Dr. Moll's concern isn't *where* it's spreading, but *how easily* it's spreading.
* **B: Virisi ezali kotia tembe na bakisi** (The virus is contained in the sputum) - The passage doesn't focus on how the virus is carried, but on its infectiousness.
* **D: Ezali na talo ya liwa likolo** (It is a rate of mortality) - The passage discusses infection rates, not death rates.



"
Babeli boni kati ya bae bazuaki virisi bamonani kozala basali na lopitalo?,"The correct answer is **C: 15**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""nsima ya mbula moko, moto oyo aza na maladi akoki kopesa maladi na bato 10 to 15 oyo bazalaki pembeni na ye.""  This translates to ""within a month, the person with the disease could infect 10 to 15 people who were nearby.""

Therefore, the answer is 15, representing the *maximum* number of people a single infected person could infect.



"
Lolenge nini ya Teknolozie NextGen ezali kosalela?,"The correct answer is **A: Satellite-based technology**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that NextGen *uses satellite technology* (""Esalelaka mayele ya satelite..."") and contrasts it with older radar-based systems (""...na mayele ya kala oyo esimbamaki na radare..."").  The whole point is a shift *to* satellite technology.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Precision technology:** While NextGen aims for more precision, this is a *result* of the technology, not the technology itself.
* **C: Ground-radar-based technology:** The passage specifically says NextGen is *replacing* this older technology.
* **D: Carbon emissions technology:**  The passage mentions reducing fuel consumption (and thus potentially emissions) as a *benefit* of NextGen, but the technology itself isn't about emissions.



"
Lolenge nini NextGen ezali kosalisa ba Pilotes?,"The correct answer is **A: Kopumbwa na banzela ya mukuse** (Reduced congestion).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""NextGen...elobi ete ekosalisa bampepo na kokende na banzela ya mikuse mingi...""  This translates to ""...claims to reduce air traffic congestion..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kopesa mpepo bansango ya solosolo** (Provide individual wind information) - The passage doesn't mention specific wind information.
* **C: Kokitisa bobebisi ya mapata na milinga** (Improve accuracy of maps and routes) - While NextGen *uses* more accurate tracking, the passage doesn't say it *improves* the maps themselves.
* **D: Essence mukie** (Cheap fuel) - The passage mentions saving fuel, but doesn't claim NextGen *makes* the fuel cheaper. It saves fuel by optimizing routes.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, bato ya Istware baseki FBI te pona kotiya bokebi mingi na makambo nini?","The correct answer is **A: Kotambwisa bolongi ya lisanga na bango** (Exploiting their investigative authority).

Here's why:

The text states the FBI is accused of using its powers (investigative authority) to blackmail individuals, specifically regarding ""likanisi ya kotombola bolongi ya lisanga na bango"" – which translates to exploiting their investigative authority/powers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kotiya mbongo ebele na makambo ya pete pona kobongisa** (Taking money for things done to facilitate investigations) - While the text mentions Congress allocated funds, it doesn't accuse the FBI of *taking* money for investigations themselves.
* **C: Kotiya bokebi mingi na makambo ya Pornografi** (Taking a lot of interest in pornography cases) - The text mentions the FBI was authorized to investigate 10 employees for pornography, but it’s not the main reason they're being criticized.
* **D: Makambo ya koyiba mituka** (Things related to stealing underwear) - This is a specific detail (mingimingi mituka bayibi - underwear thefts) but not the overarching reason for the accusations.  It's *evidence* of the abuse of power, not the abuse itself.



"
Makambo ya bosoto na mobu ya mosala ezali kotinda FBI kosala nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Kotiya basali na makmbo ya pornografi** (To hire personnel for pornography cases).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Congres ebandi kopesa mosolo na makambo ya bosoto na mobu ya mosala 2005 pe elobaki ete FBI kotinda basali 10 po basala pornografi ya mikolo.""  This translates to ""Congress allocated funds for overtime in the 2005 budget and decided that the FBI should hire 10 personnel to work on child pornography.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kotiya mbongo ebele na makmbo ya koyiba mituka** (To spend money on cases of child abuse) - While child abuse is related, the text specifies the *hiring* of personnel for pornography cases, not just spending money on them.
*   **B: Komatisa talo ya bolongi ya Lisanga** (To investigate the bombing of the World Trade Center) - This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Kotiya bokebi mingi na bambeba oyo ezali pete nakobongisa** (To gather more evidence on those involved in the bombing) - This is also not mentioned in the text.



"
Nini esalemaki na mutuka ya koboma moto oyo eyaki kosunga na aksida ya JAS 39C Gripen? ,"The correct answer is **A: Esalaki aksida** (There was an accident).

Here's why:

The text states ""motuka moko ya aeroport oyo ebomaki moko ebalukaki ntango ezalaki kosalisa"" which translates to ""one of the airport's vehicles crashed while it was operating"". This directly indicates an accident occurred.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ekweyaki** (It took off) - The Gripen *landed*, not took off.
*   **C: Epasukaki** (It broke down) - The text doesn't mention any mechanical failure of the airport vehicle.
*   **D: Essence esilaki** (It ran out of fuel) - Again, the text doesn't mention fuel as a factor.



"
"Kolanda aksida ya JAS 39C Gripen, Aeropor ekangamaki kopekisa nini?","The correct answer is **A: Mibembo ya mombongo** (Damaged engines).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...esalaki ete bampepo ya mombongo ekwea te na aéroport wana."" This translates to ""...it was stated that the plane's engines wouldn't start at that airport.""  This directly implies engine trouble was the issue preventing takeoff.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mituka mitano** (Five planes) - The text doesn't mention anything about other planes.
* **C: Ba Television ya Esika** (Local Television) - The text doesn't mention media coverage.
* **D: Squadron Leaders** (Squadron Leaders) - While a squadron leader is mentioned, the issue isn't *about* them, it's about the plane's mechanical problem.



"
Na tango ya Botomboki ya Iran Brzezinski andimaki kopesa batoli na nani?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

The text states: ""Po aza NSA, asalisaki Carter na kolandela makambo ya politiki ya mokili, na ndakisa boyokani ya Camp David, na 1978; kobongisa boyokani kati na Amerika pe Chine na suka ya mibu 1970; kotomboka ya bato ya Iran, oyo esalaki ete bakanga bato na Iran na 1979..."" 

This means Brzezinski advised Carter on the Iranian revolution.  Therefore, he was informing *Carter* about the situation.



"
Nani azalaki kosala mosala lokola mopesi-toli mpona libateli ya mokili mobimba (NSA) tii na mbula 1977?,"The correct answer is **B: Kissinger**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Po aza NSA, asalisaki Carter na kolandela makambo ya politiki ya mokili, na ndakisa boyokani ya Camp David, na 1978; kobongisa boyokani kati na Amerika pe Chine na suka ya mibu 1970; kotomboka ya bato ya Iran, oyo esalaki ete bakanga bato na Iran na 1979; pe ndenge Union Sovietique ekotaki na Afghanistan na 1979.""  This means Brzezinski *replaced* Kissinger as National Security Advisor.

The passage also specifically says ""azwaki esika ya Henry Kissinger."" meaning Kissinger held the position before Brzezinski.



"
Na mae malandi nini emonisi te mpenza mosala ya Bobek na Partizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **B: Atiaki mingete ebele koleka ba jouers nyonso**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Moto mosusu te asi abeta bamatch ebele to atia mingete mingi mpona ekipe wana koleka Bobek."" This translates to ""No one else played as many matches or scored as many goals for that team as Bobek.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tango azalaki kobeta na ekipe Atiaki mingete koleka 468** - While true, this is *a* fact about his time at Partizan, not what *distinguishes* him.
* **C: Na mbala moko aponamaki kozala joueur ya malamu na istwre ya ekipe** -  The text says he was declared the best player *in the history* of Partizan in 1995, but this is a consequence of his performance, not the defining characteristic.
* **D: Abetaki masano ebele koleka ba joueurs nyonso** - The text doesn't mention anything about salaries.



"
Maloba nini na mae matali istware ya Bobek na Partizan ezali ya solo?,"The correct answer is **D: Azuaki lokumu pe koyebana mingi sima ya koponama joueur malamu ya Partizan.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Na 1995, baponaki ye mosani ya ndembo aleki nyonso na lisolo ya Partizan."" This translates to ""In 1995, they named him the best player in the history of Partizan."" This clearly indicates he was recognized as a legendary figure *after* his playing career was over.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Abandaki kobeta pona Partizan na mbula 1945** - While true, this only states when he *started* playing for Partizan, not what makes his history special.
* **B: Abetaki pona Zagreb yambo ya Partizan Belgrade** - The text states he came *from* Zagreb *to* Partizan, not the other way around.
* **C: Abetaki pona Partian tii na mbula 1995** - He finished playing in 1958, not 1995. 1995 is the year he received the honor of being named the best player.



"
"Koland maloba wana, ezaleli nini ekesenisi Hesperonychus na Velociraptor","The correct answer is **B: Azali na linzaka ya mibale munene** (It has large claws on its feet).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Linzaka na ye ya mibale eza monene koleka, yango ebimisaki nkombo ya Hesperonychus oyo elimboli """"linzaka ya weste."""" "" which translates to ""Its feet have large claws, which gave Hesperonychus the name 'western claw'.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ezali na makolo mibale** (It has feet) - Both Hesperonychus and Velociraptor have feet, so this doesn't *differentiate* them.
* **C: Azali na masala mingi** (It has many teeth) - The passage mentions this as a shared characteristic, not a difference.
* **D: Makila naye ya moto** (It has strong arms) - The passage mentions this as a shared characteristic, not a difference.



"
Ntina ya kombo “Hesperonychus” ebimi na ezaleli nini ya bikelamu ya physique ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba manzaka** (Claws).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ndeke oyo eza na masala mingi pe **makila ya moto**, bato bazalaki kokanisa ezalaki kotambola ya kotelema na makolo mibale na manzaka lokola Velociraptor."" (This dinosaur had many claws and **sharp nails**, people suspected it used its feet and claws to hunt like Velociraptor.)

Later it says: ""Linzaka na ye ya mibale eza monene koleka, yango ebimisaki nkombo ya Hesperonychus oyo elimboli """"linzaka ya weste."""" (Its foot claws were particularly large, which is why the name Hesperonychus means """"western claw."""")

Therefore, the name ""Hesperonychus"" directly relates to the dinosaur's prominent claws.



"
Na maloba malandi liloba nini na mae matli kobomana na masasi ezali yasolo?,"The correct answer is **D: Kobomana na masasi esalemaki na Buffalo**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about what happened *at* the shooting.** The passage states: ""Mobali ya mibu 30, oyo abotamaki na Buffalo, azalaki kati na bato minei oyo babomaki na masasi, kasi mwasi na ye azokaki te."" (The 30-year-old man who arrived in Buffalo was among those who were shot, but his wife did not go with him.)
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A:** While they lived in Texas, the question focuses on the event in Buffalo.
    * **B:** The passage doesn't mention how many people were in the group.
    * **C:** This is a fact stated in the passage, but doesn't answer the question about the shooting.

Therefore, the most direct answer to the question is that a shooting occurred in Buffalo.



"
Maloba nini ezali yasolo pona mae matali likama esika oyo kobomana na masasi esalemaki?,"The correct answer is **A: Esalemaki na feti ya Aniversaire na Buffalo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Babalani babalanaki na Texas mbula moko eleki pe bayaki na Buffalo mpona kosepela na baninga mpe bandeko."" (The parents lived in Texas a year ago and moved to Buffalo to celebrate with family and friends.)
* **The question asks:** What event is the shooting related to?
* **The passage then mentions:** A shooting happened involving people at the anniversary celebration in Buffalo.

Therefore, the shooting occurred *during* the anniversary celebration *in Buffalo*.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, mikonzi bazalaki na motungisi nini pona mae matali Luno?","The correct answer is **A: Kozanga masuwa ya biloko** (Building landing zones for materials).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Masuwa ya 100 metele ezalaki na nzela mpona kokende kozwa biloko na yango mpe na ebandeli bakonzi bazalaki kobanga ete masuwa ekokweyisa biloko ememi.""  This directly translates to ""Landing zones of 100 meters were on the main road to receive materials there and initially the engineers thought the landing zone could accommodate more materials.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mipepe mpe mbonge makasi** (Sheets and strong ropes) - These are mentioned as being used to lift the Luno, but aren't what the engineers were *planning* or *focused* on.
* **C: Koyiba essence** (Refueling) - The text mentions fuel volume, but doesn't say engineers were focused on refueling.
* **D: Makoki ya baekipage kozoka** (The crew's ability to leave) - This isn't mentioned at all in the text.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae matali Luno liloba nini ezali yasolo te?","The correct answer is **A: Pane ezuamaki liboso yakozua masuwa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Masuwa ya 100 metele ezalaki na nzela mpona kokende kozwa biloko na yango mpe na ebandeli bakonzi bazalaki kobanga ete masuwa ekokweyisa biloko ememi."" (A 100-meter raft was on the main road to try and save things from it, and initially the workers thought the raft could carry a lot of things.)

This directly indicates a previous attempt to use a raft (masuwa) for rescue efforts. The passage focuses on *why* the raft wasn't successful, implying it was tried before Luno's situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Masuwa ezalaki na 100 litres ya essence na kati na tango ya panne** - The passage talks about 120-160 cubic meters of fuel for Luno, not 100 liters in a raft.
* **C: Kati ya baekipage zomi na mibale, moko azokaki** - This refers to the helicopter crew, not the raft.
* **D: Masuwa etindikamaki kokweya na mai** - This doesn't align with the passage; the raft wasn't sinking.



"
Na mibu nini Algerie ezuaki Lipanda?,"The correct answer is **C: Na mibu 1960**.

The text states: ""Na mibu 1960 azongaka na Algerie oyo eutaka kozwa lipanda mpona koteya lolenge ya kokamba filme."" (In the 1960s he went to Algeria which was starting to win its independence in order to learn how to make films.)



"
Na esika nini BaTelevision etiyamaki te na ngonga ya matanga?,"The correct answer is **D: Na esika ya Saint-Pierre**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...likoki ezalaki te mpo bato nyonso bakota na matanga na esika ya Saint-Pierre.""  This directly translates to ""...it wasn't possible for everyone to fit in the cemeteries in Saint-Pierre.""  This means television broadcasts were *not* able to accommodate everyone wanting to attend the funerals at Saint-Pierre.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bisika nyonso na Roma:** The text says broadcasts *were* happening in various churches throughout Rome.
*   **B: Na bamboka ebele ya Italy:**  While broadcasts happened in other parts of Italy, the text doesn't state they *didn't* happen there. It just highlights Saint-Pierre as a problem area.
*   **C: Na bisika moko moko ya Pologne:** The text mentions Poland having similar viewings, but doesn't say television wasn't present there.



"
Molulu ya Matanga esalemaki wapi?,"The correct answer is **A: Na Bisika ebele na Roma** (On large screens in Rome).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Ba ecran ya batelevizio ebele ya minene, batiaki yango na bisika ndenge na ndenge na Roma mpona kosalisa bato na kotala molulu wana."" This directly translates to ""Large television screens were set up in various squares in Rome to allow people to follow the funeral.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Na Pologne (In Poland):** The text mentions gatherings in Poland, but doesn't say the funeral *took place* there.
* **C: Na esika ya Saint-Pierre (At Saint Peter's):** The text states people *wanted* to be at Saint Peter's, but couldn't all fit.  The viewing happened in squares around Rome.
* **D: Yambo na Roma, sima na engumba mosusu ya Italy (First in Rome, then in other cities of Italy):**  While there were viewings in other parts of Italy, the initial and primary viewing location described is in the squares of Rome.



"
"Kolanda kopanzana, banani bazuaki bakisi pona kozoka ya makasi?","The correct answer is **A: Pene ya bato mitano** (Five people).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ntango mokonzi akomaki, ndako epanzanaki. Moto te azokaki, kasi bato pene ya mitano oyo bazalaki na ntango ya likama wana bapesaki bango kisi mpo bamiyokaki mabe mpenza.""  This translates to: ""When the manager left, the door closed. No one entered, but five people who were already there were given keys to lock it up well.""

Therefore, five people were given keys for security.



"
Nani apesaki nsango ya essence kotanga?,"The correct answer is **C: Mokonzi moko ya komapani ya essence**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mokonzi moko ya kompani ya essence ayaki na esika wana ntango moto moko ya pene abengaki mpona koyebisa ete essence ezosopana.""  This translates to ""A manager of the essence company was at the scene when a person from the building reported that the essences were stolen.""

This clearly indicates the manager of the essence company reported the theft. The other options are incorrect based on the text:

* **A & B:** The text specifically states someone *from* the apartment reported it, not someone *in* the apartment.
* **D:** There's no mention of a manager *of the apartment* in the text.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, bato boni bakufaki na likama?","The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The text explicitly states two people died: one person's life was lost (""liso moko ekufa"") and one person is missing (""eteni moko ya boongo eza te"").  

Therefore, the answer is 2.



"
Monduki ya nani eboyaki kosala na ngonga moko tango ya laksida?,"The correct answer is **C: Schneider**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Schneider aza na mpasi oyo ezosila te, liso moko ekufa, eteni moko ya boongo eza te mpe batonga elongi na ye na titane."" This translates to ""Schneider had an incident that wouldn't end, one eye was lost, a body part was missing and they tortured him with titanium.""  This clearly indicates Schneider was the victim of an attack/incident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cuddeback** - Cuddeback is described as a suspect (""mokumbi"").
*   **B: Uka** - Uka is mentioned as the place where the incident didn't happen (""Mandako ya Uka elongaki te"").
*   **D: Alden** - Alden is just listed as someone present (""bato bakufaki eza, Nicholas Alden"").



"
Masano nini na kati ya mae malandi etiyamaki libanda ya Pmasano ya Olympic?,"The correct answer is **B: Rugby**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Baponaki bugby, mingimingi lisanga ya Rugby, pe golfe na kati ya masano mitano oyo bazalaki kotalela soki bakosangana na masano ya Olympique."" This translates to ""They presented rugby, especially Rugby Sevens, and golf among the five sports they were considering to join the Olympic Games.""

While squash, karate, baseball, and softball are *also* mentioned as sports hoping to be included, rugby is the one specifically listed as being considered *along with* golf for immediate inclusion.
"
Masano nini kati ya mae malandi oyo komite Olympic esalaki maponami pona kobakisa yango kati ya masano?,"The correct answer is **C: Rugby union**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Baponaki bugby, mingimingi lisanga ya Rugby..."" (They presented rugby, specifically Rugby Union...).  It lists rugby along with golf as being considered for inclusion in the Olympics.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rollersports** - Not mentioned in the text.
*   **B: Baseball** - Mentioned as *previously* included in the Olympics (in 2005), but not currently under consideration.
*   **D: Softball** -  Also mentioned as *previously* included in the Olympics (in 2005), but not currently under consideration.



"
Arthur Guinnes asalaki contrat na St James Gate Brewery pona mibu boni?,"The correct answer is **D: 9000**.

The text states: ""Arthur Guinness asalaki contrat ya **mibu 9 000** na lisanga St James 'Gate na Dublin..."" (Arthur Guinness signed a contract for **9,000 pounds** at St James' Gate in Dublin...).

The question asks how many pounds the contract was for. Therefore, 9000 is the correct answer.



"
Pene ya ba Dollar billion boni Oyo Guinnes ekotisaka mbula na mbula?,"The correct answer is **D: 10**.

The text states that Guinness now generates revenue of **10 billion euros** (equivalent to 14.7 billion dollars) *annually*. The question asks for the number of *billion* dollars Guinness makes yearly.
"
Na bamboka boni Union Eropeyene esi ekuti virisi H5N1?,"The correct answer is **B: Motoba**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""France eza ekolo ya nsambo na Union Européenne oyo virisi ekoteli bango makasi;"" which translates to ""France is a key country in the European Union which *highly* contributes to their protection.""  ""Motoba"" in Lingala means ""high"" or ""great"".
* **Mitano (five)** is a number and doesn't fit the context of contributing to protection.
* **Sambo (problem)** is the opposite of what the passage describes.
* **Mwambe (strength)** is related, but ""motoba"" better conveys the *degree* of contribution.

Therefore, the passage indicates the EU relies *greatly* (motoba) on France for protection against H5N1.



"
Virisi H5N1 ezuamaki pona mbala ya suka na esika nini?,"The correct answer is **A: France**.

The text states: ""Grippe H5N1 ya bandeke eza mabe mingi mpona bato; bamoni ete ezwaki libata moko ya zamba oyo akufaki na mokolo ya yambo, marshland pene ya Lyon na este ya France."" (The H5N1 flu is causing many problems for people; it was detected in a wild bird on a farm near Lyon in eastern France.)

Therefore, the virus was first detected in **France**."
Mboka Haiti ekutanaki mbala ya suka na maladi tango nini yambo epanzana na basoda?,"The correct answer is **B: Tango mukie liboso ya basoda kokoma**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Haiti ezalaki naino na mikakatano ya maladi wana banda na mibu 1800"" which translates to ""Haiti was facing disease outbreaks of around 1800 *after* the arrival of the soldiers."" This directly links the disease outbreaks to the soldiers' arrival.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na bambula 1800:** While 1800 is mentioned as the number of deaths, it's *after* the soldiers arrived, not the starting point of the outbreak.
*   **C: Liboso ya mabele koningana:** The earthquake happened *before* the disease outbreak was linked to the soldiers.
*   **D: Na mbula 2009:** The text focuses on events following the 2010 earthquake and the arrival of the soldiers.



"
Bosoto ya esika nini epanzaki bokono?,"The correct answer is **A: Ebale ya Artibonite**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""...mikrobe ekota na ebale Artibonite, ebale moko monene na Haïti."" (…microbes spread from the Artibonite river, a large river in Haiti).  This directly identifies the Artibonite river as the source of the cholera outbreak.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kamp ya basoda ya ONU** – The camp *was* a location where the disease spread, but it wasn't the *source* of the outbreak. The text says the camp’s sanitation was poor, allowing the spread, but the microbes came *from* the Artibonite.
* **C: Esika mabele eninganaki na mbula 2010** – This refers to the earthquake-affected areas, but doesn’t specify the source of the cholera.
* **D: Biro ya Haiti pona Jutice pe Democracy** – This organization is not mentioned in the context of the cholera outbreak’s origin.



"
Boyangeli Ya Irlande ezali kolengela pona kosala nini ?,"The correct answer is **A: Kopesa etumbu na babuki mibeko pona bilangwiseli** (To give encouragement to those who break the rules for profit).

Here's why:

The passage states the Boyangeli is accused of ""kosala maponi ya parlema na lombango mpona kobongisa makambo"" (committing parliamentary fraud with the aim of enriching themselves) and enabling ""makambo ya kolongono ya nzoto mpe na makambo ya kosambisa mbeba minene ete babimisa nokinoki mobeko"" (illegal logging and facilitating large-scale poaching, allowing people to illegally profit).  He's also accused of enabling people to profit from illicit activities while others suffer.

This all points to him facilitating and benefiting from illegal activities, essentially encouraging those who break the rules to do so for profit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kobakisa mibeko ya makasi pona kopekisa milangwiseli** (To strengthen strict laws to combat illegal activities) - This is the *opposite* of what he's accused of.
* **C: Kolembisa mibeko pona milangwiseli** (To implement laws for illegal activities) - This doesn't fit the context. He's accused of *allowing* illegal activities, not creating laws *for* them.
* **D: Kosala milangwiseli ezala lisusu mbeba te** (To make illegal activities stop being poaching) - This implies stopping poaching, which isn't what the passage says.



"
Mibeko epesaki ndingisa pona ngonga mukie na mboka Irlande pona kosala nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Milangwiseli (Corruption)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the issue is about people taking bribes (""banda babandi kosalela mbongwana oyo eyokani te na mibeko"") and generally acting illegally (""makambo ya kolongono ya nzoto mpe na makambo ya kosambisa mbeba minene""). This describes **corruption**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kobuka ndako koyiba (To prevent theft):** While related to illegal activity, the passage details *the act* of taking bribes, not just preventing theft.
*   **B: Kokosa (To accuse):** The passage describes the problem, not the act of accusing someone.
*   **C: Kobunda (To stop/block):** The passage is about what *is happening*, not efforts to stop it.



"
Moto ya mobulu bazali kolandela ye pona nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Kokota na ndako ya bato** (To explode in a populated area).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...moto ya mobulu oyo bazalaka kolandela bazalaki kosala yango po **amikotisaki na ndako ya bato** te mpona mobulu makasi.""  This directly translates to ""...the bomb they were following was being made so it **wouldn't detonate in a populated area**...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kobuka (To break)** - While a bomb *could* break things, the primary concern mentioned is the location of the explosion.
* **C: Kobebisa biloko (To contain materials)** - The passage mentions chemical traces, but the main point isn't about containing materials.
* **D: Koyiba (To steal)** - There's no mention of theft in the passage.



"
"Na tango ya kobongola bilembo, moto ya mobulu azangaki kosala nini?","The correct answer is **B: Kopakola yango na elembo ya kimia**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...mbongwana esalemaki na nzela ya biloko ya moindo oyo bitiaki na bilembo ya kimia..."" which translates to ""...the bomber used a method of chemical symbols...""  This directly indicates the bomber was using chemical symbols to encode or disguise the bomb's instructions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kobongola moko ya makomi:** (To create a common mark) - The passage doesn't mention anything about creating a common mark.
*   **C: Kobuka yango:** (To break it) - While the bomb exploded, the passage focuses on *how* it was triggered, not simply broken.
*   **D: Kosalela biloko ya moindo pona kobongola yango:** (To use chemical substances to trigger it) - While chemicals were *involved*, the passage specifies they were used as *symbols* for encoding, not just for the explosive reaction itself.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana,na bambeba oyo elandi molakisi ya Anglais Karno afundamaki te pona mbeba nini?","The correct answer is **D: Kosalela maloba ya mabe na kelasi** (Telling bad stories in class).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Karno was known for ""kosalela maloba oyo baboti mosusu bazalaki komona eza mabe"" (telling stories others thought were bad) and that students said he was ""asalelaka maloba mabe na kelasi"" (telling bad stories in class).  This is the core reason cited for the issues with his teaching and the reason Modern Education wanted him to stop.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kosalela misala ya bato misuu** (Telling other people's examples) - While the passage mentions he was asked *to* tell examples, it wasn't the reason he was criticized.
* **B: Kolinga mwana ya kelasi** (Favoring a student) - There's no mention of favoritism in the passage.
* **C: Koniata bapiblisite kozanga kozwa ndingisa** (Allowing publishers to create textbooks) - This is about Modern Education's broader approach, not specifically *why* Karno was being addressed.



"
"Kolanada maloba wana, nani akangemaki Rolando Mendoza te?","The correct answer is **B: Ba Policiers** (Police officers).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Polisi moko ya Philippines akanga bato ya Hong Kong oyo bayaki kotala mboka..."" (Police officers from the Philippines kidnapped Hong Kong nationals who were tourists).  Rolando Mendoza was a police officer who took hostages. While others were involved (tourists, photographers), the *initial* act of kidnapping/taking hostages was done by the police.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, bakangemi nini nsango epesamaki te na ngonga koloba ete batiki bango?","The correct answer is **A: Bato ya kotala mboka** (Hong Kong tourists).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Polisi moko ya Philippines akanga bato ya Hong Kong oyo bayaki kotala mboka..."" (A Philippine police officer kidnapped Hong Kong tourists...). The question asks *who* was kidnapped, and the text directly identifies them as the Hong Kong tourists.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mibange** (Nationals/Citizens) - While some Filipinos were also involved (taking photos), they weren't the initial victims of the kidnapping.
* **C: Bato bakangaka babafoto** (People taking photos) - These people were *involved* in the situation, but weren't kidnapped.
* **D: Bana** (Children) - Children were *among* those kidnapped, but it's not the encompassing group that was initially targeted.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nani azali kozua ba signatire pona kopesa lisungi mpo libale ya basi na basi mpe mibali na mibali ezua ndingisa ya mibeko na mboka Brezil?","The correct answer is **A: Batomboki**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Batomboki bazolikia kozwa basiniatire milio 1,2 mpona kopesa yango na Congre ya mboka na sanza ya zomi na moko."" This translates to ""Supporters are collecting 1.2 million signatures to submit to Congress in the next month.""  They are the ones actively gathering signatures *to* support the law regarding inheritance and family rights.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Roberto Jefferson:** He *holds* the petition after it's collected, he doesn't collect the signatures.
* **C: Lingomba ya Katolika na Roma:** The Catholic Church is mentioned as being against the law, not collecting signatures to support it.
* **D: Marta Suplicy:** She is a former mayor involved in the issue, but not the ones gathering signatures.



"
Batomboki bakopesa ba signatire na bango epai ya nani?,"The correct answer is **C: Congrès National Ya Brezil**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Batomboki bazolikia kozwa basiniatire milio 1,2 mpona kopesa yango na **Congre ya mboka** na sanza ya zomi na moko."" (The supporters collected 1.2 million signatures to present to the **National Congress** in December of that year.)

Therefore, the signatures were given to the National Congress of Brazil.



"
"Kolanda maloba ya Armand Versace, nini esalamaki mbala moko yambo bato babanda kobulungana pona mopepe?","The correct answer is **A: Mabanga ebandaki kokweya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...na nsima mabanga ekweaki na likolo, bato babulungani, bagangi pe babandi kokima na bandambo nyonso."" This directly translates to ""...when the fields started to burn, people gathered, rushed and ran in all directions.""  The burning of the fields is explicitly stated as the trigger for people gathering.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Emoniseli ezalaki kosala na ngonga mitano ya retard:** This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **C: Mipepe ya makasi ezalaki:** While powerful motorcycles are mentioned, they aren't the *reason* people started gathering.
* **D: Ayebaki te sika moto moko ya libota naye azalaki:** This is about a personal feeling and doesn’t relate to the gathering of people.



"
"Kolanad maloba ya Versace, Mipepe ya makasi mingi ebadaki na ngonga nini?","The correct answer is **B: Sima ya mbula konoka** (The time of the rainy season passing).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...na nsima mbula ebandaki, kasi ezalaki makasi mpenza yango wana ezalaki neti ezobeta yo mbata na tonga..."" This directly translates to ""...during the rainy season, but it was a great misfortune then, it could easily drown you in the river...""  The passage links the intense flooding and danger to the passing of the rainy season.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngonga mukie sima ya emoniseli kobanda:** This refers to the beginning of the misfortunes/problems, not the peak time of the accidents.
* **C: Sima ya kobungisa ndeko naey ya mwasi:** This relates to a personal story of a loved one being kidnapped, a detail within the larger context but not the main focus of the accidents described.
* **D: Yambo ya mabanga:** This refers to the beginning of the fields being cultivated, also a detail within the broader description but not the core timeframe of the dangerous flooding.



"
"Yambo ya Fred,mipepe ya makasi mingi boni emonana na Est ya 35°W?","The correct answer is **A: Moko te** (None).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Fred eza kaka mopepe monene ya minei oyo ebeta naino te na este eza na 35°W."" This translates to ""Fred is the only significant ship seen not sailing east of 35°W.""

Therefore, no other large ships were observed to the east of 35°W.



"
"Na ngonga Fred emonanaki pene ya Ile ya Cape vert, ezalakaki kokende na ndambo nini?","The correct answer is **A: Weste**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Fred eza sikoyo na mipepe ya 105 miles na ngonga moko (165 km/h) pe ezokende na ndambo ya **nordi oeste**.""  ""Nordi oeste"" translates to ""northwest"". However, the question asks about the direction *relative to Cape Verde*, and the initial description states the island is 645 miles **west** of Cape Verde.  Since Fred is moving northwest *from* that point, he is generally heading in a westerly direction *towards* Cape Verde.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is Weste (West).



"
Kati ya bamodele elandi nini ezali na vitesi makasi koleka misusu ya kala?,"The correct answer is **A: Modele 802.11n**.

The text explicitly states: ""Vitese ya 802,11n mbala mingi eza makasi koleka ya oyo ya kala po ezalaki na vitese ya ebele koleka ya 600Mbit/s."" (The speed of 802.11n is often higher than previous ones, as it has a maximum speed of over 600Mbit/s). This directly answers the question."
Esengeli nini po modele 802.11n ekokana na sima na modele 802.11b?,"The correct answer is **A: Vitesi ya mbangu makasi** (Higher speed).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Vitese ya 802,11n mbala mingi eza makasi koleka ya oyo ya kala..."" (The speed of 802.11n is often higher than that of previous ones...)
* 802.11n was a significant upgrade in speed over 802.11b.  That's the primary reason it could operate effectively while being backwards compatible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Makoki ya modele 802.11b kosala na 5.0Ghz** (Ability of 802.11b to operate on 5.0Ghz) - 802.11b operates on 2.4Ghz, not 5.0Ghz.
* **C: Vitesi ebele koleka ya 600Mbit/s** (Speed higher than 600Mbit/s) - While 802.11n *can* reach up to 600Mbit/s, this isn't the reason it's compatible with 802.11b.  It's just its potential speed.
* **D: Baradio mibale** (Multiple radios) -  The passage mentions dual-band radios *can* be present, but it's not a requirement for 802.11n to be compatible with 802.11b.



"
Milulu boni esengelaki na moto oyo azua mbano ya Wolo na Olympic asengelaki kosana na masano ya Commonwealth?,"The correct answer is **B: Misato**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...asala nage ya etuluku ya **bato misato** balandki na masano ya Commonwealth..."" This translates to ""...swim the freestyle relay with **three swimmers** competing in the Commonwealth Games...""

Therefore, the question ""How many swimmers does the Olympic gold medalist need to compete with in the Commonwealth Games?"" is answered by ""Misato"" (three).



"
Pona nini moto oyo azuaki mbano ya wolo na Olympic azalaki komela kisi te pona pasi naye?,"The correct answer is **A: Azalaki na pasi te** (He didn't have the means/funds).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states ""emoni ete akozala te po azali komilela ete aza ya kobongama te"" which translates to ""it is known that he cannot because he is worried about not being able to afford it.""  This directly relates to not having the *pasi* (means/funds) to participate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ebelisaki ye** (They refused him) - The passage doesn't mention refusal, only financial concerns.
* **C: Azalaki kotungisama ete ekokaki kosala mabe na kolongono ya nzoto naye** (He was afraid it would negatively impact his health) - This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Bapekisa yango Na masano ya Common wealth** (He competed in the Commonwealth Games) - While he *qualified* for the Commonwealth Games, the passage focuses on why he can't participate in the Olympics.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini epesaki kozanga kososola makambo na mae matali koningana ya mabele?","The correct answer is **A: Komonana ya mapata ya moindo** (Analysis of seismic data).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mapata ya moindo oyo eza na boyokani te na volcan emonanaki na nse ya ngomba. Mapata ezalaki kopesa nzela te na koyeba soki volkan epasukaki mpenza to te."" (Seismic data near the volcano didn't show anything in the depths. The data wasn't giving a way to know if the volcano would erupt or not.)

This directly indicates that analyzing the seismic data is crucial for understanding and potentially predicting events related to the earthquake/volcanic activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Raport kouta Icelandic Meteorological Office** - While the passage mentions a lack of earthquake activity reported in Iceland, it doesn't suggest this report *helps* solve the problem of understanding the current event.
* **C: Karte mobimba ya Koningana ya mabele** -  The passage mentions a map, but it's about *existing* earthquakes, not a tool to understand the situation *currently*.
* **D: Makamabo oyo ezalaki koleka nabisika misusu ya Icelande** - The passage mentions Iceland but focuses on the US event, and doesn't say previous Icelandic earthquakes provide insight.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, Mbongwana na fase esalemaki na tango nini?","The correct answer is **C: Sanza ya misato mokolo ya 10**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Koningana ya mabele ya makasi oyo ebongwani esalamaki na mokolo ya 10 sanza ya misato na nordi este ya songe ya volcan caldera.""  This translates to: ""The strongest earthquake was recorded on the 10th of March in the northeast of the volcanic caldera.""

Therefore, the earthquake happened on March 10th.



"
Na mae matali sonde ya sanza ya Chandryaan-1 nini ezali yasolo te ?,"The correct answer is **D: Basonge ya sonde ezalaki na couleur**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""sonde ya moi ememaka mpe elili ya bendele ya Inde, oyo batya couleur na basonge nyonso."" (the probe also carried the flag of India, which was colored in all its glory). This directly indicates the probe had color.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Orbiteur oyo etindaki sonde ezalaki na baekipage** - The passage doesn't mention anything about a crewed probe.
* **B: Sonde ezalaki na bisaleli ya litomba mingi** - While it carried scientific instruments, the passage doesn't emphasize *many* instruments as its unique feature.
* **C: Bolongoli ya sonde ezalaki malamu** - The passage mentions its speed, but doesn't say that speed was its key characteristic.



"
Na mae malandi maloba nini elimboli malamu Sonde ya Lunar?,"The correct answer is **A: Ekitaki pene ya ndambu na nordi ya Sanza** (It crashed near the south pole of the Moon).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ekoki kokwea malamu pene ya ndambo ya sudi ya Sanza.""  This translates to ""...could crash near the south pole of the Moon.""  While it *could* crash, the passage later implies it *did* crash as it mentions the end of the mission.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kokita ya aksida ezalaki malamu** (There was an accident) - The passage doesn't mention an accident, just a potential crash.
* **C: Elongolamaki na manned Orbit** (Orbited in a manned Orbit) - Chandrayaan-1 was an *unmanned* mission, as indicated by it being a ""sonde"" (probe).
* **D: Ezalaki komema bisaleli mibale ya motuya mingi** (It collected data for many years) - The passage doesn't specify the duration of data collection, only that it collected significant scientific data.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, malengeli ya lolenge nini ekosalema ya suka pona kobatela na maladi?","The correct answer is **A: Kisi ya bangungi (Hygiene)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the disease spread due to poor hygiene (""bato na nzela ya bangungi"" - people in unsanitary conditions) and recommends improving hygiene (""kobongisa bibongiseli lokoka kotia mitambu ya bangulu na bisika oyo maladi eza mpenza mingi"" - improving hygiene in areas where the disease is prevalent).  While the other options are *mentioned* as related to preventing or dealing with the disease, they are *results* of needing better hygiene, not the core preventative measure itself.

* **B: Mitambu ya bangulu (Dirty surroundings)** - This is the *cause* of the problem, not the solution.
* **C: Mangwele ya Encephalitis (Encephalitis vaccines)** - These are a treatment/prevention for a *specific* consequence of the disease, but not the overall prevention of the disease spread.
* **D: Moustiquaire (Mosquito nets)** - These protect against mosquito-borne illnesses, which *may* be related, but the passage focuses on a disease spread through general unsanitary conditions.



"
Lolenge nini maladi ekomaka epai ya bato?,"The correct answer is **A: Bangungi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the illness is spread by ""bangungi"" (mosquitoes).** The text details how the illness started in the swamps, spread through mosquitoes, and mentions using mosquito nets (""moustiquaire"") to combat it.
* While ""Kisi ya bangungi"" (mosquito bite) is related, it's the *mosquito* itself that carries and transmits the disease.
* ""Bangulu"" (swamps) is where it *started*, not what *causes* the illness.
* ""Mitambu ya bangulu"" (swamp paths) is just a location mentioned in the spread, not the cause.

Therefore, **Bangungi (mosquitoes)** is the most accurate answer to the question ""Lolenge nini maladi ekomaka epai ya bato?"" (What causes the illness to spread to people?).



"
Kozanga ya phrase ya liboso ekoki kopesa nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Boyokani ya civile pona libala ya basi na basi mpe mibali na mibali**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kozanga kolonga ya etumbu ya mibale, oyo ezosenga bapekisa libala ya mibali na mibali to basi na basi, ekoki kobimisa boyokani ya civile na mikolo ezali koya.""  This directly translates to: ""The proposal for the age amendment, which would require a vote by individual or by proxy, could undermine civil stability in the coming days.""

Therefore, the phrase's proposal (kozanga) has the *potential to cause* civil unrest related to individual and proxy voting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Botali ya HJR-3 pona mbala mosusu:** While HJR-3 is mentioned later, the phrase itself isn't about restarting the vote on it.
* **C: Likita ya eleko ya mbalakata:** The text discusses an election, but the phrase’s impact is on stability, not the election's validity.
* **D: Kopekisa ya basi na basi mpe mibali na mibali:** This describes *how* the vote would be taken, not the *effect* of the phrase itself.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, Babomaki phrase ya mibale na ngonga nini?","The correct answer is **A: Na ngonga ya makita ya eleko**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mbongwana esalemaki na makita ya eleko oyo ntango mimonisi ya ministere babomaki phrase ya liboso...""  This directly translates to ""The bill was introduced in the elections, when the ministry commission proposed the phrase first...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Na mbula 2011** - While 2011 is mentioned, it's when the commission *started* working on it, not when they proposed the phrase.
* **C: Na mokolo ya yambo** - This refers to the first day, and isn't where the phrase was proposed.
* **D: Na mbula 2015** - This is when HJR-3 was revisited, long after the initial phrase proposal.



"
Nani abimisaki “Panama pappers”?,"The correct answer is **A: Biro ya bavoka “The Mossack Fonseca firm”**.

The text states: ""Mikanda ya Panama eza maloba oyo basalelaka mpona mikanda pene ya milio zomi ya biro ya ba avoka ya Panama ya Mossack Fonseca..."" (The Panama Papers are leaks of millions of documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca...).

Therefore, Mossack Fonseca is the firm that the papers originated from and were about.



"
"Koalanda maloba wana, zulunalu ya Grande Britagne bapataki nani lokola moto oyo azali kokamba kompani oyo ebombaka misolo?","The correct answer is **C: Deutsche Bank**.

The text states: ""Zulunalu The Guardian ya Grande Bretagne elobi ete Deutsche Bank ekamba pene ya moko na kati ya misato ya bakompani 1200..."" which translates to ""The Guardian newspaper of Great Britain reported that Deutsche Bank was involved in one of the companies of 1200...""

Therefore, according to the text, Deutsche Bank is the one accused of being involved with companies evading taxes.



"
Aksida ya Mpepo nini na mae malandi ebomaki bato ebele koleka?,"The correct answer is **A: Mpepo esalaki aksida na nzela kokende Armenie kouta Iran** (The plane crashed while traveling from Armenia to Iran).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sanza eleki Iran ekutanaki na likama koleka monene ya mopepe nsima ya mibu mingi ntango mpepo moko oyo ezalaki kokende na Armenie epanzanaki, ebomaki bato 168 oyo bazalaki na kati."" This directly translates to ""Recently, Iran experienced a major plane crash resulting in the death of many people when a plane traveling from Armenia crashed, killing 168 people on board.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Aksida ya helicopter ya bapolicier (Police helicopter crash):** While the passage mentions a police helicopter crash, it's a separate incident and doesn't involve the large number of fatalities.
* **C: mpepo esalaki aksidai na nzela kokende Iran kouta Armenie (The plane crashed while traveling from Iran to Armenia):** The passage clearly states the plane was *from* Armenia *to* Iran.
* **D: mpepo esalaki aksida na Mashhad (The plane crashed in Mashhad):** The passage mentions another crash *in* Mashhad, but this is a separate incident and doesn't represent the crash with the highest number of fatalities.



"
Na mae malandi nini ezali te kati ya bantina pona makama ebele ya bampepo na Iran ?,"The correct answer is **B: Kozanga mbongo pona kosomba bampepo ya sika**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Etumbu ya mikili mingi elimboli ete bakoki te kosombampepo ya sika."" This translates to ""Many reports indicate that they cannot afford to repair the helicopters.""  This directly points to a lack of funds (kozanga mbongo) being the obstacle to helicopter repair.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bampepo ya basivile mpe ya basoda oyo esala kala** - The passage *mentions* older helicopters, but doesn't say this is preventing current repairs. It's a background fact, not the current issue.
* **C: Mipekiselo oyo epekisi kosomba ba mpepo ya sika** - The passage doesn't mention any specific efforts to repair helicopters.
* **D: Lolenge mabe ya kobatela bampepo** - The passage doesn’t mention problems with connecting or operating helicopters, only with *repairing* them.



"
Na mae malandi nini ezalaki te na kati ya rapore ya etuluku oyo ezoyekola makambo ya Iraq?,"The correct answer is **B: Boyokani oyo ekoki komema mbongwana, Bitumba na Iraq ekoki kosalema lisusu te** (Conflict that could lead to war, and Iraq could be destroyed again).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ekebisi ete moto moko te akoki kondimisa ete likambo moko oyo ekosalema na Irak sikoyo ekosukisa bitumba ya bana-mboka..."" - This translates to ""It is believed that no one can rule out the possibility that something happening in Iraq could destroy the country again...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kolobela mabe mibeko oyo ezali** (Bad customs that existed) - While the report details bad things happening, it doesn't focus on *customs*.
* **C: Toli ya kobatela bandelo ya Iraq** (A desire to stabilize Iraq) - The passage mentions *addressing* Iraq's problems, not just a desire to stabilize it. It also emphasizes the political difficulties.
* **D: Libondeli pona koyokana na Amerike** (Preparation for confrontation with America) -  The passage mentions the US and relations with the Middle East, but not preparation for confrontation.



"
Nini na mae malandi oyo Etuluku ya koyekola makambo ya Iraq elobelaki te ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ekebisi pona kosilisa bitumba na Iraq epesama** (It states that preventing sectarian violence in Iraq is impossible).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""**Ekebisi ete moto moko te akoki kondimisa ete likambo moko oyo ekosalema na Irak sikoyo ekosukisa bitumba ya bana-mboka...**"" (It states that no one can guarantee that something happening in Iraq will not incite sectarian violence...).  This directly addresses the inability to prevent sectarian conflict.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kobongola lolenge ya kosala makambo na lombango:** While the report *contributes* to understanding the situation, it doesn't focus on controlling the narrative.
* **C: Kosalela masolo ya polepole:** The report aims for objective reporting, not advocating for specific actions.
* **D: Kotiya miango ya sika ya politiki:**  The report *mentions* political agreements, but doesn't aim to dictate them.  It references the *need* for them, not to create them.



"
"Kolanada maloba ya Police, nani azalaki moninga ya pemebeni makasi ya Provenzano?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Polisi elobi ete Lo Piccolo alongaki mpo azalaki moninga ya pembeni ya Provenzano na Palerme..."" which translates to ""Police say Lo Piccolo was intended to be Provenzano's right-hand man in Palermo...""

Therefore, Lo Piccolo is identified as the intended right-hand man (moninga ya pembeni) of Provenzano.



"
"Kolanda nsango epesami na maloba wana, nini etindaki Falcone na liwa?","The correct answer is **D: Moninga naye ya mafia Paolo Brosellino abomaki ye**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ebomisaki bato ya miyibi Giovanni Falcone na Paolo Borsellino na 1992."" This directly translates to ""...they killed the evil people Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992.""  The text links their deaths to the actions of those connected to Provenzano and Riina.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Babomaki ye na tango ya Etumba “the Riina-driven war”:** The text doesn't specify a date like ""Etumba"" or mention a ""Riina-driven war"" as the direct cause. It just states they were killed in 1992 as a result of actions by people connected to Riina.
*   **B: Police ebomaki ye:** The text states police are *investigating* the murders, not committing them.
*   **C: Bapesaki Lo Piccolo ndingisa ya koboma ye:**  Lo Piccolo is mentioned as someone who knew information, but not as directly responsible for Falcone's death.



"
Nini na mae malandi ezali te moko ya bolongi ya Hitoshi Saito ?,"The correct answer is **C: Molongi ya mitole mibale ya Wolo na Olympic** (Olympic gold medalist).

The text states: ""Moto ya Japon judoka Hitoshi Saito, oyo alongaki mitole mibale ya wolo na masano ya Olympique akufi na mibu 54."" This translates to ""Japanese judoka Hitoshi Saito, who won two Olympic gold medals, died at 54.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mbala mibale Molongi ya mokili** - This doesn't align with the information given.
* **B: Mokambi ya Federation ya Basani Judo nyonso ya Japon** - While he *was* president of the Japanese Judo Federation, this isn't what he was known *for* initially. The text highlights his athletic achievements first.
* **D: Boyebi makasi ya Judo** - This is too general. The text specifies *Olympic* gold medals.



"
Esika nini Iwasaki akimaki kolapa ndai?,"The correct answer is **B: Nepal**.

Here's why:

The text (P) states: ""akutani na mikakatano mbala mingi... akimaki libala na Népal..."" which translates to ""he experienced many difficulties... he built a school in Nepal..."" 

Therefore, Iwasaki built a school in Nepal.
"
Nani ambundisaki Iwasaki,"The correct answer is **C: Mbwa** (Dogs).

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""Bapirate bayibaki ye, **bambwa mabe babundisaki ye** na Tibet...""  This translates to ""Pirates followed him, **bad dogs chased him** in Tibet...""

Therefore, the passage explicitly states that dogs chased Iwasaki.



"
Alonso asilisaki course naye na ngonga nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Sima ya Schumacher kobebisa pneu naye ya liboso** (Because of Schumacher pushing him with his tires).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Michael Schumacher asalisaka kala mingi te na nsima ya Alonso, mpona makama mingi akutanaki na yango ntango azalaki kobunda na komema motuka na ye.""  This translates to ""Michael Schumacher didn't let up on Alonso, often making contact with him when trying to overtake."" This describes Schumacher aggressively pushing Alonso, often forcing him wide, and essentially using tire position to pressure him.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fisichella abungisaki makoki ya kokumba mutuka naye** (Fisichella gave him the opportunity to overtake) - The passage focuses on the interaction between Alonso and Schumacher, not Fisichella assisting Alonso.
* **C: Sima ya Schumacher kosilisa course naye moko** (Because Schumacher blocked his course once) - The passage describes repeated pressure, not just a single block.
* **D: Sima ya koleka liboso** (Because he wanted to finish first) - While likely a motive, the passage doesn't *explain* Alonso's finish as being *because* he wanted to win, but rather the difficulties he faced *while* finishing.



"
Nini etindaki Schumacher kosilisa course naye noki?,"The correct answer is **B: Aksida na Alonso**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Michael Schumacher often struggled to overtake Alonso, and many incidents happened when he tried to pass him. This suggests Alonso caused Schumacher problems and prevented him from completing the race successfully.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Abungisaki makoki ya kotambwisa mutuka naye:** The passage doesn't say Schumacher lacked driving skill.
*   **C: Pneu kobeba oyo esalemaki na Fisichella:** Fisichella's tire issue affected *him*, not Schumacher's ability to finish.
*   **D: Suspansion ya motuka kobeba:** The passage doesn't mention anything about Schumacher's car having suspension problems.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, ezali mosala ya nani kotia amande pona bakangemi?","The correct answer is **B: Zuzi Glynn**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""zuzi Glynn abimisaki ekateli moko ya kosukisa na ntango mokuse mpona kokanga lisanga po epesa te bonsomi na bato oyo bakangi bango banda koleka bangonga 24 banda bakangaki bango..."" This directly translates to ""Zuzi Glynn ordered an investigation into why the records weren't being updated for people being booked, even though they were being booked 24 hours prior.""  This indicates Zuzi Glynn is the one initiating the process to correct the issues with the booking records, and therefore responsible for issuing the mandate (amande).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mokonzi ya police oyo akangaka bato** (The police officer who books people) - While they *receive* the mandate, they don't *issue* it.
*   **C: Biro ya “The Central Booking facility** (The Central Booking facility) - The facility is where the problem *is*, not who is solving it.
*   **D: Commisaire ya Esambiselo** (Commissioner of Records) - The text doesn't mention a commissioner being involved.



"
"Kolanda etinda ya bopekisi pona ngonga mukuse oyo elobelami na maloba wana, Bakangemi basengeli kozala na nini mpo bakanga bango koleka bangonga 24?","The correct answer is **C: Ekateli to etinda kouta epai ya zuzi Glynn**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Zuzi Glynn initiated a process to investigate why people were being held beyond the 24-hour limit.  The goal was to *find out* why people were being held longer than allowed and potentially release them.  Therefore, an investigation or a process stemming from Zuzi Glynn's action is the relevant condition for releasing people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Amande (Fines):** While fines are *mentioned* as a consequence, they aren't the *reason* for release. They're what might happen *if* someone is illegally detained.
* **B: Bokutani na mokonzi ya Police oyo akangaka bato (Interview with the Police Officer arresting people):** This might be part of the investigation, but isn’t the primary condition for release.
* **D: Kosamba (Praying):** This is irrelevant to the legal process described.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo elekiKolandana na bokomi, ntina nini esalelamaki te mpo na kolimbola kozongela mbala ya mibale oyo elongolamaki?","The correct answer is **B: Bokeseni ya mibeko (Weakness of institutions)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Badiplomate balobaki ete bamoni mikakatano mingi na mibeko ya Afghanistan yango wana ntina ya toure ya mibale eza te."" (Diplomats say there are many weaknesses in Afghanistan's institutions, which is why a fair election is not possible.)
* **The passage links the inability to hold fair elections directly to the fragility of Afghanistan's institutions.**  Without strong institutions, a credible election cannot occur.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Makama ya bokengi (Political will):** While political will is important, the passage *focuses* on the *capacity* to hold an election, not the *desire*.
* **C: Kosalela mbongo koleka (Lack of funding):** The passage mentions concerns about finances (""kobimisa mbongo""), but frames it as a consequence of the situation, not the root cause.  Weak institutions are preventing proper management of funds.
* **D: Kozanga bososoli ya mibeko (Reforming institutions):** This is a *solution* to the problem, not the problem itself.



Therefore, the passage identifies the **weakness of institutions** as the key factor preventing a successful election in Afghanistan."
"Mpo na nini nsukansuka, batindami bamonaki ete kozongela mbala ya mibale ezalaki na ntina te?","The correct answer is **A: Elandaki mibeko te** (It didn't follow the rules/laws).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Badiplomate balobaki ete bamoni mikakatano mingi na mibeko ya Afghanistan yango wana ntina ya toure ya mibale eza te."" (Diplomats say they found many discrepancies in Afghanistan's laws, which is why the election was invalid.)
* This directly means the election didn't adhere to the established legal framework.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ezalaki na makama ya libateli** (There was a lack of participation) - The passage doesn't focus on voter turnout, but on *how* the election was conducted.
* **C: Kozanga bososoli ezalaki kati na mibeko** (Violence was within the laws) - This is illogical and not mentioned in the text.  Violence would *invalidate* an election, not be accepted within the rules.
* **D: Mampo nampo nami yango ezalaki ntalo mingi** (There were many complex issues) - While complexity might exist, the core problem stated is a failure to adhere to the laws.



"
Nani apesaka lisalisi ya kosamba mpo na FATA?,"The correct answer is **B: Batu ya politike** (Political Parties).

Here's why:

The text states the President of Pakistan formed a ""Political Committee"" specifically to look into FATA, and this committee was meant to *be an example of the UK's governance and to work to achieve the 247 goals of Pakistan*.  Therefore, the political parties (through this committee) are the ones tasked with the process of working towards the goals for FATA.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bokonzi ya Pakistan** (Government of Pakistan) - While the government is ultimately responsible, the *committee* composed of political parties is the specific entity mentioned as doing the work.
*   **C: Mokambi ya Pakistan** (President of Pakistan) - The President *formed* the committee, but didn't personally do the work.
*   **D: Mokambi ya Angleterre** (Government of England/Great Britain) - The text references the UK's governance as a *model*, but doesn't say the UK government itself is involved in the process.



"
"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali solo te?","The correct answer is **C: Bazali kolanda mibeko ya Pakistan.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bato wana nde bato basengeli kosala misala ya boyangeli pe ya kosambisa na kolanda mobeko 247 ya mboka Pakistan.""  This directly translates to: ""That group needs to give examples of allegiance and to support the enactment of 247 laws of the Pakistani state.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bazali kopesa misala ya bosembo (They are giving examples of loyalty):** While allegiance is *part* of what they're doing, the passage specifically mentions *enacting laws* as well.
* **B: Bampo nampo namanaki na mokambi ya Pakistan (They are interfering with the leadership of Pakistan):** The passage doesn't indicate any interference with leadership, only with the legislative process.
* **D: Bazali na bokonzi mobimba likoló na bisika mosusu (They have a large agenda with other interests):**  The passage focuses solely on their actions related to Pakistani laws.



"
Emma Stone azuaki libonza nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Mosani malamu koleka** (Best Actress).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gosling na Stone baponaka bango lokola basani ya filme ya malamu ya mobali mpe ya mwasi."" This translates to ""Gosling and Stone were nominated as best actor and best actress.""  Therefore, Emma Stone was nominated for Best Actress.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mosani malamu koleka oyo asungaka** (Best supporting actress) - The text doesn't specify *supporting* actress.
* **B: Mokambi malamu koleka** (Best Actor) -  Ryan Gosling was nominated for Best Actor, not Emma Stone.
* **D: Oyo abongisaki filme malamu koleka** (Best Director) - The text mentions the director but doesn't say Emma Stone was nominated for that.



"
Libonza nini filme empo namaki te?,"The correct answer is **A: Foto kitoko koleka** (Beautiful photography).

Here's why:

The passage specifically praises the film's *cinématographie* (photography/cinematography) as one of its strengths, alongside the actors' performances and other technical aspects. The other options aren't mentioned as being particularly strong in the description.

* **Bilembo ya kotala koleka** (Beautiful costumes) - Not mentioned.
* **Kosanganisa mongongo kitoko koleka** (Beautiful set design) - Not mentioned.
* **Nzembo ya ebandeli kitoko koleka** (Beautiful original song) - Not mentioned.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi etikalaki kosala nsima ya koningana ya mabele?","The correct answer is **A: Ba reacteur nyonso na izine ya Hokuriku's Shika**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hokuriku Electric Power Co. alobelaki likama moko te ya koningana ya mabele pe ba reacteur nimero 1 na 2 izine monene ya nikleyere ya Shika ekangamaki."" This directly translates to ""Hokuriku Electric Power Co. reported a problem with the earthquake and the reactors number 1 and 2 at the Shika nuclear power plant were stopped."" 

Therefore, the reactors at the Shika plant are where the shutdown occurred as a result of the earthquake.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Aeroport na Ishikawa** - The airport is mentioned as being closed, not where the shutdown happened.
*   **C: Misala ya voirie** - Road issues are mentioned as a consequence, not the location of the shutdown.
*   **D: Isine ya lotiliki na Niigata** - The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant is mentioned as *being checked* but no shutdown is reported there."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ebebaki mpo na koningana ya mabele?","The correct answer is **A: Ba reacteur mibale na izine ya Shika**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hokuriku Electric Power Co. alobelaki likama moko te ya koningana ya mabele pe ba reacteur nimero 1 na 2 izine monene ya nikleyere ya Shika ekangamaki.""  This translates to: ""Hokuriku Electric Power Co. reported a disruption in power supply and the Shika nuclear power plant's reactors number 1 and 2 were stopped.""

Therefore, the power disruption is directly related to the reactors at the Shika nuclear power plant.



"
"Nakotala na makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali na mokanda yango te?","The correct answer is **C: Kozala ya basoda na lobwaku** (The presence of soldiers on the border).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically discusses:** Israele wanting soldiers to be present *always* on the Jordan River border, and the PA wanting to limit that presence to five years. This is the central point of contention described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mikolo mizali koyia ya Jerusalem (The days are numbered for Jerusalem):**  While Jerusalem is mentioned as a holy city, the passage doesn't say its days are numbered.
* **B: Ntina ya etumba ya 1967 (The end of the 1967 war):** This is historical context mentioned, but not the main issue being discussed.
* **D: Koswana mpo na ndelo (To strive for peace):**  The passage describes a *disagreement* about security arrangements, not a striving for peace itself.



"
"Nakotala na makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi ezali moko ya makambo oyo Palestine esengaka te?","The correct answer is **D: Kozala ya basoda mpo na mbula mitano na lobwaku ya Jordan** (The presence of soldiers for five years in the Jordan Valley).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Israele ezosenga basoda bazala ntango nyonso na lobwaku mpona mibu zomi nsima ya kotya maboko na boyokani kasi PA andimi bolongola basoda wana nsima ya mibu mitano.""  This translates to: ""Israel wants soldiers to remain indefinitely in the valley after the ceasefire, but the PA only agrees to soldiers for five years.""

Therefore, the one thing Palestine *doesn't* want is the indefinite (or long-term) presence of Israeli soldiers in the Jordan Valley, but is willing to accept them for a limited time – five years.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:**  The passage discusses the borders based on the 1967 lines, not controlling those borders.
*   **B:** Palestine *does* want control over the soldiers in the Jordan Valley, but they don't want them there *permanently*.
*   **C:** The passage mentions Jerusalem's holy status, but doesn't say Palestine doesn't want discussions about its future.



"
Ma ayekolaki mibeko na ekolo nini?,"The correct answer is **A: United States of America**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ayekolaka na universite ya New York mpe na eteyelo ya Mibeko ya Harvard..."" which translates to ""...studied at New York University and Harvard School of Public Health..."" Both of these institutions are located in the United States of America.

While Ma *is* from Hong Kong and has connections to China, the question asks where they *studied*, and the text explicitly states they studied in the US.



"
"Nakotala na makomi oyo eleki, kotelema makasi mpo na ekolo nini esalisaki Ma alonga na mampo nampo nami?","The correct answer is **D: Chine**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ma alongaki na pete na ebongiseli oyo ezalaki kolendisa boyokani ya makasi na mboka Chine.""  This translates to ""Ma was involved in a scandal that was disrupting economic relations in China.""

This clearly indicates that Ma's actions and the scandal are connected to China. The other options are mentioned as places Ma *studied* or *wanted to go*, but the scandal itself is linked to China.



"
"Ndenge elobami na mokapo yango, Carolyn Wilson asalaki mpo na nani liboso alongwa na engumba?","The correct answer is **C: Oha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...na mbala mingi na kati ya mabota wana bayebaki ete Carolyn Wilson ya OHA ayibaki mbongo oyo babombaki pe akimaki mboka.""  This translates to ""...often within those groups they believe Carolyn Wilson of OHA is the money they are fighting for and protecting the community.""

This directly links Carolyn Wilson to OHA (presumably an organization) and suggests she's seen as a key figure *for* them.  The other options aren't directly connected to her role as described in the text.



"
"Lokola etikali masano minei na eleko, nani azali na esika ya minei ya lisano ya batambwisi mutuka?","The correct answer is **A: Hamlin**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ya misato, Hamlin aza na point ya retard tuku mibale, kasi bapoint mitano koleka Bowyer."" This translates to: ""Thirdly, Hamlin has points three places behind, but five points ahead of Bowyer."" This means Hamlin is in a better position (higher rank) than Bowyer.

The question asks who is in the best position among the options. Since Hamlin is ahead of Bowyer, and the other options (Kahne, Stewart) are further back in the standings, Hamlin is the correct answer.



"
"Kolanda momekano ya mbangu oyo tolobeli na eteni, Kahne azali na bapwe boni na lisano ya batambwisi mutuka?","The question asks how many points Kahne has in the standings. The text states: ""Kahne na Truex, Jr. baza na esika ya mitano pe ya motoba, baza na ba point 2 220 pe 2 207.""  This means Kahne has 2220 points.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: 2220**.
"
"Nakotala na makomi oyo eleki, mbala boni bato bamonaki mabanga oyo kokweya mpe na nsima emonanaki ete eutá na Mars?","The correct answer is **B: Mbala mitano**.

The text explicitly states: ""Bakanisaka ete eza **mbala ya mitano** na lisolo ya bato oyo bato bamona eloko oyo eutaka na mars..."" (It is estimated that there are **five times** in the history of people who have seen something that fell on Mars...).

Therefore, the answer is five times.



"
"Ndenge tolobeli yango na bokomi, nini ezali solo mpo na mabanga oyo bamonaki ete eutá na mars?","The correct answer is **D: Bazali 34 kati na bango** (There are 34 of them).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Na kati ya bameteoriste pene ya 24 000 eyebana oyo ekwea na Mabele, kaka pene ya 34 bamona ete euta na mars."" This directly translates to: ""Of the approximately 24,000 meteorites that have fallen on Earth, only about 34 are believed to have come from Mars.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bango nyonso bazwamaki na ntango ya mbula ya mabanga ya sanza ya nsambo** (They were all discovered during the December meteor shower) - The text says some were found *around* December, not all.
* **B: Ezali na bato 24 000 kati na bango** (There are 24,000 of them) -  The passage states 24,000 meteorites *fell* on Earth, but only 34 are thought to be from Mars.
* **C: Bazali na motuya ya dolare 11 000$ koleka wolo** (They are worth between $11,000 and $22,500) - This refers to the price of other meteorites, not the Martian ones specifically.



"
Schumacher azwaki pansiɔ ntango nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Nsima ya kokweya ya Felipe Massa** (After the injury of Felipe Massa).

Here's why:

The text states Schumacher returned to Formula 1 *because* Felipe Massa was injured in an accident and couldn't compete. This is the direct reason given for Schumacher's return.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nsima na elonga na ye ya nsambo na lisano** (After his own retirement from racing) - While true he was retired, the text focuses on Massa's accident as the *reason* for his return.
* **C: Nsima ya kozua esika ya Felipe Massa** (After taking Felipe Massa's place) - He took Massa's place *because* of the injury, but the injury itself is the trigger for his return.
* **D: Na nsuka ya eleko 2009** (At the end of the 2009 season) - This is when he was racing *as a result* of Massa's injury, not the reason he returned.



"
Massa azokaki ntango nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Liboso ya eleko 2009** (During the 2009 season).

Here's why:

The text states Massa ""akosanga te na masano na eleko 2009 nyonso oyo etikali"" - meaning he didn't race in *any* of the 2009 season due to his accident.  Therefore, he crashed *during* the 2009 season.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Na ntango ya Grand Prix moko** (At one Grand Prix) - Too specific. While the accident *happened* at a Grand Prix, it's about when he stopped racing.
* **B: Nsima ya kolonga lisano Formula 1** (When finishing a Formula 1 race) - This isn't mentioned in the text and isn't related to his accident.
* **C: Liboso ya kozwa pansiɔ ya Schumacher** (When Schumacher retired) -  Schumacher's retirement is mentioned, but it's not related to Massa's accident.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, lolenge nini ebongiseli yango ekozala na bopusi likoló na AOL?","The correct answer is **C: Motango ya basaleli ya AOL ekobunda na basaleli ya Yahoo mpe Microsoft**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Soki tosangisi motango ya bato basalelaka misala ya Yahoo! na ya Microsoft, ekozala pene na motango ya bakiliya ya AOL.""  This directly translates to ""If you combine the number of people using Yahoo! and Microsoft services, it would be close to the number of AOL customers.""  This means the customer base of AOL is *similar in size* to the combined user bases of Yahoo! and Microsoft.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Motango ya basaleli ya AOL ekomata mbala mosusu:** The passage doesn't talk about the AOL customer base *decreasing*.
* **B: AOL ekozala kopanyi moko kaka oyo ekokobisa nkita ya IM:** While AOL was known for IM, the passage discusses its overall customer base, not just its IM function.
* **D: AOL ekosalelama lisusu te na Etats-Unis:** The passage specifically mentions AOL's popularity *within* the United States (""na kati ya Etats-Unis"").



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kosila nsima ya ebongiseli ya sika?","The correct answer is **C: Bonsomi ya AOL ya kokolisa zando na lombango na yango moko** (AOL's strategy of offering instant messaging in a single package).

Here's why:

The passage states that AOL was successful *because* it bundled IM with its service and was heavily used in the US.  The subsequent mention of Yahoo and Microsoft suggests they didn't do this as effectively, leading to a potentially similar client base for AOL.  The success is directly tied to *how* AOL offered IM - the bundled approach.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bokoli ya internet oyo epalangani mingi na Etats-Unis** (The widespread internet access in the US) - While important context, this isn't *what* caused the success, it's the environment it happened in.
* **B: Kosalela zando ya IM** (Using instant messaging) -  Everyone was using IM, AOL's success came from *how* they delivered it.
* **D: Boyokani ya Yahoo na Microsoft** (The competition from Yahoo and Microsoft) - This is a later point in the passage, explaining a potential outcome, not the initial reason for AOL's success.



"
Bato boni oyo bakufaki na kobundisa wana bazalaki ba polisi te?,"The text states: ""...ebomaki bapolisi mibale pe ezokisaki bato mosusu koleka tuku mibale."" This translates to ""...killed several police officers and injured many others, including around 20 civilians.""

Therefore, the answer is **D: 20** because the text explicitly mentions around 20 civilians were injured.



"
Nani ayebisaki motu oyo balobi ete azali na likambo yango?,"The correct answer is **A: Polisi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Polisi elobi ete bazokanisa ete Daesh (ISIL) nde moto abimisaki bitumba wana."" which translates to ""Police say they are investigating whether Daesh (ISIL) is the person who carried out the attack."" 

Therefore, the police are the ones investigating *who* carried out the attack.



"
"Na ntina ya ndenge ya Florida lokola ekolo molongi-azuaka nionso, nini epesamaki na Mitt Romney?","The correct answer is **D: 46 % ya kompo na**.

Here's why:

The text states Mitt Romney ""alongaki lobi maponi ya president ya ba républicain na Floride na moponi 46 na kati ya mokama"" (won 46% of the vote in Florida). The question asks what happened to Mitt Romney *in* Florida.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 32 ya batindami ya ekolo** - This refers to Newt Gingrich's votes, not Romney's.
*   **B: Kompo nama ya Republican Party** - While Romney is a Republican, this isn't a specific result *from* Florida.
*   **C: Batindami ya ekolo** - Too general; we need the specific percentage.



"
"Na kotalela oyo eleki, Gingrich azalaki na pourcentage nini na maponami ya liboso?","The correct answer is **C: 50 pourcent**.

Here's why:

The text states Gingrich won 32 out of 64 counties in Florida.  32/64 = 0.5 = 50%.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nani balongolaki ye nkombo, na nsima ya baresulta ya caucus?","The correct answer is **C: Perry**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Perry alobaki ete """"akozonga na Texas mpona kotala baresultat ya caucus ya lelo na pokwa, mpona koyeba soki nzela eza liboso mpona ngai na likambo oyo"""", kasi na nsima alobaki ete atikali na likambo wana mpe komeka na mokolo ya 21 sanza ya yambo na maponi ya ebandeli ya Caroline ya Sudi.""

This translates to: ""Perry stated he would return to Texas to assess the results of today's caucus, to see if the path forward was still right for him in the race, but later stated he was withdrawing from the race and suspending his campaign on January 21st in early state of South Carolina.""

Therefore, Perry is the one who withdrew after the caucus results.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nani alobelaki mingi motu mosusu kolandana na résultat ya etuluku?","The correct answer is **D: Perry**.

Here's why:

* **Perry** explicitly stated he would ""go back to Texas"" depending on the caucus results, implying his future in the race hinged on how well he did. He also later announced his withdrawal on January 21st. This shows he was directly tying his actions to the results.
* **Gingrich** focused on criticizing Santorum and Romney, not directly referencing a change in *his* plans based on results.
* **Romney** is mentioned as being the target of attacks, but we don't see him making statements *about* reacting to the results.
* **Bachmann** is described as wanting to reassess her strategy, but Perry is the one who explicitly stated a concrete action (returning to Texas) contingent on the results.

Therefore, Perry is the candidate who most clearly linked his future actions to the outcome of the caucus.



"
Esika kaka moko oyo elakiseli yango ezalaki wapi liboso ya 2015?,"The correct answer is **A: Radio ya TogiNet**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Na ebandeli na yango, emission wana ezalaki kosalema kaka na site Internet ya radio wana ya kala **TogiNet Radio**..."" (In the beginning, this emission was only broadcast on the internet site of the radio station formerly known as **TogiNet Radio**...)

This clearly indicates that before 2015, the emission was exclusively on TogiNet Radio.



"
Radio ezali kotalisa masolo kozala na bibabulisi ya ndenge nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Eteyelo ya kala** (Old stories/Past shows).

Here's why:

The passage states the website features ""teyatre ya radio ya eteyelo ya kala"" which translates to ""radio theater of old stories/past shows."" This directly indicates the radio station is offering content from the past.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Molinga** - Doesn't relate to the content described.
*   **B: Moyibi** - Doesn't relate to the content described.
*   **D: Ya bana-mboka** - Doesn't relate to the content described.



"
Eloko nini David Headley asangisaki oyo na nsuka esalisaki kobundisa?,"The correct answer is **A: Nsango (Plans)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Koluka komona pe kozwa basango oyo David Headley asalaki, esalisaki na mosala ya mibali 10 oyo bazalaki na mandoki...""  This translates to ""Also investigate and know the plans that David Headley made, which were involved in the operation of the 10 people who were in the attack...""

Therefore, David Headley provided **plans** that were crucial to the attack.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bagrenade (Grenades)** - While grenades *were* used, the text doesn't say Headley *provided* them.
*   **C: Bato ya minduki (Boats)** - The text mentions boats arriving, but not that Headley supplied them.
*   **D: Minduki ya kosala ndenge moko (Boats to do something)** - Same reason as C.



"
Motindo nini ya komema babundisi basalelaki mpo na kokende na Mumbai?,"The correct answer is **C: Masuwa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...bato babomaki bato na Mumbai **bakomaki na nzela ya masuwa**..."" (boats arrived in Mumbai **by sea**...).  This clearly indicates the method used to approach Mumbai for the attacks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nzela ya engbunduka** (route of attack) - This describes *where* the attack happened, not *how* they arrived.
*   **B: mpepo** (wind) - Wind is irrelevant to their method of travel.
*   **D: mutuka** (plane) - The text doesn't mention planes.



"
Liloba nini ezali kolakisa malamu mbano ya lisano ya Nadal na Raonic na Brisbane Open oyo tolobeli na bokomi?,"The correct answer is **C: Nadal alongaki Raonic**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nadal azwaki ba point 88% na match wana, azwaki ba point 76 ntango ye nde azalaki kobandisa lisano."" This translates to ""Nadal won 88% of the points in that match, he won 76 points when he was about to end the game.""  This clearly indicates Nadal *won* against Raonic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Raonic alongaki Nadal:** The passage states Nadal won, not Raonic.
*   **B: Raonic azalaki na 88% ya bapwe:** The passage says Nadal had 88% of the points.
*   **D: Raonic azuaki 76 points:** The passage says Nadal won 76 points.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, esika ya Nadal na Raonic ezalaki nini nsima ya eteni ya yambo?","The correct answer is **D: Raonic alongaki Nadal**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kala mingi te balongaki ye na Raonic na Masano ya Brisbane."" This translates to ""He lost to Raonic in the Brisbane tournament.""  Therefore, Raonic *beat* (alongaki) Nadal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Raonic azalaki na 88% ya bapwe** - The passage says Nadal won 88% of the points, not Raonic.
*   **B: Nadal alongaki na 76 pwe** - The passage states Nadal *won* 76 points when he was serving.
*   **C: Motango ezalaki 7-2** - While the passage mentions a 7-2 score, it's regarding a different match (Soki tokokanisi Nadal na Canada), not the match against Raonic.



"
Nsango na lokota nini ezuami te na bobongisi misato ya sika ya Naked News?,"The correct answer is **B: Koréen**.

Here's why:

The text (P) states: ""...lisanga oyo ya mikili mingi ezobimisa baprograme na Espagnole, na Italien, **pe na lokota ya corée mpona television, internet pe batelefone ya maboko.**"" 

This translates to ""...the large audience will broadcast programs in Spanish, Italian, **and in Korean on television, internet and mobile phones.**""

Therefore, Korean is the language *not* mentioned as already having broadcasts, but *will* have broadcasts. The question asks which language is *not* currently being used for the broadcasts.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nsango ya sika ya Naked News ekozala te wapi?","The correct answer is **A: Batelefone ya maboko (Mobile phones)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states that Naked News broadcasts in several languages and on television, the internet, *and mobile phones*.  The question (Q) asks where Naked News *wouldn't* be found. Of the options provided, ""Bisika ya masano"" (radio stations) is the only one not mentioned as a platform for Naked News.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: internet:** The passage explicitly says Naked News is on the internet.
* **C: Bisika ya masano:** The passage does *not* mention radio.
* **D: Télévision:** The passage explicitly says Naked News is on television.



"
Bawelani boni basilisaki te Giant Slalom ?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""na mobimba bato ya ski 45 na kati ya 117 na Giant Slalom balongaki te na lisano wana.""  This translates to ""of the ski competitors, 45 out of 117 did not finish the Giant Slalom.""

Therefore, 45 skiers did not complete the Giant Slalom."
"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali komonisa na bosikisiki mbano ya makokima mbangu na masano?","The correct answer is **B: Batu 45 oyo basalaka ski basilisaki te kopota mbangu na bango na Giant Slalom**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks where the text shows difficulties/problems in competitions.** The text specifically states ""mpe na mobimba bato ya ski 45 na kati ya 117 na Giant Slalom balongaki te na lisano wana"" – meaning 45 skiers out of 117 didn't finish the Giant Slalom race. This clearly indicates a problem/difficulty for those skiers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The text says Carpanedo won *a* race in Hungary, but doesn't highlight this as a difficulty.
* **C:** The text doesn't compare the number of skiers in different types of slalom, or suggest one was harder than the other.
* **D:** Carpanedo *finished* in a good position in Slalom, not that she faced difficulties.



"
"Na kati ya makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi NBA ezwaki ekateli ya kopekisa?","The correct answer is **B: Mosani moko ya Utah Jazz**.

Here's why:

The passage states the NBA suspended the season *after* players on the Utah Jazz tested positive for COVID-19.  It wasn't the entire league that caused the suspension, but specifically the cases within the Utah Jazz team.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eleko ya basketi** - The season was suspended *because* of the risk to the league, not the league itself.
* **C: Mosani nionso oyo azuaki COVID-19** - The passage doesn't say it was all cases that caused the suspension, only those on the Jazz.
* **D: Ekipi ya basketi ya Utah Jazz** - While related, it was the *players* (mosani) on the team, not the team as an entity, who tested positive.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ememaki na mitungisi ya NBA mpo na virus?","The correct answer is **B: Basani mingi bazwaki bokono na lisano ya Utah Jazz** (Many players tested positive on the Utah Jazz team).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) specifically states:** ""NBA ezwaki ekateli nsima wana mosani ya Utah Jazz bakangaki ye na maladi ya COVID-19."" (The NBA suspended the season after players on the Utah Jazz tested positive for COVID-19.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Batu ya NBA bazwamaki na bokono** (NBA players tested positive) - While true, it's not the *specific* detail mentioned as the trigger for the suspension.
* **C: Mosani moko ya Utah Jazz asalaki malamu te nsima ya kozwama na bokono** (One Utah Jazz player did not feel well after testing positive) - This is not stated in the passage.
* **D: Mosani moko ya Utah Jazz azwamaki na bokono** (One Utah Jazz player tested positive) - The passage implies *multiple* players, not just one.



"
Nani akotisaki but ya kolonga masano mpo na Washington Capitals na lisano na Atlanta Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **A: Nicklas Backstrom**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...passe ya liboso ya ntina na pokwa wana oyo Ovechkin apesaki, ezalaki passe ememaki na mongete ya kolonga match oyo moto ya sika **Nicklas Backstrom** atiaki...""  This translates to: ""...the game-winning pass that Ovechkin scored was a memorable pass from **Nicklas Backstrom**...""

Therefore, Nicklas Backstrom assisted the game-winning goal for Washington.



"
Nani akotisaki but na ye ya 60 ya eleko na match ya Capitals na Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Ovechkin apesaki bapasse 2 mpe apesaki bapasse 2 ntango Washington elongaki Atlanta Thrashers 5-3...akomi mosani ya liboso oyo akotisi mingete 60 to koleka na eleko moko.""  This directly says Ovechkin scored 2 goals, bringing his total to 60 goals for the season.

The text mentions Jaromir Jagr and Mario Lemieux as having previously achieved this feat, but they *didn't* score the 60th goal *in this specific game*.



"
Ntango nini banque ya Northern Rock ezalaki na bosenga ya lisalisi ya gouvernement?,"The correct answer is **C: Nsima Virgin Group esombaki banque** (When Virgin Group bid for the bank).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Etuluku Virgin ya Sir Richard Branson azalaki na bosengi ya banke oyo baboyaki liboso banke ekoma ya mboka mobimba."" This directly translates to ""The Virgin Group of Sir Richard Branson was in the bidding for the bank the government nationalized.""  This indicates that the government involvement (bosenga ya lisalisi) happened *during* the Virgin Group's attempt to buy the bank.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nsima ya kozongisa banque kozala ya ekolo** (When the bank was nationalized) - This is a *result* of the situation, not the time the government got involved.
*   **B: Ntango banque ekabwanaki na bokambi ya biloko ya kopanyi** (When the bank split its assets) - This happened *after* the initial government intervention.
*   **D: Na ntango ya mpasi ya lifuti ya mbongo** (During the financial crisis) - While the financial crisis was the *context* of the situation, it doesn't pinpoint the specific time the government got involved with Northern Rock."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola na bosikisiki makambo oyo Virgin Group esalaki na banque ya Northern Rock?","The correct answer is **A: Virgin Group esombaki mpe oyo ekambaka biloko ya kopanyi ya Northern Rock** (Virgin Group bid and took over the good parts of Northern Rock).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Etuluku Virgin ya Sir Richard Branson azalaki na bosengi ya banke oyo baboyaki liboso banke ekoma ya mboka mobimba."" (The Virgin consortium of Sir Richard Branson had a bid for the bank which was initially a nationalized bank). It also states they only took the ""banke ya malamu"" (good bank) and not the assets. This means they *took over* part of the company.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Virgin Group esombaki banque nsima ezonga ya ekolo:** (Virgin Group bid for the bank after the crisis had passed) - This is wrong. They bid *during* the crisis, attempting to prevent full nationalization.
* **C: Virgin Group epesaki banque soutien ya urgence na tango ya crise ya hypothèque:** (Virgin Group gave the bank emergency support during the mortgage crisis) -  The text doesn't mention providing support, only a bid to *buy* it.
* **D: Kopesa ya liboso ya Virgin Group mpo na banque esalemaki nsima ya kozongisa yango na ekolo:** (Virgin Group's initial loan to the bank was intended to restore it to the economy) - The text doesn't mention any initial loan, just a bid for the whole bank or parts of it.



"
Ndenge elobami na bokomi ekolo nini ezali kotungisama na botiami maboko na boyokani ya klima ya Kyoto?,"The correct answer is **A: États Unis**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...oyo etali climat etika Etats-Unis yango moko; sikoyo bakozala mboka moko pamba na mokili moko oyo eboyi kondima boyokani wana.""  This translates to ""...the climate policy of the United States at the time; they were a country alone in refusing to ratify that agreement.""

Therefore, the passage is discussing the United States' refusal to join the Kyoto Protocol, making it the country being talked about in relation to the refusal.



"
Bokonzi ya kala ya Australie ekanisaki ete kondimama ya Kyoto ekosala nini mabe?,"The correct answer is **C: Koteka charbon**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Boyangeli ya kala ya ba conservateur eboyi kondima Kyoto, elobi ete ekobebisa nkita po yango esimbami mingimingi na koteka charbon...""  This translates to: ""Former conservative viewpoints which opposed Kyoto, stated it would harm the economy because it would limit coal production...""

Therefore, the reason the former Australian conservatives believed the Kyoto Protocol was bad was because of its impact on coal production.



"
Ebongeseli nini bazuaki bakangifoto mpo na yangompo nampo na?,"The correct answer is **B: Ebongeseli ya bobateli mpe bomengo ya parc** (Policy of park staff and operations).

Here's why:

The text states that the discussion between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association was about people with guns being allowed to shoot more frequently, and that NPWS director Mick O'Flynn mentioned training and qualifications were needed. This directly relates to how park staff handle operations involving firearms and safety within the park.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ebongeseli ya lisanga ya bakangifotoya masano ya Australie** (Australian hunting policy) - While the Sporting Shooters Association is related to hunting, the text focuses on park regulations, not national hunting policies.
* **C: Ebongeseli ya NPWS** (NPWS policy) - This is too broad. The text focuses on a *specific* aspect of NPWS policy – how they deal with firearms within parks.
* **D: Ebongeseli ya kobundisa banyama ya Sporting Shooters Association** (Sporting Shooters Association hunting policy) - The text is about *NPWS* regulations surrounding shooters, not the shooters' internal policies.



"
Liloba nini ezali komonisa na bosikisiki te momekano ya kopekisa banyama mabe?,"The correct answer is **A: Lokola ezalaki momekano ya liboso ya ebongeseli yango, batalelaki yango te.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Na boyokani moko kati ya NPWS na Sporting Shooters Association ya Australie (NSW) Inc, bazwaki bato ya bolingo malamu babongi mpona kobengama bato na Sporting Shooters Association.""  This translates to: ""In one discussion between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, they rejected people with good intentions who wanted to discuss with people from the Sporting Shooters Association.""  This directly indicates they *didn't* use a first attempt at a compromise.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bato oyo bazalaki kobeta masasi bazalaki kozwa mateya ya koyekola:** (Shooters were given the opportunity to train) - The passage talks about *requiring* training, not giving opportunities.
* **C: Bato oyo babetaki masasi bazalaki kotambwisama na babateli zamba:** (Shooters were accompanied by experienced guides) - The passage doesn't mention guides.
* **D: Baponaki bato minei oyo bazalaki kobeta masasi:** (They identified people who were shooting) - While true, this isn’t the answer to the question about what wasn't done to prevent shooting of bad animals.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, wapi bokabwani ezwamaki?","The correct answer is **D: Na Éthiopie**.

Here's why:

The passage states Berhane Asfaw is from the Rift Valley Research Service **in Ethiopia** and conducts research there. The question asks where the fossils were found. While the Rift Valley *is* a location, Ethiopia is the country where the research (and therefore the fossil discovery) takes place.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Na Rift Valley:**  The Rift Valley is a geographical *region*, not a specific location where the fossils were *found*.
* **B: Na eloko ya kala moko:** (In one old thing) This is too vague and doesn't pinpoint the location.
* **C: Na bilembeteli ya molécule:** (In the arrangement of molecules) This refers to how they study the fossils, not where they are found.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, nini elobami te lokola eloko ekoki kotinda banyama ya zamba basala yo mabe?","The correct answer is **B: Bokabwani yango** (This discovery).

Here's why:

* **P's statement** discusses a discovery (""na kotalela eloko oyo bauti komona"") – a find of something new. It then links this discovery to understanding how life evolved (""ndenge tokanisaka yango na bilembeteli ya molecule"").  The quote emphasizes *what* was discovered is important for understanding evolution.

* **Q's question** asks what doesn't fit as something that could cause ancient animals to behave badly.  The context is about understanding evolution through a *discovery*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bokutani ya biloko ya kala (Fossilization of ancient creatures):** Fossilization *is* related to ancient animals, so it doesn’t “not fit”.
* **C: Botaleli ya bilembeteli moléculaires (Understanding of molecular genetics):** This is the *result* of the discovery, the tool used to understand, not the discovery itself. It doesn’t represent something that would cause bad behavior.
* **D: Bolukiluki oyo esalemaki na Rift Valley (The research conducted in the Rift Valley):** This is where the discovery was made, but not the discovery itself.



Therefore, the “discovery” (bokabwani yango) is the element that stands out as not being a cause of bad animal behavior, making it the correct answer."
Nini ekosenga mosani asala mpo na kosala muvema na ntango ya lisano ya vidéo?,"The correct answer is **C: Tia oyo ezozua pene ya télévision na bango**.

Here's why:

The passage states the controller uses sensors ""pene ya televizio ya moto azosalela yango po esala triangle na esika ezala na balolenge misato"" (near the television to detect movement and direction).  This means the user *moves themselves* in relation to the TV to control the game.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sala ete oyo ezolandela ezala pene ya ya console** - This translates to ""Do what follows is near the console"". The text focuses on interaction with the *television*, not the console itself.
*   **B: Tia bango lokola triangle** - This translates to ""Hold them like a triangle"". This doesn't reflect the function of the sensors.
*   **D: Tambolisa oyo ezolanda na kati ya mopepe** - This translates to ""Move what is in the hand"". While you *hold* the controller, the action isn't simply about hand movement, but full body movement detected by the TV's sensors.



"
Nini esalemaki mpo ezala lokola télécommande ya v?,"The correct answer is **B: Oyo ezolanda ya Révolution Nintendo** (It is the innovation of Nintendo Revolution).

Here's why:

* **The passage states the controller is ""ndenge moko na télécommande ya televizio"" (like a TV remote).** It's specifically presented as a new feature *of* the Nintendo Revolution console.
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **A: Oyo mibale bazozua yao yo ezolanda** (These many innovations) - Too vague. The passage focuses on *one* key innovation - the controller.
    * **C: Lisolo ya ntina mingi** (A lot of history) - Irrelevant to the passage.
    * **D: Console ya Révolution ya Nintendo** (Nintendo Revolution console) -  While the controller *is* part of the console, the question asks what *makes it* like a remote, not what it *is* part of.



"
Nini elobamaki te na rapport ya sika ya biro ya sango Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **A: Mpepo yango ezwaki likama ya kobwaka bombe**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Barapore ya nsima emonisi ete babangisaka mpepo ete bakobeta yango bombe..."" (The recent report shows they were making the wind to make it a bomb...). This directly indicates the wind was intended to be used as a bomb.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mpepo yango ekitanaki na Ürümqi** - The passage mentions Ürümqi in the context of offering a route to the attackers, not the wind's origin.
* **C: Balekisi mpepo yango na Afghanistan** - While they *sent* the wind to Afghanistan, the report revealed its intended *purpose*.
* **D: Mpepo yango ekitaki na Kandahar** - Kandahar is the destination of the wind, not what the report revealed about it.



"
Nini elobamaki te na rapport ya liboso ya biro ya sika ya Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **A: Bazwaki mpɛpɔ yango na makasi** (They stole the wind in a sack).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Liboso lisanga ya Chine ya kopanza-basango Xinhua balobaki ete bakangi mpepo moko."" (The Chinese news agency Xinhua reports that they caught a wind.)  This implies they *captured* or *stole* the wind.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Baboyaki mpepo yango ekita na mbalakaka** (They released the wind near a riot) - The passage says they *sent* the wind to Afghanistan, not released it near a riot.
* **C: Balekisakiango lisusu na Afghanistan** (They released it again in Afghanistan) - The passage doesn't say they released it *again*, just that they sent it there.
* **D: Mpepo yango ezwaki likama ya kobwaka bombe** (The wind was used to cause explosions) - While the wind was *used* for something problematic, the passage doesn't say it *was* explosives themselves. It says it was used to make them work better.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate reflection of what the Xinhua report initially stated."
Nini esakolamaki na Sara Danius na ntango ya programme ya radio?,"The correct answer is **C: Bato oyo bampo nampo namaki mpo na koswa mbano ya Nobel na makambo ya mikanda na 2016** (The situation surrounding the awarding of the Nobel Prize in light of the controversy in 2016).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states Danius discussed the difficulties and tensions surrounding the decision to award Bob Dylan the Nobel Prize in 2016.** She talked about the reactions, the criticism, and the overall problematic situation.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Molongi ya Prix Nobel ya bokomi** (Nobel Prize award ceremony) - The passage doesn't focus on the ceremony itself, but on the *lead-up* and fallout from the decision.
    * **B: Komite yango ezwi biyano moko te epai ya basalani** (The committee didn't regret its decision regarding the contestants) -  Danius's statements clearly show *regret* and acknowledgment of problems, not a lack of regret.
    * **D: Komite ekotika milende mpo na kosala boyokani na Bob Dylan** (The committee spent time trying to reconcile with Bob Dylan) - While she mentions trying to reach Dylan, the passage focuses more on the internal struggle and public reaction.



"
Nani akokaki te kokutana na ye?,"The correct answer is **D: Bob Dylan**.

Here's why:

The passage states Sara Danius tried repeatedly to contact Bob Dylan *before* informing him he'd won the 2016 Nobel Prize, and then tried to reach him *after* announcing the win.  The phrase ""azokoka te kosolola na Bob Dylan mbala moko"" translates to ""failed to reach Bob Dylan once again.""  The question asks who she couldn't get in touch with.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bob Dylan’s oyo azalaki kosala elongo na ye** - This is a vague description and doesn’t directly answer the question.
*   **B: Sara Danius** - The passage is *about* Sara Danius trying to contact someone, not her inability to contact herself.
*   **C: The Swedish Academy** - The passage doesn’t mention her having trouble contacting the Swedish Academy.



"
Nani alobaki ete elaka yango ezali “litambe monene”?,"The correct answer is **C: Gordon Johndroe**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Molobeli ya Bush, Gordon Johndroe, abengaki komipesa ya Corée ya nordi """"etambe monene mpona kokokisa mokano ya kolongola mandoki ya nikleyere na esanga ya Corée."""""". This directly translates to ""Bush's spokesperson, Gordon Johndroe, issued a statement to North Korea calling it 'a big threat' regarding the effort to eliminate nuclear weapons in North Korea.""

Therefore, Gordon Johndroe is the one who described something as “litambe monene” (a big threat).



"
Słania ebimisaki batimbre boni mpo na bikolo mingi?,"The correct answer is **B: 1000**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Asalaki batimbre koleka 1 000 mpona Suède..."" which translates to ""He released approximately 1000 stamps in Sweden...""

Therefore, Słania released 1000 stamps for Sweden. The other options are incorrect as they either state a different number or an approximation (""approximately 2000"").



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekoki kozala ntina ya kokoba kotanga uta na bisika ya kopelisa mopepe ya batono?","The correct answer is **A: Esika ya bokangami ya mibale oyo ezali kotondisama na makoki** (The location of the large spill which is associated with pumps).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the spill originated near the pumps at Fort Greely 9.**  The issue was a valve failure that released oil into the pipeline, impacting the pumps and a large storage tank.  This makes the *location* of the spill, specifically related to the pumps, the most direct cause for concern about potential contamination of drinking water.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Momekano ya mbala na mbala ya ndenge moto ezosala** (Different ways people behave) - This is irrelevant to a pipeline spill.
* **C: Bopanzani ya molunge** (Environmental differences) - While environmental factors *could* affect the spread of a spill, they aren't the *cause* of the potential drinking water contamination.
* **D: Moto oyo ezikaki na moko ya bisika ya pompe ya Fort Greely** (Someone who works at the Fort Greely pump station) - A worker isn’t the cause of the contamination, but a mechanical failure is.



"
Mpo na nini bisika ya kokanga efungwamaki?,"The correct answer is **A: Ezalaki na bopanzani ya molunge na kati ya batono** (It was a pressure difference between the barrels).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kofungola bavannes esalisi na kokitisa pression na ebongiseli wana mpe mafuta ekitaki na tanki moko oyo ekoki kobatela batono 55 000…"" (Opening the valves helped equalize pressure in the pipeline and oil flowed into a tank that could hold 55,000 barrels...).  This directly indicates the valves were opened to address a pressure difference.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ezalaki bozangi ya lotiliki nsima ya komeka yango** (It was a consequence of starting to operate it) - While the incident happened *during* operation, the valve opening wasn't *because* of simply starting the pipeline. It was to fix a specific issue.
* **C: Batono batondaki** (Barrels were leaking) - The text doesn't mention leaking barrels, it mentions oil flowing *into* a tank.
* **D: Esika ya bokangami ya mibale ekokaki te kosimba bitunga ekoki** (The pumping station could not hold enough barrels) -  The text indicates the tank *could* hold 55,000 barrels, not that it was insufficient.



"
"Sikawa, mai ezali likoló boni na The Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **C: Ekómaka tii na loketo** (It reached the levees).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ndako ya libwa, oyo mai ekotelaka yango kino na 20 feet na ntango ya mopepe makasi Katrina, eza sikoyo na mai kino na loketo po mwa libulu ya mai ya pene etondaki mpenza."" This translates to ""The flood waters, which reached 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina, are now reaching the levees to try and breach them.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 20 makolo (20 feet):** While the water *reached* 20 feet, the passage emphasizes it's now impacting the levees.
* **B: 6 inches:**  This refers to the initial estimate of rainfall, not the height of the floodwaters.
* **D: 100 makolo (100 feet):**  This is the width of the breach in the levee, not the height of the water itself.



"
"Na ntango ya mopɛpɛ makasi Katrina, nini esalemaki na The Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **C: Mai ya mpela ezalaki na bolai ya metre 20**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the levee (ndako ya libwa) broke and was initially built to withstand 6 inches of rainfall, but failed during Katrina with 20 feet of water. 20 feet is approximately 6 meters (a bit more precisely, it's around 6.1 meters, but the closest option is 20 meters, which is close enough given the context).
* The passage explicitly links this 20-foot (approximately 6-meter) water level to what happened in The Ninth Ward.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mai ya mpela ezalaki na bonene ya metre 100:** The passage states the *breach* in the levee was 100 feet wide, not the depth of the water.
* **B: Mai oyo ekómaki tii na loketo ezalaki likoló ya libongo:** While the situation was devastating, the passage doesn't mention it being a ""river of blood.""
* **D: Mbula ya 6 pouces ebukaki levee oyo ebebaki:**  This is what the levee was *designed* to withstand, not what actually happened during Katrina. The levee *failed* when faced with 20 feet of water.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi endimisamaki te na Hamilton?","The correct answer is **A: Esika oyo mobeli yango asalaki mobembo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Hamilton criticized the University of Howard Hospital for *isolating* patients with a disease.**  The key word here is ""isolating.""  ""Esika oyo mobeli yango asalaki mobembo"" translates to ""Where the patient is isolated."" This directly relates to Hamilton's criticism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Likoki ya kozwa mobeli mosusu na virus (The ability to infect another person with the virus):** While Ebola *is* infectious, the passage focuses on the *method* of dealing with patients, not the virus's transmission.
* **C: Soki mokanda ya kosala elandamaki (If a document were to be created):**  This is irrelevant to Hamilton's criticism.
* **D: Ezalela ya mobeli ya lelo (The patient's current condition):** The passage doesn't discuss the patient's current state, only the hospital's practice of isolation.



"
Nini ezali likambo oyo batu ya siansi balingi koyeba?,"The correct answer is **D: Ndenge nini Mabele esalemaki** (How plants grow).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Bato ya siansi bakanisi bakoyeba ndenge baplanete esalemaka, mingimingi ndenge Mabele esalemaki...""  This directly translates to ""Scientists are researching how planets grow, particularly how plants grow.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ntango mioto ekutanaki na Mabele (When light reaches plants):** While important to plant growth, the passage doesn't focus *specifically* on *when* light reaches plants, but *how* they grow.
* **B: Ndenge oyo baproteini esalemaka (How proteins are made):**  The passage doesn't mention proteins.
* **C: Eloko organique ezali nini (What organic matter is):** The passage doesn't define organic matter, it assumes the reader understands it's related to life and sustenance.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, mosala nini bapolisi ya mboka basalaki na bokangami?","The correct answer is **A: Basengaki na FBI ete esala bokangami yango** (They requested the FBI to investigate the incident).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""mokonzi ya transport ya Maryland akangaki nzela na kolanda toli ya FBI."" (The Maryland transportation secretary requested an investigation and contacted the FBI.)
* This directly supports the idea that the police (through the transportation secretary) *asked* the FBI to investigate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bazwaki ekateli ya kosala bokangami** (They refused to conduct an investigation) - The passage implies an investigation *was* requested, not refused.
* **C: Bazalaki kotambwisa bato oyo bazalaki kotambwisa mituka na banzela mosusu** (They were arresting people who were driving trucks on other roads) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.  The police were observing drivers.
* **D: Balobaki ete mituka eumelaki na nzela mosusu** (They said trucks were moving on other roads) - While true, this is an *observation* of what was happening, not the action the police were taking – they were requesting an investigation.



"
Nini esalemaki na esika ya kokotisa tiyo ntango ya bokangami?,"The correct answer is **B: Bazalaki kosalela yango lokola nzela ya kopengwisa** (They were using it as a way to block the road).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mituka oyo ebendaka biloko basalelaki yango mpona kokanga nzela ya kokotela"" - ""The vehicles were blocking it to hinder traffic.""  This directly indicates the vehicles were being used to *block* the road, which is a way of disrupting/blocking access.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bazalaki kokanga bango** (They were crashing them) - The passage doesn't mention crashes.
* **C: Bazalaki polele mpo na bakumbi mituka** (They were waiting for many vehicles) - This is not stated in the passage.
* **D: Ezalaki na mituka mingi oyo ezalaki komema** (There were many vehicles that were stuck) - While there were many vehicles present, the key issue was they were *being used* to block the road, not just stuck.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini esalemaki te liboso ete motuka ebeta moto oyo akangaki fotó?","The correct answer is **B: Moto oyo azwaki bafɔtɔ atɛlɛmisaki motuka na ye pembeni Sepulveda Boulevard**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...moto akangaka bafoto atelemisaki motuka na ye na ngambo oyo mosusu ya balabala Sepulveda..."" This directly translates to ""the person taking photos crashed into his car on the side of Sepulveda Boulevard.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage states the photographer was *pulled over* by the Highway Patrol, not that they were already on the other side of the road.
* **C:** While the police investigated, the reason for the accident wasn't because the photographer was taking pictures *at* a police scene.
* **D:** The passage doesn’t say the photographer was trying to get pictures *of* Bieber; it simply states they were taking pictures of him.



"
Mokangami ya bafoto azalaki komeka kosala nini liboso ete motuka ebɛta ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Telemisa motuka Sepulveda Boulevard**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""moto akangaka bafoto atelemisaki motuka na ye na ngambo oyo mosusu ya balabala Sepulveda..."" This directly translates to ""the photographer was hit by a car on Sepulveda Boulevard.""  The act of *driving the car* is what led to the photographer being hit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bokanga bafot ya esika ya kotelema ya polisi** - While the photographer *attempted* to photograph the police, this wasn't the cause of the accident.
* **C: Katisa nzela monene oyo bato bazali mingi** - The text doesn't say the photographer was blocking a busy road.
* **D: Kondimisa polisi moko atika ye akoba kobɛta masasi** -  The text doesn't mention a police officer trying to shoot him.



"
Liloba nini ezali kolimbola na bosikisiki te ezalela ya ndenge ya mokambi ya ekolo azuaki nsima na kozwama na virus?,"The correct answer is **A: Azali koyoka malamu te** (He is not seriously ill).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sante ya president eza malamu"" (The president's health is good) and ""nakoki kosala mosala na ngai na mosika"" (I can work with him normally).  This clearly indicates the president is *not* seriously ill.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Azali na mpasi na zolo** (He is ill in the stomach) - The passage mentions fever and fatigue, not stomach issues.
    * **C: Azali kotungisama teétat stable** (He is not stabilizing) - The passage implies the opposite - he *is* stable enough to work.
    * **D: Azali na nzoto moto** (He has a strong fever) - While there was a past fever (""Longola fievre""), the speaker says ""naza malamu"" (I am well now) implying the fever is gone.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, maloba oyo elandi na ntinan oyo etali président, oyo wapi ezali ya solo?","The correct answer is **B: Akotikala na ndako na boumeli ya bapɔsɔ mingi.**

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Sante ya president eza malamu, kasi akomifandela na ndako na ye moko mpona mikolo mawa mingi."" (The president's health is good, but he is struggling with weakness for many days now.)
* **Q asks:** About the president's condition, specifically what is causing it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Azali na nzoto moto te (He doesn't have a serious illness):** While the passage says his health *is* good, it also mentions weakness, contradicting this option.
* **C: Azali malamu mpo na kosala mosala na ye na mosika (He is well enough to work on his desk):** This is what *Arias* says he can do, not the president.  It's about Arias' ability, not the president's condition.
* **D: Azali na ndenge moko ya makasi ya virus (He has a type of viral infection):** The passage doesn't specify a viral infection, only weakness and a previous fever.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text. It directly addresses the president's weakness mentioned in the passage."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ntango nini mopepe makasi Gonu esengelaki kokoba kolɛmba?","The correct answer is **B: Ntango mipepe ekitanaki tii na kilomɛtrɛ soki 83 na ngonga moko** (When the cyclone reached a speed of approximately 83 km/h).

Here's why:

The passage states ""Lelo na ntongo makasi, mopepe ezalaki pene ya 83 km/h, mpe tozalaki kozela ekoba kolemba."" which translates to ""Today with the storm, the cyclone was around 83 km/h, and we started to prepare to evacuate."" This directly links the preparation for evacuation to the cyclone's speed reaching 83 km/h.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Liboso ya kokóma na Maldives** (The beginning in the Maldives) - While the cyclone *started* in the Maldives, the question asks *when* they prepared to evacuate, not where it began.
* **C: Liboso ya kokóma na nsonge na yango** (The beginning at this time) - Too vague and doesn't relate to specific details in the text.
* **D: Liboso ya kokóma na mipɛpɛ ya kilomɛtrɛ 149 na ngonga moko** (The beginning at a speed of 149 kilometers per hour) - This refers to the cyclone's *maximum* speed, not the speed at which evacuation preparations began.



"
Mipepe ezalaki mbangu ndenge nini na nsɔngɛ ya mopepe makasi Gonu?,"The correct answer is **B: 240 miles par heure**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""mopepe euti na nkombo ya saki moko ya makasa ya nzete ya mbila na lokota ya Maldives, ekomaki na vitese ya makasi ya bakilometele 240 na ngonga moko (149 miles na ngonga moko).""  This directly translates to: ""the cyclone was moving at a maximum speed of 240 kilometers per hour (149 miles per hour).""

While 83 km/h is mentioned later, that's the speed *today* (leo), not the maximum speed of Gonu itself. The question asks about how strong the cyclone *was*.
"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi etalelami te lokola ezaleli ya Karenia brevis?","The correct answer is **C: Ezali na ba cellules ebele** (It is made of simple cells).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""eloko moko ya nse ya mai oyo ezalaka na selile moko"" - this translates to ""a type of marine organism that is made of a single cell."" This directly identifies *Karenia brevis* as being composed of simple cells.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ezali lolenge moko ya ba algues** (It is a type of algae) - While true, the passage *describes* it as a type of algae, it doesn't *define* it as such.  The question asks what *defines* it.
* **B: Ekoki kopekisa misisa ya bato** (It can cause illness in humans) - This is a *result* of *Karenia brevis*, not what it *is*.  The passage discusses its toxins and effects, but doesn't define the organism itself by this.
* **D: Esalemaka na ndenge ya bomoto** (It behaves like an animal) - The passage doesn't provide any information suggesting it behaves like an animal. It's clearly identified as a marine organism, specifically a type of algae.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi Karena brevis azali na makoki ya kosala te?","The correct answer is **A: Désactiver ba nerfs na mbisi** (Disable nerves in animals).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Baalgues ebimisaka eloko babengi neurotoxine oyo ekangaka bansinga ya boongo na bato mpe na bambisi."" (Algae produce a toxin that damages the nervous systems of humans and animals.)

This directly indicates that *Karenia brevis* (the algae) has the ability to disrupt nerve function.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bobakisa noki na motango na nse ya ezalela nyonso** (Make it difficult to swim in all waters) - The passage doesn't mention swimming difficulties, just problems with consuming or being near affected water.
* **C: Kosala bopusi likoló na mai** (Cause a strong smell in the water) - While the passage mentions changes in water appearance, it doesn't focus on smell.
* **D: Kobimisa neurotoxine moko** (Release one neurotoxin) -  The passage says it *produces* a neurotoxin, not that it *is* a neurotoxin itself.  It's the algae that creates the toxin.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi esalemaki te mpo na mopɛpɛ makasi Félicia?","The correct answer is **A: Mbula ya litomba** (Rainy season).

Here's why:

* **P's text describes a very strong hurricane (Category 4 Saffir-Simpson) and significant rainfall (6.34 inches).** It also mentions that rainfall is common in Oahu, and other islands experience flooding frequently.
* **The phrase ""ntina"" (flooding) is used to describe the heavy rainfall.**
* **The text concludes by stating that other islands are also experiencing problems and flooding is frequent.**

This all points to the conditions being particularly bad *during the rainy season*.  The other options don't fit the context:

* **B: Mbula ebetaka elongo na nkake (Season that lengthens with time)** -  Doesn't relate to the storm or flooding.
* **C: Nkake oyo ezongaka mbala na mbala (Time that repeats itself)** -  Too vague and doesn't explain the *why* of the intense weather.
* **D: Mpela ya balabala (Cost of damage)** - Focuses on the result of the storm, not the time of year it's happening.



"
Maloba nini oyo elobeli mopepe makasi Felicia ezali lokuta?,"The correct answer is **B: Ezalaki liboso na catégorie lokola dépression tropicale avant ebongwana na tempête ya catégorie 4**

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Felicia, oyo ezalaki naino mopepepe ya nivo 4 na molongo ya mipepe makasi Saffir-Simpson..."" (Felicia, which was a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale...). This directly indicates Felicia *started* as something less powerful before becoming a Category 4 hurricane.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mbula oyo ebɛtaki yango epesaki Oahu matomba:** While the text mentions Oahu received a lot of rain, it doesn't say the rain *caused* the hurricane.
* **C: Mingi ya bisanga yango emonanaki na mbula:** The text says monitoring was difficult *due to* the rain, not that the rain was the main thing monitored.
* **D: Mbula ebetaki mwa moke elongo na nkake:** The text mentions other storms happening elsewhere, but doesn't connect them specifically to Felicia's strength.



"
Liloba nini ezali komonisa na bosikisiki mbano ya Grand Prix ya Hongrie na 2009?,"The correct answer is **C: Babenganaki Piquet Jr. na mosala nsima na yango**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Piquet Jr. balongoki ye na mosala nsima ya Grand Prix ya Hongrie ya 2009."" This translates to ""Piquet Jr. was blamed for the crash after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.""  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fernando Alonso azwaki likama** - The passage doesn't mention Alonso crashing in the Hungarian Grand Prix.
* **B: Piquet Jr. nde azwaki elonga yango** - While Piquet Jr. *was involved* in a crash, the passage focuses on him being *blamed* for it, not necessarily causing it himself.
* **D: Motuka ya libateli ezwaki likama** - The passage doesn’t mention the safety car crashing.



"
Likama yango ekweaki ntango nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Mbala moke sima ya pit stop ya Alonso**.

Here's why:

The passage states Piquet Jr. crashed *after* Alonso had just left the pit lane, and was attempting to overtake. This directly links the crash to the timing immediately following Alonso's pit stop.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ntango mituka mosusu ezalaki kopesa esansi:** While other cars may have been fueling, the passage specifically connects the incident to Alonso's pit stop.
*   **C: Liboso motuka ya bokengi ebima:** The passage doesn't say the crash was caused by another car crashing into Piquet.
*   **D: Nsima Piquet akoti mpo nampo na carburant:** The passage says Piquet was *overtaking* when the crash happened, not refueling.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezwaki ntango moke koleka oyo balukiluki bakanisaki na ebandeli?","The correct answer is **D: Evolution ya espèce ya bikelamu (Evolution of bird species)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly discusses the study of finches (birds) in the Galapagos Islands.**  It focuses on how different finch species (Geospiza fortes and Geospiza conirostris) have adapted.
* **The study investigates how the beak shape of these finches has changed over time.** This is a key component of evolutionary adaptation.
* **The passage mentions ""lolenge ya sika"" (beak shape) and its relation to ""milongo mibale"" (many generations),** directly linking the research to the evolutionary process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bokeli ya lolenge ya nyama (Animal shape problem):**  While beak shape *is* a shape, the study isn't just about the general shape of animals, but specifically the *evolution* of beak shape in finches.
* **B: Bokeli ya kopesa ya nyama (Animal feeding problem):** The passage doesn't focus on a problem with animal feeding, but on the *adaptation* of beaks *for* feeding.
* **C: Kobota kati na mitindo ndenge na ndenge (Mixing among different styles):**  This doesn’t accurately reflect the scientific investigation of evolutionary adaptation.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate and comprehensive answer, capturing the core subject of the passage."
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi elobamaki te na balukiluki?","The correct answer is **B: Bolai ya mosala ya evolisyo (The process of evolution)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses how finch beak shape (a trait) has *changed* over time due to environmental pressures (cactus availability).** This *is* evolution in action.  The study is *demonstrating* the process of evolution.
* **The passage *shows* the results of evolution, but doesn't focus on the *process* itself being the subject of the research.**  It's about observing *how* evolution happens in this specific case.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Esika oyo lolenge ya sika ya banyama esalemaki (Where animal traits are inherited)** -  The passage demonstrates that traits *can* change, not just that they're inherited. Inheritance is implied, but not the core focus.
* **C: Nkombo ya lolenge ya sika (A combination of traits)** - The passage specifically focuses on beak *shape* as the trait in question. It doesn't discuss a combination of traits generally.
* **D: Bandeke oyo ekotaka na mosala ya kobota (Populations that can adapt)** -  While adaptation is a part of the story, the research is not *about* the potential for adaptation, but documenting adaptation *actually happening*.



Therefore, the research is focused on *observing* and *understanding* the process of evolution itself, making **B** the correct answer."
CowParade ekosalema wapi?,"The correct answer is **B: Na engumba Bucarest**.

The text specifically states: ""...Engumba wana [Bucarest] ekozala engumba ya liboso ya Eropa ya sudi este na koyamba masano CowParade..."" which translates to ""...That city [Bucarest] will be the first city in South-Eastern Europe to host the CowParade...""

While it *might* expand to other cities, the initial location mentioned is Bucarest. The other options are too broad or inaccurate based on the provided text."
"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola na bosikisiki CowParade?","The correct answer is **C: Ezali likambo ya mayele oyo esalemaka na eleko ya moi na sud-est ya Europe mobimba** (It is a cultural event that takes place in the southeast of Europe extensively).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Engumba wana ekozala engumba ya liboso ya Eropa ya sudi este na koyamba masano CowParade..."" (The city could become a leading city in southeastern Europe by hosting the CowParade...) This directly links the CowParade to being a significant event in southeastern Europe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Na maloba oyo, oyo wapi ezali na bosikisiki “kobongisa”** (In that statement, what is the focus of ""promote""?) - This asks about the *purpose* of something, not the location or nature of the CowParade.
* **B: Esalemaki na Ndako ya Bokonzi ya Bucarest City Hall** (It is held at the Bucharest City Hall) - The passage doesn't state *where* the CowParade is held, only that Bucharest is considering hosting it.
* **D: Ezali likambo ya mayele ya polele mpo na batu mingi mayele kati na mokili** (It is a popular cultural event for many people enjoying themselves at the time) - While likely true, this is a general description, not specific information *from the passage* about what the CowParade *is*.



"
Nini esalaki ete Russie etelemisa kosalela ba avions II-76?,"The correct answer is **B: Likama moko** (An accident).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Russie atiaki na ntango moke na mabele ba Il-76 nsima ya likama wana."" which translates to ""Russia grounded all Il-76s after that accident."" 

Therefore, the reason Russia stopped using the Il-76 planes was due to an accident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Basoda ya kati ya mboka** (Internal troops) - While the passage mentions the plane was used by internal troops, it doesn't say this is *why* they were grounded.
*   **C: Basoda ya Soviétique** (Soviet troops) - The plane's history with Soviet troops is background information, not the reason for grounding.
*   **D: Boluki moko oyo ezali kozela** (A company that owned them) - The passage doesn't mention anything about ownership as the reason for grounding.



"
II-76 ezali nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Engbunduka moko** (An aircraft).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Il-76 eza eteni moko ya ntina mingi ya mampinga ya Russie pe ya Union Sovietique..."" which translates to ""Il-76 is a type of many military aircraft of Russia and the Soviet Union...""

Therefore, Il-76 is an aircraft. Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Masuwa moko oyo ezali na nse ya mai** (A water vehicle) - Il-76 flies, it doesn't travel on water.
*   **B: Tono moko** (A sound) - Il-76 is a physical object, not a sound.
*   **C: Mpepo moko** (A wind) - The text actually *mentions* wind affecting the situation, but Il-76 isn't wind itself.



"
Nani azwaki ekipi ya bakomi mpo na The Simpsons?,"The correct answer is **D: Groening**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...asalaki na kosala Simpsons elongo na Brooks pe Groening, mpe ye moto azwaki na mosala ekipe ya liboso oyo bazalaki kokoma basango.""  This translates to ""...he started working on The Simpsons with Brooks and Groening, and he was the one who created the team of writers who were running the show.""

Therefore, Groening is the one who created the writing team for The Simpsons.



"
"Engebene Fluke, nani azalaki kotindela ye makanisi ya malamu mpe kolendisa ye?","The correct answer is **C: Mibali**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""...mibali, bazolendisa ye na kondima ete baloba ete bakisi oyo ekangaka basi nzela ya kozwa zemi ekoma bakisi ya ntina mingi.""  This translates to ""...families, they helped him with the condition so that they say that this sickness shows them the way to get rich and become families of great wealth.""

This directly indicates that **families (mibali)** were the ones supporting Fluke and encouraging the belief that his condition brought them wealth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Minganga (Doctors):** The passage doesn't mention doctors helping or influencing Fluke.
*   **B: Misala ya bokolongono ya basi (Family political situations):** This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Nyoso mibali na basi (All families in the area):** The passage doesn't state *all* families were involved, only that *families* were helping him.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, bato mosusu balingaki te basi baloba na ntina na nini?","The correct answer is **C: Bokolongono ya basi** (The authority of the chiefs).

Here's why:

* **P's statement** describes a situation where people are being misled and manipulated (""bazosala mpona kokanga basi nzela balobela te"") by those in power, leading them to believe falsehoods (""bakisi oyo ekangaka basi nzela ya kozwa zemi"").  This is happening *because* those in power are maintaining their authority.
* **Q asks** what prevents others from speaking the truth (""basi baloba na ntina na nini?"").
* **Bokolongono ya basi** (the authority of the chiefs) directly answers that question. The chiefs' power *is* what silences others. They control the narrative and suppress dissent.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Batu mokomoko ya mibali** (Groups of people) - This is too vague. It doesn't explain *why* people can't speak the truth.
* **B: Kofuta nkisi** (Practicing witchcraft) - This is irrelevant to the passage's theme of manipulation and control through authority.
* **D: Libaku** (Lies) - While lies are *part* of the problem, they don't explain *why* people are afraid or unable to counter them.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nzoto nini ya planɛti ezali na nguya mingi?","The correct answer is **A: Mabele**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...na ndenge toyebeli, eza kaka na nzoto moko oyo elakisaka makasi mingi koleka Titan, pe nkombo na yango eza Mabele.""  This translates to ""...as we see it, there is only one planet that has more mass than Titan, and its name is Mabele.""

Therefore, Mabele is the planet with the most mass mentioned in the text.



"
Bibale mpe mabeke oyo ezali na mai oyo ezali polele emonisami na nzoto nini ya planeti?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""...eza kaka na nzoto moko oyo elakisaka makasi mingi koleka Titan, pe nkombo na yango eza Mabele.""  This translates to ""...it is only in one ocean which is much larger than Titan, and its name is Mabele.""

This directly links the ocean being discussed to Titan.  The question asks which planet's ocean the passage is referencing, and Titan is the one mentioned.



"
Nini kati na makambo oyo bamoni ezali te mbuma ya bokutani ya nsala?,"The correct answer is **B: Bososoli été nsala ezalaki kosalelama te na kopumbwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lolenge masala ezali emonisi ete basalelaka yango te mpona kopumbwa kasi mpona makambo ya temperature to ndenge ezomonana.""  This translates to ""The conditions of the flesh are such that it doesn't allow for preservation unless under temperature or other conditions.""  This directly addresses the difficulty of finding intact dinosaur flesh – it doesn't *preserve* well.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Langi ya nsala ya nyama (The smell of the meat)** - The passage mentions the smell, but it doesn't say it's the main issue preventing understanding.
* **C: Bososoli ya evolisyo ya nsala (The evolution of flesh)** - While the passage touches on evolution in relation to dinosaur remains, it's not the central problem discussed.
* **D: Bondimami été Confirmation que badinosaure mingi bazalaki na nsala (Confirmation that many dinosaurs had flesh)** -  The passage *assumes* dinosaurs had flesh, it doesn't focus on confirming that fact.  The problem is what happens *to* that flesh over time.



"
Nsala ya dinosaure ezalaki na nini te?,"The correct answer is **C: Nsala ya mikolo** (Skin of the young).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ndakisa emonisi masala ya mokolo kasi ya mwana te."" which translates to ""...the evidence shows the skin of the young, not the adult.""

This directly indicates that the dinosaur skin found was from juvenile dinosaurs, not adult ones. The passage discusses difficulties in finding adult dinosaur skin because it doesn't fossilize as easily.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Barbules:** Not mentioned in the text.
*   **B: Nkisi:** This likely refers to spiritual power or charm, and is not related to dinosaur skin.
*   **D: Mopanzi ya nse ya langi ya motane:** This translates to ""large heavenly bird feather,"" which is irrelevant to the passage's focus on dinosaur skin.



"
"Na ba affirmations oyo elandi mpo na ZMapp, oyo wapi ezali ya solo te?","The correct answer is **B: Ezali na makoki ya kosalisa ba infections oyo ezali kasi kopekisa liwa te** (It has the ability to treat infections but not prevent death).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ZMapp emonanaki naino ete ekosalisa mingi ntango bamekaki yango, kasi bolukiluki emonisi ete ekosalisa mingi mpenza te na kokanga nzela na liwa ndenge bakanisaki.""  This translates to ""ZMapp showed some promise when administered, but studies show it didn't significantly prevent death as hoped.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Esalemi na ba anticorps (It is made of antibodies):** While likely true, the passage *doesn't* state this.  It focuses on what it *does*, not what it's *made of*.
* **C: Esalaki lokola kolanda kosamba ya PALM (It served as a model for the PALM study):** The passage says PALM followed ZMapp, but doesn't say ZMapp was a *model* for it.  It was used as a point of comparison.
* **D: Bolukiluki emonisi ete matomba na yango ezali moke koleka oyo bakanisaki na ebandeli (Studies show its effects were better than initially expected):**  The opposite is true. The passage states studies showed its effects were *not* as good as initially hoped (specifically, it didn't prevent death).



"
"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola na bosikisiki bomekoli ya PALM?","The correct answer is **B: Bakokanisaki nkisi moko ya témoin na ba traitements misato mosusu, moko na yango ezalaki ZMapp**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Na ntango ya komeka PALM, ZMapp esalisaki na kolandela, elimboli ete bato ya sinasi basalelaki yango lokola modele pe bakokanisaki bikisi misato mosusu."" This directly translates to: ""During the PALM outbreak, ZMapp was used in follow-up, implying that scientists used it as a model and compared it to other treatments.""  This clearly indicates ZMapp was compared to other treatments (and a control/témoin group) within the PALM study.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage mentions potential limitations of ZMapp's effectiveness, not that it *caused* more deaths.
* **C:** While ZMapp *was* used, the passage states it was used *in comparison* to other treatments, not simply as a baseline.
* **D:** The passage doesn't state it was proven good for treating the disease, only that initial findings were promising but further study revealed limitations.



"
Balukiluki bakanisi ete wapi puce ya sika ekozala na ntina mingi?,"The correct answer is **C: Na États-Unis**.

Here's why:

The passage states the ink used in the test can be produced for a cent *in the United States* (""mwa eloko moko oyo bakoki kosala na lisalisi ya ba imprimantes à jet ya encre po ezala na talo ya cent moko ya Etats-Unis""). The question asks where the ink is most likely to be found in abundance.  Therefore, the United States is the logical answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bikolo oyo ezali na mbongo mingi te (Countries with little money):** The passage doesn't relate cost of countries to ink availability.
*   **B: Bikolo oyo ezali na bozwi mingi (Countries with a lot of illness):** While the ink is *used* to detect illnesses, the question is about where the ink *itself* is found.
*   **D: Na Stanford University (At Stanford University):** Stanford is where the research is being done, not necessarily where the ink is mass-produced.



"
Nzela nini ekosalelama mpo na kotonga esaleli ya koyeba malali?,"The correct answer is **A: Centime moko U.S. mpo na moko** (One U.S. cent per test).

Here's why:

The passage states the test can be produced for the cost of *one cent* using inkjet printers. This is the key element of how affordable the test is, and therefore the answer to how much it costs to develop the test.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Masini ya kobeta mikanda oyo endimami inkjet** (Inkjet printer) - While inkjet printers are *used* to create the test, they aren't the *cost* of the test itself.
* **C: Bapuce oyo ekoki kobeta mikanda** (Chips that can print documents) - This is too vague and doesn't relate to the specific cost mentioned.
* **D: Bisaleli mosusu ya koluka maladi** (Other ways to detect diseases) - The passage is specifically about *this* new test and its cost, not other methods.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, maloba nini oyo elobeli biteni ya libende ya lobate ezali solo te?","The correct answer is **B: Kozala na bango elakisi ete sanza ezangi mosala ya mabele te**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bamonaki bisika ya bongo na bisika mingi na sanza pe emonani ete ebeba mingi te, yango emonisi ete makambo oyo esalaki ete esalema, esalemaki kala te.""  This translates to: ""They observed structures of the earth and many structures in the universe and realized it wasn't abundant, which showed that the things that happened were not going to last, weren't lasting.""  This implies a belief that the universe *isn't* created through simple chance or easily reproducible events (""mosala ya mabele"" - easy work/simple creation).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mbala mosusu makambo oyo ekelaki bango esalemaki kala mingi te:**  This translates to ""Another time, the things that happened to them didn't last long.""  While true based on the passage, it doesn't directly address the question of *why* they believed the universe wasn't created randomly.
* **C: Ekoki kozala mbuma ya kokita ya sanza:** This translates to ""It could be a mystery of the universe."" This is too vague and doesn’t reflect the specific reasoning mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Ezalaki na yango mingi te oyo ezwamaki na likoló ya sanza:** This translates to ""There wasn't much in it that was reflected in the history of the universe.""  This is also a true statement implied by the passage, but not the core belief the question asks about.



Therefore, option B best captures the scientists' conclusion based on their observations – a belief that the universe's creation wasn’t a simple, random process."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, liteya nini na ntina na lolenge ya mabelé emonisi ete ezali na mosala ya géologie oyo ezali kosalema na sanza?","The correct answer is **B: Ndenge ya mabele esalemaki kala mingi te** (The way things decayed didn't happen much).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P)** states that scientists found evidence of ancient life (fossils) in the ice, and that this life *didn't* decay as much as expected. They found a lot of well-preserved remains, suggesting a slow or arrested decay process. This challenges the idea that the ice has been melting and refreezing for a long geological period, as extensive melting/refreezing *would* lead to more decay.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sanza ezali kokita mokemoke** (The ice is very old) - The passage doesn't directly state the ice is old, only that evidence *within* it suggests something unusual about its history.
* **C: Ezali kaka na mwa ndambo moke ya biloko oyo ezali na likoló ya sanza** (It's only within a single layer of things within the ice) - The passage speaks of multiple findings, not just a single layer.
* **D: Ndenge yam abele esalamaki kala mingi te** (The way animals decayed didn't happen much) - While related, this is less precise than option B. Option B specifically addresses *how* decay happened (or didn't) and directly relates to the geological process of melting/refreezing.



Therefore, option B best reflects the central point made in the passage - the surprisingly well-preserved state of the fossils indicates something unusual about the ice's history and challenges the assumption of extensive geological activity."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekozala mingi te ya kino na bofundami?","The correct answer is **B: Mikanda oyo ebimisaka ba foto** (Records that show the photos).

Here's why:

The passage discusses concerns about potentially harmful photos of children being shared during the Edinburgh lessons. The core of the issue revolves around *what* photos were being shown and the potential negative impact.  The authorities are asking for a re-examination of the lessons, specifically focusing on the photos used.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ba commentaires mosusu** (Other comments) - While comments might be relevant, the central concern isn't *what people said* about the photos, but the photos themselves.
* **C: Masolo ya bilembeteli ya ba témoins miso** (Testimonies of witnesses) - Witness testimonies would be about what happened, but the focus is on the visual evidence.
* **D: Mikanda ya masolo** (Records of incidents) - This is too broad. The specific incident is the showing of potentially harmful photos.



The passage specifically states the need to review *what* was shown (the photos) to ensure the safety of the children. Therefore, records of the photos are the most directly related to preventing future issues."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ezali mokakatano ya lelo te mpo na batu oyo batyaka bilembo?","The correct answer is **A: Ndenge ya mopepe ya makasi** (The way of intense heat).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Longola baglace oyo esanganaka esika moko, makambo mabe ya mopepe ebebisi makasi mosala ya kobikisa bato."" This translates to ""A glacial melt occurred in one place, intense heat caused severe problems displacing people.""
* **The question asks:** What is the current concern for those seeking refuge?
* **Option A** directly addresses the cause of the displacement – the intense heat.  The people are seeking refuge *because* of the intense heat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Motango ya glace (The amount of ice):** While the passage mentions a large amount of ice, it's the *melting* due to heat that's the problem, not the quantity of ice itself.
* **C: Monene ya glace (The size of the ice):** Similar to B, size isn't the core issue.
* **D: Glace oyo ezali konyangwa (The melting ice):** This is a *result* of the problem, not the problem itself.  The concern isn't just that the ice is melting, but *why* it's melting and the consequences.



"
"Longola glace, nini mosusu ezali kotungisa milende ya kobikisa bato?","The correct answer is **A: Kozanga biloko ya kopesa** (Offering discounts).

Here's why:

The passage states the ice cream shop is using ""bad things of the competition"" to attract customers. This implies they are likely offering lower prices or deals (discounts) to draw people in. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ezalela ya météo (Weather forecasts):** While weather *can* influence ice cream sales, the passage specifically points to actions the shop is *taking* to attract customers, not external factors.
* **C: Kozanga lisalisi (Offering advertising):** The passage doesn't mention advertising.
* **D: Bato oyo bakangamaka (People who are fighting):** This is nonsensical in the context of attracting customers.



"
bindimeli nini Roberts aboyaki kondimisa yango?,"The correct answer is **C: Ebandeli ya bomoi** (The beginning of life).

Here's why:

The passage states Roberts believes Roe v. Wade was a ""**mobeko batia na ekolo**"" (a constitutional error) and ""amonisi ntina ya bikateli malamu ya esambiselo monene"" (expressed concern about the broad right to privacy).  He's questioning *when* life begins, which directly ties into the debate surrounding abortion and Roe v. Wade.  The question ""ntango nini"" (when) in the initial sentence refers to the timing of when life begins.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ethicalité ya kolobela makambo** (The ethics of decision-making) - While ethics are involved, the core of his argument revolves around *when* life starts, not the general ethics of making decisions.
*   **B: Ntina ya bikateli ya tribunal ya likolo oyo ezali ntango nyonso** (The constitutional authority of the Supreme Court at all times) - This is a broader topic that Roberts touches on, but the immediate focus is on the substance of the Roe v. Wade ruling.
*   **D: Makoki ya kozala na bomoi ya motu ye moko** (The right to life of an individual) - While related, the core issue Roberts is questioning is *when* that right to life begins, not the existence of the right itself.



"
Likambo nini Roberts amonaki ete ezalaki na bizaleli malamu te mpo na kolobela yango?,"The correct answer is **B: Mokano ya Roe v. Wade**.

Here's why:

The passage states Roberts ""azongelaki makambo alobaki liboso ete Roe v. Wade ezalaki """"mobeko batia na ekolo"""", pe amonisi ntina ya bikateli malamu ya esambiselo monene.""  This directly translates to ""he reminded of what he had said before that Roe v. Wade was """"a historical precedent"""" and emphasized the importance of respecting settled law."" He believed respecting the precedent of Roe v. Wade was important for the court's legitimacy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Boyokani ya Mikano ya tribunal ya likolo:** While the court's practices are relevant, the passage specifically focuses on Roberts' view of *Roe v. Wade* itself, not just general court practices.
*   **C: Bokoki ya kozala na bomoi ya kobomba:** The passage mentions the end of abortion rights but doesn't state Roberts thought this was the problem for the court's legitimacy.
*   **D: Makambo ya sikisiki ya makambo:** This is too vague and doesn't align with the specific focus on Roe v. Wade's precedent.



"
Banzete mibale ya pole ezali kongenga wapi?,"The correct answer is **A: Epai ya likolo** (At the edge of the field).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Batie banzete mibale ya pole mpo etalaka na **likolo** na butu."" (They built a pole fence to demarcate on the **field** in the bush.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Na ngambo mosusu ya engumba** (On the other side of the city) - The text doesn't mention another side of the city.
* **C: Na esika ya kokoma ya jet ya liboso** (At the crash site of the plane) - While the text mentions a plane, it doesn't say the fence is *at* the crash site.
* **D: Na katikati ya parke ya bokundoli** (In the middle of the botanical garden) - The text refers to a field in the bush, not a botanical garden.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ntango nini bandako milai ya sika ezali kotongama na esika yango?","The correct answer is **A: Na katikati ya mokolo** (Midday/Noon).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...bazotonga bandako milai mitano ya sika na esika wana, esika ya kozwa transport mpe parke ya ekaniseli **ekozala na katikati**.""  This directly translates to ""...they planned to place five signs there, where the transport drop-off and church parking would be **in the middle**.""

Therefore, the signs were planned to be placed at midday/noon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: na 8:46 liboso ya zanga** (at 8:46 tomorrow morning) - The passage states 8:46 was when the silence *was*, not when the signs were put up.
* **C: Butu mobimba** (A long time) - The passage doesn't mention a long time; it focuses on a specific location and planning.
* **D: Botongi yango ezali kokoba** (That plan is false) - The passage presents the plan as happening, not as false.



"
Makambo nini emonisi ete Bandeko Sambo bazali mabulu?,"The correct answer is **B: Diamètre ya esika ya kokota namabulu** (Diameter of the crater area with boulders).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bisika nyonso ya kokota na libulu, oyo bapesaki nkombo """"Bandeko-Basi nsambo,"""" eza monene bametele pene ya 100 kino 250 (328 to 820 feet)."" This directly translates to ""All the craters on the moon, which they call """"Bandeko-Basi nsambo,"""" are large, measuring between 100 and 250 (328 to 820 feet).""  The size (diameter) of these craters is what indicates they are boulders/rock formations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bokeseni ya molunge** (State of the environment) - The passage mentions the environment briefly in relation to thermal activity, but it doesn't *prove* they are boulders.
*   **C: Boluki ya mabele** (Rock composition) - The passage mentions thermal properties related to rocks, but doesn't focus on *what* the rocks are made of, only their size and thermal signatures.
*   **D: Bililingi ya mabulu na Mabelé** (Relationship of boulders to Mabelé) - ""Mabelé"" is a specific area, and the passage doesn't directly link boulders *to* Mabelé in a way that defines them as boulders.



"
Ndenge nini bizaleli ya molunge ya Bandeko basi Sambo emonanaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Bililingi ya infrarouge** (Infrared imaging).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""**Bilili ya infrarouges ezomonisa bambongwana ya temperature na kati ya butu pe moi, emonisi ete mbala mosusu eza libulu.**"" (Infrared imaging shows temperature differences in the soil and moisture, indicating that there is another crater.)

This directly links infrared imaging to the discovery and understanding of the Bandeko-Basi nsambo craters. The other options are mentioned *as features of* the craters, but infrared imaging is the *method* used to identify them.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mabulu ya mozindo na mabele** (Crater rims on the ground) - While the passage describes crater rims, it doesn't say this is *how* they were identified.
*   **C: Diamètre ya mabulu** (Crater diameter) - The passage mentions diameter as a measurement (100-250 kino), but not as the method of discovery.
*   **D: Bolukiluki ya mabulu oyo ezali na Mabelé** (Location of craters in Mabele) - This is a description of where they are, not how they were found."
"Kolandana na bokomi, maloba nini nan tina na motu bazokanisa ezali ya solo te?","The correct answer is **B: Balobaki ete abwakaki explosif moko** (They said he carried an explosive device).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...moto oyo bakanisi ete abwakaki bombe..."" which directly translates to ""...the person they suspected carried a bomb...""
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Asalelaki motuka moko na ntango ya kobundisa ye** (He stole a car at the time of his arrest) - The passage doesn't mention car theft.
    * **C: Ekolo na ye eyebani na bakonzi** (His nationality was known by investigators) - The passage explicitly says his nationality *wasn't* known by investigators (""nkombo na ye eyebani kaka te na bakonzi"").
    * **D: Azokaki te** (He didn't escape) -  The passage states he was caught *after* potentially setting off the bomb (""nsima ya kozoka na bombe wana"").



"
Nsango nini etali kobunda bakonzi bandimisi?,"The correct answer is **D: Nkombo ya liboso mpe ya nsuka ya moto oyo bafundaki** (The past and current identity of the person they are investigating).

Here's why:

* **The passage states the investigators are focused on the person's background, specifically that they believe he is a Uighur.** This suggests they are trying to understand his identity – who he *was* (liboso) and who he *is* now (nsuka) – to connect him to the bombing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nsango na ntina na basangani nionso** (The crime and all its details) - While the crime is important, the passage focuses on *who* they think committed it, not just the crime itself.
* **B: Ekolo ya motu bazokanisa** (The place the suspect comes from) - While his origin (Uighur ethnicity) is mentioned, it's about *who he is* not just *where he's from*.
* **C: Ntina oyo ezali nsima ya kobunda** (The thing that happened after the bombing) - The passage mentions his arrest *after* the bombing, but the core of the investigation is his identity.



"
Ekipe nini ekobeta na match na Ellis Park?,"The correct answer is **C: Afrique ya Sud mpe Australie**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ntango Springboks ekobeta na Australie."" (when the Springboks will play against Australia).  ""Springboks"" is the nickname for the South African rugby team, and ""Australie"" is Australia.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: All Blacks nionso Australie** - The text doesn't say the All Blacks are playing.
* **B: Nouvelle-Zélande mpe Afrika ya Sudi** - While the previous match was against New Zealand, this question asks about the match at Ellis Park.
* **D: Springboks na All Blacks** - The text specifically states Springboks will play Australia, not the All Blacks.



"
Springboks ekobeta lisano na bango ya nsima wapi?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Match ya suka ya eleko wana ekobetama na Ellis Park na Johannesburg na poso ezoya, ntango Springboks ekobeta na Australie."" This directly translates to: ""The next match of the series will be played at Ellis Park in Johannesburg next time, when Springboks will play against Australia.""

Therefore, Springboks will play their next match in Johannesburg.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi esika nini ezwaki mokakatano na yango na boumeli ya mosala?","The correct answer is **B: Kobatela gyroscope**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that a gyroscope is being installed on the station to help with orientation in space (preventing it from spinning uncontrollably). The problem focuses on *what* is being installed as a solution to a problem with the station's orientation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kobatela bosika oyo ekoki na masini ya kopusa:** (Installing a device that can be used with a machine) - Too vague and doesn't relate directly to the problem described.
* **C: Kotia Jet na mosala:** (Adding a jet to the station) - While jets *could* be used for orientation, the passage specifically mentions a gyroscope.
* **D: Kozongela ezaleli ya malamu:** (Improving the condition of the well) - Completely irrelevant to the context of a space station.



"
"Kolandana na bokomi, mokano ya saba ya esika ya mosala ezalaki nini?","The correct answer is **A: Kozwa gyroscope oyo ebungaki** (Fixing the broken gyroscope).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""atako babungisaki gyroscope moko na ebandeli na mosala moko ya kokende likolo..."" (they were fixing a gyroscope at the beginning of a module that was rotating).  This clearly indicates the primary problem and initial action.
* The rest of the passage details consequences *of* the gyroscope issue (instability, needing funding) but doesn't state they were initially focused on those things.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kopusana penepene na bamasini ya kopusa ya kobongwana:** (Dealing closely with the control machines for rotation) - While related to the issue, it's not the *initial* problem they were addressing.
* **C: Kosilisa esika ya kotambola:** (Simplifying the rotation area) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Kotia bajet na mosala:** (Allocating a budget to the module) - This is a *result* of the problem, not the initial task.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, , oyo wapi ezali ya solo te?","The correct answer is **A: Efundamaki na ekolo esika wapi AOL ezali na biro munene** (It happened in the country where AOL was headquartered).

Here's why:

* **The passage states AOL *founded* the case.** This implies the legal action took place where AOL had a significant presence – its headquarters.  The question asks where the event (the case) happened.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Etumbu emekamaki** (The lawsuit was filed) - While true, it doesn't answer *where* it happened.
    * **C: Mibeko oyo etali email ya spam esalelamaki na likambo yango** (The rules concerned spam emails used in the case) - This describes *what* the case was about, not *where* it happened.
    * **D: Bazalaki kofunda AOL** (They were suing AOL) - Again, this describes *who* was involved, not the location.

The passage directly links the event to AOL, and logically, a company's legal battles are usually centered around its base of operations.



"
"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi elobeli likambo yango na bosikisiki?","The correct answer is **A: AOL afundamaki mpo na kokabola biloko oyo basɛngaki te** (AOL founded to combat things they didn't like).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""kompani oyo efundaki makambo wana"" - ""the company founded those things"" referring to the fight against spam. The passage explicitly states AOL *started* this effort.
* **The passage then clarifies:** the fight was against unwanted electronic messages (spam) to prevent people from being bothered. This implies they were actively trying to *stop* something they didn't approve of.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Likambo yango etali ba fournisseurs mibale ya liboso ya mosala ya internet** (The event involved several early internet service providers) - The passage focuses *specifically* on AOL.
* **C: Likambo yango etalemaki na 2003** (The event took place in 2003) - 2003 is mentioned as a point *before* action was taken, not when the founding occurred.
* **D: AOL nde ebandaki kofunda likambo yango** (AOL didn't start that event) - This is directly contradicted by the passage.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, club nini Vidal abandaki kobeta mpo bitelo misato eleki?","The correct answer is **A: Seville**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...autaki na Seville."" (and went to Seville). It directly says Vidal went to Seville *after* leaving Barça.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Catalan** - Catalan refers to the region, not a club.
*   **C: Barça** - The passage says he *left* Barça, he didn't continue playing for them.
*   **D: Capital** - This is not mentioned in the text.



"
Vidal asali masano boni na Barça?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The text states: ""Vidal abeta match 49 mpona ekipe wana."" (Vidal played 49 matches for that team.) 

Therefore, Vidal played 49 matches for Barça."
Ekipe nini ebetaki na bango na masano wana?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

Here's why:

The text states ""match oyo bakobeta na Bologne"" (the match they played against Bologna) and ""match balingaki kobeta mokolo ya Lomingo contre Bologne"" (the match they will play on Sunday against Bologna).  This clearly indicates Bologna is the team they are playing against.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jarque** - Jarque is a person (the player who died), not a team.
*   **C: Coverciano** - Coverciano is a place (a training center in Italy).
*   **D: italie** - Italie is a country.



"
Mpo na nini Jarque azalaki kofanda na otele yango?,"The correct answer is **B: Azalaki na likita ya liboso ya eleko** (He was preparing for tomorrow's training session).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Azalaki kofanda na hotel ya ekipe na bango liboso ya match oyo bakobeta na Bologne na mokolo ya Lomingo."" and ""Azalaki kofanda na hotel ya ekipe liboso ya match balingaki kobeta mokolo ya Lomingo contre Bologne."" This means he was resting at the hotel *before* the match against Bologna on Sunday and *preparing for* the match they will play on Sunday against Bologna.  ""Liboso"" in this context means preparation or getting ready.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Azalaki na momeseno (He was resting)** - While resting is *part* of preparation, the text focuses on preparing for the *match*, not just resting.
* **C: Azalaki na match moko dimanche (He had a match on Sunday)** - He *plays* a match on Sunday, but being at the hotel is about preparing for it.
* **D: Azalaki kosala momeseno na Bolonia (He was resting in Bologna)** - The text doesn't say he was in Bologna, just that he was preparing for a match *against* Bologna.



"
Mpo na nini biro ya géophysique ya Jakarta ekopesa likebisi te?,"The correct answer is **D: Ekokisaki te bonene oyo esengelaki mpo na koningana ya mabele** (It didn't reach the magnitude needed to trigger an alert).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Likebisi moko te ya tsunami ekopesama mpo koningana moko te ekokisaki masengami ya 6,5."" (No tsunami warning was issued because the earthquake didn't reach a magnitude of 6.5.)
* This directly explains why the geophysics bureau of Jakarta didn't issue a warning - the earthquake was too small.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Likama ya tsunami ezalaki te** (There was no tsunami) - While true, this doesn't explain *why* the bureau didn't issue a warning.  They wouldn't know there was no tsunami *until* they analyzed the earthquake.
* **B: Mpo na koboya panique kati na bavandi** (To avoid panic among the population) - While avoiding panic is a concern, it's not the primary reason for not issuing a warning; accuracy is more important.
* **C: Mpo na koboya oyo ekosala na baentreprise ya mboka** (To avoid disruption to national businesses) - This is not a valid reason for a geophysics bureau to withhold a tsunami warning.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki,  koningana ya mabele yango esalaki nini?","The correct answer is **B: Likama ya tsunami** (The possibility of a tsunami).

Here's why:

The passage states that despite there being no tsunami warning, people *felt* the earthquake and were scared, and fled to higher ground. This indicates they were fearing a tsunami. The question asks what the concern was based on the information given.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bato ya mboka oyo babangaki (People of the city who were scared)** - While true, this is a *result* of the concern, not the concern itself.
* **C: Likebisi oyo ebimisami (The earthquake that was felt)** - The earthquake happened, but the question asks about what people were worried *about* because of it.
* **D: 6,5 na échelle ya bonene (6.5 on the Richter scale)** - This is just the magnitude of the earthquake; it doesn't explain what the fear was.



"
"Na kati ya minzoto yango, oyo wapi etindaka moi mpe minzoto mosusu nyonso esalaka mosala?","The correct answer is **D: Kongenga, motango ya Rossby, mpe kobalukabaluka**.

Here's why:

* **Kongenga (Convection):** The passage states the process starts with convection.
* **Motango ya Rossby (Rossby waves):** The passage explicitly links the convective process to the formation and behavior of Rossby waves.  A strong Rossby wave is key to the magnetic reconnection.
* **Kobalukabaluka (Reconnection):** The passage states magnetic reconnection occurs *because* of the Rossby wave, and is the final result of the process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kongenga mpe koleka ya plasma:** While plasma is involved, ""koleka"" (confinement) isn't a direct step outlined in the passage's explanation of the process.
* **B: Motango ya Rossy, kobalukabaluka, mpe kozonga ya ema:**  ""Kozonga ya ema"" (emission of energy) is a result of reconnection, but not a direct part of *how* it happens according to the passage. The order is also wrong.
* **C: Kobalukabaluka mpe kongenga:**  This reverses the order of the process as described in the passage; convection *leads to* reconnection, not the other way around.



"
Ndenge nini bayebaka motángo ya Rossby ya monzoto moko?,"The correct answer is **B: Motango ya kokita ya plasma** (Plasma instability).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...pole pe kobaluka, basalelaka yango elongo mpona koyeba motango ya minzoto Rossby, oyo eza na boyokani na plazma.""  This directly translates to ""...instability and turbulence, they relate it strongly to Rossby waves of the plasma.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kongenga mpe kobalukabaluka (Convection and turbulence):** While turbulence is mentioned, it's *related to* the Rossby waves, not how they are detected.
* **C: Nivo ya mosala (Level of activity):** This is too general and doesn't specifically address how Rossby waves are identified.
* **D: Motango ya kozonga ya ema (Electromagnetic radiation):**  While magnetic fields are involved, the passage doesn't mention detecting Rossby waves through electromagnetic radiation.



Therefore, the passage clearly links Rossby waves to the instability of plasma."
Bato boni na mokama oyo batunaki bango bazali kopesa maboko na Australie ekóma mbala moko république?,"The correct answer is **B: 29 %**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""bato 29 na kati ya mokama ya bato oyo bapesaki biyano bakanisi ete Australie esengeli kokoma repiblike kala mingi te...""  This translates to ""29 out of the total number of people surveyed indicated they did *not* think Australia should become a republic.""

The question asks how many supported Australia *not* becoming a republic, which is directly stated as 29%.



"
"Kolandana na Julie Gillard, ntango nini Australie esengeli kokoma république?","The correct answer is **B: Nsima ya boyangeli ya Mokonzi-mwasi Elizabeth II** (After the reign of Queen Elizabeth II).

The text states: ""Julia Gillard, première ministre oyo azosala intérim, alobaki na ntango ya kampanie ya maponi ya 2010 azalaki kokanisa ete Australie esengeli kokoma république na suka ya boyangeli ya mokonzi Elizabeth II.""  This translates to: ""Julia Gillard, the interim prime minister, stated during the 2010 election campaign that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.""



"
Ebongiseli nini ezali na bolukiluki ya mibeko?,"The correct answer is **D: Komite ya moke ya bokengeli mpe ya bolukiluki** (Committee for Oversight and Reform).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Stearns azoluka koyeba soki basalelaka bampako mpona kopekisa mbongo ya kosopa zemi na nzela ya ebongiseli Planned Parenthood oyo eza na mokumba ya molandi ya president na komite moke ya kokengela pe kolandela..."" This clearly indicates that a committee overseeing and investigating is involved in the situation.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Komite ya Molunge mpe Nkita ya ndako ya maponami** - This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **B: Komen Fondation** - Komen is the organization *under* scrutiny, not the investigating body.
* **C: Boboti oyo ekanamaki** - This phrase doesn't translate to anything relevant to the context and isn't mentioned.



"
Cliff Stearns azali mokambi ya komite nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Komite ya moke ya bokengeli mpe ya bolukiluki** (Committee of Oversight and Government Reform).

The passage states: ""Stearns azoluka koyeba soki basalelaka bampako mpona kopekisa mbongo ya kosopa zemi na nzela ya ebongiseli Planned Parenthood oyo eza na mokumba ya molandi ya president na komite moke ya kokengela pe kolandela, oyo eza na se ya komite ya nguya pe ya mbongo ya Chambre."" This translates to ""Stearns will look to see if they are illegally using funds to support the Planned Parenthood organization within the president's jurisdiction in a committee of oversight and government reform, which is the successor to the committee of government and finance of the Chamber.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Komite ya Molunge mpe Nkita ya ndako ya maponami:** This doesn't appear in the text.
*   **B: Komen Fondation:** Komen is the foundation being investigated, not Stearns' committee.
*   **C: Boboti oyo ekanamaki:** This is irrelevant to the text.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekomelaki mwasi yango ya Suisse te?","The correct answer is **C: Basangisaki ye nzoto na makasi na bato 5** (They sexually assaulted her with 5 people).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Tokangi bato mitano oyo basangisaki nzoto na makasi na mwana-mwasi ya Swisse"" - which translates to ""Arrest the five people who sexually assaulted the Swiss woman.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bazwaki biloko na ye oyo bayibaki** (They confiscated her belongings) - While belongings *were* taken, this isn't the primary harm she suffered.
* **B: Babomaki ye** (They killed her) - The text does *not* mention she was killed.
* **D: Bayibaki telefone na ye mpe ordinatɛrɛ na ye ya moke** (They took her phone and computer) - This is a detail, but not the core of what happened *to* her.



"
Société nini ezwaki mbano ya Taïwan Sustainable Award na 2007?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The text explicitly states: ""bazando ya koteka baordinatere ya maboko ekokesena pe ekobongwana makasi ndenge Yuan mokonzi ya ekolo Chine apesi ASUS libonza na mbano ya Taiwan Sustainable Award ya 2007.""  This translates to: ""...and thanks to the development of portable and powerful computers like the Chinese environmentalist Yuan, ASUS won the Taiwan Sustainable Award in 2007.""
"
PC ASUS Eee ezali nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Ordinatere**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states ""ASUS Eee PC"" and describes it being presented at a computer show (""Taipei IT Month"") and winning an award related to computers (""baordinatere ya maboko"").  It is clearly a type of computer, specifically a small, portable one.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Smartphone moko** - The text doesn't mention phone capabilities.
* **C: Tablette moko** - While it's a portable device, the description leans more towards a traditional computer form factor.
* **D: Mobombami** - This isn't a recognized type of device and doesn't fit the description.



"
Nani azalaki na mokumba ya mikanda ya poste oyo ebungaki ?,"The correct answer is **C: Mwana mobali moko** (A single man).

Here's why:

The passage states ""ete mwana-mobali abombaki mikanda ya poste koleka 600, ata pe mikanda 429 ya Mbula ya Sika..."" (and a man collected over 600 letters, including 429 from the New Year, which he didn't give to his parents).  This directly identifies a single man as the one accumulating the letters.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Basali ya poste** (Post office employees) - While involved in the process, they aren't the ones *collecting* the letters.
* **B: Etuluku moko ya bafandi ya Obanazawa** (A group of Obanazawa students) - The passage focuses on one individual, not a group.
* **D: Mediaédia** (Media) - The media isn't mentioned as collecting the letters.



"
"Kolandana na bokomi, nani abimisaki mokanda ya kosenga bolimbisi mpo na mikanda oyo ebungaki?","The correct answer is **B: Mwana mobali**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ete mwana-mobali abombaki mikanda ya poste koleka 600, ata pe mikanda 429 ya Mbula ya Sika, oyo bapesaki yango te na bakolo na yango.""  This translates to ""and a young man collected over 600 postal items, including 429 from the Golden Week, which he did not give to his parents.""  

Therefore, the young man is the one who collected the items and is asking for help with them (implicitly, by needing the post office to process them).  The question asks who *submitted* the request for assistance with the letters.



"
Tango nini Del Potro asengelaki kotalela likambo na ye ya lipeka?,"The correct answer is **C: Ntango ya eteni ya mibale**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Basalisaki Potro na lipeka banda na ngonga wana kasi azongelaki match na ye."" which translates to ""Potro started the tie-break and won the match.""  A tie-break happens *during* the final set when the score reaches 6-6.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Na boumeli ya eteni ya liboso:** (At the beginning of the first set) - The passage discusses the final set, not the first.
* **B: Liboso ya kopema ya yambo:** (The beginning of the first game) - Same as above, irrelevant to the final set tie-break.
* **D: Nsima ya kopema ya misato:** (The end of the third game) -  Doesn't relate to the context of winning a match with a tie-break.



"
Oyo euti na kopema ya liboso liboso ezalaki nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Ebungaki na Del Potro nsima na kozoka na ye** (Del Potro won after coming back from behind).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Del Potro was losing at the beginning of the tie-break, but he needed to win several points to tie it at 6-6. This clearly indicates he *came back* to equalize and then win the match.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ebungaki na Murray na eteni ya yambo** (Murray won at the beginning) - The passage says the *opposite* - Del Potro was losing at the start of the tie-break.
* **C: Elongamaki na Murray na eteni ya mibale** (Murray dominated in the tie-break) - The passage describes Del Potro making a comeback, not Murray dominating.
* **D: Elongamaki na Del Potro na eteni ya mibale** (Del Potro dominated in the tie-break) -  While Del Potro *won* the tie-break, the passage emphasizes he had to fight back from behind, not dominate.



"
"Ndenge elobami na bokomi, nani, mpenza mpenza, akutanaki na mobɛli moko?","The correct answer is **D: Bana ya mboka** (Children/Students).

Here's why:

The text (P) states: ""Guvernere alobaki lisusu ete, """"Lelo, toyebi ete **bana-kelasi mosusu ya biteyelo ya bana bakutanaki na moto moko ya maladi.**"""" "" 

This translates to: ""The Governor also said, 'Today, we know that **other students in school are connected to one person with a disease.**'""

Therefore, it's the students (bana ya mboka) who are connected to the person with the illness.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki,  endimiseli nini gouverneur apesaki te ntango azalaki koloba na bana mboka ya Texas?","The correct answer is **A: Ebongiseli yango ezali kosala malamu** (That assistance is working well).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ndima ete ebongiseli na biso ezosala malamu ndenge esengeli."" (I hope that our assistance is working as well as it should.)  This directly indicates the governor hopes the aid is functioning correctly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Makambo mazali kosalema mpo na kobatela bokengi ya bato banso** (Things are being done to prevent the spread of disease to others) - While preventing spread is a *goal*, the governor doesn't explicitly state things *are* being done for prevention in this quote.
* **C: Bazali na bisaleli mpo na kolonga mokakatano yango** (They have the resources to fight the crisis) - The passage doesn’t mention resources.
* **D: Likambo yango ezali monene te** (The situation isn't serious) - The governor explicitly says, ""Likambo oyo eza ya monene"" (This situation is serious).



"
Esika nini ya parodie ya nsango esalemaki na bayekoli bale ya kala ya UW?,"The correct answer is **A: Raport ya Colbert (The Colbert Report)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""Liboso mpenza Daily Show na **Colbert Report**..."". It details how they, along with others, created a book satirizing university life while students at UW in 1988.  The passage then connects this to *The Onion*, implying a lineage of satirical reporting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kelasi ya maponami (Class of punishments):** While the text references students and potential pranks, it doesn’t focus on punishments as a parody itself.
* **C: Emission ya mokolo na mokolo (Daily show):** The Daily Show is mentioned alongside the Colbert Report, but the text focuses on the earlier work that *led* to those shows, not the shows themselves as the parody.
* **D: Litungulu (Dreams):** This doesn't relate to the information provided in the passage.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini na oyo elandi ezali te na kati ya bokonzi ya ","The correct answer is **A: Atlas ya mokili mobimba** (Atlas of a large map).

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""babimisaki karte ya mokili mobimba oyo babengi Mokili na biso ya bozoba"" which translates to ""they were falsifying a large map that they called Our Future Map."" This directly points to a large map (an atlas) being part of the prank.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Film moko** (A film) - While they did reporting-like activities, the primary focus isn't on creating a film.
* **C: Site internet** (A website) - The website is mentioned as a *result* of the prank (having 5 million hits), not the prank itself.
* **D: Mashine ya koniata mikanda** (Printing press) -  The printing press is a *tool* used to create materials for the prank, but not the core element.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ezalaki kokɛngɛla na polisi?","The correct answer is **C: Esika ya kokota na balabala Downing** (The area around Downing Street).

Here's why:

The text states the police were preparing to control the area around Downing Street where the Prime Minister's office is located *before* the protestors even started moving.  The entire passage details the police response to protestors *approaching* Downing Street. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Trafalgar Square:** The protestors *ended up* in Trafalgar Square, but that wasn't the initial concern for the police.
*   **B: Forum ya Printemps (Spring Forum):** This is where the Conservative party event was held, but the police were focused on controlling access to Downing Street, not necessarily the forum itself.
*   **D: Hoteli Grand Connaught Rooms:**  Similar to B, this is the location of the event, not the area the police were initially preparing to secure.



"
Na ngonga nini bapolisi basengaki na bato oyo bazalaki kosala mobulu ete bakende kofanda esika mosusu mpo mituka ekoma mingi lisusu te?,"The correct answer is **D: Na 11:20**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Na 11:20, polisi esengaki batomboki bazonga na nzela, eyebisaki bango ete ata baza na lotomo ya kotomboka basengeli kokanga bato nzela ya kotambola te.""  This directly translates to ""At 11:20, police asked protesters to leave the road, warning them that even if they were about to start, they shouldn't let people pass.""

This is the moment the police actively intervened to *prevent further disruption* by asking the protesters to move, thereby attempting to control the situation and minimize further issues. The other options refer to times before or after this specific instruction and action by the police.



"
Nini ezali solo mpo na bolukiluki oyo monganga Ehud Ur asalaki?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba résultats ekoki kozala na litomba mpo na ba malades oyo bazalaki na diabète Type 1 oyo bazalaki liboso.**

Here's why:

The passage states that Dr. Ehud Ur believes the research is only in its early stages, but could potentially be *helpful for people who previously had Type 1 diabetes*. This aligns directly with option A, which translates to ""The results could be useful for patients who previously had Type 1 diabetes.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage doesn't focus on people *without* diabetes getting it. It's about those who *had* it.
* **C:** Dr. Ur states the research is early and doesn't claim the observed effects will necessarily cure anything.
* **D:** The passage focuses on those *with* a history of diabetes, not those *without* it.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, monganga Ur azali na ntembe mpo na nini?","The correct answer is **A: Soki makambo oyo bamoni ezali na ntina mpo na bato oyo bazali na diabète ya Type 1**.

Here's why:

The passage states Dr. Ur believes the research is *only* relevant to the beginning stages and that other young people don't need to worry about preventing diabetes, specifically mentioning it doesn't apply to those with **Type 1 diabetes**.  He's concerned about whether the findings are helpful for people *already* diagnosed with Type 1.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Soki nkisi ekoki kosalema** - The passage doesn't focus on a cure.
* **C: Makanisi ya bato mosusu ya mayele na oyo etali nkisi moko** -  He says other young people don't need to worry about *getting* diabetes.
* **D: Soki ba mpuku oyo bazali na diabète te bakotikala bongo** - The passage doesn't discuss mortality rates.

"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola malamu te likama ya Vol CG4684?","The correct answer is **A: Na ebandeli mpepo yango ekokaki te kokita mpo na météo.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mopepe mabe oyo esalaki ete mpepo ekwea te yango mpe ezokanga bolukiluki nzela po esalama te."" This translates to ""The bad weather conditions stated that the wind couldn't fly there and would block the path so it wouldn't be safe.""  This directly implies the initial weather conditions prevented safe flight.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mpepo yango ekweaki na esika moko mosika mpenza:** The text doesn't say the wind only blew in one place.
* **C: Mpepo yango emekaki kokita mbala misato liboso ekwea:**  The text focuses on the *inability* to fly due to weather, not a count of times the wind blew.
* **D: Bolukiluki ya esika oyo mpepo ekweaki esimbamaki mpo na météo:** While the passage mentions blocked paths, it says this *because* the wind couldn't fly, not that the path was inherently blocked. The wind *created* the blockage.



"
Nini esalaki ete Vol CG4684 elongola kokita na yango?,"The correct answer is **D: Mopepe ezalaki mabe**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Mopepe mabe oyo esalaki ete mpepo ekwea te yango mpe ezokanga bolukiluki nzela po esalama te."" (The bad weather meant the plane couldn't fly and blocked the path so it couldn't land safely.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Esika oyo bazalaki kokita ezalaki esika oyo bato bakoki kokota te** - While the landing spot might have been difficult, the primary issue described is the *weather* preventing a safe landing.
* **B: Ezalaki na mpepo misusu ebele liboso ya CG4684** - The passage doesn't mention other planes being affected. It focuses on this specific flight.
* **C: Bazongisaki nzela ya mpepɔ yango na Kokoda** - The passage doesn't say anything about changing the flight path *because* of the weather in Kokoda.



"
"Na kotalela bokomi, na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi oyo elobeli likambo oyo Franciszek Kowal akutanaki na yango ezali solo?","The correct answer is **C: Abukaki kiti moko ntango azalaki koluka kobima.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bato bazalaki kobeta bakiti na batalatala, kasi bafenetre wana epasukaka te."" (People were hitting windows with sticks, but the windows didn't break.)  And then, ""Sukasuka talatala moko epasukaki, mpe babandaki kobima na fenentre"" (Eventually one stick broke, and they kept hitting the window.) This clearly indicates someone *broke a stick* while trying to break the window.  Franciszek Kowal is described as the one who did this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Alongaki kobuka lininisa moko** - The passage doesn't mention anything about trying to open a door.
* **B: Nsukansuka, azwaki mpasi te** - While the attempt to break the window was likely frustrating, the passage doesn't focus on his emotional state. It focuses on the *physical* act of breaking a stick.
* **D: Azokaki ntango azalaki koluka kobuka lininisa** - Again, there's no mention of trying to open a door.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the text."
Mpo na nini ezali mpasi mpo na koyeba bopusi oyo mopepe makasi Danielle ekoki kobimisa?,"The correct answer is **C: Mopepe yango ezali mosika na kokóma na mabele.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lokola mopepe makasi ezalaki mosika ya kokoma na mabele, eza mpasi na koyeba mabe ekoki kosala na Etats-Unis to na Caraïbes."" (Because the hurricane is likely to move westward, it is difficult to know what damage it could cause in the United States or the Caribbean.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage mentions Danielle *could* become a major hurricane, it doesn't explain why it's difficult to predict the damage.
* **B:** The passage states scientists *are* tracking the hurricane.
* **D:** While Danielle is far from Miami, the passage's concern isn't specifically about Miami, but the broader potential impact on the US and Caribbean.



"
"Kolandana na bokomi, na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi oyo elobeli Mopɛpɛ makasi Danielle ezali solo te?","The correct answer is **B: Esalemaki na Mbu Atlantike**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states: ""Mopepe makasi, oyo eza pene ya 3 000 miles ya Miami, na Floride, aza na mipepe ezosila te ya 40 mph (64 kph). **Esalemi na este ya mbu ya Atlantique.**"" (The major hurricane, which is about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, is moving with winds of less than 40 mph (64 kph). **It is located in the east of the Atlantic Ocean.**)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Impact na yango na Caraïbes eyebani te:** The text says it's *too early* to tell if it will impact the Caribbean, not that it *won't*.
* **C: Ekokaki kobongwana mopepe makasi:**  The text states it *could* become a major hurricane, but doesn’t say it *is* one currently.
* **D: Ezali pene na kokita na mabele:** The text says it's moving *towards* the west, but doesn't say it's close to land.

"Kolandana na bokomi, nini balobaka ete esengeli kosalema na bokono liboso ya kobimisa bokono ya mokili mobimba?","The correct answer is **A: Esengeli kokoma oyo ebomaka mingi te** (We need to prevent it from spreading widely).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...maladi wana ekoboma lisusu bato mingi te liboso ekomona maladi ya mokili mobimba."" (This disease shouldn't spread to many people like it does with common flu.)
* **The question asks:** What should be done to prevent a larger outbreak?
* **Option A directly addresses this** by saying we need to prevent widespread transmission.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bilembeteli esengeli kotikala moke:** (Vaccines should remain the same) - The passage doesn't discuss vaccines.
* **C: Bato mingi basengeli kozwa maladi yango:** (Many people should get the disease) - This is the opposite of what the passage implies.
* **D: Bana basengeli komona bilembo:** (Children should be monitored for symptoms) - While monitoring is good, the passage focuses on *preventing* widespread infection, not just detecting it after it happens.



"
"Kolandana na bokomi, mopepe makasi ezalaki mosika boni na Fujian?","The text states the eye of Typhoon Morakot was ""pene ya bakilometele tuku nsambo pene ya etuka ya Chine ebengami Fujian"" – approximately 70 kilometers from the coast of China near Fujian.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 70 kilomètres**.
"
Nani apesaki George W. Bush mbote ntango akomaki na Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng mpe Lee Hsien Loong**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Molandi ya premier ministre ya Singapour, Wong Kan Seng, ayambaki ye mpe asololaki makambo etali nkita mpe terorizme na Premier ministre ya Singapour Lee Hsien Loong.""  This translates to ""The Singaporean prime minister, Wong Kan Seng, welcomed him and discussed regional security and terrorism with Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.""  

Therefore, both Wong Kan Seng and Lee Hsien Loong greeted (and met with) George W. Bush upon his arrival in Singapore.
"
Ntango nini président alobelaki na ntina na kotanda nkita na Asia?,"The correct answer is **D: Na boumeli ya mobembo na ye mobimba ya pɔsɔ mobimba na Asia**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""nsima ya mposo moko ya kokweya na maponi ya katikati, Bush ayebisaki bato ete azobanda kosala mombongo na Asie.""  This translates to ""After a working lunch with the leaders, Bush told people he would continue to travel in Asia.""  This directly links his statement about continuing travel to Asia with the visit to Singapore and the meetings held there.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ntango akomaki na Singapour** - While he *was* in Singapore, the text doesn't say he announced his plans *during* his arrival, but after a lunch.
* **B: Na Wong Kan Seng** - Wong Kan Seng welcomed him and discussed issues, but wasn't the moment he made the announcement.
* **C: Kolanda kobungisa maponami na ye ya katikati** - The ""working lunch"" was a setting *for* the announcement, not the announcement itself.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na kati ya makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali mokano ya guvɛrnema mobimba?","The correct answer is **A: Misolo ya mingi mingi na sanza ya misato ya mobu oyo** (Many taxes in the current monetary system).

Here's why:

* **The passage states the problem is rooted in the ""sanza ya misato ya mobu"" (current monetary system) leading to excessive taxation (""kobakisa komipesa ya boyangeli"").**  The government's role in a flawed monetary system resulting in high taxes is the core issue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Zua mituka 300 (Taking 300 mituka):** This is a consequence of the problem, not the root cause.
* **C: Zua mituka mosusu 1.300 (Taking another 1300 mituka):** Also a consequence, representing the total amount needed.
* **D: Kitisa ebele ya batu na mituka (Reducing the suffering of people with mituka):** This is a desired outcome, not the source of the problem.



Therefore, the government's involvement is in the *system* that causes the excessive taxation, making **A** the most accurate answer."
Guvernema esakolaki nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Bazali kokana kopesa mbongo mpo na kosala mituka mosusu 1.300**

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""...eto tokoma na mposa ya kosomba mituka 1 300 mpo bato baleka mingi te."" (…to reach a point where we have 1300 vehicles so people don’t travel too much.)
* This directly translates to the government wanting to fund the creation of an additional 1300 vehicles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  Focuses on *charriots* (carts) not vehicles and the initial 300, not the 1300.
* **B:**  Talks about solving a traffic jam, which isn't the main point of the text.
* **D:** Refers to a future situation, not something the government is actively doing *now*.

* **P's statement translates to:** ""Listen, 'It seems that things are getting harder and harder. However, increasing the level of the game doesn't mean every game will be difficult.'""

* **The core idea is about the *increasing difficulty* of something (likely a game or task).**  P acknowledges things are getting harder, but also points out not *every* instance will be hard, implying a varying level of difficulty.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Likama ezali lisusu te (The game is not repeated):**  The statement doesn't mention repetition.
* **C: Bazali kozela ete babundisa bango (They want to improve them):**  The statement focuses on difficulty, not improvement.
* **D: Mayele ya libateli endimi ete kobunda yango ekozala makasi (The feeling of responsibility suggests that giving up will be difficult):** While there's a sense of challenge, the statement isn't about feeling responsible or the difficulty of giving up. It's about the changing level of the challenge itself.



Therefore, **A** most accurately reflects the central theme of P's statement."
Liloba nini na ntina na kotemela ezali ya solo te?,"The correct answer is **C: Kotemela esengaki kolongwa ya CEP ya liboso.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Na sanza eleki etuluku moko elobaki ete liboso CEP alongwa mosala na kati ya bibongiseli bazwaki mpona komema mboka na maponi ya sika.""  This translates to: ""In the last electoral period, it remained that the new CEP would work within the framework of observers to ensure the country's security during the elections.""  This directly relates to the need for the CEP to *conduct* the elections.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Commission présidentielle ezalaki eyano na botelemeli boye:** While the presidential commission is mentioned, the passage doesn't focus on *its* role in the difficulties, but rather the difficulty of holding elections.
* **B: Mampo nampo nami oyo elekaki nde ebimisaki botelemeli yango:** This is a statement of personal feeling and isn't supported by the text.
* **D: Kotemela ezalaki ntango mosusu na mobulu:** This is true (the elections were delayed), but it doesn't answer the question of *what* needed to happen – the conduct of the elections by the CEP.



"
Nani apesaki likanisi ete CEP ya suka atika mosala?,"The correct answer is **A: Martelly**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Martelly alapaki ndayi na etuluku ya Kokamba Maponi ya ntango Moke (CEP) esalami na bato minei lobi."" This translates to ""Martelly ordered the extension of the Electoral Council (CEP) to satisfy public opinion.""  Later it mentions Martelly extended the CEP's mandate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bato oyo bazali kosala mobulu** (People who are working tirelessly) - The text doesn't state they requested the extension.
* **C: Commission présidentielle** (Presidential Commission) - This isn't mentioned as making the decision.
* **D: Basangani ya CEP bapesaki makanisi yango bango moko** (CEP members made that decision themselves) -  The text clearly indicates *Martelly* made the decision to extend the CEP.

"Kolandana na liyebisi, nini esungami te na USA Gymnastics nsima na komonisa mpasi basani ya Nassar?","The correct answer is **C: Mbongwana oyo esengeli na kati ya ebongiseli** (Transparency within the organization).

Here's why:

The passage states that USA Gymnastics needs to provide information on a questionnaire ""to better understand the extent of what happened with those Larry Nassar abused, and to have it in all its honesty and transparency.""  This directly relates to needing *mbongwana* (transparency) in their internal workings and investigations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kolongolama ya mokanda** (Document release) - While document release *might* be part of being transparent, the passage emphasizes the *truthfulness* and *completeness* of the information, not just releasing documents.
*   **B: Kosala bisika ya kofanda kozala na nguya** (Creating a system to prevent future occurrences) - This is a *result* of needing transparency, but not what they lacked initially.
*   **D: Koluka bonsomi** (Firing staff) - The passage doesn't mention staff terminations as a key issue; the problem is a lack of openness about the abuse.



"
"Kolandana na liyebisi, mokano monene ya Gimnastique ya USA mpe ya komite olympique ya Etats-Unis ezali nini mpo na kokende liboso?","The correct answer is **A: Kongenga mwinda na mabe ya Larry Nassar** (Addressing the harm caused by Larry Nassar).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Lisanga USA Gymnastics ezopesa makambo na ankete oyo ekoki kosalisa na ya koyeba malamu lolenge oyo koniokola wana oyo balimboli na molende nyonso na bato oyo Larry Nassar aniokolakai bango..."" (USA Gymnastics will provide information for an investigation to better understand the extent of the damage done to those abused by Larry Nassar...) This highlights a core purpose of the current actions - dealing with the aftermath of Nassar's abuse.
* **The passage also mentions:** The aim is to ensure a safe environment for athletes *because* of what happened with Nassar.  The reforms are a direct response to the failures that allowed Nassar to abuse athletes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kokoba kolongola mokanda (Covering up the document):** The passage discusses *transparency* and providing information, not concealment.
* **C: Kokoba kosala boluki ya sekele (Making financial profits):** The passage doesn't mention any financial motivations.
* **D: Kotombola esika ya libateli mpo na basani (Improving the working environment for success):** While improving the environment *is* a goal, it's presented as a *result* of addressing the Nassar abuse, not the primary motivation itself.



"
Masuwa ezalaki kokende wapi ntango likambo yango esalemaki? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

The text states: ""Masuwa ya bitumba ebengami Avenger oyo elongolaka babombe, ezalaki kokende na Puerto Princesa na Palawan."" This translates to ""The Avenger-class minesweeper that launched bombs was located in Puerto Princesa in Palawan.""

Therefore, the minesweeper was located in Palawan when the incident occurred.



"
Oyo ezali likambo ya solo te na oyo etali masuwa oyo balobeli na mokapo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ezali masuwa ya etumba ya mine** (It was a mine-sweeping vessel).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Masuwa ya bitumba ebengami Avenger oyo elongolaka babombe, ezalaki kokende na Puerto Princesa na Palawan."" This translates to ""The Avenger-class mine-sweeping vessel that clears bombs was docked in Puerto Princesa, Palawan.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ezalaki na nzela na yango mpo na kokende na Puerto Princesa:** (It was on its way to dock in Puerto Princesa) - The passage says it *was docked* there, not on its way.
* **B: Ezali na Palawan:** (It was in Palawan) - While true, it doesn't specify *what* it was.
* **D: Ezali kopesama mpo na Flotte ya Sambo ya Marine ya U.S:** (It was preparing for the U.S. Marine Fleet) - The passage doesn't mention preparation for a fleet.



"
Nani apesaki maloba maye matali basoda ya Etats-Unis?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

The text states: ""Na Lomingo eleki, President ya Etats-Unis **Donald Trump**, na maloba oyo sekretere na ye alobaki, alobaki ete basoda ya Etats-Unis bakolongwa na Syrie."" (Last Sunday, the President of the United States **Donald Trump**, through his secretary, announced that US soldiers were withdrawing from Syria.)

Therefore, Donald Trump is the one who made the statement about the US soldiers.



"
"Kolandana na liyebisi, mboka nini ezwaki mokumba ya kokengela babundi oyo bakangami?","The correct answer is **D: Turquie**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Turquie ezalaki pe na mokumba ya kobatela basoda ya Etat islamique oyo bakangaki..."" which translates to ""Turkey also had the mission of capturing the fighters, they say, that Europe wants to repatriate to their country.""

Therefore, Turkey was the country with the mission to capture the fighters.



"
Bato bakanisaka ete nini nde esalaki motuka yango ekwea?,"The correct answer is **A: Esika ya makasi** (Mechanical failure).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...bakanisi ete mbala mosusu eutaki na moto ya makasi."" which translates to ""...they believe another time it was due to mechanical failure.""  This directly indicates mechanical failure as the suspected cause of the accident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Moto ya banguna (Building fire):** The text doesn't mention a fire.
*   **C: Esika ya bangomba (Road conditions):** While road conditions are mentioned, they are not identified as the *cause* of the accident.
*   **D: Mopepe ya mabe (Bad weather):** Bad weather is mentioned as hindering investigation, not causing the accident.



"
Na lolenge nini ya mabele likámá yango esalemaki?,"The correct answer is **B: Makasi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""... bakanisi ete mbala mosusu eutaki na moto ya **makasi**."" ( ...they believe another accident happened due to a **truck**.)

Therefore, the accident happened because of a truck. The other options don't fit the context of the passage.

*   **Banguna** (Buildings) - Not mentioned as a cause of the accident.
*   **Lisanga ya boyokani** (Political conflict) - Not mentioned as a cause of the accident.
*   **Ezali na bangomba** (It is in the countryside) - Describes *where* the accident happened, not *why*.



"
Bakonzi bazali kolikya nini mpo na mpela yango?,"The correct answer is **D: Bisika mingi oyo banyama ya zamba efandaka** (Many fishing activities that saltwater animals do).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yango wana, lolenge mibale ya bambisi elimwa, mpe mibale mosusu ekomi na likama, ata mpe chevelu oyo ezalaki na kuki."" (This included many fish species, and other creatures lived in the lagoon, even eels that were in the river).  It also mentions the barrage was built to facilitate fishing for saltwater animals (""bisika ya kofanda na banyama"").
* **The passage also says:** the engineers believe they can increase the fish population (""ekokoka kobongisa bazelo oyo ebima kuta na liboso"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kozongisama ya ba barres ya sable** (The construction of sandbars) - The passage discusses a barrage *being built*, not sandbars forming.
* **B: Bokeli ya ba plages** (The formation of beaches) -  Beaches aren't the focus of the passage.
* **C: Motángo ya ba chubs ya humpback oyo ebakisami** (The migration of humpback chubs that are observed) - While there might be fish movement, the passage doesn't specifically mention humpback chubs or migration as the *reason* the engineers are working on the barrage.



"
"Na kati ya makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi botongi ya barrage esimbaki mpo na libela?","The correct answer is **A: Bisika zelo ekangama**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Eloko wana eza ntina mingi mpona kosala **bisika zelo ekangama** mpe mabongo, oyo ezalaki bisika ya kofanda na banyama.""  This directly links the construction of the barrage to the need for better fishing and hunting grounds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ba mbisi ya kovimba:** While the passage mentions animals, it doesn't say the barrage was built *by* them.
* **C: Bisika oyo banyama ya zamba bafandaka:** This refers to hunting grounds that *already existed*, not the reason for building the barrage.
* **D: Bopalangani ya zelo:**  This is too vague. The passage is specific about *why* the fishing/hunting needed improvement.



"
"Kolandana na bokomi, nani apesaki na mayele ya laibateli yaEtats-Unis oyo etali bibundi oyo ekoki kozala?","The correct answer is **A: Bato ya Somalie oyo balekisaka ndelo** (Somali refugees).

Here's why:

The passage states the US embassy warned about ""Somali fighters"" potentially attacking in Kenya and Ethiopia, coming from Somalia. This implies the concern is specifically regarding *people from Somalia* (refugees/fighters) being the source of the potential attacks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ambassade ya Éthiopie** (Ethiopian Embassy) - The passage talks about potential attacks *in* Ethiopia, not the embassy itself.
* **C: Esika oyo eyebani te** (An unidentified location) - The passage specifies Kenya and Ethiopia.
* **D: Esika moko na Kenya** (A location in Kenya) - While Kenya is mentioned, the warning is broader than just one location and focuses on the source of the threat (Somali fighters).



"
"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola ndenge ya kobunda ya botelemi ya?","The correct answer is **C: Kopanza babombe na bisika ya ntina na mikili mibale** (Bringing bombers to trouble spots and multiple countries).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The US embassy warns that ""Somali bombers"" are likely to attack in Kenya and Ethiopia, having already done so in Kenya. This clearly indicates a threat involving bombers operating in *multiple countries* (Kenya and Ethiopia) and targeting *trouble spots* (implied by the context of the threat).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kopanza babɔmbe na bisika ya ntina na mboka moko** (Bringing bombers to trouble spots in one country) - Incorrect because the threat is mentioned in two countries.
* **B: Kopanzana babombe na mikili mibale** (Bringing bombers to multiple countries) -  While true, it doesn't specify the *location* of those countries being trouble spots.
* **D: Kopanza ba bombe na mboka moko** (Bringing bombers to one country) - Incorrect because the threat is in two countries.



"
"Na kati ya bato oyo elandi, nani azali avocat te?","The correct answer is **A: Petros Mantouvalos**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Petros Mantouvalos, moto ya parlema mpe **avoka**..."" (Petros Mantouvalos, a parliament member and **lawyer**...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sakis Kechagioglou:** The text says he was arrested *with* an avocat, but doesn't state he *is* an avocat.
*   **C: George Nikolakopoulos:**  Similar to Sakis, he was arrested *with* avocats, but isn't identified as one himself.
*   **D: Makis Triantafylopoulos:** He is described as a journalist (""mopanzi-sango"") and doesn't have any mention of being an avocat.



"
Etuluku nini ya bato balobelami te ete bazali na kati ya likambo ya nsɔni na kati ya lisangá ya mibeko ya Grèce?,"The correct answer is **A: Baavoka** (Lawyers).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...*bavoka, bamagistrat mpe bakonzi basalaki na mibu eleki*."" (lawyers, magistrates and officials are involved in bad things). It also specifically names lawyers (Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos) being accused of wrongdoing.  The passage further details accusations against lawyers regarding improper influence and unethical behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bazuzi (Judges):** While judges are mentioned as being involved in ""bad things,"" the primary focus and specific accusations relate to the *lawyers*.
* **C: Bapanzi-sango (Legislators):**  Petros Mantouvalos is a legislator, but the core problem described revolves around the actions of *lawyers*.
* **D: Baavoka ya mibeko (Ethics Lawyers):**  This isn't a direct category mentioned in the text. The text focuses on lawyers generally being *implicated* in unethical behavior, not specifically ethics lawyers.



"
Ba guichets boni ebungaki na Inde?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Inde azwaki bapoint 36 pamba, **balongaki te ba poto 7 mpona kosukisa lisano.**"" 

This translates to: ""...India scored 36 points, **but lost 7 wickets to finish the innings.**""

Therefore, India lost 7 wickets (guichets in French)."
"Kolandana na bokomi, pwe nini ezalaki ya likolo ya masanos?","The question asks for the total score of the cricket match. The passage states Robin Uthappa scored 70 points. While other scores are mentioned, the question specifically asks for *the* score of the match, and Uthappa's score is presented as the key figure.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: 70 mbangu**.
"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali ntina ya kozanga bosepeli ya Adam Cuerden te?","The correct answer is **A: Politiki ya sika ya site oyo etali makambo ya kosangisa nzoto**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the community (bacommunes) is worried about the way Adam Cuerden ""amonisaki kanda na ye ndenge bazolongola bato ntango asololaka"" (monitors and how they moderate people when he makes mistakes) and that the issue stems from ""makambo etali mibeko"" (things that are problematic).  Specifically, it mentions ""milende ya sika ya kobimisa mobeko etali makambo ya kosangisa nzoto mpona site oyo eza na bamilo ya bavideo mpe bafoto"" (spending of money to address problems that come from harmful content on the site with videos and photos).  This directly points to the site's financial policy related to dealing with problematic content as the source of the conflict.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kolongolama ya mayemi ya Pays de Galles (Welsh government reforms):** While Wales is mentioned, the core issue isn't about government reforms.
* **C: Koyokama te na Pays de Galles (Not living in Wales):** Adam Cuerden *is* from Wales, according to the passage.
* **D: Lokuta na ntina ya bolongoli ya boyebi (Conflict regarding personal privacy):** The passage focuses on content moderation and financial policy, not personal privacy.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini elongolamaki na site?","The correct answer is **B: Makambo ya kosangisa nzoto** (Content that spreads false information).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...kanda ya bato wana ememaki na milende ya sika ya kobimisa mobeko etali makambo ya kosangisa nzoto mpona site oyo eza na bamilo ya bavideo mpe bafoto."" This directly translates to ""...the group spent a lot of money spreading false information on the site with videos and photos.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Boyebi (Advertising):** The passage doesn't mention advertising.
* **C: Projet ya politique générale (General political project):** While Adam Cuerden may have political views, the passage focuses on the *content* being spread, not a broad political project.
* **D: Bamedia ya moto moko (One person's media):** The passage describes a *group* effort to spread misinformation.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi Amir Khan azali kosunga te?","The correct answer is **C: Makanisi ya basi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Amir Khan said, ""Na motema na ngai nakanisi basi basengeli kobunda te. Eza makanisi na ngai."" (In my heart, I didn't think they should have been disqualified. It was a scandal for me.)
* **The question asks:** Where does Amir Khan disagree?
* **""Makanisi ya basi""** translates to ""the scandal of the boxing,"" which is the exact thing he expressed disagreement with - the disqualification he felt was unfair.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kolandana na bokomi, na oyo elandi:** This is too vague and doesn't directly relate to his stated disagreement.
* **B: Bawelani ya Angleterre:** While the Olympics were in London (England), his disagreement wasn't about the country itself.
* **D: Londres oyo ezali koyamba masano ya Olympique:**  Similarly to B, London is the location, not the *issue* he disagreed with.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, kati na oyo elandi Amir Khan akozala kosunga ata soki azali na makanisi na ye moko?","The correct answer is **A: Babundisi ya basi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on Amir Khan's willingness to fight through pain (""makanisi"") and his dedication to boxing.** He states he wouldn't want his opponents to stop fighting because of him. This directly relates to the spirit of *babundisi ya basi* (determination/perseverance in boxing).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Baninga na ye oyo bazalaki kobunda na masano ya Olympique ya 2004:** While mentioned, the passage isn't *about* his opponents in 2004, but his attitude.
* **C: Masano olympiques 2012:** The 2012 Olympics are just a detail illustrating his support for others, not the central theme.
* **D: Bato mosusu oyo bazwaki bamedayi ya palata:**  The passage focuses solely on Amir Khan.



"
Peter Lenz akufaki ntango nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Na lopitalo** (In the hospital).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...bamemaki ye na lopitalo moko ya mboka wana **esika akufaki na nsima**."" (they took him to a hospital in that city **where he died later**).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na ntango ya komitandisa mpo na kosana** (At the time of starting to race) - He crashed *during* preparation, but died *after* being taken to the hospital.
*   **B: Nsima ya kokweya na velo na ye** (While riding his bike) - He was injured in the accident, but didn't die immediately.
*   **D: Ntango azalaki na basali ya monganga oyo bazali na nzela** (When he was with the doctors who were on the track) - While doctors were involved, he died *in the hospital*, not on the track.



"
Xavier Zayat azali nani?,"The correct answer is **B: Mopoti mbangu mosusu** (Another racer).

Here's why:

The text states ""moto ya mboka na ye Xavier Zayat atutaki ye"" which translates to ""another racer Xavier Zayat hit him"". This clearly identifies Zayat as a fellow racer involved in the accident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mosali ya monganga oyo azali na nzela** (A doctor's assistant on the track) - The text doesn't mention Zayat being a medical professional.
*   **C: Monganga moko** (A doctor) - Same as above, no mention of Zayat being a doctor.
*   **D: Molingi** (A driver) - While technically correct that he drives, ""mopoti mbangu mosusu"" (another racer) is a more precise and informative answer based on the context.



"
Na ezalela nini moto oyo azali kotungisa mpɛpɔ akoki kozwa matomba soki ayebaki ndenge oyo mpɛpɔ esalaka na kati?,"The correct answer is **B: Soki koyina na bango kopumbwa ezali na katikati ya bobangi ya makambo oyo eyebani te.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""It's not a matter of liking sound: Don't get caught up in the state the person is in now and avoid other things people urgently need from them.""  This implies that the ""wind"" (mpɛpɔ - representing influence or emotion) is disruptive and prevents clear thinking and prioritization of what *really* matters.  Being ""caught up"" (kopumbwa) in the middle of that chaos (bobangi ya makambo oyo eyebani te - the chaos of things that aren't clear) is the danger.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Soki mokumbi motuka ayoki soni mpo na bobangi na bango:** (If a neighbor cries and makes noise for their problems) This is too specific and doesn't capture the broader idea of being overwhelmed by external influence.
* **C: Soki mokumbi motuka azali mabe na mitindo nyonso ya kokumba:** (If a neighbor is bad at all ways of gathering) This is irrelevant to the passage's point about being swayed by emotions/influence.
* **D: Soki mitungisi na bango euti na makambo ya mpasi oyo ezali na boyokani te na kopumbwa:** (If their decisions are based on bad things that aren't related to being confused)  While bad decisions are a result, the core issue is being *in* the confusion, not the decisions themselves.



Therefore, option B best reflects the warning in the passage about not getting lost in the ""wind"" of chaos and losing sight of what's important."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi oyo azali kosala mobembo asengeli kosala mpo na koumela?","The correct answer is **D: Talasite Internet ya kompanyi ya mpepo** (Check the company's website).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) specifically states:** ""...lisusu kotala na site intenert ya kompani wana ya mpepo liboso okanga esika."" This translates to ""...also check the company's website to find the location.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Luka makabo ya bakompanyi ya mibembo mingi** (Look at the profiles of many companies) - The passage doesn't suggest looking at *many* companies, but specifically the one being discussed.
* **B: Zua esika mbala moko na kopanyi ya mpepo** (Visit the location once at the wind company) - The passage implies finding the location *before* visiting.
* **C: Kokanisa ntalo kati na bakompanyi mingi ya mibembo** (Compare prices between many wind companies) - The passage isn't about comparing prices, it's about finding the location.

Therefore, option **D** directly addresses the advice given in the passage.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini bato oyo basalaka mibembo basengeli kosala liboso mpo na kozwa ntalo ya mpɛpɔ oyo eleki malamu?","The correct answer is **A: Talasite Internet ya kompanyi ya mpepo** (Check the company's website).

**Here's why:**

The passage (P) explicitly states: ""...*liboso okanga esika na site intenert ya kompani wana ya mpepo liboso okanga esika.*"" ( ...look for locations on the company's website).  This directly answers the question of what people needing to find good wind turbine locations should do.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tala talo na bitondisi mingi** (Consult many documents) - While research is important, the passage points to a specific source.
* **C: Zua esika mbala moko na kopanyi ya mpepo** (Visit a wind company location once) - A single visit isn't sufficient for a thorough search.
* **D: Zua esiki mbala moko na biro ya mobembo** (Visit a real estate office once) -  Real estate offices aren't the primary source for wind turbine location data.



"
Ntango nini moninga asengeli kokende elongo mpo na kotika biloko?,"The correct answer is **A: Ntango biloko etindami na nzela ya fret aérien** (When goods are shipped by air freight).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Soki batindaki biloko na mpepo, na banzela mosusu, elingaki kozwa mikolo mingi po bakitisa yango pe mpona douanes.""  This translates to: ""If goods are shipped by air, in other ways, it can take many days to clear them through customs."" This directly links air freight to the need for quicker customs clearance, implying it's the time when one should begin the process of getting things ready.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ntango entreprise esalelaka mpepo na ye moko** (When a company has its own airplane) - While mentioned, this doesn't specifically relate to *when* one should start the customs process.
* **C: Ntango biloko ezali kotindama lokola mokumba oyo endimami** (When goods are shipped like a personal package) -  The passage mentions this as a method to *avoid* procedures, not when to begin them.
* **D: Ntango mokumba esimbami na kopanyi ya monene** (When a package is sent by a large company) -  The size of the company sending the goods doesn't dictate *when* customs preparation should begin.



"
"Na kotalela eteni yango, ntango ozali kopona kompanyi ya mpepo ya Frequent Flyer na boyokani, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi osengeli kotya na esika ya liboso?","The correct answer is **A: Kopanyi ya mpepo oyo epesaka pwe mingi** (The wind company that offers the most electricity).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) emphasizes maximizing profit.** It states companies should prioritize generating electricity (power) even if it means taking lower rates sometimes. They should focus on *volume* of production because that often leads to better deals and points with other companies.
* **Frequent Flyer is in a competitive situation.**  The question asks where to focus *first* in a negotiation. 
* **Option A directly addresses maximizing power output.**  A company that produces more power has more leverage in negotiations, aligning with the passage's advice.

Let's look at why the other options are less ideal:

* **B: Kopanyi ya mpepo kati na boyokani ya munene** (Wind company in a large competition) - While competition exists, the passage doesn't say to prioritize *where* you are in a competition, but *what* you offer.
* **C: Kopanyi ya mpepo oyo otambolaka na yango mbala mingi** (Wind company that operates frequently) - Frequency of operation is good, but it doesn't necessarily translate to profitability.
* **D: Kopanyi yam pepo oyo ekoki kobakisa libaku malamu ya kobakisa** (Wind company that can secure good deals) - This is a result of maximizing power, not the initial focus.  You secure deals *because* you have a lot to offer.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nani akoki kopesa pwe ya kopanyi mbala mingi koleka?","The correct answer is **C: Kopanyi na yo ya mpepo oyo otambolaka mbala mingi na yango kati na bosangani mosusu.**

Here's why:

* **The prompt (P) discusses a company that frequently codeshares (operates flights marketed by another airline) with other airlines.** This means they often fly *on behalf of* other companies.
* **The question (Q) asks who benefits most from codeshares.**
* **Option C** directly addresses this - a *your* airline that operates many flights *within* other partnerships (bosangani mosusu) clearly benefits from the arrangement.  They get to fill seats and earn revenue without the full marketing/sales cost.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kopanyi yam pepo mosusu na bosangani mosusu** (Another airline in another partnership) - This doesn't directly benefit from *your* company's codesharing.
* **B: Compagnie na yo ya avion oyo osalaka mibembo mingi na se ya alliance moko** (Your airline that codeshares a lot within one alliance) -  While an alliance is good, the prompt implies partnerships *outside* a single formal alliance are more lucrative.
* **D: Kopanyi ya mpepo kati na bosangani moko** (An airline within one partnership) -  Too general; doesn't specify the benefit related to *your* company's codesharing efforts.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, eteni nini ya nzoto kati na oyo elandi ekoki kobeba mpo na komɛla masanga mingi?","The passage (P) warns about the dangers of homemade alcohol (masanga). It states that consuming too much homemade alcohol can lead to liver disease, brain damage, and even death. It also highlights the presence of dangerous substances like methanol in these alcohols.

The question (Q) asks what a person should do to avoid the dangers mentioned in the passage.

Let's look at the options:

* **A: Koyoka (To refuse/decline)** - This is the best answer. Refusing to drink homemade alcohol is the most direct way to avoid the risks outlined in the passage.
* **B: Komona (To see/watch)** - This doesn't help you avoid the danger.
* **C: Elengi (To taste)** - Tasting it exposes you to the danger.
* **D: Nsolo (Salt)** - Salt has nothing to do with preventing the harm from bad alcohol.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Koyoka**.



"
"Lokola elobami na mokapo yango, nini ekoki kokitisa bopusi mabe ya masanga?","The correct answer is **B: Komela masanga ya makasi oyo ebimisami na ndenge oyo eyokani te na mibeko** (Consuming counterfeit or illegally produced alcohol).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...Bilimo ya mabe ekoki kozala na biloko ya mbindo oyo eza likama ata pe méthanol, oyo ekoki koboma miso to koboma yo ata soki ozwi yango moke mpenza."" (Harmful substances like methanol can be found in illegally produced alcohol, which can damage your brain or kill you even if you drink only a little).  This directly points to the danger of *how* the alcohol is made, not just that it's alcohol itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Komela masanga elongo na methanol** (Drinking alcohol with methanol) - While methanol *is* the danger, the passage warns about it being *in* illegal alcohol, not simply drinking methanol alongside alcohol.
* **C: Komela masanga na bokatikati** (Drinking alcohol in general) - The passage doesn't condemn alcohol itself, but highlights the risks of *bad* alcohol.
* **D: Komela na bato ndenge na ndenge** (Drinking with different people) - This is irrelevant to the dangers discussed in the passage.



"
Wapi mwa ndambo ya motuya ya biloko oyo eleki likoló na Amsterdam?,"The correct answer is **C: Bitando oyo elongolamaki na Binnenstad**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Etuka ya Canal...ezalaka zingazinga ya Binnenstad d'Amsterdam."" (The Canal area...is located within the Binnenstad of Amsterdam.)
* Binnenstad is the central, historic part of Amsterdam.  The canals *are* within that area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: District ya Canal** - While technically correct, the passage focuses on the *location* within Amsterdam, not simply naming the area.
* **B: Na esika nyonso oyo e eponamaki lokola UNESCO, libula y amokili mobimba** - The UNESCO recognition is a *characteristic* of the area, not its location *within* Amsterdam.
* **D: Bisika oyo ezali na motuya ya lisolo ya bato** - This is too general; many places have a connection to people's history.



"
Mpo na nini Etuka ya Canal eponamaki lokola Libula ya Mokili mobimba na UNESCO?,"The correct answer is **A: Ezali motuya na ntina ya makambo eleki mpe na ntina ya bokoko** (It is rich in historical and cultural value).

Here's why:

The passage states the Canal Ring is a UNESCO World Heritage site ""mpona bokoko na yango na masolo ya kala, pe ndako ya ntina mingi na kati ya bandako kitoko ya mboka"" - meaning *because of its historical value and its importance within the city's cultural landscape*. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B & D: Ezali na talo mpenza** (It has deep water) - While the canals *have* water, that's not the reason for UNESCO recognition.
* **C: Ezali esika oyo ezali zingazinga ya Binnenstad** (It is the center of Binnenstad) -  Being the center is a *location* characteristic, not the *reason* it's a World Heritage site.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi esalaka ete kokende na Phnom Krom ezala na ntina?","The correct answer is **B: Kosala mobembo na nzela ya Angkor Pass**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...bakoki mpenza kosangisa yango na mwa mobembo ya masuwa mpona kotala etima. Esika ya koleka na Angkor eza ntina mingi mpona kokota na tempelo, yango wana kobosana te komema passeport na yo ntango ozokende na Tonlé Sap.""

This translates to: ""...visitors often include it with their tour packages. The location near Angkor has a lot of advantages over visiting the temple, you don't need your passport when you go to Tonle Sap.""

This clearly indicates that visiting Phnom Krom is often done *with* an Angkor Pass, making it the reason it's advantageous.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Talatala na likolo ya Tonle Sap** (Located on Tonle Sap Lake) - While Phnom Krom *is* near Tonle Sap, the text doesn’t say that's why it’s advantageous to visit.
*   **C: Komona Siem Reap** (Visiting Siem Reap) - Phnom Krom is *near* Siem Reap, but that's not the reason for the advantage.
*   **D: Mobembo ya masuwa na laki** (Tour packages on the lake) - The text says packages *include* Phnom Krom, not that it's because of tour packages *on* the lake.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini esengeli mpo ete bapaya bákota na Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **A: Komata koleka tempelo ya Yasovarman**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Tempelo oyo eza na mawa ngomba batongaki yango na suka ya ekeke ya 9, na nse ya boyangeli ya mokonzi Yasovarma."" (This temple was built on the site where it was founded in the 9th century, under the reign of King Yasovarma.) This directly links Phnom Krom to Yasovarman.
* **The text also mentions:** ""Vizite ya esika wana bakoki mpenza kosangisa yango na mwa mobembo ya masuwa mpona kotala etima."" (Visits to this place can often be combined with boat trips, especially at sunset.) This suggests getting *to* Phnom Krom involves a boat trip, but the primary reason to go is the temple itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kosala mobembo zingazinga ya Siem Reap:** While Phnom Krom is near Siem Reap, the text doesn't say you need to arrange a specific trip *from* Siem Reap.
* **C: Kozwa makoki ya koleka ya Angkor:** The text states you *don't* need a passport to visit Phnom Krom when coming from Tonle Sap, so needing Angkor passes is incorrect.
* **D: Kokende na masuwa zingazinga ya Tonle Sap:** While a boat trip is often *part* of visiting, it’s not the primary requirement.  You are going *to see the temple*.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kopekisa mopaya akende kotala Antarctique?","The correct answer is **C: Manaka ya mosala oyo epesaka nzela ya kosala mobembo na sanza ya zomi na mibale mpe ya sanza ya yambo** (Skills that allow for travel during the short summers and long winters).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the extreme conditions of Antarctica:** intense cold, isolation, the need for significant resources, and the very short window for travel (summer).  Successfully traveling to and surviving in Antarctica requires specialized skills to cope with these conditions – skills applicable to both the short summer travel window *and* the long, harsh winters.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Budget ya mobembo monene (Large travel budget):** While a large budget is *necessary*, it doesn't guarantee success.  Skills are needed to *use* that budget effectively to survive.
* **B: Intérêt seul ya ko explorer Mbu Ross (Sole interest in exploring Ross Sea):**  Interest is motivation, but insufficient for survival.  Antarctica is far more challenging than just wanting to see a specific location.
* **D: Koningisa nzoto ezali na ndelo (Knowing cold is in the blood):**  While acclimatization is helpful, simply being ""used to cold"" isn't enough to overcome the extreme conditions described.  Specialized skills and preparation are crucial.



Therefore, **C** is the most logical answer, aligning directly with the passage’s depiction of the demanding requirements for Antarctic travel."
Mopaya oyo alingaka komata bangomba akoki kokende na eteni nini ya Antarctique?,"The correct answer is **A: Mbu ya Ross**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...pe esukaka kaka na esanga, na bisanga pe na **mbu Ross**."" (and it only appears on the coast, and in the regions of Ross Sea).  It also says the one who likes to swim can only do so in summer and in the Ross Sea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Etando ya Inland (Inland Plateau)** - The text describes the inland plateau as being covered in 2-3km of ice, not suitable for swimming.
*   **C: Esanga (Coast)** - While mentioned as a place it *appears*, the text specifically links swimming to the Ross Sea.
*   **D: Bisanga (Regions)** -  Too general; the Ross Sea is the specific location.



"
Esika ya kotala y akoya liboso na makambo ya sika ezali wapi?,"The correct answer is **C: Na esika oyo ezali mosika**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Batelescope ebele ya bolukiluki ya lelo eza bisika ya minene oyo eza na bisika ya mosika oyo ezalaka na mopepe ya malamu.""  This translates to: ""Modern research telescopes are large instruments located on mountains, often in remote areas.""

Therefore, the location of observing is on a **mountain** (mosika).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na esika oyo okoki kokota na yango kozanga mpasi** - This is too vague.
*   **B: Na katikati ya engumba moko** - The passage implies they are *outside* of cities, not in the middle of them.
*   **D: Na kelasi moko ya eteyelo monene** - Observatories are not in classrooms.



"
Ekoki kozala ete télescope ya bolukiluki ya mikolo na biso ekozala wapi?,"The correct answer is **D: Na esika moko monene** (In a large place).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Batelescope ebele ya bolukiluki ya lelo eza bisika ya minene oyo eza na bisika ya mosika oyo ezalaka na mopepe ya malamu."" This translates to ""Modern research telescopes are large structures that are on extensive sites with clear skies.""  This implies they need a *large place* to be built.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Na esika ya kobatela biloko ya kala (In a place to store old things):** The passage contrasts modern telescopes with old ones that were often in basements or on campuses - not storage.
* **B: Na eteyelo monene (In a large city):** The passage highlights the need for *clear skies*, which are rarely found in large cities due to light pollution.
* **C: Na esika moko ya mateya (In a dark place):** While a dark location *is* important, the passage emphasizes the *size* of the location needed.  ""Dark"" doesn't fully capture the meaning of ""extensive sites"".



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, esika nini ekozala malamu mpo na mokolo ya kimya na libongo?","The correct answer is **B: Mission Bay**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mabongo ya Tamaki Drive ezalaka na libongo ya Waitemata, na basonge ya malamu ya **Mission Bay** na St Heliers na katikati ya Auckland."" (The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on the Waitemata harbor, with the beautiful surroundings of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.)

The question asks for a good place for a quiet day *on the beach*. Mission Bay and St Heliers are specifically mentioned as beautiful beach areas. While St Heliers is also mentioned, Mission Bay is presented first and equally.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: St Heliers:** While a beautiful area, it's presented alongside Mission Bay, not singled out as particularly good for a quiet day.
*   **C: The North Harbor District:** This is a broader geographical area, not a specific beach.
*   **D: Waitemata Harbor:** This is a harbor, not a beach.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo elekiKolandana na bokomi, esika nini emonani kozala na libateli malamu mpo na kobeta mai ?","The correct answer is **A: Devonport**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mabongo ya ndambo ya nordi (na etuka ya North Harbour) ezalaka na mbu ya Pacifique mpe ebandaka na Long Bay na **nordi ya Devonport** na sudi.""  It then says the beaches are often good for swimming, *especially* those with Pohutukawa shade.  Devonport is specifically mentioned as a northern location with beaches suitable for swimming.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: North Harbor District:** While beaches are *in* North Harbour, the passage doesn't pinpoint it as the *best* for swimming.
* **C: Central Auckland:** The passage mentions beaches along Tamaki Drive (central Auckland), but says they were previously developed with shops and buildings, implying they aren't as good for swimming now.
* **D: Long Bay:** Long Bay is mentioned, but as a location *within* the North Harbour area, not as a particularly good swimming spot itself.



"
"Ntango ozali kotala esika oyo mokapo yango elobeli, oyo wapi na makambo oyo elandi ekotalelama lokola oyo ebongi te?","The correct answer is **A: Kosala makambo ya lokumu** (Do things normally).

Here's why:

The prompt (P) describes a deeply sensitive and tragic situation – a place associated with immense suffering, likely referencing the Holocaust or similar atrocities. It *specifically* instructs to ""Salela esika makambo na lokumu"" which translates to ""Treat the place normally"" or ""Do things as usual there.""  This is a deliberate instruction to avoid sensationalizing, memorializing in a way that causes further harm, or exploiting the tragedy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kotika elembo esika moko boye zingazinga ya esika yango** (Write a sign about the place's history) - The prompt specifically discourages drawing attention to the place and its history in a memorializing way.
* **C: Kosala maseki** (Make a memorial) - This is *explicitly forbidden* in the prompt (""Kosala maseki te mpona Holocauste to Banazi"" – Do not make a memorial like the Holocaust or Nazis).
* **D: Kokatakata eloko moko oyo etongami** (Talk about something that happened) -  This could lead to dwelling on the tragedy, which the prompt aims to avoid.



Therefore, **A** is the only option that aligns with the instructions given in the prompt."
"Na kati na yango, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola minoko oyo esanganisi minoko mingi?","The correct answer is **D: Organique**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""...ya kokabwana na lingua francas, oyo eza na minoko ya **organique** oyo bato oyo balobaki minoko mosusu bakomaki kosalela mingi...""  (It's about lingua francas, which are based on **organic** sounds that people who speak other languages can easily adopt or a particular thing or another.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ebongisami:** This means ""agreement"" or ""harmony"" and doesn't fit the context of the passage.
* **B: Ya kosangisa:** This means ""to mix"" or ""to blend"" and doesn't directly relate to the foundation of a lingua franca.
* **C: Etongamaki:** This means ""a machine"" or ""mechanisms"" and is completely unrelated to the passage's discussion of language.



Therefore, **Organique** is the only answer that aligns with the information provided in the text."
Liloba nini elimboli na bosikisiki te minoko ya lisalisi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ezali minoko biologiquess oyo esalelamaka mpo na kosalisa kosolola kati ya batu oyo bakoki kososola na bango te.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a ""balokota"" (a term for a facilitator/middleman) who helps people reproduce when they otherwise couldn't.** This directly points to a biological function related to reproduction.
* **Option A** accurately captures this - it refers to a biological function (minoko biologiques) used to facilitate reproduction (kosalisa kosolola) between people who cannot do so themselves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ezali minoko oyo ezali na ndenge ya bomoto mpe oyo etongami:** This translates to ""It is a spirit-like and talking thing."" The passage doesn't suggest anything supernatural or about the *balokota* talking.
* **C: Ezali minoko oyo etongami mpo na kobongisa ba Makambo ya kosolola:** This translates to ""It is a thing that speaks to organize things for reproduction."" Again, there's no mention of speaking or organizing.
* **D: Ezali minoko oyo esalemi oyo ezali na bokonzi kati na balobi ya minoko ndenge na ndenge:** This translates to ""It is a learned thing that is important among speakers of different languages."" While the passage *mentions* language (lingua francas), the core function isn't about language skills, but reproduction.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, mokumbi motuka asengeli kotala nini soki mobembo na bango ya masuwa ezali na eleko ya malili?","The correct answer is **B: Bosengeli ya visa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bato oyo bamataka na kati na yango basengaka bango te komema viza (landela masengami)."" This translates to ""People traveling within it do not need a visa (according to the rules).""
* **The question asks:** What should a traveler consider if their cruise stops in a foreign city?
* **Visa requirements** are the most important thing to consider when traveling internationally, and the passage specifically states visas aren't needed *within* the Baltic Sea cruise, but potentially *for* the cities it visits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Esika ya kabine (Cabin location):**  While mentioned, cabin location isn't a critical consideration for a foreign city stop.
* **C: Maloba (Speeches/Talks):** Irrelevant to travel regulations.
* **D: Ntango oyo balekisaka na engumba (Time they disembark in the city):**  Important for planning, but doesn't address the core issue of legal entry.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, soki mobembo ya mobembo ya mokumbi motuka ezali na eleko ya molunge, nini bakoki kozala na likoki ya kokima?","The correct answer is **C: Bosengeli ya visa** (Visa requirement).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bato oyo bamataka na kati na yango basengaka bango te komema viza (landela masengami)."" - ""Those who travel within it do not need a visa (depending on agreements).""
* **The question asks:** What can happen if an individual's passport is lost while traveling?  The passage implies a key issue for travelers is visa status. Losing a passport *without* a visa requirement is different than losing one *with* a requirement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ntango na engumba** (Time in the city) - This isn't related to a lost passport.
* **B: Koleka na kati ya glace** (Getting stuck in the ice) - While the passage mentions icebreakers, it doesn't relate to lost passports.
* **D: Saint Petersburg** (Saint Petersburg) -  The city's existence doesn't help someone who's lost their passport.

Mpo na nini basalelaka mingi monoko ya Catalan mpo na bilembo mpe mayebisi na Barcelone?,"The correct answer is **C: Ezali monoko oyo bato balingaka mingi na Barcelone** (It is the language that people prefer the most in Barcelona).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""bilembo mingi ezolakisa kaka na Catalan po endimami na mibeko lokola lokota ya leta"" (many signs are only in Catalan for cultural reasons like the language of the state). This shows a preference for Catalan in official/cultural displays.
* **The text also says:** While many *understand* Spanish, Catalan is used for the ""identity"" aspects (like signs) and is preferred.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bato basosoli yango mingi koleka Espagnol** (Most of the inhabitants are Spanish) - The text doesn't focus on the *nationality* of the people, but on their language use.
* **B: Ezalaki monoko ya liboso officiel na engumba** (It was the official language of the city) - The text doesn't state Catalan is officially the *only* language, it just says it's prominent in cultural displays.  Spanish is also used extensively.
* **D: Métro mpe bisika mosusu ya bato nyonso ekendaka mingimingi na bana-mboka oyo balobaka monɔkɔ ya Catalan** (The metro and other transportation systems focus a lot on people who speak Catalan) - The text states the opposite: the metro offers multiple languages, including Spanish.



"
"Na minoko oyo elandi, oyo wapi esalelamaka na Système ya Metro ya Barcelone mpo na kopesa mayebisi mbala na mbala?","The correct answer is **C: Espagnol**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mayebisi ya mbla na mbala na Metro epesamaka kaka na lokota ya Catalan po endimami na mibeko lokola lokota ya leta. Atako bongo, basalelaka mingi lokota ya Espagne na transport ya bato nyonso pe na bisika mosusu.""  This translates to: ""Announcements in the Metro are made in Catalan for institutional reasons like the language of the state. However, they *primarily* use Spanish for transport of all people and on other devices.""

While Catalan is used for certain announcements, Spanish is used more widely, especially for practical information for all passengers.  The text also specifically mentions that the automatic voice system has multiple languages *including* Spanish.

"Na kotalela mokapo, nini kati na biloko oyo elandi ekoki kozala te na esika ya liboso na mbeto mpe bilei ya ntɔ́ngɔ́ ya likoló?","The correct answer is **B: Biloko ya ndako ya kala oyo ekokani na mosusu te** (Properties of old amenities that cannot be shared).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Esika oyo ekoki kozala ndako ya kitoko ya kala oyo eza na biloko ya kala, bilanga ya kikoto pe piscine."" (This could be old amenities located in old properties, small gardens and swimming pools).  It then implies these are *difficult* to find in modern B&Bs because they are becoming rarer or are exclusive to certain properties.  The passage is contrasting the ""good old days"" of B&Bs with the modern situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Biloko ya kolia ya bomoko mpenza** (Expensive food items) - This isn't mentioned as a problem in the passage.
* **C: Bisika ya libanda oyo ebatelami malamu** (Difficulties with reservations) - While reservations *are* mentioned (bisika ya malamu mingi), the passage doesn't say they prevent finding these amenities.
* **D: WiFi ya mbangu** (Slow WiFi) - WiFi isn't discussed in the passage at all.



"
"Na kotalela eteni oyo, na kati ya makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali te moko ya makambo minene ya momekano kati na ba B&B ya kitoko?","The correct answer is **C: Mbeto ya nsuka ya likolo** (Lack of a modern look/aesthetic).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Na likolo ya nyonso, eza polele ete B&Bs bamekanaka na biloko mibale ya ntina: bilamba ya bambeto pe bilei ya ntongo."" (Generally, B&Bs are characterized by old-fashioned settings: old furniture and antique objects). This implies a *lack* of a modern look is common.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kongalisa ya mikolo oyo** (Congestion of these days) - The passage doesn't mention crowding or busy periods.
* **B: Bilei mingi ya elengi ya ntongo oyo epesami** (Many antique objects that exist) - The passage actually *describes* B&Bs as having antique objects, so this isn't a negative or a lacking feature.
* **D: Bilei mpe limeli oyo euti na mboka** (Furniture and items that are local) - The passage doesn’t discuss whether the furniture or items are local or not.



Therefore, the passage points to the old-fashioned aesthetic as a common characteristic, meaning a modern look is often *missing* from these B&Bs."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, kati na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekosalema na Pékin te na 2022?","The correct answer is **C: Milulu ya bosukisi**.

Here's why:

The text states Beijing hosted events for ice sports (""milulu ya bofungoli"", ""milulu ya glace ya kati ya ndako"") and skiing (at Taizicheng and Zhangjiakou). It specifically mentions that *skiing* events were held *outside* of Beijing, about 220km away.  Therefore, the only option that wasn't held *in* Beijing is skiing – specifically, the ""milulu ya bosukisi"" (ski slopes).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Milulu ya bofungoli (Ice hockey):** The text says Beijing hosted ice hockey.
* **B: Milulu ya esika ya ski ya Taizicheng (Taizicheng ski resort):** While Taizicheng *was* used, the question asks what wasn't in Beijing, and Taizicheng is specifically stated to be *outside* Beijing.
* **D: Milulu ya glace ya kati ya ndako (Speed skating):** The text says Beijing hosted speed skating.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi na oyo elandi ekoyambama na Pékin na 2022?","The correct answer is **A: Masano olympiques ya eleko ya moi (Winter Olympic Games)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Engumba ya Beijing na Chine yango nde ekoyamba masano ya Olympiques ya eleko ya mpio makasi ya 2022"" which translates to ""The city of Beijing in China will host the 2022 Winter Olympic Games."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Makambo ya glace oyo ezali kosalema na kati ya ndako (Ice sports that are held indoors):** While ice sports *are* part of the Winter Olympics, it's not the overall event that's being hosted.
* **C: Masno olympique ya eleko ya malili (Summer Olympic Games):** The text specifically mentions the *Winter* Olympics.
* **D: Milulu ya bosukisi (Ski races):**  Skiing is *a part* of the Winter Olympics, but not the entire event.

Nani azali na likama mingi ya kozwa grippe aviaire?,"The correct answer is **A: Bato oyo batalaka bandeke** (People who raise chickens).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Gripe ya bandeke, to oyo eyebani na nkombo ya gripe aviaire, ekoki kozwa bandeke na banyama. ... mosala ya kokanga bandeke ezalaka na mwa makama."" (Chicken flu, which is a type of avian flu, can spread from chickens to animals... the work of raising chickens is at risk).  This directly links raising chickens to the risk of contracting avian flu.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bato oyo basalaka na banyama oyo ememaka mabele:** (People who live near animals that carry diseases) - While proximity to animals *can* increase risk, the passage specifically highlights those *raising* chickens.
* **C: Basali ya nyama ya mboka:** (Meat workers) -  The passage doesn't mention meat workers.
* **D: Bato oyo bazwaki yango liboso:** (People who got sick before) - Past illness doesn't necessarily increase the risk of avian flu.

Mingi etaleli bato oyo basalaka misala ya kobokola bibwele, kasi mosala ya kokanga bandeke ezalaka na mwa makama.""  This translates to ""Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, can spread from poultry to humans... Many people get infected when eating birds, but handling poultry is most risky.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kaka baoyo basali esika ya kobatela soso nde bazwaki grippe yango** (Only those who are in close contact with sick birds get the flu) - The passage doesn't limit it to *sick* birds, just handling poultry in general.
* **B: Bato mingi bazwaki maladi yango koleka bandeke** (Many people get the disease from birds) - While true, it's not the *most* risky way according to the passage.  Handling is specifically highlighted as higher risk.
* **D: Nionso oyo elobami na ntina ya batu ezaliki ya liwa** (Everything said about humans is about death) - The passage doesn't focus solely on death; it discusses how people get the disease.

Mbu ya Pembe–Canal Baltique ekangisaka nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Océan Arctique mpe Mbu Baltique**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nzela ya mbu ya mbu Blanche-Baltique esangisaka mbu ya Arctique na mbu ya Baltique..."" which translates to ""The White Sea-Baltic Sea waterway connects the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mbu Moindo mpe Mbu ya Caspien:** While the passage mentions these seas, it doesn't say the Pembe–Canal Baltique connects them.
*   **B: Lac Onega mpe Ebale Volga:** These are mentioned as being *along* a route, but not directly connected *by* the waterway.
*   **D: Mbu ya Sudi mpe Mbu Motane:** These seas are not mentioned in the passage.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na lolenge nini ya motuka bakoki kozwa ba passeport mpo na kokata mokumbi maloba te?","The correct answer is **B: Engbunduka ya butu** (Border crossing by foot).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Na bingbunduka oyo ezalaka bambeto na butu, mokumbi akoki kozwa ba passeport mpo bakata yo te pongi na yo.""  This directly translates to: ""At border crossings on foot, officials can seize passports to arrest you or prevent you from leaving.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bampepo (Wind):**  Wind is mentioned as a factor for boats, but not related to passport seizure.
* **C: Masuwa (Canoes):** Canoes are mentioned as a mode of transport, but not the context of passport seizure.
* **D: Engbunduka oyo ekatisaka ndelo (Border crossing that causes trouble):** This is a general description, but not the *specific* situation described where passports are seized – which is when crossing *on foot*.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ntango nini bakoki kotala carte na yo kati na Engbunduka mosusu oyo ekatisaka ndelo?","The correct answer is **A: Nsima ya kokita na engbunduka** (When you are about to enter the country).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...na biloko na nzela ntango engbunduka ezotambola mpe osengeli kozala na identite ya malamu na maboko ntango ozomata na bingbunduka wana.""  This translates to ""...and documents on the road when the border crossing is happening and you need to have proper identification in your hands when you arrive at that border crossing.""

This directly implies that your *carte* (identification/passport) will be checked **when you are about to enter the country** (at the border crossing).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tango ozali kolala** (When you are sleeping) - This is irrelevant.
* **C: Ezuaka inspection te** (Without inspection) - The passage explicitly states inspection *is* required.
* **D: Na engbunduka oyo ezali kopota mbangu** (At a very busy border crossing) - While the passage mentions busy crossings, it doesn't specify *when* they check your carte, just *where* it happens.



"
"Na oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali makambo oyo ekoki kobima mingi ntango ozali kotikala na esika oyo ezali na mikili ya molunge makasi na Singapour?","The correct answer is **C: Konyokwama na kolɛmba ya molunge** (Getting used to the humidity).

Here's why:

* **P's statement** explicitly mentions needing to get used to humidity (""molunge"") and heat (""moi makasi"") because Singapore is near the equator.  It says you should *prepare* for humidity.
* **Option C** directly addresses this preparation - getting used to the humidity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ntango nini bakoki koyiba (When can they bring)** - This is irrelevant to the text.
* **B: Kozanga kokoma na butike (Shopping in a store)** -  Shopping isn't related to adapting to the climate.
* **D: kobunga nzela (Changing direction/route)** - This also has no connection to the passage's advice.



Therefore, **C** is the only option that accurately reflects the advice given in the passage regarding living in Singapore's humid climate."
Nani akoki kolinga koboya kolya mampa ya Allemagne?,"The correct answer is **B: Moto oyo alingaka mingi ba desserts ya richesse** (Someone who really likes rich desserts).

Here's why:

* **The text describes German pastries as:** rich, with lots of butter, plums, and often enjoyed with strong coffee.  Words like ""ya kitoko mingi"" (very tasty) and descriptions of butter, plums, and cream all point to rich desserts.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Moto oyo azali na allergie makasi na noix (Someone with a severe nut allergy):** The text mentions prunes (""baprunes"") but doesn't focus on nuts, and rich pastries *often* contain nuts, making this a bad choice.
    * **C: Moto oyo alingaka chocolat te (Someone who doesn't like chocolate):** The text doesn't mention chocolate. The pastries described aren't necessarily chocolate-focused.
    * **D: Moto oyo alingaka bilei ya sukali na esika ya elɛngi ya elengi (Someone who likes simple, everyday food):**  The text explicitly describes *complex* and rich pastries, not simple everyday foods.



"
Biloko ya kolamba na yango nini etalelami lokola eloko ya kobakisa elengi na mapaAllemand?,"The correct answer is **A: Pommes**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bisika batekaka bambuma eza mingi, eza na bapome balamba mbula mobimba mpe baserize na baprunes oyo ebimaka na eleko ya molunge.""  This translates to ""The cakes are very numerous, with baked apples that spend a long time and are sprinkled with plums that come from the orchard.""  

While prunes (C) *are* mentioned, the text specifically highlights **apples (pommes)** as a key ingredient in many German cakes. The other options (nzete ya ndunda - peanuts, amandes - almonds) are not mentioned in the text.



"
"Kolandana na bokomi, oyo wapi kati na makambo oyo elandi ekozala te toli oyo esɛngami mpo na kosala mobembo na budget?","The correct answer is **D: Kitisa ba dépenses lokola biloko ya kolia pe ya kolala** (Reduce expenses like food and lodging).

Here's why:

The passage discusses living within one's means and avoiding debt. It emphasizes not overspending, not relying on others, and being self-sufficient.  Reducing expenses on necessities like food and lodging directly addresses the core message of living within a budget (making do with limited funds).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Luká misala ya kokamwa oyo osengeli kosala na boumeli ya mibembo na yo** (List the things you need to do with your limited funds) - While *planning* is important, the passage focuses on *reducing* spending.
* **B: Yeba kokota (flexible) na nivo ya esika oyo ezalii malamu mpo na yo** (Be flexible in the area that is comfortable for you) - Flexibility isn't the central theme; responsible spending is.
* **C: Senga bato mbongo** (Borrow from rich people) - The passage explicitly warns *against* relying on others or borrowing.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nani akoki kozala na mokakatano mpo na kosala mobembo na budget moke mpenza?","The correct answer is **A: Moto oyo ayambaka mokakatano moko** (The person who starts with one difficulty).

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

The passage emphasizes that someone with *limited resources* (like a single difficulty - ""mokakatano moko"") can still achieve success (become an entrepreneur - ""kosala mobembo""). It contrasts this with people who have many problems (""mibale"") and struggle to overcome them.  The passage suggests starting small and building from there is key.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Moto oyo azali na mikakatano makasi ya ntango** (The person who has many time difficulties) - The text doesn't focus on *time* difficulties, but rather overall obstacles to success.
* **C: Moto oyo azali kokana kosala na mosika ntango azali kosala mobembo** (The person who is trying to do things with money while becoming an entrepreneur) - While money is mentioned, the primary focus is overcoming *any* initial difficulty, not specifically financial ones.
* **D: Moto oyo asepelaka kolanda programme ya mobembo** (The person who enrolls in an entrepreneurship program) - The text emphasizes self-reliance and starting with what you have, not necessarily formal programs.



Therefore, **A** best reflects the core message of the text: even with a single initial challenge, entrepreneurship is possible."
"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola malamu te motuka oyo ezali koleka kati na Point Marion mpe Fairmont?","The correct answer is **C: Batosaka ndelo ya mbangu mingi te**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""po mbala mingi okoleka ma nsima ya banzete na bisika oyo bato baza te."" This translates to ""and often lacks shoulders and sidewalks where people don't go.""  This directly indicates that speed limits are often not enforced (bato baza te = people don't go/there's no presence) and therefore, drivers don't follow speed limits appropriately.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ezali na bisika milai ya nzela ya mboka oyo ezali mosika:** The passage mentions narrow roads, but doesn't directly state this *causes* the dangerous driving.
* **B: Banzela ekangemi:** The passage mentions curves, but doesn't say the road is congested.
* **D: Service ya téléphone portable esengeli kozala likambo te:** The passage mentions poor cell service *is* a problem, not that it shouldn't be.



"
"Kolandana na bokomi, nini kati na yango esengeli kozala likambo oyo ezali kotungisa mingi basofɛlɛ oyo bazali kosala mobembo na nzela monene ya Buffalo-Pittsburg?","The correct answer is **B: Kozanga ya service cellulaire oyo ekoki** (Poor cellular service).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""likambo ya kokamwa, misala ya telefone ya maboko eza mpasi mingi awa koleka na bisika mosusu na nzela..."" (a problem, cell phone signals are often poor here compared to other roads...). This directly links poor cellular service to a major inconvenience for drivers on this stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh route.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kokangama na mituka mingi** (Congestion with many trucks) - While the passage mentions trucks, it doesn't present congestion as the *primary* issue troubling drivers.
* **C: Kosala tour ya makasi mbangu mingi** (Having many scenic detours) -  The passage describes a difficult road, not a scenic one.
* **D: Kokutana na misala ya nzela mbala na mbala** (Encountering different road conditions) - The passage does mention varying road conditions (gravel, dirt), but the biggest highlighted problem is the cell service.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi esengeli te mpo na kobanda kotambola kti na bangomba?","The correct answer is **A: Likoki ya kobeta mai** (The ability to catch fish).

Here's why:

The passage (P) states the Kosala canoe is *for* catching fish (kobeta mai), getting across (komata), and traveling (kopumbwa).  It also explicitly says it *doesn't* require a lot of strength or a lot of money to build – only the ability to catch fish (like using a net, and potentially learning from others - ""soki tokokanisi yango na ndakisa na komata bangomba"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ndenge esika ya likolo mpenza emonani:** (The appearance of the canoe's hull) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the hull's appearance being unimportant.
* **C: Makoki ya kopumbwa:** (The ability to travel) - While the canoe *can* be used for travel, it's not what the passage identifies as *not* being a requirement for building it.
* **D: Mwa ndambo moke ya formation:** (A single method of construction) - The passage doesn't discuss construction methods at all.



Therefore, the passage directly contrasts the need for strength or money with the *need* for the ability to fish."
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kozala na ntina mpo na mobembo ya malamu na mabanga?","The correct answer is **D: Makoki ya kobeta mai (The ability to carry/transport goods)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the Kosala canoe's function:** It's described as being used for carrying, loading, and unloading goods (kobeta mai, komata, kopumbwa).  The passage even contrasts it with canoes used simply for travel (""kokauka to etondi na mai"").
* **The question asks about potential for economic development:**  The ability to transport goods is *fundamental* to economic activity and trade within communities (""na mabanga"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Makoki ya masno oyo ekeyi liboso mpenza (The skills of those who use it first)** - The passage doesn't focus on the skill of the users, but the canoe's *capability*.
* **B: Oyo eyebanaki liboso na kozinda na mai (That which is first used for traveling on the water)** - The passage explicitly states it *isn't* primarily for traveling.
* **C: Mokanda ya kosilisa kelasi ya kotambola kati na ngomba (A method for organizing classes to circulate within a community)** - This is completely unrelated to the passage's content.



Therefore, the most logical and direct answer based on the text is **D**."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekozala na litomba mpo na moto oyo azali kokana kosala kaa na motuka na ye?","The correct answer is **A: Bososoli makasi ya oyo mutuka nay o ekoki kosala te** (Serious problems with the vehicle that you can't fix).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a car breaking down repeatedly (""kokota na motuka...kobanda mobembo"") and being unreliable.** It mentions needing a tow truck (""kobanda mobembo ya molai"") and constant repairs.  The frustration and implication is that the car is fundamentally flawed.
* **The question (Q) asks about what would lead someone to *abandon* a car.**  A car with unsolvable mechanical issues is the most logical reason to abandon it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Motuka oyo epesaka nzela na bakiti ete elala (The car provides a way for people to relax)** - This is the opposite of what the passage describes.
* **C: Hema (Price)** - While price *could* lead someone to abandon a car, the passage focuses on mechanical failure, not cost.
* **D: Oyo ya motu ye moko wapi kosalala kaa (One of your cars where you can camp)** - The passage mentions camping *with* a car, not abandoning one *for* camping.



Therefore, **A** directly addresses the core issue presented in the passage – a broken, unreliable car that's causing problems and is likely to be abandoned."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini batu oyo bazali nak aa na mituka bakoki kolinga kokima soki bazali koluka kotikala na nse ya radar?","The correct answer is **A: Kotambwisa motuka ya monene, lokola SUV to minivan** (Driving a larger vehicle, like an SUV or minivan).

Here's why:

The passage states: *""Camping ya motuka esalemaka soki oza na fourgonnette mingi, SUV moko, berline moko to kopema na bakiti oyo elalisaka.""*  This translates to: ""Vehicle camping works best if you have a van, an SUV, a sedan, or even by attaching a trailer.""  Larger vehicles offer more space for camping and are therefore more suitable for this type of activity.

The question asks what drivers can do to *avoid* being detected by radar while camping. The passage implicitly suggests that larger vehicles are *more* conducive to this type of camping, meaning they're less likely to draw attention (and therefore radar detection) than smaller, more obviously ""camping"" setups.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kosala mobembo molai koleka na nzela** (Making a small fire beside the road) -  This would *increase* visibility and likelihood of being detected.
* **C: Kobongisa hema na engumba to na esika ya moto ye moko** (Setting up a tent in the bushes or on your own land) - This still involves a visible campsite and isn't directly related to avoiding radar.
* **D: Kozanga koyebana na motuka oyo bazali kosalela** (Hiding near the vehicles they are using) - This is illogical and doesn't relate to the passage.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nani atongaki lisusu Casablanca mbala ya mibale?","The correct answer is **D: Mokonzi ya Maroc** (The Sultan of Morocco).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sultan ya Maroc etongaki lisusu engumba wana na nkombo ya Daru l-Badya...""  This directly translates to ""The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city with the name of Daru l-Badya...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baportuguais (The Portuguese):** While the Portuguese *founded* the city as Casa Branca, the text says the Sultan *rebuilt* it.
*   **B: Bato ya mombongo espagnol (Spanish colonists):** They were given the city by the Sultan but didn't rebuild it initially.
*   **C: Mérénides:** They used it as a trading post long ago, but didn't rebuild it in the time frame mentioned.



"
Nani atikalaki na engumba Casablanca ya mikolo na biso nsima ya likama oyo esalemaki na biloko oyo ezalisama?,"The correct answer is **B: Baportuguais**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bato ya Portugal babomaki yango mpe batongaki yango na nkombo ya Casa Branca, na nsima babwakisaki yango nsima ya koningana ya mabele na 1755."" 

This translates to: ""The Portuguese occupied it and named it Casa Branca, and later rebuilt it after the earthquake of 1755."" 

Therefore, the Portuguese were the ones who rebuilt and re-established the city after a significant event. While the Phoenicians, Romans, and Mérénides traded with/controlled Anfa (the earlier name for Casablanca), the passage specifically mentions the Portuguese as the ones who re-established *Casablanca* after the earthquake.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ndenge nini Sintra ayebanaki na bapaya?","The correct answer is **C: Botali malamu ya Lord Byron**.

Here's why:

The text states that Sintra became famous *after* Lord Byron wrote about its beautiful scenery (""abetaki lisolo ya malamu ya kitoko na yango""). The other options are places mentioned in relation to Sintra, but don't explain *why* Sintra gained its fame with travelers.

*   **A: Cabo da Roca** - is a place the Scotturb 403 bus goes to *from* Sintra.
*   **B: Komimonisa ya Maria** - is a religious site near Sintra (Fatima), not a reason for Sintra's initial fame.
*   **D: Ezali nsango y abolingo** - states Sintra *is* a beautiful place, but doesn’t explain how it became known as such.



"
Nini endimami na Arménie te?,"The correct answer is **A: Etúká ya Nagorno-Karabakh**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Kasi, eza te ekolo eyebana - ata kutu Armenie - endimaka yango te."" (But no country – not even Armenia – recognizes it).  ""Yango"" refers back to the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, established with Armenian support. Therefore, the lack of recognition *is* the issue with Armenia's involvement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Etumba oyo esalemaki na ba Azeris:** This is a *result* of the conflict, not the problem with Armenia's position.
*   **C: Baloba ya boyokani ya Azerbaïdjan:** While the conflict *causes* tensions with Azerbaijan, it's not what Armenia doesn't recognize.
*   **D: République ya sika:** Armenia supports the republic, it doesn't have a problem *with* the republic itself, but with its lack of international recognition.



"
Nini ezali kokoba kozala na bopusi likoló na boyokani kati na Azerbaïdjan mpe Arménie?,"The correct answer is **D: region ya Nagorno-Karabakh**.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""Koswana ya bakonzi mpona etuka ezokoba kobebisa boyokani kati na Arménie na Azerbaïdjan"" *because of* the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh. The conflict *over* the Nagorno-Karabakh region is the root cause of the tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ba Arménie oyo bafandaka na Azerbaïdjan:** While Armenians *were* involved in conflict within Azerbaijan, this isn't the underlying *cause* of the broader conflict.
* **B: Etumba ya 1994:**  The 1994 ceasefire is a *result* of the conflict, not the conflict itself.
* **C: Baloma y aboyokani:** This is too general. While there are diplomatic efforts, it doesn’t pinpoint the core issue.



"
"Ntango ozali kozwa taksi na Charlotte, nini ekoki komema na kofuta mbongo mosusu?","The correct answer is **A: Kofanda na esika mosusu** (Going to another location).

Here's why:

The passage states that Charlotte taxis often don't like taking short trips, and instead prefer longer fares. It also mentions the potential for high costs if the ride is short. This implies that a taxi driver might refuse a ride *because* it's not to a more distant location.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kozala na ba voyageurs misato** (Being with other passengers) - The passage doesn't mention anything about sharing rides.
* **C: Kokende na Uptown** (Going to Uptown) - The passage actually says traffic *increases* when going to Uptown.
* **D: Kozala na boninga ya libota** (Being during rush hour) - While traffic is mentioned, it doesn't directly relate to a reason a taxi might refuse a fare.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekoki kotalelama lokola likambo ya mabe ya kofanda na Charlotte elongo na bana?","The correct answer is **D: Koluka kosepela na engumba** (Moving/changing neighborhoods).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""mbala mingi bapaya bamonaka ete engumba wana eza pete na kosepela kuna na bana"" - which translates to ""often people notice that the neighborhood is no longer safe for children."" This directly points to a decline in safety as a major negative consequence.
* **The passage also states:** ""mibu 20 euti koleka, motango ya maponi ebongi na bana na Uptown Charlotte ekoma ebele mpenza"" - which translates to ""in the next 20 years, the increased police presence for children in Uptown Charlotte will become very expensive"". This also points to a decrease in safety.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ntalo ya bandako (Traffic jams):** While traffic is mentioned, it's presented as a logistical problem (cost of parking, needing a car), *not* as a primary negative consequence for children.
* **B: Kozwa taxi (Taking a taxi):**  The passage notes people don't often take taxis, and even when they do, it's expensive. This is a *result* of the problems, not the problem itself.
* **C: Bavandi oyo bautaki na bisika mosusu (Vandals who operate in other cities):** The passage mentions that people from other cities contribute to the problems, but the core issue is the decline in neighborhood safety, not specifically external vandals.



Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is **D: Koluka kosepela na engumba** – people are feeling the need to move because neighborhoods are becoming unsafe for children."
"Liboso ete bato ya Espagne báya, nani azalaki kotambwisa eteni ya nɔrdi ya Chili?","The correct answer is **D: BaInca**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...nordi ya Chili ezalaki na nse ya boyangeli ya baInca..."" (the north of Chile was under the influence of the Inca). 

While the Mapuche and Araucanians fought *against* the Spanish and Incas, the Incas were the ones initially in control of the north.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, kati na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi esalemaki te na 1810?","The correct answer is **B: Chili elongaki ba Espagnols**.

Here's why:

The text states that Chile declared independence in 1810 *during* the Napoleonic Wars which weakened Spain's control. However, it also says that *Spanish rule* wasn't fully overcome until 1818. This means that in 1810, Chile was still under Spanish control – it hadn't yet successfully freed itself *from* the Spanish.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Guvernema ya kati ezalaki te** (There was no central government) - The text doesn't say this. It says independence was *declared* but not yet achieved.
*   **C: Bitumba ya Napoléon ezalaki kosalema** (The Napoleonic Wars were ending) - The text says the wars were *happening* in 1810, contributing to Spain's weakness, not ending.
*   **D: Chili esakolaki lipanda** (Chile had achieved independence) - This is the opposite of what the text says. Independence came later, in 1818.



"
Ndenge nini bato bakoki kokóma na bamboka ya mosika na etúká ya Liguria?,"The correct answer is **C: Na engbunduka to na masuwa** (By train or by boat).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Banzela, bingbunduka mpe masuwa esangisaka bamboka, mpe mituka ekoki kokoma kuna te longwa na libanda."" This translates to ""Trains, boats and buses serve the villages, and cars cannot travel on the roads.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Na motuka to na masuwa** (By car or by boat) - The passage specifically says cars *cannot* travel on the roads.
* **B: Na motuka to na engbunduka** (By car or by train) - Again, cars are not an option.
* **D: Na mpepɔ to na engbunduka** (By plane or by train) - The passage doesn't mention planes.



"
Liloba ya Italien ‘Cinque Terre’ ezali kolobela nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Bamboka mitano**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Cinque Terre, oyo elimbolia Mabele Mitano..."" which translates to ""Cinque Terre, which means Five Lands...""  ""Bamboka"" means lands/villages in this context.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Banzela mitano** - ""Banzela"" means roads, the text mentions roads but doesn't say that's what Cinque Terre *means*.
*   **C: mabanga mitano** - ""Mabanga"" means groups, while related, it isn't the direct translation of Cinque Terre.
*   **D: Mbu mitano** - ""Mbu"" means river, and is not relevant to the meaning of Cinque Terre.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, lolenge nini ya botte ebongi mpo na makambo oyo ekoki kogumbama na eleko ya malili?","The correct answer is **D: Sapato oyo ezangi ezaleli ya bozindo ya 1/5 pouce** (Shoes with a sole thickness of 1/5 inch).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Modele esengeli kozala mozindo, 5 mm (1/5 inch) to mingi, mpe biloko esengeli kozala mwa pete mpona bisika ya malili makasi."" This translates to: ""The model should be thick, 5 mm (1/5 inch) or more, and the soles should be studded to avoid slipping on icy surfaces.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sapato na talons mike** (Shoes with small heels) - Small heels don't address the issue of slipping on ice.
* **B: Sapato na biloko ya sete** (Shoes with smooth soles) - Smooth soles are *more* likely to cause slipping.
* **C: Sapato na talons milayi** (Shoes with high heels) - High heels are dangerous in icy conditions and don't provide stability.



"
"Na kati ya biloko yango, oyo wapi ekosalisa te mpo na kobongisa traction na banzela oyo ezali na glace na ntango ya malili?","The correct answer is **A: Mungwa** (Salt - specifically, calcium chloride).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Mbala mingi zelo, mabanga ya mike to mungwa (chlorure ya calcium) epanzanaka na babalabala to na banzela mpona kobongisa yango.""  This translates to: ""Often salt, small stones and calcium chloride are spread on roads and sidewalks to improve traction.""  The text *specifically* mentions calcium chloride (mungwa) being used to *increase* traction on icy surfaces.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: gravier (gravel):** While gravel *can* be used for traction, the text doesn't highlight it as a primary method for dealing with ice.
* **C: Zelo (sand):**  Sand is mentioned alongside salt, but the text doesn’t explicitly state it *increases* traction; it's just listed *with* the things spread on roads.
* **D: Mayi (water):** Water *decreases* traction on ice, making it more slippery.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekokani mpenza na Hawaii mpe Bisanga Cook?","The correct answer is **D: Bango mibale bazali na bingumba te** (Both places do not have cities).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bisanga Cook eza te na engumba ata moko kasi eza na bisanga 15 ekeseni."" (The Cook Islands do not have a single city, but have 15 islands).  It also implies Hawaii doesn't have cities in the same way, mentioning a lack of hotels and ""luxury things"" like cities would have.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bango mibale bazali na ba otɛlɛ ya minene mingi** (Both places have many large hotels) - The passage specifically contrasts the Cook Islands with Hawaii, stating the Cook Islands *lack* the luxury and hotels found in Hawaii.
* **B: Bango mibale bazali na l’Etat te** (Both places are not a state) - The passage doesn’t discuss the political status of either location.
* **C: Bazali na fuseau horaire moko** (They are in the same time zone) - The passage doesn't mention time zones.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola bisanga ya Cook malamu te?","The correct answer is **A: Ezali moke koleka Hawaii**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lokola baza na ngonga moko na Hawaii, ntango mosusu bato bakanisaka ete bisanga wana """"eza na se ya boyangeli ya Hawaii"""".""  This translates to: ""Because they are in the same time zone as Hawaii, sometimes people think these islands """"are in the shadow of Hawaii"""".""  This implies a negative connotation – being overshadowed or not being recognized *as much* as Hawaii.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ezali bisanga** - The passage clearly states it *is* islands, this isn't a point of being looked down upon.
* **C: Bingumba minene ezali Rarotonga mpe Aitutaki** -  This is a statement *about* the islands, not a reason why they might be underestimated.
* **D: Mboka ya esanga yango ezali na fuseau horaire moko na Hawaii** -  Being in the same time zone isn't a negative thing, it's just a fact.



"
"Na kati ya bisika ya babateli zamba oyo elandi, oyo ya wapi epesaka lolenge mibale ya kopona mpo nae sika ya kolala?","The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sirena eza esika moko pamba oyo babatela zamba oyo ezalaka na bachambre mingi ya kolala pe bilei ya moto pene ya ba camping.""  This translates to: ""Sirena is one of the places where they rent hammocks that are in many rooms for sleeping and near campsites.""

This directly indicates Sirena offers accommodations for sleeping, making it the best answer to the question about where to find lodging. The other options (Los Patos, La Leona, and San Pedrillo) are mentioned as *camping* sites, not places to rent sleeping arrangements.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, wapi okoki kobomba mokanda ya ndingisa ya parke soki olingi kosalela mbongo na esika ya kodefisa mbongo?","The correct answer is **B: Puerto Jiménez**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Okoki kozwa ndingisa ya kokota na parke mbala moko na station Ranger na Puerto Jiménez..."" This directly translates to ""You can get a park permit once at the Ranger station in Puerto Jiménez...""  This is where you obtain the permit if you want to enter the park and pay the fee.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sirena:** Sirena is a campsite, not a place to get a permit.
*   **C: CafeNet El Sol:** CafeNet El Sol offers internet access, not park permits.
*   **D: La Leona:** La Leona is a campsite, not a place to get a permit.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, lolenge nini ya kosala ski esalemaka na bisika oyo ezali na nse mingi?","The correct answer is **D: Kokende na mokongo na nzela ya ski** (Glide down the slope on a ski path).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) specifically mentions:** ""Kotambola na bangomba esalaka na bisika etombwana pe esengaka kozala na banzete ya ski mpe basapatu ebongi."" (Skiing on slopes requires a prepared slope and appropriate ski equipment and boots.)  It also says to ""kokoka kosala bantaka mingi koleka na kotambola – kasi mbala moke, okozala na bavitese ya ski ya makasi kozanga saki ya kilo na mokongo na banzela babongisa."" (Practice making many turns instead of just going straight – but once, be in the ski lift and glide down a prepared slope).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kosala ba-ski (Making skis)** - The passage discusses *using* skis, not making them.
* **B: Ski na nsima ya mboka (Skiing on a city hill)** - The passage focuses on designated ski slopes, not random hills.
* **C: Ndenge ya ngomba Alpe (Alpine slope style)** - While related to skiing, this is a *style* of skiing and isn’t the answer to the question about safely skiing on a difficult slope.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekoki kosalisa bato oyo basalaka ski ya fond, mpe balingi kozala na mbangu koleka?","The correct answer is **A: Sapato ya makasi koleka (Heavy ski boots)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""...mbala moke, okozala na bavitese ya ski ya makasi kozanga saki ya kilo na mokongo na banzela babongisa.""  This translates to ""...sometimes, you'll need heavy ski boots weighing kilos on your head in the paths they show.""  This clearly indicates that heavy ski boots are necessary for backcountry skiing (being in danger/needing rescue).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Saki ya kilo (Kilos of weight):** While the passage *mentions* weight, it specifically refers to the weight *of the boots*, not weight in general as a solution.
* **C: Ndenge ya malamu (Smooth conditions):** The passage states to make *more* turns if conditions are smooth, implying smooth conditions aren't the solution to being stranded.
* **D: Nzela oyo ebongisami malamu (The well-marked path):** Staying on marked paths is a preventative measure, not a solution *after* you're already in trouble.



"
Batu ya kosala mobembo oyo bazuaki choc ya kokota lisusu bazali na ntango Makasi kosala nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Komesana na mimeseno ya esika ya sika** (To respect the customs of your place).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ntango mosusu ezalaka mpasi mingi bazongela lisusu mimeseno na bango ya kala"" (when things are going well, they return to their old customs) and ""ntango ozonga na mboka na yo nsima ya kofanda na mokili mosusu, osengeli komesana na bizaleli ya sika po obungisa bizaleli na yo mosusu ya mimeseno ya mboka na yo"" (when you return to your country after living elsewhere, you must respect the people of your place in order to encourage others with the customs of your country).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kozala na motema molai mpe kososola (Being kind and forgiving):** While being kind is good, the passage focuses on *respecting customs*, not just being nice.
* **C: Kosala mibembo na mboka mopaya (Making commitments in a foreign land):** The passage discusses returning *to* your homeland, not making commitments elsewhere.
* **D: Kozongela komesana na mimeseno na bango ya ndako (Returning to respect their old customs):**  This is *part* of the idea, but it doesn't capture the main point of needing to respect the customs *of your current location* when you return.



"
Nakotala makomi oyo eleki kobanga ya kozonga na ndako ekoki kozala mpasi mingi mingi mpo na lolenge nini ya mobembo?,"The correct answer is **B: Bato oyo basalaka mibembo oyo bamesanaki nokinoki ntango bazalaki kofanda na mboka mopaya** (People who make promises they can't keep when they are leaving a former country).

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""Bato basalaka mibembo oyo bamesanaka noti na mimeseno ya sika, ntango mosusu ezalaka mpasi mingi bazongela lisusu mimeseno na bango ya kala."" This translates to ""People make promises they can't keep regarding their situation, and often return to the promises of their past."" This highlights the tendency to make unrealistic promises when *leaving* a country.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't mention a ""shock of bad luck"" (""choc ya bonkoko mabe"").
* **C:** The passage doesn't limit promise-making to only times of desperation after a disaster (""komisepelisa nsima ya libala"").
* **D:** While the passage implies some lack of sincerity, it's not specifically about people lacking goodwill (""motema molai mingi te"").  The focus is on the broken promises related to migration.

"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi bato basengeli koboya kosala na moose?","The correct answer is **C: Kozongisa nan se nivo ya likama na bango oyo ekoki kozala** (Check the level of decay and if it can cause illness).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** If people can't identify spoiled meat like a professional, they risk getting sick by eating it, even if it smells okay.  This directly relates to checking the level of decay (how spoiled it is) to avoid illness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kokip ate na kozala na bango** (It's okay to be with them) - This is irrelevant to the problem of spoiled meat.
* **B: Kopusana penepene na malembe mingi** (Eat a little at a time) - Eating a little spoiled meat doesn't make it safe; it just means you might get sick more slowly.
* **D: Kotala bango na mosika** (Sell them at the market) - Selling spoiled meat is dangerous and unethical.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na maloba oyo elandi oyo etali elan, oyo wapi ezali solo te?","The correct answer is **B: Ntango mosusu batalelaka yango te lokola likama oyo ekoki kozala.**

Here's why:

* **P's statement** explains a situation where people avoid eating a certain kind of meat (elk) because they're worried it's been poisoned.  It then says that if people don't recognize the meat as dangerous, they might eat it alongside other meat and get poisoned along with it.
* **Q's question** asks *where* the danger lies – what makes this situation happen?  It's asking for the root cause of the problem.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bazali banyama oyo basalaka nkanda na ndenge ya bomoto** (They are animals that cause trouble like fire) - This is irrelevant to the poisoning issue.
* **C: Bato oyo bazalaki penepene na bango nde bakokaki kosala yango** (Those who were close to them could do it) -  This implies someone deliberately poisoned the meat, which isn’t stated in P. The passage is about *recognizing* poisoned meat, not *who* poisoned it.
* **D: Bakomibatela soki esengeli** (They report it if necessary) - This talks about reporting, not the source of the danger.

**Option B** directly addresses the core issue:  people *don’t* treat it like regular meat (likama) because it *can* be dangerous (ekoki kozala).  This is why they avoid it and why it's dangerous if others don't know that.  



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekozala likama mingi te mpo na moto oyo azali kosala mobembo na esobe?","The correct answer is **A: Kozanga bilamba ya molunge na butu ya malili** (Accepting the illusion of water in the desert).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes the dangers of mirages in the desert.** It says people lost in the desert might *see* water (bisika) that isn't real, and pursuing it can lead to their demise. It emphasizes that denying the illusion (not giving in to the desire for it) is crucial for survival.
* **Question (Q) asks what's *most* dangerous for someone lost in the desert.**
* **Option A directly addresses the core message of the passage:**  Believing the illusion of water (molunge) in the harsh desert (butu ya malili) is what leads to trouble.  It's about succumbing to the false hope.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Komona mirage oyo epesaka illusion ya mayi** (Seeing the mirage that creates the illusion of water) - Simply *seeing* the mirage isn't the problem, it's believing it.
    * **C & D: Kobebisa nguya/mayi ntango ozali kolanda mirage** (Believing in water/the illusion when you're looking at a mirage) - These are too specific. The passage isn't about *when* you believe, but the act of believing itself.  Option A is broader and more accurately reflects the overall danger.



Therefore, **A** is the best answer because it captures the central warning of the passage."
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi elobelami te ete ekoki kozala likama mpo na bato oyo basalaka mibembo na esobe?","The correct answer is **C: Hypothermie**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes symptoms of prolonged exposure to cold:** The text talks about people getting sick, shivering, and potentially dying from cold exposure, especially if they don't have adequate shelter or warm clothing. These are all hallmarks of hypothermia.
* **Hypothermie (Hypothermia) is the medical condition of having a dangerously low body temperature.** The passage directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kozanga mayi (Drowning):** The passage doesn't mention water or drowning.
* **B: Makanisi (Malnutrition):** While lack of resources *could* lead to malnutrition, the primary focus is on the *cold* and its immediate effects.
* **D: Kozika na moyi (Suffocation/Asphyxiation):**  While dangerous conditions *could* lead to suffocation, the passage specifically focuses on the effects of cold.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, batu ya etuluku nini bazuaki makambo mingi koleka nsima ya kokoma ya batu ya kosala bolukiluki?","The correct answer is **C: Tainos**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Longola mabongo ya zelo ya pembe mpe ya kitoko ya bangomba, mboka wana eza na engumba ya kala mpenza ya Eropa na Amerika, sikoyo eza na kati ya Saint-Domingue. Bato ya liboso bafandaki na esanga wana eza ba Taínos na Caribes...bato ya Espagne oyo babotolaki mbongo bakitisaki mingi mpenza talo ya ba Tainos."" 

This translates to: ""Before the arrival of Europeans and the subsequent colonization, the land was inhabited by the Taínos and Caribes...the Spanish colonists greatly reduced the population *compared to* the Taínos.""

The passage explicitly mentions the Taínos suffered a significant population decline due to the arrival of the Spanish, meaning they were the original inhabitants who experienced the most devastation. Therefore, they are the ""people of the past"" who suffered greatly after the arrival of the colonizers.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, monoko nini bato ya Caraïbes bazalaki koloba?","The correct answer is **D: Arawakan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bato ya liboso bafandaki na esanga wana eza ba Taínos na Caribes. Caribes ezalaki mboka ya bato oyo balobaka lokota ya Arawakan...""  This directly translates to: ""The first inhabitants of this island were the Taínos and Caribs. Caribs were a people who spoke the Arawakan language...""

Therefore, the Caribs (and Taínos) spoke Arawakan.



"
Nani bakoki koloba ete akómisaki bato mingi kosala ski lokola mosala ya kominanola?,"The correct answer is **A: Bato ya mobulu na ski** (People of the past/ancient people who ski).

Here's why:

The text states: ""mayemi ya mabulu oyo eza na bato bazosala ski ebanda banda na 5000 liboso ya ntango na biso!"" (the origins of skiing with people who skied go back 5000 years!). This directly links the practice of skiing to ancient peoples.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Norvégiens** - While Norway is heavily associated with skiing, the text mentions a ski club being *founded* in Norway in 1861, not that they *started* skiing.
*   **C: Bato oyo bafandaka na mabulu** - This is a bit vague and doesn't specifically connect to the origin of skiing.
*   **D: Australiens** - The text only mentions Australia in relation to a ski club founded *in* 1861, alongside Norway, not as the originators of the sport.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, pene na ngonga nini lisano ya ski eyebanaki mpo na mbala ya liboso lokola lisano?","The correct answer is **C: 1861**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""na 1861, bafungolaki ekipe ya liboso ya masano ya ski na bato ya Norvége na Australie.""  This directly translates to ""in 1861, the first ski competition was organized by Norwegians and Australians.""  This indicates that a formalized, competitive form of skiing (like a competition) began in 1861.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 18ème siècle (18th century):** While skiing existed before this, the text doesn't link the *organized competition* to the 18th century.
*   **B: 5000 BC:** The text mentions skiing going back 5000 years, but this refers to the *origins* of skiing, not the start of competitions.
*   **D: 17ème siècle (17th century):**  Similar to option A, the text doesn’t tie the competition specifically to the 17th century.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi esanganaka mingimingi na esanga oyo eleki monene oyo ezali pembenipembeni ya libongo ya est ya afrique?","The correct answer is **A: influence européenne**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that European powers (Portugal specifically, with Vasco da Gama) began to arrive in the 15th century and establish trade routes. It also mentions former French colonies. This points to a significant and long-lasting European influence in the East African region.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Esika ya baislamu (Islamic influence):** While the passage *mentions* Arab control of Kilwa and its presence in the Comoros and Mayotte, it doesn't portray this as the *most* significant overall influence, particularly in the context of the region's historical development as described.
* **C: Banyama ya zamba (Ancient civilizations):** The passage does not focus on ancient civilizations.
* **D: Esika ya kitoko mpenza ya opema (Original indigenous settlements):**  The text focuses on outside influences *coming* to the region, rather than detailing the original settlements.



"
Nini ezali ezaleli ya bisanga mikemike te na Afrika ya est? ,"The correct answer is **D: Lipanda na bikolo mosusu** (Influence from other countries).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bisanga ebele ya mike ezalaka bikolo ezwa lipanda, to ezalaki na boyokani na France, pe eyebani na nkombo ya mabongo ya motuya."" This translates to: ""The history of East Africa is due to the influence of countries, or was in connection with France, and was influenced by the Bantu people.""

Therefore, the passage directly identifies the influence of other countries as a key factor in the history of East Africa.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Boyokani na France** (Connection with France) - While France *is* mentioned as a connection, it's not the *sole* source of influence. The passage highlights influence from multiple sources.
*   **B: Bisika mingi kitoko mpenza ya kopema** (Many beautiful beaches) - The passage doesn't mention beaches.
*   **C: Lokumu mpo na banyama ya zamba** (A place for wild animals) -  While East Africa *has* wild animals, this isn't the historical origin mentioned in the text.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ndenge nini Pasika esalemaka na mangomba mosusu mingimingi ya bonkoko?","The correct answer is **B: Koyamba butu ya bokengeli na mokolo ya Mposo** (Starting the preparations on Palm Sunday).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""bandako-nzambe ebele ya kala basalaka fete ya Pake na mokolo ya poso na butu na wikende ya Paki...""  This directly translates to ""Old believers used to celebrate Easter on Palm Sunday with preparations during Holy Week.""  Palm Sunday marks the beginning of Holy Week and the preparations for Easter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kosala molulu ya kobota** (Performing a ritual of repentance) - While repentance is part of the Lenten season leading *up* to Easter, the passage doesn't specifically mention a ritual.
* **C: Kosala feti ya printemps mpo na lisanga** (Celebrating a spring festival for reading) -  The passage connects the celebration to Christian beliefs, not a general spring festival.
* **D: Kotala ndenge moyi ezali kobima** (Understanding how life is changing) - This is too vague and doesn't relate to the specific information in the text.

"Mpo na koboya masengami mosusu ntango azali kokota na Équateur, mwana mboka ya Cuba asengeli liboso kozala na nini?","The correct answer is **A: Passeport oyo ezali na mosala mpo na sanza 6 koleka mikolo ya mobembo** (Passport that is valid for at least 6 months after the date of entry).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Passeport na yo esengeli kozala na ngala mpona basanza ata 6 koleka badate ya mobembo na yo."" This directly translates to ""Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months after your date of entry.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mokanda ya libyangi oyo epesameli mibeko** (Document proving financial means) - While financial means are likely needed, the text doesn't specifically mention this as a *requirement* for the visa itself.
*   **C: Ticket ya kokende mpe kozonga mpo na kolakisa bolai ya kofanda** (Round trip ticket to prove intention to leave) -  The text mentions a ticket for travel but not specifically as proof of intent to leave.
*   **D: Carte verte ya États-Unis** (US Green Card) - The text states Cubans with a US Green Card *must* go to the Ecuadorian consulate for a check, but the Green Card itself isn't the requirement for the visa process.



"
Masengami ya mobembo ya Équateur ebongisami mpo na nini te?,"The correct answer is **A: Kobatela motongo ya bato oyo basalaka mibembo mingi te** (To prevent people from making too many trips).

Here's why:

The text states the Ecuadorian minister ordered checks on those entering the country, *especially* those arriving via flights with many Cuban citizens.  The requirement for a ""carte verte"" and checking passport validity (at least 6 months remaining) are all measures to **control and limit the number of entries**, particularly by those potentially trying to exploit loopholes for extended stays or illegal immigration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kobatela ndenge ya batu ya kokota oyo ebongisami:** The text focuses on *who* is entering (Cubans with certain documentation) rather than *how* they are entering generally.
* **C: Kondimisa bolai ya kofanda ya motu oyo asali mobembo:**  This relates to visa fees, which isn’t mentioned in the text.
* **D: Koyeba mpenza ntango passeport etikali kosala:** While passport validity is checked, the *reason* for the check isn't simply to see *when* it was issued, but to ensure it's valid for a sufficient duration, indicating a limited stay.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kosenga mbongo mingi na mboka mopaya koleka na ndako?","The correct answer is **B: Montures ya likolo** (Frameworks of life).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bakadre ya kitoko ya likolo ezali na bisika oyo ekoki kozala na makambo mibale; mosusu ekoki kozala ya mabe, mpe ya solo eza oyo euta mikili mosusu kasi ekoki kozala talo mingi koleka oyo basala na ndako.""  This translates to: ""Good life frameworks are based on systems that can have good things; others can be bad, and the sole thing that adds more value is what they do in practice.""

This directly implies that the *frameworks of life* (how things are structured and operated) are where the greatest potential for wealth (or negative consequences) lies, exceeding even things like exams, insurance, or orders.  The passage highlights that the *implementation* within those frameworks is key to success.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kotala miso miso** (Examining the heart/mind) - While the passage mentions exams, it doesn't suggest they generate significant wealth.
* **C: Assurance ya miso** (Life Insurance) - This provides security, but the passage suggests something with greater potential for wealth.
* **D: Montures oyo ezali na nkombo te** (Frameworks without contracts) - The passage focuses on *good* frameworks, not the lack of contracts.



"
Nini ekoki kozala likama oyo ekoki kobima soki ozali kosomba ba cadres ya lokumu na mboka mopaya?,"The correct answer is **C: Ekoki kozala ya malamu (It could be a misfortune)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) describes a situation where a company is laying off employees (""bafutaka bato ya mosala mbongo moke"") despite conducting medical exams, having insurance, and even obtaining legal orders. It highlights that while these measures are taken, layoffs can *still* happen and can be difficult.  The passage emphasizes the potential for both good and bad outcomes, but leans toward the possibility of negative consequences (""makambo mibale...mabe"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ekoki kosenga basala ekzame mosusu ya miso (They might ask for another medical exam):** The passage already states they *did* medical exams.  More exams aren't the primary risk.
* **B: Ordonnance ekoki kosala te mpo na bamonture mosusu (The order can't be used for further layoffs):** The passage doesn't say the order is ineffective, only that they obtain one.
* **D: Ekoki kozala ete assurance ekoki kofuta mbongo yango te (It could be that insurance won't cover that expense):**  The passage mentions insurance, but the core issue is job loss, not insurance coverage.

Therefore, the most logical consequence of this situation, given the text's emphasis on potential hardship, is that it could be a misfortune (""ya malamu"").



"
"Na oyo etali kosalela mbongo na Malouines, na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali solo?","The correct answer is **D: Longola mbongo ya Falkland, mbala mingi livre ya Angleterre ezali mbongo oyo endimami mingi.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bandimaka livres sterling na bisika nyonso na bisanga wana, na crédit Stanley, mpe mbala mingi bandimaka badolare ya Etats-Unis."" (They accept livres sterling at all shops, with Stanley credit, and often accept US dollars.) This directly supports the idea that while dollars are *sometimes* accepted, the British pound (livre ya Angleterre) is the most commonly used currency.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage says credit/debit cards aren't widely accepted, so this is wrong.
* **B:** Stanley accepts dollars, but it's not the *only* place, and the passage implies pounds are more common.
* **C:** The passage states you can exchange Falkland pounds *at* the bank, not that you *need* to exchange them *before* shopping.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ntango ozali kosala mobembo wuta États-Unis kino Malouines, wapi lolenge mosusu ya kofuta longola kaka karte ya kredi ekoki kozala na ntina mingi?","The correct answer is **A: Na magasin ya FIC West**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Okoki kobongola mbongo kaka na banke moko ya bisanga wana oyo ezali na Stanley na ngambo ya FIC West store."" (You can only exchange money at one bank in Stanley next to the FIC West store).

Therefore, the FIC West store location is specifically mentioned as the place to exchange money.



"
Likambo nini ezali na boyokani te na fɛti ya bafɛti ya tempelo?,"The correct answer is **A: Mbotama ya nzoku** (Family problems).

Here's why:

The passage states festivals are held to commemorate the temple, a deity, or *other significant events within the temple's sphere*.  It specifically mentions elaborate celebrations with musicians and performers, suggesting things *related to the temple itself* are welcomed.  

Family problems (mbotama ya nzoku) wouldn't be a focus of a temple festival – they aren't part of the temple's direct sphere of commemoration.  The other options (temple issues, god's issues, important things about the temple) are all things that *would* be relevant to a temple festival.

Therefore, family problems are the least likely thing to be celebrated *during* a temple festival.



"
Epai wapi tokoki komona banzoku oyo ba decorer?,"The correct answer is **B: Na batempelo** (In temples).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Batempelo ebele ezala na fete oyo basalaka mbala moko na mbula banda na suka ya sanza ya zomi na moko kino na katikati ya sanza ya mitano..."" (Temples hold festivals once a year between December and May...) and then describes the decorations (""banzoku oyo bakomisi kitoko, orchestre ya tempelo mpe bafete mosusu"") being *part of* these temple festivals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bisika nyonso kobanda na suka ya sanza ya zomi na moko kino na katikati ya sanza ya mitano:** This states the *time* the festivals happen, not *where* you see the decorations.
* **C: Namilulu na feti ya tempelo:** This refers to the *occasions* for the festivals (anniversaries), not the place where the decorations are.
* **D: Na balabala ya Kerala:** While Kerala temples are mentioned, the decorations aren't specifically said to be *on* the Kerala buildings themselves, but *within* the temples.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that a good way to finance a class action lawsuit (or a large claim) is to ""kopesa mbongo mingi mpona kozwa libaku wana (to, malamu koleka, osengi kompani na yo esala yango pa na yo)"" - which translates to ""lend a lot of money to get the claim (or, better yet, use your own company to pay for it)."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kozua esika ya liboso olie ya mombongo** (Finding a location for the lawsuit that's cheap) - The passage doesn't suggest location impacts financing.
* **C: Zua esika liboso na mpepo oyo ezali ya mbala moko te** (Finding a location that's not in a large city) -  Similar to B, location isn't the focus of financing.
* **D: Koluka kokitisa ntalo** (Looking to settle quickly) - While settlement is a goal, the passage doesn't link it to *how* to finance the lawsuit.



Therefore, **A** is the only option directly supported by the text as a method of funding a large claim."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekozala kolekisa ntango mpamba mpo na koluka ntango ozali kozua esika na mpepo ya bakelasi mosusu ya ntalo?","The correct answer is **A: BMpepo ya mbala moko** (One-time fee).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mbala mingi, esengaka kutu te kosenga bakitisa talo esika babengaka ya bato ya mombongo to na esika ya bokonzi pa na bampepo ya mbala moko banda na A kino na B.""  This translates to: ""Often, it's preferable not to charge a fee where they advertise for people with money or in service areas on a *one-time fee* basis from A to B.""

The passage discusses avoiding charging a fee *in those specific contexts* (advertising for wealthy individuals or service areas), suggesting a one-time fee structure is common in those scenarios and should be considered when pricing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Esika ya mombongo (Wealthy area):** While the passage mentions wealthy areas, it's not the core concept of what to consider when pricing.
* **C: Kokitisa ntalo (Charging a fee):** The passage actually discusses *avoiding* charging a fee in certain circumstances.
* **D: Esika ya liboso (Prime location):**  The passage doesn't focus on prime locations as a key pricing consideration.

Nini esengeli te kobakisa na kati ntango ozali kokokanisa devis ya tarif total na Afrika na tarif ya mokili mobimba?,"The correct answer is **A: Ntalo ya ba visas ya kobakisa mpo na bisika oyo ezali libanda ya Afrika** (The cost of obtaining visas for flights within Africa).

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions: ""Kobosana te kobakisa mosolo ya likolo mpona ba viza, bampako ya kokende, transport pe bongo na bongo mpona bisika yonso libanda ya Afrika.""  This translates to ""Don't forget to factor in the cost of visas, airport taxes, transport, and inter-country travel within Africa.""

Therefore, when comparing total costs, the cost of visas *within* Africa is a crucial factor to consider, especially when comparing to flights outside of Africa.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ntalo ya palata ntango ya kobima na Afrique** (The cost of payment when booking in Africa) - While there might be payment fees, it's not a primary cost differentiator mentioned in the text.
* **C: Ntalo ya visa na Afrique** (The cost of visas in Africa) - Too broad. The passage is about *obtaining* visas *for travel between African countries*.
* **D: Ntalo ya transport na mabele mpo na bisika oyo ezali libanda ya Afrika** (The cost of ground transportation for flights within Africa) - While ground transportation is mentioned, the visa costs are more significant and directly affect the overall fare comparison.

"Na kotalela makomi oyo eleki, bazando ya minene babandi kopesa koleka na lolenge ndenge na ndenge?","The correct answer is **A: Bilei oyo esili kobongisama** (Food that is reheated).

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states that large meals often consist of reheated food (""Kosomba bilei na talo malamu""). It then goes on to describe *how* they're reheated - in microwaves, ovens, or simply warmed up.  The question (Q) asks *how* these large meals are often prepared.  Reheating is the common thread.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ba foure ya micro-ondes** (Microwave ovens) - While microwaves are *a way* to reheat, they aren't the defining characteristic of all large meals.
* **C: Ndako ya kolia na esika yango** (Eating place/location) - This doesn't relate to *how* the meal is prepared.
* **D: Ntalo kitoko** (Good price) -  Price isn't mentioned in relation to how the meals are prepared.



"
Biloko nini ya malamu oyo bamagazini mosusu ya minene epesaka ekoki kosepelisa kiliya oyo azali kosomba bilei oyo esili kobongisama?,"The correct answer is **B: Mpo na oyo ekeseni mingi te** (For those who don't have much).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""...bazalaka na malewa ata moko, mbala mingi ezalaka oyo eza na bilei ya talo malamu."" (They have even just one, often it's the same as cheap bread.) This directly implies that large stores offer affordable options, *especially* for those who don't have much money.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndako ya kolia na esika yango** (A place to eat there) - The passage doesn't discuss eating *at* the store.
* **C: Bilei ya mbindo** (Frozen bread) - While the passage mentions some bread is baked, it doesn't focus on frozen bread being a solution for those who can't afford better.
* **D: four à micro-ondes moko** (A microwave oven) - The passage mentions microwaves as a way people heat bread, but it doesn't suggest they are *offered* by the stores to help people.

"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kososolama te na bato ya Belgique mpe ya Suisse oyo balobaka Francais?","The correct answer is **A: Système ya kokoma motango ya français ndenge esengeli** (The correct system of French pronunciation).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the way French is pronounced in Belgium and Switzerland *differs* from the way it's pronounced in France, and that these differences are often noticeable when people from these regions interact with French speakers from France. It also mentions that people in Belgium and Switzerland learn French *in class* and therefore might be unaware of how it's *supposed* to be pronounced. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maloba ya français ya kokamwa (French vocabulary used):** While there might be slight vocabulary differences, the passage focuses on *pronunciation* not vocabulary.
* **C: Ndenge ya kobenga maloba mosusu ya français (How to use other French expressions):** This is related to vocabulary and phrasing, not the core pronunciation.
* **D: Bato balobaka français mingi na France (Many French speakers in France):** This is irrelevant to the problem of understanding differences in pronunciation.



Therefore, the main issue causing potential misunderstanding is the differing *system of pronunciation*, hence option A is the correct answer."
"Na kati ya makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali ndenge moko te na France na oyo ezali na Belgique to na Suisse?","The correct answer is **B: Système ya motango** (Pronunciation system).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mingimingi, ndenge ya kokoma mintango na Belgique oyo balobaka Francais pe na Suisse eza na mwa bokeseni oyo eza ndenge moko te na Francais balobaka na France…""  This translates to: ""Often, the way of pronouncing words in French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland is in a way that is different from how French is pronounced in France…""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndenge ya kobenga maloba nionso** (The way of inventing all words) - The passage talks about *how* words are said, not inventing new ones.
* **C: Français ya solo eteyamaka na biteyelo** (French that is only used in lessons) - The passage says people *use* the French they learn, it doesn't suggest it's limited to lessons.
* **D: Ndenge ya kokoma ba mots mosusu ya français** (The way of using other French words) - While there might be some vocabulary differences, the passage focuses on *pronunciation*.

Na likambo nini mbala mosusu bakopesa yo mbongo ya mobembo mpo na liwa?,"The correct answer is **B: Soki omeki kozua esika mbala moko na kopanyi ya mpepo na olie ya mosala ya eteni ya misato** (If you had to change your flight date with the airline at the last minute).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Na bandakisa nyonso, osengeli kokanga esika mbala moko na kompani na nzela ya telefone na yo."" (In all cases, you need to contact the company once by phone.)  This directly implies that changing your flight (re-booking) is a situation where you'd need to contact them.  The passage links this to receiving a refund.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Soki ozali kopumbwa na mpepo WestJet** (If you are bumped from a WestJet flight) - While being bumped *could* lead to compensation, the passage doesn't specifically mention this as a trigger for needing to contact the airline.
* **C: Soki ozali kosala mpepo Lufthansa kouta Paris ti na Etats-Unis** (If you are taking a Lufthansa flight from Paris to the United States) - This is just a flight itinerary; it doesn't necessitate contacting the airline.
* **D: Soki ozali kopumbwa Delta** (If you are bumped Delta) - Same reasoning as A. Being bumped isn't the focus of the passage's explanation of when you'd contact the airline.

Nini ezali solo na ntina na mbongo ya mobembo mpo na liwa?,"The correct answer is **D: Esengeli kosala réservation mbala moko na site internet ya kopanyi ya mpepona nzela ya téléphone.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Na bandakisa nyonso, osengeli kokanga esika mbala moko na kompani na nzela ya telefone na yo."" This directly translates to ""In all cases, you need to book a place with the company by phone.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bazali kofuta mbongo ya mobembo ya matanga** (They are refunding ticket money) - The passage doesn't mention refunds.
* **B: Esengeli kosala réservation mbala moko na site internet ya kopanyi ya mpepo** (You need to make a reservation once on the airline's website) - The passage specifically states booking by *phone*.
* **C: Bazali kofuta mbongo ya mobembo na miniti ya nsuka** (They are refunding ticket money in the last minutes) -  Again, the passage doesn't mention refunds or timing.

Ntango nini kosalela aparɛyi ya GPS oyo ezali yango moko ekozala malamu koleka programɛ ya kosala na nzela ya GPS?,"The correct answer is **A: Ntango ozali koluka kobomba mbongo** (When you are trying to avoid paying).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ekoki kosalisa na kobomba mbongo soki ozosomba bakarte ya sika mpona GPS..."" (It can be used to avoid paying if you bypass the GPS card...).  This directly links using a separate GPS device to the intention of avoiding fees.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ntango oyebi mpenza ete okozala na ndenge ya kozua nsango** (When you feel like you are going to get lost) - While a GPS *could* help with getting lost, the passage doesn't connect a separate device to this situation.
* **C: Ntango ozali kokende libanda ya portée** (When you are losing signal) -  The passage mentions signal issues as a reason why the separate GPS might be *needed* (if your phone's GPS isn't working), not why it's *malamu* (wrong/bad) to use.
* **D: Ntango olingi ko louer appareil te** (When you don't want to rent an device) -  This is irrelevant to the ethical/legal issue discussed in the passage.



"
Nini ezali ntina malamu te ya kosalela appli ya navigation GPS na bokeseni na aparɛyi oyo ezali yango moko?,"The correct answer is **B: kobomba mbongo** (paying money).

Here's why:

The passage (P) directly states: ""Ekoki kosalisa na kobomba mbongo soki ozosomba bakarte ya sika mpona GPS..."" which translates to ""It can cost money if you download detailed GPS maps...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Esengeli te komitungisa mpo na ndenge ya kozua nsango** (You don't need to worry about how to find your way) - The passage doesn't say this. It highlights *potential problems* with using the app, not that it eliminates the need for navigation skills.
* **C: Kokima bisika ya kofutela** (Having a desire to travel) - This is unrelated to the drawbacks of using the app.
* **D: Kozala na mposa ya kosomba bacarte ya sika te** (Not being able to download maps) - The passage states it can be a problem *if* you can't download maps, but the main drawback mentioned is the *cost* of the maps themselves.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ndenge nini okoki kopesa ndanga ete bakokanisa yo na masuwa oyo ebongi?","The correct answer is **C: Réservation na motu oyo ayebi mpenza mobembo Galapagos** (Reservation with a tour operator who knows the Galapagos well).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the limited capacity of the boats (8-100 people) and the popularity of the Galapagos.**  Getting a spot requires planning.
* **The passage specifically mentions wanting someone who *knows* the Galapagos and the regulations around the cruises.** A knowledgeable tour operator is key to navigating these constraints.
* **Options A, B, and D are too vague.**  Reserving in advance (B & D) is helpful, but doesn't guarantee a spot *on a boat that complies with regulations*.  Reserving for 8+ people (A) doesn't address the core issue of finding a suitable and legal cruise.

Therefore, a tour operator with Galapagos expertise is the most effective way to secure a place on a compliant cruise.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi esalelamaka te lokola mayele mpo na kobatela bapaya bábɛta masano ya mbongo?","The correct answer is **A: Ebele ya pole ya bozalisi** (Lack of regulatory oversight).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes casinos exploiting players.** They offer enticing games (ngonga mpe mbongo), have poor visibility of the odds (bafenetre na bamontre ezalaka te), and are often located in places that encourage gambling (bilei, masanga). The overall theme is a predatory environment.
* **The question (Q) asks what allows this exploitation to happen.** It's asking for the *reason* casinos can take advantage of gamblers.
* **Regulatory oversight (ebele ya pole ya bozalisi) is the key missing element.**  If there were strong rules and enforcement, casinos would be less able to manipulate games, hide information, and prey on people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Makambo lokola babillet ya kobeta nzembo ya ofele (Things like advertising to bet with money):** Advertising contributes to the problem, but it's a *result* of the lack of regulation, not the core cause.
* **C: Masanga ya ofele (Bad luck):**  Bad luck is a part of gambling, but the passage emphasizes *manipulation* by the casinos, not just random chance.
* **D: Kozanga bamontre (Hiding windows/views):** This is a tactic *used* by casinos, but the question is asking what *allows* them to use that tactic without consequences.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate and logical answer. It directly addresses the underlying condition that enables the exploitative behavior described in the passage."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, mosani ya masano ya mbongo ya mayele asengeli kokima nini?","The correct answer is **D: Kotuna na ntina ya esika ya kobima oyo ezali penepene** (Focus on the location of the betting area that is nearby).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes casinos being designed to keep people gambling.** They lack windows, have confusing layouts, and are often located near entertainment to encourage continued play.  The key is they *make it hard to leave* and *easy to keep betting*.
* **Question (Q) asks what should be done to improve gambling odds.**  The passage implies that the *environment* is manipulated to encourage gambling. Therefore, being aware of and focusing on the layout of the betting area (knowing where it is, being aware of its proximity) is the most logical response, as it's about understanding the designed manipulation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Komela masanga mingi** (Play more games) - This is *what the casino wants you to do*, not a way to improve your odds.
* **B: Kondima ba incentives nionso** (Accept all incentives) - Incentives are also designed to keep you playing; they don't improve odds.
* **C: Kotala ba horloges to ba montres** (Remove clocks and watches) - While the passage mentions the lack of windows and time awareness, *removing* them yourself doesn't change your odds. The casino controls that aspect.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, eteni nini ya elobeli ekomami na makomi minene na katikati ya phrase?","The correct answer is **B: Bankombo**.

Here's why:

The prompt (P) explicitly states ""Bankombo nyonso, ata pe ya liloba Sie mpona yo, ebandaka na majuscule, ata na katikati ya phrase."" This translates to ""All nouns, even those in the 'You see' phrase, begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of the sentence.""

The question (Q) asks what is typically found in the middle of a phrase and capitalized according to the prompt.  Nouns (Bankombo) are the only option that fits this description.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bverbes (Verbs):** Verbs don't typically start with a capital letter mid-sentence.
*   **C: Baadjectifs (Adjectives):** Adjectives describe nouns and also don't start with a capital letter mid-sentence.
*   **D: Ba-adverbes (Adverbs):** Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs and also don't start with a capital letter mid-sentence.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekokaki kosala ete kokoma bankombo na makomi minene ezala mpasi mingi?","The correct answer is **B: Kokesenisa kati na baverbe**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt (P) describes a situation where words are capitalized randomly, even mid-phrase.** This is a clear indication of a grammatical error related to how verbs are used.  The prompt also mentions issues with verbs and adjectives fitting correctly within a sentence.
* **""Kokesenisa kati na baverbe"" (To mix up with verbs)** directly addresses the core problem – incorrect verb usage and potential confusion about verb forms, which would lead to random capitalization as a symptom of deeper grammatical issues.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Kotanga (To write)** - While writing is involved, the problem isn't simply about *writing* but about *incorrectly* writing due to grammatical errors.
* **C: kokoma (To arrive/come)** - This has no logical connection to the problem described.
* **D: Kokesenisa kati na biloko (To mix up with things)** -  ""Things"" is too broad. The issue is specifically related to grammatical elements (verbs and adjectives).



Therefore, the most accurate answer relating to the described errors is **B**."
"Na bamboka ya Malaisie, geste nini elimboli “koya likolo”?","The correct answer is **B: Koningisa loboko**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Na Malaisie, ata na kati ya bato ya Malaisie oyo bafandaka na bamboka, elimboli """"yaka,"""" ndenge moko na bilembo ya misapi basali ezotala ndambo ya nzoto, elembo oyo basaleka na mikili mosusu ya poto, pe basengeli kosalela yango kaka na ntina wana.""  This translates to: ""In Malaysia, even among Malaysians who play football, the gesture 'yaka', like a symbol of hands making a net, is used, a gesture they leave out of other polite situations and must only use in that context.""

The passage then connects this ""yaka"" gesture to a greeting, implying it's a hand gesture.  ""Koningisa loboko"" means ""shaking hands."" While the passage doesn't *explicitly* say ""yaka"" *is* shaking hands, it’s the closest and most logical option given the context of a gesture used in football and a greeting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kogumba mosapi ya kolakisa:** This translates to ""folding hands to show respect"" - not mentioned in the text.
* **C: Mbote na loboko likolo:** This translates to ""hello with a big hand"" - doesn't fit the described gesture.
* **D: Kopesa misapi minene na likolo:** This translates to ""giving big hands at the goal"" - while related to football, it's not the specific gesture described as a greeting.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, geste nini ekoki kolimbola “kozonga”?","The correct answer is **C: Koningisa na loboko na loboko etali libanda** (Touching palms together).

Here's why, based on the text (P):

* **The text describes a Malaysian custom:** Even among Malaysians who shake hands, the gesture is called ""yaka,"" similar to how other cultures have different greetings.
* **""Yaka"" is used for offering good wishes:** It's described as a handshake *to give greetings* (kopepa loboko ya kopesa mbote) and *to receive greetings* (loboko ezotala moto apesi mbote).
* **""Kozonga"" is linked to ""yaka"":**  The text explicitly states that ""yaka"" *can mean* ""kozonga"" - a return gesture.
* **The description of ""yaka"" aligns with touching palms:** The text mentions it's a gesture often used instead of other greetings, and connected to ""marking respect"" – this is typically done by pressing palms together.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Koningisa loboko na loboko etali na kati** (Touching hand to hand in the middle) - This is too vague and doesn't specifically match the description of a traditional greeting.
* **B: Kogumba mosapi ya mibale** (Bowing your head) -  The text focuses on hand gestures, not bowing.
* **D: Koningisa mutu** (Touching a person) - This is overly broad; the text is specific about *how* hands are touched.



Therefore, **C** is the only option that accurately reflects the described gesture of ""yaka"" and its meaning of ""kozonga"" (returning the greeting)."
"Na kotalela oyo eleki,  nini esalaka ete mabele epasuka?","The correct answer is **C: Mabulu ya glace oyo ezali kokweya** (Ice blocks that are melting).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Esalaka ete mabele epasuka, ebimisaka mabulu, oyo bagbagba ya neige oyo ekoki kobomba yango mpo emonana te."" This translates to ""It shows that the ground is cracking, creating holes, due to the melting of ice blocks, the accumulation of snow that can no longer hold it.""

Therefore, the melting ice blocks are directly causing the ground to crack.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gbagba ya mbula-mpembe** (Rain accumulation) - While rain might contribute, the passage specifically points to melting ice.
*   **B: Baglacier oyo ezali makasi te** (Glaciers that aren't strong) - The passage doesn't focus on the strength of glaciers, but on the *melting* of ice.
*   **D: Mabanga oyo ekangami te** (Trees that don't grow) - Trees are not mentioned as a cause for the ground cracking.



"
"Kolandana na bokomi, oyo wapi kati na yango ekoki kobombama na gbagba ya mbula-mpembe?","The correct answer is **B: Mabulu ya glace**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*bifelo na likolo ya mabulu ya glace ekoki kokwea mpe bisika efungwama ekoki kokangama.*"" This directly translates to ""...*they melt in the heat of ice cubes and even the wrapper can get wet.*""  The passage is discussing how ice cubes (mabulu ya glace) melt and contribute to the messiness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bipasuka:** This refers to things breaking apart, not the melting process.
*   **C: Bifelo:** This refers to wrappers, which *get* wet from the melting, but aren't the source of the melting.
*   **D: Mabanga ya minene:** This refers to large pieces, which are described as falling and getting messy, but aren’t directly responsible for the melting.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, bato oyo basalaka mibembo basengeli kosala makambo mosusu liboso ya kokende na esika nini?","The correct answer is **A: Volcan ya Nyiragongo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Na 2002, soi ya volan Nyiragongo oyo ekundaki babalabala mingi ya engumba Goma, ebebisaki yango, mingimingi na ville."" (In 2002, the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano which nearly engulfed the city of Goma, caused a lot of damage to the city).  It also mentions Goma being located near Nyiragongo.

The passage further states that anyone wanting to travel to Goma needs to be aware of the situation in North Kivu, implying the volcano is a significant factor in that situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bitando oyo ezali zingazinga ya Goma (The surroundings of Goma):** While relevant, the passage doesn't specifically say travelers need to check *those* before traveling.
* **C: Na katikati ya engumba (In the center of the city):** The passage doesn't mention needing to check the center of the city.
* **D: Rwanda:**  The passage mentions Rwanda in relation to the conflict, but not as a place to check before traveling to Goma.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekozala toli malamu te mpo na touriste na Goma?","The correct answer is **A: Bitumba na Nord-Kivu ezali kosepelisa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Engumba eza mpe esika ya komata na volcan ya Nyiragongo na mwa bangomba ya minkomboso ya talo moko mpenza ya Afrika."" and ""Na 2002, soi ya volan Nyiragongo oyo ekundaki babalabala mingi ya engumba Goma, ebebisaki yango, mingimingi na ville."" This highlights the instability and danger posed by the volcanic activity and general unrest in the Nord-Kivu region.  This makes it a potentially unsafe place for tourists.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ezali esika malamu mpo na Mountain Gorilla Tracking na talo moke:** While the area *is* near gorilla tracking locations, the passage focuses on the *dangers* of the region, not its attractions. It doesn't imply safety for tourism.
* **C: Bataxi ya moto ezali lolenge malamu ya kotambola:** The passage mentions *boda-bodas* (motorbike taxis) simply as a method of transportation, not as a safe or reliable option.
* **D: Esika mpenza ya volcan ya Nyiragongo ezali na engumba:** The passage *states* the volcano is close, but being close to an active volcano is a *risk*, not a positive attribute for tourism.



"
Ntango nini ndingisa ya nsima ya mboka mpo na mokolo ya kobanda na sanza ya mwambe ekobanda kozwama?,"The correct answer is **A: 1 sanza ya yambo janvier**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yango wana, ndingisa ya kotonga na bamboka ya date nyonso oyo ebandi na sanza ya mitano ekomonana banda mokolo ya 1 sanza ya yambo.""  This translates to: ""Thus, reservations for all dates in January begin on January 1st.""

Therefore, reservations for February 1st would open on January 1st. ""Sanza ya yambo"" means January, and ""janvier"" is simply January in French, confirming the answer.



"
Politiki nini ezali mpo na kobatela ngomba?,"The correct answer is **A: Système ya ndingisa ya koya liboso, oyo akozwa liboso** (The reservation system, which is lottery-based).

Here's why:

* **The passage clearly states:** ""Kofanda nyonso na nse pene ya Grand Canyon esengaka kozwa liboso ndingisa na mboka."" (All campsites inside the Grand Canyon require a lottery reservation). This directly indicates a lottery-based system for securing reservations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ndingisa ezali kaka na 1 sanza ya yambo** (Reservations are only on January 1st) - This is false. The passage states reservations for the *following* January open on the 1st of the previous December.  Plus, it mentions reservations for the *entire* following January to May.
* **C: Mikanda ya ndingisa ekoki kozwama kaka na nzela ya aosengi ya kokota** (Reservation applications can only be made by older people) - The passage does *not* mention age restrictions.
* **D: Motango moke ya mikanda ya ndingisa** (Only one reservation application) - The passage does mention a limit of one application per person, but this doesn't define the overall reservation *policy*.

"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kozwama mingi te na lolenge ya ba otɛlɛ oyo elobelami na mokapo yango?","The correct answer is **D: Bisika ya kolala oyo euti kobongisama sika na bibongisi ya mikolo oyo.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Midele ya kala, modele ya kozanga biloko euti kobima sika, pe mwa mibange ya bonzenga baza pe na bato oyo basangani.""  This translates to ""Old customs, the model of building things was expensive, and with the influence of Europeans, it also came with people who understood [construction].""  This clearly refers to the *cost* of building and maintaining these hotels, and how it could become unsustainable (""kobongisama sika"" - becoming expensive) with changing times and influences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Esika ya masanga (Location of construction):** The passage doesn't focus on *where* these hotels were built, but *how* and *why* they changed.
* **B: Esika ya kolia oyo eyebani (The place where they ate well):** While the hotels offered good food and comfort, this isn't the main problem discussed.
* **C: Baninga bapaya oyo bayebani malamu (Paying customers who were well-treated):** The passage mentions the comfort and service, but doesn’t indicate this is where problems arose.

"Na kotalela makambo oyo mapesami na mokapo, makabo nini kati na makabo oyo elandi, bapaya ya hotel bakotya na esika ya liboso mingi te?","The correct answer is **C: Esika ya kofanda oyo epesaka bosepelisi ya butu** (The location for gatherings that offered a pleasant atmosphere).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bahotel ezalaki bisika oyo bazwi na bato ya lokumu bazalaki kofanda, mpe mbala mingi ezalaki na bilei kitoko mpe bomoi malamu na butu.""  This translates to ""Hotels were places known by local people for gatherings, and often had a beautiful and healthy atmosphere.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Biloko ya ndako ya kala na esika mobimba** (Old buildings in a specific location) - While the hotels *were* old, the passage doesn't focus on the buildings themselves, but their function and atmosphere.
* **B: Esika ya kolia oyo ezali na molambi moko ya lokumu** (A dining location owned by a single local) - The passage doesn't mention ownership or primarily focus on dining.
* **D: Ntalo ya esika ya kolala ezali malamu** (The terrain of the location was good) - The passage doesn't discuss the physical terrain.



Therefore, the key reason hotels were popular and attracted many people was the *atmosphere* they provided – a place for pleasant gatherings and a good quality of life."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini esengeli koboya na bato oyo bazali kosala mibembo oyo bazali kokende kotala Greenland?","The correct answer is **B: Komema bilamba ya kilo, lokola klima ezalaka mingimingi molunge mbula mobimba** (Be prepared for the weather, as the climate is extremely cold for many months).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly warns about the harsh climate of Greenland.** It states that if you travel to Greenland, especially the north, the weather will be very cold and can cause many illnesses and difficulties. It also mentions needing to dress warmly and be prepared for strong winds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bisika mosusu oyo eyebani mpo na motango monene ya mbeba** (Another cost for the large amount of baggage) - While baggage costs might be a factor, the passage doesn't emphasize this.
* **C: Kozela kosala ntango ozali kuna, lokola bokangamy ya internet ekoki kozala maba** (Be prepared to be bored, as internet access can be bad) - The passage *does* mention good internet access in Greenland (93% connectivity), so this isn't a primary concern.
* **D: Kolobelaka moto moko ya mboka Greenland lokola “Eskimo”** (Calling someone from Greenland ""Eskimo"") - The passage strongly discourages using the term ""Eskimo"" as it's considered offensive.  It’s a point the passage is *against*, not something to prepare for.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kozala mokakatano mingi mpo na bato oyo bamibongisi te oyo bazali kokende kotala Greenland?","The correct answer is **A: Ngongi ya mikili ya Nord** (The cold of the North).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Soki okei kotala Groenland na bileko ya malili (yeba ete soki ozokoba kokende na nord, malili ekozala makasi koleka), eza ntina malamu komema biloko ya molunge.""  This translates to: ""If you go to Greenland in the cold season (note that if you go north, the cold will be very strong), it is a good thing to wear warm clothes.""

The passage highlights the extreme cold as a significant challenge, particularly for those not accustomed to it.  The other options are not directly linked to the difficulties of traveling to Greenland as described in the text:

* **B: Mbeba (Fear)** - While fear might be *a* reaction, the text focuses on the *physical* challenges.
* **C: Mopepe (Loneliness)** - Loneliness is mentioned as a potential outcome for those who are isolated, but not as a primary obstacle.
* **D: Batu ya mboka (People of the country)** - The passage discusses the local people (Inuits/Kalaallit) and their preferences regarding terminology, but doesn't identify them as a *problem* for travelers.



"
"Na oyo elandi, oyo wapi esalelami sikawa lokola esika ya monene ya katikati?","The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sikoyo ezosala lokola esika monene ya plaza"" which translates to ""It serves as a large site in the plaza."" This directly describes the Jardín de la Unión.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Balabala ya Beze (Callejon del Beso):** This is described as a very narrow alley.
*   **C: Tempelo ya San Diego (Templo de San Diego):** The text states this *is located* within the Jardín de la Unión, but doesn't describe it as the large central site.
*   **D: Allée ya kopesana ba bisous:** This is a translation of ""Callejon del Beso"", and also describes a narrow alley.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezwami te na Jardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **D: Ndako moko ya kala ya couvent** (A former site of a convent).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Jardín de la Unión... kasi eloko etikali kino lelo oya ndako wana eza kaka Templo de San Diego."" This translates to ""Jardín de la Unión... but what was there before is now only the Temple of San Diego.""  The Temple of San Diego is built on the site of a former 17th-century convent.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Esika ya katikati libanda oyo ezali na baconcert** (The central location where concerts are held) - This describes *a feature* of the garden, not what *was* there before.
*   **B: Ndako ya lisolo ya bolingo ya kala** (A place of old love promises) - This refers to Callejon del Beso, a different location within the area, not the garden itself.
*   **C: Bisika ya kolia oyo etali elanga** (A narrow street that is sunny) - This also refers to Callejon del Beso.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi oyo elobeli kotambola na bangomba mokolo moko ekotalelama lokola ya sikisiki te?","The correct answer is **D: Kotambola na bangomba na mokolo ezali mosala oyo ebongi te na libándá mpo na mabota oyo ezali na bana mike.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ekoki kosenga ete mabota oyo eza na bana ya mike bamibongisa mingi, kasi bakoki kolekisa mokolo moko na libanda ata soki baza na babebe pe bana bakoti naino kelasi te.""  This translates to ""It can happen that the tasks for young children are very demanding, but they can complete one day in the schedule even if they are with their parents and children don't go to school."" This directly addresses the difficulty of scheduling work with young children and suggests it's *not* ideal for a single day.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While simplifying things is helpful, it doesn't address the core issue of balancing work with childcare.
* **B:**  This talks about effort, but doesn't relate to the passage's point about scheduling difficulties.
* **C:**  This discusses the *ability* of older children to cope, but the passage focuses on the challenges with *young* children.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ntango nini kotambola na bangomba ya mokolo moko esɛngaka komibongisa mpenza moke?","The correct answer is **A: Ntango moto oyo azali kotambola na bangomba azali nzoto kolongono** (When the person traveling with groups is tired).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mpona mokolo ya kotambola na nzela moko ya pete, komibongisa moke eza ntina pe moto nyonso oyo abongi moke akoki kosepela na yango."" This translates to ""After a day of traveling a short distance, being tired is important and anyone who wants to can rest in it.""  Traveling with groups (bangomba) often leads to quicker fatigue. The passage emphasizes the importance of rest when *tired*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ntango esɛngaka nzela ya kotambola oyo ezali facile koleka** (When the route is easy) - The passage doesn't link ease of travel to the need for a break.
* **C: Tango bana bazali kokende kotambola** (When children are starting to travel) - While the passage mentions children, it doesn't specifically say breaks are needed when *starting* to travel.
* **D: Tango kotambola ezali na environnement plus naturel** (When traveling in a more natural environment) - The passage doesn't mention the environment influencing the need for a break.



"
Nini ekeseni na bisika ya plateau na Rogaland to na Agder soki tokokanisi yango na mikili mosusu ya Norvège?,"The correct answer is **D: Mbala mingi, ezipaka yango na ba bruyères.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Na Rogaland pe na Agder, babengaka bango mbala mingi """"hei"""" oyo elimboli nzela ezangi banzete oyo mbala mingi ezalaka na babruyère."" This directly translates to: ""In Rogaland and Agder, they often call them """"hei"""" which means a path that is flat and often located in heather (bruyère).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bazali na banzete** (They are flat) - While the passage mentions they *are* flat, it doesn't highlight this as a distinguishing feature of Rogaland/Agder plateaus.
* **B: Babongo ezali te** (They don't have them) - The passage clearly states they *do* have plateaus in these regions.
* **C: Ba plateaux ezalaka mingi** (There are many plateaus) - The passage doesn't say there are *more* plateaus in these regions compared to others, just that they have a specific characteristic.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, kati na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekozala ya momeseno te mpo na Norvège?","The correct answer is **D: Mabwaku**.

Here's why:

The text describes *fjords* (mabwaku) and *plateaus* (vidde/hei) as characteristic of the Norwegian landscape. The question asks what wouldn't be expected in Norway based on the text. While the text mentions landscapes and features, it doesn't talk about forests (bitando ya mabele), valleys (babwaku oyo ezali na bazamba) or tribes (babongo ya mabanga). 

Therefore, **mabwaku** (fjords) are *specifically* mentioned as a defining characteristic of Norway, making it the answer that *would* be expected, not the one that wouldn't.  The question asks for what *wouldn't* be expected. This is a slightly tricky phrasing.
"
Ntango nini ba touristes oyo balingi kosala ski basengeli kokende na ba gares ya bangomba?,"The correct answer is **A: Na ntango ya malili** (In the winter).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...bisika mingi na bangomba ezalaka na neige mingi mpe esalisaka na kosala misala neti ski na snowboard."" (Skiing and snowboarding are popular because there is a lot of snow on the slopes.)
* Snow is most abundant in the **winter**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Na ntango ya eleko ya eleko ya nse** (During the autumn elections) - This is irrelevant to skiing conditions.
* **C: Na ntango yam oi makasi** (During the rainy season) - Rain doesn't create good skiing conditions.
* **D: Na ntango ya printemps** (In the spring) - Snow melts in the spring, making skiing difficult.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, mbala mingi ntango nini baturiste bazalaka mingi na bisika ya kozela ya bangomba?","The correct answer is **A: Na ntango ya ba bouts ya neige makasi** (During times of heavy snowfall).

Here's why:

* **P** states the ski resort is very crowded, *especially* when there's a lot of snow (""neige mingi"").  This directly links to times of heavy snowfall attracting more tourists.
* **B** focuses on snowboarding, but the text mentions both skiing *and* snowboarding being popular during crowded times.
* **C** (""Na ntango yam oi makasi"" - During warm weather) is the opposite of what the text implies – snow is needed for skiing and snowboarding!
* **D** (""Na basanza nionso ya eleko ya malili"" - At all times of the beginner slopes) is too specific. The crowding happens overall, not just on beginner slopes.



"
Nini osengeli koboya kosala soki ozali na elikya ya kozwa masuwa oyo ezali koluka lisalisi?,"The correct answer is **B: Kosala boninga na ba capitaines.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a situation where someone is working in marinas, helping with boats, and generally assisting with mooring.**  The key detail is the need to interact with boat owners (""bakokabola basango"") and help them with their boats.
* **""Kosala boninga na ba capitaines"" (Making connections with the captains/boat owners)** directly addresses this need.  It's about building relationships with the people who control the boats, which is essential for getting tips (masuwa) and opportunities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kotambola likoló mpe na nse na ba quais (Walking around the docks and on the quays):** While being visible is helpful, it doesn't guarantee tips or work.
* **C: Kosakolala misala na yo (Bragging about yourself):**  This is unlikely to lead to getting tips; it's more likely to be off-putting.
* **D: Kozanga koyeba baninga oyo basalaka autostop ya masuwa (Looking for people hitchhiking for boats):** This is irrelevant to the described scenario of working in a marina.



Therefore, building relationships with the captains/boat owners is the most logical and directly relevant action to take to maximize tips in this situation."
Nini osengeli kosala zingazinga ya ba marinas ntango ozali koluka masuwa oyo ezali na mposa ya lisalisi?,"The correct answer is **A: Sala boyokani na bato oyo basalaka na masuwa** (Communicate with people who are on boats).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) clearly emphasizes the importance of interacting with other boaters.** It talks about meeting others, helping with mooring, asking for and offering assistance with lines, and generally being part of the boating community.  The whole point is about how things go smoothly when you connect with people.
* **Let's look at why the other options are wrong:**
    * **B: Tikala na nse ya radar** (Look at the radar) - While radar is useful for navigation, it doesn’t directly address the social aspect and help described in the passage.
    * **C: Bopusana penepene na bato kaka tango bazali kosukola yacht na bango** (Stay close to people only when they are fixing their yacht) - The passage describes interactions beyond just repairs.
    * **D: Bokima baninga oyo basalaka kotelemisa mituka** (Hire people who are good at steering boats) -  This is irrelevant to the advice given in the passage.



The passage's focus is on *relationships* and *communication* within the marina environment to make things easier and more enjoyable for everyone.  Therefore, interacting with other boaters is the most appropriate answer."
Esika nini ekosepelisa motamboli oyo asepeli na makambo ya kala y aba oyo bakonzaki esanga?,"The correct answer is **A: Libongo ya Nord** (North Shore).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bokoli mingi ba bamboka ba esanga ya Hong Kong etonda mpenza na mabele oyo ezalaka na ndambu ya nordi ya libongo."" which translates to ""Many of Hong Kong's colonial buildings are concentrated on the shores of the north shore.""

The passage directly links the historical presence of the British colonizers and their buildings to the *ndambu ya nordi ya libongo* (north shore). The other options are mentioned in the text but aren't connected to the colonial history.



"
Esika nini ekosepelisa mopaya oyo atyaka na esika ya liboso bisika ya kotala ya kokamwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Libongo ya Victoria**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...bakokanisi yango na foto ya kitoko ya bare oyo ezomonana polele mpona mai kitoko ya libongo ya Victoria."" This directly translates to ""...they compare it to a beautiful picture of the shore that overlooks the beautiful waters of Victoria Harbour.""  This establishes Victoria Harbour as the key landmark associated with the beautiful view that attracts visitors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hong Kong mpenza:** While Hong Kong itself is beautiful, the text specifically refers to a view *of* Hong Kong, not Hong Kong as the attracting element.
* **C: Esanga ya Hong Kong:** The island of Hong Kong is mentioned, but it's the view *from* the island, overlooking the harbour, that's emphasized.
* **D: Libongo ya mayi ya Kowloon:** Kowloon is mentioned as a place to walk *to* get a view, but isn't the focal point of the scenery itself.



"
Nini mabulu ya punda mosusu ezali na yango mpo na kosalisa mpo na kokitisa likama ya lokolo ya mokumbi mpunda kokangama na motambo?,"The correct answer is **B: Mabende ya libateli** (Shoe laces).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...esengeli kozwa mwa bibongiseli ya libateli."" ( ""...it is necessary to use shoe laces""). This directly relates to preventing the shoe from becoming loose and the heel from slipping out.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Matambe ya mikemike** (Small stones) - These are not mentioned in the text as a feature of the shoe.
*   **C: Bitanda ya poso** (Footbeds) - While footbeds are part of shoes, they aren't specifically mentioned as a solution to the heel slipping.
*   **D: Bokasi monene koleka** (Large box separately) - This is irrelevant to the description of the shoe.



"
Eloko nini ya botte ya komata esalisaka mpo na kobakisa libateli ya mokumbi motuka ntango azali kosalela bitanda?,"The correct answer is **B: cuir**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Na nsima, bakiti mosusu, mingimingi bakiti ya baAnglais, eza na banzete ya libateli oyo esalisaka eloko moko ya **cuir** na kokwea na kiti soki babendi yango na nsima na momemi-mpunda oyo ezokwea."" 

This translates to: ""Later, other soles, often English soles, were made with a piece of **leather** to reinforce the shoe when bending it at the heel-counter.""  The leather (cuir) provides the support needed when the heel bends.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: semelle moko ya mabe mpe ya moke (a sole made of bad and rough material):** The text mentions rough soles earlier but doesn't link them to supporting the heel.
*   **C: talon moko (a single heel):** While heels are mentioned, the text focuses on reinforcement *during* bending, not the heel itself.
*   **D: Litambe ya monene (a large strap):** Straps aren't mentioned in the context of supporting the heel.



"
Nini Lisanga ya boyambi epesaka basali mobembo?,"The correct answer is **C: Kotala esika epesami na batambwisi ya mboka** (Finding accommodation with local hosts).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the platform helps people **find places to stay** (""kokende kotala"") with locals (""bana mboka"") in different locations (""bingumba"").  This is the core function described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bisika ya kolala na bayambi ya mboka** (Bicycles with local hosts) - The passage doesn't mention bicycles.
* **B: Ba vols ya talo moke** (Cheap flights) -  The passage mentions Casey Fenton wanting to go to Iceland, but the platform's function isn't about finding cheap flights.
* **D: Boyokani na bato mosusu ya mobembo oyo bakendaka na esika moko** (Meeting other travelers who are in the same place) - While this *might* happen as a result of using the platform, it's not the primary function described.



"
"Na kotalela eteni yango, na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi oyo etali ba réseaux d’échange hospitalité ezali solo te?","The correct answer is **C: Bakopesa bato oyo bazali kosala mibembo liste ya bato oyo bakoki koyamba bango na engumba oyo bakokende.**

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Bapesaka liste ya bayambi na nsima na papie to na ordinatere, ezalaka na bankombo mpe makanisi na bato mosusu oyo bazalaki kosala mobembo."" (They provide a list of hosts on paper or computer, linked with comments and recommendations from other travelers.) This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bapesaka ntango nyonso bato oyo basalaka mibembo ba références mpo na bayambi ya mboka** - While references are *part* of the system, the passage emphasizes the *list* itself.
* **B: Ba réseaux misusu ekoki kosenga vérification ya kobakisa ya ba voyageurs** - The passage doesn't mention other networks or verification processes.
* **D: Maloba ya bapaya ya mboka epesamaka ntango mosusu mpo na batu ya mobembo** - The passage doesn't discuss payment or how it relates to travelers.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, lolenge nini ya mopaya oyo akoki kozwama mingi te na shambre ya auberge oyo bato bakabolaka?","The correct answer is **B: Invité moko oyo azali kosala mobembo ye moko** (A guest who is having their own party).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""mbala mingi okoki pe kokuta mikolo oyo basali mibembo kuna."" (often you can also hear the parties they are having there).  It then contrasts this with other hotels that put those groups in single rooms. This implies the problem is *guests having parties* in the hotel rooms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mopaya oyo azali na mbula ntuku mibale na ebandeli** (A guest who has several bags at the beginning) - While possible, this doesn't explain why the hotel might be problematic.
* **C: Mopaya oyo azali kosala mobembo elongo na bana mike** (A guest who is having a long party with many children) - While potentially disruptive, the passage focuses on the *act* of having a party, not the length or who's involved.
* **D: Mopaya moko oyo azali na mbula ntuku misato** (A guest who has three bags) - Again, this isn't the core issue the passage describes.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nani azali na likoki mingi ya kofanda na auberge?","The correct answer is **D: Mabota mibale bazali kosala mobembo elongo na bana na bango.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ba hotel ya bilenge ezalaka mingimngi mpona bilenge – mbala mingi bakiliya bazalaka na mibu 20 na ndambu – kasi mbala mingi okoki pe kokuta mikolo oyo basali mibembo kuna. Mabota oyo eza na bana bakutanaka na makambo..."" (Hotels often have large families – often guests are in groups of 20 or more – but you can also find days they spend money there. These are families gathering for things...)
* **The question asks:** Who is most likely to spend money at the inn/hotel?
* **Option D** directly reflects the information in the passage: *large families* are the ones described as spending money at the hotels.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** A couple making a long trip is not mentioned as a significant spending group.
* **B:** A group of 22-year-olds isn't specified in the passage.
* **C:** An elderly couple isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola na bosikisiki kobwaka boomerang?","The correct answer is **A: Ekozonga ntango nyonso na lobɔkɔ na yo soki babwaki yango malamu.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Eza malamu mingi mpona bato ya sika na komeka te komibwaka na mopepe."" (It's very dangerous for unskilled people to try to throw it themselves.) This directly implies that *if* someone skilled throws it for you, it can return.  ""Lobɔkɔ"" means skill/expertise.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ezali kosepela mingi na bato ya mboka koleka batouriste:** The passage doesn't mention popularity or difference between locals and tourists.
* **C: Ba boomerangs ezali mingi te na Australie:** The passage specifically states ""Baboomerangs ebele oyo ezalaka na Australie..."" (Good boomerangs are in Australia...).
* **D: Kaka ba boomerangs mosusu nde ekoki kozonga:** The passage focuses on the difficulty of throwing *this* type of boomerang and doesn't suggest other boomerangs return easily.



"
"Na biloko oyo elandi, oyo wapi esalelamaka mingimingi na bilei ya Java?","The correct answer is **D: Sukali ya motane** (Sugarcane).

The text states: ""...le sukali (mingimingi sukali ya coco ya Javanais)..."" which translates to ""...sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar)..."" and then mentions sugarcane as a common ingredient used in flavoring Javanese food.  ""Motane"" is sugarcane in Lingala.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sukali ya pembe:** (Beet sugar) - Not mentioned in the text.
*   **B: Sukali ya mputulu:** (Palm sugar) - While palm sugar is used in Indonesia, the text specifically highlights *Javanese* coconut and sugarcane sugar.
*   **C: Sukali ya mbila:** (Unknown - doesn't translate to a common sugar type) - Not mentioned in the text.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ndenge nini maladi oyo ezwamaka na bato epalanganaka?","The correct answer is **D: Kopesa mangwele** (Transmission/Spreading).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) clearly states:** ""Maladi oyo epanzanaka eza maladi oyo ekoki kopesama na moto mosusu soki aza pene ya moto oyo aza na maladi wana.""  This translates to ""A contagious disease is a disease that can be transmitted to another person if they are near the person who has the disease.""  This directly refers to how the disease *spreads*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bato oyo bazali na bokono (People who are carriers):** While carriers *can* spread disease, the question asks *how* diseases spread, not *who* spreads them.
* **B: Bamicrobe oyo epesaka maladi (Microbes that cause disease):** These *cause* the disease, but don't explain *how* it gets from one person to another.
* **C: Bakteri (Bacteria):**  Bacteria are a *type* of pathogen, but again, doesn’t explain the method of transmission.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini eyebani te ete epesaka bokono ya kozwama?","The correct answer is **A: Kopesa mangwele** (Spreading the disease).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a contagious disease:** It explicitly states the disease ""ekoki kopesama na moto mosusu soki aza pene ya moto oyo aza na maladi wana"" - can spread to another person if they are close to someone with the disease.
* **The question (Q) asks what *doesn't* help spread the disease.**
* **Let's look at the options:**
    * **A: Kopesa mangwele (Spreading the disease)** - This *is* how the disease happens, so it's not something that prevents it.
    * **B: Bavirus (Viruses)** - Viruses *cause* the disease, they don't prevent its spread.
    * **C: Bakteri (Bacteria)** - Bacteria *cause* the disease, they don't prevent its spread.
    * **D: Mayebo (Parasites)** - Parasites *cause* the disease, they don't prevent its spread.

Therefore, spreading the disease is the action described *as* the disease happening, not a prevention method.



"
Ntango nini okoki kopona proxy web na esika ya oyo apesaka VPN ya yo moko ekokoka mpo na mosaleli?,"The correct answer is **C: Mosaleli azali na libosokopesa nzela lisusu ya trafic http**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt describes a VPN that handles *all* internet traffic**, not just HTTP. It specifically says it handles everything ""biloko nyonso na Internet"" (everything on the internet).
* **A web proxy only handles HTTP traffic.**  If the VPN is already handling all traffic, the reason to use a web proxy in addition would be to *redirect* HTTP traffic through a different route.  This is what ""libosokopesa nzela lisusu ya trafic http"" means - to offer a different route for HTTP traffic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mosaleli alingi kobalisa nzela nionso:** This is too broad. The VPN is already handling all routes.
* **B: Mosaleli azali komibanzabanza mpo na koboya bopekiseli mpe kolanda na sekele na ndenge ekoki:** This talks about difficulty/skill, which isn't the *reason* someone would use a web proxy *with* a VPN.
* **D: Mosala ya mosali esengaka nivo ya bande passante ya moyenne to ya likolo:** Bandwidth requirements don't explain why you'd combine a VPN and a web proxy.



"
"Nakotala oyo eleki, na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi oyo etali ba VPN mpe baproxy web ezali solo te?","The correct answer is **A: BaVPN epesaka mingi bande passante ya likolo koleka Baproxy web** (VPNs generally offer better bandwidth and faster speeds than web proxies).

Here's why:

* **The passage highlights a key difference:** It states the VPN ""ezalaka na nzela ya koleka to bande passante pe misala ya kitoko koleka"" (has a way to be faster in bandwidth and speed).  This directly contrasts with the limitations of web proxies.
* **Web Proxies limitations:** The passage explains web proxies primarily handle *http* traffic and don't cover all internet traffic. This means they have limited scope compared to a VPN.
* **Let's look at why the other options are wrong:**
    * **B:** The passage *specifically* states proxies don't redirect *all* web traffic, making this incorrect.
    * **C:**  The passage doesn’t suggest proxies are *better* than VPNs in terms of speed, quite the opposite.
    * **D:** The passage states VPNs can handle more than just http traffic, rendering this incorrect.



Therefore, option A accurately reflects the information provided in the passage about the superior bandwidth and speed capabilities of VPNs compared to web proxies."
Nini epesaka moto nzela ya kosalela kompanyi ya telefone na libanda ya esika oyo azali penepene na ye?,"The correct answer is **D: Batelefone ya PSTN**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mbala mingi, osengeli kosomba nimero oyo ekabwana mpenza oyo epesaka batelefone PSTN likoki ya kobenga yo.""  This translates to ""Often, you need to dial a long-distance number provided by a PSTN phone line in order to reach you.""

The passage explains that getting internet in remote areas often requires using a traditional phone line (PSTN) to establish a connection, even to access internet services like satellite.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kobenga na intenrtoyo elekisami:** (Direct internet access) - While the goal is internet access, the passage says you *need* the phone line *to get* that access in remote areas.
*   **B: Mitango ya telefone ya mokili mobimba:** (Expensive phone calls) - The passage doesn't focus on the *cost* of the calls, but the *necessity* of them.
*   **C: Basatellite:** (Satellites) - Satellites are a *method* of getting internet, but the passage says you still need the phone line to connect to them.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekoki kosalema mpo na kozwa mabiangi mosusu?","The correct answer is **A: Somba numero ya mokili mobimba** (Call a different number).

Here's why:

The passage explains the difficulty of getting a local number online, especially in remote areas. It mentions needing to call a specific number (a ""gatekeeper"" number) associated with the traditional phone system (PSTN) to potentially get a number in the desired area.  The question asks what you can do to get *another* connection. Calling a different number is the suggested solution implied by the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Salela kompanyi moko ya telefone oyo ezali na esika ofandi** (Use a phone company in your area) - The problem described is *getting* a local number, not necessarily using a local phone company once you have one. The passage implies local companies might not be able to help.
* **C: Zwa numero moko epai ya bato ya mboka na bino** (Get a number from someone in your country) - This doesn't address the issue of needing a local number for a specific location.
* **D: Somba telefone ya PSTN** (Call a PSTN phone) - While the passage mentions PSTN, simply calling *a* PSTN phone doesn't solve the problem of obtaining a local number. You need to call a *specific* number within the PSTN system, as the passage suggests.

"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi elimboli na bosikisiki te ndenge oyo maloba ya Italien ebengamaka?","The correct answer is **A: r mibale ebengamaka ndenge mosusu na r moko**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Italian pronunciation often *doubles* the 'r' sound (rr) to create a different sound than a single 'r'.  This is the key difference highlighted in the example with ""caro"" and ""carro"".  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maloba mingi ebengamaka ndenge ekomami** - While Italian does have many words, the passage focuses on a *specific* pronunciation difference.
* **C: Maloba oyo ezali na balɛtrɛ c mpe g ekoki kozala na mayele mabe** - The passage mentions 'c' and 'g' but focuses on their placement *before* vowels, not potential errors.
* **D: Ndenge ya kobenga maloba mingi ekeseni na kotalela mongongo oyo elandi** -  This is too general. The passage details a specific pronunciation rule, not just how to pronounce many words.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ya Izmir ebandaki liboso ya mikolo na biso?","The correct answer is **B: Bandako oyo ezali na talatala liboso** (Buildings with historical facades).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Baboulevards ya minene, bandako oyo bifelo eza na talatala pe bisika ya koteka ya mikolo oyo eza na bandako ya kala ya tuile ya motane..."" This translates to ""Wide boulevards, buildings with facades and historical monuments that are in the old tile streets..."" 

This directly points to the historical buildings with facades as being a prominent feature showcasing Izmir's past.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baboulevard ya minene** (Wide boulevards) - While mentioned, it doesn't specifically highlight what *shows* the history.
*   **C: Bisika ya kosomba biloko** (Places to shop) - The text mentions markets, but doesn't focus on them as showing the city’s history.
*   **D: Bansamba ya ndako oyo etiami batwili ya motani** (Remains of buildings that have twins of the past) - This isn't directly stated in the text.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali ezaleli ya sikisiki ya Izmir te?","The correct answer is **B: atmosphère ezali komonisa Turquie traditionnelle** (the atmosphere reflects traditional Turkey).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...eza zingazinga ya libongo mpe ezingami na bangomba. Baboulevards ya minene, bandako oyo bifelo eza na talatala pe bisika ya koteka ya mikolo oyo eza na bandako ya kala ya tuile ya motane, zando ya ekeke ya 18 pe bamosquées na bandako-nzambe ya kala..."" (It's full of history and charm. Wide boulevards, buildings with detailed facades and historical clocks, 18th-century mansions and old mosques...) This describes elements of traditional Turkish culture and architecture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Engumba yango ezingami na libongo moko monene** (The city has a single major characteristic) - This is too simplistic. The passage describes many characteristics.
* **C: Okoki kokuta bisika ya kosomba biloko ya mikolo oyo mpe ba eglises ya kala** (You can find historical clock towers and old churches) - While the passage *mentions* clock towers, it doesn't mention churches.  It specifies mosques.
* **D: Ezali na libongo ya mibale ya monene na Turquie** (It has a large population in Turkey) - The passage states the population, but that's a *fact* about Izmir, not its unique characteristic or feeling.  Many Turkish cities have large populations.



"
Liloba hanami ezali kolobela kotala nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Fololo ya cerisier** (Cherry blossoms).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...oyo eyebani na nkombo ya hanami..."" (which refers to the cherry blossom viewing, hanami) ""...ezalaka na kati ya bizaleli ya bato ya Japon bandana ekeke ya 8."" (and is associated with the 8th century in Japan) and then continues to describe the *cerisier* (cherry tree) blossoms.  Hanami is *about* enjoying the beauty of cherry blossoms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Batu minene ya Japon** (Many Japanese people) - While hanami *involves* many Japanese people, it's not *what* hanami is.
* **C: Bafololo ya prunier** (Plum blossoms) - The passage mentions plum blossoms as a precursor in China, but hanami specifically relates to cherry blossoms in Japan.
* **D: Esika ya bokonzi** (Place of worship) - The passage doesn't connect hanami to a place of worship.



"
Nani ayambaki bafeti ya liboso oyo epesamaki mpo na kotala bafololo ya cerise?,"The correct answer is **B: Batu minene ya Japon** (The people of Japan).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Na Japon, bafete ya liboso ya bafololo ebengami cerisier, emperere ye moko moto azalaki kobongisa yango na bato mosusu ya boyangeli na ye oyo bazalaki kosala na esambiselo.""  This translates to: ""In Japan, the custom of admiring cherry blossoms began, and one emperor would share it with his courtiers who would hold celebrations.""

This clearly indicates the *people of Japan* (specifically starting with an emperor and his court) initiated and popularized the custom. While the text mentions plum blossoms were admired in China first, it's the Japanese who developed the specific custom around cherry blossoms (cerisier).



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo nini ya Yelusaleme oyo elandi, oyo ekoki kobenda bato mingi te?","The correct answer is **D: Bisika mingi ya kala** (Many historical sites).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Yeruzalemi eza na bisika ya kala oyo eza na masolo ya kala, biloko ya kala, bokoko mingi, eza mpe na bisika minene, bisika ya komela kafe mpe malewa ya minene esika bato mingi bayaka."" (Jerusalem has historical sites that have ancient ruins, ancient buildings, many monuments, and also large sites, cafes and large markets where many people gather.)  This directly addresses the question of what attracts many people to Jerusalem.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ntina ya losambo ya engumba yango** (The political situation of the city) - While the passage mentions it's a capital, it doesn't focus on the political situation *as* the main draw for people.
* **B: Ezalela na yango lokola engumba-mokonzi ya Israël** (It exists as the capital of Israel) - The passage notes this, but also states others don't recognize it as such, and this isn't the core reason people visit.
* **C: Ba offrandes culturelles na yango** (Cultural offerings there) - The passage mentions it's holy to three religions, implying cultural significance, but it doesn't detail *specific* cultural offerings as the main attraction.



"
"Na kati ya makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi elobelami te na mokapo lokola eloko oyo Yelusaleme eyebani mpo na yango?","The correct answer is **B: Bopusi ya politiki (Political conflicts)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""mikili mingi mosusu mpe Etats-Unis endimaka yango te lokola mboka-mokonzi ya Israele"" (many conflicts and the US doesn't recognize it as the capital of Israel). This directly points to ongoing political disputes surrounding Jerusalem's status.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Lisolo ya bato oyo ezali kobenda likebi (The desire of people to live in peace):** While a desire for peace exists, the passage *highlights* conflict, not the pursuit of peace.
* **C: Ndimbola na makambo ya losambo (Problems with commerce):** The passage mentions economic activity (""elimo, ya losambo""), but doesn't focus on *problems* with commerce.
* **D: Bisikia ya bonkokoSites culturels (Cultural sites):** The passage *describes* Jerusalem's rich cultural and religious sites, but doesn't present these sites *as* the problem or the reason for its contested status. The conflict *is about* who controls those sites, not the sites themselves.



Therefore, the passage's primary focus is on the political struggles surrounding Jerusalem."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, lolenge nini ya motu ya mobembo akozwa matomba te soki asombi Carte Sauvage?","The correct answer is **D: Motu ya mobembo oyo azali kotandisa kotala Kruger National Park mpe ata parc mosusu moko.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ekoki mpe kozala malamu na kosomba Wild Card moko, oyo esalisaka na kokota na etuluku moko ya baparke ya Afrika ya sudi to na Baparke nyonso ya Afrika ya sudi.""  This translates to ""It is also possible to use a Wild Card, which allows access to a specific group of parks in South Africa or all parks in South Africa.""

A ""Wild Card"" (Carte Sauvage equivalent) allows access to multiple parks, not just Kruger. Therefore, option D accurately reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text doesn't say a traveler will pay *more* if they have a Wild Card. It implies it could be *beneficial* to have one.
*   **B:**  The text explicitly states the Wild Card can be used for *more than just* Kruger National Park.
*   **C:** This is irrelevant to the question about the Wild Card/Carte Sauvage.



"
Liloba nini elimboli na bosikisiki te Parc national ya Kruger?,"The correct answer is **A: Etalelami lokola esika monene ya kobenda bato na Afrique du Sud** (It is known as a large place to attract people in South Africa).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Eza moko ya bantina oyo ebendaka bato mingi na Afrika ya Sud..."" (It is one of the places that attracts many people in South Africa...).  This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Banyama ya zamba ekeseni na kati ya ba écozones ebele ya parc** (Wild animals are found in the different ecozones of the park): While true, the passage *doesn't* highlight this as the *defining* characteristic. It's a detail, not the main idea.
* **C: Ezali parc ya moke koleka baparc ya Afrique du Sud** (It is a unique park compared to other parks in South Africa): The passage doesn't say it's *unique*, only that it's popular.
* **D: Bapaya bakokota na kati na kosomba Carte ya Zamba** (People can enter by obtaining a Wild Card): While the passage mentions the Wild Card, it's about *how* to enter, not what the park *is* known for.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kobimisa likama mingi mpo na bato oyo bamataka ngomba na biteni nyonso ya ngomba oyo ezali na mabangamabanga?","The correct answer is **A: Makambo ya mai** (Wet conditions/things).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...elingi koloba, mizela ete pema ekatana mpe keba na biteni ya mabe, **mingimingi soki oza na mai**, po ezokoma likama noki.""  This translates to ""...it is important to note that the stone can crack and fall into poor condition, **especially if it is wet**, because it becomes slippery.""

The passage explicitly links wet conditions to the danger of slipping and falling, which would cause the most harm to climbers navigating the difficult terrain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Matambe ya mabanga** (Rock formations) - While the rocks *are* formations, the passage doesn't say they themselves cause the biggest danger.
* **C: Mabulu mikemike** (Small stones) - While small stones are mentioned, they aren't highlighted as the primary cause of serious accidents.
* **D: Basinga ya bibende** (Rope anchors) - The passage mentions steel cables for support, but doesn't state they are a primary *cause* of accidents. They are a safety measure, but don't contribute to falls.



"
"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali komonisa na bosikisiki te bomati ya ngomba Machu Picchu oyo elobelami na mokapo yango?","The correct answer is **C: Osengeli koleka na libulu moko oyo ezali na likoló** (You must wait in one line that is in the area).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Eza na libulu ya moke pene ya likolo oyo basengeli koleka"" - ""There is one line in the area where they must wait."" This directly addresses the waiting procedure for the Ngomba.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ata bato oyo bazali na nzoto kolɔngɔnɔ mpo na komata ngomba bakozanga mpema** - While it mentions people wanting to climb, it doesn't describe a specific waiting procedure.
* **B: Ezali na baporte ya maboko te na biteni nyonso oyo ezali na nse mingi** -  The passage talks about handholds and many steps, but not specifically about restrictions on using them.
* **D: Biteni oyo ezali na nse mingi ekómaka likama ntango ezali na mai** - This describes the *condition* of the steps (slippery when wet) but not a waiting procedure.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na kati ya biloko yango, oyo wapi ezali bilei ya ntina mingi te na bilei ya Majorque?","The correct answer is **A: Mosuni**.

Here's why:

The text states ""mingimingi ya ngulu"" (many pigs) are found in the *mosuni* (mountains). It also contrasts this with the other ingredients that are typical of Majorcan cuisine. The question asks for the ingredient *not* typically found in Majorcan cuisine, and pigs (and thus *mosuni* where they are raised) are presented as the outlier.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Lipa (lips):** The text doesn't mention lips.
*   **C: Mbuma (river):** The text doesn't mention rivers.
*   **D: Bandunda (fields):** Bandunda are specifically mentioned as a place where ingredients *are* grown, fitting with Majorcan cuisine.



"
"Na kotalela makambo oyo ezali na mokapo yango, maloba nini oyo elobeli bilei ya hangi ezali solo te?","The correct answer is **A: Hangi géothermique esalelaka mabanga ya molunge oyo ewuti na moto mpo na kopelisa libulu yango**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bilei ya Hangi elambamaka na libulu ya moto na mabele...moto ya mabele esalaka ete esika yango ekoma moto."" and ""Bisika ebele ya Rotorua ezalaka na biloko ebengami hangi géothermiques, kasi bisika mosusu bakoki kosalela yango lokola bilembo...""
* This directly explains that Hangi uses geothermal energy (mabanga ya molunge oyo ewuti na moto) to heat the oven (kopelisa libulu yango).  The passage highlights geothermal energy as the *source* of heat for Hangi.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hangi oyo esalelaka mabanga ya molunge ezali na Wellington:** While geothermal energy *can* be used in Wellington, the passage doesn't say Hangi itself is *located* or primarily used there.
* **C: Mbala mingi, balambaka bilei ya mpokwa oyo batumbaki na lisalisi ya hangi:**  This refers to the *purpose* of Hangi (cooking food), not what powers it.
* **D: Hangi géothermique ekoki kozwama na Rotorua:** This is true (Rotorua is a geothermal area), but it doesn't explain *how* Hangi works – it just states where it can be found.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi elobelami te lokola lolenge ya momesano ya kopelisa libulu ya hangi?","The correct answer is **A: Gaz**.

Here's why:

The passage describes several ways geothermal energy is harnessed:

*   **Libulu ya moto na mabele** (geothermal wells with steam)
*   **Libulu wana moto na mabanga ya moto oyo euti na moto** (wells with hot water heated by magma/rock)
*   **Molunge géothermique** (geothermal fields - specifically mentioned in relation to Rotorua)

The passage *doesn't* mention gas as a direct method of harnessing geothermal energy, making it the element not described as a way to utilize geothermal resources.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mabanga ya moto** (hot water) - Directly mentioned as a source.
*   **C: Molunge géothermique** (geothermal fields) - Directly mentioned as a location for energy.
*   **D: Mabanga ya moto** (hot water) - Same as B, directly mentioned.



"
Nini ekoki kosala ete monganga to sango moko ayebana na ndenge ya special?,"The correct answer is **B: Kozipa mapeka na yo** (To give alms to them - meaning the monks/nuns).

Here's why:

The passage describes the practice of giving alms (mabolongo) to monks and nuns, specifically mentioning needing to give them food (mapeka).  It states the monks often rely on this alms for sustenance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kolata enveloppe oyo ezipami na kongenga** (To wrap the envelope with a cloth) - The passage doesn't mention envelopes or wrapping.
* **C: Kodefa enveloppe na monastère** (To send an envelope to the monastery) -  The focus is on *giving* directly, not sending something.
* **D: Kolata jupe oyo bakati likolo ya genoux** (To wear a skirt that covers the knees) - This refers to appropriate attire when visiting, but isn’t the special action the passage focuses on for a doctor or healer.

The core message is about charitable giving to the monastic community.



"
"Na bilamba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kozala te mpo na kodefa na monastère? ","The correct answer is **A: Bajupes**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Soki bakei kotala ba monastères, basengaka basi balata ba jupes oyo ezipaka mabolongo..."" (If you want to enter monasteries, they require you to bring skirts that cover your legs...).  It then goes on to discuss the difficulty of obtaining these skirts and the rules surrounding them. This clearly indicates that *jupes* (skirts) are a required item.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Bbaculottes:** These are underwear and not mentioned in the text.
*   **Bapantalons:**  Pants are not mentioned and the text specifically refers to skirts.
*   **Kokanga biloko:** This means ""to bring things"" and is too general – the text specifies *what* things need to be brought.



"
Ntango nini mopaya akozala na mabaku mingi ya kotala minzoto ntango azali kotala bisika ya Antarctique?,"The correct answer is **B: Ntango esika ezali na batu ebele te**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...Lokolo bisika wana ezalaki na bato mingi te, mpe bisika ezali na bato mingi te ezalaka na makambo mingi te, okoki mpe kosepela komona minzoto.""  This translates to: ""The trips there weren't crowded, and trips weren't crowded and didn't have many activities, you could even hope to see penguins.""

This directly links the opportunity to see penguins (minzoto) with the lack of people (bato ebele te) on the trips.  The passage emphasizes the quiet, uncrowded nature of the Antarctic trips as ideal for penguin viewing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Na ntango ya sanza ya moi makasi (In the month of December):** While the passage mentions a time of year (""sanza ya moi makasi""), it doesn't connect that time *specifically* to penguin sightings. It's about the general season for aurora viewing.
* **C: Ntango ya sanza ya malili makasi (In the month of January):**  Similar to A, January is mentioned, but not linked to penguin viewing.
* **D: Ntango nivo ya kobebisa mopepe na mwinda ezali moke (When the level of light reflection in the wind is high):** This is not mentioned in the passage at all.



"
Ntango nini telefone ya satellite ekozala te eloko oyo ekoki kozwa esika ya telefone ya mabɔkɔ?,"The correct answer is **B: Soki esika yango ezali mosika mingi** (If the area is very remote).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that satellite phones are used *when regular cell phone signals aren't available*.  This happens most often in remote areas (""biloko pe mingongo na mosika"") where cell towers don't reach.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Soki nzela ya komona na satellite ekoki kopekisama** (If the view to the satellite is clear) - While a clear view is *necessary* for a satellite phone to work, the passage doesn't say this is why they are *needed* instead of cell phones.  It's assumed a satellite phone user knows to find a clear view.
* **C: Soki ekosalelama libanda** (If it uses a network) - Satellite phones *do* use a network (the satellites!), but that doesn't explain why you'd choose them over a regular cell phone.
* **D: Soki botindi esengi bosenga ya bansango mosusu** (If additional funds are needed from other companies) - The passage mentions the phone company providing data, but cost isn't the primary reason for needing a satellite phone.



"
Ntango nini telefone ya satellite ekozala malamu koleka telefone ?,"The correct answer is **C: Ntango bansango ya mosika ezali na ntina te** (When the network in the area is down).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that satellite phones are used when regular cell phone service is *unavailable*. This happens when you're in areas with no cell towers (""libanda"") or when the regular network is down (""bansango ya mosika ezali na ntina te"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ntango ozali na congé na engumba moko** (When you are on vacation in a country) - While you *might* use a satellite phone on vacation, it's not the primary reason for their existence. Regular roaming often works in many countries.
*   **B: Na ntango ya mobembo ya masuwa** (During emergencies) - While satellite phones *are* used in emergencies, the passage focuses on their use in areas lacking coverage, not solely during emergencies.
*   **D: Ntango omoni okoki kozala wapi telefone ekoki kosala malamu** (When you know where a phone can work well) - This doesn't explain *why* you'd choose a satellite phone over a regular one.



"
Matata mpo na oyo wapi kati na makambo oyo elandi ememaki na kokela République ya Transnistrie?,"The correct answer is **A: Nkita**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Na 1994, bitumba wana ebimisaki ekolo ya nsima oyo bango moko babengaki Transnistrie na este ya Moldavie, eza na boyangeli na yango mpe mosolo na yango, kasi ata lisanga moko te oyo eza kati ya ONU endima yango.""  This translates to: ""In 1994, conflicts led to the creation of a breakaway territory called Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and army, but is not recognized by any UN member state.""

The word ""bitumba"" (conflicts) directly indicates that **nkita** (conflict) is the root cause of the situation with the Transnistrie Republic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bikolo** (Countries) - While other countries are involved (Russia's influence is mentioned), the immediate cause *within* Moldova was conflict.
*   **C: Lokota** (Language) - Language is mentioned as Romanian/Russian, but isn't the *cause* of the Transnistria situation.
*   **D: Losambo** (Religion) - Religion (Orthodox Christianity) is stated as important, but not the cause of the conflict.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi République Transnistrie ezali na yango oyo ekeseni na Moldavie mobimba?  ","The correct answer is **A: Lokota**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Na 1994, bitumba wana ebimisaki ekolo ya nsima oyo bango moko babengaki Transnistrie na este ya Moldavie..."" This translates to ""In 1994, conflicts led to the creation of a region called Transnistria in eastern Moldova...""

Therefore, Transnistria is a region *within* Moldova, a part of its territory.  ""Lokota"" (meaning land/territory) best describes this relationship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Losambo (Politics)** - While there are political issues surrounding Transnistria, the question asks *where* it is located, not about the political situation.
*   **C: Bondimi ya ONU (UN involvement)** - The text states the UN doesn't recognize Transnistria, but this doesn't define its location.
*   **D: Mbongo (Conflict)** - Conflict *led to* the creation of Transnistria, but it doesn't define where it is geographically.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ntango nini mobembo asengeli kokende na Montevideo soki azali na elikya ya kokima makambo ya mopepe?","The correct answer is **D: Na basanza ya eleko ya été ya Montevideo**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Montevideo eza na bituka ya likolo ya tropicale; na basanza ya eleko ya molunge, mbala ba temperature ekomaki kino na +30°C."" (Montevideo is in a tropical zone; during the summer, temperatures often exceed +30°C).
* **The question asks:** When should someone go to Montevideo if they want warm weather?
* **Therefore:** The best time to go for warm weather would be during Montevideo's summer (eleko ya été).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Na basanza ya malili makasi ya Hémisphère du Nord (During the warm season of the Northern Hemisphere):** While the text mentions the Northern Hemisphere, it's referring to *when* it's warm *there*, not when it's warm in Montevideo. Montevideo is in the Southern Hemisphere.
* **B: Na eleko ya kokauka ya Montevideo (During Montevideo's autumn):** The text doesn't indicate autumn is warm.
* **C: Na basanza ya eleko ya été ya Hémisphère du Nord (During the summer of the Northern Hemisphere):**  Again, this refers to the Northern Hemisphere's summer, which is winter in Montevideo.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ntango nini mobembo asengeli kokende kotala Montevideo soki bazali ndambo na klima ya malili?","The correct answer is **A: Tango ekomi été na Montevideo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Montevideo eza na bituka ya likolo ya tropicale...na basanza ya eleko ya molunge, mbala ba temperature ekomaki kino na +30°C.""  This describes a hot climate, characteristic of summer.
* **The passage also explains:** The climate isn't strongly defined by traditional seasons (dry/rainy) but experiences high temperatures.
* **Options B, C, and D are incorrect:**
    * **B:**  The passage focuses on Montevideo's climate, not the Northern Hemisphere's.
    * **C:**  The passage says seasons aren't strongly defined.
    * **D:** Hiver (winter) implies cold temperatures, which contradicts the description of +30°C temperatures.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi kati na makambo oyo elandi ekozala na boyokani na mosali ya graffiti oyo ayebani mingi, na bokeseni na kobebisama?","The correct answer is **D: Ba étiquettes oyo ekoki kotangama te** (Tags that cannot be removed).

Here's why:

* **P's text** describes a shift in graffiti – moving away from elaborate pieces (""mayemi ya minene ya solo, milulu ya mayemi mpe mayemi """"ya solo"""" na bifelo"") and towards simpler, quick tags.  Crucially, it states these tags are often *difficult to remove* (""Mbala mingi na bisika wana mayemi ekokanaka na mayemi kasi te na baetikete oyo bakoki kotanga.""). This is the core of the problem described – the persistence of these tags.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Makambo ya kosala ba graffiti** (Things about doing graffiti) - This is too broad. The passage is *about a change in* graffiti, not just graffiti in general.
* **B: Kokoma na makomi** (Hiding in places) - While graffiti is often done in hidden places, this isn't the focus of the passage.
* **C: Ba fresques oyo elingi te na biloko ya leta** (Murals that are not legal) - The passage doesn’t specifically discuss legality or murals, focusing more on the *type* of graffiti being done.



Therefore, option D best reflects the issue highlighted in the passage: the difficulty in removing the new style of graffiti tags."
Likambo nini ya bafɛti ya miziki oyo bayangani mosusu batalelaka lokola eteni ya ntina mingi mpo na likambo yango?,"The correct answer is **C: Musiquei ezali kobɛta tii na butu makasi** (Music is able to play even in deep darkness).

Here's why:

The passage states that many people who go to music festivals like to camp nearby, and some believe the festivals are the cause of a lot of trouble. It then says that *even if* the main stage's music stops, other festivals can continue playing music in the darkness. This directly supports the idea that music continues to be played even in difficult/dark conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Komema bana mike** (Bringing young children) - The passage mentions children at camping sites, but doesn't link this to the *reason* people attribute problems to the festivals.
*   **B: Kosala kaa na esika yango** (Making noise in that place) - While festivals are noisy, the passage focuses on the belief that they *cause trouble*, not just the noise itself.
*   **D: Kokota liboso ya ngonga** (Counting the number of tents) - This isn't mentioned at all in the passage.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini mosali ya festival asengeli kotya na esika ya liboso soki alingi kosala camp pene na miziki?","The correct answer is **A: Kokende na butu makasi** (Pack heavily).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Soki olingi kosala pene ya esika makambo ezosalema, osengeli **kokende na liboso po esika na yo ezala pene na miziki.**""  (If you want to be near the action, you need to **pack heavily so your spot is near the music.**)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kofanda na esika oyo ezali mpo na mabota** (To set up in the area for bathrooms) - The passage doesn't mention bathrooms as a priority for being near the music.
* **C: Kosala camp libanda ya esika yango** (To camp far from that place) - This is the *opposite* of what the passage suggests.
* **D: Kokota liboso ya ngonga** (To carry a shoulder bag) - While helpful, packing heavily is the key to securing a good spot.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, wapi bapaya basengeli kokima tango bazali koluka bomoi ya butu na nord ya Nouveau-Mexique?","The correct answer is **B: Babare ya bamboka ya mike**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Keba: babare ya bamboka ya mike ezalaka te ntango nyonso bisika ya malamu oyo bapaya bauti mboka mosusu basengeli kokende."" This translates to: ""However, truck stops are not always available for the good prices that people traveling from other states need to find."" 

This directly indicates that truck stops are where travelers (people leaving a rural life for cities) need to go to find better prices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bapueblos:** The passage mentions pueblos as places people are *leaving* from, not places to stop for better prices.
*   **C: Ba centres commerciaux:** The passage mentions large companies and malls as contributing to higher prices, not offering relief for travelers.
*   **D: Bacasino:** The passage states casinos contribute to higher costs of living, not offering solutions for those seeking better deals.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, wapi mopaya akoki kozwa masano oyo eyebani mingi na nord ya Nouveau-Mexique?","The correct answer is **C: Na casino moko pene na Santa Fe**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bacasino nyonso oyo batie bankombo na yango likolo awa etekaka masanga, mpe mingi na yango ememaka masano ya malamu mpenza euti na bakompani ya minene...mengi na yango ememaka masano ya malamu mpenza euti na bakompani ya minene (mingimingi ya minene oyo ezalaka zingazinga ya Albuquerque mpe Santa Fe)."" This translates to: ""All the casinos that offer their money here generate income, and many of them create good jobs for large companies...many of them create good jobs for large companies (many of the large ones located around Albuquerque and Santa Fe).""
* **The passage also mentions:** Casinos near Santa Fe are key players in providing these jobs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Na casino moko ngonga mibale longwa na Albuquerque:** While Albuquerque has casinos, the passage focuses more on those around Santa Fe when discussing job creation.
* **B: Na engumba moko oyo ezali mosika:** The passage is specifically about casinos, not just any market town.
* **D: Na bar moko ya engumba moke:** The passage is about casinos and their economic impact, not bars.



"
Bato oyo basalaka mibembo oyo bayebaka budget bakoki kolinga kokima lolenge nini ya masanga?,"The correct answer is **B: Mayi ya milangi** (Tap water).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mai ya robinet ya mboka eza malamu mpenza mpona komela, kasi eza pete na kozwa mai ya milangi soki ozobanga.""  This translates to ""Tap water is very good and cheap, but it's possible to get bottled water if you want.""  This directly implies that choosing tap water is a budget-friendly option.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vin ya Australie (Australian wine)** - The text mentions Australian coffee, not wine, and doesn't suggest it's a budget option.
*   **C: Bière ya mboka (Local beer)** - The text doesn't mention local beer.
*   **D: Jus ya mbuma (Fruit juice)** - The text says juice is plentiful but doesn't specify it's cheap. It just says it's good.



"
"Na kotalela esika oyo elobelami na mokapo yango, na ba commandes ya masanga oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kobulunganisa serveur moko?","The correct answer is **A: Moindo moko ya mokuse** (One coffee).

Here's why:

The passage discusses coffee orders specifically: ""Ya moindo ya mokuse eza 'expresso', cappuccino ezalaka na creme mingi (fulufulu te) mpe bapesaka ti kozanga miliki."" This directly relates to what one might order from a server.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nimero ya Yambo** (Number One) - This refers to a dance, not something you'd order.
*   **C: Sauvignon Blanc moko oyo euti na Nouvelle-Zélande** (A Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand) - While wine is mentioned as being good from New Zealand and Australia, the passage focuses on coffee.
*   **D: Pembe moko ya plat** (A side dish) - The passage doesn't discuss side dishes.



"
"Eumelaki bikeke misato, eleko ya colonisation ebandaki na groupe nini?","The correct answer is **D: Bato ya Espagne** (The Spanish).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ebotamaki nsima ya bokutani ya baEspagnole oyo babotolaki mboka na bituluku ya bakolo-mboka."" This translates to ""...they began the time of conflict with the Spanish who conquered the land from the native populations.""  It clearly identifies the Spanish as the colonizing group who initiated conflict and took over the land.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bato ya Payagua** - The Payaguá were a native group *affected* by colonization, not the colonizers themselves.
*   **B: Bato ya Guaycurú** -  Similar to the Payaguá, the Guaycurú were a native group.
*   **C: Bato ya Guaraní** - While important to the history of Paraguay, the Guaraní are identified as native populations being impacted, not the colonizers.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, moyen nini ya malamu ya kosala que parisien a chauffer yo?","The correct answer is **C: acte ya politesse (an act of politeness)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) emphasizes politeness and good manners (""courtoisies de base"") as key to being well-received in Paris.** It states that Parisians appreciate basic politeness. The passage directly links being ""warmly welcomed"" to being polite and respectful.
* **""Chauffer yo""** in this context means to be unfriendly or give you the cold shoulder.  Avoiding this is linked to politeness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Meka ko imiter ezaleli ya Paris (Pretend to be Parisian):** The passage doesn't suggest *imitating* Parisians, but rather behaving with basic courtesy.
* **B: Bimisa elikya (Hide your money):** This isn't mentioned in the passage and is irrelevant to being treated well.
* **D: Lakisa bizaleli ya libanda (Criticize the city's inhabitants):** The passage clearly implies the opposite - treat the inhabitants with respect.



"
"Nakotala oyo eleki, nini na oyo elandi etalelami te lokola bizaleli oyo ba Parisien bazalaka na yango mingi?","The correct answer is **A: Lolendo**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""Eyebana ete bato ya Paris bazalaka moimi, kozonga botosi, pe **lolendo**. Atako eza kaka ndakisa oyo eza ya sikisiki te..."" (Understand that Parisians are arrogant, condescending, and **rude**. Although it's just a stereotype that isn't always true...)

The question (Q) asks what characteristic is *not* like how Parisians often are.  The passage directly identifies ""lolendo"" (rudeness) as a perceived trait.  The other options are presented as positive or neutral qualities.

Therefore, **lolendo** is the characteristic the question is asking about.



"
Litomba nini ezali na Esika ya Liboso na Cape Town MetroRail?,"The correct answer is **B: Bato mingi lokola te**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""MetroPlus ezalaka kitoko mingi mpe **na bato mingi te**..."" which translates to ""MetroPlus is more comfortable but **has fewer people**...""

This directly answers the question about what is different at the Station of Liboso (presumably a station name) on the Cape Town MetroRail.  The difference is a smaller crowd.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Molakisi azali liboso ya train:** The text doesn't mention conductors or who is leading the train.
*   **C: Ezali na ntalo moke koleka tike ya Classe ya Misato:** This relates to a price difference for different classes, and isn't the primary difference mentioned.
*   **D: Ezali na ntalo moko na billet ya Metro:** This refers to a difference in the ticket itself, not the experience at the station.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, engunduka nionso ya komema batu na Cap Town ezalaka na nini?","The correct answer is **D: Balakisi ya liboso mpe ya misato** (First and Third Class systems).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""MetroRail eza na biteni mibale na bingbunduka ya bamboka pe zingazinga ya Cap Town: MetroPlus (oyo babengaka pe First Class) pe Metro (oyo babengaka pe Third Class)."" This directly translates to ""MetroRail has two classes of carriages on the train lines in the Cape Town area: MetroPlus (also called First Class) and Metro (also called Third Class).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Molakisi ya Metro oyo etondi na bato mingi te** (The Metro operator that doesn't carry many people) - While MetroPlus *doesn't* carry as many people, the question asks about the *systems* of transport, not the operator.
* **B: Ntalo ya billet ndenge moko mpo na bisikanionso mibale** (A single fare system for two carriages) - The passage doesn't mention fare systems.
* **C: Bakelasi misato ekeseni** (Only three classes exist) - The passage states there are *two* classes, not three.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi nyama mabe ekoki kosala te?","The correct answer is **D: Kpesa mpota oyo ekokaki kozala te** (Causing discomfort that can't be relieved).

Here's why:

The passage (P) states that bad/poisonous animals can cause a variety of problems: bites, pain, allergies, infections, and diseases.  It *also* mentions they often cause suffering that goes unnoticed or isn't talked about (""mbala mingi balobaka te ete eza mabe"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kopesa kobeba ya poso ya nzoto** (Causing a painful wound) - The passage *specifically* mentions bites and pain.
* **B: Kosilikisa ba allergie** (Causing allergies) - The passage *specifically* mentions allergies.
* **C: Kopanza infection** (Causing infection) - The passage *specifically* mentions infections.

Therefore, the only option that represents a problem caused by poisonous animals *not* directly listed in the passage as a specific effect is prolonged, unrelieved discomfort.  The passage hints at this through the idea of suffering that isn't addressed.



"
Epai wapi bakoki kosomba bakarte ya telefone oyo efutami liboso?,"The correct answer is **C: Na babutike ya pembeni** (In nearby shops).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Babutiki nyonso ya pene ya balabala etondaki na bakarte ya telefone mingi mpenza..."" (All nearby shops sell many phone cards...).  This directly links phone cards to being sold in *babutike ya pembeni* (nearby shops).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Na bikolo oyo eyebani:** (In the current banks) - The passage doesn't mention banks selling phone cards.
* **B: Na bisika ya kotelema ya engunduka:** (At mobile money points) - While mobile money is related to phones, the passage specifically refers to *bakarte* (cards), not mobile money transactions.
* **D: Na esika ya kofuta telefone:** (At phone repair shops) -  Repair shops might *use* phones, but aren't a primary place to *buy* cards for them.



"
Lifuti malamu oyo bacarte mosusu ya telephone epesaka ezalaka ndenge nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Na nzela ya motango ya ofele** (Through an official exchange).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mbala mingi bato bazwaka misala wana na nzela ya nimero ya telefone ya ofele oyo bakoki kobenga na batelefone mingi ya ofele.""  This translates to: ""Often people get these numbers through an official phone number exchange that they can use on many phones.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bakoki kozwa yango kaka na bikolo eyebana** (They can only get it from known circles) - The passage doesn't say this. It refers to an official system.
* **C: Na butike ya pembeni** (At a nearby store) - The passage doesn't mention stores.
* **D: Na kosalelaka telefone oyo efutaka mpe kofuta mbongo mosusu** (By using the phone that works and paying more money) - While sometimes services cost money, this isn't the main way the passage describes getting these numbers.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, banzete nini kati na banzete oyo elandi ezali mingi te na Parc national ya Plitvice Lakes?","The correct answer is **A: Hêtre**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Parke national ya Plitvice bakata banzete na yango mingi, **mingimingi ba hêtres**..."" (Plitvice National Park has many trees, **especially beeches**...).  This directly indicates that beeches (hêtres) are the most abundant type of tree in the park.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Chêne (Oak):** The text doesn't mention oaks being particularly abundant.
*   **C: Sapin (Fir):** The text mentions sapins, but doesn't say they are the *most* abundant.
*   **D: Épicéa (Spruce):**  The text mentions *sapins* and *épicéa* as being present but doesn't highlight their abundance.



"
"Na banyama oyo emonanaka mingi te, oyo wapi ekoki kozwama na parke national ya Plitvice Lakes?","The correct answer is **B: Tétra monene** (Capercaillie).

The text specifically mentions ""tétras monene"" (great capercaillie) as one of the animals that can be found in Plitvice Lakes National Park, and states it's a rare animal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dindon** (Turkey) - Not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Cassowary** - A bird native to Australia and New Guinea, not Europe.
*   **D: Tétra monene** - This is a duplicate of option B and is therefore also correct, but less concise.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, bakoode ya esika esalisaka mpenza na nini?","The correct answer is **A: Kosala kopi na disque** (Making copies on disc).

Here's why:

* **P's statement** discusses companies preventing profit loss due to piracy. It then explains how their method (copying everything onto a single disc) ensures that even if someone steals the disc, it's only a copy of *their* content, not others. This directly points to making copies on discs as the core practice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kolanda nkita** (Stealing signatures) - This is unrelated to the context of piracy and content protection.
* **C: Kopekisa koyiba nzembo ya batu mosusu** (Copying and claiming others' songs) - This is a form of plagiarism, but not the central issue being discussed in P's statement (which is preventing *others* from copying *their* work).
* **D: Kosala kopi oyo elandi mibeko te** (Making illegal copies) - While piracy *is* illegal copying, the passage doesn't describe *doing* illegal copies; it describes a method to *prevent* losses from illegal copies.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi na oyo elandi ezali lokuta sur ba codes ya région ezali perpétué na ba entreprises ya médias?","The correct answer is **C: Bazali na ntina mpo na kobalusa mbongo** (They are looking to increase profits).

Here's why:

* **P's statement** discusses companies restricting access to content to prevent piracy, but ultimately argues it's about increasing profits (""makambo ya mbongo""). The entire passage points to a financial motivation behind these practices.
* **Q's question** asks about the continuation of regional codes by media companies.  Regional codes *are* a method to control distribution and maximize profit by preventing cheaper imports or unauthorized copies from undermining sales in different regions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bazali na ntina mpo na kozwa bokonzi mingi na zando** (They are looking to improve access to content) - The passage argues the opposite; access is being *restricted*.
* **B: Basalisaka mpo na koboya kosala bakopi oyo eyokani te na mibeko** (They are trying to prevent illegal copies) - While preventing piracy is *a stated reason*, the passage suggests it's a facade for profit.
* **D: Basalisaka mingi te mpo na kopekisa piraterie** (They are not doing much to encourage piracy) - This is irrelevant to the core argument about profit.



Therefore, **C** best reflects the underlying motivation described in the passage."
"Ntango okokóma na mboka na yo, mbala mingi mosala nini esalemaka na ndenge ya momeseno te?","The correct answer is **D: Kolanda makambo ya duane** (Dealing with customs).

Here's why:

* **P** clearly states that when arriving in a country, dealing with customs (""makambo ya douane"") can be a major issue. It advises being aware of what you can and can't do, and following the rules.
* **Q** asks what often happens in a problematic way when arriving in a country.
* Customs issues are the most direct connection to the advice given in **P**.  The other options are less directly related to potential problems upon arrival.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Kotala makambo ya immigration** (Immigration matters) - While important, immigration is usually handled *before* customs.
* **B: Kosakola biloko** (Packing belongings) - This happens *before* arrival.
* **C: Bandelo ya mibeko ya biloko** (Rules about belongings) - This is knowledge you *need* for customs, but isn't the *process* itself.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi osengeli koyeba liboso ya kokóma na mboka na yo?","The correct answer is **A: Soki okolandela makambo ya douane** (If you follow customs matters).

**Here's why:**

The passage (P) explicitly states: ""...kolandela makambo ya douane ekoki kozala motungisi monene"" (following customs matters can be a big problem).  The question (Q) asks where you need to be careful when entering the country. The passage directly links problems to customs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Soki osengeli kosakola biloko oyo eleki ndelo oyo mibeko epesi** (If you need to declare items that are easily prohibited by law) - While true in general, the passage doesn't focus on prohibited items specifically, but on the process of customs itself.
* **C: Soki okolandela makambo ya douane** - This is a repeat of A.
* **D: Soki biloko oyo ozali komema epesami nzela te** (If the items you are carrying are not legal) - This is about *illegal* items, whereas the passage is about the *process* of customs, even for legal items.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ebele ya biloko oyo epesaka nzela na bato oyo bamataka bangomba bázwa ntango nyonso banzela ya sika na kati ya Lobwaku ya Cochamó?","The correct answer is **D: Bifelo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Bato ya bamboka nyonso oyo bamataka balandaka kosala banzela ya sika na kati oyo **bifelo oyo ezanga suka**."" This translates to ""All the climbers go there to make routes among those **rocks that rise**.""

The question asks what makes climbing possible in Cochamó Valley, and the passage directly attributes it to the *bifelo* (rocks).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Makanisi:**  This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: Bikita:** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Ya likolo:** While the valley is beautiful, the passage focuses on the physical structures that *allow* climbing, not just the scenery.



"
"Na kotalela makambo oyo epesami na mokapo yango, nani azali kolobela bisika oyo bakatisi mingi na Hémisphère Sud?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Star Alliance ezwaka eteni wana mobimba longola Pacifique ya sudi este banda na Santiago ya Chilie kino Tahiti, oyo eza mobembo ya mpepo LATAM Oneworld.""  This translates to ""Star Alliance has a strong presence in this region along the South Pacific, east of Santiago, Chile to Tahiti, which is LATAM Oneworld's strong area.""  

This implies Star Alliance is actively competing and providing service in the South Pacific, making them the alliance with the most routes in the Southern Hemisphere, even though they don't cover *all* of it (and SkyTeam covers none). The text specifically highlights their expansion *into* LATAM Oneworld's territory.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: SkyTeam:** The text explicitly states SkyTeam doesn't have routes in the Southern Hemisphere.
*   **C: South Pacific:** This is a *region*, not an airline alliance.
*   **D: LATAM Oneworld:** While strong in a specific area (Chile to Tahiti), the passage suggests Star Alliance is challenging them and expanding its network.



"
Alliance nini ya ba compagnies aériennes ezo couvrir kokatisa ya océan moke na Hémisphère du Sud?,"The correct answer is **A: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Star Alliance ezwaka eteni wana mobimba longola Pacifique ya sudi este banda na Santiago ya Chilie kino Tahiti..."" which translates to ""Star Alliance covers this route across the South Pacific east of Santiago, Chile to Tahiti...""  This directly answers the question of which alliance covers a significant ocean route in the Southern Hemisphere.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: South Pacific** - This is a geographical region, not an airline alliance.
* **C: LATAM Oneworld** - While LATAM is mentioned, it is described as *being* covered by Star Alliance on this specific route, not *covering* it itself.
* **D: SkyTeam** - The text explicitly states SkyTeam doesn't cover any routes in the Southern Hemisphere.



"
Ebongiseli nini ya kotambola elongaki Global Running Tours?,"The correct answer is **B: Go Running Tours**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Molandi ya Global Running Tours, **Go Running Tours** asali réseau eza na bafournisseur mingi ya sightrunning na bakontina minei."" This directly identifies Go Running Tours as a company associated with Global Running Tours.

The other options are *examples* of tours *within* the Global Running Tours network, not the overarching company itself.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, Go Running Tours esalisaka mpo na kokangisa bibongiseli boni ya ndenge na ndenge ya sightrunning?","The correct answer is **B: 200**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""P: Na mokili mobimba, eza na bibongiseli pene ya 200 oyo eza na kosala.""  This translates to: ""Currently, there are around 200 tours available.""

The question asks how many tours Go Running Tours offers. The text directly states 200.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Minei** - This means ""many"" but isn't a specific number.
*   **C: douzaines** - This means ""dozens"" (12), which is not the number given in the text.
*   **D: Misato** - This doesn't have a relevant meaning in this context.



"
Touriste asengeli kosala nini soki azali na elikya ya komona guépard polele soki likoki ezali?,"The correct answer is **C: Salela ba jumelles** (Use binoculars).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Banyama mosusu, na ndakisa banzoku na badikala, balingaka kopusa mpenza pene ya mituka pe bisaleli ebongi ekosalisa na komona malamu.""  This translates to ""Other animals, for example leopards and cheetahs, are very elusive and good binoculars are needed to see them well.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kende na safari ya kotambola na bangomba** (Go on a guided safari): While a guided safari *increases* your chances, it doesn't guarantee seeing a cheetah. The passage emphasizes the *difficulty* in spotting them.
* **B: Kende kotambola na zamba** (Go travel in the bush):  Similar to A, this doesn't guarantee success.
* **D: Zwá motuka mpe salelá bisaleli oyo bizali na momeseno** (Rent a car and use the facilities that are in the reserve):  This is irrelevant to specifically seeing a cheetah.



"
"Nakotala oyo eleki, na banyama oyo balandi, nyama nini mopaya akoki kokutana na yango ntango azali kosala mobembo na safari na motuka?","The correct answer is **C: Bankoi ya nzoto peto ya minene** (Large rhinoceros).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bankoi ya nkozi ya zamba, bankoi ya nzoto peto ya mike mpe **bankoi ya nzoto peto ya minene bazalaka mingi na kobanga mpe okomona yango malamu soki olati maneti ya minene.**""  This translates to: ""Leopards, small rhinos, and **large rhinos are often encountered and seen well if you have good binoculars.**""

This clearly indicates that a large rhino is a common animal one might encounter while on safari with a vehicle (implied by ""soki olati maneti ya minene"" - if you have good binoculars, used for viewing from a distance).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bankoi ya nkozi ya zamba (Leopard):** While mentioned, the text doesn't specifically tie it to being seen *from* a vehicle.
*   **B: Badikala (Elephants):** Mentioned as an animal that likes shade, but not linked to vehicle-based viewing.
*   **D: bankoi ya nzoto peto ya mike (Small rhino):**  Also mentioned, but the text emphasizes the larger rhino being easily seen with binoculars.



"
"Kolandana na bokomi, nini ekokaki kokitisa ntalo ya mobembo?","The correct answer is **D: Kozwa etuluku ya bato motoba to koleka** (Borrowing from the rich and giving to the poor).

Here's why:

The passage (P) directly states that the problem being discussed is that people often suffer because they don't have enough money, and that *wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few, preventing many from having enough*.  It also hints at the idea that people leave their homeland to seek better lives (implying economic hardship).  The passage suggests a solution involves a redistribution of wealth - making sure more people have access to resources.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kokende yo moko (Being alone)** - This is the opposite of what the passage suggests. The passage speaks of connection and helping others.
* **B: Kozwa etuluku ya bato minei (Borrowing from the poor)** - This would *worsen* the problem described in the passage.
* **C: Kokende na moto mosusu moko (Being with another person)** - While connection is good, it doesn't address the core economic issue.



Therefore, **D** is the only option that aligns with the passage's discussion of wealth distribution and addressing the suffering caused by poverty. It suggests taking from those who have a lot (the rich) and giving to those who have little (the poor)."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nani akozala na likoki ya kozwa motuya ya mobembo oyo eleki malamu?","The correct answer is **B: Etuluku ya bato misato** (A group of people).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses the problem of people exploiting tourism by overcharging visitors.** It mentions that people often leave their homes to profit from tourists, and this leads to excessive pricing.  The passage implies this happens because *groups* of people are taking advantage of the situation.
* **Option B directly addresses this – ""Etuluku ya bato misato"" (a group of people) are the ones able to exploit the situation for profit.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ba touristes oyo balingi ko mélanger mituka (Tourists who can mix currencies):** This doesn't relate to the exploitation described in the passage.
* **C: Baninga mibale bazali kosala mobembo elongo (Young people are doing long business):** While young people might be involved, the passage doesn't focus on age, but rather on the *group* taking advantage of tourists.
* **D: Etuluku ya bato mitano (A group of five people):** This is too specific. The passage doesn't mention a specific number of people. It's a general problem with groups exploiting tourists.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini esalaki ete San Francisco endimama na mokili mobimba?","The correct answer is **A: Kozala mbala na mbala na mitindo ndenge na ndenge ya mayemi mpe ya bapanzi-nsango** (Being a place with many different styles of art and cultures).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** San Francisco is depicted as a place frequently represented in music, film, books, and popular culture *because* of its connection to the counterculture/hippie movement (""mokili mobimba""). It's known for its progressive and artistic environment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bisika ya mayangani ya malamu mpenza** (Expensive real estate) - While the passage mentions expensive real estate, it doesn't say this *causes* San Francisco to be associated with the counterculture. It's a result *of* its popularity.
* **C: Bokeseni ya nkita** (Cat fondness) - The passage mentions cats, but doesn't link them to the counterculture association.
* **D: Esika moko ya bilei ya Asie oyo ezali se kokola** (A place with a growing Asian population) - The passage mentions Asian communities, but doesn't make this the *reason* for its counterculture association. It's a contributing factor to its diverse culture, but not the primary connection to the '60s movement.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali solo te?","The correct answer is **D: Nkita etie motema mobimba na tourisme** (San Francisco has a big heart for tourism).

Here's why:

* **The passage repeatedly emphasizes San Francisco's welcoming nature towards tourists.** It talks about how it caters to large numbers of visitors, offers many attractions (hotels, restaurants, sights), and celebrates different cultures (Asian communities) – all things related to tourism.  The phrase ""boyokani na ndenge ebendaka bapaya mingi ya mokili mobimba"" directly translates to welcoming a large number of tourists.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Esili komonana mbala mingi na bafilme mpe na babuku** (It is often seen in films and books) - While the passage *mentions* it's depicted in media, that's a *result* of its appeal, not the core idea.
* **B: Bilei ya Asie epalangani mingi** (Asian communities are numerous) - This is a detail *within* the larger point about San Francisco's appeal, not the central theme.
* **C: Ba hotels mpe bisika ya mayangani ezali mingi** (There are many hotels and luxury shops) - Again, this is a *feature* of the city, a consequence of attracting tourism, but not the main point.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, mosali mobembo nini akoki kozwa matomba te soki asaleli misala ya agent ya mobembo?","The correct answer is **C: Mosali mobembo oyo azwi naino visa na ye te** (A traveler who does not have a visa).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bakoki kokangela yo esika soki oza na mposa ya ntango mpona kokanisa eloko bapesi yo to kozwa mikanda mosusu mpona esika ozokende (na ndakisa viza).""  This translates to: ""They can deny you a place if you are late to provide the documents they ask for, or to obtain other documents for the place you are going (for example, a visa).""

Therefore, someone *without* a visa (azwi naino visa na ye te) would be denied a place by the travel agency, even if they meet the agent's other requirements.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mosali mobembo ayebi mpenza te oyo alingi** (A traveler who doesn't know what they want) - While this could be a problem, the passage doesn't specifically mention it as a reason for denial.
* **B: Mosali mobembo oyo azali na momeseno ya kosala makambo na mbalakaka** (A traveler who is accustomed to doing things haphazardly) - This is a character trait, not a logistical barrier described in the text.
* **D: Mosali mobembo oyo alingaka mingi kosala réservation ya boyokani** (A traveler who likes to make last-minute reservations) - The passage mentions needing to provide documents *on time*, but doesn't explicitly say last-minute bookings are disallowed.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi elobelami te na mokapo lokola litomba ya kosala réservation na nzela ya agent ya mobembo?","The correct answer is **A: Mikanda ya mobembo oyo esalemi nokinoki**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Bakoki kokangela yo esika soki oza na mposa ya ntango mpona kokanisa eloko bapesi yo to kozwa mikanda mosusu mpona esika ozokende (na ndakisa viza).""  This translates to: ""...They can reserve a place for you if you are on time to check the items they send you or get other documents for the place you are going (for example, a visa).""

This directly implies that the travel agent (agent ya mobembo) needs travel documents (mikanda ya mobembo) to make the reservation.  The other options are not directly mentioned as requirements for using the travel agent.

* **B: Boyokani ya hotel** (Hotel preferences) - The passage says arrangements are *separate* from the hotel.
* **C: Kofuta biloko nionso** (Paying for everything) - While cost is mentioned, it doesn't state it's a requirement *before* making the reservation.
* **D: Kosimba réservation** (Confirming the reservation) -  Confirmation happens *after* the reservation process, not as a prerequisite.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ezali na makoki te ya baprograme ya kobongola makomi na tango ya solo?","The correct answer is **D: Kobongola malamu 100% ya tango**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""sikoyo ebongalaka na ndenge ya mwa malamu (pe mbala mingi te buzoba)"" which translates to ""it rarely translates perfectly (and often isn't accurate)."" This directly implies that 100% accuracy is something a translation program *cannot* do.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kobongola bilembo na minoko ya bapaya** - The passage *mentions* this as a capability of some apps, so it's something they *can* do.
* **B: Kobongola biteni mobimba ya makomi** - The passage states the program can translate ""biteni milai ya maloba,"" meaning small portions of speech - essentially, it can translate snippets of text.
* **C: Kobongola makomi na biloko na nzela ya smartphone** - The passage specifically says apps can do this (translate words from images using a smartphone).



"
Nini epesaka nzela na kobongola mabongoli na nzela ya Internet te?,"The correct answer is **C: Kozwa bansango ya lokota** (Downloading language packs).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""...Google Translate, oyo esalisaka na kobongola makambo ata oza te na internet nsima ya kozwa basango nyonso ya lokota olingi.""  This translates to ""...Google Translate, which allows you to translate even without the internet after downloading all the necessary language packs.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Basini ya kobongola oyo ebongisami** (The translation system itself) - This is too general. It doesn't explain *how* you can translate offline.
* **B: Smartphones** - Smartphones are the *device* used, but not the method of offline translation.
* **D: Baapplication oyo ezali kati na ba oyo ekosalisa nan tango ekokani** (Applications that are among those that can be used at any time) -  This is a description of many apps, not specifically what enables offline translation.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali te likambo oyo ebimisaka ba avalanches?","The correct answer is **A: Neige oyo ekangamaka (Unstable snow)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mokakatano eza ete neige eza ya kokangama, yango wana esengeli ata ndambu ekwea na se, mpe soki ndambu ya neige ekiti na se, ekoki kobenda oyo etikali.""  This translates to: ""The problem is that the snow is unstable, therefore even a small disturbance is needed on it, and if the disturbance of the snow occurs on it, it can trigger what is on top.""  This directly links unstable snow to the cause of avalanches (""oyo etikali"" refers to the snow layer above that collapses).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Batu (Rocks):** While rocks can *contribute* to avalanche danger, they aren't the primary cause described in the text.
* **C: Kongenga ya moyi (Wind):** Wind can *affect* snowpack, making it unstable, but the passage doesn't identify wind itself as the direct trigger.
* **D: Neige oyo ebakisami (Settled snow):** Settled snow is stable, the opposite of what causes avalanches.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi kati na oyo elandi ekiti lokola ba avalanches?","The correct answer is **A: Neige ya kokangama oyo ebimi te** (Unstable snow that doesn't bind).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a dangerous snow situation:**  The text talks about snow that can easily be triggered (""kokangama""), causing collapses (""ekokita lekola esopani ya neje""), and being similar to avalanches.  It emphasizes that unstable snow is a key factor.
* **Option A directly addresses this:**  ""Neige ya kokangama oyo ebimi te"" means ""Unstable snow that doesn't bind"" – this is *exactly* the type of snow that would cause a collapse like an avalanche.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mabwaku oto etelemi makasi ya mabangamabanga oyo ezangi neige** (Rocks that protrude from the slopes where snow falls) – While rocks can *contribute* to avalanche risk, they aren't the primary cause described in the passage.
* **C: Motango ya neige oyo eleki na mabwaku ya kotelema makasi** (Layers of snow that exist on rocky slopes) – Similar to B, this describes a feature *related* to the environment, not the unstable snow itself.
* **D: Neige oyo batu basimbi yango te** (Snow that people don’t climb on) – This describes a *reaction* to the danger, not the danger itself.  People avoid unstable snow *because* it’s dangerous, but it's not the defining characteristic.



Therefore, **A** best reflects the core problem described in the passage – unstable, unbinding snow."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, eloko ya malamu esalemi zingazinga ya biloko nini?","The correct answer is **A: Yaourt na mayi**.

Here's why:

* **P** states: ""Na bituka oyo eza na kati na nordi ya Inde mpe Pakistan, basalelaka yaourt mbala mingi na bacurries..."" (In the regions within northern India and Pakistan, they often use yogurt in curries...)
* **P** also states: ""...Curry ekoki koza ya """"kokauka"""" to ya """"mai"""" na kotalela mai oyo eza na kati."" (Curry can use ""coconut"" or ""milk"" to complement what is inside.)

Therefore, the ingredients commonly used to complement curry, as described in the text, are yogurt and milk.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Matiti mpe biloko ya nsolo kitoko** - While ""matiti"" (meat) is mentioned, it doesn't represent a common *complement* to the curry itself.
* **C: Miliki ya mbila mpe misuni** -  ""Miliki ya kokoti"" (coconut milk) is mentioned in *some* regions, but ""mbila"" (vegetables) is not directly highlighted.
* **D: Bandunda mpe miliki** - ""Bandunda"" (potatoes) are mentioned, but not as a primary complement like yogurt or milk.



"
"Na bituka mosusu, basalelaka ntango mosusu miliki ya mbila na esika ya eloko nini oyo basalaka na curry?","The correct answer is **C: Yaourt**.

Here's why:

The text (P) states: ""Na bituka oyo eza na kati na nordi ya Inde mpe Pakistan, basalelaka yaourt mbala mingi na bacurries..."" (In the regions within North India and Pakistan, they often use yogurt in curries...).

The question (Q) asks what else is used in curries in other regions. The text then continues to say in the south of India and other nearby regions, they use coconut milk. However, the *first* alternative mentioned is yogurt.

Therefore, the answer is **Yaourt**."
Mpo na nini esengeli bopengwi ezala zingazinga ya bangomba Transantarctique mpo na komata na plateau?,"The correct answer is **C: Batraktere ya bomoko mpenza ezalaka makasi te** (Tractors of the necessary type are not numerous enough).

Here's why:

The passage states that the route requires powerful tractors that carry fuel and other supplies. It then says the route *needs* to be opened by these tractors *before* vehicles can travel on the Transantarctic Mountains to reach the plateau. This implies a shortage of suitable tractors is the reason for the preliminary work.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mbala mingi, Gare McMurdo ekangamaka** (Often, McMurdo Station is blocked) - While McMurdo can be blocked, the passage doesn't connect this to the *need* to open the route.
* **B: Neige oyo ekangami ezali likama** (The snow that blocks is hard) -  Hard snow is mentioned, but doesn't explain why the tractors are *needed* to initially clear the path.
* **D: Ezali pete koleka kosala mobembo na nzela ya Mbu Ross** (It is impossible to make a detour on the Ross Ice Shelf route) - The passage focuses on the Transantarctic route, not detours.



"
"Na nzela ya Traverse ya Pôle Sud, nini ezali na bilembo ya ba drapeaux?","The correct answer is **C: Ba crevasses etondi na neige** (Crevasses visible in the snow).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Eza neige ya kokangama eza na madusu mpe eza na babendele."" (There is drifting snow and crevasses).  This highlights crevasses as a significant hazard and therefore a key feature of the route.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nzela oyo ezali na Gare McMurdo** (The route is at McMurdo Station) - McMurdo is a *starting* point, not a feature *on* the traverse itself.
* **B: Ba tracteurs oyo ezali kobenda carburant** (The tractors carrying fuel) - While important for the journey, the tractors aren't a *feature* of the route's landscape.
* **D: Ba deviations ya likama zinga ya bangomba** (Deviations due to the shape of the mountains) - The passage mentions avoiding the Transantarctic Mountains but doesn't focus on deviations *within* the route because of their shape.  It focuses on the broader need to navigate around them.



"
Nini elobelami te na mokapo lokola likambo oyo ba touristes basengeli koyeba ntango bazali kotala Afrique ya Sud?,"The correct answer is **B: Kokende kotala na motuka ezali lolenge malamu ya kotala bisika oyo ezali mosika na nzela oyo bato babetaka.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Kokende na motuka na Afrika ya sud eza lolenge ya kitoko ya komona kitoko ya bituka nyonso mpe ya kokende na bisika oyo bato bakendaka kotala mboka-mopaya bakomaka te.""  This translates to: ""Driving in South Africa is a good way to see all the regions and to access places tourists often can't reach.""  It highlights the difficulty of accessing certain areas *without* a vehicle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While visas are mentioned, the passage doesn't focus on the *difficulty* of obtaining them, just that they are needed.
* **C:** The passage implies areas *are not* entirely stable (""Masengami mpe talo ya viza ekeseni na kolanda mboka mokomoko mpe etalaka mboka oyo outi."")
* **D:** While 4x4 is *recommended* for some routes, the passage says you can manage with other vehicles *if* you have appropriate tires – it’s not a universal requirement.  The primary point is the difficulty of accessing areas without *any* vehicle.



"
"Kolandana na bokomi, nini ekotalelama lokola toli ya mabe mpo na ba touristes oyo bazali koluka kotala Afrique ya Sud na motuka?","The correct answer is **A: Biloko mosusu ya mbalakaka na kati ya motuka ekoki kosengama na mobeko.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ekolo na ekolo eza na mibeko na yango na oyo etali biloko ya kosalela na mbalakaka oyo esengeli kozala na kati ya motuka.""  This translates to ""Each country has rules and there are items that must be in the car for customs."" This directly relates to additional requirements *within* the vehicle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While a 4x4 is *recommended*, the passage says you can sometimes manage with a regular car *if* you have the correct tires (4x4 tires).  It doesn't say most roads are passable with a regular car.
* **C:**  The passage doesn't suggest overcrowding the car is a good idea. It focuses on *required* items.
* **D:** The passage specifically warns that *not all* roads in South Africa are good, contradicting this statement.  It says ""Atako Afrika ya sudi eza malamu kasi bamboka nyonso ya zingazinga eza bongo te."" (Although South Africa is beautiful, not all roads are good).



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi elobelami te na mokapo yango lokola likama oyo ekoki kobima ya kotika basaki na yo kozanga ete bátalela yo?","The correct answer is **D: Bakonzi bakoki kotalela bango lokola likama oyo ekoki kobwaka bombe.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ekoki kobenda likebi ya bakonzi mpo bakanisa ekoki kozala na bombe na kati."" This directly translates to ""it can bend the wills of organizers so they can cause a bomb to explode inside.""  This means the organizers (bakonzi) can be controlled *like a mechanism that triggers a bomb*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bakoki koyiba yango:** (They can steal it) - While the passage mentions stealing, it's not the primary danger described. The focus is on control and manipulation.
* **B: Okoki kokóma moto oyo amemaka bangi kozanga ete oyeba:** (You can silence someone who knows a lot so you hear) - This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Bakokaki kobulunganisama na oyo ya moto mosusu:** (They can conspire with another person) - While possible, the passage highlights a more direct method of control - influencing the organizers.



Therefore, option D best reflects the described threat and the way the item (Komibanza mpona basusu) can be used."
Nini elobelami te na mokapo na oyo etali komema bangi?,"The correct answer is **C: Bakokaki kosalela bambwa oyo bamɛlaka bangi kozanga ete báyebisa yango.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bakoki kosalela bambwa oyo balukaki bilangwiseli ntango nyonso kozanga koyebisa liboso."" (They can use dogs that they have trained to smell it and show where it is.)  This directly addresses what helps them find things they are looking for.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Na ba pays mosusu, bato oyo basali mabe mpo na mbala ya liboso bakokaki kozwa etumbu ya liwa** (In other countries, people who are bad for the first time can receive a life sentence) - This is irrelevant to the passage's description of how they *find* something.
* **B: Esengeli kokeba mingi ntango ozali kosala mobembo na mikili mosusu** (You need to look a lot when you are searching through many things) - While generally true, this isn't the *specific* method described in the passage.
* **D: Bakonzi bakoki kobotola basaki na yo, ata soki ozali komema bangi te** (Conspirators can betray you, even if you are not guilty) - This discusses betrayal and is also irrelevant to the main topic of *how they locate hidden things*.



"
Lolenge nini ya masanga elobelami te lokola eloko ya komeka kosala na ndako ntango ozali na congé?,"The correct answer is **A: Jus**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Soki ozomona neti osekisaka bato mingi, zwa libaku ya komela **jus** to biloko basangisa..."" (If you find you are entertaining many people, look for a way to make **juice** or shared snacks...).  This directly answers the question about what is suggested as an alternative when you don't want to cook a full meal during your free time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kafe (Coffee)** - While mentioned at the beginning, it's not a suggestion for what to do when you don't want to cook.
* **C: Masanga (Meals)** - The passage discusses *avoiding* making elaborate meals.
* **D: Ti (Salt)** - Salt is a seasoning, not a meal alternative.



"
"Na oyo elandi, oyo wapi osengeli kokende kotala na ntango ya kofanda soki engumba na yo eyebani mpo na mimeseno na yango ya komela masanga?","The correct answer is **C: Bisika ya komela masanga wapi okendeke mbala mingi te**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""Soki ofandaka na engumba oyo bizaleli ya bato ya komela masanga ekeseni, kende na babare to na banganda oyo okendaka te mingi.""  This translates to: ""If you find yourself in a situation where people often go to get food, especially with friends or family you don't see often.""  This directly points to a place people go to eat *infrequently* with company – a place you don't go to *often*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Esika ya komela kafe libanda ya quartier na bino** (A place to drink coffee near your neighborhood) - The passage focuses on food/meals (masanga) not just coffee.
* **B: Butike ya jus to ya jus esangisami na miliki** (A juice shop or a shop sharing juice with a friend) -  The passage discusses a full meal/snack, not just juice.
* **D: Bisika ya kolia oyo basalaka ti ya camomille** (A restaurant that serves chamomile tea) - This is too specific and doesn't align with the broader concept of a meal with company.



"
Mayemi ya bibenga ezali wapi?,"The correct answer is **A: Na ntaka ya ndambo ya ngonga longwa na mboka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Na nkunda, eza na mayemi ya kitoko ya marbre ya bapizio likolo ya nkunda mosusu. Esengaka katikati ya ngonga moko mpona kotambola na mboka kitoko.""  This translates to: ""On the outside, it has beautiful marble floors from old churches. It is located in the middle of a large cliff to travel to a beautiful village.""  This clearly indicates the marble is on the **floor of the cliff/rock** (ntaka ya ndambo ya ngonga longwa na mboka).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Na lopango ya lingomba:** The passage doesn't mention a roof.
* **C: Na esanga ya Eysturoy:** The passage says the whole structure *is on* Eysturoy island, not that the marble is specifically on the island itself.
* **D: Na kati ya eglise:** The passage says the marble *came from* churches, not that it's *in* a church.



"
Lolenge nini ya visa ekoki kosɛnga moto apesa bilembeteli oyo emonisi ete mbongo ekoki?,"The correct answer is **A: Viza ya mombongo (Immigrant Visa)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**Mpona mikili mingi, okozala na mposa ya mokanda ya koluka bana-kelasi ya esika oyo olingi kokende kotanga, elongo na bilembeteli ya lisungi ya mbongo mpona kokokisa bamposa na yo na mbula ya liboso ya mateya.**""  This translates to: ""In many cases, you will need a letter from the school you want to attend, along with proof of financial capacity to support yourself and your family for the next school year.""  This is directly related to obtaining a visa that allows someone to *permanently* reside (immigrate) in a country, indicated by a ""visa ya mombongo"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Viza mpona kokende kotala mboka mopaya (Visa to return to your home country):** This is about returning *from* a trip, not immigrating.
* **C: Viza mpona baviziti ya mikuse (Tourist Visa):** This is for short-term visits, not permanent residence.
* **D: Viza ya mwana-kelasi (Student Visa):** While mentioned in the passage, it doesn't directly relate to providing proof of financial ability to *permanently* support oneself and family.  It's for the duration of studies.



"
Nani azali na likoki mingi ya kosɛnga visa oyo ebakisami?,"The correct answer is **D: Moto oyo azali kosala mobembo mpo na mombongo** (Someone working for the government).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mbala mingi baviza ya bana-kelasi ezalaka na masengami ekeseni mpe lolenge ya kosala yango ekeseni na koluka viza mpona kokende kotala mboka mopaya to mpona mombongo.""  This translates to: ""Often, student visas are granted and the process of obtaining them requires a visa for a government employee to travel to a paying or foreign country.""

This clearly indicates that someone *working for the government* has a greater ability to obtain visas, as they are involved in the process of getting visas for students.  The passage doesn't suggest tourists, individual travelers, or other students have this advantage.



"
Ntango nini osengeli kotya likebi mingimingi na ngungi?,"The correct answer is **D: Ntango ozali kotambwisa motuka** (When you are driving a car).

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states: ""...kolekisa mwa basegonde moke libanda na baporte ya kofungwama ntango ozokota na motuka eza ngonga mingi po bangungi bamata elongo na yo na motuka.""  This translates to ""...be careful with the sides and doors when you drive a large car because insects will follow you in the car.""

Therefore, the passage directly links checking for insects to the act of *driving* a car.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na ntango ya sanza ya moi makasi** (During the rainy season) - While insects might be more prevalent in the rainy season, the passage doesn't specifically say to check for them *then*.
*   **B: Likolo ya komata ngomba** (When you are cutting grass) - This is irrelevant to the passage.
*   **C: Na zamba ya mbula** (In the rain) - Similar to A, rain doesn't directly trigger the need to check your car, the act of driving does.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, osengeli koboya kosala nini mpo na kokima ngungi ntango ozali kotambwisa motuka na zamba ya mbula?","The correct answer is **A: Kotika baporte ya motuka polele ntango molai mingi** (Check the tire pressure often when it's hot).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly states:** ""...kolekisa mwa basegonde moke libanda na baporte ya kofungwama ntango ozokota na motuka eza ngonga mingi po bangungi bamata elongo na yo na motuka.""  This translates to ""...check the tire pressure often when driving a lot because the tires get hot and expand.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Koleka na motuka na boumeli ya eleko ya molunge:** (Stay in the shade of the forest) - While the passage mentions forests, it's about tire pressure, not avoiding the sun.
* **C: Kotambwisa motuka na bisika oyo ezali na mikili ya molunge:** (Drive on the roads that have shade) -  Again, focuses on location, not the core issue of tire pressure.
* **D: Kotika motuka kozanga mobateli ntango ozali kotambola na bangomba:** (Park the car facing a helper when you are traveling with companions) - This is irrelevant to the passage.



Therefore, **A** is the only answer directly supported by the information in the passage."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na ba affirmation oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali ya solo te.","The correct answer is **D: Ezali ndako ya ba mboloko ya ba tache, mpe baleki ba tigre ya Bengale na ebele.** (It is a habitat for many species of turtles, and home to Bengal tigers.)

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** "" ...sikoyo eza na batigre 400 na Royal ya Bengale mpe pene ya bambuli 30 000 ya matonomatono na etuka wana."" ( ...there are approximately 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer living there.) This directly supports the presence of Bengal tigers and turtles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage mentions turtles, it doesn't emphasize them as the primary inhabitants.
* **B:** The passage mentions the delta and waterways but doesn't state the massive extent is *due to* flooding. It describes it *as* being within a delta/watery region.
* **C:** This is a true statement based on the passage (""mangrove forest""), but it's not the *most* specific detail supported by the text regarding what lives *in* the Sundarbans.



"
Eteni nini ya zamba ezali na kati ya teritware ya Inde?,"The correct answer is **A: Sundarbans National Park**.

The text states: ""Eteni ya zamba na teritware ya Inde babengaka yango parke national Sundarbans."" which translates to ""In the Indian part of the territory, they call it Sundarbans National Park."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Esika ya kobomba banyama ya zamba (Wildlife sanctuary)** - While Sundarbans *is* a wildlife sanctuary, the text specifically names it a *national park* in the Indian territory.
* **C: Esika ya libula ya mokili mobimba (World Heritage Site)** -  The text states Sundarbans is a World Heritage Site, but that's a designation from UNESCO, not the name of the area *within* India.
* **D: plaine gangétique (Gangetic plain)** - The text mentions Sundarbans *was part of* the larger Gangetic Sundarbans, but it’s not the name of the park within India.



"
"Kolandana na bokomi, nani azali na likoki mingi ya kozala na bososoli ata moke ya monoko ya anglais?","The correct answer is **A: Bato oyo balobaka ata minoko mosusu mibale** (People who speak other languages as well).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bikolo mingi balobaka malamu Anglais, mpe na bikolo mosusu bato mingi bayebaka yango mwa ndambu - mingi bilenge."" (Many people speak English well, and in other languages many people use it - many languages.) This directly implies that people who speak *other* languages alongside English are more likely to be involved in the situation described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bato oyo bazali bilenge na mbula:** (People who are young/children) - The passage doesn't mention age.
* **C: Bato oyo bazali kosala mobembo na Toronto:** (People who are having a meeting in Toronto) - While the scenario *involves* people in Toronto, it doesn't say they are *more likely* to be involved.
* **D: Bato oyo bakómi mikóló na mbula:** (People who eat meals every day) - This is a universal action and irrelevant to the passage.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekoki kozala mpasi mpo na kobenga yango?","The correct answer is **A: Maloba na baaccent ekeseni** (Speeches with different accents).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses heavily on people speaking in different accents and languages.** It mentions English, ""other languages,"" and specifically highlights people from different cities (Manchester, Boston, Jamaica, Sydney) meeting in Toronto – implying a variety of accents. The difficulty in understanding is directly linked to this linguistic diversity.
* **Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:**
    * **B: Baadresi (Addresses):** While addresses are mentioned as a problem, it's *because* of the difficulty understanding the speech, not the addresses themselves.  The addresses become hard to use when you can't understand how they are spoken.
    * **C: Maloba oyo ekomami (The speech that is coming):** This is too broad. The problem isn't just that there *is* speech, but the *variety* of speech.
    * **D: Maloba ya kati ya mboka (Speech between countries):** This is a bit closer, but the passage focuses more on individual accents *within* languages, not just the fact that people are from different countries.



The key phrase in the passage ""Eza solo mingimingi po ya ba adrese, oyo mbala mingi ezalaka mpasi na koloba yango malamu."" translates to ""It's a big problem for addresses, which is often difficult to say correctly."" This points directly to the issue of pronunciation and accents."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, eteni nini ekozala malamu mpo na mobembo oyo azali kokana kozwa mutuka uta na esika ememaka ya kati na district?","The correct answer is **B: Moto oyo azali kosala mobembo azali kokende na Bumthang mpe asengeli kolongwa na ngonga ya 7.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""elongwaka na este pe na Jakar/Bumthang, elongwaka na kati ya 06:30 pe 07:30.""  This means buses leave from Este *and* Jakar/Bumthang between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
* **The question asks:** What's best for someone traveling *from* a location *within* the district?
* **Option B** directly links travel originating from Bumthang with the 7:00 AM timeframe mentioned in the passage.  Since the buses leave between 6:30 and 7:30, aiming to arrive *by* 7:00 AM makes sense.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While Jakar is mentioned, the question asks about travel *within* the district, and option B is more directly connected to the provided timing.
* **C:** Paro is mentioned for taxi fares, not bus departures from within the district. The timing is also incorrect.
* **D:** ""Est"" is mentioned, but the context isn’t about *starting* a journey from Este, but rather about buses going *to* Este.  The time is also too specific and doesn’t align with the 6:30-7:30 window.



"
Nini ekozala toli malamu mpo na touriste oyo azali koluka kosala mobembo na est longwa na esika ememaka ya kati na district?,"The correct answer is **D: Taxi oyo bakabolaka ekoki kozala nzela ya mayele koleka mpo na kosala mobembo** (The taxis that are available can be a good way to travel to do the tour).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ba taxi ya bato mingi eza lolenge ya noki mpe ya malamu ya kokende na bisika ya pene, na ndakisa Paro (Nu 150) pe Punakha (Nu 200).""  This directly translates to ""Many taxis are available and are a good and affordable way to travel to nearby places, like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200)."" This indicates taxis are a practical transportation option for tourists.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mituka elongwaka kaka nsima ya 8:30 (Buses only run after 8:30):** The text says buses *mostly* run between 6:30 and 7:30, not just after 8:30.
* **B: Somba tike ya liboso (Early morning ride):**  While the buses *can* be early, this isn't a practical tip for a tourist planning their tour. The text focuses on the availability and cost of taxis.
* **C: Mitukas mingi elongwaka mokolo mobimba (Many buses run every day):** The text states the buses run *mostly* every day, but doesn't emphasize this as a key piece of advice for a tourist.



"
"Na kati ya makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali ndimbola ya sikisiki ya Timbuktu te?","The correct answer is **A: Ezali na influence mingi ya Arabe koleka mboka mobimba** (It has a strong Arab influence compared to other countries).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""mpo aza na mayele migi ya baarabe kasi ya bato ya Afrika te"" - meaning it has many Arab characteristics unlike other African countries. This directly points to a strong Arab influence as a defining characteristic of Timbuktu.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ezali na bobola** (It is ruined) - While the passage says it's a ""engumba ya bobola mpenza"" (a very ruined city), this is a *result* of its history, not a fundamental characteristic.
* **C: Ezali inaccessible na avion** (It is inaccessible by plane) - The passage explicitly states ""ezalaki na aeroport"" (it has an airport), making this incorrect.
* **D: Ezali kaka esika oyo ebendaka bato oyo balingaka koyeba makambo mingi** (It is just a place that attracts people who want to see many things) -  This describes *why* people visit, but not what fundamentally *defines* Timbuktu.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali solo?","The correct answer is **C: Ezali na mayele ya Afrika mingi te koleka bingumba oyo ezali zingazinga.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Engumba eza na bokeseni makasi na bingumba mosusu ya mboka wana, mpo aza na mayele migi ya baarabe kasi ya bato ya Afrika te.""  This translates to: ""The city is very isolated from other cities in the country, because it doesn't have much of the culture of the African people.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bato bakoki kokota na engumba yango na mpepɔ** (People can travel to that city by plane) - The passage *does* mention an airport, so this is true, but it doesn't represent the *sadness* or isolation being described.
* **B: Ezali exotiques koleka pauvre** (It's exotic but poor) - The passage focuses on cultural isolation, not economic status.
* **D: Engumba yango ebendaka lisusu ba touristes te** (The city doesn't receive any more tourists) - The passage says people *used* to travel there but it's now a shadow of its former self. It doesn't say *no* tourists come.



Therefore, option C best captures the core sentiment of sadness and cultural loss expressed in the passage."
Ntango nini masano ya jeux olympiques ya été esengelaki kosalema na ebandeli? ,"The correct answer is **B: sanza ya misato 2020**.

The text states: ""...mayele migi ya ko annuler makambo basali mpona coronavirisi ekosuka te na sanza ya nsambo 2020, dati oyo bakanaki kosala Jeux olympiques."" This translates to ""...decisions to cancel things due to the coronavirus did not happen in November 2020, which is when they were planning to hold the Olympic Games.""

Therefore, the original plan was to hold the games in *sanza ya misato* (July) 2020. They were then postponed and eventually held in 2021.

"Kolandana na bokomi, na ntango nini entonnoir ekómaka mopepe makasi?","The correct answer is **C: Ntango bazali kokita uta na mapata ya mopepe makasi** (When they start looking at the edges of a strong tornado).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ebandaka neti ba entonnoirs oyo ezokita uta na mipepe eza na mapata, pe ekomaka """"mipepe makasi"""" ntango ekomaka na mabele.""  This directly translates to ""It starts with funnels appearing at the edges of the tornado, and is called 'strong tornadoes' when it reaches the ground.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tango mipepe ekomi pene na 100 miles na ngonga (When the tornado is about 100 miles away):** The passage mentions tornadoes can travel 100-200 miles, but doesn't link that distance to the formation of a funnel.
* **B: Ntango makonzí ya mopepe ebandi kobaluka (When the conditions for a tornado start to form):** This is too general; the passage focuses on what *happens* when a tornado is already forming, not the initial conditions.
* **D: Nsima ya kosimba mabele (After touching the ground):** While the passage mentions it's *called* a strong tornado when it touches the ground, the funnel itself appears at the edges *before* that happens.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi ezali ezaleli ya sikisiki ya mopepe makasi?","The correct answer is **A: Bazali ntango nyonso kobimisa mipepe pene na 100-200 miles na ngonga moko** (They always move winds around 100-200 miles per hour).

Here's why:

* **P's text explicitly states:** ""Ebimisaka mipepe ya makasi (mbala mingi 100-200 miles/ngonga)..."" (It causes strong winds (often 100-200 miles/hour)...)  This directly answers the question of where a tornado's strong winds are located - in its movement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mbala mingi, batambolaka na biloko ya kilo** (Often, they sweep through kilogram objects) -  This is irrelevant and doesn't address the *location* of the strong winds.
* **C: Ekomaka ba entonnoir nsima ya kosimba mabele** (They form funnels after touching the ground) - This describes a visual characteristic, not the *location* of the strong winds.
* **D: Ezali makonzí oyo ezali kobalusabalusa oyo etindika mopepe na libándá** (It is a process that spreads and pushes wind into the band) - This is a general description of a tornado's formation, not the *location* of the strong winds.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, epai wapi moto oyo azali kosala mobembo asengeli kozwa toli mpo na makambo ya politiki na engumba oyo azali kokende?","The correct answer is **A: Ewuti na gouvernement ya mboka ba’ko visiter** (Appeal to the government of the country they are visiting).

Here's why:

The passage discusses the need for insurance (political risk insurance) when individuals or companies operate in politically unstable regions. It specifically mentions that Americans in the Middle East might face more risks than Europeans or Arabs.  The passage then highlights that mechanisms for dealing with these risks are often *national* – meaning they relate to the country where the incident occurs.  

Therefore, if someone is facing political risk while operating abroad, the logical first step is to appeal to the government of the *host* country for assistance or protection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kowuta na makanisi oyo elakisami na kati ya toli ya mobembo** (Rely on mechanisms existing within the insurance policy) - While insurance is mentioned, the passage implies broader political factors are at play, requiring more than just an insurance claim.
* **C: Ewuti na bana mboka ya mboka oyo bakozala kotala** (Appeal to the citizens of the country) -  Appealing to citizens is unlikely to be effective in resolving political risks.
* **D: Ewuti na gouvernement na bango moko** (Appeal to their own government) - While their own government *might* offer support, the immediate responsibility and potential for resolution lies with the host country's government.



"
"Soki toli ya mobembo ezwi, nini mwana mboka ya mboka mopaya akoki kokutana na yango te?","The correct answer is **D: Bansango oyo epesami na sikisiki na ntina makambo ya politiki ya ekolo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Makanisi oyo balobelaka ezalaka mbala mingi ya likololikolo, ya bongobongo, pe ya mozindo te soki okokanisi yango na basango ya mozindo oyo eza na bisika mosusu.""  This translates to ""The risks they are talking about are often political, economic, and not covered if compared to risks covered by other insurance policies.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bolongoli ya assurance oyo epesaki makambo mabe:** (Insurance policy that covers bad things) - This is too general and doesn't address the *specific* limitations discussed in the passage.
* **B: Bokusi oyo ezalaki nan se mingi nan tina na makambo ya politiki ya ekolo:** (Difficulty that I have a lot and have with political things of the country) - This is a personal statement not found in the text.
* **C: Assurance maladi oyo ebebisamaki:** (Health insurance that is established) - This is unrelated to the discussion of travel/political risk insurance.



Therefore, option D directly reflects the passage's explanation of what a standard travel insurance policy *won't* cover – risks stemming from political situations in a foreign country."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, lolenge nini ya mobembo ezali na likoki mingi te ya kosenga lisalisi ya kosala réservation epai ya agent ya mobembo?","The correct answer is **C: Mobembo oyo eko présenter barrière ya langue** (A property that presents a language barrier).

Here's why:

The passage discusses difficulties in finding suitable properties, specifically mentioning issues like location, condition (needing repairs), and price. It *also* highlights the potential difficulty when a property's details aren't easily accessible – ""ezala na site internet to na vitre ya fenetre"" (be on a website or in a window display).  A language barrier would *directly* impede access to this information and make it difficult to even begin the process of a reservation through an agent.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Mobembo na likita ya mosala na engumba moko mobembo oyo akendaki kotala liboso** (Property in a remote location that takes a long time to reach) - While remote locations can be a problem, the passage doesn't specifically focus on distance as the main issue.
* **B: Mobembo molai ya poso mibale na budget moko ya sikisiki mpenza** (Property with a high price with a limited budget) - Price is mentioned as a potential issue, but the passage is describing overall difficulties in *finding* a property, not just affording it.
* **D: Mobembo ya liboso ya mobembo na mboka mopaya** (First property of a property in a neighboring country) - This is too specific and not addressed in the text.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na likambo nini moto oyo azali kosala mobembo akozwa matomba mingi soki asalisi mosali ya mobembo?","The correct answer is **A: Ntango mobembo azali kosala réservation ya ba vols ya kokende mpe kozonga mpo na kotala mboka na bango.**

Here's why:

The passage (P) describes travel agents (bakompani ya mibembo) helping people with travel arrangements - flights (ba vols), accommodations (esika bakokende), etc.  It specifically mentions planning trips *for* people.

* **A** directly relates to this – a travel agent making flight reservations for someone going on a trip.
* **B** is about a specialized excursion, which is *a* travel arrangement, but not the primary, overarching reason a travel agent might accumulate frequent flyer miles.
* **C** and **D** are about the *client's* personal reasons for travel, not what the agent is *doing* to earn rewards. The passage focuses on the agent's actions.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekoki kosalisa moto oyo azali kosala mobembo azanga mawa ntango azali kotala bisika ya sika?","The correct answer is **A: Kozela mibeko ya ndenge moko lokola esika oyo bauti**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""...Bizaleli, mibeko, bilei, kotambola, sika ya kolala, malako, lokota pe makambo mosusu ekokesena mwa moke na ndenge eza na esika ofandaka.""  This means customs, traditions, laws, and behaviors *differ* depending on the place you are.  Someone committing a crime needs to understand those different rules.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kolinga komeka bilei oyo oyebi te:**  Trying to understand laws you don't know isn't the *result* of committing a crime, it's something you should *do* before.
* **C: Kokangama na mibeko ndenge moko na esika bawuti:**  This means conflicting with the rules of the place, which is essentially *doing* the crime, not a consequence of it.
* **D: Koboya bolukiluki ya liboso mpo na esika ya kolala:**  This is about avoiding future problems, not what happens when you've already committed the crime.



Therefore, option A directly reflects the passage's point about needing to understand the local customs and laws when you are somewhere new."
"Na kotalela makambo oyo ezali na mokapo yango, moto ya ndenge nini akoki kozala na mawa ntango azali kokende na esika mosusu?","The correct answer is **C: Moto oyo azali na makanisi ya kokangama** (A person who has the intention to adapt).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) emphasizes the importance of not expecting things to be the same as ""back home"" when living in a new place.** It highlights that customs, habits, relationships, and even basic necessities will be different.  It stresses the *need* to adapt.
* **Option C** directly reflects this need for adaptation. ""Makanisi ya kokangama"" translates to ""intention to adapt"" or ""plans to adjust.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Moto oyo alingaka bilei ya exotiques** (A person who likes exotic customs) - Liking exotic customs isn't the same as *adapting* to a new environment. You can appreciate differences without integrating.
* **B: Moto oyo azali kokola malamu na mbongwana** (A person who is well-respected in the village) -  This is irrelevant to the passage's focus on adapting to a *different* place.
* **D: Moto oyo asepelaka koyekola** (A person who went to study) -  Studying abroad doesn't automatically mean someone is able or willing to adapt to a new culture.



**Therefore, the passage strongly suggests that a person who has the intention to adapt (Option C) is best equipped to handle living in a new place.**"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali toli oyo ebongi te mpo na bato oyo bazali kosala mibembo mpo na mbala ya liboso na mboka oyo ezali naino na bozwi mingi te?","The correct answer is **A: Yeba banyama ya mboka liboso ya kolala na mabele** (Beware of local animals when sleeping on the ground).

Here's why:

* **The passage warns against sleeping directly on the ground.** It states ""Kolala te likolo ya matelas to ya coussin na mabele na bisika oyo oyebi te ndenge makambo ya mabele ezalaka"" (Don't sleep on a mattress or cushion on the ground if you don't know what's there).  This directly relates to potential dangers *in* the ground, like animals.
* **The passage emphasizes the dangers of the environment.** It mentions insects and other creatures (""makambo ya mibembo"") and the possibility of being bitten.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Boya kolekisa mbongo mingi na bilei na boumeli ya mwa mikolo na yo ya liboso** (Spend a lot of money on tickets and travel for your vacation) - The passage doesn't focus on cost.
* **C: Ba recommandé mbeto ya mbeto to hamac soki ozali kosala camp libanda** (It is recommended to bring a tent or hammock if you are camping in the bush) - This is a *solution* the passage suggests, not a danger.
* **D: Investir na hôtel ya qualité tango okoya mpo nampo na mbala ya liboso** (Invest in a quality hotel when you travel for tourism on your vacation) -  While the passage mentions hotels as a safe alternative, the question asks about *something that is wrong* or a danger, not a safe option.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi elobelami te lokola likambo ya kolekisa ndelo ntango ozali komesana na mboka oyo ezali naino na bozwi mingi te?","The correct answer is **A: Bilei ya ndenge ya mikili ya mpoto**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""na bilei pe misala ya kitoko po omesana"" which translates to ""and supplies and tools for safety.""  This directly relates to preparing for potential difficulties while traveling in a place with a lot of crime.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ba services ya kitoko makasi (High-quality services):** While the passage mentions good hotels, it doesn't frame them as essential for *safety*.
* **C: Matela to pad mpo na kosala camp (Mattress or pad for camping):** These are comfort items, not safety measures.
* **D: Ba hôtel ya kitoko makasi (High-quality hotels):** Again, hotels are mentioned for convenience, not directly for protection against danger.

The passage is advising to be prepared for a potentially dangerous situation, and ""supplies and tools for safety"" are the most direct response to that need.



"
"Na ba options oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekozala malamu mpo nampo na mobateli ya police oyo alingi kopi oyo ebetami ten a papye ya politiki na ye, kasi akoki kosalela internet te?","The correct answer is **C: Kobatela kopi moko kati na mémoire ya ordinateur moke na bango** (To save a copy in the memory of their computer).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Soki ozosala mobembo na ordinatere ya maboko to tablete, bomba kopi moko na memoire na yango to na diske (esika okoki kosalela yango ata internet eza te)."" (If you create the document on a computer or tablet, save a copy in its memory or on a disk (a place you can access even without internet)).
* The police officer *cannot* use the internet, so options B (email) and D (""lipata"" - likely referring to cloud storage, which needs internet) are not viable.
* Option A (giving a copy on a flash drive) is possible, but the passage prioritizes saving directly to the computer's memory as a reliable offline backup.  Saving *to* the memory is better than relying on a separate device.

Therefore, saving a copy directly to the officer's computer's memory is the most directly recommended solution for someone without internet access, as outlined in the text.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi kati na makambo oyo elandi esengeli te kolakisa na politiki?","The correct answer is **A: Mitango ya telephone ya mokili mobimba mpo na kosenga bafuta** (Mobile phone numbers for contacting beneficiaries).

Here's why:

The text (P) states the need to collect email addresses and *multiple* phone numbers to *contact and inform* those involved (policyholders, beneficiaries, etc.).  It specifically mentions using these for communication.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Addresse email ya motu ya assurance** (Email address of the insurance person) - While email addresses *are* mentioned, the text asks for those of beneficiaries/involved parties, not just the insurance person.
* **C: Mitango ya telephone ya mokili mobimba mpo na ndingisa** (Mobile phone numbers for reminders) - While reminders are mentioned as a *possible* use, the text highlights broader communication (""contacting and informing"").
* **D: Addresse email ya mobateli ya polisi** (Email address of the police officer) - The text doesn't mention needing the police's email address at all.  It's about insurance claims and beneficiary communication.



Therefore, the most directly supported requirement from the text is collecting phone numbers to reach beneficiaries."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, bonene nini ya mabe ezali komonisa lolenge ya filme oyo basalelaka mingi?","The correct answer is **A: 6 x 6 cm ya négatif**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ba apareyi ya foto misusu ya mike esalelaka format 6 cm na 6 cm...Yango esalaka ete eloko wana eza monene mbala minei koleka 35 mm.""  This translates to ""Other medium format cameras use a 6cm by 6cm format...This makes that area much larger than 35mm.""

The question asks for the *largest* negative size used, and 6x6 cm is clearly identified as being significantly larger than 35mm (36x24mm).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 56 x 56 mm ya négatif:** While mentioned, the text says it's achieved *through* using the 6x6 format, not that it's a separate, commonly used format itself.
* **C: 35 mm ya négatif:** The text states this is a *common* format, but not the largest.
* **D: 36 x 24 mm ya négatif:** This is the specific size *within* the 35mm format, again not the largest overall.



"
"Na lolenge ya film oyo elandi, oyo wapi epesaka komonana oyo ekokani na DSLR?","The correct answer is **A: Film ya 35 mm**

Here's why:

The passage states that 35mm film (36x24mm) is often used and can be adapted to work like a DSLR with a modern lens. The question asks which film type is comparable to what a DSLR can use.  DSLRs use sensors that are roughly the size of, or larger than, 35mm film.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Film ya format moyen (Medium format film)** - The passage describes 6cm x 6cm film as *larger* than 35mm, not comparable to DSLR use.
* **C: Film ya 56 x 56 mm** - This is also a larger format than 35mm, and not typically directly comparable to DSLR sensors.
* **D: Filme ya 6 x 6 mm** - This is a typo and probably meant 6x6 cm, which is medium format (again, larger).

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na kati na yango, oyo wapi ekozala litambe ya nsuka mpo na kobanda mombongo ya kokoma mibembo?","The correct answer is **A: Meka kosala formatage ya web** (Start learning web formatting).

Here's why:

* **The prompt (P)** outlines a path to creating a website: learn formatting and web design, then build your own site.
* **The question (Q)** asks for the *next step* after acknowledging the initial advice.
* **Formatting (A)** is the logical next step *after* understanding the potential to build a website but *before* actually building it. You need to learn *how* to format a web page.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kokoma masolo mingi mpo na blog moko ya mobembo oyo eyebani malamu** (Write a lot of content for a popular blog) - This is something you do *after* you have a blog, not as the next step to create one.
* **C: Tongela site na yo moko** (Create your own site) -  You can't create a site without first learning how to format it.
* **D: Bosembola mayele na yo ya kosala montage** (Develop your skills in editing) - Editing skills are useful, but not directly related to the core task of building a website.



"
"Ntango obandi mombongo ya kokoma mibembo, makoki nini na oyo elandi esengeli mbala mosusu kobongisama liboso?","The correct answer is **A: Kosala bablog** (Creating a blog).

Here's why:

* **The prompt (P)** explains that learning to create a blog is a step towards building your own website. It suggests blogging as a starting point for someone who wants to publish content online.
* **The question (Q)** asks what you can do *after* you learn to publish content.  Creating a blog is the most direct next step.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kobongisama ya internet** (Internet publishing) - This is too broad. Blogging is *a type* of internet publishing.
* **C: Kobongola makambo** (Publishing things) -  Again, too broad.
* **D: Bokeli ya site internet** (Website design) - While related, you first need to *publish* content (like through a blog) before you can fully design a complex website.  The prompt suggests starting with blogging *before* tackling full website design.



"
Na lolenge nini ya klima mikakatano ya misɔpɔ ezwamaka mingi?,"The correct answer is **C: Baklimat ya molunge** (Tropical climates).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically discusses diseases prevalent in ""bisika ya molunge"" (tropical regions).** It mentions Delhi fever, Pharaoh's curse, and Montezuma's revenge – all diseases commonly associated with tropical environments.
* The passage links these climates to a high prevalence of microbes and frequent outbreaks of illness.
* The other options don't fit the context:
    * **A: Baklimat ya malili (Temperate climates):** While diseases can occur, the passage focuses on the intensity and variety of illnesses in tropical areas.
    * **B: Baklimat polaires (Polar climates):**  These climates are generally too cold for the types of diseases described.
    * **D: Baklimat ya kokauka (Arid climates):** While some diseases exist in arid regions, the passage emphasizes the abundance of water-borne and food-borne illnesses typical of tropical areas.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, kozala mbala na mbala ekoki komema na immunité ya nini?","The correct answer is **B: Mikrobe ya mboka** (Local microbes).

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses getting sick from things you encounter while traveling (""biloko wana ya mboka"" - things of the country/place).**  It specifically mentions illnesses caused by local microbes – Delhi belly, Pharaoh's curse, Montezuma's revenge. The passage explains that your body isn't used to these microbes, making you vulnerable.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Mikakatano ya misopo** (Muscle cramps) - While discomfort can be a symptom of travel illness, it's not the root cause.
    * **C: Mikakatano ya mpema** (Good microbes) - This is the opposite of what causes the illnesses described.
    * **D: Delhi Belly** - This is *an example* of an illness caused by the microbes, not the broad category of what weakens immunity when traveling.

The question asks what weakens your immunity when traveling, and the passage clearly states it's exposure to *new* (local) microbes.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali litomba ya kosala mobembo na kati ya zone ya Schengen?","The correct answer is **D: Esika passeport esengami te**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...soki otikali na esika oyo, mbala mingi okoki kokatisa bangambo kozanga batala passeport na yo lisusu na bisika batalaka yango.""  This directly translates to ""...if you are in that area, often you can avoid requests to show your passport again at borders.""  This means within the Schengen area, passport checks are less frequent – essentially, there are places your passport isn't required.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Koboya ba demandes ya visa ebele** (Applying for visas in advance) - The passage discusses avoiding checks *within* Schengen, not applying for visas.
*   **B: Kobomba mbongo** (Paying money) - While the passage mentions costs associated with visas, it doesn't link this to the benefit of being in the Schengen area.
*   **C: Koboya bisika mingi ya kotala passeport** (Avoiding many passport control points) - This is a *result* of being in the Schengen area, not the literal benefit described as a ""place where a passport isn't needed.""



"
Nini ekoki kozwama lisusu te na lilita ya Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **D: Bomengo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bozwi ya mingi ya nkuda wana eza lisusu te na kati na yango..."" which translates to ""Many of the objects in that tomb are no longer inside it..."" and then continues to say they are in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.  The text specifically mentions *bomengo* (objects) being removed and placed in the museum.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: mwa biliko ya decoration (decorations of the walls)** - The text doesn't mention the wall decorations being removed.
*   **B: Mutu ya mama (Mother's body)** - The text doesn't discuss the mother's body.
*   **C: Mapeka ya mama (Mother's jewelry)** - The text doesn't discuss the mother's jewelry.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, esika nini ya Vancouver ekosepelisa mingi te mpo na bato oyo bazali kosala mibembo oyo batalelaka ntalo ya biloko? ","The correct answer is **C: Esanga ya Bowen**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Esanga Bowen eza esika kitoko ya kokende na masuwa mokolo moko to na wikende; kuna okoki kosala kayak, kotambola, kosomba biloko na ba boutiques, kokende na malewa pe kosala makambo mingi mosusu.""  This directly describes Bowen Island as a great place for a day trip or weekend getaway with activities like kayaking, shopping, and relaxing – things people doing retail therapy would enjoy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Esanga ya Granville:** While mentioned as a transportation hub *to* Bowen Island, the passage doesn't say Granville Island is a place for retail therapy itself.
* **B: Nzela ya Mbu na Likolo:** The passage mentions enjoying views ""pene ya mbu"" (by the sea) but doesn't focus on a specific trail for shopping.
* **D: Mobeti sifflet:** This doesn't appear in the passage and is irrelevant.

"Nakotala makomi oyo elekiKolandana na bokomi, esika nini ekoki kopesa bato oyo bazali kosala mibembo likambo ya solosolo ya Vancouver?","The correct answer is **A: Esanga ya Bowen**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Esanga Bowen eza esika kitoko ya kokende na masuwa mokolo moko to na wikende; kuna okoki kosala kayak, kotambola, kosomba biloko na ba boutiques..."" (Bowen Island is a great place to visit for a day trip or weekend; you can kayak, hike, shop in boutiques...). This directly answers the question of a place to go for solo adventures near Vancouver.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mobeti sifflet** - This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **C: Na katikati ya engumba Vancouver** - While Vancouver has things to do, the text focuses on *escapes* from the city.
* **D: Esanga ya Granville** - The text mentions Granville Island as a *transportation point* to Bowen Island, not a destination for solo adventures itself.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ntango nini bato oyo basalaka mibembo basengeli kokende kotala Chutes soki bazali koluka bisika oyo ezali kopekisa bango te?","The correct answer is **A: Sanza ya zomi na moko tii na sanza ya misato** (July to October).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Na eleko ya mbula (sanza ya zomi na moko kino na sanza ya misato), mai ezalaka mingi mpe balobwaku ekozala makasi."" (During the rainy season - July to October, there is a lot of water and the spray is very strong.)  This directly links the time period of July to October with high water levels and strong spray, making it the most dangerous time to get close to the falls.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Na ntango ya eleko ya batouriste** (During tourist season) - While tourist season overlaps with the wet season, the passage specifically highlights *when* it's most dangerous, not just when tourists are present.
* **C: Ntango mayi emati** (When the water is calm) - This is the opposite of what the passage describes.
* **D: Na libanda ya eleko ya mbula** (At the end of the rainy season) - The passage focuses on the *peak* of the wet season (July-October) as the most dangerous, not the end.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ezali malamu mpo na kotala Chutes Victoria kati na sanza ya zomi na moko mpe sanza ya misato?","The correct answer is **D: Koboya eleko ya mbula (Avoiding the rainy season)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Na eleko ya mbula (sanza ya zomi na moko kino na sanza ya misato), mai ezalaka mingi mpe balobwaku ekozala makasi. Okozanga te kopola soki okatisi gbagba otamboli na banzela oyo ezala pene ya lobwaku wana.""  This translates to: ""During the rainy season (July to October), there is a lot of water and the currents are strong. You risk not being able to cross the paths near the waterfall.""

Therefore, the best advice for visiting Victoria Falls during July-October is to *avoid* the rainy season.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bimoniseli ya chutes oyo ezipami te (The falls are not accessible):** The passage doesn't say the falls aren't accessible, just that it's dangerous.
*   **B: Batouristes moke (Few tourists):** The passage says it's popular with tourists, implying *many* not few.
*   **C: BBimoniseli ya kokamwisa ya Chutes (Difficulty getting to the falls):** The passage focuses on the danger *at* the falls, not the difficulty reaching them."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi kati na makambo oyo elandi esɛngami te ntango ozali kosalela drone mpo na kokanga ba film?","The correct answer is **D: Ko filmer kaka na ba endroits ebele esika drone ekozala remarquable te** (Only film in safe places where the drone won't be a problem).

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

* **The text warns against flying drones near airports and populated areas.** It stresses that regulations can be problematic even if not explicitly enforced in your country.
* **The core message is about avoiding trouble.**  Filming *only* in places where a drone won't cause issues (safe, remote locations) directly addresses the warning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kotala liboso nini ozali na ndingisa ya ko filmer** (How much time do you have to film) - Time isn't the primary concern highlighted in the text.
* **B: Kozwa ndingisa mosusu** (Get another permit) - The text doesn't focus on permits, but on *where* you film.
* **C: Kosala bolukiluki na mikanda ya ndingisa** (Do research on filming locations) - While research is good, the text is specifically warning about *restricted* locations like airports.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, bisika wapi ezali malamu koleka mpo na kokanga ba film na kosaleláká drone?","The correct answer is **D: Na bisika oyo ozuaki ba permis ya liboso** (In places where you obtain permits easily).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly warns about the legal issues of flying drones, especially near airports and populated areas.**  It states you can get in trouble even if it's *not* illegal in your country.
* **Obtaining permits (ba permis)** is the way to legally operate a drone and avoid those problems. The passage implies you need to be aware of and follow regulations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pene na ebele ya bato oyo bakotungisama te na présence ya drone** (Near people who aren't used to drones) - While avoiding crowds is good practice, it doesn't address the *legal* aspect the passage focuses on.
* **B: Na bisika oyo bapesaka nzela te na kokanga ba foto mbala na mbala** (In places where they don't allow taking photos frequently) -  This is irrelevant to the drone's legality.
* **C: Na bisika oyo bato balekaka mingi, mpe drone emonanaka mingi te** (In places where people leave often, and the drone isn't seen much) -  Avoidance isn't the same as legal operation.  Being unseen doesn't make it legal.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, bisika wapi ezali malamu koleka mpo na kokanga ba film na kosaleláká drone?","The correct answer is **A: Soki ozali kofanda na bisika ya kolala ya batouristes, ekoki kozala ete osengeli te kokomisa nkombo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kasi, yango ezokomisa mobeko mabe koleka, yango wana luka koyeba liboso."" (However, that causes bad situations, so it's important to be careful).  It also mentions people are sometimes allowed to enter without a visa *if* they are tourists and can't easily get one.
* **Option A** directly reflects this – suggesting you might not need a visa if you're a tourist.
* **Why other options are wrong:**
    * **B:** The passage doesn't say *all* situations require a visa.
    * **C:** While the passage mentions police and immigration, it doesn't link this to filming or drones.
    * **D:** Hotels *facilitate* visa processes, they don't generally offer alternatives *to* a visa.

"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali esika oyo touriste akoki kokende te mpo na kosala mosala ya kokomisa nkombo na bango?","The correct answer is **B: Hotel oyo ba’zovanda** (Hotels where they stay).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Na bamboka mingi oyo eza na mobeko wana, bahotel na bango bakipaka mosala ya kokomisa nkombo (kobosana te kotuna).""  This translates to: ""In many of the cases mentioned here, hotels are the ones who handle the process of registering guests (without cost).""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Biro ya bapolisi moko ya mboka** (A police station of the country) - The passage mentions needing to *show* a document to the police, but doesn't say they *handle* the registration.
*   **C: Poste moko ya mboka** (A post office of the country) - Not mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Babiro ya immigration** (Immigration offices) - The passage says you might need to go to immigration *after* the initial registration, not to do the registration itself.

Nani akozwa matomba te soki azali kosala mosala ya bolingo malamu ntango azali kosala mobembo?,"The correct answer is **A: Moto oyo azali na elikya ya kozwa baninga ya sika akosala na mboka mopaya.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kofanda mpe kosala mosala ya bolingo malamu na mboka bapaya eza lolenge malamu ya koyeba bomoi na bango..."" (It also involves doing good work in a paying country that is capable of improving their lives...) This directly implies someone who has the *ability to provide for their families* while doing good work is not someone who will be poor while working.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Moto oyo azali koluka lifuti ya monene (Someone who wears expensive shoes):**  Expensive shoes don't guarantee financial stability.
* **C: Moto oyo azali na elikya ya kozwa mayele ya sika (Someone who has the ability to save money):** Saving money is good, but it doesn't prevent someone from being poor *while* working.  The passage emphasizes being able to *earn* enough to live well.
* **D: Moto oyo akoki kosepela na chambre mpe bilei (Someone who can rent a room and a bed):**  This suggests basic housing, but doesn’t speak to overall financial well-being.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ndenge nini kosala mosala ya bolingo malamu ntango ozali na mboka mopaya ezali na litomba mpo na moto oyo azali kosala mobembo oyo azali na mbongo mingi?","The most appropriate answer, given the context of providing good love/relationship advice and dealing with someone who is financially exploiting another, is **A: Pene na ntango nyonso, bapesaka lifuti** (Always, they offer money).

Here's why:

* **The original text (P) strongly implies financial exploitation is a key warning sign of a bad relationship.**  It mentions someone offering to pay for everything (""kopesa te"" - not just lending, but *always* paying), creating dependency, and ultimately controlling the other person.
* **Option A directly addresses this.** The pattern of constantly offering money is a tactic used by exploiters.
* **Why the other options are wrong:**
    * **B: Mbala mingi ememaka na mabaku ya mosala** (Often it ends in work disputes) - While financial issues *can* lead to arguments, this isn't the core problem described in the text.
    * **C: Bapesaka ntango mosusu chambre mpe bilei** (They offer another time, room and food) -  This is a continuation of the exploitative behaviour, not a solution or indicator.
    * **D: Ekoki kosalisa yo ozwa liyoki ya kotalela makambo** (It can make you feel the desire to control things) - While control is a *result* of the manipulation, it's not the initial indicator.



Therefore, **A** best answers the question of how to recognize a problematic dynamic in a relationship where someone is financially dominating another.  It highlights the *initial* offering of constant financial support as a red flag."
"Nakotala makomi oyo elekiKolandana na bokomi, nini ekoki kotalelama lokola atypique ya mobembo ya moyenne na Walt Disney World?","The correct answer is **C: Kolekisa mobembo mobimba na biloko ya Disney** (Purchasing a package with Disney locations).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""kokende na hotel Disney na bisi, kolekisa pene ya poso moko kozanga kolongwa na lopango ya Disney, pe kozonga na ndako."" This translates to ""staying at a Disney hotel with transportation, purchasing a single price package including a Disney plan, and going to the parks.""  This describes a package deal encompassing multiple Disney experiences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kolekisa poso moko na kotalatala ba parcs** (Purchasing a single price to visit the parks) - While park tickets are part of a Disney trip, the passage emphasizes a *package* that includes more than just park admission.
* **B: Kofanda na hôtel moko oyo ezali libanda ya esika yango** (Staying at a hotel near the location) - The passage specifically mentions staying at a *Disney* hotel, not just any hotel nearby.
* **D: Kozwa bisi longwa na libándá ya mpepo tii na hotel** (Taking transportation from the airport to the hotel) -  Transportation is mentioned as *part* of the package, but isn't the defining characteristic of a typical Disney World vacation package.



"
Na ba affirmations oyo elandi ya Walt Disney World oyo wapi ezali ya solo te?,"The correct answer is **A: Batike ya park-hopper ekoki kopesama na ba voyageur misusu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""okoki te kopesa batike na moto mosusu"" (you cannot sell tickets to another person). This refers to all tickets, including park-hopper tickets.  However, the passage then immediately follows that statement by mentioning people *are* selling them online. This implies park-hopper tickets *are* being transferred, even though Disney prohibits it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ezali na bisika ya kolala na esika yango:** The passage doesn't mention lodging specifically being a problem. It mentions hotels, but doesn't say they're hard to get.
* **C: Ezali na bisi oyo ekoki komema bato oyo bazali kosala mobembo wuta aeroport kino na esika yango:** The passage *mentions* transportation from the airport, but doesn't state it's a problem or something that is easily resold.
* **D: Mbala mingi, bakoki kozwa tike ya mikolo mingi na basite Internet ya ba ventes aux enchères:** This is *true* based on the passage (people *are* selling tickets online), but it doesn’t describe something that’s *not allowed* by Disney – it describes something people are doing *despite* Disney's rules. The question asks for something that is explicitly not allowed.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kolobelama mingi te na kelasi ya formation professionnelle to na mikanda?","The correct answer is **B: Komibongisa mpo na lisalisi ya liboso** (To prepare for a future audit).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where companies in a specific region (bitumba) are often subject to audits.** It states they need to have proper documentation (""formation ya malamu"") and that these audits can take 2-5 days, requiring significant work and resources.
* **""Komibongisa mpo na lisalisi ya liboso""** directly relates to being prepared for this anticipated audit process.  The entire passage is about the necessity of preparation to handle these regular checks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kobika na esobe (To stay calm):** While staying calm is helpful, it doesn't address the core need for documentation and preparation outlined in the text.
* **C: Kozala prêt ya zone ya bitumba (To be ready for the bitumba zone):**  This is too vague. The passage isn't about physical readiness for a location, but readiness for an audit *within* that location.
* **D: Ko jouer role (To play a role):**  This is irrelevant to the context of audits and compliance.



Therefore, **B** is the most logical and directly related answer based on the information provided in the passage."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na mateya oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kozwama mingi na kelasi ya formation professionnelle?","The correct answer is **B: Bisika ya bitumba** (Real Estate).

Here's why:

The passage clearly states the text is about people who work in the ""esika ya bitumba"" (real estate sector) and need training (""formation ya malamu""). The entire passage revolves around this field – finding companies, the length of training, and the challenges faced.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lisalisi ya liboso (Basic accounting):** While potentially useful, the text doesn't focus on accounting.
* **C: Kobika na esobe (Working in a bank):** The passage doesn't mention banking.
* **D: Bisika ya banguna (Construction):**  While related to property, the passage specifically discusses *selling* and *working with existing* properties (real estate) not building them (construction).

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ezali nzela ya malamu koleka mpo na kokima mai oyo ekoki kozala na mikrobe?","The correct answer is **B: Somba mayi ya milangi** (Boil the water).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...soki oza na motungisi, osengeli kosomba mai na molangi ya kokanga euti na kompani moko ya malamu."" This translates to ""...if you are unsure, you should boil the water to ensure safety with a reputable company.""
* **Boiling water is a proven method** to kill microbes and make water safe to drink.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lamba mayi pendant ba minutes ebele** (Shine water for several minutes) - This makes no sense in the context of water purification.
* **C: Lamba mayi pendant minute moko** (Shine water for two minutes) -  Same issue as A.
* **D: Tala mayi mpo na makama ya sikisiki** (Look at water for signs of contamination) - Visual inspection is not a reliable method for detecting harmful microbes.



"
Kobeta mai penepene na ba récifs?,"The correct answer is **B: Kobeta mayi kati na mayi ya mozindo**.

Here's why, based on the text (P):

* The passage describes a dangerous situation where divers are getting lost while trying to follow the current (""mipepe ezouta"").
* It specifically mentions the current carries divers *into* the reefs (""mai oyo ezongaka efandaka na mwa bisika ya mozinda"").
* The passage warns about the difficulty of returning if caught in this current within the reefs.

Therefore, ""Kobeta mayi kati na mayi ya mozindo"" (getting caught in the water *within* the reefs) best reflects the described danger.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kobeta mayi penepene na bitima:**  ""Bitima"" generally means rocks, but doesn't specify the dangerous reefs described.
* **C: Kobeta mayi na sens mosusu:**  ""Sens mosusu"" means another direction, which doesn't relate to the specific reef hazard.
* **D: Kobeta mayi na mayi zingazinga ya mbonge:** ""Mayi zingazinga ya mbonge"" refers to deep, surrounding water, not the specific reef current.



"
Osengeli kosala nini soki okangami na mbonge?,"The correct answer is **C: Beta mayi na ngambo mosusu** (Go to another side of the water).

Here's why, based on the text (P):

The passage describes a dangerous situation with strong currents (""mai makasi""). It warns that people get caught in these currents while trying to cross the river (""bambonge ezobeta na libongo"").  The key advice is to *avoid* being caught in the strong current and to find a different place to cross (""Meka kobima na mbonge na koluka na ngambo mosusu"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Meka kobima na mbonge na koluka na ngambo mosusu, nsima beta mayi lisusu na libongo:**  This adds unnecessary information (""nsima beta mayi lisusu na libongo"" - then go back and cross the river again) that isn't present in the warning. The passage focuses on *avoiding* the dangerous spot.
* **B: Beta mayi mbangu koleka na sens mususu:** This translates to ""Cross the wide water leaving a different direction"", which isn’t a direct solution.
* **D: Beta mayo na nse ya mayi:** This translates to ""Cross with the flow of the water"" which the passage warns *against* as the strong flow is the danger.
