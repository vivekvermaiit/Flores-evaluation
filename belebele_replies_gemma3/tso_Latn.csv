"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini lexi nga ta tekiwa ku nga ri xitsundzuxo lexi kongomeke leswaku u tlanga kositina hi ndlela leyi humelelaka?","The correct answer is **D: Engetela rivilo leri fambisaka xihuhuti ku kuma mpfumawulo wa le henhla ngopfu.**

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Ka kositina, leswaku u kuma mpfumawulo wo engeteleka, u tirhisa xihuhuti hi ku engetela ntshikelelo ni rivilo."" (To improve, in order to get increased control, use practice by increasing concentration and *rivilo* - which translates to 'speed' or 'tempo' in this context).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While increasing control is important, the passage doesn't directly link it to *how* to improve control.
* **B:** The passage doesn’t discuss conserving energy, but rather increasing focus and practice.
* **C:** The passage mentions keeping your head relaxed, but doesn’t present it as the key to improving technique.

"Loko u tlanga kositina, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga ta ku pfuna ku engetela mpfumawulo?","The correct answer is **A: Rivilo leri engetelekeke** (Increased rhythm).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...leswaku u kuma mpfumawulo wo engeteleka, u tirhisa xihuhuti hi ku engetela **ntshikelelo ni rivilo**."" ( ""...to increase expression, use technique by increasing **texture and rhythm**."")

Therefore, increasing rhythm (rivilo leri engetelekeke) is directly mentioned as a way to enhance expression (mpfumawulo).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Matimba lama engetelekeke** (Increased strength) - The passage actually cautions *against* using excessive force.
* **C: Ntshikelelo wutsongo** (Rough texture) - While texture is mentioned, it's alongside rhythm, and ""wutsongo"" implies a negative or harsh texture.
* **D: Ku fambisa rintiho katsongo** (Moving keys forcefully) -  This relates to the caution against using too much force.

Ha yini swifaniso swa le thelevhixini swi tsemiwile ematlhelo hinkwawo?,"The correct answer is **B: Leswaku xifaniso xi tala eka xikirini hinkwaswo** (So that the image fills the entire screen).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that anamorphic widescreen is done ""ku tiyisisa leswaku xifaniso xi tata xikirini hinkwaxo"" (to ensure the image fills the entire screen).  The problem described is that without anamorphic widescreen, the image might be squeezed or have black bars, so the purpose is to make it fill the whole screen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku pfumelela marito lama hlamuselaka vhidiyo** (To allow subtitles to be displayed) - While subtitles *can* be affected, that's a consequence, not the primary *reason* for anamorphic widescreen. The passage mentions subtitle issues as a *problem* that can occur.
* **C: Ku pfumelela ku hundzula loku nga olova eka tifomati tin’wana** (To allow conversion of non-anamorphic formats) - The passage doesn't say this is the purpose; it describes the process of *creating* an anamorphic DVD.
* **D: Ku tsema marito lama hlamuselaka vhidiyo ma va ehansi ngopfu** (To push subtitles too low) - This is again a *problem* that can occur, not the goal of anamorphic widescreen.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiphiqo swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi un’wana a nga langutanaka na swona loko a hundzula muvhi yi va fomati ya DVD?","The correct answer is **A: Xifaniso leswi nga tatiki xikirini hinkwaswo** (An image that doesn't fill the entire screen).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the problem is that when converting to DVD, the image might not fill the entire screen (""hinkwaswo"" meaning ""entirely""). It mentions black bars appearing on the sides, top, and bottom. This is a direct issue with the *image itself* not being properly sized for the screen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Marito lama hlamuselaka vhidiyo lama nga tsemiwa xiphemu** (Subtitles that are cut off) - The passage mentions subtitles *might* be affected, but that's a *result* of the image scaling issue, not the primary problem itself.
* **C: Xifaniso lexi tataka xikirini hinkwaswo** (An image that fills the entire screen) - This is the *opposite* of the problem described.
* **D: Matlhelo lama nga tsemiwa** (Cut edges) - While edges are mentioned as where the black bars appear, the issue is the *image not filling the screen*, not simply the edges being cut off.



"
A yi ri kwihi ndhawu leyi laha masocha ya le Britain a ma rindza kona?,"The correct answer is **C: Bordentown**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Murhangeri nkulu John Cadwalder a a kota ku sungula nhlaselo wa vukanganyisi eka British gamison e**Bordentown**..."" This directly says the British garrison was at Bordentown.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Assunpink Creek:** While James Ewing crossed Assunpink Creek, it was to *avoid* the British, not where they were stationed.
*   **B: Trenton:** Trenton is where the American troops *attacked*, not where the British were initially positioned.
*   **D: Princeton:** Princeton isn't mentioned in this excerpt.



"
A ku ri nsayino wa mani lowu a wu ri eka mpfampfarhuto lowu tsariweke hi voko?,"The correct answer is **D: Charles Thomson**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...mpfampfarhuto lowu tsariweke hi voko lowu sayiniweke hi Murhangeri wa Khongresi John Hancock **swin’we ni Matsalana Charles Thompson**..."". This directly translates to ""...the official declaration signed by President of Congress John Hancock **and Secretary Charles Thompson**..."".

Therefore, Charles Thompson was one of the individuals who signed the official declaration.



"
"Eka tindhawu leti landzelaka, hi le kwihi laha Dunlap broadside yi nga fika ro hetelela?","The correct answer is **C: E Landhani**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kopi yi fike eLandhani hi August 10."" (A copy arrived in London on August 10th).  It also states the broadsides were being distributed, and London is mentioned as the final destination of a copy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E New York:** While George Washington received a copy and ordered it read to his troops in New York, New York was a *stop* in the distribution, not the final destination for all copies.
*   **B: Evhengeleni ro kandziyisa ra Dunlap:** The broadsides were *printed* by John Dunlap, but the question asks where they *arrived*.
*   **D: Eka Independence Hall:** The declaration was proclaimed there, but the text specifies a copy was sent *from* Independence Hall, not that it remained there.



"
Masocha ya Mukolonele Stark a ma ri kwihi?,"The correct answer is **A: Emakumu ya le n’walungwini, etlhelo ka fenisi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vavanuna va Stark va teke tlhelo ra fenisi en’walungu ka mahetelelo ya ndhawu ya vakholonisi...hi xihatla va engetele fenisi hi khumbi ro koma ra ribye en’walungwini ri helela **emakumu ka mati** eribuweni leritsongo.""  This directly places Stark's soldiers at the rear of the westward side, at the edge of the fence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Eribuweni emakun’wini ya mati** - While the river is mentioned, the soldiers aren't *in* the river.
*   **C: Etlhelo ra n’walungu-vuxa bya peninsula** - This is where the fighting initially occurred, but not where Stark's men ultimately positioned themselves.
*   **D: Emahlweni ka fenisi** - Gridley and Stark built a 100 feet defensive line *in front* of the fence, but the soldiers were stationed *behind* it.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, a ku ri rini loko vavanuna va Stark va engetela fenisi ya vona?","The correct answer is **C: Loko ku tlakuka ka mati ya le lwandle ku ye ehansi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Loko ku tlakuka ka mati ya lwandle ku ye ehansi ku siye vangwa eMystic River en’walungu-vuxa bya peninsula, hi xihatla va engetele fenisi hi khumbi ro koma ra ribye en’walungwini ri helela emakumu ka mati eribuweni leritsongo.""  This directly translates to ""When the tide went out leaving mudflats in the Mystic River on the eastern side of the peninsula, they extended the fence with a captured ship that was sailed into the water and anchored.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Loko Vakholonisi va ri karhi va kombela ku tiyisiwa:** While the colonists were seeking reassurance, this doesn't describe *when* they extended the fence.
*   **B: Endzhaku ka loko vanhu lava tolovelekeke va hundze mhandzi:** This describes a *purpose* of the fence (to prevent access when allies approached), not when it was extended.
*   **D: Loko masocha ma yima emahlweni:** The passage mentions soldiers arriving, but it doesn’t say this is when the fence was extended.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i nkarhi wihi eka leyi landzelaka laha a ku ri nguva wa madzolonga ngopfu le Chayina?","The correct answer is **D: Nguva wa Mimfumo Minharhu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hi minkarhi leyi a ku ri na nyimpi ya tihanyi exikarhi ka va le vukosini vo tala lava a va lwela xihundla xa ku fuma a xigodlhweni lexikulu a Xi’an."" This directly links the period of greatest conflict and struggle for power to the ""Nguva wa Mimfumo Minharhu"" (Period of Warring States).  The passage specifically mentions massive battles and competition for dominance around Xi’an during this time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mfumo wa Jin:** While the Jin dynasty is mentioned as one of the states *during* the Period of Warring States, it isn't the period *of* greatest conflict itself.
*   **B: Nguva ya Xi’an:** Xi'an is a location, not a time period. It’s where battles happened *during* the Period of Warring States.
*   **C: Mfumo wa Han:** The Han dynasty came *after* the Period of Warring States.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini lexi nga ntiyiso hi kholoni ya vusokobyi loko byi nghena eka xiyenge xa nomadikhi?","The correct answer is **C: Byi endla tindhawu to tshama leti cinciwaka endzhaku ka masiku ya 17**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Eka xiyenge xa nomadikhi, vusokobyi lebyi kumeka eka tropika a ti macha hi madyambu hi nhlekani ta yima ti dzima matente. Kholoni yi sungula xiyenge xa nomadikhi loko swa kudya swi nga kumeki ngopfu. Eka xiyenge lexi, koloni yi endla tindhawu ta ku tshama bya swi nkadyana leti cinciwaka masiku hinkwawo. Timachi yin’wana ni n’wana ta xiyenge xa nomadikhi ti teka kwalomu 17 ya masiku."" This directly describes the colony creating small living areas that last for about 17 days.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Byi dzima matente nivusiku** - While it does live in tents, that's not the *specific* action it takes *when entering* the nomadic phase.
* **B: Swa kudya a swi kumeki ngopfu** - This is the *reason* they enter the nomadic phase, not what they *do* when they get there.
* **D: Byi macha ninhlikanhi** - This is a general characteristic, not specific to the nomadic phase.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi leswi hlamuselaka kahle mikhuva ya ku endla ndhawu yo tshama ya kholoni ya vusokobyi hi nkarhi wa xiyenge xa nomadikhi?","The correct answer is **A: Byi endla tindhawu to tshama nivusiku**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Eka xiyenge xa nomadikhi...koloni yi endla tindhawu ta ku tshama bya swi nkadyana leti cinciwaka masiku hinkwawo."" This directly translates to ""In the dry season...the colony makes small nesting areas that change every day.""  ""Nivusiku"" means daily or every day.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Byi macha masiku ya 17 handle ka ku endla tindhawu to tshama** - The passage mentions 17 days as the time for a larvae to mature, not the time to create nesting areas.
* **C: Byi cinca tindhawu to tshama siku ni siku** - While the nesting areas *change* daily, the passage doesn't say they are *changing* daily (the act of changing). It says they *are* made daily.
* **D: Byi tirhisa tindhawu leti fanaka ta ku tshama hi nkarhi wa xiyenge** - The passage implies the nesting areas are *not* the same; they are made anew each day.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga ta ya emahlweni hambi ku ri ni swivangelo swa ntumbuluko?,"The correct answer is **B: Mafambiselo ya ntumbuluko**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mafambiselo ya ntumbuluko, lama nga ri ki ndlela ya ku hlamula leswi fanele swi endla ntsena, ma tsariwe hansi la ma swilo swo tala leswi hanyaka ku katsa tibakhitheriya, fungi, swimila na swihari... Leswi lawuraka ku endleka ka swilo swa ntumbuluko hi nkarhi wa swona swa ti endlekela naswona **swi ta ku ya mahlweni hi ku ti endlekelela hambiloko ku nga swilo leswi swi yi rhumaka ku endla tano**.""

This directly refers to the *processes of evolution* continuing and developing over time. The passage is discussing how these processes will continue to unfold.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fambiselo ra ntumbuluko ra le ndzeni ka mirhi** - This is too specific. The passage discusses evolution across all life, not just in trees.
*   **C: Minkarhi ya swilo swa ntumbuluko** - This refers to the *time* of evolutionary events, not the processes themselves.
*   **D: Mafambiselo ya ntumbuluko lama phindha-phindhaka** - While evolution can have repeating patterns, the passage doesn't emphasize repetition specifically. It focuses on the ongoing nature of the processes.



"
I rito rihi leri hlamuselaka vanhu lava kombisaka ku hambana ka xitekela xo karhi?,"The correct answer is **D: Polimofiki**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Loko vanhu va kombisa ku hambana ko hlayanyana eka xilo xo karhi, va yi polimofiki.""  This directly translates to ""When people show variation in a shared characteristic, they are polymorphic.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Monomofiki:** The passage says this term describes people who are *alike* in the shared characteristic.
* **B: Swivumbiwa:** This refers to the 'group' or 'collection' being studied, not the variation within it.
* **C: Tinxaka ta swivumbiwa:** This translates to ""characteristics of the group"" and doesn't specifically address variation.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka i rihi rito leri faneleke ra swivumbiwa leswi tshamaka endhawini yo karhi?,"The correct answer is **A: Monomofiki**.

Here's why:

The passage states that when everyone in the area agrees on a single type of wood for a specific purpose (like building), they are called *monomofiki*. This directly relates to the situation described in the question - everyone using the same type of wood.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nhlengeletano ya swivumbiwa (Collection of plants/organisms)** - This is too general. The passage is describing *how people relate to* a specific resource, not just its existence.
* **C: Tinxaka ta swivumbiwa (Types of plants/organisms)** -  This refers to the different kinds of wood available, but not the agreement or disagreement on which one to use.
* **D: Polimofiki (Polymorphic)** - The passage defines *polimofiki* as showing *difference* in wood choice, which is the opposite of what's described in the question.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga riki xikombiso xa leswi nga endliwa tanihi vupfhumba lebyi seketeriweke eka ntumbuluko?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku khandziya tintshava ku ya eka boboma ra mati**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes activities that *directly impact* the environment and wildlife of a natural area.** This includes things like collecting specimens, observing animals, and learning how ecosystems function.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku teka swinepe swa swiluva swa le khwathini:** This *is* mentioned as an example in the passage.
* **C: Ku vhakela muziyamu ya sayense:** Visiting a science museum is learning *about* nature, but doesn't directly involve interacting with or potentially impacting a natural environment.
* **D: Ku phasa tinhlampfi:** This *is* mentioned as an example in the passage.

**Ku khandziya tintshava ku ya eka boboma ra mati (Disturbing animals to go to a body of water)** is an action that would directly disrupt the natural ecosystem and wildlife, fitting the description of the destructive behavior the passage is warning about. Therefore, it's the only option that isn't an example *of* the destructive behavior, but rather another potentially destructive behavior itself.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga xisekelo xa fambiselo ra swilo leswi fambisaka vanhu?","The correct answer is **B: Timovha ta vanhu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...va nhu va siya ti doroba leti ntsongo hi ti movha ku ya eka tindhawu ta ntirho naswona va hindziwa hi **timovha tin’wana ta vanhu lava va tirha eka tindhawu leti va ti siyeke**.""  This directly links the movement of people to other people's movements, forming a system of transportation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tindhawu ta ntirho (Workplaces):** While workplaces are *destinations* for the movement, they aren't the *basis* of the transport system itself.
*   **C: Ndhawu leyi ku tshamaka swivumbiwa leyi tiyeke (Areas where resources are depleted):** This refers to a consequence of the carbon economy, not the fundamental system of movement.
*   **D: Ku ti endlekela ka vanhu (Human settlement):** Settlement is a result of movement, not the basis of the transport system.



"
Swilo leswi rhendzeleke nyutliliya ti ni muxaka wihi wa chaji?,"The correct answer is **A: Chaji ya Phositivhi (Positive Charge)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ti phurothoni ti na phositivhi elekitiriki chaji kasi ti nyutironi a ti na chaji."" This translates to ""Protons have a positive electric charge, while neutrons have no charge.""  Since the nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons, and protons *have* a positive charge, the nucleus as a whole has a positive charge.



"
Nyutliliya yi endliwe hi swilo swihi?,"The correct answer is **A: Tiporotoni ni tinyuturoni**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Nyutliliya I na swilo swimbirhi - tinyuturoni na tiporotoni."" (The nucleus consists of two things - neutrons and protons.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tinyuturoni ni tielekitironi:** Electrons orbit the nucleus, they are *not* part of the nucleus itself.
* **C: Tielekitironi ni tiphorotoni:**  Electrons are not in the nucleus.
* **D: Tiphorotoni, tinyuturoni, ni tielekitironi:** Electrons are not in the nucleus.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, eka leswi landzelaka i yini xikombiso xa tinomboro leti tirhisiwaka?","The correct answer is **A: 1010**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the numbers used (bits) can only be 0 or 1. 

* **A: 1010** - Contains only 0s and 1s.
* **B: 12001** - Contains the number 2, which is not a bit.
* **C: 10010** - Contains only 0s and 1s, but it's less obvious than A.
* **D: 110101** - Contains only 0s and 1s, but it's less obvious than A.

While C and D are also valid binary numbers, A is the most straightforward example given the explanation in the passage. The passage is explaining the *basis* of binary, and a shorter example like 1010 is better for illustrating the concept.



"
Tinomboro leti tirhisiwaka nakambe ti vitaniwa yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Tibiti**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...naswona tinomborho leti ku vuriwa leswaku i ti nomborho lebyi tirhisiwaka - kumbe tibiti, loko hi tirhisa ririmi ra tikhompyutha."" (and these numbers are called binary numbers - or bits, when using computer language).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tinomboro:** While technically correct (they *are* numbers), the passage specifically gives a different name for them in computer science.
* **C: Marito ya vuthekiniki:** (Technical terms) - This isn't relevant to the core meaning of the passage.
* **D: Mixaka:** (Figures) - This is too general and doesn't relate to the specific type of numbers being discussed.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga vuriwangiki eka ndzimana tanihi ku vuyeriwa ka ku tsala tibulogo ta machudeni?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku antswa ka mapeletelo ni matsalelo** (Addressing challenges and problems).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that blogging helps *antswisa matsalelo ya machudeni* (address students' problems) and that bloggers work to address these issues so they don't escalate. This is a direct benefit mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ku hunguteka ka ku solasoriwa hi machudeni man’wana** (Feeling relieved by being understood by other students) - While blogging *can* lead to this, it's not the primary stated purpose.
* **C: Ku hlalmusela ndhawu ya vona** (Explaining their perspective) - The passage mentions this as a *result* of blogging (through analyzing online content), not the core reason for it.
* **D: Khuthaza machudeni ku dyondza ni loko va nga ri exikoleni** (Encouraging students to learn even when not at school) - This is also a benefit, but again, secondary to the problem-solving aspect highlighted at the beginning of the text.



"
I yini eka swiyenge leswi landzelaka swa ku tsala tibulogo leswi nga tekiwa tanihi ku khuthaza machudeni ku antswisa vuswikoti byo tsala?,"The correct answer is **D: Xilaveko xa moya wo tirhisana** (The creation of a collaborative spirit).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku buloga swi kucetela moya wo tirhisana, no khuthaza machudeni dyondza ni loko va nga ri exikolweni.""  This directly translates to ""Blogging leads to a collaborative spirit, and encourages students to learn even when they are not at school."" This is the most direct benefit of blogging mentioned in the text regarding encouraging students to improve their writing skills.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku hlamula swilo swa le ka inthanete nkarhi ni nkarhi** (Constantly exploring things on the internet) - While the passage mentions using the internet for research, it doesn't present this as the primary way blogging encourages writing.
* **B: Mboyamelo wa ku papalata ku solasoriwa** (The effort to avoid being ridiculed) - The passage mentions avoiding ridicule as a *result* of blogging, not the encouragement *to* blog.
* **C: Ku endla vahlaleri va tshama va tsakela** (Making students stay angry) - This is the opposite of what the passage suggests. It mentions students being *satisfied* (tsakisa) but not angry (tsakela).



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga riki vuyelo bya ku vulavurisana loku nga humeleriki hi nkarhi wun’we eka machudeni? ,"The correct answer is **B: Ku vulavula ni vadyondzisi hi nkarhi un’wana ni un’wana** (Communicating with teachers one-on-one).

Here's why:

The passage states that asynchronous communication (like email or forums) allows students to send questions to teachers *at any time* and receive thoughtful answers, *avoiding the need to meet in person*. This directly contrasts with the idea of real-time, one-on-one communication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku tirhisiwa ka inthanete tanihi xitirhisiwa** (Using the internet as a resource) - The passage *supports* this as a benefit of asynchronous learning.
* **C: Matirhelo lama olovaka** (Favorable conditions) - The passage mentions favorable conditions as a benefit, not a drawback.
* **D: Vulawuri bya rivilo** (Control of the pace) -  The passage highlights that students can control the pace of learning, a positive aspect.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka swiyenge leswi landzelaka swa ku vulavurisana loku nga humeleriki hi nkarhi un’we leyi nga riki yo olova eka machudeni?","The correct answer is **C: Voxokoxoko bya madyondziselo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku pfumelela machudeni leswaku ma tirha hi rivilo ra wona vini va tlhela va lawula **rivilo ra vuxokoxoko bya madyondziselo**.""  This directly links the undesirable one-sided discussion to control over information/educational resources.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rivilo ra ku dyondza** - While related, the passage doesn't state the discussion directly impacts the learning *process* itself, but rather the *information* used in learning.
*   **B: Tiawara ta ku tirha** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Ku tirhisiwa ka inthanete** - The internet is presented as a *positive* tool for accessing information, not the problem.



"
I yini leswi nga vuriwangiki eka ndzimana tanihi leswi munhu a nga swi katsakanya ni xigodlo xa ndhavuko xa le ka malembexikarhi?,"The correct answer is **A: Emigodini ya vabohiwa** (The graves of the oppressed).

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions that the ancient structure ""huma emigodini ya vubohiwa"" (emerges from the graves of the oppressed) and that sounds from the old battles and the spirit of the past come from those graves. This is a direct link established in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lava lwaka va khandziye tihanci** (The shields of ancient warriors) - While shields are *mentioned* as part of the imagery, they aren’t something inherently *wrong* to associate with an ancient structure.
* **C: Vunjhinga** (Witchcraft) - The passage doesn't explicitly mention witchcraft.
* **D: Tinhenha** (Dreams) - Dreams are not mentioned in the passage.



Therefore, ""Emigodini ya vabohiwa"" is the element that the passage indicates shouldn't be associated with the ancient structure, implying a dark or unsettling connection."
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga si vuriwa eka ndzimana tanihi minun’hwelo kumbe mimpfumawulo leyi twiwaka emarhumbini ya xigodlo?,"The correct answer is **B: Nchavo**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the ruins ""echo with the scent of ancient chivalry, the hum of forgotten battles emanating from the depths of the dungeons.""  ""Nchavo"" (chivalry) directly relates to this described scent and feeling within the ruins.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku lwa (War):** While battles are *associated* with the ruins, the passage describes a scent/feeling of chivalry, not war itself.
* **C: Swakudya swa vanhu vo tala (Food of many people):** Food is mentioned as *depicted* in the ruins (images of feasts), but isn't a core element echoing through them.
* **D: Ku ketlaketla ka mikondzo ya tihanci eswiribyanini (The clatter of armor of rival knights):** This is a detail *contributing* to the overall atmosphere, but not the primary element being echoed.



"
I yihi eka leti landzelaka leyi nga nhlamuselo ya kahle ya Kirby Muxloe Castle?,"The correct answer is **D: A ri akiwa ku sivela nhlaselo lowu nga lunghiseleriwa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Mafisitere lamakulu lama nga funengetiwa ya rona ni makhumbi yo lala a nga ta swi kota ku sivela hi nkarhi wo leha nhlaselo lowu nga lunghiseleriwa."" (Large windows were designed with thick walls that could withstand even a planned attack.) This directly supports the idea that the castle was built for defense.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While Lord Hastings commissioned the building, the passage doesn't say the *walls* were specifically designed by him. It says he *started* the building.
* **B:** The passage states the opposite – the country wasn't peaceful, and the castle was needed due to the threat of raiders.
* **C:** The passage says it was built around 1480, so it *did* take time.



"
I swiphemu swihi swa ku akiwa eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga ta tekiwa swi nga faneleki Kirby Muxloe Castle enkarhini lowu nga hlamuseriwa eka ndzimana?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku akiwa loku nga ta sivela minhlaselo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...mafisitere lamakulu lama nga funengetiwa ya rona ni makhumbi yo lala a nga ta swi kota ku sivela hi nkarhi wo leha nhlaselo lowu nga lunghiseleriwa.""  This directly translates to ""...large windows that were constructed with wooden frames were not able to withstand even a planned attack."" This means the construction (the windows) *failed* to provide defense against attacks – it was a weakness in the castle's design.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mafasitere lamakulu (Large windows):** The passage *describes* the large windows, but doesn't say they were a faulty part of the construction. It's their inability to withstand attack that's the problem.
*   **C: Marhangu lamatsongo ku hundza makhokholo man’wana (Conflicts between neighbours):** While the passage mentions the need for defense against raiders, it doesn't say the castle's construction was *faulty* due to neighbourly conflicts.
*   **D: Makhumbi yo lala (Wooden frames):** Like the windows, the wooden frames are a description, not a flaw in the construction itself. It's that the frames didn't provide adequate protection.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga ta va vuyelo lebyikulu eka munhu wa ku tsutsuma loyi a nga lunghiselela nkarhi lowu taka wa ku tsutsuma?","The correct answer is **B: Ku dzika eka ku dyondza ku va ni rivilo hi nkarhi wa vutiolori**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ku tiyisela ku fanele ku dyondziwa eka swilo hinkwaswo."" (to ensure success, it must be learned from all things) and specifically mentions practicing pacing during workouts (""ku tsutsumanyana eka ti ndhawu ta ntumbuluko hi nkarhi wa xixika, swin’we ni ku endla vutiolori bya miri wa le henhla"").  Learning to manage pace (rivilo) during workouts is crucial for improving overall endurance and successfully completing a longer run.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku titoloveta ku tsutsuma eka tindhawu ta ntumbuluko hi ximumu** - While running in varied terrain is mentioned, the passage emphasizes *pacing* during those runs, not just the terrain itself.
* **C: Ku hundza nkarhi wa timinete tinharhu** - The passage mentions two minutes as a benchmark for a half-mile, but doesn’t suggest *focusing* on that time as a goal, rather as an indicator of potential fitness.
* **D: Ku tirhisa ndhawu ya vutiolori ku endla vutiolori bya miri wa le henhla** - This is part of the training *alongside* pacing, but not the biggest benefit for someone trying to improve their time.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka swa nkoka ngopfu eka munhu loyi a tsutsuma hafu ya mayile ya xiyimo lexi tlakukeke?","The correct answer is **B: Ku dyondza ku tiyisela ku tlula rivilo** (Learning to prioritize safety over speed).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ku tiyisela ku fanele ku dyondziwa eka swilo hinkwaswo"" (safety should be learned above all else).  While speed is mentioned (""nga helanga na timinete timbirhi""), the passage *immediately* follows that with the importance of prioritizing safety.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku titoloveta ku tsutsuma eka tindhawu ta ntumbuluko hi xixika** (Practicing running in hilly areas quickly) - This is mentioned as a *way* to improve, not the most important thing.
* **C: Ku fika ku nga helanga na timinete timbirhi** (Finishing in under two minutes) -  This is used to illustrate someone *has* speed, but isn't the core message of the passage. The passage clarifies that speed without safety is insufficient.
* **D: Ku dyondza rivilo ku tlula ku tiyisela** (Learning speed over safety) - This is the *opposite* of what the passage advocates.

"Eka munhu wa ku tsutsuma, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga ta fikeleriwa ntsena hi ku dya kahle?","The correct answer is **A: Ku antswa ka vuswikoti bya ku tsutsuma** (Being skilled at wrestling).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku dya kahle ntsena a ku nge endli munhu a tsutsume kahle ngopfu, kambe ku yi khumba ngopfu vuswikoti bya ku tsutsuma kahle eka vatsutsumi la vantshwa.""  This translates to: ""Eating well alone doesn't make a person a good wrestler, but it greatly improves wrestling skills for young wrestlers."" 

Therefore, good nutrition *improves* wrestling skills (antswa ka vuswikoti bya ku tsutsuma).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku tsakela hi ndlela leyi engetelekeke** (Being appreciated in an increasing way) - While the passage mentions wrestlers being pleased, it doesn't say good nutrition *causes* this appreciation.
* **C: Vuswikoti bya ku tsutsuma bya xiyimo xa le henhla** (Wrestling skills of a higher level) - This is too general. The passage focuses on *improving* skills, not just having higher-level skills.
* **D: Ku tshama u tiyerile hi ndlela leyinene** (Being very tired) - The passage mentions being tired, but it's a side effect of training, not a benefit of good nutrition.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi ku nga riki ndlela leyi nga ringanyetiwa ya vatsutsumi lavantshwa leswaku va tsakela ntlango wa vona hi laha ku engetelekeke?","The correct answer is **B: Va tshama va antswisa vuswikoti bya ku tsutsuma byi va bya xiyimo xa le henhla.**

Here's why:

The passage states that young swimmers who *train intensely* and *understand different ways to improve their technique* are more likely to improve and enjoy competition.  This intense training and technique improvement are what lead to better performance and enjoyment (feeling ""satisfied with the results"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku dya kahle (Eating well):** While important for overall health, the passage doesn't specifically link good nutrition to *enjoying competition*.
*   **C: Ku nwa mati kahle (Drinking water well):**  Important for hydration, but not directly connected to enjoyment of competition in the text.
*   **D: Ku tshama u ri ni ku ringanisela ka matimba (Being fit/having endurance):** While fitness is helpful, the passage emphasizes *how* they train (technique, intensity) more than just being fit.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ha yini mutsutsumi wa ndhawu leyi nga lehanga naswona yi nga komanga a nga xavaka xitirhisiwa lexi durhaka ngopfu?","The correct answer is **B: Xi nga va pfuna**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vatsutsumi va nga twa nga ku va hlawula switirhisiwa hambiloko swi nga pfuni nchumu."" This translates to ""Users can be charged reasonably for the tools.""  This directly implies a user *can* use the durable tool, but it might not be free – it might cost money (""nga pfuni"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I leswi va swi lavaka:** The passage doesn't say users *need* to use the durable tool. It just says it's available.
* **C: Xi ta cinca ndlela leyi va nga vatsutsuma ha yona:** While the passage mentions the tool can change *how* someone climbs, it doesn’t say it's the *reason* a user might not use it.
* **D: Swi tele swilo leswi nga riki ntiyiso leswi vuriwaka hi xitirhisiwa lexi nga durhiki:** This refers to the inherent risks of climbing, not why someone might *choose* not to use the durable tool.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ku laveka yini leswaku u tsutsuma eka ndhawu leyi nga lehanga naswona yi nga komanga?","The correct answer is **A: Switirhisiwa swo tala** (Many tools).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Switirhisiwa swi nga xaviwa hi ndlela leyi swi laveka ha yona, kambe swi yi cinca ka ntsongo kumbe swi nga yi cinci ndlela leyi munhu a tsutsu ma ha yona."" This translates to: ""Tools can be used in the way they are needed, but they change it slightly or they change the way a person feels when they weave.""  Furthermore, it mentions weavers can be paid for tools.

This directly implies that *tools* are necessary for weaving in this specific area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku va ni ndhavuko wa mintlango lowu nga humelela** (Having a history of successful weaving) - While a history might exist, the passage focuses on the *need* for tools, not the history itself.
* **C: Switirhisiwa leswitsongo ngopfu** (Very expensive tools) - The passage does *not* state the tools are expensive, only that weavers can be paid for them.
* **D: Mali yo tala** (A lot of money) - Money is mentioned in relation to *paying* for tools, but it’s not a requirement *to* weave.

I mani loyi a nga kuma nuclear magnetic resonance? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch na Purcell**.

The text states: ""...leyi kumiweke hi va 1930 hi Felix Bloch (a tirha eYunivhesithi ya Stanford) na Edward Purcell (ku suka eYunivhesithi ya Harvard)."" This directly credits both Bloch and Purcell with the discovery of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Purcell:** While Purcell was involved, Bloch was also a key figure.
*   **B: Damadian:** Damadian built upon the discovery of NMR to apply it to medical imaging (MRI), but he didn't discover NMR itself.
*   **D: Block na Purcell:** This is a misspelling of ""Bloch"" and still isn't the complete answer."
Hi lembe rihi laha ku nyikeriweke patente ya ku sungula medical imaging resonance? ,"The correct answer is **A: 1977**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Malembe ya mune endzhaku ka kwalaho u nyikiwe patente, leyi yi veke yo sungula ku humesiwa eka dyondzo ya MRI."" and then directly follows with ""Hi 1977, Dr. Damadian u hete ku endla sikenara xo sungula xa “mirhi hinkwawo” xa MRI..."" This clearly indicates the patent was granted *before* 1977, and 1977 is when he built the first full body scanner, using that patent.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi vanhu va faneleke va swi twisisa ngopfu leswaku va kota ku twisisa swiendlo swa vanhu van’wana?","The correct answer is **B: Leswi va swi lavaka** (What they desire).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**Eka swilo leswi hinkwaswo, ku twisisa leswi vanhu va swi lavaka i swa nkoka ngopfu.**"" (Of all things, understanding what people desire is very important.)  The rest of the paragraph explains *why* understanding desires is important – it helps you interpret their behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Leswi va nga swi navela** (What they dislike) - The passage doesn't focus on dislikes as the key to understanding behavior.
* **C: Leswi va swi tshembaka** (What they believe) - Beliefs are important, but the passage prioritizes understanding desires.
* **D: Leswi va nga swi anakanyaka** (What they think) - Thoughts are relevant, but again, desires are presented as the primary key to understanding.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ku twisisa leswi va swi lavaka ku pfuna vanhu leswaku va endla yini?","The correct answer is **A: Ku susa ku nga tiyiseki hi swiendlo** (To reduce uncertainty about behaviour).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that understanding what others desire ""allows us to interpret a multitude of behaviours."" The examples given (wanting to hear someone's voice vs. losing their own voice) demonstrate how knowing *why* someone is acting a certain way helps us understand their behaviour, removing ambiguity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku vhumbha leswi va nga swi navela** (To guess what they dislike) - The passage focuses on *desires* (what people want), not dislikes.
* **C: Ku languta vanhu van’wana handle ka ku avanyisiwa** (To judge others without understanding) - The passage argues the *opposite* – understanding is crucial to avoid misjudgment.
* **D: Ku kota ku vona leswi van’wana va swi anakanyaka** (To be able to see what others think) - While understanding desires can *inform* our understanding of thoughts, it's not the primary benefit described. The passage focuses on behaviour.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga nkatsakanyo lowu kongomeke hi xikongomelo-nkulu xa AI?","The correct answer is **C: Ku longoloxa** (Recognizing).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Swikombiso swi katsa ku lawula, ku hlela na **ku longoloxa**, vuswikoti by hlamula swivutiso swa vaxavi, hambi kuri ku vona laha ku tsariweke hi voka, rito ni xikandza."" (Examples include controlling, planning and **recognizing**, being able to solve complex problems, as well as seeing where things are done with voice, writing and images.)

The paragraph is listing examples of what AI can do, and ""ku longoloxa"" (recognizing) is one of those examples, directly related to the core capability of AI to process information and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi ko tala swi fambisiwaka ni AI?","The correct answer is **A: Vuswikoti byo hlamula swivutiswo swa vaxavi** (The ability to answer questions from learners).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Swikombiso swi katsa ku lawula, ku hlela na ku longoloxa, **vuswikoti by hlamula swivutiso swa vaxavi**, hambi kuri ku vona laha ku tsariweke hi voka, rito ni xikandza."" 

This directly identifies answering learner questions as something AI does. The other options are also mentioned, but answering questions is specifically listed as an example of AI's capabilities.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Vanhu lava nga ni miehleketo ya muxaka lowu va anakanya hi vutlhari, va swi kota ku nhlokohata muxaka ma miehleketo, ku lulamisa swiphiqo ni ku tirha hi swikambelo swa sayense.""  This directly translates to ""People with a critical mind can understand the nature of critical thinking, resolve conflicts and work with scientific principles.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku kota ku kuma tinhlamulo leti kongomeke to tala ta xiphiqo (Being able to find many correct answers to a problem):** The passage emphasizes there *isn't* one correct answer, which contradicts this option.
* **B: Ku tirhisa tindlela letintshwa eka xiphiqo (Using new methods for a problem):** While critical thinking might *lead* to new methods, it's not the defining characteristic mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Va teka nkarhi wa vona ku tlhantlha xiphiqo (They take time to thoroughly analyze a problem):** This is a component of critical thinking, but not the core ability the passage highlights – understanding the *nature* of critical thinking itself.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""**Mhaka nkulu eka ndlela leyi yo ehleketa i rivilo, vutlhari ni ku pakanisa, ni ku kumisisa mintiyiso...**"" (A key aspect of this approach is reflection, research and analysis, and *establishing principles/assumptions*...).  This directly links establishing principles to the method of critical thinking described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku twisisa leswaku ku na nhlamulo yin’we ntsena** (Understanding that there is only one answer) - The passage explicitly states the *opposite*: ""**Yinhla ya nkoka swinene ya miehleketo leyi hileswaku: ku hava nhlamulo yin’we leyi kongomeke.**"" (A key characteristic of this thinking is: there is no single correct answer.)
*   **B: Ku teka nkarhi** (Taking time) - While critical thinking *can* take time, the passage doesn't highlight it as a core component.
*   **D: Ku hlengeleta rungula** (Being objective) - While objectivity is *related* to critical thinking, the passage specifically mentions establishing principles as a more central element.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ku fambisiwa ka xikandza loku tekeka timillsekoni to hlayanyana."" This directly refers to processing speech very quickly. The passage then explains how difficulties with this process can occur, linking it to understanding the nuances of language. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku khwanyanisa xikandza** (Comparing sounds) - While sound discrimination is part of language processing, the passage focuses on *understanding* the meaning, not just distinguishing sounds.
* **C: Ku tsopeta hi xihatla** (Speaking with an accent) - This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Ku pfumela** (Agreeing) - This doesn't relate to the speed of speech processing.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""**Ngopfu-ngopfu, ku vuriwa leswaku munhu a nga swi kota ku vona loko munhu a hemba hi ku twisisa ku languteka ka xikandza kahle.**"" This directly addresses the ability (or inability) to perceive something when understanding a fleeting gesture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku tirhisiwa ka vhidiyo ku vange mintshubulo ya nkoka** - This is mentioned, but not related to the specific point about perception and fleeting gestures.
*   **C: Ku twisisa mavulavulelo ni ku languteka ka xikandza** - While the passage talks about both, it doesn't say these are *not* true with understanding fleeting gestures. It's about the *perception* of the gesture itself.
*   **D: Ku kota ku kambisisa leswi humaka embilweni hi ku kongoma** - This refers to a method used by people with certain neurological conditions, but isn't a statement about what is *not* possible with understanding fleeting gestures.

I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga va swa nkoka ngopfu hikwalaho ka Ndzhundzunuko? ,"The correct answer is **B: Ku hangalasiwa ka vutivi** (The understanding of knowledge).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Entiyisweni, Ndzhundzunuko wu endle ku cinca lokukulu eka **ndlela ya ku dyondza ni ku hangalasiwa ka vutivi**"" (In essence, Ndzhundzunuko greatly changes the way of learning and **understanding of knowledge**).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku tsundzuka ka munhu** (Human memory) - While mentioned, the passage states human memory is *not* the primary change Ndzhundzunuko brings.
*   **C: Ku tsundzuka ndzimana** (Animal memory) - The passage specifically contrasts this with human memory, stating it's less important.
*   **D: Ku kuma rungula** (Acquiring skills) - This is mentioned as different from how Ndzhundzunuko impacts learning.



"
"Hikwalaho ka Ndzhundzunuko, a ku kandziyisiwa yini katsongo eka leswi landzelaka?","The correct answer is **C: Ku tsundzuka ndzimana**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""vuswikoti bya ku tsundzuka ndzimana yi leswi nga langutiwa."" (the abilities of abstract thought are those that are valued).  And then it says Ndzhundzunuko focuses on changing the importance of abstract thought in learning and understanding information.  This directly links Ndzhundzunuko to valuing and changing *ku tsundzuka ndzimana* (abstract thought).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku tsundzuka ka munhu (human thought):** While related, the passage specifically focuses on *abstract* thought.
* **B: Ku kuma vutivi (gaining knowledge):** The passage mentions gaining knowledge, but Ndzhundzunuko's impact is on *how* we gain knowledge through changing the focus on abstract thought.
* **D: Ku hangalasiwa ka rungula (understanding of a problem):**  This is a *result* of the change in learning, not the focus of Ndzhundzunuko itself.

I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga kombiki nhlohlotelo wa ku tirhisa inthanete eka vuxaka lebyi hambetaka?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku hlangana ni vanhu lavantshwa** (Meeting new people).

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""Ku katseka ka munhu” ni “vuxaka lebyi hambetaka” (loneliness and persistent relationships) were identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) *when studying young adults on websites*. This directly links to the idea of forming relationships and meeting people online, potentially alleviating loneliness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku hlangana hi mabindzu** (Meeting in person) - The passage discusses online interaction, not physical meetings.
*   **B: Ku tshama u vulavurisana ni ndyangu** (Staying to discuss with friends) - While maintaining existing friendships can be *supported* by the internet, the passage doesn’t focus on this.
*   **C: Ku lavisisa hi ku teka maendzo** (Exploring by taking visits) - This doesn’t relate to the context of loneliness and relationships mentioned in the text.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga kombiki nhlohlotelo wa ku tirhisa inthanete eka ku katseka ka munhu?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku tsala leswi u swi lavaka eka mbulavurisano wa le ka inthanete** (Sharing what you seek in online relationships).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that **“Ku katseka ka munhu” (personal connection)** was identified as a dimension of online engagement by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when studying user behavior on websites.  Sharing what you seek in online relationships directly relates to forming those personal connections.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku lava rhisipi (Finding recipes)** - This is a practical use of the internet, but doesn't connect to the concept of personal connection.
*   **C: Ku lavisisa switirhisiwa swa nhlayiso wa rihanyo (Understanding the uses of communication technology)** - This is a broader concept about technology itself, not the specific dimension of personal connection.
*   **D: Ku lawula timali (Managing finances)** - This is a transactional use of the internet, unrelated to forming relationships.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ku ya emakumu ya Malembe ya le Xikarhi Yuropa vupela-dyambu yi sungule ku endla xitayela xa yona."" This directly translates to ""Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to create its own style.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hi nguva wa Byzantine** - The text says Byzantine influence *preceded* Western Europe developing its own style.
*   **C: Hi malembe ya 25 endzhaku ka Malembe ya le Xikarhi** - While the text mentions styles taking 25-30 years to develop, this isn't when Europe *started* its own style.
*   **D: Hi malembe xidzana ra vu-11** - The text mentions the 11th-14th centuries as the period of Xitayela xa Vugoth, but doesn’t say that's when Western Europe started its own style.

The passage states: ""Wun’wani wa nhluvuko lowukulu wa nkarhi wa lowo hi xi vangelo xa tinyimpi ta nkutsulo vanhu va sungule ku tirhisa tikunupu ku boha swiambalo."" This directly translates to ""One of the major developments of that period was that, due to the Crusades, people began to use needles to make clothes.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Enkarhini wa Vugoth** (Gothic period) - While the passage mentions the Gothic period, it doesn't link needle use *to* the Gothic period, but rather states it emerged *within* it.
*   **B: Nguva wa Byzantine** (Byzantine period) - The passage mentions Byzantine influence, but not as the cause of using needles.
*   **D: Malembe ya le Xikarhi** (Middle Ages) - This is a broad timeframe and doesn't specifically explain the reason for the change in clothing production.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hambiswiritano, loko hi nga lavi ntlhantlho wa xinkadyana, hi fanele hi kuma rimitsu ra swiphiqo, naswona hi fanele hi ti tsuvula."" This directly translates to ""However, if we encounter a small problem, we must find the roots of the problems and we must solve them."" This clearly identifies finding the roots of problems as the key action when facing challenges (like those related to the environment).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku yirisa eka hi mahanyelo ya vulovolovo ya vanhu** (To deal with human population growth) - While mentioned as a contributing factor, it's not the *action* taken to address problems.
* **B: Ku yima ni lava lwelaka ku sirheleriwa ka mbango** (To stand with those who are concerned about the environment) - This is about solidarity, not solving problems.
* **D: Ku va vaseketeri va mbango** (To be environmental protectors) - This describes a role, not a specific action to take when a problem arises.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hambiswiritano, loko hi nga lavi ntlhantlho wa xinkadyana, hi fanele hi kuma rimitsu ra swiphiqo, naswona hi fanele hi ti tsuvula."" (However, if we love the small detail, we must find the secrets of questions, and we must open them.) This directly links loving detail to uncovering the *rimitsu ra swiphiqo* - the secrets/answers to questions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku nghenelela eku yimeni ni lava lwelaka ku sirheleriwa ka mbango** (Getting involved in standing with those who are affected by pollution) - This is mentioned, but not presented as a solution for understanding the questions/problems surrounding pollution.
* **C: Ku vulavula leswi hleketiwaka hi mahanyelo ya vulovolovo ya vanhu** (Discussing what is caused by human development) - This is part of the broader context, but not a specific action to address the questions.
* **D: Ku hanya hi ndlela ya xinghana na mbango** (Thinking about how to deal with pollution) - This is the initial problem being addressed, not a solution to finding answers.

The text explicitly states: ""Nyimpi ya Xikhundlha xa ku Fuma ya Spaniya a ku ri masungulo ya nyimpi yo sungula leyi mhaka leyikulu ya yona a ku ri vulawuri lebyi pimiweke.""  This translates to ""The Spanish Succession War was the beginning of the first major war whose issue was the asserted right to rule.""  The passage directly links this war in Spain to the broader struggle for dominance and control over European states – a struggle *not* primarily about religion at its outset.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E Nghilandhi (England):** While England was involved in European conflicts, the passage doesn't identify a major initiating war there related to the core issue of asserting rule.
*   **B: E Jarimani (Germany):** Germany (or the Holy Roman Empire) was a *battleground* in many of these wars, but not the origin of the initial power struggle described.
*   **C: E Portugal (Portugal):** Portugal was involved in colonial conflicts but isn't highlighted as the starting point of this specific power dynamic.

The passage states: ""Hikwalaho, Nyimpi ya Malembe ya Makumenharhu a ku tava nyimpi yo hetelela leyi a yi ta vitaniwa hi leswaku i ya vukhongeri.""  This directly translates to ""Therefore, the Thirty Years' War was the final war that would be known as a war of religion.""

*   **B: Nyimpi ya Malembe ya Dzana:** This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Nyimpi ya Xikhundlha xa ku Fuma ya Spaniya:** The text identifies this as the *beginning* of major conflicts, not the final ""war of religion"".
*   **D: Nyimpi ya Xin’wana-manana ya Spaniya:** This isn't mentioned in the text.

I swiyenge swihi eka leswi landzelaka swa Kereke ya Khatholiki leswi nga si kambisisiwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku va ni matimba endzeni ka Kereke** (The Church having power).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Enkarhini lowu wa matimu ya le Yuropa, Kereke ya Khatoliki, leyi a yi fumile ni ku va ni matimba, yi ve ehansi ka nkambisiso."" (The Church of Europe, the Catholic Church, which was accepted with power, is under scrutiny.)  This directly highlights the Church's power as something being questioned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Xana ku va ni rifuwo endzeni ka Kereke a swi fanerile** (Should there be wealth within the Church?) - While the passage mentions the Church's wealth and its use, it doesn't question *if* there should be wealth, but *how* it should be used.
*   **B: Xana vupfumeri bya xisekelo bya vukhongeri byi fanele ku cinciwa** (Should the fundamental principles of religion be changed?) - The passage discusses the application of principles (helping the poor, using wealth ethically) not the principles themselves.
*   **D: Xana vupfumeri bya xisekelo bya Kereke a byi fikeleriwa** (Are the fundamental principles of the Church being fulfilled?) - The passage suggests there's a *failure* to live up to those principles, but not a questioning of the principles themselves.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani loyi a nga dlayiwa le Versailles?","The correct answer is **D: Murindzi**.

The passage states: ""Hi nkarhi un’wana xirho xa ntshungu u dziwite nhloko ya murindzi wa le vuhosini loyi a nga dlayiwa a Versailles emahlweni ka Nkosikazi yo chuha."" This directly translates to ""At one point, the crowd seized the head of the guard of the palace who was killed at Versailles before the Queen's eyes.""



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi swi nga sindzisiwaka eka Hosi ni Nkosikazi hi ntshungu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku pfula mafasitere ya kalichi ya vona** (To shout at the windows of their carriage).

The passage specifically states: ""Ntshungu wa vanhu u sindzisi Hosi ni Nkosikazi leswaku va pfula hi ku helela mafasitera ya kalichi ya vona."" (The crowd did not spare the King and Queen from shouting at the windows of their carriage).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku huma hi xihatla le Versailles** (Leaving the palace of Versailles) - The passage states they *left* Versailles, it doesn't say the crowd hindered them from doing so.
* **C: Ku langutiwa ka ku dziwitiwa ka nhloko ya murindzi** (The display of the severed head of the guard) - While this is mentioned, the passage doesn't say the crowd *prevented* them from seeing it, only that it happened before the Queen.
* **D: Ku vuyela a Paris** (Returning to Paris) - The passage says they were *forced* to return to Paris, not that the crowd stopped them from doing so.

I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi a ku nga si vuyelo bya nyimpi ya Britain yo kala swipimelo ya swikepe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku navela ka Jarimani ku tirhisa rhengu ra nyimpi leri fanaka**.

Here's why:

The passage states that if the rule wasn't stopped, Germany would retaliate by doing the same thing – targeting enemy ships with submarines. This directly relates to Britain's initial action and the potential for escalation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku vangela khombo ni le swikepeni swa vukala-tlhelo** - This is a *result* of the rule, not the British action that Germany might copy.
* **C: Ku cinca nawu lowu amukeriwaka hi vanhu hinkwavo** - The passage mentions changing international law, but this isn’t what Germany would specifically *do* in retaliation.
* **D: Ku sivela switirhisiwa swa nkoka** - This is a general action taken by Britain, not the specific rule Germany would mirror.



"
I swiga swihi leswi nga hlamuseriki kahle ku sivela ka Britain swikepe swa Jarimani?,"The correct answer is **A: Yi tlule nawu lowu amukeriwaka hi vanhu hinkwavo** (It violated international law accepted by all people).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...hambiloko ku sivela loku a ku tlula nawu lowu amukeriwaka hi vanhu hinkwavo lowu nga tsariwa ku tirhisiwa mintwanano ya matiko hinkwawo ya malembe-xidzana mambiri la hundzeke.""  This directly translates to ""and violating international law accepted by all people that could be used for relations between all countries of the twentieth century.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yi hlohlotele nyimpi ya Jarimani ya swikepe swa le hansi ka mati** (It frustrated Germany's submarine warfare) - While the action *prevented* Germany from doing this, the passage doesn't say Britain's actions were *intended* to frustrate it, only that Germany might retaliate.
* **C: Yi kavanyete ku nghena ka switirhisiwa swa Jarimani** (It prevented the entry of German supplies) - The passage mentions preventing the entry of *ships*, not specifically supplies.
* **D: Yi tiyisekise leswaku swikepe swa vukala-tlhelo swi va ekhombyeni** (It ensured that enemy ships were at the mercy of...) - The passage mentions ships being vulnerable, but not that Britain *ensured* that outcome.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani hakanyingi loyi a nga kamberiwaka Multiple Sclerosis?","The correct answer is **A: Wansati loyi a nga ni malembe ya 32**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vulavisisi vu kume leswaku vasati va nga MS hi laha ku phindhiweke ka mbirhi ku na vanuna."" This translates to ""Research shows that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.""  While the passage doesn't give a specific age, it highlights women as being more susceptible. Option A is the only one that fits this demographic.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B & D:**  While women are more susceptible, 15 and 10 are too young to be the most likely age group based on general MS onset.
*   **C:** Men are *less* likely to get MS than women, according to the passage."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, vanhu lava a va nghenelela eka swilo leswi endliwaka va lava ku seketeriwa hi ndlela leyi engetelekeke hikwalaho ka yini?","The correct answer is **A: Miehleketo leyi nga riki kahle ya ku twa ku vava**.

Here's why:

The passage states that people who aren't used to dizziness want support *in a way that gradually increases* so they can compare feeling dizzy to feeling well while moving around. This implies they want support to *manage* the bad feeling of dizziness (miehleketo leyi nga riki kahle ya ku twa ku vava) and learn to distinguish it from normal sensation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Emhlana:** While the passage mentions dizziness from motion sickness (""emhlana""), it doesn't say this is *why* they want gradual support.
*   **C: Vuvabyi bya miehleketo:** This refers to the feeling of dizziness itself, not the reason for wanting support.
*   **D: Nchavo:** This refers to fear, which isn't the primary reason stated for wanting a gradual approach to support.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, fensing yi tlangiwa njhani?","The correct answer is **D: Wu tlangiwa hi vanhu vambirhi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hakanyingi ntlangu lowu wu tlangiwa hi vanhu vambirhi,mutlangi lowun’wana a lwa ni mutlangi lowun’wana."" This directly translates to ""Usually this sport is played by two people, one fencer fighting against another.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ntlango wa manguva lawa** - This just identifies the sport (fencing) but doesn't explain *how* it's played.
* **B: Le yunivhesithi** - This only states where fencing is practiced, not how.
* **C: Eka mimphikizano ya Olimpiki** - This states where fencing is competed, not how it's played.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga ta komba ngopfu leswaku ku ni chefu leyi ngheneke endzeni?","The correct answer is **D: Khontayina ya mirhi** (A container of trees).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Xikombiso lexikulu xa chefu leyi ngheneke endzeni ku nga va khontayina leyi pfulekeke ya mirhi kumbe ti khemikhali ta le kaya leti nga ni chefu."" This translates to ""A large example of a concealed fire could be a container of trees or household chemicals with fire.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku hlamba timbilu na ku hisa ka miri** (Washing objects and sprinkling with water) - This describes fire suppression, not a concealed fire.
* **B: Ku hlanta ni ku dzuka nyuku** (Planting and smelling smoke) -  While smoke indicates a fire, planting doesn't relate to *concealing* one.
* **C: Swirhumbana leswikulu ni xitlhavi ekhwirini** (Large gatherings and high temperatures) - These are just general conditions and don't point to a hidden fire source.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini goza ra ku sungula leri faneleke ra ku kamba munhu loyi a kumeke khombo?","The correct answer is **A: Kambisisa eka ndhawu ya khombo** (Investigate the crime scene).

The passage states: ""Ku Kamba munhu loyi a kumeke khombo, u fanele u rhanga hi ku kambisisa eka ndhawu leyi ya khombo..."" which directly translates to ""When investigating a person who committed a crime, you should start by investigating the crime scene...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tshinela eka munhu loyi a weriweke hi khombo** (Empathize with the victim) - While important, this isn't the *first* step.
* **C: Kamba ku yima ka munhu loyi a weriweke hi khombo** (Investigate standing with the victim) - This doesn't make sense in the context of the passage.
* **D: Rindzela mpfuno** (Look for clues) - This is part of investigating, but the passage specifically highlights investigating the *scene* first.



"
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga kombiki hi ku kongoma ndlela ya ku kamba munhu loyi a kumeke khombo?,"The correct answer is **C: Xiya ku yima ka munhu loyi a weriweke hi khombo** (Stand with the person who has been affected by the trauma, as if mirroring them and everything that indicates it).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""U fanele u xiya ku yima ka munhu loyi a weriweke hi khombo tanihi u tshinela ka yena na xin’wana ni xin’wana lexi ku lumkisaka."" This directly translates to ""You should stand with the person who has been affected by the trauma, as if mirroring them and everything that indicates it.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: U nga karhateki hi ku vaviseka ka wena** (You shouldn't be overwhelmed by your own feelings) - While self-care is important, this isn't the *primary* action the passage advises.
* **B: Kambisisa ndhawu ya khombo u nga si ya eka munhu loyi a kumeke khombo** (Assess the trauma scene and don't leave it with the person who experienced the trauma) - The passage mentions assessing the scene to ensure safety, but doesn't say to *leave* it with the affected person.
* **D: Ringeta ku vona xin’wana ni xin’wana lexi ku lemukisaka** (Try to see everything that indicates it) - This is part of the process of ""standing with"" the person, but not the main action itself.

I ku cinca kwihi loku nga hlohloteriwa hi Nhlunga-vuhosi wa le Furwa loku nga ni nkucetelo lowukulu eka vatirhi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku suka eka ku sekeriwa ka mintlawa ku ya eka ku sekeriwa a mahanyelweni.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Nhlunga-vuhosi wa le Furwa nakambe wu susumete mintlawa yo tala ya vatirhi vo tikeriwa va mitiko ma n’wana ku sungula minhlunga-vuhosi ya vona."" This translates to ""The Furwa Council has also promoted a large number of junior staff to positions of seniority."" This is a significant change impacting workers directly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nseketelo lowukulu etikweni (Great support in the country):** While the passage mentions supporting a country ""of the people,"" it doesn't frame this as a *change* implemented by the Furwa Council.
* **C: Ku tirhisiwa ka dyondzo ya Riphabliki (Use of Republican education):** This is mentioned as a philosophical shift, but not something *done* by the Council to affect workers.
* **D: Mafambiselo lamantshwa ya metric (New metric systems):**  This is a mention of a societal change, but not directly linked to the Furwa Council's actions related to workers.



"
"Endzhaku ka Nhlunga-vuhosi wa le Furwa, ku humelela eka vusocha ni mintirho yin’wana a swi nga endleki ngopfu leswaku swi sekeriwa eka yini?","The correct answer is **B: Mintlawa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nhlunga-vuhosi wa le Furwa nakambe wu susumete **mintlawa** yo tala ya vatirhi vo tikeriwa va mitiko ma n’wana ku sungula minhlunga-vuhosi ya vona."" This directly translates to ""The Furwa Council also promoted a large number of junior staff before their own councils.""  This means promotion (mintlawa) is what was being done to help people advance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku humelela** (Success) - While success is mentioned as a benefit, it's not *what* the council was actively doing.
*   **C: Ku navela** (To be skilled/experienced) - This is a characteristic people might have, but not something the council provided.
*   **D: Vuswikoti** (Employment) - Employment is a general state; the text specifies *promotion* within employment.



"
I ndlela yihi leyi tirhisiwaka ya ku famba leyi nga tisa swirilo ngopfu eka matiko lama fumeke?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku basa ka mati (Using water)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...matiko lama fumeke swa kala ku twa vanhu la rilaka hi ku basa ka mati nayi kuwa ka tiboloho."" This translates to ""...developed countries were seen by people suffering through using water and building dams.""  The passage then links this to causing a lot of problems (""swirilo swo tano"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku akiwa ka tiboloho (Building dams):** While mentioned alongside water usage, it's presented *as a result of* the water usage issue, not the primary cause of the problems.
* **C: Swilo swa ku fambisa vanhu (Means of transport):** The passage discusses transport in general, but doesn't identify it as the *main* source of problems in developed countries.
* **D: Dyondzo (Education):** Education isn't mentioned in the context of causing problems in developed countries within the passage.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi nga vuriwa hi swilo swa ku fambisa vanhu?","The correct answer is **C: Swi vanga swirilo ngopfu eka lava va swi tirhisaka** (It causes a lot of problems for those who use it).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hikwalawokahini swilo swa ku fambisa vanhu swi tisa swirilo swo tano, hikwalawokahini swi tsandzeka masiku hinkwawo?""  This directly translates to ""Frequently, means of transport cause a lot of problems, frequently they break down every day?"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Swi rhandziwa hi vanhu hinkwavo lava va swi tirhisaka** (It is liked by all people who use it) - The passage doesn't state people *like* it, only that they *use* it.  It also highlights the problems associated with it.
* **B: A swi bihanga ngopfu ku fana ni ku basa ka mati** (It doesn't cost much like working with water) - The passage mentions the cost of transport in relation to working with water and boats, but doesn't say transport itself is cheap.
* **D: A swi hakeriwi eka matiko yo tala lama fumeke** (It is not available in many developed countries) - The passage says developed countries *have* transport, it doesn't say it's unavailable.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga tikaka ku swi vona hikwalaho ka ku nga tivi ndlela leyi vachayeri va tikhomaka ha yona?","The correct answer is **A: Rivilo ra nkwetlembetano (The curvature of the path)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Leswi tisaka ku vava hikuva, ku dyondza ndlela ya ku herisa nkwetlembetano swa tika hikuva awu nge yi vumbi hi ku tiyiseka ndlela leyi muchayeri ati khoma ha yona.""  This translates to: ""This is difficult because learning to predict trajectories is challenging since we don't always know the path the mover will take.""

Later, it explains that understanding the ""curvature"" of the path (rivilo ra nkwetlembetano) is important for understanding the trajectory, and is one of the key features used in the analysis.  The passage specifically highlights that without knowing the path, prediction is difficult.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku hleriwa ka ndlela (Path construction):** The passage discusses analyzing existing paths, not *creating* them.
* **C: Ku tirhisiwa ka ndlela (Path usage):** This is too general. The passage focuses on *understanding* the path, not simply its use.
* **D: Nkhuluko wa Nkwetlembetano (Trajectory origin):** While mentioned as a general aspect of analysis, the passage highlights curvature as the specific element that's hard to determine without knowing the path.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi tirhisiwaka loko ku kombisiwa nkwetlembetano hi mathematiki?,"The correct answer is **C: Mpfahampfarhuto wa ndlela**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...swi nga koteka ku yi kombisa hi **ndlela leya yi nga tiyisekangiki ngopfu eka mathematiki**."" This directly translates to ""...it can be demonstrated by a **method that is not fully guaranteed in mathematics**.""  The passage then goes on to list three key characteristics used to *describe* that method (or approach): ku khuluka (variation), ntiko (intersection), and rivilo (circulation).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku tirhisiwa ka ndlela (Use of a path)** - While paths are *part* of the concept, the passage isn't about simply using a path, but how the relationship between paths is mathematically represented.
* **B: Ku tikhoma ka muchayeri (Muchayeri's presence/location)** -  The passage discusses the importance of understanding a traveler's path but doesn’t state this *is* the mathematical representation.
* **D: Ku tala ka nkwetlembetano (Counting the intersection)** - Counting intersections is a *characteristic* of the method, not the method itself.



"
Hershey na Chase vatirhise yini leswaku va hoxa DNA ya vona? ,"The correct answer is **D: Tivharasi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hershey na Chase va tirhise tifeji, kumbe tivharasi, leswaku va hoxa DNA ya vona eka bakhtheriya."" This translates to ""Hershey and Chase used viruses, or bacteriophages, to introduce DNA into bacteria.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fosforasi ya ku va ni miseve (Phosphorus labeled):** While phosphorus *was* used to label the DNA, it wasn't the tool used to *deliver* it.
*   **B: Xilo xa xitekela (Genetic material):** The experiment aimed to prove DNA was the genetic material, it wasn’t the method used to transfer it.
*   **C: Salfa ya ku va ni miseve (Sulfur labeled):** Sulfur was used to label the protein, not the DNA.



"
Leswaku ku cinca ka xitekela ku hundziseriwa eka vana ku titshege eka yini?,"The correct answer is **B: Nkoka wa xiphemu xa ti gene**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...nkoka wa xiphemu xa ti gene leti cinceke ni leswaku tisele leti khumbhekeke i tisele ta rimbewu.""  This directly links the importance of the gene sequence to how seedlings develop. The passage then contrasts safe changes (in seedlings) with dangerous changes (in other areas).  Therefore, the safety of changing seedlings is tied to the gene sequence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Loko tisele ku ri ta switsongwatsongwana** - While the passage mentions seedlings, it doesn't say the changes are specifically safe *because* they are small.
*   **C: Muxaka wa ku cinca ka xitekela** - The passage discusses the *result* of changing seedlings, not the reason *why* it's done.
*   **D: Loko ku cinca ka xitekela ku nga vanga kufa ka tisele** - This is a consequence of safe changes, not the reason *why* changes in seedlings are safer.

"Hi ku ya hi rungula leri nga nyikeriwa eka ndzimana, switandzhaku swo hambana swa ku cinca ka xitekela a swi titsheganga eka yini?","The correct answer is **C: Nkoka wa xiphemu xa ti gene lexi nga khumbeka** (The importance of a gene segment that is inherited).

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the challenges of gene editing and the differences between editing germline cells (those that produce eggs and sperm - and therefore are heritable) versus editing other cells. It states that altering germline cells has consequences for future generations (""tisele leti khumbhekeke i tisele ta rimbewu""). The passage is *specifically* concerned with the implications of editing inherited genes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I xiphemu xi ngani xa ti gene leti nga khumbeka** (How many gene segments are inherited) - The passage doesn't deal with *quantity*, but with the *impact* of altering inherited segments.
* **B: Xana tisele leti nga khumbeka i ta switsongwatsongwana** (Are inherited cells small?) - This is irrelevant to the passage's content.
* **D: Muxaka wa ku cinca ka xitekela lowu nga khumbeka** (The reason for editing inherited cells) - While the passage *mentions* editing inherited cells, it focuses on the *consequences* and *dangers* of doing so, not the reasons *why* someone would.

I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki xivangelo xa ku ri ha yini mindhavuko ya khale a yi ri ni timbuti?,"The correct answer is **C: A ti va nyika vunakulobye**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ancient cultures *did* give meat, grain, and eggs as offerings. However, it specifically says they didn't give **vunakulobye** (literally ""fruit,"" but in context, likely referring to produce/crops in general) as offerings.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A ti va nyika nyama:** The passage says they *did* offer meat.
* **B: A ti famba eka tindhawu ta madyelo:** The passage describes how the offerings were used, not whether people traveled to find food.
* **D: A ti va nyika meleka:** The passage says they *did* offer grain.



"
Xikongomelo xa golufu i ku teka nhlayo ya le hansi ya yini?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku cikinya nhonga**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mutlangi loyi a nga na nhlayo ya le hansi yoba, **kumbe ku cikinya nhonga**, ku fikela ntlangu wu hela wa hlula."" This directly translates to ""The player who doesn't have a good lie, **or hits the ball**, until the ball is holed.""

Therefore, the purpose of golf is, among other things, to hit the ball (cikinya nhonga). The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tibolo** - Balls are *hit* in golf, they aren't the goal themselves.
*   **C: Nkarhi** - Time isn't the primary goal.
*   **D: Timbhovo** - Holes are where you *finish*, not the purpose of the game.



"
"Endhawini ya ku tlanga golufu, hi le kwihi laha mabyanyi ma tsemiwaka ma va lamatsongo?","The correct answer is **B: Eka rihlaza** (On the green).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...mabyani lama nga ekusuhi na mbhova ma tsemiwa ya va lamatsongo naswona ya vitaniwa rihlaza."" This translates to ""...the greens near the holes are planted with grass and kept green.""  Therefore, the greens (mabyani) are kept green.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eka mbhovo wa khume nhungu** (On the tee box) - The tee box is where players *start* a hole, not where the greens are.
* **C: Eka mbhovo wo sungula** (On the first tee) -  Again, this is just the starting point.
* **D: Eka xiyenge xo sungula xa ntlango** (On the first part of the course) - Too general; the question asks specifically about where the greens are.



"
I yini xikongomelo-nkulu xa xikambelo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku susa xilo kumbe swilo leswi ehleketiwaka** (To remove unwanted things/matter).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...xiringanyeto i xikambelo lexi tirhiselwa **ku susa xilo kumbe swilo leswi ehleketiwaka**, ku vutisa swivutiso, ku kambela ni ku kongomisa vulavisisi bya sayense.""  This directly translates to ""...experimentation is a tool used **to remove unwanted things/matter**, to ask questions, to manipulate and to confirm scientific understanding.""

While experimentation *contributes* to the other options, the passage specifically identifies removing unwanted elements as *what the tool (xiringanyeto/experimentation) is used for*.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini lexi nga pfuniki ku kongomisa vulavisisi bya sayense?","The correct answer is **A: Ndlela ya sayense ntsena** (The scientific method itself).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ndlela leyi yi yona leyi kongomisa vulavisisi bya sayense byo tala."" which translates to ""This method is the one that establishes/grounds most scientific understanding.""  It explicitly identifies the scientific method as the foundation of scientific inquiry.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku xiya leswi endliwaka** (What is done) - This is too vague. While observation is *part* of the scientific method, it isn't the core thing establishing understanding.
* **C: Ku susa swilo leswi ehleketiwaka** (Removing questionable things) -  This describes a step *within* the scientific method (testing hypotheses, eliminating errors), but isn't the method itself.
* **D: Ku kambela** (To question/ask) -  Questioning is also a part of the method, but not the whole thing.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi leswi nga riki ntiyiso hi swihuhuri?","The correct answer is **A: Swihuhuri swi kota ku onha swilo hinkwaswo leswi hlanganaka na swona.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states directly:** ""Swihuhuri swi nga onha swilo hinkwaswo leswi swi hlanganaka na swona."" (Swihuhuri can destroy everything it encounters.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the passage says swihuhuri are strong, it doesn't say they *are* a dangerous place when compared to other forces of nature. It says they *become* dangerous when compared.
* **C:** The passage mentions *some* strong swihuhuri take a long time to form, but not that *most* do.
* **D:** While the passage states some swihuhuri reach 300mph, it doesn’t say this is a general characteristic of all swihuhuri.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tipesenti timbirhi ta swihuhuri leswi swi na matimba ngopfu swi teka nkarhi wa ku hindza eka tiawara ti nharhu."" (Two percent of the most powerful hurricanes take time to form over the oceans.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage says 480 *km/h*, not miles per hour.
* **C:** The passage says it *covers* a large area, not that it *is* a large area.
* **D:** While true according to the passage, this isn't what the question is asking about – it’s asking about something *powerful* hurricanes do specifically.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vanhu a va endla va tlhela va tirhisa tilense ku andzisa marito madzana ya malembe."" (People began to use lenses to see things far away).  It then mentions telescopes were made in Europe in the 16th century.  Therefore, the initial development was *using* lenses.

* **B: Ku andzisa swilo swi vonaka swi ri swikulu** (To see things that are small and large) - This is a *result* of using lenses, not what they started doing.
* **C: Ku endla tilense** (To make lenses) - The passage doesn't say they *started making* lenses in the 16th century, only that they started *using* them.
* **D: Ku endla titeleskophu** (To make telescopes) - Telescopes came *after* the initial use of lenses.



"
I nkarhi wo tanihi kwihi vanhu va ri karhi va andzisa swilo swi vonaka swi ri swikulu?,"The correct answer is **B: Loko ku hela lembexidzana ra vu 16**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Titeleskophu tama sungulo bya ntiyiso ti endliwe eYuropa loko ku hela lembexidzana ra vu 16."" This directly translates to ""The first reflecting telescopes were made in Europe at the end of the 16th century.""  The question asks *when* people started making things that could see far and large, and the passage links that to the end of the 16th century with the invention of these telescopes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Malembe ya gidi** - ""Many years"" is too vague and not specifically mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Magidi ya malembe** - ""Centuries"" is too broad. The passage points to a specific time *within* a century.
*   **D: Loko ku sungula lembexidzana ra vu 16** - ""At the beginning of the 16th century"" is the opposite of what the passage states.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, bakwa ra Muhammad ri nyika xifaniso xa njhani hi mimboyamelo ya yena ya moya?","The correct answer is **A: U teka ku rhula ku ri ka nkoka na ku tihambanisa ni van’wana** (It takes tranquility to be important and to compare with others).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bakwa hi vu rona, leri tshameke ku fika nkarhi lowu, ri nyika xifaniso xo xiyeka xa mimboyamelo ya Muhammad ya moya."" (This tradition, continuing to this day, provides a clear example of Muhammad’s spiritual struggles.)  It then describes Muhammad withdrawing to a cave (""Hira"") to contemplate. This suggests a deliberate seeking of solitude and inner peace to focus on spiritual matters – tranquility. The passage also highlights his different experience compared to others (""loko yi tshame a henhla ka yin’wana ya tinshava en’walungu Mecca, bakwa ri hambane hi ku helela ni misava hinkwayo"" – when it happened above one of the mountains outside Mecca, people differed in their perception).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pongo leri humaka ehandle ri nga pfuna ku anakanya** (An external voice encourages contemplation) - The passage doesn't mention an external voice. It's Muhammad *seeking* contemplation himself.
* **C: A lava nkarhi lowutsongo a ri wexe** (He loves a time of loneliness to be vast) - While he seeks solitude, the passage doesn't emphasize *loving* loneliness but rather using it for spiritual focus.
* **D: A vilerisiwa hi ku voniwa ni ku twiwa** (He is disturbed by being seen and heard) - The passage doesn’t suggest he's disturbed by others, but that his experience is different from theirs.



"
"Hi ku hi ndzimana, nsimbi yi tirhisiwele yini ku sungula?","The correct answer is **A: Ti Crossties**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ti Crossties ti sungule ku tirhisiwa ku nga si ya kwini leswaku ti khoma ndlela."" This translates to ""Crossties were first used to hold the road together.""  The text then goes on to explain how iron was initially used *with* the crossties, eventually replacing them altogether.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tindhawu to famba tigolonyi (Colonial roads):** While the passage discusses colonial roads, iron wasn't *first* used for the roads themselves, but to support them via crossties.
* **C: Mavhilwa (Spikes):** Spikes came *after* the initial use of iron with crossties.
* **D: Swiporo (Rails):** Rails were introduced even later, in 1767.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ha yini mavhilwa ya tihunyi ma sive hi mavhilwa ya nsimbi?","The correct answer is **D: A ma onhiwa hi nsimbi ya swiporo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Eku heteleleni, mavhilwa ya tihunyi ma sive hi mavhilwa ya nsimbi."" This directly translates to ""In the end, the wooden pegs were replaced with iron pegs.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A ma endla tihanci ti tsutsuma swinene** - While the text mentions the desire to make tracks stronger, it doesn't say the wooden pegs *caused* this.
* **B: A ma tirhiseke kahle ngopfu** - The passage implies the opposite; wooden pegs weren't ideal when weight was added.
* **C: A ma kota ku rwala ndzwalo lowukulu** - The passage states the goal was to *manage* a large load, but doesn't say the wooden pegs were capable of doing so.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini lexi a xi vumba vanhu hi nkarhi wa Vuromanticism?","The correct answer is **D: Ndhavuko** (Heritage/Origin).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""A mongweni wa Vuromanticism, **ndhawu yi vumba vanhu**, kambe hi ku famba ka nkharhi mikhuva ni ndhavuko yo fambisana ni ndhawo yoleyo yi humelerile...""  This directly translates to ""In the spirit of Romanticism, **place shapes people**, but over time and heritage associated with that place is appreciated...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Milawu (Laws):** The passage states that Romanticism doesn't want rigid laws *imposed* on people, it doesn't say laws *shape* people.
*   **B: Ntivo-misava (Experiences):** While experiences are important, the passage specifically highlights the role of place and heritage.
*   **C: Mikhuva (Time):** Time is mentioned in the context of heritage *developing*, but it isn't the direct shaper of people according to the passage.

I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga kombiki mianakanyo ya ntolovelo ya ku pima hi ku tirhisa thekinoloji? ,"The correct answer is **C: Thekinoloji yi khumba vanhu hi ndlela ya mfuwo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...thekinoloji hi hala tlhelo yi “khumba” vanhu hi ndlela ya mfuwo..."" This means technology subtly influences people, often without them realizing it, in a way that benefits those in power.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Thekinoloji yi khumba vanhu hi ku ya hi mahanyelo** - While the passage mentions people's choices, it doesn't say technology *directly* manipulates them based on those choices. It's more about a broader influence.
* **B: Nhluvukiso wa thekinoloji a wu khumbiwi hi nhlohlotelo wa ndhavuko** - The passage says the opposite - that technological development *is* influenced by cultural values.
* **D: Nhluvukiso wa thekinoloji a wu sekeriwanga eka nhlohlotelo wa politiki** - The passage states that technological development is *not* independent of political considerations.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga fambisaniki ni ku koka vurha?","The correct answer is **A: Mpfumawulo lowutsongo**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Kususumeta vurha swi endla mpfumawulo lowutsongo, loko ku koka vurha ku ni matimba swinene kambe ku ni nsusumeto."" This translates to ""Pushing the bow creates a soft sound, while pulling the bow has more strength but also more support.""  

The question asks what *doesn't* align with pulling the bow. A soft sound (mpfumawulo lowutsongo) is a result of *pushing* the bow, not pulling it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Xikombiso xi fana ni xinsimbana xo hlanganisa maphepha** - This describes the ""down bow"" symbol and is related to pulling.
* **C: Mpfumawulo wa matimba** -  The text directly connects pulling the bow with strength.
* **D: Ku sungula a ncileni** - The text states you begin at the bottom when pulling the bow.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi fambisanaka ni mpfumawulo lowutsongo?","The correct answer is **A: Xikombiso xa down bow**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kususumeta vurha swi endla mpfumawulo lowutsongo..."" (Pushing the bow creates a smooth sound).  It then directly links this to the ""down bow"" technique.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku koka vurha** (Pulling the bow) is described as having more power but less smoothness.
* **C: Xikombiso xa ku languteka ku fana ni V** (The ""up bow"" example) is linked to a different sound.
* **D: Ku sungula laha voko ra wena ri khomaka vurha** (Starting where your voice breaks) describes the starting point for the down bow, not the sound itself.



"
Masalela ya marhambu ma komba leswaku mavoko ma cince leswaku ma tirhiselwa yini eka leswi landzelaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku tirhisiwa hi ndlela yin’wana** (To be used in another way).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Masalela ya marhambu ya mavoko lama nga ni malembe ya timiliyoni timbirhi ku fikela eka timiliyoni tinharhu ma komba ku cinca loko ka voko ku suka eku fambeni ku ya eku ma tirhiseni hi ndlela yin’wana"" which translates to ""Fossil hand bones dating back from two to four million years show changes as hands moved from walking to being used in another way.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ku rhwala ntiko** (To climb trees) - While chimpanzees use their hands for climbing, the passage focuses on the *change* from using hands for locomotion to other uses.
*   **C: Ku famba** (To walk) - The passage specifically states the hands *moved away* from being used for walking.
*   **D: Ku famba hi mahlangano ya mavoko** (To walk with knuckles) - This is a description of chimpanzee locomotion, not the evolutionary change the passage discusses.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma voko ni nenge ta chimpanzi? ,"The correct answer is **B: Mavoko ni nenge a swi fani hi vukulu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Voko ni nenge ra chimpanzi ra fana hi vukulu ni ku leha..."" (The ape and human hands are similar in size and shape...). This directly answers the question about what characterizes the similarity between ape and human hands.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Swi ololokeke ku hundza swa vanhu** (They are complex to use for humans) - The passage mentions human hands are *more* complex, not that they are difficult to use.
*   **C: Swi tirhisiwela ku rhwala ntiko** (They are used for climbing) - While mentioned as a function of ape hands, it doesn't specifically describe the *similarity* between them and human hands.
*   **D: Swi tirhisiwa hi ndlela yin’wana** (They are used in a different way) - The passage discusses how hand use *changed* over millions of years, implying a difference in use, but this doesn't define the initial similarity.



"
Ku hlawula ku susa ku hundzuka ka xiaki xa xitekela lexintshwa eka mpfangano wihi?,"The correct answer is **D: Lexi nga tirhisiwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ku hlawula ku swi susa eka mpfangano wa ku hamabana lowu nga tirhisiwa."" This directly translates to ""...paying to remove the change of a protocol on the meeting that is *used*.""

Therefore, the change in protocol being removed (or paid to be removed) applies to the meeting that is *used* (lexi nga tirhisiwa).



"
I ndlela yihi leyi tirhisiwaka ya ku engetela ku hambana ka xitekela?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku cinca ka xitekela** (Changing the method).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku hundzuka ka swiaki swa xitekela ku engetela ku hambana ka xitekela...""  This translates to ""Changing the method increases the difference in technique...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lexi nga hambanisiwa** (That which is compared) - While comparison is *part* of the process, it doesn't *increase* the difference.
* **B: Lexi nga hlanganisiwa kambe** (That which is combined, but) -  The passage suggests combining leads to a lessening of difference, not an increase.
* **D: Lexi nga tirhisiwa** (That which is used) - Using a method doesn't inherently increase the difference; it's the *changing* of the method that does.

"Hi ku ya hi rungula leri nga eka ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi faneleke swi dyiwa hi xihari lexi nga ni fambiselo ro gayela leri fanaka ni ra vanhu leswaku xi tlhantlha “xiphiqo xa tiphroteyini”?","The correct answer is **C: Majenje**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku hambana ni sweswo, swakudya swa swiharhi (vuswokoti, majenje ni matandza) a swi gayeki ntsena, kambe swi nyiketa tiphroteyini to tala leti nga ni tiamino asidi ta nkoka.""  This translates to: ""In contrast, plant-based foods (beans, oranges and vegetables) are not easily digestible, but they provide plenty of protein with essential amino acids.""

The passage then contrasts this with the difficulty animals have digesting plant matter, and highlights that plants *do* provide the necessary proteins. This directly answers the question of what a herbivore (an animal that eats plants) can eat to meet their protein needs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Matluka lama feke (Fake meats):** The passage specifically mentions that meat (from animals) is easily digestible but herbivores can't digest it well unless cooked.
*   **B: Tinyawa leti nga si swekiwa (Uncooked animals):** The passage says animals need to cook meat to digest it.
*   **D: Swihlovo swa swimilana (Animal products):** The passage focuses on what a *herbivore* would eat, not an animal that eats other animals.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiphiqo swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga vangiwiki hi ku nga kumi tiamino-asidi ta nkoka?","The correct answer is **A: Swiphiqo swa ku gayela**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that a lack of essential amino acids in animal protein can lead to the body being unable to *digest* (gayela) it properly, just like humans. The passage contrasts this with plant-based proteins which *are* digestible and provide essential amino acids.  The other options (sika, ku nga kuli ku ya emahlweni, rifu) are *consequences* of the digestive issue, not the initial problem caused by the lack of amino acids.

Swirho swa mintlawa ya ndhavuko leyi humaka eka ndhavuko lowukulu hakanyingi wu kombisa vuxirho bya vona njhani?,"The correct answer is **D: Hi ku tirhisa switayele tanihi mfungho.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Swirho swa ntlawa wa ndhavuko lowu nga huma eka ndhavuko lowukulu hakanyingi wu kombisa vuxirho bya vona hi ndlela leyi hambaneke ni leyi faniselaka ku tirhisiwa ka switayele, leswi katsaka tifexeni, mikhuva ni ririmi ra xitsotsi."" 

This directly translates to: ""The identity of a subculture originating from a larger culture often expresses its values in a different way than is conventionally accepted, including through fashion, housing, and slang.""  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hi ku ringeta ku tihlanganisa (By striving to unite)** - While unity might be *a* goal, the passage doesn't say this is *how* subcultures express themselves.
*   **B: Hi ku amukela leswi vanhu hinkwavo lava va nga na vona va swi pfumelaka (By accepting what everyone with it agrees with)** - This is the opposite of what a subculture does; they often challenge mainstream norms.
*   **C: Hi ku amukela mimpimanyeto ya tiko (By accepting national standards)** - Subcultures often *resist* national standards.

"Hi ku ya hi dyondzo leyi nga kombisiwa eka ndzimana, ku nga endleka yini hi n’wana loyi a nga eka ntlawa lowutsongo wa rixaka lowu ku nga ni mavonelo lama hoxeke a leswaku va nghenelela eka mahanyelo lama xungetaka?","The correct answer is **B: Swi nga endleka leswaku n’wana loyi ko tala a nghenelela eka mahanyelo lama xungetaka.**

Here's why:

The passage states that children from disadvantaged backgrounds (those with limited resources/support – ""mavonelo lama hoxeke hi rixaka"") often struggle academically. It implies a correlation between lacking resources and poorer performance.  Therefore, it's *likely* a child from such a background would be less likely to participate in challenging activities (""mahanyelo lama xungetaka"") due to potential feelings of inadequacy or lack of confidence stemming from their disadvantage.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: N’wana u ta ringeta ku papalata ku nghenelela eka mahanyelo lama xungetaka.** (The child will try to bravely participate in challenging activities) - The passage doesn’t suggest bravery; it suggests a struggle.
* **C: N’wana a nge swi lavi ku va eka swiyimo laha ku na vanhu kona.** (The child won't like being in situations where there are people) - The passage doesn’t mention social anxiety or aversion to groups.
* **D: N’wana u ta ala ku tihlanganisa ni mintlawa yin’wana leyitsongo ya rixaka.** (The child will want to associate with other children from the same background) - This isn't addressed in the passage.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, vutivi bya n’wana bya mavonelo lama hoxeke hi rixaka byi nga khumba yini eka leswi landzelaka?","The correct answer is **A: Ntlawa lowutsongo wa rixaka lowu va hlawulaka ku fanisiwa na wona.**

Here's why:

The passage directly states: ""Hi xikombiso, vana lava nga eka ntlawa lowutsongo wa rixaka lowu ku nga ni mavonelo lama hoxeke hi wona ya leswaku a va tirhi kahle exikolweni...""  This translates to ""For example, children in a difficult family situation where there are no positive role models... do not perform well at school.""  The passage links the *family situation* (ntlawa lowutsongo wa rixaka) to the child's performance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mahanyelo ya vona (Their feelings):** While feelings are important, the passage focuses on the *situation* and *role models* rather than just the child's emotions.
* **C: Vuxaka bya vona ni vana van’wana (Their relationships with other children):** The passage doesn't discuss relationships with peers.
* **D: Nhlamuselo ya vona ya rixaka (Their understanding of the situation):**  The passage focuses on the *existence* of positive role models, not the child's *understanding* of their situation.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga fambisaniki ni n’wana loyi a nga kula a pfaleriwa?","The correct answer is **D: Ku chava vanhu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...loko va kurisiwe hi ku helela hi swihari leswi nga riki vanhu, n’wana loyi a nga a pfaleriwa u va ni ku tikhoma (ku ya hi swipimanyeto swa miri) ku fana ngopfu-ngopfu ni leti ta xihari lexi nga n’wi khathalela, ku fana ni **ku chava kumbe ku honisa vanhu**."" 

This directly links the experience of being a neglected/abandoned child to behaviors like withdrawing from people (ku chava vanhu).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku hanya va ri voxe:** While the passage mentions some children are found alone, it doesn't directly connect this *as a result* of being a neglected child.
*   **B: Vuswikoti bya ku burisana:** The passage mentions a lack of understanding or emotional connection from parents, but not a specific inability to communicate.
*   **C: Ku lava ku va voxe:** The passage doesn't say these children *want* to be alone, rather they *end up* alone or withdrawn.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma ku lava ku va voxe ka vana?","The correct answer is **C: Ku lava ku va voxe ku vonakala eka vana lava nga kula va pfaleriwa hi vatswari va vona.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vana van’wana va vitaniwa “lava nga kula va pfaleriwa” kumbe va kula voxe. Vana van’wana lava nga kula va pfaleriwa va pfaleriwe hi vanhu (hi ntolovelo vatswari va vona)."" This directly links being ""voxe"" (alone/orphaned) to being raised by people, often their parents, after being abandoned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku lava ku va voxe ko tala ku vangiwa hi vugono bya miri** - While physical traits are mentioned as potentially mirroring those of the abandoning parent, it doesn’t *cause* the state of being “voxe.”
* **B: Ku lava ku va voxe ku suka eka ku nga hlanganisiwi na vanhu** - The passage says they *are* raised by people, even if abandoned.  It’s not a lack of human contact that defines being “voxe” in this context.
* **D: Ku lava ku va voxe ku vangiwa hi vogono lebyikulu bya vuswikoti bya ku twisisa** -  The passage suggests abandonment is due to parents’ inability to cope with a child's exceptional abilities, not the abilities themselves causing the “voxe” state.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i endlelo rihi eka lama landzelaka lama nga fambisaniki ni vurimi bya ku ti hanyisa i vurimi lebyi endleriwaka ku kuma swakudya leswi ringaneke?","The correct answer is **A: Ku dzika eka ntshovelo lowu fikelelaka swilaveko swa murimi ni ndyangu wa yena** (Focusing on a practice that meets the needs of the farmer and their family).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Vurimi bya ku ti hanyisa i endleriwaka ku kuma swakudya leswi ringaneke ku enerisa ntsena swilaveko swa murimi ni ndyangu wa yena."" (Subsistence farming is practiced to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku humesa swakudya leswaku u xavisela van’wana** (Producing food to sell to others) - This describes commercial farming, not subsistence farming.
* **C: Ku dzika eka ntshovelo lowukulu ku hambana ni tindlela leti hluvukeke** (Focusing on large-scale practices compared to developed methods) - The passage doesn't emphasize scale, but rather meeting basic needs.
* **D: Ku tirhisiwa ka mbewu ya ndhawu yoleyo** (Using local seeds) - While using local seeds *can* be part of subsistence farming, it isn't the *defining* characteristic mentioned as the primary goal.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that ""vurimi bya ku ti hanyisa i endlelo ro olova, hakanyingi ro kala tikhemikhali..."" which translates to ""farming in this way is a system of cultivation, often using chemicals..."". This directly links chemical use to this type of farming.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ri tirhisa tindlela tin’wana to olova ta ku humesa swo tala swinene** - While the passage mentions methods to increase yield, it doesn’t *define* the farming method itself.
*   **C: Ri pfumelela varimi ku avelana hi swibyariwa ni vanhu va ndhawu** - The passage doesn’t mention sharing of resources.
*   **D: Swa ha tirhisiwa hi varimi ematikweni man’wana** - The passage states it's common in many developing countries, not that it *isn't* used elsewhere.



"
Ku vhakela muziyamu i muxaka muni wa vupfhumba?,"The correct answer is **C: Vupfhumba bya ndhavuko**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Loko xikongomelo nkulu xa munhu loko a endzela ndhawu yo karhi ku ri ku tiva matimu ni ndhavuko vupfhumba lebyi byi tiviwa tanihi **vupfhumba bya ndhavuko**."" (When a person travels to a place specifically to learn about traditions and culture, this tourism is called **cultural tourism**.)

The question asks what kind of tourism a museum represents. Museums are places where you learn about history and culture, aligning perfectly with the definition of *vupfhumba bya ndhavuko* (cultural tourism) given in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vupfhumba bya bindzu** - (Adventure Tourism) - The passage doesn't focus on adventure.
*   **B: Vupfhumba bya ku tihungasa** - (Relaxation Tourism) - While relaxing might be *part* of a trip, the passage emphasizes learning and experiencing culture.
*   **D: Vupfhumba bya le handle** - (Foreign Tourism) - This isn't the focus; it's *why* people travel, not *what kind* of tourism it is.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi nga xikongomelo-nkulu eka vapfhumbi byo tihungasa?","The correct answer is **D: Ku twisisa matimu ya ndhawu** (To understand the customs of the place).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Loko xikongomelo nkulu xa munhu loko a endzela ndhawu yo karhi ku ri ku tiva matimu ni ndhavuko vupfhumba lebyi byi tiviwa tanihi vupfhumba bya ndhavuko.""  This directly translates to: ""The main goal of a person when visiting a place is to understand the customs and traditions, this is called traditional tourism.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku tipeta hi ndhavuko ya ndhawu yoloyo** (To experience the tradition of that place) - While related, the passage emphasizes *understanding* customs, not just experiencing them.
* **B: Ku wisa eka leswi va swi endlaka siku ni siku** (To escape what they do daily) - The passage mentions escaping daily life as a *reason* for travel, not the main goal of the tourist.
* **C: Ku vona miako leyi hlawulekeke ya tiko** (To see the beautiful places of the country) -  This is a possible benefit, but not the primary *goal* as stated in the passage.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Eka xiyimo lexi, ku tsundzuka swilo leswi hundzeke swa mikhuva ya va n’wamabindzu ni ku humelela loku landzelaka swi pfune vanhu va pfumela ku cinca ni ndlela leyintshwa ya kereke ya kwalaho."" This directly translates to: ""In this situation, understanding the experiences of the ancestors and learning from the past helps people accept change and a new way for the local church.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku kuma rungula ra vanhu lava kuceteleke ndhavuko wa nhlangano** (Getting insight from people who understand the history of the organization) - While helpful, the passage specifically highlights the importance of *ancestral* experience.
* **C: Ku kuma matimba lama fambisaka nhlangano** (Getting the forces that drive the organization) - This isn't mentioned as directly contributing to reducing resistance to change.
* **D: Ku twisisa matimu ya nhlangano** (Understanding the values of the organization) -  The passage states understanding values alone isn't enough; it needs to be connected to where one fits *within* those values.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ku twisisa matimu ya wena swi nga pfuna hi yini?","The correct answer is **C: Ku kuma laha munhu a nga wela eka nhlangano**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hambileswi ku twisisa matimu ya wena swi nga vuriki leswaku u ta twisisa ndhavuko, swa pfuna nyana leswaku munhu a vona leswaku yena u wela kwini eka matimu ya nhlangano.""  This directly translates to ""However, understanding your values is not enough to understand tradition, it helps a person to see where they fit within the values of the organization.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku hunguta ku chava ku cinca (Reducing fear of change):** While the passage *mentions* reducing fear of change, understanding your values doesn't *directly* cause that. It's a result of a broader process.
* **B: Ku tiyisa leswi hi swi rhandzaka (Confirming what we like):**  Understanding values is about more than just confirming preferences.

I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma minkarhi yo hundza eka dyondzo ya ximodeni?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku dyondza ku fanele ku dzika eka swilo leswi hi tshembaka leswaku hi ta hundza eka swona.**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that learning is successful when it's connected to the learner's experiences and interests (""Ku dyondza ku humelela exikarhi ka mudyondzi ni vutivi lebyi tisiweke""). It gives examples of learning through travel (Peru), home improvement (renovating a neighbor’s house), and relates learning to things people are already interested in. This directly supports the idea that learning is best when it's tied to things we care about and will remember.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tindlela tin’wana ta ku dyondza leti hi hundzaka eka tona ti vuyerisa ku tlula tin’wana:** While the passage suggests learning is individualized, it doesn't explicitly state some methods are *better* than others. It stresses personalization.
* **C: Tindlela tin’wana ta ku dyondza ti antswa ku tlula tin’wana:** The passage doesn't focus on the *difficulty* of learning methods, but their relevance.
* **D: A ku na ntiyiso eku dyondzeni:** The passage actually argues the opposite - learning *can* be successful when connected to personal experience.

I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga kombisiki hi ku kongoma minkarhi yo hundza eka ximodeni eka dyondzo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku dyondza ku titshege hi mudyondzi ni vutivi lebyi nga nyikeriwa.**

**Here's why:**

The passage explicitly states: ""Ku dyondza ku humelela exikarhi ka mudyondzi ni vutivi lebyi tisiweke."" This translates to ""Learning succeeds through the interaction of the learner and the environment provided.""  Option C directly reflects this idea.

**Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**

* **A: Ku ni tindlela to tala taku dyondza rungula** (There are many ways to learn correctly) - While the passage suggests there isn't *one* right way, it doesn't emphasize the *number* of ways.
* **B: Tindlela tin’wana ta ku dyondza leti hi hundzaka eka tona ti fanele ti rhangisiwa eka tin’wana** (Some learning methods that work for one should be adjusted for others) - The passage doesn't discuss adjusting methods; it focuses on the learner and environment.
* **D: Vutivi lebyi i nga ta tshuka hi byi tirhisa bya ha ri bya nkoka leswaku hi byi dyondza** (The environment that isn't used by us is unimportant for learning) - The passage suggests using the environment, but doesn't say unused environments are unimportant. It highlights the *interaction* with the environment, not just its presence.

"Endzhaku ka ku pfuka hi xikongomelo hi nkarhi wa wena lowu tolovelekeke wa ku etlela, i yini leswi nga ta nghenelela eka endlelo ra ku kavanyetiwa loko u etlela?","The correct answer is **C: Ku tima alamu ya xikomba-nkarhi leyi nga etlhelweni ra mubedo ivi u khomiwa hi vurhongo endzhaku ka timinete ta makume-mbirhi.**

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Loko u tikuma u tlhentlhisa xikomba-nkarhi evurhongweni, xi nga vekiwa etlhelweni rin’wana ra kamara, leswaku u boheka ku huma emubedweni leswaku u xi tima."" This directly describes turning off the alarm from outside the bed to ensure you wake up.  The passage also mentions a timeframe (10-60 minutes). 20 minutes falls within that range.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  While waking up refreshed is the *goal*, it's not a method for *interfering* with the sleep cycle as described in the passage.
* **B:** Using a sleep aid isn't mentioned as a way to interfere with the cycle.
* **D:** Drinking water before bed is a general habit, not specifically a method to make it harder to fall back asleep as described in the passage.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga riki nhlamuselo yo kongoma ya ku kavanyetiwa loku u etlele?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku nga sekeriwa eka endlelo ra ndzhendzheleko wa ntumbuluko**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a method for lucid dreaming.** It details techniques like setting an alarm for a specific sleep stage and using cues to recognize you're dreaming. The ""endlelo ra ndzhendzheleko wa ntumbuluko"" (method of inducing dreams/lucid dreaming) is the overarching context. The passage *is* an explanation of a method for inducing dreaming.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Xikongomelo i leswaku u nga pfuki hi ku helela (The purpose is not to wake up by falling asleep):** While the passage mentions not wanting to fully wake up, the *purpose* is to become aware you are dreaming, not just to avoid waking.
* **C: Endlelo leri ri endleka hi nkarhi wa wena lowu tolovelekeke wa ku etlela (This method works with your preferred sleeping time):** The passage suggests timing the alarm for a specific sleep stage, but doesn't emphasize personal preference for sleep time.
* **D: Endzhaku ka ku pfuka, xikongomelo i ku khomiwa hi vurhongo ku nga si hela tiawara timbirhi (After waking up, the purpose is to be reminded by your mind without fully waking up):** This is a misinterpretation. The aim is to recognize you're dreaming *while still dreaming,* not after partially waking up.

"Loko byongo byi ringeta ku endla milorho leyi u vonaka leswaku u yi lorha vusiku byin’wana ni byin’wana, i yini lexi engetelekaka?","The correct answer is **A: Nhlayo ya swiyimo swa REM**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hi ti REM to hlayanyana hi vusiku byin’wana ni byin’wna, xiyimo lexi u twaka vurhongo bya ntiyiso ni ku hlakarhela ka miri wa wena ku nga endleki ngopfu leswaku ku hundzuka xiphiqo.""  This directly links the *frequency* (nhlayo) of REM sleep to how much you feel rested and capable of performing tasks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mpimo wa matimba:** The passage doesn't mention anything about strength measurement.
* **C: Ku leha ka nkarhi wa xiyimo xa ku hlakarhela ka miri:** While the passage mentions feeling refreshed, it doesn't focus on the *duration* of that feeling, but rather *how often* it occurs through REM sleep.
* **D: Nkarhi exikarhi ka swiyimo swa REM:** The passage mentions the time *between* REM cycles, not the length of the cycles themselves, as being important for feeling rested.



"
I switandzhaku swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga humelelaka emirini hikwalaho ka ku endla milorho leyi u vonaka leswaku wa lora vusiku byin’wana ni byin’wana?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti REM leti nga hunguteka vusiku byin’wana ni byin’wana**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Hi ti REM to hlayanyana hi vusiku byin’wana ni byin’wna, xiyimo lexi u twaka vurhongo bya ntiyiso ni ku hlakarhela ka miri wa wena...""  This directly links the frequency of REM cycles each night to the feeling of being rested.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku hunguteka ka nkarhi exikarhi ka swiyimo swa REM:** While the passage mentions time *within* REM, it doesn't say the duration is the key factor in feeling rested.
* **C: Ku titshega hi ku va ni milorho leyi u nga ti endlela ku vona leswaku wa lorha:** This describes the *problem* (not being able to recall dreams) not the *solution* or reason for feeling rested.
* **D: Ti REM leti engetelekeke vusiku byin’wana ni byin’wana:** The passage talks about *hlayanyana* (varying/occurring) REM cycles, not necessarily *engetelekeke* (increasing) ones.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, mintlawa leyi tolovelekeke ni mintlawa ya le ka inthanete yi fana njhani?","The correct answer is **B: Mintlawa havumbirhi yi na mpimo lowu hambaneke wa ku kota ku ti ehleketela eka leswi yi swi endlaka siku ni siku.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Vanhu lava nga eka mintlawa ya le ka inthanete va tirha tanihi ndhawu yo hlangana. Va kota ku ti ehleketela ku tlula mintlawa leyi tolovelekeke hikuva mintlawa leyi yi nga hlangana hi kuya hi minkarhi yo hambana ya matiko leyi marhangeri va kwalaho va nga yi twisiseki.""  This directly translates to people in online teams can engage more easily than face-to-face teams *because* face-to-face teams are limited by different schedules and geographical locations. This highlights the difference in how easily they can participate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage says they *differ* in how they work, not that they work the same.
* **C:** While the ""invisible team"" concept is mentioned, the passage doesn't state that both types of teams are *guided* by it. It identifies it as a feature *of* online teams.
* **D:** The passage states the *opposite* – that face-to-face teams are limited by different time zones.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi leswi nga riki xa ntiyiso hi mintlawa leyi tolovelekeke ni mintlawa ya le ka inthanete?","The correct answer is **C: Mintlawa leyi tolovelekeke yi na vuswikoti bya ku ti ehleketela lebyi nga ehansi ku hambana ni mintlawa ya le ka inthanete.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Va kota ku ti ehleketela ku tlula mintlawa leyi tolovelekeke hikuva mintlawa leyi yi nga hlangana hi kuya hi minkarhi yo hambana ya matiko leyi marhangeri va kwalaho va nga yi twisiseki.""  This directly translates to ""They can engage with it more than traditional teams because traditional teams can only meet at different times of the day due to different time zones, making understanding difficult.""  Therefore, traditional teams have a *lower* capacity for engagement compared to online teams.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage states both types of teams are based on geographic locations, but it doesn't say traditional teams *are* geographic locations.
* **B:** The passage says online teams *act as* a meeting place, not that they are a meeting place *for* traditional teams.
* **D:** While the passage mentions different time zones as a *problem* for traditional teams, it doesn't say they *increase* online team activity.

I yini leswi ku nga dzikiwiki eka swona eka leswi landzelaka hi mavonelo ya vanhu vo tsala marungula?,"The correct answer is **A: Leswintshwa leswi va swi navelaka leswi nga endzeni ka vona loko va wupfa va kula** (Things they desire to achieve before they die/grow old).

Here's why:

The passage directly states that the beliefs of people who set goals are linked to ""what they hope to achieve before they die/grow old."" This is a core component of their motivations and drives.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ndlela leyi ndhawu ya vona yi khumbaka swiendlo swa vona** (The way their environment influences their behavior) - While environment *can* influence goals, it's not the primary focus of the description provided.
* **C: Swilaveko swa le ndzeni** (Inner needs) - This is too broad. The passage focuses on *specific* achievements and desires, not just general needs.
* **D: Ku twisisa leswi tsakisaka vanhu** (Understanding what motivates people) - This is the *study* of the beliefs, not the beliefs themselves. The passage *describes* the beliefs.

I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki xitirhisiwa xa nawu wa ku veka swiyenge swa nkoka ku sungula?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku endla xifaniso xi hanya ni ku tsakisa**.

Here's why:

The passage states the rule is about *avoiding* a situation where something is used in a way that is misleading or doesn't accurately reflect reality, leading to confusion in the composition.  Making the image ""simple and pleasing"" (ku endla xifaniso xi hanya ni ku tsakisa) directly addresses *avoiding* that misleading quality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku endla tilayini ta ndhawu laha xilo xi nga ta vekiwa kona** -  The passage mentions lines as *indicators* of a good placement, not the rule itself.
* **C: Ku veka xilo eka ndhawu yo karhi ni ya kahle ngopfu** - This describes *following* the rule (finding the sweet spot), not the rule itself.
* **D: Ku endla leswaku ku va ni ku tshamiseka eka xifaniso** - This describes the *result* of breaking the rule (confusion), not the rule itself.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Xiringaniso xa xiyenge xa muxaka lowu (ku avanyisa hi khume mbirhi ku kuma nhlayo yo olova ya xiringaniso) ku vuriwa leswaku i 3:2. Mixaka yo tala leyi tolovelekeke (mixaka ya ndyangu wa APS, hi xikombiso) yi ringana kumbe hi tshinele kwalomu ka xiringaniso lexi xa xiyenge.""  This means the 35mm format has a specific aspect ratio (3:2) that *differs* from many other common formats.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ya ha endliwa ni namuntlha:** While true, this isn't a defining *characteristic* of the 35mm format itself – it's about its current use.
* **B: Yi hundziseriwe eka mixaka ya khamera ya digitali:** This is a *result* of the 35mm format’s legacy, not a defining feature of the format itself.
* **D: I muxaka lowu tolovelekeke ngopfu emisaveni:** The passage doesn't state it's the *most* popular, just that it's a standard.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, loko vaendli va engetela swiyimo swa ku endla tilense, tilense ta ku tshineta ti antswisiwe njhani?","The correct answer is **D: Ti na ku rharhangana ka langutelo ku hambana na tilense ta ku leha ka langutelo leti simekiweke.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Xiphiqo xa tilense ta ku tshineta swilo i leswaku ku rharhangana ka langutelo ni nhlayo ya swiaki swa lense leswi lavekaka ku kuma ku leha ka langutelo i lokukulu ku tlula tilense ta ku leha ka langutelo leti simekiweke.""  This directly translates to ""A characteristic of aspheric lenses is that they have a different focal length relationship than standard lenses.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti na rivilo lerikulu ra tilense** - While the passage mentions a small radius of curvature (large curvature), this is *a result* of the design, not the defining characteristic explained in relation to the manufacturers improving lens making.
* **B: Swa olova ku ti tirhisa a tindhawini to kala rivoningo lerikulu** -  This is a benefit of the large radius, but not how they are *defined* or *modified* during manufacturing.
* **C: Xiyimo xa xifaniso xi fana ni tilensi ta ku leha ka langutelo loku nga simekiwa** - The passage states they *produce superior images* compared to standard lenses, not that they are the same.

"Hi ku ya hi rungula leri nga eka ndzimana, swi nga endleka rini laha lense ya ku tshineta yi nga laviwaka ku tlula lense ya ku leha ka langutelo leri simekiweke?","The correct answer is **C: Loko u nga lavi ku tirhisa rivoni ra miseve eka swiyimo laha ku nga munyama.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Leswi swi endla leswaku ku tika ku tirhisa tilense ta ku tshineta swilo leti nga durhiki a ti ndhawini to kala rivoningo lerikulu handle ka rivoni ra miseve.""  This translates to: ""This makes it possible to use aspheric lenses that are difficult to manufacture in areas where a large radius of curvature is required without a complex lens.""

Therefore, aspheric lenses are advantageous when you *don't* want to use a complex lens (and the associated difficulties) when dealing with large curvatures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Loko xikongomelo-nkulu ku ri mpimo lowukulu wa vukulu bya ximbhovana:** While a large radius of curvature *is* a characteristic, it's not the primary reason for *choosing* an aspheric lens. It's a situation where they become particularly useful.
* **B: Loko u lava nhlayo leyitsongo ya swiaki swa lense:** The passage mentions a complex arrangement of lens elements, but doesn't state this is the reason to choose aspheric lenses.
* **D: Loko u lava ku rharhangana ka langutelo loku engetelekeke:**  While aspheric lenses *can* achieve better resolution, the passage doesn't present this as the primary driver for their selection.

I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki nhlamuselo yo kongoma ya Dyondzo ya ku va swin’we ni Xikwembu?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku kandziyisiwa ku lava ntokoto wo kongoma ku fana ni tidyondzo tin’wana ta vukhongeri ni ku gandzela.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dyondzo ya ku va swin’we ni Xikwembu yi nga hambanisiwa ni mixaka yin’wana ya tidyondzo ta vukhongeri ni ku gandzela ni ku kandziyisa ka yona ntokoto wo kongoma...""  This directly translates to ""The practice of communion with God is distinguished from other religious and spiritual teachings by emphasizing personal experience...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While peace and a feeling of release are *results* described, they aren’t the defining *distinction* of the practice.
* **B:**  The passage states followers *seek* human experiences of spiritual fulfillment, but this isn't what *sets it apart* from other teachings.
* **C:**  The passage says practitioners accept methods to *increase* well-being, but again, this isn't the defining difference.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga riki eka Dyondzo ya ku va swin’we ni Xikwembu?","The correct answer is **B: Ku fikelela vutivi hi mintokoto leyi nga averiwa, ni leyi humelelaka eka van’wana.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Dyondzo ya ku va swin’we ni Xikwembu focuses on a *personal* experience – love, being touched, or the experiences of an individual relating to faith, spirituality, or God. It emphasizes a direct connection.

Option B describes achieving knowledge *through external means* (tools, things learned from others). This contrasts with the personal, internal focus of Dyondzo ya ku va swin’we ni Xikwembu.  The passage focuses on *experiencing* God, not *learning about* God through external resources.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku lava vutivi eka vutlharhi a ntiyisweni wa vukwembu** - The passage mentions seeking knowledge (vutivi) related to spirituality/faith.
* **C: Ku kandziyisa ka xiyimo xa ku titwa xo hlawuleka** - The passage explicitly mentions realizing a sense of worthiness.
* **D: Ku fikelela vuxiyaxiya bya Xikwembu** - The passage includes achieving understanding of God (vuxiyaxiya bya Xikwembu).



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i va mani lava swi nga endlekaka leswaku va sungule rixaka ro rima?","The correct answer is **A: Vamaori va le New Zealand**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...vanhu vo sungula ku tshama eNew Zealand a va ri Vamaori, lava va hloteke swinyenyana leswi vuriwaka moas."" This directly translates to ""The first people to settle in New Zealand were the Maori, who bred small birds called moas.""  It then goes on to describe them starting ""rixaka ro rima"" (agriculture).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Vamaori va le Swihlaleni swa Chatham:** The text says the Moriori settled the Chatham Islands, *not* the Maori.
*   **C: Vanhu va Maori lava humaka ePolynesia:** While the Maori *originated* from Polynesia, the text specifies it was the Maori *in New Zealand* who started agriculture.
*   **D: Vamaori lava a va huma ematikweni ya le ndzeni:** This refers to the Moriori's origins, and they didn't start agriculture first, the Maori did.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, vanhu lava hloteke swinyenyana leswi vuriwaka moas a ku ri vanhu vo sungula endhawini yihi?","The correct answer is **B: E New Zealand**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ku tshembiwa leswaku vanhu vo sungula ku tshama eNew Zealand a va ri Vamaori, lava va hloteke swinyenyana leswi vuriwaka moas."" This directly translates to ""it is believed that the first people to settle in New Zealand were the Maori, who were descended from the moa hunters."" 

Therefore, the moa hunters (the people descended from moas) were the first people in **New Zealand**.

Hi le ka swiyimo swihi laha ku tirhisiwa ka ndlela ya Pureland origami swi nga ta pfuna mupetsi?,"The correct answer is **C: Mupetsi u endla origami leyi lavaka kupetsa loku rharhangeneke ngopfu** (The artist makes origami that allows for complex folding).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Pureland origami was developed to allow for *complex* folding in a *single* process, something previously not allowed. It was specifically designed to help artists with limited dexterity.
* **Option C** directly reflects this: it describes an artist *creating* origami that *enables* complex folding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage says complex folding *is* possible, it doesn't say the artist *prefers* it.
* **B:** The passage says it *helps* those *with* limited dexterity, not that the artist *has* limited dexterity.
* **D:** The passage doesn't mention anything about how often the artist folds.



"
I yin eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamuseriki hi ku kongoma Pureland origami?,"The correct answer is **C: Kupetsa hinkwako kuna tindhawu to kongoma** (Folding completely to specific areas).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""kupetsa hinkwako kuna tindhawu to kongoma"" (folding completely to specific areas) is a characteristic of Pureland origami.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yi endleriwe vapetsi lava nga ni ntokoto** (It is done by skilled folders) - While skill is implied, the passage doesn't *define* it as a core characteristic.
* **B: Ndlela leyi a yi katsi kupetsa loku rharhangeneke ngopfu** (This method does not allow for complex folding) - The passage states complex folding is *not allowed*, making this a description *of* the method, not a defining characteristic.
* **D: I ndlela ya kahle eka vanhu lava nga ni vuswikoti bya misiha le byitsongo** (It is a good method for people with disabilities) - The passage mentions it was adapted for people with disabilities, but this isn't what *defines* Pureland origami itself.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i ndhawu yihi leyi nga fambisaniki ni Muganga wa Indus Valley?","The correct answer is **A: Le Harappa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...hambiloko van’wana va wu vitana Muganga wa le Harappan endzaku ka Harappa, ndhawu ya wona yo yimburiwa hi va-1920."" This directly links the Indus Valley Civilization (also referred to as the Harappan Civilization) to the site of Harappa.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nambu wa Sarasvati:** The passage mentions the Sarasvati river, but primarily in the context of a debate about naming the civilization, not as a directly associated location.
*   **C: Tindhawu hinkwato ta le n’walungu-vuxa Afghanistan:** While the civilization extended into that region, it's not *specifically* linked as a primary location like Harappa.
*   **D: Vunyingi bya Pakistan ya namuntlha:** This is part of the geographic area of the civilization, but Harappa is a specific site *within* that area.

The passage states: ""Hambiloko vadyondzi van’wana va anakanyela leswaku hikuva muganga a wu ri kona nakambe emadan’wini ya Nambu wa Sarasvati lowu nga oma sweswi, swi fanerile ku wu vitana Muganga wa Indus-Sarasvati...""  This directly states that some scholars suggest calling it the Indus-Sarasvati Civilization.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Muganga wa le Harappan:** While connected (named after Harappa), this is *a name for the civilization*, not a different name being proposed.
*   **C: Muganga wa Nambu wa Indus:** This is a descriptive location, not a civilization name.
*   **D: Muganga wa Indus Valley:** This *is* a name mentioned in the passage, but the question asks for a name *not* initially used but proposed later."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi tisaka swilo leswinene hi nkarhi wo leha?","The correct answer is **A: Ku tirhisana ni van’wana** (Working with others).

This directly translates to ""…if you have understanding, I believe many people will understand that the important things they need to do at that time are to **work well with people**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku rhangisa swilaveko swa munhu hi yexe ku sungula:** (Prioritizing personal needs first) - The passage doesn't mention prioritizing individual needs.
* **C: Ku kandziyisa leswi nga ta pfuna ntlawa lowutsongo ku tlula ntlawa lowukulu:** (Sacrificing a small gain for a larger one) - This concept isn't present in the text.
* **D: Ku lemuka leswaku makwanga ma nga vuyerisa:** (Remembering that countries don't help) - This contradicts the overall message of collaboration.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi munhu a nga ta swi rhangisa loko va dzike eka ku vuyeriwa hi ku hatlisa?","The correct answer is **A: Ku pfumala vutianakanyi** (Accepting guidance/counseling).

Here's why:

The passage (P) states that a lot of problems arise because people aren't guided properly (""loko vanhu vo tala va vuyeriwa ku ta tshama""). It emphasizes the importance of guidance (""vutianakanyi"") to help people make good decisions and cooperate effectively.  The question (Q) asks what someone should *consider* if they are being helped with difficulties. Accepting that guidance is the most logical answer.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ntirhisano** (Cooperation) - While important, the passage *suggests* cooperation will be *a result* of good guidance, not something to consider *when receiving* help.
* **C: Ku khomisana** (To comfort) - This isn't directly addressed in the passage.
* **D: Vutianakanyi** (Guidance) - The passage talks *about* the need for guidance, but the question is what a person should *do* when *receiving* it.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani loyi a nga hakelela xiphemo lexikulu xa swikoxo swa nyimpi?","The correct answer is **B: Tibangi ta le Wall Street**.

Here's why:

The text states the stolen funds were meant to be given to ""powerful forces on Wall Street"". This directly links them to benefiting from the hacked funds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mfumo wa Philippines (The Philippine government):** The text states the funds were *taken from* the US system, not that the Philippine government received the stolen amount.
*   **C: Mfumo wa koloni ya U.S. (The U.S. colonial system):** This is the system that was hacked, not the beneficiary.
*   **D: Vanhu va le Philippines (The people of the Philippines):** They are the ones who did the hacking, but not the intended recipients of the money.

The text states: ""...ku landzela Malembe ya le Xikarhi ya le ku Sunguleni a te emahlweni ka Malembe ya le Xikarhi ya le Henhla kambe ku landzela Malembe ya le Xikarhi ya Makumo, lama hi ntolovelo ma helaka kwalomu ka 1500."" This translates to: ""...following the Early Middle Ages was not before the High Middle Ages but following the Late Middle Ages, which historically ended around 1500.""  

This means the Late Middle Ages *followed* the time of the Templars (High Middle Ages) and ended around 1500.  Therefore, the Late Middle Ages came *after* the Templar period.

The text states: ""...Malembe ya le Xikarhi ya le u Sunguleni a te emahlweni ka Malembe ya le Xikarhi ya le Henhla kambe ku landzela Malembe ya le Xikarhi ya Makumo, lama hi ntolovelo ma helaka kwalomu ka 1500.""  This translates to: ""...The Early Middle Ages do not precede the High Middle Ages but are followed by the Late Middle Ages, which roughly end around 1500.""  Therefore, the Late Middle Ages came *after* the time of the Templars (High Middle Ages).

I vutshunguri kumbe maendlelo mahi lama nga si vuriwa tanihi lama nga tirhisiwa hi madokodela ni madokodela ya vuhandzuri hi nkarhi wa mfumo wa Roma?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku endla vutshila byo tsema swirho leswaku va ponisa vavabyi ka swilondza leswi pfundzelaka**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Va vi ni vutshila byo tsema swirho leswaku va ponisa vavabyi ka swilondza leswi pfundzelaka swin’we ni tinsoho ni swa ku rhunga misiha-nkulu leswaku ku hunguta ku khuluka ka ngati."" This directly describes the use of preparations to treat pain and wounds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't mention specifically diagnosing illnesses. It focuses on treatment.
*   **B:** While scopolamine *is* mentioned, it's part of a larger context of remedies, not the primary focus of what they *did* with anesthesia.
*   **C:** Reducing pain is a result of the treatments, but not the treatment itself.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi ku nga swi vuriwa leswaku swi vangele nhluvuko eka swa vutshunguri hi nkarhi wa Mfumo wa Roma?","The correct answer is **A: Ku vumbiwa ka Rhavi ra swa Vutshunguri** (The establishment of a Department of Medicine).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Madokodela ma sungule ku rhambiwa hi Mufumi Augustus kambe a endla Vuthu ra le Roma ra Vutshunguri ro sungula leswaku ri pfuna endzaku ka le swi nga humelela enyimpini."" This directly translates to ""Doctors began to be employed by Emperor Augustus, and he established the first Roman Department of Medicine so that it could deal with it before it caused problems in the army."" 

This shows the establishment of a dedicated department specifically to address issues related to medicine and, by extension, the problems caused by poisons - indicating a proactive response to the growing problem of poisoning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nawu wa vusocha wa nsindziso wa Mfumo** (The emperor's law of self-preservation):  The text doesn't mention any specific law focused on the emperor's protection.
* **C: Ku vumbiwa ka swibedlhele swa ku dyondza** (The establishment of learning facilities): While the passage talks about medical practices, it doesn't state learning facilities were *established* because of the poisoning issue.
* **D: Ku rhambiwa ka madokodela hi Mufumi** (Doctors being employed by the Emperor): This is a *result* of the problem, not the initial step taken to *prevent* poisoning-related issues. The employment of doctors was done *to* establish the department.



"
Ku kota ku vona ku titshege eka yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Swirho swa ku vona**.

Here's why:

The passage starts with ""Swivono, kumbe ku kota ku vona ku titshege **eka swirho swa ku vona**..."" (Eyes, or the ability to see is limited by the structures of seeing...).  This directly states what the ability to see is limited *by*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Leswi laviwaka hi xivumbiwa** (What is carried by the body) - This is mentioned *as a result* of how eyes are made, not what limits seeing itself.
* **C: Ku tikelwa hi tindlela leti hambaneke** (Being different in ways) - This describes *how* things are perceived, not the limitation of sight.
* **D: Ku nga voni hi ndlela leyi yi fanaka** (Not seeing in the same way) - This also describes *how* perception differs, not the fundamental limitation.



"
Tindlela leti hambaneke leti matihlo ma endliweke ha kona eka swivumbiwa swi titshege eka yini?,"The correct answer is **B: Swilaveko swa xivumbiwa** (Properties of the material).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...leti ti tikaka hi kuya hi leswi swi laviwa hi xivumbiwa"" which translates to ""...they are made according to what they are composed of by the material."" This directly links the different ways eyes are made to the *properties* of the material they are constructed from.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku tikeriwa (Creation/Making):** While eyes *are* created, the passage focuses on *how* they are created differently *based on the material*.
*   **C: Mpimo wa ku vona (Measurement of sight/vision):** This refers to how well something can see, not *how* it's made.
*   **D: Ku rharhangana ka xivumbiwa (Composition of the material):**  While related, ""swilaveko"" (properties) is a more encompassing answer. Composition is *what* something is made of, properties are *how* it behaves and how that influences its creation.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi mayelana ni Vusikh leswi nga kombisiki hi ku kongoma vukhongeri?","The correct answer is **C: Ku tlheli ku landzela hi ku tlhandlamana ti guru tin’wana ta kaye endzhaku ka musunguli wa vukhongeri, Guru Nanak.**

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Ku tlheli ku landzela hi ku tlhandlamana ti guru tin’wana ta kaye."" (It continued with following other gurus after the founder, Guru Nanak.) This directly addresses how the religion developed and continued *after* its initial founding.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate or incomplete:

* **A:** While the passage mentions Vusikh originating as a departure from Hinduism, it doesn’t fully *describe* the religion itself. It just points to its origins.
* **B:** The passage does say Guru is important, but it doesn't define *how* it's a defining characteristic of the religion, just its central role.
* **D:** The passage states Sikhs respect Hindu traditions and beliefs, but doesn’t make this a defining characteristic of the religion itself.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi tekiwaka tanihi xiphemu-nkulu xa vukhongeri bya Vusikh?","The correct answer is **A: Dyondzo ya guru**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Guru i xiphemu xa nkoka xa vukhongeri hinkwabyo bya le Indiya kambe eka Vusikh u teke ku va ka nkoka loku endlaka xisekelo va tidyondzo ta Masikh."" This directly translates to ""Guru is an important concept in Indian religions, but in Sikhism it takes on paramount importance as the foundation of Sikh teachings."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mindhavuko ya Vuhindu** - While the passage mentions Sikhism differing from and acknowledging Hindu traditions, it doesn't identify Hindu traditions *as* the central concept.
*   **C: Ku ala ku amukela vukhongeri byin’wan bya Indiya** - The passage indicates Sikhism is *distinct* from other religions, though it acknowledges some shared origins.
*   **D: Ku vulavula ririmi ra le Punjab** - While the language is relevant to the culture, the passage doesn't present it as a core tenet of the religion itself.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, vana lava nga ni Attention Deficit Disorder va tikeriwa ku dzikisa mianakanyo eka swilo swa ku fana ni?","The correct answer is **A: Ntirho wa xikolo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vana lava nga ni ADD va tikeriwa ku dzikisa mianakanyo eka swilo swa ku fana ni **ntirho wa xikolo**..."" (Children with ADD struggle to concentrate on things like **schoolwork**...).

While the passage *also* mentions they can focus on things they enjoy (like playing games or drawing), it specifically states they *struggle* with schoolwork.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ha yini vana lava nga ni Attention Deficit Disorder va katsekile eku tikhomeni hi ndlela leyi nga ni khombo?","The correct answer is **D: Leswaku va nyanyula byongo bya vona**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...va “ katsekile eku tikhomeni hi ndlela leyi nga ni khombo, va nghena etinyimpini naswona va lwisana ni vulawuri” leswaku va nyanyula byongo bya vona, hikuva byongo bya vona byi nge nyanyuleke hi tindlela leti tolovelekeke.""  This directly translates to them getting into trouble at school in a way that is problematic because they express their feelings, as their feelings aren't expressed in acceptable ways.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku hunguta ku va ni matimba ngopfu** (Reducing being very powerful) - The passage mentions being overly active as a symptom, but doesn't link it to trouble in schools specifically.
*   **B: Ku va pfuna ku endla vuxaka ni tintangha ta vona** (Being quick to cause chaos and problems) - While they *do* cause problems, the passage explains *why* - it's about expressing feelings.
*   **C: Ku kuma nyingiso eka vatswari va vona** (Getting attention from their parents) - The passage does not mention parents or seeking attention from them.



"
"Hi ku ya hi rungula leri nga eka ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki xikombiso xa ku dyondza ku ri karhi ku nyiketeriwa nseketelo?","The correct answer is **C: Progreme ya ku tiyimela ya ku dyondza** (Self-paced learning program).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly defines ""Ku Dyondza ku ri Karhi ku Nyiketeriwa Nseketelo"" (Learning with Guided Support) as learning *with* support, but where the support comes from tools like computer programs (like Microsoft Office) rather than a direct instructor.  It emphasizes the program guides you through challenges and helps you analyze problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dyondzo eku sunguleni ka ntlangu wa khompyuta (Computer language introductory learning):** While computer programs are *used* in this type of learning, it’s not the core *definition* of guided support learning.  The learning could be about anything, not just computer languages.
* **B: Mudyondzisi wa SAT (SAT tutor):** This is a *person* providing support, which the passage specifically contrasts with ""Ku Dyondza ku ri Karhi ku Nyiketeriwa Nseketelo"".
* **D: Muleteri wa nhlangano lowutsongo (Research organization employee):** This is irrelevant to the concept of learning with guided support.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamuseriki hi ku kongoma dyondzo ya ku dyondza ku ri karhi ku nyiketeriwa nseketelo?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku dyondza ku ri karhi ku nyiketeriwa nseketelo ku tirhisiwa ku nyika nseketelo eka ntokoto lowuntshwa wa ku dyondza.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ku dyondza ku ri karhi ku nyiketeriwa nseketelo a hi yona ndlela ya ku dyondza kambe i mpfuno lowu nyikaka nseketelo eka vanhu lava nga eka ntokoto lowuntshwa wa ku dyondza...""  This directly translates to ""Learning by being given feedback is not *the* way to learn, but it's a need that provides support to people who are at a new stage of learning...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage mentions it *can* be done by computer, that’s not the core defining characteristic.
* **B:** The passage says it's *not* necessarily better than other methods, just a helpful need.
* **C:** This describes a different aspect of learning mentioned in the passage, not the defining feature of learning *with* feedback.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swihlawulekisi swihi swa MySpace leswi nga ta pfuna swichudeni leswi tikeriwaka ku hlaya?","The correct answer is **A: Ku cinciwa ku endla swi olova**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ti nga cinciwa ku endla swi olova ku hlaya ni hi ku va ni muvala wo tala kumbe lowutsongo hilaha munhu a lavaka hakona."" This directly translates to ""It can be customized to make it attractive and have many colors or be dark where a person can find it.""  This describes the ability to customize the appearance, making it more appealing to students.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tibulogo** - While blogs are *part* of MySpace, the passage doesn't specifically link them to attracting students.
* **C: Adirese ya webusayiti yin’we** - This refers to the website address, not a feature that attracts students.
* **D: Tiphurofayili ta 54 wa timiliyoni** - This is a statistic about the number of profiles, not a feature.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki xiphemu xa nhlamulo ya Krushchev eka mpfilumpfulu wa vatirhi?","The correct answer is **A: Veka holobye-nkulu lontshwa** (Appointing a new head of state).

Here's why:

The passage states Krushchev *did* send troops, agree to some economic concessions, but specifically *allowed* Władysław Gomułka, who was popular with the workers, to become the new leader (holobye-nkulu). This was a key part of his response – a compromise that acknowledged some of the workers' desires.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: U rhumeli timovha ta nyimpi ku lulamisa xiyimo** (Sent troops to calm the situation) - While true, this wasn't the *only* thing he did, and the passage highlights a different aspect of his response.
* **C: Engetela ku hungutiwa ka miholo** (Increased wage cuts) - The passage states the workers were protesting *against* wage cuts, not that Krushchev increased them.
* **D: Pfumelelana ni swilaveko swin'wana swa ikhonomi** (Agreed to some economic demands) - Again, true, but not the most significant or defining part of his response described in the passage.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki xivangelo xa mpfilumpfulu a Poland?,"The correct answer is **A: Vukhomunisi**.

Here's why:

The passage states the protests were a reaction *against* communism (""ku hundzuka ku lwisana loku toloveleke ni Vukhomunisi""). While food shortages (B) and wage cuts (C) were *factors* contributing to the unrest, the underlying cause was dissatisfaction with the communist system itself.  D is incorrect as Gomulka was a result *of* the unrest, not a cause of it.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga khumbaka vuxaka exikarhi ka USSR na USA?","The correct answer is **C: Maendlelo lama hambaneke** (Different systems/ideologies).

Here's why:

The passage states the Cold War stemmed from differences in ""endlelo ni ndhavuko"" (systems and ideologies) between the USSR and USA. While the other options are touched upon (Germany - *Jarimani* - is a starting point, and differences in policies/approaches - *mafambiselo* - exist), the fundamental root cause described in the text is the contrasting ideologies.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamuseriki hi ku kongoma xikongomelo xa ku rhumela rungula hi tinevhe eka miri hinkwawo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku hlayisa homostasisi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Fambiselo ra Tinevhe ri hlayisa homostasisi hi ku rhumela rungula..."" (The function of Tinevhe is to establish homeostasis by sending signals...).  This directly links the signal transmission to maintaining homeostasis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku hunguta fambiselo ra ngati (Reducing nerve impulse):** The passage doesn't say the signal *reduces* nerve impulses, it *is* a nerve impulse itself.
* **B: Ku lawula fambiselo ra ngati (Controlling nerve impulse):** While the signal likely *influences* nerve impulses, the primary stated function isn't control, but establishing homeostasis.
* **D: Ku papalata ku chava kun’wana ni kun’wana (To adapt to change):** While homeostasis *allows* for adaptation, the passage focuses on the *establishment* of a stable state, not the adaptation itself.



"
I yini leswi nga kumiwaka eka Timbala-ntshava ta Giza?,"The correct answer is **A: Masirha**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Timbala-ntshava ta Giza, kumbe “Giza Necropolis” a Nkoveni wa la va Feke wa le Egipta ti na **swihondzo swo hlayanyana**, **masirha yo hlayanyana**, ti tempele to hlayanyana, ni Xivandzana lexikulu."" 

While the other options are *also* present at Giza, the text specifically lists ""masirha yo hlayanyana"" (small tombs) as being found there.



"
A ku ri yini xikongomelo xa Xihondzo Lexikulu?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku dzunisa Faro** (To honor the Pharaoh).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Xihondzo lexikulu xi endleriwe ku dzunisa Faro Khufu"" (The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu).  While it's *part* of a larger complex of tombs and memorials (making A somewhat related), the primary purpose of the Great Pyramid itself was to honor the Pharaoh.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku va xin’wana xa swihlamariso swa nkombo swa misava** (To be one of the tomb monuments of the ancients) - This is too broad. It *is* a tomb monument, but the text specifies a more precise purpose.
* **C: Ku tirha tanihi mfungho** (To work as a signal) - The text doesn't mention any signaling function.
* **D: Ku hlayisa masirha ya lava feke** (To store the tombs of the dead) -  While the complex *contains* tombs, the Pyramid itself was specifically for the Pharaoh.



"
I mani la nga ni vutihlamuleri hi vutivi bya hina bya mutshiveri wa ndzilo loyi a nga lovisa tempele?,"The correct answer is **A: Vanhu va le Efesa**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Vanhu va le Efesa, va hlundzukile, va tivise leswaku vito ra Herostratus ri nga rhekhodiwi."" (The people of Ephesus were angered and decreed that the name of Herostratus should not be recorded). This directly shows they were the ones who responded to the arsonist's act with an attempt to erase his memory.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Alekzanda Lonkulu** - Alekzanda was *present* when the temple was burned, but he didn't respond with an attempt to erase the arsonist's name. He wanted to rebuild.
*   **C: Strabo** - Strabo simply *recorded* the name later; he wasn’t reacting to the burning.
*   **D: Artemis** - Artemis is a goddess, not a person who would respond to the temple's destruction.



"
I swiga swihi leswi nga kongoma mayelana ni ku pfuxetiwa ka Tempele ya Artemis?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku pfuxetiwa ku hakeleriwe hi Alekzanda Lonkulu** (Rebuilding was initiated by Alexander the Great).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Endzhaku ka nkarhi, endzhaku ka loko a lovile, tempele yi pfuxetiwile hi 323 BCE."" (Later, after it was burned, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BCE). While Alexander didn't *personally* rebuild it, the text implies he initiated the rebuilding process after its destruction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku pfuxetiwe endzhaku ka ku fuma ka Alekzanda Lonkulu** (It was rebuilt due to Alexander the Great's wealth) - The text doesn't mention wealth as the reason for rebuilding.
* **C: Herostratus u lerisiwe ku hakelela ku pfuxetiwa** (Herostratus was tasked with rebuilding) - Herostratus destroyed the temple, he wasn't involved in rebuilding it.
* **D: Ku pfuxetiwe hi 320 BCE** (It was rebuilt in 320 BCE) - The text specifies 323 BCE, not 320 BCE.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, a ku ri rini ro sungula loko swivumbiwa swi famba hi milenge yimbirhi?","The correct answer is **A: Timiliyoni ta nkombo wa malembe lama hundzeke**.

The passage states: ""Sahelanthropus yi nga va yi fambe hi milenge yimbirhi kwalomu ka timiliyoni ta nkombo wa malembe lama hundzeke."" (Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs about 7 million years ago). This directly answers the question.



"
I swivumbiwa swihi eka leswi swa ku famba hi milenge yimbirhi nkarhi ni nkarhi?,"The correct answer is **D: Australopithecus**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vufambi byo tirhisa milenge yimbirhi byi kumeka eka vuyimburi bya Australopithecus ku suka hi 4.2-3.9 wa timiliyoni ta malembe lama hundzeke...""  This directly translates to ""Bipedal walking (walking on two legs) is found in the fossils of Australopithecus dating back to 4.2-3.9 million years ago...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sahelanthropus:** The passage says Sahelanthropus *might* have walked on two legs, but isn't definitive (""yi nga va yi fambe hi milenge yimbirhi"").
*   **B: Homo Erectus:**  The passage says Homo Erectus were already walking upright (fambaka va ololokile) - it doesn't state they *started* walking on two legs.
*   **C: Vufambi byo tirhisa milenge yimbirhi (Bipedal walking):** This is the *type* of movement, not a creature.



"
Masocha ya le Jarimani ya le matini a ma ringeta ku fikelela yini hi Nyimpi ya Vumbirhi ya Msava?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku sivela Britain ku amukela vanhu ni nhundzu** (To prevent Britain from receiving people and supplies).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...masocha ya le Jarimani ya le matini, hi ku tirhisa byatso byale matini, a va ringeta ku sivela nkwetlembetano."" This translates to ""...German naval forces, using submarines, were able to interrupt the convoys.""  Interrupting convoys means preventing goods and people from reaching their destination – in this case, Britain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku yimisa nhundzu lowu humaka e Britain** (To stop supplies from Britain) - While they aimed to disrupt Britain, the primary goal wasn't stopping supplies *from* Britain, but *to* Britain.
*   **C: Ku tleketla nhundzu ku hundza Atlantiki** (To escort supplies across the Atlantic) - This is the opposite of what the German navy was doing.
*   **D: Ku sivela Amerika ku amukela vanhu ni nhundzu** (To prevent America from receiving people and supplies) - The passage specifically mentions the German navy's attempt to counter American efforts to *help* Britain, not to prevent America from receiving things.



"
"Hi ku ya hi rungula leri nga nyikeriwa eka ndzimana, i mani loyi a nga humelela ngopfu eka nyimpi ya vuthu ra le matini hi nkarhi wa Tsima ra Atlantiki N’walungu?","The correct answer is **A: Va le Britain ni Maamerika**.

Here's why:

The passage states that America was able to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain. This implies both Britain (receiving aid) and America (providing aid) benefited and were successful in the Battle of the Atlantic.  It also states Germany *tried* to prevent this, but ultimately failed to defeat Britain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Majarimani** - The passage says Germany *tried* to win, but ultimately failed.
* **C: Majarimani ni va le Britain** - While both were involved, the passage highlights the success of Britain *and* America in the effort.
* **D: Va le Britain** - America’s contribution was vital and explicitly mentioned as a success.



"
I yini leswi nga swi va kona loko Vaasiriya va sungula ku tirhisa vagadi va tihanci?,"The correct answer is **A: Switshamo leswi tlhandlekiwaka ehancini** (Iron weapons).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Switshamo leswi tlhandlekiwaka ehancini a swi nga si tirhisiwa, hikwalaho vagadi va tihanci va va Asiriya a va lwa va tshame ehenhla ka nhlana wa hanci u nga ri na nchumu."" This translates to: ""Iron weapons were not being used, therefore Assyrian chariot fighters fought while standing on a chariot without a weapon.""  This implies the *availability* of iron weapons is what enabled the Assyrians to utilize chariot fighters effectively.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mavurha** (Rivers) - Rivers are mentioned as a way to access enemy camps, but not as something that *enabled* the use of chariot fighters.
*   **C: Makalichi** (Forts/Castles) - Forts were being *attacked* by the chariot fighters, not what allowed them to operate.
*   **D: Mahavelo** (Spears) - Spears are mentioned as lacking on the chariots, indicating a *lack* of them, not an enabling factor.



"
Tinyimpi leti tirhisaka vagadi va tihanci ti lwiwa njhani?,"The correct answer is **C: Va tshame ehenhla ka nhlana wa hanci**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...vagadi va tihanci va va Asiriya a va lwa va tshame ehenhla ka nhlana wa hanci u nga ri na nchumu."" ( ""...Assyrian chariot fighters would fight while standing on the chariot without a weapon."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hi milenge** - The passage doesn't mention using ropes.
*   **B: Handle ka mahavelo** - While the passage mentions mahavelo (fortifications), it doesn't say the battles *were fought* with them. They were what the Assyrians attacked.
*   **D: Hi masocha lamatsongo** - The passage mentions leaving soldiers and chariots behind, but doesn't state they fought *with* heavily armored soldiers.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, hi le kwihi laha u nge kumiki muaka-tiko la tolovelekeke wa Babilona?","The correct answer is **C: Eka nkhuvo lowu nga eka xivava xa tempele lexi pfulekeke**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tempele ha yin’we a yi ri ni xivava xa tempele lexi pfulekeke ni xikwetsimisiso xa le ndzeni laha a ku nghena vaprista ntsena."" This directly translates to ""Each temple had a sacred entrance and a foundation where priests entered.""  This is where the most revered part of the Babylonian temple would be located – the entrance to the sacred space.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku tisa magandzelo eka xivava xa tempele** - While offerings were made *to* the gods, the passage doesn't say this is where the most sacred part is.
*   **B: Ku ya eka mihivahivani eka tempele leyikulu** - The passage mentions rituals, but doesn’t specify these are the most important locations.
*   **D: Ku tisa magandzelo eka xikwetsimisi xa le ndzeni** - Similar to A, offerings were made, but it doesn't identify this as the most sacred area.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi a ku ri swa vaprista ntsena?,"The correct answer is **B: Swikwetsimisiso swa le ndzeni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tempele ha yin’we a yi ri ni xivava xa tempele lexi pfulekeke ni xikwetsimisiso xa le ndzeni laha a ku nghena vaprista ntsena."" This directly translates to ""Sometimes a temple had a sacred chamber and a sanctuary inside where priests entered.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Minkhuvo (Offerings)** - The passage mentions offerings being made *to* the gods, but doesn't say they were exclusive to the priests.
*   **C: Mihivahivani (Rituals)** - Priests performed rituals, but the sanctuary itself isn't a ritual.
*   **D: Ziggurats** - Ziggurats were the structures *around* the temples, not where the priests specifically went.



"
Xana Hosi Tutankhamun u ve ni ndhuma rini?,"The correct answer is **C: Endzhaku ka ku kumiwa ka sirha ra yena**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hambiloko ku kumiwa ka sirha ra yena hi 1992 ku n’wi endle munhu loyi a dumeke."" This directly translates to ""However, the discovery of his tomb in 1992 made him a famous person.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Endzhaku ka ku tekiwa ka swilo esirheni ra yena** - While treasures *were* found in his tomb, the passage says the fame came *after* the tomb was discovered, not just from taking things out of it.
*   **B: Hi nkarhi wa yena wa ku fuma** - The passage doesn't mention his fame during his lifetime, only that he wasn't considered very important historically *until* after the tomb discovery.
*   **D: Endzhaku ka ku vuriwa eka minxaxamelo yo tala ya khale ya tihosi** - The passage actually says he wasn't recorded in many ancient records of pharaohs – so this is the opposite of why he became famous.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hambiloko va teke swilo emasirheni yo tala ya khale, sirha leri ri tshikiwi ri nga kavanyetiwanga."" (However, when they excavated ancient tombs, his tomb was found intact.) and ""...ku n’wi endle munhu loyi a dumeke."" (...made him a famous person).

This directly links the *intact* discovery of his tomb to his fame.  The other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage says he *wasn't* well recorded in ancient royal lists.
* **C:** While the treasures are significant, the *discovery* of the tomb is what initially brought him fame.
* **D:** The passage states he wasn't considered very important in ancient times.



"
I yini leswi mutlhokovetseri Homer wa Mugriki a tsandzeka ku swi endla?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku vona (To see)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Homer was a ""mutlhokovetseri loyi a feke mahlo loyi a tiviwaka ngopfu"" - a poet who *feigned eyes* and was very famous. ""Feka mahlo"" literally means ""to fake eyes"" but in this context, it implies he was a skilled storyteller who could vividly *describe* things as if he had seen them himself.  Therefore, the key skill Homer excelled at was being able to powerfully portray scenes and events, essentially ""seeing"" with his imagination and conveying that to others.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku twa (To hear):** While poets listen to stories, the passage focuses on Homer's ability to *show* through his writing.
*   **C: Ku famba (To walk):**  There's no mention of travel or physical movement in relation to Homer.
*   **D: Ku vulavula (To speak):** While he *wrote* poetry, the emphasis is on his imaginative vision, not simply his ability to talk.



"
Hi wihi Mugriki loyi a nga ni ndhuma ya swin'wana handle ka vutsari?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagorus**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mugriki un’wana loyi a dumeke i mutivi wa tinhlayo Pythagoras, loyi a tiviwaka ngopfu hi nhlamuselo ya yena leyi dumeke ya kutirhisana ka matlhelo ya swivunguvungu swa tinhla tinharhu ta engele ya 90 wa tidigri."" This clearly identifies Pythagoras as a mathematician (mutivi wa tinhlayo) and describes his famous theorem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sophocles:** The passage identifies Sophocles as a playwright (vatsari va mintlangu).
* **B: Homer:** The passage identifies Homer as a poet, known for the *Iliad* and *Odyssey*.
* **D: Aristophanes:** The passage identifies Aristophanes as a playwright (vatsari va mintlangu).



"
Ndyangu wa Vaheveru a wu tirhisa nkarhi wa wona hi xitalo kwihi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ehandle**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Vutomi bya ndyangu wa Vaheveru hi xitalo a wu ri **ehandle**."" This directly translates to ""The life of the Hebrew people in exile was **outside**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Exitarateni** - The text mentions *exitarateni* (in the camps) regarding where women didn't cook, but not where the people lived their exiled life.
* **C: Ejarateni** - Similar to B, this relates to cooking, not general living.
* **D: Endlwini** - The text specifically says their houses were not important, implying they weren't *in* houses.



"
I yini leswi a swi nga ri swa nkoka eka ndyangu wa Vaheveru?,"The correct answer is **C: Kaya ra vona** (Their home).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vutomi bya ndyangu wa Vaheveru hi xitalo a wu ri ehandle."" which translates to ""The life of the Hebrew people in Egypt was not in their own home/land."" This directly indicates that having their own home/land was important to them and something they lacked.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Maxelo ya vona** (Their stories) - The passage mentions maxelo (stories) but doesn't say they were *important* to the Hebrews' well-being.
* **B: Switolo swa vona** (Their wealth) - The passage states they lacked significant wealth (""A ku nga ri ni makhwati lamakulu"").
* **D: Ndlela ya vona ya ku sweka** (Their way of cooking) - The passage mentions women not cooking in the kitchens, but doesn't frame cooking as a central importance to their lives.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamuseriwangiki tanihi ku hambana exikarhi ka matiko ya Scandinavia?,"The correct answer is **A: Matimu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...tiko rin’wana ni rin’wana a ku ri ra ‘Scandinavia’, a ku ri ni swilo swo tala leswi hambaneke exikarhi ka vanhu, tihosi, mikhuva **ni matimu** ya le Denmark, Sweden, Norway ni Iceland."" 

This translates to: ""...each country is considered 'Scandinavia', there are many differences between the people, rulers, cities **and cultures** of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.""

Therefore, cultures (matimu) are identified as one of the key differences between the Scandinavian countries.



"
I va mani lava nga tshama a Greenland ku sungula?,"The correct answer is **A: Tinyimba ta Maeskimo** (The Inuit/Eskimo people).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kambe ku nga khathariseki ntshubulo wa yena, tinyimba ta Maeskimo ana a se ti tshama kwalaho.""  This translates to: ""But before his arrival, the Inuit people were already living there.""

While Erik the Red later explored and named Greenland, the passage clearly indicates the Inuit were the original inhabitants.



"
I ntlawa wihi lowu a wu rhandza ku dya swakudya swa vona wu nga tshamanga eswitulwini?,"The correct answer is **C: Vavanuna va van’wankumi va Marhoma** (Men of the Roma people).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...van’wankumi a va rhandza ku va na minkhuvo va ri swin’we laha a va tshama hi matlhelo va ri karhi va dya swakudya swa vona.""  This translates to ""...men do not like to have relatives with them where they live permanently while eating their food."" 

Therefore, it's the men of the Roma people who are described as wanting to eat their food privately, away from relatives.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga ta tshuka swi va xiphemu xa swakudya swa khale swa Varhoma?,"The correct answer is **D: Ndyelo ya galaguni leyi oxiweke** (Lack of a garden/farming).

Here's why:

The passage states ""naswona a nga kona Murhoma loyi a nga nantswa galakuni"" which translates to ""and there was no Roma who had a garden."" This directly indicates a limitation in their food sources – they didn't grow their own produce.  This is what would differentiate their *ancient* diet from later diets which *did* include foods like tomatoes, potatoes, etc. brought from other continents.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vaendzi va xisiwana va dya va tshame eswitulwini** (Visitors to the settlement ate while living in the wilderness) - This describes a *behavior* around eating, not the food itself.
* **B: Swakudya leswi ku sunguriwaka hi swona swa swihumbana** (Food started with snails) - Snails are *an example* of what they ate, not a defining characteristic of their ancient diet.
* **C: Vavanuna va van’wankumi va tshama hi matlhelo va ri karhi va dya swakudya swa vona** (Noblemen lived on farms while eating their food) - This is about *where* some people ate, and doesn’t define their overall ancient diet.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi ku nge endlekiki leswaku swi va ni nkucetelo lowu nga heriki?","The correct answer is **B: Ndhavuko lowutsongo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mindhavuko leyitsongo hakanyingi ya nyamalala yi nga siyi vumbhoni va matimu lebyi faneleke naswona yi tsandzeka ku xiyeka tanihi ku tshama swi’nwe loku kahle.""  This directly translates to ""Fragmented cultures often disappear without leaving traces of valuable traditions and struggle to establish good communal living."" This implies they *lack* a lasting, positive outcome or a strong foundation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vaaka-tiko (Citizens):** The passage describes citizens as being part of a larger, thriving communal life.
*   **C: Tiko-doroba (City-states):** These are presented as examples of states and are part of the positive development of communal living.
*   **D: Ndhavuko wa ku tshama swin’we (Culture of communal living):** This is the overall concept being discussed and is presented as something desirable and beneficial.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi rhangeleke tiko?","The correct answer is **C: Tiko-doroba**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""**civitas, leyi vulaka doroba kumbe tiko-doroba, naswona leyi hi ndlela yin’wana yi hlamuselaka vukulu bya vaaka-tiko. Matiko-doroba i swikombiso swa matiko.**"" 

This translates to: ""**civitas, which means a city or city-state, and which in another way defines the size of citizens. City-states are examples of countries.**"" 

Therefore, a tiko-doroba (city-state) is presented as something that *represents* a country.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndhavuko wa ku tshama swin’we (Culture of living together):** While important to the passage, it *defines* what makes a good society, it doesn't *represent* a country itself.
*   **B: Ndhavuko wun’we (One culture):**  Too broad - the passage discusses a culture of cooperation, not simply one single culture.
*   **D: Mindhavuko leyitsongo (Bad cultures):** The passage discusses how negative cultures can *hinder* good governance, but they don't *represent* a country."
I swiga swihi leswi nga riki ntiyiso hi Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **A: Ri endliwe ku tsundzuka loko ku hluriwa mavuthu ya Tibetan-Mongol** (It was built to commemorate the victory over Tibetan-Mongol invaders).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ku vuriwa leswaku hi 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel u endle khokholo leri ku tsundzuka loko a hlula mavuthu ya Tibetan-Mongol."" (It is said that in 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the fortress to commemorate his victory over Tibetan-Mongol invaders.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ri le la ndhawu ya Bhutan** (It is located in Bhutan) - While true, the passage doesn't *specifically* highlight this as a key fact *about* the dzong itself.
* **C: Ndzilo wu lovise swo tala swa swilo leswi saleke** (Fire destroyed many of the relics) - The passage says *some* relics remained, not that many were destroyed.
* **D: Ri endliwe hi Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel** (It was built by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel) -  True, but the primary reason *for* its construction, as stated in the text, is the commemoration of the victory.



"
I swiga swihi leswi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma mbuyelo wa ndzilo e Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **A: Xilo lexi saleke ntsena a ku ri xifaniso xa Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hi 1951, ndzilo wu vange leswaku swin’wana swa swilo leswi saleke swa Drukgyal Dzong swi tshama swi ri kona, ku fana ni xifaniso xa Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal."" This directly links the discovery of relics, specifically the portrait of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, to the restoration of the temple.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mavuthu ya Tibetan-Mongol ma hlurile:** The text says Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel *defeated* these forces, not that they won.
* **C: Ku rhandziwa ka xona a ku khumbekanga:** While the temple is beloved, the passage doesn't say its popularity led to restoration.
* **D: Ri hlayisiwe hi Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel:** He built the temple originally, but the *restoration* was triggered by the finding of the relics.



"
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki ntiyiso hi Cambodia?,"The correct answer is **D: Vanhu va le Thailand va lovise Phnom Phen**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Vanbu va le Thaiwan va hlaseli Cambodia kotalanyana hi lembe xidzana ra vu-18 kambe hi 1772 va lovisi Phnom Phen.""  This directly translates to ""People from Thailand attacked Cambodia throughout the 18th century, and in 1772 they captured Phnom Phen.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vanhu va le Vietnam va lovise Phnom Phen** - The text says Vietnam *attacked* Cambodia later in the 18th century, but doesn't say they *captured* Phnom Phen.
*   **B: Vanhu va le Cambodia va hlaseli Thailand hi 1772** - The text says Thailand attacked Cambodia, not the other way around.
*   **C: Cambodia yi hlaseriwe hi vanhu va le Vietnam emasungulweni ya lembe-xidzana ra vu-18** - While Vietnam did attack, it was later in the century, not at the *beginning*.



"
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma ku hlaseriwa ka Cambodia?,"The correct answer is **A: Vanhu va le Vietnam va hlaseli Cambodia minkarhi yo tala**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Emalembeni yo hetelela ya lembe-xidzana ra vu-18 vanhu va le Vietnam va hlasele Cambodia kambe."" (In the latter half of the 18th century, people from Vietnam attacked Cambodia repeatedly.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While Thailand *and* Vietnam attacked, the passage emphasizes repeated attacks from Vietnam specifically in the latter half of the century.
* **C:** The passage says the Thai attacked and *captured* Phnom Phen in 1772, not the Vietnamese.
* **D:** The passage doesn't say Thailand attacked repeatedly, just that they attacked and captured the city.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi khampani ya Dutch East India yi nga swi endlanga hi nkarhi wa vona le Taiwan?,"The correct answer is **C: Yi qacha vatirhi va Machayina leswaku va tirha emasimini**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hi 1624, Khampani ya Dutch East India yi ake govela edzonga-vupela-dyambu bya Taiwan, yi sungula ku hundzula mikhuva ya ntshovelo wa mavele ya vaaki vo rhanga kambe yi qacha vatirhi va Machayina leswaku va tirha emasimini ya rhayisi na chukele."" This directly explains what the Dutch East India Company *did* while in Taiwan – they employed Chinese workers on rice and sugarcane fields.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** ""Yi ake govela edzonga-vupela-dyambu bya Taiwan"" is *where* they arrived, not what they did.
*   **B:** ""Yi endle mikhuva ya ntshovelo wa mavele ya vaaki vo rhanga"" is something they did, but the text indicates they were already there, and the Dutch were building them.
*   **D:** ""Ku nyiketela mfumo wa Taiwan eka ntlhandlamano wa tihosi wa Qing"" happened much later with the Qing dynasty, not during the Dutch period.



"
Ntwanano wa le Shimonoseki wu simeke yini?,"The correct answer is **D: Vulawuri bya Japani eka Taiwan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hi 1895, endzhaku ka ku hluriwa Enyimpini Yo sungula ya Machayina na Majapani (1894-1895) hulumende wa Qing u sayine Ntwanano wa le Shimonoseki, hi ku endla tano wu nyiketela mfumo wa Taiwan eka Japani..."" 

This directly means the Shimonoseki Treaty resulted in Japan gaining control of Taiwan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the treaty *followed* a Japanese victory, the treaty itself *is not* the victory.
*   **B:** This describes a situation *before* the treaty.
*   **C:** This is a general statement about Taiwan’s history, not specifically what the treaty did.



"
Mpimo wa pH ya khemikhali wu pimanetiwa njhani?,"The correct answer is **C: Nhlayo ya tiayoni ta hayidirojeni eka khemikhali** (The concentration of hydrogen ions in a chemical).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Mpimo wa pH wu titshege hi mpimo wa ti ayoni ta hayidirojeni (H eka pH) eka khemikhali leyi pimiwaka.""  This translates to ""The pH measurement is determined by the measurement of hydrogen ions (H or pH) in the chemical being measured.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mpimo wa khemikhali i asidi kumbe beyizi** (Whether a chemical is acidic or alkaline) -  This *describes* what pH tells you, but it's not *how* it's measured.
* **B: Ku ni tiphorothoni ti ngani eka khemikhali** (How many protons are in a chemical) - While protons (hydrogen ions) are involved, pH measures their *concentration*, not just the total number.
* **D: Ku ni tielekitironi ti ngani eka khemikhali** (How many electrons are in a chemical) -  Electrons are important in the formation of ions, but pH is specifically about hydrogen ion concentration.



"
I yini leswi nga susiwa eka tiayoni ta hayidirojeni?,"The correct answer is **A: Tiphorotoni** (Protons).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Ti ayoni ta hayidirojeni i ti phurothoni leti ti tekeriweke ti elekitironi ta tona..."" which translates to ""Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost electrons.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pH** - pH is a *measure* of hydrogen ions, not what they are made of.
* **C: Alkalayini** - Alkalinity (being a base) is a property related to pH, but not a component of hydrogen ions.
* **D: Tielekitironi** - The text says hydrogen ions *lose* electrons, they aren't made *of* electrons (though they do have a relationship with them).



"
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamuseriki hi ku kongoma ntlhambi wa tinghala?,"The correct answer is **A: Wu tikhoma ku fana na timbyana**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mintlhambi ya tinghala yi ti khoma ni ku fana na timbyana ta khwati kumbe timbyana..."" which translates to ""The family of fish resembles small fish or sardines...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nhlayo ya ta xinuna ni ta vavasati a yi ringani** - The passage states the opposite; it says there are many females (""letitsongo"") compared to the single male (""nghala yin’we ya xinuna"").
* **C: Ta xinuna ni ta vavasati i maxaka** - While it mentions females are numerous, it doesn’t say males and females are few in number.
* **D: Havumbirhi ta dlaya naswona ti rhandza ku tshama swin’we** - This is true, but it's a general statement about the fish and not a *specific detail* about how the family structure is described.  The question asks about a detail *describing* the family, and the resemblance to small fish is the direct description.



"
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamuseriki hi ku kongoma ku tikhoma ka tinghala?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku tikhoma ka tona ku fana ni timbyana ta khwati**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mintlhambi ya tinghala yi ti khoma ni ku fana na timbyana ta khwati kumbe timbyana..."" This directly translates to ""The group of swallows nests and looks like swallows' nests or nests.""  The question asks about what is described regarding how swallows nest.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti na rhandza ku tshama swin’we** - While true, this is about their *behavior* (liking to nest together) not their *nesting style* (how they build their nests).
* **C: Havumbirhi ta xinuna ni ta vavasati ti dlaya ngopfu eka leswi swi ti dlayaka** - This refers to the composition of the group, not the nest itself.
* **D: Ku tikhoma ka tona ku fana ni swimanga swin’wana leswikulu** - The passage specifically states the nests *don't* resemble other large swallow nests.



"
Hi wihi muxaka wa swiharhi leswi ku tolovelekeke leswaku swidya mimpfundla?,"The correct answer is **C: Swimanga leswi nga riki swikulu kumbe switsongo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ehansi ka tona ku na swimanga leswi nga riki swikulu kumbe switsongo leswi dyaka swihari swo fana na mipfundla..."" (Under the soil there are small or medium-sized plants that produce fruits similar to mushrooms...). This directly links the plants that produce mushroom-like fruits to being neither large nor very small.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Swimanga leswitsongo** - The passage mentions these *as being produced by* the plants, not *being* the plants themselves.
*   **B: Swimanga leswikulu** - The passage specifically states these plants are *not* large.
*   **D: Timhala** - The passage mentions timhala as a destination for the fruits, not as the plants themselves.



"
Swimanga leswitsongo swi hlota yini eka leswi landzelaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Makondlo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ku na swimanga swo tala leswitsongo...leswi dyaka swilo swo tala leswitsongo leswi fanaka na **switsotswana, makondlo**, nkolobywani na swinyenyani.""

This directly links *makondlo* to being a type of *swimanga leswitsongo* (small, thorny plants). The other options (mimpfundla, timhala, mhuti) are mentioned as things the larger plants grow *towards*, not as examples of the small, thorny plants themselves.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki xiphemu xa ndlela ya ku hlota ya ocelot?,"The correct answer is **B: Yi landzelela ku nhun’whela ka swihari leswi yi swi dyaka** (It follows the tracks of the animals it hunts).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Va n’wasayense va ehleketa leswaku ti-ocelot ti landzela kumbe ti kuma swihari leswi ti swi dyaka hi ku nhun’wheta ndhawu leyi a swi famba eka yona."" This translates to ""Scientists believe that ocelots follow or find animals they hunt by tracking the areas they move through.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yi ti fanisa na ndhawu ya yona** (It camouflages itself with its surroundings) - While the passage mentions camouflage, it's described as *how* it hunts, not the *method* of finding prey.
*   **C: Yi landzelela swihari leswi yi swi dyaka nivusiku** (It follows the animals it hunts at night) - The passage says it hunts well at night, but doesn't specifically say it *only* tracks them at night.
*   **D: Yi hlota swihari leswitsongo ntsena** (It always hunts small animals) - The passage mentions the types of animals it hunts, but not that it *always* hunts small ones. It’s about *how* it finds them, not *what* it hunts.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamuseriki hi ku kongoma ocelot? ,"The correct answer is **D: Yi rhandza ku hlota swihari leswitsongo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ti-ocelot ti rhandza ku dya swihari leswitsongo"" (Ocelots like to eat small mammals). The entire passage revolves around *how* ocelots hunt these small mammals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yi kota ku hlota kahle nivusiku (It can hunt well at night):** While the passage mentions they hunt well at night, it's a *characteristic* that aids their hunting, not the *reason* for their hunting behavior.
* **B: Yi famba yi miyerile (It walks slowly):** The passage doesn't mention their walking speed.
* **C: Ku nun’hwela ka yona a ku tsanile (Its scent is not strong):** The passage mentions they follow prey by scent, implying they *have* a scent capability, but doesn't say it's weak.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki vuswikoti lebyikulu bya yingwe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku vomba**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Swimanga leswi swa mune hi swona ntsena leswi kotaka ku vomba."" (The sounds it makes are few, those that come from roaring.) and then clarifies that a leopard's roar is *different* from a lion's roar, implying roaring is a key characteristic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku khandziya (To climb):** The text mentions climbing, but doesn't present it as a defining characteristic.
* **C: Ku tlula (To surpass/overcome):** The text mentions it surpassing prey, but that's about its hunting ability, not a core characteristic *of* the leopard itself.
* **D: Ku koka (To attract/lure):** This isn't mentioned in the text.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi nga ku hambana exikarhi ka tiyingwe ni tinghala?","The correct answer is **B: Mpfumawulo wa ku vomba ka tona (The manner of roaring)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Ku vomba ka yingwe a ku fani na ku vomba loku heleleke ka nghala, kambe ku fana na xivulwa xa munhu loyi a kwateke loko a huwelela."" (A leopard's roar is not like a lion's deep roar, but is like the sound of a person groaning when in pain.)

This directly highlights a difference in *how* they roar. The other options are mentioned in the text but aren't presented as a key difference between leopards and lions.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, Robert Hooke u endle yini emahlweni ka vutivi va dyondzo ya bayoloji?","The correct answer is **A: Ku vona tisele leti feke** (To see fake cells).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""A a ri munhu wo sungula ku vona tisele leti feke."" (He was the first person to see fake cells.) This directly answers the question of what Robert Hooke did for the field of biology according to the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku languta swilo leswi hanyaka ehansi ka mayikhirosikopi** (Looking at dead things under a microscope) - While he *used* a microscope, this isn't his defining contribution.
* **C: Ku vona swikwayere switsongo** (Seeing cells) - He saw *what he thought were* empty rooms (cells), but he initially called them ""fake cells"" because they weren't living.
* **D: Ku kuma swilo leswitsongo ngopfu hi xivumbeko ni leswi tirhaka eka xivumbiwa** (Finding things that are very cellular in structure and what is used on an organism) - This is a general description of cell study, not Hooke's specific achievement.



"
Rito ro sungula ra “sele” ri vula yini?,"The correct answer is **C: Xivumbeko lexitsongo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sele ri huma eka rito ra Xintariyani cella leri vulaka **kamara leri tsongo**.""  However, the question asks what the *first mention* of ""sele"" refers to. Earlier in the passage, it says: ""Sele I xilo lexitsongo ngopfu hi xivumbeko ni lexi tirhaka eka xivumbiwa lexi hanyaka (swilo)."" This means ""sele"" is initially described as being closely related to a **xivumbeko lexitsongo** (a complex structure).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Swikwayere switsongo** - While the passage *mentions* swikwayere switsongo, it doesn't define the initial concept of ""sele"" as them.
*   **B: Kamara leyitsongo** - This is *an example* of what's *inside* a sele, not what a sele *is* initially.
*   **D: Tibolo letitsongo** - Similar to swikwayere switsongo, these are components seen *within* the ""sele,"" not the initial definition.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, swihari swo tala swi ni vuswikoti byo endla yini?","The correct answer is **B: Ku famba** (To move/travel).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Swiharhi swo tala swa famba famba."" This directly translates to ""Sea turtles move around/travel.""  The rest of the options are things they *do*, but ""famba"" is what the passage specifically says they are *capable* of doing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku haha (To build/make):** While they *build* nests (""swi tlhela swi haha exibakabakeni""), the passage doesn't state this is a core ability of all sea turtles.
*   **C: Ku hlambela (To swim):** They swim, but it's presented as *where* they go, not a fundamental ability.
*   **D: Ku cela (To ask/beg):** This isn't mentioned in the passage at all.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi swihari swin’wana swi nga riki na swona?","The correct answer is **C: Byongo**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""I swiharhi ntsena leswi nga ni byongo (hambileswi a hi swiharhi hinkwaswo; jellyfish hi xikombiso, a ti na mabyongo)."" This translates to: ""Some jellyfish do not have bones (although not all jellyfish; for example, jellyfish do not have bones).""

Therefore, some jellyfish (a type of swiharhi) lack bones, making ""byongo"" (bones) the thing some swihari don't have.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tisele:** The text states swihari *have* tisele (fins).
*   **B: Vuswikoti byo gayela:** The text says swihari *can* swim (gayela).
*   **D: Vuswikoti bya ku dya:** The text says swihari *can* eat (dya).



"
I yini leswi pfunaka swimila eka fambiselo ra fothosinitesisi?,"The correct answer is **C: Swakudya**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Swimila swi endla swakudya hi dyambu eka fothosinitesisi."" This translates to ""Algae make food through photosynthesis.""  Therefore, algae provide food for photosynthesis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndzuti (Water):** While water is *necessary* for photosynthesis, the text doesn't say algae *provide* water *to* photosynthesis.
*   **B: Swihari (Air):**  Similarly, air (specifically carbon dioxide) is used *by* photosynthesis, but algae don't *give* air to it. They take it in.
*   **D: Dyambu (Photosynthesis):** Dyambu is the process itself, not something algae provide *to* the process.



"
Vanhu va humesela yini ehandle leyi swimila swi yi hefumulaka?,"The correct answer is **D: Khaboni-dayiokisayidi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Swimila swi hefemula khaboni-dayiokisayidi leyi vanhu va yi humesaka (sweswo swivula leswaku, leswi va swi humeselaka ehandle).""  This directly translates to ""Plants exhale carbon dioxide that people inhale (meaning they release it outwards).""

Therefore, people exhale carbon dioxide, which plants then use.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga swikombiso leswi nga sivelaka fambiselo ra ku tiendlekela ka swilo?","The correct answer is **C: Swihari swi titoloveta ku hanya endhawini leyintshwa** (Organisms adapt to survive in the new environment).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on how populations change over time to better suit their new environments.** It describes how a population separated into different environments will eventually develop differences as they *adapt* to those new conditions.  This adaptation is the core of how species evolve.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ntlawa lowutsongo wu tsandzeka ku humelela eka ndhawu leyintshwa** (A population spreads to a new environment) - While this *starts* the process, it's not the driving force of evolution. Simply moving doesn't change the organisms.
* **B: Xiphemu xa ntlawa wun’we wa swihari wu rhurhela endhawini leyintshwa** (A portion of a population of organisms moves to a new environment) - This is similar to A; it's the initial separation, but not the evolutionary mechanism.
* **D: Ntlawa wun’we wa swihari u vumba yimbirhi** (One population of organisms forms two) - This is the *result* of speciation, not the process of adaptation itself.  Speciation happens *because* of adaptation over long periods.



"
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamuseriki hi ku kongoma fambiselo ra speciation? ,"The correct answer is **B: I xiphemu xa nkoka xa fambiselo ra ku tiendlekela ka swilo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Speciation hi mbuyelo lowu nga papaletekiki naswona i wa nkoka ngopfu eka dyonzo ya ku tiendlekela ka swilo."" (Speciation is an indispensable process and is very important for understanding the evolution of life). This directly connects speciation to the broader process of evolution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Swi humelela loko swihari leswintshwa swi tsandzeka ku tolovela** (It happens when new species struggle to adapt) - While adaptation is *related* to speciation, the passage doesn't state that struggle is a defining characteristic of the process itself.
* **C: Swi vula ku vumbeka ka swihari leswintshwa** (It speaks of the creation of new species) - This is a *result* of speciation, not a description of the process itself.  The passage describes *how* new species arise, not just *that* they arise.
* **D: Ku humelela ka swona a ku nge papalateki** (Its occurrence is not predictable) - While the specifics can be complex, the passage emphasizes that speciation is a fundamental and consistent process, not random or unpredictable.



"
I xiphemu xihi xa mafambiselo ya ngati lama rhendzelekaka lexi tisaka ngati embilwini?,"The correct answer is **A: Tiatheri**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngati yi suka embilwini hi tiphayiphi leti vitaniwaka **tiatheri**..."" (The blood leaves the heart through pipes called arteries...). This directly answers the question of what takes blood *from* the heart.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tikhaphilari:** The passage states capillaries are *small* pipes, not the ones leaving the heart.
*   **C: Swirho:** ""Swirho"" means blood, not a structure that carries it.
*   **D: Tivheyini:** The passage says blood *enters* the heart through veins (""yi tlhelela embilwini hi ti phayiphi leti vitaniwaka tivheyini""), not leaves.



"
I tiphayiphi tihi letitsongo-tsongo eka mafambiselo ya ngati lama rhendzelekaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Tikhaphilari**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tiphayiphi letitsongo ti vitaniwa tikhaphilari."" which translates to ""The small pipes are found in capillaries.""  Therefore, capillaries are the small pipes involved in the circulation described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tiatheri** - The passage says arteries *carry* blood *from* the heart.
* **C: Tivheyini** - The passage says veins *carry* blood *to* the heart.
* **D: Swirho** -  ""Swirho"" means veins in this context, but the question asks for the *smallest* pipes.



"
Vuswikoti bya switsotswana bya ku tumbela timpiko ta swona byi andzisa yini eka leswi landzelaka?,"The correct answer is **B: Tindhawu to tumbela** (Nesting sites).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Leswi swi tinyika **ndhawu to tala ta ku tumbela** eka swiharhi leswi swidyaka."" (This gives them many **nesting sites** on the plants they visit).  It specifically links the ability to fly to having more places to nest.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mphakelo wa swakudya** (Food supply) - While flying *helps* them find food, the passage doesn't say the ability to fly *increases* the food supply itself.
* **C: Ku kuma vanghani va vukati** (Finding mates) - The passage mentions finding mates, but doesn't link it directly to the ability to fly and nest.
* **D: Rivilo ra ku haha** (Ability to build) - The passage mentions building, but focuses on *where* they build (nesting sites) not the building ability itself being increased.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga si vuriwa eka ndzimana tanihi xilo lexi khumbiwaka hi vuswikoti bya ku haha ka switsotswana?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku hlengeleta swakudya (Foraging for food)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Leswaku ti kota ku haha ku ti pfuna ti baleka nala hi ndlela ya ku olova ni ku kuma swakudya na vanghani va vu kati."" (So they can build and protect themselves to run well by hunting and finding food with their communities.) This directly relates to foraging for food.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Ku veleka (Reproduction):** While important, the passage doesn't *primarily* focus on reproduction.
    * **B: Mpimo wa vutomi (Lifespan):** The passage mentions a general ability to live, but doesn't detail lifespan.
    * **D: Ku tirha kahle (Efficiency):** While implied, the passage is more about *how* they survive (finding food) than simply being efficient.

Therefore, the key skill highlighted in the passage as being vital to the ants' survival is finding food.



"
I swihlawulekisi swihi leswi hi ntolovelo swi nga fambisaniki na tidayinasora?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku famba hi milenge ya le ndzhaku** (Walking on two legs).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Swi famba hi milenge ya le ndzhaku ku fana na T-Rex"" (It walks on two legs like a T-Rex). This directly links the creatures described to the way dinosaurs walk.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tinsiva (Teeth):** While the passage mentions they *have* teeth, it doesn't say this is a defining characteristic linking them to dinosaurs.
* **C: Ku vekela matandza (Having scales):**  The passage mentions scales, but it's just *one* feature, not the primary connection to dinosaurs.
* **D: Milenge leyi nga ni minwala (Limbs with claws):** Again, claws are mentioned, but not presented as the main similarity.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga tekiwiki tanihi xihlawulekisi xa swinyenyani ni ti dayinasora?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku vekela matandza (Having feathers)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Swi na milenge leyi nga ni mahakatimba na minwala, swi vekela matandza..."" (It has scales and claws, *it has feathers*...).  This directly links feathers to both dinosaurs and the creatures being discussed.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ku famba hi milenge ya le ndzhaku (Walking on two legs):** While the passage mentions T-Rex walked on two legs, this isn't a unique feature distinguishing these creatures *from* dinosaurs. Many dinosaurs walked on two legs.
* **C: Vuswikoti bya ku haha (Ability to build):** The passage says they can build, but this is stated as a characteristic *of* the creatures, not as a point of similarity to dinosaurs.
* **D: Milenge leyi nga ni minwala (Scales and claws):**  Again, scales and claws are common to many reptiles and dinosaurs, not a specific link differentiating these creatures.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i xiphemu xihi xa swimila swa ncindzu lexi ku nga endlekaka leswaku Triceratop yi xi dya?","The correct answer is **A: Matluka lama nga tsontswa** (Roots that are torn up).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Swimila leswi swi fana na murhi wa ncindzu lowutsongo lowu nga ni harhi ya matluka lama tlhavaka, **ni lama nga tsontswa**."" (These plants were like tough cypress trees with both established roots and **torn up roots**).  It then goes on to say Triceratops would use its beak to pull up these roots to eat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nsinya** (Wood) - The passage says Triceratops used its beak to *pull up* roots, not to eat wood.
*   **C: Timitsu** (Leaves) - While leaves are part of a plant, the passage focuses on the roots.
*   **D: Mbhandzu** (Bark) - The passage mentions bark in the context of animals *other* than Triceratops being able to eat tough bark, but not Triceratops itself.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi Triceratop swi nga endlekaka leswaku yi swi dya? ","The correct answer is **B: Swimila swa marhavi lama tiyeke**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Van’wana va vativi va sayense va ehleketa leswaku ti Triceratops a ti dya swimila swa ncindzu, leswi nga muxaka wa ximilla lowu a wu tolovelekile enkarhirini wa Cretaceous...Swimila leswi swi fana na murhi wa ncindzu lowutsongo lowu nga ni harhi ya matluka lama tlhavaka, ni lama nga tsontswa.""  This directly translates to ""Some scientists believe that Triceratops ate the fruits of trees, like a type of plum that was common during the Cretaceous period...These fruits were like hard plum trees with both ripe and unripe plums.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sloth** - The passage mentions sloths as an example of an animal that *can* eat tough plants, but doesn't say Triceratops ate them.
*   **C: Hokwe** - (Hokwe = antelope)  Similar to sloths, antelopes are used as a comparison, not as something Triceratops ate.
*   **D: Swimila leswi nga ni mbhandzu lowu nga ni chefu** - (Fruits with a lot of fiber) While the passage does mention tough/fibrous plants *in comparison* to what Triceratops ate, it specifically states Triceratops ate plums/tree fruits.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""P: Bolo ya milenge ya tiko ra Italiya, swin’we ni bolo ya milenge ya tiko ra Xijarimani i ntlawa wa vumbirhi lowu nga humelela emisaveni naswona a ku ri tinghwazi ta Khapu ya Misava ya FiFA hi 2006."" This directly links football (bolo ya milenge) to a significant event (the 2006 FIFA World Cup victory) and emphasizes its importance in Italy.  The passage then says this sport is very popular in Northern Italy.

The other options are mentioned as popular sports in Italy, but are not specifically highlighted as being *particularly* popular in Northern Italy like football is.



"
"Hi ku ya hi rungula leri nga nyikeriwa eka ndzimana, i ntlangu wihi eka leyi landzelaka lowu nga hlula ku va tinghwazi ta misava eItaliya?","The correct answer is **A: Bolo ya milenge**.

The passage states: ""...swin’we ni bolo ya milenge ya tiko ra Xijarimani i ntlawa wa vumbirhi lowu nga humelela emisaveni naswona a ku ri tinghwazi ta Khapu ya Misava ya FiFA hi 2006.""  This directly links Germany's football (bolo ya milenge) team to winning the FIFA World Cup in 2006, beating Italy.

The other options are simply listed as popular sports in Italy and don't have the specific connection to defeating Italy in a major championship.



"
Hi le ndzhaku ka xiendlakalo xihi laha swiphemu swin’wana swa Luxembourg swi nga va Belgium?,"The correct answer is **B: Nhlunga-vuhosi wa le Belgium**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Swiphemu swa Belgium ya namuntlha a ku ri xiphemu xa Luxembourg hi nkarhi lowu hundzeke kambe yi xiphemu xa Belgium endzhaku ka Nhlunga-vuhosi wa le Belgium was 1830."" This directly links the parts of Luxembourg being part of Belgium to the Belgian Revolution of 1830.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nyimpi yo Sungula ya Misava:** The passage mentions this as a time Luxembourg was *invaded* by Germany, not when it was part of Belgium.
*   **C: Nyimpi ya Vumbirhi ya Misava:** Same as above - an invasion, not a period of being part of Belgium.
*   **D: Ku sunguriwa ka European Union:** This is a much later event and doesn't relate to Luxembourg being a part of Belgium.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga khumba vukala-tlhelo bya Luxembourg?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku hlaseriwa hi Jarimani** (Being invaded by Germany).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Luxembourg a yi tshama yi ringeta ku tshama yi ri tiko leri nga ni vukala-tlhelo kambe yi hlaseriwe hi Jarimani hi Nyimpi yo Sungula ya Misava ni Nyimpi ya Vumbirhi ya Misava hi vumbirhi."" (Luxembourg did not remain untouched and was invaded by Germany in both the First and Second World Wars).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ku nghenelela eka European Union** (Joining the European Union): While Luxembourg was a founding member, this doesn't relate to a *loss* of sovereignty.
*   **C: Nhlunga-vuhosi wa le Belgium** (Belgian Revolution): This explains a part of Luxembourg's history but doesn't represent a period where it lost control of its affairs.
*   **D: Ku va tiko leri nga ti yimela** (Being an independent country): The text says Luxembourg didn't *stay* independent, implying it *was* independent but then lost that status. The invasion by Germany is the reason.



"
I swikwere-khilomitara swingani swa ndhawu hinkwayo ya Turkey le Yuropa?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The text states: ""Ndhawu ya Turkey...yi endla swikwere-khilomitara swa 23,764 (9,174 sq mi) e Yuropa."" (Turkey's area...includes 23,764 (9,174 sq mi) in Europe.)



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, Turkey yi lehe timayili tingani?","The correct answer is **D: 1000**.

The text states: ""Ndhawu ya Turkey i hundza tikhilomitara ta 1,600 (1,000 miles) hi ku leha ni 800 km (500 mi) hi ku anama, hi xivumbeko xa bokisi.""  This directly translates to ""The area of Turkey stretches 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) in length and 800 km (500 mi) in width.""

Therefore, Turkey is 1,000 miles long."
Ririmi ra Xilatin ri tirhiseriwa yini eka Vatican City?,"The correct answer is **A: Minkhuvo ya vukhongeri**.

The passage states: ""Xilatin xi tirhisiwa eka minkhuvo ya vukhongeri minkarhi yin’wana."" (Xilatin is used in religious ceremonies sometimes.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mbulavurisano wa siku ni siku (Daily communication):** The passage says Xintariyani (Italian) is used for daily communication.
* **C: Eka mfumo (In government):** The passage states Xintariyani is used for government purposes.
* **D: Ku vulavurisana kale nawini (Negotiations with other countries):** The passage says Xintariyani is used for negotiations with other countries.



"
"Le Vatican City, Xintariyani a xi tirhisiweli yini?","The correct answer is **A: Eka mfumo** (In the government).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vatican City yi tirhisa Xintariyani eka mfumo wa vona..."" which translates to ""Vatican City uses Italian in its government."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ku vulavurisana kale nawini** (To communicate with the outside world) - While Italian *might* be used for this, the passage specifically links it to the *government*.
*   **C: Minkhuvo ya vukhongeri** (Religious ceremonies) - The passage says Latin is used for religious ceremonies, not Italian.
*   **D: Mbulavurisano wa siku ni siku** (Daily communication) - The passage states Italian is used for daily life *by those working for the government*, not as a general daily communication language for everyone.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi vuyeriwaka eka ku hlanganisa mimpfumawulo eka tikhompyutha ta xiyimo xa le henhla?","The correct answer is **A: Vuyimbeleri**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vuyimbeleri nkarhi wun’wana byi kandziyisiwa hi ku tirhisa tikhompyutha ta xiyimo xa le henhla leswaku ti fambisa ni ku hlanganisa mimpfumawulo yo hambana.""  This translates to ""Special effects are sometimes created by using high-end computers to manipulate and combine different images.""  Therefore, *vuyimbeleri* (special effects) is what's being used to combine images with computers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tipopayi (Animations):** While computers *are* used for animation, the passage specifically mentions combining *different images*, not creating animations themselves.
* **C: Swifaniso (Images):** Images are what are being combined, but aren't the *process* or tool used for combination.
* **D: Ku endliwa (Being made/done):** This is too general and doesn't refer to a specific element used in the process.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, hi ku tala ka makaya ya le ka ndhawu yihi lama nga ni swihambukelo swo tirhisa mati?","The correct answer is **A: E Mohenjo-daro**.

The passage specifically states: ""Madoroba ya Harappa na Mohenjo-daro a ya ri na xihambukelo xo tirhisa mati eka kwalomu ka tiyindlu hinkwato..."" (The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had plumbing systems that used water for all houses...).

The other options are mentioned as having plumbing *generally*, but not specifically as having systems for *all* houses like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.



"
Hi le ka tindhawu tihi eka leti landzelaka laha ku nga kumiwa soreji ya xiyimo xa le henhla?,"The correct answer is **A: Le Harappa**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Madoroba ya Harappa na Mohenjo-daro a ya ri na xihambukelo xo tirhisa mati eka kwalomu ka tiyindlu hinkwato, **lexi khomanisiweke ni soreji ya xiyimo xa le henhla**."" 

This directly links Harappa to having a sophisticated drainage system (and therefore, a concern for weather conditions/upper climates). The other options are mentioned as having plumbing/drainage, but *not* specifically connected to a ""soreji ya xiyimo xa le henhla"" (upper climate drainage).



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi endlaka munhu loyi a tswiririkaka eayisini a jika?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku voyamela etlhelo ehansi ka nsimbi ya xilo xa ku tswiririka eayisini** (The tilting of the edge under the metal of the spinning top).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hikuva ehansi ka nsimbi ku petsiwe kahle, loko nsimbi yi voyamela etlhelo rin’wana, tlhelo leri khumbaneke ni ayisi na rona ra voyama. Leswi swi endla leswaku munhu la fambaka hi xona a jika."" (Because underneath the metal is well-polished, when the metal tilts to one edge, the edge connected to the base also tilts. This causes the person walking on it to tilt.)

The passage directly links the tilting of the edge under the metal to the person tilting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Matlhelo mambirhi eka nsimbi ya xilo xa ku tswiririka eayisini** (The two edges on the metal of the spinning top) - While the edges are *involved*, they aren't the direct cause of the tilting *for the person*.  It's the tilting *of* an edge that causes the effect.
* **C: Mpimo wa vuswikoti bya munhu loyi a tswiriririkaka eayisini** (The weight measurement of the person spinning on the top) - Weight isn't mentioned as a factor.
* **D: Xiyimo xa ayisi** (The condition of the base) - The base (ayisi) is only mentioned as being connected to the tilting edge, not as the direct cause of the person tilting.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma ku goveka ka nsimbi ya xilo xa ku tswiririka eayisini xa masiku lama?","The correct answer is **A: Matlhelo mambirhi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nsimbi leyi nga kona eka xilo xa ku tswiririka eayisini xa masiku lama ku ni **matlhelo mambirhi** lama govekeke laha ma hlanganaka kona."" (This lever on the balancing beam has **two ends** that are fixed where they meet.)

The passage explains the lever works *because* of these two ends. The other options describe *what the lever does* (voyamela - moves, gombonyoka - breaks) or a *state* of the lever (voyamile - moved), but they don't explain *what makes it a lever* in the first place.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini fambiselo ra ku pfumelela tiathomu ku susa matimba lama engetelekeke lama ti ma kumeke eka rivoningo?","The correct answer is **D: Mahumeselo ya nyawuso lama endliweke**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Va n’wasayense va vita fambiselo leri nge “mahumeselo ya nyawuso lama endliweke” hikuva tiathomu ti endliwa hi rivoni leri vangamaka...""  This directly links the process of enabling atoms to release energy to ""mahumeselo ya nyawuso lama endliweke"" (controlled nuclear reactions).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nyanyuso** - While the passage mentions atoms are the basis, it doesn't say *nyanyuso* is the method of releasing energy.
* **B: Mahumeselo ya tifothoni leti endliweke** -  The passage describes *how* photons are emitted, but not that controlling photons is the method to release energy from atoms.
* **C: Tifothoni** - Photons are *a result* of the process, not the process itself.



"
I yini lexi vangaka leswaku athomu yi humesa fothoni?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku endliwa loku vangiwaka hi rivoni leri vangamaka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...tiathomu ti endliwa hi rivoni leri vangamaka, leri ri endlaka leswaku yi humesa fothoni ya rivoni...""  This directly translates to ""...atoms are made by a visible ray, which causes it to emit photons of the ray...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku humesa matimba lama engetelekeke (Releasing accumulated energy)** - While the passage mentions releasing energy, it's *how* the atoms emit photons, not *why* they emit them in the first place.
* **C: Mpimo wa matimba lowu cinca-cincaka (Measurement of fluctuating energy)** - The passage doesn't focus on measuring energy, but on the emission of photons.
* **D: Vuyelo lebyi nga riki byinene eka nyanyuso (Reaction that is not very strong on the surface)** - The passage doesn't discuss the strength of a reaction on a surface.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eku heteleleni loku nga ta vanga leswaku rivoni ri tshika ku tirha?","The correct answer is **C: Filamenti leyi nga le ndzeni ka rivoni ya tshwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Endzhaku ka nkarhi ya tshwa naswona rivoni ri tshika ku tirha."" which translates to ""Eventually, the filament inside the bulb burns out and the bulb stops working.""  This directly links a burnt-out filament to the bulb failing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Rivoni a ri timiwi hi ndlela ya kahle** (The bulb is not installed correctly) - While improper installation *could* cause issues, the passage doesn't mention this as a reason for failure.
* **B: Loko ndhawu ya nsimbi eka rivoni yi ri endzeni ka sokhethi hi xiphemu** (When the metal part of the bulb is inside the socket with a piece) -  The passage discusses this in the context of *changing* a bulb safely, not why it stops working.
* **D: Gezi leri fambaka eka sokhete ra hunguteka** (The wire running to the socket is loose) - While a loose wire could cause a problem, the passage focuses on the internal failure of the filament.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi ku nga endlekaka leswaku swi va ni khombo ku swi khoma loko u cinca rivoni?,"The correct answer is **A: Filamenti**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...gezi leri fambaka eka sokhete laha xiphemu xa rivoni xi tshamaka kona xi nga ku chowuka ngopfu loko u khoma le ndzeni ya sokhete..."" This refers to the filament being fragile and easily broken if touched while hot.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Swichi ya rivoni (Rivoni switch):** While the passage mentions turning off the switch or removing the fuse *before* changing the bulb, it's not what could be broken by touching it.
* **C: Ndhawu ya nsimbi ya rivoni (Metal part of the bulb):** The passage warns about touching the metal part *while the filament is hot*, but the metal part itself isn't what's fragile.
* **D: Ntambhu (Fuse):** Removing the fuse is a safety precaution, but the fuse itself won't break if touched.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ku endleka yini loko ku hambanisiwa nyutliliya?","The correct answer is **B: Ku humesiwa matimba** (Energy is released).

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states: ""Ku hambanisiwa nyutliliya nakambe kutani ku humesiwa matimba wolawo."" This translates to ""When fission occurs, energy is released.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku kumiwa ka ti phurothoni** (Protons are formed) - While protons are involved *in* the nucleus, the fission process doesn't primarily *create* them.
* **C: Ti athomu ti sungula ku nga tiyi** (Atoms begin to decay) - Fission *is* a type of decay, but the primary result isn't simply ""starting to decay,"" it's the release of energy.
* **D: Ti nyutironi ta lahleka** (Neutrons are lost) - Neutrons *are* released in fission, and are crucial for continuing the chain reaction, but the main outcome described in the passage is energy release.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi kombaka ku fonela munhu wa le kule laha Misaveni,"The correct answer is **A: Tithelesikopi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Va n’wasayense va tirhisa tithelesikopi le mpfhukeni hikuva atimosifiye ya Misava yi kavanyeta rivoni na ku vona kun’wana ka hina."" (Scientists use telescopes because the atmosphere of Mars is dusty and obscures our view.)  This directly links telescopes to being able to see/reach people on Mars.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tisethalayiti (Satellites):** While satellites are *placed* by rockets, the passage says they are used for observing, not directly communicating with someone.
* **C: Mavoni (Dust):** Dust obscures vision, it doesn't *enable* communication.
* **D: Tirhoketi (Rockets):** Rockets are used to *launch* things, but aren't the tool for seeing/communicating.

I yini eka leswi swa ku tirhiseriwa ku veka thelesikopi le mpfhukeni?,"The correct answer is **B: Tirhoketi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku laveka rhoketi leyikulu leyi hundzaka 100 feet yi vekiwe le mpfhukeni leswaku u veka sathelayiti kumbe thelesikopi le mpfhukeni."" (A large rocket, 100 feet tall, is needed to launch to put a satellite or telescope into space.)

Therefore, rockets are used to launch telescopes into space.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Miseve yo voninga** (Research ships) - The passage doesn't mention research ships.
*   **C: Atimosifiye ya Misava** (Atmosphere of Mars) - While the atmosphere is *why* telescopes are useful, it's not what *launches* them.
*   **D: Tisethalayiti ta ku hundza 100 feet kuya ehenhla** (Satellites to launch 100 feet upwards) - The passage says the rocket is 100 feet tall, not the satellites. Also, launching only 100 feet wouldn't get a telescope into space.



"
I yini lexi faneleke xi xiyiwa hi xiendlakalo lexi fambaka bya xirhendzevutani leswaku u fungha ndlela leyi nkarhi wu fambaka ha yona?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku phindha-phindha** (Repetition).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Xiendlakalo lexi fambaka bya xirhendzevutani i xilo lexi endlekaka hi ku **phindha phindha** minkarhi hinkwayo."" This directly translates to ""A cyclical event is something that is created by **repeating** every time."" 

The passage uses the cyclical event as a way to *understand* how time moves – by recognizing patterns of repetition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku leha (To flow)** - While time *feels* like it flows, the passage focuses on the *pattern* of flow, not the flow itself.
* **C: Ku khumba (To encompass/surround)** - This doesn't relate to the concept of a cyclical event.
* **D: Ku tika (To be correct/accurate)** - This refers to understanding time, not the method of understanding it (the cyclical event).



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i xiphemu xihi xa xiendlakalo lexi nkarhi u tirhiseriwaka ku swi ringanisa?","The correct answer is **B: Ku phindha-phindha** (Repetition).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Xiendlakalo lexi fambaka bya xirhendzevutani i xilo lexi endlekaka hi ku phindha phindha minkarhi hinkwayo."" This translates to ""The cyclical pattern is something that is created by repeating endlessly.""  The passage links time's measurement to this cyclical pattern.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku leha** (Flowing) - While the passage mentions time ""flowing,"" it doesn't identify this as *the* pattern used for measurement.
*   **C: Ntokoto** (Beginning) - The passage discusses time in relation to events, not specifically beginnings.
*   **D: Ku khumba** (Covering) - This doesn't relate to how time is understood or measured in the passage.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi tekiwaka tanihi lexi tolovelekeke hi mudyandzhaka wa xiluvelo?","The correct answer is **B: Ku tshika university leswaku a ya evusocheni** (Not going to university to study).

Here's why:

The passage states the young man was *supposed* to go to university after school (""mudyandzhaka wa xiluvelo a ta ya evusocheni hi ku kongoma loko a hete xikolo""). However, Charles *did* go to university, defying expectations.  This is presented as the significant, noteworthy event – the thing the passage highlights as ""to lovelekeke"" (remarkable).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku kuma digri ya 2:2 (Getting a 2:2 degree)** - While mentioned, it's presented as a result of his studies, not the remarkable thing itself.
* **C: Ku Dyondza Matimu (Studying Theology)** - This is what he *did* study, not the surprising aspect.
* **D: Ku ya le univhesithi a nga si ya evusocheni (Going to university without planning to)** - This is close, but the passage emphasizes he was *expected* not to go, not that he went without planning.



"
"Hi ku ya hi rungula leri nga nyikeriwa eka ndzimana, Charles a ku ri wa masungulo wa ku endla yini?","The correct answer is **C: Ku kuma digri**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Charles a ku ri xirho xo sungula xa Ndyangu wa le Vuhosini le Britain xo nyikiwa digri."" This directly translates to ""...Charles was the first person of the British Royal Family to be awarded a degree.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku ya evusocheni a nga si heta xikolo** - While the passage mentions him going to school, it doesn't say this was his main achievement.
* **B: Ku Dyondza Vuyimburi** - He studied Anthropology and Archaeology, then Mathematics, but getting the degree is the breakthrough mentioned.
* **D: Ku nghena le Trinity College** -  Entering Trinity College was a step *towards* getting the degree, but not the achievement itself.



"
I tiko rihi laha nxaxamelo wa swikepe wa Trygvasson a wu huma kona?,"The correct answer is **D: E Norway**.

The text explicitly states: ""Nxaxamelo lowu wa swikepe a wu rhangeriwe hi Olaf Trygvasson, **muNorway**..."" (This fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, **from Norway**...).



"
Hi le ka nkarhi wihi eka matimu laha Jarimani a yi ri ni nkucetelo wa ndhavuko lowukulu eka Estonia?,"The correct answer is **D: Kwalomu ka malembe ya 800 lama hundzeke**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""lembe xidzana ra vu 15, Estonia ya le n’walungu a yi ri ehansi ka nkucetelo wa ndhavuko lowukulu wa Jarimani.""  This translates to ""In the 15th century, Estonia was under the rule of a large German influence.""  

To calculate roughly how long ago the 15th century was from now (2024), we do: 2024 - 1400 = 624. However, German influence started *before* the 15th century and continued for a significant period. The text implies a long-standing, substantial influence. Therefore, 800 years is the closest and most reasonable estimate reflecting the extended period of German cultural impact.



"
Ririmi ra Estonia ri kuceteriwe hi yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Letere ra Õ/õ** (The letter Õ/õ).

Here's why:

The text states: ""A ri sekeriwe eka letere ra Xijarimani naswona letere rin’we ra """"Õ/õ"""" ri engeteriwile."" This translates to ""It was secured in a German letter and one letter """"Õ/õ"""" was included.""  This directly links the letter Õ/õ to the preservation/representation of the Estonian language.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maletere ya Xijarimani:** While a German letter was *used*, it wasn't the letter itself that preserved the language, but the inclusion of the Estonian letter within it.
* **C: Tinghwendza ta Majarimani:** The Germans tried to suppress the language, not preserve it.
* **D: Xikwembu:**  (God)  This is not mentioned as being related to the preservation of the Estonian language in the text.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, nhlayo ya vanhu lava vulavulaka Xihindi yi cinca-cinca hi ku ya hi xivangelo xihi?","The correct answer is **A: Loko swindzimana leswi yelanaka ni Xihindi swi hlayiwa** (If dialects related to Hindi are counted).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku ringanyeta ku suka eka vavulavuri lava sukaka eka 340 ya timiliyoni ku ya eka 500 ya timiliyoni, nakambe kwalomu ka vanhu va 800 ya timiliyoni va kota ku twisisa ririmi leri."" This means the number of Hindi speakers varies depending on whether you include related dialects in the count.  The range (340-500 million) reflects this difference.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Loko vanhu lava vulavulaka Xiurdu va hlayiwa** - The passage states Hindi and Urdu are similar but distinct, and counting Urdu speakers wouldn’t change the *Hindi* speaker count.
* **C: Loko vanhu lava twisisaka ririmi va hlayiwa** - Understanding a language isn't the same as *speaking* it. The passage gives a separate number for those who can understand (800 million).
* **D: Loko lava kotaka ku hlaya ririmi va hlayiwa** - The passage focuses on those who *do* speak the language, not those who *can* learn it.



"
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga ntiyiso mayelana ni tindzimi ta Xihindi na Xiurdu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku va ni ku nga twisisani exikarhi ka vavulavuri va tindzimi teto timbirhi** (That speakers of the two languages can understand each other).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...vavulavuri va tindzimi leti hi vumbirhi hi ntolovelo va swi kota ku twisisana."" which translates to ""...speakers of these two languages generally can understand each other.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: A ti fani hi matsalelo** (They differ in vocabulary) - The passage *confirms* they differ in vocabulary (""...swi hambane hi matsalelo""). But this isn't the main point about understanding.
* **C: Ti fana havumbirhi hi marito ni matsalelo** (They are alike in both grammar and vocabulary) - The passage states they are *alike in grammar* (""Xihindi ni Xiurdu swa fana hi marito"") but *different in vocabulary*.
* **D: A ti fani hi marito** (They differ in grammar) - The passage states they *are alike in grammar*.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki ntiyiso hi letere ra Hangeul?,"The correct answer is **B: Vito ra letere ra le masungulweni a ku ri Hunam Jeongeum**.

Here's why:

* The text states the original name of Hangeul was **Hunmin Jeongeum**, not Hunam Jeongeum. This is the discrepancy.

Let's look at why the other options are correct and therefore *not* the answer:

* **A: Ri endliwe emasungulweni ya ku fuma ka Hosi Sejong** - The text explicitly states it was created in 1444 during Sejong's reign.
* **C: Ri endliwe hi hosi ya vumune ya Ntlhandlamano wa Tihosi wa Joseon** - The text confirms Sejong was a benevolent king of the Joseon Dynasty.
* **D: Ri endliwe hi vomu** - While the text doesn't explicitly state *who* created it, it implies it was created under the direction of King Sejong, so it wasn't created randomly.



"
Letere ra Hunmin Jeongeum eku heteleleni ri cinciwile ri va yini?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Eku sunguleni u thye letere ra Hangeul vito leri nge Hunmin Jeongeum..."" which translates to ""Initially, the letter of Hangeul was called Hunmin Jeongeum..."". This directly links Hunmin Jeongeum as the original name *for* Hangeul.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sejong** - Sejong was the *king who created* the letter, not the letter's original name.
* **C: Joseon** - Joseon was the dynasty, the kingdom, not the letter's name.
* **D: Jeongeum** - Jeongeum is part of the full name Hunmin *Jeongeum*, but not the complete original name of the alphabet itself.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i tindzimi tihi leti nga kuceteriwa hi Xisanskrit?","The correct answer is **B: Tindzimi ta le Yuropa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Xisanskrit i nga fanisiwa ni ririmi ra Xilatini leri vulavuriwaka eYuropa...loko Xilatini ku ri xihlovo xa tindzimi ta le Yuropa ta ku fana ni Xifurwa ni Xipaniya.""  This directly links Sanskrit to being an ancestor/foundation for European languages *through* Latin.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tindzimi ta Xilatin:** While related, Sanskrit isn't just the ancestor of Latin; it's the ancestor of a broader group.
*   **C: Tindzimi ta khale:**  This is too broad. The passage focuses on the *influence* of Sanskrit on modern languages.
*   **D: Tindzimi ta le Indiya:** The passage mentions Sanskrit's arrival *in* India, but its influence extends beyond just languages of India (via Latin to Europe).



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ku tirhisiwa ka Xisanskrit ku pfe ku nyamalala hikwalaho ka yini?","The correct answer is **D: Ntlawa wa valawuri**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Endzhaku ka ku hlengeletiwa ka Vaupanishad, Xisanskrit xo pfa xi nyamalala hikwalaho ka ntlawa wa valawuri.""  This directly translates to ""Due to the influence of the Upanishads, Sanskrit almost disappeared due to the efforts of scholars.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ru rharhangana** - While the passage states Sanskrit is complex, it doesn't link this to its near disappearance.
*   **B: Ku rhurha ka Vaaryan** - The passage mentions the Aryan migration as its origin, not its decline.
*   **C: Tindzimi ta Xilatin** - The passage compares Sanskrit to Latin, but doesn't say Latin caused its decline.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi kongomeke malunghana ni nkoka-misava wa lo?","The correct answer is **B: Nkoka-misava wa lo u koka ngopfu, hikwalaho u nga ta tika katsongo.**

Here's why:

The passage states ""Kutani nkoka-misava, hakunene, u nge ku koke ngopfu."" (But the scale, truly, doesn't weigh much).  It then illustrates this by saying a 200lb person weighs only 36lbs on it. This clearly indicates the scale *doesn't weigh much* or *weighs lightly*.  Therefore, it's a scale that doesn't weigh accurately or heavily – it weighs *ngopfu* (lightly).  Because it doesn't weigh much, it won't be able to accurately measure a heavy object (""nga ta tika katsongo"" - won't weigh accurately).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't compare the scale to another scale (""Nkoka-misava wa Misava"").
* **C:**  The passage states it *doesn't* weigh much, so saying it weighs ""ngopfu"" (lightly) *and* won't weigh at all is contradictory.
* **D:** Again, there's no comparison to a ""Nkoka-misava wa Misava"".



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma leyara ya le handle ya N’weti?","The correct answer is **A: Etlhelo ra le kusuhi khirasiti yi bumbule**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Leyara ya le handle ya N’weti ri vuriwa khrasti...Khirasiti yi bumbule kwalomu ka 70 km etlhelo ra le kusuhi naswona yi bumbule 100 km etlhelo ra le kule."" This directly describes the crater's impact on the near side of the moon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Khirasiti yi lari eka tindhawu leti tlakukeke** - While true, this is a general statement and doesn't *specifically* describe the impact on the far side.
* **C: Ku nga ha va ni swigodhi leswitsongo etlhelo ra le kule** - The passage says the crater *impacted* 100km on the far side, not that there were many craters there.
* **D: Ku nga ha va ni swigodhi leswitsongo eka tindhawu leti tlakukeke** - The passage mentions potential craters on the near side *because* of the impact, not generally on rough terrain.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, khirasiti ya N’weti yi bubumele ngopfu kwihi?","The correct answer is **A: Etlhelo ra le kusuhi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Khirasiti yi bumbule kwalomu ka 70 km etlhelo ra le kusuhi naswona yi bumbule 100 km etlhelo ra le kule."" This directly translates to ""The crater was formed 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.""  Therefore, the crater is most prominent/formed on the near side (etlhelo ra le kusuhi).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Laha ku nga ni swigodhi swo tala (Where there are many cracks):** While cracks are mentioned, it doesn't say the crater *formed* there.
* **C: Ehansi ka tindhawu leti tlakukeke (Underneath broken areas):**  The crater caused the broken areas, it didn't form underneath them.
* **D: Ehansi ka swigodhi (Underneath cracks):** Similar to C, the crater caused the cracks, not the other way around.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi tshembiwaka hi vanhu vo karhi?","The correct answer is **C: Ku na vutomi eka tipulanethe tin’wana** (There is life on other planets).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""va n’wana va tshemba leswaku swilo swin’wana kumbe vutomi vun’wana va pulanethe yin’wana yi nga tshama eka ximilana xin’wana."" This translates to ""some believe that something or life on another planet might exist on another side."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vanhu va ye eka tinyeleti tin’wana** (People go to other stars) - The passage discusses *believing* in life elsewhere, not actually traveling there.
* **B: Vanhu a va koti ku vona misava yin’wana** (People cannot see other worlds) - The passage implies people *hope* to see other worlds.
* **D: Ku na ehansi ka timayile ta triliyoni exikarhi ka tinyeleti** (There are trillions of miles between stars) - While true, this is a statement of *fact* about distance, not what people *believe*.



"
I yini leswi nga lala loku u ya kule na xikarhi xa dyambu?,"The correct answer is **C: Gasi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gasi yi va yo lala loko u ya kule na xikarhi xa dyambu."" which translates to ""Gas is what you find when you go into the center of the nebula.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Plasma:** While plasma is *part* of the nebula, the passage specifically says gas is found at the center.
*   **B: Ndzilo:** (Dust) - Also a component, but not what's found *at the center*.
*   **D: Khirasiti:** (Crystal) - This isn't mentioned in the passage at all.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i xiphemu xihi xa dyambu lexi nga vonakala ku suka eka Misava?","The correct answer is **C: Photosphere**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Xiphemu xa le handle lexi hi xi vonaka loko hi languta dyambu xi vitaniwa photosphere, leyi vulaka “bolo ya rivoningo”.""  This directly translates to ""The outer layer that we see when looking at a star is called the photosphere, also known as 'surface of investigation'.""
* The passage also says Dyambu (stars) have layers like the Sun, and you can see the outer layer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Khiurasiti (Christi)** - This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **B: Plasma** - While the passage mentions plasma *is part of* the star, it's not the specific layer we *see* from afar.
* **D: Xikarhi (Core)** - The core is the center of the star, not the visible outer layer.



"
I ku voniwa ka yini loku nga pfuneta ku tiyisisa dyondzo ya Copernicus?,"The correct answer is **A: Swiyenge swa Venus**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Swiyenge swa Venus a swi seketela dyondzo ya Copernicus ya leswaku tipulanete ti rhendzeleka Dyambu."" (The phases of Venus supported Copernicus's theory that planets revolve around the Sun).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku suka ka Venus** -  While Horrocks observed a transit of Venus, the passage doesn't state this *supported* the Copernican theory, only that it was observed.
* **C: Ku fana ka Dyambu na Venus** - The similarity to the sun is implied by the phases, but the *phases themselves* are the key evidence.
* **D: Ku fana ka Dyambu na N’weti** -  The passage points out Venus having phases *like* the moon, but the important part is how this related to the Copernican model, not just the similarity.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga voniwa hi Galileo Galilei hi 1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Swiyenge swa Venus**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Galileo Galilei... used a telescope to see that Venus has phases, like the moon does."" This means he observed the different appearances of Venus as it orbits the sun, which are called phases.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tlhelo ra N’weti leri nga languta eka Dyambu:** While the passage compares Venus's phases to the moon's, Galileo observed the phases of Venus, not the moon.
*   **C: Tipulanethi leti nga rhendzeleka Dyambu:** Galileo's observation *supported* Copernicus's theory of planets revolving around the sun, but he didn't directly observe this happening. He observed phases which were evidence for it.
*   **D: Ku suka ka Venus:** Jeremiah Horrocks observed the transit of Venus in 1639, not Galileo in 1610.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, Nambu wa Amazon wu hlengeleta mati ya wona kwihi?","The correct answer is **C: Malwandle**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tiphesente ta 20 ta mati lama humaka eka minkova hinkwayo ta pulanete ya nghena elwandle ya huma eAmazon."" This directly translates to ""20 percent of the water from all rivers on the planet enters the ocean from the Amazon.""

Therefore, the Amazon River delivers a significant amount of water *to the ocean*.



"
I ku dzunisiwa kwihi loku nga nyikiwiki Nambu wa Amazon?,"The correct answer is **B: I nambu lowukulu swinene**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Amazon yi tlhela yi va nkova lowukulu hi ku anama misava hinkwayo..."" which translates to ""Amazon remains the largest river by collecting all the rivers...""  This directly implies that the Amazon is the largest river *in terms of volume/size*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I nambu wa vumbirhi lowukulu swinene:** While it *is* a large river, the text emphasizes it's the *largest*.
* **C: Nambu wo leha swinene:** The text mentions length (6,387 km), but the main point regarding its importance is its size and water collection.
* **D: Nambu wo anama swinene:** While it *collects* a lot of rivers, this doesn't directly answer what makes it special – it's the resulting *size* that matters.



"
I ntirho wihi lowi nga vuriwa eka ndzimana lowu nga qacha nhlayo leyitsongo ya vanhu va le Venezuela?,"The correct answer is **C: Oyili**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ntirho wa nkoka ka vanhu va le Venezuela i oyili..."" which translates to ""The most important job for Venezuelans is oil...""  While other jobs are mentioned (farming, factories), oil is specifically identified as the *most important* and the country is rich in it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vurimi (Farming):** The passage says only one-fifth work in agriculture.
* **B: Tifemeni (Factories):** The passage states factories employ people, but doesn't highlight them as the primary job.
* **D: Ntirho (Work/Jobs):** This is too general. The question asks for a *specific* job.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mintirho yihi eka leyi landzelaka leyi nga qacha nhlayo leyikulu ya vanhu va le Venezuela?","The correct answer is **B: Vurimi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mbirhi-xa-nharhu wa vanhu va le Venezuela lava tirhaka wu tirha mintirho ya xisekelo, kwalomu ka kotara yi tirha a tifemeni kambe n’we-xa-vuntlhanu wu tirha eka vurimi."" This translates to: ""Roughly half of the working population of Venezuela is employed in basic jobs, where in some areas they work in factories but one-fifth work in agriculture.""  

While oil is important to Venezuela's economy, the passage specifies that only a small percentage (one percent) are *employed* in the oil industry. Agriculture employs a much larger proportion – one-fifth of the workforce. Therefore, agriculture is the job that employs the largest proportion of Venezuelans, according to the text.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ku hlanganisiwa ku pfumelela tinyeleti leswaku ti endla yini?","The correct answer is **A: Ti endla ti elemente to tika** (To create heavier elements).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tinyeleti ti humesa rivoningo na ku hisa hikwalaho ka matimba lama endliwaka loko tiathomu ta hayidirojeni ti hlanganisiwa (kumbe ti endliwa xilo xin’we) **leswaku ti endla ti elemente to tika**."" (Stars release energy and shine because of the immense forces when hydrogen atoms are combined (or made into one thing) **to create heavier elements**.)

The passage directly links the combination of hydrogen atoms to the *creation of heavier elements*.  The other options are either actions stars *do* (research, release energy) or components of the process (hydrogen atoms) but not the *result* of the combination.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi xitirhiswa xa ku hlanganisiwa xi nga swi vumbaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Hayidirojene**.

Here's why:

The passage states that stars (tinyeleti) generate energy by *combining* (hlanganisiwa) **hydrogen** (hayidirojene) atoms. This process is what creates heavier elements and releases energy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tinyeleti (Stars):** Stars *use* the process, they aren't what the process uses.
* **C: Tiathomu (Atoms):** While atoms are involved, it's specifically hydrogen atoms that are the fuel.
* **D: Matimba (Energy):** Energy is the *result* of the process, not the input.



"
I tikhemikhali tihi leti nga endla mati?,"The correct answer is **D: Tiathomu timbirhi ta hayidirojini na athomu yin’we ya okisijini**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Khomphawundi ya mati yi endliwe hi ti athomu timbirhi ta hayidirojini na athomu yin’we ya okisijini."" (Water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom).



"
"Loko mati ma cinca xivumbeko, i yini lexi nga ta sala xi nga cincanga?","The correct answer is **A: Xivumbeko xa molekhuli** (The structure of the molecule).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hambileswi xivumbeko xa yona xale handle xo cinca, xivumbeko xa yona xale ndzeni a xi cinci.""  This translates to ""Although its overall structure changes, the structure of the molecule itself remains the same.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ntiko (Mass)** - The passage states mass *does* change (between states - gas, liquid, solid).
* **C: Xivumbeko xa le handle (Overall structure)** - The passage specifically says *this* changes.
* **D: Nayitirojeni ya xihalaki (Liquid nitrogen)** - This is an example mentioned in the text, not something that remains constant.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi a ku nga ri xiphiqo eka matiko ya khume nharhu loko ma tingeta ku veka milawu?","The correct answer is **B: Ku nga vi ni matimba endzeni ka Vandla ra Tiko**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vandla ra Tiko a ri nga ni matimba ya ku hakerisa swibalo, naswona, hikuva a ku nga ri ni rhavi ra hulumendhe wa tiko kumbe huvo ya vuavanyisi, ri titshege hi valawuri va mfumo...""  This directly translates to ""The National Assembly does not have the power to amend numbers, and because there is no government mandate or research, it relies on government lawyers, who are not coordinated, to ensure all laws are observed.""

This means the National Assembly (Vandla ra Tiko) *lacks the power* to change laws, making option B the most accurate answer to the question of what prevents the countries from making laws.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku lawuriwa ngopfu hi valawuri va mfumo (Being heavily regulated by government lawyers):** While the passage mentions reliance on lawyers, this is a *result* of the lack of power, not the reason the countries can't make laws themselves.
* **C: Ku lulamisiwa a ku lava mpfumelelo lowu ku pfumaleleneke (Not being able to achieve the desired success in standardization):** This refers to the overall goal of standardization, not a direct limitation on making laws.
* **D: Rhavi ra hulumendhe leri nga riki kona (The absence of a government mandate):**  This is *part* of the reason the National Assembly is ineffective, but the core issue is the lack of *power* itself.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi kombisaka hi ku kongoma xiyimo xa hulumendhe hi nkarhi wa Nyimpi ya Mafumelo Lamantshwa?","The correct answer is **C: Vayimeri va mfumo a va tshama va nga ri kona**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...matiko ma tekele hansi mfumo lowu nga le xikarhi hi laha vayimeri va wona a va tshama hakanyingi va nga ri kona.""  This directly translates to ""countries submitted to this central government where their representatives were not always present.""  This highlights a key problem with the governance during the time of the War of the Roses – lack of consistent representation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Swibalo swi sindzisiwe hi Vandla ra Tiko ni valawuri va mfumo** - While the passage mentions the National Assembly and government officials dealing with laws, it doesn't say they *created* numbers (swibalo). It refers to their inability to enforce numerical data due to a lack of official records.
* **B: Ku lulamisiwa ka Mintwanano a ku titshege hi vulawuri bya Vandla ra Tiko** - The passage states the opposite - the National Assembly couldn’t regulate agreements between countries.
* **D: Hulumendhe a yi ri ni swiaki swimbirhi** - The passage doesn't mention the government having two authorities. It points to issues with enforcement and representation.



"
Marito lama nga endzhaku ka Xihlambanyo xa Ntshunxeko ma tsariwe njhani?,"The correct answer is **C: Ma ganamile**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tsalwa leri ri vonakala ehansi ka papila, ri ganamile."" which translates to ""The writing that appears under the document is signed."" This directly means the words were signed, or ""ganamile"" in Tsonga.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hi marito lamakulu** - The passage doesn't mention large writing.
*   **B: Hi khodi** - The passage doesn't mention a code.
*   **D: Hi marito lamatsongo** - The passage doesn't mention small writing.



"
Singapore yi tiviwa ngopfu hi yini eka leswi landzelaka?,"The correct answer is **D: Vutshila** (Gardens).

Here's why:

The passage directly states that the Singapore Botanic Gardens are ""renowned for harboring the Doroba ra Ntanga"" and that a flower from these gardens (Vanda Miss Joaquim) became the national flower. This highlights the importance of the gardens (vutshila) to Singapore's identity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Doroba ya rihlaza** (Green City) - While Singapore *is* a green city, the passage specifically focuses on the gardens, not the city's overall greenery.
*   **B: Ku khandziya tintshava** (Harboring Enemies) - This is irrelevant to the passage.
*   **C: Mintlangu ya le handle** (Foreign Languages) - This is also irrelevant to the passage.



"
I yini Vanda Miss Joaquim?,"The correct answer is **B: Xiluva**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hi 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, orchid leyi pfanganisiweke, yi hlawuriwile leswaku yi va **xiluva xa tiko**."" (In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, a hybrid orchid, was declared the **national flower**.)

Therefore, Vanda Miss Joaquim is a flower.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i xiyimo xihi xa xihondzo ta le Giza lexi a xi nga ta va lexi hlamarisaka eka Vafumi lavantshwa va Vaegipta?","The correct answer is **A: Malembe ya xona (Its age)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...leswi hinkarhi wolowo a swi ri ni magidi ya malembe."" (All of this was associated with thousands of years).  It specifically links the pyramids (xihondzo ta le Giza) to the long lifespans/ages associated with the pharaohs who built them. The pharaohs were remembered *because* of how long those structures lasted, connecting their legacy to the pyramids' age.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku tirhisiwa ka ribye (Use of skill):** While skill was involved, the passage doesn't directly connect the pyramids to *being remembered for* the skill used in their construction.
* **C: Vukulu bya xona (Its size):** Size is mentioned, but not as the primary reason the pharaohs were remembered.
* **D: Ku endliwa ka xona (Its construction):**  Similar to skill, construction is a *how* it happened, not *why* the pharaohs were remembered in relation to it.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, swihari leswi dyaka swimilana ntsena swi suka kwihi ku ya lava mpfula?","The correct answer is **C: A switsungeni swa le n’walungwini**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kutani ti tlhelela endzhaku a n’walungwini ku ya evupela-dyambu..."" which translates to ""But they move from the south of the plains to the north to find water."" This directly answers the question of where the wildebeest come from to look for water.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, hi le ka ndhawu yihi laha swihari leswi dyaka swimilana swi sukaka kwalomu ka April?","The correct answer is **C: Nambu wa Mara**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ti tlhela ti pela Nambu wa Mara, endzhaku ka mpfula hi April."" (They then cross the Mara River in April). This directly links the wildebeest crossing to Nambu wa Mara in April.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Xifundzha xa Serengeti:** The text mentions the Serengeti as a larger region, but doesn't say the crossing *happens* within it in April.
*   **B: A switsungeni swa le n’walungwini:** This refers to where they *begin* their journey, not where they cross the river in April.
*   **D: Ntanga wa Maasai Mara wa leswi nga Sirheleriwa:** This is a part of the larger area, but the text specifically points to Nambu wa Mara.



"
Vutirheli bya Sealion a ku ri ku hlaseriwa ka tiko rihi?,"The correct answer is **B: E Britain**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Jarimani yi thye nhlaselo lowu yi vito ra khodi leri nge “Vutirheli bya Sealion”. Matlhari yo tala ya Mavuthu ya Britain..."" which translates to ""Germany planned an attack codenamed “Operation Sealion”. The initial targets of the British Armed Forces...""  This clearly indicates the operation was intended to attack Britain.



"
Jarimani yi ku vitane yini ku hlaseriwa ka Britain?,"The correct answer is **B: Vutirheli bya Sealion**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jarimani yi thye nhlaselo lowu yi vito ra khodi leri nge “Vutirheli bya Sealion”."" (Germany planned an attack codenamed ""Operation Sealion"").  This directly answers the question of what Germany called its planned invasion of Britain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dunkirk:** Dunkirk was a *retreat* of Allied forces, not the name of the German invasion plan.
*   **C: Kriegsmarine:** This refers to the German Navy, and while important, it's not the *name* of the invasion.
*   **D: Vuthu ra le Matini ra le Vuhosini:** This is the German Navy (same as Kriegsmarine) and doesn't represent the invasion's codename.



"
I yini leyi nga vuriwiki tanihi goza ra nkoka eka kungu ra Italiya ra ku teka matiko ya le Afrika?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku ta lava ndhawu ya ku humesa mavuthu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ku teka matiko wolawo, a va ta lava ndhawu ya ku humesa mavuthu, leswaku mavuthu a kota ku tluta a tsemakanye Lwandle ra Mediteraniya ni ku hlasela Afrika."" This directly links taking African countries to the need for naval bases to control the Mediterranean Sea and attack Africa.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku susa swikepe swa le Egipta** - While mentioned, this is a *method* used to achieve the larger goal, not the goal itself.
*   **B: Ku aka swikepe leswi engetelekeke** - The passage states their ships weren't powerful enough to make a difference, so building more wasn't the primary motivation.
*   **D: Ku herisa tintsindza ta masocha ya le Britain** - Similar to A, this is a tactic, not the main reason for wanting to take African countries.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini lexi a xi tekiwa tanihi xikongomelo-nkulu xa Italiya hi nyimpi?","The correct answer is **A: Ku teka matiko ya le Afrika**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Xikongomelo lexikulu xa Italiya a ku ri matiko ya le Afrika."" (The main goal of Italy was the countries of Africa). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the passage mentions building up military and naval power, it states this is *in order* to take African countries, not the main goal itself.
* **C & D:** These are tactics *related* to the overall goal of controlling Africa, but not the main goal itself. They are things Italy wanted to *do* to achieve its goal.



"
I mani la nga endla xinghana ni vahlaseri?,"The correct answer is **D: Mafurwa lama nga Ntshunxeka (Free French)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hi mavhiki mambirhi ntsena Maamerika ni mavuthu ya Mafurwa lama nga Ntshunxeka va ntshunxe edzongeni wa Furwa naswona a va kongome eka Jarimani.""  This directly translates to ""After two weeks, Americans and forces of the Free French stormed the beaches of Furwa and defeated the Germans.""

Therefore, the Free French fought *alongside* the Allies against the Germans.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Majarimani (Germans):** The passage says the Free French *fought against* the Germans, not *with* them.
*   **B: Mafurwa ya le Vichy (Vichy French):** The passage specifically mentions they were distinct from the Free French and collaborated with the Germans.
*   **C: Maamerika (Americans):** While the Americans participated in the invasion, the question asks who fought *with* the invaders, and the Free French are specifically mentioned as allies in the fighting.



"
I va mani lava a va katseka eka Vutirheli bya Dragoon?,"The correct answer is **A: Maamerika ni Mafurwa lama nga Ntshunxeka**.

The text specifically states: ""Hi ti 15 August 1940, ti Allies ti hlasele edzongeni wa Furwa, nhlaselo u vitaniwe “Vutirheli bya Dragoon” Hi mavhiki mambirhi ntsena **Maamerika ni mavuthu ya Mafurwa lama nga Ntshunxeka** va ntshunxe edzongeni wa Furwa naswona a va kongome eka Jarimani."" 

This directly identifies the Americans and the Free French forces as participants in Operation Dragoon.



"
I ku hluvuka ka thekinoloji yihi loku nga vangela leswaku swikepe swa le hansi ka mati swi sungula ku famba ehansi ka mati?,"The correct answer is **D: Radar**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Loko nyimpi yi sungula hi xitalo a swi famba ehenhla ka lwandle, kambe loko **radar** yi sungula ku hluvuka naswona yi kongoma ngopfu swikepe swa le hansi ka mati swi boheke ku nghena ehansi ka mati ku papalata ku voniwa.""

This directly links the development of radar to the submarines (swikepe swa le hansi ka mati) beginning to submerge to avoid detection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: U-Boats:** U-Boats were *types* of submarines, not the technology that caused them to submerge.
*   **B: Vukule bya ku duvula:** (Development of diving) While submarines need to be able to dive, the passage doesn't say this development *caused* them to start diving more frequently.
*   **C: Ku tluta:** (To float/move) This is a general action and doesn't explain why they began submerging.



"
"Hi nkarhi wa ku swi tirhisa ra ku sungula, swikepe swa le hansi ka mati a swi ri ni swipimelo swa vukule eka xiphemu xihi?","The correct answer is **A: Ku tluta**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Majarimani a va swi kota **kahle ku tluta** ni ku fambisa swikepe swa vona swa le hansi ka mati.""  This translates to ""Germans were able to **effectively sink** and operate their submarines.""

Therefore, the initial use of submarines was most impactful in their ability to *sink* (tluta) ships.  The other options don't align with the passage's focus on their destructive capability.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani la nga lwisana ni ntwanano? ","The correct answer is **D: Va Soviet**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Soviet Union (Red Army) invaded Belarus and Ukraine, *breaking* the Riga Peace Treaty, Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other agreements. This means they were acting *against* the treaties – essentially, they were the ones in opposition to the agreements (ntwanano).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Va le Poland:** Poland was being invaded, not opposing treaties.
*   **B: Va le Romania:** Romania is mentioned as having a separate agreement but isn’t described as being in conflict with any agreements.
*   **C: Va le Ukraine:** Ukraine was being invaded by the Soviet Union, not opposing treaties themselves.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga endliwanga hi Red Army?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku hlengeleta kambe xisekelo lexi tiyeke** (To invade but with a justifiable basis).

Here's why:

The passage states the Soviet Union justified their invasion with a ""justifiable basis"" (xisekelo lexi tiyeke). However, the passage *also* explicitly says they invaded (ku nghena ni ku hlasela).  Options A, B, and D are all things the Red Army *did* do, according to the text. Only option C describes something they claimed to be doing *while* justifying it.



"
Ku endleke yini hi Munjiniyarankulu wa Vukhume wa Vuthu wa Muntariyana?,"The correct answer is **C: U tekiwile hi va le Britain**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...maBurithani ma teke Munjiniyarankulu wa Vukhume wa Vuthu wa Muntariyana, Mujenerala Lastucci.""  This translates to ""...the British took the Commander of the 11th Hussar Regiment of Britain, General Lastucci.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: U tekiwile a Fort Capuzzo** - He was *taken by* the British *at* Fort Capuzzo, not the other way around.
*   **B: U dlayiwile a Tobruk** - Marshal Balbo was killed at Tobruk, not General Lastucci.
*   **D: U dlayiwile hi ndzilo wa xinghana** - The passage doesn't mention anything about being killed by friendly fire.



"
Italo Balbo u dlayiwe kwihi?,"The correct answer is **D: E Tobruk**.

The text states: ""Hi June 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, Mulawurijenerala wa Libya tlhelo loyi a tekiwa a ri mudyandzhaka wa Mussolini, u dlayiwile hi ku baleseriwa hi xihoxo loko a fika e**Tobruk**."" 

This directly translates to: ""On June 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, the commander of Libya who was under Mussolini, was killed by being shot down when he arrived at **Tobruk**.""



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i endlelo rihi eka lama landzelaka leri nga xiphemu xa nkoka eka ku anakanyisisa ka Xitibet?","The correct answer is **C: Ku languta hi mahlo ya mianakanyo swikwembu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ntsindza wa ku anakanyisisa ka Xitibet i Yoga ya Swikwebu. Hi ku languta hi mahlo ya mianakanyo swikwembu swo hambana hambana mintila ya matimba ya basisiwa, ti chakra ti sungula ku tirha naswona ku endleka ku xalamukela ku voningeriwa."" This directly links gazing at objects (swikwembu) as a key component of Tibetan meditation (ku anakanyisisa).

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

*   **A: Ku titoloveta vutiolori byo hefumula:** While breathing exercises are *part* of Kundalini Yoga (mentioned generally), the passage specifically highlights gazing as the core of Tibetan meditation.
*   **B: Ku phindha-phindha marito yo karhi ya vukhongeri:** Mantras are part of the practice, but not the central focus of the Tibetan meditation described.
*   **D: Ku dyondza mayimelo ya yoga:** Yoga postures are mentioned as part of Kundalini Yoga, but again, the passage is focused on *Tibetan* meditation and specifically identifies gazing as its defining feature.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ti chakra ti sungula ku tirha njhani eka ntsindza wa ku anakanyisisa ka Xitibet?","The correct answer is **B: Hi ku languta hi mahlo ya mianakanyo swikwembu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hi ku languta hi mahlo ya mianakanyo swikwembu swo hambana hambana mintila ya matimba ya basisiwa, ti chakra ti sungula ku tirha naswona ku endleka ku xalamukela ku voningeriwa."" This directly links the activation of chakras to gazing at different mandalas (swikwembu) with focused intention.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hi mayimelo ya yoga yo hambana-hambana** - While yoga postures are mentioned as part of the overall practice, they aren't specifically stated as *how* the chakras begin to work.
*   **C: Ku phindha-phindha marito yo karhi ya vukhongeri** - Mantras are part of the practice, but not the direct trigger for chakra activation described in the text.
*   **D: Ku titoloveta vutiolori byo hefumula** - Breathing exercises are also part of the practice, but not the specific mechanism for initiating chakra function.



"
I mani loyi a nga endla vuyimbeleri bya ku tinyiketela hi nkarhi wa nongonoko?,"The correct answer is **A: Sanju Sharma**.

The text states: ""Evusikwini lebyi ku sungule muyimbeleri **Sanju Sharma**, ku landzela Jai Shankar Choudharry."" (This program was started by singer **Sanju Sharma**, followed by Jai Shankar Choudharry.)  It specifically says Sanju Sharma started the devotional singing.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani loyi a nga endla vuyimbeleri bya ku tinyiketela hi nkarhi wa ku nyiketela swakudya?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tipuleyiti ta 108 ta Chhappan Bhog (hi xi Hindu, hi swilo swa 58 swa ku hambana hambana leswi dyiwaka, swilo swa ku fana na malekere, mihandzu, timanga,swakudya leswi nyikeriwaka eka swikwembu) a swi nyikiwa Baba Shyam. Lakkha Singh u endle chhappan bhog bhajan na yena.""

This directly translates to: ""108 plates of Chhappan Bhog were offered to Baba Shyam. Lakkha Singh sang the Chhappan Bhog bhajan with him.""  Therefore, Lakkha Singh performed the devotional singing during the offering of food.



"
A ku ri yini ku tlangela ka vumbirhi ku ya eka ko hetelela bya nimadyambu?,"The correct answer is **A: Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina na Haris Alexiou**.

Here's why:

The question asks what happens *between* the beginning and the end of the performance. The text states: ""Ku hetelela, ntlawa wo cina wale Turkey Fire of Anatolia u cine nongonoko “Troy”."" (To conclude, the Turkish dance troupe Fire of Anatolia performed the show ""Troy"").  *Before* that, it mentions Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina, and Haris Alexiou performing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fire of Anatolia** - This is the *ending* of the performance, not something that happens during the middle.
* **C: Whirling Dervishes** - They appear earlier in the performance, not specifically near the end.
* **D: Fatih Erkoç na Müslüm Gürses** - They are mentioned as part of the orchestral accompaniment, not as performers that transition towards the finale.



"
Alessandro Safina i wa rixaka rihi?,"The correct answer is **D: Muntariyani**.

The text states: ""Alessandro Safina wa Muntariyani loyi a yimbelelaka thena na muyimbeleri wa Mugriki Haris Alexiou."" This directly translates to ""Alessandro Safina of Italy who performed with Greek singer Haris Alexiou."" 

Therefore, Alessandro Safina is from Italy (Muntariyani).



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki ntiyiso?","The correct answer is **C: Vakhandziyi va nyikiwe mati**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Vakhandziyi a va nyikiwe mati loko va ha yimile eka ku hisa ka 90(F)-wa tidigiri."" (Visitors were given water when it was hot at 90 degrees.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A ku ri ni ndzilo le Santa Clara** - While the quote mentions Santa Clara, it doesn't *state* there *is* a park there, only that a day of heat occurred there.
* **B: Vanhu a va phasekeke eka roller coaster** - The passage says people *do* ride roller coasters, it just mentions they don't fall off.
* **D: Swi teke timinete ta 60 ku hemesa munhu wun’we eka xo khandziya** - The passage states it takes *an hour* (60 minutes) to rescue someone, making this a true statement, but not the one being asked about regarding *untrue* information.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani loyi a nga vulavula hi mpimo wa ku hisa lowu nga tiyiselelekiki?","The correct answer is **B: Mukaputeni wa ndzilo (Captain of the park)**.

Here's why:

The passage states, “Mukaputeni wa ndzilo Scott Kouns u te…” (Captain of the park Scott Kouns said...). He is the one quoted as speaking about the temperature and its impact on the roller coaster.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mulawuri wa xo khandziya (Ride operator):** The passage doesn't mention the ride operator commenting on the temperature.
*   **C: Vakhandziyi (Visitors):** While visitors *experience* the temperature, the passage doesn't say they commented on it.
*   **D: Murhangeri wa maphorisa (Police officer):** A police officer isn’t relevant to a temperature affecting a roller coaster.



"
A ku ri kwihi laha ku nga na ku tsemeka ka gezi hikwalaho ka xiendlakalo xa tsunami?,"The correct answer is **A: E Tonga**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...gezi ri tsemekile nkarhinyana, leswi hi xiviko swi siveleke valawuri va le Tonga ku amukela ku humesiwa ka xilemukiso xa tsunami hi PTWC.""  This translates to ""...the fleet is mobilized slightly, which is to allow authorities in Tonga to accept the tsunami warning from PTWC.""

This directly indicates that the fleet mobilization is happening *in Tonga* due to the potential tsunami event.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, Tonga yi khumbeke njhani hi ku tsemeka ka gezi?","The correct answer is **D: Valawuri va tsandzekile ku kuma swilemukiso leswi faneleka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...leswi hi xiviko swi siveleke valawuri va le Tonga ku amukela ku humesiwa ka xilemukiso xa tsunami hi PTWC."" This translates to ""...which led to Tonga's authorities being prepared to receive a tsunami warning from PTWC.""  

This means the delay in the buoy's operation allowed authorities time to prepare for a potential tsunami warning.  The other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage states there *isn't* any observation detected.
* **B:** The passage says authorities *are* preparing, not ignoring warnings.
* **C:** The passage mentions ocean measurements are being made, but doesn't state they are affected by the delay.



"
Hi rini laha maphorisa ma nga kota ku tirhisa swibalesa swo pima rivilo ra timovha leswaku va kuma rivilo ra Jonny Reid ra ku chayela?,"The correct answer is **A: Loko a chayela hi 160km/h**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""maphorisa ma swi kotile ku pima rivilo ra Nkul Reid loko a hunguta rivilo ri fika eka 160km/h."" This directly translates to ""police were able to measure Jonny Reid's speed when he reduced the speed to 160km/h"". 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hi nkarhi wa yena wa nkombo ehenhla ka buloho:** While he drove during this time, the passage doesn't say the police measured his speed *during* the entire run, only when he slowed down.
* **C: Loko a chayela ku tlula 160km/h:** The police measured his speed *at* 160km/h, not exceeding it.
* **D: Hi nkarhi wa yena wa ku sungula ehenhla ka buloho:**  The passage doesn't mention when the police started measuring.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ha yini a swi tikela maphorisa ya le New Zealand ku pima rivilo ra Jonny Reid?","The correct answer is **A: A chayela ehansi ka 160km/h**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...maphorisa ma karhatekile ku tirhisa swibalesa swa swona swa rivilo ko pima rivilo ra Nkul Reid hikwalaho ka leswi Black Beauty a yi fambela ehansi, nkarhi wun’we ntsena laha maphorisa ma swi kotile ku pima rivilo ra Nkul Reid loko a hunguta rivilo ri fika eka 160km/h."" This directly translates to ""police were forced to use their speed cameras to measure Reid's speed because Black Beauty was going down, and at one point the police managed to measure Reid's speed when he reduced the speed to 160km/h.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Movha a yi ri ehansi ngopfu** - The text doesn't say the car was *too* slow.
*   **C: U chayele ehenhla ka buloho minkarhi ya nkombo ntsena** - While he did speed, this isn't the direct reason the police measured his speed. It's the speed itself that prompted the measurement.
*   **D: The Auckland Harbour Bridge i ya khale** - The age of the bridge is irrelevant to why the police measured his speed.



"
Ku tsekatseka ka misava ku endleke kwihi mayelana ni Butte?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 wa timayili edzongeni** (40 miles west).

The text states: ""Ku tsekatseka loku ka misava ku endleke kwalomu ka 65 wa tikhilomitara (40 wa timayili) edzongeni wa Butte.""  This directly translates to ""This earthquake occurred 65 kilometers (40 miles) west of Butte.""
"
I yini lexi nga humelela hi nkarhi wa hasahasa le Abu Ghraib?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku khomiwa ku biha ka vakhotsiwa** (Torture of prisoners).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that prisoners at Abu Ghraib were subjected to torture during the period of unrest. The other options are related to the context, but don't directly answer *what* happened during that time.

* **B: Nsivelo wa ku huma** (Escape attempts) - While likely happening, it isn't the primary focus of the passage.
* **C: Mavuthu ya US ma lawule ndhawu** (US forces controlled the area) - This is background information, not the event itself.
* **D: Khotso ri hisiwile hi ndzilo** (Peace was disturbed violently) - This describes the general situation, not the specific abuse.



"
Ha yini jele ra Iraqi ri ve ni ndhuma? ,"The correct answer is **D: Ku tshuburiwa ka ku khomiwa ku biha ka vakhotsiwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states the prison was notorious ""because prisoners were alleged to have been tortured while under the control of US forces."" This directly links the notoriety to the allegations of torture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ri hisiwile hi ndzilo:** While true, this doesn't explain *why* it was notorious.
* **B: Mavuthu ya US ma lawule ndhawu:** This is a fact mentioned in the passage, but not the *reason* for the prison’s bad reputation.
* **C: A ku ri ni hasahasa yo tala:** The passage mentions hardship, but focuses specifically on the torture allegations.



"
I muxaka muni wa xiendlakalo lowu a wu ta khomiwa a War Memorial Stadium xa Maui?,"The correct answer is **C: Khonsati**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Bendhe yi khanserile nkombiso le War Memorial Stadium..."" (The band cancelled a show at War Memorial Stadium...).  ""Nkombiso"" translates to ""show"" or ""performance"", and given the context of a band, this points to a concert.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nkombiso wa masalamusi** - While ""nkombiso"" is in this option, ""masalamusi"" means mourning, and the passage doesn't suggest a memorial event.
*   **B: Ntlangu wa bolo ya milenge** - This translates to a fundraising cake competition, which doesn’t fit the context of a band cancelling an event.
*   **D: Xiendlakalo xa ku hlengeleta mali** - This translates to a fundraising event, which isn’t indicated in the text.



"
I mani a ku heteleleni la nga nyikela nhlamuselo malunghana ni ku khanseriwa ka xiendlakalo?,"The correct answer is **A: Bendhe**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""P: **Bendhe** yi khanserile nkombiso le War Memorial Stadium..."" (Bendhe cancelled a show at War Memorial Stadium...). The question asks who cancelled the event, and the passage directly identifies ""Bendhe"" as the one who did.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Khampani ya vufambisi (The promotion company):** While HK Management Inc. is involved, the passage states *Bendhe* cancelled the show. The promotion company didn’t cancel it, they were just contacted for a reason.
*   **C: N’wini wa War Memorial Stadium (Owner of War Memorial Stadium):** The passage doesn't mention the stadium owner cancelling anything.
*   **D: Vaseketeri (Spectators):** Spectators didn't cancel the event; it was cancelled *for* them.



"
I va mani lava vaaki vo hlayanyana va le Bishkek a va va sola hi ku phangiwa ka nhundzu eswitolo?,"The correct answer is **C: Lava vakombisaka ku vilela**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vaaki vo hlayanyana va le Bishkek va sola vanhu lava kombisaka ku vilela lava humaka edzongeni hikwalaho ka ku tshoviwa loku ka nawu.""  This directly translates to ""The residents of Bishkek blame people who incite riots coming from the squares for the fear caused by this event.""

Therefore, the residents are blaming those inciting riots for the looting.



"
I mani la nga sola lava vakombisaka ku vilela lava humaka edzongeni hi ku phangiwa ka nhundzu eswitolo?,"The correct answer is **A: Vaaki va Bishkek**.

The text states: ""Vaaki vo hlayanyana va le Bishkek va sola vanhu lava kombisaka ku vilela lava humaka edzongeni hikwalaho ka ku tshoviwa loku ka nawu."" This directly translates to ""The residents of Bishkek accuse people who incite riots from the outside due to the fear caused by the events.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maphorisa (Police):** The text doesn't say the police are making accusations. It states they were *not* present during the looting.
* **C: Lava vangaka hasahasa (Those who caused the chaos):** They are being accused *of* causing the chaos, not doing the accusing.
* **D: Mintlawa ya vanhu (Crowds of people):** While the crowds participated in the looting, the text specifies the *residents* are making the accusation about outside agitators.



"
Ring u vone rini ku tlakuka ka minxavo?,"The correct answer is **A: Endzhaku ka loko a humelerile eka nongonoko wa Shark Tank**.

The passage states: ""minxavo yi tlakukile hi 2013 endzhaku ka loko a humelerile eka nongonoko wa Shark Tank..."" which directly translates to ""problems arose in 2013 after he pitched on Shark Tank...""



"
Jamie Siminoff o teke rini xiboho xa ku sungula Ring?,"The correct answer is **A: Endzhaku ka ku vona leswaku bele rakwe ra le nyangweni a ri nga twali**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Enkarhini lowu bele rakwe ra le nyangweni a ri nga twali kahle loko a ri exitolo lexi a xi ri agarajini yakwe."" (He realized his doorbell didn't work well when it was in his garage.) This directly led to him starting the company.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** While the *Shark Tank* experience was a challenge, it wasn't the initial spark for the idea.
*   **C:** He didn't start the company because he *found* investors, but because of a personal need.
*   **D:** QVC was a later success, not the reason he began the company.



"
Xiphemu xin’wana ni xin’wana xa Reading Rainbow a xi bumabumela vana yini?,"The correct answer is **D: Tibuku**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nongonoko wun’wana ni wun’wana a wu thlela wu bumabumela tibuku tin’wana leti vana va nga ti langutaka loko va ya eka tilayiburari ta vona."" This directly translates to ""Each segment would feature books that children might check out at the library.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Minongonoko ya thelevhixini** - The passage talks about *Reading Rainbow* being a television program, but it doesn't say each segment features other TV shows.
*   **B: Tilayiburari ta le ndhawini** - While the passage mentions libraries, it doesn’t state that each segment features local libraries.
*   **C: Tinhloko-mhaka** - While segments explore themes, they do so *through* books, not by featuring the themes themselves.



"
I yini lexi nga va xi endle leswaku ku hela ntlhandlamano wa xitori xa Reading Rainbow?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku hela ka minyikelo** (The end of funding).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Van’wana va tshemba, ku katsa na John Grant, leswaku ku hela ka minyikelo ni ku cinca eka minongonoko ya thelevhixini ya ku dyondzisa filosofi ku hoxe xandla eka ku hela ka ntlhandlamano wa xitori.""  This directly translates to ""Some believe, including John Grant, that the end of funding and changes to television educational philosophies contributed to the end of the story-telling tradition.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku nga kumi masagwati ya Emmy** (Not having Emmy awards) - The passage mentions Emmy awards, but doesn't link them to the end of the show.
* **C: Vonelo ra John Grant** (John Grant's opinion) - While John Grant is mentioned, the passage states it's a belief *including* his, not solely his opinion that caused the ending.
* **D: Ku humelela ka Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood** (The success of Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood) - The passage mentions Sesame Street and Rogers' Neighborhood as shows the program was compared to, but doesn't say their success led to Reading Rainbow's end.



"
I nhlamuselo yihi eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga vuriwanga hi vatirhelamfumo va Amsterdam na muziyamu malunghana ni nsinya?,"The correct answer is **A: A wu ri ekhombyeni ro va wu wa** (It is not in their possession).

Here's why:

The passage states that the officials and the museum confirmed the tree *was not* in their possession, despite being reported stolen. This is the core of their statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Wu fanele wu ponisiwa** (It should be reported) - The passage says it *was* reported stolen, not that it *should* be.
* **C: Wu hlaseriwe hi mfurhe** (It was cut down) - This is a fact *about* the tree, but not the *statement* made by the officials.
* **D: Wu nga va ni khombo eka rihanyo ra vanhu** (It does not have significance for people) - The passage actually implies the opposite - the tree *does* have significance, which is why its theft was reported and investigated.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndhuna ya vukamberi ya RSPCA, vukamberi byi fanele byi tirha eka yini eka leswi landzelaka?","The correct answer is **A: Ti khamera ta CCTV**.

Here's why:

The passage states David O'Shannessy believes ""ku tlhomiwa tihlo ni ku kambisisiwa ka tindhawu to xavisa nyama ni ku dlaya swihari swi fanele swi va ntolovelo eAustralia. CCTV a yi ta endla leswaku vanhu lava tirhaka hi swiharhi va leswaku rihanyo ni vuhlayiseki bya swona i bya nkoka swinene.” This directly translates to him believing that installing CCTV cameras is the solution to ensure those working with animals are accountable and prioritize animal welfare.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: U’nwana ni un’wana la tirhaka hi swiharhi:** While the cameras *impact* those working with animals, the focus is on the cameras themselves as the tool for oversight.
*   **C: Ku tlhomiwa tihlo:** This is a problem the CCTV cameras are meant to address, not what the oversight should focus on.
*   **D: Tindhawu leti xavisaka nyama ni ku dlaya swiharhi:** These are the *locations* where the cameras would be, but not the focus of the oversight itself.



"
"Hi ku hi ndzimana, i yini leswi nga pfuna ku tiyisa nkoka wa vuhlayiseki bya swihari eka vatirhi va tindhawu leti xavisaka nyama ni ku dlaya swiharhi va le Australia?","The correct answer is **A: Ku tlhomiwa ka ti khamera ta CCTV**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that David O'Shannessy believes CCTV cameras ""will ensure those working with animals understand that their welfare is paramount."" The entire argument centers around the implementation of CCTV to improve animal welfare and hold workers accountable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Minhlangano leyi bohaka na RSPCA:** While the RSPCA is advocating for this, the *cameras themselves* are the mechanism for change.
* **C: Vukamberi bya nkarhi ni nkarhi bya tindhawu leti xavisaka nyama ni ku dlaya swiharhi:**  The passage doesn't say frequent inspections are the key, but rather *monitoring* through cameras.
* **D: Vulawuri lebyi humaka a ABC:**  ABC is just reporting the news; they aren't the solution to improving animal welfare.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini ntirho wa munhu la nga khomiwa?","The correct answer is **B: Mutsari wa mahungu wa Minneapolis Star-Tribune**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""munhu lo ativaka ndzavisiso u byele Star-Tribune xa le Minneapolis..."" This translates to ""the person conducting the investigation spoke to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune..."".  This clearly identifies the person as a reporter/writer for the Star-Tribune.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Xichudeni (Shooter)** - The passage refers to the shooter (Jeff Weise) separately. This person is investigating the shooting, not *being* the shooter.
*   **C: Mtshamaxitulo xa Tribal (Tribal Chairman)** - The passage mentions Floyd Jourdain *is* the Tribal Chairman, but the person being discussed is not him. It’s his son, Louis Jourdain.
*   **D: Mulawuri e Red Lake (Police Officer in Red Lake)** - The passage states police are trying to confirm what happened, but doesn't identify *this* person as a police officer.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, loko ka ha hangalaka mahungu hi ku khomiwa kun’wana, a ku lahliwa vanhu va ngani lava duvuriweke?","The correct answer is **B: Va nharhu**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""...tanihi leswi ku lahliwaka Jeff Weise ni **vanharhu** lava duvuriweke.""  This directly translates to ""...as well as **several people** who were killed.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Un’we (One)** - The passage says *several* people, not just one.
*   **C: Va kaye (Many)** - While ""many"" isn't wrong, ""vanharhu"" (several) is the more precise term used *in the text*.
*   **D: Va mune (Few)** - ""Few"" implies a small number, while the context suggests more than just a few.



"
"Eka nhlamulo ya xitereko, i tiko rihi leri nga si ya emahlweni na ntwanano wa ACTA lowu nga sayiniwa?","The correct answer is **B: E Poland**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Eka n’wheti leyi nga hundza, kuve na ku tereka lokukulu ePoland loko tiko leri ri sayine ACTA, leswi swi endle leswaku hulumende yale Poland yi teka xiboho xa ku nga wu sayini sweswi ntwanano."" 

This directly translates to: ""This month, there will be a large protest in Poland if the country signs ACTA, which caused the Polish government to hesitate to sign the agreement.""  This indicates Poland was on the verge of signing but *didn't* due to protests, making it the country most closely associated with resisting the ACTA agreement in the text.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E Jarimani** - Germany is mentioned for protests in general, but not specifically in relation to ACTA.
*   **C: E Scotland** - Scotland is only mentioned as a location where protests also occurred, not as a country directly debating ACTA.
*   **D: E Lithuania** - Lithuania is mentioned as a location with protests, but not as a country resisting signing ACTA."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i matiko mahi eka lama landzelaka lama nga hlawula ku teka nkarhi ku nghenelela ACTA?","The correct answer is **D: E Latvia**.

The text states: ""Latvia na Slovakia havumbirhi ti teke nkarhi ku nghenelela ACTA."" (Latvia and Slovakia both took time to consider ACTA).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E Estonia** - The text mentions Estonia as a place where protests occurred, not as a country that delayed ratification.
*   **B: E Lithuania** - Similar to Estonia, Lithuania is mentioned as a protest location.
*   **C: E Scotland** - Scotland is a region within the UK, and the text doesn't state it delayed ACTA ratification.



"
I vanhu vangani lava nga vaviseka hikwalaho ka xiendlakalo xa ti iPod leti nga hisa ku tlula mpimo?,"The correct answer is **D: 34**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""METI yi tivise leswaku Apple a yi yi tivise hi 34 wa switirhisiwa leswi engetelekeke leswi a swi hisa ku tlula mpimo..."" This directly translates to ""METI announced that Apple did not report 34 excess components that exceed the measurement...""  Therefore, 34 people (or rather, 34 instances of exceeding measurements) were affected.



"
I mani la nga vula leswaku swiendlakalo swa ku hisa ku tlula mpimo i leswi-nga riki swa vutiyimiseri?,"The correct answer is **D: Apple**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""khámphani yi swi vuleke “leswi-nga riki swa vutiyimiseri”."" which translates to ""the company stated 'it is not a quality problem'"".  The passage clearly identifies *Apple* as the company that made this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: METI** - METI is the one *receiving* the explanation, not *giving* it.
*   **B: Vini va ti iPod lava nga katseka** - The passage mentions people who were affected, but they didn't make the statement.
*   **C: Ndzawulo wa ndzilo le Japani** - This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
"Eka bulo ra yena, Steve Jobs u te Apple yi ta sungula vuntshwa yini?","The correct answer is **B: Selifoni**.

Here's why:

The passage states Steve Jobs announced, ""Today Apple will reinvent the phone, today we will change everything.""  He was talking about a new type of **phone** (selifoni in Xitsonga).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Matimu (things)** - Too broad. He wasn't just talking about ""things"" in general.
*   **C: Khamphani (company)** - He was talking about what the company *would create*, not the company itself.
*   **D: Thekinoloji (technology)** - While the phone used technology, the announcement specifically focused on the *phone* itself, not technology in a general sense.



"
Xikongomelo xa Steve Jobs xa bulo ra tiwara timbirhi a ku ri yini?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku kombisa selifoni leyintshwa** (To show a new cellphone).

Here's why:

The text (P) explicitly states Steve Jobs announced, """"Namuntlha Apple yi ta sungula vuntshwa selifoni, Hi ta endla matimu namuntlha"""" which translates to """"Today Apple will reveal a new cellphone, We will change things today."""" This directly indicates his purpose was to unveil a new phone – the iPhone.



"
I yini leswi Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner a nga swi tivisa eka Thiyetara ya Argentina?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku nghenela ku hlawuriwa ku va muungameri**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Man. Kirchner u tivisile xikongomelo xakwe xa ku yimela ku langiwa ku va muungameri eka Thiyetara ya Argentina..."" This directly translates to ""Ms. Kirchner announced her intention to run for the position of senator in the Teatro Argentina..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Xikongomelo xa yena xa ku va Sinethara** - While she *was* a senator, the passage focuses on her *announcing her candidacy* for the position, not the fact that she held it previously.
* **C: Tsima rakwe ra nhlawulo wa xifundzha wa Buenos Aires** - The passage mentions this theater was used for her 2005 campaign, but it wasn't *what* she announced.
* **D: Kungu ra yena ra ku tshika ku va murhanga wa sweswi** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
Hi le kwihi laha Cristina Fernandes a nga tivisa xikongomelo xa yena xa ku langiwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Eka Thiyetara ya Argentina leyi nga timayili ta 31 ku suka Buenos Aires**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Man. Kirchner u tivisile xikongomelo xakwe xa ku yimela ku langiwa ku va muungameri eka Thiyetara ya Argentina, ndhawu yona leyi a yi tirhiseleke ku sungula tsima rakwe ra 2005 ra Sinethara tanihi xirho xa nhlawulo wa xifundzha wa Buenos Aires.""  This directly translates to ""Kirchner announced her candidacy at the Theatre of Argentina, a place she used to launch her 2005 campaign as governor of Buenos Aires province.""
* The passage also mentions La Plata is 50km from Buenos Aires, making the theatre 31 miles from Buenos Aires.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Incorrect - The theatre isn't 31 miles from La Plata, it's from Buenos Aires.
* **B:** Incorrect - The theatre is the Theatre *of Argentina*, not *of Buenos Aires and La Plata*.
* **D:** Incorrect - The theatre is the Theatre *of Argentina*, and it's not *in* Buenos Aires, it's a distance away.



"
I yini leswi nga kumiwa hi ACMA malunghana ni Big Brother?,"The correct answer is **A: A ku nga tshoviwanga milawu yo kambela rungula**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ACMA found Big Brother in breach for *not* implementing rules to prevent unauthorized uploads to the internet.  Option A directly reflects this - ""A ku nga tshoviwanga milawu yo kambela rungula"" translates to ""rules to prevent uploads were not implemented.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Vuhaxi byebyo a byi nga hlayisiwanga eka webusayiti ya Big Brother** - While related, the core issue isn't just *where* the content appears, but Big Brother's failure to *prevent* its unauthorized spread.
* **C: A ku tshoviwile milawu yo kambela rungula** - This is the opposite of what the passage says.
* **D: Rungula ri kumiwe ri tshama hi ku kongoma eka server** - This refers to a requirement *of* the law, not the specific breach ACMA found.



"
I swipimelo swihi leswi vuhaxi byi faneleke byi wela ehansi ka byona leswaku byi tekiwa tanihi rungula ra inthanete?,"The correct answer is **B: Byi fanele byi tshama hi ku kongoma eka server**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...leswaku ri tekiwa ri ri rungula ra le ka Inthanete ri fanele ri tshama hi ku kongoma eka server."" ( ""...that if it is considered online content it must reside by being stored on a server."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Byi fanele byi va lebyi haxiweke eka Inthanete** (It should be hacked on the internet) - The passage deals with *preventing* unauthorized hacking, not requiring it.
* **C: A byi fanelanga byi hlayisiwa eka webusayiti** (It shouldn't be published on a website) -  The passage discusses issues with publication but doesn't state it *shouldn't* be published, but rather, publication needs to be managed according to the law.
* **D: Byi fanele byi pfumeriwa hi ACMA** (It should be approved by ACMA) - While ACMA is mentioned, the passage focuses on server storage as a requirement for online content.



"
I mani murhangeri wa Vandla ra Liberal ra le Australia?,"The correct answer is **B: John Howard**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Peter Costello, muhlayisi wa timali wa le Australia ni loyi swi tikombaka a ta teka xikhundlha xa Holobyenkulu **John Howard** tanihi murhangeri wa vandla ra Liberal..."" 

This directly identifies John Howard as the leader of the Liberal Party. Peter Costello was a treasurer *under* John Howard.



"
Ha yini Australia yi nga si va ni vumaki bya matimba ya nyutliya?,"The correct answer is **A: A ku na nseketelo wa vaaki** (There is no public support).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hileswaku, ku hava nkaneto wo karhi wa matimba ya nyutliya"" which translates to ""However, there is no public support for nuclear power.""  This directly answers the question of why Australia shouldn't have nuclear power.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yi pfuxa njhekanjhekisano ngopfu** (It faces too much conflict) - The text doesn't mention internal conflict.
* **C: Yi na khombo ngopfu** (It is too expensive) - While cost could be a factor, it's not the reason stated in the text.
* **D: Yi durha ngopfu** (It is too difficult) - The text focuses on public acceptance, not the difficulty of implementation.



"
I murheti wihi wa le ayisini loyi a nga phikizana hi mpfuno wa mukongomisi?,"The correct answer is **C: Maciej Krezel**.

The passage states: ""Murheti wa le asiyini wa le Poland loyi a nga voniki kahle ku nga Maciej Krezel ni mukongomisi ku nga Anna Ogarzynska va hetelele eka khumemune eka Super-G."" This directly translates to ""The Polish sign guide who did not do well was Maciej Krezel and the guide was Anna Ogarzynska, they competed in the combined Super-G.""  This indicates Maciej Krezel is the skier who competed with a guide.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Anna Jochemsen** - She competed individually, winning in the women's Super-G.
*   **B: Jong Seork Park** - He competed individually in the men's Super-G.
*   **D: Anna Ogarzynska** - She was the *guide* for Maciej Krezel, not the skier.



"
I tiko rihi leri nga hetelela eka vukhume eka Super-G ya vavasati?,"The correct answer is **A: E Finland**.

The passage states: ""Finland ni Katja Saarinen u hetelele eka vukhume eka xiendlakalo lexi fanaka."" (Finland and Katja Saarinen excelled in second place in a similar event.) This directly answers the question."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi malunghana ni Blake leswi nga riki swo kongoma?","The correct answer is **B: U pfumele ku hlasela**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Blake was charged with ""conspiring to pervert the course of justice.""** This means he's accused of trying to interfere with the legal process, *not* of directly participating in the assault itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: U khomiwe kwalaho** - The passage says he *was charged* (khomiwe kwalaho), but doesn’t mention if this is true or not.
* **C: U tirhise mhanzi hi nkarhi wa ku hlasela** - The passage states *someone else* used a weapon during the assault, not Blake.
* **D: U vule leswaku u hoxiwe hi mabodlela** - The passage states others threw bottles *at* the accused, not that Blake admitted to being part of that.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga humelelanga Blake?","The correct answer is **A: U kumiwe a ri ni nandzu wa ku ringeta ku onha ndlela ya vululami**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states ""Blake na yena a khomeriwe ku ringeta ku onha ndlela ya vululami"" (Blake was also charged with inciting violence). This is the direct charge against him mentioned in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: U khomiwile** - While he was charged, the specific charge related to inciting violence is more relevant to what *could* land him in trouble.
*   **C: U hlaseriwe hi mhanzi** - This refers to the other individual, not Blake.
*   **D: U byeriwe leswaku swi nga endleka leswaku u ta ya ejele** - This is a prediction from the investigator, not the initial problem/charge that Blake is facing.



"
I yini leswi mali ya U.N. yo hakela matiko lama khumbiwaka hi ku hisa ka misava yi nge tirhisiwiki eka swona?,"The correct answer is **C: Tindlu leti kotaka ku langutana ni ku khukhuriwa**.

The passage states: ""Mali yi nga tirhiseriwa eka tindlu leti kotaka ku langutana ni ku khukhuriwa, ku tamela mati ku antswa, ni ku byala timbewu to hambanahambana.""  This directly links the funds to building shelters for refugees and displaced people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku byala timbewu to hambanahambana** - While mentioned, it's *one* use of the funds, not what the funds *won't* be used for.
* **B: Ku tisa thekinoloji ku pfuna matiko lama endlaka nhluvuko** - This is what the initial statement says the funds *are* used for, not what they aren't.
* **D: Ku hunguta switandzhaku swa ku hisa ka misava** - The passage mentions addressing tax challenges, but doesn't say the funds are *not* used for this. It's about *raising* funds *through* taxes.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, U.N. yi na ntshembo wa ku ponisa yini?","The correct answer is **A: Mali, hi ku avelana ka thekinoloji**.

Here's why:

The passage states the U.N. hopes to mobilize funds (money) by collecting taxes to help vulnerable countries, *and* share technology to promote development. This directly aligns with option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Timbewu (Seeds):** While the passage mentions planting diverse seeds, it's an *example* of how the money would be used, not the U.N.'s overall goal for assistance.
* **C: Makhwati lama saleke (Lost skills):**  The passage mentions lost skills as a problem, but doesn't state the U.N. is aiming to *provide* these skills.
* **D: Vanhu lava nga khumbeka hi ku tamela mati ku biha (People affected by drought):** Again, this is an example of *who* the assistance would reach, not the U.N.'s core plan.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga vuriwanga hi Albert Muchanga tanihi swilo leswi va ha ta pfumelelana hi swona?,"The correct answer is **B: Siku leri ku sungulaka ku xavisa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: “A hi si pfumelelana eka milawu na ntsengo wa swo famba, kambe leswi hi nga na swona swi ringene leswaku hi sungula ku xavisa hi July 1, 2020”.  This translates to: ""We do not agree on rules and tariffs, but what we have allows us to start trading by July 1, 2020.""

Albert Muchanga specifically says they *do not* agree on rules and tariffs (options C and D), but they *have* agreed on the **date to start trading (July 1, 2020)**. Option A is incorrect because the passage doesn't mention whether Benin will actually join, only that they want to.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ha yini ku xavisa ku nga ta sungula hi July?","The correct answer is **A: Siku ra ku sungula hi July a ku ri xiphemu xa mintwanano ya Nigeria ya ku nghenela AfCFTA**.

Here's why:

The passage states that despite disagreements on rules and tariffs, the aim is to *begin* implementation by July 1, 2020. This implies July is the target date for Nigeria to start participating in AfCFTA. The other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage explicitly states that rules and tariffs are *not* yet agreed upon.
*   **C:** While Albert Muchanga is mentioned, the date isn’t about his approval, but about Nigeria's participation.
*   **D:** The passage says they *don't* agree on rules and tariffs.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi Atlanta Journal-Constitution yi nga sola vatirhi va swa dyondzo hi swona?","The correct answer is **C: Ku kumiwa ka swiphiqo kambe va nga endlanga nchumu hi sweswo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Xiviko xi kombise leswaku mbuyelo wa swikambelo wu tlakukeke hi ndlela leyi hlamarisaka swinene hi ku hatlisa,naswona xi hehla leswaku xikolo xi kume swiphiqo kambe a xi endlanga nchumu hi sweswo."" This directly translates to ""The report showed that test scores had risen significantly through cheating, and it lowered that schools were meeting standards but not actually doing so.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Xiviko xa Journal-Constitution xi kavanyetiwile** - The passage doesn't say the report *was* investigated, only that it *showed* something.
*   **B: Ku tsandzeka ku endla swilo leswintshwa eka swa tidyondzo ta le madorobeni** - This is a general statement about Hall's background, not what the report specifically accused the educators of.
*   **D: Ku vika mapasiselo lama tlakukeke** - The passage states the scores *were* inflated through cheating, but the accusation isn't simply about reporting inflated scores, it's about *how* those scores were achieved (through cheating).



"
"Hi ku ya hi rungula leri nga nyikeriwa eka ndzimana, i yini lexi nga vuriwanga eka xiviko xa Atlanta Journal-Constitution?","The correct answer is **A: Ku tlakuka loku nga tolovelekanga eka mapasiselo** (There was a concerning increase in test scores).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Atlanta Journal-Constitution yi kandziyise xiviko lexi kombiseke swiphiqo swa mbuyelo wa swikambelo."" (Atlanta Journal-Constitution published a report showing concerns about test scores.) and ""xiviko xi kombise leswaku mbuyelo wa swikambelo wu tlakukeke hi ndlela leyi hlamarisaka swinene hi ku hatlisa..."" (the report showed that test scores had increased in a way that was highly suspicious).  This directly relates to a concerning trend in test results.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Vumbhoni bya ku kanvanyetiwa ka maphephe ya swikambelo** (Evidence of test answer sheets being altered) - While this *happened* according to the passage, it's the *result* of the issue, not what the report initially showed.
* **C: Muhluri wa Suparinthendenti wa Tiko eka Lembe ra 2013** (The term of the Superintendent of Education in 2013) - This is a fact mentioned, but not the focus of what the report revealed.
* **D: Swiringanyeto swa ku endla swilo leswintshwa eka swa tidyondzo ta le madorobeni** (Efforts to make improvements to urban education) - This describes Hall's background, not the report's findings.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i rungula rihi leri tivekaka endzhaku ka ku bomiwa?","The correct answer is **A: Nhlayo yo hetelela ya vanhu lava nga vaviseka** (The final number of people injured).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...swiviko swin’wana swi kombisa leswaku ku fe vanhu va nhungu, naswona swiviko leswi tshembekaka swi tiyisekisa leswaku vanhu lava fikaka eka 30 va vavisekile; kambe tinhlayo to hetelela a ti si tiviwa hinkwato."" (Some reports indicate people were injured, and reliable reports confirm that up to 30 people were injured; but the final figures are not yet known).

The question asks what is *unknown* after the bombing. The passage explicitly states the *final number of injured people* is unknown.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Miako leyi tibomu ti bulukeke ekusuhi na yona** (The buildings the bombs exploded near) - The location is known.
* **C: Xana a ku ta va ni timbomu leti engetelekeke leti a ti ta bulukisiwa** (Whether there are more bombs that will explode) - The passage doesn't discuss the possibility of further bombs.
* **D: Swiviko leswi tshembekaka swa vanhu lava feke** (Reliable reports of people who died) - The passage mentions injuries, not deaths, and the *number of injuries* is what's unknown.



"
"Ku sukela a nga nghenela Manchester City hi 2017, Jesus u tlange ka mintlangu yingani?","The correct answer is **D: 53**

The passage states: ""Ku sukela kwalaho, Muburazili loyi u tlange mintlangu ya 53 eka tlilaba..."" which translates to ""Since then, the Brazilian has played 53 games for the club...""



"
I tlilaba yihi leyi Jesus a nga kuma ntsengo wa £27 wa timiliyoni hi ku nghenelela?,"The correct answer is **A: Palmeiras**.

The passage states Jesus moved *from* the Brazilian club Palmeiras to Manchester City. Therefore, Palmeiras is the club he was purchased from for £27 million."
I swiga swihi malunghana ni vaendzi va hostela leswi nga riki ntiyiso?,"The correct answer is **B: Vaendzi van’wana a ku nga ri vanhu va kwalaho.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Votala ka vaendzi lava a va fikele eka hositele a va huma eUnited Arab Emirates."" (It speaks of guests *arriving* at the hotel *from* the United Arab Emirates). This implies not all guests are necessarily local to Mecca or even Saudi Arabia.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vaendzi a ri eMecca hikwalaho ka pilgrimage:** The passage *does* mention pilgrims, but doesn't say *all* the guests are there solely for pilgrimage.
* **C: Vaendzi a va tele eve of hajj:** While the passage mentions the eve of Hajj, it doesn’t state all the guests are there for that specific reason.
* **D: Votala va vaendzi a va huma eka doroba ya ku kwetsima:** The passage states they come *from* the United Arab Emirates, not *from* Mecca (the holy city).



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga ntiyiso?","The correct answer is **B: Vaendzi hinkwavo a va huma eUnited Arab Emirates.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Votala ka vaendzi lava a va fikele eka hositele a va huma eUnited Arab Emirates."" (It speaks of visitors who arrived at the hospital and came from the United Arab Emirates.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A ku na vanhu lava feke** - The passage *does* mention people arriving (""Vanhu lava feke va sungula eka 15""), so this statement is false.
* **C: Vaendzi a va tele eve of hajj pilgrimage** - The passage says people are gathering *to perform the pilgrimage* (""ku vhakela doroba ra ku kwetsima eka siku ra le mahlweni ka hajj pilgrimage""), meaning they *are* related to the hajj.
* **D: Votala va vaendzi a ku ri vanhu va le Mecca** - The passage specifically states the visitors *came from* the United Arab Emirates, not that they are from Mecca.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i rungula rihi malunghana ni ku tlumbana leri nga tiyisekangiki?","The correct answer is **C: Ndlela leyi Misava yi nga ta khumbekaka ha yona hikwalaho ka ku tlumbana**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Na sweswi va ha ringeta ku vona vukulu bya ku tlumbana na **ndlela leyi misava yi nga ta khumbekaka ha yona**."" This directly addresses how the impact might affect the Missouri region.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vukulu bya ku tlumbana:** While the passage mentions the size of the impact, the scientists are *trying to determine* this, not what the passage is currently reporting about.
* **B: Ndhawu ya ku tlumbana:** The location is stated (491 miles north of Missouri), but the focus of the research is on the *effects* of the impact, not the location itself.
* **D: Ndhawu ya ti debiri:**  The Strategic Command analyzes debris, but this is related to the overall impact event, not the primary focus of this particular section of the text.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi va ha ringeta ku swi vona malunghana ni ku tlumbana?","The correct answer is **D: Vukulu lebyi kongomeke bya ku tlumbana** (The size of the explosion).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Na sweswi va ha ringeta ku vona vukulu bya ku tlumbana na ndlela leyi misava yi nga ta khumbekaka ha yona."" This directly translates to ""However, they are still trying to determine the size of the explosion and how the mountains might respond.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I mani la nga ta khoma vukambisisi bya ti debiri** (Who will submit the debriefing results) - The passage mentions *who* will submit the results (United States Strategic Command), but that's not what the scientists are trying to determine.
*   **B: Rivilo leri tisethalayiti a ti tsutsuma hi wona hi nkarhi wa ku tlumbana** (The distance the satellite traveled during the explosion) - The passage states the satellite traveled 17,500 miles *during* the explosion, so it's not something they are trying to find out.
*   **C: Ndlela leyi mbuyelo wa ku kambisisa wu ta averiwa hi yona** (How the findings will be made available) -  The passage mentions the results will be posted on a website, but this isn't what the scientists are trying to discover.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, u tshama a ri eka ndhawu yihi Batten eka nxaxamelo wa Maamerika lama Fuweke Swinene?","The correct answer is **A: Ya vu 400**.

The text states: ""Batten a pimiwa eka nhlayo ya 190 hi 2008 eka **nxaxamelo wa 400** wa Maamerika lama Fuweke Swinene..."" 

This directly translates to ""Batten was ranked among **400** Americans..."""
Batten u hoxe xandla eka yini eka leswi landzelaka?,"The correct answer is **D: Tikholichini ta vutshila na sayense**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""U thwasile Kolichini ya Vutshila ni Sayense le Yunivhesiti ya Virginia hi 1950 naswona u hoxe xandla swinene eka xivandla xexo."" This directly translates to ""He studied Botany and Science at the University of Virginia in 1950 and currently works extensively in that field."" 

While he *studied* at the University of Virginia (B), the passage emphasizes his current work *in the field of botany and science* (D). Options A and C are mentioned in the context of his investment but aren't what he *works* in.



"
I yini lexi nga riki xiphemu xa nawu lowu nga sayiniwa hi Murhangeri Arnold Schwarzenegger?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku sivela ku xavisiwa kumbe ku lombisiwa ka mintlangu ya ti vhidiyo leyi nga ni madzolonga eka vana lavatsongo le California hinkwayo** (Preventing the sale or rental of violent video games to children in all of California).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the law aims to prevent violent video games from being *sold or rented to minors in California*. Options B, C, and D focus on fines, out-of-state sales, or rating classifications – while related, they aren't the *core* of what the law does as described in the text.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani la nga twanga swilo leswi a swi vuriwa?","The correct answer is **C: Miller**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Loko a komberiwa ku nyika swibumabumelo, Miller u te, ‘Mike u vulavula ngopfu hi nkarhi wa nhlangano ...A ndzi nga swi twi kahle leswi a a swi vula.’"" This directly translates to ""When asked to provide testimony, Miller said, 'Mike talks too much during meetings... I don't like what he says.'""

Therefore, Miller is the one doing the talking/stating what is being said.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga ntiyiso hi leswi nga humelela Miller eka nhlangano?","The correct answer is **A: Duvall u tsakise Miller hi nkarhi wa nhlangano** (Duval angered Miller during the meeting).

Here's why:

* The passage states Miller responded to a request for comment by saying, ""Mike spoke too much during the meeting... I can't say I appreciated what he said."" This directly indicates Duval (Mike) did something *during the meeting* that upset Miller.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: A nga nyikele nyingiso loko a ri karhi a ti lunghisa:** The passage doesn't mention anything about Duval offering an apology.
* **C: Vana vambirhi va Duvall a va vulavula ngopfu hi nkarhi wa nhlangano:** The passage only mentions Duval speaking too much, not his children.
* **D: A nyikele nyingiso eka xitori xa Duvall:** The passage states Miller *didn't* give a positive response (he didn't appreciate what Duval said) – he didn't offer an apology *to* Duval.



"
I mani la nga ringanyeta leswaku ku kambisisiwa “Nawu wa Moya wo Tenga”?,"The correct answer is **D: Stephen Harper**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Holobyenkulu Stephen Harper u pfumerile ku rhumela ‘Nawu wa Moya wo Tenga’ wa hulumendhe eka komiti ya mavandla hinkwawo ku wu kambisisa...""  This directly translates to ""Prime Minister Stephen Harper ordered the government's 'Clean Air Act' to be sent to all parliamentary committees for review.""

While Jack Layton (C) requested changes and John Howard (A) is mentioned in a different context, it was Stephen Harper who initiated the review of the act.  Vandla ro fuma hi Swipimelo (B) is simply the source of the act, not someone involved in its review initiation.



"
I mani la nga kaneta leswaku “Nawu wa Moya wo Tenga” a ku ri xiendlo lexi tanihi ndlela yo kavenyeta nhlawulo lowu nga ta endliwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Mulawuri wa humulumendhe ya mfumo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""hulumendhe ya mfumo na ti-MP tin’wana ta federali va sole xiendlo lexi tanihi ndlela yo kavenyeta nhlawulo lowu nga ta endliwa hi Hukuri.""  This directly translates to ""the state government and some federal MPs considered the deal as a way to avoid the penalty that would be imposed by Hukuri.""

Therefore, the state government officials are the ones who saw the ""Nawu wa Moya wo Tenga"" deal as a means to avoid a penalty.



"
Tikhomphawundi ta cyanuric asidi na melamine ti endle yini loko ti cinca ti hlangana eka murhundzu wa swimanga?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti khirisitali**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ti khomphawundi leti timbirhi ta cinca loko ti hlangana ti endla **ti khirisitali** leti nga sivelaka ku tirha ka tinsu..."" (These two compounds change when they come together to form **crystals** that are similar to working with salt...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tinsu** - While the crystals *resemble* salt, they *are not* salt. Salt is the result of the crystals working, not the crystals themselves.
*   **B: Swakudya swa swihari swa le kaya** - These are the source of the problem (where the compounds were found), not what the compounds form.
*   **D: Infrared spectroscopy** - This is a *method used to identify* the crystals, not what they are.



"
Valavisisi va tirhise infrared spectroscopy ku vona yini?,"The correct answer is **B: Endlelo ra ti khirisitali eka murhundzu wa swiharhi swa le kaya**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Valavisisi va langutise ti khirisitali leti endlekeke eka murhundzu wa swimanga hi ku hoxa melamine na cyanuric asidi. Endlelo ra ti khirisitali leti ya fana na lama kumekaka eka murhundzu wa swiharhi leswi khumbekeke loko swi pimanisiwa hi infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).""

This directly means the researchers used infrared spectroscopy to analyze the *structure* (endlelo) of the crystals found in the animal feed, comparing it to those found in contaminated pet food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku tirha ka tinsu** - While the crystals *are* toxic, the spectroscopy wasn't used to detect toxicity itself, but the structure of the crystals.
*   **C: Swiharhi swa le kaya leswi nga khumbeka** - The spectroscopy was used to analyze crystals *found on* the feed, not to identify contaminated feed directly.
*   **D: Swakudya swa swiharhi swa le kaya leswi nyamisiweke** - Spectroscopy was used on crystals extracted from the feed, not on the processed food itself.



"
I mani la nga vitana Luna tanihi “Hosi Ya Xisati ya Xiyimo Xa le Henhla Ngopfu”?,"The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tommy Dreamer u te “Luna a a ri Hosi Ya Xisati ya Xiyimo Xa le Henhla Ngopfu."" This directly translates to ""Tommy Dreamer said, “Luna was the greatest manager of all time.”"" 

Therefore, Tommy Dreamer is the one who called Luna that name.



"
I mani loyi a nga vitana Luna tanihi “hambanile”?,"The correct answer is **B: Dustin Runnels**.

The text states: ""Dustin “Goldust” Runnels u vule leswi “Luna a a hambanile hi ndlela leyinene ku fana na mina...” which translates to ""Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels said 'Luna was very different from me...in a way that was refreshing...I loved her and I will miss her...I believe she is in a better place.'"" 

Therefore, Dustin Runnels is the one who called Luna ""different.""



"
I yini leswi nga si humelela eka muchayeri la nga katseka eka ntlumbano?,"The correct answer is **A: U vaviseke enhlokweni** (He/She was injured in the head).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Hambiswiritano, muchayeri u vaviseke ngopfu enhlokweni."" (However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.) This directly answers the question about what happened to the driver as a result of the accident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: A nga vavisanga na un’we wa vanhu lava a va ri endzeni ka movha** (He/She didn't see any of the people who were in the car) - While mentioned in the text, this isn't *what happened* to the driver *as a result of the accident*.
* **C: U susiwile exibedlhela xa Cambridge a ya eGreat Yarmouth** (He/She was taken to the Cambridge hospital and then to Great Yarmouth) - This describes the *location* of treatment, not the injury itself.
* **D: Vukorhokeri bya xihatla byi pfune ku n’wi susa eka movha wa yena** (The fire brigade managed to remove him/her from the car) - This describes the rescue effort, not the driver's injury.



"
I yini leswi a swi nga humelelanga hi ndlela yo tlanga ya Afrika Dzonga hi nkarhi wa mphikizano wa rugby?,"The correct answer is **A: Ntirhisano lowunene (Strong cooperation)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vatlangi vale ndzhaku lava nga ni ntokoto, na **vuswikoti byo tirhisa bolo ni ntirhisano lowunene** ku endle leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku ntlawa lowu a wu hluriwi.""  This directly translates to ""The players were skilled and **used tactics with bolo and strong cooperation** to ensure they succeeded and it was clear which team wouldn't win.""

While the other options are mentioned in the text, they aren't presented as the *reason* for their potential success – cooperation is.  The text implies that strong cooperation was key to their performance.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ntlangu wa Afrika Dzonga wu sungule rini ku antswa?","The correct answer is **A: Kwalomu ka 10:00 am**.

The passage states: ""Mintlango yi sungule hi 10:00am..."" which directly translates to ""The match started at 10:00am"". 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Endzhaku ka ku tiyisa ku tisirhelela** - This refers to the team playing well and using the ball effectively, not the start time.
* **C: Endzhaku ka ku hluriwa hi Zambia** - The passage states South Africa *beat* Zambia, not the other way around.
* **D: Loko mphikizano wu ya emahlweni** - This refers to their chances worsening as the competition progressed, not the start time.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamuseriki hi ku kongoma ikhonomi ya Chayina?","The correct answer is **A: Ikhonomi ya Chayina yi kule swinene ku sukela ku lunghisiwa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ku sukela kwalaho, ikhonomi ya Chayina yi kule hilaha ku andzisiweke ka 90."" (Since then, the Chinese economy has grown greatly, increasing by 90%.) This directly answers the question of what has happened to the Chinese economy.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate or directly contradicted by the text:

* **B:** While true according to the passage, it's a *result* of the economic growth, not a description *of* the growth itself.
* **C:** The passage says the GDP *will* potentially match the US, but doesn't state it currently has.
* **D:** The passage *states* Chayina yi xavisele matiko timovha to tala ku hundza Jarimani (China *does* export to many countries, including Germany). Therefore, this option is incorrect.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, GDP ya Chayina yi nga hundza ya le United States rini?","The correct answer is **B: Eka malembe ya makume mbirhi**.

The passage states: ""GDP ya Chayina yi nga hundza ya le United States **eka malembe ya makume mbirhi**."" (Chayina's GDP will surpass that of the United States **in twenty years**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Endzhaku ka ku lunghisiwa loku engetelekeke ka ikhonomi** - While economic reforms *lead* to the potential for surpassing the US, it doesn't specify *when* it will happen.
* **C: Loko tiko ri va ehansi ka vurhangeri lebyintshwa** - The passage mentions Deng Xiaoping's reforms, but doesn't link the surpassing of the US to *new* leadership.
* **D: Eka makume manharhu ya malembe** - The passage specifically states ""makume mbirhi"" (twenty), not ""makume manharhu"" (thirty).



"
I yini leswi Hu a nga swi ringanyeta leswaku matiko lama hluvukaka ma swi endla?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku ya ehenhla ka vutihlamuleri bya vona bya sweswi** (To exceed their current levels of emissions).

Here's why:

The passage states Hu believes developing countries ""should not, however, be asked to take on commitments higher than their ability, capacity and circumstances."" This directly implies he expects them to *increase* their emissions, but in a responsible way, rather than being limited to levels below their current capacity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Va byarha vutihlamuleri lebyi nga ta va susumetela ku kula** (They should bear emissions that will promote growth) - While emissions might *result* from growth, this isn't what Hu is specifically arguing for. He's arguing about the *level* of commitment they should be asked to make.
* **B: Ku dzika eka mpindzulo wa ikhonomi** (To rely on economic recovery) - This refers to China's economic response, not what Hu expects of developing countries.
* **D: Ku papalata maendlelo ya khale yo thyakisa** (To abandon old methods of emission) - This relates to overall strategy, not the acceptable level of emissions for developing nations.



"
I yini leswi nga vuriwanga hi Hu?,"The correct answer is **C: Siku leri ku tshembiwaka leswaku ku ta hungutiwa nthyakiso wa khaboni dayiokisayidi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** “Hi ta ringeta ku hunguta nthyakiso wa khaboni dayiokisayidi hi yuniti yin’we ya GDP hi mpimo lowu nyawulaka hi 2020 ku suka eka mpimo wa 2005,” - This directly translates to ""We will strive to reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by a measurable amount by 2020 compared to 2005.""  This is a commitment to a *future reduction* of emissions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku endliwa ka ku hunguta** - (The act of reduction) - The passage discusses a *goal* of reduction, not an act already happening.
* **B: Xitsundzuxo eka matiko lama hluvukaka malunghana ni ku thyakisa** - (Pressure on developing countries regarding emissions) - While Hu mentions changing old growth models, the passage doesn't focus on pressure *on* developing countries.
* **D: Mpimo wa ku hunguteka ka nthyakiso wa carbon** - (The rate of carbon emission reduction) - The passage mentions a *target* for reduction, but not the actual *rate* of reduction.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi Veerman a nga vula leswaku xiyimo a xi ka kahle eka swona?,"The correct answer is **B: E Angola**.

Here's why:

Richard Veerman specifically states, ""xiyimo xa ha bihile swinene **eAngola**"" which translates to ""the situation is very bad **in Angola**.""  He's directly linking the poor conditions to the country of Angola.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Medecines Sans Frontieres:** This is the *organization* he represents, not the place where the bad situation exists.
*   **C: Mangola:** Mangola is one of the organizations involved, but the statement doesn't say the situation is bad *at* Mangola.
*   **D: Nhlangano wa Rihanyo wa Misava Hinkwayo:** Similar to Mangola, this is an organization, not the location of the problem.



"
"Hikwalaho ka ku tengisiwa, i mani la nga ta teka xiyimo xa Huhne xa Khabinete?","The correct answer is **A: Davey**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Huhne u tsale papila ro tshika ntirho eka Khabinete naswona u ta siviwa hi Ed Davey MP.""  This directly translates to ""Huhne resigned from his position in the Cabinet and will be replaced by Ed Davey MP.""

Therefore, Davey will take over Huhne's position.



"
I mani la nga ta teka ntirho wa Ndzawulo ya swa Mabindzu loko ku tengisiwile?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

The text states: ""Nirman Lamb MP u languteriwe ku teka ntirho wa Ndzawulo ya swa Mabindzu leyi Davey a yi sukelaka."" This directly translates to ""Nirman Lamb MP has been appointed to take the role of the Department for Transport that Davey is leaving.""



"
Vatlangi va khuthaza vahlaleri leswaku va endla yini hi nkarhi wa ntlangu wa Camille Saint-Saens?,"The correct answer is **C: Va va joyina exitejini ku endla ntlangu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...vatlangi va dzaha mbangi va ri exitejini naswona xitori hi xoxe xi khutaza vahlaleri leswaku na vona va va joyina."" This directly translates to ""the composers were excited and the story encourages the audience to join them."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Va hlanganyela eka ku dzaha mbangi** - While the composers *are* composers, the passage doesn't say the audience should compose with them.
* **B: Va teka riendzo va ya eJapani** - The story is *about* someone whose life was influenced by Japan, but it doesn't encourage the audience to travel there.
* **D: Va pfumelela vutomi bya vona byi lawuriwa hi leswi va swi rhandzhaka** - This is a theme within the story of the person it's about, not a call to action for the audience.



"
I mani kahle-kahle loyi a dzahaka mbangi hi nkarhi wa ntlangu?,"The correct answer is **A: Mutshila**.

Here's why:

The passage states the story is about ""loyi vutomi byakwe byi lawuriwaka hi ku rhandza swidzidziharisi ni tiko ra Japani"" (someone whose life was marked by a passionate love for the country of Japan). This person is referred to as ""mutshila"" (a musician).  The story is *about* this musician.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Vahlaleri va Mafurwa (French people):** While the opera is French, the story isn't *about* the French people generally, but a specific individual.
* **C: Vatlangi (composers):**  The passage mentions composers, but is about the subject of the opera, not the composers themselves.
* **D: Camille Saint-Saens:** He *composed* the opera, but the story *within* the opera is about a different person.



"
I rihi vito rin’wana ra “ku famba exibakabakeni” loku Leonov a nga ku endla?,"The correct answer is **C: Ntirho lowu wu sunguriweke ku endliwa hi munhu wa kuya exibakabakeni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hi March 18, 1965, u endle ntirho lowu wu sunguriweke ku endliwa hi munhu wa kuya exibakabakeni (EVA), kumbe """"ku famba exibakabakeni"""". This directly translates to ""On March 18, 1965, he completed the first task to be done by a person in space (EVA), or ""walking in space"".""  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ntirho wa Apollo-Soyuz** - This was a later joint mission, not the first spacewalk.
*   **B: Mphikizano wa le Xibakabakeni** - This is the space race itself, not the spacewalk.
*   **D: Cosmonaut No. 11** - This is a title given to Leonov, not the act of spacewalking.



"
Leonov u rhangele xiphemu xa Soviet eka ntirho wihi?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

The passage states: ""U kume sagwati ra le henhla ngopfu ra le Soviet Union leri vitaniwaka “Nghwazi ya Soviet Union” Malembe ya khume endzhaku, u rhangele xiyenge xa Soviet xa Apollo–Soyuz leswi a swi kombisa leswaku mphikizano wa le xibakabakeni wu herile.""  This directly translates to: ""He held a high position in the Soviet Union known as “Soviet Glory”. Later in life, he oversaw the Soviet side of Apollo–Soyuz which showed that the space race was over.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mphikizano wa le Xibakabakeni (Space Race):** While the Apollo-Soyuz mission *indicated* the end of the space race, Leonov didn't simply oversee the race itself.
*   **C: Cosmonaut No. 11:** This is a title, not a project he oversaw.
*   **D: EVA (Extravehicular Activity/spacewalk):** He was the first to *perform* an EVA, but didn't oversee it later in life.



"
I mani la nga vaviseka eka ku chayisa?,"The correct answer is **D: Muchayeri wa lori**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Muchayeri wa lori, wa malembe ya 64, a nga vavisekaka loko yi chayisile."" This directly translates to ""The 64-year-old truck driver is needed if it crashes.""  This indicates he is the one who was driving/involved in the crash.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gibson:** Gibson is mentioned as having died in the crash, not as the driver.
* **B: Munhu loyi a tirha egaraji (The person who works at the garage):**  He's a witness, not the driver.
* **C: Vana (Children):** The children were nearby and observing, but weren't driving.

Ku endleke yini hi vanhu lava nga katseka eka khombo?,"The correct answer is **A: Va file va ri vambirhi** (Two people died).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Gibson u tlekitliwile a yisiwa exibedlhela kambe u file ku nga ri khale."" (Gibson was taken to the hospital but died shortly after.)
* It also mentions the lorry driver, age 64, is missing: ""Muchayeri wa lori, wa malembe ya 64, a nga vavisekaka loko yi chayisile."" (The 64-year-old lorry driver is missing.)

Therefore, one confirmed death (Gibson) and one missing (presumed dead) means two people are affected by death.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Un’we u vavisekile, un’we u file** (One is missing, one died) - While true, it doesn't fully encompass the information.
* **C: A va huwelela ni ku rila** (They didn't cry or grieve) - This describes the children who witnessed the scene, not those *affected* by the crash.
* **D: Va vavisekile va ri vambirhi** (Two are missing) - Only the driver is explicitly stated as missing; Gibson is confirmed dead.

Van’wasayense lava tirhaka eka nongonoko a va tshemba leswaku va ta vona nhlohlotelo wihi eka leswi landzelaka?,"The correct answer is **D: Nchumu wa ntima**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Van’wasayense va swi kotile ku gimeta hileswaku nchumu wa ntima wu khumba nchumu wun’wana wa ntima hilaha nchumu lowu tolovelekeke wa ntima wu endlaka hakona."" (Scientists have managed to estimate that a black hole is swallowing another black hole where the favored black hole ends).  

This clearly indicates the scientists are interested in observing the swallowing of **another black hole** (nchumu wa ntima) by the ""favored"" one. The passage focuses on the interaction *between* black holes.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nchumu lowu tolovelekeke (The favored black hole):** While important, the scientists are observing *what happens to* the other black hole, not just the favored one.
*   **B: Matimba ya gandlati (Gravitational forces):** These are the *cause* of the event, not what they expect to *see*.
*   **C: Swiphemuphemu leswitsongo (Dense gases):** These are related to the formation of the black hole but not the primary observation scientists are focused on in this scenario.



"
Van’wasayense va vone nchumu wa yini eka leswi landzelalaka?,"The correct answer is **D: Xirimela xa Sagittarius na Milky Way**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the phenomenon is linked to interactions between the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy and the Milky Way. It specifically mentions that the Milky Way exerts gravitational forces on the Sagittarius galaxy and that the dark matter halo around Sagittarius interacts with the Milky Way's dark matter. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Milky Way na N’weti:** While the Milky Way is mentioned, the Moon (N’weti) is only briefly referenced as a point of comparison for magnitude, not a core element of the scientific finding.
*   **B: Misava na xirimela xa Sagittarius:** ""Misava"" refers to stars. While stars are *within* the Sagittarius galaxy, the focus isn't on individual stars, but the galaxy as a whole and its interaction with the Milky Way.
*   **C: Misava na N’weti:** Same reasoning as A and B – this combination isn't the central finding.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi nga riki swi xopaxopiwa hi lava nga ni mavonelo ya vona?","The correct answer is **B: Ku pfumaleka ka matshalatshala ya mpfuxeto** (The awarding of reconstruction contracts).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku xopaxopa ka lava lwelaka ntshunxeko ka matshalatshala ya mpfuxeto lama lavaka ku nyika tikontiraka ta mpfuxeto eka lava tekiwaka va le vatirhi va le ndzeni ka Washington.""  This translates to: ""There was discontent among those who felt the awarding of reconstruction contracts favored insiders connected to Washington.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mali leyi tirhisiweke** (The money that was used) - While money *is* mentioned, the passage focuses on *how* it was used (through contracts) and the complaints about that process, not the money itself being the point of contention.
* **C: I mani la nga kuma tikontiraka ta mpfuxeto** (Who got the reconstruction contracts) - This is *related* to the discontent, but the passage specifically highlights the *process* of awarding the contracts being the problem, not just *who* got them.
* **D: Ku tirhisa mali eka mpfuxeto** (Using money for reconstruction) - This is a general statement and doesn’t reflect the specific criticism mentioned in the passage.



"
I mani la nga xopaxopa mpfuxeto wa tikontiraka eka matshalatshala ya ku pfuna Bubutsa ra Katrina?,"The correct answer is **B: Lava lwelaka ntshunxeko**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku xopaxopa ka lava lwelaka ntshunxeko ka matshalatshala ya mpfuxeto lama lavaka ku nyika tikontiraka ta mpfuxeto eka lava tekiwaka va le vatirhi va le ndzeni ka Washington.""  This directly translates to ""Those with connections were accused of giving contracts to those connected to workers in Washington.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lava nga ni mavonelo ya vona va endleke mafenya:** This refers to people who criticized the response, calling it ""Bush's New Orleans Failure,"" not those giving out contracts.
*   **C: Bush:** While the criticism focuses on Bush's administration, the passage doesn't say *he* specifically awarded the contracts.
*   **D: Vatirhi va le ndzeni ka Washington:** They *received* the contracts, they didn't give them out.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, hi le kwihi la ku nga ta va vonanakala ku sungula nkombiso ku huma eka xibamubamu xa Stardust?","The correct answer is **B: N’walungwini wa California**.

Here's why:

The passage states: “Xi ta suka eribuweni ra le vupeladyambu bya n’walungu wa California naswona xi ta voninga tilo ku suka eCalifornia kuya fika exikarhi ka Oregon na kuya fika le Nevada na Idaho na Utah.” This directly says the meteor will be visible *first* from California.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, xibamubamu xi ta veka rhekhodo leyintshwa ya yini eka leswi landzelaka?","The correct answer is **C: Ku tlhelela Emisaveni hi ku hatlisa swinene** (Traveling to the heavens the fastest).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Stardust yi ta veka rhekhodo leyintshwa ya misava hi ku va xibamubamu lexintshwa xa nkarhi hinkwawo lexi nga ta tlhelela eMisaveni..."" which translates to ""Stardust will set a new record for speed by being the fastest object ever to travel to the heavens...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku voninga tilo hi vukulu lebyi nga anama swinene** (Seeing the trail with great size) - The passage mentions the trail being bright but doesn't relate it to a record.
*   **B: Ku vonaka eka madoroba yo tala** (Seeing many cities) - While it will be visible over several states, the record isn't about *seeing* cities.
*   **D: Ku suka e San Francisco ku fika le Los Angeles hi ku hlatlisa swinene** (Going from San Francisco to Los Angeles the fastest) - This is used as an example to illustrate speed, but isn't the record itself. The record is for speed *to the heavens*.



"
Dr. Malar Balasubramanian i maxaka njhani na Saroja Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **C: Manana**. 

The text states ""Kwalaho, va kume ntsumbu wa Saroja Balasubramanian, 53, wu funengetiwe hi mikumba leyi nga ni ngati"" and earlier mentions Dr. Malar Balasubramanian. This implies Saroja Balasubramanian is Dr. Malar Balasubramanian's mother (""manana"" in Tsonga).



"
Hi le kwihi la ku nga kumiwa ntsumbu wa Sara Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **B: Ekusuhi ni patu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""U kumiwile le Blue Ash, Ohio, muganga wa kwalomu ka timayili ta 15 en’walungwini wa Cincinnati a etlele ehansi **ekusuhi ni patu** a ambale xikipa ni xirhangiso a languteka a nwe mirhi swinene."" This directly indicates the body was found near a cliff.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Le Cincinnati** - While Blue Ash is near Cincinnati, the body wasn't *in* Cincinnati.
*   **C: Ebutini ya movha** - This refers to where Dr. Balasubramanian lived, not where the body was found.
*   **D: Le Pittsburgh** - The story starts by mentioning Pittsburgh, but the events happen in Ohio, near Cincinnati.



"
I yini leyi nga xaviwa hi eBay?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

Here's why:

The passage states the company is looking to compete with areas where Skype is strong - China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil. This indicates eBay is looking to compete *with* Skype, meaning Skype is the company being referenced. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Microsoft:** Microsoft *owns* Skype, but the passage isn't about Microsoft itself.
* **B: Apple:** Apple isn't directly mentioned or implied as a competitor in the passage.
* **D: Zoom:** Zoom isn't mentioned as a competitor in the passage.



"
I yini leswi eBay yi lavaka ku swi fikelela hi leswi nga xaviwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku hlanganisa mali leyi nghenaka** (To consolidate revenue).

Here's why:

The passage states the company *expects to consolidate the areas where it makes money* and become stronger in countries where Skype is weak – specifically mentioning China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil. This directly relates to improving their financial performance by focusing on profitable areas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku ya eka tindhawu letintshwa** (To go to new areas) - While expansion is implied, the *primary* focus is on strengthening where they already earn revenue.
* **C: Ku kurisa xiyimo xa yona** (To improve its position) - This is a broad statement. The passage specifies *how* they want to improve their position - through revenue consolidation.
* **D: Ku enerisa lava ku nga endliwa bindzu na vona** (To energize those who are not doing well with it) -  The passage doesn't mention anything about energizing users or addressing weaknesses within its existing user base.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i va mani lava nga tihlanganisaka ni vabohiwa lava nga sala ejarateni endzhaku ka ku lwa?","The correct answer is **C: Vatirhelamfumo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Exikarhi ka 10:00-11:00 nivusiku MDT, ku pfuke ndzilo lowu vangiweke hi vabohiwa ejarateni. Ku nga ri khale, **vatirhelamfumo** lava a va hlome hi switirho swo lwisana ni hasahasa va nghene ejarateni ivi va hlasela vabohiwa hi gasi yo humesa mihloti."" 

This clearly indicates that the *vatirhelamfumo* (officials/authorities - those not aligned with law and order) are the ones who attacked the remaining prisoners.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vakanerisi:** They tried to *resolve* the situation, not join the fight against the prisoners.
*   **B: Mintlawa yo sirhelela endzilweni:** They *stopped* the attack, they didn't participate in it.
*   **D: Vatirhi va le xibedlhela:** The passage doesn't say they participated in the attack.



"
I yini eku heteleleni leswi nga vanga leswaku vabohiwa va tshika hasahasa?,"The correct answer is **B: Gasi yo humesa mihloti**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""...vatirhelamfumo lava a va hlome hi switirho swo lwisana ni hasahasa va nghene ejarateni ivi va hlasela vabohiwa hi **gasi yo humesa mihloti**."" ( ""...officials not equipped with riot gear entered the jail and attacked the inmates with **tear gas**."")

This directly links the tear gas to causing distress to the inmates.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku kanerisana loku nga humelela** (Unrelated incidents) - The text describes a specific sequence of events, not just unrelated incidents.
*   **C: Vabohiwa kulobye lava nga vaviseka** (Inmates who had previously escaped) - While the text mentions inmates escaping earlier, it doesn't connect that to the current distress.
*   **D: Ndzilo** (Fire) - The fire was a *result* of the situation, not the *cause* of the inmates' distress. It was extinguished *after* the tear gas was used.



"
"Hi ku ya hi vonelo ra Ali Khamenei, tiko ra Iran ri fanele ri ti ntshuxa eka yini?","The correct answer is **D: Ku tirhisiwa ngopfu ka oyili**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Murhangerikulu wa tiko, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, u hlamusele ku tirhisiwa ngopfu ka oyili tanihi """"ntlhamu"""" ku sukela emahlweni ka hundzuluko wa Vuislamu bya Iran hi 1979 naswona tiko ri fanele ku titshunxa eka swona.""  This directly translates to ""The country's leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has described the exploitation of oil as a 'necessity' since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the country must rely on it.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku siveriwa ka timali (Receiving funds):** While the passage mentions financial dealings, Khamenei doesn't say Iran should *rely* on receiving funds.
*   **B: Hundzuluko wa Vuislamu (Islamic Revolution):**  He links oil to the revolution, but doesn't say Iran should rely on the revolution itself.
*   **C: Mali yo huma eka matiko man’wana (Money from other countries):** Similar to A, this is mentioned but not presented as something Iran should depend on.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani la nga pfumela leswaku ku yirisiwa ku ni nkucetelo eka ikhonomi ya Iran?","The correct answer is **A: Swihlovo swa mahungu leswi nga le henhla**.

The passage states: ""leti endliwaka thwii eka thelevhixini, a ku ri ro sungula laha swihlovo swa mahungu swa le Iran swi pfumeleke leswaku ku yirisiwa ku ni nkucetelo.""  This directly translates to ""the actions taken on television, and we begin where the sanctions of foreign countries have allowed for the economy to be brought to its knees.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: OPEC:** OPEC discusses oil production levels, but the passage doesn't state they *caused* the economic hardship.
*   **C: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei:** He talks about the importance of oil, not causing economic hardship.
*   **D: European Union:** While the EU is mentioned regarding financial dealings, the passage specifically attributes the economic downfall to foreign sanctions generally.

Here's why:

The passage states that ballots are cast *by* poll workers who are carefully vetted. It does *not* mention ballots being cast *by* representatives of candidates.  The other options are all explicitly mentioned in the passage as part of the voting process in Furwa:

* **A:** ""Mabokisi ya tivhoti ma fanele va vonikela"" - Boxes must be transparent.
* **B:** ""Vayimeri lava rhumeriwaka hi lava vhoteriwaka"" - Representatives can observe.
* **C:** ""Ku sayina buku ya lava nga vhota"" - Voters sign the voter roll.

Hi le kwihi laha lava vhotaka va nga kombisaka munhu loyi a vhoteriwaka loyi va nga nwi hlawula?,"The correct answer is **B: Eka phepha leri printiweke ka ha ri emahlweni**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""vavhoti va hoxa eka mvhilopho phepha leri printiweke ha ri emahlweni leri kombaka munhu loyi va n’wi vhotelaka."" This directly translates to ""voters mark on a printed paper that shows the person they are voting for.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Eka buku ya lava nga vhota** - The book of voters is for signing *after* voting, to confirm they've voted.
*   **C: Eka mvhilopho** - The envelope is where the ballot is placed *after* marking it.
*   **D: Eka muchini endzeni ka xikamara** - The text doesn't mention a machine within the voting booth.



"
I yini leswi nga endla Allen a sungula vulavisisi bya malembe ya nhungu bya Musashi?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku tsakela ka yena nyimpi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...u sungule riendzo ra yena ro lavisisa Musashi tanihi ku tsakela ka yena ka vutomi enyimpini."" This translates to ""...he started his journey to study Musashi as a reflection of his own life in warfare.""  This directly links his interest in Musashi to his passion for warfare.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rifuwo ra yena (His wealth)** - While his wealth allowed him to *fund* the research, it wasn't the initial motivation.
*   **B: Ku tsakela ka yena ku landzelela mepe wa le lwandle (His interest in following ocean maps)** - The passage mentions following maps as a *method* of investigation (using an ROV), not the reason *for* the investigation.
*   **C: Vuvekisi bya yena eka vuvalangi bya le matini (His respect for marine researchers)** - This is mentioned as something he did, but not what *caused* him to study Musashi.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, Allen u hete nhlayo leyikulu ya mali ya yena eka yini?","The correct answer is **A: Ku vuyeteriwa ka Musashi**.

Here's why:

The passage states Allen ""sungule riendzo ra yena ro lavisisa Musashi tanihi ku tsakela ka yena ka vutomi enyimpini"" (started his journey to investigate Musashi as a tribute to his life as a warrior). This clearly indicates his significant investment (nhlayo leyikulu ya mali ya yena - large portion of his wealth) is dedicated to the pursuit of understanding Musashi.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Vuvalangi bya le matini:** While he supports marine research, the passage doesn’t say he spent a *large* portion of his money on it directly.
*   **C: Ku aka ROV:** Building the ROV is a tool *for* the investigation, not the main recipient of his funds.
*   **D: Ku dyondza hi ku landzelela mepe wa le lwandle:** Charting the ocean floor is part of the process, but not the ultimate goal or the main expense.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi endleke leswaku ku va ni swiyimo swa khombo endzeni ni le kusuhi ka vumaki?","The correct answer is **A: Petirolo ya yureniyamu (Uranium fuel)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...switameri leswi nga ni petirolo ya yureniyamu eka xivandla xexo swi nga ha va swi phandlukile ivi swi pfuta.""  This translates to ""...the fuel containing uranium at the core might not have been different or melted."" This directly links the uranium fuel to a potentially dangerous situation within the reactor, suggesting a critical condition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Caesium leyi nga ni miseve ya matimba (Highly radioactive caesium):** While dangerous, caesium is a *result* of the reactor issue, not the cause of the potentially critical state. It's a byproduct of the reaction.
* **C: Musi wo basa (Steam):** Steam is a symptom of the reactor's operation, but not the core issue causing concern.
* **D: Iodine:** Similar to caesium, iodine is a radioactive byproduct, not the primary cause of a dangerous situation.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Valawuri va ndhawu va lemukisa vaaki lava nga ekusuhi ni vumaki leswaku va nga humeli ehandle...""  This directly translates to ""Local authorities advised people near the plant not to go outside...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku papalata ku tirhisa michini yo titimerisa moya** (Avoiding using air conditioners) - While air conditioners are mentioned, the advice is *to turn them off* not to avoid using them generally.
* **C: Ku papalata ku hefumula musi wo basa** (Avoiding breathing during work) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Ku nga nwi mati ya le pompini** (Not drinking water from the pump) - This is a specific instruction, but the broader, more general safety precaution given to the public was to stay indoors.



"
"Hi ku ya hi Dr.Moll, i yini leswi karhataka ngopfu hi XDR-TB?","The correct answer is **D: Nhlayo leyikulu ya vanhu lava faka**.

Here's why:

The passage states Dr. Moll said the outbreak is caused by a ""large number of people infected."" This directly corresponds to option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Muxaka lowu nga kumiwa exibedlhela** - While the passage mentions the outbreak, it doesn't say that *the outbreak itself* is the most dangerous thing.
*   **B: Muxaka lowu nga dlayiwiki hi swidzidzirisi** - The passage doesn't discuss whether the outbreak can be treated with medication.
*   **C: Nhlayo ya vanhu lava nga tluleteriwa hi vuvabyi ku suka eka munhu la nga ni vuvabyi** - The passage mentions transmission from one person to many (10-15), but Dr. Moll identifies the *scale of infection* as the biggest problem.



"
I vavabyi va ngani lava nga tluleteriwa hi muxaka lowuntshwa lava ku nga tiyisisiwa leswaku i vatirhi va rihanyo?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""vambirhi a va ri vatirhi va rihanyo va le xibedlhela."" This translates to ""two of them were contact tracers at the facility.""  The question asks how many researchers were identified as contact tracers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 10** - This is the *maximum* number of people a single infected person could infect, not the number of researchers who were contact tracers.
* **C: 15** - Same as above, it’s a potential number of contacts, not the researchers.
* **D: 1** - The text specifically states *two* researchers were contact tracers.



"
I muxaka muni wa thekinoloji lowu fambiselo ra NextGen ri wu tirhisaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Thekinoloji leyi yi titshegeke hi sathalayiti**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Yi tirhisa thekinoloji leyi yi titshegeke hi sathalayiti hi ku hambana na thekinoloji leyi yi titshegeke hi rada..."" (It uses satellite-based technology in contrast to radar-based technology...).



"
NextGen yi vuyeriwa njhani hi ku kongoma eka swilo leswi lawulaka ku famba ka swihaha-mpfhuka?,"The correct answer is **A: Tindlela to koma ta swihaha-mpfhuka** (Ways to manage air traffic).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""NextGen i mafambiselo lama FAA yi tiyisekisa leswaku yi ta endla xihaha mpfhuka xi famba hi tindlela leti komeke..."" (NextGen is the FAA's plan to ensure air traffic flows in an organized manner...).  The question asks *how* NextGen improves air traffic control, and the passage answers that it does so through organized methods of management.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tindhawu leti kongomeke swinene ta swihaha-mpfhuka** (Areas most congested with air traffic) - The passage doesn't focus on *where* congestion is, but *how* to manage it.
* **C: Ku hunguteka ka ku humesiwa ka khaboni** (Reduction in carbon emissions) - While mentioned as a *result* of NextGen, it's not how it works to control traffic.
* **D: Petiroli leyitsongo** (Expensive petrol) - This is not mentioned in the passage at all.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, van’wamatimu a va solanga FBI hi ku dzika eka yini?","The correct answer is **B: Ku kongomisa switirhisiwa eka vugevenga lebyi nga tlhantlheka hi ku olova.**

Here's why:

The passage states the attorneys were suing the FBI ""hi ku kongomisa switirhisiwa etimhakeni leti swi olovaka ku tiololoxa"" - meaning they were suing over the misuse of tools that allowed for surveillance. This directly relates to using resources to conduct illegal surveillance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku pfuneta ku humelela:** While the goal is to benefit their clients, the lawsuit isn't *about* seeking benefits directly.
*   **C: Ku dzika ngopfu eka milandzu ya swifaniso swa vanhu lava kuleke lava nga ambalanga leswaku va navetisa:**  The passage mentions the FBI needing to provide 10 identifiers for unidentified people, but the lawsuit isn't primarily *about* those specific cases; it’s about *how* the FBI gathered information.
*   **D: Milandzu ya timovha leti nga yiviwa:** While mentioned, the unsolved murders are a context for *why* the surveillance was problematic, not the core of the lawsuit itself.



"
Goza ra leswi yirisiwaka ri sindzisa FBI leswaku yi endla yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Yi kongomisa switirhisiwa eka milandzu ya timovha leti nga yiviwa** (It investigates the use of resources in unsolved missing persons cases).

Here's why:

The passage states the committee started collecting information in 2005 and decided the FBI *should* monitor unsolved missing persons cases. This directly relates to investigating resources used in those cases.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku pfuneta ku humelela ka ndzawulo:** (To encourage departmental success) - The passage doesn't mention encouraging success, only investigating.
* **C: Ku dzika eka vugevenga lebyi nga tlhantlheka hi ku olova:** (To focus on crime that appears through abduction) - While missing persons *could* involve abduction, the passage is broader than just that type of crime.
* **D: Ku nyika vatirhi va ndzawulo milandzu ya swifaniso swa vanhu lava kuleke lava nga ambalanga leswaku va navetisa:** (To give employees cases of images of missing people who have been found so they can testify) - The passage mentions *monitoring* images of missing people, not giving cases to employees for testimony.



"
Ku endleke yini hi movha wo tima ndzilo lowu a wu ya ku pfuneta eka ku tlumbana ka JAS 39C Gripen? ,"The correct answer is **B: Wu vumbulukile**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Swiviko swa vuhaxamahungu swi vula leswaku **movha wo tima ndzilo wa le rivaleni ra swihahampfhuka wu vumbulukile** loko wu ya eku pfuneni.""  This directly translates to ""Reports indicate that the landing gear malfunctioned as it was retracting.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wu tlumbanile** (It crashed) - The text doesn't say the plane crashed, only that the landing gear had a problem.
*   **C: Wu bulukile** (It took off) - The text states the plane *was* taking off when the issue occurred.
*   **D: Wu heleriwe hi petiroli** (It was fueled by petrol) - This is irrelevant to the issue described.



"
"Endzhaku ka ku tlumbana ka JAS 39C Gripen, rivala ra xihaha-mpfhuka ri pfariwile hikwalaho ka yini?","The correct answer is **A: Swihahampfhuka leswi tolovelekeke**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ivi rivala ra swihahampfhuka ri pfaleriwa **swihahampfhuka leswi tolovelekeke**.""  This directly translates to ""...the accident area was cordoned off with **relevant aircraft**.""  The cordoning off was *because* of the relevant aircraft being present, likely for investigation or safety.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Timovha ta ku tima ndzilo:** While the text mentions a fire extinguishing system malfunction, it doesn't say this is *why* the area was cordoned off.
* **C: Swiviko swa vuhaxamahungu swa le ndhawini:** These reported the malfunction, but didn't cause the cordoning.
* **D: Varhangeri va Squandron:** The pilot's name is mentioned, but they aren't the reason for the cordon.



"
Brzezinski u nyike nkongomiso eka mani hi nkarhi wa Hundzuluko wa Iran?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tanihi NSA, u pfune Carter eku tameleni timhaka misava hi vutswatsi, tanihi... Hundzuluko wa Iran, loyi vangeke hasahasa ya mpfalelo wa Iran, hi 1979."" This directly links Brzezinski to advising **Carter** on the handling of the Iran hostage crisis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kissinger:** The text mentions Brzezinski *replacing* Kissinger, but doesn't say Brzezinski criticized him regarding the Iran hostage crisis.
*   **B: Kennedy:** Kennedy is mentioned in the first sentence as someone Brzezinski previously worked with, but not in relation to the Iran situation.
*   **D: Johnson:** Johnson is also mentioned as a past employer, and is not relevant to the Iran hostage crisis.

I mani la nga tirha eka xiyimo xa National Security Advisor ku fikela hi 1977?,"The correct answer is **B: Kissinger**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...a tlhandlama Henry Kissinger."" which means he *replaced* Henry Kissinger as National Security Advisor. Therefore, Kissinger held the position *before* Brzezinski took over in 1977.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Brzezinski** - He started in 1977, not *before*.
*   **C: Carter** - He was President, not the National Security Advisor.
*   **D: Johnson** - He was President in the 1960s, long before Brzezinski became NSA.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga kombisiki hi ku kongoma ku tlanga ka Bobek eka Partizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **B: U howise tibolo to tala ku tlula mutlangi wihi na wihi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""A kuna un’wana loyi a tlangeke ku n’wi tlula kumbe ku howhisa tibolo to tlula ta Bobek eka ntlawa."" This translates to ""No one has ever been able to surpass or score more goals than Bobek in the league."" This directly highlights his unmatched scoring record.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While he scored 468 goals, this is just a fact *about* his performance, not *why* it's remarkable.
* **C:** Being honored as the greatest player in 1995 is an honor, but doesn't relate to his scoring ability while *playing* for Partizan.
* **D:** The text says he scored 403 *for* the team, not that he played more matches than anyone else.



"
I swiga swihi malunghana ni matimu ya Partizan Belgrade leswi nga ntiyiso?,"The correct answer is **A: U sungule ku tlangela Partizan hi 1945**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states ""U hlangane na vona hi 1945 naswona u tshame ku fikela 1958"" which translates to ""He joined them in 1945 and played until 1958.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage states he played for Zagreb *before* Partizan.
*   **C:** He played *until* 1958, not 1995. He was honored in 1995.
*   **D:** He was *honored* in 1995, not that he finished playing then.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i xihlawulekisi xihi lexi hambanisaka Hesperonychus eka Velociraptor?","The correct answer is **B: Yi na nw’ala lowu kuleke** (It has a small claw).

Here's why:

The text states: ""N’wala wa yona wa vumbirhi a wu kurile, leswi vangeke leswaku yi thyiwa Hesperonychus leswi vulaka """"n’wala wa le vupeladyambu."""" "" This translates to ""Its second claw is small, which distinguishes Hesperonychus from what is called a 'sickle claw'.""  Velociraptors are known for their prominent sickle claw on the second toe.  Hesperonychus having a *small* claw is the key difference mentioned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yi na milenge yimbirhi** (It has two legs) - Both Hesperonychus and Velociraptor walk on two legs.
*   **C: Yi na miri lowu nga ni tinsiva hi ku helela** (It has a body that is light for running) - The text says it's lightweight, but this isn’t presented as a *distinguishing* feature from Velociraptor.
*   **D: Yi na ngati yo hisa** (It has sharp teeth) - Both dinosaurs likely had sharp teeth; it's not a difference.



"
Nhlamuselo ya “Hesperonychus” yi huma eka xihlawulekisi xihi xa miri wa swivumbiwa?,"The correct answer is **A: N’wala kumbe min’wala** (Claws or feet).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...yi ri ni min’wala yo fana na Velociraptor. N’wala wa yona wa vumbirhi a wu kurile, leswi vangeke leswaku yi thyiwa Hesperonychus leswi vulaka """"n’wala wa le vupeladyambu."""" "" This directly translates to ""...it had claws similar to Velociraptor. Its second claw was curved, which is what earned it the name Hesperonychus, meaning """"claw foot.""""

Therefore, the name ""Hesperonychus"" is derived from a characteristic of its feet/claws.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Miri ya ku va ni tinsiva** (Being lightweight) - While the passage mentions it was lightweight, this isn't the origin of its name.
*   **C: Milenge** (Legs) - The passage mentions it walked on two legs, but this isn't the basis for the name.
*   **D: Nomu** (Body) - The passage doesn't indicate the name comes from a general body feature.



"
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga ntiyiso malungana ni ku duvuriwa?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku duvuriwa ku humelele e Buffalo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Wanuna loyi wa malembe -ya 30-hi vukulu, loyi a velekiweke eBuffalo, a a ri un’wana wa lava dlayiweke eka ku duvuriwa..."" This directly translates to ""A 30-year-old man, born in Buffalo, was one of those injured in the shooting...""  Therefore, the shooting *happened* in Buffalo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nuna na nsati va ri vambirhi a va huma e Texas** - The passage states they *traveled to* Buffalo, not that they originated from Texas.
* **B: A ku ri ni lava hlaseriweke va ntlhanu** - The passage says 100 people were present, but doesn't give a number of *injured* people.
* **C: Vatekani va tekane hi lembe leri hundzeke e Buffalo** - They traveled *to* Buffalo to meet, but the passage states they were from Texas and the meeting was *in* Buffalo.



"
I swiga swihi leswi nga kongoma malunghana ni laha ku duvuriwa ku nga humelela kona?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku humelele eka nkhuvo wa xitsundzuxo e Buffalo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nkhuvo wa ximfumo wa xitsundzuxo xa vukati xi vekeriwe eka masiku lama nga ta landzela, varhangeri va vurile."" (The investigation into the internal funding scandal will be held in the coming days, reporters said.)  And importantly, it links this investigation to Buffalo, where the shooting occurred.
* **The shooting happened in Buffalo.** The text explicitly states the individuals traveled to Buffalo to meet with officials.
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **B:** While there *is* a financial scandal mentioned, the shooting itself happened in Buffalo, not related to the scandal's location.
    * **C:** Texas is where the victims *came from*, not where the shooting occurred.
    * **D:**  The ""mucato wa vatekani"" (fate of the victims) is a tragic outcome, but doesn't pinpoint the location of the investigation.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini swa ku sungula leswi nga karhata valawuri malunghana ni Luno?","The correct answer is **A: Ku pfumala ka ndzhwalo wa manyoro** (The unloading of cargo).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Xikepe lexi nga 100-mithara lexi a xi nghene endleleni ku ya teka ndzhwalo wa manyorho naswona ekusunguleni varhangeri a va chava leswaku swi ta halaka."" This translates to: ""A 100-meter ship entered the channel to take cargo and initially, the operators were unsure if it would succeed."" 

This directly indicates that the *first* concern for the operators regarding Luno was whether the ship could successfully *unload its cargo*. The rest of the information describes conditions *after* the ship has started the unloading process (strong winds, icebergs, etc.).



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka malunghana ni ku tshoveka ka Luno leswi nga riki ntiyiso?","The correct answer is **A: Ku tshoveka ku humelele ku nga si landziwa ndzhwalo** (The movement occurred without following the load).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Luno a yi ri na 120–160 cubic metres ya mafurwa loko yi tshoveka na mimoya leyi baka ngopfu na magandlati lama yisiweke eka khumbi ro ya sivela."" This implies the movement *happened* despite not being properly secured to the load (the cargo). It moved *with* strong winds and improperly secured ropes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Xikepe a ri ni 100 wa timithara ta mafurha hi nkarhi wa ku tshoveka** - The passage says the *ship* is 100 meters long, not that the shift was 100 meters.
* **C: Eka swirho swa ntlawa swa lava nga khume-mbirhi, i un’we la nga vaviseka** - The passage states *both* ropes broke, not just one.
* **D: Xikepe xi bakanyiriwile eka khumbi ro sivela** - The passage only states the ropes were secured *to* the salvage ship, not that the ship itself was modified for it.



"
Hi le ka khume ra malembe wahi laha Algeria yi nga kuma ntshunxeko?,"The correct answer is **C: Hi va 1960**.

The text states: ""Eka va 1960 u vuyele eAlgeria leyi a yi ya ha ku kuma ntshuxeko a ya dyondzisa vu humelerisi bya tifilimi."" This directly translates to ""In the 1960s he returned to Algeria which was about to gain independence and taught film criticism.""



"
Hi le kwihi laha a ku nga vekiwanga swikrini swa thelevhixini ku kombisa nkosi?,"The correct answer is **A: Eka Rhoma hinkwayo**.

Here's why:

The passage states large television screens were set up *throughout* Rome to allow people to watch the event. This implies screens were *not* present in St. Peter's Square itself, as the passage specifically mentions the huge crowd being *in* the square to witness the event directly.  The other options mention locations *outside* of Rome where similar viewings took place.



"
Hi le kwihi laha nkosi wu nga khomeriwa kona?,"The correct answer is **C: Eka St. Peter’s Square**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...hinkwavo va nghena enkosini le **St. Peter's Square**."" (everyone entered the kingdom at **St. Peter's Square**).  While the event was broadcast and celebrated elsewhere, St. Peter's Square is where the largest gathering took place and where people *entered* the kingdom.



"
"Endzhaku ka ku buluka, i va mani lava nga tshunguriwa ku vaviseka?","The correct answer is **A: Kwalomu ka vanhu va ntlhanu** (About five people).

The text states: ""kwalomu ka vanhu va ntlhanu lava a va ri kwalaho loko ku buluka va tshunguriwe eka swikombiso swa ku chava."" This directly translates to ""about five people who were there when it exploded were investigated for burns.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku hava munhu** (No one) - The text specifically says five people were investigated.
* **C: Mukongomisi wa khamphani ya gasi** (The manager of the gas company) - The text only mentions a technician from the gas company arriving *after* the explosion.
* **D: Muakelani** (The owner) - The text mentions the owner was not at home when the explosion occurred.



"
I mani la nga vika ku pfuta ka gasi?,"The correct answer is **A: Muakelani la tshamaka eka muako**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...loko muakelani a be riqhingho hikwalaho ko pfuta ka gasi."" This translates to ""...when Muakelani was checking for a gas leak.""  This directly links Muakelani to the potential cause of the gas leak.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Munhu la tshamaka eka yindlu (Person checking the house):** The text doesn't mention anyone specifically checking the house *before* the leak.
* **C: Mukongomisi wa khamphani ya gasi (Gas company manager):** The manager arrived *after* the house exploded, to investigate.
* **D: Mufambisi wa muako (Door opener):** This is irrelevant to the situation.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i vanhu va ngani lava feke eka ku hlaseriwa?","The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The text states: ""Lava loveke a ku ri Nicholas Alden, wa 25, na Zachary Cuddeback, wa 21."" This means two people (Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback) were injured in the explosion. 

Therefore, the answer is **B**.



"
I tlhari ra mani leri nga tsandzeka ku duvula hi nkarhi wa ku hlaseriwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Schneider**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Tlhari ra Uka ri tsandzekile tanihi leswi a ri kongomisiwe eka nhloko ya wanuna wa vuntlhanu. Schneider u na xitlhavi lexi hambetaka..."" This directly links Uka's injury to Schneider and describes Schneider's prosthetic enhancements as a result of it. Therefore, Schneider is the one whose skull was damaged, causing the injury.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cuddeback:** The text identifies Cuddeback as a shooter, not someone who was injured.
*   **B: Uka:** While Uka *is* the injury (a skull fracture), the question asks *whose* skull was fractured.
*   **D: Alden:** Alden is simply mentioned as being 25 years old and is not connected to the injury.



"
I mintlangu yihi eka leyi landzelaka leyi nga vhoteriwa ku huma eka nongonoko wa ti Olimpiki?,"The correct answer is **C: Baseball**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Baseball na sofball, leswi susiweke eka Mintlangu Ya Olimpiki hi 2005."" (Baseball and softball, which were removed from the Olympic Games in 2005.)

The question asks which sport is being *voted on to potentially leave* the Olympics. Baseball (and softball) are the only sports mentioned as having been removed before and are now potentially facing further exclusion.



"
I mintlangu yihi eka leyi landzelaka leyi Komiti Ya Tiolimpiki Ta Matiko yi nga vhotela leswaku yi katsiwa eka mintlangu?,"The correct answer is **C: Yuniyoni ya rugby**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Rugby, kahlekahle yuniyoni ya rugby, na golufu ti hlawuriwile eka mintlhangu yin’wana ya ntlhanu leyi nghenelelaka eka Tiolimpiki.""  This means the National Olympic Committee voted to include rugby (specifically union rugby) in the games.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mintlangu yo tirhisa swa ku rhendzeleka** (Sports using demonstrations) - The text mentions these *were* considered, but not voted *for* inclusion.
* **B: Baseball** - The text says baseball was *removed* from the Olympics in 2005.
* **D: Softball** -  Similar to baseball, softball was also *removed* in 2005.



"
Arthur Guinness emasungulweni u hirhise St James’ Gate Brewery hi malembe mangani?,"The correct answer is **C: 1759**.

The text states that Arthur Guinness signed a contract to lease St James' Gate Brewery in **1759**. The other options are incorrect:

* **250** refers to the number of years the brewery has been operating.
* **10** refers to the length of the initial lease (9,000 years is a typo in the original text).
* **9000** is the length of the initial lease, but doesn't tell us *when* he founded it.



"
Hi kwalomu ka tidolara tingani ta tibiliyoni leti Guinness yi ti nghenisaka hi lembe?,"The correct answer is **D: 10**

The text states Guinness generates over **10 billion** euros per year, which is equivalent to US$14.7 billion. The question asks for the amount in billions of dollars."
Hi le ka matiko mangani lama nga eka Yuniyoni ya Yuropa laha xitsongwatsongwana xa H5N1 xi nga kumiwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Ya Nkombo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Furwa i tiko ra vunkombo ematikweni lama nga ehansi ka Ntwanano wa Yuropa...""  This translates to ""France is a country of outbreaks among countries under the European Union...""

Therefore, the outbreak is in **France** (Nkombo in the options refers to France).



"
Hi le kwihi la ku nga va ni xiviko xa le ndzhaku xa ku kumiwa ka xitsongwatsongwana xa H5N1?,"The correct answer is **A: E Furwa**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...ku tlulele sekwa ra le khwatini leri feke, leri kumiweke hi Musumbhunuku, endhawini ya nhlangasi ekusuhi ni le Lyon evuxeni bya **Furwa**."" ( ...was detected in a farm, built by Musumbhunuku, in an area near Lyon in **France**.)
"
Haiti yi hetelele rini ku va ni swiphiqo swa vuvabyi ku nga si hangalaka vuvabyi lebyi nga tisiwa hi vanhu vo tisa kurhula?,"The correct answer is **A: Hi va 1800**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku nga si fika masocha, Haiti a yi nga si tshama yi va na swiphiqo swa vuvabyi ku sukela kwalomu ka va 1800.""  This directly translates to ""Before the soldiers arrived, Haiti had not stopped having cholera problems since the 1800s.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Emahlweninyana ka ku fika ka masocha:** The passage suggests cholera *pre-dated* the arrival of the soldiers.
* **C: Ku nga si va ni ku tsekatseka ka misava:** The earthquake is mentioned as a complicating factor, but not the origin of the cholera issue.
* **D: Hi 2009:** This date is not mentioned in relation to the start of cholera problems.



"
I thyaka leri humaka eka ndhawu yihi leri nga hoxa xandla eka ku hangalaka ka vuvabyi?,"The correct answer is **B: Etikampeni ta masocha ya le UN**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...thyaka ra ti kampa ta UN ari nga basisiwanga kahle, ri endle leswaku switsongwatsongwana swi nghena eka xitsundzuxo xa Artibonite River..."". This directly links the UN camps to the spread of cholera.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Eka Nambu wa Artibonite:** While the Artibonite River was affected, the source of the problem was *from* the UN camps *into* the river.
*   **C: Ndhawu leyi ku nga tsekatseka misava kona hi 2010:** The earthquake created vulnerability, but didn't directly cause the cholera outbreak.
*   **D: Nhlangano ya Vululami na Demokhrasi ya le Haiti:** This organization *investigated* the outbreak, but didn't cause it.



"
Mfumo wa le Ireland wu kunguhata ku endla yini?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku olovisa milawu ya ku pfumeleriwa ka swidzidzirisi** (To review laws regarding the approval of regulations).

Here's why:

* The passage states the government believes parliamentary regulations should be ""expedited.""
* It also mentions concerns about people using outdated regulations and the need to address laws that are ""inconsistent with the constitution"" since changes were made.
* This all points to a need to *review* and potentially change existing regulations – to *olovisa milawu*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku nyika lava tirhisaka swidzidzirisi milandzu** (To give those using regulations instructions) - The passage doesn't mention providing instructions, but rather addressing problems with the regulations themselves.
* **B: Ku simeka milawu yo tika leyi engetelekeke eka ku pfumeleriwa ka swidzidzirisi** (To create accurate laws that build on the approval of regulations) -  The focus is on *existing* laws, not creating new ones.
* **D: Ku endla swidzidzirisi swi va enawini** (To make regulations profitable) - The passage doesn't discuss profitability at all.



"
I yini leyi a yi pfumeleriwa hi nawu hi xinkarhana le Ireland?,"The correct answer is **D: Swidzidzirisi**.

Here's why:

The text states the government is concerned about ""vuhlayiseki bya vanhu lava tirhisaka nawu lowu wa xinkadyana ni **swidzidziharisi leswi katsekaka**"" (the abuse by people using the small law and **hidden practices**) and that changes were made because the previous laws were considered not in line with the constitution. This directly relates to problematic or illegal practices (swidzidzirisi) being done under the cover of the law.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku yiva (Hearing):** The text doesn't mention anything about hearing or listening.
*   **B: Vukanganyisi (Corruption):** While abuse of law *could* lead to corruption, the text specifically focuses on the *practices* themselves, not the corruption.
*   **C: Ku hlasela (Attacking):** There's no mention of physical attacks in the text.



"
Muhehliwa wu le ku kambisisiweni hikwalaho ka yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku nghena emutini wa un’wana handle ka mpfumelelo**.

The text explicitly states the suspect is in custody ""hikwalaho ka nandzu wo nghena emutini wa un’wana handle ka mpfumelelo"" which translates to ""because of entering another person's yard without permission"". 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku onha hi mavoko (Attacking with hands):** This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **C: Ku oheteriwa ka swilo (Being accused of something):** The text describes an action (trespassing), not an accusation.
* **D: Ku yiva (Hearing):**  This is irrelevant to the reason for the arrest.



"
"Loko a cinca mfungho, i yini leswi muhehliwa a nga swi endla?","The correct answer is **A: U cince yin’we ya maletere** (He changes one of the letters).

Here's why:

The passage states the scent was altered by changing an ""O"" to an ""e"" – this is a change of a single letter. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: U khavise hi mfungho wa ku rhula** (He hides it with a calming scent) - While scents were used, the core action was *changing* the scent, not just masking it.
* **C: U onhe hi mavoko** (He touches it with his hands) - The passage doesn't mention any physical touching.
* **D: U tirhise ti tarpaulin ku wu cinca** (He uses tarpaulins to change it) - Tarpaulins were used to *cover* the scent, not change it directly.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi mudyondzisi wa Xinghezi Karno a nga hehliwanga hi swona?","The correct answer is **A: Ku nga landzeleli milawu yo sirhelela swa vutsari** (Failing to follow child protection laws).

The passage specifically states: ""U tlhele a hehliwa hi ku nga landzeleli milawu yo sirhelela swa vutsari, kambe a a nga gweviwangi."" (He was repeatedly warned for failing to follow child protection laws, but was not dismissed.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku rhandzana ni xichudeni** (Having affairs with students) - While the passage implies inappropriate behavior with students (""marito ya xitsotsi etlilasini""), it doesn't explicitly state affairs.
* **C: Ku kandziyisa swinavetisi leswi nga pfumeleriwanga** (Administering unauthorized tests) -  Modern Education reprimanded him for large tests ""handle ka mpfumelelo"" (without success) but that's not the *reason* he was warned repeatedly.
* **D: Ku tirhisa marito yo bola etlilasini** (Using foul language in class) - This is mentioned as something he does, but it's not the reason he was warned/investigated.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani loyi a nga tlhakisiwanga hi Rolando Mendoza?","The correct answer is **B: Maphorisa**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Khale ka phorisa ra le Filipino u tlhakise vapfhumba va le Hong Kong...Rolando Mendoza u duvule vapfhumba hi xibamu xakwe xa M16."" This means Rolando Mendoza shot the *tourists* (vapfhumba) *and* the *police* (phorisa). The question asks who was *not* shot by Rolando Mendoza. While the tourists were shot, the police were also shot.  The text explicitly states Mendoza shot police officers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vapfhumba (Tourists)** - The text clearly states they were shot.
*   **C: Vana (Children)** - The text states children were among those killed.
*   **D: Lava tekaka swifaniso (Photographers)** - The text doesn't say photographers were targeted.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, eka lava tlhakisiweke i vahi lava a ku nga tiyisisiwanga leswaku va ntshunxiwe ku nga si fika nkarhi?","The correct answer is **D: Vana**.

The passage specifically states: ""Vanhu va tsevu lava tlhakisiweke, lava katsaka **vana** ni vanhu lavakulu va ntshunxiwe ku nga si fika nkarhi..."" which translates to ""The victims included **children** and adults who were not rescued in time...""

Therefore, the answer is children.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani la nga hlengeleta minsayino ya ku seketela ku endla vukati bya vanhu va rimbewu rin’we byi va enawini le Brazil?","The correct answer is **A: Vakombisakuvilela** (Activists).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vakombisakuvilela va tshemba leswaku va ta hlengeleta xikombelo xa vona xa minsayino ya 1.2 miliyoni ku xi yisa eka Huvo ya Tiko hi Hukuri."" This directly translates to ""Activists hope to submit their petition of 1.2 million signatures to the National Congress in October."" 

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Roberto Jefferson:** He is mentioned as someone who has the draft law, but not as the one collecting signatures.
*   **Kereke ya Khatholiki ya le Rhoma (The Roman Catholic Church):** The church is mentioned in relation to the law itself, not the petition.
*   **Marta Suplicy:** She authored the original bill, but isn't collecting signatures for it now.



"
Vakombisakuvilela va ta nyika mani xikombelo xa vona?,"The correct answer is **C: Huvo ya Tiko ya Brazil**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Vakombisakuvilela va tshemba leswaku va ta hlengeleta xikombelo xa vona xa minsayino ya 1.2 miliyoni ku xi yisa **eka Huvo ya Tiko** hi Hukuri.""  This directly indicates they plan to submit the petition to the Brazilian government (Huvo ya Tiko).



"
"Hi ku ya hi xiviko xa Armand Versace, i yini leswi nga humelela hi ku kongoma vanhu va nga si sungula ku angula eka maxelo?","The correct answer is **A: Ku sungule xihangu (The start of the storm)**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""...endzhaku ka sweswo ku sungula xihangu, vanhu va chuwile naswona va huwelela va tsustsuma eka ndhawu hinkwayo."" ( ""...then the storm began, people fell and panicked, running everywhere.""). This directly links the beginning of the storm to the people panicking and running for safety.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nkombiso a wu salele endzhaku hi timinete ta ntlhanu (The warning wasn't given quickly enough in 5 minutes):** While the passage mentions a 5-minute warning, it doesn't say *that's* what caused the panic.
* **C: A ku ri ni moya lowukulu (There was a strong wind):**  Strong wind is mentioned, but it's the *storm* itself that causes the chaos, not just the wind.
* **D: U lahlekeriwe hi xirho xa ndyangu (He is missing his sister and her husband):** This is a personal loss mentioned by Armand, but it's not the cause of the widespread panic.



"
"Hi ku ya hi Versace, mimoya leyikulu swinene yi sungule rini?","The correct answer is **A: Timinete to hlayanyana endzhaku ka nkombiso**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Eka timinete ta ntlhanu ta ku kombisa ku sungula ka moya lowukulu..."" which translates to ""At five o'clock, it started with a strong wind..."".  This directly indicates the strong winds began at five o'clock.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Endzhaku ka mpfula (After the rain):** The text says rain *followed* the wind, not the other way around.
* **C: Endzhaku ka ku lahlekeriwa hi sesi wa yena (After losing his wife):** The loss of his wife is mentioned, but it doesn't relate to when the wind started.
* **D: Ku nga si va ni xihungu (It's not mentioned):** The text *does* mention when the wind started.



"
"Emahlweni ka Fred, i mabubutsa mangani lama nga rhekhodiwa evuxeni bya 35°W?","The correct answer is **B: Manharhu**.

The text states: ""...i bubutsa ra vunharhu hi vukulu leri rhekhodiweke evuxeni ra 35°W.""  This translates to ""...it is a regional hurricane with a size recorded in the area of 35°W.""  Therefore, one hurricane has been recorded in that area. ""Manharhu"" means ""hurricane"" in the context of this question.



"
"Loko Fred yi ri ekusuhi ni swihlala swa le Cape Verde, xana a yi kongome ka tlhelo rihi?","The correct answer is **D: En’walungu vupeladyambu**.

The text states: ""Fred i kongome en’walungu vupeladyambu."" (Fred is strengthening in the northwest.) This directly answers the question of where Fred is strengthening relative to Cape Verde.

I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga ni rivilo swinene ku tlula xo sungula?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Rivilo ra 802.11n ri hatlisa ku tlula xitirhisiwa lexo sungula xa mphakelokulu wa 600Mbit/s.""  This directly translates to ""The speed of 802.11n is faster than the original standard with a maximum of 600Mbit/s.""

The question asks which standard has the highest speed. Therefore, 802.11n is the answer.



"
I yini lexi lavekaka leswaku 802.11n yi fambisana ku tlhelela endzhaku na 802.11b?,"The correct answer is **D: Tirhadiyo timbirhi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...even if the device only has a single radio."" This means 802.11n's backwards compatibility with older standards like 802.11b *requires* the ability to use multiple radios (or at least, it works best with them). If it only has one radio, it can't simultaneously communicate on both 2.4GHz (for 802.11b) and 5.0GHz (for 802.11n).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rivilo lerikulu swinene (Larger bandwidth):** While 802.11n *has* larger bandwidth, that's not what enables compatibility with 802.11b.
*   **B: Vuswikoti bya 802.11b ku tirha eka 5.0Ghz (802.11b capability working on 5.0Ghz):** 802.11b operates on 2.4GHz, not 5.0GHz.
*   **C: Mphakelokulu wa 600Mbit/s (600Mbit/s speed):**  This is the *maximum* speed of 802.11n, not a requirement for compatibility with older standards.



"
Hi le ka swiendlakalo swingani laha nhenha ya ti Olimpiki leyi kumeke ti medali ta nsuku a yi fanele yi ya hlambela eka Mintlango ya Commonwealth?,"The correct answer is **B: Swinharhu**.

Here's why:

The passage states the athlete ""a nga swi koti ku nwa maphilisi lama lavekaka leswaku a ta hlula xitlhavi lexi a nga na xona **hikuva va yirisiwile eka mintlangu**."" This translates to ""could not take the necessary pills to overcome the challenge he had because they were banned at the games.""  ""Mintlangu"" refers to the games/competitions, and specifically in this context, the Commonwealth Games.  The passage explains the athlete couldn't compete at the Commonwealth Games due to anti-doping regulations (the pills being banned).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Swantlhanu:** (Five) – Doesn’t relate to the reason for not competing.
* **C: Swimbirhi:** (Two) – Doesn’t relate to the reason for not competing.
* **D: Swa mune:** (Of the body) – While the passage mentions physical suitability, the *reason* for not competing isn't solely about physical fitness, but the doping rule violation.



"
Ha yini nhenha ya ti Olimpiki leyi kumeke ti medali ta nsuku a yi nga swi koti ku nwa maphilisi ya xona hikwalaho ka xitlhavi?,"The correct answer is **D: A swi pfumeleriwanga hi Mintlangu ya Commonwealth** (It is not allowed by the Commonwealth Games).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the athlete was *prevented* from taking necessary medication ""because they were disqualified from the games."" This implies a rule violation, and the context points to the Commonwealth Games' regulations regarding performance-enhancing substances (even if the medication wasn't for enhancement, but for a pre-existing condition).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: A nga ri xitlhavi xihi kumbe xihi** (There was no challenge) - The passage clearly states there *was* a challenge - the athlete's eligibility.
*   **B: A ma n’wi vabyisa** (They bribed him) - The passage doesn't mention bribery.
*   **C: A karhateka hileswaku ma ta khumba ku faneleka ka miri wa yena hi ndlela yo biha** (He was frustrated because they would question his physical ability in a bad way) - While frustration might be present, the *reason* for not being able to take medication is a rule, not just fear of questioning.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi nga ha va ka swi vange ku pfilunganyeka malunghana ni xiendlakalo xa ku tsekatseka ka misava?","The correct answer is **A: Ku va kona ka mapapa ya munyama** (The presence of rock plumes).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mapapa ya munyama lama nga fambisaniki na vholkheno ya voniwile emasungulweni ya ntshava."" (Rock plumes associated with volcanic activity have been detected in the area.)  This directly links the rock plumes to the potential volcanic activity/eruption.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Swiviko ku huma eka Hofisi ya ta Maxelo eIceland** (Information from the Icelandic Meteorological Office) - While the office *provides* information, it's not what's actively causing concern.
* **C: Mepe wa matiko wa ku tsekatseka ka misava** (Map of volcanic activity) - A map shows *where* activity is, but doesn’t explain *why* people are concerned.
* **D: Xiendlakalo lexi nga vikiwa eka tindhawu tin’wana ta Iceland** (An event seen in several areas of Iceland) - The passage focuses on a specific location (Hekla) and a specific indicator (rock plumes), not a widespread event.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ku cinca lokukulu ku humelele rini?","The correct answer is **C: Hi March 10**.

The passage states: ""Ku tseka tseka ka misava loku ku tiseke ku cinca lokukulu ku endleke hi March 10 en’walungu vuxa bya vholkheno summit caldera."" This directly translates to ""The volcanic activity is expected to cause a change in size to conclude by March 10...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Emahlweni ka March 10** - ""Emahlweni"" means ""at the beginning"" but the passage doesn't specify the change will *begin* on March 10, but *conclude* by then.
* **B: Eka tiawara ta 48 leti hundzeke** - This refers to the history of volcanic activity at Hekla, not when the current change in size will happen.
* **D: Eka vhiki leri nga hundza** - The passage mentions a week *before* reaching the conclusion on March 10, but doesn't state the change happens *during* that week.



"
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka malunghana na xilo lexi xa ku ya en’wetini xa Chandrayaan-1 leswi nga riki ntiyiso?,"The correct answer is **D: Xitirhisiwa xa ku ya en’wetini a xi pendiwile ematlhelweni.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...swi cukumete Moon Impact Probe (MIP) ya swona, ...naswona yi tlumbeke kahle kusuhi na nsika ya le dzongeni wa N’weti. Handle ka ku rhwala switirhisiwa swa sayense, swilo leswi swa ku ya en’wetini a swi rhwale na xifaniso xa mujeko wa le Indiya, lowu a wu pendiwe matlhelo hinkwawo.""

This translates to: ""...it deployed the Moon Impact Probe (MIP) which crashed onto the lunar surface at 1.5 kilometers per second (3000 miles per hour), and landed successfully near the lunar south pole. Although it carried scientific instruments, the probe did **not** transmit any images of the Indian flag, which was not fully displayed.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage confirms the probe *did* impact the moon, so it wasn't a failed deployment.
*   **B:** The passage states it *did* carry scientific instruments.
*   **C:** The passage says it ""yi tlumbeke kahle"" (landed successfully), indicating a successful impact.



"
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma xitirhisiwa xa ku ya en’wetini?,"The correct answer is **C: Xi humesiwe eka xitirhisiwa xa ku ya en’wetini leswi nga ni ntlawa wa vanhu.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Handle ka ku rhwala switirhisiwa swa sayense, swilo leswi swa ku ya en’wetini a swi rhwale na xifaniso xa mujeko wa le Indiya, lowu a wu pendiwe matlhelo hinkwawo."" This means it was a robotic mission (no humans) carrying scientific instruments.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Xi fike kahle ekusuhi na nsika ya le n’walungu wa N’weti:** While it landed near the south pole, the passage doesn't *focus* on this as the main point. It's a detail, not the core achievement being highlighted.
* **B: Ku tlumbetiwa ka xona ku ve loku humelelaka:**  The passage states it *impacted* the moon, which isn't necessarily a success – it was intentionally designed to crash. The success lies in the data gathered *before* impact.
* **D: A xi rhwale switirhisiwa swimbirhi swa nkoka:** The passage mentions ""switirhisiwa swa sayense"" (scientific instruments) generally, but doesn't specify a number or highlight their importance.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i magoza mahi ya nsirhelelo lama nga ta tirhisiwa ra ku hetelela ku lwisana ni vuvabyi?","The correct answer is **C: Mintlhavelo ya encephalitis yo sivela mavabyi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Timiliyoni ti nga ri tingani ta mintlhavelo yo sivela mavabyi yi tshembisiwile hi hulumendhe..."" This directly translates to ""Millions of doses of encephalitis vaccine are promised by the government...""  Encephalitis is a disease spread by mosquitoes, making the vaccine a protective measure against the mosquitoes (and therefore the vuvabyi - mosquitoes).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Swodlaya switsotswana** - These are mentioned as being *carried* by the mosquitoes, not as a protective measure.
* **B: Vakhomi va tinguluve** - The passage talks about the government being concerned about mosquito breeding, not using the breeders for protection.
* **D: Tinete ta tinsuna** - These are what the mosquitoes are *attacking*, not a protective measure.



"
Vuvabyi byi tlulela njhani eka vanhu?,"The correct answer is **C: Tinguluve**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mavabyi ma fambisiwa hi tinguluve, laha ma hundzelaka eka vanhu ku ya fika eka tinsuna."" This directly translates to ""The mosquitoes are carried by planes, where they spread to people to reach the larvae."" 

Therefore, planes (tinguluve) are the method of transmission mentioned in the text.



"
Ku tsandzeka ka xigwevo xa vumbirhi ku nga va ni vuyelo byihi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku kuma mfanelo eka vumundzuku ya ti yuniyoni leti yimelaka ku hlangana ka rimbewu leri fanaka hi swa masangu** (Giving rights to unions representing workers in similar industries).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku tsandzeka ka xigwevo xa vumbirhi, lexi ringanyetaka ku herisa ti yuniyoni leti yimelaka ku hlangana eka rimbewu leri fanaka hi swa masangu, swi nga pfulela ti yuniyoni leti eka vumundzuku."" This directly translates to ""The passing of the second bill, which aims to strengthen unions representing workers in similar industries, could benefit unions in organizing.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku kambisisiwa hi xihatla ka HJR-3** (Being reviewed by the state through HJR-3) - The passage mentions HJR-3 will be *considered* later, not that the bill's passing is about HJR-3 review.
*   **C: Eka nhlangano wa ku veka milawu wa xihatla** (At the state law-making assembly) - This is too general and doesn't address the specific impact of the bill.
*   **D: Ku yirisiwa ka ti yuniyoni leti yimelaka ku hlangana ka rimbewu leri fanaka hi swa masangu** (Weakening unions representing workers in similar industries) - The passage states the bill *strengthens* unions, not weakens them.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ha yini xigwevo xa vumbirhi xi susiwile?","The correct answer is **A: Hi nkarhi wa nhlangano wa ku veka milawu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ku cinca ku endliwile eka xiyenge lexi xa nawu loko xigwevo xa vumbirhi xi susiwile ku sungula hi ntlawa wa Vayimeri naswona wu pase hi ndlela leyi fanaka hi Senate Monday."" This translates to ""Changes were made to the section when the second amendment was **suspended during the legislative session** and passed similarly by the Senate Monday."" 

Therefore, the second amendment was suspended *during the legislative session* (or when laws were being made).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hi 2011** - 2011 is when the original issue was brought up, not when the amendment was suspended.
*   **C: Hi Musumbhunuku** -  There's no mention of a month in the text.
*   **D: Hi 2015** - 2015 is when a new law might be considered to reinstate it, not when it was initially suspended.



"
I mani loyi ku nga paluxiwa “Panama Papers” eka yena?,"The correct answer is **A: Khamphani ya Mossack Fonseca**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the ""Panama Papers"" were leaked *from* the law firm Mossack Fonseca. The papers revealed information about how this firm helped clients move money.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Swihaxa mahungu** - The leaks were *published* by various media outlets (like The Guardian), but not *from* them.
*   **C: Bangi ya Deutsche** - Deutsche Bank was involved in *managing* some of the accounts, but wasn't the source of the leak.
*   **D: Varhangeri va mfumo wa Iceland** - These individuals were *affected* by the revelations in the Panama Papers, but didn’t originate the leak.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani loyi swihaxa mahungu swa le Britain swi nga vula leswaku a fambisa tikhamphani to tala ku tumbeta rifuwo?","The correct answer is **C: Bangi ya Deutsche** (Deutsche Bank).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Phephahungu ra le Brithani ku nga The Guradian ri ringanyete leswaku **Deutsche Bank yi lawula kwalomu ka n’wexanharhu xa tikhampani leti nga tiviwiki ta 1200 ku endla sweswo.**"" (The British newspaper The Guardian reported that Deutsche Bank managed a network of over 1200 companies to do so.)

This directly identifies Deutsche Bank as the entity managing the companies used to hide wealth.
"
I tinghozi tihi ta swihaha-mpfhuka eka leti landzelaka laha ku feke vanhu vo tala?,"The correct answer is **A: Nghozi ya xihaha-mpfhuka lexi a xi ya le Armenia xi suka eIran**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""N’weti leyi hundzeke Iran ri vone ngozi leyi tekeke malembe loko xihaha mpfuka lexi a xiya eArmenia xi wa, xi dlaye vakhandziyi va 168."" (This month Iran saw a disaster that broke records when a plane heading to Armenia crashed, killing 168 passengers.)

This clearly identifies the flight to Armenia as the incident with the highest loss of life (168 people). The other options refer to incidents with fewer deaths or are simply descriptions of plane crashes without specifying a high number of fatalities.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki xivangelo xa ku tala ka tinghozi ta swihaha-mpfhuka leti nga humelela le Iran?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku nga hlayisiwi kahle ka swihaha-mpfhuka** (Poor maintenance of aircraft).

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""...swihaha mpfhuka ti tele ngopfu eIran, leyi nga na swihaha mpfhuka swa khale swo famba hi vanhu ni swa nyimpi naswona **a swi hlayisiwi**."" (Aircraft are common in Iran, with old aircraft used for passenger and military transport, and **they are not well maintained**.)  This directly links the prevalence of crashes to a lack of maintenance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Swihaha mpfhuka swa khale swo famba hi vanhu ni swa nyimpi** (Old aircraft used for passenger and military transport) - While true, this doesn't *explain* why crashes are happening, just that old planes are in use. Age alone isn't the problem; maintenance is.
* **B: Ku pfumaleka ka mali ya ku pfumelela ku xaviwa ka swihaha-mpfhuka leswintshwa** (Lack of funds to allow for the acquisition of new aircraft) - The passage doesn’t mention funding issues as the cause.
* **C: Milawu yo xupula ya matiko leyi nga tiyisekisa leswaku swihaha-mpfuka leswintshwa a swi nge xaviwi** (National laws ensuring that new aircraft are not allowed) - This is the *opposite* of the problem. The laws are trying to prevent the use of unsafe aircraft, but the issue is the existing, poorly maintained ones.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga katsiwanga eka xiviko xa Iraq Study Group?,"The correct answer is **B: Xitiviso xa ku ri loko ku ri ni ku cinca kun’wana, madzolonga lama engetelekaka le Iraq ma nga papalatiwa** (A mention of the possibility of changes, that Iraqi sectarian violence should be curtailed).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ku hava loyi a nga nyikaka xitiyisiso xa leswaku goza rihi ni rihi ra Iraq sweswi ri ta herisa nkwetlembetano sweswi ri ta yimisa nkwetlembetano wa mpambukwa, madzolonga lama engetelekaka, kumbe mboyamelo wo pfuxa hasahasa.""  This directly translates to ""no one can guarantee that any future Iraqi government will curtail sectarian violence, reduce insurgent activity, or prevent widespread chaos.""  This means the report *acknowledges* the issue of sectarian violence (madzolonga lama engetelekaka) and the *need to curtail it*, but doesn't explicitly state that curtailment *is* guaranteed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku xopaxopiwa ka pholisi leyi nga kona** (Criticism of current policy) - The passage *does* say the report is heavily critical of existing US policy.
*   **C: Swibumabumelo swa ku sirhelela mindzilakana ya Iraq** (Recommendations to protect Iraqi civilians) - The passage states the need to protect Iraqis from attacks, which aligns with this.
*   **D: Xikombelo xa ku simekiwa ka ntwanano eUnited States** (A call for national unity in the United States) - The passage explicitly mentions a request for a national dialogue in the US.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga khuthaziwi hi Iraq Study Group eka xiviko xa yona?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku tirhisa nkanerisano wa mani na mani**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Xiviko xi rhanga hi xikombelo xo va ni nkanerisano wa mani na mani hi ku simekiwa ka ntwanano eUnited States malunghana ni pholisi ku ya eMiddle East."" This directly translates to ""The report recommends a comprehensive approach involving discussions with anyone to establish a consensus in the United States regarding policy towards the Middle East.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku nga vuriwa xitiyisekiso xa ku heta madzolonga lama engetelekaka** - The passage states the report finds *no one* can guarantee the end of sectarian violence.
*   **B: Ku cinca nkongomiso hi xihatla** - The passage mentions changes in tactics but doesn't specifically emphasize a complete shift in strategy.
*   **D: Ku simekiwa ka goza lerintshwa ra vudipulomatiki** - While a new diplomatic effort is suggested (78 recommendations), the main emphasis is on broad consultation.



"
"Hi ku ya hi maphorisa, i mani la nga tekiwa tanihi xandla xa Provenzano?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maphorisa ma vule leswaku Lo Piccolo a ri na matimba swinene hikuva a a ri xandla xa Provenzano le Palermo..."" (Police revealed that Lo Piccolo was very powerful because he was the hand of Provenzano in Palermo...).

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Giovanni Falcone & Paolo Borsellino:** They were victims of the Mafia, not Provenzano's ""hand"".
*   **Ansa:** Ansa is the name of the reporter, not someone connected to Provenzano in this context.



"
"Hi ku ya hi rungula leri nga nyikeriwa eka ndzimana, a ku ri yini xivangelo xa ku fa ka Falcone?","The correct answer is **A: U dlayiwile hi nkarhi wa nyimpi leyi a yi hlohloteriwa hi Riina**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...vakulukumba lava vitaniwile hi Provenzano loko a herisa nyimpi leyi a yi hlohloteriwa hi Riina ku lwisana ni mfumo leyi tekeke vutomi bya valweri va Mafia ku nga Giovanni Falcone na Paolo Borsellino hi1992."" 

This directly translates to: ""...those who collaborated with Provenzano when he unleashed the war that was ordered by Riina against the state which took the lives of Mafia fighters such as Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992.""

Therefore, Falcone's death was a result of the war initiated by Riina.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki swin’wana swa masagwadi ya Hitoshi Saito?,"The correct answer is **C: Muhluri wa ti medali ta nsuku timbirhi ta Tiolimpiki** (A three-time Olympic medalist).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mutlangi wa Judoka wa Japani Hitoshi Saito, **muhluri wa ti Olimpiki timbirhi ta ti medali ta nsuku**, u file eka malembe ya 54."" (Japanese Judoka Hitoshi Saito, **a three-time Olympic medalist**, died at the age of 54).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nhenha ya Misava kambirhi** (Two Olympic appearances): While he was involved with the Olympics, the passage doesn't state he *participated* in only two.
*   **B: Muleteri wa komiti ya All Japan Judo Federation** (Member of the All Japan Judo Federation): The passage states he *was* a member at the time of his death, but this isn't a defining characteristic of his past achievements.
*   **D: Mutivi wa Judo** (Judo Practitioner): This is true, but doesn’t highlight his most notable accomplishment—his Olympic success.



"
Hi le kwihi laha lwasaki a koteke ku balekela ku endla swihlambanyo?,"The correct answer is **B: E Nepal**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""U balekeke vukati le Nepal kutani a ya khomiwa le India."" (He escaped *through* Nepal and then was captured in India). This means Nepal was the country he fled *from* to begin his escape.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E Japani:** The text doesn't mention Japan.
*   **C: E Indiya:** He was *captured* in India, not where he started his escape.
*   **D: E Tibet:** He was imprisoned in Tibet, not where he fled from.



"
I mani la nga hlasela lwasaki?,"The correct answer is **C: Mbyana**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""u hlaseriwile le Tibet hi mbyana leyi a yi ri ni rihuhu"" which translates to ""he was attacked in Tibet by a wild animal.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Loyi swi nga endlekaka a va munghana wa yena wa vukati** - This is irrelevant to the question.
*   **B: Vayivi** - The passage says he was *captured* by robbers, not attacked.
*   **D: Maphorisa** - The passage doesn't mention police attacking Iwasaki.



"
Alonso u tshike rini mphikizano wa yena?,"The correct answer is **C: Endzhaku ka loko Schumacher a tshike mphikizano wa yena**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Michael Schumacher u tshike mphikizano wa yena ku nga ri khale endzhaku ka Alonso..."" which translates to ""Michael Schumacher crashed out of the race shortly before Alonso...""  This directly links Alonso's crash to Schumacher's earlier crash.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Endzhaku ka loko Schumacher a nga onha vhilwa ra yena ra le mahlweni** - While Schumacher's car was damaged, the text says Alonso crashed *after* Schumacher crashed, not because Schumacher damaged his car.
*   **B: Fisichella a nga swi kotanga ku lawula movha wa yena** - Fisichella's car control issue is mentioned, but it doesn't relate to when Alonso crashed.
*   **D: A nga si rhanga** - The passage provides information about *when* Alonso crashed.



"
I yini leswi nga vanga leswaku Schumacher a tshika mphikizano wa yena?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku tlumbana na Alonso** (Due to colliding with Alonso).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Michael Schumacher u tshike mphikizano wa yena ku nga ri khale endzhaku ka Alonso, hileswi sasipenixini a yi onhake eka tindhawu to tala hi nkarhi wa mphikizano.""  This directly translates to ""Michael Schumacher retired from the race shortly after Alonso, while his mechanic was not happy with many positions during the race.""  This indicates Schumacher retired *because* of the incident with Alonso.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A nga swi kotanga ku lawula movha wa yena** - This describes Fisichella's retirement, not Schumacher's.
* **C: Ku ohnaka ka vhilwa loku nga vangiwa hi Fisichella** - This also relates to Fisichella's situation, and a problem with his car.
* **D: Ku onhaka ka sasipenixini ya movha** - While the mechanic was unhappy, this doesn't explain *why* Schumacher retired. It just states the mechanic's reaction.



"
"Hi ku hi ndzimana, i ntirho wa mani ku ntshunxa vakhotsi?","The correct answer is **B: Muavanyisi Glynn**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ku humesiwe xileriso xa nkarhinyana xa ndziriso hi Muavanyisi Glynn eka xivandla lexi ku sindzisa ku ntshunxiwa ka lava khomiweke ku tlula tiawara ta 24 tiawara endzhaku ka ku khomiwa ka vona laha ku nga amukeriwangiki ntshamo wa khoto."" 

This directly translates to: ""...a small amendment to the regulations was introduced by Investigator Glynn at the facility to reduce the detention of those arrested more than 24 hours without a court appearance.""  

Therefore, Muavanyisi Glynn is the one responsible for the action to release detainees.



"
"Hi ku ya hi xileriso xa nkarhinyana xa ku sivela lexi nga vuriwa eka ndzimana, vakhotsi va fanele va pfumeleriwa ku va na yini leswaku va khomiwa ku hundza tiawara ta 24?","The correct answer is **C: Swihehlo swa le nawini leswi nga nyikeriwa hi Muavanyisi Glynn**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Muavanyisi Glynn issued a temporary order requiring ""proof of bail"" to prevent those arrested from being held longer than 24 hours without a court appearance. This ""proof of bail"" are the ""swihehlo swa le nawini"" (certain records/details) that judges need to have.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Beyili:** While bail is related, the passage specifies *proof* of bail is needed, not just the bail itself.
*   **B: Nhlangano na mutirhela mfumo loyi a khomaka vanhu:** The passage doesn't mention any relationship or organization needed.
*   **D: Ku yinigiseriwa ka nandzu ehubyeni:**  While data entry is mentioned, it's a *result* of the proof being provided, not the requirement itself.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xivangelo lexi nga tirhisiwangiki ku hlamusela ku lwisana?","The correct answer is **A: Makhombo ya vusirheleri** (Security concerns).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ku sivela khombo ra vusirheleri eka nhlawulo wu’nwana."" (…to address security concerns regarding the withdrawal.) This directly links security concerns to the disagreement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku lwetana ka vumbiwa** (Constitutional agreement) - The passage mentions disagreement *about* achieving a constitutional agreement, not the agreement itself being the cause of the disagreement.
* **C: Swikoxo leswi tlakukeke swa nhlawulo** (Complicated withdrawal agreements) - While the withdrawal *is* complicated, the passage points to security concerns as the core issue.
* **D: Ku kanakana hi vumbiwa** (Negotiations on the constitution) - Similar to B, this is about the *process* of reaching an agreement, not the reason for the disagreement.



"
Hikwalahokayini vatirhelamfumo va hetelele va langute ku lwisana ku nga laveki?,"The correct answer is **A: A ku nga fambisani ni vumbiwa** (It doesn't align with the constitution).

Here's why:

The passage states the diplomats found the agreement ""loku nga lavekiki"" (unacceptable) because it didn't align with the Afghan constitution (""ku twisisa ku lwetana loku nga lavekiki"").  This is the direct reason given for their opposition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: A ku ri ni makhombo ya vusirheleri** (There are no costs of incompetence) - While the passage mentions costs, it's not the *reason* for rejecting the agreement.
* **C: A ku ri ni ku kanakana hi vumbiwa** (There is no investigation of the constitution) - The diplomats *did* investigate the constitution, finding the agreement incompatible with it.
* **D: Nhlawulo a wu koxa mali yo tala swinene** (The penalty doesn't cost a lot of money) -  The cost of the penalty isn't the core issue; the constitutionality is.

I mani loyi a phamelaka vukorhokeri bya vuavanyisi eka FATA?,"The correct answer is **B: Vayimeri va Politiki**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Vayimeri va Politiki...va nga na ntirho wa ku nyiketa vukorhokeri bya mfumo ni bya vuavanyisi ehansi ka Tsalwa 247 ra Vumbiwa bya Pakistani."" This directly translates to ""Political Agents...had the responsibility of providing administrative and investigative powers under Article 247 of the Pakistani Constitution.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hulumendhe ya Pakistani:** While the Pakistani government ultimately held authority, the passage specifies that *Political Agents* were the ones directly exercising the investigative powers.
*   **C: Muungameri wa Pakistani:** The passage mentions the Governor of Pakistan authorized the Political Agents, but didn't directly exercise the powers themselves.
*   **D: Hulumendhe ya Britain:** The British government's role ended in 1947 with the partition.



"
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki ntiyiso malunghana ni “Vayimeri va Politiki” va FATA?,"The correct answer is **B: Va hlawuriwe hi muungameri wa Pakistani** (They were appointed by the Governor of Pakistan).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Muunagmeri wa Pakistani u hlawule “Vayimeri va Politiki”"" which translates to ""The Governor of Pakistan appointed the ""Political Agents"""". 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Va phamela vukorhokeri bya vuavanyisi** (They carried out investigative functions) - While they *did* have functions related to investigation, this isn't the defining characteristic of their appointment.
*   **C: Va namarhela vumbiwa bya Pakistani** (They upheld the constitution of Pakistan) - The passage doesn’t state they upheld the constitution, but that they operated *under* a specific article of it.
*   **D: Va lawula tindhawu to karhi hi ku helela** (They controlled areas by traveling) - The passage mentions indirect rule, but doesn't specifically state they controlled areas *by traveling*.



"
Hi wihi nkutlunya lowu Emma Stone a langiweke eka wona?,"The correct answer is **B: Mukongomisi wo Famba Emahlweni** (Costume Designer for La La Land).

The text states: ""Gosling na Stone va langiwile eka Mutlangi wo Famba Emahlweni havumbirhi. Ku langiwa kun’wana ku katsa Xifaniso Lexi Fambaka Emahlweni, **Mukongomisi**, Sinemathogirafi...""  This means Emma Stone was nominated for Costume Design.

Therefore, the answer is B.



"
Hi wihi nkutlunya lowu filimi yi nga langiwangiki eka wona?,"The correct answer is **D: Risimu ro Rhanga ro Famba Emahlweni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku langiwa kun’wana ku katsa Xifaniso Lexi Fambaka Emahlweni, Mukongomisi, Sinemathogirafi, Vumaki Bya Swiambalo, ku Sasela Filimi, Nkutlunya wo Sungula, Vumaki bya Vuhumelerisi, ku Sasela Mpfumawulo, ku Pfanganisa Mpfumawulo ni ku Tlanga Exikirinini ko Sungula.""  This means the film *was* nominated in all those categories *except* for the Rising Star Award (Risimu ro Rhanga). It’s stated that the two scenes, Odixini and Dorobakulu of Stars were nominated for the opening scene award.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi yeke emahlweni xi tirha endzhaku ka ku tsekatseka ka misava?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti-reactor hinkwato ta xitichi xa Hokuriku Shika**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hokuriku Electric Power Co. yi vike leswaku a ku nga ri na ku cinca loku ku vangeriweke hi ku tseka-tseka ka misava naswona swilawuri swa nomborho 1 na 2 eka xitici xa nyutliliya xa le Shinka xi pfariwile.""  This directly translates to ""Hokuriku Electric Power Co. reported that there were no changes due to the earthquake and reactors number 1 and 2 at the Shika nuclear power plant were shut down.""  ""Ti-reactor hinkwato ta xitichi xa Hokuriku Shika"" means ""all reactors of the Hokuriku Shika plant"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: xitichi xa swihahampfhuka xa Ishikawa:** While the Noto Peninsula's Mpfhuka Swihaha (Swihaha Mpfhuka) station was shut down, the question asks about what was affected *by the earthquake*. The station shutting down is a consequence, not the direct effect.
*   **C: Vukorhokeri hinkwabyo bya xitimela:** The text mentions railway lines were disrupted, but this is a consequence of the earthquake, not something directly *affected* by the earthquake's shaking.
*   **D: xitichi xa gezi xa Niigata:** The text refers to homes without water in Niigata, but not a nuclear plant.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi onhakeke hikwalaho ka ku tsekatseka ka misava?","The correct answer is **B: Ti-reactor timbirhi xa xitichi xa Shika**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""swilawuri swa nomborho 1 na 2 eka xitici xa nyutliliya xa le Shinka xi pfariwile"" (reactors number 1 and 2 at the Shika nuclear power plant were shut down). This directly links the shutdown to the earthquake.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Makaya yo karhi** - The passage mentions 9400 homes without power, and 100 with gas leaks, but doesn't connect this *directly* to the earthquake causing the reactors to shut down.
*   **C: Mapato yo karhi** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: xitichi xa Swihahampfhuka xa Noto** - The passage states this plant *was not* affected (""xi pfariwile"" means it was not affected).



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka timhaka leti landzelaka hi yihi lexi nga katsiwangiki etsalweni leri?","The correct answer is **B: Xivangelo xa nyimpi ya 1967**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Palesitina yi swi lavaka loko va sekela ni mindzilikano ya 1967...** (Palestine wants to base any agreement on the 1967 borders). This directly references the 1967 war as a foundational point.
* The passage *doesn't* explain *why* the 1967 war happened, only that the 1967 borders are important for negotiation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vumundzuku bya Yerusalema:** The passage *mentions* the status of Jerusalem, but doesn't delve into the details of the dispute itself - only that it's a contested issue.
* **C: Vukona bya masocha enkoveni:** The passage *mentions* the Israeli desire for a long-term military presence in the Jordan Valley, but doesn't explain the *reason* for this desire.
* **D: Ku lwetana hi mindzilakano:** The passage describes negotiations based on the 1967 borders, but doesn't explain the overall goal or details of these negotiations beyond that specific point.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga laviwiki hi Palestina?,"The correct answer is **C: Tinhlamulo malunghana ni vumundzuku bya Yerusalema** (Issues regarding the status of Jerusalem).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Tinhloko mhaka tin’wana leti nga ta tlhuvutsiwa i vumundzuku bya Yerusalema leri kwetsimaka eka matiko hamambirhi..."" (One of the main issues to be discussed is the status of Jerusalem, which is claimed by both countries...).  This directly highlights Jerusalem's status as a key sticking point for Palestine.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mindzilakano leyi veke kona ku nga si fika nyimpi** (Agreements that do not exist before the war) - While the passage mentions agreements *after* 1967, it doesn't focus on agreements *before* a war.
* **B: Ku hambeta masocha ma ri kona eka Nkova wa Yoridani** (The presence of soldiers in the Jordan River) - The passage talks about the *withdrawal* of soldiers from the Jordan River, not their presence.
* **D: Vukona bya masocha ku ringana malembe ya ntlhanu eka Nkova wa Yoridani** (The presence of soldiers for five years in the Jordan River) -  This refers to a specific Palestinian Authority proposal, but the passage highlights it as a *disagreement* point, not something Palestine generally seeks.



"
Xana Ma u dyondze ta nawu eka tiko rihi?,"The correct answer is **A: United States of America**.

Here's why:

The text states Ma studied at the University of New York *and* Harvard Law School. Both of these are located in the United States of America. While Ma was born in Hong Kong, the question asks where they *studied*, and the text clearly indicates the USA.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i ku va ni ntirhisano ni tiko rihi leswi pfuneke Ma ku hlula eka nhlawulo?","The correct answer is **D: China**.

Here's why:

The passage states Ma had to successfully navigate the path of cooperating with the **Chinese government** (""ntikokulu ra China""). This implies the challenge of the trial (nhlawulo) revolved around his relationship and dealings with China. While he has a green card for the US, the passage specifically mentions navigating relations with China as the key to his success in the trial.



"
"Hilaha swi boxiweke hakona eka xiyenge lexi, xana Carolyn Wilson a a tirhela mani a nga si suka edorobeni?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...leswaku Carolyn Wilson wa OHA a a yive tidipoziti ku khomisa ta vona, ivi a baleke edorobeni.""  This directly translates to ""...that Carolyn Wilson of OHA did not show up for depositions to face them, and then fled the city."" 

Therefore, Carolyn Wilson works for (or is associated with) OHA.



"
"Leswi ku saleke mimphikizano ya mune eka nguva leyi, i mani loyi a nga eka nomboro ya vumune eka Driver’s Championship?","The correct answer is **C: Stewart**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Stewart, Gordon, Kenseth, na Harvick va le ka swiyenge swa khume leswi nga le henhle swa Drivers' Championship hi mimphikizano ya mune leyi nga sala enguveni.""  This directly translates to ""Stewart, Gordon, Kenseth, and Harvick are in a difficult position for the Driver’s Championship with the remaining races.""  This implies Stewart *could* still move up, while the others mentioned (Hamlin, Kahne, Bowyer) are already positioned well or are explicitly described as being behind.



"
"Endzhaku ka mphikizano lowu boxiweke eka xiyenge lexi, i mikutlunya yingani leyi Kahne a nga na yona eka Driver’s Championship?","The correct answer is **D: 2207**.

The text states: ""Kahne na Truex, Jr. va le ka vuntlhanu na tsevu hi ku landzelelana naswona va ni mikutlunya ya 2,220 na 2,207.""  It specifically says Kahne has 2,220 and Truex Jr. has 2,207. The question asks for Kahne's points, which are 2,220. However, the question asks how many points Kahne has **less** than Keselowski, whose points are 2,250. Therefore, 2,250 - 2,220 = 30.

My apologies, I misread the question. The question asks how many points Kahne has in the Driver’s Championship.  The text states Kahne has **2,220** points. I incorrectly focused on the difference between Kahne and Keselowski.

Therefore the answer is **A: 2220**."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i kangani laha vanhu va voneke ti-meteorite leti waka leti endzhaku ti vonakeke ti huma e-Mars?","The correct answer is **C: Ka khumentlhanu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku pfumeriwa leswaku i nkarhi vuntlhanu laha vanhu va xiyeke leswi tiyisisiweke leswaku i swilo swa Mars leswi weleke emisaveni."" This translates to ""It is believed that for the fifth time, people have identified things from Mars falling to Earth."" 

Therefore, people have identified meteorites from Mars **five times** (khumentlhanu means five).



"
"Hilaha swi boxiweke hakona eka xiyenge, hi wihi ntiyiso malunghana ni maribye lama kumekeke ma huma e-Mars?","The correct answer is **D: Ku na 34 wa tona** (There are 34 tons).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Eka ti-meteorites ta kwalomu ka 24,000 leti tiviwaka leti weleke emisaveni, i 34 wa tona ntsena leti ku tiyisekisiwaka leswaku ti huma eMars."" This directly translates to: ""Of the 24,000 meteorites that have fallen to Earth, 34 tons have been confirmed to come from Mars.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hinkwaswo swi kumeke hi nkarhi wa ku wa ka ti-meteorite hi July** (Everything happened during the meteorite fall in July) - This is too specific. While a recent find was linked to July, the overall discovery of Martian meteorites has happened over time.
*   **B: Ku na 24,000 wa tona** (There are 24,000 tons) - The passage states 24,000 *meteorites*, not 24,000 tons of Martian material.
*   **C: Ti ni ntsengo wa $11,000 ku tlula nsuku** (It costs $11,000 more than a day) - This refers to the price of some meteorites, not a general scientific finding about the meteorites themselves.



"
Xana Schumacher u tshika rini ntirho?,"The correct answer is **A: Endzhaku ka ku vaviseka ka Felipe Massa**.

Here's why:

The passage states Schumacher *left* his job in 2006 *because* Felipe Massa became available. This means Massa's arrival (and the need for a teammate) was the reason for Schumacher's departure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Endzhaku ka ku hlula mphikizano wakwe wa vunkombo** - The passage says he left *before* fully finishing his career, not because he won.
* **C: Endzhaku ko siva Felipe Massa** - The passage doesn’t say Schumacher left to watch Massa.
* **D: Eku heleni ka nguva ya 2009** - The passage refers to events in 2006 and 2009, but Schumacher's departure was in 2006.



"
Xana Massa u vaviseke rini?,"The correct answer is **A: Hi nkarhi wa Grand Prix**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Muburazili u xanisiwe hi mbanga ya le nhlokweni endzhaku ko wa eka 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix."" This directly translates to ""The Brazilian was injured by a head injury during the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix."" 

Therefore, Massa was injured *during* a Grand Prix.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Endzhaku ko hlula mphikizano wa Formula 1:** The text doesn't say he was injured while *winning* the Formula 1 championship.
* **C: Emahlweni ko tshika ntirho ka Schumacher:**  The text mentions Schumacher's retirement, but it's not related to Massa's injury.
* **D: Emahlweni ka nguva ya 2009:** While the injury happened *in* 2009, the specific context is the Grand Prix event, not just any time during the year.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana lunghiselelo leri ri ta yi khumba njhani AOL?","The correct answer is **C: Nhlayo ya vatirhisi yi ta phikizana ni vatirhisi va Yahoo na Microsoft**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the combined user base of Yahoo! and Microsoft will *compete* with AOL's user base. This directly implies that AOL will face competition from these larger combined groups.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nhlayo ya vatirhisi va AOL swi nga endleka yi tlakuka** - While possible, the passage doesn't explicitly state that AOL's user base will decline, only that it will be competing.
* **B: AOL yi ta va yona ntsena khampani leyi sunguleke vuxaviselo bya IM** - The passage states AOL *was* the first, but doesn’t indicate this will change.  Being first doesn't guarantee future success against competitors.
* **D: AOL a yi nge he tirhisiwi eUnited States** - The passage specifically states AOL is widely used in the United States.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi swihi leswi nga tshukaka swi hela eku heleni ka lunghiselelo leri?,"The correct answer is **C: Ntshunxeko wa AOL wo hluvukisa vuxaviselo hi rivilo ra yona** (AOL's ambition to develop its own messaging system).

Here's why:

The passage states that if AOL hadn't been successful in being first to market and developing IM, ""this situation would not have existed."" This directly links the *failure* of AOL's own development efforts to the current competitive landscape. The passage suggests AOL's ambition to create its own IM service is what drove the subsequent competition (Yahoo/Microsoft vs. AOL).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nhluvukiso wa inthanete lowu anameke eUnited States** (The development of the internet in the United States) - While important context, it's not the specific *failure* that would have prevented the situation described.
*   **B: Ku tirhisiwa ka vuxaviselo bya IM** (The use of IM messaging) - The use of IM messaging *happened*, it wasn't something that *wouldn't* have happened.
*   **D: Ku tirhisana ka Yahoo na Microsoft** (Collaboration between Yahoo and Microsoft) - This is a *result* of the situation, not the condition that would have prevented it.



"
I vanhu vangani lava dlayiweke eka nhlaselo lava a va nga ri maphorisa?,"The correct answer is **A: 19**.

Here's why:

The text states the bombing killed two police officers *and* injured ""more than 19 others."" This means 19+ people were injured who were *not* police officers. 

Therefore, the answer is 19."
I mani loyi a vikeke muehleketeleriwa eka nhlaselo lowu?,"The correct answer is **A: Maphorisa**.

Here's why:

The text states ""tolo nimixo ivi yi dlaya maphorisa mambirhi naswona yi vavise vanhu van’wana vo tlula makumembirhi"" (this bomb injured two police officers and wounded more than 18 people).  It also says police suspect Daesh militants carried out the attack *against them* (""va sola leswaku vahlohloteri va nyimpi va Daesh (ISIL) hi vona va endleke nhlaselo lowu"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hofisi ya mulawuri (Prosecutor's Office):** The prosecutor's office *investigated* the attack, they weren't the targets.
*   **C: Vaviki va mahungu (Foreign nationals):** While others were injured, the text specifically highlights the police officers as those directly attacked.
*   **D: Vaaki va le Gaziantep (People of Gaziantep):** While civilians were wounded, the attack was directed *at the police*.



"
"Hikwalaho ka leswi Florida a ri langutiwa ri ri mfumo lowu nga nhenha, xana Mitt Romney u nyikiwe ku hlula kwihi?","The correct answer is **B: Nhlawulo wa Republican Party**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Florida's win ""catapulted Romney ahead as the frontrunner for the Republican Party nomination."" This means he won a significant advantage in the race *within the Republican Party* to become their presidential candidate. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 32 wa vayimeri va mfumo** - The text says Gingrich received 32% of the votes, not that Romney won 32 delegates.
*   **C: Vayimeri hinkwavo va mfumo** - The passage doesn't state Romney won *all* the state's delegates.
*   **D: 46 wa tiphesente ta tivhoti** - Romney received 46% of the votes, but the question asks about what he *won* due to this result, which is the leadership position within the party.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i tiphesente tingani ta tivhoti leti Gingrich a nga na tona eka nhlawulo lowukulu?","The correct answer is **B: 32 wa tiphesente**.

The passage states: ""Newt Gingrich u ve wa vumbirhi hi ti phesenti ta 32."" (Newt Gingrich came in second with 32 percent.)
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi a tshikeke ku va emphikizanweni wa nhlawulo endzhaku ka vuyelo bya nhlangano?","The correct answer is **C: Perry**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Perry u vule leswaku a ta “tlhelela le Texas ku ya kambela vuyelo bya nhlangano wa madyambu lawu, ku kumisisa loko ku ri ni ndlela ya leswaku ndzi ya emahlweni eka mphikizano lowu”, kambe endzhaku u vule leswaku a a ta tshama emphikizanweni eka xiyengekulu xa January 21 eDzongeni ra Carolina.""

This translates to: ""Perry announced that he would “return to Texas to reassess the campaign, clarifying whether there is a path forward for me to compete in this contest,” but then announced that he would not compete in the January 21 contest in South Carolina.""

Therefore, Perry is the one withdrawing from the race.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi a ndhundhuzeleke muyimeri un’wana endzhaku ka vuyelo bya nhlangano?","The correct answer is **B: Gingrich**.

The text states: ""Endzhaku ka loko vuyelo byi humile, Gingrich u ndhundhuzele Santorum..."" which translates to ""After the vote, Gingrich targeted Santorum..."" This means Gingrich attacked another candidate after the results were in.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bachmann** - The text says she ""took a step to revive her campaign"" but doesn't say she targeted another candidate.
*   **C: Romney** - Gingrich was targeted *by* Romney (as Romney had strong support in Iowa), but Romney didn't target anyone in this excerpt.
*   **D: Perry** - Perry considered withdrawing, but ultimately decided to continue; the text doesn't say he targeted anyone.



"
Hi yihi ndhawu yin’we ntsena laha nongonoko wu kombisiweke eka yona emahlweni ka 2015?,"The correct answer is **A: TogiNet Radio**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Khale swinene nongonoko lowu a wu haxiwa ntsena eka xitichi xa khale lexi tlangaka eka inthanete lexi vuriwaka **TogiNet Radio**...""  This directly states that the content was first shown on TogiNet Radio before 2015.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: East Texas** - East Texas is where the DJs were located, not where the content was originally broadcast.
*   **C: AstroNet Radio** - AstroNet Radio was created *in* 2015, so it couldn't be where it was shown before 2015.
*   **D: Switichi swa xiyanimoya swa ndhawu** - The passage doesn't mention local radio stations.



"
Xana switichi swi hlamusela leswaku nongonoko wu ve ni nkucetelo wihi?,"The correct answer is **C: Maendlelo ya xikhale**.

Here's why:

The passage states the website describes the station as a ""mintlango ya rhadiyo ya xikolo xa khale"" which translates to ""old school radio station.""  It emphasizes that it *doesn't* have new or modern trends (""nga ni maendlelo lamantswa ni lama hlekisaka""). This directly points to the station having **old/traditional trends** (Maendlelo ya xikhale).



"
I yini leswi David Headley a swi kumeke leswi eku heteleleni swi pfuneke eka nhlaselo wa masocha?,"The correct answer is **C: Vatameri va swibamu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""David Headley eka vuvalangi ni ku simekiwa u pfune eku tirheni ka pfhumba ra vavanuna va 10 lava a va hlome hi swibamu ku suka eka ntlawa wa masocha wa le Pakistan ku nga Laskhar-e-Taiba."" 

This translates to: ""David Headley was convicted and sentenced for his role in plotting with 10 men who were armed and came from a military group in Pakistan called Laskhar-e-Taiba."" 

Therefore, David Headley helped coordinate the *armed attackers* (vatameri va swibamu) who carried out the attacks.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rungula** - (Meaning ""plan"" or ""scheme"") While Headley was involved in planning, the question asks what he *provided* to the attackers.
*   **B: Tigirenadi** - (Meaning ""grenades"") The text doesn't mention Headley providing grenades.
*   **D: Swibalesa swa othomethiki** - (Meaning ""automatic weapons"") While automatic weapons were used, the text doesn't directly state Headley provided them. It states he helped coordinate the *people* who were armed."
Xana i vutleketli bya muxaka muni lebyi ntlawa wa masocha wu byi tirhiseke ku ya le Mumbai?,"The correct answer is **C: Xikepe**.

The text states: ""Vahlaseri va le Mumbai va fike hi **xikepe** hi November 26, 2008..."" (The attackers arrived in Mumbai by **ship** on November 26, 2008...).

Therefore, the attackers used a ship to reach Mumbai."
Hi wahi marito lama kombisaka kahle vuyelo bya ntlangu wa Nadal na Raonic le Brisbane Open lowu boxiweke eka xiyenge lexi?,"The correct answer is **A: Raonic u hlule Nadal** (Raonic defeated Nadal).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Ku nga ri khale u hluriwile hi Raonic eka Brisbane Open."" This directly translates to ""He was recently defeated by Raonic at the Brisbane Open.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Raonic a ri ni mikutlunya ya 88%** - The text says Nadal had 88% first serve percentage, not Raonic.
* **C: Nadal u hlule Raonic** - This is the opposite of what the text says.
* **D: Raonic u kume mikutlunya ya 76** - The text states Nadal hit 76 first serves.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xiyimo xa ntlangu wa Nadal na Raonic a xi ri xihi endzhaku ka sevhe yo sungula?","The correct answer is **B: Nadal u hlule mikutlunya ya 76**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nadal u kume 88% wa mikutlunya eka mikutlunya ya 76 yo hlula ntlangu eka sevhe yo sungula."" This directly translates to ""Nadal won 76% of the points on the first serve.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Raonic a ri ni mikutlunya ya 88%** - The text says Nadal had 88% of points, not Raonic.
* **C: Xikoro a xi ri 7-2** - This refers to the overall head-to-head record, not the specific match being discussed.
* **D: Raonic u hlule Nadal** - The text doesn't state Raonic won; it says he *defeated* Nadal in a previous tournament (Brisbane Open), but this passage focuses on a different match.



"
Hi wihi nongonoko wa ririmi lowu nga katsiwangiki eka vuhaxi byinharhu lebyintshwa bya Naked News?,"The correct answer is **C: Xijapani**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ana se wu vike hi Xinghezi ni Xijapani..."" which translates to ""And it will be viewed in English and Japanese...""  This means Japanese is one of the new languages being added to Naked News.

The other options are mentioned as languages for *other* platforms (Spanish, Cantonese, and Korean), not the initial viewing platforms.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi kwihi laha vuhaxi lebyintshwa bya Naked News byi nga taka byi nga kumeki kona?","The correct answer is **B: Inthanete**.

Here's why:

The passage states the expansion will include ""web"" platforms (which are part of the internet) alongside television and phone platforms.  ""Inthanete"" is the Shangaan word for internet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tifoyini (Phones):** While mentioned, the question asks where *new* expansion is happening, and the internet is specifically highlighted as a new area.
*   **C: Titiyetha (Theater):**  The passage doesn't mention theaters.
*   **D: Thelevhixini (Television):** Television is mentioned, but it's not the *new* area of expansion; it's already being used.



"
I vaphikizani vangani lava tsandzekeke ku heta Giant Slalom?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

The text states: ""Vatlangi va mune va ku rheta eayisini eka ntlawa wa vavasati va tsandzeke ku heta ntlangu, naswona **45 eka 117** wa vatlangi eka Xihontlovila Slalom va tsandzekile eka ntlango."" 

This directly answers the question about how many competitors finished the Giant Slalom (Xihontlovila Slalom).



"
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi kombisaka kahle vuyelo bya mimphikizano ya Mitlangu ya Vunhenha?,"The correct answer is **B: Vatlangi va skiya va 45 a va hetanga rhengu ra vona eka Giant Slalom**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""45 eka 117 wa vatlangi eka Xihontlovila Slalom va tsandzekile eka ntlango."" (45 out of 117 skiers in the Xihontlovila Slalom did not finish the race). This clearly indicates that 45 skiers did *not* complete the Giant Slalom.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage says Carpenedo had a ""Did Not Finish"" in Slalom, not that they placed well in another competition.
* **C:** The passage provides information about both Slalom and Giant Slalom, but doesn’t allow us to conclude which had more participants finish.
* **D:** Carpenedo did *not* finish the Slalom, so they couldn’t have placed well in it.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi NBA yi endleke xiboho xo xi yimisa?,"The correct answer is **A: Nguva ya basketball** (Basketball season).

Here's why:

The passage states the NBA *suspended the basketball season* due to COVID-19 concerns. The other options are details *within* the reason for the suspension, but not what was actually suspended.

* **B** and **C** identify specific people/teams - they are causes, not the action taken.
* **D** is too specific; it's a location, not the overarching thing suspended.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi vangeleke ku vilela ka NBA malunghana ni xitsongwatsongwana?","The correct answer is **D: Mutlangi wa Utah Jazz u kumiwe a ri ni xitsongwatsongwana**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""loko mutlangi wa Jazz wa le Utah a kumiwe a ri ni xitsongwatsongwana xa COVID-19.""  This directly answers the question of what caused the NBA to take action regarding the illness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the NBA *had* players with the illness, that's a result, not the initial cause of the action.
* **B:** This focuses on players *testing* positive, but the passage highlights the *discovery* of the first case.
* **C:** This is too specific about *how* the player felt. The core issue is the positive test.



"
I mani loyi a huwiseke golo yo hlula ya Washington Capitals eka ntlangu wa vona na Atlanta Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **D: Alex Ovechkin**.

The passage states: ""Mpfuneto wo rhanga wa Ovechkin madyambu wolawo a wu ri wa golo leyi hluleke ntlangu hi mutlangi loyi a sungula ku nghena Nicklas Backstrom..."" This means Ovechkin scored the game-winning goal, assisted by Nicklas Backstrom.



"
I mani loyi a huwiseke golo yakwe ya vu-60 ya nguva eka ntlangu wa Capitals vs. Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The text states: ""Golo ya vumbirhi ya madyambu wolawo a yi ri yakwe ya vu-60 eka nguva ya kona..."" which translates to ""Ovechkin's second goal of the game was his 60th of the season..."" 

Therefore, Alex Ovechkin is the one who scored his 60th goal of the season in the Capitals vs. Thrashers game. Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr are mentioned as others who *achieved* this before, but they didn't score the goal in *this* game. Nicklas Backstrom assisted on a goal, he didn't score it.



"
Hi rini laha bangi ya Northern Rock yi laveke mpfuno wa hulumendhe?,"The correct answer is **A: Endzhaku ka loko bangi yi ve ehansi ko lawuriwa hi hulumendhe**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bangi ya Northern Rock yi sungule ku lawuriwa hi hulumendhe hi 2008 endzhaku ko tshuburiwa leswaku bangi leyi yi kume mpfuno wa xihatla lowu humaka eka hulumendhe ya UK."" This directly translates to ""Northern Rock bank started to be nationalized by the government in 2008 just before it was announced that the bank needed financial aid from the UK government.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** This happens *after* the government takeover.
*   **C:** Virgin Group's attempt to buy the bank happened before the government takeover, but wasn't the reason for the bailout.
*   **D:** The text mentions risky lending, but this was the *cause* of the situation, not when the bailout request was made.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi hlamuselaka kahle ku tirhisana ka Virgin Group swin’we na bangi na Northern Rock?","The correct answer is **A: Virgin Group yi tlhele yi xava khampani ya vufambisi bya rifuwo ya Northern Rock**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Virgin yi xave ntsena ‘bangi ya kahle’ ya Northern Rock, ku nga ri khampani ya vufambisi bya rifuwo."" This directly translates to ""Virgin eventually bought Northern Rock's 'good bank', which was a mortgage company.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage says Virgin tried to buy the *whole* bank initially, before it was nationalized, not after.
*   **C:** The passage doesn't mention financial support; it focuses on the attempted purchase.
*   **D:** While Virgin did attempt to buy it, the passage emphasizes the eventual purchase of the ""good bank"" *after* nationalization, making A the more complete and accurate answer.



"
"Hilaha swi boxiweke hakona eka xiyenge lexi, hi rihi tiko leri khumbiwaka hi sayiniwa ka ntwanano wa maxelo wa Kyoto?","The correct answer is **A: United States**.

The passage states: ""Xiboho xa Nkul. Rudd xo sayina xiboho xa ntwanano wa Kyoto xi vekela etlhelo United States..."" (roughly translates to ""Mr. Rudd's signing of the Kyoto Protocol represents the United States...""). 

Therefore, the United States is the country mentioned as signing the Kyoto Protocol in this excerpt."
Khale ka hulumendhe ya Australia a yi ehleketa leswaku ku amukeriwa ka ntwanano wa Kyoto a ku ta onha yini?,"The correct answer is **B: Ikhonomi ya tiko** (The country's economy).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hulumendhe ya khale ya le Australia yi arile ku amukela Kyoto, ku vuriwe leswaku ntwanano wolowo a wu ta onha ikhonomi tanihi leswi yi titshegeke swinene hi ku rhumela malahla eka matikomambe...""  This directly translates to: ""The former Australian government was afraid to accept Kyoto, it was said that the agreement would harm the economy as it would be severely damaged by sending money to other countries...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: United States:** While the passage mentions the US, the question asks what Australia feared *would happen* if they accepted the Kyoto Protocol.
*   **C: Ku rhumeriwa ka malahla eka matiko mambe:** (Sending money to other countries) This is *a consequence* of the economic harm, not the harm itself.
*   **D: Tipakani leti vekiweke malunghana ni ku thyakisiwa ka moya:** (Agreements regarding air emissions) This describes the *nature* of the Kyoto Protocol, not Australia's fear about accepting it.



"
Vaduvuri va swiharhi a va hirhiwe ku nghenela nongonoko wihi?,"The correct answer is **D: Nongonoko wo hlota wa Sporting Shooters Association**.

The text specifically states: ""...vanhu lava tirhaka hi ku tirhandzela lava wu dyondzeleke va komberiwile, ehansi ka nongonoko wa ku hlota wa Sporting Shooters Association"". This directly links the shooters' involvement to the Sporting Shooters Association's shooting scheme.



"
Hi xihi xivulwa lexi nga kombisiki hi ku kongoma ndzingeto wo lawula switsotswana?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku hlawuriwe vaduvuri va mune**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""vanhu vo sungula va mune vo duvula lava hlawuriweke eka ku duvula ko sungula va nyikiwe vuleteri..."" This translates to ""experienced hunters were given preference...""  This directly addresses the idea of prioritizing certain hunters.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tanihileswi a ku ri ndzingeto wo rhanga wa nongonoko, a wu kamberiwanga** - The passage doesn't mention a lack of a formal policy. It discusses *how* preference is given, not that there *isn't* a policy.
* **B: Vaduvuri va amukele swiletelo swa ndzetelo** - The passage doesn't mention hunters accepting additional challenges.
* **C: Vaduvuri a va vekiwa tihloko hi vasirheleri** - The passage doesn’t discuss whether or not hunters are monitored by rangers.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, ku avana ku kumiwe kwihi?","The correct answer is **D: Le Ethiopia**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Berhane Asfaw, mulavisisi wa le **Rift Valley Research Service aEthiopia** tlhelo un’wana wa vatsari va nkambisiso."" This directly links the discovery (ku kumiwe) to Ethiopia. While the Rift Valley is mentioned, it's *within* Ethiopia in this context.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Eka Rift Valley:** The Rift Valley is a *location* within Ethiopia, not where the discovery itself happened.
*   **B: Eka masalela ya le maribyeni:** The passage talks about discoveries *from* fossils found in rivers, but doesn't say that's where the current finding is.
*   **C: Eka vumbhoni bya timolekhuli:** The passage contrasts this discovery *with* molecular evidence, not stating it was found *in* it.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi endlekeke hi xihatla ku tlula leswi a swi languteriwile?","The correct answer is **A: Ku kumiwa ka masalela ya le maribyeni** (The formation of fossils in sediments).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""P: ...leswi swi vula leswaku ku hambana ku endleke khalenyana ku tlula leswi a swi ehleketiwa hi vumbhoni bya timolekuli.""  This translates to ""...it suggests that differences emerge earlier than predicted by molecular evidence.""  Then it clarifies *what* is emerging earlier: the fossils found in sediments.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku avana** (To be born/to emerge) - This is too general and isn't specific to the context of the passage.
* **C: Ku kamberiwa ka vumbhoni bya molekhuli** (Molecular evidence) - The passage says differences are *earlier* than what molecular evidence suggests, not that molecular evidence itself is emerging.
* **D: Ndzavisiso le Rift Valley** (Rift Valley Research) - This refers to the organization doing the research, not what is emerging earlier.



"
I yini lexi mutlangi a faneleke ku xi endla ku lawula leswi endliwaka eka ntlangu wa vhidiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku fambisa xo lawula emoyeni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Leswi swi ta endla vatlangi va lawula swilo leswi endliwaka eka mintlango ya vhidiyo hi ku **fambisa xitirhisiwa emoyeni**."" This directly answers the question of how a player controls the game.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku tiyisisa leswaku tisensara ta mulawuri ti le kusuhi ni xitirhisiwa xo lawula** - While sensors are important, the passage focuses on *what the player does* to control the game, not sensor placement.
*   **B: Ku yi endla yi vonake ka nharhu** - This describes *what the system does* (makes it appear on the screen), not *how the player controls it*.
*   **C: Ku veka tisensara ekusuhi ni thelevhixini** - This is about the system setup, not player control.



"
I yini lexi endliweke ku languteka tanihi rhimoti ya thelevhixini?,"The correct answer is **A: Tisensara timbirhi ta mulawuri**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku fana na rhimoti ya thelevhixini, switirhisiwa leswi swi tirhisa **tinsensara timbirhi leti vekiwaka ku suhi na thelevixini**...""  This directly links the functionality *of* the remote to the two sensors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Xilawuri xa Nintendo Revolution:** The passage describes a *controller* for the Revolution, not the console itself.
* **C: Mbulavulo lowukulu:** While innovative, the passage doesn't highlight this as the primary point of comparison to a TV remote.
* **D: Xitirhisiwa xo lawula xa Nintendo Revolution:**  This is too broad.  The *sensors* are the specific part being compared to a TV remote's functionality.



"
I yini lexi a xi nga boxiwanga eka xiviko xa sweswinyana xo huma eka vaviki va mahungu va le Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **B: Xihahampfhuka xi phatsame eÜrümqi** (The outbreak originated in Ürümqi).

Here's why:

The text states the outbreak *was alerted to* areas reaching Ürümqi, meaning it started *before* reaching Ürümqi. It doesn't say it *originated* there. The text focuses on its spread *from* Ürümqi towards Afghanistan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Xihahampfhuka xi xungutiwile hi bomo** (The outbreak is caused by life/living beings) - The text doesn't mention the *cause* of the outbreak, only that it threatens life.
*   **C: Xihahampfhuka xi hambukisiwile xi ya eAfghanistan** (The outbreak was transmitted to Afghanistan) - The text clearly states the outbreak *reached* Afghanistan.
*   **D: Xihahampfhuka xi phatsame eKandahar** (The outbreak occurred in Kandahar) - The text states the outbreak *reached* Kandahar, but not that it originated there.



"
I yini lexi a xi nga boxiwanga eka xiviko xo rhanga xa vaviki va mahungu va Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **B: Xihahampfhuka xi a aleriwile ndhawu yo phatsama ya xilamulela mhangu** (The animal was alerted to a sensitive area of the border control).

Here's why:

The passage states the animal *was* alerted *to* an area to reach for border control in Ürümqi. The question asks what wasn't reported in the initial report. The initial report focused on the animal being discovered and its journey *to* Afghanistan, not the specifics of *why* it was alerted or what the purpose of that alerting was.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Xihahampfhuka xi tlhakisiwile** (The animal was discovered) - This *is* reported in the initial report.
*   **C: Xihahampfhuka xi hambukisiwile xi ya eAfghanistan** (The animal travelled to Afghanistan) - This *is* reported in the initial report.
*   **D: Xihahampfhuka xi kume nxungeto wa bomo** (The animal posed a threat to life) - This *is* reported in the initial report.



"
I yini leswi tivisiweke hi Sara Danius eka nongonoko wa xiyanimoya?,"The correct answer is **A: Muhluri wa Sagwadi ra Nobel ra Matsalwa** (The mystery of the Nobel Prize in Literature).

Here's why:

The passage states Sara Danius explained the committee struggled to reach Bob Dylan *regarding the awarding of the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature*. She described their efforts to contact him, highlighting the difficulty they faced. This directly relates to the ""mystery"" surrounding the prize and their attempts to connect with the laureate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Komiti a yi amukelanga nhlamulo eka vanyiki va swibumabumelo** (The committee did not receive responses from those responsible) - While the passage indicates difficulty in getting a response *from Dylan*, it doesn't mention issues with those *responsible* for him.
*   **C: Lava langiweke va 2016 eka Sagwadi ra Nobel ra Matsalwa** (Those nominated in 2016 for the Nobel Prize in Literature) - The passage focuses on Dylan, the *winner*, not the nominees.
*   **D: Komiti yi ta yimisa matshalatshala yo tihlanganisa na Bob Dylan** (The committee will stop efforts to contact Bob Dylan) - The passage doesn't say they're stopping, only that they struggled previously.



"
I mani loyi swi nga kotekangiki ku n’wi fikelela?,"The correct answer is **D: Bob Dylan**.

Here's why:

The passage states the committee struggled to *reach* Bob Dylan after he won the Nobel Prize in 2016. The whole point of the passage is about the difficulty in contacting him.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mutirhikulobye wa le kusuhi wa Bob Dylan:** While they were contacted, the issue was reaching *Bob Dylan* himself.
*   **B: Sara Danius:** She was *trying* to reach someone, she wasn't the one being unreachable.
*   **C: Swedish Academy:** The Swedish Academy is the body trying to make contact, not the person being contacted.



"
"""I mani loyi a vuleke leswaku xiboho xexo """"a ku ri pakani”?""","The correct answer is **C: Gordon Johndroe**.

The passage states: ""Muvulavuleri wa Bush ku nga Gordon Johndroe u vule xihlambanyo xa North Korea """"a ku ri pakani yo fikelela ku herisiwa ka matimba ya nyutliwa..."""""". This directly translates to ""Bush's spokesperson, Gordon Johndroe, released a statement from North Korea """"a ku ri pakani..."""".

Therefore, Gordon Johndroe is the one who released the statement.



"
Xana Slania u endle switempe swingani swa matiko you hambanahambana?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku tlula 1,000** (More than 1,000).

The text states: ""U endle switempe swo tlula 1,000 swa Sweden na 28 swa matiko man’wana."" This translates to ""He created more than 1,000 Swedish stamps and 28 from other countries.""  Therefore, he created more than 1,000 stamps total from different countries.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi lexi nga tshukaka xi vangele ku pfuta loku hambetaka ka timbhovo ta thangi?","The correct answer is **B: Ku kamberiwa loku tolovelekeke ka xo tima ndzilo** (The freezing of ground due to thawing).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku tsemeka ka gezi endzhaku ka ku kamberiwa loku tolovelekeke ka xo tima ndzilo ku vangela tiphayiphi leswaku ti pfuleka...""  This directly links the thawing ground (due to permafrost) to the buckling of the tanks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku tatiwa swinene ka ndhawu ya vumbirhi ya vuhlayiselo** (Excessive settling of the surrounding area) - While settling might be a factor, the passage *specifically* highlights the thawing ground.
*   **C: Ku ndlandlamuka ka nsimbi** (Corrosion of metal) - The passage doesn't mention corrosion.
*   **D: Ndzilo eka xin’wana xa switichi swa tipompo swa Fort Greely** (Ice on one of the Fort Greely pump stations) - This is mentioned as a location where a leak occurred, but not as the *cause* of the tank buckling.



"
Hikwalaho ka yini tiphayiphi ti pfulekile?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku ve na ku ndlandlamuka ka nsimu endzeni ka mathangi** (There was ground movement under the tanks).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...timbhovo ta thangi a ta ha pfuka kumbexana hikwalaho ka ku kukumuka endzeni ka thangi."" This directly translates to ""the tank supports were not aligning because of movement under the tanks."" This movement caused the pipes to fail.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku ve na ku tsemeka ka gezi endzhaku ko kambela xitrhisiwa** (There was freezing due to cold weather) - While Alaska is cold, the text doesn't link the failure *directly* to freezing.
* **C: Mathangi a ma tele swinene** (The tanks were too big) - The text doesn't mention the size of the tanks as a problem.
* **D: Ndhawu ya vumbirhi ya vuhlayiselo a yi nga swi koti ku tamela tibarele leti ringaneke** (The second layer of insulation couldn’t hold the required barrels) - The text doesn’t mention insulation problems.



"
"Sweswi, mati ma tlakuke ku fikela kwihi eka Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **C: Ku fika exisutini**.

Here's why:

The text states that the Ninth Ward ""sweswi yi ni mati lama fikeke exisutini"" (was completely flooded) despite the levee being designed to prevent that.  This means the water reached a level that fully submerged the area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 20 wa tifiti:** This refers to the depth of the water during Katrina, not the current situation.
* **B: 6 wa tiinci:** This refers to the amount the Corps of Engineers are studying, not the water level.
* **D: 100 wa tifiti:** This refers to the measurement of the levee's protection, not the water level itself.



"
"Hi nkarhi wa Bubutsa ra Katrina, ku endleke yini hi Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **B: Mati yo fika exisutini ma tlule mpimo**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""sweswi yi ni mati lama fikeke exisutini tanihi leswi mpimo wa le kusuhi wu taleke ku tlurisa."" This directly translates to ""it had floodwaters that exceeded the highest measurement.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mati yo ndhambi a ma aname 100 wa tifiti** - While the passage mentions damage up to 100 feet, it doesn't state the *depth* of the water was 100 feet. It refers to damage *reaching* that height.
* **C: Mati ya ndhambi a ma tlakuke 20 wa tifiti** - The passage specifically mentions 20 feet in the context of a previous flood, but doesn't state that's the depth of the water during Katrina.
* **D: Mpfula ya 6 wa tiinci yi tlule mpimo lowu onhakeke** - The passage mentions 6 inches of rain, but the main issue was the *floodwaters*, not the rain itself exceeding measurements.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga tiyisisiwangiki hi Hamilton?,"The correct answer is **C: Loko kumbexana maendlelo lama faneleke ma landzeriwile** (Whether proper procedures were followed).

Here's why:

* **The passage states Hamilton confirmed the university *accepted* the patient under strict conditions.** This implies Hamilton verified the hospital followed protocols for handling a potential Ebola case (isolation, preventing spread, etc.).
* The passage explicitly mentions the hospital *followed* procedures for controlling the spread of the disease.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Laha muvabyi a yeke kona (Where the patient came from):** The passage mentions Nigeria, but Hamilton didn't *confirm* this location; it's stated as a fact.
* **B: Leswaku muvabyi a nga tshuka a ngheniwa hi xitsongwatsongwana (That the patient wasn't infected with the virus):** The passage says there have been *cases* of Ebola in Nigeria, implying the patient *could* be infected, and that’s why precautions are being taken. Hamilton doesn’t confirm the patient *isn’t* infected.
* **D: Xiyimo xa sweswi xa muvabyi (The patient's current condition):** The passage doesn't provide any information about the patient's health status.



"
I nchumu wihi lowu va n’wasayense va lavaka ku wu twisisa?,"The correct answer is **D: Ndlela leyi Misava yi endliweke ha yona**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Va n’wasayense va navela ku twisisa ndlela leyi tipulanete ti endlekaka ha yona, ngopfu-ngopfu ndlela leyi misava yi sunguleke ha yona, ku sukela loko maribye ya le mpfhukeni ya tlumbane na Misava khale ngopfu.""  This translates to: ""Scientists are striving to understand how planets are formed, especially how galaxies originated, since the early building blocks of the universe collided with galaxies a long time ago.""

The core focus of the scientists' investigation, as stated in the passage, is *how galaxies are formed*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the collision is *related* to galaxy formation, it's not the main thing they're trying to understand. It's the *result* of a process, not the process itself.
*   **B:** The passage mentions proteins but focuses on the origin of galaxies, not how proteins are made.
*   **C:** ""Leswi swilo swa ntumbuluko swi nga swona"" (what those building blocks are) is less important than understanding *how* they came together to form galaxies.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i xiphemu xihi lexi maphorisa ya ndhawu ma xi hetisiseke eku pfariweni?","The correct answer is **C: Va kongomise vachayeri va mimovha eka ndlela yin’wana**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""maphorisa ya 80 a va pfuna vanhu va nghena hi ndlela yin’wana."" This directly translates to ""80 police officers stopped people entering via another route.""  This indicates the police focused on intercepting drivers (vachayeri va mimovha) using an alternate route (ndlela yin’wana).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Va hlohlotele FBI ku pfala** - While the FBI initiated the operation, the passage focuses on *what the police did* in response.
* **B: Va endle xiboho xo pfala hi voxe** -  There's no mention of a roadblock being set up.
* **D: Va vike ku hlwela ka mimovha eka ndlela yo hambuka hayona** -  The police *stopped* people, they didn't just watch them go by on a different road.



"
Ku endleke yihi hi vungheno bya tindlela ta chubu hi nkarhi wa ku pfariwa,"The correct answer is **B: A ti tirhisiwa tanihi ndlela yo hambuka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tilori to rwala misava ti tirhisiwile ku pfala tindlela to nghena..."" which translates to ""Trucks spreading gravel were used to block access roads...""  This directly means the roads were used to *prevent* access, effectively making them unusable as a route for travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A ti pfariwile** (They weren't closed) - The passage clearly states gravel trucks were used to *block* roads.
* **C: A ti pfuleriwile vachayeri va mimovha** (They weren't monitored by vehicle operators) - The passage doesn't mention monitoring by vehicle operators.
* **D: A ku ri ni ku hlwela ka mimovha ekusuhi na tona** (There was vehicle damage near the toll) - The passage doesn't mention vehicle damage or a toll.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga endlekangiki emahlweni ko va muteki wa swifaniso a chayisiwa hi movha?","The correct answer is **A: Muteki wa swifaniso u lerisiwile hi Highway Patrol ku va a humela etlhelo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""hikuya hi maphorisa, muchayeri wa movha lowu chayiseke muteki wa swifaniso a swi tikombi leswaku a nga hehliwa hi ku vekiwa nandzu."" and ""phorisa ra California Highway Patrol leri kongomisaka mimovha leswaku ri n’wi lerisa ku humela etlhelo, kambirhi."" This directly translates to the highway patrol stopping the photographer for speeding/running a red light.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While true, it doesn't explain *why* he was stopped.
* **C:** This is an action *leading up to* the stop, not the reason for it.
* **D:** This is unrelated to the reason he was stopped by police.



"
Xana muteki wa swifaniso a ringeta ku endla yini a nga si chayisiwa hi movha?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku yimisa movha wakwe eka Sepulveda Boulevard**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""muteki wa swifaniso u yimise movha wakwe etlhelo ka Sepulveda Boulevard ivi a ringeta ku teka swifaniso swa maphorisa..."" This directly translates to ""the photographer stopped his car on Sepulveda Boulevard intending to take pictures of the police..."" 

The other options are actions *after* he stopped the car and are what led to the issues with the police, not the initial reason he wasn't allowed to continue.



"
Hi xihi xivulwa lexi nga xi hlamuseliki hi ku kongoma xiyimo xa muungameri endzhaku ko kumiwa a ri na xitsongwatsongwana?,"The correct answer is **A: A nga titwi kahle**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Handle ka mukhuhlwani na nkolo lowu vavaka, ndzi titwa ndzi ri kahle naswona ndzi le ka xiyimo xa kahle leswaku ndzi tirha hi riqhingho."" This translates to ""Despite the injury and the prayer, I feel well and am in good condition to work efficiently.""  The phrase ""ndzi titwa ndzi ri kahle"" directly addresses feeling well *despite* the injury.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: U twa ku vava ka nkolo (He received prayer)** - While prayer is mentioned, it doesn't explain *how* he's feeling better. It's a contributing factor, not the explanation.
* **C: U le ka xiyimo xo antswa (He is in a bad condition)** - The passage explicitly states he is in *good* condition.
* **D: U ni mukhuhlwani (He has an injury)** - The injury is stated, but it doesn't explain the improvement in his condition.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi ta muungameri hi xihi lexi nga ntiyiso?","The correct answer is **A: A nga na mukhuhlwani**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Handle ka mukhuhlwani na nkolo lowu vavaka, ndzi titwa ndzi ri kahle naswona ndzi le ka xiyimo xa kahle leswaku ndzi tirha hi riqhingho.""  This translates to: ""Despite the pain and the prayer he offered, I feel well and am in a good condition to work with efficiency."" This directly indicates he *has* pain (mukhuhlwani).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: U ta tshama ekaya mavhiki ma nga ri mangani** - The passage says he won't be able to return home for a long time, but doesn't specify *how* long.
* **C: U hanye kahle lerova a nga kota ku vulavula hi riqingho** - While he's able to work efficiently, the passage doesn't state he was severely injured. It mentions pain, but not to the extent of hindering speech.
* **D: Wa tikeriwa swinene hikwalaho ka xitsongwatsongwana** -  The passage mentions the accident but focuses on his recovery and ability to work, not extreme distress caused *by* the accident itself.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana Xidzedze xa Gonu a xi languteriwe ku ya emahlweni xi hunguteka rini?","The correct answer is **B: Loko moya wu hunguteka rivilo ku fika eka 83 wa tikhilomitara hi awara**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Namuntlha nimixo, mheho wa kona a wu ri kwalomu ka 83 wa tikhilomitara hi awara naswona ku languteriwe leswaku wu ya emahlweni wu hunguteka.""  This directly translates to: ""Currently, the wind is blowing at 83 kilometers per hour and it is predicted to strengthen further.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Emahlweni ko fika eMaldives:** The text says it *arrived* in the Maldives, but doesn't state it strengthened *when* it arrived.
* **C: Xi nga si fikelela nhlohlorhini ya xona:** This means ""We cannot reach the center of the cyclone"" which isn't what the text is discussing.
* **D: Xi nga si fikelela rivilo ra moya wa 149 wa timayili hi awara:** The text mentions a peak wind speed of 149 mph, but doesn’t say it strengthened *to* that speed. It specifies strengthening *from* 83 km/h.



"
Xana mimoya a yi ri eka rivilo rihi loko Xidzedze xa Gonu xi fikelela nhlohlorhi ya xona?,"The correct answer is **C: 149 wa timayili hi awara**.

Here's why:

The question asks for the wind speed *when* Xidzedze xa Gonu reaches the peak of the storm. The passage states: ""...xi fike eka mheho lowu hungaka hi rivilo ra 240 wa tikhilomitara hi awara (149 wa timayili hi awara).""  This directly gives the wind speed at the peak – 149 miles per hour.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 149 wa tikhilomitara hi awara** - This is a wind speed mentioned, but it's the *current* speed, not the peak.
*   **B: 240 wa timayili hi awara** - This is the speed in kilometers per hour, not miles per hour, and also represents the peak speed in km/h.
*   **D: 83 wa tikhilomitara hi awara** - This is a different wind speed altogether, describing the storm's movement.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki mukhuva wa Karenia brevis?,"The correct answer is **A: I muxaka wa nkuxe**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ku cinca ka mati ka va yo tshwuka swi vangiwa hi ku andza loku tlulaka mpimo ka **Karenia brevis**, ku nga xivumbiwa xa le matini..."" (Changes in water quality are caused by an increase beyond measure of **Karenia brevis**, a type of algae...)
* This directly identifies Karenia brevis as a type of algae (muxaka wa nkuxe).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Xi nga onha misiha eka vanhu (It can cause illness in people):** While the passage *says* Karenia brevis produces neurotoxins that can make people sick, this is a *result* of what it *is*, not what it *is* itself.
* **C: Xi na tisele to hlaya (It has glowing cells):** The passage doesn't mention anything about glowing cells.
* **D: Xi humelela hi ndlela ya ntumbuluko (It reproduces through budding):** The passage mentions ""ntumbuluko"" (reproduction) as a characteristic of *something* associated with Karenia brevis blooms, but not as a defining characteristic of Karenia brevis itself.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi Karenia brevis yi nga swi kotiki ku swi endla?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku humesa neurotoxin**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nkuxu lowu wu endla tineurotoxin leti nga onhaka misiha eka vanhu ni tinhlampfi."" (This bloom produces neurotoxins that can cause illness in humans and fish.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku onha misiha ya tinhlampfi:** While the neurotoxins *cause* illness in fish, the Karenia brevis *produces* them - it doesn't simply cause illness directly.
*   **B: Ku andza hi xihatla eka swiyimo swihi na swihi:** The passage doesn’t state this. It says it grows due to certain conditions, but doesn’t imply it adapts to *any* condition.
*   **C: Ku kavanyeta mati:** The passage doesn't mention anything about discoloring water.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga vangiwangiki hi Xidzedze xa Felicia?","The correct answer is **A: Ku na ka mpfula lokunene** (There is heavy rainfall).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Masalela ya xona ya endle mpfula yo tsutsuxa eka swihlala swo tala..."" (The remnants caused heavy rainfall in many areas...) and ""Ku na ka mpfula, ku fike eka 6.34 wa ti inci eka Oahu..."" (There was rainfall, reaching 6.34 inches in Oahu...). This directly indicates significant rainfall.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku na ka mpfula loku fambisanaka ni ku dzindza ka tilo** (There is rainfall associated with flooding) - The passage doesn't *directly* say flooding occurred, only that there was heavy rain.
* **C: Ku hatima loku hambetaka** (Destructive winds) - The passage mentions Felicia was a Category 4 hurricane, implying potential for wind damage, but doesn't state that destructive winds *actually* happened when the remnants reached the area.
* **D: Ku tala ka mati eswitarateni** (High tides) -  The passage doesn’t mention anything about high tides.



"
Hi xihi xivulwa lexi nga ntiyiso malunghana na Xidzedze xa Felicia?,"The correct answer is **A: Mpfula leyi neke yi pfune Oahu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ku na ka mpfula, ku fike eka 6.34 wa ti inci eka Oahu, ku hlamuseriwe tanihi loku “vuyerisaka”."" (There was rain, reaching 6.34 inches on Oahu, described as ""significant""). This directly confirms significant rainfall on Oahu.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Eku sunguleni a yi tekiwa tanihi matimba ya xihuhuri xa thiropika ivi yi va xidzedze xa Xiyenge 4:** The passage says it *became* a Category 4 hurricane, not that it wasn't initially considered strong.
* **C: Swihlala swo tala swi amukele mpfula:** While the passage mentions flooding in some areas, it doesn't say *all* areas received rain.
* **D: Mpfula yin’wana a yi fambisana ni rihati:** The passage states some rainfall didn't coincide with thunder and lightning, but that's a detail, not the main point about the storm.



"
Hi xihi xivulwa lexi kombisaka kahle vuyelo bya 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix?,"The correct answer is **C: Piquet Jr. u hlongoriwile endzhaku ka sweswo** (Piquet Jr. was disqualified specifically).

The passage states ""Piquet Jr. u hlongoriwile endzhaku ka 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.""  This directly answers the question about what happened at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fernando Alonso u katseke enghozini** (Fernando Alonso crashed) - The passage mentions an incident with Alonso in 2008, not 2009.
* **B: Piquet Jr. u hlurile** (Piquet Jr. failed) - While he was disqualified, ""failed"" is too general. Disqualification is a specific outcome.
* **D: Movha wa vusirheleri wu katseke enghozini** (The safety car crashed) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the safety car crashing.



"
Xana khombo ro chayisa ri endleke rini?,"The correct answer is **A: Endzhakunyana ka loko Aloso wu yimile ku chela petirolo**.

Here's why:

The passage states the incident began *when* Alonso went to pit. Piquet Jr.'s crash happened *while* Alonso was pitting.  The other options don't directly relate to the beginning of the incident as described in the text.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi tekeke nkarhi wutsongo ku tlula lowu valavisisi a va wu ehleketa eku sunguleni?","The correct answer is **D: Hundzuluko wa swivumbiwa (Evolution of species)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the discovery of a new hybrid finch.** This is a direct result of the evolution of species – specifically, the interbreeding of two different finch species (Darwin's finch and cactus finch).
* The passage highlights how this hybrid is *different* from its parent species, which is a key component of evolutionary change.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku tumbuluka ka swivumbiwa (Appearance of species):**  The passage doesn’t focus on the initial appearance of the species, but a *new* variation arising.
* **B: Ku vika hi ta swivumbiwa (Identification of species):** While the researchers *identified* the new finch, the core of the passage isn't about identification itself.
* **C: Ku tswala exikarhi ka swivumbiwa swo hambanahambana (Breeding between different species):** This describes *how* the new finch arose, but doesn't represent the overarching concept the passage demonstrates - which is evolutionary change.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga vikiwangiki hi valavisisi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku leha ka endlelo ra hundzuluko (The pace of evolution)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""valavisisi va vike leswaku muxaka lowuntswha wu humelele eka switukulwana swimbirhi ntsena, hambileswi a ku tshembhiwa leswaku muxaka lowu wu teka nkarhi wo leha…"" (researchers found that a new beak developed in just two generations, despite it not being thought that beaks took so long to evolve).  This directly refers to the *speed* or *pace* of evolution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Laha xivumbiwa lexintshwa xi tumbulukeke kona (Where the new structure originated):** The passage doesn't focus on *where* the beak came from, but *how quickly* it changed.
* **C: Vito ra swivumbiwa leswintshwa (The size of the new structure):** The passage mentions the beak, but doesn't emphasize its *size* specifically.
* **D: Swinyenyana leswi katsekaka eku tswaleni (Mutations occurring during reproduction):** While mutations drive evolution, the passage doesn’t focus on the mutations themselves, but the rapid observable *change* in beak shape.



"
Xana CowParade yi ta endliwa kwihi?,"The correct answer is **B: Eka Doroba ra Bucharest**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Doroba leri ri ta va ro sungula edzongavupeladyambu bya Yuropa ku rhurhela CowParade..."" which translates to ""This city will be the first in Europe to host CowParade..."".  It then says CowParade will be held in Bucharest between June and August.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Emadorobeni yo hlaya ya le Romania** - While it may eventually expand to other cities, the text focuses on Bucharest being *first*.
* **C: Eka Yuropa dzongavuxa hinkwaro** - The text says Bucharest is the first in *Europe*, not all of Europe immediately.
* **D: Emadorobenikulu yo hlaya ya le Yuropa** -  Again, Bucharest is specifically mentioned as the starting point, not all European capitals.



"
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi hlamuselaka kahle CowParade?,"The correct answer is **D: I xiendlakalo lexikulu swinene xo navetisa swilo swa vutshila emisaveni.**

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""ku nga xiendlakalo xa vutshila lexikulu swinene emisaveni, lexi nga ta va kona exikarhi ka June na August lembe leri."" (It is a very large art event on the streets.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While CowParade is held in many cities, the passage doesn't focus on that aspect.
* **B:** The passage mentions the Bucharest City Hall *hosting* it, but doesn't say they *started* it.
* **C:**  It's an art event, but the passage doesn't describe it as being *funded* by the European Union.



"
I yini lexi vangeleke Russia ku yimisa ku tirhisiwa ka ti-II-76?,"The correct answer is **A: Mavuthu ya le ndzeni** (Drones).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Xihahampfhuka lexi a xi ya eIrkutsk naswona a xi hahisiwa hi **mavuthu ya le ndzeni**."" (The aircraft was going to Irkutsk and was shot down by **drones**.)  It then goes on to say Russia is quickly trying to counter this threat, implying the drones are the reason for grounding the Il-76s.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Khombo** (Aircraft) - While the text discusses an aircraft, the *reason* for grounding them isn't simply ""aircraft"" itself.
* **C: Masocha ya Soviet** (Soviet soldiers) - The text mentions the Il-76's history with Soviet soldiers, but this isn't the current reason for the grounding.
* **D: Vulavisisi lebyi ha yaka emahlweni** (Investigation) - The investigation is a *result* of the downing, not the cause of Russia stopping the use of the Il-76.



"
I yini II-76?,"The correct answer is **C: Xihahampfhuka**.

The text explicitly states ""Il-76 a yi ri xiphemunkulu xa masocha ya Russia na Soviet..."" and describes it as a plane that crashed.  ""Xihahampfhuka"" translates to ""aircraft"" or ""plane"".

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Xikwekwetsu** - This doesn't relate to the context.
* **B: Thangi** - This means ""tank,"" which isn't mentioned in the text.
* **D: Xitimela** - This means ""train,"" which isn't mentioned in the text.



"
I mani loyi a hirheke xipanu xo tsala xa The Simpsons?,"The correct answer is **D: Groening**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Hi 1989 u pfunile leswaku ku endliwa The Simpsons with Brooks and **Groening**..."" This indicates Groening was a key figure in the creation of The Simpsons alongside Brooks.

While Brooks is mentioned, the question asks who *created* the show, and Groening is explicitly named as a creator. Simon is a writer/producer, and Ullman was involved with *The Tracy Ullman Show* where The Simpsons shorts first appeared.



"
"Hikuya hi Fluke, i mani loyi a a n’wi rhumelela swibumabumelo leswinene ni xikhuthazo ?","The correct answer is **D: Vanhu va xinuna ni va xisati** (Men and women).

Here's why:

The passage states the strong support and encouragement comes *from both men and women* who don't support female genital mutilation, to take it to the authorities.  

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Madokodela (Doctors)** - While doctors are likely involved in addressing the issue, the passage doesn't specifically state they are the source of the strong support and encouragement.
* **B: Vayimeri va rihanyo ra vavasati (Women's rights activists)** -  They would certainly be involved, but the text explicitly mentions *both* men and women.
* **C: Vavanuna (Men)** - Again, the passage clearly states support comes from *both* genders.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini leswi vanhu van’wana a va nga lavi leswaku vavasati va vulavula ha swona?","The correct answer is **A: Vanhu va xinuna (Men)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that some people are upset that women are speaking out ""about issues that affect women"" and that this is causing concern among men and women who are trying to prevent problems from being taken to court.  This directly points to men being the group uncomfortable with women speaking out.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Swikoxo swa vutshunguri (Court cases):** While the passage mentions court cases, it's a *result* of the women speaking out, not the reason people are upset about it.
* **C: Rihanyo ra vavasati (Women's issues):**  The issues themselves aren't what people are objecting to, but the *speaking out* about them.
* **D: Fluke:** Fluke is a name mentioned in the passage and irrelevant to the question.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi wihi miri wa pulanete lowu rharhanganeke?","The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ku na miri wun’we ntsena wa tipulanete lowu kombisaka ku cinca loku hundzaka Titan, naswona vito ra yona i Misava."" 

This translates to: ""...there is one sea on the planet that resembles the deep sea Titan, and its name is Misava.""

Therefore, the sea is *on* Titan, making Titan the planet being referred to. Misava is the *name* of the sea, not the planet itself.



"
Milambu ni mikova leyi nga ni xihalaki lexi voningelaka yi kumiwile eka miri wihi wa pulanete?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ku na miri wun’we ntsena wa tipulanete lowu kombisaka ku cinca loku hundzaka Titan..."" which translates to ""...there is one river on the planet that resembles the changes of the cold Titan...""

Therefore, the river is located on Titan.



"
Eka leswi kumiweke hi xihi lexi nga vangiwangiki hi hundzuluko wa tinsiva?,"The correct answer is **A: Muvala wa voya bya xiharhi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Van’wasayense va vula leswaku tinsiva ta xiharhi lexi a ti ri ta buraweni wa ribungwana ehenhla kasi ehansi a ti kwalarile kumbe ti ri ta muvala wa xitshopana.""  This directly translates to ""Scientists say that the minerals of this area which are not of the upper layer, are not blue or green.""  Therefore, the color of the minerals is something that isn't affected by the changes in the minerals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku twisisa leswaku tinsiva a ti tirhiseriwanga ku haha** (Understanding that minerals weren't used for building) - The passage *does* mention this, but states it's a consequence of the mineral's properties, not something unaffected by changes.
* **C: Ku twisisa hundzuluko wa tinsiva** (Understanding the changes in minerals) - The entire passage *is about* the changes in minerals, so it can’t be something unaffected by them.
* **D: Ku tiyisisa leswaku tidinasora to tala a ti ri ni tinsiva** (Confirming that many dinosaurs didn't have minerals) - This is a starting point of the discussion, not a detail unaffected by the changes.



"
Xana tinsiva ta dinasora a ti pfumala yini?,"The correct answer is **B: Tirachisi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...valavisisi va vule leswaku tirachisi swi nga endleka a ku ri nhluvukiso lowu teke endzhaku ka nkarhi wa hundzuluko eka tinsiva letin’wana."" This translates to ""...scientists have suggested that cracks might not be a development that occurs over time in other metals.""  Essentially, the passage discusses the possibility of *cracks* (tirachisi) being a unique characteristic of these metals, potentially allowing for control or manipulation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mahakatimba** (spots/marks) - While mentioned as a characteristic, the passage doesn't say they prevent usage.
* **C: Tinsiva letikulu** (large metals) - The passage contrasts these metals with larger ones, noting the larger ones aren't as unique.
* **D: Muvala wo kwalala etlhelo ra le hansi** (color of the upper and lower crust) - This refers to the appearance of the metals and is not related to their usability.



"
Eka swivula leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki ntiyiso malunghana na ZMapp?,"The correct answer is **D: Tidyondzo ti komba leswaku vuyelo bya yona byi le hansi ka leswi a swi languteriwile eku sunguleni.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""kambe tidyondzo ta ximfumo ti kombise leswaku a wu nga vuyerisi swinene hilaha a swi languteriwa hakona eku siveleni rifu.""  This directly translates to ""but rigorous studies have shown that it is not very effective when it is tested in preventing death."" This means its effectiveness is lower than initially hoped.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yi endliwa hi ti-antibody (It is made of antibodies)** - The passage doesn't mention *how* ZMapp is made.
* **B: Yi kota ku tshungula mitluleto leyi nga kona kambe a yi siveli rifu (It can treat existing infections but doesn't prevent death)** - The passage doesn’t state it can *treat* infections, only that it was hoped to prevent death, but failed to do so effectively.
* **C: Yi tirha ku lawula eka ndzingeto wa PALM (It works to control the PALM outbreak)** -  The passage says scientists used it *as a starting point* for research *during* the PALM outbreak, not that it controlled it.



"
Eka swivula leswaku landzelaka hi xihi lexi hlamuselaka kahle ndzingeto wa PALM?,"The correct answer is **B: Xidzidzirisi xo lawula a xi pimanisiwa ni vutshunguri byin’wana, byin’wana bya kona i ZMapp.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Eka ndzingeto wa PALM, ZMapp wu tiaka leswaku van’wasayense va wu tirhise tanihi masungula ivi va wu ringanisa ni vutshunguri lebyin’wana byinharhu.""  This directly translates to ""In the PALM trial, ZMapp is used as a starting point to compare it with other potential treatments.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage mentions ZMapp wasn't as effective as initially hoped, it doesn't say the PALM trial is *more* effective overall. It focuses on *comparison*.
* **C:** The passage says ZMapp is used *as a basis* for the trial, not that it *is* the trial.
* **D:** The passage focuses on comparing treatments, not just understanding the virus itself.



"
Hi kwihi laha valavisisi va ehleketaka leswaku chipi leyintshwa yi ta va ya nkoka swona kona?,"The correct answer is **A: Matiko ya miholo ya le hansi** (Developing countries).

The passage specifically states the innovation could be helpful in ""countries where people lack resources, where the cost of traditional tests is often half that of developed countries."" This directly points to developing countries as the key area of impact.



"
I endlelo rihi leri nga ta tirhisiwa ku endla xitirhisiwa xa vulavisisi?,"The correct answer is **B: Tipurintara ta ntolovelo ta inkjet**.

The passage explicitly states the new diagnostic tool is made ""by using inkjet printers"".  The cost is relevant, but the *method* of creation is what the question asks about.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xivulwa lexi nga riki ntiyiso malunghana na lobate scarps?","The correct answer is **B: Vukona bya swona leswaku n’weti a wu pfumali ku cincacinca loku endlekaka eka n’weti.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mavonelo lama, ya kaneta leswi swi vuriwaka swa ku a ku na ku cinca loku endlekaka eka n’weti.""  This translates to ""These observations support what has been said about the moon not undergoing changes.""  The scarps *challenge* that idea, suggesting changes *have* occurred.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Swiendlakalo leswi swi endleke kumbexana a hi khale swi humelerile** (Events happened a long time ago and were already understood) - The passage implies the *opposite* – these scarps are a new observation challenging existing understanding.
* **C: Swi nga ha tshuka swi vangiwa hi ku tsongahala ka n’weti** (It may be caused by the moon's rotation) - The passage doesn't mention rotation as a possible cause.
* **D: A hi swo tala leswi kumiweke evuandlalweni bya n’weti** (There are many things made on the surface of the moon) - This is a general statement and doesn't address the specific issue of the scarps and change.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi wahi mavonelo malunghana ni xiyimo xa misava lexi kombisaka leswaku ku ni ku cincacinca ka swilo en’wetini?","The correct answer is **C: Ku ni xiyimo xa misava lexitsongo evuandlalweni bya n’weti** (There is evidence of past geological activity on the moon's surface).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ti scarps ti kumiwe eka n’weti hinkwawo naswona ti tikomba ti onge ti hlahlelekile katsongo, sweswo swi kombisa leswaku ku cinca loku a ku endlekanga khale.""  This translates to ""These scarps are found all over the moon and suggest they formed in the distant past, thus showing that changes did occur in the past.""  This directly points to evidence of past geological activity (misava) on the moon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: N’weti lowu vuyelelanaka hakatsongotsongo** (The moon rotates slowly) - While true, this doesn't relate to *evidence of change* on the surface.
* **B: Xiyimo xa misava i khale xi vumbekile** (The ancient state of the surface is established) - The passage actually argues *against* a completely static, unchanging surface.
* **D: Xiyimo xa misava lexi nga kona a hi khale xi humelerile** (The current surface conditions are stable) -  The passage focuses on *past* changes, not current stability.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi swihi leswi nga taka swi nga tali ku kondza ku andlariwa swihehlo?","The correct answer is **B: Ku kandziyisiwa ka swifaniso** (Identification by facial recognition).

Here's why:

* **The passage directly discusses the issue of facial recognition evidence.** It states Adekoya's conviction hinged on facial recognition, but the evidence is questionable because his face was found in many places.
* **The passage highlights the legal challenges with facial recognition in Scotland.**  Scottish courts are hesitant to accept facial recognition as conclusive evidence unlike in other parts of the UK.
* **The professor's quote specifically warns about the dangers of relying on facial recognition.** 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Swibumabumelo swin’wana (Other agreements):** The passage doesn't focus on agreements.
* **C: Mabulo ya vumbhoni bya lava swi voneke hi mahlo (Eyewitness testimony):** While eyewitness testimony is mentioned as being potentially compromised, the central issue is the *facial recognition* evidence.
* **D: Ku kandziyisiwa ka tinhlokomhaka (Identification of characteristics):** This is too broad. The specific problem is facial recognition, not just identifying characteristics in general.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi lexi nga riki xiphiqo eka lava lemaka?","The correct answer is **A: Maxelo yo biha swinene**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""swiyimo swo biha swa maxelo swi kavanyete matshalatshala yo nyika mpfuno wo ponisa."" This translates to ""severe weather conditions are causing widespread power outages.""  The passage then says these conditions are expected to last. The question asks what is *not* a concern for those affected.  While the passage discusses measurements of the ice and dealing with the ice, the *severe weather conditions* themselves are the primary problem – not something to be avoided, but something *causing* the problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mpimo wa ayisi (Ice measurement):** The passage mentions ice measurement *as a way to assess the situation*, so it *is* relevant to those affected.
* **C: Ku tlhandlekelana ka ayisi (Dealing with the ice):** The passage implies dealing with the ice is necessary because of the power outages, making it a concern.
* **D: Ayisi leyi n’okaka (The dirty ice):**  The passage doesn't mention anything about the ice being dirty, so it's not a concern highlighted in the text.



"
"Ku engetela eka ayisi, i yini xin’wana lexi kavanyetaka matshalatshala yo nyika mpfuno wo ponisa?","The correct answer is **B: Xiyimo xa maxelo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku engetela eku fayeni ayisi ayisi, **swiyimo swo biha swa maxelo** swi kavanyete matshalatshala yo nyika mpfuno wo ponisa.""  This directly translates to ""Increasing in the ayisi area, **unfavorable conditions of the fields** affect the yield needed for survival.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku pfumaleka ka switirhisiwa (Dependence on resources):** The passage doesn't mention resource dependence.
* **C: Ku kayivela ka mpfuno (Need for irrigation):**  While the yield is *needed* for survival, the passage doesn't say irrigation is the factor affecting it.
* **D: Lava lemaka (Those affected):** The passage mentions those affected *by* the conditions, but the conditions themselves are what cause the problem.

Hi kwihi ku pfumela loku Roberts a aleke ku ku tiyisisa?,"The correct answer is **B: Nkoka wa vuavanyisi bya le Khotokulu lebyi fambelanaka**.

Here's why:

The passage states Roberts ""kandziyisa nkoka wa vuavanyisi bya le Khotokulu lebyi fambelanaka"" (emphasized the importance of the Court's precedent). He specifically mentions Roe v. Wade in this context, acknowledging its past rulings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku faneleka ko bula hi milandzu (The right to life beginning at conception):** While the passage touches on the concept of when life begins, Roberts doesn't *affirm* believing in it. He acknowledges others feel that way, but his stated position is about precedent.
*   **C: Masungulo ya vutomi (The sanctity of life):** Similar to A, this is a topic mentioned, but not a belief Roberts specifically affirms.
*   **D: Mfanelo yo hlayisa xihundla (The right to choose):** The passage states he believes the core holding of Roe v. Wade should be upheld, but doesn't frame it as a ""right to choose"" directly – it's about the precedent set by the court.



"
Hi yihi mhaka leyi Roberts a ehleketa leswaku a yi nga faneleki ku bula hayona?,"The correct answer is **A: Vuavanyisi bya Khotokulu lebyi fambelanaka**.

Here's why:

The passage states Roberts ""kandziyisile eka marito yakwe leswaku Roe v. Wade a ku ri """"nawu lowu tiyeke wa ta misava """", a kandziyisa nkoka wa **vuavanyisi bya le Khotokulu lebyi fambelanaka**."" This directly translates to him questioning the importance/value of the court's reasoning in that case.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Xiboho xa Roe v. Wade:** He acknowledges the *outcome* of Roe v. Wade (the right to choose) but doesn't say the outcome itself is wrong, just the reasoning behind it.
*   **C: Mfanelo ya xihundla lexi boxiwaka:** He states he *agrees* with the fundamental right to privacy, not that it's something he dislikes.
*   **D: Vuxokoxoko bya milandzu:** This isn’t mentioned in the text.



"
Tiphuphu timbirhi ta rivoni ti voninga kwihi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku kongoma exibakabakeni**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tiphuphu timbirhi ta rivoni ti yimisiwile ti languta etilweni nivusiku."" which translates to ""Two venomous snakes were found lying on the floor at night.""  ""Ku kongoma exibakabakeni"" means ""on the floor.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ku anama ni doroba** - This doesn't relate to where the snakes were found.
*   **C: Ku kongomana ni xihahampfhuka xo sungula** - This refers to the initial attack, not the snakes' location.
*   **D: Exikarhi ka phaka ya xitsundzuxo** - This describes the area where construction is happening, not where the snakes were.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana miako leyintshwa ya swithezi yi akiwa rini endhawini ya kona?","The correct answer is **D: Ku aka ku ya emahlweni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku karhi ku akiwa miako yo leha swinene leyintshwa ya ntlhanu endhawini yoleyo..."" which translates to ""However, five new large gates are being built in that area...""  It doesn't specify a *time* for the building, just that it *is* happening. The phrase ""ku ya emahlweni"" means ""being built/to be completed"" or ""progressing"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ninhlikanhi** - Means ""Unfortunately"" - doesn't answer the question.
*   **B: Hi 8:46 a.m.** - Refers to the time of the bombing, not the gate construction.
*   **C: Nivusiku** - Means ""at night"" - refers to the gates being locked, not constructed.



"
Hi rihi rungula leri ringanyetaka leswaku The Seven Sisters ku vuriwa mabako?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku cincacinca ka maxelo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""ku cincacinca ka maxelo ku suka nivusiku ku ya ninhlikanhi ku kombisa leswaku swi nga endleka ku ri mabako"" (the changing of slopes from night to day suggests they could be dunes). This change in appearance is the key indicator leading scientists to believe ""The Seven Sisters"" are dunes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Vuanamo bya vungheno bya bako:** While the region *is* a dune field, the question asks what specifically led to the *identification* of these as dunes.
*   **C: Vulavisisi bya xiyimo xa misava:** This is too broad. The passage focuses on a specific characteristic – slope changes – not a general study of the planet's surface.
*   **D: Swifaniso swa mabako eMisaveni:** The passage talks about infrared images showing slope changes, not images *of* dunes already identified as such.



"
Xana xiyimo xa mahiselo ya Seven Sisters xi langutisisiwa ku yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Swifaniso swa infrared**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""**Swifaniso swa infrared swi kombisa leswaku ku cincacinca ka maxelo...ku kombisa leswaku swi nga endleka ku ri mabako.**"" (Infrared images show changes in the dunes...suggesting they could be dunes). 

The passage details how infrared imaging revealed patterns consistent with dunes, leading to the conclusion about the ""Seven Sisters"" formation. The other options are *results* of the analysis or descriptions *of* the dunes, but not what was used to *investigate* their nature.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xivulwa lexi nga riki ntiyiso hi muehleketeleriwa?","The correct answer is **B: Ku ehleketiwa leswaku u fuhleke xibuluki** (It is alleged that he used explosives).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Wanuna a a chayela movha wa mavhilwa manharhu a hlome hi swibuluki a ya eka ntshungu."" (The man drove a vehicle loaded with explosives towards the crowd). This directly implies the use of explosives.
* **The passage also states:** ""Ku ehleketiwa leswaku hi yena loyi a buluseke bomu u khomiwele, endzhaku ka ku vaviseka hi ku buluka."" (It is alleged that he is the perpetrator who was subdued, due to being caught fleeing). This supports the idea of his involvement and the use of explosives.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: U tirhise movha enkarhini wa nhlaselo (He used a vehicle in the attack):** While true, the *method* of the attack (explosives) is more specific and the core allegation.
* **C: Rixaka ra yena ri tiviwa hi valawuri (His name is known by police):** The passage explicitly states ""Vito ra yena a ri si tiviwa hi maphorisa"" (His name is not known by police), making this false.
* **D: U vavisekile (He was caught):** This is a result of the incident, not the central allegation about *how* the attack was carried out.



"
Hi rihi rungula ra nhlaselo leri valawuri va ri tiyisiseke?,"The correct answer is **C: Lexi susumeteleke nhlaselo** (The motive for the attack).

Here's why:

The passage states the attacker drove into a crowd and was identified as potentially linked to Uighur separatists. This strongly suggests the attack was motivated by a particular ideology or cause.  The question asks for the *reason* behind the attack - the motive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Swihlawulekisi swa lava a a ri na vona** (Observations of those who saw it) - This is about witness accounts, not the *why*.
* **B: Rixaka ra muehleketeleriwa** (Identity of the victim) - The passage doesn't focus on who was harmed, but *why* the harm happened.
* **D: Vito ni xivongo xa muehleketeleriwa** (Name and age of the victim) - Again, this is about the victim, not the attack's motive.



"
Hi swihi swipanu leswi nga ta tlanga eka ntlangu wa le Ellis Park?,"The correct answer is **C: Afrika Dzonga na Australia**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ntlango wa fayinali wa tiseries wu ta tlangeriwa eEllis Park eJoni vhiki leri taka, loko ti Springboks ti tlanga na Australia."" (The final match of the series will be played at Ellis Park in Johannesburg next week, if the Springboks play against Australia.)

*   **Springboks** represents South Africa.
*   Therefore, the match at Ellis Park will be between South Africa and Australia.



"
Xana ti-Springboks ti ta tlanga kwihi ntlangu wa tona lowu landzelaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Australia**.

The text states: ""Ntlango wa fayinali wa tiseries wu ta tlangeriwa eEllis Park eJoni vhiki leri taka, loko ti Springboks ti tlanga na **Australia**."" (The final match of the series will be played at Ellis Park in Johannesburg next week, if the Springboks play against **Australia**.)



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi xitichi xa swifambo swo ya empfhukeni xi veke ni xiphiqo haxona eka pfhumba leri?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku hlayisa mpfhuka lowunene ku suka eka matimba ya njhini** (To release a heavy object from the engine's power).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Chiao na Sharipov va vike leswaku i mpfhuka lowunene ku suka eka langutelo ro lungisa matimba ya injhini."" (Chiao and Sharipov discovered it was a heavy object released from the engine's control system).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku hlayisa gyroscope:** The gyroscope *failed*, it wasn't released.
* **C: Tirhelo ra jet:** While jets were mentioned in relation to the validator, the passage doesn't say the problem *was* the jet's operation.
* **D: Ku kumisisa mpfhuka lowu tolovelekeke:** The passage says the *desired* trajectory was achieved after the issue was fixed, but doesn't state the problem was misaligning a desired object.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, a ku ri yihi pakani ya pfhumba ra xitichi xa swifambo swo ya empfhukeni?","The correct answer is **A: Ku kuma gyroscope leyi lahlekeke** (To find the missing gyroscope).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the problem was caused by a *lost gyroscope* on the spacecraft. The entire effort described is to address this issue (""xitici a xi cincanga langutelo ra xona, hambileswi va lahlekeriweke hi gyroscope..."").  The other options are things that happened *because* of the gyroscope issue or were related support activities, but weren't the core problem itself.

* **B** refers to a potential source of the problem (engine power), but the passage says the *gyroscope* was lost.
* **C** and **D** describe actions taken or observations made, not the root cause of the spacecraft's malfunction.



"
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki ntiyiso malunghana ni nandzu?,"The correct answer is **C: Nawu wa ti imeyili leti tiviwaka tanihi spam wu tirhisiwile eka nandzu lowu**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the nandzu (virus) was created to *reduce spam emails* by diverting them from unknown senders to users' email boxes. This directly relates to using a technique to handle spam emails.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: U khomiwile eka mfumo wa ntsindza wa AOL:** The passage doesn't say the nandzu was discovered *in* AOL's security system, only that AOL was a large target.
* **B: Ku khomiwe munhu:** The passage focuses on the *nandzu* itself, not a person.
* **D: AOL yi hehliwile:** While AOL was targeted, the passage doesn't state it was compromised or damaged.



"
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi hlamuselaka kahle nandzu lowu?,"The correct answer is **C: Nandzu lowu wu avanyisiwile hi 2003**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""I ro sungula ku tengiwa hi ku tirhisa nawu lowu vekiweke hi 2003..."" (It began to be used using the law enacted in 2003...). This directly indicates the year the lawsuit was filed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: AOL yi hehliwile hi ku hangalasiwa loku nga hleriwangiki** - While AOL *was* sued, the passage doesn't say the lawsuit was frivolous.
* **B: Nandzu lowu a wu katsa vakorhokeri vambirhi lava fambaka emahlweni va inthanete** - The passage focuses on spam and AOL, not other internet pioneers.
* **D: AOL yi sungule ku avanyisiwa ka nandzu lowu** - The passage says AOL was *sued*, not that they initiated the lawsuit.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xipanu lexi Vidal a sunguleke ku tlanga eka xona eka tinguva tinharhu leti hundzeke?","The correct answer is **C: Barça**.

Here's why:

The text states Vidal ""joined Barça at the beginning of last season, coming from Sevilla.""  The question asks where he *started* playing at the beginning of last season. Therefore, the answer is Barça.



"
Xana Vidal u tlange mitlangu yingani eka Barça?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ku sukela loko a rhurhele edorobenikulu ra Catalan, Vidal a a tlange mitlangu ya 49 eka xipano xexo."" which translates to ""Since arriving in the Catalan capital, Vidal has played 49 games for the club.""
"
Hi xihi xipanu lexi a va tlanga na xona eka ntlangu wa kona?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""A a tshama eka hotela ya ntlawa emahlweni ka ntlangu lowu a wu kunguhateriwe Sonto ku lwisana na **Bolonia**."" (He stayed at a luxury hotel before the match against Bolonia).

Therefore, Jarque encountered Bolonia at the match. The other options are locations, not teams or opponents.



"
Hikwalaho ka yini Jarque a a tshame ehoteleni?,"The correct answer is **C: A a ri ni ntlangu hi Sonto**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""A a tshama eka hotela ya ntlawa emahlweni ka ntlangu lowu a wu kunguhateriwe Sonto ku lwisana na Bolonia.""  This translates to ""He stayed at the hotel because he had a match on Sunday against Bologna.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A a ri ni vuleteri (He had training):** While he *was* training, the text directly links his hotel stay to the match.
* **B: A a ri ni nhlangano wa le mahlweni ka nguva (He had a meeting at the time):**  The text doesn't mention any meetings.
* **D: A a tiletela na Bolonia (He was traveling to Bologna):** He was traveling *to play against* Bologna, but the reason for being at the hotel is the match itself.



"
Hikwalaho ka yini geophysics ya Jakarta yi nga humesanga xilemukiso?,"The correct answer is **A: A ku ri hava nxungeto wa tsunami**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hambileswi a ku ri hava nxungeto wa tsunami..."" (Despite there being no tsunami threat...). This directly answers the question of why geophysics in Jakarta didn't issue a warning – because there *wasn't* a tsunami to warn about.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku papalata ku chavisa vaakatiko:** While people *did* evacuate, this is a *result* of the earthquake, not the reason the warning wasn't issued.
* **C: Ku papalata ku kavanyeta mabindzu ya ndhawu:**  This refers to people saving their possessions, also a *result* of the earthquake, not the reason for no warning.
* **D: A yi nga fikeleli mpimo lowu lavekaka wa ku tsekatseka ka misava:** The passage says the earthquake *was* measured at 6.5, implying the geophysics department *did* detect it.  The issue isn't detection, but that the quake didn't warrant a tsunami warning.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana ku tsekatseka ka misava ku vangele yini?","The correct answer is **A: Ku chava eka vaakatiko** (Evacuation of residents).

Here's why:

The text states that despite no tsunami warning being issued, people *started evacuating* (ku chava ivi) and leaving their homes and possessions. This is a direct consequence of the earthquake.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nxungeto wa tsunami** (Tsunami warning) - The text explicitly says there was *no* tsunami warning.
* **C: Ku humesiwa ka xilemukiso** (Issuance of an alert) - While there was an alert about the earthquake, it wasn't a *tsunami* alert.
* **D: Mpimo wa ntikelo wa 6.5** (Magnitude of 6.5) - The earthquake magnitude is the *cause* of the evacuation, not the evacuation itself.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi susumetaka fambiselo ra Dyambu ni tinyeleti tin’wana hinkwato?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku rhendzeleka ni ku vangama**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku vangama ni ku rhendzeleka swi tirhisa swin’we ku kumisisa nhlayo ya Rossby ya nyeleti..."" (Vangama and rhendzeleka are used together to establish the Rossby wave of a star...).  It explicitly identifies *vangama* and *ku rhendzeleka* as the driving forces.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku vangama ni nkhuluko wa pulasima:** While nkhuluko wa pulasima is mentioned, it's a *result* of the process, not a driver of it.
* **B: Nhlayo ya Rossby, ku rhendzeleka, ni timaginete leti ti yi humesaka:** The Rossby wave is *affected* by magnetism, but isn't a driver of the motion itself.
* **D: Ku vangama, nhlayo ya Rossby, ni ku rhendzelaka:**  The Rossby wave is a consequence of vangama and ku rhendzeleka, not a cause.



"
Xana nhlayo ya nyeleti ya Rossby yi kumiwa njhani?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku vangama ni ku rhendzeleka (Vangama ni ku rhendzeleka)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ku vangama ni ku rhendzeleka swi tirhisa swin’we ku kumisisa nhlayo ya Rossby ya nyeleti..."" which translates to ""Vangama and rhendzeleka are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nhlayo ya nkhuluko wa pulasima (Nkhuluko wa pulasima)** - While related (the passage mentions they work *with* the Rossby number), it doesn't *constitute* the number itself.
* **C: Mpimo wa swiendlakalo (Mpimo wa swiendlakalo)** - This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **D: Nhlayo ya timaginete leti ti yi humesaka (Nhlayo ya timaginete leti ti yi humesaka)** - The passage states the Rossby number *affects* how a star interacts with magnetism, not that it *is* a measure of magnetism.



"
I tiphesente tingani ta vanhu lava vutisiweke swivutiso lava seketelaka leswaku Australia yi va rhephabuliki xikan’wekan’we?,"The correct answer is **B: 29 wa tiphesente**.

The text states: ""29 wa tiphesente ta lava vutisiweke va tshembha leswaku Australia yi fanele yi va rhephabuliki hi ku hatlisa..."" which translates to ""29 percent of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic eventually."" This directly answers the question.



"
"Hikuya hi Julie Gillad, xana Australia yi fanele ku va rhephabuliki rini?","The correct answer is **B: Endzhaku ka ku fuma ka Hosi ya Xisati wa Vumbirhi Elizabeth**.

The text states: ""Holobye Nkulu Julia Gillard u vule leswaku eka nhlawulo wa 2010 a a tshembha leswaku Australia yi fanele yi va rhephabuliki eku heteleleni ka ku fuma ka Hosi Ya Xisati Wa Vumbirhi Elizabeth."" This directly translates to ""Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that in the 2010 election she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.""



"
Hi wihi nhlangano lowu lavisisiwaka hi va nawu,"The correct answer is **C: Planned Parenthood**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Stearns yi lavisisiwa hi swa nawu eka loko swibalo swi tirhisiwa ku hakelela ku susa kwhiri hikwalaho ka **Planned Parenthood** eka xiyimo xa yena tanihi mutshama xitulu wa Komiti leyitsongo ya Vukambisisi na Vulavisisi."" 

This directly states that Planned Parenthood was the subject of the investigation.



"
Cliff Stearns i murhangeri wa komiti yihi?,"The correct answer is **D: Komiti Leyitsongo Ya Vukambisisi Na Vulavisisi**.

The text states: ""...Stearns yi lavisisiwa hi swa nawu eka loko swibalo swi tirhisiwa ku hakelela ku susa kwhiri hikwalaho ka Planned Parenthood eka xiyimo xa yena tanihi mutshama xitulu wa **Komiti leyitsongo ya Vukambisisi na Vulavisisi**."" (Stearns was investigated regarding the use of numbers to attempt to discredit Planned Parenthood in his capacity as chairman of the **Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee**.)

While the text mentions the House Energy and Commerce Committee, it specifies Stearns' role is with the *subcommittee* focused on oversight and investigations.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga endlekangiki eka wansati wa Muswiss?","The correct answer is **C: U pfinyiwile hi 5 wa vanhu** (She was kidnapped by 5 people).

Here's why:

The text states: “Hi khome vanhu va ntlhanu lava pfinyeke wansati wa Muswiss naswona hi kume riqhingo ra yena ra le nyongeni na leputhopu” which directly translates to ""We have arrested five people who kidnapped the Swiss woman and we have found her ransom and belongings.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nhundzu yakwe leyi yiviweke yi kumekile** (Her missing belongings have been found) - While belongings *were* found, the primary issue is the kidnapping.
*   **B: U dlayiwile** (She was murdered) - The text does not mention she was murdered.
*   **D: Foni yakwe ni laptop swi yiviwile** (Her phone and laptop were stolen) - Again, belongings were found, but kidnapping is the central event.



"
Hi yihi khampani leyi nyikiweke Sagwadi ra 2007 ra Taiwan Sustainable?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The text explicitly states: ""...ASUS yi nyikiwe sagwadi eka 2007 Taiwan Sustainable Award..."" (ASUS was awarded the 2007 Taiwan Sustainable Award...)."
Xana ASUS Eee PC i yini?,"The correct answer is **B: I laptop**.

The text explicitly states ""Khompyuta ya ASUS Eee, leyi eku sunguleni yi humesiweke emisaveni hinkwayo tanihi leyi xavekaka naswona yi tirhisekaka hi ku olova, yi ve hungunkulu eka 2007 Taipei IT Month."" which translates to ""The ASUS Eee computer, initially launched in all markets as a portable and rechargeable device, was unveiled at the 2007 Taipei IT Month.""  This clearly identifies it as a type of computer, and further context points to it being a *laptop*.



"
I mani loyi a ri ni vutihlamuleri eku lahlekeni ka mapapila ya poso?,"The correct answer is **A: Vatirhi va le posweni (Post office workers)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the post office *discovered* over 600 missing pieces of mail, including New Year's cards. This implies the post office workers were the ones who identified the loss.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ntlawa wa va le Obanazawa (People of Obanazawa):** While they *received* the mail, they didn't discover it was missing.
* **C: Mufana wo karhi (A boy):** The passage doesn't mention a boy being involved in discovering the missing mail.
* **D: Vaviki va mahungu (Foreign visitors):**  They are mentioned as receiving mail, but not as the ones who discovered the issue.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi a humeseke xikombelo xa ku rivaleriwa hi mapapila lama lahlekeke?","The correct answer is **D: Hofisi ya poso ya Obanazawa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tolo, hofisi ya poso yi humese swikombelo swa ku rivaleriwa eka vanhu lava tshamaka eka ndhawu yoleyo na va n’wa mahungu endzhaku ka ku kuma leswaku jaha ri tumbete mapapila wa poso yo tlula 600...""  This directly translates to ""Then, the post office submitted requests for re-issuance to local residents and foreigners after discovering over 600 missing postal items...""

Therefore, the post office (Hofisi ya poso ya Obanazawa) is the one who submitted the requests due to the missing items.



"
Hi rini laha Del Potro a bohekeke ku ongola kahle leri a ri n’wi karhata?,"The correct answer is **C: Eka sete ya vumbirhi** (In the second set).

Here's why:

The text states Del Potro entered the match in his second appearance *and* that he needed to win a tie-break at 6-6 to advance. This implies the struggle and his inability to properly execute his game came in his second set. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Eka sete yo sungula** (In the first set) - The text doesn't mention problems in the first set, only his initial appearance in the tournament.
*   **B: Ku nga si fika tie-break yo sungula** (Before the first tie-break) -  The text specifically mentions needing to win a tie-break, so this is incorrect.
*   **D: Endzhaku ka tie-break ya vunharhu** (At the final tie-break) -  The text indicates a struggle *to get* to a tie-break, not a problem *during* the final tie-break.



"
Vuyelo bya tie-break yo sungula byi ve byihi?,"The correct answer is **A: Murray u lahlekeriwile eka sete you sungula** (Murray lost the first set).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Murray u hluriwile eka ntlangu wo sungula endzhaku ka loko vavanuna lava vambirhi va tlange ku ringana."" This translates to ""Murray won the first game after the two players tied.""  However, the following sentence states that Del Potro won the tie-break ""ka ku tlanga hi ku ringana ka 6-6,"" meaning he won the *set* after a 6-6 tie. Therefore, Murray *lost* the first set.



"
"Hilaha swi boxiweke hakona eka xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi ngopfungopfu a a ri ekusuhi ni muvabyi?","The correct answer is **B: Vana**.

Here's why:

The text states, “Namuntlha, hi kume leswaku vana van’wana lava ringaniweke hi kuya exikolweni ku kumiwe leswaku va tihlanganise na muvabyi.” This directly translates to ""Today, we understand that some children who are transported to school are being brought together with the perpetrator."" 

Therefore, the children are the ones closest to the perpetrator in this situation.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi swihi leswi mulawuri a nga swi tiyisisangiki loko a vulavula ni vaaki va Texas?","The correct answer is **A: Fambiselo ri tirha kahle** (The operation is working well).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on ensuring the operation is functioning as intended.** Perry and the official are discussing how to best utilize the operation (""fambiselo"") to protect people, specifically children going to school. Perry asks to be assured it's working where it needs to. The official responds that they are ensuring it functions effectively.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Swilo swa endliwa ku sirhelela vuhlayiseki bya rixaka** (Things are being done to protect the safety of the area) - While safety *is* the goal, the passage doesn't state that things *are* being done, but rather that they *will ensure* things are done. It's a promise, not a report of action.
* **C: Va lulamerile ku langutana ni ntlhontlho** (They are prepared to meet with the leader) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Mhaka leyi a yi na ntikelo** (The matter has no value) - This is the opposite of what the passage conveys; the operation is considered ""wa nkoka"" (important).



"
Hi wihi nongonoko wa mahungu lowu simekiweke hi khale ka swichudeni swa UW?,"The correct answer is **D: The Onion**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...loko va ha ri swichudeni eyunivhesiti ya UW hi 1988. Ku sukela loko yi sunguriwile, **The Onion** yi hundzuke nhlangano lowukulu lowu encenyetaka mahungu...""

The passage directly links the founding of The Onion to students at UW. The other options are mentioned in the text, but not as being founded by UW students.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga katsiwangiki eka nongonoko wa mahungu wa The Onion?","The correct answer is **B: Filimi**.

Here's why:

The passage mentions the following about The Onion:

*   **Nkandziyiso (Articles):** ""yi ni nkandziyiso lowu printiwaka"" (it has printed articles)

*   **Mepe wa misava (Atlas):** ""yi ni atlas ya misava leyi ya ha ku humesiwaka leyi vuriwaka Our Dumb World"" (it has an atlas called Our Dumb World)

However, there's **no mention of The Onion producing films** in the provided text. Therefore, ""Filimi"" is the one thing not listed as a part of The Onion's work.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi a xi rindziwe hi maphorisa?","The correct answer is **C: Vungheno bya Downing Street**.

The passage states: ""...to counter protests not authorised by the police at Downing Street..."" This clearly indicates the police were dealing with protests related to Downing Street.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Trafalgar Square** - This is where the protest *moved to*, it wasn't what the police initially intervened about.
* **B: Spring Forum** - This is the event the Conservatives were holding, not what the police were responding to.
* **D: Hotela ya Grand Connaught Rooms** - This is where the Spring Forum was held, not the issue the police were addressing.



"
Hi wihi nkarhi lowu maphorisa ma kombeleke lava kombisaka ku vilela ku suka leswaku nkhuluko wa mimovha wu nga tlheli wu kavanyeteka?,"The correct answer is **D: Hi 11:20**.

The text states: ""Hi 11:20, maphorisa ma kombele vakombisakuvilela leswaku va suka epatwini va yima etlhelo, va vula leswaku va boheka ku va pfumelela va kombisa ku vilela kambe a va fanelanga ku siva timovha."" This directly answers the question.

Hi swihi leswi nga ntiyiso hi ndzavisiso lowu endliweke hi Dok. Ehud Ur?,"The correct answer is **B: Makondlo man’wana lawa a ma ri ni vuvabyi bya chukela sweswi a ma ha ri na byona vuvabyi bya chukela**.

Here's why:

The passage states: “Sweswi hi ni makondlo ya tin’hweti ta 4 lawa ma nga riki na vuvabyi bya chukela kambe eku sunguleni a ma ri ni vuvabyi bya chukela.” This directly translates to ""Currently there are 4 cases that do not have diabetes, but initially they did have diabetes.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage says Dr. Ur isn’t sure if diabetes can be *reversed*, and specifically mentions Type 1 diabetes. It doesn't say the research *proves* a cure.
*   **C:** Dr. Ur expresses uncertainty about whether what was found will lead to a cure.
*   **D:** This contradicts the passage, which states some cases *lost* their diabetes.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini leswi vilerisaka Dok. Ur?","The correct answer is **A: Loko leswi kumiweke swi tirha eka vanhu lava nga ni vuvabyi bya chukela bya Type 1**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""...leswi kumiweke a swi va khumbi vanhu lava va nga ni vuvabyi bya chukela bya Type 1.""  This directly translates to ""what was built is unlikely to work for people with Type 1 diabetes.""  This expresses Dok. Ur's concern – the research's potential ineffectiveness for those *without* Type 1 diabetes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage doesn’t mention the possibility of finding a cure.
* **C:** While the passage mentions other researchers, Dok. Ur's concern isn't about their opinions, but the research's likely outcome.
* **D:** The passage doesn't focus on whether the findings will mimic symptoms, but rather on whether they will *work* for a specific population.

Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga hlamuseliki hi ku kongoma ku wa ka Xihahampfhuka xa CG4684?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku lavisisa xihahampfhuka lexi weke swi kavanyetiwile hi maxelo.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Vulavisisi byi kavanyetiwe hi maxelo lama fanaka lama vangeke ku yimisiwa ko yimisa."" This translates to ""The investigation was hampered by factors that could not be overcome."" This directly indicates that the investigation into the crash was *not* successful due to hindering factors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't state the aircraft *couldn't* take off due to technical issues, only that it was grounded.
*   **B:** While the passage mentions the location is inaccessible, this isn't the core reason for the unexplained nature of the crash.
*   **C:** The passage states it was *attempting* to take off, but didn’t specify if it was failing to do so or not.



"
I yini lexi vangeleke Xihahampfhuka xa CG4684 ku tshika xi nga ha phatsami?,"The correct answer is **A: Ndhawu yo phatsama eka yona a yi nga fikeleleki** (The crash site is inaccessible).

Here's why:

* The passage states ""Laha xi weleke kona ku kumekile namuntlha naswona a ku fikeleleki hi ku olova lerova maphorisa mambirhi va siyiwe ekhwatini..."" - This directly translates to ""The place where it crashed has been found but is inaccessible, two police officers were sent by helicopter...""  This means the inaccessibility is the primary reason for the difficulties.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: A ku ri ni swihahampfhuka swin’wana swo hlaya emahlweni ka CG4684** (There were no other planes flying near CG4684) - The passage doesn't mention anything about other aircraft.
* **C: Xihahampfhuka xi byeriwe ku kongoma eKokoda** (The plane was stolen in Kokoda) -  The passage doesn't indicate the plane was stolen. It simply says it crashed near Kokoda.
* **D: Xiyimo xa maxelo a xi nga ri xinene** (The weather conditions were not severe) - The passage states the investigation was hampered by ""maxelo lama fanaka lama vangeke ku yimisiwa ko yimisa"" (favorable weather conditions that could not stop the investigation) which actually means the weather was *good*, not severe.



"
"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga ntiyiso hi Franciszek Kowal?","The correct answer is **A: U faye fasitere**.

Here's why:

The passage states: “Emahetelelweni, fasitere rin'wana ri tshovekile, naswona vanhu va sungule ku huma hi rona,” u vule tano Franciszek Kowal loyi a poneke.  This translates to ""Finally, one window was opened, and people began to escape through it,"" said Franciszek Kowal, the survivor.

This directly indicates that Kowal *opened* a window (faye fasitere) allowing people to escape. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Eku heteleleni a nga vavisekanga:** The passage shows he *was* crucial - he opened the window.
* **C: U tshove xitshamo loko a ringeta ku huma:** The passage doesn't say he moved anything to escape.
* **D: U vavisekile loko a ringeta ku tshova fasitere:** He didn't need help *to* open the window, he *was* the one who opened it.

Hikwalaho ka yini swi tika ku vona ndlela leyi Xidzedze xa Thiropikali Danielle xi nga onhaka hayona?,"The correct answer is **A: Xidzedze xa vhumbiwa leswaku xi nga tshuka xi va bubutsa** (The cyclone is predicted to become a major hurricane).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Va n’wasayense va le National Hurricane Center va vhumba leswaku Danielle yi ta kula yi va xidzedze lexikulu hi Ravunharhu."" This directly translates to ""Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict Danielle will grow into a major hurricane in September.""  Because it's *predicted* to become stronger, it's important to monitor its path.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage doesn't say scientists are unsure of the wind speed. It states the current wind speed.
* **C:** While true for any hurricane, this isn't the *reason* they're watching its path.
* **D:** While the distance from Miami is mentioned, it doesn't explain why its path needs to be monitored.  Distance alone isn't the concern – it's the potential for it to *reach* populated areas.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki ntiyiso hi ta Xidzedze xa Thiropikali Danielle?","The correct answer is **C: Xi nga tshuka xi hundzuka xidzedze lexikulu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Va n’wasayense va le National Hurricane Center va vhumba leswaku Danielle yi ta kula yi va xidzedze lexikulu hi Ravunharhu."" (Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict Danielle will grow into a major hurricane in September.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndlela leyi xi onheke hayona eCaribbean a yi tiviwi** (The path it will take to the Caribbean is unknown) - The passage *does* say it's too early to tell if it will impact the US or Caribbean, implying the path is unknown, but the primary *statement* isn't about the path.
* **B: Xi sungule eLwandle ra Atlantic** (It started in the Atlantic Ocean) -  The passage confirms this (""yi endlekile evuxeni bya Lwandle ra Atlantic""), but it's a basic fact, not a prediction.
* **D: Xi le kusuhi ni ku fika laha ku tshamaka vanhu** (It is close to reaching where people live) - The passage states it's 3,000 miles from Miami, meaning it's *not* currently close to populated areas.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, ku ringanyetiwa leswaku ku fanele ku endleka yini hi vuvabyi byi nga si hundzuka ntungu wa misava hinkwayo?","The correct answer is **A: Byi fanele ku hunguta ku dlaya ka byona**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...tindyondzo tin’wana ti ringanyeta leswaku vuvabyi lebyi byi fanele byi hunguta ku dlaya ka byona byi nga si va ntungu wa misava hinkwayo...""  This directly translates to ""...some studies suggest that this vaccination should be reduced to prevent it from becoming a pandemic.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Matitwelo ya kona ma fanele ma nga karihi** - The passage doesn't discuss whether or not feelings should be ignored.
* **C: Ku fanele ku va ni vanhu vo tala lava tluletiwaka** -  The passage actually suggests limiting spread, not increasing it.
* **D: Vana va fanele va kombisa ku khomiwa hi vuvabyi byebyo** - While vaccination is relevant, the key point is *reducing* its use, not confirming immunity.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana bubutsa a ri ri ekule ku fikela kwihi na Fujian?","The correct answer is **D: 77 wa tikhilomitara**.

The passage states the typhoon was ""77 kilometers from the coast of the large province of Fujian in China.""  Therefore, the typhoon was 77 kilometers away from the Fujian coast."
I mani loyi a xewete George W. Bush loko a fika le Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng na Lee Hsien Loong**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""U xewetiwe hi Xandla xa Holobyenkulu le Singapore ku nga Wong Kan Seng ivi ku buriwa hi timhaka takwe ta bindzu ni ta vutherorisi swin’we na Holobyenkulu wa le Singapore ku nga Lee Hsien Loong."" This directly translates to ""He was received by the Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore, Wong Kan Seng, and accompanied by issues of mutual interest and terrorism with the Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Hsien Loong.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Holobyenkulu** - While Lee Hsien Loong *is* the Prime Minister, Wong Kan Seng also received him.
*   **B: Lava hlengeletaneke** - This is too vague; the passage names specific people.
*   **D: Xandla xa Holobyenkulu** - This is a position, not a person. Wong Kan Seng *holds* that position.



"
Hi rini laha muungameri a vulavuleke kona hi ku ndlandlamuxiwa ka nxaviselano le Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Endzhaku ku lahlekeriwa kakwe eka nhlawulo wa le xikarhi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Endzhaku ka vhiki ra ku lahlekeriwa eka nhlawulo wa le xikarhi, Bush u byele vayingiseri hi ta ku ndlandlamuxiwa ka nxaviselano na Asia."" This directly translates to ""After a week of being away from the central office, Bush returned to reporters with plans to discuss relations with Asia.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Loko a fika le Singapore** - He arrived in Singapore, but the text doesn't say he spoke about Asia *upon arrival*.
*   **B: A ri na Wong Kan Seng** - Meeting Wong Kan Seng was part of his visit, but not related to discussing Asia.
*   **D: Enkarhini wa ku vhakela kakwe le Asia** - This isn't mentioned in the text.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka kwihi ku tiyimisela lokukulu ka hulumendhe?","The correct answer is **A: Ku xava makalichi lama engetelekeke hi March lembe leri** (The discovery of extra graves in March of this year).

Here's why:

The passage states the government's decision was *made* based on the discovery of extra graves. This is the direct trigger for the government's action.  The other options describe *details* about the graves (number, total count, goal of reduction) but don't represent the *basis* for the government's decision.



"
Xana hulumendhe yi tivise yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Va hlela ku xava makalichi lama engetelekeke ya 300**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Xitiviso xa namuntlha xi tlhele xi ndlandlamuxa ku tiyimisela ka hulumendhe loku endliweke hi March lembe leri ka leswaku ku xaviwa makalichi lama engetelekeke."" and ""Makalichi lama engetelekeke ya 300 ma engetele nhlayo ya makalichi ma va 1,300..."" 

This directly translates to the government planning to cull 300 extra crocodiles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While reducing the crocodile population is the *goal*, the passage doesn't say the government is committed to reducing the *pressure* of crocodiles, just their number.
* **C:** The passage states 300 crocodiles will be culled *in addition to* the 1,300 that were already planned to be culled.
* **D:** March is the timeframe for the decision, not the timeframe for the problem to be solved.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi rihi rungula leri tiviwaka?","The correct answer is **A: Mpimo wa nxungeto wu hungutekile** (The investigation measurement has been reduced).

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""...ku hungutiwa ka nxungeto wu yisiwa eka xiyimo xo nyanya..."" which translates to ""...the reduction of the investigation is taken to a final state...""  This directly implies the investigation has been *reduced* or scaled back.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nxungeto a wa ha ri kona** (There is no investigation) - The passage doesn't say the investigation is *gone*, only that it's been reduced.
* **C: Ku languteriwe nhlaselo** (An attack was launched) - The passage mentions an attack *was* attempted, but focuses on the investigation's status *after* that attempt.
* **D: Vutlhari byi tiyisisa leswaku nhlaselo wu ta nyanya** (Evidence confirms the attack will be successful) - The passage states the opposite - that the attack was *not* successful (""nhlaselo wu languteriwe hi xihatla"" - the attack was thwarted).



"
Hi xihi xivulwa lexi nga riki ntiyiso malunghana ni u kombisa ku vilela?,"The correct answer is **A: Khomixini ya muungameri a yi ri n’wangulo wa switereko** (The commission of inquiry is not a solution to the protests).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Khomixini a yi ri nhlamulo ya Martelly eka switereko..."" (The commission is not Martelly's response to the protests...). This directly addresses the question of what isn't a solution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mihlawulo leyi tekeke nkarhi wo leha ku va kona yi vangele ku switereko** (Elections that took time, even if they happened, fueled the protests) - The passage *implies* delayed elections contributed to the protests, but doesn't state it's a falsehood.
* **C: Switereko swi koxe leswaku CEP a tshika ntirho** (Protests showed that the CEP was not working) - The passage supports this, stating the CEP is accused of not functioning properly.
* **D: Switereko a swi pfa swi va ni madzolonga** (Protests were sometimes violent) - The passage specifically mentions some protests involved barricades (""madzolonga"").



"
I mani loyi a ringanyeteke leswaku CEP la hundzeke a tshika ntirho?,"The correct answer is **C: Khomixini ya muungameri** (The commission of inquiry).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Khomixini ya muungameri yi ringanyete ku tsala papila ro tshika ntirho eka CEP..."" which translates to ""The commission of inquiry initiated a document to paralyze the CEP..."".  This clearly indicates the commission is the one taking action to halt the CEP's function.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Martelly:** While Martelly is connected to the situation (the CEP was his fifth one), he's not the one *initiating* the action to stop it.
* **B: Vakombisa ku vilela:** (Protesters) - They are mentioned as those protesting against the government, but not as directly involved in halting the CEP's work.
* **D: Swirho swa CEP swi ringanyetile hi swoxe:** (CEP itself initiated it) - The text does not suggest the CEP stopped itself.

"Hikuya hi xitatimendhe, hi swihi leswi seketeriwiki hi USA Gymnastics endzhaku ka loko Nassar a khome vatlangi ku biha?","The correct answer is **C: Ku cinca loku lavekaka eka nhlangano**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""USA Gymnastics yi seketela...ku amukela ku cinca kwihi ni kwihi loku lavekaka ni loku faneleke"" (USA Gymnastics supports...accepting changes where necessary and appropriate). This directly refers to changing the organization in response to the Nassar abuse scandal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku tekeriwa timfanelo (Taking responsibility)** - While implied, the passage doesn't explicitly state USA Gymnastics is *taking* responsibility, but rather supporting investigations and potential changes.
*   **B: Ku simeka mbango wo nyikiwa matimba (Establishing a safe environment)** - The passage mentions wanting a safe environment, but doesn't focus on this as a direct support statement related to Nassar's actions.
*   **D: Vulavisisi lebyi tiyimeleke (Independent investigation)** - USA Gymnastics supports the investigation, but the primary support mentioned is the willingness to make changes.



"
"Hikuya hi xitatimendhe, hi yihi pakanikulu ya USA Gymnastics na United States Olympic Committee ku ya emahlweni?","The correct answer is **C: Ku hlohlotela vulavisisi lebyi tiyimeleke**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""USA Gymnastics yi seketela vulavisisi lebyi tiyimeleke lebyi nga ha paluxaka ndlela leyi ku tirhisiwa ko biha ka xiyenge lexi hlamuseriwaka hi xivindzi hi lava poneke eka Larry Nassar."" This directly translates to ""USA Gymnastics supports the independent investigation regarding how the abuse by Larry Nassar was handled."" 

While the other options are mentioned in the passage, the *primary* shared priority highlighted is supporting this independent investigation.
"
Xana xikepe a xi ya kwihi loko mhangu yi humelela? ,"The correct answer is **D: Japan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Swi averiwe eka U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet naswona swi kumeka le **Sasebo, Nagasaki e Japani**."" (It was reported by the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet and found in Sasebo, Nagasaki, **Japan**.)

Therefore, the ship was headed to Japan when the incident occurred.



"
Hi swihi leswi nga riki ntiyiso malunghana ni xikepe leswi boxiweke eka xiyenge lexi?,"The correct answer is **A: A xi kongome ePuerto Princesa**.

Here's why:

The passage states the ship was *on its way to* Puerto Princesa, but *didn't* reach it. It was discovered before arriving. The other options are confirmed in the text:

* **B:** Ntsindza wa xona wu le Palawan – The passage says it was on route near Puerto Princesa, which is in Palawan.
* **C:** I xikepe xa magoza ya nhlaselo – The passage identifies it as an Avenger-class assault ship.
* **D:** Xi averiwe Seventh Fleet ya U.S. Navy – The passage confirms it was found by the U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet.



"
I mani loyi a rhumeleke xitatimendhe malunghana ni mavuthu ya US?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

The text clearly states that Donald Trump, the President of the United States, made the announcement regarding the withdrawal of US troops from Syria. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tayyip Erdoğan:** He *received* a phone call from Trump, but didn't make the announcement about US troops.
* **C: Lava lwelaka ISIS:** They are the subject of the situation, not the announcers.
* **D: Matsalana wa vaviki va mahungu:** This refers to the issue being used as justification, not the person making the statement.



"
"Hikuya hi xitatimendhe, hi rihi tiko leri byarheke vutihlamuleri byo rindza vabohiwa lava lwaka?","The correct answer is **D: Turkey**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Turkey a ri ta tlhela ri rindza vabohiwa lava lwelaka ISIS..."" which translates to ""Turkey said it would continue to protect ISIS prisoners..."" This directly indicates Turkey is the country taking responsibility for the prisoners.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Syria:** The text discusses US troops *leaving* Syria, not Syria taking responsibility for prisoners.
*   **B: Yuropa:** The text says European countries were *asked* to take the prisoners back, but they were not the ones originally responsible for guarding them.
*   **C: United States:** The US is withdrawing troops and handing over responsibility, they are not continuing to guard the prisoners.



"
Xana ku ehleketiwa leswaku i yini lexi wiseke xihahampfhuka?,"The correct answer is **B: Ndzilo lowukulu** (a large force).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ku ehleketiwa leswaku yi vangiwe hi **ndzilo lowukulu**."" This translates to ""...it is suspected that it was taken by a **large force**.""  The passage is saying the suspected perpetrator of taking the artifact is a large force.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndhawu leyi nga fambekiki** (inaccessible area) - This describes *where* the artifact was found, not *who* took it.
* **C: Ndhawu ya tintshava** (area of enemies) - This also describes a location.
* **D: Maxelo yo biha** (explosives) - This describes what was used to secure the area, not who took the artifact.



"
Xana xihahampfhuka xi we eka ndhawu ya njhani?,"The correct answer is **A: Leyi nga fambekiki** (The inaccessible one).

Here's why:

The passage states ""Matshalatshala yo lava ndhawu ya mhangu ma siveriwa hi maxelo yo biha **ni ndhawu leyi nga fambekiki**."" (The remains of the mine were covered by sandy areas and **inaccessible terrain**.) This directly links the location of the mine (and therefore the explosion) to the inaccessible terrain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yo biha** (Sandy) - While sandy areas are mentioned, the key description of the location is its inaccessibility.
* **C: Nhlanganelo** (Alliance) - This refers to the coalition forces, not the location.
* **D: Ndhawu ya tintshava** (Enemy territory) -  The passage doesn't specify this; it just states it's in Afghanistan.



"
Xana vatirhelamfumo va langutele yini hikwalaho ka ndhambi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku tlheriseriwa ka sava** (To enlarge the dam).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hambi mpimo wa mati wu nga ta tlakuka ntsena endzhaku ka ndhambi, vatirhelamfumo va tshemba leswaku ma ta va ma ringene ku tlherisela risava ri khuluka ni nambu.""  This translates to: ""Even though the water level might not rise much due to the silt, officials hope to be able to enlarge the dam with mud.""

Therefore, the officials' hope *hikwalaho ka ndhambi* (because of the silt) is to use the silt to **enlarge the dam**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku vumbiwa ka mabuwa** (To build stones) - The passage mentions stones being used *in* the construction, not as the goal *because* of the silt.
* **C: Ku engeteleka ka nkavavangaheti lowukulu** (To increase the large excavator) -  While an excavator is mentioned, increasing it isn’t the officials’ hope as a result of the silt.
* **D: Vutshamo lebyi engetelekeke bya swiharhi** (The increase in animal life) - Animal life is a consequence of the dam, not the reason for wanting to utilize the silt.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi khumbiweke hi ku akiwa ka damu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku akiwa ka sava** (The construction of a dam).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Endzhaku ka loko damu ri akiwile hi 1963..."" (When the dam was built in 1963...).  The entire paragraph discusses the consequences *of* building the dam.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nkavavangaheti lowukulu (A large excavator):** While mentioned, it's a tool *used* in the construction, not the thing constructed.
* **C: Vutshamo bya swiharhi (Animal remains):**  These were found *within* the area that was flooded by the dam, a consequence of building it, not the construction itself.
* **D: Ku andza ka leswi dzikelaka ehansi (Following what is buried below):** This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi a nyikeke rungula eka United States hi ta mihlaselo leyi a yi ehleketeleriwa?","The correct answer is **C: Xihlovo lexi nga paluxiwangiki**.

Here's why:

The passage states the U.S. is concerned about ""the unidentified leadership"" (xihlovo lexi nga paluxiwangiki) that is allegedly directing people to attack using explosives in Kenya and Ethiopia. The U.S. believes this leadership is behind the plans to destabilize the region.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vapfukeri va le Somalia** - The passage mentions people *from* Somalia being involved in the potential attacks, but doesn't directly accuse Somali militants of leading the effort.
*   **B: Vuyimelatiko bya le Ethiopia** - Ethiopia is mentioned as a potential target, not as the source of the leadership.
*   **D: Xihlovo xa le Kenya** - Kenya is also mentioned as a potential target, not as the source of the leadership.



"
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi hlamuselaka kahle rhengu ro hlasela leri ehleketiwaka ra vapfukeri?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku fuhleka tibomo etindhawini ta nkoka ematikweni mambirhi** (The failure of bombs in key areas in two countries).

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states the US embassy warned about foiled plots to use bombs to attack ""key areas"" in *both* Kenya and Ethiopia. 
* Option A only mentions one country.
* Option B is too broad - it doesn't mention ""key areas.""
* Option D is incorrect because the threat was to two countries, not just one.



"
Eka vanhu lava landzelaka hi wihi loyi a nga riki mutivi wa nawu?,"The correct answer is **A: Petros Mantouvalos**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""xirho xa Palamendhe na qgweta, Petros Mantouvalos u tlhakisiwile tanihi leswi swirho a swi katseka eka vugevenga na vukungundzwana.""  This translates to ""A parliamentarian and lawyer, Petros Mantouvalos was accused of involvement in the crime and conspiracy.""  The text *doesn't* identify him as a member of the ""vativi va nawu"" (drug gang).

The other options *are* identified as members of the drug gang:

*   **Sakis Kechagioglou** and **George Nikolakopoulos** are explicitly named as being imprisoned for drug trafficking and conspiracy.
*   **Makis Triantafylopoulos** is mentioned as the author who exposed the gang's activities. Although involved, he's presented as an investigator, not a member.



"
Hi wihi ntlawa wa vanhu lowu nga boxiwiki tanihi xiphemu xa vudyeleri eka ntlawa wa vativi va nawu va Magiriki?,"The correct answer is **D: Vagqweta**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...vativi va nawu, **vadyeleri ni vagqweta** va swi endleke hi nkarhi wa malembe lama hundzeke."" This directly identifies vagqweta (lawyers) as part of the group involved in the case alongside the defendants and researchers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vadyeleri:** While mentioned in the passage, they are listed *alongside* vagqweta, not as the sole group being discussed in relation to the defendants.
*   **B: Vaavanyisi:** The passage mentions researchers (""Vaavanyisi"") but not in the context of being part of the defense team.
*   **C: Vatsari va mahungu:** This option isn't mentioned in the passage.

Xana India yi lahlekeriwe hi tiwiketi tingani?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The passage states: ""...endzhaku ka ku humesiwa ka mukaputeni wa le India loyi endleke tirhani ta 36 ntsena ivi ku humesiwa **tiwiketi ta 7** ku heta ntlangu.""  This directly translates to ""...finally the Indian captain completed 36 runs before being dismissed for **7 wickets** to end the innings.""

Therefore, India lost by 7 wickets."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, a ku ri xihi xikoro xa le henhla ka ntlangu?","The correct answer is **A: 70 wa tirhani**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Robin Uthappa u fikelele xikoro xa le henhla xa ntlangu, **tirhani ta 70** hi tibolo ta 41..."" (Robin Uthappa scored a high score, **70 runs** with 41 balls...)

Therefore, the high score was 70 runs."
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki xivangelo xa ku pfilunganyeka ka Adam Cuerden?,"The correct answer is **A: Pholisi leyintshwa ya xivandla xexo malunghana ni hungu ra swa masangu** (New policy of the area regarding image rights).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ku pfilunganyeka ka rixaka ku vangela matshalatshala ya sweswi yo andlala pholisi malunghana ni lava tameleke ta masangu eka xivandla lexi rhurhelaka timiliyoni ta mahungu lama nga ni layisense ya mani na mani.""  This directly translates to ""The controversy arose due to changes to the policy regarding image rights in the area that hosts millions of images with any license.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku susiwa ka swifaniso swa vutshila hi Wales** (Removal of vutshila images by Wales) - While Wales is mentioned, the issue isn't *just* about removing images, but about the underlying policy.
* **C: Ku pfumala ku yingisiwa hi Wales** (Approval of translation by Wales) - Translation is mentioned as a *result* of the controversy, not the cause.
* **D: Mavunwa malunghana ni ku susiwa ka swifaniso swa vutshila** (Disputes regarding the removal of vutshila images) - Similar to B, this focuses on a consequence, not the root cause.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi susiweke exivandleni xexo?","The correct answer is **B: Leswi tameriweke timhaka ta masangu** (Issues related to copyright).

Here's why:

The passage states the controversy revolves around ""matshalatshala ya sweswi yo andlala pholisi malunghana ni lava tameleke ta masangu"" which translates to ""issues currently debating policy regarding copyright holders.""  Adam Cuerden's actions sparked this debate specifically concerning copyright on the platform.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Swifaniso swa vutshila (Images of life):** While images *could* be involved in a copyright issue, the passage doesn't specifically mention images.
* **C: Ku andlariwa ka pholisi (Policy development):** The passage states a policy is being *debated*, not necessarily developed.  The controversy *leads to* potential policy changes.
* **D: Vaviki va mahungu lava tiyimeleke (Represented copyright holders):** The passage mentions copyright holders but doesn't focus on their representation; it's about the policy surrounding them.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi Amir Khan a nga xi seketeliki?","The correct answer is **A: Ku katsa vavasati lava lwaka eka Tiolimpiki**.

Here's why:

The passage states Amir Khan believes ""women should not be allowed to fight."" This directly indicates he *does not* support women competing in boxing at the Olympics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Vaphikizani va Britain:** The passage says he *will* support British fighters.
* **C: Mavonelo ya vavasati:** While he has an opinion about women fighting, the passage doesn't say he doesn't respect their opinions.
* **D: Ku va London yi rhurhela Tiolimpiki:** The passage mentions London hosting the Olympics but doesn't suggest he's against it.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi Amir Khan a nga ta xi seketela swi nga ri na mhaka leswaku mavonelo yakwe hi wahi?","The correct answer is **C: Tiolimpiki ta 2012**.

Here's why:

The passage states Amir Khan's views led him to *consider* supporting the British competitors at the 2012 Olympics. He felt women shouldn't be allowed to fight, and this belief influenced his potential support for Team Britain in their home games.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vaxisati lava lwaka:** He *opposed* women fighting, he wouldn't support them.
*   **B: Vaphikizani kulobye va Tiolimpiki ta 2004:** The passage focuses on his potential support in 2012, not his past competition.
*   **D: Vaamukeri van’wana va timedali ta silivhere:** His medal is mentioned as background, not as the focus of his support.



"
Xana Peter Lenz u fe rini?,"The correct answer is **A: Hi nkarhi wa xiyenge xo tiolola**.

The text states: ""Loko a ha ri eka xiyenge xo tiolola, Lenz u wile eka xithuthuthu xa yena..."" (While in the pit lane, Lenz fell off his motorcycle...). This directly indicates he died during the pit stop/practice session.



"
Xana Xavier Zayat i mani?,"The correct answer is **A: I mutirhi wa vutshunguri wa le mphikizanweni** (He is a rescue worker at the competition).

The text states: ""...u tlumbiwa hi mutlangi kulobye Xavier Zayat."" which translates to ""...was hit by a rescuer named Xavier Zayat."" This clearly identifies Zayat as a rescue worker.



"
Hi le ka xiyimo xihi laha muhahisi loyi a chuheke a nga tshukaka a vuyeriwa hi ku twisisa matirhelo ya xihahampfhuka?,"The correct answer is **B: Loko ku nyenya ka vona ku haha swi vangiwa hi ku chava leswi a nga swi tiviki.**

Here's why:

The passage discusses how understanding *xihahampfhuka* (dreams/visions) can help reduce anxiety or fear related to the unknown or frightening experiences. Option B directly reflects this – if someone is disturbed by a dream they don't understand, gaining insight into it through interpretation can alleviate that disturbance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Loko mukhandziyi a khomiwa hi tingana hi ku chava kakwe:** This relates to being overwhelmed by crowds and self-consciousness, not dream interpretation.
* **C: Loko mukhandziyi a chava mixaka hinkwayo ya vutleketli:**  This focuses on confessing all sins, which isn't the primary point of the passage.
* **D: Loko ku vilela ka vona ku vangiwa hi swilo leswi chavisaka leswi nga yelaniki ni ku haha:** This refers to crying being caused by disturbing things and relating to dreams, but doesn't focus on the *understanding* aspect that the passage emphasizes as beneficial.

"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi mufambi loyi a rhandzaka ku pimanisa mitsengo a fanelanga a hetelela hi xona ku xi endla?","The correct answer is **C: Ku pimanisa mitsengo exikarhi ka tikhampani to hlaya ta swihahampfhuka** (Comparing prices between different companies).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the importance of ""ku pimanisa mintsengo ya tikhamphani"" (comparing company prices) and mentions that similar products can have different prices when you compare across companies. It also suggests checking a company's website *after* initial research and comparison.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku secha mitsengo yo hambanahambana ya tikhampani ta swihahampfhuka** (Searching for varying prices of companies) - This is part of the process, but doesn't represent the *goal* or what the traveler should *finish with*.
* **B: Ku buka xihahampfhuka eka khamphani ya xona** (Opening a product at a certain company) - The passage says this is what you do *after* initial price comparison.
* **D: Ku kamba webusayiti ya xihahampfhuka** (Visiting a product website) - Similar to B, this is a step in the process, not the final outcome the traveler is seeking.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini leswi vakhandziyi va rhangaka va swi endla leswaku kuma mitsengo leyinene ya swihahampfhuka?","The correct answer is **B: Ku pimanisa mitsengo exikarhi ka tiwebusayiti leti longoloxaka mitsengo** (Comparing prices across price comparison websites).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sometimes a similar product may have different prices when you combine everything and it pays to compare the price that comes when you research and search on the product company's website without opening it.""  This directly implies that comparing prices from *different* sources (like price comparison websites) is valuable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku kamba webusayiti ya xihahampfhuka** (Visiting the product website) - The passage suggests *searching* the website *without opening* it, implying checking listed prices, not just visiting the site.  It also highlights the benefit of comparing *to* this price.
* **C: Ku buka eka khampani ya xihahampfhuka hi ku kongoma** (Opening the product company by phone) - The passage doesn't mention phone calls.
* **D: Ku buka eka muyimeri wa xihahampfhuka hi ku kongoma** (Opening the product representative by phone) -  The passage doesn't mention contacting representatives.



"
Xana muheleketi u boheka rini ku fambisana ni ndzhwalo?,"The correct answer is **A: Loko swilo swi rhumeriwa hi xihahampfhuka** (When things are shipped by courier).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ndlela yin’we ntsena yo hatlisa a ku ri ku rhumela tanihi ndwalo lowu kamberiweke. Swipimelo swa swihaha mpfuka a swi nge va pfumeleli leswaku va rhumela ndwalo ku nga ri na munhu...""  This translates to: ""One quick way is to ship as a pre-packaged parcel. Courier companies generally do not allow sending parcels without a person...""  This directly links needing a signature/someone to receive the parcel to using a courier service (xihahampfhuka).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Loko khampani yi tirhisa swihahampfhuka swa yona** (When a company uses its own couriers) - The passage doesn't specify needing a signature *because* a company uses its own couriers.
* **C: Loko swilo swi rhumeriwa tanihi ndzhwalo lowu kamberiwaka** (When things are shipped as a pre-packaged parcel) - While mentioned, this is *because* of the courier, not the cause of needing someone present.
* **D: Loko ndzhwalo wu tameriwa hi khampani leyikulu** (When the parcel is sent by a large company) - The passage states large companies *may* have more options, but doesn't link them directly to needing a signature.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...u fanele u lemuka leswaku malunghelo lama nyikiwaka ya hambana eka minkarhi yo tala naswona switici swo karhi swi nga hanana hi ndlela yo hambana ehansi ka **swihaha mpfuka leswi nga eka ntlawa lowu fanaka**.""  

This directly refers to considering how the benefits (or conditions) *vary* depending on the specific plan (xihahampfhuka) you are using, even within the same provider (ntlawa). You need to be aware of how the plan you *specifically* use affects your benefits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Xihahampfhuka lexi nyikaka tipoyinti to tala** - The passage doesn't focus on points.
* **B: Xihahampfhuka lexi tirhisiwaka ngopfu** - Popularity isn't the important factor.
* **D: Xihahampfhuka lexi nga engetelaka malunghana man’wana** - While additional benefits exist, the passage focuses on *understanding the specific terms* of the plan you have.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi a nga tshukaka a nyika tipoyinti to tala to famba hi xihahampfhuka?","The correct answer is **C: Xihahampfhuka lexi u fambaka ha xona ngopfu eka ntlawa lowu hambaneke** (A different vehicle on a different network).

Here's why:

The passage states that even though it might *seem* like a good deal to pay a consistent fee for a vehicle, you need to remember that terms can vary greatly depending on the network *and* the vehicle.  The passage implies that you'll get more points/benefits by using a vehicle on a *different* network frequently.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Xihahampfhuka xin’wana xa ntlawa lowu hambaneke** (A different vehicle on a different network) - This is partially correct, but the passage emphasizes *frequent* use.
* **B: Xihahampfhuka lexi u fambaka ha xona ngopfu eka ntlawa lowu fanaka** (A vehicle you use frequently on the same network) - The passage explicitly says sticking to the same network isn't necessarily the best strategy.
* **D: Xihahampfhuka xin’wana eka ntlawa lowu fanaka** (A different vehicle on the same network) -  This doesn't highlight the benefit of varying networks, which is the key takeaway.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka switwi leswi landzelaka hi swihi leswi nga tsanisiwaka hi ku byalwa ku tlula mpimo?","The correct answer is **A: Ku twa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that drinking alcohol *to excess* (byalwa nwaka byalwa va byi n'wa hi mpimo lowu ringaneke) can lead to serious consequences like blindness (""matihlo"") and death (""rifu"").  The passage is warning against *overconsumption* – drinking *too much* alcohol.  ""Ku twa"" means ""to drink,"" and in the context of the passage, it refers to the act of drinking alcohol to a dangerous extent.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku vona (to see)** - The passage mentions blindness *as a result* of overconsumption, but isn't about the act of seeing itself.
* **C: Nantswo (this one)** - This is a demonstrative pronoun and doesn't fit the context.
* **D: Nun’hwelo (feeling)** - While overconsumption *can* cause feelings of illness, the passage focuses on the physical dangers.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Byalwa nwaka byalwa va byi n'wa hi mpimo lowu ringaneke."" (Alcohol should be drunk in moderation.) and goes on to explain the dangers of excessive consumption.
* The passage warns about the dangers of *unregulated* alcohol (like that containing methanol) and excessive drinking, but the core message about preventing harm is about *how much* you drink.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku nwa byalwa lebyi nga na methanol** (Drinking alcohol containing methanol) - The passage warns *against* this, it's not a way to reduce harm.
* **B: Ku nwa swipiriti leswi nga riki enawini** (Drinking unregulated spirits) -  Similar to A, this is a danger highlighted in the passage, not a preventative measure.
* **D: Ku nwa ni vanhu vo hambana** (Drinking with different people) - This is irrelevant to the dangers discussed in the passage.

Xana ntsengo wa miako yi le ka xiyimo xihi eka leyi tlakukeke le Amsterdam?,"The correct answer is **D: Tindhawu leti nga ni ntikelo wa matimu** (Places with unique cultures).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Xifundza hinkwaxo xi endliwe ndhawu ya UNESCO World Heritage Site **hikwalaho ka ndhavuko ya xona lowu hambaneke na matimu**..."" (The entire canal ring was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site **because of the unique culture of that area**...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Xifundza xa Canal (Canal Ring)** - While the question *is* about the canal ring, this isn't the *reason* for the uniqueness mentioned in the passage.
* **B: Eka ndhawu yihi ni yihi endliweke UNESCO World Heritage Site (Where was it made a UNESCO World Heritage Site)** - This asks *where*, not *why* it was designated.
* **C: Tindhawu leti susiweke eka Binnenstad (Areas built in Binnenstad)** - This simply states where it's located, not what makes it special.



"
Hikwalaho ka yini Xifundza xa Canal xi endliwe UNESCO World Heritage Site?,"The correct answer is **A: Ntikelo wa xona wa matimu ni mfuwo** (The unique architecture and town planning).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Xifundza hinkwaxo xi endliwe ndhawu ya UNESCO World Heritage Site **hikwalaho ka ndhavuko ya xona lowu hambaneke na matimu, na miako ya xona ya vitana swinene** eka miako ya tiko hinkwaro."" 

This translates to: ""The entire canal ring was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site **because of the unique architecture and town planning, and the buildings are very different** from buildings in other countries.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Swihlawulekisi swa xona** (The beauty of the area) - While the area *is* beautiful, the passage specifically mentions architecture and planning as the reason for the designation.
* **C: Ndhawu ya xona ku rhendzela Binnenstad** (The location of the area next to Binnenstad) - Location is a factor, but not the primary reason for UNESCO status.
* **D: Ntikelo wa xona lowukulu** (The size of the area) - Size isn't the determining factor for UNESCO status; it's the cultural and historical significance.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku vhakela ndhawu leyi ku nga hlanganisiwa na riendzo ra xikepe ra kuya eka tiva."" (Visiting the area can be combined with a boat trip to the lake.) This directly links visiting Phnom Krom with the boat trip, making it a key aspect of the experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku vonakala ka yona loko u ri le Tonle Sap:** While you can see Phnom Krom *from* Tonle Sap, it's not what *makes* visiting it worthwhile.
*   **B: Ku famba ku suka le Angkor Pass:** The passage mentions needing a passport for Tonle Sap, not the Angkor Pass for Phnom Krom itself.
*   **C: Ku vona Siem Reap:** Phnom Krom is near Siem Reap, but just *being* near Siem Reap doesn't make visiting Phnom Krom special.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi lavekaka eka vaendzi ku nghena ePhnom Krom?","The correct answer is **C: Ku fika eAngkor Pass**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Loko u hundza hile Angkor swa laveka leswaku u nghena eka thempele hikwalaho u fanele u ta na phaspoti ya wena loko u ya eTonle Sap."" This translates to: ""When visiting Angkor it is required that you enter the temple otherwise you must have your passport if you go to Tonle Sap."" This implies needing an Angkor Pass to enter Phnom Krom (which is within the Angkor area).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku khandziya ku hundza etempeleni ya Yasovarman** - The text mentions appreciating the temple, not paying to enter it specifically.
*   **B: Ku rhendzeleka Siem Reap** - Being near Siem Reap is a location fact, not a requirement for entry.
*   **D: Ku fambafamba hi xikepe eTonle Sap** -  A boat trip is *optional* and mentioned as something you can *combine* with a visit, not a requirement to enter Phnom Krom itself.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ma endleriwa ntsena eka Nhlonhle, Swihlala na Lwandle ra Ross."" and ""...ma nga endliwa ntsena hi ximumu hi Hukuri-Nyenyana..."" This means research is done seasonally, specifically during the Antarctic summer (N’wendzamhala - November & Sunguri - December).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mali yo tala swinene yo famba:** The passage doesn't mention cost as a factor.
*   **B: Ku navela ntsena ku valanga Lwandle ra Ross:** While accessing the Ross Sea is mentioned, it doesn't explain *why* researchers go to Antarctica.
*   **D: Ku hunguta ku fambafamba:** The passage describes the harsh conditions and remoteness, not a desire to reduce travel.



"
Muvalangi loyi a tsakelaka ku khandziya tintshava a nga endzela ndhawu yihi ya Antartica?,"The correct answer is **B: Ndhawu ya le Ndzeni ka Tiko**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mapfhumba yo hlawuleka ya le moyeni ya minkarhi yo karhi ya endliwa endzeni ka tiko, ka vakhandziyi va tintshava kumbe ku fikelela Pole..."" This directly translates to ""Significant air journeys are made towards the interior of the continent, by explorers or to reach the Pole...""  Therefore, someone wanting to explore/discover (khandziya) would go towards the interior of the continent (""Ndhawu ya le Ndzeni ka Tiko"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lwandle ra Ross:** The text mentions it as a location where research is done, not where explorers head.
*   **C: Nhlonhle:** Similar to Lwandle ra Ross, it's a research location.
*   **D: Swihlala:**  Also a research location mentioned in the text.



"
Xana ndhawu ya languta swa le xibakabakeni ya xikhale yi nga ha tshuka yi va kwihi?,"The correct answer is **A: Endhawini leyi fikelekaka hi ku olova** (In a place accessible by road).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...tanihi leswi eka nkarhi wa swona a ku nga ri na swiphiqo swa ku layita loku ku endliwaka hi vanhu namutla, ti tolovele kuva eka madoroba kumbe tikhempasi, leti kumekaka hi ku olova ku nga leti akiweke eka manguva lama.""  This translates to: ""...at that time there were no problems with people using it, it is preferable to be in towns or on campuses, which are accessible by road and were not built in ancient times.""

Therefore, the passage directly links the desirable location of these old sites to accessibility by road.



"
Xana thelesikopu ya vulavisisi ya manguva lawa yi nga tshuka yi kumeka kwihi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ekhempasini ya yunivhesiti** (At a university campus).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ti tolovele kuva eka madoroba kumbe **tikhempasi**, leti kumekaka hi ku olova ku nga leti akiweke eka manguva lama.""  This directly translates to ""...we prefer them to be in cities or **campuses**, which are found through funding that isn't built in a short time.""  It also mentions needing good atmospheric conditions, which universities with observatories often prioritize.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Emuziyamu (In a museum):** While museums *might* have smaller telescopes for public viewing, they are rarely the site of large, research-grade telescopes.
*   **C: Exivandleni xa dyondzo (At an educational center):**  Too broad. While related, a university campus is a more specific and likely location.
*   **D: Eka muako lowukulu (At a large mine):** This doesn't fit the context of atmospheric conditions or research.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi yihi ndhawu leyi nga vaka yinene ku va na siku ro rhula eribuweni?","The correct answer is **A: St Heliers**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mabuwu ya Tamaki Drive ma kumeka eWaitemata Harbour, etindlwini leto durha ta **Mission Bay na St Heliers** le Central Auckland. Mikarhi yin’wana ti va-mabuwu lama taleriwaka hi mindyangu laha ku nga ni nxaxamelo lowunene wa switolo leswi xaxameleke ni ribuwu. Ku hlambela swi hlayisekile.""

This means both Mission Bay and St Heliers have beaches on Tamaki Drive in Waitemata Harbour *where swimming is possible with less risk*.  The passage specifically highlights that some beaches have calmer conditions (""nga ni nxaxamelo lowunene wa switolo leswi xaxameleke ni ribuwu"") which suggests a more peaceful beach experience. While both fit the description, **St Heliers** is directly mentioned alongside the description of calmer waters, making it the best answer.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mission Bay:** While mentioned, it doesn't have the specific qualifier of calmer swimming conditions.
*   **C: North Harbor District:** This is a larger area, and the passage describes beaches *within* that area, but doesn't say it's generally peaceful.
*   **D: Waitemata Harbor:** This is a body of water, not a specific beach location."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi kwihi laha swiyimo swo hlambela swi nga sirhelelekaka kona?","The correct answer is **A: Devonport**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mabuwu ya le North Shore (exifundzheni xa North Harbour) ma kumeka eLwandle ra Pacific naswona ma andlaleke ku suka eLong Bay en’walungwini ku ya eDevonport edzongeni. Mabuwu ya kona ma taleriwe hi sava laha ku hlambela kona swi hlayisekeke...""  This directly translates to ""Beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour area) are found in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the west to Devonport in the east. The beaches there are sheltered where swimming is safe...""

Therefore, Devonport is described as having sheltered beaches where swimming is safe, implying other areas might *not* be as safe.



"
"Loko u endzela ndhawu leyi hlamuseriwaka eka xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga langutiwaka xi nga faneleki?","The correct answer is **A: Ku languteka hi ndlela ya ximfumo (To suffer in a dignified manner)**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt explicitly asks for respect, sensitivity, and decorum when depicting a sensitive location.** It specifically warns against sensationalism, exploitation, and comparisons to tragedies like the Holocaust or Nazism.  ""Ku languteka hi ndlela ya ximfumo"" (suffering with dignity) aligns perfectly with this request. It acknowledges the potential for pain and hardship within the location, but emphasizes handling it with the utmost respect.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku tsalatsala exivandleni lexi (To scribble on this wall):** This is disrespectful and defaces the location. The prompt asks for respect, not vandalism.
* **C: Ku endla mafenya (To make jokes):**  This is completely inappropriate given the sensitive nature of the requested depiction. The prompt emphasizes seriousness and respect.
* **D: Ku hala muako (To steal):** This is illegal and unethical, and has no place in a respectful depiction of a location.



Therefore, **A** is the only response that aligns with the request for sensitivity and respect outlined in the prompt."
Eka leswi landzelaka i yini leswi hlamuselaka tindzimi to pfuneta?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti lo endliwa hi munhu** (They are created by people).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Tindzimi to pfuneta...leswaku vanhu lava swi va tikelaka ku twisisana hi ririmi va kota ku twisisana."" (Functional languages...so that people who use them to communicate can understand each other.) This directly implies they are *made* for human communication, and therefore created by people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: A hi ta ntumbuluko** (They will develop) - While languages *do* develop, the passage focuses on their initial purpose and creation, not future evolution.
* **C: Ti lo tumbuluxiwa** (They are discovered) - Languages aren't ""discovered"" like natural phenomena; they are constructed and learned.
* **D: Ta cincacinca** (They change) -  Like option B, this is true, but doesn't capture the *defining* characteristic of functional languages as described in the passage.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly describes ""tindzimi to pfuneta"" (constructed languages) as being *made* so that people who speak different languages can understand each other.** Option A captures this essence - languages that are changeable and created for communication between those with different native tongues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I tindzimi ta ntumbuluko ni leti tumbuluxiweke (Natural and developed languages):** The passage *contrasts* constructed languages with natural languages. This is the opposite of what the question asks for.
* **C: I tindzimi leti endleriweke ku antswisa swiyimo leswi tikaka swa mbulavurisano (Languages created to simplify communication situations):** While constructed languages *can* simplify communication, the passage focuses on bridging the gap between *different* languages, not just simplifying a situation.
* **D: I tindzimi leti tirhaka swinene eka lava vulavulaka tindzimi tin’wana (Languages used extensively by polyglots):** This doesn't define what constructed languages *are*; it describes *who* might use them.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi mukhandziyi a faneleke ku xi kamba loko xikepe xakwe hi xixika?","The correct answer is **A: Ndhawu ya xikepe** (Location of the ship).

**Here's why:**

The passage states the person needs to inform authorities where their ship is located (""kumisisa leswaku kamara ra wena exikepeni ri le kwihi""). The entire scenario revolves around needing to know the ship's whereabouts due to icy conditions and potential difficulties in assistance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Swilaveko swa visa (Visa requirements):** While visas are mentioned as *not* being checked, the passage isn't about needing a visa.
* **C: Swinawana (Relationships/Connections):** This is completely irrelevant to the passage.
* **D: Nkarhi wo wu tshama edorobeni (Time spent in the city):** The time spent in Saint Petersburg is a detail, but not what the captain *needs to report*.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xikepe xa mukhandziyi hi ximumu, i yini lexi va nga kotaka ku xi papalata?","The correct answer is **C: Swilaveko swa visa**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Visa a yi laviwi eka vakhandziyi va swikepe (kumisisa milawu ya kona)"" - meaning visas are not required for ship crews (understanding local laws). The question asks what the crew might need to *avoid* needing to dock/stay longer.  Visa issues would definitely cause delays.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nkarhi wo wu heta edorobeni:** The time spent in the city is irrelevant to *needing* to dock.
* **B: Ku famba eayisini:** Ice conditions are mentioned as making travel difficult, but not as something they need to avoid needing a visa for.
* **D: Saint Petersburg:**  The ship is *at* Saint Petersburg; it’s not a problem they need to avoid.

Hikwalaho ka yini Xicatalan xi hambeta xi tirhiseriwa swifaniso ni switiviso eBarcelona?,"The correct answer is **B: A ku ri ririmi ro sungula ra ximfumo edorobeni** (It is the official language of the government in the city).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ti sayini to tala ti kombisiwe hi Xicatalan hikuva swi simekiwe hi nawu leswaku hi rona ririmi ro sungula ra le nawini"" (most signs are shown in Catalan because it is established by law as the official language of the government).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Xi twisisiwa swinene ku tlula Xipaniya** (It is better understood than Spanish) - The passage says everyone understands Spanish, but many *struggle* to understand Catalan.
* **C: I ririmi leri tsakeriwaka le Barcelona** (It is the most popular language in Barcelona) - The passage doesn't state popularity, only official status.
* **D: Metro ni swivandla swin’wana swo tirhisiwa hi rixaka swi endzeriwa ngopfu hi vaakatiko lava vulaka Xicatalan** (The Metro and other public services are more used by Catalan speakers) - The passage mentions Metro uses Catalan for announcements, but doesn’t imply service use is limited to Catalan speakers.  It even points out other languages are used for information.



"
Eka tindzimi leti landzelaka hi rihi leri tirhisiwaka hi Metro ya le Barcelona eka switiviso swa ntolovelo?,"The correct answer is **B: Catalan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Switiviso eka ti Metro swi endliwa hi Catalan..."" which translates to ""Announcements on the Metro are made in Catalan...""

Therefore, Catalan is the language used for announcements on the Barcelona Metro."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka switirhisiwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga taka xi nga tsakeriwi ngopfu hi ndhawu ya byetlelo ni xifihlulo ya xiyimo xa le henhla?","The correct answer is **A: Swilo swa menyu yo hlawuleka** (Affordable menu items).

Here's why:

The passage specifically highlights that B&Bs in mountainous areas compete on two main things: **accommodation and affordable food**. It emphasizes finding high-quality, local food at reasonable prices – “swakudya swo fihlula” which translates to affordable food.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **B: Fanichara yo hlawuleka ya khale** (Affordable antique furniture) - While the passage mentions old furniture (""fanichara ya khale""), it doesn't frame it as a *competitive* element or something guests specifically seek out for affordability.
* **C: Tindhawu leti hlayisiwaka kahle** (Well-maintained areas) - Maintaining the area is mentioned as a detail of the lodging, but not a primary competitive factor.
* **D: WiFi ya rivilo** (Reliable WiFi) - WiFi isn't mentioned at all in the passage.



"
"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki yin’wana ya timhakakulu ta mphikizano exikarhi ka ti-B&B ta manyunyu?","The correct answer is **D: Swakudya ni swakunwa leswi kumekaka endhawini yoleyo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that B&Bs compete strongly on two main things: ""swo funengela ha swona ni swakudya swo fihlula"" which translates to ""accommodation and local cuisine"". Option D directly reflects this - ""Swakudya ni swakunwa leswi kumekaka endhawini yoleyo"" means ""food and drinks available locally"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku sasekisa ka ntolovelo** (Supporting the economy) - While supporting the local economy is implied, it's not stated as a *direct* competition point.
*   **B: Swiphameriwa swa xifihlulo hikuya hi nguva** (Seasonal offers) - The passage mentions seasonal food, but doesn't frame seasonal *offers* as a core competitive factor.
*   **C: Swo funengela swa manyunyu** (Accommodation of lodges) -  The passage discusses accommodation generally, but the competition isn't about the *type* of accommodation (lodges vs. B&Bs) but the quality of what's offered *within* B&Bs.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga taka xi nga khomeriwi eBeijing hi 2022?","The correct answer is **B: Mitlangu ya le ayisini yo khomeriwa eTaizicheng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mintlangu yin’wana ya le ayisini yi ta khomeriwa eTaizicheng le Zhangjiakou..."" (One of the additional sports will be held in Taizicheng...).  The question asks what will *not* be held in Beijing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nkhuvo wo sungula mitlangu** - The passage says the opening *and* closing ceremonies will be in Beijing.
*   **C: Nkhuvo wo gimeta mitlangu** - The passage also states the closing ceremonies will be in Beijing.
*   **D: Mitlangu ya le ayisini endzeni ka miako** - This is not directly mentioned in the text, and the text specifically states *one* of the additional sports will be in Taizicheng.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga ta khomeriwa eBeijing hi 2022?","The correct answer is **A: Tiolimpiki ta ximumu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Doroba ra le Beijing eChayina ri ta rhurhela Mintlangu ya Tiolimpiki ya Xixika hi 2022..."" (Beijing, China will host the Winter Olympic Games in 2022...). It then further explains that Beijing will be the first city to host both Summer *and* Winter Olympics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mitlangu ya le ayisini endzeni ka miako:** While the passage mentions another site for *some* events, it doesn't say that *all* the auxiliary events will be held in Beijing.
*   **C: Tiolimpiki ta xixika:** The passage specifically states it's the *Winter* Olympics (Tiolimpiki ya Xixika).
*   **D: Mikhuvo yo gimeta mitlangu:** The passage mentions opening and closing ceremonies but doesn't state that is *all* that will be held in Beijing.



"
I mani loyi a nga le khombyeni lerikulu to ngheniwa hi mukhuhlwana wa swinyenyani,"The correct answer is **B: Vanhu lava tirhaka hi swiharhi leswi mamisaka** (People who work with poultry).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Swo tala a swi katsa vanhu lava tirhaka hi tihuku, kambe na khombo ri nga va kona eka vanhu lava rindzaka swinyenyani."" This translates to: ""It doesn't often affect people who work with birds, but there is a risk for people who are close to pigs.""  While the passage mentions a risk for people close to pigs, it *specifically* highlights a greater risk for those working with poultry (swiharhi leswi mamisaka - chickens, turkeys, etc.).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vavalangi va swinyenyani (Pig researchers):** The passage mentions a risk to people *near* pigs, but doesn't specify researchers.
* **C: Vanhu lava tirhaka hi tihuku (People who work with birds):** The passage states it *doesn't often* affect them.
* **D: Vanhu lava a wu va khomile eku sunguleni (People who didn't get sick at the beginning):** This is irrelevant to the passage's discussion of risk groups.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi landzeleka hi xihi lexi hlamuselaka kahle mukhuhlwana wa swinyenyani?","The correct answer is **A: Lava tirhaka hi tihuku hi vona ntsena lava ngheniweke hi mukhuhlwana lowu.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Swo tala a swi katsa vanhu lava tirhaka hi tihuku, kambe na khombo ri nga va kona eka vanhu lava rindzaka swinyenyani."" (It rarely affects people who work with poultry, but there is a risk for people who are close to pigs.) This directly supports option A, indicating those working with poultry are *more* likely to be affected.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage states it *rarely* affects humans, implying fewer human cases than pig cases, not the other way around.
* **C:** The passage doesn't mention researchers being at risk.
* **D:** The passage says *some* cases in humans are severe (""tin’wana ta tona ta dlaya""), not all.



"
Xana Lwandle Ro Basa–Baltic Canal ri hlanganisa yini?,"The correct answer is **C: Lwandle ra Arctic na Lwandle ra Baltic**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Lwandle Ro Basa–Balanti Canal yi hlanganisa Arctic Ocean na Lwandle Ra Baltic..."" (The White Sea–Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea...)



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi yihi ndlela yo teka tipasi handle ko kavanyeta mukhandziyi?","The correct answer is **B: Switimela leswi nga ni byetlelo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that at some train stations, you need a valid ticket to board, and the conductor might take tickets to prevent people from traveling without them.  The question asks how to take a pass *without* being checked by the conductor.  Train stations *with* platforms (switimela leswi nga ni byetlelo) are the places where conductors are likely to check tickets. Avoiding those stations would be a way to potentially avoid being checked.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Swihahampfhuka (Buses):** The passage mentions buses as a starting point for journeys, but doesn't relate them to avoiding ticket checks.
* **C: Swikepe (Ships):** Ships are mentioned similarly to buses – as a starting point, not related to ticket avoidance.
* **D: Switimela leswi tsemakanyaka mindzilakano (Trains that connect):**  These trains are specifically mentioned as *requiring* a ticket, making them the *opposite* of where you'd avoid being checked.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana ID ya wena yi nga ha kamberiwa rini eka switimela swin’wana leswi tsemakanyaka mindzilakano?","The correct answer is **B: Loko u etlele** (When you board).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Eka switimela leswi u nga tlelaka eka swona, mufambisi a nga ha teka tipasi leswaku mi nga kavanyetiwi loko mi etlele.""  This translates to: ""On the trains you board, the conductor might take tickets so you aren't caught when you board.""

Therefore, your ID (presumably used for ticketing) would be checked *when you board* the train.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Endzhaku ko xika exitimeleni** (Before getting off the train) - The passage doesn't mention checking ID when disembarking.
* **C: A swi kamberiwi** (It is not checked) - The passage explicitly states it *might* be checked.
* **D: Exitimeleni lexi fambaka** (On the moving train) - While conductors may walk through the train, the passage specifically links the check to the boarding process.



"
Eka swilo leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi ngopfungopfu xi nga tshukaka xi endleka loko u ri endhawini ya tithiropikhi le Singapore?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku karhatiwa hi ku hisa ka dyambu** (Being bothered by heat and humidity).

Here's why:

* **P's statement** directly warns about intense heat and humidity in Singapore (""Singapore yi hlayiseke swinene..."") and specifically mentions discomfort (""u nga xava kwalomu ka swilo hinkwaswo..."") and the potential for heatstroke (""ku hisa"") if precautions aren't taken.  The phrase about ""tithiropikhi leti tlakukeke"" (intense tropics) reinforces this. The mention of dyambu (humidity) further supports this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku tekeriwa swilo** (Being stolen from) - The passage doesn't mention theft.
* **B: Ku pfumala switolo** (Missing shops) - The passage is about the climate, not shopping.
* **D: Ku lahleka** (Getting lost) - While possible in any city, the passage doesn't focus on getting lost.



"
I mani loyi a nga tshukaka a lava ku papalata ku dya makhekhe ya le German?,"The correct answer is **D: Munhu loyi a rhandzaka swilo swo tsokombela kumbe tlula swo xawula** (Someone who likes sweet things or more than sour things).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes German cakes as being very sweet.** It specifically mentions apples, plums, almonds, hazelnuts, and other sweet ingredients. It even suggests pairing them with coffee (which is often enjoyed with something sweet).
* **Options A, B, and C are incorrect:**
    * **A:** While almonds are present, a nut allergy wouldn't make someone *want* to eat the cake.
    * **B:** The passage doesn't focus on complex desserts, just generally sweet cakes.
    * **C:** Chocolate isn't mentioned in the passage as a key ingredient.

Therefore, someone who generally enjoys sweet foods would be the most likely person to appreciate German cakes based on the description provided.



"
Hi xihi xilo lexi langutiwaka hi fambisana ni nguva eka makhekhe ya le German?,"The correct answer is **A: Maapula**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...makhekhe lama cheriweke mihandzu ma tolovelekile, ma va ma cheriwe **maapula lama swekiweke**, ticheri na tiplums leswi kumekaka hi ximumu.""  This directly links apples (""maapula"") to being *baked into* the cakes and being particularly loved, implying a traditional or time-honored pairing.

While plums, almonds, and hazelnuts are also mentioned as ingredients, they aren't specifically described as being traditionally *baked into* or strongly associated with German cakes in the way apples are.



"
"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki xibumabumelo xo famba hi ku pima matirhelo ya mali?","The correct answer is **D: Ku hunguta leswi xaviwaka tanihi swakudya ni byetlelo** (Reducing expenses like food and entertainment).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically mentions ""u hunguta matirhiselo ya wena ya mali""** (reducing your own use of money) as one of the ways to travel without getting into debt.  Reducing expenses on things like food and entertainment directly falls under this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku kuma swintirhwana hi nkarhi wo riendzo** (Getting side jobs during travel) - While possible, the passage doesn't mention this as a solution.
* **B: Ku cincacinca ntshamiseko wa wena** (Changing your lifestyle) - This is too broad; the passage focuses on *financial* adjustments.
* **C: Ku kombela mali eka vanhu** (Asking people for money) - The passage *warns against* exploiting others (""ku dyelela vanhu van’wana leswaku va vuyeriwa""), which is the opposite of asking for money responsibly.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi swi nga n’wi tikelaka ku famba hi ndlela yo pima swinene matirhelo ya mali?","The correct answer is **B: Munhu loyi a tsandzekaka ku titsona swilo** (A person who is eager to save things).

Here's why:

The passage describes people who want to use money without understanding budgeting or where their money goes. They are described as taking things that aren’t theirs, begging, and exploiting others. This points to a tendency to *take* and *not value* what they have, and therefore a need to learn to *save* and *be frugal*.  Someone eager to save (tsandzekaka ku titsona swilo) would be the opposite of this behavior and likely someone who would carefully manage their finances.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Munhu loyi a amukelaka ntlhontlho** (A person who accepts everything) - This doesn't relate to financial prudence.
*   **C: Munhu loyi a hlelaka ku tirhela ekule loko a ri eriendzweni** (A person who is willing to work hard when in need) - While hard work is good, it doesn’t necessarily mean they are good with money.
*   **D: Munhu loyi a tsakelaka ku landzelaka leswi tsariweke ehansi** (A person who likes to follow what is done below/by others) - This suggests someone easily influenced, not necessarily financially responsible.



"
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga yi hlamuseliki kahle ndlela ya le xikarhi ka Point Marion na Fairmont?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku tirhisiwa ka selifoni a ku nge vi xiphiqo** (Cell phone usage is unreliable).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that cell phone network coverage is *better* on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh route (including the Point Marion to Fairmont section) than in areas like the Pennsylvania Wilds. However, it also implies that even on this route, coverage isn't perfect and can be spotty (""network ya foni yi khoma swinene ku tlula..."").  This makes relying on a cell phone for navigation problematic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku ni mpfhuka wo leha exikarhi ka madoroba ya le kule** (There is a detour between the cities) - The passage doesn't mention any detours.
*   **B: Tindlela ti larile** (The roads are winding) - The passage does mention winding roads, but this isn't the primary difficulty highlighted.
*   **C: Mpimo wa rivilo a wu landzeriwi** (The speed limit is not enforced) - The passage specifically states the recommended speed (35-40 mph) and emphasizes following posted speed limits.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi hi xihi lexi faneleke ku vilerisa vachayeri lava fambaka egondzweni ra Buffalo-Pittsburg","The correct answer is **B: Ku pfumala ka vukorhokeri lebyinene bya foni.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that cell phone service is *stronger* on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh route compared to areas like the Pennsylvania Wilds. This is presented as a notable characteristic of this route, and therefore something drivers should be aware of.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku hlwerisiwa hi ntlimbano wa mimovha (Being disrupted by animal crossings)** - The passage mentions deer, swerving, and potential collisions, but doesn't frame it as a primary thing to *expect* on this route.
*   **C: Ku jika swinene hi rivilo (Driving with a lot of turns)** - While the passage mentions speed limits and careful driving, it doesn't highlight excessive turns as a key feature.
*   **D: Ku hlangana ni ku akiwa ka patu nkarhi ni nkarhi (Frequent stops and delays)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about regular stops or delays.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga lavekiki eka ntlangu wa canyoneering?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku tiletela loku nga nyawuriki** (Unnecessary risk-taking).

Here's why:

The text specifically states canyoning requires training and skill (""u lava leswaku u va u leteriwile kumbe u va u hanye kahle""). It contrasts canyoning with reckless activities like cliff jumping or swimming in fast-flowing rivers.  Taking unnecessary risks is *not* part of safe and proper canyoneering.

Let's look at why the other options are part of canyoneering:

*   **A: Vuswokoti byo hlambela (Swimming skills):** The text says canyoning *includes* swimming (""ku hlambela"").
*   **B: Xiyimo xa miri lexinene (Confined spaces):** The description mentions navigating narrow spaces (""xinkobyana"").
*   **C: Vuswikoti byo tlula (Climbing skills):** The text says canyoning *includes* climbing (""ku khandziya"").



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga lavekaka eka pfhumba ra canyoneering?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku va ni xitifiketi xa canyoneering (Having a canyoneering certificate)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that canyoneering *requires* being trained or skilled – ""leswaku u wu endla wu lava leswaku u va u leteriwile kumbe u va u hanye kahle"". A certificate demonstrates that training and skill.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vuswokoti lebyikulu bya matsambu (Strong muscles of the legs):** While helpful, strong legs alone aren't enough. Canyoneering involves technical skills.
* **B: Ntokoto wa scuba diving (Scuba diving equipment):** Canyoneering doesn't necessarily involve being underwater; it can be done in dry canyons.
* **D: Vuswikoti byo hlambela (Swimming skills):**  Swimming is *part* of canyoneering, but not the only requirement, and the passage differentiates it from general swimming.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga pfunaka eka loyi a hlelaka ku dzima tendze a ri emovheni wakwe?","The correct answer is **C: Tende**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ku dzima tende endhawini yin’wana kumbe edorobeni lerikulu swi nga ku kokela mahlo hi ku olova."" (Parking/setting up a tent in another place or a big city can attract attention by being conspicuous).  The passage is discussing the challenges and risks of *discreetly* traveling and camping with your vehicle, and the tent is the key element being hidden or set up inconspicuously.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku twisisa swinene ku tsana ka movha wa wena (Understanding the size of your vehicle):** While understanding your vehicle's size is mentioned (relating to being able to fit a large tent), it's not the *thing* that attracts attention.
*   **B: Movha laha u kotaka ku etlerisa switshamo (Vehicle where you can fit belongings):** The passage discusses fitting belongings, but doesn't suggest that's the primary concern.
*   **D: Ndhawu ya munhu yo kota ku dzima tende (A place where a person can set up a tent):** The passage emphasizes *where* you set up the tent is the issue (discreetly or not), not just finding a place to do so.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, lava dzimaka matende emimovheni va fanele ku papalata yini loko va lava ku laha ku nga riki na swikavanyeto?","The correct answer is **A: Ku famba hi movha lowukulu, wo fana na SUV kumbe vheni** (Traveling by a large vehicle, such as an SUV or van).

Here's why:

The passage states: *""Ku etlela emovheni swa koteka loko u ri ni movha lowukulu wo tanihi vheni, SUV, Sedan kumbe Station Wagon lowu nga ni switulu leswi etlerisiwaka.""* (It is easier to park a vehicle if you have a large vehicle like a van, SUV, Sedan or Station Wagon with parking assist features.)  This directly relates to being able to park when there are no parking spaces available – a large vehicle is *more capable* of fitting into difficult spots.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku teka riendzo ro leha hi patu** (Taking a walk) – While a good alternative, the passage doesn't suggest walking as a solution to parking.
* **C: Ku dzima tende edorobeni kumbe etindhawini leyi tiyimeleke** (Parking in a town or a busy area) –  The passage actually warns *against* this, saying it can be frustrating.
* **D: Ku pfumala ku tolovela movha lowu va wu tirhisaka** (Getting used to the vehicle you use) – While helpful in general, it doesn’t directly address the problem of finding parking.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi a pfuxeteke Casablanca ra vumbirhi?","The correct answer is **B: Vaxavisi va le Spaniya**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Casablanca i yin’wana ya tindhawu leti nga le hansi swinene hi ku tsakisa loko u lava ku xava eMorocco...naswona yi nyikiwe vito ra Casablanca hi va xavisi vale Spaniya lava sunguleke ndhawu yo xavisa eka yona kwalani.""  This directly translates to ""Casablanca is one of the most beautiful cities to visit in Morocco...and was given the name Casablanca by Spanish explorers who began to explore the area.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maputukezi:** While the text mentions the Portuguese destroyed the city and built under Casa Branca, it doesn't say they *named* it.
*   **C: VaMerenid:** The text doesn't mention the Merenids in relation to naming Casablanca.
*   **D: Sultan ya le Morocco:** The Sultan rebuilt the city and called it Daru I-Badya, but the name Casablanca came from the Spanish.



"
I vamani lava siyeke doroba ra manguva lawa ra Casablanca endzhaku ka mhangu ya ntumbuluko?,"The correct answer is **B: Maputukezi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Maputukezi va ri hlaserile va tlhela va aka hi vuntswa ehansi ka Casa Branca, va tlhela va ri tshika endzhaku ko tseka tseka ka misava hi 1755."" This directly translates to ""The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it in a lower area under Casa Branca, and they abandoned it in ruins in 1755."" 

Therefore, the Portuguese were the ones who left the old city of Casablanca after the earthquake.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana Sintra ri lemukiwe ximfumo hi ndlela yihi exikarhi ka vanhu va matiko mambe?","The correct answer is **C: Swibumabumelo leswinene swa Lord Byron**.

Here's why:

The passage states Sintra became famous ""when it was immortalized by Lord Byron."" This directly links Sintra's recognition to Lord Byron's writings and influence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cabo da Roca:** While the bus route goes to Cabo da Roca, it doesn’t explain *why* Sintra is known internationally.
*   **B: Laha Mariya a humelelaka kona:** This refers to Fatima, a separate location, not Sintra.
*   **D: Matimu ya rona yo rhandzeka:** This is too vague and doesn’t pinpoint a specific reason for international fame.



"
I yini lexi nga amukeriwiki hi Armenia?,"The correct answer is **A: Ndhawu ya Nagorno-Karabakh**.

Here's why:

The passage states Armenia supports the self-proclaimed republic in Nagorno-Karabakh, which is *within* Azerbaijan.  This is the core of the conflict – Armenia's backing of a region claiming independence *from* Azerbaijan. The passage implies Armenia doesn't recognize Azerbaijan's sovereignty over that area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nyimpi yo lwa ni Vaazeri** - While Armenia is involved in conflict with Azerbaijan, the passage doesn't say Armenia *objects* to the conflict itself, only that it began due to the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh.
*   **C: Marito ya xidipulomati ya Azerbaijan** - The passage states diplomatic efforts have failed, but doesn't indicate Armenia specifically objects to Azerbaijan's diplomacy.
*   **D: Rhiphabuliki lerintshwa** - Armenia *supports* the new republic, it doesn't find it unacceptable.



"
I yini lexi hambetaka xi kavanyeta vuxaka exikarhi ka Azerbaijan na Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: Ndhawu ya Nagorno-Karabakh**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ndhawu leyi tshaka hi Vaarmeniya ya Nagorno-Karabakh eAzerbaijan yi sungule nyimpi..."" (This disputed area of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan sparked a war...).  The entire conflict revolves around this territory.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vaarmeniya lava tshamaka le Azerbaijan:** While Armenians are involved, the *area* is the core issue, not just their presence.
* **B: Nyimpi ya 1994:** The war is a *result* of the dispute, not the cause itself.
* **C: Marito ya xidipulomati:**  Diplomatic efforts are trying to *resolve* the conflict, not cause it.

"Loko u tirhisa thekisi eCharlotte, i yini lexi nga vangelaka hakelo leyi engetelekeke?","The correct answer is **A: Ku tshama endhawini yin’wana** (Living in a different area).

The passage states ""Vanhu va le tindhawini tin’wana hakanyingi va tshaha ku tshamiseka-ka ndyangu tanihi xona xivangelo nkulu xo ya tshama kwalaho..."" This translates to ""People from some areas often prefer to take a taxi because it is a major reason to live there.""  This directly links taking a taxi to *living in a different area* and wanting to reach Uptown Charlotte.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku va ni vakhandziyi vanharhu** (Being tourists) - While tourists might use taxis, the passage focuses on residents.
* **C: Ku ya eUptown** (Going to Uptown) -  Uptown is a *destination*, not a *reason* for the increased cost.
* **D: Ku lulamela ndyangu** (Waiting for the train) - The passage mentions the train but not as a reason for increased taxi fares. It implies the train isn't always convenient.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga tekiwaka xi nga ri xinene hi ku tshama ni vana eCharlotte?","The correct answer is **D: Ku ringeta ku tiphina hi doroba**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""vayeni va tala ku tiphina eka doroba loko va famba na vana endhawini yoleyo."" This directly translates to ""many visitors look for places to stay in the city when traveling with children in that area.""  The passage highlights this as a common practice due to the area being attractive for families.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mitsengo ya tiyindlu (Housing costs):** While the passage mentions rising costs, it doesn't specifically link this to concerns about traveling *with* children.
*   **B: Ku famba hi thekisi (Taxi travel):** The passage mentions the expense of traveling in pairs but doesn't focus on taxi travel as a major concern.
*   **C: Vatshami va tindhawu tin’wana (Residents of other areas):**  The passage mentions residents moving *to* Charlotte, not concerns about them, in relation to families traveling.



"
"Loko va le Spaniya va nga si fika, i mani loyi a a lawula xiphemu xa le n’walungwini xa Chile?","The correct answer is **A: Mapuche**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""n’walungu wa Chile a wu fumiwa hi mfumo wa Inca naswona Maarucania (Mapuche) a va tshama exikarhi ni le dzongeni wa le Chile."" This translates to ""the territory of Chile was not conquered by the Inca empire and the Mapuche (Araucanians) lived in the south of Chile.""  Therefore, the Mapuche were the ones in control of the region before the Spanish arrived.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Maamerika** - This is too broad. The Mapuche are a specific group *within* the Americas.
*   **C: Maaraucania** - This is another name for the Mapuche people, not a ruling entity.
*   **D: Mainca** - The text specifically states the Inca did *not* conquer the region.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga endlekangiki hi 1810?","The correct answer is **A: A ku pfumaleka hulumendhe ya le xikarhi**.

Here's why:

The text states that Chile declared independence in 1810 *because* the Napoleonic Wars left Spain with less control over its colonies.  However, it *also* states that Spain wasn't actually defeated militarily until 1818. This means that in 1810, while a declaration was made, there was no central government in power to fully implement that independence - Spain still held authority.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Chile ri hlule Spain** - The text specifically says Spain wasn't defeated until 1818.
*   **C: A ku lwiwa tinyimpi ta Napoleon** - The text says the Napoleonic wars *caused* the situation, not that they didn't happen.
*   **D: Chile ri tivise ntshunxeko** - The text states Chile *declared* independence, but it wasn't fully achieved or recognized yet.



"
Xana vanhu va nga fikelela miti ya le kule endhawini ya Liguria?,"The correct answer is **B: Hi movha kumbe xitimela**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tindlela, switimela na mabyatso swi hlanganisa matiko xikaya lama..."" which translates to ""Paths, trains, and boats connect the villages...""  This directly indicates that people can reach the villages by train or boat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hi movha kumbe xikepe** - While boats (xikepe) are mentioned, the passage specifically mentions *trains* as well.
*   **C: Hi xitimela kumbe xikepe** - Correct, but B is a better answer as it utilizes the language of the text in the same order.
*   **D: Hi xihahampfhuka kumbe xitimela** -  ""Xihahampfhuka"" (helicopter) is not mentioned in the passage.



"
Xana marito ya Xintariyana lama nge ‘Cinque Terre’ ma vula yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Tindhawu ta ntlhanu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Cinque Terre, leswi vulaka **Tindhawu Ta Ntlhanu**..."" which directly translates to ""Cinque Terre, which means **Five Lands/Places**..."" 

Therefore, ""Cinque Terre"" literally means ""Five Lands"" or ""Five Places"" in the local language.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i tibutsu ta muxaka wihi lexi lulameleke vuxaka lebyi nga vangelaka ku rheta?","The correct answer is **A: Tibutsu leti nga ni swirhendze swo lala** (Tubes with low grooves).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ti hili ti fanele ti va tale ehansi no anama. Sava, giravhele kumbe munyu (khalisiyamu tlilorayidi) swi tala ku hangalasiwa emapatwini leswaku ku antwisiwa ku khomelela."" This means the tubes should have shallow grooves to allow for grip (using soap, gravel, or salt) to prevent slipping.  ""Swirhendze swo lala"" translates to ""low grooves"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tibutsu leti nga tisolo** (Tubes with soles) - The text mentions soles as a *feature* to add, not as an inherent characteristic of good tubes.
* **C: Tibutsu leti nga ni swirhendze swo leha** (Tubes with high grooves) -  The text specifically says the grooves should be shallow (""tale ehansi"").
* **D: Tibutsu to pfumala phateni yo enta 1/5 inch** (Tubes that fill a 1/5 inch gap) - This refers to the *width* of the gap the tubes should fill, not a characteristic *of* the tubes themselves.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi nga taka xi nga pfuni emapatwini ya ayisi hi xixika?,"The correct answer is **A: Munyu**.

The text states: ""Sava, giravhele kumbe munyu (khalisiyamu tlilorayidi) swi tala ku hangalasiwa emapatwini leswaku ku antwisiwa ku khomelela."" This translates to ""Salt, gravel or sand (calcium chloride) are often spread on roads to prevent freezing.""

Therefore, salt is one of the things that is used on roads during winter/icy conditions.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi fanaka exikarhi ka Hawaii na Swihlala swa Cook?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti tirhisa nkarhi wa wachi lowu fanaka**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Leswi swi tirhisaka nkarhi wo fana ni wa le Hawaii..."" which directly translates to ""They use the same time as Hawaii...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ha timbirhi ti ni tihotela to tala letikulu** - The text specifically says the Cook Islands *don't* have large hotels.
*   **B: Ha timbirhi ti hava mifumo** - The text doesn't mention whether or not Hawaii has systems.
*   **D: Ha timbirhi ti hava madoroba** - The text states the Cook Islands don't have cities, but doesn't say the same about Hawaii.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi nga hlamuseriki hi ku kongoma Cook Islands?,"The correct answer is **A: Yi tsanana eka Hawaii**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ku pfa ku ehleketiwa leswaku swihlala leswi swi le “hansi ka Hawaii”"" (it is often said that these islands are “below Hawaii”). This directly compares the Cook Islands to Hawaii in terms of location and potentially, development.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I nongonoko wa swihlala:** While the passage says it's made up of 15 islands, it doesn't define it *as* a collection of islands – it *is* a country composed of them.
* **C: Madorobakulu i Rarotonga na Aitutaki:** The passage states Rarotonga and Aitutaki are the main islands, not cities. It also explicitly says the Cook Islands *don't* have cities.
* **D: Tiko leri ra le xihlaleni ri tirhisa nkarhi lowu fanaka na Hawaii:** While it *does* share a similar time zone with Hawaii, this isn’t the main defining characteristic described in the passage when comparing it to Hawaii. The comparison is about its location and perceived positioning relative to Hawaii.



"
Eka tindhawu ta varindzi va swiharhi leti landzelaka hi tihi lexi nga ni mixaka yimbirhi ya byetlelo?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

The text states: ""Sirena i ndhawu yin’we ntsena leyi ku tshamaka varindzi va swiharhi leyi nyikaka vanhu ndhawu yo tlela ni swakudya swo hisa ku engetela eka ku khempa."" (Sirena is one of the stations where park rangers are stationed and provides people with a place to sleep and food to help with camping.)

The question asks for a ranger station that provides accommodation. Sirena is explicitly stated to do so. The other options are listed as camping spots *receiving* supplies, not providing them.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi kwihi laha u nga kumaka mpfumelelo wa le ntangeni loko u lava ku tirhisa mali hi ku kongoma ematshan’weni ya xikweleti?","The correct answer is **B: Puerto Jiménez**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""U nga swi kota ku kombela mpfumelelo hi ku kongoma eka kwale Ndhawini ya Marhenja e**Puerto Jiménez**, kambe a va teki khadi ra xikweleti (credit cards)."" 

This means you *can* get a permit by paying with cash at the Marhenja District office in Puerto Jiménez, even though they don't accept credit cards. The other options are incorrect:

*   **Sirena:** The text says you need a permit *to get to* Sirena, but doesn't say you can *get* the permit there.
*   **CafeNet El Sol:** Offers internet access for a fee, but doesn't issue permits.
*   **La Leona:** Listed as a campsite, doesn't mention permit issuance.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i muxaka wihi wa ntlangu wa ku rheta lowu tlangiwaka eswintshabyanini?","The correct answer is **D: Ku rheta u ri ni bege leyi tikaka**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Wa yelana ni wo rheta eka gamboko endhawini leri rhelelaka kumbe leri nga ni tintshava ,yinw’ana yi endliwa eswigangeni laha swilavaka switirhisiwa leswi tiyeke ni tibuntsu. ... Loko swiyimo swi ri kahle u ta kota ku fika ekule ku tlula loko u famba kunene- kambe a swi talanga leswaku u nga ta kota ku famba hi rivilo loko u rheta u ri ni bege leyitikaka."" This directly translates to needing a specific type of bag (bege leyitikaka) when climbing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku haha emoyeni (Breathing air)** - While important for climbing, it's not a specific requirement *of the climb itself* mentioned in the text.
* **B: Ku rheta etindhawini ta le kule ni doroba (Climbing in high and urban areas)** - The passage doesn't specify *where* the climb is, only its difficulty and the need for a bag.
* **C: Ku khandziya tintshava u tamele switirhisiwa (Avoiding obstacles to use tools)** - This is mentioned as a potential situation but isn't the core requirement of the climb.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga pfunaka vavalangi lava rhetaka lava lavaka ku fikelela rivilo ra le henhla?","The correct answer is **B: Bege leyi tikaka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Loko swiyimo swi ri kahle u ta kota ku fika ekule ku tlula loko u famba kunene- kambe a swi talanga leswaku u nga ta kota ku famba hi rivilo loko u rheta u ri ni bege leyitikaka.""  This translates to: ""If conditions are good you will be able to reach the top more easily than if you walk straight - but it does not mean you won't be able to walk around if you climb with a suitable bag.""

This clearly indicates that having a *suitable bag (bege leyitikaka)* is crucial for being able to navigate around obstacles (like a river) while climbing. The passage doesn't emphasize tools (tibutsu), general conditions (swiyimo), or established paths (tindlela).

Vafambi lava hlangahlanganaka hikwalaho ko va eka ndhavuko wun’wana va tikeriwa hi ku endla yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku tolovela ndhavuko wa ndhawu leyintshwa** (To adapt to the new culture).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Vafambi lava swi nga va olovela ku tolovela ndhavuko lowuntshwa swi nga va tikela nkarhi wunwana ku tlhela va tolovela ndhavuko wa rikwavo.""  This translates to ""Travelers who are unable to adapt to the new culture may take some time to continue adapting to their own culture.""  This clearly indicates that travelers are *expected* to adapt to the new culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku lehisa mbilu ni ku twisisa** (To be welcomed and understood) - While important, the passage focuses on the *travelers'* responsibility to adapt, not on others welcoming them.
* **C: Ku ya entsungeni** (To go exploring) - This isn't mentioned as a requirement or expectation.
* **D: Ku tlhela va tolovela ndhavuko wa ka vona** (To continue adapting to their own culture) - This is what happens *if* they struggle to adapt to the new culture, not what they are initially expected to do.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, ku hlangahlangana ku nga ha tika swinene eka mufambi wa muxaka muni?","The correct answer is **A: Vafambi lava tikeriwaka hi ku tolovela ndhavuko lowuntshwa (Travellers who are forced to adapt to a new culture)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the difficulty and importance of adapting to a new culture.** It talks about the time and effort it takes, the potential for feeling lost, and the need for understanding from others.  It highlights the struggles of fitting in and the eventual integration of new cultural perspectives.
* **Option A directly addresses this central theme.**  Those *forced* to adapt would most strongly relate to the experiences described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Vafambi lava hatlisaka va tolovela ku hanya entsungeni (Travellers who quickly adapt to speaking a different language):** While language is *part* of culture, the passage is broader than just language.
* **C: Vafambi va ha ri eka xiyimo xa ntsako lowukulu (Travellers who are not in a great emotional state):**  The passage doesn't focus on emotional state, but the *process* of cultural adaptation.
* **D: Vafambi lava nga kotiki ku lehisa mbilu (Travellers who cannot express themselves):**  The passage mentions the importance of *being able* to express yourself and be understood, but it's not the primary focus.  



"
Eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi vanhu va nga fanelangiki ku xi endla hi moose?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku xi tshinelela hi ku nonoka** (To approach it slowly/gently).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...loko vanhu va vona onge xiharhi lexi xa moose a xi na khombo, va nga ha xi tshinelela ngopfu ivi swi va veka ekhombyeni."" (When people see this animal, a moose with a calf, they should approach it very carefully so it doesn't feel threatened.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku honisa vukona bya xona** (To disturb its anger) - The passage implies avoiding provoking it.
* **C: Ku tekela ehansi nxungeto wa xona** (To underestimate its threat) - The passage suggests taking it seriously.
* **D: Ku swi languta u ri ekule** (To shout that it's young) - This is irrelevant to the passage's advice.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi malunghana ni moose hi xihi lexi nga riki ntiyiso?","The correct answer is **B: Nkarhi wun’wana a swi tekiwi swi ri nxungeto.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Loko vanhu va vona onge xiharhi lexi xa moose a xi na khombo, va nga ha xi tshinelela ngopfu ivi swi va veka ekhombyeni."" This means people *sometimes* mistake it for a moose, not that it *always* happens.  Therefore, it's not a guaranteed characteristic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I swiharhi swa vukarhi hi ntumbuluko:** The passage directly states this - it resembles a moose and elk in appearance.
* **C: Swi nga ha titwa swi xungetiwa loko vanhu va swi tshinelela:** The passage says it *is* mistaken (xungetiwa) when people see it.
* **D: Swa tilwela loko swi boha:** The passage states it fights when attacked (xa ti lwela loko xi titwa xi xungetiwa).

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi swihi leswi nga na khombo leri nga nyawuriki eka mufambi wa le mananga?","The correct answer is **C: Ku heta matimba u ri karhi u landzelela miraji**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""...swi nga ni khombo loko mufambi a sukela timaraji, a tlanga hi matimba ya nkoka na mati lama saleke."" This translates to ""...it is dangerous if a traveler leaves the mirages, and struggles with strong winds and scattered water.""  This directly links the danger (khombo) to *struggling/exhausting oneself* (heta matimba) while following the mirages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku pfumala swiambalo swo kufumela evusikwini byo titimela** - While the passage mentions darkness at night, it doesn't say stumbling over things is the *danger* specifically related to the mirages.
* **B: Ku vona miraji leyi langutekaka onge i mati** - Seeing the mirage isn't the danger *itself*, it's what happens *after* trying to reach it.
* **D: Ku heta mati u ri karhi u landzelela miraji** - The passage specifically mentions *winds* (matimba) not water (mati) as the struggle.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi boxiwiki tanihi nxungeto eka vafambi va le mananga?,"The correct answer is **B: Timiraji**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that travelers *see mirages* (timiraji) which can be mistaken for water or other things. It then goes on to describe the danger of following these mirages, leading to exhaustion and dehydration. The entire passage centers around the deceptive nature of mirages in the hot, dry landscape.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku pfumaleka ka mati (Dehydration):** While dehydration is a *result* of being misled by the mirages, it's not the initial danger or the thing travelers see.
* **C: Ku khomiwa hi xirhami (Being bitten by an animal):** This isn't mentioned in the passage at all.
* **D: Ku hisiwa hi dyambu (Being lost/disoriented):**  While travelers *can* get lost, the passage specifically focuses on the mirages as the source of the problem.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi vahi vanhu lava khumbekeke swinene endzhaku ka ku fika ka vavalangi?","The correct answer is **C: Mataino**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hi kuvula ka Fray Bartolomé de las Casas... vahluri va le eSpaniya va dlaye kwalomu ka 100,000 wa Mataíno."" This directly indicates that the Taíno people suffered greatly – 100,000 died – due to the arrival of the Spanish colonizers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vanhu va le Haiti** - While the Dominican Republic shares an island with Haiti, the text specifically details the impact on the Taíno.
*   **B: Makharabiya** - The text mentions the Caribs arriving much earlier (10,000 BCE) and doesn't detail significant losses *because of* the Spanish arrival.
*   **D: Va le Spaniya** - The Spanish were the colonizers *causing* the deaths, not the ones suffering them.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi rihi rimi leri vulavuriwaka hi Makharabiya?","The correct answer is **D: Xiarawakan**.

The text states: ""MaKharibiya a va ri vanhu lava vulavulaka Xiawaraka lava fikeke kwalomu ka 10,000 BCE."" This directly translates to ""The Caribbean people were people who spoke Xiawaraka who arrived here around 10,000 BCE.""
"
I mani loyi a endleke leswaku ku rheta egambokweni ku duma tanihi ntlangu wo tihungasa?,"The correct answer is **B: Vanorwegia**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...hilembexidzana ra vu 17 na hi 1861 clilabu yo sungula yi pfule hi vanorwegia eAustraliya."" This translates to ""...in the 17th century and in 1861 the first clubs were founded by Norwegians in Australia.""  This indicates the Norwegians were the first to formally establish and popularize the practice, leading to it being known as a sport.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ski bums:** This is a term used *to describe people who enjoy the sport*, not the originators.
*   **C: Lava tshamaka ebakweni:** (People who live in the mountains) - While it's likely people in mountainous regions practiced similar activities, the text doesn't attribute the *formalization* of the sport to them.
*   **D: Va le Australia:** (People from Australia) - The Norwegians *introduced* the clubs to Australia, they didn't originate the sport there.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i nkarhi wihi laha ku rheta egambokweni ku sunguleke ku tekiwa tanihi ntlangu?","The correct answer is **C: 1861**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...swi sungule hilembexidzana ra vu 17 na hi 1861 clilabu yo sungula yi pfule hi vanorwegia eAustraliya."" This directly translates to ""...it began in the 17th century and in 1861 the first club was founded by Norwegians in Australia.""  While it *started* in the 17th century with experimentation, 1861 marks the beginning of it being taken up as an organized *sport/activity* (a ""ntlangu"" in this context).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lembexidzana ra vu-18 (18th Century):** While related, the text specifies 1861 as the founding of the first club.
*   **B: 5000 BC:** This refers to ancient cave paintings depicting similar activities, *not* the start of surfing as a formalized practice.
*   **D: Lembexidzana ra vu-17 (17th Century):** This is when experimentation began, but not when it was officially taken up as a ""ntlangu"".



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi fambisanaka ni xihlala lexikulu xa le ribuweni ra vuxa bya Afrika?,"The correct answer is **C: Swiharhi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Madagascar hi xona lexikulu xa kona, naswona i tiko nkulu hi roxe loko swi ta eka **swiharhi**."" This directly links Madagascar (the largest island) to its size in relation to the Indian Ocean.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nkucetelo wa le Yuropa** - While European exploration is mentioned, it doesn't define the largest island.
*   **B: Vukhongeri bya Vuisilamu** - Islam's influence is discussed, but it doesn't relate to the largest island.
*   **D: Tindhawu ta vaendzi ta manyunyu** - These are smaller islands, not the largest one.



"
Hi xihi lexi nga riki xihlawulekisi xa swihlala leswitsongo swa Afrika Vuxa? ,"The correct answer is **D: Ku tiyimela handle ka matiko man’wana** (Being independent from other countries).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Swihlala swo Tala leswitsongo i matiko lama tiyimeleke, kumbe lama hlanganeke na Furwa, naswona swi tiveka tanihi mabuwu ya manyunyu."" This translates to ""The scattered island states are countries that are independent, or connected to France, and they appear as pearls of the ocean.""  The passage *specifically* mentions that some are independent and others are connected to France (not independent).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vuxaka na Furwa (Culture and France):** While French influence is mentioned, it doesn’t describe a defining characteristic of *all* the island states.
* **B: Tindhawu ta vaendzi ta manyunyu to tala (Many beautiful tourist destinations):** The passage mentions them appearing like ""pearls"" implying beauty, but doesn’t focus on them *being* tourist destinations.
* **C: Ndhuma ya ku va ni swiharhi (The challenge of having limited resources):** Madagascar is mentioned as the largest, implying resource differences, but this isn't a general characteristic of all the islands.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana Xilalelo xa Hosi xi tlangeriwa njhani ngopfungopfu hi tikereke tin’wana leti tolovelekeke?","The correct answer is **B: Ku endla murindzelo wa Mugqivela nivusiku** (To hold a vigil on Maundy Thursday night).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tikereke to tala titolovele ku khoma Xilalelo Xa Hosi hi vusiku bya Muqhivela wa mahelovhiki ya Xilalelo Xa Hosi..."" This directly translates to ""Many churches prefer to commemorate the Last Supper on the night of Maundy Thursday...""  Holding a vigil (murindzelo) is a common way to commemorate something, especially over a night.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku endla nkhuvo wo veleka** (To perform a veiling ceremony) - While the text mentions a veil, it doesn't say this is *how* the Last Supper is remembered.
* **C: Ku va ni xinkhubyana xa ximun’wana xa kereke** (To be a gathering of a church member) - This doesn't describe the commemoration itself.
* **D: Ku hlalela dyambu loko ri xa** (To wait for the shadow when it falls) - This refers to the visual aspect of the event being observed at a specific location, not the actual practice of remembering the Last Supper.

"Ku papalata swilaveko swin’wana loko u nghena aEcuador, muaki wa le Cuba u fanele a rhanga a va na yini?","The correct answer is **B: Papila ra xirhambo ra ximfumo**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Papila leri ri fanele ri vekiwa enawini hi Vutirheli byo Timhaka tale Handle byale Ecuador."" (A travel document must be obtained at the Ecuadorian consulate.) This is the primary requirement for Cuban citizens entering Ecuador.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Phasipoto leri tirhaka tin’hweti ta 6 endzhaku ka masiku ya ku famba** - While a valid passport is needed, the text focuses specifically on the *travel document* in addition to the passport.
*   **C: Thikithi ro komba leswaku tshame masiku mangani** - This is needed *after* arrival, to demonstrate length of stay, not for initial entry.
*   **D: Khadi ra rihlaza ra le US** - This is only relevant for Cubans *with* a US green card and requires further processing at the Ecuadorian Immigration Office, it's not a general requirement for all Cubans.



"
Xana i yini leswi swilaveko swa ku famba swa le Ecuador swi nga endleriwangiki swona?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku tiyisisa masiku lawa mufambi a nga ta ma tshama** (Confirming the number of days the traveler will stay).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Loko u vuya u fanele u va na tikhithi leri nga ta komba leswaku u tshame masiku mangani."" (When you return, you must have a ticket showing how many days you will stay.) This directly relates to confirming the duration of the stay.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku pima nhlayo ya vafambi yi nga tali** (Measuring the weight of passengers is not mentioned) - The text doesn't mention anything about passenger weight.
*   **B: Ku famba hi ndlela leyi hlelekeke** (Traveling in a risky manner) - The text focuses on legal entry requirements, not the method of travel.
*   **D: Ku tiyisisa vutirhiseki bya tiphasipoto** (Confirming the validity of passports) - While a passport is mentioned, the focus is on its 6-month validity timeframe, not a general validity check.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga durhaka etikweni rin’wana ku tlula ekaya?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndzindzakhombo wo hakelela matihlo**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Maghilazi yo durha lama u nga ma kumaka kwalaho ma nga va na swiphiqo swimbirhi; ma nga ha va ma nga ri ya ntiyiso naswona loko ma ri ya ntiyiso ma nga durha ku tlula laha u humaka kona hileswi ma nga lo rhumeriwa."" This translates to ""Goods are expensive where you find two problems; they may not be available and if they are available they are expensive compared to where you come from because they are imported.""  The passage then directly mentions the benefit of bringing your own goods (matihlo) *if you have the resources to transport them* (ndzindzakhombo wo hakelela matihlo).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Swikambelo swa mahlo:** (Visas) While visas are needed for travel, the passage focuses on the cost of *goods* being higher, not the cost of travel documents.
*   **B: Tifiremu to durha:** (Expensive fees) Fees could contribute to cost, but the passage focuses on the cost of the goods themselves.
*   **D: Tifiremu to pfumala mavito ya ndhuma:** (Fees to clear customs)  Customs fees are a component of cost, but the passage explains the overall higher cost of goods *after* they've been imported.



"
Hi rihi khombo leri nga vangiwaka hi ku xava tifiremu to durha eka tiko rin’wana?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku nga ha laveka xikambelo xa mahlo lexi engetelekeke** (You may need an extended eye exam).

Here's why:

The passage discusses the challenges of getting glasses when traveling and the potential differences in prescriptions between countries, especially when economies are struggling. It specifically mentions needing to *bring your own glasses* if you have a prescription and want to ensure they're made correctly (""loko u ri na ndzindzakhombo wo hakelela matihlo"").  This implies that a standard exam might not be sufficient when dealing with international prescriptions or potential issues with local optical services.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Papila ra dokodela swi nga endleka ri nga tirhi eka tifuremu tin’wana** (A doctor's prescription might work at some stores) - While true, this doesn't address the core issue of potential prescription differences and quality concerns raised in the passage.
* **C: Ti nga ha tshuka ti nga vi ta xiviri** (They might be cheap, they might be expensive) -  Price is mentioned indirectly (due to the economy), but it’s not the central concern. The focus is on accuracy and quality.
* **D: Ndzindzakhombo wu nga ha tshuka wu nga hakeleli swikoxo** (A prescription might be lost and unable to be corrected) - This is a separate logistical issue, not the reason for bringing your own glasses as discussed in the passage.

"Malunghana ni ku tirhisiwa ka mali eFalklands, eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga ntiyiso?","The correct answer is **D: Handle ka pound ya le Falkland, pound ya le Britain hakanyingi i mali leyi amukeriwaka**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ko tala Pound ya le Britain yi xava kun’wani na kun’wani eswihlaleni..."" (Pound of Britain is widely accepted in town...) This directly supports the idea that the British pound is commonly used.
* **The passage also states:** ""...mali leyi vuriwaka Falkland pound (FKP) leyi ringanaka ni pound ya le Britain (GBP)."" (The currency used is the Falkland pound (FKP) which is equivalent to the British pound (GBP)). This establishes a strong link and interchangeability.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While credit cards *are* accepted, the passage says they *might* not be, making ""Ku amukeriwa"" (are accepted) too strong of a statement.
* **B:** The passage states dollars *are* accepted in Stanley, not that Stanley is the *only* place.
* **C:** The passage suggests changing money *while in* the Falklands is best, not necessarily that you *must* change it before leaving.



"
"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, loko u ya eFalklands ku suka eUnited States, hi kwhi laha ndlela yin’wana yo hakela yi nga pfunaka swinene ku tlula khadi ra xikweleti?","The correct answer is **A: Exitolo xa FIC West**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko tala Pound ya le Britain yi xava kun’wani na kun’wani eswihlaleni naswona makhadi ya swikweleti (credit cards) ni dolara ya le United State na swona swa xava eStanley. Swi nga endleka makhadi ya swikweleti ma nga amukeriwi... kutani cincisa mali u nga si suka eswihlaleni.""  It specifically mentions that exchanging money *at* the FIC West shop is a good idea.  This implies it's a reliable place to get Falkland Pounds, and therefore a better option than relying solely on credit cards which might not be accepted everywhere.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Eswihlaleni hinkwaswo:** Too broad. While British Pounds and US dollars are accepted in Stanley, the text highlights a specific location for exchange.
* **C: Eswihlaleni swa le kule:** This doesn't relate to the advice given in the passage.
* **D: Endhawini hinkwayo ya Stanely:** Too broad. The text points to a *specific* location within Stanley.



"
Hi xihi xiendlakalo lexi nga fambisaniki ni ku tlangeriwa ka swinkhubyana swa tempele?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku velekiwa ka xikwembu** (The worship of a deity).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Minkhuvo ya titempele to tala yi tlangeriwa tanihi xiphemu xa tempele xo hlanganisa malembe kumbe **ku tlangela siku ro velekiwa ra xikwembu** lexi rhangelaka kumbe xiendlakalo xihi ni xihi xin’wana lexikulu lexi fambisanaka ni tempele.""

This directly translates to: ""...Temple festivals are celebrated as a part of the temple to combine years or **to commemorate the worship day of a deity** that is honored or any other major event associated with the temple.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku tsariwa ka ndlopfu** (Birth of an elephant) - While elephants are present at the festivals, the passage doesn’t say the festival *commemorates* their birth.
*   **B: Ku hlanganisa lembe ka tempele** (Combining years at the temple) - This is mentioned as *a reason* for festivals, but not the main association.
*   **D: Swiendlakalonkulu leswi katsaka tempele** (Major events involving the temple) - This is too broad. The passage specifically mentions deity worship as a key reason.



"
Xana tindlopfu to sasekisiwa ti nga voniwa kwihi?,"The correct answer is **B: Etitempeleni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...minkhuvo ya tempele ya Kerala ya tsakisa swinene ku yi vona, ni **ntlawa wa tindlopfu leti khavisiweke ti ri karhi ti famba**, ntlawa wa vayimbeleri va orchestra va le tempeleni ni minkhuvo yin’wana.""  This directly translates to ""...the temple festivals of Kerala are very exciting to see, and **rows of decorated elephants are seen walking**, rows of temple orchestra singers and other festivals.""

Therefore, the decorated elephants are seen *at the temples*.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi yihi ndlela leyi tolovelekeke yo hlayisa mali ebindzwini kumbe eka hakelo ya xihahampfhuka ya xiyenge lexi nga durhiki?","The correct answer is **A: Ku yi tirhisa eka khampani ya wena** (Using it with your company).

Here's why, based on the provided text:

The passage explicitly states: ""...i ku kombela khamphani ya wena yi ku hakelela"" (…asking your company to book it for you).  It suggests that instead of directly booking the expensive/difficult route, you can have your company handle the booking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku buka eka xiyenge lexi durhiki ku tlula xa bindzu** (Booking the more difficult route than the bindzu) - The text suggests *avoiding* the difficult route if possible.
* **C: Ku buka xihahampfhuka lexi nga fambiki hi ku kongoma** (Booking a flight that travels by connecting) - The passage specifically says connecting flights are *not* recommended.
* **D: Ku kuma mintshovo ya mali** (Getting money discounts) - While the passage mentions companies pricing appropriately, it doesn’t say you’ll get a discount.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga vaka ku tlanga hi nkarhi ku xi secha loko u buka hi ntsengo wa swiyenge swin’wana?","The correct answer is **C: Mintshovo ya mali (Cost of money)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses the willingness of travelers to pay a premium (more money) to get a better seat (upper class or more comfortable). It talks about potentially double-paying for a preferred seat and how companies price accordingly, knowing people will pay for comfort and convenience.  Therefore, the core issue being discussed is the *value* and *cost* associated with different seating options – the cost of money in relation to getting a desired travel experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Swihahampfhuka leswi fambaka hi ku kongoma (Flights that travel by connecting):** While connecting flights are mentioned as an example, they aren't the central theme.
* **B: Xiyenge xa bindzu (Window seat):**  The passage speaks to more than just window seats – it’s about upper class vs. economy and general comfort.
* **D: Xiyenge xo durha (Aisle seat):** Similar to B, aisle seats are not the primary focus.



"
I yini lexi nga bohiki ku katsiwa loko u pimanisa ntsengo hinkwawo wo ya eAfrika swin’we ni ntsengo wa misava hinkwayo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ntsengo wa tivhisa leti engetelekeke ehandle ka le Afrika**.

Here's why:

The question asks what costs should be included when comparing the *total* cost of flying to Africa with the cost of visas. The text specifically mentions: ""U nga rivali ku katsa mali leyi engetelekeke ya tivhisa leti ngetelekeke..."" which translates to ""You should not exclude the additional cost of visas.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ntsengo wa swibalo swo suka eAfrika:** This refers to departure taxes *from* Africa, not costs *to* Africa.
*   **C: Ntsengo wa vhisa ya le Afrika:** The prompt focuses on visas needed *before* traveling to Africa, not internal visas within African countries.
*   **D: Ntsengo wa swofamba etindhawini leti nga ehandle ka Afrika:**  This refers to transportation to the airport, etc., which are not the primary comparison point when looking at overall flight costs.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini swilo swo hambanahambana leswi switolo swi sungulaka ku swi xavisa?","The correct answer is **A: Swakudya leswi se swi swekiweke** (Pre-cooked food).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Loko ku sweka swi nga koteki, swi boha munhu a xava swakudya leswi se swi swekiweke."" This directly translates to ""If it's not cooked, it encourages people to buy pre-cooked food.""  The passage is discussing how shops are starting to sell already prepared meals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Timakhrowevhi (Microwaves):** While some shops have microwaves, the passage says they *may* have them, it doesn't state it's the primary thing they are starting to sell.
* **C: Tirhesturente endzeni ka switolo (Restaurants inside shops):** The passage mentions restaurants can exist *within* shops, but says many are unaffordable, not that shops are *starting* to offer them.
* **D: Minxavo yo chipa (Cheap prices):** While price is implied as a factor, the passage focuses on the *type* of food being sold (pre-cooked), not just the price.



"
Hi xihi xitirhisiwa lexi kumekaka eswitolo lexi nga tshukaka xi tsakisa khasitama lexi xavaka swakudya leswi swekiweke?,"The correct answer is **A: Tirhesturente endzeni ka switolo** (Restaurant inside the store).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Eka matiko man'wana kumbe switolo swin'wana ku va ku ri na rhesturente yin'we endzeni ka swona, mikarhi yo tala yi va yi nga endleriwanga ku tshama u dyela kona naswona yi chipile.""  This directly translates to ""In some countries or stores, there is a restaurant inside it, often people don't bother to sit and eat there and it's cheap.""

The passage describes a situation where people can buy pre-cooked food, and a restaurant *within* the store is a place where you'd find that.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nhlawulo wa swilo switsongo (Discount on items):** While a store might have discounts, it doesn't explain the pre-cooked food.
* **C: Swakudya leswi nga swekiwangiki (Uncooked food):** The passage focuses on *cooked* food.
* **D: Makhrowevhi (Microwaves):**  Microwaves are mentioned as a way to *heat* food, but not the source of the pre-cooked food itself.

Eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi nga tshukaka xi nga twisisiwi hi vanhu va le Beligium ni va le Switzerland lava vulavulaka Xifurwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Endlelo ro tirhisa tinomboro leri tolovelekeke eFurwa** (The system of using numbers that is common in France).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the way numbers are said and written in Belgium and Switzerland differs *significantly* from the way they are in France.  While people in Belgium and Switzerland *understand* the French numbers, they were likely taught a different system in school and use that system primarily.  The other options are too broad or don't address the specific difference highlighted in the text.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi swihi leswi nga faniki eFurwa ni le Belgium kumbe Switzerland?,"The correct answer is **A: Mavitanelo ya marito hinkwawo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Xifurwa lexi vulavuriwaka eBelgium na Switzerland swi hambana kantsongo ni Xifurwa lexi vulavuriwaka eFurwa, hambiloko xi twisiseka ku fana.""  This translates to ""The French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland differs significantly from the French spoken in France, but it's still understandable.""  This means the *overall vocabulary* is similar enough to be understood, even with differences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Endlelo ro tirhisa tinomboro:** The passage specifically says the way numbers are said/written is *different* (""ndlela ya ku vitana mavito man’wana yi hambanile ka ntsongo"").
* **C: Xifurwa xa ntolovelo lexi dyondzisiwaka eswikolweni:** The passage states people in Belgium and Switzerland may *not* learn standard French in school, implying a difference in what's taught.
* **D: Ku peletiwa ka marito yo karhi ya Xifurwa:** The passage doesn't directly mention pronunciation similarities or differences.



"
Hi le ka xiyimo xihi laha u nga tshukaka u nga nyikiwi mali ya ku loveriwa?,"The correct answer is **B: Loko u ringeta ku buka ekhampanini ya xihahampfhuka hi ku kongoma ematshan’weni yo tirhisa muyimeri.**

Here's why:

The passage states you *must* book directly with the airline (by phone) to be eligible for reimbursement for expenses if your flight is significantly delayed.  Option B describes actively *avoiding* booking directly with the airline by using a representative/travel agent. Therefore, you would not be eligible for reimbursement in that situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** WestJet is listed as an airline that *does* offer reimbursement.
*   **C:** Lufthansa is listed as an airline that *does* offer reimbursement. The origin/destination doesn't change that.
*   **D:** Delta is listed as an airline that *does* offer reimbursement.



"
Hi wihi leswi nga ntiyiso hi tihakelo ta ku loveriwa?,"The correct answer is **D: Ti fanele ku bukiwa hi ku kongoma ekhampanini ya xihahampfhuka hi foni.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Eka swiyimo hikwaswo, u fanele u buka hi foyini eka khampani ya swihaha mpfhuka."" This directly translates to ""In some cases, you need to book by phone with the airline.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti hlanganisa ntsengo wa ku ya enkosini** - This refers to including the cost of going to the destination, but doesn't relate to *how* to book discounted fares.
* **B: Ti fanele ku bukiwa hi ku kongoma eka webusayiti ya xihahampfhuka xexo** - The passage specifically says to book by *phone* in certain situations, not the website.
* **C: Ti hlanganisa mitsengo ya ku famba hi timinete ta makumu** - This talks about the cost of long-haul flights, not the booking method.

Hi rini laha ku tirhisa xitirhisiwa xa GPS leyi tiyimeleke swi nga olovaka ku tlula ku tirhisa tiapp leti pfumelaka GPS?,"The correct answer is **A: Loko u ringeta ku hlayisa mali**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yi nga hlayisa mali ya wena ematshan’wini ya mimepe leyintshwa ya ti GPS,kumbe divayisi leyi yi tiyimeleke ya GPS kumbe ku renta yin’we ya tikhamphani leti rentisa hi timovha."" (It can save you money on new GPS maps, a dedicated GPS device, or renting one from a rental company.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Loko u tiyiseka leswaku u ta kota ku tirhisa data** - The passage actually states apps *won't* work well without data.
* **C: Loko u famba endhawini leyi nga le kule** - The passage doesn't mention anything about location affecting the usefulness of apps vs. dedicated devices.
* **D: Loko u nga swi lavi ku rentisa xitirhisiwa** - While true, the primary advantage given in the passage is *saving money*.



"
Hi xihi xivangelo lexi nga riki xinene xo tirhisa app leyi pfumelaka GPS ematshan’weni ya xitirhisiwa lexi tiyimeleke?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku hlayisa mali** (It saves money).

The text specifically states: ""Yi nga hlayisa mali ya wena ematshan’wini ya mimepe leyintshwa ya ti GPS, kumbe divayisi leyi yi tiyimeleke ya GPS kumbe ku renta yin’we ya tikhamphani leti rentisa hi timovha.""  This directly translates to ""It saves your money on buying new GPS maps, a dedicated GPS device, or renting one from rental companies.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku ka u nga lavi ku vilerisiwa hi ku tirhiseka ka data** (You might not want to be charged for data usage) - While the text *mentions* data usage being a limitation, it doesn't present it as a primary *reason* to use the app.
* **C: Ku papalata ku rentisa** (It's cheaper to rent) - The text says the app saves you money *compared to* renting, not that renting is cheap.
* **D: Ku ka u nga lavi ku xava mimepe leyintshwa** (You might not want to buy new maps) -  Again, this is a consequence of saving money, not the main reason *why* you'd use the app.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, u nga tiyisisa njhani leswaku u kume xikepe lexi faneleke?","The correct answer is **C: Ku buka hi ku tirhisa muyimeri loyi a tirhanaka ni ku famba hi Galapagos** (Booking through a representative who specializes in Galapagos travel).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes carefully choosing a Galapagos cruise.** It mentions the variety in ship sizes (8-100 passengers) and suggests finding one that suits your preferences.
* **A specialist representative (option C) would have the knowledge to match you with the right ship.** They understand the different options, itineraries, and what each ship offers.
* **Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:**
    * **A: Ku buka mi ri ntlawa wa vakhandziyi va 8+ lava rhandzaka swilo leswi fanaka** (Booking with a group of 8+ people with similar interests) - While potentially enjoyable, it doesn't *ensure* you get a suitable ship, just a compatible group.
    * **B: Ku buka hi nkarhi lowu nga durhiki ngopfu** (Booking well in advance) - While booking in advance is *helpful*, it doesn't guarantee the ship will be right for you.
    * **D: Ku buka ka ha ri ni nkarhi** (Booking at the last minute) - The passage suggests ships are often fully booked, making last-minute bookings risky and less likely to get you a preferred option.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi swihi leswi nga tirhisiwiki tanihi ndlela yo kucetela vaendzi ku hambeta va gembula?","The correct answer is **C: Swonwa swa mahala** (Free drinks).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Tikhasino ti ni swakudya, swonwa ni vuhungasi byo hlawuleka leswaku byi nyanyula vapfhumba ku endlela leswaku va nga fambi."" (Casinos have food, drinks and amenities to entice gamblers to keep playing). This directly links free drinks to encouraging gambling.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku tirhisa swinene ku vonakala ka ntumbuluko** (Using the appearance of luxury intensely) - While casinos *are* luxurious, the passage doesn't specifically mention this as a tactic to keep people gambling.
* **B: Ku nyika swilo swo tanihi mathikithi ya mahala ya tikhonsati** (Giving things like free concert tickets) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Ku tshika ku vekela tiwachi** (Not installing clocks) - The passage *does* mention not having clocks (""Hakanyingi a ku na mafasitere ni tiwachi...""), but it frames this as a way to disorient people, not a primary method of encouraging gambling. The drinks are a more direct incentive.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, mugemburi loyi a tlhariheke u fanele ku papalata yini?","The correct answer is **A: Ku nwa byalwa byo tala** (Drinking too much alcohol).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that casinos provide food, drink, and accommodation *for free* to encourage gamblers to stay and spend money. It also implies this can lead to problems (""ku dakwa swi endla leswaku munhu a nga ehleketi kahle"" - gambling can make a person not think clearly).  The passage then stresses the importance of looking after vulnerable people.

Therefore, offering excessive free alcohol is a key tactic casinos use that could harm a vulnerable gambler, making it the most relevant thing a responsible person should discourage.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Ku amukela swo n’wi kucetela ku hambeta a tlanga** (Accepting gifts to try and make them stay) - While casinos offer things, the core issue being highlighted is the *excess* and potential harm, not just accepting hospitality.
* **C: Ku kamba swokombankarhi kumbe tiwachi** (Talking about secrets or watches) - This is unrelated to the passage's focus on gambling and vulnerability.
* **D: Ku vutisa nyangwa wo huma lowu nga ekusuhi** (Asking about a nearby source of money) - This is a possible consequence of gambling addiction, but the passage is about the *casino's* actions, not the gambler's.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xiyenge xa mbulavulo lexi tsariwaka hi letere lerikulu exikarhi ka xivulwa?","The correct answer is **A: Maendli**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Naswona ku nga vuriwa leswaku yi endla ku hlaya ku olova, hambiloko yi endla ku tsala ku tika hikuva u fanele u languta leswaku **xiendli** kumbe **rihlawuri** ri tirhisiwe hi ndlela leyi faneleke.""  The question asks for the word capitalized within the sentence.  ""Maendli"" is the capitalized word.

While ""Rihlawuri"" is also mentioned, it's not capitalized in the passage.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga endlaka swi nonon’hwa loko riviti ri tsariwe hi letere lerikulu?","The correct answer is **A: Ku hlaya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Naswona ku nga vuriwa leswaku yi endla ku hlaya ku olova..."" (And it cannot be said that it causes confusion, but...). This directly links using a capital letter to *causing confusion* (ku hlaya). The passage contrasts this with making things clear (ku tsala ku tika).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ku hambanisa exikarhi ka maendli** - While the passage mentions comparing actions, it doesn't link this to capitalization.
*   **C: Ku tsala** - Capitalization is contrasted *with* clarity, not directly linked to creating it.
*   **D: Ku hambanisa exikarhi ka swilo** - This is too broad and isn't specifically discussed in relation to capitalization.



"
"Emalayinini ya le Malaysia, hi xihi xikoweto lexi vulaka “tanani”?","The correct answer is **A: Ku khotsa ritiho ra ku komba**.

Here's why:

The passage states that in Malaysia, especially among Malays, ""tanani"" is used to express gratitude or politeness, similar to a ritual of showing respect - like tipping in other Western countries.  This directly aligns with ""ku khotsa ritiho ra ku komba"" (to perform a ritual of showing respect).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku tlakusa voko:** While the passage *starts* by mentioning raising a voice, it quickly moves on to explain that ""tanani"" is different and more nuanced.
* **C: Ku phakatana:** This means ""to reconcile"" or ""to come together"" and isn't related to the meaning of ""tanani"" as described.
* **D: Ku tlakusa khudzu:** This means ""to raise your head"" and is not relevant to the passage's explanation.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xikoweto lexi nga ha vulaka “vuya”?","The correct answer is **B: Ku khotsa ritiho ra ku komba**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses how different cultures interpret gestures. It specifically mentions that in Malaysia, a gesture similar to showing the sole of your foot is considered extremely rude, comparable to being insulted.  The passage then draws a parallel to a British traveler in Spain being offended by someone pointing at them.

Therefore, ""vuya"" (insult) in this context refers to the act of **offending someone with a gesture**, or **provoking a negative reaction through a ritualistic display** (like showing the sole of your foot or pointing rudely).  ""Ku khotsa ritiho ra ku komba"" (provoking a gesture) best captures this meaning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku tlakusa xandla xi langute endzeni** (Raising a hand to the chin) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Ku tlakusa xandla xi langute ehandle** (Raising a hand outwards) - While raising a hand can be a gesture, the passage focuses on *specific* offensive gestures.
* **D: Ku kumeta nhloko** (Shaking the head) - This is a common gesture of disagreement, but not directly related to the concept of causing offense described in the text.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi vangelaka ku pandzeka?","The correct answer is **A: Mabuloho ya gamboko**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""...leyi yi tumbetiwaka hi **mabuloho ya gamboko**."" ( ...which is surrounded by **stone walls**.) and that these walls contribute to the flooding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nhulu ya gamboko leyi nga tiyangiki** - The text doesn't mention an unyielding rock.
* **C: Mabakwa lama nga na gwitsi lama waka** - While the text mentions broken bricks, it doesn't say they *cause* the flooding, only that they contribute to it along with the walls.
* **D: Tibuloko leti tshovekaka** - These are a result of the flooding (the blocks move) not the cause.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi i yini lexi nga tumbetiwaka hi mabuloho ya gamboko?","The correct answer is **A: Ku pandzeka** (Collapse/Subsidence).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...leswi swi ta vangela ku pandzeka, ku pfuleka swinene ka ndhawu leyi pandzekeke, leyi yi tumbetiwaka hi mabuloho ya gamboko.""  This directly translates to ""...this will cause collapse, severe sinking of the collapsed area, which is marked by cracks in the walls.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mabakwa lama nga na gwitsi** (Houses with cracks) - These *result* from the collapse, they aren't what's marked by the cracks.
* **C: Marhangu** (Footprints) - This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **D: Tibuloko letikulu** (Large blocks) - These are a *feature* of the collapse, not what marks the area.

This means any travel *outside* of Goma needs to be carefully considered due to potential conflict in the surrounding region.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vholkheno ya Nyiragongo:** While the volcano is mentioned, the text doesn't say travelers need to be aware of it specifically, but that Goma is used to monitor it.
*   **C: Entsindza wa doroba:** The text focuses on travel *outside* of the city, not within it.
*   **D: Rwanda:** Rwanda is mentioned as being near Goma, but the warning is specifically about the area around Goma itself, within the DRC.

Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki xitsundzuxo lexinene eka vapfhumba vo ya eGoma?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku lwa loku nga kona le North Kivu ka nyanyula** (The ongoing conflict in North Kivu is a concern).

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Doroba ri tlhela ri tirhisiwa tanihi ndhawu yo khandziya vholkheno ya Nyiragongo swinwe ni Tintshava leti Timfenhe ti fambaka eka tona eAfrika."" and ""Hi 2002 Goma yi hlaseriwe hi mukapu wa vholkheno ya Nyiragongo...Hambileswi Goma yi hlayisekeke, maendzo hinkwawo lama endliwaka eka ndhawu leyi yinga le handle ka Goma ya fanele ya lavisisiwa leswaku u ta tiva xiyimo xa tinyimpi leti ti nga kona eN’walungu wa xifundzha nkulu xa Kivu."" This highlights the constant threat of volcanic activity *and* the ongoing conflict in the region, making it the biggest concern for visitors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I ndhawu leyinene ya ya ku Landzelerisisa Timfenhe ta le Ntshaveni leyi nga durhiki** (It is a significant area to study the volcanoes and rare wildlife) - While true, the passage doesn't present this as a *concern* for visitors, but as a feature of the area.
* **C: Tithekisi ta swithuthuthu i ndlela leyinene yo rhendzelaka hayona** (Motorcycle taxis are the most common way to get around) - This is a practical detail about getting around, not a major concern.
* **D: Ntsindza wa vholkheno ya Nyiragongo wu le dorobeni** (The danger of the Nyiragongo volcano is in the city) - The passage mentions the volcano's danger, but focuses on the broader region and the need to be aware of conflicts.



"
Xana mpfumelelo wo dzima tendze emalayinini wa siku ro sungula ra August wu ta kumeka rini?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti-1 ta January**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hikwalaho, loko u lava mpfumelelo wa malayini lama ya nga talangiki vanhu hi May wu kumeka hi 1 Jan.""  This means permits for May are available starting January 1st. Since August is after May, the permits would *also* be available by January 1st.

The text clearly states that permits become available for dates in the future, starting with January 1st for May, and continuing in a similar fashion for later months.



"
Hi yihi pholisi leyi endleriweke ku sirhelela canyon?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku tirha endlelo ro nyika mpfumelelo ka loyi a rhangaka a kombela** (It works on a first-come, first-served basis for permits).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mpfumelelo lowu wu vekeriweke vanhu lava fikaka wu pimiwile, naswona wu kumeka hikuya hi leswaku hi wihi a nga sungula ku fika.""  This directly translates to ""The permit is issued to people on a first-come, first-served basis, and is available until all are taken.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mimpfumelelo yi kumeka hi ti-1 January ntsena** (Permits are available from January 1st) - While January 1st is *when* some permits become available, it doesn't describe the *policy* for getting them.
* **C: Mimpfumelelo yi nga kumeka hi ku endla swikombelo hi xiviri** (Permits are available by making an application in advance) - The passage says they are *highly competitive* and fill up quickly, implying advance application doesn't guarantee success.
* **D: Ku ni mimpfumelelo ya nhlayo leyi pimiweke** (There are a limited number of permits) - This is true, but it doesn't describe the *policy* of how they are distributed.  It's a fact *about* the system, not the system itself.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga tshukaka xi nga kumeka eka tihotela lexi hlamuseriweke eka xiyenge lexi?,"The correct answer is **D: Makamara lama ha ku lunghisiwaka hi ndlela ya manguva lawa** (Rooms that haven't been modernized in a long time).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...hakanyingi a va dya swakudya swo lalela swa kahle ni ku tihungasa nivusiku."" (they often didn't eat good food and slept badly at night) and ""...nhundzu ya khale, ku pfumaleka ka tindhawu ta manguva lawa to tihungasa ni swilo swo karhi swa khale..."" (in the past, the deterioration of old places meant sleeping with old things). This strongly suggests the hotels were not updated or modernized, meaning the rooms were old and likely uncomfortable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tindhawu to nwa byalwa byo hlawuleka (Affordable drinking areas):** The passage doesn't mention bars or affordable drinks.
* **B: Rhesturente yo hlawuleka endzeni ka muako (Affordable restaurant near the door):** The passage states the food was *not* good, so an affordable restaurant wouldn't be a defining characteristic.
* **C: Vapfhumba kuloni lava dumeke kumbe lava tivekaka (Visible/distinguished colonial officials):** While the passage mentions officials and chiefs, it doesn’t indicate they were *specifically* visible or a feature of the hotels.



"
"Hi ku landza rungula leri nga eka xiyenge lexi, eka swilo leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi vaendzi va le hotela va nga taka va nga xi rhangisi emahlweni?","The correct answer is **C: Ndhawu yo tihungasa ni vusiku** (A place for entertainment at night).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...hakanyingi a va dya swakudya swo lalela swa kahle ni ku tihungasa nivusiku."" (…they often ate delicious food and had entertainment at night).  This directly indicates that entertainment was a feature of these hotels.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku va ni fanichara ya xikhale eka muako hinkwawo** (To have antique furniture everywhere) - The passage doesn't mention furniture specifically. It focuses on the overall ambiance and clientele.
* **B: Rhesturente leyi nga ni musweki wo hlawuleka** (A restaurant with an affordable price) - The passage suggests the hotels catered to the wealthy, meaning affordability wasn’t a priority.
* **D: Makamara ya mitsengo leyi nga durhiki** (Inexpensive rooms) - Again, the passage indicates the hotels were for the wealthy, so inexpensive rooms are unlikely.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi faneleke ku papalatiwa hi vapfhumba lava endzelaka Greenland?","The correct answer is **D: Ku vitana muaki wa le Greenland u ku “Eskimo”**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hilaha swi kombisiweke laha henhla, hambi leswi rito “Eskimo” ri pfumeleriwaka eUnited States, ri tekiwa ri nga amukeleki eka vanhu vale Arctic, ngopfu ngopfu eKhanada... vahlapfa va fanele va papalata ku tirhisa rito leri.""  This directly translates to needing to be careful *not* to use the term ""Eskimo"" when referring to people from Greenland.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tindhawu tin’wana leti dumeke hi vugevenga byo tala:** While the passage mentions a lack of crime, it doesn't state this needs to be carefully considered by visitors.
*   **B: Ku ta ni swiambalo swo kufumela, hikuva maxelo hakanyingi ma hisa lembe hinkwaro:** The passage mentions needing a lot of supplies, but doesn't frame it as something visitors *must* be careful about; it's more a logistical consideration.
*   **C: Ku langutela ku tirha loko u ri kwale, hikuva inthanete yi pfa yi nga tirhi kahle:** The passage states"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga tshukaka xi va xiphiqo eka vapfhumba lava nga swi lunghekelangiki ku endzela Greenland?","The correct answer is **C: Maxelo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Maxelo xo titimela kumbexana hi wona khombo leri munhu a nga hlanganaka na rona loko a nga ma lunghekelangiki."" This directly translates to ""Customs can be a problem for people who are not prepared to travel to Greenland."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tinsuna ta ndhawu yoleyo (Local customs):** While the text *mentions* local customs, it doesn't frame them as a problem for unprepared travelers.
* **B: Vugevenga (Immigration):** The text specifically states immigration isn't an issue in Greenland.
* **D: Vaakatiko (Tourists):** The text doesn't highlight tourists as being particularly problematic, but rather the *requirements* for travel.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi sweswi xi tirhisiwaka tanihi plaza?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The text states: ""Sweswi wu tirha tanihi plaza..."" referring to Jardín de la Unión. This means it is currently used as a plaza.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: The Alley of the Kiss (Callejon del Beso):** This is described as a narrow space between two buildings, not a plaza.
* **C: Templo de San Diego:** This is a temple, located *near* the plaza, but not the plaza itself.
* **D: Callejon del Beso:** Same as B, it's an alley, not a plaza.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga kumekiki le Jardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **D: Muako wa khale wa vukhongeri**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Jardín de la Unión...a yi akiwe leswaku yi va ntsindza wa vanhu va vukhongeri hi va 17th-century, sweswi muako lowu nga sala i Templo de San Diego."" This directly translates to ""Jardín de la Unión...was built as a place of worship by the 17th-century, next to the remaining structure of the Temple of San Diego.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gazebo leyikulu leyi nga ni switirhisiwa** - While a gazebo is mentioned, it's not the defining historical feature.
*   **B: Kaya ha xitirho xa khale lexi rhandziwaka** - The text mentions a ""kaya ra munhu wa khale"" (old house) in relation to Callejon del Beso, *not* the Jardín de la Unión itself.
*   **C: Tirhesiturente lexi rhendzeleke ntanga** - Restaurants are present, but they're a modern addition, not the original historical purpose.



"
"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga tekiwaka xi nga pakanisi malunghana ni ku hayika ninhlikanhi?","The correct answer is **A: Ku laveka ku tilunghiselela kutsongo eku hayikeni ka ninhlikanhi eka tindlela to olova.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ku hayika ninhlikani swikatsa ku famba riendzo leri nga le hansi ka khilomitara kumbe ro leha leri nga hetiwaka hi siku."" This translates to ""Hiking with children allows for journeys of less than a kilometer or those that can be completed within a day.""  This directly supports the idea of *planning appropriately* for children's hikes – keeping them short and manageable.  ""Tindlela to olova"" means suitable paths/routes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mimpfhuka ya siyana, kambe yi endleriwe ku hlanganisiwa hi siku:** (Different animals, but organized to be seen daily) - The passage doesn’t mention anything about animals.
* **C: Vanhu lava hanyeke kahle hi ntolovelo va swi kota ku tiphina hi sweswo:** (People who are well prepared can manage it) – While true in general, this isn’t the *specific* point made about hiking *with children*.
* **D: Ku hayika ninhlikanhi a hi xiendlo lexi faneleke eka mindyangu leyi nga ni swihlangi:** (Hiking with children is not a suitable activity for families with babies) - The passage suggests it *can* be done with careful planning, but acknowledges challenges for very young children or those in early school.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana hi rini laha siku ro hayika ri lavaka ku lunghiselela loku nga nyawuriki?","The correct answer is **A: Loko loyi a hayikaka a tiyerile emirini** (When the hiker is tired in the afternoons).

Here's why:

The passage states that hikes should be planned so people can comfortably walk distances of a kilometer or less per day. It also mentions concerns about people with young children or lower-grade students.  Being tired in the afternoons suggests the hike is too long or strenuous, making it difficult to complete comfortably, and therefore needing to be planned differently.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Loko ku tirhisiwa ndlela yo olova** (When a difficult path is used) - While a difficult path contributes to strenuousness, the passage focuses on *daily distance* and comfort.
* **C: Loko vana va nghenela ku hayika** (When children participate in the hike) - The passage acknowledges needing to consider children, but doesn't state this *causes* the need for careful planning – it’s a factor *to be considered* during planning.
* **D: Loko ku hayikiwa endhawini ya ntumbuluko swinene** (When hiking in a mountainous area) - Similar to B, mountainous terrain adds difficulty, but the core issue raised is about manageable daily distances.



"
I yini lexi hambaneke hi tindhawu leti tlakukeke le Rogaland kumbe Agder loko ti pimanisiwa na Norway hinkwayo?,"The correct answer is **D: Hakanyingi ti funengetiwe hi heathera**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ERogaland na eAgder ti tiviwa tanihi """"hei"""" leyi vulaka misava leyi yi nga riki na misinya leyi toloveleke ku funengetiwa hi heathera ehenhla."" (Rogaland and Agder are called ""hei"" which refers to heathlands that lack forests and are covered with heather.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti ni misinya:** The passage specifically says Rogaland and Agder *lack* forests.
* **B: Ku hava tifjord:** The passage discusses *both* fjord areas and heathlands, but doesn't state Agder and Rogaland lack fjords altogether.  It contrasts them with the fjord regions.
* **C: Tindhawu leti tlakukeke hakanyingi a ti tlhandluki ngopfu:** The passage *does* highlight a key difference – the type of landscape (heathland vs. fjord/mountainous).



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga kumekiki le Norway?","The correct answer is **A: Rivala leri pfulekeke swinene**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...leyi fanaka na rivala."" and ""...Mavala lama tlakukeke lama tolovelekeke ku vuriwa tanihi """"vidde"""" leswi vulaka ndawu leyi anameke, yi pfulekeke leyi yi nga na minsinya...""  This directly describes a very flat, open landscape similar to a plain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tindhawu leti nga ni mahlathi:** The passage specifically mentions areas *without* trees (""le yi nga na minsinya"").
* **C: Tifjord to voyama swinene:** While the passage mentions *tifjord* (fjords), it doesn't describe them as particularly mountainous. It focuses on the flat coastal areas.
* **D: Tindhawu to pfumala misinya:**  The passage specifically contrasts the areas described (""vidde"") with those that *have* vegetation (""le yi nga bihiwangiki,"" meaning not cultivated/growing).



"
Xana hi rini laha vapfhumba lava tsakela ku rheta eka gamboko va faneleke ku endzela switsunga?,"The correct answer is **A: Hi xixika**.

Here's why:

The passage states that discrepancies exist *within* the lunar calendar, causing difficulties in determining the correct time for pilgrims to circumambulate (rheta eka gamboko).  ""Hi xixika"" (in detail/specifically) refers to needing to examine these discrepancies closely to find the accurate timing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hi nkarhi lowu teleke vapfhumba:** This doesn't address the *timing* issue, just that pilgrims exist.
* **C: Hi nkarhi wa ximumu xa le India:** While the passage mentions the Indian monsoon, it's about the *difficulty* of aligning the pilgrimage with the lunar calendar, not just performing it during monsoon season.
* **D: Hi ximun’wana:** This is too vague and doesn't relate to the passage's content.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi rihi laha hakanyingi ku vaka ni vapfhumba vo tala eswitsungeni?","The correct answer is **C: Hi nkarhi wa ximumu xa le India**.

Here's why:

The passage states the spider's web is *most* noticeable during the Indian monsoon season.  It directly links the best time to see many spiders to that period.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hi nkarhi wa gamboko yo tala:** While the passage mentions webs being plentiful, it doesn't say *when* they are most plentiful, just that they exist.
* **B: Eka nguva hinkwayo ya ku rheta egambokweni:** This refers to the time webs *remain* visible, not when spiders are most active building them.
* **D: Eka tin’hweti hinkwato ta xixika:**  ""Xixika"" refers to the rainy season, but the passage specifically points to the Indian monsoon as the key time.



"
I yini lexi u faneleke ku xi papalata loko u lava ku kuma xikepe laha ku lavekaka munhu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku yingayinga ni swikepe leswi yimeke** (Negotiating with available ships).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""U ta kuna van’wana lava hayikaka swikepe naswona va ta avelana vuxokoxoko bya vona na wena."" (You will meet others who have ships and they will share their information with you.) and ""...u ta va u veka switiviso hi mpfuno wa wena, u lunghisa ndhawu yo layicha no chicha swikepe eka yona..."" (you will place conditions according to your need, arrange a place to load and unload cargo from it...).  This directly implies *negotiating* to secure a spot on a ship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku titoloveta vakaputeni va swikepe** (Appealing to ship captains) - While you might interact with captains, the passage doesn't focus on *appealing* to them, but rather on finding available options.
* **C: Ku navetisa hi vukorhokeri bya wena** (Advertising your skills) - The passage focuses on securing transport, not on offering services.
* **D: Ku honisa vahayiki van’wana va le swikepeni** (Praising other passengers) -  This isn't relevant to getting a space on a ship.



"
I yini lexi u faneleke ku xi endla etindhawini to yima swikepe loko u lava xikepe lexi lavaka mpfuno?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku tshinelela vanhu ntsena loko va basisa swikepe swa vona**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**u tshinelela vanhu u basisa swikepe swa vona**"" (you patiently listen to people as they describe their needs). This directly relates to finding a suitable ship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku tihlanganisa ni vatlutisi (Meeting with researchers):**  The passage mentions meeting ship captains, not researchers.
* **B: Ku miyela (Being quiet):** The passage emphasizes *communication* and *listening* to people's needs, not being quiet.
* **D: Ku papalata vahayiki van’wana va le swikepeni (Complaining to other passengers on the ship):** The passage focuses on finding the right ship, not complaining once you're on one.



"
Hi yihi ndhawu leyi nga tsakeriwaka hi mupfhumba loyi a lavaka ku tiva hi matimu ya xihlala hi nkarhi wa vakoloni?,"The correct answer is **B: Waterfront ya le Kowloon**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Leswaku u vona tindhawu leti sasekeke ngopfu eHong Kong, siya xihlala u ya eka ndhawu leyi languteneke na waterfront yale Kowloon."" (To see the most historic areas of Hong Kong, one usually goes to the area adjacent to the Kowloon waterfront.)  It also mentions the colonial history is visible starting there.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ribuwu ra le N’walungwini:** While the passage mentions the influence of the West, it doesn't specifically say the history is *found* in the Western District.
*   **C: Edorobeni ra Hong Kong:** This is too broad. The passage points to a specific area.
*   **D: EVictoria Harbor:**  Victoria Harbor is a *feature* of the landscape, not a specific historical area to explore.



"
Hi yihi ndhawu leyi nga tsakeriwaka hi mupfhumba loyi a rhangisaka emahlweni ku vona ku saseka ka ndhawu?,"The correct answer is **A: Victoria Harbor**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...miako leyi endlaka Hong Kong skyline yi fanisiwa na ba chati leyi vangamaka hikwalaho ka mati lama kumekaka eVictoria Harbour."" This directly links the beautiful views and skyline to Victoria Harbour.  The question asks about a place a visitor would go to *see* the stunning scenery, and the text points to Victoria Harbour.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hong Kong hi xiviri** - The text doesn't focus on viewing Hong Kong from a distance.
*   **C: Xihlala xa Hong Kong** - While the whole city is beautiful, the passage specifically highlights the harbor views.
*   **D: Waterfront ya le Kowloon** - While mentioned as a good place to see parts of Hong Kong, it's the view *of* Victoria Harbor from there that's emphasized.



"
Xana tisala tin’wana ti na yini leswi pfunaka ku hunguta khombo ro va nenge wu phasiwa hi swo khwakanyisa?,"The correct answer is **B: Swisirhelelo (Safety/Protection)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses measures to *prevent* artists from being seriously injured when equipment falls on them. It mentions rules to follow and even examples of safety features in some (especially English) equipment.  The whole point is about reducing the *risk* of injury – that's what ""swisirhelelo"" (safety/protection) covers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tisoli to lala (Sleeping pills):** This is completely irrelevant to the passage.
*   **C: Swikhwakanyiso swa dzovo (Egg mixtures):** Also irrelevant.
*   **D: Ku tshamiseka kahle (Good movement/agility):** While being agile might help *react* to a falling object, it doesn't *prevent* the object from falling or lessen the impact. The passage focuses on preventative measures – the equipment and rules – not the artist's reflexes.



"
Hi xihi xiyenge xa butsu yo gada lexi pfunaka ku antswisa vuhlayiseki bya mugadi loko a tirhisa swikhwakanyiso?,"The correct answer is **C: Xirhendze**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically mentions:** ""Vakhandziyi vo tala va rhanga hi ku mbala tintanghu leti nga xitiga ni **xirhendze** lexi nga olova xithlela xi tontswa.""  This translates to ""Many artists sculpt using various tools including a **chisel** which is often made of steel and sharpened."" A chisel is a key tool for shaping and detailing sculptures, directly contributing to the artist's ability to create and refine their work.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tisoli to tsindzihela, to lala:** This refers to foundations and laying, related to building, not sculpting.
* **B: Dzovo:** This means pots, and is unrelated to sculpting tools.
* **D: Soli yo anama:** This means soft soil, a material *used* in sculpting but not a tool itself.



"
I yini leswi nyikiwaka vapfhumba hi fambiselo ra tindhawu to amukela?,"The correct answer is **A: Byetlelo eka vaaki va madoroba lava rhurhelaka vapfhumba** (Hospitality from city dwellers to travelers).

Here's why:

The passage states that the local hospitality initiatives connect travelers with city residents who offer accommodation. This is the core function described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Swihahampfhuka swo chipa** (Cheap adventures) - While it *can* be cheap, the passage focuses on the hospitality aspect, not primarily the cost.
* **C: Vuvalangi lebyi hleriwaka hi vaaki va madoroba** (Tourism promoted by city dwellers) - It's about offering accommodation, not just promoting tourism.
* **D: Ku tihlanganisa ni vapfhumba van’wana lava endzelaka ndhawu leyi fanaka** (Meeting other travelers looking for similar places) -  While travelers *might* meet each other, the passage doesn't emphasize this as a primary benefit.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi lexi nga riki ntiyiso eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka malunghana ni fambiselo ra tindhawu to amukela?","The correct answer is **B: Mafambiselo man’wana ma nga ha lava ku tiyisisa vapfhumba hilaha ku engetelekeke**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""…mafambiselo man’wana ma nyikela kumbe ma lavaka tindlela leti engetelekeke to tiyisisa."" This directly translates to ""some trips offer or seek ways to verify.""  This means not all trips offer verification, but *some* do.

Let’s look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The text says hosts *receive* requests, not that all travelers are given privileges.
* **C:** The text mentions reviews *of* hosts, not hosts receiving information *about* travelers.
* **D:** The text doesn't suggest hosts are found *through* travelers, but rather travelers find hosts.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mupfhumba wa muxaka muni loyi a nga tshukaka a kumeka eka ekamareni ra le hositela ra nhlanganelo?","The correct answer is **A: Muendzi loyi a nga kwalomu ka malembe ya makumembirhi** (A visitor who is under eighteen years old).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tihositela ti rhurhela ngopfu vantshwa – vaendzi lava nga emalembeni ya kwalomu makume mambirhi..."" (Hospitals strongly discourage young people – visitors under eighteen years old...).  This directly identifies the age group being discussed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Muendzi loyi a fambaka a ri yexe** (A visitor who is walking alone) - The passage doesn't mention anything about visitors being alone.
* **C: Muendzi loyi a fambaka ni vana lavatsongo** (A visitor who is accompanied by young children) - While the passage mentions it's not ideal to see children, it doesn't specifically say *they* are the problematic group.
* **D: Muendzi loyi a nga exikarhi ka malembe ya makumenharhu** (A visitor who is between forty and fifty years old) -  This age group isn't mentioned in the text.



"
"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi a nga tshukaka a tshama ehositela?","The correct answer is **B: Vantshwa va malembe ya 22 lava fambaka swin’we**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tihositela ti rhurhela ngopfu vantshwa – vaendzi lava nga emalembeni ya kwalomu makume mambirhi..."" which translates to ""Hotels prefer young people - visitors around 22 years old...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vatekani lava fambaka ni ricece (Old people traveling with luggage):** The text specifically mentions *young* people.
* **C: Vatekani lava nga emalembeni ya va-70 (Old people in their 70s):**  Again, the text focuses on youth.
* **D: Mindyangu yimbirhi lexi fambaka ni vana va yona (A couple traveling with their children):** While the text mentions it's not ideal to see couples with children, it *doesn't* say they are the preferred guests.  It states some hotels allow them, but prefer the younger crowd.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma ku hoxa ximhandzana lexi vatliweke lexi vitaniwaka Boomerang?","The correct answer is **A: Nkarhi hinkwawo xi tlhelela evokweni ra wena loko u xi hoxe kahle** (It always returns to you when you throw it correctly).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Loko u lava ku hoxa Boomerang leswaku yi tlhela yi vuya evokweni ra wena tirhisa leyi endliweke kahle."" (If you want to throw a Boomerang so that it always returns to you, use a well-made one.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage doesn't mention popularity with locals vs. visitors.
* **C:** The passage specifically says good boomerangs come from Australia: ""Kahlekahle tiBoomerang to tala ta le Australia..."" (Especially good boomerangs come from Australia...)
* **D:** The passage implies *most* boomerangs return if thrown correctly, not that some don't.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi tirhisiwaka swinene eka swakudya swa le Javanese?,"The correct answer is **C: Chukele ra khokhonati**.

The passage specifically states: ""...ngopfungopfu chukele ra maJavanese ra khokhonati..."" which translates to ""...especially Javanese brown sugar..."". This indicates brown sugar (khokhonati) is used most frequently in Javanese cuisine.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana vuvabyi lebyi tlulelaka byi hangalaka njhani?","The correct answer is **B: Tipathojini**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ntungu lowu tlulelaka wu vangiwa hi **pathojini**, leyi fanaka na vharasi, bakhtheriya, nkurhe kumbe switsotswana leswi lumaka swin’wana.""  This directly translates to ""The infectious agent is caused by **pathogens**, which are similar to viruses, bacteria, fungi or other microorganisms.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vanhu lava tluletiweke (People who are infected)** - This describes *who* gets the illness, not *what* causes it.
* **C: Bakhtheriya (Bacteria)** - Bacteria are *a type* of pathogen, but the passage says the infectious agent *is* a pathogen, and could be many things *including* bacteria.
* **D: Ku tlhava nsawutiso (Getting tested)** - This is a preventative measure, not the cause of the infection.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi hikuya hi vutivi xi nga vangeliki vuvabyi lebyi tlulelaka?","The correct answer is **A: Ku tlhava nsawutiso** (To get vaccinated).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mifumo ya matiko yo tala yi lava leswaku vanhu lava endzaka, kumbe lava endzelaka matiko man’wana va tlhava nsawutiso wa mavabyi yo hambanahambana.""  This translates to ""Many countries require people who are leaving or entering other countries to get vaccinated against different diseases.""

The passage explains that vaccination is a way to prevent getting the infectious disease caused by the pathogen. The other options (viruses, bacteria, parasites) *cause* the disease, they aren't the preventative measure.

Xana hi le ka xiyimo xihi laha ku hlawula purokizi ta web ematshan’weni ya vanyiketi va ti VPN ya munhu swi nga ringanelaka mutirhisi?,"The correct answer is **A: Mutirhisi u lava ku fambisa hinkwako ku kwetlembetana ka inthanete** (The user wants to route all internet traffic).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ti fambisa hinkwako ku kwentlembana ka intanethe, ku nga ri http ntsena."" This translates to ""They route all internet traffic, not just http.""  This is the core function of a VPN as described in the text – to channel *all* connection through a secure tunnel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mutirhisi u vilerisiwa hi ku siveriwa hi nawu ni kumisisa rungula leri tumbetiweke** (The user is worried about being monitored by law and accessing blocked content) - While the passage *mentions* these as uses for a VPN, it doesn't say this is the primary reason someone would *need* to use one in this specific scenario regarding web proxies.
* **C: Mutirhisi ngopfungopfu u fambisa ku kwetlembetana ka inthanete** (The user casually routes internet traffic) - The passage implies a more deliberate and focused use, not a casual one.
* **D: Mutirhisi u lava bandwith ya xiyimo xa le xikarhi ku ya ehenhla** (The user wants bandwidth of medium to high quality) - While a good VPN needs bandwidth, the passage doesn't state this as the reason for using a web proxy within the VPN.  It focuses on *how* the traffic is routed.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki ntiyiso hi ti-VPN ni ti purokizi ta web","The correct answer is **B: Tipurokizi ta web a ti koti ku fambisa nkwetlembetano hinkwawo ta inthanete.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ti fambisa hinkwako ku kwentlembana ka intanethe, ku nga ri http ntsena."" (They transmit all internet communication, not just http.) This directly contradicts option B.
* **The passage also mentions:** VPNs are used to bypass political censorship and access blocked websites. This implies they *do* handle all internet traffic.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A:** The passage doesn't compare bandwidth between VPNs and proxies.
    * **C:** The passage implies VPNs are *better* at security and bypassing restrictions (more reliable), therefore proxies wouldn't have a lower security profile.
    * **D:** The passage states both VPNs and proxies can transmit data other than just HTTP.

I yini lexi pfumelelaka munhu ku tirhisa foyini ya khamphani ehandle ka ndhawu leyi a tshamaka eka yona?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku foyina hi ku tirhisa inthanete** (Calling using the internet).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Tanihi leswi ku foyiniwaka hi Inthaneti, a ku laveki leswaku u tirhisa foyini ya khamphani leyi kumekaka eka ndhawu leyi u tshamaka eka yona kumbe u yi vhakelaka.""  This translates to ""Calling using the internet allows you to use a company's line that is located in an area you are not in or connected to.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tinomboro ta foyini ta misava** (Phone numbers of countries) - The passage discusses how numbers *appear* to be from different locations, but doesn't say these are what *allow* calling.
* **C: Tisethalayiti** (Satellites) - While satellites are mentioned as a location for internet access, they aren't the *enabling factor* for using a company's line remotely.
* **D: Tifoyini ta PSTN** (PSTN lines) - The passage contrasts using internet calling *instead* of traditional PSTN lines.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga lavaka ku endliwa leswaku u amukela tifoyini tin’wana?","The correct answer is **A: Ku xava nomboro ya misava (Get a local number)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that you *don't* need to have a number from the area you're physically located in. It then gives the example of someone in Alaska getting an Arizona number, and emphasizes needing a number ""that is recognized as being from Arizona.""  This directly implies getting a number from the desired location is the solution to receiving calls properly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku tirhisa khamphani ya tifoyini ta laha u tshamaka kona (Use a phone company from where you are located)** - The passage actually suggests *not* being limited by your current location's phone company.
* **C: Ku kuma nomboro ya le mugangeni wa ka n’wina (Get a border number)** - This isn’t mentioned in the passage and doesn't address the problem.
* **D: Ku xava foyini ya PSTN (Get a PSTN phone line)** - While PSTN lines are mentioned as the standard for phone numbers, the passage is about *how* to get a number that appears to be from a specific location, not simply having *a* phone line.

Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi hlamuseliki hi ku kongoma ku vitaniwa ka marito ya Xintariyani?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku vitaniwa ka marito yo tala ka hambana hikuya hi xitwari lexi landzelaka.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Maletere lama u faneleke u ma languta i c na g, tanihi leswi ku vitaniwa ka wona ku ya hi xitwari lexi landzelaka."" (Letters that you need to pronounce as 'c' and 'g', as how they are pronounced depends on the following rule/pattern). This directly relates to pronouncing words differently based on a following pattern/rule.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti r timbirhi ti vitaniwa hilaha ku hambaneke na r yin’we** (Two 'r's are pronounced differently than a single 'r') - While the passage *mentions* this as an example (caro vs. carro), it's not the overarching principle being explained.
* **B: Marito yo tala ma vitaniwa hilaha ma tsariwaka hakona** (Many words are pronounced as they are written) - The passage contradicts this, stating that pronunciation *doesn't* always follow spelling.
* **C: Marito lama nga letere c na g ma nonon’hwa** (Words with the letters 'c' and 'g' are emphasized) - The letters 'c' and 'g' are important, but the passage doesn't say they're *emphasized*; it says their pronunciation *changes* based on the rule.



"
Eka swihlawulekisi leswi landzelaka swa Izmir hi xihi lexi sunguleke emahlweni ka nkarhi wa ximodeni?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti boulevard leti anameke**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ti boulevards leti anameke, miako yo vekiwa ngilazi emahlweni na tindhawu ta mavhengele ta ximodeni ti fuleriwe hi thayilese-to tshuka ta ndhavuko..."" This indicates that the broad boulevards were among the first modern features of Izmir. The other options are described *alongside* the boulevards as part of the modern aesthetic, but the boulevards are presented first.

Therefore, the boulevards are the thing that first stands out as a feature of the modernized city.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki xihlawulekisi xa Izmir?,"The correct answer is **B: Xiyimo xa kona xi kombisa Turkey ya ndhavuko**.

Here's why:

*   The text states Izmir blends ""thayilese-to tshuka ta ndhavuko"" (traditional tiles) and ""makete wa lembe xidzana ra vu 18"" (18th-century markets) with modern elements. It also mentions ""tindhawu ta khale ta vukhongeri ni tikereke"" (old religious sites and churches). This indicates a strong preservation and visible presence of traditional Turkish culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Doroba ri rhendzela ndhawu leyikulu ya swikepe** - While the text mentions Izmir is situated on the coast and harbors, it doesn't state it's a major port area.
*   **C: U nga kuma tindhawu ta mavhengele ta ximodeni ni tikereke ta khale** - The text *does* mention this, but it's a *combination* of old and new, not what makes Izmir unique. It doesn't separate Izmir from other cities with both modern and old areas.
*   **D: Ku ni ndhawu ya swikepe ya vumbirhi hi vukulu eTurkey** - The text states Izmir is the *second-largest* city in Turkey, not the second-largest port area.



"
Rito hanami ri vula ku vona yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku rhumbuka ka cherry**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""loku ku tiviwaka tanihi hanami, wu tshame wu ri xiphemu xa ndhavuko wa Majapani ku sukela hi lembe xidzana ra vu 8."" which translates to ""this is known as hanami, which is a Japanese cultural tradition dating back to the 8th century."" and further clarifies it's about enjoying cherry blossoms (""Ku rhumbuka ka cherry"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Xiphemu xa ndhavuko wa Majapani** - While hanami *is* a Japanese tradition, the question asks *what* hanami is, not what kind of thing it is.
* **C: Ku rhumbuka ka ti plum** - The passage mentions plum blossoms as the origin in China, but hanami specifically refers to cherry blossoms in Japan.
* **D: Imperial Court** - The Imperial Court was involved in the *early practice* of hanami, but it doesn't define what hanami *is*.



"
I mani loyi a rhurheleke swinkhubyana swo sungula leswi a swi endleriwa ku vona ku rhumbuka ka ti-cherry?,"The correct answer is **B: Vaseketeri va ndhavuko wa Majapani** (Japanese nobility).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""EJapan, mintlango yo sungula ya ku rhumbuka ka cherry a yi khomiwa hi mulawuri ntsena na van’wana va le vuhosini kusuhi na Imperial Court.""  This translates to: ""In Japan, the earliest cherry blossom viewings were enjoyed by the aristocracy and others of high status close to the Imperial Court.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mufumi wa le China** (Chinese Emperor) - The passage mentions the tradition originating in China with plum blossoms, but not that the Chinese Emperor specifically popularized it.
*   **C: Mufumi wa Japani** (Japanese Emperor) - While the Imperial Court was involved, the passage says it was the aristocracy *and* others of high status, not just the Emperor.
*   **D: Vaseketeri va ndhavuko wa Machayina** (Chinese nobility) - The passage states the tradition *started* in China, but focuses on who enjoyed it in Japan.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka swilo leswi landzelaka xa Yerusalema hi xihi lexi nga taka xi nga tsakisi ngopfu vapfhumba?","The correct answer is **A: Nkoka wa vukhongeri edorobeni**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Yerusalema is sacred to three major religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) and functions as a spiritual, religious, and cultural center. It emphasizes how important religion is to the city, especially in the Old City, and how it attracts pilgrims.  This makes the importance of religion the most significant factor likely to deeply affect visitors.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Xiyimo xa yona tanihi dorobankulu ra Israel:** While the passage mentions this, it also points out that many countries and the UN do *not* recognize it as Israel’s capital – it’s a contested political point, not necessarily something that directly impacts visitors’ experience.
* **C: Swilo swa ndhavuko:** The passage does mention cultural heritage, but religion is presented as the dominant and most impactful aspect of Yerusalema’s identity.
* **D: Tindhawu to tala ta matimu:** The passage notes the many historical sites, but frames them *within* the context of the city's religious and cultural importance.  The sites themselves are significant *because* of their religious and historical connections.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga boxiwiki eka xiyenge lexi tanihi nchumu lowu Yerusalema ri tiviwaka ha wona?,"The correct answer is **C: Nkoka wa vukhongeri**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Jerusalem is significant to three major religions – Judaism, Christianity, and Islam – and serves as a spiritual, religious, and cultural center. It highlights how important religion is to the city, especially in the Old City.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Matimu lama tsakisaka:** While the passage mentions historical sites, it doesn't frame that as the *primary* way Jerusalem is known.
*   **B: Nkucetelo wa politiki:** The passage *does* mention political dispute, but it's presented as a consequence of its importance, not its defining characteristic.
*   **D: Tindhawu ta ndhavuko:**  Cultural sites are mentioned, but again, religion is presented as the more central theme.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mupfhumba wa muxaka loyi a nga taka a nga pfuneki hi ku xava Wild Card?","The correct answer is **D: Mupfhumba loyi a hlelaka ku endzela Kruger National Park ni phaki yin’wana** (A person who plans to visit Kruger National Park and another park).

Here's why:

The text states that a Wild Card allows access to *multiple* parks within the South African National Parks system. Therefore, someone who plans to visit Kruger *and* another park would benefit most from having a Wild Card, making it worthwhile.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mupfhumba loyi a hlelaka ku endzela ti-SANPark to tala hilaha swi kotekaka hakona?** (A person who plans to visit many SANParks, does it make sense?) - While true, the text specifically focuses on Kruger and the benefit of a Wild Card if visiting *more than one* park.
*   **B: Mupfhumba loyi a endzelaka Kruger National Park ntsena** (A person who only plans to visit Kruger National Park) - The text states a Wild Card is beneficial for multiple parks, not just a single visit to Kruger.
*   **C: Mupfhumba loyi a xiyisisaka tihakelo ta phaki** (A person who investigates park fees) - This is too general. The question asks about the *benefit* of a Wild Card.



"
Hi xihi xivulwa lexi nga yi hlamuseliki hi ku kongoma Kruger National Park?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku ni swiharhi swo hambanahambana hikuya hi tindhawu** (There are diverse ecosystems depending on the areas).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Yin’wana ya ti ndhawu leti vanhu va titsakelaka eka Afrika Dzonga naswona yi tekiwa tanihi ndhuma ya South African National Parks (SANParks). Ku fana na ti phaki hinkwato ta South African National Parks, ku na swilo leswi hlayisiwaka masiku hinkwawo na mali ya ku nghena ephakini. Naswona swi nga pfuna loko munhu a xava Wild Card, leri ri endlaka a kota ku nghena eka phaki leti hlawuriweke ta le Afrika Dzonga kumbe a kota ku nghena eka tiphaki hinkwato ta South African National Parks."" This indicates the park is divided into areas, each supporting different ecosystems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yi tekiwa tanihi ndhawu leyi rhandziwaka eAfrika Dzonga** (It is considered a popular place in South Africa) - While likely true, the passage doesn't *define* Kruger based on its popularity. It states it's a popular *area*.
* **C: Hi yona leyitsongo eka ti-National Park ta Afrika Dzonga** (It is the first of the National Parks in South Africa) - The passage doesn't mention it being the first.
* **D: Yi nga fikeleriwa hi vapfhumba hi ku tirhisa Wild Card** (It can be accessed by members using a Wild Card) - This is a *way* to access the park, not what the park *is*.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga vangaka ngopfu khombo eka vakhandziyi eka swiyenge leswi tlhandlukaka swinene swa ntshava?,"The correct answer is **A: Tindhawu to tsakama (Dangerous spots)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions that the trail can be treacherous (""ku nga va ni nghozi ngopfungopfu loko ku tsakama"" - it can be very dangerous if you slip) and highlights the risk of falling. This makes dangerous spots the most significant hazard for hikers along the varying parts of the trail.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Maribye yo khandziyeka (Hiking paths):** While paths exist, the passage focuses on the *difficulty* and *danger* of the trail, not just the paths themselves.
*   **C: Mabakwa yo khuma (Rocks to climb):** The passage mentions needing to watch your step near the top, implying rocks, but doesn't emphasize climbing as the main challenge.
*   **D: Tinsimbi to khomelela eka tona (Metals to hold onto the rock):** The passage states these are *present* but don’t necessarily make the trail safe, and are only at the edges.



"
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga hlamuseliki hi ku kongoma xiganga xa ntshava ya Machu Picchu lexi hlamuseriwaka eka xiyenge lexi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku hava tinsimbi to khomelela eeka tona eka swiyenge leswi tlhandlukaka ngopfu** (There are no handrails to hold onto on the steepest sections).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Hilaha swi vuriweke hakona, langutela ku hefemuteka, loko u kandziya exigangeni, kambe ku nga va ni nghozi ngopfungopfu loko ku tsakama. Ku ni mabakwa lawa u faneleke u hundza eka wona loko u ri ekusuhi ni le henhlahenhla ka tshava, wona ma le hansi kambe u fanele u manyukuta."" This translates to ""It is reported that it is slippery when climbing the steep sections, but it is not very dangerous if you are careful. There are ropes you need to hold onto when you are near the top of the trail, they are below but you need to be careful.""  The implication is there *aren't* handrails (tinsimbi) on the steepest parts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hambi kuri vakhandziyi lava hanyeke kahle va nga hefemuteka** (Even well-prepared tourists can slip) - This is a general statement about the trail, but not a specific detail about a challenging part.
* **C: U boheka ku hundza ebakweni leri nga ehenhla** (You need to hold ropes near the top) - This is true, but describes a solution *because* of the danger, not the danger itself.
* **D: Swiyenge leswi tlhandlukaka ngopfu swi ni khombo loko ku tsakama** (The steepest sections are treacherous if you fall) - While true, this is a consequence of the steepness and lack of support, not a direct description of the feature.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi i yini lexi nga riki swakudya leswi tolovelekeke swa Majorcan?","The correct answer is **A: Nyama**.

Here's why:

The text states Majorcan cuisine is made with ""swinkwa, matsavu, na nyama (ngopfu ngopfu ya honci)"" – meaning bread, vegetables, and meat (often pork). It then specifically describes *Pa amb Oli* as being made with olive oil, tomatoes, and *other ingredients* like cheese and tuna, **not** meat. 

Therefore, meat isn't a defining ingredient of the specifically *popular* dish mentioned, making it the one thing that isn't directly part of the described *Pa amb Oli*.



"
"Hikuya hi rungula leri nga eka xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xivulwa lexi nga riki ntiyiso hi swakudya leswi vuriwaka hangi?","The correct answer is **D: Hangi ya ku hisa loku humaka endzeni ya kumeka eRotorua**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Etindhawini to tala ta le Rotorua hangi yi swekiwa hi ku hisa loku humaka endzeni ka misava..."" (In many places in Rotorua, hangi is cooked by steaming in the ground). This directly answers the question about where hangi cooked using geothermal steaming is found.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage mentions geothermal steaming, it doesn't say *how* they use local materials for the steaming process.
* **B:** The passage mentions Wellington, but doesn't specify hangi made *with* geothermal steaming is found there. It only says hangi is *found* there.
* **C:** This asks about hangi being a ""comfort food"", which isn't the main focus of the passage. The passage states it's a traditional food.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga boxiwiki tanihi ndlela ya ntolovelo yo hisisa khele ra hangi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku hisa loku humaka endzeni**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Hangi swi swekeriwa ekheleni...etindhawini tin’wana ku hisa loku ku huma endzeni ka misava."" This directly translates to ""Hangi is cooked in a hole...in some places it is cooked by steaming in the ground.""  This describes the primary method of cooking hangi.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gasi** - The passage doesn't mention gas as a cooking method.
*   **B: Maribye yo hisa** - While 'maribye yo hisa' (stones for heating) *are used* in hangi, they aren't the *method* of cooking. They provide the heat *for* the steaming.
*   **D: Maribye yo hisa** - Same reason as B. It's a component, not the method.



"
I yini lexi nga vangelaka ku xiyiwa hi ndlela yo hlawulaka eka monk kumbe nun?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku ambala xifunengeto xa muvala wo vangama** (Wearing a garment of a specific color).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...loko u te na xa wena, ngopfu ngopfu lexi nga na mivala yo vonaka ngopfu, u ta kuma ku nwayitela ku suka eka monk kumbe nun enyangwheni."" (…if you don’t have one, especially one with very good quality colors, you will find yourself wanting to leave the monk or nun immediately). This directly implies that the *color* or type of garment is what could lead to wanting to leave.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku funengeta makatla** (Wearing sandals) - While mentioned, it doesn't directly relate to wanting to leave.
* **C: Ku lomba xo tifunengeta eka monasitiri** (Begging for clothes at the monastery) -  Not mentioned as a reason for wanting to leave.
* **D: Ku ambala xiketi lexi fikaka ehenhla ka matsolo** (Wearing a skirt that reaches above the knees) - The text specifies skirts should *cover* the knees, not be above them.



"
Eka swiambalo leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga tshukaka xi kumeki ku xi lomba eka monasitiri? ,"The correct answer is **A: Swikete**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Loko va endzela yindlu ya ti monk, vavasati va fanele va mbala **swiketi** leswi pfalaka matsolo naswona va fanele va funengeta makatla ya vona."" This directly translates to ""When visiting the monk's house, women should wear **skirts** that cover the knees and should cover their heads.""

The passage also mentions men should wear ""maburuku lama pfalaka matsolo"" (long trousers that cover the knees).  However, the question asks what is specifically mentioned as needing to be worn by someone visiting a monastery.



"
Xana hi rini laha muendzi a nga vaka ni nkarhi wo tala wa languta tinyeleti loko a endzela tindhawu ta le Antarctic?,"The correct answer is **C: Hi tin’hweti ta xixika**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""u ta vona vusiku bya polar, leswi vulaka leswaku dyambu a ri humi."" (You will see polar nights, which mean the sun doesn't rise.) and ""Leswi swi nyiketa nkarhi wa kahle wa ku vona Aurora borealis..."" (This provides a good time to see the Aurora borealis...).  Polar nights and the best viewing of the Aurora Borealis (and Southern Lights) happen during the **winter months** in the Arctic and Antarctic.  ""Tin'hweti ta xixika"" means winter months.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hi tin’hweti ta ximumu** - ""Tin'hweti ta ximumu"" means summer months, when the sun doesn’t set, making stargazing difficult.
*   **B: Loko ndhawu yi nga talanga hi vanhu** - While remote locations are good for dark skies, it doesn't define the *time* of year for optimal viewing.
*   **D: Loko mpimo wa timboni wu nga ri ehenhla** - While altitude can help, it’s not the primary factor determining the best time for stargazing in polar regions.



"
Xana hi rini laha foyini ya sethalayiti yi nga taka yi nga sivi selifoni?,"The correct answer is **A: Loko ndlela ya sethalayiti yo tshuka yi siveriwa** (When the satellite signal is disrupted/lost).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Foyini ya sethalayiti ku nga va hi yona ntsena leyi u nga yihlawulaka."" (Satellite internet can be the only option when you cannot afford another).  It also implies that satellite internet is a fallback when other options *aren't* available. A disrupted signal would be a reason why you *need* to rely on satellite internet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Loko ndhawu ya kona yi ri ekule swinene** (When the local area is very rural) - While satellite internet is *often* used in rural areas, the passage doesn't say it's *required* because of rural location.
* **C: Loko yi ta tirhisiwa ehandle** (When it will be used outdoors) -  The passage doesn't link satellite internet to outdoor use.
* **D: Loko pfhumba ri ri ni swilaveko swo karhi swa data** (When the family has limited data) - While the passage mentions data, it doesn’t specify it being a *reason* to use satellite internet. It is more about the overall cost and availability.



"
Xana hi rini laha foyini ya sethalayiti yi nga antswaka ku tlula selifoni?,"The correct answer is **C: Loko ku nga laveki data ya le tlhelo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Foyini ya sethalayiti ku nga va hi yona ntsena leyi u nga yihlawulaka...Loyi yo nga antswaka ku tlula selifoni loko ku nga laveki data ya le tlhelo.""  This directly translates to ""Satellite phones can be your only option when there is no network coverage...They are better than cell phones when there is no network coverage.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Loko u endzele edorobeni:** Cities generally *have* cell phone coverage.
*   **B: Hi nkarhi wa riendzo ra xikepe:** While satellite phones *can* be used on ships, it isn't the primary reason they're superior.  Cell coverage is increasingly available near coastlines.
*   **D: Loko u ta kota ku amukela netiweke leyinene ya selifoni:**  This is the opposite of when a satellite phone would be preferred.



"
Ku simekiwa ka Transnistria Republic ku vangiwe hi lwetana hi yini eka leswi landzelaka?,"The correct answer is **B: Mindhavuko**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hi 1994, ku nga twani loku ku endle leswaku van’wana va sungula Rhiphabuliki Ya Transnistria evuxeni bya Moldova, leyi nga na mfumo wa yona n’wini na mali kambe a ri tiveki eka matiko hinkwawo lama nga swirho swa UN."" This directly implies that disagreements among the diverse ethnic groups (mindhavuko) within Moldova led to the formation of the Transnistria Republic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ikhonomi:** While the text mentions economic challenges, it doesn't state that these were the *cause* of Transnistria's formation.
*   **C: Ririmi:** The text notes language differences (Russian vs. Romanian), but doesn't directly link them as the primary driver of separation.
*   **D: Vukhongeri:** Religion is mentioned as a significant aspect of Moldova, but not as a cause for the Transnistria conflict.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi Rhiphabuliki Ya Transnistria yi nga na xona lexi hambaneke na Moldova hinkwayo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku amukeriwa hi UN**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Transnistria ""a ri tiveki eka matiko hinkwawo lama nga swirho swa UN"" (is not recognized by all UN member states). This is a key difference between Transnistria and Moldova, which *is* a recognized country.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ririmi:** The passage states both areas speak Romanian (though Transnistria also uses Russian), so language isn't the key difference.
*   **B: Vukhongeri:** Both predominantly practice Orthodox Christianity.
*   **D: Muxaka wa mali:** The passage says Transnistria has its own currency, but doesn't state this is a difference from Moldova overall - just a feature of Transnistria's self-governance.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana hi rini laha muendzi a faneleke ku endzela Montevideo loko a lava ku papalata mimoya?","The correct answer is **A: Hi tin’hweti ta xixika ta Northern Hemisphere**.

Here's why:

The text states that Montevideo is in the Southern Hemisphere, and therefore when it's summer (hot, +30°C) in the Southern Hemisphere, it's winter (cold) in the Northern Hemisphere. The question asks when to visit to *avoid* the heat.  Visiting during the Northern Hemisphere's summer months (which correspond to Montevideo's winter months) would provide cooler temperatures for enjoying the city.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hi nkarhi wo pfumala mpfula le Montevideo:** The text says rainfall is consistent throughout the year, not concentrated in a rainy season.
* **C: Hi tin’hweti ta ximumu xa Northern Hemisphere:** This would be Montevideo's summer, the hottest time of year, which is what the traveler wants to avoid.
* **D: Hi tin’hweti ta xixika ta Montevideo:** This doesn’t relate to avoiding the heat, just states it’s cooler in that period.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana hi rini laha muendzi a faneleke ku endzela Montevideo loko a nga ma rhandzi ngopfu maxelo yo hola?","The correct answer is **A: Loko ku ri ximumu le Montevideo**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Montevideo yi le subtropics; hi ximumu ri tala ku hisa +30°C."" (Montevideo is in the subtropics; in summer the temperature often reaches +30°C.)
* The question asks when is the best time to visit for warm weather.  The text directly links warm weather (high temperatures) to the summer in Montevideo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Loko ku ri ximumu le Northern Hemisphere:** Montevideo is in the Southern Hemisphere, so the Northern Hemisphere's summer is its winter.
* **C: Loko ku ri nguva ya mpfula le Montevideo:** The text says rainfall is even throughout the year, so a rainy season isn't a good indicator of warm weather.
* **D: Loko ku ri xixika le Northern Hemisphere:** Again, this refers to the Northern Hemisphere, which is irrelevant to Montevideo's climate.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga fambisanaka ni loyi a mpfampfarhutaka emakhumbini leswi vitaniwaka girafiti, ku hambana ni ku onha nhundzu?","The correct answer is **A: Swiendlakalo swa girafiti** (Graffiti events).

Here's why:

* **The passage directly contrasts legal, permitted graffiti events with illegal vandalism.** It states that while older forms of graffiti might have been done with the intent to cause trouble (""onha nhundzu""), *now* there are permitted graffiti artists and spaces (""vampfampfarhuti va tigirafiti va le nawini, mintlangu yo mpfampfarhuta ni makhumbi lawa va pfumeleriwaka ku mpfampfarhuta eka wona""). This is a key distinction.
* The passage is *about* the context of graffiti - its evolution from vandalism to a potentially sanctioned art form. ""Swiendlakalo swa girafiti"" best captures this modern, organized aspect.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku halahala (Chaos)** - While illegal graffiti *can* create chaos, the passage focuses on the difference between that and *organized* graffiti.
* **C: Swifaniso leswi laviwiki emiakweni ya rixaka (Pictures that are alive in the corners of the road)** - This is descriptive of graffiti in general, but doesn't highlight the crucial distinction the passage makes.
* **D: Switsariwa leswi nga faneriki (Visible things)** - Too broad. Graffiti is visible, but the passage isn't about visibility; it's about legality and intention.

Hi swihi swiphemu swa minkhuvo ya vuyimbeleri leswi van’wana va swi tekaka swi ri swa nkoka eku tiphineni ka vona?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku ndzima matende (Collecting firewood)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...vunyingi bya lava teke eka minkhuvo ya vuyimbeleri va hlawula ku dzima matende endhawini yoleyo..."" (Many people who go to the forest collect firewood in that area...).  It highlights firewood collection as a key activity and reason people visit the forest.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku famba ni vana va wena (Walking with your children):** While the passage mentions areas with danger for children, it doesn't state this is *why* people value the forest.
*   **C: Ku tlangiwa ka vuyimbeleri ku ya fika ni vusiku (The forest being haunted until night):** This describes a danger/belief about the forest, not something people value.
*   **D: Ku hatla u fika (Having to walk a long way to get there):** This describes the *difficulty* of reaching the forest, not a benefit or reason for valuing it.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana loyi a yaka enkhubyeni lowu u faneleke ku rhangisa yini emahlweni loko a lava ku dzima tende ekusuhi ni vuyimbeleri?","The correct answer is **D: Ku hatla u fika**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Loko u lava ku swi vonela ekusuhi, u fanele u hatla u fika u ta kuma ndhawu yo dzima ka yona tende leyi nga ekusuhi ni ntlawa wa vayimbeleri."" This directly translates to ""If you want to see it closely, you must hurry to reach the place where you can extinguish the fire near the performers.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku fika nivusiku swinene** (To arrive very late at night) - The passage mentions darkness but doesn't suggest arriving *late* is necessary, only that the fire might be visible at night.
* **B: Ku tshama endhawini ya mindyangu** (To stay in the area of the youth) -  The passage mentions an area with youths, but doesn't say you need to stay there to extinguish the fire.
* **C: Ku dzima tende endhawini ya le tlhelo** (To extinguish the fire in the area of the platform) - The passage doesn't specifically mention a platform, but focuses on getting *close* to the performers.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana hi kwihi laha vaendzi va fanele va ku papalata loko lava ku tihungasa ni vusiku le New Mexico?","The correct answer is **D: Tikhasino**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Tikhasino hinkwato leti xaxametiweke laha, ta xavisa swakunwa, tin’wana ti hungasa vahlaleri hi xikongomelo xo navetisa (ngopfungopfu letikulu leti nga ekusuhi na doroba ra Albuquerque ni ra Santa Fe).""  This translates to ""All casinos are located there, offering drinks, some offering accommodation with the intention of attracting (especially large ones near Albuquerque and Santa Fe)."" 

The question asks where visitors should go if they want entertainment and nightlife. The passage directly links casinos to providing both.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pueblos:** While culturally significant, the passage doesn't mention Pueblos offering nightlife or entertainment.
*   **B: Etibarheni letitsongo edorobeni:** The passage states bars in cities are *not* attractive to visitors.
*   **C: Tindhawu ta mavhengele:** The passage doesn't mention any connection between scenic areas and entertainment.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana hi kwihi laha muendzi a nga tshuka a kuma vuhungasi lebyi dumeke le New Mexico?","The correct answer is **C: Ekhasino ya le kusuhi na Sante-Fe**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tikhasino hinkwato leti xaxametiweke laha, ta xavisa swakunwa, tin’wana ti hungasa vahlaleri hi xikongomelo xo navetisa (ngopfungopfu letikulu leti nga ekusuhi na doroba ra Albuquerque ni ra Santa Fe).""  This directly translates to ""All the casinos there offer drinks, some even accommodate guests with the intention of getting drunk (especially the large ones near the cities of Albuquerque and Santa Fe).""

* **The question asks:** Where can a tourist find reliable entertainment in New Mexico?

* While casinos near Albuquerque are mentioned, the passage emphasizes those near **Santa Fe** as being more focused on entertainment and potentially lodging.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ekhasino ya mpfhuka wa tiawara timbirhi ku suka le Albuquerque:** The passage doesn't highlight this as a particularly reliable or focused entertainment option.
* **B: Eka pueblo ya le tlhelo:** The passage doesn't mention pueblos as entertainment destinations.
* **D: Ebarheni leyitsongo edorobeni:** The passage specifically notes that bars in cities aren't as appealing to visitors.



"
Vapfhumba lava xiyisisaka ku tirhisa ka vona mali va nga papalata swonwa swihi?,"The correct answer is **B: Mati ya le bodlheleni**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mati ya le mpompini ya kwalaho ma basile swinene lerova ma nga nwiwa kambe lama nga eka mabodlhela ma kumeka hi ku olova loko u chava ku nwa ya le mpompini."" This translates to ""Water from the well is very expensive and not drinkable, but water from the borehole can be found by paying (to drill) when you want to drink from the well.""  This clearly indicates people pay for borehole water.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vhinyo ya le Australia:** The text mentions coffee preferences in Australia, but doesn't say people pay for it specifically.
*   **C: Byala bya ndhawu:** The text talks about different types of beer (""Number One"" and ""Manta""), but doesn't mention cost or payment.
*   **D: Juzi:** The text mentions juice being made with fruit, but doesn't indicate a cost associated with obtaining it.



"
"Hi ku landza ndhawu leyi hlamuseriwaka eka xiyenge lexi, hi tihi tiodara ta swonwa leti nga tshukaka ti kanganyisa muphameri?","The correct answer is **D: Leswi vuriwaka flat white**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Eka vanhu va le Australia, khofi leyi cheriwaka meleke wutsongo va yi teka yi ri ya le ntsungeni.""  This directly describes a flat white – coffee served with a small amount of steamed milk, making it a ""melaka wutsongo"" (slightly milky) coffee.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Short black:** While mentioned as a type of coffee, the passage doesn't say it's popular or causes confusion.
* **B: Number One:** This refers to a type of beer, not a coffee drink that causes a specific ordering issue.
* **C: Sauvignon Blanc ya le New Zealand:** This is a wine, not a coffee drink.



"
"Nguva ya vukoloni yi sunguriwe hi ntlawa wihi, leyi tekeke malembe xidzana manharhu?","The correct answer is **D: Vaaki va Spain**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tiko ra Spania ri sungule ku lawula matiko man’wana naswona ri endle tano ku ringana malembe ya madzana manharhu."" This translates to ""Spain began to rule other countries and continued to do so for centuries."" 

The passage clearly identifies the Spanish as initiating the colonial period and maintaining control for a long duration. While the Guaraní, Payaguá, and Guaycurú were indigenous groups present in Paraguay, they were the ones *being* colonized, not the colonizers.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi yihi ndlela leyinene yo kota ku tsakeriwa hi Vaperesiya?","The correct answer is **D: Ku va ni matikhomelo yo pfumala nhlonipho** (To have manners that show respect).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Parisians value politeness and good manners (""va ni nkanu"", ""bien élevé""). It emphasizes that behaving respectfully will make your experience in Paris smoother and prevent issues (""ku endla leswaku ku famba famba ka wena ku olova"", ""ku hatla ku haha"").

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ku ringeta ku tekelela langutelo ra vona** (To try to understand their language) - While helpful, it's not the *primary* way to avoid offense as highlighted in the text.
* **B: Ku kombisa ku titshemba** (To show confidence) - Confidence isn't mentioned as a key factor in the passage.
* **C: Ku endla hi moya wo rhula** (To act calmly) -  Calmness is good, but the text focuses specifically on *respectful* behavior.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga tekiwiki tanihi ndhuma yo tianakanya ya Vaperesiya?","The correct answer is **B: Ku pfuma nhlonipho** (Showing respect).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ku pfumala nhlonipho ni yo va ni nkanu."" (Showing respect and being polite). It then goes on to elaborate how important respect is in Parisian society and how it will make your experience smoother.  The passage directly links being ""bien élevé"" (well-mannered) to respecting Parisians.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nkanu** (Politeness) - While related to respect, the passage focuses *on the act of showing* respect, not just being polite in general.  Politeness is a component of showing respect.
* **C: Misavu** (Customs) - The passage *mentions* Parisian customs, but the core message is about respect *towards* the people, not just adhering to customs.
* **D: Ku phuphurhuka** (To be arrogant) - This is the *opposite* of what the passage advocates.



"
Hi byihi vuyelo bya Tlilasi yo Sungula eka MetroRail ya le Cape Town?,"The correct answer is **B: A ti talelanga hi vanhu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""MetroPlus ya tsakisa ende a yi talelanga hi vanhu"" which translates to ""MetroPlus is luxurious and is not crowded.""  This directly answers the question about the benefit of the ""Tlilasi Yo Sungula"" (First Class - which is MetroPlus).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Torokosi ra kona ra le mahlweni ka xitimela** - While it mentions MetroPlus tokens are at the front, this isn't a *benefit* to the rider.
*   **C: A ri durhi ngopfu ku fana ni thikithi ra Tlilasi ya Vunharhu** - The text says it's faster, but doesn't compare the price to the other ticket.
*   **D: Ntsengo wa rona wu fana ni thikithi ra Metro** - The text doesn't mention the price.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi lexi xitimela xin’wana ni xin’wana xa vakhandziyi xi nga na xona le Cape Town?","The correct answer is **D: Matorokisi ya tlilasi yo Sungula ni ya Vumbirhi** (Tokens of the First Class and Regional Class).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Xitimela xin’wana ni xin’wana xi na matorokisi ya MetroPlus ni ya Metro"" which translates to ""Each train has MetroPlus and Metro tokens.""  MetroPlus is also referred to as ""Tlilasi Yo Sungula"" (First Class) and Metro as ""Tlilasi Ya Vunharhu"" (Regional Class).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Torokosi ra Metro leri nga talangiki vanhu** (Metro token that is not used by people) - This is only true of MetroPlus, not all trains.
* **B: Ntsengo lowu fanaka eka titlilasi hatimbirhi** (Equal price for both classes) - The passage doesn't mention price.
* **C: Titlilasi tinharhu leti nga faniki** (Regional classes that are equal) - The passage doesn't discuss equality between the classes.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka i ini lexi xifuwo xi nga tshukaka xi nga xi endli?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku vangela aleji**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) specifically lists ""ku vangela aleji"" (causing allergies) as one of the things that makes a creature undesirable – a ""swifuwo"" (pest/nuisance). The other options aren't mentioned in the passage as characteristics of these undesirable creatures.

*   **A: Ku vangela swirhumbana** (causing confusion) - Not mentioned.
*   **C: Ku hangalasa ntluleto** (disturbing sleep) - Not mentioned.
*   **D: Ku vavisa hi vukarhi** (attacking with strength) - While the passage mentions harm, it specifies through poison or causing death, not just general attacks.



"
Xana makhadi ya tifoyini lama hakeleriwaka ma nga xaviwa kwihi?,"The correct answer is **D: Eka tifoyini to hakeleriwa** (On/At the activated/enabled phones).

Here's why:

The passage states that the cards are used *with* phones that have been activated or enabled (""Xitolo xin’wana ni xin’wana xi tele hi makhadi ya tifoyini lama hakeleriwaka..."").  The whole point is their relationship to those phones.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ematikweni yo karhi** (In different countries) - The passage doesn't mention anything about countries.
* **B: Eswitichini swa switimela** (At railway switches) - This is completely unrelated to the text.
* **C: Eswitolo swa le khoneni** (At street corners) -  Also unrelated to the text.



"
Xana mitsengo leyi antswaka yo foyini yi kotisa ku yini ku nyikeriwa hi makhadi man’wana lama tirhisiwaka?,"The correct answer is **D: Hi ku tirhisa foyini yo hakeleriwa ni ku hakela ntsengo lowu engetelekeke** (By using a secured connection and paying an additional fee).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where some cards are better for certain types of transactions (like international ones) and may charge extra fees.** This directly aligns with needing a ""secured connection"" (implied by the card being ""hakeleriwaka"" - secured) and an ""additional fee"" (""ntsengo lowu engetelekeke"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yi nga fikeleriwa ntsena ematikweni yo karhi** (It cannot be used in certain countries) - The passage doesn't say cards *can't* be used in countries, just that some are *better* for international use.
* **B: Hi ku tirhisa tinomboro ta mahala** (By using toll-free numbers) - The passage mentions avoiding needing to dial a number, not using toll-free numbers.
* **C: Exitolo xa le khoneni** (The price is at the corner) - This is irrelevant to the passage's topic.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka misinya leyi landzelaka hi wihi lowu nga talangiki ephakini ya swiharhi ya Mativa ya Plitvice?","The correct answer is **B: Oak**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the forest is made up of beech, spruce, and fir. It *doesn't* mention oak. Therefore, oak is the one tree not listed as being present in the Mativa Ya Plitvice forest.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi swihi swimila leswi tolovelekangiki leswi kumekaka ephakini ya swiharhi ya Mativa ya Plitivice?,"The correct answer is **D: Capercaillie**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""...na **ti capercaillie** swi nga kumeka eka dhawu yoleyo, na swin’wana swiharhi swa mixaka leyi fanaka."" This means capercaillie are found within the Plitvice Lakes National Park.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Turkey:** While turkeys exist, the text doesn't mention them.
*   **B: Honey Badger:** The text doesn't mention honey badgers.
*   **C: Cassowary:** Cassowaries are native to Australia and New Guinea, not Europe where Plitvice Lakes is located.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana tikhowudi ta tindhawu ti pfuna ha yini?","The correct answer is **A: Ku kopiwa ka tidisiki** (Copying of discs).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""tikhowudi ta ndhawu abyi khumbi ni katsonga ku kopiwa loku ku nga riki nawini; ku kopa ka diski ka ntsongo ni kantsongo ku ta tlanga kahle eka divayisi yin’wana ni yin’wana leyi pfumalaka diski ya ntiyiso.""  This translates to ""Local codes do not prevent unauthorized copying; copying from disc to disc will work well on any device that reads the verification disc."" 

This directly relates to the *copying of discs* being the function of the codes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku lawula vuxavi (Controlling access):** While related to piracy, the passage focuses on the *ability to copy* not restricting who can access the content.
* **C: Ku siva piracy (Preventing piracy):** The passage states the codes *don't* prevent piracy, they just allow copying.
* **D: Ku kopa swi nga ri enawini (Copying without authorization):**  This describes the *action* being allowed, not the function of the codes themselves.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga mavunwa hi tikhowudi ta ndhawu lexi vuriwaka hi tikhamphani ta ku vika mahungu?","The correct answer is **B: Ti pfuna ku papalata ku kopiwa swi nga ri enawini** (They aim to prevent unauthorized copying).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""tikhowudi ta ndhawu abyi khumbi ni katsonga ku kopiwa loku ku nga riki nawini"" (local codes prevent unauthorized copying). This directly aligns with preventing piracy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ta laveka leswaku u u lawula vuxavi** (They require you to control access) - While access control *could* be a part of it, the passage focuses on *preventing* the copying itself, not just controlling who sees it.
* **C: Ta pfuna eku endleni mali hi ku olova** (They aim to make money by selling) - The passage mentions increased profits for companies, but the code's *purpose* isn't to directly sell things. It's to protect against piracy, which then *allows* for more legitimate sales.
* **D: A ti tali hi ku pfuna eka ku siva piracy** (They don't relate to preventing piracy) - This is the opposite of what the passage says! The entire text is *about* how these codes are used to combat piracy.



"
"Loko u fika eka tiko ra ka n’wina, hi rihi endlelo leri nga tolovelekangiki?","The correct answer is **A: Ku kamba vupfhumba**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly states:** ""Hambileswi loko u fika eka ndhawu ya ka n’wina va nga kambisisiki swa vupfhumba bya wena...""  This translates to ""When you arrive at another person's place, do not display your wealth or brag.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku paluxa nhundzu (Giving gifts):** While gift-giving is often polite, the passage doesn't mention it as something to avoid.
* **C: Mpimo wa nawu wa nhundzu (Measuring the gifts):** This isn't mentioned and seems irrelevant to the advice.
* **D: Ku lawula swilo swo nghena na swona (Controlling what you bring with you):**  While being mindful of what you bring is good manners, the passage focuses specifically on *displaying* wealth, not simply bringing belongings.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi u faneleke u xi tiva u nga si fika eka tiko ra ka n’wina?,"The correct answer is **A: Loko ku ta va ni ku kambiwa ka vupfhumba**.

Here's why:

The original text (P) specifically states you shouldn't bring things that could be seen as suspicious (""vupfhumba"") or cause issues with customs (""ku lavisisa hi swa xinawu"").  It emphasizes knowing what you *are allowed* to bring.  Therefore, knowing you might be searched (""ku kambiwa ka vupfhumba"") is the most relevant thing to be aware of *before* arriving at someone else's place/country.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Loko u boheka ku paluxa swilo leswi tlulaka mpimo wa mpfumelelo** (When you are worried about declaring things that exceed the allowance) - This is a consequence of *having* something you shouldn't, not a preventative thing to know beforehand.
* **C: Loko ku ta va ku lawuriwa ka swilo swo nghena na swona** (When things you are bringing will be inspected) - Inspection is part of the potential search (vupfhumba), so A is more fundamental.
* **D: Loko nhundzu yo karhi leyi u nghenaka na yona yi pfumeleriwa** (When the item you are bringing is allowed) - While important, the text focuses on *avoiding* trouble, and knowing what's allowed is a reaction to the risk of a search.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i ku tala ka yini leswi pfunaka vakhandziyi ku hambeta va kuma tindlela letintshwa eka Nawu wa Cochamó?","The correct answer is **D: Makhumbi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Nambu wa Cochamo...yi ni **makhumbi lamakulu** ya maribye ni tintshava. Vakhandziyi lava humaka etindhawini to hambanahambana emisaveni hinkwayo va ya emahlweni va pfula **tindlela emakhumbini**.""  This directly links the large cliffs (makhumbi) to the reason tourists come to climb.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku vona swo saseka** (Seeing beautiful things) - While the area is likely beautiful, the passage focuses on *climbing*, not just sightseeing.
*   **B: Switshabyana** (Streams) - These are mentioned, but not as the primary attraction.
*   **C: Tinhlohlori** (Forests) - Forests are part of the landscape, but not the main reason people visit specifically to climb.



"
"Eka xiyenge lexi nyikeriweke laha, hi xihi xihahampfhuka lexi hlanganisaka tindhawu to tala le Southern Hemisphere?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hambiswiritano, Star Alliance yi hlanganisa hinkwato handle ka vuxeni bya South Pacific ku suka eSantiago de Chile kuya eTahiti, leyi nga xihaha mpfhuka xa LATAM lexi hlanganisaka misava hinkwayo."" 

This directly says Star Alliance covers a lot of ground in the South Pacific, connecting many islands.  The text also explicitly states SkyTeam *doesn't* have extensive South Pacific routes.



"
Hi wihi nhlangano wa swihahampfhuka lowu hlanganisa mpfhuka lowutsongo wa le lwandle le Southern Hemisphere?,"The correct answer is **A: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hambiswiritano, Star Alliance yi hlanganisa hinkwato handle ka vuxeni bya South Pacific ku suka eSantiago de Chile kuya eTahiti, leyi nga xihaha mpfhuka xa LATAM lexi hlanganisaka misava hinkwayo Xihaha mpfhuka lexi a xi wexe loko u lava ku hundza eSouth Pacific ns vupela dyambu bya Amerika Dyonga."" 

This directly says Star Alliance covers routes within the South Pacific (Southern Hemisphere). The other options are either regions (South Pacific) or airlines/alliances not described as having this comprehensive coverage (LATAM Oneworld, SkyTeam).



"
Hi wihi nhlangano wa vuvalangi lowu siveke Global Running Tours?,"The correct answer is **A: Running Copenhagen**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...mapfhumba yo tsutsuma ya le Barcelona ni ya le Copenhagen ma joyiniwe hi mapfhumba yo tsusuma ya le Prague ni man’wana."" (The running groups of Barcelona and Copenhagen joined with the running groups of Prague and others).  This indicates Copenhagen is a key location involved in the formation of the group.  Since the question asks about the origin of ""Global Running Tours"", and Copenhagen is explicitly mentioned as a founding/joining location, Running Copenhagen is the most logical answer.

The other options are less likely:

*   **B: Go Running Tours** - Not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Running Tours Prague** - Prague joined *with* Barcelona and Copenhagen, it wasn't the originator.
*   **D: Running Tours Barcelona** - Barcelona joined *with* Copenhagen and Prague, it wasn't the originator.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, Go Running Tours yi pfuna ku hlanganisa mihlangano yingani yo hambana yo valanga?","The correct answer is **B: 200**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku ni kwalomu ka mihlangano yo tsutsuma ya kwalomu ka **200** emisaveni hinkwayo."" This directly translates to ""There is a focus on organizing **200** running events across all cities.""

Therefore, Go Running Tours aims to connect **200** different running events.



"
Xana mupfhumba u fanele ku endla yini loko a lava ku tshuka a vona xikanka?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku tirhisa swilo swo vona swiharhi swi ri ekule**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...tinghala, tikanka (cheetahs) na tiyingwe a ti swi lavi ku voniwa naswona ti voniwa kahle hi **swilo swo tirhisiwa ku vona kule**.""  This directly translates to ""cheetahs and leopards are difficult to see and are seen well with **tools used to see them far away**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku ya eka safari yo hayika** - While going on safari is part of seeing animals, it doesn't specifically address *how* to see a cheetah.
*   **B: Ku famba hi milenge ekhwatini** - This refers to the general act of safari travel, not a specific technique for spotting cheetahs.
*   **D: Ku famba hi movha ni ku tirhisa xitirhisiwa xa ntolovelo** - While moving and using binoculars might help, the passage specifically emphasizes the *tools used to see them far away* (swilo swo vona swiharhi swi ri ekule).

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i muxaka wihi wa xiharhi lowu mupfhumba a nga tshukaka a hlanga na xona loko a famba hi movha ku valanga swiharhi?","The correct answer is **C: Tiyingwe** (Leopards).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Minkarhi yin'wana tinghala, **tikanka (cheetahs) na tiyingwe** a ti swi lavi ku voniwa naswona ti voniwa kahle hi swilo swo tirhisiwa ku vona kule.""  This translates to ""Sometimes lions, cheetahs and **leopards** are difficult to see and are best seen with things used to see them from afar.""

This implies leopards are particularly elusive and harder to spot on safari. The question asks which animal a safari-goer might struggle to see, making tiyingwe the most accurate answer.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga hungutaka ntsengo wa riendzo ro valanga?","The correct answer is **B: Ku famba tanihi ntlawa** (Traveling as a group).

Here's why:

The passage (P) discusses how prices increase when traveling alone or with a companion, but *decrease* when traveling *with a group* (""ntlawa""). The speaker explicitly states that being part of a group makes it cheaper, referencing how funeral societies pool resources.  The question (Q) asks what influences the price of travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku famba u ri wexe?** (Traveling alone?) - The passage says this *increases* the price.
* **C: Ku famba na munhu un’wana** (Traveling with one person) - This *increases* the price.
* **D: Ku kuma ntlawa wa ntsevu kumbe ku tlula** (Finding a group of elders or surpassing) - This is not discussed as a price factor in the passage.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi a nga tshukaka a kuma ntsengo wo chipa wa riendzo ro valanga?","The correct answer is **A: Vaendzi lava tiyimiseleke ku cincacinca mimovha** (Travelers who are determined to change routes).

Here's why:

The passage states that traveling alone is dangerous (""kutani loko u famba u ri wexe kumbe ni munghana wun’we ringeta ku tihlanganisa ni van’wana mi va ntlawa va vanhu va mune kumbe va ntsevu swi ta antswa"").  It then contrasts this with large groups being robbed.  The implication is that those who *intentionally* deviate from standard routes (to avoid paying tolls - ""engelela mali"") are the ones most vulnerable to being ambushed and robbed.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ntlawa wa vanhu vanharhu (Groups of old people):** The passage doesn't specifically mention old people being targeted.
* **C: Vanghana vambirhi lava fambaka swin’we (Two friends traveling together):** While traveling with one person is risky, the passage emphasizes *alone* being the biggest risk.
* **D: Ntlawa wa vanhu va ntlhanu (Groups of five people):** The passage explicitly states larger groups are safer, not more vulnerable.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi hoxeke xandla leswaku San Francisco yi tekeriwa enhlokweni?","The correct answer is **C: Ikhonomi ya yona leyi titshegeke hi swo tala** (Its diverse economy).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Hambileswi ekhonomi ya San Francisco yi susumetiwaka hi leswi ri nga ndhawu leyi kokaka vapfhumba emisaveni hinkwayo, ikhonomi ya yona yi titshege hi swo tala."" (Despite the economic challenges of being a coastal city, its economy is diverse.) This is the central theme of the first sentence and a key reason for San Francisco's prominence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku hamba yi va kona eka mixaka yo hlaya ya vutshila ni lava vikaka mahungu** (Being a hub for high-tech and entrepreneurs) - While mentioned, this is a *part* of the economy, not the overarching reason for its importance.
* **B: Miako ya xiyimo xa le henhla yo hlangana eka yona** (High-end infrastructure converges on it) - This is mentioned as a *result* of San Francisco’s development, not the reason it’s prominent.
* **D: Xivono lexi endlaka nhluvuko xa swakudya swa le Asia** (A vision that fosters the development of Asian cuisine) -  Asian cuisine is a feature *within* San Francisco, but not the core reason it’s a leading city.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka i yini lexi nga riki ntiyiso hi San Francisco?","The correct answer is **A: Yi kombisiwe ko tala eka timuvhi ni tibuku** (It is often featured in movies and books).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ndlela leyi yi kombisiwaka ha yona eka vuyimbeleri, tifilimi, matsalwa ni ndhavuko lowu dumeke swi pfunile leswaku doroba ni tindhawu ta rona to hlawule ka ti tiviwa misava hinkwayo.""  This translates to ""It is depicted in art, films, literature, and popular culture, which has helped the city and its surroundings benefit from tourism.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Swakudya swa le Asia swi tele** (There is a lot of Asian food) - The passage *does* mention a variety of Asian cuisines, so this is a true statement *about* San Francisco, but it isn't what the passage emphasizes as a defining characteristic.
* **C: Ku ni tihotela to tala ni tindhawu to khoma mihlangano** (There are many hotels and conference venues) - The passage mentions hotels and convention spaces, but doesn't present it as a key feature.
* **D: Ikhonomi ya kona yi titshege hi vupfhumba hi ku helela** (The economy is driven by tourism primarily) - While tourism is important, the passage says the economy is based on multiple sectors (education, government, finance, tech, and tourism).



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i muxaka wihi wa mupfhumba loyi a nga tshukaka a nga vuyeriwi hi ku tirhisa vukorhokeri bya muyimeri wa swo famba?","The correct answer is **C: Mupfhumba loyi a nga si kumaka vhisa yakwe (A traveler who cannot present their visa)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the travel agent can assist with obtaining documents like visas. It also mentions they can ""hlayisela ndhawu leyi va ku bukeleke yona loko wa ha lava nkarhi wo ehleketa ha yona kumbe wo lava tidokumente tin’wana ta laha u yaka kona (hi xikombiso, visa).""  This directly implies a traveler *needs* assistance with documents like a visa to be helped by the agent.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mupfhumba loyi a tsandzekaka ku endla xiboho (A traveler who is afraid to commit fraud):** The passage doesn't mention anything about fraud or a traveler's fear of it.
* **B: Mupfhumba loyi a endlaka xiboho hi xihatla (A traveler who commits fraud intentionally):**  Similar to A, this is not addressed in the text.
* **D: Mupfhumba loyi a tsakelaka ku buka tiphakeji (A traveler who wants to book packages):** The passage says travel agents *offer* packages, but it doesn't say they only help those interested in packages. They help with broader travel needs.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi nga boxiwangiki eka xiyenge lexi tanihi vuyelo bya ku buma hi ku tirhisa muyimeri wa vupfhumba?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku hatlisisiwa ka mapapila yo famba (Visa processing)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...va nga tlhela va ku hlayisela ndhawu leyi va ku bukeleke yona loko wa ha lava nkarhi wo ehleketa ha yona kumbe wo lava tidokumente tin’wana ta laha u yaka kona (hi xikombiso, visa).""  This directly refers to the agent helping with travel documents like visas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mitsengo ya tihotela (Hotel prices):** The passage mentions hotels, but doesn't suggest the agent handles pricing.
* **C: Tiphakeji leti katsaka hinkwaswo (All-inclusive packages):** While agents *offer* packages, this isn't something specifically they *handle* that a hotel wouldn't.
* **D: Ku vekisa ndhawu (Finding accommodation):** The passage states you can book accommodation yourself, or use the agent, so it's not exclusive to the agent.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana switirhisiwa leswi kotaka ku hundzuluxela tsalwa swi tsandzeka ku endla yini?","The correct answer is **A: Ku hundzuluxela mifungho ya tindzimi ta matiko mambe** (To translate sentences from different languages).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Switirhisiwa leswi kotaka ku hundzuluxela tsalwa – hi switirhisiwa leswi kotaka ku hundzuluxela tilayini hinkwato ta tsalwa ku sukela eka ririmi rin’wana ku ya eka rin’wana."" This directly translates to ""Tools for translating text - these tools are used to translate entire lines of text from one language to another.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku hundzuluxela swiyenge hinkwaswo swa marito** (To translate all parts of speech) - The passage doesn't focus on *how* it translates, just *that* it translates.
* **C: Ku hundzuluxela marito lama nga eka swilo hi ku tirhisa foni ya manguva lawa** (To translate words about things using a mobile phone) - While the passage *mentions* using a mobile phone for context, it's not the primary function.
* **D: Ku hundzuluxela hi ku pakanisa ka 100%** (To translate with 100% accuracy) - The passage *acknowledges* that translations aren't always perfect (""ku toloveleke leswaku ti hundzulxa kahle (swa kala ku kuma vuhundzuluxeri lebyi hoxeke)"").



"
I yini lexi pfumelelaka vuhundzuluxeri ku endliwa u nga pfulanga inthanete?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku dawuniloda rungula ra ririmi** (Downloading the language pack).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Google Translate ""yi ku pfumelelaka leswaku u hundzuluxeriwa hambiloko u nga nghenanga eka inthanete endzhaku ka ku dawunilowda data ya ririmi leri u ri lavaka"" – meaning it allows translation even offline by downloading the language data.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Switirhisiwa leswi antswisiweke swo hundzuluxela** (Advanced translation tools) - While the passage mentions advanced tools, it doesn't say they enable offline translation.
*   **B: Tifoni ta manguva lawa** (Voice commands) - Voice commands are a *feature* of some translation apps, not the method for offline translation.
*   **D: Switirhisiwa eka xiyenge xo hundzuluxela marito hi ku kongoma** (Using a section to translate words by tapping) – This describes a functionality *within* a translation app, not how it works offline.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi nga vangeliki ku wa ka gamboko?,"The correct answer is **B: Vanhu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...minkarhi yo tala i **munhu**."" which translates to ""...many times it is **people**.""  This directly links people to the reason for gamboko falling.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gamboko leyi tiyeke (Broken gamboko):** While the text mentions gamboko needing to be turned to prevent breaking, it doesn't state *broken* gamboko are the cause of them falling.
*   **C: Ku tlhava ka dyambu (The appearance of spots):** The text mentions spots *can* happen when retrieving the gamboko, but doesn't link them to causing it to fall.
*   **D: Gamboko leyi engetelekeke (Gamboko that are added):** This isn’t mentioned in the text.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi waka tanihi kuwa ka gamboko?","The correct answer is **A: Gamboko yo tiya leyi nga khweziwangiki** (A gamble that doesn't exist/is unplayed).

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where a gamble is desired, but a specific, existing gamble isn't available. It says the place *could* offer measured gambles, but this particular one isn't present.  The passage emphasizes the *lack* of a specific gamble.  Therefore, the answer that best reflects this is a gamble that isn't being played or doesn't exist.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Rigiyagiya leri nga riki na gamboko** (A game without a gamble) - The passage is *about* wanting a gamble, not a game without one.
* **C: Gamboko leyi engetelekeke erigiyagiyeni** (A gamble incorporated into the game) -  The passage doesn’t talk about integrating a gamble *into* a game, just the absence of the desired gamble itself.
* **D: Gamboko leyi nga khumbiwangiki hi vanhu** (A gamble not remembered by people) - The passage doesn't mention memory or historical relevance. It's about current unavailability.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, kheri yi endliwa hi swilo swihi?","The correct answer is **B: Mintsembyana ni swipayisisi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""P: Kheri i swakudya leswi endliwaka hi nyama kumbe matsavu naswona swi cheriwa swipayisisi ni mintsembyana."" This directly translates to ""Kheri is a dish made with meat or vegetables and is eaten with rice and lentils."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yogati ni mati** - While yogurt is used in some regions, it's for *cooking* kheri, not what it's made *of*.
*   **C: Ntswamba wa khokhonati na nyama** - Coconut milk is used in some areas, but the core ingredients are still meat/vegetables, rice and lentils.
*   **D: Matsavu ni ntswamba** - Vegetables and coconut milk are components, but not the defining ingredients mentioned as being eaten *with* kheri.



"
"Eka tindhawu tin’wana, ntswamba wa khokhonati wu pfa wu tirhiseriwa nchumu wihi eka kheri?","The correct answer is **B: Matsavu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...edzongeni wa Indiya ni le swifundzeni swin’wana vona va tala ku tirhisa ntswamba wa khokhonati."" (In some parts of India and other regions, they mostly use coconut milk.) and earlier mentions kheri is made with meat or **matsavu** (vegetables). Therefore, coconut milk is used with vegetables when making kheri in those regions.



"
Hikwalaho ka yini ndlela yi fanele ku rhendzeleka Tintshava Ta Transantarctic ku fika erivaleni leri tlakukeke?,"The correct answer is **B: Gamboko leyi manyaneke yi ni khombo**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Gamboko ya yona leyi manyaneke yi thlela yi pandzeka leyi hoxiweke mijeko."" This translates to ""Its large slopes rise and fall, formed by cracks.""  These cracks (or crevasses) are dangerous and require navigation through the Transantarctic Mountains to reach a stable route.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: McMurdo Station hakanyingi ku va ku pfariwile** (McMurdo Station is often snowed in) - While this might be true, it doesn't explain *why* the route needs to follow the Transantarctic Mountains.
* **C: Titeretere leti endliweke hi ndlela yo hlawuleka ta nonoka** (The well-made sleds are slow) -  The speed of the sleds isn't relevant to the route selection.
* **D: Swa antswa ku tlula ku famba hi Ross Sea** (It is difficult to travel by Ross Sea) - The passage describes a *land* traverse, not a sea route.



"
"Ku longoloka na South Pole Traverse, i yini leswi funghiweke hi mijeko?","The correct answer is **B: Titeretere leti fambisaka mafurha** (Sleds carrying fuel and supplies).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...fambiwa ntsena hi ti teretere leti endliweke hi ndlela yo hlawuleka, ti na swilo swa ku rhwala ndzhwalo wa mafurha na mpahla."" This translates to ""...travel is done with specially made sleds, which carry fuel and supplies.""  The passage specifically mentions that the ""gamboko leyi manyaneke leyi thlela yi pandzeka"" (massive, undulating ridge) is formed *by* these sleds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ntila wa le McMurdo Station** (The road from McMurdo Station) - The passage mentions the starting point, but doesn't say the road itself is built by sleds.
*   **C: Mabakwa lama taleke gamboko** (Collapsed ridge structures) - These are a *result* of the traverse, not what builds the ridge.
*   **D: Minjhiko ya khombo entshaveni** (Tracks of ships in the ice) - Ships aren't involved in this land traverse.



"
I yini lexi nga boxiwangiki eka xiyenge lexi vapfhumba va faneleke va pfa va xi lemuka loko va valanga eDzongeni wa Afrika?,"The correct answer is **A: Matiko yo hambana ma ni swilaveko leswi nga faniki swa Tivhisa** (Different countries have different visa requirements).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Swilaveko swa vhisa ni timali ta kona swi titshege hi tiko naswona swi susumetiwa hi tiko leri u humaka eka rona."" (Visa and currency requirements differ by country and are advised based on your country of origin.) This is the key piece of information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku valanga hi movha i ndlela leyinene etindleleni leti fambelaka etlhelo:** The passage discusses vehicle type (4x4) and road conditions, but doesn’t say driving on main roads is prohibited.
* **C: Matiko yo tala lama akelaneke eDzongeni wa Afrika ma ni ntshamiseko:** The passage doesn’t mention anything about unrest in countries surrounding South Africa.
* **D: Ku bumabumeriwa 4x4 loko u famba hi movha:** The passage *recommends* 4x4, but doesn’t say it’s mandatory.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga tekiwaka xi ri xi xitsundzuxo xo biha eka vapfhumba loko lavaka ku valanga Dzonga wa Afrika hi movha?","The correct answer is **A: Swilo swin’wana swa xilamulela mhangu swa boha hi nawu ku va na swona emovheni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tiko rin’wana ni rin’wana ri na milawu yo hlawuleka leyi vulaka leswi u nga swi rhwalaka emovheni swa xilamulela mhangu."" This directly translates to ""Each country has different payment laws that you should check for in border crossing vehicles."" This implies that there are customs/import duties/fees that need to be paid when crossing borders with a vehicle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the passage mentions 4x4s, it doesn't say they are *required* for most areas, only that they are recommended or make access easier.
* **C:** The passage doesn't focus on the ease of travel for people generally, but on border crossing specifics.
* **D:** The passage mentions other countries near South Africa, but doesn’t imply they are difficult to enter. It focuses on the need to check visa and financial requirements *for each country*.

Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi boxiweke eka xiyenge lexi tanihi khombo loko u siya mindzhwalo ya wena yi nga ri na munhu?,"The correct answer is **D: Valawuri va nga ha yi languti tanihi nxungeto wa bomo** (Law enforcement might treat it as a threat to life).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Matiko man’wana ma ni milawu ya nsele yo xupula vanhu hambi lava va endlaka milandzu ro sungula; yi katsa malembe ya 10 ejele kumbe rifu."" (Some countries have strict laws to punish people who commit crimes first; including 10 years in prison or death). This directly relates to the serious consequences of carrying weapons illegally.
* The passage warns about the dangers of carrying weapons (""Tshama u veke mindzhwalo ya wena...ngopfungopfu..."") and how it can lead to being falsely accused and put in danger.  This makes it a life-threatening situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yi nga ha yiviwa (It might be ignored):** The passage clearly indicates the opposite - there are serious legal consequences.
* **B: U nga ha tikuma u rhwala swidzidzirisi u nga swi tivi (You might be framed for teaching others without knowing):** While the passage mentions being falsely accused, the primary focus is on the illegality and danger of carrying a weapon.
* **C: Yi nga ha langutiwa onge i ya munhu u n’wana (It might be dismissed as belonging to a child):** This is irrelevant to the context and the serious consequences discussed.



"
I yini lexi nga boxiwiki eka xiyenge lexi malunghana ni ku famba ni xidzidzirisi?,"The correct answer is **C: Timbyana leti nun’hwetelaka swidzidzirisi ti nga ha tirhisi handle ko tivisiwa.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""U nga ha tikuma u tirhisiwa ku ngungumerisa swidzidzirisi swa vanhu van’wana u nga swi tivi ivi swi ku nghenisa enghozini... hikuva timbyana to nun'hwetela ti nga vitaniwa nkarhi wun’wana ni wun’wana handle ka xitiviso.""  This directly translates to ""You may not be allowed to use other people's qualifications if you don't have them, putting you in danger... because certificates can be used anytime without verification.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage mentions the death penalty in *some* countries for forgery, it's not the central point about traveling with qualifications.
* **B:** The passage warns about dangers, but doesn't specifically focus on needing extreme caution when traveling to foreign countries.
* **D:** The passage mentions police potentially ignoring suspicious certificates, not necessarily taking your details if you don't have qualifications.



"
I xonwa xihi lexi nga boxiwangiki lexi u nga ringeta ku xi endla ekaya loko u wisile?,"The correct answer is **B: Kofi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions ""tikofi to hambanahambana"" (different types of coffee) and how you can enjoy them when you have time. It also talks about experimenting with coffee and mixing it with other things.  The passage even starts by mentioning ""Nimixo n’wana cofi"" (a little coffee).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Juzi (Juice):** While the passage mentions finding interesting drinks, it doesn't focus on juice specifically.
* **C: Byala (Beer):** The passage doesn't mention beer at all.
* **D: Tiya (Tea):** While tea is a drink, the passage's primary focus is on coffee.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi kwihi laha u fanele ku endzela kona loko u endzela ndhawu laha u tshamaka kona ku ya nwa swonwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Switolo swa kofi ekulenyana ni laha u tshamaka kona**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Loko u vhakela tindhawu ta laha u tshamaka kona u va ni nkarhi wo ringeta tikofi to hambanahambana.""  This translates to: ""When you visit places where you sit, you should have time to drink different coffees.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Switolo swa juzi kumbe smoothie:** The text mentions juices made with different hands (ingredients) but not specifically as a replacement for coffee when sitting.
* **C: Tibarha leti u nga titolovelangiki:** This refers to items you can't tolerate and doesn't relate to finding a place to enjoy a drink.
* **D: Tirhesiturente leti endlaka tiya ya chamomile:** This is about chamomile tea, which isn't mentioned in the context of a coffee break while relaxing.



"
Xana swifaniso swa matuva swi kumeka kwihi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ejarateni ra kereke** (At the churchyard).

The passage states: ""Eka jarata ra kereke, ku na swifaniso swo tsakisa swa matuva..."" which directly translates to ""At the churchyard, there are interesting depictions of skulls..."".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nkarhi wa hafu ya awara ku suka emutini** (Half an hour's walk from town) - The passage mentions this as a travel time *to* the place, not where the skulls are.
*   **C: Exihaleni xa Eysturoy** (On the island of Eysturoy) - This is where Haldarsvík *is*, but not specifically where the skulls are located.
*   **D: Endzeni ka kereke** (Inside the church) - The passage doesn't mention the skulls being *inside* the church.



"
Hi wihi muxaka wa vhisa lowu nga ha lavaka leswaku munhu a nyika vumbhoni bya leswaku u ni mali leri ringaneke?,"The correct answer is **D: Vhisa ya xichudeni (Student Visa)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Ku toloveleke leswaku tivhisa ta vadyondzi ti va na swilaveko swo hambana... na vumbhoni bya mali leyi yi nga ta ku hlayisa eka lembe ro sungula ra tidyondzo ta wena."" (It is important that student visas have different requirements... and proof of funds to support your first year of study.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vhisa ya bindzu (Work Visa):**  The passage discusses studying, not working.
* **B: Vhisa ya muendzi (Tourist Visa):** Tourist visas are for short visits and don't require proof of funds for extended stays like education.
* **C: Vhisa ya nkarhinyana (Short-term Visa):** Similar to a tourist visa, these are short-term and don't relate to the financial proof needed for studying.



"
I mani loyi a nga tshukaka a lava ku va ni vhisa yo leha?,"The correct answer is **A: Muendzi la fambaka ngopfu** (A frequent traveler).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on someone wanting to travel to another country for study (a student) and needing a visa.**  It specifically mentions students needing different visa requirements than ""mupfhumba"" (traditional healers) or ""vanhu va mabindzu"" (people of the bushes/rural areas).
* **""Muendzi la fambaka ngopfu""** directly translates to ""frequent traveler"" and encompasses the idea of someone who needs a long-term visa to repeatedly enter a country, like a student.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mupfhumba la nga ni ntokoto** (A traditional healer without papers) - The passage states traditional healers have *different* visa requirements, not that they are the ones *seeking* a long-term visa.
* **C: Xichudeni xa le ka tiko rimbe** (Someone born in a foreign country) -  This doesn't necessarily require a visa for long-term stays, depending on citizenship laws.
* **D: Muendzi wa ta bindzu** (A rural traveler) - Similar to option B, the passage differentiates between this type of traveler and students needing visas.



"
Hi rini laha ngopfungopfu u fanele ku xiyaxiya tinsuna?,"The correct answer is **A: Hi tin’hweti ta ximumu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngopfu ngopfu eka ximumu..."" which translates to ""Ngopfu ngopfu during the winter...""  It then discusses being careful around crocodiles when near water during this time. Therefore, the passage directly links *ngopfungopfu* (being careful) to the winter months (*tin’hweti ta ximumu*).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Loko u hayika (When you are afraid)** - While caution is good when afraid, the passage specifies a *time* for caution, not a feeling.
*   **C: Ekhwatini (In the river)** - The passage talks about being near water, but doesn't say *ngopfungopfu* is only needed *in* the river.
*   **D: Loko u chayela (When you are driving)** - The passage is about being near water and crocodiles, not driving.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi u faneleke u papalata ku xi endla leswaku u nga karhatiwi hi tinsuna loko u chayela ekhwatini?","The correct answer is **A: Ku tshika tinyangwa ta movha ti pfuriwile nkarhi wo leha** (Always wear a life jacket).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly warns about the danger of crocodiles in rivers.** The phrase ""loko u teke xiboho xa ku khandziya ntshava eka makhwati lama ku tolovelekeke hi mpfula"" means ""when you take the risk of encountering crocodiles in rivers.""
* **The passage also mentions the importance of safety.** The final sentence advises ensuring others don't enter the boat with you.
* **A life jacket is the *primary* safety precaution against drowning if attacked by a crocodile or if the boat capsizes.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku chayela hi ximumu** (Driving in the fog) - While potentially dangerous, fog isn't the primary concern mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Ku chayela etindhawini ta makhwati ya mpfula** (Driving in river areas) -  The passage focuses on the dangers *within* the river, not just being near it.
* **D: Ku siya movha wu nga ri na munhu loko u hayika** (Leaving the boat empty when you get off) - This doesn't address the crocodile danger directly.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Vasundarbans va tshama ehenhla kwa ndhawu yo ringana na 3,850 km², laha n’we xa nharhu ku nga mati kumbe nhangasi."" (Vasundarbans cover an area of approximately 3,850 km², where about half the area is water or land.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku ni makhwati ma nga ri mangani lama saleke:** The passage mentions Sundarbans National Park, indicating there *are* protected areas.
* **C: I ndhawu leyikulu swinene emisaveni ya bandhi ra mangrove:** The passage describes Vasundarban as a large mangrove forest (""hi vona vo tala eka bandhi ra mangrove"").
* **D: Ku ni timhala to tala ku tlula tiyingwe ta le Bengal:** The passage states there are around 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer, meaning there are significantly more deer than tigers.

Hi xihi xiphemu xa khwati lexi nga endhawini ya India?,"The correct answer is **A: Sundarbans National Park**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Tlhelo ra khwati leri welaka etikweni ra Indiya ri vitaniwe Sundarbans National Park"" which translates to ""The area of the forest located in India is known as Sundarbans National Park."" 

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Vuhlayiselo bya swiharhi:** (Population of animals) - While the text mentions animal populations, it doesn't name this as the forest area itself.
* **C: Ndhawu ya Mfumo wa Misava:** (Area of the Kingdom of Forests) - This is not mentioned in the text.
* **D: Rivala ra Gangetic:** (Gangetic Delta) - The text mentions the Gangetic delta *influences* the area, but it isn't the name of the forest area within India.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi a nga tshukaka a nga ri twisisi ngopfu ririmi ra Xinghezi?","The correct answer is **A: Vanhu lava vulavulaka tindzimi tin’wana timbirhi** (People who speak only one or two languages).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Eka matiko yo tala vanhu va kona va xi vulavula kahle Xilungu, kambe u nga kuma leswaku a va na vutivi byo tala ngopfungopfu vanhu lavatsongo.""  This translates to: ""In many countries, people can speak English well, but you will find that they don't have as much understanding of nuances as native speakers.""

This directly implies that those who *don't* have a strong grasp of English (and likely speak only one or two languages, one being their native tongue) would struggle more with understanding complex or nuanced language.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Vanhu lava nga vantshwa hi malembe** (People who are old) - Age isn't directly related to language comprehension in the passage.
*   **C: Vanhu lava endzelaka Toronto** (People who live in Toronto) - The scenario in Toronto is used to illustrate multilingual communication, not to identify those who struggle with English.
*   **D: Vanhu lava kuleke hi malembe** (People who are young) - Similar to age, youth is not directly related to language comprehension in the passage.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga tikaka ku xi vitana?","The correct answer is **C: Marito lama tsariweke**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Minkarhi yo tala swa olova ku twisisa marito lama tsariweke kunene ku tlula lama vuriweke."" This translates to ""Often it is difficult to understand complex sentences more than simple ones.""  The passage then elaborates on how complex sentences can be challenging, even for those fluent in a language.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Marito hikuya hi mavitanelo ya kona yo hlawuleka:** (Sentences based on local customs/beliefs) - While the example *includes* people from different places sharing stories, the passage isn't *about* local customs.
* **B: Tiadirese:** (Addresses) - The passage doesn't focus on addresses.
* **D: Marito lama tikaka ku ma vula ya ndhawu:** (Sentences that are easily understood locally) -  The passage argues the opposite – that complex sentences are *not* easily understood.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xiyimo lexi nga vaka xinene eka mupfhumba loyi a hlelaka ku famba hi bazi ku suka exitichini xa le ndzeni ka xifundzha?","The correct answer is **A: Mupfhumba u ya eJakar naswona se u xava thikithi ka ha ri emahlweni** (The passenger is going to Jakar and already has a ticket).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ngopfu ngopfu lama yaka evuxeni ni le Jakar/Bumthang ya famba exikarhi ka 06:30 na 07:30"" (buses to various places including Jakar/Bumthang run between 6:30 and 7:30). It also mentions needing a ticket (""u xava tikithi"").
* **Option A** directly reflects this information – a passenger going to Jakar and having a ticket.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While Bumthang is mentioned, there's no indication the passenger *specifically* wants to leave at 7.
* **C:** Paro is mentioned as a destination that uses expensive buses, but no information points to a passenger going there or leaving at 11.
* **D:** The passage doesn't mention anyone arriving at the station at 6:20. It focuses on the bus departure times.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...mabazi ya suka eka xitici xa mabazi lama nghena ka eka xifundza (ku tsemakanya nkova), siku hinkwaro, hambileswi wo tala, ngopfu ngopfu lama yaka evuxeni ni le Jakar/Bumthang ya famba exikarhi ka 06:30 na 07:30."" This means buses *arrive* at the district between 6:30 and 7:30.  The passage then mentions needing to buy tickets ""masiku ma nga ri mangani"" suggesting a later departure.  The answer choice stating 8:30 is the closest logical departure time.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Xava thikithi ka ha ri emahlweni:** While ticket prices are mentioned, the passage doesn't specify when they are available.
    * **C: Tibazi to tala ta suka siku hinkwaro:** This is true, but doesn't address the *time* of departure, which is what the question asks.
    * **D: Ku hakelela thekisi yin’we ku nga ha va ndlela leyinene yo famba:** This discusses travel methods to distant locations but doesn't answer the question about departure time from the bus station.

Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki nhlamuselo leyi kongomeke ya Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **C: A yi fikeleleki hi xihahampfhuka**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Timbuktu i doroba leri siwaneke, hambileswi ndhumba ya rona yi ri endla ndhawu ya vapfhumba, naswona yi na rivala ra swihaha mpfuka."" This translates to ""Timbuktu is an inaccessible city, although our legend makes it a place of wonders, and it has a wealth of profound knowledge.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yi ni nkucetelo lowukulu wa vu Arabiwa ku tlula tiko hinkwaro?** (Is it a major center of Arab culture more than any other country?) - While the passage mentions Arab influence, it doesn't claim it's *more* than any other country.
* **B: Yi ni vusweti** (It is sacred) - The passage doesn't indicate anything about Timbuktu being sacred.
* **D: Ya ha tsakeriwa hi vapfhumba lava lavaka ku tiva** (It is sought after by the wise who can understand) - While the passage says it's a place of wonders, it doesn't say it’s actively *sought after* by the wise.



"
Eka timhaka leti landzelaka hi yihi leyi nga ntiyiso hi Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **A: Doroba leri ra fikelelaka hi xihahampfhuka** (The city is known for its abundant wealth).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""...yi na rivala ra swihaha mpfuka"" which translates to ""...it has abundant wealth.""  This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ri xongile ematshan’weni yo va evuswetini** (It is built on the mountains of the west) - The passage doesn't mention mountains or the west.
* **C: Yi hava swilo swa le Afrika ku hambana ni madoroba ya le kusuhi** (It has nothing of Africa compared to nearby cities) - The passage actually says the opposite – it has a mix of Arabic *and* African influences.
* **D: Doroba leri a ra ha koki vapfhumba** (The city cannot accommodate people) - The passage states it's a place of people (""ndhawu ya vapfhumba"") despite being remote.



"
Xana Tiolimpiki ta ximumu xi sungule ku hleriwa rini? ,"The correct answer is **A: August 2021**.

Here's why:

The text states the games were *originally* scheduled to take place from July 2020, but were postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. It then says the games actually took place from **24 to 5 September 2021**.  Since September follows August, and the games started on the 24th, we can infer they began in August.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana moya lowukulu wu hundzuka rini xihuhuri?","The correct answer is **A: Loko mimoya yi fika eka rivilo ra 100 wa timayile hi awara**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that a tornado creates *large winds (sometimes 100-200 miles/hour)*.  It then describes how it forms. This directly links strong wind speeds to the formation of a tornado.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Loko swiyenge swa moya swi sungula ku ndziwika** - While changes in air are *part* of tornado formation, it's the *speed* of the wind that defines it as a tornado.
* **C: Loko wu vangiwa hi mapapa ya xihuhuri** - This describes a characteristic *of* a tornado (the funnel cloud) but isn't the defining moment of *becoming* a tornado.
* **D: Loko wu khumba ehansi** -  Touching down is a stage of a tornado, but the high wind speed is what *makes* it a tornado in the first place.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi fambisanaka ni xihuhuri?,"The correct answer is **A: Swihuhuri swi tshamela ku pfuxa mimoya rivilo ra 100-200 wa timayile hi awara**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ti endla moya lowukulu (nkarhi wun’wana 100-200 ti mayile/awara)..."" (It creates strong winds, sometimes 100-200 miles/hour).  This directly links hurricanes to high wind speeds.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Swi tala ku tlakula swilo swo tika** (It often lifts objects into the air) - While true, this is a *result* of the hurricane, not a defining characteristic that *defines* it.
* **C: Swi va ni xiyimo xa xihuhuri loko swi khumba misava** (It has a hurricane condition when it touches land) - This describes a stage of a hurricane, not what a hurricane *is*.
* **D: I swiyenge leswi rhendzelekaka leswi susumetelaka moya ehandle** (It is a system that encourages air to move outwards) - While hurricanes *do* involve air movement, this description is too vague and doesn't capture the specific, powerful rotating nature of a hurricane.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana mupfhumba a nga xi kuma kwihi xitsundzuxo malunghana ni xiyimo xa politiki xa doroba leri a ri endzelaka?","The correct answer is **C: Eka vaakatiko va tiko leri a nga ta ri endzela** (From the citizens of the country he/she is visiting).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...vaakatiko va Amerika lava tshamaka eMiddle East va nga khomiwa hi tindlela leti nga faniki hi vanhu va leYuropa kumbe Maarabu."" This directly indicates that information regarding the political situation should be sought *from the citizens* of the country in question, as they will have firsthand knowledge and perspectives that outsiders might not.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eka hulumendhe ya tiko leri a nga ta ri endzela** (From the government of the country he/she is visiting) - While governments *have* information, the passage suggests potential bias and differing experiences.
* **B: Eka swibumabumelo swa vatsundzuxi va maendzo** (From travel agency brochures) - Brochures are unlikely to provide nuanced political analysis.
* **D: Eka hulumendhe ya yena** (From his/her own government) -  The passage highlights that perspectives can vary geographically; one's own government might not have the most accurate or complete picture.

"Loko switsundzuxo swa maendzo, xana hi swihi leswi muaki wa tiko rimbe a nga tshukaka a nga langutani na swona?","The correct answer is **B: Ku katsakanyiwa swinene ka xiyimo xa politiki xa tiko ro karhi** (Strong consideration of the political situation of the country in question).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Swilemukiso leswi ko va nkatsakanyo wa xiyimo xa tipolitiki xa tiko ro karhi."" This directly translates to ""These considerations can be a reflection of the political situation of the country.""  The passage emphasizes that political circumstances heavily influence travel advisories and potential risks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndzindzakhombo wo pfuna ku khansela riendzo lowu khumbekaka** (The right to cancel a planned trip) - While the passage *mentions* the possibility of cancellation, it's not the core point of what a country considers when issuing travel advice.
*   **C: Ndzindzakhombo wa rihanyo lowu khumbekaka** (The right to a planned trip) - The passage doesn't focus on rights to travel, but rather the considerations *before* a trip.
*   **D: Vuxokoxoko malunghana ni xiyimo xa politiki xa tiko ro karhi** (Information about the political situation of the country) -  Information is important, but the passage stresses *consideration* of this information when making travel advisories.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i muxaka muni wa riendzo lowu nga tshukaka wu nga lavi ngopfu mpfuno wa ku buma eka muhleri wa maendzo?","The correct answer is **C: Riendzo leri nga ta katsa xiphiqo xa ririmi** (A test that would include a language requirement).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Muhleri wa maendzo wa pfuna loko u lava ku ya etindhawini leti nga faniki hi ndhavuko, ririmi kumbe xiyimo xa ekhonomi xa tindhawu leti a wu yile."" This translates to ""A tour guide needs to be able to go to places that are accessible by culture, language or economic conditions of the areas they visit."" 

Therefore, a strong requirement for a tour guide would be proficiency in language, as it's directly mentioned as a necessary skill to access certain areas and serve tourists effectively.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A:** While experience is valuable, the passage doesn't prioritize it as a *requirement*.
* **B:** A two-week trial period with cost implications is a logistical detail, not a core skill requirement.
* **D:** A trial run starting with the guide is a method of assessment, not a fundamental qualification.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Muhleri wa maendzo wa pfuna loko u lava ku ya etindhawini leti nga faniki hi ndhavuko, ririmi kumbe xiyimo xa ekhonomi xa tindhawu leti a wu yile.""  This translates to: ""A travel agent benefits when you want to go to places distinguished by culture, language, or the economic conditions of the areas you visit.""

This directly supports option D, as being interested in the culture of a place (mindhavuko) is a key factor a good travel agent would cater to and benefit from.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While enjoyment is important, the passage doesn’t emphasize this as a primary benefit for the agent.
*   **B:**  Looking for cheap deals isn't specifically mentioned as a focus of the travel agent's expertise.
*   **C:** Language skills are mentioned as a characteristic *of the place* being visited, not necessarily something the agent caters to for the traveler.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga pfunaka muendzi ku papalata ku khomiwa hi tingana loko a endzela tindhawu letintshwa?","The correct answer is **A: Ku langutela leswaku swilo swi fana ni le kaya** (Expecting things to be the same as home).

Here's why:

The passage *specifically warns against* expecting things to be the same as home. It states: ""Loko u endza, u nga languteli leswaku swilo swi ta fana ni le kaya.""  This expectation is presented as something that will lead to problems and discomfort.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku tiyimisela ku ringeta swakudya leswi nga tolovelekangiki** (Insisting on eating disliked food) - The passage doesn't mention this.
* **C: Ku landzela milawu yo fana ni ya le kaya** (Following the same laws as at home) - The passage *highlights* that laws will be different, so following home laws would be a mistake.
* **D: Ku papalata ku rhanga hi ku endla ndzavisiso hi byetlelo** (Being eager to learn about customs) - While being open to learning is good, the passage directly identifies the *problem* as expecting things to be the same, not a lack of willingness to learn.



"
"Hi ku landza rungula leri nga eka xiyenge lexi, i munhu wa muxaka muni loyi a nga ha khomiwaka hi tingana loko a endzela tiko rimbe?","The correct answer is **B: Munhu loyi a tsakelaka ku cinca ka swilo (A person who dislikes change)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of being adaptable and understanding that things will be *different* in a new place – customs, food, language, etc.  Someone who *dislikes change* would struggle immensely with this and be prone to being unhappy or offending people because they expect everything to be the same as home.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Munhu loyi a rhandzaka swakudya swa vulovolovo (A person who likes exotic food):**  While being open to new foods is helpful, it's not the core issue the passage addresses.  The passage is about broader cultural adaptation.
* **C: Munhu loyi a pfumalaka mianakanyo yo pfuleka (A person who makes hasty judgments):**  This could be a problem, but the passage specifically focuses on *expecting* things to be the same, not necessarily judging quickly.
* **D: Munhu loyi a tsakelaka ku dyondza (A person who likes to learn):**  Someone who likes to learn would likely *benefit* from experiencing a new culture, rather than struggle with it.

Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki xitsundzuxo lexi bumabumeriwaka eka vaendzi lava sungula ku endzela tiko leri ra ha hluvukaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku rhanga hi ku tiva swimila swa ndhawu u nga si endlela ehansi** (It is important to learn the customs of the place so you don't embarrass yourself).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes adapting to different customs.** It specifically mentions people getting into trouble because they do things differently than expected (""va karhatekile loko va fika eka matiko lama ha hluvukaka, laha a ku laveka leswaku va endla swilo hi ndlela leyi hambaneke"").  Learning the local customs helps avoid this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku papalata ku dya ngopfu eka masiku yo sungula** (Eating a lot in the first few days) - The passage warns against eating unfamiliar food that might make you sick.
* **C: Xiponci ni sangu i swinene loko u ta ndzima tendze** (A hat and shoes are important when you walk far) - The passage mentions protection from snakes and insects, not just walking far.
* **D: Hakelela hotela ya xiyimo lexinene loko wa ha ku fika** (Book a very comfortable hotel when you arrive) - While comfortable lodging is nice, the passage focuses on *adapting* to the new environment, not just staying in luxury.

The passage states: ""Loko wa ha ku fika ringeta ku hanya vutomi bya le xilungwini kumbe u ya etihotela ta xiyimo, u dya swakudya leswi u swi tivaka leswaku u ta hatla u tolovela."" This directly translates to ""When you arrive, you might try to live like the locals or go to suitable hotels, and eat food that you know will make you sick so you can adapt.""  This describes trying local cuisine (vukorhokeri bya xiyimo) even if it might cause discomfort, as a way to adjust to the new environment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Swakudya swa muxaka wa Xilungu:** The passage doesn't mention English food. It focuses on local food.
* **C: Matirasi kumbe xiponci loko u dzima tende:** This refers to bedding or a safety net for sleeping, not something you *consume* to adapt.
* **D: Tihotela ta xiyimo:** Hotels are a place to stay, not something you eat.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Loko u famba ni Laptop kumbe tablet seyivha kopi ya wena eka swona kumbe u va na disk (u ta kota ku yi kuma hambi u nga ri na inthanete).""  This directly addresses the scenario of someone without internet access needing a copy of their policy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku nyika kopi eka munghana loyi u fambaka na yena:** While mentioned, this isn't the *primary* solution for someone needing access *without* internet. It relies on another person being present.
* **B: Ku tirhumelela kopi hi imeyili:** The text explicitly says this requires internet (""hi ku tiimeyilela yona"").
* **D: Ku hlayisa kopi eka “cloud”:** This *also* requires internet access.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the need to provide ""imemaili adirese ya ndzindzakhombo"" (the institution's email address) and phone numbers for international calls to facilitate requests or further assistance.  This is information the policy should clearly state how to access.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Tinambara to kota ku fonela ematikweni ya le handle (Phone numbers to call international countries)** - While mentioned, the passage states these are *for contacting the institution*, not something that needs to be *on* the policy itself.  It's a contact method *using* the policy information.
* **C: Tinambara ta matiko ya le handle to kuma mpfumelelo (International country numbers to get approval)** - This isn't mentioned in the passage at all.
* **D: Adirese ya imeyili ya n’wini wa pholisi (The policyholder's email address)** - The passage focuses on providing the *institution's* contact details, not the policyholder's.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi wihi mpimo wa negative lowu kombisa muxaka wa filimi lowu tirhisaka ngopfu?","The correct answer is **D: 36 x 24 mm negative**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Filimi leyi tolovelekeke ya 35 mm (36 x 24 mm negative) hi yona leyi tolovelekeke."" This directly identifies the 36 x 24 mm negative as the most commonly used format. While the 6x6 and 56x56mm are mentioned as formats used by some cameras, they are not the *most* commonly used.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi wihi muxaka wa filimi lowu nga ni resolution leyi fanaka na DSLR?,"The correct answer is **C: Filimi ya 56 x 56 mm**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tikhemera tin’wana ta filimi ya muxaka wa kahle ti tirhisa muxaka wa 6 x 6 cm, leyi hi ku kongoma ku nga 56 x 56 mm negative. Ti va ni resolution leyi andzisiweke ka mune ya 35 mm negative….""  It directly links the 56x56mm film to having increased resolution compared to 35mm and implies it’s closer to DSLR resolution.
* **The passage also states:** ""Filimi leyi tolovelekeke ya 35 mm… yi ni resolution leyi ringanakanyana ni leya sweswi ya DSLR."" meaning 35mm has *lower* resolution than a DSLR.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Filimi ya 35 mm** - The passage says this has *lower* resolution than a DSLR.
* **B: Filimi ya muxaka lowu tolovelekeke** - This is too vague; the passage focuses on specific sizes.
* **D: Filimi ya 6 x 6 cm** - While equivalent to the 56x56mm film, 56x56mm is the specific dimension mentioned as having increased resolution.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi hi rihi goza ro hetelela eku sunguleni bindzu ro tsala hi swa vufambi?","The correct answer is **A: Ku titoloveta matsalelo eka webusayiti** (Collecting data on a website).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Endzhaku ka loko u kota matsalelo ni ku lunghisa matsalelo eka webusayiti..."" (Once you can collect and analyze data on a website...). This directly links collecting data as a *prerequisite* to starting a travel blog.  You need data to understand what people are searching for and what content is successful.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While writing articles is *part* of blogging, it's not the first step mentioned.
* **C:** Creating your own website comes *after* you can collect and analyze data.
* **D:** Improving your skills is good, but the passage doesn't position it as the *initial* step.

"Loko u sungula bindzu ro tsala hi swa vufambi, eka vuswikoti lebyi landzelaka hi byihi lebyi faneleke ku rhanga byi lotiwa?","The correct answer is **A: Ku buloga** (To blog).

Here's why:

The passage states that starting a travel blog (""bindzu ro tsala hi swa vufambi"") is a way to utilize your skills on a travel-related website.  ""Ku buloga"" directly translates to blogging, which is the core activity of creating content on a website focused on travel experiences.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ku lulamisa webusayiti** (To fix a website) - While important, it's not the *starting point* of a travel blog.
* **C: Ku lunghisa matsalelo** (To edit posts) -  This is a step *within* blogging, not the initiation of it.
* **D: Ku endla webusayiti** (To create a website) - The passage implies you're using an *existing* travel website initially, not building one from scratch.  Creating your own website comes *after* you've gained experience.

Here's why:

The passage describes illnesses (""Delhi Belly,"" etc.) caused by contaminated food and water, often linked to unsanitary conditions.  These conditions thrive in warm, moist environments where bacteria multiply rapidly.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eka maxelo yo titimela** (In moist environments) - While moisture is important, *warmth* is also crucial for bacterial growth.
* **C: Maxelo yo hisa** (Warm environments) -  Moisture is also needed.
* **D: Maxelo yo oma** (Dry environments) - Bacteria generally don't thrive in dry conditions.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana u nga sawutiseka hi ku tshamela ku langutana ni xiyimo xihi?","The correct answer is **B: Switsongwatsongwana swa ndhawu**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically discusses getting sick from encountering **switsongwatsongwana (germs/bacteria)**, especially when traveling to different places (**etindhawini tin’wana**). It mentions illnesses like Delhi Belly, Pharaoh's Curse, and Montezuma's Revenge, all caused by local germs. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Swiphiqo swa le khwiri (Food poisoning):** While food poisoning *can* be caused by germs, the passage focuses on the germs themselves, not just the resulting food poisoning.
* **C: Swiphiqo swo hefemula (Viral infections):** The passage doesn't specifically mention viruses.
* **D: Ntungu wa Delhi Belly (Delhi Belly):** This is an *example* of an illness caused by the problem, not the problem itself. The passage is talking about the general risk of getting sick from unfamiliar germs.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi pfunaka loko u famba endhawini ya Schengen?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku hlayisa mali** (Spending money).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...loko u ri na visa ya le Schengen, a swi bohi leswaku u endla xikombelo xa ti visa ta matiko hinkwawo lama nga ni vuxaka ni ra Schengen, kutani sweswo swi endla leswaku u hlayisa nkarhi ni mali ya wena...""  This translates to ""...if you have a Schengen visa, it is not necessary to apply for visas for all countries not associated with Schengen, but this means you save time and **money**...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku papalata ku endla swikombo swo hlaya swa vhisa** (It's easy to make visa applications) - The passage actually states the opposite - having a Schengen visa *reduces* the need for multiple visa applications.
*   **C: Ku papalata tindhawu to hlaya to lawula phasipoto** (It's easy to find passport control points) - The passage doesn't mention the ease of finding passport control.
*   **D: Ku hava xilaveko xa phasipoto** (No passport needed) - This is incorrect; a passport is always required for international travel.

I yini lexi nga ha kumekiki esirheni ra Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **C: Makatla ya ntsumbu (Legs of the mummy)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...loko ribye ra vuhosi ra Tutankhamun ri pimanisiwa na man’wana a swi talanga swilo leswi u nga swi vonaka loko u vhaka hikuva i rintsongo naswona a ri khavisiwangi ngopfu. Munhu wun’wana ni wun’wana loyi a tsakelaka ku vona vumbhoni bya ku onhaka ka mummy hi nkarhi loyi a ku ringanyetiwa ku yi susa eka bokisi u ta dzana hikuva ku vonaka nhloko na makatla ntsena.""

This translates to: ""...compared to other royal tombs, it lacked things you wouldn’t expect to see because it was small and not very well furnished. Anyone who wants to see evidence of the mummification would be disappointed to find only the head and legs visible.""

Therefore, the legs of the mummy are mentioned as being visible, meaning they *were* found in the tomb. The passage implies other parts (like a complete body, or riches) were *missing*.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Swikhaviso swin’wana (Other possessions):** The passage specifically states the tomb was *not* well-furnished, meaning many possessions were missing.
*   **B: Nhloko ya ntsumbu (Head of the mummy):** The passage says the head *was* visible.
*   **D: Rifuwo (Furniture):** The passage mentions the tomb wasn't well-furnished.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi yihi ndhawu ya Vancouver leyi nga tshukaka yi nga tsakeriwi hi vaendzi lava xiyisisaka mitsengo? ","The correct answer is **C: Bowen Island**.

Here's why:

The passage states Bowen Island is a place people visit for day trips or weekend getaways, and it's described as having many activities. It implies it's a more accessible and potentially less expensive option compared to Whistler. Whistler is described as being 1.5 hours away and hosting large, expensive events (Olympics), suggesting it's likely more costly.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Granville Island:** The passage mentions taking ferries *from* Granville Island to Bowen Island, so it's a starting point, not the destination being described as affordable.
*   **B: Sea to Sky:** This isn't mentioned as a specific destination, but is generally the route to Whistler.
*   **D: Whistler:** The passage implies Whistler is *more* expensive, due to its popularity and hosting of the Olympics.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi yihi ndhawu leyi nga tshukaka yi nyika ngopfu vaendzi ntokoto wa xiviri wa le Vancouver?","The correct answer is **A: Bowen Island**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states Bowen Island is a place people visit for day trips or weekend getaways, offering activities like kayaking and hiking. It's described as a popular destination *from* Vancouver for those who enjoy outdoor activities and a less strenuous hike. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Whistler:** While popular, the text describes it as a more distant and potentially difficult trip (1.5 hours driving) and focuses on its winter sports appeal.
* **C: Downtown Vancouver:** The text mentions Granville Island *in* Vancouver, but doesn’t position downtown Vancouver itself as a nature destination for day trips.
* **D: Granville Island:** It's a transport hub *to* Bowen Island, not the destination itself.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi rini laha vaendzi va faneleke ku endzela mahovohovo loko va lava ku vona khwatsi?","The correct answer is **D: Ehandle ka nguva ya mpfula**.

Here's why:

The text states that during the rainy season (November to March), the water levels are very high and the spray from the falls is intense, *making it difficult to see the falls clearly – covered in water!*  Therefore, to see the falls properly, you need to visit *outside* of the rainy season.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: November ku ya eka March:** This is the *worst* time to see the falls clearly.
* **B: Hi nkarhi wo rhandziwa hi vaendzi:** The text doesn't specifically say when it's most popular, only that it attracts many people.
* **C: Loko mati ma tele:**  When the water is high, you *can't* see the falls.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi swihi leswi nga swinene hi ku endzela Victoria Falls exikarhi ka November na March?","The correct answer is **D: Ku papalata nguva ya mpfula** (To experience the rainy season).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Hi nguva ya mpfula (November kuya eka March), mpimo wa mati wu va wu ye ehenhla naswona mahovohovo ma ta wisa mati hi ndlela yo tsakisa."" (During the rainy season (November to March), the water level is very high and the waterfalls spray water intensely.) 

While the passage mentions other things, the central point about November-March is the *rainy season* and its impact on the Falls.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: U kota ku vona mahovohovo handle ko siveriwa** (You can see the waterfalls without getting wet) - The passage says the opposite - you *will* get wet!
*   **B: Ku va ni vaendzi lava nga nyawuriki** (There are many tourists) - While it says it's a popular place, it doesn't specifically connect this to November-March.
*   **C: Ku vona vuxongi lebyi hlamarisaka bya ti-Fall** (To see the beauty of the Falls) - The Falls are beautiful year-round, so this isn't specific to November-March.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi nga bumabumeriwiki loko u tirhisa drone?","The correct answer is **A: Ku kamba ka ha ri emahlweni leswi u pfumeleriweke ku teka filimi ya swona** (To ask beforehand what you are allowed to film).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: **""Loko u tirhisa drone, languta ka ha ri nkarhi leswaku i yini leswi u pfumeleriweke ku swifilima...""** (When using a drone, ask beforehand what you are allowed to film...).  This directly addresses the need to find out what is permissible before filming.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku kuma layisense leyi engetelekeke** (To get an extended license) - The passage mentions needing *some* permission or a license, but doesn't specify it needs to be ""extended."" It's about understanding the rules, not necessarily a special license.
* **C: Ku lavisisa hi mapapila ya mpfumelelo** (To inquire about permission papers) - While related to getting permission, the primary step is *asking* what you're allowed to film *before* worrying about the paperwork.
* **D: Ku teka filimi etindhawini leti teleke ntsena laha drone a yi voniwiki** (To film in very remote areas where the drone isn't visible) - The passage actually warns against flying near sensitive areas and emphasizes the importance of being compliant with the law, not avoiding detection.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi tihi tindhawu letinene to teka filimi hi ku tirhisa drone?","The correct answer is **A: Ekusuhi ni mintshungu leyi nga taka yi nga karhatiwi hi vukona bya drone** (Near areas that are not affected by the drone's range).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ku hahisa drone kusuhi na xitixi xa swihaha mpfhuka kumbe eka ntshungu ku tshama ku vonelo ro biha..."" (Flying a drone near animal habitats or mountains is dangerous...). This means avoiding those areas is crucial. The passage also mentions being mindful of drone range.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Eka tindhawu laha ku teka swifaniso ku nga amukeriwiki** (In areas where taking pictures is not allowed) - While true in general, the passage doesn't focus on *general* photography restrictions, but specifically drone-related ones.
* **C: Eka tindhawu ta mphesamphesa laha drone yi nga vonakiki kahle** (In open areas where the drone cannot be seen clearly) - This isn't a safety or legal concern discussed in the passage.
* **D: Eka tindhawu laha u kumeke mimpfumelelo ka ha ri emahlweni** (In areas where you obtain permits in advance) - While permits *might* be needed (as the passage mentions needing permission/licenses), it doesn't identify this as a *preferred* location to fly.



"
"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xivulwa lexi nga riki ntiyiso malunghana ni xilaveko xo tsarisa eka endlelo ra vhisa?","The correct answer is **A: Loko u tshama eka byetlelo bya muendzi, u nga ha tshuka u nga boheki ku tsarisa.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Eswiyinweni swinwana, lava nga tshamiki endhawini ya vaendzi va boheka ku tsarisa. Vutisa ka ha ri nkarhi hikuva nawu lowu a wu tiveki etindhawini tin’wana."" This directly translates to ""Sometimes, people staying in tourist areas can avoid registration. Check as this is not valid everywhere.""  This means registration isn't *always* required for tourists.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Matiko hinkwawo ma lava ku tsarisa ni valawuri va ndhawu** - The passage says registration is required in *some* countries, not all.
* **C: Ku nga ha laveka ku endzela tihofisi ta vapfhumba** - The passage mentions this as *a way* to register, but doesn't state it's a universal requirement.
* **D: Eka tindhawu tin’wana, tihotela ta ndhawu ta tsarisa** - The passage suggests this *can* happen, but as an exception, not a rule.



"
Eka leti landzelaka hi yihi ndhawu leyi muendzi a nga taka a nga yi eka yona ku ya tsarisa?,"The correct answer is **D: Tihofisi ta vapfhumba (Immigration offices)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Leswi swi nga lava ku tata fomo emaphoriseni ya kwalaho kumbe u endzela **etihofisini ta vapfhumba**."" (This may require completing forms at local police stations or going to **immigration offices**).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Xitichi xa maphorisa endhawini yoleyo (Local police station)** - While the passage mentions police stations, it says you *might* complete forms there, but the primary place to *register* is immigration offices.
*   **B: Hotela leyi a tshamaka eka yona (Hotel where they are staying)** - Hotels are mentioned as a place where tourists might be able to register, but it's not the standard or reliable place.
*   **C: Hofisi ya poso ya ndhawu (Local post office)** - Post offices are not mentioned in the passage as a registration point.



"
I mani loyi a nga taka a nga vuyeriwi hi ku tinyikela hi ku tirhandzela loko a ri karhi a famba?,"The correct answer is **C: Munhu loyi a nga ni ntshembo wo kuma vuswikoti lebyintshwa** (A person who doesn't have the desire to gain new experiences).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the benefits of travel:** gaining knowledge, meeting people, learning about different cultures, and broadening one's perspective – all leading to *vuswikoti lebyintshwa* (new insights/experiences).
* **The question asks who wouldn't benefit from travel.** Someone who *doesn't* want new experiences would essentially miss out on all the positive aspects of travel outlined in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Munhu loyi a nga ni ntshembo wo kuma vanghana lavantshwa loko a ri entsungeni** (A person who doesn't have the ability to make friends when they are away) - While this might make travel less enjoyable, it doesn't negate the potential for learning and growth.
* **B: Munhu loyi a lavaka muholo wo nyawula** (A person who wants a high salary) -  The passage *mentions* potentially lower pay for travel jobs, but doesn't suggest someone wanting a high salary wouldn't travel. They might just need to budget carefully.
* **D: Munhu loyi a nga tsakelaka ku ku tirha ivi a hakeriwa hi ku nyikiwa byetlelo** (A person who doesn't like working but is motivated by benefits) - The passage focuses on the intrinsic rewards of travel, not being motivated solely by perks.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana ku tinyikela hi ku tirhandzela loko a ri entsungeni swi nga n’wi vuyerisa njhani muendzi loyi a landzelaka bajete?","The correct answer is **D: Swi nga ku pfuna ku twisisa xiyimo hi ku angarhela.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the benefits of working abroad despite potentially lower pay.** It highlights the value of cultural understanding, meeting new people, learning, and gaining new perspectives. These experiences contribute to a broader understanding of the world (""ku twisisa xiyimo"") gained through hardship (""ku angarhela"" - enduring difficulties/lower pay).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Muholo wa nyikeriwa nkarhi hinkwawo (Salary is always given):** The passage specifically mentions that some jobs offer small salaries.
* **B: Hakanyingi swi pfula tindlela to kuma ntirho (It often opens ways to find work):** While it *could* lead to more opportunities, the passage focuses on the *value* of the experience itself, not simply finding more work.
* **C: Ku pfa ku nyikeriwa ntirho wo hakeriwa hi ku nyikiwa byetlelo (It is common to be given menial work with benefits):** The passage doesn’t specify the *type* of work, just that some jobs have benefits despite low pay.



Therefore, **D** best captures the central idea of the passage: that enduring financial hardship for the sake of experience can lead to valuable personal growth and understanding."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga langutiwaka tanihi xitsundzuxo lexi tolovelekeke ku ya le Walt Disney World?","The correct answer is **C: Ku heta riendzo hinkwaro eka muako wa le Disney** (Spending the entire trip within the Disney grounds).

Here's why:

The passage states the ""beloved"" trip involves ""...*ku heta kwalomu ka vhiki u nga si huma eka miako ya Disney*..."" which translates to ""...spending the whole week without leaving the Disney grounds..."".  This is the core element described as part of the typical, almost expected, Disney World experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku heta vhiki u ri karhi u valanga tiphaki** (Spending the week while constantly waiting in lines) - While lines are part of Disney, the passage doesn't present *waiting in lines* as the defining characteristic of the beloved experience.
*   **B: Ku tshama ehoteleni ya le tlhelo** (Staying at a luxurious hotel) - The passage doesn't specify the *type* of hotel, only that you stay at a Disney hotel.
*   **D: Ku famba hi bazi ku suka erivaleni ra swihahampfhuka ku ya ehoteleni** (Taking a bus from the airport to the hotel) - This is just a logistical detail of getting there, not the core of the ""beloved"" experience.



"
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki ntiyiso hi Walt Disney World?,"The correct answer is **A: Mathikithi yo tirhisiwa katsongo ephakini ma nga hundziseriwa eka vaendzi van’wana**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""mathikithi a ya hundziseriwi"" (tickets are not transferable). This directly contradicts option A, which suggests tickets *can* be used and resold.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **B: Ku kumeka byetlelo endhawini leyi** - The passage describes a full Disney experience including hotels and parks, implying attractions are available.
*   **C: Ku ni tibazi to tleketla vaendzi ku suka erivaleni ra swihahampfhuka ku ya eka muako** - The text mentions buses transporting guests from the airport and to/from Disney hotels.
*   **D: Mathikithi yo masiku yo hlaya ma kumeka eka tiwebusayiti ta ti okixini** - The passage specifically states discounted tickets are found on sites like eBay or Craigslist.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka timhaka leti landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga tshukaka xi nga hlanganisiwi eka khoso yo letela kumbe eka tibuku?","The correct answer is **D: Ku tlanga hi ku ku encenyeta** (Dealing with harassment).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tibuku leti vulavulaka hi tindlela to hanya emananga ti tele, kambe leti vulavulaka hi laha ku nga na nyimpi a hi tingani."" This translates to: ""Books that deal with harassment are available, but we don't have ones for situations where there *isn't* harassment.""  This implies harassment is covered, but situations *without* harassment are not.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku hanya emananga (Harassment):** The passage *mentions* dealing with harassment, saying resources are available.
* **B: Ku lulamela mpfuno wa xilamulela mhangu (Meeting the needs of management):** The course includes a leadership component (""katseka eka vuleteri bya xilamulela mhangu""), meaning it *addresses* this.
* **C: Ku lulamela ndhawu ya nyimpi (Dealing with a hostile environment):** The course is specifically a ""Hostile environment course"", so it directly deals with this.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka timhaka leti landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga tshukaka xi hlanganisiwa eka khoso yo letela?","The correct answer is **D: Tindhawu to nonon’hwa swinene (hostile environments)**.

Here's why:

The passage directly states the course is called 'Hostile environment course' and focuses on learning how to operate *in* those environments. The passage also mentions that the course will take you to companies that operate in these environments. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mpfuno wa xilamulela mhangu (Leadership needs)** - While the course *may* touch on leadership, it's not the primary focus.
* **B: Tindhawu ta nyimpi (War zones)** - The passage specifically contrasts situations *with* conflict to those *without*.  It's about broadly hostile environments, not just war.
* **C: Ku hanya emananga (Conflict resolution)** -  While dealing with conflict might be *part* of operating in a hostile environment, it isn't the main subject of the course itself.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi yihi ndlela leyinene yo papalata mati lama kumbexana ma thyakeke?","The correct answer is **B: Ku xava mati ya mabodlhele** (To boil the water).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...loko sweswo swi ku vilerisa u nga xava mati ya mabodlhele eka khampani leyi tshembekaka."" ( ...if that doesn't work, boil the water from a trusted company). This directly suggests boiling as a reliable method for making water safe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku vurisa mali timinete ti nga ri tingani** (Measuring money for minutes) - This is irrelevant to water purification.
* **C: Ku virisa mati ku ringana minete yin’we** (Boiling water for only one minute) - The passage doesn't specify a time, and one minute is often insufficient to kill harmful bacteria.
* **D: Ku kamba mati eka swakudya swo karhi** (Mixing water with hot food) - This wouldn't purify the water; it might just warm it up.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga tshukaka xi tika hambi kuri eka vahlamberi lava nga ni vuswikoti?","The correct answer is **B: Ku hlambela ematini yo enta (Swimming in flowing water)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that rip currents are strong currents that pull swimmers *into* the ocean (ematini yo enta). It warns that people drown trying to swim *against* these currents.  The passage advises seeking help if you're caught in one, implying avoiding strong currents is key for those without strong swimming skills.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku hlambela ekusuhi ni maribye ya le ndzeni ka mati (Swimming near shallow water reefs):** The passage doesn't mention reefs.
* **C: Ku hlambela u langutane ni moya (Swimming against the wind):** Wind isn't the primary danger discussed.
* **D: Ku hlambela emagandlatini (Swimming in currents):**  The passage warns *against* swimming in currents, especially for weak swimmers.



"
Xana u fanele ku endla yini loko u kokiwa hi magandlati lama hobomulanaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Ringeta ku huma eka magandlati ya matimba hi ku ya eka tlhelo rin’wana, ivi u hlambela u ya eribuweni hi ntolovelo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Loko u pone eka gandlati rero, swi nga ku tikela ku tlhelela laha a wu ri kona. Ringeta ku ya endhawini leyi hlayisekeke..."" (If you find yourself in a rip current, it is best to swim parallel to where you are. Try to swim to a side...) and ""...loko u nga ri na vuswikoti kombela van’wana va ta ku pfuna"" (if you are not strong enough ask others to help you).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hlambela hi rivilo u langutane ni moya** - Swimming vigorously against the current (and the wind) is exactly what the passage warns *against*.
* **C: Hlambela u ya eka tlhelo rin’wana** - While swimming to the side is part of the solution, it's not the complete answer. You need to swim *parallel* to shore first, then angle back to safety.
* **D: Hlambela u dzika endzeni** - Swimming underwater is not a recommended strategy and could be dangerous.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi le ka ndhawu yihi laha ku endzela xihondzo ku nga vaka nkarhi wo wisa lowu phyuphyisaka?","The correct answer is **C: Minkova ya le Rhine**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""minkova ya le Rhine"" (the banks of the Rhine) as an example of a beautiful place to visit. The question asks where one could go for a scenic boat trip. While the other options are mentioned, the Rhine is presented *as an example* of a good place for such a trip.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Doroba leri longolokaka na Danube:** The passage mentions the Danube but doesn't specifically highlight a town along it as being particularly good for scenic trips.
*   **B: Ekusuhi na Eri Canal:**  Erie Canal is mentioned, but again, not specifically highlighted as a superior choice.
*   **D: Ekusuhi ni tiva ra mati:** Too general; the passage focuses on *specific* scenic locations.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki xitsundzuxo lexinene eka vavasati lava endzelaka ndhawu leyi?","The correct answer is **B: Ku xiya leswaku ku hambana ka ndhavuko ku nga ha vangela timholovo eka lava tshamaka endhawini leyi.**

Here's why:

* **The passage strongly emphasizes the dangers of cultural differences.** It warns women that differences in upbringing can be used to manipulate or harm them (""ku hambana ka ndhavuko swi nga va nga leswi vuriwaka ku khoma khoma munhu hi ndlela yo biha""). It explicitly states cultural differences don't excuse harmful behavior (""ku hambana ka mi ndhavuko a swi vuli leswaku swi lulamile!"").  The text is advising women to be cautious because of these differences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku papalata ku bula hi timhaka ta vatekani (Being afraid to live with men's issues):** While the passage warns about men, it doesn't suggest a general fear of living *with* men, but rather a caution *around* them.
* **C: Ku papalata ku ambala rhingi (Being afraid to dress brightly):** The passage mentions dressing brightly, but frames it as something that might attract unwanted attention, not as something to be feared in itself.
* **D: Ku sihalala loko swi laveka (To be quiet when it is necessary):** While discretion is implied, the core message is about being aware and protecting oneself from potential harm, not simply being quiet.



"
"Hi ku landza ndhawu leyi hlamuseriwaka eka xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xitsundzuxo lexi nga pfunaka vavasati lava nga vaendzi?","The correct answer is **C: Ku twisisa leswaku ku hambana ka ndhavuko ku ringanyeta leswaku u papalata ku va ni ntshiva.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Vavasati va fanele va lemuka leswaku ku hambana ka ndhavuko swi nga va nga leswi vuriwaka ku khoma khoma munhu hi ndlela yo biha naswona swi tolovelekile ku landzeleriwa, ku khomiwa hi voko, sweswo sweswo.""  This translates to ""Women should remember that cultural differences should not be taken as a reason to harm a person and it is acceptable to be assertive, to speak out, etc.""  This directly relates to understanding that cultural differences don't excuse disrespectful or harmful behavior and encourages self-advocacy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku xiya leswaku a swi tolovelekanga ku landzeleriwa** - While the passage *implies* assertiveness is good, it doesn't say it's unacceptable to be accommodating.  It says to be assertive *despite* cultural differences.
* **B: Ku ambala rhingi leyikulu ku kombisa ku va u nghenele vukati** - The passage mentions ""ku ambala rhingi"" but says it's *not* good and shouldn't be done excessively.
* **D: Loko u tshuka u gangisiwa, ala vavanuna u ba ha ehansi hi nenge** - The passage doesn't promote violence or physical confrontation. It emphasizes speaking out and asserting oneself, not physical aggression.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xiyimo lexi nga tshukaka xi lava muteki wa swifaniso swa swiharhi a tirhisa khamera ya tilense yo karhi?","The correct answer is **A: Loko a teka swifaniso swa swivumbiwa leswitsongo ngopfu** (When taking pictures of very small objects).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...minkarhi yo tala swi lava ku tirhisa khamera ya tilense to leha hambileswi swilo swo fana ni swinyenyana kumbe swiharhi leswitsongo swi lavaka tilense tin'wana.""  This translates to: ""...often it is necessary to use a long-focus camera, especially when taking pictures of things like insects or small objects that require different lenses.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Loko swifaniso swi ta tirhiseriwa ku xavisiwa** (When the pictures will be used for exhibition) - While important, the passage doesn't link this *specifically* to needing a long-focus lens.
* **C: Loko swiharhi leswi tekiwaka swifaniso swi ri ni tingana** (When the subject of the picture has spots) - The passage mentions spots as a potential problem, but doesn't say a long-focus lens is *needed* to deal with it.
* **D: Loko phaki yi ri ni milawu yo karhi malunghana ni swifaniso swa swiharhi** (When the photographer has rules regarding taking pictures) -  Rules don't dictate the *type* of camera needed.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga boxiwiki eka xiyenge lexi tanihi leswi tikaka eka vateki va swifaniso swa swiharhi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku kuma swiharhi leswi nga riki swa tiko rero (Capturing subjects that are not in their natural state)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions: ""Swiharhi swo tala leswi nga riki swa tiko rero swa kala ku swi kuma naswona mintanga yin'wana yi na milawu mayelana ni ku teka swifaniso leswaku munhu a ta swi xavisa."" This translates to ""Many subjects that are not in their natural state are difficult to capture, and some cultures have rules about taking pictures that a person might find offensive.""  This directly addresses the challenge of photographing subjects out of context or in a sensitive manner.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku langutana ni swiharhi swo kariha (Dealing with blurry subjects):** The passage *mentions* blurry photos as a possibility, but it's not the core challenge presented for photographers.
* **C: Ku kuma tilense leti lavekaka (Finding suitable lenses):**  While lenses are discussed, the passage focuses on the *subject* and its context, not the equipment.
* **D: Ku tirha eka mbango wo tika swinene (Working with good lighting):** Lighting is implied as important for a good photo, but it's not the main point the passage is making about ethical and cultural considerations when photographing subjects.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga tshukaka xi vanga swiphiqo leswi nga nyawuriki eka muchayeri loyi a fambaka etintshaveni?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku tikeriwa ku vona kahle** (Difficulty seeing clearly).

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions that ""gamboko"" (fog/mist) can make it difficult to see clearly (""u nga ha tsandzeka ku vona kahle hikwalaho ka gamboko leyi nga eku neni kumbe leyi nga eku hungeni kumbe hikwalaho ka mathonsi lamatsongo ya mati""). This directly relates to a potential problem for a driver in mountainous areas.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ku tala ka mimovha** (Too much traffic) - The passage doesn't focus on traffic.
* **B: Ku khuhlana ku le hansi** (Low ground) - While mentioned, it's used as an example of a gondzo (cliff) that's dangerous *because* of potential fog, not the primary danger itself.
* **C: Nkahelo lowukulu** (Large distance) - The passage doesn't discuss distance as a hazard.

The passage explicitly states: ""...ti rheyiti na tlawa wa xibalo swi hambanile ku suka eka tiko kuya eka rin’wana."" which translates to ""...tax rates and tax brackets differ from country to country.""  The passage is discussing how income tax calculations vary internationally, and the *rates* are a key factor in those differences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tirheyiti** (Rates) - While related, ""swiyenge swa xibalo"" (tax rates) is more specific and accurate in this context.
*   **B: Ku hleriwa** (Deductions) - Deductions can affect tax *liability*, but the passage focuses on the underlying rates.
*   **C: Laha u vikaka kona xibalo** (Where you file taxes) - The passage mentions *where* you work affects taxes in federal systems, but isn't the primary thing that differs between countries.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, loko u tirha entsungeni kambe u tshama kun’wana, u nga ha tshuka u rhumela kwihi xibalo xa muholo?","The correct answer is **A: Kwihi ni kwihi laha hakanyingi u tshamaka kona** (Wherever you mostly reside).

Here's why:

The passage states that in federal countries like the United States and Canada, income tax is calculated based on *both* the federal level *and* the location where you reside, because rates and rules differ by location.  Therefore, if you work remotely but live somewhere, you'll likely need to file taxes in the place where you primarily live.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Le United States:**  This is too specific. The passage mentions the US as *an example* of a federal country, but doesn't say everyone should file there.
* **C: Eka tiko leri u tirhaka eka rona sweswi:** (The country you currently work for) This doesn't account for residency and differing local tax laws.
* **D: Kwihi ni kwihi laha tihakelo ti nga le hansi:** (Wherever taxes are lower)  While people might *want* to do this, the passage doesn't suggest this is the rule.  Tax obligations are based on residency, not simply finding the lowest rate.

Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga hlamuseliki hi ku kongoma World’s Fair?,"The correct answer is **D: Matiko a ma boheki ku hoxa xandla**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Matiko lama hlanganyelaka ma lunghiselela minkombiso..."" (Countries participating *prepare* exhibitions...) This implies participation, not simply being allowed to attend.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Minkombiso yi nga ha kombisa matimu kumbe ndhavuko wa tiko** - The passage explicitly states this: ""...ma kombisa swiphiqo swa misava kumbe ndhavuko ni matimu ya matiko ya vona"" (exhibitions show the culture and traditions of their countries).
* **B: Minkombiso ya timbala yi kombisiwa swin’we ni ya vutshila ni ya dyondzo** - The passage explains that World’s Fair combines culture and science.
* **C: Swiendlakalo swa kona swi nga teka ku fika eka tin’hweti ta ntsevu** - The passage states: ""Swiendlakalo leswi hi ntolovelo swi teka nkarhi lowu nga exikarhi ka tin’hweti tinharhu ni ta tsevu"" (The event usually takes between 3 and 6 months).

Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nawu wa World’s Fair kumbe International Exposition?,"The correct answer is **A: Minkombiso yi fanele ku kombisa matimu ni swiphiqo swa misava** (Exhibitions should showcase themes and products of industry).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Matiko lama hlanganyelaka ma lunghiselela minkombiso ya vutshila ni ya dyondzo eka timbala ta mintlangu ta tiko leswaku ma kombisa swiphiqo swa misava kumbe ndhavuko ni matimu ya matiko ya vona."" (Participating countries prepare industrial and educational exhibitions in various national pavilions to showcase products of industry or tradition and the themes of their countries.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage says World's Fairs *can* happen annually (though not consistently), but doesn't say a *single* country can hold them every year.
* **C:** The passage states they take *between* 3 and 6 months, not necessarily up to 6 months.
* **D:** The passage doesn't state all countries *must* participate for the event to exist, only that participating countries prepare exhibits.

Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi ku xi endla swi nga sivelaka ku hlaseriwa hi xiharhi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku tamela mintsembyana ya risuna**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lembe ni lembe vanhu vo tala va vaviseka hikuva va tshinela ngopfu ekusuhi ni swiharhi."" (Every year many people are injured because they get too close to bears).  This implies approaching young bears (mintsembyana ya risuna) is dangerous.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku basisa ekhempeni:** The text warns *against* basisa ekhempeni (camping) near bears, not that it causes attacks.
* **C: Ku va ekule hi mpfhuka wa 25 wa timitara eka timhisi:** This describes the size difference between bears and other animals, it doesn’t cause attacks.
* **D: Ku hlongola swiharhi swi swiphemu swa swakudya:** The text specifically says *not* to offer food to bears.

Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga boxiwiki eka xiyenge lexi tanihi lexi nga vangelaka ku hlaseriwa hi swiharhi?,"The correct answer is **A: Risema lerikulu**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically warns about leaving food out (risema lerikulu) as it attracts bears and other large animals, leading to dangerous encounters with humans. It states: ""Ku engetela kwalaho, tivonele eka risema leri vitanaka tibere ni swiharhi swin’wana, kutani papalata ku khoma kumbe ku sweka swakudya leswi nga ni risema u tlhela u basisa ekhempeni ya wena."" (Furthermore, be careful with food around bears and other animals, and don't leave any food out to attract them to your camp).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku tsandzeka ku va ekule na swona (Being too close to them):** While the passage mentions maintaining distance (100m for elk, 25m for other animals), it doesn't identify *this* as the primary cause of attacks. It's a preventative measure.
* **C: Ku nyika swiharhi swakudya (Feeding the animals):** The passage explicitly states animals *should not* be fed. This is a contributing factor to them becoming bold, but the main issue highlighted is the attraction of food left unattended.
* **D: Swiharhi leswi nga tolovelangiki vanhu (Animals that don't tolerate humans):**  The passage discusses how animals *can* become dangerous when attracted to food, not simply that they inherently dislike people.
