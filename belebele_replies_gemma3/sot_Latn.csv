"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e ka thusang ho tiisa bohlokwa ba boiketlo ba diphoofolo ho basebetsi ba hlabang diphoofolo ba Australia?","The correct answer is **A: Ho kenya dikhamera tsa CCTV**.

Here's why:

The passage directly states: """"CCTV e tla feela e romele letshwao le matla ho batho ba sebetsang ka diphoofolo hore tshwaro ya tsona e ntle ke taba ya bohlokwa bo phahameng ka ho fetisisa."""" 

This means CCTV cameras will *signal* the importance of good animal welfare to those working with animals. The other options aren't directly mentioned as methods to improve welfare standards in the text.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, mosebetsi wa motho ya neng a tshwerwe ke ofe?","The correct answer is **A: Moithuti**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...moithuti e mong o ile a tshwarwa mabapi le ho thunyana sekolong..."" ( ""...a student was arrested in connection with a plot at school..."")

This directly identifies the person arrested as a student. Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Moqolotsi oa ditaba wa Minneapolis Star-Tribune** - The passage mentions someone from the Minneapolis Star-Tribune (a source), but not that *they* were arrested.
* **C: Modula-setulo wa Merabe** - While the arrested individual's father *is* a tribal chairman, the passage says the *son* was arrested, not the father.
* **D: Ofisiri e Letsheng le Lekgubedu** - The passage mentions police/law enforcement, but doesn't say the arrested person is an officer.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ha ditaba di ntse di hasana ka ho tshwarwa hape, ho ne ho ntse ho etswa mapato a batho ba bakae?","The correct answer is **B: A mararo**.

The text states: ""...ho tshwaruwa mapato a Jeff Weise le bahlaseduwa ba bararo..."" which translates to ""...arrest warrants for Jeff Weise and three suspects..."" 

Therefore, warrants were issued for three people."
"Ho arabela boipelaetso, ke naha efe e sa kang ya tswela pele ka tumellano ya bona ya ACTA e saennweng?","The correct answer is **B: Poland**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Kgwedi e fetileng, ho ne ho e na le diteraeke tse kgolo Poland ha naha eo e saena ACTA, ho bakileng hore mmuso wa Mapolishe o nke qeto ya ho se amohele tumellano, ha jwale."" This means Poland initially signed ACTA but then *reversed* its decision and chose not to ratify it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jeremane:** The text only mentions police monitoring protests in German cities; it doesn't say Germany has reversed its stance on ACTA.
*   **C: Scotland:** Protests occurred in Edinburgh and Glasgow (Scotland), but the text doesn't mention Scotland's official position on ACTA.
*   **D: Lithuania:** Vilnius (Lithuania) is listed as a city where protests took place, but again, there's no information about Lithuania's ratification status.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho dinaha tse latelang e nkileng qeto ya ho tjhetjhisa mokhwa wa ho kenela ACTA?","The correct answer is **D: Latvia**.

The passage states: ""Latvia and Slovakia both suspended the process of acceding to ACTA.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Estonia** - The passage mentions Tallinn, Estonia as a city where protests occurred, but doesn't state they suspended ACTA accession.
*   **B: Lithuania** - The passage mentions Vilnius, Lithuania as a city where protests occurred, but doesn't state they suspended ACTA accession.
*   **C: Scotland** - The passage mentions Edinburgh and Glasgow, Scotland as cities where protests occurred, but doesn't state Scotland (as a nation) suspended ACTA accession.



"
Ke batho ba bakae ba ileng ba tswa dikotsi ka lebaka la diketsahalo tsa ho tjhesa ka ho feteletseng ha iPod?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The passage states: ""...sa siya batho ba bane ba na le dikotsi tsa ho tjha tse nyane."" which translates to ""...leaving four people with minor burn injuries.""
"
Ke mang ya boletseng hore diketsahalo tsa ho tjhesa ka ho feteletseng di ne di se kotsi haholo?,"The correct answer is **D: Apple**.

The text states: ""Apple e ba tsebisitse ka diketsahalo tse ding tse 34 tsa tlatsetso tsa ho futhumala ho feta tekanyo, tseo khampani e di bitsitseng """"tse seng mahlonoko."""""". This means Apple described the overheating incidents as not being seriously dangerous.



"
"Nakong ya puo ya hae, Steve Jobs o itse Apple e tla tsosolosa eng?","The correct answer is **B: Mohala (Phone)**.

Here's why:

The text states Steve Jobs said, """"Kajeno Apple e tla hlahisa botjha founu ena, Re tlo etsa pale kajeno"""" which translates to ""Today Apple will reinvent this phone, we will make history today.""  He was clearly referring to relaunching or reinventing the *phone* (mohala).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Histori (History):** While he says they will *make* history, he isn't *reintroducing* history.
*   **C: Khamphani (Company):** He's talking about a product, not the company itself.
*   **D: Theknoloji (Technology):** While the phone utilizes technology, he specifically mentions ""founu ena"" (this phone).



"
Sepheo sa puo ya Steve Jobs ya dihora tse pedi e ne e le eng?,"The correct answer is **C: Ho qala fono e ntjha** (To launch a new phone).

Here's why:

The text states Steve Jobs said, ""Kajeno Apple e tla hlahisa botjha founu ena, Re tlo etsa pale kajeno"" which translates to ""Today Apple will reinvent this phone, We will make history today."" This clearly indicates the purpose of the speech was to unveil a new phone.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho qala tablet e ntjha** (To launch a new tablet) - The text specifically mentions a ""founu"" (phone), not a tablet.
*   **B: Ho qala k’hompuyutha e ntjha** (To launch a new computer) - The text focuses on a phone.
*   **D: Ho phatlalatsa ho tlohela mosebetsi** (To announce retirement) - The text describes a product launch, not a resignation."
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner o phatlaladitse eng ho Sebakeng sa Theatre sa Argentina?,"The correct answer is **A: Bokgethwa ba hae ba mopresidente**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Mof. Kirchner o phatlaladitse maikemisetso a hae a ho iketela bopresidente a le mane Argentine Theatre..."" which translates to ""Ms. Kirchner announced her presidential aspirations at the Argentine Theatre..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Morero wa hae wa ho emela Senate:** While she *started* her Senate career at the theatre, the passage specifically states she announced her *presidential* candidacy there.
*   **C: Letsholo la hae bakeng sa moifo wa profinse ya Buenos Aires:** This is mentioned as something she did *in the past* (2005), not what she announced this time.
*   **D: Morero wa hae wa ho itokolla jwalo ka mosenate wa hajwale:** The passage says she *is* a current senator, and is announcing a run for president, not resigning her current role.



"
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner o phatlaladitse morero wa hae wa ho matha hokae?,"The correct answer is **D: Sebakeng sa diketsahalo sa La Plata se Buenos Aires**.

Here's why:

The text states she announced her candidacy *in* La Plata, which is 50 kilometers (31 miles) *from* Buenos Aires.  Therefore, the announcement location is in La Plata relative to Buenos Aires.



"
Diphuputso tsa ACMA mabapi le Big Brother e bile dife?,"The correct answer is **A: Melao ya dithibelo e ne e so tlolwe** (The rules of prohibition had not been violated).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ACMA hape e fumane hore leha vidiyo e phatlaladitswe Inthaneteng, Big Brother ha e a roba melawana ya thibelo ya inthaneteng hobane masedinyana ha a eso bolokwe webosaeteng ya Big Brother.""  This means the regulations weren't broken *because* the content wasn't hosted on Big Brother's server.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ho fumanwe metjha ya ditaba e bolokilwe webosaeteng ya Big Brother** (New content was found stored on Big Brother's server) - The passage states the opposite - content wasn't *on* their server.
* **C: Melao ya dithibelo e ne e tlotswe** (The rules of prohibition had been violated) - This is directly contradicted by the passage.
* **D: Ho fumanwe hore ditaba di ne di dula ho seva** (It was found that the content resided on the server) - Again, the passage states the content was *not* on the server.



"
Metjha ya ditaba e tlameha ho wela tlasa maemo afe e le hore e nkwe e le ditaba tsa inthanete?,"The correct answer is **B: E tlameha ho dula ho seva**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...ho nkuwa e le dikateng tsa inthanete, o tlameha ho dula ho seva e le ka nnete."" ( ...to be considered internet content, it must reside on a server.) 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E tlameha ho phatlalatswa inthaneteng** - While being published online is *necessary*, it's not *sufficient*.  The text says just publishing isn't enough.
* **C: E ke ke ya bolokwa webosaeteng** -  The text specifically says the opposite is true *if* it's to be considered internet content.
* **D: E tlameha ho amohelwa ke ACMA** - ACMA is mentioned as having *found* something, not as an authority that needs to *approve* content to be considered internet content.



"
Moetapele oa Liberal Party ya Australia ke mang?,"The correct answer is **B: John Howard**.

Here's why:

The passage states Peter Costello is expected to *succeed* John Howard as the Liberal leader. This means John Howard is currently the leader. While Peter Costello is a prominent figure, he isn't the current leader *according to the text*.



"
Ke hobaneng ha Australia e se na indasteri ya matla a nyutlelie?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho hloka tshebetso ya setjhaba (Lack of public support)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Peter Costello believes Australia *should* pursue nuclear power ""if it is economically feasible"".  His statement ""if it is approved on its merits, we should have it"" implies that currently it isn't approved, likely due to a lack of support. The passage doesn't mention safety concerns (C), cost (D), or a surplus of information (B). It focuses on economic feasibility *and* public acceptance as key requirements.

Therefore, the most logical inference is that Australia doesn't have a nuclear industry because of a lack of public support preventing its development."
Ke sebapadi sefe sa ski se ileng sa hlodisana ka thuso ya motataisi?,"The correct answer is **C: Maciej Krezel**.

The passage states: ""Mothellisi wa lehlweng ya sa boneng hantle wa Poland Maciej Krezel le motataiso wa hae Anna Ogarzynska ba qetile boemong ba leshome le metso e meraro ho Super-G."" This means Maciej Krezel competed with the help of a guide (Anna Ogarzynska).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Anna Jochemsen** - Competed alone.
*   **B: Jong Seork Park** - Competed alone.
*   **D: Anna Ogarzynska** - She was the *guide*, not the skier."
Ke naha efe e bileng ya leshome tlhodisanong ho Super-G bakeng sa boemo bo emeng ba basadi?,"The correct answer is **A: Finland**.

The passage states: ""Katja Saarinen of Finland finished in tenth place in this event."" This directly answers the question."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke polelo efe e buang ka Blake e sa nepahalang?","The correct answer is **B: O ile a dumela tlhaselo**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""sebohodi, se ileng sa tshwarwa sebakeng seo, se ile sa **hana tlhaselo** eo."" This directly contradicts option B, which states Blake admitted to the assault. The passage clearly states he *denied* the assault.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

*   **A: O ile a tshwarwa sebakeng seo** - The text says ""sebohodi, se ileng sa tshwarwa sebakeng seo..."" (the defendant, who was arrested at the scene...)
*   **C: O ile a sebedisa palo nakong ya tlhaselo** - The text says ""sa bolela hore se sebedisitse palo hore se itshireletse dibotlolong..."" (stated that he used a shield to protect himself from bottles...)
*   **D: O ile a bolela hore o ile a furuletswa ka dibotlolo** - The text says ""...dibotlolong tse neng di lahlelwa ho sona ke batho ba ka bang mashome a mararo."" (...bottles being thrown at him by around thirty people.)"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e sa kang ya etsahalla Blake?","The correct answer is **A: O ile a fumanwa a le molato ka baka la kgopamiso ya toka.**

Here's why:

The passage states Blake was **tried** for perverting the course of justice, but it **doesn't say he was found guilty**. It only says the prosecutor suggested imprisonment was ""inevitable"".

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **B: O ile a tshwarwa:** The passage says ""se ileng sa tshwarwa"" referring to Blake.
*   **C: O ile a hlaselwa ka palo:** The passage states ""sa bolela hore se sebedisitse palo hore se itshireletse dibotlolong tse neng di lahlelwa ho sona"".
*   **D: O ile a bolellwa hore a ka nna a iswa teronkong:** The passage says the prosecutor told Blake imprisonment was ""inevitable"".



"
Letlole la Mokgatlo wa U.N. la ho futhumala ha lefatshe le ke ke la sebedisetswa eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Ho fokotsa diphello tsa ho futhumala ha lefatshe** (To reduce the effects of global warming).

Here's why:

The passage states the U.N. hopes the funds will help countries *affected by climate change* (ho futhumala ha lefatshe) *cope with these effects*. Options A, B, and C are examples of *how* the money might be used to achieve that goal, but they aren't the overall goal itself.  Option D directly reflects the main purpose of the fund.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, Mokgatlo wa U.N. o tshepa ho pholosa eng?","The correct answer is **C: Meru e setseng**.

The passage states: ""Ditaba tse ding tse morerong ona mane Bali di kenyeletsa ho pholosa **meru e setseng ya lefatshe**...""  This directly translates to ""other items on the Bali agenda include saving the remaining forests of the world...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tjhelete, ka ho arolelana theknoloji** - While money and technology sharing *are* part of the plan, the UN isn't *saving* these things. They are tools to help with saving the forests and assisting nations.
*   **B: Dijalo** - While a change in crops is *mentioned* as something the funds can be used for, it's not what the UN hopes to save.
*   **D: Batho ba anngweng ke tsamaiso e mpe ya metsi** - The passage mentions helping nations affected by climate change (which can include water issues), but the primary thing the UN hopes to *save* is the forests.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa kang ya qotswa ke-Albert Muchanga e le ntho eo ho ntseng ho hlokahala hore ho dumellanwe ka yona?,"The correct answer is **D: Ditumellano tsa ditefiso** (Tariff concessions).

The text specifically states: ""Mokhomishenara o itse, """"Ha re eso ka re dumellana mabapi le melawana ya ho thehwa le dinyehlisetso tsa ditharife, empa moralo oo re nang le wona o lekane ho qala kgwebisano ka la 1 Phupu, 2020"""".""

This translates to ""The Commissioner said, 'We have not yet agreed on rules of origin and tariff concessions, but the plan we have is sufficient to start trading on July 1, 2020'.""

Therefore, tariff concessions are the unresolved issue mentioned by Albert Muchanga. Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Haeba Benin e ka kenela AfCTA** (Whether Benin can join AfCTA) - He confirmed Benin *will* join.
*   **B: Letsatsi leo kgwebo e ka qalang ka lona** (The date trade can begin) - He mentioned July 1, 2020.
*   **C: Melao ya tshimoloho** (Rules of origin) - He stated they haven't agreed on these *along with* tariff concessions. But the question asks what he specifically identified as still needing agreement.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, hobaneng khwebo e ka qala ka Phupu?","The correct answer is **B: Ho na le moralo o lekaneng wa melao le ditumellano tse teng**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""…but the plan we have is sufficient to start trade by July 1, 2020"".  This directly indicates that the reason trade *can* start on July 1st is because there's a plan in place, even if all the details (rules of origin and tariff concessions) aren't finalized yet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage says Nigeria *announced its intention* to join, not that July 1st was a condition *of* their joining.
* **C:** The Commissioner's announcement doesn't *cause* trade to start, it simply reports on the status.
* **D:** The passage explicitly states they haven't *agreed* on the rules of origin and tariff concessions.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution e ile ya qosa diofisiri tsa thuto ka eng?","The correct answer is **C: Ho se sebetse ka mathata a ka hare a fumanweng**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's report ""showed problems with the test scores"" and ""revealed that test scores had increased at an improbably rapid pace, and suggested the schools had internal problems but she did not address these findings."" This directly indicates the accusation was about failing to deal with internal issues related to the test scores.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho senya tlaleho ya Journal-Constitution:** The passage doesn't mention anything about damaging the report itself.
*   **B: Ho hloleha ho qapa thuto ya ditoropo:** While the superintendent was recognized for urban education, the accusation wasn't about failing to shape it, but about issues with test results.
*   **D: Ho tlaleha dintlha tse tlase tsa tlhahlobo:** The opposite is true - the issue was with unusually *high* test scores.



"
"Ho latela dintlha tse fanweng serapeng sena, ke eng e sa bolelwang tlalehong ya Atlanta Journal-Constitution?","The correct answer is **A: Ntlafatso ya dintlha tse sa tlwaelehang tsa tlhahlobo (Improvement of unusually high test scores)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Atlanta Journal-Constitution report *showed* the increase in test scores was ""statistically improbable"" - meaning unusually high and suspicious. However, it doesn't *state* they were trying to find ways to improve the scores. They were investigating *why* they were so unusual.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bopaki ba hore dipampiri tsa tlhahlobo di ile tsa senngwa (Evidence that test papers were tampered with):** The passage explicitly states that evidence of test tampering *emerged* after the report.
*   **C: Mohlodi wa Mookamedi wa Naha wa Selemo wa-2013 (The reason for the National Superintendent of the Year award in 2013):**  The passage doesn't mention the award in 2013, only in 2009.
*   **D: Ditlhahiso tsa ho ntlafatsa thuto ya ditoropo (Suggestions for improving urban education):** The passage focuses on a scandal, not suggestions for improvement.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke boitsebiso bofe bo tsejwang ka mora ho phatloha ha dibomo?","The correct answer is **B: Ke meaho efe eo dibomo di ileng tsa phatloha haufi le yona**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states a bomb exploded **outside the prime minister's office** and **near government buildings**. This directly answers what buildings were near the explosions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Palo ya ho qetela ya dikotsi** - The passage says the final number of casualties is *not yet known* (dipalo tsa bofelo ha di eso tsejwe hajwale).
*   **C: Haeba ho ne ho ka qhomiswa dibomo tse eketsehileng** - The passage doesn't mention any expectation of further explosions.
*   **D: Palo e molaong ya batho ba shweleng** - While the passage confirms deaths, it states the official number is *up to* 30, not a definite number (batho ba ka fihlang ho 30 ba lemetse).



"
"Ho tloha ha a kena Manchester City ka-2017, Jesus o bapetse dipapadi tse kae?","The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The text explicitly states: ""Haesale ho tloha mona, moBrazil enwa o bapetse dipapading tse 53 bakeng sa tlelapa ena ditlhodisanong tsohle..."" which translates to ""Since then, this Brazilian has played 53 matches for this club in all competitions..."""
Ke sehlopha sefe seo Jesus a ileng a fumana tefo ya £27 milione bakeng sa ho kena?,"The correct answer is **A: Palmeiras**.

The text states that Jesus came from Palmeiras and Manchester City paid £27 million *to* Palmeiras for his transfer. Therefore, Palmeiras is the team that received the £27 million fee."
Ke polelo efe e mabapi le baeti ba hostele eo e seng nnete?,"The correct answer is **D: Bongata ba baeti bo ne bo tswa motseng o halalelang**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states the majority of hostel guests were from the **United Arab Emirates**, which is a separate country, not Mecca itself (a holy city).

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

*   **A: Baeti ba ne ba le Mecca bakeng sa leeto la bodumedi** - The passage mentions they were in Mecca during the Islamic holy period and visiting the holy city, implying a religious pilgrimage.
*   **B: Baeti ba bang e ne e se baahi ba moo** -  The passage states the guests were from the United Arab Emirates, meaning they were not locals of Mecca.
*   **C: Baeti ba ne ba le teng bosiung ba pele ho Hajj** - The passage says the hostel had many pilgrims visiting during the hajj season, implying they were preparing for the hajj and would be there the night before.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho dipolelo tse latelang eo e leng nnete?","The correct answer is **C: Baeti ba ne ba le teng pele ho leeto la hajj**.

Here's why:

*   **The text states:** ""...badumedi ba bangata ba tlileng ho etela toropokgolo e halalelang mafelong a nako e halalelang ya bohalaledi ya hajj."" This means the visitors are in Mecca *during* the Hajj pilgrimage period, implying they arrived before or at the beginning of it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho ne ho se na batho ba shweleng** - The text explicitly states ""Palo ya batho ba shweleng ke bonyane 15.""
*   **B: Baeti bohle ba ne ba tswa United Arab Emirates** - The text says ""Baeti ba hostele bongata e ne e le baahi ba United Arab Emirates,"" meaning *most* were from the UAE, not all.
*   **D: Bongata ba baeti e ne e le baahi ba Mecca** - The text states the majority were from the UAE, not Mecca.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke boitsebiso bofe bo mabapi le ho thulana bo sa tsitsang?","The correct answer is **C: Tshusumetso ya hothulana Lefatsheng** (Impact of the collision on Earth).

Here's why:

The passage states that scientists are trying to determine ""how large the impact was and how Earth would be affected."" This directly addresses the impact *on Earth* caused by the collision.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Boholo ba ho thulana** (Size of the collision) - While the passage mentions the objects were large and fast, it focuses on the *results* of the collision rather than its exact size. Scientists are *trying to find out* how large the impact was.
*   **B: Sebaka sa ho thulana** (Location of the collision) - The passage does not mention the location of the collision.
*   **D: Sebaka sa malwanlahla** (Location of the debris) - The passage mentions the US Department of Defense is tracking debris, but doesn't focus on the location itself as a key piece of information being sought.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the text is how the collision will affect Earth."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e ntseng e lokela ho tsejwa mabapi le ho thulana?","The correct answer is **D: Sekala se nepahetseng hantle sa ho thulana** (The exact scale of the collision).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ba ntse ba leka ho fumana hore ho thulana hona ho ne ho le hoholo hakae le hore Lefatshe le tla ameha jwang."" (They are trying to find out how large the collision was and how Earth will be affected.) This directly indicates that the *scale* or magnitude of the collision is what scientists are still working to determine.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ke mang ya tla sebetsana le ho latelwa ha malwanlahla** (Who will deal with tracking debris) - The passage mentions tracking, but doesn't say who will handle it.
*   **B: Disathelaete di ne di tsamaya kapele hakae nakong eo ya ho thulana** (How fast were the satellites traveling during the collision) - This information is *given* in the passage, not something needing to be discovered.
*   **C: Diphetho tsa tlhahlobo ya moralo di tla arolelanwa jwang** (How the results of the analysis will be shared) - The passage states the results will be posted online, so this isn’t something still unknown.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke sebaka sefe seo Batten a kileng a ba le sona lethathamong la Batho ba ruileng ka ho Fetisisa ba Amerika?","The correct answer is **A: Ya bo-400**.

The passage states: ""Batten o bile maemong a 190 lenaneng la MaAmerika a Baruihadi ba 400 ka 2008..."" which translates to ""Batten was ranked 190 on the list of the 400 wealthiest Americans in 2008...""

However, this is a trick question because the passage says he was **ranked 190 on a list of 400**. It doesn't mean he was number 190 overall.  The passage also states that he was ranked **400** as well.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: Ya bo-400** as it states his position was 400."
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo Batten a entseng monehelo ho yona?,"Karabo e nepahetseng ke **B: Yunivesithi ya Virginia**.

Tsebo e fuoeng e tlatsitse ka ho hlalosa hore Batten o phethile dithuto tse phahameng ho Yunivesithi ya Virginia mme a bile monyehedi wa diphallelo e moholo wa sekolo sena. Ka hona, ho bonahala hore o entseng monehelo ho yona."
Ke eng eo e seng karolo ya bili e saennweng ke Musisi Arnold Schwarzenegger?,"The correct answer is **C: Thibelo ya thekiso kapa ho hira dipapadi tsa video tse mabifi ho bana ba ka ntle ho California**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states the bill concerns restricting *sales* within California (dipapadi tsa vidiyo tse rekiswang tse nang le dikgoka porofensing ya California). It doesn't mention anything about laws or restrictions outside of California.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The bill *is* about restricting the sale/rental of violent video games to children in California.
*   **B:** The bill *does* mention financial penalties for violations.
*   **D:** The bill *does* require a decal on violent games.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke bo-mang ba ileng ba fosa dintho tse neng di bolelwa?","The correct answer is **C: Miller**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Miller says he ""wasn't prepared and therefore didn't hear well what he was saying."" This directly indicates that Miller missed or didn't fully understand what was being said.  The passage doesn't state that Duvall's children missed anything, or that Duvall or Mike missed anything.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang eo e leng nnete ka phihlelo ya Miller nyeweng?","The correct answer is **B: O ne a sa ele hloko ha a ntse a itokisetsa**.

Here's why:

The passage states Miller said, """"Mike o bua haholo nakong ya dipuisano...ke ne ke sa itokisa mme ka hona ke ne ke sa utlwe hantle seo a se buang."""" This directly translates to ""...Mike talks a lot during discussions...I wasn't prepared and therefore didn't hear what he was saying well."" This shows Miller was distracted and not paying attention because he wasn't prepared.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Duvall o ile a kgahla Miller nakong ya nyewe** - The passage doesn't say Duvall was interested in Miller, just that the story concerned Miller.
*   **C: Bana ba babedi ba Duvall ba ile ba bua haholo nakong ya nyewe** - The passage mentions Duvall has two grown children, but doesn't say they were present or spoke during the conversation.
*   **D: O ne a shebile pale ya Duvall ka hloko** - The passage indicates Miller *didn't* fully understand what Duvall was saying, so he wasn't paying close attention to the story.



"
Ke mang ya entseng tlhahiso ya hore ho etswe ditokiso ho ‘Molao wa Moya o Hlwekileng’?,"The correct answer is **C: Jack Layton**.

The passage states: ""Layton o kopile ho etswa ha diphetoho ho bili ya dingangele (ma-conservative) ya tsa tikoloho nakong ya kopano le Tonakgolo..."" This directly translates to ""Layton requested amendments to the (Conservative) environmental bill during a meeting with the Prime Minister...""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: John Howard** - The passage states Howard *defended* the bill, not proposed changes.
* **B: Mokga wa Conservative** - The passage says Layton wanted changes *to* their bill, not that the Conservatives themselves proposed them.
* **D: Stephen Harper** - While Harper was present at the meeting, the passage states Layton made the request for amendments.

"""Ke mang ya hanneng hore """"Molao wa Moya o Hlwekileng """" o ne o sebediswa e le leano la pele ho dikgetho?""","The correct answer is **D: MP ya federale**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...mmuso wa profensi le Mapalamente a federale ba sehollotse molao ona ka hore ke sethetsa se reretsweng ho lebisa dikgethong tsa federale tse tla bitswa ka Pudungwana."" 

This directly translates to ""the provincial government and **federal MPs** opposed the law, saying it was a tactic intended to lead to the federal elections to be called in November.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ofisiri ya mmuso oa naha** - The text doesn't mention a specific government official making this claim.
*   **B: Tona-Kgolo** - The Prime Minister (John Howard) is described as *defending* the law, not opposing it as a pre-election tactic.
*   **C: Moetapele wa NDP** - Jack Layton requested changes to the bill but did not specifically accuse it of being a pre-election tactic.



"
Metswako ya cyanuric acid le melamine e ile ya etsa eng ha e kopana ka hara moroto wakatse?,"The correct answer is **C: Dikristale**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Bafuputsi ba bone dikristale di qaleha morotong wa katse la ho eletswa ha melamine le cyanuric acid."" (Researchers found crystals forming in the cat's urine when melamine and cyanuric acid were combined.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Diphio** - While the crystals *can* block kidneys, the question asks what the *combination* of the substances created, not the effect of the creation.
*   **B: Dijo tsa diphoofolo tsa lapeng** - The passage mentions the food as the *source* of the melamine and cyanuric acid, but not what they create in the urine.
*   **D: Sesebediswa sa -infrared spectroscopy** - FTIR was used to *identify* the crystals, but it wasn't what was created.



"
Bafuputsi ba ile ba sebedisa tekanyo ya ho hlahloba mahlasedi a kotsi ho bona eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Sebopeho sa kristale morotong wa phoofolo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bafuputsi ba bone dikristale di qaleha morotong wa katse la ho eletswa ha melamine le cyanuric acid. Sebopeho sa dikristale tsena se tshwana le tse fumanweng morotong wa diphoofotswana tsa lapeng tse kulang ha di bapiswa ka infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).""

This directly indicates that researchers used a method (infrared spectroscopy/FTIR) to examine the **structure of crystals in animal urine** to identify a link to the harmful substances.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mosebetsi oa diphio (Kidney function):** While the crystals *affect* kidney function, the passage doesn't say the method was used to measure that directly.
*   **C: Diphoofolo tsa lapeng tse amehileng (Pets involved):** The passage doesn't state the researchers used a method to identify *which* pets were affected, but rather to analyze what was found *in* the affected pets.
*   **D: Dijo tsa diphoofolo tse ruuwang lapeng tse silafetseng (Contaminated pet food):** The passage mentions contaminated food as the source, but doesn't say the method was used to analyze the food itself.



"
Ke mang ya ileng a re Luna ke “Mofumahadi ya Feteletseng”?,"The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The text states: ""Tommy Dreamer o itse """"Luna ene e le Mofumahadi wa pele wa Phetello."""" (Tommy Dreamer said ""Luna was the first Queen of Extreme."")

Therefore, Tommy Dreamer is the one who called Luna the ""Queen of Extreme."""
"""Ke mang ya ileng a bitsa Luna e le """"ya makatsang""""?""","The correct answer is **B: Dustin Runnels**.

The text states: ""Dustin """"Goldust"""" Runnels o boletse hore """"Luna o ne a makatsa jwalo ka nna...ebile mohlomong le ho feta..."""" which translates to ""Dustin """"Goldust"""" Runnels said """"Luna was amazing like me...and maybe even more...""""

Therefore, Dustin Runnels is the one who called Luna ""amazing""."
Ke eng e sa kang ya etsahala ka mokganni ya amehileng kotsing?,"The correct answer is **B: Ha aa ka a ntsha motho leha e le ofe ya neng a le ka tlung kotsi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Leha batho ba bararo ba ne ba le kahare ho ntlo ha koloi e e thula, ha ho batho ba lemetseng hara bona."" This means the driver didn't injure anyone *inside the house* that the car crashed into.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: O ile a tswa dikotsi hloohong** - The passage explicitly states he *did* sustain head injuries (""moqhobi yena o bile le ditemalo tse mahlonoko hloohong"").
*   **C: O ile a tloswa sepetleleng sa Cambridge ho ya ho se seng sa Great Yarmouth** - He was transferred *from* James Paget Hospital (Great Yarmouth) *to* Addenbrooke Hospital (Cambridge).
*   **D: Ditshebeletso tsa tshohanyetso di ile tsa mo thusa ho mo ntsha koloing ya hae** - The passage says emergency services were ""extracting the driver from the red Audi TT"", meaning they were helping him *out* of the car, not the other way around.



"
Ke eng e neng e sa hlahella ka papadi ya Afrika Borwa nakong ya tlhodisano ya rugby?,"The correct answer is **C: Tshebetso e ntlafaditsweng qalong ya tlhodisano**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Afrika Borwa e shebahala ntle ho pelaelo e le nthithi papading ya yona kgahlanong le bokgoni ba yona ba tswang borwa, leha ho le jwalo e ile ya ntlafala butle-butle ha tlhodisano e tswela pele."" This directly means their performance *improved* as the competition went on, implying it wasn't great at the beginning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mosebetsi o tsotehang wa sehlopha:** The passage highlights the team's excellent teamwork as a strength.
*   **B: Bokgoni ba ho tshwara bolo:** The passage mentions ball handling as a strength.
*   **D: Tsebo ya ho itshireletsa:** Defence is also mentioned as a strength of the team.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, papadi ya Afrika Borwa e qadile neng ho ntlafala?","The correct answer is **D: Ha tlhodisano e ntse e tswela pele**.

The passage states: ""Afrika Borwa e shebahala ntle ho pelaelo e le nthithi papading ya yona kgahlanong le bokgaitsedi ba yona ba tswang borwa, **leha ho le jwalo e ile ya ntlafala butle-butle ha tlhodisano e tswela pele**.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hoo e ka bang ka-10:00 hoseng** - This is when the game *started*, not when they improved.
*   **B: Ka mora ho tiisa tshireletso** - While good defense was mentioned, the passage doesn't say improvement followed directly from it.
*   **C: Ka mora ho hlolwa ke Zambia** - Afrika Borwa won against Zambia, they weren't defeated."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e sa bontsheng moruo wa China ka nepo?","The correct answer is **D: China ha e so ka e romela dikoloi tse ngata ho feta Jeremane**.

Here's why:

The passage *specifically states* that China ""sent more cars abroad than Germany"" and surpassed the United States as the largest market for cars.  Option D directly contradicts this information.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

*   **A: Moruo wa China o hotse haholo ho tloatsa ha ho etswe dintlafatso** - The passage mentions China has ""flourished economically"" since reforms began under Deng Xiaoping and that its economy has ""grown at an astonishing rate of 90 times.""
*   **B: China e na le mmaraka o moholo wa thekiso ya dikoloi ho feta United States** - The passage explicitly states this.
*   **C: China e ka qetella e na le GDP e kgolo ho feta United States** - The passage suggests this possibility, stating its GDP ""could surpass that of the United States within two decades.""



"
"Ho latela seratswana, GDP ya China e ne e ka feta United States neng?","The correct answer is **B: Nakong ya dilemo tse mashome a mabedi**.

The passage states: ""GDP ya China e ka ba kgolo ho feta ya United States nakong ya mengwahashome e mmedi."" (GDP of China could be larger than that of the United States in the next two decades.)
"
Hu o ile a etsa tlhahiso ya hore dinaha tse tswelang pele di etse eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Ho qoba ditsela tsa kgale tsa tshilafalo** (To avoid the old ways of pollution).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hu o kgothaleditse dinaha tse holang """"hore di qobe motjha wa kgale wa ho silafatsa pele ebe ba hlwekisa kamorao."""" "" This directly translates to ""Hu urged developing countries to avoid the old ways of polluting first and cleaning up later.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho nka boitlamo bo sutumetsang boemo ba tsona ba ntshetsopele** (To take commitments pushing their level of development) - While Hu does mention taking on more responsibility, the primary focus is *how* they develop, not simply pushing development.
*   **B: Tsepamisa maikutlo ho dihlahiswa tsa moruo** (Focus on economic production) - The passage mentions economic production *in relation to* carbon emission reduction, but doesn't suggest it should be the primary focus.
*   **C: Fetela ka nqane ho boikarabelo ba tsona ba hona jwale** (Settle for their current level of responsibility) - Hu specifically states they should take on *more* responsibility, not settle for the current level.



"
Ke eng e sa kang ya bolelwa ke Hu?,"The correct answer is **A: Motheo wa ho kgaoha** (The basis of negotiation).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on Hu's statements about carbon emission reductions, urging developing nations to avoid ""pollute first, clean up later,"" and emphasizing commitments beyond development levels.** It discusses *what* needs to be done, and *who* needs to do it.
* **Options B, C, and D are all directly mentioned in the passage:**
    * **B: Keletso ho dinaha tse tswelang pele mabapi le tshilafalo** (Advice to developing countries about pollution) - Hu directly advises them to avoid polluting first.
    * **C: Letsatsi leo ka tshepo ho tla fokotswa ho tswa ha khabone** (Date by which carbon emissions will be reduced) - He mentions a target by 2020 from 2005 levels.
    * **D: Setshwantsho sa ho fokotsa tlhahiso ya khabone** (Picture of reducing carbon production) - The entire passage is about reducing carbon intensity (emissions per GDP).

* **The passage *doesn't* discuss the underlying principles or negotiations that led to these statements.**  It simply presents Hu's pronouncements, not the groundwork for them.



Therefore, **A** is the only element *not* covered in the provided text."
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo Veerman a ileng a re boemo bo ne bo se botle?,"The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

The text states: ""Richard Veerman o re: """"Angola e tobane le sewa se sebe ka ho fetisisa sa yona mme boemo bo dutse ho le bobe haholo Angola,"""""". This directly indicates Veerman said the situation was bad in **Angola**.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Medecines Sans Frontieres:** Veerman is a speaker *from* Medecines Sans Frontieres, but he's talking about Angola's situation, not the organization itself.
*   **C: Mangola:** Mangola is mentioned as the location where the outbreak is, but Veerman specifically says the situation is bad *in Angola*.
*   **D: World Health Organization:**  The WHO is mentioned along with other organizations responding to the outbreak, but Veerman isn't saying the WHO's situation is bad.



"
"Ka lebaka la qoso, ke mang ya tla nka boemo ba Khabinete ya Huhne?","The correct answer is **A: Davey**.

The text states: ""Huhne o itokolotse mme o tla nkelwa sebaka Khabineteng ke Ed Davey MP."" (Huhne resigned and will be replaced in the Cabinet by Ed Davey MP.)"
Ke mang ya tla nka karolo ya Letona la Kgwebo ka mora qoso?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Norman Lamb MP o lebeletswe ho nka mosebetsi wa Letona la Kgwebo oo Davey a tswang ho wona."" This translates to ""Norman Lamb MP is expected to take the position of Secretary of State for Business which Davey is leaving.""

Therefore, Norman Lamb is the one taking over the role."
Dibini kapa diletsi ba kgothalletsa bamamedi ho etsa eng nakong ya opera ya Camille Saint-Saens?,"The correct answer is **A: Kenya letsoho tshebedisong ya cannabis**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""theaters themselves encourage the audience to do so as well"" referring to the actors smoking cigarettes on stage (which are implied to contain cannabis based on the description of the opera's subject matter).  The question asks what the actors/theater encourage the audience to do. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nka leeto la ho ya Japane** - While the opera's subject is fascinated by Japan, the passage doesn't suggest the audience should travel there.
* **C: Ho tla sethaleng bakeng sa ho bina le bona** - The passage doesn't mention anything about dancing.
* **D: Dumella bophelo ba bona hore bo laolwe ke seo ba se ratang** - This is a very broad interpretation of the opera's theme and isn't directly stated as something the theater encourages.



"
Ke mang ya tsubang matekwane nakong ya opera?,"The correct answer is **C: Dibini le diletsi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ka lebaka lena, **dibapadi di tsuba dizolo tsa matekwane** sethaleng..."" (Because of this, **the performers smoke cigarettes** on stage...).  ""Dibapadi"" refers to the performers (actors/singers) in the opera.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sebini** - While a singer is a performer, the text says ""dibapadi"" (performers) generally, not just the singer.
*   **B: Bamamedi ba Mafora** - This translates to ""French spectators."" The text states they are *encouraged* to smoke, but it's the performers who *do* smoke.
*   **D: Camille Saint-Saens** - He is the composer of the opera, not someone smoking on stage.



"
"""Lebitso le leng la """"ho tsamaya sepakapakeng"""" ha Leonov ke lefe?""","The correct answer is **C: Tshebetso ya kantle**.

Here's why:

* The passage states Leonov performed """"extravehicular activity"""" (EVA), *kapa* """"ho tsamaya sepakapakeng"""", *moo a bileng mong kantle ho lefaufau...*.  ""Tshebetso ya kantle"" is the Sesotho translation of ""extravehicular activity"" or ""space walk.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Leeto la Apollo-Soyuz:** This was a mission Leonov *led* later in his career, not the term for space walking itself.
* **B: Peiso ya Sebakeng:** This isn't mentioned in the text and doesn't relate to space walking.
* **D: Cosmonaut No. 11:** This is a designation given *to* Leonov, not the activity he performed.



"
Leonov o ile a etella pele karolo ya Soviet ya leeto lefe?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo–Soyuz**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ka dilemo tse leshome ha morao, o eteletse pele karolo ya Soviet ya leeto la Apollo–Soyuz..."" (Ten years later, he led the Soviet part of the Apollo–Soyuz mission...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lebelo la Sebakeng** (Space Race) - While relevant to the context, it's not the *specific mission* Leonov led.
*   **C: Cosmonaut No. 11** - This is a designation, not a mission.
*   **D: EVA** - This is a type of activity (spacewalk), not a mission.



"
Ke mang ya lemetseng kotsing eo?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibson**.

The text states: ""Gibson o nketswe sepetlele empa a shwa nakwana kamora moo."" (Gibson was taken to the hospital but died shortly after). This means Gibson was injured and ultimately died in the accident.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mosebetsi wa karatjhe (The person working at the shop)** - The text says they witnessed the accident and heard the children, but doesn't state they were injured.
*   **C: Bana (The children)** - The text says they *escaped* the scene.
*   **D: Mokganni wa teraka (The truck driver)** - The text states: ""Moqhobi wa lori, ya dilemo tse 64, ha a lemala kotsing ena."" (The 64-year-old truck driver was not injured in this accident.)"
Ho ile ha etsahalang ka batho ba amehileng kotsing eo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka bobedi ba ile shwa**.

Here's why:

* The text states Gibson was taken to the hospital but died shortly after.
* The text also states the truck driver was not injured, meaning he did not die. 

Therefore, only Gibson died, but the question asks about *both* people involved. The text does not mention the fate of the children who were nearby, just that they escaped.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: E mong o ne a sa tswa kotsi, e mong a hlokahala** - This is partially true (the driver was unharmed), but Gibson *did* die, so it's not accurate.
* **C: Ba ne ba hweletsa ba lla** - This refers to the children, not the people *in* the accident.
* **D: Ka bobedi ba ile ba tswa dikotsi** -  Gibson died, so this is incorrect.



"
Bo-rasaense ba sebetsang lenaneong lena ba ne ba tshepile ho bona diphello tse bakilweng ke efe ho tse latelang?,"The correct answer is **D: Ntho e lefifi (Dark matter)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the research aimed to understand the interaction between the dark matter of the Sagittarius galaxy and the Milky Way's dark matter. The scientists were trying to confirm that dark matter interacts with other dark matter similarly to how regular matter does.  They wanted to understand the structure of dark matter - whether it forms a halo of many smaller particles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Taba ya kamehla (Regular matter):** While the analogy to tides is used with the Moon and Earth (regular matter), the research *focused* on dark matter interaction.
*   **B: Matla a maqhubu (Forces):**  The passage mentions tidal *forces*, but the primary goal wasn't to study the forces themselves, but how dark matter responds to them.
*   **C: Dikarolwana tse nyane (Small particles):** This is *a result* they hoped to find evidence for (the structure of dark matter), but not what they were directly hoping to *see the effects of*. They were hoping to see effects that would *confirm* the existence of these particles and how they interact.



"
Bo-rasaense ba ne ba hlokometse ntho ya efe ho tse latelang?,"The correct answer is **C: Lefatshe le Kgwedi**.

Here's why:

The passage uses the example of the Earth and Moon to explain the tidal forces between the Milky Way and the Sagittarius galaxy. It states, ""Just as the moon has gravitational pull on Earth, causing tides, similarly the Milky Way has gravitational pull on the Sagittarius galaxy."" This direct comparison makes Earth and the Moon the phenomenon being observed for understanding the larger galactic interaction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Molala le Kgwedi:** The passage doesn't mention ""Molala"" (which likely translates to 'Milky Way' in Sesotho).
*   **B: Lefatshe le sehlopha sa dinaledi sa Sagittarius:** While Sagittarius is mentioned, the Earth is used as part of the *example* to explain the forces at play, not the primary focus of the observation.
*   **D: Sehlopha sa dinaledi sa Sagittarius le Molala:** Again, ""Molala"" isn't a specifically highlighted observed relationship in the passage."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e sa nyatsweng ke batho dingangele?","The correct answer is **C: Ke mang ya fuwang dikonteraka tsa kaho botjha**

Here's why:

The passage states that liberals are focusing on ""dima kabo ya dikonteraka tsa kahobotjha ho ba bonweng jwalo ka bo-metlakgola ba Washington."" This translates to concerns about *who* was awarded the rebuilding contracts, implying a suspicion of corruption or favoritism (""Washington insiders""). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tjhelete ya diphallelo** - The passage mentions money used for relief, but doesn't say people are criticizing the relief funds themselves.
*   **B: Kgaello ya boiteko ba kaho botjha** - The passage doesn't discuss a lack of effort in rebuilding, only *who* is doing the rebuilding.
*   **D: Tjhelete ya ho haha botjha** - Like option A, the passage talks about the use of funds, but the criticism isn't aimed at the amount of money for rebuilding, but who benefitted from it.



"
Ke mang ya nyatsang dikonteraka tsa kaho botjha bakeng sa boiteko ba diphallelo ba Lehodiotswana Katrina?,"The correct answer is **B: Batho ba dikelello di bulehileng**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Tshehollo ya boliberale ya mohato wa kahobotjha o tsepamisitse maikutlo ho dima kabo ya dikonteraka tsa kahobotjha ho ba bonweng jwalo ka bo-metlakgola ba Washington."" This directly translates to ""The liberal opposition focused on the awarding of reconstruction contracts to those seen as Washington insiders.""  This means people with liberal beliefs (those of a ""boliberale"" leaning) are criticizing the contracts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ba bolokang tsa tjhelete:** While the passage mentions financial concerns, it doesn't say they are the ones criticizing the contracts. They are being *discussed* in relation to the financial aspect.
*   **C: Bush:** The passage refers to criticism *of* ""Bush's New Orleans Deal,"" but it doesn't say Bush himself is criticizing the contracts.
*   **D: Batho ba ka hara Washington:** These are the *targets* of the criticism (the people receiving the contracts), not the ones doing the criticizing.

"Ho latela seratswana, mabone a tswang sefofa-sebakeng sa Stardust a tla bonahala hokae pele?","The correct answer is **B: California Leboya**.

The text states: ""Khepsule ena e tla shebeha jwalo ka naledi e tsubellang e parola sepakapaka. E tla fofa hodima lebopo le ka bophirima la California Leboya..."" This clearly indicates that the light from Stardust will be visible *over* Northern California first.

While the light will be visible in other states, California Leboya is where it will initially appear.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, sefofa-sebakeng se tla beha rekoto bakeng sa efe ho tse latelang?","The correct answer is **C: Ho kgutlela Lefatsheng kapele** (Returning to Earth quickly).

The text explicitly states: ""Stardust e tla teka rekoto ya nako yohle bakeng sa ho ba rokete e lebelo ka ho fetisisa e kgutlelang Lefatsheng"" which translates to ""Stardust will take the all-time record for being the fastest rocket returning to Earth.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho kgantsha lehodimo ka bophara** (Crossing the sky widely): While it will be visible across a wide area, that's not the record it's breaking.
*   **B: Ho bonahala metseng e mengata** (Being visible in many cities):  The text mentions visibility, but not as the focus of a record.
*   **D: Ho tsamaya ka potlako ho tloha San Francisco ho ya Los Angeles** (Traveling quickly from San Francisco to Los Angeles): The text *uses* this as a comparison to illustrate its speed, but the record isn’t for that specific trip.



"
Ngaka Malar Balasubramanian o ne a amana jwang le Saroja Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **C: Mme**.

The text states: ""Teng, ba fumana setopo sa Saroja Balasubramanian, 53, se phuthetsweng ka dikobo tse madi."" followed by ""Ngaka Malar Balasubramanian, ya dilemo tse 29..."". This clearly indicates that Saroja Balasubramanian was the mother of Dr. Malar Balasubramanian."
Setopo sa Sara Balasubramanian se fumanwe hokae?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka kutu ya koloi**.

The text states: ""Teng, ba fumana setopo sa Saroja Balasubramanian, 53, se phuthetsweng ka dikobo tse madi **ka kutu ya koloi ya hae e ntsho**."" (There, they found the body of Saroja Balasubramanian, 53, mutilated with knives **in her black car**).



"
Ke eng e rekilweng ke eBay?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

The passage states that eBay is looking to diversify its revenue streams and gain prominence in areas where **Skype** has a strong presence. This implies eBay *acquired* Skype.



"
eBay e batla ho fihlela eng ka ho reka?,"The correct answer is **B: Ho atolohela dibakeng tse ntjha**.

Here's why:

The passage states eBay ""trusts that diversifying its revenue streams and gaining traction in areas where Skype is strong, such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil"" is a key goal. This directly relates to **expanding into new markets** (ho atolohela dibakeng tse ntjha).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kopanya tjhelete ya yona (Consolidate its funds):** The passage doesn't mention consolidating funds.
* **C: Phahamisa boemo ba yona (Raise its status):** While expanding could *lead* to a higher status, the passage focuses on the *how* (expansion into new markets) rather than the ultimate status gain.
* **D: Kgotsofatsa boradiabo ba yona (Satisfy its radiance):** This doesn't make sense in the context of a business strategy.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke mang ya sa kang a sebedisana le batshwaruwa ba ileng ba sala ka jareteng ka mora ntwa?","The correct answer is **D: Basebetsi ba sepetlele**.

Here's why:

The text states the prisoners were taken to the *hospital* after the shootout. It then details negotiations with the remaining prisoners at the house, and the response of officers and firefighters. There's no mention of hospital staff interacting with the prisoners after they were initially brought there.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ba dipuisano (Negotiators):** The text explicitly says negotiators *tried* to resolve the situation.
*   **B: Basebetsi ba pholoso ba mollo (Firefighters):** Firefighters were involved in extinguishing the fire set by the prisoners.
*   **C: Diofisiri (Officers):** Officers directly engaged with the prisoners by using tear gas.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e ileng ya qetella e entse hore batshwaruwa ba ikhule moferefereng oo?,"The correct answer is **B: Kgase e llisang (Tear gas)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that officers ""subdued the inmates by deploying tear gas."" This directly caused the end of the standoff. While the fire (D) was a major event, it happened *after* the inmates were already being subdued. The other options aren't mentioned as contributing to ending the situation.
"
"Ka maikutlo a Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, naha ya Iran e lokela ho itokolla ho eng?","The correct answer is **D: Ho itshetleha ka oli** (Reliance on oil).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, o hlalositse boitshetleho hodima oli jwalo ka """"leraba"""" le qadileng haesale ho tloha pele ho phetolo ya mmuso ya Puso ya Islam ya Iran ka 1979 mme leo naha e lokelang ho itshwasolla ho lona.""  This directly translates to him describing oil dependence as a ""trap"" and stating the country needs to *free itself from it*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dithibelong tsa ditjhelete** (Economic sanctions) - While sanctions are a problem *related* to the oil issue, Khamenei doesn't say Iran needs to free itself from sanctions.
*   **B: Phetohelong ya Bo-Islamo** (Islamic Revolution) - The passage mentions the revolution as a historical point, but it's not what Khamenei wants Iran to free itself from.
*   **C: Tjhelete ya kantle ho naha** (Foreign currency) -  Reliance on foreign currency is a *consequence* of the oil situation, not the core issue Khamenei identifies.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang ya amohetseng ditlamorao tsa kotlo moruong wa Iran?","The correct answer is **A: Mehlodi e phahameng (High ranks)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...e ne e le lekgetlo la pele **mehlodi e phahameng ya Iran** e amohetseng hore dikotlo di ba le tshwaelo ya letho.""  This directly translates to ""...it was the first time **high-ranking officials in Iran** admitted that sanctions were having an economic impact.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: OPEC:** While OPEC notes the falling oil production, they aren't *experiencing* the impact of the sanctions directly.
* **C: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei:** He acknowledges the reliance on oil as a problem, but he isn’t the one *feeling* the impact of the sanctions initially.
* **D: European Union:** The EU *imposes* sanctions, they don't *experience* their impact on the Iranian economy.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo e seng karolo ya tshebetso ya ho vouta ya Fora?,"The correct answer is **A: Mabokose a ho vouta a pepeneneng** (Transparent ballot boxes).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that since 1988, ballot boxes *must* be transparent (bonaletseha) so that voters can see they are empty at the start and that no unauthorized envelopes are added.  This makes transparent ballot boxes a *requirement* of the process, not something *not* a part of it.

Let's look at why the other options *are* part of the process:

*   **B: Baemedi ba rometsweng ke bokgethi** (Representatives sent by the party): The passage says parties send representatives to witness each step.
*   **C: Ho saena lenane la dikgetho** (Signing the voter roll):  The passage mentions voters sign a roll after their information is verified.
*   **D: Dikgetho di balwa ke baithaopi tlasa bodisa bo matla** (Votes are counted by officials under strict supervision): The passage states votes are counted by officials with established procedures.



"
Bakgethi ba bontsha mokgethwa owu bona hokae?,"The correct answer is **C: Hodima enfelopo**.

The passage states: ""bakgethi ba itsheka ho kena ka hara di-booth, ba tshele pampitshana e seng e hatisitswe e bontshang mokgethwa wa bona ka **enfelopong**."" (voters identify themselves by filling out a blank ballot showing their preference on an **envelope**).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lethathamong la dikgetho** - The passage doesn't mention preferences being shown on the voter roll.
*   **B: Leqepheng le hatisitsweng esale pele** - The ballot itself is blank to start.
*   **D: Motjhineng o ka hare ho lephephe** - The preference is marked on the envelope, not inside the ballot box.



"
Ke eng e entseng hore Allen a qale ho batlana le Musashi ka dilemo tse robedi?,"The correct answer is **D: Thahasello ya hae ntweng** (His interest in the war).

The passage states: ""...a qala mekutu ya hae ya ho fumana Musashi ka ha ka nako e telele o ne a kgahlehela ntwa eo."" This directly translates to ""...he started his search for Musashi because for a long time he was fascinated by the war.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Leruo la hae** (His wealth) - While he *used* his wealth to fund the searches, it wasn't the initial reason he started.
* **B: Thahasello ya hae ho mmapa wa lewatle** (His interest in the sea map) - The sea map was a *result* of the search, not the initial cause.
* **C: Letsete la hae la dipatlisiso tsa metsing** (His funding of underwater research) - Similar to wealth, this enabled the search but wasn't the driving force behind it.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, Allen o sebedisitse tjhelete e ngata ho eng?","The correct answer is **A: Ho tsosolosa Musashi** (Salvaging the Musashi).

Here's why:

The passage states ""Allen ho bolelwa a tsetetse boholo ba leruo la hae ditshibollong tsa lewatleng mme a qala mekutu ya hae ya ho fumana Musashi ka ha ka nako e telele o ne a kgahlehela ntwa eo."" This directly translates to ""Allen is said to have invested a large portion of his wealth in underwater expeditions and began his search for the Musashi because he had long been fascinated by the battle.""  The entire passage revolves around Allen's efforts to find and now potentially salvage the Musashi.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Patlisiso ya metsing** (Underwater research) - While his efforts *involved* underwater research, the ultimate goal was Musashi.
*   **C: Ho theha ROV** (Creating the ROV) - The ROV was a *tool* used in the search, not the primary investment.
*   **D: Ho ithuta ka mmapa wa katlase wa leoatle** (Studying ocean maps) -  The map was a starting point, but not what the majority of his money went into.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e ka nnang ya ba e lebisitse maemong a kotsi ka hara semela le ho se potoloha?","The correct answer is **A: Mafura a Uranium**.

Here's why:

The passage states that scientists *hypothesize* the radioactive caesium and iodine were released because ""fuel rods containing uranium have likely melted and are leaking."" This implies the uranium fuel rods are the root cause of the dangerous situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Cesium ya mahlasedi (Radioactive Cesium):** Caesium is a *result* of the problem, not the cause. It's a substance released *because* of the fuel rod issue.
*   **C: Mosi o mosweu (White smoke):** The white smoke is a *symptom* of the problem, an observation. It doesn’t cause the problem.
*   **D: Iodine:** Similar to caesium, iodine is a *released substance*, not the initiating factor.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo e seng e nngwe ya dikeletso tsa polokeho tse kgothaleditsweng ho baahi ba lehae ho latela ketsahalo e etsahetseng femeng?,"The correct answer is **A: Qoba ho sebedisa di-yuniti tsa air conditioning**.

Here's why:

The passage states the following safety recommendations were made to local residents:

*   **Dula ka matlung (Stay indoors)**
*   **Time difehli tsa moya (Close windows)**
*   **Qoba ho nwa metsi a pompo (Do not drink well water)**

It does *not* mention anything about avoiding air conditioning.

Therefore, avoiding air conditioning is not one of the safety recommendations from the passage."
"Ho ya ka Dr. Moll, ke eng e tshwenyang haholo ka XDR-TB?","The correct answer is **D: Ke sekgahla se phahameng sa batho ba shwang** (The high mortality rate).

Here's why:

The text states Dr. Moll was ""greatly moved and frightened by the extremely high mortality rate"" of this new strain. While the other options are mentioned in the text, the doctor specifically highlights the *mortality rate* as the most concerning aspect.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bolwetse bo fumanwa sepetlele** (The disease is found in the hospital) - While it's concerning that it was found in the hospital, the text doesn't present this as the primary concern.
*   **B: Mofuta o fapaneng wa ho hanyetsa dithethefatsi** (A different type of drug resistance) - This is a characteristic of XDR-TB, but not what *worries* Dr. Moll the most.
*   **C: Bongata ba batho bao motho ya tshwaeditsweng a ka ba tshwaetsang** (The number of people one infected person can infect) - This is a significant factor in spread, but again, the text specifically states the *mortality rate* was what frightened the doctor.



"
Ke bakudi ba bakae ba tshwaeditsweng ke mofuta o motjha o fapaneng ba netefaditsweng hore ke basebeletsi ba tsa bophelo bo botle?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The text states: ""bonyane ba babedi ba bona e ne e le basebetsi ba bophelo ba sepetlele."" (at least two of them were hospital healthcare workers). 

Therefore, the answer is 2."
Sistimi ya NextGen e sebedisa theknoloji ya mofuta ofe?,"The correct answer is **A: Theknoloji e thehilweng ho sathelaete**.

The passage clearly states: ""E sebedisa bothekenoloji ba sathalaete ho fapana le bothekenoloji ba fatshe ba radar..."" which means it uses satellite technology."
NextGen e thusa balaodi ba sephethephethe sa sefofane ka kotloloho jwang?,"The correct answer is **B: Dibaka tse nepahetseng haholwanyane tsa difofane.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that NextGen ""allows air traffic controllers to accurately track aircraft and for pilots to receive more accurate information."" This directly translates to more accurate aircraft positions.

Let's look at why the other options are less direct answers:

*   **A: Ditsela tse khutshwane tsa ho fofa** - While NextGen *can* lead to shorter routes, the passage doesn't emphasize this as a *direct* help to controllers.
*   **C: Ho fokotseha ha khabone** - This is a benefit of NextGen, but not how it *directly* helps controllers.
*   **D: Mafura a fokolang** -  Similar to C, this is a positive outcome, not a direct assistance to controllers.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, bo-rahistori ha baa ka ba nyatsa FBI ka ho tsepamisa maikutlo ho eng?","The correct answer is **B: Ho abela disebediswa ho ditlolo tsa molao tse ka rarollwang habonolo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that historians criticized the FBI for focusing on ""easy-to-solve cases,"" specifically mentioning auto theft. This implies they believed resources were being allocated to cases that were simple to crack, rather than more challenging or significant crimes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho matlafatsa sekhahla sa katleho ya bona** - While the FBI aimed to *increase* their success rate, the historians *criticized* the way they were going about it.
*   **C: Ho tsepamisa maikutlo haholo ditabeng tsa ditshwantsho tsa bootswa** - The passage mentions this as a separate request from the House Judiciary Committee, not the focus of the initial criticism.
*   **D: Dinyewe tsa koloi tse utswitsweng** - Auto theft is used as an *example* of the type of easy case the FBI was focusing on, not the core of the criticism.



"
Boikemisetso ba manyala bo qobella FBI ho etsa eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Baemedi ba inehetseng dinyeweng tsa ditshwantsho tsa bootswa**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the House Judiciary Committee specifically required the FBI to **assign 10 agents to focus on child pornography cases**. This direct assignment is the core of the commitment made in response to the initiative.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the initiative aims to improve success rates for simpler crimes *including* auto theft, the commitment itself is about allocating agents to child pornography.
*   **B:** Strengthening the success rate is a *goal* of the initiative, not the specific commitment demanded by the House committee.
*   **C:** Focusing on easily solvable crimes is part of the broader strategy, but the assigned agents are specifically for child pornography.



"
Ho etsahetseng ka koloi ya mollo e ileng ya arabela kotsing ya JAS 39C Gripen? ,"The correct answer is **C: E ile ya phatloha**.

The text states: ""Mofofisi o tsebahaditswe ka hore ke Moetapele wa Squadron Dilokrit Pattavee. Ditlaleho tsa masedinyana a lehae di re setima-mollo sa boemafofane se ile sa phethoha ha sene se phallela koduwa ena."" which translates to ""The officer was informed that it was Squadron Leader Dilokrit Pattavee. Local reports state that the fire truck's engine completed when it was approaching this code.""

This implies the fire truck's engine *failed* or *broke down* while responding to the incident.  ""Phatloha"" means to break down or fail.



"
"Ka mora ho wa ha JAS 39C Gripen, boema-fofane bo ile ba kwallwa ho eng?","The correct answer is **A: Difofane tsa kgwebo** (Commercial aircraft).

The text states the crash led to the ""kwalwa ha boemafofane bakeng sa difofane tsa baeti"" which translates to ""cancellation of flights for passenger planes/commercial aircraft.""
"
Brzezinski o ile a fana ka tataiso ho mang nakong ya Phetohelo ya Iran?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

The passage states: ""Jwalo ka NSA, o thusitse Carter ho sebetsana le ditaba tsa bodiplomate tsa lefatshe, jwalo ka ... Phetolo ya Puso ya Iran..."" which directly indicates Brzezinski advised Carter during the Iranian Revolution."
Ke mang ya ileng a tshwara boemo ba Moeletsi wa Tshireletso ya Setjhaba ho fihlela ka-1977?,"The correct answer is **B: Kissinger**.

The text states that Brzezinski *replaced* Henry Kissinger as National Security Advisor in 1977. This means Kissinger held the position *until* 1977."
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa bontsheng hantle mosebetsi wa Bobek le Partizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **A: O ile a kora ka makgetlo a fetang 468 ha a ntse a bapalla sehlopha**.

Here's why:

*   The text states Bobek played in 468 matches. It doesn't say how many times he *attempted* to score, only that he scored in those 468 matches.
*   The other options are directly supported by the text:
    *   **B:** He scored more than any other player.
    *   **C:** He was voted the greatest player in Partizan's history.
    *   **D:** He scored more goals than any other player.

Therefore, option A presents information not found in the text, and is thus the answer."
Ke polelo efe ka nalane ya Bobek le Partizan Belgrade eo e leng nnete?,"The correct answer is **A: O qadile ho bapalla Partizan ka-1945**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""O se kenetse ka 1945 mme a ba ho sona ho fihlela ka 1958."" (He joined in 1945 and stayed until 1958.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: O ile a bapalla Zagreb pele ho Partizan Belgrade** - While the passage says he's ""ya hlahetseng motsemoholo wa Croatia, Zagreb"" (born in the capital of Croatia, Zagreb), it doesn't say he *played* for Zagreb before Partizan.
* **C: O ile a bapalla Partizan ho fihlela ka-1995** - The passage states he played until 1958, not 1995.  He was *honored* in 1995, but that's different than playing.
* **D: O ile a fumana botumo ka mora ho kgethwa e le sebapadi se hlwahlwa sa Partizan** - He gained fame *because* of his playing record, and the honor in 1995 *recognized* his fame, but he wasn't famous *after* being named the greatest player. He was already legendary.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke tshobotsi efe e kgethollang Hesperonychus ho Velociraptor?","The correct answer is **B: E na le lenala la bobedi le leholwanyane** (It has a small second claw).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...e na le dinala jwalo ka a Velociraptor. Dinala tsa yona tse kamorao di kgolwanyane, e leng se di fang lebitso la Hesperonychus le bolelang """"dinala tsa bophirima."""" (…it had claws like those of Velociraptor. Its rear claws were small, which gave it the name Hesperonychus meaning """"western claws.""""). This specifically highlights the *small second claw* as a distinguishing feature.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E na le maoto a mabedi** (It has two legs) - The text says it *was believed* to walk on two legs, and Velociraptor also walked on two legs, so this isn't a distinguishing feature.
*   **C: E na le mmele o masiba ka botlalo** (It has a fully feathered body) - While it's stated it had feathers, this doesn't distinguish it from Velociraptor, as it's common knowledge many dinosaurs had feathers.
*   **D: E futhumetse madi** (It warmed its eggs) - This is a general characteristic of dinosaurs and doesn't uniquely define Hesperonychus.



"
"""Moelelo wa """"Hesperonychus"""" o tswa ho sebopeho sefe sa mmele wa mofuta oo?""","The correct answer is **A: Dinala**.

The passage states: ""Dinala tsa yona tse kamorao di kgolwanyane, e leng se di fang lebitso la Hesperonychus le bolelang """"dinala tsa bophirima."""" "" This directly translates to ""Its hind claws were small, which gave it the name Hesperonychus meaning """"western claws."""" 

Therefore, the name ""Hesperonychus"" comes from the shape of its claws."
Ke efe ho tse latelang tse mabapi le ho thunya eo e leng nnete?,"The correct answer is **D: Ho thunngwa ho etsahetse Buffalo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states ""ho thunngwa ho etsahetse Buffalo"" (the shooting happened in Buffalo).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Monna le mosadi ba ne ba tswa Texas ka bobedi** - The passage only says they got married in Texas, not that they are *from* Texas.
*   **B: Ho ne ho e-na le bahlaseduwa ba bahlano** - The passage says four people were killed.
*   **C: Banyalani bana ba nyalane selemo pele ho Buffalo** - They got married a year ago, but the marriage took place in Texas, not Buffalo. They came *to* Buffalo to celebrate.



"
Ke polelo efe e nepahetseng mabapi le ketsahalo eo ho thunngwa ho etsahetseng ho yona?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho etsahetse moketeng wa sehopotso Buffalo**.

Here's why:

* The text states ""Bonyane batho ba 100 ba kenetse moketjana, e leho keteka sehopotso sa selemo sa pele..."" meaning a party for the anniversary was happening.
* It specifically mentions the shooting occurred at this party in Buffalo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ho etsahetse ketsahalong e hlophisitsweng ya sehopotso:** While there *was* a planned event, the shooting happened at the *party* itself, not just the planned event as a whole.
* **C: Ho etsahetse moketeng wa Texas:** The couple got married in Texas, but the party/shooting happened in Buffalo.
* **D: Ho etsahetse letjhatong la banyalani bao:** The text doesn’t mention the shooting happened at the couple's home.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, qalong ke ho tshwenyeha hofe hoo diofisiri di neng di na le hona ka Luno?","The correct answer is **A: Kgaello ya tlwaelo ya manyolo** (Loss of the usual cargo of manganese).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""qalong baofisiri ba ne ba tshohile hore sekepe se ka qhala morwalo ona."" This translates to ""initially, officers were worried that the ship would miss its usual cargo of manganese."" 

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Maqhubu le meya e matla** - These were *results* of the ship breaking up, not the initial concern.
*   **C: Ho qhalana ha mafura** - The oil spill happened *because* the ship broke up, it wasn't the initial worry.
*   **D: Dikotsi tse ka bang teng ho ditho tsa basebetsi** - While the crew's safety was a concern *after* the breakup, the initial worry was about the cargo.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ya dipolelo tse latelang mabapi le ho senyeha ha Luno eo e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **B: Sekepe se ne se e-na le mafura a dimithara tse-100 ka hara sekepe nakong ya ho senyeha**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the ship was carrying **120-160 meters of oil** when it sank, not 100 meters.

Let's look at why the other options are true:

*   **A: Ho senyeha ho etsahetse pele ho nka tlwaelo** – The text mentions the ship was on its ""regular route"" for collecting ore, implying it was a routine voyage.
*   **C: Ho ditho tse leshome le metso e mmedi tsa basebetsi, a le mong o ile a tswa kotsi** – The passage states 12 crew members were rescued and *one person was missing*, therefore was injured/lost.
*   **D: Sekepe se ile sa sutumelletswa ka hara metsi a phunyeletsang** – The text says ""strong winds and waves pushed it towards the water"", meaning it was forced/driven into the water.



"
Algeria e fumane boipuso ka dilemo dife tse leshome?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka bo 1960**.

The passage states that Vautier returned to ""naheng e neng e sa tswa fumana boipuso ya Algeria"" (the newly independent country of Algeria) in the 1960s. This directly implies Algeria gained independence in the 1960s.
"
Ke hokae moo dithelevishene di neng di sa lokisetswa tshebeletso ya lepato?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho pholletsa le Roma**.

The passage states that several large screens were set up *in various locations in Rome* to allow people to view the canonization because the crowds were too large to fit in St. Peter's Square. This implies that not all areas of Rome had access to a direct view or screens for the event.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Metseng e fapaneng ya Italy:** The passage mentions similar events in Italy *and Poland*, but doesn't say screens were needed in other Italian cities.
*   **C: Dibakeng tse ding tsa Poland:** Poland had *similar events*, not a lack of access to the broadcast.
*   **D: Sebakeng sa St. Peter's Square:** The passage explicitly says people couldn't *all* fit in St. Peter's Square, therefore the problem wasn't a lack of screens *in* the square, but a need for overflow viewing areas.



"
Tshebeletso ya lepato e ne e tshwaretswe hokae?,"The correct answer is **A: Dibakeng tse sa tshwaneng ho pholletsa le Roma**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Disekerine tse mmalwa tse kgolo di ile tsa kenngwa **dibakeng tse fapafapaneng Roma** ho dumella batho ho ka boha tshebeletso ena."" This directly answers the question about where the service was held.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Poland** - Poland is mentioned as having *similar* initiatives, but not as a location for *this* specific service.
*   **C: Sebakeng sa St. Peter's Square** - The text states the crowd was too large for *everyone* to fit in St. Peter's Square, meaning the service wasn't *only* there.
*   **D: Ya pele e ne e le Roma, e ntano ba motseng o mong wa Italy** - The text only specifies multiple locations *within* Rome, not moving to another Italian town.



"
"Ka mora ho phatloha hoo, ke mang ya ileng a phekolwa dikotsi tse mpe?","The correct answer is **A: Bonyane batho ba bahlano**.

The text states: ""Ha ho dikotsi tse kgolo tse tlalehilweng, empa bonyane batho ba bahlano ba neng ba le sebakeng sena ka nako ya ho phatloha ba alafetswe matshwao a ho kula a tsitsipano ya mmele."" This means at least five people were injured.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ha ho motho** - The text specifically says five people were injured.
* **C: Ofisiri ya khamphani ya kgase** - The text doesn't mention the gas company officer being injured.
* **D: Moahelani** - The text only states the caller alerted the gas company, it doesn't say they were injured.



"
Ke mang ya tlalehileng ho dutla ha kgase?,"The correct answer is **A: Moahelani mohahong** (The resident).

The text states: ""Moofisiri ya sebeletsang khampani ya kgase o ne a ya sebakeng sa kotsi kamora hore **moahisani** a mo letsetse mabapi le ho dutla ha kgase."" This directly translates to ""The gas company officer went to the dangerous area after the **resident** called him about the gas leak.""
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke batho ba bakae ba shweleng tlhaselong eo?","The correct answer is **B: 2**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Batho ba hlokahetseng e bile Nicholas Alden, 25, le Zachary Cuddeback, 21."" This directly says two people were killed (hlokahetseng means ""were killed"" or ""died""). 

The others mentioned (Edgar Veguilla, Kristoffer Schneider) were injured, but not killed. The mention of a fifth person being struck in the head doesn't confirm a fatality, just an injury.
"
Ke sebetsa sa mang se hlolehileng ho thunya ka nako e nngwe nakong ya tlhaselo?,"The correct answer is **B: Uka**.

The text states: ""Sebetsa sa Uka se hlolehile ha se ne se supile monna wa bohlano hloohong."" This directly translates to ""Uka's operation failed when it punctured the fifth man's head."" 

Therefore, Uka's operation is the one that failed during the attack."
Ke dipapadi dife ho tse latelang tse ntshitsweng ho tswa lenaneong la diolimpiki?,"The correct answer is **C: Baseball**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sekwashe, karate le dipapadi tsa thelliso tsa di-roller di lekile ho kena lenaneong la Diolimpiki mmoho le beisebolo le softball, mme bobedi di voutetswe ho ntshwa Dipapading tsa Diolimpiki ka 2005."" This clearly indicates that baseball (beisebolo) was removed from the Olympic program in 2005.
"
Ke dipapadi dife ho tse latelang tseo Komiti ya Matjhaba ya Diolimpiki e ileng ya kgetha ho di kenyelletsa dipapading?,"The correct answer is **C: Yunione ea rugby**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Rakbi, haholoholo yunione ya rakbi, le kolofo di kgethilwe kahara dipapadi tse ding tse hlano hore di sekasekelwe ho nka karolo Diolimpiking."" This directly says rugby (specifically union rugby) was chosen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dipapadi tsa thelliso tsa Rollers:** The text states these *failed* to be included.
*   **B: Baseball:** The text states baseball was *removed* from the Olympics in 2005.
*   **D: Softball:** Similar to baseball, softball was *removed* in 2005."
Qalong Arthur Guinness o ile a hira St James' Gate Brewery ka dilemo tse kae?,"The correct answer is **D: 9000**.

The passage states Arthur Guinness signed a lease of **9,000 years** for St James' Gate Brewery. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 250** - This refers to the number of years *later* that Guinness became a global company.
*   **B: 10** - This is not a number mentioned in relation to the lease.
*   **C: 1759** - This is the *year* he signed the lease, not the length of it."
Guinness e tlisa bonyane didolara tse dibilione tse kae selemo le selemo?,"The correct answer is **C: 14**.

The text states Guinness generates over 10 billion euros per year, which is equivalent to US$14.7 billion. The question asks for the *minimum* number of billions of dollars, so 14 is the correct answer."
Ke dinaheng tse kae tsa European Union moo kokwana-hloko ya H5N1 e fumanweng?,"The correct answer is **C: Supa**.

Here's why:

The text states that France is the *seventh* EU country to confirm the H5N1 virus. It then lists the six countries before France: Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Italy.  Therefore, a total of seven countries have confirmed cases. However, the question asks how many countries have the virus and France is the seventh to report it.

Therefore, the answer is seven or ""supa"" in Setswana.



"
Morao-rao ya kokwana-hloko ya H5N1 e fumanwe hokae?,"The correct answer is **A: Fora**.

The text states: ""...o netefaditswe hore o tshwaeditse letata la naha le shweleng, lefumanweng ka Mantaha, mokgwabong o haufi le Lyon ka botjhabela ba Fora."" ( ""...was confirmed to have infected a wild bird, found on Monday, in a farm near Lyon in eastern **France**."")



"
Haiti e qetetse neng ho kopana le lefu lena pele ho ho nama ho bakilweng ke balebedi ba kgotso?,"The correct answer is **A: Dilemong tsa bo-1800**.

The text states: ""Pele ho fihla mabotho, Haiti e ne eso ka eba le mathata a amanang le bolwetse ho tloha dilemong tsa bo-1800."" This directly answers the question of when Haiti first encountered the disease before the outbreak linked to the peacekeepers.



"
Ditshila tse tswang sebakeng sefe tse tlatseditseng ho jaleheng ha lefu lena?,"The correct answer is **B: Kampo ya UN**.

The passage states: ""Ho ya ka nyewe, ditshila tse tswang kampong ya UN ha di ya tsamaiswa hantle, ho bakileng hore dikokwana-hloko di kene nokaneng ya Noka ya Artibonite..."" This directly links the waste from the UN camp to the outbreak.

While the cholera did end up in the Artibonite River (A), the *source* of the contamination was the UN camp's waste.



"
Mmuso wa Ireland o rera ho etsang?,"The correct answer is **B: Hlahisa melao e thata ho feta ya tumello ya dithethefatsi**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Irish government is passing legislation to ""correct"" a situation, and the Minister for Health highlighted concerns about people taking advantage of allowances related to controlled substances.  This indicates they are tightening the rules around access to drugs, not loosening them (eliminating C and D), and are not simply punishing users (eliminating A). They are amending the law to make it align with the constitution, suggesting a strengthening of regulations.
"
Ke eng e neng e le molaong ka nakwana Ireland?,"The correct answer is **D: Dithethefatsi (Drugs)**.

Here's why:

The text states the law being amended concerns ""substances involved"" and ""medicines dispensed."" The Minister of Health highlighted concerns about the constitutionality of changes regarding these substances *after* the law comes into effect. This strongly indicates the law relates to drugs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho tlatlapa (Theft)** - The text does not mention theft.
*   **B: Bomenemene (Fraud)** - The text does not mention fraud.
*   **C: Tlhaselo (Assault)** - The text does not mention assault.



"
Motho eo ho belaellwang hore o molato o batlisiswa eng?,"The correct answer is **C: Bosenyi ba thepa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...o itse sesenyi se belaellwang sa motho wa monna se fuputswang bakeng sa ho kena sebakeng ntle le tumello ho fapana le **bosenyi ba thepa**.""  This directly translates to ""...identified suspected vandalism by a male suspect being investigated for entering a location without permission, as opposed to **theft of property**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho tlola molao (Breaking the law)** - Too broad. Vandalism and theft *are* breaking the law, but the specific accusation is about property.
*   **B: Tshenyo mmeleng (Bodily harm)** - The text doesn't mention any harm to people.
*   **D: Boshodu (Burglary)** - While entering a location without permission *could* be part of a burglary, the focus is on the vandalism/theft aspect, not the unlawful entry itself.



"
"Ha a fetola letshwao, mmelaellwa ha a ka a etsang?","The correct answer is **A: Fetola e nngwe ya ditlhaku tsa lona** (Change one of its letters).

Here's why:

The text specifically states the alteration involved changing the letter ""O"" to a small ""e"". This is a change of a single letter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: A le kgabisa ka letshwao la kgotso** (Add a peace sign) - While a peace sign *was* used as part of the covering, the alteration wasn't *adding* it, it was altering a letter.
* **C: Ho le senya** (To destroy it) - The sign wasn't destroyed, it was modified.
* **D: Sebedisa di-tarpaulins ho e fetola** (Use tarpaulins to change it) -  Using tarpaulins was the *method* of change, not the change itself. The change *was* altering the letter.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang eo motataisi wa Lenyesemane Karno a sa kang a qoswa ka eona?","The correct answer is **A: Tlolo ya molao** (Violation of the law).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hape o ne a qositswe ka hore o robile molao wa tshireletso ya khopiraete pele ho mona, *empa a se ke a qoswa*."" This explicitly says he was *accused* of violating the law but was **not convicted**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ho ratana le moithuti** (Affairs with students): The passage mentions he was only like a ""friend"" to the students, but doesn't suggest romantic relationships.
* **C: Ho hatisa dipapatso tse sa dumellweng** (Printing unauthorized advertisements): He *was* accused of this.
* **D: Ho sebedisa puo e nyefolang ka phaposing** (Using foul language in class): He *was* accused of this (""'puo ya seterateng ka phapusing ya thutelo"").



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke mang ya sa kang a nkwa ke Rolando Mendoza?","The correct answer is **A: Bahahlaudi**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states ""Ronaldo Mendoza o ile a thunya bahahlaudi ka sethunya sa moetso wa M16"" (Ronaldo Mendoza shot the tourists with an M16 rifle). This indicates the tourists were the direct target of his shooting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mapolesa** - The text says police rescued some hostages and that Mendoza was *shot by* police. He didn't shoot them.
*   **C: Bana** - The text states children were among the hostages *released* early.
*   **D: Ba nkang difoto** - The text mentions a photographer's house being searched, but Mendoza didn't shoot the photographer, only that they needed housing.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke baholehuwa bafe ba sa kang ba tiiswa hore ba lokollotswe kapele?","The correct answer is **A: Bahahlaudi**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Batshwaruwa ba tsheletseng, ho akarelletsa bana le ba hodileng, ba lokollotswe pele ho nako, hammoho le bo-raditshwantsho ba Mafilipino."" This explicitly says the children, elderly, and journalists were released. It doesn't mention the *tourists* (bahahlaudi) being released.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Maqheku:** The text doesn't mention whether the kidnappers were released early.
*   **C: Ba nkang difoto:** The text specifically states journalists were released early.
*   **D: Bana:** The text specifically states children were released early.



"
"Ho latela seratswana sena, ke mang ya bokellang mesaeno ya batho ba tshehetsang ho ngodiswa ka molao manyalo a batho ba bong bo tshwanang Brazil?","The correct answer is **A: Baipelaetsi**.

The text states: ""Baipelaetsi ba tshepa ho bokeletsa lengolo la ditletlebo le sainilweng ke batho ba 1.2 milione ho le teka Sebokeng sa Naha ka Pudungwana.""  ""Baipelaetsi"" directly translates to ""advocates"" or ""supporters"" and are the ones collecting the signatures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Roberto Jefferson:** He *has* the bill in his hands, but isn't collecting signatures.
* **C: Kereke ya Roma e Khatholike:** The text states they *oppose* the legalization of same-sex marriage.
* **D: Marta Suplicy:** She *introduced* the bill, but isn't currently collecting signatures.



"
Baipelaetsi ba tla fana ka kopo ya bona ho mang?,"The correct answer is **C: Lekgotla la Naha la Brazil**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Baipelaetsi ba tshepa ho bokeletsa lengolo la ditletlebo le sainilweng ke batho ba 1.2 milione ho le teka **Sebokeng sa Naha** ka Pudungwana.""  This directly indicates they will present their petition to the National Congress (Lekgotla la Naha) of Brazil.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kereke ya Roma e Khatholike:** While the passage mentions the Catholic Church's opposition, the petition isn't *to* the Church.
*   **B: Roberto Jefferson:** He is simply holding the bill, not the recipient of the petition.
*   **D: Ramotse wa São Paulo:** Marta Suplicy introduced the bill, but the petition goes to the National Congress.



"
"Ho latela tlaleho ya Armand Versace, ho ile ha etsahalang ka ho toba pele letshwele le qala ho etsa ho hong ka lebaka la boemo ba lehodimo?","The correct answer is **A: Ho ile ha qala ho na sefako**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...*kamora mona sefako sa theoha, batho ba ne ba tshohile...*"". This translates to ""...after that a whirlwind descended, people were scared..."".  This directly describes what happened *immediately before* the panic and reaction to the weather.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pontsho e ne e le morao metsotso e mehlano** - This refers to something happening *before* the wind started, not right before the panic.
* **C: Ho ne ho e-na le meya e matla** - While there were strong winds (70km/h), the whirlwind (sefako) is what triggered the immediate fear.
* **D: O ile a lahlehelwa ke tlaleho ya setho sa lelapa** - This is a consequence *of* the events, not something that happened *before* the reaction to the weather.



"
"Ho latela Versace, meya e matla ka ho fetisisa e qadile neng?","The correct answer is **A: Metsotso e mmalwa ka mora hore pontsho e qale**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Metsotso e mehlano kamora ho qaleha ha pontsho moya wa qala ho tsukutla, nako ya motsotso ha morao, moya wa fihlela lebelo la 70km/h...""  This directly translates to ""Five minutes after the tornado started, the wind began to pick up, and a minute later, the wind reached a speed of 70km/h."" This means the strongest winds began *a few minutes* after the tornado started.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ka mora pula** - The rain came *after* the winds were already strong.
*   **C: Ka mora hore a lahlehelwe ke kgaitsedi ya hae** - Losing his aunt is a separate event, not related to the wind's strength.
*   **D: Pele ho sefako** - The text doesn't specify when the strongest winds were in relation to the lightning strike (sefako).



"
"Pele ho Fred, ho ne ho tlalehilwe difefo tse kae tse kholo ka botjhabela tsa 35°W?","The correct answer is **B: A mararo**.

The text states: ""Fred ke saetlelone ya ditropiking e matla ka ho fetisisa e kileng ya rekotwa ka borwa le botjhabela hakana lewatleng la Atlelantiki haesale ho tloha qalehong ya ditshwantsho tsa sathalaete, mme ke ya boraro ka boholo e rekotilweng ka botjhabela ba 35°W."" 

This directly translates to ""Fred is the strongest tropical storm ever recorded this far south and east in the Atlantic Ocean since the beginning of satellite imagery, and is the *third* largest recorded east of 35°W.""  Therefore, two other storms were larger."
"Ha Fred a ne a le haufi le dihlekehleke tsa Cape Verde, e ne e leba nqa efe?","The correct answer is **D: Leboya-bophirimela**.

The text states: ""Sefefo sa Fred hajwale se na le meya ya lebelo la dimmaele tse 105 ka hora (165 km/h) mme **se lebile ka leboya bophirima**.""  (""Fred currently has winds of 105 miles per hour (165 km/h) and is moving **northwest**."")"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e nang le lebelo le potlakileng ho feta pele ho yona?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The passage explicitly states that 802.11n is faster than its predecessors, with a theoretical maximum speed of 600 Mbit/s.  The other options (802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g) are mentioned as being older standards that 802.11n is compatible with, implying they are slower.
"
Ho hlokahala eng hore 802.11n e be morao e tsamaellane le 802.11b?,"The correct answer is **D: Diradio tse pedi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that 802.11n can fall back to compatibility with older standards (like 802.11b) *if* the devices have radios capable of operating on both 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz frequencies.  802.11b operates on 2.4Ghz, so having a radio that supports both is necessary for backwards compatibility.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mabelo a potlakileng haholo** - While 802.11n *is* faster, speed isn't a requirement for backwards compatibility, it's a benefit of the new standard.
*   **B: Bokgoni ba 802.11b ho sebetsa ho 5.0Ghz** - 802.11b does *not* operate on 5.0Ghz.
*   **C: Tshebetso ya 600Mbit/s** - This is the maximum speed of 802.11n, not a requirement for backwards compatibility.



"
Mohapiwa khau ya khauta wa Diolimpiki o ne a lokela ho sesa ho ya Dipapaling tsa Commonwealth tse kae?,"The correct answer is **B: A mararo**.

Here's why:

The text states the athlete was supposed to compete in ""mabelong a mararo a neheletsano a Dipapadi tsa Commonwealth"" which translates to ""three cooperative events of the Commonwealth Games.""

Therefore, the answer is three."
Hobaneng mohapi wa kgauta ya Diolimpiki a ne a sa nwa meriana bakeng sa bohloko ba hae?,"The correct answer is **D: Ha e dumellwe ho Dipapadi tsa Commonwealth**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""empa ka lebaka la ditletlebo tsa hae tsa ho se kwetle o ne a hloka boitshepo. Ha a kgona ho sebedisa dithethefatsi tse hlokehang hore a fedise ho opelwa ha hae hobane **di ne di thibetswe Dipapading**."" 

This directly translates to him being unable to use the necessary medication because it was prohibited at the Commonwealth Games.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: O ne a se na bohloko** - The passage indicates he *did* have pain (""ho opelwa ha hae"" - his injury)
*   **B: E ile ya mo kudisa** - The passage does not mention any benefit from the drugs.
*   **C: O ne a amehile ka hore e tla ama bophelo ba hae hampe** - While he lacked confidence, the reason he couldn't use the medication wasn't fear of side effects, but because they were banned.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e ka beng e ile ya baka pherekano mabapi le mosebetsi wa tshisinyeho ya lefatshe?","The correct answer is **A: Boteng ba maru a lefifi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maru a matsho a neng a sa amahanywe le ketsahalo ya ho foqoha ha seretse se tjhesang a ile a tlalehwa mesikong ya thaba. Maru a ile a etsa hore ho be le pherekano ya hore na ehlile ho foqoha ho jwalo ho ile ha etsahala."" This directly translates to: ""Dark streaks were reported on the mountainsides that were not associated with the glacial outburst. The streaks created confusion about whether such a flood actually occurred.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ditlaleho tse tswang Ofising ya Icelandic Meteorological:** The Icelandic Meteorological Office confirmed *there was no* earthquake, which doesn't create confusion, it provides information.
* **C: Mmapa wa tshisinyeho ya lefatshe wa matjhaba:** The USGS map not showing earthquakes is background information but doesn't directly cause the confusion about the outburst.
* **D: Ketsahalo e tlalehilweng dibakeng tse ding tsa Iceland:** The passage doesn't mention other events in Iceland causing confusion.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, phetoho ya mokgahlelo e etsahetse neng?","The correct answer is **C: Ka la 10 Hlakubele**.

The text states: ""Ketsahalo ya tshitshinyeho ya lefatshe e ikgethileng e lebisitseng ho tjhentjheng ha sebopeho e etsahetse ka la 10 Hlakubele..."" This directly tells us the event occurred *on* February 10th.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pele ho la 10 Hlakubele:** The text doesn't say the shift happened *before* February 10th, but *on* that date.
* **B: Dihoreng tse 48 tse fetileng:** This refers to the lack of seismic activity reported by the Icelandic Meteorological Office, not the shift itself.
* **D: Bekeng e fetileng:**  The USGS didn't show earthquakes in Iceland the *week* before, but the event itself happened on February 10th.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang tse mabapi le dipatlisiso tsa kgwedi ya Chandrayaan-1 eo e seng nnete?,"The correct answer is **A: Sathelaete s e ileng ya qala dipatlisiso e ne e-na le basebetsi**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** The Chandrayaan-1 *released* its Moon Impact Probe (MIP). This implies it was an unmanned probe/satellite. There's no mention of any crew or personnel on board.
*   **B is true:** The passage specifically mentions ""disebediswa tsa bohlokwa tsa saense"" (important scientific instruments).
*   **C is true:** The MIP successfully crashed near the South Pole, indicating a successful release and impact.
*   **D is true:** The passage states it ""rwetse setshwantsho sa folakga ya naha ya India, e pentilweng mahlakore ohle"" (captured an image of the Indian flag painted on all sides).

Therefore, the only statement that is *not* true based on the provided text is that the satellite had personnel on board."
Ke efe ho dipolelo tse latelang e hlalosang phuputso ya kgwedi ka nepo?,"The correct answer is **B: Ho fihla ha yona ka kotsi ho ile ha atleha** (Its intentional crash landing was successful).

Here's why:

*   The text states the Moon Impact Probe (MIP) *intentionally* crashed onto the lunar surface (""e tsubelletseng ho parola lepatlelo la kgwedi""). The successful crashing is the core accomplishment described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E ile ya dula haufi le palo e ka leboya ya Kgwedi** (It landed near the north pole of the Moon) - The text clearly states it crashed near the *south* pole.
*   **C: E ile ya ntshwa ho satelate e nkang batho** (It was released from a manned satellite) - The text doesn't mention anything about it being released from a manned satellite. It was part of the Chandrayaan-1 mission.
*   **D: E ne e nkile disebediswa tse pedi tsa bohlokwa** (It carried two important instruments) - The text says it carried ""disebediswa tsa bohlokwa tsa saense"" (important scientific instruments) but doesn't specify the *number* of instruments. It also mentions the camera, which adds to the scientific capabilities."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke tekanyo efe ya tshireletso kgahlanong le lefu lena e tla kengwa tshebetsong qetellong?","The correct answer is **C: Vaksine tsa encephalitis**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dibotlolwana tse dimilione tse mmalwa tsa vaksine ya lefu la encephalitis le tsona di tshepisitswe ke mmuso, e leng se tla thusa ho lokisetsa makalana a bophelo bo botle bakeng sa selemo se tlang."" This directly indicates that the government is providing vaccines as a protective measure against the disease.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Meriana e bolayang dikokwanyana:** While mentioned, these are used to control the *mosquitoes* transmitting the disease, not a direct protective measure for people.
*   **B: Batshwari ba dikolobe:** These are sent to affected areas to *control the mosquitoes*, not to protect people directly.
*   **D: Dikharetene tsa menwang:** The passage mentions destroying mosquito breeding grounds but doesn't say anything about ""nets""."
Lefu lena le fetela bathong jwang?,"The correct answer is **A: Menwang**.

The passage states: ""Lefu lena le tsamaiswa ke dikolobe, ebe jwale le fetisetswa bathong ke menwang."" This directly translates to: ""This disease is transmitted by mosquitoes, and now transmitted to humans by flies.""
"
Ho hloleha ha kahlolo ya bobedi ho ka ba le diphello dife?,"The correct answer is **B: Tokelo ya kamoso ya mekgatlo ya batho ba bong bo tshwanang** (The right to same-sex marriage).

Here's why:

The text states that if the second reading fails, it ""could open the door for same-sex marriage."" This directly indicates that the failure of the bill would mean same-sex couples could potentially have the right to marry.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tlhahlobo ya hang-hang ya HJR-3** (Immediate review of HJR-3) - The text says it will be re-examined in 2015/2016, not immediately.
*   **C: Seboka sa molao oa tshohanyetso** (Emergency law conference) - The text doesn't mention any emergency conference.
*   **D: Thibelo ya manyalo a batho ba bong bo tshwanang** (Restriction of same-sex marriage) - The bill is *intended* to restrict same-sex marriage. Its failure would *remove* a restriction, not impose one.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, kahlolo ya bobedi e hlakotswe neng?","The correct answer is **A: Nakong ya kopano ya molao** (During the legislative session).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Phetoho e entswe sesheneng ena ya ketsamolao moo polelo ya bobedi e hlakotsweng pele ke Ntlo ya Baemedi ya Palamente...""  This directly translates to ""The change was made during this legislative session where the second reading was cleared by the House of Representatives...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ka-2011 (In 2011):** While the overall legislation was passed in 2011, the passage specifically says the second reading was cleared *during* the session.
* **C: Ka Mantaha (On Monday):** Monday refers to when the Senate passed it, not when the second reading was cleared.
* **D: Ka-2015 (In 2015):**  2015 is when HJR-3 will be reviewed again, not when the second reading occurred.



"
"""Dipampiri tsa """"Panama"""" di ne di phatlalatswa ho bo-mang?""","The correct answer is **A: Feme ya Mossack Fonseca**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the ""Panama Papers"" are documents *from* the law firm Mossack Fonseca. They were leaked *from* this firm, and the papers contain information about their activities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Moqolotsi wa ditaba:** While journalists (like those at The Guardian) *reported* on the papers, they didn't create or publish them initially.
*   **C: Bank ya Deutsche:** Deutsche Bank was mentioned as being involved in using shell companies, but they didn't release the Panama Papers.
*   **D: Baetapele ba mmuso wa Iceland:** Leaders resigned *because* of the Panama Papers, but they didn't publish them.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke mang eo khatiso ya Brithani e ileng ya bolela hore o laola dikhamphani tse ngata tse neng di sebediswa ho pata leruo?","The correct answer is **C: Bank ya Deutsche**.

The passage states: ""Koranta ya Borithani The Guardian e boletse hore Deutsche Bank e laola ho ka bang karolo ya nngwe borarong ya dikhampani tsa robaditsweng (""""shell company"""") tse 1200 tse sebediswang ho fihlella sena."" This directly identifies Deutsche Bank as the entity alleged to control many of the companies used to hide wealth."
Ke kotsi efe ho tse latelang ya sefofane e bolaileng batho ka ho fetisisa?,"The correct answer is **A: Sefofane se ile sa swahlamana tseleng e yang Armenia ho tloha Iran**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Kgwedinng e fetileng Iran e bile le koduwa e mpe ka ho fetisisa nakong ya dilemo tse ngata ha sefofane sa baeti se neng se lebile Armenia se swahlamana, mme se bolaya batho ba 168 ba neng ba le ho yona.""  This clearly indicates that the plane crash en route to Armenia resulted in the highest number of fatalities (168).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Serwala-nkhwana sa mapolesa se ile sa swahlamana** - This crash killed 3 people and injured 3, far fewer than the 168.
*   **C: Sefofane se ile sa swahlamana ha se leba Iran se tswa Armenia** - This is a rewording of the correct incident but phrasing it like this is not what the text states.
*   **D: Sefofane se ile sa swahlamana Mashhad** - This crash killed 19 people, less than the 168.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo e seng lebaka la bongata ba dikotsi tsa sefofane tse etsahalang Iran?,"The correct answer is **D: Sehlopha sa difofane se sa hlokomelwang hantle**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions poor maintenance of aircraft.** It states the country has aircraft in ""bad repair"" and two incidents (helicopter crash, passenger plane crash) point to mechanical failures.  This directly implies a lack of proper upkeep and maintenance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sehlopha sa khale sa difofane tsa setjhaba le tsa sesole (Old fleet of civilian and military aircraft)** - The passage doesn't *directly* state the fleet is old, but the poor repair state implies age is likely a contributing factor.
* **B: Khaello ya tekanyetso e dumellang ho reka difofane tse ntjha (Lack of funding to buy new aircraft)** - This is stated in the passage as a problem – international sanctions prevent buying new planes.
* **C: Dikotlo tse thibelang ho reka difofane tse ntjha (Sanctions restricting the purchase of new aircraft)** - This is also explicitly mentioned in the passage.



Therefore, while the age of the planes and lack of funding contribute, the *direct* cause of the crashes implied by the text is the poor condition of the existing aircraft, indicating inadequate maintenance."
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa kenyelletswang tlalehong ya Sehlopha sa Phuputso sa Iraq?,"The correct answer is **B: Phatlalatso ya hore ka diphetoho tse itseng, pefo e ntseng e eketseha Iraq e ka qojwa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the report *does* include:

*   **A:** Criticizing the current plan (""seholla ka tsela e kgolo ho batlang e le ntlha e nngwe le e nngwe ya leano la hajwale la Botsamaisi ba Puso mabapi le Iraq mme e kgothaletsa phetoho ya hanghang motjheng wa ditaba"").
*   **C:** Suggestions to protect Iraqi borders (""kgothaletsa phetoho ya hanghang motjheng wa ditaba...ho sireletsa meedi ya Iraq kgahlanong le dikgathatso tsa leqhoko"").
*   **D:** An appeal for US reconciliation (""Tlaleho e qala ka boipiletso ba ho tshwara dingangisano tse bulehileng le ho thehwa ha kutlwano naheng ya United States e mabapi le leano bakeng sa Botjhabela bo Hare"").

However, the passage does *not* mention any declaration that increasing pressure on Iraq can be avoided with certain changes. It focuses on diplomatic solutions and changes to the current plan, not avoiding pressure.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa kang ya kgothaletswa ke Sehlopha sa Phuputso sa Iraq tlalehong ya yona?,"The correct answer is **A: Hore ho phatlalatswe tiiso ya ho emisa pefo e ntseng e hola**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the report *notes it cannot guarantee any action in Iraq will halt the insurgency, escalating violence, or deterioration leading to state failure*.  This means the report does *not* promise or endorse a guarantee of stopping the growing violence.

Let's look at why the other options are correct and therefore *were* recommended:

* **B: Phetoho e potlakileng ya tataiso:** The report ""heavily challenges nearly every aspect of the current Administration's plan for Iraq and calls for an immediate change in course.""
* **C: Tshebediso ya dipuisano tse bulehileng:** The report begins with a ""call for open dialogue and consensus-building in the United States regarding a policy for the Middle East.""
* **D: Ho thehwa ha mohato o motjha wa bodiplomate:** The first of its 78 recommendations is that ""a diplomatic initiative must be undertaken before year-end to protect Iraq's borders against illicit activity and rebuild relations with its neighbors.""



"
"Ho ya ka mapolesa, ke mang ya neng a nkwa e le monna ya letsohong le letona la Provenzano?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

The passage states: ""Sepolesa se itse Lo Piccolo o ne a itlhomme pele hobane e ne e le letsoho le letona la Provenzano mane Palermo..."" (Police knew Lo Piccolo had risen through the ranks because he was Provenzano's right-hand man in Palermo...).

Therefore, Lo Piccolo is identified as Provenzano's right-hand man.



"
"Ho latela dintlha tse fanweng serapeng, sesosa sa lefu la Falcone e ne e le sefe?","The correct answer is **A: O ile a bolawa nakong ya ntwa e neng e tsamaiswa ke Riina**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Provenzano ha a ne a fedisa ntwa e qhojwang ke Riina kgahlanong le profensi ena e nkileng maphelo a diqhoku tsa Mafia Giovanni Falcone le Paolo Borsellino ka 1992.""  This clearly indicates that Falcone's death occurred *during* a war initiated by Riina.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: O ile a bolawa ke mapolesa:** The passage does not suggest police involvement in his death.
* **C: Lo Piccolo o ile a laelwa hore a mo bolaye:** While Lo Piccolo was a close associate, the text doesn't state he *carried out* the assassination of Falcone.
* **D: O ile a bolawa ke mohlabani-mmoho le yena wa Mafia Paolo Borsellino:** The passage states they *both* were killed, but doesn't imply Borsellino killed Falcone. They were victims of the same conflict.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo e seng e nngwe ya dikgau tsa Hitoshi Saito?,"The correct answer is **A: Mampodi wa Lefatshe ka makgetlo a mabedi**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""MoJapane judoka Hitoshi Saito, e leng mohlodi wa dimedale tse pedi tsa kgauta tsa Olimpiki... O e ne e le Mampodi wa mehleng wa Diolimpiki le Lefatshe..."" This means he was a former World Champion, *not* a two-time World Champion.
*   **The passage states:** ""...Saito e ne e le modulasetulo wa borupelli wa All Japan Judo Federation ka nako ya ho shwa ha hae."" (He was a vice-president of the All Japan Judo Federation) - This confirms **B** is correct.
*   **The passage states:** ""...e leng mohlodi wa dimedale tse pedi tsa kgauta tsa Olimpiki"" (a two-time Olympic gold medalist) - This confirms **C** is correct.
*   He was obviously a Judo expert, being a Judoka (Judo practitioner) and champion, confirming **D** is correct.

Therefore, the only thing *not* explicitly stated as a fact about Hitoshi Saito in the passage is that he was a two-time World Champion."
Ke hokae moo Iwasaki a ileng a kgona ho qoba ho etsa dikano?,"The correct answer is **B: Nepal**.

The passage states: ""o phonyoha lenyalo naheng ya Nepal"" which translates to ""he survived a marriage in Nepal"". This implies he avoided *making* a marriage (getting married) in Nepal.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Japane** - The passage doesn't mention anything about avoiding commitments in Japan.
*   **C: India** - He was arrested in India, not avoiding commitments.
*   **D: Tibet** - He was attacked by a rabid dog in Tibet, not avoiding commitments."
Ke mang ya ileng a hlasela Iwasaki?,"The correct answer is **C: Ntja**.

The text states: ""O ile tlatlatjwa ke maphaerete, a **hlaselwa naheng ya Tibet ke ntjha e tshwerweng ke lefu la marabi**..."" which translates to ""He was bitten by parasites, and **attacked in Tibet by a rabid dog**...""

Therefore, the answer is a dog."
Alonso o qetile lebelo la hae neng?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka mora hore Schumacher a kgaotse lebelo la hae**.

Here's why:

The text states that Alonso led for most of the race but slowed down *after* his pit-stop and *after* Schumacher's suspension was damaged. This implies Alonso finished his race after Schumacher had an issue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ka mora hore Schumacher a senye dla hae le ka pele** - This is close but doesn't specify Alonso finishing *after* Schumacher's issue.
*   **B: Fisichella o ile a lahlehelwa ke taolo ya koloi ya hae** - This refers to Fisichella's issue, not Alonso's.
*   **D: Pele a etella pele** - This is the opposite of what happened; he slowed *after* leading.



"
Ke eng e entseng hore Schumacher a khaotse lebelo la hae pele ho nako?,"The correct answer is **D: Tshenyo ya ho emiswa ha koloi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Michael Schumacher o qetetse mojaho wa hae hanyane kamora Alonso, hobane saspenshene ya hae e ne e senyehile ka lebaka la tshubuhlellano ya semphete-ke-o-fete nakong ya mojaho."" This directly translates to: ""Michael Schumacher finished his race shortly after Alonso, because his suspension was damaged due to debris on the track during the race.""  Suspension issues are a form of damage to the car's system, and thus a ""tshenyo ya ho emiswa ha koloi"" (damage to the suspension).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: O ile a lahlehelwa ke taolo ya koloi ya hae** - This happened to Fisichella, not Schumacher.
*   **B: Ho thulana le Alonso** - The text doesn't mention any direct competition issue between the two.
*   **C: Tshenyo ya mabidi e bakilweng ke Fisichella** - Fisichella caused a crash, but it didn't directly damage Schumacher's car.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke mosebetsi wa mang ho beha beile bakeng sa ba tshwarwang?","The correct answer is **A: Ofisiri e tshwarang (The arresting officer)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mokhomishenara o teka beile, haeba e fanwa, mme o tiisa semolao diqoso tse hlahletsweng ke **moofisiri ya tshwereng batho**.""  This clearly indicates the arresting officer is the one who sets bail if it's granted and validates the charges.



"
"Ho ya ka taelo ya nakwana ya thibelo e boletsweng serapeng, ba tshwerweng ba tlameha ho ba le eng e le hore ba ka tshwarwa nako e telele ho feta dihora tse 24?","The correct answer is **B: Kopano le ofisiri e tshwarang**.

Here's why:

The passage states the injunction was issued because people were being released after more than 24 hours *without being seen by the magistrate* after the arresting officer had filed charges which the magistrate would then legally validate.  This implies that being seen by the arresting officer is necessary for continued detention beyond 24 hours.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Beile:** The passage mentions the commissioner appealing, but this doesn't relate to *why* someone can be held longer than 24 hours.
*   **C: Diqoso tsa molao tse fanweng ke Moahloli Glynn:** The injunction concerns people *not* being seen by the magistrate to validate the charges, not the charges themselves being issued by a specific prosecutor.
*   **D: Nyewe:** While the passage mentions a right to a quick trial, it doesn't state that having a trial is a *requirement* to be held beyond 24 hours.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke lebaka lefeng le sa sebediswang ho hlalosa ho thibelwa hwa dikgetho-pheto?","The correct answer is **A: Menyetla ya mathata a tshireletso**.

The passage explicitly states that Lodin has explained the cancellation of elections as a way to ""protect Afghans from the financial cost and the security risk posed by further elections."" This makes security risk the stated reason.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Khanyetsano ya molaotheo:** While the passage mentions earlier reports saying cancellation *would* be unconstitutional, it then states diplomats found *insufficient* legal basis for this claim. So, constitutional conflict is presented as something potentially *not* being the case.
* **C: Ditjeo tse boima:** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Molaotheo o ntlha-pedi:** The passage doesn't characterize the constitution as flawed; it just discusses whether the cancellation is legal under it.



"
Hobaneng baemedi ba dinaha ba bone dikgetho-phetho di sa hlokahale?,"The correct answer is **B: Ho ne ho na le menyetla ya mathata a tshireletso**.

Here's why:

The passage states Lodin has decided to cancel elections ""to save Afghans money and the security risk posed by further elections."" Diplomats also found ""insufficient legal basis in the Afghanistan constitution to support that runoff elections are necessary."" This points to security concerns being a primary reason for deeming the elections unnecessary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ene ele kgahlanong le molaotheo** - The passage states diplomats *found insufficient legal basis* meaning there wasn't a clear prohibition, but not necessarily that it was *against* the constitution.
*   **C: Molaotheo o ne o le ntlhla-pedi** - The passage doesn't state the constitution was flawed. It states there was a lack of support *within* the constitution for holding runoffs.
*   **D: Ditjeo tsa dikgetho di ne di le boima** - The passage doesn't mention the cost of the elections being a primary reason, it mentions saving money as one factor along with security.



"
Ke mang ya fanang ka ditshebeletso tsa kabo ya toka ho FATA?,"The correct answer is **B: Babuelli Ba-sepolotiki**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""Diejente tsa Sepolotiki"" (Political Agents) are responsible for providing governance and judicial services under Article 247 of the Pakistani Constitution in FATA. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mmuso wa Pakistan** - While ultimately the authority stems from Pakistan, the passage specifies *how* services are delivered – through the Political Agents.
*   **C: Moporesitente wa Pakistan** - The President *appoints* the Political Agents, but they themselves deliver the services.
*   **D: Mmuso wa Borithane** - The passage mentions Britain's historical involvement but states the current system is under Pakistani control.



"
Ke polelo efeng eo e seng nnete ka “Babuelli Ba-sepolotiki” ba FATA?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba fana ka ditshebeletso tsa kabo ya toka**.

Here's why:

The passage states the ""Political Agents"" *deliver governance and justice services* under Article 247 of the Pakistani Constitution. This means they *provide* justice services, not *administer* them with absolute authority. 

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

*   **B: Ba kgethuoe kgethilwe ke Moporesitente wa Pakistan:** The text states the President appoints the ""Political Agents"" to govern FATA.
*   **C: Ba itshetlehile ka molatheo wa Pakistan:** They operate under Article 247 of the Pakistani Constitution.
*   **D: Ba na le taolo e felletseng dikarolong tse ding:** The passage says they exercise ""almost complete control"" over these areas.



"
Emma Stone o ne a thonyeditswe khau efeng?,"The correct answer is **C: Sebapadi sehlwahlwa sa mosadi** (Best Actress).

The text states: ""Gosling le Stone ba thonyeditswe Sebapadi se Hlwahlwa ka ho Fetisisa sa Monna le sa Mosadi."" This translates to ""Gosling and Stone were awarded Best Actor and Best Actress.""  Since the question asks about Emma Stone, the answer is Best Actress."
Filimi ene e sa thonyetswa khau efeng?,"The correct answer is **A: Setswantsho se Hlwahlwa**.

The passage states: ""Gosling le Stone ba thonyeditswe Sebapadi se Hlwahlwa ka ho Fetisisa sa Monna le sa Mosadi"" and ""Setshwantsho se Hlwahlwa ka ho Fetisisa"". This indicates the film won awards for Best Picture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Boqapi ba Ditswantsho bo Hlwahlwa** - The passage mentions ""Sinemathokrafi"" (Cinematography) being awarded, but not ""Boqapi ba Ditswantsho"" as a standalone award.
*   **C: Botswaki ba Medumo bo Hlwahlwa** - While ""Botswaki ba Modumo"" (Sound Mixing) was awarded, the overall 'Best Sound' wasn't highlighted as a main achievement.
*   **D: Pina ya Motheo e Hlwahlwa** - Two songs *from* the film won awards for best original song, but the film itself wasn't awarded specifically for 'Best Original Song'.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efeng esetseng e sebetsa kamora ho reketla hwa lefatshe?","The correct answer is **B: Boemafofane ba Ishikawa**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Boemafofane ba Noto mane Ishikawa prefecture bo sa ntse bo kwetswe,"" meaning the airport is still operating. The other options are either not operating or have issues:

*   **A:** The reactors at the Shika nuclear power plant were *shut down* (kwetswe), not operating.
*   **C:** Train services were *suspended* (sitisisitswe).
*   **D:** The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant was operating *normally* *before* the earthquake, but the text does not mention its status after."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke ntho efe e senyehileng ka lebaka la ho reketla hwa lefatshe?","The correct answer is **C: Ditsela tse ding**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Ditsela tse ding di senyehile"" (Some roads were damaged). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Malapa a mang** - The text says 9400 homes *lost water* and 100 lost *electricity*, but doesn't say they were damaged.
*   **B: Diqhomane tse pedi setsing sa Shika** - The text says reactors #1 and #2 *were stopped*, not damaged.
*   **D: Boemafofane ba Noto** - The text says the airport *is still closed*, not damaged.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke ntho efeng e sa kenyeletswang tokomaneng eo?","The correct answer is **D: Dikhulakhulano tsa madiboho (Refugee negotiations)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions:

*   **Bokamoso ba Jerusalema (Future of Jerusalem):** ""maemo a kamoso a toropo ya Jerusalema""
*   **Sesosa sa ntwa ya 1967 (Reasons for the 1967 war):** ""eo Palestina e batlang hore e thehwe hodima meedi ya pele ho Ntwa ya Botjhabela bo Hare ya 1967""
*   **Boteng ba masole phuleng (Military presence in the valley):** ""Iseraele e batla hore ho be le boteng bo tswellang phuleng ena""

The passage does **not** mention any discussions about refugees/madiboho. Therefore, dikhulakhulano tsa madiboho is the one thing not included in the document's details.



"
Ke ntho efeng ho tse latelang eo eseng tse ding tsa ditlhoko tsa Palesetina?,"The correct answer is **D: Dilemo tse hlano tsa boteng ba masole Phuleng ya Jorotane.**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** Palestine wants a state based on the borders *before* the 1967 war. It also says Israel wants a ten-year military presence in the Jordan Valley, while the PA is only willing to accept a five-year presence.
*   **Palestine's needs/demands:** The passage clearly outlines that Palestine seeks borders based on pre-1967 lines (A), and has concerns about the future status of Jerusalem (C), and is against a long-term Israeli military presence in the Jordan Valley (B). 
*   **The discrepancy:** The *five-year* vs *ten-year* military presence in the Jordan Valley is Israel's condition, *not* a Palestinian demand. It's a point of disagreement.

Therefore, the five-year timeframe is the element that isn't a core Palestinian requirement but rather a point of contention *regarding* Israel's conditions."
Ma o ithutetse molao naheng efeng?,"The correct answer is **A: Amerika**.

The text states Ma studied at New York University and Harvard Law School, both located in the United States of America.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke bobuelli ba naha efeng bo thusitseng Ma hore a hlole dikgetho?","The correct answer is **A: Amerika**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Ma studied at New York University and Harvard Law School and had a US ""green card"" (permanent resident status). This indicates a strong connection to and support from the United States, which would have been a significant asset during the elections, especially given the context of opposing the mainland Chinese government. The passage also references statements by Hsieh about Ma potentially fleeing *to* the US during times of trouble.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Hong Kong:** While Ma is from Hong Kong, the passage highlights support from the US.
*   **United Kingdom:** There's no mention of the UK in the text.
*   **China:** Ma is opposing the Chinese government, so it wouldn't be a source of support.



"
"Jwalo ka ha ho hlalositswe seratswaneng, Carolyn Wilson o sebeleditse mang pele a tloha toropong?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

The text states ""Carolyn Wilson wa OHA o utswitse didipositi tsa tshireletso tsa bona, mme a balehela sebakeng se seng.""  This directly means Carolyn Wilson worked for OHA before leaving.



"
"Ho mabelo a makoloi a mane a setseng sehleng sena, ke mang ya boemong ba bone ho Bompodi ba Boqhobi?","The correct answer is **D: Bowyer**.

Here's how we can determine that from the text:

*   The text states: ""Hamlin o na le dintlha tse mashome a mabedi kamorao, empa tse hlano kapele ho Bowyer."" (Hamlin is 20 points behind the leader, but 5 points ahead of Bowyer.)
*   This means Bowyer is 5 points *behind* Hamlin, making him in 6th place, while Hamlin is in 5th. 
*   Kahne is 6th, Stewart is 8th, and Hamlin is 5th.
* The question asks for the 4th position. The text tells us that Johnson is in 2nd position, and Truex Jr. is in 6th. Thus, we know Kahne is 6th, which makes Bowyer in 7th place.

Therefore, **Bowyer** is in 6th place, making him the fourth position, meaning he is in the tenth place."
"Ho latela tlhodisano e boletsweng seratswaneng, Kahne o na le dintlha tse kae tsa Bompodi ba Boqhobi?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The passage states: ""Kahne le Truex, Jr. ba bohlanong le botsheletseng ka dintlha tse 2,220 le 2,207 ka tlhahlamano."" This directly tells us Kahne has 2,220 points."
"Ho latela seratswna, ke makgetlo a makae ao batho ba boneng majwe a tswang sebakeng (meteorites) ao hamorao a netefaditsweng ele a mofuta wa Mars?","The correct answer is **B: Makgetlo a mahlano**.

The passage states: ""Ho dumelwa hore ke lekgetlo la bohlano nalaneng ya moo batho ba boneng matheriale ya dikhemikhale e netefaditsweng hore e tswa Mars e wetseng Lefatsheng."" which translates to ""It is believed to be the fifth time in history that people have witnessed chemical material confirmed to be from Mars falling to Earth.""
"
"Jwalo ka ha ho boletswe seratswaneng, ke eng se o e leng nnete ka majoe ao a fumanweng a mofuta wa Mars?","The correct answer is **C: Boleng ba tsona ke didolara tse 11, 000 tsa Amerika ho feta le khauta**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""A mang a majwe ana, a fumanehang ka sewelo haholo Lefatsheng, a rekisitswe ka theko e tlohang ho US$11,000 ho fihla ho $22,500 aonse ka nngwe, e leng se nkang theko ya kgauta makgetlo a leshome."" This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kaofela ona a fumanwe ka Phupu ha di “meteorite” di wa** - While some were found after a fall in July, the text doesn't say *all* were found then.
*   **B: Di 24 000** - This refers to the total number of meteorites that have fallen to Earth, not specifically Martian ones.
*   **D: Di 34** - This is the total number of meteorites confirmed to be from Mars, not a detail about the recently found stones."
Schumacher o ile a tlohela mosebetsi neng?,"The correct answer is **C: Kamora ho nka sebaka sa Felipe Massa**.

Here's why:

The text states that Schumacher ""o ne a lokela ho nka sebaka sa Felipe Massa ya lemetseng"" (had to take the place of the injured Felipe Massa). This directly links Schumacher returning to the role with Massa's injury.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kamora ho tjhaisa hwa Felipe Massa** - While Massa was injured, Schumacher didn't return *after* his injury healed, he returned *because* of it.
*   **B: Kamora hoba mpodi wa bosupa** - The text says he retired after winning 7 championships, but doesn't link that to his return.
*   **D: Mafelong a sehla sa selemo sa 2009** - The text says Massa was expected to miss the entire 2009 season, but doesn't state Schumacher left at the end of it. It just details *why* he came back in the first place.



"
Massa o lemetse neng?,"The correct answer is **A: Nakong ya Grand Prix**.

The text states: ""Massa o ne a lemetse hloohong kamora ho thula nakong ya Hungarian Grand Prix ya 2009."" This directly translates to ""Massa was injured in the head after crashing during the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.""



"
"Ho latela seratswana, tukiso ee e tlo ama AOL jwang?","The correct answer is **C: Dipalo tsa basebedisi ba AOL di tla hlodisana le tsa Yahoo le Microsoft**.

Here's why:

The passage states that AOL's dominance is *because* of its large user base in the US. However, it also says the user base of Yahoo! and Microsoft *combined* is larger than AOL's. The passage implies that this situation threatens AOL's position, suggesting their user numbers will likely fall to match those of their competitors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dipalo tsa basebedisi ba AOL di ka nna tsa nyoloha** - The passage suggests the opposite - a *decline* in AOL's influence.
*   **B: AOL e tla ba yona feela khampani e tla matlafatsa mmaraka wa IM** - The passage explicitly states the competition from Yahoo! and Microsoft.
*   **D: AOL ha e sa tla sebediswa Amerika** - The passage doesn't say AOL will stop being used, just that its position is threatened.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efeng e ka nnang ya feela ho latela tukiso ee e ntjha?","The correct answer is **C: Bolokolohi ba AOL ba ho ntlafatsa mmaraka ka mokoka wa bona.**

Here's why:

The passage states AOL has maintained dominance in the IM market *because* of its widespread use in the US. It then says this dominance could end (""tokoloho ena e ka nna ya fela"") because Yahoo! and Microsoft's combined users are larger than AOL's. 

This directly implies the loss of AOL's *freedom* to control the market—their ability to innovate and lead the IM market as they have been. The passage focuses on the potential loss of AOL’s market position.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho nama ha ntlafatso ya marangrang a dinaheng tsa Amerika** (The naming of network improvements in America) - This isn't discussed in the passage.
*   **B: Tshebediso ya mmaraka wa IM** (Use of the IM market) - The passage discusses *control* of the market, not just its use.
*   **D: Setlamo sa Yahoo le Microsoft** (The status of Yahoo and Microsoft) - While their larger user base is mentioned, the passage is about the *impact* on AOL, not their status.



"
"Ke batho ba bakae ba bolauweng tlhaselong eo, bao eseng mapolesa?","The correct answer is **A: 19**.

Here's why:

The passage states that 18 people were injured, *including* police. It also states that two police officers were killed.  The question asks for the number of people killed *who are not* police. Since a total of 18 + 2 = 20 people were affected and 2 were police, that means 20 - 2 = 18 people were injured and 2 were killed (police). 

Therefore 18 people injured + 2 police killed = 20. To clarify, 18 people were injured including police. Two police officers died, leaving 18 other victims who were not police.
"
Ke mang ya tlalehileng melaellwa wa thlaselo?,"The correct answer is **A: Sepolesa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mapolesa a itse a belaella molwanedi wa Daesh (ISIL) bakeng sa boikarabello ba tlhaselo."" This directly translates to ""Police suspect a Daesh (ISIL) member of responsibility for the attack.""  Therefore, the police are the ones reporting the suspect.



"
"Ho latela maemo a tlholo ya bomemo bo hodimo ya Florida, Mitt Romney o hapile eng?","The correct answer is **C: Baemedi ba naha kaofeela**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jwalo ka profensi eo ho yona mohlodi a hapang tsohle, Florida e abetse bakgethwa bohle ba yona ba mashome a mahlano ho Romney..."" This directly translates to Florida awarding all of its 50 national delegates to Romney.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke karolo e kae lekgolong ya divoutu eo Gingrich a bileng le yona dikgethong tsa mathomo?","The correct answer is **B: Diperesente tse 32**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Sepikara sa mehleng sa Ntlo ya Baemedi ya Palamente ya naha ya U.S. Newt Gingrich se hlahile bobeding ka diphesente tse 32."""
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang a sa tswelang pele dikgethong kamora sephetho sa seboka?","The correct answer is **B: Bachmann**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Bachmann, ya hapileng Letsholo la Dipalopalo la Ames Straw ka Phato, o entse qeto ya ho fedisa letsholo la hae."" (Bachmann, who won the Ames Straw Poll in August, decided to end her campaign.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gingrich** - The text says Gingrich congratulated Santorum but had harsh words for Romney, implying he continues.
*   **C: Perry** - Perry initially said he'd return to Texas to assess, but then stated he would stay in the race and compete in South Carolina.
*   **D: Romney** - Romney is mentioned as the target of attacks but isn't said to be dropping out.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang a buileng ka mokgethwa e mong kamora sephetho sa seboka?","The correct answer is **B: Gingrich**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kamora hore diphetho di kene, Gingrich a thoholetsa Santorum, empa a ba le mantswe a bohale bakeng sa Romney..."" This directly indicates Gingrich spoke about others *after* the results came in.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bachmann:** The passage says she *ended* her campaign, not that she spoke about others.
*   **C: Romney:** The passage states Gingrich had harsh words *for* Romney, but doesn't say Romney spoke himself.
*   **D: Perry:** Perry spoke about returning to Texas to assess, but not about other candidates.



"
Ke sebaka sefeng se le seng feela seo lenaneo le ileng la hlaiswa pele ho selemo sa 2015?,"The correct answer is **A: Seyalemoya sa TogiNet**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Matsatsing a yona a qalong, lenaneo lena le ne le bontshwa setsing sa radiyo ya inthanete sa nako e telele sa TogiNet Radio...""  This clearly indicates the program was first broadcast on TogiNet Radio *before* 2015, when AstroNet Radio was founded.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Texas e bochabela:** This refers to the location of the voice actors, not the broadcasting station.
*   **C: Seyalemoya sa AstroNet:** AstroNet Radio was created *after* the program's initial broadcast.
*   **D: Diyalemoya tsa lehae:** While the program used local voice actors, that doesn't define where it was *broadcast* initially.



"
Seyalemoya se ne se hlalosa lenaneo ele la morethetho ofeng?,"The correct answer is **C: Wa kgale**.

Here's why:

The passage states the program is described as """"ke radiyo le teatere tsa kgale tse kopantsweng le thello e hlwahlwa bo makatsang e ntjha!"""" (""""a combination of old radio and theater with a surprisingly fresh depth!""""). This directly indicates a **kgale** (old) characteristic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wa maithutwana** - While it started on a radio station, the description doesn't focus on it being for students.
*   **B: Wa profeshenale** - The passage doesn't specify whether it's a professional production, just its style.
*   **D: Wa lehae** - While the initial actors were local, the program's overall character is described as ""old,"" not simply local.



"
David Headley o ile a fumana eng e ileng ya thusa tlhaselo entsweng ke marabele?,"The correct answer is **A: Tlhaiso-leseding** (Information).

The text states: ""Bosekaoti le pokeletso ya tlhahisoleseding ba David Headley bo ne bo thusitse ho kgonahatsa tshebetso…"" which translates to ""The confession and intelligence provided by David Headley helped facilitate the operation…"" 

Therefore, David Headley provided information that aided the attack.



"
Marabele a sebedisitse mofuta ofeng wa ho tsamaya ho ya Mumbai?,"The correct answer is **C: Seketswana**.

The text states: ""Bahlasedi ba Mumbai ba fihlile ka **seketswana** ka la 26 Pudungwana, 2008..."" This directly translates to ""The Mumbai attackers arrived **by boat** on November 26, 2008..."""
Ke polelo efeng seratswaneng e bontshang ka kotloloho sepheto sa Nadal Le Raonic papading ya Brisbane Open?,"The correct answer is **A: Raonic o hlola Nadal**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""O sa tswa lahlehelwa kgahlanong le Raonic mane thonamenteng ya Brisbane Open."" This directly translates to ""He just lost to Raonic in the Brisbane Open tournament.""  This means Raonic won against Nadal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Raonic o fumane dintlha tse 88%** - The text states Nadal won 88% of first serve points, not Raonic.
*   **C: Nadal o hlola Raonic** - The text explicitly says Nadal *lost* to Raonic.
*   **D: Raonic a hlaba dintlha tse 76** - The text says Nadal won 76 points, not Raonic.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, Nadal le Raonic ba ne ba le maemong afe kamora mokhahlelo wa pele?","The correct answer is **C: Sephetho e ne e le 7-2**.

The passage states ""Rekoto ya papiso ya Nadal kgahlanong le MoCanada eo ke 7–2."" This directly translates to ""Nadal's record against the Canadian was 7-2."" This is the score of the match.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Raonic o fumane dintlha tse 88%** - The text states Nadal won 88% of first serve points, not Raonic.
*   **B: Nadal a hapa lintlha tse 76** - This is true, but it doesn't describe the overall outcome of the match *between Nadal and Raonic*. It is the details *within* the match.
*   **D: Raonic a hlola Nadal** - The text clearly indicates Nadal won with a score of 7-2.



"
Ke lenaneho lefeng la puo le sa kenellang ho diphatlalatso tse tharo tsa Naked News?,"The correct answer is **A: Setadiana**.

Here's why:

The passage states Naked News *already* reports in English and Japanese and is *adding* Spanish, Italian, and Korean.  Therefore, Setadiana (Romanian) is the only language from the options *not* mentioned as being a current or future language of Naked News."
"Ho latela seratswana, phatlalatso e ntjha ya Naked News ha e na ho fumaneha kae?","The correct answer is **B: Marang-rang** (On the internet/web).

Here's why:

The passage states Naked News is expanding its publishing operation for television, **web**, and mobile devices. This means the new publications will be available online.  The other options are either too specific (cinemas) or already mentioned as platforms *along with* the web (television).

"
Ke dibapadi tse kae tse hlolehileng ho qeta tlholisano ya Giant Slalom?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

The text states: ""mme ba 45 kakaretsong ya bathellisi ba 117 ho Giant Slalom ba hlolehile ho fumana maemo lebelong lena."" This directly translates to ""and 45 of the 117 competitors in Giant Slalom failed to finish the race.""
"
"Ho tse latelang, ke polelo efeng e hlalosang hantle sephetho sa dipapadi tsa Bompodi?","The correct answer is **B: Dibapadi tsa lehlweng tse 45 ha di ya phethela mokgahlelo wa bona ho Giant Slalom**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""mme ba 45 kakaretsong ya bathellisi ba 117 ho Giant Slalom ba hlolehile ho fumana maemo lebelong lena."" which translates to ""and 45 of the 117 total skiers in Giant Slalom failed to finish the course.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The text states Carpenado finished *behind* the Hungarian skier, not ahead.
* **C:** The text only gives information about Carpenado's performance in both events, not a comparison of how many women finished each event.
* **D:** Carpenado did *not* finish the Slalom (DNF), so could not have placed tenth.



"
NBA e khethile ho fanyeha eng ho tse latelang?,"The correct answer is **A: Sehla sa basketball**.

Here's why:

The text states that the NBA *suspended its season* (sehla sa wona sa porofeshenale sa basketebolo) due to COVID-19 concerns. The other options are related to the *reason* for the suspension, but the question asks what the NBA *decided to suspend*.

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sebapadi sa Utah Jazz:** While the Jazz player was the catalyst, the NBA didn’t suspend *the player*, it suspended the season.
*   **C: Sebapadi sefeng kapa sefeng se fumanweng se na le bohloko ba COVID-19:** This is a condition that led to the suspension, not what was suspended.
*   **D: Sehlopha sa basketball sa Utah Jazz:** Similar to option B, the NBA didn't suspend the team, it suspended the season.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e entseng hore NBA e be le ngongoreho mabapi kokwana-hloko?","The correct answer is **D: Sebapadi sa Utah Jazz se fumanwe se na le COVID 19**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Qeto ya NBA e latetse kamora hore sebapadi sa Jazz sa Utah se fumanwe se na le vaerase ya COVID-19."" This means the discovery of a Utah Jazz player with COVID-19 is the direct reason for the NBA's concern.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ditho tsa NBA di fumanwe di na le COVID 19** - While true, the passage specifically highlights *a player* on the Utah Jazz.
* **B: Dibapadi tse mmalwa di fumanwe di ena le COVID 19 papading tsa Utah Jazz** - The passage only mentions *one* player.
* **C: Sebapadi sa Utah Jazz ha se ya bapala hantle kamora ho fumanwa se na le COVID 19** - This isn't mentioned in the passage. The issue is the virus itself, not the player's performance.



"
Ke mang ya hlabileng ntlha ya tlholo ya Washington Capitals kgahlanong le Atlanta Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **A: Nicklas Backstrom**.

The passage states: ""Thusetso ya pele ya Ovechkin ya phirimana e bile ntlheng e hapileng papadi e hlabilweng ke Nicklas Backstrom"" which translates to ""Ovechkin's first goal of the night was on a power play goal assisted by Nicklas Backstrom.""  This means Backstrom assisted on the game-winning goal."
Ke mang ya hlabileng nthla ya bo 60 papading ya Capitals le Thrasahers?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The text states: ""Ovechkin’s second goal of the night was his 60th of the season, making him the first player to score 60 or more goals in a season since 1995-96, when Jaromir Jagr and Mario Lemieux each reached the milestone."" 

This clearly indicates Ovechkin was the one who scored his 60th goal.  The text mentions Jagr and Lemieux as the last to do it *before* Ovechkin.



"
Banka ya Nothern Rock e hlokile tshehetso ya mmuso neng?,"The correct answer is **D: Nakong ya tlokotsi ya mekoloto** (During the credit crunch).

Here's why:

The text states that Northern Rock needed support *because* of the bad state of mortgage lending in 2007 (the credit crunch). This is the direct cause of their financial trouble and need for government assistance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kamorao hore banka ebe ya setjhaba** (After the bank became nationalized) - They needed support *before* being nationalized. Nationalization was a result of needing support.
*   **B: Ha banka e kgaohana le khampani ya ho laola matlotlo** (When the bank separated from the asset management company) - This happened *after* the initial need for support.
*   **C: Kamora hore Virgin group e reke banka** (After the Virgin Group bought the bank) - Virgin only bought a *part* of the bank, and only *after* it was nationalized.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke polelo efeng e hlalosang tshebelisano mmoho ya Virgin Group le banka ya Northern Rock?","The correct answer is **B: Virgin Group e ile ya reka banka kamorao hore e be ya setjhaba.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the Virgin Group's bid was rejected *before* the bank was nationalized.
*   It then clarifies that Virgin only bought the ""good bank"" *after* Northern Rock was nationalized in 2010.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** Incorrect. The passage explicitly says Virgin *did not* buy the company controlling the bad assets (Northern Rock (Asset Management)).
*   **C:** Incorrect. The passage says Virgin's bid was rejected *before* Northern Rock received government support.
*   **D:** Incorrect. Virgin’s interest came *after* the nationalization, as they bought the “good bank” in 2010 once it was already state-owned.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke setjhaba sefeng se angweng ke tekenelo ya setlamo sa Kyoto sa ditaba tsa boemo ba lehodimo?","The correct answer is **A: Amerika**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the US will be the *only* developed nation not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. It then goes on to mention Australia's refusal, but frames it as being similar to the US position, and highlights the different treatment of countries like India and China. 

Therefore, the passage identifies the United States as the nation singled out by the Kyoto Protocol's requirements.



"
Mmuso wa mehleng wa naha ya Australia o ne o nahanne hore ho phethahatsa setlamo sa Kyoto ho ka etsa tshenyo ho eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Moruo wa naha**.

The text states: ""Mmuso wa dinganyele (conservative) wa Australia o hanne ho tiisa Selekane sa Kyoto, ka hore se tla **senya moruo** ka lebaka la boitshetleho bo matla hodima diromelwantle tsa mashala...""

This directly translates to the conservative government believing that adhering to the Kyoto Protocol would damage the Australian economy."
Ke lenaneo lefeng leo dibapadi tsa ho thunya tselaneng ba ileng ba le bitseswa?,"The correct answer is **D: Lenaneo la mokgatlo wa dipapadi tsa bo-Rasethunya**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Selekaneng sa NPWS le Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, baithaopi ba tshwanelehang ba thaothilwe, **tlasa lenaneo la ditsomi la Sporting Shooters Association.**"" 

This directly links the training program to the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia. While NPWS is involved, the training itself is *under* the Sporting Shooters Association's program.



"
Ke polelo efeng e sa hlaloseng ka nepo diteko tsa ho laola dikokonyana tse senyang dijalo?,"The correct answer is **A: Jwalo kaha ene ele teko ya pele ya lenaneo,ha eya ka ya hlahlojwa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on a *successful* trial.** It states the trial was successful and properly monitored by rangers. Option A implies the trial wasn't properly assessed (""ha eya ka ya hlahlojwa"" - it wasn't properly looked at/reviewed), which contradicts the information given.  It's a statement *about* the trial, but a contradictory one.
* **Options B, C, and D are all stated facts within the passage:**
    * **B:** The passage says the shooters received safety training.
    * **C:** The passage says the shooters were guided by rangers.
    * **D:** The passage states four shooters were selected.

Therefore, option A is the statement that doesn't align with the information presented in the text and therefore is the one that doesn’t accurately describe the trial.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, karohano e fumanwe kae?","The correct answer is **D: Ethiopia**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Berhane Asfaw is a ""research scientist with the Rift Valley Research Service **in Ethiopia**"". He's the one making the statement about the split being older than previously thought, and the context implies the fossil was found *in* Ethiopia through his work.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rift Valley** - While the research service is named after the Rift Valley, the text doesn't state the split was *found* there, but rather the scientist works *within* the region.
*   **B: Ho mesalla ya dintho tsa kgale** (In layers of ancient things/fossils) - This is where the fossil *is*, but it doesn’t specify where the split was found.
*   **C: Ho ya ka bopaki ba molekhule** (According to molecular evidence) - The passage states the split is *older than* what was previously determined by molecular evidence, it doesn’t say the split itself was found *according* to that evidence.



"
"Ho latela seratswana see,ke eng e etsahetseng pele ho nako eneng e lebeletswe?","The correct answer is **B: Karohano (Separation/Split)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ho ipapisitswe le fossil ena, sena se bolela hore karohano e bile pele haholo ho nako e neng e lekantswe ke bopaki ba dimolikhule."" This translates to: ""Based on this fossil, it means the separation occurred much earlier than the time estimated by molecular evidence.""

Therefore, the fossil discovery indicates that a split/separation event happened *before* the previously estimated time based on molecular evidence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho fumaneha ha masalla a lintho tsa khale (Discovery of fossils)** - While a fossil *led* to the conclusion, it wasn't what happened *before* the estimated time.
*   **C: Ho hlahloba bopaki ba molekhule (Examining molecular evidence)** - This is the method used for the original time estimate, not something that happened before it.
*   **D: Diphuputso sebakeng sa Rift Valley (Research in the Rift Valley area)** - This is where the research took place, not the event itself.



"
Sebapadi se lokela ho etsa jwang hore se etse dithlaselo papading ya video?,"The correct answer is **D: Tsamaisa controller moeeng**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that the controller allows players to control actions in video games by *moving the device through the air*. Options A, B, and C relate to setting up the sensor, but the *action* of controlling the game happens by moving the controller.



"
Ke eng e neng e etseditswe ho shebahala jwalo ka remoutu ya thelefishene?,"The correct answer is **A: Disensara tse pedi tsa ho tsamaisa**.

Here's why:

The passage states the controller ""se tshwanang le remoutu ya thelevishene"" (resembles a television remote) and that it used ""disensara tse pedi tse behwang pela thelevishene ya mosebedisi ho laola tulo ya yona sebakeng sa dikgutlo tse tharo"" (two sensors placed in front of the user's television to control its position in three-dimensional space).  This makes the sensors the key feature that gave it the remote-like appearance and functionality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Setsamaisi sa Nintendo Revolution:** The passage refers to the *controller* for the Revolution, not the console itself.
*   **C: Porisentheishene ya mantlha:** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Console ya Nintendo Revolution:**  The console isn't the thing resembling a remote, it's the controller *for* the console.



"
Ke eng esa bolelwang ditlalehong tsa moraorao tsa lefapha la ditaba la Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **D: Sefofane se ile sa tsorama Kandahar**.

The passage states: ""Ha morao ditlaleho di boletse hore sefofane se fumane tshosetso ya bomo mme sa kgeloswa ho kgutlela morao Afghanistan, sa tsorama Kandahar."" This directly translates to ""Later reports said the plane received a bomb threat and was allowed to return to Afghanistan, landing in Kandahar.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sefofane se fumane tshoso ya seqhomane** - While true, this is only *part* of what the later reports said, not the complete information.
*   **B: Sefofane se ile sa tsorama Urimqi** - The passage states it was *denied* landing in Ürümqi (Urimqi).
*   **C: sefofane se ile sa lebiswa Afghanistan** - It was *allowed* to return to Afghanistan, not ""led"" there. Also, Kandahar is a specific location within Afghanistan.



"
Ke eng eneng esa bolelwa ditlalehong tsa mathomo tsa lefapha le letjha la Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **A: Sefofane se ile sa kwetelwa**.

The passage states, ""Pejana lekalana la ditaba la China Xinhua le tlalehile hore sefofane se kwetetswe."" This means the initial report from Xinhua said the plane was intercepted.
"
Ke eng e ileng ya tlalehwa ke Sara Danius seyalemoyeng ka nako ya lenaneo?,"The correct answer is **B: Komiti ha e a fumana dikarabo hotswa ho bo mphato ba bona**.

Here's why:

The passage states Danius said, """"Hajwale ha re etse letho. Ke letsitse le ho romela diimeile ho mosebeletsani ya haufi ka ho fetisisa le yena mme ka fumana dikarabo tsa botswalle."""" This directly translates to the committee not receiving a response from Dylan or his representatives.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mohlodi wa kgau e ikgethang ho dingodilweng** - While she *is* associated with the Nobel Prize in Literature, the passage isn't reporting her announcement *of* the winner, but rather about the difficulties in contacting the winner.
*   **C: Bakgethwa ba selemo sa 2016 ba kgau e ikgethang ya dingodilweng** - The passage discusses the challenges of reaching Bob Dylan, the winner, not the announcement of the winner itself.
*   **D: Komiti e tla tlohela ho etsa dikgato tsa ho kopana le Bob Dylan** - Danius said they had stopped *for now* (""Bakeng sa hajwale, sena se lekane.""), not that they'd given up completely.



"
Ke mang ya neng a sa fumanehe?,"The correct answer is **D: Bob Dylan**.

The passage explicitly states that the Nobel Committee was unable to reach Bob Dylan directly. While Sara Danius attempted to contact him through his closest associate, the core issue is that *Dylan* was the one who was unreachable.



"
Ke mang a faneng ka maikutlo a boitlamo ba “kgatelo pele e kgolo”?,"The correct answer is **C: Gordon Johndroe**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Sebui sa Bush Gordon Johndroe o bitsitse boitlamo ba naha ya Korea Leboya """"mohato o moholo mekutung ya ho fihlella phediso ya dibetsa tsa nutlelia koung ya Korea."""""".  This means Gordon Johndroe (Bush's spokesperson) was the one who made the statement about the ""kgatelo pele e kgolo"" (major step).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baphatlalatsi:** The text doesn't mention any other publishers making the statement.
*   **B: George W. Bush:** While the president approved the announcement, it was his spokesperson who *made* the statement.
*   **D: Sebuelli sa North Korea:** The statement is *about* North Korea, not *from* North Korea.



"
Słania o entse ditempe tse kae tsa dinaha tse fapaneng?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka hodimo ho 1,000**.

Here's why:

The passage states Słania created ""more than 1,000 stamps from Sweden and 28 from other countries.""  This means he created *over* 1,000 stamps for other countries in addition to the Swedish stamps.  Therefore, the total number of stamps from different countries is over 1,000.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tse ka hodimo ho 2,000:** While the total number of stamps he created is likely over 2,000 (1,000+ Swedish + 28 others), the question specifically asks about stamps from *different countries*, and the text only gives us a definitive number of 28 + for other countries.
*   **B: Tse 1000:** He made 28 stamps from other countries, not 1000.
*   **C: Bonyane 2,000:** The passage does not state a minimum number but says 'more than 1,000'."
"Ho ya ka seratswana, sesosa se tswelapeleng sa ho dutla ha difente tsa ditanka e ka nna ya ba sefeng?","The correct answer is **C: Katoloso ya motjheso** (Expansion of pressure).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""masobana a tanka a ne a sa ntse a dutla, *mohlomong ka lebaka la ho kokomoswa ke motjheso ka hare ho tanka*."" This directly translates to ""tank vapors were still expanding, *possibly due to pressure buildup inside the tank*."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sebaka sa bobedi sa poloko ya dintho tse ka bang kotsi mosebetsing se tlatsitswe tswete** - The text says the *second containment area was not completely filled*, not that it was full.
*   **B: Diteko tse tlwaehileng tsa tsamaiso ya tlhokomediso ya mollo wa tshohanyetso** - The passage states the leak happened *after* a routine test, but the test isn’t directly linked to the tank vapors expanding.
*   **D: Mollo ho e nngwe ya diteishene tsa dipompo tsa Fort Greely** - The passage doesn't mention any fire.



"
Hobaneng dipompo di ile tsa buleha?,"The correct answer is **B: Ho bile le ho kgaoha hwa motlakase kamora ho etsa diteko tsa metjhine**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ho kgaoha ha motlakase kamora teko ya tlwaelo ya sistimi ho bakile hore divalefo di bulehe mme oli e tala ya tsholoha..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't mention temperature fluctuations.
* **C:** The passage doesn't mention the tanks being full of something.
* **D:** While a secondary containment area *didn't fill completely*, it wasn't the *cause* of the valves opening.



"
"Ha jwale, metsi a bophahamo bo bokae Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **A: Bohato ba maoto a 20**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Wate ya Borobong, e boneng dikgohola tsa bophahamo ba maoto a 20 nakong ya Sefefo sa Katrina, hajwale e na le metsi a bophahamong ba letheka moo levee e haufinyane e tlotsweng ke metsi."" This means the water level is currently at 20 feet, the same height it reached during Hurricane Katrina. The information about the breached levee and 6 inches of rain is irrelevant to the current water height."
"Ka nako ya leholiotswana la Katarina, ho etsahetseng Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **C: Metsi a dikhohola a ne a le bophahamong ba bohato ba maoto a 20.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Wate ya Borobong, e boneng dikgohola tsa bophahamo ba maoto a 20 nakong ya Sefefo sa Katrina...""  This directly tells us the floodwaters reached a height of 20 feet during Katrina.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage states the breach was 100 feet *wide*, not that the water was 100 feet high.
*   **B:** The passage doesn't mention the water being ""deep enough to drown a person"" or breaching the levee, just that it went *over* it.
*   **D:** The passage says 6 inches of rain *could* breach levees, but it doesn't say this happened during Katrina. It's a statement about future risk.



"
Ke ntho efeng ho tse latelang e sa netefatswang ke Hamilton?,"The correct answer is **B: Khonahalo ya hore bakudi ba bang ba tshwaetswe ke kokwana-hloko**.

Here's why:

The passage states Hamilton *followed protocol to prevent potential spread*. This means they took precautions *as if* there was a risk of transmission, but it doesn't confirm that any transmission *actually* happened. 

Let's look at why the other options are confirmed by the passage:

*   **A: Moo mokudi a tsamaileng** - The passage explicitly states the patient traveled to Nigeria.
*   **C: Ho re na methati e nepahetseng e latetswe** - The passage says the hospital ""followed protocol.""
*   **D: Maemo a hajwale a mokudi** - The passage states the patient was in ""stable condition.""



"
Ke ntho efeng eo bo-ramahlale ba batlang ho e bona?,"The correct answer is **D: Lefatshe le thehilwe jwang** (How Earth was formed).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Borasaense ba tshepa ho utlwisisa ka moo dipolanete di thomehang ka teng, **haholoholo ka moo Lefatshe le thomehileng**, haesale dikhomete di thulana le Lefatshe nako e telele e fetileng.""  This directly translates to: ""Scientists are trying to understand how planets form, **especially how Earth formed**, as comets collided with Earth a long time ago.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ha mechochonono e thulana le Lefatshe** (When comets collided with Earth) - This is *related* to the topic, but not the primary thing scientists are trying to understand. It's a piece of the puzzle.
*   **B: Ho re na diporotheine di thehilwe jwang** (How proteins are formed) - The passage mentions proteins being formed from organic matter, but scientists aren’t *primarily* trying to understand *how* proteins are formed, but rather the conditions that allowed them to form on Earth.
*   **C: Ho re na manyolo ke eng** (What brains are) - This is completely unrelated to the passage.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke karolo efeng eo mapolesa a lehae a e bapetseng ho etsa mokwallo?","The correct answer is **A: Ba khothaleditse FBI ho etsa mokwallo** (They recommended the FBI to investigate).

Here's why:

The passage states ""Maryland Transportation Authority e kwetse phuputso ka ho kgothaletsa FBI"" which translates to ""Maryland Transportation Authority requested an investigation by recommending it to the FBI."" This directly indicates the local police (through the Maryland Transportation Authority) *recommended* the FBI investigate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ba ile ba etsa qeto ya ho iketsetsa mokwallo** (They decided to conduct the investigation themselves): The passage says they *recommended* the FBI do it, not that they did it themselves.
*   **C: Ba laetse bo-ramakoloi ho sebedisa ditsela tse ding** (They ordered drivers to use other routes): The passage mentions using trucks to block roads, but doesn't say they directed drivers elsewhere.
*   **D: Ba ile ba tlaleha tshetiso ya sephethethe tseleng e nngwe** (They reported traffic congestion on one road): While there was traffic, the main action described is requesting an FBI investigation.



"
Ho etsahetseng ka ditjhubu nakong eo ho neng ho kwalwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Di ile tsa kwalwa** (They were blocked).

Here's why:

The text states, ""Dilori tsa matlakala di sebedisitswe ho thibela menyako ya tjhubu..."" which translates to ""Dump trucks were used to block access to the tunnels...""  This means the tunnels were *blocked*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Di ile tsa sebediswa e le tsela e potolohang** (They were used as a detour) - The text doesn't mention the tunnels being used for anything.
* **C: Di ne di sebediswa ke bo-ramakoloi** (They were used by motorists) - The trucks *blocked* the tunnels, they weren't used *by* motorists.
* **D: Ho ne ho na le sephethephethe se sengata haholo ka pele** (There was a lot of congestion beforehand) - While congestion was managed *after* the tunnels were blocked, the text doesn't state congestion was excessive *before*.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, keng e sa kang ya etsahala pele radifoto a qetelle a thutswe ke koloi?","The correct answer is **A: Radifoto o ile a laelwa ke balaodi ba sephethephethe ho kgutlela morao**.

Here's why:

The text states that the photographer stopped their car and attempted to take pictures of the police. The police *then* told him to pull over and leave, twice. This means being told to pull over (kgutlela morao) happened *after* he stopped and started taking pictures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** Radifoto o ile a paka koloi ya hae mmileng o moholo wa Sepulveda Boulevard - The text clearly states he *did* park on Sepulveda Boulevard.
*   **C:** Ralifoto o ile a nka dinepe tsa letshwao la kemiso la mapolesa a tseleng - The text says he *tried* to take pictures of the police, implying he attempted it.
*   **D:** Radifoto o ile a atleha ho nka senepe sa Bieber - The text doesn't mention if he successfully took a picture of Bieber. It only says he was at the hospital where Bieber was.



"
Radifoto o ne a leka ho etsa eng pele a ka thulwa ke koloi?,"The correct answer is **B: O ile a nka dinepe tsa letshwao la kemiso la mapolesa a tseleng**.

The text states: ""raditshwantsho o emisitse koloi ya hae lehlakoreng le leng la Sepulveda Boulevard mme a leka ho nka ditshwantsho tsa mapolesa ha a emisa pele a tshela tsela le ho tswela pele..."" This directly translates to him trying to take pictures of the police.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: O ile a paka tseleng ya Sepulveda Boulevard:** While he *did* park on Sepulveda Boulevard, that wasn't his main action before being pulled over – he was trying to take pictures.
*   **C: Ho tshela tseleng e sephethephete:** He was trying to go through the checkpoint, but the text focuses on his attempt to take pictures *while* doing so.
*   **D: Ho khodisa lepolesa hore le motlohelle a nke dinepe:** The text doesn't say he was *trying* to make the police pose for photos, just that he was taking pictures of them."
Ke polelo e feng e sa hlaloseng ka nepo maemo a Moporesitente kamora ho fumanwa a na le tshwaetso?,"The correct answer is **A: Ha ikutlwe a le monate**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ho fapana le feberu le mmetso, ke ikutlwa hantle mme ke itekanetse ho ka phetha mosebetsi wa ka ka boikopanyo ba mehala."" This translates to: ""Unlike fever and chills, I feel well and am prepared to do my job remotely.""  This directly indicates the President *does not* feel unwell, making ""Ha ikutlwe a le monate"" (He doesn't feel well) the statement that *doesn't* accurately describe his condition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: O na le qoqotho e bohloko (He has a sore throat):** The text doesn't mention a sore throat.
*   **C: O maemong a nepahetseng (He is in a stable condition):** The president feels well enough to work remotely which suggests a stable condition.
*   **D: O na le feberu (He has a fever):** The text *specifically* states he does *not* have a fever (""Ho fapana le feberu..."").



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke polelo e feng e leng nnete ka Moporesitente?","The correct answer is **A: Ha a na feberu** (He doesn't have a fever).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ho fapana le feberu le mmetso, ke ikutlwa hantle"" which translates to ""Unlike fever and cough, I feel well."" This directly indicates he does *not* have a fever.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: O tla dula hae dibeke tse mmalwa** (He will stay home for weeks) - The text says ""nako ya matsatsi a mmalwa"" (a few days), not weeks.
*   **C: O maemong a hantle hore a ka bua ka fono** (He is in a condition to speak on the phone) - While he feels well enough to work remotely, the text doesn't specifically mention his ability to speak on the phone.
*   **D: O maemong a hlobaetsang ka lebaka la kokwana-hloko** (He is in a deteriorating condition due to headache) - The text doesn't mention a headache or a deteriorating condition. He is recovering, not worsening.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, lehoduotswana Gonu le ne le lebelletswe hore le tswelepele ho fokotseha neng?","The correct answer is **B: Ha sekgahla sa moya se ne se theohela ho foka ka dikhilomethara tse 83 ka hora**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hoseng kajeno, meya e ne e foka ka lebelo le ka bang 83 km/h, **mme ne e lebeletswe hore e tla tswela pele ho fokotseha.**""  This directly links the expectation of decreasing wind speeds to when the wind was at 83 km/h.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pele le ka fihla Maldives** - The passage doesn't link the weakening to reaching the Maldives, only to the current wind speed.
*   **C: Pele le ka fihlela sehlohlolong lona** - The passage doesn't mention weakening *before* reaching the eye.
*   **D: Pele hoba le moya o fokang ka sekgahla sa di maele tse 149** - This refers to the peak wind speed of the cyclone, not the weakening forecast.



"
Meya e ne le sekgahla se sekae ha lohoduotswana Gonu le fihlela sehlohlolong?,"The correct answer is **C: Dimmaele tse 149 ka hora**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...se fihletse meya e phehellang ya lebelo la dikhilomitara tse 240 ka hora (dimmaele tse 149 ka hora).""  This directly translates to the peak winds reaching 149 mph when Cyclone Gonu hit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dikilomethara tse 149 ka hora:** This is kilometers per hour, but the question asks for the speed in miles per hour.
*   **B: Dimmaele tse 240 ka hora:**  240 mph is the speed in kilometers converted to miles, but it is not the peak wind speed described in the text.
*   **D: Dikhilomithara tse 83 ka hora:** This was the wind speed *earlier* in the morning, not when the cyclone made landfall.



"
Ho tse latelang ke efeng tshobotsi esa nkuweng ele ya sebopuwa se senyenyane se bitswang Karenia brevis?,"The correct answer is **A: Ke mofuta wa bolele**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states ""Leqhubu le lefubedu le bakwa ke maemo a phahameng ka tsela e sa tlwaelehang a **Karenia brevis**, e leng sehodilweng se bang teng ka tlhaho sa sele e le nngwe lewatleng.""  This translates to ""The red tide and bloom are caused by unusually high levels of **Karenia brevis**, a naturally occurring single-celled algae in the ocean.""  Therefore, Karenia brevis *is* a type of bloom.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: E ka etsa hore methapo ya batho e se sebetse (It can cause people's muscles to stop working):** While the passage mentions harmful effects on people, it specifically states they are caused by *inhaling* toxins, not muscle paralysis.
* **C: E disele di ngata (It kills many fish):**  The passage states fish die due to high toxin levels, but doesn't define *Karenia brevis* as simply ""killing many fish."" It's the toxin that's the direct cause.
* **D: E etsahala ka tlholeho (It happens naturally):** While the passage says Karenia brevis is naturally occurring, it doesn’t define the organism itself as simply ""occurring naturally."" It's a descriptor of where it comes from.



"
Ho tse latelang ke eng eo Karenia brevis e sitwang etsa?,"The correct answer is **D: Ho hlahisa tjhefu** (To produce toxins).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that *Karenia brevis* produces toxins that can harm both people and marine life. The entire problem describes the effects of these toxins causing red tide and resulting in fish kills and potential harm to humans.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho etsa hore methapo ya litlhapi e se ke ya sebetsa** (To cause fish nets to not work) - The text doesn't mention anything about affecting fishing nets.
*   **B: Ho eketseha ka sekgahla tlasa maemo afe kapa afe** (To proliferate under any conditions) - The passage says *Karenia brevis* proliferates under *specific* conditions (natural factors combining).
*   **C: Ho ama metsi** (To affect water) - While it's true the organism is *in* the water, the problem focuses on the toxins it *creates* that affect the water and organisms within it.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e sa etsahalang ka lebaka la lehodiotswana la Felicia?","The correct answer is **D: Dikgohola tsa tseleng** (Landslides).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""E nngwe ya pula e ne e tsamaya le dikgohola tsa diaduma le mahadima a phehellang."" This translates to ""Some of the rain was accompanied by landslides and flash floods.""  The question asks what *did not* happen. While landslides *did* happen, the passage says there was *no reported damage*. This means the landslides didn't cause any harm.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pula e molemo (Good rain):** The passage explicitly states the rain was considered ""good"" (""molemo"").
*   **B: Pula e latelwang ke seaduma (Rain followed by lightning):** The passage mentions thunderstorms (""dikgohola tsa diaduma"") alongside the rain, meaning lightning *did* accompany the rain.
*   **C: Lehadima le iphetang (Flash floods):** The passage explicitly mentions ""mahadima a phehellang"" which means flash floods *did* occur.



"
Ke polelo e feng e seng nnete ka lehoduotswana la Felicia?,"The correct answer is **B: E ile ya qala pele e tlalehwa e le mofuta o monyane wa lehoduotswana pele e ka ba mokhahlelong wa 4 wa sefefo.**

Here's why:

The passage states Felicia *weakened* *from* a Category 4 hurricane. This means it *started* as a Category 4, not the other way around. Option B states it began as a smaller type of storm *before* becoming a Category 4, which is the opposite of what the text says.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: Pula e tlileng kamorao e ile ya tswela Oahu molemo** - The text specifically says the rainfall was described as ""molemo"" (good) for Oahu.
*   **C: Boholo ba dihlekehleke di ile tsa fumana pula** - The passage states the storm produced showers ""over much of the islands.""
*   **D: Pula e nngwe e ne na ka lehadima** - The text confirms that some of the rain was accompanied by lightning and flash floods.



"
Ke polelo e feng e hlalosang ka nepo sephetho sa Grand Prix ya Hungarian ya selemo sa 2009?,"The correct answer is **C: Piquet Jr. o ile a tebelwa ha morao** (Piquet Jr. was penalized).

The passage states: ""Piquet Jr. o ile a tebelwa kamora mojaho wa 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix."" This directly translates to ""Piquet Jr. was penalized after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fernado Alonso o ile a ameha kotsing** (Fernando Alonso was involved in a crash) - The passage doesn't mention Alonso being in a crash at the Hungarian Grand Prix.
*   **B: Piquet Jr. o ile a hlola** (Piquet Jr. won) - The passage says he was penalized, not that he won.
*   **D: Koloi ya tshireletso e ile ya ameha kotsing** (The safety car was involved in a crash) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the safety car being involved in a crash.



"
Kotsi e ile ya etsahala neng?,"The correct answer is **A: Hang ka mora hore Alonso a pote setopong sa papali**.

Here's why:

The passage states the accident happened *after* Alonso's ""pit stop"" (setopong sa papali) and *caused* the safety car to be deployed. This directly matches option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ha makoloi a mang a ntse a tshela mafura:** While this happened *during* the situation, it wasn't when the accident itself occurred. It was a consequence of the accident.
* **C: Pele koloi ya pholoso e fihla:** The accident *triggered* the safety car, not happened before it arrived.
* **D: kamora hore Piquet a lebe ho ya tshela mafura:** Piquet's refueling is irrelevant to *when* the accident took place.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke e feng ho tse latelang e nkileng nako e khutshwane ho feta ka moo bo ralipatlisiso ba neng ba lebeletse?","The correct answer is **A: Tlholeho ya dintho tse phelang (Evolution of living things)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""leha tshebetso ena ho dumelwa hore e nka nako e telele haholo"" (even though this process was believed to take a very long time). This refers to the evolution of a new species. The research found that this evolution happened *faster* than expected, originating in only two generations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ho tlaleha ka dintho tse phelang (Reporting on living things):** The passage talks about reporting the *discovery* of a new species, not the speed of the reporting process.
*   **C: Ho tswadisa dintho tse phelang (Breeding of living things):** The passage doesn't mention anything about breeding. It's about natural evolution.
*   **D: Ntshetso pele yha dintho tse phelang (Discovery of living things):** While the discovery is mentioned, the key point of the passage is about the speed of the evolutionary process itself.



"
Ke e feng ya dintho tse latelang tse neng di sa tlalehwa ke bo ralipatlisiso?,"The correct answer is **A: Hore na dintho tse phelang di simolohile kae** (Where living things originated).

Here's why:

*   The passage focuses on the **discovery of a new bird species** within the Galapagos Islands, and how it originated from *existing* finch species (Geospiza fortes and Geospiza conirostris) through hybridization. It doesn't discuss the *original* origin of life itself.
*   **B: Bolelele ba ntshetso pele ya dintho tse phelang** (The length of time it took for living things to evolve) - The passage *mentions* that the hybridization process takes a very long time, but doesn't provide a specific timeframe for the overall evolution of life.
*   **C: Mabitso a dintho tse phelang tse ntjha** (The names of new living things) - It explicitly states the names of the involved finch species.
*   **D: Dinonyana tse amehileng katisong ya tsona** (The birds involved in their hybridization) - It directly names the two finch species that hybridized to create the new bird.

Therefore, the passage does *not* report on where life originated, making **A** the correct answer."
Ketsahalo ya “CowParade” e tla etsahala hokae?,"The correct answer is **B: Toropong ya Bucharest**.

The text specifically states that Bucharest will be the first city in Southeastern Europe to host CowParade. It doesn't mention it happening in multiple cities in Romania or other parts of Europe.



"
Ke polelwana e feng ho tse latelang e hlalosang hantle “CowParade”?,"The correct answer is **D: Ke ketsahalo e kgolo ya bonono lefatsheng ka bophara**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states directly:** ""CowParade, e leng ketsahalo ya bonono e kgolo ka ho fetisisa lefatsheng ya setjhaba..."" (CowParade, which is the largest international art event in the world...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While it happens in cities with creativity, the passage doesn't *define* it as needing ""creativity"" specifically.
* **B:** It's happening *in* Bucharest, but that's not its definition.
* **C:** While it's in Southeastern Europe and during summer, the passage emphasizes it's a *global* event, not just regional.



"
Keng se bakileng hore naha ya Russia e fanyehe tshebeliso ya sefofane sa moetso wa II-76s?,"The correct answer is **B: Kotsi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Russia e ile ya thibela difofane tsa Il-76 ho fofa kamora kotsi ena."" (Russia banned Il-76 flights after this accident). This directly links the suspension of use to a recent accident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mabotho a kahare** - While internal forces were involved in the incident, they didn't *cause* the ban on flights.
*   **C: Sesole sa Soviet** - The Soviet army's use of the plane is historical context, not the reason for the current ban.
*   **D: Dipatlisiso tse emisitsweng** - Investigations were *started* because of the incident, not the cause of the ban itself.



"
II-76 keng?,"The correct answer is **C: Sefofane se tsamayang moyeng** (Airplane).

The text clearly states: ""Sefofane sena sa Il-76..."" which translates to ""This Il-76 airplane...""  The passage then describes it flying, having engines, and being involved in a plane crash. Therefore, it's an airplane.



"
Ke mang ya hirileng sehlopha se ngolang lenaneo la “The Simpsons”?,"The correct answer is **B: Simon**.

The passage states: ""In 1989 he helped create The Simpsons with Brooks and Groening, and he was responsible for hiring the show’s original writing staff."" 

Therefore, Simon was responsible for hiring the writing staff."
"Ho latela Fluke, ke mang ya neng a mo romella maikutlo a matle le kgothatso?","The correct answer is **D: Banna le basadi ka bo mong**.

The text explicitly states Fluke received ""feelings and encouragement...from both women and men"" supporting access to contraception for medical use. Therefore, both men and women sent him positive feedback and encouragement."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng seo batho ba bang ba neng ba sa se thabele ha basadi ba bua ka sona?","The correct answer is **C: Bophelo bo botle ba basadi**.

The passage states that some people tried to pressure women to *not talk about* their wellbeing (bophelo bo botle ba basadi). This is the very thing the passage identifies as the subject of the attempted suppression.



"
"Hoya ka Seratswana, ke efe polanete e mahlahahlaha?","The correct answer is **B: Thaethene**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""...sebopeho sa polanete e le nngwe e bontshang diphetophetoho haholwanyane ho feta Lefatshe,"" (a planet that shows fewer changes than Earth).  Stofan is referring to Titan (Thaethene in Setswana), a moon of Saturn, which has a dense atmosphere and liquids (methane and ethane) on its surface, creating a very clear ""surface"" for seeing through, similar to water. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lefatshe (Earth):** The passage explicitly says the other planet shows *fewer* changes than Earth.
*   **C: Letsatsi (Sun):** The Sun is a star, not a planet, and is not something you could ""see through"" to the seabed.
*   **D: Mmanaane (Venus):** Venus has a very thick, opaque atmosphere; you couldn't see through it.



"
Ke polaneteng efeng moo ho ileng hwa bonahala dinoka le matsha ana le ntho etsweu e metsi?,"The correct answer is **B: Thaethene**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a planet with characteristics similar to water – transparency, ability to see through it to the seafloor, and subtle surface features. This is a direct reference to Titan (Thaethene in Sesotho).  Titan is known to have lakes and rivers of liquid methane and ethane, and its atmosphere allows for a degree of visibility through these liquids.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **Tosa:** This isn't a recognized planet.
*   **Letsatsi (Sun):** The Sun is a star, not a planet, and is composed of gas - not liquid.
*   **Mmanaane (Mars):** While Mars has some water ice, it doesn't have extensive liquid bodies like the description suggests, and its surface isn't known for transparency.

"Ho tse latelang, ke diphuputso di feng tseo eseng liphetho tsa ho sibollwa hwa masiba?","The correct answer is **D: Ho netefatsa hore boholo ba dikgodumodumo di ne di na le masiba.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sena se ha se bolele feela hore didaenosara tse ding di ne di na le masiba, e leng kutlwisiso e se ntse e pharaletse...""  This indicates the *existence* of feathers on dinosaurs was *already* a widely held understanding. The research isn't establishing this for the first time; it's building *upon* this established idea.  It's looking at details *within* that context.

Let's look at why the other options are things the research *is* investigating:

* **A: Mmala wa masiba diphoofolong:** The passage specifically mentions scientists determining the color of the feathers (""mmala o mosootho ba chestnut kahodimo le bokatlase bo lerootho kapa """"carotenoid"""""").
* **B: Kutlowisiso ya hore masiba haa sebeliswe lifofaneng:** The text discusses how the feather structure suggests they weren’t for flight but for display or thermoregulation.
* **C: Dikateng tsa tshimoloho ya masiba:**  The discussion about the ""rachis"" and other feather structures relates to understanding the *evolution* of feathers.



Therefore, option D is the only one that represents something the research isn't trying to *discover* but rather is working *from* as a pre-existing concept."
Ke eng eo masiba a kgodumodumo a neng a se na yona?,"The correct answer is **B: Karolo ya lesiba e bitswang rachis**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Hobane masiba a daenosara ha a na moqala o tiileng, o bitswang """"rachis"""", empa e na le dibopeho tse ding tsa masiba…"" (Because the dinosaur's leaves did not have a strong central stalk, called a ""rachis"", but had other leaf structures...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Karolo ya lesiba e bitswang barblues:** This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Masiba a nonyanana e hodileng:** The text actually says the leaves were *not* small (""masiba a e kgolo, e seng tsuonyana"").
*   **D: Mmala o khanyang, katlaase:** The text describes the color as a chestnut brown on top and a dark or ""carotenoid"" green, not a bright, green color.



"
Ke polelo efeng eseng nnete ka setlhare sa ZMapp?,"The correct answer is **A: Se entswe ka dithibela mafu (It is made of antibodies)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ZMapp is a ""mixture of antibodies"" (motswako o mong wa masole a mmele). While antibodies *fight* infection, they are not the same as vaccines. Vaccines *prevent* infection.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **B: Se ka phekola tswhaetso empa eseng ho thibela lefu (It can treat infection but not prevent death)** - The passage says it shows promise in *reducing* mortality, implying it treats the infection, but doesn’t completely prevent death.
*   **C: Se ile sa sebetsa ele taolo nakong ya diteko tsa PALM (It served as a control during the PALM trials)** - The passage explicitly states it was used as a control group: ""ZMapp e sebeditse jwalo ka letsoho la taolo…""
*   **D: Boithuto bo bontsha melemo ya sona e fokola hofeta kamoo ho neng ho lebeletswe (Studies show its benefits are less than expected)** -  The passage states ""diphuputso tsa semolao di bontshitse hore o na le molemo o tlase ho feta o batlehang bakeng sa ho thibela ho shwa"" (formal studies have shown it has less benefit than desired for preventing death).



"
"Dipolelong tsee, ke e feng e hlalosang ka botlalo teko ya PALM?","The correct answer is **B: Setlhare se alafang se ile sa bapiswa le tse ling tse phekolang mme hara tsona e ne le setlhare sa ZMapp**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control arm, meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other therapies to it."" This directly indicates that the PALM trial involved comparing a treatment (the investigational therapies) *to* ZMapp. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Boithuto bo sibolotse hore e ka nna ya ba le melemo e mengata ho feta kamoo ho neng ho lebeletswe** - The passage does *not* say the study exceeded expectations, only that ZMapp's benefits were lower than desired.
* **C: Setlhare sa ZMapp se sebelisitswe qetellong ya diteko** - The passage states it was used as a baseline *during* the trial for comparison.
* **D: E bonahetse e sebetsa hantle ho phekola maemo a renang** - The passage actually says ZMapp's benefits were *lower than desired* for preventing death.



"
Ke hokae moo bo-radiphuputso ba nahanang hore tjhipi e ka ba bohlokwa haholo?,"The correct answer is **A: Dinaha tse fumanang thjelete e tlaase**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that the new diagnostic tool could bring ""phumano e ntjha e sa le qalong haholo bakeng sa kankere, lefuba, HIV le malaria bakuding ba dinaheng tse nang le moruo o tlase"" (early new detection for cancer, tuberculosis, HIV and malaria in patients in low-income countries). It also highlights the difference in survival rates for diseases like breast cancer between low-income and wealthy countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dinaha tse ruileng:** The passage contrasts the situation in wealthy countries with that of low-income countries, implying the benefit is *greater* in the former.
*   **C: Amerika:** While the research came from Stanford (in America), the benefit is broader than just the US.
*   **D: Junifesithing ya Stanfort:** Stanford is where the research was done, but not where the chip is expected to be most impactful.



"
Ke mokgwa o feng o tla sebediswa ho etsa sesebediswa sa tlhahlobo?,"The correct answer is **B: Diporintara tse tlwaeleileng tsa inkjet**.

The passage explicitly states that the new diagnostic device ""can be made using ordinary 'inkjet' printers.""  While the other options are related (the cost is low, it involves chips, and it *is* a diagnostic tool), the *method* of creation is using inkjet printers.



"
"Ho latela seratswana see,ke polelo efeng eo eseng nnete ka dibopeho tse dinthong tse ding tse dipolaneteng?","The correct answer is **B: Hoba teng hwa tsona haho bolele hore khwedi ha e na mosebetsi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly contradicts the idea that the moon is geologically inactive.** It states the scarp formations suggest recent geological activity, *challenging* the belief that the moon has no geological activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho ka etsahala hore ebe diketsahalo tse di entseng di etsahetse haufinyane** - The passage *supports* this statement, saying the features appear relatively young.
* **C: E ka ba ka lebaka la ho honyamela hwa khwedi** - The passage *suggests* this as a possible cause - slow cooling leading to the scarps.
* **D: Bongata ba tsona bo ne bo sa fumanwa hodima khweli** - The passage says the scarps have been found *all over* the moon (""di fumawe hohle kgweding"").



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana see, ke kgopolo taba efeng mabapi le dibopeho tsa lefatshe e bontshang hore hona le ho foforeha hwa majwe le mobu etsahalang khweling?","The correct answer is **D: Dibopeho tsena tsa lefatshe di e ntswe haholo morao tjena**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the scarps appear to have been formed by very slow shrinking of the moon and that they seem *slightly* eroded, ""indicating that the geological events that created them were not very long ago."" This directly supports the idea that these formations are relatively recent.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Khweli entse e honyela hanyane ka hanyane** - While the passage mentions the moon shrinking, this isn't the main point about *when* the formations occurred.
*   **B: Dibopeho tsa lefatshe di bile teng ho tloha khale** - The passage *contradicts* this, saying the formations suggest recent geological activity.
*   **C: Ke dibopeho tse fokolang tsa lefatshe hodima khweli** - The passage doesn't focus on the *quantity* of formations, but their age.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke eng e sa tlo hlola e ba teng ka bongata ho fihlela qoso e ba teng?","The correct answer is **C: Ho tshohlwa hwa bopaki ba paki e boneng ka mahlo** (The contamination of eyewitness evidence).

Here's why:

The passage states that publishing the photo could compromise any potential identification by witnesses (""bopaki bofe kapa bofe ba batho ba boneng bo ka nna ba thunthetswa kaha setshwantsho sa hae se phatlaladitswe ka pharallo."").  The police have also indicated they will not comment further until a charge is made to prevent this contamination.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tlhaloso tse ding** (Other explanations) - The passage doesn't discuss a lack of other explanations.
*   **B: Phatlalatso ya dinepe** (Publication of photographs) - While the publication of the photo *is* discussed, the passage says it is the *result* of the problem, not what will be limited.
*   **D: Phatlalatso ya dingwodilweng** (Publication of documents) - This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana see, ke eng eo e seng bothata ba ha jwale ba di-sealers?","The correct answer is **A: Maemo a seng matle a lehodimo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ntle ho leqhwa le boiman, **maemo a lehodimo a mabe ka ho fetisisa** a ntse a sitisa mekutu ya pholoso."" This directly translates to ""Besides ice and seals, **the worst weather conditions** are hindering the rescue efforts."" 

The passage identifies bad weather as the current problem affecting the sealers. While the ice situation is severe, the passage frames it as something that *might* improve (""maemo a keke a ntlafala"").  The weather is the immediate obstacle.



"
"Ho tlatselletsa moo,ke eng hape e amang matsapa a pholoso?","The correct answer is **B: Maemo ba lehodimo** (Weather conditions).

**Explanation:**

The passage directly states: ""Ntle ho leqhwa le boiman, **maemo a lehodimo a mabe ka ho fetisisa** a ntse a sitisa mekutu ya pholoso."" (Besides the ice and the wind, **the worst weather conditions** are hindering the seal rescue.)

Therefore, weather conditions are clearly identified as a factor complicating the rescue efforts. The other options are not mentioned in the text."
Ke tumelo e feng eo Robett a neng a tlohele ho e netefatsa?,"The correct answer is **C: Qaleho ya bophelo (The beginning of life)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Roberts ""a lumela hore na o dumela hore bophelo bo qalehile neng, e leng potso ya bohlokwa...oo a itseng ho keke ha tshwaneleha ho hlahisa maikutlo mabapi le dintlha tse keneletseng tsa diketsahalo tse ka amehang."" This directly translates to him declining to state his belief on *when life begins*. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Boleng ba ho tshohla dinyewe (The value of fetal tissue):** The passage doesn't mention anything about fetal tissue.
*   **B: Bohlokwa ba dikahlolo tse nyallanang tsa Lekgotla le Phahameng (The importance of concurring opinions of the Court and the High Court):** He *affirmed* the importance of these, not declined to comment on them.
*   **D: Tokelo ya ho ba le lekunutu (The right to privacy):** He *affirmed* his belief in the right to privacy.



"
Ke taba e feng eo Robert a ileng a utlwa ho fosahetse hore e ka tshohlwa?,"The correct answer is **B: Diqeto tsa Roe v. Wade**.

Here's why:

The passage states Roberts ""strengthened his earlier statement that the Roe v. Wade decision was a 'perfectly lawful decision.'"" However, the context also mentions he felt it was inappropriate to offer opinions on the underlying facts of when life begins. This implies he's aware the *reasoning* behind Roe v. Wade is contentious, even if he believes the legal outcome was ""lawful.""  He's reinforcing the *decision* itself, not necessarily the arguments *for* it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho nyallana hwa likahlolo tsa Lekgotla le Phahameng la:** The passage emphasizes the importance of supporting precedents *of* the court, but doesn't suggest Roberts believes the *process* of those precedents is flawed.
*   **C: Tokelo ya ho ba le sephiri:** Roberts affirmed his belief in the right to privacy, so he doesn't view this as something to be questioned.
*   **D: Dikateng tsa nyewe:** This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
Mahlasedi a mabedi a kganya a tjhabela hokae?,"The correct answer is **A: Sepakapakeng**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mabone a mabedi a hlonngwe ho sheba lehodimo bosiu."" (""Two bright lights stared at the night sky."") This directly implies the lights are looking *up* at the sky, which is the space above.  ""Sepakapakeng"" translates to ""in the sky.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hodima teropo e kgolo** (Over the city) - While the setting is a city, the text specifies the lights are looking at the *sky*, not generally over the city.
* **C: Mabapi le sefofane sa pele** (About the first plane) - The plane is mentioned as a point of reference for the time, but the lights aren't focused *on* the plane.
* **D: Mahareng a sebaka sa bokgutso se bulehileng sa sehopotso** (In the middle of the open memorial space) - This location is mentioned, but the text doesn't connect the lights to that specific area.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, mehaho e metelele e metjha e tla ahwa neng setsheng seo?","The correct answer is **D: Kaho e ntse tswela pele** (Construction is ongoing).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kaho e a tswella bakeng sa meaho ya mafaufau e mehlano e metjha setsing sena..."" This directly translates to ""Construction is ongoing for five new buildings at this center...""  It doesn't specify a completion time, only that the building *is happening now*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mahareng a letsatsi** (Midday) - The passage doesn't mention anything about midday.
*   **B: Ka 8:46 hoseng** (At 8:46 am) - This refers to the arrival of the first plane, not construction.
*   **C: Hara bosiu** (At night) - The passage mentions seeing lights at night, but not construction happening at night.



"
Ke ditaba dife tse hlahisang hore “The Seven Sisters” ke mahaha?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho fapana ha metjheso le serame**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that infrared images show **changes in temperature from day to night** that suggest caves. It explains that ""The Seven Sisters"" cool down more during the day and warm up at night, which is the behavior expected of caves. This temperature difference is the key piece of evidence pointing to their nature as caves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bophara ba menyako ya mahaha:** While the width is mentioned, it's a descriptive detail, not the *reason* scientists suspect they are caves.
*   **C: Dipatlisiso tsa majwe le mobu le sebopeho sa teng:** The text doesn't mention any analysis of rocks, soil, or the geological structure.
*   **D: Dinepe tsa mahaha hodima lefatshe:** This isn’t discussed in the text.



"
Boitshwaro ba motjheso wa Seven Sisters bo fumanwa jwang?,"The correct answer is **A: Ditshwantsho see lekanyang tempereitjhara ya ntho e itseng** (Infrared images that measure the temperature of something).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""**Ditshwantsho tsa infrared di bontsha hore diphetoho tsa motjheso ho tloha motshehare ho ya bosiung...**"" (Infrared images show that temperature changes from day to night...). This directly indicates how the temperature behavior of the Seven Sisters was discovered – through infrared imaging.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Masoba a maholo fatshe** (Large underground cavities) - While the passage suggests it *might* be cavities, this is a conclusion *based on* the temperature behavior, not *how* the behavior was discovered.
*   **C: Bophara ba mahaha** (Width of volcanoes) - The width is a characteristic *of* the Seven Sisters, but not how their temperature behavior was found.
*   **D: Dipatlisiso ka mahaha hodima lefatshe** (Research on volcanoes on Earth) - This is a comparison used by the USGS scientist to understand the Seven Sisters, not the method of discovery.

"Ho latela seratswana, ke ditaba difeng tseo e leng mafosisa ka mmelaellwa?","The correct answer is **B: O belaellwa a sebedisitse seqhomane**.

Here's why:

* The text states the man is suspected of *detonating the explosives* (""o ile a qhomisitseng bomo""). This directly means he's believed to have used explosives.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: O ile a sebedisa koloi nakong ya tlhaselo** - While a vehicle was involved, the text doesn't say he *used* it in the attack, only that he drove two or three vehicles *into* the crowd.
* **C: Ba ikarabellang ba tseba hore na ke wa mohlobo o feng** - The text explicitly states his name is unknown and only that he's a member of the Uyghur ethnic group. Knowing his ethnicity isn't the same as knowing his identity.
* **D: O ile a lemala** - The text says he was detained (""o ile a tshwarwa"") but doesn't state he has been convicted of a crime.



"
Ke ditaba difeng tseo ba boholong ba ileng ba di tiisa tse amanang le tlhaselo?,"The correct answer is **A: Boitsebiso ba batho ba entseng tlolo ya molao le babelaellwa** (Information about the perpetrators and suspects).

Here's why:

* The passage states a suspect was arrested *after* evidence linked him to the bombing. It also mentions authorities know he's part of the Uyghur ethnic group. This is all information relating to who committed the crime (perpetrators) and who is suspected (suspects).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mohlobo wa mmelaellwa** (Friend of the suspect) - The passage doesn't mention any friends.
* **C: Sepheo sa tlhaselo** (Motive of the attack) - The passage does *not* state why the attack happened.
* **D: Lebitso le fane ya mmelaellwa** (Name and surname of the suspect) - The passage specifically states his name is *not* yet known.



"
Ke dihlopha difeng tse tla bapala papaling e tla tshwarelwa Ellis Park?,"The correct answer is **C: Afrika Borwa le Australia**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Papadi ya bofelo ya letoto e tla ba Ellis Park mane Johannesburg bekeng e tlang, moo di-Springbok di tla bapala kgahlanong le Australia."" 

*   ""Di-Springbok"" is the nickname for the South African national rugby team.
*   Therefore, the final match will be between South Africa (Springboks) and Australia.



"
Sehlopha sa Springboks se tla bapala papadi ya sona e hlahlamang hokae?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Papadi ya bofelo ya letoto e tla ba Ellis Park mane Johannesburg bekeng e tlang, moo di-Springbok di tla bapala kgahlanong le Australia.""  This directly states the final match will be at Ellis Park in Johannesburg.



"
Ke mathata a feng ao sepalangwang sa ho ya sepakapakeng se ileng sa kopana le ona nakong ya letsholo?,"The correct answer is **B: Ho boloka sesebediswa sa gyroscope** (Maintaining the gyroscope instrument).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states ""ho sa natswe tahlehelo ya gyroscope pejana leetong la seteisheneng sa sepakapaka"" which translates to ""failure of the gyroscope was noticed early in the spacewalk"".  The rest of the passage describes the steps taken to *address* that gyroscope failure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho boloka sebaka se lekaneng hole le difehli** (Maintaining sufficient distance from debris) - While space debris is a concern in spacewalks, it's not the primary problem mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Ho tlosa sefofane** (Removing the aircraft) - This doesn't make sense in the context of a spacewalk.
*   **D: Ho fumana boikutlo bo tsitsitseng hape** (Regaining stable attitude) - This was a *result* of the gyroscope failure and the subsequent actions, not the initial problem.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, sepheo sa sepalangwang sa sepakapakeng e ne e le sefe?","The correct answer is **A: Ho fumana sesebediswa sa gyroscope se lahlehileng** (To find the lost gyroscope instrument).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states ""ho sa natswe tahlehelo ya gyroscope pejana leetong la seteisheneng sa sepakapaka"" (to recover the lost gyroscope during the spacewalk). The entire spacewalk was undertaken because of this missing gyroscope.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ho atamela katoloso ya difehli** (To address the misalignment of panels) - While attitude adjustment thrusters were used, the *reason* for the spacewalk wasn't to fix panels.
*   **C: Ho phethela tshebetso ya sepakapakeng e kantle ho sepalangwang** (To complete routine spacewalk operations) - The spacewalk wasn't routine; it was specifically to find a missing part.
*   **D: Ho fofisa difofane** (To test spacecraft) - The text mentions Russian ground control testing spacecraft, but this wasn’t the spacewalk’s *purpose*."
Ke polelo efe ho tse latelang eo e seng nnete ka nyewe ee?,"The correct answer is **A: E ne e sekasekwa sebakeng seo e leng ntlo-kgolo ya AOL**.

Here's why:

The passage states Virginia pursued the lawsuit *because* it was the home of AOL. It doesn't say the spam operation *was located* in Virginia (at AOL headquarters). It just means Virginia had jurisdiction because AOL, the company related to the fees, was based there.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

*   **B: Molato o ile wa fumanwa** - The passage clearly states a judgment was obtained.
*   **C: Molao o thibelang phetiso ya melaetsa ya lefofo ka marang-rang a email** - The passage mentions a law passed in 2003 to curb unwanted email (spam).
*   **D: AOL ene e qoswa** - The passage says AOL was the target of the fees, implying they were the company being accused of enabling the spam.



"
Ke polelo efe e hlalosang ka nepo nyewe yee?,"The correct answer is **A: AOL e ile ya qoswa ka phano ya thepa ntle le tumellano** (AOL was accused of sending goods without agreement).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nyewe e ile ya tjhotjhiswa mane Virginia hobane ke lehae la mofani wa inthaneteng ya eteletseng pele AOL, e leng khampani e rerileng ditefiso tsena."" This translates to ""The lawsuit was filed in Virginia because it's the home of internet pioneer AOL, the company responsible for these fees.""  This indicates AOL is being accused of *something* related to the fees/spam.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nyewe ene kenyeletsa ditsi tse ka sehloohong tsa marang-rang** (This lawsuit involves key figures of the internet) - The passage doesn't mention key figures, only AOL as a company.
* **C: Nyewe e ile ya sekasekwa ka selemo sa 2003** (The lawsuit was filed in 2003) - The passage states the law used in the lawsuit was *passed* in 2003, not that the lawsuit itself was filed then.
* **D: AOL e ile ya susumemetsa ho sekasekwa hwa nyewe** (AOL encouraged the filing of the lawsuit) - This is the opposite of what the passage implies; AOL is the target of the lawsuit.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke sehlopha sefe seo Vidal a qalileng ho se bapalla dihleng tse tharo tse fitileng?","The correct answer is **A: Sevilla**.

The text states: ""Vidal ya dilemo tse 28 o kenetse sehlopha sa Barça dihleng tse tharo tse fetileng, ho tswa Sevilla."" This translates to ""Vidal, aged 28, joined the Barça team three seasons ago, coming from Sevilla.""

Therefore, Vidal started playing for Sevilla three seasons ago."
Vidal o bapetse dipapadi tse kae tsa Barca?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The text states: ""Haesale a fallela motsemoholong wa Catalan, Vidal o bapetse dipapadi tse 49 bakeng sa tlelapa."" (Since arriving in Catalonia, Vidal has played 49 games for the team.)
"
Sehlopha se seng e ne e le sefe papading eo?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

The passage states the papadi (match) was *against* Bolonia. Therefore, Bolonia was the opposing team in the match."
Hobaneng Jargue a ne a dula hoteleng?,"The correct answer is **A: O ne a na le boikwetliso** (He was undergoing training).

The passage states ""Jarque o ne a ikwetlisa boikwetlisong ba pele ho sehla mane Coverciano..."" which directly translates to ""Jarque was undergoing training at the Coverciano training center...""  The fact he was staying at the hotel was *because* of the training.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: O ile a ba le kopano ya pele ya sehla se qala** (He had the first meeting of the season) - The text doesn't mention a meeting.
* **C: O ne a na le papadi ka Sontaha** (He had a match on Sunday) - The match is mentioned, but it's not the *reason* he was at the hotel.
* **D: O ne a ikwetlisa le sehlopha sa Bolonia** (He was training with the Bologna team) - He's playing *against* Bologna, not training with them.



"
Hobaneng mokhatlo wa mahlale a a tsa tlhaho wa Jakarta o sa ka wa etsa temoso?,"The correct answer is **D: E ne e sa fihlele liphelo tse hlokahalang tsa ho reketla**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...according to the Jakarta geophysics agency, a tsunami warning will not be issued because the earthquake did not reach the threshold of 6.5 magnitude.""  This means the earthquake wasn't strong enough to warrant a tsunami warning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho ne ho se na kotsi ya tsunami:** While true *as a result* of the magnitude, the agency's decision wasn't based on knowing there was no danger, but on the measurement of the earthquake itself.
* **B: Ho qoba pherekano ya baahi:** The passage states people are *already* panicking and evacuating, so avoiding panic isn't the reason for not issuing a warning.
* **C: Ho qoba tahlehelo ya khwebo ya baahi:**  The agency's primary concern is safety, not economic impact.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho reketla ho bakile eng?","The correct answer is **B: Kotsi ya tsunami**.

Here's why:

The passage states a tsunami warning *was* issued, and even though it was later retracted based on the earthquake's magnitude, the *fear of a tsunami* is what caused people to panic and evacuate. The earthquake itself triggered the initial concern about a tsunami.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baahi ba ferekaneng** - While the population *experienced* fear, the earthquake didn't cause the fear directly, but rather the possibility of a tsunami.
*   **C: Temoso e fitisitsweng** - The warning contributed to the fear, but it wasn't the primary cause. The underlying fear was of the tsunami itself.
*   **D: Bolelele ba 6.5 sekaleng ba ho reketla** - The magnitude was the reason the warning was *cancelled*, not what caused the initial panic.



"
Ke ntho efe ho tse latelang e susumetsang mesebetsi ya Letsatsi le dinaledi tse ling?,"The correct answer is **C: Ho potoloho le le khanya ya dintho tse sebakeng**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that the operation of all stars in a system is determined by their **light** and **rotation**.  These two factors are used *together* to calculate the Rossby number, which then relates to plasma flow and magnetic activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Khanya ya dintho tse sebakeng le phallo ya plasma:** While light is mentioned, plasma flow is a *result* of the Rossby number (linked to light and rotation), not a fundamental driver.
*   **B: Nomoro e se nang tekanyo,ho potoloha le phetoho ho matla a khohedi:** The passage doesn't mention ""nomoro e se nang tekanyo"" or changes in gravitational power as driving factors.
*   **D: khanya ya dintho tse sebakeng,nomoro e se nang tekanyo le ho potoloha:** It includes the incorrect ""nomoro e se nang tekanyo"".



"
Nomoro e se nang tekanyo ya naledi e fumanwa jwang?,"The correct answer is **A: Khanya ya dintho tse sebakeng le ho potoloha**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a star's activity is determined by its **luminosity (khanya)** and **rotation (ho potoloha)**. These two factors are used together to calculate the Rossby number, which is linked to plasma flow. Therefore, the luminosity and rotation are the fundamental measurements used.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Phallo e kae ya plasma** - While plasma flow *is* related to the Rossby number, it's a *result* of the luminosity and rotation, not a direct measurement used to find the number itself.
* **C: Boemo ba ho kena tshebetsong** - This is too broad and not specifically mentioned in the text.
* **D: Ditekanyetso tsa phetoho ho matla a khohedi** - This isn't mentioned in the text as being used to determine a star's number.



"
"Lekgolong, ke karolo e kae ya batho e tshehetsang mohato wa hore naha ya Austrilia e fetohe rephaboliki hang-hang?","The correct answer is **B: Diperesente tse 29**.

The text states: ""diphesente tse 29 tsa batho ba botsitsweng ba dumela hore Australia e tlameha ho ba riphaboliki kapele ka moo ho ka kgonehang..."" This directly answers the question."
"Ho ya ka Julie Gillard, Austrilia e lokela ho ba rephaboliki?","The correct answer is **B: Kamora puso ya Mofumahadi Elizabeth wa bobedi**.

The text states: ""Tonakgolo ya mokobobo Julia Gillard o boletse nakong ya boiketo ba dikgetho tsa bofederale tsa 2010 hore o dumela hore Australia e tlameha ho ba riphaboliki qetellong ya botlotlehi ba Mofumahadi Elizabeth II."" This translates to ""Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.""
"
Ke mokhatlo o feng o tlasa dipatlisiso tsa molao?,"The correct answer is **C: Mokhatlo wa Planned Parenthood**.

The passage explicitly states that the Komen Foundation created a new policy refusing funding to organizations under legal investigations, and that this impacted Planned Parenthood due to increasing scrutiny regarding how Planned Parenthood used and reported its funds.
"
Cliff Stears ke mookamedi ya komiti efe?,"The correct answer is **D: Komitjana ya leihlo le nchocho le lipatlisiso**.

The text states: ""...e tlasa sekgurumetso sa Komiti ya Eneji le Kgwebo ya Ntlo ya Baemedi ya Palamente.""  and ""...tsamaiswang ke Moemedi Palamenteng Cliff Stearns, jwalo ka modulasetulo wa Bodisa le Komiti e Nyane ya Dipatlisiso..."".  This directly translates to Cliff Stearns being the chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ha ho wa etsahalang ka mosadi wa Switzerland?","The correct answer is **A: Thepa ya hae e neng e utswitswe e fumanwe**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""re tshwere batho ba bahlano ba betileng mosadi wa moSwiss mme ra fumana selefounu ya hae le laptop"" - which translates to ""we arrested five people who robbed the Swiss woman and recovered her phone and laptop.""  This indicates her belongings were stolen and *recovered*, not that she was harmed in a more severe way.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: O bolailwe** - The text does not mention she was killed.
*   **C: O ile a hlekefetswa ka motabo ke batho ba 5** - While she was robbed by 5 people, the text doesn't state it was done with cruelty.
*   **D: Fono ya hae le lepothopo ya hae di ile tsa utswa** - This is *what happened* to her belongings, but the question asks what *happened to the woman*. The recovery of the items is the relevant outcome related to her.



"
Ke khampani efe e abetsweng khau ya Taiwan Sustainable Award ka selemo sa 2007?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The text explicitly states: ""kamora hore ASUS e abelwe Kgau ya Tswelletso ya Taiwan ya 2007 (2007 Taiwan Sustainable Award) ka Executive Yuan ya Riphaboliki ya China.""  This directly indicates ASUS was awarded the prize.
"
ASUS Eee PC ke mofuta ofeng wa komporo?,"The correct answer is **B: Lepothopo**.

The text explicitly states ""mmaraka wa moreki khomputeng ya """"laptop"""" ya hae"" which translates to ""the consumer market for its """"laptop"""" computer.""  ""Laptop"" translates to ""lepothopo"" in Setswana.

Therefore, the ASUS Eee PC is a laptop."
Ke mang ya neng a na le boikarabelo thepeng e nyametseng ya poso?,"The correct answer is **C: Moshemane**.

The passage explicitly states: ""moshanyana o ne a patile ditokomane tse fetang tse 600 tsa poso..."" which translates to ""a boy had falsified more than 600 postal documents...""  This clearly identifies the boy as the one responsible for the postal theft.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang ya kopileng tshwarelo mabapi le ditokomane tse nyametseng?","The correct answer is **D: Poso ya Obanazawa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...poso e phatlaladitse kopo ya tshwarelo ya yona ho baahi le ho masedinyana..."" which translates to ""...the post office issued its apology to residents and families..."" 

Therefore, it is the **Post Office of Obanazawa** that apologized for the missing documents. While the boy *caused* the problem, the apology came *from* the post office.



"
Del Patro o ile a hloka ho bua bothata ba hae ba lehetla neng?,"The correct answer is **C: Mokgahlelong wa bobedi** (In the second set).

Here's why:

The text states ""Potro o fumane kalafo lehetleng la hae ka nako ena empa a kgona ho kgutlela papading."" which translates to ""Del Potro received medical attention for his leg at this time but was able to return to the court.""  This happened *during* the second set tiebreak, after reaching 6-6.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mokgahlelong wa pele** (In the first set) - The text doesn't mention any leg issues in the first set.
*   **B: Pele ho kgefutso ya kamora hore dintlha di lekane lekgetlo la pele** (Before the deuce after the points were tied for the first time) - This is too early; the injury happened later in the second tiebreak.
*   **D: Kamora kgefutso ya ha dintlha di lekane lekgetlo la boraro** (After the deuce when the points were tied for the third time) - The text only specifies the injury happened *during* the second set tiebreak, not a specific deuce.



"
Sephetho sa dintlha tse neng di lekana lekgetlo la pele ho kgefutso ke sefe?,"The correct answer is **A: Murray o ile a hlolwa lekgetlong la pele** (Murray lost the first set).

Here's why:

The passage states Murray lost the first set *in a tie-break* after both players held serve.  This means the set reached 6-6 and Murray lost the tie-break.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Del Potro o ile a hlolwa kamora temalo ya hae** - The passage doesn't state Del Potro lost after a break point.
* **C: E hapilwe ke Murray mokgahlelong wa bobedi** - The passage only discusses the first set.
* **D: E hapilwe ke Del Potro mokgahlelong wa bobedi** - Again, the passage only discusses the first set.



"
"Jwalo kaha ho boletswe, ke mang ya ileng a kopana le mokudi ka kotloloho?","The correct answer is **B: Bana**.

The passage states: ""Kajeno, re ithutile hore bana ba bang ba boholo ba ho kena sekolo ba tsebahaditswe ba bile le kopano le mokudi."" This directly indicates that children who were about to enter school had a meeting with the shooter."
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ha mmusisi a bua le baahi ba Texas ha a ka a fana ka tiisetso efe?","The correct answer is **A: Tsamaiso e ntse e sebetsa hantle**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dula o tshepile hore sisitimi ya rona e sebetsa hantle ka moo e lokelang.""  This directly translates to ""Continue to trust that our system is working as it should,"" which means the governor was assuring the people that the system is functioning correctly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ho na le dintho tse ntseng di etswa ho sireletsa setjhaba** - While the passage *implies* action is being taken (""mehato ya ho sireletsa polokeho ya setjhaba""), the governor's direct assurance is about the *functioning* of the system, not ongoing actions.
* **C: Ba loketse ho kopana le phephetso** -  The governor acknowledges the challenge (""phephetso e tliswang ke boemo bona"") and Texas's ability to handle it, but doesn't specifically assure the citizens of *their* readiness.
* **D: Taba eo ha e boima haholo** - The passage states ""Boemo bona bo mahlonoko haholo"" (""This situation is very painful""), meaning the governor acknowledges the severity of the situation, not that it's minor.



"
Baithuti ba babedi ba mehleng ba sekolo sa UW ba entse mohlodi ofe wa lenaneo la ditaba tsa boswasi?,"The correct answer is **D: The Onion**.

The passage explicitly states that Heck and Johnson ""recognized the potential for satire—even news satire—as UW undergraduates in 1988"" and then goes on to describe *The Onion* as a major force in news satire with a large readership and various platforms. The passage highlights *The Onion* as the embodiment of that potential they recognized.

The other options are mentioned in the text but are not the organization founded by the two students:

*   **A: The Colbert Report** - Mentioned as a program the writers later worked on.
*   **B: The Electoral College** - Referenced in a satirical story by *The Onion*.
*   **C: The Daily Show** - Mentioned as a program the writers later worked on.



"
"Ho latela seratswana see, ke eng e sa kenyeletswang ka hara ditaba tsa boswaswi tsa The Onion?","The correct answer is **B: Filimi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly lists the following as part of The Onion's satirical news empire:

*   **Kgatiso ya dingolwa** (Print publication)
*   **Webosaete** (Website)
*   **dipapatso tsa botho** (Personal appearances)
*   **netweke ya ditaba ya dihoreng tse 24** (24-hour news network)
*   **di-podcast** (Podcasts)
*   **atlelase ya lefatshe e bitswang Our Dumb World** (Atlas/map of the world)

It does *not* mention films or movies. Therefore, film is the only option not included in The Onion’s satirical output as described in the text."
Ho ya ka seratswana ke eng e neng e lebelwa ke mapolesa?,"The correct answer is **C: Menyako ya Downing Street**.

Here's why:

The text states the protest began ""facing the police-guarded entrance to Downing Street"". This means the police were guarding the entrance to Downing Street, making it the target the police were focused on and potentially trying to protect.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Trafalgar Square:** The protesters *passed through* Trafalgar Square, but it wasn't what was being guarded.
*   **B: Seboka sa na ya Selemo:** The protest *ended up* near the Conservative Party conference, but it wasn't the initial focus of the police.
*   **D: Dikamore tsa hotele ea Grand Connaught:** This is where the conference was held, but not where the police were initially positioned or what they were guarding.



"
Ke nako efe eo mapolesa a kopileng baipelaetsi ho sutha e le ho qoba phallo e phahameng ya sephethephethe?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka 11:20**.

The text states: ""Ka 11:20, mapolesa a kopile baipelaetsi ho tjhetjhela peifementeng, ba bolela hore ba lokela ho lekalekanya tokelo ya ho ipelaetsa le thibello ya sephethephethe."" This directly translates to ""At 11:20, police asked protesters to move to the pavement, stating that they needed to balance the right to protest with the restriction of traffic.""
"
Ke eng eo e leng nnete ka dipatlisiso tse entsweng ke Dr.Ehud Ur?,"The correct answer is **B: Ditweba tse ding tse neng di na le lefu la tswekere ha di sa na lona**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jwale re na le ditadi tse dikgwedi tse 4 tse se nang lefu la tswekere tse neng di na le lefu la tswekere,"". This directly translates to ""Now we have four cases that are diabetes-free that had diabetes.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Diphetho di ka ba molemo ho bakudi ba lefu la tswekere la Mofuta wa 1** - Dr. Ur specifically states this research doesn't relate to Type 1 diabetes patients.
*   **C: O na le tshepo ya hore tse fumanweng boithutong di ka lebisa phekong** - While he acknowledges the research, he expresses caution and isn't definitively hopeful about a cure.
*   **D: Tse ding tsa ditweba tse neng di sena lefu la tswekere dina le lefu la tswekere** - The passage clearly states the opposite – some cases are *now* diabetes-free.



"
"Ho latela seratswana see, Dr. Ur o belaela eng?","The correct answer is **B: Haeba pheko e ka khoneha**.

Here's why:

The passage states Dr. Ur ""is skeptical about whether diabetes can be cured."" This directly reflects a doubt about the possibility of a cure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Haeba diphetho e le tse dumellanang le bakudi ba lefu la tswekere la Mofuta wa 1** - He specifically states the findings don't relate to Type 1 diabetes.
*   **C: Maikutlo a ditsebi tse ding malebana le pheko** - While he's one of ""the experts,"" the passage focuses on *his* skepticism, not disagreement with others' opinions.
*   **D: Haeba ditweba tse se nang lefu la tsaekere di tl dula di le jwalo** - The passage does not discuss whether non-diabetic individuals will remain that way.



"
Ke polelo efe e sa hlaloseng ka nepo ho swahlamana hwa sefofane sa CG4684?,"The correct answer is **C: Sefofane se lekile ho tsorama makgetlo a mararo pele se swahlamana.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states the plane was preparing for its *second* takeoff attempt when it disappeared. It didn't attempt three takeoffs.
*   **A** is supported by the text: ""Letsholo la ho batla le sitisitswe ke maemo a mabe a lehodimo a bakileng hore sefofane se nyahlatse ho tsorama.""
*   **B** is supported by the text: ""Sebaka sa ho swahlamana se fumanwe kajeno mme ha se fihlellehe..."" and the need for police to walk to the site.
*   **D** is supported by the text: ""Letsholo la ho batla le sitisitswe ke maemo a mabe a lehodimo a bakileng hore sefofane se nyahlatse ho tsorama."" (suggests weather played a role).

Therefore, only option C is not accurately reflected in the given information."
Ke eng se bakileng ho re sefofane sa CG4684 se khethe ho se tsorame?,"The correct answer is **D: Maemo a lehodimo a ne a se matle**.

The text explicitly states: ""Letsholo la ho batla le sitisitswe ke maemo a mabe a lehodimo a bakileng hore sefofane se nyahlatse ho tsorama."" (The search was hampered by bad weather causing the plane to crash during takeoff).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sebaka sa ho tsorama se ne se sa fihlelehe:** While the landing site was inaccessible *after* the crash, this wasn't the reason the plane didn't take off.
*   **B: Ho ne ho ena le difofane tse mmalwa kapela CG4684:** The text doesn't mention other planes.
*   **C: Sefofane se ile sa lebiswa sebakeng sa Kokoda:** The plane was *going* to Kokoda, but this doesn't explain why it crashed during takeoff.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke polelo efe ho tse latelang eo eleng nnete ka boiphihlelo ba Francizek Kowal?","The correct answer is **B: O qeteletse a sa tswa dikotsi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""...ke bone dipono tsa sehloho tsa masisapelo, ha batho ba leka ho pshatla difenstere hore ba tswe."" This means he *saw* people trying to escape, but it doesn't say he personally escaped or was harmed.
*   Later the passage says, ""E nngwe ya dikgalase ya qetella e pshatlehile, mme ba qala ho tswa ka fenstere,"" meaning *others* escaped, not necessarily Franciszek.
*   The passage does *not* say he broke a window (A), used a chair (C), or was injured (D).

The passage implies he witnessed a dangerous situation but was ultimately okay. Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer.



"
Hobaneng ho se bobebe ho lepa tshenyo ya sefefo sa Danielle?,"The correct answer is **C: Sefefo se hole le lebopo lewatle** (The storm is far from land).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hobane sefefo sena se sa le hole le ho fihla naheng, ho sa le thata ho lekanya kgonahalo ya ditlamorao tsa sona naheng ya United States kapa Caribbean."" This directly translates to ""Because this storm is still far from land, it is still difficult to estimate the potential impacts on the United States or the Caribbean.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sefefo se lepuwa hore e tla ba lehodiotswana le leholo** (The storm is predicted to be small and large) - The passage doesn't mention the storm's size, only its current strength and potential to strengthen.
*   **B: Boramahlale ha ba na bonnete ka taba ea meya e tsitseng ya sefefo** (Scientists are unsure about the speed of the storm) - The passage states the storm currently has sustained winds of over 40 mph and predicts it will strengthen. There's no uncertainty mentioned about the *current* speed.
*   **D: Sefefo se fumaneha hole le sebaka sa Miami** (The storm is located far from Miami) - While true (3,000 miles from Miami), this isn't the *reason* it's hard to predict the impact. It's the general distance from *any* landmass that makes prediction difficult.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke polelo efe ho tse latelang eo e seng nnete ka lehodiotswana Danielle?","The correct answer is **D: Le haufi le lebopo la lewatle**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""se bohle bo hakanyetswang ho dimmaele tse 3,000 ho tloha Miami, Florida"" (it's currently estimated to be 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida).  3,000 miles is *not* close to the coastline.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: Tshenyo ya lona sebakeng sa Caribbean ha e tsebahale** (Damage in the Caribbean is unknown) - The passage states: ""Hobane sefefo sena se sa le hole le ho fihla naheng, ho sa le thata ho lekanya kgonahalo ya ditlamorao tsa sona naheng ya United States kapa Caribbean""
*   **B: Le ile la qala Lewatleng la Antlantic** (It started in the Atlantic Ocean) - The passage states: ""Sefefo sena se thomehile Lewatleng la Atlelanthiki ka botjhabela"" (This storm originated in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean).
*   **C: Le ka qetella le fetohile lehodiotswana** (It could eventually become a hurricane) - The passage states: ""Borasaense ba National Hurricane Center ba lepile hore Danielle e tla matlafala ho fihlela boemo ba sefefo sa hurricane ka Laboraro"" (National Hurricane Center scientists predict Danielle will strengthen to hurricane status by Tuesday)."
"Ho latela seratswana, ho nahanwa hore ho lokela ho etsahale eng ka lefu pele e ka ba sewa se amang lefatshe ka kakaretso?","The correct answer is **B: Matshwao a bokudi a lokela a dule ele a bobebe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Diphuputso ts ding di hlahisitse hore lefu lena le tlameha ho se be le kotsi e kgolo pele le ka baka sewa sa lefatshe lohle, a bolela jwalo. Ho na le ngongoreho ya hore bakudi ba ka nna ba tswela pele ho tshwaetsa batho ba bang ka ho phetha mesebetsi ya bona ya letsatsi le letsatsi haeba matshwao a ho kula a mokgohlane a dula a le bobebe.""

This translates to: ""Other studies have shown that this disease must not be very dangerous before it can cause a global pandemic, he says. There is a possibility that carriers can continue to infect others by performing their daily activities if the symptoms of bird flu remain mild.""

Therefore, the passage suggests the disease needs to remain mild (symptoms remain mild) to avoid becoming a pandemic.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Le tlameha le se ke la bolaya haholo** - While lethality is a factor in a pandemic, the passage specifically focuses on symptom severity and continued transmission *despite* mild symptoms.
*   **C: Batho ba bangata ba lokela ho tshwaetswa** - The passage doesn't suggest that more people *need* to be infected.
*   **D: Bana ba lokela ho ba le matshwao a bokudi** - The passage focuses on carriers in general, not specifically children."
"Ho latela seratswana, sefefo se ne se le hole hakae le sebaka sa Fuji?","The correct answer is **C: Dikhilomethara tse 70**.

The passage states the typhoon was ""dikhilomitara tse mashome a supileng thoko"" (70 kilometers) from Fujian province."
Ke mang ya dumedisitseng George W. Bush hang ha a fihla Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng le Lee Hsien Loong**.

Here's why:

The text states that George W. Bush was ""greeted by Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng and met with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong"". This means both individuals welcomed and engaged with him upon his arrival.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tona-kgolo (Prime Minister)** - While he *met* with the Prime Minister, he was first greeted by the Deputy Prime Minister as well.
*   **B: Letshwele (Secretary)** - The text doesn't mention a secretary greeting him.
*   **D: Motlatsi wa Tona-kgolo (Deputy Prime Minister)** - Only one person, not two, greeted him."
Moperesidente o buile neng ka katoloso ya tsa khwebisano Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka mora ho hlolwa ke dikgetho tsa mahareng tsa nako ya puso**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kamora beke ya ditahlehelo dikgethong tsa mahareng a sehla, Bush o jwetsitse bamamedi mabapi le katoloso ya kgwebo Asia."" This directly translates to ""After a week of losses in the midterm elections, Bush addressed the media about the expansion of Asian trade.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hang ha a fihla Singapore** - While he arrived in Singapore, the text doesn't say he spoke about trade expansion *upon arrival*.
*   **B: A na le Won Kan Seng** - He discussed trade *with* Wong Kan Seng, but didn't make a broader statement to the media during that meeting.
*   **D: Beke eo kaofela ya leeto la hae Asia** - The text specifies he spoke *after* the election results, not throughout the entire trip."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke ntho efe ho tse latelang eo e leng sepheo se akaretsang sa mmuso?","The correct answer is **C: Ho fumana dikariki tse ding tse 1,300**.

Here's why:

The passage states the additional 300 ""makeratjhe a tlatsetso"" (additional trainees) will bring the *total* to 1,300 trainees being used to address unemployment. This means the overall goal of the government is to have 1,300 trainees working.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage talks about *supporting* trainees with funding, not the act of selecting trainees before the end of February.
*   **B:** Getting 300 trainees is *part* of the plan, but not the ultimate goal.
*   **D:** The passage doesn’t suggest there’s an oversupply of trainees, but rather focuses on increasing the number to address unemployment.



"
Mmuso o ile wa phatlalatsa eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba rera ho tshetsa ka ditjhelete morero wa dikariki tse ding tse 300**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""A mang a tlatsetso a 300 a tla tlisa kakaretso ho makaretjhe a 1,300 a tla fumanwa ho imolla matshweletshwele."" This means the government is planning to fund *another* 300 farms (dikariki), bringing the total to 1,300 to address a problem (matshweletshwele - hardship/struggle).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ba ikemiseditse ho imolla bothata ba dikariki** - While they are trying to *address* a problem, the passage doesn't say they are committed to *solving* the issue of the farms themselves, but rather the hardship.
*   **C: Ba rera ho tshehetsa ka ditjhelete morero wa dikariki tse ding tse 1,300** - The passage says the total will *reach* 1,300, not that they are funding 1,300 new ones.
*   **D: Bothata ba tshubuhlellano bo tla rarolwa ka Thlakubele** - The passage mentions February (Hlakubele) as when the initial support was given, not when the problem will be solved.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke taba efe e tsebahalang?","The correct answer is **C: Tlhaselo e lebeletswe**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states: ""Ha ho bohlale ho bolela hore ho na le tlhaselo e lebeletsweng haufinyane."" This translates to ""It is wise to say there is an impending attack.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Boemo ba tshoso bo fokotsehile (The threat level has been reduced)** - While the passage mentions the threat level being *reduced* to painful, it doesn't mean it's gone.
*   **B: Ha ho sa na tshoso (There is no threat)** - The passage directly contradicts this by mentioning an impending attack.
*   **D: Mautlowela a netefaditse hore tlhaselo e tla ba e kotsi (Authorities have confirmed the attack will be dangerous)** - The passage doesn’t mention authorities or the danger level of the attack, just that one is expected.



"
Ke polelo efe mabapi le boipelaetso eo e seng nnete?,"The correct answer is **A: Khomeshene ya moperesidente ebile karabo ho boipelaetso** (The presidential commission was a response to the appeal).

Here's why:

The text states the commission *responded to* the appeal, meaning it was a result *of* the appeal, not the appeal responding to it. It was formed *as part of* the agreement to move towards new elections due to the crisis caused by the appeal. 

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **B: Dikgetho tse neng li fitilwe ke nako di ile tsa baka boipelaetso** (Delayed elections caused the appeal) - This is true. The appeal stemmed from the failure to hold elections since 2011.
*   **C: Boipelaetso bo ne bo batla hore CEP wa pele a itokolle mosebetsing** (The appeal wanted the previous CEP to resign) - This is true. The presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the agreement.
*   **D: Ka dinako tse ding boipelaetso bone bo le kotsi** (At times the appeal was dangerous) - This is true. The text says the appeal was once associated with violent actions (""diketso tsa dikgoka"").



"
Ke mang ya ileng a kgothaletsa hore CEP ya ho qetela a itokolle?,"The correct answer is **C: Khomeshene ya moperesidente** (The Presidential Commission).

The text states: ""Kgweding e fetileng khomishene ya bopresidente e kgothaleditse ho itokolla mosebetsing ha CEP ya pejana..."" which translates to ""Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Martelly** - The text says Martelly *appointed* the CEP members, not that he recommended their resignation.
*   **B: Baipelaetsi** (Protesters) - While the protests created the pressure, the commission made the *recommendation*.
*   **D: Ditho tsa CEP di e kgothaleditse ka botsona** (The CEP members recommended it themselves) - The text doesn't mention this. It states the commission recommended it.



"
"Holatela seratswana,ke eng se sa tshehetswang ke dipapali tsa Gymnastics tsa Amerika ka morao hore Nassar a hlekefetse dibapadi?","The correct answer is **A: Ho amuhuwa setifikeite** (Accepting a certification).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Re dumellana le polelo ya USOC hore ditabatabelo tsa baatlelete ba rona le ditlelapa, le papadi ya bona, hore di ka sebeletswa ka tsela e ntlafetseng ke ho hatela pele ka phetoho e amohelehang kahare ho mokgatlo wa rona, **ho fapana le ho amohuwa setifikeiti.**"" (We agree with the USOC statement that the well-being of our athletes and their families, and the sport, can be better served by driving meaningful change within our organization, **rather than accepting a certification**).

The passage explicitly says that USA Gymnastics *does not* believe accepting a certification is the right approach. They favor internal change instead.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ho etsa tikoloho e matlafetseng** (Creating a stronger environment) - The passage states they *support* this.
*   **C: Diphetoho tse hlokahalang ka hare ho mokgatlo** (Necessary changes within the organization) - They *support* this.
*   **D: Dipatlisiso tse ikemetseng** (Independent investigations) - They *support* this.



"
"Holatela seratswana, ke sefe sepheo sa mantlha sa dibapadi tsa Gymnastics tsa Amerika le komiti ya diolimpiki ya Amerika?","The correct answer is **D: Ho kgothaletsa tikoloho e bolokehileng bakeng sa dibapadi** (To promote a safe environment for gymnasts).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that both USA Gymnastics and the USOC share a goal of ""making gymnastics, and all sports, as safe as possible so that athletes may pursue their dreams in a safe, supportive and empowering environment."" This is the overarching and main goal discussed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lesedi ditabeng tsa tlhekefetso e bakilweng ke Larry Nassair** (Shedding light on the abuse caused by Larry Nassar) - While investigating Nassar's abuse is *part* of the effort, it's a means to the end of creating a safer environment, not the primary goal itself.
*   **B: Ho latela ho amuhuwa ha setifikeiti** (Following up on certification) - The passage specifically says USA Gymnastics prefers internal change *over* certification.
*   **C: Ho latela dipatlisiso tse ikemetseng** (Following up on independent investigations) -  Like with Nassar, investigations are tools to achieve the larger goal of safety.



"
Sekepe se ne se lebile kae ha ketsahalo e etsahala? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sekepe sa sehlopha sa Avenger sa mehato e kgahlanong le dibomo tsa metsing, sekepe sena se ne se le tseleng ya sona ho ya **Puerto Princesa mane Palawan**."" 

This means the ship was *on its way to* Puerto Princesa, which is in Palawan. Therefore, the event happened while it was traveling towards Palawan.



"
Ke eng e boletsweng seratswaneng e seng nnete ka sekepe?,"The correct answer is **C: Ke sekepe se thibelang liqhomane**.

Here's why:

The passage states the ship is an ""Avenger-class mine countermeasures vessel.""  ""Mine countermeasures"" means it deals with *mines*, not submarines (liqhomane).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Se ne se le tseleng e yang Puerto Princesa** - The passage explicitly states it was *on its way* to Puerto Princesa.
*   **B: Se fumaneha sehlekehlekeng sa Palawan** - The passage says it was *heading towards* Palawan, not that it was found there.
*   **D: Se fuwe mokhahlelo wa Sventh Fleet wa sesole sa Amerika sa metsing** - The passage confirms it is assigned to the U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet.



"
Ke mang ya ntshitseng polelo ka mabotho a Amerika?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

The passage clearly states that ""President of the United States, Donald Trump, announced that US forces would withdraw from Syria."""
"Ho ya ka polelo, ke naha efe e nkileng boikarabello ba ho lebela batshwaruwa ba ntwa?","The correct answer is **D: Turkey**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Turkey e ne e tla nka tshebetso ya ho disa balwanedi ba tshwerweng ba ISIS bao, polelo e itseng, dinaha tsa Yuropo di hanne ho nka karolo kgutlisong ya mabotho a tsona."" This directly translates to ""Turkey was going to take responsibility for dealing with ISIS prisoners that Europe had refused to take back."" 

Therefore, Turkey is the nation taking responsibility for the prisoners.



"
Ho belaelwa sesosa sa kotsi ebile sefe?,"The correct answer is **D: Maemo a mabe a lehodimo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Boiteko ba ho batlana le sebaka sa ho swahlamana bo thulane le **maemo a lehodimo a mabe** le sebaka se thata ho fihlelleha."" This directly links the bad weather to the difficulty in locating the crash site.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sebaka se sa tsamaeng habobebe** - While the area is difficult to reach, the passage doesn't say this *caused* the crash or hampered the search.
*   **B: Mollo o sa laoleheng** - There is no mention of fire in the passage.
*   **C: Sebaka se dithabeng** - The mountainous terrain is mentioned, but not as the cause of the difficulty in finding the crash site – the weather is.



"
Ke mofuteng ofe wa sebaka seo kotsi e etsahetseng?,"The correct answer is **D: Bo dithaba** (Mountains).

The text specifically states the crash happened ""hodimo sebakeng se dithabeng"" (in a mountainous area).  The other options don't describe the *location* of the crash:

* **A: Bo seng hantle** - This means 'good' or 'proper' and doesn't relate to location.
* **B: Bo thata** - This means 'difficulty' and describes the conditions, not the place.
* **C: Ba selekane** - This refers to the coalition forces, not a place.



"
Ba boholong ba lebelletse eng ka tshepo ka mora likgohola?,"The correct answer is **A: Tsosoloso ya lehlabathe le lebopong la lewatle** (Restoration of the earth and coastline).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...baofisiri ba tshepa hore bo lekane ho busetsa dithibella tsa mela ya lehlabathe tse hoholetsweng tlase ke metsi."" ( ""...officials hope it is enough to restore the roots of coastal vegetation submerged by the water."") 

This directly refers to the hope for the restoration of the earth/land and coastline vegetation after the dams are removed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tshimoloho ya mabopo a lewatle** (Formation of coastlines) - The passage doesn't mention new coastlines forming, but restoring existing ones.
*   **C: Palo e eketsehileng ya dithlapi tsa humpback chubs** (Increased number of humpback chub fish) - The passage says the fish are endangered and at risk of extinction.
*   **D: Sebaka sa dimela le diphoofolo tsa naheng** (Habitat for local plants and animals) - While this is a consequence of restoring the land, the *direct* hope expressed is for the restoration itself.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e amehileng ka ho sa feleng ke ho hahwa ha letamo?","The correct answer is **C: Dimela le diphoofolo tse hlaha**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the dam was built to create ""breeding grounds for terrestrial and marine animals.""** This directly links the dam's construction to impacting the habitat and lifecycle of plants and animals.
* The dam led to the decline/endangerment of fish species (B), and the need to restore submerged vegetation (A) which are both *results* of the impact on the ecosystem including plants and animals.
* While the change in water level (D) is *caused* by the dam, the core issue is the impact on the animals and plants relying on that habitat.

Therefore, the overarching thing continuously affected by the dam's construction is the plants and animals dependent on the river ecosystem.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang ya fileng Amerika menyenyetsi ka khonahalo ya tlhaselo?","The correct answer is **C: Mohlodi wa ditaba o patilweng**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""U.S. e re e fumane tlhahisoleseding ho tswa **mohloding o sa senolwang** o bolelang ka ho qolleha hore..."" This translates to ""U.S. says it received information from an **unnamed source** indicating...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Marabele a Somalia:** The text says ""balwanedi ba majelathoko ho tswa Somalia"" *are planning* the attack, but they didn't *provide* the information to the U.S.
*   **B: Ntlo ya boemedi ba dinaha ya Ethiopia:** The Ethiopian parliament is mentioned as a potential target, not as a source of information.
*   **D: Mohlodi wa ditaba o naheng ya Kenya:** While Kenya is a potential target, the text doesn't say a Kenyan news source provided the intelligence.



"
Ke dipolelo dife ho tse latelang tse hlalosang ka nepo morero wa tlhaselo wa marabele?,"The correct answer is **C: Ho phahlola dibomo dibakeng tsa bohlokwa dinaheng tse pedi**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the intelligence indicates the militants intend to attack ""important infrastructure"" in **both** Ethiopia **and** Kenya.  Options A and D only mention one country, and option B only mentions attacking structures, not specifically *important infrastructure*.



"
"Ho ba latelang, ke mang eo e seng ramolao?","The correct answer is **D: Makis Triantafylopoulos**.

Here's why:

* **Petros Mantouvalos** is explicitly stated to be a ""ramolao"" (lawyer/legal professional) and a member of Parliament.
* **Sakis Kechgioglou** and **George Nikolakopoulos** were convicted of corruption and bribery - they are implicated in illegal acts and therefore likely part of the legal profession.
* **Makis Triantafylopoulos** is described as a journalist (""moqolotsi wa ditaba""). He *reported* on the scandal but wasn't involved in the illegal activities himself. He's a reporter, not a lawyer.



"
Ke sehlopha sefe sa batho seo ho sa bolelwang se nkile karolo manyofonyofong kahara ditaba tsa molao ho setjhaba sa Magerike? ,"The correct answer is **A: Mofuta wa bo Ramolao wa Solicitors**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...mahlabisa-dihlong a maholo kahare ho setjhaba sa Magerike a hlahisitswe ka ho senolwa ha diketso tse seng molaong tseo **baahlodi, boramolao, babuelli ba molao ba phahameng le ba tlase** ba di entseng dilemong tse fetileng.""  Then it specifically mentions a MP and lawyer, Petros Mantouvalos, being implicated. This points to lawyers (boramolao/solicitors) being a key part of the scandal.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Baahlodi (Judges):** While a high-ranking judge (Evangelos Kalousis) was implicated, the text broadly highlights issues across *multiple* legal professions, not just judges.
*   **C: Baphatlalatsi (Publishers):**  The publishers are indirectly involved through the journalist Makis Triantafylopoulos, but they didn't *participate* in the wrongdoing.
*   **D: Babuelli (Advocates/Lawyers):** This is too broad. The text specifically focuses on the *corruption* of both judges *and* lawyers. ""Mofuta wa bo Ramolao wa Solicitors"" is the more precise group being implicated.



"
India e lahlehetswe ke mekhahlelo e mekae ya di wicket?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The passage states: ""Empa, kamora ho lahlehelwa ke wikete ya mokaptene India e fumane mabelo a 36 feela moo e lahlehetsweng ke diwikete tse 7 ho phethela makga a yona a papadi."" This translates to: ""But after losing the captain's wicket, India scored only 36 runs, losing 7 wickets to complete its innings.""

Therefore, India lost 7 wickets."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke dinthla tse ka hodimo ke tse kae tse fumanweng ka ho otlwa ha bolo ka bete?","The correct answer is **A: Di-run tse 70**.

The passage states: ""Robin Uthappa o fihletse dintlha tse phahameng ka ho fetisisa tsa lekga la papadi, mabelo a 70 ka dibolo tse 41..."" This directly says Robin Uthappa scored the highest runs of 70.
"
"Ho tse latelang, ke eng e sa bakang pherekano ho Adam Cuerden?","The correct answer is **A: Leano le letjha la ditaba tsa thobalano ho marangrang**.

Here's why:

The passage states the public outcry *led to* an attempt to draft a policy regarding erotic content. This implies the policy itself isn't the source of Cuerden's frustration, but rather a consequence of it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ho hlakolwa hwa botaki ba Wales** - The passage explicitly states Cuerden is upset about the deletion of Wales' contributions.
* **C: Ho se mamelwe ke Wales** - Cuerden feels Wales *pretended* to listen, but didn’t, which is a major source of his frustration.
* **D: Mafosisa ka sesosa sa ho hlakola botaki ba Wales** -  Cuerden feels Wales used legal reasons as a pretext and then ignored him, meaning he's upset *about* the reasons for the deletion.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana see, ke eng e hlakotsweng ho marangrang?","The correct answer is **B: Ditaba tsa thobalano**.

The passage states that public outcry led to an attempt to ""draw up a plan regarding pornography"" after Adam Cuerden spoke to Wikinews. Therefore, pornography (or sexually explicit content) is what was being removed from the network.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke eng e sa tshehetsweng ke Amir Khan?","The correct answer is **A: Ho kenyeletsa bahlabani ba basadi diolimpiking**.

The passage explicitly states Amir Khan believes ""basadi ha ba lokela ho lwana"" and therefore doesn't support women's inclusion in boxing at the Olympics. The other options are either things he *does* support (B, D) or not directly addressed in the passage (C)."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng eo Amir Khan a tla e tshehetsa ho sa tsotellehe maikutlo a hae?","The correct answer is **C: Diolimpiki tsa selemo sa 2012**.

Here's why:

The passage states that despite his opinion that women shouldn't fight, Amir Khan ""said he would support the British athletes at the 2012 London Olympics.""  This clearly indicates he will support the 2012 Olympics regardless of his personal views on women's boxing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bahlabani ba basadi** - He specifically says he doesn't think women *should* fight, so supporting female athletes is unlikely.
*   **B: Bahlodisani mmoho le yena ho tloha diodimpiking tsa selemo sa 2004** - The passage doesn't mention supporting his fellow competitors from 2004.
*   **D: Dibapadi tse hapileng khau ya selifera** - While he *is* a silver medalist, the passage doesn't say he'll specifically support other silver medalists.



"
Peter Lenz o hlokahetse neng?,"The correct answer is **A: Nakong ya mokgahlelo wa boikwetliso pele ho papadi** (During a practice session before the race).

The passage states ""Ha a ntse a le lekgeng la boikwetliso ba hae, Lenz a wa sethuthuthung sa hae..."" which means he died during a practice session.
"
Ke mang Xavier Zayat?,"The correct answer is **B: Sebapadi se seng** (Another racer).

The text states ""Xavier Zayat, a fellow racer..."" meaning he is a racer like Peter Lenz. The other options don't fit the information provided in the text."
Ke maemong afe ao mopalami wa sefofane ya tshohileng a ka nnang a una molemo ka ho utlwisisa tshebetso ya ka hare ya sefofane?,"The correct answer is **B: Haeba ho se rate ho fofa hwa bona ho bakwa ke tshabo eo ba sa tsebeng na e tswa kae**.

Here's why:

The passage states that understanding *how* a plane works and *what* happens during flight can help overcome fear based on the unknown or lack of control.  Option B directly addresses this – someone who dislikes flying due to an unexplained fear would benefit most from learning about the mechanics of flight.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Haeba mopalami a hlajwa ke dihlong ke tshabo ya hae** - While this is true, the passage isn't about *causing* fear, but overcoming it.
* **C: Haeba mopalami a sa rate mefuta yohle ya dipalangwang** - This is too broad.  The passage specifically addresses fear of *flying*.
* **D: Haeba matshweyeho a hae a bakwa ke diketsahalo tse sithabetsang empa di sa amane le ho fofa** - The passage specifically mentions that fear is often worse for those with *no* previous positive experience or a *negative* experience. This option talks about unrelated experiences.



"
"Ho ipapisitswe le seratswana, ke eng eo moeti ya sedi ka taba ya ditjeo a ka e etsang?","The correct answer is **C: Ho bapisa ditjeo dipakeng tsa dikhamphani tse ngata tsa maeto** (To compare prices between many travel companies).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""sefofane se tshwanang se ka eba le ditheko tse fapaneng haholo tsa dikhamphani tse fapa-fapaneng mme hape ho na le molemo ho bapisa diphello tsa ho etsa patlisiso"" (the same flight can have very different prices from different companies, and it is also beneficial to compare the results of doing research). This directly supports the idea of comparing prices between different travel companies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho sheba dinyehlisetso tse etswang ke dikhampani tsa maeto** (To check offers made by travel companies) - While related, the passage focuses on comparing *prices*, not just looking at offers.
*   **B: Ho lefella leeto khampaning ya maeto ka kotloloho** (To pay for the flight directly with a travel company) - The passage suggests *against* this without comparison shopping.
*   **D: Ho sheba marangrang a difofane** (To check the airlines' websites) - The passage does mention checking airline websites, but as *part of* the research and comparison process, not as the only step.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng eo baeti ba tshwanelang ho e etsa pele e le ho beheletsa leeto le ditjeo di bobebe?","The correct answer is **B: Ho bapisa ditjeo ho marangrang a mang**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""se fofane se tshwanang se ka eba le ditheko tse fapaneng haholo tsa dikhamphani tse fapa-fapaneng mme hape ho na le molemo ho bapisa diphello tsa ho etsa patlisiso.""  This means travelers should compare prices from different sources before booking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho sheba marangrang a difofane** - While checking the airline website is *part* of the research, the passage emphasizes comparing across *different* companies.
* **C: Ho lefella ka kotloloho ho khamphani ya difofane** - The passage doesn’t say anything about *how* to pay, only about researching prices first.
* **D: Ho lefella ka kotloloho ho ejente ya maeto** - Similar to C, this isn't the main point of the passage.



"
Motho eo o tsamayang le yena o lebeletswe ho felehetsa thepa neng?,"The correct answer is **C: Ha thepa e posetswa ka kotloloho sebakeng seo mopalami a yang ho sona**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Ka kakaretso, tsela e potlakileng ea ho kena ka har'a meetlo ke ho e tsamaisa joalo ka ha e hlahlojoa ka har'a thoto."" This means the fastest way to get goods through customs is to treat them as if they are being shipped directly to the final destination. This implies the person accompanying the goods is there to facilitate this process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ha dintho di romelwa ka sefofane** - The passage actually states that air freight can *delay* things due to customs processes.
*   **B: Ha khamphani e sebedisa difofane tsa yona** - While large companies may have their own planes, the passage doesn't link this to a need for an accompanying person.
*   **D: Ha thepa e tsamaiswa ke khamphani e kholo** - Size of the company isn't the key factor. It's about how the shipment is handled for customs."
"Ho latela seratswana, ha o khetha sefofane sa Frequent Flyer sa selekane, ke ntho e feng ya bohlokwa eo o lokelang ho e sheba?","The correct answer is **A: Khampani ya difofane e fanang ka dintlha tse ngata** (The airline that offers the most points).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that points can vary *significantly* between airlines, even within the same alliance. It advises you to be aware that an airline you fly often might not give you as many points as another. Therefore, the *number of points offered* is the crucial factor to consider.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Khamphani ya difofane e selekaneng se seholo** (The airline with the largest alliance) - The passage warns against assuming the biggest alliance is best.
*   **C: Khamphani ya difofane eo o e sebelisang haholo ho phetha maeto** (The airline you use the most for travel) - While convenient, it may not offer the best rewards.
*   **D: Khampani ya difofane tse ka nnang tsa eketsa melemo** (The airline that may increase benefits) - The passage doesn’t suggest looking at potential future benefits, but at *current* points offered.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke khamphani e feng ya difofane e ka nnang ya fana ka dintlha tse ngata ha motho a e sebedisa hangata?","The correct answer is **A: Khamphani ya difofane e fapaneng, e selekaneng se fapaneng** (A different airline, in a different alliance).

Here's why:

The passage states ""...dintlha tsa ho fofa hangata e ka ba tse ngata haholo tlase ha k’hampani ya difofane e selekaneng se tshwanang"" - meaning frequent flyer points can be *much lower* if you stick to an airline *within the same alliance*.  Therefore, to maximize points, you should choose an airline *outside* of your most frequent airline's alliance.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke kutlo e fe e ka feliswang ke bokgoba ba tahi?","The correct answer is **B: Pono**.

Here's why:

The text states that illicit alcohol can contain dangerous substances like methanol. Methanol can cause blindness (pofo), even in small amounts. The text directly links methanol to the loss of sight (""bofofu"").

The other options are not mentioned in the text as being affected by alcohol consumption, especially illicit alcohol. Therefore, ""Pono"" (sight) is the only logical answer.



"
"Jwalo kaha ho hlalositswe seratswaneng, ke eng e ka fokotsang ditlamorao tsa jwala?","The correct answer is **C: Ho nwa jwala ka tekanyetso (Drinking alcohol in moderation)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""E nwa dino tse tahang ka tekatekano"" which translates to ""Drink in moderation."" and ""Ho tseba moedi wa hao ho bohlokwa"" which means ""Knowing your limit is important."" This emphasizes that controlling consumption is key to reducing harm.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho kopanya jwala le methanol (Mixing alcohol with methanol):** The passage *warns* against methanol, stating it's a dangerous contaminant that can cause blindness or death.
* **B: Ho nwa majwala a tswekere a seng molaong (Drinking illegal alcohol):** The passage specifically states that illegal alcohol carries *increased* risks due to potentially dangerous contaminants.
* **D: Ho nwa jwala le batho ba fapaneng (Drinking alcohol with different people):** This doesn't relate to reducing the *effects* of alcohol, but rather the social aspect.



"
Ke dibaka dife toropng ya Amsterdam moo matlo a turang haholo?,"The correct answer is **A: Seterekeng sa Canal**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...theko ya sona ya thepa e ka hare ha tse phahameng ka ho fetisisa naheng"" (its property prices are among the highest in the country) *in the Canal District*.  While the other options relate to historical significance, the passage directly links high property prices to the Canal District.



"
"Hobaneng Setereke sa Canal se kgethilwe e le Sebaka sa Nalane Boemong ba Lefatshe sa Mokgatlo wa Lefatshe wa Thuto, Mahlale, Botjhaba le Dikgokahanyo?","The correct answer is **A: Ke sebaka sa boleng sa nalane le botjhaba**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the Canal District was chosen as a UNESCO World Heritage site ""bakeng sa boleng ba sona bo ikgethang ba setso le ba histori"" (for its unique cultural and historical value). This directly translates to being a place of outstanding universal value – the criteria for UNESCO designation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Matlo a yona a ikgethang (Its unique houses):** While the houses *contribute* to its value, they aren't the sole reason for the UNESCO designation.
*   **C: Ke sebaka se potapotileng Binnestad (It's an area surrounding Binnestad):** Location is not a reason for UNESCO designation.
*   **D: Boleng ba yona bo hodimo ba matlo a teng (The high value of its properties):** Property value doesn't determine historical or cultural significance.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse lateng, ke ntho efe e etsang hore ho tjhakela Phnom Krom ho be le boleng?","The correct answer is **A: Tjhebahalo e ntle e hodima letsha la Tonle Sap** (The beautiful view over Tonle Sap lake).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Tikoloho e sa hlakang ya tempele le ho shebahala ha letsha la Tonle Sap ho etsa ho palamela leralleng ho tshwanelehe.""  This means the clear surroundings *and* the view of Tonle Sap lake make climbing the hill worthwhile.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ho tsamaya lekgalong la Angkor** (Traveling the Angkor Pass) - The Angkor Pass is *required* to enter, but it doesn't make the experience specifically valuable, it's just a requirement.
*   **C: Ho bona Siem Reap** (Seeing Siem Reap) - The text doesn't mention anything about viewing Siem Reap from Phnom Krom.
*   **D: Leeto la seketswana ho ya letsheng** (Short boat trip to the island) - This is a way to *get* there, not a reason why Phnom Krom is valuable.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, keng se hlokuwang ho baeti hore ba kene thoteng ya Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **C: Ho fihla lekgalong la Angkor**.

The text states: ""Tsela ya ho Feta ya Angkor ya hlokeha hore o kene tempeleng kahoo o seke wa lebala ho tla le phasepoto ya hao ha o ya Tonle Sap."" This directly means that an Angkor Pass is required to enter Phnom Krom temple.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e ka thibelang bahahlaodi ho tjhakela sebakeng sa Antarctica?","The correct answer is **D: Ho sitwa ho tsamaya**.

Here's why:

The passage states Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth, heavily iced and covered in ice sheets 2-3 kilometers thick. This inherently makes travel *difficult*. The passage also mentions research trips are only possible during the Antarctic summer (November to March) and often focus on the coastlines, indicating access to the interior is limited.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ditekanyetse tsa ditjhelete tse phahameng bakeng sa leeto:** While likely true, the passage doesn't mention cost as a barrier to explorers.
*   **B: Ho kgahlwa feela ke ho ya lewatleng la Ross:** The passage states trips *often end* at the Ross Sea, not that it's the only place people are interested in.
*   **C: Lethathamo la mosebetsi le dumellang moeti ho tsamaya ka Tshitwe le ka Pherekgong:** The passage doesn’t mention restrictions based on the month or work schedule.

Therefore, the most direct answer, based on the information given, is that the harsh environment and ice make *travel* (ho tsamaya) the biggest constraint."
Mohahlaudi ya nang le kgahleho ho dipapadi tsa dithabeng a ka tjhakela karolo efe ya Antarctica?,"The correct answer is **D: Dihlekehleke**.

Here's why:

The text states that expeditions often end up in ""Hlwahlweng, Dihlekehlekeng le Lewatleng la Ross."" It also mentions that researchers sometimes ""climb mountains"" within the continent.  Since the question specifically asks about mountain climbing (dipapadi tsa dithabeng), the **Dihlekehleke** (mountains) are the most logical place for a climber to focus their efforts.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lewatle la Ross:** This is a sea, not a mountain range.
*   **B: Dibaka tse hole le lebopo la lewatle:** This is too general. While mountains are inland, this doesn't pinpoint a specific location.
*   **C: Hlwahlweng:** This refers to a general area, but doesn't specify mountain climbing opportunities.



"
Sebaka sa khale sa ho boha se ka fumaneha kae moo ho seng bobebe hore se fumanehe?,"The correct answer is **C: Sebakeng se hole le toropo (Away from the city)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that older observatories are now often museums or educational sites and that *modern* research observatories are built in remote locations with favorable environmental conditions (specifically to avoid light pollution).  This implies the older, more accessible observatories were *in* cities, while those needing dark skies are *away* from cities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sebakeng se fumanehang ha bobebe (In a dimly lit place)** - While darkness is important, it's not just about dimness, but the absence of city lights.
*   **B: Ka hara toropo (Inside the city)** - The passage implies older observatories were *in* cities, but we're looking for where a *current* observatory seeking dark skies would be.
*   **D: Ka hara sekolo sa koleche (Inside a college/university)** - While some observatories are affiliated with universities, the passage emphasizes the *location* being remote for research purposes."
Khamera ya telescope ya dipatlisiso e ka behwa sebakeng sefe?,"The correct answer is **D: Sebakeng se seholo** (A large area/place).

Here's why:

The passage states that modern research telescopes are often in ""dibaka tse kgolohadi tse leng dibakeng tse hole ka maemo a tikoloho a ratehang"" - meaning they are in *large, remote areas with favorable environmental conditions*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sebaka sa poloko ya lintho tsa khale** (Museum/Historical storage) - The passage says old telescopes are *in* museums, not modern research telescopes.
*   **B: Kahara Junifesithi** (Within a University) - While universities *use* telescopes, the passage emphasizes the telescopes themselves are built in remote locations.
*   **C: Sebakeng ba boithuto** (Educational area) - Similar to B, educational areas *benefit* from telescopes, but are not where they are *located* for optimal research.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke sebaka sefe se khutsitseng hantle ho ka etela lebopo letshehare lohle?","The correct answer is **A: St Heliers**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ka dinako mabopo ana a tlala malapa a mangata le mokoloko o moholo wa mabenkele a kolokileng koung. Motho o sireletsehile ha a sesa moo."" referring to Tamaki Drive, and specifically mentions both Mission Bay *and* St Heliers as locations along that drive. However, the text doesn't indicate St Heliers is more crowded.

The question asks for the *most relaxing* place to visit a beach. Considering this, **St Heliers** is the best answer, as both Mission Bay and St Heliers are described as safe swimming spots with shops and families, but St Heliers is the place that would be most relaxing to go for a stroll.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mission Bay:** Mentioned with St Heliers, so it's not *specifically* the most relaxing.
*   **C: Setereke sa North Harbor:** This is a larger area, not a specific beach for relaxing.
*   **D: Waitemata Harbor:** This is the name of the harbour, not a beach itself."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke sebaka sefe se bolokehileng ka ho fitisisa bakeng sa ho sesa?","The correct answer is **A: Devonport**.

Here's why:

The text states that the beaches of the North Shore (including those from Long Bay to Devonport) are ""completely sheltered beaches where one can swim safely"". While other locations are mentioned as safe, Devonport is specifically named as part of that safe stretch of coastline.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Setereke sa North Harbor** - This is a larger area, and while it *contains* safe beaches, it doesn't pinpoint a specifically safe spot.
*   **C: Central Auckland** - The text mentions Tamaki Drive in Central Auckland is safe, but doesn't highlight it as *the most* safe.
*   **D: Long Bay** - Long Bay is mentioned as a starting point for the safe beaches, but Devonport is stated to be within the safe area too.



"
"Ha o etetse sebaka se hlalositsweng seratswaneng, ke ntho efe ho tse latelang e nkuwang e le ho se hlomphe?","The correct answer is **C: Ho etsa metlae**.

Here's why:

The prompt explicitly states ""O se ke wa etsa metlae ka Holocaust kapa Manazi.""  This makes making light of the situation or trivializing it the most disrespectful act possible given the context of a deeply significant and tragic place.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho itshwara ka tsela e hlomphehang** - This is *respectful*, not disrespectful.
* **B: Ho siya letshwoa kae-kae setsheng seo** - Littering is generally disrespectful, but it's not specifically mentioned in the prompt as a grave offense in this context.
* **D: Ho ngwapa seterakatjhara** - Taking pictures is not inherently disrespectful, though excessive or inappropriate photography could be.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke lintho dife tse hlalosang dipuo tsa fanakalo?","The correct answer is **C: E hlophisitsweng** (Constructed).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that constructed languages are ""hlophisitsweng"" (organized/constructed) with the *purpose* of facilitating communication where natural language barriers exist.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ya maiketsetso** (Artificial) - While constructed languages *are* artificial, ""hlophisitsweng"" is a more precise descriptor in the context of the passage, emphasizing the deliberate organization.
* **B: E sa tlwaelehang** (Unusual) -  This is too broad. Many things are unusual, but it doesn't define what constructed languages *are*.
* **D: E sa hlapholwang** (Unrefined) - Constructed languages can be very refined and carefully planned.



"
Ke polelo efe e sa haloseng ka nepo dipuo tseo eseng tsa mathomo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ke dipuo tse etseditsweng ho matlafatsa puisano boemong boo batho ba sa utlwisisaneng**

Here's why:

* **The passage defines constructed languages as those created to *facilitate communication between people who have difficulty communicating*.**  Option C directly reflects this purpose – languages designed to improve communication when people don't naturally understand each other.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ke dipou tse sa hlaphollwang tse sebediswang ho fetisa molaetsa dipakeng tsa batho ba buang dipuo tse fapaneng** - While constructed languages *are* used for communication between speakers of different languages,  ""sa hlaphollwang"" (unnatural) isn't the key defining characteristic.  The *purpose* of facilitation is more important.
* **B: Ke dipuo tsa mathomo le tse iketseditsweng** -  ""tsa mathomo"" (natural/original) is the opposite of what the passage describes constructed languages as being.
* **D: Dipuo tse iketseditsweng tse ka sehloohong lipakeng tsa batho ba buang dipuo tse fapaneng** -  This is too specific.  Constructed languages aren’t necessarily *primarily* for people speaking different languages, they are for bridging communication gaps.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng seo bapalami ba lokelang ho se ela hloko haeba leeto la bona la sekepe le ha ho le mariha?","The correct answer is **B: Dipehelo tsa ho fumana visa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ha ho hlokehe ditlhoko tsa visa ho bapalami ba sekepe sa bahahlaudi (hlola maemo).""  This directly implies that passengers need to be aware of *conditions* (dipehelo) regarding visa requirements - there are exceptions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sebaka sa ho beha thepa sekepeng** - The text doesn't mention luggage space.
*   **C: Dipehelo** - While the text does mention conditions, it's specifically about *visa* conditions.
*   **D: Nako eo a e qetang toropong** - The text mentions the ships are visiting, but doesn't state passengers need to be aware of the length of stay.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, haeba leeto la sekepe la mopalami le ka ba hlabula, ke sefe seo a ka nnang a se qoba?","The correct answer is **C: Dipehelo tsa ho fumana visa**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Ha ho hlokehe ditlhoko tsa visa ho bapalami ba sekepe sa bahahlaudi (hlola maemo).""  This means that being on the cruise ship *avoids* the need for a visa. If the cruise were to fail, the traveler would then need to deal with visa requirements.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nako toropong** - The text mentions time in the city, but it's not something you'd *avoid* by being on the cruise.
*   **B: Ho feta hara maqhwa** - While the passage mentions the Baltic Sea and possibly ice (""ho tsamaya leqhweng""), it doesn't suggest the cruise avoids going through ice.
*   **D: Saint Petersberg** - Saint Petersburg is a destination the cruise visits; it's not something to be avoided.



"
Hobaneng puo ya Catalan e sebeliswa khafetsa matshwaong le ho etsa ditsebiso toropong ya Barcelona?,"The correct answer is **B: Ke puo ya pele ya se-molao toropong eo**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""matshwao a mangata a bontshwa feela ka Secatalan hobane se hlomamisitswe ka molao e le puo ya pele ya molao."" This directly explains why Catalan is frequently used on signs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E utlwisiseha ho feta puo ya Spanish** - The text says about half the people speak Catalan, but most understand it, implying Spanish is *more* widely understood.
*   **C: Ke puo e thahasellwang toropong ya Barcelona** - The text doesn't mention anything about Catalan being particularly interesting.
*   **D: Sebaka sa diterene tse tsamayang tlasa lefatshe le dibaka tse ding tse etelwang khafetsa ke batho ba buang puo ya Calatan** - The text mentions the train station as an example, but doesn’t suggest it’s *because* those locations are frequented by Catalan speakers. The announcements are simply made in Catalan.



"
Ke puo efe ho tse latelang e sebeliswang ho etsa ditsebiso ke setsi sa toropo ya Barcelona sa diterene tse tsamayang ka tlasa lefatshe?,"The correct answer is **B: Catalan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ditsebiso tsa kamehla Seteisheneng sa Terene di etswa feela ka Secatalan..."" (Routine announcements at the train station are made only in Catalan...)

Therefore, Catalan is the primary language used for announcements. While other languages are used for disruptions, regular information is given in Catalan."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke ntho efe ya dintho tse khahlisang eo ho seng bobebe ho hlwauwa ele ya bohlokwa ke matlo a bodulo a maemo a phahameng?","The correct answer is **B: Thepa ya ka tlung ya mehleng ya khale, e ikhethang** (Antique furnishings).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that high-end B&Bs often feature ""moaho wa kgale wa histori o nang le thepa ya boholo-holo, dirapa tse kgabisitsweng le letamo la ho sesa"" (historic buildings with antique furnishings, decorated rooms, and fireplaces).  This highlights the importance of unique, older items in creating a luxurious experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lethathamo la dijo tse ikhethang** (Unique menu): While special breakfasts are mentioned, they are presented *alongside* the furnishings, not as the primary distinguishing factor.
*   **C: Dibaka tsa kantle tse bolokilweng ka makhethe** (Manicured outdoor spaces): The passage doesn't mention anything about gardens or outdoor areas.
*   **D: Marang-rang a hlwahlwa** (Loose carpets): The passage mentions high-quality bedding (""lesela la ho kwahela bethe le entsweng ka letsoho""), but not loose carpets.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke ntho efe eseng ya tse ding tsa dintlha tsa bohlokwa ho qothisaneng lehlokwa hwa matlo a boroko a maemo a hodimo?","The correct answer is **A: Mekgabiso ya mmala e kopaneng**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions two key things high-end B&Bs compete on: **bedding** and **breakfast**. It specifically describes luxurious bedding (hand-made quilts, oversized beds) and special, often local, breakfasts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Khetho ya dijo tsa hoseng e fapaneng ho latela dinako tsa selemo** - While a variety is implied with ""local specialties,"" seasonal choices aren't specifically mentioned as a *competitive point*.
* **C: Dikobo le masela a bethe tsa boemo bo hodimo** - The passage *directly* states high-end B&Bs compete on luxurious bedding.
* **D: Dijo le terinki tse fumanehang haufinyane** - The passage does mention locally sourced breakfast, so this aligns with what's described.

**Mekgabiso ya mmala e kopaneng** (coordinated color schemes) isn't mentioned at all in the text, making it the only option that isn't a key competitive element.

"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e sa tlo tshwarelwa toropong ya Beijing ka 2022?","The correct answer is **B: Dipapadi tsa ho theledisa lehlweng sebakeng sa Taizicheng**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that ""Dipapadi tse ding tse ding tsa ho thellisa leqhweng di tla ba sebakeng sa ho thellisa leqhweng sa Taizicheng e ileng Zhangjiakou, ho e ka bang 220 km (di-mile tse 140) ho tloha Beijing."" This means these events will NOT be held in Beijing.

The passage also says that Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies and the indoor ice events.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke dintho dife tse tla tshwarelwa Beijing ka selemo sa 2022?","The correct answer is **C: Diolimpiki tsa mariha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Toropo ya Beijing e leng Chaena e tla ba toropo eo ho tshwarelwang Dipapadi tsa Mariha tsa Diolimpiki tsa 2022..."" This directly indicates that Beijing will host the 2022 Winter Olympics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Diolompki tsa Lehlabula** - The passage explicitly mentions Beijing hosted both Summer and *Winter* Olympics, but focuses on the 2022 Winter Games.
*   **B: Dipapadi tsa lehlweng tsa ka tlung** - While some indoor ice sports will be held in Beijing, this isn't the *entire* event.
*   **D: Mekete e kwalang dipapadi** - The passage mentions the opening and closing ceremonies, but that's part of the broader Olympic event, not the sole thing Beijing will host.



"
Ke batho bafe ba tlokotsing e kgolo ya ho fumana tshwaetso ya lefuba la avian?,"The correct answer is **C: Basebetsi ba dikhohong (Poultry workers)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Tse ngata di akarelletsa batho ba sebetsang ka dikgoho, empa ho na le kotsi ho bashebelli ba dinonyana."" (Most cases involve people working with poultry, but there is a risk to bird watchers as well.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Batho ba ratang ho boha dinonyana (People who enjoy bird watching):** The text mentions they are *at risk*, but it's a lower risk than poultry workers.
*   **B: Batho ba sebetsang le diphoofolo tse nyantshang (People working with livestock):** While avian influenza *can* affect other animals, the primary risk is from poultry.
*   **D: Batho ba ileng ba tshwaetswa pele (People who have been infected before):**  Prior infection doesn't necessarily put someone at higher risk for future infection.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke dipolelo dife tse hlalosang ka nepo lefuba la dinonyana?","The correct answer is **C: Batho ba ratang ho boha dinonyana ba tlokotsing ya ho tshwaetswa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""...but there is a risk to bird watchers."" (empa ho na le kotsi ho bashebelli ba dinonyana.) Bird watchers are people who enjoy observing birds, which can include those who simply watch them or those who actively try to get close to them (like photographers or those observing them in the wild). This directly implies a risk to people who interact with birds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ke basebetsi feela ba dikhohong ba tshwerweng ke lefuba** - The passage states many cases *include* people working with poultry, but also notes there's a risk to bird watchers, meaning it's not *only* poultry workers.
*   **B: Dipalo tse ngata di fumanwe ho batho ho feta ho dinonyana** - The passage states the opposite – the disease affects both birds and animals, but cases in humans are in the ""lower thousands.""
*   **D: Dipalo tsohle tsa batho ba tshwaeditsweng ke tsa batho ba hlokahetseng** - The passage does not state that all human cases are related to work or a specific circumstance; it only mentions a risk to bird watchers.



"
Sekepe sa White sea-Baltic se kopanya eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Letsha la Onega le Noka ya Volga**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Letsha la Onega le boetse le hokahane le Volga, kahoo ho tloha Lewatleng la Caspian ho pholletsa Russia ho ntse ho ka khoneha."" This directly links the White Sea-Baltic Canal (which utilizes Lake Onega) with the Volga River, providing a route from the Caspian Sea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lewatle le Letsho le Lewatle la Caspian:** While the text mentions Russia accessing these seas, the canal itself doesn't *directly* connect them.
*   **C: Lewatle la Artic le Noka ya Baltic:** The canal connects the White Sea (Arctic) to the Baltic Sea, but doesn't mention a ""Noka ya Baltic"" (Baltic River).
*   **D: Lewatle le ka Borwa le Lewatle le Lefubedu:** These seas are not mentioned in the text in relation to the canal.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mofuteng ofe wa koloi moo diphasepoto di ka nkuwang e le ho qoba ho kena-kenana le bapalami?","The correct answer is **B: Diterene tsa bosiu**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ditereneng tseo ho robalwang ho tsona, phasepote e ka nkuwa ke mohlahlobi wa ditekete tsa terene hore o se wa sitiswa ha o se o robetse."" This means on overnight trains, conductors may collect tickets to avoid disturbing sleeping passengers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Difofane:** The passage mentions planes as examples of places where you need a ticket, but doesn't say tickets are *collected* to avoid disturbing anyone.
*   **C: Dikepe:** Same as with planes, they are examples but don't fit the specific scenario of ticket collection for sleep.
*   **D: Diterene tse yang kantle ho naha:** The passage mentions needing a valid ID for international trains, but not ticket collection to avoid disturbance.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, tokomana ya hao ya boitsebiso eka nna ya batluwa neng ditereneng tse yang kantle ho naha?","The correct answer is **A: Kamora ho theoha tereneng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sebaka sa ho hlola diphasepotso tsa bafalli ka ho tlwaelehileng ke sebaka sa ho qala seo o yang ho sona ha o theoha sefofaneng, sekepeng kapa sepalanngwang se seng."" This directly translates to ""The place to show passenger documents is usually the first place you go to when you get off a plane, ship, or other vehicle.""  Since trains are included in the ""other vehicle"" category, your documentation would be checked *after* you disembark.

"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e ka nnang ya o etsahalla ha o dula dibakeng tse pela bohare ba lefatshe naheng ya Singapore?","The correct answer is **C: Ho hlolwa ke motjheso (To be drenched by rain)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that being near the equator in Singapore means facing ""both humidity (at all times) and scorching sun (when the canopy breaks, which happens frequently).""  This implies frequent, heavy rainfall to accompany the humidity and breaks in the cloud cover.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho khothotswa (To be bored):** The passage doesn't suggest boredom. It describes a convenient and safe place.
*   **B: Ho se fumane mokgwa wa ho ya dishopong (To not be able to find a way to the shop):** The passage states it's easy to get around and you can buy anything you need.
*   **D: Ho lahleha (To get lost):**  The passage highlights how easy it is to navigate Singapore.



"
Ke mang ya ka nnang a batla ho qoba ho ja di-pastry tsa Majeremane?,"The correct answer is **A: Motho ya hlolwang ke dijo tsa dinatse haholo (Someone allergic to nuts)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that many German pastries include almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Someone with a nut allergy would need to avoid these pastries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Motho ya ratang mafatshe-thotomela a boemo bo hodimo (Someone who prefers high-end baked goods):** The passage describes German pastries as rich and varied, implying quality, not necessarily ""high-end"" in a specific price or prestige sense.
*   **C: Motho ya sa rateng ditjhokolete (Someone who doesn't like chocolate):** The passage doesn't mention chocolate as a primary ingredient, though it could be present in some variations. The focus is on nuts and fruit.
*   **D: Motho ya ratang dijo tse tswekere ho feta tse letswai (Someone who prefers sweet food over savory):** The passage describes the pastries as rich and flavorful, but it doesn't imply they are *only* for people who like very sweet food.



"
Ke eng eo molemo wa yona e leng ho natefisa di-pastry tsa Majeremane?,"The correct answer is **A: Diapole** (Apples).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...diphae tsa di-apole tse phehilweng tse kengwang diphaeng selemo kaofela..."" (apple pastries baked into pies all year round). This highlights apples as a common and important ingredient in German pastries.

The other options aren't mentioned as primary or particularly noteworthy ingredients in the text.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e ke keng ya ba keletso ho batho ba yang leetong ka tjhelete e lekaneng?","The correct answer is **C: Ho kopa batho tjhelete**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that the advice *does not* include begging (ho kope) as a way to travel on a budget. It emphasizes ethical and legal travel, and begging falls outside of those boundaries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho fumana mesebetsi ya nakwana ya katlung ha o le leetong** - This aligns with the idea of working while traveling, which the passage mentions as one of the two main approaches to budget travel.
*   **B: Ho dula o butse kelello le ha o natefetswe** - Staying open-minded is a generally good travel attitude and doesn't contradict the passage.
*   **D: Ho fokotsa ditjeo tse kang dijo le boroko** - Reducing expenses (like food and lodging) is the core of the second strategy discussed in the passage – minimizing costs.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang a ka bang le mathata ha ya leetong ka tjhelete e nyane?","The correct answer is **A: Motho ya amohelang phepetso** (A person who accepts bribes).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that budget travelers should *not* ""kope, kapa ho hanyapetsa batho ba bang hore ho rue bona"" - which translates to ""beg, or extort others for gain"". Accepting bribes (phepetso) falls directly under that category of unethical and potentially illegal behavior. The passage emphasizes ethical and legal travel even on a tight budget.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Motho ya se nang mathata ka taba ya nako** (A person who isn't bothered by time) - The passage doesn't mention time management being a problem for budget travelers.
* **C: Motho ya rerang ho sebeletsa ka thoko ho kantoro ya mosebetsi ha le leetong** (A person planning to work diligently at an office while traveling) -  The passage mentions working *while* traveling as a possibility, so diligent work isn't a problem.
* **D: Motho ya natefelwang ke ho latela melao ya ditaba tsa leeto la hae** (A person who enjoys following the rules of their travel affairs) - This is actually a *positive* trait for a budget traveler according to the passage!



"
"Hara dipolelo tse latelang, ke polelo efe e sa hlaloseng ka nepo tsela e dipakeng tsa Point Marion le Fairmont?","The correct answer is **C: Bakhanni ha ba ikobele taolo ya lebelo la molao**.

Here's why:

The passage *specifically* emphasizes the importance of obeying the posted speed limits (35-40 mph) and states that they are enforced. It highlights that sticking to those limits is crucial.  Option C directly contradicts this information.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: Ho na le ditsela tse telele tse maluting ka thoko ho toropo** - The text mentions winding roads and steep hills.
*   **B: Ditsela di mopatisane** - The text explicitly states the roads are narrow.
*   **D: Ditshebeletso tsa mehala ya thekeng ha di a lokela ho ba bothata** - The passage surprisingly points out that cell service is *stronger* in this area compared to others along the route.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e lokelang ho ba ngongoreho e kholo ho bakhanni ba sebedisang tsela e kholo ya Buffalo-Pittsburg?","The correct answer is **C: Ho tjeka huku ya tsela e kotsi ka sekgahla** (To encounter a dangerous road with difficulty).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the road between Point Marion and Fairmount is ""very challenging"" and warns drivers unfamiliar with mountain roads to be careful of:

*   **""dibaka tsa meepo""** (steep grades/hills)
*   **""ditsela tse tshesane""** (narrow roads)
*   **""methinya e bohale e tletse""** (sharp curves)

It also emphasizes that speed limits are lower than usual and must be obeyed.  These all point to a road that is difficult and potentially dangerous to navigate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho kwallwa ke sephethephethe se sengata** (Being overtaken by a lot of traffic): The passage doesn't mention heavy traffic.
*   **B: Ho se fumane tshebediso e lekaneng ya ditshebeletso tsa mara-ngrang** (Not getting enough cellular service):  The passage actually notes cellular service is *stronger* on this section of the road than other areas.
*   **D: Ho kopano le dibaka tse ngata tsa moo tsela e lokiswang** (Encountering many road construction areas): The passage doesn't mention construction.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e sa hlokahaleng hore motho a ka qala ho sesa ka seketswana?","The correct answer is **B: Boemo ba dilemo tseo motho a bang le matla haholo ho tsona**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that canyoneering requires ""kwetliso e nyenyane kapa ho itekanela mmeleng hore o qadise"" (little or no fitness to get started). It contrasts this with activities like rock climbing, scuba diving, and skiing which *do* require significant fitness. It also mentions skills like swimming and jumping are involved. Therefore, a specific level of physical strength gained with age isn't mentioned as a prerequisite.
"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e ka hlokahalang ho etsa hore leeto la ho sesa ka seketswana e be le atlehileng?","The correct answer is **D: Ho tseba ho sesa** (Knowing how to swim).

Here's why:

The passage states that canyoneering ""includes elements of swimming..."" and that it requires ""little or no fitness or athletic ability to begin"". This implies that the *basic* requirement is knowing how to swim, as it's a core part of the activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Boiphehlelo bo hodimo mmeleng ho tsa dipapadi:** (High upper body strength for rappelling) - While rappelling *is* part of canyoneering, the passage says you don't need a lot of fitness to start, implying upper body strength isn't essential at the beginning.
*   **B: Boiphelo ditabeng tsa ho qwela ka metsing:** (Experience in aquatic climbing) - This is a more advanced skill, not a basic requirement.
*   **C: Ho tiiswa ka molao ditabeng tsa ho sesa ka seketswana:** (Legal certification in canyon swimming) - The passage doesn't mention any certification requirements.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke ntho efe e ka bang bohlokwa ho motho ya rerang ho khempa ka koloing ya hae?","The correct answer is **B: Koloi e dumellang ditulo hore di sekame** (A car that allows the seats to recline).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ho kampa koloing ho ka etsahala haeba o na le vene, SUV, Sedan kapa Station Wagon se se nang le ditulo tse kgonang ho robala.""  This means the *ability to sleep in the car* (reclinable seats) is essential for car camping.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kutlwisiso e matla tabeng ya hore na koloi ya hao e ka se etse eng le eng** (Strong understanding of what your car can and can't do) - While important for any road trip, it's not *specifically* what makes car camping possible.
*   **C: Tente** (Tent) - The passage points out that car camping might *avoid* the need for a tent.
*   **D: Sebaka sa monga sona seo motho a ka khempang ho sona** (A scenic place where one can camp) - A nice place to camp is desirable, but doesn't define car camping itself.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, bo-ramakoloi ba khempang ba ka batla ho qoba eng haeba ba batla ho dula tlasa reidara?","The correct answer is **C: Ho hloma tente hara toropong kapa setsheng sa monga sona**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ho beha tente sebakeng sa motho kapa toropong ya boholo le ha e le bofe ho ka ho biletsa mahlo ho sa hlokahale."" This means setting up a tent in a public or populated area can attract unwanted attention.  The question asks what car campers want to avoid if they want to stay under the radar, and avoiding attention is key.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage suggests *any* type of vehicle (van, SUV, sedan, wagon) can be used for car camping.
*   **B:** Taking a long trip is *what* car campers do; it's not something they avoid.
*   **D:** The passage says that car campers are often *familiar* with their vehicles, not unfamiliar.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang ya ahileng botjha toropo ya Casablanca lekgetlo la bobedi?","The correct answer is **D: Morena wa naha ya Morocco**.

The text states: ""Mmusi wa Morocco o hahile botjha toropo e le Daru I-Badya mme e filwe lebitso la Casablanca ke bahwebi ba Spain ba qadileng dibaka tsa kgwebo moo.""  This directly indicates the Moroccan ruler rebuilt the city. While Spanish traders *named* it Casablanca, they didn't rebuild it.



"
Ke mang ya lahlileng toropo ya moraorao ya Casablanca kamora koduwa ya tlholeho?,"The correct answer is **B: Mapotoketsi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mapotoketsi a e thubile mme ba e haha hape ka tlase ha lebitso la Casa Branca, hore fela ba e tlohele ka moraho ha tshisinyeho ka 1755."" This directly translates to ""The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 disaster.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baroma:** The text says the Romans *used* Anfa (Casablanca's old name), but doesn't say they abandoned it after a disaster.
*   **C: Batho ba Spain:** The Spanish *named* Casablanca, but didn't abandon a previously rebuilt city.
*   **D: Bafoneshia:** The Phoenicians were among the early settlers but not mentioned in relation to abandoning the city after the disaster.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, toropo ya Sintra e ile ya tuma jwang ho baditjhaba?","The correct answer is **C: Maikutlwo a matle ka yona a Lord Bryon**.

The passage states: ""...e ileng ya etswa hore e tume ho batho ba dinaha tse ding ka moraho ha tlaleho entle haholo ya bokgabane ba yona e tlalehilweng ke Lord Byron."" This means Sintra became famous internationally after Lord Byron wrote a very positive report about its beauty.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cabo da Roca** - Cabo da Roca is a place you can *reach* from Sintra, not the reason it became famous.
*   **B: Ho itlhaisa hwa Maria** - This refers to the Fatima sanctuary, which is *near* Sintra, not the reason Sintra became famous.
*   **D: Nalane ya yona e hlabosang** - The passage doesn't mention a ""fascinating history"" as the reason for its fame.



"
Ke eng e sa amohelweng ke naha ya Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: Rephaboliki e ntjha**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Le ha ho le jwalo, ha ho na naha e thehilweng - esita le Armenia - e e amohelang ka se mmuso"" (However, no country - not even Armenia - recognizes the new government). This directly refers to the newly formed republic in Nagorno-Karabakh.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hlwahlwa ya Nagorno-Karabakh:** The passage describes a conflict *over* Nagorno-Karabakh, not that Armenia doesn't accept its existence.
*   **B: Ntwa khahlanong le morabe wa Azeris:** While there was fighting, Armenia's lack of recognition isn't about the conflict itself, but about the resulting republic.
*   **C: Dikhohlano tsa dipolomate tsa morabe wa Azerbaijan:** The passage mentions political disputes, but the specific issue is Armenia's non-recognition of the new republic.



"
Keng eng e tswelang pele ho thunthetsa dikamano dipakeng tsa Azerbaijan le Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: Sebaka sa Nagorno-Karabakh**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""disputes over the area continue to strain relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan."" This refers directly to the ongoing political conflict surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Batho ba Armenia ba dulang Azerbaijan** - While the presence of Armenians in Azerbaijan is *part* of the conflict, it's not the overarching issue straining relations.
*   **B: Ntwa ya 1994** - The 1994 war is the *cause* of the current situation, but the *ongoing disputes* are what continue to strain relations.
*   **C: Dingangisano tsa dipolomate** - Diplomatic disagreements are a *result* of the conflict, not the root cause straining relations.



"
"Ha o tsamaya ka tekesi ho ya Charlotte, ke eng e ka eketsang ditjeo?","The correct answer is **B: Ho ba le baeti ba bararo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ho na le tefo e eketsehileng ha ho na le bapalami ba fetang 2, kahoo kgetho ena e ka bitsa haholo ho sa hlokahale."" This directly translates to ""There is an extra fee when there are more than 2 passengers, so this option can become unnecessarily expensive.""

Therefore, having three passengers (more than two) will increase the cost of a taxi ride in Charlotte.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho dula sebakeng se seng (Staying in one place):** The passage doesn't mention anything about location affecting taxi costs.
*   **C: Ho ya qalong ya toropo (Going to the city center):** While distance might affect cost, the passage specifically mentions *number of passengers* as the factor for an extra fee.
*   **D: Ho etsa malapa a ikutlwe a amohelehile (Making families feel welcome):** This is a general positive aspect of Charlotte mentioned in the passage, but not related to taxi fares."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng ntho e nkuwang e se hantle ya ho dula sebakeng sa Charlotte le bana?","The correct answer is **B: Ho tsamaya ka tekesi**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ditekisi ha di sebediswe hangata ke malapa ka Charlotte, le hoja di ka sebediswa maemong a itseng. Ho na le tefo e eketsehileng ha ho na le bapalami ba fetang 2, kahoo kgetho ena e ka bitsa haholo ho sa hlokahale."" This clearly indicates that taxis are considered a disadvantage when travelling with children in Charlotte because of the extra cost.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ditjeo tsa matlo:** The passage highlights Charlotte having *many* high-quality things for families, not high costs of housing.
*   **C: Baahi ba hlahang dibakeng tse ding:** The passage says people *move* to Charlotte because it's family-friendly, not that this is a negative.
*   **D: Ho leka ho natefelwa ke toropo:** The passage states that visitors *easily* enjoy the city with children, implying it is not difficult."
"Pele batho ba Spain ba fihla, ke mang a neng a laola karolo e leboya ya naha ya Chile?","The correct answer is **D: Incas**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Chile e ka leboya e ne e le tlaase ha puso ya Inca ha matswallwa a Araucania (Mapuche) a ntse a dula Chile e bohareng le e ka borwa.""  This directly translates to ""Northern Chile was under the Inca empire when the Araucanians (Mapuche) lived in central and southern Chile.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mapuche:** The text says they lived in the *central and southern* parts, not the north.
*   **B: MaAmerika:** This is too broad of a term. The text specifies the Inca.
*   **C: MaAraukania:** Araucania is another name for the Mapuche people and their territory; they didn't *rule* northern Chile.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latenalg, ke ntho efe e sa etsahalang ka selemo sa 1810?","The correct answer is **B: Chile e ile ya hlola batho ba Spain**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Le hoja Chile e patlaladitse ho Ikemela ka 1810 (hare ha dintwa tsa Napoleon tse siileng Spain e se na mmuso o moholo dilemo tse mmalwa), tlholo e matla kgahlanong le batho ba Spain ha ya ka ya etsahala ho fihlela ka 1818.""  This directly translates to: ""Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (during the Napoleonic Wars which left Spain without a strong government for several years), a decisive victory against the Spanish did not occur until 1818.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho ne ho se na mmuso o moholo** - The passage says the Napoleonic Wars *left* Spain without a strong government, not that this was the case *in* 1810 specifically.
*   **C: Dintwa tsa Napoli di ne di lwanwa** - The passage refers to the Napoleonic Wars, but doesn't say they were being fought *in* 1810.
*   **D: Chile e ile ya phatlalatsa boipuso** - The passage explicitly states Chile *declared* independence in 1810.



"
Batho ba ka fihla jwang metseng e hole ya Liguria?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka terene kapa sekepe**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ditselana, diterene le dikepe di hokahanya metsana, mme dikoloi ha di kgone ho fihla ho tsona di tswa ka ntle."" This directly translates to ""Paths, trains and boats connect the towns, and cars cannot reach them from the outside.""

Therefore, you can get to the Cinque Terre towns by train or boat.



"
Lentsoe lee ‘Cinque Terre’ la Setadiana le bolelang?,"The correct answer is **A: Metse e mehlano**.

The text states ""Cinque Terre, e bolelang Dinaha tse Hlano..."" which directly translates to ""Cinque Terre, meaning Five Lands/Towns"".  ""Metse"" means towns, and ""hlano"" means five.
"
"Ho latela seratswana see, ke mofuta ofe wa dibutsu o loketseng ha ho rella?","The correct answer is **B: Dibutsu tse kentsweng dintho tse thibelang ho rella**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ho na le disebediswa tsa dikonopo tse eketswang bakeng sa maemo a thellang, tse loketseng dieta tse ngata le dibutsi, bakeng sa direthe le kapa direthe le bohato."" This directly refers to boots *with additions to prevent slipping*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dibutsu tse lirethe li motopo** - The passage doesn't mention the material of the boots, only their features.
*   **C: Dieta tse direthe di kgolo** - The passage discusses the soles/tread of the boots, not the size of the boots themselves.
*   **D: Dieta tse se nang 1/5 intjhi ka phetene ya botebo** - The passage specifically states the tread should be *at least* 5mm (1/5 inch) deep, making this incorrect.



"
Ho tse latelang ke eng e thusang hore ho se ke hwa thella tseleng nakong ya mariha?,"The correct answer is **A: Letswai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lehlabathe, lehlohlojane kapa letswai (calcium chloride) hangata le hasana ditseleng kapa litselelaneng ho ntlafatsa tshubuhlellano."" This means calcium chloride (letswai) is used to *improve traction* and therefore help prevent slipping on icy roads.

While lehlohlojane and lehlabathe are mentioned, letswai is specifically identified as a substance used to improve grip in icy conditions. Metsi (water) would actually *cause* more ice and slippage.



"
Ke efe tshwano e nepahetseng dipakeng tsa Hawaii le Dihlekehleke tsa Cook?,"The correct answer is **C: Di nakong e le nngwe**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Cook Islands are sometimes called “Hawaii ka tlaase” and that they are similar in size to Hawaii. This implies a comparison in time – that the Cook Islands are like Hawaii *before* it was developed into a major tourist destination.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bobedi di na le dihotele tse kgolo tse ngata** - The passage specifically says the Cook Islands *don't* have large resort hotels, unlike developed Hawaii.
*   **B: Bobedi ha di na boemo** - This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Bobedi ha di na ditoropo** - The passage states the Cook Islands don’t have towns, but doesn't say anything about Hawaii’s towns or cities.



"
Ke eng e sa hlaloseng ka ho nepahala Dihlekehleke tsa Cook moo?,"The correct answer is **A: Di nyane ho Hawaii**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Le hoja e le nyenyane, e hopotsa baeti ba hodileng ka Hawaii pele e emiswa jwaloka mmuso..."". This directly indicates that the Cook Islands *are* smaller than Hawaii. The phrase implies a comparison where the Cook Islands are the less substantial version of Hawaii.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ke dihlopha tsa dihlekehleke:** The passage clearly states ""Ke sehlopha sa dihlekehleke sa dihlekehleke tse 15..."" - this is accurate.
*   **C: Ditoropo tsa mantlha ke Rarotonga le Aitutaki:** The text says, ""Tse ka sehloohong ke Rarotonga le Aitutaki"" – this is accurate.
*   **D: Naha e sehlekehlekeng e sebedisa nako e tshwanang le ya Hawaii:** The passage states ""Ka nako ya sebaka e tswhanang le ya Hawaii"" – this is accurate.



"
Ke dife diteishene tsa bolebedi tse fanang ka mefuta e mmedi ya bodulo?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

The text states: ""Sirena is the only ranger station offering lodging and cooked food above the camps."" This means Sirena is the only station providing both accommodation *and* food. The other stations only offer campsites without food services."
"Ho latela seratswana see, ke kae moo o ka bolokang tumello ya ho paka haeba o batla ho sebedisa tjhelete eseng mokitlane?","The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""You must have a reservation to stay overnight at Sirena. Sirena is the only ranger station offering lodging and cooked meals above the camps.""  This implies you need a reservation (permission) to stay at Sirena, and it's the only place with lodging. The question asks where you can *book* a permission if you don't want to use a credit card.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Puerto Jiménez:** You can get permits directly at the ranger station in Puerto Jiménez, *but* they don't accept credit cards.
* **C: CafeNet El Sol:** CafeNet El Sol offers a reservation *service* for a fee, but Sirena is where the actual permission to stay is needed.
* **D: La Leona:**  La Leona only offers campsites without meal service.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mofuta ofe wa ho theledisa o etswang moepeng?","The correct answer is **D: Ho theledisa ka mokokotlo**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Nahana ka tsela ya ho thellisa lehlweng jwaloka o tshwanang le tsela ya ho hahlaula naha...empa ke ka sewelo haholo feela o ka fumanang lebelo la ho thellisa lehlweng dibakeng tse sa tlwaelehang ntle le **mokotla o imelang ditseleng tse lokisitsweng**.""  This directly refers to using a sled/mokotla for traversing the terrain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho theledisa ka maoto** - While walking is *involved* in some aspects, the passage focuses on using a sled to cover distance efficiently.
* **B: Ho theledisa dibakeng tse kotsi** - The passage mentions challenging terrain, but doesn't define the activity *as* traversing dangerous areas.
* **C: Setaele sa Alpine** -  Alpine style is *mentioned* as a related activity, but it's not the type of sledding being discussed in the passage.



"
"Ho latela seratswana see, ke eng e ka thusang ba theledisang dibakeng tse kotsi ho fihlela lebelo le hodimo?","The correct answer is **D: Ditsela tse hlophisitsweng tsa ho thelledisa lehlweng**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...o ka fumanang lebelo la ho thellisa lehlweng dibakeng tse sa tlwaelehang ntle le **mokotla o imelang ditseleng tse lokisitsweng**."" This directly connects having prepared routes/paths (ditsela tse hlophisitsweng) with achieving higher speeds in challenging terrain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dieta tse thata (Strong diet):** The text doesn't mention diet at all.
* **B: Mokotla o boima o jarwang ka mahetleng (Heavy backpack carried on shoulders):** The text implies a *helpful* pack is one *designed for prepared paths*, not a heavy, burdensome one.
* **C: Maemong a matle (Good conditions):** While good conditions help, the text focuses on how to achieve speed *despite* challenging conditions with the aid of prepared paths.



"
Baeti ba nang le ho tshoha ho dula le ba ditso tse ding ba kopana le mathata afe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho ikamahanya le ditlwaelo tsa sebaka se setjha** (Adjusting to the customs of a new place).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the difficulty of readjusting to *old* customs *after* experiencing *new* ones.** It highlights how people get used to new ways of doing things when traveling or living elsewhere, and then struggle to revert to their original habits upon returning home. This is directly related to adjusting to a new environment (the one they left) after being accustomed to a different one.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hoba le mamello le kutlwisiso** (Having patience and understanding) - While the passage *mentions* the need for patience *towards* newcomers, it's not the *problem* faced by the travelers themselves.
* **C: Ho etela mose** (Visiting abroad) - This is the *cause* of the problem, not the problem itself.
* **D: Ho ikamahanya le ditwaelo tsa moo ba tswang** (Adjusting to the customs of where they come from) - This is the *opposite* of the problem. The passage describes difficulty readjusting *to* where they come from.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tshoha ho dula le batho ba ditso tse ding ho ka baka bothata ho moeti ya jwang?","The correct answer is **A: Baeti ba kopanang le ditlwaelo tse mpe tse tshosang**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses the difficulty of readjusting to one's original customs after experiencing new ones. It highlights that returning ""home"" after being away (like at sea) means you've adopted new ways and may have *discarded* old ones.  The passage implies that encountering different, potentially unsettling, customs can make it hard for a traveler to settle back in.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Baeti ba ileng ba tlwaela ho dula mose ho mawatle kapele:** The passage says they *adapt* to life at sea, but the problem is readjusting *back* from that.
* **C: Baeti ba qetang ho nyalana:** This is irrelevant to the passage.
* **D: Baeti ba hlokang mamello:** The passage actually points out that *others* need patience and understanding *for* the returning travelers, not that the travelers themselves lack patience.



"
Ke eng eo batho ba sa lokeleng ho e etsa ha ba kopana le phoofolo e bitswang moose?,"The correct answer is **B: Ho atamela butle-butle**.

Here's why:

The passage states that people shouldn't underestimate moose and that approaching them can be dangerous.  ""Ho atamela"" means ""to approach."" The passage warns against approaching *too* closely because moose will defend themselves if they feel threatened. Therefore, approaching slowly (butle-butle) is the action people should *avoid*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho iphapanyetsa boteng ba yona** (to challenge its dominance) - The passage doesn't mention anything about challenging a moose.
*   **C: Ho fokotsa kotsi eo ba ka nnang ba e baka** (to reduce the risk they might cause) - This is a good idea in general, but isn't what the passage directly warns against.
*   **D: Ho di shebela hole** (to watch them from a distance) - This is a *safe* thing to do, not something to avoid.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng eseng nnete ka phoofolo e bitswang moose?","The correct answer is **A: Ke phoofolo e hlaha haholo** (It is a very shy animal).

Here's why:

* **The passage states moose *don't* usually bother people.** They only defend themselves when threatened.  This contradicts the idea that they are very shy and avoid contact.
* **B: Ka nako e nngwe ha di bonahale di tshosa** (Sometimes they appear frightening) - The passage says people don't *see* them as dangerous, which implies they *can* appear large and potentially intimidating.
* **C: Di ka qalwa ke batho ba pela tsona haholo** (They can be provoked by people who approach them too closely) - The passage directly states people can get too close and put themselves in danger.
* **D: Di tla itshiretsa ha ho hlokahala** (They will defend themselves when necessary) - The passage explicitly states this.

Therefore, the only statement that is *not* supported by the passage is that moose are very shy."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e ka bang kotsi ho batsamai ba lehwatateng?","The correct answer is **B: Ho bona seriti se kang metsi empa e se ona**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that mirages ""can be dangerous if the traveler follows the shimmering illusion, depleting the energy of what little water they have left."" This means seeing something that *looks* like water but isn't water is a direct danger to travelers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the passage mentions being cold is dangerous, it doesn't say lack of warm clothes is *the* danger specifically for travelers.
*   **C:** The passage doesn't mention wasting time looking at dunes.
*   **D:** The passage states that depleting water comes from *following* the mirage, not from ""wasting water looking at it.""



"
Ke eng e sa bolelwang e le tshoso ho baeti ba lehwatata?,"The correct answer is **B: ho phatshima ho kang metsi**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically warns about ""ho phatsima ho kang metsi"" (mirages) and the danger of following them, thinking they are water. This is a direct hazard to hikers that the text highlights as potentially dangerous.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kgaello ya metsi (Lack of water):** While dehydration is a hiking hazard, the passage doesn't mention a lack of water as a deceiving element.
*   **C: Bokudi bo bakwang ke bho hatsela nako e telele (Fatigue caused by long exertion):** The text doesn't focus on fatigue.
*   **D: Ho tjheswa ke letsatsi (Sunburn):** The passage mentions cold and hypothermia, not sunburn.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mofuta ofe wa batho o ileng wa angwa ke ho fihla ha bafuputsi?","The correct answer is **C: Mataíno**.

The passage states: ""The island was first inhabited by the Taínos and Caribes... After the arrival of European explorers, the Taíno people were drastically reduced by Spanish colonizers.""  It explicitly says the Taíno population was greatly diminished due to the arrival of Europeans.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, setjhaba sa Caribe se ne se bua puo efe?","The correct answer is **D: Searawakan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Macaribe e ne e le batho ba puo ya Arawakan ba fihlileng nakong ya 10,000 BCE."" This directly states the Caribe people spoke the Arawakan language.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sehaiti** - Haiti is the country that shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic, but the passage doesn't mention the Caribe people speaking Haitian.
*   **B: Sepanishe** - Spanish came with the colonizers, not the original Caribe inhabitants.
*   **C: Sekgowa** - This language isn't mentioned in the text.



"
Ke mang ya ka tlotlwang ka ho tumisa ho theledisa e le papadi ya boithabiso?,"The correct answer is **B: Setjhaba sa Norwegian**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ka 1861 sehlopha sa ho qala sa ho thellisa lehlwa sa boithabiso se ile sa bulwa ke batho ba Norway"". This directly credits the Norwegian people with establishing skiing as a recreational activity.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho theledisa ho elelletswe neng hore ke papadi?","The correct answer is **D: Dilemong tsa lekholo ba bo17**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ho thellisa lehlweng o theosa le maralla ke papadi e tlohang morao kwana lekgolong la bo17 la dilemo..."" This directly translates to ""Skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dilemong tsa lekholo la bo18** - While skiing continued to develop in the 18th century, the text states its *origins* are in the 17th.
*   **B: Ka 5000 BC** - This refers to the earliest *depictions* of people on skis, not the start of skiing as a sport/recreation.
*   **C: 1861** - This is when the first recreational ski club was founded, *not* when skiing began as a pastime.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke efe ho tse latelang e amahangwang le sehlekehleke se seholo ka ho fetisisa botjhabela ho lebopo la Afrika?","The correct answer is **B: Tumelo ya Mamoseleme (The belief of Muslims)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states ""Madagascar ke yona e kgolo ka ho kgetheka, mme ke kontinente ka boyona ha ho tla bophelong ba naheng... Maarabia a tlisitse hape Boislamo dinaheng, mme Bacomoro le Bamayotte ba bo rata haholo."" This directly links the largest island (Madagascar) to the arrival and strong adoption of Islam.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tshusumetso ya ya Europa (European influence)** - While the passage mentions European influence, it doesn't specifically tie it to the *largest* island.
*   **C: Diphoofolo tse hlaha (Animal life)** - The passage does not discuss the animal life of the islands.
*   **D: Dibaka tsa boikgathollo tsa boemo bo hodimo (High-end resort locations)** - This describes smaller islands, not the largest one.



"
Ke eng eo e seng tshobotsi ya dihlekehleke tse nyane ka Afrika Botjhabela? ,"The correct answer is **B: Dibaka tse ngata tsa boikgathollo tsa boemo bo hodimo**.

Here's why:

The text states that many of the smaller islands are ""known as luxury coastal resorts."" This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tsela e kopanyang naha ya Fora (A connection to France):** While the text mentions some islands are associated with France, it doesn't define this as a characteristic of *all* the smaller islands.
*   **C: Seriti se setle sa diphoofolo tse hlaha (A good range of wildlife):** The text doesn't mention anything about the wildlife of these islands.
*   **D: Boipuso ho tloha ho ditjhaba tse ding (Independence from other nations):** The text states that some are independent, but others are linked to France, so independence isn't a universal characteristic.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, Paseka e ketekwa jwang, haholo ke dikereke tsa setso?","The correct answer is **B: Ho tsamaisa mokete wa tebelo ya bosiu ba Moqebelo**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that many ancient churches traditionally held a vigil (Ho se Robala) on Holy Saturday night (bosiu ba Moqebelo) during Easter weekend, with gatherings often taking place *throughout the night* to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.  This vigil is the key element of how the passage describes Easter being celebrated, particularly in older churches.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho phethahatsa moetlo wa ho potlakisa thari** - The passage doesn't mention anything about this.
*   **C: Ketekelo ya nako ya selemo ya Kereke** - While Easter *is* a seasonal celebration, the passage focuses on the *specific practice* of the vigil.
*   **D: Ho shebella letsatsi ha le tjhaba** -  The passage mentions seeing the sunrise, but as a result of being awake during the vigil - it isn't the central celebration itself.



"
"Ele ho qoba tse ding tsa dipehelo tsa ho kena naheng ya Eucador, Moahi wa naha ya Cuba o lokela ho ba le eng pele?","The correct answer is **B: Lengolo la memo la molao**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ecuador e hloka hore baahi ba Cuba ba fumane lengolo la memo pele ba kena Ecuador..."" (Ecuador requires Cuban citizens to obtain a memo letter before entering Ecuador...). This is the key requirement to avoid entry issues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bukana ya ho eta e nakong ya dikhoedi tse 6 ka mora matsatsi a leeto** - While a passport valid for 6 months is needed, the passage doesn't mention a visa booklet.
*   **C: Tekete ya ho ya le ho kgutla e le ho paka bolele ba nako ya leeto** - A return ticket *is* required, but the memo letter is the primary document to avoid issues.
*   **D: Karete e tala ya Amerika** - A US green card holder needs to visit the Ecuadorian consulate to *qualify for the memo letter*, but the green card itself isn't the requirement for entry.



"
Dipehelo tsa ho etela Ecuador ha di bolele eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Ho boloka lenane le lekaneng la batho ba kenang naheng eo** (To maintain an orderly flow of travel between the two countries).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the memo requirement is ""made to provide an orderly flow of travel between the two countries."" This directly relates to managing and controlling the number of people entering Ecuador.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't mention lowering the number of tourists. It's about *managing* the flow, not necessarily reducing it.
*   **C:** While a return ticket does indicate the planned length of stay, the memo itself isn't directly about verifying that length.
*   **D:** Passport validity and return tickets are standard travel requirements, but the memo is a specific requirement *in addition* to these, targeting Cuban citizens.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke efe e ditjeo di boima naheng tse ding ho feta naheng ya lehae?","The correct answer is **B: Dikhalase tsa mahlo tsa boemo bo hodimo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that high-quality glasses ""can be expensive in those places, even more expensive than at home.""  This directly answers the question of what is more expensive in other countries.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho hlahloba mahlo (Eye exams):** The passage suggests eye exams are *cheaper* in countries with lower operating costs.
*   **C: Inshorense ya mahlo (Eye insurance):** The passage doesn't compare the cost of eye insurance. It only mentions insurance covering costs at home.
*   **D: Dikhalase tsa mahlo tse se nang lebitso (No-name glasses):** The passage points out that these might be fake, or the real ones might be cheap, implying they are *not* more expensive.



"
Bokotsi ba ho reka dikhalase tsa mahlo tsa boemo bo hodimo naheng e nngwe e ka ba bofeng?,"The most accurate answer based on the provided text is **D: E ka nna ya ba inshorese e ka se di lefelle.**

Here's why:

* The text specifically mentions the potential issue of insurance *not* covering the costs of glasses purchased abroad, especially if they are higher quality.  It highlights the risk of those glasses costing *more* than at home even with a prescription.

Let's look at why the other options aren't the best fit:

* **A: Tlhatlhobo e nngwe ya mahlo e ka nna ya hlokahala:** While another eye exam *might* be needed, the passage doesn't primarily focus on this. It's a secondary concern.
* **B: Di ka nna tsa se sebetse diforeiming tse ding:** The passage *does* mention potentially counterfeit frames, but this is just one of two potential issues.  The main issue is cost and insurance.
* **C: E ka nna ya ba ke tsa bohata:** The text doesn't suggest the glasses are inherently fake, just that there's a risk of *receiving* a fake. The core issue discussed is financial.



"
"Ho latela tshebediso ya tjhelete sebakeng sa Falkland, ho tse latelang, ke polelo efe eo eleng mafosisa?","The correct answer is **A: Dihlekehleke tse thoko le ditoropo di amohela feela dikarete tsa mokitlane le diponto tsa Borithane.**

Here's why:

*   The text states that in remote areas, credit cards are *not* widely accepted, but British pounds and US dollars *are* accepted. So, the statement that they only accept international cards and British pounds is false.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **B: Stanely ke sona sebaka feela se amohelang ditolara tsa Amerika:** The text says US dollars are *generally* accepted, and the only bank to exchange currency is in Stanley. This implies Stanley is where you're most likely to use/exchange US dollars.
*   **C: Diponto tsa Falkland di lokela ho tjhentjhwa ka mora ho tloha dihlekehlekeng:** The text strongly advises exchanging Falkland Islands pounds *before* leaving the islands, as it's ""almost impossible"" to exchange them outside of the islands.
*   **D: Ntle le diponto tsa Falkland, diponto tsa Borithane ke yona tjhelete e sebediswang haholo:** The text states that Falkland Islands pounds are equivalent to British pounds and that British pounds are ""usually accepted everywhere"". This suggests British pounds are the main currency.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ha motho a etela Falklands a tloha Amerika, ke hokae moo mofuta wa ho patala ntle le karete ya mokitlane, o ka bang le thuso?","The correct answer is **A: Lebenkeleng la FIC West**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Diponto tsa Britain ka ho tlwaelehileng di tla amohelwa kae kapa kae dihlekehlekeng le di dolara tsa United States le tsona hangata dia amohelwa. ... le hoja tjhelete ya ho reka ya Britain le United Staes e ka nkuwa; botsa beng ba moo ho sa ntse ho na le nako ho fumana hore ke tsela efe ya ho lefa e amohelwang. E batla e le ntho e sa etsahaleng ho fetola tjhelete ya Falklands kantle ho dihlekehleke, kahoo fetola tjhelete pele o tsamaya dihlekehlekeng.""  It also explicitly mentions that currency can be exchanged at ""bankeng eo e leng yona feela sehlekehlekeng e leng Stanley ka nqane ha lebenkele la FIC West.""

Since the question asks about a form of payment *besides* a credit card that would be helpful for someone from America, and US dollars are often accepted, the option that gives a place to exchange USD to FKP is the most helpful.



"
Ke mokete ofe o sa amahangweng le diketekelo tsa tempele?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho hlaha hwa tlou**.

Here's why:

The passage states that temple festivals are connected to:

*   Temple commemorations (Sehopotso sa tempele)
*   The birthday of the ruling deity (Letsatsi la tswalo la modingwana)
*   Significant events related to the temple (Diketsahalo tsa bohlokwa tse amang tempele)

It also *describes* the presence of decorated elephants (ho hlaha hwa tlou) *at* the festivals, but doesn't say the emergence of an elephant is *why* a festival is held. It's a feature of the festivals, not the reason for them.
"
Ditlou tse kgabisitsweng di ka bonwa hokae?,"The correct answer is **C: Mekolokong e halalelang ka nako ya mekete ya ditempele/Mekolokong e halalelang nakong ya mekete ya ditemmpele**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""...mokolokolo wa ka mehla wa ditlou tse kgabisitsweng..."" which translates to ""...a constant procession of decorated elephants..."".  This procession happens *during* temple festivals. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hohle ho tloha mafelong a Pudungwana ho fihlela mahareng a Motsheanong** - While elephants are present in these areas, the text doesn't indicate that's where they're *specifically* seen, but rather in the context of the festivals.
* **B: Ka hara ditempele** - Elephants wouldn't typically be *inside* the temple itself.
* **D: Diterateng tsa Kerala** - While Kerala is the location, it's the festivals and processions that are the key point, not just seeing them on the streets.

"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke mokhwa ofe o ka sehloohong wa ho boloka tjhelete diteketeng tsa boemo bo hodimo e leng maemo a pele le maemo a bobedi a phahameng ka sefofaneng?","The correct answer is **A: Ho tswa ditjeong tsa khampani ya hao** (Getting your company to pay).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Tsela e totobetseng ya ho fofa ka maemo a pele kapa ka maemo a kgwebo ke ho ntsha bokgothokgotho ba tjhelete bakeng sa monyetla (kapa, ho molemo le ho feta, ke hore khamphani ya hao e o etsetse).""  This translates to ""The obvious way to fly in first or business class is to expense the opportunity (or, even better, have your company pay for it).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ho lefella tekete ya boemo bo hodimo ba pele ho feta boemo bo hodimo ba bobedi** (Paying more for a first-class ticket than a business-class ticket): The passage states first class is *much* more expensive than business class, not just more expensive.
* **C: Ho lefella sefofane se o siyang tseleng sa tekete ya boemo bo hodimo ba pele** (Paying a plane to drop you off on the way for a first-class ticket): This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Ho fumana dinyehlisetso** (Getting upgrades): The passage says you should *avoid* asking for business or first-class upgrades on flights from A to B because they are so expensive.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng seo e ka bang tshenyo ya nako ho shebana le sona nakong ya ho lefella ditekete tsa maemo a fapaneng?","The correct answer is **C: Dinyehlisetso**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states ""Ha re bua feela, ha ho hlokahale ho kopa dinyehlisetso tsa kgwebo kapa tsa ditulo tsa maemo a pele difofaneng tsa ho tloha ho A ho ya ho B."" This means requesting upgrades (dinyehlisetso) is a waste of time when trying to pay for different class seats.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sefofane se fihlisang motho sebakeng seo a yang ho sona:** This is simply the function of an airplane and isn't related to the passage's argument about paying for seat upgrades.
*   **B: Sebaka sa maemo a bobedi a hodimo ka sefofaneng:** The passage focuses on the extra cost of *upgrading* to first class, not simply flying in business class.
*   **D: Sebaka sa maemo a pele a hodimo ka sefofaneng:** The passage *mentions* first class but argues that paying extra for it (or trying to get an upgrade to it) is not worth the cost.



"
Ke eng e sa hlokeng ho eketswa ha motho a lekanya ditjeo tsa Afrika le ho ya mafatsheng a mang?,"The correct answer is **A: Ditjeo tse ding tsa visa ho etela dibaka tse kantle ho Afrika** (Additional visa costs to visit places outside of Africa).

Here's why:

The text specifically states to *include* extra visa costs for destinations *outside* of Africa when comparing total travel costs. This implies that these costs are often forgotten or not initially considered, and are therefore important to add.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ditjeo tsa lekhetho la ho tloha Afrika** (Tax costs from leaving Africa): The text doesn't mention needing to calculate departure taxes specifically.
* **C: Ditjeo tsa visa ya Afrika** (Visa costs for Africa): The text specifically says to include visa costs, so it's not something *not* to add.
* **D: Ditjeo tsa ho tloha boemafofane bakeng sa dibaka tse ka ntle ho Afrika** (Airport fees for places outside of Africa): The text does mention airport fees as something to consider, so it's not something *not* to add.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng seo mabenkele a qalellang ho fana ka sona ka mekgwa e fapaneng?","The correct answer is **B: Difuthumatsi tsa dijo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Tse ding di fana ka onto ya microwave kapa ditsela tse ding tsa ho futhumatsa dijo."" This directly translates to ""...Others provide a microwave or other ways to heat food.""  This means supermarkets are offering ways to heat/reheat food, which are ""difuthumatsi tsa dijo"" (food warmers/heating options).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dijo tse phehilweng** (Prepared foods) - While the passage mentions prepared foods are available, it doesn't say supermarkets *offer* them, only that a large portion of prepared food comes *from* supermarkets.
*   **C: Dibaka tsa ho jella sebakeng seo** (Eating areas) - The passage mentions these exist, but states they are often illegal and not a standard offering.
*   **D: Ditjeo tse bobebe** (Lower prices) - The passage mentions lower prices in some eating areas, but that's not what the supermarkets themselves are offering."
Ke ntho efe e khahlang mabenkeleng e ka khahlang moreki ya rekang dijo tse phehilweng?,"The correct answer is **A: Dibaka tsa ho jella sebakeng seo** (Eating areas in the store).

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions that some supermarkets have ""bonnyane sebaka se le seng sa ho jela"" (at least one eating area), often with lower prices. This is presented as something that attracts customers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Khetho e tlase ya dintho tse fapaneng** (Lower selection of items): The passage says choices are *limited* in supermarkets, not that this attracts customers.
* **C: Dijo tse sa phehwang** (Uncooked food): The passage focuses on *prepared* foods.
* **D: Sefuthumatsi sa dijo** (Food warmers): While mentioned, it's a feature *of* the prepared foods, not a draw in itself.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke eng e ke keng ya utluwa ke batho ba buang Sefora ba dinaha tsa Belgium le Switzerland?","The correct answer is **A: Mokgwa o tlwaelehileng wa Sefora wa ho ngola dipalo**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that the numbering system (how numbers are written) in French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland has *distinct differences* compared to French spoken in France. However, it also notes that speakers from Belgium and Switzerland learn standard French in school, allowing them to understand even if the numbering system differs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mantswe a sa tlwaelehang a Sefora:** The passage implies that unusual words wouldn't be a significant barrier.
* **C: Mekgwa e meng ya ho bitsa mantswe a Sefora:**  The passage says pronunciation differences are *slight*.
* **D: Boholo ba Sefora se buuwang Fora:** The passage indicates they can understand French from France because they learn standard French.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke eng e sa tshwaneng naheng ya Fora jwalo ka dinaheng tsa Belgium le Switzerland?","The correct answer is **B: Mokhwa wa ho ngola dipalo** (The way of writing numbers).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: *""Ka ho kgetheha, tsamaiso ya dinomoro ka Sefora sa Belgium le Switzerland ditshobotsi tse ikgethang tse itseng tse fapaneng le Sefora se buuwang Fora...""* which translates to *""In particular, the number system in French in Belgium and Switzerland has certain unique characteristics that differ from the French spoken in France...""*

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho bitswa hwa mantswe kaofela** (The pronunciation of all words) - The passage states pronunciation is *slightly* different, not fundamentally different.
* **C: Sefora se tlwaehileng se rutwang dikolong** (The standard French taught in schools) -  The passage says everyone in Belgium and Switzerland learns standard French in school, meaning this is *the same*.
* **D: Mopeleto wa a mang a mantswe a Sefora** (The spelling of some French words) - The passage only mentions slight differences in pronunciation, not spelling.



"
Ke maemong afe ao o ke keng wa fuwa tekete ya batho ba shwelletsweng?,"The correct answer is **A: Ha o tsamaya ka sefofane sa WestJet**.

Here's why:

The passage states that several airlines *offer* bereavement fares, and then specifically lists Air Canada, Delta, Lufthansa (from US/Canada), and **WestJet**.  However, it also says you *must* make arrangements over the phone directly with the airline. The implication is that WestJet is less likely to offer the fare (or has different rules) given it's the only one singled out in relation to making arrangements. The other options mention airlines that *do* offer the fares, or a specific route for Lufthansa which does offer the fare.

Therefore, travelling on WestJet is the most likely scenario where a bereavement fare wouldn't be offered.
"
Keng seo eleng nnete ka ditefiso tsa batho ba shweletsweng?,"The correct answer is **D: Di tlameha ho ngoliswa ka kotloloho le khamphani ka founu.**

The passage states: ""Memong ohle, o lokela ho etsa tokisetso ka mohala ka ho tobileng le sefofane."" This directly translates to needing to arrange everything directly with the airline by phone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di kenyeletsa ditjeo tsa ho ya lefung** - The passage doesn't mention funeral costs.
* **B: Di lokela ho lefellwa feela marang-rang a khampani ya difofane** - The passage doesn't specify *where* payment happens, just that arrangements are made with the airline directly.
* **C: Di kenyeletsa le ditjeo tsa ho lefa motsotsong wa ho qetela** - This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
Ke neng re ka bonang ho sebesisa motjhini wa GPS ho loketse ho feta marang-rang a GPS?,"The correct answer is **B: Ha o na le bonnete hore o tla ba le kgokelo ya marang-rang**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that a smartphone GPS ""can be limited or not work"" if you don't have a data connection. This means a dedicated GPS device is more reliable when you're unsure about network access.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ha o leka ho boloka tjhelete:** While the passage mentions saving money, that's not the *primary* reason to choose a dedicated GPS. Reliability is more important.
*   **C: Ha o ya kantle ho sebaka:** The passage mentions using it *when travelling*, suggesting it's useful outside your usual area, but doesn't say dedicated GPS is *better* for this.
*   **D: Ha o sa batle ho hira motjhini:** This is about avoiding rental costs, not the practical benefits of a dedicated GPS.



"
Lebaka le sa nepahalang ka ho sebedisa marang-rang a GPS kgahlanong le motjhini wa GPS ke lefe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ke ho se hloke ho tshwenyeha ka kgokelo ya marang-rang**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Haeba o se na kgokahano ya datha founung ya hao kapa ha e sa fihlellehe, ho sebetsa ha yona ho ka lekanyetswa kapa ya se ke ya sebetsa.""  This means a key *drawback* of using a smartphone for GPS is reliance on a data connection.  The question asks for a *disadvantage* of using GPS on your phone *compared* to a dedicated GPS device. Dedicated GPS devices don't need a data connection to work.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ho boloka tjhelete** - This is presented as an *advantage* of using a smartphone GPS, not a disadvantage.
* **C: Ho qoba ho hira** - Similar to B, this is a benefit.
* **D: Ho se hloke ho reka dimmapa tse ntjha** - This is also an advantage.

"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e ka o fang tiisetse ya hore o palame sekepe se nepahetseng?","The correct answer is **C: Ho lefella ho ejente e sebetsanang le maeto a Galapagos**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Tiiseha hore moemedi eo o beheletsang sebaka ho yena ke setsebi sa Galapagos ya nang le tsebo ya dikepe tse fapa-fapaneng. Sena se tla netefatsa hore dithahasello tse tseng tsa hao le/kapa ditshitiso di tshwantshwa le sekepe se di tshwanetseng haholo."" This means using a Galapagos expert (agent) is the key to ensuring you get on the right ship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While traveling with similar interests is good, it doesn't *guarantee* the right ship.
*   **B:** Traveling during the low season may be cheaper, but doesn't ensure ship suitability.
*   **D:** Booking early increases your chances of getting a spot, but doesn't guarantee it's the *right* ship for *you*.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng ho tse latelang e sa sebedisweng e le leqheka la ho boloka baeti ho betjha?","The correct answer is **C: Dino tsa mahala**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dibaka tse ding di fana ka dino tse tahang ntle ho tefo."" (Some places offer free drinks.) It then directly connects this to keeping gamblers betting: ""Le ha ho le jwalo, botahwa bo baka ho se etse diqeto hantle, mme dipadi tse tlwaetseng ho betjha di tseba hantle bohlokwa ho dula di hlaphohetswe."" (However, intoxication leads to poor decisions, and seasoned gamblers know the importance of staying hydrated.)  Offering free drinks is explicitly used to keep people gambling.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bongata ba khanya ya tlholeho (Amount of artificial light):** The passage mentions windows are often small, but doesn't link light to keeping gamblers betting.
*   **B: Ho fumantshwa ditekete tsa mahala tsa konsarete (Free concert tickets):** The passage mentions entertainment, but not specifically free concert tickets.
*   **D: Ho hlokahala hwa tshupa-nako ya leboteng (Lack of a wall clock):** The passage states clocks are deliberately absent to disorient people, but it doesn't say this *helps* them gamble more, only that it makes it harder to leave.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng eo batho ba betjhang ba lokelang ho e qoba?","The correct answer is **A: Ho nwa haholo (Drinking too much)**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""...botahwa bo baka ho se etse diqeto hantle, mme dipadi tse tlwaetseng ho betjha di tseba hantle bohlokwa ho dula di hlaphohetswe."" This translates to ""...intoxication leads to poor decisions, and experienced gamblers know the importance of staying sober."" 

The passage directly warns against the dangers of being intoxicated while gambling. The other options are not mentioned as risks within the text.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke karolo dife tsa puo tse ngolwang ka tlhaku tse kgolo hara polelo?","The correct answer is **A: Maeetsi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...o dula o qala ka tlhaku e kgolo, le ha e le hare ha polelo. Ena ke tsela e bohlokwa ya ho etsa phapang pakeng tsa **maetsi** le disebediswa.""  This directly links capitalization within a sentence to proper nouns (maeetsi).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mareho (Verbs):** Verbs are not generally capitalized mid-sentence.
* **C: Dihlakisi (Adjectives):** Adjectives are also not generally capitalized mid-sentence.
* **D: Maeketsi (Adverbs):**  Adverbs do not require capitalization mid-sentence either.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho ngola mareho ka ditlhaku tse kgolo ho ka baka bothata bofe?","The correct answer is **C: Ho ngola**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...leha ho ngola ho rarahane ka tsela e itseng ka lebaka la ho batla ho fumana hore leetsi kapa lehlalosi le sebedisitse ka tsela e bonahatsang bohlokwa."" 

This translates to: ""...although writing can be cumbersome in a way because of having to find out that the noun or adjective used in a prominent way is important.""

This means using capitalization for all nouns can make the *process of writing* more difficult because you have to consciously identify and capitalize each noun.
"
Mahaeng a naha ya Malaysia lentswe “tloho” le bontshwa jwang?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho koba monwana wa bosupa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that in Malaysia, particularly among Malaysians in rural areas, showing the palm of the hand means ""come here"" – similar to a beckoning gesture used in some Western countries. This is described as akin to waving a finger toward oneself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ho tsoka letsoho** - The passage states this is generally a greeting (""hello"") in many parts of the world, but *not* its meaning in Malaysia.
*   **C: Ho tsokela letsoho hodimo-dimo** - The passage doesn't mention this.
*   **D: Ho tsitsinya menwana e fana ka modumo** - The passage doesn't mention this.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, lentswe “kgutla” le bontshwa jwang?","The correct answer is **C: Ho tsoka letsoho o le shebisa kantle**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a British traveler might see someone raising their hand, palm facing *away* from the person raising it, as a sign of waving goodbye.  This is how ""kgutla"" (goodbye) is demonstrated in that context.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho tsoka letsoho ole shebisa ka ho wena:** The passage says this is a greeting (""dumela"") in many parts of the world, and a signal for ""it's coming"" in Malaysia.
*   **B: Ho koba monwana wa bo supa:** This is mentioned as a similar gesture to the Malaysian ""it's coming"" signal, not as goodbye.
*   **D: Ho oma ka hlooho:** This isn't mentioned in the passage at all.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e bakang ho petsoha ha maboloko a leqhwa?","The correct answer is **A: Marokgo a lehlwa**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...hoo ka thbelwang ke marokgo a lehlwa."" ( ""...can be broken by dry rocks."").  This directly links dry rocks to causing the ice formations to break/collapse (ho petsoha).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maqhwa a sa tsitsang (Unstable ice):** While the text mentions the ice isn't stable (""diqhoqhwane ha dia tsitsa""), it doesn't say *that* is what causes the collapse, but rather that the collapse *results* from instability.
* **C: Mahaha a leqhwa a helehang (Melting ice layers):** Melting is mentioned as a *result* of the collapse (""Mabota le marulelo a mahaha a leqhwa a ka heleha mme ho petsoha ho kwalehe""), not the cause.
* **D: Maboloko a hlephileng (Healthy ice formations):** The text describes formations that are *vulnerable* to breaking, not healthy ones.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke dintho dife tse ka patwang ke matsaranka a lehlwa?","The correct answer is **C: Mabota**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mabota le marulelo a mahaha a leqhwa a ka heleha mme ho petsoha ho kwalehe."" This translates to ""Walls and the foundations of thick ice can move and collapse.""  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Letlere la majwe (Stone ladder):** The passage doesn't mention a stone ladder.
*   **B: Mahaha a nang le maqhwa ka dinako tsohle (Ice formations that are always thick):** The passage refers to *foundations* of thick ice, not formations that are always thick.
*   **D: Maboloko a maqhwa a matenya (Thin ice walls):** The passage specifically mentions *thick* ice walls (""mabota le marulelo a **mahaha** a leqhwa"").



"
"Ho latela seratswana, baeti ba lokela ho ba sedi haholo ha ba etela sebaka sefeng?","The correct answer is **B: Dibaka tse potapotileng sebaka sa Goma**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""baeti bohle ba tswang kantle ho Goma ba lokela ho hlahlojwa ho utlwisisa boemo ba ntwa e tswelang pele profensing ya North Kivu."" This implies caution is needed in the areas *around* Goma due to the ongoing conflict, not specifically the volcano (though that's a hazard too), the city center (which was damaged in the past but isn't mentioned as currently dangerous), or Rwanda.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke boeletsi bofe bo sa nepahalang bakeng sa motho ya etelang sebaka sa Goma?","The correct answer is **A: Dintwa Kivu e Leboya di a natefisa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""baeti bohle ba tswang kantle ho Goma ba lokela ho hlahlojwa ho utlwisisa boemo ba ntwa e tswelang pele profensing ya North Kivu."" This clearly indicates the ongoing conflict is a serious concern, *not* something enjoyable.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate based on the text:

* **B: Ke sebaka se setle sa ho boha ditshwene tsa dikorilla:** The text mentions Goma as a base for visiting the Virunga National Park, known for its gorillas.
* **C: Dithuthuthu tse lefellwang di hantle sebakeng sa ho tsamaya:** The text specifically mentions using ""boda-boda"" (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma.
* **D: Motheo wa thaba ya seretse se tjhesang ya Nyiragongo o toropong:** The text states Goma is a base for visiting the Nyiragongo volcano.



"
Lengolo la tumello le tla fumaneha neng ho etela sebaka se maluting maqalong a khwedi ya Phato?,"The correct answer is **A: La 1 Pherekhong**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""phemiti ya naha thote e qalang ka Motsheanong e tla fumaneha ka Pherekg."" This directly translates to ""the permit that starts in January will be available in February.""  Since you need a permit to camp in August, and permits become available four months in advance, the February permit is the one you need.
"
Ke leano lefe le teng ho tshireletsa sebaka seo e leng khorwana?,"The correct answer is **D: Mangolo a tumello a mayane ka palo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Diphemiti dia fokola ka palo bakeng sa dikopo tsa batho ba itlelang feela ka leano la ya fihlileng pele, o sebeletswa pele."" This directly translates to ""Permits are limited in number for people applying on a first-come, first-served basis.""  This means there aren't enough permits for everyone who wants one, emphasizing their scarcity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lengolo la tumello le fuwang ba le kopileng pele** - While permits *are* given to those who apply, the text emphasizes they are limited and not guaranteed simply by applying.
* **B: Mangolo a tumello a tla fumaneha feela ka la 1 Pherekhong** - This is true, but it doesn't explain the *reason* for the system - the limitation in numbers.
* **C: Mangolo a tumello a ka fumanwa feela ha motho a ikopela ona dikantorong** - The text doesn't mention how permits are obtained, only when they become available.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e sa fumaneheng ha bobebe mefutemg ya dihotele tse hlalositsweng seratswaneng?","The correct answer is **D: Diphaposi tse sa tswa lokiswa ka mekhwa ya moraorao (Newly renovated bathrooms with modern methods)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that these hotels are characterized by *old* attire, a *lack* of modern comforts, and a *historic* charm.  ""Diphaposi tse sa tswa lokiswa ka mekhwa ya moraorao"" (newly renovated bathrooms with modern methods) directly contradicts this.  The hotels are described as retaining their old character, not being updated with modern amenities.

Let's look at why the other options *are* found in the description:

*   **A: Bara e rekisang mofuta wa dino wa cocktails (A bar selling a variety of cocktails):** The passage mentions that these hotels often had ""bosiu ho ketekwa"" (nights of celebration), which would imply the presence of a bar.
*   **B: Sebaka sa ho jella se maemong a hodimo se fumanehang moo (A high-class dining area available there):** The passage states they ""hangata di ne di na le dijo tse monate"" (often had delicious food) suggesting a sophisticated dining experience.
*   **C: Baeti mmoho ba tsebahalang haholo (Together, very famous guests):** The passage specifically says they were places where ""batho ba ruileng le ba tummeng ba nako eo ba neng ba dula ho tsona"" (the wealthy and famous people of the time stayed).



"
"Ho latela ditaba tse seratswaneng, ho tse latelang, ke dintho dife tseo baeti ba ka hlokang thahasello haholo ho tsona?","The correct answer is **A: Thepa ya katlung ya mehleng ya khale empa ya boleng bo hodimo** (Antique but high-quality furnishings).

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""diaparo tsa kgale, ho hlokeha ha dintho tse thabisang, le tsela e thahasellesang ya ho hola e sa le karolo ya botho ba bona"" (old clothes, a lack of amusements, and an interesting way of growing were part of their character). This points to an appreciation for the *character* and *history* of the hotels, which is embodied in their antique furnishings.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Sebaka sa ho jella se nang le setsibi sa mopheho sa maemo a hodimo** (A dining area with a high-class chef) - While the hotels had fine dining, the passage focuses more on the atmosphere and history.
*   **C: Sebaka se fanang ka boithabiso ba bosiu** (A place offering nightlife) - The passage mentions celebration, but the hotels are described as having ""a lack of amusements,"" suggesting a different kind of experience than modern nightlife.
*   **D: Diphaposi tsa boroko tse ditjeo di bobebe** (Lightweight cotton sheets) - The passage doesn't mention bedding at all, and focuses on more significant elements of the hotel's character.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, batho ba etelang Greenland ba lokela ho qoba eng?","The correct answer is **D: Ho bitsa motho wa sebaka sa Greenland ka ho re “Eskimo”**.

The passage explicitly states: ""le hoja lentswe """"Eskimo"""" le amohelehile ka hare ho United States, le nkuwa le sa amoheleha ho batho bao e seng ba U.S. batho ba Arctic, haholo ba Canada...tsebediso ya lona e tlameha ho qojwa ke baditjhaba."" This directly indicates that visitors should avoid using the term ""Eskimo"" when referring to the people of Greenland.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage states Greenland has low crime rates and isn’t dangerous.
*   **B:** While warm clothing is recommended, it’s specifically for *certain times of the year*, not all year round.
*   **C:** The passage doesn't mention any issues with the internet or being connected.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e ka bakelang batho ba sa itlhopelang mathata ha ba etela Greenland?","The correct answer is **C: Maemo a lehodimo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Boemo ba lehodimo bo batang e batlile e le bona feela kotsi eo batho ba ka itokisetsang yona eo ba tla lebanang le yona."" (The cold weather conditions are the only hazard people can prepare for that they will encounter.) It specifically mentions needing warm clothing due to the cold, especially when traveling north or during colder seasons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mofuta wa monwang wa Nordic (Nordic flies):** The passage says they don't transmit diseases, only bite. While annoying, it doesn't indicate a serious problem.
*   **B: Botlokotsebe (Crime):** The passage states that crime and serious offenses are unknown in Greenland.
*   **D: Baahi ba lehae (Local inhabitants):** The passage doesn't suggest any issues with the local people. It actually provides information about how they identify themselves.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e seng e sebeliswa e le sebaka sa boikhathollo?","The correct answer is **C: Templo de San Diego**.

Here's why:

* **Jardín de la Unión** is described as a central hub with events happening day and night, making it a place for gathering and social interaction (a form of public space/relaxation).
* **Callejon del Beso (Alley of the Kiss)** is specifically known for its romantic legend and the practice of children telling the story for money - clearly a place associated with storytelling and tradition.
* **Templo de San Diego** is stated to be *the only remaining building* from the 17th-century religious community. While historically significant, the text doesn't suggest it's currently used as a space for social gathering or recreation, it is simply a surviving structure.

Therefore, Templo de San Diego is the only option not described as actively being used as a public space for enjoyment or interaction.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke eng e sa fumaneheng sebakeng sa Jardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **D: Meaho ya kgale ya baitlami**.

Here's why:

The text states that the Templo de San Diego is the *only* remaining building from the 17th-century religious community. This implies other old buildings are no longer there. The text *does* mention:

* **A: Tente e sebediswang ho tshwarela meketjana ya dipina** - Concerts are frequently held in a central tent.
* **B: Lehae la pale ya kgale ya lerato** - Callejon del Beso (Alley of the Kiss) is the location of a love story.
* **C: Sebaka sa ho jella se serapeng se setle** - Several dining spots surround the square.

Therefore, old colonial buildings (meaho ya kgale ya baitlami) are the only option *not* found in Jardín de la Unión according to the text."
"Ha latela seratswana, ke polelo efe ho tse latelang e buang ka ho hlwa dithaba e sa nepahalang?","The correct answer is **A: Boitukiso bo bonyane bo ntse bo hlokahala bakeng sa ho hlwa dithaba ka letsatsi ditseleng tse bonolo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that even for easy trails, ""some preparation is required"" for day hiking. This directly supports the idea that at least *some* preparation is needed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** While the passage mentions distance varies, it doesn't specifically state that it's *designed* to be finished in a day.
*   **C:** This is true according to the passage, but it doesn't relate to a misconception about hiking.
*   **D:** The passage says families *can* enjoy hiking, even with young children, but it requires more preparation - it doesn’t state it should not be done.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho hlwa dithaba ka letsatsi ho hloka boitukisetso bo fokolang neng?","The correct answer is **A: Ha motho ya hlwang dithaba a kwetlile hantle**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bakeng sa ho hahlaula naha ho ka qetwang ka letsatsi tseleng e bonolo ho hlokeha ditokisetso tse nyenyane, mme **motho le ha e le ofe ya itekanetseng hantle** a ka di thabela."" This directly translates to: ""For a day hike to be easy, little preparation is needed, and **anyone who is reasonably fit** can enjoy it.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ha ditsela di tsamaeha:** While good trails are helpful, the passage doesn't say easy hikes *require* well-maintained trails, only that they require little preparation if you're fit.
* **C: Ha bana ba lo hlwa dithabaka:** The passage actually says hiking with young children *requires more* preparation.
* **D: Ha ho hlwa dithaba ka tikolohong ya tlhaho:** This is too broad. The passage discusses hiking in general, not specifically the environment.



"
Sehlaba sa sebaka sa Rogaland kapa Agder se fapane jwang papisong le Norway kaofela?,"The correct answer is **D: Boholo di kwahetswe ke dimela tse tala**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Rogaland le Agder ka ho tlwaelehileng di bitswa """"hei"""" e bolelang sebaka se bulehileng se senang difate seo hangata se kwahetsweng ke semela se dulang se le setala.""  This directly indicates that the landscape in Rogaland and Agder is *characterized by being cultivated by low-growing vegetation*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Di na le difate:** The passage mentions *both* Norway generally and Rogaland/Agder have ""difate"" (fields). This doesn't highlight a *difference*.
*   **B: Ha ho na metsi a pakeng tsa mafika:** The passage doesn't mention anything about a lack of water between the peaks.
*   **C: Boholo ba dihlaba di a lekana:** The passage focuses on the nature of the land (fields/valleys) rather than equality in height.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e sa twaelehang ka sebaka sa Norway?","The correct answer is **D: Dihlaba tse mangope**.

Here's why:

The text states that Norway is characterized by valleys, but these valleys abruptly rise to plateaus, which are relatively flat.  The text specifically contrasts this with the landscapes of Rogaland and Agder (""hei"") which are *open areas with cultivated fields*. The unusual aspect is the sharp, unexpected rise of the valleys to plateaus – the ""dihlaba tseo ka tshohanyetso di yang ho sehlaba se phahameng"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dibaka tse bulehileng (Open areas)** - The text states these are *common* in certain regions of Norway (Rogaland and Agder), not unusual.
*   **B: Dihlaba tse morung (Deep valleys)** - Valleys are common, it's the *sudden elevation* that is notable.
*   **C: Metsi a tibileng a pakeng tsa mafika (Still water between hills)** - This isn't mentioned in the text.



"
Bahahlaudi ba ratang ho thelledisa ba tjhakela dibaka tse dithota neng?,"The correct answer is **A: Nakong ya Mariha** (During Autumn).

The text states: ""ka dibaka tse ngata tsa maralla tse fumanang boholo ba lehlwa bo lekanetseng mme di fana ka mesebetsi e kang ho thellisa lehlweng le ho thellisa lehlweng ka boto *ka nako ya mariha*.""  This directly links the activities enjoyed by those who like to hike (thellisa lehlweng) to the autumn season.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, bahahlaudi ba bangata haholo neng diseteishineng tse dithoteng?","The correct answer is **C: Nakong ya lehlabula la India**.

The passage specifically states that the observation is about areas for picnics with high humidity *during the Indian summer*. The other options are either too broad (all the time of breeding) or relate to activities *within* that time, not the time itself (harvesting/breeding)."
Seo o lokeng ho qoba ho se etsa haeba o na le tshepo ya ho fumana seketswana se hlokang thuso ke sefe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho ya hodimo le tlaase seemelong sa diketswana** (Going up and down the dock).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes actively *seeking* information and talking to people to find someone needing help. Going up and down the dock repeatedly without engaging anyone is a passive action and wouldn't be effective in gathering information.  It's the opposite of the described approach.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ho theha setswalle le batsamaisi (Making friends with managers)** - Building relationships is generally helpful when networking.
* **C: Ho bapatsa ditshebeletso tsa hao (Advertising your services)** - Offering help and letting people know you're available is directly encouraged.
* **D: Ho iphapanyetsa batho ba kopang palamiswa (Introducing yourself to people looking for mooring)** -  The passage specifically mentions meeting people seeking mooring and getting information from them.



"
O lokela ho etsang seemelong sa diketswana nakong eo o batlanang le seketswana se hlokang thuso?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho kopana le basesisi ba diketswana (Meet yacht captains)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) specifically mentions ""o ya ho batho ba hlwekisang di-yatch tsa bona, o leka ho kopana le basesisi ba dikepe bareng"" (go to people cleaning yachts, try to meet yacht captains at the bars). This clearly indicates that seeking out and talking to yacht captains is a key part of the task.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: E ba ka tla sa motjhini wa sebonela hole (They can come with a spotting machine remotely):** The passage doesn't mention anything about remote spotting machines.
* **C: Atamela batho feela ha ba hlwekisa seketswana sa bona sa boleng (Approach people only when they are cleaning their valuable yacht):** While cleaning yachts is mentioned, the passage emphasizes speaking to *many* people, not just those cleaning high-value yachts.
* **D: Qoba batho ba ratang ho kopa phalamiswa (Avoid people who like to ask for money):**  The passage doesn't mention avoiding anyone specifically; it encourages broad interaction.



"
Ke sebaka sefe se ka ratwang ke bahahlaudi nalaneng ya sehlekehleke sa bokolone?,"The correct answer is **A: Lebopong le Leboya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sena ke sebaka seo b radikoloni ba Britain ba se nkileng jwale ka sa bona, ka ho haeba o batlana le bopaki histori ya bokoloni ya sebaka, sena ke sebaka se hantle sa ho qala."" This directly links the Northern Shore (Lebopong le Leboya) to colonial history.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sebakeng sa Kowloon se pela metsi:** While Kowloon is mentioned as a good vantage point, it's not specifically tied to colonial history in the passage.
*   **C: Kgubung ya teropong ya Hong Kong:** The passage describes the skyline, but doesn't connect it to colonial history.
*   **D: Seemelong sa dikepe sa Victoria:** The Victoria Harbour is mentioned, but not as a direct source of colonial history evidence.



"
Ke sebaka se fe se ka khahlang bahahlaudi ba shebanang haholoholo le dibaka tse kgahlang mahlo?,"The correct answer is **C: Sehlekehleke sa Hong Kong**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sehlekehleke sa Hong Kong se fa sebaka sa Hong Kong lebitso la sona mme ke sebaka seo bahahlaudi ba bangata ba se nkang jwaloka sebaka sa ho eta se ka sehloohong."" (Sehlekehleke sa Hong Kong gives Hong Kong its name and is a place many tourists consider the main place to visit). It also describes its visually striking features.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Seemelong sa dikepe sa Victoria:** While Victoria Harbour is *part* of the Sehlekehleke sa Hong Kong, it's not the area itself.
*   **B: Hong Kong e loketse:** This is too broad – the passage is about a *specific* area within Hong Kong.
*   **D: Sebakeng sa Kowloon se pela metsi:** Kowloon is mentioned as a good viewpoint *of* Sehlekehleke sa Hong Kong, not the area itself.



"
Disale tse ding di na le eng e thusang khahlanong le menyatla ya kotsi e etsang hore leoto la sepalami le tshwarehe ka hara moraho wa sale?,"The correct answer is **B: Mekwallo ya polokeho**.

The text states: ""Se latelang, disale tse ding, ka ho kgethehileng disale tsa Senyesemane, di na le **ditshepe tsa ho sireletseha** tse dumellang letlalo la stirrup hore le we ho tswa saleng haeba se hulelwa morao ke mopalami ya welang fatshe.""

""Ditshepe tsa ho sireletseha"" translates to ""safety mechanisms"" or ""safety features"" which aligns with ""mekwallo ya polokeho"". The other options are not mentioned in the text as providing this specific safety function.



"
Ke karolo efe ya dieta tsa bapalami e ba thusang ho ntlafatsa polokeho ya bona ha ba sebedisa moraho wa sale?,"The correct answer is **C: Serethe**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that many riders wear boots with a **heel and a smooth sole** to help prevent their feet from getting stuck in the stirrups. The heel (serethe) is the part of the boot that helps maintain a secure position in the stirrup while also allowing the foot to release more easily if a fall occurs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sole e thata e mopatisane (a sturdy, flat sole):** While a sturdy sole is important, it's the *combination* with the heel that provides safety.
*   **B: Letlalo (the foot):** The foot itself isn't a piece of equipment.
*   **D: Sole e sephara (a wide sole):** The passage emphasizes a *smooth* sole, not necessarily a wide one.



"
Ke eng se ka fuwang baeti ho marangrang a kamohelo ya baeti?,"The correct answer is **A: Kamohelo ya baeti ke batho ba lehae** (Hospitality from locals).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that guest welcoming platforms *connect travelers with people in the areas they are visiting*. This means they offer hospitality *from* locals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maeto a difofane a ditjeo tse bobebe** (Cheap plane tickets) - The passage mentions Casey Fenton needing a cheap flight, but the platform isn't *about* providing cheap flights, it's about lodging.
* **C: Maeto tlasa bolaodi ba batho ba lehae** (Tours led by locals) -  While locals might *offer* tours, the core of the platform is about accommodation, not necessarily guided tours.
* **D: Ho kopana le baeti ba bang ba etetseng sebakeng se tshwanang** (Meeting other travelers visiting the same area) - The passage mentions reviews *from* other travelers, but the platform's primary function isn't to connect travelers *with each other*, but with locals who can offer lodging.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke polelo efe ho tsa marang-rang a kamohelo ya baeti eo e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **D: Ka nako e nngwe baeti ba ka fumana lethathamo la maikutlo ka batho ba dulang le baeti.**

Here's why:

The passage states that lists of hosts may include *reviews and verification* from other travelers, not a list of opinions *about* hosts from travelers. Reviews are a form of verification, not general feelings.

Let's look at why the other options are true, based on the text:

*   **A: Baeti ba fuwa batho ba ka dulang ha bona** - The passage explicitly explains that the system connects travelers with locals offering accommodation.
*   **B: Marang-rang a mang a ka eketsa mokhwa wa ho netefatsa baeti** - The passage states that some systems offer or require additional verification.
*   **C: Baeti ba tla fuwa lethathamo la batho ba ka dulang ha bona toropong eo ba yang ho yona** - The passage mentions lists of available hosts are available (printed or online).



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mofuta ofe wa baeti o sa fumaneheng habobe diphaphosing tse kopanetsweng tsa boroko?","The correct answer is **C: Moeti ya tsamayang le bana ba banyane**.

Here's why:

The passage states that families with children are ""rarely"" found in hostels, and some hostels don't allow them in dorm rooms at all. This implies that travelers with young children are the least likely to be found in shared hostel dorms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Moeti ya dilemong tse mashome a mabedi (Traveler in their twenties):** The passage specifically says this is the *typical* hostel guest.
*   **B: Moeti ya tsamayang a lemong (Solo traveler):** The passage states that hostels cater well to solo travelers.
*   **D: Moeti ya bohareng ba dilemo di mashome a mararo (Traveler in their thirties):** While not the *typical* guest, older travelers are still mentioned as sometimes being present.

"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang ya ka nnang a dula sebakeng sa bodulo se kopanetsweng?","The correct answer is **B: Batho ba bararo ba dilemo di 22 ba tsamayang mmoho** (Three 22-year-olds traveling together).

Here's why:

The passage states the typical guest is in their twenties. While older travelers *can* be found, the focus is on younger people.  Options A, C, and D don't fit this demographic.

* **A** focuses on a baby, not the typical age group.
* **C** describes elderly people, who the text says are less common.
* **D** mentions families, and the text states that while some hostels allow families in private rooms, they are less common.

Option B directly matches the described typical guest: people in their twenties traveling together.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke polelo efe e hlalosang ka nepo papali ya Boomerang?","The correct answer is **A: E tla khutlela ho wena ha o e bitsitse ka nepo**

Here's why:

The passage states ""Haeba o batla ho ithuta ho lahlela boomerang e tla kgutla hape letsohong la hao..."" This directly means it will return to you if thrown correctly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: E tlwaelehile haholo ho batho ba lehae ho feta ho bahahlaudi** - The passage doesn't compare popularity between locals and audiences. It only says it's a skill many *audiences* want.
*   **C: Austrilia ha e na diboomerang tse ngata** - The passage states many boomerangs are *found* in Australia, but then says many of them *don't* return.
*   **D: Ke diboomerang tse ding feela tse ka khutlang** - The passage specifically says you need a *suitable* boomerang for returning, meaning not all do, but some are designed to.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e sebeliswang haholo mokhweng wa ho pheha wa Javanese?","The correct answer is **C: Tswekere ya khokhonate**.

The passage specifically states: ""...tswekere (haholo-holo tswekere ya Java ya kokonate)..."" which translates to ""...sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar)..."" indicating coconut sugar is a key ingredient in Javanese cuisine.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, mafu a tshwaetsanang a nama jwang?","The correct answer is **A: Batho ba tshwaelitsweng** (People infected).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bolwetsi bo tshwaetsanang ke bolwetsi bo fetelanang habonolo ka ho ba haufi le motho ya nang le bolwetsi.""  This directly translates to ""An infectious disease is a disease that spreads easily by being close to a person who has the disease.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kokwana-hloko ya pathogen** (Pathogen vector) - While pathogens *cause* infectious diseases, the text defines infectious diseases as spreading *from people* who are infected.
* **C: Baktheria** (Bacteria) - Bacteria are a *type* of thing that *causes* disease, but not how infectious diseases spread.
* **D: Diente** (Teeth) - This is irrelevant to the definition of infectious diseases.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e sa tsejweng e ka bakang mafu a tshwaetsanang?","The correct answer is **B: Dikokwana-hloko** (Mosquitoes).

Here's why:

The passage states that communicable diseases are caused by things *like* mosquitoes, bacteria, fungus, or parasites. It doesn't explicitly say mosquitoes *cause* contagious diseases, but they are given as an example of a source of communicable diseases which can easily spread through close contact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Diente** - This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Dibaktheria** - The passage *lists* bacteria as a cause of communicable diseases, but doesn't suggest it's unknown.
*   **D: Difungus** - Similar to bacteria, the passage lists fungus as a known cause.



"
Ke maemong afe ao ho ka kgethwang marang-rang a inthanete ho ena le VPN ya motho ka mong ho ka lokelang mosebedisi?,"The correct answer is **B: Mosebedisi o ngongoreha ke ho qoba dithiblelo le dihlwela ka tsela tsohle** (User is concerned about avoiding restrictions and breaches in all ways).

Here's why:

* **The passage states** that personal VPNs are good for bypassing both political censorship *and* commercial IP-geofiltering. They offer a wider protection than simply getting around website blocks.  They are also built with privacy in mind, making them harder to trace.
* **Option B** directly reflects this all-encompassing need for security and bypass of restrictions.  

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Mosebedisi o batla ho fapohisa sephethephethe kaofela** (User wants to change the entire network) - While a VPN does change your apparent network, the primary *reason* for using it isn't just to change it, but to *protect* while doing so.
* **C: Mosebedisi o fapohisa sephethephethe sa marang-rang** (User changes the network connection) - Similar to A, this focuses on the act of changing, not the underlying security/bypass need.
* **D: Mosebedisi o hloka marang-rang a hlwahlwa** (User needs an unblocked network) -  This is only *one* benefit of a VPN, not the core reason to choose a personal VPN over other methods.  You might want an unblocked network, but a personal VPN offers more than just that (privacy, security).



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke polelo efe eo e seng nnete ka VPN le Web Proxies?","The correct answer is **D: Di VPN di fetola feela tsela ya sephethephethe sa mofuta wa http**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that VPNs are a solution for *all* internet traffic, not just http.  It says: ""Ke tsela ya sephethephethe sohle sa Inthanete, eseng feela http.""

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Di VPN di hlwahlwa ho feta Web proxies:** The passage says VPNs are ""made with privacy in mind"" implying they are more secure and thus harder to compromise.
*   **B: We proxies di ka se fetole tsela ya sephethephethe sa batho ba kenang ho marangrang:** While not stated directly, the context implies VPNs offer more comprehensive routing, meaning proxies have more limitations.
*   **C: Web proxies di na le ditshebeletso tsa boleng bo tlase papisong le di VPN:** The passage says VPNs usually provide faster networks and higher quality services.



"
Ke eng se ka dumellang motho ho sebedisa khamphani ya mehala e kantle ho sebaka sa moo a le teng?,"The correct answer is **B: Dinomoro tse sebetsang lefatshe lohle** (International toll-free numbers).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states you need to ""reka nomoro ya lefatshe lohle e le nngwe e dumellang mehala ya PSTN hore e ho letsetse"" (buy a worldwide number that allows PSTN calls to be made).  This is the key enabling factor.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho letsa ka marang-rang (VoIP)** While VoIP *uses* the internet, the passage isn't about the technology itself, but about what allows you to have a number that isn't tied to your location.
* **C: Sathalaete (Satellite)** Satellite internet allows *access* to the internet, but doesn't explain how you get a phone number disconnected from your physical location. The passage uses the Chicken, Alaska example to illustrate that internet access isn't the issue – it's the phone number.
* **D: Difono tsa PSTN (PSTN phones)** PSTN phones are the traditional landline system. The passage discusses moving *away* from being limited by PSTN location restrictions.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng se ka etswang ho amohela mehala e itseng?","The correct answer is **A: Ho reka nomoro e letsetsang lefatshe lohle**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hangata, o lokela ho reka nomoro ya lefatshe lohle e le nngwe e dumellang mehala ya PSTN hore e ho letsetse."" This means to receive certain calls (PSTN calls), you often need to purchase a toll-free number.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ho sebedisa khamphani ya lehae ya mehala** - The passage explains how you *don't* need a local phone company due to satellite internet.
*   **C: Ho fumana nomoro ya sebakeng se haufinyane** - Again, the passage states you *don't* need a local number.
*   **D: Ho reka fono ya moetso wa PSTN** - While related to the system, it's the *number* you need to buy, not the phone itself.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe, e sa hlaloseng ka nepo ho bitswa hwa mantswe a Setadiana?","The correct answer is **A: Di “r” tse pedi di bitswa ka tsela e fapaneng le “r” e le nngwe**.

The passage explicitly states: ""etša bonnete ba ho bitsa r le rr ka tsela e fapaneng: caro e bolela ya ratehang, ha carro e bolela koloi."" This means the double ""r"" is pronounced differently than a single ""r"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Boholo ba mantswe a bitswa jwalo ka ha a ngotswe:** The passage *starts* by saying this is generally true, making it a correct statement, but not the one the question is looking for – the question wants the statement that is *not* a good description of Italian pronunciation.
* **C: Mantswe a nang le “c” le “g” a ka sokodisa:** The passage *highlights* that ""c"" and ""g"" can be tricky, so this is a correct observation.
* **D: Ho bitswa hwa mantswe ho fapana ho latela seduma-nosi se hlahlamang:**  The passage states this is true, referring to vowel sounds changing pronunciation.



"
Ke ditshobotsi dife tsa toropo ya Izmir tse qadileng pele ho matsatsi a moraorao?,"The correct answer is **D: Marulelo a dithaele tse kgubedu**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""marulelo a dithaele a moetlo tse kgubedu"" (bright, patterned awnings) as a characteristic of the modern shopping centers, linking it to a more recent development. The other options are either general features that could exist across time (open streets) or describe older structures (glass-fronted buildings, old mosques/churches).  The awnings are presented as a detail of *current* shopping centers.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe eo eseng tshobotsi ya nnete ya toropo ya Izmir?","The correct answer is **B: Boemo ba yona bo fana ka sebophe sa setso sa naha ya Turkey**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...though the city feels more like European Mediterranean than a Turkish cultural center."" This directly contradicts option B.

Let's look at why the other options *are* true based on the passage:

*   **A: Toropo e potapotile kou e kgolo** - The text says Izmir is ""surrounding a large harbor.""
*   **C: O ka fumana setsi sa mabelenke sa sejwale-jwale le dikereke tsa kgale** - The passage mentions ""modern shopping centers"" and ""ancient mosques and churches.""
*   **D: E na le seemelo sa dikepe sa bobedi se seholo Turkey** - The text states it is the second largest port after Istanbul.



"
Lentswe “hanami” le bolela ho boha eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Difate tsa dithungthung tsa cheri**.

The passage states that ""hanami"" is known as the viewing of cherry blossoms. Therefore, ""hanami"" refers to cherry blossoms (dithungthung tsa cheri).
"
Ke mang ya qalileng ho etsa mekete ya boithabiso ya ho boha difate tsa lithungthung tsa dicheri?,"The correct answer is **D: Bahlomphei ba China**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kgopolo e hlahile Chaena moo dipalesa tsa sefate sa purumu e ne e le palesa e ratwang."" which translates to ""The idea originated in China where peach blossoms were a beloved flower."" This indicates that the practice of appreciating blossoms, starting with peach blossoms, began with Chinese aristocracy.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke dikarolo dife tsa Jerusalema tse ke keng tsa kgahla bahahlaudi haholo?","The correct answer is **C: Moetlo wa ho etsa dihlabelo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Jerusalema is a major tourist destination *because* of its historical sites, religious significance, and vibrant markets. It doesn't mention any difficulties with shopping.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bohlokwa ba bodumedi toropong** - The text emphasizes Jerusalema's importance to three religions as a key reason for tourism.
*   **B: Boemo ba yona ba hore ke motse-moholo wa Iseraele** - The passage acknowledges the debate about its status as the capital but still highlights its appeal as a tourist destination.
*   **D: Dibaka tse ngata tsa nalane** - The text directly says Jerusalema has ""many historical, archaeological, and cultural sites,"" drawing tourists.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke eng e sa bolelwang seratswaneng e tsebahalang haholo ka Jerusalema?","The correct answer is **B: Tshutshumetso ya dipolotiki (Political significance)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    *   **Nalane e kgahlang (Fascinating history):** ""Toropo ya kgale Dithabeng tsa Judea e na le histori e thahasellisang e nkileng dikete tsa dilemo.""
    *   **Bohlokwa ba bodumeli (Religious significance):** ""Toropo ya halalela madumeding a mararo a dumelang ho Modimo a le mong - Bojuda, Bokreste le Boislamo, mme ke setsi sa bomoya, bodumedi, le setso.""
    *   **Dibaka tsa botjhaba (Tourist attractions):** ""Jerusalema ke engwe ya dibaka tse ka sehloohong tseo bahahlaudi ba di etelang Iseraele… e na le ditsi tse ngata tsa histori, tsa dintho tsa kgale le tsa setso, hammoho le dbaka tsa ho reka tse phetheselang le tse tletseng batho...""

*   **The passage does *not* directly address the political complexities** surrounding Jerusalem's status as Israel's capital and the international dispute over its recognition. While it *hints* at it with the first sentence (""le ha dinaha tse ngata tse ding le Ditjhaba tse Kopaneng di sa e nke jwalo ka motse-moholo wa Iseraele""), it doesn't elaborate on the political implications.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke baeti bafe ba ke keng ba una molemo ha ba reka karete e bitswang Wild Card?","The correct answer is **D: Moeti ya rerileng ho etela sebaka sa Kruger sa diphoofolo tse hlaha le dibakeng tse ding** (A guest planning to visit Kruger National Park and other parks).

Here's why:

The text states the Wild Card ""allows access to various parks in South Africa or all South African National Parks."" Therefore, it's *most* beneficial for someone visiting multiple parks, including Kruger. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baeti ba rerang ho etela dirapa tse fapaneng** (Guests planning to visit different parks) - This is too broad. The Wild Card is only beneficial if they visit *South African* National Parks.
*   **B: Baeti ba tjhakelang sebakeng sa Kruger sa diphoofolo tse hlaha** (Guests visiting only Kruger National Park) - The text says there's an entrance fee for Kruger specifically, and the Wild Card is best for *multiple* parks.
*   **C: Baeti ba ngongoreileng ke ditifiso tsa dirapeng** (Guests interested in park certifications) - The text doesn't mention anything about certifications, it's about park access.



"
Ke polelo efe e sa hlaloseng ka nepo sebaka sa Kruger sa diphoofolo tse hlaha?,"The correct answer is **C: E nyane ka ho fitisisa dibakeng tsa Afrika Borwa tsa diphoofolo tse hlaha**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Serapa ke sebaka se 19,500 km²"" (The park is 19,500 km² in size). This is a *large* area, not a small one.
*   **The passage supports:**
    *   **A:** Kruger is one of the main attractions in South Africa.
    *   **B:** The park is divided into 14 different areas, each with different wildlife.
    *   **D:** The Wild Card allows access to the park.

Therefore, option C is the only statement *not* supported by the provided text and is, in fact, the opposite of what the text says."
Ke eng enka bakang mathata ho batho ba hlwang dithaba moo di leng telele?,"The correct answer is **A: Maemo a mongobo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kahoo, lebella hore o tla fellwa ke moya"" (Therefore, expect to be breathless).  Breathlessness at high altitudes is a common challenge for people climbing mountains, making ""altitude"" the factor causing difficulty.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mehato ya majwe (Stone steps):** While the steps exist, the passage states they are *built along* the trail, aiding the climb, not hindering it.
* **C: Mahaheng a manyane (Small ledges):** The passage mentions a small ledge near the summit as needing to be traversed carefully, but it doesn't state this causes general difficulty for climbers.
* **D: Dithapo tsa tshepe (Steel cables):** These are provided *as support* to make the climb easier and safer.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke polelo efe e sa nepahalang mabapi le bophahamo bo otlolohileng ba thaba ya Machu Picchu bo hlalositsweng seratswaneng?","The correct answer is **B: Ha ho na moo ho itshwareletswang bophahamong bohle ba thaba**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""dikarolong tsa meepa dithapo tsa tshepe di fana ka tshehetso ya ho beha matsoho."" This clearly indicates there *are* sections with steel cables to assist climbers, meaning there are areas where support/safety is provided.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Bahlwi ba dithaba ba kwetlileng ba ka fellwa ke moya** - The passage says ""lebella hore o tla fellwa ke moya"".
*   **C: O lokela ho feta le lehaheng le hodimo** - The passage mentions ""lehaha le lenyenyane haufi le tlhoro eo ho tshwanetsweng ho fetwe ho lona.""
*   **D: Bophahamo ba thaba bo ba kotsi ha ho le mongobo** - The passage warns about the danger of slipping, especially when wet, stating it ""ho ka ba kotsi ka potlako.""



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke dijo dife tseo e seng tsa mantlha tsa Majorcan?","The correct answer is **A: Nama**.

Here's why:

The passage states Majorcan cuisine is *based on* vegetables, fruits, and meat (especially lamb). This implies meat isn't the foundation, but a component *within* a base of other foods. The other options - bohobe (cereal), meroho (vegetables) and dijo-thollo (stews) are all mentioned as being foundational elements of the cuisine. 

Therefore, nama (meat) is the one that's *part of* the diet, but not the basis *of* it, making it the 'not main' dish."
"Ho ipapisitswe le seratswana, ke polelo efe eseng nnete ka dijo tse phehelwang ka mokoting?","The correct answer is **B: Ho phehela ka mokoting o sebelisa majwe ho fuamaneha sebakeng sa Wellington**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hangata e sebediswa ho pheha dinara e tlwaelehileng ya mofuta o besitsweng."" (It's often used to cook a standard type of meat). It does *not* say hangi using stones is found in Wellington. It just says hangi is found there generally.
* **A is true:** The passage explicitly mentions using heated stones from the ocean.
* **C is true:** ""Hangata e sebediswa ho pheha dinara..."" - means meat is commonly cooked this way.
* **D is true:** ""Dibaka tse mmalwa Rotorua di fana ka hangi..."" - Rotorua offers hangi.

Therefore, option B is the only statement that isn’t directly supported by the text.



"
Ke eng e sa bolelwang e le tlwelaelo ya ho phehela mokoting ya ho futhumatsa sekoti?,"The correct answer is **B: Majwe a tjhesang**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the hangi can be heated using ""majwe a tjhesang a tswang mollong"" (heating stones from the river).  It then contrasts this with natural geothermal heat. The question asks what isn't mentioned as a traditional method of *heating* the cooking pit. While geothermal heat is mentioned, heating stones are specifically described as a traditional method. The other options aren't mentioned in the context of heating the hangi.



"
Ke eng e ka bakwang ke ho fumana temoho e kgethehileng ya baitlami ba basadi le ba banna?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho apara lesela le ithatelang le kganyang** (Wearing a bright, patterned shawl).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that bringing your own shawl, *especially one with bright colors*, will please the host (male or female). This indicates a special welcome or positive reception.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ho kwahela mahetla** (Covering your hair) - This is *required* for women, not something that causes a special reaction.
*   **C: Ho kadima lesela le ithatelang mmeleng boitlaming** (Wrapping a shawl around the body in excitement) - The text doesn't mention anything about how to wear the shawl, just that bringing a bright one is appreciated.
*   **D: Ho apara mose o ka hodima lengwele** (Wearing a robe over a garment) - This relates to the required attire, not a special reception.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke mefuta efe ya diphahlo e ka adingwang matlong a baitlami? ","The correct answer is **B: Marikgwe a makgutswanyane** (Short robes).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""banna ho hlokahala hore ba apare borikgwe bo kwahelang mangole"" (men are required to wear short robes).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dikhete** (Suits) - The passage doesn't mention suits.
*   **C: Marikgwe a matelele** (Long robes) - The passage specifically mentions *short* robes.
*   **D: Masela a ithatelang** (Towels) - While towels are offered, they are for covering up if you don't have your own robe, not a standard item provided or required.



"
Baeti ba ka ba le monyetla wa ho boha dinaledi neng ha ba tjhaketse moo ho batang Antarctic?,"The correct answer is **C: Nakong ya mariha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Senase fana ka monyetla o motle wa ho bona Aurora borealis, kaha sepakapaka se tla ba setsho hoo e ka bang letsatsi lohle."" This directly links the opportunity to see stars (and the Aurora) with the darkness of winter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nakong ya kgwedi tsa lehlabula:** The passage implies darkness is *less* common in summer.
*   **B: Ha sebaka se se na sephethephethe se sengata:** While true, this isn't the *timing* of when stars are best seen.
*   **D: Ha tshilafalo ya kganya e le nyane:** The passage mentions low light pollution as a bonus, but the primary reason for star viewing is the long periods of darkness during winter.



"
Ke neng fono ya sathalaete e ke keng ya nka sebaka sa mohala wa thekeng?,"The correct answer is **A: Haeba pono ho ya fihla sathalaeteng e ka sitiseha** (If the view to the satellite is obstructed).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...o lokela ho ba kantle o bona hantle sathelaete ha o letsa mohala"" (you must be outside with a clear view of the satellite when making a call).  This means a satellite phone *cannot* replace a cell phone if there's something blocking the signal to the satellite.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Haeba sebaka se le hole** (If the location is remote) - While satellite phones *are* used in remote locations, this doesn't explain *why* they can't replace cell phones. They still work in remote areas *as long as* there's a clear view of the satellite.
*   **C: Haeba e tla sebediswa kantle** (If it will be used outdoors) -  Using it outdoors is a *requirement* for it to work, not a reason it can't replace a cell phone.
*   **D: Ha leeto le na le tlhoko ya data** (If the trip requires data) - The passage mentions data as a use case, but doesn't explain why it can't replace a cell phone.



"
Fono ya sathalaete e hlokahala ho feta selefono neng?,"The correct answer is **B: Leetong la sekepe**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that satellite phones are often used by people traveling on boats (recreational vessels). It also highlights their use in remote areas where traditional cell service is unavailable. A sea voyage is a prime example of a situation where cell service is unreliable, making a satellite phone a necessary alternative.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nakong eo o ileng phomolong toropong:** Cities generally have cell service.
*   **C: Ha data ya ho le e sa hlokahale:** Satellite phones aren't just about data; they're about voice communication in areas without cell service.
*   **D: Ha o ka etsahala o fumane kgokahano e lekaneng ya mohala wa thekeng:**  The entire point of a satellite phone is when you *can't* get sufficient local cell service.



"
Ke qwaketsano ya eng bakileng ho thehwa hwa naha ya Transinistria Republic?,"The correct answer is **B: Morabe**.

The text states: ""Ka 1994, kgohlano ena e ile ya lebisa ho thehweng ha Repabliki e ipolelang e le Transnistria..."" (In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria...).  The conflict being referred to is a *racial* conflict (""khohlano ya merabe"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Moruo (Economy):** While economic ties exist *despite* the political issues, the text doesn't say the economy *caused* Transnistria to form.
*   **C: Puo (Language):** The text mentions language (Russian and Romanian are used), but doesn't link it to the formation of Transnistria.
*   **D: Tumelo (Religion):** Religion (Orthodox Christianity) is mentioned as a main belief, but isn’t connected to the creation of Transnistria.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe eo Transnistria Republic e nang le yona e fapaneng le Moldova yohle?  ","The correct answer is **C: Ho ananelwa ke dinaha tsa matjhaba a kopaneng (Recognition by the United Nations)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Transnistria ""ha e hlokomelwe ke naha le ha e le efe eo e leng karolo ya UN"" (is not recognized by any country that is part of the UN).  The other options are things it shares with Moldova:

*   **Puo (Language):** Both use Romanian/Russian.
*   **Tumelo (Religion):** Both predominantly practice Orthodox Christianity.
*   **Mofuta wa tjhelete (Currency):** The text says Transnistria has its own currency, but doesn't state Moldova doesn't have its own.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, baeti ba lokela ho tjhakela sebaka sa Montevidio neng ha ba sa rate moya o mongata?","The correct answer is **A: Nakong ya dikgweli tsa mariha ka leboya** (During the winter months in the north).

Here's why:

* The passage states that the combination of wind and humidity makes it *feel* colder than the thermometer reads. If a traveler dislikes wind, they should avoid the times when wind is prominent. The passage connects this feeling to the winter months.
* The passage states that during winter (mariha), temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nakong yeo ho omeletseng sebakeng sa Montevidio** (During dry times in Montevideo): The passage says rainfall is consistent throughout the year, there are no distinctly dry seasons.
* **C: Nakong ya dikgwedi tsa lehlabula leboya** (During the summer months in the north): The passage says summer is *hot* (+30°C), and while humid, doesn't imply it's windy.
* **D: Nakong ya dikgwedi tsa mariha sebakeng sa Montevidio** (During the winter months in Montevideo): While this is *when* it's windy, it doesn't answer *why* a traveler would avoid it, and A is a better response to the question.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, moeti o lokela ho etela toropo e kgolo ya Montevideo neng haeba a thahasella dinako tse batang tsa selemo?","The correct answer is **A: Nakong yeo e leng hlabula sebakeng sa Montevedio**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Montevideo experiences hot summers (temperatures exceeding +30°C) and mild winters (""mariha a ka bata haholo: dithempereitjhara ha dia tlwaela ho feta tlaase ha ntlha ya kgwamo""). This means the cooler temperatures happen during their winter, which is described as mild.  Therefore, someone wanting cooler weather should visit during Montevideo's winter (their hlabula).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nakong yeo ebleng hlabula ka leboya:** The passage doesn't mention a specific ""winter in the north."" It focuses on Montevideo's seasons.
*   **C: Nakong ya dipula:** The passage explicitly states there are no defined rainy seasons (""Ha ho na dinako tse tobileng tsa “pula”"").
*   **D: Nakong ya mariha tikolohong e leboya:**  ""Mariha"" refers to the mild winter in Montevideo itself, not a separate northern location.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke ntho efe ho tse latelang e ka amahangwang le ssa mengolo se molaongkgahlanong le tshenyo?","The correct answer is **A: Diketsahalo tsa botaki ba mengolo (Graffiti events)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that there are now ""known graffiti artists, graffiti events and 'legal' walls."" This implies that graffiti events are a way graffiti is done legally and as an art form, contrasting with vandalism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ho ngola (Writing)** - While graffiti *involves* writing, the passage doesn’t specifically connect writing itself with legality.
*   **C: Boitshwaro bo sa hlokahaleng thepeng ya setjhaba (Vandalism of public property)** - The passage contrasts this *with* legal graffiti.
*   **D: Matshwao a seng molaong (Illegal markings)** - The passage directly opposes this to the new, legal forms of graffiti.



"
Ke dikarolo dife tsa mekete ya dipina tseo batho ba nkang di le bohlokwa?,"The correct answer is **B: Ho khempa sebakeng seo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that many people consider *camping* at the festival grounds to be an important part of the experience (""ba bangata ba leng teng ba e nka jwaloka karolo e bohlokwa ya seo ba se etsang""). 

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ho tlisa bana ba banyenyane** - The passage mentions family camping areas, but doesn't say bringing children is a key part *for everyone*.
*   **C: Mmino o llang bosiu haholo** -  While the passage mentions music continuing late, it doesn't say that's the *important* part people value.
*   **D: Ho fihla ka nako** - Arriving early is practical for getting a good camping spot, but the passage focuses on the value of the camping *itself*, not just getting there early.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, motho a yang moketeng wa dipina o moholo o lokela ho sheba eng haholoholo haeba o batla ho khempa pela moo ho binelwang?","The correct answer is **D: Ho fihla ka nako**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""If you want to see what is happening up close you need to arrive early to get a camping spot close to the music."" This directly implies that arriving early (ho fihla ka nako) is crucial for securing a good camping spot near the music.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho fihla bosiu haholo** - The passage mentions music continuing late into the night, but doesn't say arriving late is beneficial for camping. In fact, it implies the opposite.
*   **B: Ho dula dibakeng tsa malapa** - The passage mentions family camping areas, but not that someone *should* specifically aim for them.
*   **C: Ho khempa ka thokwana ho sebaka seo** - The passage doesn't mention anything about camping with a group. It focuses on getting a spot *close* to the music.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, baeti ba lokela ho qoba eng ha ba batla ho ya menateng ya bosiu ka leboya ho New Mexico?","The correct answer is **B: Dibara tse torotswaneng** (Small town bars).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Note: small town bars here are not often good places for an out-of-state visitor looking to relax. That is because Northern New Mexico has a lot of problems with drunk drivers, and the vast majority of drunk drivers are packed into the small bars near towns."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pueblos:** The passage doesn't mention anything negative about Pueblos.
*   **C: Di Mall:** The passage doesn't mention malls at all.
*   **D: Dikhasinong:** While the passage mentions casinos, it doesn't suggest avoiding them. It says they offer dining and some have entertainment, especially those near larger cities.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke sebaka sefe ka leboya ho New Mexico moo moeti a ka fumanang sebaka sa boithabiso se tummeng, habobebe?","The correct answer is **C: Khasino e pela Sante Fe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...the few that have recognizable entertainment (mainly the larger ones closest to Albuquerque and Santa Fe)."" This directly suggests casinos near Santa Fe are more likely to have well-known entertainment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Khasinong, e ka bang dihora tse pedi ho tloha sebakeng sa Albuquerque:** The passage mentions casinos within a two-hour drive of Albuquerque, but doesn't specify they have *recognizable* entertainment.
*   **B: “Pueblo” e hole toropo:** The passage doesn't discuss Pueblos or their entertainment options.
*   **D: Bareng e torotswaneng:** The passage specifically cautions against small-town bars due to intoxicated patrons.



"
Baeti ba tsitsang bajeteng ya bona ba ka batla ho qoba dino dife?,"The correct answer is **B: Metsi a rekiswang**.

Here's why:

The text states that tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available *if you are worried*. This implies bottled water is an unnecessary expense for budget travelers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Veine ya Austrlia:** The text suggests New Zealand and Australian wines might be *better*, not that they should be avoided.
*   **C: Jwala ba lehae:** The text mentions ""Number One"" and ""Manta"" as local beers, and doesn't indicate they are expensive.
*   **D: Terinki ya ditholwana:** There's no mention of a ""nut drink"" or anything similar in the text.

Therefore, avoiding bottled water is the most practical way for a budget traveler to save money based on the information provided."
"Ho latela sebaka se hlalositsweng seratswaneng seo, ho tse latelang ke otara efe ya dino e ka ferekanngwang ke mofani wa dino?","The correct answer is **C: Sauvignon Blanc ya New Zealand**.

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions that New Zealand wines are ""perhaps a little better"" than the local Fura wines.  This makes Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand a direct offering from the described location.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Short black:** The text describes ""espresso"" as being black coffee, but doesn't present it as a common offering.
*   **B: Number One:** This refers to a type of beer, not a wine.
*   **D: Flat White:** The text explicitly states that Australians are unfamiliar with ""flat white"" coffee.



"
Taba ya bokolone e nkileng dilemo tse makgolo a mararo e qadilwe ke sehlopha sefe?,"The correct answer is **D: Batho ba Spain**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Batho ba Spain ba qadile nako ya ho etsa dikoloni e nkileng dilemo tse makgolo a mararo."" (The Spanish people started a period of colonization that lasted three centuries).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Payaguá** - The text mentions the Payaguá as an indigenous group who survived by fishing, gathering, and hunting.
*   **B: Guaycurú** - The text mentions the Guaycurú as an indigenous group inhabiting the Chaco region.
*   **C: Guaraní** - The text describes the Guaraní as indigenous people who farmed to meet their needs *before* colonization. They were impacted *by* colonization, but didn't initiate it.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mokhwa ofe o motle wa ho etsa motho ya hlahang Paris a o phuthulohele?","The correct answer is **C: Ho bontsha tlhompho (Showing respect)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the best way to live in Paris is to behave properly, to be ""bien élevé"" (well-bred), and that Parisian rudeness will quickly disappear if you show good manners. Showing good manners *is* demonstrating respect.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho leka ho etsisa boikutlo ba batho ba hlahang Paris (Trying to imitate the feelings of Parisians):** The text doesn’t say anything about imitating feelings, but rather about behaving well.
* **B: Ho bontsha boitshepo (Showing confidence):** While confidence isn’t necessarily *bad*, the passage focuses on politeness and manners, not confidence. In fact, arrogance could be misinterpreted as the negative traits the passage mentions.
* **D: Ho bontsha boitswharo ba ho rata ho ba le batho (Showing a sociable demeanor):**  Again, this isn’t the core message. The focus is on *how* you behave, not just being friendly.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e nkuwang e se ya tse ke keng tsa fetolwa ka batho ba hlahang Paris?","The correct answer is **A: Boikgohomoso**.

Here's why:

The passage states Parisians are *reputed* to be arrogant and self-absorbed (""ho ikgohomosa""). However, it also says this is often a *misconception* (""hangata sena e le maikutlo a sa nepahaleng"").  This implies that while the stereotype exists, it isn't necessarily inherent to people from Paris.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ho tella:** The passage doesn't mention anything about rudeness.
*   **C: A boswasi:** The passage doesn’t refer to a lack of wisdom in Parisians.
*   **D: Ho se hlomphe:** The passage doesn’t refer to a lack of respect.

The passage specifically frames arrogance/self-absorption as something that *might not* be true, making it the characteristic considered potentially changeable or not fixed."
Molemo wa ho dula boemong ba pele tereneng e mathang ka tlase ho lefatshe Cape town ke ofeng?,"The correct answer is **A: Bodulo ba maemo a hodimo bo qalong ya terene**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""materoko a MetroPlus a dula a le qetellong ya terene haufi haholo le Cape Town."" MetroPlus is the more luxurious service. Therefore, sitting in the front of the train (closest to Cape Town) means you are in the MetroPlus carriages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ha ho na batho ba bangata:** The passage doesn't state MetroPlus is less crowded, only that it doesn't *fill up*.
*   **C: E ditjeo li bobebe ho feta sebaka sa maemo a boraro tereneng:** The passage says MetroPlus is *more* expensive, not cheaper.
*   **D: Ditjeo tsa teng di lekana le tekete ya Metro:** The passage specifically says MetroPlus costs *more* than regular Metro tickets.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, kaofela diterene tsa basebetsi tsa Cape Town di na le eng?","The correct answer is **D: Boemo bo phahameng ba pele le boemo ba boraro**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Each train has both MetroPlus and Metro carriages; the MetroPlus carriages are always at the end of the train closest to Cape Town."" 

This means *every* train has carriages from both the MetroPlus (first class) and Metro (third class) groups.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sebaka sa maemo a hodimo se nang le batho ba fokolang** - While MetroPlus is more luxurious and less crowded, not *all* trains are high-class with few people.
*   **B: Ditjeo tse lekanang tsa ditekete ka bobedi** - The passage states the fares are *slightly* more expensive, not equal.
*   **C: Maemo a mararo a fapaneng** - The passage only mentions two classes: MetroPlus and Metro.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe eo kokoanyana e ke keng ya e etsa?","The correct answer is **A: Ho baka makhopho (To cause bumps)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that animals can:

*   **Bodisa dijo:** Cause food spoilage
*   **Bake ho hlohlona:** Be venomous
*   **Re kudise:** Bite us
*   **Fetisetse tjhefu:** Transmit poison
*   **Fetisetse malwetsi:** Transmit diseases
*   **Lematsa kapa bolaya:** Injure or kill

While all the other options (B, C, and D) align with things a dangerous animal could *do* (cause sickness, infection, or wounds), causing ""bumps"" isn't explicitly mentioned and doesn't fit the severity of the other threats described. It's a less serious consequence than the others.

Therefore, the answer is **A**."
Dikarete tse nang le moya tsa difono di ka rekwa kae?,"The correct answer is **C: Mabenkeleng a manyane hukung ya meaho e meholo**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Lebenkele le leng le leng le leng sekgutlong le tletse ka letoto le ferekanyang la dikarete tsa mohala o lefellwang...""  This translates to ""Every corner shop in the city is filled with a wide range of prepaid phone cards..."".  ""Mabenkeleng a manyane hukung ya meaho e meholo"" means ""small shops in the basements of large buildings"" which is the closest equivalent to ""corner shops"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dinaheng tse itseng (Certain countries)** - The passage doesn't specify *where* the cards are bought, only that some offer better rates for specific countries.
* **B: Diemelong tsa diterene (Train stations)** - This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **D: Difonong tse patallwang tsa setjhaba (Public pay phones)** - The passage describes cards *for* phones, not places to buy them.



"
"Ditjeo tse bobebe tse fanwang ke dikarete tse ding, di ka fumaneha jwang?","The correct answer is **A: Di ka fumaneha dinaheng tse itseng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""tse ding si etseditswe ho fana ka ditheko tse molemo tsa ho letsa mohala dihlopheng tse itseng tsa dinaha."" This directly translates to ""some are designed to offer better rates for calling certain groups of countries.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dinomorong tse sa lefellweng** - While access to the services *is* often through a toll-free number, the *benefits* (better rates) are related to the destination country.
*   **C: Lebenkeleng le lenyane hukung ya meaho e meholo** - The passage mentions where you *buy* the cards, but not where the benefits are found.
*   **D: Ka ho sebedisa fono ya setjhaba e lefellwang le ho lefa ditjeo tse ding hape** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho difate tse latelang, ke sefe se sa fumaneheng habobebe setsing sa diphoofolo tse hlaha le dimela sa Plitvice Lakes?","The correct answer is **B: Leoka**.

Here's why:

The passage states the forests are dominated by beech, spruce, and fir. It specifically lists the *European brown bear, chamois, deer, wild boar, lynx, forest cat, and capercaillie* as animals found there.

Leoka (oak) is not mentioned as being present in the Plitvice Lakes National Park."
Ke mofuta ofe wa diphoofolo o sa fumaneheng habobebe setsing sa diphoofolo tse hlaha sa Pltitvice Lakes?,"The correct answer is **C: Cassowary**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically mentions ""capercaillie""** as one of the unusual animals found in Plitvice Lakes.
* **Turkey** can be found in Europe.
* **Honey Badgers** are also found in Europe.
* **Cassowaries** are native to Australia and New Guinea. They would *not* be found in Croatia (where Plitvice Lakes is located).

Therefore, the animal least likely to be found at Plitvice Lakes is the Cassowary.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, dinomoro tse ikhethang tsa dibaka tsa pele dinomorong tsa mehala di thusa jwang?","The correct answer is **D: Ho kopitsa ho seng molaong**.

Here's why:

The passage states the stated purpose of serial numbers (dikhamphani tsa metjha ya ditaba ka tlwaelo di bua leshano ka morero wa sena, di bolela hore ke ho “thibela boshodu”) is a false one. It argues the *real* purpose is to give companies control over the market (ke taba feela ya ho etsa tjhelete). It specifically says the serial numbers don't stop illegal copying (""dikhoutu tsa sebaka ha di na phello ho hang ho etseng kopi ho seng molaong"").

Therefore, the serial numbers *relate* to illegal copying, even if they don't prevent it.  The passage suggests they are a tool used in the context of managing or tracking copies.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang yeo eseng nnete ka dikhoutu tsa sebaka e tswelliswang pele ke ditsi tsa kgaso?","The correct answer is **D: Ke ka sewelo di thusang thibelong ya lekunutu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the *stated* purpose of region codes is ""to prevent piracy,"" but then argues that this is a false claim. It asserts the *real* purpose is to give companies market control and make money. 

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

* **A: Di bohlokwa bakeng sa ho fumana taolo e eketseileng ya di mmaraka** – The passage directly states this is the true purpose: ""...to give those companies power in their markets...""
* **B: Di thusa ho qoba ho qopitsa ho seng molaong** – The passage says this is the *claimed* purpose, but then immediately refutes it, saying they don't actually stop illegal copying.
* **C: Di thusa ho kenya tjhelete** – The passage states this is the ultimate goal: ""...it's simply about making money.""

The passage doesn't mention anything about privacy.  In fact, region coding could be seen as *reducing* user freedom and control, and thus indirectly impacting privacy. Therefore, option D is the one that's *not* supported by the provided text.



"
"Ha o fihla haeno, ke tshebetso efe e etswang ka mokhwa o bobebe?","The correct answer is **A: Ho hlahloba bojaki (Searching luggage)**.

Here's why:

The prompt describes a situation where people are subject to invasive searches upon entry. This directly relates to luggage inspections.  The other options are related to customs regulations, but not necessarily *abusive* practices.

* **B, C, & D** relate to declaring goods, limits on purchases, and duty/taxes – these are standard customs procedures, even if they can be inconvenient.
* **A** directly addresses the possibility of overly aggressive or illegal searches of personal belongings. The prompt warns about potentially exceeding legal limits, which is most relevant to luggage inspection.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke eng eo o lokelang ho e tseba pele o fihla haeno?","The correct answer is **D: Haeba o tlisa dintho tse sa dumellwang** (If you are bringing prohibited items).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes being aware of what you *can* and *cannot* bring, and avoiding anything that breaks the law. Option D directly addresses this. The passage warns about strict scrutiny and potential consequences for violations.

Let's look at why the other options are less directly related to the core warning:

*   **A:** While customs checks (tlhatlhobong ledibohong) are likely, the passage focuses on *what* is checked, not just *that* something is checked.
*   **B & C:** These options refer to declaring items and potential duties. While important, they don't address the fundamental issue of bringing *illegal* items, which is the main point of the passage's warning.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke bongata ba eng bo dumellang bahlwi ba dithaba ho dula ba fuamana ditsela tse ntjha kamehla?","The correct answer is **D: Mabota**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...continue to find new routes within endless walls."" This directly links the ability to *always* discover new routes to the presence of the walls themselves. The walls are what provide the routes and the endless possibilities for climbing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maikutlo (Feelings):** While climbers might *feel* excited, feelings don't cause new routes to appear.
*   **B: Ditlhoro (Peaks):** Peaks are mentioned as viewpoints, but they aren't what climbers are actively finding new routes *on*.
*   **C: Dibaka tse hodimo (Heights):** Heights are a characteristic of the valley, but not the *reason* for continuous discovery.



"
"Ho ipapisitswe le ditaba tse hlahang seratswaneng, ke khamphani efe e nang le dibaka tsa ho tshela tse ngata ka ho fetisisa Karolo e ka Borwa ya Lefatshe?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The text states that Star Alliance ""includes everything except Pacific South east from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti."" This means they cover the vast majority of Southern Hemisphere destinations.  While it notes a gap, it's still more comprehensive than the other options.

*   **SkyTeam** is explicitly stated to *not* include any Southern Hemisphere hubs.
*   **South Pacific** is not a specific airline alliance mentioned in the text.
*   **LATAM Oneworld** only operates *one* specific route (Santiago to Tahiti) and isn't a broad coverage network.



"
Ke bafufisi ba selekane sefe ba nkang karolo e nyane ho tsheleng lewatle la Karolo e ka Borwa ya Lefatshe?,"The correct answer is **D: Sky Team**.

Here's why:

The text states ""SkyTeam ha e akaretse sebakale ha e le sefe sa ho tshela"". This means SkyTeam has the smallest participation in Southern Hemisphere sea routes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Star Alliance:** The text says Star Alliance covers *almost* everything, making them a major player.
*   **B: South Pacific:** This isn't a carrier alliance, it's a geographic region.
*   **C: LATAM Oneworld:** While mentioned as a specific flight option, LATAM Oneworld isn't the alliance with the smallest participation overall.



"
Ke mokgatlo ofe wa maeto o atlehileng ho Global Running Tours?,"The correct answer is **B: Go Running Tours**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Global Running Tours...is led by Go Running Tours."" This indicates Go Running Tours is the central, overarching organization within the Global Running Tours network. While the others are mentioned as members or affiliates, Go Running Tours is presented as the leader.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, Go running Tours e thusa ho kopanya mekgatlo e mekae e thusang ho felehetsa baeti le ho ruta sebaka?","The correct answer is **B: 200**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dinaheng tsohle, ho na le ho e ka bang mekgatlo ya bohahlaudi e tsamaiswang e 200."" This translates to ""Worldwide, there are approximately 200 tour groups operating.""  The passage then explains Go Running Tours connects these groups to help tourists and educate them about the location.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nne (Four):** The passage mentions four cities (Barcelona, Copenhagen, Prague, and generally others), but it's referring to locations where the *companies* are based, not the number of tour groups connected.
*   **C: Tse ngata (Many):** While ""many"" isn't wrong, the passage gives a specific approximate number (200).
*   **D: Tharo (Three):**  Only three tour companies are explicitly named (Running Tours Barcelona, Running Copenhagen, and Running Tours Prague).



"
Bahahlaudi ba lokela ho etsa eng ha ba batla ho bonela lengau haufi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ho sebedisa ferekeikere (To use binoculars)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ditau, dichita, le dinkwe ka dinako tse ding di na le dihlong mme o ka di bona hantle ka **dibonela-hole**."" (Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes have dens and you can see them well with **binoculars**.)

Therefore, to get a closer look at lions, cheetahs, and leopards, a tourist should use binoculars.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mofuta ofe wa phoofolo oo moeti a ka kopanang le ona habobebe ha a tsamaya ka koloi?","The correct answer is **B: Dithuhlo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Diphoofolo tse ding, jwaloka **ditlou le dithuhlo**, di tlwaetse ho atamela haufi le dikoloi..."" (Other animals, like lions and **leopards**, are used to approaching near cars...).

The other options are mentioned, but not as animals commonly seen *close* to vehicles:

*   **Ditau (Lions)** are mentioned as approaching vehicles, but so are dithuhlo.
*   **Dinkwe (Wild dogs)** are mentioned, but only as being seen with binoculars due to distance.
*   **Mangau (Hyenas)** are not mentioned in the passage.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e ka fokotsang ditshenyehelo tsa leeto?","The correct answer is **B: Ho fumana sehlopha sa batho ba bane se o tsamayang le sona**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Maeto ha a bitse haholo bakeng sa dihlopha tse kgolo, kahoo haeba o le mong kapa o na le motswalle a le mong, leka ho kopana le batho ba bang mme le etse sehlopha sa batho ba e ka bang ba nne kapa ba tsheletseng bakeng sa theko e molemonyana ya motho ka bomong."" This means forming a group of around four to six people will lower the individual cost.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho tsamaya o le mong** - The passage suggests *avoiding* traveling alone due to the higher cost.
*   **C: Ho ya le motho e mong** - The passage says even traveling with one other person is expensive and suggests finding more people.
*   **D: Ho fumana sehlopha sa batho ba tsheletseng kapa ho feta** - While a larger group *can* reduce costs, the passage specifically mentions a group of ""e ka bang ba nne kapa ba tsheletseng"" (around four to six).



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang ya ka fumanang ditjeo hantle ka ho fitisisa tsa maeto a bohahlaudi?","The correct answer is **D: Sehlopha sa batho ba bahlano**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Maeto is expensive for individuals or pairs, and recommends forming a group of four to six people to get a lower per-person price. This indicates that larger groups (like a group of five) benefit from the reduced cost.  While the passage also mentions that groups are often put together to fill vehicles, the primary benefit discussed is the lower individual cost for groups.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e entseng hore sebaka sa St Francisco se tsebahale lefatsheng ka bophara?","The correct answer is **A: Boteng ba mefuta e mengata ya bonono le bophatlalatsi** (The representation in movies, television, books and popular culture).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ho bontshiwa ha yona mminong, dibaesekopong, dibukeng le ditsong tse ratwang ho thusitse ho etsa toropo le diemahale tsa yona di tsejwe lefatsheng ka bophara."" (Its portrayal in films, television, books and popular culture helped make the city and its landscapes world famous.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dibaka tsa dikopano tse boemong bo hodimo** (High-end convention facilities) - While San Francisco *has* these, the passage doesn't say they are the primary reason for its fame.
*   **C: Mefuta e fapaneng ya moruo** (Diverse economy) - The passage mentions this, but focuses on *how* it became famous, not just that it has a diverse economy.
*   **D: Tjhebahalo e khotsofatsang ya dijo tsa batho ba Asia** (Satisfactory availability of Asian food) - This is mentioned as a positive aspect of San Francisco, but not as the main reason for its global recognition.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke polelo efe e seng nnete ka San Francisco?","The correct answer is **D: Moruo o itshetlehile feela ka bohahlaudi**.

Here's why:

The text states San Francisco's economy is *diverse* and includes professional services, government, finance, retail, *and* tourism. It doesn't say tourism is the *only* component. The other options are all directly supported by the text:

* **A: E hlahelletse hangata dibukeng le dibaesekopong:**  The text says its representation in media has helped make it world-renowned.
* **B: Dijo tsa batho ba Asia di atile:** The text explicitly states it's a great place to find Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese food.
* **C: Di fumaneha haholo dihoteleng le ditsing tsa kopano:** The text mentions numerous high-end hotels and convention facilities.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mofuta ofe wa baeti o ke keng wa una molemo ditshebeletsong tsa maeto tsa ejente?","The correct answer is **B: Moeti ya tlwaetseng ho etsa dintho a sa rera** (A traveler who is used to doing things without planning).

Here's why:

The passage highlights that travel agents are beneficial for those who *need time to consider arrangements* and *organize things for their trip* (like visas). Someone who is used to doing things without planning wouldn't value these services. They prefer spontaneity, which isn't what a travel agent typically provides.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Moeti ya hlolwang ho etsa qeto hangata** (A traveler who struggles to make decisions) - Travel agents can *help* someone who struggles to make decisions by offering guidance.
*   **C: Moeti ya so fumane visa** (A traveler who doesn't have a visa) - The passage specifically states agents can *help with* visa arrangements.
*   **D: Moeti ya ratang ho lefella ditshebeletso tse sehlopha** (A traveler who likes to pay for group services) - Travel agents often *offer* package deals including transfers, etc., which cater to those wanting bundled services.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e sa bolelwang seratswaneng e le molemo wa ho lefella ho ejente ya maeto?","The correct answer is **A: Ditokomane tsa maeto tse tswang kapele** (Quick travel documents).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on logistical arrangements and peace of mind.** It highlights benefits like pre-booked accommodation, transfers, and assistance with things like visas.
* **The passage mentions help with ""nako ya ho nahanisisa ka tokisetso eo kapa ho lokisa dintho tse amang leeto la hao (mohlala, visa)""** which indirectly means they can assist with travel documents, but it doesn't state they deliver them *quickly*.  The primary benefit is *assistance* with the documents, not speedy delivery.
* **B: Ditjeo tse bobebe tsa dihoteleng (Better hotel rates)** is mentioned as travel agents often have deals with hotels.
* **C: Ditshebeletso tsohle e le sehlopha se ditjeo tse bobebe (All services at group rates)** is implied by the passage – they can package things together, often at a better price.
* **D: Ho bolokela motho sebaka (Booking places for people)** is directly stated – ""Ba ka kgona le ho ho behela sebaka"" (They can also reserve a space).

Therefore, quick travel documents are *not* explicitly stated as a benefit of using a travel agent in the provided text."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke sefe seo mananeo a ho fetolela mantswe puong e nngwe a sitwang ho se etsa?","The correct answer is **D: Ho fetolela dintho puong e nngwe ka 100% ka dinako tsohle**.

Here's why:

The text states that translations are often ""accurate (but occasionally awkward)"" and that the programs ""can still make mistakes."" This means they don't translate *perfectly* 100% of the time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho fetolela matshwao puong e nngwe** - The text explicitly states some programs can translate signs/symbols using a smartphone camera.
*   **B: Ho fetolela polelo yohle puong e nngwe** - The passage discusses the ability to translate entire texts.
*   **C: Ho fetolela mantswe a ngotsweng hodima dintho tse ka mehaleng ya letheka ya morarao** - This is not mentioned in the text.

"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e sa bakeng mophula wa lehlwa?","The correct answer is **A: Lehlwa le itswarellang**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where the issue is *getting* the ice to fall.  Ice that sticks (is self-adhering) is the *problem*, not a cause of the break.  The passage specifically states the ice is ""sticky"" and needs to be triggered to fall.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Batho** - The passage states people can *cause* the ice to fall (they can be the triggering event).
*   **C: Khanya ya letsatsi** - The passage says sunlight can *cause* the ice to fall.
*   **D: Ho khethea hwa lehlwa hodima le leng** - This is not the problem that is outlined in the passage.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe eo e leng mophula wa lehlwa?","The correct answer is **C: Lehlwa le le ngata meepeng e tibileng**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where ice builds up, but can only be held by a single ice crystal. The rest falls like an avalanche. The problem is the ice *sticks*, needing a trigger to fall. It states the ice buildup is significant (""lehlwa le le ngata""). The passage doesn’t talk about a lack of ice (B), just ice that’s stuck. Option A is describing a property of the ice, not the problem. D is inaccurate as the passage states people *can* trigger the fall, it's not that the ice isn't affected by people.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, sopho e etsoa ka dintho life?","The correct answer is **B: Ditlama le dinoko**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sejo sa k’heri ke sejo se entsweng ka **ditlama le dinoko**, hammoho le nama kapa meroho."" (Soup is a dish made with **lentils and beans**, together with meat or vegetables.)

While the text *also* mentions yogurt and coconut milk being used in different regions, lentils and beans are the *base* ingredients for the soup as described in the first sentence.



"
"Dibakeng tse ding, lebese la khokhonte le ka sebeliswa ho sebakeng sa ntho efe e etsang sopho?","The correct answer is **C: Yokate**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""In northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used."" This directly implies coconut milk is used *instead of* yogurt in certain regions. Yokate is another word for yogurt.



"
Hobaneng tsela e potolohang Dithaba tsa Transantarctic e lokela ho fihla sehlabeng?,"The correct answer is **B: Lehlwa le bokellaneng le kotsi**.

Here's why:

The passage states the South Pole Traverse is ""filled with crevasses"". These are dangerous cracks in the ice.  The route *around* the Transantarctic Mountains is taken to *avoid* these crevasses, reaching the plateau which is safer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Seteishene sa McMurdo se dula se kwetswe hangata** - The passage doesn't mention anything about the frequency of McMurdo Station being impacted.
*   **C: Diterekere tse etseditsweng hona ha di hlwahlwa** - While special vehicles are needed, the issue isn't them breaking down, it's navigating the dangerous terrain.
*   **D: Ho bobebe ho feta ho tsamaya le lewatleng la Ross** - The passage doesn't compare the difficulty of this route to travelling across the Ross Sea. It simply states it's longer.



"
"Tseleng ya South Pole Traverse, ke eng e tshwauweng ka difolakha?","The correct answer is **C: Di “crevasse” tse tletseng lehlwa**.

The passage states: ""E tletse lehlwa ka ho petsoha ho tlatsitsweng mme e tshwauwe ka difolaga."" This directly translates to ""It is filled with snow and overhung and marked by crevasses."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tsela ya McMurdo Station** - The passage says the traverse *starts* at McMurdo Station, but doesn't say the station itself is marked by crevasses.
*   **B: Diterekere tse hulang mafura** - These *use* the traverse, they aren't what marks it.
*   **D: Ditsela tse kotsi tse potolohang thaba** - While the route goes *around* mountains, the passage doesn’t say the path *around* the mountains is marked by crevasses.



"
Ke se fe se sa bolelwang seratswaneng seo bahahlaudi ba lokelang ho se ela hloko ha ba ntse ba ithuta dibaka hlwahlweng e ka Borwa ho Afrika?,"The correct answer is **A: Ditjhaba tse fapaneng di na le dipehelo tse fapananeng tsa visa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ditlhokahalo tsa visa le ditshenyehelo di fapana ho ya ka dinaha mme ho amuwa ke naha eo o tswang ho yona.""  This means visa requirements vary by country and depend on your nationality. This is a crucial detail for travelers to be aware of when planning a trip to Southern Africa.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** While true (the passage mentions this), it's a general statement *about* traveling and not a specific thing travelers *need to consider* when researching destinations.
*   **C:** The passage says South Africa doesn't have civil wars, but then *immediately* clarifies that *not all* countries in the region are the same. So this is a potentially misleading simplification.
*   **D:** The passage recommends 4x4s but doesn't say it's the *only* option, or that it's something one *must* consider in the research phase – it's more about what will give you greater access.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng se ka nkuwang e le keletso e fosahetseng ho bahahlaudi ba etelang hlwahlwa e ka Borwa ho Afrika?","The correct answer is **D: Hase dinaha tsohle tsa Afrika e Borwa tse hantle sebakeng sa ho tjhakelwa**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Hopola ha o ntse o rera hore le hoja Afrika e Borwa e se na merusu ha se dinaha tsohle tsa baahisani tse leng jwalo."" This means not all countries surrounding South Africa are safe for travel.  This is a crucial point for travelers to be aware of.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dintho tse ding tse ka thusang nakong ya tsietsi ka koloing di ya hlokahala ho latela molao** - The passage *supports* this statement; it mentions needing specific emergency items in the car depending on the country.
*   **B: Le ha koloi ya 4x4 e khothalletswa, dibaka tse ngata di ntse di fihleleha ka dikoloi tse tlwaehileng** - This is directly stated in the passage: ""Sena se ka etsahala koloing e tlwaelehileng haeba o hlophisa ka hloko"".
*   **C: Ho tsamaya ka koloi ho hantle bakeng sa batho ba ratang ho kheloha tsela e tlwaehileng** - The passage highlights that road tripping allows you to get *off* the beaten path (""ho fihla dibakeng tse kantle ho ditsela e tlwaelehileng ya bahahlaudi""), so this is the opposite of what the text suggests.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e sa bolelwang e ka ba kotsi ya ho siya mekotla ho se motho ya e shebileng?","The correct answer is **B: O ka ba motsamaisi wa dithethefatsi o sa tsebe** (You could become an unwitting drug mule).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly warns about being used as a drug mule.** It states you could find yourself used to transport drugs without your knowledge, leading to serious trouble.

Let's look at why the other options are less directly stated as dangers in the passage:

* **A: E ka nna ya utsuwa (It could be stolen):** While possible, the passage focuses on a far more serious consequence than theft.
* **C: Mekotla e ka fapanngwa le ya motho e mong (Bags could be swapped with someone else's):** This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **D: Ba boholong ba ka nka e le tshoso ya bomo (Authorities could take it as a bomb threat):** While the passage mentions bags attracting attention from authorities, it specifically links this to drug smuggling, not bomb threats.



"
Ke eng e sa bolelwang ka hara seratswana mabapi le ho tsamaya ka lithethefatsi?,"The correct answer is **A: Dinaheng tse ling, batho ba qalang ho tlola molao ba ka ahlolelwa lefu.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Dinaha tse ding di na le ditsela tsa ho otla tse sehloho haholo le bakeng sa ba qalang ho tlola molao; tsena di ka akarelletsa dikahlolo tsa tjhankane tsa dilemo tse fetang 10 kapa lefu."" This directly addresses the possibility of the death penalty for first-time offenders in some countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ho ba sedi ho hlwahlwa ha motho a etela mafatsheng a mang.** - The passage doesn't mention anything about being unlucky when traveling. It focuses on the *risk* of being used as a drug mule.
* **C: Dintja tse nkhellang dithethefatsi di ka sebediswa motho a sa elellwe.** - The passage *does* state this (""dintja tse fofonelang dithethefatsi di ka sebediswa nako efe kapa efe ntle le ho o tsebisa""), but it's *stated* in the passage, not *unsaid*. The question asks for what's *not* mentioned.
* **D: Ba boholong ba ka nna ba nka mekotla ya hao le ha o sa nka dithethefatsi.** - While the passage warns about leaving bags unattended because they attract attention, it doesn’t specify *who* might take them – just that they’ll be investigated.  It implies a risk related to drug smuggling, not just general theft.



"
Ke mofuta ofe wa dino o sa bolelwang oo motho a ka iketsetsang ona boikhathollong ba hae ba lehae?,"The correct answer is **B: Kofi**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""kofi e matla hoseng"" (strong coffee in the morning). It also talks about making something special when having time off at home, and coffee fits that description perfectly. While tea is mentioned (""tee ya chamomile""), the passage emphasizes *making* coffee as a home comfort.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Terenki (Brandy)** - Not mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Jwala (Beer)** - The passage suggests going to *bars* for alcoholic drinks, not making them at home.
*   **D: Tee (Tea)** - Tea is mentioned, but as a soothing bedtime drink, not something actively *made* for enjoyment like the coffee is described.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke sebaka sefe se o lokelang ho se etela boikhathollong ba hao ba lehae haeba toropo ya heno e tsebahala haholo ka ho nwa?","The correct answer is **C: Dibara tseo o sa di tlwaelang** (Bars you don't usually visit).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ha o dula toropong e na leng setso se fapa-fapaneng sa ho nwa, e ya dibareng kapa dintlung tsa jwala tse leng sebakeng sa heno tse o sa yeng ho tsona kgafetsa."" This directly suggests exploring local bars as part of the ""staycation"" experience in a city known for its drinking culture.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Dibaka tsa ho nwella kofi tse ka thoko ho moo o dulang** (Local coffee shops) - While the passage mentions coffee, it's not the focus of exploring local culture in a city known for drinking.
*   **B: Dibaka tse rekisang terinki kapa smoothie** (Places selling juice or smoothies) - The passage suggests these for when you're feeling unwell, not for cultural exploration.
*   **D: Dibaka tsa ho jela tse rekisang tee ya chamomile** (Restaurants selling chamomile tea) - Chamomile tea is mentioned as a relaxing bedtime drink, but doesn't relate to exploring the city's drinking culture.



"
Ditswantsho tse betlwilweng tsa maeba di hokae?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka jareteng ya kereke**.

The passage states: ""Ka lebaleng la kereke, ho na le dintshwantsho tse thahasellisang tsa mmabole tsa maeba hodimo ha mabitla a mang."" This directly translates to ""In the churchyard, there are interesting paintings of angels on top of some graves."" Therefore, the paintings are located in the churchyard."
Ke mofuta ofe wa visa o ka hlokang hore motho a fane ka bopaki ba tshehetso e lekaneng ya ditjhelete?,"The correct answer is **D: Visa ya baithuti (Student Visa)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Dinaheng tse ngata, o tla hloka ... bopaki ba tjhelete ba hore o tla tla kgona ho itjara bonyane selemo sa ho qala sa ho ithuta."" This directly links financial proof to student visas.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Visa ya kgwebo (Business Visa):** While business visas might *sometimes* require proof of funds, it's not a standard requirement like it is for student visas.
*   **B: Visa ya bohahlaudi (Tourist Visa):** Tourists generally need to demonstrate they can support themselves during their *visit*, but not necessarily for a long-term period of study.
*   **C: Visa ya nakwana (Transit Visa):** Transit visas are for passing *through* a country, not staying to study, and usually have minimal requirements.



"
Ke mamg ya ka bang monyetleng wa ho ekeletswa visa?,"The correct answer is **C: Moithuti wa matjhabeng** (International Student).

Here's why:

The passage specifically discusses the requirements for students studying abroad, including the need for a visa, proof of acceptance, and financial stability. The questions asks about who is likely to need a visa for a *longer* stay, and the text explains that students typically need visas for longer periods than tourists or business travelers.



"
O lokela ho ela menwang hloko haholo neng?,"The correct answer is **A: Nakong ya kgwedi tsa lehlabula** (During the summer months).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states ""Ka lehlabula, haholo-holo..."" (In the summer, especially...) and explains that you need to be aware of insects during that time. While insects can be present in other scenarios, the passage focuses on the summer months as the key time to be careful.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ha o hlwa dithaba** (When climbing mountains) - The passage doesn't mention mountains.
*   **C: Morung e mongobo** (In a muddy river) - While insects might be near muddy rivers, the passage focuses on the general summer season.
*   **D: Ha o kganna** (When driving) - The passage mentions driving *in* a muddy river, but the main point is about the summer months bringing insects.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng seo o lokelang ho qoba ho se etsa e le ho qoba menwang ka dibakeng tsa meru e mongobo ha o khanna?","The correct answer is **A: Ho tlohela mamati a koloi a butswe nako e telele haholo** (Leaving the car windows open for too long).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that even a *few moments* with the windows down while entering a swampy area is enough for leeches to get inside the car. This implies the importance of keeping windows closed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ho kganna nakong ya lehlabula** (Driving during the summer) - The passage mentions summer, but doesn't say driving *in* summer is the problem, only that you need to be careful about leeches.
*   **C: Ho kganna dibakeng tse tjhesang haholo** (Driving in very cold places) - The passage talks about swamps, not necessarily cold places.
*   **D: Ho tlohela koloi e sa lebelwa nakong yeo o ntseng o hlwa dithaba** (Leaving the car unattended while you are hiking) - The passage focuses specifically on entering the swampy area, not leaving the car unattended.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke polelo efe e seng ya nnete ka sebaka sa Sundarbans?","The correct answer is **C: Ke moru o moholo ka ho fetisisa lefatsheng**.

Here's why:

*   **The text states:** Disundarban di etsa sebaka se kabang 3,850 km² (covers an area of 3,850 km²). This doesn't imply it's the *largest* mangrove forest in the world, only its size.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: Se na le meru e meholo e seng mekae e setseng (It has a few large trees left):** The text states: “Meru hase fela mekgwabo ya difate tsa mangrove le hoja — di akarelletsa dikgwe tsa ho qetela tse setseng tse kileng tsa kwahela lehwatata la Gangetic.""
*   **B: Kakaretso ya halofo ya sona e kwahetswe ke mohlwa moo ho dulang ho na le metsi (About half of it is covered by water):**  The text states: ""eo karolo ya boraro ya yona e kwahetsweng ke dibaka tsa metsi/mokgoabo"" (one-third is covered by water/mudflats). This could be mistaken for half.
*   **D: Ke lehae la dikgama tse matheba ho feta nkwe ya Bengal (It is home to far more deer than Bengal tigers):**  The text mentions ""dikgama tse ka bang 30,000"" (around 30,000 deer) and ""dinkwe tsa Royal Bengal tse 400"" (400 Bengal tigers). Clearly, there are many more deer.



"
Ke karolo efe ya moru e ka hara sebaka sa MaIndia?,"The correct answer is **A: Sebaka sa poloko ya diphoofolo tse hlaha sa Sundarbans**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Karolo ya moru e leng sebakeng sa India e bitswa Sundarbans National Park.""  ""National Park"" translates to ""Sebaka sa poloko ya diphoofolo tse hlaha"" in this context.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sebaka sa polokeho ya diphoofolo tse hlaha le dimela:** While the Sundarbans *does* have plants (mangroves), the text doesn't emphasize a specific focus on both flora and fauna in the Indian section.
*   **C: Dibaka tsa botjhaba tsa lefatshe:** This refers to the UNESCO World Heritage Site designation, not the specific area within India.
*   **D: Thota e kgolohadi:** This isn't a precise translation of ""National Park"" and doesn't accurately reflect the nature of the protected area.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang ya ka bang monyetleng wa ho ba le kutlwisiso e fokolang ya Senyesemane?","The correct answer is **B: Batho ba banyenyane dilemong** (Young people).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...and in many others you can expect a reasonable proficiency – *especially amongst those who are not young*."" This directly implies that older people are *more* likely to have a good understanding of English.  Therefore, younger people are the ones most likely to have less understanding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Batho ba ka buang bonyane puo tse pedi** (People who speak at least two languages) - The passage doesn't suggest multilingual people have less English proficiency.
*   **C: Batho ba etelang Toronto** (People visiting Toronto) - The passage describes people *from* different places being in Toronto, not that visitors necessarily have poor English.
*   **D: Batho ba baholo** (Older people) - The passage specifically states older people are *more* likely to be proficient in English.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e ka bang thata ho bitseha?","The correct answer is **B: Diaterese**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Sena ke nnete haholo ka diaterese, tseo ho leng boima ho di bitsa hantle."" (This is especially true for dialects, which are difficult to pronounce correctly.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mantswe a medumo e ikgethang:** While some words with unique sounds might be difficult, the passage doesn't focus on this.
*   **C: Mantswe a ngotsweng:** The passage actually says written words are *easier* to understand than spoken ones.
*   **D: Puo e ikgethang ya sebaka:** The passage mentions different accents, but states that dialects are difficult to pronounce."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke maemo afe a loketseng moeti ya rerang ho palama bese seteisheneng sa ditereke?","The correct answer is **A: Moeti ya lebang Jakar a se a rekile tekete pele**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""hangata, haholo tse yang botjhabela le Jakar/Bumthang di tloha pakeng tsa 06:30 le 07:30.""  It *also* states: ""ho kgothalletswa ho reka tekete matsatsi a mmalwa esale pele.""  This strongly suggests a traveler going to Jakar (or Bumthang) should book in advance due to the buses being full.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Moeti ya lebang Bumthang a tlameha ho tsamaya ka ya 7** - The passage doesn't specify a particular bus time for Bumthang, only a range (06:30-07:30).
*   **C: Moeti ya lebang Paro a tlameha ho tsamaya ka mora 11** - The passage says Paro is a nearby destination served by combined buses and gives a price but doesn't mention a specific departure time.
*   **D: Moeti ya lebang botjhabela a fihla seteisheneng pele ho 6:20** - Buses to the east (including Jakar/Bumthang) leave *between* 06:30 and 07:30, so arriving before 6:20 isn't necessarily the key point. The important thing is to be there within that time window *and* potentially have a ticket already.



"
Ke eng e ka bang keletso e ntle ho mohahlaudi ya shebileng ho etela botjhabela a tloha seteisheneng sa dibese tsa setereke?,"The correct answer is **B: Ho reka tekete pele ho nako ya leeto**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jwalokaha dibese tse bohareng ba ditereke tse pedi hanata di dula di tletse, ho kgothalletswa ho reka tekete matsatsi a mmalwa esale pele."" This directly translates to ""As the buses in the central districts are often full, it is recommended to purchase tickets a few days in advance.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dibese di tsamaya feela ka mora 8:30** - The passage says buses *often* leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
*   **C: Dibese tse ngata di tsamaya letsatsi lohle** - While buses run all day, the passage specifically notes earlier departures for eastern routes.
*   **D: Tekesi e kopanetsweng e ka nna ya ba mokhwa o nepahetseng ka ho fetisisa wa ho tsamaya** - Shared taxis are mentioned as a good option for *nearby* places like Paro and Punakha, but not necessarily the best for going east from the district bus station.



"
Ho tse latelang ke eng e sa hlaloseng ka nepo tlhaloso ya Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **A: E na le tshusumetso e ngata ya Maarabo ho feta dibaka tsohle kahara naha**.

Here's why:

The passage states Timbuktu is *more* influenced by Arabic culture than African culture, but it **doesn't** say it has more Arabic influence than *all* places within the country. It only makes a comparison to other cities, not to the entire nation.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

*   **B: E hlasetswe ke bofutsana** - The passage explicitly states Timbuktu is a dilapidated town.
*   **C: Ha e fihlellehe ka sefofane** - The passage states it has an airport.
*   **D: E hohela bahahlaudi ba ratang ho ithuta dibaka tse ntjha** - The passage says it is a popular tourist destination because of its fame.



"
Ke ntlha efe e nepahetseng ka Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **A: Toropo e fihlellehang ka sefofane**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Kajeno, Timbuktu ke toropo e futsanehileng, le hoja botumo ba yona bo e etsa e ratwe ke bahahlaudi, mme e na le boema-fofane."" (Today, Timbuktu is a remote city, but its fame makes it popular with tourists, and it has an airport.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ha e a tlwaeleha ho feta ho futsaneha:** The passage states it *is* remote (""futsanehileng"").
* **C: E na le bokgabane bo fokolang ba Seafrika ho feta ditoropo tse e potileng:** The passage says it's more influenced by Arabic culture than African culture, meaning it *does* differ from surrounding areas in that regard.
* **D: Toropo ha e sa kgahla bahahlaudi:** The passage specifically states it *is* popular with tourists (""e ratwe ke bahahlaudi"").



"
Diolimpiki tsa hlabula di ne di behetswe ho ba neng? ,"The correct answer is **A: Phato selemong sa 2021**.

The text states: ""Diparalimpiki di tla etsahala ho tloha ka 24 August ho ya ho 5 September 2021."" (The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021). While the text discusses the Olympics being *originally* scheduled for July 2020, the question asks about when they *were* held, and the passage clearly states August/September 2021 for the Paralympics (which follow the Olympics).
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke boemong bofe boo fanele e bang lehodiotswana?","The correct answer is **B: Ha meya e theosang e qalella ho bidika**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Se qala joaloka difanele tse theohang ho tswa marung a sefefo..."" This directly translates to ""It begins like descending funnels from the cloud base...""  This is the initial stage, before it becomes a full-blown ""powerful wind"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ha sekhahla sa meya e ba dimaele tse 100 ka hora:** While the passage mentions wind speed, it doesn't say this is *when* the funnel begins. It states that this is a characteristic *of* the tornado.
*   **C: Ha e tloha sefefong sa maru:** The funnel *starts* from the cloud base, not after leaving it.
*   **D: Ha e qeta ho fihla fatshe:** The passage says it *becomes* ""powerful winds"" when it reaches the ground - the funnel is already present before it reaches the ground.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e nepahetseng ka tshobotsi ya lehodiotswana?","The correct answer is **D: Di spinning column tse suthumelletsag moya kantle**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a tornado as a rotating column of air.** The description of air spiraling inward and upward, lifting heavy objects, and starting as a visible funnel aligns perfectly with this.  ""Spinning column tse suthumelletsag moya kantle"" (spinning columns pushing air outwards) accurately reflects this rotational movement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Le dula le fehla meya e pakeng tsa dimaele tse 100-200 ka hora:** While the passage *states* tornadoes can have winds of 100-200 mph, it doesn't say they *always* do. Some are weaker.
* **B: Hangata le tsamaya le dintho tse boima:**  Tornadoes *can* lift heavy objects, but that's a *result* of the tornado, not a defining characteristic.  The passage describes lifting as something they *do*, not something they *always have*.
* **C: Le fetoha fanele ka mora ho fihla fatshe:**  The passage states the tornado *starts* as a funnel and becomes a ""powerful tornado"" when it reaches the ground - it doesn't *become* a funnel *after* reaching the ground.

"Ho latela seratswana, ke hokae moo moeti a lokelang ho fumana keletso mabapi le maemo a sepolotiki teropong a yang ho yona?","The correct answer is **C: Ho baahi ba naha eo a tle be a e etetse**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""you may want to seek advice from nationals of other countries besides your own... Advice however is only a snapshot of the political situation in one country. Opinions are often written, commonplace and greatly generalized when compared to detailed information available locally."" 

This directly implies getting information from *nationals of the country you are visiting* is preferable because they have the most detailed and relevant information.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mmusong wa naha eo a tle be a e etetse (The government of the country being visited):** While governments may offer travel advisories, the passage emphasizes getting advice from *nationals* as more detailed.
*   **B: Maikutlong a fanweng ke ditsebi tsa maeto (Opinions provided by travel experts):**  The passage suggests opinions (even expert ones) are often too generalized.
*   **D: Mmusong wa naha ya habo (The government of your home country):** The passage specifically says to consider advice from countries *besides your own* as it may not apply to your specific situation (e.g., an American in the Middle East)."
"Maemong ao moeti a eleditsweng ke ditsebi tsa ditaba tsa maeto, ke mathata afe ao moeti a hlahang kantle a ke keng a kopana le ona?","The correct answer is **B: Ditaba tse ngotsweng eka li bobebe mabapi le maemo a dipolotiki a naha**.

Here's why:

The passage states that news reports are often just opinions, generalized, and less detailed than information available on the ground.  The passage specifically warns against relying solely on these reports for understanding a country's political situation.  The passage implies that someone following travel advisories may encounter situations *different* from what's portrayed in simplified news reports.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dienshorense tse hlakotsweng (Cancelled insurance):** The passage explicitly states that travel insurance *can* be affected by travel warnings.
* **C: Inshorense ya bophelo bo botle (Health insurance):** The passage mentions travel health insurance as something you might need, so it’s not a problem you'd avoid.
* **D: Tlhahisoleseding e hlakileng mabapi le maemo a dipolotiki a naha (Clear information about a country's political situation):** The passage warns that detailed information is hard to come by, and that what you get from news sources is often *not* clear.

"Ho latela seratswana, ke mofuta ofe wa leeto o monyetleng o tlase haholo wa ho batla thuso ya ho lefella leeto, ho ejente ea maeto?","The correct answer is **B: Leeto la dibeke tse pedi ka bajete e itseng.**

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agents are a good choice for trips ""exceeding the traveller’s previous simple nature, culture, language or small-budget country trips."" This implies a trip with a specific budget is a good fit for a travel agent's expertise. 

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Leeto la ho ya sebokeng sa ditaba tsa mosebetsi toropong eo moeti a seng ile a e etela pele** – This sounds like a relatively straightforward business trip, not necessarily needing a travel agent.
* **C: Leeto le tla tlisa ho se utlwane ka puo** –  This highlights a need for navigating a language barrier, which is a specific challenge, but doesn't necessarily require a travel agent (language learning resources exist).
* **D: Leeto la moeti la pele la ho ya mose ho mawatle** – While a first-time cruise might benefit from an agent, the passage specifically mentions needing help beyond *simple* trips, and a cruise is often pre-packaged.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke maemong afe ao moeti a ka unang molemo ha a thuswa ke ejente ya ditaba tsa maeto?","The correct answer is **B: Ha moeti a na le thahasello ya leeto la boithabiso ka sehlopha lekgetlo la pele**.

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agents are particularly helpful for specific types of trips, and those often include trips focusing on nature, culture, language, or countries with less funding. A first-time group tour focusing on these elements aligns perfectly with the services a travel agent provides.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't specifically mention help with just flight bookings.
*   **C:** Knowing the local language would *reduce* the need for an agent.
*   **D:** While an agent could help, the passage doesn't highlight this as a primary benefit. It emphasizes agents specializing in certain trip types.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e ka thusang moeti ho qoba ho se khotsofale ha etetse dibaka tse ntjha?","The correct answer is **A: Ho lebella maemo a tshwanang le a moo a tswang**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Lebella hore dintho di ke ke tsa tshwana le “hae”. Mekgwa, melao, dijo, sephethephethe, bodulo, ditekanyetso, puo jwalo jwalo ho tla fapana ka tsela e itseng le moo o dulang teng.""  This means anticipating differences is key to avoiding dissatisfaction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** Trying new foods is a positive aspect of travel, but doesn't *prevent* dissatisfaction.
*   **C:** The passage stresses differences in laws and customs, meaning respecting *different* laws, not the same ones.
*   **D:**  While research is good, the passage doesn't focus on avoiding research; it focuses on preparing for differences.



"
"Ho latela ditaba tse seratswaneng, ke mofuta ofe wa batho o ka nnang wa se khotsofale ha o etela sebaka se kantle ho naha?","The correct answer is **C: Motho ya sa rateng maikutlo a fapaneng (Someone who doesn't like different feelings)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes being prepared for things to be *different* and avoiding discomfort from those differences.  Someone who dislikes different feelings or experiences would be the most likely to be dissatisfied when faced with a new culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Motho ya ratang dijo tse sa tlwaelehang (Someone who likes unusual food)** - Liking unusual food is a positive trait for travel, not a source of dissatisfaction.
* **B: Motho ya ratang diphetoho (Someone who likes change)** - This person would likely *enjoy* visiting a new place.
* **D: Motho ya ratang ho ithuta (Someone who likes to learn)** -  A learner would also likely have a positive experience traveling.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke keletso efe e sa khothalletsweng moeti ya etelang naha e ntseng e thuthuha?","The correct answer is **B: Ho qoba ho ja haholo ydijo matsatsing a hao a pele**.

Here's why:

The passage *recommends* spending more money on higher quality hotels, food, and services to help adjust to a new environment. It doesn't suggest avoiding good food, but rather using it as a comfort and way to ease into the experience.

Let's look at why the other options *are* recommended:

*   **A: Ho tseba ka mefuta yohle ya diphoofolo tse teng moo pele o robala naheng** – The passage explicitly warns against sleeping on the ground where you don't know the local animals.
*   **C: Mofuta wa bethe ya boikhathollo wa “cot” kapa “hammock” o a khothalletswa bakeng sa khempa** – The passage recommends using a cot or hammock when camping to avoid insects and other creatures.
*   **D: Ho ba le tjhelete e lekaneng ya hotele ya maemo a hodimo ha a qala ho fihla** – This is directly stated as a way to help adjust to the new location.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e sa bolelwang e le eo motho a ka e etsang ho feta tekano ha a tlwaela sebaka dinaheng tse thuthuhang?","The correct answer is **A: Ho ja dijo tse phehuweng ka mokgwa wa dinaha tsa bophirima (Eating food prepared in Western styles)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly advises spending more money on Western-style hotels, food, and services *to help you adjust*.  It doesn't say *overdoing* this is a problem. In fact, it suggests it's a good strategy.

The other options are all things the passage recommends *doing* to stay safe and comfortable:

*   **B: Ho batla ditshebeletso tsa maemo a hodimo (Seeking high-end services)** -  Directly advised.
*   **C: Meterase kapa mmete sebakeng sa ho khempa (Mattress or cot while camping)** - Specifically recommended to avoid ground-dwelling creatures.
*   **D: Hotele tsa maemo a hodimo (High-end hotels)** -  Directly advised.

The passage implies that immersing yourself in the local culture (which would include local cuisine) is something to be careful with and avoid rushing into, but it doesn't say *overeating* Western food is a mistake."
"Ke efe ho tse latelang e ka bang molemo ka ho fetisisa bakeng sa motho ya nkileng sehlahiswa sa inshorense, ha a batla ho bona kopi ya sona ore hna e jwang empa a se na marang-rang?","The correct answer is **A: Ho fa motho yeo a tsamayang le yena kopi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Hape fana ka dikopi tsa polisi/dintlha tsa ho ikopanya ho batho bao o nkang leeto le bona..."" (Also give copies of policies/contact details to people you are travelling with...).
* The question asks about a situation *without* internet access. 
* Option C (laptop) relies on the laptop being accessible and working, and is a good second choice, but giving a copy to a travel companion is the most directly recommended solution in the text.
* Options B and D both require internet access, which the question states is unavailable.

Therefore, providing a copy to a travel companion is the most practical and directly suggested solution in the given text."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng ho tse latelang e sa lokelang ho hlaha sehlahisweng sa inshorense?","The correct answer is **D: Aterese ya tswibila ya monga sehlaiswa**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically asks for copies of your insurance *policy* and *contact details*. While the policy would likely contain your address, it doesn't ask for the address of the insured vehicle/property (monga sehlaiswa). 

The passage *does* request international phone numbers for claims/authorization, so A and C are mentioned. B (insurance mail address) would be part of the policy details.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke saese efe ya mofuta wa “negative” wa difoto o bontshang mofuta wa filmi o sebediswang hangata?","The correct answer is **C: 35 mm negative**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Filimi e tlwaelehileng ya 35 mm (negative ya 36 e pheta-phetilweng ka 24 mm) ke yona e tummeng haholo."" This directly indicates that the 35mm negative is the most commonly used film type.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 6x6 cm negative:** While mentioned, the text says it's used in medium format cameras, not that it's the most common.
*   **B: 56x56 mm negative:** This is a precise measurement related to the 6x6 format, but not what the text highlights as most common.
*   **D: 36x24 mm negative:** This is the *size* of the 35mm negative, but the question asks for the *type* of negative, and ""35mm negative"" is the type."
Ke dibopeho dife tsa filimi tse fanang ka boleng bo tshwanang le ba khamera ya mofuta wa DSLR?,"The correct answer is **A: Filimi ya 35mm**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Filimi e tlwaelehileng ya 35 mm...e fana ka ponahalo e lekanyetswang ho se le teng ho DSLR."" This directly links 35mm film to a similar appearance as a DSLR.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Filimi ya sebopeho se mahareng:** The text describes medium format cameras, but doesn't say their appearance is *like* a DSLR, just that they're different.
*   **C: Filimi ya 56×56 mm:** This is the negative size *within* a medium format camera, not a format directly comparable to DSLR.
*   **D: Filimi ya 6×6cm:**  Similar to C, this defines a medium format, but doesn't equate to DSLR appearance.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e ka bang mohato wa ho qetela wa ho qala kgwebo ya ho ngola ka tsa maeto?","The correct answer is **C: Haha webosaete ya hao**.

Here's why:

The passage states that once you're comfortable with formatting and editing online, you can *design your own website*. This implies that designing/building your website is the final step after getting comfortable with the technical aspects of online writing and formatting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ikwetlisetse ho fomata ka webosaete** - This is a step *before* designing your website.
*   **B: Ngola dihlooho tse mmalwa mabolokong a tsebahalang a maeto** - While good practice, this isn't presented as the *final* step in the passage.
*   **D: Ntlafatsa tsebo ya hao ya ho hlophisa** - Similar to formatting, this is a skill to develop *before* building the website.



"
"Ha o qala khwebo ea ho ngola ka tsa maeto, ke tsebo efe ho tse latelang e lokelang ho matlafatswa pele?","The correct answer is **A: Ho ngola kamokhwa wa blog (Blog Writing)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the easiest way to start a travel writing career is to *improve your skills on an established travel blog*. This implies that the foundational skill needed is actually *writing* travel content for a blog.  Formatting a website (B), editing (C), and building a website (D) are important, but they come *after* you're comfortable creating content. You need something *to* put on the website!

The passage specifically says once you're used to writing and editing online, *then* you can consider building your own website.  Therefore, writing is the first skill to focus on.



"
Ke maemong afe a lehodimo ao bohloko ba mala bo fumahalang haholo?,"The correct answer is **C: Maemo a lehodimo a tjhesang**.

The passage specifically states: ""Jwalo ka mathata a amanang le ho hema dibakeng tse batang, mathata a ka maleng dibakeng tse tjhesang a tlwaelehile haholo..."" (Just as breathing problems are common in cold places, digestive problems in cold climates are very common...).

Therefore, cold climates are where digestive issues are most frequently found."
"Ho latela seratswana, ho pepeseha kgafetsa ho ka thusa boitshereletso kgahlanong le eng?","The correct answer is **B: Dikokwana-hloko tsa lehae**.

The passage states: ""Hae, ka lebaka la ho pepesetseha kgafetsa ho dikokwana-hloko tsa sebakeng, ho na le menyetla ya hore o se ntse o kgona ho itshireletsa ho tsona."" This directly indicates that frequent exposure to local germs builds immunity to them.
"
"Ho tse latelang, ke molemo ofe wa ho tsamaya ka hara sebaka sa Schengen?","The correct answer is **A: Ho qoba dikopo tse ngata tsa visa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ka ho tshwanang, ka ho ba le visa ya Schengen, ha ho hlokahale hore o ngodisetse di-visa bakeng sa dinaha tsohle tsa Schengen ka ho fapana..."" This directly translates to avoiding multiple visa applications.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ho boloka tjhelete:** While avoiding visas *can* save money, the passage primarily highlights the convenience of avoiding the *applications* themselves.
* **C: Ho qoba dibaka tse ngata tsa ho hlahloba bukana ya ho eta:** The passage mentions avoiding repeated passport checks, but the main benefit is regarding visas, not just entry checks.
* **D: Ha ho hlokahale bukana ya ho eta:** The passage doesn't state you don't need a passport, just that you're not repeatedly checked when *within* the Schengen area.



"
Ke eng e kekeng ya hlola e fumanwa lebitleng la Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **D: Maruo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maruo a makatsang a lebitla ha sa leyo ho lona, empa a tlositswe a yiswa Musiamo ya Egepeta e leng Cairo."" This directly indicates that the fascinating artifacts were removed and taken to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mokgabiso** - The passage mentions furnishings were limited.
*   **B: Hlooho ya setopo se bolokilweng hore se bole** - The passage mentions the head and feet were visible after attempts to open the tomb, but does not say they were found *inside* the tomb.
*   **C: Mahetla a setopo se bolokilweng hore se bole** - Similar to B, the passage indicates they were visible during attempted opening, not a finding *within* the tomb.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke sebaka sefe sa teropo ya Vancouver se ke keng sa khahla haholo ho baeti ba sedi ka ditjeo? ","The correct answer is **A: Sehlekehleke sa Granville**.

Here's why:

The passage states that you *take a ferry from Granville Island to get to Bowen Island*. This implies Granville Island is a point of departure, not a destination that would particularly attract tourists in itself. The passage focuses on the appeal of Bowen Island, the Sea to Sky route, and Whistler as destinations.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Phaseje ya The Sea to Sky:** The passage explicitly states this route is ""essential"" for those who enjoy outdoor activities.
*   **C: Sehlekehleke sa Bowen:** The passage describes Bowen Island as a desirable destination for day trips and weekend getaways.
*   **D: Whistler:** The passage highlights Whistler's popularity, especially due to the 2010 Winter Olympics, and lists many activities available there."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke sebaka sefe se nang le bokhoni ba ho fa moeti phihlelo ya nnete ya ho etela Vancouver?","The correct answer is **A: Sehlekehleke sa Bowen**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Sehlekehleke sa Bowen is a ""charming day trip or weekend getaway"" *from* Vancouver and is easily accessible *to* Vancouver. It is described as being *in* Howe Sound, near Vancouver, making it a place to experience the area *around* Vancouver. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Whistler:** While mentioned, Whistler is described as being a 1.5-hour drive *from* Vancouver, implying it's not directly within or a close extension of the Vancouver experience itself.
*   **C: Mahareng a toropong ya Vancouver:** The text doesn't emphasize exploring the city center as a unique experience.
*   **D: Sehlekehleke sa Granville:** The passage mentions Granville Island as a point of departure *from* (ferry terminal), but not as a destination for experiencing Vancouver.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, baeti ba lokela bo etela Phororong neng haeba ba re ba batla ho e boha ho se se ba tshirang?","The correct answer is **D: Nako ya selemo eo pula e sa neng** (The time of year when it is not raining).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the water level is highest and the falls are most powerful during the rainy season (November to March) and warns about getting soaked.  Therefore, to avoid being drenched, visitors should go when it *isn't* raining, which is the dry season. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho tloha ka Pudungwana ho fihlela Tlhakubele (From May to August):** While this is likely part of the dry season, the passage doesn't specifically mention these months.
*   **B: Nakong eo bahahlaudi ba etang ka bongata (When tourists are most numerous):**  The passage indicates that Victoria Falls attracts a wide range of tourists year-round, not just during a specific time.
*   **C: Ha metsi a le mangata (When the water is high):** The passage directly advises *against* visiting when the water is high due to the risk of getting soaked.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke bothata bofe boo motho a ka kopanang le bona ha etela phororo ya Victoria Falls dipakeng tsa Pudungwana le Tlhakubele?","The correct answer is **A: Dibaka tse khahlang tsa Phororo tse sa sirwang ke letho**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""O netefatswa hore o tla koloba ha o feta borokgo kapa o tsamaya ditselaneng tse haufi le Diphororo."" This directly means that walkways or paths near the falls can be flooded during the rainy season (November to March), making them dangerous and unusable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bahahlaudi ba fokolang:** The text says it's a *popular* tourist destination.
*   **C: Tjhebahalo e sa tlwaelehang ya Phororo:** The text mentions the falls being very strong during the rainy season, but not that they're unpredictable.
*   **D: Ho qoba nako ya selemo eo pula e nang:** The text *describes* what happens during the rainy season, it doesn't suggest avoiding it. In fact, it suggests being *aware* of the dangers if you visit during that time.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e sa khothalletsweng ha motho a sebedisa khamera e fofang?","The correct answer is **A: Ho sheba pele hore na o dumelletswe ho nka ditswantswo moo**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Haeba u sebedisa drone, hlahloba hantle esale pele hore na o dumellwa ho filima eng..."" This directly advises checking for permission *before* flying and filming. The passage also warns against filming anything illegal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ho fumana tumello e nngwe** - The passage *encourages* getting permission.
*   **C: Ho etsa dipatlisiso ka mangolo a tumello** - This is a part of checking for permission, and is therefore also encouraged.
*   **D: Ho nka ditshwantshwo feela dibakeng tseo batho ba bangata moo khamera e fofang e ke keng ya bonahala habobebe** - While avoiding unwanted attention is reasonable, the passage focuses on *legal* permission, not simply discretion.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke dibaka dife tsa mantlha tseo motho a ka sebedisang khamera e fofang?","The correct answer is **D: Dibakeng tseo o fumaneng tumello pele** (Places where you have obtained permission beforehand).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states, ""Haeba u sebedisa drone, hlahloba hantle esale pele hore na o dumellwa ho filima eng..."" (If you use a drone, carefully check beforehand whether you are allowed to film what...). This emphasizes the *need for permission* before operating a flying camera (drone) in any location.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn’t mention avoiding disturbing people, but rather respecting laws and permissions.
*   **B:** The passage warns *against* filming in places where it's not allowed, but doesn’t suggest those are places to use a camera.
*   **C:** The passage doesn’t mention the need for the camera to be hidden or discreet.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke polelo efe mabapi le dipehelo tsa ho ngodisa “visa” eo eseng nnete?","The correct answer is **B: Dinaha kaofela di hloka hore ho ngodiswe le ba boholong**.

Here's why:

The passage states that in *some* countries, you need to register, and specifically mentions that *some* countries only require non-hotel residents to register. It does **not** say all countries require registration for everyone.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Haeba o dula matlong a boroko a bahahlaudi ha o wa lokela ho ngodisa** - The passage explicitly states that in some cases, only those *not* staying in hotels need to register.
*   **C: Ho etela dikantoro tsa bojaki ho ka hlokahala** - The passage says visiting immigration offices in some countries might be necessary.
*   **D: Dibakeng tse ding, dihotele tsa lehae di ka etsa ngodiso** - The passage states that hotels often handle registration in many countries.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke sebaka sefe seo mohahlaudi a ke keng a ya ho sona sebakeng sa ngodiso?","The correct answer is **C: Posong ya lehae (The local post office)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions that registration typically involves registering with **local authorities (balaodi ba sebaka)**, **local police (mapolesa a sebakeng)**, or **hotels (dihotele tsa sebaka)**. It also states hotels often handle registration.

The passage *doesn't* mention the post office as a registration location.

Therefore, the post office is the place a tourist would *not* go to register.



"
Ke mang a ke keng a una molemo wa ho ithaopa ha etile?,"The correct answer is **B: Motho ya shebileng mokgolo o toma** (Someone who is only looking for a big profit).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that volunteering isn't *just* about giving, but about personal growth, cultural understanding, and self-discovery.  It specifically points out that many volunteer opportunities don't offer high pay, and may only cover room and board.

Someone motivated *solely* by profit (mokgolo o toma) would be disappointed and likely wouldn't benefit from the experience because it wouldn't meet their expectations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Motho ya tshepang hore o tla etsa bakhotsi ba batjha mose ho mawatle** (Someone hoping to make new friends abroad) - This aligns with the passage, as meeting new people is a benefit.
*   **C: Motho ya tshepileng ho fumana tsebo e ntjha** (Someone hoping to gain new knowledge) -  This is also a positive motivation mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Motho ya ka bang le thahasello ya ho fumana dijo le boroko tsa mahala** (Someone interested in free food and accommodation) - While the passage mentions these are often provided, it's not presented as the primary benefit, and isn't necessarily negative.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, boithaopo bo ka thusa moeti ya mose ho mawatle ya nkileng tjhelete e lekaneng jwang?","The correct answer is **B: Hanagata bo lebisa ho menyetla aa mesebetsi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...e ka boela ya ba tsela e ntle ya ho sebedisa tjhelete hamolemo ho dumela ho dula nako e teletsana sebakeng se seng ka ha mesebetsi e mengata ya boithaopo e fana ka kamore le bodulo mme e mmalwa e lefa moputso o monyenyane."" 

This translates to: ""...it can also be a good way to use money wisely by allowing you to stay longer in one place because many volunteer jobs offer room and board and some even pay a small allowance.""

This directly shows that volunteering can help someone stretch their money further by covering costs like accommodation and sometimes even providing a small income.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mokholo o batla o fanwa** - The passage mentions a small *allowance* sometimes, not a significant salary.
*   **C: Dijo le boroko di ya fanwa ka dinako tse ding** - While room and board are mentioned (essentially food and lodging), it's not the core way volunteering helps with finances.
*   **D: Bo ka thusa motho ho ba le maikutlwo a hlaphohetsweng** -  The passage *does* mention personal growth, but it's not the answer to how volunteering helps with limited funds.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke ntho efe e nkuwang e tlwaelehile ho maeto a mmalwa a ho ya Walt Disney World?","The correct answer is **C: Ho qeta nako yohle ya leeto sebakeng sa Disney**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ho qeta nako e ka bang beke o sa tswe sebakeng sa Disney, le ho kgutlela hae."" This directly describes spending the majority of the trip within the Disney area as part of the ""typical"" experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't specifically state that a week is spent *at attractions*, just in the Disney area.
*   **B:** The passage only mentions a Disney hotel, not necessarily a *luxury* hotel.
*   **D:** While taking a bus from the airport to the hotel is mentioned, it's just *part* of the trip, not the defining characteristic of a ""typical"" Disney World visit."
"Ho tse latelang, ke polelo efe ka Walt Disney World eo eseng nnete?","The correct answer is **A: Ditekete tse kenang dibakeng tsohle tsa moo, tsa boikgathollo di ka fitisetswa ho baeti ba bang.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""ditekete ha di fetisetswe ho ba bang."" (Tickets are not transferred to others.) Therefore, the statement that tickets can be transferred is **false**.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

*   **B: Matlo a bodulo a fumaneha moo** – The passage mentions hotels at Disney (""ho palama bese e yang hoteleng e Disney"").
*   **C: Dibese di ya fumaneha ho lata baeiti boemafofane di ba isa sebakeng seo** – The passage mentions flying into Orlando International Airport and then taking transportation to the Disney hotel.
*   **D: Ditekete tsa matsatsi a mangata di ka fumaneha ho marangrang a fantisi** – The passage states that many tickets are bought and sold online on sites like eBay and Craigslist.

"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e ka nnang ya ba ha ya kenella boithutong bo porofeshenale le dingolilweng?","The correct answer is **C: Ho ba malalaotswe ha sebaka sa ntwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states a person *planning to visit a country considered a war zone* needs professional training. The training will involve practical exercises, first aid, and potentially weapon handling.  Being disoriented or lost in a war zone is a very real and dangerous possibility, making knowledge of the environment and survival skills crucial.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Ho hlola diqholotso tsa lefelleng (Surviving wilderness challenges):** While wilderness survival skills are mentioned as being found in books, the focus is specifically on war zones.
* **B: Ho bona ho re ditshebeletso tsa thuso ya pele di dula di le malala-a laotswe (Seeing that first aid services are consistently understaffed):** The passage mentions first aid *as part of the training*, not as a problem to be observed.
* **D: Tshwantsiso ya se ka etsahalang (Simulation of what might happen):**  The passage says the training *often involves doing things in practice*, but doesn't suggest simulation as a key outcome to be aware of.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e kekeng ya nkwa e le keletso e nepahetseng bakeng sa ho bapala korostina hantle?","The correct answer is **B: Boloka ho sisinyeha ho sa hlokahaleng bonyane e le hore u boloke matla a hao**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Tiisa hore letsoho la hao le phutholohile kahohle kamoo ho ka kgonehang empa o ntse o tidinya dinoto tsohle ka nepo - hape o leke ho se etsa motsamao o bontshang boikitlaetso ka menwana ya hao. Ka tsela ena o ke ke wa ikutlwa o kgathetse haholo."" This directly translates to minimizing unnecessary movement to avoid fatigue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage says you *don't* need to press keys harder for louder sound.
*   **C:** While it mentions pressing keys, the emphasis isn't on carefully pressing, but on keeping the hand relaxed.
*   **D:** The passage mentions bellows control for volume, not speeding up key presses.



"
"Ha u bapala korostina, ke efe ho tse latelang e tla thusa ho eketsa modumo?","The correct answer is **A: Lebelo le eketsehileng**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...hore o eketse modumo, o sebedisa di-bellow ka ho di hatella kapa ka ho phahamisa **lebelo**."" ( ""...to increase the volume, you operate the bellows by pressing them or increasing the **speed**."")

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Matla a eketsehileng** - While pressing the bellows does increase volume, the passage specifies *how* - by speed *or* pressure.
* **C: Kgatello e fokolang** - The passage mentions *increasing* pressure.
* **D: Ho fokotseha ha monoana** - This doesn't relate to volume control on an accordion.



"
Hobaneng ha ditshwantsho tse thelebisheneng di kgaotswe mahlakoreng?,"The correct answer is **B: Hore setshwantsho se tlale sekrini kaofela**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ka lebaka lena, dintho tsohle tseo o di bonang thelevisheneng di ne di sehilwe meedi, hodimo, tlase le mahlakoreng. Sena se etsetswa ho netefatsa hore setshwantsho se tlala sekerine kaofela."" (Because of this, everything you see on television is cropped on the sides, top, bottom and edges. This is to ensure the image fills the screen completely.)
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mathata afe ho a latelang ao motho a ka kopanang le ona ha a fetolela filimi ho fomete ea DVD?","The correct answer is **A: Setshwantsho se sa tlatseng sekirini kaofela** (An image that doesn't fill the screen completely).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that ""overscan"" causes TVs to crop the edges of images. When transferring a movie to DVD, this overscan can happen again, meaning parts of the image – specifically subtitles at the bottom – might be cut off.  This results in the image *not* filling the screen completely.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dihloho tse sehiloloeng ka mokgoa o sa fellang** (Heads cut off in an unflattering way) - While overscan *can* cut off parts of the image, the passage doesn't mention heads specifically.
* **C: Setshwantsho se tlatsang sekirini kaofela** (An image that fills the screen completely) - This is the *opposite* of the problem described by overscan.
* **D: Kgaola meeli** (Broken lines) - The passage doesn't mention any issues with lines being broken.



"
Ho ne ho e-na le sesole sa Borithane se neng se le hokae?,"The correct answer is **A: Assunpink Creek**.

The passage states that James Ewing ""hape borokho bo leng Assunpink Creek mme a thibele masole le ha e le afe a dira hore a balehe."" This directly indicates a British force was at Assunpink Creek."
Ke mosaeno oa mang o hlahileng mongolong o ngotsweng ka letsoho?,"The correct answer is **D: Charles Thomson**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...lengolo le ngotsweng ka letsoho le saennweng ke Mopresidente wa Lekgotla John Hancock **le Mongodi Charles Thomson**...""  This directly identifies Charles Thomson as one of the people who signed the handwritten letter.



"
"Hara tulo tse latelang, ke efe ya ho qetela eo pampiri e kgolo ya Dunlap e fihletseng ho yona?","The correct answer is **C: London**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kopi ile ya fihla London ka August 10."" (A copy arrived in London on August 10th). This is the last location mentioned in the chronological order of the document's distribution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: New York** - While a copy was *read* to troops in New York, the document didn't *arrive* there last.
*   **B: Lebenkeleng la ho hatisa la Dunlap** - The broadsides originated *from* Dunlap's printing shop, but it wasn't the final destination.
*   **D: Independence Hall** - The document was read publicly there, but it wasn't the final destination.



"
Mabotho a Kolonele Stark a ne a le ho kae?,"The correct answer is **A: Qetellong e ya leboya, haufi le terata**.

The passage states: ""Banna ba Stark ba ile ba nka maemo haufi le terata e leng ka qetellong ya leboya moo e leng boemo ba Bo-radikoloni."" This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Lebopong la lewatle qetellong ya metsi:** The passage mentions a river (Noka ya Mystic) but doesn't place Stark's troops *on* the shore at the water's edge.
*   **C: Ho iphaphitha ka leboya-botjhabela ho hlwahlweng:** This describes where the enemy broke through, not where Stark's men were positioned.
*   **D: Ka pela terata:** While a breastwork was built *in front* of the line, the passage says Stark's men *took position near* the line itself, not solely in front of it.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, banna ba Stark ba ile ba eketsa terata ya bona neng?","The correct answer is **D: Ha mabotho a ntse a nka boemo ba pele**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Banna ba Stark ba ile ba nka maemo haufi le terata e leng ka qetellong ya leboya moo e leng boemo ba Bo-radikoloni."" and then immediately follows with ""Ha maqhubu a kokobetseng a bula sekgeo ho Noka ya Mystic ka leboya-botjhabela ba hlwahlwa, ba ekeditse terata ka lebota le lekgutswanyane la majwe..."" 

This clearly indicates they extended the line *while* taking their position as the advance troops.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ha Boradikolone ba ne ba bitsa batshehetsi ba matla** - The text mentions a request for reinforcements, but doesn't say the line was extended *during* that request.
*   **B: Ka mora hore batho ba tlwaelehileng ba tlole palo** - The text mentions not allowing anyone past the line until they were familiar with it, but not a dwindling of people.
*   **C: Nakong eo moea o fokolang** - The text does not mention wind.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e neng e le nako e tletseng tlhekefetso ka ho fetisisa ya Chaena?","The correct answer is **D: Nakong ya Borena bo Boraro** (During the Three Kingdoms period).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Mehleng eo ho bile le dintwa tse mahlo mafubedu pakeng tsa baetapele ba bangata ba lwanelang setulo sa borena...Mehleng ya Mebuso e Meraro e bile nako e tletseng tshollo ya madi e ngata nalaneng ya Chaena ya Mehleng ya Bohololoholo, moo batho ba diketekete ba ileng ba shwa ba lwanela ho kotsomala se maratswana ntlong ya borena e mahadihadi ya Xi’an."" 

This directly identifies the Three Kingdoms period as the most tumultuous and bloody time in Chinese history.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nakong ya-Jin Dynasty:** The passage mentions the Jin Dynasty but doesn't describe it as the most chaotic period.
*   **B: Nakong ya-Xi’an:** Xi’an is a city (and the location of the imperial court), not a dynasty or time period.
*   **C: Nakong ya-Han Dynasty:** While the Han Dynasty is mentioned, the passage highlights the chaos *between* the Han and Jin dynasties (the Three Kingdoms period)."
"Ho latela seratswana, nnete ke efe ka sehlopha sa bohloa ba sesole se kenang mokgahlelong oa bo hloma-u-hlomole?","The correct answer is **B: Ba ba le phepelo e nyane ya dijo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Bohlwa bo qala mokgahlelo wa hloma-o-hlomole ha dijo tse leng teng di fokotsehile."" This translates to ""The soldiers start the march when food supplies are low."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ba aha bodulo bosiu** - The passage says they *travel* at night, but doesn't mention building shelter at night.
* **C: Ba etsa madulo a fetolwang ka mora matsatsi a 17** - They make *fires* (dihlaha tsa nakwana) daily, not shelters, and the 17 days is the duration of the march, not when the fires change.
* **D: Ba tsamaya motshehare** - The passage states they travel at night and *stop* to camp during the day (""eme hore a kampe motshehare"").



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke polelo efe e buang ka nepo ka mekgwa ya sephiphitha sa dikokonyana ya ho etsa bodulo nakong ya hloma-u-hlomole?","The correct answer is **C: Ba tjhentjha bodulo letsatsi le letsatsi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that during the hloma-o-hlomole march, ""bohlwa bo etsa dihlaha tsa nakwana tse fetolwang letsatsi le letsatsi"" (the army makes small shelters that are changed daily). This directly translates to them *changing/refreshing their shelters daily*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ba aha bodulo bosiu** - The passage says they *travel* at night, but doesn't say they build shelters at night.
*   **B: Ba tsamaya matsatsi a 17 ntle le bodulo** - The passage says the journey *takes* 17 days, but it explicitly states they *build* shelters (even temporary ones).
*   **D: Ba sebedisa bodulo bo le bong ka nako eo** - This contradicts the statement that they change the shelters daily.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e tla tswella pele ho tsotellehe boteng ba matshwao a ka ntle?,"The correct answer is **B: Merethetho ya dinako tse itseng**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""Dinako tse bopeletsweng ke dintho tse potolohang tse kgonang ho ipoloka tse tla tswelang pele nakong ya potoloho e itsamaelang le ha ho se na matshwao a kantle.""  This means internal timing mechanisms (merethetho ya dinako tse itseng) continue to function even without external cues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Matshwao le diketsahalo tse ka hare** - While internal events play a role, the passage focuses on *mechanisms* that persist *despite* external signals.
*   **C: Nako ya tlhaho** - This is too broad. The passage is about *how* organisms keep time, not time itself.
*   **D: Merethetho e shebiloeng** - These are responses *to* external signals, which the passage says are not necessary for the internal rhythms to continue.



"
Ke lentswe lefe le hlalosang batho ba bontshang phapang ya ditlwaelo tse itseng tsa tlhaho?,"The correct answer is **D: Popo e fapaneng**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ha batho ka bomong ba bontsha mefuta e mmalwa e sa tshwaneng ya tshobotsi e itseng ba phela e le mefuta e fapa-fapaneng.""  This directly translates to ""When populations exhibit several different variations of a specific trait, they live as *different populations*.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Poponngwe (Population)** - While the passage discusses populations, it doesn't define that as the term for *variations* within a population.
* **B: Dintho tse phelang (Living things)** - This is too broad; the passage focuses on differences *within* living things, not living things in general.
* **C: Mefuta (Species)** -  The passage distinguishes between variations *within* a population; different species would have larger, more fundamental differences.



"
Ke lentswe lefe le nepahetseng ho a latelang bakeng sa dintho tse phelang tulong e itseng?,"The correct answer is **B: Baahi**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage defines ""Baahi"" (population) as a group of living things of a certain species that live in a particular area.** This aligns perfectly with the question asking for the correct term for living things in a specific place.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **Poponngwe (Individual):** Refers to a single organism, not a group.
*   **Mefuta (Species):** Refers to a general group of organisms with similar characteristics, not a group in a specific location.
*   **Popo e fapaneng (Different population):** Implies there are multiple populations being compared, not just the organisms in one place.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e ke keng ya eba mohlala wa ketsahalo ya bohahlauli e thehiloeng tlhahong?,"The correct answer is **D: Ho tshwasa ditlhapi ka difofane** (Fishing with airplanes).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on tourism that appreciates the natural environment.** Activities like hiking, photography, birdwatching, and learning about the local flora and fauna all fit this description.
* **Fishing with airplanes is a highly intrusive and unnatural activity.** It doesn't align with the core principle of appreciating and preserving the natural environment. It's more of a disruptive, resource-intensive practice.

Let's look at why the other options *are* examples of nature-based tourism:

* **A: Ho tsamaya ka maoto ho ya phororong** (Hiking to a waterfall) - Directly involves experiencing a natural landscape.
* **B: Ho nka dinepe tsa dipalesa tsa naheng** (Taking pictures of native animals) -  Focuses on observing and documenting wildlife, a key aspect of nature tourism.
* **C: Ho etela dirapa tsa boikgathollo le ho bala boitsebiso buang ka potoloho** (Visiting interpretive centers and reading information about the surroundings) - Enhances understanding and appreciation of the natural environment.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang eo e leng motheo wa motjha wa dipalangwang?","The correct answer is **A: Dibaka tsa mesebetsi (Workplaces)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...batho ba tsamaya ka dikoloi ho tloha ditoropong tsa dinaha tse nyenyane ho ya mesebetsing ya bona mme ba fetwa ke ba bang ba sebeletsang dibakeng tseo ba tlohileng ho tsona.""  This directly links the new transportation system to people commuting *to workplaces* and being overtaken by those who work where they used to live.  The system is built around supporting this movement *to* work.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dikoloi tsa botho (Personal cars):** While cars are used, they *facilitate* the system, they aren't the foundation *of* it. The system is about the destination (work) and the flow of people.
* **C: Bodulo bo tsitsitseng (Steady state):** The passage mentions a ""steady state"" of carbon, but this is a scientific point about the planet's history, *not* the basis of the new transportation system.
* **D: Tswelopele ya batho (Human development):** While implied, human development is too broad. The passage specifically focuses on commuting patterns related to work.



"
Dikarolo tse potapotileng dikhubu ya sele di na le mofuta ofe wa tjhatjhe?,"The correct answer is **A: Matla a motlakase a dielektrone**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dielektrone di na le bokgoni bo tlaase ba motlakase."" (Electrons have a low electrical charge).  The question asks about the *type* of charge around the nucleus, and electrons *have* electrical charge.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ha ho matla a motlakase:** The passage explicitly states electrons have charge.
*   **C: Matla a motlakase a dielektrone tse ngata:** While there are many electrons, the question is about the *type* of charge, not the quantity.
*   **D: Matla a motlakase a dielektrone tse fokolang le tse ngata:** This is unnecessarily specific and doesn't address the core question.



"
Khubu ya sele e bopilwe ka dikarolo dife?,"The correct answer is **D: Diprothone, dinyutrone, le dielektrone**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Khubu e na le dikarolwana tse pedi - di-neutron le diprothone."" and also mentions that electrons orbit the nucleus. Therefore, the nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons, and the atom as a whole includes electrons.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, mohlala wa palo ya baenari e nang le dikarolo tse hlano ke efe ho tse latelang?","The correct answer is **D: 110101**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states a binary number can only be 0 or 1.**
* **The question asks for an example of a binary number with *five digits*.**

Let's look at the options:

* **A: 1010** -  This is binary, but only has *four* digits.
* **B: 12001** - This is *not* binary because it contains the digits '2' and '0' is allowed.
* **C: 10010** - This is binary, but only has *five* digits.
* **D: 110101** - This is binary *and* has *six* digits.

Therefore, **D** is the only option that fits both criteria of being a binary number with five digits."
Dinomoro tsa binary di bitswa eng hape?,"The correct answer is **A: Dikotwana**.

The passage states: ""...dinomoro tse di bitswa binary digits - kapa **bits**..."" and the question asks for another name for binary numbers.  ""Dikotwana"" is the translation of ""bits"" in Setswana.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa bolelwang temaneng e le molemo wa mantlha wa ho ngodisa diithuti?,"The correct answer is **A: Ntlafatso ya thuto-puo le bokhoni ba ho ngola (Improvement of language skills and writing ability)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Ka ha diithuti ha ngata e le batho ba balang ba tshwayang diphoso haholo, mongodi wa blog o qala ho leka ka matla ho ngola hantle hore a seka a tshwaiwa diphoso.""  This directly connects blogging to a need to improve writing to avoid criticism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ho fokotseha ha ho nyatswa ho tswa ho dithaka (Reduced bullying from peers):**  The text doesn't mention bullying at all.
* **C: Tlhokomediso e atolositsweng ya tikoloho (Increased awareness of the environment):** While the text says blogging can make students ""tseba haholwanyane se se ba potolohileng"" (know more about what's around them), it doesn't present this as the *primary* benefit.
* **D: Takatso e eketsehileng ya ho tswela pele ho ithuta (Increased desire to continue learning):**  The text says blogging *encourages* learning outside of school, but doesn’t state a core benefit is increasing a desire to learn.



"
Ke dintlha dife ho tse latelang tsa ho ngolla di-blog tse qotsitsweng e le ntho e susumetsang baithuti ho ntlafatsa tsebo ya bona ya ho ngola?,"The correct answer is **B: Takatso ya ho qoba ho nyatsuwa** (Desire to avoid being corrected).

Here's why:

The passage states, ""...mongodi wa blog o qala ho leka ka matla ho ngola hantle hore a seka a tshwaiwa diphoso."" This directly translates to ""the blogger begins to try hard to write well so as not to be corrected.""  This demonstrates that the fear of being corrected motivates students to improve their writing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho arabela kgafetsa ho disebediswa tsa inthaneteng** (Responding frequently to internet resources): While the passage mentions responding to online resources, it doesn't say this *motivates* writing improvement. It's a result of the process, not the driving force.
*   **C: Ho boloka thahasello ya bamamedi ba bona** (Keeping their audience interested): This is mentioned as a benefit of blogging (encouraging students to be clever and interesting), but not as the primary motivating factor for improving writing skills.
*   **D: Tlhokahalo ya ditshebedisano** (Need for interaction): Interaction is mentioned as a positive aspect of blogging, but the passage doesn't state that this is what drives students to write better.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo e seng molemo wa puisano e sa tsitsang bakeng sa baithuti? ,"The correct answer is **C: Dihora tse bonolo tsa ho sebetsa**.

Here's why:

The passage states that asynchronous communication has ""dithibelo tsa nako tse mmalwa ka monyetla wa dihora tsa ho sebetsa tse feto-fetohang"" (several time constraints with varying working hours). This means flexible working hours are a *challenge* or limitation, not a benefit, of asynchronous communication.

Let's look at why the other options *are* benefits:

*   **A: Tšebediso ya marang-rang e le sesebediswa (Using the internet as a tool):** The passage explicitly states the internet and World Wide Web *enable* access to information.
*   **B: Ho fihlella difahleho ho barupedi ka nako efe kapa efe ya letsatsi (Access to instructors at any time of day):** The passage highlights the ability to ask questions and receive timely responses regardless of meeting schedules.
*   **D: Taolo ya lebelo (Pace control):** The passage mentions allowing students to work at their own pace and control the flow of information.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ya dikarolo tse latelang tsa puisano e sa fetoheng bakeng sa baithuti?","The correct answer is **A: Lebelo la ho ithuta (Learning Pace)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ho dumella diithuti di be le bokgoni ba ho sebetsa ka nako ya tsona le ho laola lebelo la boitsebiso ba ditaelo"" which translates to ""Allowing students to work at their own pace and control the rate of information of instructions.""  This directly refers to a student's learning pace.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dihora tsa ho sebetsa (Working hours)** - While the passage mentions ""dithibelo tsa nako tse mmalwa ka monyetla wa dihora tsa ho sebetsa tse feto-fetohang"" (multiple time constraints with variable working hours), this is presented as a *challenge*, not a non-negotiable component of communication.
*   **C: Boitsebiso bo rutang (Teaching information)** - The passage doesn’t talk about what *is* taught, just *how* students access it.
*   **D: Tshebediso ya inthanete (Internet usage)** - The internet is a *tool* that enables the flexibility, but it isn’t the core aspect of the unchanging communication element.



"
Ke eng e sa bolelwang seratswaneng see e le ntho eo motho a ka e amahanyang le diqhobosheane tsa mehleng e bohareng?,"The correct answer is **B: Ho lwana ka dipere (Fighting with dogs)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions ""medumo ya dipere tsa ntwa di terepela majweng"" (sounds of war dogs pacing in the courtyards). This directly links war dogs to the imagery evoked by castles and historical battles.

Let's look at why the other options are less directly related:

*   **A: Dikoti tsa dikoting (Castle walls)** - While the passage mentions castles, it doesn't specifically link them as something you would *associate* with the *reason* castles were built, or what they were for.
*   **C: Boikemisetso (Determination)** - This is a thematic element potentially present, but not explicitly mentioned in connection with castles.
*   **D: Bahlabani (Warriors/Heroes)** - The passage mentions knights and heroes, but again, it doesn't directly link them to the origin/purpose of castles.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa bolelwang temaneng e le monko kapa modumo o ka hlahiswang hara dithako tsa qhoboshyane?,"The correct answer is **D: Ditlhako**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions hearing the sounds of battles, war dogs, and people crying out in fear *within* the walls of the castle. It also mentions imagining things, and the imagery evokes a sense of history and the past. 

* **A: Dintwa (Battles)** - The passage states you can *hear* battles.
* **B: Tshabo (Fear)** - The passage states you can *hear* people crying out in fear.
* **C: Mekete (Celebrations)** - The passage mentions celebrations as part of the imagery evoked by the castle, but doesn't say you can hear them within the walls.
* **D: Ditlhako (Cracks)** - The passage explicitly mentions ""dithako tse seng di qetile dilemo tse sekete"" (walls that are a thousand years old).  While not a sound, the *presence* of the walls themselves (and implicitly, their deterioration) is a physical element mentioned. This is the only option that directly relates to the physical structure described.

Therefore, **Ditlhako** is the only element directly referenced as being *within* the castle walls.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e leng tlhaloso e nepahetseng ya Qhoboshyane ya Kirby Muxloe?,"The correct answer is **B: E ne e hloka tshireletso e fokolang ka lebaka la tlhaho ya kgotso ya naha nakong ya kaho**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Ka bo1480, ha Lord Hastings a qala ho e haha, ho ne ho batla ho na le kgotso mme ho hlokahala tshireletso feela kgahlanong le dihlotshwana tse nyane tsa bafutuhi..."" This directly supports the idea that the castle didn't require strong defenses because of the peaceful conditions at the time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't say the walls were *weakened* by Lord Hastings, but rather that they weren't built to withstand strong attacks.
*   **C:** The passage states it was *not* a true castle, implying it was fairly typical for its time (a manor house protected as a castle), rather than unusual.
*   **D:** The passage specifically says it *couldn't* withstand long or determined sieges."
Ke efe ho dikarolo tse latelang tsa kaho e ka nkwang e le ntho e sa tlwaelehang bakeng sa Qhobosheyane ya Kirby Muxloe ka nako e hlalositsweng temaneng ee?,"The correct answer is **C: Tshireletso e fokolang ho feta ya diqhoboshyane tse ding**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Kirby Muxloe was built when there was relative peace and only needed defense against *minor raids*. This means its defenses were *less* than typical castles of the time. The passage specifically contrasts it with a ""true castle,"" implying it wasn't built for strong attacks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Difensetere tse kgolo** - The passage does not mention anything about the size of the windows.
*   **B: Motheo o hahilweng ho emelana le ditlhaselo** - The passage says the building *wouldn't* withstand a strong attack.
*   **D: Mabota a masesaane** - While it has stone walls, this was standard building practice, not unusual for the time period. It's also mentioned the walls wouldn't hold up to strong attacks.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that while speed is important for a half-marathon, **endurance is *crucially* more important.** It states, ""mamello e lokela ho hlaolelwa dikotsing kaofela"" (endurance must be prioritized above all else). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho itlwaetsa ho matha hara naha nakong ya lehlabula:** While running in open fields is mentioned as good preparation, the passage doesn't specifically say this is the *best* thing to do.
*   **C: Ho otla nako ya metsotso e meraro:** This is too specific and doesn't relate to the central theme of endurance.
*   **D: Ho sebedisa dijimi ho kwetlisa karolo e ka hodimo ya mmele:** The passage mentions upper body strength training as *part* of preparation, but doesn't suggest it's the most important aspect.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang eo e leng ya bohlokwa ka ho fetisisa ho semathi-se-ipabolang-sa-halofo-ya maele?","The correct answer is **B: Ho hlaolela mamello ho feta lebelo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ke nnete hore motho ya mathang halofo ya mile a le sehlopheng se pele, o tshwanetse ho ba le boholo ba lebelo bo lekaneng, empa **mamello e lokela ho hlaolelwa dikotsing kaofela.**""  This directly emphasizes that endurance is more crucial than speed for success in a half-mile race.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho itlwaetsa ho matha ka hara naha nakong ya dikgwedi tsa mariha** - While the passage mentions training on open ground in the heat, it doesn't say this is *most* important.
*   **C: Ho kena ka tlase ho metsotso e mmedi** - The passage does not mention a specific time goal.
*   **D: Ho hlaolela lebelo ho feta mamello** - The passage directly contradicts this, saying endurance is prioritized.

"Bakeng sa moatlelete, ke efe ho tse latelang e ke keng ya finyellwa feela ka mekgwa ya phepo e nepahetseng?","The correct answer is **C: Tshebetso e phahameng**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that *perfect nutrition alone cannot cause peak performance*. It says it can *affect overall athlete health* and *help improve performance and enjoyment*, but doesn't guarantee reaching the very highest levels of competition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ntlafatsa tshebetso (Improve performance):** The passage says nutrition can *help* improve performance.
*   **B: Eketsa thabo (Increase enjoyment):** The passage specifically mentions increasing enjoyment of the sport.
*   **D: Bophelo bo botle ka kakaretso (Overall health):** The passage states nutrition can positively affect overall athlete health.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions these as ways to improve enjoyment and performance:

*   **Ho itlwaetsa phepo e nepahetseng (Proper nutrition)** - Mentioned as important for overall health and performance.
*   **Ho kenya metsi hantle (Adequate hydration)** - Specifically stated as a beneficial practice.
*   **Ho boloka botsitso ba matla a bophelo bo botle (Maintaining healthy energy balance)** - Also mentioned as crucial.

The passage *does not* mention consistent work ethic (""Ho sebetsa ka mokgwa o tsitsitseng"") as a key factor in increasing enjoyment of sports. While consistency is generally good, it isn't highlighted in this specific text.

"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke hobaneng semathi sa sebaka se mahareng se ka reka sesebediswa se turang hofeta?","The correct answer is **D: Ho na le maikutlo a fosahetseng mabapi le disebediswa tse theko e tlaase** (There are misconceptions about lower-priced equipment).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...there are many misconceptions about the few pieces of equipment needed to participate."" and that athletes might *feel* they like a product even if it doesn't offer real benefits. This points to people believing more expensive equipment is better, even if it isn't demonstrably so.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ke kgetho ya bona ya botho (It's their personal preference):** While preference plays a role, the passage emphasizes misinformation as a driving factor, not just personal taste.
* **B: E na le melemo e netefaditsweng (It has proven benefits):** The passage actually suggests the opposite - many products have little to no real benefit.
* **C: E tla ama tshebetso ya bona haholo (It will greatly affect their performance):** The passage implies the impact is often minimal or non-existent.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho matha sebaka se bohareng ho hloka eng?","The correct answer is **A: Disebediswa tse ngata**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ho matha ho leng bohareng ke papadi eo ha e bapiswa e sa bitseng tjhelete e ngata; le ha ho le jwalo, ho na le mehopolo e mengata e fosahetseng mabapi le dikarolowana tse mmalwa tsa thepa e hlokahalang ho nka karolo.""

This translates to: ""Running in the middle ground is affordable compared to not spending much money; however, there are many misconceptions about the few pieces of equipment needed to participate."" 

This clearly indicates that while not *expensive*, running still requires ""dikarolwana tse mmalwa tsa thepa"" - *many pieces of equipment*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Semelo sa diatleletiki se thehilweng** (An established athletic foundation) - The passage doesn't mention anything about needing a strong athletic background.
*   **C: Disebediswa tse nyane haholo** (Very little equipment) - The passage explicitly says there's misconception about *how many* equipment is needed, implying it's more than people think.
*   **D: tjhelete e ngata** (A lot of money) - The passage states it's *affordable* compared to other activities.



"
Ke mang ya sibolotseng matla a khohedi a nyutlelie? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch le Purcell**.

The text states: ""MRI e thehilwe ketsahalong ya saense e bitswang nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), e ileng ya fumanwa ka bo1930 ke Felix Bloch hammoho le Edward Purcell..."" (MRI is based on a scientific phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch together with Edward Purcell...).

Therefore, both Bloch and Purcell are credited with discovering NMR, the principle behind MRI.



"
Tumello ya molao e ile ya fanwa ka selemo sefe bakeng sa tshebediso ya sekene sa bongaka? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The text states: ""Dilemo tse nne hamorao ho ile ha fanwa ka tumello, eo e neng e le tumello ya ho qala lefatsheng e ntshitsweng lefapheng la MRI.""  Raymond Damadian made the discovery in 1970, and four years later, in 1974, the approval was granted.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 1977** - This is the year Dr. Damadian completed building the first full-body MRI scanner.
* **C: 1930** - This is the year NMR was discovered, not when MRI was approved for medical use.
* **D: 1970** - This is the year Damadian made the foundational discovery, not the year of approval.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, batho ba lokela ho ba le kutlwisiso e matla ya eng e le hore ba ka hlalosa diketso tsa batho ba bang?","The correct answer is **B: Boikemisetso (Intention)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Har’a bokgoni bona, ho utlwisisa boikemisetso ba batho ba bang ho bohlokwa haholo."" (Among these abilities, understanding the intentions of others is most important.) The example given demonstrates how understanding *why* someone is doing something (their intention - to steal or to get into their own locked car) drastically changes how you interpret their actions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Takatso (Desire):** While desire plays a role, the passage focuses on understanding the *reason* behind the action, not just what someone wants.
*   **C: Tumelo (Belief):** Beliefs influence actions, but understanding the immediate intention is more critical for interpretation.
*   **D: Maikutlo (Feelings):** Feelings can contribute to actions, but the passage stresses understanding the planned purpose behind the act.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho utlwisisa morero ho thusa batho ho etsa eng?","The correct answer is **D: Ho bala dikelello tsa ba bang**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that people are endowed with the ability to read the intentions of others, and that understanding their determination is crucial. The example about the person trying to open the car window directly illustrates using intention to correctly interpret an action - is it theft, or just a locked-out owner?

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho fedisa ho se kgodisehe ka diketso tsa ba bang:** While understanding intentions *can* reduce confusion, the passage doesn't focus on eliminating frustration.
*   **B: Ho bolela ditakatso:** The passage is about *understanding* what others intend, not expressing your own.
*   **C: Ho sheba batho ba bang ntle le kahlolo:** The passage isn’t about judging or not judging people, but about correctly interpreting their actions.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang eo e leng kakaretso e nepahetseng ya sepheo se seholo sa AI?","The correct answer is **D: Mosebetsi o iketsang (Automated tasks)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that AI research ""involves making machines able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence."" This directly equates to automating tasks that would usually need a person to do them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Thero (Theory):** While AI is *based* on theory, the passage focuses on its practical application, not the theory itself.
*   **B: Temoho ya lentswe (Speech recognition):** Speech recognition is an *example* of what AI can do, but not the overall goal.
*   **C: Kemiso (Planning):** Planning is another *example* of an AI capability, but again, not the overarching purpose.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang eo AI e atisang ho amahanngwa le yona?","The correct answer is **B: Thero le kemiso**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that AI research includes making machines perform tasks that *require human intelligence*, and gives ""planning and decision-making"" as an example. 

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Tshebeletso ya bareki (Customer service):** While the passage mentions AI's ability to answer customer questions, it's only *one* example, not a primary association.
*   **C: Dingolwa tsa boiqapelo tsa mahlale (Science fiction):** The passage mentions AI's role in science *as a field*, but doesn't say it's often associated with science fiction.
*   **D: Temoho ya mongolo (Handwriting recognition):** Similar to customer service, this is just one specific capability mentioned, not a central association.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang eo e leng matla a motho ya nang le mekgwa ya ho nahana e feto-fetohang?","The correct answer is **A: Ho fumana dikarabo tse ngata tse nepahetseng bothateng** (Finding many correct answers to a problem).

Here's why:

The passage describes a thought process focused on *one* correct answer, accuracy, and logic. This is the *opposite* of flexible thinking. Flexible thinkers excel at finding *multiple* solutions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ho sebedisa mekgwa e mecha bothateng** (Using new methods to solve a problem): While not inherently wrong, the passage emphasizes applying *existing* techniques, not creating new ones.
* **C: Ho ipha nako ya bona ho rarolla mathata** (Taking their time to solve problems): The passage highlights *speed* and efficiency.
* **D: Mekgwa ya ho tshwara ka hlooho** (Head-scratching techniques):  This is too vague and doesn't relate to the described thought process.

The text directly implies a belief in a single, correct solution, making the ability to find *multiple* correct solutions the defining characteristic of a different style of thinking.



"
"Ho latela seratswana sena, ke efe ho e latelang e sa nkweng e le sepheo sa mohopolo o feto-fetohang wa ho nahana?","The correct answer is **B: Ho ipha nako**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes speed, efficiency, and precision as key aspects of this thought process. It focuses on quick, logical thinking and utilizing existing knowledge. Taking time (giving yourself time) is *not* mentioned and would actually contradict the core principles described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

*   **A: Ho utlwisisa hore ho na le karabo e le nngwe feela e nepahetseng** - The passage explicitly states this is a central point of this type of thinking.
*   **C: Ho kgetholla dintlha** - The passage mentions the ability to reinforce concepts and solve problems, implying a focus on identifying key details.
*   **D: Ho bokella tlhahisoleseding** - The passage mentions gathering information as part of the process.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e ke keng ya nkwa e le polelwana-e-nyane?","The correct answer is **D: Ho fana ka mahlohonolo (Giving compliments)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on *subtle cues* and *microexpressions* – tiny, almost imperceptible facial movements that reveal true feelings.  These are things people do *unconsciously*.

Let's look at each option:

*   **A: Ho sheba ka thoko ha o ntse o bua (Looking intently while speaking)** - This could indicate deception or genuine interest and is a subtle cue.
*   **B: Ho phunya phatla (Fidgeting)** - This is a nervous gesture that could indicate discomfort or lying.
*   **C: Ho panya ka potlako (Blinking rapidly)** - This can be a sign of stress or deception.
*   **D: Ho fana ka mahlohonolo (Giving compliments)** - This is a *deliberate* action, not a subconscious microexpression. People consciously choose to give compliments. It's not a subtle cue revealing hidden emotions.

Therefore, giving compliments doesn't fit the description of the subtle cues the passage discusses."
Ke efe ya dipolelo tse latelang mabapi le tlhaloso ya polelwana-e-nyane eo e seng nnete?,"The correct answer is **A: Direkoto tsa divideyo di lebisitse tswelo-peleng e kgolo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that microexpressions can reveal important information and even detect deception. However, it *doesn't* say that video directors are driving increased interest in microexpressions. It's the *study* of microexpressions (highlighted by people like Oliver Sacks) that is revealing their importance.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

* **B: Tlhaloso e nepahetseng e ka lemoha leshano:** The passage explicitly states ""one can spot a lie by accurately reading facial microexpressions.""
* **C: Puo hammoho le ponahalo ya sefahleho dia hlaloswa:**  The passage discusses how even people unable to *understand* speech can understand truthfulness through facial expressions – indicating both speech and facial appearance are being ""read"" or interpreted.
* **D: E ka thusa ho hlahloba botshepehi:** The entire passage centers on the idea that microexpressions can be used to detect deception (i.e., assess trustworthiness).



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e ileng ya ba ya bohlokwa haholwanyane ka lebaka la Tsosoloso? ,"The correct answer is **C: Ho hopola mongolo (Memorizing text)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that *before* the Renaissance, gaining knowledge was about memorization. The passage specifically says the focus shifted *from* memorizing information itself *to* memorizing *texts*.  The Renaissance, by making texts more widely available, made the ability to memorize those texts crucial.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho hopola motho ka mong (Individual memorization):** While memorization was important, the passage doesn’t highlight individual memorization *becoming* more important. It focuses on the change to memorizing texts.
*   **B: Tsebo e potolohang (Circulating knowledge):**  While the Renaissance *led* to more circulating knowledge, it wasn't the immediate, core change the passage highlights.
*   **D: Ho fumana dintlha (Finding details):** The passage doesn’t mention anything about finding details. It's about how knowledge was *stored* and *accessed*.



"
"Ka lebaka la Tsosoloso, ho ile ha ba le ho hatiswa ho fokolang hofe ho tse latelang?","The correct answer is **A: Ho hopola motho ka mong** (Individual memorization).

Here's why:

The passage states that before the changes brought by the Renaissance, the focus was on *memorization* itself. People didn't need to remember information, but rather the *ability to memorize* was key. The Renaissance changed this, lessening the pressure to memorize because knowledge could be accessed and spread more easily through printing.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ho fumana tsebo** (Acquiring knowledge): The Renaissance *increased* access to knowledge.
*   **C: Ho hopola mongolo** (Memorizing text): While related, the core shift wasn't about memorizing the text itself, but the *ability* to memorize in general.
*   **D: Kabo ya ditaba** (Distribution of information): The Renaissance *improved* the distribution of information through printing.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa bontsheng tshusumetso ya ho sebedisa inthanete bakeng sa dikamano tse tswelang pele?,"The correct answer is **A: Kgokahano ya kgwebo (Business connections)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the *social and emotional* motivations for using the internet – learning, making friends, self-expression, and strengthening relationships. It highlights how the internet impacts personal connections.

Let's look at why the other options *do* relate to the passage's theme:

*   **B: Ho dula o buisana le ba lelapa (Staying in touch with family)** - Directly relates to ""strengthening relationships"" mentioned by Eighmey and McCord.
*   **C: Ho etsa dipatlisiso maetong (Making friends)** - Aligns with James et al.'s finding that ""making friends"" is a key motivation for internet use.
*   **D: Ho kopana le batho ba batjha (Meeting new people)** - This is also about forming relationships, fitting into the themes of social interaction in the passage.

**Kgokahano ya kgwebo (Business connections)**, while a valid use of the internet, doesn't inherently focus on the *personal* or *emotional* connection aspect discussed in the passage. The passage is about how the internet affects how people relate to *each other* as individuals, not how it facilitates professional dealings.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa bontsheng tshusumetso ya ho sebedisa inthanethe bakeng sa ho ameha?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho batla resepe** (Searching for a recipe).

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the *social* aspects of internet use – learning, making friends, self-expression, and strengthening relationships.  All the other options directly relate to those aspects:

* **B: Ho beha letlapa ladipuisano inthaneteng** (Posting on an online forum) – This is clearly a social interaction.
* **C: Ho etsa dipatlisiso ka dihlahiswa tsa tlhokomelo ya bophelo** (Researching health products) – While it *could* be individual, it often leads to seeking advice from others online or joining communities.
* **D: Ho laola ditjhelete** (Managing finances) - Increasingly, this involves online banking communities, forums for financial advice, or sharing financial information with others.

**Ho batla resepe** (Searching for a recipe) is primarily an informational activity. While you might share a recipe *afterward*, the act of searching for it itself doesn't necessarily involve social interaction or emotional exchange as described in the passage. It's a task-oriented use of the internet, not a relational one.

Europe Bophirimela e ile ya kgaotsa neng ho itshetleha haholo ka ditshusumetso le ho qala ho iketsetsa mokgwa wa yona?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho elella bofelong ba Mehla e Bohareng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""E nngwe ya dintlafatso tse kgolo ka nako eo ka lebaka la batho ba masole a tumelo e bile ho sebedisa dikonopo ho qhwaela diaparo. **Ho elella qetellong ya Mehla e Bohareng, Yuropa bophirimela e ile ya qala setaele sa yona.**""  This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nakong ya mehla ya Byzantine:** The passage states Western Europe was *initially* influenced by Byzantine styles, but it wasn't when they started developing their own.
*   **C: Hoo e ka bang dilemo tse 25 ka mora Mehla e Bohareng:** The passage says Western styles *lagged* behind Eastern styles by 25-30 years, not that they started their own style 25 years *after* the Middle Ages.
*   **D: Ngwahakgolong wa bo11:** The passage mentions the 10th-11th and 14th centuries, but doesn't state that the 11th century was when the shift to a unique Western style began.



"
Ho sebedisa dikonopo ho tiisa diaparo ho bile phello ya eng? ,"The correct answer is **C: Dintwa Tsa Bodumedi**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""E nngwe ya dintlafatso tse kgolo ka nako eo ka lebaka la batho ba masole a tumelo e bile ho sebedisa dikonopo ho qhwaela diaparo."" This directly links the use of buttons to the *people of the religious armies* - meaning those involved in the Crusades (Dintwa Tsa Bodumedi).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nako ya Gothic:** While Gothic style developed during this period, the passage doesn't connect buttons specifically to the Gothic era.
*   **B: Mehle ya Byzantine:** The passage states clothing was *initially* inspired by Byzantine styles, but the buttons weren't a result of that influence.
*   **D: Mehla e Bohareng:** This is too broad. The use of buttons was a specific development *within* the Medieval period, related to the Crusades.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e nkwang e le tharollo ya nako e telele ditabeng tsa tikoloho?","The correct answer is **C: Ho hlwaya sesosa sa mathata (Finding the root cause of the problems)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...haeba re sa batle tharollo ya nakwana, jwale re tshwanetse ho fumana motso wa mathata, mme re a fedise."" This directly translates to ""if we don't want a short-term solution, now we must find the root of the problem and finish it.""  The text emphasizes that simply treating symptoms (like being ""friends with the environment"") isn't enough – we need to address the underlying causes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho tlohela mekgwa e mebe ya bophelo (Abandoning bad lifestyles):** While this is *part* of the solution, the passage doesn't present it as the complete, long-term answer. It's a consequence of finding the root cause.
*   **B: Boiketsiso (Innovation):** The passage acknowledges scientific and technological advancements, but also points out they’ve *contributed* to the problems, not necessarily solved them.
*   **D: Ho ba motswalle wa motsamayo wa tikoloho (Being friends with the environment):** The passage mentions this as a temporary measure (""kalafo ya matshwao"" - a symbolic solution) but dismisses it as insufficient on its own.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke efe ya ditharollo tse latelang e ke keng ya nkwa e le phekolo ya matshwao a ditaba tsa tikoloho?","The correct answer is **B: Ho tima disosa tsa ditaba** (Ignoring the sources of problems).

Here's why:

The passage argues that simply addressing the *symptoms* of environmental problems (like a ""bandage solution"") isn't enough. We need to find the *root causes*.  Ignoring the sources of the problems is the opposite of finding the root causes and therefore wouldn't be a long-term solution.

Let's look at why the other options *could* be considered aspects of a more thorough approach:

*   **A: Ho ikakgela ka setotswana** (Self-reflection) - Understanding our own impact and behaviours is a good first step towards finding solutions.
*   **C: Ho fana ka maikutlo mabapi le kgetho ya bophelo bo feteletseng** (Giving thought to excessive lifestyles) - The passage specifically mentions wasteful lifestyles as part of the problem, so considering alternatives is helpful.
*   **D: Ho phela ka tsela e baballang tikoloho** (Living in an environmentally responsible way) - This directly addresses the impact of our choices and is aligned with finding sustainable solutions.

Ntwa ya pele ya Europe e bile naheng efe eo ho neng ho bolelwa hore taba ya yona e bohareng e amana le ho leka-lekana ha matla ho e-na le ho ba le taba ya bodumedi?,"The correct answer is **D: Spain**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ntwa ya Tlhahlamano ya Borena ba Spain e bile ntwa ya pele eo sesosa se ka sehloohong sa yona e neng e le tekatekano ya matla."" (The War of the Spanish Succession was the first war whose main cause was the balance of power.)
"
Ke ntwa efe eo ka dinako tse ding e hlaloswang e le ‘ntwa ya bodumedi’ ya ho qetela?,"The correct answer is **A: Ntwa ya Dilemo Tse Mashome a Mararo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kahoo Ntwa ya Dilemo tse Mashome a Mararo e ne e tla ba ntwa ya ho qetela e rehwang ntwa ya bodumedi."" (Therefore, the Thirty Years’ War would be the last war fought as a religious war.)



"
Ke dintlha dife ho tse latelang tsa Kereke e Khatholike tse neng di sa hlahlojwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Bongata ba matla ka hare ho Kereke**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Church had a lot of power and wealth, and this led people to question whether its beliefs were being followed correctly.  This directly implies a scrutiny of the *amount* of power the Church held.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Haeba kabo ya leruo ka hare ho Kereke e ne e loketse (Whether the distribution of wealth within the Church was appropriate):** While related to the issue of wealth, the passage focuses more on whether the wealth was *used* as the religion dictated, not just *how* it was distributed.
* **B: Haeba ditaba tse kholo tsa bodumedi di lokela ho lokiswa (Whether major religious issues should be fixed):** The passage doesn’t specifically mention issues needing “fixing” within the core beliefs, but rather the *application* of those beliefs.
* **D: Haeba ho ne ho finyellwa dithuto tse kgolo tsa Kereke (Whether the major teachings of the Church were fulfilled):** The passage states people questioned whether the teachings *were* being followed (specifically regarding helping the poor), implying a lack of fulfillment, but doesn’t ask about the teachings themselves being problematic.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang ya bolailweng Versailles?","The correct answer is **D: Molebedi**.

The text states: ""...setsho sa sehlopha seo se halefileng se ile sa tsoka hlooho ya **molebedi wa boreneng ya bolailweng Versailles** kapela Mofumahadi ya tshohileng.""  This directly identifies the molebedi (servant) as the one who was killed at Versailles."
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa kang ya qobellwa ho Morena le Mofumahadi ke mokhopi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho bulwa ha difensetere tsa dikoloi tsa bona**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the mob *forced* the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriage. Options B, C and D are all things that happened to the Royal Family as described in the passage.

* **B: Ho tswa ka tshohanyetso ho tloha Versailles** – They were *compelled* to leave Versailles.
* **C: Pono ya ho kgaolwa ha molebedi** – The Queen was shown the head of the murdered servant.
* **D: Leeto la ho kgutlela Paris** – They were forced to return to Paris.

Therefore, option A is the only action that was not *forced* upon the King and Queen but was a direct result of the mob’s demand."
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa kang ya bakwa ke ntwa e sa tlwaelehang ya sesole sa metsing ya Brithani?,"The correct answer is **A: Takatso ya Jeremane ya ho sebedisa maqheka a tshwanang a ntwa.**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Jeremane e ne e lebeletse karabelo e tshwanang ha e lalasa ntweng ya yona ya disabomarine"" - meaning Germany *expected* to retaliate similarly, not that Britain's actions *caused* Germany to decide to use unrestricted submarine warfare. They were already considering it as a response.

Let's look at why the other options *were* caused by Britain's actions:

*   **B: Dikepe tse sa amehang di ile tsa behwa kotsing** - The passage explicitly says Britain's blockade ""e ile ya kotsi le bakeng sa dikepe tse sa ameheng ntweng.""
*   **C: Ho ile ha etswa diphetoho molaong wa amatjhaba** - The passage mentions Britain's blockade ""e ile ya tlola molao o neng o amohelwa ka kakaretso o neng o ngotswe ditumellanong tse ngata tsa matjhaba..."" indicating a change to international law.
*   **D: Disebediswa tsa bohlokwa idi ne di sa fihlellehe** - The passage says the blockade ""e ile la sitisa phepelo ya bohlokwa ya sesole le baahi,"" meaning vital supplies were prevented from reaching their destinations.



"
Ke polelo efe e sa hlaloseng ka nepo thibelo ya sesole sa Brithani kgahlanong le Jeremane?,"The correct answer is **D: E ile ya etsa bonnete ba hore dikepe tse sa nkeng lehlakore di ke tsa senyeha**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the British blockade was *dangerous and risky for neutral ships*. It didn't *ensure* their safety; it jeopardized it.  The blockade indiscriminately blocked ships, regardless of their affiliation.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: E ne e le kgahlanong le molao wa matjhaba:** The passage explicitly states the blockade ""violated the commonly accepted law written into numerous international agreements.""
*   **B: E ile ya qholotsa ntwa ya sesole sa metsing sa Jeremane:** The passage says it disrupted vital military supplies, effectively hindering the German war effort at sea.
*   **C: E ile ya sitisa phallo ya phepelo ya Jeremane:** The passage states it disrupted ""vital military and civilian supplies.""

"Ho ipapisitswe le seratswana sena, ho ka etsahala hore ebe hangata ho fumanwa hore ke motho ofe ya nang le Multiple Sclerosis?","The correct answer is **A: Mosadi ya dilemo di 32** (A woman aged 32).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** MS is more common in young to middle-aged adults, and women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
* **Option A fits both criteria:** A 32-year-old woman falls into the young to middle-aged range, and is female, making her the most likely candidate based on the information provided.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Moshanyana ya dilemo di 15** (A 15-year-old boy) - MS is less common in teenagers.
* **C: Monna ya dilemo di 43** (A 43-year-old man) - While in the correct age range, men are *less* likely to get MS than women.
* **D: Ngwanana ya dilemo di 10** (A 10-year-old girl) - MS is very rare in children.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, barupeduwa mesebetsing ya kamehla ba ne ba hloka tshehetso e eketsehileng bakeng sa eng?","The correct answer is **A: Maikutlo a fosahetseng ka bohloko**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Batho ba nkang karolo boikwetlisong ba kamehla ba hloka tshehetso e kgolo mabapi le mohopolo o fosahetseng wa bohloko..."" This directly translates to ""People participating in training always needed a lot of support regarding a mistaken idea of pain..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mokokotlo o tlase** - The passage mentions the lower spinal cord, but the need for support is *about* their understanding of pain, not the spinal cord itself.
*   **C: Kgatello ya maikutlo** - While the passage mentions emotional distress, the specific need for support is tied to their *misconceptions about pain*.
*   **D: Tshabo** - Fear is mentioned, but again, the support needed is due to the *misunderstanding of pain*.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, hangata papadi ya fensing e bapalwa jwang?","The correct answer is **A: Ka mokgwa wa kajeno**.

The text states: ""Papadi ya kajeno ya ho lwana ka disabole e bapalwa ditekanyetsong tse ngata..."" which translates to ""Modern fencing is played in many competitions..."".  Therefore, the passage specifically says the fencing described is the *modern* form.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Boemong ba univesithi:** While it's *played* at universities, it's not *always* played there. The text mentions it as just one example.
* **C: Boemong ba Diolimpiki:** Similar to universities, the Olympics is one location, but not the general way it's played.
* **D: Ka dibopeho tse pedi:** The text describes a one-on-one duel, not teams (""pakaeng tsa batho ba babedi"").

"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e ka bang pontsho e matla ka ho fetisisa ya chefu ya ka hare?","The correct answer is **D: Botlolo ya pidisi ya ngaka** (A bottle of doctor's medicine).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sesupo se molemo sa ho ba le chefu ka hare ke ho ba teng ha ntho e tshelang meriana e butsweng kapa dik’hemik’hale tsa ntlo tse nang le chefu.""  (A good indication of having poisoning inside is the presence of opened living medicine or household chemicals with poison).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho nyekelwa ke pelo le feberu** (Heart palpitations and fever) - These are general symptoms that can be caused by many things, not specifically poisoning.
*   **B: Ho hlatsa le ho fufulelwa** (Vomiting and dizziness) - These are common symptoms but not a *strong* indicator as they can result from many illnesses. The passage mentions these as being something that wouldn't necessarily lead to immediate testing.
*   **C: Ho ba le ho hlaba ho matla le bohloko ka mpeng** (Having strong itching and abdominal pain) - Again, these are symptoms that can have various causes.

The presence of medicine bottles (specifically *opened* ones) directly links to the potential for poisoning, as stated in the passage."
"Ho ya ka seratswana, mohato wa pele o nepahetseng ke ofe ha ho hlahlojwa motho ya hlokofaditsweng?","The correct answer is **C: Sheba boemo ba mohlaseduwa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""o lokela pele o hlahlobe sebaka mme o netefatse polokeho ya hao. O lokela ho **hlokomela boemo ba mohlaseduwa** ha o ntse o mo atamela...""  This means the first step is to assess the condition of the injured person.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hlokomela ketsahalo eo** - While understanding what happened is important, the passage prioritizes assessing the *person's condition* first.
*   **B: Atamela mohlaseduwa** - The passage says to assess *while* approaching, not to approach as the very first step.
*   **D: Emela thuso** - While calling for help is a good idea, the passage instructs you to assess the situation *before* necessarily waiting for help. You need to know what help is needed.



"
Ke efe ho dipolelo tse latelang e sa bontsheng ka nepo mokgwa wa ho hlahloba mohlasediwa?,"The correct answer is **A: O se ke wa ameha ka ho ba le maqeba**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes assessing the *scene* for safety *before* approaching and observing the casualty's condition.  It also warns against making things worse by trying to help if you're not sure what you're doing.  Checking for wounds is *part* of assessing the casualty's condition (covered by option C), but simply saying ""don't touch wounds"" is incomplete and doesn't represent a proper scene assessment or casualty observation.  It's an action you might take *after* assessing, not the assessment itself.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: Lekola sebaka ka pela mohlaseduwa** - The passage says to ""hlahloba sebaka"" (check the scene) *before* approaching.
* **C: Sheba boemo ba mohlaseduwa** - The passage specifically states, ""O lokela ho hlokomela boemo ba mohlaseduwa"" (You must observe the condition of the casualty).
* **D: Leka ho ela hloko difolakha tse kgubedu** - This is aligned with identifying ""matshwao a lemosang kotsi a hlahellang"" (danger signs).



"
Ke diphetoho dife tse bakilweng ke Phetohelo ya Mafora tse bileng le tshusumetso e kholo ho baahi ba sehlopha sa basebetsi?,"The most accurate answer is **B: Phetoho ya maikutlo ho tloha sehlopheng ho ya ho bokgoni** (Shift in thinking from class to merit).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ho Lwanela Phetoho Fora...mesebetsi e ile ya bulelwa banna bohle ba kenyang dikopo, e leng se tlisitseng katleho ho ba nang le ditabatabelo tse hodimo le ba atlehileng...ba ne ba se ba fuwa maemo ho itshetlehile ka bokgoni ba motho."" This directly describes a shift *away* from positions based on social class (inheritance, etc.) and *towards* positions based on individual ability and achievement.

Let's look at why the other options are less directly linked to the impact on the working class:

* **A: Tshehetso e eketsehileng bakeng sa setjhaba** (Increased support for nationalism) - While the passage mentions nationalism, it doesn't specifically focus on how this benefited the working class.
* **C: Ho amohelwa ha maikutlo a Rephabliki** (Acceptance of republican ideas) - Similar to nationalism, it's a broader societal change, but not directly tied to improved conditions for workers.
* **D: Sistimi e ntjha ya ho metha** (New measurement system) - The metric system is mentioned, but is a very minor detail in the context of the changes affecting the working class.



"
"Ka mora Phetohelo ya Mafora, katleho sesoleng le mesebetsing e meng e ne e sa ka ya thehwa hodima eng?","The correct answer is **C: Takatso**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ho fapana le hore maemo sesoleng a itshetlehe ka maemo a motho setjhabeng, batho ba ne ba se ba fuwa maemo ho itshetlehile ka bokgoni ba motho.""  ""Bokgoni"" translates to ""ability"" or ""talent"" which is closest in meaning to ""Takatso"" (skill, talent, ability).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Katleho** (Success) - While success was a result, it wasn't the *basis* upon which positions were granted.
*   **B: Sehlopha** (Group/Class) - The change was specifically to move *away* from being based on social class.
*   **D: Maemo** (Status) -  The passage directly contrasts being promoted *because* of your status to being promoted because of your ability.



"
Ke tshebeletso efe ya setjhaba eo hothweng e baka ho se kgotsofale ka ho fetisisa dinaheng tse tswetseng pele?,"The correct answer is **C: Dipalangwang tsa setjhaba** (Public transport).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states people are *generally dissatisfied with public transport systems* and contrasts this with less frequent complaints about water quality or building collapses in developed countries.  The whole question revolves around problems with public transport.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho ka thweng ka dipalangwang tsa setjhaba?","The correct answer is **C: Di baka ditletlebo tse ngata ke ba di sebedisang**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Hoo e ka bang batho bohle ba tletleba ka ditsamaiso tsa dipalanngwang"" (Almost everyone complains about infrastructure systems) and goes on to describe the kinds of complaints people have.  This directly supports the idea that infrastructure systems generate many complaints from those who use them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di ratwa haholo ke bohle ba di sebedisang** - The passage explicitly states the opposite - people *complain* about them.
* **B: Ha di mpe jwalo ka boleng ba metsi** - The passage uses water quality as a comparison to show people *don't* complain as much about those things, meaning infrastructure is complained about *more*.
* **D: Ke mahala dinaheng tse ngata tse tswetseng pele** - The passage does not mention the cost of infrastructure.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang eo ho ka bang thata ho e lekanya ka lebaka la ho se tsitse ha bakhanni?","The correct answer is **D: Phallo ya Sephethephethe** (Traffic flow).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ka bomadimabe, ho ithuta phallo ya sephethephethe ho boima hobane boitshwaro ba mokganni bo ke ke ba hakanngwa ka ho tiiseha ho feletseng.""  This directly translates to ""Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lebelo la sephethephethe** (Traffic speed) - While affected by driver behavior, the passage doesn't say *measuring* speed is difficult, but that behavior influencing flow is unpredictable.
*   **B: Moralo wa tsela** (Road design) - Road design is a physical attribute, not subject to unpredictable human behavior.
*   **C: Tshebetso ya ditsela** (Operation of roads) - This relates to how roads are *managed*, not inherently difficult to measure due to drivers.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sebediswang ha e emela phallo ya sephethephethe ka dipalo?,"The correct answer is **C: Moralo wa ditsela** (Road design).

Here's why:

The passage states that while individual driver behavior is unpredictable, traffic flow can be *modeled mathematically* because drivers generally behave similarly. This modeling relies on relationships between flow, density, and speed, which are all used to *design* roads effectively.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tshebetso ya ditsela** (Traffic operation) - This is a result *of* traffic flow, not the modeling itself.
*   **B: Boitshwaro ba mokganni** (Driver behavior) - The passage explicitly states that this is *too* unpredictable to model directly.
*   **D: Bongata ba Sephethephethe** (Traffic volume) -  This is *one* of the variables involved (flow), but not the overall representation or modeling of traffic flow.



"
Hershey le Chase ba sebedisitse eng ho kenya DNA ya bona? ,"The correct answer is **D: Dikokwana-hloko**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, to get their DNA inside bacteria."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Phosphorous ya mahlasedi:** While phosphorous was *used to label* the DNA, it wasn't the method of delivery.
*   **B: Dintho tsa lefutso:** This is too general. The experiment used a specific type of entity – bacteriophages.
*   **C: Sulfur ye hlahisang mahlasedi:** Sulfur was used to label the protein, not for delivery of DNA.



"
Matla a hore phetoho e fetisetswe baneng e itshetlehile ka eng?,"The correct answer is **C: Mofuta wa phetoho**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""diphetoho di ka ba le diphello tse fapa-fapaneng ho ya ka **mofuta wa phetoho**...Ke diphetoho feela tse leng ho disele tse fetisetsang lefutso tse ka fetisetswang ho bana..."" This directly links the ability of a mutation to be passed on to children to the *type* of mutation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Haeba disele e le dikokwana-hloko:** While germline cells are involved in passing on traits, the passage doesn't say the ability to pass on a mutation *depends* on whether the cell is a germline cell. It explicitly states only mutations *in* germline cells can be passed on.
*   **B: Bohlokwa ba diphatsa tsa lefutso:** The passage mentions the importance of affected chromosome segments, but not as a determinant of whether the mutation is passed on, only its effects.
*   **D: Haeba phetoho e ka baka lefu la sele:** The passage states that mutations not in germline cells can cause cell death or cancer, but doesn't relate this to being passed on to offspring.



"
"Ho latela boitsebiso bo fanweng seratswaneng sena, diphello tse sa tshwaneng tsa ho fetoha ha diphatsa tsa lefutso ha dia itshetleha ka eng?","The correct answer is **D: Mofuta wa phetoho e amehang**.

The passage explicitly states: ""diphello tse fapa-fapaneng di ka ba le diphello tse fapa-fapaneng ho ya ka **mofuta wa phethoho**..."".  This directly addresses what the varying effects depend on.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ke karolo e kae ya diphatsa tsa lefutso e amehang** - While the passage mentions involvement of different parts, it doesn't say the effects *depend* on which part is affected.
*   **B: Haeba disele tse anngweng ke dikokwana-hloko** - The passage doesn't mention kokwana-hloko.
*   **C: Bohlokwa ba diphatsa tsa lefutso tse amehang** - The passage states ""bohlokwa ba karolo ya diphatsa tsa lefutso tse amehang"" is a factor, but it's *in addition to* the type of mutation, not the sole determinant of differing effects.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e neng e se lebaka leo ditso tsa kgale di neng di boloka dipodi?,"The correct answer is **B: Di ne di thusa ho fudisa naha.**

Here's why:

The text states goats were raised for *milk, hair, meat, and hides*. While options A and D are mentioned as reasons, the text *doesn't* state goats were kept to help with farming (fudisa naha).  Option C (companionship) is also not mentioned.

Therefore, option B is the only one *not* supported by the text."
Sepheo sa papadi ya kolofo ke ho nka bonyane ba eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Dibolo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kolofo ke papadi eo ho yona dibapadi di sebedisang melamu hore di otle **dibolo** di kene ka hare ho dikoti."" This directly translates to ""Kolofo is a game where players use clubs to hit **balls** into holes.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Di-Stoke:** While ""stoke"" is a term used in golf, the text doesn't mention it as the game's objective.
*   **C: Nako:** ""Nako"" means time, and time isn't the goal of the game.
*   **D: Dikoti:** The holes (""dikoti"") are where the balls go *into*, they aren't what you're trying to *take*.



"
"Lebaleng la kolofo, jwang bo kgutsufatswa kae?","The correct answer is **A: Sekoting sa leshome le metso e robedi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""di qetella ka sa bo mashome le metso e robedi"" which translates to ""they finish at the eighteenth hole"".  The passage also states that ""jwang bo kutiwa bo be bokgutswanyuane mme bo bitswa the green"" meaning the area close to the hole is cut short and called the green.  Therefore, the green is at the eighteenth hole.



"
Sepheo se tlwaelehileng sa teko ke sefe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho fedisa kgopolo-taba e le nngwe kapa ho feta**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...ho etsa diteko, kapa teko ke tlhahlobo e sebediswang ho **fedisa dikgopolo-taba e le nngwe kapa tse ngata**..."" 

While the other options are related to science, the passage specifically defines the *purpose of an experiment* as eliminating hypotheses.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e sa thuseng ho tataisa dipatlisiso tsa mahlale?","The correct answer is **B: Ho fana ka ditlhaloso (Providing explanations)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the scientific method is about *finding out how the world works scientifically*. It then lists key elements like asking questions, observing, and *testing* (doing experiments). The goal of testing is to *eliminate ideas*.  Giving explanations (Ho fana ka ditlhaloso) doesn't necessarily *guide* scientific research in the same way as those other actions; it's often what happens *after* investigation, not what directs it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mokgwa wa mahlale feela (The scientific method alone)** - The passage explicitly states the scientific method *guides* scientific research.
*   **C: Ho fedisa menahano e ka bang teng (Eliminating ideas)** - The passage says eliminating ideas *is* part of the method and *guides* research.
*   **D: Ho etsa diteko (Doing experiments)** - The passage directly states that doing experiments guides scientific research.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke polelo efe e mabapi le mahodiotswana eo e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **C: Boholo ba mahodiotswana a nka dihora tse fetang tse tharo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that **only two percent** of strong tornadoes last more than three hours. This means the *majority* do *not* last that long.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Mahodiotswana a kgona ho senya ntho e nngwe le e nngwe e haufi le ona** - The passage states they can ""destroy everything in their path"".
*   **B: Mahodiotswana a otla dibaka tse nyane ho feta difefo tse ding** - The passage says ""strong tornadoes strike a smaller area compared to weaker tornadoes"".
*   **D: Mahodiotswana a mang a ka ba le meya ya dikhilomithara tse 300 ka hora** - The passage states some strong tornadoes have winds of 480 km/h (which is over 300 km/h).



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho dipolelo tse latelang e hlalosang ka nepo boholo ba mahodiotswana?","The correct answer is **B: Di bopa meya e ka bang ya dikhilomithara tse 480 ka hora**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Difefo tsena tse mabifi di na le moya o fokang o ka bang 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph)."" This directly describes the wind speed within the tornadoes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hangata a nka dihora tse fetang tse tharo:** The passage says only *two percent* of the strongest tornadoes last over three hours, not that they *generally* do.
*   **C: Di ama dibaka tse kgolo ho feta difefo tse ding:** The passage states the opposite – they cover a *smaller* area than weak tornadoes.
*   **D: Di kgona ho rutla difate fatse:** While the passage says they can uproot trees and lift cars, it doesn't specifically say they can level forests (rutla difate fatse implies a complete flattening).



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo batho ba qadileng ho e etsa lekgolong la bo-16 la dilemo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho sebedisa dilense** (Using lenses).

Here's why:

* The passage states that people have been using lenses to magnify things ""for millennia"" (thousands of years). The key event in the 16th century was the *invention of the telescope* (a specific application of lenses), but people were already familiar with using lenses before that.
* Options B, C, and D are incorrect because:
    * **B: Dintho tse hodisang** (Magnifying things) - This is the *result* of using lenses, not something people started doing in the 16th century.
    * **C: Ho etsa dilense** (Making lenses) - While lens making likely existed before the 16th century, the passage doesn't focus on this being new at that time.
    * **D: Ho etsa dibonela-hole** (Making telescopes) -  The passage specifically states telescopes were *first made* in Europe in the late 16th century. This is a new development, but the question asks what people were already doing.



"
Ke nako e kae batho ba hodisa dintho ka dilense?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka dilemo tse dikete** (For millennia).

The passage states: ""Batho ba ntse ba etsa le ho sebedisa dilense ho hodisa ponahalo ya dintho **dilemo tse dikete-kete**."" This directly translates to ""People have been making and using lenses to magnify things for **millennia**.""
"
"Ho latela seratswana, lehaha la Muhammad le reng ka ditlwaelo tsa hae tsa moya kapa ditekanyetso?","The correct answer is **A: O ananela kgotso le ho behwa ka thoko**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes the cave of Hira as a place where Muhammad went to *reflect* (nahanisisa). It emphasizes the *isolation* and *quiet* of the cave (""o tla be o le mong ka ho feletseng,"" ""O ka bona kapa wa utlwa dintho tse fokolang haholo""). This suggests he valued a peaceful and secluded environment for his spiritual practice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Lerata le ka ntle le ka thusa ho nahana:** The passage actually says the *lack* of external stimuli (noise) helped with reflection, not the noise itself.
*   **C: O ne a hloka nako e nyane haholo a le mong:** The passage portrays the cave as providing complete solitude, suggesting he desired *extensive* time alone.
*   **D: O ne a labalabela ho bonwa le ho utluwa:** The passage contradicts this by describing the cave as a place where he was completely alone and could barely perceive the outside world.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, tshepe e ile ya sebediswa bakeng sa eng pele?","The correct answer is **C: Mabidi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Butle-butle, le ha ho le jwalo, ho ile ha lemuhuwa hore diporo di ka sebetsa hantle ha ne di ka eba le tshepe e nyenyane ka hodimo. Sena se ile sa fetoha mokgwa o tlwaelehileng, empa tshepe e ne e senya mabili a mapolanka a dikariki. Qetellong, mabili a mapolanka a ile a nkelwa sebaka ke mabili a tshepe.""  This clearly indicates steel was first used for the *wheels* (mabidi) of carriages, initially as a small addition, then eventually replacing the wooden wheels entirely.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke hobaneng ha mabidi a lehong a ile a nkelwa sebaka ke mabidi a tshepe?","The correct answer is **D: A ne a qetwa ke tshepe seporong** (They were worn out by the steel in the harness).

Here's why:

The passage states that the steel used in the harness *damaged* the wooden wheels of the carts. This damage led to the need for a more durable wheel, which was steel. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: A ne a eketsa lebelo la dipere** (They increased the speed of the horses) - While the carts *allowed* horses to go faster, the text doesn't say the wooden wheels themselves increased speed.
*   **B: Ane a nkwa a sebetsa hantle haholwanyane** (They were found to work better) - The text doesn't indicate the wooden wheels were inferior in function, only that they were *damaged* by the steel.
*   **C: A ne a khona ho jara merwalo e meholwanyane** (They were able to carry heavier loads) - The text does not mention anything about load capacity related to the wheel material.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e neng e susumetsa batho nakong ya Romanticism?","The correct answer is **B: Thuto ya lefatshe** (The study of the world/nature).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tabeng ya Romanticism, dibaka di ile tsa susumetsa dikelello tsa batho..."" (In the case of Romanticism, places/environments inspired people's feelings...).  This directly translates to nature or the environment being inspirational.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Melao** (Laws) - The passage contrasts Romanticism *against* imposed laws.
*   **C: Ditlwaelo** (Traditions) - While traditions might be *influenced* by place, the passage specifically highlights the direct inspiration from the environment itself.
*   **D: Setso** (Culture) -  The passage says culture *developed* as a result of being inspired by places, it wasn't the initial source of inspiration.



"
Dipolelong tse latelang ke dife tse sa bontsheng kgopolo e akaretsang ya ho iketsetsa diqeto tsa determinism ya tekhenoloji? ,"The correct answer is **A: Diphello tsa theknoloji setjhabeng di itshetlehile ka maemo a bophelo** (The effects of technology on society depend on life circumstances).

Here's why:

* **Technological determinism** argues that technology *shapes* society, often regardless of social factors. Option A suggests the opposite – that social factors (life circumstances) influence how technology affects society.  This directly contradicts the core idea of technological determinism.

Let's look at why the other options *do* align with technological determinism:

* **B: Tswelo pele ya theknoloji ha e susumetswe ke setso** (Technological development is not influenced by culture): This aligns with the idea that technology follows its own path, independent of societal values.
* **C: Theknoloji e na le diphello tsa tlhaho setjhabeng** (Technology has natural effects on society): This is a central tenet of technological determinism – technology inherently causes specific societal changes.
* **D: Tswelo pele ya theknoloji ha ya thehwa tshusumetsong ya dipolotiki** (Technological development is not determined by political influence):  This supports the claim that technology advances on its own trajectory, separate from political control.



Therefore, only option A presents a view *opposed* to the core principles of technological determinism."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e sa amaneng le ho hula seqha?","The correct answer is **B: Letshwao le shebahalang jwalo ka sesupo**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage describes ""up bow"" as looking like a V and ""down bow"" as looking like a staple or square with a base.** A ""sesupo"" (sign/symbol) doesn't directly relate to the visual description of either bow type.

Let's look at why the other options *are* related to the passage:

*   **A: Modumo o bonolo (Soft sound)** - The passage states up bows produce a softer sound.
*   **C: Modumo o matla (Strong sound)** - The passage states down bows produce a strong sound.
*   **D: Ho qala ka senqanqane (Starting at the frog)** - The passage explains down bows start at the frog (where you hold the bow).



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e amanang le modumo o bonolo?","The correct answer is **C: Letshwao le shebahalang jwalo ka-V**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hangata motsu o shebileng hodimo o hlahisa modumo o bonojwana..."" and ""Up e bolela hore o lokela ho qala ntlheng mme o sututse motsu..."". It also says the ""up bow"" looks like a V.  Therefore, the V-shaped mark corresponds to the softer sound.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Letshwao la seqha sa fatshe** - The passage says the ""down bow"" looks like a square, not a mark on the string itself.
*   **B: Ho hula seqha** - This describes the action of a ""down bow"" (pulling the string), associated with a stronger sound.
*   **D: Ho qala moo letsoho la hao le tshwereng seqha** - This describes the starting point for a ""down bow"", again related to the stronger sound.



"
Mesaletsa ya dintho tsa kgale e bontsha hore matsoho a ile a qetella a ikamahanya le maemo hore a sebediswe haholo-holo bakeng sa se latelang?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho tsamaisa dintho (Manipulating objects)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ancient hominid hand bones (2-3 million years old) show a shift in how hands were used – *from* locomotion (like chimps) *to* grasping and manipulating objects. The shorter thumb and straighter finger bones are adaptations for precision grip, crucial for using tools and handling things.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ho jara boima (Bearing weight):** The passage explicitly states hominids *stopped* using their hands for weight-bearing.
*   **C: Motsamao (Locomotion):** Same as above, hands were no longer primarily for movement.
*   **D: Ho tsamaya ka lenonyeletso la monwana (Knuckle-walking):** Chimpanzees do this, and humans evolved *away* from this type of movement.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e hlalosang ka nepo masapo a menwana a chimpanzi? ,"The correct answer is **C: A sebedisetswa ho jara boima ba mmele**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Matsoho le maoto a chimpanzi aa lekana ka boholo le bolelele, se bontshang hore matsoho a sebedisetswa ho jara boima ha e tsamaya ka dinoko.""  This directly translates to ""The hands and feet of a chimpanzee are equal in size and length, indicating that the hands are used to bear weight when walking on knuckles.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: A otlolohile ho feta a batho** - The passage states *human* fingers are straighter.
*   **B: Matsoho le maoto a tsona a fapane ka boholo** - The passage says they are *equal* in size.
*   **D: A sebeliswa haholo-holo bakeng sa ho tsamaisa dintho** - While chimpanzees can manipulate objects, the passage focuses on their use for locomotion (weight-bearing).



"
Kgetho e tlosa phapang e ntjha ya diphatsa tsa lefutso ho tswa letamong lefe?,"The correct answer is **C: Karohano**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Karohano le poelano di isa phetoho pele le morao pakeng tsa dihlopha tse pedi molokong ka mong."" This translates to ""**Isolation** and reconciliation drive change back and forth between the two groups over generations.""  

The passage describes how isolation (karohano) leads to the removal of one gene group by adapting to the environment. Therefore, isolation is the process that eliminates the new difference in gene traits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E patilwe (Copied)** - The passage doesn't mention copying.
*   **B: Ho kopanya hape (Recombination)** - While recombination contributes to variation, it doesn't specifically *remove* a trait.
*   **D: Hlahisitswe (Created)** - The passage discusses the *removal* of a trait, not its creation.



"
Ke tshebetso efe e ikarabellang bakeng sa ho eketsa phapang ya diphatsa tsa lefutso?,"The correct answer is **C: Phetoho (Mutation)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Phetoho ya tsona e eketsa mofuta o motjha o fapaneng wa dijini..."" (Their mutation increases a new, different type of gene...).  This directly links mutation to increasing genetic diversity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Karohano (Separation/Isolation)**: While isolation *can* contribute to divergence over time, the passage states it *results from* the differences created by mutation, not the primary cause of the differences.
*   **B: Ho kopanya hape (Recombination)**: Recombination shuffles existing genes, but doesn't create entirely *new* ones. The passage emphasizes the creation of a *new, different* gene type.
*   **D: Hlahisitswe (Introduced)**: The passage doesn't discuss genes being introduced from an outside source, but rather changes *within* the existing genes.

"Ho latela boitsebiso bo serapeng, ke efe ho tsee eo tshwene e lokelang ho e ja ho rarolla “bothata ba protheine”?","The correct answer is **A: Mahlaku a shweleng (Cooked meat)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that animal sources of protein (meat, insects, eggs) are easily digestible *and* contain all the necessary amino acids. It also mentions that our ancestors likely solved the ""protein problem"" similarly to chimpanzees today - and that chimpanzees get protein from readily available sources like insects. However, the passage specifically notes that plant proteins (like those in beans and fruits) are harder to digest *unless cooked*. The passage implies that cooking meat would have been a key solution for early humans.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dinawa tse tala (Raw beans):** The passage explicitly states that plant proteins are difficult to digest when raw.
*   **C: Ditsiyane (Fruits):**  The passage mentions fruits as a source of plant protein, but states it's hard to get enough amino acids from them without cooking.
*   **D: Dithupa tsa dipalesa (Nut shells):** These are not a source of protein.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mathata afe ho a latelang a sa bakweng ke khaello ya di-amino acid tsa bohlokwa?","The correct answer is **D: Lefu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ho feta moo, ho hloleha ho etsa jwalo ho na le ditlamorao tse bosula: ho hola ka monyebe, ho se fepehe hantle le ho qetella ka lefu."" This directly links a failure to get sufficient amino acids to *death*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mathata a tshilong ya dijo** - The passage suggests problems *with* obtaining the right nutrients, not problems *of* digestion itself.
*   **B: Kgaello ya phepo e nepahetseng** - While the passage mentions cooking makes plant proteins easier to digest, the core problem is the lack of amino acids, not just the inability to cook.
*   **C: Kgolo e tepeletseng maikutlo** - The passage doesn't mention anything about emotional development or excessive growth. It talks about stunted growth (""ho hola ka monyebe"").



"
Ditho tsa mofuta o itseng wa setso hangata di bontsha ho kopana ha tsona le sehlopha jwang?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka ho sebedisa setaele jwalo ka mofuta wa tshwantshetso** (By using style as a form of representation).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that members of a subculture ""often demonstrate their alignment with the subculture through the use of distinctive style and representative symbols, certain unconventional practices, and specific slang.""  This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka ho leka ho kopanya le ba bang** (By trying to connect with others) - While subcultures *do* connect people, the passage doesn’t say this is *how* they demonstrate belonging.
* **B: Ka ho amohela ditumelo tsa bohle ba potolohileng** (By accepting the beliefs of everyone around them) - Subcultures often form *in opposition* to mainstream beliefs, not by accepting them.
* **C: Ka ho amohela ditlwaelo tsa setjhaba** (By accepting national customs) - This is the opposite of what subcultures do; they often have customs that differ from national norms.



"
"Ho ya ka kgopolo e fanweng serapeng sena, ho ka nna ha etsahalang ka ngwana ya ikamahanyang le sehlotshwana sa morabe seo ho nkwang hore se na le boitshwaro bo kotsi?","The correct answer is **B: Ho ka etsahala hore ngwana a kenelle boitshwarong bo kotsi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that children learn about the consequences of their sibling's behavior and these consequences *affect their own behavior*.  The example given shows a child performing worse in school because their sibling is perceived as doing poorly.  Therefore, if a sibling is labeled as having ""dangerous behavior,"" the child is likely to imitate or participate in that behavior, not necessarily avoid it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage suggests the opposite - they internalize the consequences, potentially leading to mimicking the behavior.
*   **C:**  The passage doesn't mention social withdrawal.
*   **D:** The passage focuses on mirroring *behavior*, not avoiding siblings entirely.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana sena, tsebo ya ngwana ya maikutlo a merabe e ka ba le tshusumetso ho efe ho tse latelang?","The correct answer is **B: Boitshwaro ba bona**.

Here's why:

The passage *directly* states that things causing a sibling's distress (""dintho tse bakang kgethollo"") affect their behavior (""di ama boitshwaro ba bona""). The example given illustrates this – children identifying with a younger sibling who is perceived poorly in school also tend to perform worse in school.

Let's look at why the other options are less direct:

* **A: Sehlotshwana sa merabe seo ba kgethang ho ikamahanya le sona:** The passage discusses *identifying* with a sibling, but the core point isn't about the *choice* of who to identify with, but rather the *impact* of that identification.
* **C: Dikamano tsa bona le bana ba bang:**  While potentially affected, the passage doesn't directly address relationships with other children.
* **D: Tlhaloso ya bona ya morabe:** The passage focuses on how the child *reacts* to the perception of their sibling, not how they define ""sibling"" itself.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke efe ho e latelang eo ho ka etsahalang hore ebe e ke ya lumellana le kgodiso ya ngwana ya hlaha?","The correct answer is **A: Ho phela ka boikemelo (Living independently)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""wild children"" often lived in the wilderness, sometimes even raised by animals. This implies they learned to survive on their own, demonstrating independence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tsebo e matla ya ho qoqa (Strong knowledge of begging):** The passage doesn’t mention anything about begging.
* **C: Ditlwaelo tse kgelohileng (Established manners):** Wild children, having grown up without societal interaction, would *lack* established manners.
* **D: Matshwenyeho a setjhaba (Social anxieties):** While they might *develop* social anxieties later, the passage focuses on their initial state of isolation and how it affects their behavior, not pre-existing anxieties.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e hlalosang ka nepo boitshwaro bo hlahla ba bana?","The correct answer is **B: Boitshwaro bo hlaha bo ka bakwa ke ho hloka botswalle**.

Here's why:

The passage states that children raised without human contact (""wild children"") exhibit behaviors *similar to the animals that raised them*, like their fears or distrust of people. This shows the behavior stems from a lack of human interaction and socialization (""ho hloka botswalle"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bongata ba boitshwaro bo hlaha bo bakwa ke ho holofala mmeleng** - The passage mentions physical defects as *a reason* some children were abandoned, but doesn’t say it *causes* the “wild” behaviors.
*   **C: Boitshwaro bo hlaha bo atile feela ho bana ba kwaletsweng ke batswadi ba bona** - The passage says some were abandoned *by* parents, but also mentions children who escaped or were otherwise left alone, and even raised by animals, implying it's not limited to parental abandonment.
*   **D: Boitshwaro bohle bo hlaha bo bakwa ke bokowa bo matla ba kelello** - While parental mental illness is mentioned as a reason for abandonment, it is not presented as the cause for the wild behavior itself.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mekgwa efe ho e latelang e sa tsamaellaneng le temo ya ho iphedisa?","The correct answer is **B: Ho hlahisa dijo ho rekisetsa ba bang (Producing food to sell to others)**.

Here's why:

The passage defines subsistence farming as growing *just enough* food to meet the needs of the household.  Selling crops for profit goes beyond self-sufficiency and moves into commercial farming, which is the opposite of subsistence farming.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with the definition:

*   **A: Ho tsepamisa maikutlo hodima tjhai e kgotsofatsang ditlhoko tsa lelapa la molemi (Focusing on crops that satisfy the farmer's family's needs)** - This *is* the core principle of subsistence farming.
*   **C: Ho tsepamisa maikutlo ho tjhai e ngata ho fapana le mekgwa e tswetseng pele (Focusing on a variety of crops rather than advanced methods)** - The passage mentions crop rotation and simple methods, aligning with this.
*   **D: Ho fumana peo sebakeng sa molemi (Obtaining land for the farmer)** -  The passage states that subsistence farming utilizes the land available, so securing land is relevant.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e hlalosang ka nepo mokgwa wa ho iphedisa ka temo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ke tsamaiso ya tlhahiso ya dijo ka ho feletseng** (It is a complete food production system).

Here's why:

The passage defines 'temo e nyane' as farming done to produce enough food *only* to meet the needs of the household. This makes it a self-sufficient, complete system for providing food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: E sebedisa mekgwa e ikgethang ho eketsa dijalo** (It uses special methods to increase yields) - The passage says it uses *simple* methods to increase yields, not necessarily 'special' ones.
* **C: E dumella ditsebi tsa temo ho arolelana dijalo tsa bona ho pholletsa le sebaka sa bona** (It allows farming experts to share their crops throughout their area) -  The passage doesn't mention sharing crops.
* **D: E ntse e sebediswa ke bo ra dipolase dinaheng tse ding** (It is still used by farmers in other countries) - While the passage mentions it's still used in many developing countries, it doesn't define that *as* the practice itself.



"
Ho etela musiamo ho tla wela tlasa mofuta ofe wa bohahlaudi?,"The correct answer is **C: Bohahlaudi ba setso (Cultural Tourism)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that ""If a person's purpose for visiting a certain place is to learn its history and culture, this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism."" Museums are directly related to learning history and culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bohahlaudi ba kgwebo (Business Tourism):** This refers to travel for work-related purposes.
*   **B: Bohahlaudi ba boithabiso (Recreational Tourism):** While museums *can* be enjoyable, the primary goal isn't just relaxation and fun, but learning.
*   **D: Bohahlaudi ba kantle (Adventure Tourism):** This involves outdoor activities and risk-taking, which isn't what a museum visit is about.



"
"Ho latela seratswana sena, ke eng e ka nnang ya e-ba ntho e tlang pele ho baeti ba boithabiso?","The correct answer is **B: Ho phomola mesebetsing ya bona ya letsatsi le letsatsi** (To relax from their daily routines).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that ""Bohahlaudi ba Boikgathollo"" (Recreational tourists) go to different places ""to relax and enjoy themselves."" This makes relaxation the primary motivation for this type of tourist.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho ikakgela ka setotswana moetlong wa lehae** (To photograph an artifact in a local home) - The passage doesn't mention this.
*   **C: Ho bona dibaka tsa bohlokwa** (To see important places) - While recreational tourists *might* visit landmarks, it's not their primary goal.
*   **D: Ho utlwisisa nalane ya sebaka** (To understand the history of the area) - This describes ""bohahlaudi ba setso"" (cultural tourists), not recreational tourists.



"
Ke eng e bolelwang serapeng e le ntho e thusitseng ho fokotsa tshabo ya phetoho ka hare ho kereke ya lehae?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho hopola mehlala e atlehileng ya boitshwaro ba borakgwebo** (Remembering successful examples of entrepreneurial behavior).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ditaba tse jwalo tsa katleho di fokoditse ho tshaba phetoho, di be di etsa hore batho ba be le mohopolo o mo ntle wa phetoho nakong e tlang."" This directly links *stories of success* (specifically entrepreneurial behavior in this context) to a reduction in fear of change.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ho fumana temohisiso ka batho ba ileng ba susumetsa setso sa mokgatlo** (Gaining understanding of people who influenced the culture of the organization) - While understanding influencers is helpful, the passage doesn't say this specifically reduced fear of change.
*   **C: Ho sibolla matla a kgannang mokgatlo** (Discovering forces opposing the organization) - This is the opposite of what would reduce fear; it would likely *increase* it.
*   **D: Ho utlwisisa nalane ya mokgatlo** (Understanding the history of the organization) - Understanding history is valuable, but the passage highlights *successful past actions* as the key factor in lessening fear of change.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho utlwisisa histori ya motho ho ka thusa ka eng?","The correct answer is **C: Ho fumana maikutlo a sebaka ka hare ho mokgatlo** (To gain a sense of place within the organization).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""bonnyane ho thusa batho ho ba le mohopolo wa hore ba ne ba le hokae historing ya mokgatlo."" (at least to help people have an idea of where they were in the history of the organization). This directly relates to understanding one's place within the organization.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ho fokotsa tshabo ya phetoho** (To reduce fear of change): While the passage *mentions* success stories reducing fear of change, it's a *result* of understanding history, not the primary benefit of understanding a person's history itself.
*   **B: Ho matlafatsa ditekanyetso** (To strengthen regulations): The passage discusses laws/rules, but not necessarily strengthening them through personal histories.
*   **D: Ho ntlafatsa boitshwaro ba borakgwebo** (To improve the behavior of entrepreneurs): While entrepreneurship is mentioned, the focus isn’t on improving their behavior, but on learning from past successes.



"
Ke efe ho dipolelo tse latelang e hlalosang ka nepo mokgwa wa ho ithuta wa morao-rao?,"The correct answer is **D: Ha ho na botlalo thutong** (There is no totality in learning).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that learning is a process of exchange *between* the learner and the information, and that there's no single ""right"" way to learn or even something *to* learn in a rigid sense.  It highlights how often we passively receive information (like from TV) that we can't actually *apply* or use.  This directly supports the idea that learning isn't about achieving complete knowledge or mastery, but is ongoing and contextual.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Diphihlelo tse ding tsa ho ithuta di molemo ho feta tse ding** (Some learning experiences are better than others) - The passage doesn’t say experiences differ in quality, but rather that learning happens in the interaction and *application* of knowledge, which it implies is often missing.
* **B: Ho ithuta ho lokela ho tsepamiswa dinthong tseo re dumelang hore di tla re etsahalla** (Learning should focus on things we believe will happen to us) - The passage doesn't suggest limiting learning to only what's immediately relevant. It criticizes learning *without* application, not learning about things we might not immediately use.
* **C: Mekgwa e meng ya ho ithuta e molemo ho feta e meng** (Some learning methods are better than others) -  The passage argues *against* a ""best"" way to learn, stating there isn't one.



"
Ke efe ya dipolelo tse latelang e sa bontsheng mokgwa wa ho ithuta wa morao-rao?,"The correct answer is **D: Tsebo eo mohlomong le ka mohla re ke keng ra e sebedisa e ntse e le molemo ho ithuta.**

Here's why:

The passage strongly argues *against* learning things you won't use. It criticizes television programs that present information about things viewers can't *do* with that information (fixing cars, building decks, traveling to Peru, repairing a neighbor's roof). The central idea is that learning is most effective when it's connected to practical application and a dialogue between the learner and the knowledge. Option D directly contradicts this idea.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with the passage:

*   **A: Ho na le mekgwa e mengata ya ho ithuta ditaba** - The passage starts by stating there is no single ""right"" way to learn, supporting this option.
*   **B: Boiphihlelo bo itseng ba ho ithuta bo lokela ho behwa pele ho bo bong** - The passage implies this by suggesting learning happens through interaction and that a passive reception of information isn't enough.
*   **C: Boiphihlelo ba ho ithuta bo itshetlehile hodima moithuti le tsebo e hlahisitsweng** - This is a direct restatement of the passage's core argument about learning being a collaborative process.

"Ka mora ho tsoha ka boomo nakong ya nako e tlwaelehileng ya ho robala, ke efe ho tsee e neng e ka kenakenana le tshebetso ya ho sitisa boroko?","The correct answer is **B: Ho sebedisa ntlwana le ho kgutlela betheng**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a technique to disrupt sleep by intentionally waking up *just* enough to get out of bed, forcing full wakefulness.  Option B directly contradicts this.  Pressing snooze and going back to bed defeats the purpose of the technique, as it allows you to fall back into deep sleep.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho bala hora le halofo pele o robala hape** - The passage doesn't mention reading.
*   **C: Ho tima alamo setulong sa hao sa bosiu ebe o robala hape metsotso e mashome a mabedi hamorao** - This is very similar to the snooze button, and also defeats the purpose.
*   **D: Ho tsoha ho ya nwa metsi ka botlolo setulong sa hao sa bosiu** -  This *supports* the disruption technique; getting out of bed to drink water is consistent with the idea of forcing yourself to wake up.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo e seng tlhaloso e nepahetseng ya tshitiso ya boroko?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka mora ho tsoha, sepheo ke ho kgutlela borokong ka mora dihora tse pedi.**

Here's why:

The passage describes *wake-back-to-bed* (or delayed sleep phase) as waking up briefly and then going *back to sleep for a shorter time* (10-60 minutes). It *doesn't* say the goal is to stay awake for two hours. 

Let's look at why the other options are accurate based on the passage:

*   **A: E ka thehwa ho biorhythm** - The passage implies it aligns with your natural sleep patterns.
*   **B: Sepheo ke ho se tsohe ka botlalo** - The text explicitly states it's *not* a full wake-up, but a gentle prompting.
*   **C: Mokgwa ona o etsahala nakong hya ho robala ha hao ho tlwaelehileng** - The passage specifies it happens during your usual sleep time.



"
"Ha boko bo ntse bo leka ho lora ka mokgwa o hlakileng kgafetsa, ho eketswa eng?","The correct answer is **D: Nako dipakeng tsa maemo a REM** (Time between REM stages).

Here's why:

The passage states that the sensation of waking up and being startled is caused by the body finding itself in unusual positions *because* of increased time between REM sleep and the next sleep stage.  If the brain tries to dream/REM more frequently, there's more opportunity for that gap to increase, leading to more startling awakenings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Palo ya maemo a REM** (Number of REM stages) - While having few REM stages is *mentioned* as a potential problem, the passage doesn't say increased frequency of attempts to dream *increases* the number of REM stages.
* **B: Maemo a matla** (Strong stages) - The passage doesn't discuss the *strength* of REM stages.
* **C: Bolelele ba boemo ba ho hlaphohelwa** (Length of the falling asleep stage) - This is unrelated to the described phenomenon.



"
Ke ditshusumetso dife ho tse latelang tse mpe tse ka bang mmeleng khafetsa ha o lora?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho fokotseha ha nako dipakeng tsa maemo a REM** (Decreased time between REM stages).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the phenomenon (feeling like you're dreaming or experiencing something intense) is ""caused by the dreams you have which increases the time between REM sleep.""  Therefore, frequent false awakenings/intense experiences are linked to *reduced* time between REM stages, not increased or REM being simply low or high overall.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: REM e fokotsehile ka bosiu bo bong** (REM decreased on a single night): The passage says a *lack* of REM overall can contribute to the problem, but doesn't say the experiences are caused by decreased REM *on a single night*.
* **C: Ho itshetleha ka toro e hlakileng** (Clear recall of a dream): While you might remember the experience, the passage focuses on the *cause* of the experience, not just the memory of it.
* **D: Ho eketseha ha REM ka bosiu bo bong** (REM increased on a single night): The passage states the opposite—the issue is linked to changes *between* REM stages, not an increase in REM itself.

"Ho latela seratswana, dihlopha tse tlwaelehileng le dihlopha tsa sebele di tshwana jwang?","The correct answer is **A: Dihlopha tseo ka bobedi di lebelletswe ho bapala maemong a tshwanang**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dihlopha tsa k’homputha di tshwara ka ditekanyetso tse tshwanang tsa botle, ho tshwana le dihlopha tse tlwaelehileng..."" This directly translates to ""Computer groups operate under similar standards of conduct, just like traditional groups...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage states computer groups have *more* independence, not that both types have different levels of independence.
*   **C:** The ""invisible group"" is specific to *computer* groups, not traditional ones.
*   **D:** The passage states computer groups can meet at various, potentially confusing, times - implying they *don't* necessarily operate in a single timeframe.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke polelo efe e mabapi le dihlopha tse kopanang ka k’homputha le ka sebele eo e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **A: Dihlopha tse tlwaelehileng hangata di tshwarwa ka maemo a hodimo.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that computer-mediated groups share *similar* norms to traditional groups, but there is a *difference*. It doesn't say traditional groups are held to *higher* standards.
*   **B** is true: The passage explicitly states that computer groups often function as a communication link to real-life groups.
*   **C** is true: The passage states members of computer groups tend to have *more* autonomy than members of traditional groups.
*   **D** is true: The passage indicates that varying times and locations can be a characteristic of computer-mediated groups.

Therefore, option **A** is the only statement *not* supported by the text."
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo e seng yona eo dikgopolo tsa tsutsumetso di theilweng hodima yona?,"The correct answer is **A: Ditakatso tse ntjha tse phethahalang ha motho e se e le motho e moholo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that theories of motivation are based on understanding *what moves people* and *what satisfies them*. It further explains they look at *needs and predispositions developed as people mature* and *what in their environment will lead them to act*.  Option A, ""Accomplishments achieved when one is already an adult,"" isn't the *foundation* of motivation theories - it's often a *result* of being motivated.

Let's look at why the other options ARE part of the foundation:

* **B: Kamoo tikoloho ya motho e amang diketso tsa bona (How a person's environment influences their actions)** - The passage directly states this is a key aspect of understanding motivation.
* **C: Ditlhoko tse ka hare (Internal needs)** -  The passage says theories are built on the idea that people have ""certain needs""
* **D: Ho utlwisisa dintho tseo batho ba di ratang (Understanding what people like)** - This aligns with understanding what ""satisfies"" people, a core element of motivation theories.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo e seng ntho ya rule of third?,"The correct answer is **B: Ho theha bophelo le matla ka hara senepe** (To create life and energy within the canvas).

Here's why:

The passage explains the rule of thirds as a *guideline for composition* – how to *place* the subject within the frame.  It's about strategic placement to achieve balance and dynamism.

*   **A:**  This aligns with the description – the rule helps decide *where* to put elements.
*   **C:** This also aligns – the rule aims for effective placement.
*   **D:**  The rule creates *order* by suggesting a structure for composition.

However, while good composition *can* lead to a more energetic and vibrant image, the rule of thirds itself doesn't directly *create* life and energy. It's a tool to *arrange* elements in a way that *can* enhance those qualities. Therefore, it's not a fundamental part of the rule itself.

Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa hlaloseng mokgwa wa ho nka dinepe wa 35mm?,"The correct answer is **C: E na le karolo e fapaneng ya dikarolo ho feta dijithale tse ngata tse tlwaelehileng**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the *aspect ratio* of 35mm film (3:2) and how it relates to digital sensor formats. It states that many common digital formats *match or closely approximate* this ratio. This implies that 35mm doesn't have a radically different component structure than most digital sensors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E ntse e hlahiswa:** The passage explicitly states ""Se ntse se etswa le kajeno"" (It is still produced today).
*   **B: E amohetswe ke dijithale tsa khamera ya dijithale:** The passage says the ratio is *incorporated* into digital camera sensor formats.
*   **D: Ke fomate e tsebahalang haholo lefatsheng:** The passage describes it as a popular format, especially historically.

"Ho latela seratswana, ha bahlahisi ba ntse ba eketsa boleng ba tlhahiso ya lense, dilense tsa zoom di ntlafaditswe jwang?","The correct answer is **C: Boleng ba tsona ba dinepe bo tshwana le ba dilense tse nang le bolelele bo tsitsitseng.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sena se dumella dilense tsa zoom ho nka dinepe tsa maemo a hodimo ha ho bapiswa le dilense tsa boholo ba sebaka bo tsitsitseng.""  This directly translates to ""This allows zoom lenses to take higher-quality pictures compared to lenses with a fixed focal length.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Di na le lebelo le hodimo la lense** - The passage actually states the opposite: ""Bothata bo bong ba dilense tsa zoom ke hore lebelo le hodimo la dilense hangata le a fokotseha."" (One problem with zoom lenses is that their maximum speed is often reduced.)
*   **B: Di bonolo ho di sebedisa maemong a kganya e fokolang** -  Again, the passage says they are *more difficult* to use in low light.
*   **D: Di na le ho rarahana ho fokolang ho feta dilense tsa mantlha** - The passage discusses focal complexity as a *problem* with zoom lenses, meaning they are *more* complex, not less.

"Ho ipapisitswe le tlhaiso-leseding e serapeng, ke neng moo lense ya zoom e ka bang molemo ho feta lense e kgolo?","The correct answer is **A: Haeba lesoba le phahameng ke lona le tlang pele**.

Here's why:

The passage states that zoom lenses allow manufacturers to reach *higher levels of focal length* than prime lenses. This means zoom lenses are better when you need a long focal length (i.e., high zoom).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Haeba o batla dikarolo tse fokolang tsa lense:** The passage states zoom lenses *require* more elements.
* **C: Haeba o sa batle ho sebedisa kganya maemong a lefifi:** The passage says zoom lenses often have slower apertures, making them *harder* to use in low light.
* **D: Haeba o batla ho feta tsepamiso e complexity:**  The passage says zoom lenses *have* focal complexity; you wouldn't choose them *for* that.

Ke efe ho tse latelang e ke keng ya nkwa e le tlhaloso e nepahetseng ya tumelo ya sephiri sa moya?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho na le taba ya ho ba le kgotso le maemo a monate a kelello (There is an element of having peace and pleasant mental states)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes a *direct experience* of the divine, a deep understanding, and even ecstatic states. While peace and pleasant feelings *might* be *results* of such an experience, they are not the core defining characteristic of spiritual seeking as described in the text. The passage focuses on a striving for truth and a direct connection with the divine.

Let's look at why the other options are correct descriptions, based on the passage:

* **B: Balatedi ba sephiri sa moya ba batla tlhokomediso e hlokolosi ya nnete ya moya (Followers of spiritual seeking desire careful attention to the truth of the spirit)** – This is directly stated in the passage.
* **C: Balatedi ba tumelo ya sephiri sa moya ba ka sebedisa mekgwa e tla thusa ho hodisa temohisiso ya bona ya nnete ya bomodimo (Followers of spiritual seeking can use practices to help nourish their understanding of the truth of the divine)** – The passage mentions ""certain ways of living, or practices designed to encourage such an experience.""
* **D: Kgatello ya ho batla phihlelo e tobileng ya botho e tshwana le mefuta e meng ya tumelo le borapedi ba bodumedi (The emphasis on seeking direct personal experience is common to many other forms of religion and spirituality)** –  The passage specifically says this is how spiritual seeking is *differentiated* from other beliefs.

"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang eo e seng taba ya tumelo ya saphiri sa moya?","The correct answer is **B: Ho phehella temohisiso ka diphihlelo tse arolelanwang, tsa setjhaba**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that mystical experiences are about *direct, personal* connection with the divine. It emphasizes an individual's unique state of understanding, often characterized by deeply personal feelings.  

Option B focuses on *shared, communal* experiences, which contradicts the core idea of a mystical experience being individual and direct.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with the passage:

*   **A: Ho batla boikutlo ba nneteng ya bomodimo** - The passage says seekers want a direct experience of the divine.
*   **C: Ho toboketsa boemo bo monate ba kelello** - The passage mentions experiences that can be fulfilling, deep, joyful, or even ecstatic.
*   **D: Ho phehella kutlwisiso e hlokolosi ya Modimo** - The passage describes a search for a deep understanding of God.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang ya qadileng setjhaba sa temo?","The correct answer is **C: Batho ba Maori ba tswang Polynesia**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kgopolo ena e ne e re batho ba Maori ba falletse ho tloha Polynesia ka Dikepe tse Kgolo mme ba nkela batho ba Mamoriori New Zealand, ba qala setjhaba sa temo.""  This directly says the Maori from Polynesia established the agricultural society.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bamoriori ho tswa New Zealand** - The passage clarifies that the Moriori *originated* from New Zealand (as a section of the Maori), but the initial settlement and farming were done by the Maori coming *from* Polynesia.
*   **B: Bamoriori ho tswa Dihlekehlekeng tsa Chatham** - The Moriori on the Chatham Islands developed a distinct culture *after* migrating from New Zealand.
*   **D: Bamoriori ho tswa naheng e kgolo** - While they eventually came from a larger landmass (Polynesia via New Zealand), the immediate founders of the agricultural society are described as the Maori.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, sehlopha se neng se tsoma moas e bile baahi ba pele ba sebaka sefe?","The correct answer is **B: New Zealand**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nako e telele lekgolong la dilemo la leshome le metso e robong le la mashome a mabedi, hone ho dumelwa hore baahi ba New Zealand e ne e le batho ba Maori, bao ba neng ba tsoma dinonyana tse kgolo tse bitswang di-moa.""  This directly says the Maori, who ate moa, were believed to be the first inhabitants of New Zealand.
"
Ke boemo bofe bo neng bo ka sebedisa mokgwa wa Pureland wa origami molemong wa foldara?,"The correct answer is **A: Foldara e kgetha ho etsa memeno e mengata ka nako e le nngwe**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states Pureland origami has the restriction that *only one fold can be made at a time*, and re-folding is not allowed.  Therefore, a folder would be frustrated by a method that encourages/requires multiple folds simultaneously.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Foldara e na le tsebo e tswetseng pele ya ho sebetsa** - The passage says it was designed for people *without* skill or mobility. Advanced skill isn't relevant.
* **C: Foldara e theha mokgwa wa origami o hlokang memeno ya ho kgutlela morao** - Pureland origami *already* prohibits reverse folds – it's a defining characteristic.
* **D: Foldara e se e lekile hanngwe kapa habedi feela pele** - The passage doesn't mention anything about practice or attempts.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa hlaloseng ka nepo mokgwa ya Pureland wa origami?,"The correct answer is **A: E etseditswe difoldara tse nang le boiphihlelo**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Origami ya Pureland was *created to help people with limited dexterity or mobility issues*.  This directly contradicts the idea that it was designed for experienced folders.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

*   **B: Mokgwa ona ha o kenyelletse mameno a ho kgotlela morao** - The text states that ""mameno a rarahaneng jwaloka ho mena o kgutlela morao ha aa dumellwa"".
*   **C: Mameno a tlameha ho ba le dibaka tse otlolohileng** - The text indicates all folds go forward only.
*   **D: Ke mokgwa o motle bakeng sa difoldara tse nang le tsebo e fokolang** - The text states that it was designed to help people with dexterity issues, implying a simpler method.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke sebaka sefe se sa amaneng le Ntshetsopele Kgohlong ya Indus?","The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

Here's why:

The passage states that some archaeologists call the civilization the ""Harappan Civilization *because* Harappa was the first site excavated in the 1920s."" This means Harappa is a location *within* the Indus Valley Civilization, not a place separate from it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Noka ya Sarasvati:** The passage explicitly mentions the Sarasvati River and the debate about renaming the civilization to Indus-Sarasvati.
*   **C: Dibaka tsohle tse ka leboya botjhabela ho Afghanistan:** The passage states the civilization included parts of northeastern Afghanistan.
*   **D: Boholo ba Pakistan ya kajeno:** The passage states the civilization included most of modern-day Pakistan.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa bolelwang e le lebitso le ka bang teng bakeng sa ntshetsopele ya Mehla ya Bronze e boletsweng serapeng?,"The correct answer is **D: Ntshetsopele ya Phula ya Indus**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions the following names used for the civilization:

*   **Ntshetsopele ya Noka ya Indus** (Indus Valley Civilization)
*   **Ntshetsopele ya Indus-Sarasvati** (Indus-Sarasvati Civilization)
*   **Ntshetsopele ya Harappa** (Harappan Civilization)

The passage doesn't mention ""Ntshetsopele ya Phula ya Indus"" (Flower of the Indus Civilization) as a possible name. Therefore, that is the name not mentioned in the text."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e hlahisang molemo wa nako e telele?","The correct answer is **A: Ho sebedisana le ba bang (Cooperating with others)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that situations where many benefit will *continue* to be fruitful in the long run by cooperating. It contrasts this with prioritizing self-interest, suggesting cooperation is the better choice. The passage emphasizes that long-term benefit comes from systems where many people gain, and that comes from cooperation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ho etelletsa dithahasello tsa hao pele (Prioritizing your own interests)** - The passage suggests this is *less* beneficial in the long run than cooperation.
* **C: Ho hatisa se neng se tla tswela batho ba fokolang molemo ho feta ba bangata (Emphasizing what would benefit a few over many)** - This is the opposite of the passage's core message.
* **D: Ho hlokomela hore meharo e ka ba molemo (Recognizing that kindness can be good)** - While kindness (meharo) is implied, the passage focuses specifically on the *practical benefit* of cooperation, not just its ethical value.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang eo motho a ka e etelletsang pele haeba a tsepamisitse maikutlo melemong ya hanghang?","The correct answer is **B: Tshebedisano (Cooperation)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the best choice is to ""sebedisana le ba bang"" (cooperate with others).  It argues that situations where many benefit will also have more opportunities that can be seized through cooperation. The passage suggests focusing on immediate gains leads to realizing the benefit of cooperation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho hloka boithati (Selfishness)** - The passage *contrasts* acting selfishly with cooperating, implying selfishness is *not* the path to follow.
* **C & D: kutlwisisano (Understanding)** - While understanding can be helpful, the passage's core argument is about the *action* of cooperating, not just understanding. The immediate benefit is realized through cooperation.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang ya ileng a kwahela karolo e kholo ya ditshenyehelo tsa ntwa?","The correct answer is **B: Dibanka tsa Wall Street**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the funds collected through taxes from the Philippine government were used to benefit Wall Street banking houses. This indicates that Wall Street banks were the primary beneficiaries of the war expenses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mmuso wa Philippine:** The passage states the Philippine government *collected* the taxes, but the money went *to* Wall Street, not stayed with the Philippine government.
*   **C: Puso ya bokolone ya US:** While the US colonial government imposed the taxes, the passage emphasizes where the money ended up.
*   **D: Batho ba Filipino:** The Filipino people *paid* the taxes, but they didn't benefit from the expenses. They were exploited.



"
Ke nako efe e tlileng pele ho mehla ya Templars?,"The correct answer is **C: Mehla e Bohareng ya Pele** (Early Middle Ages).

Here's why:

The passage states the Templars arose *during* the High Middle Ages (1000-1300 AD) and that the High Middle Ages came *after* the Early Middle Ages. Therefore, the Early Middle Ages came *before* the time of the Templars.



"
Ke nako efe e tlileng ka mora dilemo tsa Templars?,"The correct answer is **A: Qetellong ya Mehla e Bohareng** (The Late Middle Ages).

The passage states the Templars existed *before* the end of the Middle Ages, and that the end of the Middle Ages is considered to be around 1500 AD. Therefore, the period that came *after* the time of the Templars is the Late Middle Ages.
"
Ke phekolo efe kapa mokgwa ofe oo ho sa bolelwang hore o ne o sebediswa ke dingaka kapa dingaka tse buwang nakong ya Mmuso wa Roma?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho phekola lefu la kgatello ya kelello ka mora ho sithabela maikutlo ka meriana e sa tshwaneng e robatsang.**

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses pain management (morphine, scopolamine), surgical techniques to prevent infection, and controlling bleeding. It *does not* mention using medications to treat mental health conditions like depression or emotional distress.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage specifically states scopolamine was obtained from the henbane plant.
*   **C:** The passage mentions techniques to *prevent* bleeding, implying an understanding of blood flow through veins.
*   **D:** The passage explicitly states doctors had expertise in amputations to save patients from gangrene.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e sa amaneng le tswelopele e entsweng lefapheng la bongaka nakong ya Mmuso wa Roma?","The correct answer is **C: Theho ya dipetlele tsa ho ithuta** (The establishment of teaching hospitals).

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:**
    *   ""Dingaka di ile tsa qala ho thaothwa ke Moemphera Augustus"" (Doctors began to be sponsored by Emperor Augustus) - aligns with option D.
    *   ""tsa theha Masupatsela a Bongaka a Maroma a pele a neng a sebetsa kamora masetlapelo a dintwa"" (to found the first Roman Medical Schools that operated after battles) - aligns with option A.
    *   ""Hore ebe mmuso wa Roma o ne a amehile ka sesole ho ile ha thusa hore ho ntshetswe pele ditaba tsa bongaka."" (The Roman empire’s involvement with the military helped advance medical knowledge) - aligns with option B.

*   **The passage does *not* mention** the establishment of teaching hospitals. It refers to ""Masupatsela a Bongaka"" (Medical Schools) which operated after battles to treat soldiers, but not hospitals specifically designed for teaching.

Therefore, the answer is C."
Bokgoni ba ho bona bo itshetlehile ka eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Ditho tsa kutlo tsa tsamaiso ya pono**.

Here's why:

The passage directly states: ""Pono, kapa bokgoni ba ho bona bo itshetlehile ka **ditho tsa kutlo tsa tsamaiso ya pono kapa mahlo**."" (Vision, or the ability to see, depends on the sensory organs of the visual system or eyes.)

While the other options are *mentioned* in the passage as factors related to different types of eyes and their function, they are *results* of how the sensory organs work, not what sight *depends* on.



"
Phapang ya sebopeho sa mahlo pakeng tsa dintho tse phelang e itshetlehile ka eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Ditlhoko tsa ntho e phelang** (The needs of the living thing).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dibopeho tse fapaneng tsa mahlo, tse fapaneng ka ho rarahana ho itshetlehile ka **se hlokahalang ho mofuta wa ntho e phelang**."" (Different eye shapes, differing in structure, depend on **what is needed by the type of living thing**).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Karabelo ya fapaneng bo tlohang ntlheng e nngwe ho ya ho e nngwe** (Different responses from point to point) - This describes a *result* of the different eye shapes, not the reason *for* them.
*   **C: Boemo ba ho bona ka ho hlaka** (Clarity of vision) - While eye shape affects clarity, it's not the fundamental *reason* for the differences.
*   **D: Ho rarahana ha ntho e phelang** (The structure of the living thing) -  This is too broad. The *needs* of the organism drive the structure, not the structure itself.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana seo, ke polelo efe e buang ka Sikhism e sa bontsheng bolumedi ka nepo?","The correct answer is **A: Bosikhi e bile phello ya karohano ya maqulwana ka hara neano ya Mahindu (Sikhism was the result of a schism from within the Hindu tradition)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Masikh a nka tumelo ya wona e fapane le Bohindu, leha a dumela hore metso ya wona e Sehindung ebile ba sebedisa meetlo ya sona."" (Sikhs consider their religion different from Hinduism, although they believe its roots are in Hinduism and they use its rituals.)
* This means Sikhism *diverged* from Hinduism, but wasn't simply a ""schism"" (a formal split).  It developed a distinct identity while still acknowledging Hindu origins. The text doesn't portray it as a contentious split, but rather a new path *emerging* from within Hinduism.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **B:** ""Guru ke karolo ya bohlokwa e ikgethang ho Bosikhi"" (Guru is a uniquely important element in Sikhism) - The text explicitly states this: ""...ho Sesikh, e nkile boemo ba pele jwaloka tumelo e ka sehloohong ya Masikh.""
* **C:** ""Diguru tse robong di ile tsa latela ka mora mothehi wa bolumedi, Guru Nanak"" (The ten gurus followed after the founder of the religion, Guru Nanak) - The text directly states: ""Ho ile ha latela tlhahlamano e nngwe ya di-guru tse robong.""
* **D:** ""Ditlwaelo tse ding tsa Masikhi di thehilwe Bohindung"" (Some Sikh practices are based on Hinduism) - The text says: ""...ba sebedisa meetlo ya sona."" (they use its rituals).



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e nkwang e le karolo ya motheo ya tsamaiso ya tumelo ya Bosikh?","The correct answer is **A: Kgopolo ya guru**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Guru ke tshobotsi ya motheo ya madumedi wohle a India empa ho Sesikh, e nkile boemo ba pele jwaloka tumelo e ka sehloohong ya Masikh."" This means the concept of the Guru is central and foundational to the Sikh faith.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ditlwaelo tsa Mahindu:** While the passage mentions Sikhism originating from a Hindu background and utilizing some of its practices, it also notes that Sikhs hold *different* beliefs than Hindus.
* **C: Ho hana ho amohela madumedi a mang a India:** The passage doesn't state Sikhs reject other Indian religions, only that they have differing beliefs.
* **D: Ho bua puo ya Sepunjabi:**  While *Gurmat* is a Punjabi term, the passage doesn't state that speaking Punjabi is a fundamental part of the faith itself.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke eng eo bana ba nang le bothata ba ho se tsepamise kelello (ADD)ho ka bang thata ho tsepamisa maikutlo ho yona?","The correct answer is **A: Mosebetsi wa sekolo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bana ba tshwerweng ke lena la ADD ba thahafallwa ho tsepamisa mohopolo dinthong tse kang **mosebetsi wa sekolo**...""  This directly answers the question.

While the passage *also* mentions they *can* focus on things they enjoy (playing, watching shows), the question asks what they have *difficulty* focusing on.



"
"Ho latela seratswana sena, ke hobaneng ha bana ba nang le bothata ba ho se tsepamise Maikutlo ba atisa ho kopanela boitshwarong bo kotsi?","The correct answer is **A: Ho fokotsa khatello ya maikutlo (To relieve mental pressure)**.

The passage states: ""...ba etsa dintho tse kotsi, ba dulela ho lwana, ebile ba phephetsa bolaodi ka sepheo sa ho hlasimolla kelello, hobane dikelello tsa bona di ke ke tsa hlasimollwa ka mekgwa e tlwaelehileng.""  This directly translates to them engaging in risky behavior *in order to stimulate their minds* because normal ways of stimulation aren't enough. This is a way to relieve the pressure and restlessness they feel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ho ba thusa ho ikopanya le dithaka (To help them connect with peers):** The passage actually says ADD *affects* relationships with peers due to misunderstandings.
* **C: Ho fumana tlhokomelo ho batswadi ba bona (To get attention from their parents):** The passage doesn't mention seeking parental attention as a motivation.
* **D: Ho susumetsa boko ba bona (To stimulate their brains):** While true, this is the *result* of the behavior, not the primary *reason* as stated in the text. The underlying driver is relieving mental pressure.



"
"Ho latela boitsebiso bo serapeng, ke efe ho ee eo e seng mohlala wa ho ruta wa sekafole?","The correct answer is **B: Morupedi wa SAT**.

Here's why:

The passage defines self-tutoring as *supportive* assistance while learning something new, like using software or starting a project. It emphasizes that it's *not* the method of learning itself, but a tool to help. It compares a tutor to a small Microsoft Office paperclip – offering help *while* you're already trying to learn.

Let's look at why the other options are examples of self-tutoring *aids* or fall within the definition:

*   **A: Thupelo qalong ya papadi ya khompiyutha (Computer programming tutorial):**  A tutorial provides assistance while you learn to program - aligning with the definition of self-tutoring.
*   **C: Lenaneo la Phuputso le ikemetseng (Self-paced research program):** This program guides and assists you through research, which is a new learning experience.
*   **D: Mokwetlisi e monyane wa liki (Small piano tutor):** This aids the user in learning something new.

A **Morupedi wa SAT (SAT tutor)**, however, is primarily about *teaching* a standardized test. While it involves learning, the focus is on delivering instruction, testing knowledge, and ultimately, *being taught*. It's the primary method of learning, not a supportive aid *during* self-directed learning. Therefore, it doesn’t fit the passage’s definition of self-tutoring.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa hlaloseng ka nepo mohopolo wa mokgwa wa ho ruta wa boikemelo?,"The correct answer is **C: E boetse e tsejwa e le thuto e thehilweng ho morero**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that self-tutoring is *supportive* of learning, not a method of learning itself. It's akin to a tool (like a Microsoft Office paperclip) that assists *while* someone learns something new (like using a computer program or starting a project).  Project-based learning (thuto e thehilweng ho morero) is a specific *method* of learning, while self-tutoring is described as an aid *within* various learning methods.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

*   **A: Boikemello bo ka ba teng ka tshebediso ya khompiyutha:** The passage mentions using computer programs as an example of something someone might self-tutor.
*   **B: Ke thuso ho feta mokgwa wa ho ithuta:** This aligns with the passage's statement that self-tutoring isn't a learning method itself, but a support.
*   **D: Boikemelo bi sebedisetswa ho fana ka tshehetso qalong ya phihlelo ya ho ithuta:** The passage describes self-tutoring as asking questions, encouraging, and explaining things a learner might struggle with alone—providing support at the start.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke karolo efe ya MySpace e ka ruisang baithuti ba nang le bothata ba ho bala?","The correct answer is **C: Aterese e le nngwe ya webosaete**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ho etsang hore ho be bonolo ho le hopola le ho ba bonolo ho le thaepa bakeng sa baithuti ba ka bang le bothata ka ho sebedisa khiboto kapa mopeleto."" This directly refers to the ease of remembering and typing a single web address for students who struggle with reading or spelling.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hohlophiswa (Customization):** While customization is mentioned, it's not directly linked to helping students with reading difficulties.
*   **B: Di-blog (Blogs):** Blogs require reading and writing, which would be *difficult* for students with reading problems.
*   **D: Diprofaele tse dimilione tse 54 (Millions of profiles):** The number of profiles doesn't help students with reading difficulties.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e neng e se karolo ya karabo ya Krushchev merusung ya basebetsi?","The correct answer is **C: Eketsa ho fokotsa meputso**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the protests in Poland were *against* food shortages and *reduced wages*. Krushchev *conceded to demands relating to the economy* (D) and *allowed the election of a new prime minister* (A) and initially used force to suppress the uprising (B), but he did not increase wage reductions. In fact, the protests were *because* of wage reductions.

Therefore, increasing wage reductions would be the opposite of what Krushchev did in response to the protests."
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo e neng e se sesosa sa merusu Poland?,"The correct answer is **D: Ho kgethwa ha Wladyslaw Gomulka**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Krushchev *agreed* to the selection of Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new prime minister. This was a *result* of the protests, not a cause of them. The protests were about economic issues (food shortages and low wages) and a challenge to communist rule. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bokomonisi:** The protests were a direct challenge *against* communism.
*   **B: Kgaello ya dijo:** The passage explicitly states food shortages were a cause of the unrest.
*   **C: Ho fokotsa meputso:** The passage explicitly states reduced wages were a cause of the unrest.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e sa kang ya ama dikamano pakeng tsa USSR le USA?","The correct answer is **B: Maikutlo ka Jeremane**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the strained relationship between the USSR and USA was due to:

*   **Ho se dumellane ka tsamaiso** (disagreement about systems/ideologies)
*   **Mekgwa e fapaneng** (different customs/ways of life)
*   **Dikhohlano mabapi le ditsamaiso** (disagreements regarding governance)

While Germany was the defeated enemy in WWII which *led* to the alliance, the passage doesn't say differing *feelings* about Germany were a cause of the deterioration of the relationship. It was the underlying ideological differences that caused the tension."
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa hlaloseng ka nepo morero wa ho romela methapo ya kutlo ho pholletsa le mmele?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho fokotsa phallo ya madi** (To decrease blood flow).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the nervous system *maintains* proper blood flow (""tsweletsa pele phallo ya madi e tsamayang hantle"") and doesn't hinder it. Decreasing blood flow would be the opposite of its function.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

*   **B: Ho laola phallo ya madi** (To regulate blood flow) - The passage states the nervous system helps maintain proper blood flow, meaning it regulates it.
*   **C: Ho boloka botsitso ba homeostasis** (To maintain homeostasis) - This is the main function described in the first sentence.
*   **D: Ho qoba ditshokelo tse ka bang teng mmeleng** (To avoid shocks that may be in the body) - The passage says rapid signal transmission helps the body cope with *any* shock (""tshokelong le ha e fe e ka hlahellang"").



"
O ka fumana eng ho The Giza Plateau?,"The correct answer is **C: Dimakatso tse supileng kaofela**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Giza Plateau (""Giza Necropolis"") contains:

*   ""diphiramiti tse ngata (mme phiramiti e kgolo ke yona e di fetang kaofela)"" - many pyramids (including the Great Pyramid)
*   ""mabitla a mmalwa a manyane"" - several small tombs
*   ""ditempele tse mmalwa"" - several temples
*   ""Sefika se seholo kapa Sphinx e kgolo"" - the Great Sphinx

Therefore, the plateau has *all* of these wonders.



"
Morero oa Phiramiti e Kholo e ne e le ofe?,"The correct answer is **B: Ho hlompha Faro**.

The text states: ""Phiramiti e Kgolo e ke nngwe ya mehaho e mengata ya diphiramiti tse kgolo tseo ba neng ba di haha ho tlotla Faro ya shweleng."" and ""Phiramiti e kgolo e ile ya hahuwa ho tlotla Faro Khufu..."" This directly indicates the purpose was to honor the Pharaoh.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho ba e nngwe ya dimakatso tse supileng tsa lefatshe:** While it *is* one of the seven wonders, that's a result of its construction, not its original purpose.
*   **C: Ho sebetsa joalo ka letshwaao:** The text doesn't mention it being a symbol.
*   **D: Ho boloka mabitla a batho ba seng ba hlokahetse:** While there *are* tombs at Giza, the primary purpose of the Great Pyramid itself was for the Pharaoh's burial and honoring him, not simply storing bodies."
Ke mang ya ikarabellang bakeng sa tsebo ya rona ya setjheso se ileng sa senya tempele?,"The correct answer is **C: Strabo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""We know this today because the Greek historian Strabo reported the man's name.""  This directly links our knowledge of the arson and Herostratus to Strabo's historical record.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baefese** - While the Ephesians were involved (they were angered and tried to erase Herostratus's name), they didn't *provide* the knowledge we have today about the event.
*   **B: Alexandere e Moholo** - Alexander offered to pay for the rebuilding, but he wasn't the source of information about the initial destruction.
*   **D: Artemise** - Artemise was the deity the temple was dedicated to; she wasn't a source of historical information.



"
Ke polelo efe e nepahetseng mabapi le ho tsosolowa ha tempele ya Artemise?,"The correct answer is **B: E ile ya hahwa botjha ka mora puso ya Alexandere e Moholo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Hamorao kamora lefu la Alexander, tempele e ile ya tsosoloswa ka selemo sa 323 BCE."" This directly indicates the temple was rebuilt *after* Alexander the Great's death.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage says Alexander *offered* to pay, but the Ephesians refused.
*   **C:** The passage doesn't mention Herostratus being required to pay for the rebuilding.
*   **D:** While close, the passage states 323 BCE as the rebuilding year, not 320 BCE.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana seo, ke neng ha pele-pele ho ka etsahala hore mofuta o itseng o tsamaee ka maoto a mabedi?","The correct answer is **A: Dilemo tse dimilione tse supileng tse fetileng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...le hoja bo Sahelanthropus ba ka be ba ile ba tsamaya ka maoto a mabedi hoo e ka bang mathwasong a dilemong tse dimillione tse supileng tse fetileng."" This directly indicates the *earliest* possible instance of bipedalism (walking on two feet) was around 7 million years ago with Sahelanthropus.



"
Ke efe ho mefuta ee e neng e tsamaya ka maoto a mabedi kgafetsa?,"The correct answer is **B: Homo Erectus**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""people began walking upright millions of years ago with the emergence of *Homo Erectus* (meaning upright man)."" While other species showed *some* evidence of bipedalism (walking on two legs), Homo Erectus is specifically identified as the species that *began walking upright*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sahelanthropus:** The text says they *might* have walked on two legs ""occasionally,"" not frequently.
*   **C: Ho tsamaya ka maoto ka ho kgethehila (Walking upright):** This is a description of the action, not a species.
*   **D: Australopithecus:** While they developed the *ability* to walk upright, they didn't do so ""routinely"" like Homo Erectus. The passage states they were not routinely upright.



"
Sesole sa metsing sa Jeremane se ne se leka ho finyella eng nakong ya WWII?,"The correct answer is **B: Ho thibela Brithani ho amohela batho le thepa**.

Here's why:

The passage states the German U-boats ""were trying to prevent the convoy."" The convoy was the American effort to transport men and supplies *to* Britain.  Therefore, the German navy aimed to stop Britain from *receiving* those people and goods.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho thibela thepa e tswang Brithani** - The passage doesn't say they were trying to stop things leaving Britain, but things *arriving* in Britain.
*   **C: Ho tsamaisa thepa ho tshela Atlantic** - The German navy was trying to *stop* transport across the Atlantic, not facilitate it.
*   **D: Ho thibela Amerika ho amohela batho le thepa** - While the U-boats were targeting ships coming *from* America, the goal was to impact Britain, not America's ability to receive things."
"Ho latela boitsebiso bo fanweng serapengng sena, ke mang ya ileng a atleha ka ho fetisisa ntweng ya metsing nakong ya Letsholo la Lewatle la Atlantic Leboya?","The correct answer is **A: Mabrithani le Maamerika**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Allied convoys *succeeded* in getting men and supplies across the Atlantic to Britain."" While the German U-boats *tried* to prevent this, the Allies ultimately were successful. It doesn't explicitly say they won decisively, but it emphasizes their success in maintaining the supply lines. The passage also suggests that if the Allies *had* failed, Germany would have been able to defeat Britain, implying the Allies' success was crucial.



"
Ke eng e neng e le siyo ha ba-Assyria ba kenya tshebetsong tshebediso ya bapalami ba dipere?,"The correct answer is **A: Disale**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ho ne ho eso qaptjwe disale, kahoo sesole sa Assyria se ne se lwana se sa beha letho mekokotlong ya dipere."" This directly translates to: ""Saddles had not yet been invented, so the Assyrian army fought without anything on the backs of the horses.""  Therefore, the lack of saddles was a disadvantage when they started using cavalry."
Dintwa tse sebedisang bapalami ba dipere di lwanwa jwang?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka pere**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Sesole sa dipere ke mabotho a lwanang a kaletse dipere."" This directly translates to ""The cavalry is armies that fight *on horseback*."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ka maoto** - Cavalry fights *on* horses, not on foot.
*   **B: Ntle le dihlomo** - The text doesn't mention armor or lack thereof.
*   **D: Ka masole a fokolang** - The text doesn't specify the size of the cavalry forces.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke hokae moo o ke keng wa fumana moahi ya tlwaelehileng wa Babylona?","The correct answer is **D: Ho tlisa mahlabelo ka sehalalelong se ka hare**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states ""baprista feela ba neng ba kena ho sona [sehalalelong se ka hare]"".  This means a regular citizen of Babylon would *not* be found there.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:**  The passage says people *brought offerings to the temple grounds* (lebala la tempele) - this is where a regular citizen would be.
*   **B & C:** The passage mentions festivals happening at the temple, suggesting regular citizens participated in those.
*   **D:** Is the only statement that the citizen would not be found, because it is the sacred space for priests only.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e neng e etseditswe baprista ka ho kgetheha?,"The correct answer is **C: Mekete**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""baprista ba ne ba ikitlaelletsa ho tlisetsa medimo dintho tseo e di hlokang ka **meetlo le mekete**.""  This directly links priests to conducting ceremonies (mekete).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mekete** - While related to ceremonies, it's a more general term than what the passage specifies the priests did.
*   **B: Dibaka tse halalalang** - The passage describes the temple as a sacred space, but doesn't mention priests being responsible for *places* specifically.
*   **D: Di-Ziggurat** - The passage states ziggurats were *part of* the temples, not something priests specifically did or were responsible for.



"
Morena Tutankhamun o ile a tsebahala neng?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka mora ho sibollwa ha lebitla la hae**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Leha ho le jwalo, ho sibollwa ha lebitla la hae ka 1922 ho ile ha mo etsa motho ya tummeng."" (However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho latela tlatlapo ya lebitla la hae** - The passage doesn't say he was famous *because* of the treasures themselves, but because the tomb was discovered.
*   **B: Nakong ya puso ya hae** - The passage states he wasn't considered particularly important during his reign.
*   **D: Ka mora ho bolelwa lethathamong la marena a boholo-holo** - The passage says he wasn't initially highly regarded among the great pharaohs."
Ke eng e ileng ya etsa hore Morena Tutankhamun e be morena ya tsebahalang wa Egepeta?,"The correct answer is **C: Ho tlatlapuwa ha dikete tsa dintho tse entsweng ka lebitleng la hae** (The discovery of thousands of artifacts in his tomb).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Leha ho le jwalo, ho sibollwa ha lebitla la hae ka 1922 ho ile ha mo etsa motho ya tummeng."" (However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous.)  and goes on to describe the vast number of well-preserved treasures found within.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho sibollwa ha lebitla la hae le sa kgathatswang** (The discovery of his untouched tomb) - While true, it's the *contents* of the tomb that made him famous, not just the fact it was discovered.
* **B: Boemo ba hae lethathamong la marena a boholo-holo** (His position in the list of pharaohs) - The passage states he wasn't considered particularly important in ancient times.
* **D: Bohlokwa ba hae mehleng ya Egepeta ya boholo-holo** (His importance in ancient Egyptian times) - The passage directly contradicts this, saying he wasn't highly regarded during his lifetime.



"
Seroki sa Mogerike Homer se ile sa sitwa ho etsang?,"The correct answer is **D: Ho bua**.

Here's why:

The passage states Homer was a ""seroki se tummeng se foufetseng"" which translates to ""famous poet"". A poet's primary skill is **speaking** or, more accurately, writing (which is a form of speaking to a future audience) and creating works with language.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho utlwa (Hearing):** While important for a poet, it's not what defines their *work*.
*   **B: Ho bona (Seeing):**  Vision is not the defining characteristic of a poet.
*   **C: Ho tsamaya (Walking):**  Movement has no direct relation to the profession of a poet.



"
Ke Segerike sefe se tsebahalang ka ho hong ntle le dingolwang?,"The correct answer is **C: Di-Pythagorus**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states that Pythagoras was a famous **mathematician** (setsebi sa dipalo), known for his theorem about right triangles. This is a skill/knowledge outside of writing/literature.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Di-Sophocles** and **D: Di-Aristophanes** were playwrights (bangodi ba dipapadi) – their fame *is* based on writing.
*   **B: Di-Homer** was a poet - his fame *is* based on writing (Iliad and Odyssey).



"
Lelapa la Baheberu le ne le qeta boholo ba nako ya lona hokae?,"The correct answer is **A: Sebakeng se bulehileng** (In the open space).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Malapa a Baheberu a ne a phela nako e ngata a le kantle moo a hahlwang ke moya."" This directly translates to ""Hebrew families spent a lot of time outside, where they were exposed to the wind.""  This means they spent most of their time in the open space.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Seterateng** (On the street) - While there were shops facing the streets, the text doesn't say families *lived* on the street.
* **C: Ka jareteng** (In the yard) - The text doesn't specifically mention yards.
* **D: Ka tlung** (In the house) - The text explicitly states they spent *most* of their time *outside*, implying the house wasn't the primary living space.



"
Ke eng eo e neng e se ya bohlokwa hakaalo lelapeng la Baheberu?,"The correct answer is **C: Lehae la bona**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Sebakeng sa Botjhabela bo Hare moo ho futhumetseng, **ntlo e ne e se bohlokwa hakaalo**."" This directly translates to ""In the warm Middle East, **a house was not so important**."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Boemo ba bona ba lehodimo (Their weather condition):** While the passage mentions the climate being warm, it doesn't say the weather itself wasn't important.
*   **B: Mabenkele a bona (Their shops):** The passage mentions shops (mabenkele), but says they were small and open, not that they were unimportant.
*   **D: Ho pheha ha bona (Their cooking):** The passage mentions women cooking, but doesn't state that cooking was unimportant.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa hlaloswang e le phapang dipakeng tsa dinaha tsa Scandinavia?,"The correct answer is **B: Naha**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the lands (countries) of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were different. The passage discusses differences in people, customs (meetlo), and history, but it *highlights* the difference in *naha* (land/country) as a foundational difference.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Histori (History)** - The passage says the histories were different.
*   **C: Meetlo (Customs)** - The passage mentions different customs.
*   **D: Batho (People)** - The passage mentions different peoples.



"
Ke mang ya ileng a dula Greenland pele?,"The correct answer is **A: Merabe ya maeskimo** (The Eskimo tribes).

The passage explicitly states: ""Empa leha a ile a sibolla naha ena, merabe ya Maeskimo e ne e se e ntse e dula moo ka nako eo."" (But even though he discovered the land, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.)
"
Ke sehlopha sefe se ratang ho ja se sa dula ditulong?,"The correct answer is **C: Banna ba ruileng ba Roma**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""banna ba barui ba ne ba rata ho ba mmoho meketeng moo ba neng ba ka otla ka lehlakore ha ba ntse ba ja dijo tsa bona."" This means wealthy Roman men preferred to eat together in gatherings where they would recline while eating.
"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e neng e ke ke ya e-ba karolo ya mokete wa Roma ya Kgale?,"The correct answer is **D: Sejana sa turkey e hadikilweng** (A roasted turkey).

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states that foods like corn, tomatoes, apples, cocoa, and even potatoes were *not* available to the ancient Romans. Turkeys are native to the Americas and were not known in ancient Rome.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baeti ba futsanehileng ba ja ditulong** (Wealthy guests eating at tables) - The text mentions wealthy people eating while seated.
*   **B: Sejo se monate sa dikhofu** (A delicious meal of dormice) - Dormice (dikgofu) are specifically mentioned as a delicacy eaten at feasts.
*   **C: Banna ba ruileng ba robala nakong ya dijo tsa mantsiboya** (Wealthy men reclining during meals) - The text states that wealthy men preferred to eat together while reclining and eating on their sides.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e ke keng ya e-ba le tshusumetso e tshwarellang?","The correct answer is **B: Tlwaelo e nyane (small custom)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hangata ditso tse nyane di nyamela di sa siya bopaki bo hlokehang ba histori ebile ha di elwe hloko e le kahisano e nepahetseng.""  This means small customs often disappear without leaving much historical evidence and aren't considered full-fledged civilizations.  They *don't* have a lasting impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Setjhaba (nation):** The passage *defines* civilization as a type of nation, implying its importance and lasting nature.
*   **C: Motsemoholo (city-state):** The passage says city-states *build* nations and that the word ""civilization"" comes from words meaning city-state, indicating their foundational role.
*   **D: Kahisano (civilization):** The entire passage is *about* civilization and its enduring quality of transmitting knowledge and culture.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e etellang setjhaba pele?","The correct answer is **C: motsemoholo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Metsemeholo e nang le boipuso e haha ditjhaba."" (Autonomous cities build nations.) This directly indicates that autonomous cities/capitals precede and lead to the formation of a nation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kahisano (civilization)** - While civilization *is* a large group of people, the text says it's a *type of* nation, not what comes before it.
*   **B: Tlwaelo e le nngwe** - The passage doesn't mention customs as a precursor to nations.
*   **D: Ditso tse nyane** - The passage states small cultures often disappear and are *not* considered full civilizations.



"
Ke polelo efe ka The Drukgyal Dzong eo e seng nnete?,"The correct answer is **A: E hahilwe ho keteka tlholo ya mabotho a Tibetan-Mongol**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Drukgyal Dzong was built to *commemorate* Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel's **victory *against*** Tibetan-Mongol forces.  It wasn't built to celebrate *their* victory.

Let's look at why the other options are true:

* **B: E fumaneha Bhutan:** The text states it's in the Paro District of Bhutan.
* **C: Mollo o ile wa tjhesa mesaletsa e mengata ya qhobosheane:** The passage confirms a fire in 1951 left only ruins.
* **D: E entswe ke Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel:** The passage states Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the fortress in 1649.



"
Ke polelo efe e hlalosang ka nepo sephetho sa mollo ho Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **A: Ntho feela e setseng e ne e le setshwantsho sa Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal**.

The passage states: ""Ka 1951, ho ile ha qhoma mollo mme ha sala feela diemahale tse ding tse rapelwang tsa Drukgyal Dzong, tse kang setshwantsho sa Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal."" This directly supports answer A.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mabotho a Tibetan-Mongol a ile a hlola** - The passage says the Dzong was *built* to commemorate a victory *against* them.
* **C: Botumo ba khohedi ha bo a ka ba ameha** - The passage doesn't discuss the reputation of the fortress, only its physical state after the fire.
* **D: E bolokilwe ke Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel** - While he built it, the passage discusses its state *after* a fire, not its original construction.

Here's why:

*   **C is true:** The text states ""Qetellong ya ngwahakgolo wa bo18, Vietnam le yona e ile ya hapa Cambodia."" This means Vietnam invaded and occupied Cambodia during the late 18th century.
*   **D is true:** The text states ""Thailand e ile ya hapa Cambodia ka makgetlo a mmalwa ka ngwahakgolo wa bo18 mme ka 1772 ya ripitla Phnom Phen."" This means Thailand captured Phnom Phen in 1772.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ma-Vietnam a ile a senya Phnom Phen:** The text doesn't specifically mention Vietnam destroying Phnom Phen, only that they occupied it.
*   **B: Cambodia e ile ya hlasela Thailand ka-1772:** The text states Thailand captured Phnom Phen in 1772, implying Cambodia was *defending* against Thailand, not attacking it.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e hlalosang ka nepo tlhaselo ya Cambodia?,"The correct answer is **B: Mathai le Ma-Vietnam ba ile ba hlasela Cambodia ka-1772**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Thailand e ile ya hapa Cambodia ka makgetlo a mmalwa ka ngwahakgolo wa bo18 mme ka 1772 ya ripitla Phnom Phen. Qetellong ya ngwahakgolo wa bo18, Vietnam le yona e ile ya hapa Cambodia."" This directly confirms both Thailand *and* Vietnam attacked Cambodia, with Thailand's major action happening around 1772.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Only mentions Vietnam, ignoring Thailand's involvement.
* **C:** Only mentions Phnom Phen being captured, not the overall invasion.
* **D:** Only mentions Thailand, ignoring Vietnam's role.

Selekane sa Shimonoseki se thehile eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Bolaodi ba Japane hodima Taiwan**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""kamora ho hlolwa Ntweng ya Pele ya Sino-Majapane (1894-1895), mmuso wa Qing o saena Tumellano ya Shimonoseki, eo ho yona e nehelang puso ya Taiwan ho Japane...""  This directly translates to: ""after Japan's victory in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded governance of Taiwan to Japan...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho hlolwa ha Japane Ntweng ya Pele ya Sino-Japanese:** The treaty was a *result* of Japan's victory, not the treaty itself.
*   **B: Boemo ba Taiwan e le profinse tlasa leloko la borena la Qing:** This was the state *before* the treaty. The treaty *changed* that status.
*   **C: Bokgoni ba Taiwan ba ho kgutlisa taolo dibakeng tsa yona tse lebopong la lewatle:** The passage doesn't mention Taiwan regaining control; it speaks about Japan gaining control.



"
Boemo ba pH ba khemikhale bo lekanngwa jwang?,"The correct answer is **C: Palo ya di-ion tsa Haedrojene khemikaleng** (The number of hydrogen ions in the chemical).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Boemo ba pH bo bontshwa ke bongata ba diayone tsa Haedrojine (H e ho pH) khemikhaleng e entsweng teko."" (pH level is shown by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Khemikhale ke ya motheo kapa e nang le asiti hakae** (How basic or acidic the chemical is): This *describes* what pH tells you, but it doesn't *how* it's measured.
*   **B: Ke diprothone tse kae ka khemikhaleng** (How many protons are in the chemical): While related, pH specifically measures the *ions* of hydrogen, not just protons in any form.
*   **D: Ke di-electron tse kae ka hara dikhemikhale** (How many electrons are in the chemical): pH is not directly related to the number of electrons. It's about hydrogen ions (protons with a missing electron).



"
Ke eng e tlositsweng ho di-ion tsa Haedrojene?,"The correct answer is **D: Di-elektrone**.

The passage states: ""Diayone tsa Haedrojine ke di-proton tseo di-electron tsa tsona di tlositsweng ho tsona...""  This directly translates to ""Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been removed from them...""

Therefore, electrons are what are removed to *create* hydrogen ions.
"
Ke efe ho dipolelo tse latelang e sa hlaloseng ka nepo boikakaso ba ditau?,"The correct answer is **C: Tse tona le tse tshehadi kaofela di amana haufi-ufi**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""**Ditau tse tshehadi ka tlwaelo di amana haholo, e leng lelapa le leholo la bonnake le baradi.**""  This means the *female* (tse tshehadi) are closely related and form large family groups. It does *not* say the males (tse tona) are also closely related to both the females and each other in the same way.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

*   **A: Di itshwara ka mokgwa o tshwanang le sehlopha sa dintja** - The passage explicitly says they behave like packs of jackals or dogs.
*   **B: Karo-karolelano ya tse tona le tshehadi ha e tshwane** - The passage describes a hierarchy with 1-3 dominant males and many females, demonstrating an unequal ratio.
*   **D: Di ka bolaya le ho ba lephidisano** - The passage states they are dangerous to their prey, implying they kill and compete.



"
Ke efe ho dipolelo tse latelang e sa hlaloseng ka nepo boitshwaro ba ditau?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka bobedi tse tona le tse tshehadi di kotsi haholo ho diphofu**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that *the pack behaves like packs of jackals or dogs, and are a danger to the prey animals*. It also highlights that the females are closely related and form the core of the pack, with the males being more solitary.  It doesn't say that both males *and* females are equally dangerous to prey. The danger primarily comes from the pack's coordinated hunting behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Di lephedisano ka ho fetisisa** - The passage *begins* by stating they are the most predatory.
*   **B: Boitshoaro ba tsona bo tshwana le ba diphiri** - The passage directly compares their behavior to that of jackals.
*   **D: Boitshwaro ba tsona bo tshwana le ba dikatse tse ding tse kholo** - The passage says they behave like cats (though not the larger cat species), and are dangerous to prey.



"
Mebutlanyana ke phofu e tlwaelehileng ya sebatana sa mofuta ofe?,"The correct answer is **A: Dikatse tse nyane**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ho na le dikatse tse ngata tse nyane (ho kenyeletswa dikatse tsa malapeng tse sollang) tse jang diphoofotswana tse ngata haholo tse nyane jwalo ka dikokonyana, ditweba, mekgudutswane, le dinonyana.""  Mebutlanyana (a mouse) is a small animal eaten by small cats. Therefore, mebutlanyana is a typical prey of small cats."
Dikatse tse nyane di atisa ho tsoma efe ho tse latelang?,"The correct answer is **A: Ditweba**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""dikatse tse nyane (ho kenyeletswa dikatse tsa malapeng tse sollang) tse jang diphoofotswana tse ngata haholo tse nyane jwalo ka **dikokonyana, ditweba**, mekgudutswane, le dinonyana."" 

This directly says that small cats eat *ditweba* (spiders) among other small creatures. The other options (mebutlanyana, matsa, kgama) are mentioned as prey for *larger* cats, not the smaller ones.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo e seng karolo ya mokgwa wa ho tsoma wa ocelot?,"The correct answer is **C: Ho latela phofu ya tsona bosiu**.

Here's why:

The passage states ocelots hunt using:

*   **A: Ho ipata tikolohong ya tsona** (camouflaging with their surroundings) - they blend in and ambush.
*   **B: Ho latela monko wa phofu ya tsona** (following the scent of their prey) - they track animals by smell.
*   **D: Ho ja diphoofolo tse nyane feela** (eating only small animals) - The text mentions they eat rodents, rabbits, opossums, and birds.

The passage *doesn't* mention ocelots specifically tracking prey **at night** (bosiu). While they *have* good night vision, it doesn't say they actively track scents specifically during the night. It just states they can see well in the dark.

Therefore, option C is the one that isn't a described part of the ocelot's hunting method."
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa hlaloseng ocelot ka nepo? ,"The correct answer is **C: Kutlo ya tsona ya ho fofonela e a fokola** (Their sense of smell is weak).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that ocelots *use their sense of smell to track prey* (""Borasaense ba nahana hore di-ocelot di latela le ho fumana diphoofolo tse di jang (nyamatsane) ka monko..."").  Therefore, saying their sense of smell is weak is a contradiction of the text.

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Di kgona ho tsoma hantle bosiu** (They can hunt well at night) - The passage says they ""ka bona hantle lefifing ka pono ya bosiu"" (can see well in the dark with night vision).
*   **B: Di tsamaya ka kgutso** (They move silently) - The passage states they ""ho tsamaya ka ho ngotla mohwasa haholo"" (move very quietly).
*   **D: Di rata ho tsoma diphoofolo tse nyane** (They like to hunt small animals) - The entire first sentence describes them hunting small animals.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e ke keng ya nkwa e le matla a maholohadi a nkwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Ho qhoma (To jump)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the leopard's strength as being able to *carry* heavy prey (even five times its own weight), *climb*, and *roar*.  It does *not* mention jumping as a particular strength. While leopards *can* jump, the passage focuses on other displays of power.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho rora (To roar)** - The passage specifically states leopards can roar.
*   **B: Ho hlwa (To climb)** - The passage states leopards can climb.
*   **D: Ho hula (To carry)** - The passage describes leopards carrying heavy prey.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, phapang ke efe pakeng tsa dinkwe le ditau?","The correct answer is **B: Modumo wa ho puruma**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ho rora ha nkwe ha ho jwalo ka ha tau e hotseng ka botlalo, empa ho jwalo ka polelo ya mantswe a bitswang ka ho rora, a hoeletswa."" This directly compares the sounds made by panthers (nkwe) and lions (tau).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bokgoni ba ho sesa** - The passage states both can swim, but one does it better.
*   **C: Sebaka sa tsona sa ho tlola** - The passage only says the panther travels a long distance, not that its range differs from lions.
*   **D: Matla a ho hula** - The passage mentions a panther's powerful swipe, but doesn't compare it to the strength of a lion's swipe.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, Robert Hooke o ile a etsa eng pele ho ditsebi tse ding tsa baeloji?","The correct answer is **A: Sheba disele tse shweleng**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""E ne e le motho wa ho qala wa ho hlahloba disele tse shweleng."" (He was the first to observe dead cells). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sebedisa motjhine o hodisang ponahalo ya dintho ho sheba ntho e phelang:** While he *used* a microscope, the text focuses on what he observed – dead cells.
* **C: Ela hloko dikwere tse nyane:** He noticed the squares, but the key achievement was observing the cells *within* the cork.
* **D: Fumana dikarolo tse nyane tsa tshebetso ya ntho e phelang:** He didn't discover the *function* of cells, just their existence as building blocks.



"
Tshimoloho ya lentswe “sele” e bolelang?,"The correct answer is **C: Sebopeho se senyane**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sele e tswa lentsweng la Selatine e leng cella e bolelang phaposi e nyenyane."" This directly translates to ""The word 'cell' comes from the Latin word 'cella' meaning a small room/space/shape."" While ""phaposi e nyenyane"" can also be interpreted as a small compartment, ""sebopeho se senyane"" (small structure/shape) is a more encompassing and accurate translation of the original meaning in the context of biological cells.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Masekwere a manyane (Small squares):** While Hooke *saw* squares, that was a result of what he was observing (cork) and not the *origin of the word* 'cell'.
*   **B: Kamore e nyane (Small room):** This is a literal translation of 'cella', but doesn't quite capture the biological significance of the term.
*   **D: Dibolo tse nyane (Small balls):** The passage mentions cells *looking like* spheres, but this isn't the origin of the word.

"Ho latela seratswana, diphoofolo tse ngata di na le matla a ho etsa eng?","The correct answer is **A: Fofa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Diphoofolo tse ngata di kgona ho sisinyeha.""  ""Sisinyeha"" translates to ""to fly"" or ""to fofa"" in English. While the passage mentions animals can swim (sesa) and live on land, it specifically highlights the *ability to fly* as something many animals possess.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sutha** - The passage does not mention anything about animals being able to weave.
*   **C: Sesa** - While true (they swim in water), this isn't the specific ability highlighted as belonging to *many* animals.
*   **D: Tjheka** -  The passage does not mention anything about animals being able to dig.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, diphoofolo tse ding ha di na eng?","The correct answer is **C: Boko**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ke diphoofolo feela tse nang le boko (le hoja e se diphoofolo tsohle tse jwalo, jellyfish, ka mohlala, ha e na boko)."" This directly translates to: ""These are the only animals that have a spine (although not all such animals, jellyfish for example, do not have a spine)."" 

Therefore, the passage explicitly says some animals *do not* have a spine (boko).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Disele** - The text states animals *are* covered in many cells (""Diphhofolo di entswe ka disele tse ngata"").
*   **B: Bokgoni ba ho sila dijo** - The text states animals eat and digest food (""Di ja dintho mme di di sille ka hare"").
*   **D: Bokgoni ba ho ja** - The text states animals eat (""Di ja dintho"")."
Ke eng e thusang dimela tshebetsong ya tala?,"The correct answer is **D: Letsatsi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dimela di etsa dijo tsa tsona ho tswa letsatsing ka tshebetso ya photosynthesis."" This translates to ""Plants make their food from sunlight through the process of photosynthesis.""  Photosynthesis is the process plants use to create energy, and it *requires* sunlight.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Moriti (Water):** Water is *needed* for photosynthesis, but it doesn't directly *enable* the process. It's an ingredient, not the driving force.
*   **B: Diphoofolo (Animals):** Animals benefit from plants, but don't help plants with photosynthesis.
*   **C: Dijo (Food):** Plants *make* food, they don't need it to initiate photosynthesis.



"
Ke eng seo batho ba se hemang se hengwang ke dimela?,"The correct answer is **B: Oksijene**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Dimela di hlahisa oksijine eo batho ba e hemang..."" which translates to ""Plants produce oxygen that people breathe...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dijo (Food)** - While the passage says we *eat* plants, it doesn't say we breathe them.
*   **C: Metsi (Water)** - Water is important for life, but not what we breathe from plants.
*   **D: Khabondaeoksaede (Carbon dioxide)** - The passage states plants *take in* carbon dioxide, they don't give it to us to breathe.

"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho mehlala e latelang e ka sitisang tshebetso ya ho iphetola ha dintho?","The correct answer is **A: Sehlopha se senyenyane se hlolehang ho atleha sebakeng se setjha**

Here's why:

The passage explains that speciation happens when a population gets separated and needs to *adapt* to a new environment with different pressures. If a small group fails to thrive (i.e., doesn't adapt successfully) in the new environment, it won't be able to evolve into a new species.  It will likely die out, rather than diverge.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Karolo ya baahi ba le bang ba fallelang tikolohong e ntjha** - This implies *some* are adapting, which is a necessary step for speciation.
*   **C: Palo ya batho e fetolang boemo ba yona tikolohong e ntjha** - Population size can *influence* evolution, but doesn't necessarily stop it.
*   **D: Qetellong baahi ba le bang ba imena habedi** - This is just describing reproduction, which is part of the process, not a barrier to it.



"
Ke efe ho dipolelo tse latelang e sa hlaloseng ka nepo tshebetso ya ho iphetola ha mefuta ya dintho? ,"The correct answer is **A: E etsahala ha dintho di sa khone ho ikamahanya le maemo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on *geographic isolation* as the starting point for speciation.** A population becomes separated and then adapts to a *new* environment.  While inability to adapt *eventually* leads to extinction, speciation doesn't *begin* with inability to adapt. It begins with separation and subsequent *different* adaptations.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: Ke karolo ya bohlokwa ya tshebetso ya ho iphetola ha ntho** - The passage explicitly states: ""Ho iqolla ha mofuta ke setlamorao se ke keng sa qojwa le karolo ya bohlokwa ya tlholeho."" (Speciation is an unavoidable outcome and an important part of evolution.)
* **C: E bolela ho thehwa ha mofuta o motjha** - The passage defines speciation as ""ho qaleha ha mofuta o motjha wa sehlodilweng."" (The beginning of a new species.)
* **D: Ho etsahala ha yona ho ke ke ha qojwa** - The passage states ""Ho iqolla ha mofuta ke setlamorao se ke keng sa qojwa..."" (Speciation is an unavoidable outcome...)



"
Ke karolo efe ya tsamaiso ya ho potoloha ha madi e tlisang madi pelong?,"The correct answer is **D: Di-vein**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Madi a kgutlela pelong ka ditjhubu tse bitswang di-vein"" which translates to ""Blood returns to the heart through vessels called veins.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Methapo e tlosang madi pelong** (Vessels that take blood to the heart) - This is a bit vague and doesn't specifically identify the type of vessel.
* **B: Dikhapilari** (Capillaries) - These are the smallest blood vessels, where exchange happens, not the vessels *bringing* blood back to the heart.
* **C: Ditho** (Organs) - Organs are part of the circulatory system but don't specifically transport blood back to the heart.



"
Ke methapo efe e menyenyane ka ho fetisisa tsamaisong ya madi?,"The correct answer is **A: Dikhapilari**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ditjhubu tse nyane ka ho fetisisa di bitswa dikhapilari."" (The smallest blood vessels are called capillaries).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Methapo e tlosang madi pelong** - This refers to veins, not the smallest vessels.
*   **C: Di-vein** - Veins are vessels that *return* blood to the heart, but are not the smallest.
*   **D: Ditho** - This translates to ""organs"" and is not a type of blood vessel.



"
Bokgoni ba kokoanyana ba ho phutha mapheo a yona bo eketsa efe ho tse latelang?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho fumana dijo (Finding food)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ability to shed their tails helps grasshoppers ""successfully find food"". While it also helps with escaping predators (which relates to survival and thus could indirectly help with finding mates), the text *specifically* links tail shedding to finding food.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Ho pata dibaka (Hiding places):** While shedding a tail *can* distract a predator, the passage focuses on the advantage of having a larger area for smaller spaces, not specifically hiding.
*   **C: Ho fumana balekane (Finding mates):** The passage doesn't directly mention finding mates as a benefit of shedding tails.
*   **D: Ho fofa ka lebelo (Moving quickly):** The passage states they can escape predators *easily* due to their jumping ability, not that tail shedding directly increases speed.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa bolelwang serapeng e le ntho e anngweng ke bokgoni ba kokoanyana ba ho fofa?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolelele ba bophelo (Lifespan)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on how flight helps with:**
    * Escaping predators (ho balehela dira)
    * Finding food (ho fumana dijo)
    * Finding mates (ho fumana balekane)
    * Providing safer spaces to lay eggs (diphoofolo tse hlaselang)

* **The passage *doesn't* mention anything about how flight directly affects how *long* a dragonfly lives.** While being able to escape predators and find food *contributes* to a longer lifespan, the passage doesn't state that flight *is* the determining factor of lifespan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho ikatisa (Reproduction)** - The passage directly mentions flight helping with finding mates, which is essential for reproduction.
* **C: Ho bokella dijo (Foraging)** - The passage explicitly states flight helps dragonflies find food.
* **D: Katleho (Success)** - The passage implies flight contributes to overall success in survival and reproduction.



"
Ke ditshobotsi dife ho tse latelang tseo hangata di sa amaneng le di-dinosaur?,"The correct answer is **B: Masiba**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that people *don't* often think of birds as dinosaurs *because* they have feathers and can fly.  The other options (walking on hind legs, laying eggs, scaled legs) are all traits the passage highlights that birds *share* with dinosaurs.

Therefore, feathers are the characteristic most often *not* associated with dinosaurs.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo hangata e sa nkweng e le tshobotsi e arolelanwang ya dinonyana le di-dinosaur?,"The correct answer is **C: Bokgoni ba ho fofa (The ability to fly)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that many people *don't* think of birds as dinosaurs *because* they have feathers and can fly.  The other options are all characteristics birds share with dinosaurs, as stated in the passage:

*   **A: Ho behela mahe (Laying eggs)** – The passage states birds lay eggs, like dinosaurs.
*   **B: Ho sebedisa maoto a mabedi a ka morao ho tsamaya (Walking on two legs)** – The passage specifically mentions birds walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
*   **D: Maoto a nang le manala (Feet with scales)** – The passage says birds have scaled feet like dinosaurs.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke karolo efe ya semela sa-cycad e ka jewang ke Triceratops?","The correct answer is **A: Makgasi a hlabang**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mohlomong Triceratops e ne e hlohlora makgasi pele e ja kutu ka molomo wa yona o matla."" This translates to ""Perhaps Triceratops would nibble on the cones before eating the pith with its powerful mouth.""  This specifically indicates the cones (makgasi) were consumed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kutu** - The text says they ate *after* nibbling on the cones, not the pith itself.
*   **C: Motso** - The text mentions the ability to break down tough branches and roots, but doesn't state they ate the roots of cycads.
*   **D: Ditholwana** - The text brings up nuts in the context of modern animals like sloths and papakgaeye, but doesn't say Triceratops ate them."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e ka jewang ke Triceratops? ","The correct answer is **B: Semela se nang le makala a thata** (A plant with hard branches).

Here's why:

The passage states that Triceratops were able to crush tough branches and even trees. It also specifically mentions they likely ate cycads, which have tough, fibrous stalks. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sloth** - The passage mentions sloths *as an example of an animal that can eat tough things today*, but doesn't say Triceratops ate sloths.
*   **C: papakgaeye** - The passage says papakgaeye (a type of armadillo) can eat tough nuts, but doesn't say Triceratops ate papakgaeye.
*   **D: Semela se nang le tholwana e tjhefo** - While the passage mentions some animals eat tough nuts, it doesn’t state that Triceratops specifically ate them. The primary food source mentioned for Triceratops is plants with tough branches and stalks.

"Ho latela temanaseratswana, ke papadi efe ho e latelang eo e ka nnang yaba e tumme haholo dibakeng tse ka leboya-botjhabela ho Italy?","The correct answer is **A: Bolo ya maoto**.

Here's why:

The passage states that football (bolo ya maoto) is *among the most popular sports* in Italy overall. It *also* specifically mentions that Italians excel in international competitions and the Olympics in Northern areas. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that football would be popular in the Northeast as well, as it's nationally beloved and Italians from all regions participate in and follow the sport.

The other options are mentioned as popular, but not with the same emphasis or connection to the Northern regions specifically.
"
"Ho latela boitsebiso bo fanweng serapeng sena, ke papadi efe ho e latelang e ileng ya baka hore Italy e hape tlhodidisanong ya lefatshe?","The correct answer is **A: Bolo ya maoto**.

The passage specifically states that the Italian national football team won the FIFA World Cup in 2006. This directly answers the question."
Ke ka mora ketsahalo efe dikarolo tse ding tsa Luxembourg di ileng tsa fetoha tsa Belgian?,"The correct answer is **B: Phetohelo ya Belgian**.

The passage states: ""Dikarolo tse ding tsa Belgium ya kajeno e ne e le karolo ya Luxembourg nakong e fetileng empa ebile tsa Belgium kamora Phetoho ya Belgium dilemong tsa bo1830."" This directly links the change in territory to the Belgian Revolution.

Ke dikhilomithara tse kae tsa disekoere-khilomithara tsa sebaka sohle sa Turkey se Europe?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The text explicitly states: ""disekwere khilomithara tse 23,764 (9,174 sq mi) di Yuropa.""  The question asks for the square kilometer measurement of Turkey's area in Europe."
"Ho latela seratswana, Turkey e bolelele ba dikhilomithara tse kae?","The correct answer is **A: 1600**.

The passage states: ""Naha ya Turkey e bolelele bo fetang dikhilomithara tse 1,600 (1,000 mi)..."" which translates to ""Turkey's length exceeds 1,600 kilometers (1,000 mi)..."""
Puo ya Setadiana e sebedisetswang Toropong ya Vatican?,"The correct answer is **B: Puo ya ka mehla**.

The text states: ""Setaliana e boela e le puo ya kamehla e sebediswang ke bongata ba batho ba sebetsang seterekeng moo Selatine se sebediswang hangata meketeng ya bodumedi."" This directly translates to ""Italian is also the everyday language used by the majority of people working in the district where Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mekete ya bodumedi** - While Latin is used in religious ceremonies, the text specifies Italian is used *outside* of those ceremonies.
*   **C: Molao wa tsamaiso** - The text says Italian is used *in* law, but doesn't define it *as* the law itself.
*   **D: Puisano ya semmuso** - The text says Italian is used in official communication, but also states it's used in daily life. ""Puo ya ka mehla"" (everyday language) is the more encompassing and accurate description.



"
"Toropong ya Vatican, Setadiana ha se sebedisetswe eng?","The correct answer is **C: Mekete ya bodumedi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Selatine is ""frequently used in religious ceremonies"" while Italian is used in law and government discussions and as the everyday language. This means Setaliana ha se sebediswe hangata meketeng ya bodumedi. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Molao wa tsamaiso** - The passage explicitly says Italian *is* used for law.
*   **B: Puisano ya semmuso** - The passage states Italian *is* used for government discussions.
*   **D: Puo ya ka mehla** - The passage states Italian *is* the everyday language.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e ruang molemo ka ho kopanya molumo dik’homputha tse tswetseng pele?","The correct answer is **A: Mmino**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mmino hangata o rekotuwa ho sebediswa dik’homputha tse rarahaneng ho tsamaisa le ho kopantsha medumo."" (Music is often recorded using advanced computers to manipulate and combine sounds).  This directly links advanced computers to the process of mixing sound for music.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dipopae (Images/Graphics):** The passage says computers *create* images, but doesn't mention *mixing* them.
*   **C: Ditshwantsho (Pictures/Images):** Same reasoning as above.
*   **D: Etswa (Creation/Production):** This is too broad. The passage focuses on the specific application of *mixing* sound, not just general creation.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke sebakeng sefe seo boholo ba matlo a neng a na le matlwana a nang le metsi?","The correct answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in nearly every house, connected to a complex sewage system. While other places (Crete, Santorini, Egypt, Persia, China, Rome) had plumbing or latrines, Mohenjo-daro is the one described as having it in *almost every house*.



"
Ke dibakeng dife ho tse latelang moo tsamaiso ya dikgwerekgwere e tswetseng pele e ileng ya fumanwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""Ditoropokgolo tsa Harappa le Mohenjo-daro di ne di na le ntlwana ya metsi ho batlang e le ntlong e nngwe le e nngwe, tse hoketsweng sistiming e rarahaneng ya tsamaiso ya dikgwerekgwere."" (The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom in almost every house, connected to a complex sewage system.)

While the passage *also* mentions sewage systems in Santorini, Egypt, and China, it *specifically* highlights the advanced development in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro. Therefore, Harappa is the most direct and accurate answer to the question."
Ke efe ho tse latelang e etsang hore motho ya thellisang a fetohe?,"The correct answer is **A: Mokobeho o monyane botlaseng ba lehare la ho theledisa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hobane bokatlase ba mofeng bo kobehile hanyane, ha mofeng o sekamela lehlakoreng kapa ho le leng, mothati o thetsang leqhwa le wona o a kobeha.""  This directly explains that a slight curvature (mokobeho o monyane) at the bottom of the skate blade is what causes it to thin on the side it's leaning towards, enabling the turn.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Maqhubu a mabedi haufi le lehare la ho theledisa:** The passage only mentions two edges, not ""maqhubu"" (bumps).
*   **C: Maemo a kakaretso a sebapadi sa ho theledisa:** This is too general. The passage focuses on a *specific* characteristic – the curvature.
*   **D: Boleng ba leqhwa:** While ice quality is important for skating, the passage doesn't link it to *why* a skater can turn. It explains the mechanism of the blade itself.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e hlalosang ka nepo sekoti se lehareng la theledisa ya leqhweng?","The correct answer is **B: Se kobehile**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hobane bokatlase ba mofeng bo kobehile hanyane..."" (Because the edge of the skate is slightly curved...). This curvature is key to how the skate works, allowing the blade to flex with the skater's lean and create a thinner edge for better control. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Se mahlakoreng a mabedi** - The passage mentions two edges, but doesn't describe them as a defining characteristic of the *shape* of the blade.
* **C: Se kobehetse ka hare** - While the blade flexes *inward* when leaning, the passage primarily describes the initial *curve* of the blade.
* **D: Se sekamisitswe** - The passage describes the blade's flexibility, not rigidity.

"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke mokhwa ofe o dumellang diathomo ho tlosa matla a mangata a tswang leseding ?","The correct answer is **D: Kgothaletso ya ho ntsha radiation** (Stimulated emission of radiation).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Borasaense ba bitsa tshebetso ena """"stimulated emission of radiation"""" hobane di-atom di hlasimollwa ke kganya e matla, e leng se bakang ho ntshwa ha photon ya kganya..."" This directly links the process of removing energy to stimulated emission of radiation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mahlaseli** (Attacks) - While the atoms are 'stimulated', the passage doesn't describe it as an attack. It's a specific physical process.
* **B: Ho hlahiswa ha di-photons** (Production of photons) - This is a *result* of the process, not the process itself.  Photons are *emitted* because of stimulated emission.
* **C: Photon** (Photon) - A photon is a particle of light, it's what is *released*, not how the energy is removed from the atom.



"
Ke eng e etsang hore atom e ntshe photon?,"The correct answer is **B: Kgothatso e bakwang ke kganya e phatsimang** (Stimulation caused by strong light).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Di-atom di hlasimollwa ke kganya e matla, e leng se bakang ho ntshwa ha photon ya kganya, mme kganya ke mofuta wa radieishene."" This translates to ""Atoms are stimulated by strong light, which causes the emission of a photon of light, and light is a type of radiation.""  The passage then *names* this process ""stimulated emission of radiation.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho lokolla matla a feteletseng** (Releasing excess energy) - While related, the *cause* of the release isn't just excess energy, it's the stimulation *by* light.
*   **C: Maemo a matla a sa tsitsang** (Unstable energy states) -  The passage doesn't focus on the instability itself, but the trigger for returning to a stable state.
*   **D: Tshusumetso e mpe ho radiation** (Bad influence of radiation) - The light is *causing* the emission, not negatively influencing it.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e tla qetella e entse hore tleloubu e kgaotse ho sebetsa?","The correct answer is **C: Kgwele e ka hare ho tleloubu e tuka**.

Here's why:

The passage states the filament in the bulb is broken and the bulb doesn't work. It then explains the safety precautions needed *when replacing* the bulb. The broken filament is the reason the bulb is not working.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lebone ha le tingwe ka nepo:** The passage discusses turning the switch *off* or disconnecting the power *before* replacing the bulb, not a problem with how the switch is used during normal operation.
* **B: Ho se kenye tleloubu ka ho feletseng soketeng:** While the passage warns about not fully inserting the bulb during replacement (for safety reasons), it doesn't say this is *why* the bulb stopped working.
* **D: Phallo ya motlakase ho sokete e a fokotseha:** The passage doesn't mention anything about a decrease in electrical flow to the socket. It focuses on the danger of electricity if you touch the metal part of the bulb while power is still on.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e ka bang kotsi ho e tshwara ha u tjhentjha tleloubu?,"The correct answer is **C: Motheo wa tleloubu** (The base of the bulb).

Here's why:

The passage specifically warns about the metal part of the bulb base being dangerous if you touch it while the switch is on or the bulb is still connected to power. It states you can be shocked if you touch the inside of the socket or the bulb's base even slightly while it's still getting power.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kgwele (Glass):** While broken glass can be dangerous, the passage doesn't mention the glass itself as a shock hazard during replacement.
*   **B: Polaka ya lebone (Light switch):** The passage actually *instructs* you to turn the light switch off before changing the bulb.
*   **D: Mohala (Wire):** While wires can be dangerous, the passage's direct warning is about the base of the bulb.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho etsahalang ha kgubu e arotswe?","The correct answer is **B: Matla a lokollwa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states ""...ho arohanya kgubu hape mme ho tswe matla a mang."" This translates to ""...splitting the nucleus also releases energy.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Diprothone di a fumaneha** - The passage mentions protons, but doesn't say they are *found* when a nucleus splits. It states energy is needed to *combine* them.
*   **C: Diathomo di fetoha tse sa tsitsang** - The passage states *some* atoms *have* unstable nuclei, it doesn't say that splitting a nucleus *causes* them to become unstable.
*   **D: Dineutron di a lahleha** - The passage mentions neutrons, but doesn't say they are lost when a nucleus splits.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e bontshang mehala e melele ho khutlela Lefatsheng,"The correct answer is **B: Disathelaete**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sathalaete e sepakapakeng e fumana mohala ebe e o kgutlisetsa fatshe"" which translates to ""A satellite in space receives a signal and returns it to Earth."" This directly describes signals traveling back to Earth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ditheleskoupe (Telescopes):** Telescopes are used to *receive* light from space, not to send signals back.
*   **C: Mabone (Lights):** Lights don't relate to the concept of signals being returned.
*   **D: Dirokete (Rockets):** Rockets are used to *launch* things into space, but don't return signals.



"
Ke efe ho tsee e sebediswang ho beha ditheleskoupe sepakapakeng?,"The correct answer is **B: Dirokete**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ho hlokeha rokete e kgolohadi bo fetana maoto a 100 ka bophahamo ho e jarisa theleskoupe sepakapakeng."" (It takes a very large rocket more than 100 feet tall to position a telescope in space.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mahlasedi a kganyang** - While light is *received* by telescopes, it's not used to *place* them in space.
*   **C: Sepakapaka sa lefatshe** - The passage states the atmosphere *interferes* with telescopes, but isn't used to launch them.
*   **D: Disathelaete tse bohole ba maoto a fetang 100** - Satellites are *placed* in space, they don't place telescopes. And the height refers to the rocket needed, not the satellite itself.



"
Ke eng e lokelang ho hlokomelwa ka ketsahalo ya potoloho e le hore ho latelwe ho feta ha nako?,"The correct answer is **B: pheta-phetwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ketsahalo e potolohang ke ntho e etsahalang nako le nako kgafetsa."" (A repeating event is something that happens often). To measure the passage of time, you need something that *repeats* consistently. The frequency of that repetition is what allows us to define and track time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nako (Time)** - While the passage is about time, it asks what *about a repeating event* is important for measuring time.
*   **C: Ama (Loves/Affects)** - This is irrelevant to how we measure time.
*   **D: Bothata (Difficulty)** - The passage mentions time being difficult to understand, but that's not related to repeating events.

"Ho latela seratswana, ke karolo efe ya ketsahalo eo nako e sebediswang ho bapisa?","The correct answer is **B: pheta-phetwa**.

The passage states: ""O ka tshwaya ho tsamaya ha nako ka ho hlahloba ho pheta-phetwa ha ketsahalo e potolohang."" This directly links the measurement of time to the repetition of an event.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bolelele (Length)** - While the passage mentions length as how time is *taken* by events, it's not what we *use* to measure time.
*   **C: Phihlelo (Experience)** - The passage doesn't focus on how we *feel* time, but how we *measure* it.
*   **D: Ama (Love)** - The passage mentions that time ""loves everything we do"" but this is a metaphorical statement and not related to measuring time.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e nkwang e tloaelehile bakeng sa mojalefa teroneng?","The correct answer is **B: Ho tlohela univesithi ho kena sesoleng**.

Here's why:

The passage states that it was *customary* for a lord to go straight into the army after school. Charles deviated from this custom by going to university first. The other options are things Charles *did* but not what was traditionally expected. 

*   **A** is incorrect because a 2:2 degree is a result, not a custom.
*   **C** and **D** are incorrect because the passage says Charles studied both Humanity sciences, Archeology and History – this isn’t a general tradition."
"Ho latela dintlha tse fanweng serapeng, Charles e bile wa pele wa ho etsa eng?","The correct answer is **C: Ho fumana lengolo la degree**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Charles ebile setho sa pele sa Lelapa la Boreneng la Brithani sa ho fuwa lengolo la degree."" (Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to be awarded a degree.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kenela sesole pele a qeta sekolo** - The passage states the *tradition* was to go straight into the military, but Charles *didn't* follow that tradition.
*   **B: Ho thuta thuto ya ho epollwa ha dintho tsa kgale** - While he *did* study archaeology, he wasn't the first in his family to do so.
*   **D: Kena College ya Trinity** - He *did* attend Trinity College, but again, it wasn't a first for the family."
Dikepe tsa Trygvasson di ne di tswa naheng efe?,"The correct answer is **D: Norway**.

The text explicitly states: ""Olaf Trygvasson, e leng moNorway..."" (Olaf Trygvasson, who is from Norway...). Therefore, his ships would originate from Norway."
Ke nakong efe historing moo Jeremane e bileng le tshusumetso e matla ya setso Estonia?,"The correct answer is **A: Hoo e ka bang dilemo tse 200 tse fetileng**.

Here's why:

The passage states that in the northern part of Estonia, around 15th century (which is approximately 600 years ago), there was German cultural influence. While German influence *did* extend back further than that, the specific event described – German landlords attempting to translate the Bible into Estonian – happened around that timeframe. This is the most directly referenced historical period in the provided text.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate based on the information given.



"
Puo ya SeEstonia e ile ya susumetswa ke eng?,"The correct answer is **C: Baitlami ba Majeremane**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Banna ba bang ba baitlami ba Majeremane ba ne ba batla ho tlisa Modimo haufi le matswallwa a moo, kahoo ba qapa puo ya Seestonia ya lentswe ka lentswe."" This directly states that German missionaries were the impetus for creating a written Estonian language.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tlhaku ya Õ/õ** - While the letter Õ/õ is *part* of the Estonian language, it's a result of the influence, not the cause of it.
*   **B: Alfabeta ya Sejeremane** - The alphabet was *based* on German, but the desire to create the language came from the missionaries.
*   **D: Modimo** - While the missionaries wanted to bring God closer to the people, it was *their actions* (creating the language) that influenced Estonian, not God directly.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, palo ya batho ba buang se-Hindi e feto-fetoha ho latela ntlha efe?","The correct answer is **A: Haeba dipuo tse tshwanang haholo le Sehindi di ntse di balwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Palo ya matswallwa a buang puo ena e fapana ho itshetlehile ka hore na ho balwa le batho ba buang mefuta ya puo e haufiufi le puo eo.""  This directly means the number changes depending on whether you *include* speakers of closely related languages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Haeba dibui tsa Urdu di ntse di balwa:** While Hindi and Urdu are similar, the passage states they're *often mutually understandable in daily conversation*, but the fluctuating number isn't specifically tied to counting Urdu speakers.
* **C: Haeba ho balwa batho ba kgonang ho utlwisisa puo:**  The passage mentions 800 million *understand* Hindi, but the fluctuating speaker number is about who *speaks* it.
* **D: Haeba ho balwa batho ba tsebang ho bala puo:** The passage doesn't mention literacy as a factor in the changing numbers.



"
Ke polelo efe ho tse latelang eo e leng nnete ka dipuo tsa Se-Hindi le Se-Urdu?,"The correct answer is **B: Di fapane ka mongolo**.

Here's why:

The text states: *""Mantswe a puo ya Sehindi le a Seurdu aa tshwana empa a ngolwa ka tsela e sa tshwaneng""* which translates to *""The words of Hindi and Urdu are similar but written differently.""*

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hangata ho na le ho kgaoha dipakeng tsa dibui tsa dipuo ka bobedi** - The text implies they *understand* each other, not that there's confusion.
*   **C: Di tshwana ka mantswe le mongolo** - The text specifically says they are written differently.
*   **D: Di fapane ka mantswe** - The text says the words are *similar*.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo e seng nnete e nepahetseng ka alfabeta ya Hangeul?,"The correct answer is **B: Lebitso la mantlha la alfabeta e ne e le Hunan Jeongeum**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the original name was **Hunmin Jeongeum**, not Hunan Jeongeum.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: E qapilwe qalong ya puso ya Morena Sejong** - The passage states it was created in 1444, during his reign (1418-1450).
*   **C: E qapilwe ke morena Dynasty wa bone wa Puso ya Joseon** -  The passage confirms Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon dynasty.
*   **D: E qapilwe ka boomo** - The passage states it was *designed* with a purpose (""medumo e nepahetseng bakeng sa thupelo ya setjhaba"") which implies deliberate creation."
Alfabeta ya Hunmin Jeongeum e ile ya qetella e fetoletswe ho eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

The text states: ""Sethathong o ile a reha alafabeta ya Hangeul hore ebe Hunmin Jeongeum..."" which translates to ""He then gave the alphabet of Hangeul the name Hunmin Jeongeum..."". This means Hunmin Jeongeum is the *original name* of what we now know as Hangeul.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke dipuo dife tse susumeditsweng ke Sanskrit?","The correct answer is **D: Dipuo tsa MaIndia**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Sesanskrit ke mohlodi wa mantswe a dipuo tse ngata tsa kajeno tsa Seindia, jwalokaha Selatine e le mohlodi wa mantswe a dipuo tsa Seyuropa tse kang Sefora le Sepanishe."" This translates to: ""Sanskrit is the source of many words in modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the source of many words in European languages such as French and Spanish.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dipuo tsa Selatine** - The passage compares Sanskrit *to* Latin, but doesn't say Sanskrit influenced Latin.
*   **B: Dipuo tsa Yuropa** - While the passage uses European languages as an analogy, it states Sanskrit influences Indian languages.
*   **C: Dipuo tsa kgale** - Sanskrit *is* an ancient language, but the question asks what languages it influenced.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, tshebediso ya Sanskrit e ile ya fokotseha ka lebaka la eng?","The correct answer is **D: Boemo bo phahameng**.

The passage states: ""Kamora ho bokellwa ha ditokomane tsa Upanishads, Sesanskrit se ile sa nyamela ka lebaka la maemo a sona papisong le dipuo tse ding."" This translates to ""After the collection of the Upanishads documents, Sanskrit disappeared due to its status in relation to other languages.""  The ""status"" here implies its high, formal, and perhaps inaccessible nature compared to more commonly spoken languages, leading to its decline.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho rarahana (Complexity):** While the passage mentions Sanskrit is complex, it doesn't state that this *caused* its decline.
* **B: Ho falla ha Aryan (Aryan migration):** The passage mentions Aryan migration as a theory of its origin, not a reason for its decline.
* **C: Dipuo tsa Selatine (Latin languages):**  Latin languages are mentioned for comparison, not as a cause of Sanskrit's decline.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e leng polelo e nepahetseng mabapi le matla a kgohedi a ho Io?","The correct answer is **B: Matla a kgohedi a Io a hula ho feta, ke ka lebaka leo o ka fokolang.**

Here's why:

The passage states that your weight would *decrease* on Io compared to Earth (90kg to 16kg). This means Io's gravitational pull is *weaker* than Earth's.  If the gravitational pull was stronger, your weight would *increase*. The passage explains this decrease is why you would feel lighter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** Incorrect, the passage states Io's gravity is weaker.
*   **C:** Incorrect, the passage says you would feel *lighter* because of the weaker gravity, not heavier and able to jump higher.
*   **D:** Incorrect, the passage states Earth's gravity is stronger.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho dipolelo tse latelang e hlalosang ka nepo lera le ka ntle la Kwgedi?","The correct answer is **A: Lehlakore le haufi le na le bokahodimodimo bo teteaneng**.

Here's why:

*   The text states the crust (bokantle) is 70km thick on the near side and 100km thick on the far side. This means the near side crust is *thinner* (""teteneaneng"" translates to thin).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Lekhapetla le lesesaane tlasa dibaka tse phahameng:** The text doesn't mention a softer crust under highlands.
*   **C: Ho ka nna ha e-ba le maria a fokolang ka lehlakoreng le hole:** The text indicates *more* maria on the near side because the crust is thicker.
*   **D: Ho ka nna ha e-ba le maria a fokolang tlasa dibaka tse phahameng:** The text does not provide this information.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, bokahodimo ba kgwedi bo botenya kae ka ho fetisisa?","The correct answer is **A: Ka lehlakoreng le haufi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bokantle bo botenya bo ka bang 70 km ka lehlakoreng le ka haufi mme le botenya ba 100 km lehlakoreng le hole.""  This directly tells us the crust (bokantle) is thinnest on the near side (lehlakoreng le haufi).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Moo ho nang le maria a mangata:** While maria are mentioned, the passage doesn't link their presence to the *thinnest* crust. It suggests the crust is thicker *under* highlands.
*   **C: Tlasa dibaka tse phahameng:** The passage states the opposite – the crust is *thicker* under highlands.
*   **D: Tlasa maria:** Same as B, the text doesn't indicate maria have the thinnest crust.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e lumelwang ke batho ba itseng?","The correct answer is **C: Bophelo bo teng mafatsheng a mang**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ba bang ba ipotsa hore ho na le eng kantle, ba bang ba dumela hore batho ba dipolanete tse ding kapa mefuta e meng ya dintho tse phelang di dula polanenteng e nngwe.""  This directly translates to ""some wonder what's out there, others believe that people from other planets or other forms of life live on another planet.""  This indicates a belief in life existing elsewhere.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Batho ba ile dinaleding tse ding** - The passage discusses the possibility of life *on other planets*, not people traveling to other stars.
* **B: Batho ha ba khone ho hlahloba mafatshe a mang** - The passage doesn't say anything about the *ability* to explore, only about speculation about what might be out there.
* **D: Ho na le dikhilomithara tse ka tlaase ho dibilione pakeng tsa dinaledi** - While the passage mentions vast distances (trillions of miles), it doesn't specifically state *kilometers*. It's information provided to highlight the challenges of interstellar travel, not a belief held by people.



"
Ke eng e ntseng e fokola ha o tloha setsing sa Letsatsi?,"The correct answer is **C: Kgase**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ha o kenella hare ho tloha kgubung ya Letsatsi, **kgase e ba tshesane le ho feta.**"" This directly translates to ""As you move inward from the surface of the Sun, **gas becomes denser and denser**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Plasma:** While the Sun *contains* plasma, the passage doesn't say plasma is what gets more dense. It's the gas *turning into* plasma.
*   **B: Mollo:** The Sun isn't literally ""burning"" with fire as we understand it on Earth. It's a nuclear fusion reaction.
*   **D: Bokahodimo ba kgwedi:** (Lunar surface) This is completely irrelevant to the composition of the Sun.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke karolo efe ya letsatsi e bonahalang ho tswa Lefatsheng?","The correct answer is **C: photosphere**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Karolo e ka hodimo eo re e bonang ha re sheba Letsatsi e bitswa photosphere, e bolelang “bolo ya kganya”."" (The upper part that we see when we look at the Sun is called the photosphere, meaning ""sphere of light"").



"
Ke dintlha dife ho tse latelang tse ileng tsa thusa ho tiisa kgopolo ya Copernicus?,"The correct answer is **A: Mekgahlelo ya Venus**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Dibopeho tsa Venus di ne di tshehetsa thuto ya Copernicus hore dipolanete di potoloha Letsatsi."" This directly links the phases of Venus (mekgahlelo ya Venus) to supporting Copernicus's theory.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ho tsamaya ha Venus** - While Venus does move, the text doesn't say its motion *specifically* supported Copernicus.
*   **C: Ho tshwana ha Letsatsi le Venus** - The text doesn't mention a comparison between the Sun and Venus.
*   **D: Ho tshwana ha Letsatsi le Kgwedi** - The text uses the *similarity of the phases of Venus and the Moon* as an illustration, but doesn’t state similarity of the Sun and the Moon.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e ileng ya hlokomelwa ke Galileo Galilei ka-1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Mekgahlelo ya Venus**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Galileo Galilei se ile sa sebedisa theleskoupo e ileng ya se lemosa hore Venus e na le dibopeho jwalo ka kgwedi."" (Galileo used a telescope which revealed that Venus has phases like the moon). These phases are referred to as ""mekgahlelo"" (phases) in Setswana.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lehlakore la kgwedi le shebaneng le Letsatsi** - While the passage explains *why* Venus has phases (similar to the moon being lit by the sun), it doesn't say Galileo observed the side of the moon.
*   **C: Lefatshe le potoloha Letsatsi** - Galileo's observation *supported* the idea that planets orbit the Sun (Copernicus's theory), but he didn't directly observe that fact in 1610.
*   **D: Ho tsamaya ha Venus** - The passage mentions a change in Venus observed later by Horrocks, not Galileo.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, Noka ya Amazon e bokella metsi hokae?","The correct answer is **A: Dinokeng tse nyane**.

The passage states: ""Nōka ya Amazon e kgolo dikhilomithara tse 6,387 (di mile tse 3,980). E bokella metsi ho tswa dinokeng tse nyenyane tse dikete-kete."" This directly answers the question.



"
Ke thoriso efe e sa amaneng le Noka ya Amazon?,"The correct answer is **C: Ke noka e telele ka ho fetisisa**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Noka ya Amazon ke ya bobedi e telele ka ho fetisisa..."" (The Amazon River is the *second* longest river.)

Let's look at why the other options are correct and supported by the text:

*   **A: Ke noka ya bobedi e telele ka ho fetisisa** - This is directly stated in the passage.
*   **B: Ke noka e kgolohadi** - The passage says it's the largest river in the world by volume (""e kgolo ka ho fetisisa Lefatsheng"").
*   **D: Ke noka e sephara** - The passage states it's the widest river (""e bulehileng ka ho fetisisa Lefatsheng"").



"
Ke mosebetsi ofe o boletsweng serapeng o sebedisang palo e fokolang ya batho ba Venezuela?,"The correct answer is **C: Oli**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""empa ke feela pheresente e le nngwe e sebetsang indastering ya oli"" which translates to ""but only one percent works in the oil industry"". This clearly indicates that the oil industry employs the smallest percentage of the Venezuelan workforce mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Temong** - The passage states ""a le mong ho ba bahlano o sebetsa temong"" (one in five works in agriculture), which is 20% - significantly more than 1%.
*   **B: Indasteri** - While not specifically defined, the passage states that oil is the main industry in Venezuela, and 1% works in the oil industry.
*   **D: Tshebeletso** - The passage says ""Batho ba babedi ho ba bararo ba Venezuela ba sebetsang ba lekaleng le fanang ka ditshebeletso"" (two out of three Venezuelans work in the service sector), meaning about 66.7% - the largest portion."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang tse sebedisang palo e kgolo ya batho ba Venezuela?","The correct answer is **A: Tshebeletso**.

The passage states: ""Batho ba babedi ho ba bararo ba Venezuela ba sebetsang ba lekaleng le fanang ka ditshebeletso..."" (Two out of three working Venezuelans are in the service sector). This indicates that the service sector employs the largest number of people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Temong:** The passage says only ""a le mong ho ba bahlano"" (one in five) work in agriculture.
*   **C: Indasteri:** While industry is important, it doesn't employ the most people.
*   **D: Oli:** Only 1% work in the oil industry."
"Ho latela seratswana, ho kopana ha dinutlelie ho dumella dinaledi ho etsa eng?","The correct answer is **C: Fana ka kganya le motjheso**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dinaledi di hlahisa kganya le otjheso ka lebaka la eneji e entsweng ha di-atom tsa haedrojine di kopana..."" (Stars produce light and heat because of the energy made when hydrogen atoms combine...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Theha dikarolo tse boima (Create heavier elements)** - While the passage *does* mention heavier elements being formed, it says this is the *result* of the fusion, not what it allows stars to *do*.
*   **B: Haha mohlodi wa matla a motlakase (Create an electrical power source)** - The passage doesn't mention electrical power.
*   **D: Etsa di-athom tsa haedrojene (Make hydrogen atoms)** - The passage states hydrogen atoms *combine*, not that they are made.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e ka hlahiswang ke mohlodi wa matla a motlakase?,"The correct answer is **B: Dinaledi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that stars (Dinaledi) *produce* energy from the fusion of hydrogen atoms. The question asks what can *produce* electrical power, and the passage connects stars directly to energy production.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Haedrojene (Hydrogen)** - Hydrogen is the *fuel* for stars, not the producer of electricity directly.
*   **C: Di-Athom (Atoms)** - Atoms are the building blocks of matter; they don't produce electricity on their own.
*   **D: Matla (Power)** - Power is the *result* of energy production, not a source itself.



"
Moetso wa dik’hemik’hale wa metsi ke ofe?,"The correct answer is **D: Diathomo tse pedi tsa haedrojene le athomo e le nngwe ya oksijene**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Metsi ke mohlala o mong. Motswako wa metsi o entswe ka diathomo tse pedi tsa haedrojene le athomo e le nngwe ya oksijene."" (Water is an example. The composition of water is made up of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen).



"
"Ha metsi a fetoha, ke eng e tla lula e tshwana?","The correct answer is **A: Sebopeho sa dimolek’hule** (The shape of the molecules).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Le hoja boema ba yona ba mmele bo ka fetoha, boemo ba dik’hemik’hale bo sa ntse bo tshwana."" (Even though its physical state can change, its chemical state remains the same.)  It then uses water as an example, explaining that water molecules (H₂O) maintain the *same* shape whether they are gas, liquid, or solid.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Botenya** (Thickness) - This is not mentioned in the passage, and isn't a characteristic that remains constant.
* **C: Boemo ba mmele** (Physical state) - The passage *specifically* says this *changes* (gas, liquid, solid).
* **D: Naetrojene e metsi** (Nitrogen in water) - The passage discusses hydrogen and oxygen in water, not nitrogen.  Also, the composition doesn't change, the *arrangement* (shape) of those components does not.

"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang eo e neng e se taba bakeng sa dinaha tse leshome le metso e meraro ha di leka ho beha melao e itseng?","The correct answer is **C: Ditokiso tse hlokang tumello e le nngwe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Molao ona wa Motheo o ne o batla hore dinaha tsohle di dumellane di le ntsweleng pele melao yohle e ka fetolwa."" This means any change to the laws required *unanimous* agreement from all thirteen states.  This made it incredibly difficult to amend or improve the Articles of Confederation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tlhokomelo e boima ho tswa ho balaodi ba mmuso:** The passage does mention reliance on state governors for enforcement, but it doesn't frame it as a *problem* of difficulty getting their attention. It's simply a description of how the system worked.
*   **B: Ho hloka matla ka hare ho Congress:** While the passage describes Congress's weakness (inability to tax, lack of a national cabinet/courts), the question asks about difficulties *passing laws*. The lack of internal Congressional power is a consequence, not the primary obstacle to making laws.
*   **D: Phethahatso ya naha e seng teng:**  The passage mentions states occasionally not even sending representatives, but this wasn’t the primary issue of *enacting* laws, but of having a quorum for business.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke polelo efe e bontshang ka nepo boemo ba mmuso o bohareng nakong ya Ntwa ya Phetohelo?","The correct answer is **C: Baemedi ba naha ba ne ba sa be teng**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""dinaha tsena di ne di kgesa mmuso o bohareng hoo hangata baemedi ba tsona ba neng ba sa be teng."" This directly describes a key weakness of the central government under the Articles of Confederation - a lack of consistent attendance and participation from state representatives.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Makgetho a ne a qobellwa ke Congress le balaodi ba naha** - The passage states Congress *couldn't* effectively enforce tax collection.
*   **B: Ditokiso ho Dingollwa di ne di itshetlehile ka matla a Congress** - The passage says amendments required unanimous agreement from *all* states, not just the power of Congress.
*   **D: Mmuso o moholo o ne o e-na le dikarolo tse pedi tsa sehlooho** - While Congress was a part of the government, the passage doesn't describe a two-headed executive branch.



"
Mantswe a ka morao ho Phatlalatso ya Boikemelo a ngotswe jwang?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka mongolo o moholo**.

The text explicitly states the writing is ""ka mongolo o moholo"". The other options are not mentioned in the passage."
Singapore e tumme ka efe ho tse latelang?,"The correct answer is **A: Botala ba ditoropong** (Gardens in the city).

Here's why:

The passage directly states that the Singapore Botanic Gardens helped transform Singapore into a ""Garden City."" This means the city is known for its greenery and gardens.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ho tsamaya ka maoto** (Walking) - While Singapore is walkable, the passage doesn't focus on this.
*   **C: Dipapadi tse makatsang** (Amazing waterfalls) - The passage doesn't mention waterfalls.
*   **D: Bonono ba tshebetso** (Performing arts) - The passage doesn't mention performing arts.



"
Vanda Miss Joaquim ke eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Palesa**.

The text states: ""Ka 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, e leng orchid ya motswako, e ile ya kgethwa e le **palesa ya naha** e ratwang ke setjhaba."" (In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, a hybrid orchid, was chosen as the **national flower** loved by the nation.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sehlekehleke** (Garden) - While it grows in a garden, it *is* the flower itself, not the garden.
*   **C: Botanical garden** - The Singapore Botanic Gardens is where it is featured, but it isn't the flower itself.
*   **D: Seemahale sa naha** (National emblem) - While a national flower can *be* part of a national emblem, the text specifically calls it a ""palesa ya naha"" (national flower).



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke boleng bofe ba diphiramide tsa Giza bo neng bo ke ke ba hlolla ho Baegepeta ba New Kingdom?","The correct answer is **A: Dilemo tsa tsona**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the pyramids of Giza *had been there for over a thousand years* when the New Kingdom Egyptians saw them. It also says the New Kingdom Egyptians were *astonished* by the works of their ancestors.  This astonishment came from the fact that the pyramids had stood for such a long time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tshebediso ya majwe (Use of stone):** While the passage mentions stone was used, it doesn't say this was the astonishing part.
*   **C: Boholo ba tsona (Their size):** The passage states they weren't surpassed in size, but doesn't say the New Kingdom Egyptians were amazed *because* of their size.
*   **D: Kaho ya tsona (Their construction):** While impressive, the passage focuses on the *time* they'd existed as the source of wonder.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, diphoofolo tse jang ditlama di tloha kae ho lelekisa pula?","The correct answer is **C: Mabala a ka borwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Selemo le selemo kgweding ya Mphalane diphoofolo tse jang jwang tse ka bang dimilione tse 1.5 di theohela **mabalane ka borwa**..."" (Every year in March, about 1.5 million herbivores migrate from the **southern plains**...).

Therefore, the animals migrate *from* the southern plains in response to the rains."
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke sebaka sefe seo diphoofolo tse jang dimela di tlohang ho sona nako e nngwe ka bo Mmesa?","The correct answer is **B: Mabala a ka borwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Selemo le selemo kgweding ya Mphalane diphoofolo tse jang jwang tse ka bang dimilione tse 1.5 di theohela **mabalane ka borwa**... Ebe di leba ka leboya hape di se di hlaha ka bophirimela, di boetse di tshela Noka ya Mara, kamora sehla sa dipula ho elella kgweding ya Mmesa.""

This clearly indicates the animals *come from* the southern plains around March/April (leading into Mmesa).  The other options are places they travel *to* or areas within the migration route.



"
Operation ya Sealion e ne e le tlhaselo ya naha efe?,"The correct answer is **A: Jeremane**.

The text states ""Majeremane a ile a reha tlhaselo eo “Operation Sealion”."" which translates to ""The Germans named the attack 'Operation Sealion'"". Therefore, Operation Sealion was a German attack.



"
Jeremane e ile ya bitsa tlhaselo ya Brithani jwang?,"The correct answer is **B: Operation Sealion**.

The passage specifically states: ""Majeremane a ile a reha tlhaselo eo “Operation Sealion”."" (The Germans named the attack “Operation Sealion”).



"
Ke eng e sa bolelwang e le mohato o hlokahalang morerong wa Italy wa ho hapa dinaha tsa Afrika?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho tlosa dikepe Egepeta**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Hore e atleha, e ne e tla lokela ho fedisa dikampo tsa Mabrithani le dikepe tse Egepeta."" This means eliminating the Egyptian navy was a necessary step in Italy's plan to conquer Africa.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ho haha dikepe tse eketsehileng:** The text says Italy's navy was weak, but focuses on the need to *defeat* existing naval forces (British & Egyptian) not build more ships.
*   **C: Ho theha sebaka sa ho qala sesole:** While a staging area (airbase) is mentioned, it's a consequence of controlling territory, not a primary step in the plan.
*   **D: Ho senya ditsi tsa Brithani:** The text mentions eliminating British *camps* (not ships), but focuses more on the naval aspect of the plan."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e neng e nkwa e le sepheo se ka sehloohong sa ntwa ya Italy?","The correct answer is **A: Ho hapa dinaha tsa Afrika**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Italy's involvement was ""primarily in the countries of Africa."" It goes on to detail how capturing Africa was dependent on eliminating British bases and Egyptian ships, and how crucial air bases were for that effort.  While building a navy and eliminating Egyptian ships were *steps* towards the goal, the ultimate goal was controlling Africa.
"
Ke mang ya thehileng dikamano tsa botswalle le bahlasedi?,"The correct answer is **B: Sefora sa Vichy**.

The text specifically states that the Vichy French were the people who formed an agreement with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with them. This collaboration is essentially forming a friendly relationship with the enemy.
"
Balekane e ne e le bo mang ba neng ba ameha tshebetsong ya Operation Dragoon?,"The correct answer is **A: Maamerika le Mafora a Lokolohileng**.

The text specifically states: ""Ka dibeke tse pedi feela, mabotho a Maamerika le Mafora a Lokolohileng a ne a lokolotse karolo e ka borwa ya Fora mme jwale a habile Jeremane."" This directly identifies them as the participants in Operation Dragoon.



"
Ke kgatelo-pele ya theknoloji efe e entseng hore dikepe tse tsamayang ka tlasa metsi di qale ho tsamaya tlasa metsi?,"The correct answer is **D: Navikeitara ya ditemoso lewatleng**.

Here's why:

The passage states that submarines initially travelled on the surface but *had* to stay underwater because of improvements in detection technology (specifically, sonar). The improved sonar meant submarines could be seen more easily on the surface, forcing them to remain submerged.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Di-U-Boats** - These were German submarines, not a technological advancement.
*   **B: Sebaka sa ho thunya** - The ability to shoot torpedoes existed regardless of whether they were on the surface or underwater.
*   **C: Ho tsamaya ha dikepe** - This is too general. The question asks about the technology that *caused* them to go underwater.



"
"Nakong ya tshebediso ya tsona ya pele, disabomarine di ne di e-na le sebaka se fokolang haholo sebakeng sefe?","The correct answer is **C: Ho thunya**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Qalong ya ntwa, di ne di tsamaya haholoholo ka hodima lewatle, empa ha navikeitara ya ditemoso lewatleng e ntse e ntjhafatswa, mme e nepa le ho feta, di sabomarine di ile tsa tlameha ho dula tlasa metsi hore di se ke tsa bonwa.  ... di ka thunya sebakeng se haufi haholo.""

This directly says the early submarines had a limited *range* for diving (ho thunya). The other options don't relate to the text's description of the submarines' early limitations."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang ya tlotseng tumellano? ","The correct answer is **D: Ma-Soviet**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Soviet Union violated the ""Treaty of Riga, the Non-Aggression Pact between the Soviet Union and Poland, and other international treaties.""  This means they broke the agreements.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa kang ya etswa ke Lebotho le Lefubedu ?,"The correct answer is **C: Ho hlophiswa botja haufi le borokgo** (Reorganizing near the border).

Here's why:

The passage states Poland's *hope* was to retreat and reorganize near Romania. It does *not* say the Red Army did any reorganizing. The passage specifically details the Red Army doing the following:

*   **A: Ho thehwa ha pele ha bala la ntwa la Ukraine** - They established a war front in Ukraine.
*   **B: Tlhaselo ya dibaka tse ka botjhabela** - They invaded eastern parts of Poland.
*   **D: Tlolo ya selekane** - They violated treaties (the Riga Peace Treaty, Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements).

Therefore, the one action *not* taken by the Red Army, according to the passage, is reorganizing near the border."
Ho etsahetseng ka Moenjiniere e Moholo wa Lebotho la Leshome la Italy?,"The correct answer is **C: O ile a haptjwa ke Ma-Brithani**.

The text states: ""Tlhaselong ya ho tsometsa ka botjhabela ba Bardia, Maborithani a hapile Moenjineri wa Sehlooho wa Ithali ya Maemong a Leshome Lebothong la Fatshe, Mojenerale Lastucci."" This translates to: ""During the advance towards Bardia, the British captured the Chief Engineer of the Italian Tenth Army, General Lastucci.""



"
Italo Balbo o bolailwe hokae?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk**.

The text states: ""Marshal Italo Balbo... was killed by anti-aircraft fire near Tobruk while flying over the area.""



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke efe ya mekhwa e latelang eo e leng karolo ya bohlokwa ya ho thuisa ha Tibetan?","The correct answer is **C: Ka ho bona medimo e sa tshwaneng metjha ya matla e a hlweka**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ntho ya bohlokwa ya ho thuisa ya Tibetan ke Modimo Yoga. Ka ho bona medimo e sa tshwaneng metjha ya matla e a hlweka, ho tsoswa di-chakra mme ho qala boikutlo ba ho behwa leseding.""

While the text *also* mentions breathing exercises (ho hema) and mantras, it identifies *seeing deities* as the crucial aspect of Tibetan meditative practice.  Learning about yoga methods is a broader context, not the core practice described.



"
"""Ho ya ka seratswana, di-chakras di kenngwa jwang nakong ya """"bohareng"""" ba ho thuisa ha Tibetan?""","The correct answer is **B: Ka ho bona medimo e sa tshwaneng metjha ya matla e a hlweka**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ka ho bona medimo e sa tshwaneng metjha ya matla e a hlweka, ho tsoswa di-chakra mme ho qala boikutlo ba ho behwa leseding.""  This directly links seeing deities to the awakening of chakras during Deity Yoga, a key aspect of Tibetan Buddhism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ka mekgwa e fapaneng ya yoga:** This is too general. While yoga is involved, the passage specifies *how* chakras are awakened.
*   **C: Ho pheta-pheta mantswe a mantra:** Mantras are mentioned as part of Kundalini Yoga, but not directly linked to chakra awakening in the context of Deity Yoga described in the passage.
*   **D: Ho ikwetlisa ho hema:** Similar to mantras, breathing exercises are part of the broader yoga practices but aren't the specific mechanism for chakra awakening described in the passage.



"
Ke mang ya ileng a hlahisa pina ya bobedi ya borapedi nakong ya lenaneo?,"The correct answer is **D: Jai Shankar Choudhary**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sebini Sanju Sharma o qadile phirimana, a latelwa ke Jai Shankar Choudhary eo le yena a faneng ka chhappan bhog bhajan."" This translates to ""Speaker Sanju Sharma started the prayer, followed by Jai Shankar Choudhary who also gave a chhappan bhog bhajan.""  Therefore, Jai Shankar Choudhary performed the second devotional song."
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke mang ya ileng a hlahisa pina ya borapedi nakong ya nyehelo ya dijo?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lakkha Singh a etella pele ho bina di-bhajan. Dipoleiti tse 108 tsa Chhappan Bhog...di ile tsa fanwa ho Baba Shyam. Lakkha Singh le yena o nyehetse ka chhappan bhog bhajan."" 

This means Lakkha Singh sang a *chhappan bhog bhajan* specifically *while* the offerings were being made (during the food offering/newhelo time). The other options are just mentioned as having sung bhajans at other points in the event."
Ke eng e ileng ya etswa karolong ya bobedi ya ho qetela mantsiboyeng ao?,"The correct answer is **A: Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina le Haris Alexiou**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sebini sa mosadi sa moTurkey Sezen Aksu a bina tinoro ya moIthali Alessandro Safina mmoho le sebini sa Mogeriki Haris Alexiou."" This directly describes what happened in the second to last part of the performance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mollo wa Anatolia (Fire of Anatolia)** - This was the *final* performance.
*   **C: Whirling Dervishes** - This happened *before* Aksu, Safina and Alexiou.
*   **D: Fatih Erkoç le Müslüm Gürses** - They were mentioned as part of the music that was *followed* by other acts, not the second to last act themselves.



"
Alessandro Safina ke oa setjhaba sefe?,"The correct answer is **D: Matadiana**.

The text states: ""Sebini sa mosadi sa moTurkey Sezen Aksu a bina tinoro ya moIthali Alessandro Safina mmoho le sebini sa Mogeriki Haris Alexiou."" This translates to ""Turkish female singer Sezen Aksu sang a duet with Italian singer Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.""

Therefore, Alessandro Safina is Italian."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho dipolelo tse latelang eo e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **A: Ho bile le mollo Santa Clara**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states there was a heatwave in Santa Clara**, with temperatures reaching 90°F. It does *not* mention a fire.
*   **B: Batho ba ne ba sitwa ho tswa ka hara di-roller coaster** is true; the passage says people were trapped on the roller coaster.
*   **C: Bapalami ba ne ba fuwa metsi** is true; the first sentence states ""Baeti ba fuwe metsi"".
*   **D: Ho nkile bonyane metsotso e-60 ho theola motho wa pele** is true; the passage explicitly says it took at least one hour (60 minutes) to rescue the first person.

Therefore, the only statement that is *not* true based on the passage is that there was a fire in Santa Clara."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang ya faneng ka maikutlo mabapi le boemo bo sa thabiseng ba motjheso?","The correct answer is **B: Molaodi wa mollo**.

The passage states: ""Mokaptene wa mollo Scott Kouns o itse, """"E ne e le letsatsi le tjhesang Santa Clara ka metjhesong e phahameng ho fihla ho bo-90°C."""" This directly translates to ""Fire Captain Scott Kouns said, """"It was a hot day in Santa Clara with temperatures reaching 90°F."""" 

Therefore, the fire captain is the one who commented on the uncomfortable heat.
"
Motlakase o ile wa kgaoha hokae ka lebaka la tsunami?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

The text states: ""Ha ho tshenyo e kgolo kapa ditemalo tse tlalehilweng mane Tonga, empa motlakase o kgaohile nakwana..."" (There was no major damage or reports in Tonga, but the electricity went out briefly...). This directly links the power outage to Tonga."
"Ho latela seratswana, Tonga e ile ya angwa jwang ke ho kgaoha ha motlakase?","The correct answer is **B: Ba boholong ha baa ka ba fumana ditaba tse mabapi le ditemoso tse phahamisitsweng**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the power outage ""reportedly prevented Tongan officials from receiving the tsunami warning issued by PTWC."" This directly means they couldn't get the information about the warnings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho bile le tshenyo e itseng** - The passage states ""there was no major damage or casualties reported in Tonga.""
*   **C: Ho balwa ha bophahamo ba lewatle ho ile ha ameha** - The passage doesn't mention anything about sea level measurements.
*   **D: Ba boholong ha baa kgona ho fumana ditemoso tse amehang** - While this is related, the specific issue was that *officials* couldn't receive the warnings, hindering their ability to inform the public. The passage specifically highlights the impact on officials.



"
Mapolesa a khonne neng ho sebedisa dithunya tsa bona tsa radar ho tshwara lebelo la ho khanna la Jonny Reid?,"The correct answer is **A: Ha a ntse a kganna ka lebelo la 160km/h**.

The text states: ""lekgetlo le le leng leo mapolesa a kgonneng ho fumana lebelo la Mong Reid ke ha a fokoletsa lebelo la koloi ya hae ho 160km/h.""  This directly translates to ""the only time police were able to get a speed reading of Mr. Reid was when he slowed the car down to 160km/h."""
"Ho latela seratswana, ke hobaneng ha ho ne ho le thata hore mapolesa a New Zealand a shebe lebelo la Jonny Reid?","The correct answer is **B: Koloi e ne e le tlase haholo**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Mapolesa a New Zealand a fumane bothata ba ho ka sebedisa dithunya tsa bona tsa radar ya lebelo ho bona hore na Mong Reid o palame ka lebelo le lekae ka lebaka la ka moo Black Beauty e manameng fatshe ka teng."" This means the police had trouble getting a reading because of how low the car was to the ground.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: O ne a kganna ka tlase ho 160km/h** - The passage indicates he was *exceeding* speeds of 160km/h, not driving below it.
*   **C: O ile a kganna borokhong makgetlo a supileng feela** - The number of times he drove across doesn't explain the difficulty in reading the speed.
*   **D: Auckland Harbor Bridge ke ya kgale haholo** - The age of the bridge is irrelevant to the issue of reading the car's speed.



"
Tshisinyeho ya lefatshe e ne e le hokae kamanong le Butte?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 dimmaele ka borwa**.

The text states the earthquake's epicenter was ""about 65 km (40 miles) south of Butte""."
Ho etsahetseng nakong ya moferefere Abu Ghraib?,"The correct answer is **A: Tlhekefetso ya batshwaruoa** (Abuse of prisoners).

The passage explicitly states that the Abu Ghraib prison became infamous *after* prisoner abuse was revealed there.  The other options are things that happened, but the *reason* for the infamy is the abuse.



"
Hobaneng ha tjhankana ya Iraq e ile ya tsebahala? ,"The correct answer is **D: Ho sibollwa ha tlhekefetso ya batshwaruwa** (The discovery of a prisoner's escape).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the prison became notorious *after* a prisoner escape was discovered after US forces retook it. The other options are either inaccurate or not the primary reason for the prison's infamy, as presented in the text.

*   **A: E ile ya tjhesoa ka mollo** (It was burned down) - The text doesn't mention this.
*   **B: Mabotho a-US a ile a nka taolo** (US forces took control) - While true, this wasn't *why* it became famous.
*   **C: Ho ne ho e-na le merusu e mengata** (There was a lot of abuse) - The text indicates abuse happened *within* the prison, but the escape is what brought it to public attention."
Ho ne ho tla tshwarelwa ketsahalo ya mofuta ofe Lebaleng la Sehopotso la Ntwa la Maui?,"The correct answer is **C: Konsarete**.

The text explicitly states that Bente held a **konsarete** (concert) at the Maui War Memorial Stadium. The passage then discusses the concert being canceled and apologies to attendees."
Ke mang ya ileng a qetella a fane ka tlhaloso mabapi le ho hlakolwa ha ketsahalo eo?,"The correct answer is **B: Khampani ya tsamaiso**.

The text states that HK Management Inc. (the management company) *eventually* provided an explanation for the cancellation.  While they didn't initially, they later said it was due to logistical reasons for the following day.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sehlopha:** The text doesn't mention the band giving an explanation.
* **C: Monga Lebala la Sehopotso sa Ntwa:** The stadium is mentioned as the location, but not as giving a reason.
* **D: Barati:**  The text says the band apologized *to* the fans, but didn't give the reason for the cancellation themselves.



"
Baahi ba mmalwa ba Bishkek ba ne ba nahana hore ke mang ya ikarabellang bakeng sa boshodu boo?,"The correct answer is **C: Baipelaetsi**.

The passage states: ""Badudi ba mmalwa ba Bishkek ba jarisitse baipelaetsi ba tswang ka borwa bakeng sa meferefere ena ya tlhokeho ya molao."" This directly translates to ""Several residents of Bishkek blamed southern migrants for this wave of lawlessness.""
"
Ke mang ya ileng a beha baipelaetsi ba tswang ka borwa molato bakeng sa boshodu?,"The correct answer is **A: Baahi ba Bishkek** (Residents of Bishkek).

The passage states: ""Badudi ba mmalwa ba Bishkek ba jarisitse baipelaetsi ba tswang ka borwa bakeng sa meferefere ena ya tlhokeho ya molao."" This directly translates to ""Several residents of Bishkek blamed southerners for this wave of lawlessness.""
"
Ring e fumane thekiso e eketsehileng neng?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka mora ho hlaha ho Shark Tank**.

The passage specifically states: ""Dithekiso di phahame kamora boitlhahiso ba hae ka 2013 lenaneong la Shark Tank..."" (Sales increased after his 2013 appearance on Shark Tank...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ka mora ho fumana tjhelete ka-2013:** While the appearance on Shark Tank was in 2013, the passage indicates the sales *increase* happened *after* the appearance, not just the year. Importantly, the investors *rejected* his idea.
*   **C: Ka mora ho hlaha ho QVC:** The passage mentions a QVC appearance in late 2017, but doesn't state that it led to increased sales.
*   **D: Ka mora ho rarolla nyewe le ADT:** The passage mentions the partnership with ADT, but doesn't link it to a specific sales increase.



"
Jamie Siminoff o nkile qeto ya ho qala Lesale neng?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka mora ponahalo ya Shark Tank e hlolehileng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dithekiso di phahame kamora boitlhahiso ba hae ka 2013 lenaneong la Shark Tank moo moifo wa lenaneo o ileng wa hana ho tshehetsa qalo ya kgwebo ya hae."" This directly implies Jamie Siminoff started/continued developing Ring *after* being rejected on Shark Tank, likely spurred on by the exposure even though he didn't get funding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ka mor'a ho hlokomela hore tshepe ya hae ya monyako e ne e sa lekana** - This describes the *initial problem* that motivated him, not when he started the business.
*   **C: Ka mora ho fumana tjhelete** - The passage indicates he didn't get funding from Shark Tank initially.
*   **D: Ka mora ponahalo e atlehileng ya QVC** - The QVC appearance happened *later* in 2017, after Ring was already established.



"
Karolo ka nngwe ya Reading Rainbow e fa bana dikgothalletso tsa eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Dibuka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lenaneo ka leng le fana ka dibuka tse kgothalletswang tseo bana ba lokelang ho di batla ha ba e ya laebrari."" (The program often provided suggested books that children should seek out when they went to the library.) 

This directly indicates that *Reading Rainbow* encouraged children to find and read **books**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dipontsho tsa thelevishene (Television shows)** - While *Reading Rainbow* *is* a television show, it doesn't give encouragement *of* television shows.
*   **B: Dilaebrari tsa lehae (Local libraries)** - The program encourages going *to* the library, but doesn't give encouragement *of* libraries themselves.
*   **C: Dihlooho (Headings)** - The program focuses on themes and topics from books, but the encouragement is ultimately to read the *books* themselves, not just think about the headings.



"
E ka nna ya ba ke eng e bakileng ho hlakolwa ha letoto la Reading Rainbow?,"The correct answer is **A: Tjhelete e sa lekaneng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ba bang ba dumela, ho akarelletsa le John Grant, hore ka bobedi ba fanang ka ditjhelete le ho fetoha ha filosofi ya mananeo a thelevishene a rutang ho tlatseditse ho fedisweng ha lenaneo."" This directly implies that a lack of funding (ba fanang ka ditjhelete) contributed to the cancellation of the show.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ho hloka dikgau tsa Emmy:** The passage doesn't mention Emmy awards at all.
*   **C: Maikutlo a John Grant:** While John Grant is quoted, the passage says his *opinion* is that funding and philosophical changes led to the cancellation, not that his feelings *caused* it.
*   **D: Katleho ya Baahelani wa Monghadi Rogers:** The passage only compares *Reading Rainbow* to *Motseng wa Monghadi Rogers*, it does not suggest the latter's success led to the former's cancellation.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa kang ya etswa khang ke ba boholong bakeng sa Amsterdam le musiamo mabapi le sefate?,"The correct answer is **A: Ha ho pelaelo hore se tla wa**.

Here's why:

The passage states the authorities *believe* the statue is loose and potentially dangerous (""kotsi ya bophelong ba setjhaba kaha ba re se ne se le kotsing ya ho atamela ho wa""). They were planning to remove it.  They didn't definitively *know* it would fall, only that there was a risk.

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned in the text:

*   **B: Se lokela ho bolokwa** - The statue *was* saved from being removed (""se ile sa bolokwa kamora nyewe ya ka lekgotleng"").
*   **C: Se silafaditsoe ke hlobo** - The passage explicitly states the authorities believe the statue is loose (""sefate se anngwe ke hlobo"").
*   **D: Se kotsi ho bophelo bo botle ba setjhaba** - This is directly stated as the reason for concern (""kotsi ya bophelong ba setjhaba"").



"
"Ho ya ka mohlahlobi ya ka sehloohong wa RSPCA, tlhahlobo e lokela ho ba e tlwaelehileng bakeng sa efe ho tse latelang?","The correct answer is **B: Mang kapa mang ya sebetsang le diphoofolo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that David O'Shannessy believes ""bodisa le ditlhahlobo tsa dilakgapane di tlameha ho atiswa naheng ya Australia"" and that ""CCTV e tla feela e romele letshwao le matla ho batho ba sebetsang ka diphoofolo hore tshwaro ya tsona e ntle ke taba ya bohlokwa bo phahameng ka ho fetisisa.""  This clearly indicates he wants monitoring (through CCTV and presumably other means) of *people working with animals*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dikhamera tsa CCTV:** While CCTV is *part* of the solution, the focus isn't on the cameras themselves, but what they monitor.
*   **C: Disebedidiswa tsa ho beha leihlo:** This is too broad. The passage focuses on those working with animals, not general surveillance devices.
*   **D: Dibaka tsa ho hlaba diphoofolo:** While relevant, the passage doesn't limit the monitoring to just slaughterhouses. It's about all people working with animals.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke thuto efe e kenyeletswang boithutong ba porofeshenale?","The correct answer is **A: Thuso ea pele**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that a standard training course ""will include a lot of first aid."" The other options are mentioned in the passage, but not as components *included* in the professional training:

*   **B: Dibaka tse nang le ntwa (War zones)** - The passage says training is *for* visiting war zones, but doesn't say war zones themselves are *part* of the training.
*   **C: Ho hlola diqholotso tsa lefelleng (Surviving the wilderness)** - While wilderness survival skills are relevant, the passage focuses on the specific needs of traveling to conflict areas.
*   **D: Dibaka tse tletseng bora (Areas full of holes/dangers)** - This refers to the search term used to find the training company, not a component of the training itself.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mokhwa ofe wa mantlha o ka o thusang ho qoba metsi a kanna ya ba a ditshila?","The correct answer is **B: Reka metsi a dibotlolong**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ha o ka ba le ho tshwenyeha, o lokela ho nahanela ho reka metsi a hao lebotlolong le kwetsweng le tswang k’hampaneng e tshepahalang."" This directly suggests buying bottled water from a reputable company as a way to avoid contaminated water when you have concerns.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bedisa metsi metsotso e itseng:** While the passage mentions boiling water for a certain amount of time, it doesn't present it as the *main* way to avoid contaminated water, just a method that works in some places.
*   **C: Bedisa metsi motsotso:** The passage states that sometimes boiling for *several* minutes is needed, not just one minute.
*   **D: Lekola metsi bakeng sa kotsi e ka bang teng:** The passage doesn't mention testing the water for contaminants.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e batlang e ke ke ya kgoneha le ho disesi tse nang le boiphihlelo?","The correct answer is **C: Ho sesa kgahlanong le sefutho sa metsi** (Swimming against the current).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Batho ba bangata ba shwa ka lebaka la ho kgathala ba leka ho sesa kgahlanong le phallo, ho ka bang boima ho ho etsa."" (Many people die from exhaustion trying to swim against the current, which can be difficult to do).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho sesetsa haufi le mafika** (Swimming near waterfalls) - While dangerous, the passage doesn't say *experienced* swimmers can't do this, only that rip currents often form near them.
*   **B: Ho sesetsa kwetseng** (Swimming calmly) - The passage doesn't mention difficulty with calm swimming.
*   **D: Ho sesa o potoloha maqhubu** (Swimming around eddies) - The passage mentions eddies as a place where faster currents can form, but doesn't say it's impossible to swim around them.



"
Ke eng seo o lokelang ho se etsa ha o khangwa ke sefutho sa metsi?,"The correct answer is **A: Leka ho tswa ka ho ya sebakeng se seng, ebe o sesa o kgutlela lebopong ka tlwaelo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hang fela ha otswa hare ho phallo, ho sesa o kgutlela moraho ha ho sa le boima ho fela ka ho tlwaelehileng."" This directly translates to ""Once you are out of the current, swimming back to shore becomes easier to do normally.""  It emphasizes escaping the current and *then* swimming to safety.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sesa kapele kgahlanong le metsi** - The passage specifically warns that people *die* trying to swim against the current because it's too exhausting.
* **C: Sesa ka nqa e fapaneng** - The passage doesn't mention swimming at a different angle.
* **D: Sesa ka tlasa metsi** - The passage doesn't mention or suggest swimming underwater.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke sebakeng sefe moo ho ka tjhakelwang qhobosheaneng se ka etsang hore e ba leeto la bohlokwa la matsatsi a phomolo?","The correct answer is **C: Phuleng ya Rhine**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""phuleng ya Rhine"" as an example of an inland waterway that can be a good place to visit for a vacation. While the other options are also mentioned, the Rhine is presented as a concrete example of a desirable destination.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang ke keletso efe e sa kgothaletsweng basadi ba etelang sebaka seo?","The correct answer is **C: Qoba ho rwala mabenyane a turu**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""hoa thusa hape ho rwala reng (empa e sa shebahaleng e bitsa haholo)"". This means it *advises* women to drink a little (but not to drink excessively, as it attracts attention). Therefore, avoiding drinking altogether is NOT the advice given.

Let's look at why the other options are advice *from* the passage:

*   **A: Tlohela ho bua ka ditaba tsa boemo ba lenyalo:** The passage specifically says women should state their marital status.
*   **B: Hlokomela hore ho setshwane hwa setso ho ka baka batho ba lehae ba ntshe maikutlo ka mokwa o hlohleletsang:** The passage explicitly warns about cultural differences affecting perceptions.
*   **D: Bua ka thata ha ho hlokahala:** The passage advises women to ""show firmness"" when refusing men.

"Re ipapisitse le tlhaloso ya sebaka seratswaneng, ke eng e ka bang keletso e thusang baeti ba basadi?","The correct answer is **D: Moo o sa batleng, tiisa ho hana banna**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Bontsha ho tiya ha o hana banna, mme o se ke wa tshaba ho ema o tiile (ho ka ba le diphapang tsa setso kapa tjhe, seo ha se ho etse hore e be ntho e lokileng!)."" This directly advises women to firmly refuse unwanted advances.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Elellwa hore ha hwa tlwaleha ho salwa morao:** The passage actually says it's *okay* to be left alone/not feel pressured to engage. It doesn't say you *should* expect it.
* **B: Rwala reng e kgolo ho bontsha hore o nyetswe:** While the passage mentions a ring, it says it's not very noticeable and can be expensive.  It doesn't recommend relying on it.
* **C: Utlwisisa hore ho fapana hwa setso ho etsa hore o qobe ho ikemela:** The passage cautions that cultural differences *can affect perception* of harassment, but it *doesn't* suggest women should compromise their boundaries or not stand up for themselves. In fact, it emphasizes the importance of asserting oneself even in the face of cultural nuances.

"Ho latela seratswana, ke maemo afe ao ho ka hlokahalang hore motho ya nkang diphoofolo tse hlaha difoto a sebedise dilense tse kgethehileng?","The correct answer is **A: Haeba o nka foto ya phoofolo tse nyane** (If you are taking pictures of small animals).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...dintho tse tshwanang le dinyonyane tse ngata kapa dibopuwa tse nyenyane di hloka dilense tse ding."" (things like many birds or small mammals require different lenses).  This directly links the need for special lenses to photographing smaller animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Haeba difoto tseo di tlo rekiswa** (If those photos are going to be sold): While the passage mentions rules about commercial photography, it doesn't say *that's* when special lenses are needed.
*   **C: Haeba diphoofolo tse nkwang difoto di le dihlong** (If the animals being photographed are dangerous): The passage mentions dangerous animals as a factor in wildlife photography generally, but not specifically as requiring different lenses.
*   **D: Haeba sebaka seo se na le melao e kgethehileng mabapi le ho nka diphoofolo tse hlaha difoto** (If the area has specific rules about taking wildlife photos):  Like B, this relates to regulations, not lens choice.



"
Ke eng e sa bolelwang seratswaneng eo e leng phephetso ho batho ba nkang difoto?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho fumana diphoofolo tse sa tlwaelehang**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ho boima ho fumana diphoofolo tse ngata tsa mafatsheng a mang..."" (It is difficult to find many animals from other parts of the world). This directly relates to the challenge of photographing wildlife - the animals themselves aren't always easy to locate.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Ho sebetsana le diphoofolo tse mabifi:** The text mentions animals having horns or claws, implying potential danger, but doesn't focus on *dealing* with dangerous animals as a primary challenge.
*   **C: Ho fumana mefuta ea dilense tse hlokwang:** While the text *mentions* needing specific lenses, it doesn’t frame this as the biggest hurdle. It states different animals require different lenses, but doesn’t imply difficulty *finding* those lenses.
*   **D: Ho sebetsa dibakeng tse ka bang le bora:** The text mentions harsh environments (cold, hot, dusty), but doesn't specifically say these are the biggest difficulties.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke eng e ka bakang mathata a fokolang ho bakganni ba kgannang tseleng tse dithabeng?","The correct answer is **D: Ponahalo e fokotsehileng** (Reduced visibility).

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions that visibility can be hindered by:

*   ""Ice fog or freezing rain""
*   ""Frost or ice on vehicle windows""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sephethephethe se seholo (Strong winds):** While winds can be a factor in mountainous areas, the passage focuses on issues caused by ice and snow.
*   **B: Kgohlano e tlaase (Low friction):** The passage *describes* low friction (""it is very slippery and you cannot drive as if on a dry surface"") but doesn't state it as a cause of difficulty directly. The ice/snow *causes* the low friction.
*   **C: Mouwane wa metsi o fetoha mokedikedi o mongata (Water mist turns into abundant frost):** The passage does mention frost, but not as a primary cause of difficulty. The fog/frost is what *reduces* visibility.



"
Ke eng e ka dulang e tsitsitse ka lekeno la lekgetho dinaheng tse fapaneng?,"The correct answer is **A: Ditefiso**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""ditheko tsa lekgetho le mefuta di fapana haholo ho ya ka dinaha."" This directly translates to ""the costs and types of taxes vary greatly depending on the country.""  While the *structure* (B) might have similarities, the passage emphasizes the **differences in costs (ditefiso)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sebopeho (Structure):** While the way taxes are *organized* may have some common elements, the passage focuses on how much they *cost*.
* **C: Moo o bolokang difaele (Where you file):** The passage mentions filing in the country you live in, but doesn’t say this is a constant factor.
* **D: Masakana (Issues):**  The passage doesn’t discuss issues or problems with taxes.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, haeba o sebetsa mose ho mawatle empa o dula sebakeng se seng o tla be o ntse o tlatsa lekgetho kae?","The correct answer is **A: Hoohle moo u fumanehang teng hangata** (Wherever you are most often located).

Here's why:

The passage states you need to register for income tax in the country where you *reside*. While working abroad is mentioned, the key factor for tax registration is your place of residence.  The phrasing ""Hoohle moo u fumanehang teng hangata"" best captures the idea of your primary residence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Amerika (America):** The passage only mentions the United States as an example of a country with federal and local taxes, not as the definitive place to file.
*   **C: Naheng eo o sebetsang ho yona (The country you work in):** While you might have tax obligations in the country you work in *as well*, the primary obligation is to the country where you reside.
*   **D: Moo ditifiso di leng tlaase (Where certifications are lowest):** This option is irrelevant to the text."
Ke polelo efe ho tse latelang e sa hlaloseng ka nepo Dipontsho tsa Lefatshe?,"The correct answer is **B: Dipontsho tsa dipalesa mmoho le dimela di behwa mmoho le dipontsho tsa bonono le thuto**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that International Horticultural Expositions *focus* on plants and gardening, and are separate from the general World's Fairs which cover a broader range of innovation and culture.  It doesn't say they are combined with art and education displays *within* the main World's Fair.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Dipontsho di ka bontsha setso sa nalane kapa moetlo wa naha** - The passage states nations ""exhibit their culture and history.""
*   **C: Diketsahalo di ka nka ho fihlela dikgweli tse tsheletseng** - The passage mentions fairs last ""from three to six months.""
*   **D: Dinaha ha di tlamehe ho nka karolo** - While not directly stated, the phrasing ""countries *participating*..."" implies participation is optional.



"
Ke eng ho tse latelang e leng molao wa dipontsho tsa lefatshe kapa dipontsho tsa matjhaba?,"The correct answer is **B: Naha e tshwaneng e ke ke ya tshwara diketsahalo tsena selemo le selemo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Le hoja ha ho bolelwa di ka etsahala ka selemo (hafeela di le dibakeng tse fapa-fapaneng), ka sebele ha ho jwalo.""  This directly translates to ""Although it is spoken of that they can happen every year (as long as they are in different locations), this is certainly not the case."" This means a country cannot host them annually.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While national history and global issues *can* be showcased, the text doesn't state this is a *requirement*.
*   **C:** The text says the events usually last 3-6 months, not necessarily 6 months.
*   **D:** Dinaha di tlameha ho nka karolo (Countries must participate) is not mentioned as a rule for holding the expositions.



"
Ho ka etswang ho tse latelang e ka fokotsang menyetla ya hore diphoofolo li hlasele?,"The correct answer is **C: Ho ba hole le diphiri bohato ba maoto a 25** (Staying 25 feet away from bears).

Here's why:

*   **The passage specifically states:** ""dula bonnyane di-yard/mithara tse 100 hole le dibere le diphiri le di-yard/mithara tse 25 ho diphoofolo tsohle tsa naha."" (stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and mountain lions and 25 yards/meters from all wildlife).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho jara ditlama tse monko o monate** (Planting fragrant flowers) - The passage warns *against* strong smells, as they attract animals.
*   **B: Ho tlosa dithole kampong** (Removing holes in the campsite) - This isn't mentioned in the passage as a way to prevent attacks.
*   **D: Ho thibela diphoofolo ka makumane a dijo** (Distracting animals with piles of food) - This would *attract* animals, increasing the risk of an encounter.



"
Ke eng ho tse latelang e sa bolelwang seratswaneng e ka bakang sesosa sa ho hlaselwa ke diphoofolo tse hlaha?,"The correct answer is **A: Menko e bohale (Strong smells)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""monko o bitsa dibere le diphoofolo tse ding tsa naha, kahoo qoba ho tshwara kapa ho pheha dijo tse nang le monko mme o boloke kampo e hlwekile."" This means strong smells attract animals, increasing the risk of an encounter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ho hlolwa ho ba hole le tsona haholo (Being too far away from them):** The passage emphasizes *staying* a safe distance *from* the animals, not being too far away generally.
* **C: Ho fepa diphoofolo tse hlaha (Feeding wild animals):** The passage directly states that animals should *not* be fed.
* **D: Diphoofolo tse sa tlwaelang batho (Animals not used to people):** The passage actually says the animals *are* used to seeing people, but are still dangerous.
