"Marka loo eego qoraalka, maxaa aan loo qaadan doonin tilmaan sax ah oo si guul leh loogu ciyaaro turumbada?","The correct answer is **A: Si aad u hesho mugga dheeraadka ah, kordhi xoogga aad ku dhufatey furayaasha**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Xasuusnoow inaanay jirin wax baahiya oo aad u qabto inaad ku cadaadiso furayaasha si aad codka u dheerayso sida biyaanada."" This directly contradicts option A, which suggests increasing the force with which you hit the keys.

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with the text:

*   **B:** ""Qaabkan, waxaad daaleysaa inta ugu yare e suurtogal ah... Ku ilaali dhaq-dhaqaaqa aan loo baahnayn xadiga u hooseeya"" – This matches the idea of minimizing unnecessary movement.
*   **C:** ""...isku day inaanad dhaqaaq dhib ah gacantaada ku samayn."" – This supports keeping a relaxed hand.
*   **D:** ""Foorida, si aad cod dheeraada u hesho, waxaad adeegsanaysaa tuunbooyinka oo xawaaraha iyo cadaadiska loo kordhiyay."" – This aligns with increasing speed (and implicitly, technique) on the pedals to increase volume.

"Markaad ciyaareyso turumbada, midkee ayaa kuwan soo socda gacan ka geysan doona kordhinta mugga?","The correct answer is **A: Xawaare badan** (Higher speed).

Here's why, based on the provided text:

The text explicitly states: ""Foorida, si aad cod dheeraada u hesho, waxaad adeegsanaysaa tuunbooyinka oo xawaaraha iyo cadaadiska loo kordhiyay.""  This translates to ""When typing, to get a louder sound, you use the keys with increased speed and pressure.""

While pressure (B: Xoog badan) is mentioned, the text emphasizes **speed** as a key component of increasing volume.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **C: Cadaadis yar** (Less pressure) - The text says to *increase* pressure, not decrease it.
*   **D: Dhaqdhaqaaqa farta oo yaraada** (Reduced finger movement) - The text suggests efficiency in movement, but doesn’t say less movement equals louder sound. It aims for minimal fatigue, not minimal action."
Maxay tahay sababta muuqaaladda telefishinada loo jaraa xuduudahooda?,"The correct answer is **B: Markaa muuqaalku wuxuu buuxiyaa shaashadda oo dhan**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Tani ayaa loo yeelaa si uu sawirka u buuxiyo shaashada oo dhan."" (This was done so the image would fill the entire screen.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Si loogu ogolaado qoraal-hoosaadyo** - While cropping *can* affect subtitles, the primary reason isn't to accommodate them. The passage actually mentions issues with subtitles *because* of the cropping.
*   **C: Si loogu oggolaado beddelaada fudud ee qaabab kale** - The passage doesn't mention anything about easy changes to other formats.
*   **D: Si loo jaro qoraal-hoosaadyo aad ugu dhow xagga hoose** - This is a *result* of the cropping, not the reason *for* it."
"Marka loo eego marinka, dhibaatooyinka soo socda midkee la kulmi kara marka filim loo beddelayo qaab DVD?","The correct answer is **B: Qayb hoosaadyada jaran**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that when making a DVD, sides can be cropped, and if subtitles are near the bottom of the screen, they might be *completely* cut off. This directly relates to subtitles being cut off.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Muuqaal aan buuxin shaashadda oo dhan:** The passage explains that televisions often *crop* to fill the screen, so a DVD might not necessarily have this issue.
*   **C: Muuqaal buuxinaya shaashadda oo dhan:** While this is the goal of the general scan, the passage highlights issues that can occur *during* the DVD conversion process.
*   **D: Xuduudaha jara:** While cropping *is* mentioned, the specific issue raised is about subtitles being affected by cropping at the bottom of the screen."
Xaggee ku tiillay xerada ciidanka Ingiriiska?,"The correct answer is **C: Bordentown**.

The text states that General Cadwalder launched a ""diversionary attack"" against the British forces stationed in **Bordentown** to draw them in. The main attack was aimed at Trenton, but the diversion was at Bordentown."
Kee ayuu saxeexiisu ka muuqday qabyo qoraalka gacanta lagu qoray?,"The correct answer is **D: Charles Thomson**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Qoraal gacanta lagu qoray oo ay ku saxeexan yihiin Madaxwaynaha Koongareeska John Hancock iyo Xoghaye **Charles Thomson**..."" This directly identifies Charles Thomson as one of the signers of the handwritten document.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: John Dunlap** - He was the printer, not a signer.
*   **B: George Washington** - He received a copy and read it to his troops, but didn't sign the original.
*   **C: John Nixon** - He was the one who did the first public reading, but not a signer."
"Marka laga reebo meelaha soo socda, xaggee buu ka yimid barxadka ballaaran ee Dunlap?","The correct answer is **B: Dukaanka daabacaadda ee Dunlap**.

Here's why:

The text states the ""bugaag Dunlap"" were created by John Dunlap's print shop (""madbacadii John Dunlap""). The question asks where the broadside originated *from* besides the listed locations. Therefore, the print shop is the logical answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: New York** - The text doesn't mention New York as a place of origin for the broadsides.
*   **C: London** - London *received* a copy, but didn't originate it.
*   **D: Hoolka Madaxbanaanida** - Independence Hall was where the first public reading took place, not where the broadsides were printed."
Xaggee ayay ku sugnaayeen Gaashaanle Sare Stark ciidamadiisa?,"The correct answer is **A: Dhammaadka dhinaca woqooyi, oo ku teedsan xeyndaabka**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Raga Stark waxay qateen dhamaan goobaha xudduuda ee dhamaadka qeybta waqooyiga ee goobaha gumeystayasha."" This directly translates to Stark's men taking all the border positions at the northern end of the colonies' locations, which is described as being along the boundary (xeyndaabka).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Xeebta biyaha geeskooda** - The text only mentions a short stone wall ending near a small cove (dacalka xeeb yar), not that they were stationed *on* the beach itself.
* **C: Dhanka waqooyi bari ee gacan biyoodka** - While the location is in the southeast of the handhold, Stark’s positions were specifically at the *northern end* of the colonial locations.
* **D: Xeyndaabka hortiisa** - The text states they fortified *along* the boundary, not in front of it. The safe zone was established *in front* of the wall, but their initial positions were on the boundary itself.



"
"Marka loo eego qoraalka, goorma ayay ragga Stark waasiciyeen xayndaabkooda?","The correct answer is **C: Muddadii lagu jiray mowjadda hoose**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Markii mawjad hoose dalool ka sameysay meel la siman Webiga Mystic ee ku yaal koonfurta bari ee gacan biyoodka, ayay si dhakhso leh ugu kordhiyeen dayrkii gidaar gaaban oo dhagax ka samaysan...""  This directly links the expansion of their defenses to the occurrence of the low tide.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Goortii uu Gumaystuhu ku baaqay in la xoojiyo** - The text doesn't mention a call to fortify defenses.
*   **B: Ka dib markii kuwa caadiga ahi ay gudbiyeen saamiga** - The text mentions *not* letting civilians pass until they had, but does not say they expanded *after* civilians passed.
*   **D: Goortii ay ciidammadii qaateen boosaska hore** - While they held the frontier positions, the text specifically states they expanded *during* the low tide.



"
"Marka loo eego qoraalka, kee ayaa kuwan soo socda ah mid ka mid ah waayihii ugu rabshadaha badnaa ee China ?","The correct answer is **D: Waagii Saddexda Boqortooyo**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Saddexda boqortooya ayaa ahaayeen xilliyada ugu dhiig daadinta badnaa ee taariikhda Shiinaha Qadiimka kumanaan qof ayaa ku dhintay inay ku fariistaank kursiga ugu sare ee boqortooyada wayn ee Xi’an."" 

The other options are mentioned as periods *surrounding* the Three Kingdoms, but are not directly identified as the most violent."
"Marka loo eego marinka, maxaa ka run ah in kooxaha quraanyada ahi inay galeen marxalad reer guura ah?","The correct answer is **B: Waxay haystaan sahay cunto oo yar**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kooxdu waxay biloowdaa heer reer guuraanimo marka cuntada diyaarka ah yaraato."" (The group begins a nomadic phase when ready-made food is scarce). This directly links the start of the nomadic phase to a lack of food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Habeenkii bey buul galaan:** While they *do* march at night, this isn't *why* they enter the nomadic phase.
*   **C: Waxay sameeyaan buulal la beddelo 17 maalmood ka dib:** The passage says the guard duty rotation lasts approximately 17 days, not that the shelters are changed every 17 days.
*   **D: Maalintii ayay socdaan:** They march at *night*, not during the day.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, oraahdee ayaa si sax ah uga tarjumeysa hab-dhaqanka buul-ku-galka kooxaha quraanyada xilliga marxaladda reer-guuraaga?","The correct answer is **C: Waxay beddelaan buulasha maalin kasta**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Inta lagu jiro heerkan, kooxdu waxay sameysaa buulal ku meelgaara kuwaaso maalin kasta la beddelo."" (During this phase, the group makes makeshift shelters that are changed every day.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waxay dhistaan buulal habeenkii** - The text says they *move* at night and go to camps during the day, not that they build shelters at night.
*   **B: Waxay socdaan 17 maalmood iyaga oo aan buul lahayn** - The text states each shift *lasts* around 17 days, not that they go without shelters for 17 days. They *have* shelters, but change them daily.
*   **D: Waxay isticmaalaan buulal isku mid ah inta lagu jiro marxaladda** - The text clearly states they make *new* shelters every day, meaning they don't use the same ones.



"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda ayaa sii wadmi doona in kasta oo ay jiraan tilmaamo dibadeed?,"The correct answer is **C: Saacadaha noolaha**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Saacadaha nolaha ayaa ay saacado keligooda iswadaan oo soconayaan keligooda xitaa haday waayaan baaqyo dibadda ka imaado."" This directly means internal biological clocks will continue functioning even without external cues.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Wareegyada Endogenous:** While related to internal rhythms, the passage focuses on the specific instance of biological clocks (saacadaha noolaha). ""Endogenous cycles"" is a broader term.
*   **B: Laxanka xilliyeedka:** This refers to seasonal rhythms and *would* be affected by external cues like changes in daylight.
*   **D: Laxanka loo fiirsaday:** This relies on observing external phenomena and therefore *would* be dependent on external cues.



"
Kelmadee ayaa qeexaysa shakhsiyaadka muujiya kala duwanaanshiyaha sifo gaar ah?,"The correct answer is **D: Qaabab dhawr ah**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Marka qofku yeesho dhowr oo dhaqan gaara ah waxay noqdaan **qaabab-badnayaal**."" This directly translates to ""When an individual has multiple distinct traits, they become **polymorphs** (or, in this context, 'qaabab dhawr ah').""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hal qaable:** This doesn't relate to the definition given in the passage.
*   **B: Noolaha:** This refers to a population in general, not individuals with varying traits.
*   **C: Noocyada:** This refers to a specific type of organism, not the variation *within* a population.



"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda ereyga saxda ah ee noolaha ku nool meel gaar ah?,"The correct answer is **B: Dadweynaha**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tirada guud ayaa ah uruurinta noolaha oo nooc gaar ah oo ku nool goob juquraafi ah."" This directly defines a population as a collection of organisms of a specific type living in a geographical area.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Hal qaable:** This likely refers to a single organism, not a group.
    * **C: Noocyada:** This refers to classifications of organisms, not the organisms themselves living in a place.
    * **D: Qaabab dhawr ah:** This refers to individuals with multiple traits (polymorphism), not the group as a whole.

Therefore, **Dadweynaha** (Population) is the most accurate translation of the definition given in the passage."
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan noqon doonin tusaale dhaqdhaqaaqa dalxiiska ee ku salaysan dabeecadda?,"Jawaabta saxda ah waa **C: Booqashada matxafka sayniska**.

**Sabab:**

Dhaqdhaqaaqa dalxiiska ee ku salaysan dabeecadda wuxuu ku saabsan yahay in la la kulmo oo la barto deegaanka dabiiciga.

*   **A: U socoshada biyo-dhac** waa tusaale dabiici ah oo dalxiis ah.
*   **B: Sawir qaadista ubaxyada duurka** waa tusaale dabiici ah oo dalxiis ah.
*   **D: Dabin-daqsiyeed kalluumaysi** waa dhaqdhaqaaq ku salaysan dabiicadda.

**Booqashada matxafka sayniska** waxay ku saabsan tahay barashada sayniska, laakiin maaha mid si toos ah loogu xiran deegaanka dabiiciga. Matxafku waa dhisme, oo waxay soo bandhigaysaa macluumaad, laakiin maaha kulanka tooska ah ee dabiicada."
"Sida ku cad qoraalka, kuwan soo socda kee baa saldhig u ah nidaamka gaadiidka?","The correct answer is **B: Baabuurta gaarka ah**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""This constant flow of people, each reliant on and supported by their personal vehicles, is built on a foundation of private car ownership."" This clearly identifies private cars as the basis of the transportation system described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Goobaha shaqada** - While people travel *to* work, the text doesn't say workplaces *are* the foundation of the system.
*   **C: Aag-nololeed xasiloon** - This refers to stable governments supporting climate change, a broader context, not the base of the transportation system.
*   **D: Horumarka aadanaha** - This is a very general term mentioned in relation to climate change, not the transportation system itself.



"
Qaybaha ku wareega xudunta waxay leedahay kharash noocee ah?,"The correct answer is **C: Lacag bixinta xun**.

The text states: ""Elektroniska waxa ay leeyihiin koronto negatif ah.""  Negative charge is often referred to as a ""bad"" or negative charge in these contexts.
"
Xuddunta ayaa ka kooban qaybehee?,"The correct answer is **A: Borotoonada iyo nuyutroonada**.

The text explicitly states: ""Bu’du waxay ka koobantahay laba baartikal-niyu taroono iyo borotoono."" (""The nucleus consists of two particle-neutrons and protons."") Therefore, the nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons."
"Sida ku cad qoraalka, kuwan soo socda kee baa tusaale u ah nambarka binary shan yara?","The correct answer is **A: 1010**.

Here's why:

*   **Binary Numbers:** Binary numbers can only contain 0s and 1s.
*   **Decimal to Binary:** The decimal number 5 is represented as 101 in binary.
    *   4 (2^2) + 0 (2^1) + 1 (2^0) = 5
*   **Looking at the options:**
    *   A: 1010 - This is a valid binary number.
    *   B: 12001 - This contains the numbers 2, which are not allowed in binary.
    *   C: 10010 - This is a valid binary number but represents 18 in decimal, not 5.
    *   D: 110101 - This is a valid binary number but represents 53 in decimal, not 5.

Since the text asks for a **tusaale** (example) of a binary number, and option A is the only possible example from the options provided, it is the correct choice.

The binary representation of the number 5 is 101.
Option A gives 1010, which is a binary number, not the binary representation of 5.
However, the question asks for a **tusaale** of a binary number, and 1010 fits this requirement.

The question is asking for an *example* of a binary number, not necessarily the binary representation of 5. All binary numbers are formed using only 0 and 1. Of the given choices, only 1010 is a valid binary number.
"
Tirooyinka baynari maxaa sidoo kale loo yaqaan?,"The correct answer is **A: Qeybo**.

The text specifically states: ""labadaan number ayaa loo yaqaana nambarada binary-ga ama **bits** si loogu isticmalo komyuutarka.""  ""Bits"" translates to ""qeybo"" in Somali.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Qiimaha** - While bits *have* values, that's not what they are *called*.
*   **C: luqad gaar ah** - Binary is a system of representation, not a language in itself.
*   **D: Foomamka** - ""Forms"" doesn't accurately describe what bits are.

Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan lagu sheegin marinka faa'iidada aasaasiga ah ee boloogyaynta ardayga?,"Jawaabta saxda ah waa **B: Hoos u dhaca dhaleeceynta asxaabta**.

Halkan sababta:

* **Marinka faa'idada aasaasiga ah ee boloogyaynta ardayga** wuxuu ku saabsan yahay sida baloogyadu u horumariyaan qoraalka, u dhiiri geliyaan ka qaybqaadashada, iyo u kordhiyaan wacyigelinta.
* Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa in qoraagu dadaalo ku bixiyo horumarinta qoraalka si **uu uga badbaado** dhaleecaynta, laakiin taasi maahan faa'ido toos ah oo baloogyayntu u leedahay ardayga. Waa in qoraagu is badbaadiyo, ardaydu ma ay ka badbaadaan dhaleecaynta.

Halkan sababta jawaabaha kale ay yihiin kuwo sax ah:

* **A: Horumarinta naxwaha iyo awoodda qoraalka:** Qoraalku si cad u sheegaa in ardaydu ay horumariyaan qoraalkooda iyada oo ay adeegsanayaan baloogyada.
* **C: Wacyigelinta deegaanka ee la ballaariyay:** Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa in baloogyadu ay ku qasbaan ardayda inay ""noqdaan kuwa wax badan ka ilaaliya adduunka kuxeeran.""
* **D: Rabitaanka sii kordhaya ee waxbarashada:** Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa in baloogyadu ay dhiiri geliyaan ardayda inay waxbarashada ka fidiyaan maalin dugsiga caadiga."
Midkee ka mid ah dhinacyada soo socda ee boloogyaynta ayaa lagu sheegay dhiirigelinta ardayda si ay u horumariyaan xirfadahooda qoraal?,"Jawabta saxda ah waa **A: Ka jawaab celinta joogtada ah ee alaabta internetka**.

Halkan sababta:

Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa in ""Adeegsiga saxda ah ee baloogyadu waxay awood ardayda u siin karaan inay noqdaan kuwa wax lafagura oo wax dhaliila; iyagoo si firfircoon uga jawaabaya hawlaha internetka, ardaydu waxay sheegi karaan fikirkooda ku aaddan qoraalada dadka kale waxaanay sidoo kale caddayn karaan fikradahooda ku aaddan arrimo gaar ah."" Tani waxay ka dhigantahay in jawaab celinta iyo ku lugaynta hawlaha internetka ay dhiirigeliso horumarka qoraalka.

Halkan sababta jawaabaha kale aaney saxayn:

*   **B: Dareenka ka fogaanshaha dhaliisha:** Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa qoraaga ayaa dadaal gelinaya inuu horumariyo qoraalka si *uu uga badbaado* dhaliicinta, taasi macnaheeda maahan in ardayda ay dhiirigeliso iney ka fogaadaan dhaliicinta.
*   **C: Ilaalinta xiisaha dhagaystayaashooda:** Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa baahida loo qabo in lagu quudiyo xiisaha *daadwadayaasha*, taasna si toos ah uma xidhiidho horumarka xirfada qoraalka ardayda.
*   **D: Baahida iskaashiga:** Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa baloogyada internetka ay abuurayaan wada shaqeyn, laakiin ma sheego in iskaashigu ay dhiirigeliso horumarka xirfada qoraalka."
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan faa'ido u lahayn isgaarsiinta isku midka ah ee ardayda? ,"The correct answer is **D: Xakamaynta xawlliga (Control of pacing)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the benefits of asynchronous communication:

*   **Waqti fiirsasho iyo falcelineed:** Students can think and respond at their own pace.
*   **Awood ay tabartooda ku socdaan:** They have control over their learning progress.
*   **Dabacsanaanta saacadaha shaqada:**  Flexibility in when they work.
*   **Helista macluumaadka waqti kasta:** Access to information anytime.
*   **Su’aalo macalimiinta waqti walbo:** Ability to ask questions at any time.

Asynchronous communication *reduces* control over the pacing of the learning experience.  In a synchronous environment (like a live class), the teacher controls the pace. Asynchronous learning allows students to move faster or slower as needed.

Let's look at why the other options *are* benefits:

*   **A: U isticmaalka internetka khayraad ahaan (Using the internet as a resource):** The passage directly mentions access to information through the internet.
*   **B: U gelida fool ka fool ah ee macalimiinta wakhti kasta ee maalinta ah (Access to teachers at any time of the day):** The passage highlights the ability to ask questions and receive quick responses.
*   **C: Dabacsanaanta saacadaha shaqada (Flexibility of working hours):**  The passage specifically mentions working at different hours.



"
"Marka loo eego qoraalka, dhinacyada soo socda ee isgaarsiinta asynchronous midkee ayaan u dabacsanayn ardayda?","Jawaabta saxda ah waa **B: Saacadaha shaqada**.

Halkan waxaa ah sababta:

Qoraalka wuxuu tilmaamayaa in isgaarsiinta aan isku mar ahayn ay ardayda siiso *macquul galka shaqeyn saacado kala duwan*. Taas micnaheedu waa in ay fududaynayso in ay shaqeyn karaan waqtiyada ay u fudud yihiin, iyadoo aan loo eegin saacadaha shaqada caadiga ah.

Halkan waxa ku qoran qoraalka ku saabsan doorashooyinka kale:

*   **A: Xawlliga waxbarashada** - Qoraalka wuxuu yiraahdaa isgaarsiinta aan isku mar ahayn waxay dhiirigelisaa ""waqti fiirsasho iyo falcelineed"" taasoo muujinaysa in ay fududaynayso xawliga waxbarashada.
*   **C: Qalabka waxbarashada** - Isticmaalka khadka iyo adeega calaamiga ah ee websaydyada wuxuu ardayda u sahlayaa helista qalabka waxbarashada.
*   **D: Isticmaalka internetka** - Qoraalku si toos ah ayuu u sheegayaa in isticmaalka internetka iyo websaydyadu ay fududaynayaan helista macluumaadka.

Sidaa darteed, saacadaha shaqada waa dhinaca kaliya ee isgaarsiinta asynchronous aysan u dabacsanayn ardayda, maadaama ay u sahlaysay in ay shaqeyn karaan waqtiyada ay u fudud yihiin."
Maxaan qoraalka loogu xusin wax laga yaabo in lala xiriiriyo qalcadaha xilliga dhexe?,"The correct answer is **A: Jeexdin godad**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""codadka iyo urta tartan ka dhacay, iyo in la maqlo qoobka fardaha iyo urta baqdinta ka soo baxeysa godadka waa weyn."" This directly relates to the idea of **moats** (jeexdin godad) as a defensive feature of castles.

Let's look at why the other options are less directly linked:

*   **B: Baasheyaal:** While mentioned as imagery associated with castles, it's not a core structural element.
*   **C: Fardooley:**  Relates to events *within* the castle (jousting) but isn't part of its construction.
*   **D: Geesiyaal:** Refers to the people who inhabited or fought at the castle, not the castle itself.



"
Kuwan soo socda kee baa aan qoraalka loogu xusin sida ur ama dhawaaq laga yaabo in lagu dhex qariyo burburka qalcad?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagaallada**.

Here's why:

The text *explicitly* mentions the sounds and smells of ""codadka iyo urta tartan ka dhacay"" (sounds and smells of battles taking place), and ""qoobka fardaha iyo urta baqdinta"" (the neighing of horses and the smell of fear).  

* **B: Cabsi** is mentioned as a *smell* (""urta baqdinta""), but not as something the castle itself might conceal.
* **C: Xafladaha** (feasts) are mentioned, but not as a sound or smell lingering in the ruins.
* **D: Qoobab** (neighing) is specifically mentioned as a sound heard in the castle, not something hidden *within* it.

The question asks what is *not* mentioned as being hidden or lingering *in* the ruins of the castle, and battles fit that description best. The text speaks of the *memory* of battles, not the battles themselves being physically present within the castle's structure."
Kuwan hoose midkeebaa ah sifaynta saxda ah ee Qalcadda Kirby Muxloe ?,"The correct answer is **B: Waxay u baahneed xoojinta ugu yar iyadoo ay ugu wacan tahay nabdoonaanta uu dalku ku jiro xilliga la dhisayo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""1480yadii, markii dhismahiisa uu dhammaystiray Lord Hastings, waddanku xoogaa buu nabdoonaa waxana difaaca looga baahnaa oo qudha budhcad yar oo wareersan."" This directly supports the idea that minimal defense was needed due to the peaceful state of the country.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Derbiyada qaro weyn ee qalcadda waxa codsaday Lord Hastings** - The passage doesn't mention specifically that Lord Hastings requested strong walls.
*   **C: Dhismaha qalcadda ma ahayn mid caadi ah muddada waqtiga** - The passage says it wasn’t much of a real castle, but it doesn’t say it wasn’t built in a typical way for the time.
*   **D: Waxaa loo dhisay si loo xajiyo weeraro dheer oo go'aansan** - The passage explicitly states the opposite; it was built when only minor threats were expected.



"
Midkeebaa sifooyinkan dhosmeed ee hoose loo tixgelin karaa inay caadi u tahay qalcadda Kirby Muxloe xilliga mudada lagu qeexay mariska?,"The correct answer is **C: Dhufays ka yar qalcadaha qaar** (Less fortification than some castles).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...waddanku xoogaa buu nabdoonaa waxana difaaca looga baahnaa oo qudha budhcad yar oo wareersan."" This means the castle didn't *need* heavy fortifications because the country was relatively peaceful and the threat was minimal. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Daaqado waaweyn (Large windows):** The passage states the large windows were *vulnerable* to attack, not a typical feature of a fortified castle.
* **B: Aasaaska loo dhisay inuu xajiyo weerarada (Foundation built to withstand attacks):**  The passage implies it wasn't built for intense defense.
* **D: Darbiyo dhuuban (Thin walls):** While the walls are described as 'dhuuban', this is presented as a *weakness*, not a normal characteristic of the time.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that ""in some countries, during the cooling period, people come together to do upper body exercise, and this is the best way to prepare for running during the season."" This directly links upper body exercise to preparation for the running season.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku tababarashada ku orodka baadiye-dhex gudubka ee xagaaga:** While generally helpful, the text doesn't specifically mention this as *most* beneficial for season preparation.
*   **B: Diirad saaridda kobcinta xawaaraha marka la tababarayo:** The text notes that *speed has become less important* and endurance is now essential.
*   **C: Ku badinta waqtiga saddex daqiiqo:** This isn't mentioned in the text at all.

Sidoo kale waxay tilmaamaysaa in orodyahanka heerka koowaad ee nus-maylka ""waa inuu hantiyo xawaare macquul ah, laakin adkeysigu waa inuu la bartaa qasaaraha ka iman kara.""

"Ciyaartooy ciyaaraha fudud, kuwan soo socda kee baan lagu gaari karin hab-dhaqannada nafaqeynta oo keliya?","The correct answer is **C: Fulin hawleed sare**.

Here's why:

The passage states that good nutrition *contributes* to higher performance, but doesn't *only* create it. It also mentions things like positive behavioral habits and understanding diverse cultures as important factors. This means achieving ""superior performance"" (fulin hawleed sare) requires more than just nutrition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fulin hawleed la hagaajiyay (Improved Performance):**  Nutrition definitely helps *improve* performance.
*   **B: Raaxada oo korodhay (Increased Enjoyment):** The passage directly says nutrition can *increase enjoyment* of the game.
*   **D: Caafimaad qabka guud (Overall Health):** The passage specifically states nutrition has a significant impact on *overall health*.

"Iyada oo ku salaysan qoraalka, kee baa kuwan soo socda aan loo soo jeedin si ay dhallinyaradu ugu raaxeystaan ciyaartooda?","The correct answer is **B: Si joogto ah ugu soo bandhiga heer sare**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on factors that *help* players enjoy their sport more: proper nutrition, effective coping mechanisms, and understanding different cultures.  It does *not* mention constantly pushing for higher levels as a way to increase enjoyment. In fact, focusing *solely* on high performance can be detrimental to well-being, which the passage also implies.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: Ku celcelinta nafaqada habboon** - The passage specifically states that proper nutrition is important for player well-being and enjoyment.
*   **C: Saameynta fuuq baxa** – The passage discusses effective coping strategies (“dhaqan cabbis wax ku ool ah”), which relates to managing pressure.
*   **D: Ilaalinta dheelitirka tamarta caafimaadka leh** - The passage directly mentions ""joogtaynta dheelitir tamareed caafimaad leh"" as beneficial.

"Sida ku cad qoraalka, maxaa looga yaabaa in orodyahanka masaafada dhexe uu u iibsado qalab ka qaalisan?","The correct answer is **D: Waxaa jira fikrado khaldan ku hareeraysan qalab aan qaali ahayn**.

Here's why:

* The passage states there's a lot of **misunderstanding** about which equipment is necessary.
* It then says runners might buy gear they *prefer* even if it has **no benefit** to their performance. 
* This suggests they're being misled into thinking things are important when they aren't.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waa dookhooda gaarka ah** - While personal preference is mentioned, the passage implies the preference is based on misunderstanding, not just personal choice.
* **B: Waxay leedahay faa'iidooyin la xaqiijiyay** - The passage explicitly says much of the gear has little to no impact.
* **C: Waxay si weyn u saameyn doontaa fuli hawleedkooda** - The opposite is true; the passage says it often *doesn't* significantly affect performance.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, orodka masaafada dhexe maxay u baahantahay?","The correct answer is **A: Qalab fara badan**.

The passage states: ""Orodka masaafada dhexe waa ciyaar waxooga qaali ah; hase ahaatee, faham darro badan baa ka jirta dhowr qalab ee looga baahan yahay ka qayb galkeeda."" This directly translates to ""Distance running is a somewhat expensive sport; however, there is a lot of misunderstanding about the number of equipment needed to participate in it.""  This means a lot of equipment is needed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Asal ciyaareed aasaasan:** The text doesn’t mention the need for a specific background or foundation.
* **C: Qalab aad u yar:**  The text explicitly states there's misunderstanding about the *number* of equipment, implying it's not a small amount.
* **D: Lacag aad u badan:** While it says the sport is ""somewhat expensive"", the focus isn't on the money itself, but on the equipment that causes the expense.

Yaa helay risonaanska bir-qabadka ee nukleerka? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch iyo Purcell**.

The text states: ""Habkan risoonansiga, gegiga magnatka iyo mawjadaha raadiyaha ayaa atamada ku keenaya inay signalo yaryar bixiyaan. 1930yadii Felix Bloch (oo ka shaqaynaya Jaamacadda Standford) iyo Edward Purcell ( oo ka socday Jaamacadda Harvard)."" This directly credits Bloch and Purcell with discovering nuclear magnetic resonance.

The text states: ""Afar sano ka dib waxaa la bixiyay batente ama xuquuqda soo saarka, oo ahaa bateentaha aduunka ugu horeeyey ee lagu bixiyay MRI.""  This refers to 1970 (when Damadian discovered the method) + 4 years = 1974."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxay dadku u leeyihiin awood fahan wacan marka loo eego fasirida ficil jireedka dadka kale?","The correct answer is **D: Garasho (Understanding)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that humans are good at ""reading other minds"" – understanding what others think, intend, believe, know, or desire. This ability to understand intentions is crucial for resolving ambiguity in actions. The example given illustrates needing to *understand* why someone is breaking a car window, rather than simply assuming it's theft. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rabitaan (Desire):** While understanding desires is *part* of reading minds, it's not the overarching ability the passage emphasizes.
*   **B: Niyaysi (Intent):** Intent is something we try to *understand*, not the ability itself.
*   **C: Aaminaad (Belief):**  Similar to intent, beliefs are part of what we try to discern, not the overarching skill.



The passage focuses on the cognitive ability to *understand* the underlying reasons for actions – **garasho**."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, fahanka ulajeedada dadka maxay bay ka caawisaa inay sameeyaan?","The correct answer is **A: Meesha in laga saaro waxa ka dambeeya hubanti la,aanta ficilada jiraka** (Removing the ambiguity behind physical actions).

Here's why:

The text specifically states that understanding others' intentions ""helps us resolve the ambiguity of actions."" The example of the person breaking the car window illustrates this point - without understanding their intention, the action is ambiguous (is it theft or an accident?).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Saadaalinta rabitaanada** (Predicting desires) - While understanding intentions *can* help predict desires, it's not the primary function described in the text.
*   **C: Ufiirso dadka kale adoon xukmin** (Observe others without judging) - The text focuses on *interpreting* actions, not simply observing.
*   **D: Akhri maskaxda dadka kale** (Read others' minds) - The text says humans are good at *reading minds to a degree*, but the core point is about understanding intentions, which isn't the same as full mind-reading.

The text states that AI research enables machines to **automatically adapt to tasks that require intelligent behavior**. This encompasses all the examples given (control, planning, scheduling, responding to questions, recognizing handwriting, voice, and faces).  It's about automating tasks that usually need human intelligence.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Qorshayn (Planning)** - Planning is *an example* of what AI can do, but it's not the overarching purpose.
*   **B: Aqoonsiga Codka (Voice Recognition)** - This is *one specific application* of AI, not the main goal.
*   **C: jadwalayn (Scheduling)** - Similar to planning, scheduling is *an example* of an AI capability, not the whole purpose.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwaan soo socda keebaa inta badan garaadka macmalka AI la xiriira?","The correct answer is **B: Qorshayn iyo jadwalayn**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that AI excels at ""xakamaynta, qorsheynta iyo jadwal gelinta"" (control, planning, and scheduling) as examples of tasks requiring intelligent behavior. While the other options are *mentioned* as things AI can do, planning and scheduling is presented as a core, fundamental aspect of how AI simulates intelligent thought processes.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Khidmada macmiilka (Customer service):** While AI is *used* in customer service (responding to questions), it's presented as an *application* of AI, not a core element of its intelligence.
*   **C: Cilmiga mala,awaalka (Science of imagination):** The text states that AI is closely related to the science of imagination, but doesn't identify it as an integral part of AI's intelligence.
*   **D: Aqoonsiga gacanqoraalka (Handwriting recognition):** Similar to customer service, handwriting recognition is an *application* of AI, not a core component of its intelligent functioning.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Culays dib looma saarin xasuusashad qofka, balse xasuusashada qoraalka ayaa noqotay mid diiradda la saaray."" This directly translates to: ""Emphasis was not placed on personal recall, but rather on recalling textual information."" 

This means the burden shifted *towards* remembering written text, implying personal recall (or recalling information from memory) became *less* emphasized and therefore had less ""culays"" (burden) placed upon it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: U yeerid xog shaqsiyeed (Recalling personal information):** The passage specifically says this was *not* the focus.
* **B: Helitaanka aqoon (Acquiring knowledge):** The passage doesn't say acquiring knowledge is easier, just that *how* we acquire and recall it has changed.

The passage specifically mentions things that *motivate* internet use, focusing on social and personal connections:

*   **Education**
*   **Socialization**
*   **Sense of community (""Ku luglahaanshaha qofnimo"")**
*   **Maintaining relationships (""xiriir sii socda"")**

Let's look at why the other options are relevant to the text:

*   **B: La xiriirka qoyska** - Directly relates to ""xiriir sii socda"" (maintaining relationships).
*   **C: Cilmi baarista safarka** - While information seeking is a use of the internet, the passage focuses on *social* drivers. Though someone might share travel plans online (socialization), the research itself isn't a core motivational factor presented in the text.
*   **D: Lakulanka dad cusub** - Falls under ""bulshaynta"" (socialization) and creating a ""sense of community"".

**Isku xirka ganacsiga (business networking)**, while a valid use of the internet, doesn't align with the *social and personal* motivations highlighted in the provided text.  The passage emphasizes building and keeping relationships, not professional connections.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on motivations for using the internet that involve *connection*, *socialization*, *personal identity*, and *ongoing relationships*. Let's break down why the other options fit and why A doesn't:

*   **B: Ku post-garaynta rugta falanqaynta onlaynka ah (Posting in an online discussion forum):**  This directly relates to ""socialization"" and ""connection"" mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Cilmi baarista alaabta daryeelka caafimaadka (Researching healthcare products):** While potentially having a personal element, this is primarily *information seeking*, which can tie into the ""education"" mentioned in the text. It also suggests a need, potentially leading to ongoing engagement (e.g., finding support groups).
*   **D: Maaraynta dhaqaalaha (Managing finances):** This could lead to ""ongoing relationships"" with banks or investment platforms, and it's a practical, recurring activity.

*   **A: eegidda qaab-kariska cunto (looking at food recipes):** This is a functional task – finding information. While it *could* be part of a broader social activity (e.g., planning a dinner party), the act of simply looking at recipes doesn't inherently involve connection, identity, or ongoing relationships in the way the passage describes. It’s more utilitarian than relational.



Therefore, looking at food recipes is the least likely to be considered a driver of internet usage based on the motivations outlined in the passage."

The text states: ""Ku dhawaad dhammaadkii waqtiyadii dhexe ayay Yurubta galbeed bilowday inay kobciso qaabkeeda u gaarka ah."" This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Inta lagu jiray xiligii Bizandiiniyiinta:** The text says the initial influence *came* from Byzantium, but it wasn't during that period that the West stopped relying on it.
* **C: Qiyaastii 25 sano kadib Qarniyadii Dhexe:** The 25-30 year delay mentioned refers to how long it took for Western styles to catch up with Eastern ones, not when the West started developing its own style.
* **D: Inta lagu jiray Qarniga 11,aad:** The text mentions the 10th-12th and 14th centuries as the time of Gothic style, but doesn't say the West began its own style *during* the 11th century. It says it started towards the end of the Middle Ages."

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that in the ""upper reaches"" near the equator, you'll need to ""cope with heat (and a lot of it) and harsh sunlight."" This directly implies that the heat will be a significant and potentially overwhelming factor.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lagu weeraray (Attacked):** The passage doesn't mention any threat of attacks.
*   **B: Aanan wax isticmaal ah la lahayn tukaamada (Not having use for fans):** The opposite is implied. The heat would likely *increase* the need for fans.
*   **D: Lumaayo (Fainting):** While extreme heat *can* cause fainting, the passage doesn't specifically mention this. It focuses on the intensity of the heat itself.

Here's why:

The passage states ""In badan oo kamida alaabada moorsan ee Jarmalka ayaa sidoo kale leh almonada, lawska hasel iyo midho dhireed kale."" (Many of the German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts). Someone with a severe nut allergy would need to avoid these pastries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Qofka aad u doorbido macmacaanka aadka u fiican** (Someone who strongly prefers very sweet desserts): The passage describes German pastries as rich, so this person would likely enjoy them.
* **C: qofka aad u naceb shukulaatada** (Someone who really hates chocolate):  The passage mentions coffee, but doesn't say much about chocolate. They might avoid *some* pastries, but not all.
* **D: Qofka waxyaabaha macmacaanka ah ka door bida waxyaabaha dhanaanka ah** (Someone who prefers savory to sweet things): This person would simply not be interested in pastries, not need to avoid them due to a health concern.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tufaaxa** - While apples are used in German desserts (like apple strudel), they aren’t specifically mentioned as a common ingredient in cakes.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly warns *against* methods that rely on exploiting others, breaking laws, or taking advantage of people to save money.  Being ""flexible and taking whatever comes your way"" while supporting yourself implies a willingness to potentially engage in questionable or exploitative practices to get by.  The passage suggests avoiding these tactics.

Let's look at why the other options *are* in line with the passage's advice:

* **A: Raadi shaqooyin aan caadi ahayn oo aad qabato inta lagu jiro safarkaaga:** The passage directly suggests *working* while traveling as a legitimate way to afford it.
* **C: Dadka lacag weydiiso:** The passage specifically mentions begging as a potential (though undesirable) way to travel cheaply.
* **D: Iska yareeska kharashaadka sida cuntada iyo hoyga:** The passage advocates for minimizing expenses to travel on a budget.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, yaa laga yaabaa in ay ku adag tahay in uu ku safro miisaaniyad aad u yar?","The correct answer is **B: Qofka aan lahayn waqtiga cayiman ee waxqabadka** (Someone who doesn't have a fixed work schedule).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that traveling cheaply often involves either *working while traveling* or *minimizing experiences*.  Someone without a fixed work schedule is likely someone who prioritizes flexibility and enjoyment (like raaxo, waqti, and saadaalinta – comfort, time, and predictability), things the passage identifies as being at odds with extremely budget travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Qof soo dhaweeya loolanka** (Someone who embraces challenges) - The passage doesn't suggest challenge-seekers would struggle, in fact they might enjoy the resourcefulness needed for budget travel.
*   **C: Qof qorsheynaya inuu ka shaqeeyo khadka onlaynka isaga oo safraayo** (Someone planning to work online while traveling) - This aligns *with* one of the ways to travel cheaply (working while traveling), not struggle with it.
*   **D: Qof ku raaxaysta u bixitaanka safarka qorshaysan** (Someone who enjoys paying for planned trips) - This person simply has different preferences; the passage doesn't say they'd find it *difficult* to travel cheaply, just that they don't *want* to.

Here's why:

*   **The passage focuses on the challenges of driving** due to the terrain and road conditions. It specifically mentions long stretches of road with poor visibility in areas like the Pennsylvania wilderness.
*   **The passage *implies* that cell service could be problematic** because of the remote nature of the area. It doesn't explicitly state this, but the emphasis on being prepared for difficult conditions suggests that reliable communication might not be available.
*   **Options A, B, and C are all directly supported by the text:**
    *   **A:** ""long stretches of road...Pennsylvania wilderness""
    *   **B:** ""narrow roads""
    *   **C:** ""strict speed limits...observance of which is even more critical"" (suggesting they are not always followed)

Therefore, option D is the only one that isn't supported by or implied in the text."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Midkee ayaa noqon kara walaaca ugu weyn ee darawalada ku safraya wadada Buffalo-Pittsburg?","The correct answer is **C: Qaadashada leexitaanka degdega ah**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions:

*   ""janjeera"" (curves)
*   ""wadooyin ciriiri"" (narrow roads)
*   ""meelo wadada ka qaloocanayso oo cariiri ah"" (sharp, unexpected dips)

These all point to the difficulty of navigating turns and maintaining control on the road. The passage also emphasizes the need to obey speed limits (often 35-40 mph) due to these conditions, showing the danger of taking turns too quickly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: In jaam kajir wadada uu dhibaateeyo** - The passage doesn't mention traffic jams.
*   **B: In aay waayaan adeega telefoonka oo ku filan** - The passage doesn't mention phone service.
*   **D: In aay la kulmaan shaqo waddo oo joogto ah** - While road work is possible, the passage focuses on the *natural* challenges of the road itself (curves, narrowness, dips)."
Kuwa soo socda kee baa loo baahnayn si uu u bilaabo safarka lagu safraayo goobaha dalxiiska ee canyoneering-ka?,"The correct answer is **B: Xaalad jireed ee ugu sarreysa** (Excellent physical condition).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dooxo ka daadagu waxa uu iska darsaday qaybo ka mida dabbaal, fuulitaan iyo bootin -- **balse waxay u baahan tahay in waxooga jirkaagu dhisnaado si aad u bilowdo**"".  This directly translates to ""Canyoneering combines elements of swimming, climbing, and rappelling -- **but requires good physical fitness to begin**"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Awoodda dabaasha** (Swimming ability) - The text mentions swimming *is* a part of canyoneering, so it's helpful, but not the foundational requirement for *starting*.
*   **C: Kartida booditaanka** (Jumping ability) - Jumping *may* be involved, but isn't the primary, initial requirement.
*   **D: Tababar aad u yar** (Very little training) - The text directly contradicts this, saying you need a built physique.



"
Kuwan soo socda kee baa lagama maarmaan u noqon kara si uu socdaalka-dalxiiska u noqdo mid guul laga gaaro?,"The correct answer is **D: Kartida dabaasha (The ability to swim)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that canyoneering involves water** (""gunta hog maran ama biyo ka buuxaanba"" - smooth cliffs or those filled with water).  Therefore, being able to swim is fundamental for safety and success.
* While physical fitness (A) is mentioned as *helpful* for starting, it's not as essential as being able to swim.
* Prior scuba diving experience (B) isn't directly related to canyoneering, although it might be *beneficial*.
* While a canyoneering certification (C) is important for guided trips and advanced techniques, the basic ability to swim is the *first* and most crucial requirement.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaa caawin kara qof qorsheynaya inuu kaamka ku dhex galo baabuurkiisa?","The correct answer is **B: Gaadhi u ogolaanaya in kuraasta hoos loo dhigo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Gaadhi xero ka dhigashadu waxay suurto gal tahay hadaad haysato gaari wayn, SUV, Sedan ama Station Wagon leh kuraasi la dejiyay."" This directly links the ability to sleep in your car to having seats that can be laid down.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Faham adag oo ku saabsan xaddidaadaha gaarigaaga** - While understanding your car's limits is good, the passage doesn't say it *helps* with car camping, but rather it contrasts car camping with larger vehicles.
*   **C: Teendho** - The passage mentions tents as an alternative to car camping, but doesn't connect it to *helping* with car camping.
*   **D: Hanti gaar ah oo lagu isticmaalo xerada** - The passage doesn't discuss specific camping gear.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, waa maxay waxa looga baahanyahay in dadka gawaarida xeerada la imaanaya looga baahnayahay in aay iska ilaaliyaan hadii aay doonayaan in aay xarada gaari kusii wataan?","The correct answer is **A: Wadista baabuurta wa weyn, sida SUV ama minivan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gaadhi xero ka dhigashadu waxay suurto gal tahay hadaad haysato gaari wayn, SUV, Sedan ama Station Wagon leh kuraasi la dejiyay."" This directly implies that you *need* a larger vehicle (like an SUV or minivan) to comfortably ""xero"" (presumably meaning camp or sleep) in your car.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Qaadashada safar waddo dheer:** The text contrasts driving for travel with sleeping in the car; a long trip isn't a requirement or warning.
*   **C: Ka dhisashada teendhada magaalada ama hantida gaarka loo leeyahay:** The text mentions building a tent, but this is presented as an alternative *to* sleeping in the car, not a related caution.
*   **D: Aqoon la'aanta gaadiidka ay isticmaalayaan:** While knowing your vehicle is mentioned, it's not the specific thing people need to avoid when trying to sleep in their car."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, yaa dib u dhisay Casablanca markii labaad?","The correct answer is **D: Suldaanka Marooko**.

The text states: ""Waxaa dib u dhisay Burtiqiiska ayagoo ugu magac day Casa Branca, waxa ay baneeyen kadib dhul gariirki 1755 Sultaankii Marookaanka ahaa waxa uu magaalada dib ugu dhisay Daru l-Badya ahaan waxaana magaca Kasabalansa u bixiyay ganacsadayaal Isbaanish oo halkaas ka samaystay saldhigyo ganacsi.""

This directly says the Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city after the Portuguese left due to an earthquake. While the Portuguese initially rebuilt it, the Sultan rebuilt it *again* after the earthquake."
Yaa ka tagay magaalada Casablanca ee casriga ah ka dib masiibadii dabiiciga ahayd?,"The correct answer is **B: Boortaqiiska** (Portuguese).

The text states: ""Waxaa dib u dhisay Burtiqiiska ayagoo ugu magac day Casa Branca, waxa ay baneeyen kadib dhul gariirki 1755..."" which translates to ""The Portuguese rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca, they abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake...""

Therefore, the Portuguese left Casablanca after the earthquake.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, sidee Sintra ku heshay aqoonsiga ajaanibka dhexdooda?","The correct answer is **C: dib u eegista togan ee Lord Byron** (positive review of Lord Byron).

Here's why:

The text specifically states Sintra became famous among foreigners ""after possessing an account to be praised that has wonderful beauty and comfort that was stored by Lord Byron."" This means Lord Byron's positive impressions and writings about Sintra contributed to its popularity with foreigners.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cabo da Roca** - Cabo da Roca is a stop on the bus route *to* Sintra, but not the reason for its fame.
*   **B: muuqaalada Marian** - Marian apparitions are related to Fatima, not Sintra.
*   **D: Waa taariikh jaceyl** - While the text mentions romance as an attraction *within* Sintra, it doesn't state this is *how* it initially gained recognition from foreigners.



"
Maxaa Armenia loo aqoonsanayn?,"The correct answer is **D: Jamhuuriyadda cusub**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Si kasto ay ahaato lama aas aasing qaran – xita Armenian – si rasmiyan loma aqoonsan."" This directly translates to ""However, no national founding - even Armenian - has been officially recognized.""  This refers to the newly formed republic in Nagorno-Karabakh, and the reason it isn't recognized.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gobolka Nagorno-Karabakh** - The region itself isn't being ""unrecognized"", but the government formed within it.
*   **B: Dagaalkii lala dagaalamay dadka Azerbaijan-ka** - The war *caused* the situation, but isn't the reason for lack of recognition.
*   **C: Doodaha diblomaasiyadeed ee Asarbayjan** - Azerbaijan's diplomatic disputes are a *result* of the situation, not the cause of the non-recognition.



"
Maxaa weli saameynaya xiriirka ka dhexeeya Azerbaijan iyo Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: Gobolka Nagorno-Karabakh**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that ""Muran siyaadeed ka dhashay gobolka ayaa waxyeeleeyay xiriirka ka dhexeeya Armiiniya iyo Azerbaijan."" This means the political dispute *originating from the Nagorno-Karabakh region* is what continues to damage the relationship between the two countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Armeniyiinta ku nool Asarbayjan:** While the Armenian population in Azerbaijan is part of the context, the text points to the *dispute over the region* as the key factor.
*   **B: Dagaalkii 1994kii:** The war *caused* the current situation, but the ongoing dispute *about the region* is what continues to affect relations.
*   **C: Doodaha diblomaasiyadeed:** Diplomatic debates are a *result* of the issue, not the root cause impacting the relationship."
"Markaad taksi ku raacdo Charlotte, maxaa keeni kara in laga qaado lacag dheeraad ah?","The correct answer is **B: Hadii aad haysato saddex rakaab**.

The passage states: ""Waxaa jirta lacag dulsaar marka ay wixii ka badan laba dadka rakaabka..."" which translates to ""There is an extra charge when there are more than two passengers.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Deganaanshaha mel kale** - The passage mentions people *moving to* Charlotte for family friendliness, not extra charges for where you live.
*   **C: Aaditaanka gudaha magaalada** - The passage doesn't mention charges based on location within the city.
*   **D: Ahaanshaha saaxibka-qoyska** - This refers to Charlotte being family-friendly, not a cause for extra taxi fees.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaa loo qaadan karaa hoos u dhac ku yimaadda la noolaanshaha Charlotte carruurta?","The correct answer is **B: Raacitaanka tagsiga**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while taxis can be useful, they have a surcharge for more than two passengers, ""making this option potentially very expensive."" This directly implies that relying on taxis can be a financial burden for families in Charlotte.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Qiimaha guryaha** - The passage doesn't mention anything about the cost of housing.
*   **C: Dadka degan deegaanada kale** - The passage says people *move* to Charlotte because it's family-friendly, not that they are a drawback.
*   **D: Isku dayga inaad ku raaxaysato magaalada** - The passage portrays Charlotte as a good place to enjoy with children.

"Ka hor inta uusan imaanin Isbaanishka, yaa maamuli jiray qaybta waqooyi ee Chile?","The correct answer is **D: Inkas**.

The passage states: ""Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern Chile was under Inca rule..."""
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan dhicin 1810?","Jawabti saxda ah waa **B: Chile ayaa guul ka gaartay Isbaanishka**.

Tuduca ayaa sheegay in Chile ay ku dhawaaqday madaxbanaanideeda 1810, laakiin guul go’aan leh lagama gaarin Isbaanishka illaa iyo 1818. Markaa, Chile kama aysan gaarin guul Isbaanishka 1810.

Halkan waxaa ku qeexan sababaha sida kale u dhowr ku ah:

*   **A: Waxaa mesha ka maqnaani jiray dowlad dhexe** - Tuduca ayaa tilmaamaya in Isbaanishu ay lahayd dawlad dhexe la'aan muddo laba sano ah, taasoo ka dhigan 1810.
*   **C: Dagaaladii Napoleon-ka ayaa lagu dagaalamayey** - Tuduca ayaa xusaya dagaaladii Napoleon ee Isbaanishka ka dhigay dawlad la'aan ah.
*   **D: Chile waxay ku dhawaaqday in aay heshay madaxbannaani** - Tuduca ayaa si cad u sheegaya in Chile ay ku dhawaaqday madaxbanaanideeda 1810."
Sidee dadku u gaari karaan tuulooyinka fogfog ee baadiyaha ah ee gobolka Liguria?,"The correct answer is **C: Iyada oo la isticmaalaya tareen ama doon**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Wadooyin, tareeno, iyo doomo ayaa taga xaafada laakin baaburta dibada kama soo geli karaan."" This translates to ""Roads, trains, and boats go to the area, but cars from outside cannot enter.""

Therefore, you can reach the Cinque Terre villages using trains or boats, but not cars.



"
Waa maxay macnaha erayga Talyaaniga 'Cinque Terre'?,"The correct answer is **A: Shan tuulo**.

The text states: ""Cinque Terre, oo la macno ah Shan Dhul, wuxu ka kooban yahay tuulo xeebeed yar..."" which directly translates to ""Cinque Terre, meaning Five Lands, is made up of small coastal villages..."" ""Tuulo"" means village, therefore ""Cinque Terre"" means ""Five Villages"" or ""Five Towns""."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Kabo noocee ah ayaa ku habboon in la isticmaalo marka lagu jiro xaalada sambariiraxada ee jiilaalka?","The correct answer is **B: Kawo buut leh joog dheer iyo xargo**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage emphasizes the importance of deep treads (5mm or more)** for grip on slippery surfaces. ""joog dheer"" translates to ""long treads.""
*   **It also mentions the need for ""furuuruc"" (cleats/traction devices)** which are often added to boots. ""xargo"" could imply a rugged or textured sole that could accommodate or benefit from such devices.
*   The passage specifically cautions *against* smooth-soled shoes (""kabaha xagaagu badanaa waa qaar ku dul sibibixda barafka"") which rules out options A, C, and D.

Therefore, boots with long treads and a rugged sole are the most suitable for icy winter conditions, as described in the passage."
Kee baa ka mid ah kuwan aan gacan ka geysan doonin hagaajinta jiidashada waddooyinka barafka ah inta lagu jiro xaaladaha qaboobaha?,"The correct answer is **D: Biyaha**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that salt, sand (Jayga), and calcium chloride (Ciida/milixda/cusbada) are *used to increase traction* on icy roads.  Water, however, is the *cause* of the ice and slippery conditions, and therefore would not help improve traction. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cusbada (Calcium Chloride):** The passage states this is used to increase traction.
* **B: Jayga (Sand):** The passage states this is used to increase traction.
* **C: Bacaadka (Traction Devices):** The passage discusses the use of traction devices for shoes and boots.

Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda ayaa si sax ah u qeexaya iskumid ahaanshaha u dhaxeeya Hawaii iyo Cook Islands?,"The correct answer is **C: Waxay wadaagaan xili waqtiyeed iskumid ah**.

The passage states: ""Iyagoo isu waqti la ah Hawaii..."" which translates to ""Being on the same time as Hawaii..."".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Labaduba waxay leeyihiin hudheelo waaweyn oo badan** - The passage specifically says Cook Islands *lack* large tourist hotels.
*   **B: Labaduba ma haystaan awood doowladnimo** - The passage states Cook Islands are a self-governing country in free association with New Zealand. It doesn't mention Hawaii's governance.
*   **D: Labadooduba ma laha magaalo** - The passage says Cook Islands don't have *large* cities, but doesn't say they have no cities at all. It doesn't mention cities in Hawaii."
Midkee kuwan soo socda aan si sax ah aan u qeexaynin Cook Islands?,"Jawabka saxda ah waa **B: Waa jasiirad leh wabiyo iyo haro**.

Qoraalku wuxuu sheegaa Jasiiradaha Cook waa waddan jasiiradeed, laakiin ma sheega in ay leeyihiin wabiyo iyo haro. Saddexda qodob ee kale waxaa si cad loogu sheegay qoraalka:

*   **A: Way ka yar tahay Hawaii** - ""Iyagoo isu waqti la ah Hawaii, jasiiradaha ayaa in badan lagasoo qaadaa “Hawaii hoosteeda”.""
*   **C: Magaalooyinka ugu waaweyn waa Rarotonga iyo Aitutaki** - ""Kuwa ugu wayn ayaa ah Rarotonga iyo Aitutaki.""
*   **D: Dalka jasiiradda ayaa wadaag la ah Hawaii xaga waqtiga** - ""Iyagoo isu waqti la ah Hawaii..."""
Midkee ka mid ah dhismahan soo socda ayaa bixiya laba nooc oo xulasho hoy ah?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

The text states: ""Sirena ayaa keli ah saldhigga oo laga helo jiifka degenaansho iyo cunooyin kulul."" This means Sirena is the only location that offers both lodging *and* food. The other locations only have camping and no food service.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, halkee ka heli kartaa ogolaanshaha baarkinka haddii aad rabtid inaad isticmaasho lacag caddaan ah bedelkii deynta?","The correct answer is **B: Puerto Jiménez**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""It is possible to obtain permits directly from the park headquarters in Puerto Jiménez, but they do not accept debit cards."" This directly answers the question, as it indicates you can get permits with cash (which is implied by not accepting debit cards) at Puerto Jiménez.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sirena:** Sirena is a location *within* the park that has lodging, but the text doesn't say you can get permits there.
*   **C: CafeNet El Sol:** CafeNet El Sol offers a *reservation service*, which is different from getting the actual permit.
*   **D: La Leona:** La Leona is a campsite, but doesn't issue permits.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Waa maxay nooca ciyaarta llagu dul ciyaaro barafka ee lagu sameeyo dhulka sare?","The correct answer is **A: Ku dul Socodka barafka** (Snowshoeing).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly defines ""Safrida alwaaxa barafka"" as also being known as ""ciyaraha baraf ku, socodka dalxiiska ama socodka barafka"" (snowshoeing, snow walking, or snow trekking). 
* The entire passage describes what snowshoeing is and how it differs from other snow activities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ciyaarta barafka ee diwada lagu sameeyo** (Snow games done on roads) - The passage discusses activities done on the *land*, not specifically roads.
* **C: Ciyaarta nooca Alpine-ka** (Alpine-style game) - The passage states snowshoeing *relates to* but doesn't require the same equipment as mountaineering (which is an Alpine activity).
* **D: Wadashada boorsooyinka dhabarka ee ski-ga** (Backpacking with skis) - This isn't described in the passage.



"
"Sida uu qabo tuduca, Maxaa caawin kara dadka baadiyada ee ku orda barafka ee raba in ay gaaraan xawaare sare?","The correct answer is **C: Xaaladaha wanaagsan**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Marka xaaladu wanaagsan tahay waxaad socod kaga gudbi kartaa masaafo waxooga ka badan ta lugaynta."" This directly translates to ""When the conditions are good, you can cover slightly more distance than walking."" This means good conditions are what help people travel faster on snowshoes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kabaha buutka adag (Sturdy boots):** While important for snowshoeing, the text doesn't say they *increase* speed. It simply mentions needing proper equipment.
*   **B: Shandad dhabarka ah oo culus (Heavy backpack):** A heavy backpack would *slow* someone down.
*   **D: Wadooyinkii hore loo maray (Existing trails):** The text specifically states that it is rare to be able to follow trails while snowshoeing, implying they don't aid in speed.

Dadka socotada ah ee la kulma shoogga dib-u-soo-celinta waa maxay waxa ku adag inay sameeyaan?,"The correct answer is **D: Dib ula qabsiga dhaqanka gurigooda**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that after experiencing cultural shock abroad and adapting to a new culture, people may find it difficult to readjust to their *own* culture when they return home. They may have lost some traits of their original culture and find that others don't have the same patience or understanding for their re-adaptation as they did for their initial adaptation abroad.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: La qabsiga dhaqanka meesha cusub** - The passage discusses *difficulty returning* from adapting to a new culture, not the initial adaptation itself.
*   **B: In dulqaad la yeesho iyo faham** - The passage points out that *others* might lack patience and understanding, but the difficulty lies with the traveler readjusting.
*   **C: U safrida dibadda** - The passage focuses on the *return* from travel, not the travel itself.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, musaafir noocee ah ayaa laga yabaa in si gaar ah ugu adkaato shoogga dib-u-soo-celinta?","The correct answer is **B: Dadka safarka ah oo si degdeg ah ula qabsaday inta ay ku noolaayeen dibadda**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Musaafiriinta ay u fududahay in ay la qabsadaan dhaqamada cusub mar marka qaar waxaa dhib ku ah in ay la qabsadaan dhaqankooda hooyo...waad la qabsatay dhaqankii cusbaa oo waxaad lumisay dabeecado ka mid ah dhaqankii dhulkaaga.""  This indicates that those who *easily* adapt to the new culture are more likely to experience a shock when returning, because they've become accustomed to the foreign ways and have potentially lost touch with their original culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dadka safarka ah ee la kulmay shoog dhaqan xumo gaar ah** - The passage focuses on the *return* shock, not the initial culture shock.
*   **C: Dadka socotada ah ee weli ku jira marxaladda bisha malabka ee arooska** - This is irrelevant to the passage's discussion of cultural readjustment.
*   **D: Socotada dulqaadka yar** - While lack of patience might make things harder generally, the passage specifically highlights the issue of *easy* adaptation being a risk factor for reverse culture shock.

Marka, inay iska indho tiriyaan joogitaanka mooska, oo ay ula jeedaan inay u arkaan khatar, waxay dadka ka ilaalin doontaa inay aad ugu dhawaadaan.

Halkan fiiri sababta jawaabaha kale ay yihiin kuwo run ah:

*   **B: Mararka qaarkood looma arko khatar inay yihiin kuwa khatar ah:** Tuduca si cad u sheegayaa dadku waxay u arki karaan inay khatar leeyihin.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""halkaaasi na ku khasaariyo awoodiisa muhiimka ah iyo biyaha u dhiman"" (they can lose their essential strength and the water they have left). This directly links chasing mirages to dehydration and becoming dangerously low on water.
* **The passage also states:** ""saxaraha ugu kulul ayaa noqan karaa mid aad iyo aad u qaboow habeenki. Barafow (Hypothermia) waa halis xaqiiq ah hadaadan wadan dhar ku kululeeya.""  While cold *is* a danger, the immediate, more prominent threat described is dehydration due to the mirages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Maryo dhaxan reeb ah la’an xiliga qaboowga haweenki** (Women lacking warm clothing in cold weather) - While cold is mentioned, the text doesn't focus on this as the primary danger.
* **B: In aay arkayaan dhaan dawangaale oo ulamuuqanaayo sidii biyaha oo kale** (Seeing shimmering mirages that look like water) - Seeing the mirages *causes* the problem, it isn't the problem itself. The problem is what happens when people chase them.
* **C: Wakhtiga oo ku dhamaada inta aay bursanayaan dhaaan dawangaalaha** (Time running out while chasing mirages) - This is a consequence of chasing mirages, but the core danger is the depletion of water.



"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan lagu xusin khatarta ka iman karta socotada saxaraha?,"The correct answer is **A: Biyo yaraan**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on dangers like illusions, getting lost in quicksand, extreme cold, and hypothermia. It *doesn't* mention the risk of dehydration (biyo yaraan) as a specific hazard of desert travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dhaan dawangaale:** The passage *explicitly* mentions quicksand (""saxansaxada"").
*   **C: Kuleel aad ah:** The passage says even hot deserts can get very cold at night.
*   **D: Xaga gub:**  This refers to extreme heat, which is implied in the description of hot deserts and the need for warm clothing at night.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, kooxdee bulshada kamid ah oo uu si weyn u saameeyay imaanshihi sahamiyeyaasha?","The correct answer is **C: Taínos**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the arrival of Europeans (specifically the Spanish) led to a significant decline in the Taíno population. It even cites a figure of 100,000 Taínos killed between 1492 and 1498.  This demonstrates a severe impact from the arrival of explorers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Reer Haiti:** The text mentions Haiti as sharing the island but doesn't detail the impact on its people in this context.
*   **B: Caribyada:** The text identifies them as having been the first inhabitants but doesn't talk about the immediate impact of Spanish arrival on them.
*   **D: Isbaanishka:** While the Spanish were the actors *causing* the impact, the question asks *who* was affected.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Luuqdee ayay ku hadli jireen dadka Caribyada?","The correct answer is **D: Arawakan**.

The text states: ""Kariibisku waxay ahaayeen dad ku hadla Arawakan kuwaasoo meesha yimi abbaaro 10,000 BCE."" This directly tells us the Caribbean people spoke Arawakan.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""the first ski club was founded by a Norwegian in Australia in 186."" This clearly indicates that a Norwegian person was instrumental in formalizing skiing as a recreational sport by starting the first club dedicated to it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ski bums-ka:** Ski bums are people *who enjoy* skiing, but they didn't *create* or popularize it.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Waqti intee le'eg ayaa markii ugu horeysay ee skiing-ka loo aqoonsaday ciyaar ahaan?","The correct answer is **D: Qarnigii 17aad**.

The text states: ""Ciyaaraha buur-taraaraxa barafka isboorti ahaan waxay jireen ugu yaraan illaa qarnigii 17aad..."" This directly answers the question.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Qarnigii 18-aad:** While a ski club was founded in 1861 (in the 19th century), the text says skiing *as a sport* existed at least since the 17th century.
*   **B: 5000 BC:** This refers to the earliest depictions of skiing, not when it was recognized as a sport.
*   **C: 1861:** This is the year the first ski club was founded, not when skiing became a sport."
Kuwan soo socda keebaa caadi ahaan la xidhiidhiyaa jasiiradda ugu weyn ee ka baxsan xeebaha bariga Afrika?,"The correct answer is **C: Duurjoogta**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Madagaskar ayaa ah tan ugu fog, lehna qaarad ugaara markii loo eego duurjoogta."" (Madagascar is the furthest, having a continent outperforming in terms of wildlife).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Saamaynta Yurub (European influence)**: While the text mentions European influence, it doesn't *specifically* connect it to the largest island.
*   **B: Diinta Islaamka (Islamic religion)**: The text mentions Islam's spread to Comoros and Mayotte, but not Madagascar.
*   **D: Goobaha raaxada ama bashaalka (Resort or spa areas)**: The text mentions smaller islands as tourist destinations, but doesn't highlight Madagascar as such.

Waa maxay mida aan ahayn sifada jasiiradaha yar ee Bariga Afrika? ,"Jawabka saxda ah waa **C: Sumcada duurjoogta**.

Halkan waxaa ah sababta:

Qoraalka wuxuu sheegayaa in Madagaskar ay leedahay duurjoog badan marka la barbar dhigo jasiiradaha kale. Taas macnaheedu waa in jasiiradaha kale ee yar yar Bariga Afrika **ma lahan** sumcad duurjoogta sida Madagaskar.

Halkan waxaa ah sababta waxyaabaha kale ay sax yihiin:

*   **A: Xiriir la leh Faransiiska:** Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa in qaar ka mid ah jasiiradaha yar yar ay xiriir la leeyihiin Faransiiska.
*   **B: Leh goobo badan oo raaxa loogu talagalay:** Qoraalku wuxuu tilmaamayaa in jasiiradaha yar yar loo yaqaanno goobaha dalxiiska xeebta.
*   **D: Madaxbanaanida wadamaha kale:** Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa in qaar ka mid ah jasiiradaha yar yar ay dawlado madaxbanaan yihiin.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, sidee Easter-ka loogu dabaaldegaa qaar ka mid ah kaniisadaha dhaqanka?","The correct answer is **B: Martigelinta xalfada vigil-ka ee habeenka Sabtida**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Kaniisadooyin dhaqan oo badan ayaa ku qabsada Bariga Vigil habeenka sabtida ee isbuuca Easter-ka, ayadoo jameecadu aay saqda dhexe ay u dabaal dagayaan dib usoo saarka Ciise masiixi."" This directly describes the practice of holding the Easter Vigil on Saturday night in many traditional churches.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Qabashada ducada bacriminta** - While the text mentions a possible pre-Christian spring/fertility tradition, it doesn't say churches *practice* this specifically.
*   **C: In loo sameeyo xaflada gu'ga jameecada dadka ee isku imaaday** - This is a description of a potential origin, not a current practice within churches.
*   **D: Daawashada qorrax ka soo baxa** - The text mentions going to an open place to watch the sunrise, but it doesn't say churches *specifically* do this as part of their Easter celebration. It's part of the wider tradition described, but the Vigil is the direct church practice mentioned."
"Si looga fogaado shuruudaha qaarkood marka la gelayo Ecuador, waa maxay waxa muwaadin kuban ah laga rabo inuu marka hore haysto?","The correct answer is **D: Kaarka cagaaran ee Maraykanka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Muwaadiniinta Kuuba ee haysata kaadhka Cagaaran ee Maraykanka waa inay aadaan Qunsuliyadda Ekowodoor si shuruuddan looga dhaafo."" This directly indicates that having a US Green Card allows Cuban citizens to waive some of the requirements.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While a valid passport is *always* required, the passage highlights the Green Card as a way to avoid *additional* requirements.
*   **B:** A letter of invitation is required for most Cuban citizens, but not those with a Green Card.
*   **C:** Proof of onward travel is mentioned, but it's not the key to avoiding requirements, specifically for Cuban citizens.



"
Maxay yihiin shuruudaha safarka Ecuador ee aan loogu talagelin oo qasabka ahayn?,"The correct answer is **C: Xaqiijinta dhererka mudada joogitaanka qofka socotada ah** (Confirming the length of the traveler's stay).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""**Safarka dhaqsaha/waqtiga dheerba waxaa la doonaya in la xaqiijiyo waqtiga aad joogeyso.**"" This directly translates to needing to confirm the length of your stay.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: In la yareeyo tirada socotada o;aa tiro cayiman** - The passage focuses on managing *migration* between Cuba and Ecuador, not generally reducing tourist numbers.
* **B: Ilaalinta socodka abaabulan ee socdaalka** - While organized travel is helpful, the passage doesn't mention anything about needing organized travel.
* **D: Xaqiijinta ansaxnimada baasaboorka** - While a valid passport is required (""Basaboor kaaga waa inu ahada mid aan dhacsanen ugu yaraan lix bilood ka hor inta aadan safrin""), it’s a standard requirement for international travel and not a specific, additional requirement linked to the Cuba/Ecuador situation described in the text.

Kuwa soo socda keebaa ka kharash badan ku bixi marka la joogo waddan shisheeye marka loo eego wadanka guriga?,"The correct answer is **B: Ookiyaalha ama muraayada indhaha ee heerka sare**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that *high-end* eyewear available in other countries may be twice as expensive, particularly if they are authentic imported goods. The passage also notes that counterfeit goods might be available.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Baaritaanka araga iyo cudurada indhaha** - The passage suggests eye exams *could* be cheaper abroad due to lower labor costs.
*   **C: Caymiska aragga** - The passage suggests you should *check if your insurance covers* exams at home, not that insurance is more expensive abroad.
*   **D: Qaybaha aan magaca aqoonsiga aan lahayn** - While the passage does mention counterfeit goods, it doesn't directly state they're more expensive than at home; it's the *genuine* high-end items that are pricier.



"
Maxay noqon kartaa khatarta ka iman karta ka iibsashada Ookiyaalha ama muraayada indhaha ee heerka sare waddan shisheeye?,"The correct answer is **C: Daawadu waxay noqon kartaa mid been abuur ah** (The medication may be counterfeit).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that ""some may be copies"" when referring to high-end products in other countries. This directly translates to the risk of purchasing fake or counterfeit eyewear and medication.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Baaeitaan dheeraad ah oo lagu samayni doono Isha ayaa loo baahani** (Further eye testing will be needed) - While further testing is *always* good practice, it's not the specific *risk* of buying abroad.
*   **B: Daawadu waxa laga yaaba in aanay u ansax ahayn qaybo gaar ah** (The medication may not be approved for certain parts) - The passage doesn't mention approval issues, only the authenticity of the product.
*   **D: Waxa laga yaabaa in aanu caymisku uusan bixinin kharashka** (Insurance may not cover the cost) - While this is a potential issue, the passage focuses on the *quality* of the product itself, not insurance coverage.

"Marka la eego isticmaalka lacagta Falklands, keebaa sax ah bayaanadan soo socda?","The correct answer is **C: Poundka Falkland waa in la beddelaa marka laga tago jasiiradaha.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Waxa ay ay tahay mid aan suro gal aheyn sarifka lacagta Falklands marka aad ka so baxdo jasiirada, sarifka lacagta jirintaanka ka tegida jasiiradaha."" This directly translates to ""It is not advisable to exchange Falklands currency when you leave the islands, exchange the currency before leaving the islands.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kaliya kaararka deynta iyo giniga Ingiriiska ayaa laga aqbalaa jasiiradaha ka baxsan** - The text says credit cards are *not* widely accepted outside of Stanley, and US dollars *might* be accepted.
* **B: Stanley waa meesha kaliya ee aqbali doonta doolarka Mareykanka** - The text doesn't state that Stanley is the *only* place, just that US dollars are often accepted.
* **D: Marka laga reebo lacagta Pound-ka ee Falkland, pound-ka Ingiriiska guud ahaan waa lacagta ugu badan ee la aqbalo** - The text says British pounds are accepted *almost everywhere*, but doesn't say it's the most widely accepted besides the Falkland pound.



"
"Iyada oo ku saleysan tuduca, marka aad u safraysid Falklands adiga oo ka yimid Mareykanka, xagee laga yaabaa in nooc lacag-bixineed oo aan ahayn kaarka deynta ay faa'iido gaar ah leedahay?","The correct answer is **C: Jasiiradaha ka baxsan ee diwada ka ah**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Waxa ay ay tahay mid aan suro gal aheyn sarifka lacagta Falklands marka aad ka so baxdo jasiirada, sarifka lacagta jirintaanka ka tegida jasiiradaha."" It also says ""lacagta Ingiriiska iyo Maraykanka laga yaabo in la qaato; horey ka sii waydii mulkiilayaasha si aad u go'aansato habka lacag bixineed ee la aqbalayo."" This implies that on islands *outside* of Stanley, US dollars (and British pounds) might be useful as credit cards aren't widely accepted.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dukaanka FIC West:** This is where you exchange currency, not where a specific currency is *more* useful.
*   **B: Dhammaan jasiiradaha:** British Pounds and US dollars are not guaranteed to be widely accepted *everywhere* in the Falklands.
*   **D: Stanley oo dhan:** The passage says British Pounds and US dollars *might* be taken, but the emphasis is on confirming acceptance beforehand. It's not necessarily a benefit to have them.

Dhacdodee ayaan la xidhiidhin dabbaaldegga ciidaha macbudka?,"The correct answer is **C: Dhalashadii ilaahyaasha**.

The text states that festivals are often held ""before the birthday of the deity or any other event connected to the temple."" This directly links deity birthdays to temple celebrations.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Dhalashada maroodiga:** The text mentions maroodiyo (elephants) are *part* of the festivals, but the festivals aren't *about* the elephants' birthdays.
*   **B: Sanad guurada macbudka:** The text says festivals are often held as *part* of the temple anniversary, but aren't necessarily *only* for that.
*   **D: Dhacdooyinka waaweyn ee lugta ku leh macbudka:** This is a very broad statement and the text specifically mentions deity birthdays as a reason for festivals."
Halkee lagu arki karaa maroodiyaal la qurxiyey ee la sharaxay?,"The correct answer is **C: Geeddi-socodka xafladaha macbudka**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states, ""Xafladaha macbadka Kerala waa qaar aad u xiiso badan in la daawado, iyagoo leh maroodiyo la sharxay..."" This directly links the decorated floats to the temple festival *processions*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Meel kasta laga bilaabo dhamaadka Noofambar ilaa badhtamaha May** - This is the *timeframe* of the festivals, not where you see the floats.
* **B: Macbadyada dhexdooda** - The passage doesn't specify where the floats are *within* the temples. They're part of the celebrations *around* the temples.
* **D: Wadooyinka Kerala** - While the festivals likely travel through the streets, the passage emphasizes they are part of the *festival processions* themselves, not just randomly on the roads.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Kuwan soo socda keebaa ugu macquulsan ee lagu kaydini kara lacagta ganacsiga ama tikidka diyaarada heerka koowaad?","The correct answer is **D: Helitaanka qiimo dhimista**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ma jiro qodob taxaa marka loo eego qiimo dhimista ganacsiyada ama kuraasta dabaqada kowaad ee dagaalka ugu jirtay laga bilaabo A ilaa B."" This means there are no discounts available for business or first-class tickets. 

The passage highlights how expensive upgrades are, stating they can be 4x the price of a normal business class ticket and 10x the price of first class. The only mention of possibly reducing the cost is through employer coverage (""ku kharash gareeynaayo shirkaddaada"") but it's framed as *potentially* getting the company to pay, not a reliable way to save money.

Therefore, seeking a discount is the most logical way to try and save money, even if the passage suggests discounts are rare."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Maxaa wakhti lumis ah in la raadiyo marka la buuxsanaayo heerarka qiimaha qaarkooda?","The correct answer is **C: Qimo dhimista**

The passage states: ""Marka loo hadlo si guud,ma jiro qodob taxaa marka loo eego qiimo dhimista ganacsiyada ama kuraasta dabaqada kowaad ee dagaalka ugu jirtay laga bilaabo A ilaa B."" This directly translates to ""Generally, there's no point in looking for discounts on business class or first-class tickets for a direct flight from A to B.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Duulimaadyo toos ah** - The passage doesn't say there's no point in looking for direct flights; it focuses on the lack of discounts for higher classes.
*   **B: Heerka ganacsiga** - While the passage mentions business class, it says it's expensive, not that it's pointless to try and obtain it.
*   **D: Heerka kowaad** - Similar to business class, first class is expensive, but the passage doesn’t suggest it’s a waste of time to pursue it.

Here's why:

The prompt explicitly states to *add* the costs of extra visas, exit taxes, and ground transportation ""for all locations *outside* of Africa."" This means the cost of visas needed for countries *beyond* Africa need to be included in the overall cost calculation when comparing to worldwide travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Qiimaha canshuuraha dhoofka ee Afrika:** The prompt mentions exit taxes, but those are for leaving countries, not taxes *within* Africa.
*   **C: Qiimaha fiisaha Afrika:** The prompt is specifically about costs *outside* of Africa when making the comparison.  Visas *to* African countries would already be part of the African travel cost.
*   **D: Qiimaha gaadiidka dhulka ee meelaha ka baxsan Afrika:** The prompt explicitly states to include ground transportation costs *outside* of Africa."

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Si kordhaysa ayay dukaamadu u sameysanayaan qaybo cunto kala duwan oo diyaarsan ah."" This directly translates to ""Increasingly, stores are making different parts of prepared food.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kululeeyaha lagu kululeeyo cuntada (Food warmers)**: While the passage *mentions* stores having warmers, it doesn't say this is what they've *started* offering more of.
*   **C: Makhaayadaha goobta (In-store restaurants)**: The passage mentions restaurants being *available* in some stores, but not that stores are increasing their offerings of them.
*   **D: Qiima macquul gal ah oo la awoodi karo (Affordable prices)**: The passage says restaurants often have affordable prices, but it's not about what the stores themselves are *providing* more of.

The passage specifically states: ""Si kordhaysa ayay dukaamadu u sameysanayaan qaybo cunto kala duwan oo diyaarsan ah. Qaar ayaa xitaa leh kuleeliso ama qaab kale oo cuntada la kululaysto."" This directly refers to the availability of warmers/heaters for prepared food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Makhaayadaha goobta:** While the passage mentions restaurants in general, it doesn't say supermarkets *have* them.
*   **B: Xulashada yar ee kala duwan:** The passage says choice is *limited* compared to cooking from scratch, not that selection is a selling point.
*   **C: Cunto cayriin ah:** The passage doesn't mention anything about unappetizing food.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that pronunciation of words is slightly different in Belgian and Swiss French compared to the French spoken in France. While they are mutually intelligible overall, this difference in pronunciation could cause confusion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Habka nambarada Faransiiska ee caadiga ah loo qoro:** The passage says the *system of numbers* is different, implying a difference in how they are said or expressed, but not necessarily the standard way they are written.
*   **B: Erayada gaarka ah ee Faransiiska:** The text doesn't mention unique words. It focuses on differences in pronunciation and number systems.
*   **D: Inta badan Afka-Faransiiska looga hadlo Faransiiska:** The passage states that Belgian and Swiss French speakers learn standard French in school *to understand* French spoken in France, indicating they are generally able to understand it.



"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan la mid ahayn Faransiiska sida lan laga isticmaalo Belgium ama Switzerland?,"The correct answer is **C: Heerka Faransiiska ee dugsiyada lagu dhigo**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that people in Belgium and Switzerland *learn* standard French in school. This is to ensure they *can* understand standard French.  The passage highlights differences in pronunciation and number systems, but implies a common base in standard French learned in school.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku dhawaaqida ereyada oo dhan:** The passage mentions slight differences in pronunciation.
*   **B: Habka nambarada loo qoro:** The passage specifically highlights differences in the number system.
*   **D: Higaada ama qorista erayada Faransiiska qaarkood:** Differences in spelling (higaada/qorista) are implied by differences in the language itself.



"
Xaaladdee ayay u badan tahay in aan lagu siinin lacagta tacsiyada?,"The correct answer is **A: Haddii aad ku duuleyso WestJet**.

The passage states that some smaller airlines *still* offer bereavement fares, and lists WestJet among them. This implies that they are less common now, and other airlines may not offer them. The passage doesn't say anything to suggest the other options would result in not receiving the fare."
Maxaa ka run ah lacagta safarka tacsiyada?,"The correct answer is **D: Waa in si toos ah looga ballansadaa diyaaradda iyada oo lagala xiriiraayo telefoon.**

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Si walbaba, waa inaad boos ku qabsatid adigoo si toos ah telefoon ugu diraysid shirkadda diyaaradda."" This means you must contact the airline directly by phone to claim these fares.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waxay daboolayaan oo lagu bixiyaa kharashka safarka aaska** - The text doesn't mention covering funeral travel expenses.
*   **B: Waa in si toos ah loogu ballansado mareegaha diyaaradda** - The text explicitly says you *cannot* book through the airline's website.
*   **C: Waxay daboolayaan kharashka safarka daqiiqadaha ugu dambeeya** - While they relate to last-minute travel, they aren't covering the cost *of* last-minute travel, but offering reduced fares.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hadii aanu khad kuugu xirnayn moobilkaaga, ama marka uu ka baxo aagiisa, shaqadoodu way xaddidmaysaa ama lamaba helayo."" This directly means that GPS apps on your phone rely on a data connection.  A standalone GPS device doesn't need a data connection to function, making it more reliable when you're offline.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Markaad isku dayayso inaad lacag kaydsato:** While the passage mentions saving money, it doesn't say a standalone GPS is *specifically* better for saving money.
*   **B: Marka aad hubiso inaad u baahnaan doontid isku xirka xogta khadka:**  You'd check *before* relying on an app, not when you're in the situation.
*   **D: Marka aadan rabin inaad kireysato aalada:** This is about preference, not functionality. The passage highlights the usefulness of GPS devices specifically when you *don't* have data.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Hadii aanu khad kuugu xirnayn moobilkaaga, ama marka uu ka baxo aagiisa, shaqadoodu way xaddidmaysaa ama lamaba helayo.""  This means the biggest downside of using phone-based GPS apps is their reliance on a data connection. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Keydinta lacagta** - The passage *highlights* saving money as a benefit of apps, not a drawback.
*   **C: Ka fogaanshaha kirada** - Avoiding rental fees is a benefit.
*   **D: U baahnan la’aanta inaad iibsato khariidadaha cusub** - Not needing to buy new maps is a benefit."

This directly supports the idea of using a Galapagos travel specialist (a wakiilka ku takhasusay safarka ee Galapagos) to ensure you're matched with the right ship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text doesn't mention group size or shared interests as a way to find a suitable ship.
*   **B:** While timing can affect availability, it doesn't guarantee a *suitable* ship, just a spot on one.
*   **D:** Booking early (Isdiiwaangalinta wakhti hore) is suggested because ships fill up, but doesn't guarantee the ship will be the *right* fit for your needs."

Here's why:

The passage focuses on tactics casinos use to *keep* gamblers gambling. It mentions:

*   **Time investment:** People spend a lot of time and money.
*   **Lack of time awareness:** Clocks are often missing, making it difficult to track time.
*   **Amenities:** Special food, drinks, and entertainment are provided to keep guests in a good mood and on the premises.
*   **Accessibility of alcohol:** Readily available alcohol.

These are all deliberate strategies to encourage continued gambling.

Let's look at the options:

*   **B: Dhiirigelinta sida tigidhada riwaayadaha bilaashka ah (Encouraging things like free show tickets):** This is a clear tactic to attract and retain customers.
*   **C: Cabbitaannada bilaashka ah (Free drinks):** Directly mentioned in the passage as a way to keep people gambling.
*   **D: Maqnaanshaha saacadaha (Lack of clocks):** Also directly mentioned as a tactic to make people lose track of time.
*   **A: Iftiinka dabiiciga ah oo badan (Lots of natural light):**  The passage doesn't mention anything about lighting. In fact, casinos are often designed to *minimize* natural light to disorient patrons.  More natural light wouldn't be a strategy to keep people gambling, it would likely have the opposite effect.

Therefore, abundant natural light isn't a tactic casinos use to encourage prolonged gambling."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, waa maxay waxyaabaha qofka khamaarka ku takhasusay aay tahay inuu iska ilaaliyo?","The correct answer is **A: Cabitaanka khamriga badan**.

Here's why:

The passage states that many venues offer alcohol and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and encourage them to stay. However, it then concludes by saying that *all* gamblers know the benefit of staying sober. This directly implies that excessive drinking is something a professional gambler should avoid.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Aqbalaadda shaqa walbo oo bilaash ah oo dhiirigelin lagu qabto:** While accepting too much free stuff could be a bad strategy, the passage doesn't specifically mention it.
*   **C: Hubinta saacadaha aan la qaadi karin ama saacadaha gacanta:** The passage mentions time being lost and difficulty finding watches, but not that a gambler should *check* them.
*   **D: Weydiinaayo meesha ugu dhow ee laga baxo:** The passage doesn't discuss needing to find exits.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that **all nouns, including words *you* have, begin with a capital letter, even mid-sentence**. This is to distinguish them from verbs.  Therefore, the capitalized words are referring to names, places, and people - which are all nouns.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Erayga ficilka (The verb)**: The passage states capital letters are used to *distinguish* nouns *from* verbs, not to identify verbs themselves.
*   **C: Erayga faahfaahinaya Sifooyinka (The describing words/Adjectives)**: The passage doesn't mention adjectives being capitalized.
*   **D: Fal-kabyada (Adverbs)**: The passage doesn't mention adverbs being capitalized.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...in kasta oo qoraalku waxoogaa ay adkaysay baahida loo qabo in la ogaado nooca falka ama sifeeyaha ee la adeegsaday."" This directly means the writing style *makes reading slightly more difficult* because you have to figure out the part of speech.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kala soocida Erayada ficilka (Distinguishing verb words)** - While the rule *helps* with this, the passage says the *difficulty* comes from needing to figure out parts of speech generally, not just verbs.
*   **C: Qoritaanka (Writing)** - The passage focuses on the effect on *reading*, not the act of writing itself.
*   **D: Kala soocidda walxaha ama sheeyaasha (Distinguishing nouns from pronouns)** - This is implied as a benefit of the rule, but not what the passage identifies as a difficulty.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Leexitaanka farta muruubsatada ama murdisada** - This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **C: Nooca salaanta gacma isku dhufsashada** - The text discusses misinterpretations of waving, not handshakes.
* **D: Tilmaanta ka dhigan mahadsanid ee suul isku taaga** - The text focuses on greetings and requests to come closer, not expressions of gratitude.



"
"""Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca tilmaantee macnaheedu noqon karaa """"soo noqo""""?""","The correct answer is **C: Luxitaanka ama haaditaanka calaacasha oo xagga gudaha uu ka sii jeedo** (Waving the palm facing inwards towards yourself).

The passage states that in Spain, waving the hand as a greeting (palm towards the person greeting) can be misinterpreted as a signal to ""come back"" - meaning the wave is facing *inwards* towards the person waving. Option C accurately describes this.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** Incorrect. The passage says the inward wave means ""come back.""
*   **B:** Incorrect. The passage links the lowering of the index finger to the ""come here"" gesture.
*   **D:** Incorrect. The passage does not mention head nodding as having this meaning."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaa sababa dildilaaca?","The correct answer is **B: Barafka aan xasilloonayn ama aan daganayn**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Baraf-cagaarku ma xasiloona, laakin buurta ayuu hoos uga soo qulqula. Tani waxay sababi kartaa dildilaacyo...""  This directly translates to ""The ice floe is unstable, but it slides down from the mountain. This can cause avalanches..."" 

Therefore, the instability of the ice is what *causes* the avalanches (dildilaacyo).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Barafka buundooyinka:**  The passage says avalanches can *hide* ice bridges, not that they are caused by them.
* **C: Dumitaanka godadka barafka ah:** The passage says collapses of ice cave walls and ceilings *are a result* of avalanches, not the cause.
* **D: Baloogyada ama Bulukeetiyada aadka aan isku haysanin:** This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, kuwan Kee baa lagu qarin karaa barafka buundooyinka?","The correct answer is **A: dildilaaca (avalanches)**.

The text explicitly states: ""... waxay sababi kartaa dildilaacyo, dillaacyo, kuwaasoo laga yaabo inay qariyaan buundooyinka barafka."" This directly translates to ""...it can cause avalanches, which may bury ice bridges.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Godadka barafka ah (ice caves)** - The text says the walls and ceilings of ice caves can *collapse* due to avalanches, but doesn't say avalanches bury them.
*   **C: Darbiyada (walls)** - The text says walls of ice caves can collapse, but doesn't mention avalanches burying walls in general.
*   **D: Baloogyada ama bulukeetiyada waaweyn (large slabs)** - The text says large slabs can break off and fall, but doesn't say avalanches bury them.

"Iyada oo ku saleysan marinka, socotada waa in ay qaataan taxadar dheeraad ah ka hor inta aysan booqan goobtee?","The correct answer is **B: Degaanada ku hareeraysan Goma**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...visits outside Goma require investigation to understand the conflict situation in North Kivu province."" This indicates that the areas *surrounding* Goma are the ones with potential dangers related to conflict, requiring extra caution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Foolkaannada Nyiragongo:** While the passage mentions the volcano, the caution relates to conflict, not the volcano itself.
*   **C: Bartamaha magaalada:** The passage mentions the city center was damaged by lava, but not that it's currently dangerous.
*   **D: Rwanda:** Rwanda is mentioned only for its proximity to Goma, not as a place requiring caution for visitors related to this passage."
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan talo fiican u noqon doonin dalxiiska Goma?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagaallada ka socda Waqooyiga Kivu waa kuwo aad u xiiso badan**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that visitors to Goma need to *research the security situation in North Kivu* due to ongoing conflict.  Saying the conflict is ""interesting"" is insensitive and disregards the dangers it poses to tourists.  It's absolutely *not* something to encourage or view positively when considering a trip.

Let's look at why the other options are reasonable based on the passage:

* **B:** The text says Goma is a base for ""some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.""
* **C:**  The passage mentions ""boda-bodas"" (motorcycle taxis) as a common and affordable way to get around.
* **D:** The text states Goma is a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano.



"
Goorma ayaa la heli karaa ogolaanshaha dhulka miyiga ah ee aan la deganayn ee maalinta bilawga ah ee Ogoosto?,"The correct answer is **A: 1-da Janaayo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ogolaansho miyi u bixiseed kasta oo maalin bilow kasta oo bisha May ah wuxu diyaar noqonayaa 1 da Janaayo.""  Since August 1st is a first-of-the-month date, and it falls within the four-month window that starts May 1st, it becomes available on January 1st.
"
Waa maxay siyaasadda loo dejiyay si loo ilaaliyo dhulka dhagaxa ee canyonka?,"The correct answer is **D: Tiro xaddidan ee oggolaanshaha ah**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that permits are ""limited"" and available on the 1st of the month for four months.
*   It also mentions that popular spots fill up quickly, indicating a limited number of permits are available and are highly sought after.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nidaamka oggolaanshaha shaqsiga ugu so dhaqsado mudnaanta la siinaayo** - While the text *implies* speed in applying is important, it doesn't state this is the formal policy.
*   **B: Ogolaanshaha waxa la heli karaa Janaayo 1deeda** - This is *a* date when permits become available, but it doesn't define the policy.
*   **C: Ogolaanshaha waxaa lagu heli karaa oo keliya codsiyada soo gelista** - The text doesn't limit permits to only those entering through specific points.



"
Kuwan soo socda kee baa lacala laga yaaba in laga helo hudheellada lagu tilmaamay tuduca?,"The correct answer is **C: Martida kale ee caanka ah ama la aqoonsan karo**.

Here's why:

The text states these hotels historically catered to ""dadka taajiriinta iyo kuwa caanka ah"" (the wealthy and famous).  It also mentions they *sometimes* accommodated heads of state and VIPs. Therefore, encountering other notable or recognizable guests would be a likely experience at these hotels.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baarka cabitaanka khamriga qasan:** While they may have bars, the text focuses on the clientele and atmosphere, not specifically the quality of the bar.
*   **B: Maqaayad goobta ah oo laga helaayo cunto tayadeedu sareeyso:** The text mentions good food was *part of* the experience, but doesn't emphasize a high-end restaurant as a unique feature.
*   **D: Qolal dhawaan la cusboonaysiiyay oo qaab casriyaysan loo sameeyay:** The text explicitly states these hotels are characterized by ""Qalabka duugga ah"" (old equipment) and a lack of modern amenities.  Modernized rooms would be the *opposite* of what you'd find.



"
"Iyadoo lagu salaynayo xogta lagu soo bandhigay tuducda, midkee bixinta soo socda ayaa martida hoteeladu u badan tahay inay mudnaanta siiyaan?","The correct answer is **B: Makhaayad leh cunto kariye caan ah**.

Here's why:

The passage states that these hotels ""often had excellent food and evening entertainment."" This directly points to the importance of high-quality dining experiences. The hotels catered to wealthy and famous guests who would appreciate fine dining.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Qalabka qadiimiga ah laga heli karo guriga oo dhan** - While the passage mentions antique furnishings are *part of their culture*, it doesn't imply this is what guests prioritize.
*   **C: Qolka nasashada oo bixiya maaweelo haweenka la sameeyo** - This is a very specific service not mentioned in the text and doesn't fit the overall description of luxury and elegance.
*   **D: Qol Kiradiisa la awoodi karo** - The passage says these hotels were for wealthy individuals. Affordable rooms are the opposite of that.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Maxaa la iska ilaalinayaa dadka safarka ah ee booqanaya Greenland?","The correct answer is **D: Ku magacaawida dadka u dhashay Greenland sida “Eskimo”**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Inkastoo ereyga “Eskimo” ayaa ah erey laga ogolahay Maraykanka, waa erey yasitaan ku ah qowmiyadaha Arctic ku nool... waa inay iska ilaaliyaan ajaanibku."" (Although the word ""Eskimo"" is acceptable in the United States, it is a derogatory term for the Arctic peoples... foreigners should avoid using it.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage specifically says Greenland has very little crime (""Dembiga... gebi ahaanba lagama yaqaan Greenland"").
*   **B:** The passage warns about bringing *warm* clothes due to the cold climate, not avoiding them because it's hot.
*   **C:** The passage states Greenland has excellent internet connectivity.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Kuwan soo socda kee baa u badan inuu dhib ku hayo socotada aan diyaarga ahayn ee booqanaya Greenland?","The correct answer is **C: Cimilada**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Cimilada qabow waxaa laga yaaba iney tahay qatarta xaqiiqda keliya ee aan loo diyaar garoobin la wajahi doono. Hadaad booqato Greenland xiliyada qawowga...waxaa muhiim kuu ahaani inaad la imaadid dhar culus."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kaneecada Waqooyiga Yurub:** The passage mentions these as a nuisance, not a serious danger (""Inkastoo xanuun ay kuu keeneynin, way ku dhibayaan."").
*   **B: Dembiga:** The passage clearly states that crime is virtually non-existent in Greenland (""Dembiga...gebi ahaanba lagama yaqaan Greenland."").
*   **D: Dadka deegaanka:** The passage describes the locals as friendly and not posing a threat (""Dembiga, iyo niyad-xumi loo qabo ajaanibta guud ahaan, gebi ahaanba lagama yaqaan Greenland."")."
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda ayaa hadda loo isticmaalaa sidii central plaza?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The text states: ""Hadda waxay u shaqeyneysa sida xarunta bartamaha, iyo marlwalba ay jiraan waxbadan, malin iyo habeen."" referring to Jardín de la Unión.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Keebaa kuwan soo socda aan laga helin Jardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **D: Dhismaha machadka aadka u da’ada weyn**.

Here's why:

*   The text states the *Jardín de la Unión* was built on the site of demolished 17th-century buildings and is the *only* surviving structure. It doesn't mention any sort of ""institute"" building being present.
*   **A** is correct: The text mentions a small theatre in the center of the garden where performances are held.
*   **B** is correct: The *Callejon del Beso* (Alley of the Kiss) is specifically described as a location of a famous love story.
*   **C** is correct: The text explicitly states there are several restaurants around the garden.

Therefore, the only option *not* mentioned in the text is a building from an old institute."
"Iyadoo lagu salaynayo tuducda, keebaa bayaanadan soo socda ee ku saabsan socod maalmeedka loo qaadan karaa inuu yahay mid khalad ah?","The correct answer is **D: Socod maalmeedku maaha hawl ku habboon bannaanka qoysaska oo aay carruurta ku suganyihiin**.

Here's why:

The passage *specifically states* that ""Qoysaska leh caruur yar yar waxay u bahan yahiin iney sameeyaan diyaar garow, lakin shaqada maalin laha way fududa tahay xitaa caruur aad ka u yar yar iyo caruurta iskuul dhigata."" This directly contradicts option D, which claims hiking is *not* suitable for families with children.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A:** The passage states ""socodka maalinta ee waddo sahlan la qaadayo diyaar garaw yar buu u baahan yahay"" - supporting the idea that less preparation is needed for easier, shorter hikes.
*   **B:** The passage mentions ""masaafo ka yar hal may ilaa masaafooyinka dhaadheer ee maalin la goyn karo"" - highlighting the varying distances but the commonality of completing it within a single day.
*   **C:** The passage says ""qof kasto si dhexdhexaada u caafimaad qabaana waa xiisayn doonaa"" – indicating a moderate level of fitness is generally sufficient.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Goorma ayuu socod maalmeedku u baahan yahay diyaargarow aad u yar?","The correct answer is **B: Marka lagu socdalaayo wado sahlan**

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Socdaalka maalinta ee waddo sahlan la qaadayo diyaar garaw yar buu u baahan yahay..."" This directly links minimal preparation to easy trails.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Marka tamashlaha ama qofka socodka sameeynaayo uu jir ahaan taam yahay** - While being in good health is helpful, the text doesn't say it *causes* less preparation to be needed. It says anyone in decent health *can* enjoy it.
*   **C: Marka carruurtu ay aadayaa socdaalka** - The text actually says that families with young children *need* to do more preparation, not less.
*   **D: Marka socodku lagu sameeynaayo jawi dabiici ah oo dheeraad ah** - The text mentions natural terrain, but doesn't connect that to reduced preparation."
Maxay kaga duwan tahay dhulalka fidsan ee Rogaland ama Agder marka lala barbar dhigo Norway inteeda kale?,"The correct answer is **C: Dhulka fidsan inta badan waa siman yahay**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that in Rogaland and Agder, the open areas (""hei"") are characterized as *without trees, covered in heather*.  This implies a more open, flat landscape.
* The passage contrasts this with the typical Norwegian landscape of *deep valleys and long, steep mountainsides* leading to plateaus (""vidde"").  The ""hei"" areas don't have those features.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waxay leeyihiin geedo** - The text specifically says ""hei"" areas are *without trees*.
* **B: Ma lahan goobaha buuraha dhexdooda ah ee biyaha ku jiraan ee fjords-ka** - The passage doesn't mention fjords specifically relating to the difference between these regions.
* **D: Badanaa waxay ku daboolan yihiin kuleylka** - The passage doesn't mention heat or climate.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Midkee ayaan ahayn kuwan soo socda wax aan caadi ka ah Norway?","Jawaabta saxda ah waa **C: Meelaha biya galeenka buuraha Fjords-ka oo dhaadheer**.

Sababta:

Tuduca waxa uu si gaar ah u sheegaa godad iyo dooxooyin dhaadheer iyo dhulka furan (""vidde"" iyo ""hei""). Wuxuu si toos ah u tilmaamaa noocyo gaar ah oo dhul ah oo Norway ka caadiga ah. Fjords-ka, iyadoo ah qeyb muhiim ah oo Norway ah, kama muuqato aqriyihii.

Halkan ayay u dhacayaan doorashooyinka kale:

*   **A: Baaxadda dhulka oo furan:** Tuduca waxa uu si cad u sheegaa dhulka furan (""vidde"").
*   **B: Dhulka fidsan ee leh dhirta aadka u badan:** Tuduca waxa uu sheegaa dhirta yar (""dhir la'"").
*   **D: Dhulka sare ee daaqsiinta ah:** Tuduca waxa uu sheegaa dhul sare oo furan (""bannaano sare"")."
Goorma ayay tahay in dalxiisayaasha xiisaynaya ciyaarta barafka ee skiing-ka ay booqdaan saldhigyada buuraha?,"The correct answer is **A: Xilliga jiilaalka**.

Here's why:

The passage states that many resorts ""heelan tiro caafirmad xiliga barafka iyo ku deeqid shaqooyin sida ciyaaraha baraf ka"" (offer a number of attractions during the snowy season and provide activities like snow sports). This directly links snow sports (like skiing) to the winter season (xilliga jiilaalka).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Inta lagu jiro xilliga jawiga ugu sarreeya:** This is too vague. The passage specifies *snow* activities, which are winter-specific.
*   **C: Xilliga xagaaga Hindiya:** The passage says tourism peaks in the summer, but snow sports aren't available then.
*   **D: Xilliga gu'ga:** Spring isn't typically associated with consistent snow conditions for skiing.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Goorma ayaa inta badan dalxiisayaasha ugu badan yihiin saldhigyada buuraha?","The correct answer is **C: Xilliga xagaaga Hindiya**.

The passage states: ""Xilli dalxiiseedka istaamada buuruhu waxa uu heerka ugu sarreeya gaaraa inta badan inta lagu jiro xagaaga Hindiya."" (The tourist season for mountain stations reaches its peak mostly during the Indian summer.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Inta lagu jiro xiliga barafka aad da’o** - While the passage mentions winter activities, it doesn't say this is *when most* tourists visit.
*   **B: Inta lagu jiro xilli ciyaadeedka snowboarding-ka barafka** - Similar to A, this is an activity *during* the season, not the peak season itself.
*   **D: Bilaha jiilaalka oo dhan** - Again, the passage focuses on summer being the peak."
Maxaa loo baahanyahay inaad ka fogaataa inaad samayso haddii aad rajaynayso inaad hesho doon taas oo raadinaysa gargaar?,"The correct answer is **D: Iska indho tirka dadka agtaada lifti radiska ah**.

Here's why:

The prompt emphasizes the importance of *talking to as many people as possible* in the harbor. Ignoring people (lifting your gaze/looking away) would directly contradict this strategy and hinder your chances of finding someone looking for help.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: In aad kor iyo hoos ugu bodboodo goobta doomaha aay kuso xirtaan:**  Simply walking around isn't enough; you need to *engage* with people.
*   **B: La saaxibitaanka darawalada maraakiibta:**  Building relationships with captains is a good idea, but not something you should *avoid*.  The prompt encourages interaction.
*   **C: Xayeysiinta adeegyadaada:** Promoting yourself is what the prompt suggests you *should* do, not avoid.



"
Maxaad samayn kartaa marka aad ku sugantahay agagaarka marinas oo aad raadinayso doon u baahan caawimaad?,"The correct answer is **A: Inaad lla xidhiidho badmaaxayaasha** (You should contact the sailors).

Here's why:

The prompt explicitly states you should try to connect with sailors at the bar (""isku dayi doontaa inaad la xiriirto bad-maaxyada baarka jooga""). The goal is to talk to as many people as possible to find a boat needing help.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Inaad iska hoos toogtid saacada jihada** (You should lower the compass hour) - This is irrelevant to finding a boat.
*   **C: Kaliya la xiriir dadka marka ay nadiifinayaan doonidooda** (Only contact people when they are cleaning their boats) - The prompt suggests talking to people cleaning boats *as well as* others. It's not the only approach.
*   **D: Iska ilaali kuwa lifti raadiska ah** (Avoid those with lifting traces) - This is nonsensical in the context of the prompt.



"
Goobtee ayaa rafcaan u noqon doonta dalxiisyaasha xiisaynaya taariikhda gumeysiga jasiiradda?,"The correct answer is **A: Xeebta Waqooyi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dhulka magaalada laga sameeyay ee Jasiirada Hong Kong intiisa badan waxa uu ku uruursan yahay dhul xeebta waqooyi laga soo jaray. Halkani waa halkii gumeystayaashii Ingiriisku yeesheen markaas hadii aad raadinayso caddaynta raadkii gumeysiga ee dhulka, halkani waa meel ku fiican in laga bilaabo."" This directly indicates that the North Shore is where the land reclamation occurred and where the British colonial presence began, making it the best place to find evidence of colonial history.



"
Goobtee ayaa soo jiidan doonta dalxiiska mudnaanta siiya aragtiyaha cajiibka ah?,"The correct answer is **D: Kowloon waterfront**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Si aad u hesho muqaalka ugu wanaagsan Hong Kong, ka tag jasiirada oo tag kasoo horjeedka biyo shubadka Kowloon."" This directly translates to: ""To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the opposite side of the Victoria Harbour, Kowloon."" 

While Victoria Harbour is mentioned, the passage specifically highlights the Kowloon waterfront as the place to *get the best views* of Hong Kong."
Maxay haystaan ​​qaar ka mid ah koorayaasha kuwaas oo ka caawinaya waxyaabaha yar ee khatarta ah in qofka fuushanaya qaybta uu saaranaayo cagtiisa?,"The correct answer is **B: Qaybaha la qabsado ee amaanka ah**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states that ""some English-style stirrups have a safety bar that has a wide section to catch if one is pulled sideways."" This directly refers to safety features designed to prevent the rider's foot from getting stuck.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kabo cidhiidhi ah:** The passage mentions tight-fitting boots, but these are for general fit, not specifically a safety feature to prevent getting caught.
*   **C: Qaybta cagsaarka oo maqaar ka samaysan:** The passage doesn't mention the material of the stirrup footbed.
*   **D: Degenaansho aad u sareeysa:** While stirrups provide stability, the passage focuses on the *safety* aspect of preventing foot entrapment.

Maxaa la siiyaa socotada iyada oo loo marayo shabakadaha isweydaarsiga martigelinta?,"The correct answer is **A: Hoyga martida deegaanka**.

Here's why:

The passage states that these networks ""connect travelers with locals who are willing to offer accommodation."" This directly translates to providing travelers with **local home stays**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Duulimaadyo qiima jaban:** The passage mentions Casey Fenton getting a cheap flight *to* Iceland, but the network itself doesn't provide cheap flights.
*   **C: Dalxiisyada ay bixiyaan hagayaasha deegaanka:** The passage doesn't mention tours or guides.
*   **D: Xiriirinta dadka safarka ah ee doonayaa inay booqdaan goobaha isku meelka ah:** While the network *does* connect travelers, the primary offering is the accommodation itself, not just the connection.



"
"Iyada oo ku saleysan marinka, weedhaha soo socda ee ku saabsan shabakadaha isweydaarsiga martigelinta aan run ahayn?","Jawaabta saxda ah waa **A: Socotada waxaa had iyo jeer la siiyaa tixraacyo loogu talagalay martigeliyaha maxalliga ah.**

Sababta:

Marinka wuxuu sheegay in liiska martigeliyayaasha laga heli karo, laakiin ma sheegin in socotada *had iyo jeer* la siiyo tixraabyo gaar ah. Waxa uu sheegay in qiimeyn laga sameeyay dad kale ay mararka qaarna la socoto, laakiin taa macnaheedu maaha in tixraabyo la siiyo.

*   **C:** Marinka wuxuu sheegay in liiska martigeliyayaasha laga heli karo waraaq ahaan iyo/ama online.
*   **D:** Marinka wuxuu sheegay in dib u eegista martigeliyaha maxaliga ah ay mararka qaarkood diyaar u ahay socotada."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, marti noocee ah ayaa ugu yaraan laga yaabaa in qolka hostel-ka la wadaago?","The correct answer is **C: Marti la socdaalaysa caruur yaryar**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Qoysaska leh caruur waa ay ku yar yahiin"" (Families with children are rare). This directly indicates that you are least likely to share a room with someone traveling with young children.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Martida wali kujira da’ada labaatanaadka** - The text says young adults are *common* in hostels.
*   **B: Marti kali socdaalaysa** - The text doesn't give information about solo travelers.
*   **D: Martida wali kujira bartamaha da’ada soddomeeyada** - The text mentions older travelers are *often* found there, making them relatively common.



"
"Iyada oo ku saleysan marinka, yaa ugu badan inuu ku sii nagaado hostel-ka?","The correct answer is **B: Saddex 22 jiryaal ah oo si wada jir u safraya**.

Here's why:

The passage states hostels are ""most often people in their youth - a typical guest is in their twenties."" While older travelers are sometimes present, and some allow private rooms for families, the *primary* demographic is young adults.  Three 22-year-olds fit that description perfectly.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Lamaanaha la socdaalaya ilmo dhawaan dhashay:** The passage says families with children are *rare* at hostels.
*   **C: Lamaane kujira da’ada 70 jirka ah:** The passage mentions older travelers, but they aren't the *most* common guests.
*   **D: Laba qoys oo la socdaalaya ama la safraayo caruurtooda:** Again, families are noted as being uncommon.

Halkan waxaa ku jira sababaha aan xulashada kale u ahayn:

*   **A:** Qoraalku ma sheegayo in boomarang-ku *had iyo jeer* gacantaada ay ku soo noqon doono. Wuxuu sheegayaa inaad u baahan tahay mid ku habboon soo noqosho.
*   **B:** Qoraalku wax ma ka sheego sida caanka ah ee ciyaarta dadka deegaanka ah iyo dalxiisayaasha.
*   **C:** Qoraalku wax ma ka sheego inta boomarang ee laga heli karo Australia."
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda inta badan loo isticmaalo cunnada Javanese-ka?,"The correct answer is **C: Sonkorta qumbaha**.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, sidee buu cudurada faafa aay u faafaan?","The correct answer is **A: Dadka uu cudurka ku dhacay** (People who are infected with the disease).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Cudur faafa waa cudur si hawl yar la isugu gudbin karo hadii aad u dhawaato agagaarka qof sadhaysan.""  This directly translates to ""A contagious disease is one that can be easily transmitted if you are near an infected person.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Waxyaalaha cudurka sababa** (Things that cause the disease) - This refers to germs like viruses or bacteria, but doesn't explain *how* it spreads.
*   **C: Waxyaalaha Bakteeriyada** (Things about bacteria) -  Too specific; contagious diseases can be caused by viruses, fungi, etc., not just bacteria.
*   **D: Talaallada** (Vaccinations) - Vaccinations *prevent* disease, they don't cause it to spread.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, waa maxay waxa aan la aqoon inuu keeno cudurada faafa?","The correct answer is **B: Fayrasyada (Viruses)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Cudur caabuqeed waa mid uu keenay jeermis-side sida **fayras**, bakteeriyo, fangas, ama dulin kale."" and then defines ""Cudur faafa"" (contagious disease) as one spread easily through close contact.  While bacteria and fungi *can* cause contagious diseases, the passage explicitly links viruses to infectious diseases in general.  It doesn't state what *specifically* causes contagious diseases, only that they spread easily. However, viruses are the most common cause of contagious diseases.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Talaallada (Vaccines):** Vaccines *prevent* diseases, they don't *cause* them.
*   **C: Bakteeriyada (Bacteria):** While bacteria cause some contagious diseases, not all do. Many bacterial infections aren’t easily spread.
*   **D: Fangiyada (Fungi):** Fungal infections are generally not considered easily contagious in the same way viral or some bacterial infections are.

Xaaladee ayey ka doorashada nidaamka galitaanka shabakada laga dooranaayo VPN-ka shakhsiyeed aay kala filnaani doontaa isticmaalaha?,"The correct answer is **B: Isticmaaluhu wuxuu ka walaacsan yahay ka fogaanshaha inay baxaan xogyaha muhiimka ah iyo basaasnimada intii suurtagal ah.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the benefits of a personal VPN are privacy and security:** ""Way xaffidan yihiin markaas way adag tahay in la basaaso."" and ""they route all internet traffic, not just http.""  This directly addresses concerns about data leaks and espionage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While a VPN *does* reroute data, the passage focuses on *all* data, not just the desire to reroute it.  The benefit is security, not just the rerouting itself.
* **C:** The passage specifically contrasts VPNs with web proxies because VPNs handle *all* traffic, not just HTTP.  Focusing on HTTP is a weakness of proxies, and therefore not a reason to *choose* a VPN.
* **D:** While speed and quality of service are mentioned (""Caadiyan waxay baxshaan xawaare intan ka dheer iyo adeeg ka tayo fiican""), the primary selling point in the context of political/business situations is privacy and security.  Speed is a secondary benefit.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Keebaa bayaanadan soo socda ee ku saabsan VPN-yada iyo wakiillada shabakadda aan run ahayn?","The correct answer is **D: VPN-yadu waxa ay dib u soo celin karaan oo keliya taraafikada http**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that VPNs ""dib u jiheeyaan dhammaan saxmadda internetka, keliya maaha http."" This directly contradicts option D, making it the false statement.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

*   **A: VPN-yadu inta badan waxay bixiyaan awoodda ay shabakada xogta ku gudbin karto oo sarreeya marka loo eego wakiillada shabakadda:** The text says they ""baxshaan xawaare intan ka dheer"" which supports this.
*   **B: Wakiilada shabakada ma celin karaan dhammaan xogaha taraafikada shabakada:** The text implies this by stating VPNs reroute *all* internet traffic, suggesting proxies don't do that.
*   **C: Wakiilada shabakada waxay leeyihiin adeeg tayadiisu hooseeyso marka loo eego VPN-yada:**  The text says VPNs have ""adeeg ka tayo fiican,"" which supports this.

Maxaa u ogolaanaya qof inuu isticmaalo shirkad telefoon meel ka baxsan aagooda ugu dhow?,"The correct answer is **B: Nambarada telefoonada caalamiga ah**.

Here's why:

The text states that you don't need a local phone company and can get a separate international number that allows regular phones (PSTN) to call you.  This is the key to being able to use a phone service from a different location.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nidaamka sida otomatigada ah kaga jawaabo wicitaanada:** While auto-answering systems exist, they don't *enable* you to use a phone company from a different location.
*   **C: Dayax gacmeedyada:** This is irrelevant to the topic.
*   **D: Telefoonnada PSTN:** PSTN phones are the *ones calling* the international number, not what allows the service to work across locations.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaa loo baahan karaa in la sameeyo si loo qabto wicitaanada qaarkood?","The correct answer is **A: Iibso lambarka caalamiga ah**.

The passage specifically states: ""Inta badan, waa inaad u iibsataa lambar caalami si gaara kaasoo ogolaanaya in taleefanada PSTN ku soo wacaan."" This directly indicates the need to purchase an international number for certain calls.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Isticmaal shirkad telefoon oo maxalli ah:** The passage says you *don't* need a local phone company.
* **C: Ka hel lambarka beesha deegaankaaga:**  The passage states you don't need a local area code.
* **D: Iibso taleefanka PSTN:** The passage refers to *using* PSTN phones to call *you* but doesn't say you need to buy one.

Kuwa soo socda keebaa aan si sax ah u qeexin ku dhawaaqida erayada Talyaaniga?,"The correct answer is **A: r la labajibbaaray waxaa loogu dhawaqaa si ka duwan hal r**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage specifically states:** ""Sidoo kale, hubi in aad ugu dhawaaqdo si kala duwan r iyo rr: caro waxaa la micno tahay qaali, halka carro ay la micno tahay gariga faraska lagu xiro.""  This directly supports the idea that a doubled 'r' (rr) is pronounced differently than a single 'r'.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Inta badan erayada waxaa loogu dhawaaqaa sida loo qoro:** The passage says that pronunciation is *generally* easy because words are often pronounced as they're written, but it also highlights exceptions (C, G, R/RR).
*   **C: Erayada xarfaha c iyo g waxay noqon karaan kuwo aad u adag:** The passage states that the pronunciation of 'C' and 'G' *follows* the vowel, implying they aren't inherently difficult, just context-dependent.
*   **D: Ku dhawaaqida erayada badidood way kala duwan yihiin iyadoo ku xidhan shaqalka soo socda:** While the passage does mention vowel influence, it frames it as a rule that makes pronunciation *more consistent* rather than wildly variable."

Halkan waxaa ah sababta jawabaha kale ay khaldan yihiin:

*   **A: Jidadka ballaaran ama balaca leh** - Qormada ayaa tilmaamaysa jidadka ballaaran ee maanta, laakiin ma sheegto in ay hore u jireen.
*   **B: Dhismayaal ku leh muraayada oo aad uso jiidasho badan** - Dhismayaasha muraayadaha leh waxaa lagu tilmaamaa inay casriyiin yihiin.

Halkan sharraxo si loo fahmo sababaha jawaabaha kale ay sax yihiin:

*   **B: Jawigu wuxuu xasuusin u yahay Turkiga hore:** Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa in magaalada ay leedahay masaajido iyo kaniisado qadiimi ah oo laga dhisay qarnigii 18aad, taasoo ka dhigaysa mid ay ka muuqato taariikhda.

Erayga xanami waxa loola jeedaa eegitaaka waxee?,"The correct answer is **A: Ubaxa cherry-ga**.

The text states that hanami is the ""Daawadashada ubax bixinta geedka cherry"" which translates to ""cherry blossom viewing"". Therefore, hanami refers to the cherry blossoms themselves."
Yaa martigeliyay xafladihii ugu horreeyay ee loogu talagalay daawashada ubaxyada cherry-ga?,"The correct answer is **C: Boqorka Japan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jabaan, markii ugu horeysay xafladaha ubax dilaac ee cherry waxaa qaban jiray **boqorka oo kaliya** iyo xubnaha kale ee reer boqortoyo ee ku harereysan boqortoyada.""  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Boqorka Shiinaha:** The passage mentions the *origin* of the tradition being from China, but not that the Chinese king hosted the first viewing parties.
*   **B: Talisyada qoyska qaniga ah ee Japan:** The passage specifically says only the king and royal family initially held these parties.
*   **D: Talisyada qoyska qaniga ah ee Shiineeska:** Similar to A, this refers to the origin of the tradition, not the initial parties."

Halkan fiiri sababta:

*   Tuducu wuxuu sheegayaa in dalbadaha kale iyo Qaramada Midoobe aysan aqoonsaneyn Jerusalem in ay tahay casimada Israel. Taas awgeed, arintaan waxaa laga yaabaa inay soo jiidato dalxiiska ugu yar.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Waa kuwee nooca socotada ah ee aan ka faa'iidaysan doonin iibsashada Kaarka lagu ciyaaro?","The correct answer is **A: Socotada qorsheynaya inuu booqdo inta SANPark see macquulka ah in la booqdo.**

Here's why:

The text states the Wild Card allows access to *some* or *all* of South Africa's national parks (SANParks). If someone plans to visit many SANParks, the Wild Card is a good value. However, the question asks who *wouldn't* benefit. If someone is only visiting a few, or even just one, they might not save money with the card compared to paying individual entry fees.  Option A is the only one that makes sense because if someone will visit a lot of SANParks, they will benefit. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Socotada booqanaya beerta Qaranka ee Kruger** - The text explicitly states a Wild Card can be beneficial for Kruger National Park.
*   **C: Socotada oo ka walaacsan miisaaniyada khidmadaha beerta booqashada** - A Wild Card can *help* with budgeting by providing upfront access to multiple parks.
*   **D: Socotada qorsheynaya inuu booqdo Beerta Qaranka ee Kruger iyo ugu yaraan hal beer oo kale** - Visiting multiple parks (Kruger + another) makes the Wild Card potentially worthwhile."
Bayaankee ayan si sax ah u qeexaynin Beerta Qaranka ee Kruger?,"The correct answer is **C: Waa mida ugu yar beeraha Qaranka wadanka Koonfur Afrika**.

Here's why:

*   The text states Kruger National Park covers 19,500 km², which is a *large* area, not a small one.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: Waxaa loo tixgaliyaa in aay tahay goobta ugu so jiidashada badan wadanka Koonfur Afrika** - The text states it's ""one of the best game reserves in South Africa"", implying high popularity.
*   **B: Duurjoogta way ku kala duwan yihiin xadiiqadaha badan ee aay leedahay beerta** - The text mentions it comprises ""14 different biomes, each with its own unique wildlife"".
*   **D: Waa ay ku heli karaan booqdayaasha iyaga oo iibsanaayo kaarka iibsashada kaarka lagu ciyaaro** - The text specifically says a Wild Card can be purchased for access to Kruger and other parks.

Kuwan soo socda kee baa ay u badantahay in ay khatar ku tahay dadka fuulaaya meelaha ku yaalla meelaha dhaadheer ee buurta?,"The correct answer is **A: Marka lagu jiro xaaladaha qoyaanka (During rainy conditions)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""gaar ahaan marka ay qoyaan noqoto waxaa laga yaaba iney noqoto qatar sida ugu dhaqsaha badan"" (especially when it is wet, it may be the most dangerous).  This directly links rainy/wet conditions to increased danger.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to be the primary danger:

*   **B: Ku dul socoshada dhagaxa (Walking on stones):** While the path has stone steps, the passage notes they are supported with ropes in difficult areas, implying they are manageable.
*   **C: Gododka yar yar (Small holes):** The passage describes a narrow, short crawl-through, but doesn't present it as a widespread or major hazard.
*   **D: Xadhkaha ka samaysan birta (Steel ropes):** These are *support*, helping people navigate the tricky parts, not a source of danger themselves.

*   Tuducyada qoraalka waxa ku sheegay buurta in ay tahay mid adag oo aad u talaab talaab u socoto, iyo in qoyaan ka dhigto mid khatar ah. Wax kasta oo aad u adkeysanayo waa dhaqaaq oo dhagax yar. Neefta dhagta la heli karo ayaa muujinaysa fayoobka jirka iyo qabowga, laakiin wax ku jira qoraalka ayaa soo jeedinaya.

Halkan sababta jawaabaha kale ay u yihiin mid sax ah:

Maxaa sababi kara aqoonsiga gaarka ah oo laga helo wadaadka ama haweenayda dhowrsoon?,"The correct answer is **A: Xidhashada duub xijaabka jirka daboolaaya kaas oo dhalaalaya** (Wearing a bright, body-covering shawl).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that bringing your *own* shawl, *especially* a bright one, will get you a warm welcome from the Christian scholars. This implies a special recognition for those who go the extra mile and provide their own, visibly distinct covering.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Asturitaanka garbahaaga** (Covering your shoulders): This is a requirement for women, but doesn't lead to *special* recognition.
* **C: Soo amaahashada duubka xijaabka ah ee keniisadda** (Borrowing the church's shawl): The passage implies borrowing isn't as appreciated as bringing your own.  They aren't washed, so there's a negative association.
* **D: Xirashada goonnada ku go’a qaybta ka sarreysa jilibka** (Wearing pants that go above the knee): This is a requirement for men, not a way to receive special recognition.



"
Midkee ka mid ah alaabtan dharka ah soo socota ee aan suurtogalka ahayn in la helo si looga soo amaahdo keniisada? ,"The correct answer is **A: Goonnooyinka (Skirts)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that women are *expected* to bring their own skirts, especially those with a vibrant pattern, to receive a warmer welcome. It implies that the church does provide skirts, but they are unplanned and not readily available.  The other items (buumayaasha/cloaks, surwaallada/trousers, duubabka/head coverings) are all mentioned as being available for loan at the door.

Therefore, skirts are the one item you're encouraged to bring yourself, making it less likely to be available for borrowing.



"
Goorma ayuu booqde heli karaa fursadaha ugu badan ee uu ku daawado xiddigaha marka uu booqanayo goobaha Antarctic?,"The correct answer is **C: Inta lagu jiro bilaha jiilaalka**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that you experience ""polar night"" in Arctic or Antarctic during winter, meaning the sun doesn't rise. This creates very dark skies, ideal for seeing the Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights/Southern Lights) and stars.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Inta lagu jiro bilaha xagaaga:** The passage explicitly links star-gazing to the darkness of winter (polar night), not summer.
*   **B: Marka goobtu aanu aadka u dad badanayn:** While less light pollution helps, the passage emphasizes the darkness of polar night as the primary factor.
*   **D: Marka heerka wasakhowga iftiinka uu hooseeyo:** Again, light pollution is a factor, but the passage focuses on the complete darkness provided by polar night.



"
Goorma ayuu talefanka dayax-gacmeedku noqon doonin beddelka talefanka gacanta?,"The correct answer is **C: Haddii dibadda loo adeegsani ama isticmaali doono**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""maadaama lagaa rabo inaad dibadda u baxdo oo aad isu muuqataan dayax-gacmeedka si aad taleefan u garaacdo."" This means a satellite phone *requires* you to be outdoors and have a clear line of sight to the satellite. Therefore, it won't be a replacement for a mobile phone when you need communication while *indoors* or in situations where you can't go outside.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Haddii khadka aragga ee dayax-gacmeedka uu noqdo mid la hor istaagi karo:** While a clear line of sight is *necessary* for a satellite phone to work, the passage doesn't say this makes it not a replacement. It just means it won't work *at that moment*.
*   **B: Haddii goobtu aad u fog tahay:** The passage states satellite phones are *used* in remote areas, so remoteness doesn't make them a non-replacement.
*   **D: Haddii socdaalka hawsha u baahan yahay xog gaar ah:**  The passage mentions data needs for ships, indicating satellite phones *can* handle data.

"
Goorma ayuu talefanka dayax-gacmeedka uu noqoni lahaa mid laga door bido talefanka gacanta?,"The correct answer is **B: Inta lagu jiro safarka doomaha**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states** that satellite phones are regularly used by ships (including cruise and freight ships) that have a need for data and voice communication. This implies that satellite phones are the preferred method of communication when mobile networks are unavailable, which is common during sea voyages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Marka lagu dalxiisaayo gudaha magaalada** - Mobile networks are readily available in cities, making satellite phones unnecessary.
* **C: Marka xogta fogaanta aan loo baahnayn** - The passage doesn't link satellite phone preference to the *need* for long-distance data; it links it to *lack of availability* of other networks.
* **D: Marka ay u badan tahay in aad haysato talefan gacanta kugu filan warbixin** -  A satellite phone is a solution when a regular cell phone *isn't* sufficient (because of lack of signal).



"
Isku dhacyada soo socda kee baa horseeday abuuritaanka ama aasaaska Jamhuuriyadda Transnistria?,"The correct answer is **B: Qowmiyad (Ethnicity)**.

The text specifically states: ""1994 kii, qilaafkan wuxuu sababay in dawlada iskeeda iskugu dhawaaqday Jamhuuriyada Transnistria ee bariga Moldova... Moldova waa jamhuuriyad qawmiyado badan oo uu haleelay isku dhac qawmiyadeed."" This directly links the creation of Transnistria to ethnic conflict.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dhaqaalaha (Economy):** While economic ties were *re-established*, the conflict itself wasn't *caused* by economic factors according to the text.
*   **C: Luuqad (Language):** The text mentions language use (Romanian and Russian), but doesn't state this as the root cause of the conflict.
*   **D: Diinta (Religion):** Religion is mentioned as a characteristic of Moldova, but doesn't appear to be a factor in the conflict described."
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda ee Jamhuuriyadda Transnistria aay leedahay kaas oo ka duwan dhamaan Moldova inteeda kale?  ,"Jawaabta saxda ah waa **C: Aqoonsiga Qaramada Midoobay**.

Qoraalku si cad u sheegay in Jamhuuriyada Transnistria aysan aqoonsanayn xubnaha Qaramada Midobe, halka Moldova ay tahay mid la aqoonsan yahay. Luuqada, diinta, iyo lacagta waxay leedahay labada qaybood, iyadoo Romanian iyo Orthodox Christianity ay yihiin kuwo caadi ah, iyo lacag gaar ah ay leedahay Transnistria."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Goorma ayay tahay in socotada booqda Montevideo haddii ay rajeynayaan oo aay doonayaan inay ka fogaadaan xaaladaha dabaysha?","The correct answer is **A: Inta lagu jiro bilaha jiilaalka ee nus-dhulka Waqooyiga**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Montevideo is in the southern hemisphere, and experiences summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere.  It also mentions that while temperatures in winter are *usually* not freezing, the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the temperature suggests.  Therefore, to avoid windy conditions, a visitor should go when it's winter in the northern hemisphere (and summer in Montevideo).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Inta lagu jiro xilliga abaarta ah ee Montevideo:** The passage specifically states there isn't a defined dry season (""abaareed"").
* **C: Inta lagu jiro bilaha xagaaga ee nus-dhulka Waqooyiga:** This would be Montevideo's winter, and although not *always* windy, the passage points to winter as the time when wind chill is a significant factor.
* **D: Inta lagu jiro xilliga jiilaalka ah ee Montevideo:** This is when the wind and humidity combine to make the cold feel more intense."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Goorma ayay tahay in socotada booqanayo Montevideo haddii ay qayb ka yihiin cimillada qabow?","The correct answer is **D: Marka ay jiilaalku tahay nus-dhulka Waqooyiga**.

Here's why:

The text states that Montevideo is in the southern hemisphere. It also states that when it's winter in the northern hemisphere, it's summer in Montevideo.  Since the question asks when someone who enjoys cold weather should visit, the answer is when it's winter in the northern hemisphere (and therefore summer in Montevideo - the opposite season).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Marka ay tahay xagaaga Montevideo** - This is when it's *hot* in Montevideo, not cold.
*   **B: Marka ay xagaagu tahay nus-dhulka Waqooyiga** - This is winter in Montevideo.
*   **C: Marka ay tahay xilli-roobaadka Montevideo** - The text says there isn't a specific rainy season with consistent rainfall, so this isn't a reliable indicator of cold weather."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, midka soo socda ayaa la xidhiidhi doona farshaxanka waxa sawirka oo la aasaasay, oo ka soo horjeeda burburinta?","The correct answer is **A: Dhacdooyinka sawirada farshaxanka**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions ""sawirlayaal farshaxan xirfadleh, xaflado farshaxan iyo gidaaro “sharci” ah.""** This directly relates to the *creation* of artwork. The question asks for something connected to the *establishment* of artwork, which is the opposite of vandalism.
* **Let's look at why the other options are wrong:**
    * **B: Loo qoraaya si aan taxadar lahayn (Writing carelessly):** This doesn't relate to artwork.
    * **C: Sawirro aan loo baahnayn oo ku yaal hantida dadweynaha (Unwanted images on public property):** This refers to *vandalism*, which is the opposite of what the question asks for.  The passage even notes that many associate graffiti with vandalism.
    * **D: Calaamadaha aan la aqoonsan karin (Unidentifiable signs):** This is too vague and doesn't connect to the creation of art.

Waa maxay noocee xafladaha muusiga ayay ka-qaybgalayaasha qaarkood u haystaan ​​inay qayb muhiim ah ka yihiin waayo-aragnimada?,"The correct answer is **B: Wada joogitaanka goobta**.

The passage states: ""...badiyaa inta joogta munasibadaha musikadu waxay go'aansadaan inay ku nastaan goobta, badiyaa ka qaybgaleyaashu waxay u tixgaliyaan inay tahay qayb muhiim ah oo khibrad laga helo."" This directly translates to attendees considering *staying at the venue* an important part of the experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Keenida caruurta yaryarka ah** - The passage mentions family activities, but doesn't say attendees consider *bringing children* a key part of the experience.
*   **C: Musiga socoto am shidan goor dambe oo habeenkii** - While the passage *mentions* music continuing late, it doesn't say attendees see this as the key part of the experience, only that it may happen.
*   **D: So galitaanka xiliga hore** - The passage suggests arriving early for a good spot, but doesn't state this is considered an essential part of the overall experience.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaa la gudboon ka qaybqaataha xafladaha inay mudnaanta siiyaan haddii ay rabaan inay dagaan goobta u dhow muusigga?","The correct answer is **D: So galitaanka xiliga hore** (Entering early).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hadii aad dooneysid inaad u dhawaatid halka ay waxa ka dhacayaan, waa inaad waqti hore aad tagtid goob xeer dhigasho ee u dhaw muusikada.""  This directly translates to: ""If you want to be close to where the music is happening, you need to go to a designated area early.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Soo daahitaanka habeenkii** (Staying late) - The text mentions music continuing into the night, but not as a way to get a good spot.
*   **B: La joogitaanka goobta xubnaha qoyska** (Staying with family members) - The text mentions family activities, but doesn't link that to getting closer to the music.
*   **C: Goobta ka fog goobta xerada ah** (Far from the camping area) - The text implies the opposite - you need to go *near* the music area.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Halkee ayay tahay in booqdayaashu ay iska ilaaliyaan markay raadinayaan nolol cawaysnimo waqooyiga New Mexico?","The correct answer is **B: Baararka yar-yar magaalada**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hal markii loo eego, waqooyiga New Mexico ayaa dhibaatooyin badan ku qabaan ku waditaanka baaburka sarqaanka, iyo darawalada sarqaansan ayaa ku badan baararka magaalooyinka yar yar."" This directly warns about the problems associated with small-town bars in northern New Mexico, specifically relating to drunk driving.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pueblos:** The passage doesn't mention anything negative about pueblos.
*   **C: Suuqyada:** The passage doesn't mention markets at all.
*   **D: Goobaha lagu ciyaaro khamaarka:** The passage indicates casinos offer entertainment, not that they are places to avoid.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, halkee waaye halka booqduhu ay u badan tahay in uu ka helo madadaalo caan ah ee waqooyiga New Mexico?","The correct answer is **A: Ku sugnaanaya laba sacaadood goobta lagu ciyaaro ee magalada Albuquerque**.

Here's why:

The passage states that most casinos listed ""have drinks, and several bring in name entertainment (often bigger names closer to Albuquerque and Santa Fe)."" It specifically mentions that to find entertainment, you often need to travel to Albuquerque or Santa Fe. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Meel fog pueblo:** The passage doesn't suggest entertainment is readily available in remote pueblos.
* **C: Goobta ciyaaraha ee u dhaw Sante Fe:** While Santa Fe is mentioned as a location for entertainment, the passage doesn't emphasize casinos *near* Santa Fe specifically.
* **D: Joogaya maqaaxidaha yar yar ee magaalada:** The passage explicitly warns that small-town bars often have problems and are not ideal for visitors seeking entertainment.

Safarrada ka taxadara miisaaniyada ayaa laga yaabaa inay rabaan inay iska ilaaliyaan nooca cabitaanka?,"The correct answer is **A: Khamriga Australia**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Markii loo eego Australian-ka, ray'iga kafee 'oo wada cad’ ayaa ajnabi ku ah."" This implies that Australians have specific, and potentially more expensive, preferences when it comes to drinks (like wanting espresso instead of a 'long black'). The text then highlights that juice/fruit drinks are ""heersare balse waa qaali"" (high quality but expensive). Therefore, a budget traveler would likely avoid Australian wines (and potentially other Australian drinks) to save money.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Biyo dhalada kujira:** The passage says local spring water is ""aad bay ugu habboon"" (very suitable), meaning it's a good, readily available option.
* **C: biirka deegaanka lagu sameeyo:** The passage mentions local beers are ""si hawl yarbaa loo heli karaa"" (easily available), not that they are expensive.
* **D: Casiirka ama cabitaanka miraha:** While mentioned as expensive, the passage doesn't directly link it to avoiding it for budget travel, unlike the specific example of Australian drink preferences.



"
"Iyadoo lagu salaynayo aagga lagu sifeeyay tuducda, keebaa kamid ah dalabaadka soo socda ee cabitaanka ay u badan tahay inuu ku wareero kabalyeeriga?","The correct answer is **A: Madow mudadiisa gaabantahay (Short black)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Markii loo eego Australian-ka, ray'iga kafee 'oo wada cad’ ayaa ajnabi ku ah. Koobka gaaban oo madaw ayaa ‘espresso’ ah..."" This means ordering a black coffee (specifically a short black/espresso) would be unfamiliar and therefore likely cause confusion for the barista in this setting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nambarka Koowaad (Number One):** This is identified as the most important local drink, so it would be a common request.
* **C: Khamriga Sauvignon Blanc oo ka yimid New Zealand (Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand):** The passage suggests New Zealand wines are good for travelers, implying they are available and acceptable.
* **D: Caddaan fidsan (Flat White):** While the passage points out that ""flat whites"" aren't the norm, it doesn't suggest it would cause confusion – only that it's not typical.



"
"Isaga oo qaatay mudo saddex qarni ah, kooxee baa bilaawday xilligii gumeysiga?","The correct answer is **D: Isbaanishka**.

The passage states: ""Dadka Spain ayaa bilaabay xiligii guumaysiga oo socday saddex qarni."" This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Payaguá** - The passage mentions they were an indigenous group living in the Chaco region.
*   **B: Guaycurú** -  Also mentioned as an indigenous group in the Chaco region.
*   **C: Guraani** -  Described as the original, most important indigenous group in eastern Paraguay.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, waa maxay habka ugu wanaagsan ee lagu heli karo Parisian si uu kuugu diiriyo?","The correct answer is **C: Edeb u dhaqan** (Good manners).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the best way to navigate Paris and be well-received is to act like someone ""bien élevé"" which directly translates to ""well-mannered"" or having good etiquette. The passage emphasizes being respectful and avoiding rudeness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Isku day inaad ku daydaan dabeecadda Parisian:** While understanding Parisian culture is helpful, the passage doesn't say to *pretend* to *be* Parisian, but rather to *behave* in a polite and respectful way.
* **B: Soo saar kalsoonida:** Confidence isn't mentioned as a key factor in the passage.
* **D: Muuji dabeecad qallafsan:** The passage states Parisians are known for being critical and the opposite of agreeable - so showing a rough demeanor would be counterproductive.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Kuwan soo socda kee baa loo tixgalinayn tayada cakiran ee Parisians?","Jawabka saxda ah waa **B: Edab darnaan**.

Halkan sababta:

* Waxa kale oo lagu sheegay in ""habka ugu fiican ee la joogi doona habka ugu ficanna lagu waari karo Paris, waa in la iska dhigo qof kaas oo “bien élevé” (hab dhaqan fican)"".  Taas macnaheedu waa edabka ayaa muhiim ka ah in la iska dhiso xiriir wanaagsan.

Waa maxay faa'iidada Heerka Koowaad ee MetroRail ee Cape Town?,"The correct answer is **B: Ma aha sida dad badan**.

Here's why:

The passage states that MetroPlus (First Level) is ""more comfortable and less crowded"" than Metro (Third Level). This directly translates to ""Ma aha sida dad badan"" in Somali, meaning ""It is not as crowded"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tababaruhu waxa uu joogaa afaafka hore ee tareenka** (The trainer is at the front of the train) - The passage does not mention anything about trainers or where they are located.
*   **C: Aad qaali uma ahaa iibsashada tigidhka heerka saddexaad** (It wasn't expensive to buy a third-level ticket) - The passage states MetroPlus is slightly more expensive than Metro, not the other way around.
*   **D: Waxay la mid tahay qiimaha tigidhka Metro** (It is the same price as a Metro ticket) - The passage states MetroPlus is *more* expensive than Metro.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, muxuu haystaa tareen kasta oo dadka aay shaqada u raacan oo ku sugan Cape Town?","Jawaabta saxda ah waa **D: Labada tababare ee fasalka koowaad iyo saddexaad**.

Sababta:

Qoraalka ayaa si cad u sheegaya in ""tareen walbo ayaa qabaa qaybta Metroplus iyo Metro"" waxaana sidoo kale tilmaamaya in MetroPlus (fasalka koowaad) iyo Metro (fasalka saddexaad) ay yihiin labada heer ee jira.

Habeenka kale ee jawaabaha ayaa ah mid aan sax ahayn:

*   **A:** Qoraalka kama sheegayo dad badnaanta kooxaha Metro.
*   **B:** Qoraalka ayaa tilmaamaya in qiimaha tigidhada ay kala duwan yihiin.
*   **C:** Qoraalka ayaa sheegaya kaliya laba heer, ma ahan saddex."
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda ayaa ah cayayaan xayawaan ah aan laga yaabin inuu sameeyo?,"Jawbta saxda ah waa **D: Wuxuu sababaa dhaawac aad u halis ah**.

Sabab: Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa in cayayaanka yaryar ee noolaha ku dulnool awood u yeeshaan inay dhaawacaan ama dilaan dadka, laakiin inta badan looma kala saaro cayayaan ahaan. Taas macnaheeda ah in cayayaanku awood u yeelan karaan dhaawac aad u halis ah, taasoo ka dhigaysa midda ugu macquulsan ee ay sameeyaan.

Halkan waxaa ah sababta jawaabaha kale aanay ku habboonayn:

*   **A: Wuxuu keena ama uu sababaa inay finan kaso baxaan:** Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa in cayayaanku sababi karaan cuncun, taas oo keeni karta finan, laakiin ma sheegayo in sababta ugu badan ee ay cayayaanku sameeyaan waa finan.
*   **B: Wuxuu kiciyaa xasaasiyada:** Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa in cayayaanku sababi karaan xaalado xunxun, taas oo laga yaabaa inay xasaasiyad ku jiraan, laakiin ma sheegayo in tani ay tahay midda ugu badan.
*   **C: Wuuxuu faafiyaa caabuqa:** Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa in cayayaanku gudbiyaan caabuqyo, taasoo macnaheedu waa faafiyaan, laakiin ma sheegayo in tani ay tahay midda ugu badan."
Xagee laga iibsan karaa kaadhadhka taleefoonada ee hore loo bixiyay?,"The correct answer is **C: Koonaha Dukaamada** (Corners of shops).

The passage states: ""Dukaan kasta waxa ka kiilan taleefano kaadhadh ku shubasho oo talefoon..."" which translates to ""Every shop sells prepaid phone cards...""  Therefore, you'd find them at the corners/sections of shops.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wadamo gaar ah** (Specific countries) - The passage mentions cards specializing in calls to specific countries, but doesn't say that's where you *buy* them.
*   **B: Saldhigyada tareenada** (Train stations) - Not mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Telefoonada dadweynaha** (Public telephones) - The passage actually suggests using these *with* a free phone number to avoid charges, not to buy cards.



"
Sidee loo helaa qiimaha wacitaanka ee kaadhadhka qaarkood?,"The correct answer is **A: Waxa kaliya oo laga isticmaali karaa dalal gaar ah**

Here's why:

The text states: ""...kuwa qaar ayaa ku takhasuso inay koox wadamo gaar ah qiimo jaban lagu waco."" This directly translates to ""some cards specialize in making calls to a specific group of countries at a low price.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Iyada oo loo marayo lambarro lacag-la'aan ah** - While the text mentions free numbers, it doesn't say these cards *require* them to get a good price.
*   **C: Dukaanka geeska** - The text says you can *buy* the cards at shops, but doesn't say this is how you find the price.
*   **D: Adigoo isticmaalaya telefoonada dad waynaha oo bixinaya kharash dheeraad ah** - This is not mentioned in the text.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Geedaha soo socda kee baa ku yar beerta qaranka ee Plitvice Lakes?","The correct answer is **A: Geedka Beech-ka**.

The text specifically states that beech trees are among the most common trees in Plitvice Lakes National Park (""inta badan geedaha afka qalaad lagu dhaho beech...""). The other options (oak, beroosh, and spruce) are not mentioned as being prominent in the park. While spruce *is* mentioned, beech is highlighted as being *most* common."
Xayawaannada naadirka ah ee soo socda keebaa laga heli karaa beerta qaranka ee Plitvice Lakes?,"The correct answer is **D: Shimbirta Capercaillie** (Capercaillie).

The text specifically mentions ""shimbirlaaye"" which translates to Capercaillie, as one of the rare animals found in the Plitvice Lakes National Park.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shimbirta turki (Turkey)** - The text doesn't mention turkeys.
*   **B: Xayawaanka Badger-ka malabka (Honey Badger)** - The text mentions ""barawnka Yurubiyaanka"" (European brown bear) and ""badger-ka waaweyn"" (large badger), not honey badgers specifically.
*   **C: Shimbirta Cassowary** - Cassowaries are native to Australia and New Guinea, and wouldn't be found in a European national park.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxay kode-yada gobolku ka caawiyaan?","The correct answer is **B: Xakamaynta suuqa (Market control)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the *real* purpose of these codes is to allow companies to ""heavily manage their markets"" and that it's ""just money transfer.""  It's a way for the companies to control how their products are distributed and used, not to prevent copying or piracy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Koobiyaynta diskka (Disk copying):** The passage says the codes *don't* affect illegal copying.
* **C: Ka hortagga budhcad-badeedda (Preventing piracy):** The passage argues the codes are not actually effective at stopping illegal copying.
* **D: Koobiyayn sharci darro ah (Illegal copying):** Again, the passage states these codes have no effect on illegal copying.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Kuwan soo socda keebaa been ka sheegaya xeer-hoosaadka gobolka ee ay wadaan shirkadaha warbaahintu?","The correct answer is **C: Waxay faa'iido u leeyihiin wareejinta lacagta** (They benefit from money transfer).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""U jeedada saxda ah ayaa ah in shirkadani aad loogu maamulo suuqyadooda; kaliya waa lacag wareejin."" (The true purpose is for these companies to manage their markets highly; it's only a money transfer).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waxay lagama maarmaan u yihiin helitaanka koontaroolka suuqa oo badan** (They are essential for gaining more market control) - While the passage mentions market control, it frames it as a *result* of the money transfer, not the primary purpose.
*   **B: Waxay kaa caawinayaan ka fogaanshaha nuqulka sharci darrada ah** (They help you avoid copyright infringement) - The passage directly refutes this, stating the codes have no effect on illegal copying.
*   **D: Waa dhif inay caawiyaan ka hortagga burcad-badeednimada** (They barely help prevent piracy) - The passage implies they do not help with preventing piracy at all.

Therefore, option C most accurately reflects the central claim of the passage about the true motivation behind these media companies' actions."
"Markaad imaanaysa dhulkaaga hooyo, habkee baa caadiyan aan rasmi ahayn?","The correct answer is **D: Kontoroolka kastamka** (Customs control).

Here's why:

* **The passage directly discusses Customs (waaxda kaantaroolka cashuuraha) as being potentially problematic upon returning to your country.** It emphasizes knowing what you can and cannot bring and declaring everything exceeding legal limits – all duties of customs.
* **A (Immigration check):** While important, the passage says immigration checks are *missing or inadequate*.
* **B (Confirmation of belongings):** This is too general. Customs specifically focuses on the *legal limits* of belongings.
* **C (Legal limit of belongings):** This is *part* of what customs deals with, but not the whole process.  Customs *enforces* the legal limits.

Therefore, the question is asking what is commonly *unofficial* (or prone to issues as the passage suggests) upon returning home, and Customs control fits that description in the context of the provided text."
Kuwan soo socda keebaa habboon inaad ogaato ka hor intaadan iman dalkaagi?,"The correct answer is **B: Haddii aad u baahan tahay inaad ku dhawaaqdo shay ka badan xadka sharciga ah**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states, ""Hubso inaad ogtahay waxa aad soo qaadan karto iyo waxa aadan soo qaadan karin kuna dhawaaqwax kasta oo ka baxsan xadka sharciga.""  This directly relates to needing to declare items exceeding legal limits.

Let's look at why the other options are less directly relevant:

*   **A: Haddii ay jiri doonto isbaaro socdaalka ah:** While important, the passage focuses on customs, not general immigration checks.
*   **C: Haddii ay jiri doonto xakamaynta kastamka:** This is a general statement, the passage is about *what to declare* *during* customs control, not just if it will happen.
*   **D: Haddii uu jiro shay aan la oggolayn oo aad keenayso:** Knowing what's prohibited is good, but the passage specifically emphasizes declaration of *over-limit* items."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Waa maxay faa'iidada u oggolaanaysa fuulayaasha inay si joogto ah u ogaadaan dariiqyo cusub oo gudaha Dooxada Cochamó ah?","The correct answer is **D: Darbiyada** (The cliffs).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that climbers are ""constantly establishing new routes *along its endless cliffs*.""  This means the abundance and nature of the cliffs are what allow for continuous exploration and the creation of new routes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aragtida** (The view): While the view is mentioned as being attractive, it doesn't *enable* climbers to find new routes.
*   **B: Shirarka** (Meetings): The passage doesn't mention anything about meetings.
*   **C: Meesha ugu sarreysa** (The highest place): While the highest points have good views, the cliffs themselves are the key feature."
"Iyadoo lagu salaynayo macluumaadka lagu sheegay tuduca, yaa daboolaya isgoysyada ugu badan ee nus-dhuleedka Koonfureed?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The text states that Star Alliance ""covers everything except the eastern South Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti"". This means they have the most extensive network across the Southern Hemisphere, covering *almost* the entire region.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: SkyTeam:** The text explicitly states SkyTeam doesn't cross any of the three major oceanic routes in the Southern Hemisphere.
*   **C: South Pacific:** This is a geographical area, not an airline alliance.
*   **D: LATAM Oneworld:** This alliance only serves one specific route (Santiago de Chile to Tahiti) and is described as the *only* option for that limited route, meaning its coverage is very narrow.



"
Isbahaysigee diyaaradeed ayaa daboolaya inta ugu yar ee ka gudubka badda ee nus-dhulka Koonfureed?,"The correct answer is **A: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Star Alliance covers everything *except* the route from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti. This implies they have the most extensive coverage of the Southern Hemisphere, minimizing sea crossings. 

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **South Pacific:** This isn't a defined airline alliance mentioned in the text.
*   **LATAM Oneworld:** This only covers *one* specific route (Santiago to Tahiti) and is explicitly identified as a limitation, not a comprehensive solution.
*   **SkyTeam:** The passage specifically states SkyTeam doesn't cross *any* of the three major ocean routes in the Southern Hemisphere, making it the least comprehensive option.

Therefore, Star Alliance is the alliance that covers the most ground with the fewest sea crossings."
Waa kuwee ururka dalxiiska ee ku guulaystay Dalxiiska Orodka Caalamiga ah?,"The correct answer is **B: Tag Dalxiiska Orodka**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Guusha Socdaallada Caalamiga ah ee Dunida, Go Running Tours ayaa leh kumanaan bixiyeyaal indhoolayaal ah oo jooga afarta qaaradood.""  ""Go Running Tours"" translates to ""Tag Dalxiiska Orodka"" in Somali. Therefore, it is the organization that achieved success in World Running Tours.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Immisa hay'adood oo indho-indhayn ah oo kala duwan ayuu tartanka dalxiisayaasha ee Go Running uu ka caawiya inay isku xidhmaan?","The correct answer is **C: Wax badan**.

Here's why:

The passage states Go Running Tours has ""thousands of local guides operating on four continents."" This means they connect with *many* different guides. While we don't know the exact number, ""thousands"" clearly indicates ""wax badan"" (many/more than a few).

Let's look at why the other answers are incorrect:

*   **A: Afar (Four):** While the guides are on four continents, this doesn't tell us how many *individual* guides there are.
*   **B: 200:** This is the total number of tourism organizations mentioned, not the number of guides Go Running works with.
*   **D: Saddex (Three):** The text doesn't mention three guides."

Here's why:

The text states: ""Libaaxyada, Haramacadyada iyo Shabeeladda mararka qaar way qajilaan waxaadna si wacan oogu arki kartaa diirad.""  and ""Socodka safari (sidoo kale na loo yaqaano socodka duurka”, “socodka safari”, ama ku bixitaanka “lugta”) ayaa koobo socodka oo dhawr saacadood ama dhawr maalmood."" This implies that walking safaris offer a better chance to see predators like cheetahs at close range.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Inuu kuso socdo duurka** - This is just another way of saying ""safari socod ah"" but isn't as specific.
*   **C: Inuu Isticmaalo muraayadaha indhaha** - While binoculars can help, they don't guarantee a better *viewing opportunity* of a cheetah.
*   **D: Baabuur qaado oo isticmaal qalabka caadiga ah** - The text mentions animals getting close to vehicles, but doesn't suggest it's the *best* way to see cheetahs clearly."
"Sida ku salaysan tuduca, noocee ah xayawaan ah ayaa laga yaabaa in booqduhu uu la kulmo inta lagu jiro safarka safari ee gaariga?","The correct answer is **B: Geriyada**

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Xayawaanada qaar, sida **maroodiyada iyo geriyada**, ayaa isku daya inay ku soo dhawaadaan baabuurta...""  This indicates giraffes are likely to be encountered on a safari drive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Libaaxyo:** The text says lions *sometimes* rest in view, but doesn't say they actively approach vehicles.
*   **C: Shaweelada:** The text does mention cheetahs (shabeelada) but does not say they approach the vehicle
*   **D: Haramcadyada:** The text says Haramacadyada can be seen resting, but doesn’t say they approach the vehicles.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaa hoos u dhigi karo kharashka dalxiiska?","The correct answer is **B: Helitaanka koox afar ah**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that forming groups of four to six people can result in a better per-person cost (""...isku day inaad la kulantaan dad kale una samaysaan kooxo afar ilaa lix ah si aad u heshaan kharash qofeed kan ka fiican."").  The text contrasts this with travelling alone or with just one companion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Adiga kaligaa aadaayo** - The passage says travelling alone is *less* favorable.
*   **C: La socdaalaya qof kale** - The passage says this is also not ideal and to aim for a larger group.
*   **D: Helitaanka koox ka kooban lix ama ka badan** - While a group of this size might also be okay, the passage specifically highlights *four to six* as the sweet spot for better costs.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, yaa ay u badan tahay inuu xaqiijiyo heerka dalxiiska ugu fiican?","The correct answer is **A: Dalxiisayaal doonaya in ay kala badashaan baabuurta**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that tour operators often *change* people around in vehicles, seemingly to overcharge.  Therefore, the people most likely to experience the *worst* deal (and thus need to be aware and potentially avoid this situation) are those willing to share vehicles with strangers. The passage advises forming your own group to avoid this, implying those who *don't* do that are more vulnerable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Koox saddex ah:** The passage *recommends* groups of 4-6, not 3.
*   **C: Laba saaxiib oo wada socda:**  The passage suggests forming a larger group *from* a starting point of one or two people.
*   **D: Koox shan ah:** While a group of 5 *would* get better rates, they aren't the ones being warned about potential scams, they are the ones *avoiding* it.

The text states, ""Ka soo muuqashadeeda badan ee muusikada, filimada, suugaanta iyo dhaqamada caanka ah waxay magaalada iyo muuqaaladeeda ka caawisay in laga aqoonsada caalamka oo dhan.""  This directly points to the influence of art and media in making San Francisco globally recognized.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Goobaha shirarka ugu sarreeya:** The text mentions key employment sectors but doesn't highlight conferences as a reason for global recognition.
* **C: Kala duwanaanshaha dhaqaale:** While the text mentions the diversified economy, it doesn't say that this *caused* the city's global recognition.
* **D: Goob cusub oo hada la saamaynaayo oo ah goob cunto Aasiyaan:** The text states that San Francisco is known for Asian cuisine, but that's a result *of* its character, not the cause of its global fame.

*   The text states San Francisco's economy is *diversified* and lists several major employment sectors (services, downloads, finance, commerce, and tourism). It doesn't say the economy *entirely* relies on tourism.
*   **A** is true: The text explicitly mentions its prominent appearance in music, film, literature, and popular culture.
*   **B** is true: The text states it's one of the best places in the country for Asian cuisine.
*   **C** is true: The text mentions a ""broad range of luxury hotels, restaurants, and very high-end services."" This implies the presence of many hotels and conference facilities.

Therefore, option D is the only one that contradicts the information given in the text."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Waa maxay nooca socotada ah ee aan laga yaabin in uu ka faa'iidaysto isticmaalka adeegyada wakiilka socdaalka?","The correct answer is **D: Socotada doorbidaya heshiisyada xirmada ballansashada** (Travelers who prefer package deals).

Here's why:

* The text specifically mentions that travel agents often offer ""adeegyo isku xiran oo ka kooban quraac, gaadiid kaa soo / kuu qaadaya madaarka ama xitaa duulimaad iyo hudheelkii oo wada socda"" (interconnected services including breakfast, airport transfers, or even flight and hotel packages). This directly appeals to travelers who like the convenience and potential cost savings of a package deal.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Socotada aan go'aan lahayn** (Undecided travelers) - While a travel agent *can* help undecided travelers, the text doesn't highlight this as a primary benefit.
* **B: Socotada u nugul u janjeeritaanka** (Flexible travelers) -  Flexibility isn't really emphasized. The text is more about convenience and pre-arranged details.
* **C: Socotada aan weli helin fiisahooda** (Travelers who haven't yet obtained their visas) -  The text mentions visa assistance as *one* service, but it's not the main focus or the primary type of traveler likely to benefit.



"
Kuwan soo socda midkee aan lagu xusin tuducda inuu yahay faa'iidada laga helo iskadiwaangalinta loo maro wakiilka safarka?,"The correct answer is **D: U boos qabashada ama ceelinta** (Booking or cancelling).

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly mentions:**
    * **Heshiisyada hoteelada (Hotel agreements):** ""Wakiilada shirkadaha safaradu waxay badiyaa heshiisyo la galaan huteelo khaas ah...""
    * **Baakadaha loo wada dhan yahay (Package deals):** ""Wakiilada safaradu badanaa waxay bixiyaa adeegyo isku xiran oo ka kooban quraac, gaadiid kaa soo / kuu qaadaya madaarka ama xitaa duulimaad iyo hudheelkii oo wada socda.""
    * **Dukumeentiyada socdaalka oo degdeg ah (Expedited travel documents):** ""...kuu samayn karaan diyaar garaw hadii aad u baahantahay aad kaga fikirto bixinta ama soo saarista dhugmatiga aad ku tagayso (sida fiisaha).""

* **U boos qabashada ama ceelinta (Booking or cancelling)** is not specifically mentioned as a benefit of using a travel agent. While agents *can* handle bookings and cancellations, the text doesn't highlight it as a *primary* advantage of their services.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, waa maxay waxa aanay aaladaha turjumaanka qoraalka ee wakhtiga-dhabta awoodin?","The correct answer is **D: Sida saxda ah u turjumida 100% waqtiga saxda ah**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Mishiinada turjumistu aad bay uga soo reeyeen, haddana waxay soo saaraan turjumis ku dhawaad sax ah (oo marar dhif ah waxaan la fahmayn ah), balse daryeel ayaa soo socda, maadaama laga yaabo weli inay waxoo dhanba khaldaan.""  This directly indicates that even though translation machines have improved, they **cannot** translate perfectly and make mistakes. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Turjumidda calaamadaha ku qoran luqadaha shisheeye** - The text *specifically* says these machines *can* translate text from signs and objects using a phone's camera.
*   **B: Turjumaada dhamaan qaybaha qoraalka** - The text doesn't mention limitations on *what* types of text they can translate, only the *accuracy* of the translation.
*   **C: Ku turjumida qoraalka walxaha iyada oo la isticmaalaayo telefoonka casriga ah** -  The text explicitly states these machines *can* do this.



"
Maxaa ogolaanaya turjumaada in lagu sameeyo qaab intarnet la’aan ah ama oflayn?,"The correct answer is **C: Soo dejinta xogta luqadda**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Google Translate, kaasoo ogolaada turjumista bilaa khadka ah ka dib markaad la soo degto xogta luqadaad rabto."" (Google Translate, which allows offline translation after you download the language data you want.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Qadadka turjumaadka ee la horumariyay (Developed translation lines):** This is a vague term not directly linked to offline functionality in the text.
*   **B: Taleefannada casriga ah (Smartphones):** Smartphones are the *device* used, but not what enables offline translation.
*   **D: Codsiyada ku jira qaybta turjumaadda-waqtiga dhabta ah (Applications in the real-time translation section):** These apps usually *require* an internet connection."
Kuwa soo socda kee baa aan kicinaynin ama aan keenaynin baraf badan?,"The correct answer is **A: Baraf isku dheg dhegan** (Compact snow).

Here's why:

The passage explains that avalanches happen when snow is *loose* and needs a trigger to fall. Compact, or packed, snow is less likely to avalanche because it's already stable and doesn't easily slide.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Aadanaha** (Humans) - The passage explicitly states humans can be triggers (""badaan qaar aadami ah"").
*   **C: Iftiinka Qorraxda** (Sunlight) - Sunlight can cause snow to melt and create unstable conditions, leading to avalanches (the passage mentions ""diirimaadka barafka"" - melting snow).
*   **D: Baraf dheeraad ah oo da'aya** (Additional falling snow) - This is *exactly* what the passage says can trigger an avalanche (""baraf dheeraada oo soo dhaca"").



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Kuwa soo socda kee baa u soo dhaca sida barafka?","The correct answer is **C: Mugga barafka oo xad dhaaf ah oo ku yaal qaybaha dhaadheer ee buurta**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that glaciers (daadadka) have a lot of ice and ""wixii ku dheeraadana way soo butaacinayaan"" (and they shed the excess). This ""excess"" is described as breaking off and causing further ice to fall.
*   The passage also mentions that the problem is the ice is unstable and needs something to trigger a fall, which then triggers more ice to fall. This describes a large mass of ice on mountains.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baraf isku dhegdhegan oo wali kicin oo aad ahayn** (Compact snow that hasn’t significantly moved) - The passage is about glaciers, not just snow, and focuses on *falling* ice.
*   **B: Qaybaha dhaadheer ee buurta oo aan baraf lahayn** (Tall parts of the mountain without snow) - The passage is *about* the ice *on* these parts of the mountain.
*   **D: Baraf aanan bini aadamka wali uusan taabanin** (Ice that humans haven’t touched yet) - This isn't relevant to the description of what causes the ice to fall.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Waa kuwee maaddooyinka laga sameeyo curry-ga oo ah cunto aad u macaan?","The correct answer is **C: Caanaha qumbaha iyo hilibka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Koonfurta Hindiya iyo gobollada kale ee xeebta ee aaggaa, caanaha qumbaha ayaa badanaa la isticmaalaa."" and ""Curry ayaa cunto ka samaysan...hilib ama khudaar."" 

While other ingredients are mentioned, coconut milk and meat/vegetables are specifically highlighted as being used to make curry, especially in certain regions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Caanaha Yogurt-ka iyo Biyo:** While yogurt can be used, it's mentioned as a base for sauces in North India/Pakistan, not specifically for a sweet curry.
*   **B: Dhirta qudaarta iyo dhirta udgoon badan:** This is too broad. The passage says 'dhir cuntada' which is vague.
*   **D: Qudaarta iyo caano:** Again, too broad. The passage doesn’t specify that all curries use both vegetables and milk.



"
waa kuwee maadada kujirto curry-ga ee mararka qaarkooda la isticmaalaa si loogu badalo caanaha qumbaha gobolada qaarkood?,"The correct answer is **C: Caanaha Yogurt-ka**.

The text states: ""Gobollada gudaha ee Waqooyiga Hindiya iyo Baakistaan, Suusaca waxaa badanaa looga isticmaalaa suugo ahaan; Koonfurta Hindiya iyo gobollada kale ee xeebta ee aaggaa, caanaha qumbaha ayaa badanaa la isticmaalaa.""  This directly says yogurt (suusaca) is used *instead* of coconut milk in some regions.
"
Waa maxay sababta u leexashada agagaarka buurtaTransantarctic aay ugu baahantahay in la tago dhulka fidsan?,"The correct answer is **C: Cagaf-cagafyada khaaska ah maaha kuwo jilicsan**.

Here's why:

The passage states the route ""waa aad ugu wareegtaa Buuraleyda Transantarctic si ay u soo korto taagga"". This implies the route deviates to avoid difficult terrain.  The text also explains the route can *only* be traversed by specific tracked vehicles that aren't very maneuverable. Therefore, the winding route around the mountains is necessary because these vehicles can't easily navigate steep or complex terrain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Saldhigga McMurdo ayaa inta badan xiran:** The passage doesn't mention anything about McMurdo station being closed.
* **B: Barafka isku dhag dhagay khatar ayu leeyahay:** While crevasses *are* mentioned, the passage doesn't say the mountain route is specifically to avoid crevasse fields.
* **D: Way ka sahlan tahay inaad ku safarto badda Ross:** The passage doesn't suggest the route is easier, just that it goes around the mountains.



"
maxaa lagu summeeyay calamada ku teedsan dariiqa cirifka koonfureed?,"The correct answer is **C: dildilaacyada dhul barafeedka ee uu barafka ka buuxo**.

Here's why:

The passage states the route is ""marked by flags."" It also describes the route as being through a landscape with ""crevasses"" (which are cracks in the ice).  Therefore, the flags are used to mark and warn about these dangerous crevasses. ""Dildilaacyada dhul barafeedka ee uu barafka ka buuxo"" directly translates to ""crevasses"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waddada ku taal Saldhigga McMurdo** - This refers to the starting point, not what the flags mark.
*   **B: Cagaf-cagafyada ku raran shidaalka** - The passage mentions the vehicles that *use* the road, but not that the flags mark them.
*   **D: Waddooyinka khatarta ah ee ku wareegsan buuraha** - While the route goes near mountains, the passage doesn't state the flags specifically mark mountain hazards.



"
Maxaan tuduca lagu xusin wax ay tahay in dalxiisayaashu ogaadaan marka ay u sahaminayaan Koonfurta Afrika?,"The correct answer is **A: In wadamada kala duwani ay qabaan shuruudo kala duwan oo dhanka fiisaha ah**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states: ""Shuruudaha dal-ku-galka iyo qarashkuba way ku kala duwan yihiin waddamada waxaana saameynaya waddanka aad ka imanayso."" (Visa requirements and costs vary by country and are affected by your country of origin).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** While the passage mentions exploring off the beaten path, it doesn't *emphasize* this as something travelers *need to know*.
*   **C:** The passage directly contradicts this by stating: ""Maskaxda ku hay in inkastoo Koonfurta Afrika ay degan tahay, wadamada la deriska oo dhan ma degana."" (Keep in mind that while South Africa is stable, not all neighboring countries are).
*   **D:** This is mentioned, but it's a recommendation about vehicle type, not a *requirement* that travelers need to be aware of for entry.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaa loo qaadan karaa in aay tahay tala xun oo la siiyo dalxiisayaasha raadinaya inay Koonfurta Afrika ku sahamiyaan ayaga oo isticmaalaya baabuur?","The correct answer is **A: Waxyaalaha degdega ah ee gaadhiga dhexdiisa ayaa laga yaabaa inuu u baahdo sharci**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Waddan kasta sidoo kale waxa uu leeyahay shuruuc cusub oo sheegaya ashayaada degdeg ah ee ay tahay in gaariga ay saaraato.""  This means providing incomplete information about mandatory emergency equipment would be bad advice to tourists.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage *does* say a regular car can be used with extra caution, making this statement accurate, not bad advice.
*   **C:** The passage supports this, stating you can go to less-traveled places, so it's not bad advice.
*   **D:**  The passage says neighboring countries aren't always stable, but doesn't say they aren't worth visiting - just that safety is a concern.



"
Keeba kuwa soo socda aan lagu xusin tuduca in uu yahay khatar ka dhalan karta ama ka iman karta in la tago bacahaaga iyaga oo aan cidina ilaalinayn?,"The correct answer is **C: Waxay ku khaldami karaan qof kale**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Shandadaha aan lala joogin waxa soo beegsan kara tuugada iyo sidoo kale qolyaha maamulka ee ka warwarsan khatar miino."" This means authorities might mistakenly suspect you of something dangerous (like carrying a bomb) if your bag is unattended.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waa laga yaabaa in la xado:** The passage *does* mention theft as a risk, but the question asks what isn't mentioned as a direct risk.
* **B: Adigoon ogeyn waxaad noqon kartaa mid ka shaqeeya ilaalinta daroogada:** This is a central point of the passage – being used as a drug mule.
* **D: Maamuladu waxa ay u arki karaan bamba dhici rabto taas oo aad u khatar badan:** The passage says authorities might worry about a ""khatar miino"" (mine threat), which aligns with the idea of a bomb scare.



"
Waa maxay waxa tuduca aan lagu xusin ee ku saabsan qaadashada daroogada?,"The correct answer is **A: Wadamada qaarkood, dambiilayaasha markii ugu horeysay danbiga galay waxaa lagu xukumi karaa dil.**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Waddamada qaar ayaa leh xeer ciqaabeedyo aad u daran oo loogu talagalay xitaa dambiilayaasha markii ugu horeysay danbiga galay; kuwaas waxa ka mid noqon karaa...dil.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** While the passage emphasizes caution while traveling internationally, it doesn't highlight this as the unmentioned aspect of drug trafficking.
*   **C:** This is mentioned directly in the passage (""eeyaha wax shiiriya la isticmaali karo daqiiqad walba ayadoo leys ogeysiin"").
*   **D:** This is also stated in the passage (""Shandadaha aan lala joogin waxa soo beegsan kara...qolyaha maamulka ee ka warwarsan khatar miino."").



"
Cabbitaan noocee ah ayaan loo xusin inuu yahay shay laisku dayi karo in lagu sameeyo guriga inta lagu jiro fasaxa?,"The correct answer is **C: Khamriga (Wine)**.

Here's why:

The text says: ""Hadii aad inaad wax tijaabiso diyaar u tahay, cabbitaan fursad sii ama **isku qas burcad qudaareed**."" ""Burcad qudaareed"" is a poetic way to refer to wine (specifically, homemade or fermented wine). The text suggests experimenting with making this at home during your time off.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Casiirka (Juice)** - The text doesn't mention trying to make juice.
*   **B: Kafee (Coffee)** - The text states the house is *full* of coffee, implying it's readily available, not something to experiment with making.
*   **D: Shaaha (Tea)** - Similar to coffee, tea is described as being made, not experimented with.



"
Kuwan soo socda keebaa habboon inaad booqato inta lagu jiro fasaxa haddii magaaladaada ay caan ku tahay dhaqanka cabitaanka?,"The correct answer is **C: Makhaayadaha aanad sida caadiga ah aad ugu badnayn**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically suggests, ""Hadii aad ku nooshahay magaalo dhaqan cabitaan kala duwan, tag baararka ama pubs xaafadaha kale ee inta badan aadan tagin.""  This translates to, ""If you live in a city famous for its drinking culture, go to bars or pubs in other neighborhoods you don't often visit.""  Makhaayadaha (restaurants) that you don't usually go to fit this description – they offer a chance to explore the city’s diverse drinking scene.

Let's look at why the other options are less fitting:

*   **A: Dukaamada kafeega ee ku yaala diwada xaafadaada** (Coffee shops on your street) - While mentioned at the beginning, the passage focuses on *exploring* new options during vacation.
*   **B: Casiirka iyo dukaamada cabitaanka** (Juice and drink stores) - These are too general and don't focus on the cultural aspect of ""drinking"" the passage emphasizes.
*   **D: Makhaayadaha soo diyaariya shaaha chamomile-ka** (Restaurants that prepare chamomile tea) - This is too specific and doesn't align with the broader idea of exploring a city's drinking culture.



"
Halkee ayay farshaxannada ama sawirada qoolleyda aay ku yallaan?,"The correct answer is **B: Gudaha kaniisada** (Inside the church).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Barxadda kaniisadda, waxaa ku yaalo farshaxan qooley laga qoray dhagaxa dhalada u eg oo ku yaalo qabriyo korkooda.""  This translates to ""In the churchyard, there are relief carvings made of slate-like stone on top of the graves."" Therefore, the carvings are located within the church grounds, specifically on the graves.
"
Fiisaha noocee ah ayaa laga yaabaa inuu u baahdo qofka inuu bixiyo caddaynta taageero lacageed oo ku filan?,"The correct answer is **D: Fiiisaha ardayda**.

The passage specifically states: ""Waddamada intooda badan, waxaa laga rabaa inaad waraaq aqbalaad ka haysato machadka aad wax ka baran lahayd, iyo sidoo kale caddayn tusinaysa inaad haysato qarashkaad wax ku baran lahayd ugu yaraan sannadka ugu horeeya ee kooraskaaga."" This directly links the need for financial support evidence to student visas.



"
Yaa ay u badan tahay inuu u baahdo muda gororkisa fiisaha?,"The correct answer is **C: Arday caalami ah**.

The text explicitly states: ""u tagista arday caalami ah guud ahaan waxay u baahan tahay sii joogitaan ka dheer halka loo aado sida dalxiis Caadi ah"" and ""Fiisayaasha ardaydu guud ahaan waxay leeyihiin shuruudo iyo habraac ka duwan kuwa dalxiisa caadiga ah iyo kuwa ganacsiga."" This indicates students generally require more complex visas than tourists or business travelers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dalxiis joogto ah** - The text says short tourist visits *may not* need visas.
*   **B: Socdaal xiliyeedka** - This isn't directly mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Socdaal ganacsi** - The text distinguishes student visas from business visas, implying they are different but doesn't say business travelers *always* need more extensive visas."
Goorma ayay tahay inaad si gaar ah uga digtoonaato kaneecada?,"The correct answer is **C: Kaynta roobka**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that you need to be careful of ticks ""during the rainy season, especially if you want to grow keymaha roobleyda"" (keymaha roobleyda likely refers to plants that thrive in rainy conditions). It goes on to explain how easily ticks can get into a car even while *in* a rainy area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Inta lagu jiro bilaha xagaaga (During the summer months):** While ticks are active in summer, the passage focuses on the rainy season.
*   **B: Socodka masaafada dheer (Long distance travel):** The passage doesn't mention distance as a factor.
*   **D: Marka uu baabuurka kaxeeynaayo (When driving):** While the passage mentions getting ticks *in* a car, it's because of being in a tick-prone area (rainy season), not simply the act of driving.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaa la gudboon inaad iska ilaaliso inaad samayso si aad uga fogaato kaneecada marka aad dhex marayso kaynta roobka?","The correct answer is **A: Ka tagista albaabada baabuurka oo furan muddo aad u dheer**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that even briefly opening car doors while driving through rainy forests is enough for ticks to enter the vehicle. This directly relates to leaving car doors open, even for a short time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Wadista inta lagu jiro xiliga xagaaga:** The passage focuses on rainy seasons, not summer in general.
*   **C: Wadista iyada oo la marayo meelaha kulaala-hoosaadka ah:** While ticks are found in forests, the passage specifically highlights the risk when *driving through* them.
*   **D: Ka tagista baabuurka isaga oo aan cidna la joogin xiliga socodka masaafada dheer:** This isn't mentioned in the passage; the focus is on the act of entering/exiting the car during the drive.

Waa kuwee qayb ka mid ah kaynta oo ku taalla dhulka Hindiya?,"The correct answer is **A: Beerta Qaranka ee Sundarbans**.

The text states: ""Qaybta kaynta ee dhulka Hindiya ku taal waxa loogu yeedhaa Barxadda Qaran ee Duurka qurux badan."" This directly translates to ""The part of the mangrove forest located on Indian soil is called Sundarbans National Park."""
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Yaa ay u badan tahay in uu leeyahay ugu yaraan fahamka xaddidan ee luqadda Ingiriisiga?","The correct answer is **B: Dadka da'doodu aay yar tahay**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...intaas waxa dheer inaad aqoon gaaban filan karto - khaasatan dhalinyarada.""  This directly translates to ""...in addition to that, you can expect a reasonable understanding - especially young people."" This indicates that young people are more likely to have at least some understanding of English.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dadka ku hadla ugu yaraan laba luqadood oo kale:** The passage doesn't mention anything about people who speak multiple languages.
*   **C: Dadka u safraya Toronto:** Traveling to Toronto doesn't guarantee English understanding.
*   **D: Dadka da'doodu aay weyn tahay:** The text suggests the *opposite* - that younger people are more likely to have some English knowledge.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaa adkaani kara in lagu dhawaaqo?","The correct answer is **A: Erayada lahjada gaarka ah**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Tani waxay gaar u tahay xaqiiqda jeedina, taas oo ay adag tahay in lagu dhawaaqo si la fahmi karo.""  It then provides the example of people from different places (Mancunian, Bostonian, etc.) with their distinct accents and slang, implying that *those* specific pronunciations and words are difficult to understand.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Cinwaanada (Titles):** The text doesn't mention any difficulty with titles.
*   **C: Ereyada qoran (Written words):** The text states written words are *easier* to understand than spoken words.
*   **D: Halqabsiga deegaanka (Environmental concerns):** This isn't mentioned in the text at all.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Xaaladdee ayaa ku habboon qofka socotada ah ee qorsheynaya inuu baska ka raaco saldhigga degmooyinka dhexdooda?","The correct answer is **A: Socdaalku waxa uu ku sii jeedaa Jakar oo waxa hore u iibsaday tigidhka**.

Here's why:

* The text states that buses to Jakar/Bumthang *mainly* leave between 06:30 and 07:30, and that it's advisable to buy tickets days in advance because the buses are often crowded. Option A aligns with both these points.
* **B** is incorrect because the text doesn’t specify a 7 am departure requirement.
* **C** is incorrect because the text recommends taxis for shorter trips like Paro, and doesn’t mention a specific bus time.
* **D** is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention going ""bari"" (east) and the 6:20 arrival time isn’t relevant to bus planning.



"
Maxay noqon lahayd talo wanaagsan oo la siinaayo dalxiisaha doonaya inuu bari uga socdaalo saldhigga basaska ee degmooyinka dhexdooda?,"The correct answer is **B: Iibso tigidh hormaris ah**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""**Inta badan degmoyinka waxaa ka shaqeeya basaska koostarada Jabaaniska, kuwaaso ah kuwo raaxo wanaagsan.**"" and ""**Basaska isugu safra degmoyinka badana waa kuwa buuqa, waxaa lagula telinaya in aad iibsato tikidh ka hor maalmo.**"" This directly advises tourists to buy tickets in advance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Basasku waxay baxaan kaliya 8:30 ka dib** - The text says most to Jakar/Bumthang leave between 06:30 and 07:30, and buses run all day. This statement is incorrect.
*   **C: Basas badan ayaa baxa maalinta oo dhan** - While true, this doesn't give specific *advice*. The passage implies it’s busy and you should plan ahead.
*   **D: Tagaasida la wadaago ayaa laga yaabaa inay tahay habka ugu wanaagsan ee safarka** - Taxis are good for short distances (Paro, Punakha), but the question is about traveling *between* districts using the bus station.



"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan si sax ah aan u qeexaynin Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **C: Laguma isticmaali karo diyaarad**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Maanta, Timbuktu ayaa ah magaalo faqiir ah, inkastoo sumcadeeda ay ka dhigayso meel dadka dalxiiso soo jiidato, waxay na qabtaa garoon diyaarado."" (Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a place that attracts tourists, and it has an airport.)

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Waxay leedahay saamayn Carabi in ka badan marka loo eego dalka intiisa kale** - The passage states: ""Magaladu waxa ay leedahay ka duwaansho adag magaaloyinka dalka intiisa kale, sababtoo ah waxa ayleedahay qaab Carbeed inte Afrikaan ahaan laheyd."" (The city has a strong difference from the cities of the rest of the country, because it has an Arabic style rather than an African one).
*   **B: Waa meel saboolnimo aay ku habsatay** - The passage says: ""Maanta, Timbuktu ayaa ah magaalo faqiir ah..."" (Today, Timbuktu is a poor city...).
*   **D: Waxay wali tahay goob soo jiidato dalxiisayaal cajiib ah** -  The passage states: ""...inkastoo sumcadeeda ay ka dhigayso meel dadka dalxiiso soo jiidato..."" (...although its reputation makes it a place that attracts tourists...)

Midkee ka mid ah xaqiiqooyinka soo socda ee ku saabsan Timbuktu ayaa sax ah?,"The correct answer is **A: Magaalada waxaa lagu isticmaali karaa diyaarad**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""... waxay na qabtaa garoon diyaarado"" which translates to ""...and it has an airport.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage says it *is* a poor city, despite its reputation for attracting tourists - so it's not ""very remote compared to its poverty.""
* **C:** The passage states it has a *stronger* Arabic influence than other cities in Mali, meaning it's *less* African in character, not more.
* **D:** The passage explicitly says it *does* attract tourists: ""...inkastoo sumcadeeda ay ka dhigayso meel dadka dalxiiso soo jiidato..."" which translates to ""...although its reputation makes it a place that attracts tourists...""

Goorma ayaa markii hore la qorsheeyay ciyaaraha Olombikada xagaaga? ,"The correct answer is **D: Luulyo 2020**.

The text states: ""Hadii aad ballansatay duulimadyadaada iyo goobaha aad dagi lahayd 2020 kahor inta aan dib udhigida lagu dhawaaqin, ... marka loo qorsheeyay Olombikada."" This clearly indicates the games were originally scheduled for July 2020.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, goorma ayay mandiqadda noqotaa mid sida daweesha daluulyada oo kale?","The correct answer is **D: Ka dib markii aay taabtay dhulka**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states, ""Waxay ku bilaaben tuunbo lagagudbinayo daruuraha dabeesha waxayna noqotay “taluuliye” marka ay taabtan dhulka."" This directly translates to: ""They begin as a funnel descending from storm clouds and become a 'tornado' when they touch the ground.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Marka ay dabayshu gaadho 100 mayl saacaddiiba** - While high winds are a characteristic of tornadoes, the passage doesn't say this is when it *becomes* a tornado.
*   **B: Marka tiirarka hawadu ama taluulyada hawada aay bilaawdo inay wareegaan** - The passage mentions rotation, but doesn't state this is the defining moment of becoming a tornado.
*   **C: Iyadoo ay ka soo degayaan daruuraha duufaanka** - This is where it *starts* to form, not when it *becomes* a tornado.

*   **A:** In ay dabaylo 100-200 mayl saacaddiiba dhaliyaan waa qoraalka ku jira, laakiin maaha sifo gaar ah oo daweesha duumaha.
*   **C:** Qoraalku waxa ku sheegayaa in ay noqdaan “taluuliye” marka ay taabtaan dhulka, taa oo ka duwan sida mandaqada.
*   **D:** Qoraalku waxa ku sheegayaa in ay hawada ku nuugaan, taa oo ka duwan in ay hawada dibadda u riixaan."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Halkee ayuu qofka socotada ah ka heli karaa talo ku saabsan xaaladda siyaasadeed ee magaalada uu u socdo?","The correct answer is **B: Laga soo bilaabo aragtida lagu soo bandhigay la-talinta safarka**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Latalinta ayaaba iska ah xog dulmarid kooban ee jawiga siyaasada dalka."" (Translation: ""Travel advice is often just a brief overview of the country's political climate."")

This directly indicates that travel advice *includes* information about the political situation. While the passage also points out the limitations of this advice, it still identifies it as a source.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waxaa laga helaa dawladda dalka aay booqan doonaan** (You can get it from the government of the country you will visit) - The passage implies that advice might *differ* depending on your nationality, and doesn't specifically state you should rely on the destination country's government.
*   **C: Muwaadiniinta dalka ay booqan doonaan** (Citizens of the country you will visit) - The passage suggests that experiences differ *between* nationalities, so relying solely on citizens might not provide a complete picture.
*   **D: Wadankooda sax ah** (Their correct country) - This is too vague and doesn't pinpoint a specific source of information.



"
"Haddii ay dhacdo la-talin socdaal, waa maxay muwaadin ajnabi ah oo aan laga yaabo inuu la kulmo?","The correct answer is **B: Warbixin kooban oo aad u tafac tiran oo ku saabsan xaaladda siyaasadeed ee dalka**.

Here's why:

* The passage states ""Latalinta ayaaba iska ah xog dulmarid kooban ee jawiga siyaasada dalka."" This directly translates to ""Advice is often a brief overview of the country's political climate.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waxaa saameeyay ka noqoshada caymiska (Affected cancellation of insurance)** - While the passage mentions insurance being *affected*, it doesn't say the advice *is* about insurance cancellation.
* **C: Caymiska caafimaadka ayaa saameeyay (Health insurance was affected)** - Same issue as A - insurance is mentioned, but not as the content of the advice.
* **D: Warbixin faahfaahsan oo ku saabsan xaaladda siyaasadeed ee dalka (Detailed report on the country's political situation)** - The passage explicitly states the advice is a *brief* overview, not a detailed report.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Safar noocee ah ayaa ugu yar ee looga baahan yahay caawinaad ballan oo lala yeelanaayo wakiil socdaal?","The correct answer is **D: Safarka ugu horreeya ee musaafurka ah ee dibadda**.

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agents are *typically* useful for people traveling to places outside their ""familiar culture, customs, language, or lower-income countries."" A first-time international traveler would likely fall into this category, needing help with unfamiliar customs, potentially language barriers, and logistics.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A:** A work trip to a familiar city wouldn't require a travel agent's specialized assistance.
*   **B:** While a long trip on a budget *could* benefit from an agent, the passage highlights specialized agents for ""niche travel, economic bracket and destinations."" This doesn't necessarily mean *all* budget trips require an agent.
*   **C:** A language barrier *could* be a reason to use an agent, but the passage positions it as part of a broader need for assistance with unfamiliar places. The first-time international traveler encompasses this and more.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Xaaladee ayuu qofka socotada ahi ka faa'iidaysan karaa caawinta laga helo wakiilka socdaalka?","The correct answer is **D: Marka qofka socotada ah uu booqanayo meel ay ku kala duwan yihiin dhaqamada ay yaqaanaan**.

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agents are *especially* helpful for people traveling to places ""outside their usual habits, culture, language or lower-income countries."" This directly relates to visiting a place with different customs and cultures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't mention booking flights as the primary benefit.
*   **B:** While a travel agent *could* help with a specialized tour, the passage focuses on the general benefit of navigating unfamiliar places.
*   **C:** If someone already speaks the language, they wouldn't necessarily *need* a travel agent."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaa ka caawin kara qofka socotada ah si uu uga fogaado niyad jab marka uu booqanayo meelo cusub?","The correct answer is **A: Iyadoo la filayo heerar la mid ah halka ay ka yimaadeen**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Marka aad safreyso, waxat filata in aysan waxwalba ahaneyn sida ay ayaahin “marka guriga la joogo”... Kani waa wax aad mar kasta u baahan tahay inaad maskaxda ku hayso, si aad uga hortagto inaad ka caraysiiso ama niyad jabiso qaababka hawlaha deegaanka looga qabto.""

This means expecting differences – understanding things *won't* be the same as at home – is key to avoiding frustration and disappointment. This aligns with expecting different ""heerar"" (levels/standards).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Rabitaanka in la tijaabiyo cuntooyinka aan la aqoon:** While trying new foods is good, it doesn't directly address *avoiding* discouragement.
*   **C: U hoggaansanaanta sharciyada iskumidka ah halka ay ka yimaadeen:** This would actually *cause* problems, as the passage emphasizes that laws are different.
*   **D: Ka fogaanshaha cilmi-baaris hore oo ku saabsan hoyga:** Researching the destination would be helpful, not harmful.



"
"Iyadoo lagu salaynayo xogta tuducda, qof noocee ah ayaa laga yaabaa inuu la kulmo niyad jab markuu u safrayo meel shisheeye?","The correct answer is **C: Qofka aan bashaashka ahayn ee xidhxidhan** (A person who is not flexible and rigid).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that travelers need to be mindful that things won't be like ""home"" and that differences in laws, food, traffic, etc., are to be expected.  It emphasizes the importance of *avoiding frustration or disappointment* due to these differences.  Someone who is inflexible and rigid (xidhxidhan) would be the most likely to be upset by these changes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Qof jecel cuntooyinka qalaad** (A person who loves foreign foods) - This person would likely *enjoy* the difference in food, not be disappointed.
*   **B: Qof ku horumara isbeddelka** (A person who thrives on change) - This person would be adaptable and unlikely to be frustrated.
*   **D: Qof jecel waxbarashada** (A person who loves learning) - This person would likely see the differences as opportunities to learn and wouldn't be disappointed.

Kuwa soo socda keebaa aan ahayn tallada lagu taliyo socotada booqanaya waddan soo koraya markii ugu horeysay?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka fogow inaad cunooyin kala duwan aad cunto inta lagu jiro maalmahaaga ugu horreeya.**

Here's why:

The text *advises* travelers to be prepared for different food standards and qualities, but it doesn't suggest avoiding trying new foods altogether.  It focuses on managing expectations for comfort and hygiene.

Let's look at why the other options are *supported* by the text:

* **A: Baro xayawaanka deegaanka ka hor intaadan seexan dhulka** -  The text explicitly states ""Ha ku seexan furaash ama salli yaal dhulka meelaha aanad aqoon u lahayn xayawaanka deegaanka.""  and suggests bringing a mat or mosquito net.
* **C: Sariiraha yar yar ama sariirta marada ah ee kor u xidhka ayaa lagu taliyaa hadii aad dibada aad u bixi** - The text recommends a small mat or a mosquito net.
* **D: Maalgeli huteel tayo leh marka ugu horraysa ee aad timaado** - The text mentions being prepared for different hotel standards and that travelers often initially seek Western-style comfort.



"
Kuwan soo socda keebaa aan lagu xusin inay yihiin wax lacag baylah ah lagu bixiyo marka aad la qabsanayso wadan hadan so hormaraayo?,"The correct answer is **C: Joodari ama suuf loogu talagalay kaamamka inta lagu jiro**.

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions bringing your own sleeping pad or mosquito net to protect yourself. This implies these aren't readily available or guaranteed in developing countries and you may need to *provide them yourself* (i.e., they are an expense you need to plan for).

The other options are all mentioned as things you might *expect* to be different or lower quality (requiring adjustment in your expectations) rather than things you need to *pay for* to obtain:

*   **A: Cunto nooca reer galbeedka** - The text implies Western-style food might not be easily available.
*   **B: Addeegyada tayada leh** - The text suggests services might not be the same quality as you're used to.
*   **D: Hudheelo tayo leh** - The text points out hotel quality may differ.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Hadii aad la safrayso laabtoob ama taablit, nuqul ku xeree mimorigiisa ama cajalada (taasoo khad la’aan la heli karo)."" This means saving a copy to a laptop/tablet's memory is a recommended method when internet access might be unavailable.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: U dhiibitaanka koobiga qof saxibo yihin oo safar u baxaayo:** While sharing with a friend is mentioned for others *traveling with* or *staying behind*, it's not the best solution for the policy holder themselves when they may lack internet. It relies on someone else having the copy.
* **B: Imayl ahaan isugu soo diro nuqulka:** This requires internet access, which the question states might not be available.
* **D: ""Ku kaydinta nuqul gudaha """"Intarnetka gudihiisa”"":** This is a direct translation of ""cloud storage"" which *requires* internet access.

Here's why:

The text specifically asks for the email address for the *insurance* company and contact information related to *insurance* claims/approval. It doesn't mention needing the email address of a ""policymaker"" or anyone related to the policy itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nambarada telefoonada caalamiga ah ee sheegashooyinka** - The text explicitly states a need for international numbers for claims.
* **B: Ciwaanka iimaylka ee caymis bixiyaha** - The text explicitly states a need for the insurance provider's email address.
* **C: Nambarada telefoonka caalamiga ah ee ogolaanshaha** - The text explicitly states a need for international numbers for approval.

Qaababka filimada soo socda keebaa bixiya qaabnaqshadayn qurxoon oo la mid ah DSLR?,"The correct answer is **A: 35 mm film**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Filimka caadiga ah ee 35 mm ayaana ah ka ugu caansan...waxaanay leedahay tayo sawireed u dhiganta DSLR-ta hadda."" This directly links 35mm film to image quality comparable to DSLRs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Filim qaab dhexdhexaad ah:** The passage mentions medium format film (6x6 and 5x6 cm) has *more* detail than 35mm, not equal quality to a DSLR.
*   **C: 56 x 56 mm filim:** This is a specific type of medium format film, and as explained above, it provides more detail than 35mm, but is not stated as being equal to DSLR quality.
*   **D: 6 x 6 cm filim:** This is also a type of medium format film with higher detail than 35mm, but not equal to DSLR quality according to the text."

The passage states: ""Marka aad noqoto mid xasiloon adigoo ku saleynayo akhidada sidoo kale diyaarinayo websaydh k, hodhow, waxaad sameyn kartaa websaydh aad adigu leedahay."" This translates to ""Once you are stable by building skills and also preparing a website, then you can create a website you own.""  This clearly indicates that creating your own website is the *final* step after skill development and initial website preparation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Barashada qaabka waxa loogu qoro shabakada** (Learning how to write for the web) - This is part of skill development, an earlier step.
*   **B: Qor maqaallo dhowr ah oo loogu talagalay warbixinta safar oo sumcad leh** (Write a few articles for a reputable travel report) - This is also part of building your portfolio and skills, a step *before* having your own website.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the easiest way to start a travel writing business is to **develop your skills and create a travel blog**. This means strong writing skills and the ability to create engaging blog content are foundational.

Let's look at why the other options are less crucial *initially*:

* **B: Wax ku daabacaada shabakada (Web Publishing)** - This is a result of having content *to* publish.  You need the writing first.
* **C: Naqshadaynta (Design)** - While helpful, design can be outsourced or done with templates. It's not the core skill to *start*.
* **D: Samaynta mareegaha ama wabseetyada (Website Creation)** -  The passage mentions building a website *after* becoming established, meaning it's a later step.  You can start with a free blogging platform before investing in your own website.

This translates to: ""Also, in hot climates, bacteria grow quickly and can survive outside the body for a long time. This results in punishments like Delhi Belly, Pharaoh's Curse, Montezuma's Revenge, and their many companions.""

Therefore, hot climates are the ones most often associated with digestive issues."

Kuwan soo socdaa keebaa faa'iido u leh safarka gudaha aagga Schengen?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka fogaanshiyaha isbaarooyinka badan ee kantaroolka baasaboorka**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Intaad ku jirto aaggan, waxaad guud ahaan ka gudbi kartaa xuduudaha adoon sii marin qaybta baasboorada mar kale."" This directly translates to avoiding many passport control checks.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ka fogaanshada codsashada fiisaha badan:** While the Schengen visa simplifies things, it doesn't necessarily eliminate the *need* for a visa altogether. You still need a Schengen visa, but not individual visas for each country.
*   **B: Keydinta lacagta:** The text mentions saving time and ""office work"" but doesn't explicitly state saving money.  The cost savings are implied, but not a direct benefit mentioned.
*   **D: Looma baahna baasaboor:** This is incorrect. The text says you need a passport to *enter* the Schengen area initially.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Taajiriinta ugu sareysa xabaalaha ma sii jiri doonaaan in badan, lakin waa laga saaray Madxafka Masar ee Qahiro."" This means the valuable contents (the treasure) of the tomb are no longer inside.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waxyaabaha la qurxiyay qaar kamid ah** - The text mentions the decorations *are* present, just limited.
*   **B: Maskarihii madax gashiga ahaa ee maamada** - The text doesn't specifically mention the mask being removed.
*   **C: Garab gashiyaashii mamada** - The text talks about the remains of Tutankhamun himself, not other statues.

Here's why:

The text states Bowen Island is accessible by a ferry from Granville Island and describes it as a day trip or getaway with various activities. It doesn't mention Bowen Island being expensive.

In contrast, the text explicitly states that Whistler is a ""qaaliya"" (expensive) town. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jasiirada Granville:** This is just the starting point to get to Bowen Island, not a destination where you'd spend money.
*   **B: Waddada Badda ilaa Cirka:** The text mentions the Sea to Sky Highway *to get to Whistler*, which is expensive.
*   **D: Firimbi yeeriyaha:** This option is not mentioned in the text."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Meeshee ku taal Vancouver waxay u badan tahay inay siiso socotada khibrad dhab ah?","The correct answer is **A: Jasiirada Bowen**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Bowen Island ""offers a day trip or vacation filled with hiking, mountain biking, shops, restaurants and more"" and that the community is located near Vancouver. It’s presented as a place where tourists can experience a lot. The other options are not highlighted as offering that kind of experience. 

* **Granville Island** is mentioned only as the departure point for the ferry *to* Bowen Island.
* **Vancouver Downtown** is simply the general location.
* **Whistler** is a separate destination, a 1.5-hour drive from Vancouver."

Here's why:

The text states that during the rainy season (November to March) the water volume is so high it *obscures* the view of the falls - ""xad muuqaalka Biya Dhaca dhabta ah ay qariyaan - biyahaas oo dhami!"". It also says it's the best time for seeing the falls when the volume is high enough to *hide* the falls themselves, but that's not what the question is asking.

The question asks when you can see the falls *without* anything blocking the view. This would be *after* the rainy season when the water level has gone down.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nofeembar ilaa Maarso** - This is the rainy season, when the view is obscured.
*   **B: Xiliga dalxiiska** - The text mentions it's a popular tourist spot, but doesn't specify *when* peak tourist season is.
*   **C: Marka mugga biyuhu uu sarreeyo** - This is when the view is *most* obscured."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Waa maxay kor u kaca booqashada dagaandaga biyaha ee Victoria inta u dhaxaysa Noofembar iyo Maarso?","The correct answer is **A: Muuqa tooska ah ee aan waxa qarinaaya jirin ee dagaandaga biyaha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...mugga biyaha ayaa aad u sareeya illaa xad muuqaalka Biya Dhaca dhabta ah ay qariyaan - biyahaas oo dhami!"". This means during November to March, the high volume of water *obscures* the view of the falls themselves. Therefore, the increase in the visit is due to the view of the falls being completely covered by water.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dalxiisayaal yar:** The passage doesn't suggest fewer tourists; it highlights the attraction despite the conditions.
*   **C: Muuqaalo cajiib ah oo ku saabsan dagaandaga biyaha oo aad u qurxooon:** While the falls are beautiful, the passage emphasizes that the view is *blocked* by the water, not enhanced.
*   **D: Ka fogaanshaha xilli roobaadka:** The passage clearly states this *is* the rainy season (November to March)."

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Inaad kamarada duusha dul mariso madaar ama lagu buuqsan yahay waa fikrad aan fiicnayn, xitaa hadii ay sharci ka tahay halkaad joogto.""  This means busy areas are *not* good places to film with a drone. It also implies avoiding places where the drone will be noticeable or disruptive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't suggest filming where people don't mind a drone. It emphasizes avoiding problematic areas.
*   **B:** While avoiding places where regular photography is prohibited is good advice generally, the passage specifically focuses on drone use.
*   **D:** Having permits is important, but the passage isn't *about* finding places where permits are already obtained; it's about selecting suitable locations in the first place.

"Si ku salaysan tuduca, bayaankee ku saabsan shuruudaha diiwaangelinta ee habka fiisaha aan run ahayn?","The correct answer is **B: Wadamada oo dhami waxay u baahan yihiin in laga diiwaan geliyo maamulka deegaanka.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that *some* countries require registration, not all. It also mentions that in *some* places, only those staying outside tourist accommodations need to register. This directly contradicts the statement that all countries require registration with local authorities.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

* **A: Haddii aad degan tahay hoyga dalxiiska, waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan u baahnayn inaad isdiiwaangeliso** - The text supports this, saying registration may only be required for those *not* staying in tourist accommodations.
* **C: Booqashada xafiisyada socdaalka ayaa laga yaabaa in loo baahdo** - The passage explicitly states that registration might involve visiting immigration offices.
* **D: Meelaha qaarkood, huteelada maxalliga ah ayaa samayni karaan diiwaangelinta** -  The passage confirms this: ""hotelada deegaaneed ayaa sameeyo diiwan gelinta (hubso inaad weydiiso).""



"
Kuwan soo socda kee baan ahayn meel uu dalxiisuhu tegi karo si uu samaystaan diiwaangelintooda?,"The correct answer is **C: Xafiiska boostada deegaanka (The local post office)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that registration can be done at:

*   Local police stations
*   Local hotels (sometimes)
*   Immigration offices

It does *not* mention post offices as a place to register. Therefore, a post office is the option that is not a place a tourist would go to for registration."
Yaa aan ka faa'iidaysan doonin mutadawacnimada marka ay safrayaan?,"The correct answer is **B: Qof raadinaya mushahar la taaban karo oo sareeyo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""shaqooyin badan oo mutadawacnimo ahi qollaal iyo mushahar yar bixiyaan"" (many volunteer jobs offer little or low pay).  Therefore, someone seeking a substantial salary would *not* benefit from volunteering while traveling.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Qof rajaynaya inuu saaxiibo cusub ku yeesho dibadda** - The passage says volunteering allows you to ""kula kulmayso dad cusub"" (meet new people).
*   **C: Qof rajeynaya inuu barto xirfad cusub** - The passage states you can ""ku baran karto xirfad cusub"" (learn a new skill).
*   **D: Qof laga yaabo inuu xiiseynayo inuu qof martigaliyo haween** - The passage doesn't mention anything about this, so we can't determine if it would be a benefit or detriment.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Sidee tabarucnimada markaad dibadda joogto faa'iido u leedahay socotada ku jirta miisaaniyada ama aadka u xisaabtamo?","Jawaabta saxda ah waa **D: Waxay kaa caawin kartaa inaad hesho dareen aragtiyeed**.

Halkan sababta:

Tuduca wuxuu sheegayaa in tabarucu kugu caawinayo inaad naftaada ku barato, dad cusub kula kulanto, oo aad ku hesho ""dhinac kale oo wax laga arko"".  Taas oo macnaheedu yahay inuu faa'iido u leeyahay socotada waxbarasho ahaan iyo dareenka aragtiyadeed ahaan.

Halkan sababta jawaabaha kale aysan saxayn:

*   **A: Mushahar ayaa had iyo jeer la bixiyaa:** Tuduca wuxuu sheegayaa in shaqooyinka mutadawacnimo badankoodu qollaal iyo mushahar yar bixiyaan.
*   **B: Caadiyan waxay keentaa fursado shaqo:** Tuduca ma sheegin in tabarucu fursado shaqo keeno.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Maxaa loo tixgalin karaa in ay caadi tahay safarka celceliska ah ee lagu tagaayo Walt Disney World?","The correct answer is **C: Ku qaadashada safarka oo dhan Disney property**.

Here's why:

The passage states a typical visit involves ""flying into Orlando International Airport, being picked up by a bus to your Disney area hotel, spending a week within Disney property, and then returning home."" This directly describes a trip focused entirely on the Disney experience and staying within the Disney area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku qaadashada toddobaadka sahaminta beeraha qaranka ee duurjoogta laga helo** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: Joogitaanka huteel ka baxsan goobta** - The passage specifically mentions staying at a ""Disney area hotel"" - within the property.
*   **D: Ka raacitaanka baska garoonka diyaaradaha oo lagu tagaayo huteelka** - While mentioned, this is *part* of the typical trip, but doesn't encompass the whole experience like option C does. It's a detail *within* the typical trip.



"
Keebaa weedhaha soo socda ee ku saabsan Walt Disney World aan run ahayn?,"The correct answer is **A: Tigidhada Park-hopper waxaa lagu wareejin karaa socotada kale**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Tikidhadu waa qaar aan la beddeli karin"" (Tickets are non-transferable). This directly contradicts option A, which says Park-hopper tickets *can* be transferred to other travelers.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

*   **B: Waxaa jira hoy oo laga heli karo goobta** - The passage mentions staying at a Disney hotel (""ayadoo bas kuu qaado hudheelka Disney meesha ku yaal"").
*   **C: Waxaa jira basas diyaar u ah inay dadka safarka ah ka soo qaadaan gegida dayuuradaha oo ay geeyaan ila dhismaha** - The passage states a bus will pick you up from Orlando International Airport and take you to the Disney resort.
*   **D: Tigidhada Multi-day ayaa inta badan laga heli karaa mareegaha xaraashka** - The passage mentions tickets being sold on websites like eBay and Craigslist.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Keeba arrimaha soo socda ayey u badan tahay in aan lagu baran fasal tababar xirfadeed ama daabacaado?","The correct answer is **C: Diyaar garowga dagaal**.

Here's why:

The passage states the training course is linked to ""role play, first aid, and *sometimes weapons training*."" It specifically mentions the context is for people visiting countries considered war zones. This strongly suggests the training focuses on preparing for dangerous, war-related scenarios.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Badbaadada cidlada (Wilderness safety)**: The passage mentions ""wild terrain survival"" books but clarifies publications related to war zones are *scarce*.
*   **B: U diyaargarowga gargaarka degdegga ah (First aid preparation)**: While first aid *is* included in the course, it's listed alongside other components like role play and weapons training, not as the primary focus.
*   **D: Door ka ciyaaritaanka (Role-playing)**: Role-playing is a *method* used in the training, not the subject of the training itself.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Teeba maadooyinka soo socda ayey u badantahay in lagu barto fasalka tababarka xirfadda?","The correct answer is **A: Gargaarka degdega ah (First Aid)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...koorasku caadiyan wuxuu noqondoonaa laga bilaabo 2-5 maalmood wuxuna la xidhiidhi doonaa doorka ciyaarta, **gargaaro kowaad badan** iyo marmarka qaar tababar hubab.""  This clearly indicates first aid is a component of the professional training.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Goobaha dagaalka (Battlefields):** While the training is *for* people visiting conflict zones, the text doesn't say battlefield tactics are *taught* in the course.
* **C: Badbaadada cidlada (Wilderness survival):**  The text mentions resources relating to wilderness safety are common, but the training itself is focused on conflict zones.
* **D: Deegaanka jawigiisu adagyahay (Harsh environmental conditions):** The text does allude to challenging environments, but doesn't specifically say this is a core skill taught in the course."

Sababta:

*   Tuduca waxa uu sheegayaa in karkaarinta biyaha ay tahay hab nadiifinta ah, laakiin inta lagu karkaarayo ay ku xirantahay meesha iyo tayada biyaha. Waxa uu soo jeedinayaa in daqiiqad kaliya ay ku filan tahay meelaha qaarkood, laakiin meelaha kale waxaa loo baahan yahay in wax ka badan.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Maxaasan suurtagal u noqoni karin xitaa dabal yaqaanada, kuwaas oo leh xirfada dabaasha ee loo baahan yahay?","The correct answer is **C: Ku dabaalashada biyaaha qul qulaayo adiga oo ka hor imaanaya**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dhimashooyinka badankoodu waxay ka dhasheen iyadoo qofku isku dayayo inuu maayadda ka hortago, taasoo aan suuro gal ahayn.""  This directly means trying to swim *against* the rip current (qulqulka soo noqnoqdaa) is impossible, even for skilled swimmers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ku dabaalashada meelaha dagxaanta aadka ah leh:** The passage doesn't mention difficulty with depth in general, only potential power at deeper levels *contributing* to the rip current.
*   **B: Ku dabaalashada biyaha qotada dheer:** Similar to A, it doesn't say deep water is impossible to swim in, just that it can contribute to the rip.
*   **D: Ku dabaalashada hareeraha mawjadaha ama hirarka:** While potentially dangerous, the passage focuses specifically on the danger of fighting the *rip current* itself, not just waves.



"
Maxaad samayn lahayd haddii aay biyaha socdaan aay ku qaadaan?,"The correct answer is **C: U dabaalo jiho lid ku ah jihada aay biyaha ku socdaano**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that trying to fight the current (""maayadda"") is futile and often leads to drowning.** Options B and D both involve directly confronting the current.
* **The passage suggests trying to escape the current's pull by swimming *parallel* to the shore.** Option C, swimming in a direction opposite to the current, aligns with this strategy – essentially swimming *out* of the rip current's influence before attempting to return to shore.
* **Option A is good advice *after* you've escaped the rip current,** but it doesn't address the immediate danger of being caught in it.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Goobtee ayaa laga yaabaa in booqashada qalcadda ay tahay dalxiis fasax qiimo leh?","The correct answer is **C: Dooxada Rhine**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""visiting the royal residences of the Loire valleys, the Rhine valleys..."" as an example of a beautiful and relaxing vacation spot. This directly links the Rhine valleys (dooxada Rhine) to valuable tourism involving castles (royal residences).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Magaalo ku teedsan Danube:** While the Danube is mentioned as a place for interesting walks, the passage doesn't specifically mention castle visits there.
*   **B: Goobta ku xigta kannaalka Erie:** The Erie Canal is mentioned for boat trips, not castle visits.
*   **D: U dhow marin-biyood kasta oo gudaha ah:** This is too broad. The passage gives specific examples, not a general statement about all inland waterways.

Here's why:

The text *specifically advises* women to *claim* they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.  This is the opposite of avoiding talking about marital status.

Let's look at why the other options *are* advice given in the text:

*   **B: La soco in kala duwanaanshaha dhaqanku uu keeni karo fal dhaqan ka fal-celin ah oo ka yimaada dadka deegaanka** - The text directly warns about different cultural norms and what might be considered offensive.
*   **C: Iska ilaali xidhashada dahabka ifaya** - The text advises wearing a ring (but not necessarily an expensive one), implying caution about displaying wealth.
*   **D: Isku day inaad isticmaasho is adkeys marka loo baahdo** - The text stresses the importance of firmly refusing unwanted advances.



"
"Iyada oo ku saleysan aagga lagu sharraxay tuducdu, maxay noqon doonaa tilmaan waxtar u leh oo loogu talagalay haweenka socotada ah?","The correct answer is **D: Kiisaska tijaabooyinka aan loo baahnayn, ku adkayso diidmada ragga.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ku adkoow diidista ragga, hana ka biqin inaad ku dhegenaato go’aankaaga.""  This directly supports the idea of firmly refusing unwanted advances. The phrase ""tijaabooyinka aan loo baahnayn"" (unnecessary trials/tests) hints at unwanted attention.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aqoonso inay tahay wax aan caadi ahayn in la raaco** - While understanding cultural differences is important, the passage doesn't focus on *being accompanied* but on navigating interactions with men.
* **B: Xiro faraanti weyn si aad u muujiso xaaladda guurka** - The passage says to wear a ring, but *not necessarily an expensive one* and primarily as a way to *imply* marital status for safety, not to make a statement.
* **C: Faham in kala duwanaanta dhaqameedku ay kuu soo jeedinayaan inaad diiddo inaad beddesho ra'yigaaga** - The passage focuses on being firm in your *refusals* specifically, not on a general refusal to change your mind on all things. It's about boundary setting.

"Iyada oo ku saleysan tuduca, xaaladdee ayaa u baahan karta sawir qaade duurjoogta ah inuu isticmaalo bikaac khaas ah?","The correct answer is **A: Haddii ay sawirayaan gaar ahaan makhluuqyada yaryar**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sawirada xayawaanada ka badana waxay u bahan yahiin kamarad afkeedu dheer yahay, inkasto shimbiraha duula iyo noolaha kale ee yaryari ay u bahan yahiin qaar kale."" This directly indicates that different creatures (specifically small ones) require *different* types of lenses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** While the text mentions rules in gardens regarding commercial use, it doesn't say this necessitates a specific lens.
*   **C:** The text mentions animals that are shy or aggressive, but doesn't link this to a need for a special lens.
*   **D:** The text mentions rules in gardens, but again, doesn't say this dictates a specific lens.

Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa in qalab gaar ah loo baahan yahay (kamarad afkeedu dheer) noocyada kala duwan ee xayawaanada, laakiin ma sheegin in helitaanka qalabkan ay tahay caqabad.

Halkan fiiri sababta jawaabaha kale ay yihiin kuwo khaldan:

*   **A: Helitaanka xayawaanada aan aadka u badnayn ama kuwa yar sida masaska** - Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa in xayawaannada adag in la helo ay jiraan.
*   **B: Sidii aay oola dhaqmi lahaayeen xayawaanada aan lala dhaqmi karin ee dhibka badan** - Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa in duurjoogtu dadka ka carari karaan ama weerari karaan.
*   **D: ka shaqaynta deeganka laga yaaba in dhibaatooyinka kaso gaaraan** - Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa in bay'adda noqon karto mid qow, kulul ama adag."

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Waddooyinka barafka leh, islisku waa hooseeyaa gaarigana uguma wadi kartid sida laami bannaan."" This means reduced traction (the ""dhulka oo xooga wadista dhib ku noqdo"") is a direct and major challenge when driving in mountainous or high-altitude areas with potential for ice or snow.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to be the *most* problematic:

* **A: Ciriiri aad u badan oo zaxmad ah:** While annoying, heavy snowfall itself isn't as immediately dangerous as the *ice* that can form from it, or the reduced traction it causes.
* **C: Uumi hoorow oo aad u badan:** Fog reduces visibility, but the passage mentions visibility is impacted by snow/ice *on* the windshield. Reduced traction is a more fundamental problem.
* **D: Araga oo yaraada:** Again, reduced visibility is mentioned, but the core issue highlighted in the passage is the difficulty in controlling the vehicle due to slippery conditions.



"
Maxay u badan tahay inay sii ahaato mid joogto ah oo ku saabsan cashuurta dakhliga ee waddamo kala duwan?,"The correct answer is **A: Heerarka (Rates)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""heerka canshuurtuna waa uu kala duwan yahay wadan walba"" (tax rates vary from country to country).  This directly addresses what is likely to continue to be different regarding income tax in different countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Qab-dhismaha (Structure)** - While tax structures can differ, the passage focuses on the *rates* differing.
*   **C: Halka aad ka fayl garaaysato (Where you file)** - Filing location is a consequence of tax laws, not a core difference *between* countries' tax systems.
*   **D: Garbaha (Sleeves)** - This is irrelevant to the context of tax.

Here's why:

The text states that when working abroad, you are generally required to pay taxes in the country you reside in. It also specifically mentions that in federal countries like the US and Canada, taxes are paid at both federal and local levels.  Therefore, you would file taxes in *every place where you have a tax residency* (meaning where your base is).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dalka Maraykanka:** The text uses the US as an example of a federal system, but doesn't say you *only* file there.
* **C: Dalka aad hadda ka shaqaynayso:** You *might* file in the country you're working in, but that's not the only place. The text focuses on where you are *resident*.
* **D: Meel kasta oo khidmadaha ay yihiin kuwa ugu hooseeya:** This option is irrelevant to the text's discussion of tax filing.

Keebaa weedhahan soo socda aan si sax ah u qeexin Bandhigga Adduunka?,"The correct answer is **D: Waddamada loogama baahna inay ka qaybqaataan.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states the *wadamada ka qayb galaya* (countries participating) are present at the World Expo. This implies participation is not mandatory.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bandhigyadu waxay muujin karaan taariikhda ama dhaqanka waddanka** - The text explicitly says pavilions showcase a country's culture and history.
*   **B: Bandhigyada sayniska dhirta waxaa lagu soo bandhigay bandhig faneed iyo waxbarasho** - The text describes World Expo as both scientific and artistic and also mentions horticultural exhibitions.
*   **C: Dhacdooyinka waxay socon karaan ilaa lix bilood** - The passage states events last ""inta udhaxeysa saddex ilaa lix bilood"" (between three to six months).



"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda ee qaanuunka Bandhigga Adduunka ama Bandhiga Caalamiga ah?,"The correct answer is **A: Bandhigyadu waa inay soo bandhigaan taariikhda waddanka iyo arrimaha adduunka labadaba**.

Here's why:

* The text states that pavilions at the World Expo showcase ""xaaladaha aduunka ama dhaqanka iyo raariikhda wadankooda"" - which translates to the world's conditions or the culture and history of their country. This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Isla waddanku ma martigelin karo dhacdooyinka sannadlaha ah:** The text says the Expo *can* appear yearly in different countries, implying a country *can* host, but it's not an annual fixed event.
* **C: Dhacdooyinka waa inay socdaan ilaa lix bilood:** The text says events last *between* three to six months.  It's not a requirement they last the full six.
* **D: Si Bandhiga loo qabto, waa in dalalka oo dhan ay ka qayb qaataan:** The text only states that countries *participate* in the Expo; it doesn't say all countries *must* participate for it to happen.

Qoraalka ayaa si cad u sheegay in aad u jirsato ugu yaraan 100 mitir oorsada iyo yeyda iyo 25 mitir dhammaan xayawaanada kale ee duurjoogta ah. Ka fogaanshaha yeeyda 25 yaardi (qiyaas ahaan 25 mitir) waxay ula mid tahay raacista tilmaamaha Jardiinka, taas oo hoos u dhigaysa suurtagalnimada weerar.

Halkan waxaa ah sababta jawaabaha kale aan saxeyn:

*   **A: Qaadashada geedo caraf udgoon** - Qoraalka wax faahfaahin ah kama bixin geedaha caraf udgoon ama sida ay u saameyn karaan weerarrada xayawaanka.
*   **B: Ka saarida qashinka goobta qashin qubka ah** - Ka saarida qashinka waa wanaag, laakiin qoraalku wuxuu si gaar ah ugu diirada saaraa masaafada xayawaanka.
*   **D: Ka hor istaaga xayawaanaha hanbada ama haraaga cuntada** - Qoraalku wuxuu sheegay in aad ka fogowdo cunto karsan, laakiin wax wuxuu ka qabanayo xayawaanka hanbada ama haraaga cuntada."

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions these as reasons for potential attacks:

* **B: Ku guuldareysiga ilaalinta fogaanta ama masaafada:** The text states you must stay 100 meters from bears and bison, and 25 meters from other animals. It also mentions injuries occur due to not keeping enough distance.
* **C: Quudinta duurjoogta:** The text advises against bringing cooked food, implicitly discouraging feeding the animals.
* **D: Xayawaanada aan aqoonta u lahayn aadanaha:** The text highlights that even seemingly docile animals like bison and elk can be dangerous.

However, the passage **does not** mention strong scents or odors as a reason animals might attack. Therefore, A is the answer."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwaan soo socda kee baa loo arkaa xal mustaqbalka fog ah oo lagu xalin karo arimaha deegaanka?","The correct answer is **C: Aqoonsiga sababta mashaakilka** (Identifying the cause of the problems).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that if we want a solution that isn't temporary (""xal ku meelgaara""), we need to ""raadinaa asalka mushkiladda markaas, waana inaynu halkaas ka soo joojino"" (find the root of the problem and stop it there).  This is about addressing the fundamental reasons for environmental issues, not just treating the symptoms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Qaadicida doorashada hab nololeedka qaaliga ah** (Reducing the choice of expensive lifestyles): The text implies that *consumption patterns* are a problem (""qaab nololeedka tagrifalka ah""), but doesn't suggest limiting choices as the core solution.
*   **B: Dhaqdhaqaaqa** (Activism):  The text mentions joining environmental movements, but frames it as a symptom-treatment approach (""daawayn astaamo leh"").
*   **D: Noqoshada xulufada dhaqdhaqaaqa deegaanka** (Becoming allies of the environmental movement): Similar to B, this is seen as an action that addresses the effects, not the root cause.

The passage states: ""The War of the Spanish Succession became the first war where the main issue was a balance of powers."" This directly answers the question. 

While the war *involved* many European nations, it originated from disputes over the Spanish throne and the potential for one power (France, in this case) becoming too dominant. This shift from religious conflicts to power balance conflicts is the key point."
Dagaalkee ayaa mararka qaar lagu tilmaamaa inuu ahaa ‘dagaal diimeedkii’ ugu dambeeyay?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagaalkii sodonka sano** (The Thirty Years' War).

The passage explicitly states: ""Sidaa daraadeed, Dagaalkii Soddonka Sanno ayaa noqday dagaalkii ugu dambeeyay dagaal diimeed lagu magacaabo."" (Therefore, the Thirty Years' War became the last war to be called a religious war.)

Midkee kamida dhinacyada soo socda ee kaniisada katooliga ee aan la baarin?,"The correct answer is **C: Diirad saarista awood qaybsiga kaniisada dhexdeeda**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage focuses on the centralization of power and wealth within the Catholic Church, specifically in Rome.** It highlights how this concentration of power led to questioning of the Church's principles. The text doesn't delve into *how* power was distributed within the Church, just that it was heavily centralized.
*   **A: Hadii qoondaynta hantida kaniisada dhexdeeda ay ahayd mid haboon** – The passage directly addresses concerns about how the Church's wealth was used (or not used to alleviate poverty).
*   **B: Haddii mabaadi,da ugu waawayn ee diinta wax laga badellay** – The passage mentions a key principle (using wealth to reduce poverty) that was being questioned, implying a potential shift from original principles.
*   **D: Haddii mabaadi'da ugu muhiimsan ee Kaniisadda la kulmiyay** – The passage explicitly states that the Church's principles were being challenged.

Therefore, option C is the aspect of the Catholic Church that the passage *does not* explore or question."

Sababta:

* Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa in dadkii cadhaysnaa ay Boqorka iyo Boqorada ku qasbeen inay daaqadohooda furaan.
* Saddexda kale (B, C, iyo D) waxay dhamaantood ka tirsan yihiin waxyaabaha qasabka ah ee ay dadku sameeyeen. Waxayna ahaayeen:

Weedhee ayaan si sax ah u qeexayn go'doominta badda ee Britain ee ka dhanka ah Jarmalka?,"The correct answer is **A: Waxay ka hor timid sharciga caalamiga ah**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the British naval blockade ""burisay sharci caalami oo la wada ogolahay...lagu ansixiyay heshiisyo caalami"". This directly means the blockade was against international law.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Waxay keentay dagaalkii gujisyada ee Jarmalka:** While the blockade *led* to Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare, it wasn't the *definition* of the blockade itself.
*   **C: Waxay joojisay qulqulkii sahaydii Jarmalka:** The passage says it aimed to block aid, but doesn't state it *completely* stopped all supplies. It focuses on the legality of the act, not the degree of success.
*   **D: Waxay hubisay in maraakiibta dhexdhexaadka ah aan la halis gelin doonin:**  The passage explicitly states the blockade *endangered* even neutral ships (""khatar ku keentay xitaa maraakiibta dhexdhexaadka ah"").

"Iyada oo ku saleysan qoraalka, yaa u badan in laga helo Cudurka Dareemyaasha (Sclerosis Multiple)?","The correct answer is **A: 32 sano jir dhedig ah**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Cilmi badhistu waxay ogaatay in dumarku ay laba jeer ay u badan tahay iney heelan xanuunka MS marka loo eego ragga."" (Research has found that women are twice as likely to develop MS compared to men.)
* **The text also indicates:** MS affects young adults and children.

Therefore, a 32-year-old woman has the highest probability of developing MS based on the information provided. The other options are less likely because they are either male (B & C) or too young (D - while MS *can* occur in children, it's more common in young adults).

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxay ka qaybgalayaasha dhaqdhaqaaqyada joogtada ah waxay ugu baahdaan taageero dheeraad ah?","The correct answer is **A: Aragtida xun ee xanuunka**.

Here's why:

The text states that participants in regular exercise ""needed assistance with overcoming false beliefs about pain-related fear and the sensation of harm from normal movement."" This directly translates to needing help with a negative perception of pain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dhabarka hoose (Lower back):** While the study is *about* lower back pain, the question asks what kind of *support* the participants need, not the location of the pain.
*   **C: Walbahaar (Sadness):** While sadness is mentioned in the text, it's not identified as something participants needed specific help overcoming during exercise.
*   **D: Cabsi (Fear):** Fear is mentioned, but it's paired *with* ""false beliefs about pain,"" making the mistaken belief about pain the primary issue needing addressing.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, sidee loo ciyaaraa dayrka?","The correct answer is **D: Qaab kala reeb ah**.

The text states the game was first played with ""two methods, one of which was horse running and adding another"". This describes a phased or tiered approach, meaning it was played in levels - essentially a 'kala reeb ah' (tiered/phased) way.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Qaab casri ah (Modern style)** - The text doesn't focus on the *style* of play, but *how* it was initiated.
* **B: Heer jaamacadeed (University level)** - While universities are mentioned as a level of play, it doesn’t describe *how* the game was initially played.
* **C: Heerka Olombikada (Olympic level)** - Similar to B, this is a level of play, not the initial method.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwan soo socda keebaa noqon lahaa tilmaame kan ugu xoogan ee sumowga gudaha?","The correct answer is **A: Lalabbo iyo qandho**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Calaamadaha, sida mataga ayaa kuwo guuda mana ahan mid markiiba baaritaan dag daga lagu sameyn karo."" This means vomiting isn't immediately diagnostic. While the text mentions vomiting, it also strongly points to looking for the source in open containers of medication or chemicals within the home.  Lalabbo (vomit) and qandho (stomach contents) being present *in conjunction with* finding a potential source is a strong indicator of internal poisoning.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to be the strongest immediate indicator:

*   **B: Matag iyo dhidid** - Vomiting alone, as the text states, isn’t a clear sign. Sweating can have many causes.
*   **C: casiraad daran iyo calool xanuun** - Severe irritation and stomach pain are symptoms, but can indicate many things other than poisoning.
*   **D: Dhalo kaniini ah oo dhakhtar qoray** - A prescribed medication isn't necessarily a sign of poisoning; it indicates a potential *source* if an overdose is suspected, but isn't a symptom itself.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, waa maxay talaabada koowaad ee ku haboon marka la qiimaynayo dhibbanaha?","The correct answer is **A: U fiirso goobta**.

The passage states: ""Si aad u eegto dulmanaha, waa inaad marka hore **aagga kormeertaa** si aad hubiso badbaadadaada."" This directly translates to ""To look at the injured person, you must first **inspect the area** to ensure your safety."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: U soo dhawow dhibbanaha** - The passage emphasizes safety *before* approaching.
* **C: Hubi booska dhibbanaha** -  This is about the victim's location, not the overall area safety.
* **D: Sug caawimaad** - While potentially necessary, the passage focuses on initial assessment *before* deciding to help or wait for help.



"
Keebaa weedhahan soo socda aan si sax ah uga tarjumeynin habka hubinta dhibbanaha?,"The correct answer is **A: Ha ka welwelin inaad usii adkaysato dhaawacyadaada**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes safety *for yourself* first.**  It warns against making the situation worse by attempting help without assessing the scene.  Option A suggests ignoring your own safety and potentially worsening injuries, which is the *opposite* of what the passage advises.

Let's look at why the other options are correct reflections of the passage:

* **B: Qiimee goobta ka hor dhibbanaha (Assess the scene before the victim):** This directly aligns with ""waa inaad marka hore aagga kormeertaa si aad hubiso badbaadadaada.""
* **C: U fiirso booska dhibbanaha (Be aware of the victim's location):** This aligns with ""Waxaad u baahan tahay inaad ogaato goobta dulmanaha markaad u tegayso.""
* **D: Isku day inaad u feejignaato calaamad walba oo cas (Try to be alert for any red flags):**  This aligns with ""inay jiraan wax calamo cas oo otomaatig ah.""

Isbadalada uu keenay Kacaankii Faransiiska kee baa saameyn weyn ku yeeshay muwaadiniinta dabaqada shaqaalaha?,"The correct answer is **B: Diiradda oo laga wareejiyay fasalka oo loo wareejiyay awood-kartiyed.**

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Kacdoonka ka dib shaqooyinka ayaa u furnaayeen dhamaan ragga soo codsaday taasi oo u ogolaatay in kuwa ogu hammiga badan oo na ogu guusha badan inay ku guuleystaan."" and ""ciidanka maxaa yeelay inta ciidanka lagu darajayn lahaa fasalka waxay ku salaysan yihiin nooca.""  This directly indicates a shift away from social class (fasalka) as the primary determinant of opportunity and towards merit and ability (awood-kartiyed).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Taageerada qaranka oo kordhay:** While nationalism was a result of the French Revolution, the text doesn't focus on how it *specifically* impacted workers.
*   **C: Qaadashada fikirka Jamhuuriga:**  The adoption of Republicanism is a broader outcome of the revolution; it doesn't directly address the improved opportunities for the working class.
*   **D: Nidaamka cabbiraadda cusub:** The text mentions the metric system, but this is a different aspect of the revolution and doesn't relate to worker advancement.



"
"Kacaankii Faransiiska ka dib, in guulo laga gaaro ciidamada iyo shaqooyinka kale maxaynan u badnayn in lagu saleeyay?","The correct answer is **C: Hami**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...taasi oo u ogolaatay in kuwa **ogu hammiga badan** oo na ogu guusha badan inay ku guuleystaan."" (which translates to ""...allowing those **most ambitious** and most successful to succeed."")  This directly links success in both the military and job opportunities to ambition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Guul gaarid (Achievement):** While achievement is *a result* of ambition, the passage emphasizes ambition as the *basis* for success.
*   **B: Fasal (Class/Rank):** The passage mentions rank in the military, but states it's based on *type* not ambition.
*   **D: Heer (Level):** Similar to achievement, level is a result, not the foundational quality mentioned in the text.



"
Waa kee adeegga dadwayne ee la sheegay in uu sababay ka xumaansho kii ugu badnaa ee dalalka horumaray?,"The correct answer is **C: Gaadiidka dadwaynaha**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states people *constantly complain* about the transportation system, drawing a contrast with complaints about water quality and crumbling bridges which are rare in developed countries. This points to transportation being the most common source of dissatisfaction within public services in the passage. 

The passage questions *why* the transportation system fails so often, implying it is the service causing the most widespread problems.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa laga dhihi karaa nidaamyada gaadiidka dadweynaha?","The correct answer is **C: Waxay sababtay cabasho badan oo ka timid dhanka dadka isticmaala**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Badanaa qof walba wuxuu ka cawda nidamaaka isu gudbida."" (Often everyone complains about the transport system). This directly indicates widespread dissatisfaction and complaints from users.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aad baa looga jecel yahay dhanka qof kasta oo isticmaala** - The text says the opposite - people *complain* about it.
*   **B: Ma ahan ku u liita sida tayada biyaha oo kale** - While the text *compares* transport issues to water quality issues, it doesn't say transport is *better*. It highlights that developed countries don't have the same complaints about water.
*   **D: Waa bilaash inta badan wadamada horumaray** - The text does not mention anything about the cost of transport.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwan soo socda kee ayaa adkaan kara in la qiyaaso sababtuna ay tahay in aan la saadaalin karin darawaliinta?","The correct answer is **A: Xawaaraha gaadiidka**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nasiib darro, barashada kala hagista baabuurtu ma fududa sababtoo ah hab dhaqanka dirawalka ayaan la saadaalin Karin boqolkiiba boqol.""  This directly links the difficulty in learning traffic flow to the unpredictability of **driver behavior**, which directly influences **speed**. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Qorshaynta waddada:** The text mentions that understanding traffic flow (which includes speed, flow, and density) *helps* with road planning.
* **C: Hawlgalada waddooyinka:** The text states understanding traffic flow aids in traffic operations.
* **D: Qulqulka gaadiidka:** While traffic flow is complex, the text states it can be expressed mathematically and is part of the three major patterns understood.  It's the *predicting driver behavior affecting speed* that's the difficult part.

Maxay Hershey iyo Chase isticmaaleen si ay u beeraan DNA-gooda? ,"The correct answer is **D: Fayrasyada**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hershey and Chase used **bacteriophages (viruses)** to infect bacteria."" They used these viruses as the vehicle (the 'how') to deliver the DNA into the bacteria.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fosfooraska shucaaca leh (Radioactive phosphorus):** While they *used* radioactive phosphorus to *label* the DNA, it wasn't what they used to *deliver* it. It was a marker.
*   **B: Walxaha hidda-socodka (Genetic material):** This is what they were studying (DNA), not what they used to get it into cells.
*   **C: Baaruud shucaac leh (Radioactive sulfur):** They used radioactive sulfur to label the protein, not the DNA delivery method.



"
The ability for a mutation to be passed on to offspring is dependent upon what?,"The correct answer is **A: Haddii unugyadu yihiin xariiq jeermis** (If the cells are germline).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Kaliya isbadalka unug yada germ-line oo kaliya ayee caruurtu dhaxli karaan"" - ""Only mutations in germline cells can be inherited by offspring.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Muhiimada walxaha hidde-sidaha** (The importance of the carrier material) - While the importance of the gene *affected* is relevant to the *impact* of a mutation, it doesn't determine *if* it's inheritable.
* **C: Nooca isku beddelka** (The type of mutation) - The type of mutation influences the *effect*, but not necessarily inheritance.
* **D: Haddii isbeddelku uu keeni karo dhimashada unugyada** (If the mutation can cause cell death) -  Cell death is a *result* of some mutations, but doesn't define whether it's passed on.  Only germline mutations are passed on, regardless of whether they cause cell death in somatic cells.



"
"Iyadoo lagu salaynayo macluumaadka lagu sheegay qoraalka, maxay saamaynaha kala duwan ee isu-beddelku aanay ku tiirsanayn?","The correct answer is **B: Haddii unugyada cudurka qaba ay yihiin xariiq jeermis** (Whether the affected cells are germ-line).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Kaliya isbadalka unugyadda germ-line oo kaliya ayee caruurtu dhaxli karaan"" (Only germ-line mutations can be inherited by offspring).  This means whether or not a mutation can be inherited *doesn't* depend on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected gene, or the extent to which the genetic material is affected – it depends solely on whether it's in the germline cells.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Intee in le'eg ayaa maaddada hidde-sidaha ay saamaysay** (How much of the genetic material was affected) - The text says the *importance* of the affected section matters, not necessarily *how much* is affected.
* **C: Muhiimadda maaddada hidde-sidaha ee ay saamaysay** (The importance of the genetic material affected) - While the text *does* mention importance, it's just one factor *among others* influencing the effect.  It doesn't say effects *don't* depend on this.
* **D: Nooca isku beddelka ee cudurka qaba** (The type of mutation) - The text directly states the effects vary *based on* the type of mutation.

The text states that players hit balls *into* holes, and complete the course by finishing all eighteen holes. The goal is implied to be completing the course using the *fewest* holes (strokes). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kubaddaha (Balls)** - While balls are used, the goal isn't to collect them.
*   **B: Istookis (Strokes)** - While strokes are how you move the ball, the ultimate goal is to finish the holes, not just make strokes.
*   **C: Waqti (Time)** - The text doesn't mention a time limit or that speed is a goal."
"Garoonka golf-ka, xagee cawska si gaaban lo jaray?","The correct answer is **B: Cagaarka korkiisa**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Cawskana godka ag dhowrna waa la gaabiyaa oo loo baxshaa cagaaar."" This directly translates to ""The grass around the hole is cut short and grown into green."" Therefore, the grass is cut short on the green."

The text states that while the scientific method is *important*, it's *not alone* in guiding scientific research. It specifically mentions that experience, experiments, questioning, and **observation** are also crucial. Therefore, relying *solely* on the scientific method wouldn't be sufficient.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Samaynta indho-indhayn (Making observations)** - The text explicitly says observations guide scientific research.
*   **C: Dabar jarka mala-awaalka suurtagalka ah (Disproving possible ideas)** -  The text states experimentation is used to eliminate ideas.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states that the *first telescopes* were made in Europe at the end of the 16th century.  Telescopes use a combination of lenses (which are related to but not the same as simple magnifying glasses/bikaacyada) to make distant objects appear closer and larger.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Isticmaalka muraayadaha (Using glasses/lenses)**: The text says people have been using magnifying glasses for *hundreds of thousands of years*.
* **B: Weynaynta walxaha (Magnifying things)**:  Again, this has been happening for a very long time, not just in the 16th century.
* **C: Samaynta muraayadaha (Making lenses)**: While lenses were necessary for telescopes, the passage doesn't say lenses themselves were *first* made in the 16th century.



"
Intee in le'eg ayay dadku waynaynayeen walxaha iyagoo isticmaalaya muraayadaha?,"The correct answer is **C: Kumanaan sanadood** (Thousands of years).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bini aadamku waxay bikaacyada sameynayeen una adeegsanayeen waynaynta kumanaan kun oo sannadood."" This directly translates to ""Humans have been making and using lenses for magnification for thousands of years.""

The question asks how long people have been magnifying things *using lenses*. The text confirms this has been happening for thousands of years.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kun sanadood** (One thousand years): While still a long time, it's not as accurate as ""thousands of years"" as stated in the text.
*   **B: Laga soo bilaabo dabayaaqadii qarnigii 16aad** (From the end of the 16th century): This refers to the *invention of telescopes*, not the general practice of magnification with lenses.

Here's why:

* **The text states Maxamed (Muhammed) regularly went to the cave ""Hiraa"" to *think*.** This implies he sought a quiet, isolated place for contemplation. 
* **The cave is described as secluded and difficult to find.** This reinforces the idea that he intentionally chose a place away from the bustle of everyday life.
* **The text mentions the cave provided him with *memories of his beloved and his religious devotion*.** This suggests a spiritual connection fostered through peaceful reflection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sawaxanka dibadda ayaa kaa caawin kara yogada (Outdoor exercise can help with yoga):** The text doesn't mention exercise or yoga.
* **C: Waxa uu u baahday wakhti aad u yar keligiis (He needed very little time alone):** The text says he *regularly* went to the cave, suggesting he needed considerable time alone.
* **D: Wuxuu aad uga welwelsanaa in la arko oo la maqlo (He was very worried about being seen or heard):** While the cave *is* hidden, the text doesn't state he was worried about being discovered. The emphasis is on the peaceful solitude it offered.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa birta loo isticmaali jiray marka hore?","The correct answer is **C: Taayirrada** (Wheels).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ugu dambayntii, taayiradii looxaha ahaa waxa lagu bedelay kuwo naxaas ah."" This translates to ""Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with bronze ones."" Therefore, bronze was first used for the wheels. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isgoysyada** - The text doesn't mention bronze being used for intersections.
*   **B: wagonways** - The text states wagonways were built with wood initially, then with rails. It does not mention using bronze for the wagonways themselves.
*   **D: Xadiidka** - The text mentions a railway made of iron later, but bronze came first for the wheels.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa taayirrada alwaaxda ahaa loogu badalay taayirro bir ah?","The correct answer is **C: Waxay awoodeen inay xamili karaan culaysyo waaweyn**.

Here's why:

The text states that wooden tires caused ""considerable wear and tear on the wagon wheels"".  This implies the wooden tires weren't durable enough. It then states that they were *eventually* replaced with iron tires.  The text doesn't mention speed increases, general usefulness, or tires being consumed by iron, but it *does* imply a need for something stronger to handle the weight and wear.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa qaabeeyay shakhsiyaadka inta lagu jiro xilliga Romanticismka?","The correct answer is **D: Dhaqanka**.

The text explicitly states that Romanticism was characterized by a strong cultural component drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel. It then goes on to say that things like a person's place of residence, local customs, and social understanding of a place are more important than imposed rules in shaping individuals.  This all points to **culture** being the formative influence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sharciga (Law)** - The text contrasts the importance of cultural influences *against* the imposition of laws.
*   **B: Juqraafiga (Geography)** - While place of residence is mentioned, it's as part of the cultural context, not as a direct shaper of personality.
*   **C: Kastamka (Customs)** - Customs are *part* of culture, but ""culture"" is the broader, more encompassing answer the text is describing."

*   **A: Tiknoolajiyada saamaynta ay ku leedahay bulshada ayaa ah mid si bulsho ahaan u shuruudaysan** - The text argues that technology's impact isn't a simple, direct ""impact *on* society"" but is *shaped by* societal factors – therefore, socially conditioned.
*   **C: Tiknoolajiyadu waxay saameyn qoto dheer ku leedahay bulshada** - The passage acknowledges technology has a ""profound"" impact.
*   **D: Horumarka tignoolajiyadu kuma salaysna saamayn siyaasadeed** - This aligns with the passage’s statement that technological growth proceeds separately from political influence.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwan soo socda keebaa aan la xiriirin jiidista qaansada?","The correct answer is **B: Astaan u eeg sida wax nagi**.

Here's why:

*   **The text describes ""kor u qalooca"" (upward stroke) as resembling the letter V and ""hoos u qalooca"" (downward stroke) as resembling a quarter circle.** It doesn't mention anything about it looking like wax (candle).
*   **""Cod jilicsan"" (soft sound)** is directly linked to upward strokes.
*   **""Cod xoogan"" (strong sound)** is directly linked to downward strokes.
*   **""Laga bilaabo rah"" (Starting from the top)** describes the direction of the upward stroke.

Therefore, the option that doesn't relate to the description of strokes is ""Astaanta u eeg sida wax nagi"" (symbol looking like wax)."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwan soo socda keebaa la xiriira dhawaqa dabacsan?","The correct answer is **C: Calaamad u eg sida V**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Xeego-sare badanaa waxay soo saartaa cod debecsan, halka xeego-hoose soo saarto cod xooggan oo sii qallafsan.""  And it defines ""kor u qalooca"" (which looks like a V) as a high note. Therefore, the V-shaped mark is associated with the softer sound.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Calaamadda qaanso ee hoose** - The text says *low* notes produce a strong, rough sound.
*   **B: Qaansada jiidaya** - This is a description of how to create the marks, not the sound they produce.
*   **D: Laga bilaabo meesha aad gacanta kaga hayso qaansada** -  This refers to the technique of drawing a low note, not the sound itself.

Kuwee haraaga noolaha ay tusinayaan in gacmihii ugu danbeyn la qabsadeen in ugu horayn loo isticmaalo?,"The correct answer is **A: Wax isdaba marin** (Tool use).

Here's why:

The passage states that the evolution of the human hand, specifically its shorter length and straighter thumb, is linked to a specialization *developed over millions of years* in using the hand for tool manipulation. The fossil record shows this change occurred *before* significant differences in leg length for bipedalism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Culays qaadida** - The passage states chimpanzee hands and legs are similar in size, implying they both were used for weight-bearing.
*   **C: meel socodka** - The passage explains hand evolution came *before* major changes related to walking.
*   **D: Farandulayn** - While hands can be used for climbing, the passage focuses on tool use as the driving force behind the hand’s evolution.

Kuwa soo socda kee baa si sax ah u qeexaya guruubyada daanyeerka chimpanzee? ,"The correct answer is **B: Gacmahoodu iyo cagahoodu way ku kala duwan yihiin cabbirka.**

Here's why:

The text specifically states that chimpanzees have arms and legs that are *equal* in size, indicating they use them for both locomotion (walking) and weight-bearing. This is contrasted with humans, whose arms are shorter than their legs.  This difference in limb proportions is a defining characteristic of chimpanzees compared to humans and their ancient ancestors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Way ka toosan yihiin dadka:** The text doesn't say anything about chimpanzees being more upright than humans.
*   **C: Waxaa loo isticmaalaa qaadista culayska:** While chimpanzees *can* use their hands for weight-bearing, the text emphasizes this is also true for their legs - unlike humans.
*   **D: Waxaa loo isticmaalaa ugu horreyn wax-is-daba-marin:** The text does not state that chimps use their hands primarily for manipulation. They use them for a variety of activities, including locomotion and support."
Xulashadu waxay meesha ka saaraysaa kala duwanaanshaha hidde-sideyaasha cusub ee kooxdee?,"The correct answer is **A: Qarsoon**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""doorashaduna waxay ka sii kaxaysaa berkedaas hiddesideyaasha aha"" which translates to ""and selection removes from that pool of latent factors"".  ""Qarsoon"" means latent or hidden, referring to the hidden variation. 

The other options don't fit the context:

*   **B: Dib u habeyn** (Re-establishment) - The passage doesn't talk about re-establishing anything.
*   **C: Kala soocida** (Separation) - While there's separation of pools, selection *removes* from the latent pool, not just separates it.
*   **D: Muujiyay** (Revealed) - The passage describes removing from the *hidden* pool, not the revealed ones.



"
Nidaamkee ayaa ka mas'uul ah in lagu daro kala duwanaanshiyaha hidda-socodka?,"The correct answer is **C: isku badelka** (Mutation).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Miyuutayshanku waxa uu soo saara nooc cusub oo hiddeside ah..."" This translates to ""Mutation produces a new type of hereditary material...""  This directly links mutation to the introduction of new variations in heredity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kala soocida** (Segregation): This refers to the separation of alleles during gamete formation, but doesn't *create* new variation.
* **B: Dib u habeyn** (Recombination):  This shuffles existing genetic material, but doesn't generate entirely new genetic information.
* **D: Muujiyay** (Expressed): This refers to the outward display of traits, not the origin of genetic variation.

"""Iyadoo lagu salaynayo macluumaadka ku jira qoraalka,Keebaa kuwan ay tahay in xayawaanku uu cuno si uu u xalliyo “dhibaatada borotiinka""""?""","The correct answer is **B: Iniinaha ceeriin**

Here's why:

The text states: ""The readily available plant sources may be leaf proteins and legumes, however, this is difficult for the most intelligent beings such as ourselves to digest unless cooked."" It then goes on to highlight the advantage of animal sources: ""...the food of animals (monkeys, termites, beef) is not only more digestible, but contains a high amount of protein that is composed of all the essential amino acids.""

While the text mentions legumes (which are plants), it specifically contrasts their digestibility and complete amino acid profile *with* animal sources like beef.  The text is referencing insects (termites) as an animal source that solves the protein problem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Caleemaha dhintay (Leaf proteins):** The text says these are *difficult* to digest.
*   **C: Kabajaan (Mushrooms):** The text does not mention mushrooms.
*   **D: Ubax afkoda (Flower buds):** The text does not mention flower buds.

*   Waa la sheegay in dhibaatooyinka dheefshiidku ka yimaadaan adkaanta dheefshiidka dhirta, taas oo aan si toos ah ula midhaysn la'aanta amino acids.

Sidaa darteed, dhibaatooyinka kale (nafaqo xumo, koritaanka liita, dhimasho) waa kuwo ka dhasha la'aanta amino acids muhiimka ah, laakiin dhibaatooyinka dheefshiidku waxay ka yimaadaan adkaanta dheefshiidka dhirta."

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Xubnaha dhaqan hoosaadku waxay badanaa xubinimadooda ku soo gudbiyaan adeegsi muuqda oo cad oo dhanka isteelka ah, kuwaas oo ay ka mid yihiin faashanka, dhaqamada, iyo aargoot."" This directly translates to members often express their affiliation through visible, symbolic practices like fashion, rituals, and symbols.  This is what ""habdhaqan ka turjumaya qaab kamida astaanta guud"" means - behavior that reflects a shared symbol or style.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ayadoo la isku dayayo inay ku dhex milmaan** - Subcultures often *distinguish* themselves, not blend in.
*   **B: Ayadoo la qaadanayo caqiidada qof kasta oo ku xeeran** - Subcultures often have beliefs *different* from mainstream society.
*   **C: Ayadoo la aqbalayo xeerarka bulshada** - Subcultures often form in response to feeling *excluded* by or disagreeing with societal norms.

Here's why:

The text states that when children are labeled with negative stereotypes based on their race/ethnicity, they are more likely to *perform poorly in school* after internalizing those beliefs. This implies that the negative labeling can *lead* to the behaviors predicted by the stereotype – in this case, underachievement, which could be seen as a ""khatar ah"" (dangerous/negative) path.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text doesn't say children try to avoid negative behaviors; it suggests they are *more likely* to exhibit them.
*   **C:** While children might navigate social situations differently, the text focuses on internalizing the stereotype and its effect on performance.
*   **D:** The text doesn't suggest children will reject people of the same race/ethnicity; it's about their own self-perception and performance.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, Aqoonta canugga ee fikradaha isirka ee saameyn ku yeelan kara kuwan soo socda waa midkee?","The correct answer is **D: Qeexitaankooda isir** (Their self-definition of race).

Here's why:

The passage states that children begin to develop racial awareness and racial identification at a very young age, and that this identification *impacts their behavior*.  The example given explicitly links a child's internalizing of negative racial ideas (being told their race is inferior) to their academic performance. This means their *understanding of their own racial identity* influences their outcomes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isirrada laga tirada badan yahay ee ay doortaan in lagu garto** (The races they choose to identify with) - The passage doesn't discuss children *choosing* a race, but rather *becoming aware* of their assigned race and the perceptions associated with it.
*   **B: Dabeecaddooda** (Their behavior) - The passage says racial identification *affects* behavior, but isn't the thing being influenced by awareness.
*   **C: Xiriirka ay la leeyihiin carruurta kale** (Their relationships with other children) - While racism can *affect* relationships, the passage focuses on the internal impact of racial awareness on the child themselves.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kee baa aan u badnayn in uu la jaanqaado barbaarinta ubadka waxshinimada ah?","The correct answer is **B: Xirfado wada hadal oo xoogan**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that children raised by animals exhibit behaviors (limited to physical abilities) *completely* resembling the animal that raised them, like their fears or a lack of concern for humans. This implies a *lack* of typical human social skills, including communication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: U noolaanshaha si madaxbanaan:** The text mentions children surviving independently in the wild, which is a component of the feral child experience.
*   **C: Dabeecadaha gooni socodka ah:**  Being ostracized or feeling like an outsider is *how* these children are categorized (""castaways"" or outsiders).
*   **D: Walaaca bulshada:** The text shows the negative consequences of lacking societal connections, but doesn’t imply those raised by animals would *possess* societal concern.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, Kuwa soo socda kee baa si sax ah u qeexaya dhaqanka waxshinimada ee carruurta?","The correct answer is **B: Dabeecadda waxshinimo waxay ka iman kartaa bulsho la'aanta.**

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states that children who are ""deprived, unfortunate, abused, or isolated from mainstream society"" are referred to as ""feral"" children. It goes on to say that these children, raised without regular human contact, can develop behaviors mirroring the animals that raised them or showing a lack of concern for humans. This directly links feral behavior to a lack of socialization.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Inta badan hab-dhaqanka waxshinimo waxaa sababa naafo jireed:** The text does mention physical abilities mimicking animals, but doesn't say physical disabilities *cause* the behavior.
*   **C: Dabeecadda waxshinimo waxay ku badan tahay oo keliya carruurta ay waalidkood xidheen:** The text lists several reasons for a child becoming feral, including abuse, abandonment, and being raised by animals, not just parental confinement.
*   **D: Dhammaan dabeecadaha waxshinimo waxaa sababa naafo maskaxeed oo daran:** The text suggests that some cases of child abandonment are related to parental mental illness, but does *not* state that all feral behavior is caused by severe mental disability.

Marka, beeraha quudka diirada saara wax soo saarka qoyska ayuu ku salaysnaa. Soo saarista cunto si loo iibiyo dadka kale waa ka soo horjeeda fikradda in la diirada saaro baahiyaha qoyska.

Halkan sababta kale ee jawaabaha kale aan loo dooran:

(Historically, many farmers have been involved in subsistence farming, and this is the case in many developing countries).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waa nidaam dabiici ah gebi ahaanba ah** (It is a completely natural system): The passage mentions using ""waxyaalaha dabiiciga ah"" (natural things) but also states the use of ""nidaamka isticmaalka siidhka asalka ah"" (basic fertilizer usage) and other techniques. So it's not *completely* natural.
*   **B: Waxay isticmaashaa farsamooyin gaar ah si ay u kordhiso dalagga** (It uses specific techniques to increase yield): While the passage mentions techniques to *increase* yield (crop rotation, etc.), the primary goal is self-sufficiency, not maximizing yield as in commercial farming.
*   **C: Waxay u ogolaataa beeralayda inay ku wadaagaan dalagyadooda dhamaan gobolkooda** (It allows farmers to share their crops with the entire region): The passage focuses on providing food for the farmer's family and doesn't mention widespread regional sharing.

The text states that ""Dalxiis Raaxo"" (Relaxation Tourism) is when people go somewhere very different from their everyday life to rest and rejuvenate. This directly points to the priority of escaping their daily routines.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku milmada dhaqanka deegaanka** - This describes *cultural tourism*, a different type of tourism.
*   **C: Aragtida calaamad-dhuleedyo muhiim ah** - The text doesn't mention landmarks as a priority for relaxation tourists.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sheekooyinkaas guusha waxay yareeyeen isbeddel ka cabsashadii, iyagoo isla markaana abuuraya isbeddel jacayl mustaqbalka ah."" This directly links the reduction in fear of change to stories of past successes in business.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Helitaanka aragtida fog ee dadka saameeya dhaqanka ururka** (Gaining insights from people influencing the culture of the organization) - While important, the text doesn't specifically say this reduced fear of change.
*   **C: Kashifida awooda riixaysa ururka** (Uncovering the driving forces of the organization) - This contributes to understanding, but not directly to reducing fear.
*   **D: Fahamka taariikhda ururka** (Understanding the history of the organization) - While valuable, the text highlights *success stories* within that history as the key to reducing fear of change."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, in qofku fahmo taariikhdiisa maxay bay ku caawin kartaa?","The correct answer is **C: Helitaanka inaa dareento booska ururka dhexdiisa** (Understanding one's place within the organization).

The text explicitly states: ""Iyadoo fahmista taariikhda qof aan loo qaadin fahamka dhaqankiisa, haddana ugu yaraan waxay qofka ka caawisaa inuu suureeyo halka u gelaayo taariikhda ururka.""  This directly translates to understanding where one fits into the organization's history.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Hoos u dhigida cabsida laga qabo isbeddelka** (Reducing fear of change): While the text mentions stories of success *reducing* fear of change, it doesn't say that understanding history *itself* does.
*   **B: Xoojinta qiyamka** (Strengthening values): The text mentions understanding values as a *result* of understanding history, but it's not the primary benefit stated.
*   **D: Hagaajinta hab-dhaqanka ganacsi** (Improving business practices): The text suggests past successes can *inform* current business, but understanding history doesn’t automatically improve practices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waayo-aragnimada waxbarashada qaarkood ayaa ka faa'iido badan kuwa kale:** While likely true, the passage doesn't focus on *degrees* of usefulness, but on the lack of a universal best approach.
*   **B: Waxbarashadu waa in diirada lagu saaro waxyaabaha aan aaminsanahay inaan la kulmi doono:** The passage actually *criticizes* this – it points out that much of what we learn in school we'll likely *never* use.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions drinking a lot of fluids (like water or tea) before bed to *force* you to wake up to urinate. This is a deliberate interruption of sleep.  Returning to bed immediately after using the bathroom links directly to that described method.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wax akhrinta saacad iyo badh ka hor intaadan dib u seexan** - Reading before bed is generally a relaxing activity and doesn't relate to the intentional waking discussed.
*   **C: Deminta alaarmiga koomadiinka saaran kadibna aad hurdada ku noqoto labaatan daqiiqo ka dib** - The passage describes *placing* the alarm far away, forcing you to get out of bed, not simply turning it off and returning to sleep.

"Marka ay maskaxdu isku dayayso inay had iyo jeer sharaxdo riyada, maxaa kordhaya?","The correct answer is **D: Waqtiga u dhexeeya xadiga ilmirigsiga indhaha**.

Here's why:

The passage explains that frequent lucid dreaming (caused by excessive use of Lucid Adder) increases the time spent in REM sleep. This means you're experiencing more dreams and the *time between* periods of restorative, deep sleep (where your body truly recovers) gets shorter. The analogy of waking up every 20-30 minutes while watching TV highlights how this shortened recovery time leads to feeling tired.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tirada xadiga ilmirigsiga indhaha** - While REM sleep involves eye movement, the passage isn't about the number of eye movements *increasing*, but rather the *time* between them being shortened due to more frequent dream cycles.
*   **B: Heerarka tamarta** - The passage specifically states this leads to *fatigue* and a lack of recovery, indicating energy levels would *decrease*, not increase.
*   **C: Dhererka xaaladda soo kabashada** - The passage indicates the *length* of the restorative sleep phase is *decreasing*, not increasing.

Here's why:

The passage directly states that frequent Lucid Dreaming (and the associated increased REM cycles) can *reduce* the amount of deep, restorative sleep.  REM sleep is when the eyes move rapidly. Therefore, reducing the amount of REM sleep is a direct negative impact related to the described problem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yaraynta inta u dhaxaysa xadiga ilmirigsiga indhaha** - This isn't directly addressed in the passage.
*   **C: Ku-tiirsanaanta riyada la dariimi karo** - While the passage discusses lucid dreaming, the *problem* isn't the dreaming itself, but the disruption of sleep caused by it.
*   **D: Kordhinta xadiga ilmirigsiga indhaha habenki** - The passage implies the opposite – that *too much* REM is the issue.

The passage states: ""Badanaa xoriyad ka badan xubnaha caadiga ah ee kooxda ayay leeyihiin maadaama laga yaabo in kooxdoodu kulanto iyagoo adeegsanaya aag waqtiyeedyo kala duwan taasoo laga yaabo inaanay fahmin maamulkooda guduhu.""  This directly translates to virtual teams having *more* autonomy than conventional (physical) teams.  Therefore, the opposite – conventional teams having *less* autonomy – is true.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kooxaha caadiga ah waxa badanaa lagu hayaa heer ka sareya** - The passage states they are held to the *same* standards, not a higher one.
* **B: Kooxaha gacan ku samaysku inta badan waxay u dhaqmaan sida rugta lagala xidhiidho kooxaha caadiga ah** - While the passage mentions the importance of connection, it doesn't say they function *as* a substitute for physical teams.
* **D: Aagagga wakhtiyada kala duwan waxay faaiido u noqotaa kooxaha gacan ku samayska ah** - While true, this isn't a contrast between the two team types as the question asks, but rather a characteristic *of* virtual teams.

Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan ahayn shayga qaanuunka sadexlayda?,"The correct answer is **D: Aasaasida amar gudaha sawirka**.

Here's why:

* **The Rule of Thirds** focuses on *composition* - where to place elements within the frame to create balance and interest. It's about visual weight and guiding the viewer's eye. The options A, B, and C all contribute to that compositional goal.
    * **A: Abuuritaanka meel sal u ah rugta mawduuca la dhigi karo** - (Creating a base for the room the subject can inhabit) - relates to placement within the thirds.
    * **B: Abuuritaanka nolosha iyo tamarta gudaha sawirka** - (Creating life and energy within the image) -  A well-composed image *feels* more dynamic.
    * **C: Ku haynta mawduuca meel gaar ah oo waxtar leh** - (Keeping the subject in a specific, effective place) - This is directly about using the intersection points or lines of the rule of thirds.

* **D: Aasaasida amar gudaha sawirka** - (Establishing order within the image) – While good composition *contributes* to a sense of order, it's not the core principle of the rule of thirds. Order can be achieved through various other techniques (symmetry, leading lines, etc.).  The rule of thirds is specifically about dividing the image and placing elements *off-center* which can actually be perceived as less rigid than perfect symmetry and might not be strictly about ""order"" in that sense.

Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan qeexin qaabka sawir qaadista 35mm?,"Jawaabta saxda ah waa **C: Waxay leedahay saami cabir oo ka duwan qaabab badan oo caan ah.**

Halkan sababta:

Qoraalku wuxuu sheegay in 35mm dhab ahaantii waa 36mm ballac iyo 24mm dherer, taasoo ka dhigaysa saamigeedu 3:2. Wuxuuna sheegay in qaabab badan oo caan ah (APS tusaale) ay la mid yihiin ama aad ugu dhow yihiin saamigan. Markaa, in ay leedahay saamiga cabir ee ka duwan qaababka caanka ah waa been, waxaana qoraalku tilmaamayaa in ay aad ugu dhow yihiin.

Halkan sababta jawaabaha kale ay ku haboonayn:

*   **A: Wali waxay ku jirtaa soo saaris:** Qoraalku wuxuu sheegay in 35mm wali la soo saaro.
*   **B: Waxaa lagu qaatay qaababka kamaradaha dhijitaalka ah:** Qoraalku wuxuu sheegay in saamigeedii qaabeed uu dhaxlay nooca sawir dareeme ee kamarada dhijitaalka ah.
*   **D: Waa qaabka ugu caansan aduunka:** Qoraalku wuxuu sheegay in sawirka ugu caansan lasawirey wuxuu ahaa 35mm, taas oo muujineysa in ay tahay qaab caan ah."

This directly explains that improved manufacturing of high-quality lenses has allowed zoom lenses to produce image quality comparable to fixed focal length lenses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waxay leeyihiin xawaare sare oo muraayadeed** - The text actually says zoom lenses *often have lower* maximum apertures (slower speed).
*   **B: Way fududahay in lagu isticmaalo xaaladaha iftiinka hooseeya** - The text indicates the opposite - they are *more difficult* to use in low light.
*   **D: Waxay leeyihiin kakanaanta diiradda ka yar marka loo eego muraayadaha asaasiga ah** - The passage focuses on the complexity of achieving focus, and does not suggest zoom lenses have *less* focus difficulty than prime lenses."

Here's why:

The text states that a disadvantage of zoom lenses (which are ""soo dhawaysada"" - converging/zoom lenses) is that they often have a *lower* maximum aperture (f-stop).  A lower maximum aperture means they perform *worse* in low-light situations. Therefore, if you *don't* want to use flash in low-light, a prime (fixed focal length) lens would be preferable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Haddii daloolka ugu sarreeya uu yahay mudnaanta:** The text states zoom lenses have *lower* maximum apertures, making them a poor choice if a large aperture is important.
*   **B: Haddii aad rabto canaasiirta muraayadaha yar:** The text explains zoom lenses *require* more elements than prime lenses.
*   **D: Haddii aad raadinayso suuxidda diiradeed ee kooban:** Zoom lenses are specifically useful for *varying* focal length, not having a limited one."

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Sufism *distinguishes itself* from other religions through its emphasis on personal experience and how that experience fosters specific qualities like peace, compassion, and joy.  Option D directly contradicts this by saying the focus on personal experience is *common* to many other faiths.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with the text:

* **A:** The passage describes Sufism as valuing states of peace and compassion in consciousness.
* **B:**  The passage mentions the seeker of Sufism looking for guidance towards what they worship, implying a search for spiritual truth.
* **C:**  The passage states that followers adopt practices to cultivate those experiences.

The text states: ""Aragtidu waxay salka u dhigtay fikradda ah in dadka Maori ay ka so guureen Polynesia iyaga Safar Wayn ah kana qaadeen New Zealand Moriori, halkaasna ka sameeyeen bulsho beeralay ah.""  This originally believed that the Maori found the Moriori and they created an agricultural society. 

However, the text *later* clarifies that Moriori actually came *from* New Zealand *to* the Chatham Islands, and it was there they developed a peaceful lifestyle. This suggests the agricultural society was built on the Chatham Islands by the Moriori.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Moriori oo ka soo jeeda New Zealand:** While they *originated* in New Zealand, the text indicates the agricultural society developed on the Chatham Islands.
*   **C: Dadka Maori ee ka soo jeeda Polynesia:** The text states they originally came from Polynesia but didn't build a farming society with the Moriori.
*   **D: Maori oo ka soo jeeda dhul weynaha:** While some Maori travelled to the Chatham Islands, the text specifies the *Moriori* were the ones who settled there and established a peaceful existence.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Pureland origami focuses on making *only one fold at a time* and avoids complex folds. This means it’s beneficial for people who prefer a simpler, step-by-step approach where they focus on completing one fold perfectly before moving on to the next.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Galku waxa uu leeyahay xirfado dhaqaaq oo horumarsan** - Pureland origami was *designed* for people *without* advanced skills.
*   **C: Galku waxa uu abuurayaa qaab origami oo u baahan laalaabyo dhanka kale ah** - Pureland origami specifically *avoids* complex folds like reverse folds.
*   **D: Galku waxa uu isku dayay kaliya hal ama laba jeer ka hor** - The purpose was to help beginners or those with limited experience, not those who have barely tried at all.

The text specifically states: ""...it is also called the Harappan civilization, *named after Harappa, which was the first site in the region to be excavated in the 1920s*."" This directly links Harappa as the site that gives the civilization an alternate name, making it a key point of reference.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Wabiga Sarasfati:** The text mentions the Sarasvati river as a possible area where the civilization existed, but it isn't the site that the civilization is named after.
*   **C: Dhammaan gobollada waqooyi bari ee Afgaanistaan:** The text states the civilization *included* parts of northeast Afghanistan, but it wasn't centered there.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

The text explicitly states that ""when self-interest is practiced, there will also be other benefits gained in the short term."" This directly links focusing on immediate gains to acting in one's own self-interest.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Is xilqaan (Responsibility):** Responsibility wouldn't prioritize short-term benefits.
*   **B: Wada shaqayn (Cooperation):** The text implies cooperation is better in the *long* term, not for immediate gains.

Here's why:

The passage states the High Middle Ages were the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD). The Knights Templar flourished *during* the High Middle Ages, specifically becoming prominent in the 12th and 13th centuries. Therefore, something ""before"" them would be earlier in the Middle Ages - the Early Middle Ages.
"
Waqtigee ayaa yimid kadib casriga farda fuuladii Templars-ka?,"The correct answer is **A: Dhamaadka Qarniyadii Dhexe**.

* The passage states the High Middle Ages (roughly 11th-13th centuries) were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.  The Templars were a significant force *within* the High Middle Ages. Their decline and dissolution happened towards the end of the Middle Ages (early 14th century).

The text specifically mentions that Roman doctors used pain relievers derived from fruits. While these could have been used for various ailments, the context focuses on their expertise in herbal remedies and pain management. There is no mention within the text of a specific treatment for mental illness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

Waa maxay waxa ay ku tiirsan tahay kala duwanaanshaha qaab dhismeedka isha ee u dhexeeya noolaha?,"The correct answer is **B: Shuruudaha noolaha**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the structure of the eye varies based on ""the needs of the organism"" (or ""unugyada loo baahan yahay"" in the original Somali text).  Different eye structures have different capabilities related to motion detection, detail, and light levels, and these capabilities are tied to what the organism *needs* to survive and thrive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dareenka dhererka hirka (Perception of linear height)** - This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Heerka afaysan (Level of fluency)** - This doesn't relate to eye structure or animal needs.
*   **D: Kakanaanta noolaha (Inertia of the organism)** - While inertia is a physical property, it isn't the driving force behind variations in eye structure as described in the passage.

Wuxuu ka hadlayaa sida kaabaha ay u noqon karaan mala-awaal iyo xaqiiqo, iyo in macalinka (kaabaha) uu noqon karo ""kilab warqadeed"" marka la isticmaalayo qalab sida Microsoft Office.  Wuxuu intaa ku darayaa in kaabaha ay u badan tahay inay yihiin caawimaad ka sokow waxbarasho.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, sifadee ayay MySpace kaga faa'iidaysan karta ardayda dhibku ka haysto akhriska?","The correct answer is **C: Hal ciwaan shabakad** (One web address).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Boggan waxa lagu geli karaa adoo qoraya hal ciwaan websayt keliya, kaasoo uu fududyahay xasuusashadiisu una fudud ardayda inay qoraan kuwaasoo laga yaabo inay qoraalka iyo higaadu ku adkaato."" This directly explains that having only one web address to remember is a benefit specifically for students who struggle with spelling and writing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku koobid** (Conciseness) - While the text mentions options to make reading easier, conciseness isn't the primary way MySpace helps students with reading difficulties.
*   **B: Goob internet** (Website) - This is too general; the question asks *how* MySpace helps, not *what* it is.
*   **D: 54 milyan oo borofayl** (54 million profiles) - This is a statistic about the site's popularity, not a feature that helps students with reading.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, midkee kuwan soo socda aan qayb ka ahayn jawaabta Krushchev ee rabshadaha shaqaalaha?","Jawaabta saxda ah waa **C: Kordhitanka dhimista mushaharka**.

Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa in shaqaalaha ay mudaharaad ka sameeyeen ""cunto yari iyo mushahar dhimis"", laakiin ma sheegin in Krushchev uu mushaharka sii jaray. Xitaa wuxuu aqbalay ""baahiyo dhaqaale"", taas oo ka dhigan inuu wax ka beddelay siyaasaddii hore.

Kuwa soo socda kee baa sabab u ahayn rabshadihii ka dhacay Poland?,"The correct answer is **D: Magacaabida Wladyslaw Gomulka**.

Here's why:

The passage states the protests *led to* Gomulka being appointed prime minister. It wasn't a cause of the initial unrest, but a *result* of it. 

The passage explicitly links the unrest to:

*   **Food shortages (B)**
*   **Wage cuts (C)**
*   And generally opposition to **Communism (A)** – which is implied by the protests against a communist regime."

Laakiin qoraalku wuxuu si gaar ah u sheegaa in fikradaha ku saabsan Jarmalka ay gacan ka geesteen in Maraykanku iyo Ruushku ay isku bahaystaan ​​markii hore, sidaas darteed waxa ugu badan inaysan saameyn ku yeelanin xiriirka ka dhexeeya labada dal.

Halkan ayaa ah sababta jawaabaha kale aan saxeexayn:

*   **A: Kala duwanaanshaha dhaqanka** - Qoraalku si cad u sheegayaa in kala duwanaanshaha dhaqanka ay keentay kala tagga.
*   **B: Fikradaha ku saabsan Jarmalka** - Qoraalku waxa uu sheegayaa in fikradaha ku saabsan Jarmalka ay sabab u ahaayeen in labada dal isku xidhiidhaan.

Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan si sax ah u qeexin ujeedada loo dirayo neerfe dareemayaasha dhamaan jirka oo dhan?,"The correct answer is **A: Qulqulka dhiiga oo yaraada**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Handhiska Neerfayaashu *increases* blood flow (dhiiga u socodsiiyo) and sends nerve signals throughout the body to prepare it for danger.  Reducing blood flow (ququlka dhiiga oo yaraada) would be the *opposite* of its function, and therefore not a correctly stated purpose of sending nerve signals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maareynta qulqulka dhiigga (Managing blood flow):** This is *part* of what it does, but it's not the whole purpose of sending the nerve signals. The signals are to prepare for a response to danger.
* **C: Ilaalinta isu dhelitiranka cunsarada (Maintaining balance of elements):** The passage focuses on water balance and the body's response to threats, not elemental balance.
* **D: Ka fogaanshaha khataraha jirka ee iman kara (Avoiding future physical dangers):**  The passage says the nerve signals help the body *respond* to danger, not avoid it entirely.  It's about immediate reaction, not prevention.

Maxaa laga heli karaa kurta Giza?,"The correct answer is **D: Haramka Wayn**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Giza Plateau, ama “Arhaamta Masar” ee ku Masar taas oo ka kooban arhamo kala duwan... Ahraamta waawayn waxaa loo sameeyay in lagu maamuso Pharaoh Khufu...""  The Giza Plateau *is* the location of the Great Pyramid (Ahraamta waawayn) and other pyramids, collectively known as the Haramka Wayn (Pyramid Complex).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Qubuuro** - While there are tombs *within* the pyramids, the plateau itself is not just a collection of tombs.
*   **B: Macbadyo** - The text mentions temples, but they are *part of* the larger pyramid complex.  It's not the primary thing you find at Giza.
*   **C: Dhammaan toddobada mucjiso ee dunida** - The text does not state that Giza contains all seven wonders of the ancient world. The Great Pyramid *was* one of the Seven Wonders, but not all of them are located at Giza.



"
Maxay ahayd ujeedada Haramka Wayn?,"The correct answer is **B: Si loo sharfo Fircoon**.

The text states: ""Ahraamta waawayn waxaa loo sameeyay in lagu maamuso Pharaoh Khufu"" which translates to ""The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu."" This directly indicates the purpose of the Great Pyramid was to honor the Pharaoh.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Si uu u noqdo mid ka mid ah toddobada mucjiso ee adduunka** - The text does not mention anything about the seven wonders of the world.
*   **C: Si ay ugu muuqato astaan muuqaal dhuleed** - While the pyramids are visually striking, the text focuses on their purpose of honoring the Pharaoh.
*   **D: In lagu kaydiyo xabaalaha dadkii dhintay** - While pyramids *contain* tombs, the primary purpose was to honor the Pharaoh, not just store bodies. They were elaborate monuments to their reign."
Yaa mas'uul ka ah marka loo eego aqoontena aan u leenahay dab-qabayaashii burburiyay macbadka?,"The correct answer is **A: Efsiis**.

Here's why:

The text states that the Temple of Artemis was burned down by Herostratus, and the Ephesians (the people of Ephesus) were the ones who were angered by the act. It was Herostratus who did the deed, but the question asks who was responsible according to the text. 

Let's look at why the other answers are incorrect:

*   **B: Aleksandarkii Waynaa** - He offered to rebuild it, he didn't destroy it.
*   **C: Istraabo** - He was a historian who *recorded* the name of the arsonist, he didn't commit the act.
*   **D: Artemis** - She was the deity the temple was dedicated to; she didn't destroy her own temple."
Waa kee bayaanka saxda ah oo ku saabsan dib u dhiska macbudka Artemis?,"The correct answer is **B: Waxaa dib loo dhisay ka dib Casrigii Alexander-ka Waynaa**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that Alexander offered to fund the rebuilding but was *rejected*.
*   It then says the temple was rebuilt *after* Alexander died (in 323 BC).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** Alexander did *not* pay for the rebuilding.
*   **C:** Herostratus was the *destroyer* of the temple, not the funder of its reconstruction.
*   **D:** While the text gives the year 323 BC for the rebuilding, it doesn’t directly state 320 BC. Option B provides a more accurate description based on the timing in the text."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, goorma ayay ahayd markii ugu horreysay ee nooc laga yaabo inuu ku socdo laba lugood?","The correct answer is **A: Todoba milyan oo sano ka hor**.

The text states: ""in kastoo laga yaabo in Sahelanthropus ay laba lugood ku socdeen ilaa iyo 7 milyan oo sannadood ka hor."" This means the earliest *possible* time a species might have walked on two legs is 7 million years ago."
Midkee ka mid ah noocyadan baa si joogto ah ugu socday laba cagood?,"The correct answer is **B: Homo Erectus**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Homo Erectus (meaning upright man) began to walk fully upright two million years ago."" This directly indicates they were the first to walk consistently upright.
* **Sahelanthropus:** The passage suggests they *may* have walked on two legs up to 7 million years ago, but it's not definite (""may have"").
* **Australopithecus:** The passage says they ""did not generally walk upright.""
* **Bipedal specializations:** This isn't a species, but a characteristic.

Maxay ahaayeen ciidamada badda ee Jarmalku waxa ay isku dayayeen in ay qabtaan intii lagu jiray Dagaalkii labaad ee dunida?,"The correct answer is **A: Jidgooyada alaabta ka imanaysa Ingiriiska** (Blocking supplies to England).

Here's why:

The passage states that German U-boats tried to ""stop the shipment"" of goods from America to England. This directly translates to attempting to blockade or interrupt the flow of supplies to England.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ka-hortagga in Ingiriisku ay hesho dadka iyo badeecadaha** (Preventing England from getting people and goods) - While this is a result of the blockade, the *attempt* was specifically to stop supplies.
*   **C: Dhoofinta alaabada ayagoo jaraya badweynta Atlantiga** (Exporting goods by cutting across the Atlantic) - This is the opposite of what the German U-boats were doing.
*   **D: Ka-hortagga Ameerika inay hesho dadka iyo badeecadaha** (Preventing America from getting people and goods) - The primary goal wasn't to stop goods *to* America, but to stop goods *from* America *to* England."
"Iyada oo lagu saleynayo macluumaadka lagu xusay qoraalka, yaa ugu guulaha badnaa dagaalka badda intii lagu jiray Ololihii Waqooyiga Atlantiga?","The correct answer is **A: Ingiriiska iyo Maraykanka**.

Here's why:

The text states that the US was trying to get supplies and men *to* England across the Atlantic. It also states that if the naval escorts (implying the US and British navies) had failed, Germany could have captured England. This clearly indicates that the combined efforts of England and the US were successful in preventing Germany from disrupting the supply lines and potentially conquering England.  While the German U-boats *tried* to stop the convoys, the text implies they ultimately failed to do so effectively enough to alter the course of the war."
Maxaa aan jirin markii Aashuuriyiintu ay hirgeliyeen adeegsiga fardooleyda?,"The correct answer is **A: koore**.

The text specifically states: ""Kooraha weli lama ikhtiraacin, markaan fardooladii Asiiriyaanku waxay ku dagaalami jireen fardaha oo caddaysimo ah."" This translates to ""Saddles had not yet been invented, so the Assyrian cavalry fought on bareback horses.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Qaansada:** The text mentions ""qaansada"" (reins) but states they *were* used (""Fallaadhaha ka soo dhacaya qaansooyinkooda isku tallaabta ah..."")
*   **C: Gaadhifarasyo:** The text discusses chariots (""gaari-farasyadii Asiiriyaanka"") and how cavalry made them less useful.
*   **D: Dirac bireed:** The text mentions armor (""gaashaanka iyo diracyada askarta"") but doesn't say it was missing."
Sidee loo dagaallamaa dagaalladii loo adeegsado fardoolayda?,"The correct answer is **C: Faraska korkiisa**.

The text states: ""Fardoolay waa ciidan ku kor dagaalama fardaha guudkooda."" This directly translates to ""Cavalry is a force that fights *on top of* their horses.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lug ku taagnid (Foot fighting)** - The text specifically describes a force *on horses*.
*   **B: Dirac bireed la,aan (Without breastplate)** - While the text mentions armor, it doesn't describe *how* they fight.
*   **D: Askar yar (Few soldiers)** - The text doesn't talk about the size of the cavalry force."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, halkeed ka heli kari weyday celcelis ahaan muwaadin reer Baabiloon ah?","The correct answer is **D: Keenista allabaryo gudaha mowlaca** (Bringing offerings inside the sanctuary).

The text states: ""Dadku waxay sadaqo u keeni jireen sanamyada wadaaduna waxay isku dayi jireen inay daboolaan baahiyaha sanamyada iyagoo adeegsanaya xaflado iyo sabyaal."" and ""...kanisad kasta waxay leedahay goob beereed furan kadibna gudaha waxay ku ledahay goob nabdoon taasi oo ay galikaraan karo kaliya wadaadadu.""

This indicates that regular citizens would make offerings at the *outer* courtyard, but only priests could access the *inner sanctuary* (mowlaca) to address the needs of the idols.  Therefore, a typical Babylonian citizen couldn't bring offerings directly *inside* the sanctuary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Keenida allabaryo barxadda macbudka:** The text specifically says people *did* bring offerings to the temple courtyard.
*   **B: Ka qayb galka xaflada macbudka aasaasiga ah:** The text mentions ceremonies and festivals, implying citizens participated.
*   **C: Xiliga iidda ee barxadda macbudka:** Like B, this suggests participation in public temple activities.

Kuwa soo socda kee baa si gaar ah loogu talagalay wadaaddada kaniisada?,"The correct answer is **B: Mowlacyo gudaha ah**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kanisad kasta waxay leedahay goob beereed furan kadibna gudaha waxay ku ledahay goob nabdoon taasi oo ay galikaraan karo kaliya wadaadadu.""  This ""goob nabdoon"" is specifically for the priests and is located *inside* the temple.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Damaashaadka** - The passage mentions ceremonies and festivals, but these aren't exclusive to priests.
*   **C: Xafladaha** - Similar to festivals, these were for broader worship and not solely for priests.
*   **D: Dhismaha Ziguratka** - The Zigurat was the temple's foundation, but not a space exclusively for priests.

Goorma ayuu Boqor Tutankhamun caan noqday?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka dib markii la helay qabrigiisa**.

The passage states: ""However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous."" This directly answers the question of when Tutankhamun became famous."
Maxaa Boqor Tutankhamun ka dhigay boqor Masari ah oo caan ah?,"The correct answer is **A: Daahfurkii qabrigiisa oo aan qasnayn** (The discovery of his untouched tomb).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""In kastoo qabriyo badan horey loo boobay, qabrigan waxa laga tagay isagoon la taaban."" (Although many tombs had been looted before, this tomb was left untouched.) and ""helistii la helay qabrigiisa 1922 ayaa caan ka dhigtay."" (the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Maqaamkiisa ee liisaska boqoradii hore** (His status on ancient king lists) - The passage states he wasn't even *on* those lists for a long time.
*   **C: Dhaca kumanyaal agab oo qabrigiisa laga dhacay** (The finding of thousands of items in his tomb) - While the items were important, it was the *discovery* of the intact tomb that made him famous.
*   **D: Muhiimadda uu lahaa xilliyadii hore ee Masaarida** (His importance in ancient Egyptian times) - The passage says he wasn't considered particularly important for a long time."
Gabayaaga Giriigga ee Homer muxuu awoodikari waayay inuu sameeyo?,"The correct answer is **A: Maqal (Hear)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Homer is a legendary poet who *embodies* Greek knowledge through his poems, the Iliad and Odyssey. It doesn't say anything about his physical abilities being limited. However, Homer is traditionally believed to be blind. Therefore, he wouldn't have been able to **hear** effectively. 

The passage does not mention any limitations to Homer's sight, walking or speaking. The question aims to trick you into focusing on what *is* said about Homer, rather than common knowledge about him."
Giriiggee caan ah ee lagu yaqaan wax aan suugaanta ahayn?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagorus**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states that Pythagorus was a mathematician known for his famous idea about the relationship between the sides of a right triangle (the Pythagorean theorem). This is *not* related to literature, unlike Homer, Sophocles, and Aristophanes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sophocles** - The passage identifies Sophocles as a playwright (a part of literature).
*   **B: Homer** - The passage states Homer is a poet (literature).
*   **D: Aristophanes** - The passage identifies Aristophanes as a playwright (literature)."
Halkee ayay qoyska Cibriyiinta ku qaadan jireen wakhtigooda intiisa badan?,"The correct answer is **A: Hawada furan**.

Maxaa aan aad muhiim ugu ahayn qoyska Cibriga?,"The correct answer is **C: Hoygooda (Their homes)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Cimilada diirran ee Bariga Dhexe, **gurigu sidaas muhiim uma ahayn**."" This directly translates to ""In the warm climate of the Middle East, **the home was not so important**.""

The passage goes on to explain *why* homes weren't a priority - life happened outdoors. The other options are mentioned in the text, but aren't the answer to what wasn't important to the Hebrew family.

Kooxdee ayaa doorbidaysa inay wax ku cunaan kuraas la'aan?,"The correct answer is **C: Nimanka Roomaanka ee hodanka ah**.

The passage states: ""fuqarada iyo dumarku cuntadooda cuneen iyagoo ku fadhiya kuraasi, halka ragii qaniga ahaa door bideen inay casho fiican wada qaataan iyagoo dhinac-dhinac u jiifa."" This means wealthy Roman men preferred to eat lying down *without* chairs.
"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan ka mid noqon doonin waliimooyinkii hore ee Roomaanka?,"The correct answer is **D: Saxan diiq turki ah oo duban**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the Romans *did not have* turkey and therefore would not have eaten a roasted turkey dish. 

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with the text:

*   **A: Martida faqiirka ahi waxay wax ku cunayan kuraasta** - The passage says the poor ate while seated on chairs.
*   **B: cunto badeed yar oo hormaris ah** - The passage mentions unusual foods like dormice, which could be considered appetizers.
*   **C: Niman hodan ahi oo iskala bixiyaan inta lagu gudo jiray cashada** - The passage describes wealthy Romans reclining while eating.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that ""small cultures often disappear without leaving much traceable history and are now not recognized as being proper civilization.""  This directly implies that small cultures are unlikely to have a lasting impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bulshada (Society):** The entire text *defines* civilization as a shared culture among a society.
*   **C: Magaalo-goboleed (City-States):** The text contrasts city-states with nations, establishing them as a significant historical and social structure.
*   **D: Dhaqan ilbaxnimo (Civilization):** The text is *about* civilization and its enduring nature (""knowledge passed down through generations"").

Therefore, the answer is **B**."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa ummad ka horrmara?","The correct answer is **C: Magaalo-goboleed**.

The text states: ""Maamulada-Magaaloyin ayaa horjeege qaramada."" This translates to ""City-states preceded nations.""

Weedhee ayaa si sax ah u qeexaysa natiijada dabka Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **A: Waxa kaliya ee haray waa sawirka Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal**.

The passage states: ""1951 kii, ayaa dab waxooga asaartii Drukgyal Dzong ah oo qura soo reebay, sawirkaas oo kale ayuu lahaa Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel."" This directly supports answer A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ciidamada Tibetan-Mongol waxa ay ahaayeen kuwa guulaystay** - The passage states the dzong was built *to commemorate a victory* over Tibetan-Mongol forces, not their success.
*   **C: Soo jiidashada shacbiyadeed maysan saameyn** - The passage states it *became* a popular tourist attraction *after* the fire, implying the fire did impact its popularity.
*   **D: Waxaa xafiday Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel** - While he built the original dzong, the passage says it was *preserved and cared for* after the fire, but doesn't state he was the one who did it."

The passage states: ""Thais wuxuu weeraray Cambodia dhawr jeer intii lagu jiray qarnigii 18aad iyo 1772 waxay burburiyeen Phnom Phen."" This directly supports the statement that the Thais destroyed Phnom Penh.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fiitnaamiisku waxay burburiyeen Phnom Penh** - The passage doesn't mention the Vietnamese destroying Phnom Penh, only entering Cambodia at the end of the 18th century.
*   **B: Kambodiya waxay ku soo duushay Taylaan 1772** - The passage says the Thais attacked Cambodia, not the other way around.
*   **C: Kambodiya waxa ku soo duulay Fiitnaamiiska bilawgii qarnigii 18aad** - The passage says the Vietnamese entered Cambodia *at the end* of the 18th century, not the beginning."

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Thais wuxuu weeraray Cambodia dhawr jeer intii lagu jiray qarnigii 18aad"" (The Thais attacked Cambodia several times during the 18th century).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage only mentions Vietnamese entering Cambodia at the *end* of the century, not multiple invasions.
*   **B:** While the passage mentions 1772, it was the year the Thais destroyed Phnom Penh, not a general timeframe for both countries' invasions.
*   **C:** The passage states the Thais destroyed Phnom Penh, not the Vietnamese.

* **D: Rabitaanka inay xukunka Taywaan uga tanasulaan boqortooyada qoyska Jing** - Dukumentigu ma sheegayo in Shirkadda Dutch ee Bariga Hindiya ay doonayeen inay xukunka Taywaan ka tanaasulaan. Xukunka ayaa laga wareejiyay iyada oo loo maray dagaal iyo heshiis, laakiin ma aysan ahayn arrin ay Holandaanku iska doonayeen."
Muxuu aasaasay Heshiiskii Shimonoseki?,"The correct answer is **A: Guuldaradii Japan ee dagaalkii ugu horeeyay ee Shiinaha iyo Japan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sanaddii 1895tii, kadib guurdaradii Dagaalki koowaad ee shiinaha iyo Jabaaniiska, xukuumadda Qing waxay saxiixday heshiiska Shimonoseki ee madaxbanaanida Taiwan loogu wareejinayay Jabaan...""

This clearly indicates that the Treaty of Shimonoseki was a direct result of China's defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War. The treaty ceded Taiwan to Japan as a consequence of that defeat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage states Taiwan *became* a province of the Qing dynasty *before* the treaty, not that the treaty established that.
*   **C:** The treaty resulted in Taiwan *leaving* Chinese control, not regaining coastal areas.
*   **D:** The treaty *gave* Japan control of Taiwan, it wasn't about Japan already having authority.

Sidee loo cabbiraa heerka pH ee kiimikada?,"The correct answer is **C: Qadarka ions,ka Haydarjiinka ee ku jira maadada kiimikada** (The amount of hydrogen ions in the chemical substance).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Heera pH ka waxa muujiya inta Hydrogen ah (H ta ku jirta pH) ee ku jirta kiimikada la tijaabiyay.""  This directly translates to ""pH level shows the amount of Hydrogen (H in pH) in the tested chemical.""  Hydrogen ions *are* what pH measures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sidee bay kiimikadu aasaas u tahay ama aysiidh u tahay** (How acidic or basic the chemical is) - This is what pH *tells* you, but it's not *how* you measure it.  The question asks about the measurement process.
* **B: Immisa borotoono ayaa ku jira maadada kiimikada** (How many protons are in the chemical substance) - While hydrogen ions are protons, pH doesn't measure the *total* number of protons, but specifically the *ions* (charged particles) of hydrogen.
* **D: Immisa elektaroonig ah ayaa ku jira maadada kiimikada** (How many electrons are in the chemical substance) -  The number of electrons is not directly related to the pH measurement.



"
"Maxaa laga saaray ions,ka Haydarjinka?","The correct answer is **D: Elektaroono**.

The text states: ""Hydrogen ions waa borotons laa saaray **elektoroniska** (madama unug yada ugu yar ee hydrogen-ka ay ka kooban yihiin hal boroton iyo hal elektoron)."" 

This directly translates to ""Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost **electrons** (since the smallest units of hydrogen consist of one proton and one electron).""

Keebaa weedhahan soo socda aan si sax ah u qeexin kibirka libaaxyada?,"Jawaabta saxda ah waa **B: Saamiga lab iyo dhadig iskuma dhigmaan.**

Halkan waxaa ku xusan sababta:

*   **Qoraalka ayaa sheegay:** Libaaxyada malxiisadaha waxaa laga dhiga mid ilaa saddex rag qangaadh ah, iyaga la darayo saddex dumar. Tani waxay ka dhigan tahay in tirada labka iyo dheddigga ay isku mid yihiin ama aad ugu dhow tahay, taasoo ka dhigaysa ""saamiga lab iyo dhadig"" mid isku mid ah.

    *   **D:** Qoraalka wuxuu tilmaamayaa in ay yihiin kuwo dilaa ah oo bulsho yaqaana labadaba.

Sidaa darteed, kaliya B ayaa been abuur ah, taasoo ka dhigaysa jawaabta saxda ah."
Keebaa weedhahan soo socda aan si sax ah u qeexin hab-dhaqanka libaaxyada?,"Jawaabta saxda ah waa **D: Dhaqankoodu wuxuu la mid yahay bisadaha kale ee waaweyn.**

Sababta:

Qoraalka ayaa si cad u sheegay in raxan raxan libaaxyadu aysan u dhaqmin sida bisadaha kale ee waaweyn. Waxa uu yiri ""laakiin maaha sida bisadaha kale ee waawayn"".

Halkan waxaa ku qeexaya sababaha jawaabaha kale ay sax yihiin:

*   **A: Waa kuwo bulsho yaqaan ah:** Qoraalka wuxuu sheegay in libaaxyadu ay yihiin ""bisadaha ugu bulsheysan"" oo ay ""raxan raxan isku jufaa yihiin"".
*   **B: Hab-dhaqankoodu wuxuu la mid yahay kan yeeyga:** Qoraalku wuxuu tilmaamayaa in raxan raxan libaaxyadu ay dhaqmaan sida ""tumbulo yey iyo ey ah"".
*   **C: Labka iyo dheddigga labaduba aad bay dilaa ugu yihiin dhanka ugaadhsiga:** Qoraalku wuxuu sheegay in libaaxyadu ay ""aad ugu daran yihiin ugaadhooda""."
Bakaylaha ugaadh caadiya wuxuu u yahay ugaadhsade noocee ah?,"The correct answer is **C: Bisadaha dhexdhexaadka ah**.

The text states: ""Waxa ku hoos jira bisadaha dhexe ee cuna ugaadha dhexe ee kala ah bakayle ilaa deero."" This directly translates to ""It includes medium-sized predators that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from lynx to deer.""  Therefore, a lynx (bakayle) is a medium-sized predator."
Bisadaha yaryar inta badan waxay ugaarsadaan kuwan soo socda kee?,"The correct answer is **A: Dooliga**.

The text states that small predators (including shrews) eat *very small insects* like ants, beetles, aphids, and *dooliga* (lice). The other options – bakayle (porcupine), biciid (giraffe), and deero (gazelle) – are all larger animals that would be hunted by the mid-level predators, not the small ones.

Midkee kuwan soo socda aan si sax ah u qeexin ocelot? ,"Jawaabta saxda ah waa **C: Dareenkooda urta waa daciif**.

Qoraalku wuxuu tilmaamayaa in guduudanayaashu ay leeyihiin aragti habeeneed aad u fiican oo ay adeegsadaan mugdiga, laakiin wax warqad ah kama qorin inay leeyihiin dareen ur oo daciif.  Inta kale ee jawaabaha (A, B, iyo D) waxaa si toos ah looga sheegay qoraalka."
Midkee kuwan soo socda aan loo tixgelin doonin xoogga ugu weyn ee shabeelka?,"Jawaabta saxda ah waa **A: Guuxa**.

Qoraalka ayaa tilmaamaya in shabeelku fiican yahay **dhisidda**, **dabbaalanka**, **bootinta**, iyo **jiidida** (awood shan laab ka badan aadamaha). Waxa uu sidoo kale sheegaa in cida shabeelku aanu ahayn mid la mid ah kan libaaxa, balse uu aad ugu dhaw yahay *kalmado loogu dhawaaqay si cadho leh* - taas oo muujineysa guuxa.

Sidaa darteed, guuxa ayaa ah mid aan loo tixgelin doonin xoogga ugu weyn ee shabeelka, maadaama aan lagu sheegin qoraalka inuu yahay mid xoog leh."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kee baa ah farqiga u dhexeeya shabeel iyo libaax?","The correct answer is **B: Codkooda guuxa (Their roar)**.

The text specifically states: ""Shabeelku kuma eeka cida libaaxa, balse waxay aad ugu dhawdahay kalmado loogu dhawaaqay si cadho leh."" This translates to ""The leopard does not sound like a lion's roar, but it is very close to words spoken angrily.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Awoodooda dabaasha (Their swimming ability):** The text says the leopard *can* swim, but doesn't compare it to a lion.
*   **C: Masaafada booditaankooda (Their jumping distance):** The text mentions leopards can jump far, but doesn’t compare to lions.
*   **D: Xoogooda jiiditaanka (Their pulling strength):** The text mentions their strength, but doesn’t differentiate it from a lion.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, muxuu Robert Hooke sameeyay kahor aqoonyahanada bayolojiga ee kale?","The correct answer is **A: U fiirsashada unugyada dhintay**.

The text states: ""Isaguu ahaa qofkii ugu horeeyay ee arka unugyo dhintay."" (He was the first person to see dead cells.) This directly answers the question.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Isticmaalka mikroskoob si uu arko noolaha** - The text doesn't say he was the first to use a microscope to see living things, only that he looked at cork with one.
*   **C: U fiirsashada afargeesyada yaryar** - The text mentions ""barxadyo yar-yar"", which translates to ""small compartments,"" but it doesn't frame it as a unique achievement.
*   **D: Soo daahfurka unugyada ugu shaqada yar ee noolaha** - The text defines cells but doesn't attribute the discovery of the *basic* unit of life to Hooke.



"
"""Waa maxay asalka ereyga """"unug"""" macnaheedu?""","The correct answer is **B: Qol yar**.

The text states: ""Unug (cell) waxa laga keenay kelmadda Laatiinka ah ee cella taasoo la macno ah qol yar."" This directly translates to ""Cell originates from the Latin word 'cella' which means a small room.""



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, xayawaanka badankoodu waxay awood u leeyihiin inay sameeyaan maxay?","The correct answer is **B: Dhaqaaqaan** (Move).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Inta badan xayawanada waa ay socdaan."" which translates to ""Most animals are able to move."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Duulaan** (Fly) - The text says *some* animals fly, but not that *most* do.
*   **C: Dabaashaan** (Swim) - The text says *some* animals swim, but not that *most* do.
*   **D: Qodaan** (Dig) - The text mentions digging as an example of where animals are found, but doesn’t state it is something most animals *can do*.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa xoolaha qaar ayanan lahayn?","The correct answer is **C: Maskax**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Xayawaanada oo keliya ayaa leh maskaxyo (inkasto dhamaan xayawaanadu ayna wada lahayn tusaale ahaan; xayawaan badeedka,malaha wax maskax ah)."" This means some animals *do not* have brains.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Unugyo** - The text says animals *are made of* many cells.
*   **B: Awooda dheefshiid** - The text says animals eat and *digest* food internally, meaning they have the ability to digest.
*   **D: Awooda cunto** - The text states animals eat.

"Maxaa ka caawiya dhirta nidaamka ee photosynthesis,ka?","The correct answer is **D: Qorax**

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Dhirtu waxay cuntada ka samaysaa qoraxda iyadoo isticmaalaysa habka footosintasiska."" (Plants make food from the sun using the process of photosynthesis). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hoos** - This doesn't relate to photosynthesis.
*   **B: Xoolo** - Animals depend on plants, but don't *help* plants with photosynthesis.
*   **C: Cunto** - Plants *create* food through photosynthesis, they don't need food to do it.



"
Maxay dadku neefsadaan oo ay dhirtu jiidaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Kaarboon ogsaydhka (Carbon dioxide)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dhirtu waxa ay sameyaan oxygen-ka bini'aadamka neefsado, waxa ayna qaatan carbon-dioxide-ka bini aadamka dibada usoo neefsado.""  This translates to ""Plants make the oxygen humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide humans exhale.""

Therefore, humans breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide, which plants then absorb."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, tusaalayaashan soo socda keebaa caqabad ku noqon kara geedi socodka horumarka?","The correct answer is **A: Koox yar oo ku guuldarraysatay horumar ka samayso meel cusub**.

Here's why:

The text describes speciation happening *because* a small group successfully adapts to a different environment. If a small group *fails* to adapt, they won't diverge and become a new species. The core of speciation, as described in the text, is the need to adapt to new challenges and become different competitors. Failure to adapt halts that process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Qayb ka mida hal bulsho oo u guuraya meel cusub** - This is the *starting point* of the speciation process described in the text.
*   **C: Dadweyne hagaajinaya wax ka badalaya la qabsiga deegaan cusub** - This is *part of* the adaptation process that *leads* to speciation.
*   **D: Hal dadwayne ayaa aakhirka sameya laba** - This is the *result* of speciation, not a challenge to it.

Qaybtee ka mid ah habka wareegga dhiigga ayaa dhiigga u keena wadnaha?,"The correct answer is **B: Xididdada dhiigga**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Dhiigu wuxuu kusoo noqdaa wadnaha isagoo usii mara qasabado la dhaho fiinis.""  ""Fiinis"" translates to veins, which are types of blood vessels. Therefore, veins (xididdada dhiigga) are the part of the circulatory system that bring blood *to* the heart.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Halbowlayaasha (Arteries):** The text says arteries carry blood *from* the heart.
*   **C: Xubnaha (Organs):** Organs are part of the system but don't directly return blood to the heart.
*   **D: Aroor (I don't recognize this word in context, and it's irrelevant to the passage).**



"
Waa kuwee tuubooyinka ugu yar-yar habka wareegga dhiigga?,"The correct answer is **A: Xididdada dhiigga**.

The passage states: ""Qasabadaha ugu yaryar waxaa la dhahaa kaabilariis.""  ""Kaabilariis"" translates to capillaries in English, which are the smallest blood vessels.  ""Xididdada dhiigga"" means blood vessels in Somali, and specifically refers to the capillaries in this context.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Halbowlayaasha (Veins):** These are larger vessels that carry blood *to* the heart.
*   **C: Aroor (Arteries):** These are larger vessels that carry blood *from* the heart.
*   **D: Xubnaha (Organs):** Organs are body parts, not blood vessels.



"
Awooda uu cayayaanku u leeyahay in uu baalashiisa dhabarka u laabto waxa ay kordhisa kuwa soo socda midkee?,"The correct answer is **B: meelaha qarsoon**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Tani waxay u suurto galisaa meelo yaryar oo badan taasoo ay iska qarin karaan shimbiraha wax ugaadhsada."" This directly links the ability to fold wings to increased hiding places/spots.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sahayda cuntada** - While flying helps find food, the passage doesn't say folding wings specifically *increases* food availability.
*   **C: Helitaanka saaxiibo** - The passage doesn't mention anything about finding mates.
*   **D: Xawaaraha duulimaadka** - Folding wings doesn't necessarily increase speed; it's more about maneuverability and hiding.



"
Kuwa soo socda keebaa aan lagu xusin qoraalka sida shay ay saamayso awoodda duulista ee cayayaanka?,"The correct answer is **B: Mudada nolosha (Lifespan)**.

Here's why:

*   **The text states the following about the impact of flight on insects:**
    *   Escaping predators easily.
    *   Finding food.
    *   Reproducing efficiently.

*   **Let's look at the options:**
    *   **A: Taran (Predators)** - The text directly mentions escaping from predators.
    *   **C: Ururinta cuntada (Food gathering)** - The text specifically states flight helps in finding food.
    *   **D: Waxtarka (Efficiency)** - The text talks about reproduction being more efficient with flight.
    *   **B: Mudada nolosha (Lifespan)** - The text does *not* mention how flight affects how long insects live.

Therefore, lifespan is the only option not linked to the benefits of flight as described in the passage."
Midkee ka mid ah sifooyinka soo socda ee aan inta badan lala xiriirin daynasoorada?,"The correct answer is **B: Baalal**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that many people don't think of dinosaurs as having wings (because they have wings to fly). It also describes the creatures walking on two legs like a T-Rex, having scaly legs, laying eggs, and alluding to the fact that these creatures are similar to dinosaurs in many ways. Therefore, wings/baalal are the trait *least* associated with the creatures described (and thus, with dinosaurs in the context of the passage)."
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan loo tixgalin sifada ay wadaagaan shimbiraha iyo daynasoorada?,"The correct answer is **C: Awooda duulimaad**.

Here's why:

The text states that many people don't think of dinosaurs because they have wings to fly.  It then points out that in many ways, birds *still* resemble dinosaurs – they have scaled legs, lay eggs, and walk on two legs like a T-Rex.  This implies flight is a feature that separates many dinosaurs from modern birds, not a shared trait.

Let's look at why the other options are wrong:

*   **A: Ukun dhigista (Egg-laying):** The text explicitly states that both birds and dinosaurs lay eggs (""dhalaan ugxaan"").
*   **B: Isticmaalka labada lugood ee dambe si ay u socdaan (Walking on two legs):** The text specifically mentions that both birds and T-Rex walk on their back legs.
*   **D: Cago ciddi leh (Scaled legs):**  The text states birds have ""lugo maraaro iyo ciddiyo leh"" (scaled legs)."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, qaybtee ka mid ah geedka cycad ayaa laga yaabaa in Triceratops ay u badan tahay inay cunaan?","The correct answer is **A: Caleemaha qodxaha leh**.

The text states: ""Taraysatoobyadu waxay afkooda dhuuban ee xooggan u adeegsan kari jireen inay ku diirtaan caleemaha ka hor intanaay cunin jirridda."" This translates to: ""Triceratops could have used their strong, beak-like mouths to focus on the leaves before eating the trunk.""

Therefore, the text specifically mentions they were likely to eat the leaves.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, keebaa kuwan soo socda ay u badan tahay in Triceratops ku cuno? ","The correct answer is **C: Baqbaqaaq da**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Saynisyahano kale ayaa ku dooda in dhirtaas aad u sun badan yihiin markaas aanay suurtogal ahayn in dhaynasooradu cuni jireen, in kasta maanta islooska iyo xaywaano kale sida baqbaqaaqdu (ubadkii dhaynasoorada) ay cuni karaan caleemo iyo miro sun ah.""

This directly implies that *baqbaqaaq* (often translated as lizards, and in this context understood as descendants of dinosaurs) *can* eat plants with poisonous fruits and leaves.  The question asks what Triceratops (a type of dinosaur) would *likely* eat, and baqbaqaaq being able to eat poisonous plants makes them the most plausible answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Xayawaanka caajislowga:** The text doesn't mention this.
*   **B: Geedaha laamaha adag leh:** The text says Taraysatoobyadu way burburin karayeen, but it doesn’t mean they ate them.
*   **D: Geed leh miro sun ah:** The text specifically states that dinosaurs (like Triceratops) likely *couldn't* eat these."
"Sida ku cad qoraalka, ciyaaraha soo socda kee baa loo badinayaa inuu caan ka yahay gobollada waqooyi ee Talyaaniga?","The correct answer is **A: Kubadda Cagta (Football)**.

The text specifically states: ""Ciyaaraha xagaaga ahaa ah kuwa ugu caansan gobolada waqooyiga..."" and football (kubbadda cagta) is listed as one of those summer sports. 

The other options are either not mentioned as being popular in northern Italy or are winter sports (like skiing)."
"Iyadoo lagu salaynayo xogta ku xusan qoraalka, ciyaarahan soo socda keebaa ku guulaystay horyaalka aduunka ee Italy?","The correct answer is **A: Kubadda Cagta** (Football).

Dhacdodee ka dib ayay qaybo ka mid ahi Luxembourg ay noqdeen Biljam?,"The correct answer is **B: Kacaankii Biljamka**.

The text states: ""Qaybaha ku cusub Biljamka ayaa ahaa qayb kamida Luxembourg berigii hore lakiin waxay noqdeen Biljam intii ka danbaysay 1830 maadkii kadib kacdoonkii Biljamka."" This directly links the change in territory to the Belgian Revolution."

*   **C: Kacaankii Biljamka:** Kacaankii Biljamka waxa sababay qaybo ka mid ah Luxembourg inay noqdaan Biljam, laakiin ma saameeyin dhexdhexaadnimada Luxembourg.
*   **D: Noqoshada wadan madax banaan:** Noqoshada wadan madax banaan waa natiijo, oo ma saameeyo dhexdhexaadnimada Luxembourg."
Immisa kilomitir oo laba jibaaran oo ka mid ah bedka guud ee Turkiga ayaa ka tirsan Yurub?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The passage states: ""23,764 square kilometers (9,174 sq mi) are in Europe."" The question asks for the number of square *kilometers*, so 23764 is the correct answer."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, ilaa intee mayl ayuu gaarayaa dhererka Turkiga?","The correct answer is **D: 1000**.

The text states: ""Dhulka Turkigu waxa uu dhererkiisu ka badan yahay 1,600 kilomitir (1,000 mi)...""  It explicitly gives the length in miles as 1,000.



"
Maxay tahay luqadda Laatiinka ah ee magaalada Fatikanka laga isticmaalo?,"The correct answer is **A: Xafladaha diimeed**.

The text states: ""Latinka badiyaa laga isticmaalo xafladaha diiniga ah."" (Latin is often used in religious ceremonies)."
"Magaalada Fatikanka, maxaa luuqada Talyaaniga aanan loo isticmaalin?","The correct answer is **C: Xafladaha diimeed**.

Here's why:

The text states that Latin is *often used* for religious ceremonies in Vatican City, while Italian is used for its laws and official communication. Therefore, Italian is **not** primarily used for religious ceremonies.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwan soo socda kee baa ka faa'iidaysanaya isku dhafka dhawaaqa ee kumbuyuutarrada casriga ah?","The correct answer is **A: Muusiga**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Musikada badana waxaa la lagu duuba iyadoo la isticmalayo qalabka kombuterada ee lagu hagaajiyo laguna daro codka."" This directly translates to ""Much of the music is recorded using computer equipment to improve and add sound.""  This indicates music benefits from the advancements in computer sound technology.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Sawir kartoonka dhaqdhaqaaqa (Animated cartoons)** - While the text mentions cartoons are *made* with computers, it doesn't specifically state they benefit from *sound mixing* technology.
*   **C: Sawiro (Images)** - The text says computers are used to *manage* images, not enhance their sound.
*   **D: Dhismaha (Construction)** - This is irrelevant to the text.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, inta badan guryaha xagee bay ku yaalliin kuwa ay musquluhu falaashka leeyihiin?","The correct answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

The text states: ""Almost every house in the cities of **Harappa and Mohenjo-daro** had toilets connected to sophisticated drainage systems.""  The question asks where houses *most* commonly had toilets with flushing systems, and the text specifically highlights these two cities.
"
Waa kuwee meelaha soo socda ee laga helay hababka bulaacadaha ee horumarsan?,"The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

The passage specifically states: ""Ku dhawaad guri kasta oo ku yaal magaalooyinka **Harappa** iyo Mohenjo-daro wuxu leeyahay musqulo la falaashiyo oo ku sii xiran bullaacado casri ah.""

While Santorini (B) and Masar (C) are also mentioned as having sanitation systems, the passage highlights Harappa as having *advanced flushing toilets connected to sophisticated drainage systems*.  China (D) is not mentioned in the text.



"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda ayaa sababa in uu iskeerku leexdo?,"The correct answer is **A: Qallooca yar oo ku yaal xagga hoose ee saxanka iskeerka**.

The passage states, ""Maadaama gunta safeexaddu xoogaa xoodan tahay, mar hadii safeexaddu dhinac u yara janjeedho, dhinacyada barafka taabanaya sidoo kale way xoodmaan."" This directly refers to a slight imperfection or ""qallooc"" on the bottom of the skate. This imperfection causes the skate to edge, and that edge is what makes the person turn.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Labada geesood ee ku teedsan saxanka iskeerka** - While skates have edges, the passage specifically mentions a *slight* imperfection causing the turn, not the intentional edges themselves.
*   **C: Heerka xirfadda guud ee iskeerka** - Skill level affects *how* someone uses the skates, but not the fundamental mechanism causing the turn.
*   **D: Tayada barafka** - The quality of the ice affects grip, but doesn't directly cause the turning action.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwan soo socda kee baa si sax ah u qeexaya godanka saxanka barafka casriga ah?","The correct answer is **A: Laba af leh**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kabaha loogu talagalay in lagu ciyaaro ciyaaraha barafka waxay leeyahiin **laba af** waxna wuu u dhaxeeya."" This directly describes a key feature of modern snowboard boots.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: qaloocan:** While the sole is described as 'xoogaa xoodan', 'qaloocan' isn't the defining characteristic.
*   **C: Hoos u laaban:** The passage doesn't mention the boots being bent downward.
*   **D: La janjeershay:** The passage mentions the boards *can* tilt, causing the edges to dig in, but the boots themselves aren’t described as intentionally angled/tilted. They're designed to *allow* for this tilting.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, waa maxay habka u oggolaanaya atamka in ay ka takhalusaan tamarta dheeraadka ah ee iftiinka?","The correct answer is **B: Siidaynta fotoonada la qaabeeyay** (Emission of shaped photons).

Here's why:

The text specifically states that atoms get rid of excess energy by *emitting* light in the form of tiny particles called ""photons."" It then refers to the process as ""a system of producing photons"".  The text highlights the release of photons *as* the method of energy disposal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shucaaca (Radiation)** - While the light *is* radiation, the text focuses on the *process* of releasing photons *as* the radiation, not radiation itself.
*   **C: Fotoono (Photons)** - Photons are *what* is released, not the *how* of the release.
*   **D: Kor u qaadida soo daynta shucaaca (Increasing radiation emission)** - This isn't mentioned in the text. The text describes the *mechanism* (photon emission), not increasing an overall emission rate.



"
Maxaa sababa in atamka uu soo daayo fotoono?,"The correct answer is **A: Sii daynta tamarta xad dhaafka ah**.

Here's why:

The passage states that atoms need to ""get rid of the extra energy they gained from the light"" to return to their original energy level. They do this by emitting photons. This implies the release of *excess* energy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kor u kicida ay sababto iftiinka dhalaalaya:** The passage describes what happens *after* an atom gains energy, not the initial excitation.
* **C: Heerarka tamarta aan degganayn:** While atoms can be in excited states (non-stable energy levels), the passage focuses on the process of *returning* to a stable state and releasing energy as photons.
* **D: Falcelin xun oo shucaac ah:** The passage describes a natural process of energy release, not a harmful reaction.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa aakhirka sababi doona in nalka iftiinka uu joojiyo shaqada?","The correct answer is **C: Fiilada gudaha laambada ayaa gubanaysa**.

The passage states: ""Kadib boqolaal saacadood oo shaqo ah fiilada nalka ugu dambayn way gubataa, nalkana ma sii shaqeeyo."" This directly indicates that the burning out of the filament is what causes the lightbulb to stop working.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Laambada nalka oo aan si saxan loo damin** - The text discusses *why* you need to turn off the power before changing the bulb, not that improper turning off causes the bulb to fail.
*   **B: Saldhigga birta laambada oo kaliya qayb ahaan ku jirta godka** - This is mentioned as a safety hazard, but not as the reason the bulb stops working.
*   **D: Qulqulka korontada ee godka ayaa hoos u dhacaya** - The text doesn’t say the electricity flow decreases, it says that electricity remaining in the socket is a shock hazard."
Kuwa soo socda keebaa khatar noqon kara in la taabto marka la bedelayo nalka?,"The correct answer is **D: Fiilada**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically warns that the metal part of the socket (which the filament is inside of and connected to) can deliver a dangerous electric shock if touched *while still plugged in*.  The filament (fiilada) is part of that socket system and is the component that burned out.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Daaradamiyaha (Switch)** - The passage says to turn the switch off *before* changing the bulb, meaning the switch itself isn't the danger, but failing to use it is.
*   **B: Saldhigga laambada (Lamp base)** - The passage doesn't mention the lamp base as a source of danger.
*   **C: Fiilada (The Cord)** - While a damaged cord can be dangerous, the passage focuses on the danger within the socket itself."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa dhacaya marka xudunta la kala qaybiyo?","The correct answer is **B: Tamar ayaa la sii daayaa** (Energy is released).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Bu’da ayaa kala qaybsamaysa oo sii daynaysa waxooga tamar ah."" which translates to ""The nucleus splits and releases some energy.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Borotoono ayaa la helaa** (Protons are obtained) - While protons are *part* of the nucleus, the text doesn't say they are obtained *when* it splits.
*   **C: Atomyadu waxay noqdaan kuwo aan degganayn** (Atoms become unstable) - The text states *some* atoms aren't stable in their growth, but doesn’t say that splitting causes instability.
*   **D: Neutrons ayaa luma** (Neutrons disappear) - The text does not mention neutrons disappearing.



"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo ka tarjumaya wicitaanada masaafo dheer ee dhulka,"Jawaabta saxda ah waa **B: dayax-gacmeedyada**.

Sababta: qoraalku si cad u sheegayaa in dayax-gacmeedyada (satellites) la isticmaalo wicitaanada qof kumanaan mayl kuu jira.  Waxaa lagu sheegay in wicitaanku maro satellite ka dibna dib loo soo dirayo. Teleskoobka waxaa loo isticmaalaa aragga, ma ahan wicitaannada. Iftiinka iyo gantaallada ma ahan kuwo wicitaannada masaafo dheer ka tarjuma.
"
Kuwan kee baa loo isticmaalaa in lagu dajiyo teleskoobka bannaanka fog?,"The correct answer is **B: Gantaallo**.

Here's why:

The text states that a ""gataal cabirkiisu yahay 100 fiit"" (a 100-foot gate) is needed to get the satellite or telescope up.  This refers to a rocket – essentially a launching vehicle, which is commonly called a gantaal (missile/rocket) in Somali.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: fallaaraha iftiinka (light gates):** This doesn't make sense in the context of launching a telescope into space.
*   **C: Jawiga guud ee dhulka (Earth's general atmosphere):** The text says the atmosphere *interferes* with telescopes, it doesn't help launch them.
*   **D: Dayax-gacmeedyada dhulka ka sarreeya 100 cagood (Satellites above 100 feet):** Satellites are what you *put* on the rocket, not what you use to launch something.



"
Maxaa loo baahan yahay in la xusuusnaado oo ku saabsan dhacdo xilliyeedka si loo daba galo socodka waqtiga?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku celcelinta (Repetition)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Waxaad waqtiga socdo ku qiyaasi kartaa indha indhaynta wax soo noqnoqdo. Wax soo noqnoqdo ayaa ah wax si joogto ah dhaco oo hadana dhaco.""  This directly links the measurement of time's passage to the observation of repetitive events. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Muddada (Duration):** While duration is *related* to time, the text doesn't say it's what we need to *observe* to track time's flow.
*   **C: Saamayn (Impact):**  The text mentions time *has* an impact, but not that impact is how we measure it.
*   **D: Adag (Difficult):** The text notes time is hard to understand, but doesn't suggest it's key to tracking its passage.



"
"Sida ku xusun qoraalka, dhinacee ka mid ah dhacdada ee isticmaala wakhti si loo barbardhigo?","The correct answer is **A: Dhererka**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Waqtigu isna sidoo kale waa sida aynu **muddaynta (dhererka)** dhacdooyinka isu barbar dhigno."" This directly translates to ""Time is also how we compare the **duration (length)** of events."" 

The passage explains that we perceive and measure time by comparing how long things last. The other options don't align with this explanation:

*   **Ku celcelinta (Repetition):** While repetition *can* help us perceive time, the text doesn't say we use it to *compare* events.
*   **Khibrada (Experience):** Experience is related to time, but isn't what we use to measure it.
*   **Saamayn (Impact):** Impact is a result of events in time, not a way to measure time itself.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwan soo socda kee baa loo arkaa mid caadi u ah dhaxalka carshiga?","Answer: **B: Ka tagida jaamacada si ugu biiro ciidamada**

**Explanation:**

The text states: ""Traditionally, heirs to the throne would go straight into the military after finishing school."" This means joining the military after school is the *traditional* or *normal* path for someone in line for the throne. 

The text highlights that Charles *deviated* from this tradition by going to university. The other options (getting a 2:2, studying history, attending university) are all things Charles did that were *not* traditional for a royal heir."
"Iyada oo lagu salaynayo xogta lagu xusay mariska, Charles wuxuu ahaa kii ugu horreeyay ee sameeyo maxay?","The correct answer is **C: Qaadashada shahaado digrii ah**.

The passage states: ""Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to be awarded a degree."" This directly answers the question of what Charles was the first to do.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku biiray ciidanka intuusan dhamayn jaamcada** - The passage states the tradition was *to* join the military *after* school, but Charles went to university first.
*   **B: Bartay cilmiga Arkiyoloji** - He studied Anthropology and History, not Archeology.
*   **D: Ka qaybgal Kuleejka Trinity** - While he *did* attend Trinity College, that wasn't what he was the first in his family to do – it was getting a degree."
Dalkee ayay ka yimaaddeen maraakiibta Trygvasson?,"The correct answer is **D: Noorwiij**.

The text explicitly states: ""Olaf Trygvasson, oo ahaa Noorwiijiyaan doonayay inuu waddankiisa dib uga soo qabsado Dhaanishka."" (Olaf Trygvasson, who was Norwegian wanted to regain his country from the Danes.)

Therefore, he came from Norway."
"Taariikhda waqti intee le,eg bay Jarmalku ku sameeyeen Istooniyanka saameyn dhaqameed xooggan?","The correct answer is **A: Qiyaastii 200 oo sano ka hor**.

Here's why:

The text states the influence was in the ""15th century"" (Qarniga 15aad).  Today is the 21st century.  21 - 15 = 6 centuries. However, the influence started *in* the 15th century and led to the beginnings of literacy, implying a development period *within* that century and potentially slightly beyond. Considering the options, 200 years (roughly aligning with the latter half of the 15th century into the 16th) is the closest and most reasonable estimate based on the text's information. The other options represent far longer time periods than what the text suggests.



"
Luqada Istooniyaanka waxaa saameeyay maxay?,"The correct answer is **B: Xarfaha Jarmalka**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the Estonian language was influenced by German culture and that the creation of the Estonian written language *was based on* the German alphabet and *included* a German letter (""O/o""). While the monks (C) initiated the process and the intent was to bring people closer to God (D), the direct influence was the German alphabet itself. The addition of the Õ/õ (A) is a *result* of the German influence, not the influence itself.

Therefore, **B** is the most accurate and direct answer to the question.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, tirada dadka ku hadla afka Hindiga ayaa isbedbedelaya iyadoo lagu salaynayo qodobkee?","The correct answer is **A: Haddii lahjadaha Hindiga la midka ah la tiriyo**.

The text explicitly states: ""Tirada dadka luuqadda u dhashay way kala duwan tahay iyadoo ay ku xiran in la tiriyo lahjadaha aadka ugu dhow ama in kale."" This means the number of Hindi speakers varies depending on whether or not closely related dialects are included in the count.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Haddii dadka Urduuga ku hadla la tirinayo:** The text states Hindi and Urdu are similar but distinct in writing, and speakers can understand each other, but doesn't say the *number* of Hindi speakers changes based on counting Urdu speakers.
* **C: Haddii dadka fahmi kara luuqada la tirinayo:** While the text mentions 800 million *understand* Hindi, the varying number (340-500 million) refers to native speakers.
* **D: Haddii dadka afka akhrin kara la tirinayo:** The text doesn't mention anything about reading ability.

The passage specifically states: ""Afka Hindiga iyo Urduga ayaa ereyadooda aad isugu dhaw laakin ku kala duwan qoraalka"" (Hindi and Urdu have very similar words but differ in writing).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Inta badan waxaa jira kala go'a u dhexeeya ku hadlayaasha labada luqadood** (There is often a communication barrier between speakers of the two languages) - The passage says they *can* understand each other in everyday conversation.
*   **C: Waxay ka mid yihiin ereyada iyo qoraalka labadaba** (They differ in both words and writing) - The passage states the *words* are very similar.
*   **D: Way ku kala duwan yihiin ereyada** (They differ in words) - The passage states the *words* are very similar."

Here's why:

* The text states Hangeul was created in 1444, during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450). This means it was created *during* his reign, not at the very beginning of it.
* **B** is correct: The text states the original name was Hunmin Jeongeum.
* **C** is correct: The text states King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty and created it.
* **D** is correct: The text explicitly says it was ""systematically designed"".

Therefore, only option A is factually incorrect based on the provided text."
Alifbeetada Hunmin Jeongeum aakhirkii noocee ayaa loo badalay?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

The text states that the original name for the alphabet was *Hunmin Jeongeum*, and it then says ""Markii hore alifbeetada Hangeul waxa uu baxshay Hunmin Jeongeum..."" which translates to ""Originally the alphabet Hangeul came from Hunmin Jeongeum."" This indicates that Hunmin Jeongeum was the *previous* name, and it became known as Hangeul.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, luqadahee ayaa Sanskrit ay saamaysay?","The correct answer is **D: Luuqadaha Hindiya**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Sanskrit waa luuqad adag oo qani ah, taasoo luuqada badan oo casri oo Hindiya laga isticmaalo ka yimaadeen, sida Laatiinku u yahay halka luuqadaha Reer Yurub ka yimaadeen sida Faransiiska iyo Isbaanishka."" This directly indicates that modern Indian languages originated from Sanskrit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Luuqadaha Laatiinka:** The text compares Sanskrit *to* Latin, but doesn't say Sanskrit influenced Latin.
*   **B: Luuqadaha Yurub:**  The text says Sanskrit is *like* Latin in its relationship to European languages, but doesn't claim direct influence on them.
*   **C: Luuqadihii qadiimiga ahaa:** While Sanskrit is ancient, the text focuses on its influence on *Indian* languages.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, adeegsiga luuqada Sanskrit waa uu is dhimay maxaa sababay?","The correct answer is **D: Kala sareynta (Hierarchy)**.

The text states: ""Sanskrit wuu baaba'ay darajo-saraysiinta awgeed."" This directly translates to ""Sanskrit disappeared due to hierarchy/elevation,"" meaning that it lost prominence as other, more 'elevated' forms of language emerged.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kakanaanta (Difficulty):** While the text mentions Sanskrit is a ""difficult"" language, it doesn't state this caused its decline.
*   **B: Qaxootiga Aryan (Aryan migration):** The text mentions the theory of Aryan migration as a belief about Sanskrit's *origin*, not its decline.
*   **C: Luuqadaha Laatiinka (Latin languages):** The text compares Sanskrit *to* Latin, not says Latin languages caused its decline.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwan soo socda kee ayaa bayaan saxa oo ku saabsan cufjiidadka Io?","The correct answer is **A: Cufjiidadka dhulku wuxuu kugu soo jiidan doonaa wax ka yar cufjiidadka Io**.

Here's why:

The text states that you would weigh *less* on Io (36 pounds vs. 200 pounds on Earth). This directly implies Io has lower gravity than Earth. If Earth's gravity pulls you less, that means Io's gravity pulls you even less. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Cuf-jiidadka Io ayaa in ka badan soo jiidaya, waana sababta aad u miisaan yaraan lahayd** -  This is incorrect because if Io had stronger gravity, you would weigh *more*, not less.
* **C: Cuf-jiidadka Io ayaa in ka badan soo jiidaya, taas oo ah sababta aad u miisaan badan lahayd** - Again, stronger gravity means more weight.
* **D: Cufjiidadka dhulku wuxuu kugu soo jiidan lahaa wax ka badan cufjiidadka Io** - The text shows the opposite is true. Io's gravity is weaker.

"Marka loo eego qoraalka, keebaa weedhahan soo socda si sax ah u qeexaya lakabka sare ee Dayaxa?","The correct answer is **B: qoloftu way ka khafiifsan tahay dhulalka sare hoosteeda**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Waxay ka dhuuban tahay maria-ga hoostiisa waxay na ka balaaran tahay dhulka sare.""  This translates to ""It is thinner beneath the maria and thicker than the highlands.""  ""Thinner"" means less dense/khafiifsan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dhinaca dhow ayaa leh qolof ka sii dhumuc weyn** - The text says the near side's crust is *thinner* (dhuuban), not thicker (dhumuc weyn).
* **C: Waxaa laga yaabaa inay ku yar tahay barxadyada maria dhinaca fog** - The text discusses thickness variations generally, not specifically about maria on the far side.
* **D: Waxaa laga yaabaa in ay ku yar tahay barxadyada maria dhulalka sare hoosteeda** - While the text does mention the crust is thinner under maria, this option specifically ties it to highlands which isn’t the primary point.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, halkee ayaa qolofta dayaxa ugu dhumuc badan tahay?","The correct answer is **A: Dhinaca dhow**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dhumucda qolafta ee dhanka dhow waa ku dhawaad 70 km dhanka durugsana waa 100 km."" This directly translates to ""The thickness of the crust on the near side is about 70 km, on the far side it is 100 km.""  Therefore, the crust is thickest on the near side (dhanka dhow).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Halka ay jiraan barxadyada maria oo badan** - While the text mentions maria, it doesn't say the crust is thickest *where* maria are located. It says the crust is *under* the maria.
*   **C: dhulalka sare hoosteeda** - The text states the crust is *wider* under the highlands, but doesn't say it's *thickest* there.
*   **D: Barxadlayda maria hoosteeda** - Similar to B, the text mentions the crust is *under* maria, not that it's thickest there.

The text specifically states: ""dad qaarkooda ayaa isweydiiyo waxa dibadda ka jiro kuwa na waxay aaminsan yihiin in noolaha shisheeye ama noola kale ku nool yihiin meel kale."" This translates to ""some people wonder what is out there and they believe that alien life exists elsewhere.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dadku waxa ay u safreen xiddigo kale** (People have traveled to other stars) - The text says people *dream* of traveling to other stars, but doesn't state it has happened.
*   **B: Dadku ma awoodaan inay sahamiyaan adduunyo kale** (People cannot explore other worlds) - The text implies exploration is a future possibility, not a current impossibility.
*   **D: In ka yar tirilyoono mayl ayaa u dhexeeya xiddigaha** (Less than trillions of miles separate the stars) - The text states the opposite - that stars are *thousands of billions of miles* apart."

Kuwa soo socda kee buu arkay Galileo Galilei 1610kii?,"The correct answer is **B: Marxaladaha meeraha Venus**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ilaa sadax kuno sano kadib, 1610, xidag barte Galileo Galilei ayaa waxa uu ku ogaaday telescope in Venus uu leeyahay wajiyo kala duwan, sida bisha oo kale."" This directly translates to Galileo Galilei discovered the phases of Venus in 1610.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dhinac ka mid ah Dayaxa oo ku wajahan Qorraxda** - This is mentioned as an *explanation* for the phases, not what Galileo observed.
*   **C: Wareega meeraha ee uu ku wareegayo agagaarka Qorraxda** - Galileo's observations *supported* this idea (Copernicus's theory), but he didn't directly see the orbit itself.
*   **D: Gudbitaanka meeraha Venus** - Jeremiah Horrocks saw the transit of Venus, not Galileo.

Here's why:

The passage states the Amazon is the *second* longest river in the world. It does *not* say it is the longest. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waa webiga labaad ee ugu dheer** - This is stated in the passage.
*   **B: Waa wabiga ugu wayn** - The passage states it is the second largest, not the largest.
*   **D: Waa wabiga ugu balaca wayn** - The passage *does* state it is the widest river, so this is a true statement about the Amazon. However, the question is asking what attribute is *not* attributed to the Amazon, and the Amazon *is* the widest river.

Waa kuwee laynka shaqo ee lagu sheegay qoraalka ee shaqaaleeya tirada ugu yar ee reer Venezuela?,"The correct answer is **A: Beeraha**.

Here's why:

* **Beeraha:** The text states ""shantiiba meel na waxay ka shaqeeyaan beeraha,"" meaning only 1 out of every 5 employed Venezuelans work in agriculture. This is the smallest proportion.
* **Warshadaha:** ""Afartiiba hal ayaa ka shaqeeyaa warshadaha,"" meaning 1 out of 4 employed Venezuelans work in manufacturing.
* **Khidmad:** ""Saddexdi muwaddin oo Venezuela oo shaqayso labo ayaa ka shaqayso qaybta adeega,"" meaning 2 out of 3 employed Venezuelans work in services.
* **Shidaalka:** While important, only 1% of Venezuelans work in the oil industry.

Therefore, **beeraha** employs the smallest number of Venezuelans based on the given ratios."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, waa kuwee waaxaha soo socda ee shaqaaleeya tirada ugu badan ee reer Venezuela?","The correct answer is **A: Khidmad (Service)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Saddexdi muwaddin oo Venezuela oo shaqayso labo ayaa ka shaqayso qaybta adeega..."" This means 2 out of every 3 employed Venezuelans work in the service sector, which is the highest proportion mentioned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Beeraha (Agriculture):** ""Shantiiba meel na waxay ka shaqeeyaan beeraha"" - This represents a smaller proportion (1 out of 5).
*   **C: Warshadaha (Industry):** ""Afartiiba hal ayaa ka shaqeeyaa warshadaha"" - This represents an even smaller proportion (1 out of 4).
*   **D: Shidaalka (Oil):** ""xitaa iskasto boqoqlkiiba hal yahay ay shirkada ka shaqayso"" - This is the smallest proportion (1 out of 100)."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxay isku-dhafku u oggolaanaysa xiddigaha in ay sameeyaan?","The correct answer is **C: Bixinta iftiin iyo kulayl**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Samaysanka walxo ka culus (Making heavier elements)** - While the text mentions fusion *creates* heavier elements, it doesn't say that's *why* stars produce light and heat.
*   **B: Dhisida haykal isku dhafeed (Building a cohesive structure)** - The text doesn't discuss the structure of stars.
*   **D: Abuuritanka atam hydrogen ah (Creating hydrogen atoms)** - The text states hydrogen atoms *fuse*, not are created.



"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda ayaa abuuri kara haykal isku dhafeed ?,"The correct answer is **B: Xidigaha (Stars)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that stars *create* light and heat because of the energy released when hydrogen atoms *fuse* into heavier atoms. This fusion process *creates* a new structure (the heavier atom) from smaller components.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hydrogen:** Hydrogen is the *fuel* for the process, not the thing being created.
*   **C: Atomyada (Atoms):** Atoms are the building blocks, but they are not formed through the process described in the passage; they *combine* to form heavier atoms.
*   **D: Tamarta (Energy):** Energy is *released* by the process, but it isn't a physical structure that is created.



"
Waa maxay samaysanka kiimiko ee biyaha?,"The correct answer is **D: Labo atam oo hydrogen ah iyo hal atam oo oksijiinta ah**.

The text states: ""Curiyaha biyuhu wuxu ka kooban yahay laba atom oo haydarajiin ah iy mid ogsajiin ah."" This translates to ""The water molecule consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom."""
"Marka ay qaabka biyuhu baddelmaan, maxaa siduu ahaa sii ahaadaa?","The correct answer is **A: Qaab-dhismeedka molecular**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Waxay leedahay isla qaab dhismeedka haday tahay gas, dareere ama shey adag."" (It has the same molecular structure whether it's gas, liquid, or solid.)  This means the molecular structure remains constant even as the physical state changes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Cufnaanta:** The passage states that liquids are denser, so density changes.
*   **C: Xaalada jireed:** The *xaalada jireed* (physical state) is precisely what *changes* (gas, liquid, solid).
*   **D: Nitrojiin dareeraha ah:** This is unrelated to the example of water discussed in the passage.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwan soo socda kee baan ahayn arrinka ku saabsan saddex iyo toban ka gobol markii ay isku dayeen inay soo rogaan sharciyo cayiman?","The correct answer is **A: Kormeero culus oo ka imaanaya maamulada gobolka**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the *problem* was a lack of enforcement.** The federal government struggled to get states to comply with laws because it couldn't enforce them effectively.  This implies a *lack* of strong oversight *from* the federal government, not *of* the states.
* **B: Awood la'aan ka dhex jirta Kongareeska:** The text explicitly states Congress lacked the power to tax and enforce laws.
* **C: Wax-ka-beddelka u baahan oggolaanshaha wadajirka ah:** The passage explains that amendments required unanimous consent from states, making change very difficult.
* **D: Fulin qaran oo aan jirin:** The text indicates there was no effective national government capable of action.

Therefore, heavy oversight *from* state governments wasn't the problem; the lack of oversight *by* the federal government was the core issue."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, weedhee baa si sax ah uga tarjumaysa xaaladdii dawladdii dhexe ee dagaalkii Kacaanka?","The correct answer is **C: Wakiilada gobolka waxaa ka maqnaa joogitaan muuqda.**

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states:** ""...dadka matalaayay oo mar badan iska maqnaayeen..."" which translates directly to ""representatives were often absent."" This describes a major problem with the central government's function.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Canshuuraha waxaa meelmariyay Congress ka iyo maamulka gobolka:** The passage states Congress *lacked the power* to effectively collect taxes. It did not say they were jointly implementing them.
*   **B: Wax ka beddelka qodobbada waxay ku tiirsanaayeen awoodda Congresska:** The passage indicates amendments required unanimous consent from states, meaning Congress didn't have the sole power to change things.
*   **D: Dawladdii dhexe waxay ka koobnayd laba qaybood oo waaweyn:** The passage doesn't describe a clear two-part structure, but rather a weak central government struggling to control independent states.



"
Sidee loo qoray erayada ku yaal dhabarka dambe ee ku dhawaaqista madax-bannaanida?,"The correct answer is **C: Kor iyo hoos**.

The text states: ""Qoraalku waxa uu ka muuqda gunta dukumeentiga, waana maqluub."" This directly translates to ""The writing appears at the bottom of the document, and is upside down.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Far waawayn** - The text doesn't mention the size of the font.
*   **B: Si sir ah** - While the writing's purpose wasn't widely known, the text doesn't say it was written secretly.
*   **D: Far yar-yar** - Again, the text doesn't mention the size of the font."
Singapore waxa lagu yaqanaa kuwan soo socda midkee?,"Jawabtu waa **A: Magaalada cagaarka**.

Sababta: Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa in khibradda Singapore Botanic Gardens ay gacan ka geysatay in jasiiradda loo beddelo ""Magacalo Janno kuleyl ah"", taas oo tilmaameysaa in Singapore lagu yaqaan cagaarkeeda iyo quruxdeeda dabiiciga ah."
Maxay tahay Vanda Marwo Joaquim?,"The correct answer is **B: Ubax**.

The text states that Vanda Miss Joaquim is ""ubax orchid hybrid"" and was chosen to be the national flower. Therefore, it is a flower."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxay tahay tayada Ahraamta Giza aysan u badnayn in ay la yaabaan Boqortooyada Cusub ee Masaarida?","The correct answer is **A: Cimrigooda (Their age)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Old Kingdom Egyptians *were* amazed by the still-standing structures of those who came before them, structures that had lasted over a thousand years. This implies that the New Kingdom Egyptians were simply encountering structures that were already very old and well-established in their time.  The text doesn't say they were amazed by the size, materials, or design, only that the pyramids were *always* remarkable in those respects. The surprise factor regarding their longevity had already passed by the New Kingdom.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dhagaxa la isticmaalay (The stone used):** The passage doesn't indicate the New Kingdom Egyptians were unimpressed by the stone.
*   **C: Xajmigooda (Their size):** The passage explicitly says the pyramids were never surpassed in size.
*   **D: Qaab dhismeedkooda (Their design):** The passage states the pyramids were remarkable in their architectural prowess.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, halkee bay kasoo socdaalaan xoolaha daaqa iyagoo soo roob raacaya?","The correct answer is **B: Buuraha gaagaaban ee waqooyi**.

The text states: ""ku dhawaad 1.5 milyan ee xayawaanka dhirta cuno ayaa u safro bannaanada koonfurta, iyagoo goynaayo Wabiga Mara, oo ka soo goynaayo buuraha waqooyi iyagoo soo raacayo roobka."" This clearly indicates the animals come from the northern highlands following the rain."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, aaggee bay xoolaha daaqa ka baxaan waqti ku dhow Abriil?","The correct answer is **A: Gobolka Serengeti**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...waxaa usoo laabneysa waqooyiga adigo maryaa galbeed, mar kaleeto waxaad ka gudbeysa wabiga Mara kadib xili roobadka Abriil meelahas."" This means the animals cross the Mara River *to return* to the Serengeti region around April.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Banaanka koonfureed:** They *leave* the southern plains, not return to them in April.
*   **C: Wabiga Mara:** The Mara River is a location they cross, not a destination they return to.
*   **D: the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya:** While part of the Serengeti ecosystem, the text says they are moving *from* these areas northward towards the Serengeti.



"
Hawlgalka Sealion wuxuu ahaa duullaan lagu qaaday waddankee?,"The correct answer is **B: Ingiriiska**.

The text states: ""Markii dagaalkii Faransiisku dhamaaday, ayuu Jarmalku bilaabay inuu isu diyaariyo inuu weeraro **jasiiradda Ingiriiska**. Jarmalku weerarku wuxu kood ahaan ugu baxshay """" Hawlgalka Sealion"""".""

This clearly indicates that Operation Sealion was planned as an attack on the island of Great Britain (Ingiriiska)."
Muxuu Jarmalku ku tilmaamay weerarkii Britain?,"The correct answer is **B: Howgalkii sealion**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Jarmalku weerarku wuxu kood ahaan ugu baxshay """" Hawlgalka Sealion""""."" (German attack was code-named ""Operation Sealion"")."
Maxaa aan lagu xusin tallaabada lagama maarmaanka ah ee qorshaha Talyaanigu ku doonayo inuu ku qabsado dalalka Afrika?,"The correct answer is **C: Asaasida xarun laga diro ciidamada**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Si ay waddamadaas u qabsadaan, waxay u baahanayeen meelo ay ciidamada ka soo kiciyaan, si ciidamadu u badmaaxi karaan badda Midhatareeniyanka oo u weerari karaan Afrika."" This directly indicates that establishing bases to launch troops from was a crucial step in their plan to conquer African nations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ka takhalusidda maraakiibta Masar dhexdeeda** - The text mentions disrupting Egyptian ships, but not eliminating them as a vital step in the overall plan.
*   **B: Dhisidda maraakiib dheeraad ah** - While they built some new ships, the text says their navy was weak and doesn't highlight further shipbuilding as critical to the Africa plan.
*   **D: Burburinta saldhigyadii Ingiriiska** - The text mentions needing to bypass British bases, not destroy them. This is a tactic, but not the core foundational step.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa loo tixgeliyey inay ahayd ujeedada koowaad ee Talyaanigu dagaalka ka lahaa?","The correct answer is **A: Qabashada wadamada Afrika**.

The text states: ""Yoolasha waawayn ee Talyaanigu waxay ahaayeen waddamada Afrika. Si ay waddamadaas u qabsadaan, waxay u baahanayeen meelo ay ciidamada ka soo kiciyaan..."" This directly indicates that conquering African nations was the primary goal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dhisida ciidamo xoog leh iyo kuwo badeed ba:** The text actually says their army and navy were *weak*. They only built a few new ships right before the war.
* **C: Ka takhalusida maraakiibta Masaarida:** The text mentions needing to bypass Egyptian ships, but not destroying them as a primary goal.
* **D: Samaynta saldhigyada Ingiriiska:** They needed to *avoid* British bases, not build them.



"
Yaa xiriir saaxiibtinimo la sameeyay soo duulayaasha?,"The correct answer is **B: Faransiiska Vichy**.

The text specifically states that ""Vichy France"" made a peace agreement with Germany in 1940 and collaborated with them instead of fighting the invaders. This demonstrates a friendly relationship.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jarmalka** - While Germany was involved in the agreement, the question asks *who* made the friendly connection.
*   **C: Maraykanka** - The text states the US *fought* to liberate Southern France, not collaborate.
*   **D: Faransiiska Xorta ah** - The text shows they were fighting *against* the occupiers.



"
Waa kuwee Xulafadii ka qayb qaatay Hawlgalkii Dragoon?,"The correct answer is **A: Maraykanka iyo Faransiiska Xorta ah**.

The passage specifically states: ""labo isbuuc gudahooda oo keli ciidamada Maraykanka iyo Faransiiska Xorta ayaa xoreeyey koonfurta Faransiiska"". This directly identifies these two forces as participants in Operation Dragoon (Hawlgalka Fardaha)."
Horumarka teknooloojiyada noocee ayaa keenay in maraakiibta quusta ay bilaabaan inay ku safraan biyaha hoostooda?,"The correct answer is **D: Raadaarka**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""sida uu raaderku uu uso baxay una noqday mid leysku haleyn karo, gudis yada waxa ay ku qasbanaadeyn in ay biyaha hoostoda jeexan si ay uuga fogaadan in la arko.""  This directly explains that the development of radar forced submarines to travel underwater to avoid detection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Doomaha-U** - U-boats were *types* of submarines, but they didn't *cause* the shift to underwater travel.
*   **B: Aaga toogashada** - Limited firing range was a characteristic of early submarines, not a reason for them to submerge.
*   **C: Badmareen** - This isn't mentioned in the passage and isn't related to the reason for underwater travel."
"Markii ugu horeysay ee la isticmaalay, dhinacee ayay maraakiibta quusta aad uga xaddidnaayeen?","The correct answer is **C: Toogashada**.

The passage states: ""Bilawgi dagaalka waxa ay inta badan ku safri jireen bada dusheeda, laakin sida uu raaderku uu uso baxay una noqday mid leysku haleyn karo, gudis yada waxa ay ku qasbanaadeyn in ay biyaha hoostoda jeexan si ay uuga fogaadan in la arko. Berigaas aad bay u gaabin jireen **tiirada toogashadooduna way xaddidnayd**.""

This directly refers to the limitations of their firing range/accuracy (toogashada) when they were first used."
"Sida ku cad qoraalka, yaa jabiyay heshiis? ","The correct answer is **D: Soofiyetka**.

Here's why:

The text states that the Soviet Union (Midow Sofiyeetka) entered Poland, disregarding treaties like the Riga Peace Treaty and the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. This clearly indicates they broke the agreements.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Booliska (Police)** - The text doesn't mention police breaking treaties.
*   **B: Roomaanka (Romanians)** - While the text mentions Romania as a potential regrouping point, it doesn't say they broke any treaties.
*   **C: Yukreeniyiinta (Ukrainians)** - The text states Soviet forces entered Ukrainian territory (as part of the invasion), but doesn't state Ukrainians broke treaties."
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aysan fulin Ciidanka Cas?,"Jawabta saxda ah waa **C: Dib u habayn ku saabsan buundada**.

Qormada ayaa sheegeysa in Ciidanka Cas ay galeen gobolada bari ee Poland, jebiyeen heshiisyo, iyo abuureen jabhado Yukreeniyaan ah. Waxa ay qormadu sheegtayna ma ahan in ay dib u habeeyeen buundooyinka."
Maxaa ku dhacay Injineerkii Guud ee Ciidanka Tobanaad ee Talyaaniga?,"The correct answer is **C: Waxa gacanta ku dhigay Ingiriis**.

The text states: ""Weerar gaadmo ah oo ka dhacay bariga Bardia, Ingiriiska waxay ku qabsadeen Madaxa Injineerada Ciidanka Tobnaad ee Talyaaniga, Jeneraal Lastucci."" This means General Lastucci was captured by the British.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waxaa lagu qabtay Fort Capuzzo:** This refers to the 11th Hussars capturing Fort Capuzzo, not General Lastucci.
*   **B: Waxaa lagu dilay Tobruk:** This refers to Marshal Balbo, not General Lastucci.
*   **D: Waxaa lagu dilay rasaas saaxiibtinimo:** This also refers to Marshal Balbo, not General Lastucci."
Xagee baa lagu dilay Italo Balbo?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk**.

The text specifically states: ""Maarshaal Italo Balbo, oo ahaa Gudooymiyihii Guud ee Liibiya iyo dhaxal-sugihii Mussolin, waxa dilay xabbad saaxiibtiinimo mar uu ku soo degayay **Tobruk**.""
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, midkee farsamooyinka soo socda ayaa ah qayb muhiim ah oo ka mid ah fikirka yogada Tibetan?","The correct answer is **B: Ku celcelinta odhaah da mantras**.

Here's why:

The text states that Kundalini Yoga in Tibetan Buddhism involves ""... qaab istaaga, jimicsiga neefsashada, **ereyo lagu celceliyo**, iyo waxyaabo la sawirto.""  ""Ereyo lagu celceliyo"" translates to reciting mantras. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku celcelinta jimicsiga neefsiga** - While breath exercises are *part* of Kundalini Yoga, the text specifically highlights reciting words, not just the breathing exercises themselves.
*   **C: Sawirashada khiyaliga ah ee ilaahyada** - Visualization is mentioned as *one* component, but it's not the primary technique emphasized alongside breathing and recitation.
*   **D: Barashada qaababka yogada** - The text doesn't mention learning yoga postures specifically; it focuses on Kundalini Yoga's unique methods."
"""Sida ku xusan qoraalka, sidee samaynta chakras loo hawlgeliyay inta lagu jiro """"xarunta"""" yogada ee Tibetan?""","The correct answer is **A: Iyada oo loo marayo qaababka yogada ee kala duwan**.

Here's why:

The text states that Kundalini Yoga is part of Tibetan Buddhism, and that it involves activating the Kundalini energy through ""postures, breathing exercises, recited words, and visualizations.""  This means different yoga practices (postures, breathing, etc.) are used to work with the energy centers, which aligns with the concept of activating chakras.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Iyadoo la sawiranayo ilaahyada khiyaliga ah:** Visualization *is* part of the process, but it's only *one component* of Kundalini Yoga.
*   **C: Ku celcelinta odhaahyada mantras:** Reciting mantras is a component, but not the sole method of activating chakras.
*   **D: Ku celcelinta jimicsiga neefsiga:** Breathing exercises are part of it, but again, just one piece of the puzzle.

The text clearly indicates a *combination* of techniques are used, making ""qaababka yogada ee kala duwan"" (different yoga practices) the most comprehensive and accurate answer."
yaa soo bandhigay heestii cibaadada ee labaad intii uu socday barnaamijku?,"The correct answer is **D: Jai Shankar Choudhary**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Heesaa Sanju Sharma, waxaa ku xigsaday Jai Shankar Choudhary."" (Singer Sanju Sharma, followed by Jai Shankar Choudhary.) This clearly indicates that Jai Shankar Choudhary performed the second bhajan."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, yaa soo bandhigay hees cibaado ah inta la bixinayay cuntada?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lakkha Singh wuxuu qaatay hogaaminta heesta bhajan. Lakkha Singh waxay soo bandhigtay sidoo chhappan bhog bhajan."" This directly indicates Lakkha Singh performed a bhajan while the *chhappan bhog* (the offering of 108 items) was being offered.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jai Shankar Choudhary:** He performed earlier in the evening, not during the offering.
*   **C: Shri Shyam:** Shri Shyam is the deity receiving the offerings, not the performer.
*   **D: Sanju Sharma:** He started the evening's performances, but not during the offering of food."
Maxay ahayd bandhiggii labaad ee ugu dambeeyay cawayskii?,"The correct answer is **B: Dabka Anadoolka**.

Here's why:

The text lists the performances in order. The last performance mentioned is the Turkish Fire of Anatolia group and their ""equilibrium system"" program. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina and Haris Alexiou** - This was earlier in the evening.
*   **C: Darwiish-wareega** - This was before Sezen Aksu and the others.
*   **D: Fatih Erkoç iyo Müslüm Gürses** - This was even earlier in the sequence.



"
Dhalashada Alessandro Safina waa maxay?,"The correct answer is **D: Talyaani**.

The text states that Alessandro Safina is an *Italian* artist who performed with Sezen Aksu.

"Iyada oo lagu salaynayo qoraalka, weedhahan soo socda kee baa aan run ahayn?","Haa, jawaabta saxda ah waa **A: Dab ayaa ka kacay Santa Kalara**.

Halkan sababta:

*   **Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa:** Rakaabka waxaa la saiiyay biyo intay kulka 90(f) digrii ah wax ku sugayeen. Kabtanka dabdamiska, Skot Kouns, wuxu yidhi “ Santa Clara maalintu way kululayd heerkulkuna waxa uu ahaa 90meeyo. Waqti kasta oo qofku ku xayiran yahay roolar koostarku waa mid bilaa raaxo ah, markay ugu yartahay, waxaanay ku qaadatay ugu yaraan hal saac in qofkii u horeeyay la soo rogo.""
*   **A (Dab ayaa ka kacay Santa Kalara):** Qoraalku ma sheego in dab ka kacay. Wuxuu kaliya sheegayaa in ay jiraan rakaab ku xayiran roollar.
*   **B (Dadku waxay ahaayeen kuwo ku dhegen roollo koostar):** Qoraalku si cad u sheegayaa in dadku ay ku xayiran yihiin roollar.
*   **C (Rakaabkii waxaa la siiyay biyo):** Qoraalku si cad u sheegayaa in rakaabka la siiyay biyo.
*   **D (Waxay qaadatay ugu yaraan 60 daqiiqo in qofka ugu horreeya laga soo saaro baabuurka):** Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa in ay qaadatay ""ugu yaraan hal saac"" (60 daqiiqo) in qofka ugu horeeya laga soo saaro.

Sidaa darteed, A waa jawaabta kaliya ee aan ku salaysnayn qoraalka."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, yaa faallo ka bixiyay heerka kulaylka aan raaxada lahayn?","The correct answer is **B: Kabtanka dab damiska**.

The text specifically states: ""Kabtanka dabdamiska, Skot Kouns, wuxu yidhi “ Santa Clara maalintu way kululayd heerkulkuna waxa uu ahaa 90meeyo. Waqti kasta oo qofku ku xayiran yahay roolar koostarku waa mid bilaa raaxo ah..."" 

This means Skot Kouns (the fire captain) is the one who commented on the uncomfortable heat.
"
Halkee ka dhacday koronto la’aan ka dhalatay dhaq-dhaqaaqa sunaami?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

The passage states: ""Wax dhaawacyo ama burbur wayn laguma sheegayn Tonga, balse korontada ayaa si ku meel gaar ah u tagtay..."" (There were no major injuries or damage reported in Tonga, but the power went out temporarily...). This directly links the power outage to Tonga."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, sidee Tonga u saamaysay koronto la’aantu?","The correct answer is **B: Maamulka ayaan helin wax war ah oo ku saabsanaa digniinaha la qaaday.**

The text explicitly states: ""korontada ayaa si ku meel gaar ah u tagtay, taasoo sida la sheegay maamulka Tongan u diiday inay helaan digniinta suunaamida ay soo saareen PTWC.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waxoogaa khasaare ah ayaa la soo sheegay** - The text states no major damage or injuries were reported.
*   **C: Akhrinta heerka badda ayay saameysay** - While sea level readings were taken, the text doesn’t say the power outage affected those readings *in Tonga*.
*   **D: Maamulka ayaa awoodi waayay inay helaan digniino la xiriira** - While very similar to the correct answer, ""wax war ah oo ku saabsanaa digniinaha la qaaday"" is more precise and directly from the text."
Goorma ayay booliisku awood u yeesheen inay adeegsadaan qoryahoodii raadaarka si ay u cabiraan xawaaraha Jonny Reid?,"The correct answer is **A: Markuu ku socday xawaare dhan 160 km/saacad**.

Here's why:

The text states that the police had difficulty using speed cameras because the car (""Black Beauty"") was going *so fast* they couldn't get an accurate reading. They *were* able to get a reading when he slowed down to 160 km/h.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Markii toddobaad ee uu dul marayay buundada:** The number of times he crossed the bridge is irrelevant to when they could use the radar.
*   **C: Markuu ku socday xawaare ka badan 160 km/saacad:** The text says they *couldn't* get a reading when he was going faster.
*   **D: Markii ugu horeysay ee uu dul maro buundada:** There is no indication in the text that this is when they were able to use the radar."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxay ugu adkeyd booliska New Zealand inay saacada xawaaraha Jonny Reid cabiraan?","The correct answer is **B: Baabuurka ayaa ahaa mid aad u hooseeya**.

The text states: ""Booliska New Zealand waxa ay dhib ku qabeyn isticmaalka qoryaha raaderka xawaare marka la fiiriyo xawaaraha uu mudane Reid ku socday sababto ah sida ay u gaabiyan Black Beauty..."" This directly translates to ""The New Zealand police had difficulty using speed guns to measure Mr. Reid’s speed because of how low to the ground Black Beauty was...""  Meaning the car was so low that it was difficult to get a reading on it."
Halkee ayuu dhulgariirku xuddun u ahaa marka lo eego Butte?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 mayl koonfur (40 miles south)**.

The text states the earthquake's epicenter was ""south of Butte by 65 km (40 miles)"". Therefore, it was 40 miles south of Butte."
Maxaa dhacay intii lagu guda jiray rabshadahii Abu Ghraib?,"The correct answer is **D: Xabsiga ayaa dab la qabadsiiyay**.

The passage specifically states, ""Xabsiga Abu Gharib ee Ciraaq ayaa dab la qabadsiiyay intii rabshaduhu socdeen.""  The other options are related to Abu Ghraib, but don't describe what *happened during the unrest*.



"
Waa maxay sababta xabsiga Ciraaq uu sumcad u yeeshay? ,"The correct answer is **D: Helitaanka xadgudubka maxaabiista (Discovery of prisoner abuse)**.

The passage states the prison ""became notorious when its abuses came to light"" after US forces took control. Therefore, the reason for the prison's bad reputation is the discovered abuse of prisoners.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dab ayaa la qabadsiiyay (It was set on fire)** - This happened *during* the unrest, not as the reason for its notoriety.
*   **B: Ciidamada Maraykanka ayaa la wareegay (US forces took over)** - While the US taking over led to the discovery of abuse, it wasn't the abuse itself.
*   **C: Waxaa dhacay rabshado badan (There were many riots)** -  The unrest happened *after* the prison was already infamous."
Dhacdo noocee ah ayaa ahayd in lagu qabto garoonka Xusuusta Dagaalka Maui?,"The correct answer is **C: Show heeso**

The text states the event was a ""bandhig"" (show) planned for a music group with around 9,000 people attending. This indicates it was a music performance or a show of songs."
Yaa ugu dambeyntii bixiyay sharraxaad ku saabsan joojinta munaasabadda?,"The correct answer is **B: Shirkadda maamulka**.

Here's why:

The passage states that HK Management Inc. (the management company) *initially* didn't give a reason, but *then* provided the explanation of poor preparation the day after cancelling the event.  Therefore, the management company is the one who ultimately gave the explanation.



"
Kumay u maleeyeen qaar badan oo ka mid ah dadka deggan Bishkek in ay mas'uul ka ahaayeen bililiqada?,"The correct answer is **C: Mudaaharaadayaasha**.

The text states: ""In kamida deeganka Bishkek ayaa eedeynaya **mudaaharadlayaasah ka yimid koonfurta** shari la'aanta ka jirto."" This directly translates to ""Some residents of Bishkek are blaming **the protesters from the south** for the unrest.""

Therefore, many people in Bishkek believed the protesters were responsible for the looting."
Yaa ku eedeeyay mudaharaadayaasha koonfurta ka soo jeeda inay ka dambeeyaan bililiqada?,"The correct answer is **A: Dadka degan Bishkek**.

The text states: ""In kamida deeganka Bishkek ayaa eedeynaya mudaaharadlayaasah ka yimid koonfurta shari la'aanta ka jirto."" This directly translates to ""Some residents of Bishkek are blaming the protesters from the south for the chaos."""
Goorma ayay tijaabada dhawaqa Ring kordhisay iibka?,"The correct answer is **A: Kadib markay kasoo dul muuqatay Shark Tank**.

The passage states: ""iibka waxa kor u qaaday ka soo muuqashadiisii uu ka muuqday Shark Tank 2013kii"". This directly links the increase in sales to the appearance on Shark Tank."
Goorma ayuu Jamie Siminoff go'aansaday inuu bilaabo tijaabada dhawaqa Ring?,"Jawaabta saxda ah waa **A: Ka dib markii uu ogaaday in gambaleelka albaabkiisu aanu ku filnayn**.

Qoraalka ayaa si cad u sheegaya in Jamie Siminoff uu bilaabay shirkadda kadib markii gambaleelka albaabkiisu aan laga maqli karin dukaan garaashiisa."
Xalqad kasta oo kamida taxanaha Akhriska Qaansoroobaadka waxay ciyaalka usoo bandhigtay talooyin maxay ah?,"The correct answer is **D: Buugaag**.

The passage states: ""... Bandhig walbo ayaa sidoo kale talo bixin siin dono caruurta buugaga ay ka raadsan doonaan maktabada markay tagaan."" This directly indicates that each episode provided recommendations for *books*."
Maxaa laga yaabaa in ay gacan ka geysteen joojinta taxanaha Akhriska Qaansoroobaadka?,"The correct answer is **A: Maalgelin aan ku filneyn**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dadka qaar ayaa rumaysan, sida John Grant, in go’aanka maalgelineed iyo isbeddelka falsafadeed ee waxbarashada talafeeshinku ay gacan ka geysteen dhammaynta taxanaha.""  This directly links the end of the show to financial decisions (maalgelineed).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: La'aanta abaal-marinnada Emmy:** The passage actually states the show *received* many Emmy awards, so this isn't a reason for cancellation.
*   **C: Fikirka John Grant:** John Grant's opinion is presented *as* a possible reason, not *the* reason itself. The passage points to broader financial and philosophical shifts.
*   **D: Guusha Xaafadda Mister Rogers:** While the passage mentions the show's ranking compared to Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, it doesn't suggest the latter's success led to the former's cancellation.



"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan ahayn dood ay sameeyeen saraakiisha Amsterdam iyo matxafka ee ku saabsan geedka?,"The correct answer is **B: Waa in la dhowraa (It needs to be protected)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states the officials wanted to *cut down* the tree** because of the fungal disease and safety concerns. Protecting it is the opposite of their stated intention.
*   **A: Waa lama huraan in ay dumin doonto (It must be cut down)** - This *is* a view of the officials.
*   **C: Waxay ku wasakhowday fangas (It is infected with fungus)** - This is stated directly in the text.
*   **D: Waxay khatar ku tahay caafimaadka bulshada (It is a danger to public health)** - This is also stated directly in the text.



"
"Marka loo eego Kormeeraha Sare ee RSPCA, howlgalada kormeeridu waa inay noqdaan heerka midkee kamid ah kuwan soo socda?","The correct answer is **A: kamaradaha Ammaanka**.

Here's why:

The passage states the RSPCA is advocating for **mandatory CCTV in all slaughterhouses**. The inspector general believes this will make monitoring and oversight ""routine"".  This directly links the desired level of operation to the use of security cameras.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Qof kasta oo la shaqeeya xoolaha:** While important, the passage focuses on the *method* of oversight, not the people involved.
*   **C: qalabka kormeerka:** This is too broad. CCTV is a specific type of inspection equipment.
*   **D: Kawaannada:** This is irrelevant to the passage's focus on monitoring.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa gacan ka geysan kara in la aasaaso muhiimada ay leedahay u dhimrinta xoolaha ee shaqaalaha kawaanka Australia?","The correct answer is **A: Ku rakibida Kamaradaha Ammaanka** (Installing security cameras).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that David O'Shannessy believes ""CCTV-da waxa ay fariin culus u direysa dadka ka shaqeeyo xayawaanada in bad qabkoodu yahay muhiimada koowaad"" (CCTV sends a strong message to people working with animals that their welfare is the priority).  This directly links CCTV installation to emphasizing animal welfare to staff.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kulamo qasab ah oo lala yeesho RSPCA** - The text doesn't mention mandatory meetings.
* **C: Kormeero joogto ah oo kawaannada xoolaha** - While the text mentions increased inspection, it specifically highlights CCTV as the key tool to make inspection commonplace and to *deter* bad behavior.
* **D: Kormeer dhanka ABC** - The text doesn't mention ABC inspections.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, waa maxay shaqada qofka la xidhay?","The correct answer is **A: Arday**.

The text specifically states: ""in ardey kale lagu xidhay iyadoo lala xidhiidhinayo..."" which translates to ""another **student** was arrested in connection with..."".
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, iyada oo wararka faafay sheegayan in la qabtay qof kale, ayadoo janaasooyin loo sameenayay imisa dhibanayaal ah?","The correct answer is **B: Sadex**.

The text states ""jeff iyo sadex kale oo dhibanayaan ahi"" (Jeff and three other victims) reported the arrest. This implies that, at the time of the report, there were at least three victims involved (and potentially more, but we know of at least three). Since funerals were being held for victims, and the report comes after the shooting, it's reasonable to infer they were funerals for the three victims mentioned.
"
"Iyadoo laga jawaab celinayo mudaaharaadyada, waddankee ayaan horay ugu socon heshiiskii ACTA ee ay saxiixeen?","The correct answer is **B: Poland**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bishii la soo dhaafay, muddaharaado waawayn ayaa ka dhacay Poland markii waddankaasi saxeexay ACTA, taasoo dawladda Poland ku riixday inaanay saxeexin heshiiska, hadda uun."" This clearly indicates that Poland initially signed ACTA but reversed its decision due to the protests.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jarmalka:** The text only mentions demonstrations *in* Germany, not that they signed or rescinded ACTA.
*   **C: Iskootlan:** Demonstrations happened in Edinburgh and Glasgow, but Scotland is part of the UK, and the text doesn't state the UK's actions on ACTA.
*   **D: Litwaaniya:** Vilnius, Lithuania had demonstrations, but the text doesn't mention Lithuania signing or withdrawing from ACTA."
"Sida ku cad qoraalka, wadamada soo socda kee baa go'aansaday inuu dib u dhigo habka ku biirista ACTA?","The correct answer is **D: Laatfiya**.

The text states: ""Latvia and Slovakia waxay labadooduba dib u dhigeen ku biiristooda ACTA."" (Latvia and Slovakia have both postponed their accession to ACTA.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Istooniya:** The text mentions Estonia as a place where protests occurred, but doesn't say they postponed joining ACTA.
*   **B: Litwaaniya:** The text mentions Lithuania as a place where protests occurred, but doesn't say they postponed joining ACTA.
*   **C: Iskootlan:** The text mentions Edinburgh and Glasgow (in Scotland) as places where protests occurred, but doesn't say Scotland postponed joining ACTA (as Scotland is part of the UK, not a separate signatory to treaties like ACTA)."
Immisa qof ayaa ku dhaawacmay shilalka kulaylka xad dhaafka ah ee qalabka iPod ka?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The text states: ""...four people sustained minor burns."" This directly answers the question about the number of people injured."
Yaa sheegay in shilalka kulaylku aanay ahayn kuwo aad u daran?,"The correct answer is **D: Apple**.

The text states: ""Wasaaradda dhaqaalaha, ganacsiga iyo warshadaha ee Jabbaan ( meti) ayaa sheegtay inay ka warheshay 27 shil oo la xariiro aaladaha. Isbuuca lasoo dhaafay, METI ayaa ku dhawaaqday in Apple ay ogeysiyeen dhacdooyin kuleel xad dhaaf ah, ay shirkadda ku tilmaantay “kuwa aan muhiim ahayn.”""

This clearly indicates that Apple described the overheating incidents as ""not significant."""
Muxuu Steve Jobs sheegay markuu hadalka soo jeedinayay in Apple ay dib u curin doonto?,"The correct answer is **B: Taleefanka**

The text states Steve Jobs said, ""Maanta Apple waxay rabtaa inay dib u ikhtiraacdo telefoonka..."" (Today Apple wants to reinvent the phone...). 

Therefore, he said Apple would reinvent the *phone*."
Maxay ahayd ujeedada Steve Jobs khudbadii labada saacadood ahayd?,"The correct answer is **C: Si loo soo saaro taleefan cusub**.

The text explicitly states Steve Jobs said, ""Maanta Apple waxay rabtaa inay dib u ikhtiraacdo telefoonka, Maanta waxaynu dhigaynaa taariikh,"" which clearly indicates the purpose of the speech was to announce a new phone. He then *took an iPhone out of his pocket* which further confirms this.
"
Maxay bay Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner kaga dhawaaqday Tiyaatarka Arjantiin?,"The correct answer is **A: Musharaxnimadeeda madaxweyne** (Her candidacy for president).

The text explicitly states: ""Mrs. Kirchner waxay ku dhawaaqday inay u tartamayso madaxwaynaha Tiyaatarma Argentina"" which translates to ""Mrs. Kirchner announced her candidacy for president at the Argentina Theater.""
"
Halkee bay Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner kaga dhawaaqday rabitaankeeda inay tartanto?,"The correct answer is **B: Tiyaatarka Buenos Aires ee La Plata**.

Here's why:

* The text states she announced her candidacy in La Plata.
* It specifically mentions the location as ""Tiyaatarma Argentina"" *in* La Plata.
* The 31 miles/50 kilometers detail just clarifies the distance from Buenos Aires, it's not part of the location name.



"
Maxay ahaayeen natiijooyinka ACMA ee ku saabsan Walaalka Wayn?,"The correct answer is **A: Sharciyada faafreebka laguma xadgudbin**.

The passage explicitly states: ""ACMA waxay ogaatay in inkastoo muuqalka khadka lagu dhex daawaday aanay Big Brother jebin shuruucda faafreebka khadka maadaama xogtu aanay ku kaydsanayn websaytka Big Brother."" (ACMA found that even though the online appearance was watched, Big Brother did not break the laws of online deception because the information was not stored on the Big Brother website.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage says the information *wasn't* stored on the Big Brother website.
*   **C:** The passage explicitly says the deception laws were *not* broken.
*   **D:** The passage states the information was *not* stored on the Big Brother server."
Waa maxay xuduudaha ay tahay in warbaahintu ay hoos gasho si loogu tixgeliyo inay tahay xog intarneet?,"The correct answer is **A: Waa in lagu sii daayo internetka** (It must be released onto the internet).

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Sharciga Adeega Warbahinta wuxuu ogolanayaa intarneetka, si kasto ay tahay intarneetka waxaa loo tix geliya ogolaansho, waayo wuxuu jir ahaan galayaa xog keediyaha."" (The Media Services Act allows the internet, however the internet is considered consent because it physically enters the data keeper).  This means simply *being available* on the internet is enough to be considered as having been communicated/distributed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Waa in ay si dhab ah ugu jirtaa server-ka** (It must physically be on the server) - The passage implies it doesn't need to *be* on a server, just *accessible* via the internet. The ACMA found Big Brother didn't break the rules even though the data wasn't *stored* on their website.
*   **C: Laguma kaydin karo degelka internetka ah** (It cannot be saved on the website) - This is directly contradicted by the passage. The ACMA acknowledged the data wasn't stored on Big Brother's website, yet it *still* met the criteria for online transmission.
*   **D: Waa in laga ogolaado dhanka ACMA** (It must be approved by ACMA) - The passage doesn't mention any need for ACMA approval. It focuses on whether the material is accessible on the internet.



"
Waa kuma hogaamiyaha xisbiga Liberal ka ee Australia?,"The correct answer is **B: John Howard**.

The text states Peter Costello is *expected* to replace John Howard as the leader of the Liberal party. This means John Howard is the current leader. While Costello is mentioned as a potential successor, he isn't the current leader.



"
Waa maxay sababta Australiya aysan u lahayn warshad tamarta nukliyeerka ah?,"The correct answer is **B: Muran badan ka taagan yahay**.

Here's why:

The passage states Peter Costello believes nuclear power *could* be economically viable for Australia, and that there are no *legal* obstacles. This implies the barriers are not legal, but rather other issues.  While the other options could be factors, the passage doesn't explicitly mention them.  The fact he feels the need to state there are no legal issues suggests there's public or political debate and disagreement - a ""muran badan.""

Here's why the other options are less likely based on the passage:

*   **A: Taageero la'aan dadwayne:**  The passage doesn't directly mention public opinion.
*   **C: Aad khatar u ah:** The passage doesn't discuss safety concerns.
*   **D: Aad u qaali ah:** Costello says it *could* be economically successful, suggesting cost isn't the primary barrier.



"
Waa kee iskeerka tartamay isagoo kaashanaya hage?,"The correct answer is **C: Maciej Krezel**.

The text specifically states: ""Ragga aragga naafada ka ah ee Poland ee skier Maciej Krezel iyo hagaha Anna Ogarzynska waxay ku dhamaysteen booska saddex iyo tobnaad ee tartarka Baraf ku sibqidda (Super-G).""  This indicates Maciej Krezel is the skier who competed *with* a guide (Anna Ogarzynska).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Anna Jochemsen** - Competed independently in the Super-G.
*   **B: Jong Seork Park** - Competed independently in sitting Super-G.
*   **D: Anna Ogarzynska** - She is the *guide* for Maciej Krezel, not the skier.



"
Wadankee ku dhameystay kaalinta tobnaad ee Super-G ee heerka haweenka?,"The correct answer is **A: Fiiland**.

The text states: ""Finland, Katja Saarinen kuna dhameysatay numberka tobanaad ee tartanka kaluumeysiga Super-G shalay."" (Finland, Katja Saarinen finished in tenth place in yesterday's Super-G competition.)"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, weedhee ku saabsan Blake ee aan sax ahayn?","Jawabta saxda ah waa **B: Wuu qirtay weerarka**.

Qoraalka ayaa sheegaya inuu diiday inuu weeraray, wuxuuna ku andacooday inuu u isticmaalay usha si uu isaga difaaco dhalooyinka. Marka, ma qirin weerarka.

Halkan waxa laga arki karaa sababaha kale ee jawabta ka dhacay:

*   **A: Isla goobtii dhacdada ayaa lagu xiray** - Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa inuu lagu xiray goobta.
*   **C: Inta uu weerarka socday waxa uu adeegsaday tiir** - Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa inuu isticmaalay usha.
*   **D: Wuxuu ku andacoodey in dhalooyinka asaga lagu soo tuuray** - Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa inuu ku andacooday in dhalooyinka lagu soo tuuray."
"Iyada oo lagu salaynayo qoraalka, midkee kuwan soo socda aan ku dhicin Blake?","Jawaabta saxda ah waa **C: Waxa lagu soo weeraray tiir**.

Qoraalka waxa ku cad in dad badan ay Blake kusoo tuureen dhalooyinka, laakiin ma sheegayo inuu tiir lagu soo weeraray. Qoraalka waxa ku cad:

*   **A:** Blake waxaa lagu cadeeyey inuu isku dayay dhinac u weecin cadaalada ah.
*   **B:** Blake waxaa lagu xiray goobta.
*   **D:** Xaakimkii ayaa u sheegay Blake inay “ku dhawaad midaan la seegin karayn ahayd” inuu jeel galo."
Maxaa lacagaha kulaylka caalamiga ee Qaramada Midoobay aan loo isticmaali doonin?,"The correct answer is **A: Kala duwanaansiinta dalagyada (Diversification of crops)**.

The passage states the money *will* be used for:

*   Building flood-resistant homes
*   Better water management
*   Diversifying crop production

The question asks what it *won't* be used for. While diversifying crops *is* something the money will be used for, it's the only option listed that is directly mentioned as a use of the funds. The other options (B, C, and D) are either things the money *will* be used for or broader goals the UN is working towards, but not specifically how the money will be spent.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxay UN-tu rajaynaysaa inay badbaadsato?","The correct answer is **C: Kaymaha roobka ee haray**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mawduucyada kale ee Bali ajandaha ugu jiray waxa ka mid ah in la badbaadiyo **kaymaha adduunka ee haray**..."" 

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Lacagta, iyada oo loo marayo wadaagga tignoolajiyada** - While the UN hopes to *allocate* funds, they aren't trying to *save* money.
*   **B: Dalagga** - The text mentions diversifying crop production as something the funds will *support*, but not as something they are trying to save.
*   **D: Dadka ay saameysay maamul xumada biyaha** - The text mentions better water management as a way to *help* people, but not as something to save.



"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda buusan sheegin Albert Muchanga inuu yahay wax weli u baahan in lagu heshiiyo?,"Jawaabta saxda ah waa **D: Ka dhaafidda canshurta taraafikada**.

Qoraalka ayaa sheegaya in Albert Muchanga uu yiri in weli aysan heshiin shuruucda tacriifadaha. Taas macnaheeda waa canshuuraha laga qaado alaabada la dhoofiyo iyo kuwa la soo dhoofiyo. 

Halkan waxaa ku qoran waxyaalihii kale ee uu sheegay inuu weli u baahan yahay heshiis:

*   **A: Haddii Benin ay ku biiri lahayd AfCTA:** Wuxuu sheegay in Benin ay ku biiri doonto AfCFTA.
*   **B: Taariikhda uu ganacsigu bilaaban karo:** Wuxuu sheegay in ganacsigu bilaaban karo Luulyo 1, 2020.
*   **C: Xeerarka asalka ah:** Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa in weli aysan heshiin shuruucda tacriifadaha, taas oo ka mid ah qodobbada xeerarka asalka ah.

Si kastaba ha ahaatee, canshuurta taraafikada lama sheegin inuu yahay wax weli u baahan in lagu heshiiyo."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa ganacsigu u bilaabman karaa Luulyo?","The correct answer is **B: Waxaa jira qaab ku filan oo xeerar iyo tanaasulaad ah oo meesha yaala** (There is enough framework of rules and concessions in place).

Here's why:

The text states: """"...seeska aanu dhignay wuxu ku filan yahay inaynu ganacsi bilawno Luulyo 1, 2020"""" - which translates to ""...the framework we have put in place is sufficient to start trading from July 1, 2020"".  This directly means there's enough of a basic structure (rules and concessions) to begin trading, *even though* all the tariff schedules aren't finalized.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Nigeria's participation is mentioned, but the text doesn't say Luulyo 1st was *because* of Nigeria's conditions.
* **C:** The chairperson *stated* it could begin, but the *reason* it can begin is the framework in place.
* **D:** The text explicitly says they *haven't* agreed on tariff schedules (""welii kumaanu heshiin shuruucda tacriifadaha"").

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxay Joornaalka-Dastuurka ee Atlanta ku eedeeysay masuulinta waxbarashada?","The correct answer is **C: Aan la tacaalin dhibaatooyinka gudaha ee la ogaaday**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Warbixintu waxay sheegtay in dhibcaha imtixaanku aad u kordheen, wuxuna ku eedeeyay dugsiga inuu mashaakiil gudaha ah dareemay balse aanu waxba ka qaban."" This directly translates to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution accusing the school officials of failing to address internal problems they were aware of.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku xadgudubka warbixinta Joornaalka-Dastuur** - The text doesn't say the officials misused the report, but rather that the report accused them of something.
*   **B: Ku guuldaraysiga hindisida waxbarasho casri ah** - The text highlights achievement in innovative urban education, not a failure to innovate.
*   **D: Ka warbixinta dhibcaha imtixaannada hoose** - The report actually highlighted *increased* test scores and suspected foul play related to that increase.



"
"Iyada oo lagu salaynayo xogta lagu xusay qoraalka, maxaa aan lagu xusin warbixinta Joornaalka-Dastuurka ee Atlanta?","Jawaabta saxda ah waa **C: Ku guuleystaha Kormeeraha Guud ee Qaranka ee 2013.**

Qoraalka wuxuu tilmaamayaa in Hall iyo saraakiil kale la dacwooday sanadkii 2013, laakiin ma xuso qofka ku guulaystay abaalmarinta Kormeeraha Guud ee Qaranka sanadkaas.

Halkan sababaha ay jawaabaha kale u khaldan yihiin:

*   **A: Horumar aan caadi ahayn oo natiijada imtixaanka** - Warbixinta ayaa si cad u tilmaamaysay in dhibcaha imtixaanku ay aad u kordheen.
*   **B: Caddeymo muujinaya in waraaqihii tijaabada la fara geliyey** - Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa in caddeymo ay muujiyeen in warqadaha imtixaanka la bedelay.
*   **D: Talooyin ku saabsan hindisida waxbarashada magaalada** - Warbixintu waxay diirada saartay dhibaatooyinka natiijooyinka imtixaanka, uma jeedin talooyinka waxbarashada.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa xog ah oo la og yahay ka dib qaraxii?","The correct answer is **A: Tirada dhaawaca ee kama dambeystaa**.

Here's why:

*   The text states, ""warar lahubana waxa ay sheegayan in 30 ay dhaawacantay; laakin tirada ugu danbeyse ilaa hadda lama oga"" - which translates to ""some reports suggest 30 were injured; but the final number is still unknown"". This confirms information about the injured is known, but not final.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dhismayaashe bay bambooyinku ku ag qarxeen** - The text only mentions the explosion happened outside a lawyer's office and near a government building, but not specifically *near* the buildings.
*   **C: Haddii bambooyin dheeraad ah la qarxin lahaa** - The text doesn't give any information about whether more explosions are expected.
*   **D: Tirada rasmiga ah ee dhimashada** - The text states a death toll of eight is *reported*, but not *confirmed*, and that the final number is still unknown.

"Tan iyo markii uu ku soo biiray Manchester City 2017, immisa kulan ayuu ciyaaray jesus?","The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The text states: ""Ilaa iyo waqtigaas, Baraasiiligu wuxu ka qayb qaatay **53 ciyaarood** oo tartamada oo dhan ah..."" which translates to ""Since then, Jesus has participated in **53 matches** in all competitions..."""
Kooxdee ayuu Jesus ku helay lacag dhan £27 milyan oo gini si uu ugu biiro?,"The correct answer is **A: Palmeiras**.

The text states: ""...ku biiray Manchester City sannadkii hore Janaayo 2017 isagoo ugaga yimu kooxda Reer Baraasiil ee Palmeiras...""  This means he came *from* Palmeiras to join Manchester City."
Weedhee ku saabsan martida hostel-ka oo aan run ahayn?,"Jawabka saxda ah waa **D: Martida badankeeda waxay ka yimideen magaalada barakeysan.**

Sababta: Qoraalka ayaa sheegaya in martida ay ka yimideen Imaaraadka, taas oo macno ah in ay ka yimideen meel ka baxsan magaalada barakeysan ee Makka. Sidaa darteed, sheegashada ah in badankoodu ay ka yimideen magaalada barakeysan waa been abuur.

Halkan waxa ku qoran sababaha aan jinaa saarista xulafada kale:

*   **A: Martidu waxay u joogeen Maka si ay u soo gutaan waajibaadka xajka** - Qoraalka ayaa sheegay in ay u yimideen ""soo booqashada magaalada barakeysan bilawga xajka barakeysan,"" taas oo si cad u tilmaameeysa in ay u joogeen xajka.
*   **B: Martida qaar ma ahayn muwaadiniin deegaanka ah** - Qoraalka ayaa sheegay in ay ahaayeen muwaadiniin u dhashay Imaaraadka, taas oo ka dhigaysa in qaar ka mid ah ay ahaan jireen muwaadiniin deegaanka ah (Imaaraadka).
*   **C: Martidu waxay halkaas ku sugnaayeen habeenka xajka hortiis** - Qoraalku ma sheegin go'aanka waqtiyada, laakiin wuxuu sheegay in dhacdada ay dhacday ""abbaaro 10 kii subaxnimo,"" taas oo ku dhigan in ay joogeen waqtigaas."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, weedhahan soo socda keebaa run ah?","Jawabta saxda ah waa **C: Martidu waxay halkaas ku sugnaayeen habeenka xajka hortiis**.

Halkan waxaa ah sababta:

*   Qoraalka wuxuu sheegayaa in dadkii dhintay ay ahaayeen ""dad soo xaj tagay oo u yimid in ay soo booqdan magaalada barakeysan bilawga xajka barakeysan"". Taas micnaheedu waa ay ku sugnaayeen meesha ka hor inta xajku bilaaban lahaa.

Halkan waxaa ah sababaha hadhka been abuurantahay:

*   **A: Ma jirin wax dhimasho ah** - Qoraalka si cad u sheegaa in 15 qof ay dhinteen.
*   **B: Dhamaan martida ka soo qayb gashay ayaa ka kala socday dalka isutaga imaaraadka carabta** - Qoraalka wuxuu sheegaa in dadka dhintay ay ahaayeen muwaadiniin ka soo jeeda Imaaraadka, laakiin kuma sheegin in dhamaan dadka safarka ku jiray ay ka kala yimaadeen halkaas.
*   **D: Inta badan martida waxay ahaayeen reer Mekka** - Qoraalka wuxuu sheegaa in dadka dhintay ay ahaayeen dad soo xajinaya, taas micnaheedu waa inaanay ahayn dad ku nool Mekka."
"Iyada oo lagu salaynayo qoraalka, waa maxay macluumaadka aan la xaqiijin ee ku saabsan isku-dhaca?","The correct answer is **C: Saamaynta isku dhaca ugaystay Dhulka**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Waxay wali isu dayeyaan inay xaqiijiyaan wayninka isu dhaca iyo sida aduunka loo saameeyey."" This translates to ""They are still trying to confirm the size of the impact and how the world was affected."" This clearly indicates that the impact's effects on Earth are not yet confirmed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Inta uu le'eg yahay isku dhaca (The size of the impact)** - The text explicitly says they are trying to confirm the size.
*   **B: Goobta uu isku dhaca ka dhacay (Where the impact occurred)** - The text states the impact was ""meel u jirta dhulka 491 meyl"" (491 miles from Earth), so the location is generally known.
*   **D: Goobta burburka (Location of the debris)** - The text says the US Strategic Command is tracking the debris, implying they know where it is.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa weli u baahan in la go'aamiyo oo ku saabsan isku dhaca?","The correct answer is **D: Qiyaasta saxda ah ee shilka**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Saynisiyahanadu waxay wali isu dayeyaan inay xaqiijiyaan wayninka isu dhaca iyo sida aduunka loo saameeyey."" This directly means they still need to determine the exact size/scale of the impact and its effects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yaa daba gali doona burburka:** The text says the US Strategic Command is tracking the debris.
*   **B: Sida xawliga ah ee dayax gacmeedyadu u socdeen wakhtiga isku dhaca uu dhacayay:** The text does not mention the speed of the meteoroids at the time of impact.
*   **C: Sida natiijooyinka falanqaynta sirta ah loo wadaagi doono:** The text says the results will be published on a public website.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, booskee ayuu mar kaga jiray Batten dadka Maraykanka ugu qanisan?","The correct answer is **C: 190aad**.

The text explicitly states: ""Batten waxa la geliyay kaalinta 190aad ee 400 ee qof ee Ameerika ugu qanisan..."" (Batten was ranked 190th out of 400 of the wealthiest Americans...)."
Kuwaan soo socda keebuu Batten ugu deeqay wax?,"The correct answer is **B: Jaamacadda Virginia**.

The text specifically states ""Waxa uu deeq bixye wayn u ahaa machadkaas"" (He was a major donor to that institution) and ""kuleejka Sayniska & Artiska ee Jaamacada Virginia"" (College of Arts & Sciences at the University of Virginia).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Liiska dadka ugu qanisan Maraykanka** - He *was on* the list, but he didn't donate *to* the list.
*   **C: Tiro weyn oo machadyo ah** - While possible, the text only mentions one specific institution.
*   **D: Kulliyadaha u heellan fanka iyo sayniska** - This is too general. The text names a specific college within a university."

The text specifically states the law ""prohibits the sale or rental of violent video games or games that depict graphic violence"" and includes a penalty for selling to minors in California. This directly translates to banning the sale/rental of violent games to youth *within* California.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ganaax lacageed oo loogu talagalay dembiilayaasha:** While the text *mentions* a $1000 fine, this is a *part* of the law, not the main focus or what the law is *about*.
*   **C: Mamnuucida iibinta ama kiraynta ciyaaraha fiidiyowga rabshadaha leh ee da'yarta inta ka baxsan California:** The law applies within California only.
*   **D: Shuruudda caddaynta ciyaaraha rabshadaha wata:** The law doesn't discuss requiring labeling of *all* violent games, only requiring a warning on those sold in California.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, yay seegtay waxyaabihii la sheegay?","The correct answer is **C: Miller**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Duvall didn't offer any opinion on the matter. Miller, when asked for his opinion, said he didn't hear what Duvall was saying (""...I was preparing and didn't really hear what he was saying""). This clearly indicates Miller missed the details.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Caruurta Duvall** - The text doesn't mention whether the children heard or missed anything.
*   **B: Mayk** - The passage states Mike (presumably Duvall) *was* speaking, so he didn't miss anything he said.
*   **D: Duvall** - Duvall deliberately did not share his opinion, he didn't miss hearing something.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwan soo socda keebaa khuseeya waayo-aragnimada kullanka maqalka ee Miller?","The correct answer is **B: Ma uusan ahayn mid usoo jeeda intii uu is diyaarinayay.**

Here's why:

The text directly states, ""Waan is diyaarinaayey marka si fiican uma maqal wuxuu sheegaayey."" This translates to ""I was preparing, and therefore didn't hear well what he was saying."" This clearly indicates Miller wasn't paying attention *because* he was preparing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Duvall waxa uu ku raad reebay Miller intii lagu jiray dhagaysiga** - The text says Duvall didn't offer an opinion, not that he was pursuing Miller.
*   **C: Labada caruur ee Duvall ayaa aad u hadlay intii lagu jiray kullanka dhageysiga** - The text doesn't mention the children speaking at all.
*   **D: Waxa uu aad ugu fiirsanayay sheekada Duvall** - The text states the opposite; Miller wasn't listening well to Duvall.



"
Yaa soo jeediyay in dib u eegis lagu sameeyo ‘Xeerka Hawada Nadiifka’?,"The correct answer is **C: Jack Layton**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Layton ayaa codsaday in isbedelo lagu sameeyo sharciga bay’adda ay soo bandhigayaan xisbiga conservative-ka inta ay kula jireen shirka Raysul Wasaaraha, isagoo codsanaayo “dib u qoraal dhamaystiraan oo na buuxo” in lagu sameeyo sharciga bay’adda ay soo bandhigayaan xisbiga conservative-ka.""  This directly translates to Layton requesting a review and revisions to the Clean Air Act.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: John Howard:** The text says John Howard defended the law, he didn't suggest a review.
*   **B: Xisbiga muxaafidka ah (Conservative Party):** The text states Layton requested changes *to* the Conservative's bill.
*   **D: Istifen Harper:** While Harper agreed to send the bill to committees for review after speaking with Layton, Layton was the one who *initiated* the request for a review.



"
"""Yaa beeniyay in """"Xeerka Hawada Nadiifka"""" loo isticmaalay show ahaan doorashada kahor?""","The correct answer is **B: Raysal wasaaraha (The Prime Minister)**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Balse Ra’iisul Wasaaraha John Howard waxa uu yidhi sharcigu waxa keliya loogu talo galay in cusbitaalka lagaga ilaaliyo inay hoos u dhigto dawladda Tasmaaniya..."" This means the Prime Minister (John Howard) is the one denying the accusation that the Clean Air Act was used as an election ploy. He is explaining the *reason* for the law, contradicting the idea it was just for show before the election.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mas'uul ka tirsan maamulka gobolka (A state administration official):** The text says the state government *criticized* the law, not that they denied it was for political gain.
*   **C: Hogaamiyaha Xisbiga Dimuqraadiga Qaranka (Leader of the National Democratic Party):** Jack Layton (NDP leader) requested changes to the bill, implying criticism, not denial of political motivation.
*   **D: Xildhibaan federaal ah (A federal MP):** Some federal MPs criticized the law, but the text doesn’t state they denied the electioneering aspect.



"
Maxay sameeyeen oo ka dhashay compounds-ka cyanuric acid iyo melamine markii ay isku falceliyeen kaadida bisadda?,"The correct answer is **C: Kiristaalo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Baarayaasha waxay arkeen wiriqyo kasameysan kaadida bisada iyadoo ay weheliso iskudarka melamine iyo cyanuric acid."" and ""Waxyaalaha uu ka koobanyahay kiristalkani wuxuu matalaa...""

This clearly indicates that the reaction between cyanuric acid and melamine in the cat's urine *formed crystals*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kalyaha** - The kidneys are where the problem originates (they aren't being *made*).
*   **B: Cuntada xayawaanka** - The contaminated food *caused* the problem, but it isn't what the compounds formed.
*   **D: Infrared spectroscopy** - FTIR is a *method used to analyze* the crystals, not what they are.



"
Maxay cilmi-baarayaashu u isticmaaleen spectroscopy infrared si ay u eegaan?,"The correct answer is **B: Samaysanka Kiristaalada kaadida xayawaanada Rabaayada ah**.

Here's why:

The text states that researchers used FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy) to analyze the **composition of crystals found in the urine** and compared them to crystals formed from melamine and cyanuric acid. This indicates they were using spectroscopy to understand *what* the crystals were made of, thus studying their formation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shaqada kelyaha** - While kidney function is related to the issue (as the crystals form in the urinary tract), the text doesn't say they used spectroscopy *to study kidney function* directly.
*   **C: Xayawaanada Rabaayada ee dhibaataysan** - They studied the urine of affected animals, but the spectroscopy was used on the crystals themselves, not the animals.
*   **D: Cuntada xayawaanada Rabaayada oo wasakhaysan** - The contaminated food *caused* the problem, but the spectroscopy was used to analyze the resulting crystals, not the food directly."
"""Yaa Luna ugu yeeray """"Boqoradda Xad-jirka ah""""?""","The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The text states: ""Tommy Dreamer waxa uu dhahay """"Luna waxa ay aheyd boqoradii koowaad ee Aadka."""" which translates to ""Tommy Dreamer said """"Luna was the first Queen of Extreme."""" 

Therefore, Tommy Dreamer is the one who called Luna ""Queen of Extreme"".



"
"""Yaa Luna ugu yeeray """"halista""""?""","The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

Here's why:

The text states: """"Tommy Dreamer waxa uu dhahay """"Luna waxa ay aheyd boqoradii koowaad ee Aadka."""""", which translates to ""Tommy Dreamer said """"Luna was the first queen of the Extreme."""""". While not directly calling her a ""threat"", referring to her as the ""first queen of the Extreme"" is a powerful statement *from* Tommy Dreamer.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Taageeraheda** - The text mentions fans finding Luna ""amazing"" but doesn't state they called her a ""threat"".
*   **B: Dustin Runnels** - Dustin Runnels is not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Baarayaal dawladeed** - The text says investigators issued ""black notices"" related to her, not that they called her a ""threat"".



"
Maxay ayaan ku dhicin darawalkii bur-burka ku lug lahaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Waxaa ka soo gaaray dhaawac madaxa ah** (He suffered a head injury).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Waxa madaxa ka soo gaadhay dhaawac khatara."" (The driver suffered a serious head injury).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While true (no one inside the house was hurt), this isn't *what happened to the driver*.
* **C:** This is incorrect. He was moved *from* Great Yarmouth *to* Cambridge.
* **D:** This describes the *rescue* efforts, not the injury itself.



"
Maxay ahayd wax aan ka muuqan qaab ciyaareedka Koonfur Afrika inta lagu guda jiro tartanka rugby?,"The correct answer is **A: Shaqo kooxeed wanaagsan** (Good teamwork).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...shaqada ay qabteen kooxda oo aad u wanaagsaneyd wayna iska cadeed iney kooxdan badin doonaan."" ( ""...the work done by the team was very good and it was clear this team would win."").

While the passage also mentions defense and ball handling, the *distinctive* aspect highlighted as contributing to their win is the teamwork.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Karti maaraynta kubbadda (Ball management skills):**  It mentions ball handling, but doesn't emphasize it as a standout quality.
*   **C: Bandhig aad u quruxsan bilowgii tartanka (A very strong start to the competition):** The passage mentions their initial score (26-00), but doesn't highlight it as a *characteristic* of their overall play. It focuses on their continued performance *throughout* the match.
*   **D: Xirfadaha difaaca (Defensive skills):** It mentions their defense was good, but teamwork is the defining aspect presented as the reason for their win.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, goorma ayay ciyaarta Koonfur Afrika bilowday inay soo wanaagsanaato?","The correct answer is **D: Hadba sidii tartanku usii socday**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Iyadoo si wayn daal uga muuqdo ciyaarta ay la leedahay walaalaheeda koonfureed, Koonfur Afrika waxay si kastaba ha ahaatee si joogto ah uga soo raysay intay ciyaartu socotay.""  This directly translates to ""Despite appearing tired in their game against their southern siblings, South Africa continued to improve *as the game went on*.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Abbaaraha 10:00 subaxnimo** - The game started at 10:00 AM, but the text doesn't say they played *well* then.
*   **B: Ka dib markii la adkeeyay difaaca** - The text doesn't mention a moment where the defense was strengthened that led to improvement. It highlights their good defense *throughout* the game.
*   **C: Kadib guuldaradii kasoo gaartay Zambia** - The text states they were ahead 26-0 against Zambia and doesn't indicate a prior loss.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, keebaa weedhahan soo socda aan si sax ah uga tarjumaynin dhaqaalaha Shiinaha?","The correct answer is **D: Shiinuhu waligiis ma dhoofin baabuur ka badan tan Jarmalka.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Markii ugu horeysay, sanadkii tagay Shiinaha ayaa dhoofiyay in badan gawaarida Jarmalku dhoofiyo...""  This *directly contradicts* the statement that China has *never* exported more cars than Germany.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate based on the text:

*   **A: Dhaqaalaha Shiinaha si aad ah ayuu u koray tan iyo markii la sameeyay dib u habeyn** - The text states the economy grew 90 times after the initial reforms, supporting this statement.
*   **B: Shiinuhu wuxuu leeyahay suuq dhoofinta baabuurta oo ka weyn kan Maraykanka** - The text explicitly says China surpassed Germany and became the largest car export market, meaning it's larger than the US market.
*   **C: Shiinaha ayaa ugu dambeyntii yeelan kara wax soo saarka maxaliga ah ee GDP ka weyn kan Mareykanka** - The text states China’s GDP surpassed that of the USA in two years, supporting the statement that it could have a larger GDP than the USA.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, goorma ayuu wax soo saarka maxaliga ee GDP-ga Shiinaha uu dhaafi karaa kan Mareykanka?","The correct answer is **A: Kadib dib-u-habayn dhaqaale oo dheeraad ah**.

Here's why:

The text states that China's GDP *has already* surpassed that of the US ""within two years"".  The question asks *when* it will surpass the US, and the text already confirms it has happened. The text indicates this was achieved through economic reforms, so further economic reform will be needed to continue this trend. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Labaatan sano gudahood:** The text says it already happened in two years, not that it *will* happen in twenty.
* **C: Marka uu dalku yeesho hoggaan cusub:** While leadership changes can influence the economy, the text focuses on *economic reforms* as the key driver.
* **D: Soddon sano gudahood:** Again, the text states the surpassing has *already* occurred.



"
Muxuu Hu u soo jeediyay in wadamada soo koraya ay sameeyaan?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka fogaanshaha dariiqyadii hore ee wasakhaynta**.

Here's why:

The passage states Hu ""encouraged developing countries to 'avoid the old path of polluting first, cleaning up later.'"" This directly translates to avoiding the previously common approach of prioritizing economic growth at the expense of environmental protection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Qaadashada waajibaadka ku riixaya marxaladooda horumarineed** - While Hu acknowledges different levels of development, he's arguing *against* being pressured into commitments beyond their capacity, not for taking on more obligations.
*   **B: In diirada la saaro wax soo saarka dhaqaalaha** - He specifically cautions *against* the ""pollute first"" approach which prioritizes economic output above all else.
*   **C: Ka gudubka mas’uuliyadda hadda saaran** - He's advocating for a different approach to development, not shirking responsibility altogether.

The passage specifically states: ""Ma uusan cayimin tirada dhimista, isagoo sheegay in la jaangoyn doono iyadoo lagu saleynayo wax soo saarka dhaqaalaha Shiinaha."" This directly means he didn't mention the *amount* of the reduction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **Aasaaska gaabin:** The passage doesn't discuss a foundation for reduction.
*   **Talooyin ku socda wadamada soo koraya ee ku saabsan wasakhaynta:** He *did* offer advice to developing countries – to avoid ""pollute first, clean up later.""
*   **Taariikhda marka qiiqa kaarboonka la rajaynayo in la dhimi doono:** He stated the goal was to reduce emissions per unit of GDP by 2020, referencing a 2005 baseline."

""Afhayeen u hadlay Medecines Sans Frontiere, Richard Veerman ayaa yidhi: “Angoola waxay kusoo wajahan cudur ka dillaaca kii ugu darnaa xaaladduna aad bay u xuntahay Angoola,” ayuu yidhi.""

Yaa qaban doona doorka Wasiirka Ganacsiga ee dacwooyinka xeer ilaalinta?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

The text states: ""Norman Lamb MP ayaa la filayaa inuu la wareego shaqada Wasiir Davey ayaa tagi doona."" which translates to ""Norman Lamb MP is expected to take over the role of Minister as Davey goes"". This means Lamb will be taking over the ministerial role."
Maxay fanaaniinta masraxa ku dhiirigeliyaan dadwaynaha inay sameeyaan inta lagu jiro showyada Camille Saint-Saens opera?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka qayb qaadashada isticmaalka xashiishadda**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...tiyaatarka laftirkiisana waxa uu ku dhiiri galinaya kasoo qeyb galayaasha in ay kuso biiran cabida."" ( ""...the theater itself encourages attendees to join in the drinking."") and earlier references the actors drinking cannabis. This directly translates to encouraging the audience to participate in cannabis use.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Safar u aadid Jabaan:** While the text mentions Japan as something the characters are obsessed with, it doesn't say the theater encourages the audience to travel there.
*   **C: Ku biiriida ayaga ee masraxa bandhiga:** The text does not suggest audience participation *on stage*.
*   **D: U ogolanshaha in noloshooda lagu tilmaamo waxay jecel yihiin:** This relates to the characters' lives, not something the theater asks of the audience.



"
Yaa ugu horrayn bilaaba cabida duuduubka xashiishka inta lagu jiro showga opera?,"The correct answer is **C: Jilayaasha**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""...kuwa tiyaatarka saaran waxa ay wada cabayaan darogada cannabis..."" which translates to ""...those on stage are all drinking cannabis drugs..."". This directly indicates the actors are the first to consume cannabis during the opera.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fanaanka** - The passage mentions Camille Saint-Saens as the composer, not someone actively drinking on stage.
*   **B: Dadwaynaha Faransiiska ee daawanaya** - The passage says the theatre *encourages* the audience to join, but they aren't the ones starting the consumption.
*   **D: Camille Saint-Saens** - Again, he's the composer, not a participant in the onstage drug use.

"""Waa maxay magaca kale ee """"samo-kusocod"""" ee uu sameeyay Leonov?""","The correct answer is **C: Dhaqdhaqaaqa ka baxsan gaadiidka**.

Here's why:

* The text states Leonov did the first ""EVA"" (extravehicular activity), which is also described as a ""space walk"". ""Dhaqdhaqaaqa ka baxsan gaadiidka"" directly translates to extravehicular activity or a spacewalk.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hawlgalka Apollo-Soyuz:** This was a later mission Leonov *led*, not the name of the first spacewalk.
* **B: Tartanka Hawada:** This is mentioned as something that ended, not a name for the spacewalk.
* **D: Cirbixiyeenka ruushka ee lambar 11:** This is a description of Leonov, not the name of the spacewalk.



"
Leonov howlgalkii soofiyetka qaybtee ayuu ka hogaamiyay?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo–Soyuz**.

The text states: ""Toban sano kadib, wuxuu hogaamiyay hawlgalka Apollo–Isagoo sawiraya in tartanka hawadu dhamaaday."" This directly indicates that Leonov led the Apollo-Soyuz mission."

The text states: ""Gibson waxaa loo qaaday isbitaalka laakiin wuxuu dhintay in yar ka dib."" (Gibson was taken to the hospital but died shortly after.) This means Gibson was injured and unfortunately died as a result of the accident.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Shaqaale garaash ka:** The text mentions someone *near* the garage, but doesn't say they were injured.
*   **C: Carruur:** The text says the children were scared and ran away, but doesn't state they were hurt.
*   **D: Darawal gaari xamuul ah:** The text specifically states the driver was *not* injured."
Maxaa ku dhacay dadkii shilka ku lug lahaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Mid wuu dhaawacmay, midna wuu dhintay**.

Here's why:

* **Gibson** died after being taken to the hospital.
* The **driver** of the truck was not injured.
* The children were frightened and ran away, but it doesn't say they were injured.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuli way dhinteen** - This is incorrect because the driver survived.
* **C: Waa ay qaylinayeen oo ooyeen** - This describes the children's reaction, not what happened *to* them.
* **D: Labaduba dhaawac ayaa soo gaaray** - This is incorrect because Gibson died and the driver was not injured.

The passage explicitly states: ""...aragtidani waxay leedahay maatarka madoow ee gaalagsiyada ku hareeraysan intiisa badani waxay gaalagsiga ugu hareeraysan yihiin qaab balli ah, waxayna ka samaysan yihiin qurubyo aad u yaryar."" This directly refers to the concept of **dark matter** (mugdi), as the text describes it shaping the galaxies and being composed of small particles. The text draws an analogy between the Milky Way's influence on Sagittarius and the moon's influence on Earth, implying the hidden influence of dark matter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Arrin joogta ah** (Constant matter) - While matter is constant, this isn't the specific focus of the research.
*   **B: Xoog ba'an** (Strong force) - The passage doesn't focus on fundamental forces.
*   **C: Qaybaha yaryar** (Small parts) - While the passage mentions ""qurubyo aad u yaryar"", this refers to the *composition* of dark matter, not the overall effect they're studying. The effect *is* related to dark matter (arrin mugdi ah).



"
Saynis yahanadu waxa ay u fiirsadeen arinka kuwa soo socota midkee?,"The correct answer is **B: Dhulka iyo Galaxyada Sagittarius**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly draws a comparison between the effect of the Milky Way on Earth and the effect of the Sagittarius galaxy on Earth. It states, ""Sida dayaxa uu u sameynayo dhulka, taas u dhaw, sida Milky Way u sameyn dhulka Saittarius."" (Just as the moon does to the Earth, similarly the Milky Way does to the Earth of Sagittarius). This indicates that scientists are considering the impact on Earth and the Sagittarius galaxy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dariiq-caanoodka iyo Dayaxa** - While the moon is mentioned in the comparison, ""Dariiq-caanoodka"" (Milky Way) is already part of the comparison.
*   **C: Dhulka iyo Dayaxa** - This is only part of the analogy; the focus is on the larger galactic interaction.
*   **D: Galaxyada Sagittarius iyo Kownka** - The passage doesn't mention the universe (""Kownka"") in the context of this comparison.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaan dhanka muxaafidka laga dhaliilin?","The correct answer is **C: Yaa la siiyay qandaraasyadii dib u dhiska**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Dhaliisha qolyaha laybaraalka ee u ku aaddan dib u dhisku waxay diiradda saartay siinta heshiiska dib u dhiska dad gaar ah oo Reer Washington ah."" This means liberals criticized *who* was receiving the reconstruction contracts - specifically, people from Washington D.C. (implying insiders or connected individuals). The conservative criticism is alluded to as calling it ""The New Confederacy,"" which suggests they were critical of how the money was being used. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kharashgaraynta gargaarka** - The passage doesn't mention conservatives criticizing the cost of the aid itself.
*   **B: Ku dadaal la'aanta dib-u-dhiska** - The passage doesn't state conservatives criticized the effort to rebuild.
*   **D: Kharashgaraynta dib u dhiska** - While cost is a component, the core criticism focused on *who* benefited financially.



"
Yaa dhaleeceynaya qandaraasyada dib u dhiska ee dadaallada gargaarka Duufaanta Katrina?,"The correct answer is **B: Libaraalka**.

The passage states: ""Dhaliisha qolyaha laybaraalka ee u ku aaddan dib u dhisku waxay diiradda saartay siinta heshiiska dib u dhiska dad gaar ah oo Reer Washington ah."" This directly indicates that liberals were criticizing the reconstruction contracts.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, halkee laga arki doonaa nalalka dayax gacmeedka Stardust marka kowad?","The correct answer is **B: Waqooyiga Kaliforniya**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Xiliga marka la joogo 5am (waqtiga bariga) waxaa la filaya in la gelin doona barnaamij muujin guud ahaan dadka waqooyiga California, Oregon, Nevada, iyo Utah."" This means the initial sighting will be in Northern California. 

The text also says: “Waxay u guuri doonta dhanka galbeedka ee waqooyiga California..."" confirming Northern California as the first location to see it.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, dayax gacmeedku wuxuu dhigi doonaa rikoor midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda?","The correct answer is **A: Iftiiminta cirka inta ugu ballaaran**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dayax gacmeedka wuxuu safraya 12.8 km ama 8 maylo sekin kasta, wuxuu u safri kara keliya hal daqiiqo San Francisco ilaa Los Angeles."" And ""Waxay u guuri doonta dhanka galbeedka ee waqooyiga California iyo waxay iftiimin doonta cirka California iyado mareysa bartamaha Oregon iyo Nevada iyo Idaho sidoo kale Utah."" This indicates the meteor will be visible across a very wide area of the sky, setting a record for the longest lasting meteor visible to the public.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ka muuqashada magaalooyinka ugu badan** - While it will be seen in many cities, the text doesn’t state it will be a record for the most cities.
*   **C: Ku soo noqoshada Dhulka sida ugu dhaqsaha badan** - The text says it will be the *longest-lasting* meteor, not the fastest returning.
*   **D: U safrida San Francisco ilaa Los Angeles sida ugu dhaqsaha badan** - The text states it can travel from San Francisco to Los Angeles in one minute, but doesn’t say this is a record.

The text states: ""maydka Saroja Balasubramanian, 53, oo ku daboolan bustayaal dhiig-qaba"" and refers to Dr. Malar Balasubramanian as the one accused of killing her. Therefore, Saroja Balasubramanian was Dr. Balasubramanian's mother."

The text states: ""Halkaas ayayna ka heleen maydka Saroja Balasubramanian, 53, oo ku daboolan bustayaal dhiig-qaba.""  ""Halkaas"" refers to the location of the car, and the body was found *in* the trunk of the car.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sinsinati** - Cincinnati is the city nearby, but the body wasn't found *in* the city itself, but near it.
*   **B: Waddada dhinaceeda** - Dr. Balasubramanian was found by the side of the road, not the body.
*   **D: Magaalada Pittsburgh** - The doctor used to work in Pittsburgh, but the body was found in Ohio, near Cincinnati."
Muxuu la wareegay website ka eBay?,"The correct answer is **C: Iskaybii**.

Here's why:

The passage states eBay *acquired* a company to help it compete in markets where Skype is strong (like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil).  Skype was acquired by Microsoft, and eBay bought a communication software company named **Iskybii** which was positioned as a Skype competitor.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Microsoft** - Microsoft *bought* Skype, not the other way around.
*   **B: Apple** - Apple has no connection to this acquisition.
*   **D: Zoom** - Zoom came to prominence much later and wasn't involved in this acquisition.



"
Muxuu eBay u raadinayaa inay ku guuleysto la wareegida?,"The correct answer is **B: Isku fidinta meelo kaloo cusub**.

The passage explicitly states that eBay hopes to ""diversify its revenue and become popular in areas where Skype is strong, such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil."" This directly relates to expanding into new markets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isku dhafka dakhligeeda:** While increased revenue is a goal, the passage doesn't say this is *why* they are seeking the acquisition.
*   **C: Kor u qaadida sumcadeeda:** The passage doesn't mention anything about improving eBay's reputation.
*   **D: Ku qancinta saamilayda:** This isn't a stated reason for the acquisition."
"Sida lagu xusay qoraalka, yaa aan la falgalin maxaabiista ku hadhay dayrka dagaalka ka bacdi?","The correct answer is **D: Shaqaalaha isbitaalka**.

Here's why:

*   **The text states the injured were taken to the hospital.** However, it doesn't mention any interaction between hospital staff and the prisoners who remained in the yard.
*   **Mediators** *did* attempt to de-escalate the situation.
*   **Emergency responders** (including fire crews) eventually entered the yard.
*   The text doesn't mention any interaction with **officials** directly with the prisoners in the yard before the fire.

Therefore, the only group explicitly *not* mentioned as engaging with the prisoners in the yard is the hospital staff."
Maxaa ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo ugu dambeyntii sababay in maxaabiista ay ka laabtaan rabshadda?,"The correct answer is **B: Sunta ilmada**.

Here's why:

The text states that ""askarta ku diyaar garoobeen waxayna ku galeen beerta waxayna ku tureen maxaabiistii sunta dadka ka ilmeysiso."" This directly indicates that the tear gas was used *on* the prisoners, and led them to change their behavior (presumably to escape the irritation).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wada xaajoodyo lagu guulaystay** - The text says mediators *tried* to calm the situation, but the prisoners' needs weren't clear, indicating no successful negotiations.
*   **C: Maxaabiistii kale oo dhaawacantay** - While the prisoners were initially taken to the hospital for injuries, this doesn't explain why they stopped the riot later.
*   **D: Dab** - The fire was *used on* the prisoners, it didn't cause them to stop the riot, the tear gas did. Also, the firemen made the fire worse.

"Fikirka Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, maxay tahay in dalka Iran uu iska xoreeyo?","The correct answer is **D: Ku tiirsanaanta saliidda**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ayaa tilmaamay ku tiirsanaanta saliida ay tahay “dabin” kasoo bilaabato kacdoonka Islaamiga ee Iran ee 1979 kaasoo ay haboon tahay inuu wadanka iska xoreeyo.""  This directly translates to him believing Iran should free itself from reliance on oil.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Xayiraadaha maaliyadeed:** While the passage mentions sanctions, Khamenei isn't saying Iran needs to free itself *from* the sanctions, but from its economic dependence on oil despite the sanctions.
*   **B: Kacaankii Islaamka:** He references the Islamic Revolution, but doesn’t say Iran needs to free itself *from* it.
*   **C: Dakhliga dibadda:**  He mentions dependence on foreign income, specifically from oil, but the focus is on the *reliance on the source* of that income, not the income itself.



"
"Sida lagu xusay qoraalka, yaa qirtay saamaynta ay u gaysatay cunaqabatayntu dhaqaalaha Iran?","The correct answer is **A: Ilo sare**.

The text states: ""Faallooyinka, oo toos uga socda talafeeshinku, waa markii ugu horeysay ee ilo madaxda sare ee Iiraan ka socda qirtaan in cunaqabataynadu wax saameyn ah yeesheen."" This translates to ""Comments, live on television, were the first time sources from high-ranking officials in Iran admitted that the sanctions had an impact.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: OPEC** - OPEC reported a decrease in oil production, but didn't *admit* the sanctions caused it.
*   **C: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei** - He talked about reliance on oil being a ""weakness"", but didn't directly admit the sanctions were causing problems.
*   **D: Midowga Yurub** - The European Union *imposed* the sanctions, they didn't *admit* their impact from an Iranian source.



"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan ka mid ahayn habka codbixinta ee Faransiiska?,"The correct answer is **D: Codadka waxa tirinaya wakiilada musharixiinta**.

Here's why:

The passage states that codadka (votes) are counted by *mutadawiciin* (volunteers) under close supervision. It doesn't mention candidates' representatives doing the counting themselves.

Let's look at why the other options *are* part of the French voting process as described:

*   **A: Sanduuqyada cod bixinta ee hufan (Transparent ballot boxes):** The passage specifically mentions the need for ballot boxes without secrecy to prevent fraud.
*   **B: Wakiilo ay soo direen musharaxiintu (Representatives sent by candidates):** The text states candidates *can* send representatives to witness each part of the operation.
*   **C: Saxeexa liiska cod bixinta (Signing the voting list):** Voters sign the ballot paper after it is validated, as indicated in the passage.

Therefore, only option D is not mentioned as being part of the French voting process in the provided text."
Halkee ayay codbixiyeyaashu ku tilmaamayaan musharaxa ay doorteen?,"The correct answer is **B: Warqad hore loo daabacay dusheeda**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""codeeyuhu qolyar buu galaa, waraaq hore loo sii daabacay ayuu ku muujiyaa musharaxa uu rabo kuna ridaa gal..."" This directly translates to the voter indicating their choice *on the pre-printed paper* by marking it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Liiska codbixinta dushiisa:** The text doesn't mention a list of candidates.
*   **C: Baqshad dusheeda:** The voter puts the ballot *into* the envelope, they don't mark their choice on it.
*   **D: Mashiin ku dhex jira qolka:** The process described is entirely manual; there is no mention of a machine."
Maxaa ku kalifay Allen inuu bilaabo raadinta siddeed sano ah oo uu Musashi raadinayo?,"The correct answer is **C: Maalgelinta uu ku sameeyay sahaminta badda**.

Here's why:

The text states that Allen ""ku maalgeliyey inta ugu badan hantidiisa sahaminta Badda"" (invested much of his wealth in ocean exploration) and ""ku bilaabay hawlgalkiisa inuu Musashi ka soo helo dagaal waqti dheeraaday."" (started his operation to find the Musashi, a long-awaited battle). This implies his existing investment and interest in ocean exploration fueled his search for the Musashi.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maalkiisa** (His wealth) - While he *used* his wealth, that's not the driving *reason* he started the search.
*   **B: Xiisaha uu u qabo khariidaynta gunta badda** (His interest in mapping the ocean floor) - The text mentions the ocean floor being explored, but doesn't say this was his initial motivation.
*   **D: Danihiisa dagaalka** (His war interests) - The text says it was a ""long-awaited battle"" meaning it was significant, but doesn't imply he had personal war interests."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, muxuu Allen ku bixiyay lacag aad u badan?","The correct answer is **B: Sahminta badda**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Allen ayaa la sheegay inuu ku maalgeliyey inta ugu badan hantidiisa **sahaminta Badda** wuxuuna ku bilaabay hawlgalkiisa inuu Musashi ka soo helo dagaal waqti dheeraaday."" 

While the recovery of the Musashi was *part* of his sea exploration, the text says he invested most of his fortune in sea exploration *generally*.

*   In aan la cabin biyaha tubada/qasabada

""Gudaha ku jir"" ma ahan mid ka mid ah talooyinka la soo jeediyay."
"Sida uu qabo Dr. Moll, waa maxay waxa ugu badan ee khuseeya XDR-TB?","The correct answer is **B: Kala duwanaanshiyaha iska caabbinta daawooyinka**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states Dr. Moll identified a new variant with ""increased drug resistance.""** He directly points to this as a major concern (""high level of risk"").  The term XDR-TB itself stands for Extremely Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis, so drug resistance is the defining characteristic.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Beddelka waxa qandaraas lagu qaadanayaa isbitaalka:** While the text mentions potential hospital-acquired cases, this is a *result* of the problem, not the problem itself. Dr. Moll is more worried about *why* it's spreading easily.
* **C: Qadarka dadka uu qof cudurku qaadsiin karo:** The text mentions the rate of transmission (10-15 contacts), but Dr. Moll's primary concern is the drug resistance making it harder to *treat* those infected.
* **D: Heerkeda dhimashadu waa sarraysaa:** The text doesn't mention mortality rates. While XDR-TB is serious, the immediate concern raised by Dr. Moll is the resistance to treatment.



"
Immisa bukaan oo uu ku dhacay kala duwanaanshaha cusub ayaa la xaqiijiyay inay yihiin shaqaale daryeel caafimaad?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The passage states: ""...ugu yaraa laba ka mid ah waxay ahaayeen shaqaalaha caafimaadka ee cusbitaalka."" This directly translates to ""at least two of them were hospital healthcare workers."""
Maxay tahay nooca tignoolajiyada uu isticmaalo nidaamka NextGen?,"The correct answer is **A: Tignoolajiyad ku salaysan dayax-gacmeedka**.

The passage specifically states that NextGen ""isticmaalaa satalayd ku shaqeeya tignolajiyadda kaasi oo kasoo horjeeda raadaalada gaboobay ee dhulka."" This directly translates to technology based on satellites (dayax-gacmeedka).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tignoolajiyad tafatiran** - The passage doesn't mention sophisticated technology in general, only the specific type.
* **C: Tignoolajiyad raadaarka-dhulka ku salaysan** - The passage explicitly states NextGen is *replacing* this older technology.
* **D: Tignoolajiyad ku salaysan sii daynta karbonka** - This is irrelevant to the description of NextGen.



"
Sidee bay NextGen si toos ah uga faa'iidaysanaysaa maamulayaashsa taraafikada hawada?,"The correct answer is **A: Jidadka duulimaadka ee gaagaaban**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that NextGen ""facilitates aircraft to fly shorter routes."" This directly benefits air traffic controllers by allowing them to guide planes along more efficient paths.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Goobo diyaaradeed oo aad u tafatiran:** While NextGen improves accuracy, the passage doesn't focus on *more* landing spots, but on how planes travel *between* them.
*   **C: Sii daynta kaarboonka oo is dhintay:** This is a *result* of NextGen (reduced fuel use means less carbon emissions), not how it directly helps controllers.
*   **D: Shidaal yar:** Again, this is a consequence of NextGen, not a direct benefit to air traffic controllers."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaysan taariikhyahanadu aysan ku dhaleecaynin FBI-da inay diiradda saaraan?","The correct answer is **A: Kor u qaadista heerkooda guusha**.

Here's why:

The text states that historians criticized the FBI for prioritizing cases to *increase their success rates*. The question asks what they *didn't* criticize the FBI for focusing on.  The other options are all specifically mentioned as areas of concern:

*   **B:** The FBI is criticized for focusing on easy-to-solve cases (like car thefts).
*   **C:** The text directly mentions the FBI shifting focus *away* from child exploitation cases due to funding cuts, which implies they were previously focusing on them.
*   **D:** Car thefts are specifically mentioned as a type of case the FBI is prioritizing inappropriately.

Therefore, the historians' criticism wasn't about the *goal* of increasing success rates, but about *how* the FBI was achieving it (by focusing on easier cases)."
Maxay ka hortaga-fisqigu ku khasabtay FBI da inay samayso?,"The correct answer is **B: Kobcinta heerka guusha ee wakaalada**.

Here's why:

The passage states the FBI was pressured to increase its success rates. This pressure, stemming from Congressional funding cuts, led to prioritizing easier cases (like car thefts) to inflate those numbers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the FBI *did* shift focus, the passage doesn't state they divided resources *specifically* towards car theft cases.
*   **C:** Focusing on easily solved crimes was a *result* of the pressure, not the pressure itself.
*   **D:** The passage specifically states the cuts forced the FBI to *reduce* the number of agents working on pornography cases.

Maxaa ku dhacay baabuurka dab-damiska ee ka jawaab ceshay shilka burburka diyaaradii dagaal ee JAS 39C Gripen? ,"The correct answer is **A: Way burburtay**.

The text states: ""Warbixinada deegaaneed ayaa sheegaayo in baabuurka dab damiska garoonka diyaarada uu **gadoomay** intuu u socday meesha.""  ""Gadoomay"" translates to ""broke down"" or ""was damaged,"" and in this context, suggests it was destroyed or rendered unusable. While the other options aren't impossible, ""burburtay"" (broke down/destroyed) is the most direct and accurate translation of the provided information."
"shilkii burburkii diyaarada dagaal ee JAS 39C Gripen, garoonka waxaa laga xiray kuwee?","The correct answer is **A: Duulimaadyada ganacsiga**.

The text explicitly states: ""...taa soo madaarka ka xirtay duulimaadada ganacsiga."" (which translates to ""...which closed the airport to commercial flights."")



"
yuu Brzezinski u fidiyay hagis intii lagu jiray Kacaankii Iran?,"The correct answer is **C: Karter**.

The text states: ""asagoo ku xige Henry Kissinger... iyo soofiyeeti. Duulaan lagu qaaday afgaanistan 1979."" It further says he *assisted Carter* in managing world affairs, including the Iranian revolution of 1979.  This means he advised Carter during the Iranian revolution.



"
Yaa hayay xilka La-taliyaha Amniga Qaranka illaa 1977-kii?,"The correct answer is **B: Kissinger**.

The text states Brzezinski was NSA *from* 1977 to 1981 *succeeding* Henry Kissinger. This means Kissinger held the position before Brzezinski."
Midkee kuwan soo socda aanan si sax ah uga tarjumeynin hayaan-xirfadeedka Bobek ee Partizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **A: Wuxuu dhaliyay in ka badan 468 gool intii uu u ciyaarayay kooxda**.

Here's why:

The text states Bobek scored 403 goals in 468 games. Option A says he scored *more than* 468 goals, which is incorrect based on the provided information.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: Wuxuu dhaliyay goolal ka badan ciyaaryahan kasta oo kale** - The text states ""Qof kaleeto uma dheelin inta cayaar ama madhalinin inta gool ee uu kooxda u dhaliye Bobek,"" meaning he outscored everyone.
* **C: Wuxu ahaa mid mar loo doortay ciyaaryahanka ugu wanaagsan taariikhda kooxda** -  The text says he was voted the best player in Partizan's history in 1995.
* **D: Wuxuu kasoo muuqday ciyaaro ka badan ciyaaryahan kasta oo kale** - The text states he played 468 games, and nobody played more.



"
Weedhee ku saabsan taariikhda Bobek ee Partizan Belgrade ayaa run ah?,"The correct answer is **A: Wuxuu bilaabay inuu u dheelo Partizan 1945**

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states: ""Wuxuu ku biirey sanadkii 1945 wuxuuna joogay ilaa sanadkii 1958."" (He joined in 1945 and stayed until 1958).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Wuxuu u dheelay Zagrep ka hor Partizan Balgrade** - The text says he was *born* in Zagreb, not that he played for a team there.
*   **C: Wuxuu u dheelay Partizan ilaa 1995** - He played until 1958, not 1995. 1995 is when he was *voted* as the best player.
*   **D: Wuxuu helay caanimo kadib markii loogu codeeyay ciyaariyahanka ugu fiican ee Partizan** - He gained fame *during* his playing career (scoring a record number of goals), the 1995 vote was a recognition of that existing fame."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, sifadee bay Heperonychus ay kaga duwan yihiin Velociraptor?","The correct answer is **B: Waxay leedahay cidi labaad oo ka sii weyn**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Ciddidiisa labaad ayaa wayn, taasoo keentay magaca Hesperonychus taasoo la macno ah """"ciddi galbeedeed."""" "" (Its second claw is large, which led to the name Hesperonychus which means ""western claw."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waxay leedahay labo lugood** - The text says it walked on two legs *like* Velociraptor, meaning Velociraptor also has two legs.
*   **C: Waxay leedahay jidh dhamaan baalal ku dahaaran** - The text says it was ""si buuxda baalasha u leh"", meaning it had feathers, not that its *entire* body was covered in them.
*   **D: Waa kuwo dhiiga diiran leh** - The text states it was ""dhiiga diiran leh"" *like* Velociraptor, so this isn't a difference.



"
Micnaha “Hesperonychus” sifada jireed ee noocee ah baa laga soo xigtay?,"The correct answer is **A: Ciddiyaha**.

The text states: ""Ciddidiisa labaad ayaa wayn, taasoo keentay magaca Hesperonychus taasoo la macno ah """"ciddi galbeedeed."""""". This directly links the name ""Hesperonychus"" to its claws, specifically the large second claw."

Weedhee ayaa sax ah oo ku saabsan dhacdada ay toogashadu ka dhacday?,"The correct answer is **A: Waxay ka dhacday munaasabad sannad-guurada ee Buffalo**.

Here's why:

* The text specifically states the shooting occurred while the couple was in Buffalo celebrating their first anniversary with friends and family.
* Option B is incorrect because the event isn't described as ""official"".
* Option C is incorrect because the event happened in Buffalo, not Texas.
* Option D is incorrect because it was their anniversary celebration, not their wedding.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxay ahayd waxa ay wadnaha farta ugu hayeen masuuliyiintu ee ku saabsan Luno?","The correct answer is **C: Daadashada shidaalka**.

Here's why:

The text states the captain ""feared a spill of oil."" This directly indicates that the potential for an oil spill was the primary concern (what was ""keeping their hearts in their throats"") regarding the Luno after it broke apart.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shixnad bacrimin la'aaneed (Unloaded consignment):** The text doesn't mention any concerns about an unloaded consignment.
*   **B: Mowjado iyo dabaylo badan (Strong waves and winds):** While waves and winds *caused* the problem, they weren't the thing the captain was actively fearing *would happen* as a result.
*   **D: Dhaawacyo suurtagal ah oo soo gaari kara xubnaha markabka (Possible injuries to crew members):** The text states the crew was rescued with only one minor injury, so this wasn't the primary worry.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, keebaa weedhaha soo socda ee ku saabsan burburka Luno aan run ahayn?","The correct answer is **B: Markabka ayaa xiliga uu burburay waxaa saarnaa 100 mitir oo shidaal ah.**

Here's why:

*   **The text states:** Luno waxa saarnaa 120-160 mitir oo saddex jibaaran oo shidaal ah markuu jabay (Luno was carrying 120-160 meters of three times refined fuel when it broke).
*   This contradicts option B, which claims the ship was carrying 100 meters of fuel at the time of the break.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: Burburku wuxuu dhacay ka hor inta aan la qaadin shixnada** (The break happened before the shipment was loaded): The text states the ship was *on its way to pick up its first load* meaning it hadn't loaded cargo yet when it broke.
*   **C: Marka la isku geeyo labo iyo toban shaqaalaha markabka ahaa, hal mid ayaa ka dhaawacmay** (Out of the twelve crew members, one was injured): The text clearly says *shaqaalihii 12 ka ahaa dhaawaca qura ee dhacayna waxa uu ahaa san jabay* (of the 12 crew members, the only injury was a broken bone).
*   **D: Markabka ayaa lagu soo riixay dhanka dhagaxda biyo-jabka** (The ship was pushed towards the reef): The text mentions *dabaylo xooggan iyo mawjado ayaa ku riixay moos-biyoodka* (strong winds and waves pushed it onto the reef).

Tobankee sano ayay aljeeriya qaadatay xorinimada?,"The correct answer is **C: 1960-yadii**.

Here's why:

The passage states Vautier returned to Algeria in the **1960s** *after* it had ""recently gained independence."" This directly implies Algeria gained its independence in the 1960s. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 1940-yadii** - The passage mentions Vautier's involvement in the French Resistance during WWII in the 1940s, but this doesn't relate to Algeria's independence.
*   **B: 1950-yadii** - While there was likely struggle for independence in the 1950s, the passage explicitly states he returns *after* independence is achieved.
*   **D: 1970-yadii** - The passage mentions a connection to 1973, but that's related to his political views, not when Algeria gained independence."
Halkee ayaanan la dhigin shaashadaha telefishinka marka lagu jiro munaasabada janaasada?,"The correct answer is **D: Fagaaraha St. Peter**.

Here's why:

The passage states that *many* large televisions were set up in *various locations* in the city of Rome, and similar setups were made in other cities like Poland. It also explicitly mentions that St. Peter's Square was *so crowded* that people couldn't all participate in the mourning. This implies televisions were *not* set up *in* St. Peter's Square itself, but around the city to accommodate those who couldn't fit in the square.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Magaalada Rome oo dhan** - The passage says televisions *were* set up in various places *in* Rome.
*   **B: Magaalooyinka kala duwan ee talyaaniga** - Televisions *were* set up in different cities in Italy.
*   **C: Meelo gaar ah ee Poland** - Televisions *were* set up in Poland, but the question asks where they were *not* set up during the funeral.



"
Halkee lagu qabtay munaasabadii aaska?,"The correct answer is **C: Fagaaraha St. Peter**.

The text specifically states: ""Dadka joogay tacsida St Peter's Square ayaa aad u badnaa..."" This directly indicates the event took place at St. Peter's Square.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Meelo kala du duwan ee dhamaan Rome:** While screens were set up in various locations *to view* the funeral, the main event and gathering was at St. Peter's Square.
*   **B: Poland:** The text mentions Poland as a place where similar visuals were shown, but the event itself was not held there.
*   **D: Marka kowaad Rome, kadib magaalooyinka kale ee Talyaaniga:** The funeral began in Rome, but the other cities were places where people *watched* it, not where it was held.

"Qaraxa kadib, yaa laga daaweeyay dhaawacyo halisa?","The correct answer is **A: Ugu yaraan shan qof** (At least five people).

The passage states: ""ku dhawaad shan ruux oo goobta ku sugnaa marka uu qaraxa dhacay ayaa laga daaweyay shoog"" which translates to ""almost five people who were at the scene when the explosion occurred were treated for shock.""  While it doesn't specify *serious* injuries, it says they were treated.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Cidna** - The passage directly states that people were treated.
*   **C: Masuulka shirkad gaas** - The passage doesn't mention the gas company official being injured.
*   **D: Daris** - The neighbor *reported* the leak, but wasn't mentioned as being injured."
Yaa soo sheegay in gaasku hoos ka daadanayay?,"The correct answer is **A: Dariska isla dhismaha** (A neighbor in the building).

The passage states: ""...ka dib markii qof deriskaa soo sheegay in gaas liidayso."" This translates to ""...after a neighbor reported a gas leak.""
"
"Sida lagu xusay qoraalka, imisa qof ayaa ku dhintay weerarka?","The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The text states ""Maydadku Waxay kala ahaayeen Nicholas Alden, 25, iyo Zachary Cuddebak,21."" This directly translates to ""The dead were Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21.""  Therefore, two people died in the attack.

The injuries to Veguilla and Schneider, while severe, do *not* indicate they died. The fifth person mentioned is only relevant to the gun jamming incident, not death."
Yaa hubkiisu ku fashilmay inuu rasaas rido ilaa xad inta weerarku socday?,"The correct answer is **B: Uka**.

The text states: ""Qoriga Uka ayaa is jaam gareeyo asagoo ku haayo ninka shanaad madaxiisa."" This directly translates to ""Uka's gun jammed while holding it to the fifth man's head,"" meaning the gun failed to fire.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **Cuddeback:** Was the driver, and there's no mention of his gun malfunctioning.
*   **Schneider:** Was injured and received reconstructive surgery, but not involved with a malfunctioning gun.
*   **Alden:** Is only mentioned as one of the perpetrators, with no details about a weapon."
Ciyaarahaan soo socda keebaa loo codeeyay in laga saaro barnaamijka Olimbikada?,"The correct answer is **A: Squash**.

The text states that squash is *trying* to get into the Olympics, alongside karate and others. It also mentions baseball and softball were previously voted *out* of the Olympics in 2005. Rugby and golf are being voted *in*. This implies squash is currently not an Olympic sport and is vying for inclusion. 

Therefore, squash isn't being removed, it's hoping to be added. The text doesn't mention any current sports being removed, just those trying to get in. However, since baseball and softball were previously voted out, and the question is asking which sport is being removed, the best answer, though indirectly stated, is Squash."
Ciyaarahaan soo socda keebaa Gudida Olimbikada u codaysay si loogu daro ciyaaraha?,"The correct answer is **C: Rugby union**.

The text specifically states: ""Rugby, **khaasatan midawga rugby**... ayaa u codeeyay in lagusoo daro ciyaaraha olombikada."" This translates to ""Rugby, **especially rugby union**, was voting to be included in the Olympic games.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rollersports:** This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **B: Kubadda Baseball:** The text mentions baseball and softball were *previously* voted on in 2005, but it doesn't say they are currently being considered.
*   **D: Softball:** Same as baseball – a previous consideration, not a current one.

The passage states Arthur Guinness signed a lease for **9,000 years** at St. James' Gate Brewery. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 250** is the number of years *later* that Guinness became a global business.
*   **B: 10** is not mentioned in the text as the lease duration.
*   **C: 1759** is the year the lease was signed, not the length of the lease.



"
Ilaa imisa bilyan bay soo saartaa Guinnes sanadkii?,"The correct answer is **D: 10**.

The text states Guinness makes ""more than 10 billion euros (US$14.7 billion) each year."""
Ilaa Imisa waddan oo ka tirsan Midowga Yurub ayaa laga helay fayraska H5N1?,"The correct answer is **C: Todobo**.

The text states: ""Faransiiska waa waddanki toddobaad ee ka mid ah Midowga Yurub ee uu silciyo fayraskan; Waxaa ka horeeyay Ostiriya, Jarmalka, Islofeniya, Bulgariya, Giriirga iyo Talyaaniga.""  This directly translates to ""France is the seventh country in the European Union to be affected by this virus; preceded by Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece and Italy."""
Halkee bay ahayd meeshii kiiska fayraska H5N1 ee ugu dambeeyay laga helay?,"The correct answer is **A: Faransiiska** (France).

The text states: ""...la xaqiijiyay inuu ku dhacay duurjoog dhimatay, tasoo laga helay isniintii,maarshlaan oo u dhaw lyon oo ku taal **bariga Faransiiska**."" This directly indicates that the latest case was found in France."
Goorma ayay ahayd markii ugu dambaysay ee Haiti ay la kulanto cudurka ka hor inta aysan faafitaanka sababin nabad ilaaliyayaashu?,"The correct answer is **A: 1800kii**.

The passage states: ""Inta ay imaanin ciidamadaasi, Haiti ayaa arkin dhibaatooyin la xiriiro xanuunkaasi sanadaha 1800 ka dib."" This means the last time Haiti experienced issues with the disease was in the 1800s.



"
Qashin halkee ka yimid ayaa ka qayb qaatay faafitaanka cudurka?,"The correct answer is **B: Xerada Qaramada Midoobay**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""qashinka laga keenay xerada QM si sax ah looma basrin, taasbaana keentay in bakteeriyo gasho gacamada webiga Artibonite"". This directly links the waste from the UN camp to the spread of the disease.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wabiga Artibonite:** The river *received* the contamination, it didn't *originate* it.
*   **C: Goobtii uu ka dhacay dhulgariirkii 2010-kii:** The earthquake is mentioned as the reason the peacekeepers came to Haiti, but not as the source of the cholera.
*   **D: Machadka Cadaalada iyo Dimuqraadiyadda ee Haiti:** This institute conducted research, but didn't contribute to the spread of the disease.



"
Maxay dowlada Irishka ay qorshaynaysaa inay samayso?,"The correct answer is **B: Soo bandhigga sharciyo aad u adag oo ku saabsan ogolaanshaha daroogada.**

Here's why:

The text states the Irish government is ""strengthening the importance of parliamentary legality"" regarding this matter and that a spokesperson emphasized the importance of public health and a criminal justice perspective for ""passing legislation as quickly as possible.""  The minister also expressed concern about people benefiting from temporary allowances for drugs.  This all points towards creating stricter, legally-backed laws regarding drug allowances, not removing criminal penalties or decriminalizing drugs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku wareejinta xukunnada dembiilayaasha daroogada** - The text doesn't mention changing sentences for drug offenders.
*   **C: Khafiifinta sharciyada ku saabsan ogolaanshaha daroogada** - The government is doing the opposite – *strengthening* the legal framework.
*   **D: Ka dhigista daroogada wax aan danbi lahayn** - This is a radical shift not supported by the text, which focuses on legal regulation.



"
Maxaa si ku meel gaar ah sharci uga ahaa dalka Ireland?,"The correct answer is **D: Daroogada (Drugs)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""ogolaanshaha ku meel-gaarka ah ee daroogooyinka la xiriira"" (temporary approval of drugs) and concerns about ""danbiyada daroogada la xiriiray"" (drug-related crimes). This clearly indicates that the temporary law related to drugs. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dhaca (Fall)** - The passage doesn't discuss falls.
*   **B: Wax isdaba marinta (Postponement)** - While the law is changing, the initial issue wasn't a postponement of something.
*   **C: Xadgudubka (Abuse)** - While drug abuse is a related issue, the text focuses on the legal status of drugs themselves.



"
Maxay tahay waxa looga shakisan yahay dembiilaha oo wali loo baarayaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Kharribaad**.

The passage states the suspect is being investigated for ""ku xad gudub ma ahan kharibaad"" which translates to ""not a simple vandalism"". This directly indicates that vandalism is what they are investigating."
"Markii la beddelayay calaamadda, muxuu tuhmanuhu samayn waayay?","The correct answer is **C: Jir ahaan u waxyeeleeyay**.

Here's why:

The passage states the markings were *not* physically damaged. Instead, they were altered with black paint to change a letter ""O"" into a lowercase ""e"".  This means the perpetrator *didn't* physically harm or damage the signs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Beddelida mid kamida xarfihiisa** - The passage clearly states a letter *was* changed.
*   **B: Ku qurxiyay calaamadda nabadeed** - The passage mentions a peace sign was *used* in the alteration, not that it was simply added.
*   **D: Isticmaalka suuf-adag si wax uga beddelo** - The passage specifically states ""qad madow"" (black paint) was used, not a marker.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, midkee ayaa ka mid ah kuwan soo socda ee aan lagu eedayn macalinkii luuqada Ingriiska ee Karno?","The correct answer is **B: Shukaansiga ardayda**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Arday hore wax uga bartay ayaa sheegay inuu 'af suuq fasalka kaga hadli jiray, **shukaansiga uu ardayda u dhigi jiray, oo ardayda saaxiibkood uun ahaa.**'"" This is a *report* of what a former student *claimed*, but the text doesn't state Karno was *accused* of this practice by Modern Education or King's Glory. It's a student's allegation.

The text explicitly states Karno was accused of:

*   **A: Ku xadgudubka xuquuqda daabacaadda** (""Waxaa sidoo kale horaan lagu eedeeyay ku xad gudubka xuquuqda daabacaadda"")
*   **C: Daabacaadda xayaysiisyada aan la fasaxin** (""Waxbarashada Casriga ah ayaa ku eedaysay inuu xayaysiino waawayn ku daabacay basaska isagoon ogolaansho u haysan"")
*   **D: Isticmaalka luqadda aan haboonayn fasalka dhexdiisa** (""Qoraalkiisa ayaa ku dhex adeegsaday ereyo ay waalidiinta qaar u arkayeen inay yihiin kuwa qallafsan, oo sida la sheegay ayaa adeegsaday fasalka ku dhex adeegsaday caytin."")



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, Rolando Mendoza yuusan afduubasho ku kaxaysan?","The correct answer is **A: Dalxiisyal** (Tourists).

The text states: ""Nin hore uga tirsanaa booliiska Filipino ayaa afduubay **dalxiisayaasha** Hong Kong..."" (A former Filipino police officer kidnapped **tourists** from Hong Kong...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: boolis ka** (police officer): Mendoza *was* a police officer, but he didn't kidnap other police officers.
*   **C: Carruur** (children): Children were *among* those kidnapped, but they weren't the only ones, and Mendoza didn't specifically target children to kidnap.
*   **D: Sawir qaadayaal** (photographers): The Filipino photographers were initially taken hostage, but were later released and did not continue being held.



"
"Iyadoo lagu salaynayo qoraalka, yaa kamida la haystayaasha aan la xaqiijin in xili hore la sii daayay?","The correct answer is **A: Dalxiisayasha**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Lix lahayste, oo ay ku jiraan caruur iyo dad waawayn, ayaa horeyba laga soo daayay"". The 'lahayste' are the hostages, and these hostages include tourists. The question asks who were among those released early, and the text specifically states tourists were part of that group.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Waayeelka** - The text mentions an elderly woman needing the bathroom *after* the photographers were released, implying she wasn't in the initial group released.
* **C: Sawir qaadyaasha** - The text clearly states the Filipino photographers *were* released.
* **D: Caruurta** - While children *were* among those released, the question asks for those who were part of the larger group of hostages (dalxiisayaasha/tourists).



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, yaa ururinaya saxeexyada taageeraya sharciyeynta guurka isku jinsiga ah ee Brazil?","The correct answer is **A: Mudaaharaadayaasha** (Demonstrators).

The text explicitly states: ""Mudaharaadayaashu waxay rejaynayaan inay soo uruuriyaan 1.2 malyan oo saxiix si ay u hor dhigaan Koonagreeska Noofeembar."" This directly indicates that the demonstrators are the ones collecting the signatures.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Roberto Jefferson:** He is currently holding the bill but not collecting signatures.
*   **C: Kaniisadda Roman Catholic:** The text states the Catholic Church *opposes* same-sex marriage.
*   **D: Marta Suplicy:** She originally wrote the bill, but it has been modified and passed on to Roberto Jefferson, and the text doesn't mention her collecting signatures now."
Mudaaharaadayaashu yay siin doonaan arjigooda?,"The correct answer is **C: Golaha Qaranka ee Brazil (National Congress of Brazil)**.

Here's why:

The text states that protestors hope to gather 1.2 million signatures to present to Congress in November. This indicates they are aiming to influence the legislative body to pass the bill.



"
"Sida laga soo xigtay Armand Versace, maxaa si toos ah u dhacay ka hor inta aysan dadku bilaabin inay ka falceliyaan cimilada?","The correct answer is **C: Waxaa jiray dabaylo culus**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shan daqiiqo oo lagu soo muujiyey murayad waxaa bilaabtay dhaqdhaqaqa dabeesha, ilaa daqiiqad ka bacdi, dabeesha waxay bilaabtay iney jarto xawaare 70km saacadiii ah..."" This directly translates to ""After five minutes displayed on the mirror, the movement of the wind began, and after a minute, the wind began to cut at 70km per hour.""  This describes strong winds (dabeesha) beginning *before* the rain and snow and people's reactions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waxay bilowday in ay hoorto** (It began to rain) - The rain came *after* the wind, and after people began to react.
*   **B: Bandhigu wuxuu dib u dhacay shan daqiiqo** (The show was delayed five minutes) - This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Waxuu waayay gabi ahaan raadka qof qoyska kamida** (He completely lost track of a family member) - This happened *during* the chaos, not before it began.



"
"Sida laga soo xigtay Versace, goormay dabaylaha ugu xoogga badani bilowdeen?","The correct answer is **A: Waxooga daqiiqada ka dib markii bandhiggu bilaabmay**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Shan daqiiqo oo lagu soo muujiyey murayad waxaa bilaabtay dhaqdhaqaqa dabeesha, **ilaa daqiiqad ka bacdi**, dabeesha waxay bilaabtay iney jarto xawaare 70km saacadiii ah..."" 

This clearly indicates the strongest winds began *a minute* after the display started. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Roobka ka dib** - The winds started *before* the heavy rain.
*   **C: Markii uu waayay walaashiis** - Losing his sister happened later in the sequence of events.
*   **D: Inta aysan hoorin ka hor** - The winds started *after* the display began, not before it.



"
"ka hor Fred, immisa duufaanno oo waaweyn ayaa laga diiwaan geliyay bariga 35°W?","The correct answer is **C: Labo**.

The text states that Fred is the *third* largest storm ever recorded in the east Atlantic 35°W. This means there were two storms larger than Fred before him.
"
"Markii uu Fred uu ku sugnaa meel u dhow jasiiradaha Cape Verde, jihadee ayay ahayd mid u socotay?","The correct answer is **D: Waqooyi-galbeed**.

The text states: ""Fred waa duufaantii ugu xooga badneyd ee weligeed laga diiwaamiyay koonfurta iyo bariga tan iyo markii la bilaabay sawirka dayax gacmeedka, waana duufaanta saddexaad ee ugu weyneyd ee riroorka bariga 35°W."" and ""Fred hadda wuxuu leeyahay baadad uu ku duulo 105 mayl saacadiiba (165Km/h) wuxuuna u socda dhanka waqooyi.""

This means it originated from the south and east, and is *currently* moving north, but its initial direction from Cape Verde was north-west as it came *from* the west. The text doesn't directly state the initial direction, but it is implied given its origin and current path.



"
Kuwan soo socda kee baa xawaarihiisu uu ka dheereeya kuwii ka horreeyay?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The text explicitly states: ""Xawaaraha 802.11n ayaa si weyn uuga dheereya midkii ka horeeye oo lahaa ugu badnaan soo saarid 600Mbit/s gabi ahaanba."" This means 802.11n is faster than the previous standards.
"
Maxaa lagama maarmaan u ah 802.11n si uu u noqdo mid waafaqsan kuwii ka horeeyay 802.11b?,"The correct answer is **D: raadyo laba jibbaaran**.

Here's why:

The text states that 802.11n needs a base station with *two radios* to be backwards compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g. This is because it operates on both 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz simultaneously, needing a separate radio for each frequency band to communicate with older standards.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Xawaare aad u dheereeya:** While 802.11n *has* a higher speed, this isn't what *enables* backwards compatibility.
*   **B: Awoodda 802.11b uu u leeyahay inuu ku shaqeeyo 5.0Ghz:** 802.11b does *not* operate on 5.0Ghz; it uses 2.4Ghz.
*   **C: Xawaare-qaad ee 600 Mbps:** This is the *result* of 802.11n's capabilities, not the requirement for backwards compatibility.



"
Immisa munaasabadood ayaa loo qorsheeyay in ku guulaystaha billada dahabka Olombikada uu ku dabaasho ciyaaraha Barwaaqo-sooranka?,"The correct answer is **B: Sadex**.

The text states ""...seddex relays oo ah ciyaarihi Barwaqa soranka..."" which translates to ""...three relays of the Paralympic games..."". It also mentions the 100m and 200m races. Therefore, the total number of events where he was aiming for a gold medal is 100m + 200m + 3 relays = 5. However, the question specifically asks about the *relays* in the Paralympic games. The text clearly states **three** relays.

Therefore, the answer is **B**."
Maxay buu ku guulaystaha billada dahabka ah ee Olimbikada uu xanuunkiisa daawo ugu qaadan waayay?,"The correct answer is **D: Lagama ogola dhanka Ciyaaraha Barwaaqo-sooranka** (They were not allowed by the rules of the Olympics).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states he couldn't take the necessary medication ""maadaama ay mamnuuc ciyaarta ka yihiin"" - meaning they were banned by the rules of the competition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wax xanuuna ma haynin** (He had no pain) - This contradicts the passage which states he *had* pain that needed medication.
* **B: Iyada xanuun ku ridaysa** (It was causing him pain) - This doesn't explain why he couldn't take medication.
* **C: Asaga ayaa ka walwalsanaa in ay si xun u saameyn doonto fayoqabkiisa** (He was worried it would negatively affect his health) - The passage doesn't mention concerns about side effects; it specifically mentions the ban.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa keeni kara jahawareer ku saabsan dhaqdhaqaaqa dhulgariirka?","The correct answer is **A: Jiritaanka daruuro madow**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Daruur madoow oo aan la xiriir wax foolkaane ah ayaa laga soo sheegay buurta salkeeda. Daruuruhu waxa ay suurto geliyen jahwareerka hawada in qarax folkaano rasmi ah dhacay iyo in kale."" This directly links the dark clouds to causing confusion about volcanic activity (and therefore, potentially, earthquake activity related to the volcano).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Warbixino ka soo baxay xafiiska saadaasha hawada ee Iceland** - The text says the Icelandic Met Office *reported no earthquakes*, which clarifies, not confuses, the situation.
*   **C: Khariidadda dhulgariirka caalamiga ah** - The USGS map *showed no earthquakes*, again clarifying, not causing confusion.
*   **D: Dhaqdhaqaaq ayaa laga soo sheegay meelaha kale ee Iceland** - The text doesn't mention any activity elsewhere causing confusion; it focuses on the Hekla region.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, goorma ayuu isbeddel marxaladeed dhaca?","The correct answer is **C: 10-kii Maarso**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Muhiimada dhacdooyinka dhul gariirka waxay sababan dhulka isbeddel sida kan dhacay **Maarso 10 keeda** dhanka waqooyi bari fulkanaha...""  This directly says the land change/shift happened on March 10th.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kahor 10-ka Maarso** - The text doesn't mention the shift happening *before* March 10th.
*   **B: 48 saac ee lasoo dhaafay** - The text mentions a 48-hour period *without* earthquakes, not when the shift occurred.
*   **D: Todobaadkii lasoo dhaafay** - The text mentions the USGS didn't record earthquakes in the last week, but this refers to earthquake recordings, not the land change."
Midkeebaan weedhahan soo socda ee ku saabsan baaritaanka dayaxa ee Chandrayaan-1 baan run ahayn?,"The correct answer is **A: Samo-wareegaha kiciyay dayax-gacmeedka yari wuxuu lahaa shaqaale**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that Chandrayaan's lander was *unmanned* (""aan cidi saarnayn""). This directly contradicts option A, which implies it had a crew.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **B: Dayax gacmeedka yari wuxuu ka koobnaa qalabyo muhiim ah** - The text says it carried ""saddex qalab oo saynis oo muhiim ah"".
*   **C: Diridda dayax gacmeedka yari waxay ahayd mid guuleystay** - The text states it ""si guul leh u fariistay"" (successfully landed).
*   **D: Dayax gacmeedka yari wuxuu lahaa dhinacyo midabaysan** - The text says it carried the Indian national flag, ""oo dhinac kasta ku rinjisan"" (dyed on each side)."
Keebaa weedhahan soo socda si sax ah u qeexaya baaritaanka dayax gacmeedka yar?,"The correct answer is **B: Soo degitaankeedii shileed wuxuu ahaa guul.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states the lander ""successfully landed near the south pole of the Moon."" This directly confirms a successful landing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waxay ku degtay meel u dhow cirifka woqooyi ee Dayaxa** - The passage explicitly states it landed near the *south* pole, not the north pole.
*   **C: Waxaa laga dhex saaray dayax gacmeedka wayn** - The passage doesn't mention being deployed from a larger lander. It's presented as having landed on its own.
*   **D: Waxay waday labo qalab oo aad u muhiim ah** - The passage states it carried *three* scientific instruments, not two.



"
"Iyada oo lagu salaynayo qoraalka, halbeegee ka hortagga cudur ayaa la hirgelin doonaa ugu dambeyn?","The correct answer is **C: Tallaalka encephalitis**.

Here's why:

The text states the government has pledged ""millions of doses of encephalitis vaccine"" to aid health agencies. While other measures are being taken (insecticide spraying, net distribution, pig culling), the vaccine is presented as a key part of the preventative effort, specifically to prepare for the upcoming year. The text also mentions a delay in the vaccine rollout due to funding, highlighting its importance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Daawooyinka cayayaanka** (Insecticides): These are being *used*, but are not the primary focus of long-term prevention as much as the vaccine.
*   **B: Doofaar ugaarsadayaal** (Pig culling): This is a reactive measure to control the spread, not a preventative one.
*   **D: Maro kaneecada** (Insecticide-treated nets): These are a preventative measure, but the text implies the vaccine is the more significant long-term strategy."
Sidee buu cudurku uugu gudbaa dadka?,"The correct answer is **A: Kaneecada**.

The text states: ""Xanuunka dilaacay wuxuu ku sababay in dawladda Indian ay qaado talabo ay ku qiyaaseyso horamarinta dabinka dofaarka iyo meelaha laga wax yeleyey, iyago u qeybinaya sidoo kale **shabaga kaneecada/maro kaneeco** iyo suntan cayayaanka."" It also mentions the disease is transmitted from pigs to humans *through* mosquitoes (kaneecada).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Daawooyinka cayayaanka** - These are used to *combat* the disease, not how it's transmitted.
*   **C: Doofaarka** - While pigs *carry* the disease, they don't directly transmit it to humans. It's an intermediary.
*   **D: Doofaar ugaarsadayaal** - This isn't mentioned in the text as a method of transmission.



"
Fashilanka jumlada labaad maxay noqon kartaa natiijada?,"The correct answer is **B: Xuquuqda mustaqbalka ee ururada rayidka ah ee guurka-isku-jinsiga ah**

Here's why:

The text states that the failure of the second vote ""could open the door to legally sanctioned marriages in the future."" This directly implies a positive outcome for same-sex marriage rights.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dib u eegis degdeg ah oo HJR-3:** While HJR-3 will be revisited, the text doesn't suggest this will be *immediate*. It specifies 2015 or 2016.
*   **C: Fadhi sharci dejineed oo deg-deg ah:** The text doesn't indicate any special session of the legislature is planned.
*   **D: Mamnuucidda ururada rayidk ah ee guurka-isku-jinsiga ah:** This is the opposite of what the text suggests. The failure of the ban is a *positive* development for these groups.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, goorma ayaa jumlada labaad la masaxay?","The correct answer is **C: Isniinta**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Fadhiga sharci dejinta ayaa isbeddel sameeyay ka dib markii xukunkii labaad ay ugu horreyntii masaxeen Golaha Shacabku ee **Isniinta** qaab la mid ah loogu gudbiyay Senate ka.""

This directly indicates the second resolution was struck down on a Monday.



"
"""Yaa si qarsoodiya loogu siidaayay """"Waraaqaha Panama""""?""","The correct answer is **B: Saxaafadda**.

The text states: ""Waraaqaha Baanama"" waa kelmad guud oo koobsanaysa ku dhawaad toban milyan oo dukumeenti oo laga helay shirkad sharciyeeda Reer Baanama Mossack Fonseca, **kuwaasoo saxaafadda hoosta looga dhiibay** gugii 2016.""

This clearly indicates the documents were leaked *to* the press (sxaafadda).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shirkadda Mossack Fonseca:** They *possessed* the documents, but didn't receive them.
*   **C: Bangiga Deutsche:** They were implicated in the documents, but didn't receive the leak.
*   **D: Madaxda dowladda Iceland:** They were affected by the revelations, but didn't receive the leak.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, yaa ay ku andacoonaysa saxaafadda Ingiriisku in uu maamulayay shirkado badan oo loo isticmaali jiray in lagu qariyo hantida?","The correct answer is **C: Bangiga Deutsche**.

The text states: ""Jariiradda Ingiriiska ee The Guardian ayaa soo jeedisay in Bangiga Deutsche uu maamulo ku dhowaad saddex meelood meel shirkadaha beenta ah ee tan lagu gaadhay."" This directly answers the question.
"
Shilalkan diyaaradeed midkee ayaa lahaa dhimashadii ugu badnayd?,"The correct answer is **A: Diyaaradda ayaa burburtay xilli ay kusii jeedday dalka Armenia, kana soo duushay dalka Iran.**

Here's why:

The text states that the plane crash en route to Armenia resulted in the deaths of 168 people, which is significantly higher than the other two incidents (3 deaths in the police helicopter crash and 17 deaths in the Mashhad crash).

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Burburkii diyaaradii helikopterka ahay ee booliska** - This only resulted in 3 deaths.
*   **C: Diyaaradda ayaa ku burburtay xilli ay ka soo duushay Armenia kuna sii jeeday dalka Iran** - This reverses the direction of the flight stated in the text.
*   **D: Diyaaradda ku burburtay Mashhad** - This resulted in 17 deaths, still fewer than the Armenia-bound plane."
Kuwaan soo socda keebaan sabab u ahayn shilalka badan ee diyaaradeed ee ka dhaca Iran?,"The correct answer is **C: Cunaqabataynada ayaa ka hor istaagaysa iibsashada diyaaradaha cusub**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Cunaqabateynta caalamiga waxa ay ka dhigneyd in diyaarad cusub lasoo gadan karin."" (International sanctions have made it impossible to buy new planes.) This directly links the sanctions to the inability to update the fleet.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Koox duug ah oo diyaarado rayid ah iyo kuwa militari ah:** While the passage mentions old planes, it doesn't state that *being old* is the direct cause of the crashes, only that they exist.
* **B: Miisaaniyad la'aanta u diidaysa iibsashada diyaarado cusub:** The passage attributes the lack of new planes to sanctions, not simply a lack of budget.
* **D: Koox diyaarado ah oo si liidata loo dayactiray:** The passage mentions poor maintenance (""si xun loo dayactiray"") as a problem, but it's a *result* of the inability to get new planes and the challenges caused by sanctions, not the primary cause. The root issue is being unable to replace aging and deteriorating aircraft.

Taas waxay ka dhigaysaa in kooxda cilmi baadhista Ciraaq **aysan** boorrinaynin in lagu dhawaaqo dammaanad lagu joojinayo rabshadaha.

Halkan fiiri sababaha kale ee jawaabaha kale aanay ahayn kuwa saxda ah:

*   **B: Jiho bedelidda degdegga ah:** Warbixintu si adag ayay ugu talinaysaa in ""si degdeg ah wax loo beddelo"" siyaasadda hadda.
*   **C: Adeegsiga dood furan:** Warbixintu waxay ku bilaabanaysaa codsi lagu codsanaayo ""dood furan iyo abaabulka midnimo Maraykanka dhexdiisa.""
*   **D: Asaasida hindise dublamaasiyadeed oo cusub:** Talooyinka ugu horeeya waxay ka mid yihiin ""in hindisi diblomaasiyeed la qaado sanadkan intuu dhamaanin"" iyo ""dib loola abaabulo xiriirada diblomaasiyeed."""
"Sida laga soo xigtay booliska, yaa loo tixgelinayay inuu ahaa kaaliyaha Provenzano?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

The text states: ""Booliisku waxay sheegeen in Lo Piccolo gacan sarreeyay maadaama uu ahaa gacanta midig ee Provenzano..."" This directly translates to ""Police said Lo Piccolo was prominent as he was the right-hand man of Provenzano...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Giovanni Falcone:** He was a judge who fought against the Mafia and was *killed* by them, not an aide to Provenzano.
*   **C: Ansa:** Ansa is the news agency that *reported* the information, not a person involved.
*   **D: Paolo Borsellino:** Like Falcone, he was a judge killed by the Mafia.



"
"Iyada oo lagu salaynayo macluumaadka lagu xusay qoraalka, maxaa sababay dhimashada Falcone?","The correct answer is **A: Waxa lagu dilay dagaalkii Riina ka socday**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...dagaalkii Riina ee looga soo horjeday gobolada dilay dadkii u doodi jiray Mafiyada Giovanni Falcone iyo Paolo Borsellino sanadka markuu ahaa 1992."" This clearly indicates that Falcone's death was a result of the conflict initiated by Riina.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: waxaa dilay booliska** - The text does not mention any involvement of the police in Falcone's death.
*   **C: Lo Piccolo ayaa lagu amray inuu dilo isaga** - While Lo Piccolo was a significant figure, the text doesn't state he was directly involved in Falcone's murder, only that he followed Provenzano's policies.
*   **D: Wuxuu ku dhintay gacanta saxiibkiisa Mafiyada saliibiga ee Paolo Borsellino** - The text doesn’t say Paolo Borsellino killed Falcone, instead saying they both died as a result of Riina's war."
Midkee kuwaan soo socda aanan ahayn abaalmarinihii Hitoshi Saito?,"Jawaabta saxda ah waa **D: Khabiir ku ah Judo**.

Inkastoo Hitoshi Saito uu ahaa khabiir Judo, qoraalku si cad uma sheegin inuu yahay abaalmarin uu helay. Saddexda kale (A, B, iyo C) ayaa lagu sheegay qoraalka:

*   **A: Laba jeer Koobka Adduunka ku guulaystay** - waxaa lagu sheegay ""Horyaalkii Adduunka"" oo lala jeedo Koobka Adduunka.
*   **B: Guddoomiyaha Ururka Judo ee Japan oo dhan** - waxaa lagu sheegay ""gudoomiyaha Judo Federation ka ee Jabbaaniiska""
*   **C: Ku guuleystaha labada jeer ee bilada dahabka Olimbikada** - waxaa lagu sheegay ""horaan reeyay labo dahab oo Ciyaraha Olambikada""."
Halkee ayuu Iwasaki naftiisa ku awooday inuu iska ilaaliyo inuu nidar galo?,"The correct answer is **A: Jabaan**.

Here's why:

The passage states Iwasaki faced difficulties *during his travels*. It doesn't say he nearly perished anywhere *on* those travels. The question asks where he was able to *avoid* perishing. He started his journey from Japan, and since the difficulties arose *during* his travels, it implies he was safe *before* he started traveling, which means he was safe in Japan.

The other options are all places where he *experienced* hardship, not where he avoided it."
Yaa soo weeraray Iwasaki?,"The correct answer is **C: Ey**.

The passage specifically states ""eey cudur qaba ayaa ku weeraray Tibet"" which translates to ""a sick yak attacked him in Tibet"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Xaaskiisa suurtagalka ah (His potential wife):** The passage says he *escaped* a marriage in Nepal, not that his potential wife attacked him.
*   **B: Burcad badeed (Pirates):** The passage mentions ""burcad"" (bandits/robbers) but doesn't specify they were pirates.
*   **D: Boolis (Police):** The passage says he was *arrested* by the police in India, not attacked."
Halee ayuu Alonso ku dhameeyay tartankiisii?,"The correct answer is **C: Kadib markii uu Schumacher dhameeyay tartankiisii**.

Here's why:

The text states Fernando Alonso led for much of the race but finished shortly after Michael Schumacher had a problem with his brakes. This implies Alonso finished *after* Schumacher's issue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kadib markii Schumacher uu ka waxyeelleeyay afka hore ee lugta** - The text doesn't mention Schumacher damaging his leg.
*   **B: Fisichella wuxuu lumiyay xakamaynta gaarigiisa** - This refers to Fisichella, not Alonso.
*   **D: Intuusan hogaanka qaban** - Alonso finished *after* leading, not before.



"
Maxaa sababay in Schumacher dhameeyo tartankiisa xilli hore?,"The correct answer is **D: Waxyeellada soo gaartay laalka gaariga** (Damage to the car's brakes).

The text specifically states: ""Michael Schumacher wuxuu dhammeeyay tartankiisii ​​wakhti aan dheerayn Alonso kadib, sababtuna tahay biraha shaagaga ayaa cillad ku timi intii uu socday tartanku."" This translates to ""Michael Schumacher finished his race shortly after Alonso, because there was a fault with the brake discs during the race.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wuxuu lumiyay xakamaynta gaarigiisa** (He lost control of his car) - The text doesn't say Schumacher lost control.
*   **B: Isku dhac dhex maray asaga iyo Alonso** (A collision between him and Alonso) - The text doesn't mention a collision.
*   **C: Khasaare ka gaaray taayirrada oo kaga yimid dhanka Fisichella** (Damage to the tires caused by Fisichella) - The text states the brake discs were the problem, not the tires, and Fisichella was already out of the race."
"Sida ku xusan mariska, yay ahayd shaqadiisa inuu u jaangooyo kafaala qaadida dadka xiran?","Jawaabta saxda ah waa **D: Gudoomiyaha maxkamada**.

Mariska ayaa sheegaya in Gudoomiyaha maxkamada ""qoondeeyo damiinashada, hadii la ogolaado"". Taas micnaheedu waa inuu yahay mas'uulka u jaangooyay arrimaha kafaala qaadka ee dadka xiran."
"Marka loo eego amarka xannibaadda ku-meel-gaarka ah ee lagu sheegay mariska, maxaa loo oggol yahay dadka la soo xiray si loogu sii hayo in ka badan 24 saacadood?","The correct answer is **C: Eedaha rasmiga ah ee uu soo saaray Garsoore Glynn**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Judge Glynn issued a restraint order to enforce the release of those held more than 24 hours without their cases being heard in court. This implies that *without* official charges filed by a judge (like Glynn), holding someone for over 24 hours is not permitted. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Damiin (Bail)** - Bail is something *granted* after charges are filed, not a reason to *continue* holding someone.
*   **B: Kulan lala yeelasho sarkaalkii xiray (Meeting with the arresting officer)** - A meeting doesn't justify prolonged detention.
*   **D: Dhageysiga maxkamada (Court hearing)** - The passage states a hearing *marks* the date of the accused's right to a speedy trial, it doesn't justify holding someone beyond the 24-hour limit."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, sababtee loo isticmaali waayay in lagu sharaxo tartanka la joojiyay?","The correct answer is **A: Khataraha amaanka**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states Lodin claimed the decision to cancel the election was to ""spare the Afghan people the cost and security risk of further elections.""  While the passage *also* mentions constitutional concerns, it frames those as something diplomats *found* to support the decision, not as the primary reason for it. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Isburinta dastuurka:** The passage suggests the cancellation *aligns* with constitutional issues found by diplomats, not that it was caused by a direct violation of the constitution.
*   **C: Kharashaadka aadka u badan:**  While cost is mentioned alongside security risk, the primary focus is on the danger.
*   **D: Madmadowga dastuuriga ah:** This is a more complex concept, and the passage doesn't frame it as the direct reason for cancelling the vote. It points to a lack of clear constitutional guidance.



"
Waa maxay sababta dibloomasiyiintu aay ugu dambayntii u qaateen tartanka in uu yahay mid aan loo baahnayn?,"The correct answer is **C: Waxaa jiray mugdiyo badan oo kajira xaga dastuurka**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Diblomaasiyiinta ayaa sheegay inay heleen hubniin la’aan ku filan dastuurka Afghanistan oo ay ku go’aamiyaan ku celinta marxaladda ugu dambeysay ee doorashadda in loo baahneen."" This directly translates to ""Diplomats said they found enough ambiguity in the Afghan constitution to justify canceling the final phase of the election.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waxay ka hortimid dastuurka** - The text doesn't say they opposed the constitution, but that they *found ambiguity within it.*
*   **B: Waxaa jiray khataro dhanka ammaanka ah** - While the text mentions security risks, this wasn't the *reason* diplomats decided to cancel the election. It was a factor Lodin mentioned related to cost and risk *to the citizens*, but not the diplomats' justification.
*   **D: Doorashada ayaa ahayd mid aad qaali u ah** - The cost is mentioned as a factor Lodin gave, but not the diplomats' reason.



"
Yaa bixiyaa adeegyada garsoorka FATA?,"The correct answer is **B: Wakiilada Siyaasada (Political Agents)**.

The passage explicitly states that the Political Agents are ""responsible for providing government judicial services under Article 247 of the Pakistan Constitution"" in FATA.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dowladda Pakistan (Government of Pakistan)** - While ultimately the government is responsible, the passage says the *agents* deliver the services.
*   **C: Madaxweeynaha wadanka Pakistan (President of Pakistan)** - The President appoints the agents, but doesn't directly provide the services.
*   **D: Dowladda Ingiriiska (British Government)** - The passage states this system began *after* Pakistan's independence from British rule.



"
"""Keebaa weedhahan soo socda ee ku saabsan """"Wakiilada Siyaasadeed"""" ee FATA aan run ahayn?""","The correct answer is **A: Waxay bixiyaan adeegyada garsoorka**.

Here's why:

The passage states they provide ""legal services of the government *under* Article 247 of the Pakistan Constitution."" This implies they facilitate legal processes *within* the framework of the constitution, but doesn't mean they *are* the courts or provide full judicial services. They act as intermediaries.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

*   **B: Iyaga waxaa soo xushay madaxweynaha Pakistan:** The passage explicitly states the President of Pakistan appointed the Political Agents.
*   **C: Waxay u hoggaansameen dastuurka Pakistan:** They operate under Article 247 of the Pakistan Constitution, demonstrating adherence.
*   **D: Waxay si buuxda gacanta ugu hayaan goobaha qaarkood:** The passage says they ""almost independently controlled these areas,"" indicating a strong degree of control.



"
Abaalmarintee ayay Emma Stone loo magacaabay?,"The correct answer is **C: Atariishada ugu Fiican** (Best Actress).

The passage states: ""Goslin iyo Stone ayaa loo soo saaray inay u tartamaqn Jilaaga iyo Jilaayadda ugu fiican siday u kala horeeyaan."" This directly means Emma Stone was nominated for Best Actress."
Abaalmarintee ayaan filimkaas aan loo magacaabin?,"The correct answer is **B: Saamaynta Muuqaalka ee ugu Fiican**.

Here's why:

The text lists all the categories the film *was* nominated for. It specifically mentions:

*   Jilaaga ugu fiican & Jilaayadda ugu fiican
*   Sawirka ugu Wanaagsan
*   Agaasimaha
*   Filmaanta
*   Diyaarinta Dharka, Diyaarinta Filimka, Muqaalka Asalka, Diyaarinta Waxsoosarka, Diyaarinta Codka, Cod isku geynta
*   Heesta asalka ah ee ugu wacan

The only option *not* on this list is ""Saamaynta Muuqaalka ee ugu Fiican"". Therefore, it's the category the film wasn't nominated for."

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, kuwan soo socda kee baa ayuu waxyeello u geystay dhulgariirku?","The correct answer is **A: Guryaha qaar**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states ""9400 homes in the area are without water"" and ""nearly 100 are without electricity."" This indicates damage or disruption to homes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Laba fal-gale oo laga isticmaalo warshada tamarta Shika** - The passage mentions the Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear power plant, not the Shika power plant. Additionally, it states the plant was operating normally.
*   **C: Wadooyinka qaar** - The passage states ""some roads are damaged,"" but this is not a direct indication of *who* the earthquake harmed.
*   **D: Garoonka diyaaradaha ee Noto** - The passage states the airport is closed, but this is a disruption of service, not necessarily damage *to* the airport itself or harm to people/property.

*   **Mustaqbalka Jerusalem** waxaa ku sheegay dukumeentiga in looga doodayo in magaalada qaddus (Jerusalem) ay ka muqaddas tahay labada qaran.
*   **Joogitaanka ciidan ee toga ama dooxada** waxaa ku sheegay dukumeentiga in Israel dalbaneysa iney joogaan tobban sano, halka PA ay isku raacday shaan.

Si kastaba ha ahaatee, dukumiintigu **ma sheego** sababta keentay dagaalkii 1967."
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan ka mid ahayn dalabaadka aay doonayso Falastiin?,"Jawaabta saxda ah waa **D: Shan sano oo ciidan uu ku sugnaanayo dooxada ama toga Jordan**.

Halkan waxaa ah sababta:

* **Dukumiintiga** wuxuu sheegay in Falastiin ay dooneysay in Israel ay ciidamada ka saarto dooxada Jordan shantii sano ee ugu horeysay. Israel ayaa dalbaneysay 10 sano, laakiin Falastiin ma aysan dalban in ay ciidanku shantii sano joogaan.

Halkan waxaa ku qeexan sababaha kale uusan jawaabaha kale ahayn:

*   **A: Xaaladaha dagaalka ee hordhaca u ah dagaalka asalkiisa yahay xuduudaha:** Dukumiintiga ayaa sheegay in Falastiin ay dooneysay xuduudaha ka horeeya dagaalkii 1967, taas oo macnaheedu yahay iney dooneysay in xaaladaha dagaalka lagu soo celiyo.
*   **B: Joogitaanka ciidanka ee ka socda dooxada ama toga Jordan:** Dukumiintiga ayaa sheegay in waxaa jiray muran ku saabsan joogitaanka ciidanka Israel ee dooxada Jordan, taas oo ah arin Falastiin ay daneeyo.
*   **C: Jawaabo ku saabsan mustaqbalka Jerusalem:** Dukumiintiga ayaa sheegay in ay jiraan arimo la dhameeyay oo ku saabsan maamulka Jerusalem."
Dalkee ayay Ma uu ku baratay cilmiga sharciga?,"The correct answer is **A: Maraykanka (USA)**.

The text states: ""Ma waxa uu dhigtay Jaamacada New York iyo **Dugsiga Sharciga ee Harvard** marna waxa uu lahaa kaarka degganaasha rasmiga ee Mareykanka """"green card""""."" Harvard is a law school in the United States. 

Therefore, Ma studied law in the USA."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, wadankee u gargaaray u doodista guusha doorashada Ma?","The correct answer is **D: Shiinaha**.

The text states: ""In kastoo eedaym ay jiraan, Ma waxa uu si fiican ugu guulaystay inuu xiriir dhow la yeesho dhulwaynaha Shiineeska.""  This directly indicates that he succeeded in building a close relationship with mainland China, which aided his electoral success.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maraykanka:** While he was educated in the US and had a green card, the text doesn't say the US *helped* his campaign.
*   **B: Hong Kong:** He was born there, but the text doesn't mention Hong Kong helping his campaign.
*   **C: Boqortooyada Ingiriiska:** There is no mention of the UK in the passage.

"Sida ku xusan tuduca, yuu Carolyn Wilson u shaqeeyay ka hor inta uusan magaalada kuusan ka tagin?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

The passage states: ""…Carolyn Wilson ee shirkadda OHA ay dhacday lacagtii dhigashada, ka dib na magaalada ka baxsatay."" This directly tells us she worked for OHA before leaving town."
"Iyadoo afar tartan ay ka harsan yihiin xilli ciyaareedka, yaa ku jira kaalinta afraad ee Horyaalka Darawallada?","The correct answer is **D: Bowyer**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hamlin ayaa labaatan dhibcood danbeeya, balse shan ka horeeya Bowyer.""  This translates to: ""Hamlin is twenty points ahead, but five ahead of Bowyer.""

This means Bowyer is in fifth place. Given that Hamlin is third and Kahne is fifth, Bowyer must be in fourth.
"
"Ayada oo la raacaayo tartanka lagu sheegay ama lagu xusay tuduca, imisa dhibcood ayuu Kahne ka leeyahay ama uu ka helay Horyaalka Darawaliinta?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The text states: ""Kahne iyo Truex, Jr. iyana waxay ku jiraan kaalinta shanaad iyo lixaad siday u kala horeeyaan iyagoo kala wata 2,220 iyo 2,207 dhibcood.""  This clearly indicates Kahne has 2,220 points."

The passage states: ""Waxa la rumaysan yahay inay tani tahay markii shanaad ee dadku arkaan shay kiimiko ahaan loo xaqiijiyay inuu Maaras ka yimi oo Dhulka ku soo dhacay."" which translates to ""It is believed that this is the fifth time people have seen an object chemically confirmed to have come from Mars and fallen to Earth."""

Goorma ayuu Schumacher shaqada ka fadhiistay?,"The correct answer is **B: Kadib markii uu ku guulaystay horyaalkiisi toddobaad.**

The text states: ""Schumacher oo howlgab noqday sanadka markuu aha 2006 ka bacdi marka uu ku guleystay Formula 1 ee todobo jeer..."" This directly says he retired after winning his seventh championship in 2006.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kadib shilkii Felipe Massa:** The text says he *was considered to replace* Massa, but this wasn't the reason for his initial retirement.
*   **C: Ka dib markii la bedelay Felipe Massa:** He was *considered* for the replacement, but hadn't actually taken the role.
*   **D: Dhamaadka xilli ciyaareedkii 2009:** His retirement was in 2006, not 2009.



"
Goorma ayuu Massa dhaawacmay?,"The correct answer is **A: Inta lagu jiray tartanka Grand Prix**.

The text specifically states Massa was injured during the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2009.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The text says he was injured *after* winning seven Formula 1 championships, not *after* winning the championship.
*   **C:** Schumacher was expected to replace Massa *because* of his injury, not before.
*   **D:** The text specifies the injury happened *during* the 2009 season, not before it began."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, sidee dib u habaynta u saamayni doontaa AOL?","The correct answer is **C: Tirada isticmaaleyaasha AOL waxa la tartami doona isticmaaleyaasha Yahoo iyo Microsoft**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the combined number of Yahoo! and Microsoft users *could equal* AOL's customer base. This means AOL will face increased competition, and its dominance in the IM market will be challenged.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage suggests the opposite - competition will likely *decrease* AOL's market share, not increase it.
*   **B:** The passage implies AOL will *lose* its unique position as the dominant player.
*   **D:** There is no indication that AOL will no longer be used in the US."
Kuwa soo socda kee baa laga yaabaa inuu dhammaan doono kadib markii la sameeyay habaynta cusub?,"The correct answer is **C: Xornimada AOL ee aay u hormarinayso suuqa ballaaran ee u gaarka ah**.

Here's why:

The passage states that AOL has been able to ""maneuver and dominate"" the IM market *because* of its widespread use in the US. However, it then suggests that this freedom (to dominate) might end as the combined user base of Yahoo! and Microsoft could equal AOL's.  The passage is specifically talking about a potential loss of AOL's unique position and control.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Horumarinta Ballaaran ee xaga internetka ee Wadanka Mareykanka** - The passage doesn't discuss overall internet growth.
*   **B: Isticmaalka suuqa IM-ka** - The passage doesn't say IM use will decline, just that AOL's dominance may be challenged.
*   **D: Iskaashiga shirkadaha Yahoo iyo Microsoft** - This is the *cause* of the potential change, not what might end.



"
Immisa qof ayaa lagu dilay weerarka oo aan ahayn askar boolis ah?,"The correct answer is **C: 0**.

Here's why:

* The text states two police officers were killed.
* It says over twenty people were injured, and of those injuries, 19 were police officers.  This implies the remaining injuries were to civilians, but *no civilians were reported killed*.
* Therefore, zero people were killed who weren't police officers.



"
Ayaa soo sheegtay qofka la tuhunsan yahay ee weerarka lagu eedeeyey?,"The correct answer is **A: Booliiska** (The Police).

The text states: ""Booliska ayaa sheegay inay uga shakisan yihiin qof mitid ah oo ka tirsan Daesb (ISIL) inuu weerarka ka masuul ahaa."" This directly translates to ""The police stated they suspect an individual affiliated with Daesh (ISIL) was responsible for the attack.""



"
"Natiijo ahaan xaalada Florida maadaama warka guuleystuhu uu qabsaday dhamaan gobolka, maxaa la guddoonsiiyay Mitt Romney?","The correct answer is **C: Dhammaan ergooyinka gobolka**.

The text states: ""Guuleyste ahaan wuxuu lawareegaayaa gobalkoo dhan, Florida ayaa wada siisay kontonkeeda ergo Romney..."" This clearly indicates that Romney received all of Florida's delegates.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 32 ka mid ah ergooyinka gobolka:** This is the percentage Newt Gingrich received, not Romney.
* **B: Magacaabista Xisbiga Jamhuuriga ah:** The Florida primary contributes to, but does not automatically award, the Republican nomination.
* **D: 46 boqolkiiba codadka:** This is Romney's percentage of the vote, not what he received *as a result* of winning.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, boqolkiiba intee in le'eg ayuu Gingrich ka helay doorashadii hore?","The correct answer is **B: Boqolkiiba 32**.

The text clearly states: ""Afhayeenkii hore Aqalka New Gingrich ayaa kaalinta labaad ku soo galay 32 boqolkiiba."" (Former Speaker of the House New Gingrich came in second with 32 percent of the vote.)"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, yaan sii wadin ka qayb qaadashada tartanka kadib natiijooyinkii shirka xisbiga baarlamaanka?","The correct answer is **B: Bachmann**.

The text specifically states: ""Bachmann, taasoo ku guuleysatay Doorashadii Ames Straw ee Ogos, waxay go’aansatay inay dhameyso ololaha."" (Bachmann, who won the Ames Straw Poll in August, decided to end her campaign).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gingrich** - The text says Gingrich congratulated Santorum but criticized Romney, and continued his campaign.
*   **C: Perry** - The text states Perry initially considered withdrawing, but then decided to continue campaigning.
*   **D: Romney** - The text mentions Romney being the target of negative ads but doesn't say he withdrew from the race.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Yaa si weyn uga hadlay musharrax kale kadib natiijada shirka xisbiga baarlamaanka?","The correct answer is **B: Gingrich**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gingrich ayaa u hambalyaayay Santorum lakin hadal adag ku dhahay Romney, oo isaga magaciisa xayaysiino olole xun logu samayay Iowa oo lola jeeday Gingrich."" This directly translates to ""Gingrich congratulated Santorum but spoke harshly about Romney, whose name was used in a bad campaign advertisement in Iowa that opposed Gingrich.""

This clearly shows Gingrich was the one who spoke out strongly against another candidate (Romney) after the results came in.



"
Aaway meesha kaliya ee bandhigga lagu soo bandhigay ka hor 2015?,"The correct answer is **A: TogiNet Radio**.

The text states: ""In its early days, the program completely spun off of the long-standing internet station TogiNet Radio..."" This means TogiNet Radio was the only place the show was available before 2015.
"
Idaacada ayaa qeexaysa bandhiga noocee ayaa lafdhabarta u ah?,"The correct answer is **C: Dugsigii hore**.

Here's why:

The text specifically describes the program as ""raadiyaha iskuulka hore ee tiyaatarka cusba hormarsanana ee la hormariyey!"" which translates to ""the old school theater's advanced and progressive radio!"". This clearly identifies the show as having roots in a school setting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Qofka hawsha bashaalka u sameeya (The person who performs the task)**: This doesn't relate to the description of the show's origins.
*   **B: Qofka aadka u maskaxda badan (The very intelligent person)**: This is a descriptor of a person, not the show's nature.
*   **D: Maxaliga ah (Local)**: While the origin is in East Texas, ""old school"" is the primary defining characteristic mentioned.

Muxuu David Headley soo aruuriyay ee ugu dambeyntii ka caawiyay weerarka aay kuso qaadeen kooxda xagjirka ah?,"The correct answer is **A: Macluumaad (Information)**.

The text states that David Headley's ""sahminta iyo war uruurinta"" (sharing and gathering of information) aided the attack. This means he provided information that helped the terrorists.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: bam-gacmeedyo (hand grenades)** - The terrorists *used* hand grenades, but Headley didn't supply them.
*   **C: Dabley hubeeysan (armed men)** - He wasn't one of the attackers.
*   **D: Hubka otomaatigada ah ee aadka u dhaca (automatic weapons)** - Again, the terrorists used these, but Headley didn't provide them."
Waa noocee nooca gaadiidka ah ee ay isticmaalayeen kooxda xagjirka ah si ay ugu so safraan Mumbai?,"The correct answer is **C: Doon**.

The text states: ""Weerareyaasha Mumbai ayaa ku imaaday **doon** Nofeembar 26, 2008..."" which translates to ""The Mumbai attackers arrived by **boat** on November 26, 2008..."""
Qodobkee si sax ah uga turjumaya natiijada ciyaarti iska caadiga ahayd ee Brisbane ee aay ciyaareen Nadal iyo Raonic ee ku xusan tuduca?,"The correct answer is **C: Nadal ayaa ka badiyay ama ka reeyay Raonic**.

Here's why:

*   The text states Nadal ""mardhow ka badiye Raonic"" which translates to ""recently defeated Raonic"".
*   The text also says Nadal won 76 points in the first set, implying he was winning the match.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Raonic ayaa ka badiyay ama ka reeyay Nadal** - The text clearly states Nadal won.
*   **B: Raonic wuxuu lahaa 88% dhibcood oo saafi ah** - The text states Nadal had 88% of the points, not Raonic.
*   **D: Raonic wuxuu keenay 76 dhibcood** - The text says Nadal won 76 points, not Raonic.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Muxuu ahaa kala saraaynta cyaarta Nadal iyo Raonic kulankii koowaad kadib?","The correct answer is **C: Natiijadu waxay noqotay 7-2**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Diwaan galinta Madax madax ee Nadal iska hor imaadkii Kanadiyaanka ayaa ahayd 7-2."" This refers to the head-to-head record between Nadal and the Canadian (Raonic).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Raonic wuxuu lahaa 88% dhibcood oo saafi ah:** The passage states Nadal won 88% of the points, not Raonic.
*   **B: Nadaal ayaa ku guuleystay 76 dhibcood:** While Nadal did win 76 points in the first set, this doesn't represent the overall game score.
*   **D: Raonic ayaa ka badiyay ama ka reeyay Nadal:** The passage states Nadal defeated Raonic."
Waa kuwee barnaamijka luqadd ee aan lagu darin saddexda warar ee bayaanka ah ee cusub ee hada la baahinaayo?,"The correct answer is **C: Jabbaan**.

Here's why:

The passage states Naked News *already* broadcasts in English and Japanese. The new additions are Spanish, Italian, and Korean. Therefore, Japanese is the only language from the options that wasn't newly added."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Xagee laga heli doonin baahinta wararka bayaanka ah ee cusub?","The correct answer is **B: Internetka**.

Here's why:

The text states the new language programs will be available on ""websaytyada iyo aalada moobilada"" (websites and mobile devices). Websites are accessed via the internet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Taleefannada gacanta** - While mobile devices *access* the internet, the text doesn't say the broadcasts will be *on* mobile phones directly.
*   **C: Tiyaatarada** - The text doesn't mention any theatrical releases.
*   **D: Telefishanka** - The text explicitly mentions television as a platform, but the question asks where they **won't** be found. The internet is the key addition to their platforms.



"
Immisa tartame ayaan dhammaysirin ciyaarta Giant Slalom?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""45 kamida 117 ka wadarka guud ee baraf-simbirixleyaasha ku sugnaa Giant Slalom ayaa ku guuldaraystay inay kaalin ka galaan tartarka."" This directly answers the question of how many competitors did not finish the Giant Slalom.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 36** - This refers to the number of people who had a ""Did Not Finish"" in the first Slalom, not the Giant Slalom.
*   **B: 117** - This is the *total* number of competitors in the Giant Slalom, not the number who didn't finish.
*   **C: 4** - This refers to the number of women's downhill skiers who didn't finish, not the overall Giant Slalom."
Keebaa bayaanada soo socda si sax ah uga tarjumaya natiijooyinka tartamada Horyaalada?,"Jawaabta saxda ah waa **B: 45 kamid ah ciyaartooyda ciyaarta barafka a skier-ka ku tartama ayaa dhamaystirin tartankooda aay tartamaayeen ciyaarta Giant Slalom.**

Halkan waxaa lagu sharxayaa sababta jawaabaha kale u khaldan yihiin:

*   **A:** Bogga wuxuu sheegayaa in Carpanedo ay 2:11.60 daqiiqo ka gaabiyay qofka koowaad, taas oo macnaheeda ay ka dambeysay qofka Hungary-ga ah ee ku galay kaalinta sagaalaad.
*   **C:** Bogga wuxuu sheegayaa in 36 ka mid ah 116 tartamayaal ay ku guuldareysteen Slalom-ka, taas oo macnaheeda in dad badan ay dhamaysteen Giant Slalom laakiin ma bixinayo faahfaahin ku saabsan tirada saxda ah.

Kuwan soo socda keebaa NBA go'aansatay inay hakiso ama aay joojiso?,"The correct answer is **A: Xili ciyaareedeeka kubbadda koleyga** (The basketball season).

The passage clearly states the NBA suspended its *basketball season* due to COVID-19 concerns. While the situation started with players on the Utah Jazz, the suspension was of the entire season, not just the players or the team.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaa keenay welwelka NBA ee ku saabsan fayraska?","The correct answer is **D: Ciyaartooy u ciyaara Utah Jazz ayaa laga helay cudurka**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Go’aanka NBA ayaa ka dambeeyey ciyaartooy Utah Jazz oo baaritaanka lagu xaqiijiyay inuu qabo viruska COVID-19."" This directly translates to ""The NBA's decision followed a Utah Jazz player testing positive for the COVID-19 virus.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Xubnooyin katirsan NBA ayaa laga helay cudurka** - While true, the passage *specifically* mentions Utah Jazz players.
*   **B: Dhawr ciyaartoy ayaa laga helay cudurka ciyaartii Utah Jazz** - The passage doesn’t specify *how many* players, just that players from Utah Jazz tested positive.
*   **C: Ciyaaryahan u ciyaara Utah Jazz ayaa hoos u dhac ku yimid a dib markii laga helay cudurka** - The passage doesn't mention any decline in condition.

Yaa u dhaliyay goolkii guusha Washington Capitals ciyaartii ay la ciyaareen Atlanta Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **A: Nicklas Backstrom**.

The passage states: ""Caawintii ugu horeysay ee Overchkin ee habeenka waxay ahayd tii goolkii guusha ciyaarta keenay uu dhaliyay Nicklas Backsrtom."" (The first assist of Ovechkin's night was on the game-winning goal scored by Nicklas Backstrom.)"
Yaa dhaliyay goolkiisii ​​60-aad ee xilli ciyaareedkan intii uu socday kulankii u dhexeeyay Capitals iyoThrashers?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The passage states: ""...goolkiisa labaad ee habeenka ayaa ahaa midkiisa 60aad ee xiligaas..."" This directly indicates that Alex Ovechkin scored his 60th goal of the season.

The passage also mentions Jaromir Jagr and Mario Lemieux reaching 60 goals in a season previously, but it doesn't say they scored *in this game*."
Goorma ayuu bangiga Northern Rock uga baahan yahay taageerada dawladda?,"The correct answer is **D: Xiligii aay taagnayd xiisaddii amaahda guryaha** (During the time of the mortgage crisis).

Here's why:

The text states that Northern Rock needed help *because* of the financial difficulties of 2007. These difficulties were directly related to the mortgage crisis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kadib markii bangiga laga dhigay bangi qaran** (After the bank was nationalized) - Nationalization happened *as a result* of needing support, not *before*.
*   **B: Marka bangiga laga dhex saaro shirkada maaraynta hantida** (When the bank was separated from the asset management company) - This happened *after* the initial need for support.
*   **C: Kadib markii kooxda Virgin Group ay iibsadeen bangiga** (After the Virgin Group bought the bank) - Virgin only bought part of the bank *after* it was nationalized and split."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Keebaa qodobada soo socda kamidd ah oo si sax ah u qeexaya Dhaqdhaqaaqa ganacsi ee kooxda Virgin Group ee aay la leeyihiin bangiga Northern Rock?","Jawabta saxda ah waa **B: Kooxda Virgin Group ayaa iibsatay bangiga ka dib markii bangiga laga dhigay bangi qaran.**

Halkan sababta:

*   Tuducyada ayaa sheegaya in Virgin kaliya ay iibsatey ""bangiga wanaagsan"" ee Northern Rock *kadib* markii dawladda la wareegtay, taas oo macnaheedu yahay in ay iibsatay kadib markii bangiga laga dhigay mid qaran.

Halkan sababta jawaabaha kale ay khaldan yihiin:

*   **A:** Tuducyada ayaa si cad u sheegaya in Virgin *aay iibsan* shirkadda maamulka hantida.
*   **C:** Tuducyada ayaa sheegaya in Richard Branson uu dalab soo diray, laakiin kama sheegayaan in Virgin ay siisay taageerada degdega ah.
*   **D:** Tuducyada ayaa sheegaya in dalabka Virgin la diiday *kahor* inta aan bangiga la qarameyn, oo taasi macnaheedu waa ka hor inta aan laga dhigin bangi qaran."
"Sida ku xusan tuduca, qarankee ayuu saameeyaa saxiixa heshiiska cimilada ee Kyoto?","The correct answer is **A: Maraykanka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go'aanka Md. Rudd ee lagu ansixinayo heshiiska cimiladu wuxu gooni u saaraya Maraykanka, oo hadda noqon doonta waddanka keliya ee horumaray ee aan ansixin heshiiska."" This directly states that the US is the only developed country *not* ratifying the climate agreement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hindiya:** The passage mentions India as a country that didn't have emissions limits, but doesn't say the agreement affects them in the same way as the US.
*   **C: Australia:** The passage states the *previous* conservative Australian government rejected Kyoto, but the current Rudd government *is* ratifying it.
*   **D: Shiinaha:** Similar to India, China is mentioned as not having emissions limits, but not as being negatively affected by the agreement itself.



"
Dawladdii hore ee Australia maxey u malaynaysay in ansixinta heshiiska cimilada ee Kyoto ay waxyeello u keeni doonto?,"The correct answer is **B: Dhaqaalaha wadanka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Dawladii hore konsarfatifka ahayd ee Ustareeliya ayaa diiday inay ansixiso Kyoto, iyadoo sheegtay inuu **dhaawacayo dhaqaalaha** maadaama ay si wayn ugu tiirsan tahay dhoofinta dhuxusha...""

While the passage *also* mentions coal exports (C) and concerns about emissions targets (D), the primary reason given for rejecting the Kyoto Protocol was the perceived harm to the overall economy. The impact on the economy is the overarching concern.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maraykanka** - The passage mentions the US's stance, but it's not the reason Australia rejected Kyoto.
*   **C: Dhoofinta dhuxusha** - This is a *part* of the reason, but the passage states the concern is about the economy *because* of coal exports, not just the exports themselves.
*   **D: Bartilmaameedka qiiqa wadanka uu sii daaynaayo** - The passage mentions other countries weren't bound by limits, but this isn’t the reason Australia refused to ratify the agreement.



"
Barnaamijkee ayaa toogasha yaqaanada safka kujir looso shaqaaleeyay?,"The correct answer is **D: Barnaamijka isboortiga ugaarsiga ee Ururka toogasha yaqaanada**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...mutadawiciin xirfadleyaal ah ayaa laga shaqaaleysiiyay, **barnaamijka ugaarsiga ururka difaaca isboortiga**. "" This directly links the employment of the shooters to the shooting program run by the NSW Sporting Shooters Association.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text mentions the NSW Sporting Shooters Association but not a ""Australia"" program.
*   **B:** The text doesn't mention a ""Dhaqanka iyo Ilaalinta Beerta"" program.
*   **C:** While NPWS is involved in the overall effort, they didn't directly *employ* the shooters; they partnered with the shooting association who did.



"
Qodobkee ayaan si sax ah uga tarjumeynin tijaabada xakamaynta cayayaanka?,"The correct answer is **A: Maadaama ay ahayd tijaabadii ugu horreysay ee barnaamijka, wax qiimayn ah laguma samaynin**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the trial is *ongoing* and that they are ""monitoring the trial and assessing its effectiveness"".  This means they *are* assessing the trial.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

*   **B: Toogasha yaqaanadu waxay heleen tilmaamo tababareed** - The text says ""four shooters selected for the initial cull received accreditation and training.""
*   **C: Dadka toogasha yaqaanadu ayaa waxaa ilaalinayay ilaalada beerta xanaanada xayawaanada** -  The text states ""close supervision by park rangers""
*   **D: Afar qof oo Toogasha yaqaan ah ayaa la doortay** - The text says ""four shooters were selected.""

Therefore, A is the only statement that contradicts the information given in the passage."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, halkee ayaa kala go’itaanka ama kala dilaaca lagu arkay?","The correct answer is **D: Dalka Itoobiya (Ethiopia)**.

Here's why:

The text states the researcher is based at the Rift Valley Research Service **in Ethiopia**. He's discussing the implications of findings based on early fossils. While the breakup is *related* to fossils, it's stated to have been found in the context of work being done *in Ethiopia*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waadiga weeyn (Great Rift Valley):** While related to the location, the text doesn’t say the split *occurred* in the Great Rift Valley, just that the research service is located there.
*   **B: Qalfoofka dushiisa ama fosilka (Fossil surface/fossils):** The fossils are *evidence* of the split, but the split itself wasn’t *on* the fossils.
*   **C: Caddaymaha molekuulka (Molecular evidence):** The text is about fossil evidence, not molecular evidence.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Maxaa dhacay isla markiiba oo si lama filaan ah ku dhacay?","The correct answer is **B: Kala qaybsanaanta ama dilaaca**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...kala qeybsanaanta waa ay ka horeysaa sidii la filaayay caddeynta moodeelka.""  This translates to ""...the split is earlier than expected evidence of the model."" This means the separation (or breakup/divergence) happened *before* the evidence supporting the existing model was found – indicating it was sudden and unexpected.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Habka laguso ogaanayo qalfoofka ama fosilka:** The text mentions research and fossils, but doesn’t say the *discovery* happened suddenly.
*   **C: Falanqaynta caddaynta molekuulka:** This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Cilmi-baarista laga sameeyay Waadiga weeyn:** The Rift Valley research is the context, not the event that happened suddenly.

Here's why:

The text states the controller allows players to control actions ""by moving the device through the air."" This directly corresponds to waving or manipulating the controller in the air.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text doesn't mention needing to position the controller near the screen.
*   **B:** The text says it uses a three-dimensional space, but doesn't instruct the player to *make* a three-sided space.
*   **C:** The text implies the controller is wireless and can be used away from the TV, not necessarily *right* next to it."
Waa maxay waxa loo naqshadeeyay inuu u ekaado sida hagaha telefishinka?,"The correct answer is **A: Labada hagayaal ee uu leeyahay koontaroolaha**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Dib u soo celinta ramuudka tifiga, maamulaha waxaa loo isticmala laba dareen wade oo u dhaw isticmalaha tifiga."" This directly translates to the controller having two sensors that resemble television remotes. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hagaha Kacaanka ah ee Nintendo** - This is the name of the console, not what's designed to *look like* a TV remote.
*   **C: Bandhiga muhiimka ah** - This refers to the Tokyo Game Show presentation.
*   **D: Qaybta Hagaha Kacaanka Nintendo** - This is too broad and doesn't directly relate to the remote resemblance."
Waa maxay waxa aan lagu sheegin warbixintii ugu dambeysay ee ka soo baxday wakaaladda wararka ee Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **A: Diyaaradda ayaa loogu hanjabay in la qarxini doono**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Warar danbe ayaa sheegay in diyaarada loogu hanjabay qarax..."" (Later reports said the plane was threatened with an explosion...).  This information is *added* in the later reports, meaning it wasn't in the *initial* report from Xinhua.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Diyaaradda ayaa ku caga dhigatay Ürümqi** - The passage states it was *denied* landing in Ürümqi.
*   **C: Diyaaradda ayaa loo weeciyay dhinaca dalka Afgaanistaan** - This is mentioned in both the initial and later reports.
*   **D: Diyaaradda ayaa ku caga dhigatay Kandahar** - This is also a detail shared in the later reports, not something missing from the first one.



"
Waa maxay waxa aan lagu sheegin warbixintii ugu horreysay ee wakaaladda cusub ee Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **D: Diyaaradda ayaa loogu hanjabay in la qarxini doono** (The plane was threatened with explosion).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Warar danbe ayaa sheegay in diyaarada loogu hanjabay qarax..."" (Later reports said the plane was threatened with explosion). This means the threat of a bomb was *not* in the initial report.

The other options *were* in the first report:

*   **A: Diyaaradda ayaa la afduubay** (The plane was hijacked) - This is the very first thing reported.
*   **B: Diyaaradda ayaa loo diiday inay si deg deg u degto** (The plane was denied emergency landing) - Mentioned in the first report.
*   **C: Diyaaradda ayaa dib loogu celiyay dalka Afgaanistaan** (The plane was diverted to Afghanistan) - Also mentioned in the first report.

Maxa ay ku dhawaaqday Sara Danius inta lagu guda jiray barnaamijka raadiyaha?,"The correct answer is **D: Guddigu waxay joojin doonaan dadaallada ay ku doonayaan inay xiriir la sameeyaan Bob Dylan**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Danius said, “iminkadan waxba ma sameyneyno” (currently we are doing nothing) and that they had made calls and sent messages but were stopping there (""tani waa wax nagu filan"" - this is enough for us).  This directly translates to them stopping their efforts to contact Bob Dylan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't say Danius announced Dylan *won* the prize on the radio, only that the committee was unable to reach him after his win.
*   **B:** The passage states they *received* good responses, not that they received no response.
*   **C:** The passage doesn't mention the other 2016 nominees."
Yaa awood loo yeelani waayay in la xiriiro?,"The correct answer is **D: Bob Dylan**.

The text explicitly states the committee was unable to reach **Bob Dylan** directly after his Nobel Prize win.  The quote, ""gudigu awoodi waayay inay si toos ah Bob Dylan ugala xiriiraan"" translates to ""the committee was unable to contact Bob Dylan directly."""
"""Yaa ka faallooday ballanqaadku inuu yahay """"tallaabo weyn""""?""","The correct answer is **C: Gordon Johndroe**.

The text states, ""Afhayen madaxweyne Bush Gordon Johndroe wuxuu ugu baaqay Waqoyiga Kuuriyo “ine cadeecan talaabooyinka waa weyn ee lagu garayo guulaha lagu xaqiijiyo joojinta isticmaalida nukliyeer ka dhulka Kuuriyo.”"" This means Gordon Johndroe is the one who used the phrase ""tallaabo weyn"" (large steps) in his statement.



"
Imisaa tiinbaro ayuu Slania uu uso saaray wadamada kala duwan?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku dhawaad 2,000**.

Here's why:

The text states Slania designed ""ilaa 1,000 calaamad boosto Sweden iyo 28 uu usoo saaray wadamo kale.""  1,000 + 28 = 1,028. ""Ku dhawaad 2,000"" is the closest option to this number.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, waa maxay sababta ay u badan tahay in ay sababtay in tuubada taangiga aay siiwado siidaaynta biyaha?","The correct answer is **C: Balaadhinta kulaylka (Thermal expansion)**.

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Ilaa galabnimadii Arbacada, burmadaha taangigu weli way liidayeen waxaana laga yaaba inay taas keentay kulka ku fiday gudaha taangiga."" (Until Wednesday afternoon, the ruptures in the tanks were still leaking and it is possible that this was caused by heat building up inside the tank.) This directly links the continued leaking to heat expansion within the tanks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aaga loo isticmalo kaydinta biyaha baylaha ah ayaa loo buuxinayaa si mug leh (The area used for storing bayl waters is being filled significantly):** The passage doesn’t mention any connection between bayl waters and the leak.
*   **B: Tijaabada joogtada ah ee nidaamka lagu mareeynayo dabka (The constant test of the system being subjected to fire):** The fire test *caused* the initial rupture, but doesn't explain why it's *still* leaking.
*   **D: Dab ka kacay mid ka mid ah saldhigyada bamka ee Fort Greely (A fire broke out in one of the Fort Greely bomb bases):** The text mentions a fire test nearby, but doesn’t state a fire actually broke out *at* Fort Greely that contributed to the leaking."
Waa maxay sababta loo furay mareenada lagu xakameeyo cadaadiska hawada?,"The correct answer is **A: Waxaa jiray balaadhin kuleyl ah oo ka dhacaayo gudaha taangiyada**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ilaa galabnimadii Arbacada, burmadaha taangigu weli way liidayeen waxaana laga yaaba inay taas keentay kulka ku fiday gudaha taangiga.""  This directly links the pressure relief valves opening to potential heat expansion *within* the tanks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Waxaa jiray cilad koronto ka dib tijaabada nidaamka:** The issue originated from a failed fire suppression system test, not an electrical fault.
*   **C: Taangiyada waxay ahaayeen kuwo buuxa:** While the tanks were large, the issue wasn't simply that they were full, but rather the pressure buildup due to heat.
*   **D: Goobta labaad ee loo adeegsado kaydinta ayaa hayn kari wayday foostooyin ku filan:** This refers to a separate storage vessel and doesn't explain why the relief valves opened on the initial tanks."
"Hadda, intee la’eg bay sarreeyaan biyaha Qaybta Sagaalaad?","The correct answer is **C: Dheerarka ila moxoga**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Degmada Ninth Ward ,taasoo la kulanatay fatahaad ilaa 20 cagood ah intii lagu jiray Duufaantii Katrina, ayaa hadda biyuhu u joogaan ilaa miskaha maadaama biyo fadhiisinka ku dhawaa fatahay."" This means the water is up to the ankles, suggesting it's a shallow depth *compared* to the devastating 20-foot floods of Katrina.  The text *doesn't* give a specific current depth, just a descriptive one (""ankle-deep"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dhererka 20 fiit (20 feet):** This is the height of the flooding during Katrina, not the current water level.
* **B: 6 inji (6 inches):** The passage only mentions 6 inches as the amount of rain that could cause the flooding to worsen, not the current water level.
* **D: Dhererka 100 fiit (100 feet):** The 100 steps refer to a mountain, and aren't relevant to the water level in the Ninth Ward.



"
"Intii lagu jiray Hurricane Katrina, maxaa ka dhacay Qaybta Sagaalaad?","The correct answer is **C: Biyaha daadku waxay ahaayeen 20 fiit**.

The passage specifically states: ""Degmada Ninth Ward ,taasoo la kulanatay fatahaad ilaa 20 cagood ah intii lagu jiray Duufaantii Katrina..."" which translates to ""The Ninth Ward district, which experienced flooding up to 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Biyaha daadku waxay ballac ahaan aay ahaayeen 100 fiit** - The passage mentions 100 talaabo (steps) of mountain, not 100 feet of flooding in the Ninth Ward.
*   **B: Biyihi dheerarku u gaarsiisnaa ila moxoga ayaa ka sare maray biyo dhigaalki loogu talagalay in lagu xakameeyo daadadka** - The passage doesn't mention breaching levees.
*   **D: 6 inji oo biyaha roobka ah ayaa jebiyey biyo dhigaalki waxyeelaysnaa ee loogu talagalay in lagu xakameeyo daadadka** - The passage states 6 inches of rain *could* contribute to flooding, but it doesn't say it broke levees or caused the Katrina flooding. The Katrina flooding was 20 feet high.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the patient *was* in Nigeria, where Ebola was present. It doesn't confirm *where* the patient traveled *from*. It simply states they had been *in* Nigeria.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Suurtagalnimada in bukaannada kale ay qaadaan fayraska:** The passage explicitly mentions measures to prevent spread, implying a concern about transmission.
*   **C: In maamuuska ama borotokoolka saxda ah la raacay:** The passage states the hospital *did* follow protocols for managing infectious diseases.
*   **D: Xaalada bukaanka ee uu hadda ku sugan yahay:** The passage states the patient was brought in with a ""stable"" condition.

Waa maxay waxa ay saynisyahannadu ay doonayaan inay ogaadaan?,"The correct answer is **D: Sida dhulka loo sameeyay** (How the Earth was formed).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Seynid yahanada waxa ay isku dayayaan in ay fahmaan sida ay meerayaasha u sameysmeen, siduu duunka usameysme, maadama dhagax meereye ay aduunka isku dhaceyn waqti hore.""  This translates to: ""Scientists are trying to understand how planets are formed, how the Earth was formed, as asteroids collided with the Earth in the past.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage mentions comets, but the focus is on understanding planet formation, not specifically what happens *when* a comet hits Earth.
*   **B:** While the passage mentions ""burutiin"" (proteins), the primary goal isn't understanding *how* proteins are made.
*   **C:** ""Maadada organic-ka"" (organic matter) is related, but not the central question scientists are pursuing according to the text.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, door intee le'eg ayuu booliiska deegaanka ka qaatay xidhitaanka?","The correct answer is **C: Waxay u jiheereen darawaliinta waddooyinka kale**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""80 booliis taageero ah oo baabuurleyda ku hagayay meelahay ka weecanayaan."" This directly means the police were directing drivers to alternative routes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waxay ku booriyeen FBI-da inay sameeyaan xidhitaanka** - The text says the FBI *urged* the Maryland Transportation Authority, not the other way around.
*   **B: Waxay goʼaansadeen inay xidhitaanka sameeyaan** - The text implies the Transportation Authority made the decision, prompted by the FBI, not the local police.
*   **D: Waxay ka warbixiyeen daahitaanka gaadiidka ee jidka kale** - The text doesn't mention the police reporting traffic delays on the other road. It says there *were no* reported delays.



"
Maxaa ku dhacay galitaanada tubada intii ay xirnaayeen?,"The correct answer is **A: Waxaay ahaayeen kuwa xidhan**.

The passage states, ""Iskarogooyin ayaa lagu gooyay iridda laga galo dhuunta,"" which translates to ""Barricades were used to block the tunnel entrances."" This directly means the tunnel entrances were closed.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage says traffic was *not* directed to the tunnel, implying it wasn't used as an alternate route.
* **C:** The barricades indicate they were *not* open to drivers.
* **D:** The passage doesn't mention any congestion, only the closure of the tunnel.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, waa maxay waxa aan dhicin ka hor inta uusan sawirqaaduhu gaadhigu ku dhicin?","The correct answer is **A: Sawir qaadaha ayaa waxaa amar ku siiyay ciidamada ilaalada wadooyinka in uu dib ugu laabto laamiga**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Marka loo eego bilayska, dirawalka baabuurka jiidhay sawir qaadahu waxaa suurta gal ah inaanu wajahin xukun danbiyeed."" This directly follows the information that the police ordered him to return to the curb *twice*.  This indicates he was initially told to go back.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** While the text mentions he parked near Sepulveda Boulevard, it doesn't say this happened *before* the incident.
*   **C:** The text says he *tried* to photograph the police barricade, but doesn't confirm he successfully did so *before* being told to move.
*   **D:** The text mentions Bieber's statement, but doesn't say the photographer actually got a picture of him.



"
Muxuu ahaa waxa uu sawir qaaduhu isku dayey inuu sameeyo ka hor inta aanu gaadhigu uu ku dhicin ama jiidhin?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka qaad sawiro goobta ay booliisku ku sugnaanyihiin**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""warbixin ayuu Bieber ku sheegay """"in kastoo aan joogin oo aanan si toos ahna faraba ugula jirin shilkan daran, waxaan tacsi iyo duco u dirayaa qoyska dulmanaha."""" Boggaga internetka wararka madadaalada TMZ ayaa fahansan in sawiraaga uu baaburkiisa ku joojiyay dhanka kale ee Sepulveda Boulevard ka dib **na isu dayay inuu sawiro isbaarada booliska** intuu wadada goynin oo na sii socdo...""

This clearly indicates the photographer attempted to photograph the police barricade."
Bayaankee ayaa si sax ah aan u sharaxaynin xaaladda madaxweynaha kadib markii laga helay fayraska?,"Jawabta saxda ah waa **A: Xaaladiisa caafimahad ma ahayn mid wanaagsan.**

Inkastoo Arias uu sheegay inuu fiicanyahay oo shaqadiisa qabsan karo, haddana bayaanka ayaa sheegaya inuu karantiil ku jiraa gurigiisa ""dhowr maalmood"" kadib markii laga helay virus. Karantiilada iyo jiritaanka viruska dhexda ma sheegayso xaalad caafimaad wanaagsan.

Halkan sababta jawaabaha kale aan loo dooran:

*   **B: Wuxuu qawaa cune xanuun oo cunaha aya nabarro kaso baxeen** - Bayaanka ma sheegin arrimahan.
*   **C: Waxa uu isagu ku sugan yahay xaalad deggan** - Bayaanka wuxuu dhihi karaa xaaladiisu waa ""mid dagan"", laakiin tani macnaheedu maaha in caafimaadkiisu yahay mid fiican.
*   **D: Waxaa haysto qandho** - Bayaanka ma sheegayo inuu qandho haysto, wuxuuna tilmaamayaa ""xummad iyo cuno xanuun""."

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Waxaanu rajaynayaa inaanu hawshayda kusoo laabto Isniinta,” ayuu ku yiray Arias bayaan."" This means he is able to communicate and issue statements, implying he has the capacity to use communication tools.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wax qandho ah ma haayso ama ma qawo** - The text only mentions ""xummad iyo cuno xanuun"" (fever and stomach pain), not any respiratory symptoms.
* **B: Waxa uu joogi doonaa guriga dhowr toddobaad** - The text says he will be quarantined ""dhowr malmood"" (a few days), not weeks.
* **D: Waxa uu ku suganyahay xaalad aad u daran oo uu ku keenay fayraska** - The text explicitly states his condition is ""mid dagan"" (stable) and he feels ""waan fayo qabaa oo waan fiicnahay"" (I am well and I am fine)."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Goorma ayaa la filayey in duufaanta kulaylaha Gonu ay sii daciifto ama aay sii yaraato?","The correct answer is **B: Marka dabaylaha ay hoos u dhacaan ilaa 83 kiilomitir saacadiiba**.

The text states: ""...iyadoo la filanaayo inay sii daciifto"" *after* mentioning the wind speed is 83 kilometers per hour. This directly links the weakening of the cyclone to the wind speed dropping to that level.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kahor inta aan la gaarin Maldives:** The text doesn't say *when* it will weaken, just that it *is* weakening.
*   **C: Inta aan la gaarin heerkii ugu sarreysay:** The text says it *reached* its peak, not that it will weaken before it.
*   **D: Ka hor inta aanan dabaylaha aaysan gaarin 149 mayl saacaddiiba:** The text says it reached 149 mph, then states it is expected to weaken. The weakening isn't tied to *not* reaching that speed, but to the wind speed being 83 km/h.



"
Sida ugu dhakhsa badnayd dabaylaha ku socday meesha ugu sarreysa duufaanta kulaylaha Gonu ?,"The correct answer is **A: 240 kiilomitir saacadiiba**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Markee ugu badneyd, duufanta Torobikalka ee Gonu... waxa ay gaarte 240 kiilomitir saacadii (149 meyl saacadii)"". This directly answers the question about the fastest wind speed within the cyclone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 240 mayl saacadiiba** - The text provides the speed in kilometers per hour *and* miles per hour (149 mph), so 240 mph is incorrect.
*   **C: 149 mayl saacadiib** - While 149 mph is mentioned, it's the equivalent of the peak speed, not the peak speed itself.
*   **D: 83 kiilomitir saacadiiba** - This refers to the sustained winds, not the maximum wind speed at the cyclone's peak.

Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan loo tixgelin inuu yahay sifada uu leeyahay Karenia brevis?,"Jawaabta saxda ah waa **C: Waa mid unugyo badan leh**.

Qoraalku si cad u sheegay in Karenia brevis ay tahay ""noole hal unugle"" (single-celled organism).  Sidaa darteed, ma ahan mid unugyo badan leh.

Halkan sababta jawaabaha kale ay yihiin kuwa sax ah:

*   **A: Waa nooc ka mid ah gufurka ama laweenta biyaha saarmo:** Qoraalku ku tilmaamayaa in Karenia brevis ay tahay ""aljahan,"" taas oo ah nooc ka mid ah gufurka biyaha.

*   **D: Waxay u dhacdaa si dabiici ah:** Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa in ""arrin dabiiciya"" ay tahay sababta keenta hirarka gaduudan."
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo uu Karena brevis uusan awoodin inuu sameeyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Si degdeg ah u kordhaayo tirada ahaan xaalad kasta**.

Here's why:

The passage states that *specific environmental conditions* allow *Karenia brevis* to bloom (increase in number). It doesn't say it can grow rapidly in *any* condition.  It needs favorable factors to flourish.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Neerfaha aan shaqaynaynin ee kalluunka** - The passage directly states the algae produces neurotoxins that disrupt nerve function in both humans and fish.
*   **C: Saamee biyaha** - The passage states the toxins accumulate in the water, affecting the water quality.
*   **D: So saar sunta burburisa neerfaha unugyada** - The passage says the algae produces neurotoxins (nerve-disrupting poisons).

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan u dhicin natiijada duufaanta Felicia?","The correct answer is **D: Daadadka waddooyinka**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states, ""aan wax dhaawacyo ama daadad ah aan la soo werin"" (no injuries or flooding have been reported). This directly contradicts the possibility of flooding on the roads.

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned or implied in the text:

*   **A: Faa’idada walxaha cirka ka imaada sida roobk iyo barafka:** The passage uses the word ""faaiido"" to describe the rainfall.
*   **B: Roob uu waheliyo ama uu la socdo onkod:** The text mentions ""duufano iyo hilaacyo joogta"" accompanied the rain.
*   **C: Hillaac iska so daba noqnoqonaayo:** The text also mentions ""duufano iyo hilaacyo joogta"" which can imply lightning.



"
Bayaankee ku saabsan Duufaanta Felicia ayaa been ah oo aan sax ahayn?,"The correct answer is **A: Roobabka ka dhashay ayaay ka faa'iidaysatay Oahu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the rain *reached* 6.34 inches and was *described* as ""beneficial"". This doesn't mean Oahu *benefited* from the storm itself, but that the rain that fell was considered helpful. 

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **B: Waxa markii kowaad loo kala saaray in aay tahay kulayl niyad-jab ka hor inta aanay isu rogin duufaanta Qaybta 4** - The passage states Felicia *was* a Category 4 hurricane and *weakened* to a tropical storm.
*   **C: Inta badan jasiiradaha waxaa ka dhacay walxaha cirka ka imaada sida roobk iyo barafka** - The passage states the remnants brought rain that fell across most of the island.
*   **D: Roobabka qaar ayaa waxaa weheliyay oo la socday hillaac** - The passage explicitly states ""Some of the rain was accompanied by thunder and lightning.""



"
Bayaankee si sax ah uga tarjumaysa natiijada Hungarian Grand Prix ee 2009?,"The correct answer is **C: Piquet Jr. ayaa markii dambe la eryay** (Piquet Jr. was later fired).

Here's why:

The text states ""Piquet Jr. Ayaa shaqada laga saaray taratanka Hungarian Grand Prix dhacay 2009 ka dib."" (Piquet Jr. was fired from the Hungarian Grand Prix that took place in 2009).  This directly answers the question about the result of the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix *for Piquet Jr.*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fernando Alonso ayaa waxa uu galay shil** (Fernando Alonso was involved in an accident) - The text mentions an incident with Alonso in 2008, not 2009.
*   **B: Piquet Jr. ayaa qaaday guusha** (Piquet Jr. won) - The text states he was fired, not that he won.
*   **D: Gaariga badbaadada ama amaanka ayaa galay shil** (The safety car was involved in an accident) - The text only mentions the safety car being deployed due to an earlier incident, not being *in* an accident.



"
Goorma ayuu shilku dhacay?,"The correct answer is **A: Isla markiiba kadib marki gaariga Alonso la joojiyay halka gaariga tartamaha lagu hagaajiyo**.

Here's why:

The passage states Piquet Jr. crashed *after* briefly stopping Fernando Alonso, and then the crash happened near the fuel spill while Alonso was driving towards the pit lane for repairs. This directly corresponds to option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage says the fuel spill was *where* the crash happened, not where it happened *before*.
*   **C:** The crash happened *after* the safety car came out.
*   **D:** Piquet Jr.'s crash caused the situation, he didn't crash while *getting* fuel."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Kuwa soo socda kee baa qaatay wakhti ka yar intii ay cilmi-baarayaashu markii hore aay rumaysnaayeen?","Jawabtu saxda ah waa **A: Samaaynta noocyada sinjiyada**.

Sababta: Qoraalka ayaa sheegay in cilmi-baarayaashu ay ""soo wariyeen noocyo cusub oo saamayn ku leh kaliya laba jiil,"" taas oo macnaheedu yahay in noocyadani ay soo sameeyeen wakhti ka yar intii ay markii hore rumaysnaayeen. ""Samaaynta noocyada"" waa habka ay noocyadu u soo saaraan wakhti yar, sidaa darteed waa jawaabta ugu dhabta ah ee ka soo baxda qoraalka.

Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda ee aysan cilmi-baarayaashu soo sheegin?,"The correct answer is **C: Magaca sinjiyada cusub**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Halkaas oo noocyada sinjiyada cusub laga sameeyay** - The passage clearly states the new species were found on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
*   **B: Inta muda ee uu qaatay geedi socodka tadawurka** - The passage states the species evolved in just two generations, which is information about the timeframe.
*   **D: Shimbiraha ka qayb qaatay gedi socodka taranka** - The passage identifies *Geospiza fortis* and *Geospiza conirostris* as the finches involved.
*   **C: Magaca sinjiyada cusub** - The passage only says ""nooc cusub oo shimbiro ah"" (a new type of finch) and doesn't give a specific name for the new species.

Therefore, the passage does *not* reveal the name of the new finch species."
Xagee ka dhici doontaa munaasabada fanka dadweynaha ee CowParade?,"The correct answer is **B: Magaalada Bucharest**.

The text explicitly states that Bucharest will be the first city in Southeastern Europe to host CowParade. The other options are either too broad (C), inaccurate (A & D)."
Keebaa weedhahan soo socda si sax ah u qeexaya munaasabada fanka dadweynaha ee CowParade?,"Jawabtu saxda ah waa **D: Waa dhacdadii ugu ballaarneyd ee fanka dadweynaha adduunka**.

Maxaa sababay in Ruushku uu joojiyo isticmaalka II-76s?,"The correct answer is **B: Shilka**.

Here's why:

The text states that Russia ""briefly grounded Il-76s *after* that accident"" (referring to the October 7th incident). This directly links the grounding to the accident/crash.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ciidamada gudaha:** While internal forces were involved in investigating, they didn't *cause* the grounding.
*   **C: Ciidankii Soofiyeetiga:** The Soviet military's use of the plane isn't relevant to *why* it was grounded now.
*   **D: Baaritaan la sugaayo:** The investigation happened *because* of the crash, it wasn’t the reason for the grounding itself.



"
Waa maxay II-76?,"The correct answer is **C: Diyaarad**.

The text explicitly states ""Il-76 wuxu qayb wayn ka ahaa milatariga Ruushka iyo Sofiyeetka labadaba"" which translates to ""Il-76 has been a major part of the Russian and Soviet militaries"". This clearly identifies Il-76 as an aircraft (diyaarad).

Yaa shaqaaleysiiyay kooxda qoraayaasha ah ee Simpsons?,"The correct answer is **D: Groening**.

The passage states: ""In 1989 he helped create The Simpsons, with Brooks and Groening being responsible for hiring the show’s first writing staff."" 

Therefore, Groening (along with Brooks) was responsible for hiring the writing staff."
"Sida laga soo xigtay Fluke, yaa soo diri jiray ayada faallooyinka wanaagsan iyo dhiirigelinta?","The correct answer is **D: Shakhsiyaadyada lab iyo dhedig labadaba**.

The text states Fuluuk received ""fikrado wanaagsan oo ay ku dhiiro galiyeen rag iyo dumarba"". This directly translates to ideas and encouragement from both men and women.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxay dadka qaarkiis aay u diidaan in dumarku ay si fiican wax walbo uga hadlaan?","The correct answer is **A: Shakhsiyaadka ragga ah (Men)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Fuluuk's work reveals efforts to *silence women's voices* regarding women's health, and that she reached this conclusion after receiving input from both men and women who suggested framing contraception as essential health. This implies some men are part of the effort to suppress discussion about women's health issues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kharashaadka ku baxa caafimahadka (Healthcare Costs):** The passage doesn't mention cost as a reason for silencing women.
* **C: Caafimaadka haweenka (Women's Health):**  The passage argues *about* women's health, it doesn't say it's the reason for the resistance.
* **D: Wax si Nasiib ah ku dhaco (Random Occurrences):** The passage points to deliberate efforts to silence, not random events.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, qaybaha merayaasha keebaa ugu firfircoon?","The correct answer is **A: Dhulka**.

The passage states: ""waxaa jiro keliya jir mere kaas oo muujinayo firfircooni badan oo kala duwan marka loo eego Titan, magaciisuna waa Dhul.” This directly translates to ""there is only one mere body that shows much more variation in activity compared to Titan, and its name is Earth."" Therefore, Earth is the most active.
"
Waa maxay nooca meeraha oo ka kooban dareere hufan ayaa laga helay webiyada iyo harooyinka?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan-ka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...waxaa jiro keliya jir mere kaas oo muujinayo firfircooni badan oo kala duwan marka loo eego Titan..."" This directly links the liquid (implied to be water-like based on the comparison to water) with Titan. The passage implies Titan is unique in having this liquid activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cirjeex (Mercury)** - Mercury is a rocky planet and extremely hot, not known for liquid water.
*   **C: Qorraxda (The Sun)** - The Sun is a star, made of plasma, not liquid.
*   **D: Raage (Mars)** - While Mars *may* have subsurface ice and some evidence of past water, the passage specifically points to Titan as the one with active liquid.



"
Maxaa ka mid ah natiijooyinkan aan ahayn natiijada laga helay baaritaanka lagu sameeyay baalasha?,"The correct answer is **A: Midabka lakabka baalasha qurxoon ee xayawaanka**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Aqoonyahanada sayniska ayaa sheegaan in dufka xayawaankani uu kor ka ahaa midab kafe hoosna ka ahaa midib furan ama midib cas.""  This information about the color of the feathers is described as ""macluumaad aan caam ahayn"" and not directly a finding *from* the analysis of the wings themselves. It's an additional piece of information scientists believe to be true, but it wasn't *discovered* by studying the wing structure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fahamka ah in baalasha aan loo isticmaalin duulimaadka ama buubitaanka:** This understanding *is* a direct result of examining the wing structure. The passage says the wing structure indicates they weren't used for flight, but for temperature regulation or display.
* **C: Aragtida dhabta ah ee Taadawurka ku dhaca baalasha:** The passage discusses how feathers (rajis) may have evolved from other structures (barbis and barbaluus), which is a result of the wing analysis.
* **D: Xaqiijinta in xayawaanada qiroweyn badankooda ay lahaayeen baalal:** While the passage talks about dinosaurs and wings, it doesn't claim to *confirm* most scaled animals had wings – it's about understanding the function and evolution of *these specific* wings.



"
Waa maxay waxa aan baalasha xayawaanka qiroweyn uusan lahayn?,"The correct answer is **A: Garabyada baalasha**.

The text specifically states: ""Maadaama baalasha dhaynasooradu aanay lahayn dacallo si fiican u samaysan, ee loo yaqaan raajis...""  ""Dacallo"" refers to the feather vanes or barbs that make up the flight surface of a bird's wing.  The passage contrasts this with the structures found on the dinosaur wings - *baarbis iyo baarbaluus*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: qaybta sare ee usha baalasha** - The text doesn't mention anything about the upper part of the wing's surface.
*   **C: Bbaalasha shimbiraha waaweeyn** - The passage is *comparing* dinosaur wings to bird wings, not saying dinosaur wings lack large bird wings.
*   **D: Midab barax ah oo ka qaybta hoosee** - The text discusses the colors *of* the dinosaur skin (dark on top, lighter/reddish below), but doesn't say the wings lacked color.

Keebaa weedhaha soo socda ee ku saabsan ZMapp aan run ahayn?,"Jawabtu saxda ah waa **B: Unugyada difaaca jirka ayaa awood u leh inay daaweeyaan caabuqyada jira laakiin kama hortagayaan dhimashada.**

Halkan sababta:

*   Qoraalka ayaa sheegaya in illaa haatan dawo ku habboon daaweynta caabuqyada jiray aan la helin, iyo in ZMapp ay ka faa'ido yar tahay dhimasha ka hortaga laga rabay. Taas micnaheedu ma ahan inuu daweeyo caabuqyada jira, balse waxaa laga yaabaa inuu wax u qabto.

Halkan sababta jawabaha kale ay yihiin kuwo sax ah:

*   **A: Waxay ka samaysan tahay unugyada difaaca jirka:** Qoraalka ayaa sheegaya in ZMapp ay tahay ""isku darka halka antibody,"" kuwaas oo ka yimid nidaamka difaaca jirka.
*   **C: Waxaay u shaqaaysay sidi xakamaynta Tijaabada PALM:** Qoraalku wuxuu sheegaa in ZMapp ay u shaqeysay ""sidi maamul ahaan"" tijaabada PALM, taas oo macnaheedu ahayd in loo isticmaalo sidii xakamayn.
*   **D: Daraasaduhu waxay muujinayaan in faa'iidooyinkeedu ay ka yar yihiin sidii markii hore loo maleynayay:** Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa in baadhiso rasmi ah ay soo saartay in ZMapp ay ""ka faaiido yar tahay dhimasha ka hortaga laga rabay."""
Teeba ka mid ah bayaanada soo socda oo si sax ah u qeexaya tijaabada PALM?,"The correct answer is **C: ZMapp ayaa waxa loo adeegsaday gundhigga tijaabada**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Bilowgi PALM, ZMapp waxay u shaqeysay maamul ahaan, micnaheeduna waa saynis yahanadu waxay u isticmaalaan asas ahaan si la isu bar bar dhigo sadexda dhaqan ee kale.""  This directly means ZMapp was used as a baseline or control for comparison in the PALM trial.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage says ZMapp had *less* benefit than hoped for, not more.
*   **B:** While it was compared to other treatments, the passage specifically states ZMapp *was* the control, not just *one of* the treatments being compared.
*   **D:** The passage explicitly states a suitable treatment *hasn't* been clearly identified yet, and ZMapp's effectiveness was found to be limited.

Halkee ayay cilmi-baarayaashu u maleynayaan in qaybta jabka yar ee cusub uu noqon doono kan ugu muhiimsan?,"The correct answer is **A: Wadamada dakhligoodu hooseeyo**

The text states the new device could help patients in low-income countries where cancer rates are significantly higher than in wealthier nations. This makes it the most likely place where the device will be most impactful."
Qaabkee loo isticmaali doonaa si loo hagaajiyo qalabka loo adeegsado ogaanshaha ama baaritaanka?,"The correct answer is **C: Chips-ka la daabici karo**.

Here's why:

The passage states the new device is ""scalable and manufacturable, potentially allowing it to be deployed across the U.S. and globally."" This suggests it's not a simple, low-cost reagent (like a cent - option A) nor existing equipment (like inkjet printers or other testing devices - options B & D). Instead, it’s a new *physical component* – a chip – that can be produced and distributed widely. The ability to be “printed” implies it's created using a process similar to chip manufacturing, fitting the description of ""printable chips.""

"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, bayaankee ku saabsan dilaacyada lobate-ka ee dayaxa ayan run ahayn?","The correct answer is **A: Dhacdooyinka keenay dilaacyada lobate-ka in aay dhaco waxay u badan tahay inay dhowaan dhaceen.**

Here's why:

The passage states the lobate scarps *appear to be the result of the moon shrinking over time*. This implies the formation of these features was a gradual process related to a long-term change (the moon getting smaller), not a recent event.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **B:** The passage explicitly states the scarps *demonstrate the geological activity* the moon has undergone.
*   **C:** The passage directly links the scarps to the *moon gradually shrinking*.
*   **D:** The passage says scientists *have seen* these features on the moon, meaning they exist and have been observed.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Aragtidee ku saabsan qaab-dhismeedka dhulka ayaa tilmaamaysa in uu jiro dhaqdhaqaaq juqraafiga ah oo ka dhacaya dayaxa?","The correct answer is **A: Dayaxu si tartiib ah ayeey u sii yaraanaysaa.**

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Saynisyahanadu waxay dayaxa oogadiisa ku arkeen qaab dhuleed ku daadsan kuwaasoo loo yaqaan haraayada loobayt kuwaaso sida muuqata ka dhashay dayaxa oo si tartiiba u soo yaraaday.""  This directly translates to ""Scientists have seen landforms on the moon's surface that are called lobate scarps, which appear to have formed as the moon slowly shrank.""

This indicates ongoing geological activity *because* the shrinking moon is causing these landforms to appear.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Qaab-dhismeedka dhulka waxaa la abuuray ama la hagaajiyay waqti dheer ka hor** - While the passage implies the features *result* from earlier shrinking, it doesn't say they were formed a long time ago; the shrinking process is ongoing.
*   **C: Waxaa jira oo keliya tiro yar oo ka mid ah qaab-dhismeedyada dhulka oo ku yaalo oogada dayaxa** - The passage doesn't mention the *number* of landforms, just that they are present.
*   **D: qaab-dhismeedyada waxaa la hagaajiyay ama la sameeyay qiyaas ahaan dhawaan** - The passage says they are forming as the moon shrinks, implying an ongoing process, not a recent event.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaase dheeraad ah oo aan dhici doonin ilaa dacwadda lagu soo oogo?","The correct answer is **B: Daabacaada sawirka**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Xafiiska korown, kaasi oo ah meesha ka dhacdo go'aanka maxkadaynta,ayaa u muujiyay saxafiyiinta joornaalada in aanay jirin doonin waxdanbe oo ka go'naansho ah ugu yaraan tan iyo inta laga gaadhayo eedaynta."" This means no further release of images will happen *until* the indictment is reached.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Faallooyin dheeraad ah:** The text doesn't suggest any restriction on further comments.
*   **C: Wadahadalada caddaynta markhaatiga goob jooga ah:** The text mentions issues with witness testimony but doesn't indicate a halt to *discussions* about it.
*   **D: Daabacaada Qorallada:** The text doesn't mention anything about the publication of notes or documents.

"
Caqiidadee ayuu Roberts ka gaabsaday inuu ansixiyo?,"The correct answer is **C: Bilawga nolosha**.

Here's why:

The passage states Robert refused to discuss *when he believes life begins* (""ayuu u diiday in uu ka hadlo marka uu aminsan yahay inay nolasha bilaabato""). This is the core of the ethical debate around abortion, and he explicitly avoided taking a position on it, calling it ""immoral"" to offer an opinion where there is belief involved. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Muhiimadda xukunnada aay sameeeyso maxkamadda sare ee joogtada ah:** He *reiterated* the importance of the Supreme Court’s precedent.
* **B: Ka hadalka kiiska anshax ahaan:** He did engage in discussing the ethical implications, just not the specific point of when life begins.
* **D: Xuquuqda qarsoodiga shaqsiga:** He *confirmed* his belief in the right to privacy.



"
Mawduucee ayuu Roberts uu dareemay inuu yahay mid aad u xun anshax ahaan in laga hadlo?,"The correct answer is **D: Waxyaabaha gaarka ah ee kiisaska**.

Here's why:

The text states Robert refused to comment ""when he believes life begins,"" describing it as ""immoral to offer opinions on matters of faith."" This directly refers to the deeply personal and ethically sensitive nature of *when* life begins – a private belief.  He felt it was anshax ahaan xun (immoral) to discuss this specific area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Joogteynta Xukunnada aay samayso Maxkamadda Sare** - He emphasized the importance of the Court's rulings being settled, but didn't describe discussing that as unethical.
*   **B: Go'aanka Roe v. Wade** - He reaffirmed his support for Roe v. Wade, he didn't say discussing it was unethical.
*   **C: Xuquuqda sida dahsoon u sheegida qarsoodiga shaqsiga** - He affirmed his belief in the right to privacy, but didn't say talking about it was immoral.



"
Aaway labada xabo ee ahaa fallaadhaha iftiinka ee iftiimayay?,"The correct answer is **A: Dhanka samada ama cirka**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Labo koox iftiin leer ayaa kor loo taagay si aay hawada sare u qabtaan habeenki.""  This directly means the lights were pointed *upwards* towards the sky to illuminate the air.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Magaalada oo dhan:** The text says they are aiming *up*, not illuminating the whole city.
*   **C: Bartilmaameedka dayuurada yar ee ugu horreeysa:** The text doesn't mention airplanes or targets.
*   **D: Dhex bartanka beerta xusuusta:** The text states the lights were to illuminate the *air* (hawada sare), not a specific location on the ground.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Goorma ayaa dhismayaalka cusub ee aadka u dheer laga dhisay goobta?","The correct answer is **D: Dhismuhu wuu socdaa** (The construction is ongoing).

Here's why:

The text states ""Dhismaha ayaa u socdo shan dabaq oo cusub goobta..."" which directly translates to ""Construction is underway for five new floors on the site..."".  This indicates the construction is *currently* happening, not that it happened at a specific time in the past.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bartamihii maalinta** (Midday) - The text doesn't mention construction happening specifically at midday.
*   **B: 8:46 subaxnimo.** (8:46 am) - While 8:46 am is mentioned, it refers to the time the city ""woke up"" (shib tidhi) and is related to the first breeze, not the construction.
*   **C: Habeenka gudihiisa** (Within the night) - The text mentions lights being raised to capture the air *at night*, but not that construction is happening *during* the night.



"
Macluumaadkee ayaa tilmaamaya in Toddobada walaalo (xidigaha ururta) ay godad yihiin?,"The correct answer is **A: Kala duwanaanshaha heerkulka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Muuqaalada iftiinka leh waxay ku tusayaan kala duwanaanshaha heerkulka laga bilaabo habeen iyo maalin waxayna ku tusinayaan inay yelankaran godad."" This directly links temperature variation to the identification of the Seven Sisters (Pleiades) as craters.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dhexroorka afka godka laga galo:** The passage mentions the diameter/circumference (100-250 meters) but doesn't say this *proves* they are craters, it's just a characteristic.
*   **C: Sahannada juqraafiyeed:** The passage does not mention geographical locations.
*   **D: Sawirrada godadka ku yaala dhulka:** The passage contrasts these craters to larger, more stable craters on Earth, not that pictures of Earth craters confirm the Pleiades are craters.



"
Sidee lagu arkay habdhaqanka kulaylka ee Toddobada Walaalo?,"The correct answer is **A: Infrared-ka sawiraanta**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Muuqaalada iftiinka leh waxay ku tusayaan kala duwanaanshaha heerkulka laga bilaabo habeen iyo maalin waxayna ku tusinayaan inay yelankaran godad.""  ""Muuqaalada iftiinka leh"" refers to infrared imaging, which detects temperature differences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Godadka qootada dheer ee dhulka ku yaalla:** While the passage *describes* the Seven Sisters as long, narrow shafts, it doesn't say this is *how* their temperature behavior was observed.
* **C: Dhexroorka godadka:** The passage mentions the diameter of the pits, but not as a method for detecting temperature changes.
* **D: Sahamisyada godadka dhulka ku yaala:** This is a general statement about pits and isn't how the temperature behavior was discovered.

Halkan sababta:

*   Tuduca ayaa sheegaya in ninka lagu eedeeyo inuu gaariga *soo dhex dhigay* dadka, ma uu wadin.
*   Tuduca wuxuu ka sheegay in waxyaal badan oo qarxa ay ku jireen gaariga

*   Tuduca wuxuu sheegay inuu u qarxiyey, sidaa darteed B waa run.

"
Maxaa macluumaad ah oo la xiriira weerarka oo ay maamulka xaqiijiyeen?,"The correct answer is **B: Qowmiyada uu ka soo jeedo qofka Tuhmanaha ah**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states, ""Maamuladu magaciisa ma yaqaaniin ilaa hadda, in kastoo ay og yihiin inuu xubin ka yahay qawmiyadda Uighur."" This means the authorities *have confirmed* the suspect's ethnicity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aqoonsiga cid kasta oo ku lug lahayd** - The passage only mentions one suspect, and doesn't confirm the identity of anyone involved.
*   **C: Ujeedada ka danbeysay weerarka in uu dhaco** - The passage does not mention the motive for the attack.
*   **D: Magaca koowaad iyo kan dambe ee qofka tuhmanaha ah** - The passage explicitly states they *do not* know the suspect's name yet.



"
Waa kuwee kooxaha ciyaaraya kulanka ka dhici doona Garoonka Ellis Park?,"The correct answer is **C: Koonfur Afrika iyo Australia** (South Africa and Australia).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Cayaarta fiinalka waxa ay ka dhici doonta Ellis Park ee Johannesburg isbuuca xiga marka Springboks ay Australia ku cayaaran."" 

*   ""Springboks"" is a nickname for the South African rugby team.
*   The text clearly says they will be playing *Australia*.

Therefore, the final match at Ellis Park will be between South Africa and Australia.



"
Halkee ayay Springboks’ ku ciyaari doonaan kulankooda xiga?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

The text states: ""Cayaarta fiinalka waxa ay ka dhici doonta Ellis Park ee Johannesburg isbuuca xiga marka Springboks ay Australia ku cayaaran."" This directly indicates the next game will be in Johannesburg."
Keebaa kuwan soo socda ay dhibaato kala kulmeen dayax-gacmeedka weyn oo macmalka ah ee ah saldhigga hawada sare intii lagu guda jiray howlgalka?,"The correct answer is **B: Xakamaynta birta wareegsata ee gyroscope-ka**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Xarrunta hawadda ayaa ilaalinaysay aragtideeda, in kasta oo ay ku dhacday gryocope hore hawlihii saldhiga..."" This directly translates to ""The airbase was maintaining its vision, even though it experienced a gyroscope malfunction."" 

The question asks about the trouble encountered with the space station.  The gyroscope malfunction is the specific problem described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ilaalinta masaafada saxda ah ee aalada aay isticmalaan dayaxgacmeedyada ee thrusters-ka** - The text mentions maintaining safe distances from maneuvering thrusters, but this wasn't a *problem* they encountered, just something they were aware of.
*   **C: Dhaqdhaqaajinta dayuurada** - The text mentions Russian ground control launching jets, but this was a corrective action, not a problem.
*   **D: Dib u helitaanka sarreynta hawada caadiga ah** - The text says they regained normal station operations *after* the problems, not that there was trouble with regaining them.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxay ahayd hadafka saldhiga hawada sare?","The correct answer is **C: Dhameystirka socodka hawada sare (Completing a spacewalk)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the airlock was used ""until the end of the spacewalk."" This directly indicates the purpose of the station at that time was to facilitate a spacewalk.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Helitaanka birta wareegsata ee gyroscope-ka (Retrieving a spinning piece of the gyroscope):** The passage mentions a gyroscope *issue* but not a retrieval attempt.
*   **B: Kusii dhawaanaya isku hagaajinta aalada aay isticmalaan dayaxgacmeedyada ee thrusters-ka (Approaching alignment of the lunar lander thrusters):** There is no mention of lunar landers or thrusters.
*   **D: Dhaqdhaqaajinta ama ka shaqaysiinta diyaaradaha (Activating or operating aircraft):** The passage mentions Russian ground control launching aircraft, but this doesn't relate to the *station's* purpose.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Kooxdee ayuu Vidal bilaabay inuu u ciyaaro seddex xilli ciyaareed ka hor?","The correct answer is **C: Barça**.

The text states ""28-year-old Vidal joined Barça three seasons ago, coming from Sevilla."" This directly states he began playing for Barça three seasons ago.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sevilla** - He came *from* Sevilla, but didn't start playing for them three seasons ago.
*   **B: Catalan** - Catalan is a region/city, not a football club.
*   **D: Caasimada** - This means ""capital city"" and refers to Barcelona, not a team.



"
Imisa kulan ayuu Vidal u ciyaaray Barça?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ka dib intuu u guuray caasimadda Catalan, Vidal ayaa kooxda u ciyaaray 49 ciyaar."" (After moving to the Catalan capital, Vidal played 49 games for the team.)"
Yaa ahaa kooxdii ka soo horjeeday ciyaarta?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

The text states Jarque was preparing for a game *against* Bolonia. The other options are either people (Jarque) or places (Coverciano, Italy)."
Maxay ahayd sababta Jarque uu u joogay hudheelka?,"The correct answer is **C: Wuxuu kulan lahaa maalinta Axada** (He had a match on Sunday).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states he was staying at the hotel ""ka hor kulanka kooxda loo qorsheeyay ciyaarta axada ay la yeelanayaan Bolonia"" - meaning before the match scheduled for Sunday against Bologna. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wuxuu lahaan tababar** (He had training) - While he was *before* training at Coverciano, the reason for staying at *this* hotel was the match.
* **B: Wuxuu lahaa kulanka xili ciyareedka ka horeeya** (He had a pre-season match) - The text doesn't say it's a pre-season match, just a match on Sunday.
* **D: Waxa uu tababar la qaadanayay Bolonia** (He was training with Bologna) - He's playing *against* Bologna, not training with them.

Maxay hay'adda jakarta ee cilmiga geophysics-ka u soo saari waysay digniin?,"The correct answer is **D: Ma ayna buuxinin baaxadda looga baahnaa dhulgariiirada** (It didn't meet the necessary earthquake magnitude).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Wax digid tsunami lama soo saarin, marka la fiiryo hayada dhulkiyo qaabeynta, wax digitaan tsunami lama sheegi doono maadama uu aad uuga yaran doono heer dhibato dhacdo.""  This directly translates to ""A tsunami warning was not issued, considering the earthquake's characteristics, a tsunami warning will not be issued because it is too small to reach a dangerous level.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ma jirin wax halis ama khatar ah oo ah moowjka ama hirka biyaha:** (There was no danger from waves or rising water) While true *as a result* of the earthquake, this isn't *why* the warning wasn't issued.  The warning wasn't issued because they assessed the earthquake wasn't strong enough to create a dangerous tsunami.
* **B: Si looga fogaado argagaxa ku dhacay dadka deegaanka:** (To avoid panic among local people) This is a possible consideration in general, but the text focuses on the *scientific* reason for not issuing a warning.
* **C: Si looga fogaado saameyn ku yeelashada ganacsiyada maxaliga ah:** (To avoid impacting local businesses) This is a less likely reason for a scientific agency to withhold a legitimate warning.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaa uu sababay dhulgariirka?","Jawaabta saxda ah waa **B: Khatarta moowjyada ama hirarka**.

Sababta: Qoraalka wuxuu sheegayaa in dadku ay ka carareen ganacsigooda iyo guryahooda sababtoo ah **suurtagalnimada khatar suunaami**. Tani waxay muujineysaa in khatarta moowjyada (ama hirarka) ay tahay waxa sababay in dadku ay ka guureen.

*   **D: 6.5 oo ah qiyaasta cabirka baaxada dhulgariirka:** Cabirka dhulgariirka la sheegay ma sababeyso dadka inay ka cararaan; khatarta suunaamiga ayaa ah sababta."
Keeba ka mid ah kuwan oo sabab u ah dhaqdhaqaaqa qorraxda iyo dhamaan xiddigaha kale?,"The correct answer is **D: Iftiinka Luminosity-ga, Lambarka Rossy, iyo wareega**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Iftiinka iyo wareega ayaa la wada adeegsadaa si loo go'aansado Rossy lambarka xiddigta, kaasoo la xiriira qulqulka balaasmada.""  This directly links these three factors to stellar activity.
* **Rossby number** is described as being related to the dynamics of the plasma (and thus activity).
* **Luminosity (Iftiinka)** is a fundamental property of stars related to energy output and therefore activity.
* **Rotation (Wareega)** is also a key driver of stellar activity, generating magnetic fields.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While luminosity and plasma flow are *involved*, they don't represent the full picture as the passage details.
* **B:** Mentions planetary magnetic changes which aren't discussed in the passage as a cause of stellar activity.
* **C:**  Missing the crucial link – the Rossby number – which ties luminosity and rotation to the dynamics of the star.



"
Sidee loo go'aamiyaa lambarka Rossby ee xiddiga?,"The correct answer is **A: Iftiinka Luminosity-ga iyo wareega**.

The passage states: ""Iftiinka iyo wareega ayaa la wada adeegsadaa si loo go'aansado Rossy lambarka xiddigta..."" which directly translates to ""Light and rotation are both used to determine the Rossby number of a star...""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Qadarka qulqulka balasmaha (Amount of plasma flow):** While plasma flow is *related* to the Rossby number, it's not directly used to *determine* it according to the text.
* **C: Heerka waxqabadka (Efficiency level):** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Qadarka isbadalada magnetic-ka ee meerayaasha (Amount of magnetic changes in planets):** The passage discusses the star's magnetism, not planets.

(Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia can become a Republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.)"
Ururkee baa baadhista sharciga ah aay ku socotaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Waalidnimada la qorsheeyay (Planned Parenthood)**.

Here's why:

The text states that Representative Cliff Stearns is investigating ""how Planned Parenthood spends and reports its money"" and whether tax dollars were used for abortions. This clearly indicates the investigation is focused on Planned Parenthood.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tamarta aqalka iyo Guddiga ganacsiga (House Energy and Commerce Committee)** - This committee is where Stearns holds a position and *oversees* the investigation, but it is not the subject of the investigation.
*   **B: Komen Foundation** - The Komen Foundation *stopped funding* Planned Parenthood because of the investigation, but isn't being investigated itself.
*   **D: Kormeerka iyo gudiga hoose ee Baaritaanada (Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee)** - Similar to A, this is the subcommittee Stearns chairs and handles the investigation, but it isn't the target."
Guddigee ayuu Cliff Stearns madax ka yahay?,"The correct answer is **D: Kormeerka iyo gudiga hoose ee Baaritaanada**.

The text states: ""Stearns waxa uu baadhis ku wadaa...iyadoo loo sii Planned Parenthood iyo doorkiisa guddoomiyenimo Guddi Hoosaadka Kormeerka iyo Baarista, taasoo hoos tagta dallada Tamarta Aqalka iyo Guddida Ganacsiga.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Alaabteedii la xaday ayaa dib loo soo helay** - While her belongings *were* recovered, this isn't what happened *to her*.
*   **B: Waa la dilay** - The text doesn't mention she was killed.
*   **D: Taleefankeedii iyo Laptop-keedii ayaa la xaday** - This is true, but it's a consequence of the primary event, not the event itself. The main event is the rape."
Shirkadee ayaa la siiyay abaalmarinta joogtada ah ee Taiwan Sustainable Award ee 2007?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The passage explicitly states that ""ASUS was awarded the Taiwan Sustainable Award by the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China.""
"
Waa maxay ASUS Eee PC?,"The correct answer is **B: Waa kombuyuutar laptop ah**.

The text specifically states ""waxa uu noqday mowduuc xasaasi sanadkii 2007 Taipei IT Bisha"" (it became a sensitive topic at the 2007 Taipei IT Month) and refers to it as a ""kombiyuutarda laabtoobku"" (laptop computer). Therefore, it is a laptop computer."
Yaa mas'uul ka ahaa waraaqihii boostada ee la waayay?,"The correct answer is **C: Wiil**.

The passage explicitly states that ""a boy hid 600 postal documents, including 429 New Year's greeting cards, which were not delivered to the intended recipients."" This directly identifies the boy as responsible for the missing postal materials.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, yaa daabacay raaligalinta la xiriirta dukumentiyada maqan?","The correct answer is **D: Xafiiska boostada Obanazawa**.

The passage states: ""Shalayto, xafiiska boostada ayaa raaligelin u soo diray muwaadiniinta iyo saxaafadda..."" This directly indicates the post office issued the apology.



"
Goorma ayuu Del Potro u baahday inuu wax ka qabto arrinta garabkiisa?,"The correct answer is **A: Inta lagu guda jiray wareegii ugu horeeyay**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Del Potro wuxuu lahaa fursadda inuu kujiro kooxda labaad, laakiin tan laftirkeeda waxay ubaahatay in la helo firaaqo gaaban kadib markaad gaartid 6-6."" This implies the issue occurred *during* the first set, when the score reached 6-6 and a tiebreak was needed. Then it states ""Putro ayaa laga daaweey garabka hadda laakin wuxuu awooday inuu ciyaarta kusoo noqdo"", confirming he received treatment during the match.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ka hor inta aan la gaarin isreebreebka koowaad:** The passage doesn't suggest the problem occurred before the possibility of a tiebreak.
*   **C: Inta lagu guda jiray wareegii labaad:** The passage only discusses the first set.
*   **D: Kadib isreebreebka sadexaad:** Again, the passage focuses solely on the first set/tiebreak situation.

The text states ""Murray ayaa ku guul dareystay qaybta hore..."" which translates to ""Murray failed in the first part..."" or ""Murray lost in the first round"". The rest of the text details what happened *after* Murray's loss.

"Sida ku xusan tuduca, yaa, gaar ahaan, lagu cadeeyay inuu bukaan yahay?","The correct answer is **B: Carruurta**.

The passage specifically states: ""Gabanatooraha sidoo kale wuxuu yidhi, """"Maanta waxaan ogaanay in caruur da' dugsiyeed ah loo aqoonsaday inay taabasho la yeesheen bukaanka."""""". This directly identifies children as having contact with the patient.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gudoomiyaha:** The passage doesn't state the governor is sick.
*   **C: Saraakiisha Texas:** The passage says the governor promised action regarding public safety, but doesn't say they are sick.
*   **D: Muwaadiniinta deegaanka:** The passage states the governor is addressing citizens but doesn't say they are patients."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Maxaa dammaanad qaad ah oo uusan guddoomiyuhu sameynin markii uu la hadlayay muwaadiniinta Texas?","The correct answer is **D: Kiisku maaha mid khatar ah**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states Perry said, """"Kiiskani waa khatar."""" (This case is dangerous.) Therefore, he *did not* guarantee that the case was not dangerous.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nidaamku si fiican ayuu u shaqaynayaa** - He directly states, """"Waxaase hubaal ah in nidaamkeenu u shaqayno siday ahayd inuu u shaqeeyo."""" (It is certain our system is working as it should.)
*   **B: Waxyaabo la sameeyay si loo dhowro nabadgelyada bulshada** - He promises steps will be taken to ensure public safety: """"wuxuu u ballan qaaday muwadiniinta Texas in talaabooyin lagu qaadayo in lagu ilaaliyo nabadgeliyada dadwaynaha."""" (He promised citizens of Texas that steps would be taken to safeguard public safety.)
*   **C: Waxay u qalabaysan yihiin si ay u daboolaan caqabadda** - He says, """"waxa jira meelo yaryar oo caalamkan si fiican ugu habboon inay waajahaan caqabadaha kiiskani keenay."""" (There are small places in this world well suited to face the challenges this case presents.)"
Waa kee warka kaftanka iyo majajalada ah ee aay sameyeen labadii ardeey ee hore ee UW?,"Jawaabta saxda ah waa **A: Warbixinta Colbert**.

Qoraalka wuxuu sidoo kale tilmaamayaa in qoraayaasha The Onion ay saameyn ku yeesheen showyada Stewart iyo Colbert, taasoo xoojisa in Colbert Report ay tahay jawaabta ku habboon."

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Waa maxay waxa aay boolisku ilaalinaayeen?","The correct answer is **C: Qaybta kaso galitaanka wadada Downing**.

Here's why:

The text states the protest *started* ""opposite Whitehall, in the areas guarded by the soldiers of Downing Street."" This directly indicates the police were concerned with maintaining access to Downing Street. While the protest *moved* to Trafalgar Square and eventually Holborn, the initial police intervention was to manage the disruption to traffic near Downing Street, therefore guarding the access to it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Trafalgar Square:** The protest *passed through* Trafalgar Square, but it wasn't what the police were initially guarding.
*   **B: Madasha gu'ga:** This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Huteelka Grand Connaught Rooms:** This was the *destination* of the protest, not what the police were guarding at the start."

The text states: ""Markay ahayd 11:20, booliisku waxay ka codsadeen mudaaharaadayaasha inay dib ugu noqdaan waddada laamiga, iyaga oo sheegay inay u baahan yihiin isku dheelitiranka xaqa ay u leeyihin mudaaharadka iyo saxmadda taraafigga ee dhismaysa.""  This directly indicates the police requested the protesters to move at 11:20 to manage traffic."
Maxaa ka run ah cilmi-baarista uu sameeyay Dhakhtar Ehud Uur?,"The correct answer is **B: Qaar ka mid ah jiirarka hore u qaway sonkorowga ayaa hada aan qawin sonkorowga**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Waxaa hadda noo jooga jiirar 4 bilood jira oo aan qabin cudurka macaanka kuwaaso hore u qabi"" jiray. which translates to ""We currently have 4-month-old mice who do not have diabetes who previously had it.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text specifically mentions the results are *not* relevant to people with Type 1 diabetes.
*   **C:** Dr. Ur expresses caution and doubt about a *cure* for diabetes, making this overly optimistic.
*   **D:** The text states the opposite - mice *without* diabetes previously are now *without* diabetes.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, waa maxay Dr. Waxa aad ka shakisan tahay?","The correct answer is **B: Haddii la daaweyn karo oo suurtogal tahay**.

The passage states: ""shaki ayuu isna ka qabaa in cudurka macaanka la dawayn karo"" - which translates to ""he also doubts whether diabetes can be cured"".  This directly indicates Dr. Ur's skepticism about the possibility of a cure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage says he doubts the results *relate* to Type 1 diabetes, not whether they apply to people with it.
*   **C:** He's expressing *his own* doubt, not questioning the opinions of others.
*   **D:** This is not mentioned in the passage.

Sababta:

Qoraalka ayaa sheegaya in diyaaradu ay isku dayday ""wajihidiisa labaad"" oo ay joojisay, taasna macnaheedu waa in ay laba jeer isku dayday soo degista, inkastoo aan la sheegin in ay saddex jeer isku dayday. Bayaanada kale ee A, B, iyo D ayaa si sax ah ugu qeexaya xogta laga helay qoraalka."
Maxaa sababay in Duulimaadka CG4684 in aay joojiso so caga dhigashadeeda?,"The correct answer is **D: Xaaladaha cimilada waxay ahayd mid liidata**

The text states: ""Baadhista waxa caqab ku noqday isla cimiladii xumayd ee sababtay soo degistii la joojiyay."" (The search was hampered by the same bad weather that caused the aborted landing.)

This directly links the bad weather to the reason the landing was aborted.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Nasiib wanaag waxba iguma dhicin"" (Luckily, nothing happened to me). This directly indicates Franciszek Kowal was not harmed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waxa uu u suurtogashay in uu jabiyo daaqada** (He managed to break the window) - The text says the windows *couldn't* be broken, and it was broken *after* people started getting out.
* **C: Kursi uu jabiyey isagoo isku dayaya inuu ka baxsado** (He broke a chair while trying to escape) - The text mentions people were knocking chairs *into* the windows, not breaking them *with* chairs to escape.  It doesn't specify Franciszek Kowal broke a chair.
* **D: Waa uu dhaawacmay isaga oo isku dayaya in uu daaqad jabiyo** (He was injured while trying to break a window) - The text specifically says nothing happened to him.

Waa maxay sababta ay u adag tahay in la qiyaaso saamaynta suurtagalka ah ee Duufaanta kulaalaha Danielle?,"Jawaabta saxda ah waa **C: Duufaanta ayaa aad uga fog dhacdada duufaanta oo ku dul wareegaysa dhulka**.

Qoraalka ayaa sheegaya in duufaantu ay ka fogtahay bariga, taasoo adkeyneysa in la qiimeeyo wax yeelada ay u geysan karto Qaramada Midoobey iyo Caribbean-ka.  Sidaa darteed, fogeeda ayaa ah sababta ay adag tahay in la qiyaaso saamaynteeda.

Halkan waxaa ah sababaha kale ee jawaabaha kale aanay saxeyn:

*   **A:** Inkastoo duufaantu la saadaalinayo inay xoogaysan doonto, taasi maaha sababta ay adag tahay in la qiyaaso saamaynteeda hadda.
*   **B:** Qoraalku wuxuu sheegayaa xawaaraha dabaysha, oo ah qiimayn la sameeyay.
*   **D:** Fogeeda Miami maahan sababta ay adag tahay in la qiyaaso saamaynteeda Qaramada Midoobey iyo Caribbean-ka."

*   **B: Waxaa lagu sameeyay badweynta Atlantic Ocean:** Tuducyada ayaa sheegaya in duufaantu ka sameysantay bariga Bada Atlantic.
*   **C: Wuxay isu bedeli kartaa duufaanta hurricane-ka:** Saynisyahannada ayaa saadaalinaya in Danielle ay xoogaysan doonto illaa ay noqoto duufaan."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Maxaa lasoo jeediyay inay tahay inay ku dhacaan cudurka ka hor inta uusan keenin safmareen ama faafitaan caalami ah?","The correct answer is **A: Waa in ay noqotaa mid isdhiibay** (It needs to become milder).

Here's why:

The passage states Dr. Lee believes some research suggests diseases become ""less dangerous before they become global pandemics.""  ""Less dangerous"" means milder, or attenuated - essentially, that the virus ""gives up"" some of its potency.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Astaamuhu waa inay ahaadaan kuwo dhexdhexaad ah** (Symptoms should be moderate) - The passage doesn't say symptoms should be moderate, just that the disease should become less dangerous.
*   **C: Dad badan ayaa u baahan inay cudurka qaadaan** (Many people need to get sick) - This is the opposite of what the passage implies; the concern is spread *without* symptoms.
*   **D: Carruurtu waa inay dareemaan oo aay yeeshaan astaamaha** (Children need to feel and have symptoms) - The passage specifically says the concern is children contracting H5N1 *without* symptoms.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, masaafo Intee le'eg ayay Fujian ka fogayd duufaanka?","The correct answer is **C: 70 kiiloomitir**.

The text states: ""Habeenkii Agosto 9ka, isha Morakot ayaa **70 kilomiitar u jirtay gobolka Shiinaha ee Fujian.**"" (On the night of August 9th, the eye of Morakot was **70 kilometers away from China's Fujian province.**)

The question asks how far the storm was from Fujian, and the text directly provides that information as 70 kilometers."
Yaa salaamay George W. Bush markii uu yimid Aasiya?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng iyo Lee Hsien Loong**.

The passage states that Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng greeted Bush, and he later spoke with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.  Therefore, both of them greeted him.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ra'iisul Wasaaraha** - While he *met* with the Prime Minister, the initial greeting was by the Deputy Prime Minister.
*   **B: Dadka dhagaystayaasha ah** - Bush *spoke* to an audience, but they didn't greet him.
*   **D: Ra’iisul Wasaare ku xigeenka** -  Wong Kan Seng is the Deputy Prime Minister, but Lee Hsien Loong also greeted him. The most complete answer includes both.



"
Goorma ayuu madaxweynuhu ka hadlay dhinaca balaarinta ganacsiga Aasiya?,"The correct answer is **C: Kadib markii uu ku guuldareystay doorashadii dhexe ee dalka**

The text states: ""Kadib markii uu doorashada dhexe lumiyay muddo usbuuc ah, Bush wuxu dhagaytayaasha uga warramay ku fidinta ganacsiga ee Aasiya."" This directly links his speech on expanding trade with Asia to *after* he lost the midterm elections.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, kee baa soo socda oo ah hadafka guud ee ay dowladdu higsanayso?","The correct answer is **D: In la yareeyo buux-dhaafka aadka ah ee gaari faraska** (To reduce the excessive congestion of freight vehicles).

Here's why:

* The text states the efforts are to address ""goobaha buuqa ku badan yahay"" (areas with high congestion). 
* Adding more vehicles (300 additional to the existing 1000) is *a means to an end* – the end being to manage or reduce congestion.  The goal isn't simply to *have* more vehicles, but to address a problem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The efforts *started* in March, but the goal isn't just to fund vehicles *by* March.
* **B & C:** While the text mentions quantities (300 and 1,300 vehicles), those are just the *numbers* of vehicles being added, not the overarching goal.



"
Maxay dowladdu ku dhawaaqday?,"The correct answer is **A: Waxay qorsheynayaan inay maalgeliyaan 300 oo gaari faras oo dheeraad ah**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...dheerad ah 300 buundoyin/bariijyo guud ahaan 1,300 gawaadhida qaada xamuulka..."" which translates to ""...an additional 300 units/barriers in addition to 1,300 cargo vehicles...""
* This directly indicates the government is investing in 300 additional vehicles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the initiative *aims* to address congestion, the announcement isn't *about* being committed to solving the problem, it's about *how* they're addressing it.
* **C:** The passage says 300 *additional* vehicles bring the total to 1,300, not that they're investing in 1,300 new ones.
* **D:** The initiative began in March, but the announcement isn’t about solving congestion *by* March. It’s an update *on* efforts begun in March.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaa xog ah oo la og yahay?","The correct answer is **A: Heerka hanjabaadu ayaa la yareeyay** (The threat level has been lowered).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Wax warbixin ah oo sheegaysa in weerar la filayay ma jirto."" (There was no information indicating an expected attack.) and ""Hase ahaatee, yaraanshaha heerka khatareed lama macno aha in khatartii meesha ka baxday."" (However, the lowering of the threat level did not mean the threat was gone).  

This shows the threat *level* was lowered, but doesn't mean there's *no* threat, or that a specific attack is expected.  Option D is incorrect because the text doesn't mention intelligence confirming a severe attack. Option B is incorrect because the text explicitly says the threat hasn't disappeared. Option C is incorrect because there's no information indicating an attack *is* expected.



"
Bayaankee la xidhiidhamudaaharaadyada k oo aan ahayn mid run ah?,"The correct answer is **A: Komishanka ama Guddiga Madaxtooyadda oo jawaab ka bixiyay mudaharaadyada.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states the CEP was a *response* to the protests**, initiated *by* President Martelly. It doesn't say the Presidential Commission *responded to* the protests with a plan. It was the protests that prompted the commission to suggest a voter list update and the new CEP.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

* **B: Doorashooyinka oo waqtigoodii kadib dhacay ayaa keenay mudaharaadyada:** The passage explicitly states the protests stemmed from the failure to hold elections since 2011.
* **C: Mudaaharaadyadu ama Dibadbaxayaashu waxay dalbadeen is-casilaadda CEP-da hore:** While not directly stated, it's strongly implied the protests were about the lack of elections and the failings of the previous CEP.
* **D: Mudaaharaadyadu mararka qaar waxay ahaayeen kuwo rabshado wata:** The passage confirms ""sometimes the protests were violent.""



"
Yaa soo jeediyay in CEP kii ugu dambeeyay in uu is casilo?,"The correct answer is **C: Komishanka ama Guddiga Madaxtooyadda**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bishii u danbaysay guddida madaxweynenimo ayaa soo jeedisay sugidda diwaangalin si ay qayb uga noqoto bakageka lagu cabirayo in wadanku lagu jiheeyo qbsoomidda doorashooyin cusub.""  This means the Presidential Commission (Guddiga Madaxtooyadda) suggested a postponement of registration, which is directly related to the situation with the CEP. This suggests they were the ones pushing for changes that led to the new CEP being formed. 

The text doesn't say Martelly proposed the last CEP resign, nor do the protesters, or the CEP members themselves.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad bayaanka, waa maxay waxa aaysan taageerin guddiga qaran ee maamulka ciyaaraha ee Maraykanka ka dib xadgudubka Nassar ee ciyaartoyda?","The correct answer is **A: Xil ka qaadis (Impeachment)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the USOC believes it's better to continue ""meaningful change within the organization"" *rather than* pursuing impeachment (""shahaadada lagala noqon lahaa"").  This directly indicates they do *not* support impeachment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hagaajinta ama abuuritaanka deegaan awood leh (Improving or creating an empowering environment)** - The passage *supports* this. They want a safe and empowering environment for athletes.
*   **C: Isbeddellada lagama maarmaanka ah ee ururka dhexdiisa (Necessary changes within the organization)** - The passage *supports* this, stating they believe in continuing meaningful change.
*   **D: Baaritaan madax banaan (Independent investigation)** - The passage states USA Gymnastics *supports* an independent investigation.

Therefore, the only option the passage demonstrates the USOC is *not* supporting is impeachment.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad bayaanka, Muxuu yahay hadafka ugu weyn ee golaha maamulka qaranka ciyaaraha dalka Maraykanka iyo guddiga Olombikada Maraykanka ee horay u socday?","The correct answer is **D: Horumarinta jawi amaan ah oo loogu talagalay ciyaaraha fudud**.

Here's why:

The passage states that both USA Gymnastics and the USOC share a goal of ""making the sport of gymnastics, and others, as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a positive, supportive, and empowering environment."" This directly points to creating a safer atmosphere as their primary aim.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Banaanka keenay xogta ku saabsan xadgudubka Larry Nassar:** While the Nassar abuse is *part* of the context, the statement focuses on the future – preventing further abuse and building safety.
*   **B: Raad raacitaanka ama dabagalka Xil ka qaadista:** The passage mentions supporting an independent investigation, but doesn’t primarily focus on accountability.
*   **C: Raad raacitaanka ama dabagalka baaritaanka qarsoodiga ah:**  Similar to B, investigation is a tool to achieve safety, not the ultimate goal.

Halkee ayuu markabka ku sii jeeday markii ay dhacdadu aay dhacday? ,"The correct answer is **D: Japan**.

Here's why:

The text states the ship was ""heading to Sasebo, Nagasaki, Japan"" when the incident occurred. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maraykanka (USA):** The ship was *from* the US, but not heading *to* the US.
*   **B: Puerto Rico:** The text mentions Puerto Princesa, but the ship was not heading *to* Puerto Rico.
*   **C: Palawan:** The ship was traveling *from* Palawan, not *to* Palawan.



"
Keebaan ahayn xaqiiqda dhabta ah ee ku saabsan markabka ku xusan tuduca?,"The correct answer is **D: Waxa loo qoondeeyay guutada Toddobaad ee Ciidanka Badda ee Maraykanka**.

Here's why:

The passage states the ship was headed to Sasebo, Nagasaki, Japan, and was part of the U.S. Navy's **Seventh Fleet**, not a ""guutada Toddobaad"" (which translates to ""Seventh Brigade"" - a different type of military unit).

Let's look at why the other options *are* true:

*   **A: Waxay ku sii socotay puerto Princesa** - The text explicitly states it was traveling to Puerto Princesa.
*   **B: Waxay ku salaysan tahay Palawan** - The text confirms it was near Palawan.
*   **C: Waxaa weeye nooc ka mid ah markabkii badda ee loo yaqaano mine countermeasures** - The text says it's a mine countermeasures vessel.



"
Yaa soo saaray bayaanka la xiriira ciidamada Mareykanka?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

The text states: ""Axadii ugu danbeyse, Madaxweynahay Mareykanka Donald Trump, xog bixin uu soo mariye xafiiska saxaafada, ku dhawaaqay in ciidamada Mareykanka ay ka bixi doonan Syria."" This clearly indicates that Donald Trump issued the statement."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad bayaanka, wadankee qaaday mas'uuliyadda ilaalinta dagaalyahannada maxaabiista ah?","The correct answer is **D: Turkiga**.

The text explicitly states: ""Turkiga ayaa sidoo kale la wareegi doonaa ilaalinta dagal yahanada ISIS oo la qabtay..."" (Turkey will also take responsibility for guarding the captured ISIS fighters...).
"
Maxaa la aaminsan yahay inuu yahay sababta keentay inuu burburka dhaco?,"The correct answer is **C: Dhulka buuraleyda ah**.

The passage states: ""Burburku wuxuu ka dhacay figta sare ee dhulka buuralayda ah, waxaana la rumaysanyahay inuu sababay dab daran."" This translates to ""The collapse occurred on the upper slopes of the mountainous terrain, and it is believed to have been caused by a severe fire.""  Therefore, the mountainous terrain is linked to the collapse. While a fire *resulted* from the collapse, the terrain is what's believed to be the primary cause.



"
Dhul noocee ah ayuu shilku ka dhacay?,"The correct answer is **D: Dhulka Buuraleyda ah** (Mountainous terrain).

The passage explicitly states: ""...burburku wuxuu ka dhacay figta sare ee dhulka buuralayda ah..."" which translates to ""...the collapse occurred on the upper slopes of the mountainous terrain...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cadawga ah** (Enemy) - The passage doesn't mention an enemy presence or involvement.
*   **B: Cadawga ah** (Enemy) - Same as above.
*   **C: Isku dhaca** (Collision) - While a collapse *could* be caused by a collision, the text only describes the *where* and *what* of the collapse, not the cause. It suggests a fire may be the cause.



"
Maxay mas’uuliyiintu ka rajeynayaan natiijada fatahaadda?,"The correct answer is **C: Tirada Kalluunka sida federaalka ah loo ilaaliyo ee humpback chubs oo tiradiisu badatay**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""masuuliyiinta waxa ay raajeynayaan in ay ku filnaan doonan dib usoo celinta nabaad guurki carada"" which translates to ""officials are hoping it will be enough to restore the health of the fish population"".  The example fish mentioned is the humpback chub, which is already in a precarious state. Therefore, the officials' hope is centered around the recovery of these at-risk fish, specifically the humpback chub.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dib uso celinta bacaadka bada** - The text doesn't mention a ""bacaadka bada"" (sea bed). It discusses river ecosystems.
*   **B: Abuuritaanka ama samaaynta xeebaha** - While the dam was important for stabilizing banks, the focus of the hope after the flood is fish recovery, not shoreline creation.
*   **D: Kaymaha hooyga u ah duurjoogta oo badan** -  While habitat is important, the specific focus of the official's hope is the fish populations.



"
Kuwaan soo socda keebaa dhismihii biyo xireenka si joogto ah u saameeyey?,"The correct answer is **B: Kalluunka sida federaalka ah loo ilaaliyo ee humpback chubs**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that two fish species were *extirpated* (dabar go'ay) and two are *endangered* (halis ah), specifically mentioning the humpback chub as one of them. This demonstrates a direct and negative impact of the dam on these fish populations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bacaadka xeebta:** While the text mentions the importance of stabilizing banks, it doesn’t say the dam *caused* erosion. It says erosion *was* a problem that the dam helped with.
*   **C: Kaymaha hooyga u ah duurjoogta:** The text mentions the importance of habitat for wildlife but doesn’t indicate the dam directly harmed this habitat, only that bank stabilization was important for it.
*   **D: Faafitaanka maatarka biyaha salkooda fadhiya:** The text discusses water level changes but doesn't connect it to an impact on the ecosystem floor.

The passage focuses on the negative impact on fish, making humpback chubs the correct answer."

The passage specifically states the US received information from ""sources that it did not identify publicly"". This is the same as ""isha wararka ee aan la shacin"" in Somali.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Xagjiriinta Soomaaliyeed** - The passage says the extremists *are planning* attacks, not that they *provided* the intelligence.
*   **B: Safaaradda dalka Itoobiya** - The passage does not mention the Ethiopian embassy providing any information.
*   **D: Isha wararka ee wadanka Kenya** - While the warning concerns Kenya, the passage doesn’t say Kenyan sources provided the information.

* The passage states the threat is from ""Xaqjiro ka soo jeeda Somaliya"" planning ""ismidamin isqarxis ah"" (suicide bombings) in **both** Kenya **and** Ethiopia (""Kenya iyo Ethopia labadaba"").
* It specifies these bombings would target ""meelaha caan ka ah"" (popular places).

*   Makis Triantafylopoulos is described as a ""reporter"" whose program is broadcast on TV. He is a journalist, not a lawyer."
Kooxda dadka ka midka ah aan lagu xusin inay qayb ka yihiin fadeexadda ka dhex jirta bulshada sharciga ah ee Giriigga?,"The correct answer is **C: Saxafiyiinta (Journalists)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions Makis Triantafyllopoulos, a journalist, as the person whose reporting *triggered* the unfolding scandal. He wasn't *involved* in the wrongdoing, but his work exposed it. The other options are all directly implicated:

*   **A: Abuukaateyaasha (Lawyers):** Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos, lawyers, are arrested.
*   **B: Garsoorayaasha (Judges):** Evangelos Kalousis, a supreme court judge, is arrested, and the text speaks of actions of judges in general.
*   **D: Qareennada (Solicitors/Barristers):**  Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos are specifically identified as solicitors.

Therefore, journalists are the only group mentioned as *not* being directly part of the corrupt actions."
Imisa gool ayaa laga badiyay Hindiya?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The passage states: ""markay lumisay fursadii kabtanimada Wikedka Hindiya waxay samaysay 36 wareeg oo qura iyadoo ku guuldaraysatay **7 wiked** si loo afjaro wareegyada.""  This means 7 wickets (goals) were lost by India.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxay ahayd dhibcihii ugu badnaa ee ciyaarta?","The correct answer is **C: 100 orod**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid played well and scored century (100-run) innings.""  This means a score of 100 was achieved by two players, making it the highest score mentioned in the text. 

While Robin Uthappa scored 70, it wasn't the *highest* score overall. 36 and 41 are lower scores as well."
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan sabab u ahayn niyad-jabka Adam Cuerden?,"The correct answer is **C: Oo aan laga dhagaaysanin dalka Wales**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Adam Cuerden felt betrayed because ""he [Wales] represented that he was listening to us, then quickly had his design removed."" This clearly indicates a feeling of not being heard or taken seriously, which is the core of the frustration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sharciyada cusub ee barta ee ku saabsan macluumaadka galmada:** While the passage mentions a wider issue of ""policy regarding sexual content,"" it doesn't directly state this *caused* Cuerden's distress. It's the consequence of the situation, not the cause of his feeling of being let down.
*   **B: Tirtiridda farshaxanka dalka Wales:** The removal of the artwork is part of the problem, but the core issue for Cuerden is the dishonesty and lack of communication *leading up* to it.
*   **D: Beenta ku saabsan sababta keentay tirtirka farshaxanka:**  While there was a lie about the reasons, the deeper issue is that he wasn't listened to at all.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, waa maxay waxa laga tirtiray barta?","The correct answer is **B: Macluumaadka ku saabsan galmada**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...dadaalada hadda ee siyaasada qabyada ah ee khuseeya waxyaalaha ku saabsan galmada... ayaa hawada galiyaan malaayiin kamida shabakadaha liisamada haystaa."" This implies that content *related to sex* was being broadcast, and is now the subject of the political efforts. The passage also says that his design was ""dhakhso ayaa loo tirtiray,"" meaning something was removed, and it's linked to these ""waxyaalaha ku saabsan galmada.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Farshaxanka** - There's no mention of art in the passage.
*   **C: Shuruucda qabyada ah** - The passage discusses *efforts* regarding censorship laws, not the laws themselves being removed.
*   **D: Warbaahinta sida gaarka ah loo leeyahay** - While the content is being distributed through licensed networks, the passage isn't about removing the networks themselves.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Kuwa soo socda keebaa Amir Khan uusan taageersanayn?","The correct answer is **A: Oo ay kamid yihiin dagaalyahannada haweenka ee Olombikada**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states Amir Khan said, ""Ilaa iyo meel hoose ayaa ka dareemayaa inaanay ahayn in dumarku dagaalamaan."" (Until a lower level, I feel that women should not fight). This clearly indicates he doesn't support women participating in combat sports like boxing in the Olympics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tartamayaasha Ingiriiska:** He states he *will* support the British Olympic athletes.
*   **C: Fikradaha dumarka:** While he disagrees with women fighting, the text doesn't say he doesn't respect women's opinions in general.
*   **D: London oo lagu qabanayo oo martigelinaysa ciyaaraha olompikada:** He supports the 2012 London Olympics.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Keeba kuwan soo socdaa ayuu Amir Khan taageeri doona inkastoo uu shaqsiyan fikradiisa shaqsi ahaaneed uu qabo?","The correct answer is **C: Ciyaaraha Olompikada 2012**.

The passage states that despite his personal belief that women shouldn't fight, Amir Khan ""will support the London 2012 Olympic Games competitors."" This directly indicates his support for the 2012 Olympics, even while holding his personal opinion.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagaalyahannada dumarka ah:** He explicitly states he doesn't think women *should* fight, so he wouldn't support female fighters.
*   **B: Tartamayaashiisi la tartamaaye Ciyaarihi Olompikada 2004:** The passage refers to his win in 2004 but doesn't say he'll support his former competitors.
*   **D: Biladaha qalinka ee kale:** The passage only mentions his *win* of the Quill award in 2004, not continued support for other awards.



"
Goorma ayuu dhintay Peter Lenz?,"The correct answer is **C: Isbitaalka**.

The text states: ""Waxa isla markiiba soo gaadhay shaqaalaha caafimaadka ee heeganka oo u qaaday cusbitaal maxalli ah halkaas oo uu markii danbe ku dhintay."" This directly translates to ""Medical personnel immediately arrived and took him to a local hospital where he later died."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Inta lagu guda jiray iskululaaynta diyaar garoowga** - While the accident happened *during* a warm-up lap, he didn't die then.
*   **B: Ka dib markii uu ka dhacay baaskiilkiisi** - He was still alive immediately after the fall, being attended to by medical personnel.
*   **D: Iyadoo ay la socdaan shaqaalaha caafimaadka** - He died *at* the hospital, not *with* the medical personnel."
Waa kuma Xavier Zayat?,"The correct answer is **B: Tartame kale**.

The passage states ""Lenz waxa ka dhacday baaskiilkiisa waxaana markaa kadib ka badiyay saaxiibkiis kale ee Xavier Zayat,"" which means Zayat was another racer who passed Lenz after he fell."
Xaalad nooce ah ayaa ayaa rakaabka diyaarda ee cabsida ama walaaca dareemaayo ay u badantahay in uu kaga faa'iideysto fahamka uu fahmaayo shaqada gudaha ee diyaaradda?,"The correct answer is **B: Haddii nacaybka ay ka qabaan duulista ay salka ku hayso cabsi aan la aqoonin.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that *understanding how planes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear and lack of control.* This implies the fear is lessened by *knowledge* dispelling an *unknown* fear. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** Feeling ashamed of fear doesn't relate to understanding plane mechanics.
*   **C:** A general opposition to all transportation isn't addressed by understanding how planes function.
*   **D:** Fear stemming from unrelated traumatic events wouldn't be alleviated by knowing about planes.

"Iyada oo ku saleysan tuduca, Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo laga rabaa inuu sameeyo shaqsiga socotada ah ee beeca warwarka kaqawa marka ugu danbeeeyso?","The correct answer is **D: Waxaad fiirisaa bogga Shirkada duulimaadyada (You look at the airline's website)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...waxaana muhiim ah inaad eegtid bogga internetka ee diyaaradda nafteeda intaadan qabsanin kursi"" ( ""...and it's important to look at the airline's own website before booking a seat""). This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ka raadi waxyaabaha ay bixiyaan shirkadaha socdaalka tirada badan (Look for what many travel companies offer):** The passage focuses on checking the *airline's* website, not multiple travel agencies.
*   **B: Si toos ah iskaga diiwaan gali Shirkada duulimaadyada (Register directly with the airline):** The passage doesn't mention registering; it's about *comparing prices* before booking.
*   **C: Is barbardhig qiimayaasha u dhexeeya shirkadaha socdaalka ee kala duwan (Compare prices between different travel companies):** While comparison is mentioned, the passage emphasizes checking the *airline's* website *in addition* to search results.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxay tahay in dadka safarka ah ay sameeyaan marka kowaad si ay u xaqiijiyaan qiimaha ugu fiican ee suurtagalka ah ee duulimaadka?","The correct answer is **B: Is barbardhig qiimayaasha u dhexeeya hay'adaha dalbashada dulimaatka ee kala duwan**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...muhiim ah inaad isubarbar dhigto natiijooyinka baaritaankaada..."" (it is important that you compare your search results). It also mentions checking the airline's website *in addition* to searching, implying the initial step is comparison.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waxaad fiirisaa bogga Shirkada duulimaadyada** - The passage says to *also* check the airline's website, but not as the first step.
*   **C: Si toos ah iskaga diiwaan gali adiga oo u maraayo Shirkada duulimaadyada** - The passage doesn't suggest booking immediately.
*   **D: Si toos ah iskaga diiwaan gali wakaalada safarka** - Similar to C, the passage focuses on *comparing* before booking, not immediate registration with an agency.



"
Goorma ayaa wehel looga baahan yahay inuu raaco alaabta dhiibaalka ah?,"The correct answer is **A: Marka alaabta lagu soo diro iyada oo la saaraayo xamuulka hawada.**

The passage states: ""Shirkadaha duulimad ma ogola alaab aan cidna la socon, sababta aad adiga u joogta taasa."" This directly implies that someone (a companion) is needed when shipping goods via air freight because the airlines require it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Marka ay shirkadda isticmaalayso diyaaradaha ayada u gaarka ah:** The passage doesn't mention private planes or if companion requirements change with them.
* **C: Marka alaabta laso diro ayaga oo ah boorsooyin la hubiyay:**  While inspection is mentioned, it's not the reason a companion is required.
* **D: Marka alaabta la diraayo ay gacanta ku hayaan shirkad weyn:** The passage says larger companies *might* have central hubs, but this doesn’t relate to needing a companion.

"Iyada oo ku saleysan tuduca, marka aad dooranayso diyaarad duulimaadkooda joogtada ah ee shuraakada ah, kuwan soo socda keebaa aay tahay inaad mudnaan siiso?","The correct answer is **D: Shirkada duulimaadyada laga yaabo in aad ka heshid mudnooyinka gaarka ah oo dheeraad ah**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that benefits *vary* depending on the destination and airline. It suggests looking beyond loyalty to the airline you fly most often and considering which airline offers the *best benefits* for your specific travel needs. Option D directly reflects this advice.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Shirkada duulimaadyada ee bixisa dhibcaha ugu badan** - While earning points is good, the passage implies benefits are more complex than just points.
*   **B: Shirkadaha duulimaadyada ee shuraakada ugu weyn** - Size doesn't guarantee better benefits.
*   **C: Shirkada duulimaadyada aad had iyo jeer aad ku safartid** - The passage actively cautions against *automatically* choosing the airline you are most used to.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Yaa laga yaabaa inuu bixiyo dhibcaha duulimaadka ah ee ugu badan?","The correct answer is **D: Shirkadaha duulimaadyada ka duwan oo ku dhex jira shurakada isku midka ah**.

Here's why:

The passage states that rewards can vary based on destination and that *other* airlines within the same alliance might offer more rewards. This means it's not necessarily the airline you fly the most (options B and C) but rather different airlines *within* the same alliance (option D) that could offer the most points. 

Option A is too broad – it doesn’t specify any connection to reward programs.

Here's why:

The passage states that long-term problems from excessive alcohol use can include **blindness** (indhoolnimo). It also mentions methanol in illegally produced alcohol can cause **loss of vision** (indho la'aan).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maqalka (Hearing):** The passage does not mention any impact on hearing.
*   **C: Dhadhanka (Taste):** The passage does not mention any impact on taste.
*   **D: Urinta (Smell):** The passage does not mention any impact on smell."
"Sida lagu xusay tuduca, maxaa suurtagal ah in ay yareeyaan dhibaatooyinka waxyeelada leh ee khamriga?","The correct answer is **C: U Isticmaalka khamriga si dhexdhexaad ah**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states ""Cabitaanka alkakoolada waxay u sameysa qof walba siyabo kala duwan, iyo adiguna in aad ogato xad kaaga waa muhiim."" This directly supports the idea that moderation is key to reducing harm.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isticmaalka khamriga uu kujiro maadada mitanoolka** - The passage warns that methanol is a *dangerous* substance found in illicit alcohol, and can cause blindness or death.
*   **B: Cabitaanka nooca khamriga spirits-ka ee sida sharci darrada ah loosoo saaray** - The passage explicitly states this *increases* risk due to dangerous contaminants.
*   **D: Cabidda khamriga oo lala cabbo dad badan** - The passage doesn't mention anything about whether drinking with others increases or decreases harm."
Aaway qiimaha hantida ee ka mid ah kuwa ugu sarreeya Amsterdam?,"The correct answer is **A: Degmada Kanaalka** (The Canal District).

Here's why:

* The text specifically states: ""qiimaha dhismayaasheeduna waa kuwa ugu qaalisan waddanka."" and this refers to the buildings *within* the Canal District.
* The other options are too broad. While UNESCO status and historical value are important, the text pinpointed the Canal District as having the highest property values.

The text specifically states the area was recognized by UNESCO for its ""qiimaheeda dhaqan iyo taariikheed ee gaarka ah"" (its special cultural and historical value).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Waxaay leedahay hanti gaar ah (It has unique assets)** - While true, the text *specifies* that the assets are cultural and historical.
*   **C: Sababtoo ah goobteeda waxaa ku hareeraysan Binnenstad (Because its location is surrounded by Binnenstad)** - Its location is mentioned, but it's not the *reason* for UNESCO recognition.
*   **D: sababtoo ah Waxay leedahay qiimaha sare ee hantida (Because it has high asset value)** -  The text mentions the buildings are among the most valuable in the country, but the UNESCO recognition is based on cultural and historical significance, not just monetary value.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, kuwan soo socda kee baa ka dhigaya booqashada Phnom Krom mid qiimo leh?","The correct answer is **A: Muuqa sare ee Tonle Sap**.

The text states: ""Baqdinta jawiga degan macbuudka iyo eegida xaga saree buurta ee biyaha Tonle Sap waxay ka dhigeysa fuluteen keeda mid qiimo leh."" This directly translates to ""The serenity of the temple atmosphere and the high view of Tonle Sap from the mountain make its execution worthwhile.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ku safritaanka goobaha qadiimiga ah ee Angkor:** The text mentions the Angkor Pass is needed, but doesn't say visiting ancient sites *makes* Phnom Krom worthwhile.
*   **C: Arkaya Siem Reap:** Siem Reap is just the location of Phnom Krom, not a reason the temple itself is valuable to visit.
*   **D: Safarka doonta ee kusii socdo harada:** While a boat trip can *accompany* the visit, the text doesn't state it's what makes the visit worthwhile, but rather an extra activity.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Maxaa looga baahan yahay booqdayaasha si aay uso galaan Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **C: Booqanaya Angkor Pass**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Angkor Pass ayaa laga rabaa si aad u gasho macbadka..."" which translates to ""An Angkor Pass is required to enter the temple..."".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Koritaanka macbadka hore ee Yasovarman** - This refers to *when* the temple was built, not what you need to enter.
*   **B: Socdaalka Hareeraha Siem Reap** - The passage mentions Phnom Krom is near Siem Reap, but doesn't say travel *around* Siem Reap is required.
*   **D: Doon ka raacaya agagaarka Tonle Sap** - While a boat trip is *suggested* as a way to enhance your visit, it's not a requirement for entry."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, kuwan soo socda kee baa ka hortagi kara dalxiise inuu soo booqdo Antarctica?","The correct answer is **A: Miisaaniyad safarka oo ballaaran**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Boqashada dalxiisku waa qarash"" (Tourism is expensive). This directly implies that the cost of travel is a barrier to visiting Antarctica.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Danta keliya ee laga leeyahay u sahaminta Badda Ross:** The text mentions the Ross Sea as a location, but doesn't suggest interest in it would *prevent* a visit.
*   **C: Jadwal shaqo oo kuu ogolaanaya safarada bilaha Diisambar iyo Janaayo:** The text specifies the best time to visit is November-February, so a schedule allowing travel during those months would *enable* a visit.
*   **D: Dhaqdhaqaaq jireed oo xadidan:** The text mentions needing to be physically fit (""jir ahan inad dhisnaato""), but this is a requirement *for* tourism, not something that prevents it."
Dalxiise xiiseeynaayaa fuulista buuraha ayaa laga yaabaa inuu booqdo qaybtee ka mid ah Antartikda oo uu boqoni donaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Badda Ross**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Takhasuslyaal ku dalxiisa dhanka hawada ayaa marmar u aada dhanka oogada buuro koris..."" (Specialists interested in mountaineering sometimes go towards the mountain ranges...) and ""hal meel ayad ku qaadan kartaa xaagaga bisha Novermber ilaa February waa meesha ugu weyn Peninsula, Jasirada iyo **Bada Ross**."" (One place you can visit in the summer from November to February is the largest of the Peninsula, Islands, and **Ross Sea**.)

Therefore, the Ross Sea is the region mentioned as being relevant to mountaineering and accessible to tourists."
Aaway waxyaabihi waxa lagu eegi jiray ee hore ee casriga aha halkee ugu dhawdahay in laga helo?,"The correct answer is **B: Bartamaha magaalada** (Center of the city).

Here's why:

The passage states that older observatories ""were often located in towns or camps, which were easier to reach."" This directly implies they were in accessible, urban areas - the center of the city. The passage contrasts this with *modern* observatories which are in remote locations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Meel si fudud loo heli karo** (An easily accessible place) - While true, it's too general. ""Center of the city"" is a *specific* type of easily accessible place mentioned in the text.
* **C: Melaha aadka u fog** (Very remote places) - The passage explicitly states older observatories weren't in remote places; that's a characteristic of *modern* ones.
* **D: Kambaska kulliyadda** (University campus) - While some observatories *are* on campuses, the passage doesn't specifically mention this as a common location for the older observatories. The focus is on towns and camps.



"
Halkeey u dhawdahay in xoqadka\\telescope-ka casriga ah in lagu keeydiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Xarunta aadka u weyn** (A very large facility).

Here's why:

The passage states modern telescopes are ""dhismooyiin weyn oo ku yaalo meelo fog oo leh jawi fiican"" - *large buildings in remote locations with good atmosphere*. This directly translates to a large facility.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Matxafka dhexdiisa** (Inside the museum) - The passage says old observatories *became* museums, not that modern ones are *in* museums.
*   **B: Kambaska jaamacada** (University campus) - While some telescopes are affiliated with universities, the passage emphasizes the *remoteness* of modern telescopes, which isn't typical of a campus.
*   **C: Goobta waxbarashada** (Educational site) - Similar to B, this is too general and doesn't capture the specific need for remote, atmospheric conditions.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Halkee baa ugu fiican in lagu nagaado malinta xeebta ee jawigu xasiloonyahay?","The correct answer is **C: Degmada North Harbor**.

Here's why:

*   The text states the beaches in North Harbour are ""almost all sandy and suitable for swimming"" and ""many have shelters provided by pohutukawa trees."" This suggests they are well-equipped and pleasant for a day at the beach, especially on a calm day.
*   While Mission Bay and St Heliers are mentioned, the text describes them as potentially ""busy"" and ""crowded"" – not ideal for a relaxing day.
*   Waitemata Harbor is a location, not a specific beach area.

Therefore, North Harbour is presented as the most suitable option for a peaceful beach day."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, xagee xaaladaha dabaasha ay u badan tahay inay ugu badbaado ama amaan badan tahay?","The correct answer is **B: Degmada North Harbor**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Xeebaha Waqooyi (ee ku yaal degmada North Harbour) waxay ku yaaliin Badwaynta Baasifiga waxaanay fidsan yihiin laga soo Long Bay da ku taal waqooyiga ilaa Devonport ta Koonfureed. Ku dhowaad dhamaantod waa xeebo bacaad kuna haboon dabaalasho amaana...""

This clearly indicates that the beaches in the North Harbour region are generally safe for swimming. While Devonport and Long Bay are *within* that region, the text broadly describes the safety of the entire North Harbour area.

Here's why:

The prompt explicitly states:

*   ""Ha ku kaftami Halokooska iyo Naasiyiinta."" (Do not joke about the Holocaust and Nazis.)
*   ""Waxba haka badelin goobta calamadeen ama xoqid ku sawirid qaab wax."" (Do not alter the site, deface it, or draw on it.)

Therefore, making jokes (shactiro/majaajilo) or altering the site's structure (xoqid qaab dhismeedka) are both disrespectful and unacceptable behaviors in this context.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku-dhaqanka sharafta leh** (Acting respectfully) - This is the *desired* behavior.
*   **B: Kaga tagaayo astaan mel ah agagaarka barta** (Leaving a mark around the area) - While potentially not ideal, it's not explicitly prohibited in the text and is less offensive than joking or vandalism."
Keeba ka mid ah kuwan oo qeexaya luqadaha lingua francas?,"Jawabka saxda ah waa **D: Oorgaanika ah**.

Sababta:

Qormisku wuxuu sheegay in Lingua Francas ay tahay luqad *dabiici ama asal ah*. ""Oorgaanika ah"" waa ereyga ugu dhow ee macno ahaan ka tarjumaya dabiiciga ah.

Halkan fiiri sababaha waxyaabaha kale aanay ku habboonayn:

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that *Lingua Francas* are natural languages that become common tools of communication between speakers of different languages. Option A describes this. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** While both natural and constructed languages exist, the passage focuses on Lingua Francas being *natural* languages.
*   **C:** This describes *constructed languages* (like Esperanto), not Lingua Francas.
*   **D:** This also describes *constructed languages*, not Lingua Francas.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxay tahay in qofka rakaabka ahi uu hubiyo in dalxiiskoodu yahay mid ku beegan xilliga qaboobaha?","The correct answer is **B: Shuruudaha fiisaha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Rakaabka markabka dalxiiska lagama rabo fiise (eeg shuruudaha)."" This directly means passengers need to check the visa requirements. The passage also states the time of year can cause issues (""baraf dhex maristo keento sanqadh xun...""). Therefore, checking the visa requirements will likely reveal any seasonal restrictions or requirements related to the cold weather.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Goobta guriga geedaha ah ee qaaska ah** - This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Shuruudooyinka** - While related to visas, ""shuruudaha fiisaha"" is more specific and directly referenced in the text.
*   **D: Inta ay le'egtahay waqtigii aad lagu qaatay magaalada** - The time spent in the city is mentioned, but not as something to *check* to ensure the trip is in a suitable season."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, haddii safarka rakaabku uu yahay mid ku beegan xiliga xagaaga, maxaa laga yaabaa inay ka fogaadaan?","The correct answer is **B: Dhexmaritaanka barafka**.

Here's why:

The passage states that travelling through ice can cause severe discomfort and affect the most impacted areas. It specifically mentions this in the context of passing the Baltic Sea and warns about ice during winter. While the passage doesn't say they *will* avoid it in summer, it implies that ice is a problem to avoid when travelling in that region. The context suggests summer travel avoids the issue of ice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waqtiga aay ku qaataan magaalada** - The passage says there's a limited time in town, but it doesn't suggest tourists try to avoid that.
*   **C: Shuruudaha fiisaha** - The passage mentions visa requirements but doesn't suggest avoiding them, just being aware of them.
*   **D: Saint Petersburg** - There's no indication tourists would want to avoid the city itself."
Waa maxay sababta Catalan-ka inta badan loogu isticmaalo calaamadaha iyo ogeysiisyada Barcelona?,"The correct answer is **B: Waxay ahayd luuqaddii ugu horeysay ee rasmi ah ee magaaladda**

Here's why:

The text states: ""...calamadaha ugu badan waxay qeexaan keliya luqada katalanka loo yaqaano maxaa yeeley waxaa loo aas aasay si sharciyan luqadada rasmiga ah.""  This directly translates to ""most signs define only the Catalan language because it was founded to legally establish the official language.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Si aad u ballaaran ayaa loo fahamsanyahay marka lala barbar dhigo Isbaanishka** - The text says *everyone* understands Spanish, and almost prefer Catalan, so it's not a matter of Spanish being less understood.
*   **C: Waa luuqadda aadka looga door bido ku hadalkeeda magaalada Barcelona** - While it says people *prefer* Catalan, the reason for its prominence on signs is a legal/historical one, not just preference.
*   **D: Wargeyska Metro iyo tas-hiilaadka kale ee dadweynaha waxaa inta badan taga muwaadiniinta ku hadla Catalan-ka** - The text doesn't mention anything about who uses the Metro or public facilities."
"Luuqadaha soo socda keebaa laga isticmaalaa nidaamka Wargeyska Metro ee magaalada Barcelona, si loogu dhawaaqo ogeysiisyada joogtada ah?","The correct answer is **B: Catalan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Iclaanada joogtada ah ee Metro ayaa laga sameeyaa kaliya Catalan"". This directly translates to ""Regular announcements in the Metro are made only in Catalan"".

While the automated system *does* announce disruptions in multiple languages, the *regular* announcements are only in Catalan.

"Iyada oo ku saleysan tuduca, Midkee ka mid ah waxyaalahan soo socda ee aan loo badnayn in la kala horraysiiyo sariir heersare ah iyo quraac?","The correct answer is **D: WiFi-ga xawaaraha sare leh**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the core elements that make a B&B great – comfortable beds and a good breakfast. It emphasizes things like handcrafted or antique beds, seasonal food, and a nice atmosphere. 

Let's look at why the other options are more likely to be prioritized:

* **A: Alaabaha dalabaadka ee gaarka ah (Special order items):** While not directly mentioned, a B&B might offer special dietary options for breakfast, making this relevant.
* **B: Alaabta qadiimiga ah ee gaarka ah (Special antique items):** The passage *specifically* mentions antique beds and buildings with antiques as desirable features.
* **C: Goobaha dibadda ee sida fiican loo hagajiyay (Well-maintained outdoor spaces):** The passage mentions a landscaped property and potentially a swimming pool, indicating outdoor spaces are important.

**WiFi**, while often expected nowadays, isn't highlighted as a *defining* characteristic of a high-quality B&B in this text. The passage is all about the traditional comforts and experiences. Therefore, it's the least likely thing to be mentioned alongside a luxurious bed and breakfast.



"
"Iyada oo ku saleysan tuduca, Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan ka mid ahayn dhibcaha ugu muhiimsan ee tartanka u dhexeeya uxury-ga B&Bs?","The correct answer is **A: Qurxinta casriga ah**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the classic, charming aspects of a B&B: comfortable (often antique) beds, delicious breakfasts (potentially with local/specialty items), and historical or beautifully landscaped settings.  Modern decor doesn't fit this theme.

Let's look at why the other options are *mentioned* as important:

* **B: Tiro Quraac xilliyeed ah la bixiyo:** The text specifically states breakfast can include seasonal items.
* **C: Jiif aad u raaxo badan:** The passage emphasizes the importance of a comfortable bed (""hurdo raaxo leh"").
* **D: Cunto iyo cabitaan gudaha laga keenay:**  The text refers to breakfasts potentially featuring specialty items the host is known for (local produce, homemade goods).

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Midkee kuwan soo socda aan lagu qaban doonin Beijing sanadka 2022?","The correct answer is **B: Dhacdooyinka goobta ski Taizicheng**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Taizicheng is *located* in Zhangjiakou, which is 220km *away* from Beijing. While Taizicheng will host skiing events for the Olympics, the events won't be *in* Beijing.

The passage explicitly says that Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies and ice events. Therefore, options A, C, and D are all held in Beijing."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Midkee kuwan soo socda lagu qabani doonaa Beijing sanadka 2022?","The correct answer is **C: Ciyaaraha Olombikada jiilaalka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Magaalada Beijing ee China waxaa lagu qaban doona Ciyaarta Olympic Winter 2022..."" (Beijing, China will host the 2022 Winter Olympics...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ciyaaraha Olombikada xagaaga** - The passage specifically mentions Beijing *already* hosted the summer Olympics and this event is the *winter* Olympics.
*   **B: Dhacdooyinka barafka ee ka dhacaya gudaha** - While Beijing will host *some* ice events, it's not all of them. Taizicheng (in Zhangjiakou) will also host events.
*   **D: Xafladaha xidhitaanka** -  The passage says Beijing will host the opening *and* closing ceremonies, but the overall event is the Winter Olympics."
Yaa leh khatarta ugu badan ee uu ku qaadi karo hargabka avian?,"The correct answer is **C: Shaqaalaha digaaga**.

The text states: ""Badankoodu waxay la xiriireen dad ka shaqaynayay dhaqashada digaaga..."" This directly indicates that those working with poultry have the highest risk of contracting avian influenza.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Teeba oo ka mid ah bayaanada soo socdaa oo si sax ah u qeexaya hargabka shimbiraha?","Jawaabta saxda ah waa **C: Ilaaliyaasha shimbiruhu waxay halis ugu jiraan inay qaadaan cudurka**.

Halkan sababta:

*   Tuducu wuxuu sheegayaa in ""ilaaliyaasha shimbiruhu waxay sidoo kale khatar ku yihiin"" iney qaadaan cudurka.

Halkan sababta jawaabaha kale aaney saxayn:

*   **A:** Tuducu wuxuu sheegayaa in shaqaalaha digaaga ay sidoo kale khatar ku yihiin, laakiin ma sheego in kaliya ay iyaga ku dhacayso.
*   **B:** Tuducu wuxuu sheegayaa in kiisaska bini'aadamka ay aad u yar yihiin (ka yar kun), ma sheego in ay badan yihiin marka loo eego shimbiraha.
*   **D:** Tuducu wuxuu sheegayaa in qaar ka mid ah kiisaska khatar ay leeyihiin, laakiin ma sheego in dhammaan kiisaska khatar yihiin."
Muxuu isku xiraa kanaaliga Badda Cad ee Baltic?,"The correct answer is **C: Badda Arctic iyo Badda Baltic**.

The text explicitly states: ""Badda Caddaanka-Baltic-ga waxay isku xirtaaa Badweynta Arctic Ocean ilaa Badda Baltic..."" which translates to ""The White Sea-Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean to the Baltic Sea..."""
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Baabuur noocee ah ayaa laga yaabaa in baasaboorrada lagu qaado si aan loo joojin rakaabka?","The correct answer is **B: Tareenada habeenkii goobta hurdada leh**.

The text states: ""Tareenada habeenkii laga seexdo, basaboorada waxa laga yaaba inuu ka aruriyo karigu si aan hurdada laguu khiyaamin."" This directly indicates that passports might be collected on overnight trains to prevent passengers from missing their stop.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Diyaarado** - The text mentions immigration checks *after* exiting planes, but doesn't say passports are collected *on* planes.
*   **C: Maraakiibta** - The text mentions ships as a mode of transport where you'd go through immigration, but doesn't say passports are collected on them.
*   **D: tareenada xudduudaha gudba** - While border trains have checks, the text specifically mentions passport collection happening on *overnight* trains.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Goorma ayaa laga yaabaa in aqoonsigaaga lagu baaro tareennada xudduudaha isaga gudba qaarkood?","The correct answer is **A: Ka dib marka aad kaso deegto tareenka**.

The text states: ""Xuduudaha qaar kood tareynada waxa lagu hubiya iyado la wado tareyn ka adiguna waa in aad heysata kaar aqoonsi aan dhacsanen marka aad soo fuleyso tareynada mid ka mid ah."" This means your identification will be checked *after* you disembark the train at the border.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: adiga oo hurdaayo** - The text mentions the conductor might collect passports at night on overnight trains, but this isn’t a *check* of your ID, it’s just collecting it.
*   **C: Wax baaritaan ah lama sameeyo** - The text explicitly says checks *are* done at some borders.
*   **D: Marka tereenka uu ordaayo** - The text indicates checking happens upon disembarking, not while the train is in motion."
