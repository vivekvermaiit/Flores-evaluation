ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ነቲ ኣኮርዲዮን ብዕዉት መገዲ ንኽትጻወት ዘኽእለካ ቕኑዕ ምኽሪ ጌርካ ዘይርአ እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ጥንካረኻ ምእንቲ ክትዕቅብ ዘየድሊ ምንቅስቓስ ናብ ዝነኣሰ ደረጃ ኣውርዶ (Reduce unnecessary movements to avoid tiring yourself out).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""ንዅሉ እቲ መዘኻኸሪታት ብግቡእ ክትሃርሞ ኸለኻ ብኣጻብዕካ ብዙሕ ምንቅስቓስ ከይትግበር ጽዓር ። በዚ ኸምዚ ብእተኻእለካ መጠን ብዙሕ ኢኻ እትደክም"" (To play the keys correctly, avoid excessive finger movements. The more you move unnecessarily, the more tired you will become).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage says you *don't* need to use more force to get more sound from the accordion, like you would with a piano.
* **C:** The passage emphasizes *playing* the keys correctly, not just memorizing them.
* **D:** The passage mentions breathing techniques for *singing* alongside the accordion, not for playing it. It describes how to use your diaphragm to get more sound when *singing*, not when playing the instrument itself.



"
ኣኮርዲዮን ክትጻወት ከለኻ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣየኖት እዮም ነቲ ድምጺ ኸተዛይዶ ዝሕግዙኻ?,"The correct answer is **A: ዝያዳ ናህሪ (More bellows)**.

Here's why:

The passage directly states: ""ኣብ ኣኮርዲዮን ዝያዳ መጠን ድምጺ ምእንቲ ኺህልወካ ዝያዳ ጸቕጢ ወይ ፍጥነት ኢኻ እትጥቀም"" which translates to ""In an accordion, to get more sound, you use more pressure or speed.""  ""ዝያዳ ጸቕጢ"" means more bellows/air pressure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ዝያዳ ሓይሊ (More force):** While force is *involved*, the passage emphasizes the *mechanism* of bellows/air pressure.
* **C: ውሑድ ጸቕጢ (Less pressure):** The passage says *more* pressure, not less.
* **D: ውሑድ ናይ ኣጻብዕቲ ምንቅስቓስ (Less finger movement):** The passage actually warns *against* excessive finger movement, saying it leads to fatigue.

እቶም ኣብ ተለቪዥን ዝርኣዩ ስእልታት ስለምንታይ እዩ ወሰን ወሰኖም ዝቝረጽ?,"The correct answer is **A: ንኡስ ኣርእስቲታት ንምፍቃድ (To allow for subtitles)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that overscanning (ካብ መጠን ንላዕሊ ስካን) is done to ensure the entire image fits the electronic device (TV/DVD player). It then points out that when transferring to DVD, this overscanning can *crop* the bottom of the image, potentially hiding subtitles. This implies the overscanning initially exists to make space for those subtitles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: እቲ ስእሊ ነቲ እስክሪን ብምሉኡ ስለዝመልኦ (Because the image fills the entire screen):** While true, this is a *result* of overscanning, not the *reason* for it.
*   **C: ናብ ካልእ ዓይነት ቅዲታት ብቐሊሉ ንምቕያር ንምፍቃድ (To allow for easy conversion to other formats):**  The passage doesn't mention anything about format conversion.
*   **D: ንኡስ ኣርእስትታት ናብ ታሕቲ ኣመና ኣጸጊዕኻ ንምቝራጽ (To crop the subtitles to the bottom):** This is the opposite of what's happening - overscanning can *hide* subtitles, it doesn't intentionally crop them.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ሓደ ሰብ ንፊልም ናብ ዲቪዲ ኪቕይሮ እንከሎ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ጸገማት ኣየናይ እዩ ከጋጥሞ ዝኽእል?,"The correct answer is **A: ነቲ እስክሪን ብምሉኡ ዘይሽፍን ስእሊ**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that overscanning (ካብ መጠን ንላዕሊ ስካን) happens when transferring film to DVD, and it can cause the image not to fill the entire electronic device (like a TV). It also mentions that this can even happen when *making* a DVD, resulting in the video not being fully visible at the bottom. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ምቑራጽ ገለ ክፋላት ንኡስ ኣርእስቲታት** - While the text mentions subtitles *might* be affected, it doesn't say parts of them are cut off.
*   **C: ነቲ እስክሪን ብምሉኡ ዝሽፍን ስእሊ** - This is the opposite of the problem described in the text.
*   **D: ወሰና ወሰኖም ምቑራጽ** - The text doesn't mention any issues with colors or noise.



"
ናይ ብሪጣንያ መዓስከር ሰራዊት ኣበይ እዩ ነይሩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ኣሳንፒንክ ክሪክ (Assunpink Creek)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that General Ewing aimed to prevent the British troops from escaping *across the Assunpink Creek*. This directly locates the British forces near that creek.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ትሬንተን (Trenton):** Trenton is where the Americans attacked, not where the British were positioned to prevent escape.
*   **C: ቦርደንታወን (Bordentown):** This location isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **D: ፕሪንስተን (Princeton):** Princeton is also not mentioned in the context of the British troop's location.



"
ኣብቲ ብኢድ እተጻሕፈ ንድፊ ናይ መን ፌርማ እዩ ተረኺቡ?,"The correct answer is **A: ጆን ዱንላፕ (John Dunlop)**.

The text states the handwritten document was sent *to* John Dunlop, a printer, and the copies made were called ""Dunlap broadsides."" This means he was the one who received the original manuscript and printed the first copies. While others are mentioned (Hancock, Thompson, Washington, Nixon), they were not the recipients of the original handwritten draft."
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ቦታታት፡ እቲ ዱንላፕ ቦርድሳይድ መወዳእታ ኣበይ በጺሑ ነይሩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ለንደን**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ቅዳሕ ነሓሰ 10 ለንደን በጽሐ።"" which translates to ""November 10th London reached."" This means the Dunlap broadside arrived in London on November 10th.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኒው ዮርክ** - It was sent *to* New York on July 6th, but didn't end its journey there.
*   **B: ድኳን ሕትመት ናይ ዱንላፕ** - This is where it was *printed*, not where it ultimately ended up.
*   **D: ኣዳራሽ ሓርነት** - This is where it was first publicly read, but not its final destination mentioned in the text."
ወተሃደራት ኮነሬል ስታርክ ኣበይ ቦታ ሒዞም ነይሮም?,"The correct answer is **A: ብሸነኽ ሰሜን፡ ጥቓ እቲ ሓጹር**.

The text states: ""ናይ ስታርክ ወታደራት አብ ሰሜናዊ መወዳእታ ናይቲ ባዕዳዊ ዘሎ ቦታ በቲ ሓፁር ቦታ ሒዞም ይርከቡ።"" This translates to ""Stark's troops were positioned at the northern end of the wooded area by the hill."""
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ወተሃደራት ስታርክ ሓጹሮም ዘስፋሕፍሕዎ መዓስ እዩ ነይሩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ኣብ እዋን ትሑት ማዕበል**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""እቲ ንኡስ ማዕበል ብሚስቲክ ሩባ አቢሉ አብ ሰሜን ምብራQ ፔኒንሱዌላ ክፍተት ምስ ፈጠረ ብፍጥነት ነዚ ሓፁር ብሓፂር ናይ እምኒ መንደቅ ንሰሜን ገፅ እስካብ አብታ ፀግዒ ማይ ነሽተይ ገምገም አናዊሖሞ።""

This directly translates to ""The low tide, with a mystical rush, created an opening in the north of the peninsula and quickly expanded the barrier southward towards the shallow water.""  This shows the expansion of the barrier happened *during* low tide.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: እቶም ገዛእቲ ሓይሎም ክጠናኸሩ ጻውዒት ምስ ኣቕረቡ** - The text mentions the signal was given *after* the expansion, not before.
*   **B: እቶም ስሩዓት ነቲ ባላ ምስ ሓለፍዎ** -  This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **D: እቶም ወተሃደራት ንቅድሚት ክግስግሱ ከለው** - The text doesn't connect the expansion to the soldiers preparing for battle."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ሓደ ኻብቲ ኣብ ቻይና ዝነበረ ዓመጽ ዝመልኦ መዋእል ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **D: መዋእል ሰለስተ ምድረ-ነገስታት** (The Three Kingdoms period).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""ኣብቲ እዋን እቲ ኣብ መንጎ ሃንን ስርወ-ንግስነት ጂንን ን60 ዓመት ዝጸንሐ ሰለስተ መንግስትታት እዩ። ... እተን ሰለስተ መንግስትታት ሓደ ኻብቲ ኣብ ታሪኽ ጥንታዊቻይና ኻብ እተፈጸመ ኣዝዩ ደም ዝመልኦ መዋእል እየን ነይረን"".  This directly identifies the Three Kingdoms period as a very bloody period in ancient Chinese history.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ስርወ-ንግስነት ጂን** (Jin Dynasty) - The text mentions it *alongside* the Three Kingdoms period, but doesn't say it *was* the bloody period.
*   **B: መዋእል ሺኣን** (Xi'an period) - The text mentions Xi'an as the location of a palace where a large number of people died, but doesn't state it was a period of wide-spread conflict.
*   **C: ስርወ-ንግስነት ሃን** (Han Dynasty) - Similar to Jin, it's mentioned alongside the Three Kingdoms period, not *as* the bloody period."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ብዛዕባ ናብ ሰበኽ ሳግም ደረጃ ዝኣትዉ ሰራዊት ጻጸ ሓቂ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"Correct answer: **A: ኣብ እዋን ለይቲ ይሰፍሩ**

Here's why:

The text states: ""አብ ብርኪ ሰበኸ ሳግም ሰራዊት አብ እዋን ላይቲ ይዋፈሩ ቐትሪ ድማ ናብ ማዓሰከር ይምለሱ።"" which translates to ""Around the Sagm area, the army fights at night and returns to base during the day."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ውሑድ ቀረብ መግቢ ኣለዎም** - The text mentions a ""ሱጉምታዊ መድረኽ ይጅምር"" (a strategic stage begins) when food is scarce, but doesn't say they have little food generally.
*   **C: ድሕሪ 17 መዓልታት ዝቕየሩ ሰፈራት ይሰርሑ** -  The text says the journeys/campaigns last about 17 days, not that they perform settlements after that time.
*   **D: ኣብ እዋን ቀትሪ ይጓዓዙ** - The text specifically states they *return* to base during the day (ቀትሪ), they don't travel then."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ኣየናይ መግለጺ እዩ ነቲ ሰፈር ሰራዊት ጻጸ ኣብ እዋን ሰበኽ ሳግም ደረጃ ዝነበሮ ልምዲ ብልክዕ ዘንጸባርቕ?,"The correct answer is **C: መዓልታዊ ሰፈራቶም ይቕይሩ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ኣብዚ መድረኽ እዚ፣ እቲ ዕስለ መዓልታዊ ዝቕየሩ ግዝያዊ ሰፈራታት ይሰርሕ."" This directly translates to ""On this platform, daily changing strategic deployments are carried out.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣብ እዋን ለይቲ ሰፈራት ይሃንጹ** (They camp during the night) - While the passage mentions they return to base at night, it doesn't say they *camp* there. It says they ""return to camp"" implying a more established base.
*   **B: ከይሰፈሩ ን17 መዓልታት ይጓዓዙ** (They travel for 17 days without settling) - The passage states they last ""for about 17 days,"" but this refers to the duration of their operations including deployments, not just continuous travel.
*   **D: ኣብ ጻንሒት እቲ ደረጃ ሓደ ዓይነት ሰፈራት እዮም ዝጥቀሙ** (At each level, they use the same deployments) -  The passage specifically states the deployments *change daily*.



"
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ግዳማዊ ምልክታትት እናሃለወ ኽነሱ ዝቕጽል ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ስነ-ሂወታዊ ሰዓታት (Biological clocks)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...ሰዓታት ስነ-ህይወታውያን ርእሶም ዝኸኣሉ ተወዛወዝቲ ኮይኖም..."" which translates to ""...biological clocks are the main drivers...""  This directly links the behavior described in the passage to biological clocks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ብውሕሉል መንገዲ ዝግበሩ ውሽጣዊ ዑደታት (Internally driven cycles)** - While true, this is a broader description than the specific ""biological clocks"" mentioned. The passage focuses on the *mechanism* (biological clocks) driving the cycles.
* **B: በብእዋኑ ዝግበር ህርመታት (Timely actions)** - This refers to the *result* of the clocks, not the clocks themselves.
* **D: ዝተዓዘበ ህርመታት (Complex behaviors)** -  This describes the *outcome* of the biological rhythms, but isn’t the underlying cause.



"
እተፈላለየ ክሱት ባህርያት ዘንጸባርቑ ውልቀ-ሰባት እትገልጽ ቃል አየነይቲ እያ?,"The correct answer is **D: ፖሊይሞርፊክ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ግለሰባት ናይ ሓደ ውሱን ባህሪ ብዙሕ ፍልልያት ዘርእዩ ፖሊሞርፊክ እዮም።""  This directly translates to ""Individuals showing a lot of variation in a single trait are polymorphic.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ሞኖሞርፊክ** - The passage defines this as the *opposite* of polymorphic - meaning consistent traits.
* **B: ተህዋስያን** - This isn't related to the description of trait variation.
* **C: ጅር** - This translates to ""lineage"" or ""race"" and doesn't describe trait variation.



"
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ነቶም ፍሉይ ቦታ ዝሕዙ ተህዋስያን እትገልጽ ትኽክለኛ ቃል ኣየነይቲ እያ?,"The correct answer is **B: ህዝቢ (Population)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks for the term that describes groups of organisms inhabiting specific areas.** The definition of ህዝቢ (population) in the text directly states this: ""ህዝቢ ማለት ጥርኑፍ ጉጅለ ናይ እንስሳታት ሓደ ዓሌት ኣብ ዝተወሰነ ጆግራፊካዊ ቦታ ማለት እዩ።"" (A population is a group of organisms of the same species in a specific geographical area).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ሞኖሞርፊክ (Monomorphic):** This refers to organisms within a population being very similar in their characteristics, not the population itself.
* **C: ጅር (Species):**  A species is a broader classification than a population. A population *belongs to* a species, but isn't the term for the group in a specific place.
* **D: ፖሊይሞርፊክ (Polymorphic):**  This describes individuals within a population exhibiting a lot of variation, not the group as a whole.



"
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣብነታት ተፈጥሮ-መሰረት ዝገበረ ንጥፈት ቱሪዝም ዘይኮነ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ናብ ቤተ- መዘክር ስነ-ፍልጠት ምብጻሕ (Visiting an art museum)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes nature-based tourism** as revolving around observing and interacting with the natural environment - plants, animals, and ecosystems. Activities include hiking, fishing, birdwatching, and learning about nature.
* **Option C, visiting an art museum, is completely unrelated to nature.** It's a cultural activity focused on human-made art.
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **A: ናብ መንጫዕጫዕታ ዝግበር ናይ እግሪ ጉዕዞ (Hiking)** - This *is* a nature-based tourism activity, as mentioned in the passage.
    * **B: ናይ በረኻ ዕንበባታት ምስኣል (Wildflower spotting)** - This *is* a nature-based tourism activity, focusing on plants.
    * **D: ፍላይ ፊሺንግ (Fly fishing)** - This *is* a nature-based tourism activity, focused on interacting with the aquatic ecosystem.

Therefore, only visiting an art museum doesn't fit the definition of nature-based tourism provided in the passage."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ስርዓት መጓዓዝያ መሰረታዊ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ናይ ውልቀ መካይን (Private cars)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""ሰብ ግን ብናይ ውልቐ መኪና እዩ ዝጥቀም"" (people use private cars). This directly identifies private cars as a key component of the commuting system described. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ናይ ስራሕ መዓርፎታት (Work arrangements)** - While the text mentions commuting *to* work, it doesn't say work arrangements are a foundational part of the transportation system itself.
*   **C: ጽኑዕ ባዮስፊየር (Stable biosphere)** - The text mentions the biosphere being affected by emissions, not that it's a fundamental part of the transport system.
*   **D: ሰብኣዊ ፍልቀት (Human interaction)** - The text notes interaction happens *during* commutes, but interaction isn't the system itself.



"
እቶም ኣብ ኑክልየስ ዝዘውሩ ንጥረ ነገራት ኣየናይ ዓይነት ኤልክትሪካዊ ምልኣት እዩ ዘለዎ?,"The correct answer is **A: ኣወንታዊ ኤልክትሪካዊ ምልኣት (Positive electrical charge)**.

Here's why:

The text states that protons, which reside in the nucleus, have a positive electric charge. Neutrons have no charge. Therefore, the nucleus as a whole carries a positive charge due to the protons."
እቲ ኑክልየስ ብኣየኖት ዓይነት ንጥረ ነገራት ዝቖመ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ፕሮቶንን ኒውትሮንን**.

The text specifically states: ""ኒዩክለስ ክልተ ነገራት ዘዋሃደ እዩ -ኒዩትሮናትን ፕሮቶናትን።"" which translates to ""The nucleus is composed of two things - neutrons and protons.""

Therefore, the nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣብነታት ሓሙሽተ ቢት ክልተኣዊ ቝጽሪታት ዘለዎ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **C: 10010**.

Here's why:

*   **The text states:** Binary numbers are made up of only 0s and 1s.
*   **Option A (1010):** Contains only 0s and 1s.
*   **Option B (12001):** Contains '2', which is not a binary digit.
*   **Option C (10010):** Contains only 0s and 1s.
*   **Option D (110101):** Contains six digits, not five as specified in the question.

Since the question asks for a five-digit binary number, and only options A and C fit the definition of binary numbers, we need to look at the number of digits. Option A has only four digits, and therefore C is the only correct option."
ክልተኣዊ-ኣሃዝ እንታይ ተባሂሎም እውን ይጽውዑ?,"The correct answer is **A: ቢትስ**.

The passage explicitly states: ""ኣዞም ቁጽርታት ክልተኣዊ ኣሃዛት ወይ ቢታት እንትበሃሉ ንኮምፒተር ጃርጎን ንጥቀመሎም።"" which translates to ""These numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ቫልዩስ (Values):** While binary digits *represent* values, ""ቫልዩስ"" isn't the name of the digits themselves.
* **C: ጃርገን (Jargon):** Jargon is the technical language used, not the unit of information.
* **D: ፎርምስ (Forms):** This is unrelated to binary digits.

Here's why:

* **The text highlights these benefits of blogging for students:**
    * Improved writing skills (P: ""ብሎጋት ከምኡውን ናይ ተማሃሮ ናይ ምጽሓፍ ክእለት ንምምሕያሽ ክሕግዙ ይኽእሉ።"")
    * Enhanced critical thinking and analysis (P: ""ተማሃሮ ዝበለጸ ትንታነኣዊ ከምኡውን ገምገምቲ ክኾኑ የክእሎም።"")
    * Development of personal opinions and perspectives (P: ""ኣብ ፍሉይ ጉዳያት ናይ ባዕሎም ኣመለካክታ ምዝርዛር ይኽእሉ"")
    * Increased engagement with learning (P: ""ብሎጊንግ ምትሕብባር ዘተባብዕን ንተምሃሮ እውን ካብ ናይ ዝተለመደ ናይ ትምርሕቲ መዓልትታት ብተወሳኺ ንኽመሃሩ ዘተባብዕን እዩ።"")

* **Option B – receiving constructive criticism – is *not* explicitly mentioned in the text.** While blogging can *lead* to criticism (and potentially constructive feedback), the text doesn't state this as a direct benefit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ምምሕያሽ ሰዋስውን ናይ ምጽሓፍ ክእለትን (Improving writing skills):** This *is* mentioned in the text.
* **C: ናይ ከባቢኻ ኣፍልጦ ምስፋሕ (Expanding local awareness):** This is indirectly implied in the text's mention of understanding the world around them (""ንተምሃሮ አብ ከባቢኦም ብዛዕባ ዘሎ ዓለም ንከድሕኑ ምግዳድ”).
* **D: ምውሳኽ ብቐጻልነት ናይ ም"

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that blogging helps students ""ንኢንተርነት ንዋት ተግባራዊ ምላሽ ብምሃብ (to give practical responses to the internet)."" This is a direct connection to the idea of repeatedly engaging with tools online.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ነቐፌታ ክውገድ ዝግበር ድፍኢት (Courage to overcome criticism):** While the text mentions the importance of overcoming challenges, it doesn't specifically frame it as courage to face criticism.
* **C: ናይ ተዓዘብቶም ድልየት ምሕላው (Sharing their delayed development):** The text focuses on improving learning and critical thinking, not sharing developmental delays.
* **D: ክትተሓጋገዝ ምድላይ (The ability to collaborate):** Collaboration isn’t explicitly highlighted as a direct result of blogging in the text, although it’s an implied benefit of interacting online.

Here's why:

The text states that asynchronous learning *allows* instructors to deliver information at a faster pace and learners to work at their own pace.  Reducing speed is the opposite of this benefit.

Let's look at why the other options are benefits mentioned in the text:

*   **A: ንኢንተርኔት ከም ምንጪ ምጥቃም (Using the internet as a source):** The text directly mentions the benefit of ""unrestricted access to information at all times"" through the internet and worldwide web.

The passage describes sounds associated with a medieval tournament: a minstrel playing a rebec (a type of fiddle), the clang of swords, and the sound of someone emerging from a well.  A ""ዳጌት"" (daget) is a type of medieval drum, and its sound would absolutely be present at a tournament, adding to the atmosphere described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: ጎዳጉዲ በዓቲ (Godagudi Beati):**  This isn't a known historical object or sound associated with medieval tournaments.
* **B: ተዋጋእቲ ሰብ ፈረስ (Tewagae'ti seb feres):**  This translates to ""horseman fighters,"" which *are* part of the tournament, but it's a *description of people*, not a sound or object.  The passage focuses on *sounds*.
* **D: ፈረሰኛ (Feresegna):**  This means ""cavalryman"" or ""horseman,"" again describing a *person*, not a sound or object.

Here's why:

The text specifically states ""ናይ ምሕሳብ ክእለትና ኣብ ክውንነት እተመስረተ ድዩ ? ግምብታት እተሃንጸ ስለምንታይ እዩ ? ብኸመይ እዩ ተነዲፉን ተሃኒጹን ?"" and then continues with ""ኰይኑ ግና... ነቲ ኻብ ጕድጓድ ቤት ኤል ዚወጽእ ፍርሂ ኸተጨንቖ ትኽእል ኢኻ"".  This directly links the question of the nature of imagination to the *experience* of fear (fright - ፍርሒ).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ውግኣት (Battles):** While battles are mentioned as something remembered from the past, they aren’t directly tied to the questioning of the imagination's reality.
*   **C: ድግሳት (Celebrations):** Celebrations are mentioned, but not connected to the core questioning.
*   **D: ሸዀናታት (Songs):** Songs are a sensory detail, but don’t link to the idea of the imagination or the reason for the hallucinations.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""እቲ ዜብለጭልጭ መሳዅትን ቀጢን መናድቕን ነቲ ሓያል መጥቃዕቲ ንነዊሕ እዋን ኪጻወሮ ኣይክእልን እዩ ነይሩ"" (The impressive walls and strong defenses were not able to withstand powerful attacks for a long time). This means the castle was *intended* to withstand such attacks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ናይቲ ግምቢ ረጎድቲ መናድቕ ብንጉስ ሃስቲንግስ እዩ ተጠሊቡ** (The castle's rugged defenses were ordered by King Hastings) - The passage says Lord Hastings, not King Hastings, and doesn't focus on *ordering* the defenses, but the time period of the construction.
* **B: ህንጸት ኣብ ዝግበረሉ ዝነበረ እዋን እታ ሃገር ሰላማዊት ስለ ዝነበረት ብዙሕ ዕርድታት ኣየድልን እዩ ነይሩ** (Because the country was peaceful at the time the siege took place, it didn't need many reinforcements) - The passage states the castle was built to *defend* against raiders, implying a need for defense, not a peaceful time.
* **C: ህንጸት ናይቲ ግምቢ ኣብቲ እዋን እቲ ልሙድ ኣይነበረን** (The siege of the castle was not during its prime) - This is not mentioned in the passage.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ""ዜብለጭልጭ መሳዅትን ቀጢን መናድቕን"" (glittering armies and swift manouevres) were unable to keep the ""ሓያል መጥቃዕቲ"" (powerful attackers) at bay for long. This directly implies the presence and importance of large armies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: መጥቃዕቲታት ንምጽዋር ተባሂሉ ዝህነጽ መሰረት** (The basis for attacking) - The passage talks *about* attackers, but doesn't describe the reason *why* they attack.
*   **C: ካብ ቁሩባት ግምቢታት ውሑዳት ድፋዓት** (Few defeats from neighbouring castles) - The passage doesn't focus on defeats or specific castles.
*   **D: ቀጠንቲ መናድቕ** (Swift maneuvers) - This is mentioned *as part of* the armies, but isn’t the central topic of the passage’s description.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of a runner being able to run a mile in under two minutes.  The ability to run for three minutes (likely at a fast pace, implied by the rest of the text) would be a *highly* valuable measure of their potential.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብ ክረምቲ ጉያ ስግረ ዶብ ምልምማድ (Practicing jumping rope in the winter):** While jump rope might be part of training, it's not directly related to the core skill described - speed and endurance for mile running.
* **B: ስልጠና ክወስድ ከሎ ናህሪ ኣብ ምዅስኳስ ምትኳር (Hitting the target with a bow while training):** This is completely unrelated to running.
* **D: ላዕለዋይ ሰብነትካ ንምህናጽ ጂምናዝየም ምጥቃም (Using the gym to improve personality):**  The gym is mentioned in relation to a runner's full training regimen, but it doesn't directly measure the critical ability of quick mile time.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states ""ኣብ ክልተ ደቒቓ ክውድእ ዝኽእል እኹል ፍጥነት ክህልዎ ኣለዎ"" (it must have a speed that allows it to finish within two minutes). This is a critical characteristic of the best racehorses according to the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣብ እዋን ወርሓት ሓጋይ ጉያ ስግረ ዶብ ምልምማድ (training a horse during the month of Haga)** - The text doesn't mention anything about training schedules.

Here's why:

The passage states that consistent, proper training *doesn't just* improve physical strength and technique, but also has a significant impact on an athlete's **mental well-being and overall performance (increased ability)**.  The question asks what an athlete gains from training that goes *beyond* just the physical aspects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: እተመሓየሸ ብቕዓት (Etemehayeshe biq'at - Developed skill):** While training *develops* skill, the passage emphasizes a broader impact than just skill.
* **B: ዝያዳ ሓጎስ (Ziyada hagos - More joy):** While enjoyment is a *result* of success and training, it’s not the primary benefit mentioned in the passage as going beyond the physical.
* **D: ሓፈሻዊ ጥዕና (Hafeshawi t'ena - Physical health):** The passage *starts* by saying training affects more than just physical health – it's what it affects *in addition to* physical health that's important.

This directly relates to athletes enjoying their sport *more* through well-structured training. The passage emphasizes that effective training is key to both performance *and* enjoyment.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

*   **B: ብቐጻልነት ብዝለዓለ ደረጃ ምስራሕ (Continuous high-intensity training):** While intensity is mentioned, the passage focuses on *proper* routines, not just constant high effort.

*   **D: ጥዑይ ሓይሊ ሚዛን ምዕቃብ (Maintaining a good energy balance):** Like hydration, energy balance is important for performance, but not directly stated as the key to increased enjoyment.

* **The passage states:** ""ሚኽእሌታት ረብሓ ዋላ እንተዘይሃለዎ ምህርቲ ዘድልዮም ኮይኑ ይስመዖም እዩ"" (Athletes seek training even if it doesn't bring immediate benefits) and ""መብዛሕትኦም አብቲ ስራሕ ዘለዎም ፅልዋ ውሑድ ወይ ደማ ከቢድ ዝባሃል ኣይኮነን"" (Most don't consider the value of the work to be low or heavy). This implies a disconnect - they value the training even if the *tools* or *equipment* used aren't seen as particularly valuable.  The training itself is valuable, but the equipment isn't necessarily highly regarded. This is a contradictory view.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ውልቃዊ ምርጭኦም እዩ (It's their voluntary choice):** While athletes *choose* to train, the passage doesn't focus on the choice itself, but rather *why* they train despite potential drawbacks with equipment.

* **C: ንብቕዓቶም ብዓብይኡ ክጸልዎ እዩ (It's to improve their talent):** While improvement is a likely outcome, the passage emphasizes the *pursuit of training itself*, even without immediate gains.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: መሰረት ዘለዎ ስፖርታዊ ድሕረ-ባይታ** (A fundamental sporting background) - While a sporting background is helpful, the passage doesn't state it's *required*.
* **C: ኣዝዩ ቁሩብ መሳርሒ** (Very close tools) - This doesn't make sense in the context of running.
* **D: ብዙሕ ገንዘብ** (Much money) - The passage says athletes often don't receive benefits, implying it's not about money.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ድልየት (Difficulty):** The text doesn't focus on the difficulty of understanding actions.
* **C: እምነት (Belief):** While understanding beliefs is part of ""theory of mind,"" the text specifically highlights *purpose* as crucial for interpreting actions.
* **D: ግንዛበ (Knowledge):**  Knowledge is related, but understanding *why* someone is acting is more directly relevant to interpreting their actions.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that ""Theory of Mind"" (ዕላማ ምፍላጥ) helps us understand *why* someone might do something, not just *what* they are doing.  The example of the person trying to break into a car illustrates this.  We don't just see the action (breaking the window); we try to understand the *intention* behind it (stealing the car, or perhaps getting into their own locked vehicle). This understanding of intention follows the physical action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ድልየታት ይግምቱ** (guess desires) - While understanding desires is *part* of Theory of Mind, it's not the main function described in the text.
* **C: ንኻልኦት ሰባት ብዘይ ፍርዲ ይርእዩ** (see others without judgment) -  The text highlights how we *form* hypotheses about others' intentions, which can involve some degree of judgment.
* **D: ናይ ካልኦት ሰባት ኣእምሮ የንብቡ** (read others' minds) -  This is an oversimplification.  Theory of Mind isn't about literally reading minds, but about inferring mental states.

* **B: ድምጺ ምልላይ (Speech recognition):** Speech recognition is one *application* of AI, not the overall goal.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on *interpreting* micro-expressions in *real-time* to understand deception and human behavior.** It discusses how people can learn to read these subtle facial cues.
* Option A suggests learning from pre-recorded videos is a great tool. While videos *could* be used for learning, the passage doesn't emphasize this. It's about the natural ability and skill of reading live expressions.
* **Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:**
    * **B: ቅኑዕ ትርጉም ሓሶት ከለሊይ ይኽእል እዩ** (Accurate interpretation can prevent mistakes). This aligns with the idea that understanding micro-expressions can help detect lies.
    * **C: ዘረባን ኣብ ገጽ ዚንበብ መግለጺታትን ይትርጐም** (It interprets fleeting and facial expressions). This is the very definition of what micro-expression interpretation does.
    * **D: ቅንዕና ንምግምጋም ኪሕግዝ ይኽእል** (It can help confirm suspicion).  Oliver Sacks' example shows how recognizing micro-expressions can help people who can't rely on verbal cues to form opinions.

Therefore, **A** is the only option that isn't directly supported by the information in the passage. It's a general statement about learning, but doesn't relate to the specific topic of micro-expression interpretation.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on how the *way* knowledge is acquired and used has changed.** It states that the capacity for acquiring and learning knowledge has increased, and the methods for acquiring information are different. This points to a shift in *how* knowledge is transferred.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ናይ ውልቀ-ሰብ ተዘክሮ (Individual Memory):** While the passage mentions the lack of need to memorize things individually (because of written records), it doesn't say individual memory is more important. It says it's *less* needed.
* **C: ናይ ጽሑፍ ተዘክሮ (Written Memory):** The passage points to the *result* of written records (less need for personal memorization), but it's not the core change being discussed. Written records are a *tool* for the change, not the change itself.
* **D: ሓበሬታ ምርካብ (Information Gathering):**  The passage acknowledges that *how* information is gathered is different, but the central idea is the evolution of *knowledge itself* and the capacity to use it effectively.



Therefore, **B: ፍልጠት ምዝውዋር (Knowledge Transfer)** is the best answer as it encapsulates the central theme of the passage – the altered methods of acquiring, applying and sharing knowledge."
ብውጽኢት ተሃድሶ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣብ ኣየናይ እዩ ዝነኣሰ ትዂረት ተገይሩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ፍልጠት ምርካብ (Knowledge acquisition)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on how the nature of knowledge itself has changed.** It states that the capacity for learning and acquiring knowledge has increased, leading to a different kind of knowledge base than before. The core theme is a shift in *how* we gain and utilize knowledge.
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **A: ናይ ውልቀ-ሰብ ተዘክሮ (Individual memory)** - The passage mentions memory (specifically textual recording) but as a *result* of the change in knowledge, not the change itself. It contrasts a lack of past individual recall with the ability to now record information externally.
    * **C: ናይ ጽሑፍ ተዘክሮ (Textual memory)** - Similar to A, this focuses on a consequence (recording knowledge in text) not the root change.
    * **D: ምዝርጋሕ ሓበሬታ (Information distribution)** -  While implied, the passage is more about the *nature* of the knowledge being distributed, not the distribution itself.

The passage's central point is the evolution of *how* we acquire knowledge (ፍልጠት ምርካብ), driven by advances in learning and organization. Therefore, option B is the most accurate reflection of the passage's core message."

Here's why:

The text emphasizes the internet's role in connection, knowledge sharing, and community building.  It highlights how the internet facilitates interactions *beyond* immediate, physical relationships.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: መራኸቢ ንግዲ** (Supporting debates) - The internet is definitely used for debates and discussions.
*   **C: ጕዕዞ ምርምር ምግባር** (Conducting research) - The internet is a primary tool for research.
*   **D: ምስ ሓደስቲ ሰባት ምልላይ** (Meeting new people) - The internet facilitates meeting new people.

**P: (Translation)** The internet blurs the lines between public and private. The unique characteristics of the internet lead to different forms of presentation. For example, sharing knowledge and connecting with people are said to require morality when using the internet (James Etal, 1995). ""Increased participation"" and ""sustained connection"" by Egmin and McCord (1998) were found to be new challenges in responding to user demands of websites.

**Q: (Translation)** What is *not* a situation in which the internet can be used to facilitate sustained connection, as discussed in the passage?

Therefore, ""spending time with family at home"" doesn't rely on the specific connecting power of the internet as described in the passage, making it the correct answer."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ መዋእል ቢዛንታይን** - The text mentions Byzantium but says the Western powers began to assert themselves, not that it happened within Byzantium.
* **C: ድሕሪ ማእከላይ ዘመን ዳርጋ 25 ዓመት ዝኸውን** - This refers to the length of terms, not when Western Europe gained independence.
* **D: ኣብ መበል 11 ክፍለ ዘመን** -  The text states the Gotics were prominent from the 10th-14th centuries, but doesn't link the rise of Western Europe's autonomy to the 11th century specifically."

The text states, ""ሓደ ኻብቲ ኣብቲ ግዜ እቲ እተራእየ ዓበይቲ ምዕባለታት ሰባት ወተሃደራት ክርስትና ንምእጓድ መተርኣስ ኪጥቀሙ ጀመሩ"" (One of the major events of that time was people starting to use religious justifications to launch Crusades).  This directly links the use of faith to justify action with the Crusades.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ዘበነ ጎቲክ (Gothic style)** - While the text mentions the growth of architecture, it doesn't connect it to the use of faith to justify expeditions.
*   **B: መዋእል ቢዛንታይን (Byzantine structure)** - The text notes an early influence *from* Byzantium, but doesn't relate it to the Crusades.
*   **D: ማእከላይ ዘመን (Middle Ages)** - This is a general time period, not a specific result of using faith to justify travel.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes adapting to our environment, anticipating future problems, and building resilience.** This aligns with the idea of *changing behaviors* to cope with the world around us.
* **The passage critiques solely relying on psychological/behavioral solutions (""ዋሕደኛ ፍታሕ ጥራሕ እንተዘይደሊና..."")** It suggests that while these are *like* symptomatic treatment, they don't address the *root causes* of problems.
* **The passage highlights the significant changes brought about by science and technology**, and increasing complexity. This implies we're being pushed into ever more behavioral adaptations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ንጥፈታት ማሕበራዊ መራኸቢታት (Strengths of social connections):** While social connection is important, the passage doesn't primarily focus on this.
* **C: ጠንቂ እቲ ጉዳያት ምልላይ (Identifying the cause of problems):** The passage says behavioral solutions often *don't* identify root causes.
* **D: ተሓባባሪ ምንቅስቓስ ኣከባቢ ምዃን (Being an accompanying environmental movement):** The passage talks about adapting *to* the environment, not necessarily being part of an environmental movement.

Therefore, the passage suggests we are being encouraged to make excessive or exaggerated changes to our behavior to deal with a rapidly changing world."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብ ንጥፈታት ማሕበራዊ መራኸቢታት ምስታፍ (Participating in social movements):** The passage mentions engaging with the community but doesn't frame it as a *solution* separate from addressing the core issues.
* **C: ብዛዕባ እተጋነነ ኣነባብራ ርእይቶታት ምሃብ (Providing exaggerated/inflated perspectives):** The passage points to increasing complexity, not a need for distorted views.
* **D: ኣከባብያዊ ምሹእ ዝኾነ ናብራ ምንባር (Becoming a skillful navigator of community issues):** While the passage encourages being prepared and adaptable, it's again presented as a capability *to enable* solving the core problems, not a solution in itself.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""እቲ ኣብ ስጳኛ እተኻየደ ውግእ ቀንዲ ጕዳይ ሚዛን ስልጣን ዘስዓቦ ቐዳማይ ውግእ እዩ ነይሩ."" This directly translates to ""The war that took place in Spain was the first war whose main issue was the balance of power."" 

The question asks for the first war in Europe where the main issue was the balance of power, not religious ideas. The passage explicitly identifies this as occurring in Spain.



"

The passage explicitly states: ""ስለዚ እዚ ናይ ሰላሳ ዓመት ጦርነት ናይ መወዳእታ ሃይማኖታዊ ውግእ ተባሂሉ ተመግቡ።"" (Therefore, this Thirty Years' War was called the last religious war.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ኲናት ሚእቲ ዓመታት** - The passage does not mention a ""Hundred Years' War.""
*   **C: ተኸታታሊ ኲናት ስጳኛ** - While the Spanish war is mentioned as an early conflict about the balance of power, it's not called the last religious war.
*   **D: ኲናት ሓድሕድ ስጳኛ** - Similar to C, it doesn't fit the description in the passage.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly discusses the wealth of the Catholic Church and its accumulation.** It mentions how the Church received money as a means to alleviate suffering and poverty, but also how this wealth and power were questioned by many. The text implies a critique of how this wealth was *used* and *distributed*. The question of whether this distribution was *just* is a natural extension of this concern.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: ቀንዲ ሰረተ-ሓሳባት ሃይማኖት ይመሓየሹ እንተድኣ ነይሮም** (Whether the main beliefs of the faith were challenged): The passage doesn't suggest core beliefs were the main point of contention, but rather the *application* of those beliefs through wealth and power.
* **C: ኣብ ውሽጢ እቲ ቤተ-ክርስትያን ዝነበረ ማእከል ስልጣን** (The center of power within the church): The passage explicitly states the main center of power was in Rome, so this wasn't an unexamined issue.
* **D: ቀንዲ ሰረተ-እምነት ናይቲ ቤተ-ክርስትያን ይማላእ እንተድኣ ነይሩ** (Whether the basic tenets of the faith were consistent): Similar to B, the text focuses on practical issues of power and wealth, not fundamental doctrinal inconsistencies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሓንቲ ኻብተን ኣብ ዕዳጋ ዝነበራ ኣንስቲ** (One of the women in the mob) - The text specifically says a *member of the mob* (a male), not a woman.
*   **B: ንጉስ ሉዊስ XVI** (King Louis XVI) - The text says the mob was taunting someone *who had been killed* - they didn't kill the king.
*   **D: ሓደ ሓላዊ** (A nobleman) - The text says the mob member was taunting the *deceased* nobleman, not that the nobleman was the one who did the taunting.

Here's why:

The passage states that a member of the crowd showed the head of a loyalist killed in Versailles to Queen Marie Antoinette. This is the only instance described where the crowd directly inflicted psychological distress on the King and Queen without physical violence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: መስኰት ሰረገላኦም ኪኽፈት ከሎ** (When the reins of their carriage were being broken): This was an act of control and intimidation, but not direct torment.
*   **B: ካብ ቨርሳይል ብሃንደበት ምውጻእ** (Being forced out of Versailles): This was the beginning of their forced relocation, but not a specific act of torment *by* the crowd.
*   **D: ናብ ፓሪስ ንምምላስ እተገብረ ጉዕዞ** (The journey made to return to Paris): This is simply the act of traveling, not a tormenting event in itself.

Here's why:

The passage states that Britain anticipated Germany would offer a similar response to the unrestricted submarine warfare it was enacting, mirroring Britain's own actions. This anticipation stems from the fact that Germany hadn't strongly protested Britain's actions, suggesting a willingness to employ the same strategy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ዘይተሳተፋ መራኽብ ኣብ ጉድኣት ኣተዋ** (Neutral ships entered the trenches) - The passage discusses threats to neutral ships but doesn't say they *entered the trenches*.
*   **C: ኣብ ኣህጉራዊ ሕጊ ለውጢ ተገይሩ** (Changes were made to international law) - While the passage mentions international law, it focuses on Britain's strategy being *justified* by existing laws, not on *changing* those laws.
*   **D: ወሰንቲ ኣቕሑ ብቐሊሉ ክርከቡ ኣይኽእሉን ነይሮም** (Enemies found it difficult to counter the advances) - This isn't the main point of the passage. The passage focuses on the *strategy* and potential *response*, not the difficulty of countering it.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ብሪጣንያ ንጀርመን ካብ ባሕሪ ኸልከልታ እዚ ዕንቅፋት እዚ በቲ ኣብ ዝሓለፈ ኽልተ ዘመን እተገብረ እተፈላለየ ኣህጉራዊ ውዕላት እተኣታተወ ሓፈሻዊ ተቐባልነት ዘለዎ ኣህጉራዊ ሕጊ ዝጥሕስ እኳ ነበረ...""  This directly translates to ""This blockade by Britain against Germany violated international law as established by various international agreements made in the past two centuries...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ጀርመን ናይ ሳብማሪን ውግእ ክተካይድ ኣለዓዒሉዋ (Germany was expecting to reciprocate with submarine warfare):** While the passage *mentions* Germany anticipating a similar response, it's not the main point about the blockade itself.
* **C: ንዋሕዚ ቀረባት ኣቕሑ ጀርመን ኣቋረጾ (Germany broke the agreements):** The text doesn't say Germany broke any agreements, only that the blockade violated international law.
* **D: ገለልተኛታት መራኽብ ኣብ ሓደጋ ኸም ዘይኣትዋ ዘረጋግጽ ነበረ (It ensured neutral ships weren’t endangered):** The passage states the opposite - that preventing full access to the ocean (even for neutrals) was dangerous.

Here's why:

The text states that MS affects ""women, particularly those in their prime reproductive years.""  Option A (a 32-year-old woman) falls within that demographic.

The text also mentions MS is more common in women than men (""twice as likely""). While not directly related to the age in the options, this further supports a female answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ ወዲ 15 ዓመት ተባዕታይ:** The text doesn't suggest MS is common in teenagers.
* **C: ኣብ ወዲ 43 ዓመት ተባዕታይ:** While men can get MS, it's less common than in women.
* **D: ኣብ ጓል 10 ዓመት ኣንስተይቲ:** MS is rare in children.

*   **C: ጭንቀት (Depression):** While the text mentions mental distress, it specifically highlights the need for support *related to negative attitudes about trauma*.
*   **D: ፍርሒ (Fear):** Fear is mentioned in the text as a symptom, but the support needed isn't *for* the fear itself, but for how they view the traumatic experience."

Here's why:

The text explicitly states the sport is ""played mainly as a two-person team, with one aiming to knock the other down."" This directly answers the question of how the sport is most often played.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ብዘመናዊ መልክዕ** - While the sport is modern, this doesn't describe *how* it's played.
* **B: ብደረጃ ዩኒቨርሲቲ** - The text mentions university play, but it doesn't say this is how it's *most* often played.
* **C: ብደረጃ ኦሎምፒክ** - The text mentions Olympic competition, but not as its primary form of play.

Here's why:

The text states: ""The most serious sign of internal injury could be signs of internal poisoning, taking too much medication, or self-harm."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ዕግርግር ምባልን ረስኒን** (Dizziness and confusion) - While these *can* be symptoms of internal injury, the text doesn't present them as the *most* serious.
* **B: ተምላስን ረሃጽን** (Vomiting and diarrhea) - Similar to A, these are symptoms but not the most critical according to the text.
* **C: ምጭባጥን ከቢድ ቃንዛ ከስዐን** (Bruising and severe pain) - These indicate injury, but the text highlights poisoning/overdose as more concerning.

Therefore, **D** is the only option that directly corresponds to the most serious sign mentioned in the passage."

The text states: ""P: ነቲ ግዳይ ንምምርማር፣ ድሕነትካ ንምርግጋጽ ፈለማ ነቲ ቦታ ፍጻመ ክትምርምሮ ኣሎካ."" which translates to ""To investigate the crime, before you take any action to ensure your safety, you need to explore the area."" 

This clearly indicates that the first action to take when investigating a crime is to explore the area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ነቲ ግዳይ ምቕራብ (Approaching the victim):** The text doesn't mention this as the first step.
*   **C: ኣቃውማ ናይቲ ግዳይ ምጽራይ (Identifying the perpetrators):** Identifying perpetrators comes *after* investigation, not as the first step.
*   **D: ሓገዝ ተጸበ (Request for help):** While getting help can be important, it's mentioned as something you do *if* you get stuck, not the initial step.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes automatically avoiding approaching if a red flag is present.** The core of the instruction is to be cautious and not approach if something indicates danger (""red flag""). The purpose of the investigation is to *determine* if the area is safe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ናይ ገዛእ ርእስኻ ጉድኣት ኣብ ምጽዋር ኣይትጨነቕ (Don't worry about your own shortcomings):** This is irrelevant to the task of investigating and ensuring safety.
* **B: ቅድሚ እቲ ግዳይ ነቲ ስፍራ ገምግሞ (Examine the area before the task):** While good practice generally, it doesn't directly address the *automatic avoidance* of red flags mentioned in the passage.  The passage highlights what to do *during* the approach, not just beforehand.
* **C: ኣቃውማ ናይቲ ግዳይ ተዓዘብ (Seek guidance from the task owner):**  Seeking guidance is helpful, but the passage focuses on *your* ability to assess and respond to immediate dangers, not relying on others.

Here's why:

The passage states the French Revolution inspired people in other countries (the ""oppressed"") to start their own revolutions. This directly implies they *supported* the idea of governing themselves, meaning the revolution garnered support for change.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ትኹረት ካብ ደርቢ ናብ ውድድር ተቐይሩ (Focus shifted from rebellion to competition):** The passage doesn't say the focus changed to competition. It emphasizes the spread of revolutionary ideas.

* **B: ደርቢ (Debt):** The text mentions debt relating to France, but not as a reason for the soldiers' success.
* **C: ትምኒት (Ambition):** While ambition could play a part, the text focuses on actual achievement through hard work.
* **D: ኣፈሙዝ (Charm/Skillfulness):**  This isn't supported by the text.  The success is attributed to their ability to perform well in civilian professions, not personal charm.

Here's why:

The passage discusses problems with infrastructure like water supply and bridges in developing countries, and asks why infrastructure systems fail so often. The question specifically asks about a public service often cited as being deficient in developing countries.  Public transportation (ህዝባዊ መጓዓዝያ) fits this description perfectly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ጽሬት ማይ (Water Supply):** While mentioned in the passage as an example of failing infrastructure, it's not a *general* public service cited as being consistently lacking.
* **B: ህንጸት ቢንቶ (Waste Management):**  This is a service, but not usually the *primary* one discussed when talking about issues in developing countries.
* **D: ትምህርቲ (Education):**  Education is crucial, but the passage focuses on *physical* infrastructure failures.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses problems with public transportation systems:** It mentions issues like water shortages, broken bridges, and consistent failures in more developed countries.  This clearly points to systems that cause users frustration.
* **The passage questions *why* these systems fail:** The author is looking for the reasons behind the daily breakdowns and problems.  This implies the systems aren't working well for the people who rely on them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ብኹሉ እቲ ዝጥቀመሉ ሰብ ኣጸቢቖም ይፍተዉ እዮም** (Everyone who uses them praises them) - This is the *opposite* of what the passage describes.
* **B: ማዕረ ጽሬት ማይ ሕማቓት ኣይኰኑን** (They are not a source of water scarcity) - The passage mentions water shortages *along with* transportation issues, but doesn't directly link the two as a defining characteristic of the system itself.
* **D: ኣብ ኣብዛሓ ዝማዕበላ ሃገራት ናጻ እዮም** (They are free in more developed countries) - The passage doesn’t mention the cost of transportation, only its failures.

Here's why:

The text states that because drivers cannot perfectly predict the behavior of other vehicles (100% accuracy is impossible), controlling traffic flow is difficult and drivers exhibit a degree of uncertainty. This uncertainty *directly* impacts the *speed of movement* as drivers adjust based on perceived risks and unpredictability.

Let's look at why the other options are less fitting:

* **B: ናይ ጽርጊያ ውጥን (Driver's attention):** While attention is important, the text focuses on the *impossibility of predicting behavior*, not a lack of attention.
* **C: ናይ ጽርጊያ ስራሕቲ (Driver's actions):** The text describes the *outcome* of unpredictable behavior (adjustments in driving) but isn't about the actions themselves being problematic.
* **D: ዋሕዚ ምንቅስቓስ (Traffic density):** Density is a factor, but the core issue is the uncertainty in predicting others’ movements, which then influences speed.

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ስለዝኾነ'ውን ዋሕዚ ትራፊክ ውን ዝተወሰነ ርትዓዊን ውፁእ ዝኾነ ፀባይን ይህልዎም፣ ብግምታዊ ሒሳብ ከዓ ክውከሉ ይኸሉ እዮም።""  This translates to ""Therefore, traffic models also provide a certain degree of rational and complex behavior, allowing them to potentially predict to a certain extent.""  This directly connects traffic modeling to the **behavior of drivers**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ናይ ጽርጊያ ስራሕቲ (Road construction works):** While road construction affects traffic, the passage focuses on *modeling* traffic, and driver behavior is a core component of that.
* **C: ናይ ጽርጊያ ቅዲ (Road design):** Road design influences traffic flow, but it's not the primary factor being modeled in this context.
* **D: ጻዕቒ ምንቅስቓስ (Vehicle movement):** This is *a result* of driver behavior, not the element being modeled *by* understanding driver behavior. The passage emphasizes understanding the unpredictability of drivers to improve modeling.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ነቲ ዲኤንኤ መሸፈኒ ባክተሪያ ብሬዲዮ አክቲቭ ፎስፎሮስ ... ምልክት እናገበሩ ክልተ ፈተነታት ኣካይዶም እዮም።"" This directly translates to ""They labeled the DNA with radioactive phosphorus..."" 

The experiment used radioactive phosphorus to track the DNA and radioactive sulfur to track the protein. This allowed them to determine which one was actually entering the bacteria and carrying the genetic information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ናይ ዘርኢ መሳርሒታት (Inheritance factors):** While the experiment *relates* to inheritance, this isn't what they used to *mark* the DNA.
* **C: ጸርግር-ንጡፍ ሳልፈር (Radioactive sulfur):**  Radioactive sulfur was used, but to mark the *protein*, not the DNA.
* **D: ቫይረሳት (Viruses):** Viruses were used to *carry* the DNA, but aren't what was used to mark it.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ሚውቴሽን ከምኡውን ተደላዊ ህዋሳት ናይ ዓሌት-መስመር ህዋሳት እዮም። ብጀርም መስመር ዋህዮታት ውሽጢ ሚውቴሽን ጥራይ ናብ ቆልዑ ክሓልፍይኽእል...""  This means mutations in *germline cells* (the cells that produce eggs or sperm) are the *only* ones that can be passed on to offspring.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣገዳስነት ዘርኣዊ ነገራት (Severity of genetic effects):** While severity matters for the individual, it doesn't determine whether the mutation is heritable.
* **C: እቲ ናይ ምልዋጥ ዓይነት (Type of mutation):**  The type of mutation (point mutation, deletion, etc.) doesn't guarantee heritability.
* **D: እቲ ምልዋጥ ናይ ዋህዮታት ሞት ከስዕብ ዝኽእል እንተኾይኑ (If the mutation can cause cell death):**  Mutations that cause cell death are *less* likely to be passed on, as the organism may not survive or reproduce.  This is the opposite of what the question asks about - *successful* inheritance.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mutation has different types of traits, and in terms of genetic impact, it is either germline cells or somatic cells. Mutation in the germline can be passed on to offspring, while in other cases mutation can cause cell death or cancer.""

This directly addresses how *different types* of mutations lead to different outcomes (passed to offspring, cell death, or cancer). The question asks what determines the different consequences, and the answer is the *type* of mutation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: እቲ ዘርኣዊ መሳርሒ ክንደይ ዝኣክል እዩ ተጎዲኡ (How much the genetic material is damaged):** While the extent of damage *could* play a role, the passage focuses on *where* the mutation happens (germline vs. somatic) and the resulting consequences, not the degree of damage.
* **B: እቶም ዝተጎድኡ ዋህዮታት ደቀቕቲ ታህዋስያን እንተኾይኖም (Whether the damaged cells are young or old):** The passage doesn't mention the age of the cells, only the type (germline/somatic).
* **C: ኣገዳስነት ናይቶም ዝተጎድኡ ዘርኣዊ መሳርሒታት (The severity of the damaged genetic material):**  Similar to A, the passage emphasizes the *type* of mutation and its location, not how severe the damage is.

Here's why:

The passage states that early humans began to domesticate sheep for their ""meat, fur, skin, and wool.""  The primary reason for domesticating animals is often for their resources, and in this case, the passage highlights *meat* as one of the initial benefits.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: ነቲ መሬት ብመጋሃጫ ስለዘጽርያሎም** - The passage doesn't mention anything about sheep aiding in land cultivation.
*   **C: ምሕዝነት ክምስርቱ ስለዝገብራ** - While companionship is a factor in some animal domestication, the passage focuses on practical resources.
*   **D: ጸባ ክረኽቡ ስለዝገብሮም** -  While wool is mentioned, it's alongside other resources like meat, and meat is likely to have been the more significant initial driver of domestication.

Here's why:

The passage states golf is played by hitting ""ku'ssotat"" (balls) into holes. The goal of the game is to get the balls into the holes with the fewest strokes. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ስቶክስ (Strokes):** While minimizing strokes is *how* you win, strokes aren't the object being moved.
* **C: ግዜ (Time):** Time isn't the object of the game.
* **D: ጎዳጉዲ (Holes):** Holes are where you *aim* to get the balls, but they aren't what you're trying to reduce in quantity.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that a hypothesis is ""a proposed one or more speculative ideas to expand, question and solve."" The passage also emphasizes that testing, which is related to hypothesis, *guides* scientific practices.  Therefore, the aim of a hypothesis is to be tested and potentially *disproven* (refuted).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ዓለም ብኸመይ ከም እትሰርሕ ንምፍላጥ (To find out how the world works):** While science *ultimately* aims to understand how the world works, that's the goal of the scientific *method*, not specifically the purpose of a hypothesis itself.
* **C: ሕቶታት ንምሕታት (To solve questions):** Hypotheses are proposed *in order* to address questions, but solving is the result of testing the hypothesis.
* **D: ስነ-ፍልጠታዊ ምርምር ንምግባር (To conduct philosophical research):** The passage relates to scientific investigation, not philosophical research.

Here's why:

The text states the primary goal of science is to understand the world through a *scientific method*. It specifically mentions that this method guides most scientific research. It *also* mentions that *hypotheses* (guesstimates) and *tests* are part of this method.  

The question asks what *doesn't* help with scientific research according to the text. A ""philosophical method"" (ስነ-ፍልጠታዊ ሜላ) is not mentioned as a guiding force in the text.  The text focuses on the *scientific* method, not a philosophical one.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ትዕዝብቲታት ምግባር (Making observations):** The text implies observation is fundamental to understanding the world scientifically.
*   **C: ግምታዊ ሓሳባት ምውጋድ (Testing hypotheses):** The text explicitly states that testing hypotheses is a key part of the scientific method.
*   **D: ፈተነታት ምክያድ (Conducting tests):** This is also explicitly mentioned as part of the scientific method.

Here's why:

* The text states a *particularly strong* tornado lasts ""over three hours"". It *doesn't* say that *most* tornadoes last that long. It's an exception, not the rule.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: ህቦብላ ንፋስ ንዅሉ እቲ ኣብ ከባቢኦም ዘሎ ከጥፍእዎ ይኽእሉ እዮም** - The text explicitly states they can destroy everything in their path.
* **B: ህቦብላ ንፋስ ካብ ካልእ ህቦብላ ዝነኣሰ ኸባቢታት ይወቅዕ** - The text says tornadoes create a ""funnel"" and lift debris ""into the sky,"" implying they draw in and carry things from their surroundings.
* **D: ገሊኡ ህቦብላ ንፋስ ክሳዕ 300 ማይልስ ኣብ ሰዓት ኪነፍስ ይኽእል እዩ** - The text directly states they can have winds up to 300 miles per hour.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ዳርጋ 480 ማይልስ ኣብ ሰዓት ዝጓዓዝ ንፋስ ይፈጥሩ** – The text says speeds *can reach* 480 km/h (approximately 300 mph), not that they always do.
* **C: ካብ ካልኦት ማዕበላት ንላዕሊ ዓበይቲ ኸባቢታት የጥቅዑ** – While the passage says they cover large areas, it doesn't explicitly compare their size to other storms.
* **D: ኣእዋም ካብ ምድሪ ካብ ሱሮም ክብንቁስዎም ይኽእሉ እዮም** – The text mentions debris being lifted and carried away, but doesn’t specifically say they can lift objects from the ground to the sky.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ኮይኑ ግን ኣብ ኣውሮጳ ኣብ መወዳእታ 16 ክፍለዘመን ትኽክለኛ ቴሌስኮፓት ንፋልማይ እዋን ተሰሪሖም።"" (However, accurate telescopes were first made in Europe at the end of the 16th century.) This directly answers the question of what people began to do in the middle of the 16th century *leading up to* that achievement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ሌንሳት ምጥቃም (Using lenses):** People had been using lenses for centuries before the 16th century (stated as ""ሰባት ዓመታት ፀኒሖም"" - they have been using them for many years).
* **B: ነገራት ኣጒሉሕኻ ምርኣይ (Seeing things far away):** While telescopes *allow* this, the question asks what people started *doing* in the mid-16th century.
* **C: ሌንሳት ምስራሕ (Making lenses):**  Similar to A, lens making wasn't a new development in the 16th century.

The text states ""ደቂ ሰባት ሌንሳት እና ሰርሑን ከም መጉላህቲ እናተጠቀሙሎምን አሽሓት ዓመታት ፀኒሖም"". This directly translates to ""People used lenses and like spies for many years."" 

Therefore, people started using lenses to magnify things for *many years* before the telescope was invented.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the cave (""ሃይራ"") as a place of deep contemplation for Muhammad.** He would frequently retreat there.
* **The cave creates a complete sensory deprivation:** He cannot see the world, hear its sounds, or perceive anything outside of the cave itself. This isolation *allows* him to focus on spiritual matters and disconnect from the ""noise"" of everyday life.
* **This isolation is key to his spiritual experience.** It's where he receives his revelations and connects with the divine.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ንሰላምን ተነጽሎን ኣኽቢሩ እዩ ዚርእዮ (He sees it as peaceful and clean)** – While the cave might *be* peaceful, the passage doesn’t emphasize this. Its defining characteristic is its isolating nature.
* **C: ንበይኑ ኣዝዩ ቁሩብ ግዜ እዩ ዘድልዮ ነይሩ (It was a very close time for him)** - The passage doesn't imply a personal relationship with the cave itself, just its usefulness as a place for contemplation.
* **D: ኪርአን ክስማዕን ከሎ ይቑጣዕ ነይሩ (He was frustrated when seeing or hearing)** – The passage states he *cannot* see or hear from within the cave, not that he’s frustrated by it. It is a deliberate separation from the world.

*   **A: ንመስቀላውያን** (for people) - The text doesn't mention using iron for people.
*   **C: ንቸርኬታት** (for tools) - While iron is used for tools, the passage focuses on its application to carriages first.

Here's why:

The text states that iron rails were initially used to guide the wheels and reduce friction, allowing carriages to be pulled by horses at a *faster* pace.  The wooden rails were replaced by iron ones because the iron rails provided a smoother ride and allowed for increased speed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ዝያዳ ስሉጣት ጌርካ እዮም ዚርኣዩ ነይሮም (They looked more elegant):** The text doesn't mention aesthetics.
* **C: ዓበይቲ ጾር ኪስከሙ ስለዝኽእሉ (Because they could carry heavier loads):** The text focuses on speed, not load capacity.
* **D: በቲ ኣብ መንገዲ ባቡር ዝነበረ ሓጺን ይህሰዩ ስለዝነበሩ (Because they were worn down by the iron on the tracks):** This is the opposite of what happened; iron replaced wood to *avoid* wear and tear.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that technological determinism argues technology has a force *separate* from society and culture – it's not a *natural* outcome of them.  It suggests technology imposes itself on society (""ጽልዋ"" meaning influence or impact) rather than being organically integrated. 

Let's look at why the other options are reflected in the text:

* **A: ተክኖሎጂ ኣብ ሕብረተሰብ ዘሕድሮ ጽልዋ ኣብ ማሕበራዊ ዅነታት እተመርኰሰ እዩ** - This aligns with the passage's idea that technology's impact isn't just technical, but profoundly affects social structures.
* **B: ምዕባለ ተክኖሎጂ ብባህሊ ኣይጽሎን እዩ** - The passage discusses how technology can develop independently of cultural or political control.
* **D: ተክኖሎጅያዊ ምዕባለ ኣብ ፖለቲካዊ ጽልዋ እተመርኰሰ ኣይኰነን** -  This is supported by the text's claim that technology's influence extends beyond politics.



Therefore, only option C contradicts the core argument of technological determinism presented in the passage."

Here's why:

The text describes the ""ቀስቲ"" (slow) mark as resembling a square or rectangle, and specifies how to execute it. It also mentions the qualities of the sound produced when using ""ቀስቲ"" (soft, subtle).

Let's look at why the other options are related to the text:

*   **A: ዝፈኰሰ ድምጺ (exploded sound):** The text contrasts ""ቀስቲ"" with louder sounds.
*   **C: ዝሓየለ ድምጺ (strong sound):**  The text says ""ቀስቲ"" is *less* forceful, implying a contrast with stronger sounds.
*   **D: ካብ ቍርዖብ ጀሚርካ (from the fingers):**  The text explicitly mentions starting ""from the fingers"" when executing the ""ቀስቲ"" mark.

However, the text **doesn't** mention anything about a ""ጎባጥ ዝመስል ምልክት"" (dot-like mark) being associated with ""ቀስቲ."" It describes the sign as a square or rectangle.

The passage states: ""ቀስቲ መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ ልሙጽ ድምጺ ኼምጽእ ከሎ ቀስቲ ግን ዝያዳ ድልዱልን ድልዱልን እዩ"" (While a ""qusti"" usually carries a clear sound, ""qusti"" itself is more subtle and soft). This directly links the ""qusti"" mark with a softer sound.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ቀስቲ ምስሓብ:** The text doesn't discuss ""qusti mis'hab"" (qusti accompaniment).
* **C: V ዝመስል ምልክት:** This refers to the ""tahti qusti"" mark, but the text explains it's related to *direction* of the qusti, not the quietness of the sound.

ኣሰረ-ህይወት ከም ዝሕብሮ ኣብ መወዳእታኡ ኣእዳው ብቐዳምነት ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ነየናይ እየን ተለማሚደን?,"The correct answer is **A: ኣእዳው ምጥቃም (Using hands)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the changes in human hand structure (shorter fingers, opposable thumbs) reflect a shift in hand use *from* locomotion (moving around like chimpanzees) *to* manipulation (using hands as tools). The passage specifically mentions a change from using hands for walking/climbing to using them for ""mesrhi"" which means tool use.  The fossil record shows a development of hand use over millions of years. Therefore, the primary benefit of the evolved hand, as indicated by the text, is its ability to be *used* – to manipulate objects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ክብደት ምጻር (Bearing weight)** – The passage contrasts this with the new hand function.
*   **C: ምጉዓዝ (Climbing)** – Again, the passage indicates a shift *away* from climbing as a primary hand function.
*   **D: በኣእዳውካ ተደጊፍካ ምኻድ (Supporting oneself with hands)** - While hands can be used for support, this isn't the *primary* evolutionary development highlighted in the passage.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣቃውማ ኣዕጽምቲ ኣእዳው ናይ ቺምፓንዚ ብልክዕ ዚገልጾ ኣየናይ እዩ? ,"The correct answer is **C: ክብደት ንምስካም እዮም ዘገልግሉ** (They are used to support weight).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ናይ ቺምፓንዚ ኢድን እግርን ብ ግዝፍን ቁመትን ተመሳሰልቲ እንትኾኑ ፣ እዚ ከኣ ብእግሩ እንትኸድ ኢዱ ክብደት ንምልዓል ከምዝጥቀመሉ ዘንጸባርቕ እዩ።"" (Chimpanzee arms and legs are similar in length and proportion, indicating that while walking on all fours, they use their hands to support weight).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ካብ ደቂ ሰብ ንላዕሊ ትኽ ዝበሉ እዮም’ (They are stronger than humans):** The passage doesn't compare the strength of chimpanzee arms to humans.
* **B: ኣእዳዎምን ኣእጋሮምን ብዓቐን ይፈላለ እዩ (Their arms and legs are very different):** The passage explicitly states they are *similar* in length and proportion.
* **D: ብቐዳምነት ብኢድ ንምጥቃም እዮም ዘገልግሉ ነይሮም (They were primarily used for grasping):** The passage highlights the evolutionary shift *from* using hands for locomotion/supporting weight *to* using them as tools, but the current usage (as described) is for weight bearing when walking on all fours.



"
ምርጫ ሓድሽ ጂናዊ ምቅይያር ካብ ኣየናይ ጉድጓድ የወግድ?,"The correct answer is **A: ሕቡእ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ምዩቴሽን ሓዱሽ ልውውጥ ዘምፀአን ብምረፃ ካብቲ ለውጢ ንክውገድ ይገብር."" This directly translates to ""Mutation, by selection, can prevent new changes from occurring.""  The word ""ሕቡእ"" (hidden) refers to the fact that these mutations are not immediately visible but are being selected *against* to prevent changes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ዳግመ ምትሕንፋጽ (Dagme Mithenfas)** - This means ""re-inspiration"" or ""re-breath"" and has no relation to genetic selection.
* **C: ምፍልላይ (Meflallay)** - This means ""variation"" or ""difference,"" and while variation *exists* due to mutation, it isn't the mechanism preventing changes.
* **D: ተገሊጹ (Tegelitsu)** - This means ""revealed"" or ""manifested"" which is the opposite of what the passage describes (mutations being *removed* by selection).



"
ናይ ዘርኢ ለውጢ ኸም ዚህሉ ዚገብር መስርሕ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ምፍልላይ (Mutation)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ምዩቴሽን ሓዱሽ ልውውጥ ዘምፀአን ብምረፃ ካብቲ ለውጢ ንክውገድ ይገብር"" - This translates to ""Mutation brings about new changes and can be selected from to avoid the change.""  This directly links mutation to causing genetic variation and the potential for change within a gene pool.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ዳግመ ምትሕንፋጽ (Recombination):**  While recombination *creates* genetic variation, the passage describes the *origin* of the variation as a new change. Recombination shuffles existing variation, it doesn't create it from scratch. The passage mentions ""ፍልያን መሊስካ ድማ ምትሕውዋስን ኣብ ሞንጎ እቶም ክልተ ትውልዲታት"" which refers to recombination but doesn't present it as the initial source of the variation.
* **C: ምልዋጥ (Adaptation):** Adaptation is the *result* of variation and selection, not the source of the variation itself.
* **D: ተገሊጹ (Expression):** Expression refers to how genes are read and manifested, not the underlying change in the genetic code.



Therefore, **Mutation (ምፍልላይ)** is the only option that accurately describes the process of introducing new genetic differences."

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ውፂኢት እንስሳት (ፃጸ፣ ምስጥ፣ እንቁላሊሕ) ብቐሊሉ ዝብላእልዑ ጥራሕ ዘይኮኑስ ኩሉ ዘድሊ ኣሚኖ ኣሲድ ዝሓዘ ብጣዕሚ ዝላዓለ ፕሮቲን ይህቡ እዮ።""  This translates to ""Outputs of animals (flies, locusts, beetles) not only are easily digestible but also provide a complete and palatable protein rich in all necessary amino acids.""

The passage then connects this back to the ""ጸገም ፕሮቲን"" (protein problem) of our ancestors, implying insects were/are a solution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ዝሞቱ ኣቝጽልቲ (Dead scavengers):** The passage doesn't mention dead scavengers as a solution to the protein problem.
*   **B: ዘይበሰሉ ጥራምረ (Uncooked grains):** The passage highlights the difficulty in digesting plant-based proteins for humans, not uncooked grains specifically.
*   **D: ጉንዲ ዕምበባ (Flower buds):** These are not mentioned in the passage as a protein source.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ከበድቲ ሳዕቤናት፣ ከም ዝሕተላ ዕብየት، ዓጸቦን ኣብ መወዳእታ ድማ ዘይግዝያዊ ሞት ኣለውዎ።"" (Severe consequences like poor growth, weakness, and ultimately untimely death.) This directly links amino acid deficiency to these outcomes.
* **The passage specifically mentions:** ""ዝሕተላ ዕብየት"" (poor growth) as a consequence of not getting enough essential amino acids.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: ጉዳያት ምሕቃቕ ምግቢ** (feeding issues) – While the passage talks about the difficulty of getting adequate protein, it doesn’t specifically say feeding *issues* are a direct result of amino acid deficiency.
* **C: ጭንቀት ዘለዎ ዕቤት** (distressed appetite) – The passage doesn't mention appetite specifically.
* **D: ሞት** (death) – While death is a *final* consequence, the passage points to growth and weakness as earlier, more direct effects.  The question asks for what isn't a direct effect.



Therefore, **ጉድለት ኣመጋግባ (poor growth)** is the most accurate answer because the text directly connects amino acid deficiency to impaired growth in savanna animals."

Here's why:

The passage states that members of a subculture often express their belonging through ""fashion, behaviors and 'attitudes'"" that are *distinctive and symbolic*. This implies they create and adhere to their own set of standards and expressions—essentially a self-defined model—to identify each other and reinforce their group identity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ክትሓዋወስ ብምፍታን (By sharing stories):** While storytelling can be a part of a subculture, it's not the primary way members recognize each other.
*   **B: እምነት ኵሎም እቶም ኣብ ከባቢኦም ዘለዉ ሰባት ብምቕባል (Believing all the people around them):** This is the opposite of what a subculture does; it *differentiates* itself from the wider society.
*   **C: ማሕበረሰብ ዘውጽኦ ስርዓታት ብምቕባል (Accepting the rules imposed by society):**  Subcultures often challenge or deviate from mainstream societal norms.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""For example, children who belong to subgroups commonly seen as not doing well in school, by internalizing this group stereotype, may see signs of their academic failure.""  This means children who believe negative stereotypes about their group (like not being good at school) are *more likely* to struggle.
* **Option B directly reflects this:** It suggests the child will be more inclined to underperform.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A:**  The passage doesn't say the child will *avoid* tasks, only that they might do poorly on them.
    * **C:** The passage discusses academic performance, not necessarily social withdrawal.
    * **D:**  The passage focuses on *internalizing* the stereotype, not avoiding interaction with peers.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""These ingrained ideas influence their behavior."" (ህጽናት ናይ ዘርኢ ኣፈላልይ ኣራአያ ቀልጢፎም የምዕብሉ አና እዞም ዘርኢ ሓሳባት ኣብ ባህሪኦም ተጽዕኖ የሕድሩ አዮም።)  This directly links pre-existing beliefs to a person's character or how they act.
* **The example given:** Children labelled with a negative stereotype about learning ability may *show signs of underperforming* because of that label, impacting their behavior.  This shows how the belief shapes their actions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብ እቶም ክረኽብዎ ዝደልዩ ሒደት ዓሌታት (in the few stereotypes they encounter):** The passage implies the beliefs are *ingrained*, meaning they come from deeper than just a few stereotypes.

* **D: ኣብ ትርጉም ዓሌቶም (in their interpretation of stereotypes):** While interpretation is a factor, the passage emphasizes the *impact* of the belief itself, not how someone interprets it.

Here's why:

The text explicitly describes children who are socially withdrawn, unable to form social bonds, and often isolated (""feral"" children).  This is a clear indication of social anxiety or a significant difficulty with social interaction. The passage details how these children may have limited contact with people, and even display fear or mistrust like wild animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ብርእስኻ ምንባር (Selfishness):** The text doesn’t mention selfishness. It focuses on a *lack* of social connection, not a preference for oneself.
*   **B: ሓያል ናይ ምዝርራብ ክእለት (Strong ability to survive):** While some ""feral"" children might demonstrate survival skills, the text doesn't highlight this as a defining characteristic. It's more about the *cause* of their situation - lack of socialization.
*   **C: ንብሕቱ ናይ ምዃን ዝንባለታት (Desire to be with relatives):** The text implies these children *lack* connection to others, including family.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While physical impairments *can* be a cause, the text doesn't say it's the *main* cause or that it's the most common.
* **C:** The text mentions children who are mistreated by family, but it also discusses children who develop these traits for other reasons.  It's not limited to those who are abused.
* **D:** The text doesn't state that *all* harmful behaviors are due to severe mental disability.  It mentions that mental disabilities *can* be a factor in some cases, but it's not a universal truth.

Here's why:

* **The passage defines subsistence farming as focusing on growing enough food for the farmer's family.** It's about self-sufficiency.
* **Option C** directly contrasts this by highlighting a focus on *high yield* (ልዑል ምህርቲ), implying the goal is production *beyond* what the family needs – which is characteristic of commercial farming, not subsistence farming.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A:** Providing for the farmer's family is *central* to subsistence farming.
    * **B:**  While sharing food might happen, it's not the defining characteristic that differentiates it.
    * **D:** Using locally adapted seeds is *consistent* with the principles of subsistence farming as described in the passage.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes sustainable agriculture (መነባብሮኣዊ ሕርሻ) as a system that works *with* nature.** It emphasizes using locally adapted seeds, natural soil improvement methods, and minimizing external inputs. This aligns directly with being a ""completely natural system.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ምህርቲ የእኻል ንምምሕያሽ ፍሉይ ሜላታት እዩ ዝጥቀም (It uses different methods to improve soil fertility)** - While improving soil fertility *is* part of sustainable agriculture, it's not the defining characteristic that encapsulates the ""farm to table"" concept.
* **C: ነቶ ሐረስቶት የእኻሎም ኣብ ብምሉኡ ዞባታቶም ከካፍልዎ የኽእሎም (It allows farmers to fully share their resources)** -  The passage doesn't focus on resource sharing.
* **D: ኣብ ገለ ሃገራት ዝነብሩ ሓረስቶ ክሳብ ሕጂ ይጥቀምሉ እዮም (Farmers in some countries still use it today)** - This is a true statement according to the passage, but it describes the *prevalence* of the practice, not what the practice *is*.

The passage states: ""...እንተኾይኑ እዚ ዓይነት ቱሪዝም ባህላዊ ቱሪዝም ይበሃል።"" ( ""...if the aim of visiting certain places is to learn about their culture and history, this type of tourism is called cultural tourism."") Visiting a museum (ቤተ-መዘክር) is directly related to learning about the history and culture of a place.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ናይ ንግዲ ቱሪዝም (Recreational Tourism):** While museums can be enjoyable, the primary focus of recreational tourism is leisure and relaxation.
* **B: ናይ መዘናግዒ ቱሪዝም (Relaxation Tourism):**  This focuses on escaping daily life for rest and rejuvenation, which isn't the core purpose of visiting a museum.
* **D: ኣብ ግዳም ዝግበር ቱሪዝም (Adventure Tourism):** Museums generally don't involve adventure or physical challenges.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that relaxation tourism involves people ""intentionally escaping from their daily lives to a peaceful place to rest and recharge.""  This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: ኣብ ባህሊ እቲ ኸባቢ ምጥሓል (Exploring the culture of the area):** While cultural tourism *is* mentioned, it's described as a separate, more focused type of tourism. The main point about relaxation tourism is the escape and rest.
*   **C: ኣገደስቲ ገጽ-ምድሪ ምርኣይ (Seeing the largest landscapes):** The passage doesn't emphasize large landscapes as a priority for relaxation tourists. It mentions beaches, historical sites, and campsites – these aren’t necessarily the *largest* landscapes.
*   **D: ታሪኽ ናይ ሓደ ቦታ ምርዳእ (Learning the history of a place):** Again, this aligns more with cultural tourism than the general concept of relaxation tourism."

The text explicitly states that understanding the history of the organization (specifically, the successes and failures of past individuals) helps to overcome the fear of change and create a positive future trajectory. It mentions how revisiting these stories inspires new changes and encourages members to embrace a ""new spirit.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ዕዉት ጠባያት ናይ ንግዲ ስራሕቲ ምዝካር** - While the text *does* mention remembering past entrepreneurs, it's not the main point about overcoming fear.
* **B: ብዛዕባ እቶም ባህሊ ናይቲ ትካል ዝጸለዉ ሰባት ትኹረት ምርካብ** - The text focuses on *learning* from the stories, not just focusing on those who preserved the culture.

The text states: ""ናይ ሓደ ታሪኽ ምርዳእ ማለት ባህሊ ምርዳእ ማለት እኳ እንተዘይኮነ ግን እንተነኣሰ ኣብቲ ታሪኽ ዘለካ ግደ ክትፈልጥ ይሕግዝ። ... ከምዚኦም ዝመሰሉ ናይ ዓወት ታሪኻት ነቲ ናይ ለውጢ ፍርሒ የጉድልዎ...""

This directly translates to: ""Learning a person's history doesn't necessarily mean learning the culture, but if you understand the challenges in that history it helps. ...Like these successful stories, they reduce the fear of change...""

Therefore, understanding history helps overcome the fear of change (ፍርሂ ለውጢ ብምንካይ).

Here's why:

* **The passage argues against the idea of perfect or universally ""good"" ways to learn.** It specifically points out how much of what we learn through media like television is ultimately impractical - we don't actually *do* what we see. The passage concludes with examples of things we learn about but will likely never experience. This directly supports the idea that learning something even if you can't apply it is still valuable, reflecting the text's overall skepticism toward traditional learning goals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ሓበሬታ ክትመሃረሉ ብዙሓት ምንገዲታት ኣለዉ (There are many ways to learn information):**  While true, this is a very general statement and doesn't capture the core argument of the passage, which is the *limitations* of learning and the importance of experience.
* **B: ገሊኦም ተመኩሮታት ትምህርቲ ካብ ካልኦት ንላዕሊ ቀዳምነት ክወሃቦም ኣለዎም (Some learning experiences should be prioritized over others):** The passage doesn't talk about prioritizing experiences; it questions the value of many experiences, especially those gained passively.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  The passage doesn't mention reading for an hour before urinating.
* **C:** While waking up after 10 minutes is mentioned, it's about *extending* the time, not a method to stop urination.

* **The passage describes a method of interrupting the normal urge to urinate.** It focuses on techniques to delay urination, and uses the concept of distraction to override the body's signals. This is a process of *changing* the body's response to the urge.

* **B: እቲ ሽቶ ሙሉእ ብሙሉእ ባዕልኻ ንኽይትበራበር እዩ (It is to prevent you from emptying your bladder completely)** - The text *suggests* a full bladder can be used to help strengthen control, but the main point isn’t about preventing complete emptying.
* **C: እቲ መስርሕ ኣብ እዋን ስሩዕ ድቃስ እዩ ዝግበር (The process is done during normal urination)** - The passage is about *delaying* or *interrupting* urination, not performing it.
* **D: ምስተበራበርካ፡ እቲ ሽቶ ኣብ ውሽጢ ክልተ ሰዓት ተመሊስካ ምድቃስ እዩ (After urinating, it's about urinating again within two hours)** - The text doesn't mention a specific timeframe for re-urination.  It’s about extending the time *between* urges.

Here's why:

The passage states that the frequent recurrence of dreams is *caused by* the time gap between REM phases.  The passage explicitly links frequent dreaming to disruptions in the timing of REM sleep.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: መጠን ኩነታት REM (Amount of REM sleep):** While REM sleep is where dreams happen, the passage focuses on the *timing* between REM periods, not the quantity of REM sleep itself.
*   **B: መጠን ጸዓት (Amount of stress):** The passage doesn't mention stress as a direct cause of frequent dreams.
*   **C: ንውሓት ናይቲ ናይ ምሕዋይ ኩነታት (Changes in environmental conditions):** The passage focuses on internal biological factors (REM sleep cycles), not external environmental changes.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣሉታዊ ጽልዋታት ኣብ ሰውነትና ብተደጋጋሚ ክሕለም ዝፍተን ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ኣብ መንጎ REM ዝነበረ ንውሓት ግዜ ይንኪ** (It stems from the time gap between REM periods).

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""ናይ'ዚ ኽስተት ዋና ምኽንያት፣ ኣብ መንጎ REM እዋናት ዘሎ ናይ ግዘ ምንዋሕ ናይ ግሑዳት ሕልሚታት ውጽኢት እዩ።"" (The main reason for this problem is the time gap between REM periods, resulting in fragmented dreams.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ንሕድሕድ ለይቲ ዝበጽሕ REMs ይንኪ** (It stems from the REMs that happen every night) - While REM sleep happens every night, the passage focuses on the *gap* between REM cycles, not the cycles themselves.
* **C: ኣብ ምስ ውንኻ ከለኻ ሕልሚ ይምርኮስ** (It is triggered when you wake up) - The passage doesn't mention waking up as the cause.
* **D: ንሕድሕድ ለይቲ ዝበጽሕ REMs ይውስኽ** (It increases the REMs that happen every night) - The passage doesn't suggest that these fragmented dreams *cause* more REM sleep.

Therefore, option A accurately reflects the main point of the passage regarding the cause of frequent, unsettling dreams."

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""መብዛሕትኡ እዋን ካብ እቶም ናይ ስምዕነት ጉጅለታት ብዝበለፀ ነፃነት አለዎም እዩ"" (They usually have more independence than traditional groups). This directly supports option B.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A:** The text doesn't suggest all groups operate at the same level. It highlights differences.
    * **C:** While the text *mentions* a ""hidden group"" within online groups (the administrative structure), it doesn't say *both* types of groups are managed by one.
    * **D:** The text states online groups operate across different time zones, implying they *don't* necessarily share the same schedules.

The passage focuses on the increased autonomy of online groups compared to traditional, in-person groups, making option B the most accurate answer."

The passage specifically states: ""መብዛሕትኡ እዋን ካብ እቶም ናይ ስምዕነት ጉጅለታት ብዝበለፀ ነፃነት አለዎም እዩ።"" (They generally have more freedom than virtual groups).  ""ናይ ስምዕነት ጉጅለታት"" refers to internet-based groups in this context.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ልሙዳት ጉጅለታት መብዛሕትኡ ግዜብዝለዓለ ደረጃ እየን ዝተሓዛ** (Traditional groups are often more hierarchical) - The passage doesn't focus on hierarchy; it emphasizes freedom/independence.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣብ ናይ ትሕዝቶ ክልስ-ሓሳብ ዘተኮረ ዘኮነ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ውሽጣዊ ድልዬታት (Internal motivations)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that motivational theories focus on ""the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that drive people,"" and that these theories suggest people have ""a few underlying desires or needs"" that influence what they value and how they act.** This directly aligns with the concept of internal motivations – the desires and needs within a person that drive their actions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ምስ ዓበኻ ዝፍጠር ሓደስቲ ድልዬታት (New desires that emerge with experience):**  While experience can *influence* motivations, the passage emphasizes foundational, underlying desires, not solely those that are newly created.
* **B: ሓደ ከባቢ ንምንቅስቓሳቶም ከመይ ከምዝጸልዎ (How a surrounding influences their actions):** This focuses on *external* factors, whereas the passage is about what drives people from *within*.
* **D: ሰባት ዝፈትውዎም ነገራት ምርዳእ (Understanding what people prefer):**  Preference is a *result* of motivation, but not the core focus of motivational theories as described in the passage.  The passage is more interested in *why* people prefer things.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) focuses on composing a shot by placing the main subject in a visually impactful location, specifically using the ""rule of thirds"" or intersecting lines.**  It emphasizes finding the *most effective* place for the subject.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: እቲ ርእሰ ጉዳይ ኣበይ ክህሉ ከምዝኽእል መሰረት ምፍጣር (Establishing a foundation for where the main subject can be placed):** The passage isn't about *possible* placements, but finding the *best* placement.
* **B: ኣብ ውሽጢ ስእሊ ሂወትን ጸዓትን ምፍጣር (Creating life and atmosphere within an image):** While good composition contributes to this, the passage specifically addresses subject *placement*.
* **D: ኣብ ውሽጢ ስእሊ ስርዓት ምቛም (Establishing a system within an image):**  The rule of thirds *is* a system, but the passage is describing *using* the system to position the subject.

Therefore, **C** is the best match for the main idea of the passage – strategically positioning the main subject for maximum visual impact.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""The 35 millimeter frame, which is 36 millimeters wide and 24 millimeters high, gives an aspect ratio of 3:2. Most common aspect ratios (such as the shape of an Epson scanner) are square or rectangular."" This means 35mm film has a unique aspect ratio compared to many other common formats.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ገና ኣብ ምህርቲ እዩ ዘሎ (It is still in development):** The passage clearly states 35mm film is a historical standard, not something new.
* **B: ብዲጂታላዊ ቅዲ ካሜራ ተቐባልነት ረኺቡ እዩ (It has gained acceptance with digital cameras):** While digital cameras *use* the 35mm equivalent, the passage focuses on its original analog film context and doesn't claim it was initially accepted by digital cameras.
* **D: ኣብ ዓለም እቲ ኣዝዩ ልሙድ ቅዲ እዩ (It is the most common format in the world):** The passage states it *was* the standard, but that digital cameras have largely surpassed it, implying it's no longer the *most* common.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""እዚ ናይ ለንስ መግሉሒ ምስ ቀዋሚ አትኩራዊ ንውሓት ምስ ዘለዎም ሌንሳት ክወዳደር ከሎ ንጹርነት ዘለዎም ስእልታት ንክስርሑ ኣኽኢሉ እዩ."" (This lens advantage allows it to produce clearer images comparable to those of fixed focus lenses with excellent center sharpness.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ዝለዓለ ናይ ሌንስ ፍጥነት ኣለዎም** - The passage states the *opposite* for other types of lenses: ""ካልእ ናይ የዕብዩ ዘርኢ ሌንስ ድሑር ጎኑ እቲ ዝዓበየ ናይቲ ሌንስ ኽፍቲ ቀዳድ(ፍጥነት) ንእሽተይ እዩ."" (Other lenses have a slower aperture speed.)
*   **B: ትሑት ብርሃን ኣብ ዘለዎ ኩነታት ክትጥቀምሎም ዝቐለሉ እዮም** - While the lens is *good* in low light, the passage frames this as a *result* of its other properties (smaller aperture) rather than its primary advantage.
*   **D: ካብ ቀንዲ ሌንሳት ዝወሓደ ማእከል ሕልኽላኻት ኣለዎም** - The passage describes this as a characteristic of *lenses in general* (the introductory statement about lens construction) but not a specific benefit achieved by this lens in comparison to others.

Therefore, option C is the only one that accurately reflects the passage's description of how the lens's image quality compares to other lenses."

Here's why:

The text states that a separate lens is used to create a different focal length, allowing for a *shallower depth of field* compared to the standard lens.  This means the background will be more blurred, giving prominence to the subject. This is the primary reason for choosing a different lens as described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ዝወሓደ ባእታታት ሌንስ እንተድኣደሊኻ (If you want different lens elements):** While different lenses *have* different elements, this isn't the core reason given for switching. The focal length/depth of field is the key.
* **C: ኣብ ጸልማት መብራህቲ ክትጥቀም እንተዘደሊኻ (If you want to use it in low light):** The text mentions some lenses are better in low light, but this is a *characteristic* of a particular lens type, not the main reason for choosing a separate lens generally.
* **D: ዝያዳ ማእከል ሕልኽላኻት እንተደሊኻ (If you want more focal length options):** While having multiple lenses provides more options, the passage specifically highlights the depth of field change as the primary benefit.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the *experience* of mysticism as being characterized by joy and peace, particularly through contemplation.** It states ""...ፍሉይ ሕልና ኣብ ዘለዎ ዅነታት ብፍላይ ከኣ ኣብ ሰላማዊ ምስትውዓል ዘለዎ ሓጐስ"" (specifically, the joy found in peaceful contemplation).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While mystics seek spiritual truth, the passage focuses on *how* they seek it (through direct experience) and the *feeling* it creates, not the desire to learn.
* **C:** The passage implies that actions might be *part* of the path, but the core of mysticism is the direct experience, not the activities themselves.
* **D:** The passage explicitly states mysticism is *different* from other religious beliefs and practices due to its unique focus on direct experience. It's about *distinction*, not similarity.



Therefore, option A best captures the essence of what the passage defines as mysticism – a practice aimed at achieving peaceful and joyful states of being."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ናይ መንፈሳዊነት ትዂረት ዘይኮነ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ሓበራዊ ተመክሮታት ብምርካብ ምስዓብ (Gaining through social experiences)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that mysticism is about a *direct* personal experience with the divine, through intuition or contemplation. It's about a *private* connection. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ናይ መለኮታዊ ክውንነት ናይ ምፍላጥ ኽእለት ምድላይ (Seeking the ability to understand divine existence)** - The text says mystics *have* experiences of the divine, not just *seek* understanding.
*   **C: ኣብ ሓጎስ ዝመልኦ ኩነታት ሕልና ምትኳር (Focusing in a joyful mental state)** - The text mentions joyful contemplation as a way to *access* mystical experiences, so this is part of it.
*   **D: ብዛዕባ ኣምላኽ ንቑሕ ምዃን (Being certain about God)** -  The text speaks of experiences *of* God, or the divine, it doesn't say the goal is simply to be certain about God's existence.

Social experiences are the opposite of the individual, direct experience emphasized in the text. Mysticism is defined by a personal, internal journey, not one derived from external sources like social interaction."

The text states: ""the belief was that the people of Moriori came from mainland New Zealand, and established an agricultural society."" 

Therefore, according to the passage, the Moriori from New Zealand are the ones who initiated the agricultural society.

Here's why:

The text states: ""In the 19th and early 20th centuries, they were believed to be the first inhabitants of New Zealand..."" referring to the group who raised shorebirds (Moriori).  While the text details their later migration to the Chatham Islands, it explicitly identifies them as the *original* inhabitants of New Zealand.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P)** explains that flatbed origami allows for multiple copies to be made *at once* unlike traditional origami that requires individual folding.  John Smith used it to help those without press equipment or multiple motors.
* **The question (Q)** asks about a letterpress, which is a type of printing press.  
* **Option A** directly relates to the ability to make many copies simultaneously, mirroring the benefit of flatbed origami described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage doesn't mention motors being essential to the letterpress itself, only that Smith’s invention helped people *without* multiple motors.
* **C:**  While a letterpress *can* produce designs, the passage isn't focused on the artistic complexity of origami, but its replicability.
* **D:** The number of times a letterpress is tested is irrelevant to the core idea of simultaneous production.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ተመክሮ ንዘለዎም ዓጸፍቲ እተዳለወ እዩ** (It was developed for experienced folders) - The passage doesn't focus on the skill level of folders, but on the method's technical necessity.
* **C: ዕጻፍ ቀጥታዊ ቦታ ክህልዎ ኣለዎ** (The crease must have a straight line) -  The passage explicitly says *it avoids* folding along existing creases, meaning straight lines aren't a requirement, they're *avoided*.
* **D: ድሩት ክእለት ሞተር ንዘለዎም ዓጸፍቲ ዝኸውን ጽቡቕ ሜላ እዩ** (It’s a good method for folders who want to create complex models) - While the method allows for complex models, the passage focuses on the *reason* it was developed (for those without motors or many files) not the complexity it enables.

This directly indicates that some scholars believe the civilization is related to, or a continuation of, the Harappan civilization.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ሩባ ሳራስቫቲ** - While some scholars suggest the ""Indus-Sarasvati"" name, the text says this is a debate, not a definite connection.
*   **C: ኩሉ ዞባታት ሰሜናዊ ምብራቕ ኣፍጋኒስታን** - The text states the civilization *included* areas in northeast Afghanistan, it didn't *consist* of it.
*   **D: መብዛሕትኡ ናይ ዘበናዊት ፓኪስታን** - The text states it *included* most of modern-day Pakistan, but that's a geographical location of the civilization, not a civilization associated with it."

Here's why:

* The text states: ""ገሊኦም ግን ድሕሪ ሃራፓ ስልጣነ ሃራፓ ኢሎም ኪጽውዕዎ ኣለዎ"" - which translates to ""Some, however, prefer to call it the Harappa culture after Harappa."" This indicates that ""Sultane Harapa"" is a potential name for the civilization.
* The text explicitly mentions the other options:
    * **ስልጣነ ኢንዱስ-ሳራስቫቲ (Sultane Indus-Sarasvati)** - mentioned as a suggestion by some scholars, but not a definitively accepted name.
    * **ስልጣነ ሩባ ኢንዱስ (Sultane Ruba Indus)** - not mentioned in the text.
    * **ስልጣነ ስንጭሮ ኢንዱስ (Sultane Sinchiro Indus)** - is the initial name presented, but the text goes on to discuss alternative names.

Therefore, Sultane Harapa is the name from the options that could be used as a name for the civilization, but is not explicitly mentioned as the *definitive* name."

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the benefit of working together.**  It states that the person with a good idea should share it so many can benefit (""ብዙሓት ክጥቀሙ ከለዉ"") and that this leads to greater benefits for everyone (""ርእሲ ኣፍቃሪ ንግዚኡ ብዙሕ ክጥቀም ይኽእል እዩ"").

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ርእሲ ኣፍቃሪ ንግዚኡ ብዙሕ ክጥቀም ይኽእል"" which translates to ""A self-loving leader can benefit themselves greatly."" This implies that focusing on one's own benefit is a valid, and even advantageous, path.  The text then contrasts this with the idea of collaboration (""ካልኦት ሓቢርካ ምስራሕ""), suggesting a preference for individual gain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ናይ ባዕልኻ ጥቕሚ ዘይምቕዳም (Not prioritizing self-interest):** This is the *opposite* of what the passage suggests.
*   **B: ምትሕብባር (Cooperation):** The passage subtly contrasts self-interest *with* cooperation.
*   **C: ምትሕግጋዝ (Altruism):**  While the passage mentions ""ምትሕግጋዝ"" (altruism) it presents it as something many people don't realize the benefits of. It's not presented as the primary choice.

The text states: ""...the external and by Bank of Wall Street which was used to finance the government under the US government."" This directly indicates that the financing for the war effort was coming from banks on Wall Street. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: መንግስቲ ፊሊፒኒስ** - The text states the government *received* financing, it didn't *provide* it.
*   **C: ስርዓት መግዛእቲ ሕቡራት መንግስታት** - While the US government was in control, the text specifies the banks were the source of funds.
*   **D: ህዝቢ ፊሊፒኒስ** - The text indicates the people were *forced* to pay debts, not that they were funding the war directly.

The passage states that the Templar system originated *before* the High Middle Ages (roughly 1000-1300). It specifically says it arose ""in the early Middle Ages and extended into the late Middle Ages, reaching up to 1500.""  Therefore, the time *before* the Templar's peak would be the early Middle Ages.

The passage states the Templar order existed during the High Middle Ages (roughly 1000-1300) and that this period was *preceded* by the Early Middle Ages and *followed* by the Late Middle Ages, which extended to 1500. Therefore, the time *after* the Templar order’s peak would be the Late Middle Ages.

Here's why:

The passage states that Roman army medics used tourniquets and arterial clamps ""to save patients from gangrene."" This directly relates to controlling blood flow to prevent further damage, which is what applying pressure (like with a tourniquet) accomplishes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't mention any post-surgery pain management techniques.
*   **B:** While the passage *does* mention scopolamine, it doesn't say it was applied using fruit juice.
*   **D:** The passage mentions treating gangrene, but *with* tourniquets and clamps – it doesn't describe amputation (removing a limb) as a treatment.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses:**
    * **A: ምፍጣር ናይሕክምና ሰራዊት (Formation of medical corps):**  It explicitly states Romans were the first to systematically use medical troops after battles.
    * **B: ኣዕናዊ ወተሃደራዊ ፖሊሲ ሃጸያዊት ግዝኣት (Advanced military policy of the Roman Empire):** The text highlights the Empire's advanced military organization led to better medical care.
    * **D: ምምልማል ዶክተራት ብሃጸይ (Training of doctors by experience):**  It states surgeons learned by observing and practicing (likely through experience/apprenticeship).

* **The passage *does not* mention:** Any kind of formalized teaching hospitals or medical education institutions.  The learning seems to have been practical and on-the-job.

Therefore, **C** is the aspect of modern healthcare not reflected in the text's description of Roman medical practices."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: እቲ ኣካል ከማልኦ ዘለዎ ብቕዓት (The ability the component has):** While the passage mentions components have different abilities, it doesn't state that the *ability itself* is where visual ability focuses.
* **C: ንእተወሰነ ንውሓት-ማዕበል ዝስማዓካ ስምዒት (A limited input-output signal):** This refers to a detail *within* the system, not the focus *of* visual ability.
* **D: እተፈላለየ ደረጃ ብልሒ (Different levels of complexity):** Complexity is a characteristic of the system but not where visual ability originates.

Here's why:

The passage states that different sensors have different capabilities to detect various types of signals, different resolutions, different ranges, and different methods for processing output. This directly relates to the *capacity* or *ability* of the sensor itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ስምዒት ንውሓት ማዕበል (The perception of the flow of information)** - While sensors *contribute* to the perception of information flow, the difference between sensors isn't about how information is *perceived* but what they can *capture*.
*   **C: ደረጃ ብልሒ (Level of detail)** - Resolution (degree of detail) is *a part* of a sensor's capacity, but not the overall differentiating factor.
*   **D: ናይቲ ኣካል ሕልኽላኽ (The division of the component)** - The passage discusses differences *within* sensors, not how sensors are divided into components.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The text says the Guru is fundamental, but doesn't state it's *unique* to Sikhism; it's a fundamental concept across Indian religions.
* **C:** While the text mentions nine Gurus following Guru Nanak, this is a descriptive detail, not a defining concept.
* **D:** The text says some *practices* are rooted in Hinduism, but Sikhism is presented as a distinct religion.  It’s a result of a split *from* Hinduism, not simply based *on* it.

Therefore, the concept of the Guru is central and unique to the Sikh faith.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ልምዲታት ሂንዱ (Hindu practices)**: While Sikhism originated from Hinduism, the text emphasizes Sikhs see their religion as distinct, even while acknowledging its roots.
* **C: ንኻልኦት ሃይማኖታት ህንዲ ኣፍልጦ ምሃብ ምእባይ (Rejecting other Indian religions)**: The text doesn't mention Sikhs rejecting other religions.

The text states: ""ADD ዘለዎም ቆልዑ ከም ትምህርቲ ቤት ስራሕ ዘለዉ ነገራት ኣብልዕሊ ብምትኳር ብጣዕሚ ይጽገሙ"" which translates to ""Children with ADD struggle intensely with schoolwork.""

This directly explains that children with behavioral problems engage in dangerous activities as a way to cope and find relief (ልዑል ንጥፈታት ንምንካይ).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ምስ ምዛንኦም ርክብ ንኽገብሩ ንምሕጋዝ:** The passage doesn't mention needing to fit in with peers.
*   **C: ካብ ወለዶም ኣቓልቦ ንምርካብ:** While the passage mentions defiance, it doesn’t specifically tie it to rebelling against parents.
*   **D: ሓንጎሎም ንምንቕቓሕ:** The text doesn't suggest risky behavior is about releasing energy."

Here's why:

The passage describes scaffolding as something that *supports* learning, like assisting with new computer programs or new student orientations. It emphasizes providing prompts, feedback, and visual aids. It even compares a scaffolding teacher to a small paper-cutting person *within* Microsoft Office.

Let's look at why the other options are potentially scaffolding roles:

* **A: ኣብ መጀመርታ ትምህርቲ ዝወሃብ ናይ ኮምፒዩተር ጸወታ (A computer game given in initial learning):** A computer game used in introductory learning can provide scaffolding by gradually increasing difficulty and offering guidance.
* **B: ናይ SAT መምህር (An SAT tutor):**  An SAT tutor provides support and guidance to students preparing for the exam, helping them build skills and strategies. This is scaffolding.
* **C: ናጻ መደብ መጽናዕቲ (Free reading class):** A reading class, especially a foundational one, would involve scaffolding techniques to help students understand and analyze texts.

**However, a ""trainer of small gangs"" (ናይ ንእሽቶ ጋንታ ኣሰልጣኒ) has no connection to education or the supportive, guiding principles of scaffolding as described in the passage.**  It's an entirely different context and wouldn’t utilize those teaching techniques.

Therefore, option D is the one that is *not* an example of scaffolding."

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that scaffolding isn't a physical structure.** It's a metaphor for support, much like a temporary framework. The example of a Microsoft Word document used for a paper outline illustrates this – it's not a physical scaffold, but a conceptual one. The text compares it to ""intellectual scaffolding.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ካብ ሜላ ትምህርቲ ንላዕሊ ሓጋዚ እዩ (It's more than just teaching):** The passage doesn't state it's *more* than teaching; it describes what scaffolding *is* within the context of teaching.
* **C: ኣብ ጵሮጀክት እተመስረተ ትምህርቲ ትባሂሉ እውን ይፍልጥ እዩ (It also works well with project-based learning):** The passage mentions project-based learning but doesn't say scaffolding *specifically* excels with it; it's simply applicable.
* **D: መደያይቦ ኣብ መጀመርታ ተመኩሮ ትምህርቲ ደገፍ ንምሃብ የገልግል (Scaffolding serves to support the initial learning experience):** While scaffolding *can* help at the beginning, the passage indicates it's for supporting *new* experiences, which could occur at any point, not just initially (like a new computer program or a new student group).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that MySpace is helpful for students with reading and writing difficulties because it allows for easily sharing short texts, videos, photos, and other content.  It also mentions the ability to customize the text with different colors for easier reading. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ምትዕርራይ** (Interaction) - While MySpace *allows* interaction, the text focuses on how it helps with reading/writing specifically.
*   **C: ሓደ ኣድራሻ ወብ ሳይት** (One web address) - The ease of using a web address is a feature, but not the core benefit for struggling readers.
*   **D: 54 ሚሊዮን ድሕር ባይታ** (54 million profiles) - This is a statistic about the site's size, not how it assists learners."

Here's why:

The passage states the strikes in Poland in 1956 were against food shortages *and* low wages (ምንካይ ደሞዝ).  Khrushchev's response included concessions like giving in to some economic demands (ንገለ ቁጠባዊ ጠለባት ኣፍልጦ ምሃብ) and allowing a new Prime Minister (ሓዱሽ ቀዳማይ ሚኒስተር ምሻም) to be appointed, even using tanks to suppress the protests (ስርዓት ንምምላስ ታንኪታት ምጥቃም). 

However, the passage **does not** mention Khrushchev directly addressing and increasing wages. His response was to appease the situation by giving in to *some* economic demands, but not specifically by increasing wages.

Therefore, option C is the one thing Khrushchev *didn't* directly do as a response to the worker's uprising."

Here's why:

The passage clearly states the protests were an ""anti-communist outburst."" While food shortages and wage reductions *contributed* to the protests, the fundamental reason for the workers' uprising was opposition to the communist system itself.  The outcome - the replacement of a leader *within* the communist system - doesn't change the core issue that drove the rebellion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ሕጽረታት መግቢ (Food shortages)** - This was a *trigger* for the protests, but not the root cause.
* **C: ምንካይ ደሞዝ (Wage reductions)** - Similarly, this was a contributing factor, not the primary reason.
* **D: ሽመት ውላዲይስላው ጎሙልካ (Appointment of Władysław Gomułka)** - Gomułka's appointment was a *result* of the protests, not the cause.

* **The text explicitly states the following reasons for the conflict:**
    * Germany being a common enemy during WWII.

    * Becoming enemies after the war.
    * Proxy wars in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, etc.

* **Let's look at why the other options are *in* the text:**

    * **C: ዝተፈላልዩ መስርሓት (Different interests):** The proxy wars show the US and Soviet Union supported opposing sides, demonstrating differing interests.
    * **D: ብዛዕባ ስርዓታት ዝለዓል ዘይምስምማዕ (Disagreement on systems):** The text mentions disagreement on “system and belief” as a contributing factor.

* **The text *does not* mention cultural differences** as a reason for the conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States.  Therefore, ባህላዊ ፍልልያት is the only option that is not supported by the text."

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly states that the nervous system helps maintain homeostasis** by coordinating functions throughout the body.  It says the signals allow the body to ""maintain homeostasis"" (ይሕሉ።).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ዋሕዚ ደም ምንካይ (Blood circulation):** While the nervous system influences blood circulation, it's not *its primary* goal described in the passage.
* **B: ዋሕዚ ደም ምቁጽጻር (Blood clotting):**  This is a specific function, not the overall purpose the passage describes.
* **D: ኣካላዊ ስግኣት ከስዕብ ካብ ዝኽእል ነገር ምርሓቕ (Removing potential physical threats):** This is related to reflexes and reactions, but the passage focuses on overall balance and coordination.

**Therefore, C is the most accurate answer as it directly reflects the main function of the nervous system as described in the passage.**

And it goes on to describe the Giza plateau as holding many pyramids, smaller tombs, and the Sphinx. Therefore, Giza encompasses all seven wonders *as they were known in the ancient world*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: መቓብራት (Tombs)** - While Giza *has* tombs, it contains more than just tombs.
*   **B: ኣብያተ መቕደስ (Temples)** -  Similar to tombs, temples are *part* of Giza but don't represent everything.
*   **D: ዓብዪ ፒራሚድ (Great Pyramid)** -  The Great Pyramid is *in* Giza, but Giza itself contains much more.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the pyramid *is* one of the seven wonders, that's a result of its construction, not its primary purpose.
*   **C:** The text doesn't mention the pyramid serving as a land marker.
*   **D:** While there are many tombs in the Giza necropolis, the Great Pyramid itself was specifically for Khufu.

The text states ""ሰብ ኤፌሶን በዚ ስለ እተቘጥዑ ስም ሄሮስትራተስ ፈጺሙ ኸም ዘይተመዝገበ ኣፍለጡ"" which translates to ""The Ephesians were so upset by this that the name of Herostratus was completely erased from memory."" This clearly indicates that the people of Ephesus (ኢፊዝያንስ) were the ones who were angered by the destruction of the temple and thus, are the ones who sought to erase the perpetrator's name.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **C: ስታርቦ (Strabo):** Strabo was a Greek geographer who *recorded* the name, he didn't destroy the temple.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While Alexander offered money for rebuilding, the text says it happened *after* his death.
* **C:** The text mentions Herostratus's act of burning the temple, but doesn't say he was tasked with rebuilding it.
* **D:** The text states 323 BCE, not 320 BCE.

The question asks about the *first* time hominins started walking on two legs, and the text identifies *Sahelanthropus* as potentially doing so before seven million years ago. Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer."

Here's why:

The passage states that the German naval force used U-boats to try and ""devour this traffic"" (referring to American troops and supplies crossing the Atlantic). The plan was to disrupt the flow of resources to Britain, similar to how they were trying to starve Britain of supplies.  The intent was to cut off Britain and, as the passage implies, potentially force them to surrender.

*   **B: ብሪጣንያ ሰባት ከምኡዉን ጥረ-ነገራት ንኸይትቕበል ምኽልኻል (Preventing Britain and supplies from being accepted):** This isn't what they were actively *doing*; they were trying to *stop* the supplies from reaching Britain in the first place.
*   **C: ብኣትላንቲክ ንብረት ምስግጋር (Plundering assets in the Atlantic):** The passage focuses on disrupting the transport of people and supplies, not general plundering.
*   **D: ኣሜሪካ ሰባት ከምኡዉን ጥረ-ነገራት ንኸይትቕበል ምኽልኻል (Preventing Americans and supplies from being accepted):** While Americans were impacted, the broader goal was to isolate Britain, not solely prevent American aid.

Here's why:

The text states that Germany used U-boats to try and disrupt American ships and convoys crossing the Atlantic. It also mentions that Britain was a target of German aggression, similar to the rest of Europe. This indicates that both the Germans (as the aggressors) and the British (as a target and likely defender) were heavily involved in the naval struggle during the Battle of the North Atlantic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: እቶም ብሪጣናዉያን ከምኡዉን ኣሜሪካዉያን** - While Americans were targets, the text focuses on the German action *against* them and Britain.
*   **B: እቶም ጀርመናዉያን** - They were a major force, but the battle involved more than just one side.
*   **D: እቶም ብሪጣናዉያን** - The British were involved, but not exclusively."

The text states, ""ኮረቻ ገና ስለዘይተመሃዘ እቶም አስሪያን ካቫለሪ ኮሮቻ ብዘይብለን ፈረስ ይዋግኡ ነይሮም።"" This translates to ""Since saddles had not yet been invented, the Assyrian cavalry fought on horseback without stirrups.""  This directly implies that the *lack of stirrups* (ኮረሻታት) was a disadvantage when they first began using cavalry (horse-based military).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ቐስትታት (Bows/Arrows):** While the Assyrians used archers, the passage focuses on the *introduction of cavalry* and their initial struggles with it.
* **C: ሰረገላታት (Chariots):** The passage contrasts the use of chariots with the new cavalry - it doesn't say chariots were a disadvantage.
* **D: ድርዒ (Shields):** Shields were likely used, but aren't highlighted as the specific limitation of the early cavalry.

ናይ ፈረስ ሰራዊት ዝጥቐሙ ዉግእ ብኸመይ ይገጥሙ?,"The correct answer is **C: ኣብ ፈርስ ተወጢሕካ** (On horseback).

Here's why:

* The text states ""ካቫሊሪ ዝባሃል ብፈረስ ዝግበር ውግእ እዩ"" which translates to ""Cavalry is a war done on horseback.""  This directly defines what cavalry warfare involves.
* The text also mentions the Assyrians using cavalry, meaning they fought *on* horses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ብእግሪ (By foot):** This is the opposite of cavalry.
* **B: ብዘይ ድርዒ (Without stirrups):** While the text mentions Assyrian cavalry didn't have stirrups, fighting *without* them doesn't describe *how* they fought, only a detail *about* their fighting.
* **D: ብዉሑድ ቑጽሪ ወተሃደራት (With a large number of soldiers):**  The number of soldiers isn't specific to cavalry; any army can be large.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ማእከላይ ዜጋ ባቢሎናዊ ዘይትረኽበሉ ኣበይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **D: ናብ ዉሽጢ ቕዱስ ቦታ መስዋእቲ እንዳምጸአ**.

Here's why:

The text states ""ነፍሲ ወከፍ ቤተ መቕደስ ክፉት ኣጸድን ካህናት ጥራይ ክኣትዉሉ ዝኽእሉ ውሽጣዊ መቕደስን ነበራ.""  This directly translates to ""The inner sanctuary of the temple was sacred and only priests were allowed to enter."" 

This means ordinary citizens were *not* allowed to enter the inner, most holy part of the temple to offer sacrifices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ናይ ቐጽሪ ቤት-መቕደስ መስዋእቲ እንዳምጸአ** - The text mentions people bringing sacrifices *before* the idols, implying they could access the outer areas.
* **B: ኣብ ሓደ መሰረታዊ ቤት-መቕደስ ዝግበር በዓል ክሳተፍ** - The text describes festivals and rituals happening, suggesting participation.
* **C: ኣብ ቐጽሪ ቤት-መቕደስ ዝግበር ፌስቲቫል** - Similar to B, the text indicates festivals occurred in the outer temple area.



"
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ብፍሉይ ንኣቕሽሽቲ ዝምልከቱ ኣየኖት እዮም?,"The correct answer is **C: ጽምብላት (Rituals)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""እቶም ኣቕሽቲ ድማ ብ መንገዲ በዓላትን ጽንብላትን ኣቢሎም ድልየታት እቶም ጣዖታት ክፍጽሙ ይሙኩሩ"" which translates to ""The priests would also seek to fulfill the desires of the idols through festivals and rituals."" 

Therefore, rituals (ጽምብላት) are what the priests engaged in.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ፌስቲቫላት (Festivals)** - While festivals were *part* of the ceremonies, the passage specifically mentions rituals *alongside* festivals.
*   **B: ዉሽጢ ቕዱስ ቦታ (Inner Sanctuary)** - This describes a *location* within the temple, not an action performed by the priests.
*   **D: ዚጉራትስ (Ziggurats)** - These are the pyramids, part of the temple structure, not something the priests *do*.



"
ንጉስ ቱታንኩማን መዓስ እዩ ነቲ ሕማቕ ግብሩ ተፈላጥነት ዝረኸበ?,"The correct answer is **C: ድሕሪ ምርካብ መቓብሩ (After his tomb was discovered)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ይኹን እምበር ብ1922 መቓብሩ ምስ ተረኽበ ውሩይ ኮነ"" which translates to ""However, he became famous when his tomb was discovered in 1922"".  This directly links his fame to the discovery of his tomb.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ድሕሪ ምዝማት መቓብሩ (After his tomb was looted)** - The passage specifically states his tomb *wasn't* looted, making this incorrect.
* **B: ኣብ እዋን ግዝኣቱ (During his reign)** - The passage says he wasn't considered important during his time and wasn't well-documented.
* **D: ኣብ ዝርዝር ናይ ጥንታዉያን ንጉስ ድሕሪ ምስያሙ (After being included in lists of ancient kings)** - The passage says he wasn't included in many king lists.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ይኹን እምበር ብ1922 መቓብሩ ምስ ተረኽበ ውሩይ ኮነ። ኣብ ዝሓለፈ እዋን ዝነበረ ሓያሎ መቓብር እኳ እንተ ተዘምተ እዚ መቓብር እዚ ግን ዳርጋ ኣይተረበሸን።"" ( ""...but he became famous when his tomb was discovered in 1922. Although many tombs had been plundered in the past, this tomb remained intact."")
* This discovery is what made Tutankhamun famous and significant, despite his relative obscurity during his lifetime and lack of mention in many king lists.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ ዝርዝር ናይ ጥንታዉያን ንጉስ ዝነበረ ደረጁኡ (His position in lists of ancient kings):** The passage explicitly states he was *not* prominently listed in king lists.
* **C: ካብ መቓብሩ ዝተዘመቱ ብኣሽሓት ዝቑጸሩ ኢደ-ጥበብ (The intricate artifacts found in his tomb):** While the artifacts are amazing, they *resulted* from his fame due to the tomb's discovery, not the cause of it.
* **D: ኣብ እዋን ናይ ጥንታዊ ግብጻውያን ዘመን ዝነበሮ ጥቕሚ (His importance during the ancient Egyptian era):**  The passage states he wasn't considered particularly important *during* his time.

እቲ ናይ ግሪኽ ገጣሚ ሆመር ክገብሮ ዘይከኣለ ነገር እንታይ ነበረ?,"The correct answer is **A: ክሰምዕ (To hear)**.

The text states that Homer was a blind poet (""ዓይነ-ስዉር ገጣሚ""). This directly implies he couldn't see, but being a poet, his main function was to *recite* poetry, meaning he needed to be able to hear to create and perform.  The text doesn't say anything about his ability to read, write, or speak."
ካብ ስነ-ጽሑፍ ወጻኢ ዝፍለጥ ዉሩይ ግሪኻዊ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ፓይታጎሮስ**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that Pythagoras was a mathematician (""ናይ ሕሳብ ክኢላ"").
*   The question asks for a prominent Greek *other than* a writer/figure in literature.
*   Homer, Sophocles, and Aristophanes are all associated with literature (poetry and plays).

Therefore, Pythagoras is the only option that fits the criteria."
እቶም ስድራ ናይ ሀብሪው ዝበዝሐ ግዚኦም ኣበይ የሕልፍዎ ነይሮም?,"The correct answer is **C: ኣብቲ ግምቢ (in the courtyard)**.

The passage states: ""መብዛሕትኡ ህይወት ስድራ ቤት እብራውያን ኣብ ግዳም እዩ ኣጋጢሙ"" which translates to ""Most of the life of the Hebrew family was spent in the courtyard.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣብ ክፉት ቦታ (in a shady place)** - While the passage mentions shade, it doesn't say the family *lived* there.
*   **B: ኣብቲ ጎደና (in the storefront)** - The storefront is mentioned as being visible from the street, not where they lived.
*   **D: ኣብቲ ገዛ (in the house)** - While they *had* a house, the passage specifically states most of their life was in the courtyard.



"
ነቶም እብራውያን ስድራቤት ብዙሕ ኣገዳሲ ዘይነበረ ነገር እንታይ ነይሩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ቤቶም (their homes)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ኣብቲ ምዉቕ ሃዋህው ማእከላይ ምብራቕ እታ ቤት ክሳዕ ክንድቲ ኣገዳሲት ኣይነበረትን"" which translates to ""In that hot Middle Eastern climate, the houses were not large or important."" This directly answers the question of what the Israelites' homes lacked - size and importance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ክሊሞኦም (their clothes):** The passage doesn't mention anything about clothing.
*   **B: መኽዘኖም (their storage):** While they lived in tents, the passage doesn't specifically say they lacked storage.
*   **D: ኣኸሻሽና መግቦም (their cooking and eating):** The passage mentions women cooking, but that doesn't mean cooking/eating was something they lacked.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣብ መንጎ ስካንዲነቫዉያን ሃገራት ከም ፍልልይ ዘይገልጹ ኣየኖት እዮም?,"The correct answer is **A: እቲ ታሪኽ (The history)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...ኣብ መንጎ ህዝቢ ነገስታት ልምድታት ከምኡውን ታሪኽ ዴንማርክ ሽወደን ኖርወይ ኣይስላንድ ብዙሕ ፍልልያት ነይሩ ኢዩ።"" This directly translates to ""...between the people of the countries, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, there were many differences.""

The passage explicitly mentions that history is one of the things that differs among the Scandinavian countries.  The other options (land, customs, people) are also mentioned as differing, but the question asks for what is *not* a difference.  All of the options are differences.

However, reading the full text of the question, it seems to ask about what is NOT a difference. Since the passage states ""ብዙሕ ፍልልያት ነይሩ"" regarding history, customs, and people, none of the options are correct in the sense of being *not* a difference.

There appears to be a mistake in the question. But considering the wording of the passage and the question, **A: እቲ ታሪኽ (The history)** is the most fitting answer.
"
ኣብ ግሪንላንድ መጀመርታ ዝሰፈረ መን እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ቐቢላ እስኪሞ (Eskimos)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""እቲ ዝረኸቦ ርኽበት ብዘየገድስ ኣብቲ ግዜ እቲ ዓሌታት ኢስኪሞ ድሮ ኣብኡ ይነብሩ ነበሩ"" which translates to ""Even though he discovered the land, at that time the Eskimo people were already living there.""

This directly indicates that the Eskimos (Inuit) were the first inhabitants of Greenland. While Erik the Red later settled there with Norsemen, he didn't *discover* an uninhabited land.

ብዘይ ኮፍ መበሊ ክድረሩ ዝመርጹ ጉጅለ ኣየኖት እዮም?,"The correct answer is **C: ሃብታማት ሮማዉያን ኣሰብኡት**.

The text states, ""እቶም ሃብታማት ግን ምግቦም ኪበልዑ ኸለዉ ኣብ ጐድኖም ኰይኖም ድግስ ኪገብሩ ይፈትዉ ነበሩ"" which translates to ""However, the rich would lie on their sides and enjoy eating, holding feasts."" This clearly indicates that the wealthy Romans were the group who preferred to eat while reclining.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሃብታማት ሮማዉያን ኣንስቲ** - The text doesn't specify that *women* of the wealthy class were the ones reclining.
*   **B: ድኻታት ሮማዉያን ኣሰብኡት** - The text states the poor ate sitting, not reclining.
*   **D: ድኻታት ሮማዉያን ኣንስቲ** - The text mentions the poor eating seated, but doesn't specify it was the *women* of the poor class."

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that ancient Romans did *not* have foods like cocoa, tomatoes, potatoes, or maize.**  ""ዘውር እፉን፣ ኮሚደረ ይኹን ድንሽ ወይ ድማ ካካዋ ኣይኖበሮምን"" translates to ""They did not have things like tomatoes, corn, or cocoa.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ድኻታት ዕዱማት ኣብ ኮፍመበሊ ድራር ዝበልዑ (Poor people eating while reclining on couches)** - The text *describes* this happening.
* **B: መኽፈቲ ሸዉሃት ናይ ኣሮነ (Feasts of the nobility)** - The text *describes* how the wealthy held feasts.
* **C: ሃብታማት ኣሰብኡት ኣብ ግዜ ድራር ምግንባዎም (Wealthy people building feasts while lying down)** - The text *describes* this habit of the wealthy.

Therefore, only option D represents something the Romans wouldn't have had at their feasts, as the ingredients for such a dessert (likely involving chocolate or maize) were not available to them."

The question asks what, according to the description, *cannot* have lasting significance. The passage directly identifies smaller cultures as lacking the ability to become full-fledged civilizations due to their failure to maintain their history.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ማሕበረሰብ (Society):** The passage *defines* civilization as a complex society, so society itself isn't the thing lacking significance.
*   **C: ከተማ-ግዝኣት (City-states):** City-states are presented as *preceding* nations, not as lacking significance.
*   **D: ዝማዕበለ ባህሊ (Developed cultures):** The passage implies the opposite – that developed cultures *can* become civilizations by preserving their history.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ድሕሪ እቲ ሓዊ እቲ ዕርዲ ተዓቂቡን ተዓቚቡን እዩ"" which translates to ""After the war, the fortress was destroyed and rebuilt."" This directly implies that the fortress underwent significant reconstruction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ዓወት ናይ ሓይልታት ቲበታን-ሞንጎል ንምጽንባል ዝተሃነጸ ነበረ** - While the fortress commemorates a victory, it's not *defined* by that victory. The passage says it was built *to commemorate* the victory.
* **B: ኣብ ብሁታን ይርከብ** -  The passage states it's located in the Paro district *of* Bhutan, but that's a detail about its location, not a defining characteristic.
* **D: ብዝሃብድሩግ ነጋዋንግ ናምግይል ተሰርሐ** - The passage states it was *founded* by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, but doesn't say he personally built it.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""ብ1951 ከም ምስሊ ዛብድሩንግ ንጋዋንግ ናምጃል ዝኣመሰለ ቅርስታት ድሩክጊል ዶንግ ጥራይ ከም ዚተርፍ ዝገበረ ባርዕ እዩ ።"" (In 1951, it was reported that only relics resembling a portrait of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal remained at Drukgel Dzong). This directly answers the question about the outcome of the fire.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: እቶም ሓይልታት ናይ ቲበታን-ሞንጎል ተዓወቱ** (The Tibetan-Mongol forces were defeated) - This describes a historical event *before* the fire, not the result *of* the fire.
* **C: እቲ ተሳሓብነት ናይ ተፈላጥነት ኣይተተንከፈን** (The cause of the dispute was not resolved) - This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **D: ብዝሃብድሩግ ነጋዋንግ ናምግይል ተዓቒቡ ነበረ** (It was burned by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal) - The text says the dzong was burned *after* 1951, long after Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal's time.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ቬትናም ንካምቦድያ ወረርዋ (Vietnam invaded Cambodia)."" While it doesn't *directly* say they destroyed Phnom Penh, it's implied through the context of Thailand destroying it in 1772 and Vietnam also invading. Given the devastation caused by Thailand, it's plausible Vietnam also inflicted damage during their invasions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ካምቦድያ ኣብ 1772 ንታይላንድ ወረረታ (Cambodia invaded Thailand in 1772)** - The passage explicitly states Thailand invaded Cambodia and sacked Phnom Penh in 1772, not the other way around.
* **C: ኣብ መጀመርታ 18 ክፍለ ዘመን ካምቦድያ ብቬትናሚዝ ተወረት (Cambodia was invaded by Vietnam in the early 18th century)** - While Vietnam *did* invade Cambodia, the passage mentions it happening in the *late* 18th century, not the early.
* **D: እቶም ተያስ ንፎኖም ፈን ኣዕነዉዎ (The Thais destroyed Phnom Penh)** - While true according to the passage, the question asks for a statement about Vietnam.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: እቶም ተያስ ከምኡዉን ቬትናማዉያን ንካምቦድያ ኣብ 1772 ወረርዋ** - The passage states that *Thailand* (not ""ተያስ"") invaded in 1772, sacking Phnom Penh.  Vietnam's invasions were in the *later* years of the 18th century.
* **C: እቶም ቬትናማዉያን ንፎኖም ፈን ኣዕነዉዎ** - The passage says Thailand sacked Phnom Penh, not Vietnam.
* **D: ብዙሕ ግዜ ተያስ ንካምቦድያ ወረረታ** - While true (as the passage states Thailand repeatedly invaded), the question asks for what the passage says about *Vietnam*.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the Treaty of Shimonoseki ""made Taiwan a Japanese sovereignty until 1945."" This directly translates to Japan gaining control/authority over Taiwan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ስዕረት ጃፓን ኣብቲ ቐዳማይ ሲኒ-ጃፓኒዝ ኩናት** - The treaty was *a result* of the war, not the war itself.
*   **B: ደረጃ ናይ ታይዋን ኣብ ትሕቲ ንግስነት ኪንግ** - The treaty ended Qing dynasty rule over Taiwan.
*   **C: ናይ ታይዋን ክእለት ቑጽጽር ናይ ገማግም ባሕርታት ንኽትመልስ** - The passage doesn't mention this specifically. It focuses on the transfer of sovereignty.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states ""መጠን ፒኤች ብመጠን ሃይድሮጅን (ኤች አብ ፒኤች) እዩ ዝልካዕ"" (pH is determined by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH)).  Therefore, to determine the pH of a spice, you need to know the concentration of hydrogen ions within it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: እቲ ቐመም ማዕረ ክንደይ ቤዚክ ወይ ኣሲድ ምኹኑ (Whether the spice is acidic or basic)** - While pH *indicates* if something is acidic or basic, knowing *that* it's acidic or basic doesn't *tell you* the pH value.
*   **B: ኣብቲ ቐመም ክንደይ ዝኣኽሉ ፕሮቶናት ከም ዘለዉ (How many protons are in the spice)** -  The number of protons alone isn't enough. It's the *ionized* protons (hydrogen ions) that determine pH.
*   **D: ኣብቲ ቐመም ክንደይ ዝኣኽሉ ኤሌክትሮናት ከም ዘለዉ (How many electrons are in the spice)** -  The number of electrons doesn't directly determine pH.  pH is specifically about hydrogen ions (protons).



"
ካብ ሃይድሮጅን ኣዮናት እንታይ ተኣልዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ፕሮቶናት**.

The passage states: ""ናይ ሃይድሮጅን ኣዮናት ኤሌክትሮኖም ሙልእ ንሙልእ ክእለዩ ዝገበሩ ፕሮቶናት እዮም"" which translates to ""Hydrogen ions are protons that need electrons to be complete"". This directly links hydrogen ions to protons.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ፒኤች (pH)** - pH *measures* the concentration of hydrogen ions, it isn't what they *are*.
* **C: ኣልካላይን (Alkaline)** - Alkaline refers to basic substances, the opposite of acids.
* **D: ኤሌክትሮናት (Electrons)** - While hydrogen ions *need* electrons, they *are* protons, not electrons themselves.

This clearly indicates a significantly higher number of females than males.  Option B is therefore a statement *not* supported by the text.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

*   **A: ምስ ዕስለ ኣኻልብ ተመሳሳሊ ጠባይ የርእዩ** (They show similar behavior to hyenas) - The passage mentions they are collaborative and often have many relatives, similar to how hyenas are known to function.
*   **C: እቶም ተባዕትዮን ኣንስትዮን ብቐረባ ዝዛመዱ እዮም** (The males and females are closely related) - The passage implies this with the description of the pride as a close-knit group with many relatives.
*   **D: ቐተልትን ሕዉሳትን እዮም** (They are killers and protectors) - The text states they are fierce predators.

Therefore, option B is the only one that doesn't align with the information provided in the passage."

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that lions are *unlike* other big cats (""ብዘይትጽበዮ ልክዕ ከም ኣንበሳ(ዘይከምካልኦት ዓበይቲ ደማሙ) ብጠባይ ንግዳይዮም ኣዝዮም ቐተልቲ ኢዮም።"").  This directly contradicts option D.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: ኣዝዮም ሕዉሳት እዮም** - The passage states lions live in prides, which are close-knit groups (""እተን ደቀንስትዮ መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ ኣባላት ብዙሓት ኣሕዋትን ውላድን ዘለዎ ስድራ ኮይነን ነንሕድሕደን ዝቀራረባ እየን።"").
*   **B: ባህርያቶም ምስ ናይ ተዃሉ ዝዛመድ እዩ** - The passage describes a pride as having characteristics similar to a family (""ስድራ ኣንበሳ ከም ጉጅለ ናይ ተኹላ ወይ ከልቢ ዝተመሳሰለ ባህሪ ኣሎዎ።"").
*   **C: ተባሕትዮን ኣንስትዮን ንተሃዳናይ እንስሳ ኣዝዮም ቐተልቲ እዮም** - The text says they are cooperative hunters (""እተን ደቀንስትዮ...ዉላድ ኣንበሳ ዝቆመ ኢዩ።"").

መናቲለ ነየኖት ዓይነት ሃደንቲ እዮም ልሙዳት ዝኾኑ?,"The correct answer is **A: ንኣሽቱ ደማሙ** (the blood-sucking ones).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes mantiils as having a mid-level pressure sucking mouthpart that ranges from mantis to antelope and rabbits.** This clearly indicates they feed on blood.
* **The passage also mentions they harbor numerous smaller blood-sucking creatures, especially reddish blood-suckers.** This further supports the idea that mantiils are related to blood-feeding creatures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ንዓበይቲ ደማሙ (the ones with white blood):** The passage doesn't mention anything about the color of their blood.
* **C: ማእከላይ ዓቐን ንዘለዎም ደማሙ (the ones with mid-level suction):** While true, this describes *how* they feed, not *what* kind of creatures they are.  It's a characteristic, not a classification.
* **D: ዓጋዜናት (gazelles):** The passage specifically states they feed *on* gazelles and rabbits, not that they *are* gazelles.

This translates to: ""Beneath it, there is a mid-level predator that feeds on a medium-sized prey ranging from manatee to antelope and zebra, and there are also mid-level predators that change the medium-sized prey.""
* This directly indicates that manatees are part of the prey base for these predators.
* The question asks which animals *most often* provide blood for the predators. Since manatees are specifically mentioned as prey, they are the most likely answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣናጹ (Anacut)** - Not mentioned in the text.
* **C: ዓጋዜናት (Agazenaat)** - Not mentioned in the text.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that researchers believe ocelots use scent marking to communicate their presence and possibly to establish territories. This is a form of blending with their environment.
*   Option B (shita naī zīhadnūwō ʾinsasā mkhtal) – smelling prey – is *how* they hunt, not a characteristic unique to ocelots. Many predators do this.
*   Option C (zihadnūwō ʾinsasā ʾib ʾewān leyṭī mkhtal) – hunting prey at night – is also common to many predators, not specifically ocelots.
*   Option D (nʾaštu ʾinsasātāṭ ṭiray mḥdān) - only hunting small animals - The text says they hunt ""hbey, temen, anaṣun aʿwafn"" (hares, hyenas, monkeys, and birds) indicating a wider prey range than just small animals.

Therefore, **A** is the only characteristic specifically attributed to ocelots in the passage – their use of scent marking to blend with their surroundings."

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that researchers believe ocelots are *capable* of hunting animals, even tracking them and ambushing them.  It says they ""hunt by stalking their prey, camouflaging themselves in the dense undergrowth and then ambushing the animals they are pursuing.""  Therefore, saying their hunting ability is weak directly contradicts the text.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: ለይቲ ብጽቡቕ ክሃድኑ ይኽእሉ (They can hear well at night)** - The passage states they ""can cry out in the night."" While not directly stating *hearing* is good, it implies they are active and communicate at night, requiring good senses.
*   **B: ብጽሞና ይንቀሳቐሱ (They move quietly)** -  The passage states they can move ""slowly and silently.""
*   **D: ንኣሽቱ እንስሳታት ክሃድኑ ይመርጹ (They prefer to hunt small animals)** - The passage states they ""eat small animals, including rodents, opossums, and birds."" This indicates a preference for smaller prey.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that a leopard can ""hunt and overpower five strong men."" This demonstrates a strong hunting ability. The other options are less directly supported by the text:

*   **B: ምሑኻር (Digging)** - The passage doesn't mention digging.
*   **C: ምንጣር (Swimming)** - The passage mentions the leopard running long distances, not swimming.
*   **D: ምስሓብ (Friendship)** - The passage focuses on the leopard's predatory capabilities, not its social behavior.

Therefore, **hunting (ምግዓር)** is the skill most directly highlighted in the description of the leopard's abilities."

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""ነብሪ ክሓኩር(ዋላካ ብዙሕ ደኣ ኣይኹን እምበር)፣ክሕንብስ... ይኽእል።"" which translates to ""A leopard can climb (though not very high), jump..."".  There's no mention of climbing ability for the lion.  The text then contrasts the leopard's size to the lion, stating the leopard's size is more akin to a dog than a full-sized lion, implying differences in strength but not explicitly stating it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ድምጺ ናይ ኣገዓዕርኦም (Their vocalizations):** The text doesn't discuss the sounds they make.
*   **C: ክነጥሩሉ ዝኽእሉ ርሕቐት (The distances they can jump):** While the text mentions leopards can jump, it doesn't compare jumping distances between leopards and lions.
*   **D: ሓይሊ ናይ ስሕበቶም (Their strength of prey):** The text says leopards can bring down five strong individuals, but it doesn’t compare their hunting strength to lions.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""ንሱ ዝሞቱ ዋህዮታት ንምዕዛብ እቲ ቀዳማይ ሰብ እዩ ነይሩ"" which translates to ""He was the first person to observe dead cells."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ንሓደ ታህዋስያን ንምዕዛብ ማይክሮስኮፕ ተጠቒሙ** (He used a microscope to observe a living thing) - The text states he observed cork, which is not a living thing.
* **C: ንኣሽቱ ርቡዕ ኩርናዓት ተዓዚቡ** (He was amazed by small square units) - The text states he *saw* them, not that he was amazed.
* **D: ናይ ሓደ ታህዋስያን ዝነኣሱ ዝዓዩ ኣሃዱታት ረኺቡ** (He discovered small building blocks of a living thing) - He observed the structures, but the text doesn’t say he *discovered* them as building blocks. He observed what appeared to be empty compartments.

The passage states: ""እታ “ሴል” ትብል ቃል ካብ ላቲን “ሴላ” ዝነቐለት ኮይና ንእሽተይ ክፍሊ ማለት ድማ እዩ።"" (The word ""cell"" originates from the Latin ""cela"" which means a small compartment.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ክነፍሩ (to fly):** The text mentions some animals live in the sky, but doesn't say most animals can fly.
*   **C: ክሕንብሱ (to eat):** The text says animals eat, but doesn't state that *most* can eat. It says they consume things.

Here's why:

The passage states ""እንስሳታት ብዋህዮታት ዝቆሙ እዮም።"" which translates to ""Animals are composed of cells."" This means all animals *have* cells, but it doesn't say they have ""wahiyotat"" (ዋህዮታት). The question asks what some animals *don't* have, and the passage implies that having cells is a defining characteristic of animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ናይ ምሕቓቕ ክእለት (The ability to move):** The text states ""መብዛሕትኦም እንስሳታት ክንቀሳቀሱ ይኽእሉ እዮ።"" (Most animals can move), meaning the majority *can* move.
*   **C: ሓንጎል (Brain):** The text mentions some animals *don't* have brains (like jellyfish), which means not all have brains, but it doesn't say they lack this as a general rule.
*   **D: ናይ ምብላዕ ክእለት (The ability to eat):** The text states ""ነገራት ይበልዑን ኣብ ውሽጢ ድማ የሕቅቅዎምን"" (They eat things and digest them inside), meaning animals *do* eat.

The passage states: ""ኣትክልቲ ነቲ ምግቦም ካብ ጸሓይ ብፎቶሲንተሲስ እዮም ዚገብርዎ"" which translates to ""Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis.""  Photosynthesis is the process where plants use sunlight to create energy (food).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ጽላል** (Shade) - While plants *provide* shade, it's not what they use to make food.
*   **B: እንስሳታት** (Animals) - Animals *eat* plants, but plants don't get their food from animals.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on how populations become separated (by geographic barriers like islands) and adapt to different environments.** This separation and adaptation are the core of speciation.
* Option A is a *result* of the process, not the initiating event.
* Option C describes adaptation *within* the same environment, not the crucial separation needed for speciation.
* Option D is the *outcome* after a very long time, not the initial event driving the process.

The text explicitly states how isolation (moving to a new island) and a different environment (different resources, competition) drive changes in the new population, eventually leading to the inability to interbreed – speciation. Therefore, option B best encapsulates the initiating factor described in the text.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that speciation is *not* a dead end. It says, ""Speciation is often seen as a failure of gene flow and a surprisingly important part of evolutionary change.""  This means it's a *process* that drives evolution, not a termination point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሓድሽ ህዝቢ ክወሃሃድ ኣብ ዘይክእለሉ እዋን የጋጥም (When new populations cannot interbreed)** - This *describes* a key element of speciation (reproductive isolation), but doesn't explain the broader purpose or process. It's a condition *for* speciation, not speciation itself.
*   **B: ንመስርሕ ዕብየት ኣገዳሲ መዳይ እዩ (It is a critical field for the study of evolution)** - While true, this is a statement *about* the importance of speciation to evolutionary studies, not what speciation *is*.
*   **C: ንምምስራት ሓድሽ ዓልየታት ይምልከት (It leads to the creation of new species)** - This is a *result* of speciation, not the defining characteristic. The passage focuses on the reasons *why* it happens and its significance in evolution.



The passage emphasizes that speciation is an ongoing, important part of evolution, not a final, unproductive outcome. Therefore, option D is the only one that contradicts the text's explanation of speciation."

* **B: ካፒላሪታት (Capillaries):** Capillaries are the smallest blood vessels where exchange of nutrients and waste occurs, not the primary vessels returning blood to the heart.

* The question asks about the smallest blood vessels in the circulatory system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣርተሪታት (Arteries):** Arteries carry blood *away* from the heart, and are larger tubes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ቐረብ መግቢ (Close food):** Wing folding doesn't directly relate to finding food, although being able to reach small places *could* help find food. However, hiding is the more direct benefit mentioned in the text.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""ኣብ ኢጣልያ ዚርከብ ሃገራዊ ዅዕሶ እግሪ ምስ ሃገራዊ ጋንታ ዅዕሶ ጀርመን ኰይኑ ኣብ ዓለም ካልአይቲ ዕዉት ጋንታ ኰይኑ ብ2006 ከኣ ተዓወትቲ ዋንጫ ዅዕሶ እግሪ ዓለም ኰይኖም እዮም።""  (Italy's national football team, along with Germany's, was among the most successful in the world, and won the World Cup in 2006.)

The text only mentions a World Cup victory for football/soccer. It doesn't highlight any world-level achievements for the other sports listed."
ድሕሪ ኣየናይ ፍጻሜ እዮም ክፋላት ናይ ለግዝምበር በልግያን ዝተቐየረ?,"The correct answer is **B: ሰዉራ ናይ በልጋን**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""After the revolution in the 1830s, Luxembourg became Belgium."" This directly answers the question of when the parts of Luxembourg changed to being Belgian.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ቐዳማይ ኩናት ዓለም (World War I)** - The text mentions Luxembourg participating in both World Wars, but doesn't link them to the change in territory.
*   **C: ካልኣይ ኩናት ዓለም (World War II)** - Same as above.
*   **D: ምምስራት ሕብረት ኤሮፓ (Formation of the European Union)** - This happened much later and doesn't explain the original territorial change."
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ናይ ለግዝምበር ገለልትነት ዝጸለወ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ሰዉራ ናይ በልጋን (Independence from Belgium)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ድሕሪ እቲ ኣብ 1830ታት እተገብረ ሰውራ በልጅዩም ኰነ።"" (After the independence from Belgium in the 1830s, it became Belgium.)  This directly identifies the event that led to Luxembourg's distinct political identity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ሞያ ጀርመን (German Influence):** While Germany did exert influence and Luxembourg was involved in both World Wars alongside Germany, this wasn't the *source* of its separate identity.
* **B: ምጽንባር ናብ ሕብረት ኤሮፓ (Joining the European Union):** Joining the EU was a later development *after* Luxembourg had already established itself as a country.
* **D: ናጻ ሃገር ምዃን (Being a Free Country):** This is a result of independence, not the cause of it.  The passage says Luxembourg *attempted* to remain independent, but historical events led it to be connected with other powers.

ናይ ቱርኪ ጠቕላላ ከባቢ ክንደይ ዝኣክል ኪሎ ሜተር እዩ ኣብ ኤሮፓ ዝርከብ?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The text states: ""ካብዚ ድማ 755,688 ትርብዒት ኪሎ ሜተር (291,773 ትርብዒት ሚኢ) ኣብ ደቡባዊ ምዕራብ እስያ ኣብ ኤውሮጳ ድማ **23,764** ትርብዒት ኪሎ ሜተር እዩ።"" 

This directly answers the question of how much area of Turkey is located in Europe."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ቱርኪ ክንደይ ዝኣክል ስፍሓት ኣለዋ?,"The correct answer is **B: 9174**

Here's why:

The text states that Turkish territory covers 783,562 square kilometers in Southwestern Asia and 23,764 square kilometers in Europe.  Adding these together:

783,562 + 23,764 = 807,326 square kilometers. 

However, the question asks for the length of the Turkish coastline which is ""over 1,600 kilometers and 500 m.m. long"". This is equal to 1600 + 0.5 = 1600.5 km.

Looking at the options the closest is 9174. If we add the coastline length, and the European and Asian territories we get a total of: 

807,326 + 1600.5 = 808,926.5

None of the options are correct. The closest and most relevant answer would be option B: 9174.

The passage states: ""ላቲን ኣብ ሃይማኖታዊ በዓላት ይጥቀም (Latin is used in religious ceremonies).""  The other options are incorrect based on the provided text."
ኣብ ከተማ ቫቲካን፡ ጥልያን ዘይገልግለሉ ዝነበረ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **D: ናይ መዓልታዊ ዝርርብ (Daily Language)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Italian is used as the daily language by most residents, even though Latin is used for religious ceremonies. This indicates Italian is the primary language for everyday communication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሕጋግ (Laws)** - The passage states Vatican City uses Italian laws.
*   **B: ወግዓዊ ዝርርብ (Official Status)** - Italian has an official role.
*   **C: ሃይማኖታዊ ጽምብላት (Religious Ceremonies)** - Latin is used for these, not as something not used by the people.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ሙዚቓ ድምፂ ንምምፃእን ንምውዳድን መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ ብኮምፑተራት ይቕዳሕ"" (Music is often recorded on computers for composition and editing). This directly links computers to the processing of sound/music.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ስእላዊ ፊሊማት (Animated films):** The text mentions animated films *use* computers, but doesn't say computers are *needed to create the sound* for them.
* **C: ስእልታት (Images):**  The text mentions computers are used with images, but not for manipulating the sound *of* the images.
* **D: ትሕቲ-ቕርጺ (Subtitles):**  Subtitles are text and aren't directly related to sound processing.

The text states: ""ከተማታት ሃራፓ ንሞሀንጆ-ዳሮን ዳርጋ ኣብ ነፍሲ ወከፍ ቤት እተራቐቐ ረሳሕ ፈሳሲ ዚኸደሉ ትቦ ዘለዎ ዓይኒ ምድሪ ነበራ."" This translates to ""The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a sophisticated drainage system with covered drains in each house.""  Therefore, Mohenjo-Daro is specifically mentioned as having this feature.
"
ዝማዕበሉ ናይ ጎሓፍ መስርሓት ዝርከብዎም ኣየኖት ቦታታት እዮም?,"The correct answer is **A: ሃራፓ**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had well-planned drainage systems with covered drains and toilets within houses. The other options (Santorini, Egypt, and China) are mentioned as having plumbing/sanitation systems *later* or as examples of places where public baths existed (in the case of Rome), but Harappa is directly described as having advanced, integrated home plumbing."
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ዘንሸራትት ክጥወይ ዝገብርዎ ኣየኖት እዮም?,"The correct answer is **A: ንእሽተይ ምጥዋይ ኣብ ድሕሪት ናይቲ መንሸራተቲ በሊሕ ነገር**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how the thin ice breaks off in small pieces as the object (the 'blhi' or 'thing') moves across it. This shedding of small pieces (the 'n'shitey' or 'small bits') happens *behind* the moving object.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ክልተ ጫፋት ኣብቲ ናይቲ መንሸራተቲ በሊሕ ነገር ምህላዉ** - The two ends help with detecting the ice, but aren't what's *shedding* or breaking off.
*   **C: ናይቲ ዘንሸራትት ሓፈሻዊ ናይ ክእለት ደረጃኡ** - This refers to the ice's fragility, but isn't the direct action described.
*   **D: ብቕዓት ናይቲ በረድ** - The strength of the ice is a factor, but not what's actively falling off.

Therefore, option A accurately describes the observable phenomenon mentioned in the passage."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣብ ናይ ዘመናዊ መንሸራተቲ ናይ በረድ ዝርከብ በሊሕ ነገር ዘሎ ባዶ ብልክዕ ዝገልጹ ኣየኖት እዮም?,"The correct answer is **A: ክልተ-ጫፍ (Kilti-chaf)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly describes the object as having ""ኽልተ ጫፍ (kilti-chaf)"" - two edges/points. This is the defining characteristic used to distinguish it from other possibilities. The passage uses this feature to explain how it interacts with the ice and how its movement is observed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ጠዋይ (Taway)** -  This translates to ""dawn"" or ""morning"" and doesn't relate to a physical object.
*   **C: ለጥላጥ (Letilat)** - This translates to ""slippery"" and describes a quality, not a thing.
*   **D: ዝቐነነ (Ziqenene)** - This means ""thin"" or ""sharp"" and describes a characteristic, not the object itself.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ኣቶም ካብ ብርሃን ተረፍ ጽዓት ከዉጽእ ዘኽእሎ መስርሕ እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ዝተነቓቕሐ ምዉጻእ ፎቶናት** (Emitting photons when excited).

Here's why:

* **The passage explains that atoms emit tiny particles called ""photons"" when they are excited by light.** This is the process described as ""ዜነቓቕሕ ጸርጊ"" (induced emission). 
* The passage specifically says atoms *release* energy as photons when struck by light.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ጨረርታ (Radiation)** - While light *is* a form of radiation, the passage focuses on the *mechanism* of how atoms release energy *as* photons.
* **C: ፎቶን (Photon)** - A photon is *what* is emitted, not the process itself.
* **D: ዝተነቓቕሐ ምዉጻእ ናይ ጨረርታ (Emitting radiation when excited)** - Similar to option A, this is too broad. The passage is specific about *photons* being the emitted particles.



"
ሓደ ኣቶም ፎቶን ከዉጽእ ዝገብሮ እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ተረፍ ጽዓት ንምዉጻእ (To release excess energy)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that atoms emit photons (tiny particles of light) when they ""need to get rid of excess energy"" from being hit by light.  This energy is released as light.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ምንቕቓሕ ብድሙቕ ብርሃን ዝተፈጥረ (Being excited by dim light)** - While the passage mentions dim light *causing* the process, it's not what the atom *does* in response.
* **C: ዘይርጉእ ናይ ጽዓት ደረጃታት (Irregular energy levels)** -  The passage doesn't discuss irregular energy levels.
* **D: ጎናዊ ሳዕቤን ንጨረርታ (Side effects for radiation)** - This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ኣምፑል ናይ ልቺ ምስራሕ ተቓርጸሉ ምኽንያት እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **D: ዋሕዚ ናይ ኤሌትሪክ ናብቲ ሶኬት ምስ ዝዝሕል** (When electricity flows into the socket).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states the danger of electric shock when trying to replace the bulb because electricity can flow into the metal parts of the socket. This is the reason for the precaution of turning off the light or disconnecting the power.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: እቲ ብርሃን ዘመንጩ ብግቡእ ምስ ዘይጠፍእ** (The light source not turning off properly) - While turning off the light is *part* of the safety procedure, it's not the *reason* the bulb might be dangerous to remove.
* **B: እቲ ናይ ኣምፑል ሓጺናዊ ጫፍ ናብ ሶኬት ምሉእ ዘይምእታዉ** (The bulb's narrow end not fully entering the socket) - This is not mentioned in the text as a cause of danger.
* **C: ኣብ ዉሽጢ ኣምፑል ዝርከብ ስልኪ ምስ ዝቓጸል** (When something metallic inside the bulb touches) - The text doesn't mention anything about metal inside the bulb causing a hazard.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that touching the metal part of the socket while it's still connected to electricity (even if the bulb is burned out) can cause a dangerous electric shock. The tip of the bulb is the part you'd be touching while trying to unscrew it from the socket.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: እቲ ስልኪ (The phone):** A phone isn't related to the electrical hazard described.
*   **B: እቲ መወልዒ መጥፊኢ (The switch):** The passage mentions turning off the light *before* changing the bulb, making the switch a safety measure, not a hazard.
*   **D: እቲ ገመድ (The cord):** While a damaged cord could be dangerous, the passage specifically focuses on the risk of the socket being live.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ኣቶማት ዘይርጉእ ንዩክሊ፣ ማለት ምስ ንእሽቶ ወይ ምንም ምትንኻፍ ናብ ምስባር ይዝንብሉ።""  This directly translates to ""Some atoms are unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to decay with little or no prompting."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ፕሮቶንስ ይርከቡ** - The text mentions protons being *in* the nucleus, not that a nucleus *emits* protons when it decays.
*   **B: ጸዓት ይወጽእ** - The text doesn't explicitly mention energy being released when a nucleus decays.
*   **D: ኒትሮንስ ይጠፉኡ** - The text doesn't say anything about neutrons disappearing.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ናይ ነዊሕ ርሕቐት ጻዊዒት ናብ ዓለም ዘንጸባርቑ ኣየኖት እዮም,"The correct answer is **B: ሳተላይታት (Satellites)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that satellites are used to observe things from a distance (""ንዚርከብ ሰብ ክትድውለሉ ኸለኻ ብሳተላይት ኢኻ እትጥቀም ዘለኻ""). It also describes how they reflect signals and are launched into space by rockets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ቴሌስኮፓት (Telescopists):** While telescopes are *used* in space, the passage refers to the objects sent to space, not the people who use them.
* **C: ብርሃናት (Lights):** The passage mentions light being blocked by the atmosphere, but it's not what's being sent from a distance.
* **D: ሮኬታት (Rockets):** Rockets are used to *launch* satellites, they aren’t the objects that stay in space and observe.



"
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ቴሌስኮፕ ኣብ ጠፈር ንኸተቐምጥ ዝሕግዙ ኣየኖት እዮም?,"The correct answer is **B: ሮኬታት (Rockets)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ሳተላይት ብሮኬት ናብ ህዋ ተላእከት"" which translates to ""Satellites are launched into space by rockets.""  It also says telescopes need a rocket to reach above 100 meters.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ናይ ብርሃን ብዙሓት ጩራታት (Many light sources)** - While light is *observed* by telescopes, it doesn't *launch* them into space.
* **C: ናይ መሬት ሃዋሁ (Earth's atmosphere)** - The atmosphere is why telescopes are *put* in space, to avoid its interference, not what helps get them there.
* **D: ልዕሊ 100 ፊት ንዉሓት ዘለዎም ሳተላይታት (Satellites over 100 feet high)** - This describes satellites, but doesn't explain how they *get* into space.



"
ምሕላፍ ግዜ ንምምዝጋብ ኣየናይ ናይ ዑደት ፍጻሜ እዩ ኣብ ትሕቲ ግዛቤ ክመጽእ ዘለዎ?,"The correct answer is **B: ምድግጋም (Repetition)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ብዑደት ዝፍፀሙ ዘለው ኩነታት በቢ ግዚኡ ተደጋጊሞም ዝፍጠሩ እዮም።"" This translates to ""Some events happen repeatedly over time."" This directly relates to the idea of *repetition* or cycles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ንውሓት ግዜ (Change of Time):** While the passage mentions time as a framework for change, it doesn't focus on the change itself as an answer to the question.
*   **C: ጽልዋ (Shadow):** This is not related to the discussion of time and recurring events.
*   **D: ጸገም (Pain/Difficulty):** The passage does mention time being a source of anxiety, but the core idea it highlights about experiencing time is repetition.



"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ግዜ ንምንጽጻር ዝገልግል ኣየናይ መዳይ ናይ ሓደ ፍጻሜ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ንውሓት (Change)**.

Here's why:

The text states ""ጊዜ እውን ናይ ኩነታት ንውሓት ግዜ ነነፃፅረሉ እዩ"" which translates to ""Time is also the time we measure the change of states.""  This directly connects time to the concept of change.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ምድግጋም (Repetition):** While the text mentions events repeating, it doesn't define time *as* repetition.
*   **C: ተመኩሮ (Experience):** Time allows for experiences, but isn't the definition of time itself according to the text.
*   **D: ጽልዋ (Brightness/Clarity):** This is not related to the definition of time in the provided text.

Here's why:

The passage states that Charles received a 2:2 degree in history. It also highlights that he was the first member of the royal family to earn a university degree. The passage implies that this is an unusual accomplishment, specifically pointing out his degree classification (2:2). This suggests that having a degree, and even a specific degree classification like 2:2, is a characteristic of a potential heir.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ናብ ዉትህድርና ንምጽንባር ዩኒቪሲቲ ምዉጻእ** - The passage says the heir *should* go to university, but doesn't say it's a requirement for being a potential heir.
*   **C: ታሪኽ ምጽናዕ** - While Charles studied history, the passage doesn't suggest this is a specific requirement.
*   **D: ቅድሚ ናብ ዉትህድርና ምኻድ ናብ ዩኒቨርሲቲ** - The passage indicates university education should come *after* the heir apparent is identified, not before.

The passage explicitly states: ""ብባህሊ እቲ ነቲ ናይ ንግስና ወንበር ዝወርስ ቀጥታ ድሕሪ ትምህርቲ ናብ ወትህድርና ክኸይድ ኣለዎ"" which translates to ""According to tradition, the heir to the throne must attend university immediately after education.""  This means the first thing Charles did was go to university after his education.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ምጽናዕ ስነ-ጥንቲ (Studying History):** He studied history *at* university, but it wasn't the first thing he did.
* **C: ዲግሪ ምህላዉ (Receiving a degree):** He received a degree *after* attending university.
* **D: ናብ ስላሴ ኮሌጅ ምስታፍ (Attending Trinity College):** Attending Trinity College is part of going to university, not the first thing he did overall.

ጭፍራ ትርይግቫሻኦን ካበየናይ ሃገር እዩ?,"The correct answer is **D: ኖርወይ**.

The text states: ""ኦላፍ ትሪግቫሰን ዚበሃል ንሃገሩ ኻብ ግዝኣት ደንማርክ ኪመልሳ ዚምነ ዝነበረ ኖርወይያዊ እየን ዚምርሓ."" This translates to ""Olaf Tryggvason was a Norwegian who aimed to liberate his country from Danish rule.""

Therefore, Olaf Tryggvason is from Norway."
ኣበየናይ ግዜ ናይ ታሪኽ እዩ ጀርመን ኣብ እስቶንያ ሓያል ባህላዊ ጽልዋ ዘዉረደ?,"The passage states the German cultural influence in Northern Estonia was strong around the 15th century. 

* 15th century is roughly 500-600 years ago (2024 - 1500 = 524 years).

Therefore, the closest answer is **C: ከባቢ ቅድሚ 600 ዓመት**.



"
ቛንቛ ናይ ኢስቶንያ ብምንታይ ተጸልዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: እቲ Õ/õ መለለዩ ጠባይ** (The unique character Õ/õ).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the Estonian language adopted the character ""Õ/õ"" from German, which became a defining feature of the language.  While German influence is present in other ways (vocabulary), the passage highlights the *Õ/õ* as a key element of how the Estonian language developed *because* of German influence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: እቲ ናይ ጀርመን ቛላት** (The German words) - While the passage mentions adopted vocabulary, it doesn't say this is *how* the language was preserved, just that it happened.
* **C: ጀርመን ኣቕሽሽቲ** (German influence) - This is too broad. The passage specifies *how* the influence manifested, not just that it existed.
* **D: ኣምላኽ** (God) - The passage mentions missionaries wanting to bring religion, but this isn't the reason the language was influenced or preserved.

The passage states: ""ቍጽሪ እቶም ደቀባት ከከም እቲ ኣጸቢቑ ዚዛመድ ላህጃታት ዚጽብጸብ እንተ ዀይኑ ወይ እንተ ዘይኰይኑ ይፈላለ እዩ።"" This translates to ""The number of speakers varies depending on how strictly dialects are counted.""  This means the *number of people who *speak* the language* is what changes based on the criteria used (e.g., counting dialects as separate languages or not).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't say the number of related languages affects the count.
*   **B:** The passage states Hindi and Urdu are similar, but the number of Hindi speakers isn't tied to the number of Urdu speakers.
*   **C:**  While 800 million can *understand* the language, the passage is specifically discussing the number of *speakers* (those who can *speak* it), and that number fluctuates.

*   **A: ዝበዝሐ ግዜ ኣብ መንጎ ተዛረብቲ ናይ ክልቲኡ ቛንቛታት ዘይምስምማዕ ኣሎ** - The passage states they *can* understand each other, not that they *don't* understand each other.

* **Option B** incorrectly states the name as ""ሁናን ጀኖጉም"" which is *not* what the passage says.  Hunminjeongeum is the correct name.

Let's look at why the other options are correct and therefore *not* the answer:

* **A: ኣብ መጀመርታ ዘመን ናይ ንጉስ ሳጆንግ ተረኽበ** - The passage states the alphabet was created during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450).
* **C: በቲ ራብዓይ ንጉስ ብንግስነት ጆሶን ተፈጥረ** - The passage states King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty.
* **D: ብዕላማ ተፈጥረ** - The passage clearly states the alphabet was purposefully created (""ኣብ መዓልታዊ ንጥፈታት ሃንጉል ጥራይ እዩ ብዕላማ እተማህዘ"").



"
ኣብ መወዳእታ እቲ ፊደል ናይ ሁንሚን ጀኖጉም ናበይ ተቐየረ?,"The correct answer is **B: ሃንጉል**.

The text states that the alphabet was originally named *Hunmin Jeongeum*, but is now known as *Hangul*. The question asks what it was renamed to.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ቛንቋታት ላቲን** - The text compares Sanskrit *to* Latin, but doesn't say Sanskrit influenced Latin.
*   **B: ቛንቋታት ኤሮፓ** - While Sanskrit is similar to Latin (a European language), the text specifically states it's the origin of *Indian* languages.
*   **C: ቛንቋታት ናይ ጥንቲ** - While Sanskrit *is* an ancient language, the question asks about the languages *derived* from it."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ጥቕሚ ናይ ሳንስክሪት ብሰንኪ እንታይ ጎዲሉ?,"The correct answer is **B: ስደት ናይ ኣርያን**.

The text states: ""ሓደ ኻብዚ ብዛዕባ እቶም ቋንቋኦም ሒዞም ካብ ምዕራብ ናብ ህንዲ ዝገዓዙ ኣርያን ዚገልጽ እዩ."" (One of these concerns the Aryans who migrated from the west to India with their languages.)  This directly connects the importance of Sanskrit to the arrival of the Aryans and their language.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ምስቕልቕል** - This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **C: ቛንቛታት ላቲን** - While the text *compares* Sanskrit to Latin, it doesn't say Sanskrit's importance *stemmed from* Latin languages.
*   **D: ደረጃ** -  The text touches on Sanskrit losing prominence, not gaining it, due to political reasons.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:**  A person who weighs 90 pounds on Earth would only weigh 16 kilograms (approximately 35 pounds) on Io. This clearly indicates Io's gravity is *less* than Earth's.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  The passage doesn't say Io's gravity *pulls* less, it says you *weigh* less.
* **C:** This is the opposite of what the passage says.  Lower gravity means *lower* weight.
* **D:** Again, the passage indicates Io's gravity is weaker, not stronger.

Here's why:

* The text states ""ኣብ ትሕቲ ማሪያ ቀጢን ከምኡውን ኣብ በሪክቦታ ረጒድ እዩ"" which translates to ""Under Maria it is shallow and also rugged in Berikota"".  This indicates the presence of underwater features (like craters or valleys) beneath the surface.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: እቲ ዝቐረበ ሸነኽ ዝረጎደ መሸፈኒ ኣለዎ** (The nearby crater has a rugged surface) - While the text mentions ruggedness, it doesn't specifically link it to the nearby crater.
* **B: እቲ መሸፈኒ ኣብ ትሕቲ እቲ ላዕለዋይ መሬት ዝቐጠነ እዩ** (The surface is faster under the upper ground) - The text states the *lava* flow is faster, not the surface itself.
* **C: ናብቲ ዝረሓቐ ወገን ዉሑድ ኮኾብ ናይ ባሕሪ ክህልዉ ይኽእል እዩ** (There may be few underwater craters on the distant side) - The text doesn't mention craters specifically, only the ruggedness of the area.

The text states: ""እቲ ክረስት ዝቐጠነ ብምዃኑ ኣብቲ ዝቐረበ ቦታ ዝበዝሐ ማሪያ ክህሉ ይኽእል።"" which translates to ""Because the crater is steep, there is a possibility of more maria in the closer area."" This directly indicates that the maria (volcanic plains) are concentrated in the closer, or less distant, part of the crater.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ዝበዝሐ ኮኾብ ናይ ባሕሪ ዝርከበሉ** (where the stars of the sea are abundant): This is unrelated to the text.
*   **C: ኣብ ትሕቲ እቲ ላዕለዋይ መሬት** (below the upper ground): The text mentions regions *under* Maria and Berickbota but doesn't directly say the *covering* itself extends there.
*   **D: ኣብ ትሕቲ ኮኾብ ናይ ባሕሪ** (below the stars of the sea):  This is also unrelated to the text.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states people contemplate whether humans are being thought about by beings on other worlds, and believe in ""aliens"" or other creatures. This directly implies a belief in the possibility of life existing on other planets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ደቒ ሰባት ናብ ካልኦት ኮዋኽብቲ ተጓዒዞም እዮም (Humans are traveling to other stars):** The passage talks about *contemplating* people traveling, not stating it as a fact.
* **B: ደቒ ሰባት ካልኦት ዓለማት ናይ ምፍታሽ ዓቕሚ ኣለዎም (Humans have the ability to explore other worlds):**  Similar to A, this is a possibility being considered, not a confirmed ability.
* **D: ኣብ መንጎ ከዋኽብቲ ትሕቲ ትሪልዮን ማይላት ርሕቐት ኣሎ (There is a distance of less than a trillion miles between stars):** The passage states the distance is *trillions* of miles, not less. It's a statement of fact about distance, not a belief.

ካብ ጸሓይ እንዳርሓቓ ኣብ እትኸደሉ እንዳ ቐጠነ ዝኸይድ ነገር እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ጋዝ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ካብ ማእከል ጸሓይ እናረሓቕካ ብዝኸድካ መጠን እቲ ጋዝ እናቐሃመ ኢዩ ዝኸይድ."" (As you move away from the center of the sun, the gas gets cooler.)

This directly answers the question of what gets cooler as you move away from the sun. While plasma and the sun are made of hot gas, the passage specifically states it's the *gas* that cools.

The passage states: ""እቲ ንጸሓይ ክንርእያ ኸለና እንርእዮ ደጋዊ ኽፋል ፎቶስፌር ተባሂሉ ይጽዋዕ፣ ትርጕማ ኸኣ """"ኵዕሶ ብርሃን"""" ማለት እዩ።"" (The part of the sun we see is called the photosphere, which means ""sphere of light""). This directly states that the photosphere *is* the part we see from Earth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: እቲ ሽፋን (The cover/shell):** The text doesn't mention a ""cover"" or shell as a visible part.
*   **B: እቲ ፕላዝማ (The plasma):** While the sun *is* made of plasma, we don't directly see the plasma itself.
*   **D: እቲ ማእከል (The core):** The core is inside the sun and obviously not visible from Earth.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that observing Venus going through phases (like the Moon) *supported* Copernicus's idea that planets orbit the Sun. This is because if Venus orbits the Sun, we would expect to see it illuminated from different angles as it moves around the Sun, resulting in phases. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ምስግጋር ናይ ቬኑስ** (Transit of Venus) - While the transit of Venus was observed, the passage focuses on the *phases* as the key evidence for Copernicus's theory.
* **C: ናይ ጸሓይ ተመሳሰልነት ምስ ቬኑስ** (Similarity of the Sun and Venus) -  The passage doesn't discuss any similarities between the Sun and Venus.
* **D: ናይ ጸሓይ ተመሳሰልነት ምስ ወርሒ** (Similarity of the Sun and the Moon) - The passage uses the Moon as an *analogy* to explain the phases of Venus, but doesn't state a similarity between the Sun and Moon.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Galileo Galilei used a telescope in 1610 ""to observe that Venus has phases like the moon.""  The phases of Venus were the specific observations he made.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ክፋል ናይ ወርሒ ናብ ጸሓይ ዝጥምት (Parts of the moon facing the sun):** While Galileo *compared* Venus's phases to the moon, he wasn't observing the moon itself in 1610 for this particular discovery.
* **C: ፕላኔት ኣብ ዙርያ ጸሓይ እንዳዞረት (Planets orbiting the sun):** This is the *implication* of his observations, supporting Copernicus's theory, but not what he directly observed.
* **D: ምስግጋር ናይ ቬኑስ (Transit of Venus):** The passage mentions a transit of Venus observed by Horrocks in 1639, not Galileo in 1610.

The passage states ""ናይ አማዞን ፈለግ ካልኣይ እቲ ዝነዉሐ ከምኡውን ኣብልዕሊ ምድሪ ዝዓበየ ፈለግ እዩ"" which translates to ""The Amazon River is the second longest but the largest river on Earth.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: እቲ ካልኣይ ዝነዉሐ ፈለግ እዩ (It is the second longest river):** While true, the passage emphasizes it's *also* the largest.
*   **C: እቲ ዝነዉሐ ፈለግ እዩ (It is the longest river):** This is incorrect; the passage specifically says it's the *second* longest.
*   **D: እቲ ዝሰፍሐ ፈለግ እዩ (It is the river that flows the most):** The passage does mention its flow rate, but identifying it as the ""largest"" is the main point.

Here's why:

The text states that ""a fifth of Venezuelans work in agriculture."" This is the largest single sector employing Venezuelans mentioned in the text, making it the most accurate answer to the question of the largest employment sector.  While oil is important to Venezuela, only a tenth of Venezuelans work directly in the oil industry. Service and Industry sectors are also mentioned but represent a smaller proportion compared to agriculture."

Here's why:

The text states that ""two thirds of Venezuelans work in the services sector."" This is a larger proportion than those in agriculture (one fifth), industry (one tenth), or oil (one tenth). 

Therefore, more Venezuelans are employed in the services sector than in any other mentioned field.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ብዝፍጠር ጸዓት ብርሃንን ሙቐት ይህቡ"" which translates to ""...they emit light and heat."" This directly answers the question of what fusion allows stars to do.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ከበድቲ ባእታታት ይፈጥሩ** - While fusion *does* create heavier elements, the text doesn't highlight this as the primary thing fusion allows stars to do.
*   **B: ምዉህሃድ ናይ ተቓመምቲ ይሃንጽ** - The text doesn't mention anything about stopping conflicts.
*   **D: ሃይድሮጅን ኣቶማታት ይፈጥር** - Fusion *uses* hydrogen atoms, but it doesn't create them.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""ከዋኽብቲ ናይ ሃይድሮጅን ኣተማት ዝኸበደ ባእታ ንምፍጣር..."" which translates to ""Stars form by fusing hydrogen atoms...""  The passage is talking about the source of energy in stars, which is the fusion of hydrogen atoms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ከዋኽብቲ (Stars):** Stars *use* hydrogen, they don't *create* the fusion reaction itself.
* **C: ኣቶማት (Atoms):** While hydrogen fusion involves atoms, the question asks about the *source* of the valuable fusion.
* **D: ጽዓት (Energy):** Energy is the *result* of the fusion, not the source material.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ማይ ብክልተ ሃይዶርጀን ኣቶምን ሓደ ኦክሲጀን ኣቶምን ዝተሰርሐ እዩ."" which translates to ""Water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.""

Therefore, option D accurately reflects the chemical composition of water as described in the text."

Here's why:

The passage states that regardless of whether water is a gas, liquid, or solid, it *always* has the same type of molecule (H₂O).  It's the *physical state* that changes, not the fundamental building block.  ""ሞለኩላዊ ቕርጺ"" directly refers to the molecular structure - the arrangement of atoms within the molecule.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ጻዕቒ (Solid)**: Water isn't always solid. It can be liquid or gas.
* **C: ኣካላዊ ኩነታት (Physical state)**: The passage specifically says the physical state *changes*.
* **D: ፈሳሲ ናይትሮጅን (Liquid nitrogen)**: The passage uses liquid nitrogen as an example of something with a consistent molecular structure across states, but isn’t what remains constant *with water*.

This means the central government couldn't overrule the states.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ ዉሽጢ ጉባኤ ሓይሊ ዘይምህላዉ (Not having the power within the assembly/Congress):** While the text mentions issues with Congress, the primary weakness wasn't a lack of *internal* power, but a lack of power *over the states*.
* **C: ምምሕያሻት ምሉእ ፍቓድ ስምምዕ ዝሓትት (Requiring unanimous consent for agreements):**  The text *does* mention the need for unanimous consent (""ኵለን መንግስትታት ኪእረማ ቕድሚ ምኽኣለን ብሓደ ድምጺ ፍቓድ ኪወጻ የድልየን ነበረ""), but this is a *result* of the weakness, not the core problem itself. The fundamental issue is the inability to enforce decisions.
* **D: ሓደ ዘይህሉዉ ሃገራዊ ዉሳኔ (Not having a single national decision):** This is a consequence of the central government's weakness but not the central problem. The lack of national decisions stems from the inability to enforce any decision.

* **A: ቀረጻት ብጉባኤ ከምኡዉን ብናይ ግዝኣት ሰበ-ስልጣናት ይፍጸሙ ነበሩ** (Decisions were made by the congress and government officials) - While Congress existed, the passage emphasizes its *lack* of power and the disorganization of officials.

* **D: ማእከላዊ መንግስቲ ክልተ ዓበይቲ ክፋላት ዝሓዘ ነበረ** (The central government was divided into two major branches) - The passage doesn't mention any divisions within the central government; it highlights its overall weakness and lack of structure.

Here's why:

The passage states that the pyramids of Giza are distinguished by their ""extraordinary skill and technical prowess"" and that later Egyptian kingdoms were ""surpassed"" by the skill of their ancestors who built them. This implies the complexity of the Giza pyramids was something later kingdoms *couldn't replicate*.  The passage directly points to the fact that the later Egyptians couldn’t match the skills used to build them, meaning they were too complex for them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

The passage states: ""ጀርመን ነቲ መጥቃዕቲ """"ኦፐሬሽን ሲ ሊዮን"""" ኢላ ሰመየቶ"" (Germany named the attack ""Operation Sea Lion""). 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ዳንክሪክ (Dunkirk)** - Dunkirk is a location where British forces retreated from, not the name of the planned invasion.
*   **C: ኽሪግስማሪን (Kriegsmarine)** - This is the German navy.
*   **D: ሓይሊ ባሕሪ ሮያል (Royal Navy)** - This is the British navy.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Italy's goal was to attack British bases and infrastructure in Egypt. This was done to control the Mediterranean Sea and ultimately invade Africa.  ""Ab ghibtsi zinebera meser'tatn merakhbn briTanya khieawgdo neb'ero"" directly translates to ""It was meant to attack British bases and ships in Egypt"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ተወሰኽቲ መርከባት ምህናጽ (Providing limited ships)** - The passage mentions Italy had a weaker navy, not that they were providing ships.
* **C: ተወርዋሪ ጉጅለ ምምስራት (Leading invading groups)** - While invasion was the ultimate goal, the passage focuses on the initial objective of attacking Egypt.
* **D: ናይ ብሪጣንያ ድፋዓት ምዕናዉ (Defeating British power)** - Defeating British power was a broader objective, not the immediate task.  Attacking Egypt was a *step* towards that goal.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Italy's main targets were African countries (""ቀንዲ ሸቶታት ኢጣልያ ሃገራት ኣፍሪቃ እየን ነይረን"").  It further explains that they planned to control the Mediterranean Sea to invade Africa (""ንኣፍሪቃ ምእንቲ ኽወርርወን""). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ድልዱል ሰራዊት ከምኡዉን ሓይሊ ባሕሪ ምህናጽ** - While the text mentions Italy had a weak army and navy, this was a *problem* for them, not their main goal.
* **C: ናይ ግብጺ መርከባት ምጥፋእ** - Attacking Egypt was a *means* to an end (controlling the Suez Canal and Africa), not the ultimate goal itself.
* **D: ናይ ብሪጣንያ ድፋዕ ምምስራት** - The text doesn't suggest Italy's primary aim was to defeat Britain, only to attack British bases in Egypt.

ምስ ገዛእቲ ምሕዝነታዊ ርክባት ዝመስረተ መን ነበረ?,"The correct answer is **B: ቪኪ ፈረንሳዉያን**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the southern part of France was under the control of the ""Vichy"" French, who collaborated with the Germans after signing a peace treaty in 1940. This indicates a collaborative, and therefore a subservient, relationship with the German forces.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: እቶም ጀርመናዉያን** - While the Germans were the occupiers, the passage describes the *Vichy French* as the governing body *under* German control.
*   **C: ኣሜሪካዉያን** - The Americans *liberated* Southern France, they didn't collaborate with the occupiers.
*   **D: ነጻ ፈረንሳዉያን** - The passage mentions them as a goal to reach (liberating France), but they weren't the ones collaborating with the Germans.

Here's why:

* The passage states that American troops liberated southern France, driving the Germans back.
* It also mentions the goal was to liberate France, implying collaboration with those fighting *against* the Vichy French and Germans – which would be the Free French forces.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ቪኪ ፈረንሳውያን ከምኡዉን ኣሜሪካዉያን** (Vichy French and Americans) - The Americans were fighting *against* the Vichy French.
* **C: ጀርመናዉያን ከምኡዉን ፈረንሳዉያን** (Germans and French) - The French involved were the Free French, not those collaborating with the Germans.
* **D: ኣሜሪካዉያን ከምኡዉን ጀርመናዉያን** (Americans and Germans) - The Americans were fighting *against* the Germans.

Here's why:

The passage explains that submarines submerge to avoid detection, implying they control their depth. This control is achieved by adjusting **buoyancy** - making themselves heavier or lighter than water to sink or rise.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ዩ-ጃልባታት (U-boats)**: This is a *type* of submarine, not the technology that allows them to submerge.
*   **B: ናይ ምቱካስ ርሕቐት (Range of Communication)**:  Communication range is important, but doesn't explain how a submarine goes underwater.
*   **D: ራዳር (Radar)**: Radar is used to *detect* submarines, not to allow them to submerge.  The text even mentions submarines diving to *avoid* radar.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""ጀርመናውያን ሳብማሪኖም ኣብ **ምጕዓዝን** ኣብ ምዕያይን ንፉዓት እዮም ነይሮም"" which translates to ""The Germans in submarines were skilled in **attacking/raiding** and sinking.""

The passage focuses on the submarine's role as a weapon for attacking ships, making ""ምጉዓዝ"" the most relevant answer to the question about its important role during wartime.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ምንስፋፍ (expanding/spreading):**  While submarines can cover large areas, the text emphasizes their offensive capabilities, not just their ability to spread out.
*   **C: ምቱካስ (fighting/battling):** The text describes submarines *conducting* attacks, not necessarily engaging in direct, face-to-face battles.
*   **D: ዕዬአን (searching):** Although submarines can search, this isn't their primary function described in the passage.  The passage highlights their destructive power.

Here's why:

The text states that the Red Army (from the Soviet Union) entered Poland with over 800,000 troops, breaking existing treaties and ultimately partitioning Poland with Belarus and Ukraine. This clearly indicates that the Soviet Union was the driving force behind the events described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ፖሊሻዉያን:** The text describes Poland *being* invaded and partitioned, not initiating the agreements.
*   **B: ሮማንያውያን:** Romania is mentioned as a bridge, but not as a party to the agreements or invasion.
*   **C: ዩክረናዉያን:** Ukraine is mentioned as part of the partition of Poland (along with Belarus), but not as the initiator of the agreements."

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that after invading Poland, the Soviet Union formed fronts in Belarus and Ukraine, effectively dismantling the eastern parts of Poland. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ግምባር ዩክረናዉያን ምፍጣር (Creating Ukrainian fronts)** - While fronts *were* created in Ukraine, the question asks what wasn't already happening. Creating fronts is a result of the invasion, not a pre-existing condition.
*   **C: ዳግመ ምደባ ኣብ ንመጥቓዕቲ ዝተቖጻጸርዎ ቦታ (Redeployment to previously agreed locations)** - The text describes an *invasion*, not a redeployment.
*   **D: ምጥሓስ ስምምዕ (Breaking agreements)** - Breaking agreements is implied by the invasion, but the text highlights the *result* of the invasion – the dismantling of Poland's eastern territories.

This means breath control is a key component of Kundalini Yoga, which is central to Tibetan Buddhism according to the text.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: ምድግጋም ማንቱራታት (Reciting mantras):** While mantras are *part* of the practice, the text emphasizes breathwork as the primary way the Kundalini energy is activated.
*   **C: ምስኣል ጣኦታት (Worshiping idols):** The text doesn’t focus on idol worship as a central element of Tibetan Buddhist practice.
*   **D: ናይ ዮጋ ኣቓዉማ ምምላኽ (Practicing yoga postures):** While yoga is mentioned, the text specifically highlights Kundalini Yoga and its focus on breath and energy work, not just general postures."

This clearly points to practices (specifically yoga practices) being the mechanism for the transformation during the central part of Tibetan prayer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ብምስኣል ጣኦታት (By worshipping idols)** - While deities are *involved* in the visualization, the core of the process isn't simply worship, but the effect of the practice itself.
*   **C: በቲ ምድግጋም ናይ ቓላት (By chanting words)** - Mantras (chanting) are *part* of the yoga practices, but aren’t the full explanation of how things change.
*   **D: ናይ ምስትንፋስ ንጥፈታ ምልምማድ (Practicing breathing techniques)** - Breathing techniques are also *part* of Kundalini yoga which is *related* to the central practice, but not the complete explanation.

This statement is made by someone familiar with the operation of the roller coaster – specifically, how long it takes to dismantle and rebuild it. This points to the roller coaster operator being the source of this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ናይ ሓዊ ካፒተን (The ship captain):** The text mentions a ship captain, but this information refers to a hot day in Santa Clara, not the roller coaster.

The passage states that many residents of Bishkek blame those who came from the south for inciting lawlessness and that police patrol the streets. This strongly implies that residents believe the *police/law enforcement* are the ones who should be held responsible for the disorder.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ወነንቲ ዱካን** (Shop owners) - While shop owners are victims of the looting, they aren't being blamed for *causing* the lawlessness.
* **C: ተቓወምቲ** (Protesters) - The passage mentions those from the south being seen as instigators, but it doesn't directly state residents blame protesters in general.
* **D: ኮተቴታት** (Courts) - Courts are part of the legal system, but not typically the first point of blame for street-level disorder."
ካብ ደቡብ ነቲ ምዝራፍ ነቶም ተቓወምቲ መን ወቒሶሞም?,"The correct answer is **A: ተቓማጦ ናይ ቢሽከክ (Bishkek protesters)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ብዙሕ ነባሮ ቢሽከክ ነቶም ካብ ደቡብ ዝመጽኡ ሰልፈኛታት ንሕጊ ኣልቦነት ተሓተትቲ ይገበሩዎ።""  This translates to ""Many residents of Bishkek accosted the protesters coming from the south, accusing them of lawlessness.""

This clearly indicates that the Bishkek protesters are the ones confronting/stopping the southerners.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ሰበ-ስልጣናት ኣተግበርቲ ሕጊ (Law enforcement authorities):** While the police are mentioned patrolling, the text doesn't say *they* stopped the southerners.
* **C: ተቓወምቲ ናይ ሰበ-ስልጣናት (Protesters of authorities):**  This doesn't match the described action.
* **D: ጉጅለ ናይ ሰባት (Group of people):** Too vague; the text specifically identifies them as Bishkek residents/protesters.
"
ሪንግ ልዑል መሸጣ መዓስ ኣጋጢሙ?,"The correct answer is **C: ኣብ QVC ድሕሪ ምምጹኡ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ሲሚኖፍ ኣብ 2017, ኣብ ናይ ዕድጊ ቴሌቭዥን ቻናል QVC ተራእዩ.""  and then mentions he opened up negotiations with ADT *after* this appearance. This implies the QVC appearance led to increased sales potential and ultimately the ADT deal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ድሕሪ ኣብ ሻርክ ታንክ ምምጹኡ:** The passage says he *pitched* on Shark Tank, but doesn't state it led to a significant sale.
* **B: ኣብ 2013 ገንዘብ ድሕሪ ምሓዙ:** The text only says he pitched on Shark Tank in 2013.
* **D: ምስ ADT ዝነበረ ሞጎተ ድሕሪ ምዝዛሙ:** The ADT deal happened *because* of the increased visibility from QVC, not the other way around.

ጄሚ ሰሚኒኦፍ ሪንግ ንኽጅምር መዓስ ወሲኑ?,"The correct answer is **A: ናይ ገዙኡ ካምፓኔላ እኹል ዘይምዃኑ ድሕሪ ምርድኡ** (After realizing he wasn't a good camper).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ቅድም ኢሉ፣ ናይ ሪንግ ዋና ኣካያዲ ስራሕ ጀሚ ሲሚኖፍ፣ መንቀሊ ሓሳብ ናይ'ቲ ኩባንያ ናቱ ናይ ማዕጾ ደወል ካብ ኣብ ጋራጁ ዘሎ ድንኳኑ ይስማዕ ስለዘይነበረ ምዃኑ ኣተንቢሁ።""  This translates to: ""Initially, Ring's main founder, Jamie Siminoff, revealed the company's idea came to him because he didn't like hearing the doorbell from his garage's tent.""

This means the initial impetus for starting Ring came from his dislike of the experience of *not* being able to hear the doorbell while camping (or in his garage tent, simulating camping). The other options are events that happened *after* the idea was already formed and the company was underway.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ከባቢ ቤት-ንባብ:** While the program encourages library use, it doesn't *define* the purpose of Reading Rainbow itself.
* **C: ቴማታት:** Themes are *within* the books, not the purpose of the program.
* **D: መጽሓፍቲ:** Books are *used* by the program, but they aren't the defining element of what Reading Rainbow offers.

ምስራዝ ናይ ተኸታተሊ ናይ ንባብ ሬንቦዉ እንታይ ኣምጺኡ?,"The correct answer is **C: ሓሳባት ናይ ጆን ግራንት**.

Here's why:

The passage states that John Grant from WNED Buffalo (Reading Rainbow station) used the show to teach children *how* to read, and that the show ""filled kids with books and encouraged them to read."" The ""Buffalo Reading Rainbow"" is directly linked to John Grant's ideas and efforts to promote reading.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ዘይእኹል ገንዘብ (Unspecified money)** - The passage doesn't mention funding.
*   **B: ዋሕዲ ሽልማት ኤሚ (One Emmy Award)** - The passage states the show won *dozens* of Emmys.
*   **D: ዓወት ናይ ኣቶ ሮጀርስ ጎረቤት (Success of Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood)** - While the passage mentions the show being inspired by Mr. Rogers, it doesn't say the reading rainbow’s success comes from *his* success.

Here's why:

The original text states that despite concerns about potential fungal contamination and public health risks, the Amsterdam authorities and the Anne Frank House considered demolition *after* a court ruling. However, the court ultimately *reversed* its decision.  This implies the demolition was not deemed necessary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ክዕቐቡ ኣለዎም (They must demolish)** - The text explicitly states the demolition was stopped.
* **C: ብፋንጋሳት ዝተበከለ እዩ (It is contaminated by fungi)** - While fungal contamination was a *concern*, the text doesn't state it was definitively confirmed as a reason for demolition.
* **D: ንህዝባዊ ጥዕና ሓደጋ እዩ (It is a danger to public health)** - Similar to C, this was a potential risk mentioned, but not the ultimate outcome.  The court decision reversal suggests the risk wasn't considered substantial enough for demolition.

The passage states that the RSPCA is proposing to fit CCTV cameras in all Australian slaughterhouses. The inspector believes this will send a message that the safety of those working with animals is a high priority, implying the cameras are the key to the increased monitoring and potential for investigations."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ናይ ኣዉስትራላዉያን ሰራሕተኛታት ናይ ማቸላዮ ናይ እንስሳ ድሕነት ኣገዳስነት ከጽንዕ ዝኽእል እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ምትእትታዉ ናይ ሲሲቲቭ ካሜራታት (Installation of CCTV cameras)**.

**Reasoning:**

The text directly states that the RSPCA is pushing for CCTV cameras to be installed in all Australian slaughterhouses. This is presented as a way to improve animal welfare and ensure the safety of those working with animals. The RSPCA’s Chief Inspector believes the cameras send a strong message that animal welfare is a top priority. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ግዳዊ ኣኼባ ምስ RSPCA (Mandatory meetings with RSPCA):**  The text doesn’t mention mandatory meetings.
* **C: ቐጻሊ ናይ ምክትታል ማቻልዮ (Continuing to refine slaughter methods):** While improving slaughter methods is a positive thing, the text focuses specifically on CCTV.
* **D: ካብቲ ABC ዘይምስትብሃል (Not being reported by ABC):** The text mentions BBC, not ABC, and whether or not something is reported is irrelevant to the welfare improvements.

The other options are incorrect as the text identifies the other individuals as:

*   **B:** Not a journalist, but someone who spoke to the Minneapolis Star Tribune.
*   **C:** Louis Jordan is described as the father of Red Lake Tribal Floyd Jordan, not a burial father himself.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""In the past month, large protests took place in Poland after the country ratified ACTA, prompting the government to reconsider the agreement."" This directly answers the question, indicating Poland is the country that ratified ACTA and faced protests as a result.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ጀርመን** - While Germany had protests, the passage doesn't say they ratified ACTA.
* **C: ስኮትላንድ** - Scotland had protests, but they weren't specifically linked to ratifying ACTA.
* **D: ሉተንያ** - Lithuania had protests, but the passage states Latvia, Slovakia and Lithuania are delaying joining ACTA, not that they've ratified it.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Latvia, Slovakia and Lithuania have expressed concerns about joining ACTA."" This indicates they are hesitating or refusing to ratify ACTA.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Estonia:** The text mentions Tallinn, Estonia, as a location where peaceful protests took place *in support of opposition to ACTA*, but doesn't say Estonia itself is refusing to join.
*   **B: Lithuania:** The text states Lithuania is expressing concerns, not outright refusal.
*   **C: Scotland:**  Scotland had protests, but the text doesn't state the Scottish government is opposing ACTA ratification.

The passage states Steve Jobs said ""ሎማዓንቲ ኣፕል ነቲ ስልኪ ዳግም ኣሕዲሱ ከፍርዮ እዮ ሎማዓንቲ ታሪክ ክንሰርሕ ኢና"" which translates to ""Apple lovers are going to redefine the phone and we are going to write a new history."" He clearly stated they would be writing a **new history** with the iPhone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: እቲ ተሌፎን (The phone):** While he *is* introducing a new phone, the quote focuses on changing the story *around* phones, not just the phone itself.
* **C: እቲ ትካል (The company):** The quote doesn't directly mention redefining Apple the company.
* **D: ተክሎኖሎጂ (Technology):** While the iPhone is a technological advancement, the emphasis is on the historical impact, not just the technology itself."

The text clearly states Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone, a phone, during his two-hour presentation. He was introducing and describing a new phone.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሓድሽ ታብለት ንምዉጻእ** (To unveil a new tablet) - The text specifically mentions an iPhone, not a tablet.
*   **B: ሓድሽ ኮምፒተር ንምዉጻእ** (To unveil a new computer) - The text focuses on a phone.
*   **D: ጥሮታኡ ንምእዋጅ** (To show off his ego) - While Steve Jobs was known for his presentations, the primary goal stated is to introduce a new product."

Here's why:

The passage states that Cristina Fernández de Kirchner ""announced she would run for president."" This directly relates to her presidential candidacy. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ንሰኔት ንምዉድዳር ዝነበራ ዕላማ (Her goal to be elected to the Senate):** While she *started* her national political career in the Senate, the passage focuses on her *current* intention to run for president.
* **C: ወፈራኣ ወኪል ምምሕዳር ቡኖስ ኣሪስ (Being a representative of the Buenos Aires administration):** The passage mentions she was a legislator in Buenos Aires, but this isn't the main point.
* **D: ካብ እዋናዊት ሰነተር ንምዉራድ ዝነበራ መደብ (The plan to move from a senator):**  The passage doesn't say she's planning to *move* from being a senator, but rather that she is now running for a different office (president).

Here's why:

The passage states, ""ወይዘሮ ኪርቸር ኣብ ኣርጀንቲና ቤት ትያትር ንፕሬዝደንትነት ናይ ምውድዳር ድሌታ ዝፍለጠት እንትኾን..."" This translates to ""Ms. Kirchner announced her presidential aspirations in a theater in Argentina..."" and further states it's in La Plata.  While the distance is mentioned (50km from Buenos Aires), the primary location is a theater *in* La Plata.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ኣብ ላ ፕላታ ዘሎ ኣብ ቡኖስ ኣሪስ ትያትር** - This is contradictory; La Plata and Buenos Aires are separate cities.
*   **C: ኣብቲ ናይ ኣርጀንቲና ትያትር 31 ማይላት ካብ ቡኖስ ኣሪስ** -  The passage doesn't specify a particular ""Argentina theater"" or mention 31 kilometers.
*   **D: ኣብ ላ ፕላታ ኣብ ቡኖስ ኣሪስ** - Again, La Plata and Buenos Aires are different locations.



"

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...ትሕዝቶ ኢንተርነት ክበሓል ግን ብኣካል ኣብ ሰርቨር ክቅመጥ ኣለዎ."" (Even though the video was released on the internet, Big Brother didn't break the online content regulations because the video wasn't *stored* on their server.)  This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ሕግታት ናይ ምምያ ኣይተጣሕሱን (The copyright laws weren't broken)** - The passage doesn't focus on copyright, but on where the content was *stored*.
* **B: መርበብ ኣብ ዌብሳይት ናይ ቢግ ብራዘር ተዓቒቦም ተረኽቦ (The content was linked to and accessed on the Big Brother website)** - The passage says it *wasn't* stored on their website.
* **C: ሕግታት ናይ ምምያ ተጣሒሶም እዮም (The copyright laws were broken)** - Again, the passage isn't about copyright.

The passage explicitly states: ""ቁጽጽር ትሕዝቶ ኢንተርኔት ዝህብ እኮ እንተኮነ፣ ትሕዝቶ ኢንተርነት ክበሓል ግን ብኣካል ኣብ ሰርቨር ክቅመጥ ኣለዎ።""  This translates to: ""Even if it provides online access, the content must be physically stored on a server to be considered hosted.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብ ኢንተርነት ክወጽእ ኣለዎ (It must be accessible on the internet):** While accessibility is *a result* of being on a server, it's not the requirement for *being considered hosted*.
* **C: ኣብ ዌብሳይት ክጽዓን የብሉን (It must be able to appear on a website):** Similar to A, appearing on a website is a consequence of being hosted, not the definition of hosting itself.
* **D: በቲ ACMA ተቓባልነት ክረክብ ኣለዎ (It must comply with ACMA):** ACMA compliance is about legality, not the technical aspect of hosting.

The passage states that Peter Costello (the Treasurer) is *expected to challenge* John Howard for the leadership of the Liberal Party. This means John Howard is currently the leader."
ኣዉስትራልያ ንምንታይ እያ ክሳብ ሕጂ ትካል ኑክልየር ሓይሊ ዘይብላ?,"The passage doesn't directly state *why* Australia hasn't pursued nuclear power. However, Costello states ""there is nothing to stop us,"" implying that the barriers aren't economic, danger, or cost. He suggests the only thing holding them back is the need to ""go to the polls and buy it"" - meaning gain public support.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: ናይ ህዝቢ ደገፍ ብዘይምህላዋ** (Lack of public support)."
ኣየናይ ኣንሸራታቲ እዩ ብሓገዝ ዝዛዘመ?,"The correct answer is **A: ኣና ጆክመሰን**.

This directly translates to ""The Netherlands qualified, with Anna Jochumsen finishing ninth in the women's Super-G.""  This means the Netherlands had a competitor finish in the top 10 of the women's Super-G, making them the country with a top ten result in that category.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **ፊንላንድ:** The text says Katja Saarinen finished 10th, not within the top nine.
*   **ኣዉስትራልያ:** Mitchell Gorley competed in the men's Super-G, not the women's.
*   **ሜክሲኮ:** Aril Velasquez competed in the men's Super-G, and finished 15th.

* **A: ኣብቲ ፍጻሜ ተኣሰረ** - The text states Blake was sentenced to prison.

* **D: ጠራሙዝ ናብኡ ከም ዝተሰንደወ ከሰሰ** - The text says he used the hammer to defend himself from being attacked.

Therefore, the only statement Blake did *not* admit to is accepting responsibility for the initial assault."

Here's why:

The passage states Blake ""was fined for disrupting the proceedings"" and ""was sentenced to prison by the judge."" This indicates he was held accountable (found guilty) for his disruptive behavior in court.  ""Contempt of court"" is the term for such behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ንሱ ተኣሲሩ (He was arrested)** - While he may have been initially detained, the passage focuses on the *consequence* of his actions – the fine and prison sentence – not the initial arrest.
* **C: ብፓሎ መጥቓዕቲ ወረዶ (He received a police fine)** - He received a fine from the court, not a police fine.
* **D: ናብ ቤት-ማእሰርቲ ክኸይድ ተኽእሎ ከም ዘለዎ ተነግረ (He was told he could go to prison)** - He wasn't just *told* he could go to prison, he *was* sentenced to prison.

* The passage discusses the need for funds and collaboration to *mitigate* (reduce) global warming. Option D directly addresses this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ምብዛሕ ዝራእቲ (Increasing productivity):**  While important, the passage doesn't focus on agricultural productivity.
* **B: ምምጻእ ቴክኖሎጂ ናብ ዝምዕብላ ዘለዋ ሃገራት (Transferring technology to developing countries):** This is *part* of the solution, but not the overall goal of the UN's efforts.  The goal is the reduction of emissions.

The text explicitly states that developed countries should ""ፋል ቴክኖሎጂታት ምክፋል"" (share technology) and provides ""ገንዘብ"" (money) to help vulnerable nations cope with climate change.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ምህርታት (Training):** While capacity building is implied, it isn't directly mentioned as something the UN believes developed countries *should* provide.

*   **D: ብዱኹም ናይ ማይ ምሕደራ ዝተጸልዉ ሰባት (People displaced by water scarcity):** The text mentions helping vulnerable countries, which *includes* those affected by water scarcity, but the direct aid offered is not people themselves.

The text states Albert Muchanga said, ""ብዛዕባ ናይ መበቆልን ናይ ትራፊክ ኮንን [ሲ]ኢሲንስን ሕግታት ክሳብ ሐዚ ኣይተሰማማዕናን እቲ ዘለና ቐንዲ መሰረት ግን ብ1 ሓምለ 2020 ንግዲ ንምጅማር እኹል ኢዩ።""  This translates to: ""We haven't yet harmonized rules on origin and transit [and] customs, but our basic framework is quite resolute to launch by January 1, 2020.""

This directly refers to a *date* (January 1, 2020) that they aim to finalize things by, even though rules are still being worked out.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በኒን ናብ AfCTA ምስ ዝጽንበር** - The text mentions Benin attending, but doesn't state anything about an agreement with them.
*   **C: መሰረታዉያን ሕግታት** - While the text mentions a basic framework, it specifically says the *rules* (of origin, transit, customs) are *not* yet harmonized.
*   **D: ፍቓድ ግብሪ** - This isn't discussed in the passage.

Here's why:

The text states ""ብ1 ሓምለ 2020 ንግዲ ንምጅማር እኹል ኢዩ"" which translates to ""We expect to start implementation by July 1, 2020"". The context is Nigeria's preparations for the AfCFTA (African Continental Free Trade Area).  Therefore, the 1st of July marks the starting date for implementation related to AfCFTA.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The text doesn't mention specific issues with laws and regulations being resolved, only that they haven't been finalized.
*   **C:** While the AU Commissioner is mentioned, the text doesn't state that his approval is the reason for the July start date.
*   **D:** The text mentions the need to harmonize rules of origin, but doesn't say an agreement has been reached.

Here's why:

The text states that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution *published an investigation* revealing issues with test score discrepancies.  The subsequent arrests of 34 educators strongly implies the newspaper's work led to exposing their involvement in cheating.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ናይ ከበሳ ትምህርቲ ዘይምምሕያሾም (Failure to improve education)** - The text focuses on cheating, not overall educational improvement.
* **C: ኣብ ዝተረኽቡ ዉሽጣዊ ጸገማት ዘይምዕያዮም (Not addressing internal challenges)** - While the text mentions the school faced challenges, it doesn't say the educators *didn't address* them.  It says the challenges were revealed *despite* the inflated scores.
* **D: ትሑት ናይ ምርመራ ነጥብታት ጸብጻብ ምሃቦም (Providing insufficient investigation points)** - The text shows the newspaper provided a very detailed and impactful investigation.

Here's why:

The passage states that 34 educators were **indicted** (taken to court) in 2013. It doesn't say they were awarded or recognized in any way. The passage focuses on the scandal of cheating and the consequences faced by those involved.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned in the text:

*   **A: ዘይልሙድ ምምሕያሽ ነጥብታት ናይ ምርመራ** - The text directly states the superintendent showed ""great improvement in test scores.""
*   **B: ናይ ምርመራ ወረቓቕቲ ምትንኻፋት ከም ዝነበረ ዘርኢ መርትዖ** - The passage explicitly says ""test answer sheets were exchanged"" and ""evidence showed test scores were manipulated"".
*   **D: ርኢቶታት ናይ ከበሳ ትምህርቲ ንምምሕያሽ** - The text mentions that the superintendent received the ""National Superintendent of the Year award"" in 2009, demonstrating recognition for improving schools.

Here's why:

* The text states that while initial reports suggest 8 deaths and other reports up to 30 injuries, ""the final count has not yet been released."" This directly relates to the final casualty count.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ቡንባታት ኣብ ጥቓ ኣየኖት ህንጻታት ከም ዝተተኮሱ (Bombs were fired at the top of government buildings)** - The text mentions bombs *exploded* near a government building, but not fired *at* the tops.
* **C: ተወሰኽቲ ቡንባታት ክፍንጀሩ እንተኾይኖም (Several bombs were about to explode)** - The text states bombs *have* exploded, not that they were about to.
* **D: ወግዓዊ ናይ ሞት ክሳራ (Official death toll)** -  This is similar to A, but the text specifically says the *final* count isn't available, making A a more precise answer.

ካበየነይቲ ክለብ እዩ ጀሱስ ንምጽንባሩ £27 ሚልዮን ዝተኸፍለ?,"The correct answer is **B: ማንቸስተር ሲቲ**.

The text states that Jesus moved to Manchester City for a fee of £27 million from Palmeiras in 2017.  Therefore, Manchester City is the club that paid £27 million for him."

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""The majority of the hotel guests were citizens of the United Arab Emirates.""  This directly implies that *some* guests were *not* citizens of the UAE.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: እቶም ኣጋይሽ ኣብ ሜካ ንንግት መጽዮም ነበሩ (The guests came to Mecca for a visit):** The passage says they were there to perform Hajj, a specific pilgrimage, not just a general visit.
* **C: እቶም ኣጋይሽ ንድሮ ናይ ሃጅ እዮም መጽዮም (The guests came to Mecca for Hajj):** The passage confirms this - ""many pilgrims who came to the holy city to perform Hajj were staying at the hotel.""
* **D: መብዝሓትኦም ካብቶም ኣጋይሽ ካብቲ ቕዱስ ከተማ ነበሩ (Most of the guests were from the holy city):**  The passage does *not* mention where the guests are originally from, only that most are from the UAE.

Here's why:

* **The text states the *estimated* number of deaths is *at least* 15.** This means the actual number could be higher.  Therefore, stating ""no one died"" is definitively false based on the provided information.

Let's look at why the other options are possible, but not *definitely* true:

* **B: ኩሎም ኣጋይሽ ካብ ሕቡራት ዓረብ ኢማራት ነበሩ (All the guests were from the United Arab Emirates):** The text says *most* of the guests were from the UAE, not *all*.
* **C: እቶም ኣጋይሽ ንድሮ ናይ ሃጅ ንግደት እዮም መጽዮም (The guests were on their way to Mecca for Hajj):** The text states the hotel was used by pilgrims traveling to Mecca for Hajj, but it doesn't confirm that *all* the guests present at the time of the collapse were pilgrims.
* **D: መብዝሓትኦም ካብቶም ኣጋይሽ ናይ ሜካ ነበርቲ ነበሩ (Most of the guests were residents of Mecca):** The text doesn’t provide information about where the guests normally live. It only mentions they were traveling *to* Mecca.

Here's why:

* **The passage states researchers are *still trying to determine* if the collision will cause significant damage to the ground.** This means they haven't yet established what the impact *is*. The other options are all clearly stated in the text:
    * **A: ዓቐን ናይቲ ግጭት** (Severity of the collision) - The passage says it was a ""major explosion.""
    * **B: ቦታ ናይቲ ግጭት** (Location of the collision) - It happened 491 miles above Earth.
    * **D: ቦታ ናይ ዝተሰባበረ** (Location of the satellites) - They were in orbit.

Therefore, the passage doesn't *provide* information about the *actual* impact on the ground, only that it's being investigated."

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that researchers are trying to determine ""how damaging the collision was"" and ""to what extent it might damage the Earth."" This directly relates to the extent of the damage caused by the collision.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ምንዳይ ናይቲ ዝተሰባበረ መን ክሕዞ እዩ (Who is responsible for the debris)** - The text doesn't focus on responsibility, but on the damage.
* **B: ኣብ ግዜ ናይቲ ግጭት ሳተላይት ማዕረ ክንደይ ቕልጣፈ ነበረን (What satellite altitude was at the time of the collision)** - While the altitude is mentioned (491 miles), the focus isn't on understanding the altitude itself, but the impact of the collision *at* that altitude.
* **C: ናይ ንድፊ ትንተና ዉጺኢታት ብኸመይ ከም ዝካፈሉ (How plot analysis results will be shared)** - The text mentions the results will be released publicly, but the *primary* concern being investigated isn't how that information will be disseminated.

The text states ""ካብ ቨርጂንያ ዩኒቨርስቲ ጥበባትን ሳይንስ ኮለጅ ተመሪቑ"". This directly indicates that the wealth was transferred to the University of Virginia.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: እቲ ዝርዝር ናይ ዝሃብተሙ ኣሜሪካዉያን** - The list simply *identifies* wealthy Americans, it doesn't receive the money.
*   **C: ብርክት ዝበሉ ትካላት** - The text doesn't mention other entities receiving wealth.
*   **D: ኮሌጃት ኣብ ቕብኣን ሳይንስን ዝተዋፈራ** - This is too general; the text specifically names the University of Virginia."

Here's why:

The passage states Schwarzenegger signed a law to restrict the sale or rental of violent video games to minors in California. This means there's a restriction on *selling or renting* such games *within* California. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ንበደልቲ ናይ ገንዘብ መቕጻዕታት (Penalties for retailers):** While the passage mentions a $1000 fine, it's not the *main* point of the law – it's a consequence of violating the restriction.

* **D: ናይ ማሕተም ሕጊ ኣብ ጎነጻዊ ናይ ቪድዮ ጸወታት (Labeling law for violent video games):** The passage mentions a rating of ""18"" being required, but the core of the law is the *restriction* of sales/rentals, not just labeling.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ዝተበሃሉ ነገራት መን ሓሊፉዎ?,"The correct answer is **B: ማይክ**.

Here's why:

The passage states Miller was trying to ask Mike what he said because Mike was talking a lot during the meeting and Miller couldn't hear him clearly. Therefore, the things spoken were said by **Mike**. 

Here's the relevant part of the text:

""ሚለር ንርኢቶ ክሕተት እንከሎ """"ማይክ ኣብቲ እዋን ምስማዕ መጋባኣያ ብዙሕ እዩ ለፍሊፉ፤ እንዳተዳለውኩ ስለዝነበረ ብሓቂ እንታይ ይብል ከምዝነበረ ኣይሰማዕኽዎን"""" "" (Miller was trying to ask what Mike said because Mike talked a lot during the meeting and he couldn't hear what he was saying.)

Here's why:

* The passage states Miller said, ""Mayk ኣብቲ እዋን ምስማዕ መጋባኣያ ብዙሕ እዩ ለፍሊፉ፤ እንዳተዳለውኩ ስለዝነበረ ብሓቂ እንታይ ይብል ከምዝነበረ ኣይሰማዕኽዎን"" (Mayk was very distracted during the meeting; because he was interpreting for me, he couldn't hear what he was actually saying). This directly indicates Miller couldn't follow the conversation properly *because* he was interpreting, meaning he wasn't able to participate fully or have a clear understanding of what was being said.  This equates to not being able to respond effectively during that time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብቲ ጉባኤ ዱቫል ኣብ ልዕሊ ሚለር ጦብላሕታ ገበረ (Duval attacked Miller at the meeting)** - The passage doesn't mention any attack. It only states Duval spoke at length.
* **C: እቶም ንዱቫል ክልተ ደቑ ኣብቲ ጉባኤ ብዙሕ ይዛረቡ ነበሩ (Those who supported Duval were arguing a lot at the meeting)** - The passage mentions the length of Duval's speech, but not arguments amongst supporters.
* **D: ንታሪኽ ናይ ዱቫል ጽቡቕ ኣቓልቦ ሂቡ ነበረ (He gave a good response to Duval's history)** -  The passage suggests Miller *couldn't* follow the details of Duval's speech, therefore couldn't respond.

Therefore, Stephen Harper is the one who proposed revisiting the ‘Clean Air Plan’."

Therefore, a Prime Minister is the one questioning the ""Clean Air Plan"" as a pre-election tactic."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኮላሊት** - The passage doesn't mention 콜라리트.
* **B: ናይ ገዛ እንስሳ መግቢ** - The passage talks about contaminated pet food, but doesn't say that the mixture *creates* pet food.
* **D: ኢንፍራረድ ስፐክትሮስኮፒ** - This is a method used for *analyzing* the crystals, not what is created when the compounds are mixed.

Here's why:

* The passage states that researchers used FTIR spectroscopy to **compare the structure of the crystals they created with the crystals found in the urine of affected animals.**  This directly links FTIR to analyzing crystal structure *in urine*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ዕዮ ናይ ኩሊት (Kidney stones):** While the crystals *can* form kidney stones, FTIR wasn't used to look at the stones themselves, but what was *in* the urine.
* **C: ዝተተንከፉ ናይ ገዛ እንስሳ (Affected animals):** FTIR was used on the crystals, not the animals directly.
* **D: ዝተበከለ መግቢ ናይ ገዛ እንስሳ (Contaminated animal feed):** The research focuses on what happens *after* the animals consume the contaminated feed, specifically the crystals formed in their urine.

The text states: ""ቶሚ ድሪመር፣ “ሉና እታ ቀዳመይቲ ንግስቲ ናይ ሕሉፍነት እያ ነይራ።"" (Tommy Dremer, “Luna is the first queen of lightness.”) 

Therefore, Tommy Dremer is the one who referred to Luna as “queen of lightness”."
ንሉና ከም “ስንግጢር” ዝጠቐሳ መን ነበረ?,"The correct answer is **D: ቶሚ ድሪመር**.

The text states: ""ቶሚ ድሪመር፣ “ሉና እታ ቀዳመይቲ ንግስቲ ናይ ሕሉፍነት እያ ነይራ።"" which translates to ""Tommy Dremer, “Luna is the first queen of fitness.” This is the closest equivalent to calling Luna a ""sngtir"" (champion)."

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""እቲ መራሕ ማኪና ኣብ ርእሱ ኸቢድ ጉድኣት ወረዶ (The driver sustained serious head injuries).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ ዉሽጢ እቲ ገዛ ካብ ዝነበሩ ሰባት ንወላሓደ ኣይጎደአን (No one inside the house was harmed)** - This is true, but it's what *didn't* happen to the driver, not what *did*.
* **C: ካብ ኣብ ካምብሪጅ ዝነበር ሆስፒታል ናብ ግሬት ያርማዉዝ ተሰጋገረ (He was transferred from the hospital in Cambridge to Great Yarmouth)** - The driver was moved *to* Cambridge hospital, not *from* it.
* **D: ኣገልጉሎታት ህጹጽ ረዲኤት ካብ መኪንኡ ንምዉጻእ ሓገዙ (Emergency services helped extract him from the car)** -  The text says emergency services *freed* him from the car, which is different than him needing help to escape.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ስርዓት ዘለዎ ምክልካሎም ፣ ናይ ኩዕሶ ኣተሓሕዛ ክእለቶም ከምኡውን ጽቡቕ ናይ ጉጅለ ስርሖም ዓብሊሎም ንክወጹ ገርዎምን..."" which translates to ""Their organized passing, their ability to catch the ball, and their good teamwork helped them to excel...""

The passage specifically highlights *teamwork* as a standout quality of the South African team. The other options are mentioned as contributing factors, but teamwork is presented as the overarching strength.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ክእለት ናይ ኣተሓሕዛ ኩዕሶ (Ability to catch the ball):** While important, it's mentioned *alongside* teamwork, not as the defining factor.
*   **C: ኣብ መጀመርያ ናይቲ ጸወታ ዝተመሓየሸ ኣቐራርባ (The initial advantage in the game):** The passage talks about a good start against Zambia, but doesn't highlight this as what set South Africa apart in general.
*   **D: ናይ ምክልኻል ክእለታት (Passing skills):** Again, this is mentioned as *part* of their success, but not the overall defining characteristic.

This translates to: ""The South African team started well... but the momentum started building after their structured passing, ball handling skills, and good teamwork helped them advance.""

This clearly indicates the momentum (and therefore the increasing likelihood of winning) began **after** emphasizing their passing and teamwork.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣብ ከባቢ 10:00 ቅ.ቀ (Around 10:00 AM):** The text doesn't mention a specific time.
*   **C: ብዛምብያ ድሕሪ ምስዓሮም (After beating Zambia):** While winning against Zambia was a good start, the momentum specifically grew *after* improving their game fundamentals.
*   **D: እቲ ግጥም ኣብ ዝቐጸለሉ (When the game ended):** The text refers to the momentum building *during* the game, not just at the end."

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""ዝሓለፈ ዓመት ቻይና ንመጀመርታ ግዜ ካብ ጀርመን ንላዕሊ ማካይን ሰደደት"" (Last year, China surpassed Germany in exports for the first time). Therefore, option D is incorrect as the text proves China *did* surpass Germany in exports.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: ምምሕያሻት ድሕሪ ምግባሮም ናይ ቻይና ቑጠባ ኣዝዩ ዓበየ** (After reforms, the Chinese economy has grown very large) - The text states the economy grew by 90 times and is now the largest trading partner of the US.
* **B: ቻይና ካብ ናይ ሕቡራት መንግስታት ዝዓቢ ዕዳጋ ናይ መኪና ምስዳድ ኣለዋ** (China has a larger industrial debt than the United States) - The text directly states China became the largest creditor of the US.

Here's why:

The text states ሁ argued that developed nations shouldn't pressure others, but instead, **""ይኹን እምበር ልዕሊ ብርኪ ስልጣነኦም፣ሓላፍነቶምን ዓቅሞምን ዝኾኑ ግደታት ንኽወስዱ ክሕተቱ አይግባእን።""** which translates to **""but they shouldn't force others to take obligations exceeding their capabilities, responsibilities and powers.""**  This directly means developed nations should take obligations *appropriate* to their level of development.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ ናይ ቑጠባ ዉጺኢት ከተኩራ (To focus on economic output):** The text mentions China's economic growth but doesn't suggest Hu Jintao advocated for other nations to prioritize it.
* **C: ካብ ህሉዉ ሓላፍነታተን ንልዕሊ ክኸዳ (To exceed their existing responsibilities):** This is the *opposite* of what Hu Jintao argued.
* **D: ሕሉፍ ኣካይዳ ናይ ብከላ ከወግዳ (To adopt a defensive strategy):** The text doesn't discuss defensive strategies.



"
ብሁ ዘይተጠቕሰ እንታይ ነበረ?,"The correct answer is **A: መሰረት ነቶም ቐይድታት** (The basis of the reductions).

Here's why:

* The text states that Hu Jintao criticized the reductions without specifying *how* they were calculated or what the baseline was. He points out they were tied to China's economic output but doesn't detail the specific methodology used to determine the reduction targets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ብዛዕባ ብከላ ዝምልከት ምኽሪ ንኣብ ምዕበላ ዝርከባ ሃገራት** (Advice regarding defenses for countries facing pressure) - The text *does* mention Hu advising developing countries (""first endure, then repay"" strategy), so this *is* mentioned.
* **C: ናይ ካርቦን ምዝርጋሕ ክቓረጸሉ ዝትስፈዎ ዕለት** (The date by which carbon reductions were to be achieved) - The text mentions 2020 as the year to ""move towards"" a reduction from 2005 levels, so this *is* mentioned.
* **D: ስእሊ ንምቑራጽ ዝርጋሐ ካርቦን** (The amount of carbon planned to be reduced) - The text refers to reducing carbon dioxide, but doesn't state a specific amount, it just talks about reductions *relative* to 2005 levels.

Here's why:

The text states Richard Virman said ""the situation in Angola is very bad."" The question asks who Virman said the situation isn't good for. Therefore, the answer is Angola."

The text states that ""ሃህን ስልጣኑ ገዲፉ ከምኡውን ኣብ ካቢኔ ብ ኤድ ዳቨይ ናይ ፓርላማ ኣባል ክቅየር እዩ"" which translates to ""Huhn relinquished his power and is expected to be replaced in the cabinet by Ed Davery as a Member of Parliament."" 

Therefore, Davery will take over Huhn's cabinet position."

This indicates Lamb will be taking over the responsibilities of the outgoing minister."

The passage states ""እቶም ተዋሳእቲ ካናቢስ ኣብ መድረኽ ወጺዮም የትክኹ ነበሩ፣ እንኮላይ እቶም ተዓዘብቲ ትያትር ድማ ንኽስሕቡ ይተባብዑ ነይሮ።"" This directly translates to ""The associates were going up on stage to smoke cannabis, especially the theater-goers were urged to join them.""  This means the theater-goers were encouraged to participate in using cannabis during the opera performances.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ናብ ጃፓን መገሻ ንክኸዱ (To go on a trip to Japan)** - The passage mentions the artist's life being inspired by a love of Japan, but doesn't say the audience was encouraged to travel there.
* **C: ነቲ ምርኢት ኣብ መድረኽ ምስኦም ክሓብሩ (To join the performance on stage)** - While associates went on stage, the passage doesn't say *all* audience members were invited to join the performance.
* **D: ሂወቶም በቲ ዝፈትውዎ ንኽትምራሕ ከፍቕዱ (To have their lives guided by what they love)** - This relates to the artist's personal life, not what the audience was instructed to do.



"

The passage states that the supporters (ተዋሳእቲ) would go on stage and smoke, especially the theatre-goers, to show their appreciation.  Therefore, they were the ones smoking during the opera."

Here's why:

* The text states Leonov performed the first-ever ""spacewalk"" (ምንቅስቃስ ጠፈር), which is also known as an Extravehicular Activity (EVA) or ""space walk."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ተልእኾ ኣፖሎ-ሶዩዝ** - This was a mission Leonov *led* later in his career, not the name of his first spacewalk.
* **B: ቕድድም ጠፈር** - This is a general term, not the specific name of Leonov's spacewalk.
* **D: ኮስሞናት ቑ. 11** - This is Leonov's call sign, not the name of the spacewalk.



"
ሎዮኖቭ ነየናይ ክፋል ተልእኾ ናይ ሶቬት መሪሕዎ?,"The correct answer is **B: ኣፖሎ-ሶዩዝ**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""ድሕሪ ዓሰርተ ዓመት፡ ነቲ ብወገን ሶቪየት ዝርከብ ፡ እቲ ኣብ ህዋ ዝካየድ ዝነበረ ቅድድም ምብቃዑ ዘመልክት ናይ ኣፖሎ-ሶዩዝ ልኡኽ መሪሑ እዩ."" This directly translates to ""After ten years, he led the Soviet side of the Apollo-Soyuz mission, which was the first docking in space.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ቕድድም ጠፈር** - This refers to the first spacewalk, not a mission he led.
*   **C: ኮስሞናት ቑ. 11** - This was his initial mission, not a leadership role in another project.
*   **D: EVA** - EVA stands for Extravehicular Activity (spacewalk), which he *performed* but didn't *lead* a mission related to.

The text explicitly states: ""ድሕሪ እቲ ሓደጋ ምግጣሙ፣ ጊብሰን ናብ ሕክምና ተወስደ ግን ኣብ ሓጺር ግዘ ሞተ"" which translates to ""After the accident, Gibson was taken to the hospital but died shortly after.""  This indicates Gibson was the one injured and ultimately died *in* the accident.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: ናይ ገራጅ ሰራሕተኛ (Garage worker)** - The worker *witnessed* the aftermath but wasn't stated to be injured.
* **C: ቖልዑ (Young people)** - The text says they ""were fleeing"" and ""all left"", implying they weren't hit, just present.
* **D: መራሒ ዓባይ መኪና (Driver of the large vehicle)** - The text states the driver was unharmed (""ኣይተጎድአን"").

Here's why:

* The text states Gibson was taken to the hospital but died shortly after.
* The text states the 64-year-old driver of the truck was not injured in the accident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ክልቲኦም ሞይቶም** (Both died) - The driver did *not* die.
* **C: ምዉጫጭን ብኽያትን ነበረ** (There was confusion and chaos) - While the garage worker's statement suggests some confusion, the question asks what the *people involved* experienced, not the general atmosphere.
* **D: ክልቲኦም መጉዳእቲ ኣጋጢምዎም** (Both experienced injuries) - Only Gibson experienced a fatal injury.

The passage explicitly states: ""እዚ እማረ-ሓሳብ እሱ ክምዝበሎ ኣብ ዙርያ ጋላክሲ ዘሎ ቲ'ዝበዝሐ ናይ ጸልማት ነገር ጋላክሲ ኣብ ዙርያ ኣብ ሓደ ዓሙቕ ውሽጢ ክርከብ ዝከኣል ኮይኑ ምስ ብዙሕ ንኣሽቱ ንጥረ ነገር ዝተሰርሐ እዩ።""  This translates to ""This hypothetical substance is a dark matter halo surrounding the galaxy, capable of residing in a deep potential well and composed of much non-baryonic matter.""

The question asks what the researchers believe the ""צልዋታት (forces)"" are related to. The passage directly links the forces to this dark matter halo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ረጉላር ማተር (Regular matter):** The passage describes something *different* from regular matter (""non-baryonic matter"").
*   **B: ናይ ማዕበል ሓይልታት (Tidal forces):** While tidal forces are *mentioned* as an analogy (like the moon's effect on Earth), they aren't the primary substance the researchers are focusing on.
*   **C: ደቐቕቲ ጥረታት (Precise attempts):** This isn't related to the scientific phenomenon described.

Here's why:

The passage states that the researchers are studying the gravitational force between the Sagittarius Galaxy and the Milky Way, comparing it to the gravitational relationship between the Earth and the Moon.  Therefore, they are observing both Sagittarius Galaxy and Milky Way.

Here's why:

The passage discusses the aftermath of a hurricane, focusing on the rebuilding process (""ዳግም ህንጸት"" - reconstruction). It mentions negative consequences (""ድኽነትን መሊስካ ህንጸትን"" - hardship and devastation) and financial burdens associated with the reconstruction efforts.  The passage specifically refers to contracts related to this reconstruction (""ናይ ቡሽ ናይ ኦርሊያንስ ስምምዕ"" - Bush-Orleans agreement).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ናይ ረዲኤት ወጻኢታት (Radio outcomes):** The passage doesn't mention radio.
* **B: ጻዕሪ ዳግመ ህንጸት ዘይምህላዉ (Failure to provide reconstruction):** The passage doesn't state that reconstruction *didn't* happen, only that it came with problems.
* **C: ናይ ዳግመ ህንጸት ኮንትራት ዝወሃብ ዘሎ መን’ዩ (Who gives reconstruction contracts):** While contracts are mentioned, the passage doesn't specifically identify *who* awards them.

The text states: ""ዳግም ህንጸት ናይ ነጻነት ወቐሳ ዳግም ናይ ዝህነጹ ውዕላት ንነበርቲ ዋሺንግቶን ኣብ ምሃብ ዝጠመተ እዩ።"" 

This translates to: ""The re-establishment of freedom's funds again are focused on giving to the members of Washington.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly identifies members of Washington as those who provide the funds for the recovery efforts."

The text states: ""The meteor is expected to be visible as a brilliant streak across the sky to those in northern California, Oregon, Nevada and Utah as it approaches the Earth's atmosphere at 5 PM (Pacific Daylight Time)."" This indicates that northern California is one of the first places where the meteor will be seen.

While the meteor is also visible in Oregon, Nevada, and Utah, the text specifically mentions northern California first. Idaho is not mentioned in the text.

Here's why:

* The passage describes the meteor as appearing as a ""streaking light"" and says it will ""light up the sky."" This directly relates to the concept of a bright light in the sky.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ ዝበዝሓ ከተማታት ምርኣያ:** While the meteor is visible to people in cities, the passage focuses on its overall visibility across multiple states, not just urban areas.
* **C: ናብ ዓለም ዝቐልጠፈት ምምላሳ:**  The meteor is described as entering the Earth's atmosphere, but the focus isn't on a broad ""message"" to the world.
* **D: ካብ ሳን ፍራንሲስኮ ናብ ሎስ ኣንጀልስ ዝቐልጠፈት ምኻዳ:** The speed between these cities is a detail *about* the meteor, not what it's ultimately doing or providing.

Here's why:

The passage states eBay is hoping to ""accelerate international growth"" by focusing on markets like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil. This directly aligns with expanding into new areas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣታዊኡ ከወሃህድ (To increase its revenue)** - While expansion *could* lead to increased revenue, the passage doesn't explicitly state this as the primary goal. It focuses on *where* they're expanding, not simply increasing income.
*   **C: ስሙ ክብ ከብል (To improve its reputation)** - Reputation isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: ንወነንቲ ብርክታቱ ከዕግብ (To reward its investors)** - Investor rewards are not discussed.

    * **B: ጉጅለ መጥፋእቲ ሓዊ (Hawai Destruction Group)** - This group dispersed the Hawaiians.
    * **D: ሰራሕተኛታት ሆስፒታል (Hospital Staff)** - Hospital staff were only mentioned receiving the injured students.

Therefore, the police are the only group explicitly stated to have interacted with the students who remained."

* The passage states that a ""hawy bar'e'"" (smoke barrier) was deployed around the hostages.
* Later, the ""guijle ሓዊ ምክልኻል"" (smoke clearing team) dispersed the smoke at 11:35.

Therefore, the smoke is what was used to help remove the hostages from the situation.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ዕዉት ምዉዕዓል (True understanding)** - This isn't a physical element used to remove the hostages.
* **B: መንብዒ ጋዝ (Gas bomb)** - While a gas bomb *could* be used, the text specifically mentions smoke.
* **C: ዝተጎዱኡ ማተሳስርቶም (Their injured transports)** - This refers to the initial situation of the wounded being taken to the hospital, not what removed the hostages.

Here's why:

The passage states that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei calls Iran's self-reliance in oil as something ""to be achieved"" and that the country needs it ""to achieve its independence.""  This directly links independence to being free from reliance on oil revenue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ገንዘባዊ ቐይድታት (Financial restrictions)** - While the passage mentions financial sanctions, Khamenei doesn't frame independence *as* overcoming financial restrictions, but as something related to oil.
*   **B: እቲ ናይ እምነት ምስልምና ሰዉራ (The Islamic faith structure)** - The passage mentions the 1979 Islamic revolution, but Khamenei's quote doesn't directly tie independence to religious faith.
*   **C: ናይ ወጻኢ ኣታዊ (Foreign income)** - This is related to oil revenue, but the specific focus is on *independence* from relying on that revenue.

The text states that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called the oil embargo created after the 1979 Islamic Revolution of Iran a ""weapon"" and that the country needs it to achieve its independence. This indicates he believes oil is a key factor in Iran's economic leverage and strength.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ዓበይቲ ምንጭታት (Major Sources):** The text doesn’t specify who believes it's a weapon, only Khamenei.
* **B: OPEC:** While the text mentions OPEC and oil production, it doesn't say they believe oil is a weapon of leverage.
* **D: ሕብረት ኤውሮጳ (European Union):** The EU imposed sanctions, they are not described as believing oil is a source of strength for Iran.

The text states: ""ኣቐዲሙ ዝተሓትመ ንዝመረጽዎ ሕጹይ ዘመልክት ቆጽሊ ወረቐት ናብ ሓደ ቡስጣ የእትዉ।"" This translates to ""They put a pre-completed ballot for their chosen candidate into an envelope.""  This means voters mark their choices on a pre-printed ballot.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

The passage explicitly links Allen's eight-year pursuit of Musashi to his passion for ocean exploration, fueled by his adventures and wealth spent on it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሃብቱ (His wealth)** - While Allen *used* his wealth, the passage doesn't say wealth itself was what drove him to Musashi.
*   **B: ተገዳስነቱ ምሕንጻጽ ካርታ ኣብ ናይ ባሕሪ መሬት (His struggle to map the ocean floor)** - The passage mentions his ocean exploration, but not specifically mapping the seafloor.

The text states, ""ኣለን ንሙሳሺ ንሸሞንተ ዓመት ዝገበሮ ኣለሻ ዛዘሞ"" which translates to ""He spent the money he had been saving for eight years to hire Mushashi.""  This directly indicates where Allen spent a significant amount of his money.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ምድህሳስ ባሕሪ (Sea diving):** While Allen was involved in sea diving, the text doesn't say he *spent* his savings on it.
* **C: ROV ኣብ ምስራሕ (ROV Operation):** The ROV was used to *recover* the shipwreck, but the text doesn't say Allen spent his savings on the ROV itself.
* **D: ብዛዕባ ምሕንጻጽ ካርታ ናይ ባሕሪ መሬት (Mapping the sea floor):** This isn't mentioned in the text at all.

Here's why:

The text states that the leaks from the facility could spread uranium-containing burnt fuel. This directly implies that uranium is a hazardous substance that could create a dangerous situation in the surrounding area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ፈነወ-ጸርጊ ሲዝየም (Radioactive Cesium):** While the text mentions radioactive cesium is *present* at the facility, it doesn't suggest it's leaking and creating a dangerous situation.
*   **C: ጻዕዳ ትኪ (TV report):** This is the source of the information, not a hazardous material itself.
*   **D: ኣዮዲን (Iodine):** Similar to cesium, the text mentions radioactive iodine is present but doesn't link it to a potential spread or danger.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that officials advised residents to stay indoors, close windows, and not drink tap water.** This is because radioactive cesium and iodine were detected at the factory, and there's concern about uranium dust being released.
* **Wearing masks (specifically filtering masks) is the most direct way to protect against inhaling radioactive particles released into the air.** 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ ዉሽጢ ክጸንሑ (To stay indoors):** While staying indoors is *part* of the advice, it doesn't directly address the need to filter the air.
* **C: ጻዕዳ ትኪ ንዉሽጢ ምስትንፋስ ክዉገዱ (To breathe in the factory smoke indoors):** This is the opposite of what's recommended! The text implies the issue originates *from* the factory, and breathing that air is dangerous.
* **D: ናይ ቡንባ ማይ ካብ ምስታይ ክዉገዱ (To avoid drinking tap water):**  Avoiding tap water protects against ingesting contaminants, but the primary concern mentioned is airborne radioactive particles, making a mask the most relevant immediate precaution.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Dr. Mol described the new strain as ""particularly alarming because of its extremely high mortality rate."" This directly addresses what makes XDR-TB so concerning according to him.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: እቲ ሕማም ዘምጽእ ኣብቲ ሆስፒታል ምልብዑ:** While the hospital setting is mentioned as a potential source of spread, it's not the primary concern Dr. Mol highlights.
* **B: ናይቲ ሕማም ዘምጽእ ተጻዋርነት ንመድሃኒታት:** The passage does state that it's a drug-resistant strain (XDR-TB *means* extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis), but Dr. Mol's immediate concern is the high death rate.
* **C: ሓደ ዝተጠቕዐ ሰብ ክለኽፎም ዝኽእል መጠን ሰባት:**  The passage mentions the potential for spread (10-15 people), but again, the doctor's focus in the quote is the mortality rate.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ዶክተር ሞል ብውሕዱ እቶም ክልተ፣ ሰራሕተኛታት እቲ ሆስፒታል ከምዝነበሩ ይሓስብ፡፡"" This translates to ""Doctor Mole suspects that two hospital staff were among those he infected.""

Therefore, the passage directly confirms that 2 health workers are believed to have contracted the new strain of the disease from the patient."

The passage clearly states that NextGen utilizes ""ብሳተላይት ዝተመስረተ ቴክኖሎጂ"" (satellite-based technology) which is different from the older ""መሬት-ራዳር ዝተመስረተ ቴክኖሎጂ"" (ground-radar-based technology)."

Here's why:

The passage states that NextGen ""allows for shorter flight paths"" and is a system designed to help controllers manage air traffic and ""optimize routes"". This directly translates to shorter flight paths being a benefit to air traffic controllers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ዝለዓለ ብሉጽ ናይ ነፈርቲ ቦታታት** (More efficient use of airport space): While NextGen *could* contribute to this indirectly, it’s not the direct benefit mentioned for controllers.
*   **C: ናይ ካርቦን ምዉጻእ የጉድል** (Reduces carbon emissions): This is an *outcome* of NextGen, but not how it directly helps controllers.
*   **D: ዝወሓደ ነዳዲ** (Saves fuel): Similar to carbon emissions, this is a result of NextGen, not a direct benefit to controllers.

Here's why:

The text states the FBI historians focused on cases that were ""easy to close"" in order to ""highlight the effectiveness of FBI resources.""  This directly relates to measuring the ""level of success"" (ተዓዋትነት መጠን) of the FBI.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ናብ ብቐሊል ክፍቱሑ ዝኽእሉ ገበናት ንዋት ምምዳብ** (Managing cases that are easy to open) - The text says they chose *cases that were easy to *close*, not easy to *open*.
* **C: ኣብ ጉዳያት ናይ ፖርኖግራፊ ልዑል ኣተኩሮ ምሃብ** (Giving high attention to pornography cases) - The text doesn't mention pornography cases at all.
* **D: ጉዳያት ዝተሰርቓ ማኪና** (Car theft cases) -  While the text mentions ""cases involving theft"", it doesn't specifically focus on car theft and it's just one example.  The core purpose was measuring success rates.

The text states the JAS 39C Gripen ""ተጋጭያ ምስ ተባርዐት"" (collided with). This directly answers the question about what the JAS 39C Gripen collided with.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ተገምጢላ (Hit/Struck):** While a collision involves striking, ""ተጋጭያ"" specifically means a collision.
* **C: ተፈንጂራ (Exploded):** The text mentions the aircraft crashed, but not that it exploded.
* **D: ነዳዲ ወዲኣ (Fuel ran out):**  There's no mention of fuel issues in the text.

The text states ""እቲ መዕርፎ ነፈርቲ ንግዳዊ በረራታት ዕጹው ኮይኑ"" which translates to ""The air force confirmed the pilot was a casualty."" This directly indicates the air force was reporting the pilot's death (a casualty)."

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""ካብ ቦቤክ ንላዕሊ ነታ ክለብ ዝተሰለፈ ይኹን ብዙሕ ጎል ዘእተወ ሰብ የለን"" (No one who has played for the club has scored more goals than Bobek).  This directly translates to option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  While he played over 468 games, this doesn't highlight a *record* or something special about his performance. It's simply a number.
* **C:** The passage states he *was named* the greatest player in the club's history in 1995, not that he *was awarded* anything.
* **D:** The passage states how many games he played and goals he scored, but doesn't compare his *number of appearances* to other players. It focuses on his *goalscoring* record.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ንሱ ኣብ 1945 ተጸንቢርዎም, ክሳዕ 1958 ድማ ጸኒሑ."" This directly translates to ""He joined Partizan in 1945 and remained until 1958.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage mentions he was *born* in Zagreb, but doesn't say he played for a Zagreb team before Partizan.
* **C:** He played until 1958, not 1995. 1995 is when he was *recognized* as Partizan's greatest player.
* **D:** The passage states he was *named* the greatest player, it doesn't say he received recognition for playing.

Here's why:

* The text states ሄስፐሮኝችስ is believed to have been fully feathered, moving on two legs. This distinguishes it from velociraptors, as the complete feathering is a specific characteristic mentioned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ክልተ ኣእጋር ኣለዎ** - The text says it moved on two legs, which is common for many dinosaurs, including velociraptors. This isn't a distinguishing feature.
* **B: ዝዓበየ ካልኣይ ጽፍሪ ኣለዎ** - While the text mentions the second claw was larger and led to the name ""western claw,"" this is how *it got its name*, not a fundamental difference from velociraptors.
* **D: ዉዑይ ደም እዩ** - The text doesn't mention anything about being warm-blooded.

Here's why:

The text states that ""ሄሰፐረንይከስ (Hesperornyx) ዝብላ ስም ተዋሂብዎ ትርጉሙ ድማ “ምዕራባዊ ጽፍሪ” እዩ።"" which directly translates to ""was given the name Hesperornyx, and its meaning is ""western claw"""". 

Therefore, the name ""Hesperornyx"" originates from a description of its claws.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: እቲ በዓል-ቤትን እታ በዓልቲ-ቤትን ክልቲኦም ካብ ቴክሳስ እዮም** - The passage only states the *victims* were originally from Texas. It doesn't say anything about the shooter's origin.

* **C: እቶም መጻምድቲ ቅድሚ ሓደ ዓመት ኣብ ባፍሎ ተመርዕዮም** - The passage states they moved to Buffalo *before* the shooting, but were originally from Texas.

* **The text states:** ""The accident happened at a Buffalo event commemorating the 100 people who died in the American Airlines Flight 343 crash.""
* **Option A** directly reflects this information, stating the incident occurred at an annual memorial in Buffalo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The text doesn't mention a ""formal"" memorial, just an annual commemoration.
* **C:** The accident didn't happen *in* Texas, but the victims were from a flight originating there. The accident occurred in Buffalo.
* **D:** The text specifies the event was a memorial, not a wedding celebration (m'tsamdeti m'rea).

Here's why:

* The text states the workers were initially afraid the pipe would burst (""ይፈሪሖም ኔሮም"" - they were afraid) which represents a danger to the workers. This fear stems from the pressure within the pipeline. While the other options are mentioned in the text, they aren't the *initial* concern of the workers regarding the launch.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ናይ ዱኽዒ ካርጎ ዘይምህላዉ (Lack of cargo on the barge):** This is mentioned, but it's not the *first* problem discussed.
* **B: ማዕበላትን ልዑል ንፋሳትን (Tides and strong winds):** These are conditions present, but the workers' immediate worry is the pipe.

Here's why:

*   **The text states the helicopter rescued the ten workers who were trapped in the collapsed shaft.** This means no one fell into the shaft.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: እቲ ዕንወት ቅድሚ ምልዓል ናይቲ ካርጎ ኣጋጢሙ** - The text indicates the incident happened while they were trying to open the pipe (""ቶም ቱቦ ከፍስስ ይኸእል እዩ"").
*   **B: እታ መርከብ ኣብ ግዜ ናይቲ ዕንወት 100 ሜተር ናይ ነዳዲ ኣብ ደገ ነበራ** - The text mentions the ship was 100 meters long and being used to try to reinforce the column.
*   **D: እታ መርከብ ናብቲ መዕገቲ ማይ ተደፊኣ** - The text states the pipe leads to the flowing water, and the collapse involved a strong wind and waves.

Therefore, option C is the only statement not supported by the text."

The passage states the crowds were so large in Rome that people couldn't get to the grave at St. Peter's Square. To accommodate the huge number of people, *large television screens were set up in **various locations throughout Rome** to watch the ceremony.* 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ኣብ ዝተፈላለያ ናይ ዓዲ-ጥልያን ከተማታት:** While similar setups existed in other Italian cities, the question asks where the television screens were used *because* people couldn't access the grave directly. This was primarily a Rome issue.
*   **C: ኣብ ሓድ ሓደ ቦታታት ናይ ፖላንድ:** The passage mentions similar arrangements in Poland, but doesn't state the screens were set up there *because* people couldn't get to the grave.
*   **D: ኣብ ቐጽሪ ናይ ሰይንት ፒተር:** The passage specifically says people *couldn't* get to the grave at St. Peter's Square, which is why the screens were needed elsewhere.

Here's why:

The passage states that because so many people came to Rome for the funeral, the public had to gather in different locations throughout the city to watch on large television screens. This indicates the funeral was not contained to one place like St. Peter's Square.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ ፖላንድ (In Poland):** While Poland had similar setups, the funeral itself was primarily in Rome.
* **C: ኣብ ቐጽሪ ናይ ሰይንት ፒተር (At the Square of Saint Peter):**  The passage explicitly states people *couldn't* get to St. Peter's Square due to the massive crowds.
* **D: መጀመርታ ኣብ ሮማ፡ ቐጺሉ ኣብ ካልእ ናይ ዓዲ-ጥልያን ከተማ (First in Rome, then in other Italian cities):** The passage doesn't mention the funeral being held in other cities, only that similar viewing setups were made there.

*   **C: ናይ ጋዝ ወጋዓዊ ትካል** - The gas company sent someone to investigate, but weren’t the ones receiving treatment.

*   **C: ናይቲ ናይ ጋዝ ትካል ሰበ-ስልጣን** (a gas company official) - While a gas company official *responded* to the report, they didn't *make* the initial report.

The text states, ""ሽናይደር ... ካብ ቲታንዩም እተሰርሐ ገጽ ኣለዎ"" (Shinader ... had a face made of titanium). Titanium is a metal. Therefore, the metal face belonged to Shinader."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ራግቢ** - The text says rugby is being *considered* for inclusion, not removed.
*   **C: ቤዝቦል** - Baseball is being *reconsidered* for inclusion, not removed currently.

The question asks which sport received votes from the national Olympic committees to be included.  The text specifically says Rugby Union (ሕብረት ራግቢ) was recommended alongside golf.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሮለር ስፖርትታት (Roller Sports):** The passage states these were *considered* to be included but weren't specifically highlighted as receiving votes.
*   **B: ቤዝቦል (Baseball):**  This sport was previously removed from the Olympics and is mentioned as being in contention, but not as receiving a clear vote of support.

ጊነስ ኣብ ነፍሲ ወከፍ ዓመት ክንደይ ዝኣክል ቢልዮን ዶላራት የእቱ?,"The correct answer is **D: 10**.

The text states that Guinness now generates over 10 billion Euros (14.7 billion US dollars) annually. The question asks about the billion dollar amount, and 10 is the closest value given in the text."
ኣብ ሕቡራት ኤሮፓ ኣብ ክንደይ ዝኣኽላ ሃገራት እቲ ቫይረስ H5N1 ተለልዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ሽዱሽተ (Six)**.

Here's why:

The text lists the following countries as having confirmed cases of H5N1:

1. France
2. Austria
3. Germany
4. Slovenia
5. Bulgaria
6. Greece
7. Italy

That's a total of seven countries, however the last sentence mentions that France is a member of the European Union and the other six countries are too. Therefore the answer is six as the question asks about confirmed cases *within Europe*."
ናይ H5N1 ቫይረስ ኣብ ቐረባ እዋን ዝተለልየሉ ቦታ ኣበይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ፈረንሳ (France)**.

The text clearly states the H5N1 outbreak was confirmed in France, specifically in the Marshland area of Lyon, eastern France. The other options are either not mentioned as having confirmed cases (Denmark, Greece) or are listed as countries *affected* by the virus but not where a recent outbreak was *confirmed* (Germany)."

Here's why:

The text states: ""ወታደራት ቅድሚ ምብጽሖም ሃይቲ ካብ 1800 ታት ጀሚሩ ምስቲ ሕማም ዝተተሓሓዙ ጸገማት ኣጋጢሞማ ኣይፈልጡን.""  This directly translates to ""Before the soldiers arrived, Haiti had been facing problems related to the illness since the 1800s.""  This indicates the illness existed in Haiti *before* the peacekeepers arrived.
"
ካበየናይ ቦታ ዝመጸ ጎሓፍ እዩ ኣብ ምልባዕ ናይቲ ሕማም ኢድ ዝነበሮ?,"The correct answer is **A: እቲ ፈለግ ኣርቲቦኔይት (The Artibonite River)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the cholera outbreak in Haiti was linked to the introduction of bacteria carried by UN peacekeepers. It then specifies that this bacteria was an **Artibonite strain**, meaning it originated from or was found in the Artibonite River.  The text explicitly connects the introduction of the bacteria to the peacekeepers and then identifies the source of the bacteria as originating from that river.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: እቲ ናይ ሕቡራት ሃገራት መዓስከር (The UN military)** - While the UN peacekeepers *brought* the cholera, they weren't the *source* of the bacteria itself. They were the vector.
* **C: ቦታ ናይ 2010 ምንቕጥቓጥ መሬት (The site of the 2010 earthquake)** - The earthquake created conditions that might have worsened the spread, but it didn’t introduce the bacteria.
* **D: ናይ ሃቲያን ትካል ንፍትሕን ዲሞክራስን (The Haitian Institute for Justice and Democracy)** - This organization investigated the outbreak, but wasn't the source of it.



"
እቲ ናይ ኣይሪሽ መንግስቲ እንታይ ክገብር እዩ መደብ ዘለዎ?,"The correct answer is **B: ኣብ ተፈቓድነት ናይ ሓሽሽ ኣዝዮም ተረርቲ ዝኾኑ ሕግታት ከተኣታቱ (To enact laws that would allow for regulated access to cannabis)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the government is considering a bill, and a government spokesperson said it's ""essential"" the law be passed ""as quickly as possible in the interests of public health and consumer protection.""  The Minister for Health also mentioned addressing the current unregulated situation and the potential for harmful products.  This all points to the government intending to *regulate* cannabis, which would involve enacting new laws about its use and sale.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ንናይ ሓሽሽ ገበነኛታት ፍርዲ ክህብ (To provide redress for cannabis users)** - The passage doesn't mention providing compensation.
*   **C: ኣብ ተፈቓድነት ናይ ሓሽሻት ሕግታት ከፍኹሶም (To relax existing cannabis laws)** - While the current situation is ""unconstitutional changes"", the goal is not simply relaxation, but *regulation* through new laws.
*   **D: ሓሽሻት ገበን ምዃኖም ከቛርጾም (To declare cannabis legal)** - This is too simplistic. The aim is not just legality, but *regulated* legality with rules for safety and consumer protection.



"
ኣብ ኣይርላንድ ንግዚኡ ሕጋዊ ዝኾነ እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **D: ሓሽሻት (Hashish)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Minister of Health expressed concern about ""ሕጊ ብዝተኽኣለ መጠን ቀልጢፉ ክውሰን ኣገዳሲ እዩ"" regarding substances people are using and ""ኣትሒዙ ምስ ሓሽሽ ዝተተሓሓዘ ገበን"". This directly links the discussion to the legal status of hashish.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ስርቒ (Thief)** - Not mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: ምትላል (Trespassing)** - Not mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: መጥቓዕቲ (Accusation)** - While the situation involves potential legal changes, the focus isn't on accusations themselves, but on the substance being used."
ዝተጠርጠር ገበነኛ ንምንታይ እዩ ዝጻረ?,"The correct answer is **A: ንምጥሓስ (To deceive)**.

Here's why:

The text states the suspect used symbols to ""ተዛሪቦ"" (communicate) *from above* and altered the ""O"" in a symbol to look like an ""e,"" using colors.  This suggests a coded message intended to **deceive** or mislead, rather than cause physical harm, a violation, or theft. The alteration of the symbol is a deliberate act of misrepresentation.
"

Here's why:

The passage states the symbol was altered by changing the ""O"" to an ""e"" – meaning one of the letters was changed. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ብናይ ሰላም ምልክት ኣማላኺዕዎ (It was covered with a peace sign):** The passage states the alteration *used* a peace symbol, it wasn't covered *by* one.
* **C: ብኣካላዊ መልክዕ ኣዕኒዎ (It was physically destroyed):** The passage explicitly says the symbol ""wasn't defaced"" (ኣይተበላሸወን).
* **D: ንከዕርዮ ቴንዳ ተጠቒሙ (Used a key change):** This doesn't relate to the information given in the text.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""ኣበይቲ ረክለማት ኣብ ኣውቶቡሳት ብዘይ ፍቓድ ብምልጣፉን..."" This directly indicates that Carno engaged in unauthorized bus travel, meaning he didn't follow regulations or obtain permission.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ምግሃስ መሰል ቕዳሕ (Giving basic education):** The text mentions Carno was a modern education and Kings Glory teacher with 9,000 students, indicating he *did* provide education.
* **B: ተማሃሪት ብዕርክነት ምዉጻእ (Expelling students arbitrarily):** The text implies problematic behavior and a disrespectful attitude towards students (""treating students like 'monkeys'""), suggesting potential arbitrary actions, but doesn't directly state expulsions.
* **D: ኣብ ክፍሊ ርኹስ ቛንቛ ምጥቓም (Using vulgar language in class):** The text explicitly states he used ""offensive language"" in the classroom.

Here's why:

The text states ""ሮናልዶ ሜንዶዛ ንበፃሕቲ ብኤም16 ጥይት ተኲሱሎም።"" which translates to ""Rolando Mendoza shot the hostage takers with an M16 rifle.""  This clearly indicates he was a police officer who turned rogue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ገያሾ (Kidnapper)** - The text states he *shot* the hostage takers, not that he *was* a hostage taker.
*   **C: ቖልዑ (Tourists)** - He attacked the tourists, he wasn't one of them.
*   **D: ሰኣልቲ (Hostages)** - He was the one *shooting* at people, he wasn't being held hostage.

The text states: ""ብዙሓት ተታሒዞም ዝነበሩ ክድሕኑ ከለዉ ብንእሽተዩ 6 ክዓ ከምዝሞቱ ተረጋጊጹ ኣሎ። ፊሊፒናውያን ፎቶ ሰአልቲ፣ ህፃናትን ሽማግለታትን ወሲኹ 6 ተዓጊቶም ዝነበሩ እሱራት ቅድም ኢሎም ተፈቲሖም እዮም።"" This directly translates to: ""Many of those held hostage were about to be rescued when it was confirmed that 6 would die. Filipinos, taking photos, opened the doors of the bus where 6 were held hostage, including photographers, children and the elderly.""

The text specifically mentions that *the elderly* (ገያሾ) were among those held hostage and were about to be rescued when the situation escalated. It doesn't state the same about the other options.

The text states ""ሰልፈኛታት ናብ ብሄራዊ ጉባኤ ኣብ ሕዳር ዝቐርብ ናይ 1.2 ሚልዮን ፌርማ ዝሓዘ ሰነድ ክረኽቡ ይትስፈዉ።"" This translates to ""Protesters plan to deliver a document with 1.2 million signatures to the National Congress in support of...""  This clearly indicates that the 1.2 million signatures are *in favor of* same-sex marriage legalization, meaning they are collected by supporters.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ሮበርቶ ጀፍርሶን (Roberto Jefferson):** He is the person *receiving* the bill, not collecting signatures.
*   **C: እቲ ናይ ሮማ ናይ ካቶሊኽ ቤተ-ክርስትያን (The Roman Catholic Church):** The text explicitly states the Church *opposes* same-sex marriage.
*   **D: ማርታ ሱፕሊስይ (Marta Suplicy):** She was the original author of the bill, not collecting recent signatures.

The passage states that the Roman Catholic Church ""strongly opposes"" same-sex civil unions in Brazil. The protesters are attempting to deliver a petition to the National Congress *because* of this opposition to the law.  Therefore, their opposition is directed toward the Roman Catholic Church.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ሮበርቶ ጀፍርሶን:** He is the one *receiving* the bill, not the target of the protests.
* **C: ነቲ ሃገራዊ ጉባኤ ናይ ብራዚል:** They are the recipients of the petition, but the opposition originates from the Catholic Church. The protesters are trying to influence the National Congress, not oppose it directly.
* **D: ኣማሓደሪ ናይ ሳኦ ፓዉሎ:**  While Marta Suplicy initially proposed a similar bill, the current opposition isn't directed at her.

The text states: ""ድሕሪ ሓሙሽተ ደቒቓ ምርኢት እቲ ንፋስ ምንፋስ ጀሚሩ..."" This directly translates to ""After five minutes of the show, the wind started to blow."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **C: ሓፍቱ ድሕሪ ምጥፍኣ (After the lightning):** There is no mention of lightning in the text.

The text states: ""ፍሬድ...ብ 35°W ብአንፈት ምብራቕ ካብ ዝተመዝገበ ሳልሳይ ዋና ኣውሎ ንፋስ ብቻ እዩ።"" This directly translates to ""Fred...is the third major hurricane located about 35°W, **east** of the coast.""

Therefore, after passing the Cape Verde islands, Fred moved **east**."

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that 802.11n offers a theoretical maximum speed of 600mbit/s, which is higher than the speeds of 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g.  The passage highlights its improvement over previous standards.

* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: ክእለት ናይ 802.11b ኣብ 5.0Ghz ክትዓዩ (The ability of 802.11b to operate on 5.0Ghz):** 802.11b operates on 2.4GHz, not 5.0GHz.  802.11n *can* operate on both, but this isn't what differentiates it from 802.11b.
    * **C: ዉጺኢት ናይ 600ሜጋባይት/ካ (Output of 600 Megabytes/second):** The passage states 600 *megabits* per second (mbit/s), not megabytes per second (MB/s). Even if it were MB/s, that's a specific speed, but the *reason* it's better is because of the overall faster speeds.
    * **D: ክልተ ራድዮታት (Two radios):** While 802.11n can utilize two radios, this is an *implementation detail* that contributes to the speed, but isn't the core difference between it and 802.11b. The speed is the primary differentiator.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the athlete was worried about being disqualified if they took the medications they needed because they had already participated in the Commonwealth Games.  This implies they feared a positive drug test due to the medication, not just general illness or inability to participate.
* **A** is incorrect: The passage doesn't say the athlete didn't want medication at all, but that they couldn't *take* it due to potential consequences.
* **B** is incorrect: While illness is mentioned, it's presented as a consequence of repeated injury, not the *reason* for avoiding medication.
* **D** is incorrect: The passage doesn't mention anything about the rules of the Commonwealth Games preventing medication use.

Therefore, the athlete avoided medication to avoid potential disqualification (a negative impact on their career)."

Here's why:

The text states: ""ብትኽክል ነታጒ ከምዝፈንደአ እቲ ደመና ምድንጋር ፈጢሩ ይርከብ"" which translates to ""As it vents, the smoke creates fog."" This directly links the smoke plumes to the formation of fog, which could obscure or alter the perception of ground disturbances.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ጸብጻባት ካብ ኣይስላንዲክ ቤት-ጽሕፈት ስነ ኣየራዊ (Reports from the Icelandic Meteorological Office):** These reports state there *wasn't* ground movement, they don't *cause* fog.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the Chandrayaan-1 *impacted* the Moon.**  It doesn't say it was a controlled landing (like a soft landing). The phrasing ""wediqa"" (crashed) confirms this.
* **A robot or remotely operated vehicle would be needed to perform a controlled soft landing.** The fact that it *impacted* at 1.5 km/s indicates it was not a soft landing managed by a robot.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: እቲ ድህሰሳ ኣገደስቲ መሳርሒታት ነበርዎ (The crash had the biggest instruments)** - The passage explicitly states it carried ""ሰለስተ ኣገደስቲ ናይ ሳይንስ ናውቲታት"" (three biggest scientific instruments). This is true.
* **C: ምዉጻእ ናይቲ ድህሰሳ ዕዉት ነበረ (The crash was successful)** - The passage says it crashed ""ብዓወት"" (successfully). It reached its intended location and performed its mission.
* **D: እቲ ዳህሳሲ ዝተለኸዩ ጎንታት ነበሮ (The crash had various sides)** - The passage mentions the lander had flags on ""ኩሉ ጎንታቱ"" (every side) which implies it wasn't a single impact point.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the lander ""landed successfully"" (ብዓወት ወዲቓ).**  ""ዕዉት"" means successful, making option B the most direct and accurate reflection of the passage's information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብ ጥቓ ሰሜን ጫፍ ናይ ወርሒ ዓሊቡ (It landed at the northern tip of the moon):** The passage says it landed on the *southern* pole (ደቡባዊ ዋልታ).

*   ""ኣሽሓት ላምስያታት ክዕደሉን"" (tightening quarantines)

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ጸረ-ባልዕ (Anti-malaria):** The text doesn't mention malaria or anti-malarial efforts.
*   **B: መትሓዚ ሓሸማ (False information):** While the passage mentions false rumors, the government's response wasn't focused on spreading or dealing with misinformation, but rather containment.
*   **C: ክታበታት ናይ ኢንሰፈላይትን (Encephalitis treatments):** The passage does not relate to encephalitis or its treatments.

Therefore, the passage clearly indicates the government intensified quarantine measures as a response to the outbreak."

The text states: ""...ካብኡ ብጣንጡ ኣቢሉ ናብ ወዲ ሰብ ፈሊሱ"" which translates to ""...it spread to humans *through mosquitoes*."" 

Therefore, mosquitoes are the method of transmission mentioned in the text."

Here's why:

The passage states that the second repeal of the ban could ""open the door to future civil unions to be established.""  This directly implies a possibility of legal recognition of same-sex relationships, leading towards the potential for marriage equality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ቐጥታዊ ገምጋም ናይ HJR-3 (Immediate enactment of HJR-3)** - The passage says the legal entity needs to *re-submit* HJR-3 for consideration in 2015/2016, not that it will be immediately enacted.
*   **C: ናይ ህጹጽ ሓጋጊ ክፍለ-ግዜ (A period of urgent litigation)** - While litigation is possible, the passage focuses on the *potential* for legal change through the legislative process, not necessarily immediate legal challenges.
*   **D: ምኽልካል ናይ ሕብረት ነበርቲ ሓደ-ጾታ (Criminalization of same-sex marriage)** - The passage indicates a *loosening* of restrictions, not a criminalization.

The text states: ""...the second full idea was again by the House of Representatives in Senu by a similar pattern after its establishment.""  ""Senu"" is the Amharic spelling for June, so the second full idea was revisited in June. Therefore, the answer is ሶኒ (June)."
እቶም ናይ “ፓናማ ወረቓቕቲ” ናብ መን ልሒኾም?,"The correct answer is **A: ናብ ትካል ሞሳክ ፎነሽካ**.

The passage states that the ""Panama Papers"" were documents from the law firm Mossack Fonseca. They were leaked *from* this firm. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ናብ ጋዜጣ** - The Guardian newspaper *reported* on the papers, but didn't receive the original documents.
* **C: ባንክ ዱተች** - Deutsche Bank was mentioned as a bank involved, but didn't receive the papers.
* **D: ናይ ኣይስላንድ መራሕቲ መንግስቲ** - The Icelandic leaders were *affected* by the papers, they didn't receive them.

Here's why:

* The text states that the documents reveal how banks helped wealthy individuals hide their money from taxes and other regulations. 
* It specifically mentions that Deutsche Bank is involved with a significant number of shell companies. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: እቲ ናይ ትካል ሕጊ ናይ ፓናማ:** The Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca facilitated the process, but they aren't the ones hiding the money.
* **C: ባንክ ዱተች:** While several banks are implicated, the text specifically highlights Deutsche Bank and doesn't focus on Dutch banks.
* **D: እቲ መንግስቲ ናይ ፓኪስታን:** The Pakistani government's leaders *resigned* as a result of the scandal, but they weren't the ones hiding the wealth.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ሓደጋታት ናይ ነፈርቲ ዝበዝሓ ሞት ዝነበረን ኣየኖት እዮም?,"The correct answer is **A: እታ ካብ ኢራን ናብ ኣርማንያ እንዳምርሐት ዝተጋጨወት ነፋሪት**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ኣብ ዝሓለፈ ወርሒ ናብ ኣርመንያ ዘምርሐት ኣውሮፕላን ድሕሪ ምውዳቓ ሂወት ናይ'ቶም 168 ተሳፈርቲ ዘጥፍአ ሓደጋ..."" This means the plane crash *to* Armenia resulted in the death of 168 passengers - the highest number of fatalities mentioned in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: እታ ዝተጋጨወት ናይ ፖሊስ ሄሌኮፕተር:**  This only resulted in 3 deaths and 3 injuries.
*   **C: እታ ካብ ኣርማንያ ናብ ኢራን እንዳኣምርሐት ዝተጋጨወት ነፋሪት:** The text describes a flight *from* Iran *to* Armenia, not the other way around.
*   **D: እቲ ናይ ነፋሪት ምሕምሻሽ ኣብ ማሻሃድ:** This resulted in 17 deaths, which is fewer than the 168 from the plane crash.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ዓለምለኻዊ ማዕቐባት ሓደሽቲ ኣውሮፕላናት ክግዝኣ ኣይኽእላን ማለት እዩ"" (This means international sanctions prevent them from buying new aircraft). This directly implies a lack of funds *because* of sanctions.
* The passage connects this inability to purchase new planes with frequent air accidents.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ዝኣረገ ጭፍራ ናይ ህዝብን ዉትህድርናን ነፈርቲ (High volume of civil and military aircraft)** - The passage doesn't suggest the *volume* of flights is the problem, but rather the age and condition of the aircraft.
* **C: ሓደስቲ ነፈርቲ ምግዛእ ዝኽልክል እገዳ (Embargoes preventing the purchase of new aircraft)** - While the passage mentions sanctions (which act as an embargo), the core issue is the *result* of the sanctions – the lack of funds to make purchases.  Option B gets at the root cause.
* **D: ድኹም ኣተሓሕዛ ዘለዎ ጭፍራ ናይ ነፈርቲ (Poorly maintained aircraft fleet)** - While poor maintenance could be a factor, the passage highlights the age of the fleet and the inability to *replace* them as the primary problem.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the review ""will fundamentally redefine"" Iraqi policy. This means the review is questioning and potentially changing the overall direction of policy, not just minor adjustments, strengthening alliances, or supporting American agreements.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣዋጅ ምስ ዉሑዳት ለዉጥታት፡ ኣብ ዒራቕ ዝዓቢ ዘሎ ጎነጽ ክዉገድ ከም ዝኽእል (Announcement with minor changes, potentially restricting aspects of the situation in Iraq):** The passage states it’s a *fundamental* redefinition, not minor changes.
* **C: ምኽርታት ንዶባት ናይ ዒራቕ ብምዉሓስ (Strengthening support for Iraqi governments):**  The passage focuses on protecting Iraq *from* hostile forces, not necessarily solely strengthening the government.
* **D: ምሕጽንታ ንናይ ኣሜሪካ ስምምዕ (Support for American agreements):** While the passage mentions US policy and potential negotiations, the core of the review is about Iraqi policy, not simply supporting US agreements.

Here's why:

The text states the following:

*   The Iraqi manufacturing group's 6 PM output was submitted.
*   It emphasizes the need to avoid actions that would escalate conflict or provoke retaliation.
*   It discusses the potential for policy reinterpretations and a significant policy shift.
*   It mentions the initiation of a new diplomatic offensive.

Option C, ""Strengthening confrontation"" directly contradicts the overall tone and stated goals of the document, which aim for de-escalation and diplomatic solutions.

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned in the text:

*   **A: መረጋገጺ ዝዉስኽ ዘሎ ጎነጽ ደዉ ንኽብል ኣዋጅ ክእወጅ (Issuing a decree to secure a credible buffer zone)** - While not explicitly stated, establishing security and protecting against external threats is implied.
*   **B: ቐጥታዊ ምቕያር ናይ ኣንፈት (Immediate policy change)** - The text directly mentions ""a significant change in approach.""
*   **D: ምምስራት ሓድሽ ዲፕሎማቲካ ተበግሶ (Launching a new diplomatic offensive)** - The text specifically says a new diplomatic offensive will be launched.

Therefore, **C** is the only option *not* mentioned or implied in the provided text."
ብመሰረት ፖሊስ፡ ከም ናይ ፕሮቨንዛኖ የማናይ-ኢድ ዝተሓስበ መን እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ሎ ፒኮሎ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ፖሊስ ከምዝበሎ ሎ ፒኮሎ ኣብ ፓሌርሞ ናይ ፕሮቬናዛኖ የማናይ ኢድ ስለዝነበረ..."" This directly translates to ""According to the police, Lo Picolo was Provenzano's right-hand man in Palermo...""

Therefore, the police considered Lo Picolo to be Provenzano's right-hand man.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""እቶም ሓላቑ ብፕሮቨንዛኖ ነዚ ብምኽንያት ሪና ዝመፀ ውግእ ኣንፃር እቲ ናይ ጂኦቫኒ ፋልኮንን ፓውሎ ቦረሰሊኖ ብ1992 ናይ ወንጀለኛታት ሂወት የእትወና እዩ ዝበለት ክልል ኣብ መውዳእታ ስለዘቐመጦ ኣብ መፈንጥራ ኣትዮ።""  This translates to ""Those who were acquitted by Provenzano, the attack that Riina led, which resulted in the deaths of Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992, found themselves in trouble because they stood in the way of this.""

This directly links Falcone's death to an attack *led by Totò Riina*.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ሂቶሺ ሳይቶ ኣብ 54 ዓመቱ ሞተ ። ምኽንያት ናይ'ቲ ሞት ኢንትራሄፓቲክ ባይል ዳክት ካንሰር ምዃኑ ተሓቢሩ። ብሰሉስ አብ ኦሳካ ሞይቱ እዩ። ብዘይካ ነበር ናይ ኦሎምፒክን ናይ ዓለምን ሻምፒዮን ምዃን፣ ሳይቶ ኣብ እዋነ ሞቱ፣ ሙሉእ ናይ ጃፓን ጁዶ ፌዴሬሽን ስልጠና ኮሚቴ አቦ-መንበር ኔሩ። (Hitoshi Saito died at the age of 54. The cause of death was reported to be intrahepatic bile duct cancer. He passed away in Osaka. Aside from being an Olympic and World champion, Saito was the chairman of the full Japan Judo Federation Training Committee at the time of his death.)

Let's look at the options:

* **A: ናይ ክልተ ዙር ናይ ዓለም ጎብለል (Two-time World Champion)** - The passage says he was a ""World Champion.""
* **B: ንኹሉ ናይ ጃፓን ጁዶ ፈደሬሽን ናይ ኮሚተ ኣቦ ወንበር (Chairman of the Japan Judo Federation Committee)** - The passage specifically states this.
* **C: ናይ ክልተ ዙር ናይ ኦለምፒክ ተዓዋቲ ወርቒ ሜዳልያ (Two-time Olympic Gold Medalist)** - The passage says he was an ""Olympic champion"" (implying at least one gold, and potentially more - the word ክልተ 'two' isn't mentioned in the text).
* **D: ክኢላ ጁዶ (Kila Judo)** - This isn't mentioned anywhere in the text and appears to be a distractor. It's not a known honor or achievement of Hitoshi Saito.

Therefore, **D** is the only option that doesn’t correspond to something stated about Hitoshi Saito in the provided text."
ኢዋሳኪ ማሕላ ካብ ምዉሳድ ኣበይ ከወግድ ክኢሉ?,"The correct answer is **B: ኔፓል**.

Here's why:

The passage states ኢውሳኪ ""ካብ መርዓ ኣምሊጡ"" (escaped from marriage) in ኔፓል. This implies a strong connection to ኔፓል and a reason to seek refuge there. The question asks where ኢውሳኪ might seek asylum, making ኔፓል the most logical choice.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **ጃፓን:** No mention of any connection to Japan.
*   **ህንዲ:** While ኢውሳኪ was imprisoned in India, this doesn't necessarily mean they would seek asylum there.
*   **ቲበት:** ኢውሳኪ was held captive in Tibet, not free to seek asylum there."
ንኢዋሳኪ መን ኣጥቒዕዎ?,"The correct answer is **A: በዓል-ቤቱ (Her husband)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ኢዋሳኪ was *married* (ካብ መርዓ ኣምሊጡ) and then *arrested in India* (ኣብ ህንዲ እውን ተኣሲሩ ነይሩ እዩ).  This strongly suggests her husband is the one who ""caught"" or ""apprehended"" her, leading to her arrest.  The other options are elements of her journey, but don't explain who ultimately brought her into custody.

* **B: ሸፋቱ ባሕሪ (Sea robbers)** - They robbed her, but didn't ""catch"" her in the sense the question asks.
* **C: ከልቢ (Prisoners)** - She was held *by* prisoners, but they didn't initiate the capture.
* **D: ፖሊስ (Police)** -  The police *arrested* her, but the passage implies her husband was involved in leading to that arrest.

ኣሎንሶ ቕድድሙ መዓስ ዛዚሙ?,"The correct answer is **A: ሽሁማቸር ናይ ቅድሚት ጎማኡ ድሕሪ ምዕናዉ**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""ማይክል ሹማቸር ኣብቲ ቕድድም ኣብ እተገብረ ሓያላት ውግኣት ጉድኣት ስለ ዘጋጠሞ ድሕሪ ኣሎንሶ ነዊሕ ከይጸንሐ ጉይኡ ዛዘመ."" This translates to ""Michael Schumacher had difficulties in the front during intense fighting, so Alonso didn't last long after him."" This clearly indicates Alonso lost the lead *after* Schumacher encountered problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ፊሽቸላ ቑጽጽር ናይ መኪናኡ ኣጥፊኡ** - This explains why Fisichella dropped out of the race, but doesn't relate to Alonso losing the lead.
* **C: ሽሁማቸር ድሕሪ ናይ ገዛእ ርእሱ ቕድድም ምዝዛሙ** - The text doesn't say Schumacher lost the lead himself.
* **D: ቅድሚ ምምርሑ** - The text explains Alonso lost the lead *during* the race, not before he started leading.



"
ሽሁማቸር ቕድድሙ ቐልጢፉ ንኽዝም ዝገበሮ እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ምግጫዉ ምስ ኣሎንሶ (His clash with Alonso)**.

Here's why:

The text states ""ኣብቲ ቕድድም ኣብ እተገብረ ሓያላት ውግኣት ጉድኣት ስለ ዘጋጠሞ ድሕሪ ኣሎንሶ ነዊሕ ከይጸንሐ ጉይኡ ዛዘመ"" which translates to ""Because he was involved in fierce battles at the front and had an incident, he didn't last long after Alonso.""  This clearly indicates Schumacher's early exit was due to a collision or clash with Alonso.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ናይ መኪኑኡ ቑጽጽር ኣጥፊኡ (His car's gearbox failed)** - The text doesn't mention a gearbox issue for Schumacher.
*   **C: ምዕናዉ ጎማ ብፊሽቸላ (His tire was punctured by Fisichella)** - The text mentions Fisichella withdrawing *before* the race, not causing Schumacher trouble.
*   **D: ዕንወት ናይታ መኪና ሞላ (His car's engine stalled)** - No engine issues are mentioned for Schumacher.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...a temporary order repeatedly issued against the agency by Judge Gleyn was approved..."" and ""...the arrestees were detained for more than 24 hours without a hearing by the Judicial Commission."" This means Judge Gleyn approved the order that allowed for the detention of the over 80 prisoners.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: እቲ ዝኣሰረ ፖሊስ (The arresting police):** The text doesn't say the police were responsible for the continued detention, only that arrests occurred.
*   **C: እቲ ማእከላይ መመዝገቢ ማእከል (The central prison center):**  The central prison is where the prisoners *were*, but didn't *order* the detention.
*   **D: እቲ ናይ ቤት-ፍርዲ ኣባል ሽማግለ (The court bailiff):** The bailiff likely carries out orders, but doesn't *issue* them."

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ብዳኛ ግሌይን ተዋሂቡ ነይሩ። (were approved by Judge Gleyn)"" referring to the temporary order holding them for over 24 hours. This implies they need an official warrant approved by Judge Gleyn to be held. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ዋሕስ (Rights):** While they have rights, the text doesn't say a hearing *is* their requirement for being held. It states they *didn't have* a hearing.
*   **B: ምስቲ ዝኣሰሮም ሓለቃ ፖሊስ ኣኼባ (Meeting with the arresting police officer):** The text doesn't mention a meeting being a requirement.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""diplomats have pointed out that the network is not considered important in the Afghan constitution."" This directly means the reason for dismantling the network is its conflict with the Afghan constitution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሓደጋታት ጸጥታ (Security threats)** - While the passage mentions addressing security challenges, it doesn't state this is *the* reason for dismantling the network. It's a broader goal.
*   **C: ልዑል ወጻኢታት (High costs)** - The passage does not mention any costs associated with the network.
*   **D: ሕገ መንግስታዊ ዘይንጹርነት (Unconstitutionality)** - This is related to the correct answer but is a description of the *result* of conflicting with the constitution, not the direct reason. The reason *is* the conflict with the constitution itself.

Here's why:

The passage states that diplomats found something in the Afghan constitution that *suggests the election is not valid*. This directly translates to the election being unconstitutional or lacking a basis in the constitution. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣንጻር ሕገ መንግስቲ እዩ ነይሩ** - While related, the passage doesn't say the diplomats *opposed* the constitution, but rather found something *within* it that questioned the election's legitimacy.
*   **B: ጸጥታዊ ሓደጋታት ነይሩ** - The passage mentions security concerns as a reason for wanting to postpone/cancel the election, but doesn’t state this is the diplomats' reasoning.
*   **D: እቲ መረጻ ኣዝዩ ክቡር እዩ ነይሩ** - This is the opposite of what the passage implies. The diplomats were finding reasons *against* the election's validity.

ንፋታ ፍርዳዊ ኣገልግሎት ዝህብ መን እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ወኪላት ፖለቲካ (Political Agents)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that ""Political Agents"" are responsible for providing services to governments and judicial bodies under Article 247 of the Pakistani constitution.  The passage describes them as functioning in place of a full presidential government in certain areas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: መንግስቲ ፓኪስታን (Pakistani Government)** - While ultimately responsible, the text specifies the Political Agents *act* on behalf of the government in this specific context.
*   **C: ፕረዚደንት ፓኪስታን (President of Pakistan)** - The text indicates the Political Agents are functioning *instead* of a full presidential government.
*   **D: መንግስቲ እንግሊዝ (British Government)** - Pakistan gained independence from British rule in 1947, so the British government is not involved.

This clearly indicates they *provide services*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ብፕረዚደንት ፓኪስታን ዝተመርጹ እዮም:** The passage states the President *appoints* them, not that they are elected *by* the President.
* **C: ንሕገ መንግስቲ ፓኪስታን ይኽተሉ:** The passage states they operate *under* the constitution, not that they interpret or change it.

The text states Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone starred in the film, and it lists ""ተዋሳአይን ብሉጽ ተዋሳኢትን"" (actors and a nominated actress) as award categories.  Therefore, Emma Stone was nominated as an actress."
እታ ፊልም ንኣየናይ ሽልማት እያ ዘይተሓጸየት?,"The correct answer is **B: ብሉጽ ስእላዊ ክእለት**.

Here's why:

The text lists several categories the film was nominated for: ""ብሉጽ ስእሊ, ዳይሬክተር, ሲኒማቶግራፊ..."" and then specifically mentions ""ብሉጽ ኦርጂናል ደርፍታት"".  It then states the film received 26 nominations from Lionsgate.  The question asks what the film *didn't* receive a nomination for.  ""ብሉጽ ስእላዊ ክእለት"" is not listed among the nominations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ብሉጽ ስእሊ** - The text clearly states it *was* nominated for this.
* **C: ብሉጽ ምትሕውዋስ ድምጺ** - While not explicitly mentioned as a win, it's included in the list of categories nominated.
* **D: ብሉጽ ኦርጂናል ደርፊ** - The text specifically says it was nominated for ""ብሉጻት ኦርጂናል ደርፍታት.""

Here's why:

The text specifically states that Units 1 and 2 at the Shika Nuclear Power Plant (located in Hokuriku) were stopped. This indicates a direct operational change *because* of the earthquake.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ ኢሺካዋ ዝርከብ መዓርፎ ነፈርቲ (Noto Airport in Ishikawa)** - The airport was *suspended* (meaning temporarily halted), not stopped from functioning entirely and indefinitely. The text states it was ""being suspended"".
* **C: ኩሉ ናይ ባቡር ኣገልግሎት (All train services)** - While some train services were disrupted, the text says services were ""halted in affected areas"" - not all of them.
* **D: ኣብ ኒጋታ ዝርከብ ትካል መመንጨዊ ሓይሊ ኤሌክትሪክ (Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata)** - The text says Kashiwazaki-Kariwa was *already* operating, and there's no indication it was stopped *because* of the earthquake. It confirms it wasn't damaged by the quake.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ገለ ኣባይቲ (Some rubble)** - While landslides *create* rubble, the text doesn't directly state rubble itself caused the issues.
*   **B: ኣብ ፋብሪካ ሺካ ክልተ ሪኣክተራት (Two reactors at the Shika plant)** - The text mentions the reactors were being inspected but doesn't link them to being damaged by the earthquake.
*   **D: መዓርፎ ነፈርቲ ኖቶ (Noto Airport runway)** - The text says the airport was closed, not that the runway was damaged.

Here's why:

The text specifically states the document concerns the issue of ""the non-acceptance of Dobat"" (presumably referring to territories) and whether Palestine had Dobat prior to the 1967 war. It also mentions Jerusalem as a holy site and the continuation of Israeli military presence.  Therefore:

* **A: መጻኢ ዕድል ኢየሩሳሌም (The future of Jerusalem)** -  The document *does* address Jerusalem.
* **C: ህላወ ወተሃደራት ኣብቲ ጎልጎል (Military presence in the West Bank)** - The document *does* mention the continuation of Israeli military presence.

* **B: ጠንቂ ኲናት 1967 (The cause of the 1967 war)** - The document focuses on the *outcome* of the 1967 war (territories before/after) but *doesn't* discuss the *cause* of the war itself.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ሓደ ኻብቲ ፍልስጤም ዝሓተተቶ ነገር ዘይኰነ ኣየናይ ኢዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ቀጻሊ ወተሃደራዊ ህላወ ኣብ ጎልጎል ዮርዳኖስ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Israel agreed to a ten-year continuation of the military presence within the territory, but the PA took the agreement to be for five years."" This means the continued military presence in the West Bank (which includes parts of the Jordan Valley) was *imposed by Israel* as part of the agreement. It wasn't something Palestine initiated or took from Israel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ቅድሚ ውግእ ኣብ ዝነበረ ዅነታት እተመርኰሰ ዶባት** - The passage *specifically* states Palestine had territories before the 1967 war.  This is something Palestine *had*.
* **C: ብዛዕባ መጻኢ ዕድል ኢየሩሳሌም ዝምልከት መልስታት** - The passage mentions the document addresses Jerusalem, indicating Palestine had concerns/positions related to it.
* **D: ናይ ሓሙሽተ ዓመት ወተሃደራዊ ህላወ ኣብ ጎልጎል ዮርዳኖስ** -  While the passage states the PA *interpreted* the agreement as five years, it was originally a ten-year agreement *from Israel's side*. The PA taking the agreement doesn't mean they ""took"" the military presence itself.

ማ ኣብ ኣየነይቲ ሃገር እያ ሕጊ ተማሂራ?,"The correct answer is **A: ኣሜሪካ**.

The text states that ማ (Ma) studied at New York University and Harvard Law School, both of which are in the United States (ኣሜሪካ). Therefore, ማ studied law in the USA."

Here's why:

The passage states that despite his achievements and background, Ma ""could easily navigate a sensitive path of connection with mainland China."" This implies that having a connection to mainland China is strategically advantageous for Ma in relation to his political ambitions. The question asks which country helps Ma with his electoral success, and the text points to China being that country.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣሜሪካ (America):** While Ma studied and had a green card in the US, the passage emphasizes his ability to connect with *China*.
*   **B: ሆንግ ኮንግ (Hong Kong):**  He was born there, but the passage focuses on his broader political maneuvering.
*   **C: ዓባይ ብሪጣንያ (Great Britain):** There is no mention of Britain’s role in Ma’s political career within the given text."

This translates to ""Many of the participating families mentioned that Carolyn Wilson, an employee of the Oakland housing authority,...""  Since the meeting was held at the East Bay Community Law Center and the families were discussing their issues with the Oakland housing authority, it's logical to conclude she worked *at* the Law Center, assisting those families.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: ፖሊስ ኦክላንድ (Oakland Police)** - The text doesn't mention her working for the police.
* **C: እቲ ኦኤችኤ (OHA)** - She is described as an employee *of* the OHA, but not working *at* the OHA. The text also states she *left* the city, implying she no longer worked for the OHA.
* **D: ሎክዉድ ጋርደንስ (Lockwood Gardens)** - This is the housing complex where the families live, not her place of employment.

The text states: ""...Hamlin was third with ten points behind, but was seven points ahead of Bauer."" This means Bauer is in fourth place. 

Let's break down the rankings as described in the text:

1.  Kaslovski (2,250 points)
2.  Johnson (2,243 points)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn’t state they all fell during a November meteor shower. It mentions 15 were found in November, but doesn't claim that all Martian meteorites are from that shower.
*   **B:** While 24,000 is mentioned, it’s the *total* number of meteorites, not the number confirmed to be from Mars.
*   **C:** The passage states the price range *compared* to gold, but doesn’t say they are worth more than $11,000.

* **A: ድሕሪ ውድቀት ፈሊፐ ማሳ (After Felipe Massa's accident)** - Massa's accident happened in 2009, well after Schumacher's retirement.

* **D: ኣብ መወዳእታ ናይ 2009 ዓመተ ስፖርት (At the end of the 2009 sports year)** - Schumacher retired in 2006, not 2009.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The text mentions his championship aspirations *after* the injury, not during.
* **C:** Schumacher's retirement is the context *for* Massa needing to replace him, not *when* Massa was injured.
* **D:** The injury happened during a specific event (the Grand Prix), not generally ""before 2009"".

Here's why:

This means the passage is concerned with AOL being competitive with Yahoo! and Microsoft in terms of user base.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ቁጽሪ ተጠቀምቲ ኤ.ኦ.ኤል ክውስኽ ይኽእል** - The passage doesn't say AOL's user base *will* grow, only that it's becoming comparable to others.
*   **B: ኤ.ኦ.ኤል ዕዳጋ ኣይ.ኤም ዘማዕበለ እንኮ ትካል ክኸውን እዩ** - While the passage mentions AOL being owned by AIM, it doesn't focus on this as the main concern.
*   **D: ድሕሪ ደጊም ኤ.ኦ.ኤል ኣብ ኣሜሪካ ኣብ ጥቕሚ ኣይክውዕልን እዩ** - The passage doesn't suggest AOL will lose value, but rather that its freedom/independence is at risk.

Here's why:

The passage states that AOL's control over its IM network is a reason to be concerned, and this independence *could* be lost with the merger. The concern is specifically about AOL's freedom to innovate and improve its services at its own pace.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሰፊሕ ምዕባለ ኢንተርነት ኣብ ኣሜሪካ** - While related to the topic, the passage doesn't directly discuss broad internet access.
*   **B: ዕዳጋ ኣይ.ኤም ምጥቃም** - The passage mentions IM usage, but it's not the core issue of potential loss.
*   **D: ሽርክነት ያሁን ማይክሮሶፍትን** -  The passage notes Yahoo! and Microsoft's declining user bases *compared* to AOL, but the partnership itself isn't the danger. The danger lies in the potential loss of AOL's independence."
ኣብቲ መጥቃዕቲ ካብ ዝሞቱ ኽንደይ ዝኣኽሉ ሰባት እዮም ኣባላት ፖሊስ ዘይኮኑ?,"The correct answer is **A: 19**.

Here's why:

The text states that ""over twenty"" people were injured, and ""nine of the injured were police officers."" This implies that the remaining injured individuals were *not* police officers. To find the number of non-police injured, we subtract the number of injured police officers from the total number of injured: 20 (over twenty rounds to 20) - 9 = 11.

However, the text specifically says the attack *killed* over twenty people, and nine of those killed were police. Therefore, the number of non-police killed would be the total killed minus the police killed. As we only know the number of *injured* police, we must use the number injured to derive the number killed from the statement 'over twenty' = 20.

Therefore 20 - 9 = 19.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 32 ካብ ልኡኻት እታ ግዝኣት** - This refers to Gingrich's percentage, not what Romney received.
*   **B: ሕጹይነት ሪፓብሊካን ፓርቲ** - This is a consequence of Romney's win, not what he won *specifically* from Florida.

The passage states that Perry said he was returning to Texas ""to reassess"" after the results, but *also* confirmed he would not be dropping out of the race and would compete in the South Carolina primary. This shows he was uncertain and reassessing, not definitively conceding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ጊንግሪች** - The passage says Gingrich *congratulated* Santorum, indicating acceptance of the results.
*   **B: ባችማን** - Bachmann decided to ""reconsider her involvement in the presidential race,"" which implies she was thinking about quitting.
*   **D: ሮምኒ** - Romney was criticized *by* Gingrich, not shown as uncertain about the results.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gingrich...accused Romney of running a negative campaign because of what he called misleading attack ads."" This directly indicates Gingrich criticized Romney based on the election results.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ባችማን** - The passage says Bachmann considered dropping out of the race, but doesn't mention being criticized by anyone based on the Iowa results.
* **B: ጊንግሪች** - Gingrich is the one *doing* the accusing, not the recipient of it.
* **D: ፔሪ** - Perry announced he was returning to Texas, but wasn't the target of criticism related to the Iowa results.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኢስት ቴክሳስ** - The text mentions East Texas as a place the show *gained* audiences, not where it originally aired.
* **C: ሬድዮ ኣስትሮኔት** - Radio Astronet was created as a subsection of Toginet in 2015, *after* the show started.

The text states: ""ኣብቲ ምሸት ኦቬችኪን ዝገበራ ናይ መጀመርታ ቅብሊት፣ ሮኪ ኒኮላስ ባክቶርም ዘቑፀራ መዐወቲት ሽቶ ነይራ፡፡"" This translates to ""In the evening Ovechkin scored the first goal, followed by Nicholas Backstrom's tying goal."" 

While Backstrom *tied* the game, Ovechkin *scored* the first goal, making him the goal scorer mentioned in the text. The question asks who scored *the* goal, not who tied it."
ኣብዚ ዓመተ ስፖርት ኣብ ጸወታ ካፒታልስ ኣንጻር ትራሸርስ መበል 60 ሸቶኡ ዘመዝገበ መን እዩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ኣሌክስ ኦቨችኪን**.

The text states: ""ሎሚ ምሸት ዘቑፀራ ካልኣይቲ ሽትኡ አብዚ ዓመት መበል 60 እያ፣ እዚ ድማ ድሕሪ 1995-1996 ዓመት ጃቶሚር ጃግርን ማርዮ ሌመይክስን ዝተባሃሉ ክልተ ተፃወቲ ነፍሰወከፎም አብዚ ብርኪ ዓወት ድሕሪ ምብጻሖም እብዚ ዓመት ልዕሊ 60 ሽቶታት ዘቁጸረ ናይ መጀመሪያ ተፃዋታይ ኮይኑ ኣሎ።""

This means Alex Ovechkin is the first player to score over 60 goals in a season since Jaromir Jagr and Mario Lemieux in 1995-1996. Therefore, he is the one who reached 60 goals in the Capitals vs. Thrashers game this sports year.

The text states ""ሰሜናዊ ከውሒ አብ 2007 ብዝነበረ ናይ ነብረት ውሕስና ስለዘጋልፅ ድጋፍ የድሊ እዩ."" (Northern Rock needed support due to the mortgage crisis of 2007). This directly links the bank needing support to the mortgage crisis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: እቲ ባንኪ መንግስታዊ ምስተገብረ** - The text states it became nationalized in 2008, *after* needing support.
*   **B: እቲ ባንኪ ካብቲ ንብረት ምሕደራ ኩባንያ ምስ ተፈንጨለ** - The text doesn't say the need for support was related to being split from a property management company.
*   **C: ድሕሪ ጉጅለ ቨርጅን ነቲ ባንክ ምዕዳጉ** - Virgin's bid was rejected *before* the bank was nationalized; it wasn’t after a takeover attempt.

* This means Virgin Group made a bid to help the bank *before* it was nationalized, and the text identifies that as a time of financial difficulty (""ህፁፅ ድሃግ"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ቨርጅን ግሩፕ ንናይ ኖርዘርን ሮክ ናይ ንብረት ምሕደራ ኩባንያ’ውን ዓዲጉ:** The text specifically says, ""ቨርጅን ናይ ሰሜን ሮክ ‹ጉድ ባንክ› ጥራይ እምበር ናይ ንብረት ምምሕድዳር ኩባንያ ኣይገዝኣቶን."" (Virgin didn't own a property management company.)
* **B: ቨርጅን ግሩፕ ነቲ ባንክ መንግስታዊ ድሕሪ ምዃኑ’ዩ ዓዲጉዎ:** The text states Virgin made a bid *before* nationalization, not after.

Therefore, America is the country described as benefiting from the Kyoto agreement being withdrawn from."

The passage explicitly states the Australian government was concerned about ratifying the Kyoto Protocol because of ""ነዚ ክዮቶ ስምምዕ ከይፀድቕ ነፂግዎ ይኹን እምበር በዓል ህንድን ቻይናን ሃገራት ኣብቲ ናይ ምምራትን ምልኣኽን ኣይተኻተታን.""  This translates to ""they would rather not ratify this Kyoto agreement because countries like India and China were not involved in leading and bearing the burden.""  The underlying concern is the economic impact on Australia if they adhered to the agreement while major economic competitors did not.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣሜሪካ (America):** While the passage mentions the US as a non-ratifying country, it doesn't explain *why* Australia considered not ratifying.
*   **C: ሰደድ ፈሓም (Slow development):** This isn't mentioned as a reason in the passage.
*   **D: ኣብ ዕላማታት ልቀት ትኪ እታ ሃገር (The country's emission targets):**  The passage doesn't focus on the targets themselves, but rather the economic implications.

The passage states: ""...ብቑዓት ወለንተኛታት ኣብ ትሕቲ ናይቲ ናይ ስፖርታውያን ተኮስቲ ማሕበር ናይ ሃድን መደብ ተቖጺሮም።"" This directly translates to ""qualified volunteers were organized under the NSW Sport and Recreation's order.""  This indicates the shooters were categorized under this order.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ናይ ኣውስትራልያ ናይ ስፖርታውያን ተኮስቲ ማሕበር መደብ** - The passage mentions this association but doesn't state the shooters were *specifically* categorized under it.
*   **B: መደብ ዕቃበን ቅርስታትን ፓርክን** - This isn't mentioned in the context of the shooters' classification.
*   **C: መደብ ኤን.ፒ.ደብሊዩ.ኤስ** - While NPWS is involved in the overall operation, the passage specifies the shooters are under the NSW Sport and Recreation order."

(Regarding the shooters who were in the qualifying test, it was found that the test wasn't properly conducted and was therefore reviewed by the Rangers...) This directly indicates the test itself was flawed and needed review.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ተኳሲት ናይ ልምምድ መምርሒ ተዋሂብዎም (Shooters were given training guidelines):** The passage says they *received* training guidelines, not that this was the issue with the test.
* **C: ሬንጀርስ ነቶም ተኮስቲ ይቆጻጸርዎም ነበሩ (Rangers were monitoring the shooters):** The passage mentions Rangers reviewing the test *because* it was poorly conducted, not that monitoring was the problem.

Here's why:

The passage states the breakdown is ""as determined by molecular assessment"".  The question asks *where* the breakdown is reached, and the text specifically identifies it as being reached through molecular assessment. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብ ሪፍት ቫሊ (in Rift Valley)** - While the researcher is *from* the Rift Valley, the breakdown itself isn't located there.
* **B: ኣብ ቅሪተ-ኣካል (in body parts)** - The passage talks about a general breakdown, not specifically in body parts.
* **D: ኣብ ኢትዮጵያ (in Ethiopia)** - Similar to Rift Valley, Ethiopia is where the researcher is based, but not where the breakdown happens.

Here's why:

* The passage states the researcher was discussing the ""molekulär märt`o"" (molecular interaction) being the governing principle. The researcher explains that this means ""everything must return to how it was.""
* The question asks what the researcher is observing. The passage specifically links the researcher's statements to the study of these molecular interactions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ርኽበት ናይቲ ቅሪተ-ኣካላት (Preservation of remains):** While related to the study, it's not what the researcher directly discusses as the governing principle.
* **B: እቲ ምፍልላይ (The separation):** The passage doesn't focus on separation, but rather the return to a previous state.
* **D: ኣብ ሪፍት ቫሊ ዝተገብረ መጽናዕቲ (Research conducted in the Rift Valley):** This refers to the *location* of the research, not the subject of the study itself."

*   **A: ናይ’ቲ ተቖጻጻሪ ሴንሰራት ኣብ ጥቓ’ቲ ኮንሶል ከም ዘለዉ ኣረጋግጽ:** While the passage mentions sensors, ensuring they are on the console isn't what *the player* does to control movement.

Here's why:

The passage states the device ""used two sensors at the edge of the TV to resemble a television remote control."" This directly links the sensors to the remote control appearance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: እቲ ናይ ኒንቴንዶ ሪቮሉሽን መቖጻጻሪ** - This refers to the whole device, not *what* makes it resemble a remote.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ሓንቲ ኣውሮፕላን ብፈንጂ ምስ ኣፈራርሑዋ..."" (one plane was brought down with explosives). This directly relates to the plane carrying bombs.
* The question asks about what the plane was carrying, based on the news report.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: እታ ነፋሪት ኣብ ኡሩምኪ እያ ዓሊባ (The plane was landing in Urumqi):**  While the passage mentions Urumqi, it doesn't say this was the plane's destination. It says the plane *turned back* from Urumqi.
* **C: እታ ነፋሪት ናብ ኣፍጋኒስታን ተሰጋጊራ (The plane headed to Afghanistan):** It did eventually *end up* in Afghanistan, but it was forced to land in Kandahar after being damaged.

Here's why:

The passage states ""ሓንቲ ኣውሮፕላን ብፈንጂ ምስ ኣፈራርሑዋ..."" (one plane was destroyed by an explosion...). This directly indicates the plane crashed. The other options are not explicitly stated in the text:

* **B:** There's no mention of the plane being unable to land.
* **C:** The plane *did* head towards Afghanistan, it didn't stray from its path.
* **D:** The passage says it *was* blown up, not that it detonated a bomb itself.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that Sara Danius discussed the committee's attempts to reach Bob Dylan and the challenges they faced in contacting him regarding the 2016 Nobel Prize. She mentioned they were trying to decide on a strategy for reaching out to him.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ተዓዋቲ ሽልማት ኖቤል ስነ-ጽሑፍ** - While the conversation is *about* the Nobel Prize, she doesn't discuss the merits of the prize itself.
*   **B: እቲ ኮሚቴ ካብ ተሓባበርቲ ዝኾነ ይኹን መልሲ ኣይረኸበን** - She actually says she *received* a response (""ደስ ዝብል ግብረ መልሲ ሰዲድለይ ኣሎ"") but found it unhelpful.
*   **C: ሕጹያት ሽልማት ኖቤል ስነ-ጽሑፍ 2016** - The text focuses on the difficulties in *contacting* Dylan, not the urgency of the prize itself.



"
ክርከብ ዘይተከኣለ መን እዩ?,"The correct answer is **D: Bob Dylan**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Nobel Committee was unable to directly reach Bob Dylan to inform him of his 2016 prize. Sara Danius explains they had to send an email and received a ""positive response.""  This indicates the difficulty in contacting *him*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bob Dylan's close associate** - The passage doesn't mention any associate.
* **B: Sara Danius** - She is the one *reporting* the difficulty, not the one being unreachable.
* **C: Swedish Academy** - The Academy is the one *trying* to reach Dylan, not the one being unreachable.

ስላንያ ንዝተፈላለዩ ሃገራት ክንደይ ማሕተም ኣፍረየት?,"The correct answer is **D: ልዕሊ 1000**

The text states: ""ንስዊድንን ካልኦት 28 ሀገራት ልዕሊ 1000 ዝኸውን ማሕተም ሰሪሑ፡፡"" which translates to ""He created over 1000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries."""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: እቲ ካልኣይ ደረጃ መዕቆሪ ቦታ ክሳብ ዓቕሙ ይምላእ ኣሎ** - (The secondary containment zone is filling to capacity) This doesn't explain a potential leak, it describes the containment *of* a leak.
*   **B: ስሩዕ ፈተና ስርዓት መጥፍኢ ሓዊ** - (Fail-safe system test of the control system) This *caused* the initial spill, but isn't a continuing source of leakage.
*   **D: ኣብ ሓንቲ ካብተን ኣብ ፎርት ግሪሊ ዝርከባ ፓምፕ ጣብያታት ባርዕ ሓዊ** - (At one of the control valve pump stations in Fort Greely) This isn't mentioned as a source of potential ongoing leakage.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ሓዊ - ትእዛዝ ሲስተም ሙከራ ብዘስዓቦ ናይ ሓይሊ ምቁሩራጽ ኣብ መቆጻጸሪ 9 ናይ ድፍድፍ ዘይቲ መቆጻጸሪ ስለዝኸፈቶ እቲ ድፍድፍ ዘይቲ ፈሲሱ"" which translates to ""Because a power-fluctuation test of the early warning system caused the failure of compressor 9, the crude oil was released.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text mentions residual vapor *after* the spill, not as the cause of the compressor failure.
*   **C:** The tanks didn't overflow; a compressor failed, causing the spill.
*   **D:** The secondary containment area wasn't the cause of the problem, it was designed to *contain* the spill.

The passage states: ""ናይንዝ ዋርድ ኣብ እዋን ህቦብላ ካትሪና ክሳብ 20 ጫማ ዝበፅሕ ማዕበል ዝሃረማ"". This directly translates to ""During Hurricane Katrina, the water in the Ninth Ward rose to a height of 20 feet"". Therefore, the water level in the Ninth Ward was 20 feet high.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ናይንዝ ዋርድ ኣብ እዋን ህቦብላ ካትሪና ክሳብ 20 ጫማ ዝበፅሕ ማዕበል ዝሃረማ"" which translates to ""Ninth Ward during Hurricane Katrina experienced floods up to 20 feet high.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: እቲ ማይ ውሕጅ ስፍሓቱ 100 ጫማ እዩ ነይሩዎ (The water level reached 100 feet)** - The passage states water *flowed* from 100 feet away, not that the water level *reached* 100 feet.
*   **B: ክሳብ ሽንጢ ዝበጽሕ ማይ ኣብ ልዕሊ ዲጋ ኮይኑ (Water up to a meter high was above the dam)** - The passage doesn't mention water over a meter high or a dam.
*   **D: እቲ 6 ኢንች ዝዘነበ ዝናብ ነቲ ዝተበላሸወ ዲጋ ሰቢሩ (The 6-inch rain penetrated the damaged dam)** - The passage talks about the rain *contributing* to the flooding, but not specifically penetrating a dam. The key issue was the height of the floodwater.

* **The passage states:** ""እቲ ሕሙም ኣብ ሓደ ሓደ ናይ ኢቦላ ቫይረስ ዝተርኣየለን ከባብታት ናይጄሪያ ከይዱ ኔሩ"" (The patient had not been to any of the areas in Nigeria where Ebola virus cases had been seen). This tells us the patient *didn't* travel to known Ebola areas, but doesn't tell us *where* they *did* travel.
* **The passage confirms:**
    * **B:** The hospital is isolating patients to prevent spread (implying concern about potential transmission).
    * **C:** The hospital *is* using a protocol for containment.
    * **D:** Hamilton confirmed the patient was in stable condition.

Therefore, the only information *not* confirmed by the passage is the patient's travel history.

Here's why:

The passage states that researchers are trying to understand ""how the Earth was formed, especially how comets may have impacted Earth many years ago."" This directly corresponds to wanting to know *how the Earth was formed*.  The other options are related, but not the primary focus of the research described.

* **A** is a detail *about* the research, not what they want to find out.
* **B** and **C** are background information related to the possibility of comets bringing the building blocks of life, but the main question is about Earth's formation.

This directly indicates the police were involved in guiding traffic to alternate routes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኤፍ.ቢ.ኣይ ነቲ ምዕጻው ንክገብሮ ኣተሓሳሲቦም** (FBI planned the redirection) - The passage says the FBI *influenced* the Maryland Transport Authority's plan, it doesn't say they planned the redirection itself.

The passage states ""ካብቲ ከተማ ውፅእ ኢልካ ዝርከብ መማረፂ መንገዲ ዝተነገረ ከቢድ ናይ ተሽከርከርቲ ፍሰት ምዝንጋዕ ዝተወሃበ ጸብጻብ ኣይነበረን"" - which translates to ""There was no provided coordination to handle the heavy flow of vehicles on the exit road from the city"". This directly implies they faced a heavy flow of traffic during the interchange.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ተዓጽዮም ነይሮም** (They were delayed) - The passage doesn't mention delays.
*   **B: ከም መዘናግዒ ዀይኖም የገልግሉ ነይሮም** (They were serving as guides) - The passage doesn't mention anyone acting as guides.
*   **C: ንመራሕቲ መካይን ክፉታት ነይረን** (They were problems for local leaders) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.

This translates to: ""News website TMZ, the driver pulled over to the side of Sepulveda Boulevard, made a U-turn across traffic to take a photo of the police, and this could lead to the California Highway Patrol issuing two tickets.""

This clearly indicates the driver was ordered to pull over by the Highway Patrol *before* the incident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The driver *did* pull over to Sepulveda Boulevard, but this was after being instructed to by the patrol, not something that happened before.
*   **C:** The driver took a photo *of* the police, not a photo at the police's request.
*   **D:** The text doesn't mention the driver being able to photograph Bieber.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: መኪንኡ ኣብ ሴፑልቬዳ ቦውለቫርድ ደው የብል** (He pulled his car over on Sepulveda Boulevard) - While he *was* on Sepulveda Boulevard, the text says he pulled over as a *pedestrian*, not in a car.
*   **C: ጽዑቕ ጽርግያ ይሰግር** (He was walking a small dog) - There is no mention of a dog in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ጎሮሮኡ ቃንዛ ኣለዎ (His fever is severe):** The passage says he's *coming out of* a fever, not that it's severe.
* **C: ኣብ ዝተረጋገአ ኩነታት’ዩ ዘሎ (He is in a stable condition):** While likely true, the passage focuses on his *spirits* rather than his medical stability.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Today afternoon, winds were around 83 km/h, and were forecast to continue to decrease."" This directly indicates that the cyclone is *expected* to continue weakening after reaching that wind speed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ቅድሚ ናብ ማልዲቭስ ምብጽሑ** - The text doesn't mention a forecast related to before reaching the Maldives.
*   **C: ኣብ ዝለዓለ ጥርዙ ቅድሚ ምብጽሑ** -  The passage doesn't specify the highest intensity before landfall, just the current state and forecast.
*   **D: ቅድሚ ኣብ ሰዓት 149 ማይልስ ዝዓቐኑ ንፋስ ምብጽሑ** - The 149 mph wind speed is a *past* intensity, not a forecast for future weakening. The text focuses on what's happening *now* (83 km/h winds) and the *expectation* for *further* decrease.

Here's why:

The text states the cyclone reached sustained winds of 240 km/h (149 miles/h). While the text *also* mentions 83 km/h winds later, the question asks about the strongest winds *at the peak* of the cyclone.  Option A correctly states the peak wind speed in kilometers per hour.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **D: ብተፈጥሮ ዝኽሰት እዩ (Is naturally occurring):** The passage *does* say it's naturally occurring, but this isn't what distinguishes it as a *Karenia brevis* red tide.  The key identifying factor is that it *is* a type of algae.

The text explicitly states: ""ዛጊድ ዘጋጠመ ጉድኣት ወይ ውሑጅ ኣይተጸብጸበን"" which translates to ""No landslides or floods were reported."" This means floods (ውሕጅ ጎደናታት) *did not* occur due to Hurricane Felicia.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ረብሓ ዘለዎ ዝናብ (Beneficial rain):** The text states rain *did* fall and benefitted parts of the islands.
*   **B: ብነጎዳ ዝተሰነየ ዝናብ (Lightning-struck rain):** The text mentions that some of the rain was struck by lightning (""ገለ ካብ'ቲ ዝናብ ብነጎዳን በርቒን ተሰንዩ ነይሩ"").

Here's why:

* **The passage states Felicia was a tropical storm *before* becoming a category 4 hurricane.** Option B misrepresents this order, saying it started as a category 4 and *then* became a tropical storm. This is a direct contradiction of the text.

Let's look at why the other options are correct and therefore *not* the false statement:

Here's why:

The passage states that researchers found a new species could evolve in *only two generations*. This contrasts with the previous belief that it would take a *long time*, like with Darwin's finches and *Geospiza conorostris*.  The question asks what took longer than the researchers now believe. The creation of the species (its evolution) is the direct contrast presented in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ብዛዕባ እቲ ፍጥረት ጸብጻብ ምቕራብ (Presenting findings about the species)** - The passage is *about* the findings, but the findings themselves don't take time.
*   **C: ምርባሕ ኣብ መንጎ ዝተፈላለዩ ፍጥረታት (Breeding between different species)** -  The passage focuses on the *formation* of a new species, not breeding.
*   **D: ከይዲ ፍልቀት እቲ ፍጥረት (Species divergence)** - While related to evolution, the passage specifically focuses on how quickly a *new* species arose, not the general divergence process.

* **A: እቲ ሓድሽ ፍጥረት ዝተፈጠረሉ ቦታ (The location where the new species formed)** - The passage *does* mention the location: Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands.
* **B: ንውሓት ናይቲ መስርሕ ፍልቀት (The rate of evolutionary change)** - The passage *does* discuss the speed of evolution - how it happened in two generations, which is faster than previously believed.
* **D: እተን ኣብቲ ምርባሕ ዝተሳተፋ ኣዕዋፍ (The birds involved in the breeding)** - The passage mentions Darwin's finches and *Geospiza conorostris* as related, indicating which birds are involved.
* **C: ስም ናይቲ ሓድሽ ፍጥረት (The name of the new species)** - The passage states new species were *discovered*, but it **doesn't actually give the names of those new species.** This is the key piece of information missing.

Therefore, the question is asking what information is *not* provided in the text, and the name of the new species is that missing information."

Here's why:

The text states the goal is to make Bucharest the first ""Kaouparade"" (a public art festival) in the region of Southeastern Europe, aiming to become the largest public art festival in the world. This implies the Kaouparade will extend throughout Southeastern Europe, not just Bucharest or Romania.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብተን “ፈጠራዊት” ተባሂለን ዝሕሰባ ከተማታት ጥራይ እዩ ዝፍጸም:** The passage doesn't limit the festival to ""creative"" cities.
* **B: ብምምሕዳር ከተማ ቡካሬስት ዝተዳለወ እዩ:** While Bucharest is involved, the passage focuses on the festival itself being a large-scale public art event, not solely a city-administered one.
* **D: ኣብ ዓለም እቲ ዝዓበየ ህዝባዊ ስነ-ጥበብ መደብ እዩ:** The passage states it *aims to become* the largest, not that it *is* currently the largest.

Here's why:

The text states that after the accident (ሓደጋ), Russia grounded (ኣጊዳተን) the Il-76s. This directly links the grounding to the accident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ናይ ውሽጢ ሃገር ሰራዊት (Internal army):** While the Il-76 is used by the military, the text doesn't say the grounding was due to its role within the internal army.
*   **C: ወተሃደራዊ ሓይሊ ሶቭየት (Soviet military force):** The text mentions the Il-76's history with the Soviet military, but the *current* grounding is a response to a recent Russian accident.
*   **D: ኣብ ከይዲ ዝርከብ መርመራ (Ongoing investigation):** The text mentions an investigation (ምርመራ), but the grounding was a direct result of the accident, not just the investigation itself.



"
II-76 እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ውትሃደራዊ ነፋሪት (Military aircraft)**.

The text states ""II-76 ካብ 1970 ጀሚሩ ናይ ክልቲአን ሩስያን ሶቪየትን ወተሃደራዊ ክፋል ኮይኑ ጸኒሑን"" which translates to ""II-76 has been a part of both Russian and Soviet military forces since 1970.""  This directly indicates it's a military aircraft. 

The text also describes it crashing (""ብዘይገለ ጉድኣት ሓደ ሞተራ ተፈልዩ ወዲቑ""), something that would apply to an aircraft, not a tank, train or submarine.

The text states ""ሳይሞን... was responsible for firing members of the show’s writing staff."" This directly answers the question about who was in charge of cutting the writing staff. While Brooks and Groening are mentioned as creators, and Ulman is mentioned as being involved in earlier work, the text specifically attributes the firing responsibility to Simon."

Here's why:

The passage states that Fuluq reached this decision ""because many positive views and encouragements were received from both boys and girls."" This clearly indicates that both groups provided support and positive feedback, influencing his decision.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሓካይም (Hakaym)** - The passage doesn't mention Hakaym at all.
*   **B: ነጠፍቲ ጥዕና ደቂ ኣንስትዮ (Women's health professionals)** - While relevant to the topic, the passage specifically mentions support from boys *and* girls.
*   **C: ደቂ ተባዕትዮ (Boys)** - The passage states it was both boys *and* girls.

The passage states the decision was made ""to prevent girls from discussing health issues."" This directly relates to preventing discussion *about* the health of girls.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ደቂ ተባዕትዮ ውልቀሰባት (Associated boys' contracts):**  The passage doesn't mention anything about contracts or boys.
* **B: ወጻኢታት ሕክምና (Medical outcomes):** While the passage touches on medical treatment (contraceptives), it's not about the *outcomes* of medical care, but preventing the discussion of health.
* **D: ፍሉክ (Luck):**  The passage mentions the decision being made ""by luck"" but the question asks *what* people are prevented from discussing.

* **The passage also mentions:** ""...ከም ማይ እዩ ክገብራ ዝብል ዘሎ። ከም ማይ እዩ ኣሕሊፉ ዘርኢ።"" - This describes liquids flowing on a surface, which aligns with Titan's methane and ethane seas and rivers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ጁፒተር** - Jupiter is a gas giant with immense storms, but not known for stable surface liquids.
* **C: ጸሓይ** - The Sun is a star, made of plasma, not a planet with liquid surfaces.
* **D: ሳተርን** - Saturn is also a gas giant, famous for its rings, but not surface liquids.

Here's why:

* The passage discusses how the discovered structure isn't a fully developed feather but represents an intermediate stage in feather evolution. It describes features like barbules and a rachis, suggesting a transition from simpler structures to more complex feathers.  Scientists believe it's a step in understanding *how* feathers developed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ሕብሪ ላሕሚ ናይ’ቲ እንስሳ (The animal's internal structure):** While the passage mentions a possible internal structure resembling cartilage, the main focus isn’t on the animal's internal anatomy.
* **B: እቶም ክንቲት ኣብ በረራ ከምዘይጥቀሙሉ ምርዳእ (Determining that the feathers couldn't be used for flight):**  The passage does suggest the structure wasn't for flight, but that's a consequence of its form, not the *main* takeaway.
* **D: መብዛሕትኦም ዳይኖሰር ክንቲት ከም ዝነበሮም መረጋገጺ (Confirmation that most dinosaurs had feathers):**  The discovery supports the idea that some dinosaurs had feathers, but the primary focus is on the evolutionary *process* of feather development.

The passage states: ""ናይ ዳይኖሶር ክንቲታት ራቺስ ዝበሃል ብደንቢ ዝማዕበለ ናይ ማኣኸል ደጋፊ ዓምዲ ዘይብሎም"". This directly translates to ""Dinosaurs' teeth did *not* have a rachis, a strong supporting column for the enamel"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ባርቡልስ:** The passage says dinosaurs *did* have barbules.
*   **C: ናይ ዓቢ ተሪር ክንቲታዊ ሽፋን:** The passage mentions this as a characteristic *of* the sample, not something the teeth lacked.
*   **D: ፍሕሽው ሕብሪ ዘለዎ ትሕተ-ቅርጺ:** The passage describes the internal structure as similar to a carrot, indicating they *did* have internal structures.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Zmapp served as a ""control"" in the PALM trial.**  A control group is used for comparison, not as a tool for cutting or trimming. The passage explicitly says it was compared *to* three other types of treatment.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: ካብ ኣንቲ ቦዲ ዝስራሕ እዩ** - The passage mentions Zmapp is an antibody, and antibodies work within the body.
* **B: ንዝጸንሑ ረኽስታት ናይ ምፍዋስ ዓቕሚ’ኳ እንተሃለዎ ሞት ናይ ምክልኻል ዓቕሚ ግን የብሉን** - This accurately reflects the passage's statement that Zmapp showed modest benefit in reducing mortality but wasn't as effective as initially hoped.
* **D: መጽናዕትታት ከም ዘመልክትዎ፡ ረብሓታቱ ካብቲ ኣብ መጀመርታ ዝሕሰብ ዝነበረ ዝወሓደ እዩ** - This is a direct paraphrase of the passage which states the benefits were ""less than anticipated.""

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""ኣብ'ቲ PALM መጽናዕታዊ ፈተነ፣ Zmapp ከም መተሓላለዊ ኣገልጊሉ፣ እዚ ማለት ድማ ክኢላ ሳይንስ ከም መበገሲ ብምጥቃም ነቶም ሰለስተ ካልኦት ዓይነታት ሕክምና ምስኡ ኣወዳዲሮሞም ማለት እዩ።""  This directly translates to ""In the PALM study, Zmapp served as a control, meaning it was compared with three other types of treatment using a clinical trial.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't say the trial *confirmed* higher benefits than previously thought, only that Zmapp had *less* benefit than initially hoped.
* **C:** While Zmapp *was* used in the trial, the passage focuses on the trial *comparing* Zmapp to others, not just its use *of* the trial.
* **D:** The passage doesn't state that the trial proved the treatments effective for severe cases. It focuses on the comparison and Zmapp's disappointing results.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the chip is intended to help patients in ""resource-limited countries"" by allowing for early detection of diseases like cancer, tuberculosis, HIV, and Lyme disease. The researchers believe it can be a significant benefit in places where access to advanced diagnostics is limited.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ሃብታም ሃራት** - The passage contrasts its usefulness *with* places that have fewer resources.
* **C: ኣብ ኣሜሪካ** - While the research was conducted at Stanford in the US, the primary focus is on global impact, not just the US.
* **D: ኣብ ዩኒቨርሲቲ ስታንፎርድ** - The university is where the research *happened*, but not who it's *for*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ነፍሲ ወከፎም ሓደ ሳንቲም ኣሜሪካ** (A US dime itself) - While a dime is *used* in the creation, it's not the method.
*   **C: ፕሪንት ክግበሩ ዝኽእሉ ቺፕስ** (Chips that can print) - The text doesn't mention any chips.
*   **D: ካልኦት ናይ መርመራ መሳርሒታት** (Other diagnostic tools) - This is too broad; the question asks about the *method* of producing this specific tool.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""This idea clashes with the idea that the moon is completely devoid of geological activity."" This directly contradicts the claim that the moon has *no* geological activity.  The passage suggests the features are evidence of *recent* geological activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: እቶም ዝፈጠርዎም ፍጻመታት ኣብ ቀረባ እዋን ዘጋጠሙ ክኾኑ ይኽእሉ እዮም:** The passage explicitly supports this idea - ""by a recent geological process.""

* **D: መብዛሕትኦም ኣብ ገጽ ወርሒ ኣይተረኽቡን:** The passage states they are ""Earth-crossing paths"" meaning they *are* visible on the lunar surface.

Here's why:

The passage states ""ezi ziserhochum nay jiololoji fcameatat bqereba zmn zeneberu mukhano yemlakht"" which translates to ""this suggests that the geological processes that created these formations were recent"".  Option D directly reflects this idea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ወርሒ ቀስ እንዳበለትት እንዳቀነሰት እያ** - While the passage mentions the moon cooling and contracting, this is presented as the *cause* of the formations, not the evidence of recent geological activity.
*   **B: እቶም ቅርጽታት መሬት ቅድሚ ነዊሕ እዋን ዝተፈጥሩ እዮም** - The passage explicitly suggests the opposite - that they are relatively *new*.
*   **C: ኣብ ገጽ ወርሒ ካብ ዝርከቡ ቅርጺ መሬት ውሑዳት ጥራይ እዮም** - The passage doesn't discuss the *quantity* of formations, only their nature and age.

The passage states, ""ሓፈሻዊ ክሲ ዝቕበል ቤት ፅሕፈት ክረውን ክሲ ክሳብ ዝቐርብ ተወሳኺ መግለፂ ከምዘይውሃብ ንጋዜጠኛታት ገሊፁ.""  This translates to: ""The office accepting temporary custody stated to journalists that it would not provide additional information until the trial.""

This directly means journalists will not receive ""ተወሳኺ ርእይቶታት"" (additional insights/information) until the trial.  The other options are not mentioned as being withheld:

* **B: ስእላዊ ጽሑፋት (visual documents):** The passage discusses images being potentially harmful, but doesn't say they are being withheld.
* **C: ዘተ ብዛዕባ መርትዖታት ናይ ዓይኒ መሰኻኽር (details about eye witness testimonies):** The passage mentions concern about eyewitnesses, but doesn't say details about their testimonies are being withheld.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Pitman believes the *size and intensity* of the hail (ርጉዲ ናይቲ በረድ) has been greater in recent years than the previous 15 years. This means hail size and intensity is something *different* than just typical hailstorms for Silers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ጽንኩር ኩነታት ኣየር (tsinkur kunetat ayir) - Stormy Weather:** The passage mentions stormy weather generally, but doesn't highlight it as being unusual for Silers.
* **B: መጠን በረድ (metan bereḍ) - Amount of Hail:** The passage focuses on the *size and intensity* of the hail, not just the amount.
* **D: ምቕላጥ በረድ (miqlat bereḍ) - Hail Falling:** This is just a general description of hail and not something unusual for Silers.



"
ብዘይካ እቲ በረድ፡ ካልእ ንጻዕርታት ምድሓን ህይወት ዝጸልዎ እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ኩነታት ኣየር (Climate)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the impact of the cold on the climate and weather patterns.** It mentions changing temperatures, the intensity of cold snaps, and how this is unusual compared to the last 15 years.  Pitman notes that the severity of the cold is impacting the climate.
* **Option A (ሕጽረት ናይ ቀረብ - Lack of proximity):** This isn't discussed in the passage.
* **Option C (ሓገዝ ዘይምህላው - Lack of help):**  The passage doesn't mention a lack of assistance.
* **Option D (ሲለርስ - Silers):** While ""Silers"" is mentioned as being affected by the cold, it's *an effect* of the climate change, not a separate threat to life like the climate itself.

Therefore, the question asks for other threats to life besides the cold, and the passage establishes that **climate** is the broader issue at play.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on Roberts's belief that a judge should not preemptively reveal how they would rule on issues like when life begins. This is because doing so would be ""outside of the realm of ethics,"" implying he believes ethical considerations are paramount when *judging* such matters.  The passage emphasizes his adherence to established legal precedent (""the common law of the land"") and his belief in impartiality.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: ትርጉም ቅኑዕ ውሳነታት ላዕለዋይ ቤት ፍርዲ (Interpretation of the Supreme Court's rulings):** While precedent is mentioned, the core argument isn't about *interpreting* rulings, but how a judge should *conduct themselves* ethically.
* **C: ናይ ህይወት መጀመርታ (Beginning of life):** This is the *subject* of potential rulings, not Roberts's central point. He avoids stating his personal belief on this.
* **D: ናይ ውልቃውነት መሰል (Right to consent):** This isn't mentioned in the passage at all.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states Roberts affirmed the fundamental right of a defendant to be presumed innocent, echoing Roy V. Wade's assertion that it's ""the cornerstone of law.""  The question asks what Roberts found particularly reprehensible - *forcing* a confession based on potential future scenarios, which violates that core principle of presumed innocence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ንጽንዓት ውሳነታት ላዕለዋይ ቤት ፍርዲ (Strength of Supreme Court decisions):**  While the passage mentions the authority of the court, it's not the *primary* issue Roberts is objecting to.
* **B: ውሳነ ሮይ ኣንጻር ዌድ (Roy's decision versus Wade):**  The passage uses Wade to *illustrate* the importance of a principle, but Roberts isn't contrasting their decisions.
* **D: ዝርዝር ጕዳያት (Specific cases):** The passage focuses on the ethical *principle* at stake, not the details of specific cases.

The text states: ""ብምሸት ናብ ሰማይ ዝበርሁ ክልተ ጩራታት ብርሃን ተገጢሞም ኣለዉ."" which translates to ""Three columns of light were seen rising into the sky in the evening.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብታ ስግር ከተማ** (In the city's foundation) - The text doesn't mention the light originating from the ground.
* **C: ኣብቲ ዕላማ ናይታ ቀዳመይቲ ጀት** (At the target of the first jet) - The text says the jet *hit* a target, but doesn't connect the light to that specific location.
* **D: ኣብ ማእከል ናይ መዘከርታ መናፈሻ** (In the center of the memorial park) - While the text mentions a memorial park, it doesn't say the light was centered there."

Here's why:

The text states the jet struck the target at precisely 8:46 PM, and that *five new skyscrapers are still under construction in the area, with the transportation hub and memorial park at its center.*  The phrase ""ብምሸት ናብ ሰማይ ዝበርሁ ክልተ ጩራታት ብርሃን ተገጢሞም ኣለዉ"" means that the five skyscrapers were illuminated by lights as they rose towards the sky in the afternoon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ሰዓት 8፡46 ቅ.ቀ.** (8:46 PM) - This is the *time* of the event, not when the skyscrapers are being built.
*   **C: ኣብ ለይቲ** (At night) - The text focuses on the skyscrapers being illuminated *as* they rise, which implies daytime construction.
*   **D: እቲ ህንጸት ቀፃሊ እዩ** (The construction is ongoing) - While true, this doesn't answer the question of *when* they are being built.

* The text specifically states ""ፎቶታት ከምዘርእይዎ ካብ ለይቲ ናብ ለይቲ ረስኒ ዝቐያየረሉ መንገዲ ባዓቲ ከምዝኾኑ የርኢ"" which translates to ""As the photos show, they appear as craters because of the way shadows change from night to night.""  This directly links the changing shadows to the identification of them as craters.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ሰንጣቒቱ ናይቲ በዓቲ መእተዊታት (Diameter of the craters)** - While the diameter is mentioned, it doesn't *prove* they are craters. It's a characteristic *of* them, but not the evidence *for* them.
* **C: መጽናዕትታት ስነ-መሬት (Geological formations)** - The text does mention a geologist's observation, but the geologist is *describing* the craters, not the formations that prove their crater status.
* **D: ስእሊ በዓትታት ኣብ ምድሪ (Images of craters on Earth)** - The text does not state the craters are images of craters on earth. It's talking about craters observed through photos, likely from space.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ""Seven Sisters"" are described as ""resembling subsurface pits rather than large craters with rims that do not change significantly over time.""  This directly correlates to the idea of deep pits in the ground.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ትሕተ-ቀይሕ ምስልታት (Sub-red images):** The passage doesn't mention anything about the color or imagery of the features.
*   **C: ሰንጣቒት ናይቲ በዓትታት (Craters of the craters):** The text specifically says they *aren't* like typical craters.
*   **D: መጽናዕትታት በዓትታት ኣብ ምድሪ (Craters on the ground):** The passage contrasts them with craters and explains they seem to be connected to underground structures."

Here's why:

The text explicitly states ""ካብቲ ነትጒ ኣብ ልዕሊኡ ጉድኣት ድሕሪ ምውራዱ ኣብ ትሕቲ ቐይዲ ኣትዩ"" which means ""After the netgu shot at him, he was put under control."" This directly contradicts the statement that he wasn't harmed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብ እዋን መጥቃዕቲ መኪና ተጠቒሙ:** The text says he *used* a car bomb, it doesn’t say he was targeted *during* a car bombing.
* **B: ነታጒ ከም ዝፈንጀረ ገይሩ ተጠቕሰ:** The text states he *is suspected* of detonating the bomb, which is being accused of being the bomber. 
* **C: ዓሌቱ ብሰበስልጣን እዩ ዝፍለጥ:** The text confirms the security forces know he's Uyghur, but don't know his name.

Therefore, option D is the only statement that directly contradicts the information presented in the text."

The text states: ""ዋላ'ኳ ናይ ዩጉር ዓሌት ምዃኑ ተተፈለጠ ስሙ ግን እቶም ኣመራርሓታት ኣይፈልጥዎን። ሰበ - ስልጣን ኣባል ዓሌት ኡጉር ምዃኑ ይፈልጡ እኳ እንተኾኑ ስሙ ግና ክሳብ ሐዚ ኣይፈልጥዎን እዮም።"" This translates to: ""Although his Uighur ethnicity was confirmed, his name is not known to the authorities. People in power know he is a Uighur, but his name is still unknown.""

This directly indicates that authorities have confirmed the suspect's ethnicity (Uighur). The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ናይ ዝኾነ ተሓባበርቲ መንነት (The identity of any accomplices)** - The text doesn't mention accomplices.
*   **C: እቲ ድሕሪ እቲ መጥቃዕቲ ዝነበረ ድርኺት (The investigation after the attack)** - The text provides a brief overview of the suspect's arrest, not a detailed investigation.
*   **D: ናይቲ ዝተጠርጠር ሰብ ናይ መጀመርታን ናይ መወዳእታን ስም (The first and last name of the suspect)** - The text specifically states the suspect's name is *unknown*.

*   **ስፕሪንግቦክስ** is the name of the South African rugby team.
*   **ኣውስትራልያን** is Australia.

Therefore, the two teams playing in the game at Ellis Park are South Africa and Australia.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that even though one gyroscope failed during the launch of the space station, the station maintained stability until the final orbit. This means a gyroscope failure *was* a problem encountered during the launch.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ካብቶም ዝዕምብቡ ሰባት ግቡእ ርሕቀት ምሕላው (From the people who guessed correct distance):** This is irrelevant to the text.
*   **C: ጀት ምልዓል (Jet refueling):** While jet refueling was used to correct the station's condition, it wasn't a problem *during* launch, but a solution *after* a problem occurred (the gyroscope failure).
*   **D: ንቡር ኣተሓሳስባ ዳግማይ ምርካብ (Re-establishing proper orientation):** This is a consequence of the gyroscope failure, not the problem itself.

Here's why:

The passage describes a space station (መደበር ጠፈር) and its continued operation *despite* a gyroscope failure. The entire context points to the mission being about maintaining and completing a space journey/mission.  The other options are incorrect:

* **A: ዝጠፍአ ጋይሮስኮፕ ምርካብ (Replacing a failed gyroscope):** While a gyroscope *did* fail, the passage doesn't state fixing it was the mission's goal, but rather that the station continued functioning despite the failure.
* **B: ናብቶም ዝዕምብቡ ሰባት ምቕራብ (Transporting passengers):**  The passage doesn't mention passengers.
* **D: እተን ጀት ምንቅስቓስ (Jet maneuvering):** The jets are mentioned only in relation to restoring the station's position, not as the primary goal of the mission.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብታ ዋና ቤት ጽሕፈቱ AOL ኣብ ዘለዎ ግዝኣት እዩ ተኸሲሱ (It was sued in the headquarters of AOL):** While the case originated in Virginia, the passage doesn't mention where the lawsuit was *filed* specifically within AOL's structure.
* **B: ፍርዲ ተገይሩ (The decision was overturned):** The passage states a guilty verdict was *reached* (ውሳነ ዝተረኽበሉ), not that it was overturned.
* **C: ብዛዕባ ስፓም ኢመይል ዝምልከት ሕጊ ኣብ ተመሳሳሊ ኩነታት ኣብ ጥቕሚ ውዒሉ (The law regarding spam email has been upheld in similar situations):** This might be true in general, but the passage doesn't make this claim; it focuses on the *first* time the law was used for a guilty verdict.

* **D: AOL ነቲ ጉዳይ ክሲ ኣበጊሱዎ (AOL filed the lawsuit)** - The passage states AOL *received* the lawsuit (""the company that filed the lawsuit, AOL""), not that it initiated it.

The passage states ""ወዲ 28 ዓመት ቪዳል ቅድሚ ሰለስት ወቕትታት ካብ ሲቪላ ናብ ባርሳ ተቐላቒሉ።"" This translates to ""The 28-year-old Vidal joined Barcelona three years ago from Sevilla."" Therefore, before joining Barcelona, Vidal played for Sevilla."
ቪዳል ምስ ባርሳ ክንደይ ጸወታታት ተጻዊቱ?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The text explicitly states: ""ቪዳል ናብ ርእሰ ከተማ ናይ ካታሎንያ ካብ ምኻዱ እዋን ጀሚሩ፣ ነታ ጋንታ 49 ጸወታታት ተጻዊቱላ ነይሩ።"" which translates to ""Since joining the capital of Catalonia, he has played 49 games for the team."""
ኣብቲ ፀወታ ተፃባኢ ጋንታ መን እዩ ነይሩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ቦሎንያ** (Bologna).

Here's why:

The text states ጃርክ (Jark) had a match with ቦሎኛ (Bologna) on Saturday and stayed at the hotel to prepare for the game. This clearly indicates Bologna was his opponent in the game.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ጃርኪ (Jark):** Jark is the player, not the opponent.
*   **C: ኮቨርቺያኖ (Coverciano):** Coverciano is the place where Jark was training, not an opponent.
*   **D: ጥልያን (Italy):** Italy is the country, not an opponent."
ጃርክ ስለምንታይ ኣብቲ ሆቴል ይሓድር ነይሩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ኣብ ሰንበት ጸወታ ነይርዎ** (He had a game on Saturday).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ሰንበት ምን ቦሎኛ ንዝግበር ጸወታ ኣብ ሆቴል እታ ጋንታ እዩ ዝጸንሕ ኔሩ።"" which directly translates to ""He was staying at the hotel for the game against Bologna on Saturday.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ልምምድ ነይርዎ** (He was training) - While he was in Coverciano for training generally, the reason for being *at the hotel* is specifically linked to the game.
* **B: ናይ ቅድሚ ዓመተ ስፖርት ኣኼባ ነይርዎ** (Pre-season sports meeting) - The text doesn't mention any meetings.
* **D: ምስ ቦሎንያ ልምምድ ይገብር ነይሩ** (He was training with Bologna) - He was playing *against* Bologna, not training *with* them.

ስለምንታይ እዩ ኤጀንሲ ጂኦፊዚክስ ጃካርታ መጠንቀቕታ ክህብ ዘይከኣለ?,"The correct answer is **D: ምንቅጥቃጥ ምድሪ ከጋጥም ከሎ መጠን ዕቤት ዘለዎ ብቕዓት ኣየማልአን** (It doesn't have the capability to determine the magnitude when an earthquake occurs).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the agency (Badan Geofisika Jakarta) couldn't issue an early warning *because the earthquake was measured at a magnitude of 6.5 and they didn't have the capability to issue a warning for that magnitude*. This directly corresponds to option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ሱናሚ ከም ዝመጽእ ዘስግእ ነገር ኣይነበረን** (There was no indication that a tsunami would come) - The text doesn't say there was no indication of a tsunami; it says they couldn't issue a warning for the *earthquake itself*.
* **B: ኣብ መንጎ ነበርቲ ስንባደ ንኸይፍጠር** (To avoid panic among the people) - While people *did* panic, the agency's inability to issue a warning wasn't to prevent panic, it was a technical limitation.
* **C: ኣብ ውሽጢ ዓዲ ኣብ ዝርከባ ትካላት ንግዲ ጽልዋ ንኸይህሉ** (To avoid giving false alarms to areas within the island) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.

Here's why:

The text states, ""ወላ እኳ ናይ ማዕበል ስግኣት እንተዘይሃለወ፣ ነበርቲ ግና ብፍርሒ ገዛውቶምን ስርሖምን እንዳሓደጉ ምውጻእ ጀሚረፐም ኣለዉ"" which translates to ""Even though there was no tsunami warning, people were starting to evacuate their homes and workplaces out of fear.""

This directly indicates the result of the earthquake was people evacuating.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ስግኣት ሱናሚ (Tsunami warning):** The text specifically says there *wasn't* a tsunami warning.
*   **C: ዝተዋህበ መጠንቀቕታ (Issued warning):** The text states no warning was issued.
*   **D: 6.5 ናይ ማግኒትዩድ ስኬል (6.5 magnitude scale):** This is the magnitude of the earthquake, but not the *result* or what it caused."

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The movement of all stars within a structured system is guided by light, density, and other factors. Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) utilize the number of a star's rosebuds (Rosby number) to predict flares when the star encounters magnetic reconnection.
* **Breaking it down:**
    * **ብርሃን (Light):** Explicitly mentioned as guiding star movement.
    * **ቁጽሪ ሮስቢ (Rosby number):** Directly linked to predicting stellar flares and therefore, activity.
    * **ምዝዋር (Rotation):** The passage implicitly connects rotation with the creation of CMEs and the magnetic reconnection process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ብርሃንን ዋሕዚ ፕላዝማን (Light and Plasma):** While plasma is related to stars, the passage doesn't present it as a fundamental driving factor *in the same way* as the others.
* **B: ሮሲ ቁጽሪ፡ ምዝዋር፡ ከምኡውን ማግኔታዊ ምግልባጥ (Rosby number, Rotation, and Magnetic Reconnection):** Magnetic reconnection is a *result* of other factors, not a fundamental driver itself.
* **C: ምዝዋርን ብርሃንን (Rotation and Light):**  Missing the crucial element of the Rosby number which is key to predicting activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ብርሃንን ምዝዋርን (Brightness and Rotation):** While brightness and rotation *are used* to calculate the Rosby number, they are not the Rosby number *itself*.
*   **C: ደረጃ ንጥፈታት (Degree of eruptions):** This is not mentioned in the passage as being related to the Rosby number.
*   **D: መጠን ማግነታዊ ለውጢ (Amount of magnetic change):** The passage mentions magnetic changes are *affected* by the Rosby number (the star becomes unstable), but are not used to *calculate* it.

The text states: ""ካብቶም መጽናዕቲ እተገብረሎም ሰባት፥ 29 ሚእታዊ ኣውስትራልያ ብዝተኻእለ መጠን ቀልጢፍካ ሪፓብሊክ ክትከውን ከም ዘለዋ ክኣምኑ ኸለዉ..."" This directly answers the question."

Here's why:

The text states: ""29 ሚእታዊ ኣውስትራልያ ብዝተኻእለ መጠን ቀልጢፍካ ሪፓብሊክ ክትከውን ከም ዘለዋ ክኣምኑ ኸለዉ"".  This directly reflects Julia Gillard's belief (as reported in the text) that Australia should become a republic *as soon as possible*.



"
ኣየናይ ትካል እዩ ሕጋዊ መርመራ ዝግበረሉ ዘሎ?,"The correct answer is **A: ኮሚተ ጸዓትን ንግድን ኣባይቲ**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Cliff Stern is conducting an investigation ""by way of subpoena and family trust"" which is ""under the auspices of the Oversight and Audit Committee."" This directly identifies the committee as the body conducting the legal scrutiny. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ትካል ኮመን ፋውንዴሽን** - Leslie Owen is discussing a new rule *for* the Common Foundation, but the Foundation isn't directly conducting the legal review.
*   **C: ዝተወጠነ ወላዲነት** - This refers to the topic of Stern's investigation, not the entity doing the investigating.
*   **D: ንኡስ ኮሚተ ክትትልን መርመራታትን** - This is a sub-committee *under* the Oversight and Audit Committee, not the primary entity."
ክሊፍ ስቲርንስ ኣቦወንበር ኣየናይ ኮሚቴ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ኮሚተ ጸዓትን ንግድን ኣባይቲ**.

The text states: ""ስቲርንስ ከም ኣቦወንበር ናይቲ ኣብ ትሕቲ ጽላል ናይ ገዛ ጸዓትን ንግድን ኮሚቴ ዝርከብ..."" which translates to ""Sterns as chairman of the committee under the shadow of his own profits and losses..."" 

Therefore, Kliﬀ Sterns is the chairman of the profits and losses committee."

Here's why:

The text states, ""ነታ ስዊዘርላንዳዊት ሰበይቲ ዝደፈሩ ሓሙሽት ሰባት ኣብ ቀይዲ ዊዒሎም"". This translates to ""Five people who assaulted the Swiss woman have been arrested.""  This directly indicates the woman was a victim of sexual assault.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ዝተሰርቀ ኣቑሑታ ተረኺቡ (Recovered stolen valuables)** - While stolen items were recovered, the text focuses on the assault *against* the woman, not the recovery of property.
*   **B: ተቐቲላ (Was murdered)** - The text does not mention the woman being killed.
*   **D: ቴለፎናታን ላፕቶፓታን ተሰሪቑ (Her phone and laptop were stolen)** - This is a detail *related* to the crime, but it's not what the woman herself experienced. The primary crime against her was the assault."
ኣየናይ ትካል እዩ ኣብ 2007 ሽልማት ዘላቒነት ታይዋን ዝተሸለመ?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the ASUS Eee PC was a major highlight of the 2007 Taipei IT show. It also states that it was *first* released to the world in 2007.  The question asks which company won an award in Taiwan in 2007. Therefore, ASUS is the logical answer.

The passage doesn't mention Samsung, Sony, or Lenovo winning awards in Taiwan in 2007."
ASUS Eee(ኤሰስ ኢኢኢ) ላፕቶፕ እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ላፕቶፕ**.

The passage clearly states ""ብላፕቶፕ ኮምፒተር ኣብ ልዕሊ ዘሎ ናይ ሸማቲ ዕዳጋ"" which translates to ""a laptop computer above the market price."" It further describes the ASUS Eee PC as being released in 2007.  Therefore, it is a laptop.
"
በቲ ዝጠፍአ ሰነዳት ፖስታ መን እዩ ተሓታቲ?,"The correct answer is **A: ሰራሕተኛታት ፖስታ (Postal workers)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the postal office (ቤት ጽሕፈት ፖስታ) confirmed they didn't receive the cards, and later found over 429 New Year's postcards. This implies the postal workers were responsible for handling the mail and are therefore the ones accountable for the missing documents.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ጉጅለ ነበርቲ ኦባናዛዋ (Obanazawa Residents' Group):** The residents sent the cards, they are not the ones responsible for *receiving* them.
*   **C: ሓደ ወዲ (One person):** The issue involves a large number of cards and a system failure, not a single individual's mistake.
*   **D: መራኸቢ ብዙሃን (Media):** The media reported on the issue, they are not responsible for the missing mail."

Here's why:

The text states the residents (described as ""dozens of local traditional... cardholders"") went to the Obanazawa post office because their cards hadn't been delivered. They are the ones who experienced the issue and therefore lodged the complaint regarding the missing documents (the New Year's postcards).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: እቲ ወዲ (The sender):** The text doesn't mention the sender lodging a complaint.
*   **C: መራኸቢ ብዙሃን (Media):** The media *received* the information, they didn't make the initial complaint.
*   **D: ቤት ጽሕፈት ፖስታ ኦባናዛዋ (Obanazawa post office):** The post office *confirmed* the issue, they didn't complain about it. They are the subject of the complaint.

Here's why:

The text states that Del Potro has the opportunity to return to the match ""after 6-6 after reaching the second break point."" This directly links the return opportunity to the *second set*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብ እዋን ቀዳማይ ሰት** - The text mentions the first set only in relation to being down a break point.
* **B: ቅድሚ ናይ ቀዳማይ ማዕረ ዕረፍቲ** - The opportunity arises *after* the 6-6 tie, which implies a set is already nearing completion.
* **D: ድሕሪ ናይ ሳልሳይ ማዕረ ዕረፍቲ** - The text only references the second set and a possible return *during* the second set, not after a third set break."

Here's why:

The text states that after the score reached 6-6, both players needed a break.  Then it says Del Potro went to the locker room and *could* return to the match. This implies he didn't return, and thus, retired. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text doesn't say a leader was determined in the first set.
*   **C & D:** The text doesn't specify who won the second set, only that it was potentially going to be played.

The text states: “ሎመዓንቲ ዝተወሰኑ ዕድሚኦም ንትምህርቲ ዝበፅሑ ቆልዑ ምስቲ ሕሙም ንኽክእ ከምዝነበሮም ፈሊጥና ኣለና።” This translates to ""We found that some students with limited opportunities for education were able to access healthcare."" The administrator is the one *finding* this connection – implying they were dealing with the situation of students accessing healthcare while potentially sick.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ቖልዑ (Students):** While students are mentioned, they are the recipients of healthcare, not the ones who were grappling with the situation.
*   **C: ሰበስልጣን ቴክሳስ (Texas authorities):** The text mentions Texas authorities generally, but doesn’t state they were directly involved in a specific instance with a patient.
*   **D: ዜጋታት እቲ ከባቢ (Local citizens):** The text doesn't mention local citizens being directly involved in a specific situation with a sick individual.

Here's why:

The passage states the administrator said, “ሎመዓንቲ ዝተወሰኑ ዕድሚኦም ንትምህርቲ ዝበፅሑ ቆልዑ ምስቲ ሕሙም ንኽክእ ከምዝነበሮም ፈሊጥና ኣለና።” and then “እዚ ጉዳይ እዚ ኸቢድ እዩ። ስርዓትና ኸምቲ ዝግብኦ ገይሩ ይሰርሕ ኸም ዘሎ ርግጸኛታት ኩኑ።”

This indicates the administrator is **hoping** the system works correctly, but doesn't **confirm** that it actually *is* working correctly. He is asking for reassurance (""ርግጸኛታት ኩኑ"") which implies he doesn't have that certainty.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ድሕንነት ህዝቢ ንምሕላው ዝግበሩ ነገራት ይሰርሑ ኣለው:** The passage mentions efforts to address the problem (""ስጉምትታት ከምዝተወሰዱ""), implying action is being taken.
* **C: ነቲ ብድሆ ንምግጣም ተዓጢቖም ኣለዉ:** The passage states the problem is being “ውጺአ”, meaning they are trying to address it.
* **D: እቲ ጉዳይ ዕቱብ ኣይኮነን:** The administrator explicitly acknowledges the situation is “ኸቢድ” (serious).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""The Onion, the satirical news source that began as a student publication at Washington University in 1988...""  It then goes on to describe its growth and features. The other options are not mentioned as being founded by students at Washington University."

Here's why:

The passage lists several things ""The Onion"" has expanded into:

*   Website
*   Personal fan pages
*   24-hour news network
*   Music network
*   World map

It also mentions print editions (D: ሕትመት ዝሓዘ ሕታም). It does **not** mention film/movies. While satirical news can *inspire* films, the passage doesn't state that ""The Onion"" itself produces them.

Therefore, **film** is the only option not directly listed as something ""The Onion"" has branched into."

The text states: ""...ብፖሊስ ኣብ ዝሕለው መእተዊ ጎዳና ዳውኒንግ..."" which means the police were stationed at Downing Street.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣደባባይ ትራፋልጋር** - The protesters *moved* to Trafalgar Square, the police weren't stationed there initially.
* **B: ዘ ስፕሪንግ ፎረም** - This isn't mentioned in the text.

Here's why:

The passage states that Dr. Ure, ""like other scholars, also doubts whether diabetes can be cured, because the observed outcomes did not cause any change in people with type 1 diabetes."" This directly indicates he's questioning the possibility of a cure, and therefore, the views of other researchers who believe in a cure.

*   **A: ርኽበታት ንዓይነት 1 ሕማም ሽኮር ዘለዎም ሰባት ኣገዳሲ እንተኾይኑ (If the results are significant for people with type 1 diabetes):** The passage explicitly says the results *weren't* significant for people with type 1 diabetes.
*   **B: ኽፍወሱ ዝኽእሉ እንተ ዀይኖም (If they can be reversed):** While related to a potential cure, the passage focuses on Dr. Ure's doubt about a cure itself, not just reversibility.
*   **D: እቶም ሕማም ሽኮር ዘይብሎም ኣናጹ ከምኡ ኮይኖም ዝጸንሑ እንተኾይኖም (If the children who no longer have diabetes remain so):** The passage mentions the children, but Dr. Ure’s doubt relates to the broader question of a cure for type 1 diabetes, not just the longevity of remission in these children."

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the first attempt to take off was aborted *because* of bad weather conditions (""ብሰንኪ ኩነታት ኣየር""). This directly corresponds to option A, which says the plane couldn't take off due to the weather.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage doesn't mention the plane being far away after the crash. It emphasizes the difficulty of reaching the crash site due to the terrain.
*   **C:** The passage states there were attempts to take off, but it doesn't say how many times it tried before the eventual crash.
*   **D:** This refers to the search efforts being hampered by the weather *after* the crash, not the initial takeoff attempt.

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states: ""እቲ ፍተሻ ነቲ ኣውሮፕላን ንከይዓርፍ ዝገበሮ ሕማቕ ኩነታት ኣየር ተኣጓጉሉ እዩ"" which translates to ""The search was hindered by the bad weather conditions that caused the plane to not be able to land."" This directly explains why the flight CG4684 couldn't land.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't say the location was inaccessible, only that it was difficult to reach.
*   **B:** There's no mention of other flights in the passage.
*   **C:** While the flight was *going* to Kokoda, the problem wasn't that the wind was *towards* Kokoda, but the bad conditions prevented the landing.

* **A: መስኮት ክሰብር ክኢሉ (The windows could be broken)** - The text explicitly states the windows *didn't* break despite attempts.
* **C: ክወጽእ እናፈተነ ሓደ መንበር ሰይሩ (He broke a chair while trying to get out)** - The passage says a *seat* (not necessarily a chair) was broken *after* people started climbing out the window.
* **D: መስኮት ክሰብር ኣብ ዝፈተነሉ እዋን እዩ ተጎዲኡ ነይሩ (He was injured while trying to break the window)** - The text doesn't mention Fransisek Koal being injured. It only states he was a survivor and gave a statement.

ትሮፒካል ህቦብላ ዳንየል ከስዕቦ ዝኽእል ጽልዋ ምግማት በዳሂ ዝዀነ ስለምንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **D: እቲ ህቦብላ ካብ ሚያሚ ኣዝዩ ርሒቑ ዝርከብ እዩ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""እቲ ህቦብላ ካብ መሬት ኣዝዩ ዝረሓቐ ብምዃኑ ኣብ ሕቡራት መንግስታት ኣሜሪካ ወይ ካሪብያን ከሕድሮ ዝኽእል ጽልዋ ንምግምጋም ኣጸጋሚ እዩ ።"" (The hurricane is very far from land, making it difficult to predict its potential path to the United States or the Caribbean.)

This directly explains why predicting its path is challenging - it's distance from land.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: እቲ ህቦብላ ናብ ሃሪኬን ክሕይል ምዃኑ ይግመት** - While the passage mentions it *could* strengthen into a hurricane, this doesn't explain the difficulty in predicting its path.
*   **B: ተመራመርቲ ስነ-ፍልጠት ብዛዕባ’ቲ ህቦብላ ቀጸልቲ ንፋሳት ርግጸኛታት ኣይኮኑን** - The passage doesn't state that researchers are unsure about wind speeds.
*   **C: እቲ ህቦብላ ካብ ምድረበዳ ርሒቑ ይርከብ** -  The passage mentions it being far from *land* in general, not specifically deserts.

Here's why:

The passage states that some sources believe the disease *should have the ability to be controlled before it causes a global pandemic*.  This implies that it needs to have a low fatality rate (few deaths) to be successfully contained.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: እቲ ምልክታት ቀሊል ኮይኑ ክቕጽል ኣለዎ (The symptoms should remain mild)** - While mild symptoms are mentioned as a concern for spreading, the core idea is about *control* before a pandemic, not simply having mild symptoms.
* **C: ዝያዳ ሰባት በቲ ቫይረስ ክልከፉ የድሊ (More people need to be infected by the virus)** - This is the opposite of what is desired for pandemic control.
* **D: ህጻናት ምልክታት ከርእዩ ኣለዎም (Children should show symptoms)** - The passage focuses on vaccination efforts to protect children from getting sick, not on them needing to show symptoms.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ እቲ ህቦብላ ካብ ፉጂያን ክንደይ ርሒቑ እዩ ነይሩ?,"The correct answer is **A: 9 ኪሎ ሜተር**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks for the distance of the storm from Fujian.** The passage states the storm was initially 70 kilometers from Fujian.
* **The passage then states the storm is moving towards China at 11 km/hour.**
* **However, the question asks for the *current* distance, *after* the storm has moved for a time.** It states the storm moved for 9 hours.
* **Therefore, the storm moved 9 hours * 11 km/hour = 99 kilometers.**
* **The storm started 70km away and moved 99km closer, meaning it is now 70 - 99 = -29km away.** This means that the storm has passed Fujian and is now 29km away on the other side. The closest of the answers is 9km.

The text states that George W. Bush was welcomed by both Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Wong Kan Seng. Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ቡሽ ነቶም ተዓዘብቲ ብዛዕባ ዝርግሐ ናይ ንግጺ ናብ ኤሽያ ነጊርዎ።"" which translates to ""Bush told the attendees about his trip to Asia."" This directly links the discussion about the trip to his one-week visit to Asia.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ናብ ሲንጋፖር ምስ ኣተወ** - He talked about the trip *before* arriving in Singapore.
*   **B: ምስ ቮንግ ካን ሴንግ** - He discussed terrorism with Wong Kan Seng, but the passage doesn’t say this is when he talked about the trip.
*   **C: ኣብ መፋርቕ ምርጫ ዘጋጠሞ ክሳራ ስዕረት ስዒቡ** - The passage mentions the election result, but doesn’t link it to his discussion of the trip.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""The government issued a decree to employ an additional 300 drivers in March of this year.""  This directly relates to increasing the number of drivers by March.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: 300 ጠቕላላ ተሸከምቲ ምጥራይ (Employing a total of 300 drivers):** The passage doesn't say they're *only* employing 300, it's an *addition* to the existing 1,000.
    * **C: ተወሳኺ 1,300 ተሸከምቲ ምጥራይ (Employing an additional 1,300 drivers):** The passage clearly states 300, not 1,300.
    * **D: ልዕሊ ዓቐን ምጽቃጥ ተሸከምቲ ምቅላል (Distributing drivers above the norm):**  The passage focuses on *increasing* the number of drivers, not redistributing them.

Therefore, option A is the only one that accurately reflects the government's stated goal in the passage."
መንግስቲ እንታይ ዕላዊ ገይሩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ተወሳኺ 300 ተሸከምቲ ንምምዋል መደብ ኣለዎም**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""300 ብምውሳኽ እቲ ጠቕላላ ቁጽሪ 1,300 ተሸከምቲ ነቲ ምጭንናቕ ይቕንሶ."" (By increasing by 300, the total number of 1,300 drivers will cover the demand.)

This directly indicates the government's goal is to add 300 more drivers, bringing the total to 1,300.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage doesn't mention a ""promise"" to solve a driver shortage; it describes an action to *address* it.
* **C:** The passage says they are adding 300 *to* reach 1,300, not that they aim for 1,300 additional drivers.
* **D:** The passage specifies the time frame (March) but doesn't mention a ""problem exceeding capacity"" being open until then. It simply states the increase is *for* March.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ኣየናይ ሓበሬታ እዩ ዝፍለጥ?,"The correct answer is **A: እቲ ናይ ስግኣት ደረጃ ነክዩ**.

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""There is no information about how much faith is required to reach a critical point."" and ""Even if faith is reduced to a certain level, it doesn't mean the faith completely disappears.""
* **Q asks:** What kind of information is being discussed?
* **Option A** directly addresses this, stating the discussion revolves around *the level of faith*.  The passage focuses on whether a reduction in faith necessarily means its total loss, implying a concern with the *degree* or *level* of faith.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ድሕሪ ሕጂ ዝኾነ ስግኣት የለን (There will be no faith in the future):**  The passage doesn't talk about faith ceasing to exist altogether, only about its potential to diminish.
* **C: መጥቃዕቲ ክፍጸም ትጽቢት ይግበር (Observation is made to open the critical point):** The passage doesn’t talk about observation or a “critical point” being opened.
* **D: እቲ መጥቃዕቲ ከቢድ ከምዝኸውን ስለያዊ ሓበሬታ ኣረጋጊጹ ኣሎ (Information is confirmed about the critical point being severe):** The passage doesn't confirm anything about the severity of the ""critical point"" (መጥቃዕቲ). It only states we don't *know* how much faith is needed to reach it.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""The commission's move followed widespread protests in Martelly, which began in October over his government’s handling of a controversial electoral law.""  This directly indicates that the commission's action (proposing the dissolution of the CEP) was *in response to* the protests.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ግዜኡ ዝሓለፎ መረጻ ነቲ ተቓውሞታት ኣበጊስዎ:** The text doesn't say the protests were triggered by past elections, but rather a *current* electoral law.
* **C: ተቓውሞታት እቲ ቅድሚኡ ዝነበረ CEP ካብ ስልጣኑ ክወርድ ይጠልብ ነይሩ:** The passage doesn't mention the protests specifically demanding the removal of the previous CEP.
* **D: እቲ ተቓውሞ ሓድሓደ ግዜ ዓመጽ ዝመልኦ እዩ ነይሩ:** While the passage mentions some groups have been protesting since 2011, it doesn’t characterize the protests as consistently violent.

The text states: ""ዝሓለፈ ወርሒ ፕረዚዳንታዊ ኮሚሽን እታ ሃገር ናብ ቀጻሊ መረጻ ንምስግጋር ዘኽእልዋ ናይ ጥቕሉላት ስጉምትታት ኣካል ብምዃን እቲ ዝነበረ “ሲኢፒ” መልቀቒ ሓሳብ ኣቕረበ።"" 

This directly translates to: ""Last month, the Presidential Commission proposed the dissolution of the 'CEP' as an entity capable of facilitating the continuation of elections in the country.""

Therefore, the Presidential Commission is the one that proposed removing the CEP.

Here's why:

The passage states that US Gymnastics ""embraces an independent investigation to determine the full extent of Nassar’s abuse and welcomes the resulting changes."" This directly indicates they support a free and impartial investigation into the abuse perpetrated by Nassar.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ምውጋድ ምስክር ወረቐት (Contesting evidence):** The passage does *not* indicate US Gymnastics is contesting any evidence.
* **B: ሓይሊ ዘለዎ ሃዋህው ምፍጣር (Creating a culture of empowerment):** While the passage mentions wanting to create a safe environment, it doesn't state this is a response to denying Nassar’s crimes.
* **C: ኣብ ውሽጢ እቲ ትካል ኣድላዪ ለውጢ (Significant changes within the organization):** The passage does mention changes, but these are *resulting* from the investigation, not a way to downplay the abuse.

Here's why:

The passage states that both USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the goal of creating a safe and positive environment for athletes, and specifically mentions addressing the long-term cover-up of Larry Nassar's abuses. The passage states ""ጂምናስቲክ ኣሜሪካን ዩኤስኦሲንን ተመሳሳሊ ዕላማ ኣለዎም-- ንሱ እውን ነቲ ጂምናስተክስ ስፖርቲን ካልኦትን ንኣትሌታት ሕልሞም ንከሳኽዑ ድሕንነቱ ዝታሓለወን፣ ኣዎናተዊን መበረታትዒ ኩነታት ዝፈጥር ንኽኸውን ምግባር እዩ."" which directly links their shared goal to the Nassar situation. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ምውጋድ ምስክር ወረቐት ምግባር (Preparing witness statements):** The passage doesn't mention anything about preparing statements.
*   **C: ናይ ብሕቲ መርመራ ምግባር (Conducting thorough investigations):** While investigations are mentioned, it's not the overarching, shared goal. It's a step *towards* the main goal.
*   **D: ንኣትሌታት ውሑስ ሃዋህው ምድንፋዕ (Advancing a less competitive environment for athletes):** The passage focuses on safety and support, not necessarily reducing competition."

The passage states: ""እታ መርከብ ነታጒ ትጻረራ ስለ ዝነበረት ናብታ ኣብ ፓላዋን እትርከብ ፖርቶ ፕሪንስሳ ትጐዓዝ ነበረት"" which translates to ""Because the ship was heading towards the enemy, it was heading to Puerto Princesa in Palawan.""  This directly confirms the ship is traveling *towards* the enemy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ናብ ፑርቶ ፕሪንሰሳ ገጻ ትኸይድ ነይራ** (It is not heading towards Puerto Princesa) -  The passage states it *was* heading towards Puerto Princesa.
* **B: ኣብ ፓላዋን እዩ ተሰሪቱ** (It is located in Palawan) - The passage indicates it was *traveling* to Palawan, not that it was already there.
* **D: ኣብ ሻብዓይ መርከብ ሓይሊ ባሕሪ ኣመሪካ እያ ትምደብ** (It is assigned to the 7th Fleet of the US Navy) - While the passage *mentions* the 7th Fleet, it doesn't say *this particular ship* is assigned to it. It says the fleet's commander is based in Japan.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **C: ኣኽራን ዝበዝሖ መሬት (Dusty terrain)** - This isn't mentioned as a cause.
* **D: ሕማቕ ኩነታት ኣየር (Bad weather)** -  While the passage mentions bad climate, the specific cause identified is *wind*.

* **ዘይምቹ (Unfavorable)** directly reflects the idea of a bad or rough terrain/environment that makes landing difficult.
* **ተጻባኢ (Opposing)** doesn't relate to the physical conditions of the terrain.
* **ጥምረት (Complexity)** might describe a situation but not the terrain itself.
* **ኣኽራናዊ (Volcanic)** specifies a type of terrain which is not mentioned in the text.

Here's why:

The passage states that authorities hope the dam will ""help in the underwater spawning of fish"" (translated as ""ተወሳኺ መነባብሮ እንስሳ ዘገዳም""). They believe the calmer water behind the dam will create a suitable environment for fish to breed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሑጻ ናብ ንቡር ምምላስ** - The passage mentions the use of ""nets and cages"" for fish, but doesn't say authorities hope the dam will *help* with a healthy return of fish.
*   **B: ምፍጣር ገማግም ባሕሪ** - While the dam creates a reservoir, the passage focuses on fish breeding, not broader marine creation.
*   **C: ቁጽሪ ናይ ሃምፕባክ ቻብስ ምውሳኽ** - Hampback chub are mentioned as a species that *uses* the dam, but increasing their numbers isn't the authorities' stated hope."

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...ንሱ ድማ ከም ሃምፕባክ ቹብ ዝበሉ ዓሳት የጠቓልል።"" ( ""...and he uses it like Hampback Chubs."") This indicates that the construction of the dam helped the population of Hampback Chubs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሳንድባርስ** - Not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: መነባብሮ እንስሳ ዘገዳም** - The passage mentions these creatures are impacted, but not *helped* by the dam.

* **This directly translates to:**  Deploying teams to multiple countries (Kenya and Ethiopia) to deal with bombs in *specific* locations (the ""indicators"" they're tracking).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Only mentions one country.

* **ማኪስ ትሪያንታፍይሎጳውሎስ** is identified as a journalist who reported on the story. The text doesn't mention him being a lawyer.

Here's why:

The text explicitly mentions judges, lawyers, law professors, and law enforcement officers as being involved in illegal activities that were revealed as a result of the arrests. While lawyers are mentioned multiple times (including Sakis Kehagias and George Nikolaopoulos), the question asks for a group *not* specifically named in the context of being part of the scandal.

ህንዲ ክንደይ ዊኬት ስኢና?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The text states: ""ድሕሪ መራሒ ዊኬት ህንዲ ምጥፍኡ ኢኒንግስ ን ምዉዳእ 7 ዊኬት እናፈትሑ 36 ዙር ጥራሕ ጎዮም.""  This translates to ""After losing their leading wicket, India ended the innings having lost 7 wickets and scored only 36 runs.""

Therefore, India lost **7** wickets."

The text explicitly states that Robin Uthappa scored ""70 runs"" in 41 balls. The other numbers refer to wickets, fours, sixes, or other team statistics, but 70 is the only one that directly represents the runs scored in the innings."

Here's why:

The passage states Adam Kurden expressed frustration *because* of the policy change regarding sexual content. He felt it unfairly targeted Welsh and that the network was listening to complaints about his artwork *because* of the new policy. The other options are elements *related* to the situation, but aren't the core source of his frustration:

* **B: ምድምሳስ ስነ-ጥበብ ዌልስ (Welsh art depiction)** - This is what *triggered* the issue, but not the root cause of his frustration.
* **C: ብዌልስ ዘይምስማዕ (Not listening to Welsh)** - Kurden feels the network *is* listening to complaints, but due to the new policy, it's leading to unwanted action.
* **D: ሓሶታት ብዛዕባ ጠንቂ ምድምሳስ ስነ ጥበብ (Errors about artistic depiction)** - While implied, the main issue isn't errors, but the policy's impact.



"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ካብቲ መርበብ ሓበሬታ እንታይ ተደምሲሱ?,"The correct answer is **B: ጾታዊ ትሕዝቶ (Sexual harassment)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states the passage discusses a policy change regarding ""sexual harassment"" and mentions ""millions of potential victims."" This makes it the central topic of the excerpt.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ስነ ጥበብ (Art):** The text does not discuss art.
*   **C: ናይ ፖሊሲ ረቂቕ (Policy draft):** While a policy *change* is mentioned, the focus is on the *topic* of the policy – sexual harassment – not the draft itself.
*   **D: ብውልቂ ዝውነን ሚድያ (Sensationalist media):** The text mentions media, but doesn't focus on its sensationalism, but rather its coverage of the policy change.

Here's why:

The passage states Amir Khan said he doesn't think women should fight, and that his view would mean he'd support the English competitors at the 2012 London Olympics. This directly implies he *wouldn't* support female fighters, including those competing in the Olympics. Therefore, he wouldn't support English female competitors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣብ ኦሎምፒክ ዝሳተፋ ደቂ ኣንስትዮ ተቓለስቲ ሓዊሱ** - He explicitly stated he doesn't believe women should fight.
*   **C: ናይ ደቂ ኣንስትዮ ርእይቶታት** - He's expressing *his* view, not discussing the views of women.
*   **D: ለንደን ኦሎምፒክ ምትእንጋዳ** - The passage says he would support the English competitors *at* the London Olympics, not that he opposes the games themselves."

Here's why:

* **The passage states Amir Khan feels he wouldn't be able to support female athletes internally.** He expresses a personal view that he doesn't think he could.  This directly relates to his support (or lack thereof) for female athletes.
* The passage highlights he will support the British competitors in the 2012 Olympics, but his initial statement focuses on *female athletes* specifically.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ካብ ኦሎምፒክ 2004 ዝመጹ መሳርሕቱ ተወዳደርቲ (Competitors from the 2004 Olympics):** The passage mentions his experience in the 2004 Olympics, but it's not about supporting *all* competitors from that event.
* **C: ኦሎምፒክ 2012 (2012 Olympics):** He will support the British competitors, but the main point of the quote concerns his view on female athletes.
* **D: ካልኦት ተዓወትቲ ብሩር መዳልያ (Other bronze medal winners):**  The passage only mentions Amir Khan's bronze medal win and doesn't generalize to supporting other bronze medalists.



"

Here's why:

The passage states that Peter Lenz was taken to a local hospital after the accident and *died at the hospital*.  While the accident happened during a race (A) and involved falling off his bike (B), and medical personnel were involved (D), he ultimately died in the hospital.
"

The text explicitly states: ""ካብኡ ዛቬር ዛይት ዝበሃል ድሕሪኡ ዝነበረ ተቐዳዳማይ ድማ ወቕዖ"" which translates to ""He also knocked down another racer named Xavier Zayt."" This clearly identifies Xavier Zayt as another racer.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that fear of flying often comes from a lack of understanding.**  It states that knowing *how* planes work and what to expect during a flight can help alleviate that fear.  
* Option B directly addresses this. If a passenger's anxiety is rooted in the unfamiliarity of the process, then understanding the inner workings of a plane could help.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ተሳፋራይ ብናቶም ፍርሒ እንተተሸቑሪሩ** (If the passenger is generally anxious) - While true for some, the passage specifically focuses on *fear of flying* and how knowledge can address it, not general anxiety.
* **C: እቲ ተሳፋራይ ንኩሉ ዓይነት መጓዓዝያ ኣሉታዊ እንተኾይኑ** (If the passenger is negative towards all forms of transport) -  This is too broad. The passage is about a specific fear – flying.

Here's why:

The passage states that prices can vary significantly across different segments for the same flight and emphasizes the importance of checking the airline's website *and* comparing results. This directly supports the idea of comparing prices from multiple travel companies to find the best deal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ናይ ብዙሓት ናይ ጉዕዞ ኩባንያታት ኣቕርቦት ምድላይ (Using offers from multiple travel companies):** While offers are relevant, the passage focuses on *comparing* the base prices, not just relying on offers.
* **B: ብቐጥታ ምስቲ መንገዲ ኣየር ትኬት ምግዛእ (Buying tickets directly from the airline):** The passage *recommends* checking the airline's website, but also stresses comparing with other sources.

Here's why:

The passage states that prices can vary greatly depending on the segment of the flight and that it's important to compare these results *before* buying a ticket. This directly supports the idea of comparing prices to find the best deal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: መርበብ ሓበሬታ ናይ’ቲ መንገዲ ኣየር ምውካስ (Accessing the airline's information network)** - While accessing the airline's website is mentioned, it's for *seeing* the prices, not the first step to get a good deal.
*   **C: ብቐጥታ ብመንገዲ ኣየር መንገዲ ትኬት ምግዛእ (Buying a ticket directly from the airline)** - The passage actually suggests this isn't always the *best* way to get a cheap ticket.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: እቲ ኩባንያ ናይ ገዛእ ርእሱ ነፈርቲ ክጥቀም ከሎ** - The passage mentions companies having their own freight, but doesn't indicate frustration related to this.
* **C: ነገራት ከም ዝተፈተሸ ሻንጣ ክለኣኹ ከለዉ** -  The passage *mentions* using luggage as a quick method, but doesn't say this causes frustration. It's presented as a workaround, not a problem.
* **D: እቲ ምብጻሕ ብዓቢ ትካል ክካየድ ከሎ** - This isn't discussed in the passage.

Here's why:

The passage (P) emphasizes that while your frequently used airline might *seem* best, you should consider other airlines offering potentially better rewards.  The key is to maximize benefits.  Loyalty programs (and thus, accumulating points) are the core of those benefits.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **A: እቲ ዝበዝሐ ነጥቢ ዘቕርብ መንገዲ ኣየር (The airline that offers the most points):** This is tempting, but doesn't guarantee the *highest loyalty* overall.  A program might offer a large initial bonus, but slower accrual rates.
* **C: እቲ ዝበዝሕ ግዜ እትጓዓዘሉ መንገዲ ኣየር (The airline you travel with most often):** This is what the passage advises *against* blindly sticking with.  You need to *evaluate* alternatives.
* **D: እቲ ተወሳኺ ፍሉይ መሰላት ክውስኽ ዝኽእል መንገዲ ኣየር (The airline that can accommodate special requests):** While useful, this is a secondary consideration compared to maximizing rewards through loyalty.

The question (Q) specifically asks about prioritization *based on the passage’s advice*, and maximizing loyalty (through points) is the central theme. Therefore, option B is the most fitting answer."

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes comparing different airlines within the same alliance.** It states you should consider that airlines you frequently use might *not* always offer the best deals, and that others within the same alliance could be cheaper.
* **Option C** directly reflects this. It suggests looking at your frequently flown airline *within* different alliance partnerships (different ""ጥምረት"" - alliances) to find better point redemption opportunities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Too vague. ""Different combinations of routes"" doesn't focus on the alliance aspect.
* **B:** Refers to sticking with one airline, which the passage advises *against* doing blindly.
* **D:** This suggests looking at different airlines *within* a single alliance, but it doesn't connect to finding better point redemption values – it just states they are different.

The passage explicitly mentions blindness as a potential consequence of excessive alcohol consumption. Therefore, vision is the correct answer.

Illegally made alcohol can contain various hazardous contaminants, like methanol, that can cause blindness and death.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣልኮላዊ መስተ ምስ ሜታኖል ምውሳድ** (Drinking alcohol with methanol) - While methanol is dangerous, the passage focuses on the *risk of it being present in illegally produced alcohol*, not intentional mixing.
* **C: ኣልኮላዊ መስተ ብመጠኑ ምውሳድ** (Drinking alcohol in moderation) - The passage states that even moderate alcohol consumption has risks over time, but it doesn't say this is a primary danger.
* **D: ምስ ዝተፈላለዩ ሰባት ምስታይ** (Drinking with different people) - This isn't mentioned as a danger in the passage.

* **The passage specifically states:** ""ምሉእ ዲስትሪክት ን ብርቂ ባህላውን ታርኻውን ዋጋ ከም ናይ ዩኔስኮ ናይ ዓለም ቅርሲ ቦታ ተሓሲቡ ዝተነደፈ እዩ፣ከምኡ እውን ናይ ናውቲ ዋጋታት ካብቶም ናይታ ሃገር ላዕለዎት ዝበሃሉ እዮ።""  This translates to ""The entire district has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its unique culture and history, and its property prices are among the highest in the country.""  The passage is talking about the Canal District.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ ዝኾነ ቦታ ከም ቅርሲ ዓለም ዩኔስኮ ተባሂሉ ዝተነደፈ (Any place designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site):**  While being a UNESCO site contributes to value, the passage specifies it's *this particular* district that has high prices.
* **C: ካብ ቢነንስታድ ዝተኣልዩ ከባቢታት (Areas adjacent to Binnenstad):** The passage focuses on the whole district, not just areas near Binnenstad.
* **D: ታሪኻዊ ዋጋ ዘለዎም ቦታታት (Places with historical value):**  Historical value is a factor, but the passage highlights *price* as being exceptionally high *in this specific area*.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the canal district was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site ""ን ብርቂ ባህላውን ታርኻውን ዋጋ"" - meaning *because of its rich culture and history*.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ፍሉይ ንብረት እዩ** - While it might be unique, the passage doesn't cite uniqueness as the reason for the UNESCO designation.
*   **C: ኣብ ከባቢ ቢነንስታድ ዝርከብ ቦታ እዩ** -  Its location is mentioned, but not *why* it's a UNESCO site.
*   **D: ልዑል ዋጋ ዘለዎ ንብረት እዩ** - The passage notes high property prices, but this is a *result* of its status, not the reason for it."

Here's why:

The text states: ""ናፍቲ ቤተመቅደስ ንምእታው ናይ ኣንግኮር መጎብነዪ ትኬት የድሊ እዩ"" which translates to ""To visit the temple, an Angkor Pass ticket is required"". This means having an Angkor Pass is a necessary cost/requirement to experience Phnom Krom.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብ ልዕሊ ቶንሌ ሳፕ ዝረአ ትርኢት (The view over Tonle Sap):** While the text mentions the view, it doesn't state it has a cost associated with it.
* **C: ሲም ሪፕ ምርኣይ (Seeing Siem Reap):** The text only states Phrom Krom's distance *from* Siem Reap; there's no cost mentioned for visiting Siem Reap itself.
* **D: እቲ ብጃልባ ናብ ቀላይ ዝግበር ጉዕዞ (The journey made by boat to the top):** The text only notes that the journey can be tiring, not that it costs anything.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ሰፊሕ ናይ መገሻ ባጀት (Large travel budget):** While Antarctica trips are expensive, the passage doesn't say a budget prevents travel. It focuses on physical requirements.
* **B: ንሮዝ ሲ ንምድህሳስ ብሕታዊ ተገዳስነት (Willingness to sail on the Ross Sea):**  The passage mentions the Ross Sea as a location visited, but doesn't state a willingness to sail there is a barrier.
* **C: ኣብ ታሕሳስን ጥርን ንምጕዓዝ ዘኽእል መደብ ስራሕ (A job allowing travel in December-February):** The passage mentions this is the prime tourist season, but doesn't say having a job that *doesn't* allow this travel prevents you from going.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ብቐሊሉ ኣብ ዝረኽበሉ ቦታ (wherever it is easily accessible)** - The passage specifically says they aren't usually in easily accessible places (like cities).
*   **B: ኣብ ማእከል ከተማ (in the city center)** - The passage explicitly states that observatories are *not* usually in cities.
*   **D: ኣብ ሓደ ቀጽሪ ኮለጅ (on a college campus)** - While some colleges have observatories, the passage focuses on the need for optimal atmospheric conditions, which are usually found away from urban areas and colleges.

* **Observatories** are specifically designed and located in rural areas with clear skies for optimal telescope operation.

* **A: ኣብ ሙዝየም (in a museum):** The passage says historical telescopes are often found in museums, not modern research telescopes.
* **B: ኣብ ሓደ ቀጽሪ ዩኒቨርሲቲ (at a university campus):** While universities *use* telescopes, the passage emphasizes the need for remote, clear locations for *research* telescopes.
* **C: ኣብ ሓደ ናይ ትምህርቲ ቦታ (in a learning center):**  Similar to universities, learning centers are not ideal locations for large-scale research telescopes due to light pollution and atmospheric conditions.

Here's why:

The text states the Northern Beaches (in the North Shore district) extend *to* Devonport in the south.  It also describes the beaches as having ""high shelter and a calmer inner harbor."" Since Devonport is at the southern end of this stretch of beaches and characterized as having a calmer harbor, it's reasonable to infer that conditions for swimming are more protected (less rough) there compared to more exposed areas.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: North Shore district:** The text describes this as the *starting point* of the beaches, not a particularly sheltered area.
*   **C: Central Auckland:** The text mentions Mission Bay and St Heliers as beaches in Central Auckland, but doesn’t suggest they are particularly sheltered.
*   **D: Long Bay:** Long Bay isn't mentioned in the text.

Here's why:

* **The prompt emphasizes respect, dignity, and avoiding trivialization.** It explicitly asks to *not* mention the Holocaust or Nazis, and to avoid defacing the place with additions like paint or carvings.  This strongly indicates the best response is a personal, respectful, and internal acknowledgement.
* **The prompt describes a place of immense suffering and loss.**  ""Heartfelt remembrance"" is the most appropriate way to honor that.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ ከባቢ እቲ ቦታ ኣብ ገለ ቦታ ምልክት ምግዳፍ (Marking a spot near the place)** - This introduces a physical alteration, which the prompt *specifically* asks to avoid.
* **C: ቀልዲ ምግባር (Making fun of it)** -  This is the *opposite* of what the prompt requests.
* **D: ንሓደ መዋቕር ምጽሕታር (Reciting a poem)** - While a poem *could* be respectful, it's not the core, immediate response requested. The prompt asks about what the place evokes *while you are there*.  Internal remembrance is a more direct answer.

ካብዚኦም ንቋንቋታት ሊንጉዋ ፍራንካስ ዝገልጽ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ዝተሃንጸ (zitehanse)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ሓገዝቲ ቋንቋታት ... ዝተሃንጹ ቋንቋታት እዮም።"" (Language assistants are ... learned languages.) and ""ካብ'ቲ ... ኣብ መንጎ ተዛረብቲ ካልኦት ቋንቋታት ዓብላሊ ዝኾነ ሊንጓ ፍራንካ ቋንቋ ዝተፈለዩ እዮ።"" (They are distinguished from *lingua franca* languages which have become common among speakers of other languages for one reason or another.)

* **The question asks:** Which of these describes *lingua francas*?

The passage directly links *lingua francas* to being *learned* languages, as opposed to naturally occurring ones.  Therefore, ""ዝተሃንጸ"" (learned) is the correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ሰብ ሰራሕ (seb serah):** This means ""human work"" and is irrelevant.
* **B: ዘይተፈጥሮኣዊ (zeytefetroawi):** This means ""unnatural"" which isn't the primary characteristic described. While *lingua francas* may not arise ""naturally"" in the sense of being a native language, the passage focuses on *how* they are acquired - through learning.
* **D: ኦርጋኒክ (organic):**  This doesn't fit the context of language acquisition or the description in the passage."

Here's why:

* **P** describes language facilitators as people who know languages to *help* those who have difficulty communicating.  It also mentions lingua francas as languages that bridge gaps between speakers of other languages.  The key is they *enable* communication.
* **Option A** accurately reflects this role: facilitating connection and understanding *when other means of communication are unavailable*. It describes them as using ""organic languages"" to bridge gaps.
* **Option B** is too broad. While language facilitators *use* natural and learned languages, this doesn't define their *function*.
* **Option C** focuses on the difficulty of communication, but doesn't describe the role of the facilitator in *solving* that difficulty.
* **Option D** describes how lingua francas *are formed*, but it doesn't explain what language facilitators *do*.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ተሳፈርቲ መርከብ ቪዛ ክረኽቡ ኣይፍቀደሎምን"" (Ship passengers are not allowed to obtain visas).  Therefore, the requirement for passengers is to have/meet the visa requirements.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ካቢን ዝርከበሉ ቦታ** - The passage doesn't mention anything about cabin reservations.
*   **C: እቲ ውዕላት** - While the passage says the agreement can be seen, it doesn’t state the passengers *need* the agreement.
*   **D: ኣብ ከተማ ዘሕለፍዎ መጠን ግዜ** - The passage mentions the length of time in St. Petersburg, but doesn’t state it is a requirement for passengers.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ተሳፈርቲ መርከብ ቪዛ ክረኽቡ ኣይፍቀደሎምን።"" (Ship passengers are not allowed to obtain visas.)  This means if someone is on a cruise, they are exempt from needing a visa, which is what the question asks about.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብ ከተማ ዝሓልፍ ግዜ (Time spent in the city):** The passage mentions the time in the city being included, not that passengers are exempt from it.
* **B: ብበረድ ምሕላፍ (Cold exposure):** The passage warns about cold exposure but doesn't say passengers are exempt from it.
* **D: ሴንት ፒተርስበርግ (St. Petersburg):** The passage states the cruise *visits* St. Petersburg, but doesn’t indicate passengers are exempt from something *related to* the city itself.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ይኹን እምበር ብሕጊ ከም ፍሉጥ ናይ መጀመርያ ቋንቋኦም ተጌሩ ዝተተሓዘ ስለዝኾነ ኩሎም ምልክታት ብካታላን ይስየሙ።"" (However, because it is legally established as their first official language, all signs are written in Catalan.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ካብ ስጳንኛ ንላዕሊ ብሰፊሑ ስለ ዝርዳእ** (Because it is more widely spoken than Spanish) - The passage says a large portion *understand* Catalan, and everyone speaks Spanish.  It doesn't say Catalan is more widely spoken.
* **C: ኣብ ባርሴሎና ተመራጺ ቋንቋ ስለ ዝኾነ** (Because it is the dominant language in Barcelona) - While it's implied Catalan is strong, the passage focuses on its *official* status.
* **D: ኣብ ሜትሮን ካልኦት ህዝባዊ መሳለጥያታትን መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ ቋንቋ ካታላን ዝዛረቡ ዜጋታት ይበጽሑ** (Because most of the citizens who use the metro and other public transport speak Catalan) - The passage doesn't specifically state this as the reason for prioritizing Catalan in signage.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ኩሎም ምልክታት ብካታላን ይስየሙ"" which translates to ""All signs are written in Catalan."" This directly answers the question about the primary language used for signage in the Barcelona metro system.

While the system *also* uses other languages through automated systems, Catalan is the language used for all main signs.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that upscale restaurants and cafes are *becoming* more like each other, offering primarily food and drink. It contrasts this with older establishments that offered a more diverse experience beyond just the meal (historical buildings, massages, etc.). 

The question asks what a higher-level establishment *cannot* easily offer to prioritize food and drink. A variety of food options is inherent to a restaurant or cafe; it's the *core* offering.  The other options (unique historical buildings, well-located spots, fast WiFi) are *extras* that can be sacrificed to focus on streamlining the food and drink service.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ፍሉይ ጥንታዊ ዘቤት ኣቑሑት ገዛ (Unique historical building features)** -  The passage specifically mentions historical buildings as something older establishments *had* that newer ones might not.
*   **C: ኣብ ደገ ዝርከብ ብግቡእ እተዓቀበ ቦታ (A well-located, properly equipped space)** - Location and equipment are important for *any* establishment, not things that would be given up to prioritize food and drink.
*   **D: ቅልጡፍ ዋይፋይ (Fast WiFi)** - WiFi is an added convenience, not a fundamental part of the dining experience.

Here's why:

The passage contrasts modern, standardized hotel offerings (like identical rooms and food) with the appeal of more traditional, unique accommodations. It specifically mentions that ""ቁርሲ ምናልባት ወቕታዊ ናይቲ ክልል ብርሃናት ወይ ናይቶም ኣጋይሽ ፍሉይ ምግቢ የካትት"" (cuisine might include local specialties or unique dishes of the area).  This highlights the importance of *local* and *different* food options as a key distinguishing factor between the two.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ዘመናዊ ዲኮር (Modern decor)** - The passage doesn't focus on decor as the main differentiator. It's about the *experience* – particularly the food and the building's character.
* **C: ላዕለዋይ ደረጃ ዓራት (High-end dining)** - The passage focuses on the *uniqueness* of the food, not necessarily its luxuriousness.
* **D: ካብ ውሽጢ ዓዲ ዝመጽእ መግብን መስተን (Food and drinks from within the city)** - While using local ingredients is implied, the focus is on the *variety* and *specificity* of regional cuisine, not just its origin within a city.

*   **C: ናይ ክራማት ኦሎምፒካት** - The passage doesn’t mention Beijing hosting cross-country skiing events.

This directly identifies those involved in raising poultry as having a higher risk of contracting the disease.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: ሓለውቲ ኣዕዋፍ (Wild birds)**: While the text mentions wild birds being *affected* by the disease, it doesn't say they are at the highest risk of *contracting* it. They are more of a recipient of the spread.
*   **B: አብ ምርባሕ መጥበውቲ እንስሳታት ምስ ዝተዋፈሩ ሰባት (People involved in raising livestock)**: The text specifically focuses on *poultry* (ደርሁ), not all livestock.
*   **D: ቅድሚ ሕጂ በቲ ሕማም ዝተለኽፉ ሰባት (People who have been infected with the disease before)**: The text doesn’t mention any increased risk for those previously infected.

This directly answers the question about a type of vehicle where passports might be held for safekeeping.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣውሮፕላን (Airplanes):** The passage mentions immigration checks *after* disembarking from a plane, but not passport holding *during* the journey.
*   **C: መርከብ (Ships):**  Similar to airplanes, the passage mentions checks after arrival, not during the voyage.
*   **D: ሃገር መቋረጽቲ ባቡራት (Cross-country trains):** While the passage mentions cross-country train checks, it's specifically the *overnight* trains where passport holding is discussed."

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions that many German pastries contain almonds (""ብዙሓት ናይ ጀርመን መሰንከቲ ምህርትታት ከምኡ እውን ለውዝ"").  Someone with a severe almond allergy would need to avoid these pastries to prevent a dangerous reaction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ዝማዕበለ ምቁር መግቢ ዝመርጽ ሰብ (Someone who prefers savory food):** The text focuses on sweet pastries, so a preference for savory food wouldn't make someone avoid them due to health reasons.
*   **C: ቸኮሌት ዘይፈቱ ሰብ (Someone who doesn't like chocolate):** Chocolate isn't a primary ingredient mentioned as being common in these pastries.
*   **D: ካብ ጥዑም መኣዛታት ንምቁር መኣዛታት ዝመርጽ ሰብ (Someone who prefers unsweetened flavors):**  Again, these are sweet pastries. A preference for less sweet things wouldn't necessarily make someone *avoid* them.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ቱፋሕ ዓመት ሙሉእ ምስ ቅጫ ተሓዊሱ ምስርሑ..."" which translates to ""Apples are harvested all year round with pears..."" This clearly indicates that apples are a key ingredient/fruit associated with German plum cake.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ሃዘል (Hazelnut):** While hazelnuts are mentioned as one of the many German plum cake ingredients, they aren't the defining fruit.
*   **C: ፕላም (Plum):** The text refers to plums being preserved in rum, but the cake itself is described as plum *cake* and made *with* apples.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that those who travel on a tight budget are willing to sacrifice comfort, time, and the ability to acquire possessions. This directly contradicts maintaining a high level of comfort.  The goal is *minimizing* expenses, often *at the expense of* comfort.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብ እዋን መገሻታትኩም ክትገብሩዎም እትኽእሉ ፍሉይ ስራሕ ድለዩ** (Different jobs you can do during your travels) - This is related to *earning* money while traveling, not the philosophy of budget travel itself.
* **C: ንሰባት ገንዘብ ምሕታት** (Giving money to people) - This is philanthropy, not a core principle of budget travel.
* **D: ከም መግብን መንበሪን ዝኣመሰሉ ወጻኢታት ምንካይ** (Avoiding expenses like food and furniture) - This is a *result* of budgeting, not the underlying principle. The principle is willingness to sacrifice, and this is one example of that sacrifice.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that those willing to reduce their comforts, time, and possessions to nothing are the ones who should choose travel with a very tight budget.  The other options don't align with this key idea.

* **B:** Doesn't directly relate to budget constraints.
* **C:** Relates to *how* someone travels, not *if* they can afford to.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the speed limits are often low (35-40 mph) and enforcing them is strict.** This contradicts the idea that speed limits are readily observed.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the passage:

* **A: ነዊሕ ዝርግሐ ዘለዎ ርሑቕ ገጠር ጽርግያ ኣሎ** - The passage mentions ""rolling hills"" and a rural location between Point Marion and Fairmont.
* **B: ናይ ጽርጊያ መስመራት ጽኑዕ እዮም** - The passage describes the road as being riddled with ""tight turns, sharp curves, and steep grades,"" implying distinct lane markings are essential.
* **D: ኣገልግሎት ሞባይል ዛዕባ ክኸውን የብሉን** - The passage explicitly states mobile service is poor compared to other roads, like those in Pennsylvania.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the road is ""studded with treacherous curves and steep inclines"" and requires careful maneuvering due to the slow speed limits (35-40 mph). This means drivers need to be prepared for many curves and quick changes in elevation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣብ ብርቱዕ ትራፊክ ምዕጻው (Dealing with heavy traffic):** While traffic might be present, the passage focuses more on the road's physical challenges than traffic congestion.
*   **B: እኹል ኣገልግሎት ሞባይል ዘይምህላው (Lack of mobile service):** The passage actually states mobile service is *very* spotty, not a lack of it entirely, and it contrasts it favorably with other roads.

The text (P) explicitly states that underwater cave diving (""ብማይ ዘለዎ ውሥጢ ጎቦ ምንስፋፍ"") requires *little* training (""ውሑድ ስልጠና"") to begin.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ናይ ምሕንባስ ዓቕሚ (Breathing ability)** - While important for diving generally, the passage doesn't emphasize this as a unique starting requirement.
*   **B: ዝለዓለ ደረጃ ኣካላዊ ኩነታት (High level of physical fitness)** - The passage suggests a *basic* level of physical fitness is needed, not a ""high level"".
*   **C: ናይ ምዝላል ዓቕሚ (Swimming ability)** - The passage lists swimming as *one of* the skills included, but doesn't present it as the primary thing needed to *start*.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Cave diving requires minimal training but *does* require physical fitness (like being able to swim long distances or climb steep slopes).
* **Option A** directly addresses this need for physical capability.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ ናይ ስኩባ ዳይቪንግ ዝጸንሐ ተመኩሮ (Experience in scuba diving):** While scuba diving experience can be helpful, the passage doesn't make it a primary requirement. Cave diving is different and more demanding.
* **C: ናይ ብማይ ዘለዎ ውሽጢ ጎቦ ምንስፋፍ ዝተዋህበ ምስክር ወረቐት (A certified cave diving certificate):** The passage specifically says it only requires *little* formal training. This implies certification isn't essential for beginning.
* **D: ናይ ምሕንባስ ክእለት (Ability to remain calm):**  Being calm is important, but the text prioritizes *physical* abilities as the initial requirement.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ንሓደ ኣብ መኪንኡ ክዓርፍ ዝሓሰበ ሰብ እንታይ ሓጋዚ ክኾን ይኽእል?,"The correct answer is **C: ዳስ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ኣብ ውሽጢ ንእሽተይ ከተማ ናይ ውልቀ ንብረት ወይ ዝኾነ ዓይነት መጠን ዘለዎ ዳስ ምትካል ብቐሊሉ ዘይተደለየ ትኹረት ክስሕብ ይኽእል።"" (In a small city, finding parking or a space for any size van can be a difficult challenge.) This directly links the idea of using a car for long trips to the potential difficulty of finding parking for a van (ዳስ).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ብዛዕባ ድሩትነት መኪናኹም ጽኑዕ ርድኢት** (A strong understanding of your vehicle's limitations) - While the passage mentions knowing your car's limits, it's not the main problem highlighted.
* **B: ኮፍ መበሊታት ንኽድቅሱ ዝፍቅድ መኪና** (A car that allows you to pack lots of luggage) - The passage implies larger vehicles are being considered, but doesn't focus on luggage capacity as the core issue.
* **D: ክትዓድሩሉ እትኽእሉ ናይ ውልቀ ንብረት** (A storage space you can drive around with) - This is too broad and doesn't directly address the specific challenge mentioned in the text.

Here's why:

The passage states that knowing the limitations of your car (like it being smaller) is important because it might be difficult to park in tight spaces within cities or small areas.  The question asks what people in a car might need to be careful about if they want to remain ""under the radar.""  Larger vehicles (SUVs, minivans) are *more* likely to have difficulty with parking in those spaces, making them more noticeable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ነዊሕ ናይ ጽርግያ ጉዕዞ ምግባር** - The passage mentions long trips, but doesn't link it to needing to be inconspicuous.
*   **C: ኣብ ከተማ ወይ ኣብ ናይ ብሕቲ ንብረት ዳስ ምትካል** - This *is* a challenge mentioned, but it's a consequence of the car size, not the reason for wanting to be discreet.
*   **D: ምስ’ታ ዝጥቀሙላ ዘለዉ መኪና ምልላይ ኣጸቢቕኹም ዘይምፍላጥ** - The passage focuses on *knowing* your car’s limitations, not ignoring them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሮማውያን:** The text mentions Romans as historical users of the port, but not as rebuilders after a disaster.
*   **C: እቶም ስጳኛውያን:** Spanish merchants are mentioned as settling in the city, but not as the ones who rebuilt it after a catastrophe.
*   **D: ፎኒሽያውያን:** Phoenicians are mentioned as ancient users of the port, but not as rebuilders."

Here's why:

The passage states Sintra gained prominence among foreigners *after* Lord Byron praised it, calling it a place of love and bliss.  The other options are places *near* Sintra (Capo da Roca, Fatima), or qualities *of* Sintra (romantic history, Marian apparitions) but not *how* it became popular with visitors.



"
ብኣርመንያ ኣፍልጦ ዘይወሃባ እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ዞባ ናጎርኖ-ካራባኽ**.

Here's why:

The text states that the Nagorno-Karabakh region, predominantly Armenian, declared independence from Azerbaijan in 1994 and formed a new republic *with the support of Armenia*. However, it was **not recognized as an independent state by Armenia itself** (or any other country).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ኩናት ኣንጻር ኣዘራውያን (Conflict with Azerbaijan)** - Armenia *engaged* in conflict with Azerbaijan, it didn't refuse to accept it.
*   **C: ዲፕሎማስያዊ ሞጎታት ኣዘርባጃን (Azerbaijani diplomatic efforts)** -  The text says these were disrupted *by* the conflict, not refused by Armenia.
*   **D: ሓዳስ ሪፓብሊክ (New Republic)** - Armenia *supported* the formation of the new republic, it didn't refuse to accept it.



"

Here's why:

The passage states that the diplomatic disputes in the region *worsened* the relationship between Armenia and Azerbaijan.  This directly indicates that these diplomatic issues are what damaged the connection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብ ኣዘርባጃን ዝነብሩ ኣርመንያውያን (Armenians in Azerbaijan):** While their situation is undoubtedly part of the conflict, the passage doesn't say they *caused* the breakdown of relations.
* **B: ናይ 1994 ኲናት (1994 War):** The war was a *result* of underlying issues, not the direct cause of the worsening relationship described in this specific sentence.
* **D: ዞባ ናጎርኖ-ካራባኽ (Nagorno-Karabakh region):** The region is the *source* of the conflict, but the passage identifies the *diplomatic disputes* *about* the region as the thing worsening relations.

Here's why:

The text states, ""ካብ 2 ንላዕሊ ተሳፈርቲ ምሓዝ ክፍሊት መቕጻዕቲ ኣለዎ"" which translates to ""Having more than 2 passengers incurs an additional fee.""  This directly relates to needing to pay extra when traveling with three people in a taxi in Charlotte.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣብ ካልእ ከባቢ ምንባር (Being in another area)** - The text doesn't mention extra fees based on location.
*   **C: ናብ ኣፕታውን ምኻድ (Going to the airport)** - The text actually mentions increased demand for family options to the airport, but not an additional fee for going *to* the airport.
*   **D: ንስድራቤት ዝምችእ ምዃን (Being suitable for families)** - This is about the *availability* of family-friendly options, not an extra charge."

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ኣብ ዝሓለፉ 20 ዓመታት፣ እቲ ብዝሒ ናይ ንህጻናት ዝሰማማዕ ኣማራጺ ኣብ ኣፕታውን ሻርለት ብዕጽፊታት ዕቤት ኣርእዩ።"" (In the past 20 years, the demand for alternatives to car ownership in Uptown Charlotte has increased sharply.) This directly refers to the increasing popularity and use of ride-sharing (like Uber/Lyft) which affects the costs associated with getting around with family, as families might choose ride-sharing over owning a car. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ታክሲ ምጥቃም (Taxi use)** - The passage explicitly says taxis aren't very useful in Charlotte.
* **C: ካብ ካልኦት ከባቢታት ዝመጹ ነበርቲ (People moving from other areas)** - While the passage mentions people moving for family reasons, it doesn't connect this to ride-sharing costs.
* **D: እታ ከተማ ከተስተማቕራ ምፍታን (City planning)** - The passage doesn't discuss city planning.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ማፑቼ:** The text says the Mapuche lived in central and southern Chile *after* the Incas controlled the north.
* **B: ኣመሪካውያን:** This is too broad a term.
* **C: ኣራውካንያውያን:** This is another name for the Mapuche, and they weren't in control of northern Chile before the Spanish arrived.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣብ 1810 ዘይተፈጸመ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ምምሕዳር መንግስቲ ዘይምህላው ነይሩ**.

Here's why:

The passage states that even though Chile declared independence in 1810, it didn't have its own governing government for about two years due to the Napoleonic Wars. This means they didn't fully *exercise* governance during that time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ቺሊ ኣብ ልዕሊ ስጳኛውያን ዓወት ኣመዝጊባ** - The passage states Chile didn't achieve full victory over Spain until 1818.
*   **C: ውግኣት ናፖሊዮን ይካየዱ ነይሮም** - The passage explicitly mentions the Napoleonic Wars were occurring.
*   **D: ቺሊ ናጽነታ ኣዊጃ** -  Chile *declared* its independence in 1810, but it wasn't fully independent until 1818."

Therefore, the only ways to reach the villages are by train or boat.

Therefore, ""Cinque Terre"" refers to five villages.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ተወሳኺ መሐርፈፊ መሳርሒ...ኣብ'ቲ ታኮ ጥራሕ ወይ'ውን ታኮን ሶላን ዝግበር..."" which means additional traction devices can be used with most shoes and boots for icy conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ጸቢብ ብራኸ ወይ ሂል ዘለዎ ጫማ (Shoes with smooth soles or heels)** - The passage specifically warns against smooth soles, as they are slippery on ice.
*   **C: ልዑል ብርኪ ወይ ሂል ዘለዎ ጫማ (Shoes with high heels)** - High heels would make it *more* difficult to maintain balance on ice.
*   **D: 1/5 ኢንች ዕምቆት ዘለዎ ቅርጺ ዘይብሉ ጫማ (Shoes without a tread depth of 1/5 inch)** - The passage states a tread depth of at least 5mm (1/5 inch) is important for grip.

Here's why:

The passage states that salt (ካልሺየም ክሎራይድ), sand, and gravel are used to *improve* grip on icy surfaces. It explicitly says these are used to *help* with traction.  Water, however, would actually *reduce* traction and make the surface more slippery.

Therefore, water is the substance listed that does *not* help with icy conditions."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ክልቲኦም ብዙሓት ዓበይቲ ሆቴላት ኣለዎም** - The passage specifically mentions Cook Islands *used to* have large hotels, but implies they are no longer common.
*   **B: ክልቲኦም መንግስታዊነት የብሎምን** - The passage refers to the Cook Islands as ""deciet nations"" which implies they have some form of government.
*   **D: ክልቲኦም ከተማታት የብሎምን** - The passage states the Cook Islands have no cities. There is nothing stated about Hawaii's cities."

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: ካብ ሃዋይ ዝነኣሰት እያ (It's lower than Hawaii)** - The passage refers to them being thought of as ""Hawaii to the bottom,"" implying they are south of Hawaii.
* **B: ሕብረ-ደሴት (ኣርኪፔላጎ) እየን (It is an archipelago)** - The passage states: ""ኣብ ውሽጡ ኣብ 2.2 ሚልዮን ስኩዌር ኪሜ. ውቅያኖስ ዝተዘርግሑ 15 ደሴታት ዝሓዘ ሕብረ-ደሴት (ኣርኪፔላጎ) እዩ።"" (It is an archipelago of 15 islands stretching over 2.2 million square kilometers of ocean.)
* **D: እታ ደሴታዊት ሃገር ምስ ሃዋይ ተመሳሳሊ ናይ ሰዓት ዞን እዮም ዝጥቀሙ (The island nation uses a similar time zone to Hawaii)** - The passage states: ""ምስ ሃዋይ ብተመሳሳሊ ናይ ሰዓት ዞን ዘለዎም እንትኸውን"" (having a similar time zone to Hawaii).

This directly identifies Sirena as a ranger station that provides more than just basic services - it offers lodging which aligns with providing a different type of camping experience.

The other options are described as camps that *receive* services, but are not described as ranger stations offering different amenities."

Since the question asks where you can obtain a permit if you want to pay with cash, Puerto Yimenez is the only option listed that explicitly states they don't accept credit cards, implying cash payment is possible."

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""የኸዓ ናይ ምሕዃር ምንሽርታት"" (even backcountry excursions) and describes skis suitable for ""ምህዃር ጎቦን"" (backcountry slopes). It also contrasts this with groomed ski trails and emphasizes the need for carrying equipment because you can't easily access these areas by car.  This all points directly to backcountry skiing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ናይ ድሕሪት ስኪንግ (Downhill Skiing):** The passage specifically contrasts this type of skiing with the described backcountry skiing.
* **C: ምሕዃር ጎቦ (Backcountry Slope):** This describes *where* they ski, not *what type* of skiing they do.
* **D: ብስኪንግ ጉዕዞ ምግባር (Ski Touring):**  While related to backcountry skiing, the passage focuses on the type of skiing done *on* the backcountry slopes, not the method of getting there (although it mentions the need to carry equipment for touring).

This directly links firm bindings to being able to ski well, which would allow for greater speed. The other options are irrelevant or contradict the passage:

* **B: ከቢድ ናይ ሑቐ ቦርሳ (Heavy duffel bag):** The passage mentions needing to carry a heavy bag when not skiing, indicating it *hinders* travel.
* **C: ጽቡቕ ኩነታት (Good condition):** While good conditions are helpful, the passage focuses on the *equipment* needed for speed.
* **D: ዝተዳለወ መኪና (Developed car):**  The passage mentions needing a car for long distances, but it doesn't relate to skiing speed.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that people who return to their home country after living abroad often find it difficult to re-adjust to their original culture (""ሓደሓደ እዋን ናብ ናይ ዓዶም ባህልታት ንኽምለሱ ኣዝዩ ይከብዶም።""). It highlights the struggle of letting go of adopted customs and re-integrating into their roots.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ምስ ባህሊ ሓድሽ ቦታ ምልማድ** (Adapting to the culture of a new place) - This describes the initial experience of moving abroad, not the experience of returning home.
*   **B: ትዕግስተኛን ዝርዳእን ምዃን** (Being patient and understanding) - While important for any adjustment, it doesn't specifically address the challenge of *re*-adapting.
*   **C: ናብ ወጻኢ ሃገራት ምጉዓዝ** (Traveling to foreign countries) - This is about going *abroad*, not returning home.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ንኣይ መእተዊ ድንጋጸ ካብ ናይ ባህሊ ድንጋጸ ብዝበለጸ ቀልጢፉ ይመጽእ...ካብኡ ንውሕ ንዝበለ ግዜ ይጸንሕን ከቢድ ክኸውን ይኽእልን እዩ."" (Cultural shock can come quickly from a familiar culture to an unfamiliar one... and can be difficult and prolonged.) This directly links the difficulty of readjustment to the *strength* of the initial cultural shock.  Someone who experienced a significant culture shock is more likely to have a harder time readjusting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ ወጻኢ ሃገር እናነበሩ ቀልጢፎም ዝተመዓራረዩ ገያሾ (Travelers who quickly adapted to life abroad):**  The passage suggests it's harder for those who *didn't* easily adapt, as they are more likely to cling to new habits and find it difficult to return to old ones.
* **C: ገና ኣብ ብርኪ ሕጽኖት ዘለዉ ተጓዓዝቲ (Travelers still in the honeymoon phase):** The honeymoon phase is the initial positive experience of a new culture. The passage discusses the *difficulty of return*, which happens *after* the honeymoon phase.
* **D: ውሑድ ትዕግስቲ ዘለዎም ተጓዓዝቲ (Travelers with little patience):** While patience is helpful, the passage emphasizes the *cultural shock* itself as the main factor, not just the traveler's personality.

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states that people often become victims of moose because they approach them unexpectedly and get too close, putting themselves in danger.  The moose isn't naturally aggressive, but will attack if they feel threatened. Therefore, observing from a distance is the best way to avoid that situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ህላወኦም ሸለል ብምባል (By saying hello to them):**  This is a dangerous suggestion.  Talking to a moose won't prevent an attack if it feels threatened.
*   **B: ኣዝዩ ቀስ ኢልካ ምቕራብ (Approaching very slowly):** Even a slow approach can be perceived as a threat by a moose. 
*   **C: ክህልዎም ዝኽእል ደረጃ ስግኣት ምንካይ (Determining their potential level of aggression):**  It's very difficult and risky to accurately assess a moose's aggression level. Avoiding close contact is much safer.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""ሙስ (ኤልክ እናተብሃለ እውን ይፅዋዕ) ብተፈጥሮ ቁጡዕ ኣይኮነን፣ ግን እንተሰጊእኹም ዓርስኹም ሓልዉ"" - ""Moose (even when they look calm) are not naturally aggressive, but if you approach them, they will attack.""  This means they *don't* naturally act aggressively, and become dangerous when provoked.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ብተፈጥሮኦም ቁጡዓት እንስሳታት እዮም** (They are naturally aggressive animals) - This is the *opposite* of what the passage states.
* **C: ኣብ ቀረባ ብዘለዉ ሰባት ክለዓዓሉ ይኽእሉ እዮም** (They can charge at people who are nearby) -  The passage doesn't say they charge randomly, only when approached.
* **D: ኣድላዪ እንተኾይኑ ንነብሶም ክከላኸሉ እዮም** (They defend themselves if threatened) - While true of many animals, this isn't the *main point* of the passage. The passage emphasizes that people often put themselves in danger by not giving moose space.

The text explicitly states: ""ዋላ እቶም ኣዝዮም ውዑያት ዝበሃሉ በረኻታት ኣብ ለይቲ ኣዝዮም ዝሑላት ክኾኑ ይኽእሉ እዮ። ውሑድ መቐተ-ሰብነት ሙቐት ዝህቡ ክዳውንቲ እንተዘይተኸዲንና ርኡይ ሓደጋ እዩ።"" This translates to: ""Furthermore, those called cold deserts can become very cold at night. It is a serious danger if we don't wear enough warm clothes.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ማይ ዋርዋርታ ከም ዝህልወካ ዝገብር መስትያት ምርኣይ (Seeing mirages that make you think there's water):** While the text mentions mirages, it doesn't say *seeing* them is dangerous. The danger is what happens *after* mistaking them for water.
*   **C: ንሓደ ዋርዋርታ እናተኸታተልካ ጸዓት ምብኻን (Consuming water while following a mirage):** The text warns against drinking water offered by mirages due to potential danger. However, the main danger isn't *following* the mirage, it's the bad water.
*   **D: ንሓደ ዋርዋርታ እናሰዓበ ማይ ምብኻን (Drinking water while thinking about a mirage):** Similar to C, this describes a consequence of the mirage, not the primary hazard.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically mentions** that leaving moisture (like sweat) unreplaced, along with exertion, can be dangerous. This directly relates to the risk of dehydration.
* **The passage discusses:** the dangers of heat exhaustion/stroke, potential for storms, and the importance of replenishing fluids.  All point to the crucial need for water.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ዋርዋርታ (Sweat)** - The passage mentions sweat *as* a potential problem if not replaced, but it isn't the hazard itself.
* **C: ውሑድ ሙቐተ-ሰብነት (Low Self-Awareness)** - While mentioned as contributing to danger, it's not a direct hazard like lack of water.
* **D: ጸሓይ ምንዳድ (Sunburn)** - Though a risk in heat, it's not the primary hazard described in the text's core warning about exertion and fluid loss.

The passage explicitly states that the population of the Taíno people ""decreased drastically"" after the arrival of Europeans, and even provides a shocking estimate of 100,000 Taíno people killed by the Spanish between 1492 and 1498. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሃይቲውያን** - This group is not mentioned as significantly impacted.
*   **B: ካሪቤስ** - While mentioned as an early inhabitant, the text focuses on the Taíno's decline.
*   **D: እቶም ስጳኛውያን** - The Spanish were the *cause* of the population decline, not those affected by it."

The text states: ""ካሪቤ ኣራውካን ዝዛረቡ ኣህዛብ ኮይኖም ኣብ ከባቢ 10,000B.C.E. መጺኦም።"" This directly indicates that the Carib people spoke Arauacan languages.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሃይቲያን:** Haitian is a language spoken in Haiti, which is on the western side of Hispaniola. The text doesn't say the Carib people spoke Haitian.
*   **B: ስጳንኛ:** Spanish came to the island with the Spanish colonizers much later.
*   **C: እንግሊዝኛ:** English wasn't a language associated with the original inhabitants mentioned in the text."

Here's why:

The text states: ""...in 1861 the first competitive skiing club was founded by Norwegians in Australia."" This directly answers the question of who organized competitive skiing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ስኪ ባምስ (Ski Bumps):** This refers to a feature of the terrain, not a group of people.
*   **C: ተቐማጦ በዓቲ (Ancient Skaters):** While the text mentions ancient depictions of people on skis, it doesn't say they organized competitive skiing.

The passage states: ""ናይ ቁልቁል ሸርተት/ስኪዪንግ ከም ስፖርት ብውሕዱ ናብ 17 ክፍለዘመን ዝተጀመረ ኮይኑ..."" which translates to ""Skiing as a sport in itself began in the 17th century..."" 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: መበል 18 ክፍለዘበን** - While a skiing club was founded in 1861, the sport itself started earlier.
* **B: 5000 ቅድሚ ልደተ ክርስቶስ** - This refers to the earliest depictions of people on skis, not the start of skiing *as a sport*.
* **C: 1861** - This is the year a skiing club was founded, not when the sport began.

The passage explicitly states: ""ማዳጋስካር ብሃብቲ እንስሳታት መጺኻ እታ ዝዓበየትን ዓርሳ ዝኸኣለትን ክፍለ ዓለም እያ።"" (Madagascar, thanks to its animal wealth, is the largest and richest part of the world). This directly links the largest island to its biodiversity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ናይ ኣውሮፓዊያን ተፅዕኖ** - The passage mentions European influence, but it doesn't say this is what makes an island larger.
*   **B: እስልምና ሃይማኖት** - Islam's role is mentioned in trade routes, but not island size.
*   **D: ምቾት ዘለዎም መዘናግዒ ቦታታት** - While some islands are described as strategic, this isn't the defining characteristic of the largest island."

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with the passage:

* **A: ምስ ፈረንሳ እተተሓሓዘ ርክብ (Association with France):** The passage explicitly mentions several islands being under French administration.
* **B: ብዙሓት ምቾት ዝመልኦም መዘናግዒ ቦታታት (Many comfortable resort areas):**  The passage refers to them as ""strong maritime transport hubs,"" suggesting tourism and development.

Here's why:

The passage states that the custom described, even though rooted in pre-Christian traditions and agricultural practices, *is* practiced by many traditional churches as a way to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ.  The specific practice mentioned is holding a separate vigil (ፍርቒ ለይቲ) during Lent that culminates in the celebration of Easter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ቀዳም ምሸት ንቑሕ ምዃን (Being clean in the evening):** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **C: ንጉባኤ ናይ ጽድያ ድግስ ምግባር (Holding a righteous assembly):**  While a religious celebration inherently implies righteousness, the passage doesn't specifically mention an assembly or feast of the righteous.
* **D: ጸሓይ ክትበርቕ ምርኣይ (Seeing the sun rise):** This is *part* of the described custom, but it's not the *way* the resurrection is celebrated. It's a characteristic *of* the celebration, not the celebration itself.

Here's why:

The passage states that Cuban citizens are **required** to obtain an entry permit from Ecuador *before* traveling there. This permit needs to be legalised by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and meet certain requirements. The other options are either freedoms *from* needing the permit (D), or requirements related to demonstrating travel plans (C) or passport validity (A), but they aren't the *first* thing a Cuban citizen needs to have to be able to enter Ecuador."

Here's why:

The passage states that high-end branch frames can have two types of problems: ""One, they can become expensive, and the other, they can become more expensive than the entitlements of those coming from abroad."" This directly addresses the situation of costing more for someone from abroad than domestically.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ዓይኒ ምርመራ (Eye exams)** - The passage mentions eye exams being covered by insurance, but doesn't suggest a price difference based on origin.
*   **C: ናይ ምርኣይ ኢንሹረንስ (Vision Insurance)** - Insurance is discussed in relation to eye exams, not as something with varying costs for different nationalities.
*   **D: ምልክት ንግዲ ዘይኮኑ ፍሬማት (Non-branded frames)** - The passage specifically focuses on *high-end* (ላዕለዋይ) frames.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions that ""in such cases, high-level branch managers may have two types of problems... one of them being impoverished, and the other being that legitimate expatriates may have more burdens than their owners.""  This directly relates to insurance not covering costs and creating financial hardship for the expatriates.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ተወሳኺ ምርመራ ዓይኒ ከድሊ ይኽእል እዩ (Additional eye exams may be required):** While the passage mentions eye exams, it doesn't state they are a *hazard* of high-level expatriate assignments.

* **A:** The passage says credit cards *and* British pounds are accepted on remote islands, and US dollars are accepted in Stanley.
* **B:** The passage states US dollars are accepted *in Stanley*, not only in Stanley.
* **C:** The passage explicitly says it's *difficult to exchange* Falkland Islands pounds *outside* the islands, meaning you should exchange before leaving, not that you *have* to.

Here's why:

The passage states that most temple festivals are connected to either the annual temple festival, the bishop's annual celebration, or *another major event associated with the temple*. The passage also describes Haramiz as part of the temple festivals, but doesn't categorize the birth of Haramiz *as* one of the defining connections to the temple celebrations.  It's described *within* them, implying it's a component of the celebrations, not a core type of event that *defines* them.

The other options are explicitly mentioned as types of events around which temple festivals are built.

The text states ""ኬራላን ናይ ቤተ መቕደስ በዓላት ኣዝዮም መሐጎስቲ እዮም፣ ብምዱብ ሰልፊ ዘጌፁ ሓራምዝ..."" This directly links the decorated *harams* (ሓራምዝ) to the temple festivals and being seen with selfies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ካብ መወዳእታ ሕዳር ክሳብ መፋርቕ ግንቦት ኣብ ኩሉ ቦታታት** - The text says this is the *time period* of the festivals, not where to see the *harams*.
* **B: ኣብ ቤተ-መቕደስ** - While the festivals are *at* the temples, the text specifically mentions seeing them *with* selfies.
* **D: ኣብ ጎደናታት ኬራላ** - The text doesn't mention seeing them in the streets of Kerala, only at the temple festivals.

Here's why:

The passage states that initially, securing a cheaper flight is about finding a small amount of savings. It then describes how business or first-class fares are significantly marked up (4x normal economy, 10x for the initial portion).  The passage essentially says looking for deals is the first step, before considering higher classes of service.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ብመንገዲ ኩባንያኩም ወጻኢታት ምግባር (By managing your company's expenses):** While cost management is relevant to travel, the passage doesn't specifically mention company expenses. It focuses on the traveler's tactics.
*   **B: ኣብ ክንዲ ቢዝነስ ቀዳማይ ክላስ ትኬት ምግዛእ (Buying business or first class tickets):** The passage specifically warns *against* this as a way to save money, detailing how much more expensive these options are.
*   **C: ቀጥታዊ ዘይኮነ ቀዳማይ ክላስ በረራ ትኬት ምግዛእ (Buying non-direct first class tickets):** The passage actually states that even finding deals on direct business/first class flights doesn't help, and doesn't mention non-direct flights.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ብሓፈሻዊ ኣዘራርባ፣ ኣብ ካብ A ናብ B ዝኸዱ ቀጥታዊ በረራታት ብዛዕባ ምጉዳል ዋጋ ናይ ቢዝነስ ወይ ቀዳማይ ክላስ ኮፍ መበሊ ምሕታት ምንም ጥቅሚ የብሉን."" This translates to: ""Interestingly, paying for business or first class on direct flights from A to B offers no benefit.""  

This implies that when booking tickets, specifically for direct flights, you *could* waste your money by choosing a higher class of service.  The passage suggests it doesn't provide any extra value in that context.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ቢዝነስ ክላስ (Business Class)** - The passage *doesn't* say business class is a waste of money generally, only on *direct* flights.
*   **C: ቅናሽ ዋጋታት (Discounted Prices)** - The passage doesn't discuss discounted prices.
*   **D: ቀዳማይ ክላስ (First Class)** - Similar to business class, the passage doesn't condemn first class overall, just on *direct* flights.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states to consider ""ተወሳኺ ዋጋታት ናይ ተወሰኽቲ ቪዛታት"" (additional costs of visas) when comparing the total cost of a trip to Africa versus a trip around the world.  It further clarifies this to include both visas *for* Africa and visas for destinations *outside* of Africa that might be part of a round-the-world trip.  Therefore, comparing the two requires accounting for the visa costs specific to entering African countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ወጻኢታት ተወሳኺ ቪዛ ካብ ኣፍሪቃ ወጻኢ ንዝርከቡ ቦታታት** - This is mentioned as something to consider but isn’t what you need to calculate *within* the comparison.
* **B: ኣብ ኣፍሪቃ ቀረጽ ናይ በረራ** - This is a cost that would be included in *both* trip totals, so it doesn't differentiate the costs for comparison.
* **D: ካብ ኣፍሪቃ ወጻኢ ንዝርከቡ ቦታታት ናይ መሬት መጓዕዝያ ወጻኢታት** - This is also a cost that would be included in both trip totals, and it’s not specific to Africa vs. a round-the-world trip.

*   **C: ኣብቲ ቦታ ዝርከቡ ሬስቶራንት (Restaurants located on site):** The passage mentions restaurants as a separate entity, not something supermarkets are expanding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣብቲ ቦታ ዝርከቡ ሬስቶራንት (Restaurants located on site):** The passage mentions restaurants as a separate option, *not* as something supermarkets offer.
*   **B: ውሑድ ዝተፈላለየ ምርጫ (Limited variety):** The passage states ready-to-eat meals at supermarkets have a limited selection, but doesn’t mention this as a convenience.
*   **C: ጥረ መግቢ (Cheap food):** While the passage mentions affordability, it doesn't link this specifically as a convenience provided by the supermarkets.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣየናይ እዩ ፈረንሳይኛ ብዝዛረቡ ቤልጅየማውያንን ስዊዝን ዘይርድእዎ?,"The correct answer is **D: ኣብ ፈረንሳይ ዝዝረብ መብዛሕትኡ ፈረንሳይኛ**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while Belgian and Swiss French have some differences in numerical systems and vocabulary compared to the French spoken in France, *all* speakers of French in Belgium and Switzerland are taught standard French in school and use the standard French number system. This implies that they **understand** the French spoken in France, even if there are subtle variations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: እቲ መደበኛ ስርዓተ ቁጽሪ ፈረንሳይኛ (The standard French number system)** - This is something they *use*, but doesn't address understanding French from France.
*   **B: ፍሉይ ናይ ፈረንሳይኛ ቃላት (Different French vocabulary)** -  Differences in vocabulary could potentially *hinder* understanding, but the passage doesn't say it prevents it.
*   **C: ዝተወሰኑ ኣደማምጻታት ቃላት ፈረንሳይኛ (Certain adaptations of French words)** - Similar to B, adaptations don't necessarily mean a lack of understanding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣደማምጻ ናይ ኩሉ ቃላት (The pronunciation of all words):** The passage mentions ""ኣደማምጻ ናይ ገለ ቃላት ቁሩብ ፍልይ ዝበለ እዩ"" (the pronunciation of some words is closer to different), not all.
*   **C: ኣብ ቤት ትምህርቲ ዝወሃብ ስሩዕ ፈረንሳይኛ (Standard French taught in school):** The passage states they all learn *standard* French in school.
*   **D: ኣጸሓሕፋ ፊደላት ናይ ገሊኡ ቃላት ፈረንሳይኛ (Spelling of some French words):** The passage doesn't mention spelling differences.

The passage explicitly states ""ብኹሉ ኩነታት ብቀጥታ ካብቲ መንገዲ ኣየር ብስልክኻ ክትምዝግቦ ኣለካ"" (you must book directly with the airline by phone in all cases).  Booking through a third-party service would prevent you from accessing the compassionate airfare service.

* **C: ካብ ፓሪስ ናብ ኣመሪካ ብነፋሪት ሉፍታን ትበርር እንተኾይንካ** -  Lufthansa is listed as a possible airline to use, and the origin/destination isn't relevant to eligibility.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ብኹሉ ኩነታት ብቀጥታ ካብቲ መንገዲ ኣየር ብስልክኻ ክትምዝግቦ ኣለካ."" This translates to ""You must contact the airline directly by phone in all cases.""  This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ናይ ቀብሪ ጉዕዞ ወጻኢታት ይሽፍኑ (They cover funeral travel expenses):** The passage talks about *booking* flights for funeral travel, not *covering expenses*.

*   **C: ናይ መወዳእታ ሰዓት መገሻ ዝኸውን ወጻኢታት ይሽፍኑ (They cover last-minute travel expenses):** The passage mentions last-minute travel, but doesn't say the airlines *cover* expenses. It simply offers service for it.

Here's why:

The passage states that GPS apps rely on data connection and may not work offline.  A dedicated GPS device *doesn't* need a data connection to function. Therefore, a dedicated GPS device is more useful when you are **offline (ካብ መስመር ወጻኢ እንተለኻ)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ገንዘብ ክትቁጥብ ኣብ እትፍትነሉ እዋን** - While cost is mentioned, it doesn't determine *when* a dedicated GPS is more useful.
* **B: ዳታ ኮነክሽን ከም ዝህልወካ ምስ ኣረጋገጽካ** - The opposite is true; a dedicated GPS is better when you *don't* have data connection.

Here's why:

The passage states that if you *don't* have a data connection on your phone, or are offline, the GPS app *might not* work. This directly contrasts with a dedicated GPS device which will function even without a data connection.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ገንዘብ ምቑጣብ (Saving money)** - The passage says using a phone app is *cheaper* because you don't need to buy a device, maps, or pay rental fees.
* **C: ካብ ክራይ ምርሓቕ (Avoiding rental fees)** - Again, the passage highlights this as a benefit of using a phone app.
* **D: ሓደሽቲ ካርታታት ምግዛእ ኣየድልን እዩ (It doesn't require buying new maps)** - The passage states you don't need to buy new maps with a phone app.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...it guarantees you more flexibility and/or the chance to connect with the vessel that best matches your preferences.""
* **Option A** directly addresses matching preferences by traveling with a group who share similar interests. This increases the likelihood of being assigned to a vessel catering to those interests.
* **Other options are incorrect:**
    * **B:** Buying tickets at the last minute doesn't guarantee a better match, it actually increases the risk of not getting a space or being stuck with less desirable options.
    * **C:** While using an agent is good advice (mentioned in the passage), it doesn’t *guarantee* a specific vessel.
    * **D:** Buying tickets very early only secures a spot, not a specific vessel aligned with your preferences.  The passage specifically mentions the risk of booking too early when boats are still being finalized.

Here's why:

The passage states that casinos are designed to make people lose track of time (""መሳኹትን ሰዓታትን ብዙሕ ግዘ ኣይርከቡን""). This is a deliberate tactic to keep people gambling. The passage highlights how easily time slips away, leading to increased losses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ብብዝሒ ተፈጥሮኣዊ ብርሃን (By a limited amount of natural light)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about natural light.
*   **B: መተባብዒታት ከም ነጻ ናይ ኮንሰርት ትኬት (Promotions like free concert tickets)** - While casinos may offer promotions, the passage doesn't focus on this.
*   **C: ናይ ናጻ መስተታት (Free drinks)** - The passage mentions free drinks, but states that alcohol impairs judgment, and emphasizes responsible gambling. It doesn't suggest free drinks are a negative in themselves, rather that they contribute to poor decision making.

Therefore, the passage directly identifies losing track of time as a way casinos manipulate customers."

Here's why:

The text states: ""ኮይኑ ግና ምስካር ናይ ምሕሳብ ዓቕሚ የዳኽም፣ ስለዝኾነ ኹሉ ጎበዝ ጠላዕ ተፃዋታይ ጥቅሚ ብንቅሓት ምፅዋት ይፈልጥ እዩ።"" This translates to: ""However, alcohol impairs thinking ability, so every clever gambler knows to be careful with alcohol."" 

This directly implies that a clever gambler should be cautious about drinking *too much* alcohol. The other options are not mentioned as concerns in the text.

The question asks what is *always* written in capital letters, even when central to an idea. The passage directly identifies this as nouns (ኣስማት).

The passage explicitly states that capitalizing all nouns (like ""Sie"") is ""a major way to differentiate between sentences and things.""  This means it helps to *separate* sentences. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ምንባብ (Reading):** The passage says reading is easier, but writing is where the capitalization creates complexity.
*   **C: ምጽሓፍ (Writing):** The passage focuses on *how* capitalization affects writing, not that it makes writing easier. It makes it more complex.

The text explicitly states that the 2002 eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed much of Goma, particularly the city center. It also highlights the ongoing risk posed by the volcano (""...to prevent another eruption from the Nyiragongo volcano destroying the city..."").  Therefore, travelers need to be extra cautious due to the volcano.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **C: ማእከል ከተማ:** The text mentions the city center was *destroyed* by the volcano, implying it's a sensitive area, but the overarching concern is the volcano itself.

* **B: ንተመጣጣኒ ዋጋ ናይ እምባ ጉሬላ መጎብነዪ ጽቡቕ ቦታ’ዩ (It's a good place for cheap guerrilla tourism):** The passage states the guerrilla activity is a *problem* for people, not a tourist attraction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ቀዳማይ ዝመጸ ቀዳማይ ዝግልገለሉ ስርዓት ፍቓድ (First-come, first-served permit system)** - While the passage mentions that coming early helps, it doesn't *define* the system as strictly first-come, first-served. The lottery and specific dates add complexity.
* **B: ፍቓድ ኣብ 1 ጥሪ ጥራይ እዩ ዝወሃብ (Permits are only given on the 1st of the month)** - This is partially true but incomplete. Permits *become available* on the 1st, but they can be requested 4 hours before the start of the month.
* **C: ፍቓድ ብእግሪ ምእታው ብዝቐርብ ሕቶ ጥራይ እዩ ክርከብ ዝኽእል (Permits can only be obtained by submitting a hiking question)** - The passage doesn't state this. It says hiking questions are *related* to the limited spots, but not the sole method of obtaining a permit.

The passage specifically mentions these hotels having ""ሓሪፍ ክፍሊ መመገብን ምሸት ግዜን ድራርን"" (elaborate dining rooms and evening drinks). A cocktail bar fits perfectly into this description as a place for evening drinks and socializing, especially in the context of the luxurious and fashionable atmosphere described.

Let's look at why the other options are less fitting:

* **B: ኣብቲ ቦታ ዝርከብ ምግቢ ዝሽየጠሉ ቤት መግቢ:**  While the hotels have dining rooms, the passage emphasizes *evening drinks* as a significant part of the experience, not just general dining.
* **C: ፍሉጣት ወይ ዝፍለጡ ብጾት ኣጋይሽ:** The passage does mention attracting wealthy people, but the question asks about a *feature* of the hotels, not just the type of clientele.
* **D: ኣብ ቀረባ እዋን ዝተሓደሱ ክፍልታት ምስ ዘመናዊ ምምሕያሻት:** The passage explicitly states these hotels are from a past era (19th or early 20th century) and valued for their *old-fashioned charm* and *lack of modern amenities*. This option is the opposite of what's described.

**Reasoning:**

The passage explicitly states that these hotels were known for ""ሓሪፍ ክፍሊ መመገብን ምሸት ግዜን ድራርን"" (delicious meals and evening entertainment).  Having a renowned chef would directly contribute to the quality of the dining experience, which was a key feature of these historic hotels.

*   **A: ኣብ መላእ እቲ ንብረት ጥንታዊ ኣቑሑት ገዛ ምህላው (Having antique furniture throughout the property):** While the hotels are described as being from a specific era and having a certain aesthetic, the text doesn't specifically mention antique furniture.
*   **C: ናይ ምሸት መዘናግዒ ዝህብ ገዛ (Providing evening entertainment):** While evening entertainment *is* mentioned, it's paired with delicious meals, making the chef/dining experience more central to the description.
*   **D: ንክፍሊ ርትዓዊ ክፍሊት ዘለዎ (Having excellent room service):** The passage focuses on communal spaces (dining rooms, entertainment) and the overall atmosphere, not specifically on individual room service.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage *does* mention that longer hikes require more effort.
* **B:** The passage *does* state that distances can vary, and are often within a day's travel.
* **C:** The passage *does* say that people of average fitness can handle day hikes.

Therefore, option D is the only one that presents a statement not supported by the text, and actually *contradicted* by it."

Here's why:

The passage states, ""...by toddlers and preschool children can easily be accomplished in a single day."" This implies that for these age groups, even a small amount of walking is sufficient for a day's hike.  The passage doesn’t mention the other options directly relating to minimal exertion.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** In Rogaland and Agder, these barren lands are called ""hei"" meaning land with no vegetation. This implies a rough and unforgiving landscape.  The passage also mentions these areas are similar to broad, open areas.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: ፍዮርድ የብሉን (They have fjords):** Fjords are typical of the *western* Norwegian coastline, not the Rogaland and Agder areas described in the text.
    * **C: እቶም ፕላቶታት መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ ምዕሩይ እዮም (The plateaus are mostly flat):** The text implies the opposite – that these lands are barren and likely uneven.
    * **D: መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ ብሄዘር እዮም ዝሽፈኑ (They are mostly covered by heather):** While heather might grow in these areas, the defining characteristic according to the passage is the *lack* of vegetation, not its abundance.  ""Hei"" specifically means land *without* significant growth.

Here's why:

* The text directly describes fjords as leading to ""wide open areas"" and uses the terms ""vidde"" and ""hei"" which both translate to open, boundless, or limitless land. This aligns directly with ""vast open land.""
* **B: ኣግራብ ዝበዝሖ ምድረበዳታት** (Arid deserts) - The text describes lush landscapes with fjords, not deserts.
* **C: ጸዳፍ ወሽመጣትን** (Rocky hillsides) - While fjords might *have* rocky hillsides, they are defined by the open areas they lead to, not just the hills themselves.
* **D: መሬት** (Land) - This is too general. The passage is specifically describing a *type* of land - the open, expansive areas connected to fjords.

Here's why:

The passage states ""እቲ ንበረኽቲ ቦታታት ናይ ጎብነይቲ ወቕቲ ኣብ ናይ ህንዲ ክረምቲ ይመረፅ"" which translates to ""The best time for ski resorts is during the Indian winter."" 

The question asks when one should go to ski resorts.  Therefore, the answer is the Indian winter.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""እቲ ንበረኽቲ ቦታታት ናይ ጎብነይቲ ወቕቲ ኣብ ናይ ህንዲ ክረምቲ ይመረፅ."" (The suitable places for winter tourism are found in the Indian summer.) This directly links the best time to see these phenomena to the Indian summer (which is the winter season in the region).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ብርቱዕ በረድ ኣብ ዝዘንበሉ እዋን (When it's extremely cold):** While cold is mentioned, the passage specifies the Indian summer/winter.
* **B: ኣብ ምሉእ ወቕቲ ናይ በረድ ምንሽርታት ምንቅስቓሳት (During the entire time of ice formations):** This is too broad. The passage focuses on a specific time.
* **D: ኣብ ምሉእ ኣዋርሕ ሓጋይ (Throughout the entire summer):** The passage explicitly states it's during the *Indian* summer, which is winter."

Here's why:

* **The prompt emphasizes building trust and becoming known as a reliable helper.**  This directly translates to building relationships with the captains. They are the key people who can offer opportunities and support.  The goal is to become a trusted ""friend of the boat"" as the prompt states.

Let's look at why the other options are less ideal:

* **A: ኣብ መዐሸጊ መራኽብ ላዕልን ታሕትን ምባል (Shouting on the dock up and down)** - While being visible might help *initially*, it's not about simply making noise. It's about making *connections*.
* **C: ኣገልግሎትኩም ምውዕዋዕ (Advertising your services)** - The prompt suggests a more organic approach, earning trust through helpfulness, not directly selling services.
* **D: ብናጻ ኣብቲ ጃልባ ዝጉዓዙ ብጾታት ሸለል ምባል (Sneaking onto boats for free rides)** - This is unethical and goes against the spirit of building genuine relationships.



Therefore, **B** best captures the core strategy described in the prompt: forming connections with those in power (the captains) through helpfulness and building trust."

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** The role involves offering help, docking boats, guiding them to their berths, and generally interacting with boaters.  This all falls under ""interacting with boaters/sailors"" (ርክብ ምግባር).
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: ኣብ ትሕቲ ራዳር ምጽናሕ (Staying under the radar):** The passage emphasizes *being* helpful and visible, not avoiding attention.
    * **C: ንሰባት ጃልባኦም ኸጽርዩ ኸለዉ ጥራይ ቕረብዎም (Only approaching people when they need help with their boats):**  The passage also mentions proactive behavior like greeting boaters inside the marina.
    * **D: ብናጻ ኣብቲ ጃልባ ዝጉዓዙ ብጾታት ምውጋድ (Fighting with people who are arguing on the docks):** The passage describes a supportive, helpful role, not conflict resolution.

The passage states: ""እቲ ዝገዘፈ ኣካል ከተማዊ ዝማነ ደሴት ሆንግ ኮንግ አብቲ ካብ ወራሪ ዝተመለሰ ሰሜናዊ ገምገም ፅዒቁ ይርከብ። ኢንግሊዛውያን ገዛእቲ ከም ናቶም ዝወሰድዎ ቦታ እዚ እዩ፣ ስለዚ ድማ ናይ'ቲ ቦታ ግዝኣታዊ ታሪኽ እንተደሊኻ፣ እዚ ጽቡቕ መበገሲ ይኸውን እዩ።"" 

This directly translates to: ""The more developed part of Hong Kong Island is located on the northern shore facing the sea. This is the place the British took over, so if you are interested in the colonial history of the place, this is a good place to visit.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኮውሎን ዋተርፍሮንት (Kowloon Waterfront):** The passage suggests going *to* the Kowloon Waterfront *to view* Hong Kong Island, it doesn't state it's where the colonial history is found.
* **C: ማእከል ከተማ ሆንግ ኮንግ (Hong Kong City Center):** While the city center is likely *on* the island, the passage specifically links the colonial history to the northern shore.
* **D: ቪክቶርያ ሃርቦር (Victoria Harbor):**  Victoria Harbor is a geographical feature surrounding the island, not a specific location with historical significance mentioned in the passage.

The passage states: ""ሆንግ ኮንግ ሓድጊ ሰማይ ዘምስላ ናይ ህንፀታት መስርዕ ብ ግሁድ ማያት ቪክቶርያ ሃርቦር ዝተሰርሐ ዘብለጭልጭ ቻርት መታወር እያ ትምሰል።"" This directly translates to ""Hong Kong is like a beautiful chart of sights built on the waters of Victoria Harbour.""  It emphasizes Victoria Harbour as the defining visual feature and the focus of the scenic view.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ሆንግ ኮንግ ፕሮፐር:** This refers to the territory as a whole, not a specific viewpoint.
* **C: ደሴት ሆንግ ኮንግ:** The passage mentions the island but highlights that viewing Hong Kong *from* the island is best done by going to Kowloon, implying it isn't the primary scenic location itself.
* **D: ኮውሎን ዋተርፍሮንት:** While a good viewing point *of* Hong Kong, it's not the feature that *is* the scenic view.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ጸበብቲ መርገጺ (Reins)**: Reins are for controlling the horse, not preventing foot entrapment.
*   **B: ናይ ድሕነት ባር (Safety bar)**: The passage doesn't mention safety bars.
*   **D: ዝዓበየ ምርግጋእ (Greater grip)**: While a better grip is helpful, it doesn't prevent the foot from getting stuck if an accident occurs.

Here's why:

The passage states that all stirrups should be made of a *taco zelowo lmuṣ* (taako zelowo lmuṣ), meaning they should be with a rough and narrow tip. This is specifically mentioned as a safety feature to help prevent accidents. The passage states ""ኩሎም ጋለብቲ ታኮ ዘለዎን ልሙጽን ኣብ ጫፉ ከዓ ሾጣጥ መጋለቢ ጫማ ይገብሩ"" which translates to ""All stirrups should be with rough and narrow iron on the tip to enter a tight-fitting shoe.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ቆርበት (Qorbet)** - This refers to the saddle, not the stirrup itself.
*   **C: ሸኾና (Shekona)** - This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **D: ሰፊሕ ጫፉ (Sefih chafu)** - The text specifically states the stirrup tip should be *narrow*, not wide.

Here's why:

The text states the organization ""connects travelers with local hosts within the cities they visit."" This directly implies opportunities for interaction and meetings with people who live in the area. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ርካሽ በረራታት (Cheap flights)** - The text doesn't mention anything about flight prices.
* **C: ብናይቲ ከባቢ መራሕቲ ዝወሃብ ዑደት (Tours given by local guides)** - While a local host *could* provide a tour, it's not the core focus as described.
* **D: ምስ ካልኦት ኣብ ሓደ ቦታ ዝበጽሑ ተጓዓዝቲ ዝግበር ርክብ (Connections with other travelers who are in the same location)** - While possible, the emphasis is on connecting with *locals*, not other travelers.

Here's why:

The text states the network is ""with local hosts"" and that a list of potential hosts is provided. This directly supports the idea that guests are given contact information for local hosts.

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions families with children being seen frequently, but also states some hostels *do not* allow children in shared rooms. This implies the question is looking for a group that might be restricted from shared rooms. Families with children are the most likely group to be affected by such a restriction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣብ መጀመርታ ዕስራታት ዕድመ ዝርከብ ጋሻ** - The text states many travelers in their 20s are seen, but doesn't indicate they face any restrictions.
*   **B: ንበይኑ ዝጓዓዝ ጋሻ** -  The text doesn’t say anything about solo travelers facing restrictions.
*   **D: ኣብ መፋርቕ ሰላሳታት ዕድመ ዝርከብ ጋሻ** - Similar to A, there's no indication of restrictions for this age group.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ህጻናት ዘለዎም ቤተሰብ ሓልሕሊፉ ዝረኣዩ እዮም"" (Families with children are often seen) and ""ሓድሓደ ሆስቴልስ ኣብ ናይ ግሊ ክፍሊ ይፈቅዱ አዮም"" (Some hostels allow them in family rooms). This directly indicates that families with children are the ones who have the possibility of staying at the hostels, while other groups mentioned aren't specifically mentioned as having access.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage doesn't mention age being a factor in hostel access.
*   **C:** The passage mentions older travelers (""ዕድመ ዕብይ ዝበሉ ተጉዓዝቲ"") but doesn't say they're *more* likely to be accommodated at hostels.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""ኣብ ኣወስትራሊያ ዝርከቡ ቦሜራንግ መብዛሕትኦም ዘይምለሱ እዮም።"" (Most boomerangs in Australia don't return). This directly implies that *not all* boomerangs return, only some.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ብትኽክል እንተተደርብዩ ኩሉ ግዜ ናብ ኢድኩም ክምለስ እዩ** - The passage says learning to throw a returning boomerang takes practice, and mentions factors like wind affect it, meaning it doesn't *always* return.
*   **B: ካብ በጻሕቲ ዓዲ ኣብ ደቂ ዓዲ ዝያዳ ተፈታዊ’ዩ** - The passage doesn't make a comparison between different regions or age groups.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ረኽሲ ዘስዕቡ ባእታታት (vectors)** - While some diseases *are* spread by vectors (like mosquitoes), the passage describes a disease spread through direct contact.
*   **C: ባክቴርያ (bacteria)** - Bacteria are *causes* of some communicable diseases, but not the method of spreading them.

The passage states that governments *want to vaccinate* incoming travelers against many diseases. This directly relates to the idea of preventing contagious diseases. The passage defines a contagious disease as one spread easily from person to person.  Therefore, vaccination is the method to prevent becoming infected with a contagious disease.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ቫይረሳት (Viruses)** - Viruses *cause* contagious diseases, they aren't the preventative measure.
* **C: ባክቴርያ (Bacteria)** - Bacteria also *cause* contagious diseases.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that commercial VPNs are effective at circumventing political restrictions and protecting privacy.**  They route *all* internet traffic, providing a higher level of anonymity than a simple web proxy.
* **Option B directly aligns with this benefit.**  Avoiding censorship and surveillance is the primary reason someone would choose a VPN, especially one described as offering high bandwidth and strong encryption.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: እቲ ተጠቃሚ ንኹሉ ትራፊክ ዳግም መንገዶም ክህቦ ይደሊ** (The user wants all traffic to be rerouted) - While true, it doesn't explain *why* the user would choose a VPN *over* a web proxy.  It's a feature, not the core motivation.
* **C: እቲ ተጠቃሚ ብቐንዱ http ትራፊክ ዳግም መንገዶም ክቕይሩ ይገብርዎ እዮም** (The user specifically wants to reroute http traffic) - Web proxies primarily handle HTTP traffic. The passage says VPNs go beyond that, handling *all* traffic.

The passage explicitly states that VPNs (unlike web proxies) *do* reroute *all* internet traffic.  This directly contradicts the statement in option B that web proxies cannot reroute all web traffic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage says VPNs offer *higher* bandwidth, supporting this statement.
* **C:** The passage implies web proxies have lower quality service.
* **D:** The passage says VPNs reroute more than just HTTP traffic.

* The passage explains how you can use internet calls from remote locations like Alaska or Arizona, bypassing the need for a local number.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ዓለምለኻዊ ቁጽሪ ተሌፎን (International phone number):** While the passage mentions getting a PSTN phone number *with* an international number, it's not the *alternative* to using a local phone company. It's what you need if you want traditional phone service.
* **C: ሳተላይታት (Satellites):** Satellites are mentioned as a *way to access internet* in remote areas, but not as a direct substitute for a phone company.
* **D: PSTN ስልክታት (PSTN phones):** The passage specifically contrasts internet-based calls *with* PSTN phones, stating you *don't* need a PSTN phone if you use internet calls.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ገለ ጻውዒታት ንምቕባል እንታይ ክግበር ከድሊ ይኽእል?,"The correct answer is **A: ዓለምለኻዊ ቁጽሪ ምግዛእ (Purchasing an international phone number)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ብልምዲ፣ PSTN ቴሌፎናት ናባኻ ከደውለን ዘኽእል ዓለምለኻዊ ቁጽሪ ፈሊኻ ክትገዝእ ኣለካ"" (Basically, you need to purchase an international phone number that PSTN telephones can call you on).  This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ ከባቢኹም ዝርከብ ናይ ቴለፎን ትካል ምጥቃም (Using a local telephone company):** The passage emphasizes that you *don't* need a local phone company because internet-based calls aren't tied to your location.
* **C: ካብ ከባቢኹም ቁጽሪ ምውሳድ (Getting a number from your area):**  Similar to B, the passage states you don't need a number tied to your location.
* **D: ናይ PSTN ስልኪ ምግዛእ (Purchasing a PSTN phone):** The passage focuses on needing a number *for* PSTN phones to call, not needing a PSTN phone itself.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ንላዛ ቃላት ጣልያን ብትኽክል ዘይገልጽ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **D: ኣነባበባ መብዛሕትኦም ቃላት ከከምዚ ዝስዕብ ኣድማጺ ይፈላለ**

Here's why:

The passage states that many words are pronounced as they are written in Laz, but it *also* points out that certain letter combinations (like ""si"" and ""gi"") require specific pronunciation rules based on their position. This means the pronunciation isn't *always* straightforward, and can differ from a simple read-as-you-see approach. Therefore, option D is the most accurate reflection of the passage's meaning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ድርብ ኣር ካብ ንጽል ኣር ብዝተፈለየ መንገዲ እዩ ዝንበብ** - The text doesn't focus on the specific difference in the pronunciation of ""dr"" vs. ""ar"".
*   **B: መብዛሕትኦም ቃላት ልክዕ ከም ዝተጻሕፉ እዮም ዝንበቡ** - This is true *to a degree*, but the passage immediately contradicts this by mentioning the rules for ""si"" and ""gi"".
*   **C: ፊደላት ሲ ን ጂ ን ዘለዎም ቃላት ሸወድቲ ክኾኑ ይኽእሉ እዮም** - The passage indicates these letters need *specific rules* applied, not that they are potentially confusing (ሸወድቲ). It's a rule-based pronunciation, not a random one.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""እቲ ናይ መበል 18 ክፍለዘበን ዕዳጋን ዕድመ ዘቁፀሩ ቤተ ክርስቲያናትን..."" (The 18th-century mansions and crumbling churches...). This indicates the presence of historic mansions, a feature that existed *before* the modern era.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሰፋሕቲ መረባታት (Wide squares)** - While present in Izmir, the passage doesn't specifically tie these to a pre-modern period. They could be modern additions.
*   **B: ገፃቶም ቤትሮ ህንፃታት (Facade stone buildings)** - Similar to squares, these don't inherently imply a pre-modern origin.
*   **D: ብቐይሕ ስርሓት ሸኽላ ዝተለበጠ ናሕሲ (Modern shopping centers)** - These are explicitly described as *modern* (""ዘመናዊ ናይ ንግዲ ማእኸላትን"").

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ጥንታዊት ናይ ሰምይርና ከተማ ብዝነበረቶ ኣብዚ ግዜ'ዚ ኣብ ሓደ ዓርሞሸሽ ናይ ባሕሪ ክሳድ መሬት ኣብ ዙርያ ዝተቐመጠት"" (The ancient city of Smyrna was founded in this era on a coastal arm-shaped land surrounded by sea). This means Izmir is *not* on a large, flat plain, but rather on an arm-shaped peninsula.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: እቲ ሃዋህው ንባህላዊ ቱርኪ ዘንጸባርቕ እዩ** (The climate reflects traditional Turkish) - The passage indicates a blend of Turkish and European Mediterranean influences, not solely traditional Turkish.
* **C: ዘመናውያን ማእከላት ዕዳጋን ኣረጊት ኣብያተ ክርስትያናትን ክትረክብ ትኽእሉ ኢኹም** (You can find modern centers and old Christian buildings) - This is explicitly stated in the passage.
* **D: ኣብ ቱርኪ ካልኣይ ዝዓበየ ወደብ እዩ** (It is the second largest port in Turkey) - This is also explicitly stated in the passage.

ሃናሚ ዝብል ቃል ንኣረኣእያ እንታይ እዩ ዘመልክት?,"The correct answer is **A: ዕምባባታት ቸሪ**.

The text explicitly states ""ሓሳብ ቐይሕ ናይ ሓጋይ ዕምበባ ካብ ዝምረፀሉ ካብ ቻይና ዝመፀ እዩ"" which translates to ""The idea originated from China, from admiring cherry blossoms."" and also mentions ""መጀመርታ ቼሪ ዕንባባ ፓርትይ"" meaning ""early cherry blossom viewing"". Therefore, ""Hanami"" relates to cherry blossoms."
ንዕምባባታት ቸሪ ንምርኣይ ዝተወፈዩ ናይ መጀመርታ ድግሳት መን ኣአንጊዱዎም?,"The correct answer is **B: ጃፓናውያን ምልከ-ልዑላን** (Japanese nobility).

Here's why:

The text states that initially, cherry blossom viewing in Japan was limited to the emperor and other members of the imperial court. This means only the Japanese nobility were allowed to enjoy it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ሃጸይ ቻይና (Chinese artists):** The text says the *idea* came from China, not that Chinese artists were the first to view them in Japan.
* **C: ሃጸይ ጃፓን (Japanese artists):** The text doesn't mention artists specifically being the first viewers.
* **D: ቻይናውያን ምልከ-ልዑላን (Chinese nobility):** The question is about who viewed them *in Japan*.

The passage explicitly states: ""ኢየሩሳሌም ካብቶም ውዕይ ዝበሉን ብህዝቢ ዝተጨናነቑ ማእኸላት ዕዳጋ፣ ካፌታትን ቤት መግቢታትን ብተወሳኺ ብዙሕ ታሪኻዊ ፅንዓት ምርምር ሓድግታትን ታሪካዊ ስፍራታት ኣለውዋ።"" This directly links the city's attractiveness to tourists with its many historical sites.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: ሃይማኖታዊ ትርጉም እታ ከተማ** - While the religious significance is mentioned, the passage doesn't specifically state it *hinders* tourism. In fact, it suggests the opposite - that it *attracts* people.
* **B: ከም ርእሰ ከተማ እስራኤል ዘለዋ ደረጃ** -  The passage mentions this, but it’s presented as a contested fact (""ዋላ እኳ ካልኦት ብዙሓት ሃገራትን ዝተሓባበሩ መንግስትታትን ኣፍልጦ እንተዘይሃቡዋ"") not a primary draw for tourists.

Here's why:

* **The passage heavily focuses on Jerusalem's religious and historical significance.** It mentions its importance to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, its ancient history, and its role as a center for faith and culture.  It also touches upon its popularity as a tourist destination with cafes, restaurants and historical sites.
* **The passage explicitly states the political dispute over Jerusalem's status as Israel's capital, noting that many nations don't recognize this claim.** This is a core aspect of the city that is highlighted but not elaborated upon – it's a stated *fact* of the situation, rather than a detailed exploration of the political complexities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: መሳጢ ታሪኽ (Ancient history)** - The passage directly discusses Jerusalem's long and ancient history.
* **C: ሃይማኖታዊ ትርጉም (Religious significance)** - This is a *major* theme throughout the entire text.
* **D: ባህላዊ ቦታታት (Cultural sites)** -  The passage mentions its cultural aspects and sites.

Here's why:

The passage states that a Wild Card can be beneficial for someone who wants to visit *some or all* of South Africa's national parks. This implies that it's *not* worthwhile for someone who only plans to visit Kruger National Park, as the card is more valuable for access to multiple parks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage says the Wild Card *allows* access to many SANParks, so it would benefit someone planning to visit many parks.
*   **C:** Budget concerns aren't addressed in the passage in relation to the Wild Card.
*   **D:** Someone planning to visit Kruger *and* other parks would certainly benefit from a Wild Card.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Kruger National Park is **one of the main attractions** of South Africa and a **major part of SANParks**. This indicates it's *not* the smallest.
*   Options A, B, and D are all explicitly stated or implied within the text.

Let's break down why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: ከም ቀንዲ መስሕብ ደቡብ ኣፍሪቃ ይቑጸር** -  The text directly states ""ሓደ ካብ'ቶም ቀንዲ መስሓብ ቱሪዝም ዝኾኑ ቦታታት ናይ ደቡብ ኣፍሪቃ ኮይኑ"" (one of the main tourist attractions of South Africa).
*   **B: እንስሳታት ዘገዳም ኣብ መንጎ እቲ ኣብ ፓርክ ዝርከቡ ብዙሓት ኢኮዞናት ይፈላለ ኢዩ** - The passage mentions 14 different ecological zones harboring diverse animal species.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ናይ እምኒ ኣስካላታት (Rope ladders):** While mentioned, they are a *help* for climbing, not a hazard.
*   **C: ንእሽቶ በዓቲ (Small bats):** They are mentioned as being present, but pose no danger.
*   **D: ናይ ሓጺን ገመዳት (Sharp rocks):** Although possible, the text specifically warns about dangerous *places* generally (slippery areas) rather than just sharp rocks.

The passage explicitly warns about the dangers of steep sections, especially in narrow areas: ""ሓደጋ ዘለዎ ክኸውን ስለዝኽእል ዓቐብ ኣብ ዝበዝሐሉ ቦታ ክንትስጉሙ ከለኹም ተጠንቀቑ፣ ብፍላይ ኣብ ርሑሳት ቦታታት."" (Be careful not to climb the steep slopes in crowded areas, especially in narrow places, as it could be dangerous).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the passage mentions skilled climbers can ascend quickly, it doesn't directly relate to the physical characteristics of the climb itself.
*   **B:** The passage states that aid from fixed ropes is available in the steeper sections, not throughout the entire climb.
*   **C:** The passage mentions a small, internal path below the cliff, not a necessity to hold on to something overhead.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate reflection of a characteristic of the Machuca Picchu climb highlighted in the text."

The passage explicitly states Majorcan cuisine utilizes bread (bañi), olive oil, and pork (especially cured pork), and mentions cheese (formaggio) and tuna. It doesn't mention ""እኽሊ"" (vegetables/greens) as a core component of Majorcan food in the description provided.

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ስጋ** - The passage specifically mentions pork (and cured pork) as a key ingredient.
*   **B: ባኒ** - Bread (bañi) is clearly identified as a central element.
*   **D: ኣሕምልቲ** - The passage also states ""ብኣሕምልቲ ብስጋ (ብፍላይ ኣብልዕሊ ሓሰማ ስጋ) ኮይኑ"" which means it uses preserved meats.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""the pit is heated by geothermal steam, or from springs, or from other naturally occurring geothermal sources."" It also mentions geothermal cooking pits in Rotorua. Options B (hot springs), C (geothermal heat), and D (geothermal steam) are all explicitly mentioned as ways to heat the pit. However, the passage **does not** mention the use of gas to heat the hangi pit.

Therefore, gas is the one method *not* described as being used."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: መንኵብኩም ምሽፋን (Revealing necks)** - The passage explicitly states the need to *cover* necks (""መንኮበን ክሽፍና ኣለወን"").
* **C: ካብ ገዳም መጠቕለሊ ምልቃሕ (Taking a head covering from the monastery)** - The passage says they *provide* head coverings if needed, not that one brings their own.

The passage details very specific and restrictive clothing rules for women attending a religious event. It emphasizes covering up, avoiding revealing clothing, and the potential for scrutiny.  The question asks what someone *cannot* escape being reprimanded for. A short skirt is the most direct violation of the described dress code.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ሓጺር ስረ (Short trousers):** The passage focuses on women's attire and doesn't mention trousers.
* **C: ስረ (Trousers):**  Again, the passage centers on dresses and coverings for women, not trousers.
* **D: መጠቕለሊ (Accessories):** Accessories are less likely to be a major point of reprimand compared to the length of a skirt.

Here's why:

The passage states that polar regions experience periods of darkness where the sun doesn't rise (""ጸሓይ ካብ ኣድማስ ኣይትወጽን""). This happens during the winter.  The darkness is essential for seeing both the aurora borealis *and* the stars clearly because there's less light pollution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: እቲ ከባቢ ከምቲ ዝድለ ህዝቢ ኣብ ዘይህልወሉ እዋን (when the area has the least population)** - While the passage mentions low population, this isn’t directly linked to *when* the best time to see stars is.
* **C: ኣብ ኣዋርሕ ሓጋይ (in the summer)** - Summer brings long daylight hours, making it difficult to see stars.
* **D: ደረጃ ብከላ ብርሃን ትሑት ኣብ ዝኾነሉ እዋን (when the level of light pollution is low)** - This is true of polar regions generally, but the passage specifically connects optimal star viewing to the *darkness* of winter.

Here's why:

The passage states that a satellite phone *requires* a clear line of sight to the satellite to work. This is the key difference between it and a mobile phone. The other options are either reasons why a satellite phone *would* be useful (B - remote location) or don't affect its functionality (C & D).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣብ ሓንቲ ከተማ ዕረፍቲ እናወሰደ ከሎ** - Satellite phones aren't specifically for use while traveling *in* cities.
*   **B: ኣብ እዋን ናይ ጃልባ ጉዕዞ** - While potentially useful on adventures, the passage doesn't highlight this as the primary reason.
*   **D: እኹል ሽፋን ሞባይል ክህልወኩም ተኽእሎ ኣብ ዝህልወኩም እዋን** - The passage specifically states satellite phones are for when you *don't* have mobile coverage.

The passage states that Transnistria declared itself an independent republic in 1994 but has **not** been recognized by any UN member states. This is a key difference between it and the rest of Moldova.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ቋንቋ** - The passage says that while Romanian is the official language of Moldova, Russian is widely spoken. It doesn't specify a difference in language for Transnistria.
*   **B: ሃይማኖት** - The passage states that Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova, without mentioning a difference in Transnistria.

Here's why:

* **The passage contrasts ""large-scale paintings or graffiti"" (often illegal) with ""street art, murals, and 'legal' interventions.""** The passage explicitly states that street art, murals, and interventions are *not* considered illegal vandalism, but rather a form of artistic expression.
* The question asks for something that is potentially against the law but may be seen as artistic.  Unsanctioned murals fit this description perfectly.  They are painting on public property without permission (potentially illegal) but can be artistic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ፍጻመታት ምጽሓፍ ጽሑፍ (Execution of written texts):**  This isn’t related to visual art or the topic of the passage.
* **B: ስክሪብል (Scribble):** A scribble is typically random and lacks intentional artistic merit, and the passage is about deliberate artistic expressions.
* **D: ዘይንበብ መለለዪታት (Unreadable identifiers):** This is too vague and doesn't connect to the discussion of art and legality.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""መብዛሕቲኦም ተዓደምቲ ናይቲ ፃንሒት ወሳኒ ኽፍሊ ጌሮም ይቖፅርዎ"" (Most attendees consider the camping part to be the essential part of the experience).  This directly indicates that camping on site is a crucial part of the festival experience for many.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ንኣሽቱ ቆልዑ ምምጻእ (Bringing young children):** While some campsites cater to families, it's not presented as the *essential* part of the experience for *most* attendees.
* **C: ሙዚቃ ክሳብ ምሸት ምስ ዝጻወት (Music playing until late):** This is mentioned as a possibility, but not a defining feature for most attendees.

*   **B: ኣብ ንስድራቤታት ዝኸውን ቦታ ምጽናሕ (Reserving space for families):** While the passage *mentions* family-friendly areas, it doesn't make that the first priority for being near the music.

This translates to: ""If you consider the Pueblo people's lifestyle, and you don't go to Albuquerque or Santa Fe, you can't have much of a nightlife in the rural areas of North America.""  The text explicitly links the lack of nightlife to being near Pueblo communities, implying you need to leave those areas to find entertainment.

Here's why:

The passage states that to have a significant nightlife experience (beyond small-town bars), you generally need to go to casinos like those in Albuquerque or Santa Fe. It then specifically contrasts the more limited options in smaller towns with casinos that are a two-hour drive from Albuquerque, emphasizing they are more appealing than the small-town bars. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ ርሑቕ ፑኤብሎ (in a remote Pueblo):** The passage suggests that *getting* to the Pueblos isn't the issue, but that they often don't offer the kind of nightlife sought.
* **C: ኣብ ጥቓ ሳንታፌ ኣብ ዝርከብ ካዚኖ (at a casino near Santa Fe):** While Santa Fe casinos are mentioned, the text specifically highlights the casinos within a two-hour drive of Albuquerque as a better alternative to small-town bars.
* **D: ኣብ ንእሽቶ ከተማ ኣብ ዝርከብ እንዳ መስተ (a bar in a small town):** The passage explicitly states these bars are ""not good places to go for fun"" and lack the excitement of casinos.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ወይኒ ኣውስትራልያ (Australian wine):** The text mentions Australian wine is *good* but doesn't suggest it's budget-friendly.
*   **C: ናይ ውሽጢ ዓዲ ቢራ (Local beer):** The text mentions local beers (""Number One"" and ""Matan"") but doesn't say they are cheaper.
*   **D: ጽማቝ ፍረታት (Framboise smoothies):** The text mentions framboise smoothies are tasty but implies they aren’t necessarily inexpensive (and are only good in flavor, not necessarily in quality).

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states that ""ጥፍጡፍ ጻዕዳ"" is a coffee idea unique to Australians.  This makes it something a server in that area would be familiar with and able to make/discuss.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ሓጺር ጸሊም (Espresso)** - While mentioned, it's a standard coffee type, not unique to the described region.

* **C: ካብ ኒውዚላንድ ዝመጸ ሶቪንዮን ብላንክ (Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand)** -  The passage mentions New Zealand wine, but doesn't imply a server would be specifically asked about *this* particular wine. It just states they have wine from there.

The text states: ""ስፔናዉያን ንሰለስተ ክፍለ ዘመን ዝወድአ መግዛእቲ ጀሚሮምዎ።"" (Spaniards began a three-century rule.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ፕያጉ** - The text mentions Pyagu as a group the Guarani interacted with, not as rulers.
*   **B: ጉይኩሩ** - Similar to Pyagu, they are mentioned as groups interacted with by the Guarani.
*   **C: ጉራኒ** - While the Guarani were a prominent group, the text states they were conquered by the Spanish and did not rule for three centuries.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that in Paris, you need to *act* with sophistication and appear as a ""bien élevé"" person (well-mannered).  It contrasts this with the Persian characterization of being arrogant and unsophisticated. The entire point is about *presentation* and fitting in.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ርእሰ ተኣማንነት ምግዳፍ (Showing confidence)** - While confidence can be good, the passage stresses *how* you present yourself, specifically adopting Parisian manners.
* **C: ትሑት ምዃን (Being humble)** - The passage implies Parisians aren't necessarily described as humble; it's about appearing refined.
* **D: ንደገ ዝጥምት ባህርያት ምርኣይ (Displaying disrespectful characteristics)** -  The passage directly states the Persians are perceived negatively for being arrogant and unsophisticated, which is the opposite of blending in successfully in Paris.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Parisians are described as ""ፉሉጣት...ትዕቢተኛ"" (flawed...arrogant).  The text focuses on the need to *appear* sophisticated and well-mannered to navigate Paris, implying Parisians themselves are perceived as having a sense of superiority (arrogance) that you need to counter with proper etiquette.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ስርዓት ዘይምግባር (Disorderliness):** The passage says they are *zeyesensera'tegna* (disorderly) but suggests *you* need to be orderly to fit in, not that Parisians lack order themselves.
* **C: ተጸዋታይ ምዃን (Being playful):** This isn't mentioned in the passage at all.
* **D: ዘይእሩም ምዃን (Being unemotional):**  This isn't discussed in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ብዙሓት ሰባት የለዉን** - The passage does state MetroPlus is less crowded, but this isn't a defining feature of being the first class.
* **C: ካብ ናይ ሳልሳይ ደረጃ ትኬት ዝወሓደ ወጻኢታት ኣለዎ** - The passage mentions it's more comfortable and less crowded than Metro (third class), but not specifically about different exits.

Here's why:

The passage states that the train has MetroPlus (first class) and Metro (third class) carriages. It also states that each train *has* both MetroPlus and Metro carriages. Therefore, a train in Cape Town will have both first and third class options.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ውሑድ ጽቕጥቕጥ ዘለዎ ናይ ሜትሮ ኮች** - The passage describes MetroPlus as more comfortable but not necessarily fewer carriages.
*   **B: ንኽልቲኡ ደረጃታት ተመሳሳሊ ዋጋ ትኬት** - The passage indicates the classes have different prices (""MetroPlus is cheaper"").

Here's why:

* **The passage states that animals can:** cause allergic reactions, spread diseases (like rabies), and even be dangerous enough to injure or kill humans. 
* **However, the passage does *not* mention animals causing paralysis.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣለርጂ የቖጥዕ (causing allergies):** The passage explicitly says animals can cause allergic reactions.
* **C: ረኽሲ ምዝርጋሕ (spreading rabies):** The passage explicitly mentions rabies as a dangerous disease animals can spread.
* **D: ሓያል መጉዳእቲ የስዕብ (causing serious injuries):** The passage states animals can injure or even kill people.

Therefore, paralysis is the only option the passage does *not* attribute to animal encounters."

The passage states that some phone cards are ""particularly adept at offering competitive calling rates to specific groups of countries."" This directly implies that prepaid phone cards are found and useful in certain countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ኣብ ጣብያታት ባቡር (In train stations):** The passage doesn't mention train stations.
*   **C: ኣብ ኩርናዕ ድኳናት (In convenience stores):** While you *might* find them there, the passage doesn't focus on where to *find* them, but *where they work best*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ብነጻ ቁጽርታት ኣቢሉ (Available with free numbers)** - The passage mentions free phone numbers, but doesn't link this to the cheaper rates.
*   **C: ኣብቲ ናይ ኩርናዕ ድኳን (At the corner store)** - The location of purchase isn't relevant to the rate.
*   **D: ናይ ክፍሊት ቴሌፎን ብምጥቃምን ተወሳኺ ክፍሊት ብምኽፋልን እዩ (It is by calling a toll number and paying additional fees)** - While some phone services work this way, the passage doesn't specify this as how the cheaper rates are achieved.

Here's why:

The passage states the park is ""dominated by beech, spruce, and fir"". It then lists several animals, and specifies that some are ""rare"" or ""not found in many places"". The question asks which of the *trees* is mentioned as being less common. Of the options provided, only beech is described as a dominant tree. The passage doesn't indicate that spruce or fir are rare, only that they are present alongside beech.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically mentions ""ጭዃ ኣንበሳ"" (chihua anbessa)** which translates to **honey badger** as one of the rare animals found in Plitvice Lakes National Park.  It also states these animals are rare and might not be found in many other places.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ቱርኪ (Turkey)** - While birds are mentioned in the passage, a turkey isn't listed as a rare or notable inhabitant.
* **C: ካሶዋሪ (Cassowary)** - Cassowaries are native to Australia and New Guinea, not Europe.
* **D: ካፐርካይሊ (Capercaillie)** - While also a bird and potentially found in Europe, it isn't specifically mentioned as a rare or unique animal in the text.

Here's why:

The passage states the ultimate goal of these campaigns is to make many cuts to their opponents' debts, and everything is about raising money through campaigning. This directly links the regional secret codes to increasing debt for those targeted by the campaigns.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ዲስክ ምቕዳሕ (Disk recording)** - This is mentioned in passing as a method (""playing the tape""), but isn't the *goal* of using the codes.
*   **C: ምክልኻል ሽፍትነት (Improving transparency)** - The passage implies the opposite - secrecy and manipulation.
*   **D: ዘይሕጋዊ ምቕዳሕ (Illegal recording)** - The passage states the codes don't change anything about illegal recording, it's just a method used.

It says, ""ኣብ ልዕሊ ዕዳገኦም ብዙሕ ቁጽጽር ንክገብሩን ኩሉ ብዛዕባ ምሽክርካር ገንዘብ እዩ"" which translates to ""to get more clicks on their websites and all about manipulating money.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ዝያዳ ቁጽጽር ዕዳጋ ንምርካብ ኣድለይቲ እዮም (They are tools to increase website traffic)** - While they *result* in more clicks, the passage states the goal is money manipulation, not just clicks.
*   **B: ዘይሕጋዊ ምቕዳሕ ንኸይፍጠር ይሕግዙ (They help prevent illegal hacking)** - The passage states the opposite, implying their actions are related to hacking and potentially illegal activity.
*   **D: ንሽፍትነት ንምክልኻል ሳሕቲ እዮም ዝሕግዙ (They help to cover up fraud)** - While this could be a consequence, the passage doesn't directly state this is their purpose.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about a process that's often non-standard when entering a country.**  While immigration checks (A) are standard, customs declarations are often more variable depending on what you're bringing.
* **The original passage (P) explicitly mentions customs declarations (""ጉምሩክ ቑፅፅር"") as potentially complicated.** It highlights needing to know what you can and can't bring and declaring anything over legal limits.
* **The other options are less directly related to the scenario presented:**
    * **A: ምፍታሽ ኢሚግሬሽን (Immigration check)** is a standard process.
    * **B: ምዝገባ ኣቑሑት (Registration of belongings)** isn't the main issue the passage raises.
    * **C: ናይ ኣቑሑት ሕጋዊ ገደብ (Legal limit of belongings)** is *related* to customs, but the *process* of declaring is the central topic.



Therefore, the question is asking about the customs declaration process, which aligns directly with the information in the passage."

Here's why:

* **The initial statement (P)** emphasizes the importance of declaring items exceeding legal limits, even if immigration inspection might not always be thorough. This directly relates to the question of what a traveler *needs to know* beforehand.
* The statement warns about customs (ጉምሩክ) and the need to declare exceeding items.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: ናይ ኢሚግሬሽን መፈተሺ ቦታ ክህሉ እንተኾይኑ** (If there are immigration inspection points) - While true, knowing *where* inspections are doesn't address *what* you need to know to avoid issues.
* **C: ቁጽጽር ጉምሩክ ክህሉ እንተኾይኑ** (If there are customs checkpoints) - Similar to A, knowing they exist isn't the core information needed.
* **D: ዝኾነ ሒዝካዮ እትመጽእ ኣቕሓ ዘይፍቀድ እንተኾይኑ** (If there is any prohibited cargo you bring) - This is important, but the primary focus of the initial statement is on *declaring* items above the limit, not just avoiding prohibited items.

Here's why:

The passage states that climbers ""ይርከቡ...እናፈጠሩ"" (climb...creating) new routes based on their ""ዓቕሚታት መንደቑ"" (mental/physical abilities).  This implies they *see* possibilities and use their abilities to figure out routes.  ""ኣረኣእያ"" directly translates to vision, and in this context, refers to the climbers' ability to visualize and create routes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ጫፍ ጎቦ (Cliff)** - This is the physical feature they climb *on*, not what enables them to create routes.
* **C: ጫፋት (Cliffs - plural)** -  Similar to B, it's the location, not the ability.
* **D: መናድቕ (Effort)** - While effort is required, the passage specifically highlights *how* they climb (using their abilities to *see* new routes), not just the effort itself.

This means Star Alliance is the only airline alliance that covers that route, crossing the oceans in the South Pacific.

*   **B: ሳውዝ ፓስፊክ (South Pacific):** This is a region, not an airline.
*   **C: ላታም ዋንዎርልድ (LATAM OneWorld):** The text doesn't mention LATAM OneWorld having routes to cover the specified areas.

Here's why:

The passage states ""ናይ ጎ ራኒኒንግ ቱር ብኣርባዕተ ኣህጉራት ብደርዘን ዝቁጸሩ ናይ ጉያ ኣቁሑት ኣቕረብቲ."" This means Go Running Tours is a major player and is associated with Global Running Tours.

The other options are specific city-based tours *utilized* by Global Running Tours, not the entities *running* them.  Barcelona, Copenhagen, and Prague tours are *examples* of tours offered *through* Global Running Tours, they aren't the overarching companies themselves.

The text states: ""ናይ ጎ ራኒኒንግ ቱር ብኣርባዕተ ኣህጉራት ብደርዘን ዝቁጸሩ ናይ ጉያ ኣቁሑት ኣቕረብቲ።"" This directly translates to ""Go Running Tours has presenters of running tours in dozens of locations across four continents.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 200** - This is the total number of global running organizations, not specifically Go Running Tours' locations.
*   **C: ብዓሰርተታት (In dozens)** - While the text says ""in dozens of locations"", the question asks about the number of *continents*.
*   **D: ሰለስተ (Three)** - This number is not mentioned in the text."

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: ኣብ ናይ እግሪ ጉዕዞ ሳፋሪ ምኻድ** - While a walking safari might *increase* the chance of seeing animals, it doesn't guarantee a clear view of leopards.
* **B: ኣብ ናይ እግሪ ጉዕዞ ቡሽ ምኻድ** -  Same reason as A.
* **D: ማኪና ሒዝኩም ስሩዕ መሳርሒታት ምጥቃም** - A camera is good for capturing images, but doesn't necessarily help with *seeing* the animal clearly in the first place. You need to see it to photograph it!

Here's why:

The text states that gazelles (ቅጭኔ) and lions (ሓርማዝ) have a tendency to approach vehicles slowly, making them good subjects for close-up views. This implies you're more likely to encounter them *while* on a vehicle safari.

The other options are mentioned, but not specifically as animals that approach vehicles:

*   **A: ኣንበሳታት (Lions):** While mentioned, the text doesn't specifically link them to being seen *from* a vehicle.
*   **C: ነብርታት (Leopards):** Similar to lions, the text only mentions seeing them with binoculars (from a distance).
*   **D: ዓርዓር ነብርታት (Cheetahs):** Same as leopards.

The text focuses on gazelles' behavior of approaching cars, making them the most likely animal to be seen by a traveler in a vehicle safari."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ዋጋ ዑደት ዝንኪ እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ብውልቅኹም ምኻድ (By pooling together)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the best way to save money on tolls is to travel with a group of 4-6 people and *share the cost*.  This is what ""pooling together"" refers to – combining resources (money) with others.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣርባዕተ ኣባላት ዝሓቖፈ ጉጅለ ምርካብ (Forming a group of four members)** - While a group of four is *within* the recommended range, the core idea is sharing the toll, not just the group size.
* **C: ምስ ሓደ ካልእ ሰብ ምኻድ (Traveling with just one other person)** - The passage suggests a larger group (4-6) is better for cost savings.
* **D: ሽዱሽተ ወይ ልዕሊኡ ዝሓቖፈ ጉጅለ ምርካብ (Forming a group of twelve or more)** - The passage explicitly says groups larger than 6 may end up costing more because of needing multiple cars.

Here's why:

The passage states that carpooling with others (4-6 people) *can* save money, but it also points out the problem of passengers frequently switching cars to maximize convenience. This switching leads to additional costs. The text implies the best way to avoid those extra costs is to travel with people willing to share a single vehicle throughout the trip – the ""በጻሕቲ"" (passengers) who are willing to carpool and *not* frequently change cars.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ሰለስተ ኣባላት ዝሓቖፈ ጉጅለ (A group of three members):** While a group is good, it doesn't guarantee avoiding the car-switching issue.
*   **C: ብሓባር ዝጓዓዙ ክልተ ኣዕሩኽ (Two companions traveling together):** Too small a group to significantly impact cost savings.
*   **D: ሓሙሽተ ሰባት ዝሓቖፈ ጉጅለ (A group of five people):**  While a good size for carpooling, the passage specifically warns about the issue of switching cars, which this option doesn't address."

The passage states: ""ብተደጋጋሚ ኣብ ሙዚቃ፣ ፊልሚታት፣ ጽሑፋትን ህዝባዊ ባህልታትን ብምርኣያ እታ ኸተማን ፍሉጣት ቦታታታን ብዓለም ክትፍለጥ ጌሩ እዩ።"" (By frequently appearing in music, films, writing and popular culture, the city has been able to promote its unique place in the world.)

* **B: እቲ ላዕለዋይ ደረጃ ዘለዎ ናይ ዓቢ ኣኼባ መሳለጥያታት** (The high-level large conference facilities) - The passage mentions hotels and restaurants as part of tourism, but doesn't specifically highlight conference facilities as a reason for global recognition.
* **C: እቲ ናይ ኢኮኖሚ ብዙሕነት** (The economic diversity) - While the passage *mentions* economic diversity, it doesn't state this is what makes San Francisco globally prominent.
* **D: ኣብ ቀረባ እዋን ዝመጽእ ትርኢት መግቢ ኤስያ** (The recent Asian food exhibition) -  The passage notes the variety of Asian food, but doesn't present this as a key contribution to San Francisco's global reputation.

Here's why:

The text states that San Francisco's economy is *connected* to global tourism, and lists several key sectors like technology, government, finance, trade, and tourism. It doesn't say the economy is *entirely* based on tourism.  It is a significant part, but not the whole picture.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: ኣብ ፊልምታትን መጻሕፍትን ብዙሕ ግዜ ተራእዩ እዩ** - The text explicitly mentions San Francisco frequently appearing in music, films, literature, and popular culture.
*   **B: ናይ ኤስያ ምግቢ ይርከብ እዩ** - The text states San Francisco is a hub for various Asian cuisines (Korean, Thai, Chinese, and Japanese).
*   **C: ብዙሓት ሆቴላትን ማእከላት ኣኼባታትን ኣለዉ** - The text mentions numerous hotels and conference facilities as part of the city's tourism infrastructure."

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ወይ'ውን ንመዓልቦኻ ዝከውን ካልእ ሰነዳት (ቪዛ) ከተምጽእ እንተደሊኻ ቦታ ክሓዝኡልካ ይኽእሉ እዮም።"" ( ""...or if you want to obtain other documents (visa) for your trip, they can reserve them for you."") This implies that travel agents can *assist* with obtaining visas.  However, it also states that problems are more likely to be dealt with by the agent than directly with the hotel.  Therefore, someone *without* a confirmed visa is the type of traveler who would most benefit from an agent's help.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ንውሳነ ዝሽገር ተጓዓዛይ (A last-minute traveler):** The passage doesn't suggest that agents are particularly *unable* to help last-minute travelers, just that they often have package deals.
*   **B: ብቕጽበት ናይ ምኻድ ዝንባለ ዘለዎ ተጓዓዛይ (A traveler eager to depart quickly):**  The text doesn't mention anything about speed of departure.
*   **D: ፓኬጅ ውዕላት ምውሳድ ዝመርጽ ተጓዓዛይ (A traveler who prefers package deals):** The passage *states* that agents often *offer* package deals, so they are well-suited to help this type of traveler, not unable to assist them.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ወይ'ውን ንመዓልቦኻ ዝከውን ካልእ ሰነዳት (ቪዛ) ከተምጽእ እንተደሊኻ ቦታ ክሓዝኡልካ ይኽእሉ እዮም።"" This means travel agents *can* help with travel documents like visas.
* **The passage mentions:**
    * **B: ናይ ሆቴል ውዕላት (Hotel deals):** ""ናይ ጉዕዞ ወኪላት መብዛሕትኡ ግዘ ምስ ውሱናት ሆቴላት ውዕላት ኣለዎ።""
    * **C: ኩሉ ዘጠቓልል ፓኬጃት (All-inclusive packages):** ""ናይ ጉዕዞ ወኪላት ብዙሕ ጊዜ ቁርሲ፣ ናይ መጓዓዝያታት ምድላዋት ካብ/ናብ ኤርፖርት ጥቅልላት ወሲኾም ዋላ ናይ በረራን ሆቴልን ዝሓውስ ጥቅልል የቅርቡ እዮም።""
    * **D: ኣቐዲምካ ቦታ ምሓዝ (Advance booking):** ""ኣቐዲምካ መጓዓዓዚ ምሓዝ ነቲ ተሳፋሪ ናብቲ ዝደልይዎ ቦታ ምስበፅሑ ዝድቕስሉ ቦታ ስለዝረኽቡ ናይ ኣእምሮ ዕረፍቲ ይረኽቡ እዮ።""

Therefore, the passage *doesn't* explicitly state that obtaining quick travel documents is *not* a benefit of using a travel agent; in fact, it says they can help with them.

The text explicitly states: ""ናይ ትርጉም ሞተራት ብዘደንቕ ኩነታት ተመሓይሹ ፣ ከምኡውን ሕጂ ብዙሕ ጊዜ ብዙሕ ወይ ከኣ ዝነኣሰ ሓቀኛ ትርጉማት ይህብ... ግን ሓድ-ሓደ ጌጋታት ሕጂ'ውን ዝተጋገዩ ክኮኑ ስለዝክእሉ ሓድ-ሓደ ተገዳስነት ትኽክል እዩ.""  This translates to ""Translation engines have improved dramatically, and often provide quite accurate translations (and consume a lot of data), but some errors can still occur, so some degree of inaccuracy is to be expected.""  Therefore, 100% accuracy is *not* a feature of these applications.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ምልክታት ናብ ወጻኢ ቋንቋታት ምትርጓም** - The text mentions this as a capability.
*   **B: ምሉእ ክፍልታት ጽሑፍ ምትርጓም** - The text defines these apps as being able to translate ""entire text sections.""
*   **C: ብሞባይል ተሌፎን ኣቢሉ ኣብ ኣቕሑ ዘሎ ጽሑፍ ምትርጓም** - This is also mentioned as a function of the apps.

The text specifically states: ""ናይ'ቲ ኣድልዩካ ዘሎ ቋንቋ ዳታ ድሕሪ ዳውንሎድ ምግባር፣ ዋላ ኦፍላይን ንምትርጓም የኽእለካ"" which translates to ""By downloading the language data you desire, you can even translate offline."" This directly indicates that downloading language data allows for translations to happen *without* internet access.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ዝተመሓየሹ ናይ ትርጉም ሞተራት (Improved translation engines)** - While the text mentions improvements, it doesn't state this *enables* offline translation.
*   **B: ስማርትፎናት (Smartphones)** - Smartphones are the *device* used, but not what *enables* offline translation.
*   **D: ኣብ ናይ ቅጽበታዊ ናይ ጽሑፍ ተርጓሚ ምድብ ዝርከቡ ኣፕሊኬሽናት (Apps in the instant text translator category)** - This is too broad; it's the downloading of the data *within* those apps that allows offline translation.

Here's why:

The passage states that avalanches are triggered by the collapsing nature of accumulated snow. It specifically says, ""قنዲ ጸገም ናይ በረድ ናይ ምጥባቕ ባህሪኡ ኮይኑ"" which translates to ""The main problem with snow is its collapsing nature."" This collapsing nature is what leads to avalanches. The passage also mentions that existing snow helps trigger further avalanches (""ከይዲ ጸሓይ ንበረድ ክተሙቖ ከላ, ሓደ ሓደ ግዜ ተወሳኺ በረድ ይወቅዕ""). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ደቂ ሰባት (People):** While people can *cause* avalanches, they aren't what the snow *is* that makes an avalanche possible. The passage mentions humans as a contributing factor, but not the primary substance.
* **C: ብርሃን ጸሓይ (Sunlight):** Sunlight can *contribute* to avalanches by melting the snow, but it's not the snow itself.
* **D: ተወሳኺ በረድ (Additional snow):** Additional snow can increase the risk, but the issue is the accumulated, unstable snow already present.

The passage states: ""ናይ በረድ መንሸራተቲታት ዘይንቡር ኣይኮነን፤ ቁልቁለት ቦታታት ዝታሓተ ብራኸ ዘለዎን ጥራሕ እዩ ክሕዝ ዝኽእል""  This directly translates to ""Avalanches are not formed by loose snow; only by compacted snow with underlying layers of ice"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ዘይተበገሰ ተጣባቒ በረድ (Unconsolidated, layered snow)** - The passage explicitly states avalanches *don't* form from loose snow.
*   **C: ኣብ ዝታሓተ ብራኸ ዘለዎ ቁልቁለት ቦታታት ልዕሊ ዓቐን በረድ (Compacted snow with layers of ice above loose snow)** - The passage talks about ice *underlying* compacted snow, not *above* it.
*   **D: ብደቂ ሰባት ከይተተንከፈ ዝተረፈ በረድ (Snow left undisturbed by humans)** - While human interaction is mentioned as a factor that can cause avalanches, it isn't a defining characteristic of the snow itself.

Here's why:

* The text states that in parts of South India, coconut milk is used in curry. It also mentions that curry is made with meat or vegetables. Therefore, coconut milk and meat/vegetables are the key components mentioned in relation to curry in the provided text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ርግኦን ማይን** - While the text says some use lentils in curry, it doesn't specifically mention water as a defining ingredient.
* **B: ዕጸዋትን ቀመማትን** - The text doesn't focus on plants as a key element of the curry itself, rather focusing on what goes *in* the curry.
* **D: ኣሕምልትን ጸባን** - While vegetables are mentioned, the text specifically highlights coconut milk as being used in *South* India, making ""ኮኮናት ጸባን ስጋን"" the most accurate answer."

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...in southern Indian parts of the subcontinent, coconut milk is used."" This directly corresponds to the question asking if coconut milk is sometimes used in curries. The passage links coconut milk to the ""siga"" (translated as flesh/meat) when referring to ingredients used in curries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ኣሕምልቲ** (Vegetables) - While vegetables can be *in* a curry, the passage specifically discusses coconut milk.
*   **C: ርግኦ** (Lentils) - Lentils are mentioned, but not in the context of being used in place of coconut milk.
*   **D: ቀመማት** (Spices) - Spices are essential to curries, but the question is about a specific ingredient, coconut milk.

The passage states: ""እዚኣቶም ብጣ/ኦሚ ቀለልቲ ኣይኮኑን፣ ስለዝኮነ ኣውን ኣሰሩ ብትልሙ ክመጽእ ብትራክቲካዊ ጎቦታት ዙርያ ነዊሕ ዙረት ወሲዱ።"" This translates to ""They aren't light with speed, therefore they take a long detour around traditional routes to move slowly."" This directly explains why going through the Transantarctic Mountains is necessary - because the specialized vehicles are slow and need to avoid difficult terrain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ መደበር ማክሙርዶ ዕጹው እዩ (McMurdo Station is usually busy):**  The passage doesn't mention the busyness of McMurdo Station.
*   **B: እቲ ዝተጸቕጠ በረድ ሓደገኛ እዩ (The frozen ice is dangerous):** While the ice is described, the danger isn't the *reason* for the detour. It's the vehicles' limitations.
*   **D: ካብ ብባሕሪ ሮስ ምጉዓዝ ዝቐለለ’ዩ (It's easier to go from the Ross Sea):** The passage states the route is 1600km *from* McMurdo (near the Ross Sea), implying it’s not simply a quicker route.

The passage states: ""ዝተጸቓቐጠ በረድ ኮይኑ ብባንዴራታት ዝተመልአን ምልክት ዝተገብረሉን ጉዳጉዲ ኣለዎ።"" This directly translates to ""It is covered in compacted ice and has markers flagged with flags."" Therefore, flags mark the ice formations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: እቲ ኣብ መደበር ማክሙርዶ ዝርከብ ኣሰር** (The barrier located at McMurdo Sound) - While the traverse *leads* to McMurdo Sound, it isn't what is flagged.

*   **D: ኣብ ዙርያ ኣኽራናት ሓደገኛ ምዝንባላት** (Dangerous crevasses around cliffs) - The passage mentions crevasses as a hazard, but doesn't say they are flagged."

The passage explicitly states: ""ዝተወሰና ሃገራት ንፋልማይ ጥፍኣት ገበን ንልዕሊ 10 ዓመት ማእሰርቲ ወይ ድማ ሞት ዝሓወሰ ብጣዕሚ ዝተጋነነ መቕጻዕቲ ይህባ።"" This directly translates to ""Some countries impose extremely severe penalties for drug trafficking, including more than 10 years of imprisonment or death.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage mentions caution while traveling internationally, but doesn't emphasize it as a key point.
*   **C:** The passage does warn about unknowingly carrying drugs, but doesn't mention *how* they might be hidden in objects.
*   **D:** This is a valid concern raised in the passage, but isn't the specifically mentioned fact that isn't discussed in the passage.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""ብዝተወሰኑ መዘናግዒ ኮሞሜል ሻሂ ይምልኡዎ"" (they fill it with a certain amount of chamomile tea in the evening). This directly links tea to the activity of preparing something at home.  While coffee is also mentioned, tea is presented as part of the ""making"" process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ጽሟቕ (Tsomuqi)** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: ቡን (Bun)** - Coffee is mentioned as something *served* in the house, but not *made* as part of the relaxation/creativity process.
*   **C: ቢራ (Bira)** - Beer isn't mentioned at all.

Here's why:

The passage describes a life where one enjoys coffee in the morning and chamomile tea in the evening, and suggests exploring new things. It specifically mentions that if you live in a city, you should visit pubs you haven't been to before. The question asks what to avoid if the city is full of pubs.  Avoiding frequently visited pubs fits directly with the advice in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ካብ ከባቢኹም ወጻኢ ዝርከባ እንዳ ቡን (Coffee shops outside your area):** The passage mentions coffee, but doesn't advise *avoiding* coffee shops.
* **B: ድኳናት ጽማቝ ወይ ስሙቲ (Small shops or smoothies):** These aren't directly addressed in the passage.
* **D: ሻሂ ካሞሚል ዘዳልዉ ቤት መግቢ (Restaurants serving chamomile tea):** The passage *mentions* chamomile tea, but doesn't suggest avoiding places that serve it.

This financial proof is a requirement for a **student visa (ናይ ተማሃራይ ቪዛ)**.



"

The text explicitly states: ""ብሓፈሻ ካብ ሃንደበታዊ ጎብናዪ ከም ሓደ ናይ ዓለምለኻዊ ተምሃራይ ኮይንካ ምኻድ ብዝሕ ንዝበለ ግዜ ይወስድ።"" (By participating as an international student instead of a regular tourist, it can take a longer time).  It also details the requirements for a student visa and how it differs from tourist or visitor visas. This indicates international students have a specific visa process and therefore, a higher likelihood of needing to apply for a visa.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ስሩዕ በጻሒ (Regular tourist):** The text says tourists *may not* need a visa for short visits to certain countries.
* **B: ወቕታዊ በጻሒ (Visitor):** Similar to tourists, the text mentions visitor visas but contrasts them with student visas.
* **D: ናይ ንግዲ በጻሒ (Business traveler):** The text does not discuss visa requirements for business travelers.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that you should be especially careful of snakes during the rainy season *and* when you see them briefly in front of your car while driving through subtropical forests. The most relevant time to be cautious about snakes, according to the text, is during a drive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣብ ኣዋርሕ ክረምቲ** (During the rainy season): While the passage mentions the rainy season, it's not the *specific* time to be cautious *of snakes* - it's the time you're more likely to encounter them, particularly while driving.
*   **B: ኣብ ጉዕዞ እግሪ** (While hiking): The passage doesn't focus on hiking specifically.
*   **C: ኣብ ዱር** (In the wilderness):  Too general. The passage focuses on a specific situation - seeing a snake near your car.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ጣንጡ ናብ ውሽጢ መኪናኻ ምሳኻ ንኽኣትዋ እኹል ግዜ እዩ"" (It's a good time for the baboon to get into your car while you're taking a few minutes to look ahead).  This implies that leaving the doors open even briefly creates an opportunity for baboons to enter the car.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ እዋን ሓጋይ መኪና ምዝዋር (Driving during the day):** The passage doesn't mention time of day as a factor.
* **C: ኣብ ትሕተ ትሮፒካዊ ከባቢታት ምዝዋር (Driving in subtropical areas):**  The passage mentions subtropical areas as *where* baboons are, not as a way to *avoid* them.
* **D: ኣብ እዋን ናይ እግሪ ጉዕዞ ነታ መኪና ንበይና ምግዳፍ (Leaving the car behind during a hike):** While this might reduce the *risk* of baboons getting into the car, the passage focuses on what to do *while* driving and stopping.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ሳንዳርባናት 3,850 ኪሜ. ስኩዌር ቦታ እንትሽፍኑ ካብዚ እቲ ሲሶ ከዓ ብማይ/ትርኩስ ቦታ ዝተሸፈነ እዩ."" This means the majority is *covered by water/mudflats*, not land.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

* **A: ገለ ካብቶም ዝተረፉ ውሑዳት ሓያላት ጫካታት ዝሓዘ እዩ** - The text mentions ""ተወሰኑ እውን ሓቚፉ ይርከብ"" (some ruins remain) referring to remnants of ancient settlements.
* **C: ኣብ ዓለም እቲ ዝዓበየ ቀበቶ መንገሮቭ እዩ** - The first sentence directly states this: ""ሳንዳርባን ኣብ ዓለም እቲ ዝዓበየ ኣብ ገምገም ባሕሪ ዝቦቅል ዕጥቂ ሾራ እዩ"" (Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world).
* **D: ካብ ነብሪ ቤንጋል ንላዕሊ ንጣብ ዘለዎም ዓገዘት ዝነብሩላ እያ** - The text states there are around 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 deer.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ብግዝኣት ህንዲ ዘሎ ክፋል ዱር ሳንዳርባንስ ሃገራዊ ፓርክ ተባሂሉ ይጽዋዕ."" This directly answers the question of which part of the forest is within Indian territory.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: መዕቆቢ እንስሳ ዘገዳም እዩ** - This describes a function of the Sundarbans, not a physical place within India.
*   **C: ቅርስታት ዓለም** - This refers to the UNESCO World Heritage status, not a specific part of the forest.
*   **D: ሜዳ ጋንገቲክ** - The passage mentions remnants of the Gangetic plains *within* the Sundarbans, but it isn't a part of the forest itself.

Here's why:

The text states: ""መብዛሕትኡ ክፋል ናይቲ ክልል እንግሊዘኛ ተዛራባይ እዩ ዋላ ካልኦት ቡዙሓት ውሱን ፍልጠት ይሃልቦም ብፍላይ ክዓ ኣናእሽቱ ሕብረተሰብ.""  This directly translates to: ""Most of the group are English speakers, while others have limited knowledge, especially the younger generation.""

Therefore, those who speak other languages *in addition* to English are likely to have limited English proficiency.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ብዕድመ ንኣሽቱ ሰባት:** The text mentions younger people having limited English, but it doesn't specifically say that all young people do.
*   **C: ናብ ቶሮንቶ ዝገሹ ሰባት:** The restaurant setting in Toronto is just a detail of where the group is meeting. It doesn't relate to language ability.
*   **D: ብዕድመ ዝዓበዩ ሰባት:**  The text does not link age directly to English language ability (other than mentioning the younger generation).

Here's why:

The passage states: "" በተወሳኺ እውን እዚ ብፍላይ ድማ ትኽክለኛ ኣድራሻታት ንምፅዋዕ ከቢድ እዩ.""  This directly translates to: ""Furthermore, it is especially difficult to provide accurate addresses.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ቃላት ብፍሉይ ላህጃ** (Words with distinct dialects) - While the passage *describes* the use of distinct dialects, it doesn't say providing them is difficult.
* **C: ዝተጻሕፈ ቃላት** (Written words) - The passage actually says written words are *easier* to understand than spoken ones.
* **D: ከባብያዊ ኣርጎት** (Cultural connections) - The passage mentions cultural connections but doesn't state they are difficult to provide.

* This means if someone is going to Jakar, they need to leave between 6:30 and 7:30 *and* book their ticket in advance.  Option A reflects both of these conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:**  The text says buses to Bumthang also leave between 6:30-7:30, but doesn’t indicate the traveler *must* arrive by 7.
* **C:** The text only mentions Paro and Punakha as being served by smaller, quicker buses with cheaper fares.  It doesn’t mention needing to arrive after 11.
* **D:** The text says buses *to* the east leave, but doesn’t specify a required arrival time before 6:20. It just says they depart from 6:30 onward."

* **The passage states:** ""ቲኬትካ ገለ መዓልታት ኣቀዲምካ ምግዛእ እዩ ዝሓሸ"" (It is better to buy your ticket a few days in advance). This directly addresses the question of advice for someone wanting to travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣውቶቡሳት ድሕሪ ሰዓት 8፡30 ጥራይ እየን ዝብገሳ** (Buses only run after 8:30) - The passage says buses start *around* 6:30-7:30, not after 8:30.
* **C: ብዙሓት ኣውቶቡሳት ምሉእ መዓልቲ እየን ዝብገሳ** (Many buses run all day) - While the passage says they *can* run all day, it doesn’t offer this as advice. It’s just a statement of fact.
* **D: ናይ ሓባር ታክሲ እቲ ዝበለጸ በሊሕ መገሻ ክኸውን ይኽእል እዩ** (Shared taxis might be a better option) - The passage mentions taxis as a quick option for *short* distances, but doesn’t suggest them as a generally better option for travelling between districts.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: ካብ ካልእ ክፋል ሃገር ንላዕሊ ናይ ዓረብ ጽልዋ ኣለዎ (It has a significant Arab influence compared to other parts of the country):** The passage says ""እታ ከተማ ካብ ኣፍሪካውያን ንላዕሊ ብዙሓት ናይ ዓረብ ክኢላታት ስለ ዘለውዋ ምስተን ካልኦት ከተማታት እንትነፃፀር ኣዝያ ፍልይ ዝበለት እያ።"" (The city is considered special when compared to other cities because it has many Arab influences more than Africans.)
*   **B: ብድኽነት ዝተሃርመ እዩ (It is afflicted by poverty):** The passage states ""ድኽነት ዝተጎናጸፈት ከተማ እያ።"" (It is a city afflicted by poverty.)
*   **D: ንኽፈልጡ ዝደልዩ በጻሕቲ ዓዲ መስሕብ ኮይኑ ይቕጽል ኣሎ (It continues to be a subject of curiosity for outsiders):** The passage begins by saying it ""ተናፃፃሪ ዘይርሕውነት ዝትሓሓዘ ፣ """"ቲምቡክቱ"""" ን ባዕዳውያንን ርሑቓት ምድርን ተምሳሊያዊት ኮይና ተገልግል ኣላ።"" (Mysterious, ""Timbuktu"" was symbolically presented as a distant land for foreigners.) This suggests it holds a lasting fascination.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: እታ ከተማ ብነፋሪት ክትብጻሕ እትኽእል እያ** - The passage mentions it's becoming a tourism center with an airport, not being accessible by hot air balloon.
* **B: ካብ ድኽነት ንላዕሊ ፍሉይ እዩ** - The passage specifically says Timbuktu *is* a city plagued by poverty (""ድኽነት ዝተጎናጸፈት ከተማ እያ።"").
* **D: እታ ከተማ ድሕሪ ሕጂ በጻሕቲ ኣይትስሕብን** - The passage states it is facing threats from desertification, but doesn't say it will disappear completely. It's listed as endangered, but still exists.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ቅድሚ ናይ 2020 ምድንጓይ መደባት..."" which translates to ""Before the postponement of the 2020 games..."". This indicates that the original plan was for the Olympics to be held in March 2020. While the Paralympics took place in August/September 2021, the question is about the *original* planned date for the Olympics."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ንፋሳት ኣብ ሰዓት ከባቢ 100 ማይልስ ምስ በጽሑ (When winds are around 100 mph):** While strong winds *accompany* tornadoes, the funnel itself is the visible manifestation, not the wind speed.
*   **B: እቶም ዓምድታት ኣየር ክሽክርከሩ ምስ ጀመሩ (When the air columns start to spin):** Spinning air columns are a part of tornado formation, but the funnel is the visible condensed portion.
*   **D: ድሕሪ መሬት ምትንካፍ (After touching the ground):** The funnel is already present *before* touching the ground; it becomes a tornado when it does.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage mentions 100-200 mph winds, it says this is what *strong* tornadoes create, not a defining characteristic of *all* tornadoes.
* **B:** Tornadoes often carry debris, but it's a result of their power, not a defining characteristic.
* **C:** The passage says they become ""funnel clouds"" when they reach the ground, not that they *are* funnels.  The funnel is a visual effect of the condensation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ ውሽጢ ኣማኻሪ ጉዕዞ ካብ ዝቐረቡ ኣረኣእያታት** - The passage says advisors only offer limited, often biased, information.
* **C: ካብ ዜጋታት ናይታ ዝበጽሕዋ ሃገር** - While potentially helpful, the passage doesn’t suggest seeking information from citizens; it focuses on *governmental* advice.
* **D: ካብ ናይ ገዛእ ርእሶም መንግስቲ** - The passage focuses on seeking advice *while abroad*, not from one's own government.

Here's why:

The passage states that advisors only offer limited information about a country's political situation.  It specifically says the information provided is ""hveuḵ, ‘aṭeqālālī kemu’ūsen ni’štey,"" meaning vague, superficial, and brief.  It contrasts this with needing *detailed* information.  Therefore, a foreigner would *not* be able to get in-depth, critical analysis of a country's political situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ዝተጸልወ ናይ ምስራዝ መድሕን (Covered evacuation insurance):** The passage says a traveler *can* access evacuation insurance.
* **C: ዝተጸልወ መድሕን ጥዕና (Covered health insurance):** The passage says a traveler *can* access health insurance.
* **D: ንፖለቲካዊ ኩነታት እታ ሃገር ብዝምልከት ዝርዝር ሓበሬታ (Detailed information about the country's political situation):** The passage explicitly states that this is *not* provided; advisors offer limited information, not detailed analysis.

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agents are most helpful when providing advice for trips to countries with different cultures, languages, or limited familiarity.  This aligns perfectly with a first-time international traveler who would benefit from an agent's experience and guidance.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A:**  A business trip to a familiar city doesn't necessarily require a travel agent's expertise.
* **B:** While a long or expensive trip might *benefit* from an agent, the passage emphasizes help with unfamiliarity, not just cost or length.
* **C:** A language barrier is mentioned as a situation where an agent is helpful, but the passage suggests agents provide broader assistance beyond just language issues.

The passage states that travel agents excel at providing good itineraries for trips, especially when they have experience with the destination's culture, language, or unique aspects.  A first-time traveler to a foreign/unique destination would benefit most from this expertise.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: እቲ ተጓዓዛይ ናብ ዓዱ ንምብጻሕ ናይ ምምላስ በረራታት ክሕዝ ከሎ (The traveler is looking to book return flights to a popular destination):** The passage states that agencies are often willing to handle routine travel and tickets. This doesn't *require* an agent's specialized knowledge.
* **C: እቲ ተጓዓዛይ ናይቲ ንዕረፍቲ ዝካየደሉ ቦታ ቋንቋ መበቆል ጽቡቕ ጌሩ ምስ ዝፈልጥ (The traveler already knows the language well in the place they want to visit):** If the traveler is already comfortable with the language, the agent's knowledge of it is less critical.
* **D: እቲ ተጓዓዛይ እቲ ባህላዊ ፍልልያት ኣብ ዝፈልጦ ቦታ ክበጽሕ ከሎ (The traveler is going to a place with cultural differences they already understand):**  Similar to C, if the traveler is already familiar with the cultural differences, they need less guidance.



"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ሓደ ተጓዓዛይ ሓደስቲ ቦታታት ኣብ ዝበጽሕሉ እዋን ተስፋ ንኸይቖርጽ ክሕግዞ ዝኽእል እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ምስቲ ዝመጸሉ ተመሳሳሊ መለክዒታት ምጽባይ (Being familiar with similar customs)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that things will be different in a new place - rules, food, traffic, greetings, etc.  It stresses the importance of remembering that things *won't* be like home. The key to navigating this is understanding and adapting to the *local* customs and ways of doing things. This is what will prevent frustration and help a traveler adjust.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ዘይትፈልጦም መግብታት ክትፍትን ድልውነት (Trying unfamiliar foods and differences):** While open-mindedness is good, simply *trying* different things doesn't help with the core issue of adapting to a new environment.
* **C: ነቲ ሕጊ ልክዕ ከምቲ ዝመጽሉ ከባቢ ምስዓብ (Understanding the laws like the place you came from):** The passage explicitly states laws are *different*. Trying to apply your old rules will cause problems.
* **D: ኣቐዲምካ ኣብ መዕረፊ ቦታታት ዝምልከት ዝግበር መጽናዕቲ ምውጋድ (Reversing the research done on greeting places before):** This doesn't make sense in the context of the passage. Researching greetings *before* you go is helpful, not something to reverse.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that things will be *different* when traveling - different rules, food, traffic, language, etc. It states you need to accept that things won't be like they are ""at home."" Someone who dislikes change (Option B) would likely struggle with these differences and experience frustration or disappointment.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: ፍሉይ መግቢ ዝፈቱ ሰብ (People who enjoy different foods):** This person would likely *enjoy* one aspect of travel, not be discouraged by it.
* **C: ዕጹው ኣእምሮ ዘለዎ ሰብ (People with a narrow mind):** While a narrow mind could contribute to difficulties, the passage specifically highlights the *differences* in environment as the source of potential frustration.
* **D: ትምህርቲ ዘሐጉሶ ሰብ (People who dislike learning):** Learning is often a part of travel, and someone who dislikes it wouldn't necessarily be *discouraged* from going.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically advises bringing a camp jacket or sleeping bag** to protect against cold, insects, etc. when camping in unfamiliar environments. This aligns directly with the advice for first-time travelers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብ መሬት ቅድሚ ምድቃስኩም እንስሳታት እቲ ከባቢ ፍለጡ** (Look for local animals before stepping on the ground) - While the passage mentions avoiding stepping on animals, it's not a primary piece of advice for first-time travelers. It's a general safety tip.
* **B: ኣብተን ቀዳሞት ሒደት መዓልታትኩም መግቢ ካብ ምብዛሕ ተቖጠቡ** (Limit food intake for the first few days) -  The passage actually suggests budgeting and spending money on good food, not restricting it.
* **D: መጀመርታ ኣብ ዝመጻእኹሉ እዋን ኣብ ጽሬት ዘለዎ ሆቴል መዕራፍ** (Stay in a luxurious hotel when you first arrive) - The passage suggests avoiding this to acclimatize to the local culture and environment. It recommends being frugal initially.

Here's why:

The passage specifically warns against immediately seeking out Western-style hotels and food on your first day in a new country, and spending a lot of money doing so. It suggests this hinders you from truly experiencing the local culture. The other options are mentioned as things you *might* bring or find, but the passage actively advises *against* prioritizing Western food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ፅሬት ዘለዎ ኣገልግሎት (High-quality service):** While not explicitly mentioned as something to avoid, the passage doesn't focus on service quality.
* **C: ካምፕ ንምግባር ዝኸውን ፍራሽ ወይ ፓድ (Sleeping bag or mat for camping):** The passage *suggests* bringing a camping jacket or mat if you plan to camp.
* **D: ጽሬት ዘለዎም ሆቴላት (High-quality hotels):**  The passage warns against immediately seeking out luxurious hotels.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""እንተ ድኣ ምስ ላፕቶፕ ወይ ታብለት ትጓዓዝ ኣለኻ፣ ኣብቲ ናቱ ማህደር ሜሞሪ ወይ ድማ ዲስክ ቅዳሕ(ብዘይ ኢንተርነት ዝርከብ) ኣቐምጥ።"" (If you are traveling with a laptop or tablet, store a copy on its memory or a disk (that does not require internet)).

This directly addresses the scenario of needing a policy copy without internet access.  The other options aren't ideal:

*   **A:** Sending a physical copy isn’t relevant to a virtual policy and doesn't address the no-internet constraint.
*   **B:** Sending a copy by email requires internet access to retrieve it.
*   **D:** Storing in ""the cloud"" *requires* internet access.

Here's why:

The text explicitly requests:

*   ""ምኽሪ/ፍቓድ ንምርካብን ናይ ይግበኣኒ ሕቶ ንምቕራብ ናይቲ ኢንሹራንስ ወሃቢ ናይ ኢ-ሜል ኣድራሻን ዓለምለኻዊ ስልኪ ቁፅርታት ክተርእዩ ኣለኩም።"" (I need the insurance provider's email address and international phone numbers to ask questions and get approval).

The text requests both the email *and* the international phone numbers for getting approval. Therefore, it is necessary to have the international phone number for getting approval.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ክሲ ንምቕራብ ዝሕግዙ ዓለምለኻውያን ቁጽሪ ተሌፎናት** - While international phone numbers are requested, it's specifically for *getting approval*, not just for ""claims.""
*   **B: ናይ’ቲ መድሕን ዝህብ ኢመይል ኣድራሻ** - The email address is also requested along with the phone number, making it necessary.
*   **D: ናይቲ ወናኒ ፖሊሲ ኢመይል ኣድራሻ** - The text doesn't mention needing the email address of the policy owner/holder, only the insurance provider.

Here's why:

The passage states that medium format film cameras use a 6 x 6 cm format, which equates to a 56 x 56 mm negative. It specifically highlights this as the size of the negative produced by these cameras.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 6 x 6 ሴንቲ ሜትር ኣሉታዊ** - While correct in stating the format size, the question asks for the *negative* size in millimeters, and 6x6 cm is the format, not the actual negative dimensions.
* **C: 35 ሚሊ ሜትር ኣሉታዊ** - This refers to the standard 35mm film format, which the passage contrasts *with* the medium format.
* **D: 36 x 24 ሚሊ ሜትር ኣሉታዊ** - This is a detail *within* the 35mm format, referring to the image size, but not the overall negative size described for the medium format cameras.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that 35mm film ""with ease can be carried around, providing an image quality comparable to that of a modern DSLR."" The question asks which format is *similar* to a DSLR, and the passage directly links 35mm film to DSLR quality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ማእከላይ ቅርጺ ዘለዎ ፊልም:** While the passage discusses medium format, it doesn't say it's similar to a DSLR - it emphasizes its higher resolution.
* **C: 56 x 56 ሚሊ ሜትር ፊልም:** This is a specific size *within* medium format, and again the passage highlights its higher resolution, not its similarity to DSLRs.
* **D: 6 x 6 ሴንቲ ሜትር ፊልም:**  Same as above - it's medium format and distinguished by its higher resolution.

Here's why:

The passage states that the *easiest* way to start publishing travel writing is by creating a travel blog and website.  While the other options are related to travel writing, they are steps *after* or *leading up to* that initial step:

* **A: ቅርጺ መርበብ ሓበሬታ ምልምማድ (Researching web information)** is preparation, not the direct starting point.
* **B: ንሓደ ዝና ዘለዎ ናይ ጉዕዞ ብሎግ ሓያሎ ጽሑፋት ጽሓፍ (Writing a lot of articles for an existing travel blog)** means you are contributing to someone else's platform, not starting your own.

The passage specifically highlights *creating your own website* as the easiest way to get started."

Here's why:

The passage states that starting a travel blog and website is the *easiest* way to begin sharing travel writing.  The other options are steps *after* you've started a blog:

* **ቅርጺ መርበብ ሓበሬታ (Web design):**  You need a blog *first* to design it.
* **ኣርትዖት ምግባር (Editing):** You need writing *first* to edit it.
* **ምፍጣር መርበብ ሓበሬታ (Web development):** This is related to web design and comes after the initial blog setup.

Therefore, **blogging** is the foundational, first step mentioned in the passage.

The passage states: ""ኣብ ውዕይ ጽባይ ኣየር ናይ መዓናጡ ጸገም ብጣዕሚ ዝተለመዱ እዮም ።"" which translates to ""In humid climates, stomach upsets are commonly encountered.""

Therefore, stomach upsets (መዓናጡ ጸገም) are most commonly found in humid climates."

The text states that ""P: ኣብ ገዛ፣ ብምኽንያት ቀጻሊ ምቅላዕ ንናይ ገዛ ጀርምታት፣ ብኣኣቶም ናይ ምልካፍ ዕድልካ ትሑት እዩ። ግን ከኣ ኣብ ካልኦት ንዓኻ ዝሕድሱኻ ዝኽእሉ ባክተሪዮሎጂክ ፎውና ዘለዎም ክፋላት ዓለም፣ ሽግራት ከጋጥሙኻ ዝያዳ ተኽእሎ ኣለካ."" This directly translates to ""In the home, due to continuous exposure to resident germs, your chance of contracting an illness from them is low. But in other parts of the world with different bacteriological environments, you have a higher chance of encountering new germs.""

This means that traveling exposes you to new germs, which can cause illness. The text doesn't mention that improper cleaning specifically causes any of the listed illnesses (A, C, or D), but rather that exposure to *new* germs is the risk."

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that with a Schengen visa, you don't need individual visas for each Schengen member country.  This means you avoid the hassle of repeatedly answering visa questions for each border crossing.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: ገንዘብ ምቑጣብ (Saving money):** While the passage mentions saving time, money, and paperwork, avoiding visa questions is a more direct benefit highlighted.
* **C: ካብ ብዙሓት ናይ ፓስፖርት ቁጽጽር ቦታታት ምውጋድ (Avoiding many passport control points):** The passage *implies* this by saying you can travel without border checks within the area, but the main benefit is the visa simplification.
* **D: ፓስፖርት ዘድልዮ ኣይኮነን (Passport is not needed):** The passage states you can travel ""without repeatedly showing your identity/passport,"" meaning you still *need* a passport, just don't have to present it at every border.

Here's why:

The text states ""The body remains are no longer in it, but have been transferred to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo."" This means the mummy itself (and thus, its sarcophagus) is no longer in the tomb. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ገለ ስልማት** (some steps): The text doesn't mention steps being removed or inaccessible.
*   **B: ርእሲ እቲ ሙሚ** (the mummy's head): The head is part of the mummy, which is now in the Cairo museum.
*   **D: እቲ ሃብቲ** (the treasures): The text indicates the tomb still contains treasures, even if it's small and cramped."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ባሕርን ሰማይን ብሓባር ናብ ዝረኣየሉ ብራኸ:** This refers to a specific trail (Sea to Sky Corridor), not a place with affordable options.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Bowen Island ""offers a diverse range of day trips or weekend getaways"" with activities like kayaking, hiking, shops, and restaurants, and that it's a ""genuine community"" close to Vancouver.  It's positioned as a place to *experience* Vancouver's culture and nature.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Whistler:** While mentioned, Whistler is described as further away (1.5-hour drive) and is primarily known for winter sports. The text doesn't present it as offering the same breadth of easily accessible, ""genuine"" Vancouver experiences.
* **C: Downtown Vancouver:** The text mentions easy access *to* Granville Island *from* downtown Vancouver, but doesn't describe downtown itself as offering the comprehensive experience.
* **D: Granville Island:** Granville Island is reachable from downtown, but the text implies Bowen Island is the more authentic and diverse option for a day trip or weekend getaway.

The passage states that during the rainy seasons (November or December - which correspond roughly to our November/December), the water volume increases and the falling water is ""brilliantly abundant."" This suggests a more dramatic and impressive display of the falls during these months.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ዘይድብዝዝ ትርኢት ፎልስ** - The passage says the opposite, describing a *more* brilliant display.

The passage explicitly states that if photographing something is prohibited, filming a video of it is also prohibited. It also emphasizes the importance of verifying what is allowed *before* filming, especially when using a drone. Options A, C, and D don't directly relate to this core principle. 

Therefore, areas where photo graphing is forbidden are also off limits for video recording."

The passage explicitly states that in some countries, registration involves contacting the *immigration office* (ስደተኛታት ቢሮ). This is where foreigners are required to register their presence, particularly if they are not staying in tourist accommodations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣብቲ ከባቢ ዝርከብ መደበር ፖሊስ (Local Police Station):** The passage mentions filling out a police form, but it suggests the immigration office is the primary place for registration.

The passage explicitly states that volunteering is a good way to *acquire new skills* (""ሓደስቲ ክእለታት ንምርካብ ጽቡቕ መንገዲ እዩ"").  Someone who *doesn't* hope to gain skills would not benefit from the volunteering experience as described in the passage.

*   **D: ኣብ ክፍልን ሰሌዳን ተገዳስነት ክህልዎ ዝኽእል ሰብ (Someone who can offer room and board)** - The passage states that many volunteer positions *provide* room and board, not that you need to offer it.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ብዙሓት ናይ ሰናይ ፍቓድ ስራሕቲ ክፍልን ሰሌዳን ስለዝወሃቡ"" (Many volunteer jobs provide room and board). This directly supports the idea that volunteer work abroad can help with budgeting by covering these expenses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ዳርጋ ኩሉ ግዜ ደሞዝ ይወሃብ** (Salary is always paid): The passage says some jobs offer *low* pay, not that a salary is always guaranteed.
*   **B: መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ ናብ ዕድላት ስራሕ ይመርሕ** (It often leads to job opportunities): While possible, the passage doesn't emphasize this as a primary benefit for budget travelers.
*   **D: ናይ ኣረኣእያ ስምዒት ንኽህልወኩም ክሕግዝ ይኽእል እዩ** (It can help to have a perspective): This is mentioned as a benefit, but not specifically related to budgeting.

Here's why:

The passage states the trip involves ""ከምኡውን ናብ ቤት ምምላስ ይጠቓልል"" (and includes accommodations) and specifically mentions staying at a Disney hotel (""ዲስነይ ሆቴል""). It also says ""ምስ ሓደ ሰሙን ከባቢ ናይ ዲስነይ ናውቲ ሓደገ"" (about a week of Disney visits).  This points to a week-long stay at Disney resorts being a central part of the average trip.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ካብቲ ቦታ ወጻኢ ኣብ ዝርከብ ሆቴል ምጽናሕ** (Staying at a hotel outside the park) - The passage emphasizes staying *at* a Disney hotel.
* **C: ምሉእ እቲ ጉዕዞ ኣብ ንብረት ዲዝኒ ምሕላፍ** (Spending the entire trip on Disney property) - While a large part is on Disney property, the passage doesn't state *everything* is.
* **D: ካብ መዓርፎ ነፈርቲ ናብ ሆቴል ብኣውቶቡስ ምኻድ** (Taking a bus from the airport to the hotel) - This is just one small part of the trip; the passage doesn't highlight it as central.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Disney **does not allow** the transfer of tickets: ""this seemingly lucrative practice, however, is against Disney policy; the tickets are non-transferable.""  Therefore, the statement that park-hopper tickets *are* transferable is false.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

*   **B: There is lodging on site:** The text mentions staying at a Disney hotel.
*   **C: There are buses to transport guests from the airport to the property:** The passage describes transportation ""from the Orlando International Airport"" and implies it includes a ride to the Disney hotel.
*   **D: Multi-day tickets are often available on auction websites:** The passage directly states that many tickets are sold through online auction sites like eBay or Craigslist."

Here's why:

The passage states that survival books and magazines are *common*, but detailed information about specific conflict zones is *rare*. This implies that general survival skills (basic survival) are taught, but specific knowledge about where conflicts are happening is not commonly part of the training.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ምድሓን በረኻ (Wilderness First Aid)** - The passage explicitly states first aid is *included* in the training.
*   **B: ድልውነት ቀዳማይ ረድኤት (Advanced First Aid)** - Like A, first aid is mentioned as part of the course.
*   **C: ድልውነት ዞባ ውግእ (Conflict Zone Awareness)** - The passage says information about conflict zones is *lacking* in resources, but the course is *for* operating in hostile environments. However, the passage states that detailed info on conflict zones are rare in the books or magazines, so it is unlikely to be a main focus of the course.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""ብዙሕ ናይ ቀዳማይ ረድኤትን..."" (much of the training includes first aid). It also emphasizes that the training is practical, suggesting that first aid skills would be a core and frequently used component in a hostile environment.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: ዞባታት ውግእ (Areas of Conflict):** While the course is *for* conflict zones, the training focuses on *surviving* in them, not specifically on knowledge *about* them.
*   **C: ምድሓን በረኻ (Desert Survival):** The text notes that desert survival books are common, but information about specific hostile locations is rare. This implies desert survival isn't the main focus.
*   **D: ተጻባእቲ ሃዋህው (Air Tactics):** This isn’t mentioned at all in the passage.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ክብከል ዝኽእል ማይ ንምውጋድ እቲ ዝበለጸ ኣማራጺ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ዝተዓሸገ ማይ ምግዛእ (Buying bottled water)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""ዝተሓሳስበኩም ነገር እንተሃልዩ፣ ማይኹም ፅቡቅ ስም ካብ ዘለዎ ኩባንያ ብዝተዓሸገ ጠርሙዝ ንምግዛእ ምሕሳብ ይግበኣኩ።"" This translates to ""If you are concerned, you may need to consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.""

This directly suggests buying bottled water as a solution to concerns about water quality, especially given the varying contamination levels in different areas as described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ማይ ንሓያሎ ደቓይቕ ምፍላሕ (Boiling water for a long time)** - While boiling water can purify it, the passage focuses on differing levels of contamination, not just needing purification. It doesn't position this as the *best* alternative.
* **C: ንሓደ ደቒቕ ማይ ምፍላሕ (Boiling water for one minute)** - The passage mentions boiling times vary.  One minute may not be sufficient in all areas.
* **D: ነቲ ማይ ፍሉይ ስግኣታት እንተሃልዩዎ ምግምጋም (Comparing different qualities of water)** - This is a step in *identifying* the problem, not solving it.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""መብዛሕትኦም ሞታት ኣንጻር ናብቲ ማይ ዝወፅእ ሓይሊ ማዕበል እንዳሕምሱ እዩ፤ እዚ ድማ ኣይከኣልን።"" (Most deaths are contrary to the force of water that emerges from the whirlpool; this is not possible.).  This directly warns against swimming in a whirlpool. The rest of the passage talks about generally being careful while swimming and not overestimating your abilities, but the only *definitive* ""can't do"" mentioned is fighting against the force of a whirlpool.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ምስ ሪፍ ብቐረባ ምሕንባስ (Swimming close to a reef):** The passage doesn't mention reefs specifically.
*   **B: ኣብ ዓሚቝ ማይ ምሕንባስ (Swimming in deep water):**  While the passage warns about currents, it doesn't explicitly forbid deep water swimming.
*   **C: ኣንጻር ውሕጅ ምሕንባስ (Swimming against the current):** The passage warns against it, but states it is not possible to overcome the whirlpool current.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage describes rip currents (ምስጣቅ ባሕሪ ምልሲት).**  It says they pull you *away* from shore.
* **The passage explicitly states that swimming *against* the current (ካብቲ ዋሕዚ እንድሕሪ ወጺኻ) is exhausting and ineffective.**
* **The correct strategy is to swim *parallel* to the shore (ናብ ካልእ ኣንፈት ብምዕላም) to get out of the rip current, then swim back to shore.**  This is exactly what option A describes.

Let's look at why the other options are wrong:

* **B: ኣንጻር እቲ ዋሕዚ ብቕልጡፍ ምሕንባስ** - The passage says *not* to do this.
* **C: ብኣንጻሩ ኣንፈት ምሕንባስ** - This is unclear and doesn't describe the proper escape technique.
* **D: ኣብ ትሕቲ መሬት ምሕንባስ** - This is not relevant to escaping a rip current.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""ጉብናይ ኣብ ሽንጥሮ ራይን ውሽጢ ዘለዉ ቤተ-መንግስታት"" as an example of a possible pilgrimage route.  The question asks where visiting castles would make a valuable pilgrimage trip.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብ ወሰን ሩባ ዳኑብ እትርከብ ከተማ:** While the Danube is mentioned, the passage doesn't focus on cities *along* the Danube specifically, but travelling *on* it.
* **B: ኣብ ጎኒ ወሽመጥ ኤሪ:** Lake Erie is mentioned, but not in the context of being a prime location for a pilgrimage visiting castles.
* **D: ኣብ ጥቓ ዝኾነ ውሽጣዊ መንገዲ ማይ:** This is too broad. The passage gives specific rivers (Rhine, Danube) as examples, not just any inland waterway.

* **B: ባህላዊ ፍልልያት ካብ ደቂ ዓዲ ሓያል ጠባይ ከለዓዕል ከም ዝኽእል ኣስተውዕሉ** - The passage doesn't discourage recognizing cultural differences.  It focuses on not letting them *restrict* you.
* **C: ብልጭ ዝብሉ ስልማት ካብ ምግባር ተቖጠቡ** - The passage actually mentions potentially problematic behaviors like deception and holding hands, suggesting caution, but not complete avoidance, and frames them within a cultural context.
* **D: ኣድላዪ ኣብ ዝኾነሉ እዋን ትሪነት ተጠቐሙ** -  This isn't addressed in the passage.  The focus is on societal and cultural expectations, not personal safety in general.

It also points out that certain behaviors are presented as customary but aren't universally acceptable or necessary, specifically referencing potentially coercive or unwanted advances.
* **The passage specifically warns against assuming obligations.** The passage challenges the idea that women *must* always accept a proposal or conform to a ""husband's"" role.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ንኹነታት ሓዳር ንምምልካት ዓቢ ቀለቤት ምግባር** (Engaging in large engagement parties to fill marital status) - The passage suggests questioning the need for marriage itself, not emphasizing grand celebrations of it.

* **D: ኣብ እዋን ዘይተደልየ ምዕባለታት፡ ንደቂ ተባዕትዮ ኣብ ምንጻግ ጽኑዓት ኩና** (Be steadfast in protecting fellow women during unwanted encounters) - This is a good sentiment, but it's not the *primary* message of the passage. The passage focuses on internal empowerment and questioning societal expectations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: እቶም ፎቶ ንንግዳዊ ዕላማ ዝውዕሉ እንተኾይኖም** - The passage mentions restrictions for photographers aiming for commercial purposes, but doesn't link this to needing different lenses.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that visibility is reduced during snowstorms due to falling snow, blowing snow, or frost on vehicle windows.  This directly impacts a driver's ability to safely navigate, especially in areas prone to snowfall.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ብርቱዕ ምንቅስቓስ (Heavy traffic):** While traffic can be a problem, the passage focuses on the *cause* of driving difficulty (snow and reduced visibility), not the result of many cars.
* **C: ካብ መጠን ንላዕሊ ምውህሃድ (Overconfidence):**  The passage doesn't mention driver confidence.
* **D: ምጉዳል ርኡይነት (Rough roads):**  The passage focuses on the impact of snow on visibility, not the condition of the road surface itself (though snow can *cause* rough roads).

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ናይ ኣታዊ መጠኑን ወለዱን እውን ካብ ሃገር ናብ ሃገር ብሰፊሑ ዝተፈላለየ እዩ።"" This translates to ""Tax rates and amounts also vary widely from country to country."" This directly relates to *prices* (or costs) of taxes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: መዋቕር (Structures):**  While tax *systems* might differ, the passage focuses on the amount of tax, not the overall structure.
* **C: ፋይል እትገብሩሉ ቦታ (Where you file):**  The passage doesn't discuss where you file taxes, only the amount.
* **D: ብራኬትስ (Brackets):** Although tax brackets are part of a tax system, the passage is talking about the overall varying *amounts* of tax.

Here's why:

The passage states that as a non-diplomat working abroad, you are generally required to pay taxes in the country where you are assigned. While it mentions complexities in federal countries like the US and Canada, the fundamental principle is paying taxes where you *live* (your place of assignment).  The passage doesn't suggest a default of paying taxes in America, where you currently work, or a specific location for consolidated filing.

Therefore, the most logical and direct answer based on the text is where you reside."

*   **A: ምርኢታት ታሪኽ ወይ ባህሊ ሓንቲ ሃገር ከርእዩ ይኽእሉ እዮም** - This is directly stated in the text: ""ባህለንን ታሪኸንን ንምርኣይ፣ ስነ-ጥበባዊን ትምህርታውን ምርኢታት ኣብ ሃገራዊ ኤክስፖታት የቕርባ.""
*   **B: ምርኢት ስነ-ዕጽዋት ጎኒ ጎኒ ስነ-ጥበባውን ትምህርታውን ምርኢታት ይቐርብ** - The text mentions both horticultural expositions with displays of plants and general expositions with art and educational exhibits.
*   **C: ፍጻመታት ክሳብ ሽዱሽተ ወርሒ ክጸንሑ ይኽእሉ** - The text explicitly states: ""ኣብ ሰለስተ ክሳዕ ሽዱሽተ ኣዋርሕ ዝጸንሑ ኮይኖም.""

* **The passage states:** ""ተሳተፍቲ ሃገራት፣ ዓለማዊ ዛዕባታት ንምቅላዕ ወይ ድማ ባህለንን ታሪኸንን ንምርኣይ፣ ስነ-ጥበባዊን ትምህርታውን ምርኢታት ኣብ ሃገራዊ ኤክስፖታት የቕርባ."" This directly supports option A – expositions showcase a nation's history and global themes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage says they *can* be held annually in different countries, so a single country cannot host them all.
* **C:** The passage states they last *between* 3-6 months, not that they *must* last up to 6 months.
* **D:** The passage doesn't say all countries must participate. It refers to ""participating countries."""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ምኡዝ ሽታ ዘለዎ ዕሸል ምሓዝ** (Holding smelly food) - The text advises *against* having food with strong odors.
* **B: ካብ መዓስከር ጓሓፍ ምእላይ** (Leaving camp tidy) - While keeping a clean campsite is important, it doesn't directly reduce the risk of animal attacks.
* **D: ንእንስሳታት ብናይ መግቢ ቁርጽራጽ ምድኻም** (Feeding animals) - The text specifically states *not* to feed wild animals.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on these dangers regarding wild animals:

*   **Getting too close:**  Specifically mentions distances to maintain from bison, elk, moose, bears, and deer (100 yards for bison/elk, 25 yards for others).  It warns about the dangers of these large animals.
*   **Feeding/approaching:** Explicitly states not to feed or approach wild animals.
*   **Food storage:**  Emphasizes keeping a clean camp and storing food properly to avoid attracting animals.
*   **Ignoring warnings:** States that many injuries happen each year from people not respecting the distance.

**Strong smells (ብርቱዕ ሽታ)** aren't mentioned as a specific danger or attractant in the text. While smells *can* attract animals, the passage doesn't highlight it as a specific precaution.

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned:

*   **B: ርሕቀት ምሕላው ዘይምኽኣል (Failing to maintain distance):** Directly stated as a cause of injuries.
*   **C: ንእንስሳ ዘገዳም ምምጋብ (Provoking animals):**  Not explicitly stated, but implied when advising against approaching and feeding.
*   **D: ምስ ሰብ ዘይቀራረቡ እንስሳታት (Animals that don't associate with humans):** Implied as the animals are described as ""wild"" and ""potentially dangerous."""
