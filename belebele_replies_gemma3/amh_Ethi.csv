ምንባቡን መሰረት በማድረግ አኮርዲዮንን በተሳካ ሁኔታ ለመጫወት ትክክለኛ ፍንጭ እንዳልሆነ የሚቆጠረው ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ለተጨማሪ የድምጽ መጠን ቁልፎቹን የሚመቱበት ኃይልን ይጨምሩ**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that, unlike a piano, you *don't* need to press the keys harder on an accordion to get more volume. It explicitly contrasts this with how an accordion achieves louder sounds – by using the bellows with more pressure and speed. Therefore, increasing the force with which you strike the keys is presented as *incorrect* technique.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **B:** The passage *encourages* minimizing unnecessary movement to avoid fatigue.
*   **C:** The passage *emphasizes* keeping your hand relaxed and focusing on hitting the notes accurately.
*   **D:** The passage *states* that increasing the speed of the bellows is how you get more volume.

አኮርዲዮኑን ሲጫወቱ ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ ድምጽን ለመጨመር የሚያግዘው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ተጨማሪ ፍጥነት**.

The passage specifically states: ""on the accordion, to get more volume, use the bellows with more pressure *and* speed.""  Therefore, speed is a key factor in increasing volume.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ተጨማሪ ኃይል (More force):** The passage compares accordion playing to piano playing, stating you *don't* need more force like you would on piano keys.
* **C: ያነሰ ግፊት (Less pressure):** The passage explicitly says to use *more* pressure on the bellows.
* **D: ያነሰ የጣት እንቅስቃሴ (Less finger movement):** The passage advises against excessive finger movement, but doesn't link it to volume."
በቴሌቪዥን ላይ ያሉ ምስሎች ለምንድን ነው ጫፎቻቸው የሚቆረጠው?,"The correct answer is **B: ምስሉ ሙሉውን ማያ ገጽ እንዲሞላ**.

The passage explicitly states that overscan was done ""to make sure the picture filled the entire screen."" While it *can* result in subtitles being cut off (as mentioned later), the *reason* for overscan itself is to fill the screen."
በምንባቡ መሰረት አንድ ሰው ፊልምን ወደ ዲቪዲ ቅርጸት ሲለውጥ ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ የትኞቹ ችግሮች ሊገጥሙት ይችላሉ?,"The correct answer is **B: በከፊል የተቆረጡ የግርጌ ጽሑፎች**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that overscan can cause subtitles at the bottom of the screen to be cut off when converting a film to DVD. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሙሉ ማያውን የማይሞላ ምስል** - The passage discusses *overscan*, which is the opposite of this - the image is made to fill the screen.
*   **C: ሙሉውን ማያ የሚሞላ ምስል** - This is the *result* of overscan on a TV, but not a problem encountered *during* DVD conversion.
*   **D: የተቆረጡ ጫፎች** - While overscan *causes* cropping, the passage specifically highlights the issue with subtitles at the bottom.

የብሪታኒያ ጠባቂ ጦሮች የት ነበር የሰፈሩት?,"The correct answer is **A: አሰንፒንክ ክሪክ (Assunpink Creek)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that General Ewing crossed the Assunpink Creek ""to prevent any of the enemy troops from escaping"". This indicates the British troops were positioned *near* or *at* the Assunpink Creek, acting as a defensive line.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ትሬንተን (Trenton):** The main attack was *on* Trenton, not where the British were initially stationed to defend against the attack.
*   **C: ቦርደርታውን ( Bordertown):** This location is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: ፕሪስተን (Princeton):** This location is not mentioned in the passage."
በእጅ በተጻፈው ረቂቅ ላይ የማን ፊርማ ነው የሚታየው?,"The correct answer is **D: ቻርልስ ቶምሰን**.

The passage states the document was signed by President John Hancock **and** Secretary Charles Thomson. While John Hancock is more famous, Charles Thomson's signature was also on the handwritten draft. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ጆን ዱንላፕ** - Dunlap was the printer, not a signer. The printed copies are called ""Dunlap broadsides"" after him.
* **B: ጆርጅ ዋሺንግተን** - George Washington received a copy *after* it was signed, he didn't sign it.
* **C: ጆን ኒክሰን** - John Nixon read the first public reading of the document, he didn't sign it.



"
ከሚከተሉት አካባቢዎች ውስጥ የዱንላፕ ብሮድ ሳይድ በመጨረሻ የመጣው የት ነበር?,"The correct answer is **C: ለንደን**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""ቅጂው ነሐሴ 10 ላይ ለንደን ደርሷል።"" (The copy reached London on August 10th). This indicates that a copy of the Dunlap Broadside ultimately ended up in London.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኒው ዮርክ** - While a copy was sent to the troops in New York on July 9th, the text doesn't say it *ended up* there permanently.
*   **B: የዱንላፕ የህትመት መደብር** - The Dunlap Broadside was *printed* at Dunlap's print shop, but the question asks where a copy *ended up*.
*   **D: የነጻነት አዳራሽ ግቢ** - The first public reading was there, but it doesn't mean a copy stayed there."
የኮሎኔል ስታርክ ወታደሮች የት ነበር የሰፈሩት?,"The correct answer is **A: በስተሰሜን ጫፍ፣ አጥሩ ጋር**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""የቅኝ ግዛት ሰዎች በስተሰሜን ጫፍ ባለው የቅኝ ግዛት አጥር በኩል ቦታዎችን ይይዛሉ።"" This directly indicates that Colonel Stark's troops settled at the northern end, along the fort.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ከውሃው ጫፍ ባለው የባህር ዳርቻ ላይ** - While they extended the fort *to* the water's edge, they didn't settle *on* the beach.
*   **C: ከባህረ ሰላጤው ሰሜን-ምስራቅ በኩል** - This describes the *location of the breach*, not where the troops settled.
*   **D: ከአጥሩ ፊት ለፊት** - They set up a wooden barricade 100 feet in front of the fort, but didn't settle *there* – it was a forward position."
በምንባቡ መሰረት የስታርክ ወታደሮች አጥራቸውን ያሰፉት መቼ ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: በዝቅተኛ ሞገድ ወቅት**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ዝቅተኛ ሞገድ ባሕረ ሰላጤው ሰሜን ምስራቅ አቅጣጫ በሚስቲክ ወንዝ በኩል አንድ ክፍተት ሲፈጥር፣ በአፋጣኝ አጥሩን በአጭር የድንጋይ ግድግዳ ወደ ሰሜን አሰፉ..."" This directly indicates they extended the fort during a low tide.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ቀኝ ገዢዎቹ ተጨማሪ ኃይል ሲጠሩ** - While the colonials *received* a call for reinforcements, the fort expansion happened *because* of the low tide, not in response to the call.
*   **B: መደበኛዎቹ እንጨቱን ካለፉ በኋላ** - Stark ordered no firing until the regulars passed the wood, but the fort expansion occurred *before* that point, during the low tide.
*   **D: ወታደሮቹ ከፊት ቦታዎችን ከያዙ በኋላ** - The text doesn’t state the fort was extended *after* occupying positions; it happened concurrently with exploiting the low tide to extend the fort’s protective barrier.

በምንባቡ መሰረት ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ የቻይና በጣም ብጥብጥ የበዛበት ክፍለ ዘመን የትኛው ነበር?,"The correct answer is **D: የሶስት ግዛቶች ክፍለ ዘመን**.

The passage explicitly states that the period of the Three Kingdoms was a time ""filled with bloodshed"" in ancient Chinese history, with ""thousands"" dying in the struggle for the throne. It also directly links this period to intense warfare among many lords.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የጂን ስርወ መንግስት** - The passage mentions the Jin dynasty *in relation to* the Three Kingdoms period, but doesn't describe it as particularly violent itself.
*   **B: የዢ’አን ክፍለ ዘመን** - The passage mentions the Xian dynasty as the dynasty people were fighting to rule, but doesn't describe the dynasty itself as a time of great conflict.
*   **C: የሀን ስርወ መንግስት** - The Han dynasty is mentioned as existing *before* the Three Kingdoms period, but isn't described as being especially violent within the passage."
በምንባቡ መሰረት የጉንዳን ሰራዊት ኮሎኒ ወደ የዘላን ምዕራፍ ሲገቡ እውነት የሆነው ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ከ 17 ቀናት በኋላ የሚቀየሩ ማረፊያዎችን ይሰራሉ**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""During this time, the colony constructs temporary shelters that change daily. These [zelan] disruptions or marches each last approximately 17 days."" This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ምሽት ላይ ማረፊያ ሰርተው ያርፋሉ** - While they rest, it's *under shade* during the day, not making shelters at night.
* **B: ዝቅተኛ የምግብ አቅርቦታ አላቸው** - Low food supply *triggers* the zelan phase, but isn't a defining characteristic *of* the phase itself.
* **D: ቀን ላይ ይጓዛሉ** - The passage states they travel at *night* during the zelan phase.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት ስለጉንዳን ሰራዊት ኮሎኒ በዘላን ምዕራፍ ላይ ማረፊያ የመስራት ልማዶች በትክክል የሚገልጸው መግለጫ የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ማረፊያዎችን በየቀኑ ይቀይራሉ**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""This period, the colony constructs temporary shelters that are changed daily."" This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ምሽት ላይ ማረፊያ ይሰራሉ** - The passage says they rest in the shade during the day, not build shelters at night.
* **B: ማረፊያ ሰርተው ሳያርፉ ለ 17 ቀናት በሰልፍ ይጓዛሉ** - They *do* rest, building temporary shelters.  The 17 days refers to the length of a ""raid"" or ""sortie,"" not continuous travel without shelter.
* **D: ወቅቱ ለሚቆይበት ጊዜ ያህል ተመሳሳይ ማረፊያዎችን ይጠቀማሉ** -  The passage explicitly states the shelters are *changed daily*, contradicting this option.



"
ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ ውጫዊ ምልክቶች ቢኖሩ እንኳን የሚቀጥለው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ባዮሎጂያዊ ሰዓቶች**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ባዮሎጂያዊ ሰዓቶች እራሳቸውን የሚደግፉ ኦሲሌተሮች ናቸው ፣ የውጭ ምልክቶች ባይኖሩም እንኳ ነፃ የማሽከርከር ብስክሌት ጊዜን የሚቀጥሉ።""  This directly means biological clocks continue to run *even without* external cues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ውስጠመጥ ዑደቶች (Internal cycles):** While biological clocks *are* internal cycles, the passage specifically highlights their ability to run independently of external cues.
* **B: ወቅታዊ ምቶች (Seasonal responses):** These are *responses* to external cues (like changing seasons), so they wouldn't continue if external cues were removed.
* **D: የተስተዋሉ ምቶች (Observable behaviors):**  These are the *result* of the internal processes, not the process that continues independently.



"
በተወሰኑ ተፈጥሯዊ ባህሪ ላይ ተለዋዋጭነቶችን የሚሳዩ ግለሰቦችን የሚገልጸው የትኛው ስም ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: ፖሊሞርፊክ (Polymorphic)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ግለሰቦች የአንድን ፀባይ የተለያዩ ገፅታዎች በሚያሳዩበት ጊዜ polymorphic ይባላሉ"" (Individuals are called polymorphic when they show different aspects of a trait).
* **The question asks:** which term describes individuals showing variations on a specific trait.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ሞኖሞርፊክ (Monomorphic):** The passage defines this as *similar* with a unique trait, not *varying* traits.
* **B: ፍጥረታት (Creatures):** This is a general term and doesn't relate to the specific concept of trait variation within a population.
* **C: ዝርያዎች (Species):** This is a broader classification and doesn't describe the variation *within* a population.



"
የሆነ የተወሰነ ቦታ ላይ ስለሚሰፍሩ ፍጥረታት ትክክለኛ መጠሪያ የሆነው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: ህዝብ (Population)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage defines a population** as a group of animals of a single species living in a particular area.  This directly answers the question.
* **Monomorphic** and **polymorphic** describe *characteristics within* a population, not the population itself.
* **Species** is a broader classification than what's being asked for.  A species can be made up of many populations.

Therefore, the best fit is **ህዝብ**."
ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ ተፈጥሮ-ተኮር የቱሪዝም እንቅስቃሴ ምሳሌ ያልሆነው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: የሳይንስ ቤተ መዘክር መጎብኘት (Visiting a science museum)**.

Here's why:

* **Nature-based tourism** focuses on experiencing *natural* environments and wildlife.
* **A: ወደ ፏፏቴ እግር ጉዞ ማድረግ (Hiking to a waterfall)** - This is directly experiencing a natural landscape.
* **B: የዱር አበባዎችን ፎቶ ማንሳት (Photographing wildflowers)** - This involves observing and appreciating nature.
* **D: ፍላይ ፊሺንግ (Fly fishing)** - This takes place in a natural environment (rivers/streams) and interacts with wildlife (fish).
* **C: የሳይንስ ቤተ መዘክር መጎብኘት (Visiting a science museum)** - While educational, a science museum is a *built environment* and doesn't involve direct immersion in nature. It's about learning *about* science, not experiencing nature itself.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት የትራንስፖርት ስርዓት መሰረት የሆነው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: የግል መኪናዎች**.

The passage explicitly states that ""ሁሉም ሰው በሆነ መንገድ በግል መኪናዎች ላይ የተመሠረተ የትራንስፖርት ስርዓት እንደምንም ተገናኝቷል እንዲሁም ይደግፋል።"" This directly indicates that private cars are the foundation of the transportation system described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የስራ መዳረሻዎች** - While work locations are *affected* by the system, they aren't the foundation *of* the system.
*   **C: የተረጋጋ ባዮስፌር** - The passage states the transportation system *disrupted* a stable biosphere, so it can't be the basis of it.
*   **D: የሰው ልጅ ዝግመተ ለውጥ** - Evolution is a result of the long-term environment, not the cause of the current transportation system.



"
ኒውክለስን የሚዞሩ ፓርቲክሎች የትኛው የኃይል አይነት ነው ያላቸው?,"The correct answer is **C: አሉታዊ ኃይል**.

The text states: ""ኤሌክትሮንስ ኔጌቲቭ የኤሌክትሪክ ሀይል አላቸው"" (Electrons have a negative electric charge). Since the question asks about the charge of the particles orbiting the nucleus (which are electrons), the answer is negative charge."
ኒውክለስ የተዋቀረው ከየትኞቹ ፓርቲክሎች ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ፕሩቶኖች እና ኒውትሮኖች**. 

The text explicitly states: ""ኒውክለሱ ሁለት ፓርቲክሎች አሉት - ኒውትሮንስ እና ፕሮቶንስ ናቸው."" (The nucleus has two particles - neutrons and protons.)"
በምንባቡ መሰረት የአምስት ቢት ባይነሪ ቁጥር ምሳሌ የሆነው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: 10010**.

Here's why:

* **Binary Numbers:** Binary numbers only use the digits 0 and 1.
* **Five-bit:**  The question asks for a *five-bit* binary number, meaning it must have exactly five digits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 1010:** This is a four-bit binary number.
* **B: 12001:** This includes the digit '2', which is not allowed in binary.
* **D: 110101:** This is a six-bit binary number.

Therefore, **10010** is the only option that fits the criteria of being a five-bit binary number.

ባይነሪ አሃዞች ሌላ ስምም አላቸው፣ ይህም?,"The correct answer is **A: ቢትስ**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...እነዚህ ቁጥሮች የሁለትዮሽ ቁጥሮች በመባል ይታወቃሉ - ወይም ቢትስ..."" This directly answers the question."

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on how blogging *increases* scrutiny and critical feedback.** It states students strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism from their audience. This is the opposite of reducing negative feedback from peers.
* **A: በሰዋሰው እና የመጻፍ ብቃት ላይ መሻሻል** - The passage explicitly mentions improvement in writing and clarity due to audience presence.
* **C: ስለከባቢ ሁኔታ ሰፊ ግንዛቤ መጨበጥ** -  The passage states blogging ""forces students to be more aware of the world around them.""
* **D: ቀጣይነት ላለው ትምህርት ፍላጎት መጨመር** - The passage says blogging encourages learning beyond the classroom and fosters engagement with educational materials.

Therefore, reducing peer criticism is *not* a benefit mentioned in the text – in fact, the text implies the opposite."

Here's why:

The passage states, ""ታዳሚዎችን ፍላጎት የመመገብ አስፈላጊነት ተማሪዎች ጎበዝ እና ሳቢ እንዲሆኑ ያነሳሳቸዋል (Toto, 2004)."" This directly links the need to satisfy the audience to students becoming better writers. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በይነመረብ ላይ ለሚገኙ ቁሳቁሶች በተደጋጋሚ ምላሽ መስጠት:** While the passage mentions responding to online materials, it's presented as a result of using blogs, not the initial motivation for improving writing.
*   **B: ነቀፌታን የማራቅ ጥልቅ ፍላጎት:** The passage states students improve their writing to *avoid* criticism, not because they enjoy it.
*   **D: የመተባበር አስፈላጊነት:** Collaboration is mentioned as a benefit of blogging, but not as the primary reason for improving writing.

ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ ለተማሪዎች በተላያየ ጊዜ የሚደረግ ንግግር ጥቅም ያልሆነው የትኛው ነው? ,"The correct answer is **B: በቀኑ ማንኛውም ሰዓት ላይ የአስተማሪዎች የፊት-ለ-ፊት ተደራሽነት**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that asynchronous communication allows students to ask questions and get *reasonable* responses at any time, but it doesn't guarantee *face-to-face* access to instructors at any time.**  In fact, it contrasts this with *having to wait* for the next face-to-face interaction.
* The passage *does* highlight the following as benefits of asynchronous learning:
    * **A: በይነመረብን እንደ ግብዓት መጠቀም** - The passage mentions access to information anytime.
    * **C: ምቹ የስራ ሰዓታት** -  The passage states it allows flexible work schedules.
    * **D: የፍጥነት ቁጥጥር** - The passage says students can work at their own pace and control the pace of the process.

Therefore, option B is the only one that is *not* a benefit of asynchronous communication as described in the text."

Here's why:

The passage highlights the benefits of asynchronous learning (learning that doesn't happen in real-time). It states that it allows students to work at their own pace and control the pace of the process. However, the passage *doesn't* mention any drawbacks regarding instructional material. In fact, the passage focuses on how readily available information is through online resources. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የመማር ፍጥነት (Learning pace):** The passage explicitly states asynchronous learning *benefits* from allowing students to work at their own pace.
*   **B: የስራ ሰዓታት (Working hours):** The passage mentions flexible deadlines that accommodate different work schedules – a benefit, not a drawback.
*   **D: የበይነመረብ አጠቃቀም (Internet usage):** The passage highlights the internet as a benefit, providing access to information and quick responses from instructors.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses medieval castles** and elements associated with them like tournaments, food halls, and a sense of history/warfare.
* **A joust (or tilting tournament)** was a *very* common and iconic activity held at castles – a display of knightly skill and combat. It directly fits the context of the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Dungeon:** While mentioned in the passage, it's a *part* of a castle, not something one would associate *with* a castle in the same way a joust is.
* **C: Chivalry:** This is a *code of conduct* associated with knights, not a physical element.
* **D: Knights:**  Similar to chivalry, knights *inhabited* castles, but aren’t a feature *of* a castle in the same direct way as a joust.

Therefore, a joust is the most fitting addition someone could associate with a medieval castle, given the passage's themes.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions the smells and sounds of:

*   **ጦርነቶች (Warfare):** ""ድሮ የነበሩትን ጦርነቶች ድምፆች እና ሽታዎች""
*   **ፍርሃት (Fear):** ""ከእስር ቤት ጉድጓዶች የተነሳውን ፍርሃት ማሽተት""
*   **ሸኮናዎች (Clatter of hooves):** ""ኮረቶቹ ላይ የኮቴዎቹን ጫጫታ መስማት""

The passage does *not* mention anything about the smell or sound of feasts or banquets. Therefore, የማዕድ ገበታ is the answer that wasn't mentioned in the paragraph."

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that in the 1480s, when construction began under Lord Hastings, ""a relative peace existed in the country... defense was only needed against petty thieves."" This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage states the walls were *thin* (not thick), suggesting Lord Hastings didn't prioritize strong defenses.
*   **C:** The passage states the building was ""typical for the period"" (""for the time, was more embellished than a real fortress"").
*   **D:** The passage specifically says the design ""could not have withstood a sustained attack."""

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the design of Kirby Muxloe (large windows and thin walls) *wouldn't* withstand a prolonged attack. It was built during a relatively peaceful time and only needed to defend against minor raids. This implies it *didn't* have a foundation built to withstand serious sieges - making a strong, defensive foundation an unusual feature for that time and that building.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ትላልቅ መስኮቶች** – The passage specifically mentions the large windows as a feature of the house.
*   **C: ከተወሰኑ ቤተ መንግስቶች አንጻር ያነሰ መከላከያ** – The text states it was built with minimal defense in mind because of the peaceful era.
*   **D: ቀጭን ግድግዳዎች** – The passage also explicitly mentions the thin walls as a design choice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: በጋ ላይ አገር አቋራጭ ሩጫ መለማመድ (Practicing cross-country running in the summer):** While cross-country is running, the passage specifically discusses preparation *during the winter* and building a base.
* **B: በልምምድ ላይ ሳሉ ፍጥነትን በማበልጸግ ላይ ማተኮር (Focusing on increasing speed in practice):** The passage says speed is less important in the transition to a half-mile race and endurance is key.
* **C: የሶስት ደቂቃ ጊዜን ማሻሻል (Improving a three-minute time):** This focuses on specific performance/speed rather than the foundational endurance the passage advocates.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ፍጥነት በጣም ያነሰ ጠቀሜታ ያለው እና ጽናት ፍጹም አስፈላጊ ይሆናል።"" (Speed is less important and endurance is absolutely essential.)  It emphasizes that as the distance increases from a quarter mile to a half mile, endurance becomes the key factor.
* **The passage also mentions:** While a good half-miler needs *some* speed, stamina is crucial for success.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: በክረምት ወራቶች ጊዜ አገር አቋራጭ ሩጫን መለማመድ (Practicing cross-country running during the winter months):**  While cross-country training can be helpful, the passage specifically suggests combining winter running with *gym work* for overall preparation.
* **C: ከሁለት ደቂቃዎች በታች ጊዜ ማስቆጠር (Achieving a time under two minutes):** The passage uses a two-minute time as an example of someone with a certain level of speed, but doesn't suggest it's the *goal* or most important aspect for a half-mile runner.
* **D: ከብርታት ይልቅ ፍጥነትን ማበልጸግ (Focusing on speed rather than endurance):** This is the *opposite* of what the passage recommends.

Here's why:

The passage states that good nutrition *alone* can't deliver superior performance, but significantly impacts overall well-being. This implies that performance improvement requires more than just diet – things like training, technique, and other factors are crucial.  It specifically emphasizes that nutrition supports performance *and* enjoyment of the sport.

*   **A: የተሻሻለ አፈጻጸም (Improved performance)** – The passage says nutrition *helps* improve performance, even if it's not the sole factor.
*   **B: የጨመረ ደስታ (Increased enjoyment)** – The passage explicitly states that good nutrition can help athletes enjoy their sport more.
*   **D: አጠቃላይ ጤናማነት (Overall well-being)** – The passage directly links nutrition to overall wellness.
*   **C: የምጡቅ አፈጻጸም (Peak performance)** - While good nutrition contributes, reaching peak performance needs a combination of factors, not just diet. This is what the passage subtly indicates.

Therefore, reaching ""peak performance"" is the one outcome that the passage suggests cannot be achieved through dietary habits *alone*."

Here's why:

The passage states that good nutrition *doesn't* guarantee superior performance on its own, but impacts overall well-being and helps athletes enjoy the sport more. Options A, C, and D (proper nutrition, fluid intake, and energy balance) are all directly mentioned as beneficial practices. Option B, striving for high-level performance, is presented as something that isn't solely achieved through nutrition, but is a positive outcome *influenced* by it, alongside enjoyment of the sport.

Therefore, the passage implies that focusing solely on top-tier performance isn't the direct path to greater enjoyment in sports, while the other options are key elements to help achieve both better performance *and* enjoyment."

Here's why:

The passage states that many running products have ""negligible or no real impact on performance,"" yet athletes might still choose to buy them. It suggests they might be swayed even when there are ""no genuine benefits."" This implies the purchase isn't based on practicality or proven results, but rather on personal choice or potentially being misled.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: የተረጋገጡ ጥቅሞች ስላሉት (Because of proven benefits):** The passage *explicitly* says many products lack proven benefits.
*   **C: በአፈጻጸማቸው ላይ በትልቁ ተጽዕኖ ያመጣል (It has a major impact on their performance):**  This contradicts the passage's main point.
*   **D: ዋጋቸው ያነሰ መሳሪያዎችን አስመልክቶ የተሳሳቱ አመለካከቶች አሉ (There are misconceptions about less expensive equipment):** While the passage mentions misconceptions, it doesn't say this is *why* athletes buy expensive items. It suggests they're swayed even when there are no real benefits.

Here's why:

The passage states that while middle-distance running isn't equipment-intensive compared to other sports, there are ""few pieces of gear around which numerous misconceptions exist."" This implies that the amount of equipment *needed* is actually quite small, even if people *think* they need a lot. The passage also emphasizes that much of the gear marketed to runners has minimal impact on performance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ብዙ መሳሪያ** - The passage contradicts this, saying it's *not* equipment-intensive.
*   **B: የጸና የአትሌት ልምድ** - While important, the passage doesn't focus on experience but on *equipment*.
*   **D: ብዙ ገንዘብ** - The passage implies money is spent unnecessarily on gear, not that it's fundamentally required.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that understanding others' **reasons** (which are closely tied to their **purpose**) is valuable because it helps us interpret ambiguous physical actions. The example given – breaking a car window – illustrates how understanding the *purpose* behind the action (stealing vs. trying to unlock a locked car) changes our interpretation.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: ፍላጎት (Desire):** While desire can motivate actions, the passage focuses on *why* someone would do something, not simply what they *want*.
*   **C: እምነት (Belief):** Beliefs can influence actions, but the passage highlights the need to understand the intention or goal.
*   **D: ግንዛቤ (Awareness):** Awareness is being conscious, but doesn’t directly explain why someone does something.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that understanding others' reasoning helps us ""to decipher ambiguous physical acts."" The example of the person breaking the car window illustrates this perfectly – understanding *why* someone is breaking a window (attempted theft vs. locked keys) clarifies the meaning of the act itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ፍላጎቶችን መገመት (Guessing desires)** - While understanding reasoning can *lead* to understanding desires, the passage focuses on understanding the *cause* of actions, not just what someone wants.
*   **C: ሌሎች ሰዎችን ሳይዳኙ ማየት (Seeing others without judging them)** - The passage doesn't discuss judgment.
*   **D: የሌሎችን አዕምሮ ማንበብ (Reading others' minds)** - The passage discusses a highly developed capacity for understanding others, but frames it as reasoning about their motivations, not literally ""reading minds"".

*   **B: ድምጽ መለየት (Speech recognition)** - Speech recognition is *one application* of AI, not its primary aim.

The passage states that AI includes ""the ability to respond to customer inquiries and questions.""  It also mentions its widespread use in economics, medicine, engineering, and defense, implying practical applications like customer service are common. While the other options are mentioned as examples of AI capabilities, customer service is highlighted as a core function and a key area of application.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: እቅድ ማውጣት እና የጊዜ ሰሌዳ ማውጣት (Planning and scheduling):**  This is *an example* of what AI can do, but not its primary association.
*   **C: ሳይንሳዊ ልቦለድ (Scientific psychology):** The passage states AI *has a strong overlap with* scientific psychology, but it isn't what AI is most often connected to in practice.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that convergent thinkers are good at ""አስተውለው ችግሮችን ይፈታሉ፣ እና ሳይንሳዊ ፈተናዎች ላይ ይሠራሉ።"" This means they excel at recognizing patterns and applying established methods (holding them in their minds) to solve problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ለአንድ ችግር ከአንድ በላይ ትክክለኛ መልሶችን መለየት** - Convergent thinking focuses on *one* correct answer, not multiple.
*   **B: ለአንድ ችግር አዲስ ዘዴዎችን መተግበር** - This is more characteristic of divergent thinking.
*   **C: ችግሮችን ለመፍታት ጊዜያቸውን መውሰድ** - While thoughtful, the text emphasizes speed, logic, and accuracy, suggesting efficiency rather than taking a lot of time.

The passage explicitly states the focuses of convergent thinking are:

*   Distinguishing facts
*   Reapplying old techniques
*   Gathering information

Taking someone's time isn't related to these core elements of convergent thinking. In fact, convergent thinking often prioritizes *speed* in finding a solution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: አንድ መልስ ብቻ እንዳለ መረዳት** - The passage highlights that a key reason convergent thinking is valuable is because there is only one correct answer.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on *microexpressions*:** These are *brief, involuntary* facial expressions that reveal true emotions. They happen in fractions of a second.
* **Options A, B, and C** all describe quick, potentially subconscious movements that *could* be microexpressions:
    * **A: እየተናገሩ እያለ ወደ ሌላ አየት ማድረግ (Looking away while speaking):**  Can indicate discomfort or deception.
    * **B: ቅንድብ ማጨማደድ (Tapping fingers):** Can indicate nervousness.
    * **C: በፍጥነት አይንን ማርገብገብ (Rapid blinking):** Can be a sign of stress or lying.
* **Option D: አውራ ጣት ወደ ላይ መስጠት (Raising a pinky finger):** This is a deliberate, conscious action, not a fleeting, involuntary expression. It's a gesture with cultural meaning (often associated with sophistication or pretentiousness) but doesn't fit the definition of a microexpression as described in the passage.

The passage highlights how subtle, *involuntary* cues reveal truthfulness. Raising a pinky is an intentional act and therefore wouldn't be considered a microexpression."

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the *interpretations* of micro-expressions derived from video recordings, not the prosperity the recordings themselves have brought.** It details how analyzing these tiny facial cues can potentially reveal deception and how people with brain damage could still detect sincerity.
* **B is true:** The passage states that accurately interpreting micro-expressions *can* help determine if someone is lying.
* **C is true:** The passage mentions both translating facial movements and Oliver Sacks' example deals with understanding the *meaning* behind speech (even if someone can't process the words themselves).
* **D is true:**  The entire premise of the passage is that micro-expression interpretation can aid in assessing trustworthiness.

Therefore, option A is the only statement not supported by the information presented in the passage."

This directly indicates that the Renaissance shifted the focus *to* remembering and recalling information from texts, making it the most significant change described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ግፊት በተናጠል (Rote memorization):** The passage says this *decreased* in importance, not increased.
*   **B: እውቀትን ማዘዋወር (Knowledge dissemination):** While the Renaissance did impact knowledge dissemination, the passage focuses on the *method* of learning and acquiring knowledge, not just spreading it.
*   **D: መረጃ ማግኘት (Information access):** The passage mentions information access changed, but it emphasizes the *way* information was stored and recalled (through text) rather than just the access itself.

The passage explicitly states that knowledge acquisition shifted *away* from memorization and *towards* remembering text. It says ""ከእንግዲህ ግፊት በተናጠል በማስታወስ ውስጥ አልነበረም"" which translates to ""From now on it was no longer about memorization by heart"". This means rote memorization received *less* emphasis during the Renaissance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ዕውቀት ማግኘት (knowledge acquisition):** The passage says the *way* knowledge was acquired changed, but not that knowledge acquisition itself was less emphasized.
* **C: የጽሑፍ መልሶ ጥሪ (recalling text):** The passage specifically says this became *more* important.
* **D: የመረጃ ክፍፍል (information dissemination):** The passage states the Renaissance brought significant change in how knowledge was *disseminated* (spread), implying it *was* emphasized.

The passage focuses on how the internet *facilitates relationships and connection*. Let's break down why each option fits or doesn't:

*   **A: የንግድ ትስስር (Business networking):**  The internet is *very* commonly used to build and maintain professional relationships.
*   **B: ከቤተሰብ ጋር ግንኙነት መቀጠል (Staying connected with family):**  This is a classic example of how the internet strengthens existing bonds, directly aligning with the passage's themes.
*   **D: አዲስ ሰዎችን መተዋወቅ (Meeting new people):**  Social media, online forums, and dating apps all demonstrate the internet's ability to forge new connections.
*   **C: ጉዞ ማጥናት (Planning a trip):** While you can *use* the internet to plan a trip, the act of planning itself doesn't inherently *foster relationships or ongoing connection* with others. It's a logistical task, not a relational one.

Therefore, planning a trip is the only option that doesn’t directly relate to maintaining or building interpersonal connections, making it the correct answer."

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes ""personal involvement""** as a key motivator for internet use. This implies activities where users are actively engaging with their own interests, opinions, or identity.

Let's look at why the other options *do* encourage personal involvement:

* **A: የምግብ አሰራር መመልከት (Looking at recipes):** This can involve choosing recipes based on personal preferences, dietary needs, or cooking skill level – showing personal investment.
* **B: በመስመር ላይ የውይይት ሰሌዳ ላይ መለጠፍ (Posting on an online discussion forum):**  This *directly* requires sharing personal thoughts, opinions, and engaging with others, representing high personal involvement.
* **C: ጤና ነክ ምርቶችን ማጥናት (Researching health products):** This is driven by personal health concerns and making informed decisions about one's own well-being.

* **D: ገንዘብን ማስተዳደር (Managing finances):** While important, it's primarily a *functional* task.  It's less about expressing personality or engaging with personal interests and more about managing obligations. It can be done very impersonally.



Therefore, managing finances stands out as the activity least likely to be driven by the “personal involvement” motivator described in the passage."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **C: ከመካከለኛው ክፍለ ዘመን 25 አመታት በኋላ** - The passage mentions a 25-30 year delay in trends *reaching* the West, not when they started their own style.
*   **D: በ 11ኛው ክፍለ ዘመን** - The passage indicates Gothic style was prominent between the 10th and 11th centuries, but doesn't say this is when Western Europe began developing its own style. It actually states the shift happened later, at the *end* of the Middle Ages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የጎቲክ ክፍለ ጊዜ (Gothic period):** While the Gothic period *saw* the use of clasps, it doesn't explain where the practice originated.
*   **B: የቤዛንታይን ዘመን (Byzantine era):** The passage states that early garments were heavily influenced by Byzantine culture, but doesn't say clasps/buttons came *from* there.
*   **D: መካከለኛው ክፍለ ዘመን (Medieval period):** This is too broad. The passage pinpoints a specific reason (the Crusades) within the Medieval period.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically identifies overpopulation and unsustainable lifestyles as core problems.**  It mentions the changes brought about by scientific and technological advances *and* the impact of human population and excessive lifestyles.
* **Option A directly addresses this root cause.** Avoiding unsustainable lifestyle choices tackles the problem at its source.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that joining environmental movements, living more sustainably, and advocating for change are like ""palliative treatment"" - meaning they treat the *symptoms* of the problem. However, it goes on to say that if we want more than a temporary fix, we need to address the *root causes*.

Therefore, **finding and eliminating the root causes** isn't a symptomatic treatment; it's the deeper, long-term solution the passage advocates for. The other options (A, C, and D) all fall under the category of ""palliative treatment"" as described in the text."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: የመቶ አመቱ ጦርነት (The Hundred Years' War):** This occurred much earlier and while religion played *a* role, it wasn't primarily a religious conflict.
* **C: የስፔን ተተኪነት (The War of the Spanish Succession):** The passage mentions this as the first war *centered* on the balance of power, but doesn't label it as a religious war.

ከሚከተሉት የካቶሊክ ቤተ ክርስቲያን ክፍሎች ውስጥ በጥብቅ ያልተመረመረው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: በቤተ ክርስቲያኑ ውስጥ የሀብት ክፍፍል ተገቢ መሆኑ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ከዋና ዋና ክርስቲያናዊ መሠረተ ሐሳቦች አንዱ ሀብትን መከራን እና ድህነትን ለማቃለል ጥቅም ላይ መዋል አለበት የሚለው ሲሆን የቤተ ክርስቲያኒቱ የገንዘብ ፈንድ በተለየ ለዚህ ምክንያት የተመደበ ነው።"" This means the *idea* of wealth distribution is acknowledged and practiced to some extent. Therefore, it's not the area under scrutiny.
* **The passage focuses on questioning whether the Church is *living up* to its principles:** It highlights concerns that the accumulation of power and wealth is making people question if the core tenets of Christianity are being followed (helping the poor, alleviating suffering).  This directly addresses options B, C, and D.
* **Options B, C, and D all reflect a critical examination of the Church's actions:**
    * **B:** Whether the core principles need to be changed is a consequence of questioning the Church's performance.
    * **C:**  The passage directly states the power accumulation is causing scrutiny.
    * **D:**  The passage explicitly asks if the core principles are *being fulfilled*.

Therefore, option A is the one aspect of the Catholic Church that the passage does *not* present as being under investigation or question."
በምንባቡ መሰረት ቨርሳይስ ላይ የተገደሉት ማን ነበሩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ከገበያተኞቹ አንዷ ሴት**.

The passage states: "" በአንድ ወቅት አንድ የስብስብ ቡድን አባል በተደናገጠችው ንግሥት ፊት በቬርሳይለስ ላይ የተገደለውን የንጉሣዊ ዘበኛ ጭንቅላት እያውለበለበ ነበር።"" This directly translates to ""At one point, a member of the group was waving the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen."" The member of the group is identified as one of the market women.



"
ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ በስብስብ ቡድኑ በንጉሱ እና ንግስቷ ላይ ያልተገደደው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: ከቨርሳይስ በድንገት መውጣት**.

Here's why:

* **A: የሰረገላ መስኮቶቻቸው መከፈት** - The passage explicitly states the mob *forced* them to have the carriage windows opened.
* **C: የጋርዱ አንገት ሲቀላ ማየት** - The passage details a member of the crowd displaying a guard's head to the Queen.
* **D: ወደ ፓሪስ መመለስ ጉዞ** - The passage states they were *forced* to return to Paris.
* **B: ከቨርሳይስ በድንገት መውጣት** - While they *did* leave Versailles, the passage doesn't say they left suddenly. It states they were *compelled* to leave by the mob, but not that the departure was rushed or unexpected *to them* at that moment.  They were taken by the mob.

Therefore, the only action not explicitly stated as being *done to* the King and Queen by the mob is a sudden departure from Versailles.

ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ የብሪታኒያ ያልተለመደ የባህር ኃይል ጦርነት ውጤት ያልሆነው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: በአለም አቀፍ ህግ ላይ ለውጥ ተደርጓል**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Britain's blockade *violated* international law**, but it doesn't say this led to any changes in that law. It simply states the blockade was a breach of existing, well-established rules.
* **A: የጀርመን ተመሳሳይ የጦርነት ታክቲኮችን መዘርጋት** - The passage directly states Germany responded with unrestricted submarine warfare, mirroring Britain's tactics.
* **B: ተሳትፎ ያልነበራቸው መርከቦች ወደ ጉዳት ተመርተዋል** - The text explicitly mentions neutral ships were endangered by Britain's mining of international waters.
* **D: አስፈላጊ ግብዓቶች ተደራሽ መሆን አልቻሉም** - The passage notes the blockade *was* effective in cutting off military and civil supplies.

Therefore, the only outcome *not* described in the passage is a change to international law."
የትኛው መግለጫ ነው የብሪታኒያ የጀርመን ባህር ኃይል እገዳን በትክክል የማይገልጸው?,"The correct answer is **D: ገለልተኛ መርከቦች ለአደጋ አለመጋለጣቸውን አረጋግጧል**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Britain's blockade *did* endanger neutral ships: ""This also endangered even neutral ships.""  Therefore, claiming it ensured their safety is the statement that *doesn't* accurately reflect the information provided.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: አለም አቀፍ ህግን የተላለፈ ነበር** - The passage directly states the blockade ""violated generally accepted international law.""
*   **B: የጀርመንን የባህር ሰርጓጅ ጦርነት አነሳስቷል** - The passage says Germany retaliated with unrestricted submarine warfare, which was a direct response to the blockade.
*   **C: የጀርመን አቅርቦቶች ፍሰትን አቋርጧል** - The passage states the blockade was effective in ""cutting off vital military and civil supplies.""

በምንባቡ መሰረት ከአንድ በላይ ስክለሮሲስ በምርመራ ሊገኝ የሚችልበት እድል የሚሰፋው ለማን ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: የ 32 አመት ሴት (A 32-year-old woman)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.""
* **The passage also states:** MS affects ""young to middle-aged adults"".

A 32-year-old woman fits both criteria: she is female *and* within the typical age range for MS onset.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: የ 15 አመት ወንድ (A 15-year-old male):** While MS *can* occur in younger people, it's less common. Also, males are less susceptible.
* **C: የ 43 አመት ወንድ (A 43-year-old male):** He is within the age range but is male, and therefore less likely.
* **D: የ 10 አመት ሴት (A 10-year-old female):** MS is rare in children."
በምንባቡ መሰረት በመደበኛ እንቅስቃሴ ላይ ያሉ ተሳታፊዎች ይበልጥ ድጋፍ ያስፈለጋቸውን ለምን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **A: የህመም አሉታዊ አረዳድ (Negative pain appraisal)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that people who regularly exercise ""need help with appraising pain in a negative way."" This negative appraisal is what contributes to chronic pain and difficulty distinguishing it from normal discomfort after exercise.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: የታችኛው ጀርባ (Lower back)**: While the study *focuses* on lower back pain sufferers, the question asks why exercise participants needed support, not what part of the body the study is about.
*   **C: ጭንቀት (Anxiety)**: The text mentions anxiety (fear) as a factor in the initial problem, but the support needed by exercise participants is specifically about their *perception* of pain.
*   **D: ፍርሃት (Fear)**:  Similar to anxiety, fear is a contributing factor to the problem studied, but not the reason for needing help with exercise.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት ሻሞላ አብዛኛውን ጊዜ የሚጫወቱቱ እንዴት ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: በፍልሚያ መልክ**

Here's why:

The passage states ""ስፖርቱ በዋናነት፣ አንዱ ባለጎራዴ ሌላው ጋር እየተፋለመ፣ በፍልሚያ መልክ ይካሄዳል።"" This directly translates to ""The sport is mainly played as a competition, with one fencer fighting against another.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በዘመናዊ መልክ** - While the passage mentions ""ዘመናዊ የሻቦላ ግጥሚያ"" (modern fencing), it doesn't describe *how* it's played.
*   **B: በዩኒቨርሲቲ ደረጃ** - The passage mentions university students play, but it doesn't say this is how it's *usually* played.
*   **C: በኦሎምፒክ ደረጃ** - Similar to university level, the passage mentions the Olympics, but doesn't say it's the standard way fencing happens.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""the best clue that a poisoning has occurred may be the presence of an open medication or household chemicals.""  A prescribed medication falls into the category of ""medication"" mentioned in the text, and its presence suggests a potential source of poisoning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ማቅለሽለሽ እና ትኩሳት (Nausea and fever)** - These are very general symptoms and the passage specifically says symptoms like these are not reliable indicators because they're too common.
*   **B: ማስመለስ እና ማላብ (Vomiting and dizziness)** -  Again, these are common symptoms that don't definitively point to poisoning.
*   **C: ከባድ ቁርጠት እና የሆድ ህመም (Severe cramping and stomach pain)** - While serious, these can have many causes other than poisoning.

በምንባቡ መሰረት ጉዳተኛ ሲገመገም የመጀመሪያው ተገቢ እርምጃ ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ትዕይንቱን መቃኘት**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""To check on a patient's well-being, you must first scan the surroundings to ensure your own safety."" This directly corresponds to **scanning the scene** before approaching the patient.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ጉዳተኛውን መጠጋት (Touching the patient)** - The passage emphasizes assessing the situation *before* approaching.
*   **C: የተጎጂዎች ቦታ ማጣራት (Identifying injured areas)** - This is a step *after* ensuring your own safety and approaching.
*   **D: እርዳታ መጠበቅ (Calling for help)** - While important, it's not the *first* step as described in the passage. The first step is self-assessment and scene assessment.



"
ከሚከተሉት መግለጫዎች ውስጥ ተጎጂን የመገምገም ሂደት በትክክል የማይገልጸው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: የራስዎን ጉዳቶች መንከባከብ ግድ አይበልዎት** (You don't need to take care of your own safety).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the importance of ensuring your own safety *first* before approaching a victim.**  It emphasizes that you need to scan the environment to ensure *your* well-being before attempting to help. Option A directly contradicts this crucial step.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: ከተጎጂው አስቀድሞ ትዕይንቱን ይገምግሙ** (Survey the scene before approaching the victim) - The passage says to ""scan the environment"" first, which is surveying the scene.
* **C: የተጎጂውን ቦታ ይመልከቱ** (Identify the nature of the injury) - The passage mentions recognizing ""the injured area.""
* **D: ማናቸውንም ልብ የሚባሉ ነገሮች ያስተውሉ** (Note any immediate dangers) -  The passage refers to recognizing ""any serious hazards.""

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""The French Revolution inspired many working-class people in other countries to begin their own uprisings."" This demonstrates the spread of revolutionary ideals, specifically republicanism (the idea of a government based on the people, not a monarch), which directly impacted and motivated the working class.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: ለሀገር የጨመረ ድጋፍ (Increased support for the country):** While nationalism *could* be a result, the passage focuses on the *inspiration* for uprising, not simply increased national feeling.
* **B: ከመደብ ወደ ውጤት አምጪነት የትኩረት መቀየር (Shift from class to meritocracy):** The passage mentions opportunities opening up based on ability (""merit""), but doesn't say there was a fundamental shift *away* from class consciousness.
* **D: አዲስ የመስፈሪያ ስርዓት (A new conscription system):** The change in military structure is mentioned, but it's a logistical change – not one that fundamentally alters the working class’s experience or worldview.

Here's why:

The passage states that after the French Revolution, military advancement was based on **caliber** (skill and merit) rather than social class (""based on caliber rather than on rank""). This shift opened up opportunities for success in the military and other professions to all men, regardless of their background.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ስኬት (Success)** - While success is a result, it's not the *reason* advancement became possible.
*   **B: መደብ (Class)** - The passage explicitly states the revolution moved *away* from class-based advancement.
*   **C: ጥማት (Thirst/Desire)** - While desire might motivate people, it wasn't the structural change that *allowed* success.

ባደጉ አገራት ውስጥ በጣም ቅሬታ ይፈጥራል ተብሎ የሚነገርለት የሕዝብ አገልግሎት የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: የህዝብ ትራንስፖርት (Public transport)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""ሁሉም ሰው ማለት ይቻላል ስለ መጓጓዣ ስርዓቶች ቅሬታ ያቀርባል።"" (Almost everyone complains about transportation systems).  It then contrasts this with complaints about water quality and bridge collapses *sometimes* occurring in developed countries. The primary focus of the passage is the widespread dissatisfaction with transport.

Therefore, public transport is the service most consistently mentioned as causing complaints in the provided text.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ሁሉም ሰው ማለት ይቻላል ስለ መጓጓዣ ስርዓቶች ቅሬታ ያቀርባል።"" (Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.) This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የሚጠቀማቸው ሰው ሁሉ በሚገባ ይወደዳሉ (They are well-liked by everyone who uses them)** - The passage contradicts this.
*   **B: እንደ ውሀ ጥራት የከፉ አይደሉም (They are not worse than water quality)** - While the passage mentions water quality as another source of complaints, it doesn't compare the *level* of complaints between the two.
*   **D: በአብዛኛው ያደጉት ሀገራት ውስጥ ነጻ ናቸው (They are mostly free in developed countries)** - The passage does not mention the cost of transportation systems.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""የትራፊክ ፍሰትን ማጥናት ከባድ ነው። እንደ አለመታደል ሆኖ የሹፌርን ባህሪ መቶ በመቶ በእርግጠኝነት መተንበይ ስለማይቻል...""  This directly links the difficulty of predicting traffic flow to the unpredictable nature of drivers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: የትራፊክ ፍጥነት (Traffic Speed):** While driver behavior *influences* speed, speed itself is a measurable output *of* traffic flow, not the core challenge caused by unpredictability.
* **B: የመንገድ እቅድ (Road Planning):** Road planning relies on understanding traffic flow, but the unpredictability doesn't make planning impossible; it just requires accounting for variations.
* **C: የመንገድ ክንውኖች (Road Changes):**  Road changes might *affect* traffic flow, but aren't directly caused by the inability to predict driver behavior.



"
ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ የትራፊክ ፍሰት በሒሳብ ሲገለጽ የሚያገለግለው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: የትራፊክ ጥግግት (Traffic Density)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that traffic flow is related to three main characteristics: **flow, density, and speed.** The question asks what traffic flow is represented *by* in mathematical terms. Density (ጥግግት) is one of those key characteristics used in calculating and representing traffic flow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የመንገድ ክንውኖች (Road changes)** - While road changes can *affect* traffic flow, they don't represent how it's mathematically expressed.
*   **B: የሹፌር ባህሪ (Driver behavior)** - The passage notes that predicting driver behavior is *difficult* and why modeling traffic flow is challenging. It doesn't represent the mathematical expression.
*   **C: የመንገድ ንድፍ (Road design)** - Road design influences traffic flow, but isn't the way it's quantified.

ሀርሺ እና ቼስ ዲኤንኤያቸውን ለመትከል የተጠቀሙት ምንድን ነው? ,"The correct answer is **D: ቫይረሶች**.

Here's why:

The text states that Hershey and Chase used **bacteriophages (viruses)** to introduce their DNA into the bacteria. They didn't *directly* use radioactive phosphorus or sulfur to introduce the DNA, but rather used viruses *labeled* with those substances.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ራድዮ አክቲቭ ፎስፈረስ:** While they *used* radioactive phosphorus, it wasn't the *method* of delivery. It was used to label the DNA within the viruses.
*   **B: የዘረመል ቁስ:** This is a general term for DNA, but doesn't describe what they *used* to get the DNA into the bacteria.
*   **C: ራዲዮ አክቲቭ ሰልፈር:** Similar to radioactive phosphorus, this was used for labeling the protein part of the viruses, not the method of delivery for the DNA.



"
ቅይርታ ወደ ዘር እንዲተላለፍ የሚመረኮዝበት ነገር ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ህዋሶች የጀርም-መስመር ከሆኑ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""የጀርም መስመር ያላቸው ህዋሶች ላይ የሚደረግ ቅይርታ ብቻ ወደ ህፃናት ሊተላለፍ ይችላል...""  This directly links transmission to the germline (ዘር-መስመር) nature of the cells.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: የዘረመል ቁሱ አስፈላጊነት:** While the size of the affected genetic material *influences* the effect of a mutation, it doesn't determine *whether* it's heritable.
* **C: የቅይርታው አይነት:** The type of mutation also influences the effect, but not heritability.
* **D: ቅይርታው የህዋስ-ሞትን ማስከተል የሚችል ከሆነ:** Whether a mutation causes cell death is irrelevant to whether it's passed on to offspring.  In fact, mutations causing cell death *won't* be passed on.

Here's why:

The passage states mutation impacts differ based on:

*   **Type of mutation**
*   **Importance of the affected genetic material**
*   **Whether the affected cells are germline cells**

It doesn't mention that the *extent* or *amount* of genetic material affected influences the different impacts.  The passage focuses on *what* is changed, *where* it is changed, and *how important* what's changed is, not *how much* is changed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ተጽዕኖ የደረሰባቸው ህዋሶች የጀርም-መስመር መሆናቸው** - This *is* a factor determining the impact, as the passage explicitly states germline mutations can be inherited.
*   **C: ተጽዕኖ የደረሰበት የዘረመል ቁስ አስፈላጊነት** - This *is* a factor, as the passage says the importance of the affected genetic material matters.
*   **D: ተጽዕኖ የደረሰበት የቅይርታ አይነት** - This *is* a factor, as the passage states different types of mutations have different effects.

The passage specifically states ancient cultures kept goats for:

*   **Milk** (""ወተት"")
*   **Hair** (""ፀጉር"")
*   **Meat** (""ሥጋ"")
*   **Hides** (""ቆዳዎች"")

There is no mention of goats being kept to help with farming or tending to the land (""መሬቱን በመጋጥ""). 

The other options (A, C, and D) are all reasons provided in the text for keeping goats. While goats *might* have some incidental benefits related to land clearing, it wasn't a primary reason for domestication according to this passage.
"
የጎልፍ ግብ የምንን አነስተኛ መጠን ማግኘት ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: ምቶች (strokes)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ሜዳውን ለመጨረስ፣ ጥቂቶቹን ምቶች ወይም የዱላ ምቶች የወሰደው ተጫዋች ያሸንፋ።"" (To finish the course, the player who took the fewest strokes wins.) 

This directly links the goal of golf to achieving the lowest number of strokes.



"
በጎልፍ ሜዳ ላይ ሳር አጥሮ የሚቆረጠው የት ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: አረንጓዴው ላይ**.

The passage states: ""በጉድጓዱ ዙሪያ ያለው ሳር በአጭሩ ይቆረጣል እና አረንጓዴው ተብሎ ይጠራል።"" This directly answers the question."
የሙከራ የተለመደ አላማ ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: አንድ ወይም ከዚያ በላይ ሊሆኑ የሚችሉ መላምቶችን ማስወገድ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...ሙከራ አንድ ወይም ከዚያ በላይ መላ ምቶችን ለማስወገድ የሚጠቅም ፈተና ነው..."" This directly answers the question of the purpose of experimentation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: አለም እንዴት እንደሚሰራ ለማወቅ** - This is the overall goal of science (according to the passage), not specifically the goal of *experimentation*.
*   **C: ጥያቄዎችን ለማስነሳት** - While experiments can *lead* to new questions, their primary purpose isn't to ask them.
*   **D: ሳይንሳዊ ምርምርን ለመምራት** - The passage states experimentation *guides* scientific study, but it's not the sole aim of a single experiment.

Here's why:

The passage states that the scientific method *guides* research, but *not alone*. It explicitly mentions that experimentation, testing hypotheses, asking questions, and conducting investigations *also* guide scientific study. This implies that relying solely on the scientific method is insufficient.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ምልከታዎችን ማካሄድ (Conducting investigations)** - The passage explicitly states this guides scientific study.
* **C: ሊሆኑ የሚችሉ መላምቶችን ማስወገድ (Eliminating possible answers)** - The passage states this is a useful part of the testing process, which guides research.
* **D: ሙከራዎችን ማከናወን (Performing experiments)** - The passage explicitly states this guides scientific study.

*   **A: አብዛኛውን ጊዜ ከሶስት ሰዓታት በላይ ይቆያሉ** - The passage states *the most intense 2%* of tornadoes last over three hours, not the majority.
*   **B: እስከ 480 ማይል በሰከንድ የሚደርስ ነፋስ ይፈጥራሉ** - The passage states 300 ማይል በሰዓት, not 480 ማይል በሰከንድ.
*   **C: ከሌሎች አደገኛ የአየር ጸባዮች አንጻር ሰፊ ቦታዎችን ይጎዳሉ** - The passage emphasizes that tornadoes hit in *small* areas, despite their destructive power."
ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ ሰዎች በ 16ኛው ክፍለ ዘመን ማድረግ የጀመሩት የትኛውን ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: ቴሌስኮፖችን መስራት**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""የመጀመሪያዎቹ እውነተኛ ቴሌስኮፖች የተሰሩት በአውሮፓ ውስጥ በ16ኛው ክፍለ ዘመን ነበር"" (The first true telescopes were made in Europe in the 16th century).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ሌንሶችን መጠቀም (Using lenses):** The passage says people had been working with and using lenses for *thousands* of years before the 16th century.
* **B: ቁሶችን ማጉላት (Magnifying objects):**  People were magnifying objects with lenses for thousands of years.
* **C: ሌንሶችን መስራት (Making lenses):** People were making lenses for thousands of years.

The 16th century marks the beginning of *telescope* construction, which is a specific application of lenses."
ሰዎች ሌንሶችን በመጠቀም ቁሶችን ማጉላት ከጀመሩ ምን ያህል ጊዜ ሆኗል?,"The correct answer is **C: በሺ ለሚቆጠሩ አመታት**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""ሰዎች በሺዎች ለሚቆጠሩ ዓመታት ሌንሶችን ለማጉላት እየሠሩ እና እየተጠቀሙባቸው ኖረዋል።"" (People have been working with and using lenses to magnify things for thousands of years.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ለሺ አመታት** - While close, the passage explicitly says ""thousands of years"" (በሺዎች ለሚቆጠሩ አመታት).
* **B: ከ 16ኛው ክፍለ ዘመን መጨረሻ አንስቶ** - The passage says telescopes were *invented* in the 16th century, but people were using lenses *before* then.
* **D: ከ 16ኛው ክፍለ ዘመን መጀመሪያ አንስቶ** - Same reasoning as option B; lens use predates the invention of the telescope.

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes that Muhammad sought out the cave (""Hirā'"") to escape from worldly concerns and contemplate.
*   It highlights the cave's remoteness and complete isolation, noting that it’s difficult to find and once inside, you only see a small part of the world. This clearly points to a desire for solitude and a space conducive to spiritual reflection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: የውጭ ድምጽ ለማሰላሰል ይረዳል** - The text emphasizes *lack* of external stimuli, not using it for sound.
*   **C: በጣም ትንሽ የብቻ ጊዜ ነበር ያስፈለጋቸው** - The opposite is true; the passage suggests he deliberately sought significant periods of solitude.
*   **D: ለመታየት እና ለመሰማት በጣም ይጓጉ ነበር** - The cave’s isolation implies a desire to *avoid* being seen or hearing the world.

በምንባቡ መሰረት ብረት ለመጀመሪያ ጊዜ ጥቅም ላይ የዋለው ለምን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **C: ጎማዎች (Wheels)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: "" ቀስ በቀስ ግን ትራኮች ከላይ የብረት ማዕድን ቢኖራቸው የበለጠ ውጤታማ እንደሚሆኑ መገንዘብ ተቻለ።"" This translates to ""Gradually, it was realized that the tracks would be more effective if they had iron ore on top."" This means iron was first used to improve the wheels/tracks of the wagons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: መስቀለኞች (Crossbars)** - While crossbars were used to keep the tracks in place, the passage doesn't say iron was *first* used on them.
*   **B: ፉርጎዎች (Carriages)** - Iron was eventually used in the entire carriage, but not initially.
*   **D: ሀዲዶች (Iron rails)** - Full iron rails weren't introduced until 1767, much later than the first use of iron.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""ቀስ በቀስ ግን ትራኮች ከላይ የብረት ማዕድን ቢኖራቸው የበለጠ ውጤታማ እንደሚሆኑ መገንዘብ ተቻለ"" - meaning they realized metal tracks were *more effective*.  This led to the eventual full replacement of wooden wheels with metal ones.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: የፈረሶቹ ፍጥነት መጨመር** - While metal tracks *allowed* for faster speeds, that wasn't the initial reason for the switch. The passage mentions speed as a result *after* the initial improvement.
* **C: ገዘፍ ያሉ ጭነቶችን ማስተናገድ ይችሉ ነበር** - The passage states the tracks handled larger loads, but this wasn't the primary reason for the change from wood to metal.
* **D: በሀዲዱ ላይ ባለው ብረት ይበሉ ነበር** - The passage states that metal *damaged* the wooden wheels, leading to their replacement – not that they were eaten by the metal.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that during the Romanticism period, **geography** was considered more important than laws, customs, or even cultural rules in shaping individuals. It says geography ""molded individuals and…gave rise to cultures and spontaneous laws aligned with the place of the community.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ህጎች** - The passage states geography was *more* important than laws.
*   **C: ልማዶች** - Similar to laws, customs were superseded by geography.
*   **D: ባህል** - While Romanticism involved a strong cultural component, the passage focuses on geography as the *primary* shaping force.

Here's why:

The passage explains that an ""up stroke"" (የላይ እጥፋት) produces a softer sound, while a ""down stroke"" (የታች እጥፋት) produces a stronger sound. The question asks which option *doesn't* relate to the physical act of strumming, but rather to the *result* of a strum.  A smooth sound is a *result* of an upstroke, not part of the mechanics of the stroke itself.

Let's look at why the other options are related to the strumming action:

*   **B: ስቴፕላር የሚመስል ምልክት** (Stapler-like symbol) - This directly refers to the visual indicator for a downstroke.
*   **C: ጠንካራ ድምጽ** (Strong sound) - This is a result of a downstroke and therefore linked to the strumming action.
*   **D: እንቁራሪቱ ላይ መጀመር** (Starting at the soundhole) - This describes *how* to perform a downstroke, part of the physical action.

The passage explicitly states: ""የታችኛው-ምት ግን የበለጠ ጠንካራ እና የበለጠ አረጋጋጭ ነው።"" which translates to ""The bottom stroke is more forceful and more assertive.""  ""አረጋጋጭ"" means forceful or assertive, implying a stronger sound.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ደጋኑን መሳብ** (Drawing the stroke) - This describes the *action* of playing, not the sound itself.
* **C: V የሚመስል ምልክት** (V-shaped mark) - This refers to the *top* stroke, which the passage states creates a *softer* sound.
* **D: እጅዎ ደጋኑን የያዘበት ቦታ መጀመር** (Starting where your hand holds the bow) - This describes how to play a downward stroke, not the sound it makes.

This directly links the fossil evidence to the development of hands for skilled work.
* **The passage contrasts humans with chimpanzees:** Chimpanzees have hands and feet of similar size, useful for locomotion. Humans have shorter hands with straighter thumbs, suggesting they evolved *away* from using hands for movement and *towards* precision work.
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: ክብደት ለመሸከም** (Carrying weight) - The passage states hominids *don't* primarily use hands for this.
    * **C: ለመንቀሳቀሻ** (Locomotion) - The passage indicates hands evolved *away* from this purpose.
    * **D: በአንጓ ለመራመድ** (Knuckle-walking) -  This is more related to chimpanzees and not the evolutionary path of hominids as described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ከሰው በላይ ቀጥ ያሉ ናቸው (More straight than humans):** The passage says *human* fingers are straighter.
* **B: እጆቻቸው እና እግሮቻቸው በመጠን ይለያያሉ (Their hands and feet differ in size):** The passage specifically states they are the *same* size.
* **D: በዋነኝነት ጥቅም የሚሰጡት የእጅ ሙያ ለመስራት ነው (Primarily used for manual dexterity):** The passage focuses on weight-bearing, not specialized tool use, for chimpanzee hands.

*   **A: የተደበቀ (Hidden)**: The passage states mutations *add* to variation, not selection removing from the hidden pool.
*   **B: ዳግም ውህደት (Recombination)**: Recombination *moves* variation between the pools, it doesn't remove it through selection.
*   **C: መለያየት (Divergence)**: Divergence is the process *creating* difference between the pools, not the removal of variation by selection.

* The other options are incorrect because:
    * **A: መለያየት (Separation):** This describes the movement *between* the pools of variation, not the creation of new variation.
    * **B: ዳግም ውህደት (Recombination):** This also shuffles existing variation, it doesn't *create* new variation.
    * **D: የተገለጹ (Expressed):**  This refers to a type of variation pool, not the process that creates variation.

Here's why:

The passage states that animal foods like ""insects, grubs, and eggs"" provide easily digestible protein with all the necessary amino acids. It then suggests our ancestors likely solved the ""protein problem"" similarly to chimpanzees today, implying insect consumption was a solution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የሞቱ ቅጠሎች** - The passage states that leaves are difficult to digest *unless cooked*.
*   **B: ጥሬ ጥራጥሬዎች** -  Similar to leaves, the passage states that fruits are difficult to digest for hominids unless processed.
*   **D: የአበባ ግንዶች** - This isn't mentioned in the passage as a protein source."

Here's why:

The passage states that the difficulty lies in *digesting* plant proteins to get the necessary amino acids. It doesn't say the *lack* of amino acids causes digestion problems. Rather, the inability to digest plants effectively *leads* to the amino acid deficiency. 

The passage explicitly links amino acid deficiency to:

*   **B: የተመጣጠነ ምግብ እጥረት** (""malnutrition"")
*   **D: ሞት** 
*   **C: የተጨቆነ እድገት** (this is implied by malnutrition and the overall severity of the deficiency)

Therefore, digestion problems are the *cause* of the issue, not a *result* of the amino acid deficiency itself, according to the text."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ለመመሳሰል በመሞከር** - While conformity is *part* of subculture, the passage highlights *how* they show belonging, not just the attempt to fit in.
*   **B: በዙሪያቸው ያሉ ሁሉንም ሰዎች እምነቶች በመልመድ** - Subcultures often *challenge* mainstream beliefs, not simply adopt all of them.

Here's why:

The passage states that children internalize stereotypes about race and these stereotypes *influence behavior*. If a child identifies with a racial group perceived to have negative traits (like not performing well in school), they may start to *act* in ways that confirm that stereotype.  In this case, if a child is part of a group perceived as having ""threatening behavior,"" they are more likely to exhibit that behavior, because they have internalized the associated stereotype.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ልጁ በአስፈሪ ባህሪ ውስጥ ከመሳተፍ ለመቆጠብ ይሞክራል (The child will try to avoid engaging in threatening behavior):** This would be the case if the child *rejected* the stereotype, but the passage says they *internalize* it.
* **C: ልጁ በማህበረሰባዊ ሁኔታዎች ውስጥ ራሱን ያገላል (The child will express themselves in social situations):** This is too general and doesn't relate to the specific impact of negative racial stereotypes.
* **D: ልጁ ከሌሎች አናሳ ዘሮች ጋር ከመሳተፍ ይቆጠባል (The child will avoid interacting with other racial groups):** While this *could* happen, the passage focuses on the impact on the child’s *own* behavior, not their interactions with others.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that children ""internalize"" understandings of race and racial stereotypes, and these attitudes *influence behavior*. The example given directly links a child's understanding of a negative stereotype about their racial identity to their performance in school (a behavior).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: እራሳቸውን ለመመደብ የመረጡትን አናሳ ዘር (The racial identity they choose to identify with):** While awareness of race influences identity, the passage focuses on how *perceived* stereotypes impact behavior, not the choice of identity itself.
*   **C: ከሌሎች ልጆች ጋር ያላቸው ግንኙነት (Their interactions with other children):** The passage doesn't directly state interactions are affected, only that racial attitudes impact behavior.
*   **D: ለብሔር ያላቸው ትርጉም (Their interpretation of race):** This is close, but the *impact* is on behavior, not just the interpretation itself. The interpretation *leads to* the behavioral change.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""feral"" children, when fully grown, exhibit behaviors like ""fear of humans"" or indifference towards them. This fear stems from their lack of socialization and upbringing within a human community.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ራስን ችሎ መኖር (Self-sufficiency):** While a feral child might *develop* self-sufficiency to survive, it's a *result* of their isolation, not a cause or defining characteristic.
* **B: ጠንካራ የንግግር ችሎታ (Strong language skills):** Feral children are specifically noted to *lack* the ability to learn language due to their isolation.
* **C: ለብቻ የመሆን ዝንባሌዎች (Tendency to be alone):** This is a consequence of their upbringing, but the root issue is the *fear* and lack of understanding of social interaction, not simply a preference for solitude.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states** that ""ፌራል"" or feral children haven't learned to live with caregivers. This lack of social interaction is the core of their condition.  The text indicates this can stem from abandonment, abuse, or being raised by animals, all of which represent a disconnect from human society.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: አብዛኛው የስድነት ባህሪ የሚከሰተው በአካላዊ ጉድለት ነው** - The passage mentions physical disabilities as *a reason* for abandonment in *some* cases, but doesn’t say it's the most common cause, or that it *causes* the feral behavior.
* **C: ስድ ባህሪ በወላጆቻቸው ተዘግቶባቸው የኖሩ ልጆች ውስጥ ብቻ ነው የሚበዛው** -  The text mentions children raised by animals, or living alone in the wild, as examples. It's not limited to abandonment by parents.
* **D: ሁሉም ስድ ባህሪ በከባድ የአዕምሯዊ ጉድለቶች የሚከሰቱ ናቸው** - The passage states that parents *may* abandon children due to mental or physical disabilities, but doesn't say all feral children have such impairments.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly defines subsistence farming as focused on producing enough for the farmer and their family's *own* consumption (""to feed himself and his family"").  Producing food *for sale* moves beyond subsistence and into commercial farming.

*   **A: የገበሬውን ቤተሰብ ፍላጎቶች የሚያሟላ ምርት ላይ ማተኮር (Focusing on producing enough to meet the farmer's family needs):** This is the core definition of subsistence farming.
*   **C: ከተራቀቁ ቴክኒኮች በተቃራኒ በከፍተኛ ምርት ላይ ማተኮር (Focusing on yield using relatively simple techniques rather than advanced technologies):** The passage states it uses ""relatively simple techniques"" like crop rotation.
*   **D: ዘሮችን ከገበሬው አካባቢ ማግኘት (Obtaining seeds from the local environment):** The passage mentions using ""native, adapted seeds."""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሙሉ በሙሉ ኦርጋኒክ ስርዓት ነው** (It is a completely organic system) - The passage states it's *often* organic, but not always. It's a characteristic, not a defining feature.
*   **B: ሰብሎችን ለመጨመር ልዩ ዘዴዎችን ይጠቀማል** (It uses special methods to increase crops) - It mentions simple techniques like crop rotation, but doesn't emphasize ""special"" methods. It's about simplicity.
*   **C: የግብርና ባለሙያዎች በየክልላቸው ሰብላቸውን እንዲያጋሩ ያስችላቸዋል** (Agricultural experts allow them to share their crops in their regions) - This is not mentioned in the passage at all.

ቤተ መዘክርን መጎብኘት በየትኛው የቱሪዝም ምድብ ስር ይወድቃል?,"The correct answer is **C: ባህላዊ ቱሪዝም**.

Here's why:

The passage states that **""If a person's purpose of visiting a place is to thoroughly know the history and culture of the place, this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.""** Visiting a museum (ቤተ መዘክር) is directly related to learning about the history and culture of a place.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የንግድ ቱሪዝም (Business tourism)** - This involves travel for work-related purposes.
*   **B: የመዝናኛ ቱሪዝም (Recreational tourism)** - This focuses on relaxation and enjoyment, like beaches and theme parks.
*   **D: ከቤት ውጭ ቱሪዝም (Outdoor tourism)** - This focuses on activities in nature.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that recreational tourists travel to places ""to relax and enjoy themselves, far from their normal daily routines."" Option B directly reflects this idea of taking a break from everyday life.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በአካባቢው ባህል ራሳቸውን መመሰጥ** - This is more characteristic of cultural tourism, not recreational tourism.
*   **C: አስፈላጊ የቦታ ምልክቶችን ማየት** - While recreational tourists *might* see landmarks, it's not their primary goal.
*   **D: የአንድ ቦታን ታሪክ መረዳት** - This is the main purpose of cultural tourism.

በአካባቢው ቤተ ክርስቲያን ውስጥ የለውጥ ፍርሃት እንዲቀንስ የረዳው በምንባቡ ውስጥ ምን ተጠቅሷል?,"The correct answer is **A: የስራ ፈጠራ ባህሪን ስኬታማ አጋጣሚዎችን ማስታወስ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""እንደነዚህ ያሉት የስኬት ታሪኮች፣ ለለውጥ የነበረውን ፍርሃትን በመቀነስ፣ ወደፊቱ ለሚኖረው ለውጥ አዎንታዊ አመለካከቶችን ፈጥሯል።""  This refers to remembering past successful innovations and opportunities (""ስራ ፈጠራ ባህሪን ስኬታማ አጋጣሚዎችን"") as the factor that reduced fear of change.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: በድርጅቱ ባህል ላይ ተጽእኖ ስላደረጉ ሰዎች ግንዛቤ ማግኘት** - While important for understanding the organization, the text doesn't directly link this to reducing fear of change.
*   **C: የድርጅቱን ነጂ ኃይሎች ማግኘት** - Understanding driving forces is helpful, but not the specific thing mentioned as lessening fear.
*   **D: የድርጅቱን ታሪክ መረዳት** - Knowing the history is a foundation, but it’s the *successful* parts of that history that directly address fear of the new.

The passage explicitly states: ""እንደነዚህ ያሉት የስኬት ታሪኮች፣ ለለውጥ የነበረውን ፍርሃትን በመቀነስ፣ ወደፊቱ ለሚኖረው ለውጥ አዎንታዊ አመለካከቶችን ፈጥሯል።"" (Such success stories, by reducing the fear of change, create positive attitudes towards future change.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: እሴቶችን ለማጠንከር** - While understanding history *can* reinforce values, the passage doesn’t focus primarily on this.
*   **C: ከድርጅቱ ውስጥ ቦታ እንዳለን ስሜት መሰማት** - The passage mentions feeling connected to the organization's history (""people know where they fit in the organization's story""), but it's not the main benefit highlighted.
*   **D: የስራ ፈጠራ ባህሪን ማሻሻል** - The passage mentions remembering past innovation, but the main outcome is reducing fear of change, not directly improving innovative behavior.

ከሚከተሉት መግለጫዎች ውስጥ የድህረ ዘመናዊውን የመማር አካሄዶች በትክክል የሚገልጸው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: በመማር ውስጥ ምንም ፍጹም ነገር የለም**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""There is no one good way to learn."" and ""There is no one good thing about learning."" This directly translates to the idea that there is nothing perfect or universally effective in learning.
* **Postmodern approach emphasized:** The passage highlights the postmodern approach's rejection of single, rigid methods. It emphasizes that learning is a unique experience between the learner and the knowledge.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: አንዳንድ የመማር ልምዶች ከሌሎቹ በበለጠ ጠቃሚ ናቸው (Some learning experiences are more valuable than others):** This contradicts the passage's central argument against a single ""good"" way to learn.
* **B: መማር ሊያጋጥሙን ይችላሉ ብለን በምናምናቸው ነገሮች ላይ ማተኮር አለበት (Learning should focus on things we believe we can encounter):** The passage doesn't discuss beliefs about encountering things. It focuses on the disconnect between passive observation (like TV) and active application of knowledge.
* **C: አንዳንድ የመማሪያ ዘዴዎች ከሌሎቹ የተሻሉ ናቸው (Some teaching methods are better than others):** This also contradicts the postmodern stance against hierarchical ""better"" methods.  The passage doesn't advocate for *better* methods, but for recognizing the subjective nature of learning.



"
ከሚከተሉት መግለጫዎች ውስጥ የድህረ ዘመናዊነት የመማሪያ አካሄድን በትክክል የማይገልጸው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: አንዳን የመማር ተሞክሮዎች ከሌሎቹ ቅድሚያ ሊሰጣቸው ይገባል**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states that there's no single ""good"" way to learn.** Postmodern approaches reject the idea of a hierarchy or ranking of learning methods. Everything is relative to the learner and the knowledge.
*   Options A, C, and D all align with the passage's ideas:
    *   **A** reflects the idea that there's no one right way.
    *   **C** directly echoes the passage's claim that learning is an experience *between* student and knowledge.
    *   **D** is illustrated by the examples of TV programs showing things we'll never practically do – acknowledging that learning isn't always about immediate application.

Therefore, option B is the only statement that contradicts the core tenets of the postmodern approach to learning as described in the passage."
በተለመደው የእንቅልፍ ጊዜ ውስጥ ሆን ተብሎ ከተነቃ በኋላ ከእነዚህ ውስጥ የትኛው በእንቅልፍ መቋረጥ ሂደት ውስጥ ጣልቃ ይገባል?,"The correct answer is **B: መጸዳጃ ቤትን መጠቀም እና ቀጥታ ወደ መኝታ መሄድ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states** that drinking fluids before bed (specifically mentioning water or tea, which are diuretics) can lead to waking up to urinate, thus interrupting sleep. Option B directly describes this scenario.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ወደ እንቅልፍ ከመሄዳችን በፊት ለአንድ ሰዓት ከግማሽ ያህል ማንበብ:**  Reading before bed isn't mentioned as a disruptor. It could even *promote* sleepiness.
* **C: በጠረጺዛው ላይ ማንቂያውን መዝጋት እና ከሀያ ደቂቃ በኋላ ተመልሶ መተኛት:** This describes a form of sleep interruption *caused* by the alarm, but isn’t an intentional method described in the passage for initiating a sleep interruption. The passage describes using a gentle alarm to *facilitate* a sleep interruption.
* **D: ጠረጴዛዎ ላይ ካለ ብርጭቆ ውሃ ለመጠጣት መነሳት:** While drinking water can *lead* to interruption (as stated in the passage), this option describes simply getting a drink of water. It doesn't specifically link it to needing to urinate, which is the key mechanism described for intentional interruption.

Here's why:

*   The passage states sleep interruption involves waking up and falling *back* to sleep after a short period (10-60 minutes), not within a two-hour timeframe.

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct based on the passage:

*   **A: በባዮሪትም ላይ የተመሠረተ ሊሆን ይችላል (It can be based on a biorhythm):** The passage mentions ""other biorhythm-based options"" like drinking fluids before bed.
*   **B: ግቡ እራስዎን ሙሉ በሙሉ አለማንቃት ነው (The goal is not to fully wake yourself up):** The passage says it can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm to bring you to consciousness *without* fully waking you.
*   **C: ሂደቱ በተለመደው የእንቅልፍ ጊዜዎ ውስጥ ይካሄዳል (The process happens during your normal sleep time):**  The first sentence defines sleep interruption as occurring within your regular sleep period.

አንጎል ብዙ ጊዜ ግልጽ ህልምን ለማየት ሲሞክር ምን ይጨምራል?,"The correct answer is **D: በ REM ሁኔታዎች መካከል ያለው ጊዜ**.

Here's why:

The passage states the difficulty arises from ""**expanding the time length between REM periods**"" which leads to frequent, vivid dreams. This is described as being similar to waking up every 20-30 minutes to watch TV – the increased time *between* REM cycles is the core issue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: የ REM ሁኔታዎች ብዛት (The number of REM periods):** The passage doesn’t say there are *more* REM periods, just that the time *between* them is longer.
* **B: የኃይል ደረጃዎች (Energy levels):** Energy levels are not mentioned as a factor.
* **C: የማገገም ሁኔታ ርዝመት (Length of recovery periods):** While recovery is mentioned, the problem isn’t the length of recovery *within* REM, but the lengthening of the time *between* REM cycles.

Here's why:

The passage states the issue stems from *extending* the length of time in REM sleep. More REM sleep means more vivid dreaming, and the analogy to waking up every 20-30 minutes to watch TV illustrates how exhausting this can be.  The passage directly links frequent, intense dreaming (caused by increased REM) to the fatigue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በREM ሁኔታዎች መካከል ያለው የጊዜ ርዝመት መቀነስ (Decreasing the length of time between REM cycles):** The passage says the *extension* of REM cycles is the problem, not shortening the time between them.
*   **B: የ REMs መቀነስ በየምሽት (Decreasing REMs per night):**  The passage implies the opposite – too *many* REM cycles are the issue.
*   **C: ግልጽ በሆነ ህልም ላይ ጥገኛ (Dependence on lucid dreaming):** While someone might *experience* lucid dreams frequently, the passage focuses on the physiological effect of prolonged REM, not addiction to the experience itself.

በምንባቡ መሰረት የተለመዱ ቡድኖች እና ምናባዊ ቡድኖች የሚመሳሰሉት እንዴት ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ሁለቱም በተመሳሳይ ደረጃ እንደሰሩ ይጠበቃል** (Both are expected to perform at the same high standards).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ቨርቹዋል ቡድኖች ከተለመዱት ቡድኖች ተመሳሳይ የላቁ ደረጃዎች ጋር የተያዙ ናቸው"" (Virtual teams are associated with the same high standards as traditional teams).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage indicates virtual teams *tend* to be more self-managed, suggesting a difference in autonomy, not similarity.
*   **C:** Only virtual teams have a ""shadow group"" - a hidden administrative structure. Traditional teams don’t necessarily have this.
*   **D:** The passage states virtual teams often meet on *different* schedules, which is the opposite of being in the same time zone.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that virtual team members are *more* self-managed than traditional team members, and that this self-management can make it difficult for local managers to understand their schedules. This directly contradicts option C, which states traditional teams have *less* autonomy.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: የተለመዱ ቡድኖች ብዙውን ጊዜ ከፍተኛ ደረጃ እንደሆኑ ይቆጠራሉ** - The passage implies traditional teams are considered the core or ""close physical team,"" and virtual teams relate *to* them.
*   **B: ቨርቹዋል ቡድኖች ብዙውን ጊዜ ለተለመዱ ቡድኖች የመገናኛ ነጥብ ሆነው ያገለግላሉ** - The passage explicitly states virtual team members act as a point of contact for their close physical team.
*   **D: የጊዜ ቀጠናዎችን መቀየር ቨርቹዋል ቡድኖችን ሊጠቅም ይችላል** - The passage mentions virtual teams meet on different schedules, which implicitly means they accommodate different time zones because of their self-management and dispersed nature.

Here's why:

* **Content theories** focus on *what* motivates people – the internal needs and drives. The passage specifically states content theories deal with ""certain needs and/or desires people have within them as they grow into adulthood"" and ""what makes certain people want to do things.""

Let's look at why the other options *are* related to content theories:

* **B: የአንድ ሰው ካባቢ በተግባሮቻቸው ላይ እንዴት ተጽዕኖ እንደሚያመጣ** - Content theories often explore how the environment can satisfy (or not satisfy) those internal needs, influencing behavior.
* **C: ውስጥን ያማከሉ ፍላጎቶች** - This is a direct restatement of what content theories investigate.
* **D: ሰዎች የሚወዷቸውን መረዳት** - Understanding what people value is key to understanding their needs and motivations.

However, ""new desires that come with adolescence"" is a *developmental* aspect, not a core focus of content theories themselves. While content theories might be *applied* to understand adolescent motivations, the emergence of those desires during adolescence isn't the central concept of the theories.  Maslow's and Herzberg's theories explain *why* people are motivated, not *when* new motivations arise."

Here's why:

* **The Rule of Thirds** is a compositional guideline that suggests placing key elements along lines that divide an image into thirds, both horizontally and vertically, or at the intersections of those lines. It's about *where* you place things for balance and visual interest.

Let's look at why the other options *are* related to the Rule of Thirds:

* **A: ጉዳዩ የሚቀመጥበት መነሻ መስመር መፍጠር** -  This directly relates to the lines that divide the image into thirds.
* **C: ጉዳዩን በተወሰነ እና ውጤታማ በሆነ ቦታ ላይ ማቆየት** - The rule of thirds helps you place the subject in a visually effective spot (the intersections or along the lines).
* **D: በፎቶ ውስጥ ቅደም ተከተል ማቋቋም** - By placing elements strategically, the rule of thirds can guide the viewer's eye and create a sense of order.

**""ህይወት እና ጉልበት መፍጠር"" (Creating life and vitality)** is a broader artistic goal, not a specific element of the Rule of Thirds itself. While a well-composed image using the rule of thirds *can* contribute to a feeling of life and vitality, it's not a defining part of the rule.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that many common formats (like APS) are *equal to or very close* to the 3:2 aspect ratio of 35mm. This directly contradicts option C.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: ገና በመመረት ላይ ይገኛል** - The passage says 35mm was dominant at the *end of the analog film era*, implying it's still in use, though declining.
* **B: በዲጂታል ካሜራ ቅርጸቶች ተቀባይነት አግኝቷል** - The passage states its dominance has been *eroded* by digital sensor formats, meaning digital cameras still use it, just not as overwhelmingly.
* **D: በዓለም ላይ ይበልጥ የተለመደው ቅርጸት ነው** - The passage begins by stating 35mm is still the most common image format worldwide.

Here's why:

The passage states that improvements in lens manufacturing have allowed zoom lenses to achieve image quality *comparable* to lenses with fixed focal lengths. This directly addresses how zoom lenses have improved due to better manufacturing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ከፍ ያለ የሌንስ ፍጥነት አላቸው** - The passage explicitly states zoom lenses *typically* have *lower* maximum apertures (slower speeds).
* **B: በዝቅተኛ ብርሃን ሁኔታዎች ውስጥ ለመጠቀም ቀላል ናቸው** - Again, the passage says they are *difficult* to use in low light due to the slower apertures.
* **D: ከዋና ሌንሶች ያነሰ የትኩረት ውስብስብነት አላቸው** - The passage states zoom lenses have *more* complexity and a greater number of lens elements.

Here's why:

The passage states that a *disadvantage* of magnifying lenses is they usually have a *lower* maximum aperture (speed). This means they are *not* good in low-light situations. Therefore, magnifying lenses should be chosen *over* prime lenses only if a large maximum aperture is the priority - implying prime lenses don't offer that benefit in this case.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ያነሰ የሌንስ ነገሮችን ከፈለጉ** - The passage explicitly states magnifying lenses have *more* lens elements than prime lenses.
*   **C: በጨለማ ቅንብሮች ውስጥ ብልጭታ መጠቀም ካልፈለጉ** - Magnifying lenses are *bad* in low light.
*   **D: ተጨማሪ የትኩረት ውስብስብነት እየፈለጉ ከሆነ** - The passage states that the complexity of focusing is a *disadvantage* of magnifying lenses.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that mysticism (መንፈሳዊነት) *distinguishes itself* from other religious beliefs and practices by its *unique* focus on direct personal experience of altered states of consciousness.  Option D says this focus is *comparable* to other religions, which contradicts the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

*   **A:** The passage describes mystical experiences as often peaceful, insightful, joyful, and even ecstatic.
*   **B:** The passage states that adherents seek direct experience, insight, or realization of the divine reality/God.
*   **C:** The passage mentions that followers often pursue specific practices or ways of life to cultivate these experiences.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes **direct, personal experience** of the divine, a unique state of consciousness. It highlights individual connection, insight, and realization.  ""Communal or shared experiences"" aren't the primary focus; instead, the text stresses *individual* attainment of understanding and a personal, often blissful, state of consciousness.

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with the passage:

*   **A: ወደ መለኮታዊ እውነታ ግንዛቤን መፈለግ (Seeking insight into divine reality):**  The passage directly states spirituality involves seeking understanding of the divine.
*   **C: ለንቃተ ህሊና ደስተኛ ሁኔታ አጽንዖት መስጠት (Emphasizing a blissful state of consciousness):** The passage explicitly mentions peaceful, insightful, joyful, and even ecstatic qualities associated with mystical experience.
*   **D: ስለ ፈጣሪ የንቃተ ህሊና ግንዛቤ እንዲኖር መፈለግ (Seeking conscious awareness of the creator):** This aligns with the idea of seeking knowledge of God or the ultimate reality.

Here's why:

The passage states that the original belief was that Māori people migrated from Polynesia and established an agricultural society in New Zealand, displacing the Moriori. While the passage *then* goes on to describe how that original understanding was revised regarding the Moriori's origins, the question asks who *originally* was thought to have started the agricultural society. The text explicitly states it was believed to be the Māori from Polynesia.

The passage states Pureland origami was *designed to help inexperienced folders or those with limited motor skills*.  Someone who has only tried origami a time or two would likely fall into one of those categories.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: አቃፊው በአንድ ጊዜ ብዙ እጥፎችን መስራት ይመርጣል** - Pureland origami specifically restricts you to one fold at a time.
*   **B: አቃፊው የተራቀቁ የሞተር ችሎታዎች አሉት** - Pureland origami is for those *with* limited motor skills, not advanced ones.
*   **C: አቃፊው የኋልዮሽ እጥፋቶችን የሚፈልግ ኦሪጋሚን እየፈጠረ ነው** - Pureland origami specifically *doesn't* allow reverse folds.

The passage explicitly states that all folds in Pureland Origami *must* be straight.  Option C suggests folds can be curved (""አካባቢዎች ሊኖራቸው ይገባል""), which contradicts the definition.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: ልምድ ላላቸው አቃፊዎች የታሰበ ነው** - The passage states it was *designed to help those with limited experience* (or motor skills), meaning it's *not* for experienced folders. This is a true statement about what Pureland Origami *isn't*.
*   **B: ዘዴው የኋልዮች እጥፋቶችን አያካትትም** - The passage states complex folds like reverse folds aren't allowed, so this is accurate.
*   **D: ውስን የሞተር ክህሎቶች ላላቸው አቃፊዎች ጥሩ ዘዴ ነው** - The passage directly states it was created to help people with limited motor skills.

*   **A: ሀራፓ** - The passage mentions ""Harappan Civilization"" as an alternative name for the Indus Valley Civilization, directly linking it.
*   **B: ስሳራቫቲ ወንዝ** - The passage discusses the Sarasvati River and the argument for naming the civilization ""Indus-Sarasvati"" due to its potential location.
*   **D: አብዛኛው የዘመናችን ፓኪስታን** - The passage explicitly states the civilization covered much of present-day Pakistan.

Therefore, only option C is not directly and definitively linked to the Indus Valley Civilization as described in the passage."

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    *   **የሐራፓ ስልጣኔ (Harappan Civilization)** - as a name used after the 1920s excavations.
    *   **ኢንዱስ-ሳራቫቲ ስልጣኔ (Indus-Sarasvati Civilization)** - as a name suggested by some scholars.
    *   **የኢንዱስ ወንዝ ስልጣኔ (Indus River Civilization)** - as the origin of the name, tied to the river valleys where it flourished.

*   **የኢንዱስ ተራራ ስልጣኔ (Indus Mountain Civilization)** is *not* mentioned in the passage and doesn't align with the geographical focus on the river valleys. Therefore, it's the name that hasn't been introduced as a possibility for this civilization.

በምንባቡ መሰረት እንደ የረጅም ጊዜ ጥቅምን የሚያመጣው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ከሌሎች ጋር መተባበር (Collaborating with others)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""አብዛኛዎቹ ሰዎች የረዥም ጊዜ ምርጡ አማራጫቸው ከሌሎች ጋር በጋራ መስራት መሆኑን እንደሚገነዘቡ ተስፋ ይደረጋል"" (It is hoped that most people will realize that the best long-term option is to work together with others).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: የራስን ጥቅም ማስቀደም (Prioritizing one's own interests)** - The passage acknowledges self-interest can lead to short-term gains, but isn't the *best* long-term strategy.
*   **C: ከብዙሃኑ ይልቅ አናሳዎችን ለሚጠቅመው አጽንዖት መስጠት (Emphasizing what benefits a few over the many)** - The passage doesn't support this idea. It speaks to collective benefit.
*   **D: ስግብግብነት ጠቃሚ እንደሆነ እውቅና መስጠት (Acknowledging greed is beneficial)** - The passage suggests greed and selfishness are often linked, but doesn't claim they are ultimately beneficial.

በምንባቡ መሰረት አንድ ሰው ፈጣን ጥቅም ላይ ካተኮረ ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ ለየትኛው ቅድሚያ ይሰጣል?,"The correct answer is **D: ራስ ወዳድነት (Self-interest)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that acting with self-interest can lead to *short-term* gains, even if collaboration is ultimately better in the long run.  The question specifically asks what someone focused on *immediate* benefit would prioritize. Therefore, self-interest is the most logical answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሌሎችን ማስቀደም (Putting others first):** This is the opposite of self-interest.
*   **B: ትብብር (Collaboration):** While the passage hopes people will choose this eventually, it's presented as a long-term strategy, not a quick win.
*   **C: አብሮ መስራት (Working together):** Similar to collaboration, this is a long-term benefit, not the focus of someone seeking fast rewards.

Here's why:

The passage states ""ከፍተኛዎቹ መካከለኛ ዘመኖች በመጀመሪያዎቹ የመካከለኛው ዘመኖች ይቀደማሉ"". This directly translates to ""The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages.""
"
ከቴምፕላሮች ዘመን በኋላ የትኛው ክፍለ ጊዜ ነው የመጣው?,"The correct answer is **A: የመካከለኛው ዘመን መጨረሻ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ከፍተኛዎቹ መካከለኛ ዘመኖች በመጨረሻዎቹ መካከለኛ ዘመኖች ይከተላሉ...""  This directly indicates that the Late Middle Ages came *after* the High Middle Ages (the period of the Templars). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 12ኛው ክፍለ ዘመን:** This is *within* the High Middle Ages, not after it.
* **C: ከፍተኛዎቹ መካከለኛ ዘመን:** This is the period *of* the Templars, not what followed it.
* **D: 11ኛው ክፍለ ዘመን:** This is before the High Middle Ages.

* **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    * **B:** The use of scopolamine derived from henbane seeds.
    * **C:** The use of ligatures and tourniquets to stop bleeding.
    * **D:** Amputation to save patients from gangrene.

* **The passage does *not* mention** any treatment for psychological trauma like PTSD, or the use of sedatives specifically for mental health conditions. While they knew about sedatives like morphine and scopolamine, the text only references their use as pain relievers or potentially for other physical conditions, not for psychological ones.

Therefore, option A is the only medical practice or process *not* mentioned in the passage."

Here's why:

* **The passage mentions:**
    * **A: የሕክምና ኮርፖሬሽን ምስረታ (The establishment of a medical corps)** - specifically, the first Roman medical corps.
    * **B: የንጉሰ ነገስቱ ዶክተሮችን መመልመል (Emperors began to patronize doctors)** - mentioning Augustus specifically.
    * **D: የኢምፓየሩ ጠበኛ ወታደራዊ ፖሊሲ (The empire's strong military policy)** - stating it aided medical advancements.

* **The passage *does not* mention** the establishment of teaching hospitals. It details advancements in surgery, pharmacology, and basic medical practices, but not the formalized educational structures of hospitals as we understand them today.

የማየት ችሎታ በምን ላይ የተመረኮዘ ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: የእይታ ስርዓት ስሜት ህዋሳት**.

Here's why:

* **P** states directly that vision or the ability to see is ""limited to the sensory organs or eyes possessing an image-forming system.""  These organs *are* the sensory cells (or sensory organs).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: የአንድ ፍጥረት መስፈርቶች (A creature's requirements):** While the text *says* eye structure is determined by need, the *basis* of vision itself is the eye and its sensory cells, not the need.
* **C: ለተወሰኑ የሞገድ-ርዝመቶች ስሱነት (Sensitivity to certain wavelengths):** This is a *characteristic* of vision, not what vision fundamentally *is*.
* **D: የተለያዩ የንቃት ደረጃዎች (Different levels of acuity):**  Again, acuity is a *result* of how the visual system works, not the base of vision itself.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...this complexity is determined by what the animal requires."" (ይህ የውስብስብነት መጠንም የሚወሰነው እንስሳው በሚያስፈልገው መሰረት ነው።)  This directly links the variation in eye structures to the needs of the animal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: የሞገድ ርዝመት ስሱነት (Wavelength sensitivity):** While the passage mentions different structures are tuned to different wavelengths, this is a *result* of the requirements, not the primary determining factor.
* **C: የንቃት ደረጃ (Activity level):** The passage doesn't discuss activity level as a driver of eye structure.
* **D: የፍጥረቱ ውስብስብነት (Creature's complexity):**  Complexity is a *result* of needing specific vision capabilities, it's not the cause.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states Sikhi arose due to caste discrimination** within Hindu culture, not simply a ""schism"" or split. While it stemmed from issues *within* Hindu society, framing it as a mere schism doesn't fully capture the social and political context of its origins as described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

*   **B: ጉሩ ለሲኪዝም ልዩ የሆነ መሠረታዊ ገጽታ ነው** – The passage explicitly states ""Guru is a fundamental aspect of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism, it took on the importance of being the very foundation of Sikh beliefs.""
*   **C: ከሃይማኖቱ መስራች ጉሩ ናናክ በኋላ ዘጠኝ ጉሩዎች ተከተሉ** – The passage clearly states, ""The religion originated with Guru Nanak (1469–1539), followed by nine successive Gurus.""
*   **D: የተወሰኑ የሲኪዝም ባህሎች በሂንዱዝም ውስጥ ስር ነበራቸው** – The passage states Sikhs ""acknowledge that they have a Hindu base and culture,"" showing a foundation in Hindu traditions.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""‘ጉሩ የሁሉም የህንድ ሃይማኖቶች መሠረታዊ ገጽታ ነው፣ ግን በሴኪዝም ውስጥ የሲክ እምነቶች ዋና መሠረት የሆነውን አስፈላጊነት ተወስዷል።"" This directly indicates that the concept of the Guru is central and fundamental to the Sikh faith.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: የሂንዱ ባህል (Hindu culture):** While the passage acknowledges Sikhism arose *within* a Hindu cultural context and Sikhs recognize a Hindu foundation, it emphasizes that Sikhism is a *distinct* religion.
*   **C: ለሌሎች የህንድ ሀይማኖቶች እውቅና ለመስጠት ፈቃደኛ አለመሆን (Refusal to acknowledge other Indian religions):** The text does not state anything about refusing to acknowledge other religions.
*   **D: ፑንጃቢ ቋንቋን መናገር (Speaking Punjabi):** The passage identifies the origin of Sikhism in the Punjab region but doesn't state that speaking Punjabi is a core tenet of the faith.

The passage specifically states: ""ኤዲዲ ያለባቸው ህፃናት እንደ የትምህርት ስራ ያሉ ነገሮች ላይ ማተኮር ይቸገራሉ"". While they *can* focus on things they enjoy (like games or cartoons), they struggle with academic tasks.

*   The passage explicitly states that scaffolding is *not* a teaching method itself, but a support system. Project-based learning is a teaching method.
*   The passage directly supports options A, B, and D. It explains that scaffolding can be virtual (A), is a support rather than a method (B), and is used when starting new learning processes (D).

Therefore, associating scaffolding with project-based learning as a method of teaching is incorrect according to the provided text."

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that MySpace pages are easily accessible by simply providing a web address, which makes it easy to remember and type, even for students who struggle with spelling or typing. This directly addresses the needs of students with reading difficulties.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ማበጀት (Customization)** - While customization is mentioned, it's related to making the page *easier to read*, not directly helping with spelling or typing difficulties.
*   **B: ብሎጎች (Blogs)** - Blogs aren't specifically mentioned as being helpful for reading difficulties.
*   **D: 54 ሚልዮን መገለጫዎች (54 million profiles)** - The number of profiles is just a statistic about the website's popularity, it doesn't help with reading difficulties.

Here's why:

The passage states the strikes were *against* wage cuts (የደመወዝ ቅነሳን በመቃወም).  Khrushchev's response included concessions to economic demands (A & D) and suppression of the revolt with tanks (B). Increasing wage cuts would be counter to addressing the protesters' concerns and therefore not part of his response.

Here's why:

The passage states that the protests were *against* food shortages and wage cuts, and were a broader challenge to communism.  Khrushchev *responded* to the protests by agreeing to appoint Władysław Gomułka as the new prime minister.  Gomułka's appointment was a *result* of the unrest, not a cause of it.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: ኮሙዩኒዝም** - The passage explicitly states the events were a ""challenge to communism overall.""
*   **B: የምግብ እጥረት** - The passage lists food shortages as one of the things the protestors were against.
*   **C: የደሞዝ ቅነሳ** - The passage also lists wage cuts as something the protestors opposed.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Germany *created* a common enemy by fostering collaboration between the USSR and the USA. Once Germany was defeated, that common ground disappeared. However, the passage doesn't say that differing views *about* Germany caused the rift; it says the *existence* of Germany as a common enemy initially brought them together.

The passage *does* mention that disagreements regarding systems (political ideologies), procedures, and cultural clashes led to the Cold War. These are represented by options A, C, and D.

Therefore, the only option not directly mentioned as a factor influencing the US-Soviet relationship is their opinions of Germany."

Here's why:

* **The passage states the nervous system *ensures* blood circulation continues *without disruption*.**  Slowing down blood flow would be a disruption, and therefore contradicts the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are correct and align with the passage:

* **B: የደም ፍሰትን ማስተዳደር (To manage blood flow)** - The nervous system regulates many bodily functions, including circulation, to maintain optimal performance.
* **C: ሆሞስታሲስን ማቆየት (To maintain homeostasis)** -  Homeostasis is maintaining a stable internal environment. The nervous system's regulation of blood flow is a key component of homeostasis.
* **D: ሊሆኑ የሚችሉ የአካል ስጋቶችን ማስወገድ (To remove potential physical harms)** - The passage specifically says the rapid nerve signals protect the body from potential danger.

በጊዛ አምባ ላይ ምን ሊገኝ ይችላል?,"The correct answer is **D: ታላቁ ፒራሚድ**.

Here's why:

* The text specifically states that the Great Pyramid is located at Giza.
* While the text mentions tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx are *also* at Giza, it emphasizes the Great Pyramid as the primary structure discussed.
* The text explicitly states the Great Pyramid is the *only* one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing, making it the most significant item at Giza.
* Option C is incorrect because only one of the Seven Wonders (the Great Pyramid) is at Giza."
የታላቁ ፒራሚድ አላማ ምን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **B: ለፊርዖን ክብር ለመስጠት (to honor the pharaoh)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""ታላቁ ፒራሚድ የተሠራ ፈርዖን ክሁፉን ለማክበር ነበር"" (The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the pyramid *is* one of the seven wonders, that wasn't its original *purpose* for being built.
*   **C:** The passage doesn't mention the pyramid being built as a landmark.
*   **D:** While it did contain a burial chamber, the primary purpose was honoring the pharaoh, not simply holding bodies."

Here's why:

The passage states that the Ephesians decreed that the name of Herostratus (the arsonist) should *not* be remembered. However, the Greek historian Strabo later recorded his name, and that's how we know it today. Therefore, Strabo is the one who made sure we know about the arsonist and the fire.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኢፋስያኖች** - They tried to erase his name from history.
*   **B: ታላቁ አሌክሳንደር** - He offered to rebuild the temple, but wasn't responsible for revealing the arsonist's name.
*   **D: አርተሚስ** - She is the goddess the temple was dedicated to, not the cause of the fire or its revelation.

Here's why:

* The passage states Alexander *offered* to pay for the rebuilding, but his offer was *declined*.
* It then explicitly says the temple was rebuilt *after* Alexander's death in 323 BCE.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Incorrect - Alexander's offer was refused.
* **C:** Incorrect - Herostratus was the one who *destroyed* the temple, not rebuild it, and wasn't tasked with paying for rebuilding.
* **D:** Incorrect - The passage states it was rebuilt in 323 BCE, not 320 BCE.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""people began walking upright coinciding with the emergence of *Homo erectus* (upright man) around two million years ago."" This directly links *Homo erectus* to the beginning of upright walking.
* While other species show *evidence* of bipedalism (walking on two legs), *Homo erectus* is the first species specifically mentioned as *beginning* to walk upright.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ሳሄላንትሮፖስ:** The passage says it *might* have walked on two legs seven million years ago, but doesn't state it did so extensively.
* **C: የባለ ሁለት እግር መሻሻሎች:** These are just skeletal features, not a species.
* **D: አውስትራሎፒተከስ:** The passage specifically states they *didn't* habitually walk upright. They had some bipedal adaptations, but didn't regularly walk on two legs.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the German Navy, using U-boats, was trying to **stop the traffic** (of people and goods) aimed at helping Britain.  This means their goal was to prevent Britain from receiving support. Option B captures this perfectly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ወደ ብሪታኒያ የሚመጡ ዕቃዎችን ማቋረጥ** - While true, it's not the *goal* itself, but a method of achieving the goal.
* **C: እቃዎችን በአትላንቲክ ላይ ማጓጓዝ** - This is what the Allies were doing, not the German Navy.
* **D: አሜሪካ ሰዎችን እና እቃዎችን እንዳትቀበል መከልከል** - The passage focuses on disrupting aid *to Britain*, not preventing America from sending it.

በምንባቡ ውስጥ በተሰጠው መረጃ መሰረት በሰሜን አትላንቲክ ዘመቻ ወቅት በባህር ኃይል ጦርነት የበለጠ ስኬታማ የነበረው ማን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **B: ጀርመኖች**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the German navy (using U-boats) was *trying to stop* the movement of people and supplies by the Americans and British. While the passage doesn't explicitly say who ""won"", the implication is that the Germans were effectively disrupting Allied shipping. The passage highlights that if the Allies had failed to move supplies, Germany could have potentially conquered more of Europe, including Britain. This demonstrates a level of success for the German naval efforts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ብሪታኒያ እና አሜሪካኖች:** The passage says they were *attempting* to move supplies, but were being actively hindered by the Germans.
*   **C: ጀርመኖች እና ብሪታኒያ:** The passage frames it as the Germans opposing the efforts of the British and Americans.
*   **D: እንግሊዛውያን:** While Britain was involved, the passage discusses the efforts of both America and Britain together, and it doesn't focus solely on the British.



"
አሲሪያኖች ፈረሶችን መጠቀም ሲጀምሩ ያልነበረው ምን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **A: ኮርቻዎች**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""The stirrup had not yet been invented, so Assyrian cavalry fought bareback."" This directly tells us that stirrups didn't exist when the Assyrians began using cavalry.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ደጋኖች:** The passage mentions ""killer spikes"" extending from their chariots, meaning they had them.
*   **C: ሰረገላዎች:** The passage begins by discussing the advantages of Assyrian chariots.
*   **D: የጦር ትጥቅ:** The passage implies warriors had armor (""their armor could penetrate enemy soldiers' armor"").



"
ፈረሰኞችን የተጠቀሙባቸው ጦርነቶች እንዴት ነበር የሚደረጉት?,"The correct answer is **C: በፈረስ ጀርባ**.

The passage explicitly states: ""አሦራውያን ፈረሰኞች በባዶ ፈረሶቻቸው ጀርባ ላይ ተዋጉ"" which translates to ""Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare backs of their horses."" This directly answers the question of how the cavalry fights were conducted.
"
በምንባቡ መሰረት መደበኛ የባቢሎኒያን ዜጋን የማያገኙበት የት ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: ወደ ውስጠኛው መቅደስ መስዋዕቶችን ሲያመጣ**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""ካህናቱ ብቻ መግባት የሚችሉበት የውስጥ መቅደስ ነበረው"" (only priests could enter the inner sanctuary). This means a regular Babylonian citizen would **not** be found bringing sacrifices to the inner sanctuary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ወደ ቤተ መቅደሱ አደባባይ መስዋዕቶችን ሲያመጣ** - The passage states people brought sacrifices to the temple, implying they could access the outer courtyard.
*   **B: በዋናው ቤተ መቅደስ ድግስ ሲታደም** - The passage mentions festivals and celebrations, suggesting citizens would participate in those.
*   **C: በቤተ መቅደሱ አደባባይ በዓል ሲከበር** - Similar to B, citizens would likely be present for festivals in the outer courtyard.



"
ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ በግልጽ ለቄሶች የታሰበው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: የውስጥ መቅደሶች (Inner sanctuaries)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""ካህናቱ ብቻ መግባት የሚችሉበት የውስጥ መቅደስ ነበረው"" (only priests could enter the inner sanctuary). This directly links the inner sanctuaries to the priests.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በዓሎች (Festivals)**: The passage mentions priests *using* festivals to understand the gods' will, but the festivals themselves weren't exclusively for priests.
*   **C: ድግሶች (Sacrifices)**: People offered sacrifices, not just priests.
*   **D: ዚግራትስ (Ziggurats)**: Ziggurats were structures *associated* with the temples, but not exclusively used by priests; they held the special shrine for the god at the top.



"
ንጉስ ቱታንክማን ታዋቂነትን ያገኘው መቼ ነበር?,"The correct answer is **C: መቃብሩ ከተገኘ በኋላ (after his tomb was discovered)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ሆኖም የመቃብሩ መቃብር በ 1922 መገኘቱ ታዋቂ ሰው አደረገው።"" (However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a famous figure.) 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: መቃብሩ ከተሰረቀ በኋላ (after his tomb was robbed)** - The passage states his tomb was *not* robbed, which is why the artifacts were so well-preserved.
*   **B: በሚገዛበት ጊዜ (during his reign)** - The passage says he wasn't considered very important during his time.
*   **D: በጥንት ንጉስ ዝርዝር ውስጥ ከተጠቀሰ በኋላ (after being mentioned in ancient king lists)** - The passage states he was *not* included in most ancient king lists.



"
ንጉስ ቱታንክማን በጣም ታዋቂ የግብጽ ንጉስ ያደረገው ምን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **A: ያልተነካው መቃብሩ መገኘት**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""ሆኖም የመቃብሩ መቃብር በ 1922 መገኘቱ ታዋቂ ሰው አደረገው። ያለፉት ብዙ የመቃብር ስፍራዎች ሲዘርፉ ይህ መቃብር በጭራሽ አልተረበሸም ነበር."" (However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous. Unlike many past burial sites that were raided, this tomb was never plundered.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: በጥንት ንጉስ ዝርዝሮች ውስጥ የነበረው ደረጃ** - The passage says he *wasn't* considered important and wasn't listed in most ancient king lists.
* **C: ከመቃብሩ በሺዎች የሚቆጠሩ ቅርሶች መዘረፋቸው** - The passage states the tomb was *never* plundered, meaning the artifacts weren't stolen.
* **D: በጥንት የግጻውያን ጊዜ በነበረው ጠቀሜታ** - The passage says he wasn't considered important in ancient times.



"
ታላቁ ገጣሚ ሆመር ማድረግ ያልቻለው ምን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **A: መስማት (Hearing)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Homer composed the *Iliad* and *Odyssey*. Tradition holds that Homer was blind. While not explicitly stated in the passage, it's a widely known fact associated with the figure of Homer. Therefore, he would not have been able to hear.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ማየት (Seeing)** - This is likely true that he couldn't see, but the passage doesn't *directly* state it.
*   **C: መራመድ (Walking)** - There's no information to suggest he couldn't walk.
*   **D: መናገር (Speaking)** - As a poet and storyteller, he *certainly* could speak!"
የትኛው ታዋቂ ግሪክ ነበር ከስነ ጽሑፍ ውጪ በሌላ ነገር የሚታወቀው?,"The correct answer is **C: ፓይታጎረስ**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Pythagoras was a famous Greek mathematician, known for the Pythagorean theorem. This clearly identifies him as being famous for something *other* than literature.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ሶፎሲስ** - The passage identifies Sophocles as a playwright (a literary figure).
* **B: ሆመር** - The passage explicitly states Homer was a poet (a literary figure), famous for the *Iliad* and *Odyssey*.
* **D: አሪስቶፌንስ** - The passage identifies Aristophanes as a playwright (a literary figure).



"
የእብራይስጥ ቤተሰብ አብዛኛውን ጊዜያቸውን ያሳለፉት የት ነበር?,"The correct answer is **A: ከቤት ውጭ (Outside)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""አብዛኛው የዕብራውያን ቤተሰብ ሕይወት የሚመራው ከቤት ውጪ ላይ ነበር።"" (Most of the Hebrew family life was conducted outside.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: በጎዳና ላይ (On the street)** - While shops faced the street, the passage doesn't say family life centered *on* the street.
*   **C: ግቢ ውስጥ (In the courtyard)** - The passage mentions women cooking in the courtyard, but not that *all* family life took place there. It was part of being ""outside.""
*   **D: በቤት ውስጥ (Inside)** - The passage directly contradicts this, stating life was conducted *outside*.



"
ለእብራይስጥ ቤተሰብ በጣም አስፈላጊ ያልነበረው ምን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **C: ቤታቸው (their home)**.

The passage explicitly states ""ቤቱ ብዙም አስፈላጊ አልነበረም"" (the house wasn't very important). The text goes on to explain *why* it wasn't important - the climate and lifestyle meant life happened outside.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: የአየር ጸባያቸው (their climate)** - The climate is *why* the house was less important, not what was unimportant itself.
* **B: ታሪካቸው (their history)** - The passage doesn't discuss their history.
* **D: ምግብ አበሳሰላቸው (their food preparation)** - Food preparation happened *outside* the house, but it was still an important activity.  The passage doesn’t state that food preparation was unimportant.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states differences in:**
    *   **ታሪኩ (History)** - ""ነገስታት፣ ልማዶች እና ታሪክ መካከል ብዙ ልዩነቶች ነበሩ""
    *   **ልማዶቹ (Customs)** - ""ነገስታት፣ ልማዶች እና ታሪክ መካከል ብዙ ልዩነቶች ነበሩ""
    *   **ሰዎቹ (People)** - ""በዴንማርክ፣ ስዊድን፣ ኖርዌይ እና አይስላንድ ሰዎች...""

*   **The passage does *not* mention any differences in the land (መሬት) of the Scandinavian countries.** It focuses on cultural and historical distinctions.

Therefore, ""መሬት"" (land) is the difference that isn't highlighted in the text."
በቅድሚያ በግሪንላንድ የሰፈረው ማን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **A: የኢሲኪሞ ጎሳዎች (Eskimo tribes)**.

The text explicitly states: ""ኤስኪሞ ጎሳዎች በወቅቱ እዚያ ይኖሩ ነበር"" (Even though Erik the Red discovered it, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ኖርዌያኖች (Norwegians):** While Erik the Red was from Norway, the text highlights the Eskimo were *already* there.
*   **C: ኤሪክ ቀዩ (Erik the Red):** He discovered/named it, but didn't *first* settle it.
*   **D: ስዊድኖች (Swedes):** The text doesn't mention Swedes being the first settlers.

ያለ መቀመጫ መመገብ የሚመርጠው ቡድን የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ባለሀብት የሮማን ወንድ** (Wealthy Roman man).

Here's why:

The text states, ""ድሆቹ እና ሴቶቹ ወንበሮች ላይ ተቀምጠው ምግብ ሲመገቡ፣ ሀብታሞቹ ምግባቸውን በሚመገቡበት ጊዜ በጎን በኩል አብረው የሚዝናኑበት ትልቅ ድግስ ማድረግ ይወዳሉ።"" This means wealthy men preferred to recline while eating, with those of lower status (and women) seated.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that ancient Romans *did not* have turkey. It mentions they didn't have foods that came to Europe much later, like potatoes, tomatoes, corn, or cocoa, and specifically highlights the absence of turkey.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ደሀ እንግዳዎች በወንበር ላይ መመገብ** - The passage mentions that poorer guests would recline while eating, similar to the wealthy.
*   **B: የምግብ ፍላጎት አምጪ ቀንድ አውጣዎች** - The passage lists dormice and snails as unusual delicacies.
*   **C: በእራት ወቅት ባለሀብት ወንዶች መጋደም** - The passage explains that wealthy Romans enjoyed large feasts where they would recline and be served.

በምንባቡ መሰረት ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ ዘላቂ ተጽእኖ ሊኖረው የሚችልበት እድሉ ያነሰው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: የስልጣኔ ባህል**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that civilization is characterized by ""a lasting cultural legacy and equitable distribution.""  It emphasizes that civilization *is* the transmission of knowledge over generations, leaving a lasting impact.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: ማህበረሰቡ (Society):** While important, the passage defines civilization *as* the culture within a society, not the society itself.
* **B: አናሳ ባህል (Minor cultures):** The passage specifically says these often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and don't achieve recognition *as* civilization.
* **C: የከተማ መስተዳደር (Urban administration):**  The passage mentions urban centers as precursors to nations, but the lasting impact comes from the culture that develops within them, not just the administration.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት ከብሔር ምን ይቀድማል?,"The correct answer is **A: የስልጣኔ ባህል**.

Here's why:

The passage states that civilization is a shared single culture among a large population, and that it involves the transmission of knowledge over generations, a lasting cultural legacy, and fair distribution. It implies that this shared cultural aspect *defines* civilization and precedes its development into more complex structures like city-states and nations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ነጠላ ባህል (Single culture)** - While civilization *is* a single culture, the passage indicates this culture arises *from* people living together and working, and isn't the initial starting point.
*   **C: የከተማ መስተዳደር (Urban administration)** - The passage says city-states are *precursors* to countries, meaning they come *after* the formation of a civilization's culture.
*   **D: አናሳ ባህሎች (Minor cultures)** - These are presented as cultures that *don't* become civilizations, so they don't come before civilization, they are the opposite."
ስለ ድሩክሃል ዞንግ ትክክል ያልሆነው መግለጫ የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: የቲቤቶች ሞንጎል ኃይሎች ድልን ለማክበር የተገነባ ነው** (It was built to celebrate the victory of Tibetan-Mongol forces).

Here's why:

The passage states that the dzong was built by Ngawang Namgyel **to commemorate *his* victory over Tibetan-Mongol forces**, not to celebrate the forces themselves. This makes option A the incorrect statement.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **B: ቡታን ውስጥ ነው የሚገኘው** (It is located in Bhutan) - The passage clearly states it's in the Paro district of Bhutan.
*   **C: አብዛኛውን የምሽግ ቅርስ እሳት አጥፍቶታል** (Most of the dzong's artifacts were destroyed by fire) - The passage says the fire left only a few relics.
*   **D: በዛብድሩንግ ጋዋንግ ናምግዬል ነበር የተፈጠረው** (It was created by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel) - The passage specifically states he built the dzong."

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""በ1951 እሳቱ የድሩክግያል ድዞንግን እንደ ዝሃብድሩንግ ንጋዋንግ ናምግያል ምስል ያሉ አንድአንድ የተቀደሱ የጥንት ዕቃዎች ብቻ እንዲቀሩ አደረገ።"" (In 1951, the fire left only a few sacred relics of Drukgyal Dzong, such as the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage mentions the battle *before* the dzong was built, not as a result of the fire.
* **C:** The passage says the dzong *became* one of Bhutan's most cherished landmarks *after* the fire, implying its fame *increased*.
* **D:** The passage says the *dzong* was preserved, not Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal himself.

ስለ ካምቦዲያ ትክክለ የሆነው መግለጫ የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: ታይላንዶች ፍኖም ፌንን አወደሙ**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ቬትናሞች ፍኖም ፌንን አውድመዋል** - The text says the *Thais* destroyed Phnom Penh, not the Vietnamese.
* **B: ካምቦዲያ ታይላንድን በ 1772 ወረረች** - The text states the opposite – Thailand invaded Cambodia.
* **C: ካምቦዲያ በ 18 ክፍለ ዘመን መጀመሪያ ላይ ቬትናሞችን ወረረች** - The text mentions Vietnamese invasions *of* Cambodia, not Cambodia invading Vietnam.
"
ከሚከተሉት መግለጫዎች ውስጥ የካምቦዲያን ወረራ በትክክል የሚገልጸው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: ታይላንዶች ካምቦዲያን ብዙ ጊዜ ወረዋል**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""በ 18ኛው ክፍለዘመን ታኢስ ብዙ ጊዜ ካምቦዲያን ይወሩ ነበር"" (In the 18th century, the Thais often invaded Cambodia).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ቬትናሞች ካምቦዲያን ለብዙ ጊዜ ወረዋል** - While the passage mentions Vietnamese invasions *toward the end* of the 18th century, it doesn't say they invaded repeatedly like the Thais did.
*   **B: ታይላንዶች እና ቬትናሞች ካምቦዲያን በ 1772 ወረሩ** - The passage states the Thais destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772, but doesn't say the Vietnamese participated in that specific attack.
*   **C: ቬትናሞች ፍኖም ፌንን አውድመዋል** - The passage states the *Thais* destroyed Phnom Penh (Fnnom Penh), not the Vietnamese.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the Dutch East India Company *was replaced* by the Qing dynasty in 1683.** This implies the Qing forces *took* control, not that the Dutch willingly handed it over. The Dutch were ousted by military force.
* The passage *does* mention the Dutch:
    * **A: Establishing a presence in the southwest of the island.** (They founded a base in southern Taiwan)
    * **B: Altering indigenous agricultural practices.** (They changed the farming habits of the natives.)
    * **C: Employing Chinese laborers.** (They hired Chinese workers for sugar and rice factories.)

Therefore, option D is the only action not attributed to the Dutch East India Company during their time in Taiwan."
የሺሞኖሴኪ ስምምነት የመሰረተው ምን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **D: ጃፓን የታይዋን ገዢ መሆን**.

The passage states: ""በ 1895 የመጀመሪያው የቻይና-ጃፓን ጦርነት (1894-1895) ከተሸነፈ በኋላ የቺንግ መንግስት የሺሞኖስኪን ስምምነት በመፈረም በታይዋን ላይ ሉዓላዊነትን ለጃፓን ያስረከበ ሲሆን ደሴቲቱ እስከ 1945 ድረስ ተቆጣጠራለች።"" This directly translates to Japan gaining sovereignty over Taiwan through the Treaty of Shimonoseki.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The treaty was *a result* of Japan's victory, not a cause of it.
*   **B:** The treaty *ended* Taiwan being under Qing rule.
*   **C:** The treaty did not give China control of Taiwan's coastal areas, but rather transferred control *to* Japan.

የአንድ ኬሚካል የፒኤች ደረጃ የሚለካው እንዴት ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: በኬሚካሉ ውስጥ ያሉ የሃይድሮጂን አዮኖች ብዛት**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""የpH መጠን በሃይድሮጂን (H በ pH ውስጥ) አዮኖች መጠን ያመለክታል።"" (The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኬሚካሉ ምን ያህል ቤዚክ ወይም አሲዲክ እንደሆነ** - While pH *indicates* acidity or basicity, it doesn't *measure* it directly. It measures the concentration of hydrogen ions, which *determines* acidity/basicity.
* **B: በኬሚካሉ ውስጥ ባሉ ፕሩቶኖች ብዛት** -  The passage specifically talks about *hydrogen ions*, which are protons, but the pH is about the concentration of these ions, not just the total number of protons in the chemical.
* **D: በኬሚካሉ ውስጥ ባሉ የኤሌክትሮኖች ብዛት** - The passage explains that hydrogen ions *have lost* electrons, meaning electron count isn't the defining factor for pH.



"
ከሃይድሮጂን አዮኖች ምንድን ነው የተወገደው?,"The correct answer is **D: ኤሌክትሮኖች**.

The passage specifically states: ""የሃይድሮጂን አዮኖች ኤሌክትሮኖቻቸው የተወሰደባቸው ፕሮቶኖች ናቸው"".  This directly answers the question.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ፕሮቶኖች** - The passage says hydrogen ions *are* protons, they aren't having protons removed.
*   **B: ፒኤች** - pH is a measurement, not something removed from hydrogen ions.
*   **C: አልካላይን** - Alkalinity is a property, not something removed.

ከሚከተሉት መግለጫዎች ውስጥ የአንበሳዎች መንጋን በትክክል የማይገልጸው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ወንዶቹ እና ሴቶቹ ሁሉም በቅርብ የሚዛመዱ ናቸው**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the *females* are closely related – ""The females are often very closely related, with many sister and daughter relationships."" It doesn't say the males are also closely related to the females within the pride. The males are described as a smaller group of 1-3 unrelated males.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: ከውሻ መንጋዎች ጋር ተመሳሳይ ባህሪ አላቸው** - The passage states ""like dogs..."" indicating a similarity in behavior.
*   **B: የወንድ ለሴት ምጥጥኑ ተመጣጣኝ አይደለም** - The passage states there are ""one to three males"" for ""thirty or more females,"" showing an imbalance.
*   **D: አደገኛም ማህበራዊም ናቸው** - The passage states lions are very social (""highly social cats"") and dangerous (""very dangerous to prey"").

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that lions are *not* like other large predators: ""እንደ አንበሳ ላሉ እንስሳዎች (ግን ሌሎች ትላልቅ ድመቶች አይደሉም)."" This directly contradicts option D.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: በጣም ማህበራዊ ናቸው** - The passage states lions are ""very social animals"" living in prides.
*   **B: ባህሪያቸው ከተኩላዎች ጋር ሊነጻጸር ይችላል** - The passage compares lion prides to packs of hyenas and dogs.
*   **C: ወንዶቹም ሴቶቹም ለታዳኝ እጅግ በጣም አደገኛ ናቸው** - The passage states lion prides are ""very dangerous to their prey""."
ጥንቸሎች የተለመደ ታዳኝ የሆኑት ለየትኛው አዳኝ ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: መካከለኛ-መጠን ድመቶች**.

The passage states: ""P: በእነሱ ሥር ከጥንቸል እስከ አጋዘን ያሉ መካከለኛ መጠን ያላቸው እንስሶችን የሚበሉ መካከለኛ መጠን ያላቸው ድመቶች አሉ።"" This directly tells us that medium-sized cats eat grasshoppers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ትናንሽ ድመቶች** - The passage states small cats eat *very* small creatures like insects and birds, not grasshoppers.
*   **B: ግዙፍ ድመቶች** - The passage doesn't mention large cats eating grasshoppers.
*   **D: አንቴሎፖች** - Antelopes are herbivores (plant eaters), not cats, and not mentioned in relation to grasshoppers."
ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ ትናንሽ ድመቶች በተለምዶ የሚያድኑት የትኛውን ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: አይጦችን**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...finally, there are many small cats that eat a vast number of small animals such as insects, lizards, snails and birds (including large domestic cats’ prey)."" 

Therefore, small cats commonly prey on lizards (아이ጥ). The other options are either too large (antelopes) or are prey for the medium-sized cats (beetles, gazelles)."
ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ የኦሴሎትt የአደን ዘዴ አካል ያልሆነው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: መጠናቸው አነስተኛ የሆኑ እንስሳቶችን ብቻ ነው የሚያድኑት**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states ocelots prey on animals *much larger* than themselves.** This directly contradicts option D, which says they only prey on small animals.
* The passage explicitly mentions these as parts of their hunting method:
    * **A: ከከባቢያቸው ጋር መመሳሰል (Camouflaging with their surroundings)** - ""Ocelots blend in with their surroundings to ambush prey.""
    * **B: የታዳኛቸውን ሽታ መከተል (Following the scent of their prey)** - ""Scientists believe ocelots follow animals by sniffing the ground...""
    * **C: ታዳኛቸውን በምሽት መከተል (Hunting at night)** - ""They can see well in the dark...""

Therefore, only option D is *not* a part of the ocelot's hunting strategy."
ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ ኦሴሎትን በትክክል የማይገልጸው የትኛው ነው? ,"The correct answer is **C: የማሽተት ብቃታቸው ደካማ ነው**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""የሳይንስ ሊቃውንት ኦሴሎትስ/የበረሃ ድመቶች በምድር ላይ ለነበሩበት ቦታ እየነፉ በማሽተት የሚመገቡትን (እንስሳትን) እንስሳት ተከትለው ያገኛሉ።"" This means ocelots have a *strong* sense of smell, not a weak one.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the passage:

* **A: ምሽት ላይ በሚገባ ማደን ይችላሉ** - The passage states: ""በምሽት ዕይታ በደንብ ማየት ይችላሉ"" which supports their ability to hunt well at night.
* **B: የሚንቀሳቀሱት ድምጽ ሳያሰሙ ነው** - The passage says they move ""በጥሩ ሁኔታ"" implying stealth and quiet movement.
* **D: ትናንሽ እንስሳቶችን ማደን ይመርጣሉ** - The passage clearly states: ""ኦሴሎትስ/የበረሃ ድመቶች ትናንሽ እንስሳትን መብላት ይወዳሉ።""



"
ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ የነብር ትልቁ ጥንካሬ እንደሆነ የማይቆጠረው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ማጓራት**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that only tigers, lions, leopards, and jaguars can swim. While the tiger *can* swim, it isn't presented as a significant strength – the passage notes it's not a *good* swimmer. The other options (climbing, jumping, and wrestling) are all described as capabilities of the tiger. Therefore, swimming is the least highlighted strength."
በምንባቡ መሰረት በነብሮች እና አንበሶች መካከል ያለው ልዩነት የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: የማጓራት ድምጻቸው**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""የነብር ጩኸት እንደ አንበሳ የሙሉ ድምፅ ጩኸት አይደለም፣ ግን የበለጠ እንደ አረፍተ ነገር ጫጫታ እና ጩኸት ቃላቶች ነው፡፡"" (The tiger's roar isn't a full-throated roar like a lion's, but more of a chatter and a succession of coughs and shouts.) This directly highlights a difference in their vocalizations (how they roar).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የመዋኘት ብቃታቸው (Their swimming ability):** The passage says both can swim.
*   **C: የመዝለል ርቀታቸው (Their jumping distance):** The passage states both can jump.
*   **D: የመሳብ ኃይላቸው (Their strength in wrestling):** The passage says a tiger can wrestle with five times the strength of a human, but doesn't compare this to a lion's strength.

The passage explicitly states: ""የሞቱ ህዋሶችን ለመመልከት የመጀመሪያው ሰው ነበር"" (He was the first person to observe dead cells). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: አካል ህዋስን ለመመልከት አጉሊ መነጽር መጠቀም** - While he *used* a microscope, the text doesn’t say he was the first to use it for observing cells.
* **C: ትናንሽ ካሬዎችን መመልከት** - He saw shapes that *looked like* small squares, but the important part is *what* he was observing - dead cells.
* **D: የአካለ ህዋስ አነስተኛ የተግባር ክፍሎችን ማግኘት** -  He didn't identify the functional aspects of cells, just observed their structure.



"
“ህዋስ” የሚለው ቃል መነሻ ምን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **B: ትንሽ ክፍል**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ሴል የሚለው ቃል ሴላ ከሆነው የላቲን ቃል የመጣ ሲሆን ትንሽ ክፍል ማለት ነው።"" (The word ""cell"" comes from the Latin word ""cella,"" which means a small room/compartment/small part.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ትናንሽ ካሬዎች** - Robert Hooke saw *shapes* that *looked like* small squares, but that wasn't the origin of the *word* ""cell.""
*   **C: ትንሽ ቅርጽ** - This is too general. The Latin root specifically means ""small room/compartment"".
*   **D: ትናንሽ ኳሶች** - The passage mentions seeing squares, not spheres."
በምንባቡ መሰረት አብዛኛዎቹ እንስሳቶች ምን የማድረግ ብቃት ነው ያላቸው?,"The correct answer is **B: መንቀሳቀስ (Moving)**.

The passage states: ""አብዛኛዎቹ እንስሳቶች መንቀሳቀስ ይችላሉ"" which translates to ""Most animals are able to move.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የመብረር (Flying)** - The passage says some animals *fly* (""በሰማይ ላይ ይበራሉ"") but doesn't say *most* animals fly.
*   **C: የመዋኘት (Swimming)** - The passage says some animals *swim* (""ውቅያኖስ ውስጥ ይዋኛሉ"") but doesn't say *most* animals swim.
*   **D: የመቆፈር (Digging)** - The passage says some animals *dig* (""ጉድጓድ ውስጥ ይቆፍራሉ"") but doesn't say *most* animals dig.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት አንዳንድ እንስሳቶች የሌላቸው ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: አንጎሎች**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""እንስሳቶች ብቻ ናቸው አንጎል ያላቸው (ይህም ሆኖ ሁሉም እንስሳቶች እንኳን የላቸውም፣ ዝልግልግ ዓሣዎች ለምሳሌ አንጎል የላቸውም)."" This directly means that not all animals have brains; some animals, like jellyfish, do not.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሴሎች (Cells)**: The passage states animals *are* made of many cells.
*   **B: የመፍጨት ችሎታ (Ability to digest)**: The passage states animals eat and digest.
*   **D: የመብላት ችሎታ (Ability to eat)**: The passage states animals eat.



"
እጽዋት በፎቶሴዘሲስ ሂደት ላይ የሚያግዛቸው ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: ፀሐይ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""እጽዋት ከፀሀይ በብርሃን አስተፃምሮ ምግባቸውን ያዘጋጃሉ።"" This translates to ""Plants prepare their food using sunlight through photosynthesis."" Therefore, sunlight is essential for the process of photosynthesis that plants use to create food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ጥላ (Shadow)** - The passage says plants *provide* shade, not that they need it for photosynthesis.
*   **B: እንስሳቶች (Animals)** - While plants and animals have a relationship, the passage doesn't state animals help with photosynthesis.
*   **C: ምግብ (Food)** - Plants *make* food, they don't need it to start the process of making it.



"
ሰዎች የሚያስወጡት እጽዋቶች የሚያስገቡት ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: ካርቦን ዳይ ኦክሳይድ**.

The passage explicitly states: ""እጽዋት ከፀሀይ በብርሃን አስተፃምሮ ምግባቸውን ያዘጋጃሉ። ... እንዲሁም ሰዎች የሚያወጡትን ካርቦን-ዳይኦክሳይድን ይወስዳሉ (ማለትም ወደ ውጭ የሚተነፈሰውን).""

This means plants take in the carbon dioxide that people exhale.

በምንባቡ መሰረት ከሚከተሉት ምሳሌዎች ውስጥ የዝግመተ ለውጥን ሂደት ያስተጓጓላል?,"The correct answer is **D: አንድ ሕዝብ በስተመጨረሻ ሁለት መሆን**.

Here's why:

* **The passage defines speciation as the process of creating new species.** This happens *after* all the other steps have occurred - the initial split, adaptation to a new environment, and divergence. The final result *is* the two populations becoming distinct enough to be considered separate species.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: አነስተኛ ቡድኖች በአዲስ አካባቢ ውስጥ መስፋፋት** - This is the *start* of the process, not the driving force of change.
* **B: የአንድ ሕዝብ ክፍል ወደ አዲስ ከባቢ መንቀሳቀስ** - This is the initial separation, but doesn't guarantee speciation.
* **C: አንድ ሕዝብ በአዲስ ከባቢ ውስጥ መላመዱን ማስተካከል** - This is adaptation, a key component *leading* to speciation, but isn't the full process itself.

**In short, speciation is the end result of the entire process described in the passage.** Therefore, option D best represents the process the paragraph is describing."

ደምን ወደ ልብ የሚያመጣው የደም ዝውውር ስርዓት ክፍል የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: የደም ስሮች (Veins)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ደም አርተሪ በሚባሉ ትቦዎች ከልብ ይወጣል እና ቬን በሚባሉ ትቦዎች ወደ ልብ ይመለሳል።"" This directly translates to: ""Blood leaves the heart through arteries and returns to the heart through veins.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: የደም ቧንቧዎች (Blood vessels):** This is too general. It includes arteries *and* veins.
* **B: ካፒላሪዎች (Capillaries):** Capillaries are the smallest blood vessels and facilitate exchange of substances *between* blood and tissues, they don't directly return blood to the heart.
* **C: አካሎች (Bodies/Cells):** While the body *uses* the blood, it doesn't *transport* it back to the heart.



"
በደም ዝውውር ስርዓት ውስጥ ትንሾቹ ቱቦዎች የትኞቹ ናቸው?,"The correct answer is **A: ካፒላሪዎች (Capillaries)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""ትንንሾቹ ትቦዎች ካፒላሪ ይባላሉ"" which translates to ""The smallest tubes are called capillaries.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: የደም ቧንቧዎች (Arteries and veins)** - These are the larger tubes, not the smallest.
* **C: የደም ስሮች (Veins)** - These are the tubes that carry blood *to* the heart, not the smallest.
* **D: አካሎች (Bodies)** - This isn't related to blood vessels.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that being able to fold their wings back ""gives them a wide range of small spaces to hide from predators.""  The other options are mentioned as benefits of flight in general, but the specific advantage of *folding* wings is camouflage and hiding.

* **A: የምግብ አቅርቦት** - Flight helps find food, but folding wings isn't directly related to that.
* **C: አጣማሪዎችን ማግኘት** - Flight helps find mates, but folding wings isn't directly related to that.
* **D: የበረራ ፍጥነት** - The passage doesn't mention wing-folding affecting flight speed."

Here's why:

*   **The passage states flying helped with:**
    *   **Food acquisition:** ""...efficiently find food...""
    *   **Mate finding:** ""...find a mate...""
    *   **Avoiding predators:** ""...easily evade predators...""
    *   **Protection:** ""...hide from predators in a wide range of small spaces..."" (due to folding wings)

*   **The passage does *not* mention any impact of flight on lifespan.** It doesn’t discuss whether flying made insects live longer or shorter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: መራባት (Reproduction):** The text specifically mentions finding a ""mate,"" which is directly related to reproduction.
*   **C: ምግብ መሰብሰብ (Food gathering):** The text directly states flying helped them “efficiently find food.”
*   **D: ውጤታማነት (Effectiveness):** Flying helped insects be more effective at survival (avoiding predators, finding food and mates).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that people *don't* consider birds to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly. While the passage goes on to explain how birds *are* dinosaurian in many ways, feathers are presented as the primary reason for the common misconception.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በኋላ እግር መራመድ (Walking on hind legs):** The passage specifically mentions T-Rex walked on two hind legs, and birds also do this.
*   **C: እንቁላል መጣል (Laying eggs):** The passage states birds lay eggs, a characteristic shared with dinosaurs.
*   **D: ባለ ጥፍር እግሮች (Clawed feet):** The passage states birds have clawed feet, similar to dinosaurs.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""ብዙ ሰዎች ላባ ስላላቸው እና መብረር ስለሚችሉ እንደ ዳይኖሰር አይቆጥሯቸውም።"" (Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.) This implies flying is a feature that *distinguishes* birds from the common perception of dinosaurs.

Let's look at why the other options are shared characteristics:

*   **A: እንቁላሎች መጣል (Laying eggs):** The passage explicitly states ""እንቁላል ይጥላሉ"" (they lay eggs), a characteristic shared with dinosaurs.
*   **B: ለመራመድ ሁለት የኋላ እግሮችን መጠቀም (Using two hind legs to walk):** The passage mentions ""እንደ ቲ-ሬክስ በሁለት የኋላ እግሮቻቸው ላይ ይራመዳሉ።"" (They walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex), highlighting this shared trait.
*   **D: ጥፍሮች ያሏቸው እግሮች (Having claws on their legs):** The passage states ""ጥርሶች እና ጥፍሮች ያሉት እግሮች አሏቸው"" (They have beaks and claws on their legs), indicating this is a shared feature.

Therefore, the ability to fly is the characteristic *not* generally considered a shared trait between birds and dinosaurs according to the text."

It also directly mentions they could eat the ""ሹል ፣ የሾሉ ቅጠሎች"" (spiky leaves) of the *ไซแคด* plants.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ግንዱ** (The trunk) - The passage says they would eat the *leaves* *before* getting to the trunk, implying the trunk wasn't a primary food source.
* **C: ስሩን** (The root) - The passage specifically mentions Triceratops could break even strong branches *and* roots, but doesn't say they *ate* the roots. It focuses on their ability to damage them.
* **D: ፍሬውን** (The fruit) - The passage doesn't mention Triceratops eating the fruit of the *ไซแคด* plant.

The passage states that *Triceratops* could crush even strong branches and roots with its powerful beak. This directly indicates its ability to consume plants with tough, woody parts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ስሎዝ (Sloths):** The passage only *compares* what sloths and macaws eat *to* what Triceratops might have eaten, it doesn’t suggest Triceratops ate the same things.
*   **C: በቀቀን (Macaws):** Same reasoning as with sloths.
*   **D: መርዛማ ፍሬ ያለው ተክል (Toxic fruit):** The passage states some researchers believe these plants were *too* toxic for any dinosaur to eat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: የአውሮፓ ህብረትን መቀላቀል (Joining the European Union):** While joining the EU was significant for Luxembourg, it didn't *impact* its neutrality, it arguably changed its focus and role in Europe.

በምንባቡ መሠረት በየትኛው ቦታ ላይ ነው አብዛኞቹ ቤቶች ፍለሽ ያለው መጸዳጃ ቤቶችን ያካተቱት?,"The correct answer is **A: ሞሄንጆ-ዳሮ**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that the cities of **Harappa and Mohenjo-daro** were connected to a sophisticated drainage system, and **each house had a flush toilet.** The other options are mentioned as having toilets, but not as universally including flush toilets *in each house* like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had sophisticated drainage systems *connected to flush toilets in every house*. While the passage mentions drainage and toilets existed in Crete (Santorini), Egypt, Persia, and China, it highlights Harappa as having the *most advanced* system with flush toilets.

Therefore, the best answer is Harappa."
ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ ስኬተር እንዲዞር የሚያደርገው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: በስኬቱ ምላጭ ግርጌ ላይ ያለው ትንሽ ጥምዝ**.

The passage explicitly states that the slight curvature on the bottom of the blade (the ""little notch"" or ""bend"") is what causes the skate to turn. When the blade leans, this curvature creates more contact on one edge, resulting in a turn in that direction.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: በስኬቱ ምላጭ ላይ ያሉት ድርብ ጠርዞች:** While the double edge is important for grip, the passage states the *curvature* is what controls the turning.
* **C: የስኬተሩ አጠቃላይ የችሎታ ደረጃ:** The skill of the skater is important, but doesn't explain *how* the skate turns.
* **D: የበረዶው ጥራት:** Ice quality affects how well a skate grips, but isn't the mechanism causing the turn.

ምንባቡ መሰረት ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ በዘመናዊ ስኬት ምላጭ ላይ ያለውን ክፍተት በትክክል የሚገልጸው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ድርብ ጠርዝ**.

The passage explicitly states the blade has a ""ድርብ ጠርዝ"" (double edge) with a gap between them. This is the key feature described and the basis for how the skates work.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ጥምዝ (curve/bend):** While the bottom of the blade is slightly curved, the passage focuses on the *two edges* created by that curve, not just the curve itself.
* **C: ሾጣጣ (point):** The passage doesn't mention a point on the blade, only edges.
* **D: ያዘነበለ (leaning):**  ""ያዘነበለ"" refers to the skater leaning, which *causes* the turn, but isn’t the feature of the blade itself.

በምንባቡ መሰረት አተሞች ከብርሃን የሚመጣውን የበዛ ኃይል እንዴት ነው የሚያስወግዱት?,"The correct answer is **B: የተነቃቃ የፎቶን ልቀት**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that atoms remove excess energy from light by releasing tiny packets of light called "" photons"" and that scientists call this process ""stimulated emission"". The passage also states that stimulated emission is when atoms become excited by light and cause the release of photon light. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ጨረር (Radiation)** - While light *is* a form of radiation, the passage describes a specific *process* of releasing energy as radiation, not radiation itself.
*   **C: ፎቶን (Photon)** - Photons are *what* is released, not *how* the energy is removed.
*   **D: የተነቃቃ የጨረር ልቀት (Stimulated Radiation Emission)** - The passage uses the term ""የተነቃቃ የጨረር ልቀት"" (stimulated emission) and states that it's because light is a type of radiation, but focuses on the emission of photons."
አንድ አተም ፎቶንን እንዲለቅ የሚያደርገው ምንድነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ያልተረጋጉ የኃይል ደረጃዎች**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ወደ ቀደመው የኃይል ደረጃቸው ለመመለስ ከብርሃን ያገኙትን ተጨማሪ ኃይል ማስወገድ አለባቸው."" This directly means atoms release photons to return to a stable energy level after being excited (gaining energy).  Unstable energy levels *require* the atom to release energy to become stable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: የበዛ ኃይል መልቀቅ (Excess energy release):** While true that energy is released, the passage specifies *why* and *how* (through photons due to unstable levels), not just that excess energy is released.
* **B: በደማቅ ብርሃን የተከሰተ ልቀት (Emission caused by bright light):** The passage explains the emission is a response to *having received* light energy, not just due to the presence of bright light. The initial absorption of energy is key.
* **D: ለጨረር አሉታዊ ምላሽ (Negative response to radiation):**  The process isn’t a “negative response.” It’s a natural process of returning to a stable state after excitation.

በምንባቡ መሠረት አንድ አምፖል በስተመጨረሻ ሥራውን እንዲያቆም የሚያደርገው ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: በአምፑል ውስጥ ያለው ክር መቃጠል**.

Here's why:

The passage states directly: ""ከመቶ ሰዓታት ሥራ በኋላ በአምፖል ውስጥ ያለው ክር በመጨረሻ ይቃጠላል እና አምፖሉ ከእዛ በዋላ አይሠራም"" (After one hundred hours of work, the filament inside the bulb finally burns out and the bulb no longer works). This is the stated reason the bulb stops functioning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የመብራት መሳሪያው በትክክል አለመጥፋት (The light fixture not being turned off properly):** This is a safety precaution for *replacing* the bulb, not the reason it burns out.
*   **B: የአምፖሉን የብረት መሰረት በከፊል ብቻ በሶኬቱ ውስጥ ማኖር (Partially having the metal base of the bulb in the socket):** This is a safety hazard during replacement.
*   **D: ወደ ሶኬት ውስጥ የሚሄደው የኤሌክትሪክ ፍሰት ፍጥነት መቀነስ (The rate of electric current going into the socket decreasing):** The passage doesn't mention anything about the current decreasing as a cause of the bulb failing.



"
ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ አምፖሉን በሚተካበት ጊዜ መንካት አደገኛ ሊሆን የሚችለው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: የአምፖሉ መሰረት**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that touching the metal base of the bulb while it's still partially in the socket can cause a severe electric shock. The metal base is the part that connects to the electricity flow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ክሩ (The bulb/filament)** - The filament burns out, it's no longer electrically active.
*   **B: ማብሪያ/ማጥፊያ (The switch)** - You need to turn this *off* to safely change the bulb, so it's not dangerous to touch *when off*.
*   **D: ገመዱ (The cord)** - Disconnecting the cord is one way to make it safe, but the cord itself isn't the part that will shock you if touched during a bulb change.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት ኒውክለስ ሲካፈል ምን ይፈጠራል?,"The correct answer is **B: ኃይል ይለቀቃል (Energy is released)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ኒውክሊየሱን እንደገና በመክፈል ከዚያ የተወሰነውን ኃይል ይለቀቃል።"" which translates to ""By splitting the nucleus, some of the energy is released.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ፕሩቶኖች ይጨምራሉ (Protons increase):** The passage doesn't mention protons increasing during nuclear fission.
*   **C: አተሞች ያልተረጋጉ ይሆናሉ (Atoms become unstable):** The passage says *some* atoms *have* unstable nuclei, but fission itself doesn't necessarily create instability in other atoms.
*   **D: ኒውትሮኖች ይጠፋሉ (Neutrons disappear):** Fission actually often *releases* neutrons, it doesn't make them disappear.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that when calling someone thousands of miles away, you are using **satellites** to transmit the call. The satellite receives and reflects the call. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ቴሌስኮፖች (Telescopes)** - Telescopes are used to observe light and images from space, not to relay phone calls.
*   **C: ብርሃኖች (Lights)** - Lights are mentioned as being distorted by the Earth's atmosphere, but they don't handle phone calls.
*   **D: ሮኬቶች (Rockets)** - Rockets *launch* satellites and telescopes into space, but they don't handle the phone calls themselves.



"
ከእነዚህ ውስጥ ቴሌስኮፕን ጠፈር ላይ ለማድረግ የሚያገለግሉት የትኞቹ ናቸው?,"The correct answer is **B: ሮኬቶች**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states: ""በጠፈር ላይ ሳተላይት ወይም ቴሌስኮፕን ለማስገባት ከ 100 ጫማ ከፍታ በላይ ያለው አንድ ግዙፍ ሮኬት ያስፈልጋል።"" (To get a satellite or telescope into space, a huge rocket that is over 100 feet high is needed.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የብርሃን ጨረሮች (Light rays)** - Light rays are mentioned in the context of the atmosphere distorting them, but they don't *put* telescopes into space.
*   **C: የምድር አየር (Earth's air)** - The air is a *reason* telescopes are put in space (to avoid distortion), not a tool to do so.
*   **D: ከ 100 ጫማ ከፍታ በላይ ያሉ ሳተላይቶች (Satellites over 100 feet high)** - Satellites are *placed* in space, but they are not the thing that *gets* them there. Rockets are used to launch them."
የጊዜን ማለፍን ለመከታተል ስለ ዑደታዊ ክስተት የትኛው ትኩረት ሊሰጠው ይገባል?,"The correct answer is **B: ድግግሞሽ (Frequency)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that we experience time through ""ተደጋጋሚ ድርጊቶች"" (repeated events) and that ""የጊዜ ማለፍን እየተመላለሰ የሚከናወን ድርጊትን በተደጋጋሚ በማስተዋል... ማረጋገጥ የሚችሉ"" (you can confirm the passage of time by repeatedly observing a regularly occurring event).  This focuses on the *frequency* with which events happen as a way to perceive time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ቆይታ (Duration)** - While duration is mentioned as something we *compare* with time, the passage focuses on the repetitive nature of events *to* track time's passage, not just how long things take.
*   **C: ተጽዕኖ (Influence)** - The passage mentions time's influence, but this isn't what we focus on to *track* its passage.
*   **D: አስቸጋሪነት (Difficulty)** - The passage notes time is difficult to understand, but this isn’t related to how we experience it passing.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት የትኛው የክስተት ክፍል ነው ጊዜን ለማነጻጸሪያ የሚጠቀመው?,"The correct answer is **B: ድግግሞሽ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ጊዜ ... የድርጊቶችን ቆይታ (የርዝመት) የምናወዳድርበት ነው። እየተመላለሰ የሚከናወን ድርጊትን በተደጋጋሚ በማስተዋል የጊዜ ማለፍን እርስዎም ማረጋገጥ የሚችሉ ሲሆን እየተመላለሰ የሚከናወን ድርጊት ማለት በመደበኛነት እየተደጋገመ የሚከናወን ድርጊት ማለት ነው ።"" 

This directly links our perception of time to *repeated* or *recurring* events (ድግግሞሽ). We measure time by observing how often things happen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ርዝመት** - While the passage mentions duration (""ርዝመት""), it says we *compare* durations, not that duration *is* the element used to define time.
*   **C: ልምድ** - Experience helps us *perceive* time, but it isn't the fundamental element used to measure it.
*   **D: ተጽዕኖ** - Time *has* an influence, but isn't defined by influence itself."

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""ተለምዶ የዙፋኑ ወራሽ ትምህርቱን ከጨረሰ በኋላ በቀጥታ ወደ ጦር ኃይሉ ይገባል"" (Traditionally, the heir to the throne joins the armed forces immediately after finishing his education). This implies that going to university *before* joining the armed forces is the typical pattern.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 2:2 ዲግሪ ማግኘት (Getting a 2:2 degree):** Charles getting this degree was notable *because* it was a lower second-class degree, not because it was typical.
*   **B: ውትድርናን ለመቀላቀል ዩኒቨርሲቲ መተው (Leaving university to join the military):** Charles didn't leave university to join the military; he finished his degree.
*   **C: ታሪክ ማጥናት (Studying history):** While Charles *did* study history, the passage doesn't state that studying history is typical for heirs."

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""በብሪታንያ ሮያል ቤተሰብ የመጀመሪያ ዲግሪ በመውሰድ ቻርለስ የመጀመሪያው ሰው ነበር"" which translates to ""Charles was the first person to earn a degree from the British Royal Family.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ትምህርት ከመጨረሱ በፊት ዩኒቨርሲቲ መግባት** - While he *did* go to university, the passage emphasizes earning the degree, not just attending.
*   **B: አርኪዮሎጂ ማጥናት** - He studied archaeology, but that's not what made him first - it was completing the degree.
*   **D: ስነ መለኮት ኮሌጅ መማር** - He attended Selwyn College, not a theology college, and again the passage focuses on the degree itself.

Here's why:

The passage states the influence was around the 15th century. Counting back from today (2024), the 15th century was approximately 600 years ago. 

*   15th century: 1401-1500
*   2024 - 1400 = 624 years ago (approximately 600 years)"
የኢስቶኒያ ቋንቋ ተጽዕኖ ያደረበት በምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: የጀርመን ፊደል**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Estonian was *based on* the German alphabet. While the other options are related to the story, they aren't the *influence* on the language itself.

*   **A: Õ/õ ቁምፊ** - This is a *result* of the influence, not the influence itself.
*   **C: የጀርመን መነኩሴዎች** - They were agents *of* the influence, not the influence itself.
*   **D: ፈጣሪ** - This is too general; the passage doesn't say who created the language, just that it was formed.

በምንባቡ መሰረት የሂንዱ ቋንቋ ተናጋሪዎች ብዛት የሚቀያየረው በየትኛው ተጽዕኖ ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ከህንድ ጋር በጣም የሚመሳሰሉ ዘዬዎች ከተቆጠሩ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ተናጋሪዎች ብዛት ይለያያል። በጣም በቅርብ የሚዛመዱ ዘዬዎች መቆጠር ወይም አለመቆጠር መሠረት የተወላጅ ተናጋሪዎች ብዛት ይለያያል።"" This directly links the variation in the number of Hindi speakers to whether closely related dialects are included in the count.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: የኡርዱ ተናጋሪዎች ከተቆጠሩ:** While Hindi and Urdu are similar, the passage doesn't say including Urdu speakers changes the *Hindi* speaker count. It says they're mutually intelligible.
*   **C: ቋንቋው የሚገባቸው ሰዎች ከተቆጠሩ:** The passage mentions understanding the language (800 million), but this affects the number of *comprehenders*, not necessarily speakers.
*   **D: ቋንቋውን ማንበብ የሚችሉ ሰዎች ከተቆጠሩ:** The passage highlights the difference in *written* form between Hindi and Urdu, but doesn't connect literacy to the variation in speaker counts.

The passage explicitly states: ""ህንዲኛ እና ኡርዱ በመዝገበ ቃላታቸው ተመሳሳይ ነገር ግን በጽሁፍ የተለያዩ ናቸው"". (Hindi and Urdu are similar in their vocabulary but different in writing).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: አብዛኛውን ጊዜ በሁለቱም ቋንቋ ተናጋሪዎች መካከል መለያያ አለ** - The passage says the opposite; they can often understand each other.
*   **C: በመዝገበ ቃላትም በጽሁፍም ተመሳሳይ ናቸው** - The passage states they are *not* the same in writing.
*   **D: በመዝገበ ቃላይ ይመሳሰላሉ** - While true, it's not the most complete or defining characteristic mentioned in the text. The text highlights the *difference* in writing as key.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ውስብስብነት (Complexity)** - The passage mentions Sanskrit *is* complex, but doesn't say complexity caused its decline.
*   **B: የአርያን ፍልሰት (Aryan Migration)** - The passage mentions Aryan migration as a theory about Sanskrit's *origin*, not its decline.
*   **C: የላቲን ቋንቋዎች (Latin Languages)** - Latin languages are mentioned as a comparison to Sanskrit's influence, not a reason for its decline.

Here's why:

The passage states that you would weigh less on Io than on Earth. Weight is a measure of the force of gravity.  Since you weigh less on Io, the gravitational force on Io must be weaker than the gravitational force on Earth. Therefore, Earth's gravity pulls on you with less force than Io's gravity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: የአዮ ስበት የበለጠ ይስባል፣ ለዚህም ነው ክብደትዎ የሚቀለው** - Incorrect. If Io's gravity were stronger, you would *weigh more*, not less.
* **C: የአዮ ስበት የበለጠ ይስባል፣ ለዚህም ነው የበለጠ የሚከብዱት** - Incorrect.  The passage states you weigh *less* on Io.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ቀረብ የሚለው ጎን ወፈር ያለ ክረስት አለው:** The passage states the *far* side has a thicker crust (100km) compared to the near side (70km).
*   **B: በደጋ አካባቢዎች ላይ ክረስቱ ቀጠን ያለ ነው:** The passage says the crust is *thinner* under the maria and *thicker* under the highlands (ደጋ).
*   **D: ከደጋዎቹ ስር ያነሰ ማርያ ሊኖር ይችላል:** The passage implies the opposite - maria are more likely to form where the crust is thinner, like near the highlands.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሰዎች ወደ ሌሎች ከዋክብት ተጉዘዋል** - The passage says people *dream* of traveling to other planets, but doesn't state anyone has actually done so.

ከጸሀይ መሀል ይበልጥ እየራቁ ሲሄዱ እየቀጠነ የሚመጣው ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ጋዝ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ከፀሐይ መሃል ርቀው ሲሄዱ ጋዙ ይበልጥ ቀጭን ይሆናል።"" This directly translates to ""As you move away from the center of the sun, the gas becomes thinner.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ፕላዝማ** - While the sun *contains* plasma, the passage doesn't say it's what becomes thinner as you move outward.
*   **B: እሳት** - The passage mentions fire as a component of the sun, but doesn't state it thins out.
*   **D: ቅርፊት** - The passage explicitly states the sun *doesn't* have a surface.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት ከመሬት ላይ የሚታየው የጸሀይ ክፍል የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ፎቶስፊሩ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ፀሐይን ስንመለከት የምናየው የውጭው ክፍል ፎቶስፌር ተብሎ ይጠራል"" (When we look at the sun, the outer part we see is called the photosphere).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ቅርፊቱ** - The passage says the sun *doesn't have* a surface like Earth.
*   **B: ፕላዝማው** - Plasma is a component of the sun, but not the specific part we see.
*   **D: መሀሉ** - We don't see the sun's core directly.

ከሚከተሉት ምልከታዎች ውስጥ የኮፐርኒከስን ጽንሰ ሀሳብ ያረጋገጠው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: የቬነስ ምዕራፍ (phases of Venus)**.

Here's why:

* **Copernicus's heliocentric model** proposed that planets revolve around the Sun. This model predicted that Venus would exhibit a full range of phases (like the Moon) as it orbits the Sun and as viewed from Earth.
* **Galileo's observation of Venus's phases** *directly supported* this prediction. If Venus orbited the Earth (as the geocentric model suggested), it would only show crescent phases.  The observation of full and gibbous phases of Venus proved the heliocentric model was correct.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: የቬነስ ሽግግር (transit of Venus)** – While Horrocks' observation of the transit of Venus was important, it *confirmed* the heliocentric model after it had already been supported by Galileo's work, rather than being the initial evidence.
* **C: ምድር ከቬነስ ጋር ያላት ተመሳሳይነት (similarity between Earth and Venus)** – Similarities between planets don't directly prove planetary orbits.
* **D: ጸሀይ ከጨረቃ ጋር ያላት ተመሳሳይነት (similarity between the Sun and the Moon)** – This is irrelevant to the debate about planetary orbits.



"
ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ በ 1610 በጋሊሊዮ ጋሊሊ የታየው የትኛው ነበር?,"The correct answer is **B: የቬነስ ምዕራፍ (phases of Venus)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that in 1610, Galileo Galilei observed that Venus has phases ""using a telescope."" The phases are explained as being due to the changing amount of Venus lit by the sun as it orbits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ወደ ጸሀይ የዞረው የጨረቃ ጎን (The side of the moon facing the sun):** While Galileo *also* observed the moon, the question specifically asks about what he observed in 1610 related to the passage's focus on Venus.
*   **C: ፕላኔቶች በጸሀይ ዙሪያ መሄዳቸው (That planets orbit the sun):** Galileo's observations of Venus' phases *supported* Copernicus's idea, but he didn't directly observe the orbits themselves. He observed evidence that *led* to that conclusion.
*   **D: የቬነስ ሽግግር (Venus' transit):** The passage states that Jeremiah Horrocks observed Venus' transit in 1639, not Galileo in 1610.

This directly indicates that the Amazon River collects water from many smaller rivers."
ለአማዞን ወንዝ የማይገባው ማዕረግ የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ረጅሙ ወንዝ ነው (the longest river)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the Amazon is the *second* longest river, not the longest. 
* The other options are all accurate descriptions from the text:
    * **A: ሁለተኛው ረጅሙ ወንዝ ነው (second longest river)** - Directly stated in the passage.
    * **B: ትልቁ ወንዝ ነው (biggest river)** - Stated as being the largest in terms of water volume.
    * **D: ሰፊው ወንዝ ነው (widest river)** -  The passage mentions it can be six miles wide.

Here's why:

The passage states that only one percent of Venezuelans work in the oil industry, despite it being a crucial industry for the country. This is the smallest percentage mentioned for any specific sector.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ግብርና** - One-fifth (20%) of Venezuelans work in agriculture.
*   **B: ኢንዱስትሪ** - One-quarter (25%) of Venezuelans work in industry.
*   **D: አገልግሎት** - Two-thirds (approximately 67%) of Venezuelans work in the service sector.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""two thirds of Venezuelans work in the service sector."" This is a larger proportion than those working in industry (one quarter) or agriculture (one fifth). While oil is important, it only employs 1% of Venezuelans.

Therefore, the service sector employs the highest number of Venezuelans."

The passage states ""ኮከቦች ብርሃንና ሙቀት ይሰጣሉ። ሳይንቲስቶች በተመሳሳይ መንገድ ኃይል ሊያመነጭ የሚችል ሬአክተር ለመፍጠር እየሰሩ ነው።"" This directly links fusion (the joining of hydrogen atoms) in stars to the production of light and heat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ከከባድ ንጥረ ነገሮች:** While fusion *creates* heavier elements, the passage doesn't say this is what it *enables* stars to do. It's a result of the process, not the primary function described.
*   **B: የውህደት ሬአክተሮችን መገንባት:** This is something scientists are *trying* to do, not what fusion does in stars.
*   **D: የሃይድሮጂን አተሞችን መፍጠር:** Fusion *uses* hydrogen atoms, it doesn't create them.



"
ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ ጠቃሚ የውህደት ሬአክተር የሚፈጥረው የትኛውን ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: ኃይል (Energy)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that scientists are working to create a reactor that can produce *energy* in the same way stars do through nuclear fusion. The whole point of building a fusion reactor is to generate power.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሃይድሮጂን (Hydrogen):** Hydrogen is the *fuel* for the reactor, not what it produces.
*   **B: ኮከቦች (Stars):** The reactor is trying to *mimic* stars, not create them.
*   **C: አተሞች (Atoms):**  Fusion involves atoms, but the result isn't just atoms – it's the energy released when they fuse.

የውሃ ኬሚካላዊ ስሪት ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: ሁለት የሃይድሮጂን አተሞች እና አንድ የኦክሲጅን አተም**.

The text explicitly states: ""ውሃ የሚባለው ውህድ ከሁለት ሃይድሮጅን አቶሞችን እና አንድ ኦክሲጅን አቶም የተሰራ ነው።"" which translates to ""Water is a compound made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.""

ውሃ ሁኔታውን ሲቀይር ተመሳሳይ ሆኖ የሚቆየው ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ሞለኪውላዊ መዋቅር (Molecular structure)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that water, whether gas, liquid, or solid, has the **same molecular structure** (two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom). This is what remains constant during a change of state.
*   **ጥግግት (Density)** changes with state (gas is less dense than liquid, solid is usually denser).
*   **አካላዊ ሁኔታ (Physical state)** is *what changes* – the question asks what *stays the same*.
*   **ፈሳሽ ናይትሮጂን (Liquid nitrogen)** is just an example used in the passage; it's not what remains constant in water.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that the Articles of Confederation required unanimous consent from all states to be ratified and amendments needed unanimous approval. This made it incredibly difficult to make any changes or enforce laws effectively, as a single state could block progress. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ከግዛት ባለስልጣናት ከፍተኛ ቁጥጥር:** The passage actually points to this *being* a problem - the states held too much power, and the central government relied on them for enforcement.
*   **B: በኮንግረስ ውስጥ የኃይል እጥረት:** This is also a problem highlighted in the passage (no power to tax, no executive or judicial branch).
*   **D: የማይገኝ ብሄራዊ ስራ አስፈፃሚ:** This is another weakness of the Articles, but the question asks about what specifically made it hard to *pass* laws, not enforce them.

Therefore, the need for unanimous approval for amendments (option C) is the direct reason why the states had trouble enacting some laws."

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ተወካዮቻቸው በአብዛኛው ቀሪ ነበሩ"" (their representatives were largely absent) due to states not fully supporting the central government and the requirement for unanimous consent for changes. This directly reflects a problem with attendance and participation by state representatives.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ታክሶች የሚጫኑት በኮንግረስ እና በግዛት ባለስልጣኖች ነበር (Taxes were levied by Congress and state officials):** The passage specifically says Congress *couldn't* tax.
* **B: በአንቀጾቹ ላይ የሚደረጉ ማሻሻያዎች በኮንግረሱ ስልጣን ላይ ጥገኛ ነበሩ (Amendments to the Articles depended on the power of Congress):** The passage states the opposite – amendments required *unanimous* state approval, not just Congressional power.
* **D: ማዕከላዊ መንግስት ሁለት ዋና ክፍሎች አሉት (The central government had two main divisions):** While there was a Congress, the passage emphasizes its *weakness* and lack of key components (executive and judicial branches), not a structured division.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states** that experts transformed the island into a tropical garden and that a flower was chosen as the national flower. This highlights a focus on greenery and horticulture.
* The other options are not mentioned or implied in the text:
    * **B: በረጅም እግር ጉዞ (long-distance walking)** - The passage doesn't discuss hiking or walking trails.
    * **C: በጀብድ ስፖርቶች (water sports)** - No mention of water sports.
    * **D: በአፈጻጸም ስነ ጥበቦች (performing arts)** - No mention of the arts.

ቫንዳ ሚስ ጃኩዊን ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: አበባ (Flower)**.

Here's why:

The text states ""ቫንዳ ሚስ ጁዋኪም የኦርኪድ ድብልቅ ለሃገሪቱ ብሔራዊ አበባ እንዲሆን ተመረጠ"" - which translates to ""Vanda Miss Joaquim orchid hybrid was chosen as the national flower of the country.""  Therefore, Vanda Miss Joaquim is a flower.

Here's why:

The passage states that the New Kingdom Egyptians were ""astonished by the feats of their predecessors, who had been gone for over a thousand years."" This directly implies the *age* of the pyramids was the most astonishing quality. The pyramids had stood for over a millennium, which would be incredibly impressive to those coming after.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: የድንጋይ አጠቃቀም** - The passage mentions stone construction continued, so the use of stone itself wasn't surprising.
*   **C: መጠናቸው** - The passage explicitly states the pyramids were *never surpassed* in size, meaning the New Kingdom Egyptians wouldn't be astonished by a larger size because none existed.
*   **D: ግንባታቸው** - While the building techniques were advanced, the passage doesn’t highlight this as a point of astonishment, but rather the longevity and enduring presence of the pyramids.

Here's why:

The text states the wildebeest migrate *towards* the northern plains and then *back* from the north, westward, following the rains. Therefore, they are ultimately heading to the western plains.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ሰሜናዊ ኮረብታዎች** - They *start* from the northern highlands, but they don't stay there.
*   **C: ደቡባዊ ሜዳዎች** - The text doesn't mention any southward migration.
*   **D: ምዕራባዊ ኮረብታዎች** - They move *to* the plains, not westward highlands.

Here's why:

The passage states the wildebeest migrate *from* the northern plains and cross the Mara River, and *then* return across the Mara River in April *from* the north-western direction, which is part of the Serengeti region. Therefore, they are coming from the Serengeti in April.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ደቡባዊ ሜዳዎች (Southern plains):** The passage states they *go to* the northern plains, not come from the southern ones in April.
*   **C: ከማራ ወንዝ (From the Mara River):** The wildebeest *cross* the Mara River, they don't originate *from* it.
*   **D: ከማሳይ ማራ ብሔራዊ ሪዘርቭ (From the Masai Mara National Reserve):** While the Masai Mara is *part* of the Serengeti region, the passage describes a broader movement originating from the northern plains/Serengeti area."

The passage explicitly states: ""ጀርመን ጥቃቱን “ኦፕሬሽን ሲላየን” ብላ ሰየመችው።"" (Germany named the attack “Operation Sea Lion”).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ደንኪርክ (Dunkirk)** - Dunkirk is mentioned as a place where English forces retreated *from*, not the name of the operation.
*   **C: ሪግስማሪን (Kriegsmarine)** - This is the name of the German navy.
*   **D: ሮያል ኔቪ (Royal Navy)** - This is the name of the British navy."

Here's why:

The passage states Italy had a weak navy and had *already* built four new ships before the war. It doesn't mention a plan to build *more* ships as part of their strategy for conquering African territories. The passage focuses on:

*   **Removing British ports and ships in Egypt:** To allow passage across the Mediterranean.
*   **Creating a staging ground for troops:**  Needed to invade Africa.
*   **Destroying British shipping:** Implied as necessary for controlling the Mediterranean.

Therefore, building more ships wasn't presented as a necessary step in their plan."

The text explicitly states: ""የጣሊያን ዋና ግቦች የአፍሪካ ሃጋራት ነበሩ። እነሱን ሃገራት ለመያዝ..."" (Italian's main goals were the African territories. To capture those countries...). The other options are *steps* towards achieving that goal, but not the main goal itself.

The passage explicitly states that the ""Vichy French"" were the ones who ""made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them."" 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ጀርመኖች** - They were the ones *with* whom the alliance was formed, not the creators of it.
* **C: አሜሪካኖች** - The passage states they helped *liberate* Southern France, not collaborate.
* **D: ነጻ ፈረንሳይ** - They also fought against the Germans and helped liberate France.

የየትኛው ቴክኖሎጂ እድገት ነው ሰርጓጅ መርከቦች በውሃ ስር መጓዝ እንዲጀምሩ ምክንያት የሆነው?,"The correct answer is **D: Radar**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""የራዳር ማደግ እና የትክክለኛነታቸው እየጨመረ መምጣት ሰርጓጅ መርከቦቹ እንዳይታዩ በውኃ ውስጥ ለመጓዝ ተገደዋል።"" This directly links the development of radar to the submarines needing to travel underwater to avoid detection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ዩ-ጀልባዎች (U-boats)** - U-boats were *types* of submarines, not a technology that caused them to submerge.
*   **B: የመተኮሻ ክልል (Firing range)** - The text mentions limited firing range as a drawback of early submarines, but not as a reason for them to go underwater.
*   **C: ዳሰሳ (Detection)** - While related to radar, radar is the specific technology mentioned as the driving force.



"

The text specifically states: ""ያኔ እነሱ በጣም ቀርፋፋ ነበሩ እና በጣም ውስን የመተኮሻ ክልል ነበራቸው"" which translates to ""Then they were very slow and had a very limited firing range."" 

Therefore, the limitation mentioned when submarines were first used was their firing range."

Here's why:

*   The passage states the Polish defense *planned* to regroup and form a Roman (likely meaning strong/defensive) position. However, the Soviet invasion **prevented** this from happening. The Soviets invaded before Poland could reorganize.
*   The passage explicitly mentions the Red Army **did** engage in:
    *   **A: የዩክሬንያን ጦር ግንባር መፈጠር** - They created Ukrainian fronts.
    *   **B: የምስራቃዊ ክልሎች መወረር** - They invaded Poland's eastern territories.
    *   **D: የስምምነት ጥሰት** - They violated multiple treaties.

Therefore, the Red Army did not carry out the act of reorganizing a defensive position – the invasion disrupted that plan."
በጣሊያን አሥረኛ ጦር ዋና መሐንዲስ ላይ ምን ተፈጠረ?,"The correct answer is **C: በብሪታኒያዎች ተያዘ** (Captured by the British).

The passage states: ""...by a raid east of Bardia the British captured Italian Tenth Army Corps of Engineers chief General Lastucci."" This directly translates to the British capturing General Lastucci.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ፎርት ካፑዞ ላይ ተያዘ** (Captured at Fort Capuzzo) - While there was action at Fort Capuzzo, it was the 11th Hussars who *attacked* the fort, not General Lastucci being captured there.
*   **B: ቶብሩክ ውስጥ ተገደለ** (Killed in Tobruk) - Marshal Balbo was killed in Tobruk, not General Lastucci.
*   **D: ባልታሰበ የራስ ጦር ተገደለ** (Killed by friendly fire) - Marshal Balbo was killed by friendly fire, again, not General Lastucci."

Here's why:

The passage states that Tibetan meditation is a ""divine yoga"" that involves becoming absorbed in different deities. This process is described as purifying energy channels, activating chakras, and generating the light of knowledge.  While the passage mentions other techniques like breathing exercises, mantras, and yoga postures (related to Kundalini yoga), **becoming absorbed in deities** is specifically identified as the core of Tibetan meditation as described in the text.

Here's why:

The text states that in Tibetan meditation (which is a core part of Tibetan Buddhism), ""through the possession of various deities, the energy channels are cleared, chakras are moved, and the light of knowledge is created in consciousness."" This directly links chakra movement to the practice of envisioning deities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: በተለያዩ አይነት የዮጋ አቋሞች** - While Kundalini Yoga *within* Tibetan Buddhism uses postures, the passage specifically connects chakra movement to deity possession during meditation.
* **C: ማንትራስን በመደጋገም** - Mantras are mentioned as a component of Kundalini Yoga but aren't directly linked to chakra movement within the meditation context described.
* **D: የትንፋሽ ልምምዶችን መስራት** - Breathing exercises are part of Kundalini Yoga, but again, the text focuses on deity possession for chakra movement in Tibetan meditation.

* The passage states ""The program was initiated by singer Sanju Sharma, followed by Jay Shankar Chudhari who presented a chhappan bhog bhajan.""  This means Jay Shankar Chudhari performed the second devotional song (chhappan bhog bhajan).
* Sanju Sharma started the program, so they were first.
*  Laka Sing presented a bhajan *later* in the program.
* Raju Kandewal accompanied other singers, but didn't perform a bhajan solo second."
በምንባቡ መሰረት በምግብ ልገሳው ወቅት የአምልኮ መዝሙሩን ያቀረበው ማነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ላካ ሲንግ**.

The text states: ""108 የሻፓንግ ቡሆግ (in Hinduism 56 different eatables, such as, sweets, fruits, nuts, complete meals etc. offered to Gods) were presented to बाबा श्याम. **Laka Singh** also presented a chhappan bhog bhajan."" 

Therefore, Laka Singh presented the bhajan during the food offering."
የምሽቱ ሁለትኛ-የመጨረሻው ትርዒት ምን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **B: ፋየር ኦፍ አናቶልያ (Fire of Anatolia)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""To conclude, the Fire of Anatolia dance group presented a show titled 'Troy'.""  This means the Fire of Anatolia performance was the final act of the evening.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሰዘን አክሱ፣ አሌሳንድሮ ሳፊና እና ሃሪስ አሌክሱ** - These performers appeared *before* the final act.
*   **C: ዊርሊንግ ደርቪሽስ (Whirling Dervishes)** - This was earlier in the program.
*   **D: ፌይዝ ኤርኮክ እና ሙስሉም ጉርሴስ (Fayti Haykoc and Muslim Gürses)** - They performed even earlier in the show."
የአሌሳድሮ ሳፊና ዜግነት ምን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **D: ጣሊያናዊ (Italian)**.

The text states: ""ቱርካዊዋ ታዋቂ ስዘን አክሱ ከጣሊያናዊው ቴኖር አሌሳንድሮ ሳፊና..."" which translates to ""The famous Turkish singer Sezen Aksu performed with the Italian tenor Alessandro Safina..."""
በምንባቡ መሰረት ከሚከተሉት መግለጫዎች ውስጥ ትክክል ያልሆነው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ሳንታ ክላራ ውስጥ እሳት ነበር** (Santa Clara had a fire).

Here's why:

* **The passage states Captain Scott Counsell said it was a hot day in Santa Clara, not that there was a fire.** He specifically mentions the temperature being in the 90s.
* **B: ሰዎች ከሮለር ኮስተር ላይ መውጫ አጥተው ነበር** (People were stuck on a roller coaster) - This is true, as the text mentions people were stuck on the roller coaster for at least an hour.
* **C: ተሳፋሪዎች ውሃ ተሰጥቷቸው ነበር** (Passengers were given water) - This is true, the first sentence explicitly states water was given to passengers.
* **D: የመጀመሪያውን ሰው ለማውረድ ቢያንስ 60 ደቂቃዎችን ወስዷል** (It took at least 60 minutes to get the first person off) - This is also true, as the text says it took ""at least an hour.""

Therefore, the only statement *not* supported by the passage is that there was a fire in Santa Clara."
በምንባቡ መሰረት የማይመች የሙቀት ደረጃን በተመለከተ ማን አስተያየት ሰጥቷል?,"The correct answer is **B: የእሳት ካፕቴኑ**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states, ""Fire Captain Scott Couns said 'It was a hot day in Santa Clara, with temperatures in the 90s.'"" This directly indicates that the fire captain provided commentary on the uncomfortable heat level.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የራይድ ኦፐሬተሩ (The Ride Operator):** The text doesn't mention any statements from the ride operator about the temperature.
*   **C: ተሳፋሪዎች (The Passengers):** While the passengers *experienced* the heat, the text doesn't quote any of them commenting on it. It just states they were given water while waiting.
*   **D: የፖሊስ ቺፉ (The Police Chief):** There is no mention of a police chief in the text.

በሱናሚ እንቅስቃሴው ምክንያት የኃይል እትረጥ የተከሰተው የት ነበር?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

The text specifically states: ""in Tonga there was a temporary power outage..."" which prevented authorities from receiving tsunami warnings. The other options are mentioned in the text but are not where the power outage occurred."
በምንባቡ መሰረት የኃይል እትረቱ በቶንጋ ላይ ያሳደረው ተጽዕኖ እንዴት ነበር?,"The correct answer is **B: ባለስልጣናት የተነሱትን ማስጠንቀቂያዎች በተመለከተ ዜና አልደረሳቸውም**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""ቢሆንም ግን ለጊዜው ኃይል ጠፍቶ ነብር፣ ይህም ደግሞ የቶንጋ ባለሥልጣናት በ PTWC የተሰጠውን የሱናሚ ማስጠንቀቂያ እንዳያገኙ እንዳደረጋቸው ተገልጿል።"" This translates to: ""However, a temporary power outage occurred, which prevented Tongan authorities from receiving the tsunami warning issued by the PTWC.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: የተወሰነ ጉዳት እንደነበር ሪፖርት ተደርጓል (Some damage was reported):** The passage says there was *no significant damage or injuries* reported.
* **C: የባህር ወለል ንባብ ተጽዕኖ ደርሶበት ነበር (The sea level readings were affected):** While sea level readings *indicated* a tsunami, this isn’t the impact of the power outage *on Tonga*.
* **D: ባለስልጣናት አስፈላጊዎቹ ማስጠንቀቂያዎች አልደረሳቸውን ነበር (Authorities did not receive the necessary warnings):** While true, this is a *result* of the power outage, and option B is the more direct answer to the question of how the power outage affected Tonga.

ፖሊሶቹ የጆኒ ሪድን የአነዳድ ፍጥነት ለመለካት ራዳራቸውን መጠቀም የቻሉት መቼ ነበር?,"The correct answer is **A: በ 160 ኪሜ/ሰ እየነዳ እያለ**.

The text states: ""ፖሊሱ የአቶ ሪድ ፍጥነትን ማግኘት የቻሉት ፍጥነቱን ወደ 160 ኪሜ/ሰ ሲቀንስ ነው።"" This directly means they were able to measure his speed when he was going 160 km/h."
በምንባቡ መሰረት ለኒው ዚላንድ ፖሊስ የጆኒ ሪድን ፍጥነት ለመለካት የከበዳቸው ለምን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **A: ከ 160 ክሜ/ሰ በታች እየነዳ ነበር**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""የኒው ዚላንድ ፖሊስ ብላክ ቢዩቲ ረጅም ስለነበረ አቶ ሪድ በምን ያህል ፍጥነት የፍጥነት ራዳር ሽጉጣቸውን ለመጠቀም እየተቸገሩ ነበር፣ እና ፖሊሱ የአቶ ሪድ ፍጥነትን ማግኘት የቻሉት ፍጥነቱን ወደ 160 ኪሜ/ሰ ሲቀንስ ነው።""

This directly explains that the police had difficulty measuring his speed because he was driving *below* 160 km/h when they could finally get a reading.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: መኪናው በጣም ዝግ ያለ ነበር** - The passage doesn't mention anything about the car being slow.
*   **C: በድልድዩ ላይ ሰባት ጊዜ ብቻ ነው የነዳው** - The number of times he drove over the bridge doesn't affect the police's ability to measure his speed.
*   **D: የኦክላንድ ሃርበር ድልድይ በጣም ያረጀ ነው** - The passage doesn't state the bridge's age as a reason for the difficulty."
ከቡቴ አንጻር የመሬት መንቀጥቀጡ ያተኮረው የት ነበር?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 ማይሎች በስተደቡብ**.

The passage states: ""ከቡቴ በስተደቡብ ደግሞ 65 ኪ.ሜ (40 ማይል) ያህል ነበር።"" which translates to ""It was about 65 km (40 miles) south of Butte."""
በአቡጊራብ አመጽ ወቅት ምን ተፈጠረ?,"The correct answer is **D: እስር ቤቱ በእሳት ተያያዘ**.

The passage explicitly states: ""የኢራቅ አቡ ግህራኢብ እስር ቤት በአመጹ ወቅት እሳት ተቃጥሏል።"" (The Iraqi Abu Ghraib prison was engulfed in flames during the riot.)

While the passage also mentions abuse and US control, the question specifically asks what *happened during the riot* itself, and the fire is what's described as occurring then.
"
የኢራቅ እስር ቤት ታዋቂነት ያገኘው ለምን ነበር? ,"The correct answer is **D: የእስረኛ በደል መኖሩ ሲታወቅ** (Because prisoner abuse became known).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the prison ""gained notoriety after abuse of detainees by US forces came to light.""  The fire and US control are background information, but the *reason* it became infamous was the abuse.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: በእሳት ስለተያያዘ** (Because it caught fire) - The fire was an event *during* the uprising, not the reason for the prison's fame.
* **B: የዩናይትድ ስቴትስ ኃይሎች ተቆጣጠሩት** (US forces took control of it) -  Control by US forces is a fact, but not what made it notorious.
* **C: ብዙ አመጾች ነበሩ** (There were many riots) - The passage mentions an uprising, but it's the *aftermath* – the abuse – that caused the notoriety.

በማኡ ጦርነት መታሰቢያ ስታዲየም ላይ ምን ዓይነት ዝግጅት ይካሄድ ነበር?,"The correct answer is **C: ኮንሰርት**.

Here's why:

The text states ""በSeptember 20 ቀን የነበረውን የሙዚቃ ድግስ ሲሰርዙ"" which translates to ""cancelling the music festival on September 20th"".  A music festival is a type of concert.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የአስማት ትርዒት (Magic show):** The text doesn't mention a magic show.
*   **B: የእግር ኳስ ግጥሚያ (Soccer match):** The text doesn't mention a soccer match; it specifies a stadium, but not its usual purpose.
*   **D: መዋጮ (Fundraising event):** While a concert *could* be a fundraising event, the text specifically identifies it as a music festival/concert."
የክስተቱን መሰረዝ በተመለከተ ማብራሪያ የሰጠው ማን ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: የአስተዳደር ኩባንያው (The management company)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""HK Management Inc., the organization managing the music band, provided a reason the next day that it was due to logistical reasons."" This directly indicates that the management company was the one who explained the cancellation.

The passage states: ""በርካታ የቢሽከክ ነዋሪዎች የደቡብ ሰላማዊ ሰልፈኞችን ህግ ባለማክበራቸው ወቅሰዋቸዋል።"" This directly translates to ""Many Bishkek residents blamed the southern demonstrators for not respecting the law.""  The context links these demonstrators (often described as protestors/opponents) to the looting.



"
ከደቡብ የሆኑት ተቃዋሚዎች ለዘረፋው ተጠያቂ ያደረጉት ማንን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **A: የቢሽኬክ ነዋሪዎች**.

The text states: "" በርካታ የቢሽከክ ነዋሪዎች የደቡብ ሰላማዊ ሰልፈኞችን ህግ ባለማክበራቸው ወቅሰዋቸዋል።"" This directly translates to ""Several Bishkek residents blamed the southern protesters for not upholding the law.""  Therefore, the Bishkek residents blamed the southern protesters for the situation.



"
የሪንግ ተሞክሮ ሽያጮችን የጨመረው መቼ ነበር?,"The correct answer is **A: በሻርክ ታንክ ላይ ከታየ በኋላ**.

The text explicitly states: ""ሽያጭ እንደጨመረ ሲሚኖፍ ተነግሯል። በ2013 በሻርክ ታንክ ምዕራፍ ላይ ከቀረበ ወዲህ..."" This directly links the increase in sales to the appearance on Shark Tank.

Here's why:

The text states Jamie Siminoff realized his own doorbell didn't work well. This prompted him to start the company. The other options are related to *after* the company was already started:

*   **B:** Shark Tank was a point where he *presented* the company, not when he *started* it.
*   **C:** Funding came later, after the idea.
*   **D:** There is no mention of QCV in the text.

እያንዳንዱ የሪዲንግ ሬይንቦው ክፍል ለልጆች ያቀረበው ምክር ምን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **D: መጽሐፎች**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Each show offers book recommendations for children to read when they go to the library."" This directly indicates that each episode provided advice *about books*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የቴሌቪዥን ፕሮግራሞች** - The show *is* a television program, but it's not what it was recommending.
*   **B: አካባቢያዊ ላይብረሪዎች** - The library is *where* the children would use the recommendations, but not the recommendation itself.
*   **C: ገጽታዎች** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
የሪዲንግ ሬይንቦው ተከታታይ ፕሮግራም እንዲሰረዝ ተሳትፎ የነበረው ምን ሊሆን ይችላል?,"The correct answer is **A: በቂ ያልሆነ ፈንድ (Insufficient funding)**.

The passage explicitly states that people, including John Grant, believed the cancellation of the show was a sign of ""a shift in thinking about educational television and a lack of funding."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: የኤሚ አዋርድ ሽልማት አለማግኘት (Failure to win an Emmy Award):** The passage states the program *has* won over two dozen Emmys, so this isn't the reason for cancellation.
* **C: የጆን ግራንት ሀሳብ (John Grant's idea):** The passage presents John Grant as a supporter of the show, not someone who wanted it cancelled.
* **D: የሚስተር ሮጀርስ ሰፈር ስኬት (Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood success):** While the passage compares the show's airtime to Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, it doesn’t suggest the latter's success led to the former's cancellation.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the tree is at risk of falling due to fungus.** This aligns with options C (infected with fungus) and D (dangerous to public health – as falling could cause harm). It also explains why officials wanted to cut it down.
* **The passage explicitly mentions the debate is about whether to *cut down* the tree.** The emergency court decision *prevented* the cutting down, implying the tree *might not* fall immediately.  The officials' concern isn't that the fall is inevitable, but that it's a potential risk they need to manage.
* **Option B (it should be felled) is the core of the dispute.** The museum and city wanted to fell the tree, and the court temporarily stopped them.

Therefore, the disagreement wasn't about *if* it would eventually fall, but *when* and *how* to deal with the risk.

በ RSPCA ዋና መርማሪ መሰረት ምርመራዎች ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ ለየትኛው መደበኛ መሆን አለባቸው?,"The correct answer is **D: የእንስሳት ማረጃ ቦታዎች**.

Here's why:

The text states David O'Shane said ""monitoring and investigations of **slaughterhouses** should become commonplace in Australia."" This directly refers to places where animals are slaughtered, which are also referred to as animal slaughtering facilities. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ለ CCTV ካሜራዎች** - While CCTV is *used* for monitoring, the focus of his statement isn't CCTV itself becoming commonplace, but the investigations of slaughterhouses.
*   **B: ከእንስሳ ጋር ለሚሰራ ማንኛውም ሰው** - His statement is specifically about the places where animals are processed, not all people who work with animals.
*   **C: የመከታተያ ተገጣሚ መሳሪያዎች** - The text only mentions CCTV, not other surveillance tools.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the RSPCA is pushing for CCTV cameras in all Australian slaughterhouses. David O'Shannessy believes CCTV ""will send a strong signal that those working with animals have their welfare as a priority."" This directly links CCTV cameras to reinforcing the importance of animal welfare for workers in the industry.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ከ RSPCA ጋር አስገዳጅ ስብሰባዎችን ማድረግ (Mandatory meetings with the RSPCA):** The passage doesn’t mention mandatory meetings.
*   **C: መደበኛ የእንስሳት እርድ ቦታዎች ግምገማ (Regular inspections of slaughterhouses):** While inspections are implied as something CCTV will *facilitate*, the passage focuses specifically on the cameras themselves as the key factor.
*   **D: ከ ABC የሚደረግ ቁጥጥር (Oversight from the ABC):** The ABC is mentioned as a news outlet reporting on the story, not as a body providing oversight.

The text states: ""P: ... ከዘጠኙ ሰለባዎች መካከል ሦስቱ በቀብር ሥነ ሥርዓት ላይ..."" 

This directly answers the question of how many victims were having a funeral service while news of another arrest was spreading."

Here's why:

The text states that ""in Poland, large protests took place after the country signed the ACTA agreement, leading the Polish government to temporarily halt ratification of the agreement."" This directly indicates that Poland responded to protests by *not* proceeding with the ACTA agreement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ጀርመን** - Germany had protests, but the text doesn't say they halted the agreement.
*   **C: ስኮትላንድ** - Scotland had protests, but as part of the UK, it wasn't a signatory to ACTA.
*   **D: ሊቱዋኒያ** - Lithuania had protests, but the text doesn't state they halted the agreement.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""ሁለቱም ላትቪኣ እና ስሎቫኪያ ኤሲቲኤን የመቀላቀል ሂደታቸውን አዘግይተውታል።"" (Both Latvia and Slovakia have delayed their accession processes to ACTA.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Estonia** - The text mentions protests in Estonia, but not a delay in joining ACTA.
*   **B: Lithuania** - The text mentions protests in Lithuania, but not a delay in joining ACTA.
*   **C: Scotland** - Scotland is part of the United Kingdom, and the text only mentions protests there, not a decision regarding ACTA."
iPod ከልክ በላይ በመሞቁ ምክንያት ምን ያህል ሰዎች ተጎድተዋል?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The passage states that ""four people sustained minor burns"" due to the six fires caused by overheating iPods. While other numbers are mentioned (60 reports, 27 accidents, 34 additional overheating events), the question specifically asks about *people harmed* by overheating, and only four were burned."

Here's why:

The passage directly quotes Steve Jobs saying, ""እኛም በዛሬው ዕለት ታሪክ እንሰራለን"" (""We will make history today""). He stated Apple might *make* history by reinventing the phone. The question asks what he said Apple would recreate, and the answer is history (in the sense of *making* history).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ስልኩን (the phone):** While he *introduced* a phone, he didn't say Apple would recreate the phone itself. He said they'd recreate how phones were thought about.
*   **C: ኩባኒያው (Cuban):** This is irrelevant to the passage.
*   **D: ቴክኖሎጂ (technology):** This is too broad. While the iPhone *is* technology, his specific statement was about making history, not just advancing technology.

የቲቭ ጆብስ የሁለት ሰዓታት ንግግር አላማ ምን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **C: አዲስ ስልክ ስለ መልቀቅ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone and said, ""Today Apple is reinventing the phone, and today we are making history."" This directly indicates his speech was about launching a new phone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: አዲስ ታብሌት ስለ መልቀቅ** - The passage doesn't mention a tablet.
*   **B: አዲስ ኮምፒዩተር ስለ መልቀቅ** - The passage focuses on a phone, not a computer.
*   **D: ጡረታ መውጣቱን ስለማሳወቅ** - The passage does not mention anything about retirement."

The passage states that she announced her plan to run for president at the same location where she launched her 2005 campaign. The campaign she launched in 2005 was for a Senate seat *in* Buenos Aires, but the announcement *at that location* was about her presidential ambitions.

Here's why:

* The passage states she announced her candidacy ""in La Plata, a city 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires"" at a theater.
* Option A accurately reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage doesn't mention a specific theater named ""Buenos Aires Theater.""
* **C:** It states the theater is *near* La Plata, not Buenos Aires.
* **D:** It states the theater is *near* La Plata, not *in* Buenos Aires.

ቢግ ብራዘርን በተመለከተ ACMA የደረሰበት ነገር ምን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **A: የሳንሱር ህጎች አለመጣሳቸውን** (They haven't violated censorship rules).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states ACMA said Big Brother Media *had not* violated online content censorship rules because the video wasn't hosted on the Big Brother website itself. The other options are incorrect based on the information provided:

* **B:** The text says it *wasn't* hosted on the website.
* **C:** ACMA said they *didn't* violate the rules.
* **D:** The text explains that physical server presence is required for the Broadcasting Services Act to apply to internet content.  The video not being on their server is *why* ACMA ruled they hadn't violated the rules.

አንድ ሚዲያ የበይነመረብ ይዘት ተደርጎ እንዲቆጠር ምን አይነት ልኬት ውስጥ መስፈር አለበት?,"The correct answer is **B: በአገልጋዩ ላይ በአካል የሚኖር መሆን አለበት**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...እንደ በይነመረብ ይዘት ይቆጠራል, በሰርቨር ላይ በአካል መኖር አለበት."" This means that, according to the broadcasting law described, content needs to be physically hosted on a server to be considered internet content.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በበይነመረብ ላይ መለቀቅ አለበት** - While being released online is part of the process, it’s not enough. The passage specifies *where* it needs to be.
*   **C: በድር ጣቢያ ላይ መከማቸት የለበትም** - The passage actually discusses a case *because* the content wasn't stored on Big Brother's website.
*   **D: በ ACMA መጽደቅ አለበት** - The passage doesn't mention ACMA approval as a requirement for content to be considered internet content."
የአውስትራሊያ ሊበራል ፓርቲ መሪ ማን ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: ጆን ሆዋርድ**.

The text states that Peter Costello believes he could replace Prime Minister **John Howard**. This implies John Howard is currently the Prime Minister (and thus the leader of the Liberal Party). 

The text does *not* state that Peter Costello is the leader of the Liberal Party, only that he *could* replace the current leader.

አውስትራሊያ ቀድሞውኑ የኒውክለር ኃይል ኢንዱስትሪ የሌላት ለምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: የህዝብ ድጋፍ እጥረት (Lack of public support)**.

Here's why:

The text states Peter Costello believes Australia *should* use nuclear power *if* it becomes economically viable and *if* there isn't internal opposition. This implies that a current barrier is indeed a form of opposition - which is most likely public opinion. The passage doesn't mention the technology being too dangerous or expensive (D), and it doesn't suggest the issue was simply contentious (B) without identifying the root of that contention.  It focuses on the *principle* of opposition, which is best represented by a lack of public support.

በመመሪያ እገዛ የተወዳደረው በረዶ ተንሸራታች ማን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **A: አና ጆክምሴን**.

The text states: "" እነሱ፣ አና ጆቼምሰን ሱፐር-ጂ ውስጥ የሴቶች ቋሚ ክፍል ውስጥ ዘጠነኛ በመጨረሷ ኔዘርላንድስን..."" This indicates Ana Jochemsen competed in the women's standing Super-G. The question asks for a skier who competed with guidance, and while not explicitly stated, athletes in the ""standing"" category often use guides.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ጆንግ ሲዎርክ ፓርክ** competed in the men's seated Super-G.
*   **C: ማሲዬጅ ክሬዜል** and **D: አና ኦጋርዚንስካ** are both Polish male skiers who competed in Super-G, but there is no mention of them needing guidance."
በሱፐር-ጂ የሴቶች የቁም ክፍል አስረኛ ሆና ያጠናቀቀችው ሀገር ማናት?,"The correct answer is **A: ፊንላንድ**.

The passage states: ""ካትጃ ሳሪነን በተመሳሳይ ዝግጅት አስረኛ በመጨረሷ ፊንላድን"". This directly answers the question."

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states ብሌክም (Black) **ውድቅ በማድረጉ (denied) ጥቃቱን** (the assault). He did *not* plead guilty.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: ትዕይንቱ ላይ ታሰረ (He was arrested at the scene)** - The passage implies this by saying he was in custody during the hearing.
*   **C: በጥቃቱ ወቅት ፖል ተጠቅሟል (He used pepper spray during the assault)** - The text mentions he used pepper spray to defend himself ""from a barrage of bottles"".
*   **D: ብርጭቆዎች እንደተወረወሩበት ተናግሯል (He said bottles were being thrown)** - The passage states the situation involved ""bottles being thrown at him from a crowd of thirty people.""

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""ብሌክም የፍትሕ ሂደትን በማዛባት ሙከራ ተወንጅሏል።"" (Black was accused of attempting to pervert the course of justice.) - This confirms **A** is true.
*   **The passage states:** ""ዳኛው ለብሌክ ወደ እስር ቤት መወሰዱ “የማይቀር ነገር” ነው ሲል ተናግሮታል።"" (The judge stated that Black being sent to prison was “inevitable.”) - This confirms **B** and **D** are true, as he was effectively sentenced to prison.
*   **The passage does NOT mention** any sexual assault against Black. It only states he used a blanket to shield himself.

Therefore, **C** is the only option not mentioned or implied in the provided text."
የተመድ የአለም ሙቀት መጨመር ፈንድ ጥቅም ላይ የማይውለው ለየትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: ቴክኖሎጂን ወደ በማደግ ላይ ያሉ አገራት ማምጣት**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the fund will help developing nations grow with lower emissions *by sharing innovation*.** This implies sharing technology is a *method* to achieve that goal, not a direct use of the fund itself. The fund is used for things *like* flood defenses and improving water management, which *facilitate* that sharing.

Let's look at why the other options are correct uses of the fund, as stated in the passage:

* **A: ሰብሎችን ብዙ አይነት ለማድረግ (To diversify crops)** - The passage says money could go towards ""crop diversification.""
* **C: ጎርፍ የማይጎዳቸው ቤቶች (Flood-proof homes)** - The passage explicitly mentions ""flood defenses.""
* **D: የአለም ሙቀት መጨመር የሚያመጣውን ተጽዕኖ ማቅለል (To lessen the impact of climate change)** - This is the overall goal and the fund is aimed at helping countries ""cope with the impacts"" of climate change.

Here's why:

* The passage states the UN hopes to raise **money** to help countries impacted by climate change.
* It also mentions helping developing nations grow with lower emissions by **sharing innovation** (technology).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ሰብሎች (Crops):** While the passage mentions crop diversification, the UN isn't *saving* crops, but rather using them as part of a larger strategy.
* **C: ቀሪ የዝናብ ደኖች (Remaining rainforests):** The passage mentions saving ""the world's remaining forests,"" but this isn't the primary focus of the UN's efforts as described in the text.
* **D: በደካማ የውሃ አስተዳደር የተጎዱ ሰዎች (People affected by poor water management):**  The passage mentions improved water management as a *use* of the funds, not what the UN is trying to *save*.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Commissioner Muchanga said, ""“…even though we haven’t yet agreed on the rules of origin and **tariff concessions**, the framework we have is sufficient to start trading by July 1, 2020.” 

This directly indicates that agreement on tariff concessions is still needed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በርሊን AfCTA ብትቀላቀል** - Berlin is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: ንግዱ የሚጀምርበት ቀን** - The passage states a date (July 1, 2020) is already set for the start of trade.
*   **C: የመነሻ ደንቦች** - Although rules of origin are mentioned alongside tariff concessions, the question asks specifically what Muchanga identified as needing further agreement. Tariff concessions are the clearer answer.

Here's why:

The passage states: *""ኮሚሽነሮሩ እንዳሉት፣ """"በሕጎቹ አጀማመርና በታሪፍ አነሳስ ላይ ስምምነት ላይ እስካሁን ያልደረስን ቢሆንም ያለን ማዕቀፍ በቂ ስለሆነ ንግዱን በJuly 1, 2020 መጀመር ይቻላል""""*.""*

This directly indicates that despite the lack of full agreement on rules and tariff concessions, the *existing framework* is sufficient to start trade on July 1st.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage says Nigeria *plans* to join, it doesn't state their agreement is the reason for the July start date.
*   **C:** While the Commissioner announced it, his approval isn't the *reason* trade can begin.
*   **D:** The passage explicitly states they *haven't* reached an agreement on these things yet.

Here's why:

The passage states the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's report showed the test scores increased ""despite problems within the system that were known.""  It then states the system didn't take action on these known issues. This is the core of the newspaper's findings that led to the accusations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የጋዜጣ-ህገ መንግስት ሪፖርትን መነካካት** - The newspaper *published* a report, it wasn't accused of tampering with it.
*   **B: የከተማ ትምህርትን ማሻሻል አለመቻል** - While improvement was initially celebrated, the issue wasn't a failure to improve, but rather *how* the improvement was achieved (through cheating).
*   **D: ዝቅተኛ የፈተና ነጥቦችን ሪፖርት ማድረግ** - The report focused on the *unusual increase* in scores, not low scores.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states that official reports confirmed up to 30 people were injured and the official death toll reached eight, but the final numbers were still unknown. This focuses on the *known* official death count at the time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: የመጨረሻው የተጎጂ ቁጥር** - The passage explicitly says the final numbers are *not* known yet.
* **B: ቦምቦቹ የፈነዱት በየትኞቹ ህንጻዎች አቅራቢያ ነው** - It states they were near government buildings and the General's office, but doesn't detail *which* specific buildings.
* **C: ተጨማሪ ቦምቦች የሚፈነዱ መሆኑ** - The passage states three *additional* bombs exploded, meaning this was already known to be happening, not information discovered *after* the first explosion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: እንግዳዎቹ መካ የነበሩት ለሀይማኖታዊ ጉዞ ነበር** - While true, the passage specifies it's *in preparation* for Hajj, making option C more precise.
* **B: አንዳንድ እንግዶች የአካባቢው ዜጎች አልነበሩም** - The passage states they were *mostly* from the UAE, but doesn't exclude the possibility of others.

* The other options are mentioned with more certainty in the passage:
    * **B: የግጭቱ ቦታ** - The passage clearly states the collision occurred 491 miles above Earth.
    * **C: ግጭቱ በመሬት ላይ የነበረው ተጽዕኖ** - Scientists are investigating this, but the passage acknowledges an impact *exists* and is being studied.
    * **D: የፍርስራሾቹ ቦታ** - The passage states the US Strategic Command is *collecting* the debris, implying its location is known and being addressed.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""scientists are working to determine how big the collision was and how it might impact Earth."" This directly indicates that the *size/magnitude* of the collision is still unknown and being investigated.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የፍርስራሽ ክትትሉን ማን እንደሚሰራ** - The passage explicitly states the US Strategic Command is removing debris.
*   **B: ግጭቱ በተከሰተበት ጊዜ ሳተላይቶቹ በምን ያህል ፍጥነት እየተጓዙ እንደ ነበር** - The passage states they were traveling around 17,500 mph, so the speed is known.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states the law applies to video games *sold in California*. It doesn't mention or attempt to regulate sales to minors outside of the state.
*   Option A is accurate - the law *does* restrict sales/rentals to minors in California.
*   Option B is accurate - there *is* a monetary fine for violations.

The text states: ""ደስቲን “ጎልደስት” ረነልስ በሰጡት አስተያየት “ሉና እንደ እኔ በጣም እብድ ነበረች…"".  ""እብድ"" is a translation of ""freaky.""

በአደጋው ​​የተሳተፈው ሹፌር ላይ ምን አልደረሰም?,"The correct answer is **A: የጭንቅላት ጉዳት ደርሶበታል** (He/She suffered a head injury).

The text explicitly states: ""ሆኖም አሽከርካሪው በጭንቅላቱ ላይ ከባድ የአካል ጉዳት ደርሶበታል"" (However, the driver suffered a serious head injury).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: በቤቱ ውስጥ ካሉት ሰዎች መካከል የትኛውም ላይ ጉዳት አላደረሰም** (None of the people in the house were injured) - This is true, but the question asks what happened *to the driver*.
* **C: በካምብሪጅ ከሚገኝ ሆስፒታል ወደ ግሬት ያርማውዝ ተዛወረ** (Was transferred from a hospital in Cambridge to Great Yarmouth) - This is the opposite of what happened. He was transferred *to* Cambridge.
* **D: የአደጋ ጊዜ አገልግሎት ከተሽከርካሪው ለማስወገድ ረድተዋል** (Emergency services helped to remove him from the vehicle) - This is true, but doesn't describe what happened *to* the driver, just what happened *during* the rescue.

በራግቢ ​​ውድድር ወቅት በደቡብ አፍሪካ የጨዋታ ላይ የተለየ ነገር ያልነበረው ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: በውድድሩ መጀመሪያ ላይ ያማረ አፈጻጸም** (Started poorly in the competition).

Here's why:

The passage states that South Africa *started* slowly and improved as the competition went on: ""ደቡብ አፍሪካ ቀስ በቀስ ውድድሩ በቀጠለ ቁጥር አሻሻለች"" (South Africa gradually improved as the competition progressed). This means their performance wasn't strong from the beginning - they didn't have a great start.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: አስደናቂ የቡድን ስራ (Amazing teamwork)** - The passage *highlights* their teamwork as a strength, it wasn't something they lacked.
*   **B: የኳስ አያያዝ ችሎታ (Ball handling skills)** - The passage *highlights* their ball handling skills as a strength.
*   **D: የመከላከል ክህሎቶች (Defensive skills)** - The passage *highlights* their defensive skills as a strength.

Therefore, the only thing that wasn't consistently strong for South Africa was their initial performance in the competition."
በምንባቡ መሰረት የደቡብ አፍሪካ ጨዋታ መቼ መሻሻል ጀመረ?,"The correct answer is **D: ውድድሩ እንደቀጠለ ሲሄድ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ደቡብ አፍሪካ ቀስ በቀስ ውድድሩ በቀጠለ ቁጥር አሻሻለች"" which translates to ""South Africa gradually improved as the competition continued."" This directly indicates their game improved *as* the competition progressed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ከቀኑ 10፡00 ሰዓት አካባቢ** - The games started at 10:00, but the passage doesn't say their performance was good *at* that time.
*   **B: ተከላካዩን ካጠናከረ በኋላ** - The passage mentions their defense was strong, but doesn't link improvement *to* strengthening it.
*   **C: በዛምቢያ ከተሸነፈ በኋላ** - They *won* against Zambia, they didn't lose.

በምንባቡ መሠረት ከሚከተሉት መግለጫዎች ውስጥ የቻይናን ኢኮኖሚ በትክክል የማያንጸባርቅ የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: ቻይና ከጀርመን የበለጠ መኪና ወደ ውጭ ልካ አታውቅም**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ለመጀመሪያ ጊዜ፣ የዛሬ አመት መኪናን ወደ ውጭ ሀገር በይበልጥ በመላክ ቻይና ጀርመን የበለጠች"" which translates to ""For the first time, this year China surpassed Germany in exporting cars.""

Therefore, option D directly contradicts the information provided in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: ማሻሻያ ካደረገች በኋላ የቻይና ኢኮኖሚ በከፍተኛ ደረጃ አድጓል** - The passage mentions the economy grew 90 times after the reforms, supporting this statement.
*   **B: ቻይና መኪና ወደ ውጪ በመላክ ከሰሜን አሜሪካ የበለጠ ገበያ አላት** - The passage states China surpassed the US in car exports, meaning it has a larger market than the US.
*   **C: ቻይና በጊዜ ሂደት ከሰሜን አሜሪካ የበለጠ ትልቅ ጂዲፒ ሊኖራት ይችላል** - The passage suggests China's GDP could double that of the US within two decades.



"
በምንባቡ መሠረት የቻይና ጂዲፒ መቼ ከዩሰሜን አሜሪካ ሊበልጥ ይችላል?,"The correct answer is **B: በሁለት አስርት ዓመታት ውስጥ**.

The passage explicitly states: ""የቻይና ጂዲፒ ከዩናይትድ ስቴትስ ጂዲፒ በሁለት አስር አመታቶች መብለጥ ይችላል።"" (Which translates to: ""China's GDP may surpass that of the United States in two decades."")

Here's why:

The text states ሑ ታዳጊ ሀገሮች “ውሀን አሁን በክሎ በኋላ የማጥራት መንገድን እንዲተዉ” አበረታተ። This directly translates to encouraging developing countries to abandon outdated pollution methods (like the chlorine water purification method mentioned).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የእድገታቸውን ደረጃ የሚገፋፉ ግዴታዎችን እንዲወስዱ** - The text specifically states they *shouldn't* be asked to take on responsibilities beyond their level of development.
*   **B: በኢኮኖሚያዊ ውጤቶች ላይ እንዲያተኩሩ** - The text doesn't mention economic outcomes as the focus of the suggestion.
*   **C: አሁን ካለባቸው ኃላፊነት አልፈው እንዲሄዱ** - The text argues *against* asking them to go beyond their existing responsibilities.

Here's why:

* **P** discusses a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions *relative to 2005 levels by 2020*, but it doesn't state a final cutoff date for emissions. It focuses on the *amount* of reduction.
* **A: የቅነሳ መሠረት** is mentioned - the base year is 2005.
* **B: ብክለትን በተመለከተ ለታዳጊ ሀገራት የተሰጠ ምክር** is explicitly stated (""ውሀን አሁን በክሎ በኋላ የማጥራት መንገድን እንዲተዉ” and ""ከእድገታቸው ደረጃ፣ ሀላፊነት እና አቅም ባለፈ ሀላፊነት እንዲወስዱ መጠየቅ የለባቸውም።"").
* **D: የካርቦን ልቀት ቅነሳዎች አሃዝ** is also mentioned - ""ለGDP እያንዳንዱ አሃድ"".

Therefore, the only element *not* discussed in the passage is a specific date when carbon emissions would stop altogether."

Here's why:

Richard Verrman specifically states, ""ሁኔታው በአንጎላ እጅግ በጣም መጥፎ ነው"" (The situation in Angola is very bad). He is directly commenting on the severity of the situation *in* Angola.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሜዲስንስ ሳንስ ፍሮንቲርስ:** He is a spokesperson *for* Médecins Sans Frontières, he's not saying the organization is in bad shape.
*   **C: ማንጎላ:** He mentions Mangola as one of the organizations recognizing the severity, but doesn't comment on its condition.
*   **D: የዓለም ጤና ድርጅት:** Similar to Mangola, he acknowledges the WHO's recognition, but doesn’t comment on the organization itself.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the theater ""encourages people to join in."" This directly refers to joining the performance on stage, coinciding with the hashish being smoked.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በካናቢስ አጠቃቀም ውስጥ እንዲሳተፉ** - While hashish *is* smoked, the passage states the theater encourages people to *join in* the performance, not specifically to use drugs.
*   **B: ወደ ጃፓን ጉዞ እንዲያደርጉ** - The mention of ""Japan"" is related to the theme of the opera, not a direct invitation to travel.
*   **D: ህይወታቸው በሚወዱት ነገር እንዲመራ እንዲፈቅዱ** - This is a philosophical interpretation of the opera's theme, not a direct instruction given by the promoters.

በአቃቤ ህግ ምክንያት የሁንን የካቢኔ ቦታ ማን ይወስዳል?,"The correct answer is **C: አቅራቢዎቹ (The producers)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the producers are the ones distributing hashish on stage and encouraging audience participation.  If there are legal repercussions (as indicated by ""due to the prosecutor""), the producers would be the ones facing the consequences and therefore, the ones to potentially lose their position.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: አርቲስቱ (The artist):** The artist, Camille Saint-Saëns, composed the opera; they aren't directly involved in the controversial on-stage actions.
* **B: የፈረንሳይ ታዳሚዎች (The French audience):** The audience is participating, but they are not the ones *causing* the legal issue.
* **D: ካሚል ሴንት-ሳይንስ (Camille Saint-Saëns):** As the composer, he wouldn't be responsible for the staging choices made much later.

"""ሊዮኖቭ ያከናወነው """"ስፔስዎክ"""" ሌላ ስሙ ማን ይባላል?""","The correct answer is **C: Extravehicular activity**.

The passage states that Leonov performed the ""first ever spacewalk,"" and then clarifies that a spacewalk is also known as an ""extravehicular activity.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Apollo-Soyuz mission:** This was a later mission Leonov *led*, not what the spacewalk itself was called.
*   **B: Space Race:** This is the broader context of the event, not the name of the spacewalk.
*   **D: Cosmonaut No. 11:** This is Leonov's call sign, not the name of the spacewalk.



"
ሊዮኖቭ የመራው የትኛውን የሶቪየትን ክፍል ተልዕኮ ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: አፖሎ-ሶዩዝ**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የጠፈር ውድድሩ** - While the Apollo-Soyuz mission *ended* the space race, Leonov led the *mission* itself, not the race.
*   **C: ኮስሞናውት ቁጥር 11** - This was the name given to Leonov's first group of cosmonauts, not a mission he led.
*   **D: EVA** - EVA (Extravehicular Activity, or spacewalk) is what Leonov *performed* on his first mission; it's not a mission he led."
በአደጋው ​​የተጎዳው ማን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **A: ጊብሰን**.

The text states: ""አደጋው ከተከሰተ በኋላ፣ ጊብሰን ወደ ሆስፒታል ተወሰደ ግን ከዚያ ወዲያው ሞተ።"" (After the accident, Gibson was taken to hospital but died immediately afterwards.) This clearly indicates Gibson was the one harmed in the accident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: የጋራጅ ሰራተኛ** - The garage worker witnessed the accident, but wasn't *injured* by it.
* **C: ልጆች** - The text states the children were upset and crying, but doesn't say they were physically injured.
* **D: የጭነት መኪና ሹፌር** - The text specifically states ""የ 64 ዓመቱ የጭነት መኪና ሾፌር፣ በአደጋው አልተጎዳ።"" (The 64-year-old truck driver was not injured in the accident.)

በአደጋው ​​የተሳተፉት ሰዎች ምን ሆኑ?,"The correct answer is **B: አንዱ ጉዳት አልደረሰበትም አንዱ ሞተ**.

* The text states Gibson was taken to the hospital but died shortly after. (ሞተ)
* The text explicitly says the 64-year-old truck driver was unharmed. (ጉዳት አልደረሰበትም)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ሁለቱም ሞቱ** - This is incorrect because the truck driver was not injured.
* **C: እየጮሁ እና እያለቀሱ ነበር** - This describes the reaction of bystanders, not who was *involved* in the accident.
* **D: ሁለቱም ጉዳት ደርሶባቸዋል** - This is incorrect because the truck driver was unharmed.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the program was designed to *simulate the tidal forces* between the Sagittarius Galaxy and the Milky Way. The scientists were investigating the effects of these forces, mirroring how the Moon's gravity causes tides on Earth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: መደበኛ ቁስ (Normal matter)** - While the passage mentions dark matter behaving *like* normal matter, the simulation wasn't focused on observing normal matter itself.
*   **C: ትናንሽ ቅንጣቶች (Small clumps)** - The passage states the dark matter halo is *made up* of these clumps, but the simulation's main goal was to observe the tidal forces, not the clumps directly.
*   **D: ጨለማ ቁስ (Dark matter)** - The simulation aimed to understand how dark matter *interacts* through tidal forces, not just to observe dark matter existing.

Therefore, the scientists hoped to see the results of **tidal forces** in their simulation."
ሳይንቲስቶች ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ ሲታዘቡ የነበሩት የትኛውን ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: Sagittarius Galaxy and Milky Way**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the scientists were focused on the tidal forces *between* the Sagittarius Galaxy and the Milky Way.  They used the Earth-Moon relationship as an *analogy* to understand these galactic interactions.  Therefore, the primary focus of their consideration was those two galaxies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Milky Way and Moon** - The Moon is used as part of an analogy, not the main focus.
*   **B: Earth and Sagittarius Galaxy** - Earth isn't directly involved in the study described.
*   **C: Earth and Moon** - Again, the Earth-Moon relationship is an analogy, not the central subject."

Here's why:

*   The passage states that criticism focused on *who* was getting rebuilding contracts (""Washington insiders... focused on the awarding of rebuilding contracts""). It doesn't mention criticism of the *amount* of aid being spent, or the cost of rebuilding itself.
*   The passage implies there *was* a rebuilding effort (though it was controversial due to contract awarding), ruling out B.
*   C is exactly what the criticism *was* about, not something untouched by it.
*   D, like C, is related to the controversial aspects of rebuilding, not something free from scrutiny.

Therefore, the only option that wasn't subject to criticism, based on the passage, is the amount of aid/assistance provided."
ለሃሪኬን ካትሪና የእርዳታ ጥረቶች የመልሶ ግንባታ ውሎችን የሚነቅፈው ማነው?,"The correct answer is **D: የዋሽንግተን የውስጥ አዋቂዎች**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that ""Washington insiders"" were focused on profiting from reconstruction contracts after Hurricane Katrina. They were critical of the rebuilding effort and sought to benefit financially from it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የፊስካል ወግ አጥባቂዎች (Fiscal conservatives):** While they might have concerns about spending, the passage doesn’t link them to *profiting* from the contracts.
*   **B: ሊበራሎች (Liberals):** The passage doesn't mention liberals being involved in the contract issues.
*   **C: ቡሽ (Bush):** While the contracts were nicknamed the ""Bush New Orleans deal,"" the passage focuses on the *insiders* taking advantage, not President Bush himself.

Here's why:

The passage states StarDust ""broke the previous record set during the Apollo X command module's return in May 1969"" and that it will create ""a spectacular light show...across the skies of California, Oregon, Nevada and Utah."" This indicates the new record is related to the **extent of the visible light display** across a wide area of the sky.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: በአብዛኛዎቹ ከተሞች ውስጥ መታየት:** While it *will* be seen in many cities, the record isn't about how many cities can see it, but the area of the sky illuminated.
*   **C: ወደ ምድር በፍጥነት መመለስ:** The speed is mentioned, but the record broken isn't solely about speed of re-entry.
*   **D: ከሳን ፍራንሲስኮ ወደ ሎስ አንጀለስ በጣም በፍጥነት መጓዝ:** This is just an example of the capsule's speed, not the record itself.

The text states: ""የ29 ዓመቱ ዶክተር ማላር ባላሱበርሜኒያን ... እናቷ 53 ዓመቱን ሳሮጃ ባላሱብራማኒያን"" which translates to ""The 29-year-old doctor, Malar Balasubramanian... her mother, the 53-year-old Saroja Balasubramanian"". This clearly indicates that Malar is Saroja's daughter."

በ eBay የተገዛው ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

The passage states that eBay saw Skype as its biggest asset and was hoping to expand its revenue streams in areas where Skype had a strong presence (like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil). This directly indicates that eBay bought Skype."
ኢቤይ ከግዢው ምን ለማግኘት ይፈልጋል?,"The correct answer is **B: ወደ አዲስ ግዛቶች መስፋፋት (To expand into new territories)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states eBay hopes to find new revenue sources by capitalizing on Skype's strong position in areas like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil. This directly indicates a desire to expand into these new geographic markets.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: ገቢውን ማጠናከር (Strengthen revenue):** While expanding *can* strengthen revenue, the passage focuses on *where* they'll get that revenue (new territories) rather than simply boosting existing income.
*   **C: መገለጫውን ከፍ ማድረግ (Raise the profile):**  This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **D: ባለአክሲዮኖቹን ማርካት (Satisfy shareholders):** This is a potential outcome of success, but not the direct goal stated in the passage.

Here's why:

* The passage states the injured were taken *to the hospital*. It doesn't mention hospital staff interacting with the remaining prisoners in the yard.
* **Negotiators (A)** attempted to resolve the situation with the prisoners.
* **Officers (C)** entered the yard with riot gear and used tear gas.
* **Firefighters (B)** extinguished the fire in the yard.

Therefore, hospital staff are the only group not mentioned as interacting with the prisoners after the initial removal of the injured."

The passage states that ""አመፅ መሣሪያ የታጠቁ መኮንኖች ወደ ግቢው በመግባት እስረኞችን በአስለቃሽ ጭስ ዘጉ"" and then the fire was eventually extinguished. This implies the tear gas was used to get the prisoners to disperse and end the unrest.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የተሳኩ ድርድሮች** - The passage says negotiators *tried* to resolve the situation, but the prisoners' demands were unclear, suggesting negotiations were not successful.
*   **C: የቆሰሉ እስረኞች** - While the initial fight led to some prisoners being taken to the hospital, it was not this that caused the remaining prisoners to disperse.
*   **D: እሳት** - The fire was a *result* of the unrest, not the cause of it ending.

The passage states that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei described the reliance on oil as a ""plague"" – something Iran needs to free itself from, starting before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የገንዘብ ማእቀቦች (Financial sanctions):** While the passage mentions sanctions, Khamenei's comment wasn't *about* freeing Iran from sanctions, but from oil dependence.
*   **B: የእስልምና አብዮት (Islamic Revolution):** The revolution is the timeframe *before* he made the statement about oil, not what he wants to free Iran from.
*   **C: ከውጭ የሚገኝ ገቢ (Foreign income):** This is a *result* of the oil dependence, not the dependence itself.

The passage states: ""it was the first time high Iranian sources had admitted sanctions were hurting."" This directly indicates that high Iranian sources believe the sanctions are damaging to the Iranian economy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኦፒኢሲ (OPEC):** OPEC reported on oil trade volumes, but the passage doesn't state they *believe* sanctions are hurting Iran's economy. They just provided data.
* **C: አያቶላህ አሊ ካሜኒ (Ayatollah Ali Khamenei):** He described oil dependence as a ""plague,"" but the text doesn't say he believes *sanctions* are the cause of the economic problems. He focuses on the issue of oil dependence itself.
* **D: የአውሮፓ ህብረት (European Union):** The EU is mentioned as enacting sanctions, but not as believing in their negative impact.

    *   ""...ምርጫውን ዝርዝር ይፈርማል።"" (The voter signs the voting list).
    *   ""እጩዎች እያንዳንዱን የሂደቱን ክፍል እንዲታዘቡ ተወካዮችን መላክ ይችላሉ።"" (Candidates can send representatives to observe).
    *   ""ምሽት ላይ ድምፆች የተወሰኑ አሰራሮችን በመከተል በከባድ ቁጥጥር በበጎ ፈቃደኞች ይቆጠራሉ።"" (Votes are counted by volunteers under strict control).

*   **Why the other options are correct:**
    *   **B: በእጩዎች የተላኩ ተወካዮች** - The passage explicitly mentions candidates sending representatives.
    *   **C: የድምጽ መስጫ ወረቀት መፈረም** - The passage states voters sign the voting list.
    *   **D: በእጩ ተወካዮች የተቆጠሩ ድምፆች** - The passage states volunteers count the votes under strict control.

*   **Why A is incorrect:** The passage doesn't mention anything about *clear ballot boxes*. The focus is on the secret ballot process and the careful oversight of the process, not the transparency of the ballot box itself. In fact, the description suggests the opposite, as voters use a booth to maintain secrecy.

Therefore, **A** is the only option that is *not* part of the French voting process as described in the passage."
መራጮች የመረጡትን እጩ የት ያመለክታሉ?,"The correct answer is **B: ቀድሞ በታተመ ወረቀት ላይ**.

The text states: ""መራጮች እራሳቸውን በዳስ ውስጥ ያገለሉ ፣ የመረጡትን እጩ የሚያመለክት **ቀድሞ-የታተመ ወረቀት** ወደ ፖስታ ውስጥ ያስገባሉ።"" This directly answers the question.

አለን የሙሳሺን የስምንት ዓመት ፍለጋ እንዲጀምር ያደረገው ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: በጦርነቱ ላይ ያለው ፍላጎት**.

The text states Allen began the search ""based on his lifelong fascination with the war"" (translated as ""በጦርነቱ ላይ በነበረው የዕድሜ ልክ ፍላጎቱ መሰረት""). While his wealth enabled the search and he used a map, the *reason* he started it was his interest in the war."
በምንባብ መሠረት አለን ከፍተኛ መጠን ያለው ገንዘቡን በምን ላይ አውሏል?,"The correct answer is **B: የባህር ውስጥ ፍለጋ ላይ**.

The passage states that Allen ""has poured much of his fortune into ocean exploration."" This directly answers the question of where he has invested a large amount of his money.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሙሳሺን ወደነበረበት መመለስ ላይ** - While finding the *Musashi* is the goal, the investment is in the *process* of finding it, not returning it to its original state.
*   **C: ROV መገንባት ላይ** - The ROV is a *tool* used in the exploration, not the primary investment.
*   **D: ስለ የባህር ወለል ካርታ አሰራር መማር ላይ** - The map is a guide, but the investment is in the broader exploration effort."

Here's why:

The passage states, ""ፖሊስ እንደሚለው፣ ይህ የሚያሳየው ምናልባት በሥፍራው የነበሩ የዩራኒየም ነዳጅ መያዣ ታንከሮች ተቀደው መፍሰስ ጀምረው እንደነበርነው"" (Police say this suggests that uranium fuel storage tanks at the site may have been damaged and leaking). This directly links the dangerous situation to the uranium fuel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ራዲዮአክቲቭ ሲሲየም (Radioactive cesium):** While radioactive cesium *was detected*, it was a *result* of the problem, not the cause.
*   **C: ነጭ ጭስ (White smoke):** The white smoke is a *symptom* of a problem, but not the *source* of the danger.
*   **D: አዮዲን (Iodine):** Like cesium, radioactive iodine was *detected*, but it was a *result* of the leak, not the initial cause.

በፋብሪካው ላይ የተከሰተውን ክስተት ተከትሎ ለአካባቢው ነዋሪዎች ከተጠቆሙት የደህንነት ምክሮች ውስጥ ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ አንዱ ያልሆነው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ነጭ ጭስ ወደ ውስጥ ከመተንፈስ መቆጠብ**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states residents were advised to **stay indoors**, **turn off air conditioners**, and **not drink tap water**. While the report mentions white smoke, it doesn't state residents were explicitly told to avoid breathing it in. The advice focuses on containment and avoiding ingestion of potentially contaminated substances.

Therefore, option C is the one that wasn't directly mentioned as a safety precaution in the provided text."
ዶ/ር ሞል እንዳሉት፣ ስለ XDR-TB በጣም የሚያሳስበው ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: ከፍተኛ የሞት መጠን አለው**.

Here's why:

The passage directly quotes Dr. Mole as saying the new variant is ""very worrying and frightening because of its extremely high mortality rate."" This is the primary concern she expresses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ቫይረሱ በሆስፒታል ውስጥ መያዙ:** While the passage mentions potential hospital transmission, it's presented as a *result* of the problem, not the main worry itself.
*   **B: የቫይረሱ መድኃኒቶችን የመቋቋም ችሎታ:** The passage states it's a drug-resistant strain (XDR-TB), but Dr. Mole's primary concern is the *outcome* of that resistance – the high death rate.
*   **C: በቫይረሱ ​​የተያዘ ሰው ሊበክለው የሚችለው ሰዎች መጠን:** While concerning, the passage frames the number of people one person can infect as a consequence of the disease, not the core reason for Dr. Mole's fear.



"
ስንት በአዲሱ ቫይረስ የተያዙ ታካሚዎች የጤና አጠባበቅ ሰራተኞች መሆናቸው ተረጋግጧል?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The passage states: ""ዶ/ር ሞል በትንሹ ሁለቱ የሆስፒታል የጤና ሰራተኞች እንደሆኑ ታስባለች"" (Dr. Mole suspects at least two hospital healthcare workers). This directly answers the question."
የ NextGen ስርዓት ምን አይነት ቴክኖሎጂ ይጠቀማል?,"The correct answer is **A: በሳተላይት ላይ የተመሰረተ ቴክኖሎጂ**.

The passage explicitly states that NextGen uses ""በሳተላይት ላይ የተመሰረተ ቴክኖሎጂ"" to improve air traffic control. The other options are either too general (B), describe something the system *achieves* (D), or represent the old technology it *replaces* (C)."
NextGen የአየር ትራፊክ ተቆጣጣሪዎችን እንዴት በቀጥታ ይጠቀማል?,"The correct answer is **B: የበለጠ ትክክለኛ የአውሮፕላን ቦታዎች**.

Here's why:

The passage states that NextGen uses satellite technology to allow air traffic controllers to ""more accurately identify aircraft and provide more precise information to pilots.""  This directly translates to more accurate aircraft locations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: አጭር የበረራ መንገዶች** - While NextGen *enables* shorter routes, it doesn't directly *use* them in its operation. The shorter routes are a *result* of the system.
*   **C: የቀነሰ የካርቦን ልቀት** - Reduced carbon emissions are a *benefit* of NextGen, not how it directly functions.
*   **D: ያነሰ ነዳጅ** - Less fuel consumption is also a *benefit*, not a direct use of the system by air traffic controllers.

በምንባቡ መሰረት የታሪክ ተመራማሪዎች FBIን ምን ላይ ያተኮረ ነው ብለው ያልነቀፉት ነገር ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: የስኬታቸው መጠን መጨመር**.

Here's why:

The passage states historians criticized the FBI for focusing on stolen car cases *in an effort to increase their clearance rate* (success rate).  The question asks what the historians *didn't* criticize the FBI for. The other options are all specifically mentioned as points of criticism:

* **B:** The FBI was criticized for spending resources on easily solvable cases (like stolen cars).
* **C:** The FBI's involvement with pornography (funding sting operations and sending agents to porn sets) is a clear criticism.
* **D:** Focusing on stolen car cases *is* the focus of the historians' criticism.

Therefore, the historians didn't criticize the FBI *for trying* to increase their success rate, only for *how* they were doing it."
የብልግና ተነሳሽነት FBI ምን እንዲያደርግ ነው ያስገደደው?,"The correct answer is **D: ለፖርኖግራፊ ጉዳዮች ወኪሎችን እንዲመድብ**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that ""FBI 10 agents had to be dedicated to providing assistance to the adult film industry"" as a result of the incentive program. This directly answers the question of what the incentive compelled the FBI to do.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the passage mentions stolen car cases, the incentive wasn't *specifically* to dedicate resources to them.
*   **B:** The incentive was a *means* to increase the success rate, not the action itself.
*   **C:** Focusing on easily solvable cases is mentioned as a strategy linked to the FBI's broader goals, but not as a direct requirement of the incentive program.

ለ JAS 39C Gripen አደጋ ምላሽ የሰጠው የእሳት አደጋ መኪና ምን ሆነ? ,"The correct answer is **B: ተገለበጠ (tergeletbeṭa)**.

The passage states: ""አካባቢው መገናኛ ብዙሐን እንደዘገበው አንድ የአየር ማረፊያ የእሳት አደጋ ተሽከርካሪ በስራ ላይ እንዳለ ተገልብጧል።"" which translates to ""Local media reported that an airport fire truck overturned while in operation.""

The text states: ""...therefore they closed that airport **to commercial flights**."" 

The other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While a fire truck overturned, the airport closure wasn't *because* of the fire truck itself, but the accident.
* **C:** The media reported on the event, but didn't cause the closure.
* **D:** The squadron leader (pilot) was involved, but that's not the *reason* the airport was closed.

በኢራን አብዮት ጊዜ ብሬዚንስኪ መመሪያ የሰጠው ለማን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

The text states that Zbigniew Brzezinski advised Carter on the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979, which occurred during the Iranian Revolution. Therefore, he was giving guidance to Carter at that time."
እስከ 1977 ድረስ የብሔራዊ ደህንነት አማካሪ ቦታን የያዘው ማን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **B: Kissinger**.

The text states that Zbigniew Brzezinski *replaced* Henry Kissinger as National Security Advisor in 1977. Therefore, Kissinger held the position until 1977."

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states Bobek scored **403** goals in 468 games, not *more than* 468 goals.
*   The passage clearly says no player has played more games or scored more goals than Bobek for Partizan Belgrade.
*   The passage confirms he was chosen as the greatest player in Partizan's history in 1995.

Therefore, option A is the only one that contradicts the information provided in the text."

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""He joined them in 1945 and stayed until 1958."" This directly supports option A.
*   Option B is correct - he was born in Zagreb, but the text doesn’t say he *played* for a team there.
*   Option C is incorrect. The passage states he left in 1958, not that he played until 1995. 1995 is the year he was *recognized* as the best player.
*   Option D is partially true, but the passage focuses on his accomplishments *while* playing, not solely on the recognition later in 1995."

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states that the second claw of *Hesperonychus* was larger, and this is what the name ""Hesperonychus"" means (""western claw""). This is a defining characteristic mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሁለት እግሮች አሉት** - Both *Hesperonychus* and *Velociraptor* walked on two legs, so this doesn't differentiate them.
*   **C: ሙሉ በሙሉ በላባ የተሸፈነ ሰውነት አለው** - While the passage mentions *Hesperonychus* was fully covered in feathers, it doesn’t say this is what *distinguishes* it from *Velociraptor*.
*   **D: ደመ ሞቃት ነው** - The passage states it was warm-blooded, but this doesn’t distinguish it from *Velociraptor* - it’s likely both were.

*   The passage explicitly states the husband, who was born in Buffalo, was shot and killed in Buffalo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ባልየውም ሚስትየውም ከቴክሳስ ነበሩ** - The passage says they were *married* in Texas, but only states the husband was born in Buffalo. We don't know where the wife is from.
*   **B: አምስት ተጠቂዎች ነበሩ** - The passage states four people were killed, it doesn't mention the number of shooters.
*   **C: ጥንዶቹ አንድ አመት ቀደም ብሎ ነገር ቡፋሎ ውስጥ የተጋቡት** - The passage states they were married *in* Texas a year ago, then *returned* to Buffalo."

Here's why:

* The text states the shooting happened while the couple was in Buffalo celebrating their first anniversary, a ""jubilee"" or celebratory event after their wedding.
* It explicitly mentions they returned to Buffalo *to celebrate with friends and family*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The text says the *regular* annual celebration was postponed, meaning this wasn't it.
* **C:** The wedding was in Texas, but the shooting was in Buffalo.
* **D:** The shooting happened a year *after* the wedding, not during the ceremony itself.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""mొదట ባለስልጣናት መርከቡ ብዙ ጭነት እንዳያፈስ ይፈሩ ነበር"" which translates to ""Initially, authorities feared the ship might spill a lot of cargo."" The context is specifically about the *LuNo*, which was carrying 120-160 cubic meters of fuel. Therefore, their initial concern was a potential oil spill.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የማዳበሪያ ካርጎ እጥረት (Fertilizer cargo shortage):** The passage mentions the ship was *on its way* to receive fertilizer, but doesn't say there was a fear of a shortage.
*   **B: ሞገዶች እና ከፍተኛ ንፋሶች (Waves and high winds):** These were the *conditions* causing the problem, not the initial fear of the authorities.
*   **D: በመርከቡ አባላት ላይ ሊከሰቱ የሚችሉ ጉዳቶች (Potential injuries to ship's crew):** While crew safety is important, the passage specifically highlights the fear of cargo spillage first. The fact that the crew was rescued with only a broken nose came *after* the initial concern.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the ship was carrying 120-160 cubic meters of fuel.** Option B claims it was carrying 100 meters, which contradicts the given information.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: ብልሽቱ የተከሰተው ካርጎውን ከማንሳቱ በፊት ነበር** - The passage describes the ship being hit by waves while carrying fuel, implying the incident happened *before* any cargo spilling.
* **C: ከአስራ ሁለቱ ሰራተኞች ውስጥ ጉዳት የደረሰበት አንዱ ነው** -  The text says ""the only injury was a broken nose,"" indicating one of the twelve rescued workers sustained an injury.
* **D: መርከቧ ወደ ውሃ መስበሪያው ተገፍታ ነበር** - The passage explicitly states the ship was ""driven towards the water reservoir.""

Here's why:

The passage states that *because* too many people gathered, not everyone could access St. Peter's Square for the funeral service. Instead, large TV screens were set up **in various locations *around* Rome** to allow the public to watch. This implies TV screens were *not* placed *within* St. Peter’s Square itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በመላው ሮም (Throughout Rome):** The passage explicitly states TV screens *were* set up throughout Rome.
*   **B: በተለያዩ የጣሊያን ከተማዎች (In various other Italian cities):** The passage says TV screens were set up in other Italian cities.
*   **C: በፖላንድ ውስጥ በሚገኙ የተወሰኑ አካባቢዎች (In specific locations in Poland):** The passage says similar setups (presumably with TV screens) were created in Poland.

* The passage specifically states the funeral service was held in St. Peter's Square. While it was also broadcast to other locations, the *location* of the service itself was St. Peter's Square.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: በመላው ሮም በሚገኙ የተለያዩ አካባቢዎች ውስጥ** - While screens were set up around Rome, the service wasn't *held* in all those places.
* **B: ፖላንድ ውስጥ** - Poland had large gatherings to *watch* the service, but it wasn't where the service took place.
* **D: በቅድሚያ ሮም ውስጥ፣ ከዚያ በሌላ የጣሊያን ከተማዎች ውስጥ** - The service was primarily in Rome (St. Peter's Square), and other cities just had viewing arrangements.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ማንም** - The text specifically states people *were* treated.
* **C: የጋዝ ኩባንያ ባለስልጣን** - The text doesn't mention the gas company official being injured.
* **D: ጎረቤት** - The text doesn't mention the neighbor being injured.

While others were injured, the question specifically asks about *deaths*."
በጥቃቱ ወቅት የሆነ ጊዜ ላይ የማን መሳሪያ ነው መተኮስ ያቃተው?,"The correct answer is **B: Uka**.

The text states: ""የ Uka መሣሪያ አልተሳካም።"" which translates to ""Uka's weapon misfired."" This directly answers the question about whose weapon failed to fire during the attack.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...basebol and softball were removed from the Olympic program in 2005."" This means they *were* previously part of the Olympic program and were removed, making them the ones ""voted out"". The other options were attempting to *get in*, not removed from it."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሮለን ስፖርቶች** - The passage states roller sports *tried* to get included but weren't selected.
*   **B: ቤዝቦል** - The passage states baseball *tried* to get included but wasn't selected.
*   **D: ሶፍት ቦል** - The passage states softball *tried* to get included but wasn't selected."

The passage states Arthur Guinness signed a 9,000-year lease for the St. James's Gate brewery. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 250** - This is how many years *after* the lease was signed that Guinness became a global business, not the length of the lease.
*   **B: 10** - This is the annual revenue of Guinness, not the lease length.
*   **C: 1759** - This is the year the lease was signed, not the lease length."
ጊነስ በየአመቱ ስንት ቢሊዮን ዶላሮች አካባቢ ያስገባል?,"The correct answer is **C: 14**.

The text states Guinness generates approximately US$14.7 billion annually, which rounds down to 14 billion. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 9** - This number isn't directly stated in the text.
*   **B: 250** - This refers to the number of years since the original lease, not the revenue.
*   **D: 10** - While close to the Euro amount, the question asks for the dollar amount, which is 14.7 billion."

The passage explicitly states that the H5N1 virus was confirmed in a wild duck near Lyon, in eastern France. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ጀርመን (Germany):** While Germany *has* had cases of H5N1, the passage states the recent finding was in France.
* **C: ዴንማርክ (Denmark):** The passage says suspected cases in Denmark haven't been confirmed.
* **D: ግሪክ (Greece):** Greece is listed as a country *already* affected by the virus, but not the location of this *recent* finding.

በሰላም አስከባሪዎች ምክንያት ከመስፋፋቱ በፊት በሽታው ሀይቲ ውስጥ ለመጨረሻ ጊዜ የተገኘው መቼ ነበር?,"The correct answer is **A: 1800ዎቹ**.

The passage states: ""ወታደሮች ከመድረሳቸው በፊት ሄይቲ ከ 1800ዎቹ ጀምሮ ከበሽታው ጋር የተያያዙ ችግሮች አጋጥሟት አያውቅም።"" This directly answers the question, stating that Haiti hadn't experienced issues with the disease since the 1800s.



"
ለበሽታው መንሰራፋት አስተዋጾ የነበረው ከየትኛው አካባቢ የመጣ ውጋጅ ነበር?,"The correct answer is **A: ከአርቲቦንያት ወንዝ (Artibonite River)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that bacteria entered the Artibonite River due to improperly disposed waste from the UN camp, leading to the outbreak.  While the UN camp is the source of the bacteria, the *river* is where the spread originated from.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ከተመድ መጠለያ (From the temporary shelter/camp):** The camp is where the problem *started*, but the river is where it *spread*.
* **C: ከ 2010 የመሬት መንቀጥቀጥ ቦታ (From the 2010 earthquake site):** The earthquake created the conditions for the outbreak to be devastating, but it didn't *cause* the disease itself.
* **D: ከሀይቲዎች የፍትህ እና ዴሞክራሲ ተቋም (From Haiti’s Institute of Justice and Democracy):** This organization investigated the issue, but wasn't a source of the spread.

የአየርላንድ መንግስት ምን ለማድረግ ነው ያቀደው?,"The correct answer is **C: የአደንዛዥ እጽ ፈቃዶች ህጎችን ማላላት**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""የአየርላንድ መንግሥት ሁኔታውን ለማስተካከል የፓርላሜንታዊ ሕግ አጣዳፊነትን በአጽንኦት እየገለጸ ነው።"" (The Irish government is strongly expressing the need for parliamentary legislation to rectify the situation). This suggests they are changing the laws around drugs.
* **The text also mentions:** ""የጤና ጥበቃ ሚኒስትሩ የተካተቱትን ንጥረ ነገሮች ጊዜያዊ ህጋዊነት ለሚጠቀሙ ግለሰቦች ደህንነትም ሆነ አሁን ከህገ-መንግስቱ ጋር የሚስማሙ ለውጦች ሥራ ላይ ከዋሉ ጀምሮ ለተላለፉት መድኃኒቶች-ነክ ጥፋተኞች አሳስበዋል።"" (The Minister for Health has raised concerns about the safety of individuals using substances with temporary legality, and those convicted of drug offenses before the new changes come into effect). This indicates a move towards a more relaxed approach regarding certain drugs – *loosening* the laws.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ለአደንዛዥ እጽ ወንጀለኞች ፍርድ መስጠት:** The text doesn’t focus on sentencing, but rather on changes to the *laws* themselves.
* **B: በአደንዛዥ እጽ ፈቃዶች ላይ የበለጠ ጥብቅ ሕጎችን ማምጣት:** The passage suggests the opposite - a loosening of the laws.
* **D: አደንዛዥ እጽን ህገ ወጥ አለማድረግ:** While the changes might involve some substances becoming legal, the text doesn't state a complete abolishment of drug prohibition.



"
አየርላንድ ውስጥ ለጊዜው ህጋዊ የነበረው ምን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **D: አደንዛዥ እጽ (Drugs)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Minister of Health expressed concerns about the ""time-limited legality of the included substances"" and those who had transgressed laws regarding them. This directly implies that certain drugs were temporarily legal in Ireland.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ዝርፊያ (Theft)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about theft.
*   **B: ማጭበርበር (Fraud)** -  The passage doesn't discuss fraud.
*   **C: ጥቃት (Assault)** - The passage doesn't relate to assault.



"
ተጠርጣሪው ወንጀለኛ ምርመራ እየተደረገበት የነበረው ለምን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **C: ንብረት በማውደም**.

Here's why: The passage states the suspect was being investigated for defacing property (""vandalism"").  Defacing property *is* damaging or destroying property. The description of the altered sign – changing an ""O"" to an ""e"" with paint – clearly falls under this category.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የተከለለ ቦታን በመጣስ** – The passage doesn’t mention any trespassing.
*   **B: አካላዊ ጉዳት** – The passage specifically states “the victim did not suffer physical harm.”
*   **D: ስርቆት** – There's no mention of theft.



"
ምልክቱን ሲቀይር ተጠርጣሪው ያላደረገው ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: በእሱ ላይ አካላዊ ጉዳት ማድረስ**.

The passage specifically states that the sign was defaced *not* with physical damage, but with paint. The other options are things the suspect *did* do:

*   **A:** He changed a letter (""O"" to ""e"")
*   **B:** He marked it with peace signs and hearts.
*   **D:** He used paint to alter it (paint is a type of tarpaulin).



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት የእንግሊዝኛ አስጠኚው ካርኖ ያልተከሰሰው በየትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: ተማሪ እጮኛ በማድረግ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Karno was *accused* of using vulgar language in class, but it doesn't say he was *charged* or *convicted* of abusing students.** It only mentions allegations of inappropriate language.
* **The passage explicitly mentions Karno was previously *sued* for copyright infringement (A) but *wasn't punished*.**
* **The passage explicitly states Modern Education (Karno's employer) was involved in printing unauthorized advertisements (C).**
* **The passage explicitly states Karno used offensive language in his notes and in the classroom (D).**

Therefore, being a student abuser (ተማሪ እጮኛ በማድረግ) is the only action not mentioned as something Karno was accused or found to have done."
በምንባቡ መሰረት በሮናልዶ ሜንዶዛ ያልታገተው ማነው?,"The correct answer is **B: ፖሊሶች** (Police).

Here's why:

* **The passage states Rolando Mendoza held *Hong Kong tourists* hostage.**
* **It also mentions he held *children* (ሕፃናትን) and *elderly* (አዛውንትን) among the hostages.**
* **The *photojournalists* (የፊሊፒኖ ፎቶ ባለሞያዎች) were released.**
* **The passage does *not* mention police being held hostage by Mendoza.** In fact, it implies they were involved in the response to the situation, ultimately killing him.

Therefore, police were not among those Mendoza held hostage.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት በጊዜ እንደተለቀቁ ያልተረጋገጡት ታጋቾች የትኞቹ ናቸው?,"The correct answer is **A: ቱሪስቶቹ**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""several hostages were rescued"" and specifically mentions that six tourists, along with Filipino photojournalists, elderly women, and children were released. It doesn't say *all* the tourists were released, only that some were rescued. Therefore, the tourists who haven't been confirmed released are those who were initially held hostage but weren't part of the group specifically mentioned as rescued.

በምንባቡ መሰረት ብራዚል ውስጥ የተመሳሳይ ጾታ ጋብቻን ህጋዊ ማድረግን በመደገፍ ፊርማ ሲያሰባስብ የነበረው ማን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **D: Marta Suplicy**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""The first law was proposed by former São Paulo mayor Marta Suplicy."" This indicates she was the one who initially pushed for the legalization of same-sex marriage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Peaceful protesters:** While protesters are mentioned as *opposing* the law, the passage doesn't say they were collecting signatures *in favor* of it.
*   **B: Roberto Jefferson:** The passage says the bill is *currently* with Roberto Jefferson, meaning he's reviewing it, not initiating support.
*   **C: The Roman Catholic Church:** The passage explicitly states the Catholic Church *opposes* same-sex marriage.



"
ሰላማዊ ሰልፈኞቹ ድምጻቸውን ለማን ይሰጣሉ?,"The correct answer is **C: የብራዚል ብሔራዊ ኮንግረስ (Brazilian National Congress)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that opponents are collecting 1.2 million signatures to present to the National Congress. This clearly indicates they are trying to influence the lawmakers in the National Congress to vote against legalizing same-sex civil unions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: የሮማን ካቶሊክ ቤተ ክርስቲያን (The Roman Catholic Church):** While the Catholic Church opposes same-sex marriage, the petition is not *to* the church, but to the government.
* **B: ሮበርቶ ጄፈርሰን (Roberto Jefferson):** Roberto Jefferson currently *has* the bill, but the petition isn't directed *to* him personally, it's to the broader legislative body.
* **D: ለሳኦ ፓውሎ ከንቲባ (To the São Paulo mayor):** Marta Suplicy proposed an earlier version of the bill, but she is not currently the target of the petition.

በአርማንድ ቬርሴስ ዘገባ መሰረት ሕዝቡ ለአየር ሁኔታው ምላሽ መስጠት ከመጀመሩ በፊት ምን ተከሰተ?,"The correct answer is **C: ከባድ ንፋሶች ነበሩ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""በመስታወቱ አምስት ደቂቃ በኋላ ንፋሱ መግባት ይጀምራል፣ ከአንድ ደቂቃ በኋላ ንፋሱ 70ኪ.ሜ/ሰዓ. እየደረሰ ነው…"" (Five minutes after the glass, the wind will start to blow, after one minute the wind reaches 70 km/h...).

This clearly indicates that strong winds were the first significant weather event described *before* the rain and hail.  The other options are events that happened *after* the winds started, or details about Armand's personal experience (losing his sister, seeing disabled people).



"
በቨርሳክ መሰረት ከባዱ ንፋስ የጀመረው መቼ ነበር?,"The correct answer is **D: ከበረዷማ ዝናቡ በፊት**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""በመስታወቱ አምስት ደቂቃ በኋላ ንፋሱ መግባት ይጀምራል፣ ከአንድ ደቂቃ በኋላ ንፋሱ 70ኪ.ሜ/ሰዓ. እየደረሰ ነው… ከዛ ዝናቡ ይመጣል ነገር ግን በጣም ከባድ እና ትልቅ ከመሆኑ የተነሳ ቆዳህን እንደ መርፌ ይመታዋል ከዛ በረዶ ከሰማይ ወረደ"".  This clearly indicates the strong wind started *before* the icy rain (በረዶ).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ማሳያው ከጀመረ ጥቂት ደቂቃዎች በኋላ** - This is too vague. The text provides more specific timing related to the wind.
*   **B: ከዝናቡ በኋላ** - The text specifically states the wind came *before* the rain.
*   **C: እህቱን ካጣት በኋላ** -  Losing his sister is a separate event that happens *after* the wind and rain have already begun.



"
ከፍሬድ አስቀድሞ 35°ምዕ ምስራቅ በኩል ስንት ከባድ ማዕበሎች ተመዝግበዋል?,"The correct answer is **C: ሁለት**.

The text states that Fred is the *third* major hurricane recorded at 35°W. This implies that two hurricanes were recorded there before Fred.
"
ፍሬድ በኬፕ ቨርድ ደሴቶች አጠገብ ሳለ ወደ የትኛው አቅጣጫ ነበር ሲንቀሳቀስ የነበረው?,"The correct answer is **D: ሰሜን ምዕራብ**.

The text states: ""ፍሬድ በአሁን ሰዕት በሰሜን ምዕራብ አቅጣጫ በሰዕት 105 ማይሎች (165 ኪሜ) የሚጓዙ ንፋሶች እሉት."" This directly answers the question."
ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ በፊት ከነበረው በላይ ፈጣን ፍጥነት የነበረው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The text explicitly states that 802.11n is ""much faster"" than the previous maximum theoretical speed of 600 Mbps. The other options (802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g) are all older standards that 802.11n is designed to be compatible *with*, implying they are slower.
"
802.11n ከ 802.11b ጋር ወደ ኋላ ተኳሃኝ እንዲሆን ምን ያስፈልጋል?,"The correct answer is **D: ሁለት ራድዮኖች**.

Here's why:

The passage states that having two radios in the access point *allows* it to be backward compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g. This is the key mechanism for supporting older standards alongside the newer 802.11n.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በጣም ፈጣን ፍጥነቶች** - While 802.11n *has* faster speeds, faster speeds alone don't guarantee backward compatibility.
*   **B: ለ 802.11b በ 5.0Ghz ላይ የመስራት ችሎታ** - 802.11b operates on the 2.4 GHz frequency, not 5.0 GHz.
*   **C: የ 600Mbit/s ማስተላለፊያ** - This is the speed *of* 802.11n, not what makes it compatible with 802.11b.

የኦሎምፒክ የወርቅ ሜዳሊያ አሸናፊው በኮመንዌልዝ ጨዋታዎች ላይ ለመዋኘት ስንት ክስተቶች ይቀሩት ነበር?,"The correct answer is **B: ሶስት**.

The passage states: ""በኮመንዌልዝ ጨዋታዎች ላይ ሦስት ዱላ ቅብብሎሽ ነው"" which translates to ""He was due to compete in three events at the Commonwealth Games"". Therefore, he had three events remaining."
የኦሎምፒክ የወርቅ ሜዳሊያ አሸናፊው ለህመሙ መድሃኒት ያልወሰደው ለምን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **D: በኮመንዌልዝ ጨዋታዎች ላይ ስለማይፈቀድ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ከጨዋታዎቹ የተከለከሉ በመሆናቸው ህመሙን ለመቋቋም የሚያስፈልጉትን መድኃኒቶች መውሰድ አልቻለም"" - ""Because they were banned from the games, he couldn't take the medication he needed to cope with the pain.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ምንም ህመም አልነበረበትም** - The passage states he *had* pain and needed medication.
*   **B: የህመም ስሜት እንዲሰማው ስላደረገው** - There's no mention of intentionally inducing pain.
*   **C: በአካል ብቃቱ ላይ አሉታዊ ተጽዕኖ ያመጣል ብሎ ስለሰጋ** - While his fitness was in doubt, the reason he didn't take medication was the *ban* on those medications, not concerns about their effect on performance.

በምንባቡ መሰረት ስለ መሬት መንቀጥቀጥ እንቅስቃሴ ውዝግብ ሊያመጣ ይችል የነበረው ምን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **A: የጥቁር ደመናዎች መኖር**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while there was no reported seismic activity, the presence of plumes (dark clouds) at the base of the mountain *could* create the potential for an eruption. This potential for eruption, stemming from the plumes, is the source of possible conflicting information or concern about activity. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ከአይስላንድ ሜትሮሎጂ ቢሮ የተገኙ ሪፖርቶች:** The report from the Icelandic Met Office *confirms* no seismic activity – it doesn’t create a discrepancy.
*   **C: አለም አቀፍ የመሬት መንቀጥቀጥ ካርታ:** The map also confirms no recent seismic activity, agreeing with other sources.
*   **D: በአይስላንድ ሌሎች አካባቢዎች ሪፖርት በተደረገ እንቅስቃሴ:** The passage only mentions activity near one volcano and states there was no activity elsewhere.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት የምዕራፍ መቀየር የተከሰተው መቼ ነበር?,"The correct answer is **C: ማርች 10 ላይ**.

The passage states: ""On March 10th, a minor earthquake occurred due to a time shift northeast of the volcano's surge."" This directly indicates the timing of the earthquake."
ከሚከተሉት መግለጫዎች ውስጥ ስለ Chandrayaan-1 የጨረቃ ፕሮብ ትክክል ያልሆነው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ፕሮቡ ያስወነጨፈው ኦርቢተር ቡድን ነበረው**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Chandrayaan-1 *impacted* the moon (crashed), it did *not* deploy an orbiter team. It was a probe that directly impacted the lunar surface.
*   **B** is correct - The passage mentions it carried three scientific instruments.
*   **C** is correct - The passage states the impact was successful.
*   **D** is correct - The passage says the probe had all sides painted, carrying the Indian national flag.

Therefore, option A is the only statement that doesn't align with the information provided in the text."
ከሚከተሉት መግለጫዎች ውጥ የጨረቃ ፕሮቡን በትክክል የሚገልጸው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: አጋጭቶ ማሳረፉ የተሳካ ነበር**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ሰው አልባው የጨረቃ ሳተላይት ቻንድራያን-1 የሙን ኢምፓክት ፕሮቡን (ኤም.ኢይ.ፒ) አስወንጭፏል... በሳካኝነት በጨረቃ ደቡባዊ ጫፍ አካባቢ ወድቃለች።"" This directly confirms a successful impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ከጨረቃ ሰሜን ዋልታ አጠገብ ነው ያረፈው:** The passage states it landed near the *south* pole, not the north.
* **C: የተወነጨፈው ሰው ከጫነ ኦርቢተር ላይ ነበር:** The passage doesn't mention anything about being launched from an orbiter. It simply states it was Chandrayaan-1's probe.
* **D: ሁለት እጅግ አስፈላጊ መሳሪያዎችን ጭኖ ነበር:** The passage says it carried *three* scientific instruments.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""for the coming year the government pledged a multi-million dose viral infection vaccine to help prepare health agencies."" This indicates that the vaccine is a planned, future step in combating the disease. While the other options (insecticides, fish eaters, and mosquito coils) were *already* implemented, the vaccine is the action promised for the future."
በሽታው ወደ ሰዎች የሚተላለፈው እንዴት ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ትንኞች (Tinnies/Mosquitoes)**.

The passage states: ""በሽታውን አሳማዎች ይሸከሙትል፣ ከዚያም በወባ ትንኞች አማካኝነት ወደ ሰዎች ይተላለፋል።"" This translates to: ""Asama (a type of fish) carry the disease, and then it is transmitted to humans through mosquitoes.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ጸረ ተባዮች (Anti-biotics):** These are used to *fight* the disease, not transmit it.
*   **C: አሳማዎች (Asama):**  Asama *carry* the disease, but they don't directly transmit it to humans. It's the mosquitoes that do.
*   **D: አሳማ ያዢዎች (Asama catchers):** This refers to people who catch Asama, not the transmission method.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""የተመሳሳይ ፆታ ጥምረትን የሚከለክለው የሁለተኛው ብይን ውድቀት ወደፊት ለሲቪል ሰዎች ጥምረት በር ሊከፍት ይችላል።""  This translates to ""The failure of the second ruling prohibiting same-sex unions may open the door to civil unions in the future.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: አፋጣኝ የ HJR-3 ግምገማ (Immediate review of HJR-3)** - While HJR-3 is mentioned, the passage says it will be *revisited* in a future election, not immediately reviewed due to the ruling.
*   **C: አፋጣኝ የህግ አውጪ ስብሰባ (Immediate legislative session)** - The passage doesn't mention an immediate session.
*   **D: የተመሳሳይ-ጾታ ሲቪል ማህበራት ክልከላ (Prohibition of same-sex civil unions)** -  The failure of the ruling actually *removes* a prohibition, not reinforces it.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት ሁለተኛው አረፍተ ነገር የተሰረዘው መቼ ነበር?,"The correct answer is **A: በህግ አውጪ ስብሰባ ጊዜ**.

The passage states ""ሁለተኛው ዓረፍተነገር መጀመሪያ በህዝብ ተወካዮች ምክር ቤት ሲደመሰስ በዚህ በህግ ማውጣት ጊዜ ላይ ለውጥ ተደርጎ ነበር"". This directly translates to ""The second bill was rejected during the legislative session"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: በ 2011** - While the first bill passed in 2011, the second bill's rejection happened *during* a legislative session, the text doesn't specify the year.
*   **C: ሰኞ ላይ** - The bill was *transferred* to the Senate on Monday, not rejected on that day.
*   **D: በ 2015** - 2015 is mentioned regarding a potential future review (HJR-3), not the rejection of the second bill.



"
የ”ፓናማ ወረቀቶች” አምልጠው የወጡት ለማን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **B: ለጋዜጣ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""የፓናማ ወረቀቶች ... ወደ ጋዜጠኞች በጸደይ 2016 የተለቀቁትን ... ሰነዶችን የሚወክል ሀረግ ነው።"" (The Panama Papers... represent a leak of over ten million documents to journalists in spring 2016).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ለሞዛክ ፎንሴካ ድርጅት (For Mossack Fonseca):** Mossack Fonseca was the Panamanian law firm *from which* the documents were leaked, not *to whom* they were released.
*   **C: ለዱች ባንክ (For Deutsche Bank):** Deutsche Bank was mentioned as controlling a significant number of shell companies involved, but they weren't the recipients of the leak.
*   **D: ለአይስላንድ መንግስት መሪዎች (For Icelandic government leaders):** The leaders were affected *by* the leak, but weren't given the documents themselves."

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""The Guardian ጠቁሟል። አልም አቀፍ ተቃውሞዎቹ ነበሩ፣ ብዙ የወንጀል ክሶች፣ እና የአይስላንድ እና የፓኪስታን መንግስት መሪዎች ሁለቱም ከስልጣን ወረዱ።"" **""one-third of the 1200 shell companies used to facilitate this were controlled by Deutsche Bank.""**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Various banks' good customers:** While the passage discusses banks helping clients, it doesn't say British press manages companies for them.
*   **B: The Panamanian law firm:** The law firm *leaked* the documents, but didn't manage the companies.
*   **D: The Pakistani government:** The Pakistani government was affected by the scandal, not involved in managing the companies.

Here's why:

The text states that the airliner crash ""ገደለ 168 ሰዎችን"" (killed 168 people). This is significantly more than the other incidents mentioned:

*   The police helicopter crash killed 3 and injured 3.
*   The Mashhad plane crash killed 17.

Therefore, the airliner crash had the highest loss of life."
ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ በኢራን ውስጥ ለተከሰቱት የአየር አደጋዎች ብዛት ምክንያት ያልሆነው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: አዲስ አውሮፕላኖችን ለመግዛት ያገጠመው የበጀት እጥረት**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the problem isn't a *lack of budget* but a lack of ability to *buy* new planes due to international sanctions.**  Sanctions prevent them from spending money on new planes, even if they had the funds.
* **A: ያረጁ የህዝብ እና የወታደር አውሮፕላኖች** - The passage explicitly mentions old, aging fleets as a contributing factor.
* **C: የአዲስ አውሮፕላኖች ግዢን የሚከለክሉ ማዕቀቦች** - The passage directly states sanctions prevent buying new planes.
* **D: በደካማ ሁኔታ እንክብካቤ የሚያገኙ አውሮፕላኖች** - While not stated directly, the aging fleet implies maintenance issues are likely contributing to the crashes.

Therefore, a budget shortage isn't the cause – the *inability* to spend due to sanctions is."

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the report warns that *any* action taken in Iraq could escalate conflict, potentially leading to civil war or wider destabilization.** It doesn't offer assurances that changes will *reduce* violence. In fact, it implies the opposite – that the situation is very precarious.

Let's look at why the other options *are* in the report:

* **A: የአሁኑ ፖሊሲ ነቀፌታ (Criticism of current policy):** The passage says the report is ""highly critical of the current executive policy direction"" and urges a change.
* **C: የኢራቅን ድንበሮች ደህንነት የመጠበቅ ምክሮች (Recommendations to secure Iraq's borders):**  The first of 78 recommendations is specifically about protecting Iraq's borders.
* **D: የሰሜን አሜሪካ የጋራ መግባባትን መጠየቅ (Calling for a consensus in North America):** The report seeks ""to create a common understanding in America about policy in the Middle East.""

Therefore, option B is the only statement *not* found within the information provided in the passage."

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ማስጠንቀቂያው በዚህ ወቅት በኢራቅ ውስጥ የሚወሰደው ማንኛውም እርምጃ የሃይማኖት ጦርነትን ፣ የግጭት መጨመርን ወይም ወደ ትርምስ መንሸራተትን ያስቆማል የሚል ማንም ዋስትና ሊሰጥ አይችልም።"" (No guarantee can be given that any action taken in Iraq at this time will prevent sectarian warfare, escalation of conflict, or a slide toward chaos.) This directly indicates the report *does not* request a guarantee to stop escalating attacks.

Let's look at why the other options *are* requested:

* **B: አፋጣኝ የአቅጣጫ ለውጥ (An urgent change in direction):** The passage states the report ""አሳስቧል።"" (urged) for an immediate change in the current policy direction.
* **C: ክፍት ክርክርን መጠቀም (Utilizing open debate):** The report ""በክፍት የሆነ ክርክር እንዲኖር በመጠየቅ"" (by requesting an open debate) explicitly requests this.
* **D: አዲስ የዲፕሎማሲያዎ ተነሳሽነት መመስረት (Establishing a new diplomatic initiative):** The first of the 78 recommendations is to establish a new diplomatic initiative before the end of the year.

The passage states: ""ፖሊሶች ሎ ፒኮሎ በፓሌርሞ ውስጥ የፕሮቬንዛኖ ቀኝ እጅ ስለነበር..."" (Police suspected Lo Piccolo because he was Provenzano's right-hand man in Palermo...).

The passage states Hitoshi Saito was the *chairman* of the All Japan Judo Federation's training committee at the time of his death, not a committee head.  The other options are directly stated or implied in the text:

*   **A:** He was a former Olympic and *World* champion.
*   **C:** He won *two Olympic gold medals*.
*   **D:** Being a two-time Olympic and world champion signifies he was a judo professional."
ኢዋሳኪ ቃል ኪዳኖችን ከመውሰድ መቆጠብ የቻለው የት ነበር?,"The correct answer is **A: ጃፓን**.

Here's why:

The passage states Iwazaki faced trouble *in* the other locations (sea, Tibet, Nepal, India). It doesn't mention any problems occurring in Japan, implying that's where he was able to avoid difficulties and keep his vows.
"
ኢዋሳኪን ያጠቃው ማን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **B: የባህር ወንበዴዎች** (Pirates).

Here's why:

* The passage states ኢዋሳኪ was ""ዘርፏል በባህር ላይ ወንበዴዎች"" which translates to ""robbed by pirates at sea."" This directly identifies pirates as one of the attackers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: የትዳር አጋሩ (His/Her spouse):** The passage mentions escaping from a marriage, not being attacked *by* a spouse.
* **C: ውሻ (Dog):** He was bitten by a dog, but not attacked in a hostile way.
* **D: ፖሊስ (Police):** He was imprisoned, but the text doesn't state he was attacked by the police.

አሎንሶ ውድድሩን ያቋረጠው መቼ ነበር?,"The correct answer is **A: ሽማከር የፊት ጎማውን ከጎዳበት በኋላ**.

Here's why:

The text states that Alonso was leading for most of the race but *finished* after a pit stop, and the reason was potentially a damaged front wheel. This implies the issue occurred *after* the pit stop, and linked to a potential collision with Schumacher.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ፊሲቼላ መኪናውን መቆጣጠር ካቃተው በኋላ** - Fisichella's retirement was at the start, unrelated to Alonso.
* **C: ሽማከር ውድድሩን ካቋረጠ በኋላ** - Schumacher crashed *after* Alonso had already had issues.
* **D: መሪነቱን ከመውሰዱ በፊት** - Alonso finished the race *after* being in the lead.

The passage explicitly states: ""ሚካኤል ሽማከር ውድድሩ ከአሎሶ ብዙም ሳይቆይ አቋርጧል፣ ምክንያቱም በውድድሩ ወቅት በነበሩት በርካታ ውጊያዎች ላይ በደረሰበት የሰስፔንሽን አደጋ ምክንያት።"" (Michael Schumacher retired shortly after Alonso, due to suspension damage sustained in numerous incidents during the race.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: መኪናውን መቆጣጠር አቃተው** - This describes Fischella's situation, not Schumacher's.
*   **B: ከአሎንሶ ጋር መገጨቱ** - The passage mentions ""incidents"" but doesn't specifically state a collision with Alonso caused the damage.
*   **C: በፊሲቼላ የተከሰተ የጎማ ጉዳት** - This relates to Alonso's problem, not Schumacher's."

Here's why:

The passage states: ""If accepted, the commissioner posts bail and prosecutes the charges presented by the arresting officer."" This directly indicates the commissioner is responsible for posting bail.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: አሳሪ መኮንኑ (Arresting Officer):** The passage states the commissioner *prosecutes* the charges presented *by* the arresting officer, meaning they don't post bail.
*   **B: ዳኛ ግሊን (Judge Glin):** Judge Glin issued the order to release the detainees, but the passage doesn't say she posts bail.
*   **C: ማዕከላዊ ቦታ ማስያዣ ተቋም (Central Booking Facility):** The facility holds the detainees, but doesn't post bail or prosecute charges.

Here's why:

The passage states that Judge Gellini ordered the release of detainees held over 24 hours without a court commissioner's approval.  If the commissioner *approves*, they set bail and the charges filed by the arresting officer are entered into the state computer system. This means bail is the condition that allows them to be released after being held beyond 24 hours.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ከአሳሪ መኮንኑ ጋር ስብሰባ (Meeting with the arresting officer):** The passage doesn't mention a meeting as a requirement for release.
* **C: በዳኛ ግሊን የተሰጡ መደበኛ ክሶች (Formal charges by Judge Gellini):** The passage says charges *filed by the arresting officer* are entered, not new charges issued by the judge. The judge is ordering the *release* based on lack of commissioner approval, not initiating charges.
* **D: ችሎት (Trial):** A trial comes *after* charges are filed, not as a condition for release after being held over 24 hours.

The passage explicitly states that Lodin authorities cancelled the second round ""to save Afghans from loss and security concerns that another election would bring."" While other options are mentioned, security concerns are directly given as a reason for the cancellation.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ሕገ-መንግስቱን ይፃረራል** - The passage states that previous reports *claimed* it was unconstitutional, but the current situation is that diplomats found sufficient ambiguity to consider the second round unnecessary.
*   **C: ከፍተኛ ኪሳራ** - Loss is mentioned alongside security concerns, but it's not presented as the primary reason.
*   **D: አሻሚ ህገ መንግስታዊነት** - While constitutional ambiguity is discussed, it isn't the *reason* given for the cancellation; it's a finding that allowed the cancellation to be considered."

Here's why:

The passage states that diplomats found ""sufficient ambiguity in the Afghan constitution"" to determine the second round unnecessary. This means there were issues or unclear points *within the constitution itself* that allowed them to justify cancelling the round. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ህገ መንግስቱን ይጻረር ነበር** - The passage actually states this *contrasts* with previous reports.
*   **B: የፀጥታ ስጋቶች ነበሩ** - While security concerns are mentioned as a reason cited by Lodin authorities, the *reason the diplomats used* was related to the constitution.
*   **D: ምርጫው በጣም ውድ ነበር** - Cost is not mentioned in the passage.

The passage explicitly states: ""these agents are responsible for providing state and judicial services in the area under Article 247 of the Pakistan Constitution.""  These ""agents"" are referred to as ""political agents"" who are appointed by the President.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: የፓኪስታን መንግስት** (Pakistani Government) - While ultimately responsible, the passage states the *agents* deliver the services, not the government directly.
* **C: የፓኪስታን ፕሬዝዳንት** (Pakistani President) - The President *appoints* the agents, but doesn't provide the services themselves.
* **D: የብሪቴይን መንግስት** (British Government) - Britain's rule ended in 1947; they no longer have authority in the region.

Here's why:

The passage states the ""political agents"" are appointed by the President and operate *under* Article 247 of the Pakistani constitution. However, it doesn't say they *follow* the entire constitution. Article 247 specifically deals with the administration of the tribal areas (FATA) and grants special provisions, implying they operate under a different set of rules than the rest of Pakistan.  They have significant autonomy, and the passage implies they have nearly complete control.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

*   **A: እነሱ የፍትህ አገልግሎቶች ያቀርባሉ** - The passage explicitly states they are responsible for providing state and judicial services.
*   **B: የተመረጡት በፓኪስታን ፕሬዝዳንት ነው** - The passage states the President appoints them.
*   **D: እነሱ በተወሰኑ ቦታዎች ላይ ሙሉ ለሙሉ ቁጥጥር አላቸው** - The passage states the President appoints agents with ""nearly complete control"" over the region.

"
ፊልሙ ለየትኛው ሽልማት ነበር ያልታጨው?,"The correct answer is **B: ምርጥ የእይታ ውጤቶች**.

Here's why:

The passage lists all the categories the film *was* nominated for, and ""Best Visual Effects"" is not among them. The passage specifically mentions nominations for:

*   Best Actor & Actress (Gosling & Stone)
*   Best Picture
*   Directing
*   Cinematography
*   Costume Design
*   Film Editing
*   Original Score (two songs listed)
*   Production Design
*   Sound Editing
*   Sound Mixing
*   Original Screenplay

Therefore, the film was not nominated for Best Visual Effects."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በHokuriku Shika ፋብሪካ ላይ ያሉ ሁሉም ሬአክተሮች** - The passage states reactors 1 & 2 at the Shika Nuclear Power Plant were *shut down*.
*   **B: በIshikawa በኢሺካዋ መስተዳድር የሚገኘው አየር ማረፊያ** - The passage says the Noto Airport in Ishikawa *was closed*.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Some roads were damaged, rail services were suspended in the affected areas, and Noto Airport in Ishikawa Prefecture was closed."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: አንዳንድ ቤቶች** - While the passage mentions homes without water and electricity, it doesn't explicitly state they were *damaged* by the earthquake.
*   **B: በShika ፋብሪካ ላይ ሁለት ሬአክተሮች** - The passage says the reactors were *shut down* as a precaution, not that they were damaged.
*   **D: የNoto አየር ማረፊያ** - The passage says the airport was *closed*, not that it was damaged.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    *   **A: የእየሩሳሌም የወደፊት ሁኔታ (The future status of Jerusalem)** - ""...the future status of Jerusalem...""
    *   **C: በሸለቆው ውስጥ ቀጣይነት ያለው ወታደራዊ መገኘት (Continued military presence in the valley)** - ""...Israel wants a continued military presence in the valley for ten years...PA would agree to such a presence for only five years.""
    *   **D: የድንበር ውዝግብ (Border dispute)** - ""...relates to a border dispute that Palestine seeks to base on pre-1967...""

*   **The passage does *not* mention:**
    *   **B: የ1967ቱ ጦርነት መንስኤ (The cause of the 1967 war)** - It only states the dispute relates to borders *before* the war, but doesn't discuss *why* the war happened.

Therefore, the only topic not covered in the provided text is the cause of the 1967 war."

Here's why:

The text states that *Israel* wants a continued military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years. The Palestinian Authority (PA) only agrees to a five-year presence.  This means a *continuous* military presence isn't what Palestine desires, they are seeking a limited, five-year presence.

Let's look at why the other options *are* Palestinian interests:

*   **A: ከጦርነት በፊት በነበሩ ሁኔታዎች የተመሰረቱ ድንበሮች** - The passage explicitly states Palestine wants borders based on the 1967 lines.
*   **C: የወደፊቱን የኢየሩሳሌምን ሁኔታ የተመለከቱ መልሶች** - The text says the future of Jerusalem is a covered topic, implying Palestine has interests in it.
*   **D: ለዮርዳኖስ ሸለቆ ውስጥ የአምስት ዓመት ወታደራዊ መገኘት** - The text states the PA agrees to a five-year military presence, making it a part of their desired outcome.

The passage states that Ma won on a platform that ""fosters closer ties with mainland China."" This indicates support from China was a factor in his victory.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: አሜሪካ:** While Ma has ties to the US (education and a Green Card), the passage doesn't mention US support being a factor in his win.
*   **B: ሆንግ ኮንግ:**  Ma was born in Hong Kong, but the passage specifically mentions his platform focusing on mainland China.
*   **C: ዩናይትድ ኪንግደም:** There is no mention of the United Kingdom in the passage.

Here's why:

The passage states that Carolyn Wilson worked at OHA (likely a housing authority) and that many families realized she had misappropriated their security deposits. This directly links her to working *for* OHA before the issues came to light.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: East Bay Community Law Center:** This organization *held a meeting* to help the tenants, but Carolyn Wilson didn't work for them.
*   **B: የOakland ፖሊስ:** The police are investigating the fraud, but Wilson wasn't working for them.
*   **D: Lockwood Gardens:** This is the name of a housing complex where some of the affected tenants live, not Wilson's employer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ሁሉም ሐምሌ በነበረው የተወርዋሪ ኮከቦች ዝናብ ጊዜ ተገኝተዋል (All were found during the July meteor shower):** The passage states 15 of the Martian meteorites were from the July shower, *not* all of them.
* **B: እነዚህም 24,000 ናቸው (These are 24,000):** The passage says there are about 24,000 known meteorites *total*, not specifically Martian ones.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ከFelipe Massa ግጭት በኋላ** - The text says Schumacher *replaced* Massa, not that he retired after the incident.
*   **C: Felipe Massa ን ከተካ በኋላ** - He retired *before* replacing Massa.

*   **C:** Schumacher's retirement is mentioned as background, but not directly related to when Massa was injured.
*   **D:** Massa was injured *during* the 2009 season, not before it."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: የAOL የደንበኛ ቁጥር ብዛት ሊጨምር ይችላል** - The passage indicates a *challenge* to AOL's user base, not a potential increase.
* **B: AOL የIM ገበያ ያዘጋጀው ብቸኛ ኩባንያ ይሆናል** - The passage explicitly states AOL's dominance might *end* due to competition.
* **D: AOL ከዚህ በኋላ አሜሪካ ውስጥ ጥቅም ላይ አይውልም** - The passage doesn't suggest AOL will disappear, only that its market position is threatened.



"
ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ አዲሱን ዝግጅት ተከትሎ የሚያበቃው የትኛው ነበር?,"The correct answer is **C: AOL በራሱ ፍጥነት ገበያውን የማዳበር ነፃነት**.

Here's why:

The passage states that AOL's dominance was being challenged because Yahoo! and Microsoft's combined user base was becoming comparable to AOL's.  The phrase ""this freedom might end"" directly refers to AOL's ability to dictate and rapidly grow the IM market on its own. The new development (the growth of Yahoo! and Microsoft) threatens that freedom.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በአሜሪካ ውስጥ ሰፊ የበይነመረብ እድገት** - While internet growth is happening, the passage doesn't say this is *ending* as a result of the new competition.
*   **B: የ IM ገበያ አጠቃቀም** -  The passage indicates the market will likely *increase* due to competition, not decrease.
*   **D: የYahoo እና የMicrosoft አጋርነት** - The passage mentions their combined user base, but doesn't state they're forming a partnership.



"
በጥቃቱ ከሞቱ ሰዎች ውስጥ የፖሊስ መኮንኖች ያልነበሩት ምን ያህል ናቸው?,"The correct answer is **C: 0**.

Here's why:

The text states two police officers were killed. It also states 19 police officers were injured. It doesn't mention any civilian deaths. Therefore, the number of people killed who were *not* police officers is zero."
በጥቃቱ ተጠርጣሪውን ማን ነው የጠቆመው?,"The correct answer is **A: ፖሊስ**.

The text states: ""ፖሊስ ጥቃቱን የፈጸመው ተጠርጣሪ የዴእሽ (ISIL) አማጺ ነው ብለው ተጠርጥረዋል።"" which translates to ""Police suspect the perpetrator of the attack is a Daesh (ISIL) militant."" 

Therefore, it was the police who pointed to the suspect."
ፍሎሪዳ አሸናፊ-ሁሉንም የሚስድ ግዛት በመሆኑ ምክንያት ለሚት ሮምኒ ምን ተሸለመ?,"The correct answer is **C: ሁሉም የግዛቱ ልዑካኖች**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Florida being a winner-take-all state, awarded all fifty of its delegates to Romney, making him the front-runner for the Republican nomination."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ከግዛቱ ልዑካኖች መካከል 32ቱ** - The passage says *all* 50 delegates were awarded, not just 32.
*   **B: የሪፐብሊካን ፓርቲ እጩ** - While winning Florida made him the front-runner, it didn't immediately make him *the* nominee.
*   **D: የድምጹ 46 በመቶ ምርጫ** - The 46% is how he *won*, but what he *received* was the delegates.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት ጂንሪች በአንደኛ ደረጃ ምርጫ ምን ያህል ድምጽ ነበራቸው?,"The correct answer is **B: 32 በመቶ**.

The text states: ""ቀድሞው የአሜሪካ የምክር ቤት አፈ ጉባኤ ኒውት ጂንግሪክ በ32 በመቶ ድምጽ ሁለተኛ ወጥቷል።"" (Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich came in second with 32 percent of the vote.)"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ የምክክር ጉባኤ ውጤት በኋላ ውድድር ያልቀጠለው ማን ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ፔሪ**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that Perry initially said he was returning to Texas to assess his campaign, but **later clarified that he would remain in the race** and compete in the South Carolina primary.
*   Gingrich and Bachmann's positions are explicitly stated as either praising another candidate (Gingrich) or dropping out (Bachmann).
*   Romney is mentioned as the target of Gingrich's criticism, but there's no information about him leaving the race.

Therefore, Perry is the only candidate mentioned who considered leaving but ultimately decided to continue."
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ከየምክክር ጉባኤ ውጤት ብኋላ ስለ ሌላ እጩ ከፍ አድርጎ የተናገረው ማን ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: ጊንግሪች**.

The text states: "" ውጤቱ ከመጣ በኋላ ጊንሪች ሳንቶረምን አድንቀዋል..."" which translates to ""After the results came in, Gingrich praised Santorum..."".  This means Gingrich spoke highly of another candidate after the caucus results.



"
ከ2015 በፊት ትርኢቱ የታየበት ብቸኛው ቦታ የት ነበር?,"The correct answer is **A: TogiNet ሬዲዮ**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""በቀደምት ጊዜያት ዝግጅቱ በበይነመረብ በሚሰራጨው በሬዲዮ ወሬ ላይ በሚያተኩረው የቶጊኔት የሬዲዮ ድረገጽ ላይ ብቻ ይተላለፍ ነበር።"" This directly translates to ""In the early days, the show was only broadcast on the TogiNet Radio website, which focuses on internet radio gossip.""
"
ጣቢያው ፕሮግራሙ ምን ዓይነት ሽክርክሪት እንዳለው ነው ገለፃ ያደረገው?,"The correct answer is **B: ጌጣጌጥ** (ጌጣጌጥ).

The website description states the show has ""a new and dazzling **flair**!"" (ጌጣጌጥ). The other options describe aspects of the show but aren't the *type* of flair it has.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: አማተር** (Amateur) - Describes the voice actors, not the show's flair.
*   **C: የድሮ ትምህርት ቤት** (Old-fashioned) - Describes the show's style, not the flair.
*   **D: አከባቢያዊ** (Local) - Describes the origin of the voice actors, not the flair."
የዴቪድ ሄድሊ የአጥቂዎችን ጥቃት በመጨረሻ የረዳው ምን ሰብስቦ ነበር?,"The correct answer is **A: መረጃ**.

Here's why:

The passage states that David Headley ""gathered and assembled intelligence"" which helped the Lashkar-e-Taiba militants. Intelligence refers to information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: የእጅ ቦምቦች** - The passage states the attackers *had* hand grenades, but Headley didn't gather them.
*   **C: ታጣቂዎች** - Headley helped facilitate the operation of the 10 attackers but didn't gather them.
*   **D: አውቶማቲክ የጦር መሳሪያዎች** - Similar to hand grenades, the attackers had these, but Headley's role was information gathering."
ታጣቂው ቡድን ወደ Mumbai ለመጓጓዣነት የተጠቀመው የትኛውን የመጓጓዣ መንገድ ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ጀልባ**.

The text explicitly states: ""የሙምባይ አጥቂዎች የእጅ ቦምቦችን ፣ አውቶማቲክ መሣሪያዎችን ይዘው በኖቬምበር 26 ቀን 2008 በጀልባ መጡ..."" (The Mumbai attackers arrived by boat on November 26, 2008, carrying hand grenades and automatic weapons...)."
በንባቡ ውስጥ የተገለጸዉን የNadal እና የRaonic Bribaneን ኦፕን ግጥሚያ ውጤቱን በትክክል የሚያንፀባርቀው የትኛው መግለጫ ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: Raonic Nadalን አሸንፏል** (Raonic defeated Nadal).

Here's why:

The passage states ""በብሪስቤን ኦፕን ውስጥ በሮአኒክ በቅርቡ ተሽንፏል።"" which translates to ""He was recently defeated by Raonic in the Brisbane Open."" This directly indicates Raonic won the match against Nadal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Raonic 88% የተጣራ ነጥብ ነበረው** (Raonic had 88% net points) - The passage says Nadal had 88% net points, not Raonic.
*   **C: Nadal Raonicን አሸንፏል** (Nadal defeated Raonic) - This is the opposite of what the passage states.
*   **D: Raonic 76 ነጥብ አመጣ** (Raonic scored 76 points) - The passage says Nadal won 76 points in the first set, not Raonic overall."
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ከመጀመሪያው ሰርቭ በኋላ የናዳል እና የሮአኒክ ግጥሚያ ነጥብ ምን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **B: ናዳል 76 ነጥብ አሸንፏል**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states, ""በመጀመሪያው ሰርብ 76 ነጥቦችን በማሸነፍ ናዳል በጨዋታ ውስጥ 88% የተጣሩ ነጥቦች አግኝቷል።"" This directly answers the question about the score after the first serve.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Raonic 88% የተጣራ ነጥብ ነበረው** - The passage says Nadal had 88% *won* points, not Raonic.
*   **C: ውጤቱም 7-2 ነበር** - This is the overall match score, but the question asks about the first serve specifically.
*   **D: Raonic Nadalን አሸንፏል** - While the passage states Nadal *lost* to Raonic in Brisbane Open, the question is about the score *after the first serve*."
በሦስቱ አዳዲስ ኔክድ ኒውስ ስርጭቶች ውስጥ ያልተካተተው የቋንቋ ፕሮግራም የትኛው ነበር?,"The correct answer is **C: ጃፓነኛ**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Nude News *already* reported in English and Japanese. It then says they are *adding* Spanish, Italian, and Korean programs. Therefore, Japanese was not one of the *new* language programs.
"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ አዲሱ የኔክድ ኒውስ ስርጭቶች የት አይገኙም?,"The correct answer is **C: ቲያቴር (Theater)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the new language programs will be available on:

*   Television
*   The web (Internet)
*   Mobile devices (Phones)

It doesn't mention any distribution through theaters. Therefore, the new broadcasts will *not* be found in theaters."
ግዙፉ ስላሉምን ያልጨረሱት ተወዳዳሪዎች ምን ያህል ናቸው?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""በግዙፉ ስላሉም ካሉት ከ117ቱ የበረዶ ተንሸራታቾች 45ቱ በውድድሩ ደረጃ ማግኘት አልቻሉም."" This means 45 competitors did not finish the Giant Slalom.

*   **A: በሁለተኛው ውድድር ካርፓኔዶ ከ ሃንጋሪ የመጣው የበረዶ ተንሸራታች በፊት ጨርሷል** - ትክክል ነው። ካርፓኔዶ ዐሥረኛ ሲሆን ሃንጋሪዋ 9ኛ ሆናለች።
*   **B: በሃንጋሪዋ 45 በረዶ ተንሸራታቾች ሩጫቸውን አላጠናቀቁም** - ስህተት ነው። በግዙፉ ስላሉም 45 የበረዶ ተንሸራታቾች ሩጫቸውን አላጠናቀቁም። ሃንጋሪዋ ግዮንግዪ ዳኒ ግን ጨርሳለች።

*   **D: በ ስላሉምን ልይ ካርፓኔዶ አስረኛ ሆኖ አጠናቋል** - ስህተት ነው። በግዙፉ ስላሉም አስረኛ ሆና አጠናቋል።

ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ NBA ለማገድ የወሰነው የትኛውን ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: የቅርጫት ኳስ የውድድር ዘመን** (The basketball season).

The passage explicitly states that the NBA suspended ""the professional basketball season"" due to COVID-19 concerns. While the positive test of a Utah Jazz player *triggered* the decision, the NBA didn't suspend the player, the team, or anyone specifically diagnosed with COVID-19 – they suspended the entire season."
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ቫይረሱን በተመለከተ የኤን.ቢ.ኤ ስጋት እንዲፈጠር ያደረገው ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: የ የዩታ ጃዝተጫዋች ቫይረሱ ተገኝቶበታል**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the NBA's decision came *following* a Utah Jazz player testing positive for COVID-19. This is the direct trigger for the concern and subsequent suspension of the season.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While NBA members having the virus is a general concern, the passage highlights a *specific* case as the catalyst.
*   **B:** The passage doesn't mention multiple players on the Jazz having the virus, only one.
*   **C:** The passage doesn't say the player played after testing positive; it says the decision came *after* the positive test.

The passage states: ""የኦቨቺኪን የምሽቱን የመጀመሪያ ማቀበል በሮኪ ኒከላስ ባክስትሮም የጨዋታ አሸናፊ ግብ ላይ ነበር"" which translates to ""Ovechkin's first assist of the night was on Nicklas Backstrom's game-winning goal.""
"
ካፒታልስ ከ ትራሸርስ ጨዋታ በውድድር ዘመኑ 60ኛ ጎሉን ያስቆጠረው ማን ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: አሌክስ ኦቭቼኪን**.

The passage states: ""…ኦቨቺኪን የምሽቱን ሁለተኛ ግቡ የወቅቱ 60ኛው ነበር።"" which directly translates to ""…Ovechkin's second goal of the night was his 60th of the season.""
"
የሰሜን ሮክ ባንክ የመንግስት ድጋፍ የፈለገው መቼ ነበር?,"The correct answer is **D: የዕዳ ቀውስ ወቅት**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ሰሜናዊ ሮክ በ2007 ሰብፕራይም የዕዳ ቀውስ ወቅት ተጋላጭ ስለነበር ድጋፍ ይፈልግ ነበር።"" (Northern Rock needed support because it was vulnerable during the 2007 subprime debt crisis.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ባንኩ የመንግስት ከሆነው ብኋላ** - The bank *received* government support, but it *needed* it before becoming nationalized.
*   **B: ባንኩ ከንብረት አስተዳደር ኩባንያው በተለየበት ግዜ** - This happened *after* the bank needed support, as a result of it.
*   **C: ቭርጅን ግሩፕ ባንኩን ከገዛ በኋላ** - Virgin Group's bid was *rejected* before the bank was nationalized.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""የአቶ ሪቻርድ ባራንሰን ቨርጅን ቡድን ባንኩ የመንግስት ከመሆኑ በፊት ለባንኩ ያወጣው ጨረታ ውድቅ ተደርጎ ነበረ።"" This directly translates to ""Richard Branson's Virgin Group had a bid rejected *before* the bank was nationalized.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ቨርጅን ግሩፕ የቨርጅን ግሩፕ ንብረት አስተዳደር ኩባንያንም ገዛ** - The passage clarifies ቨርጅን ግሩፕ ንብረት አስተዳደር ኩባንያውን አልገዛም።
*   **B: ቨርጅን ግሩፕ ባንኩ ከተወረሰ ብኋላ ገዛው** - ቨርጅን ግሩፕ ባንኩን አልገዛም። ጥሩ ባንክን ብቻ ገዛ።
*   **C: ቭርጅን ግሩፕ በዕዳ ቀውስ ወቅት ለባንኩ የድንገተኛ ጊዜ ድጋፍ አቀረበ** - The passage states Virgin made a bid, not that they provided emergency support.

በንባብቡ መሰረት፣ የክዮቶን የአየር ንብረት ስምምነት መፈረምን ያወከው የትኛው ሀገር ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ዩናይቲድ ስቴትስ (United States)**.

The text explicitly states that the decision by Mr. Rudd to sign the Kyoto Protocol *will leave the United States* as the only developed country not to ratify the agreement.  It then goes on to explain why Australia also didn't ratify it. Therefore, the US is the country identified as not signing the agreement."
የቀድሞው የአውስትራሊያ መንግሥት የየኮይቶን መፅደቅ በምን ላይ ጉዳት እንደሚያደርስ አስቦ ነበር?,"The correct answer is **B: የአገሪቱ ኢኮኖሚ**.

The passage states that the former Australian government feared Kyoto ratification would harm the country's economy because of its reliance on coal exports. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: የ ዩናይቲድ ስቴትስ** - The passage mentions the US but not as a reason for Australia's concern.
* **C: በከሰል ኤክስፖርት** - While coal exports *were* the reason for the potential economic harm, the concern was about the *economy* itself, not the exports directly.
* **D: የሀገሪቱ ልቀት መጠን ገደብ** - The passage states that countries like India and China weren't subject to binding emission reduction targets, not that Australia was concerned about its own emission limits.



"
በማረፍያ ውስጥ ያሉ ተኳሾች ለየትኛው ሙከራ ነበር የተመለመሉት?,"The correct answer is **D: በስፖርት ተኳሾች ማኅበር የአደን ፕሮግራም**.

The text explicitly states: ""በስፖርት ተኳሾች ማኅበር የአደን ፕሮግራም በኩል፣ በ NPWS እና በአውስትራሊያ ስፖርት እስኮተርስ ማህበር (NSW) Inc አጋርነት ብቁ ፈቃደኞች ተመልምለው ነበር።"" This means the shooters were recruited through the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia.
"
የተባይ መቆጣጠሪያ ሙከራን በትክክል የማያንጸባርቅ የትኛው መግለጫ ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: የፕሮግራሙ የመጀመሪያ ሙከራ ስለሆነ አልተገመገመም**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...ሙከራው በቁጥጥር ሥር ስለ ዋለ እና ውጤታማነቱ ስለ ተገመገመ"" ( ""...the trial was controlled and its effectiveness was assessed""). This directly contradicts option A.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **B: ተኳሾች የስልጠና መመሪያ አግኝተዋል** - The passage mentions the four selected shooters ""received overall safety and training command.""
*   **C: ተኳቾቹ በጠባቂዎች ቁጥጥር ይደረግባቸው ነበር** - The passage states shooters were ""closely monitored by rangers.""
*   **D: አራት ተኳሾች ተመርጠዋል** - The passage says ""the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation...""

Therefore, only option A is inaccurate based on the provided text."
በምንባቡ መሰረት ፣ክፍተቱ የት ተገኘ?,"The correct answer is **D: ኢትዮጵያ ውስጥ (In Ethiopia)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Brhane Asfaw, a researcher with the Ethiopian Rift Valley Research Service, made the statement. This directly implies the finding (the gap) is located *in Ethiopia*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በስምጥ ሸለቆ ውስጥ (In the Semit Valley)** - The text mentions the Rift Valley Research Service, but doesn't specifically state the gap was found in the Semit Valley.
*   **B: በቅሪተ አካል ላይ (On the fossil)** - The gap is *related to* the fossil, but not *found on* it. The gap is a difference in timing based on molecular evidence compared to the fossil record.
*   **C: በሞለኪውላዊ ማስረጃ (In molecular evidence)** - Molecular evidence is used to *measure* the gap, it's not where the gap *is*.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ከተተገመተው በፊት ምን ተከሰተ?,"The correct answer is **B: ክፍተቱ (the gap)**.

Here's why:

The quote states ""በዚህ ቅሪተ አካል መሰረት ክፍተቱ በሞለኪላዊ ማስረጃ ከተገመተው በላይ የቆየ ነው"" which translates to ""Based on this fossil, the gap is older than estimated by molecular evidence.""  This clearly indicates that *the gap* existed *before* it was estimated by molecular evidence. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የቅሪተ አካላት ግኝት (fossil discovery):** The quote *uses* the fossil discovery to make a statement *about* the gap, but the discovery didn't happen *before* the gap.
*   **C: የሞለኪውል ማስረጃዎች ትንተና (molecular evidence analysis):** The quote explicitly says the gap is older than the molecular evidence's estimate, meaning the analysis happened *after* the gap existed.
*   **D: በስምጥ ሸለቆ የተደረገው ጥናት (the study done in the Rift Valley):** The study is the context of the statement, not something that happened *before* what the quote describes."
አንድ ተጫዋች በቪዲዮ ጨዋታ ወቅት እንቅስቃሴዎችን ለመቀያየር ምን ማድረግ ይኖርበታል?,"The correct answer is **D: መቆጣጠሪያውን በአየር ላይ ያንቀሳቅሱት**.

Here's why:

The passage states the controller allows players to control actions and movements in video games ""by moving the device through the air.""  This directly answers the question of *how* a player changes actions during gameplay.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የመቆጣጠሪያው ሴንሰሮች ከእቃው አጠገብ መቀመጣቸውን ያረጋግጡ** - While the sensors are important, the passage doesn't say the player *needs to verify* their placement during gameplay.
*   **B: ቦታ ለመከፋፈል** -  This is a description of *how* the controller works, not what the player does.
*   **C: ሴንሰሮችን ከቴሌቪዥናቸው አጠገብ ያስቀምጡ** -  This is a setup step, not something done during gameplay.



"
የቴሌቪዥን ሪሞት ለማስመሰል ዲዛይን የተደረገው ምንድን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **B: የኒንቴንዶ ሬቮሉሽን መቆጣጠሪያ (Nintendo Revolution controller)**.

The passage explicitly states the controller was *designed to resemble a television remote*. The other options are related to the context, but don't answer the question of *what* was designed to look like a remote.

* **A: የመቆጣጠሪያው ሁለት ሴንሰሮች (The controller's two sensors)** - These are *part* of how it works, not what it's designed to look like.
* **C: ትርኢት መክፈቻ (Trade show opening)** - This is where it was presented, not the object itself.
* **D: የኒንቴንዶ ሬቮሉሽን መሳሪያ (Nintendo Revolution device)** - This is too broad; it's the controller *within* the device that has the specific design.

Here's why:

The passage states that initial reports said the plane turned back after being denied emergency landing in Urumqi. Later reports *revealed* the plane was diverted to Kandahar due to a bomb threat.  The bomb threat wasn't in the initial reporting by Xinhua.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: አውሮፕላኑ በኡሩምቂ ውስጥ አረፈ** - This was in the *first* reports.
*   **C: አውሮፕላኑ ወደ አፍጋኒስታን ተመልሷል** - This was in the first reports, although the reason wasn't initially known.
*   **D: አውሮፕላኑ በካንዳሃር አረፈ** - This was in the *later* reports.

Here's why:

The passage states the *later* reports revealed the plane was diverted due to a bomb threat. The initial report only mentioned the plane was to be intercepted, and later reports said it made an emergency landing in Urumqi.  The bomb threat information was not in the first report.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: አውሮፕላኑ ታግቷል** - The initial report *did* state the plane was to be intercepted (essentially ""detained"").
*   **B: አውሮፕላኑ ድንገተኛ ጊዜ ማረፍ ተከልክሏል** - This was mentioned in the later reports, not necessarily absent from the initial one.
*   **C: አውሮፕላኑ ወደ አፍጋኒስታን እንዲመለስ ሆኗል** - This is a consequence of the events, but not necessarily missing from the initial report; it was implied it was being diverted.

በሬዲዮ ፕሮግራሙ ወቅት ሳራ ዳኒየስ ምን አሳወቀች?,"The correct answer is **D: ኮሚቴው ከቦብ ድይለን ጋር ግንኙነት ለመፍጠር የሚያደርገውን ጥረት ያቆማል**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Sara Danius announced the committee is **stopping its efforts to reach Bob Dylan** regarding the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature because they are not getting a response. The quote ""A now we are doing nothing. I will call his closest associate and send an email and then we get very friendly responses. For the time being, that is enough."" directly supports this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በሥነ ጽሑፍ የኖቤል ሽልማት አሸናፊ** - This is a general topic, not what Danius specifically announced.
*   **B: ኮሚቴው ከተባባሪዎች ምንም አይነት ምላሽ አላገኘም** - The passage says they *are* getting friendly responses from his associates, not that they are getting no response at all.
*   **C: በሥነ ጽሑፍ የ2016 የኖቤል ሽልማት እጩዎች** - The passage doesn't discuss the nominees, only the winner and the difficulty in contacting him.



"
ማን ሊደርሰው ያልቻለም?,"The correct answer is **D: ቦብ ዳይላን**.

The passage clearly states that Sara Danius was unable to reach **Bob Dylan** to inform him about his Nobel Prize in Literature. The text says they haven't been able to get in touch with him (""komiteew, ቦብ ዲላንን ስለ በስነ ጽሁፍ የ2016 የኖቤል ሽልማቱን ስለማሸንፍ ማግኘት ስላልቻለ"")."
ቃል “ትልቅ እርምጃ” እንደሆነ የገለጸው ማነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ጎርደን ጆንድሮ**.

The text specifically states that ""የቡሽ ቃል አቀባይ ጎርደን ጆንድሮ የሰሜን ኮሪያን ቃል “የኮሪያ ባሕረ ሰላጤን እርግጠኛ የሆነ ከኒውክሊየር የማጽዳት ግብን ለማሳካት ትልቅ እርምጃ ነው” ብለዋል፡፡"" This means Gordon Johndroe is the one who called it a ""ትልቅ እርምጃ"" (big step).

The text states: ""ለስዊድን እና ለሌሎች 28 ሀገራት ከ1,000 በላይ የሚሆኑ ቴምብሮችን አምርቷል።"" which translates to ""He designed more than 1,000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries.""

በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ የታንኮቹ የአየር ማስወጫ ቀዳዳዎች ቀጣይነት ላለው ፍሳሽ ምክንያት ሊሆን የሚችለው ምንድር ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: የሙቀት መጨመር**.

The passage states: ""እሮብ ከሰዓት በኋላ ላይ፣ የታንኮቹ የአየር ማስወጫ ቀዳዳዎች ምናልባትም ታንኩ ውስጥ ካለው የሙቀት መጨመር የተነሳ እያፈሰሱ ነበር።"" (On Friday afternoon, the tank's vents were overflowing, possibly due to increasing heat inside the tank.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሁለተኛ ደረጃ መያዣ ቦታ እስከ አቅሙ ይሞላል** - The passage mentions the secondary containment *wasn't* full yet.
*   **B: መደበኛ የእሳት አደጋ መቆጣጠሪያ ሥርዓት ፍተሻ** - The inspection *caused* the initial leak, but isn't the reason for the vents overflowing.
*   **D: በፎርት ግሪሊ ፓምፕ ጣቢያ ላይ የእሳት ቃጠሎ ተከስቷል** - While the leak occurred near the Fort Greely pump station, there's no mention of a fire."
የማስተንፈሻ ቫልቮች ለምን ተከፈቱ?,"The correct answer is **B: ሥርዓት ፍተሻ ብኋላ የኃይል መቋረጥ ነበር**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""የኃይል ብልሽት የማስተንፈሻ ቫልቮች እንዲከፈትና በፎርት ግሪሊ ፓምፕ ጣቢያ 9 አቅራቢያ ድፍድፍ ዘይት ሞልቶ እንዲፈስ ምክንያት ሆኗል።"" (A power failure caused the vent valves to open and crude oil to spill near Fort Greely Pump Station 9).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በታንኮች ውስጥ የሙቀት መጨመር ተከስቷል** - While the passage mentions overheating later causing vent overflows, this wasn't the *reason* the valves initially opened.
*   **C: ታንኮቹ በሙሉ አቅም ላይ ነበሩ** - The passage states the tank could hold 55,000 barrels, but doesn't say it *was* full when the valves opened.
*   **D: የሁለተኛው ማጠራወምያ ቦታ በቂ በርሜሎችን መያዝ አልቻለም** - The secondary containment area wasn't full yet, so this wasn't a factor in the valves opening.

በአሁኑ ጊዜ በዘጠነኛው ክፍል ውስጥ ያለው ውሃ ምን ያህል ከፍተኛ ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ወገብ ላይ (waist-deep)**.

The passage states that the Ninth Ward is currently ""up to waist-deep in water"" because the levee is higher than it was during Hurricane Katrina. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 20 ጫማ (20 feet):** This was the flood height during Katrina, not the current water level.
* **B: 6 ኢንች (6 inches):** This refers to the amount of rain the Army Corps of Engineers estimates levees can withstand, not the current water level in the Ninth Ward.
* **D: 100 ጫማ (100 feet):** This is the width of the area where water is flowing over the levee, not the water depth in the Ninth Ward.



"
በካትሪና አውሎነፋስ ወቅት በዘጠነኛው ክፍል ውስጥ ምን ተከሰተ?,"The correct answer is **C: የጎርፍ ውሃ 20 ጫማ ከፍታ ነበረው**.

The text specifically states: ""በካትሪና አውሎነፋስ ወቅት እስከ 20 ጫማ ከፍታ ያለው በጎርፍ መጥለቅለቅ ያጋጠመው ዘጠነኛው ክፍል..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የጎርፍ ውሃ 100 ጫማ ስፋት ነበረ** - The text says the water *flowed* over a 100-foot section of the levee, not that the floodwater *was* 100 feet deep.
*   **B: ከወገብ በላይ የሆነ ውሀ ከግድብ በላይ ፈሰሰ** - This describes the *current* situation, not what happened during Katrina.
*   **D: የተበላሸውን ግድብ 6 ኢንች የሚሆን የዝናብ መጠን አልፏል** - This refers to the Army Corps of Engineers' assessment of the current levee, not the Katrina event.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Hamilton *confirmed* the patient was stable and had been in an area of Nigeria with Ebola cases. It also states the hospital *followed* infection control protocols to *prevent* potential infections.
* **What isn't confirmed:** The passage doesn't give any information about whether or not other patients *actually* contracted the virus. It only says protocols were in place to *prevent* it.  It's a potential risk, but not something the passage confirms has happened.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: በሽተኛው የተጓዘበት ቦታ (The patient's travel location):** The passage explicitly states the patient was in Nigeria.
* **C: ትክክለኛ ፕሮቶኮል ስራ ላይ ውሏል ወይ (Whether the proper protocol was enacted):**  The passage states the hospital *followed* protocols.
* **D: የበሽተኛው ወቅታዊ ሁኔታ (The patient's current condition):** The passage confirms the patient is *stable*.

የሳይንስ ሊቃውንት ለማወቅ የሚፈልጉት ነገር ምንድር ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: መሬት እንዴት ነው የተፈጠረችው (How Earth was formed)**.

Here's why:

The passage states scientists hope studying comets will help them understand ""how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed.""  That's the central question they're trying to answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኮሜቶች ከመሬት ጋር መቼ ተጋጩ (When comets collided with Earth):** While the passage mentions collisions, the *timing* of those collisions isn't the main focus - understanding the formation process is.
*   **B: ፕሮቲኖች እንዴት ነው የሚፈጠሩት (How proteins are made):** The passage mentions comets *might* deliver proteins, but understanding protein creation isn't the scientists' primary goal.
*   **C: ኦርጋኒክ ንጥረ ነገር ምንድን ነው (What organic matter is):**  The passage states comets contain organic matter, but it doesn't imply scientists are trying to *define* it - they are interested in its role in Earth's formation.

በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ የአከባቢው ፖሊስ በመዘጋቱ ውስጥ ምን ሚና ተጫውቷል?,"The correct answer is **C: ሞተረኞችን ወደ ሌሎች አማራጭ መንገዶች መሩ**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""80 police officers were present at the scene to direct motorists to an alternate route."" This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኤፍ.ቢ.አይ መዝጋቱን እንዲፈፅም አሳሰቡ** - While the FBI pressured the Maryland Transportation Authority to close it, the police *carried out* the direction by redirecting traffic.
*   **B: መዝጊያውን ለማድረግ ወሰኑ** - The passage states the *Maryland Transportation Authority* made the decision to close it under FBI pressure, not the police.
*   **D: አማራጭ መንገድ የትራፊክ መዘግየቶችን አሳውቀዋል** - The passage actually states there were *no* significant traffic delays on the alternate route.

በሚዘጋበት ጊዜ የቱቦ መግቢያዎችመግቢያዎች ምን ሆኑ?,"The correct answer is **B: እንደ ማሳለጫ ያገለግሉ ነበር**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""የጭነት መኪናዎች የቱቦ መግቢያዎች ን ለመግታት ያገለግሉ የነበረ ሲሆን..."" This directly translates to ""The tube entrances were used to block [something]"". The context clarifies they were used as a point to redirect traffic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ተዘግቶባቸው ንበር** - While they were eventually closed, the text first describes *what they were being used for* before the closure.
*   **C: ለሞተረኞችን ክፍት ነበሩ** - The opposite is true; they were being used to *redirect* drivers.
*   **D: ከፍተኛ የትራፊክ መጨናነቅ ነበር** - The text actually states the alternative route had *no* significant delays."

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ፎቶግራፍ አንሺው በሴፕልቬዳ ቡሌቫርድ ማዶ ላይ ተሽከርካሪውን አቁሞ መንገዱን ከማቋረጡ እና ከመቀጠሉ በፊት የፖሊስ ማቆሚያውን ፎቶግራፍ ለማንሳት በመሞከር የካሊፎርኒያ አውራ ጎዳና ላይ የትራፊክ ማቆሚያውን በመቆጣጠር ላይ የነበረ የፖሊስ መኮንን፣ ሁለት ጊዜ ወደኋላ እንዲመለስ ትእዛዝ እንደሰጠው..."" This directly indicates the photographer was taking pictures of the police checkpoint before being hit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage says the photographer was *told to move back* by a police officer, not that they were instructed to cross the road.
*   **B:** While true, this happened *before* the incident, not immediately before being hit.
*   **D:** The passage doesn't mention anything about the photographer getting a picture of Bieber.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states, ""ከትኩሳቱ እና ከደረቅ ጉሮሮ በስተቀር ጤንነት ይሰማኛል"" which translates to ""Except for the fever and sore throat, I feel well."" This directly contradicts the statement that he doesn't feel well.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: የደረቀ ጉሮሮ አለው (He has a sore throat)** - The passage confirms he *does* have a sore throat.
*   **C: በተረጋጋ ሁኔታ ውስጥ ነው (He is in a stable condition)** - The passage states ""ሁኔታው የተረጋጋ ነው"" (the situation is stable).
*   **D: ትኩሳት አለው (He has a fever)** - The passage confirms he *does* have a fever.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ትኩሳት የለውም** (He doesn't have a fever) - The passage says he *does* have a slight fever (""ከትኩሳቱ"").
*   **B: ለብዙ ሳምንታት በቤት ውስጥ ይሁናል** (He has been at home for many weeks) - The passage says he has been isolating for ""ብዙ ቀናት"" (many days), not weeks.
*   **D: ከባድ የቫይረሱ ተጠቂ ነው** (He is severely affected by the virus) - The passage states his case is ""መለስተኛ"" (mild).

Here's why:

The passage states "" እስከ ዛሬ ማለዳ ድረስ፣ ነፋሳት በሰዓት 83 ኪ.ሜ አካባቢ ነበር የሚጓዙት፣ እናም እየተዳከመ ይሄዳል ተብሎ ነበር የሚጠበቀው።"" (Until this morning, the winds were around 83 km/h, and it was expected to continue weakening). This directly indicates the time when it was predicted to continue weakening – *when* the wind speed was 83 km/h.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ማልዲቭስ ከመድረሱ በፊት** - The text doesn't specify a prediction of weakening *before* reaching the Maldives.
*   **C: የመጨረሻ ደረጃ ላይ ከመድረሱ በፊት** - The text doesn't mention anything about a ""final stage.""
*   **D: ነፋሱ በሰዓት ወደ 149 ማይል ከመድረሱ በፊት** - The text states the cyclone *reached* 149 mph, and the weakening prediction came *after* that point, at 83 km/h.

The passage explicitly states: ""የዘንባባ ቅጠል ሻንጣ (Tropical Cyclone Gonu) ተብሎ የተሰየመው ትሮፒካል ሳይክሎኔ ጎኑ፣ በሰዓት 240 ኪ.ሜ (በሰዓት 149 ማይል) ዘላቂ ነፋሶችን አገኘ።"" This means the cyclone *reached* sustained winds of 240 km/h.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: በሰዓት 149 ኪ.ሜ** - This is the speed in miles per hour, converted from the 240 km/h.
* **C: በሰዓት 149 ማይል** - This is the speed in miles per hour.  The question asks for the speed in km/h.
* **D: በሰዓት 83 ኪ.ሜ** - This was the wind speed *later*, as the cyclone was weakening, not at its peak."
ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ የካሬኒያ ብሬቪስ ባህርይ ተደርጎ የማይቆጠር የቱ ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ባለብዙ ሕዋስ ነው (is multicellular)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states that *Karenia brevis* is a **single-celled** marine microorganism (""ነጠላ ሕዋስ"").  Therefore, it cannot be multicellular.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: የአልጌ ዓይነት ነው (is a type of algae)** - The passage says *Karenia brevis* is an algae (""አልጌ"").
*   **B: የሰዎችን ነርቭ ሊያሰናክል ይችላል (can disrupt human nerves)** - The passage states the algae produces a neurotoxin that can affect nerves in both humans and fish.
*   **D: በተፈጥሯዊ ሁኔታ ይከሰታል (occurs naturally)** - The passage begins by stating *Karenia brevis* occurs naturally ("" በተፈጥሮ በሚከሰት"")."

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Natural conditions can interact with each other to create favorable conditions, which allows the algae to bloom."" This means *Karenia brevis* needs specific, favorable conditions to bloom – it doesn't bloom rapidly in *any* situation.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: የአሳን ነርቮች ያቆማሉ (Paralyzes fish nerves):** The passage says the algae ""produces a neurotoxin that can paralyze nerves in both humans and fish.""
* **C: ውሀን ተፅእኖ ለማድረግ (Affects the water):** The passage says the ""high concentration of toxins in the water often results in fish kills,"" implying it significantly impacts the water.
* **D: ኒውሮቶክሲን ያደርጋል (Produces a neurotoxin):**  The passage directly states that the algae ""produces a neurotoxin.""

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Thus far, no damage or **flooding** has been reported..."" This explicitly says there has been *no* flooding reported.  

The other options *are* mentioned in the passage:

*   **A: ጠቃሚ ዝናብ (Useful rainfall)** - The passage says the rainfall on Oahu was described as ""useful.""
*   **B: በመብረቅ የታጀበ ዝናብ (Rain accompanied by lightning)** - The passage states ""Some of the rain was accompanied by gusty winds and frequent lightning.""
*   **C: ተደጋጋሚ መብረቅ (Frequent lightning)** -  As above, the passage mentions ""frequent lightning.""

Here's why:

*   **The passage states the 6.34 inches of rainfall on Oahu was described as ""beneficial"" (ጠቃሚ), not that the rain *benefited* Oahu.** There's a slight but important difference. ""Beneficial"" is an adjective describing the rain, not an action the rain took on Oahu.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

*   **B:** The passage explicitly states Felicia weakened to a tropical storm before becoming a Category 4 hurricane with squalls.
*   **C:** The passage says the remaining traffic brought rain to ""most of the islands"" (አብዛኞቹ ደሴቶች).
*   **D:** The passage mentions some of the rain was ""accompanied by gusts and frequent lightning"" (በነጎድጓዶች እና ተደጋጋሚ መብረቆች የታጀበ ነበር).

The passage states ""ፒኬ ጁንየር ከ2009ኙ ግራንድ ፕሪክስ በኋላ ተባሯል።"" This directly reflects the outcome after the 2009 Grand Prix.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ፈርናንዶ አሎንሶ አደጋ አጋጥሞት ነበር** - The passage mentions Alonso was *involved* in an incident, but doesn't state he *suffered* an accident.
*   **B: ፒኬ ጁንየር አሸነፈ** - The passage states he *led* during a safety car period, but doesn't say he won the race.
*   **D: የደህንነት መኪናው አደጋ ደርሶበታል** - The passage describes the safety car being *deployed* due to an incident, not suffering damage itself."
አደጋው መቼ ተከሰተ?,"The correct answer is **A: ወዲያውኑ ከአሎንሶ ቀደም ያለ ማቁም በኋላ**.

The passage states the collision happened ""immediately after overtaking Fernando Alonso."" This directly answers the question ""When did the accident happen?"".

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ሌሎቹ መኪኖች ነዳጅ እየሞሉ ነበር** - This describes what happened *after* the accident, not when it happened.
* **C: የደህንነት መኪናው ከመምጣጡ በፊት** - The accident *caused* the safety car to come out.
* **D: ፒኬ ነዳጅ ለመቅዳት ከገባ በኋላ** - The text doesn't mention anything about Piquet Jr. needing to pit for fuel.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that researchers *previously thought* the creation of a new species would take a longer time, but the study found it happened in just two generations. This means the *actual time it took to create the species* was less than they originally believed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ስለ ዝርያው ሪፖርት ማድረግ:** The passage mentions the study was published on Thursday, but doesn't say anything about how long it took to *report* on the new species compared to expectations.
* **C: በተለያዩ ዝርያዎች መካከል መራባት:** The passage states the new species *resulted from* interbreeding, but doesn't suggest researchers underestimated how long that interbreeding would take.
* **D: የዝርያዎቹ ዝግመተ ለውጥ:** While evolution is happening, the passage specifically focuses on the speed of *speciation* (creating a new species), not the broader process of evolutionary change.

* **The passage states the study reports the *creation of a new finch species*** but **doesn't give the name of the new species**. It only identifies the two species that interbred to create it (bright-beaked Darwin's finch and the common cactus finch).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: አዳዲስ ዝርያዎች የተፈጠሩት የት ነበር** - The passage clearly states the new species arose on the **Galapagos Islands**.
* **B: የዝግመተ ለውጥ ሂደት ርዝመት** - The passage specifically highlights that the researchers found this process took **only two generations**, which was surprising because it was previously thought to take longer.
* **D: በመራቢያ ውስጥ የተሳተፉ ወፎች** - The passage names the two finch species involved in the breeding: **bright-beaked Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortis) and the common cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris)**.

The passage states that Bucharest will be the *first* city in Southeast Europe to host CowParade, and it specifically mentions the event taking place *in* Bucharest from June to August. While it's a large event, the text doesn't suggest it's happening across multiple Romanian cities or all of Southeast Europe."
ከሚከተሉት መግለጫዎች ውስጥ CowParadeን በትክክል የሚገልጸው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: በዓለም ላይ ትልቁ የሕዝብ ሥነ-ጥበባት ዝግጅት ነው**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""...የከብት ትዕይንት (CowParade)፣ ለማስተናገድ የመጀመሪያዋ ትሆናለች።"" and ""...በዓለም ትልቁ የሕዝብ ሥነ-ጥበባት ዝግጅት""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The text doesn't say CowParade only happens in ""innovative"" cities, just that Bucharest is using it to *present itself* as innovative.
* **B:** The CowParade wasn't *created* by the Bucharest city hall; the city hall is *hosting* it.
* **C:** While it's in Southeast Europe and during the summer, the text doesn't state it has been held across the entire region, only that Bucharest is the first to host it.



"
ሩሲያ የ II-76s አጠቃቀም እንዲታገድ ያደረገው ምክንያት ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: አደጋ**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""ሩሲያ ከዚያ አደጋ በኋላ Il-76ኤስን ለትንሽ ጊዜ አስቆመች"" (Russia temporarily grounded the Il-76 after the accident).  The accident, specifically the engine detaching, led to the grounding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ውስጣዊ ወታደሮች (Internal saboteurs):** While the text mentions investigation into potential sabotage, this didn't *cause* the grounding.
*   **C: የሶቪየት ጦር ኃይል (Soviet Air Force):**  The Il-76's history with the Soviet Air Force is background information, not a reason for the grounding.
*   **D: በሂደት ላይ የለ ምርመራ (Ongoing investigation):** The investigation happened *after* the grounding, not before. The grounding was a direct response to the accident, while the investigation aims to determine the cause.



"
II-76 ምንድር ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: አሮፕላን (Airplane)**.

The text states ""አውሮፕላኑ ወደ ኢርኩትስክ ሂዶ..."", and repeatedly refers to Il-76 as being involved in crashes and being used by the air force. This clearly indicates it's a type of airplane."
ለዘ ሲምፕሰንስ የፀሀፊዎች ቡድን የቀጠረው ማነው?,"The correct answer is **B: ሳይመን**.

The text states that Sam Simon was responsible for ""hiring the show’s first team of writers."""
ፍሉክ እንደምትለው፣ አዎንታዊ አስተያየቶችን እና ማበረታቻዎችን የላከላት ማን ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: ከሁለቱም ሴት እና ወንድ ወገኖች**.

The text specifically states that Fluke receives encouragement from ""both women and men."" This is the basis for her conclusion that her efforts weren't in vain.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ አንዳንድ ሰዎች ሴቶች ከመናገር እንዲቆጠቡ የሚፈልጉት ስለምን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **C: የሴቶች ጤና (Women's health)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Fluq concluded her attempt to get people to stop talking about women's health was unsuccessful. This implies that *some people* were trying to silence discussions *about women's health*.  The text doesn't give a reason *why* they wanted to do so, but the context makes it clear the topic they wanted suppressed was women's health.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ወንድ ወገኖች (Men):** The passage doesn't explicitly say men wanted to silence the conversation. It mentions encouragement *from* both men and women.
*   **B: የህክምና ወጪዎች (Medical costs):** There's no mention of medical costs in the passage.
*   **D: ፍሉክ (Fluq):** Fluq was the one *trying* to stop the conversation, not the target of the effort to stop it.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ የትኛው ፕላኔታዊ አካል በጣም ተለዋዋጭ ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ምድር**.

The passage states: ""እኛ እስከምናውቀው ድረስ ከታይታን የበለጠ ተለዋዋጭነትን የሚያሳየው አንድ የፕላኔቶች አካል ብቻ ነው ስሙም ምድር ነው"" which translates to ""As far as we know, there is only one planetary body that shows more variability than Titan, and that is Earth."" 

Therefore, according to the passage, Earth is the most variable planetary body."
ግልጽ የሆነ ፈሳሽ ያካተቱ ወንዞች እና ሀይቆች በየትኛው ፕላኔት አካል ላይ ተለይተዋል?,"The correct answer is **B: ቲይታን (Titan)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the planetary body being discussed (which is implied to be Titan) ""shows like water within it... you would be able to see the pebbles or gravel below."" This clearly indicates the presence of liquid on its surface, specifically resembling water. The text also contrasts it with Earth as being the only other body known to show such variability.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **ጁፕተር (Jupiter):** Jupiter is a gas giant and doesn't have a solid surface with rivers and lakes.
*   **ጸሃይ (Sun):** The Sun is a star composed of plasma, not a planet with liquids.
*   **ሳተርን (Saturn):** Saturn is also a gas giant, although it has rings and moons, it doesn't have surface rivers and lakes.



"
ከእነዚህ ግኝቶች ውስጥ በላባ ግኝት ያልተገኘው ምንድን ነው?,"Correct answer is **A: የእንስሳቱ ስብስብ ቀለም**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""ተመራማሪዎች ይህ የልጅ ዳይኖሰር ጭራ ቢሆንም፣ ናሙናው የአዋቂ ላባዎች ስብስብ እንጂ የዶሮ እንዳልሆነ ተናግረዋል።"" This means the collection of feathers was **not** from an adult animal. Thus the color of the animal's collection is unknown.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Laabaዎች በበረራ ውስጥ ጥቅም ላይ እንዳልዋሉ ግንዛቤ የሚሰጥ** - The passage explicitly states the feathers weren't structured for flight (""የላባዎቹ መዋቀር ለበረራ የሚውሉ ሳይሆን ለሙቀት መቆጣጠር ወይንም ለእያታ ነው።"").
*   **C: ወደ ላባ ዝግመተ ለውጥ ግንዛቤ** - The passage discusses how the feathers suggest the rachis (central shaft) evolved *after* barbs and barbules (""ራቺስ ከእነዚህ ሌሎች ባህርያት የቆየ ዝግመተ ለውጥ ውጤት እንደሆነ ይላሉ"").
*   **D: አብዛኞቹ ዳይኖሰርቶች ላባ እንደነበራቸው ማረጋገጫ አለ** - The opening sentence states this (""P: ይህ ዳይኖሰሮች ላባ እንደነበራቸው፣ የተስፋፋ ጽንሰ ሃሳብ፣ ብቻ ሳይሆን ነገር ግን ቅሪት አካላት ሊያቀርቡ የማይችሉትን እንደ ቀለም እና ባለ ሶስት ልኬት አቀማመጥ አይነት ዝርዝሮችንም ያረጋግጣል።"")."
የዳይኖሰር ላባዎች ያልነበራቸው ምንድን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **B: ራቺዎች (rachis)**.

The passage specifically states: ""የዳይኖሰር ላባዎች የዳበረ ራቺስ የሚባል ዘንግ ስለሌለው..."" (Dinosaurs' feathers didn't have a developed rachis, a central shaft...).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ባርቡልስ (barbules)** - The passage states dinosaurs *had* barbules.
* **C: የአዋቂዎች ስብስብ (a collection of adult feathers)** - The passage states the sample was a collection of adult feathers, not that they lacked this.
* **D: ከሥሩ ቀላ ያለ ቀለም (a color paler from below)** - The passage states the feathers were dark brown on top and light/whitish underneath, meaning they *had* a different color from below.



"
ስለ ZMapp ከሚከተሉት መግለጫዎች ውስጥ እውነት ያልሆነው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: አሁን ያሉትን በሽታዎችን ማከም ይችላል ነገር ግን ሞትን አይከላከልም**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states ZMapp hasn't been shown to *cure* existing diseases.** It only showed promise, but regular studies showed it was less effective than hoped for preventing death. It doesn't say it can cure diseases but *doesn't* prevent death.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

* **A: ከፀረ እንግዳ አካላት የተሰራ ነው (It is made of antibodies)** - The passage explicitly calls ZMapp a ""monoclonal antibody.""
* **C: በ PALM ሙከራ ውስጥ እንደ መቆጣጠሪያ ሆኖ አገልግሏል (It served as a control in the PALM trial)** - The passage states, ""ZMapp served as the control...""
* **D: ጥናቶች እንደሚያሳዩት ጥቅሙ በመጀመሪያ ከታሰበው ያነሰ ነው (Studies show its benefit is less than initially thought)** - The passage says studies showed it was ""less effective than hoped for preventing death.""



"
ከሚከተሉት መግለጫዎች ውስጥ የPALM ሙከራን በትክክል የሚገልጸው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: የቁጥጥር መድሐኒት ከሌሎች ሦስት ሕክምናዎች ጋር ተነጻጽሯል፣ አንደኛው ZMapp ነው** (A control medicine was compared with three other treatments, one of which is ZMapp).

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states: ""ZMapp served as the control...meaning researchers used it as a starting point and compared it to three other treatments.""  This directly matches option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage states ZMapp *didn't* show the benefit hoped for in regular trials, not that it showed *more* benefits than expected.
* **C:** While ZMapp *was* a starting point, it wasn't the only one. It was a *control* used *for comparison* against other treatments.
* **D:** The passage clearly says no treatment has yet proven effective at *curing* Ebola.



"
ተመራማሪዎች አዲሱ ቺፕ በጣም ጠቃሚ የሚሆነው የት ነው ብለው ያስባሉ?,"The correct answer is **A: ዝቅተኛ ገቢ ያላቸው አገሮች**.

The passage explicitly states that the researchers believe the chip could bring early detection of diseases like cancer, tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria to low-income countries, where rates are much higher than in wealthier nations."
የምርመራ መሣሪያውን ለመስራት ምን ዓይነት ዘዴ ጥቅም ላይ ይውላል?,"The correct answer is **B: መደበኛ የኢንክጄት አታሚዎችን**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states the device is made ""using standard inkjet printers"". While the resulting product *is* a printable chip (C), and the chips are small (A), the *method* used to create them is inkjet printing. Option D is too general.

Therefore, **B** directly answers the question of *how* the device is made."
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ስለ ሎቤት ሰርጦች የትኛው አባባል እውነት አይደለም?,"Correct answer: **D: ብዙዎቹ በጨረቃ ገጽ ላይ አልተገኙም**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""These ridges have been found across the Moon..."" This directly contradicts option D, which says they haven't been widely found.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

* **A: እነሱን የፈጠሯቸው ክስተቶች በቅርቡ የተከሰቱ ሳይሆኑ አይቀሩም** - The passage states they ""appear recently formed,"" suggesting recent events created them.
* **B: የእነሱ መገኘት ማለት ጨረቃ የሥነ ምድራዊ ዑደት አያጣም ማለት ነው** - The passage says the discovery ""challenges the idea that the Moon is geologically inert"" (meaning not active).
* **C: የጨረቃ ማንስውጤት ሊሆኑ ይችላሉ** - The passage refers to them as ""lunar lobate scarps,"" which implies they are features *on* the Moon's surface resulting from contraction.

በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ የመሬት ቅርጾችን በተመለከተ የትኛው ጽንሰ-ሐሳብ በጨረቃ ላይ የጂኦሎጂካል እንቅስቃሴ መኖሩን ያመለክታል?,"The correct answer is **D: የመሬት ቅርፆች በትክክል የተፈጠሩት በቅርብ ጊዜ ነው**.

Here's why:

The passage states the lunar swirls (the landforms) *appear* slightly disrupted, which *suggests* the geological events that created them were recent. This directly implies ongoing geological activity on the moon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ጨረቃ ቀስ በቀስ እየቀነሰች ነው** - While the passage mentions the moon is shrinking, it doesn't directly link this to the *recent* formation of the landforms.
*   **B: የመሬት ቅርፆች የተፈጠሩት ከረጅም ጊዜ በፊት ነው** - This is the opposite of what the passage suggests. The passage states the swirls are likely recently formed.
*   **C: በጨረቃ ገጽ ላይ የመሬት ቅርፆች አነስተኛ መጠን ብቻ ናቸው** - The passage doesn't discuss the *size* of the landforms, only their distribution and apparent age.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ክስ እስካልቀረበ ድረስ የማይኖረው ነገር ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ተጨማሪ አስተያየቶች (Additional comments)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Crown Office (the prosecution) ""will not give any comment to journalists until there is a formal indictment."" This directly means that additional comments/statements are withheld until the indictment is filed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: የፎቶ ህትመት (Photo printing)** - The passage discusses concerns *about* photo printing, but doesn't say it won't happen until an indictment is filed. It says courts view it as potentially prejudicial.
* **C: የዓይን ምስክር ማስረጃዎች ውይይቶች (Eye witness evidence discussions)** - The passage states that obtaining reliable eyewitness evidence is *already* a problem, regardless of the indictment.
* **D: የጽሑፍ ህትመቶች (Text printing)** - The passage focuses specifically on photo printing, not text generally.

በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ለመርከበኞች ወቅታዊ ችግር ያልሆነው ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: የበረዶ መጠን**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""እንደ ፒትማን ገለፃ፣ የበረዶው ግግር መጠንና ውፍረት ለባሕር ላይ መርከበኞች ላለፉት 15 ዓመታት ከነበረው የከፋ ነው።""  This directly says the *amount* of ice is the problem for sailors, making it worse than it has been in 15 years.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ከፍተኛ የአየር ሁኔታዎች (Severe weather)** - The passage says severe weather is *hindering* rescue efforts, but it's not the direct problem for the sailors themselves.
*   **C: የበረዶው ዉፍረት (Ice thickness)** - While mentioned alongside the amount, the passage emphasizes the *amount* of ice as the primary issue.
*   **D: የሚቀልጥ በረዶ (Drifting ice)** - The passage does not specifically mention drifting ice."
ከበረዶ በተጨማሪ የማዳን ጥረቶች ላይ ምን ተጽዕኖ እያደረገ ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: የአየር ሁኔታዎች**.

The text states: ""ከእጅግ ቀዝቅዛው በረዶው በተጨማሪ አደገኛ ከባድ የአየር ሁኔታዎች የማዳን ጥረቶችን እያስተጓጎሉ ናቸው።"" This directly translates to ""In addition to the extreme cold ice, dangerous severe weather is hindering rescue efforts."" 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የአቅርቦት ችግር (Supply problems):** The text doesn't mention any issues with supplies.
*   **C: የእርዳታ ችግር (Help/assistance problems):** While rescue efforts *are* facing problems, the text specifies the *cause* of the problems is the weather.
*   **D: ባህርተኞች (Sailors):** The text mentions the ice is worse for sailors, but doesn't say sailors are hindering rescue efforts.



"
Roberts የትኛውን እምነትን ከማፅደቅ የተቆጠበው?,"The correct answer is **C: የሕይወት መጀመሪያ**.

Here's why:

* The passage states Roberts *declined to state when he believes life begins* and that he felt it was *improper to comment on potential scenarios* regarding when life starts, especially in the context of abortion. This directly indicates he's avoiding taking a stance on the definition of when life begins.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ጉዳዮችን የመወያየት ሥነ ምግባር:** While he expresses a view on *when* to discuss the issue, he doesn't avoid discussing it entirely. He just doesn't want to give his personal belief on the start of life.
* **B: ወጥነት ያላቸው የጠቅላይ ፍርድ ቤት ውሳኔዎች አስፈላጊነት:** He actually *supports* the importance of precedent by reaffirming *Roe v. Wade* and highlighting the importance of established Supreme Court decisions.
* **D: የግላዊነት መብት:** He explicitly *confirms* his belief in the right to privacy as it relates to the *Roe* decision.



"
Roberts ለመወያየት በጣም ሥነ ምግባር የጎደለው የትኛው ርዕስ እንደሆነ ነው የተሰማው?,"The correct answer is **A: የጠቅላይ ፍርድ ቤት ውሳኔዎች ወጥነት (The consistency of Supreme Court rulings)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Roberts said it's improper to speculate on hypotheticals about when life begins, and that discussing that in the context of abortion ethics is improper. He then *immediately* reaffirms *Roe v. Wade* while highlighting the importance of adhering to established precedent (past Supreme Court decisions). This indicates he sees questioning the stability/consistency of Supreme Court rulings as a problematic and ethically fraught discussion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: የሮ ቪ. ዌድ ዉሳኔ (The Roe v. Wade decision):** Roberts *reaffirms* Roe v. Wade. He doesn't see it as a topic too ethically fraught to discuss; he defends it.
*   **C: በተዘዋዋሪ ግላዊነት የማግኘት መብት (The right to privacy):** Roberts explicitly states he believes Roe v. Wade was based on a right to privacy.
*   **D: የጉዳዮች ዝርዝር (The specifics of cases):** While the passage mentions cases, the core of Roberts' statement is about the *principle* of adhering to precedent and the danger of getting into philosophical debates about life's beginning when discussing abortion.



"
ሁለቱ የብርሃን ጨረሮች የት አሉ?,"The correct answer is **A: ወደ ሰማይ**.

The text explicitly states: ""ሁለት የብርሃን ጨረሮች በሌሊት ወደ ሰማይ አቅጣጫ እንዲጠቁሙ ተደርገው ተገጥመዋል።"" (Two beams of light were erected to point towards the sky at night.)"

Here's why:

The passage states: ""በስፍራው አምስት አዳዲስ ሰማይ ጠቀስ ፎቆች በመገንባት ላይ ሲሆኑ..."" which translates to ""Five new skyscrapers are **under construction** at the site...""  This clearly indicates the buildings are currently being built, not that the construction happened at a specific time like noon or 8:46 a.m. or at night.



"
ሰባቱ እህቶች ዋሻ መሆናቸውን የሚያሳየው ምን መረጃ ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: የሙቀት ልዩነቶች (Temperature variations)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""ታህተቀይ ምስሎች ከማታ እና ቀን የሙቀት ልዩነቶቹ ዋሻዎች እንደሚሆኑ ያሳያ።"" (Translated: ""Images show that the temperature differences between night and day indicate they are caves.""). This directly links the temperature fluctuations to the identification of the ""Seven Sisters"" as caves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: የዋሻው መግቢያዎች ዲያሜትር (Diameter of the cave entrances)** - While the diameter is mentioned, it doesn't *prove* they are caves, just describes a characteristic of them.
*   **C: የጂኦሎጂካል ጥናቶች (Geological studies)** - The USGS study is mentioned, but the *temperature variations* are the key finding presented as evidence.
*   **D: በምድር ላይ ያሉ የዋሻዎች ሥዕሎች (Images of caves on Earth)** - The passage states they are *similar* to caves on Earth, but it's the temperature difference that identifies *these* features as caves.



"
የሰባቱ እህቶች የሙቀት ልዩነቶቹ እንዴት ይታያል?,"The correct answer is **A: ታህተቀይ ምስሎች**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ታህተቀይ ምስሎች ከማታ እና ቀን የሙቀት ልዩነቶቹ ዋሻዎች እንደሚሆኑ ያሳያል።"" (Translation: ""Infrared images show the temperature differences between day and night as caves."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: በመሬት ውስጥ ጥልቅ ጉድጓዶች** - This describes *what* the features are, not *how* their temperature differences are observed.
*   **C: የዋሻዎቹ ዲያሜትር** - The diameter is a size measurement, not related to temperature observation.
*   **D: በምድር ላይ ያሉ ዋሻዎች ፎቶዎች** - The passage specifically mentions *infrared* images, not regular photos.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ከፍንዳታው ጉዳት ከደረሰበት በኋላ ታስሯል"" which translates to ""He was arrested *after* being injured by the blast.""  This directly contradicts option D, which states he wasn't injured.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

*   **A: በጥቃቱ ወቅት ተሽከርካሪ ተጠቅሟል** (A vehicle was used in the attack) - The passage says he used a ""ባለሶስት ጎማ ተሽከርካሪ"" (three-wheeled vehicle).
*   **B: ፈንጂ አፈንድቷል ይባላል** (He is accused of detonating explosives) - The passage states ""ቦምቡን በማፈንዳት የተጠረጠረው ሰውዬ"" (The man suspected of detonating the bomb).
*   **C: ብሔሩ በባለሥልጣናት ይታወቃል** (His nationality is known to authorities) - The passage says ""የዩጎርስ ብሄረሰብ አባል እንደሆነ ቢያውቁም"" (Although they know he is of Yugoslav nationality).



"
ባለሥልጣናቱ ጥቃቱን በተመለከተ ምን መረጃ አረጋግጠዋል?,"The correct answer is **B: የተጠርጣሪው ብሔር**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states, ""የዩጎርስ ብሄረሰብ አባል እንደሆነ ቢያውቁም..."" which means authorities have confirmed the suspect's nationality/ethnicity. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የማናቸውም ተባባሪዎች ማንነት** - The text doesn't mention anything about collaborators.
*   **C: ከጥቃቱ በስተጀርባ ያለው ተነሳሽነት** - The text doesn't say authorities know the motive.
*   **D: የተጠርጣሪው የመጀመሪያ እና የመጨረሻ ስም** - The text specifically says, ""ስሙ ለባለሥልጣናት እስካሁን አልታወቀም"" (his name is not yet known to authorities).

The passage states: ""ስፕሪንግቦክስ አውስትራሊያ በሚገጥምበት ጊዜ፣ የተከታታይ የመጨረሻ ግጥሚያ በሚቀጥለው ሳምንት ጆሃንስበርግ ውስጥ በሚገኘው ኤሊስ ፓርክ ውስጥ ይካሄዳል።"" 

""ስፕሪንግቦክስ"" is the nickname for the South African rugby team, and they will be playing against Australia at Ellis Park.



"
ስፕሪንግቦክስ ቀጣይ ግጥሚያቸውን የት ነው የሚጫወቱት?,"The correct answer is **C: ጆሃንስበርግ**.

The passage states: ""Springboks will face Australia when the final match of the series takes place next week at Ellis Park in Johannesburg.""

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states ""በጠፈር ጣቢያ ተልእኮው ቀደም ሲል ጋይሮስኮፕ ጠፍቶ የነበረበት"". This means a gyroscope was lost during the mission, causing a problem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ከግፊቶች ትክክለኛውን ርቀት መጠበቅ** - The passage mentions Chiayo and Sharipov maintaining a safe distance, but this wasn't a *problem* the station itself faced.
* **C: ጄት በማንሳት** -  The passage states Russian ground controllers *used* jets to restore the station's condition, it wasn’t a problem the station was having.
* **D: መደበኛ አመለካከትን መመለስ** - The station *did* maintain its orientation despite the gyroscope issue, and the jets were used to *restore* normal conditions, meaning this wasn't the initial problem.

* **The passage states the station maintained its orientation *until* the spacewalk was completed.** This implies completing the spacewalk was a key goal or event connected to the mission.
* The other options are incorrect:
    * **A: የጠፋ ጋይሮስኮፕ ማግኘት** - The passage says a gyroscope *had* failed, but doesn't suggest finding it was the mission's goal. It was a problem they overcame.
    * **B: ወደ አስተካካይ ትረስተሮቹ ግፊቶች መቅረብ** - Chiayo and Sharipov were at a *safe distance* from the truss, not approaching them as a primary mission objective.
    * **D: ጄቶች በማንሳት** - Launching jets was a corrective action to restore normal station operation, not the mission's overall goal.

ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ ስለ ጉዳዩ እውነት ያልሆነው የትኛው ነው?,"ትክክለኛው መልስ **B: የጥፋተኝነት ውሳኔ ተላልፏል** ነው።

የጽሑፉ እንደሚያመለክተው፣ ይህ ጉዳይ ለአይፈለጌ መልእክት ኢሜልን (spam) ለመከላከል ያለውን አስተሳሰብ ለመጀመሪያ ጊዜ ተቀባይነት እያገኘ ነው። ይህ ማለት ውሳኔ አልተላለፈም፣ ነገር ግን አዲስ ህግ ተግባራዊ ይሆናል ማለት ነው።

ሌሎች አማራጮች ትክክለኛ ናቸው፡-

*   **A: AOL ዋና መስሪያ ቤት በሆነበት ግዛት ተከሷል** - ጽሑፉ ፍርድ ቤቱ ጉዳዩን በቨርጂኒያ ውስጥ አይቶታል ምክንያቱም AOL በዚያ ግዛት ውስጥ ይገኛል።
*   **C: በጉዳዩ ላይ የአይፈለጌ መልእክት ኢሜልን የሚመለከት ህግ ስራ ላይ ውሏል** - ጽሑፉ 2003 የተደነገገውን ህግ በመጠቀም ትላልቅ ኢሜልን ለመከላከል ይተራል ማለት ነው።
*   **D: AOL እየተከሰሰ ነበር** - ጽሑፉ AOL ክሱን ያስጀመረችው ተጠቃሚዎች ሳጥኖች ላይ እንዲደረግ ተብሎ ነው።"
ከሚከተሉት መግለጫዎች ውስጥ ጉዳዩን በትክክል የሚገልጸው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: ክሱን AOL ነበር የጀመረው**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""The lawsuit was brought by the internet service provider AOL..."" (ክሱን ያስጀመረው የኢንተርኔት አገልግሎት ሰጪው ድርጅት AOL ነበር). This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: AOL ባልተፈለገ ስርጭት ተከሷል** - The passage states AOL *brought* the lawsuit, not that they were being sued for spam.
*   **B: ጉዳዩ ሁለት ግንባር ቀዳሚ የኢንተርኔት አገልግሎት አቅራቢዎችን ያካተተ ነበር** - The passage only mentions AOL and doesn't state the involvement of another major internet service provider.
*   **C: ጉዳዩ በ 2003 ነበር የተከሰሰው** - The passage states a law from 2003 was *used* in the case, but the case itself isn't said to have happened in 2003."
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ Vidal ከሦስት የውድድር ዘመኖች በፊት መጫወት የጀመረው ለየትኛው ክለብ ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ባርሳ**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""ቪዳል ከሶስት አመት በፊት ከሲልቪያ ባርሳን ተቀላቅሏል።"" (Vidal joined Sevilla Barça three years ago). This means he started playing for Barça three years ago.
"
ቪዳል ለባርሳ ስንት ጨዋታዎችን አድርጓል?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The text explicitly states: ""ቪዳል ለክለቡ 49 ጨዋታዎችን ተጫውቷል።"" (Vidal has played 49 games for the club.)"
በጨዋታው ላይ ተቃራኒ ቡድን ማን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **B: ቦሎኒያ**.

The text states ""እሁድ ከቦሎኒያ ጋር ሊደረግ ከታቀደው ጨዋታ በፊት"" (Before the game scheduled for Sunday against Bologna). This clearly indicates Bologna was the opposing team."
ጃርኬ በሆቴሉ ውስጥ ለምን ቆየ?,"The correct answer is **C: እሁድ ጨዋታ ነበረው**.

Here's why:

The text states ""እሁድ ከቦሎኒያ ጋር ሊደረግ ከታቀደው ጨዋታ በፊት በቡድን ሆቴል ውስጥ ቆየ"" - which translates to ""He stayed in the team hotel before the game scheduled for Sunday against Bologna."" This directly indicates he was staying at the hotel *because* of the upcoming game.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ልምምድ አድርጓል (He practiced)** - While he was training, the text specifies he was staying at the hotel *before* the game, not just for practice.
*   **B: የቅድመ ውድድር ዘመን ስብሰባ ነበረው (He had a pre-match meeting)** - The text doesn't mention a meeting.
*   **D: ከቦሎኒያ ጋር ጨወታ ነበርው (He was playing against Bologna)** - He *will* play against Bologna, but that's why he's staying at the hotel - it's a future event.

የጃካርታ ጂኦፊዚክስ ኤጀንሲ ለምን ማስጠንቀቂያ አይሰጥም?,"The correct answer is **D: ለመሬት መንቀጥቀጥ የሚፈለገውን መስፈርት አያሟላም**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""የሱናሚ ማስጠንቀቂያ አይሰጥም ፣ የጃካርታ ጂኦፊዚክስ ኤጄንሲ እንደገለጸው የመሬት መንቀጥቀጡ የ 6.5 መጠንን ስላላሟላ"" which translates to ""No tsunami warning was issued, as the Jakarta Geophysics Agency stated the earthquake did not meet the 6.5 magnitude requirement.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የሱናሚ ስጋት አልነበረም (There was no tsunami threat):** While true as a *result* of the magnitude, it's not the *reason* the agency didn't issue a warning.
*   **B: በነዋሪዎች ላይ ፍርሀትን ለማስወገድ (To avoid frightening residents):** The agency's primary concern is safety based on scientific data, not managing fear.
*   **C: በአካባቢያዊ ንግዶች ላይ ተጽእኖን ለማስወገድ (To avoid impacting local businesses):** This is not a reason a geophysics agency would withhold a warning.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ የመሬት መንቀጥቀጡ ምን አስከተለ?,"The correct answer is **A: የተደናገጡ የአካባቢው ሰዎች** (Terrified local residents).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that even though there was no tsunami threat, ""residents began to fear and leave their shops and homes."" This directly indicates the earthquake caused fear and displacement among the local people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: የሱናሚ አደጋ** (Tsunami disaster) - The passage explicitly states no tsunami warning was issued and there was no tsunami threat.
*   **C: የተሰጠ ማስጠንቀቂያ** (Given warning) - The passage says *no* warning was given.
*   **D: 6.5 በመጠን መለኪያ** (6.5 magnitude measurement) - This is a fact *about* the earthquake, but not what the earthquake *caused*. It explains *why* a warning wasn't given.



"
ከእነዚህ ውስጥ የፀሐይን እና የሌሎችን ከዋክብትን እንቅስቃሴ የሚያነሳሳው የትኛው ነበር?,"The correct answer is **A: የብርሃን እና የፕላዝማ ፍሰት**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...in the system the movement of all stars is governed not by reflection, by their rotation, or by anything else, but by the amount of light and plasma flow.""  This directly identifies light and plasma flow as the driving force.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the passage *mentions* the Rossby number, rotation, and magnetic flips, it explicitly says these are *not* what governs the motion. The Rossby number is a *result* of the light and plasma flow, not the cause.
* **C:**  Shimmering and brightness are related to light, but the passage specifically highlights *plasma flow* in addition to light.
* **D:**  This includes the Rossby number (which is a consequence, not a cause) and rotation (which the passage says isn't a governing factor).



"
የኮከብ ሮስቢ ቁጥር እንዴት ይወሰናል?,"The correct answer is **A: ብሩህነት እና ሽክርክሪት (Brightness and rotation)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""They used the star’s Rossby number, which is related to the amount of brightness and rotation along with a plasma flow.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: የፕላዝማ ፍሰት መጠን (Plasma flow rate):** While plasma flow is *related* to the Rossby number, it's not the sole determinant.
*   **C: የእንቅስቃሴ ደረጃ (Level of activity):** Activity is a *result* of the Rossby number, not a way to calculate it.
*   **D: የመግነጢሳዊ ተገላቢጦሽ መጠን (Magnetic reversal rate):** The passage states the Rossby number *relates* to magnetic reversals (lower Rossby number = less frequent reversals), but it doesn’t define how the number itself is calculated.

The text explicitly states: ""in the closing stages of the election, 29 percent of those polled believed Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible"".
"
እንደ ጁሊያ ጊላርድ አባባል አውስትራሊያ መቼ ነው ሪፐብሊክ መሆን ያለባት?,"The correct answer is **B: ከንግሥት ኤልዛቤት II የግዛት ዘመን በኋላ**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ጠቅላይ ሚኒስትር ጁሊያ ጊላርድ በ 2010 የፌዴራል ምርጫ ዘመቻ ወቅት ንግስት ኤልሳቤጥ II በንግሥና ማብቂያ አውስትራሊያ ሪፐብሊክ መሆን አለባት ብለው እንደሚያምኑ ተናግረዋል።"" This directly indicates Gillard believes Australia should become a republic *after* Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በተቻለ ፍጥነት** - While 29% of those polled believed this, it's not what Gillard stated.
*   **C: መቼም** - 31% believed this, but not Gillard.
*   **D: ከፌዴራል ምርጫ በኋላ** - The text doesn't link Gillard's belief to the election outcome."
የትኛው ድርጅት ነው በህግ ምርመራ ላይ ያለው?,"The correct answer is **B: የ Komen Foundation**.

The text states that the Komen Foundation has enacted a new law not to provide financial support or funding to organizations under legal scrutiny. It's the Foundation that is responding to the legal investigation, not the other options. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: በቤተሰብ ኢነርጂ እና ንግድ ኮሚቴ (Family Energy and Commerce Committee):** This committee is where Cliff Sterns held a position, but it's not *under* legal scrutiny.
* **C: ልጆችን በታለመ መልኪ ማሳደግ (Targeted parenting):** This is the *subject* of the investigation, not the organization being investigated.
* **D: የክትትልና የምርመራ ንዑስ ኮሚቴ (Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee):** This subcommittee is where Cliff Sterns was chairman, but not the organization under investigation.



"
ክሊፍ ስተርንስ የየትኛው ኮሚቴ መሪ ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: የክትትልና የምርመራ ንዑስ ኮሚቴ**.

The text states: ""በቤተሰብ ኢነርጂ እና ንግድ ኮሚቴ ሥር በሚተዳደረው የቁጥጥር እና ምርመራዎች ንዑስ ኮሚቴ ሊቀመንበር በነበረው ሚና ታክስ ውርጃዎችን በየታቀደ ወላጅነት በገንዘብ ለመደጎም የሚውል መሆን አለመሆኑን ስተርንስ እየመረመረ ነው።"" This clearly indicates that Cliff Sterns chaired the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ የስዊስዋን ሴት ላይ ያልደረሰው ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: የተሰረቁት እቃዎቿ ተመልሰዋል (Her stolen items were returned)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the police *returned* the mobile phone and laptop. This implies they were stolen *from* the Swiss woman.  The other options are things that *did* happen to her, according to the passage:

* **B: ተገድላለች (She was murdered)** - The passage states a woman was *assaulted*, which can be different from being murdered.
* **C: በ 5 ሰዎች ጾታዊ ጥቃት ተፈጽሞባታል (She was sexually assaulted by 5 people)** - The passage explicitly states she was sexually assaulted.
* **D: ስልኳ እና ላፕቶፗ ተዘርፈዋል (Her phone and laptop were stolen)** -  The passage confirms they were stolen.

The question asks what *didn't* happen to her, and the only thing from the options that didn't happen is that her stolen belongings remained lost. They were recovered."
በ2007 የታይዋን ብርቱ ሽልማት የተሸለመው የትኛው ኩባንያ ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: Asus**.

The passage states: ""ኤሰስ የ2007 የታይዋን ብርቱ ሽልማት ውስጥ በየቻይና ሪፐብሊክ አስፈፃሚ ዩዋን ከተሸለመ በኋላ..."" (Asus won the 2007 Taiwan Excellence Award from the Republic of China executor Yuan...).
"
ኤሰስ ኢኢኢ ኮምፒውተር ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: Laptop**.

Here's why:

The text states that after winning the 2007 Taiwan Excellence Award, the ""market for Asus laptops quickly diverged and changed."" This directly identifies the Asus Eee Computer as a **laptop**. 

The other options are incorrect based on the context provided:

*   **A: Smartphone** - The text doesn't mention smartphones.
*   **C: Tablet** - Tablets weren't prominent in 2007 as they are today, and the text focuses on laptops.
*   **D: Pager** - Pagers were already outdated by 2007.



"
ለጠፋው የፖስታ ሰነዶች ተጠያቂው ማን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **A: የፖስታ ቤት ሰራተኞች**.

Here's why:

The passage states the post office ""apologized to citizens and the media after discovering the concealment of over 600 postal items"". This directly implies the postal workers were responsible for the lost/hidden mail, including the 429 New Year's cards.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: የ Obanazawa ነዋሪዎች ብድን:** The residents *complained* about the missing cards, they didn't cause them to disappear.
* **C: ልጁ:**  The passage mentions a boy, but only in relation to the discovery of the hidden items, not as the cause of the problem.
* **D: ሚዲያው:** The media simply *reported* on the issue; they weren't responsible for the lost mail.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ የጎደሉትን ሰነዶች በተመለከተ ማን ይቅርታ ጠየቀ?,"The correct answer is **D: የ Obanazawa ፖስታ ቤት**.

The passage states, ""ትላንትና፣ ፖስታ ቤቱ ልጁ ከ600 በላይ የፖስታ ሰነዶችን... ለዜጎቹ እና ለሚዲያ ይቅርታውን አሳውቋል።"" This directly indicates that the Obanazawa post office apologized for the missing documents."
ዴል ፖትሮ የትከሻውን ጉዳይ መቼ መፍታት አስፈለገው?,"The correct answer is **C: በሁለተኛው ስብስብ ወቅት**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ፖትሮ በዚህ ጊዜ ለትከሻው ሕክምና አገኘ ግን ወደ ጨዋታው ለመመለስ ቻለ"" (Potro received treatment for his shoulder at this time but was able to return to the game). This happened *after* the score reached 6-6 in the second set, indicating the treatment occurred during the second set.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በመጀመሪያው ስብስብ ወቅት** - The passage doesn't mention any shoulder issues during the first set.
*   **B: ከመጀመሪያው መስበሪያ በፊት** -  The issue arose during the second set tiebreak.
*   **D: ከሶስተኛው መስበሪያ በፊት** - The passage only talks about the issue in relation to the second set."
የመጀመሪያው መስበሪያ ውጤቱ ምን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **A: በመጀመሪያው ዙር ውስጥ በ መስበሪያ ተሸንፏል (In the first round, a tie-break was lost)**.

The text states: ""ሙሬይ ሁለቱም ወንዶች እያንዳንዱን የተወረውን ኳስ ከያዙ በኋላ የመጀመሪያውን የአቻ መስበሪያ ተሸነፈ።"" (Murray lost the first tie-break after both men had won each point.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The text doesn't say Murray lost *because* of an injury to Del Potro.
*   **C & D:** The text focuses on the *first* tie-break, and mentions the second round briefly, but doesn't state who won it.



"
በምንባቡ ላይ እንደተገለጸው፣ በተለይ ለሕመምተኛው የተጋለጠው ማን ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: ልጆች (Children)**.

The passage states: “ዛሬ አንዳንድ ዕድሜያቸው ለትምህርት የደረሱ ሕፃናት ከሕመምተኛው ጋር የተገናኙ መሆናቸው ተለይቷል።” (Today, some school-aged children have been identified as having been in contact with the patient.)

This directly indicates that children are the ones who have been exposed."
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ገዥው ለቴክሳስ ዜጎች ሲናገር ምን ማረጋገጫ አልሰጠም?,"The correct answer is **D: ጉዳዩ ከባድ አይደለም**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the governor said ""ይህ ጉዳይ ከባድ ነው።"" (This matter is serious). Therefore, he *did not* assure citizens that the issue was *not* serious.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ስርዓቱ በጥሩ ሁኔታ እየሰራ ነው** - He stated ""ሥርዓታችን እንደሚፈለገው እየሰራ እንደሆነ ያረጋግጡ"" (Ensure our system is working as intended).
*   **B: የህዝቡን ደህንነት ለመጠበቅ ስራዎች እየተሰሩ ነው** - He stated steps were being taken to protect public safety.
*   **C: ፈተናውን ለመቋቋም የታጠቁ ናቸው** - He stated Texas was well-prepared to deal with the challenging situation.



"
በሁለት የቀድሞ የUW ተማሪዎች የተፈጠረው የትኛው የቀልድ የዜና ምንጭ ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: The Onion**.

The passage explicitly states that ""Heck and Johnson, while students at UW in 1988, came up with the idea to publish a satirical paper to lampoon news and news coverage."" and that ""The Onion was founded...""  It then goes on to describe The Onion's growth and content.

The other options are mentioned in the text as being shows *influenced* by The Onion's writers, not as the source itself."
በምንባቡ መሠረት፣ ከእነዚህ ውስጥ በ The Onion’s ዜናን በሚያዝናና መልኩ የሚያቀርብ ዘዴ ውስጥ ያልተካተተ የትኛው ነበር?,"The correct answer is **B: ፊልም**.

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions these formats as part of The Onion's approach to satirical news:

*   **ድር ጣብያ (Website)**: ""...a website attracting 5,000,000 unique visitors...""
*   **የህትመት እትም (Print publication)**: ""...to publish a print publication...""
*   **ዓለም አትላስ (World atlas)**: ""...our latest offering, the world atlas...""

The text **does not** mention The Onion producing films.

Therefore, **ፊልም (Film)** is the only option not included in the list of The Onion's satirical news presentation methods."
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ በፖሊስ ጥበቃ ሲደረግለት የነበረው ምንድን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **C: የ ዳውኒንግ መንገድ መግቢያ**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""The protest began opposite the police-guarded entrance to Downing Street, the Prime Minister’s official residence..."" This directly indicates the police were guarding the entrance to Downing Street.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ትራፋልጋር አደባባይን** - The protest *passed through* Trafalgar Square, but it wasn't being guarded by police as stated in the text.
*   **B: The Spring Forum** - This is where the Conservative Party was *going*, not something being guarded.
*   **D: The በግራንድ ኮኖት የሆቴል ክፍላቸው** - The protest went *past* the hotel, it wasn't being guarded."

The text specifically states: ""11:20 ላይ ፖሊሶች ተቋሚዎቹን ወደ እግረኛ መንገድ እንዲመለሱ ጠየቁ."" (At 11:20, police asked protestors to move to the pavement.) This directly answers the question."
በ ዶክተር ኢሁድ ኡር የተደረገው ጥናት እውነት ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: አንዳንድ የስኳር ህመምተኛ ያልሆኑ አይጦች አሁን የስኳር ህመምተኞች ናቸው**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""አሁን የስኳር በሽተኛ ያልነበሩ አሁን ግን የሆኑ የ4-ወር-ዕድሜ ያላቸው አይጦች አሉን"" which directly translates to ""We have 4-month-old mice that were not previously diabetic but now are.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage explicitly states Dr. Ur doubts the findings would benefit those *already* with type 1 diabetes.
* **B:** The passage states the *opposite* - mice that *were not* diabetic are *now* diabetic.
* **C:** Dr. Ur is skeptical about a cure, stating he ""doubts it could lead to a cure.""



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ዶክተር ኢሁድ ኡር ስለ ምን ተጠራጣሪ ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: ፈውስ የሚቻል ከሆነ**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""ዶክተር ኢሁድ ኡር ... የስኳር በሽታ ሊፈወስ የሚችል መሆኑን ይጠራጠራል።"" which translates to ""... Dr. Ihud Ur... doubts whether diabetes can be cured.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ግኝቶቹ ዓይነት 1 የስኳር በሽታ ላለባቸው ሰዎች ጠቃሚ ከሆኑ** - The passage says he recognizes the findings *aren't* helpful for those with type 1 diabetes.
*   **C: ሕክምናን በተመለከተ የሌሎች ባለሙያዎች አስተያየት** - The passage doesn't focus on other experts' opinions.
*   **D: የስኳር በሽታ የሌለባቸው አይጦች እንደዚያው ይቆያሉ** - The passage discusses mice *developing* diabetes, not remaining without it.

የበረራ ሲጂ4684 አደጋን በተመለከተ በትክክል ገለፃ የማያደርገው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: አውሮፕላኑ ከመከስከሱ በፊት ሶስት ጊዜ ለማረፍ ሞክሯል**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the plane **attempted to land twice** (""one attempt aborted"" and then ""before landing... a second attempt""). It does **not** say it attempted three times.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: አውሮፕላኑ መጀመርያ ላይ በአየር ሁኔታ ምክንያት ማረፍ አልቻለም ነበር** - This is true. The initial attempt was aborted.
*   **B: አውሮፕላኑ የተከሰከሰው በጣም ሩቅ በሆነ ቦታ ነው** - This is true. The passage says the crash site was discovered and two police officers had to descend into the bush to search, indicating a remote location.
*   **D: የአውሮፕላኑ አደጋ ቦታ ፍለጋ በአየር ሁኔታ ምክንያት ተስቶጓጉሏል** - This is true. The search was suspended due to the same bad weather that caused the failed landing.



"
በረራ ሲጂ4684 ማረፉን እንዲያቋርጥ ያደረገው ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: የአየሩ ሁኔታ መጥፎ ነበር**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""The botched landing was caused by the same bad weather that has hampered the search."" This directly links the failed landing to bad weather conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የማረፊያ ቦታው ተደራሽ አልነበረም** - While the wreckage was difficult to reach, the passage says the *landing* was botched, not that the runway was inaccessible initially.
*   **B: ከሲጂ4684 ቀድመው ሌሎች በርካታ አውሮፕላኖች ነበሩ** - The text doesn't mention any congestion or other planes.
*   **C: አውሮፕላኑ ወደ ኮኮዳ እንዲቀየር ተደርጓል** - The plane *was* trying to land in Kikonda, the change in destination isn't mentioned as a cause of the failed landing.

Here's why:

* The passage states ""አለ ከሞት የተረፈው ፍራንሲስዜክ ኮዋል።"" which translates to ""said the miraculously surviving Franciszek Kowa."" This clearly indicates he survived the event, meaning no harm ultimately came to him.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: መስኮት መስበር ቻለ** - While a window *did* break, the passage doesn't say Franciszek Kowa broke it.
* **C: ለመውጣት ሲሞክር ወንበር ሰበረ** - The passage says people were hitting the building with chairs, but doesn't say Franciszek Kowa broke a chair *while* trying to escape.
* **D: መስኮት ለመስበር ሲሞክር ጉዳት ደረሰበት** - The passage states he *survived*, implying he wasn't harmed while trying to escape through the window.

የዳኒኤል የትሮፒካል ማዕበል ተጽእኖን ለመለካት ለምን አስቸጋሪ ሆነ?,"The correct answer is **C: ማዕበሉ ከመሬት በጣም የራቀ ነው** (The hurricane is very far from land).

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states: ""አውሎ ነፋሱ ከመሬት ርቆ የሚገኝ በመሆኑ በዩናይትድ እስቴትስ ወይም በካሪቢያን ላይ ሊያስከትል የሚችለውን ተጽዕኖ ለመገምገም አሁንም አስቸጋሪ ነው።"" (Because the storm is far from land, it is still difficult to assess its potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ማዕበሉ ወደ አውሎ ንፋስ እንደሚጠናከር ተተንብዮአል** (The hurricane is predicted to strengthen into a storm) - While true, this doesn't explain *why* it's hard to assess the impact.
* **B: ሳይንቲስቶች ማዕበሉ ስለሚኖረው ቀጣይነት ያለው ንፋስ እርግጠኛ አይደሉም** (Scientists are not sure about the hurricane's continuing winds) - The passage doesn't mention uncertainty about wind speed.
* **D: ማዕበሉ ከማያሚ በጣም ርቆ ይገኛል** (The hurricane is very far from Miami) - The distance from Miami is just a detail; the key issue is distance from *land* generally.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ስለ ዳኒኤል የትሮፒካል ማዕበል ከሚከተሉት መግለጫዎች ውስጥ እውነት ያልሆነው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: ወደ መሬት ቅርብ ነው**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the storm is 3000 miles from Miami, Florida, and that it's difficult to assess its impact on the US or the Caribbean *because* it is so far from land. This directly contradicts the statement that it is close to land.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

*   **A: በካሪቢያን ላይ ያለው ተጽዕኖ አይታወቅም** - The passage says it is too early to assess its impact on the Caribbean.
*   **B: የተፈጠረው በአትላንቲክ ውቅያኖስ ውስጥ ነው** - The passage clearly states it formed in the North Atlantic Ocean.
*   **C: ወደ አውሎ ነፋስ ሊቀየር ይችላል** - The National Hurricane Center predicts Danielle could become a hurricane."
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ዓለም አቀፍ ወረርሽኝ ከማስከተሉ በፊት በሽታው ምን መሆን አለበት ተብሎ የተጠቆመው?,"The correct answer is **A: ገዳይነቱ ማነስ አለበት**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""አንዳንድ ጥናቶች እንደሚያመለክቱት በሽታው ዓለም አቀፍ ወረርሽኝ ከመሆኑ በፊት ገዳይነቱ ያነሰ መሆን አለበት"" - which translates to ""Some studies suggest that the disease should be less deadly before it becomes a global pandemic.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ምልክቶቹ ቀላል ሆነው መቀጠል አለባቸው** - The passage expresses concern that *mild* symptoms could *increase* spread, not that they should continue.
*   **C: ብዙ ሰዎች መያዝ አለባቸው** - The passage doesn't say the disease *should* infect many people; it expresses concern about potential spread.
*   **D: ህጻናት ምልክቶች ማየት አለባቸው** - The passage actually states children are being reported as infected *without* showing symptoms, which is a concern.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ኃይለኛ አውሎ ነፋሱ ከፉጂያን ምን ያህል ይርቃል?,"The correct answer is **B: 11 ኪሎሜትሮች**.

The passage states: ""ኃይለኛው አውሎ ነፋስ ወደ ቻይኛ በአስራ አንድ ኪሜ በሰዓት እንደሚጓዝ ይገመታል።"" This means the storm is *moving* at 11 kilometers per hour, not that it is 11 kilometers away. However, the question asks how far the storm is *estimated to travel* within China, which is given as 11 kilometers.

The passage also states the storm was 7 kilometers from the Fujian province, but the question specifically asks about the *speed* it is moving towards China.
"
ጆርጅ ቡሽ እስያ ሲደርሱ ሰላምታ የሰጣቸው ማነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ዊን ካን ሴንግ እና ሊ ሄይን ሎንግ**.

Here's why:

The passage states that George Bush was welcomed by Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister **Win Kan Seng** and had discussions with Prime Minister **Lee Hsien Loong**. Therefore, both of them greeted him.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ጠቅላይ ሚኒስትር** - While he *met* with the Prime Minister, the passage specifies he was *welcomed* by the Deputy Prime Minister as well.
*   **B: ታዳሚ** - He spoke *to* an audience, but they didn't greet him upon arrival.
*   **D: ምክትል ጠቅላይ ምኒስቴሩ** - While Win Kan Seng welcomed him, Lee Hsien Loong also had discussions with him - making this incomplete.



"
ፕሬዝዳንቱ ስለ እስያ የንግድ መስፋፋት የተናገሩት መቼ ነበር?,"The correct answer is **C: የአጋማሽ ዘመን ምርጫውን ሽንፈት ተከትሎ**.

The text states: ""በአጋማሽ ምርጫው ከሳምንት ሽንፈት ቡሃላ፣ ቡሽ በእስያ ውስጥ ስላለው የንግድ ሥራ መስፋፋት ለታዳሚዎች ተናግሯል፡፡"" This directly links his speech about expanding trade in Asia to *after* the midterm election loss.

በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ የመንግስት አጠቃላይ ግብ የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ተጨማሪ 1,300 የጭነት መኪናዎችን መግዛት (To purchase an additional 1,300 trucks)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the increase of 300 trucks *brings the total to 1,300*. This means the government's goal is to have a total of 1,300 trucks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't mention covering costs, only acquiring trucks.
* **B:** While 300 trucks *are* being added, the overall goal isn't just to buy 300. It's to reach 1,300 total.
* **D:** The passage describes *acquiring* trucks, not reducing the number of trucks.



"
መንግሥት ምን አሳወቀ?,"The correct answer is **A: ለተጨማሪ 300 የጭነት መኪናዎችን የገንዘብ ድጋፍ ለማድረግ አቅደዋል (They plan to financially support an additional 300 trucks)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ያደረገውን ቁርጠኝነት ያራዝመዋል (extends its commitment)... አንድ የ300 ጭማሪ (an increase of 300)...""  This directly indicates a plan to add 300 more trucks with government support.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: የጭነት መኪናዎችን ችግር ለመቅረፍ ቆርጠዋል (They are determined to solve the truck problem):** While implied, the passage specifically announces *how* they're trying to solve the problem (by adding trucks), not just that they're determined to solve it.
* **C: ለተጨማሪ 1,300 የጭነት መኪናዎች የገንዘብ ድጋፍ ለማድረግ አቅደዋል (They plan to financially support an additional 1,300 trucks):** The passage states the *total* will be 1,300, not that they are adding 1,300 new ones.
* **D: የመጨናነቅ ችግሩ እስከ መጋቢት ድረስ መፍትሄ ያገኛል (The congestion problem will be solved by Megabit):** The passage only mentions Megabit as the time the trucks will be *added*, not that the problem will be solved by then.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ምን መረጃ ይታወቃል?,"The correct answer is **A: የስጋት ደረጃው ቀንሷል**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...but reducing the threat level to severe does not mean the overall threat has disappeared."" This directly indicates that the threat level *has* been reduced.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: ከእንግዲህ ስጋት የለም (There is no more concern):** The passage explicitly says the threat hasn't *disappeared*, only that the level has been reduced.
    * **C: ጥቃት እየተተበቀ ነው (An attack is happening now):** The passage refers to a *potential* future attack, not one currently in progress.
    * **D: ጥቃቱ ከባድ እንደሚሆን የደህንነት ምንጮች አረጋግጠዋል (Security sources have confirmed the attack will be severe):** The passage states there's ""no information indicating an attack is imminent,"" which is the opposite of confirmation.

Therefore, the only statement supported by the passage is that the threat level has been reduced."
ተቃውሞውን በተመለከተ የትኛው መግለጫ እውነት አይደለም?,"The correct answer is **C: የተቃውሞ ሰልፎች የቀደመውን የCEP ስራ ለመልቀቅ ጠይቀዋል**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the Presidential Commission's formation was *in response* to the protests and that the commission recommended *dissolving the previous CEP*. It doesn't mention the protesters specifically demanding the CEP's resignation. The commission acted *because* of the protests, not *at the behest* of protesters directly demanding the CEP's removal.

Let's look at why the other options are true:

*   **A: የፕሬዚዳንቱ ኮሚሽን ለተቃውሞው ምላሽ ነው** - This is directly stated in the text. (""The commission was a response to the widespread anti-government protests…"")
*   **B: በጊዚያቸው ያልተካሄዱ ምርጫዎች ህዝባዊ ተቃውሞውን ቀስቅሷል** - The passage mentions the protests stem from the lack of elections since 2011.
*   **D: ተቃውሞዎቹ አንዳንድ ጊዜ ሁከት የሚፈጥሩ ነበሩ** - The passage describes the protests as ""sometimes violent peaceful demonstrations"".



"
የመጨረሻው CEP ስራ እንዲለቅ ማን ሀሳብ አቀረበ?,"The correct answer is **C: የፕሬዚዳንቱ ኮሚሽን**.

The text states: ""The commission had called for the previous CEP to be dissolved as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections."" This clearly indicates the Presidential Commission proposed the dissolution of the previous CEP.

በመግለጫው መሰረት ናሳር በአትሌቶች ላይ ያደረሰውን በደል ተከትሎ በUSA ጂምናስቲክስ ያልተደገፈው ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: የእውቅና ማረጋገጫ መንጠቅ (Revoking of Safe Sport recognition)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that USA Gymnastics ""accepts the need for meaningful change within our organization...to better serve our athletes and clubs."" This directly implies a prior lack of adequate safeguards (and therefore recognition of those safeguards) before the Nassar abuse came to light.  The passage also details support for an independent investigation and accepting necessary changes – things they wouldn’t need to *accept* if they were already doing them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ደጋፊ የሆነ አከባቢን መፍጠር (Creating a supportive environment):** The passage states they *aim* to create this environment, but it doesn't say they were doing so before the Nassar revelations.
*   **C: በድርጅቱ ውስጥ አስፈላጊ ለውጦች (Necessary changes within the organization):** They *agree to* make these changes, meaning they weren't in place previously.
*   **D: ገለልተኛ ምርመራ (Independent investigation):** They *support* an investigation, suggesting they hadn't conducted one adequately before.

በምንባቡ መሠረት የሁለቱም USA ጂምናስቲክስ እና የዩናይትድ ስቴትስ ኦሊምፒክ ኮሚቴ ወደፊት የሚያራመዱበት ዋና ግብ ምንድር ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: ለአትሌቶች ደህንነቱ የተጠበቀ አካባቢን ማሳደግ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""የዩ.ኤስ.ኤ ጂምናስቲክስ እና USOC ተመሳሳይ ግቦች አሏቸው — የጂምናስቲክስ እና ሌሎች ስፖርቶች በተቻለ መጠን ህልማቸውን ለሚከተሉ አትሌቶች የተጠበቀ፣ አውንታዊ እና አበረታች አካባቢ ማድረግ."" (USA Gymnastics and USOC have the same goals – to make gymnastics and other sports a safe, positive and encouraging environment for athletes pursuing their dreams to the fullest extent possible.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የበላሪ ናስርን በደል ማሳወቅ** - While the passage acknowledges the abuse, the goal isn't *just* to publicize it, but to prevent future occurrences.
*   **B: የእውቅና ማረጋገጫ መንጠቅን መጀመር** - This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **C: የግል ምርመራን መጀመር** - The passage supports an *independent* investigation, but that's a *step* toward the goal of safety, not the goal itself.



"
ክስተቱ ሲከሰት መርከቡ ወዴት እየሄደ ነበር? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

The text states: ""The volunteer mining vessel was en route to Puerto Princesa *in Palawan* when the incident occurred."" This directly answers the question of where the ship was headed when the incident happened.

Here's why:

The passage states the ship is the *seventeenth* warship assigned to the U.S. Navy, not the seventh. The other options are all directly stated as true in the text:

*   **A:** The ship was traveling *towards* Puerto Princesa.
*   **B:** The ship was located *in* Palawan.
*   **C:** The ship is described as a charitable mining vessel.



"
ለዩ.ኤስ. ወታደሮችን በተመለከተ መግለጫውን የሰጠው ማን ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: የፕሬስ ጻሃፊ**.

The text states the announcement was given ""through the press secretary."" While Trump made the decision, the *announcement* itself was delivered by his press secretary.
"
በመግለጫው መሰረት የታሰሩ ተዋጊዎችን የመጠበቅ ሃላፊነት የወሰደው የትኛው ሀገር ነበር?,"The correct answer is **D: ቱርክ**.

The text explicitly states that the announcement said Turkey would take responsibility for guarding the captured ISIS fighters. 

Here's the relevant part of the text: ""መግለጫው ቱርክ የተያዙትን የአይ ኤስ ተዋጊዎችን ጥበቃም ትረከባለች ብሏል።"" (The announcement also said that Turkey would guard the captured ISIS fighters.)"
የአደጋው መንስኤ ምን እንደሆነ ይታመናል?,"The correct answer is **B: እሳት**.

The passage states: ""...due to dangerous **fire** is believed to be the cause.""

While the terrain and weather made rescue difficult, the *cause* of the crash is believed to be fire.
"
አደጋው የተከሰተው በምን ዓይነት የመሬት አቀማመጥ ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: ተራራማ**.

The passage states: ""አደጋው በተራራማው የመሬት አቀማመጥ ከፍ ብሎ የተከሰተ"" which translates to ""The accident occurred in a mountainous terrain."""
በጎርፉ ምክንያት ባለስልጣናት ምን ተስፋ እያደረጉ ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: የአሸዋ ሜዳዎችን እድሳት (Restoration of sandbars)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ምንም እንኳን የውሃው መጠን ከጎርፉ በኋላ ጥቂት ጫማዎችን ብቻ የሚያድግ ቢሆንም፣ ባለሥልጣኖቹ የተሸረሸሩ አሸዋዎችን ወደታች ለመመለስ በቂ ይሆናል ብለው ተስፋ ያደርጋሉ።""  This directly translates to ""Even though the water level after the dam only fills a few shoes, authorities hope it will be enough to restore the eroded sandbars.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: የባህር ዳርቻዎች መፈጠር (Creation of shorelines):** While sandbars contribute to shorelines, the passage focuses specifically on restoring the *existing* sandbars, not creating new shorelines.
*   **C: ቁጥራቸው ብዙ የሆነ ሃምፕባክ ቹብን (A large number of humpback chub):** The passage says the humpback chub is *endangered* due to the dam, not that authorities hope for a large number of them.
*   **D: ተጨማሪ የዱር እንስሳት መኖሪያዎች (More wildlife habitats):**  The dam *removed* habitats, and the authorities are trying to restore a specific habitat (sandbars) as a step towards potentially improving wildlife conditions, but it's not the direct hope stated in the passage.



"
ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ የግድቡ ግንባታ ለዘለቄታው የነካው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: የአሸዋ ሜዳዎችን (Ashwa Meddas)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""This sediment was necessary to create sandbars and shorelines...""  The dam stopped the sediment flow, directly impacting the formation of sandbars.
* **Permanent Impact:** The loss of sediment *permanently* altered the creation of these features.  While the passage suggests efforts to restore them, the initial impact was a lasting change.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ሃምፕባክ ቹብን (Hampback Chub):**  The chub is *affected* by the dam, but it's not the *thing* directly and permanently changed. It's a species at risk *because* of the change.
* **C: የዱር እንስሳት መኖርያ (Dur Enisat Menoria):**  The sediment *created* habitats, but the habitat loss is a consequence of the change to the sandbars and shorelines.
* **D: ሰፊ ደለል (Sefi Delell):** The passage mentions the dam stopped the sediment (""delell"") from reaching the river, but the sandbars are the enduring change.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ሊደርሱ ስለሚችሉ ጥቃቶች ለዩናይትድ ስቴትስ መረጃ የሰጠው ማን ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ያልተገለፀ ምንጭ (An unnamed source)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""አሜሪካ በኢትዮጵያ እና በኬንያ ውስጥ “ታላላቅ ምልክቶችን” አጥፍቶ ጠፊ የቦምብ ጥቃቶችን በመጠቀም የሚገልጽ ከማይታወቅ ምንጭ የተቀበለው መረጃ እንዳገኘ ገልጿል።"" (America said it had received information from an unknown source describing possible suicide bombings targeting ""high-profile"" locations in Ethiopia and Kenya).

The passage doesn't specify *who* the unnamed source is, only that the information came from an unknown source. It doesn't attribute the threat to the Somali extremists themselves *as the source of the intelligence*, but rather as the potential perpetrators.



"
ከሚከተሉት መግለጫዎች የተጠረጠረውን የአክራሪዎችን የጥቃት እቅድ በትክክል የሚገልጸው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: በሁለት አገሮች ጎልተው የሚታወቁ ቦታዎች ቦንቦችን ማፈንዳት** (In two countries, bombing prominent places).

Here's why:

* **The passage states the embassy warned of plots in *both* Kenya and Ethiopia.** This eliminates options A and D which refer to only one country.
* **The passage specifies ""high-profile targets"" (ታላላቅ ምልክቶች)**. This means the attacks are planned for well-known locations, making option C the most accurate description.
* Option B is too broad, it just says “in two countries” without mentioning the nature of the targets.

Therefore, option C is the only one that accurately reflects both the geographic scope *and* the type of targets mentioned in the passage."
ከሚከተሉት ሰዎች ውስጥ ጠበቃ ያልሆነው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: ማኪስ ትሪያንታፊሎፖውሎስ**.

Here's why:

*   **ፔትሮስ ማንቶቫሎስ** is described as a ""member of parliament and a legal professional"" (lawyer).
*   **ሳኪስ ኬቻጂዎግሉ** is explicitly stated to be a lawyer (""lawyers"").
*   **ጆርጅ ኒኮላኮፕለስ** is explicitly stated to be a lawyer (""lawyers"").
*   **ማኪስ ትሪያንታፊሎፖውሎስ** is identified as a journalist. He reported the information on television, but is not described as having any legal training.

በግሪክ ህጋዊ ማህበረሰብ ውስጥ ያለው ቅሌት አካል ሆኖ ያልተጠቀሰው የሰዎች ብድን የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ነገረ ፈጆች (Notaries)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions:

*   **ዳኞች (Judges):** Several judges are implicated (Kalosis is imprisoned, and there's a general mention of judges' illegal activities).
*   **ጠበቆች (Lawyers):** Sakis Kechadjoglou and George Nikolaoupolos (lawyers) are imprisoned, and the passage speaks of lawyers being involved in illegal acts.
*   **ጋዜጠኞች (Journalists):** Makis Triantafyllopoulos is mentioned for breaking the story.

However, the passage states that ""ዳኞች፣ ጠበቆች፣ የተከሳሽ ጠበቃዎችና አቃቢ ሕጎች የሰሯቸው ሕገወጥ ስራዎች መጋለጣቸውን ተከትሎ..."" This list *excludes* **ነገረ ፈጆች (Notaries)**. While not explicitly stated they are untainted, they are the group *not* included in the list of those whose actions triggered the scandal. Therefore, they are the group that would be part of the upheaval in the legal community but haven't been directly mentioned as involved.



"
በህንድ ስንት ዊኬቶች ጠፉ?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The passage states: ""However, after losing the captain's wicket, India lost 36 runs and **7 wickets** until the end."" 

Therefore, 7 wickets fell for India."
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ የኢኒንግስ ከፍተኛው ነጥብ ምን ነበር?,"The correct answer is **A: 70 ሩጫ**.

The passage explicitly states: ""ሮቢን ኡታፓ፣ ... የኢኒንጉን ከፍተኛ ውጤት 70 ሩጫዎችን አስመዘገበ።"" (Robin Uthappa, ... scored a high of 70 runs for the innings)."
ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ አደም ኩርደን ብስጭት መንስኤ ያልሆነው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: በዌልስ አለመሰማት**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Kurden was upset because Wells *pretended* to be listening, but wasn't actually taking their concerns seriously. This is different from Wells not hearing at all. Kurden's frustration is with the *deception* of being heard, not a literal inability to hear.

Let's look at why the other options *are* causes of Kurden's frustration:

*   **A: ወሲባዊ ይዘትን በተመለከተ የጣቢያው አዲስ መመሪያ** - The passage directly links the community's outrage (and Kurden's frustration) to the attempt to loosen the policy on sexually explicit content.
*   **B: የዌልስ ጥበብ ስረዛ** - Kurden expresses direct anger about the artwork being deleted.
*   **D: ስለ ጥበብ መጥፋት ምክንያት ውሸቶች** - Kurden specifically calls out Wells for lying about the reasons for the deletion (""First, pretending it was for legal reasons. Second, pretending they were listening to us."").



"
በምንባቡ መሠረት ከጣቢያው ምን ጠፋ?,"The correct answer is **B: ወሲባዊ ይዘት**. 

Here's why:

The passage states the controversy stems from an attempt to ""tighten the policy regarding sexually explicit content"" on the site. The quote from Adam Kurden implies that the site was hosting ""millions of clearly licensed media"" and the current debate revolves around how to handle such content. This points to the removal or attempted removal of sexually explicit content from the site.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ አሚር ካሃን የማይደግፈው የትኛውን ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: በኦሎምፒክ ውስጥ ያሉ ሴት ተዋጊዎችን ጨምሮ (Including female fighters in the Olympics)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states Amir Kahn believes ""women shouldn't fight"". While he supports British competitors in the 2012 Olympics, his statement clearly indicates he doesn't support the *inclusion* of women in combat sports within the Olympics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: የብሪታንያ ተወዳዳሪዎች (British competitors):** He explicitly states he *will* support them.
* **C: የሴቶች አስተያየት (Women's opinion):** The passage doesn't mention his stance on women's opinions.
* **D: ለንደን ኦሎምፒክን ማስተናገድ (Hosting the London Olympics):**  He doesn't express any opposition to London hosting the Olympics.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ አሚር ካሃን የግል አስተያየቱ ቢኖርም የሚደግፈው የትኞቹን ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: የ 2012 ኦሎምፒክ**.

Here's why:

The passage states Amir Kahn said he would support the **English competitors at the 2012 Olympics in London**, despite his personal beliefs about women competing. This directly indicates his support lies with the 2012 Olympics and its competitors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሴት ተዋጊዎች (Female fighters):** While the passage mentions the debate around women's inclusion, Amir Kahn specifically states his *personal* view is against it, not that he supports female fighters.
*   **B: ከ 2004 ኦሎምፒክ ጋር አብረው የነበሩት ተወዳዳሪዎች (Competitors from the 2004 Olympics):** The passage doesn't mention any support for those he competed with in 2004.
*   **D: ሌሎች የብር ሜዳሊያ አሸናፊዎች (Other silver medal winners):** The passage focuses solely on his support for the 2012 Olympics.

ፒተር ሌንዝ መቼ ነበር የሞተው?,"The correct answer is **C: ሆስፒታል ዉስጥ**

Here's why:

The text states Peter Lenz was taken to a local hospital after the accident and ""later died."" While he was injured on the track, the actual death occurred at the hospital.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በማሟሟቅ ግዜ** - He was injured during the final lap, but didn't die *at that moment*.
*   **B: ከሞተር ላይ ከወደቀ በኋላ** - He fell off the bike, but that wasn't when he died. He was hit by another rider *after* falling.
*   **D: በክትትል ላይ ከሚገኙ የሕክምና ባለሙያዎች ጋር ሳለ** - The text says medical personnel *attended* to him, but doesn't state he died while they were with him. They transported him to the hospital."
ዣቪየር ዛያት ማነው?,"The correct answer is **B: ሌላ ሯጭ (another racer)**.

The passage states that Xavier Zayat ""ተመታ (hit)"" Peter Lenz after he fell off his bike. This indicates Zayat was also racing, not a doctor, medic, or rescuer."
በየትኛው ሁኔታ ውስጥ አንድ የተጨነቀ ተጓዥ የአውሮፕላኑን ውስጣዊ አሠራር በመረዳት ተጠቃሚ ሊሆን የሚችለው?,"The correct answer is **B: ለመብረር ያላቸው ጥላቻ የማያዉቁትን በመፍርሃት ላይ ያተኮረ ከሆነ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...for some people, understanding how a plane works and what is happening during a flight can help to confront a fear based on the unknown or lack of control.""  This directly addresses the idea that fear stemming from a *lack of knowledge* about how planes work can be alleviated by gaining that knowledge.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ተሳፋሪው በፍርሃቱ ካፈረ:** While understanding can *help* manage fear, the passage doesn't say it's beneficial when someone is completely overwhelmed.
* **C: ተሳፋሪው ለሁሉም ዓይነት መጓጓዣዎች ፍርሀት ካለው:** The passage specifically focuses on fear of *flying*, not a general fear of all transportation.
* **D: ጭንቀታቸው ከበረራ ጋር ያልተያያዙ አሰቃቂ ክስተቶች የሚመነጭ ከሆነ:**  The passage suggests understanding the plane's mechanics helps with fear stemming from the flight itself, not trauma from unrelated events.

በምንባቡ በመመስረት፣ ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ ዋጋ የሚያሳስበው ተጓዥ መጨረሻ ማረግ ያለበት የትኛውን ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: በበርካታ የጉዞ ኩባንያዎች መካከል ዋጋዎችን ያወዳድሩ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...one type of flight can have widely different prices with different arrangers..."" and ""...it pays to compare search results and check the airline's website itself before cutting a deal.""
* This implies that prices vary *between* different booking platforms (arrangers/travel companies).
* Therefore, a price-conscious traveler should **compare prices among multiple travel companies** to find the best deal.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **A: የበርካታ የጉዞ ኩባንያዎችን አቅርቦቶችን ይፈልጉ (Search offers from multiple travel companies):** While similar to C, it doesn't specifically emphasize *comparing* them – the comparison is the crucial part.
* **B: በቀጥታ ከአየር መንገዱ ጋር ይመዝገቡ (Register directly with the airline):** The passage suggests checking the airline's website, but *after* comparing other results, not as the first step.
* **D: የአየር መንገዱን ድር ጣቢያ ይመልከቱ (Check the airline’s website):**  This is a good step, but the passage says to do it *after* comparing, not instead of.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that ""it pays to compare the search results and check its own airline's website before booking."" This means checking the airline's website directly is a crucial step in potentially finding a better price.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: በተለያዩ ሰብሳቢዎች መካከል ዋጋዎችን ያወዳድሩ (Compare prices among aggregators)** - The passage says search results *should be compared* to the airline website, but doesn’t advise relying solely on aggregators.
*   **C: በአየር መንገዱ በቀጥታ ይቁረጡ (Book directly with the airline)** - While booking directly is mentioned, the passage emphasizes comparing *first*.
*   **D: ከጉዞ ወኪል ጋር በቀጥታ ይቁረጥ (Book directly with a travel agent)** - The passage doesn't mention travel agents at all.



"
አቅርቦትን አብሮ ለመጓዝ ተጓሽ መቼ ያስፈልጋል?,"The correct answer is **A: ዕቃዎች በአየር ጭነት ሲላኩ**

Here's why:

The passage states that when items are sent as air freight, they can get stuck in customs and take days to clear. The only proven way to expedite this process was to send them as accompanied baggage (with a traveler). This implies a traveler is *needed* when goods are shipped as air freight.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኩባንያው የራሱን አውሮፕላኖች ሲጠቀም** - The passage says large companies *have* their own planes, but doesn't link this to needing a traveler.
* **C: ዕቃዎች እንደተረጋገጠ ጓዝ ሲላኩ** - This is the *result* of needing a traveler, not the reason *why* a traveler is needed.
* **D: አቅርቦት በአንድ ትልቅ ኩባንያ ሲካሄድ** - The passage highlights the difficulties smaller companies face, implying they're the ones who would need this service.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that even if you prefer a specific airline, the benefits offered by frequent flyer programs can *vary* within the same alliance. It emphasizes that you should choose based on which airline within the alliance offers *better* benefits for your frequent flying patterns. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ብዙ ነጥቦችን የሚያቀርበው አየር መንገድ** (The airline that offers more points): Points aren't the only benefit. The passage is about the *overall* value of the program.
*   **B: በትልቁ አሊያንስ ያለውን አየር መንገድ** (The airline within the largest alliance): The size of the alliance isn't the key factor; it's the benefits *within* the alliance.
*   **C: ብዙ ጊዜ የሚጓዙበት አየር መንገድ** (The airline you fly most often): While loyalty is good, the passage says you should prioritize benefits *even if* it means switching from your preferred airline.

Here's why:

The passage states that frequent flyer benefits can vary *even within the same alliance* and that you might find better benefits with a different airline *in a different alliance*. This directly supports the idea that a different airline in a different alliance could offer more frequent flyer points.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: በተመሳሳይ አሊያስን ስር በጣም በተደጋጋሚ የተጓዙት አየር መንገድዎ** - The passage implies this isn't necessarily true, as benefits can differ even within the same alliance.
* **C: በጣም በተደጋጋሚ የተጓዙት አየር መንገድዎ በተለየ ህብረት ውስጥ** - This is a restatement of A, but not as direct a response to the passage's point.
* **D: በተመሳሳይ አሊያንስ ውስጥ የተለየ አየር መንገድ** - While the passage acknowledges different benefits *within* an alliance, it emphasizes the potential for *better* benefits outside of it.

The passage specifically states that excessive alcohol consumption can lead to ""blindness and death."" This directly indicates that alcohol can damage the sense of sight. While alcohol affects all senses, blindness is the only one explicitly mentioned as a potential consequence in the text."

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""የአልኮል መጠጦችን በልክ ይጠጡ።"" (Drink alcohol in moderation.) and that drinking too much leads to health problems. 
* **The passage also warns against:** illegal alcohol (option B) due to dangerous ingredients like methanol.
* **Options A and D** are not mentioned in the text and don't relate to reducing the harmful effects of alcohol.

በአምስተርዳም የንብረት ዋጋዎች ከፍተኛ የሆኑት የት ናቸው?,"The correct answer is **A: የካናል አውራጃ**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states: ""የቦታ ዋጋዎቹም በአገሪቱ ውስጥ ካሉት ከፍተኛ ናቸው"" (the property prices are among the highest in the country) *in reference to* the Canal District (የካናል አውራጃ).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: የዩኔስኮ የዓለም ቅርስነት በተሰየመ በማንኛውም ቦታ** - While the Canal District *is* a UNESCO site, the passage doesn't say *all* UNESCO sites in Amsterdam have high property values.
* **C: ከቢንነንስታድ የተወገዱ ቦታዎች** - The passage mentions the Canal District is *around* Binnenstad but doesn't say areas removed from it are expensive.
* **D: ታሪካዊ እሴት ያላቸው ቦታዎች** -  This is too broad. While historical value contributes to price, the passage specifically highlights the Canal District.



"

The passage explicitly states that the Canal District was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site ""for its special cultural and historical significance.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ልዩ ባህርያቱ (Its unique features)** - While true, the passage specifically highlights *historical and cultural* significance as the reason for the UNESCO designation.
* **C: በከቢንነንስታድ ዙሪያ ያለው ቦታ ነው (Its location around the Binnenstad)** - Location is a factor, but not the primary reason for the UNESCO listing.
* **D: ከፍተኛ የንብረት ዋጋው (Its high property prices)** - Property values are a result of the area's desirability, but are not the reason it's a UNESCO site.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: አንግኮር ማለፊያ በኩል ማለፍ** (Passing through the Angkor Pass) - While necessary, the passage doesn't say *why* it makes the visit worthwhile, only that it's required.
* **C: Siem Reapን ማየት** (Seeing Siem Reap) - The passage doesn't mention a view of Siem Reap.
* **D: ወደ ሐይቁ የሚደረገው የጀልባ ጉዞ** (The boat trip to the lake) - The boat trip *facilitates* the visit but isn't what makes it worthwhile according to the text.

The passage states: ""مቅደሱ ውስጥ ለመግባት አንግኮር ማለፊያ ያስፈልጋል..."" which translates to ""An Angkor pass is required to enter the temple...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የYasovarman ቤተመቅደስን አልፎ መውጣት** - The passage mentions Yasovarman as the king who built the temple, not a requirement for entry.
*   **B: Siem Reap አከባቢ መራመድ** - While Phnom Krom is near Siem Reap, simply being in the area isn't enough to enter.
*   **D: Tonle Sap አከባቢ መዋኝት** - Visiting Tonle Sap is mentioned in relation to how to *get* to Phnom Krom (by boat), but isn't a requirement for entering the temple itself."

Here's why:

The passage states that visiting Antarctica is ""much money-demanding"". This directly implies a significant travel budget is required, and therefore a barrier to visiting for many.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: የራዝ ሲንን የመፈለግ ብቸኛ ፍላጎት** - The passage doesn't mention anything about a desire to see penguins.
*   **C: በታህሳስ እና በጥር ውስጥ ለመጓዝ የሚያስችል የስራ መርሃ ግብር** - The passage specifies visits happen *between* November and February, not specifically December/January. It doesn't mention work schedules.
*   **D: የተገደበ የአካል እንቅስቃሴ** - While the passage mentions physical fitness is *required*, it doesn't say limited activity *prevents* a visit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: የሀገር ውስጥ አከባቢ (Interior)** - The text describes the interior as a 2-3km ice-covered desert, not a mountaineering destination.
*   **C: ዳርቻዎችን (Peninsula)** - The text says most tourism is limited *to* the peninsula, islands, and Ross Sea, but doesn't mention mountaineering there.
*   **D: ደሴቶችን (Islands)** - Similar to the peninsula, the islands are popular tourist spots, but not specifically for mountaineering according to the passage.

Here's why:

The passage states that pre-modern observatories are often found in towns or campuses that are *easier to reach* than modern observatories.  This directly supports the idea that they are in easily accessible locations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: በከተማው መሃል** - While some might be in towns, the passage doesn't emphasize being *in the center* of a city.
* **C: ሩቅ አከባቢ** - This describes where *modern* telescopes are located, not pre-modern ones.
* **D: ኮሌጅ ካምፓስ** -  This is mentioned as a *possible* location, but ""easily accessible"" is a broader and more direct answer based on the passage.



"
ዘመናዊ የምርምር ቴሌስኮፕ የት ሊቀመጥ ይችላል?,"The correct answer is **D: በሰፊ አከባቢ (in a remote area)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that modern research telescopes are typically located in ""remote areas with good weather conditions."" Options A, B, and C describe locations where older observatories were *often* found, but not where *modern* ones are built.

Here's why:

The passage states the beaches in the North Shore District ""are all generally amenable to swimming, many are sheltered by pohutukawa trees."" This suggests a calmer, more protected, and pleasant swimming environment compared to the other options.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: ኤስቲ ሄኤርስ & B: በሚሽን ቤይ:** These are described as being in Central Auckland and can be ""busy"" with shops, indicating they are likely more crowded and less peaceful.
*   **D: በዌይቲማታ ወደብ:** This area also falls under the Central Auckland description and is likely busy as well.

Therefore, the North Shore District is the most promising for a quiet beach day based on the information provided."

Here's why:

The passage states that the beaches in the North Shore District ""are all, it is safe to say, amenable to swimming.""  It specifically describes them as having sandy beaches suitable for swimming.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ደቨንፖርት** - While Devonport is mentioned, it's just a southern boundary of the North Shore beaches, not singled out as particularly safe.
*   **C: በሴንትራል ኦክላንድ** - The Central Auckland beaches (Mission Bay, St Heliers, and Westhaven) are described as sometimes crowded, but swimming is not guaranteed.
*   **D: ከሎንግ ቤይ** - Long Bay is also mentioned in the north shore district so it doesn’t specifically convey the safest option.

Therefore, the North Shore District is explicitly presented as having the most consistently swimming-friendly beaches."

The prompt explicitly states: ""በህንፃ መዋቅሮች ላይ የሚሳሉ ስእሎችና ጽሁፎች በመቧጨር ወይም ምልክት በማድረግ ጣቢያውን አያጥፉ፡፡"" (Do not deface the site by scratching or marking pictures or writings on the building structures).  Leaving a mark anywhere on the site is a direct violation of this instruction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኮስታራ መሆን (Being Costa Rican)**: The prompt doesn't restrict visitors based on nationality.
*   **C: መቀለድ (Joking)**: The prompt specifically says ""ስለ እልቂቱ ወይም ናዚዎች አይቀልዱ"" (Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis).
*   **D: አካልን መቧጨር (Scratching the body)**: While generally impolite, the prompt focuses on not damaging the *site* itself.

ከእነዚህ ውስጥ የቋንቋ ፍራንካስ ቋንቋዎችን የሚገልጸው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: የተገነባ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that pidgin languages are ""ሰውሰራሽ ወይም የተገነቡ ቋንቋዎች"" (artificial or constructed languages).  The passage also contrasts them with ""ቋንቋ ፍራንካስ"" (lingua francas) which are *natural* languages used for communication between speakers of other languages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: አሬተፍሻል** - This doesn't relate to the definition provided in the text.
*   **B: የተፈጥሮ ያልሆነ** - While pidgins *are* not natural languages, the passage uses ""ተገነባ"" as the more precise description.
*   **D: ተፈጥሯዊ** - This is the opposite of what the passage says about pidgin languages. They are *not* natural.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that planned languages are *different* from auxiliary languages.** Auxiliary languages are *not* meant to replace natural languages or become dominant. They're meant to *facilitate* communication *between* speakers of different languages.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: በሌላ መንገድ መግባባት በማይችሉ ሰዎች መካከል ግንኙነትን ለማመቻቸት የሚያገለግሉ ንጽህ ቋንቋዎች ናቸው** - This aligns with the passage's definition of planned languages being created to ease communication.
* **B: ተፈጥሯዊና የተገነቡ ቋንቋዎች ናቸው** - The passage states they are *either* artificial *or* constructed.
* **C: አስቸጋሪ የንግግር ሁኔታዎችን ለማሻሻል የተገነቡ ቋንቋዎች ናቸው** - This matches the initial definition of being designed to help those who find natural language communication difficult.

Here's why:

The passage states that if crossing the northern Baltic in winter, one should ""confirm the cabin location as the sound of movement through the ice is extremely agonizing for the affected."" This directly relates to a precaution a traveler needs to take if traveling in winter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Visa requirements:** The passage states travelers are *exempt* from visa questions, not that they need to confirm them.
*   **C: Warrants:** This word isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Time spent in the city:** The passage mentions St. Petersburg cruises *include* city time, but doesn't say a traveler needs to confirm it.

Here's why:

The passage states that traveling through ice is a problem during winter crossings of the Baltic Sea, causing a distressing sound. This implies that in summer, when the sea isn't frozen, you *avoid* traveling through ice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የከተማ ዉስጥ ግዜ:** The passage states Saint Petersburg voyages *include* city time.
*   **C: የቪዛ መስፈርቶች:** The passage says visa requirements are waived regardless of the season.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...ብዙ ምልክቶች በካታላን ብቻ ይመለከታሉ፤ ምክንያቱም በህግ የተመሰረተ የመጀመሪያው የይፋ ቋንቋ ነው።"" ( ""...many signs are in Catalan only because it is the first official language established by law."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ከስፓኒሽ ይልቅ በሰፊው ሰው የረዳዋል** - The passage states everyone *understands* Spanish, but doesn't say more people *understand* Catalan.
*   **C: በባርሴሎና ውስጥ ተመራጭ ቋንቋ ነው** - The passage says half *prefer* Catalan, which isn't the same as being the most widely used or preferred.
*   **D: Metro እና ሌሎች የህዝብ መገልገያዎች በብዛት የሚዘወተሩት ካታላን በሚናገሩ ዜጎች ነው** - The passage doesn’t give any information to confirm this.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the *experience* of high-end bed and breakfasts. It highlights:

*   **Bed quality:** Luxurious bedding, handmade linens, antique beds.
*   **Breakfast quality:** Local, seasonal ingredients, or the host's specialty.
*   **Ambiance:** Historic buildings, original materials, gardens, and pools.

These all contribute to a curated, high-quality, and often traditional experience. While modern amenities like WiFi are useful, the passage doesn't suggest they are a *priority* or something these establishments compete on. The focus is on tangible qualities related to comfort, local flavor, and historical charm.

Let's look at why the other options *are* priorities based on the passage:

*   **A: ልዩ የሜኑ አቃዎች (Special menu items):** The passage directly states breakfast can include ""local seasonal delights"" or the host's ""specialty.""
*   **B: ልዩ ጥንታዊ የቤት ዕቃዎች (Unique antique furniture):** The passage mentions finding ""antique beds"" is not surprising in these establishments.
*   **C: በደንብ የተጠበቁ የውጪ ቦታዎች (Well-maintained outdoor spaces):** The passage references gardens and pools as potential features of these locations.

በምንባቡ መመስረት፣ ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ በቅንጦት B&Bs መካከል ካሉት ዋና የውድድር ነጥቦች ውስጥ አንዱ ያልሆነው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ዘመናዊ ጌጣጌጥ (Modern decor)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on luxury B&Bs competing on:

*   **Bed quality:** ""ቄንጠኛ ብርድ ልብስ, ምናልባት በእጅ የተሰራ አልጋ ልብስ ወይም ጥንታዊ አልጋ"" (high-quality linens, potentially handmade or antique beds)
*   **Breakfast quality:** ""ቁርስ የአካባቢውን ወቅታዊ አስደሳች ነገሮች ወይም የእንግዳ ተቀባዩን ልዩ ምግብ ሊያካትት ይችላል"" (breakfast including local seasonal items or the host's specialties)
*   **Ambiance/Location:** ""አካባቢው ታሪካዊ የድሮ ህንፃ ሆኖ የጥንት ቁሳቁሶች፣ የተከረከሙ መሬቶች እና የመዋኛ ገንዳ"" (historic buildings with original materials, aged floors, and a swimming pool)

While a luxury B&B *could* have modern decor, the passage doesn't mention it as a key competitive point. It emphasizes *traditional* quality, local flavor, and historical charm.  The other options (B, C, and D) are explicitly mentioned as areas of competition."
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ በ2022 በቤጂንግ የማይካሄደው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: Taizicheng ski area events**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Other ice sports events will be held approximately 220 km (140 miles) from Beijing, in Zhangjiakou at the Taizicheng ice sports area."" This means Taizicheng events are *not* in Beijing.

The passage also states that Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies and indoor ice sports.
"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ በ2022 በቤጂንግ የሚስተናገደው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: የክረምት ኦሎምፒክ**.

The passage explicitly states: ""P: በቻይና የቤዢንግ ከተማ የክረምት ኦሎምፒክ ጨዋታዎችን በ2022 የሚያስተናግድ ይሆናል..."" (P: The city of Beijing in China will host the 2022 Winter Olympics...). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የበጋ ኦሎምፒክ** - The passage states Beijing is hosting the *Winter* Olympics, and will be the first city to host both summer *and* winter games.
*   **B: ቤት ውስጥ የሚደረጉ የበረዶ ዝግጅቶች** - While the passage mentions indoor ice events are in Beijing, it doesn't say *only* indoor ice events are happening there.
*   **D: የመዝጊያ ዝግጅቶች** - The passage mentions closing ceremonies *will be* in Beijing, but doesn't say that's *all* that is happening there."
በአቪያን ኢንፍሉዌንዛ የመያዝ ከፍተኛ አደጋ ያለው ማነው?,"The correct answer is **C: የዶሮ እርባታ ሰራተኞች**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""አብዛኛዎቹ ከዶሮ እርባታ ጋር አብረው የሚሰሩ ሰዎችን ያካተቱ ቢሆንም..."" (Most cases have included people working with poultry farms...)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: የወፍ ጠባቂዎች:** While they have *some* risk (as stated in ""ተወሰነ አደጋ አለ"" - some risk exists for bird watchers), the passage highlights poultry workers as having the *majority* of cases.
*   **B: ከአጥቢ እንስሳት ጋር የሚሰሩ ሰዎች:** The passage mentions avian influenza can affect livestock, but doesn't emphasize them as the primary risk group.
*   **D: ቀደም ሲል በበሽታው የተያዙ ሰዎች:** The passage doesn't suggest prior infection increases risk of re-infection.

በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ከሚከተሉት አረፍተ ነገሮች ውስጥ የወፍ ጉንፋንን በትክክል የሚገልጸው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: የአእዋፍ ጠባቂዎች በበሽታው የመጠቃት አደጋ ተጋርጦባቸዋል.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...in avian enthusiasts there is some risk."" This directly supports the idea that bird keepers are at risk of contracting the disease.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: በጉንፋን የተያዙት የዶሮ እርባታ ሰራተኞች ብቻ ናቸው።** (Only poultry workers have been affected by the flu.) - The passage specifically says most cases are *among* poultry workers, but also mentions risk for avian enthusiasts.
* **B: በሰዎች ላይ ከወፎች ይልቅ ብዙ ጉዳዮች ተዘግበዋል** (More cases have been reported in humans than in birds.) - The passage does not provide information about the number of cases in birds compared to humans.
* **D: በሰዎች ላይ የተመዘገቡት ሁሉም ጉዳዮች ገዳይ ነብሩ** (All reported cases in humans have been fatal.) - The passage states *some* cases have been fatal, not all.



"
የWhite Sea–Baltic ቦይ ምን ያገናኛል?,"The correct answer is **C: የአርክቲክ ውቅያኖስ እና የባልቲክ ባህር**.

The text explicitly states: ""The White Sea–Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean with the Baltic Sea..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ጥቁር ባሕር እና ካስፒያን ባሕር** - The passage mentions Vikings using Russian waterways to *reach* these seas, but the canal itself doesn't directly connect them.
* **B: ኦኔጋ ሐይቅ እና ቮልጋ ወንዝ** - While the canal *includes* these waterways, it connects more than just these two.
* **D: ደቡብ ውቅያኖስ እና ቀይ ባህር** -  These bodies of water are not mentioned in the text and are geographically irrelevant to the discussion.

በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ተሳፋሪው እንዳይረበሽ ፓስፖርት በምን አይነት ተሽከርካሪ ላይ ሊሰበሰብ ይችላል?,"The correct answer is **B: የምሽት እንቅልፍ ባቡሮች**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""በምሽቱ በሚተኛባቸው ባቡሮች ውስጥ፤ እንቅልፍዎ እንዳይቋረጥብዎት ፓስፖርቶች በቲኬት ቆራጩ ሊሰበሰቡ ይችላሉ።"" (In overnight trains, passports may be collected by the ticket collector so your sleep is not disturbed.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: አውሮፕላን (Airplanes)** - The passage mentions immigration checks at airports but doesn't say passports are *collected* on airplanes.
*   **C: መርከቦች (Ships)** - The passage mentions immigration checks at ships but doesn't say passports are *collected*.
*   **D: ሀገር አቋራጭ ባቡሮች (Cross-country trains)** - While passports are needed on some cross-country trains, the passage *specifically* mentions collection happening on overnight trains."

Here's why:

The passage states: ""በምሽቱ በሚተኛባቸው ባቡሮች ውስጥ፤ እንቅልፍዎ እንዳይቋረጥብዎት ፓስፖርቶች በቲኬት ቆራጩ ሊሰበሰቡ ይችላሉ።"" This directly indicates that identification (passports) may be checked during sleeping/night time on certain trains.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ከባቡሩ ከወረዱ በኋላ** - The passage mentions immigration checkpoints are *usually* the first thing you encounter when disembarking, but doesn't say identification is checked *only* then on these trains.
*   **C: ፍተሻ አይካሄድም** - The passage explicitly states inspections *do* happen on some cross-border trains.
*   **D: በሚጓዝ ባህር ላይ** - The passage refers to trains, not ships.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""ሙቀትን (ሁልጊዜ) እና ጠንካራ ፀሃይን (ሰማዩ ሲጠራ በጣም አልፎ አልፎ) ሊቋቋሙ ያስፈልግዎታል።""  This directly points to the risk of heat-related issues.  Heat exhaustion is a common consequence of prolonged exposure to high temperatures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ስርቆት (Theft):** The passage emphasizes safety in Singapore generally.
* **B: ሱቅ ማግኘት አለመቻል (Inability to find shops):** The passage says you can buy everything you need.
* **D: መጥፋት (Getting lost):**  The passage highlights the ease of getting around, not the difficulty.

የጀርመን ጣፋጮችን ከመመገብ ማን ሊቆጠብ ይችላል?,"The correct answer is **A: ከባድ የለውዝ አለርጂ ያለበት ሰው**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states many German baked goods *include* nuts, specifically hazelnuts and other tree nuts. Someone with a severe almond allergy (almonds are tree nuts) would need to avoid these.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: የበለጸጉ ጣፋጭ ምግቦችን የሚመርጥ ሰው** – The passage *describes* German cakes as rich and varied, making this person a likely enjoyer, not someone who would avoid them.
*   **C: ቸኮሌት የማይወድ ሰው** – The passage doesn’t mention chocolate as an ingredient.
*   **D: ስኳር ካለበት ጣዕም ይልቅ ጣፋጭ ጣዕምን የሚመርጥ ሰው** – The passage focuses on sweet cakes, so this preference wouldn’t prevent someone from eating them.



"
የጀርመን መጋገሪያዎች ወቅታዊ ንጥረ አካል የሆነው የትኛው ንጥረ ነገር ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ፖም (Apples)**.

The text specifically states: ""Ameenu full pomo-wo endebassalu and enjorichina freewochi begaw endetayu fererfe mengeriawoch telamedu nechin."" which translates to ""Apples ripen into desserts all year round and plums and berries appear in summer, making fruit desserts common."" This highlights apples as a key, seasonally available ingredient in German baking.

While hazelnuts are mentioned, they aren't presented as being *seasonally* important like apples are. Plums and almonds are mentioned as fruits used, but apples are stated to be used *all year round* as they ripen throughout the year.

በምባቡ መመስረት፣ ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ በበጀት ለመጓዝ የማይመከር ጠቃሚ ምክር የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ሰዎችን ገንዘብ ይጠይቁ (Ask people for money)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ምክር ተጓዦች እንደማይሰርቁ፣ የተከለከሉ ቦታዎች እንደማይገቡ ፣ ህጋዊ ባልሆነ ገበያ እንደማይሳተፉ፣ እንደማይለምኑ ወይም ሌሎች ሰዎችን ለራሳቸው ጥቅም እንደማይበዘብዙ ያስባል።"" (The advice discourages travelers from stealing, entering prohibited areas, participating in illegal markets, begging, or exploiting others for personal gain.)  Asking people for money (begging) falls directly into this prohibited category.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with budget travel according to the text:

* **A: በጉዞዎ ወቅት የሚሰሩትን ያልተለመዱ ስራዎችን ያግኙ (Find unconventional jobs during your travels):**  This aligns with the first type of budget travel mentioned (earning while you travel), even though the passage focuses on minimizing expenses.
* **B: ከምቾት ደረጃዎ ጋር ተለዋዋጭ ይሁኑ (Be flexible with your comfort level):**  The passage emphasizes sacrificing ""comfort, time, and predictability"" to reduce costs.
* **D: እንደ ምግብ እና ማረፊያ ያሉ ወጪዎችን ይቀንሱ (Reduce expenses like food and lodging):** This is the core focus of the passage – finding ways to get by with minimal spending.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ በጣም አነስተኛ በሆነ በጀት ጉዞ ማድረግ ማን ላይ አስቸጋሪ ሊሆን ይችላል?,"The correct answer is **B: ጥብቅ የጊዜ ገደብ የሌለበት ሰው**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that minimal budget travel involves sacrificing ""comfort, time, and predictability."" Someone without a strict time limit is *less* likely to be willing to sacrifice the comfort and predictability that come with more expensive travel options. They have the flexibility to take their time and aren't necessarily forced to cut costs severely.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ፈተናን የሚቀበል ሰው (Someone who welcomes a challenge)** - The passage implies this type of person might *enjoy* the constraints of minimal budget travel.
*   **C: በሚጓዝበት ጊዜ በርቀት ለመስራት ያቀደ ሰው (Someone who plans to work remotely while traveling)** - This is about *earning* while traveling, not minimizing costs, and the passage focuses on the latter.
*   **D: የጉዞ መንገድን መከተል የሚያስደስተው ሰው (Someone who enjoys following a travel route)** - This doesn’t directly relate to being able to handle a very low budget.

ከሚከተሉት አረፍተ ነገሮች ውስጥ በPoint Marion እና Fairmont መካከል ያለውን ልዩነት በትክክል የማይገልጸው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: የፍጥነት ገደቦች እምብዛም አይታዘዙም**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**ካለማክበር ይልቅ ለእነርሱ በጥብቅ መገዛት በጣም ጠቃሚ ነው።**"" (It is very important to strictly adhere to them rather than disregard them). This directly contradicts the idea that speed limits are often disobeyed.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

*   **A: የሩቅ አገር መንገድ ረዣዥም ቦታዎች አሉ** - The passage describes ""extended stretches of countryside"" and challenging driving conditions on rural roads.
*   **B: መስመሮች ጥብቅ ናቸው** -  The text mentions ""narrow roads"" and the need for caution, implying the roads are not wide and well-defined.
*   **D: የሞባይል ስልክ አገልግሎት ጉዳይ መሆን የለበትም** - The passage notes that mobile service is *better* here than in some other rural areas, suggesting it's a surprising benefit and shouldn't be taken for granted.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""The posted speed limits are noticeably low—typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)—and adhering to them strictly is crucial rather than exceeding them."" This highlights the importance of driving slowly and carefully on the winding roads.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በከባድ ትራፊክ መጨናነቅ ውስጥ መሆን** (Being in heavy traffic) - The passage doesn't mention traffic congestion.
*   **B: በቂ የተንቀሳቃሽ ስልክ አገልግሎት እጥረት** (Lack of sufficient mobile phone service) - The passage actually says mobile service is *better* on this route than in other rural areas.
*   **D: ተደጋጋሚ የመንገድ ሥራን ማጋጠም** (Encountering frequent road work) - The passage doesn't mention frequent road work.

ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ ካንዮኒንግ ለመጀመር የማይፈለግ የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: ከፍተኛ የአካል ሁኔታ (High physical condition)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that canyoneering requires *relatively little* training or physical fitness compared to activities like rock climbing, deep-water soloing, or mountain skiing.  The other options (swimming ability, jumping ability, and some training) are all mentioned as components of canyoneering. Therefore, high physical condition is the least desired attribute to begin canyoneering.



"
ለስኬታማ ካንዮኒንግ ጉብኝት ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ የትኛው አስፈላጊ ሊሆን ይችላል?,"The correct answer is **D: የመዋኘት ችሎታ (Swimming ability)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states canyoning can involve dry or water-filled canyons.** This directly implies swimming may be necessary.
* While canyoning doesn't require *high* levels of fitness like rock climbing or skiing, it does combine elements of walking, scrambling, and potentially swimming. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: የላቀ የአትሌቲክስ ችሎታ (Advanced athletic ability):** The passage specifically says it requires *relatively* little training compared to other sports.
* **B: በስኩባ ዳይቪንግ የቀድሞ ልምድ (Previous scuba diving experience):** Canyoning is not scuba diving; it involves natural canyons, not underwater exploration with tanks.
* **C: በ ካንዮኒንግ ውስጥ የምስክር ወረቀት (Canyoning certification):** The passage doesn't mention certification as a requirement, just that it's accessible with less training than other activities.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ በመኪናው ውስጥ ለመስፈር ላቀደ ሰው ምን ይጠቅማል?,"The correct answer is **B: መቀመጫዎቹ እንዲቀመጡ የሚያስችል ተሽከርካሪ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that car camping is only feasible with a minivan, SUV, station wagon, or similar vehicle *because* they have seats that can recline or be removed to create space.  The passage says a regular car is not suitable for ""camping"" due to space limitations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ስለ ተሽከርካሪዎ ገደቦች ጠንካራ ግንዛቤ (A strong understanding of your vehicle's limitations)** - While the passage mentions knowing your car's limitations, it's not *what* someone needs *to* car camp, it's a statement about regular cars being unsuitable.
*   **C: ድንኳን (A tent)** - The passage implies that car camping aims to *avoid* needing a tent because you're utilizing the vehicle's interior space.
*   **D: ለመሰፈር የግል ንብረት (Private property to camp on)** - The passage warns that camping on private property easily attracts unwanted attention. It doesn't suggest it's *needed* for car camping.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ የመኪና ሰፋሪዎች በራዳር ስር ለመቆየት ከፈለጉ ምን ማስወገድ ይፈልጋሉ?,"The correct answer is **C: በከተማ ውስጥ ወይም በግል ንብረት ላይ ድንኳን መትከል**.

Here's why:

The passage states that setting up a tent ""on private property or any amount of settlement"" easily attracts unwanted attention.  The question asks what car travelers should avoid to stay ""under the radar."" Avoiding visible camping on private land or in populated areas directly addresses that concern.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: እንደ SUV ወይም ሚኒቫን ያለ ትልቅ ተሽከርካሪ መንዳት** - The passage actually *suggests* needing an SUV or minivan *for* car camping (to have space to sleep inside).
* **B: ረጅም የመንገድ ጉዞ ማድረግ** - The passage mentions long drives as a positive aspect of using your own car, not something to avoid.
* **D: ከሚጠቀሙት ተሽከርካሪ ጋር በደንብ አለመተዋወቅ** - While knowing your vehicle's limitations is mentioned, it isn't about staying under the radar; it's about safe driving.

በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ካዛብላንካን ለሁለተኛ ጊዜ ማን ሠራው?,"The correct answer is **D: የ ሞሮኮ ስልጣን** (The Moroccan Sultan).

Here's why:

The text states: ""የሞሮኮው ሱልጣን ከተማዋን ዳሩ ኤል ባድያ ብሎ በመሰየም እንደገና የገነባት"" which translates to ""The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city, naming it Dar el Badia.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ፖርቹጋሎች (Portuguese):** The text says the Portuguese *destroyed* and then rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but later *abandoned* it. They didn't rebuild it a second time.
*   **B: የስፔን ነጋዴዎች (Spanish merchants):** Spanish merchants were mentioned as establishing trading posts, but they didn't rebuild the entire city.
*   **C: መሪኒዶች (Merinids):** The Merinids used it as a port, but the text doesn't say they rebuilt it."
የተፈጥሮ አደጋን ተከትሎ ዘመናዊቷን የካዛብላንካን ከተማ ማን ጥሏት ወጣ?,"The correct answer is **B: ፖርቹጋሎች**.

Here's why: The text states ""ፖርቹጊዞቹ አፈረሱት እና ካዛ ብራንካ በሚል ስም መልሰው ገነቡት፣ በ1755 ከመሬት መንቀጥቀጥ በኋላ መልሰው ተዉት።"" This directly translates to ""The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, then left it again after the 1755 earthquake."" 

Therefore, the Portuguese left the city after the natural disaster (the earthquake)."

Here's why:

The text states that Sintra became popular with foreigners ""after an amazing story was recorded by Lord Byron in the town of Sintra."" This directly links Sintra's fame to Lord Byron's writings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cabo da Roca:** Cabo da Roca is a location the bus stops at, but it doesn't explain *why* Sintra is famous.
*   **B: የማሪያን መግለጫዎች:** The text mentions a shrine related to the Virgin Mary, but this is presented as a place people visit *in* Sintra, not the reason for its initial fame.
*   **D: የፍቅር ታሪክ ነው:** While the text mentions an ""amazing love,"" it doesn't say the love story itself caused the town's popularity; rather, it was Lord Byron's recording of the story.

በአርሜኒያ እውቅና ያላገኘው ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: አዲሱ ሪፓብሊክ**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""a new republic was formed"" in Nagorno-Karabakh, but that ""no established country - including Armenia - officially recognized it.""  This directly answers the question of what didn't receive recognition from Armenia (and other countries).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የ Nagorno-Karabakh አከባቢ** - The area itself isn't something that *receives* recognition, the political entity formed within it is.
*   **B: ከአዘር ጋር የተደረገ ጦርነት** - The war happened, it wasn't something awaiting recognition.
*   **C: የአዘርባጃን ዲፕሎማሲያዊ ክርክሮች** -  Diplomatic disputes aren't something that would be recognized by Armenia.



"
በአዘርባጃን እና በአርሜኒያ መካከል ያለውን ግንኙነት የሚነካው ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: 1994 ጦርነት (1994 War)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states the war initiated by Armenians in 1994 created a new republic and *continues* to strain relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan through ongoing diplomatic disputes.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: በአዘርባይጃን የሚኖሩ አርመኖች (Armenians living in Azerbaijan):** While their presence is likely a factor, the passage doesn't directly state this as the main issue affecting relations.
*   **C: ዲፕሎማሳዊ ክሪክር (Diplomatic disputes):** These are a *result* of the underlying issue, not the issue itself.
*   **D: Nagorno-Karabakh አከባቢ (Nagorno-Karabakh region):** This is the *location* of the conflict, but the *conflict* (the 1994 war and its aftermath) is what’s damaging the relationship.

በቻርሎት ውስጥ ታክሲ እየተጓዙ ሳሉ፣ ወደ ተጨማሪ ክፍያ ምን ሊመራ ይችላል?,"The correct answer is **B: ሶስት ተጓዦች መኖር**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""ከ 2 በላይ ተሳፋሪዎች እንዲኖሩዎት ተጨማሪ ክፍያ አለ"". This directly means having more than two passengers will result in an extra charge.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሌላ ቦታ መኖር** - The passage doesn't mention location affecting taxi fares.
*   **C: ወደላይ ከተማ መሄድ** - The passage doesn't mention fares based on destination.
*   **D: ቤተሰብ መሆን** - While Charlotte is family-friendly, simply *being* a family doesn't trigger extra taxi charges. It's the *number* of people that matters.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that taxis aren't often used by families in Charlotte because of extra charges for more than two passengers, making them potentially expensive. This is presented as a drawback.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የቤት ዋጋ (House prices)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about the cost of housing.
*   **C: የሌላ አከባቢ ነዋሪዎች (Residents from other areas)** - The passage states people *move* to Charlotte for family-friendliness, not that this is a negative.
*   **D: ከተማን ለዝናናት መሞከር (Trying to explore the city with children)** - The passage actually says visitors with children find the city easy to love.

The passage states: ""Before the arrival of the Spanish in the sixteenth century, the northern part of Chile was under the Inca Empire..."" 

Therefore, the Incas controlled the northern part of Chile before the Spanish arrived.
"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ በ 1810 ያልተከሰተ የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: ቺሊ በስፔን ላይ ድል ተቀዳጅታለች**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Chile declared its independence in 1810, but it *wasn't* fully achieved until 1818. This means they didn't win their independence in 1810.
*   The passage explicitly mentions a lack of central government (A) due to the Napoleonic Wars, and that the Napoleonic Wars (C) *were* happening.
*   The passage indicates that Chile *started* its independence process in 1810 (D), but didn't complete it then.

Therefore, the only event that didn't occur in 1810, according to the passage, is Chile winning independence from Spain."
በሊጉሪያ ክልል ውስጥ ያሉ ሩቅ መንደሮች እንዴት ሰዎች መድረስ ይችላሉ?,"The correct answer is **C: በ ባቡር ወይም በ ጀልባ**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""መንገዶች፣ ባቡሮች እና ጀልባዎች መንደሮቹን ያገናኛሉ እና መኪኖች ከውጪ ሊደርሱባቸው አይችሉም።"" (Roads, trains and boats connect the villages and cars cannot reach them from the outside.)

This directly indicates that you can reach the Cinque Terre villages by train or boat.



"
የጣሊያን ቃል 'Cinque Terre' ምንን ያመለክታል?,"The correct answer is **A: አምስት ቀበሌዎች**.

The passage states ""ሲንኬ ቴራ፣ ትርጉሙም አምስት መሬቶች ማለት ነው..."" which directly translates to ""Cinque Terre, which means five lands/territories.""  ""ቀበሌዎች"" is the closest equivalent to ""lands/territories"" in this context.
"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ የትኛው አይነት ቡትስ ሊንሸራተቱ ለሚችሉ የክረምት ሁኔታዎች ተስማሚ ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: Boot shoes with attached devices**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""some boots have studs and for slippery areas studded, for most shoes and boots there are additional devices suitable for ice or ice and sole."" This directly indicates that boots with *attached devices* are suitable for slippery winter conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Narrow sole boots:** The passage states that soles should be *wide* and low, not narrow.
*   **C: High sole boots:** The passage specifically states soles should be *low* and wide.
*   **D: Boots without 1/5 inch depth:** The passage emphasizes the importance of a tread depth of at least 5mm (1/5 inch).



"
ከእነዚህ ውስጥ በክረምት ሁኔታዎች በበረዶ መንገዶች ላይ ያለውን መሳብ ለማሻሻል የማይረዳው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: ዉሃ (Water)**.

Here's why:

*   **Salt (ጨው), Gravel (ጠጠር), and Sand (አፈር)** are all mentioned in the passage as materials spread on roads and pathways to *improve* traction on icy surfaces.
*   **Water (ዉሃ)**, especially when it freezes, *creates* ice and makes surfaces *more* slippery – the opposite of what's needed to improve traction.

The passage explicitly states that ice is the problem, and adding water would worsen the situation."
ከሚከተሉት በሃዋይ እና በኩክ ደሴቶች መካከል ያለው ትክክለኛ ተመሳሳይነት የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ተመሳሳይ የሰዓት ዞን ይጋራሉ**.

The passage explicitly states: ""ከHawaii የሰአት አቆጣጠር ጋር ተመሳሳይ ሲሆኑ..."" which translates to ""They have the same time zone as Hawaii..."".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሁለቱም ብዙ ትልልቅ ሆቴሎች አሏቸው** - The passage actually implies the opposite for the Cook Islands, saying they had fewer large hotels *before* development.
*   **B: ሁለቱም የሀገር ተቀባይነት የላቸውም** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: ሁለቱም ከተማ የላቸውም** - While the passage states the Cook Islands have no cities, it doesn't say the same about Hawaii."
ከሚከተሉት የCook Islands በትክክል የማይገልጸው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ዋናዎቹ ከተሞች Rarotonga እና Aitutaki ናቸው**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Cook Islands ምንም ከተሞች የላቸው ነገር ግን ከ15 በላይ የተለያዩ ደሴቶች አሏቸው። ዋናዎቹ ራሮቶንጋ እና ኤቱታኪ ናቸው።"" (Cook Islands has no cities but more than 15 different islands. The main ones are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.) This means Rarotonga and Aitutaki are *islands*, not cities.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: ከHawaii ያነሰ ነው** (Is less than Hawaii) - The text implies this by saying they are sometimes considered ""Hawaii down under"" and are a smaller island nation.
*   **B: የትናንሽ ደሴቶች ስብስብ ነው** (Is a collection of small islands) -  The passage states it is an archipelago of 15 islands.
*   **D: የደሴቲቱ አገር ከHawaii ጋር ተመሳሳይ የሰዓት ዞን ትጋራለች** (The island nation shares a similar time zone with Hawaii) - The text explicitly states this: ""ከHawaii የሰአት አቆጣጠር ጋር ተመሳሳይ ሲሆኑ..."" (Similar to Hawaii's time zone...)



"
ከሚከተሉት የደንበኛ ጣቢያዎች ውስጥ ሁለት ዓይነት የመጠለያ አማራጮችን የሚሰጠው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Sirena is the only ranger station that offers both lodging and meals with camping.""

The other options only offer camping:

*   Los Patos: ""camping only""
*   La Leona: ""camping only""
*   San Pedrillo: ""camping only"""
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ በብድር ምትክ ጥሬ ገንዘብ ለመጠቀም ከፈለጉ የፓርክ ፈቃድ የት ሊያዝ ይችላል?,"The correct answer is **B: Puerto Jiménez**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""የፓርክ ፈቃዶችን በቀጥታ ከሬንጀር ጣቢያ በፖርቶ ሂሜኔዝ ማግኘት ይቻላል፣ ነገር ግን የብድር ካርዶችን አይቀበሉም።"" (Park permits can be obtained directly from the ranger station in Puerto Jiménez, but they do not accept credit cards.)

This means if you want to pay with cash (instead of credit), you need to go to Puerto Jiménez.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ገደላማ በሆነ ቦታ ላይ ምን አይነት የበረዶ መንሸራተት ነው የሚደረገው?,"The correct answer is **B: የባክካንትሪ የበረዶ መንቸራተት**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that carrying a rucksack (ቦርሳ) while skiing is often referred to as ""backcountry skiing"" (ባክካንትሪ የበረዶ መንሸራተት).  It then contrasts this with alpine-style ski touring and mountaineering, which require more specialized equipment and take place in narrower, steeper terrain.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ከፍተኛ ፍጥነት መድረስ ለሚፈልጉ የባክካንትሪ የበረዶ ተንሸራታቾች ምን ሊረዳቸው ይችላል?,"The correct answer is **C: ጥሩ ሁኔታ**.

Here's why:

The passage states that in good conditions, backcountry skiers can cover distances ""comparable to cross-country skiing speed."" This directly links good conditions to achieving higher speeds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ጠባብ ጫማ (Narrow skis):** The passage contrasts backcountry skiing with alpine skiing which *requires* wider skis. It doesn't suggest narrow skis aid in speed.
* **B: ከባድ የጀርባ ሸክም (Heavy backpack):** The passage specifically mentions carrying a ""substantial pack"" but doesn't imply it helps with speed. In fact, a heavy pack would likely *reduce* speed.
* **D: የተስተካከሉ መንገዶች (Prepared trails):** Backcountry skiing is done on un-groomed terrain, so prepared trails aren’t a factor. The text even contrasts it to trails used for mountain ascents.



"
እንደገና የመግባት ድንጋጤ ያጋጠማቸው ተጓዦች ምን ለማድረግ ይቸገራሉ?,"The correct answer is **D: የቤታቸውን ባህል ማንበብ (Understanding their own culture)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that re-entry shock happens when travelers have adjusted to a new culture and then struggle to readjust to their *home* culture. They've lost touch with some of their own cultural habits and find it difficult to reintegrate. This means the difficulty lies in *understanding* their own culture again, as it's now viewed with a different perspective.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ከአዲስ ቦታ ባህል ጋር መላመድ (Adjusting to a new place's culture)** - This describes culture shock, not re-entry shock.
*   **B: ታጋሽ መሆን እና መረዳት (Being patient and understanding)** - While patience and understanding are *helpful* in dealing with re-entry shock, they aren't what the travelers are struggling *to do*. The passage says others don't understand they need these qualities *upon return*.
*   **C: ውደ ዉጪ መጓዝ (Traveling abroad)** - This is the cause of the shock, not the struggle caused by re-entry.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ እንደገና የመግባት ድንጋጤ በተለይ ለየትኛው መንገደኛ ከባድ ሊሆን ይችላል?,"The correct answer is **B: በውጭ አገር በሚኖሩበት ጊዜ በፍጥነት የተስተካከሉ ተጓዦች**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ተጓዞች ከአዲሱ ባህል ለመላመድ ቀላል ጊዜ የነበራቸው አንዳንድ ጊዜ ከነባር ባህላቸው ጋር ዳግም ለመለማመድ በተለየ መልኩ ሊቸገሩ ይችላል።"" This directly supports the idea that those who adapted *easily* to the new culture may find re-entry shock particularly difficult.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage states re-entry shock can be *more* severe than culture shock, not that it's specifically worse for those who had bad culture shock.
*   **C:** The passage mentions ""ጫጉላ ደረጃ"" (frustration level) as being *lower* for re-entry shock compared to culture shock, making this option incorrect.
*   **D:** While patience is mentioned as important for re-entry, the passage doesn't state that those with less patience are specifically more affected. The focus is on the ease of initial adaptation.

ከሚከተሉት ሰዎች ከሙስ ጋር ከማድረግ መራቅ ያለባቸው የትኛው ነው?,"ይህንን ለመረዳት ለሚረዳን ቁልፍ ሐሳብ የP ንዑስ ክፍል ነው. አጋዘን በተፈጥሮ ጠበኛ አይደሉም ነገር ግን ሲያስፈራሩ ሲከላከሉ፡፡ ሰዎች አጋዘንን ሱሰኝነት ሲያዩ በጣም ቀርበው እራሳቸውን አደጋ ላይ ሊጥሉ ይችላሉ፡፡

በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ስለ ሙስ ከሚከተሉት አረፍተ ነገሮች ውስጥ እውነት ያልሆነው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: በተፈጥሮ ጠበኛ እንስሳት ናቸው (They are naturally predators)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states: ""አጋዘን (ኤልክ ተብሎም ይጠራል) በተፈጥሮ ጠበኛ አይደሉም (Gazelles (also called Elk) are not naturally predators).""

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

*   **B: አንዳንድ ጊዜ እንደ አስጊ ሁኔታ አይቆጠሩም (Sometimes they are not considered dangerous):** The passage says people see them as not dangerous.
*   **C: በቅርብ ርቀት ውስጥ ባሉ ሰዎች ሊቀሰቀሱ ይችላሉ (They can be provoked by people at close range):** This is implied by the warning that people get too close and put themselves at risk.
*   **D: አስፈላጊ ከሆነ እራሳቸውን ይከላከላሉ (They will defend themselves if necessary):** The passage states they defend themselves when they perceive a threat.

በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ ለበረሃ መንገደኛ በጣም አደገኛ የሆነው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: በቀዝቃዛ ምሽት ሞቅ ያለ ልብስ አለመኖር**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that even hot deserts can get very cold at night, and that not having appropriate clothing can lead to hypothermia (a dangerous condition).

Let's look at why the other options are less directly dangerous based on the text:

*   **B: የውሃ ቅዠት የሚሰጥ ተአምር ማየት** - While mirages can be disorienting, the passage states following a mirage is dangerous because it can lead you to waste resources, not just *seeing* it.
*   **C: ጋቢቻን በሚከታተልበት ጊዜ ጉልበት ማባከን** - This is dangerous because it wastes energy, but the passage links wasting water to greater danger.
*   **D: ጋቢቻን በሚከታተልበት ጊዜ ውሃ ማባከን** - This is also dangerous, but the passage explicitly mentions hypothermia from lack of warm clothing as a direct and potentially immediate threat.

Therefore, the passage most directly identifies the lack of warm clothing in a cold night as the biggest danger to a desert traveler."
ከሚከተሉት፣ ለበረሃ ተጓዦች ስጋት ሊሆን ይችላል ተብሎ ያልተጠቀሰው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: Gabichas**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    *   **Water illusions/hallucinations:** Leading to risky decisions about water sources.
    *   **Hypothermia:** Due to drastic temperature drops at night.
    *   **Heatstroke/Hyperthermia:** The danger of overheating during the day.
    *   **Dehydration:** Implied by the dangers of chasing mirages and risking water supplies.

*   **Gabichas** (I assume this is a misspelling and meant to be 'Gabbits' - a type of small desert rodent) are not mentioned in the passage. While desert animals *could* pose a risk, the text focuses on environmental dangers (heat, cold, illusions, water).

Therefore, **Gabichas** is the only option not presented as a concern for desert travelers in the given text."
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ አሳሾች ከመጡ በኋላ የየትኛው ቡድን ህዝብ በእጅጉ ተጎድቷል?,"The correct answer is **C: ታይኖስ**.

The text explicitly states: ""በጣም በአጭር አመታት ውስጥ ከአውሮፓውያን አሳሾች መምጣት በኋላ የTainos ህዝቦች ቁጥር በስፓኒሽ ወራሪዎች ምክንያት በከፍተኛ ሁኔታ እንዲቀንስ ተደርጓል።""  It even gives a number of how many Tainos were killed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሃይቲዎች** - The text mentions Haiti as sharing the island, but doesn't say their population was drastically reduced by Spanish colonizers.
*   **B: ካሪቤዎች** - While the text mentions the Caribs as being among the first settlers, it focuses on the decline of the Tainos.
*   **D: ስፔኖች** - The Spanish were the *cause* of the population decline, not the ones who experienced it.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ካሪቢስ የሚናገሩት ቋንቋ የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: አራዋካን**.

The text specifically states: ""ካሪቤስ ከአሁኑ ዘመን 10,000 ዓመታት በፊት የመጡ አራዋካን ተናጋሪ ህዝቦች ናቸው።"" (Karibs are Arawakan-speaking people who arrived from around 10,000 years ago.)

የበረዶ መንሸራተትን እንደ መዝናኛ እንቅስቃሴ በማወደሱ ማን ሊመሰገን ይችላል?,"The correct answer is **B: ኖርዌጂያኖች**.

Here's why:

The text states that ""በ1861 በኖርዌያኖች አውስትራሊያ ውስጥ የመጀመሪያው የመዝናኛ በረዶ ላይ መንሸራተት ክለብ ተከፍቶ ነበር"" (In 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational ice skating club in Australia). This directly links Norwegians to the promotion of ice skating as a recreational activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ስኪ ቡሞች (Ski Booms):** The text doesn't mention ""Ski Booms"" or their connection to ice skating.
*   **C: የዋሻ ነዋሪዎች (Cave dwellers):** Cave dwellers are mentioned only in relation to ancient depictions of ice skating, not its promotion as a recreational activity.
*   **D: ኡስትራሊያኖች (Australians):** While Australia *hosted* the first club, it was the Norwegians who *opened* it and therefore promoted the activity."
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ የበረዶ መንሸራተት በመጀመሪያ እንደ ስፖርት እውቅና ያገኘው ስንት ሰዓት አካባቢ ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: 17ኛ ክፍለ ዘመን**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""እንደ ስፖርት የቁልቁለት በረዶ ላይ መንሸራተት ቢያንስ እስከ 17ኛው ክፍለ ዘመን ወደኋላ ይሄዳል..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 18ኛ ክፍለ ዘመን** - The passage specifies *at least* the 17th century, not the 18th.
*   **B: 5000 BC** - This is when depictions of ice sliding were found, not when it became a sport.
*   **C: 1861** - This is when the first recreational ice skating club was formed, not when the sport was first recognized."
ከሚከተሉት በተለምዶ ከምስራቃዊ አፍሪካ የባህር ዳርቻ ወጣ ያለ ትልቁ ደሴት ጋር የተያያዘው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: አራዊት (Animals)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states, ""ማዳጋስካር እስካሁን ካሉት በጣም ትልቁ እና በራሱ አንድ አህጉር ነው።"" (Madagascar is the largest and virtually a continent of its own). It then discusses its unique wildlife. The question asks what is typically associated with the *largest* island, and the text links Madagascar directly to being significant for its animal life.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: የውሮፓዊያን ጫና (European influence):** While European influence is mentioned, it's not specifically tied to Madagascar as the *largest* island.
*   **B: የእስልምና እምነት (Islam):** Islam is mentioned as being prominent in Comoros and Mayotte, which are *smaller* islands.
*   **D: መርጥ መዝናኛዎች (Luxury resorts):** Luxury resorts are a characteristic of many of the *smaller* islands, not specifically the largest one.



"
የትናንሽ የምስራቅ አፍሪካ ደሴቶች ባህሪ ያልሆነው ምንድን ነው? ,"The correct answer is **C: ብዙ አራዊቶች (Many animals)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""አብዛኛዎቹ ትንንሽ ደሴቶች እራሳቸውን የቻሉ ሃገራት ናቸው ወይም ከፈረንሳይ ጋር የተያያዙ ናቸው እናም የቅንጦት የባሕር ዳርቻ ሪዞርቶች በመባል ይታወቃሉ።"" This supports options A, B, and D.
*   **The passage specifically highlights Madagascar** as having the most diverse and significant wildlife (""ዱር እንስሳትን በተመለከተ ማዳጋስካር እስካሁን ካሉት በጣም ትልቁ እና በራሱ አንድ አህጉር ነው።""). It doesn't mention abundant wildlife on the *smaller* islands.

Therefore, having many animals is not a characteristic of the smaller East African islands as described in the text."
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ፋሲካ በአንዳንድ በተለይም ባህላዊ አብያተ ክርስቲያናት እንዴት ይከበራል?,"The correct answer is **D: የፀሐይ መውጣትን መመልከት**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""P: ... ባህል አለ የፋሲካ ምሽትን ፀሃይ ስትወጣ ለማየት በሆነ በተጋለጠ ቦታ ነቅቶ የማሳለፍ"". This directly relates to celebrating Easter by watching the sunrise.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የመራባት ሥነ ሥርዓት መያዝ** - The passage doesn't mention any such ritual.
*   **B: የቅዳሜ ምሽት ሻማ ማብራት በማስተናገድ** - While the passage mentions celebrations starting Saturday night, it doesn't specifically say anything about candle lighting.
*   **C: ለጉባኤው የስፕሪንግ ግብዣ ማድረግ** - The passage focuses on the religious aspect and sunrise watching, not a spring feast.

ወደ ኢኳዶር ሲገቡ የተወሰኑ መስፈርቶችን ለማስቀረት የኩባ ዜጋ በመጀመሪያ ምን ሊኖረው ይገባል?,"The correct answer is **B: ሕጋዊ የግብዣ ደብዳቤ**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Ecuador *requires* Cuban citizens to present a letter of invitation (a ""letter of invitation"") *before* entering the country. This letter needs to be legalized by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and meet specific requirements.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ከጉዞ ቀናት በላይ ለ 6 ወራት የሚሰራ ፓፖርት:** While a valid passport is necessary, the text says this is a general requirement *in addition* to the letter of invitation, not a way to avoid it.
*   **C: የቆይታ ጊዜን ለማረጋገጥ የደርሶ መልስ ቲኬት:**  Like the passport, this is a requirement, but not a method to bypass the main requirement of the letter of invitation.
*   **D: የዩኤስ ግሪን ካርድ:** The text states those *with* a US Green Card are *required* to visit the Ecuadorian consulate, not that it exempts them from the letter of invitation.



"
የኢኳዶር የጉዞ መስፈርቶች ያልተነደፉት ለምንድናቸው?,"The correct answer is **B: የተደራጀ የስደት ፍሰትን መጠበቅ**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the requirements are ""designed to regulate organized migratory flows between the two countries."" The letter of invitation and other requirements are a way for Ecuador to control who enters the country and prevent unregulated migration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የተጓዦችን ቁጥር በትንሹ ማቆየት:** While controlling migration *can* affect the number of travelers, the primary goal stated in the text isn't simply to reduce numbers, but to *manage* the flow.
*   **C: የተጓዥ ቆይታን ማረጋገጥ:** The return ticket requirement *helps* with this, but it's not the overarching reason for the entire set of rules.
*   **D: የፓስፖርቶችን ትክክለኛነት ማረጋገጥ:** The passport validity requirement ensures that, but again, it's a component of the larger goal of managing migration, not the main reason for the rules.

ከሚከተሉት ከአገር ውስጥ የበለጠ በውጭ ሀገር ዋጋ ያለው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: ከፍተኛ ፍሬሞች**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that high-end brand frames can be problematic – either being deceptively cheap and low quality (""እዚ ግባ የማይባሉ ርካሾች"") or being very expensive to import (""ብዙ ውድ ይሆና"").  This implies they are more expensive when purchased from abroad.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የአይን ምርመራ (Eye exams)** - The text suggests you can *save* money on eye exams by having them done at home and using an out-of-country prescription.
*   **C: የአይን ኢንሹራንስ (Eye insurance)** - The text doesn't discuss the cost of insurance being different between countries.
*   **D: የምርት ስም ያልሆኑ ፍሬሞች (Non-brand frames)** - The text states that cheaper frames are *more likely* to be found in countries with low labor costs, implying they are cheaper abroad.

በባዕድ አገር ከፍተኛ ደረጃ ያላቸውን ክፈፎች የመግዛት አደጋ ምን ሊሆን ይችላል?,"The correct answer is **C: የውሸት ሊሆኑ ይችላሉ (They might be counterfeit)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly warns about the possibility of getting ""fakes"" when buying from places that offer very low prices.**  It states that some cheap options might not be genuine.
* Let's look at why the other options are less likely to be the *main* risk:
    * **A: ተጨማሪ የዓይን ምርመራ ሊያስፈልግ ይችላል (Additional eye exams may be required):** While possible, the passage primarily focuses on the authenticity of the frames themselves, not issues with needing further eye checks.
    * **B: ማዘዙ ለተወሰኑ ፍሬሞች ላይሠራ ይችላል (The order might not work for certain frames):**  This isn't directly mentioned as a risk.
    * **D: ኢንሹራንስ ወጪውን ሊሸፍን አይችልም (Insurance might not cover the cost):**  The passage suggests using insurance *if* it covers the cost; the risk isn't that it *won't* cover it, but rather that you need a prescription anyway.

Therefore, the most significant risk highlighted in the passage regarding buying frames abroad is the potential for receiving counterfeit products."
በFalklands የመገበያያ ገንዘብ አጠቃቀምን በተመለከተ ከሚከተሉት መግለጫዎች ውስጥ የትኛው እውነት ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: ከFalkland ፓውንድ ባሻገር፣ የእንግሊዝ ፓውንድ በአጠቃላይ በጣም ተቀባይነት ያለው ገንዘብ ነው**.

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""የብሪታንያ ፓውንድ በአጠቃላይ በደሴቶቹ ላይ በማንኛውም ቦታ ተቀባይነት አላቸው..."" (British Pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the Islands...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text says credit cards and US dollars are *often* accepted on Stanley, not just credit cards and GBP on outer islands.
*   **B:** Stanley isn't the *only* place accepting USD; it's just commonly accepted there.
*   **C:** The text explicitly states you should exchange your money *before* leaving the islands (""የፋልክላንድን ገንዘብ ከዴሴቱ ውጪ መለወጥ የማይቻል ነገር ነው፤ ስለዚህ ደሴቱን ከመልቀቅዎ በፊት ገንዘብዎን ይለውጡ"" - Falkland money cannot be exchanged outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving)."
በንባቡ ላይ በመመስረት፣ ከአሜሪካ ወደ ፎክላንድ ሲጓዙ፣ ከክሬዲት ካርድ ሌላ የክፍያ ዓይነት የት ጠቃሚ ሊሆን ይችላል?,"The correct answer is **D: በመላ Stanley**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""የስታንሊ የክሬዲት ካርዶች እና የአሜሪካ ዶላርም እንዲሁ ብዙውን ጊዜ ተቀባይነት አላቸው"" (Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted). This means US dollars are likely to be useful in Stanley alongside credit cards.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በ FIC ምዕራባዊ መደብር** - The text mentions FIC West as a place to exchange money, not necessarily use US dollars.
*   **B: በሁሉም ደሴቶች** - The text doesn't state US dollars are widely accepted *throughout* the islands, only that British pounds are.
*   **C: ወጣ ያሉ ደሴቶች ውስጥ** - The text specifically warns that debit cards may not be accepted in outer islands.

ከቤተ መቅደሱ በዓላት ጋር ያልተገናኘ የትኛው ክስተት ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: የዝሆን መወለድ (Elephant birth)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Kerala temple festivals *feature* decorated elephants, orchestras, and events. This means elephants are *part of* the festivals, not the reason for them. It doesn't mention elephant births being celebrated as part of the temple festivals.
*   **B: የቅርጻቱ አመታዊ በዓል (The shrine's annual festival)** is directly mentioned as the main event.
*   **C: የመለኮት ልደት (Deity's birthday)** is specifically mentioned as a common reason for a festival.
*   **D: ቤተ መቅደሱን የሚያካትቱ ዋና ክስተቶች (Major events related to the shrine)** is a general description of what the festivals *are*.

Therefore, an elephant birth is the only option that isn't directly tied to the temple festivals described in the passage."
ያጌጡ ዝሆኖች የት ሊታዩ ይችላሉ?,"The correct answer is **A: ከህዳር መጨረሻ እስከ ሜይ አጋማሽ ድረስ በሁሉም ቦታ**.

Here's why:

The text states ""የኬራላ መቅደስ ክብረ በዓላት ባጌጡ ዝሆኖች መደበኛ አካሄድ..."". It also says these festivals happen from November to May half. Therefore, decorated elephants are seen *during* the Kerala temple festivals which take place during that timeframe, and thus are seen ""everywhere"" during those months.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: በቅርጻቱ ውስጥ** - This is too vague.
*   **C: በቅርጻት በዓላት ላይ በሰልፍ** - While they may be *in* processions, the text doesn’t specify only processions.
*   **D: በኬረላ ጎዳናዎች ላይ** - The text focuses on them being part of the temple festivals, not generally on the streets.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states, ""በአጠቃላይ ለመናገር ከኤ ወደ ቢ ለሚደረጉ ቀጥታ በረራዎች የቢዝነስ ወይም የመጀመሪያ ክፍል ወንበሮች ላይ ቅናሽ መፈለግ ሁላ ጥቅም የለውም።"" This directly implies that trying to find discounts is *not* a fruitful approach. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በድርጅትዎ በኩል ወጪ ማድረግ** - The passage doesn't suggest company expense leads to savings, only that the cost is high regardless.
*   **B: ከንግድ ስራ ይልቅ የመጀመሪያ ክፍል ቦታ ማስያዝ** - The passage states first class is *more* expensive than business class.
*   **C: ቀጥተኛ ያልሆነ የመጀመሪያ ደረጃ በረራ ቦታ ማስያዝ** - The passage focuses on *direct* flights and doesn't mention indirect ones.

በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ የተወሰኑ የታሪፍ ክፍሎችን ሲይዙ ለመፈለግ ጊዜ ማባከን ምን ሊሆን ይችላል?,"The correct answer is **C: ቅናሽ (Discount)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""በአጠቃላይ ለመናገር ከኤ ወደ ቢ ለሚደረጉ ቀጥታ በረራዎች የቢዝነስ ወይም የመጀመሪያ ክፍል ወንበሮች ላይ ቅናሽ መፈለግ ሁላ ጥቅም የለውም።"" (Generally speaking, searching for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B is usually not worth it.)

This directly implies that spending time trying to find a discount on these specific fares is likely a waste of time.

አጠቃላይ የታሪፍ ዋጋን ከአፍሪካ ከአለም ዙር ታሪፍ ጋር በማነፃፀር ምን መጨመር አያስፈልግም?,"The correct answer is **C: የአፍሪካ ቪዛ ዋጋ**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that when comparing the overall cost of traveling *to* Africa versus around the world, you need to remember to add costs like extra visas, departure taxes, and ground transportation for places *outside* of Africa.  

The question asks what cost doesn't need to be *added* when comparing.  The text doesn't mention needing to add a visa cost *for* Africa itself; it only mentions needing visas for destinations *outside* Africa.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ከአፍሪካ ውጭ ላሉ ቦታዎች ተጨማሪ ቪዛ ዋጋ** - The text *specifically* mentions adding visa costs for destinations outside Africa.
*   **B: በአፍሪካ ውስጥ የመነሻ ግብሮች ዋጋ** - The text explicitly states you need to factor in departure taxes.
*   **D: ከአፍሪካ ውጭ ላሉ አካባቢዎች የመሬት መጓጓዣ ዋጋ** -  The text explicitly states you need to factor in ground transportation costs for destinations outside Africa.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ከጊዜ ወደ ጊዜ ሱፐር ማርኬቶች በርካታ የተዘጋጁ የምግብ አይነቶችን እያገኙ ነው።"" (Over time, supermarkets have been acquiring a number of prepared food types.)  This directly answers the question of what more varied selection supermarkets have started to offer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ማይክሮ ዌቭ (Microwave):** While some prepared foods *come with* microwave instructions, microwaves themselves aren't what the supermarkets are offering as a varied selection.
* **C: የአከባቢ ምግብ ቤቶች (Local restaurants):** The passage mentions restaurants as sometimes being *within* supermarkets, but doesn't say the supermarkets are offering them as a varied selection *of their own*.
* **D: ተመጣጣኝ ዋጋዎች (Affordable prices):**  The passage mentions affordable prices in relation to the restaurants, but not as a new varied offering *from the supermarket itself*.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""አንዳንዶች ማይክሮዌቭ ወይም ሌላ ምግብ ማሞቂያ መንገድ ይሰጣሉ።"" (Some provide a microwave or other food warming method.) This directly links the supermarkets to offering microwaves for customers to heat up the ready-made food they purchase.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: የአከባቢ ምግብ ቤቶች (Local restaurants):** The passage mentions on-site food counters, but doesn't equate them to local restaurants.
* **B: ያነሰ የተለያየ ምርጫ (Less diverse choice):** The passage states the opposite - supermarkets are *increasing* their variety of prepared foods.
* **C: ጥሬ ምግብ (Raw food):** The passage is about *prepared* foods, not raw ingredients.

ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ ፈረንሳይኛ ተናጋሪ ቤልጂየም እና ስዊዘርላንድ የማይረዱት የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: አብዛኛው ፈረንሳይኛ በፈረንሳይ ይነገራል**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Belgian and Swiss French speakers *can* understand each other and even standard French despite some differences. It highlights differences in number systems and pronunciation, but says they are still familiar with the standard system through education.  Saying ""most French is spoken in France"" isn't something they *wouldn't* understand - it's just a factual statement, and not a linguistic barrier. The passage focuses on *how* they might have slight difficulties due to variations, not a complete inability to understand standard French because of where it's spoken.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: መደበኛ የፈረንሳይ የቁጥር ስርዓት** - They *can* understand this, even if they use a different system themselves.
*   **B: ልዩ የፈረንሳይኛ ቃላት** - The passage doesn't say they wouldn't understand different words, just that there are some slight variations.
*   **C: የተወሰኑ የፈረንሳይኛ ቃላት አጠራር** -  This is specifically mentioned as a difference, but they can still understand."

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""በቤልጅየም እና በስዊዘርላንድ የሚነገሩት የፈረንሣይኛ ዓይነቶች እርስ በእርሳቸው ለመረዳት የሚቻሉ ቢሆኑም በፈረንሳይ ከሚነገረው ፈረንሳይኛ በጥቂቱ ይለያሉ። በተለይም... የአንዳንድ ቃላት አጠራር በመጠኑም ቢሆን የተለየ ነው።"" (The French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland are mutually intelligible with French but differ slightly... specifically the pronunciation of *some* words is slightly different).  This means *not all* pronunciations are different, only some.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: የቁጥር ስርዓት** - The passage explicitly mentions differences in the numbering system.
* **C: መደበኛው ፈረንሳይኛ በትምህርት ቤቶች ያስተምራል** - The passage states that both Belgian and Swiss French speakers learn standard French in school.
* **D: የአንዳንድ የፈረንሳይኛ ቃላት አጻጻፍ** - While not directly stated, the slight differences imply that the spelling of some words might also vary.



"
የሐዘን ታሪፍ የማይሰጥህ በየትኛው ሁኔታ ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: WestJet እየበረሩ ከሆነ**.

Here's why:

The passage states that only a *few* airlines offer bereavement fares, and specifically lists Air Canada, Delta, and Lufthansa for flights from the US or Canada. WestJet is *not* on that list. Therefore, if you're flying WestJet, you won't be offered a bereavement fare.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage explicitly states you *must* book directly with the airline to get a bereavement fare.
*   **C:** Lufthansa *is* listed as an airline that offers bereavement fares.
*   **D:** Delta *is* listed as an airline that offers bereavement fares.



"

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states: ""in all cases, you have to book directly with the airline by phone."" This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ለቀብር ጉዞ ወጪን ይሸፍናሉ** - The passage states they reduce *last minute travel costs* for bereavement travel, not cover funeral expenses.
* **B: እነሱ በቀጥታ በአየር መንገዱ ድረ-ገጽ ላይ መመዝገብ አለባቸው** - The passage specifically says booking *cannot* be done online, it *must* be by phone.
* **C: የመጨረሻ ደቂቃ የጉዞ ወጪን ይሸፍናሉ** - While they *help* with last-minute costs, they don't fully *cover* them. They offer reduced fares.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that GPS apps on smartphones **may have limited or no functionality when you are outside of service range** or don't have internet data. A standalone GPS device doesn't rely on cellular data, so it will continue to work even when you are off the grid.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ገንዘብ ለመቆጠብ ሲሞክሩ** (When trying to save money) - The passage states that apps *can* save you money, making this a reason *for* using an app, not a standalone device.
* **B: የውሂብ ግንኙነት እንዳለህ እርግጠኛ ስትሆን** (When you are sure you have data connectivity) - This is a good condition for *using* the app, but not a reason to choose a standalone device *over* it.
* **D: መሣሪያ ለመከራየት በማይፈልጉበት ጊዜ** (When you don't want to rent a device) - Again, this is a situation where an app is a good alternative to renting, not a reason to use a standalone device.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that GPS apps on smartphones ""may be limited or unavailable if you don't have internet data for your phone or when you are out of service range.""  A standalone GPS device doesn't rely on cellular data.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ገንዘብ መቆጠብ** - The passage states using apps *can* save money.
*   **C: ክራይን ማስወገድ** - The passage mentions avoiding rental costs, which is a benefit of using an app, not a drawback.
*   **D: አድስ ካርታ መጋዛት አይጠብቅባችሁም** - The passage also mentions avoiding buying new maps, which is a benefit.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""You should ensure your registered agent is a Galapagos specialist with good knowledge of the different vessels. This ensures your unique needs and/or limitations are matched with the vessel’s particular comfort."" This directly supports the idea that working with a knowledgeable agent is key to finding a suitable ship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While traveling with a group *could* help, the passage doesn't mention this as a guarantee.
*   **B:** Booking during the low season might make it *easier* to find space, but doesn't guarantee a *suitable* ship.
*   **D:** Booking far in advance might secure a spot, but doesn't address matching your needs to the ship's features.

በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ እንግዶች ቁማር ለመጠበቅ ዘዴ ሆኖ ጥቅም ላይ ያልዋለ የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: የተትረፈረፈ የተፈጥሮ ብርሃን** (Abundant natural light).

Here's why:

The passage discusses casinos intentionally designing their environments to encourage guests to gamble longer and spend more money. It specifically mentions:

*   **Lack of windows and clocks:** To disorient guests and make them lose track of time.
*   **Difficult exits:**  To make it harder to leave.
*   **Free food, drinks, and entertainment:** To keep guests in a good mood and encourage them to stay.
*   **Free alcohol:**  Despite its impairment effects, as good gamblers know it's a disadvantage.

The passage does *not* mention manipulating natural light levels as a tactic.  The other options (B, C, and D) are directly stated in the text as methods casinos use.

Therefore, abundant natural light is the one thing *not* used to keep gamblers gambling."
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ብልህ ቁማርተኛ ምን መራቅ አለበት?,"The correct answer is **A: ከመጠን በላይ አልኮል መጠጣት** (Overconsumption of alcohol).

Here's why:

The passage states that casinos offer free alcohol, but also points out that ""alcohol impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the advantage of being sober.""  A smart gambler would therefore avoid excessive alcohol consumption to maintain clear thinking and make better decisions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ማንኛውንም ማበረታቻ መቀበል** (Accepting any incentives) - The passage mentions incentives like food and entertainment, but doesn't suggest avoiding them.
* **C: ሰዓቶችን ወይም ሰዓቶችን መፈተሽ** (Checking the hours or clocks) - The passage says casinos often *don't* have clocks, making this irrelevant.
* **D: ስለ ቅርብ መቻ መጠየቅ** (Asking about exits) - The passage mentions exits can be difficult to find, but doesn't suggest a smart gambler would specifically ask about them.

በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ የትኛው የንግግር ክፍል በአረፍተ ነገር መካከል በካፒታል ተጽፏል?,"The correct answer is **B: ስሞች**.

The passage explicitly states: ""ሁሉም ስሞች፣ ለእርስዎ ሳይ ከሚለው ቃል ጎን፣ በአረፍተ ነገር መሃል እንኳን ቢሆን፣ ሁሌም በአበይት ፊደላት ይጀምራሉ።"" This means all nouns are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ የስሞች አቢይነት የበለጠ አስቸጋሪ የሚያደርገው ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: መጻፍ (Writing)**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""...መጻፍ ግን በአንድ ስምን የሚወክል የቃል ቅርጽ ላይ ግስ ወይም ገላጭ እንደተጠቀምን ማወቅ ስለሚኖርብን ይወሳሰባል።"" This directly translates to ""...writing is worrisome because we need to know if a word form representing a noun is being used as a verb or adjective.""  This highlights the difficulty in writing when all nouns are capitalized, as it requires constant attention to grammatical function.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ማንበብ (Reading):** The passage suggests capitalization *helps* with reading, not makes it more difficult.
*   **B: በግሶች መሃል መለየት (Distinguishing between verbs):** The capitalization is to help *identify* nouns, not verbs.
*   **D: በእቃዎች መካከል መለየት (Distinguishing between objects):** This isn't discussed in the passage.

"""በማሌዥያ ገጠራማ አካባቢዎች የትኛው ምልክት ማለት """"ና"""" ማለት ነው?""","The correct answer is **A: አመልካች ጣትን ማጠፍ**. 

The passage states that in rural Malaysia, waving your hand with a pointed index finger is equivalent to saying ""no"", similar to how it's used offensively in some Western countries. This corresponds to ""folding the index finger.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ማውለብለብ (Waving):** The passage says general waving means ""peace"" in many parts of the world, but ""no"" in Malaysia.
* **C: ኢጅ ከፍ ማድረግ (Raising a hand):** Not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: አውራ ጣትን ወደላይ ማሳየት (Showing the little finger):** Not mentioned in the passage.

Here's why:

The passage states that in Spain, an Englishman might interpret waving with the hand circling (rather than waving *to* someone) as a ""no"" sign.  This implies that waving with the palm facing outwards is the standard way to wave *to* someone, and therefore could be misinterpreted as a ""come back"" or ""return"" gesture, as it's the normal greeting gesture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: መዳፉን ወደ ውስጥ በማየት ማወዛወዝ (Waving with the palm facing inwards)** - The passage specifically says this is interpreted as ""no"" in Spain.
*   **B: አመልካች ጣት መታጠፍ (Snapping fingers)** - This isn't mentioned in the passage at all.
*   **D: ጭንቅላትን በመነቅነቅ (Nodding the head)** - This is a general sign of agreement, not specifically related to the waving context.

The passage explicitly states ""በበረዶ ግግር ክምሮች የተረጋጉ አይደሉም ፣ ከተራራው ይወርዳሉ እንጂ። ይህ በበረዶ ድልድዮች ሊደበቁ የሚችሉትን ስንጥቆች ፣ ክፍተቶችን ሊያስከትል ይችላል።"" (Ice formations are not stable, they descend from the mountain instead. This can create cracks and openings that can be hidden by ice bridges).  This directly links unstable ice formations to the creation of cracks (ስንጥቆች).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የበረዶ ድልድዮች (Ice bridges)**: The passage states ice bridges *hide* cracks, they don't *cause* them.
*   **C: የበረዶ ዋሻዎች መሰባበር (Collapse of ice caves)**: While ice caves collapsing can create cracks, the passage focuses on the overall instability of the formations as the primary cause.
*   **D: ልቅ ብሎኮች (Loose blocks)**: Loose blocks are a *result* of the instability, not the initial cause of the cracks.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""This can cause cracks, openings that can be hidden by ice bridges."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: የበረዶ ዋሻ (Ice cave):** The passage states ice cave *walls and ceilings* can collapse, not the cave itself being hidden.
* **C: ግርግዳ (Glacier):** The passage discusses the instability of glacier seracs, but doesn't say glaciers are hidden by ice bridges.
* **D: ጥልቅ ማገጃ (Deep pit):** This isn't mentioned in the passage at all.

The text states: ""ከጎማ ውጭ የሚደረጉ ማናቸውም ጉብኝቶች በሰሜን ኪቪ አውራጃ የቀጠለውን የውጊያ ሁኔታ ለመረዳት ጥናት መደረግ አለባቸው።"" (Any trips outside of Goma should be researched to understand the ongoing conflict situation in the North Kivu province.) This directly indicates that travelers need to take extra precautions when venturing *outside* of Goma.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የ Nyiragongo ቮልካኖ** - The text mentions Nyiragongo volcano, but only as a destination *from* Goma, not a place requiring extra caution *before* visiting.
*   **C: መሃል ከተማ** - The text states the center of the city was damaged by a volcanic eruption, but doesn't suggest it's currently unsafe.

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...ጉብኝቶች በሰሜን ኪቪ አውራጃ የቀጠለውን የውጊያ ሁኔታ ለመረዳት ጥናት መደረግ አለባቸው"" (Any trips outside of Goma should research the ongoing conflict in North Kivu). This implies the situation is *not* something to be considered ""exciting"" or a tourist attraction, but rather a safety concern that requires investigation.

Let's look at why the other options are good advice based on the text:

* **B:** The passage states Goma is ""one of the most affordable mountain gorilla treks in Africa.""
* **C:** The passage mentions using ""boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around.""
* **D:** The passage says Goma is a ""base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano.""

በነሐሴ ወር የመጀመሪያ ቀን የባክካንትሪ ፈቃድ መቼ ይገኛል?,"The correct answer is **B: April 1**.

Here's why:

The passage states that permits for backcountry access become available four months before the desired start date, on the 1st of the month.  Since the question asks about a permit for August 1st, you need to count back four months:

*   July 1st (1 month back)
*   June 1st (2 months back)
*   May 1st (3 months back)
*   April 1st (4 months back)

Therefore, the permits become available on April 1st."
ካንየን ለመጠበቅ ምን ፖሊሲ ተቀምጧል?,"The correct answer is **D: የተወሰነ የፍቃዶች ብዛት**.

Here's why:

The text states that permits are *limited* to protect the canyon. This means there isn't an unlimited number of permits available - there's a defined quantity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: መጀመሪያ የመጣ፣ መጀመሪያ ያገለገለ የፈቃድ ስርዓት** - While this *is* how the most popular spots are allocated, it's not the overarching policy to protect the canyon. It's a *method* of distributing the limited permits.
*   **B: ፈቃዶች በጃንዋሪ 1 ላይ ብቻ ይገኛሉ** - Permits *become available* on the 1st of the month, four months in advance, not *only* on January 1st.
*   **C: ፍቃዶችን ማግኘት የሚቻለው በእግረኛ መግቢያ ጥያቄዎች ብቻ ነው** - The text doesn't limit how permits are requested, only that they are competitive.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states these hotels are characterized by their *lack* of modern amenities and a certain ""gracious aging."" Recent renovations and modern upgrades would contradict this description.

Let's look at why the other options are likely to be found in these hotels:

*   **A: ኮክቴል ባር (Cocktail bar):** The passage mentions that wealthy and famous people would spend evenings at dinners and dances, implying a social atmosphere where a cocktail bar would fit in.
*   **B: በቦታው ላይ የሚገኝ የጎርሜት ምግብ ቤት (Gourmet restaurant on site):** Dinners are specifically mentioned as a common activity for guests, suggesting a high-quality dining establishment.
*   **C: የታወቁ ወይም የሚታወቁ እንግዶች (Famous or notable guests):** The passage explicitly states that these hotels hosted wealthy, famous people and even visiting dignitaries.

Here's why:

The passage describes hotels that are characterized by their history, age, and former clientele of wealthy and famous individuals. These hotels are about *experience* and *nostalgia*, not necessarily affordability.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: በንብረቱ ውስጥ ሁሉ ጥንታዊ የቤት ዕቃዎች (Antique furniture throughout the property):** This aligns with the description of the hotels' character - being old and full of history.
*   **B: ታዋቂ ሼፍ ያለው ምግብ ቤት (Restaurant with a renowned chef):**  The passage mentions elaborate dinners and parties were common, suggesting a focus on fine dining.
*   **C: የምሽት መዝናኛ የሚያቀርብ ላውንጅ (Lounge offering evening entertainment):** The passage references evening gatherings and dances, indicating a focus on entertainment.

The passage implies these hotels cater to a luxury market and would not prioritize *reasonable rates*. In fact, the very nature of these establishments suggests they are likely quite expensive."

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ከላይ እንደተገለፀው """"ኤስኪሞ"""" የሚለው ቃል በዩናይትድ ስቴትስ ተቀባይነት ቢኖረውም በሌሎች ዩስ ያልሆኑ የአርክቲክ ሰዎች በተለይም በካናዳ እንደፀያፍ ይቆጠራል። የግሪንላንድ ተወላጆች ይህንን ቃል ሲጠቀሙ ቢሰሙም፣ የውጭ ዜጎች ሊጠቀሙበት አይገባም።"" This directly advises visitors to *avoid* using the term ""Eskimo"" when referring to the indigenous people of Greenland.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage states crime is *not* common in Greenland.
*   **B:** The passage explicitly advises bringing *warm* clothing due to the cold climate.
*   **C:** The passage states Greenland is well-connected with internet access, so a lack of connectivity isn't something to avoid.

* **The passage states:** ""በበጋ ወቅት በጣም ረጅም ቀናት በቂ እንቅልፍ ማግኘት እና ተጓዳኝ የጤና ችግሮች ሊመሩ ይችላሉ። በቀዝቃዛ ወቅት ግሪንላንድን የሚጎበኙ ከሆነ (ወደ ሰሜኑ በሄዱ ቁጥር ቅዝቃዜው ይጨምራል)፣ በቂ የሆነ ልብሶችን ማምጣት አስፈላጊ ነው፡፡"" This directly points to the weather (long days in summer and cold temperatures in general) as a potential issue for unprepared travelers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: የኖርዲክ ትንኞች:** The passage says they are annoying but don't transmit diseases, so they're a nuisance, not a major problem.
* **B: ወንጀል:** The passage explicitly states that crime is rare in Greenland.
* **D: አከባቢ:** The passage doesn't mention the environment being a problem for visitors.

ከሚከተሉት የትኛው አሁን እንደ ማዕከላዊ አደባባይ ጥቅም ላይ ይውላል?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The text states: ""Now it serves as a central plaza, and many things happen there all day and night."" and refers to ""it"" as the Jardín de la Unión. 

The other options are described as:

*   **The Alley of the Kiss (Callejon del Beso):** A narrow alley with a love story.
*   **Templo de San Diego:** A ruin that was once part of a 17th-century convent.
*   **Callejon del Beso:** Same as ""The Alley of the Kiss"".



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ በJardín de la Unión የማይገኝ የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: የቆየ የገዳም ሕንፃ**.

Here's why:

The text states that the Jardín de la Unión *was built as a middle ground for a 17th-century monastery*, and that the *Templo de San Diego is the only remnant* of that monastery. This means the original monastery building itself is no longer there, only a remaining part (the temple). Therefore, a complete, old monastery building is *not* found in the Jardín de la Unión.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the text:

*   **A: ማዕከላዊ gazebo ከኮንሰርቶች ጋር** - The text explicitly mentions ""a small gazebo in the center...where free concerts are mostly held.""
*   **B: የድሮ የፍቅር ታሪክ ቤት** - The text describes Callejon del Beso as a house with a love story.
*   **C: የአትክልት ቦታ ፊት ለፊት ያሉ ምግብ ቤቶች** - The text states ""several restaurants occupy the garden area."""

Here's why:

The passage states, ""ትንንሽ ልጆች ያሏቸው ቤተሰቦች ብዙ ዝግጅት የሚያስፈልጋቸው ሊሆን ይችላል፣ ነገር ግን ሕፃናት እና ለትምህርት ያልደረሱ ልጆች ጨምሮ ከቤት ውጭ ማሳለፍ በቀላሉ የሚቻል ነው።"" This directly contradicts option D, which claims day hikes are *not* a suitable outdoor activity for families with children.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A:** The passage states, ""For a day hike on an easy trail, minimal preparations are needed.""
*   **B:** The passage defines a day hike as ranging ""from under a mile to a longer distance that can be covered in a single day.""
*   **C:** The passage says, ""Anyone with a moderate level of fitness can enjoy them.""



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ አንድ ቀን የእግር ጉዞ በጣም አነስተኛ ዝግጅት የሚያስፈልገው መቼ ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: ቀላል መንገድን ሲያካትት**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""A day hike requires small preparations on an easy trail, and anyone with moderate fitness can enjoy them."" This directly links minimal preparation to hiking on an easy trail.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ተጓዡ የአካል ብቃት እንቅስቃሴ ሲያደርግ** - The passage states moderate fitness is *enough* for a day hike, but doesn't say preparation is lessened *because* someone is fit.
*   **C: ልጆች በእግር ጉዞ ላይ ሲሆኑ** - The passage actually says hiking with children *requires more* preparation.
*   **D: የእግር ጉዞው ይበልጥ ተፈጥሯዊ በሆነ አካባቢ ውስጥ በሚሆንበት ጊዜ** - The passage doesn't link the naturalness of the environment to the amount of preparation needed."

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""in Rogaland and Agder these are mostly called 'hei', meaning heather-covered moorland.""  This directly indicates that the moorlands in these regions are typically covered in heather.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ዛፎች አሏቸው (They have trees):** The passage specifically describes both ""vider"" and ""hei"" as treeless areas.
* **B: ምንም fjords የለም (No fjords):** The passage doesn't mention anything about the absence of fjords in Rogaland or Agder.  It focuses on the difference in the *moorland* areas.
* **C: አምባዎቹ በአብዛኛው እኩል ናቸው (The moorlands are mostly the same):** The passage points out a difference in *naming* (""vider"" vs ""hei"") and a difference in *cover* (treeless vs. heather-covered), so they are not the same.



"

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that ""ቪዴ"" (and ""ሄይ"") are **ዛፍ አልባ** (treeless) areas. Therefore, a forested plateau would be unusual in the typical Norwegian landscape described.
*   The passage *does* describe **ክፍት ቦታዎች** (open spaces) as being common (""ቪዴ"" and ""ሄይ"" are both types of open areas).
*   **ቁልቁል ገደላማ** (rugged mountains) and **ሸለቆዎች** (valleys) are stated to be characteristic of Norway's landscape.
*   While ""ሞርላንድስ"" isn't directly mentioned, it can be inferred to be a part of the open landscape."
የበረዶ ላይ መንሸራተት ፍላጎት ያላቸው ቱሪስቶች ወደ ኮረብታ ጣቢያዎች መሄድ ያለባቸው መቼ ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: በክረምት**.

The passage explicitly states that hill stations receive a healthy amount of snow during the winter season and host activities like skiing and ice skating. This directly answers the question of when tourists interested in ice-related activities should visit."
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ በኮረብታው ጣቢያዎች ብዙ ቱሪስቶች የሚበዙት መቼ ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: በህንዶች በጋ ግዜ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""P: ለኮረብታ ጣቢያዎች የቱሪስት ወቅት በአጠቃላይ በሕንድ የበጋ ወቅት በጣም ከፍተኛ ነው።"" (For hill stations, the tourist season is generally very high during the Indian summer.)

While the passage *also* mentions winter tourism, it specifically highlights that the *peak* season is during the Indian summer. Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer based on the given text.

እርዳታ ለመፈለግ ጀልባ ለማግኘት ተስፋ ካደረጉ ምን ከማድረግ መቆጠብ አለብዎት?,"The correct answer is **D: የጀልባ ተጓዦችን ችላ ማለት**.

Here's why:

The prompt (P) explicitly states you should try to **talk to as many people as possible** and offer help to those looking for rides. Ignoring potential passengers (የጀልባ ተጓዦችን ችላ ማለት) would directly contradict the instructions and prevent you from gathering the information needed to find the right connection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ወደ ላይ እና ወደ ታች መራመድ (Pacing up and down)**: The prompt encourages being *seen* and available, which includes moving around the port.
*   **B: ካፒቴኖች ጋር ጓደኝነት (Befriending captains)**: Building relationships is helpful and implied in making connections.
*   **C: የእርስዎን አገልግሎቶች ማስተዋወቅ (Promoting your services)**:  Offering help (like guiding, connecting people) *is* promoting your ability to facilitate rides.



"
እርዳታ የሚያስፈልገው ጀልባ ሲፈልጉ በባህር ዳርቻዎች ዙሪያ ምን ማድረግ አለብዎት?,"The correct answer is **A: ከመርከበኞች ጋር ግንኙነት ያድርጉ (Connect with sailors)**.

Here's why:

The prompt (P) explicitly states you should ""try to speak to as many people as possible,"" ""offer to help,"" and ""try to meet with sailors in the coffee shop."" This all points to actively engaging with sailors to gather information and find someone needing assistance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: በራዳር ስር ይቆዩ (Stay under the radar)** - This is the opposite of what the prompt suggests. You need to be visible and communicative.
* **C: ጀልባቸውን በሚያጸዱበት ጊዜ ሰዎችን ብቻ ቅረብ (Only approach people when they are cleaning their boats)** - This is too limiting. The prompt encourages broader interaction.
* **D: ከባልንጀሮቻቸው ቺኮች አስወግዱ (Remove the chips from their companions)** - This is nonsensical and unrelated to the task.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""አብዛኛው የሆንግ ኮንግ ደሴት የከተማ ልማት በሰሜናዊው ዳርቻ ላይ ከተመለሰው መሬት ላይ ተጠቅጥቋል። ይህ የእንግሊዝ ቅኝ ገዥዎች እንደራሳቸው የወሰዱት ቦታ ነው እናም ስለዚህ የክልሉን የቅኝ ግዛት ዘመን ማስረጃ ከፈለጉ ይህ ለመጀመር ጥሩ ቦታ ነው።"" This directly links the northern shore to evidence of the colonial period.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: የ Kowloon የውሃ ዳርቻ:** The passage recommends going to the Kowloon waterfront *to get the best views of* Hong Kong Island, not to explore its colonial history.
* **C: ዳውንታውን ሆንግ ኮንግ:** While downtown is part of the island, the passage doesn't specifically connect it to colonial history.
* **D: Victoria Harbor:**  Victoria Harbor is mentioned for its scenic beauty, but not for its historical connection to colonialism.



"
ለአስደናቂ እይታዎች ቅድሚያ የሚሰጠውን ቱሪስት የሚስበው የትኛው ቦታ ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ሆንግ ኮንግ ደሴት (Hong Kong Island)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""የሆንግ ኮንግ ደሴት የሆንግ ኮንግ ግዛት ስያሜ የሰጠው ሲሆን ብዙ ቱሪስቶች እንደ ዋና ትኩረት የሚመለከቱት ቦታ ነው።"" which translates to ""Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the Hong Kong territory and is the main focus for many tourists.""

While Victoria Harbor offers great views *of* Hong Kong Island, and Kowloon waterfront is a good place *to see* Hong Kong Island, the island itself is the primary tourist attraction mentioned in the text.

የነጂው እግር በመቀስቀስ ውስጥ የመያዝ አደጋን ለመቀነስ የሚያግዙ አንዳንድ ኮርቻዎች ምን አሏቸው?,"The correct answer is **B: የደህንነት አሞሌዎች**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ቀጣይ፣ አንዳንድ ኮርቻዎች፣ በተለይ የእንግሊዝ ኮርቻዎች፣ ሊወድቅ ባለ ጋላቢ ወደኋላ ሲሳብ የእርካብ ቆዳ ከኮርቻው ላይ እንዲወርድ የሚያስችሉ **መከላከያ ዘንጎች** አሏቸው.""  These safety straps are designed to prevent the rider's foot from getting caught in the stirrup if they fall.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ጠባብ ጫማዎች** - The passage mentions boots with *smooth and narrow soles* are used with many stirrups, but it doesn’t say they prevent entrapment.
*   **C: የቆዳ መቀስቀሻዎች** - This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: የበለጠ መረጋጋት** - Stirrups *provide* more stability, but this isn’t a feature that *prevents* entrapment.

Here's why:

The passage states that many stirrups have heels and smooth, narrow soles on their stirrup boots. This design helps prevent the rider's foot from getting stuck in the stirrup, which is a safety concern. Therefore, a narrow sole is a key feature for rider safety.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ቆዳ:** While stirrup leathers are made of leather, the passage doesn't highlight leather *on the boot itself* as a safety feature.
*   **C: ሂል:** The passage mentions heels *on the stirrups*, not on the boots, as a feature.
*   **D: ሰፊ መርገጫ:** A wide sole would actually *increase* the risk of a foot getting stuck.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that hospitality exchange networks ""connect travelers with locals in the cities they visit."" This connection is for finding **accommodation** (a place to stay).
* While the example of KC Fenton *eventually* found a place to stay, the core function of these networks is facilitating connections for lodging.
* The other options are not the primary service offered:
    * **B: ርካሽ በረራዋች** - KC Fenton got a free ticket, but the networks don't generally provide cheap flights.
    * **C: በአካባቢ አስጎብኚዎች የተሰጡ ጉብኝቶች** - The text doesn't mention guided tours.
    * **D: ተመሳሳዩን መድረሻ ከሚጎበኙ ሌሎች መንገደኞች ጋር ግንኙነቶች** - While this *might* happen, it's not the network's main purpose.

Here's why:

The text states that lists of available hosts *are* provided to travelers *with* references and reviews. This implies hosts provide references, not travelers. The text doesn't say travelers always give references *to* the hosts.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

*   **B: አንዳንድ አውታረ መረቦች ተጨማሪ የተጓዦች ማረጋገጫ ሊፈልጉ ይችላሉ** - The text states ""some networks... may ask additional verification questions.""
*   **C: ተጓዦች በመድረሻ ከተማ ውስጥ የሚገኙ የአስተናጋጆች ዝርዝር ይሰጣቸዋል** - The text says ""lists of available hosts are printed or available online.""
*   **D: የአካባቢ አስተናጋጆች ግምገማዎች አንዳንድ ጊዜ ለተጓዦች ይገኛሉ** - The text states that lists include ""references and reviews.""

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that families with children are *uncommon* in hostels. The other options (young adults, solo travelers, and people in their 30s) are all groups that the passage suggests *can* be found in hostels. Therefore, a guest traveling with small children is the least likely to be found in a standard hostel setting."

Here's why:

* **The passage states hostels ""mainly serve young people, those in their twenties.""** This makes a group of 22-year-olds the most likely hostel candidates.
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **A:** The passage states families with children are *uncommon* in hostels.
    * **C:** While older travelers *can* be found in hostels, the focus is on younger people.
    * **D:** Similar to A, families with children are not typical hostel guests.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states that ""most boomerangs in Australia are actually non-returning"" and that only a ""moderate return"" is needed to learn how to throw one that comes back. This directly supports the idea that not all boomerangs return.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በትክክል ከተጣለ ሁልጊዜ ወደ እጅዎ ይመለሳል (If thrown correctly, it always returns to your hand)** - The passage contradicts this, stating many do *not* return.
*   **B: ከቱሪስቶች ይልቅ በአካባቢው ነዋሪዎች ዘንድ ታዋቂ ነው (It is more popular among locals than tourists)** - The passage doesn't mention the popularity among locals versus tourists, only that tourists *want* to learn to throw them.
*   **C: በአውስትራሊያ ውስጥ ብዙ ቡሜራንጎች የሉም (There aren't many boomerangs in Australia)** - The passage implies they are readily available, as it discusses many being non-returning.

The passage specifically states that ""ጃቫውያን የሚወዱት ዋና ማጣፈጫዎች ... ስኳር (በተለይ የጃቫውያን ኮኮናት ስኳር)"" are key to Javanese cuisine. Therefore, coconut sugar is the most frequently used sweetener in Javanese food, according to the text."

The passage states: ""ተላላፊ በሽታ ማለት በታመመ ሰው አካባቢ በመሆን በቀላሉ የሚተላለፍ በሽታ ነው።"" This directly translates to ""An infectious disease is a disease that is easily transmitted by being around a sick person.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ፓቶጂን (Pathogen)** - Pathogens *cause* infectious diseases, but they aren't *how* the disease is transmitted.
*   **C: ባክቴሪያ (Bacteria)** - Bacteria are a *type* of pathogen, not the method of transmission.

ምንባቡ እንደሚለው፣ ተላላፊ በሽታ መንስኤ ምን የማይታወቅ ነገር ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: ቫይረሶች**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ተላላፊ በሽታ እንደ ቫይረስ፣ ባክቴሪያ፣ ፈንገስ ወይም ሌሎች ፓራሳይቶች ባሉ ፓቶጅን የሚከሰት በሽታ ነው።"" This translates to ""An infectious disease is a disease caused by pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, or other parasites."" 

While bacteria and fungi *can* cause infectious diseases, the passage specifically lists **viruses** as one of the causes. The question asks for a *cause* of infectious diseases according to the text.

በየትኛው ሁኔታ ከግል VPN አቅራቢው ይልቅ የድር ፕሮክሲ መምረጥ ለተጠቃሚው በቂ ይሆናል?,"The correct answer is **C: ተጠቃሚው በዋነኛነት የ http ትራፊክን እየቀየረ ነው**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""VPNs redirect *all* internet traffic, not just HTTP."" This highlights a key difference between VPNs and web proxies. Web proxies primarily handle HTTP traffic.
* **Therefore:** If a user *only* needs to redirect HTTP traffic, a web proxy would be sufficient, and the advantages of a VPN (handling all traffic, better speed, better security) wouldn't be necessary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage specifically states VPNs are better because they redirect *all* traffic.
* **B:** VPNs are described as being *better* at avoiding censorship and tracking.
* **D:** VPNs offer *higher* bandwidth and better quality of service, making them the better choice for high-bandwidth activities.

በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ስለ VPN እና የድር ፕሮክሲዎች ከሚከተሉት መግለጫዎች ውስጥ እውነት ያልሆነው የትኛው ነው?,"መልሱ D ነው።

ሌሎች አማራጮች በባቡ ላይ በተጠቀሰው መሰረት ትክክለኛ ናቸው፡

*   A: VPNዎች በተለምዶ ከድር ፕሮክሲዎች የበለጠ ከፍተኛ የመተላለፊያ ይዘት ይሰጣሉ - በትክክል
*   B: የድር ፕሮክሲዎች ሁሉንም የድር ትራፊክ አቅጣጫ መቀየር አይችሉም - በትክክል (http ብቻውን ነው የሚቀይሩት)

አንድ ሰው ከቅርብ አካባቢው ውጭ የስልክ ኩባንያ እንዲጠቀም ምን ይፈቅዳል?,"The correct answer is **C: ሳቴላይት**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...in locations like a cabin, in the Alaskan wilderness getting satellite internet access and being in sunny Arizona... choose a number that reflects that."" This directly links satellite connection to being able to use a phone number not tied to your physical location.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: የበይነመረብ ጥሪዎች (Internet calls):** While internet calls allow communication regardless of location, they don't *provide* a phone number unrelated to your area.
* **B: አለማቀፍ ስልክ ቁጥሮች (International phone numbers):** The passage states you often have to *buy* an international number separately, and it's not the primary way to avoid location-based restrictions.
* **D: PSTN ስልኮች (PSTN phones):** PSTN phones are traditional landlines and are *tied* to a specific location. The passage contrasts them with the flexibility of satellite connections.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ የተወሰኑ ጥሪዎችን ለመቀበል ምን መደረግ አለበት?,"The correct answer is **A: ዓለም አቀፍ ቁጥር ይግዙ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Usually, PSTN phones require you to purchase an international number separately if you want someone to be able to call you."" This directly answers the question of what needs to be done to receive certain calls.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: የአገር ውስጥ የስልክ ኩባንያ ይጠቀሙ** - The passage suggests *avoiding* local phone companies if you're not in the area.
*   **C: ከአካባቢዎ ማህበረሰብ ቁጥር ያግኙ** - The passage states there's no *requirement* to get a local number.
*   **D: የ PSTN ስልክ ይግዙ** - The passage implies you *already have* a PSTN phone and need an additional number *for* it."
ከሚከተሉት የጣሊያን ቃላትን አጠራር በትክክል የማይገልጸው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: የአብዛኞቹ ቃላት አጠራር በሚከተለው አናባቢ ይለያያል**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the pronunciation *can* vary based on the following vowel, but it emphasizes the need for *careful attention* to 'c' and 'g' and the distinction between single and double 'r'. It doesn’t say that pronunciation *always* depends on the following vowel.  Options A, B, and C are all directly supported by the text.

*   **A:** The text explicitly states the difference between single and double 'r'.
*   **B:** The text starts by saying Italian pronunciation is relatively easy because words are generally pronounced as they are written.
*   **C:** The text directly calls out 'c' and 'g' as letters requiring careful attention.

Therefore, option D is the statement the passage *doesn't* fully support."
ከዘመናዊው ቀን በፊት ከሚከተሉት የኢዝሚር ባህሪዎች ውስጥ የትኛው ነው የመጣው?,"The correct answer is **D: በቀይ የተሸፈኑ ጣሪያዎች**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern marinas are juxtaposed with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century bazaar and old mosques and churches."" This directly indicates that the red-tiled roofs are a traditional element *existing before* the modern developments.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሰፊ ቦልቫርዶች (Wide boulevards)** - These are described as part of the modern city.
*   **B: የመስታወት ፊት የሚያሳዩ ሕንፃዎች (Glass-fronted buildings)** - These are specifically mentioned as modern.
*   **C: የገበያ ማዕከላት (Shopping malls)** - These are also described as modern marinas."
ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ የIzmir ትክክለኛ ባህሪ ያልሆነው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: ከባቢ አየር ባህላዊ ቱርክን ያንፀባርቃል**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Izmir has ""more of a Mediterranean European feel"" rather than a traditional Turkish one. This directly contradicts option B.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: ከተማዋ ትልቅ የባህር ወሽመጥ ትገኛለች** - The passage says Izmir is ""surrounded by a large bay.""
*   **C: ሁለቱንም ዘመናዊ የገበያ ማዕከሎች እና የቆዩ ቤተክርስቲያኖችን ማግኘት ይችላሉ** - The passage mentions ""modern shopping centers"" and ""older churches and mosques.""
*   **D: በቱርክ ውስጥ ሁለተኛው ትልቁ ወደብ አለው** - The passage states Izmir is the ""second largest port in Turkey."""
hanami የሚለው ቃል የሚያመለክተው ምንን ማየት ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: እምቡጥ አበባ**.

Here's why:

The text states ""ሃናሚ ተብሎ የሚታወቀው፣ የቼሪ አበባ ምልከታ..."" which directly translates to ""Hanami, known as cherry blossom viewing..."".  Therefore, hanami refers to viewing cherry blossoms (እምቡጥ አበባ).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: የጃፓን መኳንንት:** While hanami *was* initially associated with the imperial court, it doesn't mean hanami *is* the viewing of Japanese nobility.
* **C: የፕለም አበባዎች:** The text says the *concept* originated with plum blossoms, but hanami itself is about cherry blossoms.
* **D: ኢምፔሪያል ፍርድ ቤት:** Similar to option B, the imperial court was involved in early celebrations, but isn't what hanami *is*.



"
የእንቡጥ አበቦችን ለማየት የተሰጡ የመጀመሪያ ፓርቲዎችን ማን ያስተናገደው?,"The correct answer is **C: የጃፓን እምፔረር**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the first cherry blossom viewing celebrations in Japan were around the emperor and other imperial court nobles. This directly points to the Japanese emperor hosting the initial parties.

በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ከሚከተሉት የኢየሩሳሌም ገጽታዎች መካከል ቱሪዝምን የመሳብ እድሉ አነስተኛ የሆነው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: የእስራኤል ዋና ከተማ ሆናለች**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states many countries and the United Nations *do not* recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. This political dispute, while significant, doesn't directly contribute to its appeal as a tourist destination.
*   The passage explicitly highlights **A (religious significance), C (cultural offerings), and D (historical sites)** as key reasons why Jerusalem is a major tourist destination. These are all attractions that draw visitors.

Therefore, being the capital (which is contested) is the least likely factor to attract tourists based on the information provided in the passage."
ከሚከተሉት ኢየሩሳሌም የምትታወቅበት ክፍል ውስጥ ያልተጠቀሰው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: የፖሎቲካ ጫና (Political pressure)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    *   **አስደናቂ ታሪክ (Amazing history):** ""ከተማው አስደናቂ ሺህ አመታት የቆየ ታሪክ አላት""
    *   **ሃይማኖታዊ ጠቀሜታ (Religious significance):** ""ከተማው ለሶስት መነኮሳዊ ሀይማኖቶች የተቀደሰ ነው""
    *   **የባህል ቦታዎች (Cultural sites):** ""ኢየሩሳሌም ብዙ ታሪካዊ፣ አርኪኦሎጂካዊ ፣ ባህላዊ ቦታዎች አሏት""

*   **የፖሎቲካ ጫና (Political pressure)** is *implied* by the statement that many countries and the UN do not recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, but it is not directly stated as a characteristic *of* Jerusalem itself. It's a consequence of the city's status, not a defining feature.

Therefore, political pressure is the aspect not directly mentioned as something Jerusalem is known for within the provided text."
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ የትኛው አይነት ተጓዥ የዱር ካርድ በመግዛት የማይጠቅም ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: Kruger National Parkን ብቻ የሚጎበኝ መንገደኛ**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Wild Card offers entrance options for parks *and* all SANParks. If someone is *only* visiting Kruger National Park, they are not benefiting from the broader access the Wild Card provides. They would likely pay less by simply paying the daily conservation and entrance fees for Kruger alone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** A traveler planning to visit as many SANParks as possible would greatly benefit from the Wild Card.
*   **C:** A budget traveler concerned about park fees would find the Wild Card potentially cost-saving if they visit multiple parks.
*   **D:** A traveler visiting Kruger and at least one other reserve would find the Wild Card beneficial.

የKruger ብሔራዊ ፓርክን በትክክል የማይገልጸው የትኛው መግለጫ ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ከደቡብ አፍሪካ ብሔራዊ ፓርኮች ውስጥ ትንሹ ነው**.

Here's why:

The passage states Kruger National Park covers 19,500 km². This is a very large area, meaning it's *not* the smallest of South Africa's national parks. In fact, it's one of the largest.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: እንደ ዋና የደቡብ አፍሪካ መስህብ ይቆጠራል** - The passage explicitly states this: ""This is one of South Africa’s main attractions"".
*   **B: የዱር አራዊት በፓርኩ በርካታ ኢኮዞኖች መካከል ይለያያል** - The passage mentions it's divided into 14 different eco-zones, each with different wildlife.
*   **D: የዱር ካርድ በመግዛት ለጎብኚዎች ተደራሽ ነው** - The passage suggests buying a Wild Card can be beneficial for entry to parks like Kruger.

ከሚከተሉት የተራራው ገደላማ ቦታዎች ላይ ለወጣቶች አደጋ ሊያደርስ የሚችለው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: እርጥባማ ሁኔታዎች (Wet conditions)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""ተለይ ደግሞ እርጥብ ሲሆን በጣም በፍጥነት አደገኛ ሊሆን ስለሚችል።"" (Especially when wet, it can become very dangerous quickly.) This directly links wet conditions to increased danger on the mountain.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: መሰረተ ድንጋይ (Loose stones):** While loose stones are mentioned as a hazard, the passage says there are ropes to help in those areas, mitigating the risk.
*   **C: ትንሽ ዋሻ (Small cave):** The cave is described as being small and tight, which is an obstacle, but not explicitly dangerous.
*   **D: የብረት ገመዶች (Metal cables):** The metal cables *help* with safety by providing handholds.

ከሚከተሉት መግለጫዎች በንባቡ ላይ የተገለጸውን የMachu Picchu ተራራ መውጣት በትክክል የማያንጸባርቀው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: በሁሉም የሾለኞቹ ክፍሎች ውስጥ ምንም የእጅ መውጫዎች የሉም**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states: ""...in the steeper sections, cables provide a supportive handhold."" This directly contradicts option B, which claims there are *no* handholds in any of the steeper sections.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: ብቃት ያላቸው ተንሸራታቾች እንኳን ትንፋሽ ሊያጡ ይችላሉ** - The passage says: ""you should expect to get breathless...""
*   **C: ከላይ ባለው ዋሻ ውስጥ ማለፍ አለብህ** - The passage states: ""...a small cave which you will need to crawl through...""
*   **D: ሾጣጣዎቹ ክፍሎች እርጥብ ሲሆኑ አደገኛ ይሆናሉ** - The passage says: ""...particularly when wet it can become very dangerous."""

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states Majorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and olive oil, resembling Mediterranean cuisine. While bread *is* a key component, the passage doesn't mention grains in general as a foundational element of Majorcan food.  

* **ስጋ (Meat)** is mentioned as a core component.
* **ዳቦ (Bread)** is specifically highlighted as central to a popular dish.
* **አትክልቶች (Vegetables)** are also listed as a basis of the cuisine.
* **አህል (Grains)** are not mentioned in the description."
በንባቡ ላይ ባለው መረጃ ስለ ሃንጊ ምግቦች የትኛው መግለጫ ትክክል አይደለም?,"The correct answer is **A: Geothermal hangi ጉድጓዱን ለማሞቅ ትኩስ ድንጋዮችን ከእሳት ይጠቀማል**.

Here's why:

The passage states that geothermal hangi uses heat from *either* hot rocks heated by fire *or* heat emanating directly from the earth. It doesn't say it *always* uses rocks heated by fire. In fact, it implies it can be heated *without* fire in some places.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **B: ሙቅ ድንጋዮችን በመጠቀም Hangi በWellington ይገኛል:** The text mentions you can try hangi in Wellington.
*   **C: የተጠበሰ እራት ብዙውን ጊዜ የሚበስለው hangi በመጠቀም ነው:**  The text explicitly states ""Hangi is often used to cook a traditional roast meal.""
*   **D: ጂኦተርማል hangi በ Rotorua ውስጥ ይገኛል:** The text specifically mentions that several places in Rotorua offer geothermal hangi.

"
ከሚከተሉት የ hangi ጉድጓድ ለማሞቅ የተለመደ መንገድ ያልተጠቀሰው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: Gas**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states Hangi pits are heated by:

*   **Hot stones** (""warmed by hot stones from a fire"")
*   **Geothermal heat** (""heat rising from the earth"")

It does *not* mention gas being used to heat the hangi pit.

Therefore, **gas** is the method *not* described in the passage. Note that option D is a duplicate of option B, but that doesn't affect the correct answer."
ከአንድ መነኩሴ ወይም መነኩሴ ልዩ እውቅና ምን ሊያስከትል ይችላል?,"The correct answer is **A: በደማቅ የተሸፈነ መጠቅለያ ለብሶ**.

Here's why:

The text states that bringing your own brightly colored garments can earn you a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance. This implies a special acknowledgement or recognition. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ትከሻዎትን መሸፈን** - This is a requirement, not something that earns special recognition.
* **C: ከገዳሙ መጠቅለያ መበደር** - The text doesn't mention any recognition for using the provided garments.
* **D: ከጉልበት በላይ የተቆረጠ ቀሚስ ለብሶ** - The text implies discomfort with the provided garments, not special acknowledgement.



"
ከገዳም ለመበደር ከሚከተሉት የልብስ ዕቃዎች መካከል የትኛው ነው? ,"The correct answer is **C: ሱሪዎች**.

The text explicitly states: ""በተመሳሳይ መንገድ ወንዶችም ጉልበቶቻቸውን የሚሸፍኑ ሱሪዎችን እንዲለብሱ ይጠበቅባቸዋል።"" (Similarly, men are expected to wear sarongs that cover their torsos.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ጉርዶች** - These are socks. The text doesn't mention socks.
*   **B: ቡታንታዎች** - This is not a standard garment and is not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: ጥምጣሞች** - These are trousers/pants. The text specifies *sarongs* for men.



"
አንታርክቲክ አካባቢዎችን ሲጎበኝ ጎብኚ ኮከቦችን ለማየት ብዙ እድሎች የሚኖረው መቼ ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: በክረምት ወራት**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states that you'll experience polar nights (where the sun doesn't rise) in the Arctic or Antarctic *during winter*. This darkness provides a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis *and* enjoy stargazing because of the lack of light pollution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በበጋ ወራት** - The passage states the opposite – winter is the best time for these views.
*   **B: አካባቢው ያን ያህል ሰው በማይሞላበት ጊዜ** - While true that low population helps with light pollution, the passage emphasizes the *winter darkness* as the key factor.
*   **D: የብርሃን ብክለት ደረጃ ዝቅተኛ በሚሆንበት ጊዜ** -  Again, while this is a contributing factor, the main point is the darkness of the polar night in winter.

የሳተላይት ስልክ ለሞባይል ስልክ ተስማሚ ምትክ የማይሆነው መቼ ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ወደ ሳተላይት ያለው የእይታ መስመር ሊደናቀፍ ይችላል**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that satellite phones require a clear line of sight to the satellite. If that line of sight is obstructed, the phone won't work. This makes it an unreliable replacement for a mobile phone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ቦታው በጣም ሩቅ ከሆነ** - The passage *states* satellite phones are useful in remote areas, so distance isn't the problem.
* **C: ከቤት ውጭ ጥቅም ላይ የሚውል ከሆነ** - Satellite phones *need* to be used outdoors with a clear view, so this isn't a limitation of them being a bad replacement.
* **D: አንድ ጉዞ የተወሰኑ የውሂብ ፍላጎቶችን የሚፈልግ ከሆነ** - The passage says satellite phones *can* handle data needs, so this isn't why they aren't a good replacement.



"
የሳተላይት ስልክ ከሞባይል ስልክ የተሻለ የሚሆነው መቼ ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: በጀልባ ጉዞ ወቅት (During a boat trip)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states satellite phones are useful in remote areas *outside of cellular coverage*. A boat trip, especially offshore, often takes you far from cell towers.
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **A: በከተማ ውስጥ በእረፍት ጊዜ (In a city on vacation)** - Cities generally *have* cellular coverage.
    * **C: የርቀት ውሂብ አስፈላጊ በማይሆንበት ጊዜ (When remote data isn't needed)** - Satellite phones are specifically useful *for* remote data and voice needs.
    * **D: በቂ የሞባይል ስልክ ሽፋን ሊኖርዎት በሚችልበት ጊዜ (When you can have adequate mobile phone coverage)** - If you have good mobile coverage, a satellite phone isn't better, it's redundant.

ከሚከተሉት የትኛው ግጭት ወደ ትራንስኒስትሪያ ሪፐብሊክ መፈጠር ምክንያት ሆኗል?,"The correct answer is **B: ብሄር**.

The text explicitly states: ""ሞልዶቫ በብሄር ግጭት የተሰቃየች ባለብዙ ብሄር ሪፐብሊክ ናት።"" This conflict led to the creation of Transnistria.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኢኮኖሚ** - While economic ties were *re-established* later, the text doesn't say economic issues *caused* the conflict.
*   **C: ቋንቋ** - Language is mentioned as a characteristic of Moldova (Romanian and Russian are spoken), but not as the cause of the conflict.
*   **D: እምነት** - Religion (Orthodox Christianity) is mentioned, but not as a source of conflict."
ከቀሪዎቹ ሞልዶቫ የሚለየው ትራንስኒስትሪያ ሪፐብሊክ ያለው የትኛው ነው?  ,"The correct answer is **C: የተባበሩት መንግስታት እውቅና**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Transnistria ""has its own government and currency but has not gained recognition from any UN member state."" This is the key difference between Transnistria and the rest of Moldova.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ቋንቋ** - The text states Romanian is the official language of Moldova and Russian is widely used. It doesn't say Transnistria has a different official language.
*   **B: እምነት** - The text states Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova, and doesn’t mention a different primary religion in Transnistria.
*   **D: ገንዘብ** - The text says Transnistria has *its own* currency, but doesn’t state Moldova doesn't have currency.

በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ተጓዥ ነፋሻማ ሁኔታዎችን ለማስወገድ ተስፋ ካደረገ ሞንቴቪዲዮን መቼ መጎብኘት አለበት?,"The correct answer is **C: በሰሜናዊው ንፍቀ ክበብ የበጋ ወራት**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""በሰሜናዊ ንፍቀ ክበብ ክረምት ሲሆን በዚያው በጋ እና በተቃራኒው ደግሞ ክረምት ነው።"" This means Montevideo experiences summer when the Northern Hemisphere experiences winter.
* **The question asks:** When should someone visit Montevideo to *avoid* windy conditions.
* **The passage also states:** ""ክረምቱ በአወዛጋቢ ሁኔታ ቀዝቃዛ ሊሆን ይችላል፥ የሙቀት መጠኑ ውሃ በረዶ ከሚሆንበት ደረጃ አንዳንድ ጊዜ ነው ዝቅ የሚለው፣ ነገር ግን ነፋሱ እና እርጥበቱ ተቀላቅሎ የሙቀት መለኪያው ከሚለው ይልቅ ቀዝቃዛ እንደሆነ ያስመስለዋል።""  This clearly links windy conditions to the winter months.

Therefore, visiting when the Northern Hemisphere is in summer (and Montevideo is in winter) would be the best time to avoid the windy conditions described.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Montevideo experiences +30°C temperatures during the summer months.
* The question asks when a traveler who prefers warmer weather should visit.
* Therefore, visiting during the summer in Montevideo would be the most suitable time for someone who dislikes cold weather.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: በሰሜናዊው ንፍቀ ክበብ በበጋ ወቅት:** This would be Montevideo's winter, which is described as cold.
* **C: የሞንቴቪዲዮ የዝናብ ወቅት በሚሆንበት ጊዜ:** The passage states that rain is consistent throughout the year, so this doesn't guarantee warmer weather.
* **D: በሰሜናዊው ንፍቀ ክበብ ክረምት ሲሆን:** This corresponds to summer in Montevideo, but the question asks for a time suitable for someone who dislikes cold."

Here's why:

* **The passage contrasts organized graffiti artists with vandalism.** Vandalism is described as unwanted markings like scribbles or tags defacing property. Organized graffiti artists, on the other hand, create artwork.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Graffiti acts:** This is too general. The passage discusses a *type* of graffiti act – the artistic kind, versus the vandalistic kind.
* **C: Unwanted wall markings on public property:** This *defines* vandalism, the opposite of what the question is asking for.
* **D: Unreadable markings:** While some vandalism might be unreadable, it doesn't specifically highlight the contrast with the art created by organized graffiti artists.

አንዳንድ አስተናጋጆች የልምዱ ወሳኝ አካል አድርገው የሚቆጥሩት የትኛው የሙዚቃ ፌስቲቫሎች ገጽታ ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: ውጪ ላይ መሆን**.

Here's why:

The passage states that many festival attendees choose to stay at the festival grounds to rest, and find this a valuable part of the experience. This implies that *being* at the festival, experiencing the atmosphere and being outdoors, is considered important by some organizers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ህጻናትን ያምጡ** - While some festivals have areas for families, the passage doesn't suggest this is a central aspect valued by organizers.
*   **C: ማታ ሙዚቃ ማጨወት** - The passage mentions late-night music, but doesn't portray it as a crucial aspect valued by organizers.
*   **D: ቀድሞ መድረስ** - This is practical advice for attendees, not a feature organizers prioritize.



"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ የፌስቲቫሉ አስተናጋጅ ከሙዚቃው አጠገብ ካምፕ ማድረግ ከፈለገ ምን ቅድሚያ መስጠት አለበት?,"The correct answer is **D: ቀድሞ መድረስ** (Arrive early).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""If you want to be close to the music, you’ll need to arrive early to secure a spot near the music."" This directly answers the question about what someone who wants to camp near the music should prioritize.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ማታ ምሄድ** (Staying up late) - The passage mentions music continuing in other areas late into the night, but doesn't link this to *getting* a spot near the music.
*   **B: ለቤተሰብ በቦታው ላይ መቆየት** (Family camping) - This is a separate option for families with small children, not relevant to someone wanting to be near the main music stages.
*   **C: ከቦታው ውጪ መቀመጥ** (Camping outside the venue) - The passage doesn't suggest this is a good option for those wanting to be close to the music."
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ በሰሜናዊ New Mexico ጎብኚዎች የምሽት ህይወት ሲፈልጉ ከየት መራቅ አለባቸው?,"The correct answer is **B: የትንንሽ ከተማ ባሮች**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Beware: the small towns' bars here are not always good places for out-of-state visitors to hang out."" This directly indicates that visitors seeking nightlife should be wary of bars in small towns.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pueblos** - The passage doesn't mention anything negative about Pueblos.
*   **C: ሞሎች** - The passage doesn't mention malls at all.
*   **D: ሱቆች** - The passage mentions grocery stores in relation to drunk driving, but doesn't suggest visitors should avoid them for nightlife.



"
በንባቡ መሠረት፣ አንድ ጎብኚ New Mexico ውስጥ ታዋቂ መዝናኛዎችን የሚያገኝበት ዕድል የት አለ?,"The correct answer is **C: በከሲኖ Sante Fe አቅራቢያ**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that ""certain casinos...bring in name entertainment (mainly the larger ones near Albuquerque and Santa Fe)."" This implies that casinos near Santa Fe are where you're most likely to find popular entertainment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ከAlbuquerque ሁለት ሰዓት በቁማር** - The text doesn't guarantee entertainment at casinos two hours from Albuquerque.
*   **B: ራቅ በለ pueblo** - The text doesn't mention entertainment in remote pueblos.
*   **D: በትንንሽ የከተማ ባሮች** - The text explicitly warns that bars in small towns aren't always good for tourists.

የበጀት ግንዛቤ ያላቸው ተጓዦች ከየትኛው ዓይነት መጠጥ መራቅ ይፈልጋሉ?,"The correct answer is **D: የአከባቢ ጭማቂ (Local juice)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""የፍራፍሬ ጭማቂዎች ውድ ቢሆኑም ግን በጣም ጥሩ ናቸው"" (Fruit juices are expensive, but very good).  This clearly indicates that fruit juices are *expensive*, making them a less desirable option for budget-conscious travelers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የአውስትራሊያ ዋይን (Australian wine)** - The passage suggests New Zealand and Australian wines are *good* options.
*   **B: የተሸገ ዉሃ (Bottled water)** - It says bottled water is *easily available* if you're worried about the tap water.
*   **C: የአከባቢ ቢራ (Local beer)** - The passage describes the local beer as enjoyable and sufficient, not expensive.



"
በንባቡ መሰረት፣ ቦታ ላይ በመመስረት ከሚከተሉት የመጠጥ ትዕዛዞች ውስጥ በአገልጋዩ ግራ ሊጋባ የሚችለው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: ጠፍጣፋ ነጭ (Flat White)**.

Here's why:

* The text specifically states that the concept of a 'Flat White' coffee is *very different* to Australians. This implies it's not a standard drink known or easily understood in the location being described, and the server might be confused by the order.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to cause confusion:

* **A: አጭር ጥቁር (Short Black/Espresso):** The text *explains* what this is - an espresso. The server understands it.
* **B: ቁጥር አንድ (Number One):** This is identified as the main local beer. The server will know this.
* **C: Sauvignon Blanc ከ New Zealand:** The text says New Zealand wines ""can travel well"" and are a good option, implying they are available and understood.

ለሦስት መቶ ዓመታት የዘለቀ የቅኝ ግዛት ዘመን የጀመረው በየትኛው ቡድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: The Spaniards**.

The passage states: ""Spaniards initiated a three-hundred-year colonial period."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: The Payaguá** - The passage mentions the Payaguá as an indigenous group alongside the Guaycurú, surviving by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
* **B: The Guaycurú** - Similar to the Payaguá, the Guaycurú are identified as an indigenous group.
* **C: The Guaraní** - The Guaraní are described as the most important indigenous group *before* Spanish colonization.

በንባቡ መሠረት፣ አንድ ፓሪስ ከእርስዎ ጋር እንዲሞቅ ለማድረግ ከሁሉ የተሻለው መንገድ ምንድነው?,"The correct answer is **B: በራስ መተማመንን ያውጡ (Show self-assurance)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that to get along with Parisians, you should act as though you are ""bien élevé"" (well-bred) which means acting with your best manners. It also mentions that showing basic politeness will quickly soften their initially aloof exterior. This implies projecting confidence and good manners – in other words, self-assurance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የፔርሺያን አመለካከት ለመኮረጅ ይሞክሩ (Try to copy the Parisian attitude)**: The passage specifically calls the Parisian attitude ""largely a mistaken impression"" and suggests *not* adopting it.
*   **C: ይረጋጉ (Be calm)**: While calmness is good, the passage doesn’t directly say this is the key to getting along with Parisians.
*   **D: ያልተረጋጋ ብህሪ ያሳዩ (Show erratic behavior)**: This would likely have the opposite effect, as the passage suggests politeness is needed to break through their initial reserve.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states Parisians are perceived as ""selfish, arrogant, and snobbish."" It then says these are largely inaccurate perceptions. While the passage mentions snobbery (which could be *related* to a sort of affectation/duplicity), it doesn't list it as one of the core stereotypes.

*   **A: እብሪተኝነት (Snobbishness)** - Directly mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: ተጨዋችነት (Playfulness)** -  The passage implies that showing basic politeness can disarm their ""sudden exterior behavior,"" hinting they *aren't* always playful.
*   **D: መረበሽ (Arrogance)** - Directly mentioned in the passage.

""ዱሪየነት"" (duplicity - deceitfulness) is not listed as one of the core stereotypes. Therefore, it's the answer that doesn't fit."
በCape Town MetroRail ላይ የአንደኛ ክፍል ጥቅማጥቅሞች ምንድን ናቸው?,"The correct answer is **A: አሰልጣኙ በባቡሩ ፊት ለፊት ነው** and **B: እንደ ብዙ ሰዎች አይደለም**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""MetroPlus ተሳቢዎቹ ሁሌም ለኬፕ ታውን ቅርቡ የባቡር ጫፍ ላይ ናቸው"" (MetroPlus compartments are always at the end of the train closest to Cape Town) and ""ሜትሮፕላስ በጣም ምቾት ያለውና በብዛት ያልተጨናነቀ"" (MetroPlus is more comfortable and less crowded).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **C: ከሶስተኛ ክፍል ትኬት ያነሰ ውድ ነው (It's cheaper than a third-class ticket):** The passage says MetroPlus is *more* expensive than other regular Metro tickets (third class).
*   **D: ከሜትሮ ቲኬት ጋር ተመሳሳይ ዋጋ ነው (It has the same price as a Metro ticket):**  The passage states MetroPlus is slightly more expensive.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Each train has both MetroPlus and Metro carriages.""  MetroPlus is described as the first class (ሜትሮፕላስ (የመጀመሪያ ክፍል ተብሎም ይጠራል)) and Metro as the third class (ሦስተኛው ክፍል).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ብዙም ያልተጨናነቀ የሜትሮ አሰልጣኝ (Less crowded Metro carriage):** While MetroPlus *is* less crowded, the question asks what *every* train has, not just a characteristic of one part of the train.
* **B: ለሁለቱም ክፍሎች ተመሳሳይ የቲኬት ዋጋ (The same ticket price for both classes):** The text specifically says MetroPlus is more expensive.
* **C: ሶስት የተለያዩ ክፍሎች (Three different classes):** The text only mentions two classes, MetroPlus and Metro.

ከሚከተሉት የእንስሳት ተባዮች የማይሰራው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: ኃይለኛ ጉዳቶችን ያመጣሉ።**

Let's look at why the other options *are* things parasites do:

* **A: ሽፍታ ፍጠር (Cause itching):** The passage says parasites can cause irritation.
* **B: አለርጂዎችን ያስቆጣ (Trigger allergies):** The passage explicitly states parasites can cause allergic reactions.
* **C: ኢንፌክሽንን ያሰራጩ (Spread infection):** The passage states parasites can transmit pathogens.

Therefore, causing *serious harm* is something the passage specifically distinguishes parasites *from*."
የቅድመ ክፍያ የስልክ ካርዶች የት መግዛት ይቻላል?,"The correct answer is **C: የማዕዘን ሱቆች ውስጥ**.

The passage explicitly states: ""እያንዳንዱ የማዕዘን ሱቅ በክፍያ ስልኮች ወይም በተለመዱት ስልኮች ጥቅም ላይ ሊውሉ በሚችሉት ግራ በሚያጋቡ የቅድሚያ ክፍያ የስልክ ካርዶች እቃዎች የተሞላ ነው።"" (Every convenience store is stocked with confusing prepaid phone cards that can be used in payphones or regular phones.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: በተወሰኑ አገሮች ውስጥ** - The passage doesn't mention where the cards are available geographically.
* **B: በባቡር ጣቢያዎች** - The passage doesn't mention train stations.
* **D: በክፍያ ስልኮች** - The cards are *used* in payphones, but you don't *buy* them from payphones.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...አንዳንዶቹ ለተወሰኑ የሀገር ስብስቦች የሚመች የመደወያ ዋጋ ማቅረብ ላይ የተለየ ትኩረት ይሰጣሉ።"" (Some cards offer a specific focus on offering favorable call rates for certain groups of countries).  This directly implies the better call rates are tied to calling specific countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: በነጻ የስልክ ቁጥሮች (Through toll-free numbers):** The passage says toll-free numbers *access* the service, but they don't *create* the better rates.
* **C: በማዕዘን መደብር (At a convenience store):** Convenience stores *sell* the cards, but don't influence the rates themselves.
* **D: የክፍያ ስልክ በመጠቀም እና ተጨማሪ ክፍያ በመክፈል (Using a payphone and paying extra):** The passage refers to *prepaid* cards, not payphones.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the park is heavily forested with **beech, spruce, and fir**. It *doesn't* mention oak trees. Therefore, oak is the least common of the options listed in relation to the park's description."

በንባቡ መሠረት የክልል ኮዶች ምን ይረዳሉ?,"The correct answer is **B: የገበያ ቁጥጥር (Market control)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""The real purpose is to allow those companies to have more control over their markets... it's all about money flow.""  The author argues that regional codes aren't about stopping piracy (discs still play on any device), but about controlling *where* products are sold and therefore controlling the market.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ድስክ ኮፒንግ (Disc copying):** The passage directly contradicts this, saying regional codes have *no* impact on illegal copying.
* **C: የባህር ላይ ወንበዴዎች መከላከል (Preventing piracy):**  The passage states this is the *stated* reason, but the author argues it's a false justification.
* **D: ህገወጥ መቅዳት (Illegal copying):** Similar to C, the passage says regional codes don't actually prevent this.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""የክልል ኮዶች በሕገ-ወጥ ቅጅ ላይ ፈጽሞ ምንም ተጽዕኖ የላቸውም"" (Regional codes have absolutely no impact on illegal copying). It then goes on to say the stated reason (""ውንብድናን ለመከላከል ነው"") is a cover for gaining more market control.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ተጨማሪ የገበያ ቁጥጥር ለማግኘት አስፈላጊ ናቸው:** While the passage says this is the *actual* reason, it's not what the companies *claim* it is. The question asks about the stated reason.
* **B: ሕገ-ወጥ ቅጂን ለማስወገድ ይረዳሉ:** The passage directly contradicts this.
* **C: ለገንዘብ ሽክርክሪት ጠቃሚ ናቸው:** The passage mentions money flow (""ስለ ገንዘብ ዝውውር"") but doesn't say the codes themselves are valuable for money laundering.

ወደ ትውልድ አገርዎ ሲደርሱ፣ የትኛው ሂደት መደበኛ ያልሆነ ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: የኢሚግሬሽን ፍተሻዎች**.

Here's why:

The prompt states that immigration checks are often cursory (""just for show"") while customs control can be difficult. This means the immigration process is the one that's frequently *not* thorough or strict - therefore, it's the process that's often performed in a non-rigorous way.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ንጥሎችን ማወጅ (Declaring items):** You are *required* to declare items, and the prompt highlights the importance of doing so legally. This is not a process that would be non-rigorous.
* **C: የእቃዎች ህጋዊ ገደቦች (Legal limits of goods):**  These are fixed rules; the process of enforcing them isn't described as being casual.
* **D: የጉምሩክ ቁጥጥር (Customs control):** The prompt specifically says customs control *is* likely to be difficult, meaning it is a strict and thorough process, not a non-rigorous one.



"

Here's why:

The prompt emphasizes knowing what you *can* and *cannot* bring, and declaring anything exceeding legal limits. This directly relates to understanding if the items you possess are allowed into the country. 

Let's look at why the other options are less complete:

*   **A: የኢሚግሬሽን ፍተሻ ካለ (If there is an immigration check)** - Knowing if there's an immigration check is important, but doesn't tell you about *what you can bring*.
*   **B: እቃዎችን ከህጋዊ ገደቦች በላይ ማወጅ ከፈለጉ (If you want to declare items exceeding legal limits)** - This is about *what to do if* you have too much, not about knowing what's permissible in the first place.
*   **C: የጉምሩክ ቁጥጥር ካለ (If there is a customs check)** - Similar to A, knowing about the check itself isn't enough; you need to know the rules.

The core message of the prompt is being aware of restrictions on *items*, making **D** the most accurate answer.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Countless walls... are being created with new routes by climbers from all over the world.""  This directly links the abundance of walls to the continual discovery of new climbing routes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ስብሰባዎች (Meetings)** - Meetings don't create climbing routes.
* **C: ክፍተኛ (Openings)** - While openings *within* walls are important for climbing, the walls themselves are the fundamental feature.
* **D: ግርግዳ (Granite)** - Granite is the *material* the walls are made of, not the feature enabling new routes.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Star Alliance covers everything from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, except the eastern South Pacific..."". This indicates Star Alliance has the most extensive coverage within the Southern Hemisphere routes discussed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: SkyTeam:** The passage explicitly states SkyTeam doesn't cover any transoceanic routes.
*   **C: South Pacific:** This is a *region*, not an airline alliance.
*   **D: LATAM Oneworld:** While mentioned, the text says it's not the *only* option, and doesn't state it covers the most area. It's specifically noted as a route *within* Star Alliance's coverage.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Star Alliance covers everything from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, except for the Eastern South Pacific..."". This means Star Alliance covers a significant portion of the South Pacific routes, more than the other alliances mentioned. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: South Pacific:** This isn't an airline alliance mentioned in the text.
*   **C: LATAM Oneworld:** The text specifically mentions LATAM Oneworld as *a* flight option, but doesn't state it's the one covering the most South Pacific routes.
*   **D: SkyTeam:** The text explicitly states SkyTeam doesn't cover *any* transoceanic routes in the Southern Hemisphere.

ግሎባል ሩጫ ጉብኝቶችን የተሳካለት የትኛው አስጎብኝ ድርጅት ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: Go Running Tours**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Global Running Tours partnered with dozens of tour running providers across four continents...started in Barcelona with Running Tours Barcelona and Copenhagen with Running Tours Copenhagen, and quickly followed by Running Tours Prague and others."" 

This indicates that **Global Running Tours** is the overarching organization *partnering* with the local tour companies like ""Running Tours Barcelona"" and ""Running Tours Copenhagen."" It's Global Running Tours that has the broad international reach and is the successful entity described.

The other options are simply *local* tour operators that Global Running Tours has partnered with."

The text states: ""ዓለም አቀፍ ሩጫ ጉብኝቶች በአራት አህጉራት በደርዘን የሚቆጠሩ የጉብኝት ሩጫ አቅራቢዎች ጋር ግንኙነት አላቸው።"" (""Go Running Tours has affiliations with dozens of tour running providers across four continents."") 

Therefore, Go Running Tours helps connect with **dozens** of different tour organizations."

The passage states: ""አንበሶች፣ አቦ ሸማኔዎች እና ነብሮች አንዳንድ ጊዜ አይናፋር ናቸው እና በአጉሉ መነጽር የተሻለ ያዩአቸዋል።"". This directly translates to ""Lions, baboons, and leopards are sometimes elusive and are better viewed with binoculars.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በእግር ጉዞ ሳፋሪ ይሂዱ (Go on a walking safari)** - While a walking safari is mentioned, the text doesn't specifically say it's the *best* way to see baboons.
*   **B: በጫካ የእግር ጉዞ ይሂዱ (Go on a forest walk)** - The passage focuses on safaris in the savanna, not forest walks.
*   **D: መኪና ይውሰዱ እና መደበኛ መሳሪያዎችን ይጠቀሙ (Take a car and use regular equipment)** - The passage states that regular equipment is good for animals that approach vehicles, but baboons are described as sometimes elusive and needing binoculars.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: አንበሶች** - The text says lions are ""sometimes elusive"" and require binoculars for a better view.
*   **C: ነብሮች** - The text also says hyenas are ""sometimes elusive"" and require binoculars.
*   **D: አቦሸማኔዎች** - The text similarly states that bushbucks are ""sometimes elusive"" and binoculars are recommended.

Here's why:

The passage states ""...በነብስ ወከፍ የተሻለ ተመን ለማግኘት ይችላሉ"" when forming a group of six or four people. This means larger groups get a better price.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በራስዎ ይህዱ** - The passage suggests it's *more* expensive to go alone.
*   **B: የአራት ቡድን ማግኘት** - While a group of four gets a better price, six or more is *better*.
*   **C: ከአንድ ሌላ ሰው ጋር መሄድ** - This is a good idea for meeting people but doesn't guarantee a lower price specifically.

ምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ምርጡን የጉብኝት መጠን ማን ሊያረጋግጥ ይችላል?,"The passage suggests that the best price is achieved with groups of four or six. While it doesn't state a *single* best number, it implies larger groups get better deals. Of the options provided:

* **D: የአምስት ቡድን (A group of five)** is the closest to the ideal group size mentioned (four or six).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ቱሪስቶች መኪናዎችን ለመቀላቀል ፈቃደኛ ናቸው (Tourists are willing to join cars)** - This is a *possibility* mentioned, but doesn't represent a best group size.
* **B: የሶስት ቡድን (A group of three)** - Too small to get the better rate.
* **C: ሁለት ጓደኛሞች አብረው የሚጓዙ (Two friends traveling together)** - Also too small.

Therefore, the answer is **D**.

ምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ለሳን ፍራንሲስኮ በዓለም አቀፍ ደረጃ እውቅና እንዲሰጥ ያደረገው ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: በተለያዩ የኪነጥበብ እና የመገናኛ ዘዴዎች ውስጥ በተደጋጋሚ መገኘት**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""በሙዝቃ፣ በፊልም፣ በስነፅሁፍ እና በብዙሐን ባህል ላይ በተደጋጋሚ መቅረቧ፣ ከተማዋንና የከተማዋን ምርጥ ገፅታዎች በአለም ላይ ታዋቂ እንዲሆን ረድቷታል።"" This directly links San Francisco's international recognition to its frequent portrayal in various art forms and media.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ከፍተኛ ደረጃ ያላቸው የስብሰባ መገልገያዎች:** While the text mentions high-quality facilities, it doesn't say this is *what* made San Francisco famous.
* **C: የኢኮኖሚ ልዩነት:** The text notes the diversified economy, but doesn't say this is the main reason for global recognition.
* **D: እየመጣ ያለ የእስያ ምግብ ትዕይንት:**  The text highlights the excellent Asian cuisine but frames it as a *feature* of San Francisco, not the reason it's globally known.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that while San Francisco's economy is *associated* with tourism, it's diversified and relies on multiple sectors like professional services, government jobs, financial institutions, and commerce. It is **not** solely based on tourism.

Let's look at why the other options are true:

*   **A: ብዙ ጊዜ በፊልሞች እና መጽሐፍት ውስጥ ቀርቧል** - The passage mentions San Francisco is frequently featured in movies, film, literature, and popular culture.
*   **B: የእስያ ምግቦች በብዛት ይገኛሉ** - The passage specifically says San Francisco is a prime location for various Asian cuisines (Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese).
*   **C: ብዙ ሆቴሎች እና የስብሰባ ማዕከላት አሉ** - The passage states that San Francisco has a large tourist infrastructure including many hotels and high-end facilities."
በንባቡ መሰረት፣ የጉዞ ወኪል አገልግሎቶችን ለመጠቀም የማይጠቅመው የትኛው ዓይነት ተጓዥ ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ቆራጥ ያልሆነ ተጓዥ (Inflexible traveler)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Also, if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents (e.g., visa) for your destination, they can hold the place for you. However, any modifications or requests must be made to the travel agent, *not* directly to the hotel.""

This highlights that using a travel agent requires some flexibility, as changes must go through them. A traveler who is inflexible and wants direct control over their booking and modifications would find this system frustrating.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ለድንገተኛነት የተጋለጠ መንገደኛ (Traveler prone to emergencies):**  Travel agents can help with transportation and arrangements, which could be beneficial in emergencies.
*   **C: ቪዛውን ገና ያላረጋገጠ መንገደኛ (Traveler whose visa is not yet confirmed):** The passage specifically mentions agents can *hold the place* while you obtain documents like a visa.
*   **D: ጥቅል ስምምነቶችን ማስያዝ የሚመርጥ ተጓዥ (Traveler who prefers package deals):** Travel agents frequently *offer* package deals (flight + hotel, etc.).



"
ከሚከተሉት በንባቡ በተጓዥ ወኪል በኩል ማስያዝ ጥቅም ተብሎ ያልተጠቀሰው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ፈጣን የጉዞ ሰነዶች (Fast travel documents)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states travel agents can help you *obtain* documents like visas if you're short on time.** However, it doesn't mention they provide *fast* travel documents. It just says they can handle the process for you.
*   **B: ሆቴል መያዝ (Hotel Booking)** - The passage explicitly states travel agents often have deals with hotels and can book rooms for you.
*   **C: ሁሉን ያካተተ ፓኬጆች (All-inclusive packages)** - The passage mentions travel agents frequently offer packages including meals and airport transfers.
*   **D: ቦታ ማስያዝ (Reservation)** - The passage states that travel agents can reserve places for travelers.

Therefore, getting *fast* travel documents is not a stated benefit of using a travel agent in this text."
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ የእውነተኛ ጊዜ የጽሑፍ ተርጓሚ መተግበሪያዎች ምን ማድረግ አይችሉም?,"The correct answer is **D: 100% በትክክል መተርጎም**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that while translation engines have improved, they *still* can make mistakes (""...and sometimes give gibberish"") and cautions users to ""exercise some caution"" because errors are possible.  This means they cannot guarantee 100% accuracy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ምልክቶችን በውጭ ቋንቋዎች መተርጎም** - The passage *specifically* states these apps can translate text on signs in foreign languages.
*   **B: ሙሉውን የጽሑፍ ክፍሎችን መተርጎም** - The passage describes these apps as capable of translating entire sections of text.
*   **C: በስማርትፎን በኩል በእቃዎች ላይ ጽሑፍን መተርጎም** - The passage mentions the ability to point your phone at objects to translate text on them.

ትርጉሞች ከመስመር ውጭ እንዲደረጉ ምን ይፈቅዳል?,"The correct answer is **C: የቋንቋ ውሂብ በማውረድ ላይ**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Google Translate (and presumably other apps in this category) can work offline *after* downloading the desired language data.  The other options are incorrect:

* **A: የተሻሻሉ የትርጉም ሞተሮች** - While improved engines make translation *better*, they don't enable offline use.
* **B: ስማርት ስልኮች** - Smartphones are the *device* used, but not what enables offline translation.
* **D: በእውነተኛ ጊዜ የትርጉም ምድብ ውስጥ ያሉ መተግበሪያዎች** - This describes the *type* of app, not the method for offline use.



"
ከሚከተሉት ለበረዶ ውድቀት መንስኤ ያልሆነው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ተለጣፊ በረዶ**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ice is *prone* to sliding *because* it's cohesive (sticking together). It doesn't say cohesive ice *causes* avalanches. Instead, it explains how cohesion makes even a small trigger dangerous.

The passage explicitly mentions humans (people), the sun, and additional snow as potential triggers for avalanches.
"
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ እንደ ጥፋት የሚወርድ የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: በገደላማ ቁልቁል ላይ ከመጠን በላይ የበረዶ መጠን**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that avalanches occur when there's a build-up of snow/ice (""high mountains can hold a lot of snow, and excess snow comes down as avalanches"").** It also emphasizes that once started, an avalanche can trigger further snow/ice to come down.
* **Option C** directly describes this situation – excessive snow (ice) on a steep slope.  This is the perfect setup for an avalanche.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: የማይነቃነቅ ተለጣፊ በረዶ (Immobile, cohesive ice):** The passage *describes* ice as cohesive (sticking together), but this doesn't cause an avalanche. Avalanches need *movement*.
* **B: በረዶ የሌለበት ቁልቁል ተዳፋት (A steep slope with no ice):**  No ice, no avalanche.
* **D: ሰው ሳይነካው የቀረው በረዶ (Ice remaining untouched by humans):** The passage states avalanches can be triggered by humans, but also by natural causes.  Ice that hasn’t moved isn’t a hazard in itself.

በንባቡ መሰረት፣ ካሪ በየትኞቹ ንጥረ ነገሮች ላይ የተመሰረተ ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: ዕፅዋት እና ቅመሞች**.

The passage states: ""ከሪ ከስጋ ወይም አታክልት ጋር በእጽዋትና ቅመማ ቅመም ላይ የተመሰረተ ምግብ ነው።"" This translates to ""Curry is a dish based on meat or vegetables with **herbs and spices**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: እርጎ እና ውሃ** (Yogurt and water) - Yogurt is mentioned as being used in *some* curries, but it's not the base.
*   **C: የኮኮናት ወተት እና ስጋ** (Coconut milk and meat) - Coconut milk is used in *some* curries, but it's a regional variation, not the foundation of all curries.
*   **D: አትክልቶች እና ወተት** (Vegetables and milk) - While vegetables can be in curry, milk isn't mentioned as a base ingredient."
በተወሰኑ ክልሎች የኮኮናት ወተት አንዳንድ ጊዜ በኩሪ ውስጥ በየትኛው ንጥረ ነገር ምትክ ጥቅም ላይ ይውላል?,"The correct answer is **A: ስጋ**.

The passage states: ""በሰሜናዊ ሕንድ እና ፓኪስታን ባሉ የመሃል አገር አካባቢዎች እርጎ በተለምዶ በከሪዎች ውስጥ ጥቅም ላይ ይውላል፣ በደቡብ ህንድ እና በሌሎች በክፍለ አህጉሩ የባህር ዳርቻ አካባቢዎች የኮኮናት ወተት አብዛኛውን ጊዜ ጥቅም ላይ ይውላል።"" This directly translates to coconut milk often replacing meat in coastal regions of the Indian subcontinent."
ወደ ደጋማው ቦታ ለመድረስ በ Transantarctic ተራሮች ዙሪያ ጠመዝማዛ ለምን አስፈለገ?,"The correct answer is **C: ልዩ ትራክተሮች ደፋር አይደሉም**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""These are not very nimble, so the route to the plateau has to be a long winding one around the Transantarctic Mountains."" This directly explains that the reason for going around the mountains is because the specialized tractors aren't maneuverable enough to take a direct route over difficult terrain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: የMcMurdo ጣቢያ ብዙ ጊዜ ይዘጋል (McMurdo Station often closes)** - This isn't mentioned in the passage and doesn't explain the route taken.
* **B: የታመቀ በረዶ አደገኛ ነው (The compacted ice is dangerous)** - While the passage mentions the ice is compacted and marked, it doesn't say it *forces* the route around the mountains. It's a challenge the tractors can navigate (albeit slowly).
* **D: በሮዝ ባህር ከመጓዝ የበለጠ ቀላል ነው (It is easier than traveling over the Ross Sea)** - The passage doesn't compare the difficulty, it simply states the route *is* taken around the mountains.

በደቡብ ዋልታ መሄጃ መንገድ፣ ባንዲራ ያለበት ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: በበረዶ የተሞሉ ክሪቫሶች**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that the South Pole Traverse is ""strewn with compacted snow in crevasses and marked with flags."" This directly links the flags to the crevasses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በ McMurdo ጣቢያ ላይ ያለው መንገድ** - The passage states the traverse *starts* 1600km from McMurdo Station, it doesn't say the flags are *at* the station.
*   **B: ነዳጅ የሚጎትቱ ትራክተሮች** - The passage mentions specialized tractors are *used on* the traverse, but the flags aren't on the tractors.
*   **D: በተራሮች ዙሪያ አደገኛ ሽክርክሪቶች** - While the route goes around mountains, the flags mark the crevasses, not the mountain route itself.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states to *assume neighboring countries are NOT stable* when planning. This is the opposite of option C.
*   Options A, B, and D are all directly mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, the one thing the tourists should know that's *not* mentioned is the stability of the neighboring countries, but rather the passage warns against assuming they are stable."

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that **4x4 is highly recommended** and that many areas are **only accessible by high clearance 4x4 vehicles.** Saying most places are accessible by a regular car directly contradicts this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage *supports* this statement. It says you need to check what emergency equipment is required.
*   **C:** The passage *supports* this statement. It says driving is a great way to see beauty off the beaten path.
*   **D:** The passage *supports* this statement. It advises considering that neighboring countries might not be as stable as South Africa.

*   **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    *   **A: ሊሰረቁ ይችላሉ** - ""የተዘነጉ ቦርሳዎች ለስርቆት ኢላማ ሲሆኑ...""
    *   **B: ሳታውቅ የመድኃኒት ተሸካሚ ልትሆን ይችላሉ** - ""ራስዎን እንደ እጽ አስተላላፊ ሆነው ሊያገኙት ይችላሉ...""

*   **C: ከሌላ ሰው ጋር ግራ ሊጋቡ ይችላሉ** is not discussed in the text. The passage focuses on theft, drug smuggling, and security threats, but doesn't mention the possibility of simply confusing your bag with someone else's.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states the risks of carrying something for someone else, implying you could unknowingly be carrying drugs. It also warns about drug-sniffing dogs and severe penalties. However, it **doesn't** directly state that authorities will search or seize your bags *even if you haven't knowingly been involved with drugs*. It focuses on the *risk* of unknowingly carrying drugs, not a general right to search.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage *does* mention that some countries have the death penalty for first offenses.
*   **B:** The passage emphasizes the need for extra caution, especially when crossing international borders.
*   **C:** The passage *does* state that drug-sniffing dogs can be used at any time without warning.

Here's why:

The passage mentions making coffee, chamomile tea, juice, and smoothies. It specifically suggests trying ""random juice"" or ""a few chilled fruit purees"".  It doesn't mention beer at all.

* **A: ጭማቂ (Juice)** - Specifically mentioned.
* **B: ቡና (Coffee)** - Specifically mentioned.
* **D: ሻይ (Tea)** - Specifically mentioned.
* **C: ቢራ (Beer)** - Not mentioned in the context of making at home during downtime.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""If you live in a city with a distinct drinking culture, venture to bars or pubs in neighborhoods you don't frequent."" This directly aligns with option C.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: ከጎረቤትዎ ውጭ ያሉ ቡና ቤቶች** - While the passage mentions coffee, it's not the primary recommendation for exploring a city's drinking culture.
*   **B: ጭማቂ ወይም ለስላሳ ሱቆች** - The passage mentions juice as an occasional treat, not a core part of experiencing the city's culture.
*   **D: የካሞሜል ሻይ የሚያመርቱ ምግብ ቤቶች** - Chamomile tea is presented as a relaxing personal choice, not a cultural exploration activity.



"
የርግብ ቅርጻ ቅርጾች የት ይገኛሉ?,"The correct answer is **B: በቤተ ክርስቲያኑ ግቢ ውስጥ**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...in some graves in the churchyard are amazing puffin-shaped tombstones."" (""in some cemeteries in the churchyard there are amazing puffin-shaped tombstones."") 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ከመንደሩ ግማሽ ሰዓት** - This refers to the travel time *to* the village, not where the puffins are.
* **C: በ Eysturoy ደሴት ላይ** -  The village *views* Eysturoy, but the puffins aren't *on* the island.
* **D: በቤተ ክርስቲያን ውስጥ** - The passage says the graves (and thus the puffins) are in the *churchyard* (gቢ), which is outside the church building itself.

የትኛው የቪዛ አይነት በቂ የገንዘብ ድጋፍ ማረጋገጫ እንዲያቀርብ አንድ ሰው ሊያስፈልገው ይችላል?,"The correct answer is **D: የተማሪ ቪዛ**.

The passage specifically states: ""For most countries, you will need a letter of acceptance from the institution you plan to study at as well as proof of financial support sufficient to cover at least your first year of tuition."" This directly links the need for financial support proof to student visas.
"
የተራዘመ ቪዛ የሚያስፈልገው ማን ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ዓለም አቀፍ ተማሪ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that going to a country as an international student typically requires a longer stay than a tourist or business visit, and therefore necessitates a visa. It also details specific requirements for student visas (letter of acceptance, proof of funds). The passage focuses on the need for a visa for *extended* stays, which is characteristic of international students.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states "" በተለይም በበጋ ወቅት (Especially during the summer months)..."". It highlights summer as the time when you need to be particularly careful of ticks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: በግር ግዞ ላይ (While hiking)** - While the passage mentions walking in the forest, it doesn't single out hiking specifically.
* **C: በጫካ ውስጥ (In the forest)** - The forest is the location, but the *timing* (summer) is the key point.
* **D: ስነዱ (The document)** - This is irrelevant; the question asks about when to be careful of ticks, not the source of the information.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that even a ""few seconds"" with the door open is enough time for ticks to enter your vehicle.  This directly implies that leaving doors open for *long* periods increases the risk.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: በበጋው ወቅት መንዳት** (Driving in the summer) - While the passage mentions summer, it doesn't say to avoid driving then, just to be cautious of ticks.
* **C: በሞቃታማ አካባቢዎች መንዳት** (Driving in hot areas) - The passage mentions a ""partially scorching forest,"" but doesn't say to avoid these areas.
* **D: በእግር በሚጓዙበት ጊዜ ተሽከርካሪውን ያለ ክትትል መተው** (Leaving the vehicle unattended while walking) - The passage focuses on ticks entering the *car* when doors are open, not on leaving the car unattended.

* **B: የዱር አራዊት መቆያ** - While Sundarbans *is* a wildlife habitat, the text names the specific part within India as a National Park.
* **C: የዓለም ቅርስ ቦታ** - Sundarbans *is* a UNESCO World Heritage Site, but this doesn't name the specific section within India.
* **D: ጋንግቲክ ሜዳ** - The text says Sundarbans contains the *remnants* of the Gangetic forests, it's not the Gangetic plains itself.

This directly indicates that young people are more likely to have at least some understanding of English.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ቢያንስ ሁለት ሌሎች ቋንቋዎችን የሚናገሩ ሰዎች:** While multilingual people might be more likely to learn English, the passage doesn't specifically say this.
*   **C: ወደ ቶሮንቶ የሚጓዙ ሰዎች:**  The passage uses people in a Toronto restaurant as an example, but doesn't state *everyone* visiting Toronto knows English.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ቃላት በተለየ ዘዬ** - While the passage mentions different accents (Manitoban, Bostonian, etc.), it doesn't say *pronouncing words with different accents* is difficult, only that people *do* have different accents.
*   **C: የተጻፉ ቃላት** - The passage actually states the *opposite* - written words are *easier* to understand than spoken words.
*   **D: የአካባቢ argot** - The passage does mention local 'argot' (slang/dialect) as part of the stories shared, but doesn't state that it’s difficult to pronounce, only that it's part of their conversation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While buses *do* go to Bumthang, the passage doesn't mention needing to depart by 7:00.
* **C:** The passage mentions Paro as a place with shared taxis, but doesn't provide any information about specific departure times or needing to travel after 11.
* **D:** While buses go east, arriving *before* 6:20 doesn't guarantee a spot – the passage recommends booking in advance because they fill up.

ከዲስትሪክት አውቶቡስ ጣብያ ወደ ምስራቅ ለመጓዝ ለሚፈልግ ቱሪስት ምን ጥሩ ምክር ይሆናል?,"The correct answer is **B: የቅድሚያ ትኬት ይግዙ (Buy a ticket a little earlier)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""የወረዳ ውስጥ አውቶቡሶች በብዛት ሙሉ ስለሆኑ፣ ትንሽ ቀናት ቀደም ብሎ ትኬት መግዛት ይመከራል።"" (District buses are often full, so it is recommended to buy a ticket a little earlier).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: አውቶቡሶች የሚነሱት ከ8፡30 በኋላ ብቻ ነው (Buses only depart after 8:30)** - The passage says most buses to the east depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
* **C: ብዙ አውቶቡሶች ቀኑን ሙሉ ይሄዳሉ (Many buses go all day)** - While true, the passage emphasizes the buses fill up quickly, making advance booking more important than simply knowing they run all day.
* **D: የጋራ ታክሲ በጣም ብልጥ የጉዞ መንገድ ሊሆን ይችላል (Shared taxis can be a very smart way to travel)** - This is true *in general*, but the question specifically asks about travelling by district bus.

ከሚከተሉት የቲምቡክቱ ትክክለኛ መግለጫ ያልሆነው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: በአውሮፕላን የማይደረስ ነው (It is inaccessible by airplane)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Timbuktu *has* an airport: ""ቲምቡክቱ ምንም እንኳን ዝናዋ የቱሪስት መስህብ ቢያደርጋትም፣ እና አውሮፕላን ማረፊያ ቢኖራትም፣ ድሃ ከተማ ናት።"" (Timbuktu, although a famous tourist attraction and *having an airport*, is a poor city.)

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

* **A: ከሌላው የአገሪቱ ክፍል የበለጠ የአረብ ተጽእኖ አለው (Has more Arab influence than other parts of the country):** The passage says, ""ከአፍሪካነት የበለጠ የአረብ ገጽታ ስላላት፣ ከተማዋ ከሌሎቹ የአገሪቱ ከተሞች ጋር ፍጹም ተቃራኒ ናት።"" (Because it has a more Arab appearance than Africanness, the city is completely opposite to the other cities in the country.)
* **B: በድህነት የተጠቃ ነው (Is afflicted by poverty):** The passage states, ""ዛሬም፣ ቲምቡክቱ ምንም እንኳን ዝናዋ የቱሪስት መስህብ ቢያደርጋትም፣ እና አውሮፕላን ማረፊያ ቢኖራትም፣ ድሃ ከተማ ናት።"" (Even today, Timbuktu, although a famous tourist attraction and having an airport, is a poor city.)
* **D: ጉጉ ለሆኑ ቱሪስቶች መስህብ ሆኖ ቆይቷል (Has been a lure for eager tourists):** The passage says, ""ቲምቡክቱ ምንም እንኳን ዝናዋ የቱሪስት መስህብ ቢያደርጋትም..."" (Timbuktu, although a famous tourist attraction...)



"
ስለ ቲምቡክቱ ከሚከተሉት እውነታዎች ውስጥ የትኛው እውነት ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ከተማው በአውሮፕላን ተደራሽ ነው** (The city is accessible by airplane).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ዛሬም፣ ቲምቡክቱ ምንም እንኳን ዝናዋ የቱሪስት መስህብ ቢያደርጋትም፣ እና አውሮፕላን ማረፊያ ቢኖራትም፣ ድሃ ከተማ ናት።"" (Today, Timbuktu, despite its fame as a tourist attraction and having an airport, is a poor city.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ከድህነት የበለጠ እንግዳ ነው** (It is more strange than poor) - The passage states it *is* poor, but doesn't suggest it's more strange.
* **C: ከአካባቢው ከተሞች ያነሰ የአፍሪካ ቅልጥፍና አለው** (It has less African character than surrounding cities) - The passage states it has *more* of an Arabic appearance, making it different, not less African.
* **D: ከተማዋ ቱሪስቶችን አትስብም** (The city does not attract tourists) - The passage directly contradicts this, stating it *is* a tourist attraction.

የበጋ ኦሊምፒክ መቼ ነበር የታቀደው? ,"The correct answer is **D: ጁላይ 2020**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""…የ2020 በረራዎትን እና ማረፊያዎትን አስመዝግበው ከሆነ አስቸጋሪ ሁኔታ ውስጥ ሊሆኑ ይችላሉ። የመሰረዝ መምሪያዎች ይለያያሉ፣ ግን እስከ ማርች መጨረሻ ባለው አብዛኞቹ ኮሮናቫይረስን መሰረት ያደረጉ የመሰረዝ መምሪያዎች ኦሎምፒኮቹ እስከተቀጠሩበት እስከ ጁላይ 2020 አይቆዩም።"" This clearly indicates the Olympics were originally scheduled for July 2020.

በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ፈንገስ አውሎ ንፋስ የሚሆነው በምን ጊዜ ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: መሬቱን ከነካ በኋላ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""They [tornadoes] become “tornadoes” when they begin to descend from a thunderstorm cloud and touch the ground."" This directly indicates that a funnel cloud *becomes* a tornado upon making contact with the ground.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ነፋሶች በሰዓት 100 ማይል አካባቢ ሲደርሱ** - The passage mentions high winds *associated* with tornadoes, but doesn't say this is when it *becomes* a tornado.
*   **B: የአየር ምሰሶዎች መዞር ሲጀምሩ** - While tornadoes are rotating, the passage doesn't define rotation as the moment it becomes a tornado.
*   **C: ከአውሎ ነፋስ ደመና ሲወርድ** - The passage says it starts to become a tornado when descending, but the definitive step is touching the ground.



"
ከእነዚህ ውስጥ የአውሎ ነፋሱ ትክክለኛ ባህሪ የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ሁልጊዜ በሰዓት ከ100-200 ማይል አካባቢ ንፋስ ያመነጫሉ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""they produce high winds (often ranging from 100-200 miles/hour).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ብዙውን ጊዜ በከባድ ዕቃዎች ይንቀሳቀሳሉ** - The passage says they *can* lift heavy objects, not that they always do.
* **C: መሬቱን ከነካ በኋላ ፈንሾች ይሆናሉ** - The passage states they become ""tornadoes"" when they touch the ground, not funnels. (While a funnel *shape* is associated with a tornado, the tornado *is* the event, not just the shape.)
* **D: አየሩን ወደ ውጭ የሚገፉ የሚሽከረከሩ ዓምዶች ናቸው** - The passage states they pull air *inward and upward*, not outward.

በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ተጓዥ በመድረሻ ከተማ ስላለው የፖለቲካ ሁኔታ ምክር ከየት ማግኘት አለበት?,"The correct answer is **D: ከራሳቸው መንግስት**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ከራስዎ ሌላ የመንግስታትን ምክር ሊያማክሩም ሊፈልጉ ይችላሉ ነገር ግን የነሱ ምክር ለነሱ ዜጎች የተነደፈ ነው።"" This directly translates to ""You may also want to consult the advice of other governments, but their advice is designed for their citizens.""

Therefore, the passage suggests relying on **your own government** for advice, as it will be most relevant to *your* situation as a citizen of that country. The passage also cautions that advice from other governments is geared towards *their* citizens and may not apply to you.

የጉዞ ማሳሰቢያ በሚሰጥበት ጊዜ የውጭ አገር ዜጋ ሊያጋጥመው የማይችለው ነገር ምንድን ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: የሀገሪቱን የፖለቲካ ሁኔታ በተመለከተ ዝርዝር መረጃ**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that travel advisories are *brief summaries* of a country's political situation. It also notes that the views presented are often *general, broad, and highly varied* when compared to more detailed information. Therefore, a foreign citizen would **not** receive detailed information about a country's political situation from a travel advisory.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የተጎዳው የስረዛ ኢንሹራንስ:** The passage says travel insurance (including cancellation coverage) *can be* affected by travel advisories.
*   **B: የሀገሪቱን የፖለቲካ ሁኔታ በተመለከተ ከልክ ያለፈ ማጠቃለያ:** The passage states advisories *are* brief summaries, implying they are not comprehensive.
*   **C: የተጎዳ የጤና መድን:** Similar to A, the passage says travel health insurance *can be* affected.

Here's why:

* The passage states that most travel agents cater to common travel needs and destinations. A business conference trip to a city is a very common and straightforward travel arrangement.  It doesn't require the specialized knowledge or unique planning often provided by a travel agent.
* Options B, C, and D all suggest travel needs that *benefit* from a travel agent's expertise:
    * **B:** A two-week trip on a specific budget requires planning and finding deals.
    * **C:** Language barriers necessitate someone who can help with logistics and communication.
    * **D:** A first-time international traveler likely needs guidance and support.

Therefore, the passage implies that a standard business trip is the type of travel least likely to require a travel agent’s assistance."
በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ መንገደኛ ከተጓዥ ወኪል እርዳታ የበለጠ የሚጠቀመው በየትኛው ሁኔታ ውስጥ ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: ተጓዡ ለመጀመሪያ ጊዜ ልዩ ሽርሽር ለመያዝ ፍላጎት ሲኖረው (The traveler wants to take a unique trip for the first time).**

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agents are a good option for travelers wanting experiences *different* from their normal surroundings - ""a journey differing from the experiences of their former natural, cultural or geographic homeland."" This directly relates to someone wanting to try a unique trip. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** Booking connecting flights to visit a hometown is a fairly standard travel need, not one requiring a specialist agent.
*   **C:** Knowing the local language of a destination would *reduce* the need for an agent.
*   **D:** If someone is accustomed to cultural differences, they are less likely to need the specialized knowledge a travel agent might provide.

በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ አንድ መንገደኛ አዲስ ቦታዎችን ሲጎበኝ ብስጭት እንዳይፈጠር ምን ሊረዳው ይችላል?,"Correct answer: **A: ከየት እንደመጡ ተመሳሳይ ደረጃዎችን በመጠባበቅ ላይ**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Do not expect things to be like 'home' when you travel."" It emphasizes that food, laws, customs, traffic, accommodation, measurements, and language *will* be different.
* **Option A** aligns perfectly with this. Expecting things to be different (not expecting the same standards as home) is key to avoiding frustration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ያልተለመዱ ምግቦችን ለመሞከር ፈቃደኛነት (Willingness to try unfamiliar foods):** While trying new foods is good, the passage isn't *primarily* about food. It's about broader expectations.
* **C: ከየት እንደመጡ ተመሳሳይ ህጎችን ማክበር (Respecting the same laws as where they come from):** The passage actually implies the opposite – laws *will* be different and you need to be aware of that.
* **D: ስለ ማረፊያ ቅድመ ምርምርን ማስወገድ (Avoiding pre-trip research on accommodation):** The passage doesn’t say anything about avoiding research; it encourages awareness and preparation for differences.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that things will be different in a new place – food, rules, traffic, customs, language, etc. It stresses the importance of *not* expecting things to be like ""home"" and of being accepting of different ways of doing things. A person with a closed mind (ዝግ አእምሮ ያለው ሰው) would be inflexible, expect things to be the same everywhere, and likely be frustrated and unhappy when they encounter differences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: እንግዳ የሆኑ ምግቦችን የሚወድ ሰው (A person who likes strange foods)** – This person would likely *enjoy* the differences.
*   **B: በለውጥ ላይ የሚያድግ ሰው (A person who grows with change)** – This person would be adaptable and able to handle the differences easily.
*   **D: መማር የሚያስደስት ሰው (A person who enjoys learning)** – This person would be eager to explore and understand the new culture.

ታዳጊ ሀገርን ለመጀመሪያ ጊዜ ለሚጎበኙ መንገደኞች ከሚከተሉት የማይመከር የቱ ነው?,"The correct answer is **B: በመጀመሪያዎቹ ጥቂት ቀናትዎ ውስጥ በምግብ ላይ መበከልን ያስወግዱ**.

Here's why:

The passage *recommends* spending money on Western-style and quality hotels, food, and services *to help adjust* to a new environment. It doesn't suggest avoiding local food altogether, but rather starting with familiar comforts while you acclimate. The passage doesn't suggest avoiding trying food but rather to be cautious in the beginning.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: መሬት ላይ ከመተኛትዎ በፊት የአካባቢውን እንስሳት ይወቁ** - The passage explicitly states: ""Of course, you should learn about local fauna before sleeping on the ground.""
*   **C: ካምፕ ወደ ውጭ ከሄዱ አልጋ ወይም መዶሻ ይመከራል** - The passage advises using a cot or hammock when camping ""to protect yourself from snakes, scorpions, and similar creatures.""
*   **D: መጀመሪያ ሲደርሱ ጥራት ያለው ሆቴል ውስጥ ኢንቨስት ያድርጉ** - The passage directly suggests spending money on ""Western-style and quality hotels"" in your first few days.



"
ከሚከተሉት ወደ ታዳጊ ሀገር ሲገቡ ገንብዘብ ማባከኛ ተብሎ ያልተጠቀሰው የቱ ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ለካምፕ የሚሆን ፍራሽ ወይም ፓድ**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically recommends spending money on Western-style hotels, quality hotels, and quality services to ease the culture shock when first visiting a developing country. It *also* recommends bringing your own bedding (air mattress or cot) if camping to avoid sleeping on the ground where you might encounter creatures. 

However, it **doesn't** recommend spending money on Western-style food. It suggests using your money for better accommodations and services as a temporary measure to adjust.  Spending money *on* Western food isn't presented as a way to adapt to the culture.

Therefore, option C is the one thing not mentioned as a way to spend money to make the transition easier."

Here's why:

* **The question specifically states the person has *no* internet access.** This eliminates options B (emailing) and D (cloud storage).
* Option A (giving a copy to a travel companion) is good practice, but doesn't guarantee the policy owner *themselves* have immediate access. They are reliant on another person.
* Option C ensures the policy owner has a readily available, offline copy on a device they are already traveling with (as stated in the prompt). This directly addresses the need for access *without* internet.

በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ በፖሊሲው ላይ መታየት የማይፈልገው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: የመመሪያው ባለቤት የኢሜይል አድራሻ**.

Here's why:

The prompt specifically states that the policy copy should include the *insurer's* email address and international phone numbers for claims/permissions. It doesn't mention the policyholder's email address needing to be on the copy. The focus is on information needed to contact the insurance provider.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the prompt:

*   **A: የይገባኛል ጥያቄ ለማቅረብ ዓለም አቀፍ ስልክ ቁጥሮች** - The prompt explicitly asks for international phone numbers for submitting claims.
*   **B: የኢንሹራንስ ሰጪው ኢሜይል አድራሻ** - The prompt explicitly asks for the insurer's email address.
*   **C: ዓለም አቀፍ ስልክ ቁጥሮች ለፈቃዶች** - The prompt explicitly asks for international phone numbers for permissions."

The passage states: ""መደበኛ 35 ሚሜ ፊልም (36 በ 24 ሚሜ ኔጌቲቭ) በጣም የተለመደው ነው።"" which translates to ""Standard 35mm film (36 by 24mm negative) is the most common.""

While the passage discusses other formats, it explicitly identifies 36x24mm as the *most common*.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that 35mm film ""gives a quality resolution comparable to that of a current DSLR."" The other options (medium-format, 56x56mm, and 6x6cm) are described as having *higher* resolution than 35mm, not comparable to a DSLR.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""After you are comfortable with writing and editing, then you can create your own website."" This clearly indicates that creating your own website is the final step *after* developing your writing and editing skills.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የድር ቅርጸትን ይለማመዱ (Learn web design)** - The passage doesn't mention learning web design specifically, just *creating* a website.
*   **B: ለታዋቂ የጉዞ ብሎግ ብዙ መጣጥፎችን ይጻፉ (Write a lot of articles for a popular travel blog)** - This is a preliminary step *before* creating your own website, according to the passage.
*   **D: የአርትዖት ችሎታዎን ያሳድጉ (Improve your editing skills)** -  This is also a skill to develop *before* the final step of creating your own website.

የጉዞ ጽሑፍ ንግድ ሲጀምሩ ከሚከተሉት ችሎታዎች ውስጥ በመጀመሪያ ማጥራት ያለበት የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **A: ብሎግ ማድረግ (Blogging)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the easiest way to start a travel writing business is to **develop your skills on a travel blog website.**  This means becoming comfortable with *blogging* itself is the first step.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: የድር ቅርጸት (Web Design):** While useful later, the passage says to start *on* an existing platform before creating your own website.
* **C: ማርተዕ (Marketing):** Marketing is important, but the passage places it as a step *after* getting comfortable with writing and blogging.
* **D: ድህረ ገጽ ፈጠረ (Website Creation):**  The passage suggests creating your *own* website comes *after* blogging on an existing site.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""P: በቤት ውስጥ ለአከባቢው ጀርሞች በተከታታይ መጋለጥ ምክንያት የመቋቋም አቅም በጣም ከፍ ያለ የመሆን እድሉ ከፍተኛ ነው።"" This directly translates to ""Repeated exposure to local germs in a home environment can lead to a very high likelihood of developing immunity.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: የአንጀት ችግር (Intestinal problems):** While intestinal problems are *mentioned* in the passage as being more common in warm climates, the passage doesn't say frequent exposure leads to them.
*   **C: የመተንፈስ ችግር (Respiratory problems):** These are mentioned as being more common in cold climates, not as a result of frequent exposure.
*   **D: Delhi Belly:** This is a specific example of a problem, not the result of developing immunity from exposure.

ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ በ Schengen ዞን ውስጥ መጓዝ ጥቅሙ የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ብዙ የፓስፖርት መቆጣጠሪያ ነጥቦችን ማስወገድ**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that within the Schengen Zone, you can cross borders ""without having to show your passport to border guards and going through immigration controls."" This directly relates to avoiding many passport control points.

Let's look at why the other options are not the *best* answer:

*   **A: ከብዙ የቪዛ ማመልከቻዎች መራቅ (Avoiding many visa applications)** - While the passage mentions this as a benefit of a Schengen visa, it's not the primary benefit of *traveling within* the Schengen Zone itself.
*   **B: ገንዘብ መቆጠብ (Saving money)** - The passage states that it saves money, but it's a consequence of reducing visa applications and passport control delays, not the primary benefit of the zone's existence.
*   **D: ፓስፖርት አያስፈልግም (Passport is not required)** - The passage doesn’t say passports aren’t needed, just that you don’t need to *show them* at borders within the zone. You still need a passport to enter the Schengen Area initially.



"
በTutankhamun መቃብር ውስጥ ምን ሊገኝ አይችልም?,"The correct answer is **D: ሀብቱ**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: አንዳንድ ማስጌጥ** - The passage states the tomb has ""ተወሰነ ጌጣጌጥ ያለው"" (limited decoration) meaning some decoration *is* still present.
*   **B: የእማዬ ጭንቅላት** - The passage mentions the skull is visible.
*   **C: የእማዬ ትከሻዎች** - The passage mentions the shoulders are visible.

Here's why:

The passage states Whistler is ""expensive"" and therefore less attractive to budget travelers. Granville Island is a starting point *to get to* Bowen Island, not a destination itself. The Sea to Sky Corridor is a route, not a destination.

Bowen Island is described as being easily accessible from Vancouver by water taxi (implying a relatively affordable transport option) and offers a variety of activities, making it the most appealing option for budget-conscious travelers according to the passage."

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Bowen Island is a popular day trip or weekend getaway... a real community just a short distance from Vancouver in Howe Sound."" It describes it as easily accessible *from* Vancouver and offering a variety of activities. This makes it a destination that complements a Vancouver trip.
* **Whistler** is described as more expensive and farther away (1.5-hour drive), making it less of a quick, accessible ""Vancouver experience.""
* **Vancouver Downtown** is where you *start* from to get to these destinations, not a destination itself for a day trip or getaway.
* **Granville Island** is mentioned only as a departure point for the water taxi *to* Bowen Island.

The passage states that during the rainy season (November to March) the waterfall is at its most full and impressive, *but* also that the spray makes it difficult to see clearly (""...makes viewing the falls a soaking affair."").  It implies that to avoid getting soaked and potentially have a clearer view, you should visit *outside* of the rainy season.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ከኖቬምበር እስከ መጋቢት** - This is the rainy season, when visibility is *reduced* due to spray.
*   **B: በቱሪስት ወቅት** - The passage doesn't specifically mention a tourist season, and it focuses on the effect of the water level.
*   **C: የውሃው መጠን ከፍ ባለበት ጊዜ** - This is also the rainy season, and again, leads to poor visibility.

በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ በኖቬምበር እና መጋቢት መካከል የቪክቶሪያ ፏፏቴዎችን ለመጎብኘት ምን ለውጥ ያመጣል?,"The correct answer is **C: የፏፏቴው አስደናቂ እይታዎች**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""በዝናባማው ወቅት(ኖቬምበር እስከ ማርች) የውሀ መጠኑ ከፍ የሚልበት ጊዜ ሲሆን ፏፋቴው በጣም አስደናቂ የተሞላ ይሆናል።"" This directly translates to the waterfall being most spectacular during November to March.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ያልተደበቁ የፏፏቴ እይታዎች:** The passage actually says the *sound* of the water obscures the view - it becomes harder to see *because* of the water, not easier.
*   **B: ጥቂት ቱሪስቶች:** The passage doesn't mention tourist numbers.
*   **D: የዝናብ ወቅትን ማስወገድ:** Visiting *during* the rainy season is what's discussed, not avoiding it.

በምንባቡ መሰረት፣ ለመቅረጽ ሰው አልባ አውሮፕላን ሲጠቀሙ ከሚከተሉት ውስጥ የትኛው አይመከርም?,"The correct answer is **D: ድራጊው የማይታወቅበት በተጨናነቁ አካባቢዎች ብቻ መቅረጽ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that flying a drone near airports or over crowds is often a bad idea, *even if* it's not explicitly illegal in your area.  Option D describes exactly that scenario – operating in crowded areas where the drone might not be easily seen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ለመቅረጽ የተፈቀደልዎትን አስቀድመው ያረጋግጡ** - The passage *strongly* encourages researching what you're allowed to film and any necessary permissions.
*   **B: ተጨማሪ ፈቃድ በማግኘት ላይ** -  The passage advises checking for required licenses, making this a proactive step.
*   **C: የጥናት ፈቃዶች** - This isn't discussed in the text, but obtaining necessary permissions (which could include study/flight certifications) is recommended.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states you should **research what you are allowed to film and what permits or additional licensing you need** *before* flying a drone. This directly implies the best place to film with a drone is where you've obtained the necessary permissions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በድሮኑ መኖር የማይጨነቁ ሰዎች አቅራቢያ** - While considerate, this doesn't address the legality of filming.
*   **B: መደበኛ ፎቶግራፍ ማንሳት በማይፈቀድባቸው አካባቢዎች** - The passage states if you can't take a *photo*, you shouldn't even *think* about filming a video.
*   **C: ድሮን ብዙም በማይታይባቸው በተጨናነቁ ቦታዎች** - This is dangerous and doesn’t address legal requirements. The passage warns against flying near people.

በንባቡ መመስረት፣ ለቪዛ ሂደት የምዝገባ መስፈርት የትኛው መግለጫ ትክክል አይደለም?,"The correct answer is **B: ሁሉም አገሮች ከአካባቢው ባለስልጣናት ጋር መመዝገብ አለባቸው**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""በአንዳንድ ሀገሮች፣ የት ቦታ እንዳረፍክና አድራሻህን ለሀገሬው ሀላፊዎች ማስመዝገብ የግድ ይኖርብሃል።"" (In some countries, you may need to register your location and address with local authorities).  This clearly indicates it's *not* all countries.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: በቱሪስት ማረፊያዎች ውስጥ የሚቆዩ ከሆነ፣ መመዝገብ ላያስፈልግ ይችላል** (If you stay in tourist accommodations, you may not need to register) - The passage supports this, saying registration may only be required for those *outside* tourist accommodations in some cases.
* **C: የኢሚግሬሽን ቢሮዎችን መጎብኘት ሊያስፈልግ ይችላል** (You may need to visit immigration offices) - The passage explicitly mentions visiting an immigration office as a way to register.
* **D: በአንዳንድ ቦታዎች፣ የሀገር ውስጥ ሆቴሎች ምዝገባውን ማስተናገድ ይችላሉ** (In some places, local hotels can handle the registration) - The passage directly states hotels may handle registration.

Here's why:

The text states that registration for tourists might involve:

*   Filling out a form at a local police station.
*   Visiting an immigration office.
*   Hotels sometimes handle the registration (but you should ask).

It does *not* mention any requirement to register at a local post office. Therefore, a tourist would not go to a post office to complete registration."

* **The passage states:** ""ብዙ የበጎ ፈቃድ ሥራዎች ክፍል እና ቦርድ ስለሚሰጡ ጥቂቶች ደግሞ አነስተኛ ደመወዝ ስለሚከፍሉ አንድ ቦታ ረዘም ላለ ጊዜ ለመቆየት በጀት ማራዘም ጥሩ መንገድ ሊሆን ይችላል።"" (Many volunteer positions offer room and board, and a few pay a small stipend, so it can be a good way to stretch your budget for a longer stay.) This implies volunteer work is *not* for those seeking high salaries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: አዲስ ጓደኞችን ለማፍራት የሚፈልግ ሰው ወደ ውጭ አገር ይሄዳል** - The passage specifically says volunteering is a great way to meet new people.
* **C: አዲስ ችሎታ ለማግኘት የሚፈልግ ሰው** - The passage states it’s a way to gain new skills.
* **D: ክፍል እና ቦርድ ላይ ፍላጎት ያለው ሰው** - The passage highlights that many volunteer positions provide room and board.

* **The passage specifically states:** ""ብዙ የበጎ ፈቃድ ሥራዎች ክፍል እና ቦርድ ስለሚሰጡ ጥቂቶች ደግሞ አነስተኛ ደመወዝ ስለሚከፍሉ አንድ ቦታ ረዘም ላለ ጊዜ ለመቆየት በጀት ማራዘም ጥሩ መንገድ ሊሆን ይችላል።"" (Many volunteer jobs provide room and board, and a few pay a small stipend, making it a good way to stretch your budget for a longer stay.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ደሞዝ ሁልጊዜ ማለት ይቻላል ይሰጣል (Salary is almost always provided):** The passage says *some* pay a small stipend, not that salary is guaranteed.
* **B: ብዙውን ጊዜ ወደ ሥራ ዕድሎች ይመራል (Often leads to job opportunities):** While possible, the passage doesn't focus on job opportunities.
* **D: የአመለካከት ስሜትን እንድታገኝ ሊረዳህ ይችላል (Can help you find a sense of perspective):**  This is a benefit mentioned, but not how it helps with the *budget*.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that a typical visit involves flying into Orlando, taking a Disney bus to a Disney hotel, spending a week *on Disney property*, and returning home. This indicates the journey is entirely within the Disney ""bubble.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ፓርኮችን በማሰስ አንድ ሳምንት ጊዜ ያሳልፋሉ** - While true, this is a *part* of the typical trip, not the defining characteristic.
*   **B: ከጣቢያ ውጭ ሆቴል ውስጥ መቆየት** - The passage explicitly states staying at a *Disney* hotel.
*   **D: ከአውሮፕላን ማረፊያ ወደ ሆቴል አውቶቡስ መውሰድ** - This is also a part of the trip, but doesn't encapsulate the overall nature of a typical Disney World visit."

Here's why:

The passage states that books and magazines on desert survival are ""common,"" implying this information is widely available *outside* of the professional training. The training focuses specifically on preparing for war zones, and explicitly lists role-playing, first aid, and sometimes military tactics *as part of the training*.  While desert survival knowledge might be *useful* in some war zones, it's not a core component of the specialized training described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: የመጀመሪያ እርዳታ ዝግጁነት (First Aid Preparedness):** The passage directly mentions first aid as a key part of the training.
* **C: የጦርነት ዞን ዝግጁነት (War Zone Preparedness):** This is the overarching goal of the training, and the passage emphasizes its detail.
* **D: ሚና መጫወት (Role-Playing):** The passage specifically lists role-playing as an activity within the training.

Here's why:

The passage states that the training ""regularly includes… much first aid.""  The other options are mentioned as related resources (desert survival books) or potential topics (war zone areas), but first aid is explicitly listed as part of the training itself.

* **B: የጦርነት ቀጠናዎች** - The passage mentions discussion *about* war zones, but not training *in* them as a core component.
* **C: የበረሃ መትረፍ** - Desert survival books are mentioned, but not the training itself.
* **D: ጠበኛ አካባቢዎች** - This isn't mentioned in the text.

Here's why:

The passage states that filters vary in effectiveness and *if you are concerned* you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company. This implies bottled water is the most reliable option when it comes to ensuring water is safe to drink.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ውሃን ለብዙ ደቂቃዎች ቀቅለው** (Boil the water for several minutes) - The passage mentions boiling, but also says the required time *varies* and may not be enough in all areas.
*   **C: ለአንድ ደቂቃ ያህል ውሃ ቀቅለው** (Boil the water for one minute) - The passage explicitly states this might *not* be sufficient in some locations.
*   **D: ለተወሰኑ ስጋቶች ውሃውን ይገምግሙ** (Filter the water for certain concerns) - The passage states filters *vary* in effectiveness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ወደ ሪፎች ቅርብ በሆነ ቦታ ላይ መዋኘት:** The passage explains rip currents *originate* near reefs, but doesn't say swimming near them is inherently impossible. It's the current itself that's the danger.
*   **B: በጥልቅ ውሃ ውስጥ መዋኘት:** While rip currents *can* lead to deeper water, the passage doesn't say swimming in deep water is the problem.
*   **D: በማዕበል ዙሪያ መዋኘት:** The passage discusses rip currents, not whirlpools/maelstroms (which is what ""ma'ebel"" likely refers to)."

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ብዙ ሞቶች፣ ሊሆን በማይችለው፣ ከሞገዱ በተቃራኒ ለመዋኘት በመሞከር ድካም ምክንያት ይከሰታሉ።"" This means fighting *directly* against the rip current is tiring and often ineffective.
* **The passage also suggests:**  ""...ካሉበት እንደወጡ ወዲያውኑ ወደኋላ መዋኘት ከተለመደው የበለጠ ከባድ አይደለም."" This implies swimming *parallel* to the shore to escape the current is a good strategy.  Option A reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ከአሁኑ ጋር በፍጥነት ይዋኙ:** Swimming *with* the current will just take you further out to sea.
* **C: በተቃራኒው አቅጣጫ ይዋኙ:** As the passage states, this is a common mistake and leads to exhaustion.
* **D: ከመሬት በታች ይዋኙ:** This is not a recommended or effective strategy for escaping a rip current.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions visiting castles in the **Loire Valley and Rhine Valley** as examples of waterway-based tourism. While other options are mentioned as potential destinations, the Rhine Valley is directly cited as a location with castles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: በDanube አጠገብ ያለ ከተማ** - The passage mentions river cruises *to* cities on the Danube, but not specifically castle visits there.
*   **B: ከ Erie ቦይ ቀጥሎ** - The passage mentions travelling *through* the Erie Canal, not castle visits.
*   **D: ከማንኛውም የውስጥ የውሃ መስመር አጠገብ** - While true, this is too broad. The question asks for a *specific* area known for castle visits *according to the passage*.

Here's why:

The text explicitly advises women to **avoid discussing their marital status** (""ሴቶች፡ የትኛውም የሴቶች ተጓዦች ትክክለኛ የጋብቻ ሁኔታ ምንም ይሁን ምን ማግባታቸውን ቢናገሩ ይመከራል።"").  The other options are either supported by or irrelevant to the text:

* **B:** The text warns about cultural differences and potential misunderstandings (""ሴቶች የባህል ልዩነቶች እነሱ ትንኮሳ ብለው ወደሚያስቡት እንደሚያመራ ማሰብ አለባቸው"").
* **C:** The text suggests wearing a ring (even a non-expensive one), implying some jewelry is acceptable.  It doesn't say to avoid *all* jewelry.
* **D:** The text encourages women to be firm and stand their ground when saying ""no"" (""ወንዶችን እምቢ በማለት ላይ ጠንካራ ይሁኑ"").

Therefore, avoiding discussion of marital status is the direct, negative recommendation given in the passage.

Here's why:

* **The text specifically states:** ""...ሴቶች የባህል ልዩነቶች እነሱ ትንኮሳ ብለው ወደሚያስቡት እንደሚያመራ ማሰብ አለባቸው እና መከተል እና በእጅ መጎተት ወዘተ. ያልተለመደ አይደለም።"" (Women should be aware that cultural differences might lead them to think following and hand-holding etc. is not uncommon). This directly advises women to be aware that these actions, which might seem inappropriate in their culture, are common in this region.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: የማርሻል ሁኔታን ለማመልከት ትልቅ ቀለበት ያድርጉ (Wear a large ring to indicate marital status):** While the text *mentions* wearing a ring, it says ""ብዙ ውድ የማይመስል ይሁን እንጂ"" (even if it doesn't look expensive) – implying it's a subtle indicator, not a large, statement ring.
* **C: የባህል ልዩነቶች አቋምህን ከመቆም እንድትቆጠብ እንደሚጠቁም ተረዳ (Understand that cultural differences suggest you should refrain from standing your ground):** The text advises women to *be firm* in refusing unwanted advances (""ወንዶችን እምቢ በማለት ላይ ጠንካራ ይሁኑ"") – the opposite of giving up their stance.
* **D: የማይፈለጉ እድገቶችን በተመለከተ, ወንዶችን በመቃወም ጠንከር ያለ ይሁኑ (Be strong in resisting unwanted advances from men):**  While true, this is a general safety tip and not the *specific* advice highlighted within the text concerning cultural understanding in this region.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While parks having rules is mentioned, it doesn't relate to needing a *different* lens.
* **C:** Animals being wary doesn't change the lens requirement. It's a challenge for the photographer, not a reason to use a different lens.
* **D:** Park regulations also don't dictate the type of lens to use. They affect *if* you can take photos for commercial purposes, not *how*.

    * Difficulty finding animals (A - ""አብዛኛውን ብርቅዪ እንሰሳቶች ለማግኘትአስቸጋሪ ናቸው"")
    * Needing different lenses (C - ""አብዛኛውን ጊዜ ረዥም የቴሌፎቶ ሌንስ የሚፈልግ ቢሆንም የአእዋፍ መንጋ ወይም ትናንሽ ፍጥረታት ሌላ ሌንሶች ያስፈልጋቸዋል።"")
    * Working in challenging environments (D - ""አከባቢው ቀዝቃዛ፣ ሙቅ፣ ወይም አስፈሪ ሊሆን ይችላል።"")

* **The passage *does not* mention:** The physical danger posed by powerful or aggressive animals. While it says animals can be ""ጠበኛ"" (wary/suspicious), it doesn't address the risk of being *attacked* or needing to physically cope with dangerous wildlife.

Therefore, **B** is the most logical answer as a potential challenge not explicitly mentioned in the text."

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the dangers of ice, black ice, and reduced visibility.**  While all options present challenges, the passage specifically highlights how even *small* amounts of ice can drastically reduce traction. Light snow is most likely to *become* ice, and the passage focuses on the dangers of ice more than substantial snowfall.
* **Let's look at why the other options are less likely:**
    * **A: ከባድ ትራፊክ (Heavy traffic):**  Heavy traffic itself isn't directly caused by mountain passes or cold weather. It's a complication, but not the primary concern the passage raises.
    * **C: ከመጠን በላይ እርጥበት (Excessive moisture):** The passage focuses on the formation of *ice* from moisture, not just moisture itself.  Moisture is a precursor to the problem, not the problem itself.
    * **D: የቀነሰ እይታ (Reduced visibility):** While reduced visibility *is* a concern mentioned in the passage, it's due to falling snow or frost on windows. Light flurries, while reducing visibility, are less dangerous than the ice they can create.

The passage stresses that even a small amount of ice can be incredibly dangerous, making light snow (and its potential to become ice) the biggest challenge for a driver in mountain passes.

Here's why:

The passage states that while tax *rates* and *deductions* vary greatly between countries (and even within countries like the US and Canada), the fundamental *structure* of income tax is what's being discussed as potentially consistent.  ""Structure"" refers to the basic *entity* or form of the tax itself - the idea of taxing income.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሬቶች (Rates)** - The passage explicitly says rates *differ*.
*   **C: የላኩበት (The Sender)** - This is irrelevant to the tax system itself.
*   **D: ቅንፍ (Deduction)** - Like rates, deductions are also stated to vary.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""generally working abroad means you will need to file income tax in your country of residence.""  This directly implies that your tax obligations are tied to where you are *based* or reside, not necessarily where you are earning the income.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: በዩናይትድ ስቴትስ ውስጥ** (In the United States): The passage doesn't specify the US. It speaks generally about countries.
*   **C: አሁን እየሰሩ ባሉበት ሀገር** (In the country where you are currently working): While you might have tax obligations *in* that country as well, the passage focuses on your home country (residence).
*   **D: የትም ክፍያዎች ዝቅተኛ ናቸው** (Payments are low everywhere): This is irrelevant to the question of *where* to file taxes.

ከሚከተሉት መግለጫዎች የአለምን አውደ ራዕይ በትክክል የማይገልጸው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: አገሮች መሳተፍ አይጠበቅባቸውም**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ተሳታፊ ሀገሮች የዓለምን ጉዳዮች ወይም የሀገራቸውን ባህል እና ታሪክ የሚያሳይ በብሔራዊ ሙዚየሞች ውስጥ ጥበባዊ እና ትምህርታዊ ማሳያዎችን ያቀርባሉ።"" (Participating countries present artistic and educational exhibits showcasing world issues or their country's culture and history.) This directly contradicts option D.

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct based on the passage:

* **A: ማሳያዎች የሀገርን ታሪክ ወይም ባህል ሊያሳዩ ይችላሉ** - The passage confirms this.
* **B: የእጽዋት ማሳያዎች ከሥነ ጥበባዊ እና ትምህርታዊ ትዕይንቶች ጎን ለጎን ይታያሉ** - The passage explains that World Expositions and International Horticultural Expositions *both* feature exhibits, though the latter focuses specifically on horticulture.
* **C: ዝግጅቶች እስከ ስድስት ወር ድረስ ሊቆዩ ይችላሉ** - The passage states these events typically last between three and six months.

ከሚከተሉት የትኛው የአለም ትርኢት ወይም አለም አቀፍ ኤክስፖሲሽን ህግ ነው?,"The correct answer is **C: ዝግጅቶች እስከ ስድስት ወር ድረስ መቆየት አለባቸው**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""These expositions are typically held for three to six months...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the passage says expositions *can* showcase both, it doesn't state it's a *requirement* (""should"" vs. ""must"").
*   **B:** The passage says they *could* happen annually if different countries hosted, but notes that practically they don't. It doesn’t state it’s a rule that a country *cannot* host yearly.
*   **D:** The passage doesn’t mention any obligation for all countries to participate. It speaks of ""participating countries"" implying participation is optional."
ከሚከተሉት የትኛውን ማድረጉ የእንስሳትን ጥቃት የመቀነስ እድልን ይቀንሳል?,"Correct answer: **A: ጥሩ መዓዛ ያላቸው ዕፅዋት መሸከም**

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states:** ""Know that scents attract bears and other wildlife; therefore, avoid bringing or making scented foods and keep your campsite clean."" This means carrying strongly scented items *increases* the risk of attracting animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ቆሻሻን ከካምፕ ውስጥ በማስወገድ ላይ (Removing trash from your campsite)** – This is a good practice and *reduces* the risk of attracting animals.
*   **C: ከተኩላዎች 25 ያርድ ርቀትን መጠበቅ (Maintaining a 25-yard distance from elk)** – The passage recommends keeping 25 yards from *all* animals, so this is what you *should* do, not what reduces the risk of attack.
*   **D: እንስሳትን በምግብ ፍርስራሾች መከላከል (Defending animals with food scraps)** – This is actively dangerous and would *increase* the risk of attack.

"
ከሚከተሉት የዱር እንስሳትን ጥቃት መንስኤ ሊሆን የሚችለው በንባቡ ውስጥ ያልተጠቀሰው የትኛው ነው?,"The correct answer is **D: ከሰዎች ጋር የማይተዋወቁ እንስሳት**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage focuses on maintaining distance and avoiding attracting animals with scents.** It explicitly states that most animals in parks are used to people, but still wild and potentially dangerous. The passage never mentions that unfamiliarity with humans is a cause of attacks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ጠንካራ ሽታዎች (Strong smells):** The passage specifically states that scents attract bears and other wildlife.
*   **B: ርቀትን መጠበቅ አለመቻል (Failure to maintain distance):** The passage emphasizes keeping a safe distance (100 yards from bears/cougars, 25 yards from other animals) and warns about injuries from not doing so.
*   **C: የዱር እንስሳትን መመገብ (Feeding wild animals):** The passage explicitly states *not* to feed animals.
