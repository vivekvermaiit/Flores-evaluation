根据这段文字，以下哪项不会被认为是成功演奏手风琴的准确技巧？,"The correct answer is **A: 用力敲击琴键来提升音量 (Using force when pressing keys to increase volume)**.

Here's why:

The passage *specifically states* that you should **not** play the accordion like a piano and use force on the keys to get louder. It explicitly says to increase volume by working the bellows (拉风箱) with more force or speed.

Let's look at why the other options are correct techniques according to the passage:

* **B: 尽量减少不必要的动作来节省体力 (Minimize unnecessary movements to conserve energy):** The passage directly encourages this.
* **C: 在手部放松的同时注意正确敲击音符 (Play notes correctly while keeping your hands as relaxed as possible):**  This is a core principle outlined in the text.
* **D: 以更快的速度拉风箱来提升音量 (Increase volume by pulling the bellows faster):**  The passage explicitly mentions this as a way to increase volume.



"
在演奏手风琴时，以下哪些做法可以提高音量？,"The correct answers are **A: 更快的速度** and **B: 更用力**.

The passage explicitly states: ""为了提高手风琴的音量，可以更用力或以更快的速度拉风箱。"" (To increase the volume of the accordion, you can pull the bellows with more force or at a faster speed.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **C: 少用力** - The passage says to *increase* force, not decrease it.
* **D: 更少的手指动作** - While minimizing unnecessary finger movement is good for conserving energy, it doesn't directly impact volume. The passage focuses on bellows control for volume.



"
为什么电视画面的边框被裁剪了？,"The correct answer is **B: 为了让图像能覆盖住整个屏幕**.

The passage explicitly states: ""这样做是为了保证图像能覆盖住整个屏幕。这叫做“过度扫描”."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 为了让字幕能够显示** - The passage actually states that *subtitles can be cut off* due to overscanning.
*   **C: 为了便于将其转换成其他格式** - The passage doesn't mention anything about converting to other formats as the reason for cropping.
*   **D: 为了裁剪太靠近底部的字幕** -  The passage says subtitles *might* be cut off *as a result* of overscanning, not as the reason *for* it.



"
根据这段文字，将电影转换成 DVD 格式时，可能会遇到以下哪个问题？,"The correct answer is **B: 字幕被部分裁剪掉**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that ""if the subtitles are too close to the bottom, the subtitles will also be displayed incompletely"" due to overscanning when making a DVD.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 图像未能覆盖住整个屏幕:** The passage explains overscanning *causes* the image to cover the entire screen, not fail to do so.
* **C: 图像覆盖住整个屏幕:** While true as a *result* of overscanning, it's not the *problem* the passage identifies with DVD conversion.
* **D: 边框被裁剪掉:** The passage states the edges of the original image (top, bottom, and sides) are cropped *originally* for television, and this cropping can be repeated when making DVDs, but the problem it highlights is the impact on subtitles.



"
哪里有一支英国守军驻扎？,"The correct answer is **C: 波登镇**.

The passage states: ""约翰·卡德瓦德将军将向波登镇的英国守军发动一场进攻..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 阿森皮克湾** - The passage says James Ewing occupied the bridge *over* Assunpink Creek, it doesn't state there was a garrison there.
* **B: 特伦顿** - Trenton is where the main force was heading *to* attack, not where a garrison was.
* **D: 普林斯顿** - Princeton isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
手写草案上出现了谁的签名？,"The correct answer is **D: 查尔斯·汤姆逊 (Charles Thomson)**.

The text states the draft was signed by ""President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson"". While John Hancock is also a signer, Charles Thomson is specifically mentioned alongside him.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 约翰·邓拉普 (John Dunlap)** - He *printed* the document, he didn't sign the original draft.
* **B: 乔治·华盛顿 (George Washington)** - He *received* and read a copy, but didn't sign the original.
* **C: 约翰·尼克松 (John Nixon)** - He *read it publicly*, but didn't sign the original.



"
在以下地点中，“邓拉普宽边”最后抵达的地点是哪个？,"The correct answer is **C: 伦敦**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""一份副本于 8 月 10 日抵达伦敦"" (A copy arrived in London on August 10th). This indicates London was the final destination mentioned for a copy of the Dunlap broadsides.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 纽约** - While the declaration was read to the army in New York, that happened *before* it reached London.
*   **B: 邓拉普的印刷厂** - The broadsides were *printed* at Dunlap's printing shop, but that was the starting point, not the final destination.
*   **D: 独立大厅** - The declaration was first publicly read at Independence Hall, but that was also before it reached London."
斯塔克上校的部队位于哪里？,"The correct answer is **A: 在北端，沿着围栏**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""斯塔克(Stark) 的士兵沿着殖民者阵地北端的防御围栏站位。"" (Stark's soldiers positioned themselves along the defensive fence at the north end of the colonial lines.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 在水边的海滩上** - While they *built* a wall extending *to* the beach, they weren't initially *located* there.
*   **C: 沿着半岛的东北部** - This describes the general area of the river, not where Stark's troops were positioned.
*   **D: 在围栏前面** - The text mentions a stake being placed *in front* of the fence, but doesn't say Stark's troops were positioned there, only that they were *along* the fence.



"
根据这段文字，斯塔克的士兵在什么时候延伸他们的围栏？,"The correct answer is **C: 在退潮时**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""退潮时，沿半岛东北部流淌的神秘河打开了一道缺口，他们迅速建起一堵短石墙，把围墙延伸到岸边北端的小海滩上。"" (When the tide went out, the Mystic River flowing along the northeast of the peninsula opened a gap, and they quickly built a short stone wall, extending the fence to the small beach at the northern end of the shore.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 在殖民者要求增援时** - While the text mentions the colonists requesting reinforcements, this happened *before* the fence was extended.
*   **B: 在正规军通过木桩后** - The text says firing was *not* allowed until the regulars passed the stake, not that the fence extension happened then.
*   **D: 当部队进入前沿阵地时** - The fence was extended to *strengthen* the front line, not when troops arrived.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪个是中国最暴力的时代之一？,"The correct answer is **D: 三国时期**.

The passage explicitly states: ""三国是中国古代历史上最血腥的时代之一。"" (The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most bloody eras in ancient Chinese history.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 晋朝** - The passage mentions the Three Kingdoms period *between* the Han and Jin dynasties, but doesn't describe the Jin dynasty as violent.
* **B: 西安时期** - The passage mentions西安 (Xi'an) as the location of a palace where power was fought over, but doesn't identify a ""Xi'an period"" as a particularly violent era.
* **C: 汉朝** - The passage states the Three Kingdoms period came *after* the Han dynasty, and doesn't claim the Han dynasty itself was the most violent.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项陈述关于行军蚁群进入迁徙阶段是正确的？,"The correct answer is **B: 它们食物供应匮乏 (They have a scarce food supply)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""当可利用的食物减少时，这个蚁群就会迎来迁徙期。"" (When available food decreases, the ant colony enters the migration period.) This directly links the start of the migration phase to a lack of food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 它们在夜间筑巢 (They build nests at night)** - The passage says they *travel* at night and *rest* during the day.
*   **C: 它们建造的巢穴每 17 天更换一次 (The nests they build are changed every 17 days)** - They change their *temporary* nests *daily*, not every 17 days. The 17 days refers to the length of the entire migratory phase.
*   **D: 它们在白天出行 (They travel during the day)** - The passage states they travel at *night*.



"
根据这段文字，哪项陈述准确反映了军蚁群体在游牧阶段的筑巢习惯？,"The correct answer is **C: 它们每天更换巢穴**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...蚁群会建造每天更换的临时巢穴 (the ant colony builds temporary nests that are changed daily).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 它们在夜间筑巢 (They build nests at night)** - The passage says they *travel* at night and *rest* during the day.
* **B: 它们在连续出行 17 天后才筑巢 (They only build nests after traveling continuously for 17 days)** - The passage states the entire nomadic phase lasts about 17 days, and they build *daily* nests within that phase.
* **D: 它们在这个阶段期间使用同样的巢穴 (They use the same nest throughout this phase)** - The passage directly contradicts this, stating they change nests *daily*.



"
以下哪项尽管存在外界提示也会持续发生？,"The correct answer is **C: 生物钟**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""生物钟是能够自我维持的摆动装置，即使在没有外界提示的情况下，也会持续一段时间自由运转的周期。"" (Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillating devices that will continue to run for a period of time even in the absence of external cues.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 内生周期 (Endogenous cycles):** While related to biological clocks, the passage describes *biological clocks* as *generating* these cycles. The passage doesn't explicitly state endogenous cycles continue without cues.
* **B: 周期性的节奏 (Periodic rhythms):** The passage states these rhythms aren't *just* responses to external cues, but doesn't define them as continuing *despite* cues.
* **D: 观察到的节律 (Observed rhythms):** These are the result of both internal and external factors and aren't defined as continuing without external prompts.

Therefore, only the **biological clock** is described as functioning independently of external cues."
哪个术语描述了展示某一表型性状变体的个体？,"The correct answer is **D: 多态 (Polymorphic)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""当个体表现出某一性状的几个变体时，它们就是多态的。"" (When individuals exhibit several variations of a trait, they are polymorphic.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 单型 (Monomorphic):** The passage defines this as *complete* similarity in a trait, the opposite of variation.
* **B: 生物体 (Organism):** This is a general term for a living thing, not specifically related to trait variation within a population.
* **C: 种类 (Species):** This refers to a group of organisms that can interbreed, but doesn't describe variation *within* that group.



"
以下哪项是指占据特定区域的生物体？,"The correct answer is **B: 种群 (Population)**.

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""种群是指在特定地理区域内特定种类生物体的集合 (A population refers to a collection of organisms of a particular species within a specific geographic area).""  This directly defines what the question is asking for.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 单型 (Monomorphic):** This describes a *characteristic* of a population (all individuals being the same for a trait), not the organisms themselves.
* **C: 种类 (Species):**  While related to populations, a species is a broader classification – it's a group of organisms capable of interbreeding, not necessarily those in a specific location.
* **D: 多态 (Polymorphic):** This describes a population with *variation* in a trait, not the organisms inhabiting a region.



"
以下哪项不是以自然风光旅游活动的例子？,"The correct answer is **C: 参观科学博物馆 (Visiting a science museum)**.

Here's why:

* **Natural scenery tourism** focuses on appreciating and experiencing *natural* environments. The passage specifically mentions activities like observing wildlife, photography in nature, and exploring ecosystems.

Let's look at each option:

* **A: 徒步旅行到瀑布 (Hiking to a waterfall)** - This is directly related to experiencing a natural landscape.
* **B: 拍摄野花 (Photographing wildflowers)** - This is an example of nature photography, mentioned in the passage.
* **C: 参观科学博物馆 (Visiting a science museum)** - While science *can* relate to nature, a museum is a constructed, artificial environment. It doesn't fall under the category of directly engaging with natural scenery.
* **D: 飞钓 (Fly fishing)** - This is a recreational activity *within* a natural environment (rivers, streams).

Therefore, visiting a science museum is the only option that doesn't fit the description of natural scenery tourism.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项是交通系统的基础？,"The correct answer is **B: 私家车 (Private cars)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that everyone is ""connected to and supports a transportation system *based on private cars*."" While the other options are mentioned in the passage, they aren't the *foundation* of the system described.

* **A: 工作地点 (Workplaces)** - Workplaces are destinations, not the system itself.
* **C: 稳定的生物圈 (Stable biosphere)** - The biosphere is *threatened* by the system, not its foundation.
* **D: 人类进化发展 (Human evolution)** -  Human evolution is a historical context, not the basis of the current transportation system.



"
绕原子核运动的粒子具有哪种类型的电荷？,"The correct answer is **C: 负电**.

The text explicitly states: ""电子带有负电"" (electrons carry a negative charge).  The question asks about the charge of particles orbiting the nucleus, which are electrons.
"
原子核由哪种粒子组成？,"The correct answer is **A: 质子和中子**.

The passage explicitly states: ""原子核由中子和质子这两种粒子组成."" (The nucleus consists of two types of particles: neutrons and protons.)
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项是五位二进制数的例子？,"The correct answer is **C: 10010**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Binary numbers can *only* be 0 or 1.
* **Five-bit binary number:**  Means a number made up of exactly five digits, each of which must be either 0 or 1.

Let's look at the options:

* **A: 1010** - Only four digits.
* **B: 12001** - Contains the digit '2', which is not a binary digit.
* **C: 10010** - Contains five digits, and all digits are either 0 or 1. This is a valid five-bit binary number.
* **D: 110101** - Contains six digits.
"
二进制数字也被称为什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 位**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...这样的数被称为二进制数字，即计算机术语中的“位”."" 

Therefore, binary digits are also called ""位"" (bits).
"
以下哪项没有被提及作为学生博客的主要好处？,"The correct answer is **B: 来自同伴的批判减少 (Reduced criticism from peers)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the *opposite* of this.** It explicitly says students are often their most critical readers and that bloggers strive to improve to *avoid* criticism.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: 语法和写作水平的提高 (Improved grammar and writing skills):**  The passage directly states that readers (especially students) encourage bloggers to improve their writing and avoid mistakes.
* **C: 扩大对周遭环境的认识 (Increased awareness of the surrounding world):** The passage mentions blogging ""forces students to be more insightful"" and encourages them to be smarter and more engaging to keep their audience interested.
* **D: 增加对继续学习的渴望 (Increased desire for continued learning):** The passage states blogging ""extends learning beyond the traditional classroom"" and can make students better at analysis and critical thinking, indicating a desire for further exploration and learning.



"
以下哪个博客方面被引用作为激励学生提高写作能力的因素？,"The correct answer is **B: 渴望避免批判** (Desire to avoid criticism).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...students often are their own harshest critics, so bloggers begin to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism."" This directly links the *fear of criticism* as a motivator for better writing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 频繁回应网络材料** (Frequent response to online materials) - While the passage mentions responding to online materials helps with analysis and forming opinions, it's presented as a *result* of blogging, not a primary *motivation* for improving writing.
* **C: 保持观众的兴趣** (Maintaining audience interest) - The passage says maintaining audience interest encourages students to become ""smart and interesting,"" but it's the need to *improve writing* that comes first to *gain* and *keep* that interest.  It's a consequence, not a cause.
* **D: 对合作的需要** (Need for collaboration) - Collaboration is mentioned as a benefit of blogging, but not as a direct driver of writing improvement.



"
以下哪项不是异步通讯对学生的好处？ ,"The correct answer is **B: 可以在任何时间与老师面对面沟通 (Can communicate with the teacher face-to-face at any time)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that asynchronous communication *doesn't* require waiting for the next in-person meeting.** It allows students to submit questions and receive replies within a reasonable timeframe *instead* of waiting for a face-to-face interaction.  Asynchronous communication is *not* face-to-face.

Let's look at why the other options *are* benefits mentioned in the passage:

* **A: 使用互联网作为资源 (Using the internet as a resource):** The passage states learners can access information ""anytime"" using the internet and World Wide Web.
* **C: 弹性工作时间 (Flexible work hours):** The passage explicitly mentions ""less time constraints"" and the possibility of flexible work schedules.
* **D: 控制节奏 (Controlling the pace):** The passage states asynchronous communication allows students to learn at their own pace and control the pace of information delivery.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪个异步通讯方面对学生来说不是灵活的？,"The correct answer is **C: 教学材料**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:**
    * **Learning pace (A):** ""异步通讯让学生能够按自己的节奏学习"" (Asynchronous communication allows students to learn at their own pace).
    * **Work time (B):** ""由于可以实行弹性工作时间，时间上的限制也比较少"" (Due to the possibility of flexible working hours, there are fewer time constraints).
    * **Internet access (D):** ""学习者可以使用互联网和万维网随时获取信息"" (Learners can access information on the Internet and the World Wide Web at any time).

* **The passage does *not* mention flexibility in *teaching materials* themselves.** It focuses on the flexibility of *when* and *how* students access information and interact, not the materials' adaptability.

Therefore, the passage doesn't support the idea that the *teaching materials* are flexible through asynchronous communication."
以下哪个在文中没有被提到作为中世纪城堡可能相关的事物？,"The correct answer is **D: 骑士** (Knights).

Here's why:

* **The passage mentions:**
    * **地牢坑 (Dungeon pits):** ""也能闻到从地牢坑里冒出来的恐惧气息"" - directly referenced.
    * **马背长矛比武 (Jousting/Lance combat):** ""...让人联想到马背长矛比武..."" - directly referenced.
    * **骑士精神 (Chivalry):** ""...亚瑟王骑士精神的画面"" - directly referenced.

* **The passage does *not* specifically mention ""骑士"" (Knights) themselves.** It talks *about* knightly ideals (chivalry) but doesn't directly list knights as something associated with castles. While strongly implied, it's not explicitly stated in the text.

Therefore, **D** is the answer because it's the only option not directly mentioned within the provided passage.



"
以下哪个在文中没有被提到作为在城堡废墟中可能闻到的味道或听到的声音？,"The correct answer is **C: 宴会**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    * **战争 (War):** ""...回想起早已逝去的战争的声音..."" (""...recall the sounds of wars long past..."")
    * **恐惧 (Fear):** ""...闻到从地牢坑里冒出来的恐惧气息"" (""...smell the stench of fear rising from the dungeons..."")
    * **马蹄声 (Hooves):** ""...几乎能听到鹅卵石上马蹄的碰撞声"" (""...almost hear the clatter of hooves on the cobblestones..."")

* **宴会 (Feasts/Banquet)** is mentioned as something the castle *evokes* in the imagination (""让人联想到...宴会..."") but it is *not* stated as a smell or sound one might experience *in the ruins themselves*.

Therefore, the answer is **C**."
以下哪项是克尔比墨斯鲁城堡的准确描述？,"The correct answer is **B: 由于当时国家的和平性质，它需要最少的防御工事 (Due to the peaceful nature of the country at the time, it needed minimal defenses)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""在15世纪80年代，在黑斯廷斯勋爵开始建造这座城堡的时候，这个国家还相对和平，只需要防御一小群四处游荡的抢掠者 (In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began building the castle, the country was relatively peaceful and only needed defenses against small bands of roaming plunderers)."" This directly supports the idea that minimal defenses were required.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 这座城堡的厚墙是由黑斯廷斯勋爵要求建造的 (The castle's thick walls were requested to be built by Lord Hastings):** The passage explicitly says the walls were *thin*, not thick.
* **C: 这座城堡的建造不符合当时的典型风格 (The construction of the castle did not conform to the typical style of the time):** The passage says it *was* typical for the period - a fortified house, rather than a true castle.
* **D: 它被建造来经受长时间坚决的攻击 (It was built to withstand a long, determined attack):** The passage directly contradicts this, saying it *could not* withstand a determined attack for long.



"
在描述的时期内，以下哪项建造特征被认为是克尔比墨斯鲁城堡不寻常的？,"The correct answer is **A: 巨大的窗户 (Huge windows)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""It's large glass windows...would not withstand a determined attack for long."" This directly points to the windows being unusual for a structure built, even if a fortified house, during that period. Castles were built for defense, and large glass windows are a defensive weakness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 为抵挡攻击而建的基础 (Foundations built to withstand attack):** The passage doesn't mention anything about the foundations being unusual.
*   **C: 比一些城堡更少的防御工事 (Fewer defenses than some castles):** The passage *supports* this being true (it's described as a fortified house rather than a true castle), but it doesn't state it's *unusual* for the time. It explains *why* it has fewer defenses - the period was relatively peaceful.
*   **D: 薄墙 (Thin walls):** Similar to C, the passage states the walls were thin, but doesn't say this was *uncommon* at the time given the peaceful conditions.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项对于一名准备参加即将到来的赛季的跑步选手来说最有益？,"The correct answer is **D: 利用健身房锻炼上半身**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""在冬季练练越野跑，加上对上半身的健身锻炼，能为跑步季做好充分准备。"" (Winter cross-country running, combined with upper body fitness training, can fully prepare for the running season.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 在夏天练习越野跑 (Summer cross-country running):** The passage recommends cross-country running in the *winter*, not summer.
* **B: 专注于培养速度而进行训练 (Focusing on training to develop speed):** While the passage acknowledges speed is *necessary* for elite half-mile runners, it emphasizes that *endurance* becomes more crucial at that distance.  It's not the primary focus.
* **C: 在三分钟内跑完 (Finishing in under three minutes):** The passage mentions a goal of finishing in *under two minutes* for elite runners, not three.  This is a distractor.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项对于一名一流的半英里跑步选手来说最为重要？,"The correct answer is **B: 培养耐力而非速度**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""从四分之一英里转变为半英里的赛跑，速度变得不那么重要了，耐力成为绝对重要的因素."" (As the race changes from a quarter mile to a half mile, speed becomes less important and endurance becomes the absolutely crucial factor.)
* While speed *is* mentioned as necessary (""就必须要有足够快的速度""), the text clearly emphasizes that endurance is the *most* important factor for a successful half-mile runner.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 在冬季练习越野跑 (Practicing cross-country running in winter)** - This is presented as *preparation* for the season, not the most important thing itself.
* **C: 在两分钟内跑完 (Finishing in under two minutes)** - This is a *result* of being a good runner, not the key characteristic that makes a runner good.
* **D: 培养速度而非耐力 (Developing speed rather than endurance)** - This is directly contradicted by the passage.



"
对于一名运动员，以下哪项不可能仅靠营养实践来实现？,"The correct answer is **C: 出色表现 (Outstanding performance)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""仅靠适当的营养实践并不足以造就出色表现"" (Relying on proper nutrition practices alone is not enough to achieve outstanding performance). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 改善表现 (Improve performance):** The passage says nutrition *can* help improve performance.
* **B: 增加乐趣 (Increase enjoyment):** The passage states nutrition can increase enjoyment.
* **D: 整体健康状况 (Overall health):** The passage says nutrition *significantly* impacts overall health.

Therefore, only ""出色表现"" is stated as something nutrition *cannot* achieve alone.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不是年轻运动员在运动中寻找更多乐趣的建议？,"The correct answer is **B: 一直保持出色表现 (Always maintaining excellent performance)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that proper nutrition can *help* improve performance and *increase enjoyment*. It doesn't say that achieving excellent performance *is* the way to find more fun. In fact, it implies that enjoyment comes *alongside* improved health and potentially performance through good nutrition.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: 实践适当的营养 (Practicing proper nutrition)** - The text explicitly states this helps improve performance and increase enjoyment.
*   **C: 有效补充水分 (Effective hydration)** - The passage specifically mentions ""effective hydration"" as a way to help athletes.
*   **D: 保持健康的能量平衡 (Maintaining a healthy energy balance)** - The text highlights ""maintaining a healthy energy balance"" as beneficial.

Therefore, the only option *not* directly mentioned as contributing to enjoyment is consistently achieving high levels of performance."
根据这段文字，为什么一名中长跑参与者可能会购买更昂贵的装备？,"The correct answer is **A: 这是他们个人的偏好 (This is their personal preference)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""运动员可能会认为他们倾向于一个产品，尽管这个产品毫无益处。"" This directly supports the idea that athletes might choose a more expensive item simply because they *feel* it's better for them, even if there's no actual performance benefit.  It's a matter of personal preference.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 这已经被证明有益 (This has been proven beneficial):** The passage explicitly says most equipment has *almost no actual impact* on performance.
* **C: 这会极大地影响他们的表现 (This will greatly affect their performance):** The passage states the opposite - there's little to no actual impact.
* **D: 围绕相对低廉的装备存在误解 (There are misunderstandings about relatively inexpensive equipment):** While the passage *mentions* misunderstandings about equipment, it doesn't say this is the *reason* someone would buy expensive gear.  It explains *why* misunderstandings exist, not why someone would spend more money.



"
根据这段文字，中长跑需要什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 很少的装备** (Few equipment).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""中长跑是一项花费相对低廉的运动"" (Long-distance running is a relatively inexpensive sport). This directly implies it doesn't require a lot of equipment.
* **The passage continues:** It explains that while equipment *can* be bought, most of it doesn't actually improve performance. This reinforces the idea that it's not a sport dependent on expensive or numerous items.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 大量的装备** (A lot of equipment) - This is the opposite of what the passage says.
* **B: 成熟的运动背景** (Mature sports background) - The passage doesn't mention anything about needing prior athletic experience.
* **D: 大量的金钱** (A lot of money) - The passage explicitly says it's a *low-cost* sport.



"
是谁发现了核磁共振？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 布洛赫和珀塞耳 (Bloch and Purcell)**.

The text states: ""核磁共振 (NMR) 的物理现象，它是费利克斯·布洛赫（在斯坦福大学工作）和爱德华·珀塞耳（来自哈佛大学）于 20 世纪 30 年代发现的。"" (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), a physical phenomenon, was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University).)

While Damadian was crucial in applying NMR to medical imaging, he *didn't* discover NMR itself.
"
第一个医学成像共振专利是在哪一年获得的？ ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The passage states: ""1974, a patent was approved, which was the first in the world to be granted in the field of NMR."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 1977** - This is when Damadian completed the first ""whole-body"" scanner, not when the patent was granted.
*   **C: 1930** - This is when Bloch and Purcell *discovered* NMR, not when a medical imaging patent was granted.
*   **D: 1970** - This is when Damadian discovered the principle for using MRI as a diagnostic tool, but the patent was not granted until later."
根据这段文字，为了解释他人的身体行为，人类应该对什么有很强的理解？,"The correct answer is **B: 意图 (Intentions)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""在这些能力中，理解他人意图至关重要。(Among these abilities, understanding others' intentions is crucial.)""
* **The example provided** demonstrates how understanding *why* someone breaks a car window (their intention - stealing vs. unlocking) drastically changes the interpretation of the action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 欲望 (Desires):** While desires play a role in intentions, the passage focuses specifically on understanding the *purpose* behind an action, not just what someone wants.
* **C: 信仰 (Beliefs):** Beliefs can influence intentions, but aren't the direct thing we need to understand to interpret behavior.
* **D: 感知 (Perceptions):** Perception is how someone *views* the world, not what they are *trying to do* in it.



"
根据这段文字，理解意图有助于人类做什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 消除身体行为背后的不确定性**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""我们可以凭借这一能力理解身体行为可能表达出的模棱两可的问题."" (We can use this ability to understand the ambiguities that physical behavior can express.)  The example of breaking a car window illustrates this – the *intention* behind the action (stealing vs. unlocking) clarifies the meaning of the ambiguous behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 预测欲望 (Predict desires):** While understanding intention *can* help infer desires, the passage focuses on clarifying *actions* first, not directly predicting desires.
* **C: 不带偏见地看待其他人 (View others without bias):** The passage doesn't discuss bias; it's about accurately interpreting actions, not eliminating prejudice.
* **D: 读懂他人的心理 (Read others' minds):** The passage states humans are good at understanding others' minds *generally*, but specifically highlights intention as key to understanding ambiguous *behavior*. It's a component of mind-reading, but not the whole thing.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项是 AI 主要目的的准确概括？,"The correct answer is **D: 任务自动化**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""人工智能 (AI) 的研究涉及制造机器让**需要智能行为的任务自动化**.""  This is the overarching goal described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 规划** - Planning is *an example* of a task AI can handle, but not the main purpose.
*   **B: 声音识别** - Voice recognition is also *an example* of an AI capability, not the core goal.
*   **C: 调度** - Like the above, scheduling is an application of AI, not its defining objective.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项常常与 AI 相关联？,"The correct answer is **C: 科幻小说**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""人工智能有很强的科幻色彩..."" (Artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction flavor...).

While options A, B, and D are *examples* of things AI does (as listed in the text), the passage *starts* by linking AI to science fiction.  The question asks what is *commonly associated* with AI, and the text directly establishes that association with science fiction.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项是具有收敛思维模式的人的优点？,"The correct answer is **D: 记忆模式**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""这种思维类型的人具有逻辑思维，能够记得住模式、解决问题，还能进行科学测试。"" (This type of thinker has logical thinking, can remember patterns, solve problems, and conduct scientific tests.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 甄别问题的多个正确答案 (Identifying multiple correct answers to a problem)** - The passage states there's *only one* correct answer with convergent thinking.
*   **B: 将新技术应用到问题上 (Applying new technologies to problems)** - The passage mentions ""对现有技术的重新应用"" (reapplication of existing technology), not new technology.
*   **C: 花时间解决问题 (Taking time to solve problems)** - The passage emphasizes *speed* and *accuracy*, implying efficiency, not necessarily taking a long time.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不被认为是收敛思维模式的关注点？,"The correct answer is **B: 慢慢来**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that convergent thinking values **speed**, logic, and accuracy. ""慢慢来"" (slowly) is the opposite of speed and therefore not a focus of convergent thinking.

The passage *does* mention:

*   **A: 理解正确答案只有一个** - It emphasizes ""correct answer only one.""
*   **C: 甄别事实** - It lists ""identifying facts"" as a characteristic.
*   **D: 收集信息** - It lists ""information gathering"" as a characteristic.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不被认为是微表情？,"The correct answer is **D: 竖起大拇指**.

Here's why:

* **The passage defines microexpressions as ""fleeting facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.""** This implies very quick, subtle changes in facial expression.
* **A: 说话时看向别处 (Looking away while speaking)** - While not a *facial* expression, it's a body language cue that could accompany a microexpression or indicate deception.
* **B: 皱眉 (Frowning)** - Is a facial expression, and can be a microexpression if it's very brief.
* **C: 快速眨眼 (Rapid blinking)** - Can be a subtle and fast facial movement, fitting the definition of a microexpression.
* **D: 竖起大拇指 (Giving a thumbs up)** - This is a deliberate, sustained gesture - it's *not* a fleeting, milliseconds-long facial movement. It's a clear, intentional signal, not a microexpression.

Therefore, the passage would *not* consider a thumbs up to be a microexpression."
以下哪个有关微表情解读的陈述不正确？,"The correct answer is **C: 语言和面部表情都被解读**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that people *with* brain damage who cannot understand language *can still* accurately judge sincerity.** This means sincerity is being judged *without* understanding language. The passage focuses on interpreting *facial* expressions (microexpressions specifically) to determine truthfulness, not on interpreting language *alongside* facial expressions.

Let's look at why the other options are correct and supported by the text:

* **A: 录像带来了重大进展 (Recording has brought significant progress)** - The passage begins by stating that recording has led to major discoveries in understanding microexpressions.
* **B: 正确解读可判断是否撒谎 (Correct interpretation can determine if someone is lying)** - The passage explicitly states microexpressions can be used to judge whether someone is lying.
* **D: 它可以帮助判断诚意 (It can help judge sincerity)** - Oliver Sacks' example demonstrates that people can assess sincerity through expressions, even without understanding language.



"
文艺复兴后，以下哪项变得更加重要？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 文本回忆 (Recalling texts)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""压力不再存在于个人回忆中，但回忆文本的能力变得更加重要 (Pressure is no longer on individual recall, but the ability to recall texts becomes more important)."" 

This directly supports the idea that, after the changes brought about by the Renaissance, remembering *where* information was found (in texts) was more crucial than simply memorizing facts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 个人回忆 (Individual recall):** The passage explicitly says this became *less* important.
*   **B: 传播知识 (Disseminating knowledge):** While the Renaissance *changed* how knowledge was spread, the passage doesn't say spreading knowledge itself became more important; it focuses on the *method* of engaging with knowledge.
*   **D: 获取信息 (Acquiring information):**  The passage says the *rate* of acquiring knowledge changed, but doesn’t state that acquiring information itself became more important.



"
作为文艺复兴的结果，以下哪个得到的重视减少了？,"The correct answer is **A: 个人回忆 (Personal recall)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""压力不再存在于个人回忆中，但回忆文本的能力变得更加重要。"" (Pressure is no longer on personal recall, but the ability to recall text becomes more important.) This directly indicates that the emphasis shifted *away* from memorizing information personally and *towards* being able to find and remember information within texts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 获取知识 (Acquiring knowledge):** The passage states knowledge acquisition *changes*, not diminishes.
* **C: 文本回忆 (Text recall):** The passage specifically says text recall becomes *more* important.
* **D: 信息传播 (Information dissemination):** The passage states the Renaissance significantly changed *how* knowledge was spread, but doesn't say it was reduced in importance.



"
以下哪个不反映使用互联网维持人际关系的动机？,"The correct answer is **C: Research travel**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on motivations related to *communication and relationships*.** It specifically mentions ""交际"" (socializing/interaction), ""个人参与"" (personal engagement), and ""持续的关系"" (ongoing relationships).
* **A: 商业社交 (Business networking)** is about building and maintaining *professional* relationships - a form of interpersonal connection.
* **B: 与家人保持联系 (Staying in touch with family)** is a direct example of maintaining existing interpersonal relationships.
* **D: 认识新人 (Meeting new people)** is about *forming* new interpersonal relationships.
* **C: 研究旅行 (Researching travel)** is primarily an informational activity. While you *might* discuss travel plans with others, the act of research itself isn't inherently about *maintaining* interpersonal relationships. It's about gathering information for a personal goal.

Therefore, researching travel doesn't fit the theme of using the internet to *sustain* relationships as the other options do.



"
以下哪项不反映出使用互联网进行个人参与的动机？,"The correct answer is **C: 研究医疗保健产品**.

Here's why:

* **Personal engagement**, as highlighted in the passage, refers to building relationships and actively participating with others.

Let's break down each option:

* **A: 查找食谱 (Finding recipes)** - While helpful, this is generally a solitary activity focused on information gathering. It doesn't inherently involve interaction with others.
* **B: 在线上讨论板上发帖 (Posting on online forums)** - This *directly* reflects personal engagement. You're sharing your thoughts, interacting with others, and building a community.
* **D: 管理财务 (Managing finances)** -  This is a practical, personal task, but doesn't necessarily require *interaction* or engagement with other people. It's often a solo activity.
* **C: 研究医疗保健产品 (Researching healthcare products)** - Similar to finding recipes, this is primarily information gathering. While you might *eventually* discuss options with a doctor, the research itself isn't an inherently social or interactive activity that fosters ""personal engagement.""

The passage emphasizes the *social* aspect of new motivations for internet use.  Researching healthcare products is about obtaining information, not necessarily *engaging* with others.



"
西欧何时停止严重依赖影响并开始发展自己的风格？,"The correct answer is **A: 大约在中世纪末期 (Approximately towards the end of the Middle Ages)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""随着中世纪走向末期，西欧人民逐渐发展出自己的风格 (As the Middle Ages drew to a close, the people of Western Europe gradually developed their own style).""  This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 拜占庭时代 (Byzantine Era):** The passage states that early Gothic styles *were influenced* by Byzantine culture, not that Western Europe stopped relying on it during that time.
* **C: 中世纪后 25 年左右 (Around 25 years after the Middle Ages):** The passage says fashion *lagged* by 25-30 years, not that independent style developed that long *after* the Middle Ages.
* **D: 11 世纪期间 (During the 11th century):** The passage states that the initial styles were heavily influenced by the Byzantine Empire during the 10-11th centuries, meaning they *hadn't* yet begun to develop their own style.



"
使用纽扣系衣服是什么的结果？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 十字军东征 (The Crusades)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...one of the biggest advances at the time was the use of buttons to fasten clothing *after* the Crusades.""  Therefore, using buttons was a *result* of the Crusades.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 哥特时期 (Gothic Period):** The Gothic period *is* when buttons became popular, but it's not the *cause* of the button use.
*   **B: 拜占庭时代 (Byzantine Era):** The passage states Gothic fashion was *initially* influenced by Byzantium, but doesn't connect it to the use of buttons.
*   **D: 中世纪 (Middle Ages):** This is too broad. The Crusades were a specific event *within* the Middle Ages that led to the change.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项被认为是解决环境问题的可行长期方案？,"The correct answer is **C: 找到问题的根源**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""但是，如果我们不仅仅想要一个临时的解决方案的话，那么我们就应该找到问题的根源，并把它彻底根除。""  The author contrasts temporary fixes (like joining movements or being activists - options B & D) with addressing the *root cause* of the problem. While reducing luxury (A) is mentioned as *exacerbating* the issue, finding the root cause is presented as the true long-term solution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 抵制奢侈的生活方式选择 (Resisting luxurious lifestyle choices)** - The passage states luxury *worsens* the problem, but doesn't present it as the solution itself.
* **B: 成为积极分子 (Becoming an activist)** - The passage compares this to ""treating symptoms"" – a temporary fix.
* **D: 加入环保运动 (Joining environmental movements)** -  Also considered a symptomatic treatment, not a root cause solution.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪种解决方案不会被认为是环境问题的症状疗法？,"The correct answer is **B: 消除问题的根源**.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly contrasts ""symptom treatment"" with addressing the ""root cause"" of problems.** It states that if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to find and eliminate the root cause.
* **Options A, C, and D are all described as actions that are similar to symptom treatment.** They address the *effects* of the problem (pollution, environmental damage) but don't tackle the underlying issues of overpopulation and unsustainable lifestyles.
* **Option B is the one action described as going beyond symptom treatment.** It's the action of finding and dealing with the root of the problem.

Therefore, eliminating the root cause is the solution the passage would *not* consider a symptom treatment."
在哪个国家发生了欧洲第一场核心问题与宗教背景无关，而是与权力的平衡有关的战争？,"The passage states that the **Spanish Inheritance War** marked the first war centered around the balance of power. Therefore, the answer is **D: Spain**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically identifies the Spanish Inheritance War as the first war where the core issue was the balance of power, not religion.
* The other options are not mentioned in relation to this shift in warfare.



"
哪场战争有时被描述为最后一场“宗教战争”？,"The correct answer is **A: 三十年战争**.

The passage explicitly states: ""因此，三十年战争将是最后一场被贴上宗教战争标签的战争。"" (Therefore, the Thirty Years' War would be the last war to be labelled as a religious war.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 百年战争 (Hundred Years' War):** This war predates the shift away from religious justifications for war described in the passage.
*   **C: 西班牙王位继承权之战 (War of the Spanish Succession):** The passage states this war *marked* the change, making power balance the core issue, *leading* to the Thirty Years' War being the last religious war.
*   **D: 西班牙内战 (Spanish Civil War):** This war occurred much later and wasn't a central conflict in establishing the power balance system.



"
以下天主教会的哪个方面没有受到密切监督？,"The correct answer is **B: 宗教的主要信条是否应该修改**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the Church was under close scrutiny.** It specifically mentions scrutiny regarding whether they *followed* their beliefs about wealth and poverty (D), the concentration of power (C), and implicitly, how wealth was distributed (A) given the questioning of whether they lived up to their beliefs.
* **The passage *doesn't* suggest anyone was questioning the core beliefs themselves.**  It focuses on whether the Church was *acting* in accordance with those beliefs, not whether the beliefs were wrong or needed changing.

Therefore, the aspect of the Catholic Church *not* under close scrutiny, based on the passage, is whether its main tenets should be modified.



"
根据这段文字，在凡尔赛宫谁被杀害了？,"The correct answer is **D: 一名卫士**.

The text states: ""当着吓坏了的女王的面，有一名暴徒一度挥动一颗皇家卫士的头颅，这名卫士是在凡尔赛宫被杀害的。"" (In front of the terrified queen, a rioter once waved the head of a royal guard who had been killed at the Palace of Versailles.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 一名集市妇女** - The text says the women *led* the march, but doesn't say one was killed.
*   **B: 国王路易十六** - The king was forced to return to Paris, but wasn't killed.
*   **C: 一名暴徒** - A rioter *waved* a head, but wasn't the one killed.



"
以下哪项不是由暴民强加于国王和王后的？,"The correct answer is **B: 立即离开凡尔赛宫**.

Here's why:

* **A: 打开他们的马车窗户** - The passage specifically states the mob *forced* them to open the windows.
* **C: 观看警卫的斩首** - The passage states a head was waved in front of the Queen, forcing her to witness it.
* **D: 返回巴黎的行程** - The passage states they were *driven* back to Paris by the mob.

However, the mob didn't *force* them to leave Versailles initially. They were already at Versailles, and the mob escorted (or rather, drove) them *from* Versailles *to* Paris. Leaving Versailles wasn't something the mob *made* them do in the same way as the other options; it was the result of the mob's actions.



"
以下哪项不是英国非传统海战的结果？,"The correct answer is **C: 对国际法进行了修改**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the blockade *violated* existing international law.** It didn't *change* it. The lack of strong response from other nations allowed the UK to continue despite the violations, but the law itself wasn't altered.

Let's look at why the other options *are* results of the British naval warfare:

* **A: 德国希望采用类似的战术 (Germany hoped to adopt similar tactics):** The passage explicitly says Germany expected its unrestricted submarine warfare to receive a similar lack of response as the British blockade.
* **B: 无关的船只置身危险之中 (Irrelevant ships were put in danger):**  The passage states the British laid mines in international waters, threatening even neutral ships.
* **D: 关键供应物资无法获得 (Critical supplies were unavailable):** The blockade *purposefully* cut off vital military and civilian supplies to Germany.

Therefore, modifying international law is the only option that didn't happen as a result of the British actions described.



"
以下哪项陈述没有准确描述英国对德国的海上封锁？,"The correct answer is **D: 确保中立船只不会受到威胁**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""英国在国际水域布雷，防止任何船只进入整片海域，**甚至对中立国船只也构成威胁**。"" (Britain laid mines in international waters, preventing any ships from entering the entire sea area, **even threatening neutral ships**.)

Therefore, the statement that the blockade *ensured* neutral ships weren't threatened is inaccurate – quite the opposite is true.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: 违反了国际法 (Violated international law):** The passage states the blockade ""违反了在过去的两个世纪里，根据几项国际协定制定的已为大家普遍接受的国际法"" (violated international law established over the past two centuries by several international treaties).
* **B: 促使了德国的潜艇战 (Led to German submarine warfare):** The passage states Germany ""期望其无限制潜艇战也能有类似的响应"" (expected its unrestricted submarine warfare to have a similar response) to the blockade.
* **C: 切断了德国供应的流通 (Cut off the flow of German supplies):** The passage states Britain ""切断了生死攸关的军事和民用物资供应"" (cut off vital military and civilian supplies).



"
根据这段文字，谁最可能被诊断出患有多发性硬化症？,"The correct answer is **A: 一个 32 岁的女性 (A 32-year-old woman)**.

Here's why:

* **Age:** The passage states MS is a disease of *young to middle-aged* adults. 32 falls within this range.
* **Gender:** The passage explicitly states women are *twice as likely* to develop MS as men.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: 一个 15 岁的男孩 (A 15-year-old boy):** MS is less common in children.
* **C: 一个 43 岁的男性 (A 43-year-old man):** While within the age range, men are less likely than women.
* **D: 一个 10 岁的女孩 (A 10-year-old girl):**  MS is very rare in young children.



"
根据这段文字，参与定期训练的人在哪方面需要更多的支持？,"The correct answer is **A: 对疼痛的被动感知** (Passive perception of pain).

The text specifically states: ""参与定期训练的人在对疼痛的被动感知方面需要更多支持，以帮助他们区分慢性疼痛和不适感与正常身体运动的区别。"" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 腰部** - The text discusses back pain generally, but doesn't say people need more support *for their back*.
* **C: 沮丧** - The text says depression mediates pain and disability, but doesn't indicate people *in training* need support for it.
* **D: 恐惧** - Similar to depression, fear is a mediator but not a specific area of support needed *by those training*.



"
根据这段文字，击剑通常是以什么方式进行的？,"The correct answer is **D: 以对决形式 (in a duel form)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""这项运动主要以对决的形式进行，也就是一个击剑手与另一个击剑手进行对决。"" (This sport is mainly conducted in the form of a duel, that is, a fencing athlete against another fencing athlete).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 以现代形式 (in a modern form)** - While true, the passage focuses *how* it's played, not *that* it's modern.
*   **B: 在大学级别 (at the university level)** - The passage mentions university level as a starting point, not the typical way it's done.
*   **C: 在奥林匹克级别 (at the Olympic level)** - The passage mentions the Olympic level as a professional endpoint, not the standard format."
根据这段文字，以下哪项是体内中毒的最有力指示物？,"The correct answer is **D: 处方药瓶 (prescription bottle)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""摄入毒物的最有力指示物可能是现场被打开的容器，里面装有药物或家用有毒化学品。"" (The most powerful indicator of poisoning might be an opened container found at the scene with medicine or household toxic chemicals.)

Options A, B, and C describe *symptoms* of poisoning, but the passage specifically says these symptoms are common and *don't* allow for immediate diagnosis. It identifies the *opened container* as the strongest indicator.
"
根据这段文字，检查受害者时应该采取的适当的第一步是什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 勘察现场** (Investigate the scene).

The text explicitly states: ""To check the victim, you must **first investigate the scene** and ensure your own safety."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 靠近受害者** (Approach the victim) - The text says you approach *after* ensuring safety by investigating the scene.
* **C: 检查受害者的姿势** (Check the victim's posture) - This is something you do *while* approaching, not the first step.
* **D: 等待帮助** (Wait for help) - The text implies taking action, not waiting.



"
以下哪种陈述没有准确反映检查受害者的过程？,"The correct answer is **A: 不用担心自己受伤 (Don't worry about getting injured)**.

Here's why:

* **P explicitly states:** ""If you want to help someone and get injured, you will only make things worse."" This directly contradicts the idea of *not* worrying about your own safety.  Prioritizing your own safety is the *first* step mentioned.

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurate reflections of the text:

* **B: 先勘察现场再检查受害者 (Survey the scene before checking the victim)** - This is the very first thing P says you must do.
* **C: 观察受害者的姿势 (Observe the victim's posture)** - P states you need to pay attention to the victim’s posture when approaching.
* **D: 尽可能注意任何危险信号 (Pay attention to any danger signals as much as possible)** - P specifically mentions being aware of ""any unconscious danger signals.""



"
在法国大革命中，哪项变革对工人阶级公民产生了重大影响？,"The correct answer is **B: 重点从阶级转移到能力 (Focus shifted from class to ability)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""官职面向全体男性开放申请，这使得最有抱负、最成功之人有机会飞黄腾达...军队亦然，因为军衔的高低不再基于等级，而是基于才干。""  This directly describes a shift away from social class/birthright and towards ability/merit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 对国家的支持增加了 (Increased support for the nation):** While nationalism was *a* result of the revolution (mentioned in the passage), the passage doesn't highlight this as a direct impact *on the worker class*.
* **C: 采用了共和制思想 (Adoption of republican ideas):**  The passage mentions the shift from monarchy to republic, but doesn't connect this *specifically* to improving the situation of the worker class. It's a political change, but not necessarily one that directly benefited workers.
* **D: 新的度量单位 (New units of measurement):**  The passage mentions new units of measurement, but this is presented as a general societal impact, not one focused on the worker class.



"
随着法国大革命的发生，军事和其他职业的成功更不太可能基于哪些因素？,"The correct answer is **B: 阶级 (Class)**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""军队亦然，因为军衔的高低不再基于等级，而是基于才干"" (and similarly for official positions).  ""等级"" directly refers to class/social standing.  The revolution aimed to dismantle the old system where birth and social class determined success in the military and government.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 成就 (Achievement)** - The passage states that success was open to those who were ""most ambitious and successful,"" implying achievement *was* important.
*   **C: 野心 (Ambition)** -  The passage explicitly mentions ""most ambitious"" people having opportunities.
*   **D: 才干 (Talent/Ability)** - The passage states military rank was now based on ""才干"" (talent/ability).



"
据说在发达国家中哪种公共服务引起的怨言最为严重？,"The correct answer is **C: 公共交通**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""几乎每个人都对交通系统有怨言"" (Almost everyone complains about the transportation system). It then contrasts this with a lack of similar complaints about water quality or bridge collapses. This directly points to transportation/public transit being the most complained about public service.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 水质 (Water quality):** The passage says complaints are *less* frequent about water quality.
*   **B: 桥梁建设 (Bridge construction):**  Similarly, complaints are less frequent about bridge construction.
*   **D: 教育 (Education):** The passage doesn't mention education at all.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪种关于公共交通系统的说法是正确的？,"The correct answer is **C: 使用的人有很多怨言 (People have many complaints)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""几乎每个人都对交通系统有怨言"" (Almost everyone has complaints about the transportation system).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 每个使用的人都非常喜欢 (Everyone who uses it really likes it)** - The passage says the *opposite*.
*   **B: 不像水质那样糟糕 (Not as bad as water quality)** - While the passage *compares* complaints about transportation to those about water quality/bridges, it doesn't say transportation is *better* than water quality; just that people complain about it to a similar extent.
*   **D: 在大多数发达国家是免费的 (It's free in most developed countries)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about cost.



"
根据这段文字，由于驾驶员的不可预测性，以下哪个因素可能会很难衡量？,"The correct answer is **D: 交通流量 (Traffic flow)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.""  Traffic flow *is* the study of drivers and vehicles in motion.  The unpredictability of drivers directly impacts the ability to accurately measure traffic flow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 交通速度 (Traffic speed):** While driver behavior influences speed, the passage implies speed *can* be represented mathematically as part of the relationship with flow and density.
* **B: 道路规划 (Road planning):** The passage says understanding flow, density, and speed *helps* with road planning – it doesn't say planning is difficult to measure.
* **C: 道路运营 (Road operation):**  Similar to planning, the passage states understanding these factors aids in road operation, not that operation itself is difficult to measure.

Therefore, the passage directly links the difficulty of studying traffic flow to the unpredictability of drivers.



"
在用数学方式表示交通流量时，使用以下哪个因素？,"The correct answer is **D: 交通密度 (Traffic density)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""为了更好地表示交通流量，在以下三个主要特征之间建立了关系：(1) 流量、(2) 密度和 (3) 速度。"" (To better represent traffic flow, a relationship was established between the following three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 道路运营 (Road operation)** - While the passage states the relationships are *helpful* for road operation, operation itself isn't a *factor used in the mathematical representation*.
* **B: 驾驶员行为 (Driver behavior)** - The passage acknowledges driver behavior is unpredictable and the *reason* mathematical modeling is difficult, but it's not *used* in the model itself. The model relies on the *consistency* of that behavior, not the behavior itself.
* **C: 道路设计 (Road design)** - Similar to road operation, the relationships are useful *for* road design, but aren't factors *in* the mathematical representation.



"
赫希及崔斯用什么来植入他们的 DNA？ ,"The correct answer is **D: 病毒**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""赫尔希和蔡斯利用噬菌体或病毒，将他们自己的 DNA 植入到细菌之中."" This directly answers the question of what they used to deliver the DNA.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 放射性磷 (Radioactive phosphorus)** - Radioactive phosphorus was used to *mark* the DNA, not to deliver it.
*   **B: 遗传物质 (Genetic material)** - This is what they were *studying*, not the tool they used to get it inside the bacteria.
*   **C: 放射性硫 (Radioactive sulfur)** - Radioactive sulfur was used to mark the *protein*, not deliver the DNA.



"
一个突变能否遗传给后代取决于什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 细胞是否为生殖系 (Whether the cell is a germline cell)**.

Here's why:

The passage *specifically* states: ""Only mutations in germline cells are passed on to children..."" This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 遗传物质的重要性 (The importance of the affected genetic material):** While importance affects the *impact* of a mutation, it doesn't determine if it's *inherited*.
* **C: 突变的类型 (The type of mutation):**  The type affects the *impact*, not inheritable status.
* **D: 突变是否会导致细胞死亡 (Whether the mutation leads to cell death):** Mutations that cause cell death are *not* inherited; the passage contrasts these with mutations passed on through germline cells.



"
根据文中提供的信息，突变的各种影响不依赖于以下哪些因素？,"The correct answer is **A: 受影响遗传物质的数量 (The amount of genetic material affected)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states mutations depend on:**
    * **Type of mutation (D)**
    * **Importance of the affected genetic material (C)**
    * **Whether the affected cells are germline (reproductive) cells (B)**

* **The passage *doesn't* mention the *quantity* of genetic material affected as a determining factor.**  It focuses on *what* genetic material is affected and *where* (germline vs. other cells), not *how much*.

Therefore, the amount of affected genetic material is the factor the passage does *not* say influences the effects of a mutation.
"
以下哪项不是古代文明驯养山羊的原因？,"The correct answer is **C: 它们提供了陪伴**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ancient civilizations and tribes began to domesticate them for their milk, meat, hair, and hides."" This covers options A, B (implied by using the land for grazing), and D.
* **The passage does *not* mention companionship** as a reason for domesticating goats. While people may have become fond of their goats, the primary reasons were utilitarian (for resources).

Therefore, option C is the one thing *not* listed as a reason for ancient civilizations to tame goats."
高尔夫的目标是获得最少的什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 击球次数** (strokes).

The passage states: ""以最少击球次数或挥棒次数完成比赛的选手获胜。"" which translates to ""The player who completes the game with the fewest strokes wins."" 

While the ultimate goal is to finish all the holes, the *way* to win is by using the fewest strokes.
"
高尔夫球场上，哪里的草被修剪得更短？,"The correct answer is **B: 在果岭 (In the green)**.

The passage specifically states: ""比赛是在草地上进行的，洞周围的草被修剪得更短，被称为果岭。"" (The game is played on grass, and the grass around the holes is cut shorter, called the green.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 在第十八洞 (In the 18th hole):** While the game *ends* at the 18th hole, the passage doesn't say the grass there is specifically shorter.
* **C: 在第一洞 (In the 1st hole):**  The passage doesn't mention anything special about the grass at the first hole.
* **D: 在球场的前半段 (In the first half of the course):** The passage doesn't divide the course into sections or specify shorter grass in the first half.



"
实验的典型目的是什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 消除一个或多个可能性假设**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""实验是一种用来**消除一个或多个可能性假设**的试验..."" This directly answers the question about the typical purpose of an experiment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 找出世界的运行方式** - This is the overall goal of *science* as a whole, not specifically the purpose of an *experiment*.
* **C: 提出问题** -  While important to science, posing questions isn't the *purpose* of an experiment, but often what *leads* to one.
* **D: 指导科学研究** - The *scientific method* guides research, not experiments themselves. Experiments are a *part* of that method.



"
根据这段文字，哪个选项不能帮助指导科学研究？,"The correct answer is **A: 只用科学方法 (Only use the scientific method)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the scientific method *guides* research, but isn't the *only* guidance. It specifically mentions observation *also* guides scientific research. The passage doesn't say research *requires* exclusively the scientific method.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: 进行观察 (Conducting observations)** - The passage explicitly states ""提出问题及进行观察也可以指导科学研究"" (Asking questions and making observations can also guide scientific research).
* **C: 消除可能性假设 (Eliminating possible hypotheses)** - The passage states that experiments are used to ""消除一个或多个可能性假设"" (eliminate one or more possible hypotheses).
* **D: 进行实验 (Conducting experiments)** - The passage explicitly states that experiments are a way to guide scientific research.

Therefore, relying *only* on the scientific method isn't supported by the text as being necessary for guiding research. It's one tool, but not the *only* one.



"
根据这段文字，下列关于龙卷风的哪项描述不正确？,"The correct answer is **C: 大多数龙卷风持续时间超过三小时**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""龙卷风中的百分之二最为猛烈，能持续肆虐三小时以上."" (Only two percent of the most violent tornadoes last more than three hours.) This means the *vast majority* of tornadoes do *not* last three hours or more.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: 龙卷风可以摧毁其周围的一切** - The text says ""可以摧毁途经的一切"" (can destroy everything in its path).
* **B: 龙卷风袭击的区域比其他风暴小** - The text starts with ""与其他猛烈的风暴相比，龙卷风袭击的区域较小"" (Compared to other severe storms, tornadoes affect a smaller area).
* **D: 有些龙卷风的风速可以达到 300 英里每小时** - The text states ""风速高达每小时 480 公里（133 m/s; 300 mph）"" (winds can reach speeds of up to 300 mph).



"
根据这段文字，下列哪项陈述准确描述了大多数龙卷风？,"The correct answer is **D: 它们能将树木连根拔起**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""龙卷风能将树木连根拔起，将建筑物上的木板撕下，把汽车抛向天空."" (Tornadoes can uproot trees, tear siding off buildings, and throw cars into the air.)  This directly describes what *most* tornadoes do.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 它们通常持续三小时以上 (They typically last more than three hours):** The passage says *the most intense 2%* of tornadoes last that long, not most.
* **B: 它们创造出大约每小时 480 英里的风速 (They create wind speeds of around 480 miles per hour):** This is only true for the *most intense* tornadoes.
* **C: 它们影响的区域比其他风暴更大 (They affect a larger area than other storms):** The passage explicitly states the opposite: ""与其他猛烈的风暴相比，龙卷风袭击的区域较小"" (Compared to other severe storms, tornadoes affect a smaller area).



"
在 16 世纪，人类开始进行以下哪项？,"The correct answer is **D: 制造望远镜 (manufacturing telescopes)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""The first true telescopes were made in Europe in the late 16th century.""  The question asks what humans *began* to do in the 16th century.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 使用透镜 (using lenses):**  The passage states humans have been making *and using* magnifying glasses for thousands of years, so using lenses wasn't new to the 16th century.
* **B: 放大物体 (magnifying objects):** Similar to A, magnifying glasses existed long before the 16th century.
* **C: 制造透镜 (manufacturing lenses):**  Making lenses was also a prerequisite to making magnifying glasses, therefore it wasn't something that *started* in the 16th century.



"
人类使用透镜放大物体有多长时间？,"The correct answer is **C: 几千年**.

The passage states: ""For thousands of years, humans have been making and using magnifying glasses."" A magnifying glass *is* a lens used to make things appear larger.  Therefore, humans have been using lenses to magnify objects for thousands of years.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 一千年** (One thousand years) - While possible, the passage specifically says ""thousands of years,"" making ""几千年"" a more accurate translation.
*   **B: 自 16 世纪晚期以来** (Since the late 16th century) - This is when *telescopes* were invented, not when lenses were first used for magnification.
*   **D: 自 16 世纪早期以来** (Since the early 16th century) - Similar to B, this refers to the invention of telescopes, not the general use of lenses for magnification."
根据这段文字，穆罕默德的洞穴对他的精神修行或价值观有何启示？,"The correct answer is **A: He valued peace and isolation.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** Muhammad went to the cave to *meditate* and it was a place of *complete isolation* from the world.  It describes how nothing could be seen or heard from the outside world within the cave. This all points to a desire for peace and solitude for spiritual pursuits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 外界的噪音有助于冥想 (External noise aids meditation):** The text says the opposite – the cave was quiet and free from external sounds.
* **C: 他需要很少的独处时间 (He needed very little alone time):**  The fact that he *sought out* a remote cave specifically for meditation implies he *needed* and valued alone time.
* **D: 他担心被人看到和听到 (He worried about being seen and heard):** The text focuses on the *isolation* being purposeful for his spirituality, not out of fear of being discovered. The difficulty finding the cave suggests it was intentionally secluded.



"
根据这段文字，铁最初被用于什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 轨道**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""人们逐渐意识到，如果在铁轨上放上铁片，铁轨会更稳固有效。 这成了普遍做法...""  This directly indicates that iron was initially used to reinforce the *rails* (轨道) themselves, making them stronger and more effective.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 轨枕 (ties/sleepers):** The passage mentions track ties were introduced *before* iron was used on the rails.
*   **B: 货车道 (truck roads):** Truck roads were originally made of wood. Iron was added *to* the roads, not used for the initial construction of the road itself.
*   **C: 轮子 (wheels):** Iron wheels came *after* iron rails were in use, as the iron rails wore out the wooden wheels.



"
根据这段文字，为什么木伦被铁轮取代？,"The correct answer is **D: 它们被轨道上的铁片磨损**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""…but the iron plates made the wooden cart wheels wear down more severely. Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 它们增加了马匹的速度:** The passage says the *tracks* helped horses go faster, not the wheels themselves.
* **B: 它们被认为更高效:** While iron wheels were ultimately more durable, the passage doesn't state they were initially considered more efficient.
* **C: 它们能够处理更大的负载:** The passage doesn't mention load capacity as a reason for the switch.



"
根据这段文字，在浪漫主义时期是什么塑造了个体？,"The correct answer is **B: 地理**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: **""在浪漫主义的背景下，地理塑造了个体""** (In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped the individual). 

While customs and culture *emerge* from that geographical influence, the passage identifies **geography** as the primary shaper of the individual during the Romantic period. The passage also contrasts geography with ""arbitrarily imposed laws,"" showing geography is presented as the formative force.



"
以下哪项陈述不反映技术决定论的一般观点？ ,"The correct answer is **A: 技术对社会的影响是社会条件制约的**.

Here's why:

* **Technical Determinism** as described in the passage asserts that technology's development is largely independent of cultural or political influences *and* that its effects on society are inherent and not constrained by social conditions.

Let's break down why the other options *do* reflect technical determinism:

* **B: 技术的发展不受文化影响** - The passage explicitly states this is a core idea of technical determinism (""technology's development...largely transcends cultural or political influence"").
* **C: 技术对社会有内在的影响** - The passage states this as well (""technology...has an inherent ‘impact’ on society, unconstrained by social conditions"").
* **D: 技术的发展不基于政治影响** - This is very similar to B and also directly supported by the passage's description of technical determinism.

Option A, however, *contradicts* technical determinism.  Technical determinism argues the *opposite* - that social conditions do *not* constrain technology's impact.  The example given in the passage (roads needing to be built to accommodate cars, and medical tech needing to develop due to accidents) illustrates how technology drives societal changes, not the other way around, according to this view.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪个与拉弓无关？,"The correct answer is **A: 声音更柔和 (sounds softer)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** 上弓 (up-bow) usually produces a *softer* sound.  The question asks what is *not* related to *pulling* the bow. While softer sound *results* from an up-bow, it isn't *how* you pull the bow.

Let's look at why the other options *are* related to pulling the bow:

* **B: 看起来像钉书钉的符号 (looks like a staple/square with no bottom)** - This *describes* the down-bow symbol, which indicates how to pull the bow.
* **C: 声音更强烈 (sounds stronger)** -  The passage states down-bows produce a *stronger* sound.
* **D: 从弓根处开始 (starts from the frog/where you hold the bow)** - The passage explicitly states down-bows start from the frog (bow root).



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项与柔和的声音有关？,"The correct answer is **C: 像“V”形的符号**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""上弓符号像字母 V，“上弓通常会发出更加柔和的声音...""  Therefore, the V-shaped symbol (上弓) is directly linked to a softer sound.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: “下弓”符号** - The text says this produces a *stronger* sound.
*   **B: 拉弓** - This just describes *how* you move the bow, not the resulting sound.
*   **D: 从手握弓的地方开始** - This describes the technique for *down-bows* (下弓), which are associated with a stronger sound.



"
化石表明，手的适应性主要用于以下哪一项？,"The correct answer is **A: 操作**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""200 万到 300 万年前的手骨化石，都无不体现出手部特征，从移动方式到操作方式，经历了改变。"" This directly links the changes in hand structure to a shift *towards* manipulation (操作).
* **The passage contrasts human hands with chimpanzee hands:** Chimpanzee hands are adapted for weight-bearing during knuckle-walking. Human hands evolved to be shorter and straighter, *away* from weight-bearing and *towards* dexterity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 托起重物 (To bear weight):** The passage specifically says humans *stopped* using their hands for this.
* **C: 移动 (Movement):**  While hands are involved in movement, the passage focuses on the *change* from hand-assisted movement to other forms (like bipedalism) and then to manipulation.
* **D: 指背行走 (Knuckle-walking):** This is a characteristic of chimpanzees, and humans evolved *away* from that.



"
以下哪项准确描述了黑猩猩的指（趾）骨？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 它们用于托起重物**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""黑猩猩手脚的大小和长度相似，这反映出手在指背行走中用来承重的事实."" (Black chimpanzees have similar sizes and lengths of hands and feet, which reflects the fact that hands are used to support weight in knuckle-walking.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 它们比人类的更直** - The passage states *human* finger/toe bones are straighter.
* **B: 它们的手脚大小不同** - The passage explicitly says they are *similar* in size.
* **D: 它们主要用于操作** - While chimps *can* manipulate objects, the passage focuses on their role in weight-bearing during locomotion.



"
选择从哪个池中移除新的基因变异？,"The correct answer is **D: 显性**

Here's why:

The passage states, ""选择则会从**表达的**基因变异池中把变异移除。"" (Selection removes variation from the **expressed** gene variation pool).  

Dominant genes are *always* expressed when present. While recessive genes are only expressed when paired with another recessive gene. Therefore, selection would act on and remove variation from the pool of **dominant** genes (those that are expressed) far more readily than the pool of recessive genes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 隐性 (Recessive):** Recessive traits are only expressed when an organism has two copies of the recessive allele. Selection can act on recessive traits, but it's less direct as they're ""hidden"" when paired with a dominant allele.
*   **B: 重组 (Recombination):** Recombination *creates* new variation, it doesn't represent a pool from which selection removes variation.
*   **C: 分离 (Segregation):** Segregation is the separation of alleles during gamete formation, also creating variation. It is not the pool from which selection acts.



"
哪个过程会添加新的基因变异？,"The correct answer is **C: 突变 (Mutation)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""突变会添加新的基因变异 (Mutations add new genetic variation).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 分离 (Segregation):** Segregation is the separation of alleles during gamete formation, it *moves* existing variation, it doesn't *add* new variation.
* **B: 重组 (Recombination):** Recombination also *rearranges* existing variation, it doesn’t create new variation.
* **D: 显性 (Dominance):** Dominance describes how traits are expressed, not how variation is created.



"
根据文中信息，哪种食物是灵长类动物为解决“蛋白质问题”而应该吃的？,"The correct answer is **C: 蚂蚱**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""动物性食物（蚂蚁、白蚁、蛋）不仅容易消化，而且能提供大量蛋白质，里面含有全部必需的氨基酸."" (Animal foods – ants, termites, eggs – are not only easily digestible but also provide abundant protein, containing all the essential amino acids.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 枯萎的叶子 (Withered leaves):** The passage mentions leaves as a resource, but notes they are *difficult* to digest.
* **B: 生的豆科植物 (Raw legumes):** The passage also mentions legumes, but states they are *difficult* to digest unless cooked.
* **D: 花茎 (Flower stems):** The passage does not mention flower stems at all.

The passage specifically highlights animal foods like ants and termites (and by extension, insects like grasshoppers - 蚂蚱) as a readily digestible and complete protein source for primates. Therefore, 蚂蚱 (grasshoppers) is the most appropriate answer.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪个问题不是由于缺乏必需的氨基酸引起的？,"The correct answer is **A: 消化问题**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that primates *have* digestive systems like humans but *struggle to digest* plant proteins unless cooked.  It's the *difficulty in digesting* plant proteins that's the issue, not a lack of a digestive system itself.  The passage then links a lack of amino acids (obtained through easily digestible protein) to growth inhibition, malnutrition, and death.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 营养不良 (Malnutrition):** The text explicitly states malnutrition is a consequence of not getting enough amino acids.
* **C: 生长抑制 (Growth inhibition):** The text explicitly states growth inhibition is a consequence of not getting enough amino acids.
* **D: 死亡 (Death):** The text explicitly states death is a consequence of not getting enough amino acids.

Therefore, digestive problems are presented as a *reason why* primates struggle to get enough amino acids, not a *result of* lacking those amino acids."
一个特定亚文化的成员通常如何表示他们与该团体的关联？,"The correct answer is **D: 象征性地利用独特的行事风格**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""亚文化群体的成员，常常会象征性地利用独特的行事风格来表明他们的成员身份，包括时尚服装、举止和黑话。"" (Members of subcultures often symbolically utilize distinctive styles of behavior to indicate their membership, including fashion, gestures and slang.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 试图融入 (Trying to fit in)** - Subcultures often *reject* mainstream fitting in, and are about standing out.
*   **B: 接受周围每个人的信仰 (Accepting the beliefs of everyone around them)** - Subcultures have their *own* distinct beliefs.
*   **C: 接受社会规范 (Accepting social norms)** - Subcultures often *challenge* or deviate from social norms.



"
根据文中提出的理论，一个被模式化观念认为会从事威胁行为的少数族裔的孩子可能会发生什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 孩子更有可能参与威胁行为**.

Here's why:

The passage explains a self-fulfilling prophecy effect. When a stereotype exists (e.g., a minority group is expected to underperform in school, or in this case, engage in threatening behavior), and members of that group *become aware* of the stereotype, they may internalize it and behave in a way that confirms it. This isn't because the stereotype is true, but because the expectation influences their behavior.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 孩子会试图避免参与威胁行为:** This would be the opposite of the described effect. The passage suggests they're *more* likely to engage in the behavior.
* **C: 孩子会在社交场合中变得内向:** While possible, the passage focuses specifically on how stereotypes impact behavior related to the stereotype itself, not general social withdrawal.
* **D: 孩子会拒绝与其他少数族裔接触:** The passage doesn't suggest a rejection of their own group; it's about internalizing expectations *about* their group.



"
根据这段文字，一个孩子对种族刻板印象的了解可能会对以下哪个方面产生影响？,"The correct answer is **B: Their behavior**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""these stereotypes can influence their behavior."" It gives the example of a stereotype about academic performance leading to poorer performance once the child is aware of it.

Let's look at why the other options are less directly supported:

*   **A: They choose to identify with a minority group:** The passage doesn't discuss identity formation, only how stereotypes *affect* behavior.
*   **C: Their relationships with other children:** While stereotypes *could* indirectly impact relationships, the passage doesn't mention this.
*   **D: Their definition of race:** The passage focuses on the *impact* of existing stereotypes, not on how children develop their understanding of race itself.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪一项不太可能符合野孩子的成长背景？,"The correct answer is **B: 较强的对话能力**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that ""野孩"" (wild children) lack socialization due to isolation and lack of adult interaction.** Socialization is crucial for developing language and communication skills.  Therefore, it's *unlikely* a wild child would have strong conversational abilities.

Let's look at why the other options are plausible:

* **A: 独立生活 (Independent living):** The passage mentions children living alone in the wilderness.
* **C: 隐居倾向 (Tendency to seclusion):** Being isolated from human contact would likely *cause* a tendency to avoid social interaction.
* **D: 社交焦虑 (Social anxiety):**  A lack of socialization and potentially traumatic experiences (abuse, abandonment) would strongly suggest social anxiety when exposed to others.

Therefore, strong conversational ability is the least likely characteristic of a wild child as described in the passage."
根据这段文字，以下哪一项准确描述了野孩子的行为？,"The correct answer is **B: 野性行为可能源于缺乏社会化**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""These children...did not achieve socialization with the help of adults."" and links this lack of socialization to their ""wild"" behavior.  It then goes on to describe how being raised by animals or in isolation leads to behaviors resembling those animals (fear of humans, indifference).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 大部分野性行为是由身体缺陷引起的** - The passage mentions physical defects *as a reason some children were abandoned*, but doesn't say defects *cause* the wild behavior.
* **C: 野性行为仅在被父母幽禁的孩子中普遍存在** - The passage lists multiple scenarios for becoming a ""wild child"" – abandonment, being raised by animals, running away, etc., not just confinement.
* **D: 所有野性行为都是由严重的智力缺陷引起的** -  The passage mentions intellectual disabilities as a reason for abandonment, but doesn’t claim it's the *sole* cause of wild behavior.



"
基于这段文字，以下哪项做法与自给农业不一致？,"The correct answer is **B: 生产食品以出售给他人**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states self-sufficiency agriculture is for producing food *only* to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.** Selling food to others moves beyond self-sufficiency and into market-oriented agriculture.

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with the passage:

* **A: 专注于满足农业者及其家人所需的产量** - This is the *definition* of self-sufficiency agriculture.
* **C: 专注于高产量而非先进技术** - The passage says it uses simple techniques like crop rotation to *maximize* yield, implying a focus on output rather than complex technology.
* **D: 采购农民所在地区的种子** - The passage mentions utilizing locally preserved seeds.



"
以下哪项准确描述了自给农业的做法？,"The correct answer is **D: 在一些国家，仍有农民在使用这种方式** (In some countries, farmers still use this method).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""如今在很多发展中国家，情况依然如此"" (Nowadays, this is still the case in many developing countries).  This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 这是一个完全有机的系统** (It is a completely organic system) - The passage says it's *usually* organic, not *completely* organic.  ""Usually"" doesn't equate to ""completely"".
* **B: 它使用独特的技术来最大限度地提高产量** (It uses unique technologies to maximize yield) - The passage states it uses ""relatively simple techniques"" like crop rotation, not *unique* or advanced technologies.
* **C: 它允许农业者在整个地区分享他们的农作物** (It allows farmers to share their crops throughout the region) - The passage focuses on production for the farmer and their family, not sharing with a wider region.



"
参观博物馆属于以下哪种旅游类别？,"The correct answer is **C: 文化旅游**.

Here's why:

The passage states that cultural tourism involves ""understand[ing] its history and culture."" Visiting a museum is a direct way to learn about a place's history and culture. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 商务旅游** - This involves travel for work purposes.
*   **B: 休闲旅游** - This is about relaxation and entertainment (like beaches or theme parks), not necessarily learning.
*   **D: 户外旅游** - This focuses on outdoor activities and nature."
根据这段文字，以下哪个可能是休闲游客的优先事项？,"The correct answer is **B: 从他们的日常生活中抽身出来 (To get away from their daily routines)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that leisure travel is about going to a place ""completely different from their everyday life"" for ""relaxation and recreation."" This directly corresponds to wanting to distance oneself from daily routines.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 沉浸于当地文化 (Immerse themselves in the local culture)** - This describes *cultural* tourism, not leisure tourism.
*   **C: 参观重要的地标 (Visit important landmarks)** - While leisure tourists *might* visit landmarks, it's not the primary focus. Cultural tourists are more likely to prioritize this.
*   **D: 了解一个地方的历史 (Learn about a place's history)** - This is again a key element of *cultural* tourism.



"
文中提到了什么有助于减轻当地教会对变化的恐惧感？,"The correct answer is **A: 回顾成功的创业行为**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""在这种情况下，回顾之前的创业行为和取得的成功可以帮助人们对当地教会的新变化和新方向保持开放的态度。 这样的成功故事让人们对变化的恐惧感减轻了，同时为未来的变革营造出正面的倾向。""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 洞察影响组织文化的人物:** While understanding these figures is *helpful* for context, the passage doesn't directly link it to reducing fear of change.
* **C: 发现组织的驱动力:**  Understanding drivers is a result of the process, not the direct cause of lessening fear.
* **D: 了解组织的历史:**  Similar to C, history provides context but isn't the specific element stated to reduce fear.



"
根据这段文字，了解自己的历史有什么帮助？,"The best answer is **A: 减轻对变化的恐惧感**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""这样的成功故事让人们对变化的恐惧感减轻了，同时为未来的变革营造出正面的倾向。"" This directly links understanding history to reducing fear of change.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: 强化价值观:** While understanding history *leads to* a deeper understanding of values (mentioned in the text: ""会对组织的价值观、使命和驱动力有更深刻的认识""), the primary benefit described is reduced fear of change.
* **C: 在组织中找到自己的位置:** The text says understanding history helps people ""了解自己在组织历史中的位置,"" but this is a *result* of understanding history, not the main help it provides.
* **D: 改善创业行为:** The text focuses on reviewing *past* entrepreneurial actions, not necessarily improving future ones. It's about learning *from* the past, not directly improving behavior.



"
以下哪项陈述准确描述了后现代主义学习方法？,"The correct answer is **D: 在学习中没有绝对 (In learning, there are no absolutes)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""并没有一种学习方法是好的学习方法 (There is no one good way to learn)."" and ""后现代主义学习方法给人带来绝对的自由 (Postmodern learning methods give absolute freedom)."" This directly supports the idea that there are no fixed rules or 'absolutes' in learning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 某些学习经验比其他经验更有益 (Some learning experiences are more beneficial than others):** The passage argues *against* this idea, saying there's no inherently ""good"" learning method.
* **B: 学习应集中于我们认为自己会经历的事情 (Learning should focus on things we believe we will experience):**  The passage *criticizes* this, pointing out how we consume information about things we'll likely *never* do.
* **C: 某些学习方式比其他方式更好 (Some learning methods are better than others):**  This is the opposite of what the passage states.



"
以下哪项陈述没有准确反映后现代主义学习方法？,"The correct answer is **B: 应优先考虑某些学习经验**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that ""there is no good way to learn.""** This directly contradicts the idea of prioritizing certain learning experiences.  The post-modern approach described suggests *all* experiences are equal (or rather, none are inherently better).

Let's look at why the other options *are* reflected in the passage:

* **A: 有很多学习信息的方式 (There are many ways to learn information):** The passage supports this with examples like DIY, informational shows, and television programs.
* **C: 学习经验依赖于学习者和所呈现的知识 (Learning experiences depend on the learner and the presented knowledge):** The passage states learning happens when knowledge *presents itself* to the learner, highlighting the importance of both the learner's experience and the knowledge itself.
* **D: 我们可能永远不会应用的知识仍然值得学习 (Knowledge we may never apply is still worth learning):** The entire point of the passage is that we passively consume information (watching shows about car repair, etc.) *without* applying it, yet the experience still constitutes learning according to this post-modern view.



"
在正常睡眠期间有意地醒来后，哪些会干扰睡眠中断过程？,"The correct answer is **A: 在重新入睡前阅读一个半小时 (In reading for an hour and a half before falling back asleep)**.

Here's why:

* **Sleep Interruption**, as defined in the passage, is about *briefly* waking and then *quickly* returning to sleep (10-60 minutes).  The goal is to minimize full wakefulness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 上厕所并立即回到床上 (Going to the bathroom and immediately returning to bed)** - The passage *suggests* using the need to urinate to *initiate* a sleep interruption, but doesn't say immediately returning to bed is bad. In fact, the described process involves waking *to* go to the bathroom.
* **C: 关闭床头柜上的闹钟，二十分钟后重新入睡 (Turning off the alarm on the nightstand and falling back asleep in twenty minutes)** - This aligns perfectly with the described process – waking briefly to deal with the alarm and then re-sleeping within the 10-60 minute window.
* **D: 起床从床头柜上的瓶子里喝水 (Getting up to drink water from a bottle on the nightstand)** - Similar to the alarm clock, this involves getting out of bed, which is a technique suggested to avoid immediately falling back asleep.

**Why A is correct:** Reading for an hour and a half would *significantly* extend the wakefulness period, defeating the purpose of a brief sleep interruption. It would make it much harder to fall back asleep within the desired timeframe.



"
以下哪项不是关于睡眠中断的准确描述？,"The correct answer is **D: 醒来后，目标是在两个小时内重新入睡**.

Here's why:

The passage states the re-sleep period is **10-60 minutes** after intentionally waking up. Option D suggests a two-hour timeframe, which contradicts the provided information.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate:

* **A: 它可以基于生物节律** (It can be based on biological rhythms) - The text mentions ""other based on biological rhythms"" options like drinking liquids before bed.
* **B: 目标是不完全吵醒自己** (The goal is not to fully wake yourself) - The passage explicitly says to use a relatively quiet alarm to wake up *without* being fully aroused.
* **C: 该过程发生在正常睡眠期间** (The process happens during normal sleep) - The definition of sleep interruption states it occurs ""during normal sleep"".



"
当大脑更频繁地做清醒梦时，会增加哪个方面？,"The correct answer is **D: 快速眼动状态之间的时间间隔 (The time interval between REM states)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that lucid dreaming *increases* the time interval between REM periods. This lengthening is the primary reason why it leads to feeling drained, as it reduces the frequency of restorative REM sleep.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 快速眼动状态的次数 (Number of REM states):** The passage suggests REM periods become *less* frequent, not more.
* **B: 能量水平 (Energy levels):** The passage states lucid dreaming leads to *lower* energy levels.
* **C: 恢复状态的长度 (Length of restorative states):** The passage implies REM periods are disrupted and likely shorter, not longer.



"
频繁做清醒梦可能对身体产生以下哪种负面影响？,"The correct answer is **B: 每晚快速眼动的次数减少 (Every night the number of REM cycles decreases)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that lucid dreaming *extends* the time between REM periods.  This means you have *fewer* REM periods overall each night. The analogy to waking up every 20-30 minutes to watch TV illustrates how less time in restorative REM sleep leads to exhaustion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 快速眼动状态之间的时间间隔缩短 (The time interval between REM states is shortened)** - The passage states the *opposite* – the interval is *extended*.
*   **C: 对清醒梦的依赖 (Dependence on lucid dreams)** - The passage doesn't mention dependency, only physical fatigue.
*   **D: 每晚快速眼动的次数增加 (The number of REM cycles every night increases)** - Again, the passage says REM periods *decrease*.



"
根据这段文字，传统团队和虚拟团队有什么相似之处？,"The correct answer is **A: 两种团队预计有同等水平的工作表现 (Both teams are expected to have the same level of work performance)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""虚拟团队需要坚持与传统团队同样的质量标准..."" This directly means both types of teams are held to the same standards of quality/performance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The text says virtual team members *often have more* autonomy than traditional team members, not that both have similar levels.
* **C:** The ""invisible team"" is specifically described as a unique component of *virtual* teams, not both.
* **D:** The text points out that virtual teams often deal with different time zones, which directly contradicts the idea of both being in the same time zone.



"
根据这段文字，关于实体团队和虚拟团队的陈述中哪个不正确？,"The correct answer is **A: 传统团队通常被要求达到更高的标准**.

Here's why:

The passage states that virtual teams need to maintain *the same* quality standards as traditional teams, not *higher* ones. It explicitly says they need to adhere to the same standards.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: 虚拟团队经常充当传统团队的接洽点** - The text says virtual team members ""often serve as liaisons to their corresponding face-to-face teams.""
* **C: 传统团队比虚拟团队拥有的自主权更少** - The text states virtual team members ""often have more autonomy than their traditional team counterparts.""  Therefore, traditional teams have *less*.
* **D: 不同的时区可以使虚拟团队受益** - The passage indicates different time zones necessitate more autonomy for virtual team members and suggests this is a factor in how they operate.

Therefore, only option A contradicts the information provided in the passage.



"
以下哪项不是内容理论的核心？,"The correct answer is **B: 环境如何影响人们的行为**.

Here's why:

* **Content theories of motivation** focus on *internal* factors that drive people – their needs, desires, and values. The passage explicitly states they look for ""factors...people recognize or find interesting"" and how needs are ""internalized.""

* While the environment *can* influence motivation, it's the focus of **process theories** of motivation (like Expectancy Theory, Goal-Setting Theory, etc.). Process theories explain *how* motivation happens, looking at cognitive processes and how external factors affect those processes.

Let's look at why the other options *are* core to content theories:

* **A: 在成年后显现的新欲望 (New desires that appear after adulthood):** The passage mentions needs/desires being internalized as people mature.
* **C: 被内化的需求 (Internalized needs):** This is directly stated as a key element of content theories.
* **D: 理解人们的喜好 (Understanding people's preferences):** Finding ""factors people recognize or find interesting"" is central to understanding what motivates them.



"
以下哪项不是三分法的对象？,"The correct answer is **B: 在照片中营造活力和能量 (Creating dynamism and energy in a photograph)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the rule of thirds is a *simple guiding method* for creating dynamism *and* it helps keep images orderly. However, its primary function isn't to *create* energy, but rather to effectively *place* the subject in a way that contributes to a feeling of balance and visual interest, which can *result* in dynamism.  The rule focuses on *where* you put things, not on directly *creating* an emotional feeling.

Let's look at why the other options are correct aspects of the rule of thirds as described in the passage:

*   **A: 创建一个基准，确定主体可能被放置的位置 (Creating a baseline to determine where the subject can be placed)** - The passage explicitly says it ""points to the most effective positions"" using the intersecting lines.
*   **C: 将主体保持在特定且有效的位置 (Keeping the subject in a specific and effective position)** - This directly reflects the core idea of using intersection points.
*   **D: 在照片中建立秩序 (Establishing order in a photograph)** - The passage states it helps ""keep images orderly"".



"
以下哪个选项没有描述 35mm 摄影格式？,"The correct answer is **C: 它具有与许多常见格式不同的宽高比**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that many common formats *share* the same or a similar aspect ratio to 35mm (3:2). Therefore, it does *not* have a different aspect ratio than many common formats – it’s similar!

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: 它仍有生产** - The text states ""至今日仍有生产"" (it is still produced today).
*   **B: 它被数码相机格式采用** - The text states its aspect ratio ""应用到了数码相机图像传感器的格式上"" (is applied to the format of digital camera image sensors).
*   **D: 它是世界上最常见的格式** - The text begins with ""世界上最常见的静态图像摄影格式是 35mm 格式"" (The most common static image photography format in the world is 35mm format).



"
根据这段文字，随着制造商提高镜头生产质量，变焦镜头如何得到改进？,"The correct answer is **C: 它们的照片质量与固定焦距镜头相似**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""As lens manufacturers reach higher standards in lens production, this is less of an issue. This allows zoom lenses to take photos comparable in quality to fixed focal length lenses.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 它们具有更高的镜头速度** - The passage states zoom lenses *typically have a smaller* maximum aperture (speed).
* **B: 它们在弱光条件下更容易使用** - The passage states cheap zoom lenses are *difficult* to use in low light.
* **D: 它们比定焦镜头的焦距复杂度更低** - The passage states zoom lenses have *higher* complexity.



"
根据文中提供的信息，什么情况下变焦镜头比定焦镜头更可取？,"The correct answer is **C: 如果你不想在较暗的环境中使用闪光灯**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""变焦镜头的另一个缺点是镜头的最大光圈（速度）通常较小。 这使得廉价的变焦镜头在没有闪光灯的情况下很难在弱光条件下使用。"" This directly implies that if you *don't* want to use a flash in low light, a zoom lens *might* not be ideal.  However, the passage also indicates that zoom lens quality has improved, suggesting you *could* get a zoom lens with a larger aperture if needed (though likely more expensive).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 如果最大光圈很高是优先考虑因素** - The passage explicitly states zoom lenses *typically* have smaller maximum apertures than prime lenses.
* **B: 如果你想使用更少的透镜元件** - The passage states zoom lenses require *more* lens elements.
* **D: 如果你想要更高的焦距复杂度** - While zoom lenses *have* higher focal complexity, the passage doesn't suggest this is a benefit; it's a characteristic that used to be a drawback.



"
下列哪项不是对神秘主义的准确描述？,"The correct answer is **D: 强调寻求个人直接体验，与许多其他形式的宗教信仰和崇拜相当**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that mystical pursuits *distinguish themselves* from other forms of religion and worship *because* they emphasize direct, personal experience. Saying it's *comparable* to other forms contradicts this core distinction. 

Let's look at why the other options are accurate based on the passage:

*   **A: 强调体验和平与幸福的意识状态** - The passage explicitly mentions ""peaceful, insightful, blissful, or even ecstatic states of consciousness.""
*   **B: 神秘主义的追随者寻求对精神真理的知觉认识** - The passage states they seek ""communication, union, or awareness of ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truths, or God.""
*   **C: 神秘主义的追随者可能采取实践来培养他们对神圣的现实的洞察力** - The passage says followers pursue ""a way of life or practices aimed at nurturing these experiences.""



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不是神秘主义的关注重点？,"The correct answer is **B: Through shared communal experiences to pursue insight.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that mysticism emphasizes **personal, direct experience** of the divine – individual intuition and enlightenment. It focuses on *individual* states of consciousness (peaceful, insightful, blissful, ecstatic). 

Option B, pursuing insight through *shared communal experiences*, is the opposite of this emphasis on individual experience. While religion often involves communal practices, mysticism, as described in the text, is about the individual's direct connection to the ultimate reality.

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with the passage:

*   **A: Pursuing intuition of the sacred reality** - The text explicitly mentions ""direct experience, intuition.""
*   **C: Emphasizing blissful states of consciousness** - The text lists ""peaceful, insightful, blissful, even ecstatic"" states.
*   **D: Pursuing awareness of God** - The text mentions ""communion with, union with, or awareness of ultimate reality, the divine, or God.""



"
根据这段文章，谁可能开创了一个农业社会？,"The correct answer is **C: 来自波利尼西亚的毛利人**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...毛利人从波利尼西亚乘“大船”迁移，并从莫里奥里人手中夺取了新西兰，建立了一个农业社会."" ( ""...the Maori migrated from Polynesia by 'great canoes' and took New Zealand from the Moriori, establishing an agricultural society."")

Therefore, the Maori who came from Polynesia are credited with establishing the agricultural society.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 来自新西兰的莫里奥里人** - The text says the Maori *took* New Zealand *from* the Moriori, not the other way around.
*   **B: 来自查塔姆群岛的莫里奥里人** - The Moriori of the Chatham Islands developed a *peaceful* culture, not an agricultural one that took over New Zealand.
*   **D: 来自大陆的毛利人** - The passage indicates the Moriori of the mainland were a branch of the Maori, and the original agricultural society was established by the Polynesian Maori.



"
根据这段文字，猎取恐鸟的群体是哪个地方的最早居民？,"The correct answer is **B: 新西兰**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""for a long time people believed the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Māori, who hunted the large bird called the moa."" This directly links the hunting of the moa (恐鸟) to the earliest inhabitants of *New Zealand*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 大陆 (Continent):** The text mentions ""大陆毛利人族群"" (mainland Māori groups) but doesn't say they were the *first* inhabitants overall. It says they migrated *from* New Zealand.
*   **C: 查塔姆群岛 (Chatham Islands):** The Moriori people lived on the Chatham Islands, but the text reveals they *originally* came from New Zealand.
*   **D: 波利尼西亚 (Polynesia):** The Māori migrated *from* Polynesia, but weren't the first inhabitants of New Zealand according to the initial belief described in the text."
在哪种情况下，使用净土折纸方法会使折纸人受益？,"The correct answer is **D: 折纸人之前只尝试过一两次 (Fold origami artists have only tried a couple of times before)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** 净土折纸 (Pureland Origami) was developed ""to help inexperienced origami people or people with poor dexterity.""  Someone who has only tried origami a couple of times is, by definition, inexperienced.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 折纸人喜欢一次性进行多次折叠 (Origami artists like to make multiple folds at once)** - Pureland origami *limits* you to one fold at a time.
* **B: 折纸人具有高超的动手能力 (Origami artists have excellent dexterity)** -  Pureland origami is *for* people with *poor* dexterity.
* **C: 折纸人正在创作需要反向折叠的折纸作品 (Origami artists are creating origami that requires reverse folds)** -  The passage explicitly states reverse folds are *not allowed* in Pureland origami.



"
以下哪项不准确地描述了净土折纸？,"The correct answer is **A: It is suitable for experienced origami artists.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Pureland Origami was *developed to help inexperienced or physically challenged origami enthusiasts*.  Therefore, it would *not* be suitable for experienced artists.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate based on the text:

* **B: The method does not include reverse folds** - The passage states ""it does not allow reverse folding"".
* **C: Folding positions must be simple and clear** - The passage states ""all folding positions must be simple and clear.""
* **D: It is a good method for those with limited dexterity** - The passage states it was developed ""to help those with limited dexterity"".



"
根据这段文字，以下哪个地点与印度河流域文明无关？,"The correct answer is **C: 阿富汗东北部所有地区**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""印度河流域文明...覆盖的区域包括了现代巴基斯坦的大部分地区，以及印度西北部和阿富汗东北部**一些**地区。"" (The Indus Valley Civilization...covered areas including most of modern Pakistan, as well as parts of northwestern India and **some** regions of northeastern Afghanistan.)

* This key word ""**some**"" indicates that *not all* of northeastern Afghanistan was part of the Indus Valley Civilization.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 哈拉帕 (Harappa):** The passage explicitly states the civilization is also called the ""Harappan Civilization"" and is named after the Harappa site.
* **B: 萨拉斯瓦蒂河 (Saraswati River):** The passage mentions the debate about renaming the civilization ""Indus-Saraswati Civilization"" due to evidence of it existing along the now-dry Saraswati River.
* **D: 现代巴基斯坦的大部分地区 (Most of modern Pakistan):** The passage directly states the civilization covered most of modern Pakistan.



"
以下哪个不是在文章中提到的青铜时代文明的可能名称？,"The correct answer is **D: 印度河流域文明**.

Here's why:

* **哈拉帕文明 (Harappan civilization)** is directly mentioned as a name derived from the first excavated site.
* **印度河-萨拉斯瓦蒂河文明 (Indus-Saraswati civilization)** is mentioned as a proposed name by some scholars.
* **印度河文明 (Indus civilization)** is stated as the name the civilization gets because of the Indus river.
* **印度河流域文明 (Indus Valley civilization)** is used as an introductory description, stating *where* the civilization was, not a specific name *for* the civilization itself. It explains the region, but isn't presented *as* a name.

Therefore, ""印度河流域文明"" is a descriptive phrase, not one of the named possibilities for the civilization.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪个能够获得长远利益？,"The correct answer is **A: 与他人合作 (Cooperate with others)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""从长远来看，与他人合作才是最佳选择 (From a long-term perspective, cooperating with others is the best choice).""  While the passage acknowledges that short-term selfishness can be tempting, it ultimately advocates for cooperation as the path to lasting benefit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 优先考虑自己的利益 (Prioritize one's own interests):** The passage says this *might* bring short-term gains, but isn't the best long-term strategy.
* **C: 强调少数人的利益优于多数人 (Emphasize the interests of a few over the many):** This directly contradicts the idea of cooperation benefitting ""most people.""
* **D: 认识到贪婪可能是有益的 (Recognize that greed can be beneficial):**  The passage acknowledges greed and selfishness exist, but doesn't present them as ultimately beneficial. It frames them as temptations that can be outweighed by the benefits of cooperation.



"
根据这段文字，如果某人关注于即时利益，他们可能会优先考虑以下哪个？,"The correct answer is **D: 自私 (Selfishness)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that greed and selfishness are always present and that selfish acts *can* bring short-term benefits.  Someone focused on *instant* gains would likely prioritize those selfish actions, as described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 无私 (Altruism)** - The passage contrasts selfishness with cooperation, implying altruism is *not* the immediate focus of someone prioritizing instant benefit.
*   **B: 互助 (Mutual Aid)** - Mutual aid involves helping others, which isn't the immediate focus of someone seeking instant gains.
*   **C: 合作 (Cooperation)** - While the passage *advocates* for cooperation as the best long-term strategy, it acknowledges that selfishness is more appealing in the short term.



"
根据这段文字，谁支付了战争开支的重要部分？,"The correct answer is **D: 菲律宾人民**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""美帝国主义在征服菲律宾时的战争开支是由菲律宾人民自己支付的。 他们被迫向美国殖民政权纳税，用于支付大部分开支...""  This directly indicates the Filipino people bore the cost of the war.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 菲律宾政府:** While taxes were collected *through* the government, the text says the people were *forced* to pay them, meaning the burden was on them, not the government itself. The bonds were issued *in the name* of the government, but paid for by the people.
*   **B: 华尔街银行:** The banks profited from the interest on the bonds, but didn't *pay* the initial war expenses.
*   **C: 美国殖民政权:** The colonial regime *received* the payments, but the text clarifies where the money came *from* - the Filipino people.



"
哪个时期在圣殿骑士时代之前？,"The correct answer is **C: 中世纪早期**.

The passage states: ""中世纪盛期之前是中世纪早期..."" and that the Templars existed during the High Middle Ages (11th-13th centuries). Therefore, the Early Middle Ages preceded the Templar period."
哪个时期在圣殿骑士时代之后？,"The correct answer is **A: 中世纪晚期**.

The passage states: ""中世纪盛期之前是中世纪早期，之后是中世纪晚期..."" (The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages...). Since the passage defines the Templars' time as the High Middle Ages, the period *after* that is the Late Middle Ages.
"
文中未提及罗马帝国时期被医生和外科医生使用的哪种医疗治疗或手术？,"The correct answer is **A: 用各种镇静剂治疗创伤后应激障碍**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Roman surgeons understood various sedatives, including morphine and scopolamine (from henbane seeds).  However, it *doesn't* mention using these sedatives to treat post-traumatic stress.  Their use was for pain management during procedures.
* **The passage states:** scopolamine was extracted from henbane seeds (Option B)
* **The passage states:** the use of tourniquets and arterial forceps to stop blood flow (Option C)
* **The passage states:** skilled at amputation to save patients with gangrene (Option D)

Therefore, option A is the only treatment/surgery not mentioned in the text."
根据这段文字，以下哪个不是归功于罗马帝国医学领域的进步？,"The correct answer is **C: 学习型医院的创建** (The creation of teaching hospitals).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:**
    * **A: 医疗队的组建** - ""奥古斯都皇帝开始...组建了第一支罗马医疗队"" (Augustus began recruiting doctors and even forming the first Roman medical corps).
    * **B: 帝国的侵略性军事政策** - ""罗马帝国的军国主义性质促进了医学的进步和发展"" (The militaristic nature of the Roman Empire promoted progress and development in medicine).
    * **D: 皇帝对医生的招募** - ""奥古斯都皇帝开始招募医生"" (Augustus began recruiting doctors).

* **The passage *does not* mention:** anything about the creation of teaching hospitals. It highlights advancements in surgery, pharmacology (use of morphine and hyoscyamine), and treatment of wounds, but not the establishment of hospitals specifically for learning/training.

Therefore, the only option *not* supported by the text is the creation of teaching hospitals.



"
视觉依赖于什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 视觉系统感觉器官**.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""视觉或看的能力依赖于视觉系统的感觉器官，即眼睛。"" (Vision or the ability to see relies on the sensory organs of the visual system, namely the eyes.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 生物体的需要 (The needs of the organism):** While the passage mentions needs *influence* eye structure, vision doesn't *depend* on them directly.
* **C: 对特定波长的敏感度 (Sensitivity to specific wavelengths):** This is a *characteristic* of different eyes, not what vision itself depends on.
* **D: 不同程度的敏锐度 (Different degrees of sharpness):** Similar to C, this is a *quality* of vision, not its fundamental dependency.



"
生物体之间眼睛结构的变化取决于什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 生物体的需要 (The needs of the organism)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""眼睛的构造有许多种，其复杂程度**取决于生物体的需要** (The structure of the eye varies in many ways, its complexity depending on the needs of the organism).""

While wavelength sensitivity (A) and sharpness (C) are *characteristics* of different eye structures, the *reason* for the variations is directly tied to what the organism *needs* to see.  Complexity (D) is a *result* of the needs, not the driving factor itself.



"
根据这段文字，哪个关于锡克教的描述没有准确描绘这个宗教？,"The correct answer is **B: 古鲁是锡克教特有的基本组成部分**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""古鲁是所有印度宗教的基本组成部分，但在锡克教中地位特别高..."". This means gurus are *not* unique to Sikhism, but are found in other Indian religions as well. While extremely important in Sikhism, they aren't exclusive to it.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: 锡克教是印度教传统内部分裂的结果** - The text explicitly states Sikhism originated from a split within the Hindu tradition.
*   **C: 在这个宗教的创始人古鲁·纳纳克之后，有九位古鲁** - The passage confirms Guru Nanak founded the religion and was followed by nine more Gurus.
*   **D: 锡克教的某些传统根植于印度教** - The text states Sikhs believe their religion is distinct from Hinduism *but* acknowledge its origins and inclusion of Hindu traditions.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪个是被认为是锡克教信仰体系的核心方面？,"The correct answer is **A: 古鲁的概念 (The concept of the Guru)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""但在锡克教中地位特别高，成为了锡克教信仰的核心 (but holds a particularly high place in Sikhism and is central to Sikh belief)."" This directly links the concept of the Guru to the core of the Sikh faith.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 印度教传统 (Hindu traditions):** While the passage acknowledges Sikhism *originates* from Hinduism and *includes* Hindu traditions, it doesn't state these traditions are central to the faith itself.
* **C: 拒绝承认其他印度宗教 (Rejecting other Indian religions):** The passage states Sikhs *consider their religion distinct* from Hinduism, but doesn't mention a rejection of other Indian religions.
* **D: 说旁遮普语 (Speaking Punjabi):** While Gurmat is *in* Punjabi, speaking the language isn't presented as a core tenet of the belief system.



"
根据这段文章，患有注意力缺失症的孩子可能很难专心做什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 学校作业**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""患有多动症的孩子很难专心做事，例如做作业..."" (Children with ADHD have difficulty concentrating on things like homework...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 玩游戏** - The passage specifically says they *can* focus on things they enjoy, like games.
*   **C: 看卡通片** - Same as above, they can focus on cartoons they like.
*   **D: 他们喜欢做的事情** - The passage states they *can* concentrate on things they enjoy.



"
根据这段文章，为什么患有注意力缺失症的孩子往往会从事冒险行为？,"The correct answer is **D: 为了刺激他们的大脑** (To stimulate their brains).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""因为正常的方法无法刺激他们的大脑，为了刺激大脑，他们“做出危险行为、打架、挑战权威”.""  This directly links risky behavior to the need for brain stimulation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 为了减轻多动症状** - While risky behavior might *result* from hyperactivity, the passage doesn't say it's done *to alleviate* the symptoms.
*   **B: 为了帮助他们与同龄人建立联系** - The passage states the opposite: ADD *impacts* relationships because others don't understand their behavior.
*   **C: 为了引起父母的注意** - The passage doesn't mention seeking parental attention as a motivation.



"
根据这段文字中的信息，哪个不是支架式教学的例子？,"The correct answer is **C: 一个独立学习计划**.

Here's why:

* **The passage defines scaffolding as support for someone *learning* something new.** It specifically mentions helping people use new computer programs or start new projects. Scaffolding provides guidance, prompts, and explanations.

Let's look at why the other options *are* examples of scaffolding:

* **A: 一个电脑游戏开始时的教程 (A computer game's initial tutorial):**  This directly provides instruction and guidance on how to use the game – scaffolding for a new program/activity.
* **B: SAT辅导员 (An SAT tutor):** A tutor offers help, explanation, and strategies to learn the material – scaffolding.
* **D: 一个小型联盟教练 (A little league coach):** A coach provides instruction and guidance on how to play a sport – scaffolding.

* **C: 一个独立学习计划 (An independent study plan):** This is the opposite of scaffolding. It *removes* support and requires the learner to figure things out on their own.  It lacks the guidance and assistance described in the passage as essential to scaffolding.



"
以下哪个没有准确描述支架式教学的概念？,"The correct answer is **C: It is also known as project-based learning.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""支架式教学不是一种学习方法，而是一种辅助..."" (Scaffolding is *not* a learning method, but a means of assistance...). It then *contrasts* it with project-based learning (""虽然项目学习法...但支架式学习法却更进一步。""- While project-based learning...scaffolding goes further).  Therefore, scaffolding is *different* from project-based learning, not the same.

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurate according to the text:

* **A: 支架式教学可以在线上进行** (Scaffolding can be done online) - The passage says ""支架式教学可以线上或线下进行"" (Scaffolding can be done online or offline).
* **B: 它更像是一种辅助而非学习方法** (It's more of an aid than a learning method) - The passage directly states this.
* **D: 支架式教学被用来在学习经验开始时提供支持** (Scaffolding is used to provide support at the beginning of a learning experience) - The passage describes it as helping people ""刚学习使用新电脑程序或启动新项目"" (just learning to use a new computer program or start a new project).



"
根据这段文字，MySpace 的哪项功能可以让阅读有困难的学生受益？,"The correct answer is **C: 一个网址**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that a single URL is ""easier to remember and type for students who struggle with a keyboard or spelling.""  This directly addresses students with reading difficulties as well – remembering and typing a short URL is easier than complex instructions or longer web addresses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 个性化设置 (Personalization settings):** While the text mentions personalization for *reading* and color preferences, it doesn't directly link this to helping students *with* reading difficulties specifically. It's a broader benefit.
* **B: 博客 (Blogs):** Blogs are a feature of the site, but the text doesn't say they help students who struggle with reading.
* **D: 5400 万个注册帐号 (54 million registered accounts):** This is simply a statistic about the website's popularity and doesn't relate to how it helps students.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不是赫鲁晓夫对工人暴动的回应的一部分？,"The correct answer is **C: 加大减薪力度 (Increase the severity of pay cuts)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...赫鲁晓夫对一些经济要求做出了让步 (Khrushchev made concessions on some economic demands)..."" This means he *didn't* increase pay cuts, he lessened them.
* **The passage also states:**
    * **A: 任命一位新总理 (Appoint a new Prime Minister):** ""...并同意任命受民众欢迎的瓦迪斯瓦夫·哥穆尔卡 (Wladyslaw Gomulka) 为新总理 (and agreed to appoint the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new Prime Minister).""
    * **B: 动用坦克恢复秩序 (Deploy tanks to restore order):** ""...赫鲁晓夫派出坦克恢复了秩序 (Khrushchev sent tanks to restore order).""
    * **D: 承认一些经济要求 (Acknowledged some economic demands):**  As mentioned above, concessions were made.

Therefore, increasing pay cuts is the *only* option not mentioned as a response by Khrushchev.



"
以下哪项不是波兰骚乱的原因之一？,"The correct answer is **D: 任命瓦迪斯瓦夫·哥穆尔卡 (Appointment of Wladyslaw Gomulka)**.

The passage states that Gomulka was *appointed* as a result of the protests, not a *cause* of them. The other options – communism, food shortages, and pay cuts – are explicitly listed as reasons for the unrest.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项没有影响到苏联和美国之间的关系？,"The correct answer is **B: 对德国的看法 (Views on Germany)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states** that being ""common enemies with Germany"" *promoted* cooperation between the Soviet Union and the US.  Therefore, their shared view of Germany as an enemy was a factor *bringing them together*, not driving them apart.

Let's look at why the other options *did* affect their relationship:

* **A: 文化差异 (Cultural differences)** - The passage mentions ""cultural clashes"" as contributing to the breakdown of the alliance.
* **C: 相反的进程 (Opposing processes)** - The passage mentions ""procedural"" conflicts as a reason for the divide.
* **D: 关于制度的争议 (Disputes about systems/institutions)** -  The passage specifically lists ""institutional"" conflicts.



"
以下哪项不能准确描述神经脉冲在全身传送的目的？,"The correct answer is **A: 减缓血液流动 (Slow down blood flow)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the nervous system keeps blood flow *smooth* (顺畅).**  Slowing down blood flow is the opposite of keeping it smooth and is not a purpose mentioned or implied.
* **B: 管理血液流动 (Manage blood flow)** - The passage says the nervous system maintains blood flow, implying management.
* **C: 维持体内平衡 (Maintain internal balance)** - This is *directly* stated in the passage.
* **D: 让身体免受潜在威胁 (Protect the body from potential threats)** -  The passage states pulses allow the body to avoid threats.

Therefore, slowing down blood flow is the one option that *doesn't* align with the information given.



"
在吉萨高原上可以发现什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 庙宇**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""埃及死亡之谷的吉萨（Giza）高原（即“吉萨金字塔群”）包括多个金字塔…几个**庙宇**和大狮身人面像。""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 坟墓:** While the passage mentions ""several small tombs,"" it doesn't say *only* tombs are found there.
*   **C: 所有七大奇迹:** The passage explicitly states the Great Pyramid is the *only* one of the Seven Wonders still standing.
*   **D: 大金字塔:** The Great Pyramid *is* on the Giza Plateau, but the passage states there are *multiple* things there, not just the pyramid itself.



"
大金字塔的目的是什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 为了向法老表示敬意 (To show respect to the pharaoh)**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states the pyramids were ""众多向已故法老表示敬意的大型金字塔的其中之一"" (among the many large pyramids to show respect to the deceased pharaoh).
* It also mentions the Great Pyramid was built ""为纪念胡夫法老"" (to commemorate Pharaoh Khufu).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 成为世界七大奇迹之一 (To be one of the seven wonders of the world)** - This is a *result* of its impressive nature, not its original *purpose*.
* **C: 作为地标 (As a landmark)** - While it *is* a landmark now, that wasn't its initial intent.
* **D: 为了存放逝者的坟墓 (To store the tombs of the deceased)** - It does contain a tomb, but the primary purpose was the honor and remembrance of the pharaoh, with the tomb being *part* of that.



"
我们对于摧毁神庙的纵火犯的认知来源于谁？,"The correct answer is **C: 斯特拉博 (Strabo)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""希腊历史学家斯特拉博 (Strabo) 后来提到了这个名字，也就是我们今天所熟知的名字。"" (Greek historian Strabo later mentioned the name, which is the name we know today.) This directly indicates that our knowledge of the arsonist's name comes from Strabo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 以弗所人 (The Ephesians):** While the Ephesians were angered by the arson and declared his name infamous, the passage doesn't say they *provided* our current knowledge of his name. They just reacted to the event.
*   **B: 亚历山大大帝 (Alexander the Great):** Alexander offered to rebuild the temple, but wasn't the source of information about the arsonist.
*   **D: 阿尔忒弥斯 (Artemis):** Artemis was the goddess the temple was dedicated to, she wouldn't be a source of information about the arsonist.



"
关于阿尔忒弥斯神庙的重建，哪项陈述是准确的？,"The correct answer is **B: It was rebuilt after the reign of Alexander the Great.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC, following Alexander’s death."" This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Reconstruction was funded by Alexander the Great:** The passage says he *offered* to fund it, but his offer was *rejected*.
* **C: Herostratus was ordered to pay for the reconstruction:** The passage doesn't mention anything about Herostratus being involved in the rebuilding process financially. He was simply infamous for the destruction.
* **D: It was rebuilt in 320 BC:** The passage specifically states it was rebuilt in **323 BC**.



"
根据这段文字，一个物种可能最早用双腿行走是在什么时候？,"The correct answer is **A: 700 万年前**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""乍得沙赫人（Sahelanthropus）可能早在 700 万年前就已经用双腿行走了。"" This directly answers the question about the earliest possible time a species might have walked on two legs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 200 万年前** - This is when *Homo Erectus* started walking upright, not the earliest possible time.
*   **C: 390 万年前** - This is when evidence of bipedal adaptation was found in *Australopithecus*, but potentially *later* than *Sahelanthropus*.
*   **D: 420 万年前** - Similar to C, this relates to *Australopithecus* and is not the earliest mentioned.



"
以下哪个物种经常用两只脚行走？,"The correct answer is **B: 直立人 (Homo Erectus)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""200万年前，随着直立人（Homo Erectus，意思是直立的人）的出现，人类开始直立行走。"" (2 million years ago, with the emergence of *Homo Erectus*, humans began to walk upright.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 乍得沙赫人 (Sahelanthropus):** The passage says they *may* have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago, but it's not a certainty and doesn't state they *frequently* did.
* **C: 双足特化 (Bipedal specialization):** This is a *characteristic* of walking on two feet, not a species itself.
* **D: 南方古猿 (Australopithecus):** The passage states their ancestors didn't habitually walk upright, although evidence of bipedal adaptation was found in their fossils.



"
二战期间德国海军想要实现什么目标？,"The correct answer is **B: 防止英国接收人员和货物 (Prevent Britain from receiving personnel and goods)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...以 U 型潜艇为主力的德国海军试图拦截这场运输 (German Navy, primarily with U-boats, attempted to intercept this shipping).""  This ""shipping"" refers to the personnel and goods the Americans were sending *to Britain*. Therefore, the German Navy's goal was to prevent Britain from *receiving* these supplies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 拦截来自英国的货物 (Intercept goods from Britain):** The passage focuses on what the Germans were trying to stop *going to* Britain, not coming from it.
* **C: 横跨大西洋运输物资 (Transport goods across the Atlantic):** This was what the *Americans* were doing, not the Germans.
* **D: 防止美国接收人员和物资 (Prevent the US from receiving personnel and goods):** The passage states the Americans were sending aid *to* Britain, not receiving it.



"
根据文中的信息，在北大西洋战役期间，谁在海战中取得了最大的成功？,"The correct answer is **A: 英国人和美国人**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Americans were *attempting* to transport personnel and supplies to *help* Britain. It then states that *if the Allies had failed*, Germany would likely have conquered Britain. This implies that the Allies (Britain and America) ultimately *succeeded* in their efforts, and therefore achieved the greatest success in the battle. While the German U-boats *tried* to intercept the transport, the passage highlights the importance of the Allied success in preventing that.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 德国人** - The passage implies Germany *failed* in its objective.
* **C: 德国人和英国人** - The passage focuses on the potential downfall of Britain if Germany had succeeded, not a shared success.
* **D: 英国人** - While Britain was the recipient of aid and a key player, the *Americans* were also actively involved in the transport effort and crucial to the success. The passage mentions them together as Allies.



"
当亚述人开始使用骑兵时，以下哪个是不存在的？,"The correct answer is **A: 马鞍 (Saddle)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""当时尚未发明马鞍，因此亚述骑兵只能骑在光秃秃的马背上作战。"" (At that time, saddles had not yet been invented, so Assyrian cavalry could only fight on bare horsebacks.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 十字弓 (Crossbow)** - The passage states the Assyrians used ""致命的十字弓"" (deadly crossbows).
*   **C: 战车 (Chariots)** - The passage begins by discussing how the invention of the spoked wheel improved Assyrian chariots.
*   **D: 盔甲 (Armor)** - The passage mentions the Assyrian arrows could penetrate enemy armor.



"
使用骑兵的战斗通常是如何进行的？,"The correct answer is **C: 骑马 (riding horses)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""骑兵是指在马背上作战的军队"" (Cavalry refers to armies that fight on horseback).  The question asks how battles using cavalry *typically* proceed.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 徒步 (walking)** - Cavalry, by definition, does *not* fight on foot.
* **B: 没有盔甲 (without armor)** - The passage mentions enemies *having* armor that the Assyrians could penetrate, but doesn't say anything about cavalry fighting without armor.
* **D: 士兵数量较少 (fewer soldiers)** - The passage doesn't relate cavalry use to soldier numbers.



"
根据这段文字，普通的巴比伦人不可能出现在哪里？,"The correct answer is **D: 在内殿里献祭 (In the inner sanctuary to make offerings)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that the inner sanctuary (内殿) was a place ""only priests could enter."" This means ordinary Babylonians were not allowed inside.
* The text mentions people making offerings to gods, participating in rituals and festivals, and accessing the outer courtyard – all things a regular Babylonian could do.

Therefore, option D is the only place described as being inaccessible to ordinary people."
以下哪项是专门为祭司准备的？,"The correct answer is **B: 内殿 (Inner sanctuary)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""每所神殿都有一处对外开放的庭院，以及一处**只有祭司才能进入的内殿**。"" (Every temple had an open courtyard and an **inner sanctuary accessible only to priests**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 节庆 (Festivals)** - The passage says festivals were *for* the gods, not restricted to priests.
*   **C: 仪式 (Rituals)** -  Rituals were performed *by* priests, but not a place specifically *for* them. They were done to appease the gods.
*   **D: 金字形神塔 (Ziggurats)** - The passage states the top of the ziggurat was a special holy place *for the god*, not exclusively for priests.



"
图坦卡蒙国王何时引起了轰动？,"The correct answer is **C: 在他的坟墓被发现之后** (In after his tomb was discovered).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""However, his tomb was discovered in 1922, making him a celebrity."" This directly links his fame to the discovery of his tomb.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 在他的坟墓被盗之后** (After his tomb was robbed) - The passage specifically says his tomb was *not* robbed, which is why the contents were so well-preserved.
*   **B: 在他的统治期间** (During his reign) - The passage states he wasn't considered important *during* his time.
*   **D: 在古代国王名单上被提及之后** (After being mentioned on lists of ancient kings) - He wasn't included on most lists of ancient kings.



"
是什么使图坦卡蒙国王成为著名的埃及国王之一？,"The correct answer is **A: His unlooted tomb was discovered.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous."" and ""Although many past tombs had been looted, this tomb was almost intact."" This highlights that the discovery of his largely undisturbed tomb and its contents are what brought him fame.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He in ancient king lists** - The passage says he *wasn't* considered important and *not* listed in most ancient king lists.
* **C: His tomb was looted and lost thousands of artifacts** - The opposite is true; his tomb was *unlooted* and *contained* thousands of artifacts.
* **D: His importance in ancient Egyptian times** - The passage states he wasn't considered important in ancient times.



"
希腊诗人荷马无法做什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 看 (See)**.

The passage states that Homer was a ""blind poet."" Therefore, he could not see.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 听 (Hear):** Being blind doesn't necessarily affect someone's hearing.
*   **C: 走 (Walk):** There's no information in the passage to suggest he couldn't walk.
*   **D: 说 (Speak):** As a poet, Homer clearly *could* speak (or recite his poems).



"
以下哪个著名的希腊人以其他方面而不是文学而闻名？,"The correct answer is **C: 毕达哥拉斯 (Pythagoras)**.

Here's why:

* **荷马 (Homer)**, 索福克勒斯 (Sophocles), and 阿里斯托芬 (Aristophanes) are all mentioned as writers/playwrights – famous for their *literary* works.
* **毕达哥拉斯 (Pythagoras)** is specifically identified as a *mathematician* and known for his theorem, a mathematical concept, not a literary one.

The question asks for the famous Greek person known for something *other than* literature, making Pythagoras the correct choice."
希伯来家庭经常在哪里度过大部分时间？,"The correct answer is **A: In the outdoors**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""希伯来家庭的生活大多是在户外度过的。"" (Hebrew families mostly lived outdoors.)

While they did cook in the courtyard (C) and shops were open to the street (B), the overarching point is that life *generally* happened outdoors.  The passage also implies houses weren't central to their lives (D). Therefore, ""in the outdoors"" is the most encompassing and accurate answer."
希伯来家庭认为什么不是很重要的？,"The correct answer is **C: 他们的房子 (Their houses)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""在 中东温暖的气候中，房子并不是多重要 (In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not very important)."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 他们的气候 (Their climate)** - The passage *says* the climate contributes to houses not being important, but doesn't say the climate itself is unimportant.
* **B: 他们的商店 (Their stores)** - The passage describes the *nature* of the stores (open counters), but doesn't say they are unimportant.
* **D: 他们的烹饪 (Their cooking)** - The passage mentions women cooking, but doesn't state that cooking is unimportant.



"
以下哪项不被描述为斯堪的纳维亚国家之间的差异？,"The correct answer is **B: 土地**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states differences exist between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland in terms of:

*   **历史 (History)** - ""history之间存在许多差异""
*   **习俗 (Customs)** - ""习俗之间存在许多差异""
*   **民众 (People)** - ""民众之间存在许多差异""

The passage does *not* mention differences in *land* (土地) between these countries. While their landscapes are diverse, the text focuses on cultural and societal distinctions.



"
谁最先在格陵兰岛定居？,"The correct answer is **A: 爱斯基摩部落 (Eskimo tribes)**.

The passage states: ""不管他有没有发现，爱斯基摩人当时已经在那里生活了。"" (Regardless of whether he discovered it, the Eskimos were already living there at the time.) This clearly indicates that Eskimo tribes were the first inhabitants of Greenland.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 挪威人 (Norwegians):** The passage mentions Scandinavian countries generally, but doesn't specifically state Norwegians were the first settlers.
*   **C: 红胡子埃里克 (Red Erik):** The passage states he *discovered* the land (potentially), but *after* Eskimos were already living there.
*   **D: 瑞典人 (Swedes):** The passage doesn't mention Swedes settling Greenland.



"
哪个团体更喜欢在没有椅子的情况下用餐？,"The correct answer is **C: 富有的罗马男人** (Wealthy Roman men).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""富人则喜欢聚在一起举行宴会，侧卧着吃饭"" (The wealthy preferred to gather for banquets and eat reclining).  This directly means wealthy men (as they were the dominant group in Roman society and would have hosted/attended these banquets) ate without chairs, *reclining* instead.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 富有的罗马女人** (Wealthy Roman women): The passage doesn't specify wealthy women's preference.
*   **B: 贫穷的罗马男人** (Poor Roman men): The passage states the *poor* sat on chairs.
*   **D: 贫穷的罗马女人** (Poor Roman women): The passage states the *poor* sat on chairs.



"
以下哪项不会是古罗马宴会的一部分？,"The correct answer is **D: 一盘烤火鸡 (A platter of roasted turkey)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that turkeys were *not* eaten by ancient Romans – they came to Europe centuries later from the Americas.

Let's look at why the other options *would* be part of a Roman banquet:

*   **A: 坐在椅子上用餐的贫穷客人 (Poor guests dining on chairs)** – The passage says poor people *did* eat while seated.
*   **B: 蜗牛开胃菜 (Snail appetizers)** – The passage lists snails as one of the unusual dishes Romans ate.
*   **C: 晚餐期间躺着的富有男人 (Wealthy men reclining during dinner)** – The passage states wealthy Romans preferred to dine while reclining.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不太可能产生持久的影响？,"The correct answer is **B: 一种少数民族文化**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""少数民族文化常常没有留下相关的历史证据就消失无踪，而且不被当做是像样的文明"" (Minority cultures often disappear without leaving related historical evidence and are not considered proper civilizations). This directly indicates that minority cultures are *less likely* to have a lasting impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 一个社会 (A society):** The passage *defines* civilization as stemming from a society (""文明是一种由共同生活、合作工作的人群（社会）所共享的单一文化"").  Societies are fundamental to the concept of civilization.
*   **C: 一个城邦 (A city-state):** The passage states that ""城邦是民族的前身"" (City-states are precursors to nations), suggesting they played a role in the development of civilizations.
*   **D: 一种文明型文化 (A civilization-type culture):** The passage describes ""文明型文化"" as having characteristics of lasting influence: ""知识的代代相传，文化的足迹萦绕留存，还有文化能够公平地传播"" (passing down knowledge from generation to generation, the trace of culture lingering, and culture being able to spread equitably).



"
根据这段文字，民族的前身是什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 一个城邦**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**城邦是民族的前身**"" (City-states were the precursors to nations). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 一种文明型文化** - While related to the concept, the passage states city-states *precede* nations, not that they *are* a civilization-type culture.
* **B: 一种单一文化** -  A single culture is *shared* within a civilization, but isn't the predecessor to a nation.
* **D: 一种少数民族文化** - The passage specifically states minority cultures often disappear *without becoming* established civilizations.



"
关于朱克杰宗的哪个说法是不正确的？,"The correct answer is **A: 它是为了庆祝藏蒙军队的胜利而建造的 (It was built to celebrate the victory of the Tibetan-Mongol armies)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Dzong was built to *commemorate* Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel's **victory *over*** the Tibetan-Mongol armies, not to celebrate the armies themselves. This is a key difference in meaning.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **B: 它位于不丹 (It is located in Bhutan)** - The passage states it's in the Paro district, which is in Bhutan.
*   **C: 火灾毁坏了这座堡垒的许多遗迹 (The fire destroyed many of the ruins of the fortress)** - The passage explicitly states a fire left only remnants like the statue of Zhabdrung.
*   **D: 它是由扎布隆·阿旺·纳姆耶尔创造的 (It was created by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel)** - The passage states Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built it in 1649.



"
以下哪项陈述准确描述了朱克杰宗的火灾结果？,"The correct answer is **A: 唯一留下的遗迹是扎布隆·阿旺·纳姆格亚尔的雕像** (Only the statue of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal remained).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""1951 年，一场大火导致杜克耶堡仅存一丝遗迹，例如扎布隆·阿旺·纳姆格亚尔（Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel）的雕像。"" (In 1951, a fire left only remnants of Drukgyal Dzong, such as the statue of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 藏蒙军队获胜** (The Tibetan-Mongol armies won) - The passage says the fortress was *built to commemorate a victory* *over* them, not their victory.
* **C: 景点的受欢迎程度未受影响** (The popularity of the attraction was not affected) - The passage says it *became* one of the most prominent attractions *after* the fire, implying its popularity increased *because* of the remaining ruins and subsequent preservation.
* **D: 它被扎布隆·阿旺·纳姆格亚尔保护** (It was protected by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal) - He *built* it, but the passage states it was *maintained and preserved* after the fire, not protected by him at that time.



"
以下关于柬埔寨的哪项陈述是正确的？,"The correct answer is **D: 泰国人摧毁了金边**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""泰国人在 18 世纪曾多次入侵柬埔寨，并在 1772 年摧毁了金边."" (Thai people invaded Cambodia many times in the 18th century, and destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 越南人摧毁了金边** - The passage states Vietnamese invaded *later* in the 18th century, but doesn't say they destroyed Phnom Penh.
* **B: 柬埔寨在 1772 年入侵了泰国** - The passage states Thailand invaded Cambodia.
* **C: 柬埔寨在 18 世纪初期被越南入侵** - The passage states Vietnamese invasions happened *towards the end* of the 18th century.
"
以下哪项陈述准确描述了柬埔寨的入侵？,"The correct answer is **D: 泰国人多次入侵柬埔寨**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""泰国人在 18 世纪曾多次入侵柬埔寨，并在 1772 年摧毁了金边。"" (Thai people invaded Cambodia many times in the 18th century, and destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 越南人多次入侵柬埔寨** (Vietnamese people invaded Cambodia many times) - The passage states Vietnamese invaded *in the last years* of the century, not necessarily multiple times.
* **B: 泰国人和越南人在 1772 年入侵柬埔寨** (Thai and Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in 1772) - Only the Thai are mentioned as invading in 1772.
* **C: 越南人摧毁了金边** (Vietnamese destroyed Phnom Penh) - The passage states the *Thai* destroyed Phnom Penh.



"
以下哪项活动是荷兰东印度公司在台湾时期没有进行的？,"The correct answer is **D: 愿意把台湾控制权让给清朝 (willing to hand over control of Taiwan to the Qing Dynasty)**.

Here's why:

* **A: 在岛的西南部建立基地 (Establishing a base in the southwest of the island)** - The passage explicitly states the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan in 1624.
* **B: 从事原住民粮食生产 (Engaging in indigenous grain production)** - The passage states the Dutch *changed* the original inhabitants' methods of food production.
* **C: 在种植园雇佣华工 (Employing Chinese laborers in plantations)** - The passage says the Dutch hired Chinese workers for their rice and sugarcane plantations.
* **D: 愿意把台湾控制权让给清朝 (willing to hand over control of Taiwan to the Qing Dynasty)** - The passage does *not* mention the Dutch willingly giving up control.  They were eventually displaced by the Qing Dynasty forces in 1683.

Therefore, the activity the Dutch did *not* do is offering to relinquish control to the Qing Dynasty."
《马关条约》确立了什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 日本对台湾的管辖权 (Japan's control over Taiwan)**.

The passage specifically states that the Treaty of Maguan (马关条约) resulted in the Qing government ceding sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan. This means Japan gained control of Taiwan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 日本在第一次中日战争中战败 (Japan was defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War)** - The passage states the Qing *lost* the war, leading to the treaty.
* **B: 台湾作为清朝省份的地位 (Taiwan's status as a Qing province)** - The treaty *ended* Taiwan's status as a Qing province.
* **C: 台湾有能力夺回对其沿海地区的控制权 (Taiwan's ability to regain control over its coastal regions)** - The passage doesn't discuss Taiwan's ability to regain control, only the loss of control to Japan.



"
化学物质的pH值是如何测量的？,"The correct answer is **C: 化学物质中的氢离子数量** (The number of hydrogen ions in a chemical substance).

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""pH 值以被测化学品中的氢（pH 中的 H）离子数量表示。"" (pH is represented by the number of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the chemical being tested.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 化学物质的酸碱性如何** (How acidic or basic a chemical is) - While pH *indicates* acidity or alkalinity, it's not *how* it's measured. It's what the measurement *represents*.
* **B: 化学物质中有多少质子** (How many protons are in a chemical substance) -  Protons are related to hydrogen ions, but pH specifically refers to the *number of hydrogen ions*, not just protons generally present.
* **D: 化学物质中有多少电子** (How many electrons are in a chemical substance) - The passage clarifies that hydrogen ions are protons *that have lost electrons*.  The number of electrons isn't directly what pH measures.



"
氢离子中的什么被去除？,"The correct answer is **D: 电子**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""氢离子是失去了电子的质子（因为氢原子由一个质子和一个电子组成）。""  This directly translates to ""Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost an electron (because a hydrogen atom consists of a proton and an electron).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 质子 (Proton)** -  While a hydrogen ion *is* a proton, the question asks what is *removed* to create it.
*   **B: pH值 (pH value)** - pH value is a *measure* of hydrogen ions, not something removed from them.
*   **C: 碱性 (Alkalinity/Basicity)** - Basicity is a property related to pH, but not something physically removed from a hydrogen ion.

以下哪项陈述没有准确地描述狮群？,"The correct answer is **C: 雄性和雌性都有密切关系**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""作为大家庭里的姐妹和女儿，雌性之间通常彼此关系密切。"" (As members of a large family, females are usually closely related to each other.)  It *doesn't* say males and females have close relationships. It implies the males are related to *each other* but doesn't address their relationships with the females.

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct based on the passage:

* **A: 它们的行为类似于狗群** -  ""狮群的行为与狼群或狗群非常类似。"" (The behavior of prides is very similar to that of wolf packs or dog packs.)
* **B: 雄性与雌性的比例不均** - ""狮群由一到三只有亲属关系的成年雄性，以及可多达三十只的雌性和幼崽组成。"" (A pride consists of one to three related adult males, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.) This clearly shows a significant difference in numbers.
* **D: 它们既致命又具有群居属性** - The passage states they are ""群居属性最明显的猫科动物"" (the most social of the cat family) and that their behavior is ""非常致命的"" (very deadly to their prey).



"
以下哪项陈述没有准确地描述狮子的行为？,"The correct answer is **D: 它们的行为类似于其他大型猫科动物**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that lion behavior is *unlike* other large cats: ""...and these behaviors are remarkably fatal to their prey, **but unlike other large cats**."" 

Let's look at why the other options are correct, according to the passage:

*   **A: 它们非常具有群居属性** - The passage begins by stating lions are the most social of the big cats and live in groups.
*   **B: 它们的行为类似于狼群** - The passage directly compares lion behavior to that of wolf packs and dog packs.
*   **C: 雄性和雌性对猎物都非常致命** - The passage states the behaviors are ""remarkably fatal to their prey,"" and implies both genders participate in these behaviors as part of the pride.



"
兔子是哪种捕食者的常见猎物？,"The correct answer is **C: 中型猫科动物**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""它们的下方是更多中等大小的猫科动物，它们吃的是中等大小的猎物，从兔子、羚羊到鹿都会吃。"" This directly links rabbits to medium-sized cats as prey.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 小型猫科动物** - The passage says small cats eat insects, rodents, lizards, and birds - not rabbits.
*   **B: 大型猫科动物** - The passage doesn't mention large cats eating rabbits.
*   **D: 羚羊** - Antelope are *prey* of the medium-sized cats, not predators of rabbits.



"
较小的猫科动物通常捕食以下哪些动物？,"The correct answer is **A: 啮齿动物**.

The passage specifically states that smaller cats eat ""昆虫、啮齿动物、蜥蜴和鸟类等数量多得多的小型猎物"" (insects, rodents, lizards and birds, etc. - much more numerous small prey). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 兔子** - Rabbits are mentioned as prey for *medium*-sized cats.
* **C: 羚羊** - Antelope are also prey for *medium*-sized cats.
* **D: 鹿** - Deer are also prey for *medium*-sized cats.



"
以下哪项不是豹猫的捕食方法之一？,"The correct answer is **D: 只捕食体型较小的动物**.

Here's why:

* **A: 融入到周围环境中** - The passage states ""豹猫的捕食方式是先融入周围环境..."" (Leopard cats hunt by first blending into their surroundings...)
* **B: 追踪猎物的气味** - The passage says they track prey ""通过气味和嗅探猎物在地面上的踪迹"" (by scent and sniffing for prey tracks on the ground).
* **C: 在夜间追踪猎物** - The passage mentions ""它们的夜视能力很强，能在黑暗中看得很清楚"" (they have strong night vision and can see clearly in the dark). This implies they hunt at night.
* **D: 只捕食体型较小的动物** - While the passage *states* their prey is *usually* smaller, it doesn't describe this as a *method* of hunting. It's a *result* of their hunting capabilities, not *how* they hunt.

Therefore, option D is a characteristic of *what* they eat, not *how* they hunt."
以下哪项没有准确地描述豹猫？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 它们嗅觉较弱 (They have a weak sense of smell)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""科学家认为，美洲豹猫是通过气味和嗅探猎物在地面上的踪迹来跟踪和寻找要捕食的动物的 (Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate animals to prey on by scent and sniffing at traces of prey on the ground)."" This directly contradicts the idea that they have a weak sense of smell.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: 它们善于在夜间捕食 (They are good at hunting at night):**  The passage says ""它们的夜视能力很强，能在黑暗中看得很清楚 (They have very good night vision and can see clearly in the dark).""
* **B: 它们行动隐秘 (They are stealthy):** The passage states ""而且行动也很隐秘 (and are also very stealthy).""
* **D: 它们喜欢捕食小动物 (They like to prey on small animals):** The passage begins with ""豹猫喜欢吃小动物 (Ocelots like to eat small animals).""



"
以下哪项不被认为是老虎的最大优势？,"The correct answer is **B: 攀爬**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""它会攀爬（虽然攀爬能力不是很强）"" - ""It can climb (although its climbing ability isn't very strong)."" This indicates that climbing is *not* a major strength of the tiger.

The passage highlights:

*   **拉力 (Pulling Strength):** is five times that of human strongmen - a significant advantage.
*   **跳远 (Long Jump):** is listed as one of its abilities, implying competence.
*   **咆哮 (Roaring):** is a characteristic unique to tigers, lions, leopards, and jaguars.

Therefore, climbing is the least emphasized and explicitly noted as a weakness, making it the answer."
根据这段文字，老虎和狮子之间有什么区别？,"The correct answer is **B: 它们咆哮的声音 (Their roar sounds)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""老虎的咆哮不像狮子的咆哮那样深沉，而更像一句生气嘶吼的话语 (The tiger's roar is not as deep as the lion's roar, but more like an angry hiss).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 它们的游泳能力 (Their swimming ability):** The text states tigers *can* swim, but doesn't compare their swimming ability to lions.
*   **C: 它们的跳跃距离 (Their jumping distance):** The text mentions tigers can jump, but doesn't compare it to lions.
*   **D: 它们拉扯的力量 (Their pulling strength):** The text only mentions the tiger's pulling strength relative to humans, not lions.



"
根据这段文字，罗伯特·胡克在其他生物学家之前做了什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 观察死亡细胞**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""他是第一个观察死亡细胞的人"" (He was the first person to observe dead cells). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 使用显微镜观察生物体:** While Hooke *used* a microscope, the text doesn't say he was the first to do so generally for all living things.
* **C: 观察小方块:** He observed small boxes, but the important thing is *what* those boxes were - dead cells.
* **D: 发现了生物体的最小功能单位:** The text states cells *are* the smallest functional units, but it doesn't say Hooke *discovered* this fact. He simply observed the structures that would later be understood as cells.



"
“细胞”一词的起源是什么意思？,"The correct answer is **B: 小房间**.

The passage states: ""Cell（细胞）一词源自拉丁语cella（意思是小房间）."" This directly answers the question.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 小方块** - While Hooke *saw* small squares, that's not the *meaning* of the word ""cell.""
*   **C: 小结构** - This is a description of what a cell *is*, but not the origin of the *word* itself.
*   **D: 小球** - The passage mentions cells appearing as small squares or spheres, but the origin of the word is not related to ""small spheres""."
根据这段文字，大多数动物都具有什么能力？,"The correct answer is **B: 移动 (Moving)**.

The text explicitly states: ""大部分动物都能移动 (Most animals are able to move)."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 飞行 (Flying):** The text says *some* animals fly, but not *most*.
* **C: 游泳 (Swimming):** The text says *some* animals swim, but not *most*.
* **D: 挖掘 (Digging):** The text says *some* animals dig, but not *most*.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项是某些动物所没有的？,"The correct answer is **C: 脑**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""只有动物有脑（但也不是所有动物都有，比如水母就没有脑）"" which translates to ""Only animals have brains (but not all animals have them, for example, jellyfish do not have brains).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 细胞 (Cells):** The passage says ""动物由许多细胞组成"" (Animals are composed of many cells), meaning *all* animals have cells.
*   **B: 消化能力 (Digestion ability):** The passage states ""动物吃了食物后会在体内将其消化"" (Animals digest food after eating it), meaning *all* animals have the ability to digest food.
*   **D: 进食能力 (Eating ability):** The passage implies animals eat (""动物吃了食物"") and therefore have the ability to eat.

Therefore, the only thing *some* animals lack, according to the text, is a brain.



"
是什么帮助植物进行光合作用？,"The correct answer is **D: 阳光**.

The passage explicitly states: ""植物通过光合作用从阳光中获取养分。"" (Plants obtain nutrients from sunlight through photosynthesis.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 阴影 (Shadow)** - The passage states plants *provide* shade, not that they need it for photosynthesis.
*   **B: 动物 (Animals)** - The passage says animals *need* plants, not that plants need animals for photosynthesis.
*   **C: 食物 (Food)** - While we get food *from* plants, the passage states plants get nutrients *from* sunlight.



"
人类呼出的是植物吸入的什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 二氧化碳**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""植物能...吸收人类呼出的二氧化碳"" which translates to ""Plants...absorb the carbon dioxide humans exhale.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 食物 (Food)** - Humans eat plants, they don't exhale food.
*   **B: 氧气 (Oxygen)** - Humans inhale oxygen, they exhale carbon dioxide.
*   **C: 水 (Water)** - While humans exhale some water vapor, carbon dioxide is the primary gas plants absorb from human breath.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪个例子会阻碍进化过程？,"The correct answer is **A: 一个小种群在新环境中无法生存**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explains that speciation (the formation of new species) happens *when* a small group separates and adapts to a *different* environment.**  If the small group cannot survive in the new environment, there's no adaptation, no divergence, and therefore no speciation – the process stops before it can begin.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 部分种群移居到新环境 (Part of a population migrates to a new environment)** - This is the *starting point* of the speciation process described in the passage. It's necessary for evolution to occur.
* **C: 种群在新环境中调整其适应能力 (A population adjusts its adaptations in a new environment)** - This is the *core* of the speciation process. Adaptation is what *leads* to divergence and eventually new species.
* **D: 一个种群最终分裂成两个 (A population eventually splits into two)** - This is the *result* of the initial separation and subsequent adaptation.  It's a step in evolution, not an impediment to it.



"
以下哪项陈述没有准确描述物种形成的过程？ ,"The correct answer is **A: 当一个新的种群无法适应时，就会发生这种情况 (When a new population fails to adapt, this happens)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that the new population *does* adapt** to its new environment.  This adaptation *is* the process of speciation.  It doesn't happen when they *fail* to adapt, but when they *succeed* in adapting differently from the original population.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: 它是进化过程中的重要方面 (It is an important aspect of the evolutionary process):** The passage says ""物种形成是进化的必然结果，也是进化中极为重要的一环"" (Speciation is an inevitable result of evolution and an extremely important part of it).
* **C: 它指的是新物种的形成 (It refers to the formation of new species):** The passage defines speciation as ""新物种的形成"" (the formation of new species).
* **D: 它的发生是不可避免的 (Its occurrence is inevitable):** The passage states ""物种形成是进化的必然结果"" (Speciation is an inevitable result of evolution).



"
循环系统的哪一部分将血液带回心脏？,"The correct answer is **D: 静脉 (Veins)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""血液通过被称为动脉的管道从心脏流出，然后通过称为静脉的管道回流到心脏。"" This directly translates to ""Blood flows out of the heart through pipes called arteries, and then returns to the heart through pipes called veins.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 动脉 (Arteries)** - Arteries carry blood *away* from the heart.
*   **B: 毛细血管 (Capillaries)** - Capillaries are the smallest blood vessels and are involved in exchange of substances, not returning blood to the heart.
*   **C: 器官 (Organs)** - Organs are parts of the body, not specifically the part of the circulatory system that returns blood to the heart.



"
循环系统中管道最小的是哪个？,"The correct answer is **A: 毛细血管** (Capillaries).

The passage explicitly states: ""最小的管道叫做毛细血管"" (The smallest pipes are called capillaries).
"
昆虫折叠翅膀的能力增加了以下哪项？,"The correct answer is **B: 躲藏空间 (Hiding space)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""这让它们有了更多小面积空间来躲避捕食者 (This gave them more small space to hide from predators).""  The ability to fold their wings allows insects to fit into tighter spaces and escape being seen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 食物供应 (Food supply):** While flight helps *find* food, folding wings doesn't directly affect the amount of food available.
* **C: 寻找配偶 (Finding a mate):**  Flight helps with finding mates, but folding wings isn't directly related to this.
* **D: 飞行速度 (Flight speed):** Folding wings isn't mentioned as impacting flight speed; it's about *where* they can fly *to*.



"
文章中没有提到以下哪一项会受到昆虫飞行能力的影响？,"The correct answer is **B: 寿命 (Lifespan)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that flight ability helps insects with:**
    * **躲避敌人 (Dodging enemies - predation)**
    * **更有效地寻找食物 (Finding food more effectively - foraging)**
    * **寻找配偶 (Finding mates - reproduction)**

* **Therefore:**
    * **A: 繁殖 (Reproduction)** is directly mentioned as being *more effective* with flight.
    * **C: 采集食物 (Foraging/Collecting food)** is directly mentioned as being *more effective* with flight.
    * **D: 效率 (Efficiency)** is implied, as finding food and mates more effectively increases overall efficiency.

* **B: 寿命 (Lifespan)** is *not* mentioned in the passage as being affected by flight. While flight *could* indirectly impact lifespan (by helping them avoid predators or find food), the passage doesn't state this.

Therefore, the passage doesn't mention lifespan being affected by insect flight ability."
以下哪个特征通常不与恐龙相关联？,"The correct answer is **B: 羽毛**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that many people *don't* think birds are dinosaurs *because* they have feathers and can fly. While we now know many dinosaurs *did* have feathers, it was a characteristic that historically led people to differentiate birds from dinosaurs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 后腿走路 (Walking on two legs)** - The passage explicitly states birds walk on two legs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
*   **C: 产卵 (Laying eggs)** - The passage mentions birds lay eggs, a trait they share with dinosaurs.
*   **D: 有爪的脚 (Having clawed feet)** - The passage says birds have scales and claws on their feet.



"
以下哪项不常被认为是鸟类和恐龙的共同特征？,"The correct answer is **C: 飞行能力**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""很多人认为它们并非恐龙，因为它们有羽毛，会飞。"" This highlights that *flight* is a key difference people often point to when distinguishing birds from dinosaurs. While some dinosaurs *may* have had feathers (and potentially glided), sustained flight wasn't a characteristic of most dinosaurs.

Let's look at why the other options *are* shared characteristics:

* **A: 产卵 (Laying eggs):** The passage explicitly says birds lay eggs, just like dinosaurs.
* **B: 用两条后腿走路 (Walking on two legs):** The passage mentions birds and Tyrannosaurus Rex both walk on two legs.
* **D: 有爪的脚 (Having clawed feet):** The passage states birds have claws on their feet, similar to dinosaurs.

Therefore, flight is the trait that's *not* commonly seen as a shared characteristic, and is often used to differentiate them.



"
根据这段文字，三角龙可能会吃苏铁植物的哪一部分？,"The correct answer is **B: 树干**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""在吃树干之前，三角龙会用它强有力的喙嘴剥去树叶。"" (Before eating the trunk, Triceratops would use its powerful beak to remove the leaves.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 钉子般的叶子 (Sharp leaves):** The text says they *remove* the leaves before eating the trunk, not that they eat the leaves themselves.
* **C: 树根 (Roots):** The text states they can bite through roots, but doesn't say they *eat* them as part of their regular diet.
* **D: 果实 (Fruit):** The text doesn't mention anything about Triceratops eating fruit. It only references fruit in the context of modern animals like parrots being able to eat toxic fruits.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项是三角龙最有可能吃的？ ,"The correct answer is **B: 树枝坚硬的植物 (Hard, woody plants)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""三角龙的牙齿不仅能咬碎树叶，还能咬碎非常坚硬的树枝和树根."" (Triceratops teeth could crush not only leaves but also very hard branches and roots). This directly indicates they were capable of and likely *did* eat hard, woody plant matter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 树懒 (Sloths):** The passage *mentions* sloths as animals that can eat toxic plants, but it doesn't say Triceratops ate sloths.
* **C: 鹦鹉 (Parrots):** Similar to sloths, parrots are mentioned in the context of eating toxic plants, not *being* eaten by Triceratops.
* **D: 果实有毒的植物 (Toxic fruit plants):** The passage presents this as a *dispute* – some scientists think Triceratops ate a potentially toxic plant (cycads), while others believe they wouldn't have due to the toxicity. It doesn't definitively state they ate them.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项运动在意大利最北部地区可能非常流行？,"The correct answer is **C: 单板滑雪 (Snowboarding)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""冬季运动在北部地区最受欢迎，意大利人会在那里参加国际比赛和奥运会比赛。""  Snowboarding is a winter sport.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 足球 (Football/Soccer):** The text says football is *popular* generally, but doesn't specify it's especially popular in the north.
* **B: 排球 (Volleyball):** Similar to football, it's just listed as a popular sport overall.
* **D: F1 赛车 (Formula 1 Racing):** Also a generally popular sport, not tied to the northern region or winter.



"
根据文中提供的信息，以下哪项运动为意大利赢得了世界冠军？,"The correct answer is **A: 足球**.

The text specifically states: ""意大利国家足球队和德国国家足球队都是世界上第二成功的球队，在 2006 年拿下了足球世界杯冠军。"" (Italy and Germany are among the most successful football teams in the world, winning the FIFA World Cup in 2006). 

Therefore, football is the sport mentioned as having brought Italy a world championship."
在哪个事件之后，卢森堡的某些地区被划入比利时？,"The correct answer is **B: 比利时革命 (Belgian Revolution)**.

The passage states: ""今天的比利时有部分地区过去属于卢森堡，但在 19 世纪 30 年代的比利时革命后被划入比利时。"" (Some areas of present-day Belgium used to belong to Luxembourg, but were incorporated into Belgium after the Belgian Revolution of the 1830s.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 第一次世界大战 (World War I):** The passage states Luxembourg was *occupied* by Germany during WWI, not that it lost territory to Belgium.
* **C: 第二次世界大战 (World War II):** Similar to WWI, Luxembourg was *occupied* during WWII.
* **D: 欧盟的成立 (The establishment of the EU):**  The EU's formation is a point of joining, not territorial change.



"
哪个因素影响了卢森堡的中立地位？,"The correct answer is **A: 德国占领 (German occupation)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states ""卢森堡一直试图成为中立国，但它在第一次世界大战和第二次世界大战中都曾被德国占领 (Luxembourg consistently attempted to be a neutral country, but it was occupied by Germany in both World War I and World War II)."" This directly shows that German occupation *impacted* its neutrality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 加入欧盟 (Joining the EU):**  While significant for Luxembourg, joining the EU doesn't affect its *attempted* neutrality.
* **C: 比利时革命 (Belgian Revolution):** This affected Luxembourg's *territory*, not its neutrality.
* **D: 成为独立国家 (Becoming an independent country):** Becoming independent is a prerequisite for *wanting* neutrality, but doesn't directly influence whether that neutrality is maintained.



"
土耳其总面积中有多少平方公里在欧洲境内？,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The passage states: ""23,764 平方公里（9,174 平方英里）位于欧洲."" (23,764 square kilometers (9,174 square miles) are in Europe).
"
根据这段文字，土耳其的长度约为多少英里？,"The correct answer is **D: 1000**.

The text states: ""Turkey's territory is over 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) long..."" 

Therefore, the length of Turkey is approximately 1,000 miles."
梵蒂冈城将拉丁语用于什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 宗教仪式**.

The passage states: ""拉丁语则常使用于宗教仪式"" (Latin is often used for religious ceremonies).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 日常交流 (Daily communication):** The passage says Italian is used for daily communication.
* **C: 法律法规 (Laws and regulations):** The passage states Italian is used for laws and regulations.
* **D: 官方通信 (Official communication):** The passage states Italian is used for official communication.



"
在梵蒂冈城，意大利语不用于什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 宗教仪式**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""拉丁语则常使用于宗教仪式 (Latin is often used for religious ceremonies)."" This means Italian is *not* used for religious ceremonies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 法律法规 (Laws and regulations):** The passage explicitly says Italian is used in laws and regulations.
*   **B: 官方通信 (Official communication):** The passage explicitly says Italian is used in official communication.
*   **D: 日常交流 (Daily conversation):** The passage says Italian is the daily language for most workers.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪些因素受益于在复杂的计算机上进行的声音混合？,"The correct answer is **A: 音乐 (Music)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""录制音乐时往往用复杂的计算机来处理，并把声音混合在一起。"" (When recording music, complex computers are often used to process and mix sounds together.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 动画 (Animation)** - The passage mentions animation being *built* on computers, not mixed.
*   **C: 图片 (Pictures)** - The passage mentions computers processing pictures, but not specifically *mixing* them.
*   **D: 建筑 (Architecture)** - The passage does not mention architecture at all.



"
根据这段文字，哪个地点的大多数住宅拥有抽水马桶？,"The correct answer is **A: 摩亨佐-达罗 (Mohenjo-daro)**.

The text specifically states that Harappa and **Mohenjo-daro** had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to sophisticated drainage systems. While other locations had toilets or drainage systems, Mohenjo-daro is the only one described as having them in *most* homes.
"
以下哪个地点发现了先进的污水处理系统？,"The correct answer is **A: 哈拉帕 (Harappa)**. 

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Harappa and Mohenjo-daro *almost every house* had toilets connected to a sophisticated sewage system. While the passage mentions sewage systems or toilets in Crete/Santorini, Egypt, Persia and China, it highlights Harappa's system as particularly advanced and widespread.
"
以下哪个因素让溜冰者可以转弯？,"The correct answer is **A: 溜冰鞋刀片底部略弯曲 (The slight curvature at the bottom of the skate blade)**.

Here's why:

The passage *explicitly* states: ""由于刀片的底部略弯曲，当刀片歪向其中一侧时，与冰接触的刀边弯曲了。这样一来，溜冰者就可以转弯."" (Because the bottom of the blade is slightly curved, when the blade leans to one side, the blade edge in contact with the ice curves. This allows the skater to turn.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 溜冰鞋刀片的双刃 (The double blade of the skate):** While double blades provide better grip, the passage says grip *allows* skating even when leaning, but doesn't explain *how* turns are made.
* **C: 溜冰者的整体技能水平 (The skater's overall skill level):** Skill is important, but the passage focuses on the *mechanism* of turning, not the skater's ability to perform it.
* **D: 冰的质量 (The quality of the ice):** Ice quality affects skating in general, but isn't the direct reason for turning as described in the passage.



"
根据这段文字，对于现代冰刀的刀片上的凹洞的描述哪个是准确的？,"The correct answer is **C: 凹形的**.

The passage specifically states: ""双刃之间有一个**凹洞**"" (between the blades there is a **concave**). 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 双刃的 (Double-bladed):** While true, the question asks about the *concave*, not the fact that it's double-bladed.
*   **B: 弯曲的 (Curved):** The *bottom* of the blade is curved, not the space between the blades.
*   **D: 倾斜的 (Slanted):** The blades are *tilted* during turning, but the concave itself isn't described as slanted.



"
根据这段文字，什么过程允许原子从光中消除多余的能量？,"The correct answer is **D: 受激辐射**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""科学家把这一过程称为“受激辐射”，因为原子受到强光的刺激，引起光子的发射，而光也是辐射的一种。"" This directly links the removal of excess energy to the process of stimulated emission (受激辐射).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 辐射 (Radiation):** While stimulated emission *is* a form of radiation, it's the *specific process* of stimulated emission that allows the energy removal, not radiation in general.
* **B: 光子的受激发射 (Stimulated emission of photons):** This is close, but ""受激辐射"" (stimulated emission) is the more concise and accurate term used in the text to describe the entire process.
* **C: 光子 (Photons):** Photons are *emitted* as a result of the process, but they aren't the process itself. They are the *how* the energy is released, not *the what* is happening to remove the energy.



"
什么导致原子发射光子？,"The correct answer is **B: 强光的刺激**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""原子受到强光的刺激，引起光子的发射..."" (Atoms are stimulated by strong light, causing the emission of photons...).  This directly links strong light to the emission of photons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 释放多余能量 (Releasing excess energy):** While atoms *do* release excess energy, the text says *how* they do it – by emitting photons *due to stimulation*.  It's the stimulation that triggers the release.
* **C: 不稳定的能量等级 (Unstable energy levels):** The text says they eliminate energy to *return* to a previous energy level, implying instability *leads to* needing to release energy, but isn't the direct cause of photon emission.
* **D: 对辐射的不良反应 (A bad reaction to radiation):** The text states light *is* a form of radiation, and it's used to *stimulate* the emission, not cause a negative reaction.



"
根据这段文字，什么最终会导致灯泡停止工作？,"The correct answer is **C: 灯泡的灯丝烧坏 (The filament inside the bulb burns out)**.

The text explicitly states: ""使用几百个小时后，灯丝最终被烧坏，而灯泡也不亮了 (After several hundred hours of use, the filament eventually burns out, and the bulb no longer lights up).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 灯具未正确关闭 (The light fixture wasn't turned off correctly)** - The text discusses *why* you need to turn it off *before* changing the bulb, not why the bulb stops working.
* **B: 灯泡的金属底部只部分插入插座 (The metal bottom of the bulb is only partially inserted into the socket)** - This describes a dangerous situation during bulb *replacement*, not the reason the bulb failed.
* **D: 电流进入插座的流量减缓 (The flow of current into the socket slows down)** - The text doesn't mention anything about a reduction in current flow as the cause of the failure.



"
更换灯泡时，接触以下哪项可能存在潜在危险？,"The correct answer is **C: 灯泡底座 (Lamp base)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically warns that you can get a severe electric shock if current flows through the lamp base (the metal part at the bottom of the bulb) while you're touching it. It explains that even a partial connection with the socket can make the base live with electricity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 灯丝 (Filament):** The filament is *inside* the bulb and burns out, causing the bulb to stop working. It's not a direct danger when *changing* the bulb.
*   **B: 灯开关 (Light switch):** The passage stresses *turning off* the switch or disconnecting the power, making the switch itself not a danger when handled correctly.
*   **D: 电缆 (Cable):**  The passage suggests disconnecting the cable, implying it's a source of power that needs to be cut off, not something dangerous to touch directly.



"
根据这段文字，原子核分裂时会发生什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 释放能量 (releases energy)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...然后释放一些能量 (and then releases some energy).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 获得质子 (gains protons):** The passage states protons are *used* to combine with the nucleus, not gained when it splits.
* **C: 原子变得不稳定 (atom becomes unstable):** The passage says *some* atoms *have* unstable nuclei, but splitting doesn't *cause* instability - it *is* the result of instability.
* **D: 中子丢失 (loses neutrons):** While neutrons are involved, the passage doesn't specifically say they are *lost* during the split, only that they are part of what's combined.



"
以下哪个将长途电话反射回地球？,"The correct answer is **B: 卫星**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""太空中的卫星接到电话后，几乎是立刻将其反射回去。"" (Satellites in space receive the phone call and reflect it back almost immediately.) 

The other options are incorrect:

*   **望远镜 (Telescope):** The passage says telescopes are used *by scientists* to see clearly, not to reflect phone calls.
*   **光线 (Light):** Light is mentioned as being distorted by the atmosphere, but doesn't reflect phone calls.
*   **火箭 (Rocket):** Rockets *launch* satellites, they don't reflect calls.



"
以下哪个被用于将望远镜送入太空？,"The correct answer is **B: 火箭**.

The passage explicitly states: ""要把卫星或望远镜送入太空，需要一枚超过 100 英尺高的巨型火箭。"" (To send satellites or telescopes into space, you need a giant rocket over 100 feet tall.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 光束 (Beam)** - The passage doesn't mention beams being used to send telescopes into space.
*   **C: 地球的大气层 (Earth's atmosphere)** - The passage explains why scientists *avoid* using the atmosphere for telescopes, not how they get them into space.
*   **D: 超过 100 英尺高的卫星 (Satellites over 100 feet tall)** - While satellites are mentioned, the passage states rockets are used to *launch* them, not that the satellites themselves are the launch vehicle.



"
为了记录时间的流逝，关于周期性事件应注意哪些方面？,"The correct answer is **B: 重复 (Repetition)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""You can keep track of the passage of time by observing **repeating periodic events**. Periodic events are things that happen regularly over and over again.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 持续时间 (Duration)** - While duration is *measured* using periodic events, it's not what defines them.
* **C: 影响 (Impact)** - The passage doesn't mention impact as a characteristic of periodic events.
* **D: 难度 (Difficulty)** - The passage states time is *hard to understand*, not that periodic events are difficult to observe.



"
根据这段文字，时间用于比较事件的哪个方面？,"The correct answer is **A: 长度**.

The passage states: ""时间也是我们用来比较事件持续时间（长度）的方式。"" (Time is also the way we compare the duration (length) of events.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 重复 (Repetition)** - While the passage mentions repetition as a way to *record* time, it doesn't say time is used to compare repetition itself.
* **C: 经验 (Experience)** - The passage states we *experience* time, but doesn't say we compare experiences *using* time.
* **D: 影响 (Influence)** - The passage mentions time *influences* things, but doesn't say we compare influences using time.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪个方面被认为是王位继承人的典型特征？,"The correct answer is **B: 放弃大学而入伍**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Traditionally, heirs to the throne would go straight into the military after completing their education."" This indicates that *going straight into the military* was the typical characteristic of a heir to the throne.  The rest of the options are specific to Charles and represent a *departure* from tradition, not a typical characteristic.



"
根据文中提供的信息，查尔斯是第一个做到什么的英国王室成员？,"The correct answer is **C: 获得学位 (获得学位)**.

The passage states: ""Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to gain a university degree."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 在完成学业之前入伍 (入伍 before completing studies):** The passage specifically contrasts Charles *not* immediately joining the military with the traditional practice.
* **B: 学习考古学 (学习考古学):** While he *studied* archaeology, the passage highlights him being the first to get a degree, not specifically to study archaeology.
* **D: 入读三一学院 (入读三一学院):**  The passage mentions he attended Trinity College, but being the first to do so isn't the key point.



"
特里格瓦松的舰队来自哪个国家？,"The correct answer is **D: 挪威**.

The text explicitly states: ""这支舰队由奥拉夫·特里格瓦松率领。他是挪威人..."" (This fleet was led by Olaf Tryggvason. He was Norwegian...)



"
在历史上的什么时候，德国对爱沙尼亚施加了强大的文化影响？,"The correct answer is **B: 大约 400 年前**.

Here's why:

The passage states the German cultural influence was around ""15 世纪前后"" (around the 15th century). The 15th century was roughly 600 years ago (as of 2024). Therefore, 400 years ago is the closest and most accurate option.

*   **A: 大约 200 年前** (About 200 years ago) - Too recent.
*   **C: 大约 600 年前** - While technically closer than 200, the phrase ""15世纪前后"" more accurately points to 400-500 years ago.
*   **D: 大约 800 年前** - Too far back."
爱沙尼亚语受到什么影响？,"The correct answer is **A: 字母 Õ /õ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""It was created by adding one letter, “Õ/õ”, to the German alphabet."" This directly links the influence to this specific letter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 德语字母表 (German alphabet):** While the Estonian written language *used* the German alphabet as a base, the influence wasn't the alphabet itself, but the *addition* to it.
* **C: 德国修道士 (German monks):** The monks *initiated* the process, but the influence on the language was the resulting written form.
* **D: 上帝 (God):** God is the *reason* for the monks' actions, not a direct influence on the language itself.



"
根据这段文字，印地语母语人口数的波动取决于哪个因素？,"The correct answer is **A: 是否计算了与印地语非常相似的方言**.

The text states: ""母语人数取决于紧密相关的方言是否计算在内。"" (The number of native speakers depends on whether closely related dialects are included.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The text mentions Urdu as being mutually intelligible, but not as affecting the *native* speaker count of Hindi.
* **C:** The text mentions those who *understand* Hindi, but this refers to the total number who can comprehend it, not the number of native speakers.
* **D:** The text does not mention reading ability.



"
关于印地语和乌尔都语，以下哪项陈述是正确的？,"The correct answer is **B: 它们在书写方面有所不同**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""印度语和乌尔都语有着相似的词汇，但文字的书写方式不同"". This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 两种语言的使用者通常存在脱节** - The passage says they are mutually intelligible in everyday conversation, meaning there *isn't* disconnection.
*   **C: 它们在词汇和书写方面相似** -  The passage states the opposite; their *writing* is different, though their *vocabulary* is similar.
*   **D: 它们在词汇方面有所不同** - The passage states their vocabulary is *similar*, not different.



"
以下哪项不是有关韩文字母的准确事实？,"The correct answer is **A: 它是在世宗大王统治初期发明的 (It was invented early in King Sejong's reign)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Hangul was invented in **1444**, while King Sejong reigned from **1418-1450**. 1444 is *not* early in his reign; it's closer to the middle/end of it.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **B: 该字母的原名为训民正音 (The alphabet was originally called Hunminjeongeum)** - The passage explicitly states this.
*   **C: 它是由朝鲜王朝的第四任君主发明的 (It was invented by the fourth king of the Joseon dynasty)** - The passage identifies Sejong the Great as the fourth king and the inventor.
*   **D: 它是特意发明的 (It was deliberately invented)** - The passage clearly states Hangul is ""specifically invented for daily use."""
训民正音字母表最终被改成了什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 韩文字母 (Korean alphabet)**.

The passage states that ""训民正音"" was the original name for the Korean alphabet. Therefore, it evolved *into* the Korean alphabet as we know it today.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 世宗 (Sejong):** Sejong was the king who *created* the alphabet, not what it became.
* **C: 朝鲜 (Joseon):** Joseon is the dynasty, the country, not the alphabet itself.
* **D: 正音 (Jeong-eum):** This is part of the original name (""correct pronunciation"") but not the final name of the alphabet.



"
根据这段文字，哪些语言受梵语的影响？,"The correct answer is **D: 印度语言**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""梵语也是许多现代印度语的起源，就像拉丁语是法语和西班牙语等欧洲语言的起源一样。"" (Vedic is the origin of many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the origin of European languages like French and Spanish.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 拉丁语系语言 (Latin-based languages)** - The passage states that Latin *and* Vedic are origins of other languages, it doesn't say Vedic influenced Latin.
*   **B: 欧洲语言 (European languages)** - The passage *compares* Vedic to Latin in how they are origins of languages, but doesn't say Vedic influenced European languages directly.
*   **C: 古代语言 (Ancient languages)** - While Vedic *is* an ancient language, the question asks which languages were *influenced* by it.



"
根据这段文字，使用梵语减少是因为什么原因？,"The correct answer is **D: 等级制度 (caste system)**.

The passage states: ""梵文由于等级制度的原因逐渐消失 (Vedic Sanskrit gradually disappeared due to reasons of hierarchy).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 复杂性 (Complexity):** The passage doesn't mention the complexity of the language as a reason for its decline.
* **B: 雅利安人移民 (Aryan migration):** The passage states Aryans *brought* the language, not that their migration caused it to decline.
* **C: 拉丁语系语言 (Latin-based languages):** Latin-based languages are used as an *analogy* to explain Sanskrit's influence, not as a reason for its decline.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项是关于木卫一的重力的准确陈述？,"The correct answer is **D: 地球比木卫一对你的牵引力更大**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""如果你站在木卫一表面，你的体重会比在地球上轻."" and ""因此重力理所当然地对你产生了较小的牵引力."" This directly indicates that gravity on Europa (木卫一) is *weaker* than on Earth.
* **Options A, B, and C** contradict this information.  A says Earth's pull is smaller (incorrect), and B & C try to explain weight changes by saying Europa's pull is *stronger* (also incorrect).

Therefore, option D accurately reflects the information given in the text."
根据这段文字，以下哪项陈述准确描述了月球的外层？,"The correct answer is **B: 高地下的地壳更厚**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""高地下的地壳厚一些"" (Highlands have a thicker crust).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 近侧有较厚的地壳** (The near side has a thicker crust) - The passage says the near side is *thinner* (70km) than the far side (100km).
* **C: 远侧的阴暗面可能更少** (There may be fewer dark sides on the far side) - The passage links a *thinner* crust to *more* dark areas.
* **D: 高地下的阴暗面可能更少** (There may be fewer dark sides in the highlands) -  The passage links a *thinner* crust to *more* dark areas. Highlands have *thicker* crust.



"
根据这段文字，月球哪个部分的地壳最厚？,"The correct answer is **C: 在高地下 (Under the highlands)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""高地下的地壳厚一些"" (The crust under the highlands is thicker).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 在近侧 (On the near side):** The text says the near side crust is *thinner* (around 70km) than the far side.
*   **B: 有更多阴暗面的地方 (Places with more dark sides):** The text states the crust is *thinner* where there are more dark sides.
*   **D: 在阴暗面下面 (Under the far side):** While the far side crust is thicker than the near side, the text specifically highlights the highlands as having the thickest crust."
根据这段文字，有些人相信什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 其他行星上存在生命**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""有些人相信其他行星上可能有外星人或其他生命。"" (Some people believe there may be aliens or other life on other planets.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 人类已经到达其他恒星** - The text says interstellar travel is unlikely ""in a long time"" and implies it hasn't happened yet.
* **B: 人类无法探索其他世界** - While the text points out the challenges, it doesn't say exploration is *impossible*, just difficult and distant.  It states people *dream* of it.
* **D: 恒星之间的距离不到数万亿英里** - The text explicitly states the opposite: ""这些恒星非常分散，“相邻”的恒星相隔数万亿英里。"" (These stars are very dispersed, and ""adjacent"" stars are trillions of miles apart.)



"
根据这段文字，离太阳中心越远，什么会变得越薄？,"The correct answer is **C: 气体**.

The passage explicitly states: ""当你距离太阳中心越远，气体就越稀薄。"" (As you move further away from the center of the sun, the gas becomes thinner.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 等离子体 (Plasma)** - While the sun *contains* plasma, the text doesn't say plasma gets thinner with distance.
*   **B: 火 (Fire)** - The text mentions fire as a component of the sun, but doesn't describe its density changing with distance.
*   **D: 地壳 (Crust)** - The text specifically states the sun *doesn't have* a crust like Earth.



"
根据这段文字，太阳的哪个部分从地球可见？,"The correct answer is **C: 光球层** (Photosphere).

The passage specifically states: ""We see the outer part of the Sun as the **photosphere**, meaning 'sphere of light'."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 地壳** (Crust) - The passage explicitly states the sun *doesn't have* a crust like Earth.
* **B: 等离子体** (Plasma) - While the sun *is* made of plasma, the passage says we see the *outer* part, not the plasma directly.
* **D: 中心** (Center) -  We cannot see the center of the sun. The passage mentions it only in relation to the decreasing density of gases as you move away from it.



"
以下哪项观测有助于证实哥白尼的理论？,"The correct answer is **A: 金星的相变 (Venus's phases)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""金星的相变支持了哥白尼的理论，即行星围绕太阳旋转"" (Venus's phases supported Copernicus's theory that planets revolve around the sun).  The explanation details *how* the phases (being lit only on the side facing the sun) are impossible if Venus orbits the Earth as Ptolemy's model proposed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 金星凌日 (Venus transit):** While a fascinating observation, the passage doesn't directly link the transit itself to *confirming* the Copernican theory. It's a consequence *of* the Copernican model, but not direct proof like the phases.
* **C: 太阳与金星的相似之处 (Similarities between the sun and Venus):** The passage doesn't mention any similarities between the sun and Venus.
* **D: 太阳与月亮的相似之处 (Similarities between the sun and the moon):** The passage draws a comparison between Venus's phases *and* the moon's phases, but doesn't focus on similarities between the sun and the moon.



"
以下哪项是伽利略·伽利莱在 1610 年观测到的？,"The correct answer is **B: 金星的相变 (Venus's phases)**.

The passage specifically states: ""伽利略·伽利莱（Galileo Galilei）使用望远镜观测天体，发现金星具有着与月球一致的相位。"" (Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe celestial bodies and discovered that Venus has phases consistent with the moon).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 月球面对太阳的一侧 (The side of the Moon facing the sun)** - While the passage explains *why* phases happen (because only the sunlit side is visible), it doesn't say Galileo observed this specifically.
* **C: 行星围绕太阳旋转 (Planets revolve around the sun)** - Galileo's observations *supported* this theory, but he didn't directly *observe* it.
* **D: 金星凌日 (Transit of Venus)** - Jeremiah Horrocks observed this in 1639, not Galileo in 1610.



"
根据这段文字，亚马逊河的河水来自哪里？,"The correct answer is **A: 较小的支流**.

The passage explicitly states: ""河水来自数千条较小的支流"" (The river comes from thousands of smaller tributaries).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 最长的河流** - The passage states the Amazon is the *second* longest river.
* **C: 海洋** - The passage doesn't mention the ocean as a source of the river's water.
* **D: 第二大的河流** - While the passage mentions it's larger than the second largest river, it doesn't say the water *comes from* that river.



"
哪项荣誉不归于亚马逊河？,"The correct answer is **C: 它是最长的河流 (It is the longest river)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the Amazon River is the *second* longest river, not the longest. 
* The passage explicitly states it's the second longest (A), the largest (B), and the widest (D).

Therefore, the honor that doesn't belong to the Amazon River is being the longest.
"
文章中提到的哪个行业雇用的委内瑞拉人最少？,"The correct answer is **C: 石油**.

Here's why:

* The passage states ""尽管只有百分之一的人在石油行业工作...石油行业仍然是该国的重要产业。"" This directly indicates that only 1% of Venezuelans are employed in the oil industry, the lowest percentage mentioned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 农业 (Agriculture):**  ""五分之一的人在农业行业里工作"" (one-fifth) – this is 20%, much higher than 1%.
* **B: 工业 (Industry):** ""接近四分之一的人从事工业"" (almost one-quarter) – this is around 25%, also higher than 1%.
* **D: 服务业 (Service industry):** ""三分之二的委内瑞拉人就是这样从事服务行业"" (two-thirds) – this is approximately 66%, the largest percentage of employed Venezuelans.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪个行业雇用的委内瑞拉人最多？,"The correct answer is **A: 服务业**.

The text states that ""two-thirds of Venezuelans... work in the service sector"". This is a larger proportion than those in industry (nearly one-quarter) or agriculture (one-fifth). While the oil industry is important, it only employs 1% of the population.

Therefore, the service industry employs the most Venezuelans.
"
根据这段文字，聚变使恒星能够做什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 散发光和热 (emit light and heat)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""恒星会散发光和热，这是因为氢原子结合（或聚变）在一起形成更重的元素时产生了能量。"" (Stars emit light and heat because energy is produced when hydrogen atoms combine (or fuse) to form heavier elements.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 形成更重的元素 (form heavier elements)** - While fusion *does* create heavier elements, the passage states this is *how* it produces energy, not what stars *do* because of fusion.
* **B: 建成聚变反应堆 (build fusion reactors)** - Scientists are *trying* to build reactors, but the passage doesn't say fusion itself builds them.
* **D: 产生氢原子 (produce hydrogen atoms)** - Fusion *uses* hydrogen atoms, it doesn't create them.



"
一个实用的聚变反应堆将创造以下哪项？,"The correct answer is **D: 能源 (Energy)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...a reaction that can produce energy in the same way.""  This directly links a fusion reactor to energy production.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 氢 (Hydrogen):** While hydrogen *is* used *in* the fusion process, the reactor doesn't *create* hydrogen.
* **B: 恒星 (Stars):** The reactor aims to *mimic* how stars work, but it won't *create* a star.
* **C: 原子 (Atoms):** Fusion does change atoms (combining them), but the primary goal isn't just to create atoms, it's to release energy in the process.



"
水的化学成分是什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 两个氢原子和一个氧原子** (two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom).

The passage explicitly states: ""化合物水是由两个氢原子和一个氧原子组成的"" (The compound water is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** Incorrect - The ratio is wrong.
*   **B:** Incorrect - The ratio is wrong.
*   **C:** Incorrect - The ratio is wrong.



"
当水改变形态时，哪个属性将保持不变？,"The correct answer is **A: 分子结构**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""无论是气体、液体还是固体，它的分子结构都是一样的。"" (Regardless of whether it's a gas, liquid, or solid, its molecular structure is the same.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 密度 (Density):** The passage states liquid nitrogen has a *greater* density than gaseous nitrogen. Density changes with state.
* **C: 物理状态 (Physical state):** The question asks what *remains* constant when the physical state *changes*. This is the opposite of what this option states.
* **D: 液态氮 (Liquid nitrogen):** This is a specific example used in the passage, not a property that remains constant during a change of state.



"
根据这段文字，十三个州试图实施某些法律时没有哪个问题？,"The correct answer is **A: 州政府的严格监督**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that Congress *relied on state governments to enforce laws* and that states *often did not cooperate*.** This means states had a lot of control (strict supervision) over the implementation of laws, and this wasn't a problem – it *was* happening.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 国会内部的权力不足 (Congress's lack of power):** The passage *explicitly* states Congress lacked the power to tax, and couldn't overrule state tariffs. This *was* a problem.
* **C: 条款需要得到一致同意才能修改 (Provisions needing unanimous consent):**  The passage says this made amendment difficult and contributed to the weakness of the government. This *was* a problem.
* **D: 一个不存在的国家行政机构 (The absence of a national executive):** The passage states there was no national executive branch, and this was a weakness. This *was* a problem.



"
根据这段文字，哪项陈述准确反映了独立战争期间中央政府的状态？,"The correct answer is **C: 州代表缺乏存在感**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...state delegates frequently absent themselves."" This directly indicates a lack of attendance and therefore presence from state representatives.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 由国会和州政府强制征税 (Compulsory taxation by Congress and state governments):** The passage states Congress *lacked the power to tax*.
* **B: 对条款的修改依赖于国会的权威 (Amendment of articles relied on the authority of Congress):** The passage states amendments required *unanimous consent of all states*, not Congress's authority.
* **D: 中央政府由两个主要组成部分组成 (The central government consisted of two main components):** The passage states Congress was the *only* branch of the central government; there was no executive or judicial branch.



"
《独立宣言》背面的字是怎么写的？,"The correct answer is **C: 倒着写的 (written backwards)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""文字写在文件底部，是倒过来的 (The text is written at the bottom of the document, and it is backwards).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 用大字体写的 (written in large font):** The passage doesn't mention the font size.
*   **B: 用密码写的 (written in code):** The passage says it's text, not code.
*   **D: 用小字体写的 (written in small font):** The passage doesn't mention the font size."
新加坡因以下哪项而闻名？,"The correct answer is **A: 城市绿化 (City Greening)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** Singapore used the expertise of its Botanic Gardens to become a tropical ""Garden City."" This directly relates to city greening.
* **The selection of a national flower (Vanda Miss Joaquim orchid)** further emphasizes the importance of plants and greenery in Singapore's identity.

The other options are not mentioned or implied in the passage:

* **B: 徒步旅行 (Hiking)** - Not discussed.
* **C: 冒险运动 (Adventure Sports)** - Not discussed.
* **D: 表演艺术 (Performing Arts)** - Not discussed.



"
卓锦万代兰是什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 一种花 (a flower)**.

The passage states: ""卓锦万代兰被选为该国的国花。它是兰花的杂交品种。"" (卓锦万代兰 was chosen as the national flower. It is a hybrid of orchids.) This directly identifies 卓锦万代兰 as a type of flower.
"
根据这段文字，新王国时期的埃及人不太可能对吉萨金字塔的哪个特征感到惊叹？,"The correct answer is **A: 它们的年龄**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the New Kingdom Egyptians were amazed by the pyramids' age (""over a thousand years old"")**. Therefore, it's *likely* they were amazed by their age, not *unlikely*.

Let's look at why the other options are good fits for things they *would* be amazed by:

* **B: 使用石头 (Use of stone)** - The passage mentions ""stone pyramids,"" highlighting the material. While stone was used in later structures, the *scale* of stone use in Giza would be impressive.
* **C: 它们的大小 (Their size)** - The passage emphasizes the ""grand scale"" of the Giza pyramids and that their size was never surpassed.
* **D: 它们的建造 (Their construction)** - The passage highlights the ""sophisticated building techniques"" used in the Giza pyramids.

Therefore, the one aspect they would be *least* likely to be amazed by (since it's directly stated as a fact they recognized) is the age.
"
根据这段文字，食草动物从哪里出发追寻雨季？,"The correct answer is **B: 北部山区**.

The passage states: ""每年 10 月前后，大约有 150 万只食草动物从**北部山区**出发，穿过马拉河，前往雨水充足的南部平原。"" This directly answers the question.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 西部平原:** They *return* to the western areas, they don't start from there.
* **C: 南部平原:** They travel *to* the southern plains, not from them.
* **D: 西部山区:** The text specifies the starting point is the *northern* mountains.



"
根据这段文字，大约在四月份，食草动物从哪个地区出发？,"The correct answer is **B: 南部平原 (Southern plains)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Then, after the rainy season around April, they return from the west to the north, *crossing the Mara River again*."" This implies they are *leaving* the area they went to (the southern plains) and heading north.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 塞伦盖蒂地区 (Serengeti region):** The Serengeti region *contains* the areas they migrate through, but isn't the specific starting point in April.
*   **C: 马拉河 (Mara River):** The Mara River is a *crossing point*, not a starting location.
*   **D: 马赛马拉国家保护区 (Maasai Mara National Reserve):** This is part of the Serengeti region and the destination they arrive at, not where they depart from in April.



"
海狮行动是入侵哪个国家？,"The correct answer is **B: 英国**.

The text states ""德国将此次袭击的代号定为“海狮行动”。"" and then describes preparations for invading ""不列颠岛"" (Britain). Therefore, Operation Sea Lion was planned to invade Britain."
德国把对英国的袭击称为什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 海狮行动**.

The passage explicitly states: ""德国将此次袭击的代号定为“海狮行动”。"" (Germany designated the code name for this attack as ""Operation Sea Lion"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 敦刻尔克 (Dunkirk)** - Dunkirk was a retreat of British forces, not the name of the German attack.
*   **C: 德国海军 (German Navy)** - This refers to the German navy, not the operation's name.
*   **D: 皇家海军 (Royal Navy)** - This refers to the British navy, not the operation's name.

在意大利夺取非洲国家的计划中，哪一项没有被提到是必要的步骤？,"The correct answer is **B: 建造额外的船舰**.

Here's why:

The passage states Italy *recently built four new ships* but doesn't mention a need to build *additional* ships as part of their plan to take African nations. The passage specifically outlines these necessary steps:

*   **建立一个军队基地 (Establishing a military base):**  Needed for invading Africa.
*   **摧毁英国基地 (Removing British bases):** Specifically, removing them from Egypt.
*   **摆脱埃及的船舰 (Removing British ships from Egypt):**  To clear the way for Italian access to the Mediterranean.

Therefore, building more ships isn't mentioned as a required part of the plan."
根据这段文字，什么被认为是意大利的主要战争目标？,"The correct answer is **A: 夺取非洲国家**.

The text explicitly states: ""意大利的主要目标是非洲国家 (Italy's main goal was African countries)."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 建立更强大的陆军和海军 (Establish a stronger army and navy):** While the text mentions Italy's army and navy were weak, it doesn't state *building them up* was their main goal, but rather a consequence of needing to reach Africa.
* **C: 摆脱埃及的船舰 (Get rid of ships in Egypt):** Removing British ships from Egypt was a *necessary step* to achieve their main goal, not the goal itself.
* **D: 建立英国基地 (Establish British bases):** The text says Italy needed to *remove* British bases, not establish them.



"
谁与侵略者建立了友好关系？,"The correct answer is **B: 维希法国人 (Vichy French)**.

The passage explicitly states that the ""维希”法国人 (Vichy French) reached a peace agreement with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with them instead of resisting. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 德国人 (Germans)** - They were the *invaders*, not the ones forming a relationship *with* the invaders.
*   **C: 美国人 (Americans)** - The Americans fought *against* the Germans and Vichy French.
*   **D: 自由法国人 (Free French)** - They fought *against* the Germans and Vichy French.



"
参与“龙骑兵行动”的盟军有哪些？,"The correct answer is **A: 美国人和自由法国人 (Americans and Free French)**.

The text specifically states: ""仅仅两个星期，美国和自由法国的军队就解放了法国南部..."" (It took only two weeks for American and Free French troops to liberate southern France...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 维希法国人和美国人 (Vichy French and Americans):** The text describes the Vichy French *ruling* southern France before liberation, not participating in the liberation *with* the Americans.
* **C: 德国人和法国人 (Germans and French):** The Germans were the occupiers, and the text doesn't state French forces fought *with* them in Operation Dragoon.
* **D: 美国人和德国人 (Americans and Germans):** The Americans were liberating France *from* Germany, not fighting alongside them.



"
是什么技术的发展使潜艇能够开始在水下航行？,"The correct answer is **D: 雷达 (Radar)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""随着雷达的发展和精确度的提高，潜艇被迫潜入水下以免被发现."" This directly links the development of radar to the reason submarines began to travel underwater.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: U型潜艇 (U-boats):** U-boats were a *type* of submarine, not a technology that caused them to submerge.
*   **B: 射击范围 (Firing range):** Firing range is mentioned as a limitation of early submarines, but doesn't explain *why* they started diving.
*   **C: 导航 (Navigation):** The passage states Germans were good at navigation, but navigation didn't *force* them underwater.



"
在最初使用期间，潜艇在哪些领域的范围非常有限？,"The correct answer is **C: 射击**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""那时它们的速度很慢，**射击范围也非常有限**。"" (At that time, they were slow, and their **shooting range was also very limited**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 导航 (Navigation):** The passage actually states Germans were *good* at navigation with submarines.
*   **B: 行驶 (Traveling/Movement):** The passage states they were slow, but doesn't say their *ability* to travel was limited, just the speed.
*   **D: 操作 (Operation):** The passage states Germans were good at operating submarines.



"
根据这段文字，谁违反了一项协议？ ,"The correct answer is **D: 苏联人 (Soviet people)**.

The text explicitly states that the Soviet Union violated several treaties – the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties – by invading Poland. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 波兰人 (Poles):** The text says Poland's defenses were broken and they were *retreating*, not violating agreements.
* **B: 罗马尼亚人 (Romanians):** Romania is mentioned only in the context of a potential retreat route; they aren't accused of violating any treaties.
* **C: 乌克兰人 (Ukrainians):** Ukraine is mentioned as a territory where Soviet troops took positions, but they are not accused of violating treaties.



"
以下哪项不是红军执行的任务？,"The correct answer is **C: 在桥头堡区域进行改编 (Adapt the troops in the bridgehead area)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the plans for retreat and reorganization *along the Romanian bridgehead were abandoned*.** This means the Red Army did *not* perform the task of adapting troops in that area.
* **A: 筑起乌克兰阵地 (Establish positions in Ukraine)** - The passage explicitly mentions the Red Army establishing positions in Ukraine.
* **B: 入侵东部地区 (Invade the eastern regions)** - The passage clearly states the Red Army invaded eastern Poland.
* **D: 违反条约 (Violate treaties)** - The passage states the invasion was a violation of multiple treaties.

Therefore, option C is the only task *not* performed by the Red Army as described in the passage.



"
意大利第十军的工程兵司令发生了什么？,"The correct answer is **C: He was captured by British forces.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""In an ambush east of Bardia, British forces captured General Ratausi, commander of engineers of the Italian Tenth Army.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He was captured at Capuzzo.** - While the British captured something at Capuzzo, it wasn't the general.
*   **B: He was killed at Tobruk.** - It was Marshal Balbo who died at Tobruk.
*   **D: He was mistakenly shot by friendly fire.** - This happened to Balbo, not the general.



"
伊塔洛·巴尔博在哪里被杀？,"The correct answer is **D: 托布鲁克 (Tobruk)**.

The passage states: ""Marshal Italo Balbo, the governor of Libya and Mussolini's successor, was killed by friendly fire while landing at Tobruk.""
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项技术是藏传佛教冥想的重要组成部分？,"The correct answer is **C: 将神形象化 (Visualizing deities)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""西藏冥想的核心活动是天瑜伽。通过把不同的神形象化，净化能量通道，激活轮穴，从而达到顿悟的境界。"" (The core activity of Tibetan meditation is Tummo (Inner Heat) yoga. By visualizing different deities, purifying energy channels, and activating chakras, one can reach the state of enlightenment.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 进行呼吸练习 (Performing breathing exercises)** - While mentioned as part of Kundalini Yoga, it's not specifically linked to *meditation* in this text.
*   **B: 重复念语 (Repeating mantras)** - Also part of Kundalini Yoga, but not the *core* of meditation as stated.
*   **D: 掌握瑜伽姿势 (Mastering yoga postures)** - Part of Kundalini Yoga, but not meditation itself.



"
根据这段文字，在藏传佛教冥想的“核心”阶段如何激活轮穴？,"The correct answer is **B: 通过将神形象化**

Here's why:

The text states: ""西藏冥想的核心活动是天瑜伽。通过把不同的神形象化，净化能量通道，激活轮穴，从而达到顿悟的境界。"" 

This directly links the activation of chakras (轮穴) to the visualization of deities (神形象化) within the core practice of Tibetan meditation (天瑜伽).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 通过各种瑜伽姿势** - While Kundalini yoga *includes* postures, the text specifically states visualization is key to the *meditation* aspect.
* **C: 重复念语** - Mantras (念语) are mentioned as part of Kundalini yoga, but not as the core method for activating chakras in meditation.
* **D: 进行呼吸练习** - Breathing exercises are also part of Kundalini yoga, but again, not the central method described for meditation.



"
在节目中，谁演唱了第二首祈祷歌？,"The correct answer is **D: 贾伊·尚卡尔·乔杜里 (Jai Shankar Choudhary)**.

The text states: ""当晚由歌手桑朱·沙玛（Sanju Sharma）开场演出，随后是贾伊·尚卡尔·乔杜里 （Jai Shankar Choudhary）出场。"" This means Jai Shankar Choudhary performed *after* Sanju Sharma, making him the singer of the second prayer song.
"
根据这段文字，谁在供奉食物时演唱了一首祈祷歌？,"The correct answer is **A: 拉卡·辛格 (Lakkha Singh)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""拉卡·辛格 (Lakkha Singh) 还介绍了 chhappan bhog bhajan."" (""Lakkha Singh also introduced the chhappan bhog bhajan."") This means he sang a prayer (bhajan) *during* the offering of the Chhappan Bhog (food).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 贾伊·尚卡尔·乔杜里 (Jai Shankar Choudhary)** - He performed earlier in the program, not during the food offering.
*   **C: Shri Shyam** - Shri Shyam is the deity *receiving* the offering, not someone who sang.
*   **D: 桑朱·沙玛 (Sanju Sharma)** - He opened the program, not during the food offering.



"
当晚倒数第二个表演是什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 茜泽·阿克苏、亚历山德罗·沙费纳和哈里斯·阿莱克修**.

Here's why:

The passage lists the performances in order. ""安纳托利亚之火"" (Anatolia Fire) is explicitly stated as the *final* performance (the headliner). Therefore, the performance immediately before that was Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina, and Haris Alexiou performing together.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 安纳托利亚之火** - This was the last performance, not second to last.
*   **C: 旋转的苦行僧** - This performance happened earlier in the lineup.
*   **D: 法提赫·埃尔科克和穆斯林·古尔斯** - This performance happened earlier in the lineup.



"
亚历山德罗·沙费纳是哪国人？,"The correct answer is **D: 意大利**.

The text explicitly states ""意大利男高音亚历山德罗·沙费纳 (Alessandro Safina)"". This means Alessandro Safina is Italian.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项陈述不正确？,"The correct answer is **A: 在圣塔克拉拉发生了一场火灾 (A fire happened in Santa Clara)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the temperature was over 90°F, describing hot weather, but doesn't mention a fire.** It specifically mentions passengers receiving water *because* of the heat.
* **B: 人们被困在过山车上 (People were stuck on a roller coaster)** - This is directly stated in the text.
* **C: 乘客被提供了水 (Passengers were provided water)** - This is also directly stated in the text (""they were able to receive distributed water"").
* **D: 至少需要 60 分钟才将第一位乘客从车上救出 (It took at least 60 minutes to rescue the first passenger)** - The text says ""at least an hour"" which is 60 minutes.

Therefore, the only statement *not* supported by the passage is that a fire occurred in Santa Clara.
"
根据这段文字，谁对令人不舒服的高温发表了评论？,"The correct answer is **B: 消防队长**.

The passage specifically states: ""消防队长斯科特·库恩斯表示：“圣塔克拉拉当天十分燥热，温度得有 90 多华氏度高。”"" (Fire Captain Scott Coones said, ""It was extremely hot in Santa Clara today, with temperatures in the 90s Fahrenheit."")

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 过山车操作员 (Roller coaster operator)** - The passage doesn't mention any comments from the operator.
*   **C: 乘客 (Passengers)** - The passage mentions passengers *experienced* the heat, but doesn't quote them commenting on it.
*   **D: 警察局长 (Police Chief)** - The passage doesn't mention a police chief.



"
由于海啸活动，哪里发生了电力中断？,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

The text states: ""汤加 (Tonga) 没有重大损失或人员伤亡报告，但电力暂时中断。"" (Tonga had no significant damage or casualties reported, but experienced a temporary power outage.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 纽埃 (Niue):** The text mentions Niue had tsunami activity *recorded*, but not a power outage.
* **C: 夏威夷的学校 (Schools in Hawaii):** Schools were *closed* as a precaution, but there's no mention of a power outage there.
* **D: 帕果帕果 (Pago Pago):** The text says Pago Pago had tsunami activity *recorded*, but not a power outage.



"
根据这段文字，停电对汤加有什么影响？,"The correct answer is **D: 当局无法接收到相关警报 (authorities were unable to receive related alerts)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""停电让汤加当局无法收到太平洋海啸警报中心 (PTWC) 发出的海啸警报。"" (The power outage prevented Tonga authorities from receiving tsunami alerts from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC)).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 有一些损失报告 (There were some loss reports)** - The text says there was no *significant* loss or casualties, not just ""some"".
*   **B: 当局没有收到关于解除警报的消息 (Authorities did not receive news about the cancellation of the alert)** - The text says they didn't receive the *initial alert*, not necessarily the cancellation.
*   **C: 海平面读数受到影响 (Sea level readings were affected)** - The text states sea level readings *indicated* a tsunami had occurred, but doesn't say the power outage affected the readings themselves.



"
警察什么时候得以使用他们的雷达枪测量约翰·里德的行车速度？,"The correct answer is **A: 当他以 160 千米每小时的速度行驶时**.

The passage specifically states: ""警方唯一一次成功检测到里德先生的车速，是在他将车速降到 160 公里/小时的时候."" This directly answers the question.
"
根据这段文字，为什么新西兰警察很难测量约翰·里德的速度？,"The correct answer is **B: 汽车底盘过低 (The car chassis was too low)**.

The text explicitly states: ""由于“黑美人”的底盘过低，新西兰警方没法用测速雷达枪来检测里德先生的车速。"" (Because the ""Black Beauty"" chassis was too low, New Zealand police could not use speed radar guns to detect Mr. Reid's speed.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 他的速度低于 160 千米每小时 (His speed was below 160 km/h)** - The text says they *could* measure it at 160 km/h, but couldn't before that.
* **C: 他只开过桥梁七次 (He only drove across the bridge seven times)** - The number of times he drove across is irrelevant to the difficulty of measuring his speed.
* **D: 奥克兰海港大桥非常老旧 (The Auckland Harbour Bridge is very old)** - The bridge's age isn't mentioned as a factor in the difficulty.



"
地震震中与比尤特相比位于哪里？,"The correct answer is **B: 以南 40 英里 (South 40 miles)**.

The passage states: ""震中位于狄龙（Dillon）东北偏北 20 公里（15英里），比尤特（Butte）以南 65 公里处（40英里）."" which translates to ""The epicenter was located 20 kilometers (15 miles) north-northeast of Dillon, and 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of Butte.""
"
阿布格莱布监狱暴乱期间发生了什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 监狱着火** (The prison caught fire).

The passage explicitly states ""伊拉克的阿布格莱布监狱在一次暴乱中着火"" - ""Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison caught fire during a riot.""

While the other options are related to Abu Ghraib, they describe *what happened after* the fire and riot, not *during* the riot itself.
"
为什么这所伊拉克监狱声名狼藉？ ,"The correct answer is **D: 发现虐囚 (discovery of prisoner abuse)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the prison became infamous *after* the discovery of prisoner abuse following the US military takeover. While the fire and riots happened, it was the abuse that led to the prison's notoriety.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 着火 (on fire)** - The fire was an event *leading* to the discovery of abuse, not the reason for the infamy itself.
* **B: 美军接管 (US military takeover)** - The takeover was a precursor to the discovery of the abuse.
* **C: 多起暴乱 (multiple riots)** - Riots happened, but again, weren't the core reason for the prison's terrible reputation.



"
毛伊岛战争纪念体育场原本要举行什么类型的活动？,"The correct answer is **C: 音乐会**.

The passage states the cancelled event was a performance by a band, and was ""originally scheduled to be held at the Maui War Memorial Stadium with an expected attendance of 9000 people."" This clearly indicates a concert.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 魔术表演 (Magic show)** - The text doesn't mention magic.
*   **B: 足球比赛 (Soccer match)** - The text doesn't mention soccer.
*   **D: 筹款活动 (Fundraising event)** - The text doesn't mention fundraising.



"
谁最终给出了该活动取消的原因？,"The correct answer is **B: 经纪公司**.

The passage states that HK management Inc. (the band's management company) initially cancelled the show without a reason, and *then* attributed the cancellation to logistical issues the next day. Therefore, the management company ultimately provided the reason. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 乐队 (The band)** - The band apologized, but didn't *give* the reason for cancellation.
* **C: 战争纪念体育场的业主 (The owner of the war memorial stadium)** - The passage doesn't mention the stadium owner giving a reason.
* **D: 粉丝 (Fans)** - Fans were informed of the cancellation, but didn't provide the reason.



"
比什凯克的几个居民认为谁应该对抢劫事件负责？,"The correct answer is **C: 抗议者 (Protesters)**.

The passage states: ""几个比什凯克居民将这种违法状态归咎于来自南方的抗议者"" which translates to ""Several Bishkek residents blamed the lawlessness on protesters from the south.""

Therefore, the residents believe the protesters are responsible for the robberies."
谁把抢劫事件归咎于来自南方的抗议者？,"The correct answer is **A: 比什凯克的居民 (Bishkek residents)**.

The passage states: ""几个比什凯克居民将这种违法状态归咎于来自南方的抗议者"" which directly translates to ""Several Bishkek residents blamed this lawlessness on protesters from the south.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 执法人员 (Law enforcement)** - The passage states enforcement was *absent*, not blaming anyone.
*   **C: 无政府主义者 (Anarchists)** - The passage mentions the situation *resembling* anarchy, but doesn't say anarchists are doing the blaming.
*   **D: 一伙人 (A group of people)** - While a group *is* involved (the protesters), the passage specifically identifies *residents* as the ones assigning blame.



"
铃声公司的销售额在什么时候增长了？,"The correct answer is **A: 在《创智赢家》节目中露面后**.

The passage specifically states: ""2013 年他在《创智赢家》节目中露面后，公司的销售额大增"" (After appearing on *Shark Tank* in 2013, the company's sales increased significantly).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 在 2013 年获得资金后** - The passage states the show *rejected* investing in the company.
* **C: 在QVC频道中出现后** - While the passage mentions a QVC appearance, it doesn't link it to a sales increase.
* **D: 在与ADT的官司达成和解后** - The passage mentions a settlement, but doesn't state a sales increase followed it.



"
杰米·西米诺夫是在什么时候决定成立铃声公司的？,"The correct answer is **A: 在意识到自己的门铃不足以满足需求后**.

Here's why:

The passage states Jamie Siminoff created a WiFi doorbell *initially while working in his garage and couldn't even hear the doorbell himself*. This implies he started the company to solve a personal problem – the inadequacy of existing doorbells.  While the passage mentions successes *after* founding the company (like *Shark Tank* and QVC), it doesn't state these events *caused* him to start Ring.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 在《创智赢家》节目失败后** - The show *helped* sales, it didn't prompt the company's founding.
* **C: 在获得融资后** - The passage notes the show *rejected* investing in the company.
* **D: 在QVC频道成功露面后** - QVC was later, after the company was already established.



"
每一集的“阅读彩虹”都为孩子们提供了哪些建议？,"The correct answer is **D: 书籍 (Books)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""每期节目还会向孩子们提供建议，向推荐他们在去图书馆时应当查阅的书籍。"" (Each episode also offers children suggestions, recommending books they should look for when they go to the library.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 电视节目 (Television programs)** - While ""Reading Rainbow"" *is* a television program, the question asks what advice it gives to children *within* the show.
* **B: 当地图书馆 (Maps to the library)** - The show recommends books *at* the library, not maps to get there.
* **C: 主题 (Themes)** - The show focuses *on* themes, but doesn't offer themes *as* advice to children.



"
“阅读彩虹”节目的取消可能是由什么原因导致的？,"The correct answer is **A: 资金短缺**.

The passage specifically states that John Grant and others believe the show was cancelled due to ""lack of funding, as well as a shift in the philosophy of educational programming.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 缺乏艾美奖 (Lack of Emmy Awards):** The passage states the show *won* over 20 Emmy awards, making this incorrect.
* **C: 约翰·格兰特的看法 (John Grant's opinion):** While Grant explains *why* the show was cancelled, his opinion isn't the *cause* of the cancellation itself.
* **D: 《罗杰斯先生的左邻右舍》的成功 (The success of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood):** The passage only mentions the show's longevity compared to these other programs, not that their success caused its cancellation.



"
以下哪个选项不是阿姆斯特丹和博物馆官员发表有关这颗树的论据之一？,"The correct answer is **B: It should be protected**.

The passage states the officials said the tree was infected with fungus, posed a public health threat, and was in danger of falling. These are all reasons *against* protecting the tree, and in favor of cutting it down. The fact that it was saved after a court ruling doesn't mean the officials themselves argued for its protection.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: It will inevitably fall down** - The passage directly states this (""随时都有倒下的危险"").
*   **C: It is contaminated with fungus** - The passage explicitly mentions the fungal infection (""感染了一种真菌"").
*   **D: It poses a threat to public health** - The passage states this as well (""会对公众健康造成威胁"").



"
根据动物解放组织和皇家防止虐待动物协会 (RSPCA) 的总督察，以下哪种情况应该进行检查？,"The correct answer is **D: 屠宰场 (Slaughterhouses)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Animal Liberation organization and RSPCA are calling for mandatory CCTV cameras in **all slaughterhouses** in Australia. David O'Shannessy specifically says regulation and inspection of **slaughterhouses** should be commonplace. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 闭路电视摄像头 (CCTV cameras):** While the groups want cameras *in* slaughterhouses, the question asks what should be inspected, not what should be installed.
*   **B: 任何照看动物的人 (Anyone looking after animals):** The focus is specifically on those working in slaughterhouses.
*   **C: 监控装置 (Monitoring devices):** Too broad - the specific call is for CCTV *in* slaughterhouses.



"
根据这段文字，什么措施可以帮助巩固澳大利亚屠宰场工人对动物福利的重视程度？,"The correct answer is **A: 安装闭路电视摄像头 (Installing CCTV cameras)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that David O'Shannessy believes ""monitoring systems would certainly be a strong deterrent to those handling the animals, that animal welfare is the priority."" This directly links CCTV cameras to reinforcing the importance of animal welfare amongst slaughterhouse workers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 与动物解放组织和英国皇家防止虐待动物协会 (RSPCA) 的强制性会议 (Mandatory meetings with animal liberation groups and the RSPCA):** The text doesn't mention mandatory meetings.
* **C: 定期的屠宰场视察 (Regular slaughterhouse inspections):** While the text says inspections *should* be commonplace, it's the CCTV cameras specifically linked to changing worker behavior.
* **D: ABC 的监督 (ABC oversight):** ABC is only reporting the news; they aren't the mechanism for improving welfare standards.



"
根据这段文字，被捕者的职业是什么？,"The correct answer is **A: Student**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""...another student connected to the March 21st school shooting has been arrested."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 《明尼阿波利斯星坛报》的记者:** The article mentions a source *from* the Star Tribune, but doesn't say the arrested person is a reporter.
* **C: 部落主席:** The text states the arrested person is the *son* of the tribal chairman, not the chairman himself.
* **D: 红湖社区官方:**  The text identifies the person as a student, not someone in an official capacity within the community.



"
根据这段文字，当有关另一起逮捕的消息传开时，多少名受害者的葬礼正在举行？,"The correct answer is **B: 三名**.

The text states: ""Today, Red Lake held funerals for Jeff Weise and **three** of the nine victims..."" 

Therefore, when news of the additional arrest broke, the funeral for three victims was being held."
作为对抗议的回应，哪个国家没有推进他们签署的《ACTA》协议？,"The correct answer is **B: 波兰**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Last month, large protests erupted in Poland when the country signed ACTA, leading the Polish government to decide to postpone ratification of the agreement.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 德国** - The text says protests *happened* in Germany, but doesn't say Germany postponed signing ACTA.
*   **C: 苏格兰** - Protests occurred in Scotland, but it's a part of the UK, and the text doesn't mention the UK pausing their signing process.
*   **D: 立陶宛** - Protests occurred in Lithuania (Vilnius), but the text does not state they paused signing ACTA.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪个国家决定推迟加入ACTA的进程？,"The correct answer is **D: 拉脱维亚**.

The text states: ""拉脱维亚和斯洛伐克都推迟了加入 ACTA 的进程."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 爱沙尼亚** - The text only mentions protests *happening* in Estonia, not that they delayed joining ACTA.
* **B: 立陶宛** - Similar to Estonia, protests were mentioned but no delay in joining ACTA.
* **C: 苏格兰** - Protests occurred in Scotland (Edinburgh & Glasgow) but it's a part of the UK, and the text doesn't say Scotland individually delayed joining.



"
iPod机身过热事件导致多少人受伤？,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The text states: ""...共造成 6 起火灾，**4 人轻微烧伤**."" (resulting in 6 fires and **4 minor burn injuries**).

Therefore, 4 people were injured due to the overheating iPods."
谁称过热事件并不严重？,"The correct answer is **D: 苹果公司 (Apple)**.

The passage states: ""苹果公司向该部门通报另外 34 起过热造成的事故，尽管该公司称这些事故“并不严重”."" 

Therefore, Apple is the one who described the overheating incidents as not being serious."
史蒂夫·乔布斯在演讲中表示，苹果公司将要重新发明什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 手机 (phone)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""他声称：“现在苹果要重新发明手机，我们现在要创造历史。”"" (He claimed, ""Now Apple is going to reinvent the phone, and we are going to create history."")

While he *also* said they would create history, the thing he specifically said they would reinvent is the phone.
"
史蒂夫·乔布斯 2 小时演讲的目的是什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 推出一款新手机 (To launch a new phone)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Jobs unveiled the iPhone and claimed they were ""reinventing the phone."" This directly points to the purpose of the speech being the launch of a new mobile phone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 推出一款新平板电脑 (To launch a new tablet):** The passage mentions a phone, not a tablet.
*   **B: 推出一款新电脑 (To launch a new computer):** The passage focuses solely on the phone.
*   **D: 宣布他的退休计划 (To announce his retirement plan):** The passage is about a product launch, not a personal announcement.



"
克里斯蒂娜·费尔南德斯·德·柯克纳 (Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner) 在阿根廷大剧院宣布了什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 她的总统候选人身份 (Her presidential candidacy)**.

The passage states: ""Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced her presidential bid last night..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 她打算竞选参议员 (She plans to run for senator)** - While she *started* her senatorial campaign there, the announcement was about a presidential run.
* **C: 她竞选布宜诺斯艾利斯省代表的计划 (Her plans to run for Buenos Aires province representative)** - The text mentions this as a past event, not the current announcement.
* **D: 她计划辞去现任参议员职务 (She plans to resign from her current senatorial position)** - The text doesn't mention any plans to resign.



"
克里斯蒂娜·费尔南德斯·德·柯克纳在哪里宣布了她的竞选意向？,"The correct answer is **C: 在距离布宜诺斯艾利斯 31 英里的阿根廷大剧院**. 

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""基什内尔女士在阿根廷大剧院宣布她有意参加总统竞选"" and ""距离布宜诺斯艾利斯 50 公里（31英里）的拉普拉塔市 (La Plata)"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Incorrect - mentions 31 miles but not the specific theater.
* **B:** Incorrect - says ""布宜诺斯艾利斯剧院"" which is not mentioned in the text.
* **D:** Incorrect - says ""拉普拉塔剧院"" which is not mentioned in the text and reverses the location.



"
ACMA对于《老大哥》的调查结果是什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 未违反审查法律 (Did not violate censorship laws)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ACMA found ""Big Brothe"" did *not* violate online content censorship laws. The reason given is related to where the content was stored, but the ultimate finding is non-violation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 在《老大哥》网站上发现有媒体内容 (Media content was found on the Big Brothe website):** The passage says the content was *not* on the Big Brothe website, which is why they didn't violate the law.
*   **C: 违反了审查法律 (Violated censorship laws):** This is directly contradicted by the passage.
*   **D: 发现内容实际储存在服务器上 (Found the content was actually stored on a server):** The passage states that only content stored on the server is considered internet content under the law, and this wasn't the case with ""Big Brothe.""



"
媒体必须符合哪些参数才能被视为互联网内容？,"The correct answer is **B: It must actually be stored on a server.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...only content actually stored on servers would be considered internet content.""  The ACMA determined *Big Brother* didn't violate laws because the video wasn't stored *on their website's* server, despite being available online.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: It must be played on the internet.** - Being played online isn't enough; storage matters.
*   **C: It cannot be stored on a website.** - This is the opposite of what the passage says.
*   **D: It must have ACMA approval.** - The passage doesn't mention ACMA approval as a requirement for being considered internet content.



"
谁是澳大利亚自由党的领袖？,"The correct answer is **B: 约翰·霍华德**.

The text states that Peter Costello is the most likely to *replace* Prime Minister John Howard as leader of the Liberal Party. This means John Howard is currently the leader.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 彼得·科斯特洛** - He's presented as a *future* leader, not the current one.
* **C: 约翰·克尔** - Not mentioned in the text.
* **D: 马尔科姆·弗雷泽** - Not mentioned in the text.



"
为什么澳大利亚尚未拥有核电工业？,"The passage states Peter Costello believes Australia *should* pursue nuclear power when it's economically viable, and that ""in principle there's no reason to oppose it."" This implies the current reason Australia doesn't have nuclear power isn't about danger, cost, or inherent controversy (though those might exist). It suggests something is *preventing* it from being economically viable or commercially feasible.

While none of the answers are *directly* stated in the passage, **A: 缺乏公众支持 (Lack of public support)** is the most logical inference.  If nuclear power were economically feasible but not happening, public opposition would be a major roadblock. The statement about being commercially viable suggests a hurdle beyond just cost.

Here's why the other options are less likely based *solely* on the provided text:

* **B: 过于有争议 (Too controversial):** Costello's statement suggests he doesn't see inherent controversy as a barrier *in principle*.
* **C: 过于危险 (Too dangerous):**  Costello doesn't mention safety concerns.
* **D: 过于昂贵 (Too expensive):** He specifically states it's about *economic viability*, which is broader than just cost and implies potential for future affordability.



Therefore, **A** is the best answer.



"
哪位滑雪选手在向导的帮助下参加了比赛？,"The correct answer is **C: 马切吉·克雷泽尔**.

The passage states: ""波兰男子视障滑雪选手马切吉·克雷泽尔（Maciej Krezel ）和向导安娜·奥加津斯卡（Anna Ogarzynska）在超级大回转比赛中获得第十三名。"" This clearly indicates that Maciej Krezel competed *with the help of a guide* (Anna Ogarzynska).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 安娜·乔彻姆森** - Competed individually.
*   **B: 朴钟硕** - Competed individually.
*   **D: 安娜·奥加津斯卡** - She is the *guide*, not the skier.



"
哪个国家在女子站姿超级大回转比赛中获得了第十名？,"The correct answer is **A: 芬兰**.

The passage states: ""芬兰的卡特娅·萨里宁则在同一比赛中获得第十名 (Finnish athlete Katja Saarinen finished tenth in the same competition)."" 

"
根据这段文字，有关布雷克的哪项陈述不准确？,"The correct answer is **B: He admitted to the assault.**

Here's why:

* **The text states he *denied* the assault.** (""现场被捕的主持人否定了袭击"" - ""The host arrested at the scene denied the assault."") This directly contradicts option B.
* The text confirms:
    * **A: He was arrested at the scene.** (""现场被捕的主持人"" - ""The host arrested at the scene"")
    * **C: He used a stick during the assault.** (""他用棍子是为了不让自己受到伤害"" - ""He used the stick to prevent himself from being harmed."")
    * **D: He claimed people threw bottles at him.** (""声称有多达三十个人向他投掷瓶子"" - ""claimed up to thirty people threw bottles at him."")

Therefore, the only inaccurate statement is that he admitted to the assault.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项没有发生在布雷克身上？,"The correct answer is **C: He was attacked with a stick.**

Here's why:

* **The text states Blake *used* a stick to defend himself**, claiming people were throwing bottles *at him*. It does **not** say he was attacked *with* a stick.
* **A: He was convicted of perverting the course of justice** - The text explicitly states ""Blake was also convicted of perverting the course of justice.""
* **B: He was arrested** - The text says ""the licensee was arrested at the scene.""
* **D: He was told he would likely be imprisoned** - The text states ""the judge told Blake that imprisonment was 'virtually inevitable'.""

Therefore, option C is the only event that did *not* happen to Blake according to the provided text.



"
联合国的全球变暖基金将不用于哪方面？,"The correct answer is **B: 将技术带给发展中国家 (Bringing technology to developing countries)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the fund will be used for:

*   建造防洪房屋 (Building flood-proof houses)
*   改善水资源管理 (Improving water resource management)
*   促进农作物多样化 (Promoting crop diversification)

It *also* mentions sharing technology to help developing countries develop in a cleaner way as a separate agenda item *at the Bali conference*.  However, the fund itself is specifically designated for helping countries *cope with* the impacts of global warming, not for providing technology.

Therefore, bringing technology to developing countries is not a direct use of the fund mentioned in the passage."
根据这段文字，联合国希望拯救什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 现存的雨林 (Existing rainforests)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""巴厘岛会议议程中的其他议题还包括拯救世界上现存的森林..."" (Other issues on the Bali conference agenda included saving the world's existing forests...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 通过技术共享节省金钱 (Saving money through technology sharing)** - While technology sharing is mentioned, the goal isn't *saving money* specifically. It's about cleaner development.
*   **B: 农作物 (Crops)** - Crop diversification is mentioned as something the funds *could* be used for, not what the UN is trying to save.
*   **D: 受水资源管理不善影响的人 (People affected by poor water resource management)** - Better water management is a potential use of funds to *help* people, but not what the UN is directly trying to save.



"
以下哪一项没有被艾伯特·穆坎加列举为仍需达成一致的事项？,"The correct answer is **A: 贝宁是否加入AfCTA**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Albert Muchanga *announced* Benin would join the AfCFTA. This means it was already decided, not something still needing agreement. He specifically mentions **original rules of origin and tariff concessions** as outstanding issues. The passage also states the existing framework is sufficient for trade to begin on **July 1, 2020**, meaning the date was already agreed upon.

Therefore, Benin's membership wasn't a point of ongoing negotiation as stated by Muchanga."
根据这段文字，为什么可以在 7 月开始贸易？,"The correct answer is **B: 已经有了足够的规则和协定框架**

Here's why:

The text states: ""we have enough of a framework to meet the needs of trading starting July 1st."" This directly explains why trade can begin on that date – because a sufficient framework is in place, *even though* some details (rules of origin and tariff agreements) are still being worked out.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text says Nigeria is *planning* to join, but doesn't say the July 1st start date is *because* of their joining.
*   **C:** While the Commissioner announced Benin's joining, it doesn’t explain why trade can start on July 1st.
*   **D:** The text explicitly states that rules of origin and tariff agreements have *not* been agreed upon.



"
文章中提到，《亚特兰大宪法报》指责教育官员的什么行为？,"The correct answer is **C: 未对发现的内部问题采取行动 (Failed to act on discovered internal issues)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...a report highlighted issues with test results, alleging that gains were too dramatic and that problems within the schools were identified but not acted upon."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 篡改了《亚特兰大宪法报》的报道 (Tampered with the Atlanta Constitution's report):** The article states the *Atlanta Constitution* *reported* on issues, not that it was tampered with.
*   **B: 未能创新城市教育 (Failed to innovate urban education):** The passage actually states she was *recognized for* innovative urban education.
*   **D: 报告了低的考试成绩 (Reported low test scores):** The report highlighted issues with the *increases* in test scores being suspiciously high.



"
根据这段文字提供的信息，《亚特兰大宪法报》的报道中没有提到什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 2013 年全国年度校长称号**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states she received the National Principal of the Year award in 2009**, not 2013. The question asks what wasn't mentioned in *the report by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution*.  The report focused on issues *after* her award.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 不寻常的考试成绩提升情况 (Unusual improvements in exam scores)** - The report *specifically* highlighted the implausibly fast increase in scores.
* **B: 有证据表明试卷被篡改 (Evidence that answer sheets were altered)** - The passage states ""subsequent evidence showed answer sheets had been changed.""
* **D: 对于创新城市教育的建议 (Recommendations for innovative city education)** - The passage says she was ""recognized for innovative city education,"" meaning the report likely touched on it as background.



"
根据这段文字，爆炸事件之后已知的信息是什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 官方死亡人数**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""一些报道称官方宣布的死亡人数为 8 人"" (Some reports claim the official announced death toll is 8 people). This is a known piece of information *from the text*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 最终的受伤人数 (Final injury count):** The text states the number is *not* yet determined (""最终的数字尚未确定"").
* **B: 炸弹爆炸附近的建筑物 (Buildings near the explosions):** The text mentions ""总督办公室"" (Governor's office) and ""政府大楼"" (government building) but doesn't give a comprehensive list.
* **C: 是否有其他炸弹被引爆 (Whether other bombs were detonated):** The text confirms there were *three more* explosions (""两小时内，政府大楼附近又发生了三起炸弹爆炸事件""), but doesn't say if *more* than those were detonated beyond that.



"
自 2017 年加盟曼城以来，杰西参加了多少场比赛？,"The correct answer is **D: 53**. 

The passage explicitly states: ""Since then, the Brazilian has featured in 53 of the club’s games...""
"
杰西从哪个俱乐部获得了 2700 万英镑的加盟费？,"The correct answer is **A: 帕尔梅拉斯**.

The passage states: ""21-year-old Jesus joined City from Brazilian side Palmeiras in January 2017, in a deal reported to be worth £27 million."" This clearly indicates Palmeiras is the club he joined Manchester City *from*.
"
以下有关旅馆客人的哪项陈述是不正确的？,"The correct answer is **D: 大多数客人来自圣城 (Most guests are from the holy city)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the guests are *mostly* citizens of the UAE (United Arab Emirates).** This means they are *not* from Mecca, the holy city.
* **A** is correct - the passage says they are pilgrims.
* **B** is correct - ""mostly"" UAE citizens implies some are not.
* **C** is correct - the passage explicitly states they arrived ""on the eve of the pilgrimage.""

Therefore, only option D contradicts the information given in the passage.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项陈述是正确的？,"The correct answer is **C: 客人们来这里是为了麦加朝圣前夕 (The guests came here for the eve of the Hajj pilgrimage)**.

Here's why:

* **The text specifically states:** ""他们是在麦加朝圣前夕来到这座圣城的 (They came to the holy city on the eve of the Hajj pilgrimage).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 没有人死亡 (No one died)** - The text states ""死亡人数至少为 15 人 (The death toll is at least 15 people).""
* **B: 所有客人都来自阿联酋 (All guests are from the UAE)** - The text states ""旅馆的客人大多是阿联酋公民 (Most of the guests were UAE citizens)."" ""Most"" does not mean ""all.""
* **D: 大多数客人是麦加当地居民 (Most guests are local residents of Mecca)** - The text indicates the guests were *coming* to Mecca for pilgrimage, implying they are not local.



"
根据这段文字，以下有关撞击的哪项信息是确定的？,"The correct answer is **D: 残骸的位置**.

Here's why:

* **A: 撞击的规模 (The scale of the impact)** - The text states scientists are *still trying to determine* the scale. So it's not a confirmed fact.
* **B: 撞击的位置 (The location of the impact)** - While we know it happened 491 miles above Earth, the *exact* location isn't specified.
* **C: 撞击对地球的影响 (The impact on Earth)** - The text states they are *still trying to determine* the impact on Earth.
* **D: 残骸的位置 (The location of the debris)** - The text specifically states the U.S. Department of Defense Strategic Command is *tracking the debris* and that *charts will be released publicly*. This confirms the debris's location is being tracked and will be known.

Therefore, the only definitive information presented in the text is that the debris field is being tracked.



"
根据这段文字，关于撞击还需要确定什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 撞击的确切规模 (the exact scale of the impact)**.

Here's why:

* The text specifically states: ""They are still working to determine the scale of the impact and its effect on Earth."" This directly indicates that the scale of the impact is still unknown and being investigated.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 谁将负责残骸追踪 (Who will be responsible for tracking debris)** - The text states the US Department of Defense Strategic Command *is* tracking debris.
* **B: 撞击时卫星的飞行速度 (The satellites' speed at the time of impact)** - The text states the satellites were traveling at 17,500 mph.
* **C: 如何分享绘图分析结果 (How to share the charting analysis results)** - The text says the results *will be released* online, not *how* they will be released.



"
根据这段文字，巴滕曾经在全美最富有榜单上排名第几？,"The correct answer is **C: 第 190 名**.

The text explicitly states: ""巴滕位列 2008 年全美最富有 400 人榜单第 190 位"". 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 第 400 名** - The text states he was on a list *of* 400, but not that he was ranked 400th.
* **B: 第 20 名** - This is not mentioned in the text.
* **D: 第 23 名** - This refers to his estimated wealth in *billions of dollars*, not his ranking.



"
巴滕向以下哪个机构进行了捐赠？,"The correct answer is **B: 弗吉尼亚大学**.

The passage explicitly states: ""He is a significant benefactor of the University of Virginia."" (他该校的重要捐赠者。)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 全美最富有榜单 (Forbes 400)** - The Forbes list *reports* his wealth, he doesn't donate to it.
* **C: 大量机构 (Numerous institutions)** - While possible, the passage only specifically mentions Virginia University.
* **D: 致力于艺术和科学的大学 (Universities dedicated to arts and sciences)** - This is too broad. The passage only confirms a donation to Virginia University.



"
哪一项不是由州长阿诺德·施瓦辛格签署的法案的一部分？,"The correct answer is **C: 在加州以外禁止向未成年人出售或出租暴力电子游戏 (To prohibit the sale or rental of violent video games to minors outside of California)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the law applies to sales *within* California.** It doesn't mention any restrictions outside the state.
* **A** is directly stated in the passage: prohibiting sales/rentals to minors in California.
* **B** is also stated: a $1000 fine for violations.
* **D** is also stated: requiring an ""18"" label on violent games.

Therefore, option C is the only one that isn't part of the law described in the passage.
"
根据这段文字，谁错过了所说的话？,"The correct answer is **C: 米勒**.

The text states: ""米勒说：“迈克在听证会上说了很多……我当时正在做准备，所以没听清他在说什么。”"" This directly means Miller missed what was being said.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 杜瓦尔的孩子们** - The text doesn't mention anything about the children hearing or missing anything.
*   **B: 迈克** - Mike *said* a lot, he didn't miss anything.
*   **D: 杜瓦尔** - The text doesn't say anything about Duval missing the conversation."
根据这段文字，关于米勒在听证会上的经历，以下哪项是真的？,"The correct answer is **B: He was not paying attention while preparing.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""米勒说：“迈克在听证会上说了很多……我当时正在做准备，所以没听清他在说什么。”"" (Miller said: ""Mike said a lot at the hearing... I was preparing at the time, so I didn't hear what he was saying."")
* This directly indicates that Miller was focused on *preparing* and therefore didn't pay attention to what was being said at the hearing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 杜瓦尔在听证会上给米勒留下了印象 (Duval made an impression on Miller at the hearing):** The text says Duval didn't leave a strong impression on Miller.
* **C: 杜瓦尔的两个孩子在听证会上说了很多 (Duval's two children said a lot at the hearing):** The text only mentions Duval speaking.
* **D: 他在听取杜瓦尔的故事时非常专注 (He was very focused while listening to Duval's story):** The text states the opposite; he wasn't listening.



"
谁建议对《清洁空气法》进行修改？,"The correct answer is **C: Jack Layton**.

The text states: “Layton… requested changes to the Conservative’s environmental bill, asking for it to be ‘completely rewritten’.” This directly indicates Jack Layton suggested modifications to the Clean Air Act.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: John Howard** - John Howard is the Australian Prime Minister and is discussing a hospital funding issue, not the Clean Air Act.
*   **B: Conservative Party** - The text says Layton asked *them* to modify *their* bill, implying they weren't the ones suggesting changes.
*   **D: Stephen Harper** - While Harper agreed to the review, it was Layton who initially requested changes.



"
谁否认《清洁空气法》被用作大选前的噱头？,"The correct answer is **B: 一位总理**.

Here's why:

The text states that Australian Prime Minister John Howard ""said the bill was simply to prevent the downgrading of hospital facilities by the Tasmanian government with the extra $45 million funding."" This directly addresses and denies the claim that the funding (and thus the bill) was a pre-election stunt.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 州政府官员** - The state government *criticized* the move as a stunt.
*   **C: 一位新民主党党魁** - Jack Layton was focused on getting the Clean Air Act revised, not defending the Australian hospital funding.
*   **D: 一位联邦议员** - Some federal MPs *criticized* the move as a stunt.



"
当氰尿酸和三聚氰胺在猫的尿液中相互作用时，会形成什么物质？,"The correct answer is **C: 结晶**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""这两种化合物相互作用形成的晶体可能会造成肾脏功能障碍"" (These two compounds interact to form crystals that may cause kidney dysfunction) and ""在添加三聚氰胺和三聚氰尿酸后，猫的尿液中形成了结晶"" (After adding melamine and cyanuric acid, crystals formed in the cat's urine).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 肾脏 (Kidney)** - The crystals *affect* the kidneys, they aren't what is formed.
*   **B: 宠物食品 (Pet food)** - The compounds were *in* the pet food, but the question asks what forms in the urine.
*   **D: 红外光谱 (Infrared Spectroscopy)** - FTIR is a *method used to analyze* the crystals, not what the crystals *are*.



"
研究人员使用红外光谱来观察什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 宠物尿液中的结晶组成**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Through infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) comparison, the composition of these crystals **matched the composition of the crystals found in the urine of affected pets**.""  This directly indicates FTIR was used to analyze *what the crystals were made of* – their composition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 肾脏功能 (Kidney function)** - While the passage links the crystals to kidney problems, FTIR wasn't used to *observe* kidney function directly.
*   **C: 受影响的宠物 (Affected pets)** - FTIR was used on the crystals *from* the pets, not the pets themselves.
*   **D: 受污染的宠物食品 (Contaminated pet food)** - FTIR was used to analyze crystals formed in urine, not the food itself.



"
谁称露娜为“至尊女王”？,"The correct answer is **D: 汤米·追梦儿**.

The text states: “汤米·追梦儿说：“露娜是首位至尊女王，我的第一任经理人。”” (Tommy Dreamer said: ""Luna was the first Supreme Queen, my first manager."")

Therefore, Tommy Dreamer is the one who referred to Luna as the ""Supreme Queen"".
"
谁称露娜为“难以捉摸”？,"The correct answer is **B: 达斯汀·鲁内尔斯 (Dustin Runnels)**.

The text specifically states: “达斯汀·鲁内尔斯（Dustin Runnels，外号“金沙”）评论说：“卢娜和我一样难以捉摸……她可能要更难摸透……””. This means Dustin Runnels described Luna as ""难以捉摸"".



"
事故中的司机没有发生什么？,"The correct answer is **A: His head was injured**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""However, the driver suffered a head injury.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He didn't injure anyone inside the house:** While true, the question asks *what happened to the driver*, not about his effect on others.
* **C: He was transferred from a hospital in Cambridge to one in Great Yarmouth:** The opposite is true; he was transferred *from* Great Yarmouth *to* Cambridge.
* **D: Emergency personnel helped him out of the vehicle:** This describes *how* he was helped, not *what* happened *to* him.



"
什么在南非的橄榄球比赛中并没有脱颖而出？,"The correct answer is **A: 出色的团队合作**.

Here's why:

The passage *specifically states* that excellent teamwork **did** stand out about the South African team: ""他们因其严格防守、控球技术和**出色的团队合作**脱颖而出。"" (They stood out due to their strict defense, ball control skills, and **excellent teamwork**).

The passage also mentions:

*   **B: 控球技术** - explicitly stated as a strength.
*   **C: 在比赛开始时的出色表现** - they had a good start against Zambia (""以 26 - 00 轻松战胜了"").
*   **D: 防守技巧** - explicitly stated as a strength (""严格防守"").

Therefore, teamwork isn't something that *didn't* stand out; it *did* stand out. The question asks for what didn't stand out, making A the correct answer.



"
根据这段文字，南非队的表现何时开始改进？,"The correct answer is **D: 随着比赛的进行**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""南非队看起来明显有点生疏，但随着比赛的进行，南非队的表现稳步改进。"" (South Africa looked a bit rusty, but their performance steadily improved as the match went on.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 在上午 10 点左右** - The text mentions 10 AM as the start time of the competition, but doesn't link that to when South Africa's performance improved.
*   **B: 加强防守之后** - While the text mentions strong defense as a strength, it doesn't say improvement *started* with defense.
*   **C: 输给赞比亚之后** - South Africa *won* against Zambia (26-0), they didn't lose.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项陈述并没有准确地反映中国的经济情况？,"The correct answer is **D: 中国的汽车出口量从未超过德国**.

Here's why:

The passage *specifically states* ""去年，中国的汽车出口量首次超过德国"" (Last year, China's auto exports surpassed Germany for the first time).  Option D directly contradicts this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate:

*   **A: 中国的经济自改革以来呈指数级增长** (China's economy has grown exponentially since the reforms) - The passage mentions a 90-fold increase in economic size, indicating exponential growth.
*   **B: 中国拥有比美国更大的汽车出口市场** (China has a larger auto export market than the US) - The passage states China surpassed the US to become the largest auto exporter.
*   **C: 中国可能最终拥有比美国更大的GDP** (China may eventually have a larger GDP than the US) - The passage explicitly states China's GDP *could* surpass the US within 20 years.



"
根据这段文字，中国的GDP何时可能超过美国？,"The correct answer is **B: 在二十年内 (In twenty years)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""中国的 GDP 有可能在 20 年内反超美国"" which translates to ""China's GDP is likely to surpass the US within 20 years.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 在进行更多经济改革之后 (After further economic reforms):** While reforms are implied to be ongoing, the passage doesn't state *when* it will surpass the US, only *if* it happens within 20 years.
*   **C: 在国家处于新领导之下时 (When the country is under new leadership):** The passage doesn't mention leadership changes being a factor.
*   **D: 在三十年内 (Within thirty years):** The passage specifically mentions *twenty* years, not thirty.



"
胡指出发展中国家应该做什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 避免走污染的老路 (Avoid taking the old road of polluting first, then governing)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states, ""胡锦涛鼓励发展中国家‘不要重走先污染后治理的老路’"" which translates directly to ""Hu Jintao encouraged developing countries 'not to retread the old path of polluting first, then governing.'""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 承担推动其发展阶段的义务 (Take on obligations to promote their stage of development):** While the passage mentions obligations, it's about *not* being asked to exceed their capabilities, not specifically promoting development.
*   **B: 专注于经济产出 (Focus on economic output):** The passage mentions economic output in the context of determining emission reduction amounts, but it's not what Hu encouraged developing countries to *do*.
*   **C: 超越当前的责任范围 (Exceed their current scope of responsibility):** The passage specifically states they *shouldn't* be asked to do this.



"
胡没有提到什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 二氧化碳排放削减数额 (The amount of carbon dioxide emission reduction)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""He did not set a reduction amount, only stating that it would be determined based on China’s economic output.""  Therefore, the amount of reduction is what Hu Jintao *didn't* mention.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 减排的基础 (The basis for emission reduction):** He mentions basing it on economic output.
*   **B: 针对发展中国家的污染建议 (Pollution advice for developing countries):** He specifically encourages them not to ""repeat the old path of pollute first, treat later.""
*   **C: 二氧化碳排放有望削减的日期 (The date by which carbon dioxide emissions are expected to be reduced):** He mentions ""before 2020.""

"
维尔曼表示以下哪个的情况并不好？,"The correct answer is **B: 安哥拉 (Angola)**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Richard Veerman of Doctors Without Borders said, 'Angola is facing its worst-ever outbreak, and the situation on the ground remains very bad.'""  He specifically describes the situation in *Angola* as ""very bad.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 无国界医生组织 (Doctors Without Borders):** The passage mentions Doctors Without Borders *reporting* on the situation, not *being* in a bad situation themselves.
*   **C: Mangola:** The passage simply lists Mangola as one of the organizations involved; it doesn't describe their condition.
*   **D: 世界卫生组织 (World Health Organization):**  Similar to Mangola, the WHO is listed as an involved organization, but its condition isn't described.



"
由于起诉，谁将接任胡纳的内阁职位？,"The correct answer is **A: 戴维**.

The text states: ""胡纳已经辞职，他在内阁中的位置将由国会议员埃德·戴维 (Ed Davey) 接替。"" (Huna has resigned, and his position in the cabinet will be taken by MP Ed Davey.)



"
在起诉之后，谁将担任商务部长职位？,"The correct answer is **A: 兰姆 (Lamb)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""预计国会议员诺曼·兰姆 (Norman Lamb) 将接替戴维空出的商务部长一职."" (It is expected that MP Norman Lamb will take over the role of Business Secretary left vacant by Davey.)

Therefore, Norman Lamb will be the Business Secretary after the changes following the prosecution."
演员在卡米尔·圣桑的歌剧中鼓励观众做什么？,"The correct answer is **A: Participate in using cannabis**.

The passage explicitly states that actors were smoking marijuana on stage and the theater encouraged the audience to join in. This directly relates to participating in cannabis use.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go to Japan:** While the artist in the opera had a love for Japan, the passage doesn't say the actors encouraged the audience to *go* to Japan.
* **C: Come up on stage and perform:** The passage doesn't mention anything about inviting the audience onto the stage to perform.
* **D: Allow them to indulge in what they love for a lifetime:** This is a thematic element of the *artist's* story, but not something the actors were actively encouraging the audience to do.



"
谁主要在歌剧期间吸食大麻？,"The correct answer is **C: 演员 (Actors)**.

The passage specifically states ""actors were smoking marijuana on stage"". While the theatre encouraged audience participation, the *actors* were the ones initially doing it *on stage*.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 艺术家 (The Artist):** The artist is the subject of the opera and has a fondness for drugs, but the passage doesn't say *he* smokes on stage.
*   **B: 法国观众 (French Audience):** The audience was *encouraged* to join, but weren't the primary smokers mentioned.
*   **D: 卡米尔·圣桑 (Camille Saint-Saens):** He was the composer, not a participant in the on-stage actions.



"
列昂诺夫所进行的“太空漫步”还有另一个名字吗？,"The correct answer is **C: 舱外活动**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""...he completed the first **extravehicular activity (EVA)**, commonly known as a 'spacewalk'...""  舱外活动 is the Chinese translation of extravehicular activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 阿波罗-联盟号任务** - This was a mission he *led* later in his career, not another name for his spacewalk.
* **B: 太空竞赛** - This is the broader historical context of his work, not a name for the spacewalk itself.
* **D: 11 号宇航员** - This is a nickname for Leonov, not the spacewalk.



"
列昂诺夫领导苏联参加了哪个任务？,"The correct answer is **B: 阿波罗-联盟号 (Apollo-Soyuz)**.

The passage states: ""Ten years later, he led the Soviet portion of the Apollo-Soyuz mission..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 太空竞赛 (Space Race):** While the mission *marked the end* of the Space Race, he didn't lead the Space Race itself.
* **C: 11 号宇航员 (11th Cosmonaut):** This is a nickname, not a mission.
* **D: EVA (Extravehicular Activity):** He *performed* the first EVA, but didn't lead a mission *called* EVA.



"
谁在事故中受伤了？,"The correct answer is **A: 吉布森 (Gibson)**.

Here's why:

* The text states ""事故发生后，吉布森被送往医院，但很快就一命呜呼。"" (After the accident, Gibson was sent to the hospital, but soon passed away.) This clearly indicates Gibson was affected by the accident and ultimately died from it.
* The text specifically states ""这位 64 岁的卡车司机在车祸中没有受伤"" (The 64-year-old truck driver was not injured in the accident).
* While the children were distressed and frightened, the text doesn't say they were *injured*.
* The garage worker was simply a witness; the text doesn't mention any injury to them.

Therefore, Gibson is the only person explicitly stated to have been affected by the accident.



"
事故中涉及的人发生了什么？,"The correct answer is **A: They both died**.

Here's why:

* **吉布森 (Gibson)** is stated to have ""passed away"" (died) after being taken to the hospital.
* While the truck driver had ""no injuries,"" the text heavily implies the *children* who witnessed the accident were traumatized (screaming, crying, running away), and it's reasonable to infer a fatal outcome for someone involved (likely one of the children).  The phrasing about the children running *from* the accident scene suggests a tragedy occurred *at* the scene.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: One died and one was injured:** The text explicitly states Gibson died, but doesn't mention the truck driver being injured.
* **C: They were screaming and crying:** This describes the children *witnessing* the accident, not what happened *to* those directly involved.
* **D: They both were injured:** The text states the truck driver had no injuries, and heavily suggests a fatality beyond Gibson.



"
参与该项目的科学家希望观察以下哪项造成的影响？,"The correct answer is **B: 潮汐力**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the team is looking for effects caused by ""tidal forces between the dark matter of Andromeda and the dark matter of the Milky Way.""** The analogy to the moon and Earth's tides is used to *explain* these tidal forces.
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **A: 普通物质 (Ordinary matter)** - The passage focuses on dark matter, not ordinary matter.
    * **C: 小粒子 (Small particles)** - While the theory mentions dark matter is made of small particles, the *effect* they're looking to observe is the force these particles create – the tidal force.
    * **D: 暗物质 (Dark matter)** - They aren't observing dark matter itself, but the *impact* of its interaction with other dark matter, which manifests as tidal forces.



"
科学家们正在观测以下哪些物质？,"The correct answer is **D: 人马座星系和银河系** (Andromeda Galaxy and Milky Way Galaxy).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the team is simulating observations *of the Andromeda Galaxy* (人马座星系).
* It also highlights the interaction *between the Milky Way Galaxy* (银河系) and the Andromeda Galaxy due to tidal forces.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the moon is used as an *analogy* for tidal forces, it isn't actually being observed in this study.
* **B & C:** Earth is only mentioned as part of the moon/tide analogy, not as a subject of observation.



"
根据这段文字，哪些方面不会受到保守派的批评？,"The correct answer is **B: 重建工作的不足**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states conservatives *humorously* referred to the spending as ""Bush's New (Orleans) Deal,"" implying they criticized the *amount* of spending (救济支出 and 重建支出 - A & D).** They saw it as excessive.
* **The passage also states conservatives criticized *who* received the reconstruction contracts (谁获得了重建合同 - C).**
* **However, the passage does *not* indicate conservatives criticized the *adequacy* of the reconstruction work itself.** Their concern was with the spending and the allocation of contracts, not whether enough was being done.

Therefore, the one aspect *not* criticized by conservatives, according to the text, is the sufficiency of the reconstruction efforts (重建工作的不足)."
谁在批评卡特里娜飓风救济工作的重建合同？,"The correct answer is **B: 自由派 (Liberals)**.

The passage states: ""自由派人士对重建工作的批判主要集中在把重建合同授予了视为华盛顿内部人士的这一做法。"" This directly translates to ""Liberals focused their criticism of the reconstruction work on the awarding of contracts to those seen as Washington insiders.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 财政保守派 (Fiscal conservatives)** - They *named* the spending ""Bush's New Orleans Deal"" as a criticism of the *amount* of spending, not the contracts themselves.
*   **C: 布什 (Bush)** - The passage doesn't say Bush was criticized.
*   **D: 华盛顿内部人士 (Washington insiders)** - They were the *recipients* of criticism, not the ones doing the criticizing.



"
根据这段文字，星尘号太空舱的灯光最先在哪里可见？,"The correct answer is **B: 北加州 (North California)**.

The passage states: ""It will travel across the west coast of northern California..."" This means the lights will be first visible in North California. 

The other options are incorrect because the passage specifies the spacecraft *travels through* those areas *after* passing over North California."
根据这段文字，该太空飞船将创下以下哪项记录？,"The correct answer is **C: 最快返回地球 (Fastest return to Earth)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""星尘号将打破 1969 年 5 月阿波罗 X 指令舱返回地球时创下的纪录，并创下空前的新纪录，成为返回地球最快的太空飞船。"" (StarDust will break the record set by the Apollo X command module returning to Earth in May 1969 and create a new, unprecedented record as the fastest spacecraft to return to Earth.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 照亮天空的最宽范围 (Widest range of sky illuminated)** - The text describes *where* it will be visible, not that it will illuminate the widest area.
*   **B: 在最多城市中可见 (Visible in the most cities)** - The text mentions specific states, but doesn't claim it will be visible in more cities than any other spacecraft.
*   **D: 从旧金山到洛杉矶最快的旅行方式 (Fastest travel from San Francisco to Los Angeles)** - While the text compares its speed to a trip between those cities, it's just an analogy to demonstrate how fast it is; it's not *actually* a travel method between those cities.



"
Malar Balasubramanian 医生与萨罗贾·巴拉苏布拉曼尼亚有什么关系？,"The correct answer is **B: Daughter**.

The text states: ""...her mother's body was found in the trunk of her car..."" and ""...the body of 53-year-old Sarojha Balasubramanian..."". This clearly indicates that Malar Balasubramanian is the daughter of Sarojha Balasubramanian.



"
萨罗贾·巴拉苏布拉曼尼亚的尸体在哪里被发现？,"The correct answer is **C: 汽车后备箱**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""他们发现了 53 岁的萨罗贾·巴拉苏布拉曼尼亚的尸体，盖着血迹斑斑的毯子，**在汽车后备箱**里。"" (They found the body of 53-year-old Sarojha Balasubramanian covered with a blood-stained blanket **in the car's trunk**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 辛辛那提** - While the location is *near* Cincinnati, the body wasn't found *in* Cincinnati itself.
*   **B: 路边** - Malar Balasubramanian was found by the roadside, but her mother was found in the car.
*   **D: 匹兹堡** - Malar works in Pittsburgh, but the incident occurred in Ohio.



"
eBay收购了什么？,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

The passage states ""eBay 史上最大型的一次收购"" (eBay's largest acquisition ever) and then goes on to talk about how it will help them in regions where *Skype* is popular. This directly indicates that eBay acquired Skype.
"
eBay收购的目的是什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 扩展到新的领域 (Expand into new areas)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states eBay wants to **diversify its revenue sources** and **increase its presence in regions where Skype is popular** (China, Eastern Europe, Brazil). This directly points to expansion into new markets and areas of business.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: 巩固其收入 (Consolidate its revenue):** While diversification *can* lead to more stable revenue, the primary goal stated isn't consolidation, but rather *changing* the sources of revenue.
* **C: 提高知名度 (Increase its awareness):** Increasing awareness is a *result* of the expansion, but not the core *purpose* of the acquisition.
* **D: 满足股东的要求 (Meet shareholder requirements):** The passage doesn't mention shareholder demands as a driving factor.



"
根据这段文字，谁没有与打斗后留在院子里的囚犯互动？,"The correct answer is **D: 医院工作人员**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the injured were sent to the hospital.** This indicates hospital staff were dealing with the *result* of the fight, not the prisoners who remained in the yard.
* **Negotiators** *did* interact with the prisoners, attempting to resolve the situation.
* **Police** directly interacted with the prisoners, ultimately using tear gas to subdue them.
* **Fire rescue personnel** interacted with the prisoners by extinguishing the fire they started.

Therefore, the hospital staff are the only group mentioned who didn't directly interact with the prisoners in the yard *after* the fight.



"
以下哪项最终导致囚犯从暴动中退缩？,"The correct answer is **B: 催泪瓦斯 (Tear gas)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states, ""配备了防暴装备的警察进入了院子，并用催泪瓦斯把囚犯逼得走投无路。"" This directly links the use of tear gas to forcing the prisoners to yield.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 成功的谈判 (Successful negotiation):** The passage states negotiations *failed* to resolve the situation (""谈判人员试图扭转局面，但囚犯的要求并不明确。"").
*   **C: 受伤的狱友 (Injured fellow inmates):** While inmates were sent to the hospital, the passage doesn't say this caused the remaining prisoners to give up.
*   **D: 火灾 (The fire):** The fire was *caused* by the prisoners, and then they were forced to retreat *after* the police used tear gas to put out the fire. The fire itself didn't cause them to retreat.



"
在阿亚图拉·赛义德·阿里·哈梅内伊看来，伊朗应该摆脱什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 对石油的依赖** (dependence on oil).

The passage states: ""伊朗最高领袖阿亚图拉·赛义德·阿里·哈梅内伊称，伊朗对石油的依赖是可追溯到1979年伊朗伊斯兰革命之前的“一个陷阱”，伊朗应该摆脱这个陷阱。""  This directly translates to Ayatollah Khamenei believing Iran should escape the ""trap"" of its dependence on oil.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 金融限制 (Financial restrictions):** While the passage mentions financial restrictions as part of the sanctions, Khamenei doesn't say Iran needs to escape *these*.
*   **B: 伊斯兰革命 (Islamic Revolution):** He traces the *origin* of the oil dependence to before the revolution, but doesn't want to escape the revolution itself.
*   **C: 外来收入 (Foreign income):** While oil is a source of foreign income, the specific problem he identifies is the *reliance* on oil, not foreign income in general.



"
根据这段文字，谁承认了制裁对伊朗经济的影响？,"The correct answer is **A: 高层消息人士 (High-ranking Iranian sources)**.

The text specifically states: ""This televised address marks the first time a high-ranking Iranian source has acknowledged the impact of sanctions is being felt.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 石油输出国组织 (OPEC)** - OPEC reported low oil exports, but didn't *acknowledge the impact of sanctions*. They simply stated a fact about export levels.
* **C: 阿亚图拉·赛义德·阿里·哈梅内伊 (Ayatollah Ali Khamenei)** - He acknowledged Iran's *reliance* on oil was a problem, but didn't directly acknowledge the *impact of sanctions* themselves.
* **D: 欧盟 (EU)** - The EU *imposed* sanctions, they didn't *acknowledge their impact* in this text.



"
以下哪项不是法国投票程序的一部分？,"The correct answer is **D: 由候选人代表计票 (Candidates' representatives counting the votes)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that volunteers count the votes ""under strict supervision and according to specific procedures."" It *doesn't* say candidates' representatives do the counting themselves, only that they can *observe* the process.

Let's look at why the other options *are* part of the process:

*   **A: 透明投票箱 (Transparent ballot boxes)** - Explicitly mentioned as a requirement since 1988.
*   **B: 候选人派出的代表 (Representatives from candidates)** - The passage states candidates can send representatives to observe all stages.
*   **C: 在投票册上签名 (Signing the voting register)** - Mentioned as a step voters take after their identity is verified.



"
选民在哪里表明自己选择的候选人？,"The correct answer is **B: 在预先印好的纸片上**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""选民进到一个小隔间里，把一张**预先印好的、表明了所选候选人的纸片**装入信封中。"" (Voters enter a small booth and put a **pre-printed slip of paper indicating their chosen candidate** into an envelope.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 在投票册上 (On the voting register)** - The voting register is for signing *after* choosing a candidate, to confirm identity.
*   **C: 在信封上 (On the envelope)** - The envelope is just a container, not where the choice is marked.
*   **D: 在小隔间内的机器上 (On a machine in the booth)** - The passage describes a paper-based system, not a machine.



"
是什么促使艾伦开始了为期八年的寻找武藏号的行动？,"The correct answer is **D: He对战争的兴趣 (He对战争的兴趣)**.

The passage states: ""...and began searching for the Musashi because of his lifelong fascination with war.""  This directly answers the question of what prompted him to start the search.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 他的财富 (His wealth)** - While his wealth *enabled* the search, it wasn't the *reason* he started it.
* **B: 他对海床测绘的兴趣 (His interest in seafloor mapping)** - The seafloor mapping was a *method* used in the search, not the motivation.
* **C: 他对海洋勘探的投资 (His investment in ocean exploration)** - Similar to wealth, this allowed the search but wasn't the driving force.



"
根据这段文字，艾伦在什么方面花了大量金钱？,"The correct answer is **B: 海洋勘探**.

The text states: ""据报道，他将很大一部分财富投资到海洋勘探上..."" (It is reported that he invested a large portion of his wealth in ocean exploration...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 修复武藏号** - The text says he *found* the wreck, not that he's repairing it.
* **C: 建造遥控无人潜水器 (ROV)** - The text says an ROV was *used* to find the wreck, but doesn't say he built it.
* **D: 学习海床测绘** - The text says the seabed was *mapped*, but doesn't mention Allen learning to do it himself.



"
根据这段文字，下列哪项可能导致工厂内及其附近的危险情况？,"The correct answer is **A: 铀燃料 (Uranium fuel)**.

Here's why:

* **The text directly states:** ""有关部门推测，这表明现场储存铀燃料的容器可能已经破裂，并且正在泄漏。"" (Relevant departments speculate that this indicates the container storing uranium fuel on site may have ruptured and is leaking.)  This links the potential danger directly to the uranium fuel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 放射性铯 (Radioactive Cesium):** Cesium is *detected* as a result of the problem, it isn't the *cause* of it.
* **C: 白烟 (White smoke):** The white smoke is a *symptom* indicating something is wrong, but doesn't explain the core danger.
* **D: 碘 (Iodine):** Like Cesium, iodine is a *detected* radioactive substance, a consequence, not the source.



"
以下哪项不是发生事故后建议当地居民遵循的安全提示之一？,"The correct answer is **C: 避免吸入白烟 (Avoid inhaling white smoke)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the following safety instructions were given to residents:

*   **待在室内 (Stay indoors)**
*   **关掉空调 (Turn off air conditioning)**
*   **不要喝自来水 (Do not drink tap water)**

While inhaling smoke is generally unsafe, the provided text *doesn't* specifically mention avoiding the white smoke.  It focuses on the precautions related to potential radioactive contamination (staying indoors, turning off AC to prevent outside air from entering, and avoiding contaminated water).

Therefore, avoiding inhaling white smoke is *not* one of the instructions explicitly given in the passage."
根据莫尔博士的说法，下列哪项是关于 XDR-TB 最令人担忧的？,"The correct answer is **D: 它的高致死率**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Dr. Moll described the new variant as ""very disturbing and worrying **because its mortality rate is very high.**"" This is a direct quote and highlights his primary concern.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 在医院感染新变种 (Infection with the new variant in hospitals)** - While hospital-acquired infection is a concern he raises, it's presented as a *how* it's spreading, not the core reason for worry.
*   **B: 这个变种的耐药性 (The variant's resistance)** - The passage states it's *extensively* drug-resistant (XDR-TB), but doesn't say this is the *most* worrying aspect. Resistance leads to the high mortality.
*   **C: 被感染者可能感染的人数 (The number of people an infected person can infect)** - This is a concerning factor regarding spread, but the doctor's primary concern is the severity of the illness itself (high mortality).



"
确诊感染这种新变种的患者中有多少被证实是医护人员？,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The passage states: ""莫尔 (Moll) 博士认为，有些病人可能是在医院感染了病菌，而且**至少有两名病人是医院的医护人员**."" 

Therefore, the answer is 2."
NextGen系统使用什么技术？,"The correct answer is **A: 卫星技术**.

The passage explicitly states: ""It uses **satellite technology**, rather than old ground-based radar technology..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 精确定位技术** - While NextGen *results* in more precise positioning, it's the *satellite technology* that *enables* it.
* **C: 地面雷达技术** - The passage specifically says NextGen *replaces* ground-based radar.
* **D: 碳排放技术** - NextGen *reduces* carbon emissions, but doesn't *use* carbon emission technology.



"
NextGen 为空中交通管制员带来的直接好处是什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 更精确的飞机位置**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""It uses satellite technology...to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 更短的飞行路线** - This is a *result* of NextGen, not a direct benefit *to the controllers*.
* **C: 减少碳排放** - This is a broader environmental benefit, not something the controllers directly experience.
* **D: 更少的燃料** -  Again, a benefit resulting from NextGen, not directly for the controllers.



"
根据这段文字，历史学家没有批判FBI专注于以下哪项内容？,"The correct answer is **C: 重点关注色情案件**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the historians *did* criticize the FBI for focusing on easy-to-solve cases like car theft to boost statistics.** (Options A, B, and D relate to this criticism)
* **The passage explicitly mentions the FBI was *required* to focus on pornography cases due to Congressional funding.** This means the historians did *not* criticize this specific focus – it was a mandated directive.

Therefore, the historians didn't criticize the FBI's focus on pornography, making option C the correct answer.
"
扫黄倡议迫使FBI做什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 指派探员处理色情案件 (Assign agents to handle pornography cases)**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states: ""国会从 2005 财年开始资助该扫黄倡议，并规定联邦调查局 (FBI) 必须指派 10 名探员专门打击成人色情。"" (Congress began funding the anti-pornography initiative in fiscal year 2005 and stipulated that the FBI must assign 10 agents specifically to combat adult pornography.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 分配更多资源到偷车案件 (Allocate more resources to car theft cases)** - The passage criticizes the FBI for *already* focusing on easy cases like car theft. The initiative doesn't increase resources for this.
* **B: 提高机构的成功破案率 (Improve the agency's success rate)** - While the passage suggests the FBI previously focused on easy cases *to* improve stats, the initiative itself doesn't aim to do that. It's about targeting pornography specifically.
* **C: 专注于应该容易破获的案件 (Focus on cases that should be easy to solve)** - This describes the FBI's *previous* practice, not what the initiative forces them to do.



"
响应 JAS 39C 鹰狮战斗机坠毁的消防车发生了什么？ ,"The correct answer is **B: It翻车了 (It overturned)**.

The text specifically states: ""当地媒体报道，一辆机场消防车在响应火警时翻了车。"" (Local media reported that an airport fire truck overturned while responding to the fire.)
"
在 JAS 39C 鹰狮战斗机坠毁后，机场对什么关闭了？,"The correct answer is **A: 商业航班**.

The text states: ""...导致机场关闭，商业航班无法正常起降."" ( ""...leading to the airport's closure and disruption of commercial flights."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 消防车辆** - A fire truck *crashed*, but the airport didn't close *because* of the fire truck, it closed because of the plane crash.
* **C: 当地媒体** - The media *reported* on the event, they weren't closed.
* **D: 空军中队长** - The captain was the pilot of the plane, not something the airport closed.



"
布热津斯基在伊朗革命期间向谁提供了指导？,"The correct answer is **C: 卡特 (Carter)**.

The passage states that Zbigniew Brzezinski ""assisted Carter in dealing with numerous international affairs, such as... the 1979 Iranian Revolution."" 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 基辛格 (Kissinger)** - Brzezinski *succeeded* Kissinger, he didn't advise him.
*   **B: 肯尼迪 (Kennedy)** - Brzezinski advised Kennedy earlier in his career, but not during the Iranian Revolution.
*   **D: 约翰逊 (Johnson)** - Brzezinski worked for Johnson, but not during the Iranian Revolution.



"
谁担任了国家安全顾问的职务直到 1977 年？,"The correct answer is **B: 基辛格 (Kissinger)**.

The text states that Zbigniew Brzezinski *succeeded* Henry Kissinger as National Security Advisor in 1977. This means Kissinger held the position until 1977."
以下哪项陈述没有准确反映出博贝克在贝尔格莱德的职业生涯？,"The correct answer is **A: He scored over 468 goals while playing for the team.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states Bobek scored 403 goals, not over 468.** This is the only statement that contradicts the information provided.
* **B: He scored more goals than any other player** - The passage directly states ""No one has played more times or scored more goals for the club than Bobek.""
* **C: He was named the best player in the team's history** - The passage states ""In 1995, he was named the greatest player in Partizan history.""
* **D: He played more games than any other player** - The passage directly states ""No one has played more times or scored more goals for the club than Bobek.""



"
哪项关于博贝克在贝尔格莱德游击队历史的陈述是正确的？,"The correct answer is **A: He began playing for Partizan in 1945.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""He joined the team in 1945 and played until 1958.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He played for Zagreb before Partizan:** The passage states he was *born* in Zagreb, not that he played for a team there.
* **C: He played for Partizan until 1995:** He stopped playing in 1958, and was named the best player in 1995.
* **D: He became famous for being named Partizan's best player:** He became famous *while* playing for Partizan (scoring 403 goals!), not just because of the award in 1995.



"
根据这段文字，哪一个特征区分了伊氏西爪龙和迅猛龙？,"The correct answer is **B: It has a larger second claw**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Its second claw was larger, hence the name 'Hesperonychus', meaning 'western claw'."" This directly identifies the larger second claw as a distinguishing feature.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: It has two legs** - Both *Hesperonychus* and *Velociraptor* had two legs.
*   **C: It is fully covered in feathers** - The passage says *Hesperonychus* was ""covered in feathers,"" and also suggests *Velociraptor* likely was too (""like *Velociraptor*""). This isn't a distinction *between* them.
*   **D: It is warm-blooded** - The passage states both were warm-blooded. This isn't a distinction.



"
“赫斯佩罗龙”的意义来自于该物种的哪个身体特征？,"The correct answer is **A: 爪子**.

The passage specifically states that the name ""Hesperorornis"" (which is actually *Hesperonychus* - a likely typo in the question) means ""western claw"" and is due to its larger second claw.
"
关于枪击案的哪项陈述是正确的？,"The correct answer is **D: 枪击事件发生在布法罗**.

Here's why:

*   The text states the couple came to Buffalo to celebrate with family and friends *after* getting married in Texas. It also states the husband was a victim of the shooting and that he was born in Buffalo. This implies the shooting occurred in Buffalo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 丈夫和妻子都来自德克萨斯州** - The text states the husband was born in Buffalo and they married in Texas. Only the marriage took place in Texas.
*   **B: 有五名受害者** - The text specifically mentions *four* fatalities.
*   **C: 这对夫妇一年前在布法罗结婚** - The text clearly states they got married in Texas a year ago.



"
哪一项关于枪击案的陈述是准确的？,"The correct answer is **A: 发生在布法罗的一个周年纪念活动上**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""至少有 100 人参加此次聚会，庆祝一对夫妇的结婚一周年纪念日...之后来到布法罗和亲友共同庆祝."" and ""这名30岁的丈夫...是枪击案中的四名死者之一.""  This directly links the shooting to an anniversary celebration *in Buffalo*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 发生在正式的周年纪念活动上:** The passage states the ""正式的周年纪念活动"" was *planned for later* – this shooting was not the formal event.
* **C: 发生在德克萨斯州的一个聚会上:** They were married in Texas, but the shooting happened after they came to Buffalo.
* **D: 发生在夫妇的婚礼上:** The shooting happened one year *after* the wedding, during an anniversary celebration.



"
根据这段文字，官员们最初对“Luno”号的担心是什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 燃料泄漏 (fuel leakage)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""起初官员们担心这艘船上装的货物可能会泄漏。"" (Initially, officials were worried that the cargo on the ship might leak.)  While the ship *was* carrying fertilizer, the initial concern wasn't a shortage (A), the weather (B) or crew injury (D) – it was about potential leakage from the cargo.

"
根据这段文字，关于“Luno”号的故障，以下哪项陈述是不正确的？,"The correct answer is **B: 发生故障时船上有 100 米的燃料 (Occurrence of 100 meters of fuel on the ship when the fault occurred)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states the ship carried 120-160 *cubic meters* of fuel, not 100 *meters* of fuel.** Meters are a unit of length, while cubic meters measure volume. This is a direct contradiction of the information provided.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: 故障发生在装载货物之前 (The failure occurred before loading cargo)** - The text says the ship was *going to* load fertilizer, implying it hadn't loaded it yet when the failure happened.
* **C: 12 名船员中有一人受伤 (One person was injured out of 12 crew members)** - The text explicitly states ""12 crew members were rescued, only one of whom was injured, with a fractured nose.""
* **D: 船被推到了防波堤 (The ship was pushed onto the breakwater)** - The text says ""the wind and waves pushed it onto the breakwater.""



"
阿尔及利亚在哪个年代获得独立？,"The correct answer is **C: 20 世纪 60 年代**.

The passage states: ""20 世纪 60 年代，他回到刚刚独立的阿尔及利亚，教授电影导演知识。"" This directly indicates Algeria gained independence in the 1960s.
"
哪些地方没有为葬礼设置电视屏幕？,"The correct answer is **C: 波兰某些地方**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""In many other Italian cities *as well as* places around the world, *especially* Poland, similar facilities were set up...""
* This implies that while Poland *especially* had screens set up, it doesn't mean *everywhere* in Poland did.  There would logically be *some* places in Poland without screens.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 罗马各地** - The passage explicitly says screens *were* installed throughout Rome.
* **B: 意大利各个城市** - The passage says screens were set up in *many* Italian cities.
* **D: 圣彼得广场** - The passage states the square was too crowded, suggesting screens were used *around* the square, not *in* the square itself. However, the question asks where screens weren't set up, and the text doesn't say screens weren't in the surrounding areas of the square.



"
葬礼是在哪里举行的？,"The correct answer is **C: 圣彼得广场**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""For the funeral held in **St. Peter's Square**, the attendance was so great that it was impossible for everyone to enter.""

While the funeral *was* viewed in many places (Rome, other Italian cities, Poland), the actual ceremony took place in St. Peter's Square.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 罗马各地** - Screens were *set up* around Rome to *view* the funeral, but the funeral itself wasn't held throughout the city.
* **B: 波兰** - Poland had viewing facilities, but the funeral wasn't held there.
* **D: 先在罗马，然后在另一个意大利城市** - The passage doesn't mention the funeral being held in multiple cities.
"
爆炸发生后，谁因为严重的伤势接受了治疗？,"The correct answer is **A: 至少五个人 (At least five people)**.

The passage states: ""...no major casualties were reported, but at least five people were treated for shock after being near the blast.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 没有人 (No one):** The passage explicitly states five people *were* treated.
* **C: 一名煤气公司职员 (A gas company employee):**  The passage doesn't say the employee was injured, only that they were present.
* **D: 一位邻居 (A neighbor):** The neighbor *reported* the leak, but wasn't mentioned as being injured.



"
谁报告了煤气泄漏？,"The correct answer is **A: 楼里的一个邻居**.

The passage states: ""In response to a neighbor’s call reporting a gas leak..."" This directly indicates a neighbor reported the leak. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 公寓里的居民** - The passage explicitly states the apartment was empty.
* **C: 煤气公司的一名职员** - The gas company employee *responded* to the report, they didn't *make* it.
* **D: 楼管** - The passage doesn't mention a building manager.



"
根据这段文字，袭击中有多少人死亡？,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The text states: ""遇难者分别是 25 岁的尼古拉斯·奥尔登 (Nicholas Alden) 和 21 岁的扎卡里·卡德巴克 (Zachary Cuddeback).""  This explicitly states two people died.

The other numbers refer to people injured, not killed.



"
在袭击期间，谁的武器在某个时候无法开火？,"The correct answer is **B: 乌卡**.

The text states: ""乌卡 (Uka) 的武器在指着第五个人的头时失灵了。"" (Uka's weapon malfunctioned while pointed at the fifth person's head.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 卡德巴克** - The text says Cuddeback was *driving*, not that his weapon malfunctioned.
*   **C: 施耐德** - Schneider was *injured* by a weapon, but didn't have a weapon malfunction.
*   **D: 奥尔登** - Alden was a *victim* and there's no mention of him having a weapon.



"
以下哪项运动被从奥运会项目中投票淘汰了？,"The correct answer is **C: 棒球**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""棒球和垒球都曾试图进入奥林匹克项目，而后两个项目在 2005 年落选了。"" This means baseball (and softball) were previously voted *out* of the Olympic program.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 壁球** - The passage says squash *tried* to get in, but doesn't say it was voted out.
*   **B: 橄榄球** - Rugby was *selected* to be included.
*   **D: 空手道** - Karate *tried* to get in, but doesn't say it was voted out.



"
国际奥委会投票决定将以下哪项运动纳入奥运会？,"The correct answer is **C: 橄榄球联盟 (Rugby League)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""橄榄球（更确切地说，联合会式橄榄球）以及高尔夫击败了其他五项运动，被选定为奥运会的参赛项目。""  This directly confirms that Rugby League (also referred to as Rugby Union in the text) was selected.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 旱冰运动 (Roller sports)** - The passage says roller sports *tried* to get in, but was not selected.
* **B: 棒球 (Baseball)** - The passage says baseball was *previously* rejected in 2005 and tried again, but wasn't selected this time.
* **D: 垒球 (Softball)** - Similar to baseball, softball was rejected in 2005 and didn't make the cut this time either.



"
阿瑟·吉尼斯最初租借了圣詹姆斯之门啤酒厂多少年？,"The correct answer is **D: 9000**.

The passage explicitly states that Arthur Guinness signed a lease for **9000 years** for the St. James's Gate brewery. 

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 250** - This refers to how many years *later* the brewery became a global enterprise, not the length of the initial lease.
*   **B: 10** - This number doesn't appear in the text.
*   **C: 1759** - This is the year the lease was signed, not the duration of the lease."
每年吉尼斯啤酒产生多少亿美元的收入？,"The passage states Guinness has a yearly turnover of 10 billion euros, which is equivalent to **$14.7 billion** (147亿美元). The closest answer choice to this is **C: 140**.

However, it's important to note the passage states the *total company* revenue, not just the revenue from Guinness beer itself. But given the options, 140 (representing roughly 14.7 billion) is the most logical choice.

Therefore, the answer is **C**.
"
欧盟中有多少个国家发现了 H5N1 病毒？,"The correct answer is **C: 七个 (Seven)**.

The text states: ""France is the seventh EU country hit by the virus."" 

Therefore, seven EU countries have been affected."
最新一例 H5N1 病毒是在哪个国家发现的？,"The correct answer is **A: 法国**.

The passage states: ""周一，法国东部里昂附近的沼泽内发现了一只死野鸭..."" (On Monday, a dead wild duck was found in a marsh near Lyon, eastern France...). This clearly indicates France is where the latest case was discovered."
在联合国维和人员引起疫情之前，海地上一次与这种疾病的接触是什么时候？,"The correct answer is **A: 19 世纪**.

The text specifically states: ""Before the troops arrived, Haiti had not encountered problems associated with the disease since the early 19th century."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 部队到达之前不久** - The text says the disease hadn't been present for *centuries* before the troops arrived.
* **C: 地震之前** - The earthquake is mentioned as the reason the peacekeepers were sent, but doesn't relate to the disease's history.
* **D: 2009 年** - The text provides no information about 2009.



"
哪个地点的废弃物导致了疾病的扩散？,"The correct answer is **B: 联合国营地**.

Here's why:

The passage states the outbreak started near the UN camp and was caused by improper waste disposal *from the UN camp* contaminating a tributary of the Artibonite River. While the Artibonite River *was* affected (option A), it was the waste from the camp that was the source of the problem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 阿蒂博尼特河** - The river itself didn't *cause* the spread; it was contaminated.
*   **C: 2010 年地震现场** - The earthquake created the need for peacekeeping, but wasn't the direct source of the outbreak.
*   **D: 海地正义与民主研究所** - This is an organization that *reported* on the issue, not the source of the contamination.



"
爱尔兰政府计划做什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 对毒品犯罪者进行定罪**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The health minister is concerned about convictions related to drugs *since* the (now seemingly unconstitutional) amendment took effect. This implies the government is looking to address these past convictions - essentially, dealing with those who *have* been convicted of drug-related crimes.  While they may be looking to change the law going forward, the immediate concern is the existing convictions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 出台更严格的毒品许可法律 (Introduce stricter drug licensing laws):** The passage mentions concern about *exploitation* of temporary legality, but doesn't say they'll tighten licensing.
* **C: 放宽有关毒品许可的法律 (Relax drug licensing laws):** This is the opposite of what the passage implies.
* **D: 将毒品非罪化 (Decriminalize drugs):** The passage discusses *convictions*, implying a concern with the criminal status of drug offenses. While change is likely, the focus isn't simply removing criminal penalties entirely.



"
在爱尔兰什么是暂时合法的？,"The correct answer is **D: 毒品**.

Here's why:

The passage states the government is concerned about people taking advantage of the ""temporary legality of the substances."" This directly implies that **drugs** are temporarily legal in Ireland, and the government is rushing to legislate to address this situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 盗窃 (Theft)** - Not mentioned in the text.
*   **B: 欺诈 (Fraud)** - Not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: 攻击 (Assault)** - Not mentioned in the text.



"
嫌疑人因何罪被调查？,"The correct answer is **A: 非法侵入 (Trespassing)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""该名男性嫌疑人正接受调查，被调查的原因是非法侵入，而不是故意破坏公物。"" (The male suspect is being investigated for trespassing, not vandalism.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 实际损坏 (Actual damage):** The passage states the sign was *not* actually damaged.
* **C: 故意破坏公物 (Vandalism):** The passage specifically says the investigation is *not* for vandalism.
* **D: 盗窃 (Theft):** There's no mention of theft in the passage.



"
在改变标志时，嫌疑人没有做什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 对它造成实际损坏** (Cause actual damage to it).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""该标志没有受到实际损坏"" (The sign did not suffer any actual damage). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 改变其中一个字母** (Changed one of the letters) - The passage says the ""O"" was changed to a small ""e"".
* **B: 用和平标志装饰它** (Decorated it with a peace sign) - The passage states the modification was done ""with black waterproof tarpaulin decorated with peace and love symbols.""
* **D: 使用油布进行修改** (Used tarpaulin to modify it) - The passage mentions the use of ""black waterproof tarpaulin.""



"
根据这段文字，英语教师卡诺没有被指控什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 侵犯版权 (Infringement of copyright)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""He was also accused of copyright infringement, but was not prosecuted."" This means he *was* accused, but the accusation didn't lead to any legal action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 与学生约会 (Dating students):** The text mentions he taught dating tips in his notes, but doesn't accuse him of dating students.
* **C: 印刷未经授权的广告 (Printing unauthorized advertisements):** The text specifically states Modern Education Group accused him of unauthorized advertising on buses.
* **D: 在课堂上讲脏话 (Swearing in class):** The text states he was *allegedly* swearing in class.

Therefore, the only thing he wasn't prosecuted or directly accused of *doing* is copyright infringement, even though an accusation was made."
根据这段文字，谁没有被罗兰多·门多萨劫持为人质？,"The correct answer is **B: 警察**.

Here's why:

* **The text states Rolando Mendoza *was* a former police officer and the one *doing* the hostage-taking.** He wasn't a hostage himself.
* The text explicitly states that **tourists** were held hostage (A).
* **Children** are mentioned as being among those killed and released, meaning they were hostages (C).
* **Photographers** were initially released, then *replaced* a hostage, meaning they were briefly in the position of being offered *as* hostages (D).

Therefore, only the police (specifically, Mendoza himself) were not victims of the hostage situation.



"
根据这段文字，哪些人质没有确认提前被释放？,"The correct answer is **A: 游客**.

Here's why:

The text states ""多名人质获救，目前至少有六名人质确认遇难。"" and ""六名人质（包括儿童和老人在内）以及那些菲律宾摄影师被提前释放。"" 

This means that while children, elderly people, and photographers *were* released, the text doesn't explicitly state all tourists were released. In fact, the initial situation describes the tourists being held hostage, and six confirmed deaths suggest not all tourists survived or were freed. Therefore, ""游客"" (tourists) is the group not confirmed to be released.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 老人 (elderly people)** - The text specifically says elderly people were released.
*   **C: 摄影师 (photographers)** - The text specifically says photographers were released.
*   **D: 儿童 (children)** - The text specifically says children were released.



"
根据这段文字，谁正在收集签名支持巴西同性婚姻合法化？,"The correct answer is **A: 抗议者 (Protesters)**.

The text states: ""抗议者希望在请愿书上收集 120 万个签名，并在十一月提交给国民议会。"" (Protesters hope to collect 1.2 million signatures on a petition and submit it to the National Congress in November.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 罗伯托·杰斐逊 (Roberto Jefferson):** He is responsible for the *legislation* but not the petition.
* **C: 罗马天主教会 (The Roman Catholic Church):** The text states the church *opposes* same-sex marriage.
* **D: 玛尔塔·苏普里希 (Marta Suplicy):** She *drafted* the original bill, but isn't currently collecting signatures.



"
抗议者会把他们的请愿书提交给谁？,"The correct answer is **C: 巴西国民议会**.

The text specifically states the protesters plan to submit the petition *to* the Brazilian National Congress in November. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 罗马天主教会 (Roman Catholic Church)** - While the church opposes same-sex marriage, the petition isn't *for* the church.
* **B: 罗伯托·杰斐逊 (Roberto Jefferson)** - He is responsible for the current legislation, but the petition is for the entire Congress, not just him.
* **D: 圣保罗市长 (Mayor of São Paulo)** -  Marta Suplicy initially drafted a bill, but the petition is going to the national legislature, not the city mayor.



"
根据阿尔芒·范思哲的描述，在人群开始对天气做出反应之前，发生了什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 刮起了大风 (A wind started blowing)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""表演开始五分钟后，刮起了风 (Five minutes after the performance started, a wind started blowing)...约一分钟后，风速达到了 70 公里/小时 (about a minute later, the wind speed reached 70 km/h).""
* This happened *before* the rain, hail, and people reacting/running.
* The other options are incorrect:
    * **A: 下起了冰雹 (Hail started falling)** - This happened *after* the wind and rain.
    * **B: 表演晚了五分钟 (The performance was delayed by five minutes)** - The passage states the wind started *five minutes after the performance started*, not that the performance was delayed.
    * **D: 他的一个家人不见了 (One of his family members disappeared)** - This is a *result* of the chaos, not something that happened *before* the reaction to the weather.



"
根据范思哲的说法，最强烈的风是什么时候开始的？,"The correct answer is **A: 表演开始几分钟后**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""表演开始五分钟后，刮起了风..."" (Five minutes after the performance began, the wind started...)  This directly answers the question of when the strongest wind began. The other options refer to events *after* the wind started."
在“弗雷德”之前，在西经 35°以东记录过多少次大风暴？,"The correct answer is **C: 两次**.

The passage states that ""弗雷德"" is the *third* largest hurricane on record east of 35° West. This means there were two larger storms recorded before it.
"
当“弗雷德”徘徊在佛得角群岛附近时，它向哪个方向移动？,"The correct answer is **D: 西北**.

The passage states: “'Fred' is currently moving **northwest** at 105 miles per hour (165 kilometers per hour).""
"
以下哪个比其前代技术速度更快？,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The passage explicitly states: ""802.11n 的速度大大快于前代技术..."" (802.11n is significantly faster than previous technologies...). 

The other options are all *previous* technologies, and therefore cannot be faster than their successor (802.11n).
"
要使 802.11n 向后兼容 802.11b，需要什么条件？,"The correct answer is **D: 双无线电 (Dual radio)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""It can be backward compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, *provided the base station has dual radio*.""  This directly links dual radio capability to backward compatibility.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 明显更快的速度 (Significantly faster speed)** - While 802.11n *is* faster, speed isn't a requirement for *compatibility*.
*   **B: 802.11b 能够在 5.0GHz 上运行的能力 (802.11b's ability to operate on 5.0GHz)** - 802.11b operates on 2.4GHz, not 5.0GHz.
*   **C: 600Mbit/s 的吞吐量 (600Mbit/s throughput)** - This is the *maximum* speed of 802.11n, not a requirement for compatibility with older standards.



"
这位奥运会金牌得主本应在英联邦运动会中参加多少个游泳项目？,"The correct answer is **A: Five**.

Here's why:

* **100m freestyle**
* **200m freestyle**
* **Three relay races** (as stated in the passage)

This totals five swimming events."
为什么这位奥运会金牌得主没有服用止痛药？,"The correct answer is **D: 英联邦运动会不允许服用止痛药 (The Commonwealth Games do not allow participants to take these drugs)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""他一直无法用药物来缓解疼痛，因为比赛禁止参赛者服用这些药物 (He has been unable to alleviate the pain with medication because the competition prohibits participants from taking these drugs).""  This refers to the Commonwealth Games.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 他没有任何疼痛 (He has no pain)** - The passage says he *has* pain, and is trying to relieve it.
* **B: 药物让他感觉不适 (The medication makes him feel unwell)** - The passage doesn't mention any side effects of the medication, only that he *can't* take it.
* **C: 他担心药物会对他的健康状况产生负面影响 (He's worried the medication will have a negative effect on his health)** -  The passage focuses on the *rules* prohibiting the medication, not his personal concerns about it.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项可能导致对地震活动的怀疑？,"The correct answer is **A: 乌云的存在**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""These clouds might lead people to suspect whether a volcanic eruption actually occurred."" This directly links the clouds to potential doubt about volcanic activity, and therefore, about whether significant seismic activity (like an eruption) happened.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 来自冰岛气象局的报告** - The report *denies* earthquake activity, it doesn't cause doubt.
*   **C: 国际地震图** - The map *confirms* no recent earthquakes, again, not causing doubt.
*   **D: 冰岛其他地区的活动报告** - The text doesn't mention activity in other regions.



"
根据这段文字，相位变化是什么时候发生的？,"The correct answer is **C: 3 月 10 日**

The text states: ""导致相位变化的重大地震活动于 3 月 10 日发生在该火山顶部火山口的东北侧。"" This directly tells us the phase change occurred on March 10th. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 3 月 10 日之前** - The text states the activity *happened* on March 10th, not before.
*   **B: 过去 48 小时** - The text specifically states there has been no activity in the past 48 hours.
*   **D: 前一周** - The text says there were no earthquakes in the previous week, but the phase change happened on March 10th."
关于月船一号的月球探测器，以下哪项陈述是不正确的？,"The correct answer is **A: 发射探测器的轨道飞行器有一个乘员 (The orbiter that launched the probe had a crew)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the orbiter is *unmanned* (无人驾驶).** This directly contradicts option A.
* **B is correct:** The passage explicitly states the probe carried ""three important scientific instruments.""
* **C is correct:** The probe ""successfully hard-landed.""
* **D is correct:** The passage states the probe had the Indian flag ""printed on each side.""

Therefore, the incorrect statement is that the orbiter had a crew.
"
以下哪项陈述准确描述了月球探测器？,"The correct answer is **B: 它的迫降是成功的** (Its crash landing was successful).

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states:** ""…and successfully made a hard landing near the lunar south pole.""  ""Hard landing"" is a specific type of crash landing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 它降落在月球北极附近 (It landed near the lunar north pole):** The passage says it landed near the *south* pole.
*   **C: 它是从有人轨道飞行器中发射的 (It was launched from a manned orbital vehicle):** The passage says it was launched from the *unmanned* ""Chandrayaan-1 orbiter"".
*   **D: 它携带了两台关键仪器 (It carried two key instruments):** The passage states it carried *three* important scientific instruments.



"
根据这段文字，哪项防疫措施将最后实施？,"The correct answer is **C: 脑炎疫苗**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the government **promised** to provide millions of doses of encephalitis vaccine to help prepare for next year.
* However, it *also* says the plan to provide vaccine to historically worst-hit areas was **postponed** this year due to lack of funds and lower priority.

This clearly indicates the vaccine rollout is planned, but is the last action to be implemented (and even then, delayed).  The other options (insecticides, pig traps, and mosquito nets) were all described as actions already *taken* in response to the outbreak.

Therefore, **C** is the correct answer."
这种疾病是如何传染给人类的？,"The correct answer is **A: 蚊子**.

The passage states: ""猪携带该疾病，然后通过**蚊子**传染给人类。"" (Pigs carry the disease, then transmit it to humans through **mosquitoes**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 杀虫剂 (Insecticide):** Insecticide is *used to combat* the disease, not how it's transmitted.
* **C: 猪 (Pigs):** Pigs *carry* the disease, but don't directly transmit it to humans.
* **D: 捕猪器 (Pig traps):** Pig traps are a measure to control the pig population, not the method of transmission.



"
第二个语句未能通过可能导致什么结果？,"The correct answer is **B: 未来有权进行同性民事结合 (Future possibility of same-sex civil unions)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the failure to pass the second statement ""may open the door to future same-sex marriage.""  Civil unions are a step towards marriage, and the removal of the prohibition creates that possibility.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 对 HJR-3 的立即审查 (Immediate review of HJR-3)** - The passage states the next review will be in 2015 or 2016, not immediately.
*   **C: 紧急立法会议 (Emergency legislative session)** - The passage doesn't mention any emergency session.
*   **D: 禁止同性民事结合 (Prohibition of same-sex civil unions)** - The passage states the *removal* of a prohibition, not its continuation.



"
根据这段文字，第二个语句是在什么时候被删除的？,"The correct answer is **C: 周一 (Monday)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""随后参议院在周一如法炮制，使其获准通过。"" (Subsequently, the Senate followed suit on Monday, allowing it to pass.) This directly indicates the second statement was removed by the Senate on Monday. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 立法会期间 (During the legislative session):** While true, it's not *specific* enough. The text pinpoints the *day* within the session.
*   **B: 2011 年 (2011):** The original bill passed in 2011, but the *deletion* of the second statement happened later.
*   **D: 2015 年 (2015):**  The resolution will be *reviewed* in 2015/2016, not deleted then.



"
“巴拿马文件”是被爆料给谁的？,"The correct answer is **B: 媒体**.

The passage states: ""这些文件在 2016 年春季被爆料给**媒体**."" (These documents were leaked to the **media** in the spring of 2016.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 莫萨克·冯塞卡律师事务所 (Mossack Fonseca)** - This is the *source* of the documents, not who they were leaked *to*.
* **C: 德意志银行 (Deutsche Bank)** -  The bank is mentioned as being heavily involved *in* the schemes revealed by the documents, but wasn't the recipient of the leak.
* **D: 冰岛政府领导人 (Icelandic government leaders)** -  They were affected by the leak, leading to their resignation, but didn't receive the documents themselves.



"
根据这段文字，英国媒体声称谁管理了许多用于隐瞒财富的公司？,"The correct answer is **C: 德意志银行**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""英国《卫报》指出，在用于实现这一目标的 1200 家空壳公司中，德意志银行控制了大约三分之一。"" (The Guardian pointed out that Deutsche Bank controlled about a third of the 1200 shell companies used to achieve this.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 不同银行的富有客户 (Wealthy clients of different banks)** - The text doesn't say clients *managed* the companies, but rather used them.
*   **B: 巴拿马律师事务所 (Panama law firm)** - While Mossack Fonseca created the companies, the text specifies Deutsche Bank *controlled* a large portion of them.
*   **D: 巴基斯坦政府 (Pakistan government)** - The text mentions the Pakistan government leader resigning *as a result* of the leaks, not managing the companies.



"
以下哪次空难造成的死亡人数最多？,"The correct answer is **A: 从伊朗前往亚美尼亚的飞机坠毁** (The plane from Iran to Armenia crashed).

The passage states that the crash of a passenger plane flying to Armenia resulted in **168 fatalities**, which is described as the deadliest crash in Iran in years. This is significantly higher than the other options:

*   B: 警用直升机坠毁 (Police helicopter crash) - 3 deaths
*   D: 飞机在马什哈德坠毁 (Plane crash in Mashhad) - 17 deaths
*   C: 从亚美尼亚前往伊朗的飞机坠毁 (Plane from Armenia to Iran crashed) - This isn't mentioned in the text, making it an incorrect option.



"
以下哪项不是伊朗空难频发的原因？,"The correct answer is **B: 缺乏购买新飞机的预算**. 

Here's why:

The passage *directly states* that Iran cannot buy new planes **because of international sanctions** (C). It also states the planes are old and lack maintenance (A & D).  While lack of budget is *a consequence* of the sanctions, the sanctions themselves are the primary reason for not being able to acquire new aircraft. Therefore, saying they lack a budget is redundant given the information provided.

Let's break down why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: 民用和军用飞机老化 (Civil and military aircraft are aging)** - The passage explicitly states this.
*   **C: 制裁阻止了新飞机的购买 (Sanctions prevent the purchase of new aircraft)** - The passage directly states Iran ""cannot purchase new planes"" due to sanctions.
*   **D: 机队维护不善 (Poor fleet maintenance)** - The passage mentions the planes are ""lacking maintenance.""



"
伊拉克研究小组的报告中没有包含以下哪项？,"The correct answer is **B: 声明通过某些变革可以避免日益严重的暴力**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the report *warns* that no one can guarantee any action will prevent sectarian war, escalating violence, or chaos.** This means the report does *not* offer assurances that changes will avoid violence – quite the opposite.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 对目前政策的批评 (Criticism of current policy):** The passage clearly states the report ""sharply criticizes almost every aspect of the administration’s current policy on Iraq.""
* **C: 对于保护伊拉克边界的建议 (Recommendations for protecting Iraq's borders):** The passage says the first recommendation is ""new diplomatic initiatives...to secure Iraq’s borders.""
* **D: 呼吁美国形成共识 (Call for US consensus):** The passage states the report ""opens with a call for a public debate in the United States and a forming of consensus on Middle East policy.""



"
伊拉克研究小组在报告中没有敦促以下哪项？,"The correct answer is **A: 宣布保证阻止暴力增长**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the report *warns* that no one can *guarantee* action will prevent violence.** It explicitly says there's no assurance of stopping the violence. Therefore, they didn't *urge* a guarantee of preventing violence – they acknowledged its impossibility.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 立即改变方向 (Immediate change of direction):** The passage clearly states the report ""urged an immediate change of direction.""
* **C: 展开公开辩论 (Open debate):** The report ""opened with a call for a public debate...on Middle East policy.""
* **D: 采取新的外交行动 (New diplomatic initiative):** The first recommendation of the report was ""a new diplomatic initiative…to secure Iraq’s borders.""



"
根据警方的说法，谁被认为是普罗文扎诺的得力助手？,"The correct answer is **B: 洛皮科洛 (Lopico)**.

The passage states: ""警方表示，洛皮科洛之所以能占上风，是因为他曾是普罗文扎诺在巴勒莫的得力助手。"" (Police said Lopico was able to gain the upper hand because he had been a trusted aide to Provenzano in Palermo.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 乔瓦尼·法尔科内 (Giovanni Falcone)** - The passage states he was a victim of a war *ended* by Provenzano.
*   **C: 安莎通讯社 (ANSA)** - This is the news agency *reporting* the information, not a person.
*   **D: 保罗·博尔塞利诺 (Paolo Borsellino)** - Similar to Falcone, he was a victim of the war ended by Provenzano.



"
根据这段文字提供的信息，法尔科内之死的原因是什么？,"The correct answer is **A: He was killed in a war launched by Riina.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Provenzano ended the anti-state war launched by Riina, a war that took the lives of Mafia crusaders Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino."" 

This directly links Falcone's death to the war initiated by Riina. The other options are not supported by the provided text.



"
以下哪项不是齐藤仁的荣誉之一？,"The correct answer is **D: 柔道专家 (Judoka expert)**.

Here's why:

* **A: 两次世界冠军 (Two-time World Champion):** The text states he was a ""world champion"".
* **B: 全日本柔道联盟委员会主席 (Chairman of the All Japan Judo Federation Training Committee):** The text explicitly states he was the ""chairman of the All Japan Judo Federation Training Committee"".
* **C: 两枚奥运会金牌得主 (Two-time Olympic Gold Medalist):** The text states he was a ""two-time Olympic gold medalist"".
* **D: 柔道专家 (Judoka expert):** While he *was* undoubtedly an expert, the text doesn't *list* this as one of his formal honors or titles. It describes his achievements as a champion and a chairman, not simply his expertise.

Therefore, the answer is **D**."
岩崎避免在哪里立誓？,"The correct answer is **B: 尼泊尔**.

The passage states 岩崎 ""在尼泊尔逃婚"" (escaped from a marriage in Nepal). This implies he was trying to *avoid* a commitment (like a vow or oath made during a wedding) in Nepal.

The other options are incorrect because the passage only mentions trouble *happening* to him in those locations, not avoiding something specifically:

*   **A: 日本** - Nothing in the passage suggests he avoided anything in Japan.
*   **C: 印度** - He was arrested in India, but not avoiding a vow.
*   **D: 西藏** - He was attacked by a dog in Tibet, but not avoiding a vow.



"
谁袭击了岩崎？,"The correct answer is **C: 一只狗 (a dog)**.

The passage states: ""他曾在西藏被疯狗袭击"" which translates to ""He was attacked by a rabid dog in Tibet.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 他的未婚配偶 (his fiancee)** - He *escaped from* a wedding in Nepal, implying he was running *from* his fiancee, not being attacked *by* them.
*   **B: 海盗 (pirates)** - He was *robbed* by pirates, not attacked.
*   **D: 警察 (police)** - He was *arrested* by the police, not attacked."
阿隆索在什么时候退出了比赛？,"The correct answer is **A: 在舒马赫损坏前轮之后** (After Schumacher damaged his front wheel).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""费尔南多·阿隆索...但却在进站后就退出了比赛，大概是因为其右前轮实在塞得厉害。"" (Fernando Alonso...but retired from the race after a pit stop, likely due to a severely stuck right front wheel.)  And then it says: ""迈克尔·舒马赫在阿隆索退赛后不久也退出了比赛..."" (Michael Schumacher retired from the race shortly after Alonso retired...)

This clearly shows Alonso retired *before* Schumacher. The description of Alonso’s issue is a right front wheel issue, which corresponds to Schumacher's damaged front wheel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 费斯切拉失去了对赛车的把控** (Fisichella lost control of the car) - This refers to Fisichella's retirement, not Alonso's.
*   **C: 在舒马赫退出比赛之后** (After Schumacher retired) - Incorrect, as Alonso retired *before* Schumacher.
*   **D: 在领先之前** (Before leading) - The passage states Alonso led for most of the race, so he definitely didn't retire before leading.



"
是什么导致舒马赫提前退出比赛？,"The correct answer is **D: 汽车悬架损伤 (Automobile suspension damage)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""迈克尔·舒马赫在阿隆索退赛后不久也退出了比赛，因为在比赛的多次竞逐中，悬架受到了损伤。"" (Michael Schumacher also retired from the race shortly after Alonso, because the suspension was damaged in multiple contests during the race.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 他失去了对赛车的把控 (He lost control of the car)** - This describes what happened to Fisichella, not Schumacher.
* **B: 与阿隆索碰撞 (Collision with Alonso)** - The passage doesn't mention any collision between Schumacher and Alonso.
* **C: 费斯切拉造成车轮损坏 (Fisichella caused wheel damage)** - The passage says Alonso's wheel was badly fitted, not that Fisichella caused the damage.



"
根据这段文字，谁负责为被捕者设定保释金？,"The correct answer is **D: 法庭专员**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""如果获得批准，法庭专员即可设定保释金，并最终确定执行逮捕的警员提出的指控.""  This directly links the responsibility of setting bail to the court commissioner.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 执行逮捕的警员 (The officer making the arrest):** The text says they *propose* the charges, but the commissioner decides on bail.
* **B: 格林法官 (Judge Green):** Judge Green issued the injunction *requiring* the hearings, but doesn't set the bail themselves.
* **C: 中央拘留所 (Central Detention Facility):** The facility is the place where people are held, not the entity setting bail.



"
根据这段文字提到的临时禁令，被捕者必须具备什么条件才能被关押超过 24 小时？,"The correct answer is **D: 听证会**.

Here's why:

The passage states the temporary injunction *forces release* of those held over 24 hours *without* a court commissioner hearing. This means a hearing is **required** to legally hold someone beyond 24 hours.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 保释金** - The hearing *can* set bail, but bail isn't a requirement *to be held* for more than 24 hours, the hearing is.
*   **B: 与执行逮捕的警员见面** - The passage mentions the arresting officer's charges being entered, but doesn't say a meeting is required for continued detention.
*   **C: 格林法官发出正式指控** - The hearing determines if charges are valid, but the judge didn't issue the charges, the arresting officer did. Also, a formal charge isn't needed to justify holding someone for longer than 24 hours, *a hearing is*.



"
根据这段文字，哪个原因没有被用来解释为什么取消第二轮选举？,"The correct answer is **B: 违反宪法**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""This contradicts earlier reports that cancelling the runoff was unconstitutional."" This means the text *explicitly* points out that the idea of the cancellation being unconstitutional is something they are moving *away* from as a reason.  It's presented as a previously held belief that is now being challenged.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned as reasons:

* **A: 安全风险 (Security risks):** The text directly states Lodin said the decision was made ""to avoid the security risks of another election.""
* **C: 开支高昂 (High costs):** The text says Lodin mentioned cancelling the election ""to save Afghans the expense of another election.""
* **D: 宪法有歧义 (Ambiguity in the constitution):** Diplomats found ""enough ambiguity in the Afghan constitution...making a runoff unnecessary.""

Therefore, the only option *not* used as an explanation is that the cancellation was unconstitutional.



"
为什么外交官们最终认为不需要进行第二轮选举？,"The correct answer is **C: 宪法存在歧义 (The constitution has ambiguities)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""外交官们表示在阿富汗宪法中发现了足够多的歧义，因此没有必要举办决胜选举 (Diplomats said they found enough ambiguities in the Afghan constitution, so there was no need to hold a runoff election).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 它违反了宪法 (It violates the constitution):** The passage actually states the initial reports claimed cancellation *would* violate the constitution, but the diplomats found a way around this.
*   **B: 存在安全风险 (There are security risks):** While Lodin mentioned security risks as a reason for cancellation, it wasn't the reason *diplomats* gave for finding a runoff unnecessary.
*   **D: 选举过于昂贵 (The election is too expensive):** Lodin mentioned cost savings, but again, this wasn't the diplomats' reasoning.



"
谁为 FATA 提供司法服务？,"The correct answer is **B: 政治代理 (Political Agents)**.

The passage states: ""These agents were responsible for providing government and judicial services... under Article 247 of the Pakistan Constitution."" Therefore, political agents are the ones who provide judicial services in FATA.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 巴基斯坦政府 (Pakistan Government):** While ultimately the government is responsible, the *agents* are the ones *providing* the services.
*   **C: 巴基斯坦总统 (Pakistan President):** The president *appoints* the agents, but doesn't directly provide the services.
*   **D: 英国政府 (British Government):** Pakistan is independent from British rule since 1947."
关于 FATA 的“政治代理”，以下哪项陈述不正确？,"The correct answer is **D: They have complete control over certain areas**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states political agents provide government and judicial services (A & C are correct).** It also explicitly says they are *appointed* by the President (B is correct).
* **However, the passage states FATA has *almost complete autonomy*.** This implies the political agents do *not* have complete control, but rather administer services *within* a largely self-governing region. They operate *under* the framework of the constitution, providing services *according to* Article 247, not exercising unchecked authority.

Therefore, option D is the incorrect statement.



"
艾玛·斯通被提名哪个奖项？,"The correct answer is **C: 最佳女主角**.

The text specifically states: ""高斯林和斯通分别获得了最佳男主角和最佳女主角的提名."" (Gosling and Stone were nominated for Best Actor and Best Actress respectively.)
"
电影没有被提名哪个奖项？,"The correct answer is **B: 最佳视觉效果**.

The passage lists all the nominations the movie received, and ""best visual effects"" is *not* among them. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 最佳影片 (Best Picture)** - The movie *was* nominated for Best Picture.
* **C: 最佳混音 (Best Sound Mixing)** - The movie *was* nominated for Best Sound Mixing.
* **D: 最佳原创配乐 (Best Original Score)** - The movie *was* nominated for Best Original Score.



"
地震后以下哪里保持运行？,"The correct answer is **D: 新泻的一个发电厂** (A power plant in Niigata).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""日本广播协会 (NHK) 还报道说，位于新泻县的柏崎刈羽 (Kashiwazaki Kariwa) 核电站运行正常。"" (NHK also reported that the Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata Prefecture is operating normally.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 北陆电力的志贺核能发电厂的所有反应堆** (All reactors of Hokuriku Electric Power's Shiga Nuclear Power Plant): The passage specifically says reactors 1 & 2 *were shut down*.
* **B: 石川的机场** (Ishikawa's airport): The passage says the Noto Airport in Ishikawa *remains closed*.
* **C: 所有铁路服务** (All railway services): The passage states railway services *are disrupted*.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪里因地震而受到损坏？,"The correct answer is **C: 一些道路 (Some roads)**.

Here's why:

* The text specifically states: ""一些道路受到了损坏 (Some roads were damaged).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 一些房屋 (Some houses):** The text doesn't mention damage to houses.
* **B: 志贺核能发电厂的两个反应堆 (Two reactors of the Shiga Nuclear Power Plant):** The text states the reactors were *shut down* but not *damaged*. It says the earthquake had no effect on them.
* **D: 能登机场 (Noto Airport):** The text says the airport is *closed*, but not that it was damaged. It's closed as a result of the situation, but no damage is specified.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪个问题不包含在该文件中？,"The correct answer is **B: 1967 年战争的原因**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    * **Jerusalem's future status (A)** - ""...the future status of Jerusalem, holy to both countries...""
    * **Military presence in the valley (C)** - ""...Israel requests a ten-year military deployment in the valley... Palestine Liberation Organization agrees to five years.""
    * **Border dispute (D)** - ""...the document will address the border dispute, with Palestinians hoping for borders based on those before the 1967 Middle East War.""

* **The passage does *not* mention the *reasons* for the 1967 war.** It only references the year 1967 as a baseline for border discussions.

Therefore, the question not contained in the document (according to the text) is the cause of the 1967 war.



"
以下哪项不是巴勒斯坦的要求之一？,"The correct answer is **B: 约旦河谷的持续军事力量存在**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""以色列要求协议签订后，在山谷中部署十年的军事力量，而巴勒斯坦民族权力机构只同意保留五年。"" (Israel requests a ten-year military presence in the valley after the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to five years.) This means *Israel* wants the continued military presence, not Palestine.
*   **The passage states Palestine wants:**
    *   Boundaries based on the pre-1967 borders.
    *   Discussion about the future status of Jerusalem.
    *   They agreed to a *five-year* military presence in the Jordan Valley (although they preferred none).

Therefore, a *continued* military presence is not a Palestinian request.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 基于战前情况的边界 (Boundaries based on the pre-1967 borders)** - The passage explicitly states Palestine wants this.
*   **C: 关于耶路撒冷未来的答案 (An answer about the future of Jerusalem)** - The passage says this is a topic of discussion Palestine wants addressed.
*   **D: 约旦河谷的五年军事力量存在 (A five-year military presence in the Jordan Valley)** - Palestine agreed to this as a compromise."
马曾在哪个国家/地区学习法律？,"The correct answer is **A: 美国**.

The text states 马英九 (Ma Ying-jeou) studied at New York University and Harvard Law School, both located in the United States. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 中国** - The text mentions a desire for *closer ties* with China, but not studying there.
* **C: 澳大利亚** -  The text doesn't mention Australia.
* **D: 香港** - The text states he was *born* in Hong Kong, but studied law elsewhere.



"
根据这段文字，对哪个国家/地区的主张有助于马当选？,"The correct answer is **D: 中国 (China)**.

Here's why:

The text states that 馬英九 (Ma Ying-jeou) ""主张与中国大陆建立更加紧密的联系 (advocated for closer ties with mainland China)"" and then ""轻松获胜 (easily won)"". This directly implies that his pro-China stance *helped* him get elected.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 美国 (United States)** - While he studied in the US and held a green card, the text doesn't suggest a pro-US stance helped him win. In fact, it highlights criticism suggesting he might *flee to* the US during a crisis, which is negative.
*   **B: 香港 (Hong Kong)** - He was born in Hong Kong, but this isn't presented as a factor in his electoral success.
*   **C: 英国 (United Kingdom)** - The text makes no mention of the UK.



"
根据这段文字，卡罗琳·威尔逊在溜出城之前曾为谁工作？,"The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

Here's why:

The text states ""...OHA 的卡罗琳·威尔逊私吞了他们的押金，溜出城去了。"" which translates to ""...Caroline Wilson of OHA embezzled their deposits and fled the city.""

This directly indicates that Caroline Wilson was working for OHA (Oakland Housing Authority) before leaving.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 东湾社区法律中心 (East Bay Community Law Center)** - The text states the law center *helped* victims, it doesn't say Wilson worked there.
*   **B: 奥克兰警察局 (Oakland Police Department)** - The police are *investigating* the fraud, but Wilson wasn't one of them.
*   **D: Lockwood Gardens** - Lockwood Gardens is where the tenants live; Wilson didn't work there.



"
在赛季剩余四场比赛中，谁在车手积分榜上排名第四？,"The correct answer is **D: 鲍耶**.

Here's why:

* **Hamlin is third** with 2230 points.
* **Kahne is fifth** with 2220 points.
* **Stewart, Gordon, Kenseth, and Harvick** are in the top ten, but their exact order isn't given.
* The text states Hamlin is *leading Boyer by five points*. Therefore Boyer must be in fourth place.

"
在文中提到的比赛之后，卡纳在车手积分榜中获得多少分？,"The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The text states: ""卡纳 (Kahne) 和小楚克斯 (Truex, Jr.) 分别以 2,220 和 2,207 分位列第五和第六.""  Therefore, Kahne has 2220 points."
根据这段文字，人们目击到落下的陨石后被证实为来自火星的有多少次？,"The correct answer is **B: Five times**.

The passage states: ""This is considered the fifth time in human history that material from Mars has been observed to fall to Earth and chemically confirmed.""

Therefore, the answer is five."
在文章中提到的来自火星的岩石，哪个说法是正确的？,"The correct answer is **D: 有 34 块 (There are 34 of them)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""In the approximately 24,000 meteorites that have fallen to Earth, only 34 have been verified as being from Mars.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 所有这些岩石都是在七月份的流星雨期间发现的 (All of these rocks were discovered during the July meteor shower):**  The passage says *fifteen* of the rocks came from the July meteor shower, not all of them.
* **B: 有 24,000 块 (There are 24,000 of them):**  This refers to the total number of meteorites found on Earth, not just the Martian ones.
* **C: 它们的价值比黄金高 11,000 美元 (They are worth $11,000 more than gold):** The passage says they are worth *up to ten times* the price of gold, not specifically $11,000 more.  The price range is $11,000 - $22,500 *per ounce*, which is significantly higher than gold.



"
舒马赫是什么时候退役的？,"The correct answer is **B: 在第七次夺得冠军后** (After winning his seventh championship).

The passage states: ""在赢得一级方程式赛车锦标赛 (Formula 1) 总冠军七次后于 2006 年退役的名将舒马赫 (Schumacher)..."" which translates to ""Legendary Schumacher, after winning the Formula 1 championship seven times, retired in 2006...""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** His retirement wasn't *because* of Massa's accident, it was *before* it.
*   **C:** He retired before replacing Massa.
*   **D:** He retired in 2006, not at the end of the 2009 season.



"
马萨是什么时候受伤的？,"The correct answer is **A: 在一次大奖赛期间 (During a Grand Prix)**.

The passage specifically states Massa was injured ""during the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix"". 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 在赢得一级方程式赛车锦标赛冠军后 (After winning the Formula 1 championship)** - The passage doesn't link his injury to winning a championship.
* **C: 在舒马赫退役之前 (Before Schumacher retired)** - Schumacher retired in 2006, and Massa was injured in 2009.
* **D: 在 2009 赛季之前 (Before the 2009 season)** - He was injured *during* the 2009 season.



"
根据这段文字，这项安排将如何影响 AOL？,"The correct answer is **C: AOL 将成为用户数量与雅虎和微软的用户数量不相上下**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""The combined users of Yahoo and Microsoft services are comparable to America Online’s customer base.""  And that ""this freedom [to develop the instant messaging market at its own pace] may be coming to an end.""
* **This means:**  The competition from Yahoo and Microsoft will likely bring AOL's user base down to a similar level as theirs, ending AOL's dominance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: AOL 的用户数量可能会增加 (AOL's user numbers may increase):** The passage suggests the *opposite* – that AOL's freedom to grow unchecked is ending due to competition.
* **B: AOL 将成为唯一开发即时通讯市场的公司 (AOL will become the only company developing the instant messaging market):** The passage clearly states that Yahoo and Microsoft are also players in this market.
* **D: AOL 将不再在美国使用 (AOL will no longer be used in the US):** The passage doesn’t suggest AOL will disappear, just that its dominance will be challenged.



"
以下哪一项可能因新的安排而结束？,"The correct answer is **C: AOL 按照自己的节奏开发市场的自由**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""In such an arrangement, this freedom may be about to end.""  The ""this freedom"" refers to AOL's ability to ""proceed and develop the instant messaging market at its own pace"" due to its widespread use.
* **The passage explains:** AOL previously had dominance (""widely prevalent"") allowing them to control the market's development. Now, Yahoo and Microsoft are catching up (""their combined users are comparable to America Online's customer base""), threatening that control.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 在美国广泛的互联网发展 (Widespread internet development in the US):** The passage doesn't suggest internet development itself is ending.
* **B: 即时通讯市场的使用 (Use of the instant messaging market):** The passage doesn't say people will stop using instant messaging. It's about *who* controls the market.
* **D: 雅虎和微软的合作 (Yahoo and Microsoft's cooperation):** The passage mentions Yahoo and Microsoft but doesn't focus on their cooperation ending – it's about the impact of their combined user base on AOL.



"
在袭击中有多少死者不是警察？,"The correct answer is **C: 0**.

Here's why:

* The passage states **two** police officers died.
* It doesn't mention any other deaths.
* Therefore, zero people who were *not* police officers died in the attack.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: 19** - This is the number of *injured* police officers, not deaths.
* **B: 2** - This is the number of police officer deaths.
* **D: 20** - This is the total number of people injured, not deaths.



"
谁报告了袭击的嫌疑人？,"The correct answer is **A: 警方 (Police)**.

The passage states: ""警方说他们怀疑一名疑似伊斯兰国 (ISIL) 的武装分子发动了这场袭击。"" which translates to ""Police said they suspect an ISIS militant carried out the attack."" 

Therefore, the police reported the suspected perpetrator.
"
由于佛罗里达州是一个“赢者通吃”的州，米特·罗姆尼获得了什？,"The correct answer is **C: 该州的全部选举代表票**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""As a ‘winner-take-all’ state, Florida awarded all 50 of its electoral votes to Romney...""  (Note: the passage says 50 electoral votes, not 32. This is likely a typo and should be 50.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 该州的 32 张选举代表票** - This is the percentage of votes Gingrich received, not what Romney won.
* **B: 共和党提名** - Winning Florida puts Romney *in the lead* for the nomination, but doesn't guarantee it.
* **D: 46% 的选票** - This is the *percentage* of votes Romney received, not what he *gained* as a result of the ""winner-take-all"" system.



"
根据这段文字，金里奇在初选中获得了多少选票？,"The correct answer is **B: 32%**.

The text explicitly states: ""Newt Gingrich received 32 percent of the vote, finishing second.""
"
根据这段文字，谁在党团会议的结果公布后没有继续竞选？,"The correct answer is **B: 巴赫曼 (Bachmann)**.

The text states: ""巴赫曼决定退出竞选 (Bachmann decided to drop out of the race)."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 金里奇 (Gingrich)** - He praised Santorum and criticized Romney, and even had ads run against him, but *did not* drop out.
* **C: 佩里 (Perry)** - He considered dropping out, but ultimately decided to continue.
* **D: 罗姆尼 (Romney)** - He was criticized by Gingrich and had ads run against him, but continued campaigning.



"
根据这段文字，谁在党团会议的结果公布后对另一位候选人连连称赞？,"The correct answer is **B: 金里奇 (Gingrich)**.

The text states: ""金里奇连连称赞桑托勒姆 (Gingrich repeatedly praised Santorum)..."" 

The question asks who praised *another* candidate after the results, and Gingrich is the one described as doing so.
"
在 2015 年之前，这个节目仅在哪里播出？,"The correct answer is **A: TogiNet Radio**.

The passage states: ""Early on, the show aired exclusively on the long-running internet radio site TogiNet Radio..."" This directly answers the question.
"
该电台描述这档节目有什么样的风格？,"The correct answer is **B: 极客的** (Geeky).

The passage explicitly states the program is described as having a ""全新震撼**极客风格**的老式广播剧！” (a “new, shocking **geek-styled** old-time radio show!”).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 业余的** (Amateur) - While the actors *were* initially amateur, that's a description of *who* performed in it, not the style of the show itself.
*   **C: 老派的** (Old-fashioned) -  The show *is* described as ""old-time radio drama,"" but ""geek-styled"" is the specific style highlighted.
*   **D: 当地的** (Local) - The actors came from local areas, but this doesn't define the show’s style.



"
戴维·黑德利收集了什么信息，最终帮助了激进组织的袭击？,"The correct answer is **A: 信息 (Information)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that David Headley's ""reconnaissance and intelligence gathering"" (which means collecting information) enabled the attack. The other options are *tools used in* the attack, not what Headley *provided* to help it happen.

*   **B, C, and D** are all elements *of* the attack itself, carried by the gunmen, not what Headley supplied.



"
激进组织使用哪种交通工具前往孟买？,"The correct answer is **C: 船**.

The passage states: ""孟买袭击者带着手榴弹和自动武器乘**船**抵达."" (The Mumbai attackers arrived by **boat** with hand grenades and automatic weapons.)
"
哪项陈述准确反映了文章中提到的纳达尔和拉奥尼奇的布里斯班公开赛比赛的结果？,"The correct answer is **A: 拉奥尼奇击败了纳达尔 (Raonic defeated Nadal)**.

The text states: ""不久前，他在布里斯班公开赛上败于拉奥尼奇 (Recently, he lost to Raonic at the Brisbane Open)."" This directly indicates Raonic won the match against Nadal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 拉奥尼奇有 88% 的净胜分 (Raonic had 88% net points won)** - The text says Nadal had 88% net points won, not Raonic.
* **C: 纳达尔击败了拉奥尼奇 (Nadal defeated Raonic)** - The text explicitly states Nadal *lost* to Raonic.
* **D: 拉奥尼奇赢得 76 分 (Raonic won 76 points)** - The text says Nadal won 76 points on his first serve, not Raonic.



"
根据这段文字，纳达尔和拉奥尼奇在第一个发球局后的排名是什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 拉奥尼奇击败了纳达尔**.

Here's why:

The text states ""不久前，他在布里斯班公开赛上败于拉奥尼奇"" (Not long ago, he lost to Raonic at the Brisbane Open). This directly indicates that Raonic defeated Nadal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 拉奥尼奇有 88% 的净胜分** - The text says Nadal had 88% net points won, not Raonic.
*   **B: 纳达尔赢得 76 分** - The text says Nadal won 76 points on his first serve, but this doesn't relate to the overall ranking after the match with Raonic.
*   **C: 比分是 7-2** - This refers to Nadal's overall record against *Canadians* generally, not specifically the result of his match against Raonic.



"
以下哪种语言节目不包括在裸体新闻三档新的广播节目中？,"The correct answer is **C: 日语**.

The passage states Naked News *already* uses English and Japanese, and is *adding* Spanish, Italian, and Korean. Therefore, Japanese is not one of the *new* programs."
根据这段文字，新的裸体新闻广播将不会在哪里播出？,"The correct answer is **C: 剧院**.

The passage states the new broadcasts will be for television, the web (internet), and mobile devices. It doesn't mention any plans for broadcasts in theaters.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 手机 (Mobile)** - The passage explicitly states broadcasts will be on ""mobile devices"".
*   **B: 互联网 (Internet)** - The passage explicitly states broadcasts will be on ""the web"".
*   **D: 电视 (Television)** - The passage explicitly states broadcasts will be on ""television""."
有多少名选手没有完成大回转比赛？,"The question asks how many skiers did not finish the Giant Slalom race. The text states that ""four skiers in the women's sitting group did not finish"" *and* ""45 skiers out of the 117 entrants in the Giant Slalom did not make the list"" (meaning they did not finish or place).  The question isn't specific about *which* skiers didn't finish, just the total. Therefore, the correct answer is 45.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: 45**
"
以下哪项陈述准确反映了锦标赛的比赛结果？,"Let's analyze each option based on the provided text:

* **A: 在第二场比赛中，卡帕内多在匈牙利滑雪选手之前完成比赛** - This translates to ""In the second competition, Carpanedo finished before the Hungarian skier."" The text states Carpanedo was 1:09.02 *slower* than the Hungarian skier (巩基·达尼), meaning she finished *after* them. So this is incorrect.

* **B: 有 45 名滑雪选手在大回转比赛中未能完赛** - This translates to ""45 skiers did not finish the Giant Slalom."" The text states 45 skiers didn't *make it onto the ranking list* in Giant Slalom, not that they didn't finish the race.  It also says 4 in the sit group didn’t finish. While related, it’s not exactly what the text states.

* **C: 完成大回转的滑雪选手多于障碍滑雪的选手** - This translates to ""More skiers completed the Giant Slalom than the Slalom."" 117 skiers started Giant Slalom and 45 didn't make the ranking (meaning they *did* finish, but weren't ranked). Therefore 117 - 45 = 72 skiers were ranked. In Slalom, 116 skiers started and 36 had ""did not finish"" (DNF), meaning 116 - 36 = 80 skiers finished.  Therefore this is **incorrect**, 80 is more than 72.

* **D: 卡帕内多在障碍滑雪比赛中名列第十** - This translates to ""Carpanedo finished tenth in the Slalom competition."" The text clearly states she finished with ""did not finish"" (DNF). So this is incorrect.

Let's re-examine option B. The text states: ""大回转项目（Giant Slalom）的 117 名选手中有 45 人未能挤进榜单。"" While ""未能挤进榜单"" doesn't *literally* mean ""did not finish,"" in the context of a ski race, it strongly implies they didn't complete the course successfully enough to be ranked. It's the closest accurate statement.

Therefore, the best answer is **B**.



"
美国国家篮球协会 (NBA) 决定暂停以下哪项？,"The correct answer is **A: 篮球赛季** (Basketball season).

The passage explicitly states that the NBA ""paused the professional basketball season."" The other options refer to elements *related* to the pause, but not what was actually paused.
"
根据这段文字，是什么导致了 NBA 对该病毒的担忧？,"The correct answer is **D: 犹他爵士队的一名球员检测呈阳性 (Utah Jazz player tested positive)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""犹他爵士队的一名球员新冠肺炎病毒检测呈阳性，NBA 随即做出了这项决定 (A Utah Jazz player tested positive for the coronavirus, prompting the NBA to make this decision).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: NBA 成员检测呈阳性 (NBA members tested positive)** - This is too broad. The text specifically mentions *one* player.
* **B: 几名球员在犹他爵士队比赛中检测呈阳性 (Several players tested positive during a Utah Jazz game)** - The text only states one player.
* **C: 犹他爵士队的一名球员在检测呈阳性后表现不佳 (A Utah Jazz player tested positive and then performed poorly)** - The text doesn't mention anything about the player's performance.



"
在对阵亚特兰大鸫鸟队的比赛中，谁为华盛顿首都队打进了致胜一球？,"The correct answer is **A: 尼克拉斯·贝克斯特伦 (Nicklas Backstrom)**.

The passage states: ""奥韦奇金（Ovechkin）当晚的第一个助攻，来自新秀尼克拉斯·贝克斯特伦 (Nicklas Backstrom) 的制胜一球"" which translates to ""Ovechkin's first assist of the night came on the game-winning goal by rookie Nicklas Backstrom.""
"
在首都队对阵鸫鸟队的比赛中，谁打进了他的第 60 个赛季进球？,"The correct answer is **C: 亚历克斯·奥韦奇金 (Alex Ovechkin)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""他当晚的第二个进球是他本赛季的第60个进球..."" (His second goal of the night was his 60th goal of the season...).

The other options are incorrect because the passage mentions Jagr and Lemieux as having scored 60 goals in a season *before* Ovechkin, but doesn't say they scored the 60th goal in this particular game. Backstrom is mentioned as assisting on a goal, not scoring one.



"
北岩银行在什么时候需要政府支持？,"The correct answer is **D: 在次贷危机期间 (During the subprime mortgage crisis)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""由于在 2007 年次贷危机期间遭到曝光，北岩银行 (Northern Rock) 曾请求政府提供援助。"" (Because it was exposed during the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis, Northern Rock requested government assistance.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 在银行被国有化后 (After the bank was nationalized)** - The bank *received* support leading *up* to nationalization, not after.
*   **B: 银行从资产管理公司剥离后 (After the bank was separated from the asset management company)** - This happened *after* initial support was sought.
*   **C: 在维珍集团收购该银行后 (After Virgin Group acquired the bank)** - Virgin Group *didn't* acquire the bank, and the need for support predated any offer from them.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项陈述准确地描述了维珍集团与北岩银行的交易？,"The correct answer is **B: 维珍集团在银行国有化后收购了该银行**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""维珍集团只收购了北岩银行“好的部分”，没有收购其资产管理公司。"" This eliminates option A.
* The text says Virgin Group made an offer *before* nationalization, but was rejected. It then clarifies they *did* acquire part of Northern Rock *after* it was nationalized. This eliminates options C and D. 

Therefore, option B accurately reflects the information provided in the text – Virgin Group acquired a portion of Northern Rock *after* the bank was nationalized.



"
根据这段文字，哪个国家受到了《京都气候议定书》签署的影响？,"The correct answer is **C: 澳大利亚**.

Here's why:

The text states that the *previous* conservative government of Australia refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol because they believed it would harm Australia's economy due to its reliance on coal exports.  While the text mentions India and China *not* being bound by emission targets, it specifically details the impact on Australia. Kevin Rudd's decision to sign the protocol is framed *in contrast* to the previous Australian government's stance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 美国 (United States)** - The text states the US is the only *developed* country not to sign, but doesn't describe it being *affected* by the signing.
*   **B: 印度 (India)** - The text states India isn't bound by emission targets, but doesn't say it's affected by the signing.
*   **D: 中国 (China)** - Similar to India, China isn't bound by emission targets, but isn't described as being affected.



"
根据这段文字所述，澳大利亚前政府认为批准《京都气候议定书》会对什么造成伤害？,"The correct answer is **B: 该国经济 (the country's economy)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""澳大利亚前保守党政府拒绝签署《京都议定书》，声称由于澳大利亚严重依赖煤炭出口，该协议会**削弱澳大利亚的经济**。"" (Australia's previous conservative government refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol, claiming that the agreement would **weaken Australia's economy** due to Australia's heavy reliance on coal exports.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 美国 (United States):** The passage says the US was the only developed country *not* signing, not that the Kyoto Protocol would harm the US.
*   **C: 煤炭出口 (coal exports):** While coal exports were the *reason* the government feared economic damage, the damage itself was to the overall economy.
*   **D: 该国排放目标 (the country's emission targets):** The passage states they objected because of the economic impact, not because of the emission targets themselves.



"
枪手在哪个项目中被招募？,"The correct answer is **D: 射击运动员协会的狩猎计划**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""射击运动员协会为狩猎计划招募了合格的志愿者."" (The shooting association recruited qualified volunteers for the hunting program.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 澳大利亚射击运动员协会计划** - This is too broad. It's a *part* of the association's work, but the specific recruitment was for the hunting program.
* **B: 公园保护和遗产管理计划** -  This is where Mick O'flynn works, but the *recruitment* was done by the shooting association.
* **C: 澳大利亚新州国家公园和野生动物服务中心计划** - While NPWS is involved in the overall project, they didn't do the recruiting.



"
以下哪项陈述没有准确地反映虫害防治试验？,"The correct answer is **A: 由于这是该计划的第一次试验，因此没有进行评估**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""试验会受到监测，并会评估其效果。"" (The trial will be monitored, and its effectiveness will be evaluated.) This directly contradicts option A.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: 枪手接受了培训指导** - ""选中参与第一次射击行动的四名枪手均已接受全面的安全及培训指导。"" (The four shooters selected for the first shooting action had all received comprehensive safety and training instruction.)
* **C: 枪手受到护林员的监督** - ""护林员会密切监督参加虫害防治补充试验的射手..."" (Rangers will closely supervise the shooters participating in the pest control supplementary trial...)
* **D: 选择了四名枪手** - ""选中参与第一次射击行动的四名枪手..."" (The four shooters selected for the first shooting action...)

Therefore, only option A is not accurately reflected in the text.



"
根据这段文字，分裂在哪里被发现？,"The correct answer is **D: 在埃塞俄比亚**.

Here's why:

* The text specifically states the research was done by researchers at the ""Ethiopian Rift Valley Research Institute"" and the fossil was found *in* the Ethiopian Rift Valley.  The quote references findings *based on* the fossil, but the location of the discovery is Ethiopia.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 在裂谷中 (In the rift valley)** - While true, it's not the *most* specific answer the text provides. It tells us *which* rift valley.
* **B: 在一块化石上 (On a fossil)** - The split isn't *on* the fossil, the fossil *provides evidence* of the split.
* **C: 在分子证据中 (In molecular evidence)** - The text states the split is *earlier than* predicted by molecular evidence, it wasn't found *in* it.



"
根据这段文字，什么比预计更早地发生了？,"The correct answer is **B: 分裂 (Splitting)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""According to this fossil, it means splitting occurred much earlier than predicted by molecular evidence.""

This directly tells us that the *splitting* (likely referring to a divergence event in evolutionary history) happened earlier than expected.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 化石的发现 (The discovery of the fossil)** - While the fossil *led* to the realization, the fossil itself didn't happen earlier than predicted. It's the event the fossil reveals that did.
*   **C: 分子证据的分析 (Analysis of molecular evidence)** - The passage says the splitting is earlier than *predicted by* molecular evidence, not that the analysis itself is early.
*   **D: 在裂谷的研究 (Research in the rift valley)** -  The research is happening *because of* the fossil, but the research isn't the thing that happened earlier.



"
玩家为了在电子游戏中操作动作需要做什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 在空中移动控制器 (In the air move the controller)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""It lets players control movements and actions in video games by **moving the device through the air**."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 确保控制器的传感器靠近游戏主机 (Ensure the controller's sensor is close to the game console):** The sensors are near the *TV*, not the console.
* **B: 三角测量他们的位置 (Triangulate their position):**  While triangulation is *how* it works, the question asks what the *player* needs to do.
* **C: 将传感器放在电视机附近 (Place the sensors near the TV):** This is a setup step, not what the player does to *operate* actions in the game.



"
什么被设计成类似电视遥控器？,"The correct answer is **B: 任天堂 Revolution 控制器**.

The passage states: ""该控制器类似于电视遥控器..."" (This controller is similar to a TV remote control...). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 控制器的两个传感器 (The controller's two sensors):** The sensors *help* with the controller's function, but aren't designed to *look* like a remote.
* **C: 主题演讲 (Keynote speech):** The speech announced the controller, it wasn't designed to look like a remote.
* **D: 任天堂 Revolution 游戏主机 (Nintendo Revolution game console):** The console itself isn't described as looking like a remote, it's the controller.



"
新华社最新报道中没有陈述什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 飞机降落在乌鲁木齐 (The plane landed in Urumqi)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the plane was *denied* emergency landing in Urumqi.** This means it *didn't* land there.  The other options are all explicitly stated as happening according to the news reports.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 飞机收到了炸弹威胁 (The plane received a bomb threat)** - The passage *does* state this.
* **C: 飞机被迫返回阿富汗 (The plane was forced to return to Afghanistan)** - The passage *does* state this.
* **D: 飞机降落在坎大哈 (The plane landed in Kandahar)** - The passage *does* state this.



"
新华社最早的报道中没有陈述什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 飞机收到了炸弹威胁 (The plane received a bomb threat)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""随后的报道称，这架飞机受到炸弹威胁，被迫返回阿富汗，降落在坎大哈."" (Subsequent reports said the plane was threatened with a bomb and forced to return to Afghanistan, landing in Kandahar.)  This indicates the bomb threat was *later* information.
* **The earliest report (according to the passage) stated:** a plane had been hijacked and then returned to Afghanistan after being denied emergency landing in Urumqi.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 飞机被劫持 (The plane was hijacked)** - This *was* in the earliest report.
* **B: 飞机被拒绝紧急降落 (The plane was refused emergency landing)** - This *was* in the earliest report.
* **C: 飞机被迫返回阿富汗 (The plane was forced to return to Afghanistan)** - This *was* in the earliest report.



"
萨拉·丹尼尔斯在广播节目中宣布了什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 委员会将停止与鲍勃·迪伦取得联系的努力** (The committee will stop efforts to reach Bob Dylan).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the committee has ""given up trying to reach him"" (鲍勃·迪伦) after being unable to directly contact him.  They are now ""keeping still"" (按兵不动).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 诺贝尔文学奖获奖者 (Nobel Literature Prize winner)** - While the passage *relates* to the prize winner, it doesn't announce *who* the winner is, only the difficulty in contacting them.
* **B: 委员会没有收到合作者的回复 (The committee did not receive a reply from collaborators)** - The passage actually states they *did* receive ""very friendly replies.""
* **C: 2016 年诺贝尔文学奖提名 (2016 Nobel Literature Prize nominations)** - The passage discusses the *award*, not the nominations.



"
谁无法联系到？,"The correct answer is **D: 鲍勃·迪伦**.

The passage explicitly states the Nobel Committee was unable to contact **Bob Dylan** to inform him of his award. While they contacted his collaborators, the issue is their inability to reach *him* directly. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 鲍勃·迪伦的亲密合作者 (Bob Dylan's close collaborators)** - They *were* contacted.
* **B: 萨拉·丹尼尔斯 (Sara Danius)** - She is the one *doing* the contacting.
* **C: 瑞典学院 (The Swedish Academy)** - They are the organization trying to contact him, not the one unable to be reached.



"
谁评论该承诺是“重要一步”？,"The correct answer is **C: 戈登·约翰德罗 (Gordon Johndroe)**.

The passage specifically states: ""布什政府发言人戈登·约翰德罗 (Gordon Johndroe) 称朝鲜的承诺是""""朝着实现朝鲜半岛可核查的无核化目标迈出的重要一步""""."" 

This directly indicates that Gordon Johndroe was the one who made the comment.
"
斯拉尼亚为各国制作了多少张邮票？,"The correct answer is **B: 1000 张**.

The passage states: ""He created over 1000 different stamp designs for Sweden and 28 other countries."" 

Therefore, the answer is 1000."
根据这段文字，什么是油箱持续泄漏的可能原因？,"The correct answer is **C: 热膨胀 (Thermal expansion)**.

The text specifically states: ""截至周三下午，油箱的排气口仍在漏油，这很可能是由油箱内部的热膨胀造成的。"" (As of Wednesday afternoon, the tank's vent was still leaking, likely due to thermal expansion inside the tank.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 二级防泄漏围护区被填满 (Secondary containment area being filled):** The text says the secondary containment area is *not* yet full.
* **B: 消防指挥系统例行测试 (Fire command system routine test):** This *caused* the initial problem, but isn't the reason for the *continued* leak from the vent.
* **D: 格里利堡的泵站着火 (Fort Greely pump station on fire):** The text does not mention any fire.



"
为什么安全阀开启？,"The correct answer is **B: 系统测试后发生电力故障**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""消防指挥系统的例行测试引发了一场电力故障，故障使得安全阀开启..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 油箱内部存在热膨胀** - While thermal expansion *is* causing continued leaking *after* the valve opened, it wasn't the *reason* the valve opened in the first place.
*   **C: 油箱已达到最大容量** - The passage doesn't mention the tank being at capacity.
*   **D: 二级防泄漏围护区不能容纳足够的桶** - The secondary containment area isn't full *yet*, so it's not the cause of the valve opening.



"
目前，第九区的水位有多高？,"The correct answer is **C: 已达齐腰深度**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""由于附近的防洪堤已经被淹没，目前水位已达齐腰深度。"" (Due to the nearby levees being submerged, the current water level is waist-deep.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 20 英尺 (20 feet)** - This was the peak water level *during* Hurricane Katrina, not the current level.
* **B: 6 英寸 (6 inches)** - This is the amount of rain that could breach the damaged levees, not the current water level.
* **D: 100 英尺 (100 feet)** - This is the width of the river segment, not the water level.



"
“卡特里娜”飓风期间，第九区发生了什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 洪水水位高达 20 英尺 (floodwaters reached as high as 20 feet)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""“卡特里娜”飓风来袭时，第九区洪水水位一度高达 20 英尺"" (During Hurricane Katrina, floodwaters in the Ninth Ward reached as high as 20 feet at one point).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 洪水宽度达 100 英尺 (flood was 100 feet wide):** While the passage mentions a 100-foot *section* of the river, it doesn't state the flood itself was 100 feet wide across the entire Ninth Ward.
* **B: 齐腰深水淹没了防洪堤 (waist-deep water flooded the levees):**  The passage says the *water level* is currently waist-deep, and the *levees were breached/overtopped*, not flooded themselves.
* **D: 6 英寸的降雨冲垮了损坏的堤坝 (6 inches of rain collapsed the damaged levees):** The passage states 6 inches of rain *could* collapse them, but doesn't say it *did* during Katrina.



"
以下哪项不是汉密尔顿确认的？,"The correct answer is **B: Other patients contracting the virus.**

Here's why:

* **P states:** The hospital *prevented* others from contracting the virus by isolating the patient. It doesn't confirm that other patients *have* contracted the virus, or even that there's a risk of that happening currently.
* **P states:**
    * **A: Patient's travel history:** ""这名患者曾去过尼日利亚"" (This patient has been to Nigeria)
    * **C: Following protocols:** ""医院遵循了感染控制规定"" (The hospital followed infection control regulations)
    * **D: Patient's condition:** ""汉密尔顿确认，霍华德大学医院收治的病人情况稳定"" (Hamilton confirmed the patient at Howard University Hospital is stable).

Therefore, the only thing Hamilton *didn't* confirm is the possibility of other patients becoming infected."
科学家想要弄清楚什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 地球是如何形成的 (How Earth was formed)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""科学家希望了解自从彗星很久以前与地球相撞以来，行星是如何形成的，尤其是地球的形成方式。"" This directly translates to ""Scientists hope to understand how planets were formed since comets collided with Earth a long time ago, *especially how Earth was formed*.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 彗星何时与地球相撞 (When comets collided with Earth)** - While the passage mentions a collision, the main focus isn't *when* it happened, but what resulted from it.
*   **B: 蛋白质是如何形成的 (How proteins are formed)** - Proteins are mentioned as a *result* of organic matter, but understanding protein formation isn't the scientists' primary goal.
*   **C: 有机物是什么 (What organic matter is)** -  Organic matter is explained, but the question is about what the scientists *want to find out*.



"
根据这段文字，当地警察在关闭行动中扮演了什么角色？,"The correct answer is **C: They instructed drivers to take alternate routes.**

Here's why:

* The text states ""80 police officers were on scene assisting with directing drivers around the closure."" This directly means they were guiding traffic to find other ways to go.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: They urged the FBI to close it.** - The text says the *FBI urged* the Maryland Transportation Authority, not the other way around.
* **B: They decided to close it.** - The Maryland Transportation Authority made the decision, at the FBI's urging.
* **D: They reported traffic delays along the alternate routes.** - The text specifically states there were *no significant delays* on the alternate route.



"
关闭期间隧道入口发生了什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 被封锁了**.

Here's why:

* The passage states ""自卸卡车用来封锁隧道入口"" (Dump trucks were used to block the tunnel entrances). This directly answers the question of what happened at the tunnel entrance during the closure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 被用于绕行** - The tunnel was *blocked* to necessitate rerouting, not used *for* rerouting.
* **C: 对驾车者开放** - The passage clearly states the tunnel was *closed*.
* **D: 导致交通堵塞** - The passage specifically states there were *no serious traffic delays* on the alternate route.



"
根据这段文字，在摄影师被车辆撞倒之前没有发生什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 公路巡警命令摄影师回到马路对面**

Here's why:

The text states: ""据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。 据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。 据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。 据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。 据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。 据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。 据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。 据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。 据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。 据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。 据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。 据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。 据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。 据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。 据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。 据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。 据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。 据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。 据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。 据警方称，撞倒摄影师的汽车司机未必会面临刑事指控。据警方称"
在被车撞前，这位摄影师试图做什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 拍摄警察的拦截**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""The photographer parked on the other side of Sepulveda Boulevard and began photographing the police stop, and continued to take photos after crossing the street..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 在 Sepulveda 大道上停车 (Parking on Sepulveda Boulevard)** - He *did* park there, but that wasn't his primary attempt *before* being hit. It was the starting point for his attempt to photograph the event.
*   **C: 穿过繁忙的公路 (Crossing the busy highway)** - He *did* cross the street, but this was *while* trying to photograph, not the initial attempt.
*   **D: 说服警察让他继续拍摄 (Persuading the police to let him continue shooting)** - The text says the police told him to go back to the other side, not that he was trying to persuade them.



"
下面哪项陈述没有准确描述总统检测结果呈阳性后的状况？,"The correct answer is **A: He feels unwell**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Besides a fever and sore throat, I feel fine and in good spirits..."" and ""his condition is stable."" This directly contradicts the statement that he feels unwell.

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurate:

* **B: He has a sore throat:** The text explicitly states, ""Besides a fever and sore throat...""
* **C: He is in stable condition:** The text directly says, ""...but his condition is stable.""
* **D: He has a fever:** The text explicitly states, ""Besides a fever and sore throat...""



"
根据这段文字，关于总统下面哪项陈述是正确的？,"The correct answer is **C: He is in good spirits and able to work remotely.**

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Besides a fever and sore throat, I feel well, am in good condition, and am continuing my work remotely."" This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He does not have a fever** - The text specifically says he *has* a fever.
*   **B: He will be at home for weeks** - The text says he will isolate for *days*, not weeks.
*   **D: He has a severe viral infection** - The text states he has a *mild* viral infection.



"
根据这段文字，热带气旋风暴古努预计何时会不断减弱？,"The correct answer is **B: 当风速下降到每小时 83 公里左右**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""到今天早些时候，风速为每小时 83 公里左右，预计会不断减弱。"" (To earlier today, the wind speed was around 83 kilometers per hour, and is expected to continue to weaken.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 在到达马尔代夫之前** - The text doesn't mention anything about the Maldives as a timeframe for weakening.
*   **C: 在达到最高峰之前** - The text says it *already* reached its peak and is now weakening.
*   **D: 在到达每小时 149 英里的风速之前** - The text says it *already* reached 149 mph (240 kmh) and is now weaker than that.



"
热带气旋风暴古努的最高峰时风速有多快？,"The correct answer is **C: 每小时 149 英里**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""热带气旋风暴古努（...）在最高峰时风速可达每小时 240 千米（每小时 149 英里）.""
* This directly answers the question of how fast the wind speeds were at their peak, giving the speed in miles per hour.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 每小时 149 公里** - While 149 km/h *is* mentioned, the question asks for the speed in miles per hour.
* **B: 每小时 240 英里** -  The passage gives 240 *kilometers* per hour, not miles.
* **D: 每小时 83 公里** - This is the *current* wind speed, not the peak speed.



"
下面哪个不被认为是腰鞭毛藻的特征？,"The correct answer is **C: It is multicellular**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""腰鞭毛藻是一种自然产生的*单细胞*海洋生物"" (Karekinomoe algae is a naturally occurring *single-celled* marine organism). This directly contradicts option C.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: It is an algae** - The passage clearly states it *is* an algae.
* **B: It can disrupt human nerves** - The passage says the algae produces a neurotoxin that *can* disrupt human and fish nerves.
* **D: It is naturally occurring** - The passage states it's a ""naturally produced"" organism.



"
腰鞭毛藻无法做到以下哪件事？,"The correct answer is **B: 在任何情况下数量急剧增加**.

Here's why:

The passage states that waist whip algae (腰鞭毛藻) increases *when natural factors combine to create ideal conditions*. This means their growth isn't automatic or guaranteed; it requires specific circumstances.  The passage doesn't say they *can't* increase rapidly, but it does say they don't do so without certain conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 破坏鱼类的神经 (Damage fish nerves)** - The passage explicitly states the algae produce a neurotoxin that damages fish nerves.
*   **C: 影响水质 (Affect water quality)** - Red tides *are* a visible change in water quality caused by the algae bloom.
*   **D: 产生神经毒素 (Produce neurotoxins)** - The passage states this directly.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不是飓风费利西亚的结果？,"The correct answer is **D: 街道洪水 (Street flooding)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""截至目前，还没有损坏或洪水的相关报告"" (Currently, there are no reports of damage or flooding).

Let's look at why the other options are results of Felicia:

* **A: 有益的降雨 (Beneficial rain):** The text specifically calls the rainfall on Oahu ""beneficial.""
* **B: 伴随雷暴的降雨 (Rain accompanied by thunderstorms):** The text states ""Some rainfall was accompanied by thunderstorms...""
* **C: 反复出现的闪电 (Frequent lightning):**  The text mentions ""frequent lightning"" alongside the thunderstorms.

Therefore, street flooding is the only option *not* mentioned as a result of Hurricane Felicia.



"
关于飓风费利西亚的哪项陈述是错误的？,"The correct answer is **B: It initially classified as a tropical depression then became a Category 4 storm.**

Here's why:

The passage states that Felicia *was* a Category 4 hurricane and then *weakened* to a tropical depression. This means it started as a strong hurricane and diminished, not the other way around.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Rainfall benefited Oahu:** The passage specifically calls the rainfall on Oahu ""beneficial.""
*   **C: Most islands experienced rain:** The passage says the remnants of the storm ""brought showers to most islands.""
*   **D: Some rain came with lightning:** The passage mentions ""some rainfall with thunderstorms and frequent lightning.""



"
以下哪项准确反映了 2009 年匈牙利大奖赛的结果？,"The correct answer is **C: 小皮奎特赛后被解雇 (Nelsinho Piquet was fired after the race)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""小皮奎特在 2009 年匈牙利大奖赛之后被解雇 (Nelsinho Piquet was fired after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 费尔南多·阿隆索卷入事故 (Fernando Alonso was involved in an accident):** The passage mentions Alonso's actions *leading* to events, not being *in* an accident at the Hungarian Grand Prix.
*   **B: 小皮奎特获得胜利 (Nelsinho Piquet won):** The passage doesn't state Piquet won the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.
*   **D: 安全车卷入事故 (The safety car was involved in an accident):** The passage mentions a safety car being deployed due to an accident, but not the safety car itself being *in* an accident.



"
事故发生在什么时候？,"The correct answer is **A: Inmediately after Alonso pitted**. 

Here's why:

The passage states ""费尔南多·阿隆索提前进站后，小皮奎特发生撞车..."" (After Fernando Alonso made an early pit stop, Piquet crashed...).  This directly links the crash to Alonso's pit stop.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: When other cars were refueling:** While refueling *happened* during the safety car period, it wasn't *when* the accident occurred. The crash triggered the safety car.
* **C: Before the safety car came out:** The safety car came out *because* of the crash.
* **D: After Piquet refueled:** The passage doesn't mention Piquet refueling.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项比研究人员最初预计的时间更短？,"The correct answer is **A: 物种的形成 (The formation of a species)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the new species evolved in just *two generations*, and that this is surprising because people believed the process would take *much longer*. This directly relates to the time it takes for a new species to form.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 关于物种的报道 (Reporting on the species):** The passage doesn't mention anything about how long it took to *report* on the species, only its formation.
* **C: 不同物种之间的繁殖 (Breeding between different species):**  The passage states the breeding *happened*, but doesn't imply it took less time than expected.
* **D: 物种的进化 (Evolution of species):** While species formation *is* a type of evolution, the specific point the passage makes is about the speed of *new species forming*, not evolution in general.



"
研究人员没有报告以下哪项内容？,"The correct answer is **C: 新物种的名称 (New species' name)**.

Here's why:

* **P** states the location (Galapagos Islands), the length of the evolutionary process (two generations), and the birds involved (Ground Finch and Cactus Finch).
* **P** *does not* mention the name of the new species.  It simply refers to it as ""a new bird species.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 新物种的形成地点 (New species' location)** - The passage clearly states the location is the Galapagos Islands.
* **B: 进化过程的长度 (Length of the evolutionary process)** - The passage states it took two generations.
* **D: 参与繁殖的鸟类 (Birds involved in the breeding)** - The passage identifies the Ground Finch and Cactus Finch.



"
奔牛节将在哪里举行？,"The correct answer is **B: 在布加勒斯特 (In Bucharest)**.

The passage specifically states: ""今年 6 月至 8 月，这座城市将成为东南欧第一个举办全球最大公共艺术活动奔牛节的城市。"" (This June to August, the city will become the first in Southeast Europe to host the world's largest public art event, the Running of the Bulls festival.)  And the previous sentence establishes the context is about Bucharest.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 在几个罗马尼亚城市 (In several Romanian cities)** - The text only mentions Bucharest.
* **C: 在整个东南欧 (Throughout Southeast Europe)** - While Bucharest is *in* Southeast Europe, the event is held *in* the city, not throughout the region.
* **D: 在几个欧洲首都城市 (In several European capital cities)** - The text specifies Bucharest is the *first* in Southeast Europe, implying it's not happening in multiple capitals.



"
以下哪项陈述准确描述了奔牛节？,"The correct answer is **D: 它是全球最大的公共艺术活动 (It is the world's largest public art event)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""...这座城市将成为东南欧第一个举办全球最大公共艺术活动奔牛节的城市 (the city will be the first in Southeast Europe to host the world's largest public art event, Running of the Bulls).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage states Bucharest is *becoming* a creative city, but doesn't say the festival *only* happens in creative cities.
* **B:** The festival isn't *founded* by the Bucharest City Hall, but rather *hosted* by Bucharest as part of a larger campaign initiated by the City Hall.
* **C:** The festival takes place specifically from June to August, not throughout the entire Southeast European summer.



"
是什么导致俄罗斯停飞了伊尔-76？,"The correct answer is **B: 一次事故**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""该事故后，俄罗斯短暂停飞了伊尔-76"" (After the accident, Russia briefly grounded the Il-76). The accident referred to is the one where an engine detached during takeoff on October 7th.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 内政部队 (Internal Troops):** While the plane was flown by internal troops, that's not the *reason* for the grounding.
*   **C: 苏联军队 (Soviet Army):** The Soviet Army is historical context, not the cause of the recent grounding.
*   **D: 一项待定调查 (A pending investigation):** The investigation is happening *because* of the accident, but the accident itself caused the grounding.



"
伊尔-76 是什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 飞机 (Airplane)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""伊尔-76 自 20 世纪 70 年代以来，一直是俄罗斯和苏联军队的主要组成部分"" and refers to engine failures on an ""飞机"" (airplane).  Therefore, Il-76 is a type of airplane.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 潜水艇 (Submarine)** - The passage discusses flying and engines, not underwater travel.
*   **B: 坦克 (Tank)** - Tanks don't have engines that detach during takeoff.
*   **D: 火车 (Train)** - Trains run on rails, not through the air."
谁雇佣了《辛普森一家》的编剧团队？,"The correct answer is **B: 西蒙**.

The passage states: ""他与布鲁克斯和格罗宁一起创作了《辛普森一家》，并负责聘请了该剧的首支编剧团队。"" (He co-created *The Simpsons* with Brooks and Groening, and was responsible for hiring the show's first team of writers.)

Therefore, Simon was the one who hired the writers."
根据福禄克的说法，谁发给她积极评价和鼓励？,"The correct answer is **D: 男女个人都有**.

The passage specifically states that ""many **men and women** individuals sent her positive feedback and encouragement.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 医生 (Doctors)** - The passage doesn't mention doctors specifically.
* **B: 女性健康活动家 (Women's health activists)** - While they *might* be among those sending feedback, the passage doesn't limit it to just activists.
* **C: 男性 (Men)** -  The passage mentions men *along with* women.



"
根据这段文字，有些人不希望女性发声的是关于什么的？,"The correct answer is **C: 女性健康 (Women's health)**.

The passage explicitly states that some people are trying to suppress women's voices *regarding women's health issues*. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 男性个人 (Male individuals):** While the passage mentions both men and women supporting Fluke, it doesn't say people are trying to silence voices *about* men.
* **B: 医疗费用 (Medical expenses):**  The passage mentions birth control being considered a medical *necessity*, but doesn't directly state the opposition is about cost.
* **D: 福禄克 (Fluke):** The passage says people are trying to suppress women's voices, not specifically Fluke herself.



"
根据这段文字，哪个星体最具活力？,"The correct answer is **A: 地球**.

The text states: ""斯托芬补充道：“据我们所知，只有一颗行星星体比土卫六表现得更有活力，那就是地球。”"" (Stofen added: ""As far as we know, only one planetary body is more active than Titan, and that is Earth."")

Therefore, Earth is identified as the most active planetary body.
"
一种由透明液体组成的河流和湖泊在哪个星体上被发现？,"The correct answer is **B: 土卫六 (Titan)**.

The passage explicitly states that the liquid, described as flowing like water and transparent, is found on Titan (""据我们所知，只有一颗行星星体比土卫六表现得更有活力，那就是地球。"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 木星 (Jupiter):** The passage doesn't mention anything about liquids on Jupiter.
*   **C: 太阳 (Sun):** The Sun is a star made of plasma, not a liquid.
*   **D: 土星 (Saturn):** While Titan orbits Saturn, the liquid is *on* Titan, not Saturn itself.



"
以下哪项发现不是由于羽毛发现而得出的？,"The correct answer is **D: 确认大多数恐龙有羽毛**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""这不仅证实了至少有些恐龙有羽毛——这一理论已经广为流传..."" (This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers - this theory was already widespread...) This means the idea that *some* dinosaurs had feathers was *already* known before this discovery. The discovery didn't *establish* that most dinosaurs had feathers, it supported the existing theory that *at least some* did.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, as they were discovered *because* of the feather find:

* **A: 动物的羽毛颜色 (Animal feather color):** The passage explicitly states the colors were determined: ""羽毛顶部为栗棕色，底部为浅色或胡萝卜色"" (the top of the feathers was chestnut brown, and the bottom was light or carrot colored).
* **B: 了解到羽毛不用于飞行 (Understanding that feathers were not used for flight):** The passage states: ""羽毛的结构表明它们不是用来飞行的，而是用来调节温度或炫耀的"" (The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight, but for temperature regulation or display).
* **C: 对羽毛进化的深入了解 (A deeper understanding of feather evolution):** The passage mentions: ""这一发现也有助于深入了解鸟类羽毛的进化"" (This discovery also helps to deepen understanding of bird feather evolution) and discusses the evolution of the rachis.



"
恐龙的羽毛缺少什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 羽轴**.

The passage explicitly states: ""恐龙的羽毛并没有发育良好的主干——这称为“羽轴”..."" which translates to ""The dinosaur's feathers did not have a well-developed central shaft - this is called a 'rachis'..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 羽小枝 (Feather barbules)** - The passage states dinosaurs *did* have barbules (""羽枝和羽小枝"").
*   **C: 成年羽毛 (Adult feathers)** - The passage states the sample *was* adult feathers, not juvenile down.
*   **D: 浅色底部 (Light-colored bottom)** - The passage states the feathers *had* a light-colored bottom.



"
以下哪项关于 ZMapp 的陈述是错误的？,"The correct answer is **B: 它能够治疗现有的感染，但无法预防死亡 (It can treat existing infections, but cannot prevent death)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""迄今为止，还没明确证明任何药物适合治疗现有的感染"" (So far, no drug has been clearly proven to treat existing infections). This directly contradicts option B's claim that ZMapp *can* treat existing infections.
* **The passage also states:** ""...正式研究表明，它在预防死亡方面的效果有些不尽人意"" (Formal studies have shown its effect on preventing death is somewhat disappointing). This means it *didn't* effectively prevent death.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: 它由抗体制成 (It is made of antibodies)** - The passage describes ZMapp as an ""抗体鸡尾酒"" (antibody cocktail).
* **C: 它在 PALM 实验中用作参照 (It was used as a reference in the PALM trial)** - The passage explicitly states, ""ZMapp 用作参照"" (ZMapp was used as a reference).
* **D: 研究表明，它的好处比最初预想的要少 (Studies have shown its benefits are less than initially thought)** - The passage states ""它的效果有些不尽人意"" (its effect is somewhat disappointing).



"
以下哪项陈述准确描述了 PALM 实验？,"The correct answer is **C: ZMapp was used as the baseline for the experiment.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ZMapp was used as a reference...that is, scientists used it as a baseline against which to compare three other treatments.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: These studies show it may be more beneficial than previously thought:** The passage says ZMapp's effectiveness was ""somewhat disappointing,"" not more beneficial.
* **B: The reference drug was compared to three other treatments, one of which was ZMapp:**  While ZMapp *was* a reference drug compared to others, it wasn't *one of* the treatments being compared *to* - it *was* the standard others were compared *against*.
* **D: It has been proven effective in treating existing conditions:** The passage states the opposite – no drugs have definitively proven effective for existing infections.



"
研究人员认为新型芯片对于哪里最重要？,"The correct answer is **A: 低收入国家**.

The passage explicitly states the chip can help patients in low-income countries with early detection of diseases, and highlights the disparity in survival rates between these countries and wealthier ones. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 富裕国家:** The passage states survival rates are *higher* in rich countries, making the chip less critical for them.
* **C: 美国:** While the research was done at Stanford in the US, the primary benefit is for other countries.
* **D: 斯坦福大学:** The location of the research doesn't define where the chip is most important for use.



"
将使用什么方法来构建诊断工具？,"The correct answer is **B: 标准喷墨打印机 (Standard inkjet printer)**.

The passage states: ""这种芯片可以使用标准喷墨打印机制造 (This chip can be manufactured using a standard inkjet printer).""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 每片一美分 (One cent per chip):** This is the *cost* of the chip, not the *method* of building it.
* **C: 可打印芯片 (Printable chip):** This describes *what* is being built, not *how* it's built.
* **D: 其他诊断工具 (Other diagnostic tools):** The question asks about *this* specific diagnostic tool.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪个关于瓣状裂谷的说法是不正确的？,"The correct answer is **D: 在月球表面上并没有发现太多这样的地貌 (In the lunar surface, not many such landforms have been found)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""These steep slopes are seen all over the Moon..."" This directly contradicts option D, which claims they aren't found in abundance.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: 形成它们的事件可能是近期发生的 (The events that formed them may have happened recently):** The text says they ""show that the geologic event that created these slopes happened relatively recently"" because they are not weathered.
* **B: 它们的存在意味着月球不缺少地质活动 (Their existence means the Moon is not lacking in geological activity):** The text explicitly states the theory ""contradicts the idea that there has been no geologic activity on the Moon.""
* **C: 它们可能是月球收缩的结果 (They may be the result of the Moon shrinking):** The passage states the landforms are ""clearly caused by the Moon shrinking.""



"
根据这段文字，以下哪种关于地貌的理论表明月球上正在发生地质活动？,"The correct answer is **A: 月球正在缓慢收缩**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""瓣状裂谷...是由于月球非常缓慢地收缩造成的。"" (These lobate scarps...are clearly caused by the Moon shrinking very slowly.) This directly links the landforms to ongoing (though slow) geological activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 这些地貌是很久以前形成的 (These landforms formed a long time ago):** The passage *contradicts* this, stating the lack of weathering indicates recent formation.
* **C: 月球表面只有极少量这样的地貌 (There are very few of these landforms on the Moon's surface):** The passage says they are ""随处可见"" (seen everywhere), the opposite of being rare.
* **D: 这些地貌是近期形成的 (These landforms are recently formed):** While true according to the passage, this is a *result* of the geological activity (the shrinking), not the theory *explaining* the activity itself. Option A is the underlying cause.



"
根据这段文字，在起诉之前，以下哪些内容不会再出现？,"The correct answer is **A: 进一步言论**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""起诉的主要负责部门皇家检控署向记者表示，至少在提起公诉之前将不会再发表进一步言论。"" (The main prosecuting authority, the Crown Office, told journalists that it would not be making any further comment, at least until a prosecution is raised.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 照片发布** - The text discusses concerns *about* photo publication and how it's different in Scotland, implying photos *have* been released and the concern is continuing release.
* **C: 关于目击者证据的讨论** - The text states witness evidence *could* be negatively affected, suggesting discussion about it is still possible.
* **D: 文章发布** - The text *is* an article being published, and doesn't indicate a stop to all article publication.



"
根据这段文字，对于猎海豹船来说，以下哪个不是当前的问题？,"The correct answer is **D: 冰的融化 (Ice melting)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the problems are:**
    * 极端的天气状况 (Extreme weather conditions)
    * 积冰数量 (Amount of ice accumulation)
    * 积冰的厚度 (Thickness of the ice accumulation)

* **The passage doesn't mention ice *melting* as a problem.** It focuses on the *accumulation* of ice as a major obstacle.

Therefore, ice melting is the only option that is *not* presented as a current issue in the text."
除了冰之外，还有什么因素影响了救援工作？,"The correct answer is **B: 天气条件 (Weather conditions)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""不只是碎冰，极端的天气状况也让救援工作困难重重"" (Not just broken ice, extreme weather conditions also make rescue work difficult) and ""皮特曼认为天气情况要到下周才能改善"" (Pittman believes the weather conditions will improve next week). 

The other options are not mentioned as hindering the rescue effort in the provided text.
"
罗伯茨没有证实哪种信念？,"The correct answer is **C: 生命的开始 (The beginning of life)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""罗伯茨断然拒绝谈论生命从何时开始的问题 (Roberts firmly refused to discuss the question of when life begins).""  This means he did *not* confirm a belief on this matter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 讨论案件的道德性 (Discussing the morality of cases):** While he avoided details, the passage says he thought commenting on case details was unethical – this *is* a belief he confirmed.
* **B: 最高法院作出一致性裁决的重要性 (The importance of a unanimous Supreme Court ruling):** He *emphasized* this importance.
* **D: 隐私权 (The right to privacy):** He *confirmed* he supports an implied right to privacy.

Therefore, the only belief Roberts didn't confirm was regarding the beginning of life.



"
罗伯茨觉得哪个话题过于不道德而不予评论？,"The correct answer is **D: 具体案例的细节**.

The passage states: ""他（罗伯茨）断然拒绝谈论生命从何时开始的问题。他说，评论可能发生的案件细节是不道德的。"" This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 最高法院裁决的一致性** - Roberts *emphasized* the importance of consistent rulings, he didn't find it unethical to discuss.
*   **B: 罗伊诉韦德案判决** - He *reaffirmed* his previous statements about Roe v. Wade.
*   **C: 默示隐私权** - He *confirmed* he supported it.



"
两束光照向哪里？,"The correct answer is **A: 照向天空**.

The passage states ""两束光被临时造出，彻夜指向天空"" (Two beams of light were temporarily created, pointing to the sky all night). This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 横穿城市 (Across the city)** - The passage doesn't say the lights spanned the city.
* **C: 在第一架飞机的目标处 (At the target of the first plane)** - While the time relates to the first plane hitting its target, the passage *specifically* states the lights point *up* to the sky.
* **D: 在纪念公园中央 (In the center of the memorial park)** - The passage mentions a memorial park, but doesn't say the lights are focused there.



"
根据这段文字，什么时候该地点正在建造新摩天大楼？,"The correct answer is **D: 施工正在进行中**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""该地点正在建设五座新摩天大楼..."" (The location is currently constructing five new skyscrapers...)  This directly indicates ongoing construction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 在一天当中 (During the day):** While construction *could* happen during the day, the text doesn't specify *when* the construction is taking place, only that it *is* taking place.
* **B: 上午 8 点 46 分 (8:46 AM):** This is the time of the plane impact, not when construction is happening.
* **C: 在夜间 (At night):** The text mentions lights being pointed into the sky *at night*, but doesn't link that to the construction.



"
哪些信息表明“七姊妹”是洞穴？,"The correct answer is **A: 温度变化 (Temperature changes)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states that the temperature variations – cooler during the day and warmer at night – are a key indicator that these features are likely caves.** This is based on how they compare to the surface and how they are similar to deeper underground openings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 洞穴入口的直径 (Cave entrance diameter)**: While the diameter is mentioned, it *describes* the features, it doesn’t *indicate* they are caves. Many things can have large openings.
* **C: 地质调查 (Geological survey)**: The USGS is doing the investigation, but the survey itself isn’t the evidence, it's the *findings* of the survey (like the temperature data) that are the evidence.
* **D: 地球上洞穴的照片 (Photos of caves on Earth)**: The passage uses Earth caves for *comparison* – to explain *why* the temperature behavior is significant – but the photos themselves aren’t the evidence for these particular features being caves.



"
如何观察“七姊妹”的热行为？,"The correct answer is **A: 红外图像**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""红外图像显示，昼夜温度的变化表示这些地方很可能是洞穴."" (Infrared images show temperature variations day and night indicating these are likely caves.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 地下深穴 (Underground deep holes):** While the passage *compares* the thermal behavior of the ""Seven Sisters"" to deep holes, it doesn't say this is *how* they are observed.
* **C: 洞穴的直径 (Cave diameter):** The diameter is a *characteristic* of the caves, not how their thermal behavior is observed.
* **D: 地球上的洞穴调查 (Cave investigations on Earth):**  The passage uses Earth caves for *comparison* to show the difference in thermal stability, but it's not how the ""Seven Sisters"" are observed.



"
根据这段文字，关于嫌疑人的哪项陈述不正确？,"The correct answer is **D: He was not injured.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""涉嫌引爆炸弹的男子在爆炸中受伤，随后被拘留。"" (The man suspected of detonating the bomb was injured in the explosion and then detained.) This directly contradicts option D.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: He used a vehicle in the attack:** ""据说该男子驾驶一辆装有炸药的三轮车驶进了人群当中。"" (It is said that the man drove a tricycle loaded with explosives into the crowd.)
* **B: He was accused of detonating explosives:** ""涉嫌引爆炸弹的男子..."" (The man suspected of detonating the bomb...)
* **C: Authorities know his ethnicity:** ""当局仍然不知道他的名字，只知道他是维吾尔族人。"" (Authorities still don't know his name, but they do know he is Uyghur.)



"
当局确认了哪些关于袭击的信息？,"The correct answer is **B: 嫌疑人的族裔 (The suspect's ethnicity)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""当局仍然不知道他的名字，只知道他是维吾尔族人。"" (Authorities still do not know his name, only that he is Uyghur.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 任何同谋者的身份 (The identities of any accomplices)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about accomplices.
* **C: 袭击背后的动机 (The motive behind the attack)** - The passage doesn't mention any motive.
* **D: 嫌疑人的名字和姓氏 (The suspect's name and surname)** - The passage specifically says authorities *don't* know the suspect's name.



"
哪些队伍将参加埃利斯公园的比赛？,"The correct answer is **C: 南非队和澳大利亚队**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""The final match of the series will be held next week at Ellis Park in Johannesburg, where the Springboks will play against Australia.""  ""Springboks"" is the nickname for the South African national rugby team.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 全黑队和澳大利亚队** - The All Blacks already played their final match.
*   **B: 新西兰队和南非队** - The All Blacks already played their final match.
*   **D: 斯普林博克斯和全黑队** - The All Blacks already played their final match."
斯普林博克斯将在哪里进行下一场比赛？,"The correct answer is **C: 约翰内斯堡**.

The text states: ""The final match of the series will be held next week at Ellis Park in Johannesburg, where the Springboks will face Australia.""
"
在任务中，空间站遇到了哪些困难？,"The correct answer is **B: 保持陀螺仪 (Maintaining gyroscopes)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""尽管早些时候在空间站任务中丢失了一个陀螺仪 (Despite earlier losing a gyroscope during a space station mission)..."" This directly identifies the gyroscope loss as a difficulty encountered during the mission.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 和推进器保持适当距离 (Maintaining proper distance from the thrusters):** The passage states Chiao and Sharipov were *at a safe distance* from the thrusters - this isn't a difficulty, it's a positive condition.
* **C: 启动飞机 (Launching the aircraft):**  Launching the aircraft was a *solution* to the problem, not the problem itself. The Russian ground control center *started* the aircraft to fix the issue.
* **D: 恢复正常姿态 (Restoring normal attitude):** Similar to C, restoring normal attitude was the *result* of actions taken to overcome a difficulty, not the difficulty itself.



"
根据这段文字，空间站的任务目标是什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 完成太空行走 (Complete the spacewalk)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the station maintained its attitude *until the spacewalk was completed*.** This implies the spacewalk was a primary goal, and everything was managed to allow it to finish.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 寻找丢失的陀螺仪 (Find the lost gyroscope):** While the loss of the gyroscope is *mentioned*, the passage doesn't say finding it was a task. It focuses on maintaining stability *despite* its loss.
* **B: 更靠近调姿推进器 (Get closer to the attitude control thrusters):** The passage explicitly states Chiao and Sharipov were at a *safe distance* from the thrusters. Getting closer isn't the goal.
* **D: 启动飞机 (Launch a plane):** The Russian ground control center launching ""a plane"" is a *solution* to a problem, not a task the station itself was trying to achieve. (It's also likely a mistranslation - it's probably referring to activating thrusters/boosters).



"
关于此案件的哪项陈述不正确？,"The correct answer is **D: 美国在线被起诉 (AOL was being prosecuted)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states AOL *initiated* the charges**, meaning they were the company bringing the lawsuit, not the one being accused. The passage says they are the ""leading internet service provider...that brought the charges.""

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: 该案件在美国在线总部所在的州起诉 (The case was prosecuted in the state where AOL's headquarters are located)** - The passage explicitly states this.
* **B: 已做出定罪 (A conviction was made)** - The passage says it was the ""first conviction under a 2003 law...""
* **C: 垃圾邮件相关法律被用于此案件 (Anti-spam laws were used in this case)** - The passage clarifies the law targets ""bulk unsolicited email (aka spam).""



"
哪项陈述准确描述了此案件？,"The correct answer is **D: 美国在线发起了此案件的起诉** (AOL initiated the lawsuit).

Here's why:

* The passage states ""作为发起指控的公司，领先的互联网服务提供商美国在线 (AOL)..."" which directly translates to ""As the company initiating the charges, leading internet service provider America Online (AOL)..."".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage states AOL *was* the company *bringing* the charges, not that they were accused of sending emails.
* **B:** The passage only mentions AOL as a party, and doesn't indicate another leading internet service provider was involved in the case.
* **C:** The case was *tried* under a law passed in 2003, but it doesn't say the lawsuit was filed in 2003.



"
根据这段文字，比达尔在三个赛季前开始为哪个俱乐部踢球？,"The correct answer is **A: 塞维利亚**.

The passage states that three seasons ago, Vidal **from Sevilla** joined Barcelona. This means he was playing for Sevilla *before* joining Barcelona.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 加泰罗尼亚** - 加泰罗尼亚 is a region, not a club.
*   **C: 巴萨** - The passage says he *joined* Barcelona three seasons ago, not that he started playing for them then.
*   **D: 首府** - 首府 (capital city) is just a descriptor of Barcelona; it's not a club.



"
比达尔为巴萨踢了多少场比赛？,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The passage explicitly states: ""自从转会到加泰罗尼亚的首府球队，维达尔已经为俱乐部踢了 49 场比赛。"" (Since transferring to the capital club of Catalonia, Vidal has already played 49 games for the club.)
"
在比赛中，对手是哪支球队？,"The correct answer is **B: 博洛尼亚 (Bolonia)**.

The passage states ""在周日与博洛尼亚队 (Bolonia) 对阵之前..."" which directly identifies Bologna as the opponent in the match. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 贾克 (Jarque):** Jarque is a player, not the opposing team.
*   **C: 科维尔恰诺 (Coverciano):** Coverciano is a location where the team is training.
*   **D: 意大利 (Italy):** Italy is the country, not the opposing team.



"
贾克为什么住在酒店里？,"The correct answer is **C: He has a game on Sunday.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He was staying at the team’s hotel preparing for Sunday’s match against Bologna."" This directly explains why Jarque is at the hotel - to prepare for the game against Bologna on Sunday.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He has practice** - While he *had* a training session earlier, the passage focuses on him being at the hotel *preparing* for the game, not currently practicing.
*   **B: He has a preseason meeting** - The passage doesn’t mention any meetings.
*   **D: He is training with Bologna** - He's playing *against* Bologna, not training with them.



"
为什么雅加达地质局不会发布预警？,"The correct answer is **D: It did not meet the earthquake's magnitude requirement.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""due to the fact that this earthquake did not reach magnitude 6.5, a tsunami warning will not be issued."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: There is no tsunami threat:** While true *as a result* of the magnitude, this isn't the *reason* the warning wasn't issued. It's the outcome.
*   **B: To avoid panicking residents:** The passage states residents *are* already anxious and leaving, so avoiding panic wasn't the reason for not issuing a warning.
*   **C: To avoid impacting local businesses:** The passage mentions businesses are closing, indicating the earthquake *is* having an impact regardless of a warning. This isn't a reason for the bureau's decision.



"
根据这段文字，地震造成了什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 当地居民坐立不安 (Local residents are uneasy)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""尽管那里没有海啸的威胁，当地居民却感到坐立不安，纷纷结束生意及离开家园。"" (Despite the lack of a tsunami threat, local residents are uneasy, ending their businesses and leaving their homes.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 海啸威胁 (Tsunami threat):** The passage *explicitly* states there is *no* tsunami threat.
* **C: 预警发布 (Warning issued):** The passage states *no* tsunami warning has been issued.
* **D: 6.5 级地震 (6.5 magnitude earthquake):** The passage mentions 6.5 as the threshold *not* reached, but doesn't say the earthquake *was* 6.5 magnitude. It just says it was *less than* 6.5.



"
以下哪个因素驱动太阳和其他所有恒星的活动？,"The correct answer is **C: 自转和光度 (Self-rotation and luminosity)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""他们发现，太阳和其他恒星的运行原理是一样的：星系中所有恒星的活跃度都完全决定于它们的光度和自转 (They discovered that the sun and other stars operate on the same principles: the activity of all stars in galaxies is completely determined by their luminosity and rotation).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 光度和等离子体流 (Luminosity and plasma flow):** While plasma flow *relates* to the Rossby number, the passage states luminosity and *rotation* are the determining factors, not plasma flow directly.
* **B: 罗斯贝数、自转和磁场倒转 (Rossby number, self-rotation, and magnetic field reversal):**  The Rossby number is *determined by* luminosity and rotation, and relates to magnetic field reversal. It's not a *driver* itself, but a consequence of the drivers.
* **D: 光度、罗斯贝数和自转 (Luminosity, Rossby number and self-rotation):** Again, the Rossby number is a result of luminosity and rotation.



"
恒星的罗斯贝数是如何确定的？,"The correct answer is **A: 光度和自转 (Luminosity and rotation)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""一颗恒星的罗斯贝数由其光度和旋度共同决定"" (A star's Rossby number is jointly determined by its luminosity and rotation).  ""旋度"" is related to rotation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 等离子体流的数量 (Number of plasma flows)** - The passage mentions plasma flows *are related to* the Rossby number, but doesn't say they *determine* it.
* **C: 活跃度 (Activity)** - The Rossby number *determines* activity, not the other way around.
* **D: 磁场倒转的数量 (Number of magnetic field reversals)** - The Rossby number affects how frequently magnetic fields reverse, but doesn't *constitute* the number of reversals itself.



"
有多少受访者支持澳大利亚立即成为共和国？,"The correct answer is **B: 29%**.

The text states: ""29% of respondents believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible...""

Therefore, 29% of the respondents supported Australia becoming a republic immediately."
根据朱莉娅·吉拉德的说法，澳大利亚应该在什么时候成为共和国？,"The correct answer is **B: 在伊丽莎白二世女王退位后**

The text states: ""看守总理朱莉娅·吉拉德在2010年联邦大选竞选期间称，她认为在女王伊丽莎白二世退位后，澳大利亚应该成为共和国。"" (which translates to: ""Incumbent Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II abdicates."")
"
哪个组织正在接受法律调查？,"The correct answer is **C: 计划生育计划 (Planned Parenthood)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the Komen Foundation's new policy caused Planned Parenthood's funding to be put on hold *because* of the investigation into Planned Parenthood's funding practices led by Cliff Stearns. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 众议院能源和商业委员会 (House Energy and Commerce Committee)** - This committee is *conducting* the investigation, not *under* investigation.
*   **B: 科曼基金会 (Komen Foundation)** - The Komen Foundation *responded to* the investigation by changing its funding policy, but isn't being investigated itself.
*   **D: 监督和调查小组委员会 (Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee)** - This is a part of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and is also conducting the investigation, not being investigated.



"
克利夫·斯特恩斯是哪个委员会的负责人？,"The correct answer is **D: 监督和调查小组委员会**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""As chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee under the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Stearns is currently investigating...""

While Stearns *is* part of the House Energy and Commerce Committee (A), he specifically leads the *subcommittee* focused on oversight and investigations. The other options (B and C) are organizations, not committees Stearns leads.



"
根据这段文字，瑞士妇女没有发生什么事情？,"The correct answer is **C: She was sexually assaulted by 5 people.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""we arrested 5 men for **raping** this Swiss woman..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Her stolen items were recovered:** While true, this is a *result* of the crime, not the crime itself. The question asks what happened *to* the woman.
* **B: She was murdered:** The text does not mention her being murdered.
* **D: Her phone and laptop were stolen:** This is also a *result* of the crime, not the core event that happened to her.



"
哪家公司获得了 2007 年台湾永续发展奖？,"The correct answer is **C: 华硕**.

The passage explicitly states: ""但在华硕获得台湾行政院颁发的 2007 年台湾永续发展奖后..."" (But after Asus received the 2007 Taiwan Sustainable Development Award awarded by the Taiwan Executive Yuan...)
"
华硕 Eee PC 是什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 笔记本电脑**.

The passage explicitly states: ""早先于全球发布的华硕 Eee PC 个人笔记本..."" which translates to ""Asus Eee PC personal **laptop** released earlier than globally..."". 

Therefore, the Eee PC is a laptop.
"
谁对丢失的邮政文件负责？,"The correct answer is **C: 一个男孩 (a boy)**.

The passage states that the missing postal items were discovered after finding a boy hiding over 600 postal documents, including the undelivered New Year's cards. Therefore, the boy is responsible for the missing files.



"
根据这段文字，谁为丢失的文件道歉？,"The correct answer is **D: 奥巴那泽邮局 (Obanazawa Post Office)**.

The text states: ""yesterday, the post office apologized to citizens and the media..."" 

Therefore, the Obanazawa Post Office is the one who apologized for the missing mail.



"
德尔·波特罗何时需要解决他的肩膀问题？,"The correct answer is **C: 在第二盘比赛期间**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""此时波特罗接受了肩膀治疗，但仍坚持继续比赛"" which directly translates to ""At this point, Del Potro received treatment for his shoulder, but continued to play.""  This happened *after* the score reached 6-6 in the second set, meaning it occurred *during* the second set.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 在第一盘比赛期间** - The text doesn't mention any shoulder issues during the first set.
*   **B: 在第一次抢七局之前** -  The treatment happened *after* the first tiebreak, when the second set was tied 6-6.
*   **D: 在第三次抢七局之后** - There's no mention of a third tiebreak in the passage.



"
第一次抢七局的结果是什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 穆雷在第一盘输了** (Murray lost the first set).

The passage specifically states: ""穆雷在抢七局中输掉了第一盘"" (Murray lost the first set in the tie-break). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 德尔·波特罗在受伤后输了** (Del Potro lost after being injured) - The passage says Del Potro *received* treatment, but doesn't say he lost.
* **C: 穆雷在第二盘赢了** (Murray won the second set) - The passage says the second set went to a tie-break *after* being 6-6, but doesn't state the outcome of that tie-break.
* **D: 德尔·波特罗在第二盘赢了** (Del Potro won the second set) - Same reason as C; the outcome of the second set tie-break isn't given.



"
根据这段文字，谁具体接触了一位患者？,"The correct answer is **B: 儿童 (Children)**.

The text specifically states: “今天，我们得知一些学龄儿童已被确认曾与该患者有过接触。” (Today, we learned that some school-aged children have been confirmed to have had contact with the patient.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 州长 (Governor):** The text says the governor *reported* contact, but didn't have contact himself.
*   **C: 德克萨斯州官员 (Texas officials):** The text doesn't mention officials having contact.
*   **D: 当地公民 (Local citizens):** While the governor is assuring citizens, the text only specifically mentions children having contact.



"
根据这段文字，德克萨斯州州长在向德克萨斯州的公民发表讲话时，没有做出什么保证？,"The correct answer is **D: 这个病例不严重**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""州长还表示：‘这个病例很严重。’"" (The governor also said, ""This case is serious."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 系统运作良好 (System is functioning well):** The governor says, ""我们的医疗系统运作良好，请大家放心。""
* **B: 正在采取措施保护公众的安全 (Taking measures to protect public safety):** The first sentence states, ""他向德克萨斯州的公民保证，政府正在采取措施来保护公众的安全。""
* **C: 准备好设备应对挑战 (Prepared equipment to meet challenges):** The governor specifically says, ""世界上几乎没有其他设备更齐全的地方，能更好地应对这种情况下带来的挑战。""

Therefore, the only promise the governor *didn't* make was that the case wasn't serious – he explicitly said it *was* serious.
"
哪个戏说新闻来源是由两位前华盛顿大学学生创立的？,"The correct answer is **D: 《洋葱报》 (The Onion)**.

The passage explicitly states that Heck and Johnson conceived of the publication while at the University of Washington in 1988, and that publication is *The Onion*. The other options are mentioned as being *influenced* by The Onion, not as being the publication itself.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不包括在《洋葱报》讽刺戏仿类新闻帝国中？,"The correct answer is **B: 一部电影 (a movie)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions the following as part of *The Onion*'s empire:

*   **印刷刊物 (printed publications)**
*   **网站 (website)** - specifically mentioning 5 million unique visitors
*   **个人广告 (personal ads)**
*   **24 小时新闻网络 (24-hour news network)**
*   **播客 (podcasts)**
*   **世界地图集 (world atlas)** - ""Our Dumb World""

A movie is **not** listed in the passage. Therefore, it's the correct answer."
根据这段文字，警察当时在看守什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 唐宁街入口处**.

The text states: ""抗议活动于当地时间 11:00 (UTC+1) 左右在白厅 (Whitehall) 开始，白厅对面是首相官邸唐宁街的入口处，**由警察看守**。""

This directly states the police were guarding the entrance to Downing Street. The other options are locations the protesters *moved towards* or were related to the event the protesters were targeting, but not where the police were initially stationed to provide security."
警方在什么时间要求抗议者移动以避免进一步交通拥堵？,"The correct answer is **D: 在 11:20 时**.

The text states: ""11 点 20 分，警察要求抗议者退回到人行道，并告知抗议者，在行使抗议权利时，务必考虑到越来越拥堵的公共交通问题。""  This directly answers the question.



"
关于埃胡德·乌尔博士的研究，哪项陈述是正确的？,"The correct answer is **B: 一些先前患有糖尿病的老鼠不再患病** (Some mice that previously had diabetes are no longer sick).

Here's why:

* **The passage states directly:** ""他补充道：“我们现在有 4 个月大没有糖尿病的老鼠，但它们曾经得过该病。”"" (He added, ""We now have mice that are 4 months old and do not have diabetes, but they used to have the disease."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 结果可能对已患有 1 型糖尿病的人有益** (The results may benefit people who already have type 1 diabetes) - The passage specifically says the findings *don't* relate to people with type 1 diabetes.
* **C: 他对这些发现能带来治愈持乐观态度** (He is optimistic that these findings will lead to a cure) - The passage states he is *skeptical* about a cure.
* **D: 一些未患糖尿病的老鼠现在患有糖尿病** (Some mice that didn't have diabetes now do) - The passage doesn't mention this; it focuses on mice *recovering* from diabetes.



"
根据这段文字，埃胡德·乌尔博士对什么持怀疑态度？,"The correct answer is **B: 治愈是否可能**.

The text states: ""和与其他一些专家一样，他对糖尿病能否治愈持怀疑态度。"" (And like some other experts, he is skeptical about whether diabetes can be cured.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 这些发现是否与 1 型糖尿病患者相关** - The text *directly* states he points out the findings are *not* related to those with type 1 diabetes, but doesn't say he's skeptical about that connection. He's stating a fact.
* **C: 其他专家对治愈的意见** - While he agrees with other experts, his skepticism is about the *possibility of a cure itself*, not their opinions.
* **D: 未患糖尿病的老鼠是否会保持这种状态** - The text doesn't mention his skepticism about the mice staying diabetes-free.



"
以下哪项陈述未能准确地描述 CG4684 次航班的坠毁？,"The correct answer is **C: 飞机在坠毁前尝试着陆三次**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the plane attempted to land *twice*:** ""As Papua New Guinea Airlines flight CG4684, the ‘Twin Otter’ aircraft had already attempted to land at Kokoda Airport yesterday but had failed once. ... It disappeared about ten minutes before its second approach to land.""
* **A is accurate:** The text explicitly mentions ""恶劣天气"" (adverse weather) caused the initial landing failure.
* **B is accurate:** The passage describes the difficulty of access and the need for helicopter transport and hiking to reach the crash site, indicating a remote location.
* **D is accurate:** The text states ""恶劣天气"" (adverse weather) also hampered the search efforts.

Therefore, option C is the only statement that isn't supported by the information in the text."
是什么导致 CG4684 次航班放弃着陆？,"The correct answer is **D: 天气条件恶劣 (恶劣的天气条件)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""导致飞机着陆失败的恶劣天气，也使搜索工作受到了阻碍。"" (The adverse weather that caused the aircraft to fail to land also hampered the search effort.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 着陆地点不可抵达 (Landing site inaccessible):** The plane *attempted* to land, so the site wasn't entirely inaccessible, just difficult due to weather.
* **B: CG4684 前面还有几架飞机 (Several planes ahead of CG4684):**  The passage doesn't mention any other aircraft.
* **C: 飞机改道飞往科科达 (Aircraft diverted to Kokoda):** The plane didn't divert, it failed to land and then disappeared.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项关于弗朗齐歇克·科瓦尔的经历是真实的？,"The correct answer is **B: He ultimately was not injured.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""幸存者弗朗齐歇克·科瓦尔说..."" (Survivor Franzisek Kowal said...) This directly implies he *survived* and therefore wasn't injured.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He managed to break a window:** The text says *others* were trying to break the windows, and that *finally* a window broke, but doesn't say Kowal himself broke it.
* **C: He broke a chair while trying to escape:** The text states people *used* chairs to break the windows, not that Kowal broke a chair *trying* to escape.
* **D: He was injured while trying to break a window:** The text doesn't mention any injuries to Kowal.  It only states he is a survivor.



"
为什么很难评估热带风暴“丹妮尔”可能产生的影响？,"The correct answer is **C: 风暴远未登陆 (The storm is far from making landfall)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""鉴于风暴远未登陆，目前仍难以评估它对美国或加勒比地区的潜在影响。"" (Given the storm is still far from landfall, it is currently difficult to assess its potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 风暴预计会增强为大飓风 (The storm is expected to strengthen into a major hurricane):** While this is true, it doesn't explain *why* assessment is difficult *now*.  The potential for strengthening is a factor in future assessment, not the current difficulty.
* **B: 科学家不确定风暴的持续风速 (Scientists are unsure of the storm's sustained winds):** The passage *gives* the sustained wind speed, so this isn't the issue.
* **D: 风暴距离迈阿密太远 (The storm is too far from Miami):** Distance alone isn't the reason; it's the fact that it hasn't come closer to land yet.  A storm far away *can* still have impacts, but those impacts are harder to predict.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项关于热带风暴“丹妮尔”的陈述不正确？,"The correct answer is **D: It is about to make landfall.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""鉴于风暴远未登陆，目前仍难以评估它对美国或加勒比地区的潜在影响。"" (Given the storm is still far from land, it is currently difficult to assess its potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.)  This directly contradicts the idea that it's *about to* make landfall.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: The impact on the Caribbean is uncertain** - The passage states it's difficult to assess the potential impact on the Caribbean.
* **B: It formed in the Atlantic** - The passage states it formed in the eastern Atlantic.
* **C: It may turn into a hurricane** - The passage states scientists predict it will strengthen into a major hurricane.



"
根据这段文字，有人认为全球性疫情爆发前一定会发生什么？,"The correct answer is **A: It will become less lethal.**

Here's why:

The passage states, ""He specifically mentioned some studies showing that the disease must first reduce its own lethality before triggering a global pandemic."" This directly supports the idea that the virus needs to become less deadly *before* a pandemic can occur.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Symptoms will remain mild:** The passage discusses concern *because* symptoms might be mild (and therefore go unnoticed), not that they *will* remain mild.
*   **C: More people need to be infected:** While the passage mentions increased transmission, it doesn't say this is a *requirement* before a pandemic. It's a consequence of lower lethality.
*   **D: Children will develop symptoms:** The passage focuses on the fact that children haven't *developed* symptoms yet, and that's concerning. It doesn't state they *will* develop them.



"
根据这段文字，台风距离福建有多远？,"The correct answer is **C: 70 公里**.

The passage states: ""台风莫拉克的台风眼距离中国福建省约 70 公里。"" (Typhoon Morakot's eye is approximately 70 kilometers from China's Fujian Province.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 9 公里** - This number isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **B: 11 公里** - This is the *speed* of the typhoon, not the distance.
*   **D: 77 公里** - This number isn't mentioned in the text. It seems like an attempt to add the speed to the distance, but the question asks for the distance *currently*.



"
乔治·沃克·布什抵达亚洲后谁迎接了他？,"The correct answer is **C: 黄根成和李显龙**.

Here's why:

* The passage states he was welcomed by Singaporean Deputy Prime Minister **黄根成** (Wong Kan Seng) *and* discussed issues with Prime Minister **李显龙** (Lee Hsien Loong).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 总理 (Prime Minister)** - Only mentions Lee Hsien Loong, not the Deputy Prime Minister.
* **B: 观众 (Audience)** - He *addressed* an audience, but they didn't *welcome* him.
* **D: 副总理 (Deputy Prime Minister)** - Only mentions Wong Kan Seng, not the Prime Minister.



"
总统何时谈到亚洲的贸易扩张？,"The correct answer is **C: 在中期选举失利后**.

The text specifically states: ""布什向听众讲述了亚洲贸易扩张的形势。 在经过一周的中期选举失利后..."" (Bush spoke about the state of Asian trade expansion *after* his week of midterm election losses.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 抵达新加坡时** - He was *welcomed* upon arrival, but didn't discuss trade expansion then.
*   **B: 与黄根成在一起时** - He discussed trade and terrorism with Lee Hsien Loong, not Huang Kuncheng.
*   **D: 在他为期一周的亚洲之行中** - This is too broad. The text pinpoints *when* he discussed it – after the election losses."
根据这段文字，政府的总体目标是什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 缓解车厢过度拥挤的情况 (Alleviate the overcrowding situation of carriages)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the addition of carriages is ""to alleviate overcrowding.""  This is the stated *purpose* of the funding and expansion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 今年 3 月前，为额外车厢提供资金援助 (Provide funding for additional carriages before March of this year):** This is a *previous* commitment, not the ultimate goal. The passage says the announcement *continues* a promise made in March.
* **B: 总共获得 300 节车厢 (Obtain a total of 300 carriages):**  300 carriages are being *added*, not the total goal.
* **C: 新增 1300 节车厢 (Add 1300 carriages):** The passage states the *total* will be 1300, not that 1300 are being added.



"
政府宣布了什么？,"The correct answer is **A: They plan to fund an additional 300 carriages**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""为额外车厢提供资金援助。新增 300 节车厢"" (funds for additional carriages. adding 300 carriages). This directly answers the question of what the government announced.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: They are committed to alleviating carriage problems:** While true, this is a broader statement of intent, not the specific announcement.
* **C: They plan to fund an additional 1300 carriages:** The passage states the *total* will be 1300, not that they are funding that many *additional* carriages.
* **D: Overcrowding problems will be resolved before March:** The passage mentions March as the date of the *original* commitment, not a deadline for resolving the problem.



"
根据这段文字，已知什么信息？,"The correct answer is **A: 威胁等级已降低 (Threat level has been lowered)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""然而，把威胁等级降到严重级别..."" (However, lowering the threat level to serious...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 不再有任何威胁 (There are no more threats)** - The passage *specifically* says the opposite: ""...并不意味着整体威胁已经消失 (does not mean the overall threat has disappeared).""
* **C: 预计会发生袭击 (An attack is expected)** - The passage says ""没有情报表明近期会有袭击发生 (There is no intelligence indicating an attack will occur soon).""  This means no attacks are *expected* based on current intelligence.
* **D: 情报已确认袭击将是严重的 (Intelligence has confirmed the attack will be serious)** - The passage states the opposite – there's no intelligence about an attack.



"
以下哪项关于抗议的陈述是不正确的？,"The correct answer is **C: 抗议要求前任 CEP 辞职**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""上个月，总统委员会建议前任 CEP 辞职..."" (Last month, the Presidential Commission *recommended* the former CEP resign...).  It does *not* say the protests themselves demanded the resignation. The Presidential Commission acted *in response* to the protests and suggested the resignation as part of a solution.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: 总统委员会是对抗议的回应 (The Presidential Commission was a response to the protests):**  ""该委员会是马尔泰利 (Martelly) 对始于 10 月份的大规模反政府抗议活动做出的回应.""
* **B: 延误的选举引发了抗议 (Delayed elections triggered the protests):** ""自 2011 年以来，由于一些选举未能如期举行而引发了这些抗议活动...""
* **D: 抗议有时是暴力的 (Protests sometimes turned violent):** ""...有时抗议还会升级为暴力事件.""



"
谁建议最后一任 CEP 辞职？,"The correct answer is **C: 总统委员会 (Presidential Commission)**.

The text states: ""上个月，总统委员会建议前任 CEP 辞职 (Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP)..."" 

Therefore, the Presidential Commission suggested the previous CEP resign."
根据声明，美国体操协会在纳萨尔对运动员性侵之后没有支持什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 吊销执照 (Revoking licenses)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""不如在我们组织内部继续推进有意义的变革，可能更有利于维护运动员和俱乐部的利益及其运动"" and ""与其吊销执照，不如在我们组织内部继续推进有意义的变革"".  This directly implies that the US Gymnastics Association *did not* support revoking licenses as a first step. They preferred internal changes and investigation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 创造一个充满支持的环境 (Creating a supportive environment)** - The passage explicitly states they support this: ""...让运动员在安全、积极和充满支持的环境中追求他们的梦想.""
*   **C: 组织内必要的变革 (Necessary changes within the organization)** - The passage actively *supports* this: ""...推进有意义的变革...""
*   **D: 独立调查 (Independent investigation)** - The passage states they support an independent investigation: ""根据美国体操协会支持的一项独立调查...""



"
根据声明，美国体操协会和美国奥委会的主要目标是什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 为运动员营造安全的环境** (To create a safe environment for athletes).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""美国体操协会和美国奥委会有一个共同的目标，那就是尽可能保证体操运动和其他运动的安全性，让运动员在安全、积极和充满支持的环境中追求他们的梦想。"" (USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic & Paralympic Committee share a common goal of ensuring the safety of gymnastics and all sports as much as possible, allowing athletes to pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and supportive environment.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 揭露拉里·纳萨尔的性侵行为** (Revealing Larry Nassar's sexual abuse) - While the passage *mentions* Nassar's abuse, it's framed as something already exposed (""幸存者勇敢曝光的"") and the investigation aims to understand *why* it wasn't detected, not to re-reveal it.
*   **B: 寻求吊销执照** (Seeking revocation of licenses) - The passage states USA Gymnastics *prefers* internal reform *over* license revocation.
*   **C: 寻求私人调查** (Seeking a private investigation) - The passage mentions supporting an *independent* investigation, but this is a means to an end (safety), not the primary goal itself.



"
当事件发生时，这艘船正在前往哪个目的地？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 巴拉望**.

The text explicitly states the ship was ""on its way to Princess Port in Palawan"" (普林塞萨港的巴拉望)."
关于文中提到的船只，哪项陈述中的事实不是真的？,"The correct answer is **B: 它的基地在巴拉望 (Its base is in Palawan)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the ship is *en route to* Princessa Port in Palawan, but does not say its base is *in* Palawan.** It explicitly states the ship is *deployed from* Sasebo, Nagasaki, Japan.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

* **A: 它正在前往普林塞萨港的途中 (It is en route to Princessa Port)** - Directly stated in the passage.
* **C: 它是一艘反水雷舰 (It is a mine countermeasure ship)** - The passage calls it a ""revenge-class mine countermeasure ship.""
* **D: 它属于美国海军第七舰队 (It belongs to the US 7th Fleet)** - The passage explicitly states it belongs to the US 7th Fleet.



"
谁发表了关于美军的声明？,"The correct answer is **A: 唐纳德·特朗普 (Donald Trump)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""周日晚些时候，美国总统唐纳德·特朗普通过新闻秘书发表声明..."" (On Sunday evening, US President Donald Trump issued a statement through his press secretary...).  While the statement *was delivered* by the press secretary, it was *issued by* and *from* Donald Trump.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 塔伊普·埃尔多安 (Recep Tayyip Erdoğan):** He *received* a call from Trump, but didn't make the statement about the troop withdrawal.
* **C: 伊斯兰国武装分子 (ISIS militants):** They are the subject of the statement, not the source.
* **D: 新闻秘书 (Press Secretary):** The press secretary *delivered* the statement, but didn't *make* it.



"
根据声明，哪个国家承担了看守被捕武装分子的责任？,"The correct answer is **D: 土耳其**. 

The text states: ""该声明称，土耳其还将接管对被捕的伊斯兰国武装分子的看守任务..."" (The statement said that Turkey would also take over custody of captured Islamic State militants...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 叙利亚** - The text says the US is *leaving* Syria, not taking on custody.
*   **B: 欧洲** - The text states European countries *refused* to take them back.
*   **C: 美国** - The text states the US is *withdrawing* and handing custody over.



"
什么被认为是这次坠机的原因？,"The correct answer is **B: 敌方火力 (Enemy fire)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""坠机发生在高海拔山区，**据称是敌方火力所致**."" (The crash occurred in a high-altitude mountainous area, **reportedly due to enemy fire**.)

While the passage mentions bad weather and mountainous terrain as challenges *during the search*, it specifically attributes the *cause* of the crash to enemy fire.
"
坠机发生在什么类型的地形上？,"The correct answer is **D: 山区的 (Mountainous)**.

The passage specifically states: ""坠机发生在高海拔山区"" which translates to ""The crash occurred in high-altitude mountainous areas.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 敌方的 (Enemy)** - While enemy fire *caused* the crash, it doesn't describe the *terrain*.
*   **B: 恶劣的 (Adverse/Severe)** - The weather was adverse, but the question asks about the *terrain*.
*   **C: 联军的 (Coalition)** - The coalition forces were *operating* in the area, but the terrain wasn't ""coalition"" terrain.



"
官员们希望洪水会带来什么结果？,"The correct answer is **A: 沙洲的恢复 (Sandbar restoration)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...but officials hope this will be enough to restore the eroded sandbars downstream.""  This directly links the officials' hope to the recovery of sandbars.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 海滩的形成 (Beach formation):** While sandbars contribute to beaches, the passage specifically focuses on the sandbars themselves.
* **C: 弓背鲑数量的增长 (Increase in bowfin salmon numbers):** The passage mentions the bowfin salmon are *endangered*, not that officials expect the flood to immediately increase their numbers.
* **D: 更多野生动物的栖息地 (More wildlife habitat):**  While sandbar restoration *could* lead to more habitat, the passage directly states the hope is for the sandbars to be restored, not the habitat itself.



"
大坝建成对以下哪项造成了永久性影响？,"The correct answer is **D: 沉积物扩散 (Sediment dispersal)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""沉积物不再冲散到河流里 (Sediment no longer washes down the river)."" This is a *direct* and *permanent* consequence of the dam's construction. The dam physically prevents the sediment from flowing downstream.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: 沙洲 (Sandbars):** While the *formation* of sandbars is affected, the passage suggests attempts to *restore* them.  So the impact isn't necessarily permanent.
* **B: 弓背鲑 (Bowback salmon):** The salmon are *endangered* as a *result* of the change, but the dam's primary impact is on the sediment.  The salmon's fate is a consequence, not the direct permanent change.
* **C: 野生动物栖息地 (Wildlife habitat):** This is also a consequence of the sediment issue. The habitat is impacted *because* of the lack of sandbars and beaches.

**Therefore, the most fundamental and lasting change caused by the dam is the disruption of sediment dispersal.**"
根据这段文字，谁向美国提供了有关可能的袭击的情报？,"The correct answer is **C: 一名不愿公开身份的人士**.

The text explicitly states: “美国表示，他们收到了来自一名不愿公开身份的人士提供的信息...” 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 索马里极端分子** - The text says the extremists are *planning* attacks, not providing intelligence *about* planned attacks.
* **B: 埃塞俄比亚大使馆** - The text doesn't mention any information coming from the Ethiopian embassy.
* **D: 肯尼亚的一个消息来源** - While the attacks are planned for Kenya, the source of the information was not specifically Kenyan according to the text.



"
以下哪项陈述准确描述了极端分子所谓的袭击计划？,"The correct answer is **C: 在两个国家的地标处引爆炸弹** (In landmarks in two countries).

Here's why:

* The passage states the threat is for attacks in **both Kenya and Ethiopia**.
* It specifically mentions targeting ""**famous landmarks**"" in both countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 在一个国家的地标处引爆炸弹** (In a landmark in one country) - Incorrect because the threat covers two countries.
* **B: 在两个国家引爆炸弹** (Bombings in two countries) - Incorrect because it doesn't specify *where* in those countries (landmarks).
* **D: 在一个国家引爆炸弹** (Bombings in one country) - Incorrect because the threat covers two countries.



"
以下哪位不是律师？,"The correct answer is **A: 彼得罗斯·曼图瓦洛斯**.

Here's why:

* **萨基斯·科查吉欧格鲁 (Sakis Kechagioglou)** is explicitly stated to be a lawyer.
* **乔治·尼可拉考普洛斯 (George Nikolakopoulos)** is explicitly stated to be a lawyer.
* **马基斯·特里安塔菲洛普洛斯 (Makis Triantafyllopoulos)** is stated to be an ""议员兼律师"" (member of parliament *and* a lawyer).
* **彼得罗斯·曼图瓦洛斯 (Petros Mantouvalos)** was removed from office due to allegations involving his *office members* taking bribes, but the text doesn't state he himself is a lawyer. He was likely a high-ranking official (given he was ""removed from office""), but not necessarily a legal professional.

"
以下哪个人群没有被提到是希腊法律界丑闻的一部分？,"The correct answer is **C: 记者**.

Here's why:

* **法务官 (A):** The passage explicitly states ""法官、律师、法务官和检察官前几年的非法勾当曝光于世"" (judges, lawyers, bailiffs and prosecutors' illegal dealings over the past few years have been exposed).
* **法官 (B):** The passage mentions ""最高法官埃万杰洛斯·卡卢西斯因腐败和堕落行为被判入狱"" (Supreme Court Judge Evangelos Kaloussis was sentenced to prison for corruption and depravity).
* **检察官 (D):**  As mentioned above, the passage directly includes ""检察官"" (prosecutors) in the group involved in illegal dealings.
* **记者 (C):** While a journalist (马基斯·特里安塔菲洛普洛斯) *reported* on the scandal, the passage doesn't state journalists were *part* of the corruption itself. They are observers/reporters, not implicated individuals.

Therefore, journalists are the only group not directly implicated in the scandal as described in the text.



"
印度输掉几个三柱门？,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The passage explicitly states: ""But after the captain lost three wickets, India ended the innings having lost **7 wickets**."" 

The other options are incorrect:
* **A: 11** - This number refers to the number of fours Robin Uthappa hit.
* **C: 2** - This number refers to the number of sixes Robin Uthappa hit.
* **D: 36** - This number refers to the score India had at the end of the innings."
根据这段文字，这一局中最高得分是多少？,"The correct answer is **A: 70 分**.

The text specifically states: ""罗宾·乌萨帕 (Robin Uthappa) 取得了本局的最高分，...赢得 70 分."" (Robin Uthappa scored the highest in this inning, scoring 70 runs).

While 100 runs were scored as a partnership and 36 was the final score, 70 is the *highest individual score* within the inning.
"
以下哪项不是亚当·库尔登感到不满的原因？,"The correct answer is **A: 网站有关性内容的新政策**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Adam Cuerden is upset because Wells lied about the *reasons* for removing content (initially claiming legal issues, then deleting artwork despite seeming to listen to concerns). It also mentions public outrage *leading to* a new policy regarding sexual content, but doesn't say Cuerden is directly unhappy with the policy itself.

Let's look at why the other options *are* reasons for his dissatisfaction:

* **B: 威尔斯删除艺术作品 (Wells deleting artwork):**  The passage explicitly says ""he directly deleted these artworks.""
* **C: 威尔斯不听他的话 (Wells not listening to him):**  The passage states Wells ""first pretended to listen to our opinion, then directly deleted the artworks.""
* **D: 有关删除艺术作品原因的谎言 (Lies about the reason for deleting artwork):** The passage directly quotes Cuerden saying ""He [Wells] lied to us from the start.""



"
根据这段文字，网站上删除了什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 艺术作品**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""...he [Wales] simply deleted these artworks."" It directly links the dissatisfaction expressed by Adam Cuerden to the removal of ""artworks.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 性内容:** While the text mentions public outcry *about* sexual content and a policy being drafted *regarding* it, it doesn't say sexual content was *deleted*.
* **C: 政策草案:** The text says a policy is being *drafted*, not deleted.
* **D: 私人拥有的媒体:** The text states the site has ""millions of media with public broadcast licenses,"" meaning it's not privately owned media that was deleted.



"
根据这段文字，阿米尔·可汗不支持以下哪项？,"The correct answer is **A: 让女性选手参加奥运会 (Letting female athletes participate in the Olympics)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""in his heart he believes women should not compete."" This directly indicates he doesn't support female athletes competing.
* **He *does* support British athletes:** He says he will support British athletes at the 2012 Olympics.
* **The text doesn't mention his support/opposition to female *opinions*:** The focus is solely on their participation in competition.
* **He doesn't oppose London hosting the Olympics:** He explicitly states he'll support athletes at the London Olympics.

Therefore, the only thing he clearly doesn't support, according to the text, is women competing in the Olympics.



"
根据这段文字，尽管阿米尔·可汗有个人观点，但他会支持以下哪项？,"The correct answer is **C: 2012 年奥运会 (2012 Olympic Games)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Despite his views, he said he would support British athletes at the 2012 London Olympics."" This means he will support the 2012 Olympic Games, even though he personally doesn't believe women *should* compete.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 女性选手 (Female athletes)** - He specifically said he doesn't believe women *should* compete, so he doesn't support them in principle.
*   **B: 他在 2004 年奥运会的同组参赛者 (His fellow competitors in the 2004 Olympics)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about his feelings towards them.
*   **D: 其他银牌得主 (Other silver medalists)** -  The passage doesn't mention anything about other silver medalists.



"
彼得·伦茨是在什么时候去世的？,"The correct answer is **C: In the hospital**. 

Here's why:

* The passage states Peter Lenz was rushed to a local hospital *after* the initial accident and *later died* there. While the accident happened during warm-up (A) and involved falling and being struck (B), he didn't die *at those moments*.  The medical personnel tried to help (D) but ultimately couldn't save him at the hospital."
谁是泽维尔·扎亚特？,"The correct answer is **B: 另一名赛车手 (another racer)**.

The passage states: ""...Lenz was struck by another racer, Xavier Zayat, following behind."" This clearly identifies Zayat as a racer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 赛道医务人员 (track medical personnel):** The passage states medical personnel *attended to* Lenz, but doesn't say Zayat was one of them.
*   **C: 医生 (doctor):** Similar to A, the passage mentions medical personnel, not specifically a doctor being Zayat.
*   **D: 粉丝 (fan):** The passage specifically states Zayat was a racer on the track.



"
在哪种情况下，焦虑的乘客可能会受益于了解飞机的内部工作原理？,"The correct answer is **B: If their anxiety centers on a fear of the unknown.**

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""...to overcome the fear arising from the unknown or uncontrollable situations, understanding how airplanes work and the procedures of flying may be helpful.""  Option B directly reflects this idea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: If the passenger feels ashamed of their fear:** While the passage acknowledges fear isn't shameful, it doesn't suggest *understanding the mechanics* will help with *shame*. It's about addressing the fear itself.
* **C: If the passenger dislikes all types of transportation:** The passage focuses specifically on fear of flying, not a general dislike of transportation.
* **D: If their anxiety stems from a painful experience unrelated to flying:** The passage addresses fear related to the flight experience (unknown, uncontrollable). A separate painful experience would likely require different coping mechanisms.



"
根据这段文字，一个注重价格的旅客应该最后做以下哪一项？,"The correct answer is **D: 查看航空公司的网站**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...同时看看航空公司自己的网站，是有好处的。"" ( ""...it is beneficial to also check the airline's own website."")

The passage highlights the importance of comparing prices *and then* checking the airline's website itself. This implies checking the airline's website is a final step in the process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 搜索多个旅游公司的产品 (Search products from multiple travel companies)** - The passage says to compare prices *from* these companies, not just search their products.
* **B: 直接向航空公司订票 (Book directly with the airline)** - The passage explicitly states people rarely do this *without* first searching and comparing.
* **C: 比较多个旅游公司的价格 (Compare prices from multiple travel companies)** - This is a step *before* checking the airline's website, not the final step.



"
根据这段文字，为了获得最佳的航班价格，旅客应该首先做什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 比较不同信息汇集网站上的价格**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""有时，同一航班在不同信息汇集网站上的价格可能相差很大，在预订前先比较搜索结果...是有好处的。"" (Sometimes, the price of the same flight can vary greatly on different information aggregation websites, it is beneficial to compare search results before booking...)

While the passage also suggests checking the airline's website, it frames this *after* comparing prices on aggregator sites.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 查看航空公司的网站** - The text says to check this *along with* aggregator sites, not first.
*   **C: 直接通过航空公司订票** - The text actually says people rarely do this anymore *without* searching first.
*   **D: 直接向旅行社订票** - The passage doesn't mention travel agencies at all.



"
在配送时，何时需要陪同人员？,"The correct answer is **C: 当物品被作为托运行李发送时**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""根据航空公司规定，禁止载运未登机旅客的行李，而这时就需要你在场。"" (According to airline regulations, baggage for non-traveling passengers is prohibited, and this is when you need to be present.) This directly links the need for someone to accompany the shipment to when it's sent as checked baggage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 当物品通过航空货运发送时** - The passage states air freight *can* be slow due to unloading and customs.
* **B: 当公司使用自己的飞机时** - The passage says large companies *have* their own planes, but doesn't mention needing accompaniment in this scenario.
* **D: 当配送由大型公司处理时** - The passage doesn't connect accompaniment to the size of the delivery company.



"
根据这段文字，在选择一个联盟中的“飞行常客”航空公司时，应该优先考虑以下哪项？,"The correct answer is **A: 提供最多积分的航空公司**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that you shouldn't automatically join the program of the airline you fly most often. Instead, it advises considering which airline *within the alliance* will reward you with the *most* frequent flyer points. This directly points to prioritizing the airline offering the most benefits (in this case, points).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 最大联盟中的航空公司 (The largest alliance's airline):** The text focuses on choosing *within* an alliance, not choosing the largest alliance itself.
* **C: 你最常选择的航空公司 (The airline you most often choose):** The passage specifically warns *against* this approach.
* **D: 可能添加额外权益的航空公司 (An airline that might add extra benefits):** While extra benefits are good, the passage focuses on the benefit of *points* as a key factor.



"
根据这段文字，谁可能会提供更多的飞行常客积分？,"The correct answer is **D: 同一联盟内的不同航空公司**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...同一联盟下的其他航空公司可能会回馈更多常旅客积分。"" This directly translates to ""other airlines within the same alliance may reward more frequent flyer points.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 不同联盟中的不同航空公司 (Different airlines in different alliances)** - The passage focuses on airlines *within* the same alliance, not across different alliances.
*   **B: 同一联盟中你最经常选择的航空公司 (The airline you most frequently choose within the same alliance)** - The passage *advises against* automatically choosing based on frequency, suggesting others within the alliance might be better.
*   **C: 不同联盟中你最经常选择的航空公司 (The airline you most frequently choose in different alliances)** - Again, the focus is on airlines *within* a single alliance.



"
根据这段文字，哪种感觉会受过量饮酒的损害？,"The correct answer is **B: 视觉**.

The passage states that overconsumption of alcohol can lead to ""even blindness and death."" This directly links excessive drinking to damage to vision.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 听觉 (Hearing)** - The text doesn't mention any impact on hearing.
*   **C: 味觉 (Taste)** - The text doesn't mention any impact on taste.
*   **D: 嗅觉 (Smell)** - The text doesn't mention any impact on smell.



"
根据这段文字，哪种措施可能会减轻饮酒的有害影响？,"The correct answer is **C: 适量饮酒 (Moderate alcohol consumption)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""适量饮用含酒精的饮料 (Moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages)...了解自己的饮酒极限非常重要 (Understanding your own limits is very important)."" This directly supports the idea that moderation can help mitigate harm.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 饮用含甲醇的酒类 (Drinking alcohol containing methanol):** The passage warns that methanol is *dangerous* and can cause blindness or death.
* **B: 饮用非法生产的烈酒 (Drinking illegally produced spirits):** The passage specifically states these are *more dangerous* due to harmful impurities.
* **D: 与不同的人一起喝酒 (Drinking with different people):** This has no bearing on the harmful effects of alcohol; it doesn't make drinking safer.



"
阿姆斯特丹的哪个区的房产价值最高？,"The correct answer is **A: 运河区**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""该区的房产价值位居该国的最高之列"" (the property values in this area are among the highest in the country) referring to the ""运河区 (Grachtengordel).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 任何一个被联合国教科文组织列为世界遗产的地方 (Any place listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site):** While being a UNESCO site is *related* to the value, the passage specifically highlights the *运河区* as having the highest values, not all UNESCO sites.
* **C: 从宾嫩斯塔移除的区域 (Areas removed from Binnenstad):** This is irrelevant to the information provided.
* **D: 具有历史价值的地点 (Places with historical value):**  Historical value is a *reason* for the high value, but doesn't pinpoint the specific area with the highest property values.



"
为什么运河区被联合国教科文组织列为世界遗产？,"The correct answer is **A: 它的历史和文化价值 (Its historical and cultural value)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""由于独特的文化和历史价值，整个地区被联合国教科文组织列为世界遗产"" (Because of its unique cultural and historical value, the entire area was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 它的独特属性 (Its unique properties)** - While true, the passage *specifies* historical and cultural value as the reason.
* **C: 它的宾嫩斯塔周围的位置 (Its location around Binnenstad)** -  Location is a *description* of the area, not the reason for UNESCO designation.
* **D: 它的高房产价值 (Its high property value)** - Property value is a result of its desirability, not a reason for being a World Heritage site.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪一项使得格罗姆寺值得一去？,"The correct answer is **A: 可俯瞰洞里萨湖的景色 (The view of Tonle Sap Lake)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""寺庙阴郁的氛围和洞里萨湖（Tonle Sap）的景色，让人感到爬到山顶是值得的。"" (The temple's gloomy atmosphere and the view of Tonle Sap Lake make the climb to the top worthwhile.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 通过吴哥门票旅行 (Traveling with an Angkor pass)** - While needing a pass is mentioned, it doesn't *make* the temple worthwhile, it's just a requirement for entry.
* **C: 参观暹粒 (Visiting Siem Reap)** - The temple is *near* Siem Reap, but visiting the city itself isn't the reason the temple is worthwhile.
* **D: 乘船游湖 (Taking a boat trip on the lake)** - Boat trips are a *separate* activity you can do *in addition* to visiting the temple, not a reason to visit the temple itself.



"
根据这段文字，游客进入格罗姆寺需要什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 获取吴哥门票** (Get an Angkor Pass).

The text explicitly states: ""需要购买吴哥门票才能进入圣殿"" which translates to ""You need to purchase an Angkor Pass to enter the temple.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 攀登经过耶输跋摩寺庙** (Climbing through Yeasuvarman Temple) - While the temple *was* built by Yeasuvarman, the text doesn't state you need to climb *through* his temple, only that it was built during his reign.
*   **B: 游览暹粒** (Visiting Siem Reap) - Siem Reap is where the temple is located, but you don't need to visit the city *to* enter the temple.
*   **D: 在洞里萨湖上划船** (Boating on Tonle Sap Lake) - Boating on the lake is a *possible* activity *in addition* to visiting the temple, but not a requirement for entry.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪种情况可能会阻止游客前往南极洲？,"The correct answer is **D: 身体活动能力有限 (Limited physical fitness)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""旅行费用高昂，对身体素质要求也很高"" (Travel costs are high, and physical fitness requirements are also high). This directly indicates that a lack of physical fitness could prevent someone from visiting Antarctica.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 旅行预算过多 (Too much travel budget):** The passage states travel is *expensive*, not that *too much* budget would prevent a visit.  Having a large budget would actually *enable* a visit.
* **B: 只对探索罗斯海感兴趣 (Only interested in exploring the Ross Sea):** The passage states Ross Sea is *one* of the areas tourists visit – being interested in it wouldn't prevent a visit.
* **C: 允许在十二月至次年一月旅行的工作安排 (Work schedule allowing travel from December to January):** The passage states travel is possible from November to February, so December/January falls *within* the travel window.



"
一个对登山感兴趣的旅游者可能会参观南极洲的哪个地区？,"The correct answer is **B: 内陆地区**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Occasionally, specialized air tour groups travel to the interior for climbing activities...""  This directly links the interior of Antarctica with climbing/mountaineering.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 罗斯海** - The passage mentions the Ross Sea as a general area for tourism, but doesn't specifically tie it to climbing.
* **C: 半岛** - The passage lists the peninsula as a main tourist location, but doesn't mention climbing there.
* **D: 群岛** - Similar to the peninsula, the islands are tourist destinations, but not linked to climbing.



"
哪里最不可能设有前现代的天文台？,"The correct answer is **C: 偏远地区**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that *modern* telescopes are located in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions. It also implies that *pre-modern* observatories were built in cities or on campuses *because* light pollution wasn't a problem then, making them more accessible. Therefore, a pre-modern observatory would be **least** likely to be in a remote area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 容易到达的地方** - The passage states pre-modern observatories were *easier to reach* than modern ones.
* **B: 城市中心** - The passage specifically mentions observatories being built *in cities*.
* **D: 大学校园** - The passage explicitly says observatories were often located *on campuses*.



"
现代科研望远镜可能会被安置在哪里？,"The correct answer is **D: 大型设施**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""大多数现代科研望远镜都是巨型设施，位于大气条件优良的偏远地区。"" (Most modern research telescopes are giant facilities located in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 博物馆 (Museums):** The passage says *old* observatories are now mostly museums.
* **B: 大学校园 (University Campuses):** The passage says old observatories were *often* on campuses, but modern ones are not.
* **C: 教育场所 (Educational Places):** Similar to B, this describes where *older* observatories were located, not modern ones.



"
根据这段文字，哪个地区最适合安静的沙滩日？,"The correct answer is **C: 北港区 (North Shore Beaches)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states North Shore beaches are ""almost all sandy"" and ""swimming is safe.""** It also mentions the shade of the Pohutukawa trees (New Zealand Christmas trees), suggesting a more natural and potentially less crowded environment.
* **Tamaki Drive beaches (Mission Bay and St Heliers) are described as ""often crowded with holidaying families"" and lined with shops.** This indicates they are busy and less likely to be quiet.
* **The question asks for a *quiet* beach day.**

Therefore, the North Shore beaches are the best fit based on the information provided.



"
根据这段文字，哪里的游泳条件可能是最安全的？,"The correct answer is **A: 德文波特 (Devonport)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""北岸海滩…从北部的长湾 (Long Bay) 一直延伸到南部的德文波特 (Devonport)。这里几乎都是沙滩，**游泳很安全**...""  and ""塔马基大道 (Tamaki Drive) 海滩…游泳很安全"".

While both areas are described as having safe swimming, Devonport is specifically mentioned as being *within* the area described as safe.  The question asks for *where* swimming is safest, and Devonport is a specific location within the safe swimming area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 北港区 (North Harbour):** This is too broad. The safe beaches are *within* North Harbour, but not the entire area.
*   **C: 奥克兰中部 (Auckland Central):** The text mentions beaches in the central area (Mission Bay, St Heliers), but doesn't specifically highlight them as *more* safe than the North Shore beaches.
*   **D: 长湾 (Long Bay):** Long Bay is mentioned as being part of the North Shore beaches, but Devonport is also mentioned and has the same safety attribute. Since Devonport is a single location, it is a more specific answer.



"
在文中描述的位置参观时，以下哪项行为被认为是不合适的？,"The correct answer is **B: 在某个地方留下标记** and **C: 开玩笑**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""不要在建筑物上做标记或涂鸦，以免破坏遗址."" and ""不要用大屠杀或纳粹开玩笑.""
* **A: 举止庄重** is *appropriate* – the text asks for ""尊严、庄严和尊重.""
* **D: 划伤建筑物** is also inappropriate as it damages the site, which the text warns against, but B and C are *directly* mentioned as unacceptable.

Therefore, leaving a mark or making jokes are specifically prohibited behaviors at this sensitive historical site."
以下哪项描述了通用语？,"The correct answer is **D: 逐步形成的**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""通用语是一种自然的或逐步形成的语言..."" (A lingua franca is a natural or *gradually developed* language...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 人工的 (Artificial):** The passage specifically contrasts auxiliary languages as *artificial* with lingua francas.
* **B: 不自然的 (Unnatural):** Lingua francas can be natural languages.
* **C: 构造的 (Constructed):** This describes auxiliary languages, not lingua francas.



"
哪项陈述不能准确地描述辅助语言？,"The correct answer is **D: 它们是不同语言使用者之间创造的占主导地位的语言**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that auxiliary languages are *different* from lingua francas (dominant languages used for communication between speakers of other languages).** Lingua francas *become* dominant, while auxiliary languages are *created* to aid communication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** This describes a *lingua franca* (a language that develops naturally for communication), not an auxiliary language which is *constructed*.  However, the passage does state auxiliary languages are *for* facilitating communication between those who don't understand each other.
* **B:** The passage states auxiliary languages are *constructed* languages. They aren't naturally occurring. While they can *use* elements from natural languages, the overall language is deliberately made.
* **C:** This accurately reflects the passage's description of the *purpose* of auxiliary languages.



Therefore, option D is the only statement that contradicts the information provided in the passage."
根据这段文字，如果乘客的航行是在冬天，应该检查什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 客舱位置 (Cabin location)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""If traveling across the Baltic Sea in winter, you should check the cabin location, as sailing on ice creates very frightening noises for those most affected."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 签证要求 (Visa requirements):** While the text mentions visa exemptions, it doesn't say you *should check* them specifically if traveling in winter. It just provides that information.
* **C: 条款 (Terms and conditions):** The text mentions ""service terms"" but doesn't suggest checking them as a priority during a winter voyage.
* **D: 城内观光活动时长 (Duration of city tours):** This is mentioned as part of the St. Petersburg cruise but isn't related to winter travel concerns.



"
根据这段文字，如果乘客的航行是在夏季，他们可能能够避免什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 穿越冰面 (crossing the ice)**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states the noise from traveling on ice is a concern during *winter* crossings of the Baltic Sea. 
* Therefore, a summer voyage would likely avoid this issue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 城内观光活动 (city sightseeing tours):** The passage states sightseeing is *included* in the St. Petersburg cruises, regardless of season.
* **C: 签证要求 (visa requirements):** The passage says passengers are *exempt* from visa requirements, not that it's avoided in summer.
* **D: 圣彼得堡 (St. Petersburg):** The cruise *goes to* St. Petersburg, it's not something to be avoided.



"
为什么加泰罗尼亚语在巴塞罗那的指示牌和广播中经常使用？,"The correct answer is **B: 它是该市的第一官方语言 (It is the city's first official language)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""然而，大多数指示牌都只使用加泰罗尼亚语，因为这是法律规定的第一官方语言。"" (However, most signs are only in Catalan because it is the legally established first official language.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 它比西班牙语更广为人知 (It is more widely known than Spanish)** - The passage states almost everyone understands Spanish, and about half prefer Catalan. This contradicts the claim that Catalan is *more* widely known.
* **C: 它是巴塞罗那的首选语言 (It is Barcelona's preferred language)** - While half *prefer* it, the passage doesn't state it's the overall preferred language for all communication.
* **D: 地铁和其他公共设施的使用者多为讲加泰罗尼亚语的市民 (Users of the metro and other public facilities are mostly Catalan speakers)** - The passage doesn't give information about the language of public transportation users. It *does* say systems provide information in multiple languages including Spanish, English etc.



"
以下哪种语言是巴塞罗那地铁系统用于定期广播的语言？,"The correct answer is **B: 加泰罗尼亚语**.

The passage states: ""地铁里的定期广播只有加泰罗尼亚语..."" (Metro regular announcements are only in Catalan...)
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项服务不太可能是高端民宿的重点？,"The correct answer is **D: 快速的 WiFi**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the *luxury* and *experience* offered by high-end B&Bs. It specifically mentions:

* **Luxurious bedding:** handmade quilts, antique beds.
* **Gourmet breakfasts:** local, seasonal foods, or specialty dishes made by the hosts.
* **Atmosphere:** Historic buildings, antique furniture, well-maintained grounds (including pools).

These all contribute to a sense of indulgence and a unique stay. While modern amenities are likely *available* in these places, the passage doesn't highlight them as a key competitive factor or part of the luxurious experience.  Fast WiFi is a functional convenience, not a luxury experience point emphasized in the text.

Let's look at why the other options *are* likely:

* **A: 特色菜 (Specialty dishes):** Directly mentioned as part of the breakfast offering.
* **B: 独特的古色古香的家具 (Unique antique furniture):**  Explicitly stated as a feature of the environment.
* **C: 精心维护的室外空间 (Well-maintained outdoor space):**  Mentioned with the example of a swimming pool, indicating attention to the grounds.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不是豪华民宿之间的主要竞争点？,"The correct answer is **A: Modern decoration**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that B&Bs compete on ""beds and breakfast"" and describes luxurious *bedding* (handmade quilts, antique beds) and *breakfast* (local, seasonal food, specialties). It also mentions the *setting* – historic buildings with antique furniture.

* **B: A series of seasonal breakfast choices** - explicitly mentioned as part of the competition.
* **C: High-end bedding** - explicitly mentioned as a key competitive area.
* **D: Locally sourced food and drink** - The passage references ""local, seasonal food.""

However, the passage focuses on *antique* furniture and *historic* buildings.  There's no mention of *modern* decoration being a competitive factor. In fact, the description leans heavily toward a traditional, historical aesthetic.

Therefore, **A: Modern decoration** is the answer that is *not* a competition point according to the passage.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不会在 2022 年的北京举行？,"The correct answer is **B: 太子城滑雪场比赛**.

Here's why:

The text states that other skiing events will be held in **Zhangjiakou, Prince City Ski Resort**, which is *about 220 kilometers (140 miles) from Beijing*.  Therefore, the Prince City Ski Resort competitions will **not** be held *in* Beijing.

The text explicitly states that the opening ceremony, closing ceremony, and indoor ice skating events *will* be held in Beijing.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项将在 2022 年的北京举办？,"The correct answer is **B: 室内滑冰赛事**.

Here's why:

* **The text specifically states:** ""北京将举办开幕式、闭幕式和室内滑冰赛事."" (Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies and indoor skating events.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 夏季奥运会** - The text says Beijing is the *first city to host both* summer and winter, but it doesn't say the summer games are happening in 2022.
* **C: 冬季奥运会** - While Beijing is *hosting* the Winter Olympics, the text doesn't say the entire event is *in* Beijing; some events are in Zhangjiakou.
* **D: 闭幕式** - While the closing ceremony *is* in Beijing, the question asks what will be *held* in Beijing, and indoor skating is a specific event.  The closing ceremony is a single event, not a category of events.



"
谁最容易感染禽流感？,"The correct answer is **C: 养禽场工人 (Poultry farm workers)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""大多数病例出自与家禽打交道的人群 (Most cases come from people who deal with poultry).""  养禽场工人 (poultry farm workers) are the people who *most* frequently deal with poultry.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **A: 观鸟者 (Bird watchers)** - The passage says they have *some* risk, but it's lower than those working directly with poultry.
* **B: 与哺乳动物打交道的人群 (People who deal with mammals)** - The passage states the flu can infect mammals, but focuses on bird-to-human transmission.
* **D: 曾经被感染过的人 (People who have been infected before)** - The passage doesn't mention reinfection or prior infection as a risk factor.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项陈述准确描述了禽流感？,"The correct answer is **C: 观鸟者有感染的风险 (Birdwatchers are at risk of infection)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""但观鸟者也有一定风险 (but birdwatchers are also at some risk).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 只有养禽场工人感染了禽流感 (Only poultry farm workers have contracted avian influenza)** - The passage states *most* cases are from people dealing with poultry, but it also says birdwatchers are at risk, meaning it's not exclusive to farm workers.
* **B: 在人类中报告的病例比在鸟类中更多 (More cases have been reported in humans than in birds)** - The passage states avian influenza infects birds *and* mammals, and implies it's far more common in birds, as it's named after them.  It also states there are fewer than 1000 human cases.
* **D: 在人类中报告的所有病例都是致命的 (All reported cases in humans have been fatal)** - The passage states *some* cases are fatal, not all.



"
白令海峡连接着什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 北冰洋和波罗的海**.

The passage states: ""白令海峡经由奥内加湖（Lake Onega）、拉多加湖（Lake Ladoga）和圣彼得堡（Saint Petersburg）连接北冰洋和波罗的海...""

Therefore, the Bering Strait connects the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea.
"
根据这段文字，为了不打扰乘客，护照可能在哪种交通工具上收取？,"The correct answer is **B: 夜间卧铺列车**.

The text specifically states: ""在夜间卧铺列车上，为了不影响乘客睡眠，列车长可能会提前收取护照。"" (On overnight sleeper trains, to avoid disturbing passengers' sleep, the train conductor may collect passports in advance.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 飞机 (Airplane)** - The text doesn't mention passport collection on airplanes.
* **C: 轮船 (Ship)** - The text doesn't mention passport collection on ships.
* **D: 跨境列车 (Cross-border train)** - While the text mentions needing identification for cross-border trains, it specifically states passport collection happens *to avoid disturbing sleep* on *night* trains.



"
根据这段文字，在某些跨境列车上，什么时候可能会检查你的身份证件？,"The correct answer is **D: 在行驶中的列车上 (In the moving train)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""一些跨境列车的查验在车上进行"" which translates to ""Some cross-border train checks are conducted *on* the train.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 下车后 (After getting off)** - The text mentions entry checkpoints being the first stop *after* disembarking, but doesn't say ID checks happen then specifically for trains.
* **B: 当你睡觉时 (When you are sleeping)** - While the text mentions passports being collected *to avoid disturbing sleep*, it doesn't say that's *when* the check happens, just that collection might occur beforehand.
* **C: 不会检查 (Will not be checked)** - The text clearly states that ID checks *do* happen on some cross-border trains.



"
在新加坡高热带地区居住最可能遇到的问题是什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 中暑 (Heatstroke)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""由于处在赤道以北几度的“高热带”，你将需要同时应对高温（终年）和强烈的阳光..."" (Because it's located a few degrees north of the equator in the ""high tropics"", you will need to cope with both high temperatures (year-round) and strong sunshine...).  This directly points to heat-related issues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 被抢劫 (Being robbed):** The passage states Singapore is ""very safe.""
* **B: 无法购物 (Inability to shop):** The passage states you can ""buy almost anything"" upon arrival.
* **D: 迷路 (Getting lost):** The passage states navigation is ""easy.""



"
谁可能想避免食用德国糕点？,"The correct answer is **A: 对坚果有严重过敏的人**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""许多德国烘焙食品也以杏仁、榛子和其他坚果为特色 (Many German baked goods also feature almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts).""  Someone with a severe nut allergy would need to avoid these foods.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 喜欢更丰富甜点的人 (People who like richer desserts):** The passage doesn't suggest German pastries *aren't* rich. It simply describes what they *are*.
* **C: 不喜欢巧克力的人 (People who don't like chocolate):** The passage doesn't mention chocolate at all.
* **D: 相比咸味更喜欢甜味的人 (People who prefer sweet over savory):** The passage clearly describes sweet pastries, so this group would likely *enjoy* them.



"
德国糕点中哪种配料被认为是季节性的？,"The correct answer is **C: 李子 (Plums)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""水果点心很常见，苹果全年都能用来做点心，**夏天还能吃到樱桃和李子**。"" This indicates that cherries and plums are specifically available and used in pastries during the summer season.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 苹果 (Apples):** The text says apples are available ""全年"" (all year round).
*   **B: 榛子 (Hazelnuts):** The text states hazelnuts are a common feature in many German baked goods, but doesn't mention seasonality.
*   **D: 杏仁 (Almonds):** Similar to hazelnuts, almonds are a common ingredient without any mention of seasonality.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项建议不适合穷游？,"The correct answer is **C: 向人们要钱**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the suggested methods focus on *reducing expenses* and does **not** include things like begging. Furthermore, the passage specifically states the assumption that travelers will **not** ""beg"" or ""exploit others for personal gain.""

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with the text:

*   **A: 在旅行期间找一些零工做 (Finding odd jobs while traveling)** - The passage mentions that one way to travel cheaply is to ""work while traveling,"" making this a suitable option.
*   **B: 对旅行的舒适度有弹性 (Being flexible with travel comfort)** - The passage states this is for travelers ""willing to sacrifice comfort,"" aligning with this option.
*   **D: 削减餐食和住宿等开支 (Cutting expenses like food and lodging)** - The passage directly states the focus is on ""reducing expenses,"" and specifically mentions minimizing costs.



"
根据这段文字，谁在极其有限的预算下旅行可能会比较困难？,"The correct answer is **D: 喜欢遵循行程的人 (People who like to follow an itinerary)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the ""最低预算旅行攻略"" (Low-Budget Travel Guide) is for those who are willing to sacrifice **comfort and time** and enjoy **surprise**. This implies a flexible, unplanned approach. Someone who likes to follow a strict itinerary would likely *not* be comfortable with the sacrifices and surprises inherent in extremely low-budget travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 喜欢接受挑战的人 (People who like a challenge)** - The passage *targets* people who like a challenge.
*   **B: 没有严格的时间限制的人 (People with no strict time limit)** - The passage mentions sacrificing time, suggesting flexibility is helpful.
*   **C: 计划在旅行期间远程工作的人 (People planning to work remotely during their travels)** - The passage specifically mentions travelling and working as *one* way to travel cheaply, but focuses on the other (minimizing expenses). This option isn’t necessarily disadvantaged.



"
以下哪项陈述没有准确描述从波特马里恩到费尔蒙特的行驶路线？,"The correct answer is **C: 很少遵守限速要求 (Few people adhere to the speed limit)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the importance of *strictly* adhering to the speed limit** in this section of the highway. It emphasizes that the posted speeds are lower than other areas and that following them is more crucial.  This directly contradicts the idea that people rarely follow the speed limit.

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurate based on the passage:

* **A: 有漫长的偏远乡村道路 (There are long stretches of remote country roads)** - The passage directly states this: ""frequently passes through numerous remote areas.""
* **B: 车道狭窄 (The lanes are narrow)** - The passage mentions ""narrow lanes.""
* **D: 手机信号应该不是问题 (Cell service shouldn't be an issue)** - The passage states cell service is *better* than on other routes.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项应该是驾驶员在布法罗-匹兹堡高速公路上行驶时的主要关注点？,"The correct answer is **C: 过快进入急转弯路段**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically highlights the challenges of this section of the highway:** steep hills, narrow lanes, and *sharp curves*. It warns drivers unfamiliar with rural roads to ""stay alert"" due to these features.  The passage also emphasizes the importance of obeying the speed limit because of these conditions.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: 被困在拥堵交通中 (Being stuck in congested traffic):** The passage doesn't mention traffic congestion at all. It focuses on the *nature* of the road, not the amount of traffic.
    * **B: 缺乏充足的手机服务 (Lack of adequate cell service):** The passage actually states that cell service is *better* in this section than on other routes.
    * **D: 频繁遇到道路工程 (Frequent road construction):** Road construction is not mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, the primary concern for drivers, according to the text, is navigating the challenging curves safely.



"
以下哪项不是开始峡谷探险的必要条件？,"The correct answer is **B: 身体处于最佳状态**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that canyoning requires ""relatively little training and physical conditioning"" compared to other sports. This directly contradicts the idea of needing to be in ""peak physical condition."" 

The passage *does* mention swimming, climbing, and jumping as elements of canyoning (making A, C, and D relevant).
"
进行成功的峡谷探险可能需要哪些必要条件？,"The correct answer is **D: 游泳能力**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""溪降结合了游泳、爬山和跳跃的元素..."" (Canyoneering combines elements of swimming, hiking, and jumping...).  This directly links swimming to the activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 优秀的运动能力 (Excellent athleticism):** While helpful, the passage states it requires *relatively little* training and fitness compared to other sports.
* **B: 曾有水肺潜水的经验 (Experience with scuba diving):** The passage contrasts canyoneering with scuba diving, suggesting it *doesn't* require that level of experience.
* **C: 有峡谷探险的认证 (Canyoneering certification):** The passage doesn't mention certification as a *necessary* condition for starting.



"
根据这段文字，对于计划汽车露营的人来说，什么会有帮助？,"The correct answer is **B: 车辆可以让座椅放平**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""If you have a larger minivan, SUV, sedan, or station wagon, *and the seats can fold flat*, then you can car camp."" This makes having flat-folding seats a key requirement for successful car camping according to the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 对你的车的局限有深刻的了解 (A thorough understanding of your car's limitations):** While the passage *mentions* knowing your car's limitations, it doesn't state this is *helpful* for car camping specifically. It's just a general point about driving your own car.
* **C: 一个帐篷 (A tent):** The passage actually implies tents are *less* ideal for this type of travel, stating car camping is a good alternative when ""setting up a tent on private property...can draw unwanted attention.""
* **D: 可供露营的私人地产 (Private property suitable for camping):** Similar to C, the passage suggests avoiding camping on private property.



"
根据这段文字，如果露营者想保持低调，他们可能要避免什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 在城镇或私人地产上搭建帐篷 (Setting up a tent in towns or on private property)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""在私人地产或任何规模的小镇上搭建帐篷，都很容易引起不必要的注意 (Setting up a tent on private property or in any size town is likely to draw unwanted attention).""  This directly links tent camping in those locations to *not* keeping a low profile.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 驾驶较大的车，比如运动型休旅车或小型面包车 (Driving a larger vehicle, such as an SUV or minivan)** - The passage *encourages* using larger vehicles for *car camping* (sleeping in the vehicle), it doesn't say to avoid them for staying low-key.
* **B: 进行更长的公路旅行 (Going on a longer road trip)** - The passage mentions long road trips as having a simple appeal, but doesn't link it to being conspicuous.
* **D: 对他们使用的车辆不熟悉 (Being unfamiliar with the vehicle they're using)** - While knowing your vehicle is mentioned, it's about preparedness, not about staying unnoticed.



"
根据这段文字，谁第二次重建了卡萨布兰卡？,"The correct answer is **D: 摩洛哥苏丹**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""摩洛哥苏丹将该市重建为 Daru l-Badya."" (The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya.) 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 葡萄牙人 (Portuguese)** - The text says the Portuguese *destroyed* and initially rebuilt the city, but it was later abandoned after an earthquake.
*   **B: 西班牙商人 (Spanish merchants)** - Spanish merchants established trading posts *after* it was already rebuilt.
*   **C: 马里尼德人 (Merenids)** - The Merenids used the port strategically, but didn't rebuild it.



"
由于自然灾害，谁放弃了现代城市卡萨布兰卡？,"The correct answer is **B: 葡萄牙人 (Portuguese)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""葡萄牙人毁灭了这座城并进行了重建，还将其命名为卡萨布兰卡 (Casa Branca) ，直到 1755 年地震后才遗弃了它。"" (The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it, also naming it Casa Branca, until it was abandoned after the 1755 earthquake.)

The earthquake is the natural disaster referred to in the question, and the Portuguese abandoned the city *after* it.



"
根据这段文字，辛特拉是如何在外国人中获得认可的？,"The correct answer is **C: 拜伦勋爵的好评 (Byron's praise)**.

The text specifically states that Sintra is ""praised in the writings of Lord Byron"" and ""thus known to foreigners."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 罗卡角 (Cabo da Roca):**  While the bus to Sintra *stops* at Cabo da Roca, it doesn't explain why foreigners know of Sintra.
* **B: 圣母显现 (Apparition of Our Lady):** This refers to Fatima, a different location mentioned in the text.
* **D: 它浪漫的历史 (Its romantic history):** The text *describes* Sintra as romantic, but doesn't say this is *how* foreigners learned about it. Byron's praise is the stated reason.



"
亚美尼亚没有承认什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 新共和国 (New republic)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""However, it [the new republic] did not receive recognition from any country, *including Armenia*.""  Therefore, Armenia did not recognize the new republic that formed with Armenian support in Nagorno-Karabakh.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 纳戈尔诺-卡拉巴赫地区 (Nagorno-Karabakh region):** Armenia didn't not recognize the *region* itself, but the *republic* that was declared within it.
*   **B: 对阿塞拜疆人的战争 (War against Azerbaijanis):** The passage doesn't say Armenia didn't recognize the war. It supported the side that initiated it.
*   **C: 阿塞拜疆的外交纷争 (Azerbaijan's diplomatic disputes):** Armenia was *part of* the diplomatic disputes, it didn't fail to recognize them.



"
什么继续影响阿塞拜疆和亚美尼亚之间的关系？,"The correct answer is **C: 外交纷争 (Diplomatic disputes)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""The region’s diplomatic disputes continued to worsen relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan."" 

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **A: 生活在阿塞拜疆的亚美尼亚人 (Armenians living in Azerbaijan):** While their situation is likely impacted by the conflict, the passage doesn't state they *continue to influence* the relationship.
* **B: 1994 年的战争 (The 1994 war):** The war *caused* the problem, but the passage says it's the ongoing *disputes* stemming from the war that continue to worsen relations.
* **D: 纳戈尔诺-卡拉巴赫地区 (Nagorno-Karabakh region):** The region *is the source* of the disputes, but the disputes themselves are what directly affect the relationship.



"
在夏洛特乘出租车，什么可能会导致额外付费？,"The correct answer is **B: 有三名乘客**.

The passage states: ""乘客超过 2 人则需要额外付费"". This directly answers the question of what causes extra fees for taxis in Charlotte.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 住在另一个地区** - The passage mentions people *moving* from other areas, but not that this affects taxi fares.
*   **C: 去上城区** - While the passage notes growth in family-friendly facilities *in* Uptown Charlotte, it doesn’t say going there impacts taxi costs.
*   **D: 家庭友好** - This is a general characteristic of Charlotte and doesn't relate to taxi fares.



"
根据这段文字，带孩子在夏洛特生活的缺点可能是什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 乘出租车**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that families in Charlotte generally *don't* use taxis because they are expensive with more than 2 passengers. This is presented as a negative aspect of getting around with a family.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 房价** - The passage doesn't mention anything about housing costs.
*   **C: 其他地区的住户** - The passage states people *move* to Charlotte *because* it's family-friendly; this isn't a drawback.
*   **D: 试图享受这个城市** - The passage says it's *enjoyable* for tourists with children, so this is incorrect.



"
在西班牙人到达之前，谁控制了智利北部？,"The correct answer is **D: 印加人**.

The passage states: ""In the 16th century, before the arrival of the Spanish, northern Chile was under Inca rule..."" 

Therefore, the Inca controlled northern Chile before the Spanish arrived."
根据这段文字，以下哪项不是在 1810 年发生的？,"The correct answer is **B: 智利取得了对西班牙人的胜利**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""智利在1810年宣布独立（在拿破仑战争期间，西班牙在数年中没有正常运作的中央政府），但直到1818年才取得对西班牙的决定性胜利。"" (Chile declared its independence in 1810... but did not achieve a decisive victory over Spain until 1818.)

Let's look at the other options:

* **A: 缺少中央政府 (Lack of central government):** The text specifically mentions Spain didn't have a functioning central government during this time.
* **C: 拿破仑战争正在进行 (Napoleonic Wars were ongoing):** The text explicitly states the declaration of independence happened *during* the Napoleonic Wars.
* **D: 智利宣布独立 (Chile declared independence):** The text directly states Chile declared independence in 1810.

Therefore, the only event that *didn't* happen in 1810 was Chile's victory over Spain. It happened in 1818.
"
人们如何才能到达利古里亚地区偏远的村庄？,"The correct answer is **C: 乘坐火车或船只 (ride a train or boat)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""村庄靠道路、火车和船只连接起来，开车无法从外面到达这些村庄。"" (The villages are connected by roads, trains and boats, and you cannot reach these villages by car from the outside.)  This means you can reach them by train *or* boat, but not by car.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 乘坐汽车或船只 (ride a car or boat):** The passage explicitly states you *cannot* reach the villages by car.
* **B: 乘坐汽车或火车 (ride a car or train):** Again, cars are not an option.
* **D: 乘坐飞机或火车 (ride a plane or train):** The passage doesn't mention planes.



"
意大利词语“Cinque Terre”指的是什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 五个村庄** (Five villages).

The passage explicitly states: ""五渔村（Cinque Terre），原意为五块土地，由位于意大利利古里亚（Liguria）地区的五座沿海小村庄...组成。"" (Cinque Terre, originally meaning five lands, consists of five coastal villages located in the Liguria region of Italy...) 

Therefore, ""Cinque Terre"" directly translates to and refers to the five villages.
"
根据这段文字，在潜在的湿滑冬季条件下，哪种靴子最适合？,"The correct answer is **B: 带有鞋钉的靴子**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""有的靴子有鞋钉"" (Some boots have studs). This directly indicates they are a good option for slippery conditions.
* **The passage also emphasizes:** Deep treads (5mm or more) and soft materials are important. Studs *add* to these features, providing even better grip.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 细跟靴子 (High-heeled boots):** The passage specifically recommends *low* and wide heels.
* **C: 高跟靴子 (High-heeled boots):** Same reason as A - high heels are unsuitable.
* **D: 没有 1/5 英寸深鞋纹的靴子 (Boots without a 1/5 inch deep tread):** The passage states treads should be *at least* 5mm (1/5 inch) deep.



"
以下哪项不能帮助增加冰雪路面的摩擦力？,"The correct answer is **D: Water**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that sand, gravel, and salt are spread on roads to *increase* friction. Water, however, is the *cause* of the slippery conditions in the first place – the passage begins by stating that slippery roads and sidewalks are a common cause of winter accidents. 

Therefore, water would *decrease* friction, not increase it."
以下哪项是夏威夷和库克群岛之间的相似之处？,"The correct answer is **C: 它们共享相同的时区**.

The passage explicitly states: ""由于和夏威夷处于同一时区，这些岛屿有时被认为是“南方的夏威夷”."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 它们都有许多大型酒店** - The passage states the Cook Islands *lack* large tourist hotels, and contrasts them with modern Hawaii.
* **B: 它们都没有建州** - The passage only mentions that the Cook Islands haven't been ""built up"" like modern Hawaii, not that neither has been a state.
* **D: 它们都没有城市** - The passage states Cook Islands do not have cities, but doesn't comment on Hawaii.



"
以下哪项对库克群岛的描述是不准确的？,"The correct answer is **C: 主要城市是拉罗汤加岛和艾图塔基岛**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""库克群岛没有城市，而是由 15 个不同的岛屿组成。主要的岛屿有拉罗汤加岛 (Rarotonga) 和艾图塔基岛 (Aitutaki).""  This directly contradicts the statement that Rarotonga and Aitutaki are *cities*.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: 它比夏威夷小** - The passage implies this by saying it's sometimes called ""the Southern Hawaii"" but noting it's smaller.
* **B: 它是一个群岛** - The passage explicitly states: ""It is an archipelago of 15 islands...""
* **D: 这个岛国和夏威夷共享相同的时区** - The passage states: ""Due to being in the same time zone as Hawaii...""



"
以下哪个护林站提供两种住宿选择？,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

The text states: ""塞丽娜（Sirena）是唯一一个除露营之外还提供宿舍住宿和热餐的护林站。"" (Sirena is the only ranger station that offers dorm accommodation and hot meals in addition to camping.)

Therefore, Sirena is the only one offering two types of accommodation."
根据这段文字，如果你想使用现金而不是信用卡，你可以在哪里预订公园许可证？,"The correct answer is **B: 希门尼斯港 (Puerto Jiménez)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""可以直接从希门尼斯港 (Puerto Jiménez) 的公园管理处获得入园许可，但不能使用信用卡"" which translates to ""You can obtain park permits directly from the park administration in Puerto Jiménez, but credit cards are not accepted.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 塞丽娜 (Sirena):** The text doesn't say you can *book* a permit at Sirena, only that you *need* one to stay there.
* **C: CafeNet El Sol:** While CafeNet El Sol *offers* booking services, it charges a fee and the question asks where you can get a permit using cash.
* **D: La Leona:** La Leona is only a campsite and doesn't issue permits.



"
根据这段文字，哪种滑雪是在较陡峭的地形中进行的？,"The correct answer is **C: 阿尔卑斯式滑雪**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""这两项活动要在陡峭的地形上进行，而且需要更硬的滑雪板和靴子。"" and then specifically mentions ""阿尔卑斯式滑雪旅行或登山运动"". This directly links steep terrain to Alpine skiing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 滑雪远足 (Ski touring/Ski hiking)** - The text describes this as *similar* to hiking, implying it doesn't necessarily occur on steep terrain.
*   **B: 越野滑雪 (Cross-country skiing)** - The text states it's usually *not* done with Alpine skiing or mountaineering, and mentions needing good conditions to go far – implying less steep terrain.
*   **D: 滑雪自由行 (Ski touring/Ski hiking)** - This is another name for ski touring/hiking, so it shares the same characteristics as option A.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项可能有助于想要提高速度的越野滑雪者？,"The correct answer is **C: 良好的条件 (Good conditions)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Conditions良好的时候，你可以比步行走得更远——但只有在极少数情况下，你才能获得与不背着沉重背包、在平整的轨道上越野滑雪相同的速度。"" This directly links good conditions to increased speed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 更硬的靴子 (Harder boots):** The text says harder boots are used for *different* types of skiing (Alpine skiing/mountaineering), not cross-country.
* **B: 沉重的背包 (Heavy backpack):** The text specifically says a heavy backpack *hinders* speed – you only get comparable speed *without* one.
* **D: 平整的轨道 (Groomed trails):** While the text mentions speed is comparable on groomed trails, it states this is only a rare occurrence in cross-country skiing. It doesn't suggest seeking out groomed trails to *improve* speed.



"
遭遇重返家园冲击的旅行者很难做什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 重新适应家乡文化 (re-adapt to their home culture)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""对于很容易适应新文化的旅行者来说，有时很难重新适应他们的本土文化"" (For travelers who easily adapt to new cultures, it can sometimes be difficult to re-adapt to their home culture). This is the core of the ""re-entry shock"" described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 适应新地方的文化 (Adapt to a new culture)** - The passage says these travelers *are good* at adapting to new cultures, not that they struggle with it.
* **B: 保持耐心和体谅 (Be patient and understanding)** - The passage says travelers *need* patience and understanding *from others*, not that they struggle to *give* it.
* **C: 出国旅行 (Travel abroad)** - The passage is about the *return* from travel, not the act of traveling itself.



"
根据这段文字，哪种旅行者可能更难适应重返家园的冲击？,"The correct answer is **B: 在国外生活时能迅速适应的旅行者 (Travelers who can quickly adapt to a new culture)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""对于很容易适应新文化的旅行者来说，有时很难重新适应他们的本土文化。"" (For travelers who easily adapt to new cultures, it is sometimes difficult to readjust to their home culture.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 经历过特别糟糕文化冲击的旅行者 (Travelers who have experienced particularly bad culture shock):** The passage focuses on the difficulty of *re*-entry, not initial culture shock.
*   **C: 仍处于蜜月期的旅行者 (Travelers still in the honeymoon phase):** The passage contrasts re-entry shock *with* the honeymoon phase, suggesting someone *past* that phase would be more affected.
*   **D: 耐心不足的旅行者 (Impatient travelers):** While patience is helpful, the passage doesn't say impatience *causes* re-entry shock; it says travelers need patience *from others* during re-entry.



"
人们应该避免对驼鹿做以下哪种事情？,"The correct answer is **B: 慢慢地接近它们**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""有些人不把驼鹿当成潜在的危险，可能会靠得太近，将自己置于危险之中。"" (Some people don't consider moose a potential danger and may get too close, putting themselves in danger.)

This directly implies that getting *close* to moose is something people should avoid.  Slowly approaching them is a way of getting too close.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 忽略它们的存在 (Ignoring their presence)** - The passage doesn't suggest ignoring them, but rather respecting their potential for self-defense.
* **C: 减少它们的潜在威胁程度 (Reducing their potential threat level)** - You shouldn't *try* to reduce their perceived threat, you should avoid *creating* a threat in the first place.
* **D: 在远处观察它们 (Observing them from a distance)** - This is a safe and recommended action – the opposite of what the passage warns against.



"
根据这段文字，关于驼鹿的哪种说法是不正确的？,"The correct answer is **A: 它们是天生具有攻击性的动物**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states specifically that moose are *not* naturally aggressive:** ""驼鹿（也被称为麋鹿）天生不具攻击性"" translates to ""Moose (also known as elk) are not naturally aggressive.""  Option A directly contradicts this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

* **B: 有时它们不被视为潜在的威胁:** The text says ""有些人不把驼鹿当成潜在的危险"" (""Some people do not consider moose a potential danger"").
* **C: 它们可能会被靠近的人所激怒:** The passage implies this by saying they will defend themselves if they *feel threatened* (靠得太近，将自己置于危险之中 - getting too close and putting oneself in danger).
* **D: 必要时它们会自卫:**  The passage states they *will* defend themselves if they feel threatened: ""如果感觉到威胁它们也会自卫"" (""If they feel threatened, they will also defend themselves"").



"
根据这段文字，以下哪种情况对沙漠旅行者来说最不危险？,"The correct answer is **A: 在寒冷的夜晚缺乏保暖衣物**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that lacking warm clothes at night is a *real risk* of hypothermia.** This means it's dangerous.
* **The passage explicitly states that chasing mirages is dangerous** because it wastes energy (C) and water (D).
* **The passage explicitly states that seeing a mirage (B) can be dangerous** because it *leads* to the dangerous actions of chasing it.

Therefore, the *least* dangerous situation, according to the text, is experiencing a cold night *without* the dangerous consequence of lacking warm clothes.  It's still uncomfortable, but not presented as a direct threat like the other options.



"
文章中未提到以下哪种情况可能对沙漠旅行者构成潜在威胁？,"The correct answer is **D: 晒伤**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    * **A: 缺水 (Dehydration):** It states chasing mirages wastes precious water.
    * **B: 海市蜃楼 (Mirages):** It discusses mirages as a dangerous illusion.
    * **C: 低体温症 (Hypothermia):** It specifically warns of the risk of hypothermia at night.

* **The passage does *not* mention:**
    * **D: 晒伤 (Sunburn):**  While the desert is hot, the text focuses on mirages and nighttime cold, not the effects of direct sun exposure.

Therefore, sunburn is the potential threat *not* mentioned in the passage.



"
根据这段文字，哪个群体的人口在探险者到来后受到了很大的影响？,"The correct answer is **C: 泰诺人 (Taínos)**.

The text specifically states: ""在欧洲探险者到来后的短短几年里，西班牙征服者就大大削减了泰诺斯的人口"" (In the short years after the arrival of European explorers, Spanish conquerors greatly reduced the Taíno population). 

The text also mentions the killing of approximately 100,000 Taíno people by Spanish invaders.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 海地人 (Haitians)** - The text doesn't mention the impact on Haitians.
*   **B: 加勒比人 (Caribes)** - While the text mentions Caribs as early settlers, it doesn't state they were significantly impacted *after* European arrival.
*   **D: 西班牙人 (Spaniards)** - The text focuses on the impact *on* the indigenous populations *by* the Spanish, not the other way around.



"
根据这段文字，加勒比人说哪种语言？,"The correct answer is **D: 阿拉瓦克语**.

The text specifically states: ""加勒比人是讲阿拉瓦克语 (Arawakan) 的民族..."" (Caribes are a people who speak the Arawakan language...).
"
谁可以被认为是使滑雪成为一项休闲活动的推广者？,"The correct answer is **B: 挪威人**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""1861年，挪威人在澳大利亚开设了第一家休闲滑雪俱乐部."" This directly indicates that Norwegians were the first to establish a club dedicated to recreational skiing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 滑雪狂人 (Ski fanatics):** While they *enjoy* skiing, the passage doesn't state they *started* it as a leisure activity.
*   **C: 穴居人 (Cave dwellers):** The passage mentions cave paintings depicting skiers, showing skiing existed long ago, but not as a recreational activity in the modern sense.
*   **D: 澳大利亚人 (Australians):** They were the *location* of the first club, not the people who initiated the recreational aspect.



"
根据这段文字，滑雪何时首次被认为是一项运动？,"The correct answer is **D: 17 世纪**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""As a sport, alpine skiing dates back at least to the 17th century..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 18 世纪** - The text says *at least* the 17th century, not the 18th.
* **B: 公元前 5000 年** - While there's evidence of skiing-like activity that far back (cave paintings), the text specifies this is the origin of *skiing* generally, not its recognition *as a sport*.
* **C: 1861 年** - 1861 is when the first recreational ski club was founded, but the text says the sport existed *at least* since the 17th century.



"
以下哪项通常与东非海岸最大的岛屿有关？,"The correct answer is **C: 野生动物**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""马达加斯加是目前为止最大的岛屿，对野生动物来说还是一片独立的大陆。"" (Madagascar is currently the largest island and for wildlife, it is still an independent continent.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 欧洲的影响** - While the passage mentions European influence, it doesn't specifically link it *to* the largest island (Madagascar).
*   **B: 伊斯兰教** - The passage states Islam is prevalent in Comoros and Mayotte, which are *smaller* islands.
*   **D: 豪华度假胜地** - The passage says smaller islands are known for luxury beaches, not the largest one.



"
以下哪项不是较小东非岛屿的特点？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 以野生动物著称 (known for wildlife)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""较小的岛屿大多是独立国家，或所属于法国，它们以豪华海滩度假胜地而闻名。"" (Smaller islands are mostly independent nations or belonging to France, and are known for luxurious beach resorts.)
* **This directly supports options A, B, and D:**
    * **A: 与法国的联系 (Connection with France)** - The passage states some islands ""belong to France"".
    * **B: 许多豪华度假胜地 (Numerous luxury resorts)** - The passage explicitly states they are ""known for luxurious beach resorts.""
    * **D: 独立于其他国家 (Independent from other countries)** - The passage states they are ""mostly independent nations.""
* **However, the passage specifically says that *Madagascar* is the island known for wildlife.** It doesn't mention the smaller islands being known for this.

Therefore, C is the characteristic *not* associated with the smaller East African islands according to the text.



"
根据这段文字，某些特别传统的教会如何庆祝复活节？,"The correct answer is **B: 举办周六晚上的守夜**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""More traditional churches often hold Easter vigils on Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with the congregation typically surging into celebration as the midnight bells toll, celebrating the resurrection of Christ.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 举行祈求丰收的仪式 (Hold a ritual to pray for a good harvest):** The passage suggests this *might* be the origin of the tradition, but doesn't state traditional churches *currently* do this.
* **C: 为会众举办春季聚会 (Host a spring gathering for the congregation):** While related to the origins, the passage specifically describes a *vigil*, not just a gathering.
* **D: 观看日出 (Watch the sunrise):** The passage mentions this as a separate tradition, but doesn't link it to the specifically ""more traditional churches.""



"
为了避免进入厄瓜多尔时的某些要求，古巴公民必须首先拥有什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 美国绿卡 (American green card)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""持有美国绿卡的古巴公民应访问厄瓜多尔领事馆获得对此要求的豁免。"" (Cuban citizens holding a US green card should visit the Ecuadorian consulate to obtain an exemption from these requirements.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 有护照离出发日期有 6 个月 (Passport valid for at least 6 months)** - This is a *requirement* for all travelers, not something that *avoids* requirements.
*   **B: 合法的邀请函 (Legal invitation letter)** - This is a requirement *unless* you have a US green card.
*   **C: 往返机票以证明停留时间 (Round-trip ticket to prove length of stay)** - This is a requirement *regardless* of citizenship or green card status.



"
厄瓜多尔的旅行要求不是为了什么而设计的？,"The correct answer is **A: 尽量减少旅客数量 (Minimize the number of travelers)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the requirements are ""designed to achieve orderly migration between the two countries.""** This directly supports option B and D.
* **The requirement for a return/onward ticket (option C) is specifically to *confirm* the length of stay.**
* **The passage *doesn't* mention anything about trying to reduce the number of travelers.** In fact, the requirements are about *managing* those who do travel, not preventing travel altogether.

Therefore, minimizing the number of travelers is not the purpose of these requirements.



"
在国外购买以下哪种东西可能比在国内更贵？,"The correct answer is **B: 高端镜架 (High-end frames)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...正品进口镜架可能比在国内购买要贵 (Genuine imported frames may be more expensive than buying domestically).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 眼部检查 (Eye exam):** The passage suggests getting the eye exam *in your home country* especially if insurance covers it.
* **C: 视力保险 (Vision insurance):** The passage doesn't mention anything about the cost of vision insurance being higher or lower abroad.
* **D: 非品牌镜架 (Non-branded frames):** The passage implies non-branded frames might be *cheaper* due to lower labor costs in some countries.



"
在国外购买高端镜架的潜在风险是什么？,"The correct answer is **C: They might be fake.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""有些可能是山寨货"" which translates to ""some might be counterfeits"" or ""some might be fake."" This directly addresses the risk of purchasing fake high-end frames abroad.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: 可能需要额外的眼部检查 (Might need extra eye exams):** The passage suggests getting the exam *done at home* and taking the prescription elsewhere, not needing additional exams.
*   **B: 处方可能不适用于某些镜架 (Prescription might not be suitable for certain frames):** This isn't mentioned in the passage. A prescription should work with various frame styles.
*   **D: 保险可能不报销成本 (Insurance might not cover the cost):** While true in general, the passage focuses on the risk *of the frames themselves*, not insurance coverage.



"
关于福克兰群岛的货币使用，以下哪项陈述是正确的？,"The correct answer is **D: 除了福克兰英镑外，英镑通常是最被接受的货币.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""英镑一般在岛上所有地方都通用"" (Pound Sterling is generally accepted everywhere on the island).  This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 在外围岛屿上只有信用卡和英镑被接受 (Only credit cards and Pound Sterling are accepted on the outer islands):** The passage says US dollars *are also* accepted on the outer islands, along with English and US currency.
* **B: 斯坦利是唯一接受美元的地方 (Stanley is the only place that accepts US dollars):** The passage states US dollars are accepted on the outer islands as well.
* **C: 离开福克兰群岛后应该兑换福克兰英镑 (Falkland Islands Pound should be exchanged after leaving the Falkland Islands):** The passage explicitly says it's *almost impossible* to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands and to exchange it *before* leaving.



"
根据这段文字，在从美国前往福克兰群岛时，以下哪个地方使用除信用卡外的支付方式可能特别有用？,"The correct answer is **C: 在外围岛屿上**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""在外围岛屿，可能无法使用信用卡，但可以使用英美货币；请事先与房主联系，确认可接受的付款方式。"" (On the outer islands, credit cards may not be accepted, but US and British currency are; contact the homeowner beforehand to confirm acceptable forms of payment.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 在 FIC West 商店 (In the FIC West store):** The passage mentions the bank is *opposite* FIC West, not that it's a place where other currencies are particularly useful.
* **B: 在所有岛屿上 (On all islands):** The passage specifically highlights the outer islands as being different in terms of payment options.
* **D: 在斯坦利全境 (Throughout Stanley):** The passage states credit cards and US dollars are *often* accepted in Stanley.



"
以下哪个事件与寺庙节庆的庆祝活动无关？,"The correct answer is **A: 大象的诞生 (The birth of an elephant)**.

Here's why:

The passage states temple festivals celebrate:

*   Temple anniversaries (寺庙周年纪念日)
*   The birthdays of presiding deities (主持神的生日)
*   Other important temple events (与寺庙相关的大事)

While elephants *are* featured *in* the festivals (through parades), their birth is not a *reason* for the festivals themselves. The festivals are centered around the temple and its deities, not the animals participating.



"
在哪里可以看到装饰华丽的大象？,"The correct answer is **C: 在寺庙节庆的游行中**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""喀拉拉邦的寺庙节日极其有趣，通常有装饰华丽的大象游行...""  This directly links the decorated elephants to the temple festival processions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 从十一月底到五月中旬的各个地方** - This is the *time period* of the festivals, not a *location* where you see the elephants.
* **B: 在寺庙里** - While elephants are present *at* the temple during festivals, the passage specifically mentions them in the *parades*.
* **D: 在喀拉拉邦的街头** -  The passage doesn't mention seeing them just wandering in the streets, but specifically as part of the organized temple processions.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项是最有可能在商务舱或头等舱机票上省钱的方法？,"The correct answer is **A: Through company reimbursement**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...or, a better way is to have your company pay for you to fly."" This directly suggests company reimbursement as a method to enjoy premium cabins without personally bearing the full cost.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Booking first class instead of business class:** The passage states first class is *more* expensive (11x economy vs. 4x for business), so this wouldn't save money.
* **C: Booking non-direct first class flights:** The passage says discounts on business or first class for direct flights are rare. Non-direct flights aren't mentioned as a way to find discounts.
* **D: Looking for discounts:** The passage explicitly states ""Generally, there's no point looking for discounts on business or first class for direct routes.""



"
根据这段文字，预订某些票价舱位时，搜索什么是浪费时间？,"The correct answer is **C: 折扣**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Generally, there's no point looking for discounts on business or first class for direct flights from A to B."" This directly indicates that searching for discounts on these higher cabin classes is a waste of time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 直达航班 (Direct flights)** - The passage doesn't say searching for direct flights is a waste of time, it says discounts *on* direct flights in higher cabins are pointless.
*   **B: 商务舱 (Business class)** - The passage acknowledges business class exists and is expensive, it doesn't say searching for it is a waste of time - just that discounts are hard to find.
*   **D: 头等舱 (First class)** - Similar to business class, the passage discusses first class's high cost but doesn't say searching for it is pointless, only that discounts are unlikely.



"
在将非洲总票价与环球旅行票价进行比较时，哪项不需要添加？,"The correct answer is **B: 非洲离境税的费用**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""对于非洲以外的所有地区，别忘了加上额外的签证费、离境税、地面交通等费用."" This means these costs are *only* for areas *outside* of Africa.  We are comparing the *total cost to Africa* against a round-the-world ticket. Therefore, we only need to add costs for the non-African portions of a round-the-world ticket.

*   **A: 非洲以外的地区额外的签证费** - Needs to be added for comparison.
*   **C: 非洲签证的费用** - This isn't mentioned as needing to be added to the African total.
*   **D: 非洲以外的地区的地面交通费用** - Needs to be added for comparison.
*   **B: 非洲离境税的费用** - This is a cost *within* Africa, and therefore doesn't need to be added when comparing the African trip cost to the round-the-world ticket cost.
"
根据这段文字，超市开始提供更多种类的什么选择？,"The correct answer is **A: 成品食品**.

The passage states: ""超市里成品食品的种类越来越多。"" (Supermarkets are offering more and more varieties of pre-made food.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 微波炉 (Microwaves):** While the passage mentions some foods *can* be heated with microwaves, it doesn't say the supermarket is offering *more* microwaves.
* **C: 现场餐厅 (On-site restaurants):** The passage mentions restaurants exist in some places, but doesn't say supermarkets are increasing their offerings of them.
* **D: 实惠的价格 (Affordable prices):** The passage mentions affordable prices in relation to restaurants, but not specifically that supermarkets are offering more affordable *options* overall.



"
超市提供的哪项便利设施可能会吸引购买成品食品的顾客？,"The correct answer is **D: 微波炉**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""有些甚至提供微波炉或其他方法用来加热食品。"" (Some even provide microwaves or other methods for heating food.) This directly links microwaves to the convenience of buying pre-made food.  If you're buying food that needs heating and the store provides a microwave, it's more appealing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 现场餐厅 (On-site restaurant):** While the passage mentions restaurants as an alternative, it doesn't say they're a *convenience* offered *by* the supermarket to encourage ready-made food purchases.  They're presented as a separate option.
* **B: 较少种类的选择 (Fewer choices):** The passage says the *opposite* – that there are *increasing* varieties of pre-made food.
* **C: 生食 (Raw food):** The passage discusses pre-made foods, implying they are not raw and require some form of preparation, hence the need for microwaves.



"
哪项可能不为说法语的比利时人和瑞士人所理解？,"The correct answer is **A: 标准的法国度量系统 (Standard French metric system)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that even though Belgian and Swiss French have some differences, speakers *can* understand standard French, *even* when it uses the standard French metric system.  This implies the metric system is not the source of confusion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 特殊的法语单词 (Specific French words):** The passage says they have differences in *some* words, but they understand standard French.
* **C: 一些法语单词的发音 (Some French pronunciations):**  The passage explicitly mentions slight pronunciation differences.
* **D: 在法国讲的大部分法语 (Most of the French spoken in France):** Because they learn standard French in school, they can understand most French spoken in France.

Therefore, the metric system is the only option presented that isn't said to be understood.



"
以下哪项在法国与在比利时或瑞士不同？,"The correct answer is **A: 所有单词的发音**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...some words are pronounced slightly differently."" This means *not all* words are pronounced differently, just *some*.
* **The passage states:** ""...they will understand you even if you use the standard French measurement system."" This eliminates B.
* **The passage states:** ""...all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss learn standard French in school..."" This eliminates C.
* **The passage doesn't mention any differences in spelling.** This eliminates D.

Therefore, the only option that accurately reflects a difference mentioned in the text is that **some word pronunciations** differ between France and Belgium/Switzerland.  ""All word pronunciations"" is the closest and most accurate answer of the choices given, as the passage focuses on pronunciation as a difference.



"
在哪种情况下你不太可能被提供丧亲票价？,"The correct answer is **C: 如果你从巴黎搭乘汉莎航空公司前往美国**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Lufthansa offers bereavement fares *from the US or Canada*. Therefore, a flight originating in Paris wouldn't qualify.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 如果你搭乘西捷航空:** WestJet *does* offer bereavement fares according to the passage.
* **B: 如果你尝试直接向航空公司订票而不是第三方服务:** The passage explicitly states you *must* call the airline directly.
* **D: 如果你搭乘达美航空:** Delta *does* offer bereavement fares according to the passage.



"
关于丧亲票价，哪项是正确的？,"The correct answer is **D: 它们必须通过电话直接向航空公司预订 (They must be booked directly with the airline by phone)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""无论情况如何，你都必须直接打电话向航空公司订票."" (Regardless of the situation, you must call the airline directly to book.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 它们涵盖葬礼出行的费用 (They cover the costs of funeral travel)** - While the tickets are *for* travel to a funeral, the passage doesn't say they *cover* all costs, just that they're cheaper than last-minute fares.
* **B: 它们必须直接在航空公司网站上预订 (They must be booked directly on the airline's website)** - The passage specifically states they must be booked *by phone*, not online.
* **C: 它们涵盖临时出行的费用 (They cover the costs of emergency travel)** - The passage says they are cheaper *than* emergency travel, but don't cover the costs themselves.



"
什么情况下使用独立的 GPS 设备比 GPS 导航应用更方便？,"The correct answer is **C: 当你将超出服务范围时 (When you will be out of service range)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""If your phone does not have a data connection, or is not in service range, the phone’s performance may be limited, or the phone may be unusable.""  This directly implies that a dedicated GPS device would be *more* convenient when you anticipate being without cell service.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 当你想省钱时 (When you want to save money)** - The passage says the app is *more* cost-effective.
* **B: 当你确定你会有数据连接时 (When you are sure you will have a data connection)** - This makes the app work well, but doesn't make a dedicated GPS *better*.
* **D: 当你不想租设备时 (When you don't want to rent a device)** - The app is an alternative to renting, but doesn't make a dedicated GPS more convenient in that situation.



"
相对于独立设备，使用 GPS 导航应用的一个不好的理由是什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 不需要担心数据连接** (No need to worry about data connection).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""如果你的手机没有数据连接，或者不在服务范围，手机的性能可能会受限，或者无法使用手机."" (If your phone doesn't have a data connection, or is not in service, the phone's performance may be limited, or unusable).  This directly identifies a *disadvantage* – reliance on data connection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 省钱** (Saving money) - The passage states this is an *advantage* of using a GPS app.
* **C: 避免租赁** (Avoiding rental) - The passage states this is an *advantage* of using a GPS app.
* **D: 不需要购买新地图** (No need to buy new maps) - While potentially true, the passage doesn't explicitly mention map updates as an advantage or disadvantage.



"
根据这段文字，如何才能确保你匹配到合适的船只？,"The correct answer is **C: 通过专门从事加拉帕戈斯旅游的代理预订**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""一定要确保你预订行程的代理是一位对各种船只拥有丰富知识的加拉帕戈斯群岛（Galapagos）专家。 这能确保你的某项兴趣和/或约束条件能与最适合他们的船只相互匹配。""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 与兴趣相似的 8 名或以上乘客一起预订:** The text mentions boat sizes (8 to 100 people) but doesn't say anything about needing to travel with people who share your interests.
*   **B: 在淡季预订:** The text mentions boats are *full* in the high season, implying booking early is important, but doesn’t suggest booking in the off-season guarantees a good match.
*   **D: 提前很久预订:** While the text does say to book early, it emphasizes the *expertise of the agent* as the key to finding the right boat, not just booking far in advance.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不是用来保持赌客继续赌博的策略？,"The correct answer is **A: 充足的自然光 (Abundant natural light)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states casinos *lack* windows** (and therefore natural light) as a strategy to keep people inside.  The aim is to disorient guests and make them lose track of time.
* **B: 免费音乐会门票等激励措施 (Free concert tickets and other incentives)** is a type of ""special food, beverages and entertainment"" mentioned in the text.
* **C: 免费饮料 (Free beverages)** is directly mentioned as a tactic casinos use.
* **D: 没有时钟 (No clocks)** is also explicitly stated as a strategy.

Therefore, abundant natural light is the *opposite* of what casinos do to encourage gambling.



"
根据这段文字，聪明的赌徒应该避免什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 喝太多酒精饮料 (Drink too much alcohol)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""然而，醉酒会削弱人的判断能力，所有优秀的赌徒都知道保持清醒的重要性。"" (However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 接受任何激励措施 (Accept any incentives):** The passage mentions food, drinks and entertainment as things casinos *offer*, not things to avoid.
* **C: 检查时钟或手表 (Check clocks or watches):**  The passage points out casinos *don't have* clocks, so checking them isn't possible anyway, and it isn't presented as something a smart gambler avoids.
* **D: 询问最近的出口 (Ask for the nearest exit):** The passage says exits are difficult to find, but doesn’t suggest avoiding asking about them. It just explains why casinos make them hard to locate.



"
根据这段文字，句子中间的哪个词性要大写？,"The correct answer is **B: 名词**.

The text specifically states: ""除去表示您的“Sie”之外的所有名词都应以大写字母开头，即使在句子中间也应如此。""  This means all nouns, even mid-sentence, should be capitalized.

While the text *mentions* verbs and adjectives in relation to needing to distinguish them from nominalized forms (verbs/adjectives *used as* nouns), it doesn't say those word types themselves are to be capitalized. It's the **nouns** that are always capitalized.



"
根据这段文字，名词的大写可能会使什么更加困难？,"The correct answer is **C: 书写 (Writing)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...this can also make reading easier, *though it does make writing more complex*, as you need to judge whether verbs or adjectives are being used as nominalizations.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 阅读 (Reading):** The passage says this rule *makes reading easier*.
*   **B: 区分动词 (Distinguishing verbs):** While the rule *relies* on distinguishing verbs (to know if they've been nominalized), it doesn't make distinguishing verbs *harder*.
*   **D: 区分宾语 (Distinguishing objects):** The passage mentions distinguishing verbs and objects as a *reason* for the rule, but doesn’t say the rule makes it harder to do so.



"
在马来西亚的农村地区，哪个手势表示“过来”？,"The correct answer is **B: 挥手**.

The passage states: ""在马来西亚，至少在农村地区的马来人中，这个手势类似于在某些西方国家用食指朝自己身体摆动，表示“过来”，并且这个手势仅用来表示这个意思。""  ""这个手势"" refers to waving.

Therefore, waving means ""come here"" in rural Malaysia.
"
根据这段文字，哪个手势可能意味着“回来”？,"The correct answer is **A: 手掌向内挥手**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that in Spain, British tourists might interpret a wave with the palm facing *towards* the waver as a gesture to ""come back."" This is a hand gesture with the palm facing inwards.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 弯曲食指 (Curved index finger):** The text mentions this gesture in relation to Malaysia, meaning ""come here,"" not ""come back.""
*   **C: 手掌向外挥手 (Wave with palm outwards):** This is generally understood as a friendly greeting or goodbye.
*   **D: 点头 (Nodding):** The text does not mention nodding at all.



"
根据这段文字，什么导致冰裂隙的出现？,"The correct answer is **B: 不稳定的冰川 (Unstable glaciers)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""冰川并不是稳定的，而会从山上流下来。这会导致出现裂缝和冰裂隙..."" (Glaciers are not stable and flow down from the mountains. This leads to the formation of cracks and crevasses...).  

This directly links the *instability* of glaciers to the creation of crevasses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 雪桥 (Snow bridges)** - Snow bridges *cover* crevasses, they don't *cause* them.
*   **C: 坍塌的冰洞 (Collapsing ice caves)** - While cave collapses are mentioned as a hazard, they aren't the initial cause of crevasses.
*   **D: 松动的冰块 (Loose ice blocks)** -  Loose ice blocks happen at the *edges* of glaciers, a result of crevasses and glacier flow, not the cause of them.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪个可能被雪桥掩盖？,"The correct answer is **A: 裂缝 (Cracks)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""这些裂隙可能会被雪桥掩盖"" which translates to ""These cracks might be covered by snow bridges."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 冰洞 (Ice caves):** The passage mentions ice caves *collapsing*, not being covered by snow bridges.
* **C: 墙壁 (Walls):** The passage mentions ice cave walls collapsing, but not being covered.
* **D: 巨大冰块 (Large blocks of ice):** The passage says these *fall* or *roll* away, not that they are covered.



"
根据这段文字，在参观哪个地方之前，旅行者应该采取额外的预防措施？,"The correct answer is **B: 戈马周边地区**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""尽管戈马还算安全，但前往戈马以外的任何地方都应该事先调查，以便了解北基伍省持续的战斗有没有缓和。"" This directly indicates that travelers should take extra precautions *before* venturing outside of Goma due to ongoing conflict in the surrounding North Kivu province.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 尼拉贡戈火山:** The text mentions Nyiragongo as a destination *from* Goma, not a place requiring extra precautions within the text.
*   **C: 镇中心:** The text says the town center was damaged by lava, but doesn't suggest it's currently unsafe.
*   **D: 卢旺达:** Rwanda is simply mentioned as being *near* Goma; there's no information about safety concerns there.



"
以下哪项不是给戈马游客的好建议？,"The correct answer is **A: 北基伍的战斗很有趣**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...you should investigate beforehand to understand if the ongoing fighting in North Kivu has calmed down."" This implies the fighting is *not* something to be sought out or considered ""fun."" It's a safety concern.

Let's look at why the other options *are* good advice based on the text:

* **B: 是便宜的追踪山地大猩猩的好地方** - The passage explicitly says Goma is a base for ""the cheapest gorilla trekking in Africa.""
* **C: 出租的摩托车是一个好的交通方式** - The passage mentions you can tour Goma by *boda-boda* (motorcycle taxis) and gives a price example.
* **D: 攀登尼拉贡戈火山的基地位于城市中** - The passage states Goma is ""a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano.""



"
如果计划在八月份的某一天开始野营，什么时候能够获得野地露营许可证？,"The correct answer is **B: 4 月 1 日**.

Here's why:

The passage states that permits are released four months *before* the departure month, on the first day of that month. If the departure month is August, four months prior is April. Therefore, permits become available on April 1st.
"
为保护峡谷实施了哪项政策？,"The correct answer is **D: 许可证数量有限 (Licenses are limited in number)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""为了保护大峡谷，许可证限量发放 (To protect the Grand Canyon, permits are limited).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 先到先得的许可证系统 (First-come, first-served permit system):**  While a small number of permits *are* first-come, first-served, this isn't the *primary* policy for protecting the canyon - it's a fallback.
* **B: 许可证仅在 1 月 1 日提供 (Permits are only available on January 1st):** The passage says permits become available *starting* January 1st for May trips, but they are released throughout the year based on departure month.
* **C: 只有通过未经预约的到访才能获得许可证 (Permits are only available through unreserved visits):**  The passage states that reservations are preferred and more likely to succeed. Unreserved visits have a *limited* number of permits available.



"
以下哪项最不可能出现在文中描述的那种酒店？,"The correct answer is **D: 最近翻新的客房进行了现代化升级** (Recently renovated rooms with modern upgrades).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states these hotels are characterized by ""缺乏最新设施"" (lack of the latest facilities) and ""颇具年代感的优雅韵味"" (a vintage elegance).**  Modern upgrades would contradict these core characteristics.

Let's look at why the other options *would* be found in such a hotel:

* **A: 鸡尾酒酒吧 (Cocktail bars):** The passage mentions ""夜生活场所"" (nightlife venues), and cocktail bars would be a common feature of high-end establishments in that era.
* **B: 内设高档餐厅 (On-site upscale restaurants):** The passage specifically states these hotels ""通常有高档餐厅"" (usually had upscale restaurants).
* **C: 其他客人是著名或公众熟识的人物 (Other guests who are famous or publicly known figures):** The passage says these hotels were ""当时富人和名人的落脚处"" (the haven of the rich and famous at the time).



"
根据这段文字提供的信息，酒店客人最不可能优先考虑以下哪项服务？,"The correct answer is **D: 房间价格实惠**.

Here's why:

The passage describes hotels catering to the *wealthy* and *famous*. It emphasizes their luxurious nature (""high-end restaurants and nightlife,"" ""elegant charm"") and historical significance. These hotels were frequented by people who could afford to travel extensively (""a wealthy traveler might fly around the world"").  

Therefore, it's highly unlikely a guest choosing this type of hotel would prioritize *affordability*. The other options are all explicitly mentioned as characteristics of these hotels:

* **A: 整个酒店都配有古董家具 (Antique furniture throughout the hotel)** - The passage highlights their ""traditional furnishings"" and ""vintage charm.""
* **B: 拥有杰出厨师的餐厅 (Restaurants with outstanding chefs)** -  ""High-end restaurants"" are specifically mentioned.
* **C: 提供夜间娱乐活动的休息室 (Lounges offering evening entertainment)** - ""Nightlife"" is also mentioned as a feature.

**Therefore, D is the least likely priority for a guest at these hotels.**



"
根据这段文字，去格陵兰岛旅游时应该避免什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 称格陵兰的土著居民为“爱斯基摩人”**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""While the term 'Eskimo' is still acceptable in the United States, many non-Americans in the Arctic, especially Canadians, find it derogatory. Although you may hear locals use the term, foreigners should avoid it.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 某些以高犯罪率著称的区域** - The text says crime is ""almost unheard of"" and there are no ""high-crime areas.""
*   **B: 带来厚重的衣服，因为该地气候全年通常温暖** - The text explicitly warns to bring warm clothes, especially in colder seasons, and notes it gets colder the further north you go.
*   **C: 期望在那里工作，因为网络连接可能不稳定** - The text states that 93% of the population has internet access and there are internet cafes/public wifi available. It doesn't mention issues with working remotely.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项对于未做好准备的格陵兰游客来说可能成为问题？,"The correct answer is **C: 天气**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""严寒也许是没有准备的人将面临的唯一真正的危险。 如果你在寒冷的季节到访格陵兰岛（记住越往北走越冷），一定要带够保暖衣物。""  This directly highlights the weather (specifically the cold) as a potential problem for unprepared visitors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 北欧蚊子:** While the text mentions mosquitoes, it says they are *uncomfortable* not dangerous.
*   **B: 犯罪:** The text states that crime is ""almost unheard of.""
*   **D: 当地人:** The text doesn't suggest any issues with the local people. It even provides guidance on respectful terminology.



"
以下哪项现在被用作中心广场？,"The correct answer is **A: 联盟花园 (Jardín de la Unión)**.

The text states: ""Now it has become a central square, bustling with activity day and night."" and this refers to the Jardín de la Unión.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 亲吻小巷 (Callejon del Beso)** - It's described as an alley with balconies, not a square.
*   **C: 圣地亚哥圣殿 (Santiago Temple)** - It's mentioned as the *only surviving building* from the former monastery, but not as the square itself.
*   **D: Callejon del Beso** - Same as B, it's an alley."
根据这段文字，以下哪项不会在联盟花园中出现？,"The correct answer is **D: 一个古老的修道院建筑 (An ancient monastery building)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Here was a courtyard of a 17th-century monastery, with the Temple of Santiago being the *only* surviving structure."" This means most of the monastery is *not* there anymore, only one temple remains.

Let's look at why the other options *are* found in Jardín de la Unión:

* **A: 一个有音乐会的中央凉亭 (A central gazebo with concerts):** The text explicitly says ""In the afternoons and evenings, the central gazebo often has free concerts.""
* **B: 一个古老的爱情传说发生的地方 (A place where an ancient love legend took place):**  Callejon del Beso, connected to the garden, *is* where the love legend happened.
* **C: 面向花园的餐馆 (Restaurants facing the garden):** The text states ""There are many restaurants around the garden.""



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项关于单日徒步旅行的陈述是不准确的？,"The correct answer is **D: 有婴儿的家庭不适合进行单日徒步旅行这项户外活动**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""有小孩的家庭可能需要做更多的准备，但即使带着婴儿和学龄前儿童，在户外待一天也不难。"" (Families with children may need to do more preparation, but even with babies and preschoolers, spending a day outdoors is not difficult.)

This directly contradicts option D, which claims families with babies are *not* suitable for day hikes.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate:

*   **A:** The passage says ""沿着一条平缓的小径远足一天几乎不需要什么准备"" (Hiking a gentle trail for a day requires very little preparation).
*   **B:** The passage defines a day hike as ""一天内走完的行程"" (a trip completed within a day).
*   **C:** The passage states ""任何人只要身体不算差，都可以享受远足的乐趣"" (Anyone who is not in poor physical condition can enjoy hiking).



"
根据这段文字，什么情况下单日徒步旅行需要很少的准备？,"The correct answer is **B: 当涉及较平缓的小径时**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""沿着一条平缓的小径远足一天几乎不需要什么准备...""  This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 徒步者身体健康** - While being in decent shape *allows* anyone to enjoy hiking, the passage doesn't say it makes the preparation *minimal*.
*   **C: 儿童参加徒步旅行时** - The passage states families *need to do more* preparation when children are involved.
*   **D: 徒步旅行在更自然的环境中时** - The passage mentions the natural environment in general, but doesn't connect it to requiring less preparation.



"
罗加兰或阿格德的高原与挪威其他地方的高原有何不同？,"The correct answer is **D: 通常长满石南** (usually covered in heather).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""In Rogaland and Agder, they are colloquially called “hei”, meaning treeless wilderness, **often covered in heather**."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 它们有树 (They have trees)** - The passage states ""vidde"" (and ""hei"") are treeless spaces.
* **B: 没有峡湾 (No fjords)** - The passage contrasts the fjords *with* the highlands, not says the highlands lack fjords.
* **C: 高原地形大多平坦 (The highland terrain is mostly flat)** - The passage describes the highlands as ""high, more or less undulating plateaus.""  ""Undulating"" means having a smoothly rising and falling form, not flat.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不是挪威的典型地貌？,"The correct answer is **B: 森林高原**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that ""vidde"" (highlands) are ""open, exposed, treeless spaces.""**  Similarly, ""hei"" are described as ""treeless wilderness."" This means forests are *not* a typical feature of the highlands.
* **A: 开阔的土地 (Open land)** - ""vidde"" is defined as a broad, open space.
* **C: 陡峭的峡湾 (Steep fjords)** - The passage begins by stating that steep fjords are a typical landform in Norway.
* **D: 荒原 (Wilderness/Heath)** - ""hei"" directly translates to treeless wilderness and is described as a typical landform.

Therefore, a *forested* highland goes against the description provided in the text."
对滑雪感兴趣的游客什么时候应该去山中避暑之地？,"The correct answer is **A: 在冬季 (In winter)**.

The passage explicitly states that winter offers snow ""just right"" for activities like skiing and snowboarding. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 在旺季 (In peak season)** - Peak season is during the Indian summer, not when there's snow for winter sports.
* **C: 在印度的夏季 (In the Indian summer)** - The passage contrasts summer (peak season) *with* the beauty of winter.
* **D: 在春季 (In spring)** - Spring isn't mentioned in relation to snow or skiing.



"
根据这段文字，通常什么时候山中避暑之地有最多的游客？,"The correct answer is **C: 在印度的夏季**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""山中避暑之地的旅游旺季通常是在印度的夏季。"" (The peak tourist season for hill stations is usually during the Indian summer.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 在大雪期间 (During heavy snowfall):** While snow is mentioned as a winter attraction, the text doesn't say this is *peak* season.
*   **B: 整个滑板滑雪季节 (Throughout the snowboarding season):**  Snowboarding is an activity *available* in winter, but not the reason for the peak season.
*   **D: 整个冬季月份 (Throughout the winter months):** Winter is mentioned for its beauty and activities, but the peak season is specifically during the Indian summer.



"
如果你想找到一艘寻求帮助的船，你应该避免做什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 在码头上来回走动 (Walking back and forth at the dock)**.

The passage *specifically* suggests walking around the dock as a way to find opportunities – it's a positive action to take. The question asks what you should *avoid* doing.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 和船长交朋友 (Making friends with captains):** This isn't mentioned as something to avoid; in fact, building relationships is implied.
* **C: 宣传你的服务 (Advertising your services):** The passage explicitly states ""你可以张贴告示，告知他人你可以提供帮助"" (You can post notices letting others know you can help).
* **D: 无视其他搭船者 (Ignoring other hitchhikers):** The passage encourages interacting with other people at the dock.



"
如果你想在港口周围寻找需要帮助的船，应该做什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 与水手接触 (Contact sailors)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states to ""接触正在清理游艇的人或酒吧里的水手等等"" (contact people cleaning yachts or sailors in bars, etc.) and to ""try to chat with as many people as possible."" This directly supports making contact with sailors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 保持低调 (Keep a low profile):** The passage encourages being *visible* and interacting with people, the opposite of keeping a low profile.
* **C: 只在他们清洁游艇时接近人 (Only approach people when they are cleaning yachts):** While cleaning yachts is *one* way to find people, the passage suggests broader contact – including sailors in bars.
* **D: 避开其他搭船者 (Avoid other hitchhikers):** The passage specifically suggests you *will* meet other hitchhikers and they will share information.



"
哪个地点会吸引对该岛殖民历史感兴趣的旅客？,"The correct answer is **A: 北岸 (North Shore)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Here is where the British colonists landed, so if you are looking for evidence of this territory's colonial history, this is a good place to start.""  And it identifies ""here"" as the North Shore where most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is located.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 九龙海滨 (Kowloon Waterfront):** The passage says this is a *good place to view* Hong Kong, not to learn about its history.
*   **C: 香港市中心 (Hong Kong City Center):** This isn't specifically mentioned in relation to colonial history.
*   **D: 维多利亚港 (Victoria Harbour):** While iconic, it's the *backdrop* to the island, not a source of historical evidence itself.



"
哪个地点会吸引优先考虑迷人景色的游客？,"The correct answer is **D: 九龙海滨**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""若想从最佳角度欣赏香港的美景，可以离开该岛，前往对面的九龙海滨。"" (If you want to enjoy the best view of Hong Kong, you can leave the island and go to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 维多利亚港 (Victoria Harbour)** - While beautiful, the passage suggests going *to* the Kowloon waterfront *to view* Victoria Harbour, not that the harbour itself is the best viewing spot.
*   **B: 香港本土 (Hong Kong itself)** - Too broad and doesn't pinpoint a specific location for the best views.
*   **C: 香港岛 (Hong Kong Island)** - The passage states you need to *leave* the island to get the best views.



"
一些马鞍的什么特点有助于减少骑手的脚被马镫卡住的风险？,"The correct answer is **B: 安全扣**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""一些马鞍——尤其是英式马鞍——配有安全扣，如果落马的骑手向后拉，马镫皮带就会从马鞍上掉下来。"" (Some saddles—especially English saddles—have safety stirrups, where the stirrup leathers will detach from the saddle if a falling rider pulls back.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 窄鞋底 (Narrow shoe soles):** While the passage mentions narrow, smooth-soled boots, it doesn't say the *saddle* has this feature.  The boots themselves are the feature.
* **C: 皮革马镫 (Leather stirrups):** The passage doesn't focus on the *material* of the stirrups, but on a mechanism for releasing them.
* **D: 更高的稳定性 (Greater stability):** The passage states stirrups *provide* stability, but doesn't say the saddle has a feature specifically to prevent getting stuck.  The stability is a benefit, not a safety feature related to getting un-stuck.



"
马靴的哪个特征有助于在使用马镫时提高骑手的安全性？,"The correct answer is **C: 鞋跟 (heel)**.

Here's why:

The passage states riders wear boots with heels ""to minimize this risk."" The heel prevents the foot from sliding *completely* through the stirrup, which is what causes the dragging hazard.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 粗糙的、狭窄的鞋底 (rough, narrow sole)** - The passage specifically mentions a *smooth* and *narrow* sole, not a rough one.
*   **B: 皮革 (leather)** - While boots are likely made of leather, the passage doesn't highlight leather as a safety feature.
*   **D: 宽鞋底 (wide sole)** - A wide sole would actually *increase* the chance of the foot getting stuck.



"
通过食宿交换网络向旅客提供什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 与当地房东一起的住宿 (Accommodation with local hosts)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""食宿交换网络是一个让旅客和其目的地城市的本地居民连接的组织..."" and ""...提供一份纸质版和/或在线版名单，将尚有空房的房东一一列出..."" This directly indicates the network provides accommodation through local hosts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 廉价航班 (Cheap flights):** While the story of the founder involves finding a cheap flight, the *network itself* doesn't provide flights.
* **C: 由当地向导提供的旅游活动 (Tour activities provided by local guides):** The passage doesn't mention any tour activities.
* **D: 与前往同一目的地的其他旅客连接 (Connection with other travelers going to the same destination):** The passage mentions recommendations *from* other travelers, but not connecting travelers *to* each other.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项关于食宿交换网络的陈述不正确？,"The correct answer is **A: 旅客总是会得到关于当地房东的推荐信息**.

Here's why:

The text states that lists *sometimes* include recommendations from other travelers (""有时会标明其他旅客的推荐和评价信息""). The word ""sometimes"" indicates that recommendations are not *always* provided.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **B: 一些网络可能需要对旅客进行额外的验证** - The text explicitly states ""尽管有些组织提供或要求额外的验证.""
*   **C: 旅客将会得到目的地城市中尚有空房的房东的列表** - The text states ""随后会提供一份纸质版和/或在线版名单，将尚有空房的房东一一列出.""
*   **D: 旅客有时可以看到对当地房东的评价** - The text states lists ""有时会标明其他旅客的推荐和评价信息.""



"
根据这段文字，哪种类型的客人最不可能出现在共享宿舍房间里？,"The correct answer is **C: 带着小孩旅行的客人 (Guests traveling with children)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that ""few families with children"" are seen at hostels, and those that *are* allowed typically stay in **private rooms**, not dorms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 二十岁出头的客人 (Guests in their twenties)** - The passage specifically states this is the *typical* customer.
* **B: 独自旅行的客人 (Solo travelers)** - Hostels are commonly used by solo travelers and nothing in the passage excludes them.
* **D: 三十五岁左右的客人 (Guests around thirty-five years old)** - The passage mentions ""relatively older people"" are sometimes seen, so this isn't unlikely.



"
根据这段文字，谁最有可能住在旅舍里？,"The correct answer is **B: 三个 22 岁的人一起旅行**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the typical customer is around 20 years old.** Three 22-year-olds fit this description perfectly.
* **Option A is incorrect:** The passage says families with children are *rare*.
* **Option C is incorrect:** While older people *can* be found at hostels, they aren't the *typical* customer.
* **Option D is incorrect:** The passage explicitly states families with children are uncommon.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项陈述准确描述了回旋镖投掷？,"The correct answer is **D: 只有一些回旋镖能够返回** (Only some boomerangs are able to return).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""实际上，澳大利亚市面上的大多数回旋镖都飞不回来。"" (In fact, most boomerangs on the market in Australia do not return.) This directly supports the idea that not all boomerangs return.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 如果正确扔出，它会始终回到你的手中** (If thrown correctly, it will always return to your hand) - The passage doesn't guarantee a return *every* time, only that suitable boomerangs *can* return.
* **B: 它在本地人中比在游客中更受欢迎** (It is more popular among locals than tourists) - The passage doesn't discuss the popularity of boomerang throwing among locals versus tourists.
* **C: 澳大利亚没有多少回旋镖可供使用** (There aren't many boomerangs available in Australia) - The passage states ""澳大利亚市面上的大多数回旋镖"" (most boomerangs on the market in Australia), which implies there *are* a lot available, but most don't return.



"
以下哪项主要用于爪哇菜？,"The correct answer is **C: 椰子糖** (Coconut Sugar).

The passage specifically states that Javanese people particularly like **""糖（尤其是爪哇椰子糖）""** (sugar, especially Javanese coconut sugar).  The other options are types of sugar, but coconut sugar is the one explicitly mentioned as a favorite in Javanese cuisine.
"
根据这段文字，传染病是如何传播的？,"The correct answer is **B: 病原体 (Pathogens)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""传染病是由包括病毒、细菌、真菌和其他寄生物在内的**病原体**引起的疾病."" (Infectious diseases are diseases caused by **pathogens** including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other parasites.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 感染者 (Infected individuals):** While infectious diseases *spread from* infected individuals, the individuals themselves aren't *how* they are transmitted – it's *what* they carry that does the transmitting.
* **C: 细菌 (Bacteria):** Bacteria are *a type* of pathogen, but not the only one. The text lists viruses, fungi, and parasites as well.
* **D: 疫苗 (Vaccines):** Vaccines *prevent* infectious diseases; they don't cause or transmit them.



"
根据这段文字，什么不是导致传染病的原因？,"The correct answer is **A: 疫苗**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""传染病是由包括病毒、细菌、真菌和其他寄生物在内的病原体引起的疾病."" (Infectious diseases are caused by pathogens including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other parasites.)
* This directly identifies viruses, bacteria, and fungi as *causes* of infectious diseases.
* **The passage also mentions:** ""各国政府要求入境游客或离境居民接种一系列疾病疫苗"" (Many governments require incoming or outgoing travelers to be vaccinated against a number of diseases).  Vaccines are a *prevention* against infectious diseases, not a cause.

Therefore, vaccines are not a cause of infectious diseases; they are used to protect against them."
在哪种情况下，选择网页代理而不是个人 VPN 提供商对用户来说是足够的？,"The correct answer is **C: 用户主要是在重新路由 http 流量**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that VPNs are better than web proxies *because* they route all internet traffic, not just HTTP.** This implies that if you *only* need to route HTTP traffic, a web proxy might suffice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 用户想要重新路由所有流量** - The passage says VPNs are better for this.
* **B: 用户关心的是尽可能规避审查和监视** - Again, the passage highlights VPNs as superior for these reasons due to encryption.
* **D: 用户的活动需要中到高水平的带宽** - The passage states VPNs *generally* offer higher bandwidth.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪种关于 VPN 和网页代理的说法是不正确的？,"The correct answer is **D: VPN 只能重新路由 http 流量**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""它们重新路由所有互联网流量，而不仅仅是超文本传送协议 (http) 内容。"" (They reroute all internet traffic, not just Hypertext Transfer Protocol (http) content.) This directly contradicts option D.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: VPN 通常比网页代理提供更高的带宽:** The passage states ""它们通常会提供更高的带宽和更优质的服务.""
* **B: 网页代理无法重新路由所有互联网流量:** The passage explains that VPNs reroute *all* traffic, implying proxies do *not*.
* **C: 网页代理与 VPN 相比具有较低的服务质量:**  This is supported by the passage’s statement about VPNs offering “更优质的服务” (better quality of service).



"
是什么让一个人可以使用其本地区以外的电话公司？,"The correct answer is **A: 通过互联网路由的呼叫 (Calls routed over the internet)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Because calls are routed over the internet, you do not have to use a phone company located where you live or travel.""  This is the core reason someone can use a phone company outside their local area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 全球电话号码 (Global phone numbers)** - While you often *need* a global number to *receive* calls from traditional phones, the global number isn't *what enables* using a different company. It's a consequence of the internet routing.
* **C: 卫星 (Satellite)** - Satellite internet is mentioned as a way to *get* internet access, but it doesn't directly allow you to use a non-local phone company. The internet routing is the key.
* **D: PSTN 电话 (PSTN phones)** - PSTN phones are the traditional phone network. The passage contrasts using them *with* the benefits of internet routing.



"
根据这段文字，为了接听某些电话可能需要做什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 购买全球号码**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...you often have to **purchase a number separately that works globally** in order to receive calls from the public switched telephone network (PSTN)."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 使用当地的电话公司** - The passage explicitly says you *don't* need a local phone company because calls are routed over the internet.
* **C: 从本地社区获取号码** - The passage states obtaining a local number isn't required; you can have a number from a different location.
* **D: 购买 PSTN 电话** -  The passage mentions PSTN calls *coming in* but doesn't require you to *have* a PSTN phone. It's about receiving calls *from* the PSTN.



"
以下哪项对意大利语单词发音的描述是不准确的？,"The correct answer is **D: 大多数单词的发音是根据以下元音变化的**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the *main letters* to pay attention to (c and g) have pronunciation changes *based on following vowels*. It doesn't say that *most* words change pronunciation based on vowels. It says most words have a direct correspondence between spelling and pronunciation, *except* for those with c and g.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the passage:

*   **A: 两个 r 的发音与一个 r 的发音不同** - The passage directly states this with the examples of ""caro"" and ""carro"".
*   **B: 大多数单词的发音与拼写相同** - The passage begins by stating this.
*   **C: 具有字母 c 和 g 的单词可能有些棘手** - The passage explicitly says these are the ""main letters to pay attention to"" due to their variable pronunciation.



"
伊兹密尔的以下哪些特征起源于现代之前？,"The correct answer is **D: 红瓦屋顶 (Red tile roofs)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""In between the broad boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping malls are scattered traditional red-tiled roofs..."" This directly links red tile roofs to the city's past, existing *before* the modern developments.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 宽阔的林荫大道 (Broad boulevards):**  The passage contrasts these *with* older features, implying they are modern.
* **B: 玻璃外墙的建筑 (Glass-fronted buildings):** Clearly a characteristic of a modern, developed city.
* **C: 购物中心 (Shopping malls):**  Also explicitly described as modern.

The passage also mentions Izmir was once Smyrna, an ancient city, which further supports that red tile roofs would be a feature originating from a time before modernization.



"
以下哪项不是伊兹密尔的准确特征？,"The correct answer is **B: 其氛围反映了传统的土耳其**.

The passage specifically states: ""however the city has more of a Mediterranean European feel than traditional Turkey."" This means its atmosphere *doesn't* reflect traditional Turkish culture.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: 该城市环绕着一个大海湾** - The text says it's ""surrounded by a large gulf and mountains.""
* **C: 你可以找到现代化的购物中心和古老的教堂** - The text mentions ""modern shopping malls"" and ""ancient mosques and churches.""
* **D: 它是土耳其第二大港口** - The text directly states it's ""Turkey’s second largest port after Istanbul.""



"
“花见”一词指的是观赏什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 樱花**.

The passage states ""赏樱，亦称“花见”（hanami）..."" which directly translates to ""cherry blossom viewing, also known as 'hanami'..."" Therefore, ""hanami"" refers to viewing cherry blossoms (sakura).
"
谁主持了第一次观赏樱花派对？,"The correct answer is **C: 日本的天皇** (The Emperor of Japan).

The passage states: ""In Japan, the earliest cherry blossom parties were hosted by the Emperor for himself and other aristocratic members of the imperial family in the Imperial Palace.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 中国的皇帝** (The Emperor of China) - The passage says the *concept* came from China, but the parties themselves were started by the Japanese Emperor.
* **B: 日本的贵族** (Japanese Aristocrats) - While aristocrats *attended* the first parties, the Emperor *hosted* them.
* **D: 中国的贵族** (Chinese Aristocrats) - The passage doesn't mention Chinese aristocrats participating in Japanese cherry blossom viewing.



"
根据这段文字，哪一项是最不可能吸引游客前往耶路撒冷的原因？,"The correct answer is **B: 它是以色列的首都**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states** that most other countries and the United Nations *do not* recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. This means being the capital is a politically sensitive issue, not a universally appealing tourist attraction.
* **The passage highlights** the city's religious significance (A), cultural attractions (C), and historical sites (D) as *key reasons* why it's a major tourist destination.  These are directly presented as draws for visitors.

Therefore, being the capital—a point of contention rather than widespread agreement—is the least likely reason to attract tourists based on the information provided.



"
这段文字中没有提到以下哪项是耶路撒冷的著名之处？,"The correct answer is **B: 政治影响**.

Here's why:

* **引人入胜的历史 (A):** The passage explicitly states Jerusalem has ""an engaging history stretching back millennia.""
* **宗教意义 (C):** The passage highlights Jerusalem as a holy city for three major religions and a ""spiritual, religious and cultural center.""
* **文化景点 (D):** The passage mentions ""numerous historical, archaeological, and cultural sites"" as well as ""vibrant, bustling shopping centers, cafes, and restaurants.""
* **政治影响 (B):** While the passage *mentions* the political dispute over Jerusalem's status as Israel's capital, it doesn't elaborate on its broader political *influence*. The focus is on its history, religion, and tourism.

Therefore, political influence is the one aspect of Jerusalem's fame not detailed in the text."
根据这段文字，哪一类旅行者不会从购买万能卡中受益？,"The correct answer is **B: 只参观克鲁格国家公园的旅行者**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""带着这张卡，你可以进入南非的一些公园或全部的国家公园."" and ""与所有南非国家公园一样，该公园每天都收取养护费和门票费.""
* **A Wild Card benefits those who visit *multiple* parks.** If someone *only* visits Kruger National Park, the cost of the Wild Card might be higher than simply paying the daily conservation/entry fees for Kruger alone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The text clearly implies the Wild Card is *for* people who want to visit many parks.
* **C:** The Wild Card is described as a benefit, implying it helps save money for those concerned with fees.
* **D:** This is a good use case for the Wild Card – visiting multiple parks would make the card worthwhile.



"
哪项陈述没有准确描述克鲁格国家公园？,"The correct answer is **C: 它是南非国家公园中最小的**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""公园占地 19500 平方公里..."" (The park covers 19,500 square kilometers...) This indicates it's a *large* park, not a small one.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: 它被认为是南非的一个主要景点** - The passage says ""它是南非的主要景点之一"" (It is one of South Africa's main attractions).
* **B: 公园内的野生动植物随着生态区的不同而有所不同** - The passage states it's divided into 14 ""不同的生态区，为不同的野生动植物提供支持"" (different ecological zones that support a variety of flora and fauna).
* **D: 通过购买万能卡，游客可以进入公园** - The passage says ""带着这张卡，你可以进入南非的一些公园或全部的国家公园"" (With this card, you can enter some or all of the national parks in South Africa).



"
在山的更陡峭部分，哪一项最有可能对攀登者构成危险？,"The correct answer is **A: 潮湿的条件**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...particularly when the weather is wet, conditions can quickly become dangerous."" This directly links wet/潮湿 conditions to increased risk on the steep parts of the trail.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: 石阶 (Stone steps):** While the trail is steep, the steps *aid* in the climb. The passage says most of the trail *is* stone steps.
* **C: 小洞 (Small hole):** The passage mentions needing to crawl through a small hole, but doesn't say it's inherently dangerous, just that it's low and narrow.
* **D: 钢缆 (Steel cables):** The steel cables are *provided* as support and to help prevent falls – they are a safety feature, not a danger.



"
以下哪一项陈述没有准确地反映文章中描述的马丘比丘山的上坡路？,"The correct answer is **B: In the steeper sections there are no handrails.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""In the steeper sections there are steel cables acting as handholds."" This directly contradicts option B.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

* **A: Even fit climbers may find themselves breathless.** - The passage says it's ""said to be breathtaking,"" implying exertion and shortness of breath.
* **C: You must pass through a low, narrow hole near the top.** - The passage states, ""You must squeeze through a very low, narrow opening near the top.""
* **D: The steeper sections can become dangerous when wet.** - The passage warns, ""Be careful on the steep parts, especially when wet, as conditions can quickly become hazardous.""

Therefore, option B is the only statement *not* accurately reflected in the text.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不是马略卡岛美食的主要特色？,"The correct answer is **C: 谷物 (Grains)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** 马略卡岛的菜肴主要以面包、蔬菜和肉类为基础 (Mallorca cuisine is based mainly on bread, vegetables, and meat...).
* It specifically mentions bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) as foundations of the cuisine.
* It *doesn't* mention grains generally, only bread which is a product *made from* grains, but not grains themselves as a core component.

Therefore, grains are not highlighted as a main characteristic of Mallorcan cuisine in this text.
"
根据这段文字提供的信息，哪项关于 hangi 餐的描述是不正确的？,"The correct answer is **A: 地热窑烤利用用火烧过的石头加热坑洞**.

Here's why:

The text states that *some* hangi use stones heated by fire, while *others* use geothermal heat to naturally warm the ground. It doesn't say all geothermal hangi use fire-heated stones.  Therefore, stating that geothermal hangi *utilizes* fire-heated stones is inaccurate based on the provided text.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: 使用热石的 hangi 可在惠灵顿找到** - The text says hangi (in various forms) can be found in Wellington.
* **C: 烤肉大餐经常使用 hangi 烹制** - The text specifically states ""Stone ovens are often used to cook traditional roast meals.""
* **D: 在罗托鲁瓦可以找到地热窑烤** - The text explicitly mentions Rotorua as a place to find geothermal hangi.



"
以下哪项未被提及作为加热 hangi 坑洞的典型方式？,"The correct answer is **A: 煤气 (Gas)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:**
    * ""坑洞通过用火烧过的石头加热"" (Pit holes are heated by fire-heated stones) - this refers to hot stones.
    * ""在某些地方则是利用地热使地面自然变热"" (In some places, geothermal heat is used to naturally heat the ground) - this refers to geothermal heat.

* **The options:**
    * **A: 煤气 (Gas)** - This is *not* mentioned in the passage as a method for heating a hangi.
    * **B: 热石 (Hot stones)** - Clearly stated in the passage.
    * **C: 地热 (Geothermal)** - Clearly stated in the passage.
    * **D: 热石 (Hot stones)** -  A duplicate of B, also stated in the passage.

Therefore, gas is the only option not mentioned as a way to heat a hangi pit."
什么可能导致来自一位修道士或修女的特别认可？,"The correct answer is **A: 穿着色彩鲜艳的裹身衣**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...if you bring your own, *especially* a brightly colored one, the monks at the gate will give you a knowing smirk."" A smirk suggests a subtle acknowledgment or approval.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 遮盖肩膀** - Covering shoulders is a requirement, not something that earns special recognition.
*   **C: 从修道院借用一件裹身衣** - The passage implies the borrowed clothes aren't comfortable, suggesting it's not a preferred choice and wouldn't lead to approval.
*   **D: 穿着没有及膝的裙子** - This would violate the rules and likely *not* receive approval.



"
以下哪种服装不太可能从修道院借用？ ,"The correct answer is **B: 短裤**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states men must wear long pants and can borrow them if needed.
*   It states women must wear skirts that cover the knees and can borrow wraps if needed.
*   It *doesn't* mention borrowing shorts. In fact, it specifically states men need **long** pants, making shorts unsuitable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 裙子** - The passage states wraps *are* available for women, implying skirts are borrowed.
*   **C: 长裤** - The passage explicitly says men can borrow long pants.
*   **D: 裹身衣** - The passage says wraps are provided for women who don't have appropriate clothing.



"
游客在访问南极地区时什么时候最有机会看到星星？,"The correct answer is **C: 冬季月份**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""If you travel to the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience polar night, a period when the sun does not rise above the horizon...the sky will be dark for most of the day."" This darkness is key for seeing stars.
* **Options A, B, and D are true statements, but not the *best* answer based on the passage.** While summer months *might* have some stargazing opportunities, the passage specifically highlights winter for maximizing the chance due to the polar night.  Population density and light pollution are mentioned as benefits, but the *time of year* is the primary factor discussed for star visibility.

Therefore, the passage directly links winter months to the best chance of seeing stars in the Antarctic (and Arctic) due to the extended darkness.
"
卫星电话何时不能替代移动电话？,"The correct answer is **A: If satellite signal is not clear**. 

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...satellite phones cannot replace mobile phones because calls can only be made outdoors with a clear satellite signal."" This directly addresses when a satellite phone *cannot* function as a replacement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: If location is too remote** - The passage *states* remote locations are *where* satellite phones are useful.
* **C: If it will be used outdoors** - The passage states outdoor use is *required* for satellite phones.
* **D: If the adventure requires certain data needs** - While the passage mentions data needs, it doesn't say this is a reason a satellite phone *can't* replace a mobile phone; it just notes satellite phones are *used* for these needs.



"
卫星电话何时比移动电话更可取？,"The correct answer is **B: 进行游船旅行期间 (During a yachting trip)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""该服务经常用于航运，包括游艇以及有远程数据和语音需求的探险."" (This service is often used in shipping, including yachts, as well as expeditions with remote data and voice needs.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 在城市度假期间 (During a city vacation):** Mobile phone coverage is generally good in cities.
* **C: 不需要远程数据时 (When remote data is not needed):** The passage specifically mentions satellite phones are useful *with* remote data needs.
* **D: 预计有足够的手机信号覆盖时 (When sufficient mobile phone coverage is expected):** Satellite phones are a backup when mobile coverage *isn't* available.



"
以下哪种冲突导致了德涅斯特河沿岸共和国的创立？,"The correct answer is **B: 民族 (Ethnic)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""摩尔多瓦是一个多民族共和国，饱受民族冲突之苦。1994 年，这场冲突导致摩尔多瓦东部自诩为德涅斯特河沿岸共和国的成立。"" (Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic, suffering from ethnic conflicts. In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 经济 (Economic):** While economic connections were *rebuilt* after the conflict, the conflict itself wasn't *caused* by economic issues, according to the text.
*   **C: 语言 (Language):** The passage mentions language differences (Romanian and Russian), but doesn't state this *caused* the conflict.
*   **D: 宗教 (Religion):** The passage mentions religion (Orthodoxy) but doesn't link it to the conflict."
德涅斯特河沿岸共和国与摩尔多瓦其他地区的哪个方面不同？  ,"The correct answer is **C: 联合国认可 (United Nations recognition)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Transnistrian Republic (德涅斯特河沿岸共和国) ""has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state."" This directly highlights the difference between Transnistria and the rest of Moldova – its lack of international recognition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 语言 (Language):** The passage states Romanian is the official language of Moldova, and Russian is widely used – it doesn't say Transnistria uses a different language.
* **B: 宗教 (Religion):** The passage says Eastern Orthodox is the main religion of *Moldova* generally, but doesn't indicate a difference in religion within Transnistria.
* **D: 货币 (Currency):** The passage states Transnistria *has* its own currency, but doesn't say Moldova doesn't have a currency of its own. The fact they both have currencies isn’t a *difference* between them.

根据这段文字，如果旅行者希望避免多风天气，他们应该何时访问蒙得维的亚？,"The correct answer is **C: 北半球的夏季月份**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""当风和湿度结合在一起，会让人感觉比温度计显示的温度要冷.""  This means windy conditions make it *feel* colder.
* **The text also states:** ""蒙得维的亚位于赤道以南，因此北半球冬天的时候，那里是夏天，反之亦然.""

Therefore, to avoid wind (which makes it feel colder), a traveler should visit when it's summer in Montevideo, which corresponds to the **North Hemisphere's winter months**.  However, the question asks about *avoiding* wind, and the text implies wind is more of a factor when it *feels* colder. Since it's hotter in the Montevideo summer (North Hemisphere Winter), wind will be less of a concern for feeling cold.  The opposite is true – in Montevideo's winter (North Hemisphere summer), the wind makes it feel colder.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 北半球的冬季月份:** This is when it's summer in Montevideo, but potentially windier and colder *feeling* due to wind chill.
* **B: 蒙得维的亚的旱季:** The text says there *isn't* a specific dry season.
* **D: 蒙得维的亚的冬季月份:** This is when it's winter in Montevideo, and the text specifically says wind and humidity make it feel colder than the actual temperature.



"
根据这段文字，如果旅行者偏爱凉爽的气候，他们应该何时访问蒙得维的亚？,"The correct answer is **D: 北半球冬季时**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""蒙得维的亚位于赤道以南，因此北半球冬天的时候，那里是夏天，反之亦然。"" (Montevideo is south of the equator, therefore when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.)
* **The question asks:** When should a traveler visit if they prefer *cool* weather?
* **Therefore:** If they prefer cool weather, they should visit when it's winter in Montevideo (which is the same time as summer in the Northern Hemisphere). However, the question asks for when to visit to get a cool climate, which would be when it's the opposite season - the Northern Hemisphere's winter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 蒙得维的亚夏季时** (During Montevideo's summer) - The text says summers are often over 30°C, which is *hot*, not cool.
* **B: 北半球夏季时** (During the Northern Hemisphere's summer) - This would be winter in Montevideo, so it's hot.
* **C: 蒙得维的亚雨季时** (During Montevideo's rainy season) - The text specifically says there isn't a distinct rainy season.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项与知名涂鸦艺术家有关，而非故意破坏？,"The correct answer is **A: 涂鸦活动**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""如今已经有了成熟的涂鸦艺术家、涂鸦活动和‘合法’涂鸦墙."" This directly links ""涂鸦活动"" (graffiti events) with established artists and implies they are done in a legitimate, non-destructive context.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 乱写乱涂 (random scribbles/defacement):** The passage explicitly contrasts this with the work of mature artists.
* **C: 公共财产上不受欢迎的壁画 (unwanted murals on public property):**  The passage initially associates graffiti with vandalism of public *and private* property.
* **D: 难以辨认的标签 (indiscernible tags):** The passage states that work by established artists is *more* like art and *less* like these tags.



"
音乐节的哪个方面被一些参与者认为是体验的重要部分？,"The correct answer is **B: 在现场露营 (Camping on site)**.

The passage states: ""绝大多数参加者选择在现场露营，而且大部分参加者认为这是音乐节体验极为重要的一部分。"" (The vast majority of attendees choose to camp on site, and most consider it an extremely important part of the festival experience.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 带着小孩子来 (Bringing children)** - The passage only mentions special camping areas *for* families with children, not that bringing children is a key part of the experience for *most* attendees.
*   **C: 演奏音乐到深夜 (Playing music late into the night)** - While the passage mentions music playing late, it doesn't say this is considered a crucial part of the experience by most.
*   **D: 早点到 (Arriving early)** - Arriving early is mentioned as a tactic to get a good campsite, but not as an essential part of the festival experience itself.



"
根据这段文字，如果一个音乐节的参与者想要在靠近音乐的地方露营，他们应该优先考虑什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 早点到** (arrive early).

The passage explicitly states: ""If you want to see the performances up close, you need to arrive early and secure a spot near the stage."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 晚上很晚才去** (go late at night) - The text says to arrive *early*, not late.
* **B: 待在一个家庭区** (stay in a family area) - This is an option for families with children, but doesn't relate to proximity to the music.
* **C: 在场外露营** (camp off-site) - The text focuses on *on-site* camping and being near the stage.



"
根据这段文字，在寻找新墨西哥州北部夜生活时，游客应该避开哪里？,"The correct answer is **B: 小镇酒吧 (Small town bars)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Note: For visitors from out of state, the small town bars are not always good places to hang out."" and goes on to explain the dangers of drunk driving around them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 普韦布洛人 (Pueblo people):** The text mentions their remoteness and needing to travel to cities for nightlife, but doesn't suggest avoiding them.
* **C: 商场 (Malls):** Malls aren't mentioned in the context of nightlife.
* **D: 赌场 (Casinos):** The text actually states casinos *offer* entertainment and drinks.



"
根据这段文字，在新墨西哥州北部，游客在哪里最有可能找到知名的娱乐活动？,"The correct answer is **C: 在圣达菲附近的赌场**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...其中一些赌场还提供知名的娱乐活动（主要是紧邻阿尔伯克基和圣达菲的大型赌场）。"" This directly links known entertainment to casinos *near* Albuquerque and Santa Fe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 在离阿尔伯克基两个小时路程的赌场:** While casinos near Albuquerque *exist*, the passage specifically mentions entertainment being near *both* Albuquerque *and* Santa Fe.  The ""two hours"" is not information provided in the text.
* **B: 在偏远的普韦布洛:** The passage says people have to travel *to* Albuquerque or Santa Fe for nightlife, implying Pueblos don't have it.
* **D: 在小镇酒吧:** The passage specifically warns against these for tourists due to drunk driving risks, and doesn't mention entertainment.



"
预算有限的旅行者可能要避开哪种饮料？,"The correct answer is **D: 果汁**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""果汁价格昂贵，但品质很好."" (Juice is expensive, but of good quality). For a budget traveler, expensive drinks are something to avoid.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 澳大利亚葡萄酒** - The passage says Australian wines *travel* well, implying they are available, not that they are expensive.
*   **B: 瓶装水** - The passage says bottled water is *easily* available if you're concerned about tap water, implying it's not a luxury.
*   **C: 本地啤酒** - The passage describes the local beer as ""很好喝、很清爽"" (good to drink, very refreshing) and doesn't mention it being expensive."
根据这段文字所述的地区，以下哪种饮料订单可能会让服务员感到困惑？,"The correct answer is **D: 一份“馥芮白”咖啡**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that ""the concept of a 'flat white' coffee is still quite foreign to Australians."" This means ordering a flat white would likely confuse a server in this location, as it's not a common drink there.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 一小杯黑咖啡** - The passage states a small black coffee is known as an ""espresso.""
*   **B: 一杯“一号”啤酒** - ""Número Uno"" beer is mentioned as the local main beer.
*   **C: 一瓶新西兰的苏维翁白葡萄酒** - New Zealand wines are noted as being well-suited for travel to this location and available for purchase.



"
持续三个世纪的殖民时期是由哪个群体开启的？,"The correct answer is **D: 西班牙人** (Spanish).

The text states: ""西班牙人开始了长达三个世纪的殖民时期."" (The Spanish began a colonial period lasting three centuries.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 帕亚瓜** (Payagua) - They were an indigenous group living in the Chaco region, not colonizers.
*   **B: 瓜伊库鲁** (Guaycuru) - They were an indigenous group living in the Chaco region, not colonizers.
*   **C: 瓜拉尼人** (Guaraní) - They were the primary indigenous group in the region *before* colonization.



"
根据这段文字，让巴黎人对你产生好感的最佳方式是什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 表现得有礼貌 (Behave politely)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""If you show a little basic politeness, the Parisian rudeness quickly disappears."" This directly indicates that politeness is the key to a positive interaction with Parisians.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 试图模仿巴黎人的态度 (Try to imitate Parisian attitudes)** - The passage actually suggests the stereotype of Parisians *is* negative (self-centered, rude, arrogant), so imitating that wouldn't be beneficial.
*   **B: 散发自信 (Exude confidence)** - While confidence isn't bad, the passage doesn't mention it as a way to win Parisians over.
*   **D: 展示外向的行为 (Display outgoing behavior)** - Similar to confidence, outgoing behavior isn't highlighted as important in the text.

"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不被认为是巴黎人的刻板印象特质？,"The correct answer is **C: 活泼 (lively)**.

The passage specifically states Parisians are stereotyped as being ""self-centered, rude, and arrogant."" While ""rude"" and ""arrogant"" are directly mentioned (and ""唐突"" - tangtu - translates to abrupt/blunt, which is similar to rude), ""活泼"" (lively) is *not* presented as a characteristic of this stereotype. 

Therefore, it's the option that doesn't fit the description in the text."
开普敦 MetroRail 头等舱的好处是什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 没有那么多人**.

Here's why:

* The text specifically states ""MetroPlus is more comfortable and **less crowded**..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 车厢在火车的前面** - While the text says MetroPlus is at the Cape Town end of the train, it doesn't specifically say it's *always* the front.
* **C: 比三等舱便宜** - The text states it's *slightly more expensive* than Metro.
* **D: 与地铁车票价格相同** - The text says it's cheaper than typical European metro tickets, not the same price.



"
根据这段文字，开普敦的每辆通勤火车都有什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 头等和三等车厢**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""每列火车都有 MetroPlus 和 Metro 车厢"" (Every train has both MetroPlus and Metro carriages).  MetroPlus is described as ""头等舱"" (first class) and Metro as ""三等舱"" (third class).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 一个不那么拥挤的 Metro 车厢 (One less crowded Metro carriage):** While MetroPlus *is* less crowded, the passage doesn't say there's a Metro carriage specifically designed to be less crowded.
* **B: 两个等级的票价相同 (The two classes have the same ticket price):** The passage says MetroPlus is ""稍微贵了一点"" (slightly more expensive).
* **C: 三个不同等级 (Three different classes):** The passage only mentions two classes: MetroPlus and Metro.



"
以下哪项是害虫不太可能做的事情？,"The correct answer is **D: 造成强烈的伤害**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""传染性疾病本身，或那些能通过暴力杀伤人类的危险动物，通常不属于害虫之列."" (Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can violently injure humans, are generally not considered pests.)

This directly tells us that *causing severe injury* is something pests are *not* typically known for.  The other options (rashes, allergic reactions, spreading disease) are all mentioned as things pests *can* do.
"
预付费电话卡可以在哪里购买？,"The correct answer is **C: 街头小店 (Street stalls)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""每个街头小店都摆满了一排令人眼花缭乱的预付费电话卡..."" (Every street stall is filled with a dazzling array of prepaid phone cards...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 特定国家 (Specific countries)** - The passage mentions special offers *to* specific countries, not where the cards are *bought*.
* **B: 火车站 (Train stations)** - The passage doesn't mention train stations.
* **D: 付费电话机 (Payphones)** - The passage says the cards *can be used* with payphones, but not that you buy them *at* payphones.
"
一些电话卡提供的更好的通话费率是如何使用的？,"The correct answer is **B: Through free phone numbers**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...some cards have special offers when calling certain countries...usually accessed by dialing a number, and most calls to that number are free."" This directly explains how the better rates are used – by dialing a free phone number *before* making the international call.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: They can only be used in specific countries:** The passage states they have special offers *when calling* certain countries, not that they *only* work in those countries.
* **C: In street stalls:** Where you *buy* the cards is irrelevant to *how* the better rates are used.
* **D: Using payphones and paying extra:** The passage implies the special rates are *instead of* regular costs, not an addition to them.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪种树在普利特维茨湖国家公园中不太常见？,"The correct answer is **B: 橡树**.

The passage specifically mentions beech, spruce, and fir as the *main* tree species in Plitvice Lakes National Park. It doesn't mention oak at all. Therefore, oak is the least common tree listed, and thus the answer.
"
下列哪种稀有动物可以在普利特维茨湖国家公园中发现？,"The correct answer is **D: 松鸡**.

The text specifically states: ""In there you can see rare animals such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and **capercaillie** (松鸡) and many more common species.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 火鸡** - Not mentioned in the text.
*   **B: 蜜獾** - Not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: 食火鸡** - Not mentioned in the text.



"
根据这段文字，区域码实际上有助于什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 市场控制**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""the actual purpose is to allow these companies to better control their markets; it's all about making money."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 磁盘复制 (Disk Copying):** The text says region codes *don't* affect copying; a copied disk plays fine on any compatible device.
* **C: 防止盗版 (Preventing Piracy):** The passage directly claims region codes are a false justification and *don't* prevent piracy.
* **D: 非法复制 (Illegal Copying):** Region codes don't *help* illegal copying; they're presented as a failed attempt to *stop* it.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项是媒体公司编造的有关区域码的谎言？,"The correct answer is **B: They help avoid illegal copying**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**In fact, region codes do nothing to prevent illegal duplication; a bit-for-bit copy of a disc will play on any device that can play the original.**"" This directly contradicts the claim that region codes are for preventing piracy/illegal copying.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: They are necessary to gain more market control** - The passage *states* this is the *actual* purpose, not a lie.
*   **C: They are useful for making money** - The passage *states* this is the *actual* purpose, not a lie.
*   **D: They rarely help prevent piracy** - While true according to the passage, the passage presents the claim that they *do* help prevent piracy as the lie, not simply that they are ineffective.



"
回到本国时，哪个程序通常是非正式的？,"The correct answer is **A: 入境检查 (Entry check)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...in returning to your country you usually don't need to go through immigration or it's just a formality...""  This directly refers to entry/immigration checks being less rigorous or just for show.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 申报物件 (Declaring items):** The passage specifically says you *must* declare items exceeding legal limits, implying it's a serious process, not a formality.
* **C: 物件的法定限额 (Legal limits of items):** This is the *rule* you need to follow, not a process itself.
* **D: 海关管制 (Customs control):** The passage says customs *can be* troublesome, which is the opposite of a formality.



"
在到达你的本国之前，以下哪些是你应该了解的？,"The best answer is **B: 是否需要申报超过法定限额的物件** and **D: 你携带的任何物件是否不允许入境**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""确保知晓可以携带什么，不能携带什么，并申报任何超出法律允许的物件。"" (Make sure you know what you can carry, what you can't carry, and declare anything exceeding legal limits.)

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **A: 是否会有入境检查站 (Will there be immigration checkpoints?)** - The passage says these are *usually* not needed or are just formalities, so knowing *if* they exist isn't the main concern.
* **C: 是否会进行海关管制 (Will there be customs control?)** - The passage says customs *can* be difficult, but the important thing isn't *if* it happens, but being prepared for it.

**Therefore, understanding what you need to declare and what is prohibited is the most crucial information from the passage.** Both B and D relate directly to this point."
根据这段文字，科茶莫山谷内丰富的什么使得登山者能够不断地发现新路线？,"The correct answer is **D: 峭壁 (Qiàobì - Cliffs)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""来自世界各地的登山者在其**绵延不断可作为攀援墙的峭壁**上不断开拓新路线。"" (Climbers from all over the world are constantly developing new routes on its **endless cliffs that can serve as climbing walls**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 景色 (Jǐngsè - Scenery):** While the scenery is stunning, it doesn't *enable* new routes to be created.
* **B: 山峰 (Shānfēng - Peaks):** The peaks offer great views, but the *climbing* happens on the cliffs.
* **C: 峰顶 (Fēngdǐng - Summits):** Similar to peaks, the summits are the result of climbing, not the reason new routes are possible.



"
根据这段文字提供的信息，谁涵盖了南半球最多的航线？,"The correct answer is **B: 星空联盟**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""星空联盟涵盖了全球各条航线..."" This means it covers the most routes overall, and specifically within the Southern Hemisphere, despite one missing route. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 天合联盟:** The text explicitly states 天合联盟 doesn't even have transoceanic routes.
* **C: 南太平洋:** This is a *location*, not an airline or alliance.
* **D: 南美航空寰宇一家:** While they operate a key route, the text frames it as an exception and doesn't suggest they cover the *most* routes.



"
哪个航空联盟在南半球涵盖的跨洋航线最少？,"The correct answer is **D: 天合联盟**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states, ""天合联盟甚至没有跨洋航线."" This directly answers the question of which alliance has the fewest transoceanic routes in the Southern Hemisphere – none at all!

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 星空联盟** - The passage states Star Alliance *covers* global routes, although it has a gap in the South Pacific. This means it has *more* routes than 天合联盟.
*   **B: 南太平洋** - The South Pacific is a *location*, not an airline alliance.
*   **C: 南美航空寰宇一家** - The passage mentions LATAM (part of Oneworld) has a specific route, implying they have *some* routes, not the fewest.



"
哪个旅游组织接替了全球跑步之旅？,"The correct answer is **B: Go Running Tours**.

The passage states: ""Global Running Tours 的接替者 Go Running Tours..."" which directly translates to ""The successor to Global Running Tours is Go Running Tours.""
"
根据这段文字，Go Running Tours 帮助连接多少个不同的跑步旅游组织？,"The correct answer is **C: 几十个**.

Here's why:

The text states that Go Running Tours connects ""数十个观光跑运营商"" (dozens of sightseeing running operators) across four continents. ""数十个"" directly translates to ""dozens"", meaning a number between 10 and 99. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 四个 (Four):** While the text mentions Barcelona, Copenhagen, and Prague as initial groups, it then states *others* joined, implying more than just those three.
* **B: 200 个 (200):** The text says there are *nearly 200* running tour organizations *globally*, but Go Running Tours doesn't connect all of them – it connects a *subset* of those.
* **D: 三个 (Three):**  As with option A, this only accounts for the initially mentioned cities and ignores the expansion of the organization.



"
如果游客希望尽可能清晰地看到猎豹，应该怎么做？,"The correct answer is **C: 使用双筒望远镜 (Use binoculars)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""狮子、猎豹和花豹有时很怕人，用双筒望远镜你能看得更清楚。"" (Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes afraid of people, and binoculars will allow you to see them more clearly.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 进行徒步游猎 (Go on a walking safari):** The passage states cheetahs are *afraid* of people, making a close-up walking safari less likely to result in a good view.
* **B: 参加丛林漫步 (Participate in a jungle walk):**  This is just another term for a walking safari, and suffers from the same problem as option A.
* **D: 坐车并使用标准设备 (Travel by car and use standard equipment):** While this is a good way to see many animals, the passage specifically says binoculars are better for seeing cheetahs because they are shy.



"
根据这段文字，在汽车游猎活动中，游客可能会遇到哪种动物？,"The correct answer is **B: 长颈鹿 (Giraffe)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""一些动物（例如大象和长颈鹿）往往喜欢挨近汽车，而标准的设备可以让人更好地欣赏。"" (Some animals (such as elephants and giraffes) often like to approach cars, and standard equipment allows for better viewing.)

While lions, cheetahs, and leopards are *mentioned* in the text, it specifically says they are often *afraid* of people and best viewed with binoculars.  The text explicitly states giraffes are likely to approach cars.

Therefore, a giraffe is the animal you are most likely to encounter during a car safari according to the passage.



"
根据这段文字，哪种方式可以降低旅游成本？,"The correct answer is **B: 找到一个四人组 (Find a group of four)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""如果你独自一人或只有一个朋友同行，不妨试着认识其他人，组建 4 到 6 人的旅行团，这样可以获得更优惠的人均价格。"" (If you are traveling alone or with only one friend, try to meet others and form a group of 4 to 6 people, this can get a more favorable per capita price.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 独自旅行 (Traveling alone)** - The text suggests this is *more* expensive.
*   **C: 和另一个人同行 (Traveling with another person)** - While better than solo, the text says you need to build a group *larger* than two to get discounts.
*   **D: 找到 6 人或更多的人组成的团队 (Find a team of 6 or more)** - While larger groups might also be cheaper, the text specifically highlights the benefit of forming a 4-6 person group.



"
根据这段文字，谁可能会获得最优的旅游价格？,"The correct answer is **D: 五人组 (A group of five)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""如果你独自一人或只有一个朋友同行，不妨试着认识其他人，组建 4 到 6 人的旅行团，这样可以获得更优惠的人均价格。"" (If you are traveling alone or with only one friend, you might try to meet others and form a group of 4 to 6 people, which can get you a better per-person price.)
* A group of five falls directly within that recommended range (4-6 people) for cheaper rates.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 愿意变换车辆的游客 (Tourists willing to change vehicles):** The passage warns that frequent vehicle changes are often a deceptive practice to *increase* costs, not lower them.
* **B: 三人组 (A group of three):** While better than traveling alone, it's below the 4-6 person range suggested for optimal pricing.
* **C: 两个朋友一起旅行 (Two friends traveling together):** The passage specifically suggests *adding* people to this group to get a better price.



"
根据这段文字，是什么促成了旧金山的世界知名度？,"The correct answer is **A: 在各种艺术和媒体形式中频繁出现 (Frequent appearances in various art and media forms)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""It frequently appears in music, film, literature, and popular culture, making the city and its landmarks world-famous."" This directly links the city's fame to its presence in these cultural outlets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 一流的会议场所 (First-class conference venues):** While mentioned, these contribute to the *infrastructure* supporting tourism, not the reason for the city's global recognition.
* **C: 经济多样性 (Economic diversity):**  The passage notes the diversity, but doesn't say it *causes* the world fame.
* **D: 新兴的亚洲美食 (Emerging Asian cuisine):**  This is a positive attribute of the city, but doesn't explain its worldwide renown.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪种关于旧金山的说法不正确？,"The correct answer is **D: 经济完全依赖于旅游业**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that while tourism *is* a part of San Francisco's economy, it is **diversified**. It lists other major employment sectors like professional services, government, and finance.  Therefore, saying the economy *completely* relies on tourism is inaccurate according to the text.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: 它经常出现在电影和书籍中** - The passage states it ""frequently appears in music, movies, literature, and popular culture.""
* **B: 亚洲美食很盛行** - The passage says it's a good place to find Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese cuisine (among others).
* **C: 有很多酒店和会议中心** - The passage mentions a ""large tourism infrastructure, featuring a number of hotels, restaurants, and first-class meeting facilities.""



"
根据这段文字提供的信息，哪种类型的旅行者不太可能从旅行社的服务中受益？,"The correct answer is **B: 一个爱突发奇想的旅行者 (A traveler who likes to be spontaneous)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""If you need to make any changes or have any requests, you should first go through the travel agent, rather than contacting the hotel directly."" This implies that changing plans through a travel agent isn't as quick or easy as making decisions on the fly. A spontaneous traveler who likes to change their plans frequently would find this restrictive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 一个优柔寡断的旅行者 (An indecisive traveler):** The passage specifically says travel agents can *hold* reservations while you consider the price, making them helpful for indecisive travelers.
* **C: 一个还没有获得签证的旅行者 (A traveler who hasn't obtained a visa yet):** The passage states agents can help with situations requiring additional documentation like visas.
* **D: 一个喜欢预订套餐的旅行者 (A traveler who likes booking packages):** The passage explicitly mentions travel agents often offer packages including breakfast, airport transfers, and even flights/hotels.



"
这段文字中没有提到以下哪项是通过旅行社预订的好处？,"The correct answer is **A: 快速获得旅行证件 (Quickly obtaining travel documents)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Travel agents can *help you* if you need time to acquire documents like visas, but it doesn't say they *quickly obtain* them *for* you. It just says they can hold the booking while you get them yourself.
* **The passage states:**
    * **B: 酒店优惠 (Hotel discounts)** - They work with specific hotels and offer deals.
    * **C: 一揽子套餐 (Package deals)** - They offer packages including breakfast, transfers, and flights/hotels.
    * **D: 保留预订 (Holding reservations)** - They can hold reservations for you while you consider prices or obtain documents.

Therefore, the only benefit *not* mentioned in the text is quickly getting travel documents.



"
根据这段文字，实时文本翻译应用不能做到什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 100% 准确地翻译**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...they still *can* completely translate incorrectly."" This means the applications are not always accurate and cannot guarantee a 100% accurate translation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 翻译外语标志** - The passage states the apps *can* translate text on signs.
*   **B: 翻译整段文字** - The passage defines the apps as being able to translate ""whole passages of text"".
*   **C: 通过智能手机翻译物体上的文字** - The passage states some apps allow you to point your smartphone at objects to translate text.

是什么让翻译可以在离线状态下进行？,"The correct answer is **C: 下载语言数据**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""在下载所需语言数据后，它可以进行离线翻译."" (After downloading the required language data, it can perform offline translation.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 改进的翻译引擎 (Improved translation engine):** While important for *quality* of translation, the engine itself doesn't enable offline use.
*   **B: 智能手机 (Smartphone):** The smartphone is the *device* used, but it doesn't provide the ability to translate offline.
*   **D: 实时翻译类应用 (Real-time translation applications):** This is the *type* of application, not what allows for offline translation.



"
以下哪项不是雪崩的触发因素？,"The correct answer is **A: 粘雪 (Sticky snow)**.

Here's why:

The passage explains that snow has strong cohesion (stickiness) and *needs* a trigger to cause an avalanche. Sticky snow itself isn't a trigger; it's a characteristic of the snow that *requires* something else to overcome its stability.

The passage specifically mentions:

* **Humans:** ""...more often than not, human factors.""
* **Sunshine:** ""Sometimes the initial trigger is the sun warming the snow...""
* **Extra snowfall:** ""Sometimes it's a bit more snow...""

Therefore, sticky snow is not a trigger, but a factor that *needs* a trigger to be overcome.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪项是以雪崩的形式下降的？,"The correct answer is **C: 陡峭山坡上的过多积雪 (Excess snow on steep slopes)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""雪崩并不是异常现象；陡坡上所能容纳的雪量有限，多余的雪就会以雪崩的形式坠落。"" (Avalanches are not unusual; steep slopes can only hold a certain amount of snow, and excess snow falls in the form of an avalanche.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 未被触发的粘雪 (Untriggered sticky snow):** The passage says snow needs a trigger to avalanche, so untriggered snow doesn't fall as an avalanche.
* **B: 没有雪的陡峭山坡 (Steep slopes with no snow):**  There's no avalanche if there's no snow.
* **D: 人类未触碰的雪 (Snow untouched by humans):** While the passage mentions human factors *can* trigger avalanches, the snow itself that avalanches is still excess snow, not just snow that hasn't been touched.



"
根据这段文字，咖喱的基本成分是什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 香草和香料 (herbs and spices)**.

The text explicitly states: ""咖喱饭菜是一道以**香草和香料**为主的菜肴..."" (Curry dishes are dishes mainly based on **herbs and spices**...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 酸奶和水 (yogurt and water)** - While yogurt is used in *some* curries, it's not a basic component of *all* curries. Water is used to adjust consistency, but isn't a defining ingredient.
*   **C: 椰奶和肉 (coconut milk and meat)** -  Coconut milk is used in *some* curries, and meat can be *added*, but they aren't fundamental to all curries.
*   **D: 蔬菜和牛奶 (vegetables and milk)** - Vegetables are often *included* but not the base. Milk isn't specifically mentioned as a basic component.



"
在某些地区，椰奶有时会代替咖喱中的哪种成分？,"The correct answer is **C: 酸奶 (Yogurt)**.

The passage states: ""在印度北部和巴基斯坦的内陆地区，咖喱中常常使用酸奶；而在印度南部和次大陆其他一些沿海地区，则常常使用椰奶。"" This directly indicates that coconut milk sometimes replaces yogurt in curry in certain regions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 肉类 (Meat)** - The passage states curry is *served with* meat or vegetables, not that coconut milk replaces it.
*   **B: 蔬菜 (Vegetables)** - Same as above.
*   **D: 香料 (Spices)** - Spices are a core ingredient *in* curry, not something replaced by coconut milk.



"
为什么绕过横贯南极山脉才能进入高原？,"The correct answer is **C: 专业的拖拉机不够灵活**.

The passage specifically states: ""**车子并不是很灵活，所以必须绕着横贯南极山脉，拐一个长长的的大弯才能来到高原。**"" (The vehicles are not very flexible, so they must go around the Transantarctic Mountains, taking a long detour to reach the plateau.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 麦克默多站通常关闭 (McMurdo Station is usually closed)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about the station being closed.
* **B: 压实的雪很危险 (The compacted snow is dangerous)** - The passage states the snow is *compacted* and *marked*, implying it's made safe for travel.
* **D: 这比通过罗斯海旅行更容易 (This is easier than traveling through the Ross Sea)** - The passage doesn't compare this route to traveling through the Ross Sea.



"
沿着南极横贯线，有什么用旗帜标了出来？,"The correct answer is **C: 填满雪的缝隙 (Filled snow gaps)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""雪被压实，缝隙也被填满，并用旗帜做了标记"" which translates to ""The snow is compacted, the gaps are filled, and marked with flags.""  This directly indicates that flags were used to mark the filled gaps in the snow along the traverse.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 麦克默多站的道路 (The road from McMurdo Station)** - While the traverse *starts* at McMurdo Station, the flags mark something *along* the road, not the road itself.
*   **B: 装有燃料的拖拉机 (Fuel-carrying tractors)** - Tractors use the road, they aren't *marked* by flags.
*   **D: 危险的绕山路线 (The dangerous route around the mountains)** - The passage mentions the route, but doesn't say flags mark it. It just describes *why* the route is that way.



"
在探索南部非洲时，文章中没有提到游客应该注意什么？,"The correct answer is **C: 几乎所有与南部非洲接壤的国家都是稳定的**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""while Southern Africa is stable, not all neighboring countries are."" This directly contradicts option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 不同的国家对签证的要求不同** - The passage says, ""Visa requirements and costs vary from country to country and are affected by your nationality.""
* **B: 开车探索是访问偏远地区的好方法** - The passage states, ""Self-driving is a great way to see all the region has to offer and to reach places off the beaten track.""
* **D: 如果开车旅行，建议使用四驱汽车** - The passage says, ""a 4x4 is strongly recommended, and in many places only a long-wheelbase 4x4 will get you through.""



"
根据这段文字，对于想要开车探索南部非洲的游客来说，下列哪项会被认为是错误的建议？,"The correct answer is **B: 尽管建议使用四驱汽车，但大多数地点可以使用普通汽车到达.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""While a normal car can do it with careful planning, a 4x4 is strongly recommended, and many places are only accessible by a long-wheelbase 4x4."" This directly contradicts the idea that *most* places are accessible by a normal car. It implies quite the opposite – that a 4x4 is often *necessary*.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the text:

*   **A: 根据法律可能需要某些车内紧急物品** - The passage states, ""Each country has specific laws dictating essential items that must be carried in the vehicle.""
*   **C: 通过汽车旅行非常适合那些想偏离常规路线的人** - The passage begins by saying, ""Southern Africa is ideal for a road trip, allowing visitors to see all the beauty the region has to offer and get off the beaten track.""
*   **D: 并非所有与南部非洲接壤的国家都适合参观** - The passage states, ""While Southern Africa is stable, not all neighbouring countries are.""



"
这段文字中没有提到以下哪项是无人看管行李的潜在危险？,"The correct answer is **C: They might be mistaken for someone else's.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    * **A: They might be stolen:** ""无人看管的袋子不仅是窃贼的目标..."" (Unattended bags are also targets for thieves...)
    * **B: You might unintentionally become a drug trafficker:** ""你可能会发现自己被人利用，在不知情的情况下成了一个运毒者..."" (You may find yourself being used, becoming a drug trafficker without your knowledge...)
    * **D: Authorities might consider them potential bomb threats:** ""...还会被当成炸弹威胁，引起当局的警惕和关注。"" (...also be considered a bomb threat, attracting the attention of the authorities.)

* **The passage does *not* mention** anything about bags being mistaken for someone else's. 

Therefore, **C** is the only option *not* covered in the text.



"
关于携带毒品，文中没有提到哪一点？,"The correct answer is **D: 当局可能会没收你的行李，即使你没有携带毒品**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses entirely on the *risk* of unknowingly carrying drugs *for someone else*.** It warns about being used as a drug mule. It doesn't mention authorities confiscating luggage from innocent travelers who haven't been compromised in that way.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned in the passage:

* **A: 在某些国家，初犯可能会被判死刑** - The passage explicitly states this: ""Some countries even impose extremely severe penalties for first-time offenders; penalties may include imprisonment for 10 years or more, or even the death penalty.""
* **B: 在国际旅行时需要采取额外的预防措施** - The entire passage is a warning and advice about precautions to take during international travel (""...never let your luggage out of your sight, especially when going through immigration and customs."").
* **C: 可能会在没有通知的情况下使用缉毒犬** - The passage states: ""...including while queuing, as sniffer dogs can be used at any time without prior notice.""



"
哪种饮品没有被提到是在居家度假期间可以尝试在家里制作的？,"The correct answer is **C: 啤酒 (Beer)**.

Here's why:

* **咖啡 (Coffee)** is explicitly mentioned as something enjoyed in the morning.
* **茶 (Tea)**, specifically chamomile tea, is mentioned as a relaxing evening drink.
* **果汁 (Juice)** and **混合奶昔 (smoothies)** are suggested as options to try making at home for something different.
* **啤酒 (Beer)** is only mentioned in the context of visiting bars and pubs in different neighborhoods, *not* as something to make at home during the staycation.

Therefore, beer is the only drink from the options that isn't suggested for home preparation during the staycation."
如果你所在的城市以饮酒文化闻名，那么在家度假期间你应该参观以下哪里？,"The correct answer is **C: 你不常去的酒吧 (You don't usually visit bars)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""如果你生活的城市有多种饮酒文化，那就去那些你不常去的街区的酒吧或酒馆 (If your city has a diverse drinking culture, go to bars or pubs in neighborhoods you don't usually visit).""

The question specifically asks what you should visit *if* your city is known for its drinking culture.  The passage directly answers that with ""bars or pubs you don't usually visit.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 你所在街区以外的咖啡馆 (Cafes outside your neighborhood):** While the passage mentions coffee, it doesn't suggest exploring different cafes as part of experiencing the city's drinking culture.
*   **B: 果汁或冰沙店 (Juice or smoothie shops):** The passage suggests making these at home, not visiting a shop.
*   **D: 泡甘菊茶的餐厅 (Restaurants that serve chamomile tea):** Chamomile tea is mentioned as a relaxing drink to make *at home*, not a place to visit for a cultural experience.



"
鸽子雕塑位于哪里？,"The correct answer is **B: 在教堂墓地里 (In the church cemetery)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""在教堂墓地里，一些坟墓上方摆着有趣的大理石鸽子雕塑"" (In the church cemetery, some graves are adorned with interesting marble dove sculptures).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 距离村庄半小时路程 (Half an hour from the village)** - The passage says a walk *in* the village is worth it, not that the sculptures are a half hour away.
*   **C: 在依斯特洛伊岛上 (On Eysturoy Island)** - The passage mentions Eysturoy Island as a view *from* the village, not the location of the sculptures.
*   **D: 在教堂内部 (Inside the church)** - The passage specifically says the sculptures are in the *cemetery* (墓地), not the church itself.



"
哪种类型的签证可能需要提供足够的资金支持证明？,"The correct answer is **D: 学生签证**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""学生签证通常有不同的要求和申请程序...你需要一份你希望就读的学校的录取通知书，以及证明你有至少第一年课程所需资金的文件.""

The other options are incorrect because the passage doesn't mention financial proof as a requirement for business, tourist, or temporary visas.



"
谁最有可能需要延长签证？,"The correct answer is **C: 一位国际学生 (An international student)**.

**Here's why:**

The passage states that students typically stay longer than tourists or business travelers, and longer stays *usually* require a visa. It specifically mentions student visas have different requirements and procedures.  Therefore, a student is most likely to need to deal with visa extensions if their studies last beyond the initial visa period.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: 一位普通的旅游者 (A typical tourist):** Tourists generally don't stay long enough to need extensions if they entered visa-free or with a short-term visa.
* **B: 一位经验丰富的旅行者 (An experienced traveler):** Experience doesn't change the need for a visa based on *length of stay*.
* **D: 一位商务旅行者 (A business traveler):** Business trips are usually short-term, like tourist visits.



"
你应该在什么时候特别注意蚊子？,"The best answer is **C: 在雨林中**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states you need to be careful of mosquitoes ""if you decide to hike through a rainforest"" *and* ""while driving through a subtropical rainforest.""**  This makes the rainforest the common thread.
* While the passage *mentions* summer and hiking, those are specific *situations* within the broader context of being in a rainforest. Driving is also mentioned.
* The question asks *when* to be particularly careful, and the passage consistently points to the rainforest environment.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

* **A: 夏季月份 (Summer months):** Summer is mentioned, but it's not the primary focus. The rainforest is.
* **B: 徒步旅行时 (When hiking):** Hiking is only *one* scenario given.
* **D: 驾车时 (When driving):** Driving is only *one* scenario given.



"
根据这段文字，为了避免在开车穿越雨林时被蚊子叮咬，你应该避免做什么？,"The correct answer is **A: 让车门敞开时间过长 (Letting the car door stay open for too long)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""...in the few seconds your door is open as you get into the car, is enough for mosquitoes to get in with you."" This directly links open car doors to mosquitoes entering the vehicle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 夏季驾车穿越雨林 (Driving through the rainforest in summer)** - The passage mentions mosquitoes are *especially* a concern in summer, but doesn't say you should avoid driving then, just be more cautious.
* **C: 驾车穿越亚热带地区 (Driving through subtropical regions)** - While the passage refers to a *subtropical* rainforest, it's the open door that's the problem, not the location itself.
* **D: 在徒步旅行时让车辆无人看管 (Leaving the vehicle unattended while hiking)** - The passage mentions hiking separately, but doesn't connect this to mosquito bites *within the car*.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项有关孙德本尔斯的陈述是不正确的？,"The correct answer is **B: Its total area is half covered by wetlands.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 sq km of which approximately one-third is under water/wetlands."" 
* **One-third is NOT half.** Half would be 50%, while one-third is approximately 33%.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: It holds one of the few remaining large forests:** The text says ""...some remnants of the vast forests that once covered the Ganges plain.""
* **C: It is the world's largest mangrove forest:** The first sentence states this directly.
* **D: More spotted deer live here than Bengal tigers:** The text states ""approximately 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer.""
"
森林的哪一部分位于印度领土之内？,"The correct answer is **A: 孙德本尔斯国家公园 (Sundarbans National Park)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""印度境内的这部分森林被称为孙德尔本斯国家公园 (The part of the forest within India is known as Sundarbans National Park)."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 野生动物保护区 (Wildlife sanctuary):** While Sundarbans *is* a wildlife sanctuary, the passage doesn't state it's the part *within* India.
* **C: 世界遗产 (World Heritage Site):** This is a designation for the entire Sundarbans region, not specifically the Indian portion.
* **D: 恒河平原 (Ganges Plain):** The passage mentions the forest contains remnants of jungles that *used* to cover the Ganges Plain, but it isn't the part located in India.



"
根据这段文字，哪一类人最可能至少具有有限的英语语言理解能力？,"The correct answer is **B: 年龄较小的人**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""in more countries, people have at least some familiarity with English, *especially younger people*."" This directly supports the idea that younger people are more likely to have at least a basic understanding of English.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: 至少会讲其他两种语言的人 (People who speak at least two other languages):** The passage doesn't establish a connection between multilingualism and English understanding.
*   **C: 前往多伦多旅游的人 (People traveling to Toronto):** While some tourists might know English, the passage doesn't focus on tourists specifically.
*   **D: 年龄较大的人 (Older people):** The passage explicitly states that *younger* people are more likely to have some familiarity with English.



"
根据这段文字，哪种内容会很难发音？,"The correct answer is **B: 地址**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""In describing addresses this is particularly true, as it is often difficult to pronounce them clearly."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 带有独特口音的单词 (Words with distinct accents):** While the passage *mentions* accents (with the example of the people from different places), it doesn't say these are *difficult to pronounce* - just that they are unique and contribute to storytelling.
* **C: 书面文字 (Written text):** The passage actually says written text is *easier* to understand than spoken language.
* **D: 当地的土语 (Local dialects):**  Again, the passage mentions these contribute to storytelling and amusement, but doesn't say they are hard to pronounce.



"
根据这段文字，哪种情况是一个计划从城区间公交站乘坐公交车的旅客的理想选择？,"The correct answer is **A: 旅客前往贾卡尔，并已事先购买了车票**. Here's why:

* **贾卡尔 (Jakar):** The text specifically mentions that buses to Jakar/Bumthang *primarily* leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
* **提前购票 (Pre-purchasing tickets):** The text *strongly recommends* buying tickets a few days in advance because buses often get full.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 旅客前往布姆唐，并需要在 7 点前离开 (Traveling to Bumthang and needing to leave before 7 AM):**  While buses go to Bumthang, needing to leave *before* 7 AM doesn't guarantee a bus. The text says they *mostly* leave *between* 6:30-7:30, not before.
* **C: 旅客前往帕罗，并需要在 11 点后离开 (Traveling to Paro and needing to leave after 11 AM):** The text says shared taxis are a good option for nearby places like Paro, but doesn’t imply any ideal time.
* **D: 旅客前往东部，并在 6:20 之前到达车站 (Traveling East and arriving at the station before 6:20 AM):** The buses to the East *mostly* leave between 6:30-7:30. Arriving before 6:20 doesn't guarantee you’ll be on one of those buses and could be unnecessary.



"
对于一名想要从城区间公交站前往东部的游客来说，有什么好的建议吗？,"The correct answer is **B: 提前购买车票 (Buy tickets in advance)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""鉴于区间巴士经常客满，建议提前几天购票 (Given that inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to purchase tickets a few days in advance).""  This directly addresses the advice for someone traveling to the east.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 公交车仅在 8:30 之后发车 (Buses only depart after 8:30)** - This is *incorrect*. The passage says most buses to the east depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
* **C: 许多公交车在全天发车 (Many buses depart throughout the day)** - This is *misleading*. While buses depart *all day*, the passage stresses that most to the east leave very early.
* **D: 共享出租车可能是最明智的旅行方式 (Shared taxis might be the most sensible way to travel)** - While shared taxis are mentioned as a good option for *nearby* places like Paro and Punakha, the passage doesn't specifically suggest them as the *best* way to the east.



"
以下哪个不是对廷巴克图的准确描述？,"The correct answer is **C: It cannot be reached by plane.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...廷巴克图的名声使之成为旅游胜地，而且有一个机场..."" ( ""...Timbuktu’s reputation has made it a tourist destination, and it has an airport..."")

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurate based on the text:

* **A: It is more influenced by Arab culture than other places in the country:** The passage says ""...这座城市与该国其他城市形成了鲜明对比，因为它更多的是阿拉伯风格，而不是非洲风格。"" (...the city stands in contrast to other cities in the country in that it is more Arabic than African in style.)
* **B: It is very poor:** The passage states ""...但这是一个贫穷的城镇。"" (...but it is a poor town.)
* **D: It still attracts curious tourists:** The passage states ""...廷巴克图的名声使之成为旅游胜地..."" (...Timbuktu’s reputation has made it a tourist destination...)



"
以下有关廷巴克图的哪个事实是正确的？,"The correct answer is **A: 该城市可通过飞机到达 (The city is accessible by plane)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""today, although Timbuktu’s reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it *has an airport*..."" This directly confirms that Timbuktu is accessible by plane.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 比起贫穷，它更具有异国情调 (It is more exotic than poor):** The passage states it *is* a poor town, despite its reputation.  It doesn't say exotic outweighs poverty.
* **C: 与周边城市相比，它的非洲风格较少 (It has less African style compared to surrounding cities):** The passage states it has *more* Arabic style than African style, not less African style than other cities.
* **D: 这座城市不再吸引游客 (The city no longer attracts tourists):** The passage explicitly says it *is* a tourist destination.



"
原定于什么时候举办夏季奥运会？ ,"The correct answer is **D: 2020 年 7 月**.

The text states: ""如果你在宣布推迟之前预订了 2020 年的航班和住宿，则可能会面临棘手的情况。...截至三月末，大多数由于新冠病毒而出台的取消政策并没有延长到 2020 年 7 月——原定奥运会举办时间。"" 

This clearly indicates the original planned date for the Olympics was July 2020."
根据这段文字，漏斗状云何时会变成龙卷风？,"The correct answer is **D: 接触地面后 (Contacting the ground)**.

The text specifically states: ""当它们接触地面时就变成了“龙卷风” (When they touch the ground, they become a ""tornado"").""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 当风速达到大约每小时 100 英里时 (When the wind speed reaches around 100 miles per hour):** The text mentions strong winds *associated* with tornadoes, but doesn't say that's when a funnel cloud *becomes* a tornado.
* **B: 当气流柱开始旋转时 (When the air column starts rotating):** While rotation is a characteristic of tornadoes, the text doesn't state this is the defining moment it becomes one.
* **C: 从雷暴云中向下伸展时 (When extending downward from a thunderstorm cloud):**  This is how a tornado *starts*, but it's not a tornado yet. It needs to touch the ground.



"
下列哪一项是龙卷风的准确特征？,"The correct answer is **B: 它们常常移动重物 (They often move heavy objects)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""龙卷风会产生强风（常常每小时 100-200 英里），能把重物抛到空中，并裹挟着它们向前移动。"" (Tornadoes produce strong winds (often 100-200 miles per hour) that can throw heavy objects into the air and move them forward.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 它们总是产生大约每小时 100-200 英里的风 (They always produce about 100-200 miles per hour of wind)** - The passage says ""常常"" (often), not ""总是"" (always).
* **C: 它们在接触地面后变成漏斗状云 (They become funnel-shaped clouds after touching the ground)** - The passage states the *opposite*: ""刚开始时，漏斗状云从雷暴云中向下伸展，当它们接触地面时就变成了“龙卷风”."" (Initially, a funnel-shaped cloud extends downward from a thunderstorm cloud, and when it touches the ground, it becomes a ""tornado."")
* **D: 它们是向外推动空气的旋转气流柱 (They are rotating columns of air that push air outward)** - The passage explicitly says they *suck* air in and up, not push it out.



"
根据这段文字，旅行者应该从哪里获得有关其目的地城市政治局势的建议？,"The correct answer is **D: From自己的政府** (From your own government).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""You can also consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is formulated for *their* citizens."" This highlights that advice from other governments is not directly applicable to you.
* **The text also points out limitations of travel warnings:** They are ""brief summaries"" and ""often cursory, general and oversimplified."" They aren't a detailed source of information.
* **Option A (From the government of the country you're visiting)** isn't ideal. While helpful, the text implies prioritizing your *own* government's advice because it's tailored to *your* citizenship.
* **Options B and C** are clearly incorrect based on the text.

Therefore, relying on your own government's advice is the most reliable approach, as it's formulated with your nationality in mind."
如果出现旅游警告，外国公民不太可能会遇到什么情况？,"The correct answer is **D: 关于该国政治局势的详细信息**.

Here's why:

The passage states that travel advisories ""often tend to be rather rough, general and overly simplistic"" compared to more detailed information available elsewhere. It also says they only provide a ""brief summary"" of the local situation. Therefore, foreign citizens are *unlikely* to find detailed information *within* the travel warning itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 取消保险受到影响 (Cancellation insurance affected):** The passage explicitly states travel advisories *can* affect cancellation insurance.
*   **B: 关于该国政治局势过于简单的摘要 (Oversimplified summary of the country's political situation):** The passage says travel warnings *are* oversimplified summaries.
*   **C: 健康保险受到影响 (Health insurance affected):** The passage explicitly states travel advisories *can* affect health insurance.



"
根据这段文字，哪种旅行最不可能需要旅行社提供预订帮助？,"The correct answer is **A: 去参加旅行者之前去过的城市的工作会议**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states travel agencies are helpful when travelers are *unfamiliar* with a destination's nature, culture, and language.** If someone has been to a city before, especially for work, they are likely already familiar with it and won't need the agency's expertise.

Let's look at why the other options are likely to *need* a travel agency:

* **B: 一个预算特定的为期两周的旅行** - The passage mentions agencies specializing in specific budgets.
* **C: 将会遇到语言障碍的旅行** - The passage explicitly states agencies are helpful when there's a language barrier.
* **D: 旅行者的第一次出国旅行** -  Being unfamiliar with a destination (which a first-time international traveler would be) is a key reason to use a travel agency, according to the passage.



"
根据这段文字，在哪种情况下旅行者最能从旅行社的帮助中受益？,"The correct answer is **B: 当旅行者有兴趣第一次预订特色旅游时**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""如果在一段旅程中，旅行者不熟悉目的地的自然、文化和语言，或者计划去低收入国家旅行，那么旅行社一般会是很好的选择。"" This directly supports needing help with unfamiliar trips.  ""特色旅游"" (specialty tours) often involve unfamiliar destinations or activities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't suggest a need for a travel agent when visiting a familiar place like home.
* **C:** The passage states travel agents are *helpful* when travelers *don't* know the local language.
* **D:**  The passage suggests help is needed when travelers are *unfamiliar* with cultural differences, not familiar with them.



"
根据这段文字，什么可以帮助旅行者避免在新地方失望？,"The correct answer is **B: 愿意尝试不熟悉的食物**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""礼节、法律、饮食、交通、住宿、标准和语言等等都会与你居住的地方有所不同."" and ""避免失望或者甚至对当地的做法表示厌恶.""  This means being open to differences, including in *diet* (food), is key to avoiding disappointment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 期望与自己来自的地方相似的标准** - The passage directly warns *against* this. Expecting things to be the same as home leads to disappointment.
* **C: 遵守与自己来自的地方相同的法律** - The passage states laws will be *different*, so following your home country's laws isn't helpful and could even be problematic.
* **D: 避免在住宿方面提前进行研究** - The passage doesn't mention avoiding research; it simply says accommodation will be different.  Researching *is* a good idea, but doesn't address the core issue of adapting to differences.



"
根据这段文字的信息，哪种人在去外国旅行时可能会感到失望？,"The correct answer is **C: 心态封闭的人 (People with a closed mindset)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that travelers should *not* expect everything to be like ""at home"" and that differences in customs, laws, food, etc., are inevitable.
* It warns that failing to remember this can lead to **disappointment** or even dislike of local practices.
* A ""closed mindset"" implies an unwillingness to accept or appreciate differences, making someone likely to be disappointed when things aren't as they're used to.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 喜欢异国美食的人 (People who like exotic food)** - This suggests openness to new experiences, the opposite of what the passage warns against.
* **B: 追求变化的人 (People who seek change)** -  They'd likely embrace the differences mentioned in the text.
* **D: 喜欢学习的人 (People who like to learn)** -  They would be open to understanding and appreciating the differences.



"
以下哪项不是给首次访问发展中国家的旅客的建议？,"The correct answer is **B: 在最初几天里，避免在食物上挥霍** (In the initial days, avoid splurging on food).

Here's why:

The passage *recommends* spending *more* on Western-style and high-quality hotels, food, and services to help adjust to the environment. It doesn't suggest avoiding spending on food.  

Let's look at why the other options are correct advice from the passage:

* **A: 在露天睡觉前了解当地的动物群** (Learn about the local fauna before sleeping outdoors) - The passage specifically warns against sleeping on the ground without knowing about local animals like snakes and scorpions.
* **C: 如果野营，建议带上露营床或吊床** (If camping, it's recommended to bring a cot or hammock) - This is directly stated in the passage as a safety measure.
* **D: 初来乍到时，选择高质量酒店** (Choose high-quality hotels when first arriving) - The passage advises spending more on ""Western-style and high-quality hotels"" initially to help with adjustment.



"
在适应发展中国家时，以下哪项没有被提到是值得多花钱的东西？,"The correct answer is **C: 露营用的床垫或垫子**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly recommends spending *more* money on:

*   **西式食物 (Western food)** - ""consider spending more...on Western and high-quality food""
*   **高质量酒店 (High-quality hotels)** - ""consider spending more...on Western and high-quality hotels""
*   **高品质服务 (High-quality service)** - ""consider spending more...on Western and high-quality...services""

However, the passage *advises against* sleeping on mattresses or pads on the ground and recommends bringing a **camping bed or hammock** specifically to *avoid* needing to spend more on better ground bedding. It doesn't suggest spending *more* on the mattress/pad itself. Therefore, camping beds and pads are not mentioned as something to spend more money on to help adapt.



"
以下哪个选项对于想要保险单虚拟副本但可能没有互联网连接的保险单持有人来说最好？,"The correct answer is **C: 将一份副本保存在笔记本电脑的内存中** (Store a copy on your laptop's memory/disk).

Here's why:

* **The question specifically asks about a situation *without* internet access.**
* Option D (cloud storage) *requires* internet access.
* Option B (email) *requires* internet access to retrieve.
* Option A (giving to a travel companion) is helpful, but doesn't provide the individual with direct access to *their* copy without relying on someone else.
* Option C (laptop memory/disk) provides a readily accessible, offline copy for the insurance holder.

The passage explicitly states: ""如果旅行时随身携带笔记本电脑或平板电脑，在内存或磁盘中存储一份副本（无需网络也可访问）。"" (If you are traveling with a laptop or tablet, store a copy in the memory or disk (accessible without a network)).



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不需要在保险单上显示？,"The correct answer is **D: 保险单持有人的电子邮件地址**.

The text explicitly states the need for the insurance company's email address and international phone number for claims and authorization. It *doesn't* mention needing the policy holder's email address on the insurance documentation itself.  It suggests using the policy holder's email to *store* a copy of the insurance information, but not to display it *on* the insurance information.
"
根据这段文字，哪种底片尺寸反映了最常用的胶片格式？,"The correct answer is **D: 36 x 24 mm 底片**.

The text states: ""标准 35mm 胶片（36x24mm 底片）是最常见的."" (Standard 35mm film (36x24mm) was the most common.)

While the text *mentions* 6x6cm (56x56mm) and 35mm, it specifically identifies 36x24mm as the *most common* format.
"
以下哪种胶片格式的分辨率与数码单反相机相似？,"The correct answer is **A: 35 mm 胶片**.

The passage states: ""标准 35mm 胶片（36x24mm 底片）是最常见的...所呈现的分辨率大致与当前的数码单反相机无差。"" (Standard 35mm film... presents a resolution roughly comparable to current digital SLR cameras.)

The other options refer to medium format film, which the passage specifically states has *higher* resolution than 35mm film and digital SLRs.
"
根据这段文字，在开展旅行写作业务时，以下哪项是最后一步？,"The correct answer is **C: 建立自己的网站**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""熟悉网上排版和编辑后，你便可创建自己的网站。"" (After becoming familiar with online typesetting and editing, you can create your own website.)  This clearly indicates creating your own website is the final step *after* gaining skills in typesetting and editing – which you do by writing for an established blog.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 练习网上排版 (Practice online typesetting)** - This is a skill you need *before* creating your own website, not the last step.
*   **B: 为资深旅行博客写几篇文章 (Write a few articles for an established travel blog)** - This is the *first* step, used to gain experience.
*   **D: 磨练编辑技能 (Hone your editing skills)** -  Similar to typesetting, this is a skill to develop *before* creating your own website.



"
在开始旅行写作业务时，哪种能力有可能首先被完善？,"The correct answer is **B: 网上排版 (Online typesetting/formatting)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the *first* step is to practice on an established travel blog. This implies you'll be learning how things are laid out and presented *online* – that is, online typesetting/formatting – before you're ready to build your own site.  The passage specifically mentions becoming ""familiar with online typesetting and editing"" *before* creating your own website.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: 博客写作 (Blog writing):** While you *will* be doing blog writing, the passage focuses on learning the technical aspects *through* that writing, not blog writing as the primary skill to develop first.
* **C: 编辑 (Editing):** Editing is mentioned alongside typesetting, but the passage's structure suggests typesetting is the initial skill gained.
* **D: 网站创建 (Website creation):**  The passage states website creation comes *after* you're familiar with online formatting and editing.



"
在哪种气候下，肠道问题通常很普遍？,"The correct answer is **C: 炎热气候 (Warm climate)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""正如寒冷气候易发呼吸道问题，炎热气候也极易引发肠道问题."" 

Therefore, the answer is clearly found within the text."
根据这段文字，经常暴露可能导致哪方面免疫力的增强？,"The correct answer is **B: 当地病菌 (local germs)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""在家时，由于会经常接触当地病菌，你极易对其产生免疫力。"" (When at home, due to frequent contact with local germs, you are very likely to develop immunity to them.)

The question asks what frequent exposure leads to increased immunity *to*. The passage directly answers this with ""当地病菌"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 肠道问题 (intestinal problems):** The passage says warm climates *cause* intestinal problems, not that exposure to them builds immunity.
*   **C: 呼吸道问题 (respiratory problems):** The passage mentions respiratory problems are common in cold climates, but doesn't link frequent exposure to immunity.
*   **D: 德里腹泻 (Delhi belly):** Delhi belly is an example of an intestinal problem, not something you build immunity to.



"
在申根区内旅行的好处是什么？,"The correct answers are **A, B, and C**. Here's why:

* **A: 避免多次签证申请 (Avoid multiple visa applications)** - The passage explicitly states ""有了申根签证，你就不必分别向每个申根成员国申请签证"" (With a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply for visas to each Schengen member state separately).
* **B: 省钱 (Save money)** - The passage mentions saving ""时间、金钱和手续"" (time, money, and procedures).
* **C: 避免多个护照检查站 (Avoid multiple passport check stations)** - The passage says ""可以直接通过边境，无需再次接受护照检查点的检查"" (You can pass through borders directly without re-experiencing passport checkpoints).

* **D: 不需要护照 (Don't need a passport)** - This is incorrect. The passage states you avoid *repeated* passport checks, not that you don't need a passport at all. You still need a passport to enter the Schengen Area initially.



Therefore, the best answer is a combination of A, B, and C. Since we must choose only one, **A is the most direct and central benefit described in the passage.** However, B and C are also directly supported by the text."
图坦卡蒙墓里不再能找到什么？,"The correct answer is **D: 财富 (wealth)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""The immense wealth from the tomb is no longer in the tomb, having been moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 一些装饰 (some decorations):** The passage says the decorations are ""modest,"" but doesn't say they are *gone*.
*   **B: 木乃伊的头部 (the mummy's head):** The passage states you *can* see the head.
*   **C: 木乃伊的肩膀 (the mummy's shoulders):** The passage states you *can* see the shoulders.



"
根据这段文字，哪个温哥华景点对注重价格的旅行者最没有吸引力？ ,"The correct answer is **D: 惠斯勒**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Whistler is ""expensive"" due to hosting the 2010 Winter Olympics. This directly indicates it's less attractive to price-conscious travelers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 格兰维尔岛 (Granville Island)** - This is mentioned as the departure point for the Bowen Island ferry, implying accessibility, not cost.
*   **B: Sea to Sky Corridor** - The text says people ""inevitably hike the Sea to Sky,"" indicating it's a popular activity, and doesn't mention price.
*   **C: 宝云岛 (Bowen Island)** - The text presents Bowen Island as a popular destination with various activities, without mentioning it being particularly expensive.



"
根据这段文字，哪个景点最有可能为旅行者提供地道的温哥华体验？,"The correct answer is **A: 宝云岛 (Bowen Island)**.

Here's why:

* **The text specifically states that Bowen Island is a ""genuine community"" near Vancouver.** This suggests a more authentic, local experience compared to the other options.
* **It's easily accessible from Vancouver** (""regular aqua taxi from downtown Vancouver – Granville Island""), making it a convenient and integrated part of the Vancouver area experience.
* **While Whistler is mentioned, it's presented as expensive and a destination *outside* of Vancouver** (1.5 hours drive). It's known internationally, not specifically for being a ""Vancouver"" experience.
* **Granville Island is a departure point *to* Bowen Island**, not a destination in itself highlighted for its authentic Vancouver feel.
* **Downtown Vancouver is simply a starting point.**



Therefore, Bowen Island is the most likely to offer a traveler a genuine taste of the area around Vancouver."
根据这段文字，如果旅行者希望寻求无遮挡的景观，他们应该什么时候参观瀑布？,"The correct answer is **D: 雨季外**.

Here's why:

The text states that *during* the rainy season (November to March) the view of the falls is obstructed by the large volume of water. It implies that *outside* of the rainy season, the water levels are lower and the view is clearer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 11 月至 3 月 (November to March)** - This is *when* the view is obstructed, not when it's clear.
*   **B: 旅游旺季期间 (During peak tourist season)** - The text doesn't link peak season to visibility.
*   **C: 水量较高时 (When water levels are high)** -  High water levels *reduce* visibility, as stated in the text.



"
根据这段文字，在 11 月至 3 月期间参观维多利亚瀑布有什么好处？,"The correct answer is **C: 壮观的瀑布景观 (Spectacular views of the falls)**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""In the rainy season (November to March), the water volume is higher and the falls are more turbulent."" While it also notes you *can't* see the whole falls due to the mist, the increased water volume makes the falls more ""turbulent"" and implies a more powerful and impressive spectacle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 无遮挡的瀑布景观 (Unobstructed views of the falls):** The text explicitly says the opposite – the mist *obstructs* the view.
*   **B: 较少的游客 (Fewer tourists):** The text doesn't mention tourist numbers.
*   **D: 避免雨季 (Avoiding the rainy season):** The question is about benefits *during* the rainy season, not avoiding it.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不建议使用无人机进行拍摄？,"The correct answer is **D: 仅在无人机不容易被察觉的人群拥挤的地方拍摄**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""在机场附近或人群拥挤的地方操控无人机升空，是个馊主意，即使这在你所在地区并不违法。"" (Operating a drone near airports or in crowded areas is a bad idea, even if it isn't illegal in your area.)  This directly discourages flying drones in crowded areas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 提前仔细确认可以拍摄的内容** (Confirming what you're allowed to film) - The text *encourages* this: ""If using a drone, carefully confirm in advance what can be filmed...""
* **B: 获得额外的牌照** (Obtaining extra licenses) - The text mentions needing permits or licenses, implying it's something to consider.
* **C: 研究许可证** (Researching permits) - This is part of the advice about checking what's allowed.



"
根据这段文字，使用无人机进行拍摄的最佳地点在哪里？,"The correct answer is **D: 在你事先获得许可的区域**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""If using a drone, be sure to check beforehand what you are allowed to film, and what permits or additional licenses you may need."" This directly supports the idea of getting permission *before* flying and filming.
* **The passage also warns against risky locations:** It discourages flying near airports or crowds, even if legal, implying safe and permitted locations are preferred.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 靠近人群，无人会介意无人机的存在** - The passage specifically warns against flying near crowds.
* **B: 在不允许常规摄影的区域** - The passage states the opposite – if photography is prohibited, videography is even more so.
* **C: 在无人机不易被察觉的繁忙区域** - This is a risky and potentially illegal suggestion, contradicting the passage's advice to be careful and check permissions.



"
根据这段文字，关于签证流程的注册要求，以下哪项说法不正确？,"The correct answer is **B: 所有国家都要求向当地政府登记**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""In *some* countries, you must register..."". This directly contradicts the statement that *all* countries require registration.
* **Option A is correct:** The passage says ""...only those living in accommodation other than tourist accommodation need to register."" and ""...if you are staying in tourist accommodation, you may not need to register.""
* **Option C is correct:** The passage explicitly mentions going to an immigration office.
* **Option D is correct:** The passage states ""In many countries with such laws, local hotels can handle the registration process...""

Therefore, option B is the only statement that isn't supported by the text."
以下哪个不是游客可能去办理注册手续的地方？,"The correct answer is **C: 当地邮局 (Local Post Office)**.

The passage specifically mentions these places for registration:

*   当地警察局 (Local Police Station)
*   旅馆 (Hotels)
*   移民办公室 (Immigration Office)

It does **not** mention the post office. Therefore, the post office is the place a tourist would *not* likely go to for registration."
哪些人不会从旅行中的志愿服务受益？,"The correct answer is **B: 寻求可观的薪资的人**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...有些工作还有少量工资"" (some positions offer a small stipend). This implies volunteer work doesn't provide *substantial* income.  Someone seeking a significant salary would *not* benefit from this type of travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 希望在国外结识新朋友的人:** The passage explicitly states it's a good way to ""结识新朋友"" (meet new friends).
* **C: 希望获得新技能的人:** The passage says it can be a way to ""获得新技能"" (gain new skills).
* **D: 可能对食宿感兴趣的人:** The passage highlights that many volunteer positions ""提供食宿"" (offer room and board).



"
根据这段文字，海外志愿服务对预算有限的旅行者有什么好处？,"The correct answer is **C: 有时提供食宿 (Sometimes provides food and lodging)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...也是一个节省预算的好方法，可以在某处待更长时间，因为很多志愿者工作提供食宿，有些工作还有少量工资."" (It's also a good way to save budget and stay somewhere longer, because many volunteer jobs offer food and lodging, and some jobs also offer a small salary.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 几乎总是能拿到工资 (Almost always gets a salary):** The passage says *some* jobs offer a small salary, not that it's guaranteed.
* **B: 通常会带来就业机会 (Usually leads to job opportunities):** The passage doesn't mention job opportunities.
* **D: 可以帮助你锻炼正确判断的能力 (Can help you exercise correct judgment):** While the passage *does* say volunteering can help with that, it's not specifically about the *budget* benefit.  The question asks about the benefit for those with limited budgets.



"
根据这段文字，什么可能不被认为是前往迪斯尼乐园的普通旅行中的“典型”做法？,"The correct answer is **B: 在园外的酒店住宿 (Staying at a hotel outside the parks)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the ""typical"" trip includes staying at a **Disney park hotel** (""乘车前往迪士尼园区酒店"").  Staying *outside* of a Disney park hotel would deviate from this described typical experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 花一周时间探索乐园 (Spending a week exploring the parks)** - The passage says a typical trip lasts ""approximately a week.""
*   **C: 在整个旅程中都待在迪士尼园区内 (Staying within the Disney parks for the entire trip)** - While not explicitly stated, it's implied by staying at a Disney park hotel and spending a week there.
*   **D: 乘坐机场巴士前往酒店 (Taking an airport bus to the hotel)** - The passage mentions ""乘车前往迪士尼园区酒店"" (taking a vehicle to the Disney park hotel), which could include a bus or other transport.



"
以下哪项关于迪斯尼乐园的陈述不正确？,"The correct answer is **A: 通票可以转让给其他旅客**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""门票是不可转让的"" (tickets are non-transferable). While people *do* sell partially used tickets, Disney *prohibits* it. Therefore, saying they *can* be transferred is incorrect.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the text:

*   **B: 有园区住宿** - The passage mentions ""迪士尼园区酒店"" (Disney area hotels), indicating on-site lodging.
*   **C: 有巴士可用于将旅客从机场运送到园区** - The passage mentions taking a ride ""乘车前往迪士尼园区酒店"" (taking a ride to the Disney area hotel) after flying into the airport.
*   **D: 多日通票通常可以在拍卖网站上找到** - The passage specifically states that ""许多在 eBay 或 Craigslist 等拍卖网站上出售的门票都是部分使用过的多日通票"" (Many tickets sold on auction sites like eBay or Craigslist are multi-day passes that have been partially used)."
根据这段文字，以下哪个问题最可能没有涵盖在专业培训课程或出版物中？,"The correct answer is **A: 野外生存**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""关于野外生存的书籍和杂志很常见..."" This implies that while readily available, wildnerness survival isn't the *focus* of the specialized training for hostile environments/war zones.
* **The passage explicitly states the courses cover:**
    * Issues discussed (implied to be related to hostile environments)
    * First aid (急救准备)
    * Role-playing (角色扮演)
    * (Often) armed training (战区准备 is a natural extension of this)

Therefore, wildnerness survival is the only option that isn't directly mentioned as being covered in the training or lacking in published resources.
"
根据这段文字，以下哪个主题最可能涵盖在专业培训课程中？,"The correct answer is **A: 急救**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that the courses ""frequently delve deeper with hands-on experience and **first aid training**..."" 

While the courses relate to war zones and hostile environments (making B and D partially true), and might *include* elements of wilderness survival (C), **first aid is directly mentioned as a component of the training.**

Therefore, 急救 (first aid) is the most likely topic to be covered.
"
根据这段文字，避免潜在受污染水的最佳选择是什么？,"The correct answer is **B: 购买瓶装水**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""if you have concerns...you should consider purchasing bottled water from a reputable company."" This directly suggests it as a safe option when worried about contamination.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 将水煮几分钟 (Boil water for several minutes)** - The text says boiling time *varies* depending on the location, implying it's not always sufficient.
* **C: 将水煮一分钟 (Boil water for one minute)** - The text explicitly states that one minute is *only* enough in *some* areas.
* **D: 评估水受到的特定威胁 (Assess the specific threats to the water)** - While understanding the threats is helpful, the text doesn't present this as a *solution* to avoid contaminated water, but rather context for *how* to choose the right purification method.  It suggests boiling time changes *based* on these threats.



"
根据这段文字，即使对于熟练的游泳者，以下哪项也许几乎是不可能的？,"The correct answer is **C: 逆着水流游泳**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""逆着水流游泳不太可能成功"" (Swimming against the current is unlikely to succeed). This directly addresses the question of what might be almost impossible, even for skilled swimmers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 在珊瑚礁附近游泳 (Swimming near coral reefs):** The passage mentions reefs as places where rip currents *occur*, but doesn't say swimming near them is impossible.
*   **B: 在深水中游泳 (Swimming in deep water):** While rip currents can lead you into deeper water, the passage doesn't imply deep water swimming itself is impossible.
*   **D: 在波浪中游泳 (Swimming in waves):** Waves are mentioned as part of the environment where rip currents happen, but swimming in waves isn't presented as a challenge.



"
如果你被困在水流中，你应该怎么做？,"The correct answer is **A: 尝试通过改变方向来摆脱水流，然后正常游回岸边**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""摆脱湍急水流之后，游回来就没有那么困难了。"" (After getting out of the turbulent flow, swimming back isn't so difficult.)  This means the key is to *escape* the rip current, not fight it directly.
* **The passage also states:** ""逆着水流游泳不太可能成功。"" (Swimming against the current is unlikely to succeed.) This eliminates options B and C.
* **The passage doesn't mention** swimming underwater (option D) as a solution.

Changing direction is a strategy to swim *parallel* to the shore, aiming to get out of the narrow channel of the rip current. Once out, swimming back to shore becomes much easier.



"
根据这段文字，在哪个地方参观城堡可能是一个值得去的假日游览？,"The correct answer is **C: 在莱茵河谷 (In the Rhine Valley)**.

The passage specifically mentions ""visiting castles in the Loire Valley and **Rhine Valley**"". The other options are mentioned, but not in connection with castle visits.

* **A: 多瑙河沿岸的城市 (Cities along the Danube River)** - mentioned as cities to *visit by cruise*, not specifically for castles.
* **B: 伊利运河旁 (Along the Erie Canal)** - mentioned for boat trips, not castles.
* **D: 靠近任何内陆水路 (Near any inland waterway)** - too broad; the passage gives *specific* examples.



"
根据这段文字，以下哪项不会是推荐给在该地区旅行的女性的提示？,"The correct answer is **A: 避免讨论婚姻状况 (Avoid discussing marital status)**.

Here's why:

The text *specifically* **recommends** women state they are married, regardless of their actual marital status. This is the opposite of avoiding discussing it.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

* **B: 意识到文化差异可能导致当地人强制性的行为 (Be aware that cultural differences may lead to locals engaging in coercive behavior):** The text states, ""女性应该意识到文化差异可能会导致她们所认为的骚扰行为"" (Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to behaviors they consider harassment).
* **C: 避免佩戴华丽的珠宝 (Avoid wearing flashy jewelry):**  The text advises, ""不要戴看上去太贵的戒指"" (don't wear rings that look too expensive).
* **D: 必要时坚定果断 (Be firm and assertive when necessary):** The text encourages women to be firm when refusing men, stating, ""拒绝男人时要坚定，别害怕坚持自己的立场"" (Be firm when refusing men, don't be afraid to stand your ground).



"
根据这段文字描述的区域，对于女性游客来说有什么有用的提示？,"The correct answer is **D: 在遇到不受欢迎的求爱时，要坚决拒绝男人 (In the event of unwanted advances, firmly reject men)**.

Here's why:

* **The text specifically advises women to ""refuse men firmly, don't be afraid to stand your ground.""** This is a direct and important safety tip.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 认识到被尾随是不寻常的 (Recognize that being followed is unusual):**  The text states being followed is *not* uncommon – it *will* happen.
* **B: 戴一个大戒指表明婚姻状况 (Wear a large ring to indicate marital status):** The text advises wearing a ring, but specifically says *not* to wear an expensive one.
* **C: 理解文化差异意味着你应该避免坚持自己的立场 (Understanding cultural differences means you should avoid standing your ground):** The text encourages women to stand their ground *despite* cultural differences.



"
根据这段文字，哪种情况可能需要野生动物摄影师使用专业镜头？,"The correct answer is **A: 如果拍摄特别小的生物 (If photographing particularly small creatures)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""拍摄野生动物通常会用到长焦镜头，不过拍鸟群或微小生物之类的对象则需要其他镜头。"" (Long focal length lenses are often used for wildlife photography, but other lenses are needed for subjects like flocks of birds or small creatures.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 如果照片用于商业目的 (If the photos are for commercial purposes):** While the text mentions regulations *regarding* commercial photography, it doesn't say commercial use *requires* a special lens.
* **C: 如果被摄动物怕人 (If the animal being photographed is afraid of people):**  The text mentions animals being afraid of people as a general challenge, but doesn't link this to needing a specific lens.
* **D: 如果公园有关于野生动物摄影的特殊规定 (If the park has special regulations regarding wildlife photography):** Regulations are mentioned, but not in relation to lens requirements.



"
以下哪种情况在文中没有被提到是野生动物摄影师的潜在挑战？,"The correct answer is **C: 获取所需类型的镜头**.

Here's why:

* **A: 寻找某些珍稀动物** - The passage explicitly states: ""许多珍稀动物很难找到"" (Many rare animals are difficult to find).
* **B: 应对攻击性动物** - The passage says: ""野生动物有的...具有攻击性"" (Some wildlife are... aggressive).
* **D: 在潜在的敌对环境中工作** - The passage mentions: ""环境可能寒冷、炎热或恶劣"" (The environment can be cold, hot, or harsh).
* **C: 获取所需类型的镜头** - While the passage *mentions* that different lenses are needed for different subjects (long lenses vs. lenses for bird flocks or small creatures), it **doesn't state that *obtaining* those lenses is a challenge**. It simply notes their use.  It assumes the photographer *has* the right equipment as a prerequisite (""精良的设备，缺一不可"" - good equipment is essential).

Therefore, getting the right type of lens is not presented as a *challenge* in the passage, making it the correct answer.



"
以下哪种情况可能最不会给翻越山口的驾车者带来问题？,"The correct answer is **A: 交通拥堵**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on weather-related dangers.** The entire text warns about snow, ice, freezing temperatures, and their effects on driving. Traffic congestion, while an inconvenience, isn't directly caused by these weather conditions. It's a separate issue.
* **B, C, and D are all directly mentioned as problems:**
    * **B: 摩擦力很小 (Low friction)** is stated explicitly as a danger of ice and snow.
    * **C: 水珠过多 (Too much water droplets)** is mentioned as potentially obstructing visibility.
    * **D: 能见度降低 (Reduced visibility)** is also explicitly mentioned as a result of snow and ice.

Therefore, traffic congestion is the least likely issue *specifically* related to the dangers highlighted in the passage.
"
关于各个国家的所得税，以下哪个方面可能是保持一致的？,"The correct answer is **C: 申报地点**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""国家不同，所得税的结构是不同的，税率和税率等级也有很大的差异."" (Tax structures, rates, and brackets vary greatly between countries.) This eliminates A, B, and D.
* While the specific *details* of where you declare income will vary, the fundamental need to *declare* income to the host country is consistent for non-diplomats working abroad. You will always need to file taxes *somewhere* in the country where you are earning income.

Therefore, **C** is the most likely aspect to be consistently required, even if the *how* and *where exactly* differ.



"
根据这段文字，如果你在海外工作，但所在地在其他地方，你可能会在哪里申报所得税？,"The correct answer is **C: 在你目前工作的国家**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""unless you are a diplomat, generally you need to pay income tax to the country/region where you are working abroad.""  This directly indicates you'd declare and pay taxes in the country where you are *working*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 在你通常所在的地方** - The passage focuses on taxes in the *host* country, not your home country.
*   **B: 美国** - The passage only mentions the US as an example of a country with federal *and* local taxes, it doesn't say everyone pays taxes there.
*   **D: 在费用最低的地方** - While people might *want* to pay taxes where it's cheapest, the passage doesn't suggest that's legal or possible.

以下哪项不是对世界博览会的准确描述？,"The correct answer is **B: 植物展览与艺术和教育展览同时进行**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** World Expos showcase art and science, with countries exhibiting art, education, world issues, culture, and history.  It *separately* states that World Horticultural Expos focus on flowers, plants, and gardening. This implies they are *different* events, not happening simultaneously within the same World Expo.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: 展品可能展示一个国家的历史或文化** - The passage explicitly says ""展示...本国的文化和历史"" (exhibit their own culture and history).
* **C: 活动可能持续长达六个月** - The passage states the duration is ""通常从三到六个月不等"" (usually from three to six months).
* **D: 各国不是必须参与的** - The passage doesn't state participation is mandatory; it simply says countries *participate* by having pavilions.

以下哪项是世界博览会或国际博览会的规则？,"The correct answer is **B: 同一个国家不能每年主办展览**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""虽然理论上世博会可以每年举行一次（只要在不同的国家举办就行），但实际上并非如此。"" This translates to ""Although theoretically Expos can be held annually (as long as they are in different countries), this is not actually the case."" This directly implies a country cannot host every year.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage states exhibits *can* showcase history and world problems, but it's not a *must*. It also mentions art and education.
* **C:** The passage says the duration is *from* three to six months, not *must* be six months.
* **D:** The passage doesn't mention anything about all countries being required to participate.

以下哪种做法可能会降低动物攻击的可能性？,"The correct answer is **B: 清理营地的垃圾 (Cleaning up the campsite trash)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""此外，要注意气味会引来熊和其他野生动物，因此要避免携带或烹饪散发气味的食物，并保持营地清洁 (Furthermore, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food, and keep your campsite clean).""  Cleaning up trash removes those attractants, reducing the likelihood of an encounter and therefore an attack.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 携带芳香草药 (Carrying aromatic herbs):** The passage doesn't mention this, and it could potentially *attract* animals.
* **C: 与狼保持 25 码的距离 (Maintaining a 25-yard distance from wolves):** The passage states to maintain *at least 100 yards/meters* from bears and wolves.  25 yards is too close.
* **D: 用食物残渣来阻止动物 (Using food scraps to deter animals):** This is explicitly dangerous and the opposite of what the passage advises.  The passage emphasizes *avoiding* food smells.



"
以下哪种情况在文中没有被提及是动物攻击的可能原因？,"The correct answer is **D: 不熟悉人类的动物**.

Here's why:

* **A: 强烈气味** - The text explicitly states, ""要注意气味会引来熊和其他野生动物"" (Pay attention to smells that can attract bears and other wildlife). This links smell to potential encounters.
* **B: 未能保持距离** - The text directly states, ""每年，数十名游客都会因未能保持适当距离而受伤"" (Dozens of visitors are injured each year for failing to keep a proper distance).
* **C: 喂食野生动物** - The very first sentence argues against feeding animals: ""我们不应该去喂养或打扰它们"" (We should not feed or disturb them).  While not stated as a *direct* cause of attack, interfering with wildlife (like feeding) is discouraged because it can lead to dangerous encounters.
* **D: 不熟悉人类的动物** - The text focuses on the inherent danger of *any* wild animal, even those accustomed to humans. It doesn't mention attacks being caused by animals unfamiliar with people. The emphasis is on their wild nature and size, regardless of their familiarity.

Therefore, **D** is the only option *not* mentioned as a potential factor leading to animal attacks in the passage.
